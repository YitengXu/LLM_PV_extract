    , Accepted 14th September 2015First published on 14th September 2015AbstractRecycling waste iron slag to produce a high value-added product is of crucial importance to the steel industry, in terms of waste management, as well as to other industries searching for more attractive raw materials. Herein, we report a novel and facile approach to synthesize highly mesoporous silicon derived from waste iron slag. Simple acid leaching of iron slag leads to the generation of mesopores, and a subsequent magnesiothermic reaction with sodium chloride converts silica to silicon without the collapse of the nanostructure. Owing to the three-dimensionally interconnected and highly porous structure with a small crystallite size (∼10 nm), the converted mesoporous silicon, when used as a Li-ion battery anode, exhibits superior cycle performance and rate capability, compared with commercial silicon materials. We expect the synthesis of nanostructured silicon by recycling waste iron slag and its successful application to open up new avenues in the field of sustainable industrial development.
1. Introduction
With the development of industries and the associated expansion in the scale of production, an enormous amount of industrial waste is produced annually. It is generally considered a nuisance, which not only requires extra cost for treatment but also contaminates the environment, and thus, its effective management and disposal is one of the most concerning issues of the global industry. However, from a different point of view, mass-produced waste has the potential to be used as an abundant and cheap resource for new products. This is why the development of new processes that generate high value-added products from industrial waste has attracted great attention as a technical breakthrough from both an economic and environmental point of view.
Ferrous slag, a waste material produced from large-scale industrial sources, is a byproduct generated during the production of iron and steel.1 The annual production of ferrous slag is estimated to be in the 400–500 million tons range, which accounts for nearly one-third of the total amount of global inorganic waste.2 Although ferrous slag has been recycled as a resource for hydraulic cement, concrete aggregate, and pavement materials, it is still disregarded in the steel industry owing to the very low profit that it generates.1 Moreover, as the global production of iron and steel has increased, the output of ferrous slag has exceeded the demand for recycling; a large amount of ferrous slag is just disposed in landfills or oceans, so extra costs for disposal, as well as environmental pollution problems have been increasing.2 For these reasons, adding value through the exploitation of new applications of ferrous slag is one of the important challenges we face today. Ferrous slag is composed of various oxides such as SiO2, CaO, Al2O3, MgO, Fe2O3, and TiO2.3,4 In particular, iron slag, one type of ferrous slag produced in the iron making process in the 270–320 million tons range, has a high content of SiO2 (∼35 wt%),5 which makes iron slag a potential source of silica for various silicon-based materials. Therefore, it is expected that the efficient utilization of the silica component in iron slag provides a new way to synthesize high value-added products, i.e., nanostructured silica6 and its derivatives such as silicon (Si).
Si materials have been studied in many applications, such as photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,7 biotechnology,8 solar cells,9 and Li-ion batteries,10 owing to their unique physical and chemical properties.11 In particular, Si has, in recent years, attracted great attention as an advanced anode material for Li-ion batteries (LIBs).12 The stoichiometry of the Li–Si alloy allows a large theoretical capacity (4200 mA h g−1), which is more than 10 times that of conventional graphite anodes (∼372 mA h g−1).13 However, a large volume change (∼300%) of Si upon Li insertion and extraction during cycling leads to severe pulverization of the electrode and loss of electrical contact, and consequently poor cycle performance.13 Many recent studies have shown that nanostructured Si, including nanoparticles,14,15 nanowires,16–19 nanotubes,20 and nanoporous Si12,13,21,22 can alleviate the pulverization problem by accommodating the expansion in volume, thereby improving the electrochemical performance. However, there have been several critical drawbacks to preparing nanostructured Si, such as the use of high cost or toxic Si precursors,13,15,18,19 requirement of a noble metal or preformed templates,16,17,20–22 and harsh reaction conditions.14,18,19 Therefore, it is imperative to develop a low-cost and simple process for the production of nanostructured Si using abundant and cheap resources as raw materials.
In this work, we developed a facile route to fabricate highly mesoporous Si from waste iron slag via simple acid treatment, followed by a magnesiothermic reduction reaction using a heat scavenger (Fig. 1). Highly porous silica with uniform mesopores (Porous-SiO2slag) was produced very simply and inexpensively; the process requires only acid leaching to remove inorganic substances, followed by a heat treatment process to remove residual impurities. In order to convert Porous-SiO2slag to porous Si (Porous-Sislag) while retaining its high surface area and uniform mesopores, we adopted a modified magnesiothermic reduction reaction employing NaCl as a heat scavenger.23 The heat scavenger helped to preserve the original mesoporous structure of Porous-SiO2slag by absorbing the excess heat released during the reduction reaction; through a similar approach, the conversion of silica foam, which was synthesized from a block co-polymer and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), to mesoporous Si without aggregation was also reported recently.24 The resulting Porous-Sislag contains micro-sized particles composed of nanosized primary Si particles, and it has a surface area of 438 m2 g−1, one of the highest values among porous Si materials reported to date.7,12,13,21,25–28 Because of the highly mesoporous structure with a small crystallite size (∼10 nm), the Porous-Sislag delivers superior cycle performance and rate capability as an anode for LIBs compared with commercially available silicon nanoparticles and microparticles. This demonstration of a method to increase the value of wastes will stimulate the development of new re-use methods for sustainable industrial development.

2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Silicon nanoparticles (∼100 nm, 99%, plasma synthesized) and silicon microparticles (1–5 micron, 99.9%, metal basis) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Alginic acid sodium salt was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. The iron slag is composed of CaO (43.3 wt%), SiO2 (34.5 wt%), Al2O3 (13.3 wt%), MgO (3.6 wt%), TiO2 (1.7 wt%), and Fe2O3 (1.1 wt%).
2.2. Synthesis of Porous-Sislag from iron slag
Large slag particles were first ground to fabricate fine powder using a ball-mill operating at 120 rpm for 5 h to facilitate dissolution. The obtained slag powder was leached with 5 M HCl solution at 80 °C for 5 h to remove the metal oxides. After thermal treatment at 700 °C for 2 h, Porous-SiO2slag was obtained with a purity of 98.7 wt%. The Porous-Sislag was reduced by modified magnesiothermic reduction. 0.3 g of the Porous-Sislag was mixed with 0.6 g of NaCl in water solution, followed by heating at 60 °C under stirring and drying under vacuum at 150 °C to remove the water. The dried Porous-SiO2slag/NaCl powder was thoroughly ground along with 0.27 g Mg powder and sealed in a 5/8 in. Swagelok brass union capped with two 5/8 in. Swagelok stainless steel plugs inside an Ar-filled glovebox. Then, the reactor was heated inside a tube furnace at 650 °C for 2.5 h under an Ar atmosphere. The obtained products were first stirred in a H2O/EtOH solution to remove NaCl, and soaked in 1 M HCl to selectively dissolve magnesia. The product was then exposed to a 5 wt% HF solution (over less than 10 minutes) to ensure the removal of residual silica. After washing with DI water and drying under vacuum, Porous-Sislag was obtained with a yield of 0.1 g. For synthesizing the Bulk-Sislag, the same procedure was followed except for the addition of NaCl. And then, the collected product was purified with the mixture of HF and CH3COOH solution at 70 °C for 1 h. For carbon coating, 0.1 g of Porous-Sislag was physically mixed with 0.1 g of sucrose. Thereafter, the mixture was carbonized at 700 °C for 2 h under an argon atmosphere. The content of carbon in the C-Porous-Sislag (carbon coated Porous-Sislag) was ∼12 wt%.
2.3. Material characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a D/max-2500 diffractometer (Rigaku, Cu Kα radiation). The morphologies were obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with an S-4200 field-emission SEM (Hitachi), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with a JEM-1011 microscope (JEOL LTD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) with a JEM-2200FS microscope (JEOL LTD). An EDS attached to the SEM apparatus was used for local elemental analyses. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiments were performed at 77 K using a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 system. The surface area of the samples was calculated according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and the pore volumes were taken at the P/Po = 0.995 single point. The pore size distributions were calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method from the adsorption branches of the isotherms. The chemical compositions of iron slag and Porous-SiO2slag were determined by using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) (ICPE-9000, Shimadzu). A Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, LabRAM HR) was used with a laser at 514.532 nm (Ar-ion laser) at a power of 0.5 mW.
2.4. Electrochemical characterization
To prepare the electrode, the active materials (C-Porous-Sislag, C-Si-nano, or C-Si-micro) were mixed with a binder (alginic acid sodium salt) and conducting carbon (Super P) at a ratio of 6:2:2 by weight with distilled water. The resulting slurries were coated onto a copper foil, and then dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 110 °C. The average mass loading of active materials was 0.4 mg cm−2. Coin-type cells (CR2032) were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox, in which lithium foil was used as the reference and counter electrode and 1.3 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/ethyl methyl carbonate (EC/EMC, 3:7 volume ratio, PANAX E-TEC Co., Korea) with 10 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate was used as the electrolyte. Using a WBCS-3000 battery cycler (WonATech Co., Korea), the galvanostatic charge/discharge analyses were conducted in the potential range of 0.01 to 1.0 V (vs. Li/Li+). All electrodes were pre-activated in the first two cycles at 200 mA g−1 and cycled at various current rates (200 to 10000 mA g−1) thereafter. The specific capacities and current rates were calculated based on the mass of silicon only. To characterize the morphology of silicon after cycling, the cells were disassembled in an argon-filled glovebox, and the working electrodes were washed with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) several times.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and characterization of Porous-Sislag from iron slag
Porous-SiO2slag was obtained from iron slag by acid etching followed by heat-treatment in air (Fig. 1). The large slag particles were first ground to fine powder in a ball-mill to facilitate the dissolution of metallic species. HCl etching of slag removed most metal oxides such as CaO, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and MgO by the formation of water-soluble metal chlorides, but left SiO2, which has a highly mesoporous structure. Calcination at 700 °C to remove any residual impurities after etching29 yielded high purity Porous-SiO2slag. Fig. 2 shows the characterization of ball-milled slag and Porous-SiO2slag. As shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 2b and d), the particles of ball-milled slag had a size distribution of 2–30 μm, an irregular bulk morphology, and a smooth surface. After acid leaching, followed by heat treatment, the overall particle size of Porous-SiO2slag was reduced to a range of 1–10 μm, and a rough surface composed of interconnected primary particles with a size of ∼30 nm was observed (Fig. 2d and f). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shows that porous structures were generated between primary particles (Fig. 2f). To examine the compositions, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping was conducted. In the iron slag particles, Si, Mg, Al, Ca, Ti and Fe were detected (Fig. 2g), i.e., SiO2, MgO, Al2O3, CaO, TiO2 and Fe2O3 are components in the particles. In contrast, the resulting Porous-SiO2slag showed only pure SiO2 (Fig. 2h). This disappearance of other metal oxides was also confirmed by elemental analysis using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES); SiO2 comprised 98.7 wt% of Porous-SiO2slag (Fig. S1a†). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Porous-SiO2slag also exhibits a broad peak, which is typical of amorphous silica (Fig. S1b†). The highly porous structure of Porous-SiO2slag was proved by the analysis of nitrogen sorption isotherms (Fig. 3a). The surface area and pore volume of Porous-SiO2slag were 570 m2 g−1 and 0.58 cm3 g−1, respectively. The diameter of the main pores was determined to be 6 nm, estimated from the adsorption branch of isotherms using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method (Fig. 3b). These results indicate that simple acid leaching of iron slag generated uniform mesopores with a large surface area; because metallic oxide species might be interconnected with nanometer dimensions in the raw iron slag, leaching them out by using acid solution naturally formed interconnected pores with nanometer dimensions.

To convert Porous-SiO2slag to Porous-Sislag, we used a commercially available Swagelok reactor to conduct the magnesiothermic reduction reaction with sodium chloride (NaCl) as a heat scavenger. Si is obtained by the following magnesiothermic reduction reaction: SiO2 (s) + 2 Mg (g) → Si (s) + 2 MgO (s).30 NaCl was used to consume the large amount of heat released from the exothermic reaction during the magnesiothermic reduction (for Mg (g), ΔH = −586.7 kJ/molSiO2), and thereby preserve the structure of the material.23 After removing NaCl and other byproducts (such as MgO and Mg2Si), Porous-Sislag having an interconnected mesoporous structure was finally produced. Meanwhile, aggregated Si particles (Bulk-Sislag) were obtained by the same process using Porous-SiO2slag without the addition of a heat scavenger (NaCl). The XRD patterns of the Porous-Sislag and Bulk-Sislag (Fig. 4a) both show main diffraction peaks that correspond to the standard pattern of Si (JCPDS no. 27-1402). Compared with the XRD pattern of Bulk-Sislag, the diffraction peaks of Porous-Sislag are much broader. The crystallite size of Si calculated using the Debye–Scherrer equation is ∼10 nm in Porous-Sislag, while it is >50 nm in Bulk-Sislag. These results indicate that significant sintering of Si in Porous-Sislag was minimized owing to the heat-scavenging effect of NaCl during the magnesiothermic reduction reaction. The existence of impurity peaks, which correspond to MgF2 (JCPDS no. 72-2231), in the XRD pattern of Bulk-Sislag could be explained as follows: first, in the absence of NaCl, the heat generated by the exothermic magnesium reduction reaction led to the formation of Mg2SiO4, which is the byproduct of the reaction between Mg (g) and SiO2 (s) or MgO (s) and Si (s) at temperatures >1100 °C;31,32 the peaks of Mg2SiO4 and Si in the XRD patterns after removing MgO and Mg2Si by HCl treatment show clear evidence of this reaction (Fig. S2†). After the second leaching with HF and acetic acid to remove Mg2SiO4,33,34 the peaks of Mg2SiO4 disappeared and MgF2 peaks appeared due to the reaction of Mg2SiO4 with HF.35 In this sense, introduction of a heat scavenger is crucial to prevent the formation of undesirable side products, such as Mg2SiO4, as well as to prevent significant sintering of Si.

The effectiveness of the heat scavenger could be also seen in SEM images (Fig. 4b–d). Bulk-Sislag had a smooth surface and included large Si crystals (Fig. 4b); these characteristics mean that the structure of Bulk-Sislag was completely collapsed compared to Porous-SiO2slag owing to the excessive heat released from exothermic reduction reactions. However, Porous-Sislag had a rough surface consisting of interconnected particles with a size of less than 30 nm, and a particle size of 1–5 μm (Fig. 4c and d); i.e., due to the dissipation of released heat by the addition of the heat scavenger, the structure of Porous-SiO2slag was almost preserved.23 The corresponding EDX spectrum of Porous-Sislag also indicates the pure phase of the crystalline Si (Fig. S3†).
TEM (Fig. 5a) and high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM images (Fig. 5b) show the highly porous structure of Porous-Sislag, which consists of interconnected nanosized-frameworks. The crystalline structure of Porous-Sislag is also demonstrated in the high resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern. The measured lattice plane distance in the HR-TEM image is ∼0.31 nm, which is consistent with the Si(111) lattice (Fig. 5c). The SAED pattern shows a diffraction ring indexed to the Si lattice (Fig. 5d), which is in agreement with XRD analysis (Fig. 4a).

To examine the porosity of all the materials, nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured (Fig. 3a). The surface area of the starting ball-milled slag was only 0.9 m2 g−1; this value significantly increased to 570 m2 g−1 for Porous-SiO2slag. The surface area of Porous-Sislag was 438 m2 g−1, which is slightly smaller than that of Porous-SiO2slag. However, considering that Si is denser than SiO2, we can conclude that the nanostructure of Porous-SiO2slag is almost preserved after the magnesiothermic reduction process (textural properties are summarized in Table S1†). The pore size distributions calculated using the BJH method show that the main pore size is ∼6 nm in Porous-SiO2slag and ∼8 nm in Porous-Sislag (Fig. 3b). We consider that the formation and subsequent removal of MgO induced slight expansion of mesopores in the Porous-Sislag. In contrast, Bulk-Sislag has a much lower surface area of 5.6 m2 g−1 and negligible mesoporosity owing to the structural collapse of Porous-SiO2slag during the magnesiothermic reduction reaction.
3.2. Electrochemical performance of Porous-Sislag
To examine the electrochemical properties of Porous-Sislag as an anode for LIBs, Porous-Sislag was coated with carbon using sucrose (C-Porous-Sislag) to increase the electronic conductivity of electrodes.36–38 Sucrose is also a very cheap and abundant resource, and it can be used to coat carbon on the surface of inorganic supports.39–41 Because the surface area of Porous-Sislag was very large, a relatively large amount of sucrose was used for the carbon coating. Nonetheless, carbon ash or free-standing carbon was not observed on the C-Porous-Sislag (Fig. S4†). The HR-TEM image of C-Porous-Sislag shows the lattice plane distance (∼0.31 nm) of Si(111) and the amorphous carbon layer coated on the surface (Fig. S5a†). The HR-TEM image revealed that the thickness of the carbon coating on the Porous-Sislag was ∼4 nm, and elemental analysis indicated that the content of carbon was 12 wt%. The surface area of C-Porous-Sislag was 261 m2 g−1. Considering the content of carbon, the surface area of Porous-Sislag decreased significantly after carbon coating; this result indicates that carbon was deposited not only on the outer surfaces but also inside the pores, which affected the surface properties of Porous-Sislag.42 However, C-Porous-Sislag remained porous after carbonization (Fig. S5b†). The Raman spectrum of C-Porous-Sislag (Fig. S5c†) showed peaks at 1350 cm−1 (D band, disordered) and 1600 cm−1 (G band, graphitic), which are characteristic of amorphous carbon layers.43,44
The electrochemical behaviors of C-Porous-Sislag as an anode for LIBs were evaluated by using galvanostatic measurements. Two kinds of commercially available Si particles (Fig. S6 and Table S1†) were chosen for use as control groups: microparticles (Si-micro, average size: 1–5 μm) that are similar in secondary particle size to Porous-Sislag and nanoparticles (Si-nano, average size: 100 nm) that are expected to show a relatively good buffer effect and structural integrity. Both types of particles were coated with carbon using sucrose (C-Si-micro and C-Si-nano, respectively), and used in electrochemical tests. Discharging (lithiation) and charging (delithiation) were performed in the voltage range of 0.01–1.0 V versus Li/Li+. To activate the Si electrode before the evaluation of cycle properties or rate capabilities, all test cells were operated at a low current density (200 mA g−1) in the first two cycles. Detailed conditions for measurements are described in the Experimental section.
In C-Porous-Sislag at a current density of 200 mA g−1 from 1 to 10 cycles (Fig. 6a), a slope between 1.0 and 0.2 V is caused by the formation of a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and decomposition of surface oxides occurred during the first discharge, followed by a plateau (below ∼0.2 V) that corresponds to the lithiation of crystalline Si.45 Throughout the first cycle, a kind of activation step, morphology transition and lithiation of native oxide on the surface proceeded.28 Accordingly, voltage profiles of subsequent cycles presented the characteristics of amorphous Si, and became stable as activation was completed. The voltage profiles of C-Porous-Sislag also reflect electrochemical behaviors affected by their unique morphology. The exposure of a large surface area to the electrolyte induces large irreversible reactions related to the SEI layer and native oxide,46 whereas small crystalline Si (∼10 nm, calculated from the XRD pattern) that makes up the porous framework affects the reaction voltage of Si.47 Therefore, compared to the voltage profiles of C-Si-micro and C-Si-nano (Fig. S7†), the slope between 1.0 and 0.2 V is longer and the plateau below ∼0.2 V is less flat during the first discharge (Fig. 6a). Although such features of Porous-Sislag led to low initial coulombic efficiency, the comparison of voltage profiles after the first cycle shows the superior stability of C-Porous-Sislag with a large capacity. Different from the control groups that exhibit a decrease in capacity (Fig. S7†), the charge/discharge curves of C-Porous-Sislag (Fig. 6a) were almost unchanged after the second cycle.

(b) Cycling properties of C-Porous-Sislag, C-Si-nano and C-Si-micro at a current density of 1000 mA g−1. (c) Extended cycling properties and coulombic efficiency of C-Porous-Sislag at a current density of 1000 mA g−1. (d) Rate performances of C-Porous-Sislag, C-Si-nano, and C-Si-micro. 
The superior electrochemical stability of C-Porous-Sislag was further confirmed by a cycling test at a relatively high current density of 1000 mA g−1 (Fig. 6b and S8†). The anomalous trends of discharge capacity in the early stage of the cycling test may be caused by a decrease in capacity due to additional segregation or detachment of particles during the initial cycles, followed by the gradual stabilization of Si at high current densities.48 Similar trends were observed in previous studies that used the β-cyclodextrin polymer or alginate as a binder (at current rates of 2000–4000 mA g−1).48,49 Therefore, for fair comparison, capacity retentions were considered in the range between the cycle of maximum capacity since the 10th cycle and thereafter 50 cycles. C-Porous-Sislag had a maximum capacity of 1566 mA h g−1 (at the 30th cycle), and a capacity of 1521 mA h g−1 at the 80th cycle (Fig. 6b); this result indicates that almost 97% of discharge capacity was retained over 50 cycles, and that C-Porous-Sislag has excellent cycle properties. In contrast, C-Si-micro showed an abrupt decrease of capacity from 1054 mA h g−1 (10th cycle) to 522 mA h g−1 (60th cycle), i.e., a retention of only 50% of capacity. Even in the case of nano-sized Si particles (C-Si-nano), the capacity retention ratio was 86% (from 1424 mA h g−1 at the 10th cycle to 1225 mA h g−1 at the 60th cycle) which is less than that of C-Porous-Sislag. C-Porous-Sislag achieved a capacity of 1207 mA h g−1 even after 300 cycles (Fig. 6c), which corresponds to 77% of its maximum capacity; it also retained ∼100% coulombic efficiency. Such an excellent cycle stability and reversibility of C-Porous-Sislag originated from its unique morphology. Large void spaces in the mesoporous structure effectively buffer the severe volume expansion of Si during lithiation.12 Interconnected pore structures provide porous Si with resistance to structural deformation caused by internal and external stress. Therefore, undesirable cracking and crumbling were alleviated, and SEI layers that formed during initial cycles were stabilized.13,27 SEM images of C-Porous-Sislag and C-Si-nano and C-Si-micro electrodes taken after 50 cycles demonstrate the structural stability of C-Porous-Sislag under cycling tests (Fig. S9†). In contrast to C-Si-micro, in which disastrous electrode pulverization occurred during cycling, C-Porous-Sislag retained the interconnected porous feature of the particles. These properties are reflected in the excellent cycle properties of C-Porous-Sislag, compared to micro-sized Si particles that are similar in size to Porous-Sislag. Although nano-sized Si particles are effective for use in electrodes of LIBs,50 and the structure of C-Si-nano seems to be not significantly changed after cycling (Fig. S9b†), relatively inferior cycle properties may be caused by pulverization or electric disconnection of individual small particles.26
The results of the rate capability test also demonstrate the superiority of C-porous-Sislag as an electrode for LIBs (Fig. 6d and S10†). In the whole range of current densities, C-Porous-Sislag showed high discharge capacities and low reduction ratios on the basis of initial capacity measured at 200 mA g−1, compared to those of control groups (C-Si-micro and C-Si-nano). Even at a high current density of 10 A g−1, C-Porous-Sislag shows a discharge capacity of ∼540 mA h g−1, which is almost three times that of C-Si-nano. We infer that the main reason for the excellent rate properties of C-Porous-Sislag is that electrochemical reactions of Si proceed easily because the large surface area and thin framework of Porous-Sislag provide large electrode/electrolyte interfaces and a short diffusion pathway for Li ions and electrons.22
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the successful use of waste iron slag as a raw material to produce highly mesoporous Si for high-performance Li-ion battery anodes. Highly mesoporous silica was produced by simple acid leaching of iron slag, and subsequent magnesiothermic reduction with a heat scavenger led to the conversion of silica to Si without structure collapse. Owing to its unique mesostructure, the resultant porous Si exhibited superior cycle stability and rate capability compared to commercial Si materials. Because iron slag has been produced annually as a massive byproduct of the iron making process, its use as high value-added materials in this study has great practical and economic value.
