meso-Tetrakis(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)porphyrinatooxidovanadium (1) and β-octabromo-meso-tetrakis(2,6-dibromo-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)porphyrinatooxidovanadium (2) were synthesized in excellent yields. The synthesized oxidovanadium(IV) porphyrin complexes were characterized by various spectroscopic methods such as UV-Vis, FT-IR, EPR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, as well as by single crystal X-ray crystallography. The acetonitrile coordinated porphyrin 1 is relatively planar whereas 2 is highly nonplanar as shown by their crystal structures and also by electrochemical studies. Selective epoxidation studies of alkenes were successfully carried out in CH3CN/H2O as the solvent mixture at ambient temperature resulting in very high TOF numbers (12227–14347 h−1 for 2) even with low catalyst loadings. Remarkably, 2 biomimics the vanadium bromoperoxidase (VBrPO) enzyme with extremely high TOF values (83333–87719 h−1) for the oxidative bromination of thymol and some other phenols. Both the catalysts were successfully recovered at the end of the reactions, indicating their viability and industrial applicability.
Introduction
Epoxides are very useful precursors as they can be converted into a wide variety of laboratory and industrially important products like surfactants, polyurethanes, resins, glycols etc.1–3 For obtaining epoxides, the main protocol is epoxidation of alkenes with or without the help of catalysts.4 A wide variety of transition metal based catalysts speed up an equally diverse number and type of chemical reactions such as polymerization, oxidation, hydroxylation, coupling and so on.5,6 Porphyrin is an important ligand that forms stable complexes with a variety of metal ions to generate metalloporphyrins.7–10 Metalloporphyrins have good thermal and chemical stability in addition to their strong absorption in the visible region of the spectrum, and are versatile for further modifications in terms of conformational and redox properties.11–13 On account of their customized properties, metalloporphyrins find useful applications in the fields of DSSC (dye sensitized solar cell),10,14 sensing15 and NLO (non-linear optics).16
A number of iron, molybdenum and manganese based metalloporphyrins have been used as homogeneous catalysts for oxygenation reactions.17–19 These catalysts, however, suffer from some snags like (a) the macrocyclic ring is quite susceptible to oxidative cleavage; (b) aggregation may occur due to π–π interactions; (c) a lower rate of conversion, i.e. TOF; (d) poor selectivity in terms of products formed during the reaction. However, some metalloporphyrin based heterogeneous catalysts have been reported lately to overcome some of these drawbacks with good efficiency.20,21 Recently, oxidovanadium(IV) porphyrins have gained significant ground as useful moieties with a wide range of applications in the fields of therapeutics and HIV,22 3D-supramolecular assemblies23 and catalysis.24,25 VOTPP and its immediate derivatives have been successfully utilized for the epoxidation of various alkenes under homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions.24,26 However, a low turnover number remains a major drawback of these catalysts, and has therefore become the focus of researchers globally. In addition to molecular oxygen, H2O2 is a widely used, environmentally friendly, biologically relevant and an easy to handle oxidant and in coalition with NaHCO3 as a promoter, it gives good conversion with excellent selectivity for a variety of olefins.27–30 The interaction between NaHCO3 and H2O2 stabilizes the oxidoperoxido intermediates and results in the formation of peroxymonocarbonate ions, which are much stronger nucleophiles as compared to H2O2, thereby increasing the efficiency of the metal catalysts used by many folds.31,32
Terpenes are a useful class of natural products that lead to commercially profitable species which are medicinally important in being anti-microbial, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory etc.33 Oil of thyme extracted from thyme (Thymus vulgaris) contains 20–54% thymol, which has strong antiseptic properties and is used in mouth washes.34,35 Oxidative bromination is an indispensable reaction because the carbon–bromine bond renders the organic compounds more lipophilic and hence biologically more penetrating.36 Traditionally, bromination has been carried out using reagents like liquid bromine,37 hypobromites,38NBS (N-bromosuccinimide)39 and so on. Vanadium dependent haloperoxidases occur naturally in some marine algae, fungi and lichens, and the active center in these vanadate-dependent haloperoxidases is an oxidovanadate(V) coordinated to an imidazole nitrogen atom of the histidine subunit.40 These enzymes catalyze the electrophilic halogenation of organic substrates in the presence of peroxides and the reaction proceeds via oxidation of the halide in question (vide infra). The active species in the catalytic reaction is an oxidoperoxidovanadium(V) intermediate, which is a much stronger oxidizing agent than H2O2.H2O2 + X− + H+ → H2O + HOX (X = Cl, Br, I)
A plethora of structural and/or functional models of vanadium haloperoxidases with oxidovanadium(IV/V) and dioxidovanadium(V) centers coordinated to N, O, and S donor ligands are commonly encountered in the literature.41–43 We have recently reported the catalytic efficacy of an oxidovanadium(IV) porphyrin in the epoxidation of cyclohexene and related alkenes in the presence of H2O2 as the terminal oxidant and NaHCO3 as the catalyst promoter.44 In the current study, we have further extended our efforts towards the application of substituted porphyrins as potential industrial catalysts with huge TOF (h−1) numbers. Herein, we report two substituted porphyrins (1 and 2) bearing diverse electronic environments (Fig. 1), with direct consequences on reactivity and catalytic activity. We have used VOTPP(OMe)8 (1) and VOTPP(OMe)8(Br)16 (2) as catalyst precursors for the oxidation of olefins, considering styrene as the ideal substrate, as well as oxidative bromination of a monoterpenoid, thymol and some other phenols, in the presence of H2O2 as the oxidant. We encountered unprecedented TOF (h−1) numbers and shorter reaction times as compared to literature reports, indicating higher efficiency of the present catalyst systems. Additionally, the catalysts were successfully recovered at the end of the reactions, indicating their stability as well as recyclability for the catalytic reactions.

Results and discussion
Oxidovanadium(IV) porphyrins VOTPP(OMe)8 (1) and VOTPP(OMe)8(Br)16 (2) (Fig. 1) were synthesized using modified literature methods. Free-base 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)porphyrin, H2TPP(OMe)8, was synthesized using pyrrole and 3,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde using the Adler–Longo method.45 VOTPP(OMe)8 (1) was prepared using VOSO4 and DMF under an argon atmosphere in 96% yield.23,44 VOTPP(OMe)8(Br)16 (2) was synthesized from VOTPP(OMe)8 (1) using liq. Br2 as a brominating agent in 83% yield.461 and 2 were characterized by UV-Visible, FT-IR and EPR spectroscopic techniques, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. S1–S5 in ESI†) and single crystal XRD analysis.

Fig. 2 represents the UV-Visible spectra of porphyrins 1 and 2 in CH2Cl2 at 298 K. 1 gave a typical absorption spectrum characteristic of oxidovanadium(IV) porphyrins – one Soret and one Q-band with the Soret band being red shifted (5 nm) as compared to 3,5-dimethoxyphenylporphyrin (H2TPP(OMe)8). Porphyrin 2 exhibited an absorption spectrum which is fairly red-shifted as compared to 1 in terms of the Soret (Δλmax = 38 nm) and Q bands as shown in Fig. 2 and Table S1 in the ESI.† The IR spectrum of 1 shows a characteristic peak at ν ∼ 1005 cm−1 due to (VO) stretching; the coordination was further confirmed by the absence of N–H stretching frequency, which is otherwise observed for free base porphyrin (H2(TPP)(OMe)8) at ν ∼ 3311 cm−1. Similarly, the IR spectrum of 2 exhibits stretching frequencies for the C–Br bond as well as the VO bond at ν ∼ 682 cm−1 and ν ∼ 1031 cm−1, respectively.

Electrochemical studies
Cyclic voltammetric studies of 1 and 2 were carried out in distilled CH2Cl2 at 298 K using Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, Pt as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode and recrystallized TBAPF6 as the supporting electrolyte (Fig. 3). The first oxidation potential of 2 is 340 mV anodically shifted as compared to 1. Similarly, the first reduction potential of 2 is also 320 mV anodically shifted as compared to 1. These results reveal the electron deficient nature of the porphyrin macrocycle (2) due to electron withdrawing hexadecabromo substituents. The first oxidation potential of 2 is 460 mV anodically shifted as compared to H2TPP(OMe)8. Likewise, the first and second reduction potentials of 2 are anodically shifted by 360 mV and 340 mV, respectively, as compared to H2TPP(OMe)8. These results are quite as expected owing to the nonplanarity and presence of more electronegative bromo groups in 2 (Fig. 3).

Thermogravimetric studies
The thermogravimetric profiles of 1 and 2 using alumina powder as the reference were recorded from RT to 1000 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The resulting thermograms are given in Fig. S7 and S8 in the ESI.† Both 1 and 2 displayed good thermal stability with 1 being stable up to 336 °C and 2 being stable up to 273 °C. The lower stability of 2 could be explained based on the fact that the C–Br bond (285 kJ mol−1) is weaker and more labile as compared to the C–O bond (358 kJ mol−1). The thermogravimetric profile of H2TPP(OMe)8 is also given in Fig. S6 in the ESI.†
EPR spectral studies
X-band EPR spectra of 1 and 2 were recorded in distilled toluene. Both 1 and 2 exhibited typical EPR spectra with neatly resolved 51V hyperfine lines at 120 K (Fig. 4). The numbers of lines in the axial EPR spectra of both 1 and 2 were equal to eight, corresponding to the I value of the vanadium nucleus (I = 7/2).
 Fig. 4  X-band EPR spectra of 1 and 2 in toluene at 120 K. EPR parameters: microwave frequency, 9.453 GHz; incident microwave power, 0.189 Mw. 
From the anisotropic EPR spectra, g‖ and g⊥ values were obtained as 1.965 and 1.999, respectively, for 1. For 2, the corresponding values were observed as 1.966 and 2.000, respectively. Similarly, A‖ and A⊥ values were obtained as 160.67 × 10−4 cm−1 and 57.20 × 10−4 cm−1, respectively, for 1. The corresponding values were observed as 158.95 × 10−4 cm−1 and 58.15 × 10−4 cm−1, respectively, for 2. All these values are within the permissible range for axially compressed d1 systems.
DFT studies and geometry optimization
DFT studies to optimize geometries were carried out using the B3LYP functional with the LANL2DZ basis set. Fig. 5 and S9 in the ESI† represent the top and side views of 1 and 2 in their optimized geometries in the gaseous phase. 1 is relatively planar with Δ24 = 0.0311 Å and ΔCβ = ±0.0493 Å from the porphyrin mean plane. However, vanadium is clearly located above the plane by a distance of 0.526 Å. The bond distances VO and Cβ–Cβ were found to be 1.595 Å and 1.372 Å, respectively, in the case of 1. On the other hand, 2 is clearly nonplanar having a saddle shaped conformation with Δ24 = 0.548 Å and ΔCβ = ±1.1135 Å from the porphyrin mean plane. Vanadium metal is located above the plane by about 0.545 Å. The bond distances VO and Cβ–Cβ in the case of 2 were found to be 1.593 Å and 1.378 Å respectively.

Single crystal XRD analysis
Diffraction quality single crystals of both 1 and 2 were obtained by slow diffusion of hexane into their saturated acetonitrile solutions at room temperature. The ORTEPs of 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 6 and the corresponding crystallographic data are listed in Table S2 in the ESI.† The selected average bond lengths and bond angles are listed in Table S3 in the ESI.† The XRD studies confirmed that 1 is relatively planar while 2 is highly distorted (saddle conformation) from the mean plane with the values of Δ24 of 0.030 Å and 0.495 Å in the case of 1 and 2, respectively. β-Pyrrole carbon atoms are also highly deviated from the mean plane in the case of 2 with the corresponding ΔCβ values found to be 0.036 Å and 1.011 Å in the case of 1 and 2, respectively. Similarly, the meso-carbon atoms in 2 are more distorted (ΔCm = 0.044 Å) than meso-carbon atoms (ΔCm = 0.021 Å) in 1. Likewise, the α-pyrrolic carbon atoms in 1 (ΔCα = 0.026 Å) are less deviated from the mean plane as compared to α-pyrrolic carbon atoms in 2 (ΔCα = 0.396 Å). The highly nonplanar nature of 2 makes the macrocycle robust and the hexadeca bromo groups make the porphyrin ring electron efficient. We surmise that these two aspects potentially help porphyrin 2 to perform better in oxidative catalysis as compared 1 and hence we carried out catalytic studies.

Catalytic studies
Epoxidation of olefins
The catalytic efficiency of 1 towards olefin epoxidation was explored by conducting a series of experiments. The catalytic oxidation of styrene by 1 in the presence of H2O2 as the oxidant and NaHCO3 as the promoter gave only one product, i.e., styrene oxide exclusively (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  Catalytic epoxidation of styrene. 
All the reactions were performed in a 50 mL two-neck round bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser over an oil bath. The reaction conditions were optimized by taking styrene as the ideal substrate and 1 as the representative catalyst. The reaction products were quantified using GC/GC-MS analysis. The complete details of the epoxidation of styrene under different reaction conditions are given in the Experimental section and are summarized in Table 1.

The most ideal/optimized conditions for the epoxidation of 5 mmol of styrene in 1 h of reaction time are: catalyst 1 (0.0015 g, 1.63 μmol), 30% aqueous H2O2 (1.69 g, 15 mmol), NaHCO3 (0.126 g, 1.5 mmol), CH3CN:H2O (3:2, 5 mL) and a temperature of 50 °C. The reaction showed excellent selectivity with the formation of styrene oxide as the exclusive product.
To ascertain the role of the catalyst and the promoter in the epoxidation of styrene, we performed some control experiments. In the first control, the reaction was performed under the optimized conditions, but in the absence of the catalyst, and only 21% conversion was observed. Next, the reaction, under optimized conditions but in the absence of both the catalyst and the promoter, gave only 9% conversion.
The efficiency of the catalyst was further supported by performing the reaction using [VO(acac)2] as the catalyst instead of 1 under the optimized conditions; which gave a total conversion of 37% only. Finally, the optimized reaction without the promoter gave 61% conversion. All these results indicate that while the catalyst can satisfactorily catalyze the epoxidation of alkenes, the overall conversion is significantly improved in the presence of the promoter.
We examined the catalytic potential of VOTPP(OMe)8(Br)16 (2) towards olefin epoxidation under the conditions optimized for VOTPP(OMe)8 (1). The bromo derivative (2) was found to be much more active than the corresponding octamethoxy oxidovanadium(IV) porphyrin (1) in the oxidation of alkenes, probably due to the difference in electronic environment around vanadium in the two molecules. Thus, we decided to evaluate the catalytic efficiency of (2) under the reaction conditions as optimized above for (1), but at a lower catalyst loading and a shorter reaction time. Indeed, we observed almost comparable conversions using only half the catalyst amount (ca. 0.7 μmol, 0.0016 g) in merely 0.5 h of reaction time under the conditions optimized above for (1). However, further reducing the catalyst amount to 0.4 μmol rendered 81% conversion in 0.5 h of reaction time for 5 mmol styrene under the conditions optimized for (1); thus, a minimum of 0.7 μmol of (2) was considered to be ideal for catalytic activity under the conditions as optimized above.
The higher TOF values observed in the case of VOTPP(OMe)8(Br)16 (2) as compared to VOTPP(OMe)8 (1) can be seen as a direct consequence of the underlying mechanism for vanadate catalyzed oxidations. Most vanadium catalyzed oxidations are inspired from mimicking the active site of vanadium haloperoxidases (where the activated form of the active site is formed by a vanadium metal coordinated to two oxygen atoms, two histidine units and one peroxo unit47 as compared to four pyrollic nitrogens, one oxygen atom and one peroxo unit in porphyrins 1 and 2). Vanadium haloperoxidases catalyze the oxidation of halides by hydrogen peroxide, thereby achieving the halogenation of organic substrates.48,49 Thus, most vanadium catalyzed oxidations are known to proceed in the presence of peroxides, and the fundamental step of the catalytic cycle involves the formation of an oxido-peroxidovanadium intermediate, which is a much stronger oxidant than H2O2.50,51 The oxido-peroxido vanadium species functions as an electrophilic electron transfer agent while oxidizing the organic substrate;52 this implies that an electron deficient vanadium center would facilitate the formation of the oxido-peroxido intermediate, thus speeding up the reaction. The two derivatives reported in the present study differ greatly in terms of electron density at the oxidovanadium(IV) center. Accordingly, the higher electrophilic nature of vanadium in oxidovanadium(IV) porphyrin 2 can account for its higher reactivity. The relevant data are presented in Table 2.

The epoxidation of olefins catalyzed by bicarbonate activated peroxide was initially investigated by Drago and co-workers in their study of the oxidation of chemical warfare agents and simulant sulphides in mixed tert-butyl alcohol/water solvents53 and was further extended by Richardson et al.,54 who performed a detailed kinetic analysis of bicarbonate mediated oxidations in water/alcohol mixtures. It was suggested that the key aspect of such systems was the equilibrium between the bicarbonate and the peroxide to give a peroxymonocarbonate intermediate (eqn (1)). Such equilibrium could be established in minutes, but the reactions catalyzed only by such systems in the absence of a catalyst required very long reaction times of up to 1–2 days. A fast and efficient epoxidation of olefins catalyzed synergistically by a metal catalyst and bicarbonate activated peroxide has been reported successfully by Burgess et al. using a Mn catalyst.30 HCO3− + H2O2 ⇌ HCO4− + H2O(1)
Therefore, the organic solvent serves to dissolve the product, pushing the equilibrium towards the right, hence “speeding up” the reaction. The mixture of water and an organic solvent additionally allows the homogenization of the reaction mixture, thus facilitating fast reaction kinetics.
Oxidative bromination of thymol
Several model vanadium compounds as structural and/or functional mimics of vanadium haloperoxidases (VHPOs) have been commonly reported in the literature.55–58 Many of these compounds catalyze various oxidations in the presence of peroxide.59,60 We have performed the VHPOs activity in aqueous medium using thymol as the ideal substrate and 2 as the catalyst precursor. The oxidative bromination of thymol carried out in aqueous medium gave three different products, namely, 2-bromothymol, 4-bromothymol and 2,4-dibromothymol (Table 3). The products formed were the same as those reported in previous studies by some of us61,62 and by other authors63 (Scheme 2).

For the chosen complex 2 used as the catalyst precursor, the following parameters were varied to optimize the reaction conditions for 10 mmol (1.500 g) of thymol; (i) the amounts of the catalyst (0.00025 g, 0.00050 g and 0.001 g), (ii) the amounts of HClO4 (10, 20 and 30 mmol), (iii) the amount of KBr (10, 20 and 30 mmol), and (iv) the amount of the oxidant H2O2 (10, 20 and 30 mmol). Table 3 presents the details of conversion under each specified condition. The best suited conditions for the maximum conversion of 10 mmol of thymol (1.500 g) were found to be: catalyst (0.00025 g, 0.114 μmol), KBr (2.38 g, 20 mmol), aqueous 30% H2O2 (2.267 g, 20 mmol), HClO4 (2.87 g, 20 mmol, added in four equal portions of 0.717 g) and 20 mL water (Table 3, entry 4). TOF in this case was found to be a staggering 83333 h−1 with a 95% conversion rate, which is the highest TOF number known for haloperoxidase activity/mimics. Under similar reaction conditions, catalyst 1 (0.00025 g, 0.272 μmol) was much less efficient and gave a conversion of 98% and a TOF of 36029 h−1, respectively, with thymol.
Catalyst 2 was additionally used for the oxidative bromination of 10 mmol each of phenol, para-cresol and salicylaldehyde under the conditions optimized for thymol above. Remarkable conversion rates and TOFs (h−1) were obtained with all the above substrates. With phenol, catalyst 2 exhibited a 100% conversion rate and a TOF of 87719 h−1, with salicylaldehyde a conversion rate of 95% and a TOF of 83333 h−1 were achieved while para-cresol gave a TOF of 87719 h−1 and a conversion rate of 100% under similar conditions. The details are given in Table 4.

Catalytic mechanism
The reaction between the catalyst and H2O2 was monitored by UV-Visible spectral titrations; however, no decisive spectral changes were observed. Thus, in order to ascertain the exact mechanism underlying our study of the epoxidation reactions, MALDI-TOF mass analysis was performed. 1 and 2 (0.02 mol%) were heated with NaHCO3 (0.4 eq.) and H2O2 (2 eq.) in CH3CN at 60 °C for 30 minutes. The reaction mixtures were cooled to room temperature and MALDI-TOF analysis was performed using a HABA matrix. Clear peaks were observed at m/z = 951.18 and m/z = 2213.53 in the case of 1 and 2, respectively, substantiating the formation of the respective oxidoperoxidovanadium(V) species in solution for both the catalysts as shown in Scheme 3 and Fig. S4 and S5 in the ESI.†
 Scheme 3  Catalytic mechanism for the conversion of alkenes into the corresponding epoxides. O.S. refers to the oxidation state of the vanadium metal. 
The higher catalytic efficiency and the resulting higher TOF (h−1) numbers for 2 as compared to 1 are a direct consequence of the electron withdrawing bromo substituents on 2 and the nonplanarity, making the oxidovanadium(IV) center in 2 more electrophilic and thus assisting in the formation of the active oxidoperoxido intermediate. The TOF (h−1) numbers (for epoxidation) were in the range of 2531 to 3031 h−1 for 1 and 12227 to 14347 h−1 for 2 (five folds higher than 1). The UV-Visible spectra of 1 and 2 after being recovered from the catalytic reaction mixtures after the first catalytic cycle matched those of the pure samples depicting their good chemical and thermal stabilities (Fig. S10, ESI†). The efficiency of the recovered catalysts (1 and 2) was examined for the epoxidation of cyclohexene under conditions similar to those used for pure catalysts. Recycled catalyst 1 exhibited a conversion rate of 87% and a TOF of 2719 h−1 with cyclohexene. Similarly, the recycled catalyst 2 exhibited a conversion rate of 90% and a TOF of 13043 h−1 with cyclohexene. The small loss in catalytic efficiency can be explained on the basis that the recovery processes, especially in homogeneous catalysis, are not 100% efficient, which inevitably leads to the loss of some catalyst, more so with low catalyst loadings.
Literature comparison
TOF (h−1) values in case of the epoxidation reaction for 1 and 2 were compared with those reported in the literature (Table 5). It can be seen that, while 1 exhibits TOF values comparable with literature reports, 2 is found to be much more efficient (5–6 folds higher) and thus is a very potent catalyst for the selective epoxidation of alkenes under ambient conditions. Some catalysts have achieved higher TOF values with certain alkenes but their TOF values with general alkenes has been very low (entries 10–13, Table 5). Thus, we can conclude that 2 is a much better catalyst for selectively epoxidizing alkenes irrespective of the nature of the alkene.

Similarly, the TOF (h−1) values for the oxidative bromination of thymol with 2 were also compared to literature reported values (Table 6) and it can be seen that 2 is by far the most efficient catalyst for the oxidative bromination of thymol. On the basis of its efficiency and recyclability, 2 can be said to act as a biomimetic catalyst for vanadium bromoperoxidase enzymes found in living species.

Conclusions
Oxidovanadium(IV) porphyrins 1 and 2 were synthesized in high yields and characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and single crystal X-ray analysis. 1 and 2 exhibited good thermal and chemical stabilities and were successfully utilized as catalysts for the epoxidation of olefins using H2O2/NaHCO3 as the oxidant and CH3CN/H2O as the reaction medium. 2, being more efficient because of its electron deficient nature, steric crowding and nonplanarity, was found to be the best catalyst for the oxidative bromination of thymol and other phenols using H2O2/KBr/HClO4 as a brominating agent in water as well as for epoxidation reactions in aqueous acetonitrile. In addition to showing good efficiency and high TOF numbers, both catalysts were successfully recovered at the end of the reactions. Overall, among different transition metal and organometallic catalysts, the oxidovanadium(IV) porphyrin 2 has exhibited the highest TOF numbers for the epoxidation of alkenes and oxidative bromination of thymol and other phenols known in the literature.

Synthesis of oxidovanadium-5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)porphyrin (1)
Free base 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)porphyrin (500 mg, 0.584 mmol) was dissolved in 100 mL DMF. To this mixture, 10 equiv. of VOSO4 (962 mg, 5.85 mmol) was added. It was stirred for 10 minutes and then refluxed under an inert atmosphere for 16 h. The reaction mixture was cooled, after the completion of the reaction, to room temperature. Distilled water (150 mL) was added afterwards, which led to the formation of a precipitate. It was filtered using a G4 crucible and the precipitate was vacuum dried for 6 h. The dried, crude product was redissolved in CHCl3 and purified over a silica column using CHCl3 as an eluent. The yield was found to be 96% (514 mg, 0.559 mmol).

Catalytic epoxidation of alkenes
The catalytic efficacy of 1 and 2 towards selective epoxidation of alkenes was evaluated using 1 as a representative catalyst. In a typical catalytic reaction, 5 mmol styrene (0.52 g), 15 mmol of 30% H2O2 (1.69 g) and 1.5 mmol NaHCO3 (0.126 g) were mixed with aqueous MeCN (3:2, v/v) in a 50 mL two-neck round bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser. Catalyst 1 (0.0015 g, 1.63 μmol) was added to the reaction mixture, and it was stirred at 500 rpm at 60 °C on an oil bath for 1 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by withdrawing small aliquots of the reaction mixture at 15 minute intervals and extracting them vigorously with hexane. The hexane layer was then analyzed by injecting ca. 0.2 μL into GC/GC-MS. The oxidation products were quantified using a Shimadzu 2010 plus gas-chromatograph equipped with an Rtx-1 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) and an FID detector. The product identities were confirmed using a PerkinElmer GC-MS (Clarus 500). The effects of various reaction parameters such as the amount of catalyst, the amount of oxidant, the amount of NaHCO3, the amount of solvent, the type of solvent and the temperature on the final conversion were also assessed in order to obtain the best optimized reaction conditions for maximum conversion.
First, the solvent ideal for catalytic activity was determined by performing the reactions in 5 mL each of different solvents such as MeCN, H2O, and MeCN/H2O, as well as without any solvent, for 5 mmol (0.52 g) styrene, 15 mmol (1.69 g) of 30% H2O2, 2 mmol (0.168 g) NaHCO3, and 0.0015 g (1.63 μmol) of 1 at 60 °C for 1 h. It was observed that while in MeCN, a total conversion of 77% was achieved, no reaction occurred in any other solvent. A mixture of aqueous and organic solvents is known to accelerate the epoxidation reaction.30,44 Thus, the effect of water dilution was studied by considering three different ratios of MeCN:H2O mixtures, i.e. 2:1, 3:2 and 4:3. Indeed, dilution improved the conversion to 81% for a 2:1 ratio, and furthermore to 90% for a 3:2 ratio, but more dilutions with water did not improve the conversion significantly. Thus, a mixture of 3 mL MeCN and 2 mL H2O was chosen as the best solvent to achieve the maximum conversion (entry no. 3, Table 1).
Next, the amount of catalyst was optimized. To achieve this, three parallel reactions were performed taking different amounts of the catalyst, viz. 0.0010 g, 0.0015 g and 0.0020 g, while keeping all other parameters constant, i.e. 5 mmol (0.52 g) styrene, 15 mmol (1.69 g) 30% H2O2, 2 mmol (0.168 g) NaHCO3, and 5 mL MeCN/H2O (3:2) at 60 °C for 1 h. The conversion significantly improved from 74% to 90% on increasing the catalyst amount from 0.0010 g to 0.0015 g. However, no further increment in conversion was observed upon further increasing the catalyst amount, for example, to 0.0020 g (91%). Thus, the catalyst amount 0.0015 g (1.63 μmol) was considered as the optimal catalyst amount for obtaining the best conversion (entry no. 3, Table 1).
The effect of the oxidant amount, 30% H2O2, for 5 mmol (0.52 g) of styrene in the presence of 0.0015 g of catalyst and 2 mmol (0.168 g) of NaHCO3 was determined by performing the reactions in different styrene to H2O2 molar ratios of 1:1 (5 mmol (0.565 g) 30% H2O2), 1:2 (10 mmol (1.13 g) 30% H2O2) and 1:3 (15 mmol (1.69 g) 30% H2O2) in 5 mL MeCN/H2O (3:2) at 60 °C for 1 h. The lowest conversion of 15% was achieved using 5 mmol of 30% H2O2. However, the conversion significantly improved to 78% and 90% for 10 mmol and 15 mmol of 30% H2O2, respectively, indicating that 15 mmol of 30% H2O2 was required to achieve the maximum reaction conversion (entry no. 3, Table 1).
Next, the amount of the promoter NaHCO3 was optimized to obtain the maximum reaction conversion. For this, three different amounts of NaHCO3, 1 mmol (0.084 g), 1.5 mmol (0.126 g) and 2 mmol (0.168 g), were taken, keeping all other factors constant such as 5 mmol (0.52 g) styrene, 15 mmol (1.69 g) 30% H2O2, and 0.0015 g (1.63 μmol) of 1 at 60 °C. After 1 h of reaction time, while an increase in conversion from 77% to 89% was achieved on increasing the NaHCO3 amount from 1 mmol to 1.5 mmol, a further increment in the amount of NaHCO3 did not affect the final conversion and 2 mmol of NaHCO3 gave 90% conversion. Thus 1.5 mmol of NaHCO3 was considered the optimum amount (entry no. 10, Table 1).
The dependence of the reaction rate on temperature was determined by performing the reaction at three different temperatures, viz. 40 °C, 50 °C and 60 °C under the conditions optimized above for 1 h. While at 40 °C, only 34% conversion was achieved, raising the temperature to 50 °C significantly improved the conversion to 87% in 1 h (entry no. 11, Table 1). At 60 °C a conversion of 89% was achieved in 1 h.
Vanadium haloperoxidase activity: oxidative bromination of thymol
Vanadium haloperoxidases type activity towards oxidative bromination of thymol and other phenols was evaluated using the more active catalyst 2. In a typical reaction, thymol (1.5002 g, 10 mmol), KBr (2.38 g, 20 mmol), H2O2 (2.2665 g, 20 mmol) and water (20 mL) were taken in a 50 mL reaction flask. The catalyst (0.00025 g, 0.114 μmol) and HClO4 (0.717 g, 0.5 mmol) were added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature. An additional 1.5 mmol of HClO4 was added in three equal portions at intervals of fifteen minutes. After 2 h the reaction mixture was extracted with diethyl ether (or hexane), washed with a brine (NaCl) solution and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The reaction products were separated using a silica gel column. The products were analyzed and identified by GC, GC-MS and 1H NMR.
