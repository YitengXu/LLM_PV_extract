    , Accepted 25th July 2019First published on 29th July 2019AbstractPhotocorrosion is regarded as an important limitation of cupric oxide (CuO) for application in photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis. In this paper, we firstly explore the photocorrosion mechanism of a CuO photocathode in the photoelectrocatalysis field and reveal that self-reduction of CuO caused by photogenerated electrons is a prime factor for the photocorrosion of the CuO photocathode. Aiming to solve this issue, TiO2 is introduced on the surface of CuO to form a suitable gradient band level, which is conducive to the fast export of photo-induced electrons in the bulk of CuO. Besides, a Pt cocatalyst as an electron capture layer (ECL) is selected to load on top of the CuO/TiO2 photoelectrode, further promoting the transport of electrons, thereby improving the photocorrosion stability of the CuO photocathode. Under the synergistic effect of TiO2 and Pt, the CuO/TiO2/Pt photocathode in photoelectrochemical water splitting exhibits a photocurrent density of −0.75 mA cm−2 at −0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl and a photocorrosion stability of 84% after the stability test for 2 h. This work not only reveals the photocorrosion mechanism of the CuO photocathode, but also offers a new method for improving the photocorrosion stability of photocathodes.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen energy, as a kind of clean energy, is regarded as one of the most ideal alternative energy resources to solve the energy shortage issues and environmental pollution due to its high combustion value, high efficiency and environmental friendliness.1,2 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting will be a promising method to obtain hydrogen on a large scale in the future.3,4 Since photo-induced hydrogen generation on a TiO2 single crystal photoelectrode has been discovered by professor Fujishima and Honda in 1972,5 a growing number of new visible-light response photocatalysts (such as ZnO,6,7 WO3,8 Fe2O3,9,10 BiVO4,11,12 CuInS2,13 Cu2O,14 CuO,15 SnS16 and ZnIn2S417,18) have been widely studied to effectively utilize sunlight for hydrogen production. Among these, cupric oxide (CuO) is one of the most attractive materials for PEC water splitting. CuO is a narrow bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap ranging from 1.3 eV to 1.7 eV according to the preparation method,19–22 which enables it to harvest a large proportion of the solar spectrum. Apart from this, its advantageous properties, such as low cost, abundant storage in the Earth's crust and a facile fabrication process, make CuO an ideal photocathode candidate in PEC water splitting. For instance, Chiang et al. have prepared CuO nanostructures with different morphologies by spin-coating, which show a solar conversion efficiency of 0.91%.23 Masudy-Panah et al. have achieved a high photoconversion efficiency of 3.1% with CuO films by means of radio-frequency magnetron sputtering.24
However, the main shortcoming of the CuO photocathode is its instability in aqueous solution under light irradiation conditions; in other words, the photocurrent density will decrease promptly with the increase of the illumination time. For practical applications, many methods have been reported to improve the photocorrosion stability of CuO photocathodes. As some typical examples, Masudy-Panah et al. found that tuning the crystallinity and surface morphology of CuO films by rapid thermal treatment significantly boosted its stability and photocurrent.25 Tang and his co-workers constructed Ti-alloyed CuO/CuO bilayer films, which showed improved stability and barely caused obvious reduction of the photoresponse.26 Cots et al. reported that the improved stability of a CuO/CuFe2O4 photocathode was achieved by incorporation of iron and then thermal treatment for promoting the external conversion of CuO into CuFe2O4.27 Shaislamov and his groups demonstrated that the prepared CuO/ZnO nanorod/nanobranch photocathode showed 82.13% better stability than a bare CuO photocathode because the growth of high density ZnO NR branches could protect the CuO NR trunk from direct contact with the electrolyte.28
Although these reports have proposed measures to improve the stability of the CuO photocathode, the photocorrosion mechanism needs further study. In this paper, we analyze in detail the mechanism of the photocorrosion of the CuO photocathode, and demonstrate that the photocorrosion is mainly due to the accumulation of photo-induced electrons in the CuO photocathode, leading to the self-reduction of CuO to Cu2O. Therefore, constructing a heterojunction with TiO2 is expected to accelerate the exportation of photo-induced electrons in the CuO photocathode, resulting in enhanced photocorrosion stability of the CuO photocathode. On this basis, the CuO/TiO2 photocathode decorated with a Pt cocatalyst exhibits further improved photocorrosion stability and remarkably boosts the photoelectrochemical properties. This work provides new insight for improving the photocorrosion stability of photocathodes by the combination of a heterojunction and cocatalyst which promotes the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of CuO photocathodes
CuO photocathodes were prepared by the electrodeposition method. Before the electrodeposition, the ITO substrates were sequentially cleaned with acetone, isopropanol and ethanol for 15 min in turns. Firstly, Cu2O films were electrodeposited in a traditional cell system with three electrodes. In detail, 0.48 M CuSO4·5H2O and 3 M lactic acid were dissolved in deionized water and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 10. The Cu2O films were deposited at a potential of −0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 20 min and the temperature of the bath was maintained at 35 °C. Then the resulting samples were washed with deionized water several times and dried in air. Finally, the CuO photocathodes were obtained after annealing at 500 °C in air for 1 h. The following chemical reactions could take place:29 Cu[C3H6O3]2 + e− → Cu[C3H6O3] + [C3H5O3]−(1) 2Cu[C3H6O3]2 + 2OH− → Cu2O + H2O + 2[C3H5O3]−(2) Cu2O → CuO (annealing)(3)
2.2 Preparation of a CuO/TiO2 heterojunction
TiO2 overlayers were obtained by a dip-coating method. Typically, the precursor solution was prepared by the following steps: tetrabutyl titanate was dissolved in 50 ml absolute ethanol and then diethanolamine was added into the solution with vigorous stirring until the solution became homogeneous and transparent. The resulting solution served as the precursor solution. Subsequently, the as-prepared CuO photocathodes were immersed in the TiO2 precursor solution at a speed of 1 mm s−1 and then dried at 60 °C. Finally, the CuO photocathodes coated with the TiO2 sol were annealed at 500 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 for 1 h to obtain the CuO/TiO2 heterojunction.
2.3 Preparation of CuO/Pt and CuO/TiO2/Pt photocathodes
The Pt cocatalyst was deposited on the surface of CuO and CuO/TiO2 photocathodes using the electrochemical deposition method, respectively. Briefly, the CuO and CuO/TiO2 photocathodes were immersed in 0.5 mM H2PtCl6 electrolyte, and the deposition potential of −0.35 V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied to the electrode for 2 min without illumination.
2.4 Characterization
The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI S-4800I) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100). The UV-Vis absorption spectra were obtained by using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (UV-Vis, DU-8B). The crystal structures of the samples were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku-D/max-2500, Cu Kα radiation, 40 kV, 150 mA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI system with an Al-Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV). The surface photovoltage (SPV) measurements were performed using a surface photovoltage spectrometer (PL-SPS/IPCE1000). Monochromatic light was provided by a 500 W xenon lamp and a monochromator. The PEC performances of the samples were examined in a three-electrode configuration. 1 M KOH aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. In the three-electrode system, all as-prepared samples were used as the working electrode. The Ag/AgCl electrode (with saturated KCl) and Pt plate were used as reference and counter electrodes, respectively.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared Cu2O and CuO films. Apart from the peaks assigned to the ITO substrate (JCPDS No. 71-2195), the diffraction peaks of the (110), (111) and (200) planes at around 29.7°, 36.8° and 42.6° correspond to the cubic Cu2O crystal phase (JCPDS No. 03-0898). After annealing, the diffraction peaks attributed to Cu2O disappear, and are replaced by pristine CuO peaks (JCPDS No. 80-1917) corresponding to the (002), (200), (020), (13), (022), (113) and (004) planes at 35.5°, 38.9°, 53.4°, 61.5°, 65.7°, 68.0° and 75.0°, respectively. It is revealed that Cu2O is transformed into CuO completely because no impurities such as Cu2O and metallic Cu are detected. Fig. 2 presents surface views of the CuO photocathode, and it can be found that the smooth nanoparticles are orderly arranged on the substrate with approximately 890 nm of film thickness.

The optical absorption properties of the CuO photocathode are investigated using UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra shown in Fig. 3a. The sample displays a distinct absorption edge of around 885 nm. Then, the optical energy bandgap of the CuO photocathode is determined using a plot of the Tauc formula:30 (αhν)n = A(hν − Eg)(4)where α represents the absorption coefficient, hν represents the photon energy, A represents the intrinsic constant of the material, Eg is the optical bandgap of the material, and n is taken as 2 because CuO has a direct allowed transition. Extrapolation of the Tauc plot of the CuO photocathode gives a bandgap value of 1.40 eV, which is similar to that from a previous report.31

The inset in (a) shows the derived Tauc plots of the samples. 
The effect of the electrodeposition time on the photocurrent is investigated in Fig. S1.† The photocurrent densities of bare CuO deposited by 5 min, 15 min, 20 min and 35 min are −0.39, −0.41, −0.48 and −0.43 mA cm−2 at −0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively, which indicates that the photocurrent density of bare CuO is noticeably improved with an increase in the deposition time and then begins to decay after 20 min deposition. The current density–voltage (J–V) curve of the CuO photocathode (deposition time of 20 min) is shown in Fig. 3b; the CuO photocathode displays a photocurrent density of −0.49 mA cm−2 at −0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which shows the cathodic photocurrent characteristic of a typical p-type semiconductor. An appreciable dark current is observed, which could be attributed to the photoelectrode corrosion. To explore the photoresponse of the CuO photocathode, the transient photocurrent measurement of the photocathode is carried out under chopped illumination (100 mW cm−2) with an interval of 30 s. The photocurrent density rapidly rises and falls when the light turns on and off, indicating that the CuO photocathode has a prominent photoresponse character, as shown in Fig. 3c. As found in many literature reports, there is a dark current of at least 0.1 mA cm−2 in the J–V curve, indicating photocathode corrosion.32–35 To study the stability of the CuO photocathode, the photocorrosion stability test is performed for 2 h under continuous illumination. Fig. 3d shows that the photocurrent density of the CuO photocathode decreases by 69% from the initial photocurrent density (−0.49 mA cm−2) to the final photocurrent density (−0.15 mA cm−2) after the stability test. The decaying photocurrent may be attributed to the self-reduction of CuO caused by photogenerated electrons in the course of the long-time stability test. During this process, the following reaction will occur: 2CuO + H2O + 2e− → Cu2O + 2OH−(5)
Hence, to explore the transformation of CuO, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out before and after PEC stability measurement (Fig. 4). Interestingly, after the stability test, fresh diffraction peaks are observed at 2θ values of 36.4°, 42.3° and 73.6°, corresponding to the (111), (200) and (311) planes of cubic phase Cu2O (JCPSD No. 78-2076), respectively. This definitely indicates the partial reduction of CuO to Cu2O. Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to further study the composition and element valence state of the CuO photocathode before and after the PEC stability test. Fig. 5a shows that the sample surface contains elements Cu, O and C. Among them, the C element is the benchmark for correcting the binding energy of the XPS peaks. Fig. S2† shows the high resolution XPS spectrum of CuO before PEC stability measurement. It is apparent that two main peaks are displayed at 934.4 and 954.2 eV, corresponding to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Cu2+,24 respectively. Meanwhile, the peaks at 943.8 and 962.5 eV are also consistent with the satellite peaks of CuO. Fig. 5b displays the high resolution XPS spectrum of CuO after PEC stability measurement. In addition to the two peaks belonging to CuO (Fig. 5c), two peaks located at 932.2 and 952.1 eV are detected (Fig. 5d), attributed to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Cu+,36 respectively. Both of the results collected from XRD and XPS measurements prove that the self-reduction of CuO into Cu2O is the main reason to the occurrence of CuO photocathode photocorrosion.

In order to mitigate the photocorrosion of CuO photocathodes, the TiO2 overlayer is loaded as a “protective layer” on the surface of the CuO photocathode. This is mainly because the reduction potential of TiO2 does not fall within its own bandgaps and is more negative than the reduction potential of water. Moreover, it can form a p–n heterojunction with CuO to accelerate the separation and transmission of photo-induced electrons. Similarly, Masudy-Panah et al. have also explored the effect of a TiO2 protective layer on the photocorrosion stability of CuO-based photocathodes and found that the sputtering power of TiO2 could significantly affect the photocorrosion stability of the CuO-based photocathode.37 In our work, a simpler and cheaper sol–gel method is adopted to protect the CuO photocathode. More importantly, the protection mechanism of TiO2 on the CuO photocathode is studied in detail. To confirm the existence of the TiO2 overlayer, the TiO2-modified CuO photocathode was analyzed by XRD and XPS. According to the XRD pattern of the CuO/TiO2 photocathode (Fig. S3(a)†), two additional reflection peaks at 2θ = 25.7° and 48.8° correspond to the (101) and (200) planes of anatase phase TiO2 (JCPDS No. 75-1537). Fig. S3(b)† shows the high resolution XPS spectrum of Ti 2p binding energy. There are two peaks at binding energies of 458.4 eV and 463.8 eV, which correspond to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Ti4+, respectively, indicating that titanium exists as TiO2. These results clearly suggest that the CuO/TiO2 composite photocathode has been successfully prepared.
To explore the role of TiO2 on the surface of CuO, some tests related to PEC performance were investigated as follows. In Fig. S4,† the absorption edge of the CuO/TiO2 photocathode is around 880 nm and its bandgap is 1.41 eV (from inset photograph), indicating that no additional bandgap transition is induced. As shown in Fig. 6a, the CuO/TiO2 photocathode displays a higher initial photocurrent density (−0.54 mA cm−2 at −0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl) than the unmodified CuO photocathode. Fig. 6b shows that the photocorrosion stability of the CuO/TiO2 photocathode is noticeably improved. After the stability test, the CuO/TiO2 photocathode retains 63% of its initial photocurrent, which is 32% improved compared with the bare CuO photocathode.

Subsequently, the XRD patterns of CuO and CuO/TiO2 photocathodes before and after the stability test are shown in Fig. 7. After the stability test, the additional XRD diffraction peaks of Cu2O at 36.4°, 42.3° and 73.6° are observed for the CuO/TiO2 photocathode. It should be pointed out that the intensity of these diffraction peaks is considerably reduced, which indicates that the self-reduction of CuO is suppressed. Such a phenomenon can be ascribed to the modification of the TiO2 layer, which forms a p–n heterojunction with the CuO photocathode, facilitating the extraction of photogenerated electrons under the internal electric field at the CuO/TiO2 heterojunction. To gain a deeper insight into the role of the TiO2 layer, the surface photovoltage (SPV) spectra of CuO and CuO/TiO2 photocathodes were obtained with front side illumination. As shown in Fig. 8a, the samples show the typical negative SPV response and the CuO/TiO2 photocathode displays a stronger SPV signal compared to the pure CuO photocathode. To the best of our knowledge, the SPV signals are proportional to the separation and transport of photo-induced carriers. Therefore, these stronger SPV signals indicate higher photogenerated carrier separation efficiency driven by the internal electric field between p-CuO and n-TiO2, which confirms the above explanation doubtlessly. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to further analyze the reaction kinetics and charge transfer at the interface of the electrode/electrolyte, as shown in Fig. 8b. It can be seen that the semicircular shapes of the Nyquist curves are derived from the photogenerated carrier transfer between CuO and the electrolyte, and the arc radius is related to the charge transfer resistance. Obviously, the arc radius of the CuO/TiO2 photocathode is smaller than that of the bare CuO photocathode, indicating that photo-induced electrons are more easily transferred from the CuO surface to the electrolyte solution, thereby reducing the accumulation of photogenerated electrons.

Given the results above, a schematic illustration of the charge separation process at the CuO/TiO2 photocathode is proposed in Fig. 8c. Under illumination, the electrons of CuO and TiO2 are both excited from the valence band (VB) into the conduction band (CB). Since CuO itself cannot promptly transfer photogenerated electrons into the electrolyte solution, the photogenerated electrons on its surface will accumulate gradually, leading to the self-reduction of CuO. However, with the introduction of the TiO2 layer, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of CuO easily migrate to the CB of TiO2 and the holes in the VB of TiO2 transfer to the VB of CuO due to their favorable level gradient. Moreover, the internal electric field further promotes the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers in this direction, resulting in an improved photocurrent and stability of the CuO photocathode.
Apart from the above method, we also decorate the CuO photocathode with the Pt cocatalyst to prevent the photocorrosion of CuO, which acts as an electron capture layer. Fig. S5(a)† shows an SEM image of the CuO/Pt photocathode under the electro-deposition process. It can be clearly seen that Pt nanoparticles (NPs) with a diameter of 20–50 nm are uniformly covered on the surface of the CuO photocathode. Fig. S5(b)† shows the corresponding element distribution mapping, which proves the existence of the Pt element. To analyze the effect of Pt NPs on the crystalline phase of CuO itself, XRD was performed. In Fig. S6(a),† no additional diffraction peaks are observed after deposition of Pt NPs compared with those of bare CuO. In particular, the intensity of the diffraction peak located at 38.9° is stronger than that of a single CuO photocathode, which corresponds to the (111) plane of Pt matched with JCPDS No. 87-0644. In Fig. S6(b),† the absorbance of the CuO/Pt photocathode is significantly improved, due to the enhanced light trapping by the increased specific surface area. J–V curves were recorded to explore the impact of Pt NPs on the CuO photocathode (Fig. 9a). A photocurrent density of −0.57 mA cm−2 at −0.55 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) is obtained from the CuO/Pt photocathode, which demonstrates an increased photocurrent value compared to that of the pure CuO photocathode. As shown in Fig. 9b, the CuO/Pt photocathode displays a superior photocorrosion stability of 70%, which is a 39% improvement compared to the bare CuO photocathode.
 Fig. 9  Photocurrent density–voltage curves (a), and photocurrent density–time curves measured in a 1 M NaOH electrolyte at −0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl under simulated sunlight illumination of CuO and CuO/Pt for 2 h (b). 
To study the reasons for the aforementioned results, the XRD patterns of pure CuO and Pt-modified CuO photocathodes before and after the stability test were recorded and are shown in Fig. 10. After the stability test, the CuO/Pt photocathode also shows an additional diffraction peak at 36.4° corresponding to Cu2O. Differently, the intensity of this diffraction peak is remarkably lower than that of the pure CuO photocathode, indicating that the Pt layer hinders the self-reduction of CuO due to its fast electron trapping property. To further investigate the effect of the Pt layer, the SPV measurement of CuO and CuO/Pt photocathodes was performed and the results are presented in Fig. 11a. It is clearly seen that the SPV signal of the CuO/Pt photocathode is 2 times stronger than that of the pure CuO photocathode, indicating the accumulation of excess photogenerated electrons on the CuO/Pt photocathode surface. This further proves that the Pt layer acts as an ECL, facilitating the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers. To further study the carrier transfer and recombination processes at the CuO/Pt photocathode, EIS measurement was performed and results are given in Fig. 11b. Obviously, the arc radius of the CuO/Pt photocathode is smaller than that of the pristine CuO photocathode, indicating that the photo-induced electrons transfer from the semiconductor to electrolyte more easily, thereby suppressing the photocorrosion of the CuO photocathode.

To further understand the charge transfer process at the CuO/Pt photocathode, a schematic diagram is presented in Fig. 11c. It has been reported that the work functions of CuO (5.3 eV) are lower than those of Pt (5.65 eV);38 so the electrons of CuO can be trapped by Pt. When Pt nanoparticles deposit on the surface of the CuO photocathode, electrons will transfer from CuO to Pt until thermodynamic equilibrium is established, forming an inner electric field between CuO and Pt. When the CuO/Pt photocathode is irradiated with visible light, the photo-induced electrons readily transfer from CuO to Pt and then to the electrolyte with the help of the inner electric field. The reduced electron accumulation at the CuO surface thus results in such an increase in photocorrosion stability for the CuO/Pt photocathode.
Based on the above experimental results, we found that both TiO2 and Pt promote the photocorrosion stability of the original CuO photocathode to some extent. So how does it affect the stability when these two strategies are combined together on the CuO photocathode?
Firstly, the micromorphology of the CuO/TiO2/Pt photocathode was detected by SEM and TEM, as shown in Fig. 12. It can be observed that the surface morphology of the CuO/TiO2/Pt photocathode is similar to that of the CuO/Pt photocathode (Fig. 12a). Fig. 12b shows the high resolution electron microscopy (TEM) images of a CuO/TiO2/Pt nanofilm, from which the lattice fringes can be clearly distinguished. The corresponding lattice spacing values are 0.232 nm, 0.253 nm and 0.346 nm, which are indexed to the (111) plane of Pt, the (002) plane of CuO and the (111) plane of TiO2, respectively. Furthermore, the element distribution is quantitatively analyzed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The element distribution mapping shows the corresponding element distribution of Cu, O, Ti and Pt of the CuO/TiO2/Pt composite electrode as seen in Fig. 12c. Based on the above analysis, it is found that the CuO/TiO2/Pt photocathode is successfully prepared.

J–V curves were collected to explore the synergistic effect of Pt and TiO2 on the CuO photocathode. As presented in Fig. 13a, a photocurrent density of −0.75 mA cm−2 at −0.55 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) is achieved from the CuO/TiO2/Pt photocathode, which is greatly improved compared with those of CuO/TiO2 (−0.54 mA cm−2) and CuO/Pt (−0.57 mA cm−2). As seen in Fig. 13b, the photocurrent densities of CuO, CuO/TiO2, CuO/Pt and CuO/TiO2/Pt photocathodes decrease and increase rapidly at the beginning and end of chopped illumination, which indicates that the photocathodes have prominent photocurrent responses. Meanwhile, the photocurrent density curve of the CuO/TiO2/Pt photocathode shows almost no sharp peak, indicating that the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs is further inhibited. For the CuO/TiO2/Pt photocathode, only a 14% decrement in the initial photocurrent density is measured after the stability test (Fig. 13c), which indicates that the photocorrosion stability of the CuO/TiO2/Pt photocathode is better than those of CuO/TiO2 and CuO/Pt photocathodes.

Subsequently, XRD patterns were recorded to illustrate the influence of both TiO2 and Pt on the CuO photocathode. In Fig. S7,† it can be seen that there is almost no diffraction peak of Cu2O in the CuO/TiO2/Pt photocathode after the stability test, indicating that the self-reduction of CuO is greatly inhibited after decoration with TiO2 and Pt. XPS was conducted to accurately investigate the chemical composition of the CuO/TiO2/Pt photocathode after the stability test. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Cu 2p binding energy is shown in Fig. S8(a),† revealing the difference of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks for CuO and CuO/TiO2/Pt photocathodes. Fig. S8(b) and (c)† show the high-resolution deconvolution XPS results for Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2, respectively. The area ratios of Cu+versus Cu2+ 2p1/2 peaks in Fig. S8(b)† and Cu+versus Cu2+ 2p3/2 in Fig. S8(c)† are calculated to be 0.882 and 0.554, respectively. In contrast to the area ratio of the bare CuO photocathode after the PEC stability test (1.093:0.803), the two proportions are obviously reduced. It is further proved that the self-reduction of CuO is greatly hindered, leading to the enhanced photocorrosion stability.
The enhanced photocorrosion stability could be attributed to the improved charge separation efficiency with the synergy of the CuO/TiO2 heterojunction and Pt cocatalyst. This synergistic effect is well supported by SPV and EIS measurements. As shown in Fig. 13d, the CuO/TiO2/Pt photocathode shows an enhanced SPV signal compared to those of CuO/TiO2 and CuO/Pt photocathodes. The formation of the p–n junction between CuO and TiO2 promotes the transfer of photogenerated electrons to TiO2. More importantly, the Pt layer acts as an ECL, so that the separated electrons can be rapidly transferred to the outermost surface of the CuO/TiO2/Pt photocathode for PEC water reduction. This process expedites the extraction of photogenerated electrons in the CuO photocathode which hinders the self-reduction of the CuO electrode. The EIS measurements of CuO, CuO/TiO2, CuO/Pt and CuO/TiO2/Pt photocathodes are given in Fig. S9.† The CuO/TiO2/Pt photocathode exhibits a much smaller arc radius than those of CuO/TiO2 and CuO/Pt photocathodes, indicating a much lower charge transfer resistance. This phenomenon could be attributed to the favorable synergistic effect of the heterojunction and cocatalyst, resulting in the optimal charge transfer efficiency identified from the above results.
Given the results above, a persuasive mechanism of internal charge separation and transfer processes at the CuO/TiO2/Pt photocathode is presented in Fig. S10.† Under light illumination, CuO and TiO2 are excited to generate the electron–hole pairs. Moreover, the CB level and VB level of TiO2 are more positive than the corresponding bands of CuO. Therefore, this favorable band alignment supports the efficient transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CB of CuO to that of TiO2 along the band bending direction. Subsequently, electrons can be promptly trapped by the electron collector Pt layer. Overall, this efficient charge transfer could reduce the accumulation of photogenerated electrons, which in return decrease electron-induced CuO self-reductive corrosion.
4. Conclusion
In summary, this work confirms that the self-reduction of the CuO photocathode caused by photogenerated electrons is the foremost reason for photocorrosion in PEC water splitting. To retard this defect, TiO2 and Pt are deposited on CuO to form a ternary CuO/TiO2/Pt composite photoelectrode, in which TiO2 combined with CuO establish a well-aligned bandgap and built-in potential, facilitating the transfer of photogenerated electrons in the CuO photocathode, and the Pt cocatalyst as an electron capture layer (ECL) loaded on the surface of the CuO/TiO2 photocathode further promotes the extraction of photogenerated electrons in CuO. The accumulation of photogenerated electrons in the bulk of CuO is significantly reduced by the collaborative effect of TiO2 and the Pt cocatalyst, which relieves the self-reduction of the CuO photocathode undoubtedly. Concretely, the CuO/TiO2/Pt photocathode displays a higher photocurrent density (−0.75 mA cm−2 at −0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and photocorrosion stability of 84% over 2 h. The present work provides a promising method for improving the stability of photocathode materials caused by self-redox reactions.
