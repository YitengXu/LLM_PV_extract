    , Accepted 21st February 2022First published on 25th February 2022AbstractIn the present investigation, different concentrations of Dy3+,Eu3+ doped and co-doped La(PO4) phosphors were synthesized via the solid-state synthesis route. Furthermore, their structural, morphological, vibrational features, thermal stability, spectroscopic behavior, energy transfer mechanism, photometric results, I–V characteristics and spectral response in solar cells were investigated in detail. The XRD pattern of the synthesized phosphor confirmed the successful preparation of Dy3+,Eu3+ doped and co-doped La(PO4) phosphors. Using their XRD data, Rietveld refinement was performed and structural behavior was studied. Dy3+ activated La(PO4) phosphors exhibit blue (482 nm) and yellow (571 nm) emission under different UV and blue excitations (350 nm, 364 nm, 388 nm and 454 nm). Whereas, Eu3+ activated La(PO4) phosphors show emission in the orange (593 nm) and red (618 nm) region. In this investigation, excitation spectra of Eu3+ and emission spectra of Dy3+ overlapped each other. On the basis of spectral overlapping, energy transfer behavior was investigated. The synthesized co-doped phosphors show blue and yellow emissions with some red emission. Further, the synthesized co-doped phosphors were coated on solar cells and their I–V characteristics were investigated. The I–V characteristics and spectral response of the solar cell suggested that our synthesized phosphors may be useful for enhancing solar cell efficiency. The color tunable features also suggested that synthesized phosphors have good potential for white LED applications.
1. Introduction
In the modern era, white LEDs (WLEDs) have attracted tremendous research attention in the lighting industry because of their amazing features like high energy efficiency, long operation lifetime, low power consumption, compact size and environmental friendliness etc.1–4 In the past two decades, much effort has been devoted to the investigation of novel inorganic rare earth activated materials and the fabrication of WLEDs. The widespread popularity of WLEDs has proved that they will be the most widely used light source in upcoming years. WLEDs can be used in vehicle headlights, digital displays, road lights, automotive displays, liquid crystal devices, public and residential lighting systems etc.5–7 The role of luminescent materials is important in the development of lighting devices, and they show great potential for high-performance display applications such as with WLEDs.
According to the literature, currently two approaches are used for manufacturing WLEDs. The first is the RGB approach, in which red, green and blue LED lights are mixed separately in a fixed ratio to obtain white light. In the second approach, ultra-violet (UV) or near ultra-violet (NUV), or a blue LED chip is combined with single (yellow) or multi-color phosphors.8,9 Currently, the blue LED chip-coated yellow phosphor is used in commercial white LEDs, which is known as cerium doped yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG:Ce3+) phosphor.10,11 However, this approach has several drawbacks such as a poor rendering index (CRI < 80), has a high color correlated temperature (CCT > 4500 K) and absence of red color.10,11 This problem may be solved using NUV excited multi color phosphors. In this regard, it is important to develop a single-phase phosphor for multicolor emission UV/NUV WLEDs. This type of fabricated WLED has several advantages like excellent color rendering index, high color quality, better reproducibility, improved chromatic stability, a simplified fabrication process, and a competitive price.12,13 By co-doping a different sensitizer and activator in the single host material, light can be achieved by energy transfer from the sensitizer to the activator ion. As per the literature, up to now a number of multi-color phosphors have been investigated using this approach. Guo et al. investigated SrLaMgTaO6:Dy3+/Eu3+ phosphors and obtained blue, yellow and red emission.13 Li et al. reported Tb3+–Eu3+ co-doped LiBaB9O15 phosphors.14 Xie et al. reported the energy transfer mechanism between Eu2+ → Tb3+ → Eu3+ in Ca6La2Na2(PO4)6F2 phosphors.15 Similarly, several other multi-color emitting phosphors have been developed and show applicability for WLEDs.
The previous investigations and literature suggest that Dy3+ is the most widely used trivalent rare-earth ion because of its unique luminescence characteristics, which are useful for the development of WLEDs.16 The Dy3+ activated host materials exhibit two strong emission bands in the blue color region around 482 nm due to the 4F9/2 → 6H15/2 transition, and the yellow color region around 572 nm due to the 4F9/2 → 6H13/2 transition.17–19 According to the literature, some Dy3+ activated materials show weak red emission around 670 nm due to the 4F9/2 → 6H13/2 transition.20 Due to the absence or a weak red color emission, Dy3+ activated materials show a very poor color rendering index. To solve this problem, Eu3+ ions can be co-doped in the host material in the presence of the Dy3+ ion. Eu3+ activated materials are the most suitable for obtaining orange–red emission. Eu3+ doped materials show orange–red emission around 593 nm and 618 nm due to 5D0 → 7F1,2 transitions.21–23 In recent years, several Dy3+ and Eu3+ co-doped phosphors have been examined for use in WLEDs and they have had positive results for manufacturing of WLEDs. Recently, Wu et al. reported LiLaSiO4:Dy3+,Eu3+ phosphors for white LEDs.24 Wang et al. studied K2CaP2O7:Dy3+,Eu3+ phosphors for WLEDs.25 Wang et al. studied Y2Mg3Ge3O12:Dy3+/Eu3+ phosphors and reported that the synthesized phosphor is suitable for solid state lighting.26
In addition, host selection is also an important aspect for the co-doping of Eu3+ and Dy3+ ions. As per the literature, phosphate is a suitable host for doping with rare earth ions. Phosphate based host materials show excellent benefits, like low synthesis temperature, high chemical and thermal stability, high light efficiency, easy fabrication and low fabrication cost etc.6,16,25,27,28 In this investigation, we have synthesized Eu3+, Dy3+ doped and co-doped La(PO4) phosphors. The obtained results of this investigation revealed color tunable luminescence by varying the concentration of Eu3+ ions. Furthermore, the synthesized phosphors were coated on a Si-solar cell and we examined their I–V characteristics in the presence of direct sunlight and under a solar simulator. The obtained results revealed that solar cell efficiency was enhanced around 17.34% under direct sunlight and around 12.76% under the solar simulator. According to our results we have concluded that Eu3+,Dy3+ co-doped La(PO4) phosphors are candidate materials for WLEDs and solar applications.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis method
In this investigation, a series of Eu3+,Dy3+ doped and co-doped La(PO4) phosphors were successfully synthesized by a solid state reaction method. In this method, we have used lanthanum oxide (La2O3), diammonium hydrogen phosphate [(NH4)2HPO4], europium oxide (Eu2O3) and dysprosium oxide (Dy2O3) as starting materials. All these raw materials were purchased from Loba Chemie with AR grade and high purity. The required raw materials were weighed in stoichiometric amounts using an electronic weighing balance. After that the weighed samples were mixed together using an agate motor for 30 min. Then, the mixture was placed in the silica crucibles and heated through a muffle furnace at around 800 °C for 24 hours and then cooled to room temperature.
2.2 Coating the solar cell
In this investigation, coating of the synthesized material was done using the doctor blade method. To coat the solar cell, ethanol, terpineol, ethyl cellulose and acetic acid were used with the synthesized phosphor. We coated the synthesized phosphor on the surface of a commercial solar cell on an area of 80 mm. The detailed synthesis process and further information have been reported by Kadam and Dhoble.29
2.3 Characterization techniques and instrument details
The XRD patterns of the synthesized phosphors were recorded using a Rigaku miniflex d 600 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154056 nm). The XRD pattern was measured in the range 10 to 60° with a step size of 0.02°. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and elemental composition of the synthesized La(PO4) material was taken using a JSM-6360LV scanning electron microscope (JEOL, USA). The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum of the synthesized phosphors were measured using a Brucker Alpha FT-IR spectrometer. The thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) was carried out using a Shimadzu DTG-60 simultaneous DTATG apparatus. The photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu RF5301PC spectrofluorophotometer with a Xenon flash lamp (150 W). The PL emission and excitation spectra were recorded using a spectral slit width of 1.5 nm and the excitation source used was a xenon lamp. The photometric results were measured using the OSRAM SYLVANIA color calculator. All these characterizations were done at room temperature. I–V characteristics of the synthesized phosphor-coated solar cell and blank solar cell were measured using a jet spin solar simulator or under direct sunlight at around 40 °C.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 XRD pattern and Rietveld refinement
The phase purity of the samples was checked for dopants using powder XRD. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of La(PO4):Eu3+, La(PO4):Dy3+, La(PO4):Dy3+,Eu3+ phosphors. From the XRD patterns of the given samples, it is very clear that the synthesized phosphors have been successfully prepared. All the diffraction peaks correspond well with the available JCPDS data (card number-32-0493) of La(PO4). No additional phase was observed after the doping of Eu3+ and Dy3+ ions, but a small change was observed in the XRD pattern of La(PO4):Dy3+,Eu3+ phosphor, which is possibly due to doping with higher amounts of Dy3+ and Eu3+. According to the literature, it was found that the ionic radius of La3+ is 1.21 Å, and the ionic radius of Eu3+, Dy3+ is 1.07 Å, 0.912 Å, respectively. Therefore for La(PO4), it is highly probable that Eu3+ and Dy3+ ions occupy the Ca2+ site according to their nearest ionic radii.16,30Fig. 2 depicts the Rietveld refinement of the experimentally obtained XRD pattern of La(PO4) phosphor using the FullProf program. The pseudo-Voigt peak profile function was used to perform the Rietveld refinement. In the process of refinement, the initial parameters are taken from CIF file no. 1525730, which is available in the crystallographic open database, reported by Callejas et al.31 In Fig. 2, the black stars (*) represent the experimentally observed values, the calculated values are represented by the red solid line, the difference between the observed and calculated values is represented by the blue solid line, and Bragg's reflection is represented by the vertical lines. The calculated factors through Rietveld refinement are Rp = 17.1, Rwp = 20.6, Rexp = 14.80 and χ2 = 3.685.

3.3 Morphology and elemental composition
The particle size and morphological behavior of our synthesized phosphor (LaPO4) were examined using SEM. As per the literature, it is well known that luminescence properties of phosphors depend on the particle size, shape and crystallinity. Fig. 4 shows SEM images of the synthesized LaPO4 phosphor. The SEM images clearly reveal that the shapes and sizes of particles are not uniform. The shapes and sizes are irregular, which is possibly because the proposed phosphor is synthesized at high temperature around 800 °C. The particle size of the proposed phosphor is 0.5 to 2 μm, which is calculated using ImageJ software. The size of the particles affects the physical properties and behavior of the material. The microsized particles enhance the photoluminescence (PL) properties of the phosphor and the microsized material is suitable for the manufacture of LEDs.8Fig. 5 shows the EDX spectrum and a table of quantities of the constituent elements. The EDX image confirmed that all the constituent elements were present in the synthesized LaPO4 phosphor.

3.4 FT-IR study
The FT-IR spectra of the La(PO4):Eu3+, La(PO4):Dy3+, La(PO4):Dy3+,Eu3+ phosphors were recorded using a Brucker Alpha FT-IR spectrometer in the range 4000 cm−1 to 500 cm−1, as shown in Fig. 6. From the FT-IR spectrum, it is very clear that all samples have similar FT-IR spectra. The FT-IR spectra revealed several bands in the range 1350 to 500 cm−1. The absorption bands in the range of 1350 to 640 cm−1 arise due to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration (v1 and v3) of the PO4 tetrahedron, whereas the absorption bands in the range 640 cm−1 to 460 cm−1 arise due to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration (v2 and v4) of the PO4 group.32,33 These spectra also show that with the variation of rare earth ions or the co-doping of rare earth ions, the FT-IR spectra do not change, they are similar to each other. This means that there was no change in the crystal structure, as confirmed by the XRD pattern.

3.5 Thermal behavior
The thermal stability of the synthesized undoped LaPO4 phosphor was analyzed using TG/DTA. Fig. 7 shows the TG/DTA curves of the proposed sample, measured in the range 25 °C to 800 °C. The DTA curve reveals two endothermic bands around 50 °C and 208 °C due to evaporation of moisture and removal of CO2, NH3 gases. The TG curve shows weight loss (∼3%) at 50 °C. The observed total weight loss is about 4% in the range 25 °C to 800 °C. This demonstrates the excellent stability of the proposed sample.

3.6 DRS spectra and band gap measurements

Fig. 8 shows the UV diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS) of the synthesized La(PO4) phosphor. The DRS spectrum is recorded in the range 200 nm to 800 nm at room temperature. The DRS spectra of the synthesized phosphor shows a weak absorption band compared to the DRS spectrum recorded for the undoped host material. The band-gap of the La(PO4) phosphor was investigated using the DRS spectra and Kubelka–Munk equation. The DRS data was converted into an absorption spectrum using the following relation:34,35  where R, K and S are the reflection, absorption and scattering coefficient, respectively. The relationship between the linear absorption coefficient (α) and the energy gap (Eg) of the sample is proposed by the Tauc equation, as given below:34,35ℏυ = C1 (ℏυ − Eg)n/2where, ℏυ is the photon energy, C1 is the proportionality constant, Eg is the value of the band gap, and n is the nature of the transition. Here, n = 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 for allowed direct transitions, non-metallic materials, direct forbidden transitions, indirect allowed transitions and direct forbidden transitions, respectively. The calculated value of the band gap is Eg = 4.12 eV.

3.7 Photoluminescence (PL) properties

3.7.1 Dy3+ activated La(PO4). 

Fig. 9 shows the PL excitation spectra of La(1−x)(PO4):xDy3+ (x = 1 mol%) phosphors monitored at 571 nm emission wavelength. The given PL excitation spectra were recorded in the range 300 nm to 500 nm. The most intense excitation bands are found in the range 350 nm to 480 nm. From Fig. 9, we can clearly see that the excitation spectrum has seven narrow bands around 325 nm, 350 nm, 364 nm, 388 nm, 428 nm, 454 nm and 475 nm. These excitation bands are ascribed due to 6H15/2 → 6P3/2, 6H15/2 → 6P7/2, 6H15/2 → 6P5/2, 6H15/2 → 4I13/2, 6H15/2 → 4G11/2, 6H15/2 → 4I15/2 and 6H15/2 → 4F9/2 transitions of the Dy3+ ions, respectively. The excitation bands at 350 nm, 364 nm and 388 nm match well with NUV excitations; and the excitation bands at 428 nm, 454 nm and 475 nm match well with blue excitation in LED chips, which are suitable excitations for WLEDs. These results suggest that Dy3+ is a suitable activator for white light generation. From the excitation spectra, we see that the 350 nm, 364 nm, 388 nm and 454 nm excitation bands are the most intense bands, so we measured the PL emission spectrum under these excitation wavelengths.
 Fig. 9  PL excitation spectrum of La(1−x)(PO4):xDy3+ (x = 1.0 mol%) phosphor monitored at 571 nm emission wavelength. 
The PL emission spectra of La(1−x)(PO4):xDy3+ (x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mol%) phosphors have been measured under excitation wavelengths 350 nm, 364 nm, 388 nm and 454 nm, as shown in Fig. 10(I–IV). All these emission spectra are similar in nature, and the only variation observed is the intensity. Under the above-mentioned excitation wavelengths, the PL emission spectra were recorded in the range of 400 nm to 650 nm. The measured emission spectra display two intense bands around 482 nm and 571 nm. These emission bands are ascribed to the 4F9/2 → 6H15/2 and 4F9/2 → 6H13/2 transitions of the Dy3+ ions, respectively.36 The literature suggests that the 4F9/2 → 6H15/2 (482 nm) is a magnetic dipole transition and the 4F9/2 → 6H13/2 (571 nm) is an electric dipole transition (hypersensitive transition) with ΔL = 2 and ΔJ = 2, which is related to the host and crystal field of the host matrix.37 It is well known that the magnetic dipole transition is more prominent than the electric dipole transition if the Dy3+ ions are situated in high symmetry with an inversion center.36 If the electric dipole transition is more prominent than the magnetic dipole transition, then the Dy3+ ions are situated in low symmetry sites with no inversion center.36 In this investigation, it is noted that the electric dipole transition is more prominent, therefore the Dy3+ ions are situated in a low symmetry site with no inversion center of the host matrix.37
 Fig. 10  PL emission spectra of La(1−x)(PO4):xDy3+ (x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 mol%) phosphors monitored at (I) 350 nm, (II) 364 nm, (III) 388 nm, (IV) 454 nm, excitation wavelengths (insert images: concentration quenching curve). 
In addition, the phase deformation around the Dy3+ ions in the synthesized La(PO4) phosphor can be found using the integrated intensity ratio between the 4F9/2 → 6H13/2 (yellow) and 4F9/2 → 6H15/2 (blue) transitions. In this investigation – under 350 nm, 364 nm and 388 nm excitation – the integrated intensity ratio 4F9/2 → 6H13/2/F9/2 → 6H15/2 (Y/B) is found to be 1.09 or 1.13 for La(PO4):1 mol% Dy3+, as shown in Table 2. The obtained results of Y/B also suggest that mostly the Dy3+ ions occupy low symmetry sites with no inversion center.

The insert images in Fig. 10(I–IV) show the variation in emission intensity with concentration of Dy3+ ions. The plotted graphs show that the emission intensity increased with increasing Dy3+ concentration up to 1 mol%, after that a decrease in emission intensity was noticed, this may be due to the concentration quenching mechanism of luminescence. In the concentration quenching mechanism, the emission intensity suddenly decreases with increasing rare earth ions. The main reason for concentration quenching is the short distance between the rare earth ions; with a higher amount of rare earth ions, the distance between them decreases. Therefore they do not contribute to any additional luminescence and the emission intensity decreases.
Based on Blasse's proposal, the critical distance (Rc) between the Dy3+ ions was calculated using the following equation:38 (1)Where, V = volume of a unit cell, Xc = critical concentration of Dy3+ ions, and N = number of Dy3+ sites in the unit cell.
As per the literature, concentration quenching strongly depends on the critical distance (Rc) between rare earth ions. The interaction between Dy3+–Dy3+ ions can be calculated using the critical distance between Dy3+ ions. The concentration quenching takes place because of an exchange interaction or an electric multipole–multipole interaction. If the value of Rc is greater than 5 Å, then electric multipole–multipole interactions are responsible for the concentration quenching. Whereas, if the value of Rc is less than 5 Å, an exchange interaction is responsible for the concentration quenching.29 In this investigation, the value of V = 303.938, Xc = 1 mol% (0.01) and N = 4. Using eqn (1), the calculated value of Rc is around 24.38 Å. Therefore, according to the calculated result of Rc, it is clear that electric multipole–multipole interactions are responsible for the concentration quenching.
Dexter proposed a model of energy transfer between similar rare earth ions and this model is explained through an equation that establishes a relationship between the luminescence intensity and the concentration of the doped rare earth ion. The equation proposed by Dexter is given below in eqn (2):39 (2)where, x is the concentration of the doped rare earth ion, k and β are constants, I is the luminescence intensity, θ is the strength of the multipolar interaction. As per the literature, the value of θ is constant and equals 6, 8, or 10. The value of θ = 6, 8, and 10 denotes the dipole–dipole (d–d), dipole–quadrupole (d–q), or quadrupole–quadrupole (q–q) interaction, respectively.39Fig. 11 shows the relation between luminescence intensity and concentration of Dy3+ ions for different excitations. Fig. 11 reveals a negative slope value (−θ/3), which is listed in the Table 3. The value of θ for La(PO4):1 mol% Dy3+ phosphor under 350 nm, 364 nm, 388 nm and 454 nm is close to 6. Therefore, it is concluded that the concentration quenching is caused by the energy transfer of dipole–dipole (d–d) interactions in the La(PO4):Dy3+ phosphor.

3.7.2 Eu3+ activated La(PO4). 

Fig. 12 displays PL excitation spectra of La(PO4): 1 mol% Eu3+ phosphor monitored at 618 nm emission wavelength in the range of 315 nm to 550 nm. The recorded excitation spectra shows several excitation bands at 320 nm, 363 nm, 385 nm, 395 nm, 467 nm, 527 nm and 536 nm. These excitation bands are ascribed due to 7F0 → 5H6, 7F0 → 5D4, 5F0 → 5G3, 7F0 → 5L6, 7F0 → 5D2, 7F0 → 5D1 (527 nm and 536 nm) transitions of Eu3+ ions, respectively.40,41 From the excitation spectra, it is clear that 395 nm and 467 nm excitation bands are the dominant bands compared to the other excitations. Note that, excitation bands at 395 nm and 467 nm match well with the excitation of commercial NUV and blue LED chips, which are suitable for WLEDs.
 Fig. 12  PL excitation spectrum of La(1−x)(PO4):xEu3+ (x = 1.0 mol%) phosphor monitored at 618 nm emission wavelength. 
Under 395 nm and 467 nm excitation, the emission spectra of La(1−x)(PO4):xEu3+ (x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mol%) phosphors were recorded in the range 550 nm to 650 nm, as shown in Fig. 13(I and II). The nature of the emission spectra under different excitation and different concentrations of Eu3+ ions are similar. The emission spectra exhibit two strong bands around 593 nm (orange) and 618 nm (red), which arise from the 5D0 → 7F1 and 5D0 → 7F2 transitions of Eu3+ ions, respectively.40,41 It is known that the 5D0 → 7F1 and 5D0 → 7F2 transitions are called magnetic dipole (MD) and electric dipole (ED) transitions, respectively.42 According to previous literature, the 5D0 → 7F1 (MD) transition is independent of the coordination surroundings of the host lattice,42 whereas the 5D0 → 7F2 (ED) transition is highly dependent on the surrounding chemical environment of the dopant (Eu3+).40,41 As shown in Fig. 13(I and II), the emission intensity of the ED transition is more intense than the MD transition; and when the ED transition is dominant, the Eu3+ ions locate in low symmetry sites with no inversion center.

The insert images in Fig. 13(I and II) show the variation in emission intensity with Eu3+ concentration. The insert images reveal that highest emission intensity increases from 0.1 mol% to 1 mol%. After that, with increasing concentration of Eu3+ ions, the emission intensity gradually decreased owing to the obvious concentration quenching effect. The critical distance (Rc) was determined for the La(PO4):Eu3+ phosphor using eqn (1), as discussed in the previous section. The value of Rc is 24.38 Å, which is greater than 5 Å; hence, electric multipolar–multipolar interactions are the cause of the concentration quenching in the proposed La(PO4):Eu3+ phosphor. Fig. 14 displays the relation between the concentration of dopants and emission intensity that is proposed in the Dexter theory under 395 nm and 467 nm, respectively. The calculated value of θ is given in Table 4 for the 593 nm and 618 nm emission bands monitored under 395 nm and 467 nm excitations. The calculated values of θ are close to 6, hence the dipole–dipole integration is the reason for the internal concentration quenching in the La(PO4):Eu3+ phosphor.

3.7.3 Energy transfer mechanism. 
According to the Froster and Dexter theory of energy transfer, spectral overlap is the most important tool for studying the energy transfer mechanism between sensitizer and activator. Fig. 15 shows the spectral overlap between the emission spectrum of Dy3+ ions and the excitation spectrum of Eu3+ ions. According to the Froster and Dexter theory, the absorption or excitation spectra of the activator overlap with the emission spectra of the donor, so there is a possibility to transfer energy from donor to acceptor. From the spectral overlap between the emission spectra of the Dy3+ ion and the excitation spectra of the Eu3+ ion, it can be assumed that energy transfer is possible from Dy3+ to Eu3+.

3.7.4 Eu3+ co-doped La(PO4):Dy3+. 
The PL emission spectra of La1−x−y(PO4):xDy3+,yEu3+ (x = 1.0 mol%, y = 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0 mol%) phosphors has been monitored under 365 nm excitation, which is shown in Fig. 16. According to the PL emission spectra of the Dy3+ activated La(PO4) phosphor, the highest emission intensity of Dy3+ ions was found for 1 mol% concentration. Therefore, we fixed the concentration of Dy3+ ions at 1.0 mol% and varied the amount of Eu3+ ions. Under 365 nm excitation, the PL emission spectra of La1−x−y(PO4):xDy3+,yEu3+ phosphors revealed characteristic emission bands of Dy3+ ions around 482 nm (4F9/2 → 6H15/2) and 571 nm (4F9/2 → 6H13/2); with characteristic emission bands of Eu3+ ions around 593 nm (5D0 →7F1) and 617 nm (5D0 →7F2). From the emission spectra, it can be clearly seen that with increased doping concentration of Eu3+, the emission intensity of Dy3+ decreases and emission intensity of Eu3+ increases. The obtained results suggest that energy transferred from Dy3+ to Eu3+.
 Fig. 16  PL emission spectra of La(1−x−y)(PO4):xDy3+,yEu3+ (x = 1.0; y = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0 mol%) phosphors monitored at 365 nm excitation. 
The energy transfer efficiency (ηT) from Dy3+ to Eu3+ can be determined using the following equation:43 (3)where, Is and Iso are the emission intensity of Dy3+ activated La(PO4) phosphor, with Eu3+ doping and without Eu3+ doping ions, respectively. The calculated value of the energy transfer efficiency increases continuously with the increase in concentration of Eu3+ ions. The value of ηT for 1 mol% Eu3+ ions is about 67%. Fig. 17 shows the variation in the emission intensity of Dy3+ and Eu3+ ions and the variation in energy transfer efficiency with the variation of Eu3+ concentration. Fig. 18 shows the energy level diagram, which shows the energy transfer mechanism from Dy3+ to Eu3+. When synthesized samples were excited by 365 nm wavelength, the electrons of Dy3+ ions in the ground state jump to the excited state 6H15/2 → 6P5/2 and then relax non-radiatively to 4F9/2. The blue emission at 482 nm (4F9/2 → 6H15/2 transition), and yellow emission at 571 nm (4F9/2 → 6H13/2 transition) are then obtained. The energy transfer from Dy3+ to Eu3+, causes the electrons of Eu3+ to populate the 5D2 state and then they rapidly relax non-radiatively to the 5D0 level. The radiative transition from 5D0 to 7F1 and 7F2 result in emissions of 591 nm and 618 nm, respectively.

3.7.5 Photometric characterization. 

Fig. 19 displays the Commision internationale d'éclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates of La1−x−y(PO4):xDy3+,yEu3+ (x =1.0 mol%, y = 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0 mol%) phosphors. The CIE coordinates and color rendering index (CRI) values for the proposed phosphors were determined from the PL emission spectra of the synthesized phosphors using OSRAM SYLVANIA color calculator 1931. The determined values of the CIE coordinates and CRI for the proposed phosphors are presented in the Table 5. From the chromaticity diagram, it can easily be seen that the color coordinates continuously shift in the white/red color region with increasing concentration of Eu3+ ions. It is also noticed that the color coordinates and value of CRI is sufficient at 0.5 mol% concentration of Eu3+. These results suggest that the proposed phosphor is suitable for WLEDs application. Color correlated temperature (CCT) is also an important parameter to check the characteristics of WLEDs. Previous investigations and literature suggest that if CCT values are < 4000 K then you obtain warm light, whereas if CCT values > 4000 K then you obtain cool light.44 The CCT value can be determined using the following equation:45 CCT = −499n3 + 3525n2 − 6823.3n + 5520.33(4)and, (5)Where, (xe, ye) = (0.332, 0.186).

The determined values of CCT for La1−x−y(PO4):xDy3+,yEu3+ (x = 1.0 mol%, y = 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 mol%) phosphors lies largely in the range of cool light; only for 1 mol% concentration of Eu3+ ions was the CCT value in the warm light region. The calculated CCT values of the prepared co-doped samples lie in the range of 4895–2354 K. As per the results it is noted that the CCT values for the proposed phosphors move from cooler to warmer light.

3.8 Judd–Ofelt parameters
Brain R. Judd and George S. Ofelt proposed a theory called the Judd–Ofelt (J–O) theory to investigate the emission intensity of transitions arising in lanthanides and actinides. This theory is based on three models, namely: the static model, which assume that the central ion is affected by the static electric field (crystal or ligand field) of neighboring host ions; the free ion model, in this model the electric field produced by the host ion acts as a perturbation for the free ion; and Hamiltonian and single configuration model, in this model the interaction between electrons are neglected. To understand the luminescence properties of the Eu3+ co-doped La(PO4):Dy3+ phosphor in detail, the optical transition parameters Ωλ (λ = 2, 4, 6) and quantum efficiency have been calculated according to the theoretical calculations of the J–O theory.
As per the J–O theory, the possibility of the magnetic dipole transition (5D0 → 7F1) of Eu3+ can be calculated using the following equation: (6)where, kmd is the energy of the magnetic dipole transition, n is the refractive index of the host that is calculated using Sellmeier's relation,46 ℏ is Planck’s constant, J′ is the total angular momentum of the initial state (for the 5D0 → 7F1 transition, J′ = 0), Smd is the strength of the magnetic dipole transition and the value of Smd is constant (∼7.83 × 10−42 esu2 cm2) and is not affected by the host material.
According to J–O theory, the electric dipole (ED) transition rate is expressed as: (7)where, AJ is the coefficient of spontaneous emission, e is the charge of the electron, ked is the energy of the ED transition (cm−1), and 〈φJ||Uλ||φ′J′〉2 is the squared reduced matrix element of the 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 2, 4, 6) transitions of Eu3+.
Accordingly, the proportional relationship between the emission intensity of the PL spectra and the transition rate probability of each energy level can be given by the following equation: (8)
Optical transition parameters (Ω2 and Ω4) can be determined using eqn (7). The lifetime of Eu3+ ions at the 5D0 energy level can be represented as:47 (9)
Here, AR is the probability of a 5D0 radiative transition, that is ∑AJ (J = 0–3), AN is the possibility of a 5D0 non-radiative transition.
In the same way, the quantum efficiency (η) of 5D0 can be calculated using the following equation:47 (10)
The determined values of J–O intensity parameters (Ω2 and Ω4) for the emission spectra of the La(PO4):Dy3+,Eu3+ phosphor under 365 nm excitation are presented in the Table 6.

3.9 Solar applications
Rare earth-activated phosphors are also useful for solar cell applications. The literature and previous reports on silicon based solar cells states that solar cells cannot transfer sunlight as full solar energy due to various energy losses – like recombination losses, optical losses, resistivity losses etc.48 Therefore, the solar cell efficiency is low. Among these issues, the most important factor for low energy conversion is optical loss. The main reason behind the optical losses in Si-based solar cells is the spectral mismatch between the solar spectrum and the spectral response of cells in the spectrum range 400 to 1100 nm.48 The spectral mismatch results in about 60% energy loss in solar cells.48,49 Such energy loss can be minimized by coating a suitable layer of down-conversion phosphors or up-conversion phosphors, which can convert incident light into photons of different wavelength.49 In this investigation, we coat a layer of down-conversion phosphor on the surface of the solar cell, which can reduce the energy loss and increase the efficiency of the solar cell.

3.9.1 
            I–V characteristics. 
The I–V characteristics of blank Si-solar cell and La1−x−y(PO4):xDy3+, yEu3+ (x = 1.0 mol%, y = 1 mol%) phosphor coated Si-solar cell were investigated under sunlight and a solar simulator. Fig. 20(a) shows the I–V characteristics of the blank Si-solar cell and coated Si-solar cell under sunlight, while Fig. 20(b) shows the I–V characteristics under the solar simulator. The slope values of the linear fitted experimental data are given in Table 7. The enhancement in solar cell efficiency can be determined using the following formula: (11)

From eqn (11), it is calculated that solar cell efficiency is enhanced around 17.34% and 12.76%, after coating the surface of a Si-solar cell with the sample and exposing to direct sunlight or a solar simulator, respectively.


3.9.2 Spectral response. 

Fig. 21 shows the solar spectrum with excitation and emission spectra of the proposed phosphor. The literature suggests that energy efficiency can be enhanced if coating materials have the following properties: (a) excitation wavelength between 350–550 nm, (b) emission wavelength between 350 and 1100 nm, and (d) high quantum efficiency.50 The excitation spectra show excitation in the range 300 nm to 500 nm, and emission in the range of 400 nm 650 nm. Therefore, it is suggested that the proposed phosphor can reduce energy losses arising due to spectral mismatch.

4. Conclusions
This investigation reports the synthesis and luminescence properties of color tunable La(PO4):Dy3+,Eu3+ phosphors. In the present work, Dy3+,Eu3+ doped and co-doped La(PO4) phosphors were prepared by a solid state reaction method. The synthesized phosphors were characterized by several techniques. The structural refinement of the synthesized phosphor was also carried out in the present work. Rietveld analysis suggests that the synthesized phosphor was successfully synthesized. The SEM images of the samples show microsized particles around 0.5 μm to 2 μm. Under NUV and blue excitation, La(PO4):Dy3+ exhibit blue and yellow emissions around 482 nm and 571 nm due to 4F9/2 → 6H15/2 and 4F9/2 → 6H13/2 transitions in the Dy3+ ions. Whereas, La(PO4):Eu3+ exhibits orange and red emission around 593 nm and 618 nm due to 5D0 → 7F1 and 5D0 → 7F2 transitions in the Eu3+ ions. In this investigation, energy transfer behavior and the effect of co-doping were analyzed. The Eu3+ co-doped La(PO4):Dy3+ phosphor shows emission around the white color region with good CRI and CCT values. Furthermore, I–V characteristics and the solar spectrum response were analyzed for solar applications. From the investigation, it was found that solar cell efficiency was enhanced by around 17.34% and 12.76% under direct sunlight or a solar simulator, respectively. The overall investigation results suggest that the proposed phosphors are suitable candidates for WLEDs and solar cell applications.
