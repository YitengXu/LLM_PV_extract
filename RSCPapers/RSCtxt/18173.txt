    , Accepted 12th March 2017First published on 13th March 2017AbstractIn this study, simple inorganic routes for the synthesis of WO3 and W18O49 nanostructures with variable size and self-assembly are reported. The morphologies and formation of stoichiometric WO3 as well as substoichiometric W18O49 single-crystal phase could be controlled by changing the pH of the reactions medium. This synthesis strategy has the advantages that it is one step, aqueous medium-based, and requires no surfactant or stabilizing agent. Furthermore, it also enables the self-assembly of 1D nanorods of WO3 and W18O49 into hierarchical nanostructures as nanorods bundles, cocoons, urchins, fishbones, etc. This synthesis method may open up a new way to control and tune the stoichiometric and substoichiometric composition of metal oxide nanostructures. Efficient sunlight-driven photocatalytic performance to degrade Rhodamine B (100 mL; 40 mg L−1) with these tungsten oxide nanostructures was also demonstrated.
1. Introduction
The synthesis and assembly of nanostructured building blocks into suitable superstructures is an important prerequisite for realizing the application potential of nanomaterials. One-dimensional (1D) building block, such as nanorods, nanowires, and nanotubes, can be orderly assembled into appropriate two- or three- dimensional (2D or 3D) architectures. The collective chemical and physical properties of the ordered organization of 2D or 3D nanostructures, as well as their applications (e.g. optical, electrical, magnetic, and catalysis), highly depends on the size, shape, and assembly of the building block nanocrystals.1–5 Many methods have been reported for the integration of nanorods or nanowires as building blocks into 2D or 3D superstructure and also several hierarchical structures.6–11 However, it still remains a significant challenge to develop a facile, aqueous, surfactant/stabilizer-free rational synthesis strategy towards the shape-controlled self-assembly for the formation of 2D or 3D hierarchical nanostructures with tailored morphologies and patterns from 1D nanostructures.
Over the past few decades, tungsten oxide has attracted significant attention for various applications such as photocatalysis,12–15 photoelectrocatalysis,16 gas sensors,17–21 anode materials for Li-ion batteries,22 electrochromic devices,23,24 field emitters,25 and supercapacitors.26,27 Among the different forms of tungsten oxide, hexagonal tungsten oxide (h-WO3) has attracted more interest due to its unique tunnel structure.28 Consequently, it has been widely studied as an intercalation host for acquiring hexagonal tungsten bronzes MxWO3 (M = H+, alkali and alkaline earth metal).29 h-WO3 is a promising material for a range of applications, such as the positive electrodes of rechargeable lithium batteries,22,30–32 an efficient photoanode for solar water splitting,33 electrochemical energy storage34 and resistive switching devices.35
Besides the stoichiometric composition of tungsten oxide as WO3 and WO2, the substoichiometric composition as WO3−δ (0 < δ < 1) can also be synthesized via creating an oxygen vacancy and the formation of various types of defect structure, such as W25O73 (WO2.92), W5O14 (WO2.8) and W18O49 (WO2.72). Among these, W18O49 is the only oxide that can be isolated in a pure form, which contains tungsten ions of mixed valency along with the largest oxygen vacancy.36 Therefore, the synthesis of nanostructured W18O49 is of great research interest, owing to its unusual defect structure and interesting chemical and physical properties in the nanometre regime.37–39 Nanostructured W18O49 have been found to have potential applications in various fields, including gas sensors,40,41 electrochromic windows,42 supercapacitors,43 field emission,44 IR absorption,36 photoluminescence,39 photocatalysts45 and the ablation of cancer cells.46
The most common methods for the synthesis of the 3D nanostructure of WO3 and W18O49 reported are limited to high-temperature synthesis via a vapour or vapour–solid process,47–50 using templates,15,16,21 surfactants,10,51–53 inorganic additives,11,54–56 thermal decomposition of the precursor,57 solvothermal53,58–61 and hydrothermal52,62–64 methods. WO3 and W18O49 nanostructures with a range of sizes and shapes, including 1D (e.g. nanorods,63,65 nanowires,39,64 nanotubes54), 2D (e.g. nanobelts,59 nanoribbons,11,32 nanosheets61,66) and self-assembled 3D (e.g. urchins,11 flower-like,57,58,60 brush-like,53 nanobundles,67 nanococoons,56 nanotrees47,68) are known. However, the selective formation of WO3 and W18O49 nanostructures via a small change in a single process is rare.48,50,69,70
Herein, we report a simple inorganic route for the synthesis of h-WO3 and W18O49 hierarchical nanostructures with variable size, and self-assembly by a simple tuning of the reaction parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the selective formation of stoichiometric WO3 and substoichiometric composition W18O49 with several hierarchical nanostructures via a small variation in a solution-based process. The important role of Na2SO4 and K2SO4 as structure-directing agents in the synthesis is also demonstrated. Most significantly, this method is shown to provide facile control of the self-assembling of WO3 and W18O49 nanorod networks leading to nanorod bundles, cocoons, urchins, fishbones and a few other patterns.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthetic procedures
In all the experiments, we used chemicals of analytical purity as such without purification. In a typical experiment, 2.3 g (7 mmol) of Na2WO4·2H2O, 0.249 g (1.75 mmol) of Na2SO4 and 0.306 g (1.75 mmol) of K2SO4 were dissolved in 40 ml milliQ water at room temperature, as reported previously by W. Zeng et al.71 Under constant stirring, the pH of the solutions were then adjusted by the dropwise addition of 2 M HCL. The solution colour changed from colourless to light to darker yellow with decreasing pH. After stirring for an additional 30 min, the solution was added to a 30 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 24 h in a hot air oven and then cooled to room temperature naturally. The products (bluish green to light green colour) were collected by vacuum filtration and washed repeatedly with milliQ water and ethanol and then dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 5 h. The tungsten oxide nanostructures were prepared typically between pH 0.95–2.35. The samples obtained were named as W-0.95, W-1.5, W-1.76, W-2.05 and W-2.35, where the digital number indicates the pH of the solutions.
2.2 Characterization
The as-prepared samples were characterized by UV-vis spectra, taken on a Shimadzu, UV-3600 Plus spectrometer by using BaSO4 as the reference. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker Optics ALPHA-E spectrometer with a universal Zn–Se ATR (attenuated total reflection) accessory in the 600–4000 cm−1 region. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded on a Pananalytical X'pert PRO powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) at a voltage of 40 kV and current of 30 mA. The morphologies of the as-synthesized products were observed using a scanning electron microscope (FEI, ESEM Quanta 200-3D). Structural and composition analysis were investigated using a transmission electron microscope (FEI, Tecnai 20 ST) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV along with X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The TEM samples were prepared by drop-casting the sample from water on carbon-coated copper grids (TED PELLA INC., 200 mesh). Raman spectra were recorded on the powder sample using a Horiba JY Labraman HR 800 micro-Raman spectrometer with 632.8 nm He–Ne laser radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were taken using a custom-built ambient pressure photoelectron spectrometer (Lab-APPES) (Prevac, Poland) equipped with a VG Scienta SAX 100 monochromator using Al Kα X-rays as the excitation source and VG Scienta's R3000 differentially pumped analyzer.72 The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was measured by the nitrogen gas adsorption–desorption method on a Quantachrome Quadrasorb automatic volumetric instrument.
2.3 Photocatalytic degradation experiments
The photocatalytic activities of the tungsten oxide nanostructures, W-1.5 and W-2.05, were compared by the degradation of Rhodamine B in an aqueous solution. Here, the photocatalyst (1 g L−1) was added to an aqueous solution of Rhodamine B (100 mL; 40 mg L−1) in a round-bottom flask at room temperature in air. 1 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution was added to the previously prepared solution as an electron acceptor. The suspended solution was first sonicated for 1 min for homogeneous dispersion of the photocatalyst in water and was then kept in the dark for 30 min with continuous stirring to establish an adsorption–desorption equilibrium.73 Thereafter, this suspension was radiated with direct sunlight (date and time of experiments: Jan. 22–28, 2017; ∼12–2 pm). To minimize the heat effect under direct sunlight, the photocatalytic degradation reaction was carried out in an ice-water bath and the temperature of the bath was maintained about 2–5 °C. 1 mL of the mixture solution was withdrawn after each specific irradiation time and the suspended solids were separated by a centrifugation process. The photocatalytic degradation process was monitored (after establishing the adsorption–desorption equilibrium for 30 min) using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV1003M207, Cary 300Conc, measuring the maximum absorption of RB at 554 nm). To study the effect of sunlight, the photocatalysts were added into the Rhodamine B solution, but the resulting suspension was monitored in the dark, without the sunlight exposure under the same reaction conditions. The self-degradation of Rhodamine B solution was also examined via a control experiment without the addition of photocatalysts under sunlight, following the same irradiation conditions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and morphology
The effect of pH on the hydrothermal product was investigated by varying the pH of the solutions as 0.95, 1.50 1.76, 2.05 and 2.35, while the other parameters, such as the concentration of the precursor, the reaction temperature and time and the autoclave volume remained unchanged. The experimental results clearly revealed that the solution pH had a significant effect on the morphology, crystalline phase and composition of the tungsten oxide nanostructures. The role of inorganic additives, such as Na2SO4 and K2SO4, towards the nanostructure evolution was also investigated.

3.1.1 Effect of pH in the presence of inorganic additives (such as Na2SO4 and K2SO4). 

Fig. 1 displays the typical XRD patterns of the as-synthesized products at different pH values, which enabled us to investigate the structure, phase and purity of the products. The XRD pattern of W-0.95 and W-1.50 could be indexed to the well-crystalline hexagonal WO3 (JCPDS no. 75-2187) with the lattice parameters of a = b = 7.298, c = 3.899 Å.71 The smooth, narrow and strong XRD peaks obtained from W-0.95 and W-1.50 with the strongest diffraction peak from the (200) crystal plane revealed that the products were highly crystalline, single-phase WO3 with a strong preferred orientation. On the contrary, in the case of W-2.05 (higher pH value), the XRD pattern matched well with the monoclinic phase W18O49 (JCPDS 71-2450). The corresponding powder XRD pattern exhibited two sharp reflections at 2θ 23.04 and 47.07, matching well with the (010) and (020) reflections of W18O49. All the other reflections were much weaker and therefore this indicated a preferred orientation along the (010) direction, which agrees well with prior literature, since the close-packed planes of monoclinic W18O49 are (010).39,46 For W-2.35, the only strong diffraction peak was observed at 2θ 22.9, which could be possibly due to a change in the crystallinity of the sample; while for sample W-1.76, monoclinic W18O49 co-existed with hexagonal WO3, as evidenced from Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the products W-0.95, W-1.5, W-1.76, W-2.05 and W-2.35 with reference to: WO3 JCPDS No. 75-2187 and W18O49 JCPDS No. 71-2450. 
Morphological evaluation of the as-synthesized products at the various pH values was carried out based on SEM images. Fig. 2 and S4 (see ESI†) show the SEM images of W-0.95, W-1.5, W-1.76, W-2.05 and W-2.35. It is clear from the SEM images that the pH value of the reaction plays a crucial role in controlling the morphology of the tungsten oxide nanostructures. At pH 0.95, nanorods were obtained with an average thickness of 20–100 nm and the length of a couple of hundred nm, as represented in Fig. 2a. When the pH value was increased to 1.5, hierarchical nanostructures as nanorods-based bundles were obtained (Fig. 2b). Each bundle was actually composed of a large quantity of well-defined nanorods that were 20–100 nm in diameter and micrometre-sized in length. Further increasing the pH to 1.76 yielded a cocoon-like hierarchical 3D assembly (Fig. 2c) consisting of nanorods with diameters of 10–50 nm and the length of a few micrometres. Urchin-like hierarchical structures were obtained with increasing the pH to 2.05, which were composed of a large number of radical nanorods. The nanorods were 10–50 nm in diameter and a few micrometres in length. A further increase in the pH to 2.35 led to the formation of similarly thin but considerably longer nanorods with a fishbone-type assembly. It was reported that the formation of various WO3 nanostructures is pH dependent, since the number of initially generated nuclei is correlated to the degree of acidity.65,74,75 But to the best of our knowledge, we observed for the first time the formation of stoichiometric WO3 as well as substoichiometric W18O49 with various hierarchical 3D nanostructures, which depends critically on the pH of the solution.

3.1.2 Effect of pH in the absence of inorganic additives (such as Na2SO4 and K2SO4). 
To understand the effect of pH on the tungsten oxide nanostructures in the absence of Na2SO4 and K2SO4, we carried out hydrothermal experiments at similar pH values (e.g. 0.95, 1.50, 1.76, 2.05 and 2.35) under the same reaction conditions. Herein, we observed that the XRD patterns of the resulting products obtained at pH 0.95 and 1.50 (Fig. 3) were similar and matched with the orthorhombic WO3·0.33H2O (JCPDS 72-0199) with the lattice parameters of a = 7.359, b = 12.513, c = 7.704 Å.75 However, with further increases in the pH to 1.76, 2.05 and 2.35, the XRD pattern was matched well with the hexagonal WO3 (JCPDS no. 75-2187), which was previously obtained for the products W-0.95 and W-1.50.
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of the products obtained in the absence of inorganic additives from pH 0.95, 1.5, 1.76, 2.05 and 2.35 with reference to: WO3·0.33H2O JCPDS No. 72-0199 and WO3 JCPDS No. 75-2187. 
The morphology and microstructure of the products obtained at various pH values were identified using SEM images (Fig. 4). The experimental results clearly suggest that the morphology and crystalline phase of tungsten oxide significantly depended on the solution pH, even without the addition of any structure-directing agents. At pH 0.95 and 1.5, hierarchical 1–3 μm sized flower-like microspheres (Fig. 4a) and ∼1 μm sized nanodisks assembly (Fig. 4b) of o-WO3·0.33H2O were obtained, respectively. A further increase in the solution pH to 1.76 led to the formation of hierarchical nanostructures as nanorods-based bundles less than micrometre-sized in length (Fig. 4c). The increase in solution pH to 2.05 and 2.35 resulted in a significant increase in the length of the nanorods-based bundles (Fig. 4d and e). Further multidirectional growth of radical nanorods on the nanorods-based bundles was then observed at pH 2.35 (Fig. 4e).

3.1.3 Effect of inorganic additives (such as Na2SO4 and K2SO4) at pH 2.05. 
To gain further insight about the role of Na2SO4 and K2SO4 on the formation of substoichiometric tungsten oxide, we performed and compared the XRD analysis for the products obtained at pH 2.05 in the absence of (a) Na2SO4 and K2SO4; in the presence of (b) Na2SO4 (c) K2SO4 and (d) Na2SO4 and K2SO4, i.e. W-2.05 (Fig. 5). Here, we noticed that for the product obtained from (a) and (b), the XRD patterns could be indexed to the hexagonal WO3 (JCPDS no. 75-2187), same as for W-0.95 and W-1.50; for (d) the product was characterized as monoclinic W18O49 (W-2.05: JCPDS 71-2450), while for (c), hexagonal WO3 co-existed with the monoclinic W18O49. Therefore, the XRD analyses verified that Na2SO4 and K2SO4 play a significant role towards the formation of substoichiometric tungsten oxide as W18O49 alongside the pH of the precursor solutions.

We also carried out SEM analysis for the morphology and microstructure of the products, as shown in Fig. 6. Nanorods-based bundles were obtained in the absence of both Na2SO4 and K2SO4 (Fig. 6a), while separated needle-shaped nanorods were obtained in the presence of only Na2SO4 (Fig. 6b). But, in the presence of only K2SO4, nanorods were self-assembled and gave rise to an urchin-like assembly with a thicker 3D packing of nanorods (Fig. 6c), and in the presence of both Na2SO4 and K2SO4, well separated urchin-like hierarchical structures with a size of around 1–2 μm were obtained (Fig. 6d). The important role of K2SO4/SO42− as a structure-directing agent for WO3 and W18O49 nanostructures was well investigated.11,54,64,76 It has been reported that SO42− ions can be selectively absorbed to specific crystallographic facets, leading to a slow growth rate along a particular crystallographic direction, which results in a preferential growth along another direction. Thus SO42− facilitates the formation of 1D tungsten oxide nanostructures. According to earlier literature,54 Na+ ions also plays a crucial role in the shape-control processes of tungsten oxide, because its hydrated ionic radii is larger than K+. Herein we observed a separation of the nanoclusters in the presence of Na2SO4 in case of both 6(b) and 6(d).

3.1.4 Detailed microscopic and structural properties analysis of the products obtained as stoichiometric WO3 and substoichiometric W18O49 from 3.1.1. 
To gain more insights into the nanostructures of these stoichiometric and substoichiometric tungsten oxide assemblies, TEM, HRTEM and selected area electron diffraction analysis were performed for the products obtained at various pH in the presence of inorganic additives, such as Na2SO4 and K2SO4. Fig. 7 represents the TEM images of the products: (a) W-0.95, (b) W-1.5, (c) W-1.76, (d) W-2.05 and (e) W-2.35, which further confirm the size and self-assembly of the nanorods as discussed before (3.1.1). The HRTEM micrographs (inset) taken from one individual nanorod in the case of W-0.95 and W-1.50 show that the nanorods were grown along the (001) direction (as indicated by an arrow). The clear lattice fringes corresponding to the (001) crystalline plane of hexagonal WO3 with a d-spacing of 0.389 nm can be seen, indicating the single-crystal quality of the WO3 nanorods for W-0.95 and W-1.50. Furthermore, the ED pattern shows strong (00k) spots, confirming that the (001) is indeed the preferential growth direction (Fig. S5, see ESI†). In the case of W-1.76, lattice fringes corresponding to hexagonal WO3 were observed with a d-spacing of 0.389 nm, but the SAED pattern confirms the co-existence of h-WO3 and m-W18O49 in the sample (Fig. S5, see ESI†) which matches well with the results from the XRD analysis (Fig. 1). In addition, for W-2.05, the HRTEM image (Fig. 7d) shows that the spacing between adjacent lattice planes is 0.378 nm, which corresponds to the d-spacing for the (010) planes of monoclinic W18O49.46,77 The ED pattern shows three strong (0k0) rings, indicating that the preferential growth direction is (010) (Fig. S5, see ESI†). As evidenced from the XRD analysis, a decrease in crystallinity for W-2.35 can be observed in the HRTEM images, while the ED pattern confirms the presence of (010) planes of monoclinic W18O49. All the microscopy analyses of the products were in good agreement with the XRD analyses. The self-assembled nanorods structures could be disassembled by aqueous ultrasonication under a long treatment time, as illustrated in Fig. S8 (see ESI†).
 Fig. 7  TEM and HRTEM images (inset) of the products: (a) W-0.95, (b) W-1.5, (c) W-1.76, (d) W-2.05 and (e) W-2.35. 
XPS analysis was carried out to evaluate the surface electronic structure and elemental valence of the products W-1.50 and W-2.05, as shown in Fig. 8. The full range of XPS clearly shows the peaks at the binding energies corresponding to oxygen and tungsten; while, no impurities other than carbon were observed in the spectrum (Fig. S6, see ESI†). In the case of W-1.5, well-resolved W4f doublet peaks at 35.5 and 37.6 eV were observed due to spin–orbit coupling of electrons and these correspond to W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2, respectively, agreeing well with the W6+ state from WO3 (Fig. 8a). For W-2.05, four peaks corresponding to W4f were observed in the XPS spectrum (Fig. 8b). Two peaks observed at 35.6 and 37.8 eV correspond to W6+, while the other two peaks at 34.8 and 36.7 eV correspond to W5+. The occurrence of two oxidation states is one of the typical features of W18O49 nanomaterials, as reported earlier.39 These indicate that the surface chemistry and the elemental valance of the products are very different; the product W-1.5 is actually stoichiometric tungsten oxide (WO3), while W-2.05 is substoichiometric tungsten oxide as W18O49, which match well with the XRD and other microscopic results.
 Fig. 8  XPS spectra of the products: (a) W-1.5 and (b) W-2.05. 
A UV-vis-NIR profile comparison between the products W-1.5, W-1.76 and W-2.05 showed an absorption tail in the NIR region, which may arise due to the presence of an oxygen vacancy due to the formation of W18O49 as reported earlier (Fig. S1, see ESI†).39,78 In the case of the FT-IR spectra of products W-1.5 and W-2.05, broad absorption peaks between 1000 and 600 cm−1 were observed, which were characteristic of the stretching vibrations of W–O and O–W–O bonds (Fig. S2, see ESI†) for tungsten oxide.75 The BET surface area results obtained from the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms for W-0.95, W-1.5, W-1.76, W-2.05 and W-2.35 were 25.88, 41.71, 43.01, 32.88 and 59.74 m2 g−1 (Fig. S3, see ESI†).
Raman spectroscopy was carried out to analyse the structural properties of the stoichiometric and substoichiometric tungsten oxide, such as WO3 (W-1.5) and W18O49 (W-2.05) (Fig. 9 and Fig. S7, see ESI†). Characteristic Raman bands were observed at 254, 322, 704 and 819 cm−1 for W-1.5 (Fig. 9a) and 254, 324, 731 and 803 cm−1 for W-1.76 (Fig. 9b), of which first two bands arise from the O–W–O bending modes and last two bands from the O–W–O stretching modes, as reported previously.43 The band near 960 cm−1 was assigned to the W6+ = O symmetric stretching mode of terminal oxygen atom most likely located at the surfaces of the nanoclusters. Since product W-2.05 was identified as W18O49 and there were reports that W18O49 can be easily oxidized by heating,79 the Raman spectra of W-2.05 were measured with a stepwise increase in laser power, as shown in Fig. 9c. Since the crystal structure of W18O49 contains a wide range of bond lengths of W–O–W, at low laser power (between 2–10 mW), broad featureless bands located at ∼100–400 cm−1 and 600–900 cm−1 could be observed, which agree well with the previously reported literature of the W18O49 nanostructure.36,79 When the laser power reached 20 mW, distinct Raman peaks at 246 and 808 cm−1 appear along with broad peaks at ∼325 and 718 cm−1. While increasing the laser power, the temperature of the sample W18O49 also increases, which may lead to the oxidation of W18O49 to WO3 in the presence of ambient oxygen. On tuning down the laser power to 5 and 2 mW in the same position of the sample, as shown in Fig. 9d, the distinguished Raman peaks formed at 252 and 808 cm−1 (characteristic Raman bands of WO3) remain present in the spectra. But with the change of the sample position (Fig. 9d), similar broad featureless bands were again observed at 5 mW, which suggests that W18O49 was locally oxidized to WO3 in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. It is further interesting to note that there was a high intensification of the Raman signal for the product obtained with a decreasing pH of the reaction solution (Fig. S7, see ESI†). This may be due to an increase in the grain size of the crystallites.
 Fig. 9  Raman spectra of the products: (a) W-1.5, (b) W-1.76 obtained at a laser power of 20 mW. W-2.05 irradiated at various laser power: (c) with increasing the laser power from 2 mW, 5 mW, 10 mW, 20 mW and (d) with decreasing the laser power from 20 mW, 5 mW, 2 mW on the same position of the sample and 5 mW*, where ‘*’ represents the changed sample position. 
All the above results obtained from 3.1.1 to 3.1.4, clearly suggest that the products obtained as tungsten oxide have significantly different crystal structures (orthorhombic-WO3·0.33H2O, hexagonal-WO3 and monoclinic-W18O49) and morphology, even when they are prepared under similar experimental conditions, but in the absence or presence of sodium sulfate and potassium sulfate and by varying the pH of the precursor solutions. To understand the structural revolution, a scheme of the phase transformation from orthorhombic-WO3.0.33H2O to hexagonal-WO3 to monoclinic-W18O49 is suggested in Fig. 10. The orthorhombic-WO3·0.33H2O was obtained with pH ≤ 1.5, in the absence of Na2SO4 and K2SO4. The structure of orthorhombic-WO3·0.33H2O consists of an infinite plane of [WO6] octahedra created by sharing their corners and thereby forming six-membered rings along the (001) plane (Fig. 10a). The structure is made up of two different types of [WO6] octahedra. In type I [WO6], all the six W–O single bonds share the same bond length, while the type II octahedra [WO5(H2O)] is made up of two types of oxygen atoms combined with a tungsten atom, forming a shorter WO bond and a longer W–OH2 bond, respectively.75 In type I [WO6], six oxygen atoms are connected to six different octahedra by corner-sharing; four oxygen atoms along the (001)/ab plane in the same layer and the other two oxygen atoms [perpendicular to the (001) plane] with the adjacent layers above and below. In the case of type II [WO5(H2O)], even though four oxygen atoms along the (001) plane are shared by neighbouring octahedra in the same layer, the other two oxygen atoms are perpendicular to the (001) plane, but because of the shorter and longer WO and W–OH2 bonds, it is impossible to bond with adjacent layers above and below. Accordingly, an infinite layer in the (001) plane is formed by corner-sharing by the type I and type II octahedra. Therefore, orthorhombic WO3·0.33H2O structures are made up by the stacking of layers along the [001] direction, with each next layer shifted by a/2, as shown in Fig. 10a.80 Therefore, in the case of orthorhombic WO3·0.33H2O, restricted stacking along the c axis gives rise to a disc-like morphology (flower-like microsphere and nanodisks assembly), as in the case described in 3.1.2 (Fig. 4a and b). With an increase in the pH, 2.05 ≤ pH or with the addition of an inorganic structure-directing agent (Na2SO4 and K2SO4) at pH ≤ 1.5, orthorhombic-WO3·0.33H2O is transformed to the thermodynamically favourable metastable hexagonal WO3. Fig. 10b represents the hexagonal WO3 structure, which is made up of [WO6] octahedra, with each oxygen atom shared with another octahedron. This hexagonal WO3 is built up of slightly distorted [WO6] octahedra arranged in six-membered rings in layers normal to the hexagonal axis. Such a stacking of planes along the (001) axis leads to the formation of large hexagonal-shaped tunnels, while restacking along the c axis gives rise to a rod-like morphology (Fig. 2a and b, 4c–e and 6a and b).75 The reduction of WO3 was observed with further increasing the pH, for 2.05 ≤ pH, along with the addition of both Na2SO4 and K2SO4, via the formation of W18O49, which directs the structural changes of the [WO6] octahedral. The structure illustration of W18O49 in the (010) projection (Fig. 10c) shows the formation of tungsten regular pentagon columns of edge-shared [WO6] octahedra and nearly regular hexagonal vacant channels formed by the oxygens.78,81 These columns probably lead to the thin rod or wire-like morphology for the W18O49 nanostructure (Fig. 2d and e and 7d and e).

Fig. 11 demonstrates the probable crystal-growth mechanism via the self-assembly process of tungsten oxide with different morphologies in the presence and absence of Na2SO4 and K2SO4 with the variation of the pH of the solutions. In the absence of Na2SO4 and K2SO4, at pH 0.95 and 1.5, the WO3·0.33H2O nuclei during subsequent hydrothermal treatment grow along the (001) direction, but the restricted stacking along the c axis gives rise to a disc-like morphology, which further grows into hierarchical 1–3 μm sized flower-like microspheres and a micro-disk assembly. Whereas at higher pH (1.5 ≤ pH ≤ 2.35), the hexagonal WO3 seeds grow along the (001) direction to form small nanorods, which consequently form nanorod bundles to minimize the surface energy. Further increases of the pH from 1.76 to 2.35 resulted in a significant increase in the lengths of the nanorods-based bundles, because of continuous growth along the (001) direction due to the Ostwald ripening process. A similar observation was observed for the growth of hexagonal WO3 seeds at pH 0.95 and 1.5 in the presence of Na2SO4 and K2SO4. At pH 2.05 and 2.35, in the presence of both Na2SO4 and K2SO4 and with the substoichiometric composition of tungsten oxide, W18O49 nuclei were formed and their 1D growth as well as formation of self-assembled structure leads to an urchin and fishbone-like assembly, respectively. Although little is known about the control on the crystal structure evolution and the mechanism behind the tuning of the stoichiometric and substoichiometric composition of tungsten oxide nanostructures, the crucial role of pH and sodium sulfate and potassium sulfate has been clearly demonstrated in the current case.

3.2 Photocatalytic performance
The as-synthesized tungsten oxide nanostructures were examined for photocatalytic applications. The degradation of Rhodamine B (RB) in aqueous solution in the presence of sunlight was used as the indicator of the photocatalytic activity. The blank experiment with no photocatalyst showed that the RB solution was hardly degraded after exposure to the chosen sunlight radiation for 60 min. The results therefore confirmed that the presence of photocatalysts increases the degradation process appreciably. When the tungsten oxide nanostructures were irradiated by sunlight, photogenerated electrons and holes were formed in the conduction band (CB) and valance band (VB) of tungsten oxide, respectively. In these experiments, the added H2O2 acts as an electron acceptor and generates active hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), which consequently degrade the RB.73 The preliminary results suggest that the composition and morphology of the tungsten oxide nanostructures greatly influence the photocatalytic ability (Fig. 12). The stoichiometric tungsten oxide (W-1.5, WO3) exhibited better photocatalytic efficiency in this study and bleached 75% and 99% of the dye in 30 and 60 min, respectively (Fig. 12a). In the presence of sunlight, the characteristic peak of RB diminished sharply in the case of W-1.5 with increasing the irradiation time, and consequently the colour of the RB solution changed from violet to colourless within 60 min (inset of Fig. 12a and S9, see ESI†). Whereas, substoichiometric compositions of tungsten oxide nanostructures (W-2.05, W18O49) exhibited a maximum photo-bleaching of 70% in 30 min (Fig. 12b and S9, see ESI†). These result can be correlated with the crystallinity and surface area of the photocatalyst. Herein, W-1.5, with a higher crystallinity and surface area than W-2.05, provided more active sites for the reactant molecules. The partially reduced oxidation states and the poor crystallinity observed for W18O49 nanostructures (W-2.05) led to the recombination of photogenerated electron and holes at the defect position. Probably therefore, W-1.5 shows enhanced photocatalytic activity in comparison to W-2.05.

4. Conclusions
In summary, hexagonal WO3 and monoclinic W18O49 with different 3D hierarchical nanostructures with tailored morphologies, such as nanorods bundles, cocoons, urchins, fishbones, were successfully synthesized using a facile hydrothermal strategy based on a self-assembly mechanism without any catalyst, surfactants or stabilizing agents or conventional template. This aqueous route should be viable for the large-scale production of three-dimensional hierarchical nanostructures of WO3 and W18O49, which were consequently able to be disassembled. The pH of the reaction solution as well as the presence of M2SO4 (M = Na, K) in the reaction play crucial roles towards the evolution of the desired nanostructures and compositions. UV-vis, IR, PXRD, RAMAN, XPS, SEM and TEM confirmed the products formations. The intrinsic Raman spectrum of the W18O49 nanostructure was studied, and the effect of the laser power for the localized oxidation of W18O49 to WO3 was confirmed. This simple synthesis method may open up a new way to control and tune the stoichiometric and substoichiometric composition of metal oxide nanostructures. The sunlight-driven photocatalytic properties were studied for the stoichiometric and substoichiometric composition of tungsten oxide nanostructures. In addition, the efficient sunlight-driven photocatalytic behaviour of tungsten oxide nanostructures for the decomposition of RB (100 ml; 40 mg L−1) was also demonstrated. These results indicate that the tungsten oxide nanostructures are promising candidate materials as photocatalysts for wastewater treatment, where they could help to achieve the efficient decomposition of environmental organic contaminants under sunlight.
