    , Accepted 1st May 2014First published on 10th June 2014AbstractWe report here the synthesis and characterization of two novel semiconducting quinoxaline (FQ)-benzodithiophene (BDT) based copolymers, PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2, in which the BDT unit is substituted with either 2-octylthienyl (-TR1) or 2,3-dihexylthienyl (-T2R2), respectively, as side groups. The effect of the alkyl side chain(s), linked to the thienyl side groups, on the optical, electronic and morphological properties of the resulting polymers is investigated and correlated with the photovoltaic performance. Solution-processed BHJ solar cells, using these copolymers as electron donor materials and PC61BM (or PC71BM) as an electron acceptor counterpart, are prepared by a blade-coating technique under ambient conditions. As a result, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ∼5.7% and ∼3.4% have been achieved for PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2 based devices, respectively, highlighting the crucial role of the alkyl portion of the π-conjugated side segment in the optoelectronic properties of this class of copolymers.
1 Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells represent the newest generation of technologies in solar power generation, offering benefits in terms of low manufacturing costs, large area coverage, compatibility with flexible and light-weight substrates, earth-abundant constituents and architectural tunability over multiple length scales.1 π-conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives are the typical constituents of the active layer in so-called bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells,2 in which these two materials, acting as an electron donor and an electron acceptor, respectively, are deposited as a finely intermixed blend film placed between a semitransparent anode (ITO) and a metal cathode. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of lab-scale single-junction BHJ solar cells has reached ∼8–10% (ref. 3) by the synergic development of novel active materials,3,4 enhanced understanding of polymeric film microstructures5 and meticulous device optimization,6 indicating a bright future for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells in commercial applications.7
The properties of photoactive materials are one of the most determining factors for the preparation of highly efficient polymer solar cells.8 An ideal donor polymer should fulfill some fundamental requirements such as: (i) broad absorption spectrum with high absorption coefficient, (ii) high charge carrier mobility, (iii) optimal energetic alignment of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels with those of the acceptor material to ideally provide large open-circuit voltages (VOC), environmental stability and efficient exciton dissociation,9 and (iv) appropriate film forming and nano-structuring capabilities once blended with the acceptor counterpart.
A well-known strategy to obtain efficient donor polymers is to alternate electron-rich and electron-deficient conjugated moieties in the backbone. In this push–pull architecture, the nature and the electronic properties of the donor and acceptor units, as well as the substituents anchored to the building blocks, play a fundamental role and represent an important and widely spread technique used to modulate the chemical and physical properties of the resulting semiconducting polymers. Indeed, besides the design of conjugated polymers with different backbone structures, the modulation of the polymers' properties by changing the influence of the electronic distribution, the geometry, number and position of their side groups has also attracted much attention as a molecular design approach for photoactive polymers.10
Among these, two-dimensional (2D) π-conjugated polymers exhibited several advantages and very promising OPV responses. The use of alkyl substituted aromatic side groups on the copolymer backbone has been demonstrated to both enhance the solubility of the macromolecule and contribute to extend the π-conjugation from the backbone to the lateral substituents, leading to a more extended or 2D π-conjugated system.11 For instance, Li et al.11a reported the synthesis and characterization of a 2D-conjugated polymer with alkyl-thiophene π-conjugated side chains, which showed improved optical, electronic and electrical properties with enhanced photovoltaic responses (PCEs of ∼6%) compared to the corresponding alkoxy-substituted copolymer. Recently, we also designed new 2D-conjugated push–pull polymers P(1)-Q-BDT-4TR and P(2)-FQ-BDT-4TR,12 based on alternate alkyl-dithiophene (2TR) substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and quinoxaline (Q) units. We found that the introduction of dithiophene-based (2TR) side chains on the BDT unit effectively allows the obtainment of a polymer with red-shifted absorption maxima (Δλmax > 30 nm), a lowered HOMO level (ΔHOMO > 0.1 eV), with respect to the analogous polymer (PBDT-TFQ)13 containing alkoxy side chains on the BDT unit. As a result, BHJ solar cells with short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and PCE of 10.2 mA cm−2, 0.90 V, 58% and 5.3%, respectively, were prepared.
Besides extending the lateral π-conjugation of 2D-polymers, the nature, length, conformation (linear or branched), position and number of alkyl side chains in the side groups strongly influence the main properties of the resulting polymers, such as: (i) solubility, (ii) miscibility with the acceptor counterpart and, (iii) structural conformation by favoring planarity or torsion angles on the backbone, thus promoting or hindering intra- and inter-molecular interactions.14 As a result, the optical, morphological and electrical properties of the polymer films can be controlled and optimized. Indeed, the fine structural tuning of alkyl side chains represents an effective and common design strategy for various classes of efficient donor polymers.
In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of two novel p-type BDT-quinoxaline based push–pull polymers, PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2 (Fig. 1), in which the BDT core unit was substituted with either 2-octylthienyl (-TR1) or 2,3-dihexylthienyl (-T2R2), respectively, as side groups. Since the polymers have similar molecular structures, the comparison between them will provide useful information on the influence of the alkyl side chain(s) of the 2D-conjugated structure on the resulting optical, morphological and electrical properties. Solution-processed BHJ solar cells, using PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2 as electron donor materials and PC61BM (or PC71BM) as an electron acceptor counterpart, were fabricated in air by a blade-coating technique. PCEs of ∼5.7% and ∼3.4% have been achieved for PFQBDT-TR1:PC61BM and PFQBDT-T2R2:PC61BM based devices, respectively, highlighting how the architecture of the alkyl portion of the π-conjugated side segment (thiophene ring) plays a determining role in polymer self-assembly in thin-films and can influence the resulting optoelectronic properties of these BDT-quinoxaline based copolymers.

2 Experimental section
2.1 General remarks
5,8-Bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-6,7-difluoro-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline (7) was prepared according to previously reported procedures.11g,12 Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried over Na/benzophenone and freshly distilled prior to use. Other reagents and solvents were of commercial grade and used as received without further purification. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were acquired from a Varian Inova 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. Tetramethylsilane was used as an internal reference with deuterated chloroform as a solvent. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on a Waters Alliance GPCV2000 with a refractive index detector, with columns: Waters Styragel® HT 6E×1 and Waters Styragel® HMW 6E×2. The eluent was 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, the working temperature was 135 °C, and the dissolution time was 2 hours. The concentration of the samples was 0.5 mg mL−1, which were filtered (filter: 0.45 μm) prior to the analysis. The relative molecular masses were calculated by calibration relative to polystyrene standards. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer Lambda 900 UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrometer.
Square-wave voltammetry (SWV) measurements were carried out on a CH-Instruments 650A Electrochemical Workstation. A three-electrode setup was used with platinum wires both as a working electrode and a counter electrode, and Ag/Ag+ was used as a reference electrode calibrated with Fc/Fc+. A 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in anhydrous acetonitrile was used as a supporting electrolyte. The polymers were deposited onto the working electrode from chloroform solution. In order to remove oxygen from the electrolyte, the system was bubbled with nitrogen prior to each experiment. The nitrogen inlet was then moved above the liquid surface and left there during the scans. HOMO and LUMO levels were deduced from their respective ionization potentials and electron affinities, estimated from peak potentials of the third scan by setting the oxidative peak potential of Fc/Fc+vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) to 0.63 V and the NHE vs. the vacuum level to 4.5 V.15
2.2 OPV device fabrication and characterization
All materials, PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate), Clevios P VP A1 4083, H. C. Starck), PC61BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, Solenne BV) (or PC71BM) and various anhydrous solvents (Sigma-Aldrich) were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. Patterned ITO-coated glasses (Rs ∼ 10 Ω □−1) were cleaned in sequential sonicating baths (for 15 min) of deionized water, acetone and isopropanol. After the final sonication step, substrates were dried with a stream of N2 gas and then placed in an oxygen plasma chamber for 10 min. Next, a thin layer (∼30 nm) of PEDOT:PSS was spun-cast on the ITO surface and subsequently annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. The active layer blend solutions were formulated inside the glove box and stirred overnight at 80 °C. For optimized devices, a total concentration of 30 mg mL−1 in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) was used for both donors. The blend solutions were deposited under ambient conditions by blade-coating on top of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS surface. Before cathode deposition, the substrates were then either thermally annealed or left as-cast. To complete the device fabrication, LiF and Al (0.6 nm and 100 nm) were deposited sequentially without breaking vacuum (∼3 × 10−6 Torr) using a thermal evaporator directly connected to the glove box. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of all OPV devices were recorded by a Keithley 236 source-measure unit under a simulated AM1.5 G illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (Abet Technologies Sun 2000 Solar Simulator). The light intensity was determined by a calibrated silicon solar cell fitted with a KG5 color glass filter to bring spectral mismatch to unity. The active area of the solar cell was exactly 6 mm2. During testing, each cell was carefully masked, by a calibrated mask, to prevent an excess photocurrent generated from the parasitic device regions outside the overlapped electrodes area. All solar cells were tested inside the glove box in an oxygen and moisture free environment. External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) was measured outside the glove-box with a home-built system on encapsulated devices. Monochromatic light was obtained with a xenon arc lamp from Lot-Oriel (300 Watt power) coupled with a Spectra-Pro monochromator. The photocurrent produced by the device passed through a calibrated resistance (50 Ω) and the voltage drop signal was collected through the resistance with a Lock-In Digital Amplifier-SR830. The signal was pulsed by means of an optical chopper (∼300 Hz frequency). A calibrated silicon photodiode was used as a reference.
2.3 Thin-film characterization
All thin-film characterizations were performed in air. Solution and film optical absorption spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-550 spectrophotometer. The thickness of the various films was measured by a profilometer (KLA Tencor, P-6). All active films were characterized on glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates and subsequently corrected for the background signal, in order to reproduce the effective condition and the real nanomorphology of the active layer. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images were taken with a Solver Pro (NT-934 MDT) scanning probe microscope in tapping mode. The AFM images were recorded directly on tested devices.
The crystallinity of PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2 films was investigated by Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXRD) measurements performed at the ELETTRA-XRD1 beamline at Trieste's synchrotron facility (Italy) using a monochromatic beam with a wavelength (λ) of 1 Å and a dimension of 0.2 × 0.2 (H × V) mm2. The incident angle of the X-ray beam, αi, was chosen slightly larger than the critical angle for the total reflection of the organic film (∼0.12°), in order to penetrate through the full film depth. The diffraction patterns were recorded using a 2D camera (Pilatus detector) placed normal to the incident beam direction. The PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2 films, characterized by GIXRD, were prepared by blade-coating semiconductor solutions in ODCB (15 and 10 mg mL−1, respectively) on pre-cleaned Si/SiO2 substrates. The thickness of the resulting films was estimated to be ∼180 nm for PFQBDT-TR1 and ∼100 nm for PFQBDT-T2R2.
The hole mobility of the photosensitive layers was measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC)16 method using devices with structure: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC61BM/Au. The processing conditions used for the active layers were the optimized ones. Charge mobility was extracted by fitting the current density–voltage curves, recorded under dark conditions, to the Mott–Gurney equation.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis of monomers and polymers
Polymers PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2 are shown in Fig. 1 and were synthesized as reported in Scheme 1. 5,8-Bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-6,7-difluoro-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline (7) was prepared according to previously reported procedures,11g,12 while the other comonomers were synthesized, purified and characterized as described in the ESI.†

Briefly, the BDT monomers ((4,8-bis(5-octylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (3) and (4,8-bis(4,5-dihexylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (6)) were synthesized following the reaction sequences shown in Scheme 1.
2-Octylthiophene (1) or 2,3-dihexyl thiophene (4) was lithiated with n-BuLi to which benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione was added and the intermediate compounds formed were reduced with SnCl2.2H2O in 10% HCl to afford compounds 2 and 5 with 65% yield. The distannylated BDT monomers 3 and 6 were obtained from compounds 2 and 5 by a stepwise reaction that involves lithiation by n-butyllithium followed by quenching with trimethyltin chloride of the lithiated species. Monomer 3 was purified by recrystallization from the isopropanol–THF mixture while compound 6 was purified by recrystallization from ethanol and isopropanol.
Polymers PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2 were synthesized12via Stille cross-coupling reaction in toluene using tris(dibenzylideneacetone)-dipalladium(0) (Pd2(dba)3) and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (P(o-Tolyl)3) as the catalyst.11g,12 The resulting polymers were precipitated in methanol, collected by filtration and purified by Soxhlet extraction, using different organic solvents, to remove impurities and/or low molecular weight fractions. The remaining part was extracted with chloroform. The purified polymers exhibit comparable molar masses (MN and MW), determined by high temperature GPC, as summarized in Table 1. In addition, both polymers exhibit good solubility in chlorinated solvents for device fabrication (e.g., ≥10 mg mL−1 in ODCB) thanks to the presence of several alkyl side chains linked to the different structural units.

3.2 Optical, electrochemical and nanostructural properties of polymers
The optical absorption spectra of the pristine polymers PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2 in dilute chloroform solutions and thin-films are displayed in Fig. 2. The detailed absorption data, including absorption maxima in solution and film, as well as the corresponding onset and bandgap values are summarized in Table 1. In general, the polymers exhibit relatively broad absorption spectra, which indicates that a significant part of the solar spectral flux is absorbed, contributing to photocurrent generation.
 Fig. 2  UV-Vis absorption spectra, normalized to the absorption maxima, of pristine polymers in: (A) dilute ODCB solutions and (B) thin-films (deposited on glass from ODCB solution). 
Both materials exhibit high energy absorption bands due to the π–π* transition with a low-energy band arising from the intramolecular charge-transfer-like interactions, between the donor (BDT) and acceptor (FQ) moieties,17 and from the intermolecular interactions between the polymer chains. However, the significantly different absorption profiles (Fig. 2) of PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2, despite their similar molecular structure, suggest a strong influence of the alkyl side chains on the intra- and inter-molecular interactions, both in solution and solid state.
In the solution absorption spectra of polymers PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2 (Fig. 2A) an evident red shift (by 52 nm) of the λmax of PFQBDT-TR1versus that of PFQBDT-T2R2 is observed (615 nm versus 563 nm, respectively). On the other hand, very similar λmax are observed in the solid state spectra of the two polymers (Fig. 2B), due to their different spectral shapes, indicating a different aggregation behavior (vide infra). In particular, a broader spectrum is registered for PFQBDT-TR1 compared to PFQBDT-T2R2, in the longer wavelength region (∼700 nm). As a result, the absorption onset values (λonset) for PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2 films are ∼730 nm and 700 nm, from which the resulting optical gaps (Eoptgap) are estimated to be ∼1.70 and 1.77 eV, respectively.
The thin-film spectra of PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2 are significantly broadened and red-shifted relative to the solution spectra. Considering the absorption onsets (λonset), the resulting red shift magnitude (Δλonset = λfilmonset − λsolonset) drastically increases proceeding from PFQBDT-TR1 to PFQBDT-T2R2 (Δλonset = 16 nm and 62 nm, respectively), likely due to enhanced intra- and inter-molecular interactions as a function of the alkyl side chain substitution on the thiophene rings.18,14d
As shown in Fig. 1, PFQBDT-TR1 has linear octyl (–C8H17) side chains linked to the thiophene side group which play a role in improving the solubility of the polymer, without determining a significant steric hindrance or side chain congestion with the adjacent octyloxy (–OC8H17) substituent of the quinoxaline unit. As a consequence, we can assume that PFQBDT-TR1 adopts a more favorable planar conformation, which could be responsible for a partial pre-aggregation of the polymer backbone in solution, in agreement with the relatively small Δλonset for PFQBDT-TR1 (16 nm) passing from solution to thin-film.
Diversely, in PFQBDT-T2R2 the two n-hexyl side chains linked to the thiophene side groups could sterically interact with the adjacent octyloxy (–OC8H17) chains of the quinoxaline units. In order to minimize the side chain congestion and thus the conformational energy of the polymer backbone, we can suppose that PFQBDT-T2R2 adopts a conformation where the side chains are placed away from each other, probably determining a partial twisting of the polymer backbone. This twisting, as expected, is stronger in solution, where the intermolecular interactions are relatively low, while in the solid state the polymer chains will be forced to adopt a more planar conformation, similar to the analogous derivative PFQBDT-TR1. As a result, the partial planarization of the PFQBDT-T2R2 backbone in the thin-film, induced by the stronger π–π interchain interactions, is reflected in a drastically red-shifted onset (Δλonset = 62 nm).
Note that, despite the aggregation tendency of both polymers, thus resulting in a similar behavior in the solid state, they still exhibit different film absorption spectra (λonset (PFQBDT-TR1) − λonset (PFQBDT-T2R2) = 30 nm), suggesting a different self-organization of the polymer chains, as supported by additional morphological and electrical investigations of PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2 based films.
To gain deeper insight into the molecular packing within the polymer films, 2D-GIXRD images of PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2 films were collected and are reported in Fig. 3A and B, respectively. Both of them show a broad peak along the out-of-plane direction (qz lying in the 1.6–1.7 Å−1 range), corresponding to the π-stacking reflection (010) which suggests an orientation of the polymer backbone parallel to the substrate.
 Fig. 3  2D-GIXRD images of (A) PFQBDT-TR1 and (B) PFQBDT-T2R2 films. All images have the same intensity log-scale. Scattering intensity integrated along (C) the Yoneda and (D) the specular direction (qxy ∼ 0). 
This “face-on” orientation is beneficial for the charge transport in the OPV device, and the effect is enhanced by reducing the π–π stacking distance (d010) between the backbones.19 Interestingly, the distance d010, extracted from the out-of-plane scattering intensity profile (Fig. 3C), is ∼3.7 Å and ∼3.9 Å for PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2, respectively, confirming a more cohesive solid-state molecular packing for the PFQBDT-TR1 polymer in agreement with the red-shifted absorption profile, enhanced charge mobility and photovoltaic properties. Moreover, the (010) peak intensity coming from the PFQBDT-TR1 film (normalized for the thickness) is higher than the other one, indicating a larger amount of crystalline domains for PFQBDT-TR1.
The in-plane scattering intensity profiles, reported in Fig. 3D, show two Bragg peaks at qxy ∼0.26 Å−1 and qxy ∼0.66 Å−1 for both polymers. Since the unit cells of these polymers are not known, peaks were index-linked on the base of polymer dimensions. The first peak, labeled as (100), is related to the distance of the lamellar spacing (d100) along the in-plane direction, which depends on the side chain packing, and it is slightly smaller for the hexyl (R2) derivative PFQBDT-T2R2 (dls = ∼ 22.0 Å) than for the octyl (R1) analogous PFQBDT-TR1 (dls = ∼24.5 Å). The second in-plane Bragg peak (002) corresponds to a distance of ∼9.7 Å, which is in agreement with the half value of the chain backbone repeat distance calculated using ChemBio3. The (001) peak should be hidden from the (100) peak.
SWV was employed to examine the electrochemical properties and estimate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers from the oxidation and reduction peak values (Fig. S1†), respectively. The resulting values are summarized in Table 1. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PFQBDT-TR1 were estimated to be – 5.89 and – 3.61 eV, respectively, while those of PFQBDT-T2R2 are – 5.87 and – 3.63 eV, respectively. The deep HOMO energies of both polymers suggest that a high VOC should be achievable when PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2 are combined with PC61BM or PC71BM in BHJ OPV devices, according to the difference E(LUMOACCEPTOR) − E(HOMODONOR).9b,c In addition, the electrochemically derived HOMO energies are in an ideal range to ensure a good air stability of the polymers.20,9a Considering that the LUMO level of the typical electron acceptors PC61BM and PC71BM is located at – 4.03 and – 4.13 eV respectively,21 the LUMO offset between the donor and acceptor (ΔELUMO: E(LUMODONOR) − E(LUMOACCEPTOR)) should provide the driving force for an efficient exciton dissociation.22 Finally, it should be reminded that no significant difference in the electrochemically determined HOMO and LUMO energy levels, thus in the resulting energy gap, was seen for the two polymers, likely due to the low sensitivity of this technique to the aggregation effects.18

In order to investigate the impact of the alkyl side chains on the photovoltaic properties of PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2, we prepared BHJ solar cells using PC61BM (or PC71BM) as an acceptor (A) counterpart. A conventional device configuration, glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al, was employed. The active blends were deposited by blade-coating in air dry ODCB solutions, and notably the most efficient OPV solar cell was produced without the need for processing solvent additives. Further details for the device fabrication and characterization are given in the Experimental section. Table 2 and S1† summarize the photovoltaic response data including VOC, JSC, FF and PCE. The OPV responses of PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2 based solar cells are dependent on the blend composition, since the tuning of the D–A blend ratio is pivotal to reach the best compromise between the light harvesting, charge carrier transport as well as ideal morphology in the bulk heterojunction, thus minimizing the loss mechanisms.23 The optimal D–A ratio was found to be 1:1 (wt/wt) for PFQBDT-TR1 and 1:2 (wt/wt) for PFQBDT-T2R2. Upon increasing or decreasing the donor content in the active blends, a significant drop in JSC, VOC, or FF was observed, resulting in lower PCEs. Several unsuccessful attempts to optimize the OPV performance of the devices were carried out, for instance by using different annealing temperatures and times, a processing solvent additive (1,8-diiodooctane, DIO) and PC71BM as an alternative acceptor (Table 2 and S1†).

OPV current density–voltage (J–V) plots, under standard illumination, for the most efficient solar cells based on PFQBDT-TR1:PC61BM and PFQBDT-T2R2:PC61BM (D–A wt/wt ratio of 1:1 and 1:2, respectively) active blends are shown in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  
J–V plot, under standard illumination, of the best performing solar cells based on as-cast 1:1 (wt/wt) PFQBDT-TR1:PC61BM (red) and annealed 1:2 (wt/wt) PFQBDT-T2R2:PC61BM films (blue). 
The most efficient BHJ cells exhibit interesting photovoltaic responses with PCEs of 5.7% and 3.4%, respectively for as-cast 1:1 (wt/wt) PFQBDT-TR1:PC61BM and annealed 1:2 (wt/wt) PFQBDT-T2R2:PC61BM active blends. In particular, the PFQBDT-TR1 based solar cell exhibits JSC = 11.1 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.84 V and FF = 61%, while the PFQBDT-T2R2 based device shows JSC = 6.5 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.96 V and FF = 54%. By comparing the resulting OPV characteristic, the main difference is represented by the JSC and VOC values, which exhibit an opposite trend passing from PFQBDT-TR1 to PFQBDT-T2R2.
The PFQBDT-TR1 based solar cell yields a current density of 11 mA cm−2, almost the double of that of the corresponding PFQBDT-T2R2 based device (6.5 mA cm−2), in agreement with the different optical properties, both in pristine or blended films (Fig. 2 and 5), and molecular packing of the polymer chains (Fig. 3). The absorption spectra of the optimized active blends (Fig. 5A) present a similar trend observed for pristine materials. Indeed, despite less pronounced differences, the PFQBDT-TR1:PC61BM blend exhibits a broader and more defined absorption profile in the red portion of the spectrum, between 630 nm and 700 nm, suggesting enhanced π–π interchain interactions, in agreement with improved charge transport properties, as supported by electrical and morphological investigations.

By comparing the average value of VOC (VavOC) for each polymer:PC61BM based solar cell, estimated from the open-circuit voltages observed at different D–A w/w ratios (Table 2), an increase in VavOC by ∼0.15 V is observed passing from PFQBDT-TR1 to PFQBDT-T2R2. In particular, the best performing PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2 based solar cells exhibit a VOC of 0.84 V and 0.96 V, respectively. This variation, despite the nearly identical electrochemically derived HOMO and LUMO energy levels (Table 1), could be ascribed to the effect of the side-chain architecture on the film-forming properties of the polymers, as supported by AFM images (Fig. 6), likely influencing the exciton stabilization and dissociation, the D–A aggregation and interfacial energetics, all factors that are known to strongly affect the VOC.24,10d This correlates well with our hypothesis that PFQBDT-TR1, compared to PFQBDT-T2R2, adopts a more planar conformation which promotes the generation of different and relatively more ordered and well-organized domains, in perfect agreement with the GIXRD patterns, red-shifted absorption spectra and enhanced charge mobility, FF and JSC values of PFQBDT-TR1 based films. As mentioned, the hole mobility (estimated by the space charge limited current (SCLC)16 method, Fig. S2†) of the optimized as-cast 1:1 (wt/wt) PFQBDT-TR1:PC61BM film resulted to be one order of magnitude higher compared to that of the annealed 1:2 (wt/wt) PFQBDT-T2R2:PC61BM blend (2 × 10−4 and 4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively), in agreement with the higher JSC and FF values (61% and 54%, respectively), which confirm a closer π–π stacking and ordering of PFQBDT-TR1 polymer backbones. Note that, the relatively low mobility of PFQBDT-T2R2 based films justifies the reduced thickness (∼65 nm) required to optimize the photovoltaic responses of the resulting solar cells (Table 2).

The EQE spectra of the best performing PFQBDT-TR1:PC61BM and PFQBDT-T2R2:PC61BM based devices, as shown in Fig. 5B, have spectral features which are consistent with the corresponding blend absorption spectra (Fig. 5A), with a higher value for the PFQBDT-TR1 based blend compared to the PFQBDT-T2R2 based one. In particular, the EQE profiles of PFQBDT-TR1:PC61BM and PFQBDT-T2R2:PC61BM films showed maximum values of 65% (at 600 nm) and 50% (at 435 nm), respectively, corresponding to the relative absorption maxima of the blend. Convolution of these spectra with the AM1.5G solar spectrum gives calculated short circuit current density in good agreement, within a ∼5% experimental error, with that obtained from J–V measurements (Table 2 and Fig. 4).
It is well known that the nanomorphology of the BHJ active layer plays an important role in determining the OPV performance. In order to gain a deeper understanding on how the side chain architecture of polymers PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2 affects the solar cell output parameters, we investigated the morphological differences of optimized PFQBDT-TR1:PC61BM and PFQBDT-T2R2:PC61BM blend films by tapping-mode AFM.

Fig. 6 shows topographic images of the best performing BHJ cells based on as-cast 1:1 (wt/wt) PFQBDT-TR1:PC61BM and annealed 1:2 (wt/wt) PFQBDT-T2R2:PC61BM blends. The surface morphology of the resulting films is significantly different with morphological features that correlate well with the previous results. In particular, the topographic image of the as-cast 1: 1 (wt/wt) PFQBDT-TR1:PC61BM film is characterized by a well defined and structured surface (Root Mean Square, RMS, of ∼5 nm) with reduced domain size suggesting the generation of an optimal phase separation between the BHJ components combined with the formation of more ordered and aggregated polymeric domains, as discussed above.
Diversely, despite the additional thermal treatment, the AFM image of annealed 1:2 (wt/wt) PFQBDT-T2R2:PC61BM exhibits a smooth and almost featureless surface (RMS of ∼1 nm) with quite large and poorly defined domains indicating a suboptimal phase segregation of the D–A blend.
Thus, poorly formed percolation pathways lead to limited charge transport and/or collection processes within the active blends, as confirmed by the low charge mobility, FF, and PCEs obtained from the corresponding BHJ films. This result correlates well with the above mentioned hypothesis on the twisting of the PFQBDT-T2R2 backbone which might partially hinder π–π interchain interactions, resulting in relatively more disordered and disaggregated domains.
Conclusions
In summary, two novel p-type quinoxaline-benzodithiophene copolymers, PFQBDT-TR1 and PFQBDT-T2R2, have been designed, synthesized, and characterized. We found that the alkyl substitution on the aromatic side group of the polymers significantly influences the intra- and inter-molecular interactions and thus the optical, morphological and electrical properties of the resulting films. In particular, polymer PFQBDT-TR1, containing a single linear octyl (R1, –C8H17) side chain on the thiophene rings, seems to adopt a more planar backbone conformation, compared to PFQBDT-T2R2, which promotes the formation of aggregated and well-organized domains in blend films, in perfect agreement with the red-shifted absorption spectra, enhanced charge mobility, FF and JSC of the corresponding devices. In contrast, the two hexyl (R2, –C6H13) side chains on thienyl groups of PFQBDT-T2R2 can sterically hinder the adjacent quinoxaline unit inducing a backbone twisting which can be responsible for the different nanostructural order, blue-shifted absorption profiles and reduced electrical properties of the resulting thin films. Finally, while the PCE of the best performing PFQBDT-T2R2 based device is 3.4%, with JSC = 6.5 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.96 V and FF = 54%, the optimized PFQBDT-TR1 based cell exhibits ∼2 times improved PCE. In particular, the BHJ solar cell based on the 1:1 (wt/wt) PFQBDT-TR1:PC61BM blend showed a PCE of 5.7% with VOC, JSC, and FF of 0.84 V, 11.1 mA cm−2, and 61%, respectively. Notably, all OPV devices were fabricated under ambient conditions by the blade-coating technique.
