    , Accepted 20th June 2019First published on 2nd July 2019AbstractIodine-rich mixed composition metal–halide perovskites were developed to improve the performance of perovskite solar cell devices incorporating tin(IV) oxide substrates for electron transport layers by optimizing the I/Br halide ion ratio. Device performance was further enhanced by exposing to ambient atmosphere over several days, which correlated with a shift of the energy levels in the perovskite and significant suppression of charge carrier recombination. A high power conversion efficiency of 20.6% was obtained for the aged device.
Introduction
Metal halide perovskites are promising materials for cost-effective printable photovoltaics. Perovskite solar cells with 3.8% power conversion efficiency (PCE) were reported in 2009 by Miyasaka et al.,1 and in just one decade efficiencies have reached 23%.2 The most widely studied perovskite architype is methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3). The use of purified starting materials, in combination with careful optimization of the perovskite fabrication methods, have led to significant improvements in PCE,2,3 stability and reproducibility of MAPbI3-based photovoltaic devices.4–10 The efficiencies of MAPbI3-based devices are currently around 20%.11–17 Replacing or mixing different cation and anion species in the perovskite lattice often changes the band gap and shifts the charge transporting energy levels, leading to additional device performance.18–24 Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), for example, is expected to show improved light harvesting owing to its narrower band gap compared with MAPbI3. However, FAPbI3 undergoes a spontaneous phase transition at room temperature from the photo-active black α-phase perovskite to the photo-inactive yellow δ-phase non-perovskite, making pure FAPbI3 devices less stable.18,25,26 Fortuitously, Seok et al. found that the stability of the α-phase FAPbI3 was increased by adding a small amount of MAPbBr3 into the FAPbI3 to form a mixed composition perovskite.22 After their work, a variety of perovskites with mixed compositions were developed, and this has grown rapidly into an exciting new trend in perovskite solar cell research. As a recent example, a cesium-containing mixed component perovskite, Cs0.05MA0.16FA0.79PbI2.49Br0.51, was developed by Saliba et al., which further improves the stability of the α-phase FAPbI3.23 Rubidium24 and potassium27 ions have been used instead of, or in combination with, cesium ions. Solar cells made with these mixed compositions have high efficiencies and good thermal durability, and as a result have come into widespread use as standard perovskite materials.
For the perovskites developed for present work, FAPbI3 derived from FAPbI3·2DMF complex is used as a purified source of FAI and PbI2 for perovskites with mixed FA–MA cations. These stable, pure materials provide FAI:PbI2 components in an exact 1:1 stoichiometry.
The ion ratios of mixed composition perovskites were adjusted to maximize the performance of solar cells. In particular, our interest in the current work is improving the current output of devices using tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) films as electron transport layers. Recently, SnO2 has become a popular electron transport layer (ETL), since, unlike titanium(IV) oxide (TiO2), the films can be grown under low temperature conditions (∼150 °C).28–30 The efficiency of these SnO2-based devices have tended to be lower than those using mesoporous-TiO2, although a more efficient example has recently been reported.31 We predict that by optimizing the composition of mixed perovskites to tune the electronic levels slightly, it should be possible to optimally match the conduction bands of the perovskite with SnO2 for efficient electron extraction. Varying the ion substitution ratio of I and Br led to the development of a new narrow band gap mixed-component perovskite formulation, Cs0.05FA0.80MA0.15PbI2.75Br0.25 (I/Br ratio 11:1), ideally suited to interface with SnO2 transport layers.
Mixed composition materials are known to benefit from annealing at higher temperatures than typically used for MAPbI3, with 150 °C considered optimal.29 At this temperature, excess PbI2 forms on the surface as a result of the partial decomposition of the perovskite.30 PbI2 is thought to play a key role in reducing defects in the perovskite film, suppressing the charge carrier recombination processes.32–34 We confirmed that when the perovskite films were annealed at 150 °C for 5 min or more, PbI2 gradually appeared on the surface, and that the presence of PbI2 was found to directly correlate with improvements in the electrical performance of the device. Furthermore, aging in ambient atmosphere (25% relative humidity; RH) for 4–5 days caused a dramatic improvement in device efficiency together with a reduction in the hysteresis of the J–V curves. Aging shifted the conduction and valence energy levels in the perovskite layer, and supressed charge carrier recombination in the devices. After aging, highly reproducible solar cells were readily obtained with high output currents and high power conversion efficiencies (maximum 20.6%).
Results and discussion
Preparation of FAPbI3·2DMF complex and derivatives
FAPbI3·2DMF complex was obtained by multi-solvent recrystallization in an N2-filled glovebox, in a similar manner to MAPbI3·DMF.35,36 FAI and PbI2 (1:1) were dissolved in dry DMF at 70 °C, and the resulting clear yellow solution was transferred to a glass tube. Toluene was layered over the DMF solution, and colorless crystals of FAPbI3·2DMF were collected after one day. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed that the DMF molecules are intercalated between the octahedral layer of [PbI3]− moieties and the FA+ cations (Fig. 1a). Solvent loss was meanwhile examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results for FAPbI3·2DMF are shown in Fig. 1b. Weight loss began at 50 °C and completed by 200 °C. Over that time, the crystals changed from colorless to black. The total weight loss was 19.2%, while the calculated loss for the removal of two DMF molecules from the structural formula is 18.8%. The product obtained by heating at high temperature is therefore concluded to be FAPbI3. FAPbI3·2DMF has good solubility compared with conventional mixture of FAI and PbI2. FAPbI3·2DMF dissolves in DMSO in a few minutes at room temperature, more quickly than the corresponding mixture of FAI and PbI2 (Fig. 1c). Based on trace analysis of 70 elements, the purity of FAPbI3·2DMF was determined to be 99.998% (Fig. S1†), a high value similar to our previously developed purified precursors PbI2 and MAPbI3·DMF.35,37,38

When the FAPbI3·2DMF crystals were washed with toluene and dried under vacuum, the colorless complex took on a yellow tint. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis indicated that the integral ratio of FA+:DMF was now 1:1 (Fig. S2†), while thermogravimetric analysis of the yellow crystalline solids confirmed that the weight loss corresponded to one molecule of DMF (Fig. S3†). About half of the solvent molecules were therefore eliminated from FAPbI3·2DMF over the course of the washing and drying procedure. Although it is unclear if this solvent ratio is homogenous over the entire crystal, the same 1:1 ratio of FA+:DMF was confirmed over multiple lots using 1H NMR analysis. The dried material was therefore assigned to the nominal formula FAPbI3·DMF. While this reagent is stable and provides the source of purified FA+ for the precursor solutions used in the present work, the remaining intercalated solvent can be removed by drying the complex at 60 °C under vacuum for several days, to give FAPbI3 as a yellow crystalline solid (δ-phase). The absence of DMF was again confirmed by 1H NMR analysis (Fig. S4†). This material is also an excellent precursor for FA-containing mixed composition perovskites, as an alternative to the solvent-intercalated FAPbI3·DMF (Fig. S5, Table S1.†) FAPbI3 is stable to long term storage in inert atmosphere (Fig. S4b†), in contrast to FAI (Fig. S6†).
Iodine-rich mixed composition perovskite with narrow optical gap for SnO2 ETL-based solar cells
Solar cells made with the mixed composition perovskite, Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16PbI2.49Br0.51, were previously reported to show high efficiency as well as good durability when used in a standard solar cell device with compact-TiO2/mesoporous-TiO2 ETLs.23 When we attempted to use this composition in devices where the TiO2 layer was replaced with SnO2, the current density of the device was limited to about 20 mA cm−2.39 We therefore began adjusting the composition of perovskites to optimize the energy levels for better compatibility with SnO2, which has a lower conduction band energy compared to TiO2 (TiO2 −4.02 eV, SnO2 −4.17 eV).40,41 Somewhat smaller perovskite band gaps should therefore be permissible when using SnO2 as the electron transport layer. The band gap of Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16PbI2.49Br0.51 is approximately 1.6 eV, so a narrower gap is expected to increase the device current and the PCE according to the Shockley–Queisser limit.42 The band gap of the mixed composition perovskite was adjusted and optimized by varying the I/Br ratio, while keeping the ratio of Cs, MA, and FA approximately constant.
The devices were prepared with the structure: glass-ITO/SnO2 (40 nm)/perovskite/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) (200 nm)/Au (80 nm), following the description in the literature.39 Perovskite and HTL layers were fabricated in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Perovskite precursor solutions were prepared from CsI, MABr, PbBr2, PbI2, and FAI or FAPbI3·DMF dissolved in DMF:DMSO 3:1 mixed solvent. FAPbI3·DMF was used as the purified FA+ source. The precursor solutions were deposited on SnO2-coated ITO substrates by spin-coating. While spinning, chlorobenzene antisolvent was dripped over the substrate to induce precipitation of the perovskite precursor. The precursor films were annealed on a hot plate at 150 °C. The transition to perovskite is accompanied by a color change in the film from dark-brown to black. The annealing time has a complicated influence of the film morphology, composition, and device performance. As will be shown later, the optimal annealing time was found to be 10 minutes. Four different mixed composition perovskite formulations were evaluated in order to find which I/Br ratio was most suitable to use with SnO2: Cs0.05FA0.78MA0.12PbI2.49Br0.51 (I:Br = 5:1), Cs0.06FA0.84MA0.10PbI2.59Br0.41 (I:Br = 6:1), Cs0.05FA0.80MA0.15PbI2.75Br0.25 (I:Br = 11:1), and iodine-only Cs0.05FA0.80MA0.15PbI3 (I:Br = 1:0). The current–voltage (J–V) curves and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the best devices are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively, and summarized in Table 1 together with the average values from three cells of each composition. The short circuit current, JSC, increased from 20.8 mA cm−2 (I:Br = 5:1), to 22.0 mA cm−2 (I:Br = 6:1), and 23.3 mA cm−2 (I:Br = 11:1) as the fraction of iodide ions increased. This was accompanied by a decrease in the open circuit voltage, VOC, however, leaving the PCE almost constant at around 18.5%. The short circuit current fell slightly to 22.9 mA cm−2 for the all-iodine composition (I:Br = 1:0), leading to a lower PCE of 17.4%. The unexpected drop in Jsc can be attributed to poor film morphology, as these perovskites did not exhibit the same smooth, shiny surface as the other samples (Fig. S7†). The IPCE spectra confirmed that the increase in JSC corresponds to a change of the perovskite bandgap. The onset of photo-conversion shifted from 780 nm to 815 nm with increasing iodide content in direct consequence of the narrower optical gap. As the composition with the highest PCE, the perovskite Cs0.05FA0.80MA0.15PbI2.75Br0.25 (I:Br = 11:1), was selected for further process optimization of the SnO2 ETL-based solar cell devices.

Neutron activation analysis of the perovskite composition
For mixed composition perovskites, there is always a concern that the perovskite might have a different composition from a concentration ratio of the precursor solution. It is therefore important to confirm the composition ratio in the perovskite film prepared by the above method. Since the heavy elements Cs, I, and Br ions cannot be easily observed by NMR spectroscopy, we instead confirmed the I/Br ratio in the sample prepared using the purified FAPbI3·DMF complex by neutron activation analysis (NAA) at the Kyoto University Reactor (KUR) facility (additional information given in the ESI†). The estimated composition was Cs0.08(FA + MA)0.92PbI2.78Br0.22, in close agreement with the component ratio of the precursor solution, Cs0.05FA0.80MA0.15PbI2.75Br0.25. The I/Br ratio is comparable to the ratio of the precursor solution used to prepare the perovskite samples.
Annealing optimization for iodide-rich mixed component Cs0.05FA0.80MA0.15PbI2.75Br0.25 perovskites
The mixed composition perovskites were generally found to be relatively easy materials to work with at the spin-coating stage. Using the solvent engineering method with antisolvent dripping, flat and smooth films were readily obtained on SnO2-covered ITO substrates. Since the wet film fabrication process seemed to already be broadly effective, we focused instead on optimizing the thermal annealing step. We investigated the effect of the annealing time on the quantity of PbI2 that formed on the perovskite layer and measured the corresponding change in device performance for solar cells prepared under the same conditions. Fig. 3 shows the top-view SEM images of the perovskite films annealed at 150 °C for between 10 s and 120 min. The as-spun precursor film has a granular morphology (Fig. 3a). After a very short annealing time of approximately 10 s, the film changed to a flat and tightly packed layer (Fig. 3b). As seen in Fig. 3c–g, the quantity of high brightness material increased with annealing time. This material was confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis to be PbI2 (Fig. S8–S10†). At the early stage of the annealing, within 5 min, only the grain ripening of the main perovskite film was observed, with little or no formation of PbI2. In order to extract significant quantities of PbI2, it is necessary to anneal the film at 150 °C for 5 minutes or more. Next, we confirmed a positive correlation of the device performance with the quantity of the PbI2 formed on the perovskite surface. Devices were prepared with perovskite layers annealed for 1, 5, 10, and 30 min. J–V curves and IPCE spectra are presented in Fig. S11 and Table S2.† The annealing time of 10 min was found to give the best device efficiency, though there was only modest variation between 5 and 30 min.

Aging effects of air-exposed devices
In this section, the aging effect will be discussed using Cs0.05FA0.80MA0.15PbI2.75Br0.25 as the standard mixed component perovskite and 150 °C for 10 min as the optimized annealing method. The passivation effect of excess PbI2 at the perovskite interfaces is widely known,33,34 and it has been shown that air aging under dark conditions improved the charge carrier diffusion length of mixed-halide perovskite films.43 While examining the durability and reproducibility of the solar cells, we noticed that the performance of devices dramatically improved after being stored in the air (25% RH) without encapsulation for 4–5 days. This aging effect is demonstrated in Fig. 4a, showing the J–V curves for the device which exhibited the greatest improvement. The PCE was 14.5% in the fresh state and increased to 20.6% after aging. In contrast, Fig. 4b shows the J–V curves for a device which exhibited a minimal aging effect. The average PCE of 80 devices increased from 16.6 ± 0.9% to 19.1 ± 0.6% (Fig. 4c). The performance results are summarized in Table 2. It should also be noted that hysteresis in the J–V curves becomes negligible after aging (Fig. 4a and b). Although MAPbI3 quickly degrades in humid air to form PbI2, mixed composition perovskites are stable for up to a month in similar conditions.43 While aging effects in mixed composition devices cannot be directly attributed to an increase in the quantity of PbI2 over time, as this is largely set by the annealing conditions, perovskite layers annealed to give significant excess of surface PbI2 gave the best performance after aging. Examining the complex impedance plots of the fresh and aged devices, obtained under AM1.5G and 0 V applied bias (Fig. 4d), both showed near-ideal single semicircular curves, with a small offset at the origin corresponding to the series resistance, Rs, of the device. The size of the semicircle relates to the primary shunt resistance, Rsh, which is generally taken as defining a recombination resistance when the device is measured under strong illumination.44 In the device which showed the most improvement by aging, the recombination resistance increased from 0.8 kΩ to 1.9 kΩ, reflecting the reduction in charge carrier recombination events in the device. While it is well known that the conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD improves on air oxidation,45,46 no indication of a significant series resistance was detected in the complex impedance plot of the fresh device. The improved device performance may instead be framed in terms of the charge extraction efficiency at the interface between the spiro-OMeTAD layer and the perovskite surface, and the influence of the excess PbI2 which formed at that interface during annealing. We speculate that the changes result from water vapour in the air slowly reacting with the PbI2. The average recombination resistance of the 11 tested devices increased as a direct function of the aging time (Fig. 4e). Charge extraction is also influenced by the energy level alignment. We confirmed that after aging, the energy levels of the valence and conduction band of the perovskite layer shifted with respect to the vacuum level. Photoemission spectroscopy (PES) measurements revealed that the valence band of the perovskite increased from −5.56 eV to −5.42 eV, while the band gap remained unchanged (Fig. 4f, S12†).

The internal quantum efficiencies (IQE) and external quantum efficiencies (EQE) as well as reflectance spectra of the best performing cell (PCE = 20.6%) are shown in Fig. 5a. The integrated JSC from the EQE was estimated to be 23.2 mA cm2, comparable with the values obtained in the J–V measurement. The current onset occurred at above 800 nm (<1.55 eV), in close agreement with the optical gap (1.57 eV). The average EQE and IQE over the range of 450–750 nm was 90% and 98%, respectively. Fig. 5b shows the stabilized power output (SPO) and current density of the best performing device over time, recorded at a fixed applied voltage of 0.95 V. A maximum SPO of 20.2% was observed after 30 s recording. Finally, the cross-sectional SEM image is shown in Fig. 5c, confirming that the device fabricated under the optimized conditions produced a flat and dense perovskite layer, with excellent grain morphology.

Conclusions
A new iodine-rich formulation, Cs0.05FA0.80MA0.15PbI2.75Br0.25, (I/Br ratio 11:1) was introduced which gave optimal compatibility with SnO2 electron transport layers. Adjusting the I/Br ratio expanded the absorption region to longer wavelengths. We confirmed that segregation of PbI2 during high temperature annealing improved device performance and we determined the optimal annealing time needed to produce effective quantities of PbI2. The performance of the perovskite solar cells was dramatically and reproducibly enhanced by exposure to ambient atmosphere over several days, and correlated with a shift of the charge transporting energy levels of the perovskite and a significant reduction in charge carrier recombination events. Combining these optimizations – optical gap tuning, optimized annealing time, and device aging – solar cell devices with a high power conversion efficiency up to 20.6% could be reliably obtained.
