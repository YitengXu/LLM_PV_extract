    , Accepted 18th January 2019First published on 18th January 2019AbstractBecause of their advantages, polymer solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most promising candidates for the next generation power source of various wearable and optoelectronic applications. However, the damage caused by washing, which is essential for wearable applications, deteriorates the characteristics of the device and conventional encapsulation barriers. This study developed an encapsulation barrier which prevented moisture permeability even during the washing process, by introducing a SiO2–polymer composite capping layer. The chemical stability imparted by a reaction between SiO2 and Al2O3 can prevent the phase transitions that are the cause of degradation. The proposed encapsulation barrier preserves its physical and chemical properties, such as thickness, roughness, and permeability, after washing. Also, we proposed a real textile-based PSC, which is a profitable wearable device, since it uses the textile itself as a platform. This means that the PSCs are very flexible and can be designed to match energy consumption by controlling the power area. Finally, it was determined that textile-based optoelectronic modules including PSCs, organic light emitting diodes, and the proposed encapsulation barrier exhibited little change in characteristics even after 20 washings with 10 minutes cycles. In addition, the encapsulated device operated stably with a low curvature radius (3 mm) and boasted high reliability. It exhibited no deterioration in properties over 30 days even after being subjected to both bending stress and washing. This work suggests an important direction for the practical realization of wearable optoelectronic devices on real textiles.

Broader context
The realization of a washable textile power source is one of great interest in the wearable device industry. To realize the full potential of textile power sources, not only is a high barrier thin-film encapsulation required, but enhanced aqueous stability, to withstand washing, is also essential. Despite this, most studies have focused on the barrier property in general atmospheric environments. Even when the washability of the barriers has been considered, few works have demonstrated wearable devices with effective operating lifetimes under aqueous environments. In this paper, we report real textile-based washable polymer solar cells for optoelectronic modules, by adopting a new polymeric buffer layer for encapsulation. To avoid the deterioration of polymer solar cells during washing, a SiO2–polymer composite was deliberately inserted in the encapsulation barrier. It is confirmed that the degradation was prevented by the protonation–deprotonation reaction between the SiO2 contained in the SiO2–polymer composite and the ALD deposited Al2O3. The effect of this reaction, which has been theoretically proven, was also experimentally demonstrated in this study. When integrated with polymer solar cells, organic light emitting diodes, and encapsulation barriers on textiles, the washable optoelectronic modules demonstrated a lifetime of over 30 days with periodic washing.

Introduction
With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), textile-based wearable electronics that integrate multi-functional electronic devices into practical clothes have been attracting much attention, both from the market and consumers.1–5 Because wearable devices can generally be operated with low power consumption, textile-based wearable energy harvesting technologies, which produce electric power from the surrounding environment, hold considerable promise for self-powered wearable electronic systems.6–12 For electronic wearable devices, it is essential to supply stable power with continuous operation. However, a conventional secondary battery used as a power source needs to be recharged every time the battery is discharged, which can be troublesome. Also, the battery's bulky and rigid properties can be a great inconvenience to wearable users. These drawbacks could be resolved if a textile-based energy harvester can be substituted for the conventional secondary battery. This would require a textile-based energy harvester that can generate electric power steadily while preserving the outstanding mechanical properties of a practical textile.
Among the various textile-based energy harvesters, textile-based solar cells are considered promising candidates since they can generate the largest electric power per unit volume without pollution.13,14 Various types of wearable solar cells, such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)15,16 and polymer solar cells (PSCs)17–19 have been widely studied. Even though the DSSCs exhibit slightly higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the PSCs, DSSCs typically contain liquid electrolytes that degrade the mechanical properties and the stability of devices.20,21 This presents some limitations in adapting DSSCs to practical clothing. Meanwhile, the PSCs have many advantages when applied to textile-based energy harvesters, including light weight, high flexibility and outstanding mechanical properties, by virtue of a simple laminated structure composed of solid polymer layers.21,22
To use PSCs as a power source for wearable devices, they must provide sufficient power convergence efficiency, and good operational stability even under harsh environments. Recent progress in the development of polymers and design architectures has increased the possibility of meeting efficiency demands for wearable PSCs.23–31 However, the high susceptibility of polymer materials to moisture and oxygen, which leads to deficient device reliability and lifetime, remains a major limitation to the commercialization of wearable PSCs.
To address this problem, many kinds of thin film encapsulation barriers have been developed to efficiently prevent moisture and oxygen permeation under general environments.32–37 Unfortunately, the polymers’ characteristics can be transformed by detergents, or thermodynamic damage, during the washing process.38–42 The polymers used for the light absorption layer in particular can be damaged by high temperature, which causes a decrease in PCE.43,44 However, most studies have just focused on low water vapor transmission rates (WVTRs). Other features (washability, and low process temperature) also need to be considered when designing an encapsulation barrier for wearable devices.
Atomic layer deposited aluminum oxide (ALD-Al2O3), which is widely used in encapsulation barriers to prevent the degradation of polymers, is known to form a nearly pinhole-free film even at low temperature. Unfortunately, in aqueous environments ALD-Al2O3 undergoes deterioration.45–47 This means that conventional encapsulation barriers which do not have difficulty performing in air, may permit serious corrosion during the washing process. Despite this, the stability of encapsulation barriers in aqueous environments is not well characterized yet. The degradation behavior of encapsulation barriers during the washing process needs to be investigated in detail with the goal of preventing this deterioration.
This study provides further insight into the behavior of a textile-based wearable device during the washing process. First, we propose a washable encapsulation barrier that can maintain its characteristics under aqueous environments, by introducing a nano-stratified encapsulation barrier with a SiO2–polymer composite. The barrier was examined using ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM), and it was determined that the phase transition of ALD-Al2O3 was prevented by the chemical reaction between SiO2 and Al2O3.
By adopting the SiO2–polymer composite, the WVTR of the encapsulation barrier was maintained even under aqueous environments due to its high chemical stability. The PSCs with the proposed encapsulation barrier showed superior reliability, exhibiting only 2% degradation even after washing 20 times (for 10 minute cycles).
Finally, we combined organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) with PSCs and demonstrated them together on a practical textile. Since the textile had excellent mechanical properties, the textile-based organic electronic devices operated well under severe bending conditions (up to 3 mm). In addition, the textile-based wearable devices subjected to washing and bending did not exhibit any notable deterioration over 30 days. This prototype optoelectronic module was feasible under lighting conditions a wearable device may be exposed to during a typical daily routine.
Experimental section
Fabrication of the encapsulation barrier
Al2O3 and ZnO were used as materials to form a nano-stratified layer. The two materials were deposited by thermal ALD in a 70 °C chamber. Al2O3 was prepared using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H2O, ZnO was prepared using diethylzinc (DEZ) and H2O. The ALD cycle was composed by 0.2 seconds of precursor (TMA or DEZ) pulse, 10 seconds of N2 purge, 0.2 seconds of reactant (H2O) pulse, and an N2 purge process for 10 seconds. The 30 nm nano-stratified layer was composed of 5 pairs of Al2O3 (3 nm) and ZnO (3 nm).
PVA, Plow,SiO2, and Phigh,SiO2 were used as the polymers, forming the basic structure of the nano-stratified encapsulation barrier, and they were deposited via spin-coating. Plow,SiO2, a cyclo-aliphatic epoxy oligosiloxane resin, was synthesized by the sol–gel method, which is based on 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)ethyl trimethoxysilane (ECTS) and diphenyl silanediol (DPSD)48 and Phigh,SiO2, a SiO2–polymer composite (i-OPTO BC 10, INTECH Nano Materials Co., Ltd, Korea), based on Si:glycidoxy-propyl trimethoxysilane (Si:GPTMS) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was synthesized by the sol–gel method. For the PVA, the polymer layer undergoes a thermal curing process of 70 °C for 10 minutes while the SiO2 polymer (Phigh,SiO2) has 20 minutes curing time. Epoxy oligosiloxane resin (Plow,SiO2) undergoes a UV curing process with I-line UV (λ = 365 nm, optical power density = 20 mW cm−2) for 100 seconds.
PSC fabrication
The PSCs were fabricated on a barrier-coated textile substrate with the following structure: textile substrate/bottom encapsulation barrier/Ag cathode (100 nm)/PFN (electron transporting layer, 8–10 nm)/PTB7-Th:PC71BM (active layer, 100–110 nm)/MoO3 (hole transporting layer, 10 nm)/Ag anode (10 nm)/MoO3 (optical capping layer, 30 nm). At this time, the PSC was designed with a top-illuminated and inverted structure that receives light through the upper electrode, because the textile substrate is opaque. It showed superior stability compared to the conventional structure. For efficient electron injection, poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN, 1-material) was thinly formed on the Ag cathode by spin-coating. In addition, 8 mg mL−1 of poly[4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-4,6-diyl] (PTB7-Th, 1-material) and 12 mg mL−1 of (6,6)-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM, Nano-C) were dissolved in a mixed solvent (chlorobenzene:1,8-diiodoctane (97:3 by volume)) for the active layer. The active layer was deposited by spin-coating at 1000 rpm for 120 seconds. After drying for 30 minutes in a N2 glove box, a transparent DMD (dielectric/metal/dielectric) electrode having a structure of MoO3/Ag/MoO3 was prepared by the thermal evaporation method. All the thermal evaporation was performed at an average vacuum of 1 × 10−6 Torr.
OLED fabrication
The top-emission type OLEDs were fabricated on the barrier-coated textile substrate with the following structure: textile substrate/bottom encapsulation barrier/Al cathode (100 nm)/Liq (1 nm)/Bebq2:Ir(piq)3 (70 nm)/NPB (65 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/Ag anode (30 nm)/NPB (50 nm). The Al cathode and 8-hydroxyquinolinolato-lithium (Liq) were used as an electron-injection layer. The bis(10-hydroxybenzo[h]quinolinato)beryllium complex (Bebq2) and tris(1-phenylisoquinoline)iridium (Ir(piq)3), which is a red emission dopant, were co-deposited for an emitting layer. For the hole-transport layer, N,N′-bis(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine (NPB) was used, while molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) was used for the hole-injection layer. A semi-transparent silver layer with an NPB optical capping layer was used for the anode. The whole layers were made by thermal evaporation with an average vacuum of 1 × 10−6 Torr.
Encapsulation of optoelectronic modules
Finally, 3 dyads of functional encapsulation barrier were fabricated on 60 μm attachable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) containing 3.5 μm PET substrate, 6.5 μm acrylic adhesive (600 gf/25 mm) and 50 μm release liner PET (Fig. S1a, ESI†). The encapsulation barrier is easily attached to the device via acrylic adhesive without an additional curing process since its adhesive force is strong enough not to exfoliate the PET (Fig. S1b and c, ESI†).
The optoelectronic modules fabricated on the textile substrate are simultaneously protected by the attachable encapsulation, which is separated from the release liner PET. For external connection of the optoelectronic modules, the thermally deposited metal electrode of the device and a conductive fiber were connected using a conductive paste. In addition, the external connection between the device electrode and conductive fiber was effectively protected because an attachable encapsulation film was attached over the external connection area.
Characterization
The electrical calcium test utilizing the high reactivity of calcium metal was used to measure WVTR with the following steps. A 100 nm thick Al electrode was thermally evaporated on a glass substrate and then a calcium pad having a thickness of 250 nm was fabricated to have a size of 1.5 cm2 which is the same as the moisture permeation area. Then the calcium pad was sealed using a barrier deposited superstrate with a UV-curable sealant (XNR 5570-Ba, Nagase Chemtex, Japan). The vacuum in the thermal evaporation process was at the level of 1 × 10−6 Torr and all experiments were conducted in a glove box in a N2 environment. Finally, changes in resistance were observed in real time using a sheet resistance measuring device (Keithley 2750, USA) connected in the chamber, which can control and maintain the temperature and humidity. Based on the electrical corrosion of calcium metal generated as the reaction between the calcium metal and moisture and oxygen progresses, WVTR can be calculated as follows.49 (1)where n is the molar equivalent (2 for water), M is the molar mass, δ is the density of calcium, ρ is the resistivity of calcium, l is the length of the calcium pad, w is the width of the calcium pad, and R is the resistance of the calcium pad.
The PL measurement continued using fluorescence spectroscopy (FluoroMate FS-2, SCINCO, Korea) with a 150 W ozone free Xe lamp. The measured sample was fabricated on a glass substrate with a thickness of 30 nm. Next, FT-IR was measured using the attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode of an infrared spectrophotometer (IFS 66 V/S & Hyperion 3000, Bruker, Germany). In the course of the experiment, thickness and surface roughness were measured via the elliptical polarization method (M2000 D, Woollam, USA) and an atomic force microscope (XE-100, Park Systems, Korea) respectively. Samples used for FT-IR, ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy measurements were fabricated on Si wafers.
The electrical characteristics of the fabricated wearable PSCs were measured using a solar simulator (K201 LAB 55, McScience Inc., Korea) via an AM 1.5 G filter of 100 mW cm−2, while a source meter Keithley 2400, USA and a spectrophotometer (CS-2000, Konica Minolta, Japan) were used to measure the characteristics of the OLEDs. Finally, washing experiments were conducted using a neutral liquid detergent (Aquet, Bel-Art, USA) without phosphate, and bending experiments were conducted on a customized bending machine (ST1, Korea).
Result and discussion
Effect and mechanism of hydrolysis of the nano-stratified layer
It is known that PSCs are vulnerable to moisture and oxygen because of the polymer material used as the light absorption layer. PSCs without functional encapsulation no longer work when dipped under water, as shown in Fig. 1a.
 Fig. 1  Effect of dipping into water: (a) J–V curve of PSCs before and after dipping, (b) ellipsometric analysis of the nano-stratified layer; effective thickness and refractive index according to various storage conditions, (c) FT-IR measurements of the nano-stratified layer before and after dipping, and (d) the phase transition mechanism of ALD deposited Al2O3 by H2O. 
A nano-stratified layer composed of ALD-Al2O3 and atomic layer deposited zinc oxide (ALD-ZnO) is currently regarded as one of the next generation encapsulation barriers because of its low WVTR and high flexibility.32,36 Unlike other atomic layer deposited oxide layers (ALD-oxides), the ALD-ZnO layer provides mechanical stability to the nano-stratified barrier through a crack arresting behavior, provided by the Zn etching process.32 Also, DEZ, the precursor of ALD-ZnO, works as a reaction enhancer for ALD-Al2O3 growth because of its hydrophobic surface, which prevents the H2O retention phenomenon.50,51
However, the ZnO layer also contains oxygen vacancies, which occur during deposition.52 Since an oxygen vacancy can provide a diffusion path for external moisture and oxygen, it causes the encapsulation barrier to have a high WVTR. However, a substitution reaction, which eliminates the oxygen vacancy, happens in the nano-stratified layer because of the ALD-Al2O3 layer.
The photoluminescence (PL) characteristic of ALD-oxides are shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†). The defect peak of the ALD-ZnO layer was not found in the nano-stratified layer. This means that the nano-stratified layer is denser than other single layers which results in a low WVTR, as shown in Fig. S2b and Table S1 (ESI†).
For these reasons, the nano-stratified layer is suitable as the unit structure of an encapsulation barrier in ambient atmosphere. Unfortunately, there are quite a few negative studies on the stability of ALD-Al2O3 in aqueous environments.47,53,54 Since the wearable devices must be durable in aqueous environments, such as rainy days and washing, the degradation behavior of ALD-Al2O3 should be investigated and prevented.
To analyze the degradation behavior of ALD-Al2O3 in an aqueous environment, a nano-stratified layer was fabricated on a wafer substrate and stored in ambient atmosphere, and deionized (DI) water, for a week, respectively. Then, the thickness and optical constants of the fabricated samples were measured by the ellipsometric system. As shown in Fig. 1b, the samples stored in ambient atmosphere retained their thickness and optical constants while the samples stored in DI water showed considerable change. The detailed measurement results are reported in Table 1; the thickness was increased by about 16% and refractive index was decreased by about 16% for the samples stored in DI water. It was considered that these changes originated from chemical reactions rather than physical reactions, such as dissolution, because the thickness of the samples increased.

Based on this consideration, Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy (FT-IR) was conducted to analyze the changes in chemical structure. There was only a single absorbance peak near 900 cm−1 for the as-deposited sample, which is a typical frequency band for ALD-oxides, as indicated in Fig. 1c.55 On the other hand, for samples stored in the aqueous environment there was a new FT-IR signal that appeared at around 3300 cm−1 which represents the stretching of Al–OH bonding.56 Based on previous studies and FT-IR measurement results, the aqueous stored sample was judged to have undergone a phase transition to boehmite because of its –OH group.57
The chemical reaction mechanism explained in Fig. 1d illustrates the detailed process of the phase transition. First, the electron lone pair in Al2O3 attacks H2O resulting in a Lewis acid–base reaction. The intermediate product, pseudo boehmite, is formed after a nucleophilic attack on H2O that also occurs in the side part of Al2O3. The phase transition to boehmite eventually happens with the reaction between pseudo-boehmite, since the pseudo-boehmite has a positive charge on O while it has a negative charge on Al.
Although the ALD-Al2O3 is amorphous, crystallization occurs during the phase transition to boehmite. During the phase transition, the molar volume of Al expands due to the crystallization, thereby resulting in an increase in the total thickness of the structure. In addition, since grain boundaries contained in the crystalline structure act as penetration pathways for moisture and oxygen, the WVTR will be greatly increased. This means that the phase transition of Al2O3 inside the nano-stratified layer must be suppressed to achieve a washable encapsulation barrier.
Functional encapsulation barrier with SiO2–polymer composite
Although there have not been many studies on preventing the phase transition of Al2O3 from the viewpoint of the encapsulation barrier, a few studies have been reported to prevent the deterioration of Al2O3 thin film by adopting vacuum deposited oxide capping layers.46,58 Since the previously used vacuum deposited oxide capping layer is fragile and difficult to apply to textile-based wearable devices, we suggested new polymeric capping layers with various SiO2 content which provide excellent mechanical properties. We experimentally verified that the SiO2 contained in the polymer can effectively suppress the phase transition of ALD-Al2O3.
To estimate the ability of SiO2 to prevent the phase transition, three different polymer materials with different SiO2 contents (Pno,SiO2: polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), Plow,SiO2: cyclo-aliphatic epoxy oligosiloxane resin, and Phigh,SiO2: SiO2–polymer composite) were carefully selected and used as the capping layer. The chemical structure of the selected polymeric materials is described in Fig. S3 (ESI†). For quantitative comparison of the SiO2 content in each of the polymers, FT-IR measurement was conducted. It confirmed that Phigh,SiO2 had the highest Si–O bond quantity among the three candidate polymers, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†).
A unit dyad of functional encapsulation barrier, made up of a nano-stratified layer (5 pairs of ALD-Al2O3 and ALD-ZnO) and a polymer capping layer, is illustrated in Fig. 2a. To compare barrier properties depending on the polymer capping layer, a unit dyad of nano-stratified layers with the selected polymers was fabricated and stored in an aqueous environment for a week. After storing, the barrier containing PVA showed a considerable decrease in thickness due to its water-soluble property. On the other hand, there was little thickness change in Plow,SiO2 and Phigh,SiO2 which means that these polymers can act as a physical capping layer as shown in Fig. 2b and Table 2.

For application as a washable encapsulation barrier, the encapsulation barrier should not only avoid being dissolved by water, but also should suppress the phase transition of Al2O3 as noted above. Since crystallization during the phase transition increases the molar volume of Al, the surface also becomes rougher, as shown in Fig. 2c.59 Since the PVA was entirely dissolved by water, the surface roughness of the unit encapsulation barrier was measured for the case of Plow,SiO2 and Phigh,SiO2. As shown in Fig. 2d and e and Table 2, there are quite different results for Plow,SiO2 and Phigh,SiO2. In both cases, the increase in surface roughness was lower than the case without a capping layer, however, it was still rough in the case of Plow,SiO2.
The peak-to-valley roughness, which is an important factor because the encapsulation barrier acts as a superstrate on the textile substrate, was also superior in Phigh,SiO2 compared to Plow,SiO2 as shown in Table S2 (ESI†). It is also clear, from Fig. S5 (ESI†), that the change in the optical constant of the barriers with Plow,SiO2 and Phigh,SiO2 showed the same tendency as their change in thickness. On the basis of these measurements, as theoretically expected, it was determined that the higher the SiO2 content in the polymer was, the more the phase transition was effectively prevented.

Fig. 3a shows the theoretical mechanism explaining how SiO2 contained in the polymer as a capping layer inhibits the phase transition.53 As the dyad of the encapsulation barrier was submerged in DI water, adsorption of water occurs on the ALD-Al2O3 surface and SiO2 surface. The surface of the ALD-Al2O3 becomes hydroxylated because it possesses strong basic hydroxyl groups, formed during ALD deposition. Consequently, the hydroxylated ALD-Al2O3 surface is positively charged by protons (H+) from the dissociation of water. In summary, two electrons from the oxygen atom bond to H+, yielding a protonated Al intermediate as described by reaction (2), where the asterisk represents a surface Al atom. Al*–OH + H2O → Al*–OH2+ + OH−(2)
 Fig. 3  (a) Protonation–deprotonation mechanism between SiO2 polymer capping and ALD deposited Al2O3; electrical calcium test result: (b) normalized conductance vs. time graph for various dyads of functional encapsulation barrier, and (c) change in WVTR with various dipping times. 
With the basicity of the formed hydroxide (OH−), the dissolution of silicon oxides and the deprotonation process, and the formation of dihydrogen silicate, occur as in reaction (3). However, immediately, another protonation process (reaction (4)) readily proceeds on the surface of the ALD-Al2O3 because the silicic acid is slightly acidic while the surface is basic. SiO2 + 2OH− → SiO2(OH)22−(3) SiO2(OH)22− + H2O → SiO(OH)3− + OH−(4)
As the reactions are assumed to occur under water, it is clear that all the products easily diffuse into the surrounding area. Due to the diffusion of the products, the hydroxylated ALD-Al2O3 surface can undergo more than one silicification reaction, and reaction (5) is one of the basic processes. With this silicification process which contains the strong intermolecular condensation of Si–O–Si, an inert passivation silicon oxide (SiOX) capping layer is formed on the surface of ALD-Al2O3 as shown in reaction (6). SiO(OH)3− + Al–OH2+ → Al–O–Si(OH)3 + H2O↑(5) Al–O–Si(OH)3 + 3(HO)Si–O–Al → Al–O–Si(OH)3–O–2(HO)Si–O–Al + H2O↑(6)
Although the formed SiOX capping layer is re-dissolved depending on hydrothermal conditions, another capping layer, which also prevents the phase transition by protecting the Al–O–Al bond, will be formed, since the dissolving product must be another kind of silicic acid. From this chemical mechanism, it can be understood why the high SiO2 content polymer shows the best performance as a capping layer and suppresses the phase transition, since it involves both physical and chemical effects.
On the other hand, it is generally known that the encapsulation barrier should have at least 10−5 g m−2 day−1 level of WVTR for organic-based electronics. Unfortunately, the WVTR of a unit dyad of the proposed encapsulation barrier was estimated to be 1.47 × 10−4 g m−2 day−1, which is not enough for devices. Table 3 represents the calculated WVTR based on Fig. 3b, which indicates the change in normalized conductance over time: 1.47 × 10−4 g m−2 day−1, 6.87 × 10−5 g m−2 day−1, and 1.18 × 10−5 g m−2 day−1 for the increment of a dyad.

In conclusion, 3 dyads of nano-stratified layer and SiO2 polymer were adopted as the final structure of the encapsulation barrier. In summary, the role of each material in the encapsulation barrier is as follows: the nano-stratified layer is the main gas barrier, with high flexibility provided by a reaction between ALD-Al2O3 and ALD-ZnO as described in reaction (7).32 The SiO2 polymer makes the barrier a washable one by preventing its phase transition. ZnOH* + Al(CH3)3 → Al(OH)(CH3)* + Zn(CH3)2(7)
To examine the capping effect in a multi-dyad encapsulation barrier, the WVTR was measured over time for various kinds of encapsulation barrier, after immersion in detergent water. The same PVA, Plow,SiO2, and Phigh,SiO2 were used as a polymer layer for an encapsulation barrier for comparison, respectively. The results are reported in Fig. 3c and Table 4, and show the same tendency as in the previous results. In the case of PVA, the encapsulation barrier suffered critical damage from detergent water, causing it to lose its WVTR in just a day.

On the other hand, when Plow,SiO2 was used, it exhibited slight moisture permeability even after a certain time, due to the physical capping effect, which did not dissolve in water. Since the Plow,SiO2 has no chemical capping effect to prevent the phase transition, the WVTR sharply increased with time, and it became impossible to estimate after 7 days.
Nevertheless, for the encapsulation barrier of Phigh,SiO2, SiO2 polymer, it was found that the change in WVTR was not significant even after 7 days. Practically, in a real washing process and daily routine, the devices would not be dipped continuously in detergent over 7 days. As a result, it is expected that the proposed encapsulation barrier will play an important role in wearable devices.
Textile-based washable PSCs with a functional encapsulation barrier
A wearable PSC was fabricated with this proposed functional encapsulation barrier on a real textile substrate made of polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) fibers. There are two kinds of method for applying an encapsulation barrier; direct encapsulation and attachable encapsulation. Direct encapsulation forms an encapsulation barrier directly on the fabricated device, while the procedure of attachable encapsulation attaches the transparent and flexible superstrate which contains the encapsulation barrier, to the fabricated device.
Since the direct encapsulation is fabricated straight onto devices, it prevents the penetration of moisture and oxygen very efficiently, but the devices are exposed to thermal and ultraviolet (UV) damage during encapsulation. As the low bandgap polymer in this experiment is very vulnerable to thermal damage, the direct encapsulation method is not suitable. Recently, high-efficiency PSC devices using non-fullerene acceptors with narrow bandgap have been announced. Some of the devices with non-fullerene acceptors exhibit better thermal stability than conventional devices with the PC71BM fullerene acceptor, but it was reported that the PCE of these devices dropped drastically when exposed to sustained heat.60 Also, other devices with non-fullerene acceptors have shown high sensitivity to annealing temperatures.61 Therefore, even if a high-efficiency device is used, the device efficiency can be adversely affected by continuous exposure to the heat generated during the direct encapsulation process.
On the other hand, the infiltration of moisture and oxygen through the adhesive side is considered a disadvantage of attachable encapsulation. However, this issue is being solved by the development of new adhesive materials. In addition, the device is not only protected from heat and UV, but the entire process time is shortened because the deposition can be conducted on the substrate and superstrate simultaneously, and in parallel. This shorter process time can contribute to a reduction in manufacturing cost because it can be simultaneously applied to the R2R process, and replace the existing slow ALD process.50 Also, the attachable encapsulation technology suggested in this study does not require a special curing process to attach the encapsulation film to the wearable devices. This can minimize air exposure of the fabricated devices during the large area (>100 cm2) encapsulation process by using the R2R method. This is possible because the encapsulation process can be completed immediately when attaching the pre-fabricated encapsulant film to the device using the R2R process, without any special curing process. This advantage enables potential application of the proposed attachable encapsulation technology to encapsulate large area flexible modules. Fig. 4a shows the fabrication process for the textile-based wearable PSC device and Fig. 4b and Table 5 show the difference between the direct and attachable encapsulation methods.

The washing test was conducted several times to determine whether the textile-based PSC could operate stably without degradation. During the washing test, the devices were totally submerged in a solution of 2 vol% neutral detergent dissolved in DI water at 200 rpm for 10 minutes duration. The schematic diagram of the washing stage can be seen in Fig. S6 (ESI†).
Because the surface roughness of the encapsulation barrier is less than 0.5 nm even after dipping, the device could be fabricated well on a textile substrate. Fig. 4c shows the change in the electrical characteristics of the textile-based wearable PSC with the number of washing cycles. For the device with the functional encapsulation barrier, the performance was maintained without deteriorating efficiency even after a total of 20 times washing.
In order to clearly confirm the performance of the PSCs following washing, Fig. 4d indicates the change in the performance factors of the PSCs depending on the number of washings. From Fig. 4d and Table 6, it can be seen that the PSC with the functional encapsulation barrier retained more than 98% of its initial efficiency after the washing test. The other test factors also verified that the device could operate stably after washing. These results prove that the functional encapsulation barrier protected the moisture-sensitive wearable PSCs effectively during the washing process and also had no adverse effect on water penetration through the flank of the device.

Prototype of a textile-based washable optoelectronic module
Among the various electronic applications that can be driven with milliwatts, OLEDs are a light source that can be used to display information. The optoelectronic module which enables textile-based OLEDs to act as a display with the energy generated from the textile-based PSC can be a core technology in wearable devices. For this reason, the PSCs and OLEDs were fabricated on a textile substrate together. No physical damage, such as exfoliation of the superstrate, was found when tensile stress was applied to the device, as shown in Fig. S7a (ESI†). In order to confirm the change in electrical characteristics due to bending, the bending test was repeated 1000 times at a bending radius of 3 mm.
The electrical characteristics of each device after the bending test are reported in Fig. S7b–d and Table S3 (ESI†). It can be seen that the electrical characteristics were maintained, even after bending 1000 times. As described above, since the device uses the textile itself as a substrate, it has the advantage of being very flexible due to excellent mechanical properties of the textile. Therefore, it was confirmed that the textile-based device has enough flexibility to be used as a wearable device, even when it contains a superstrate with an encapsulation barrier.
The prototype of an optoelectronic module that contains both OLEDs and PSCs on a textile substrate was fabricated, and washing and bending tests were performed together to check the stability. The schematic and washing process of the fabricated prototype is shown in Fig. 5a and Video S1 (ESI†). Despite the application of washing and bending, there was no change in the electrical characteristics of the device with the encapsulation barrier, as shown in Fig. 5b. If cracks are generated by tensile stress during bending, moisture penetrates rapidly during the washing process with significant deterioration, but no degradation was observed, as indicated in Table 7.

Finally, the properties of the prototype modules (NPSC = 8, NOLED = 5) were measured every 7 days after 1000 iterations of bending and 10 minutes of washing. Table 8 shows the characteristics of each device, while Fig. 5c indicates the rate of change over time. As a result, the prototype of the optoelectronic module showed high reliability, maintaining 98.3% of the initial PCE for the PSC, and 94.2% of the initial intensity for the OLED after 30 days. In summary, a washable textile-based optoelectronic module was realized in this paper using a functional encapsulation barrier, which maintained low WVTR after washing.

To realize a wearable self-powered system, wearable secondary batteries that can store electrical energy are an essential element. Several studies of wearable batteries have been conducted.62 In order to charge the secondary battery effectively, the PSC module should generate the proper voltage and current. The proper voltage required for battery charging can be adjusted by making a series connection of the unit PSC devices, and the proper current required for battery charging can be adjusted by controlling the illuminated area of the unit PSC device, or by parallel connection of the unit PSC devices.63
The charging time of the battery depends on the capacity of the battery and the voltage/current amount generated by the PSC module. The discharging time depends on the capacity of the battery and the power consumed by the connected wearable devices. Therefore, the charging/discharging time of the battery of the self-powered system can be designed according to a specific use and environment. To implement an efficient self-powered system that consists of the PSC module and battery, the PSC module generates electric power for battery charging, and for devices operating during daytime when sunlight is available. After sunset, the battery should supply electric power to operate the other devices. For this reason, it can be extrapolated that the optimal charging time of the battery of the wearable self-powered system is 4–6 hours during the day time and the optimal discharging time is 3–5 hours at night.
Conclusions
In this paper, we fabricated highly reliable textile-based wearable PSCs including functional washable thin film encapsulation, and demonstrated their characteristics. The introduced functionalized SiO2–polymer composite capping layer imparts stability, which prevents damage to the porous membrane during the washing process, through a chemical reaction with the internal Al2O3 layer. Since the chemical reaction prevents the phase transition of Al2O3, the encapsulation barrier can endure detergent water. The PSCs fabricated on a substrate of real textile showed excellent stability even after undergoing a washing process, without losing the mechanical flexibility of the textile. Even in the optoelectronic module, which was fabricated together with OLEDs, it showed high reliability with no deterioration in properties after 30 days under both bending stress and washing. The textile-based washable PSCs are expected to perform an important role in the next generation power sources of wearable E-textiles, and various optoelectronic applications, in the fourth industrial revolution.

Broader context
The realization of a washable textile power source is one of great interest in the wearable device industry. To realize the full potential of textile power sources, not only is a high barrier thin-film encapsulation required, but enhanced aqueous stability, to withstand washing, is also essential. Despite this, most studies have focused on the barrier property in general atmospheric environments. Even when the washability of the barriers has been considered, few works have demonstrated wearable devices with effective operating lifetimes under aqueous environments. In this paper, we report real textile-based washable polymer solar cells for optoelectronic modules, by adopting a new polymeric buffer layer for encapsulation. To avoid the deterioration of polymer solar cells during washing, a SiO2–polymer composite was deliberately inserted in the encapsulation barrier. It is confirmed that the degradation was prevented by the protonation–deprotonation reaction between the SiO2 contained in the SiO2–polymer composite and the ALD deposited Al2O3. The effect of this reaction, which has been theoretically proven, was also experimentally demonstrated in this study. When integrated with polymer solar cells, organic light emitting diodes, and encapsulation barriers on textiles, the washable optoelectronic modules demonstrated a lifetime of over 30 days with periodic washing.
