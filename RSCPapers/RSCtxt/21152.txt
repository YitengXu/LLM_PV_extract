    , Accepted 13th May 2015First published on 14th May 2015AbstractA photoconductive device of phosphotungstic acid (denoted as PW12) and TiO2 composite was fabricated. Compared to pristine TiO2, the composite materials of PW12–TiO2 displayed a remarkable enhancement (ca. 2000-fold) in their photocurrent values. Furthermore, the composite materials also exhibited good gas sensing performance for acetone.
Nanostructured photoconductive materials have drawn considerable attention due to their unique photoelectric properties and potential applications in a variety of devices such as photodetectors, optical switching devices and gas sensors.1–5 Metal–oxide semiconductors, such as TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, WO3 and Cu2O, are currently considered as one of the most promising photoconductive materials.6–9 In particular, titania (TiO2) has received a lot of attention due to its chemical inertness, photostability, nontoxicity, and low cost.10 However, the photoconductivity of pristine TiO2 is unsatisfactory in practical applications because its high interfacial electron–hole recombination causes low carrier mobility. To solve these problems, various strategies have been adopted, including controlling the morphology (e.g., nanorods or nanotubes), doping, and combination with other materials.11–14 At present, it still remains a great challenge to develop TiO2-based composite materials to synergistically improve the photoconductive performance of TiO2.
Polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of molecular metal-oxo cluster compounds based mainly on Mo, W, and V, have shown superior physicochemical properties and various applications in catalysis, materials science and medicine.15–17 In particular, POMs have an intrinsic characteristic to be an efficient electron acceptor,18–20 which could capture the photogenerated electrons from semiconductors and then transport the electrons to the neighboring domain. Ozer and Ferry investigated the use of POMs in TiO2 suspensions to increase the photocatalytic efficiency of 1,2-dichlorobenzene.21 Yoon et al. reported that phosphotungstic acid played a vital role to improve the energy conversion efficiency of the TiO2 anode in a dye-sensitized solar cell.22 Recently, we reported the preparation and characterization of several POMs–TiO2 composite photoanodes, which exhibited a remarkable improvement in photoelectrochemical performance in comparison with pristine TiO2.23–25 The abovementioned results motivated us to explore a new avenue of improving the photoconductivity of TiO2 by virtue of a synergistic effect with the POMs. To the best of our knowledge, the photoconductivity of the POMs–TiO2 composite materials has been virtually unexplored so far.
Furthermore, gas sensors relying on the photoconductive changes have been attracting interest due to their advantages such as low power consumption and fast response to the surrounding environment. The detection of acetone gas is of practical significance because acetone is a index for some diseases in exhaled human breath, as well as a volatile and hazardous chemical solvent used in industry or the laboratory.26,27 Thus, we have also attempted to carry out a pilot investigation on sensing acetone gas using the photoconductivity of the POMs–TiO2 composite materials, which is certainly beneficial to the development of acetone gas sensors.
Herein, we report the fabrication and performance of the photoconductive device made up of the POMs–TiO2 composite materials, where one of the POMs is phosphotungstic acid (H3PW12O40, denoted as PW12). The dependence of the photoconductive performance on the amount of POMs used was also investigated. Compared to the pristine TiO2 device, the POMs–TiO2 device showed a remarkable enhancement (ca. 2000-fold) in its photocurrent response. Moreover, the sensing performance of the POMs–TiO2 device for acetone gas exhibits an obvious improvement. These results provide valuable information for developing POMs-based semiconductor composite materials for potential applications in gas sensors, optoelectronics and photovoltaic devices.
The preparation of the PW12–TiO2 composite in this work was similar to the reported procedure.28 The samples prepared have different molar ratios of PW12 and TiO2, which include 0.0015:1, 0.01:1, 0.015:1, 0.02:1, and 0.15:1. They are denoted as PT-1, PT-2, PT-3, PT-4 and PT-5, respectively. The detailed experimental procedure and fabrication of the photoconductive device used in this work can be found in the ESI.† IR spectra have been carried out to examine the structural stability of the POMs in the composite. Fig. 1A portrays the IR spectra of pure TiO2 (a) and the PW12–TiO2 composite (b). In comparison with curve a, curve b exhibits characteristic bands for the POMs at 700–1100 cm−1. The characteristic peaks observed at 1080, 983, 890, and 798 cm−1 are assigned to υas(P–O), υas(WO) and υas(W–O–W), respectively, suggesting that the Keggin structure of the PW12 is retained in the composite. Fig. 1B shows the XRD patterns of pure TiO2 (a) and the PW12–TiO2 composite (b) for determining the crystal phase of TiO2. Both the samples exhibit diffraction peaks of usual anatase and rutile phases, just like pure P25, indicating that the nanocrystalline structure remains in the composite. No diffraction peaks for the POMs are observed in the composite, which may be due to the amorphous state of the POMs.29

UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is an important analytical tool for characterizing the optical properties of TiO2. Fig. 1C shows a comparison of the UV-vis spectra for pure TiO2 (a) and the PW12–TiO2 composite (b). Both the samples possess broad absorption bands in the UV region. The absorption spectrum of the composite shows a little absorption in the visible region as compared with that of pure TiO2. This may be ascribed to the promotion of electrons from the TiO2 valence band to isolated LUMO of the POMs.28 In addition, the band gap energy obtained from the inset of Fig. 1C for TiO2 and the composite are ca. 3.22 eV and 3.18 eV, respectively. These results suggest that the presence of the PW12 anion has an influence on the electronic properties of TiO2 in the as-prepared composites.
SEM can provide detailed information on the surface morphology and the homogeneity of films. Fig. 2A and B show SEM images of the pure TiO2 film and the PW12–TiO2 composite film. The film surface of both samples is rough and consists of typical spherical or granular patterns. The mean diameter of the granules is ca. 30 nm and 34 nm, respectively. Fig. 2C shows the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis results for the PW12–TiO2 composite film surface, which demonstrates the existence of Ti, P W, and O. From the observation of the three element mappings of Ti, P and W (Fig. 2D–F), PW12 is uniformly distributed throughout the TiO2 film.

To investigate the photoconductive performance of the samples, we monitored the photocurrent response of these photoconductive devices under Xe lamp irradiation. The device structure is illustrated in Fig. 3A. Fig. 3B displays the photocurrent responses obtained for the TiO2 device and the PW12–TiO2 devices with different contents of POMs (PT-1, PT-2, PT-3, PT-4 and PT-5). All the samples show steady and reproducible photocurrent responses during several on/off cycles of the Xe lamp irradiation. The photocurrent response intensity increases in the order of PT-1 < PT-2 < PT-3 < PT-4. This indicates that the photocurrent of the PW12–TiO2 composite increases gradually as the content of POMs increases. However, the photocurrent of PT-5 decreases compared to that of PT-4, i.e., the excessive content of POMs could cause a negative effect. This is attributed to the inner-filter effect of the POMs, by which more POMs could absorb a significant fraction of the incident UV, so that the light-harvesting of the TiO2 particles was reduced practically.30 Also, the excessive content of POMs may behave as a deep electron trap,25 and thus the photocurrent was reduced somewhat. The above results indicate that the photocurrent responses of the PW12–TiO2 composite are clearly dependent on the content of the POMs.

Furthermore, we compared the photoconductive performance of the pure TiO2 device and the PW12–TiO2 device at a constant bias of 1 V. Taking PT-4 as representative, the photocurrent response of PT-4 is much higher than that of the TiO2 (Fig. 3B). The value of the photogenerated current for PT-4 is ca. 0.56 μA, while for TiO2 it is only 0.28 nA. This indicates a large change in the photocurrent generation, which is about 2000 times more in PT-4 compared to pure TiO2. The ultrahigh photoresponse suggests that a synergic effect occurs between TiO2 and PW12.
To further explore the photoconductive performance of the PW12–TiO2 composite, the current–voltage (I–V) curves (Fig. 3C) for pure TiO2 device and the PT-4 device have been measured. The I–V curves are nearly linear, which indicates an ohmic contact under illumination.31 The PT-4 device shows higher photocurrent responses than the pure TiO2 device at each voltage. The above results indicate that incorporating POMs into TiO2 is an effective approach for enhancing the photoconductive response of TiO2.
The surface photocurrent technique can provide information about the change of the conductance of the semiconductor under the illumination of light.32Fig. 3D portrays the surface photocurrent spectra of pure TiO2 and PT-4. It can be seen that PT-4 shows a much higher surface photocurrent response than TiO2 in the UV region. No surface photocurrent response is observed for pure TiO2 in the visible region (λ ≥ 400 nm), while a weak surface photocurrent response was observed for PT-4. These further demonstrate that the incorporation of PW12 into TiO2 film could effectively enhance the photoconductive performance of TiO2.
The photoconductivity can reflect the free carrier density and is straightforward to interpret the competition between photogeneration, recombination and trapping.33 In this work, the main mechanism for the photoconductivity generation is proposed as follows: when pure TiO2 (a typical n-type semiconductor) is exposed to air, some oxygen molecules will be adsorbed onto the TiO2 surfaces and capture free electrons from the semiconductor to form negatively charge species (e.g., O2−, O− and O2−), which creates a low-conductivity depletion layer near its surface.34 Under light irradiation, electron–hole pairs are generated. Then the photogenerated holes migrate to the surface and are neutralized by the oxygen ions. This leads to leaving some unpaired electrons to produce a persistent photocurrent because of an enhancement of carrier density. However, there are fewer unpaired electrons in the pure TiO2 due to fast electron–hole recombination. The higher photocurrent response in the PW12–TiO2 composite can be explained with the help of the band diagram (Fig. 3E). The LUMO level of PW12 and the CB level of TiO2 are +0.22 and −0.5 V versus NHE, respectively, thus suggesting that electron transfer from the TiO2, CB to PW12 is a favorable exothermic process. Previous researchers have already proved the electron transfer from TiO2 to PW12 by transient absorption spectra;35i.e., TiO2 photoelectrons in the excited state can be transferred to PW12. The electron transfer process not only separates the photogenerated electrons and holes quickly but also reduces the electron–hole recombination rates, leading to an increase of free carrier density. Therefore, the PW12–TiO2 composite shows superior photoconductive performance than pure TiO2.
To probe the gas sensing performance of these devices, their responsive behavior for acetone was investigated under Xe lamp irradiation. Fig. 4A presents the photocurrent responses of the pure TiO2 device and PT-4 device in different concentrations of acetone. The photocurrent responses gradually decrease with a sequential increase in acetone concentration. When acetone is injected, gas–solid photocatalytic oxidation–reduction reactions can occur on the surface of TiO2 under light irradiation. The photocatalytic reactions consume both holes and excited electrons, resulting in a reduction of the carrier density and thus decrease the photocurrent responses of the devices.36,37 Compared to the pure TiO2 device, the PT-4 device shows a much more obvious photocurrent response at each concentration of acetone. PW12 can promote the charge separation and reduce the electron–hole recombination, thus there are more electrons. The sensitivity (S) of the device is defined as S = (IM − IS)/IM, where IM is the maximum photocurrent before acetone gas injection and IS is the smallest photocurrent after addition of acetone gas. As shown in Fig. 4B, the PT-4 device exhibits a higher sensitivity than the TiO2 device, which indicates that PT-4 possesses a more significant gas sensing activity for acetone. In addition, Fig. S1 (see ESI†) shows the photocurrent response of the PT-4 device at 300 ppm acetone gas for 4 cycles, suggesting that the device has good reproducibility. These results demonstrate that the PW12–TiO2 composite possesses good gas sensing performance for acetone.

Conclusions
The photoconductive performance of PW12–TiO2 composite materials has been explored by photocurrent response measurements. The photocurrent of the PW12–TiO2 composite was strongly dependent on the amount of POMs. Compared to pristine TiO2, PT-4 displayed a much higher photocurrent response; this is mainly attributed to the reduced electron–hole recombination rate, which increases free carrier density. Moreover, the photoconductive device of PW12–TiO2 composite materials possess better gas sensing performance for acetone than TiO2. The results obtained from this study show that the rational combination of POMs with TiO2 could effectively improve the photoconductivity as well as the gas sensing performance, which provides new insight to develop advanced composite materials for practical applications in gas sensors and optoelectronic devices.
