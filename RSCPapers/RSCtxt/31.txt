However, CsPbI2Br PSCs are still facing a challenge due to their relatively low power conversion efficiency (PCE) and moisture sensitivity. Herein, a simple and effective in situ growth method was adopted to construct a two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D/3D) heterostructure by spinning n-butylammonium bromide (BABr) on the top of a 3D CsPbI2Br perovskite film. The such fabricated high-quality 2D/3D CsPbI2Br film exhibits excellent hydrophobicity against moisture invasion, and a well-matched energy level with the hole transport layer (HTL) facilitating hole extraction at the perovskite/HTL interface. As a result, the optimized 2D/3D CsPbI2Br solar cell achieves an excellent PCE of 16.57% with improved stability. Based on this, we developed an all-PTSC having 2D/3D CsPbI2Br and MAPbI3 as the optical absorption layer of top and bottom cells, respectively, along with a solution-processed PEDOT:PSS film with high conductivity and high transmittance as the recombination layer. The fabricated all-PTSC exhibits a PCE of 10.22% and an ultrahigh open-circuit voltage of 2.33 V, approaching the sum of the light voltages of the two sub-cells. Benefiting from the outstanding thermal stability and hydrophobicity of 2D/3D CsPbI2Br, the all-PTSC showed superior stability under heat and air. This work demonstrates that all-inorganic perovskites as the photo-response cores of top cells are appropriate candidates for the fabrication of efficient and stable monolithic all-PTSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) solar cells have developed rapidly in just a few years, and their PCE has climbed up to 25.7% from the initial 3.8%.1–5 However, due to the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) limit, the theoretical maximum PCE of single-junction PSCs can only reach ∼33%.6 To break through the S–Q limit of single-junction cells, tandem solar cells (TSCs) capable of broadening the solar spectrum utilization and thus realizing a theoretical efficiency of >45% have been exploited.7,8 Among them, monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells (all-PTSCs) have gained more attention due to their low-cost and facile solution fabrication.9,10 The traditional strategy for all-PTSC fabrication is to utilize a wide-bandgap OIHP and narrow-bandgap photoactive material to separately absorb high and low energy photons, combined with a solution-processed recombination layer. Several typical examples such as FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(Br0.7I0.3)3/MAPbI3 and Cs0.15FA0.85Pb(I0.3Br0.7)3/MAPbI3 based all-PTSCs have been reported, in which wide-bandgap OIHP based solar cells often serve as the top cells.11,12 Owing to the facile oxidation and decomposition of volatile organic cations such as FA+ in OIHPs, wide-bandgap OIHP based top cells will inevitably suffer from poor thermal and long-term stability, resulting in stability decrease of all-PTSCs.13–18 It has been demonstrated that all-inorganic Cs-based (CsPbX3, X = I, Br or mixed halogen) perovskites are more stable and possess wider bandgap characteristics than OIHPs, and thus can be considered as the ideal photo-responsive cores of top cells in all-PTSCs, which has yet to be reported so far.
Among all-inorganic Cs-based perovskite materials, CsPbI2Br, with a suitable band gap (1.82–1.92 eV) and excellent thermal stability, is considered one of the most promising material candidates for the photo-responsive core in the top cells of all-PTSCs.19–25 As for CsPbI2Br-based PSCs, the inferior CsPbI2Br film quality and poor interface contact at the perovskite/HTL still are big challenges for cell performance improvement.26In situ growth of quasi-2D perovskites to form 2D/3D heterostructured PSCs has been proven to be effective in addressing these issues because quasi-2D perovskites provide a defect-free interface and modified energy band which allow minimizing charge recombination at the interface and act as a protective layer for 3D perovskites.27–37 For example, Tai et al. spin-coated BAI on top of a CsPbI2Br perovskite layer to form a 2D/3D heterostructure through the cation exchange reaction between BA+ and Cs+, yielding a PCE of 14.5% and enhanced humidity stability.38 Li et al. used benzimidazolium iodide to post-treat a 3D CsPbI2Br film, which resulted in an inverted 2D/3D PSC with a PCE of 14.32% as well as excellent environmental stability.39 Apart from this, considering that the introduction of excessive Br− may provide more halogen ions to fill the I vacancies in the perovskite matrix on account of the electronegativity of Br and the bond energy of Pb–Br being stronger than that of I and Pb–I, respectively,40,41 the 2D/3D heterostructure formed by the reaction of the organic matter formed by the long chain alkyl cation binding with the anion Br− and 3D perovskite here is anticipated to improve the CsPbI2Br-based film quality and corresponding device performance.42
In this context, we herein spin-coat BABr on the top of a CsPbI2Br film via an in situ growth strategy. Under the action of a simple cation exchange reaction, the top of the 3D perovskite film transforms into a thin layer of quasi-2D perovskite, thus forming a CsPbI2Br film with a 2D/3D heterostructure. A series of characterization studies show that the 2D/3D heterostructure can not only passivate the defects of the film and thus lead to low trap density, but also make the perovskite film more compatible with the energy level of the HTL, which is beneficial to the extraction rate of holes. Afterwards, 2D/3D CsPbI2Br solar cells with the ITO/SnO2/2D/3D CsPbI2Br/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag structure were integrated, and the optimal efficiency enhanced from the initial 14.78% to 16.57%. Also, the 2D/3D CsPbI2Br solar cell shows remarkable thermal and humidity stability. Based on the high-efficiency and high-stability 2D/3D CsPbI2Br PSC, monolithic all-PTSCs with the device configuration of ITO/SnO2/2D/3D CsPbI2Br/spiro-OMeTAD/PEDOT:PSS/C60/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag were fabricated, where PEDOT:PSS prepared using facile solution processing served as a recombination layer. The fabricated monolithic all-PTSC showed a PCE of 10.22%, with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 2.33 V, approaching the total optical voltage of the two sub-cells. Moreover, the fabricated tandem device demonstrates excellent thermal and air stability, retaining 84% of the initial efficiency after 300 h in nitrogen at 85 °C, and 96% after 350 h in air at 15% relative humidity (RH), respectively. This work provides practical exploration of the application of CsPbI2Br to all-PTSCs.
Results and discussion
The preparation process of CsPbI2Br solar cells with 2D/3D heterostructures and the related experimental details are illustrated in Fig. 1a. A 2D/3D heterostructure obtained by the in situ formation method is schematically shown in Fig. 1b. To investigate the crystal quality of the perovskite films and confirm the existence of the quasi-2D layer, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were implemented (Fig. 2a). Both 3D CsPbI2Br film and films treated with BABr solution show similar diffraction peaks at around 14.7°, 21.0°, and 29.6°, corresponding to the typical crystal planes of the CsPbI2Br lattice, i.e. (100), (110) and (200) crystal planes.40 Moreover, the diffraction peaks of the BABr-treated perovskite films showed stronger intensity, indicating higher crystallinity. More importantly, the (100) and (200) XRD characteristic peaks shifted to lower 2θ positions for the perovskite films treated with BABr (0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg mL−1 BABr) and then to higher 2θ positions for the optimized perovskite films (3 and 5 mg mL−1 BABr), and these results correspond to the lattice expansion and lattice contraction, respectively (Fig. S1a†). The unique phenomenon is the result of the interaction of BA+ or Br− with CsPbI2Br, which is consistent with literature reports.41,43 It should be noted that some new diffraction peaks located at 2θ ≈ 8.86°, 13.26°, 17.64°, 26.62°, and 31.04° appeared as the concentration of BABr increased to 5 mg mL−1 (denoted with a rhombus in Fig. S1b†). Based on the new characteristic peaks and Bragg’s diffraction law, the unique superlattice spacing of the quasi-2D perovskite layer formed on top of the 3D CsPbI2Br layer is ∼2.0 nm (Fig. 2b), which is in line with the characteristics of quasi-2D perovskite materials (BA2Csn-1PbnI3n+1 with n = 2) reported in the literature (Fig. 2c).44,45 In addition, these new diffraction patterns correspond to the characteristic peaks of the quasi-2D perovskite in Fig. S1c,† indicating the structure of the quasi-2D BA2CsPb2I2Br5 perovskite in this work.

The morphologies of the pristine film and BABr-treated films were evaluated with top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. 3. It can be observed that the 3D CsPbI2Br film is uniform and highly crystalline with a similar compact texture (Fig. 3a), which is in good agreement with previous studies.39 With low-concentration BABr (0.1, 0.5, 1, and 3 mg mL−1) treatment, the optimized films become smoother and have lamellar crystals attached to them, which confirmed the existence of a quasi-2D perovskite layer after low-concentration BABr treatment.38 Therefore, we speculated that the 2D/3D heterostructure has already formed after low-concentration BABr treatment, although no obvious quasi-2D diffraction peaks were detected in the XRD pattern due to the relatively low concentration of BABr. Fig. 3f shows the cross-sectional images of the 3D perovskite layer of ∼350 nm thickness and the thin quasi-2D perovskite layer of ∼20 nm, where the thickness of the quasi-2D perovskite layer increases at the cost of reducing the thickness of CsPbI2Br during the in situ reaction (Fig. S2†). In addition, we performed energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping (Fig. S4†), which showed that the content of elements such as C, N, and Br in the film after the BABr treatment (0.5 mg mL−1) increased slightly (Fig. 4a), confirming the existence of BABr on the surface of the film. Also, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. S3†) demonstrate that the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the optimized film decreases from 29.8 nm to 17.8 nm, confirming the smoother morphology of the film after the BABr treatment (0.5 mg mL−1).

To deeply study the electronic interactions of the perovskite films, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed (Fig. 4b–d and S5†). One can see that the CsPbI2Br film with the 2D/3D heterostructure prepared using 0.5 mg mL−1 BABr has an increased strength of the C and Br signals (Fig. 4b and d) and a decreased strength of the Cs, Pb and I signals (Fig. S5†) compared to the 3D perovskite. More importantly, the peaks of Cs, Pb, I, and Br shift toward higher binding energies after BABr treatment, indicating that BA+ enters the CsPbI2Br lattice and changes the crystal structure. As such, the as-prepared 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure exhibits a change in the chemical environment where the elements such as Cs, Pb, I and Br present in the quasi-2D layer are located. Further, peaks moving towards higher binding energies also indicate that there exists a strong chemical bonding between Pb, Cs, and halide atoms which provides a basis for improving the stability of the films at the atomic level.38,46 A clear N 1s signal is obviously observed in the 2D/3D perovskite film yet not in the 3D CsPbI2Br film, verifying the existence of BA+ in the 2D/3D perovskite film (Fig. 4c).43
After proving the presence of the 2D/3D heterostructures and the influence of heterostructures on perovskite films, 2D/3D CsPbI2Br PSCs with the ITO/SnO2/2D/3D CsPbI2Br/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag structure were fabricated and are shown in Fig. 5a. Fig. 5b shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of pristine and optimized devices, and the specific performance parameters are listed in Table 1. We found that the pristine device generated a PCE of 14.78%, and the optimal device treated with 0.5 mg mL−1 BABr showed a significantly improved PCE of 16.57%, mainly attributed to the improved Jsc. With further increase in BABr concentration, the device efficiencies drop rapidly, possibly ascribed to the low conductivity and the thickness increase of the quasi-2D perovskite layers. Furthermore, the repeatable performance of the optimized devices is demonstrated by the device statistics in Fig. S8.†

To explore the root causes of device performance improvement, we performed steady-state photoluminescence (SSPL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements of the perovskite films deposited on ITO, as shown in Fig. 5c and d.43 It was found that the SSPL intensity of the 2D/3D perovskite film is better than that of the pristine film when the BABr concentration was 0.1 mg mL−1, and the intensity gradually decreased with the further increase of BABr concentration, which is in line with the variation trend of the TRPL decay lifetime. In addition, the blue-shift of the steady-state fluorescence spectrum peaks means suppressed non-radiative recombination of carriers and reduced defects in the perovskite films. More notably, as shown in the inset of Fig. 5c, the SSPL spectra of the optimized film have an isolated small peak at a wavelength of ∼530 nm belonging to the low-dimensional perovskite, indicating the existence of the quasi-2D perovskite layer.38,43 The results of TRPL reveal the decay lifetime of the pristine and 2D/3D perovskite films fitted with a bi-exponential decay function.47,48 The fitting parameters and calculated average decay lifetimes (τave) of the films are shown in Table S1.† It is found that the 3D CsPbI2Br film has a short τave (12.99 ns), whereas the 2D/3D perovskite film treated with 0.1 mg mL−1 BABr shows a longer lifetime (13.67 ns), implying that the 2D/3D heterostructure reduces defects and suppresses nonradiative recombination on the perovskite surface. However, the perovskite films with a 2D/3D heterostructure displayed shortened τave upon increasing BABr concentration from 0.1 to 3 mg mL−1, which may be related to the migration of photogenerated carriers.31,35
Then, we further investigated the electronic structures of the 3D CsPbI2Br film and the optimal 2D/3D perovskite film through ultraviolet photoelectron emission (UPS) measurements, as illustrated in Fig. 6. We know that the secondary electron cut-off (SECO) region in Fig. 6a can be used to determine the work function (WF) of the films using the general formula WF = hν − Ecutoff (hν value is 21.22 eV), and the valence band maximum onset energy (EVBM) is figured out through the general formula EVBM = hν − (Ecutoff − Eonset).49 The calculation results show that the WF value of the optimal 2D/3D perovskite film increases from 3.82 eV to 3.93 eV, while the EVBM decreased from 5.36 eV to 5.31 eV (Fig. 6b). These results mean that upward band bending occurs between the 2D/3D perovskite layer and the HTL, achieving better energy level arrangement and synergistically reducing electron accumulation at the interface. Therefore, the 2D/3D heterostructure can enhance the energy band of the light absorbing layer and the hole transport rate, thus achieving outstanding device performance.

As shown in Fig. 7a, the optimal 2D/3D CsPbI2Br PSC demonstrates an excellent PCE of 16.57% (Jsc = 15.92 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.28 V, and FF = 81.35%), which is significantly higher than that of the pristine device, whose PCE is 14.78% (Jsc = 15.61 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.25 V, and FF = 75.71%), and the increased FF and Voc are the main factors for PCE improvement. In addition, we tested the J−V curves of BABr and BAI-treated CsPbI2Br PSCs under the same experimental conditions and found that the BABr-modified device has higher efficiency and Voc, indicating that BABr has a better optimization effect than BAI (Fig. S6†).

(f) Mott–Schottky plots of pristine and optimal devices. 
In order to explore the accuracy of the above measurements and device reliability, steady-state power output curves at the maximum power spot of the control group and the optimized group were measured under continuous irradiation for 300 s, as illustrated in Fig. 7b. We found that the stable PCE of the device with the 2D/3D heterostructure is 16.47%, while that of the control one is 14.65%. Therefore, the steady-state power output results are consistent with the results of the J−V curves mentioned above, revealing the reliability of the J−V curves. We measured the incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices and found that all spectra exhibit similar onsets at ∼650 nm as shown in Fig. 7c,. Furthermore, the optimized device achieved an external quantum efficiency of >90% over a range of wavelengths (300 to 700 nm), and the current density agrees within error with the J−V measurements described above. Fig. 7d shows the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) of the electron-only devices with the structure ITO/SnO2/CsPbI2Br/PCBM/Ag, and the experiments were carried out under dark conditions. It is not difficult to see that there is a linear relationship between low bias voltage and current and a nonlinear relationship between high bias voltage and current, and the point at which the linear and nonlinear relationship shifts is the trap filling limit voltage (VTFL), which is positively correlated with the trap density (Nt).50,51 The VTFL value of the optimized device decreases from 0.51 to 0.18, and this quantitative trend provides solid evidence to prove the lower Nt and Vloss of the optimal device. Meanwhile, we also tested a hole-only device with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CsPbI2Br/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, and the decrease of VTFL also means the decrease of trap density of the optimized perovskite films (Fig. S7†). Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted under dark conditions (frequency range is 10 Hz–1 MHz, bias voltage is 0.8 V). The Nyquist plot is given in Fig. 7e (the inset is the fitted equivalent circuit diagram). It is found that the optimal device exhibits higher recombination resistance (Rrec) than the pristine device, indicating that carrier recombination is effectively inhibited in the optimal device. Subsequently, Mott–Schottky (M–S) measurement was implemented to deeply investigate the mechanism of carrier recombination dynamics and the obtained results are shown in Fig. 7f. The built-in potential (Vbi) calculated by relying on the fit of the M–S plots enhances from 1.06 to 1.19 V for the optimal device. The enhanced Vbi resulting from the low defect density represents both a stronger driving force for carrier transport and an expanded depletion area for effective inhibition of electron–hole recombination, increasing the open-circuit voltage.
The stability test is an essential link to evaluate the performance of perovskite films and devices. From the XRD patterns of the pristine film and the optimal 2D/3D perovskite film heated at 85 °C in a N2 environment for 15 h (Fig. S9†), one can see that the XRD characteristic peaks of the optimal 2D/3D perovskite film markedly enhance after continuous heating, indicating that the optimized film not only has good thermal stability but also has good crystallinity. Furthermore, we examined the hydrophobicity of the perovskite films using XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. S10a.† The results show that the optimized perovskite film has superior hydrophobicity compared to the pristine film placed in an environment of 60% RH for 10 min, and the morphological changes of the films in the inset also confirm the enhancement of the hydrophobicity of the optimized 2D/3D perovskite film. For more accurately understanding the moisture stability of PSCs, we stored the unpackaged devices in an external environment at ∼25% RH for 30 days and found that the optimal device retained ∼72% of the initial efficiency, demonstrating that the optimal device with the 2D/3D heterostructure can retain high performance in the external environment (Fig. S10b†). The increase of water contact angle in the inset also confirms the improved moisture stability of the optimal device. Furthermore, we investigated the long-term stability of the unpackaged devices stored in a dark N2 atmosphere and found that the optimized device exhibited outstanding long-term stability with just 14% PCE loss over 1800 h, indicating that the 2D/3D CsPbI2Br PSC can operate for a long time in a N2 environment (Fig. S10c†).
Finally, motivated by the high-performance 2D/3D CsPbI2Br PSCs, we designed and manufactured monolithic all-PTSCs. The all-PTSC is stacked using a top cell with a composition of 2D/3D CsPbI2Br (1.91 eV) and a bottom cell with a composition of MAPbI3 (1.59 eV), and the structure is ITO/SnO2/2D/3D CsPbI2Br/spiro/PEDOT:PSS/C60/MAPbI3/spiro/Ag, as shown in Fig. 8a. Within the device structure, the MAPbI3 perovskite film was fabricated by thermal evaporation of PbI2 and then converted to perovskite via inter-diffusion of MAI from IPA solution (Fig. S11†). Such a sequential vapor-solution processing method can avoid destruction of top cells in the process of depositing the light-absorbing layer MAPbI3, which is also beneficial for improving the stability of the all-PTSC. More importantly, the IPA-diluted high-transmittance PEDOT:PSS layer deposited by using the dynamic spin coating method can act as both a recombination layer and a partial solvent barrier for the monolithic all-PTSC.

The optimal all-PTSC shows a PCE of 10.22%, with a high Voc of 2.33 V, a Jsc of 8.04 mA cm−2 and an FF of 54.54%. The high Voc of the all-PTSC is close to the sum of the photovoltage of the sub-cells, representing ignorable voltage loss in the recombination layer. Moreover, the integrated Jsc values of the IPCE curves are 7.89 and 7.58 mA cm−2 for the top and bottom cells, respectively, which are consistent with the Jsc measured using the J–V curve (within experimental error). Also, the PCE and Jsc of the J–V curve match with the stable PCE and Jsc measured over 300 s for the all-PTSC and sub-cells within experimental error, indicating the reliability of the J–V curve test results. The cross-sectional SEM image of the monolithic all-PTSC and the corresponding energy band chart are demonstrated in Fig. S12.† Among them, the cross-sectional view shows the intact sub-cells with an n-i-p architecture as well as the intact PEDOT:PSS recombination layer sandwiched between the p-type layer (spiro-OMeTAD) and the n-type layer (C60), and the energy band diagram shows that the PEDOT:PSS recombination layer with high conductivity provides recombination sites for holes and electrons from different sub-cells, and realizes the functions of carrier extraction and transport.

As for unencapsulated monolithic all-PTSCs based on 2D/3D CsPbI2Br PSCs, we carried out thermal stability testing on the device in a dark N2 environment at 85 °C (Fig. 9a). It was found that the tandem device efficiency changed to 84% initial efficiency after standing for 300 h, indicating good thermal stability of the 2D/3D CsPbI2Br PSC-based monolithic all-PTSC. Again, we investigated the air stability of the unpackaged monolithic all-PTSC and found that the tandem device efficiency becomes 96% initial efficiency after 350 h in air with 15% RH, indicating excellent air stability of the tandem device. The stability results suggest that 2D/3D CsPbI2Br PSCs are some of the optimal choices to fabricate stable monolithic all-PTSCs.

Conclusion
In summary, we used a simple and effective cation exchange method to form a 2D/3D heterostructure, that is, by coating BABr on the all-inorganic perovskite absorption layer, where the top structure of the 3D perovskite layer is transformed into an ultra-thin quasi-2D perovskite layer. Experimental studies show that the 2D/3D heterostructure can not only improve the hydrophobicity of perovskite films, and reduce film defects and non-radiative recombination, but also adjust the energy band arrangement of the perovskite layer to achieve higher performance of the final device. As a result, the optimal 2D/3D CsPbI2Br device delivers a remarkable PCE of 16.57% with improved stability. Based on the above, we fabricated a monolithic all-PTSC with an ultra-high open-circuit voltage of 2.33 V and a PCE of 10.22%, where the 2D/3D CsPbI2Br PSC is the top cell, the MAPbI3 PSC is the bottom cell, and the solution-processed PEDOT:PSS film is the recombination layer. Furthermore, the monolithic all-PTSC shows good stability and maintains 96% initial efficiency for 350 h in air at 15% RH, and 84% initial efficiency for 300 h in a N2 atmosphere at 85 °C. Our findings demonstrate that 2D/3D heterostructured CsPbI2Br solar cells are a good choice for top cells in monolithic all-perovskite tandem devices.

Device fabrication

Fabrication of the top cell 2D/3D CsPbI2Br PSC. 
Deionized water, ethanol and IPA were used for ultrasonication of glass/ITO substrates (Xiang Sci. Tech. Co., 8 Ω m−2) for 30 min, respectively, and then irradiated using UVO plasma for 20 min to eliminate organics. 15 wt% SnO2 colloidal dispersion was diluted to 2.5 wt% and stirred for more than 2 h to obtain a homogeneous solution. The SnO2 ETL was deposited at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 30 min. Next, the 1.2 M CsPbI2Br precursor solution was prepared by dissolving CsI, PbI2 and PbBr2 in 1 mL DMSO at a ratio of 1.2:0.6:0.6. The 3D CsPbI2Br film was deposited through multi-step spin-coating, i.e., 500 rpm for 5 s and 4000 rpm for 30 s, and then the 3D film was annealed in two steps: 3 min at 45 °C and 10 min at 160 °C. After mixing BABr (0.1, 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 mg) and 10 mL of DMSO in 990 mL of CB, the quasi-2D perovskite film was deposited through spin coating the BABr solution at 5000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 150 °C for 5 min. Subsequently, the spiro-OMeTAD HTL was deposited by spin-coating at 2500 rpm for 30 s through combining 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 μL TBP, 17.5 μL Li-TFSI, and 29 μL FK209 in 1 mL CB. In the end, 80 nm Ag was thermally vaporized as the electrode.


Fabrication of the monolithic all-PTSC. 
Firstly, the SnO2 ETL, 3D CsPbI2Br layer, quasi-2D perovskite layer, and spiro-OMeTAD HTL were deposited using the same process as above, and the formed samples were then oxidized in a drying oven for 3 h. PEDOT:PSS solution (the volume ratio of PEDOT:PSS and IPA is 1:4) was then dynamically spun on the HTL at 6000 rpm for 30 s, and heated at 80 °C for 10 min. After PEDOT:PSS recombination layer deposition, the substrates were moved to the vacuum coating room to thermally evaporate 30 nm of C60 at 0.2 Å s−1 followed by 115 nm of PbI2 at 3 Å s−1. After the substrates were moved to a N2 glovebox, 30 mg mL−1 MAI solution was spin-coated at 2500 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 30 min. Then, the spiro-OMeTAD HTL was deposited with the same process as described above. In the end, 80 nm Ag was thermally vaporized as the electrode.
