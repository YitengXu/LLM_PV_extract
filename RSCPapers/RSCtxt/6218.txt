    , Accepted 24th June 2020First published on 25th June 2020AbstractInorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite has gained great attention due to its outstanding overall stability and great potential for application in semitransparent and tandem solar cells. However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of CsPbI2Br-based perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) are being limited by their severe energy loss (Eloss) due to the unfavorable device interface and defects. Here, an intermeshing SnO2 (Im-SnO2) electron transporting layer (ELF) is subtly constructed by combining two types of SnO2 with complementary electronic/physical properties for suppressing the notorious Eloss. With this strategy, the defects of the conventional SnO2 ETL can be greatly improved, which could simultaneously facilitate charge extraction, increase the crystallinity and orientation of CsPbI2Br films, and form a cascade energy level in the device. Consequently, the Eloss of CsPbI2Br pero-SCs can be remarkably reduced to below 0.6 eV, delivering an excellent PCE of 16.10% with a Voc as high as 1.31 V. To the best of our knowledge, these results are among the best reported for a few CsPbI2Br pero-SCs that enable high Voc without sacrificing efficiency. In addition, the devices show high stability under both strong UV irradiation for 300 h and an ambient atmosphere for 1000 h.
Introduction
Recently, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) have gained unprecedented fast-rising power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–3 Unfortunately, the intrinsically volatile organic cation components (such as formamidinium and methylammonium), which lead to poor photo and thermal stabilities, have been considered to be the biggest hurdles for their commercialization.4–6 Therefore, developing all-inorganic perovskite materials by replacing the organic components with inorganic components, such as cesium (Cs+), may fundamentally address the instability issues.7–9
Among the various all-inorganic perovskite materials, CsPbI2Br with a high Goldschmidt tolerance factor (0.84) has garnered extensive attention in terms of stability,10 and its reasonably wide bandgap of 1.90 eV also endows it with great potential for application in semitransparent and tandem solar cells.11,12 The active layer material in each sub-cell of tandem solar cells should not only prevent PCE deterioration during the multiple layer-by-layer processes and post-treatments, such as thermal annealing,13,14 the related sub-cells also need to have high open-circuit voltage (Voc).15,16 However, the Voc of the devices is limited by severe energy loss (Eloss = Eg − eVoc).17 As seen from the Eloss statistics of highly efficient Cs-based all-inorganic pero-SCs with different ratios of I to Br (Fig. 1a and Table S1†), the severe Eloss, generally in the range of 0.65–0.85 eV, is a common issue in all types of all-inorganic pero-SCs, and only a few devices have achieved Eloss values close to 0.6 eV. There are two possible reasons for the high Eloss.18 One is that the prevailing trap-state density and poor morphology of CsPbI2Br perovskite films may cause severe non-radiative recombination.19 To address this issue, many studies have been conducted to prepare a high-quality CsPbI2Br film by optimizing deposition methods20,21 or using ion doping22–24 or by optimizing the wettability and roughness of deposition substrates.25

Interface defects and a mismatched energy level between the perovskite layer and the interface layer were also considered to be other critical factors influencing charge carrier recombination.26,27 Yang et al. found that the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) hole transporting layer (HTL) with low energy disorder could not only reduce its trap states but could also more efficiently passivate the surface defects of CsPbI2Br, which promote charge extraction and result in a high Voc of 1.30 V for the pero-SCs.28 Sang et al. synthesized a series of HTL materials to fine-tune their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels. CsPbI2Br pero-SCs based on poly-indenofluoren-8-triarylamine (PIF8-TAA) HTL with a deeper-lying HOMO energy level showed a Voc as high as 1.31 V.29 Unfortunately, although these optimized devices successfully reduced Eloss, the tradeoff between Voc and FF/Jsc still led to unfavorable efficiencies lower than 15%. Recently, Yip et al. employed a dual interfacial engineering approach with respect to the energy levels of both the HTL and ETL. The well-matched energy level alignment of the resultant device effectively weakened the charge transport barrier, leading to low non-radiative recombination. As a result, the trade-off behavior between Voc and FF/Jsc was effectively avoided and the device simultaneously realized a high Voc of 1.30 V and high PCE of 16.2%.30 Although this strategy is successful, it requires precise simultaneous control of the dual interfacial layer. Nonetheless, we also found that the optimized SnO2 with PN4N can significantly boost the Voc from 1.08 V to 1.24 V, and PCE is improved from 12.3% to 15.1%, which emphasized the significant influence of the bottom ETL on the final device performance.
Numerous studies have also revealed that the performance of pero-SCs is very sensitive to the bottom interface properties, such as wettability, roughness, carrier mobility, and defects. For example, Huang et al. proposed that a highly hydrophobic interface layer could suppress heterogeneous nucleation, facilitating the growth of a perovskite film with a large grain size.31 Zhang et al. claimed that low-roughness substrates benefit a smooth-surface perovskite film.32 Therefore, the underlying ETL in the n–i–p pero-SCs plays a critical role in the resulting perovskite film quality. Among the various ETL materials, TiO2 still dominates CsPbI2Br-based devices.24 Unfortunately, the photonic instability and the high-temperature annealing process of TiO2 hamper its further application in pero-SCs. SnO2 with high conductivity and fewer oxygen vacancies have attracted considerable attention as the ETL, and it has successfully realized several record efficiencies in organic–inorganic hybrid pero-SCs.19,33–35 Colloid SnO2 (Col-SnO2) as one of the most widely used types of SnO2 possesses a high-lying conduction band maximum (Ec), which can well match with that of CsPbI2Br. However, its high wettability to the precursor solution and enlarged energy level offset with the work function (WF) of indium tin oxide (ITO) would lead to a small grain size of the CsPbI2Br crystal and unfavorable ohmic contact, respectively.30,32 Although nanoparticle-type SnO2 (NP-SnO2) with a confinement effect could reduce Ec and enhance the hydrophobic surface, the mismatched Ec between the ETL and perovskite and the rough surface of NP-SnO2 are harmful to the charge extraction and perovskite growth.36 Therefore, a bilayer ETL with different SnO2 nanoparticles37,38 or partially ion-doping SnO239,40 was proposed to improve surface morphology or optimize energy levels with the aim to facilitate perovskite growth and charge carrier extraction. Unfortunately, some new problems arose: (1) an incompatible interface between the heterojunction bilayer SnO2 (with/without doping) can introduce an undesirable recombination and (2) uneven dispersion of dopants in SnO2 may give rise to an impurity phase, leading to heterogeneous carrier mobility in the bilayer SnO2 ETL, thus influencing the carrier transport. Therefore, it is urgent to develop SnO2-based ETLs, which can maintain low defects and form good electronic contact and favorable energy level alignment with CsPbI2Br and even ITO, for achieving low Eloss and high performance.41,42
In this work, an intermeshing SnO2 (Im-SnO2) ETL strategy was proposed to reduce Eloss for high PCE by subtly combining two types of SnO2 with complementary electronic/physical properties. Rational combination of the two types of SnO2 especially constructing an intermeshing contact can break the “bucket effect” limitation, simultaneously achieving a compact and smooth ETL surface with favorable wettability and high electron mobility, which are superior to those of single SnO2 films. Importantly, this intermeshing ETL can not only facilitate CsPbI2Br film growth with a compact, high crystal orientation and large-grain-size morphology but also further suppress the oxygen vacancies that exist in SnO2 to reduce the photocatalytic degradation properties. The gradually decreased Ec of Im-SnO2 leads to desirable cascade energy levels between the perovskite and the ITO electrode for efficient electron transport, leading to improved charge extraction efficiency and suppressed interfacial trap-assisted recombination. With this strategy, the Eloss of CsPbI2Br pero-SCs was greatly reduced below 0.6 eV, showing a PCE of 16.10% with a Voc of 1.31 V. The device stability under both strong UV irradiation and the ambient atmosphere was also significantly improved.
Results and discussion
The Im-SnO2 ETL was simply constructed by successively coating two types of SnO2 precursor solution with optimized concentrations: one is NP-SnO2 obtained by dissolving SnCl2·2H2O in ethanol and the other is Col-SnO2 obtained by diluting colloid SnO2 in deionized water. Considering the diversity and complementarity of morphology and the electrical characteristics of these two types of SnO2 films, the synthesized NP-SnO2 with a deeper-lying Ec close to the WF of ITO is more suitable to serve as the bottom layer. And to exclude the effect of H2O on the prepared NP-SnO2 film, we compared the transmittance spectra of the NP-SnO2 film before and after washing with H2O (Fig. S1†). The completely overlapped transmittance spectra suggest that the subsequently processed Col-SnO2 would not influence the underlying NP-SnO2. It should be noted that the Im-SnO2 fabrication process, including spin coating and thermal annealing, can be fully carried out in an ambient atmosphere with precisely controlled relative humidity (RH ∼ 40%). Use of moderate moisture conditions can not only simplify Im-SnO2 growth by avoiding the tedious atmospheric transfer between air and inert gas but also ensure more efficient oxidation of SnO2. To facilitate the penetration/contact of the two types of SnO2 with each other, additional UV-Ozone (UVO) treatment was carried out before coating the NP-SnO2 film with the Col-SnO2 solution. After coating with Col-SnO2, thermal annealing treatment was conducted to assist its further growth. Therefore, Im-SnO2 with good electronic contact at the NP-SnO2/Col-SnO2 interface was successfully fabricated.
The optical and physical properties of the ETL are critical factors for obtaining high-performance pero-SCs.43 As shown in Fig. 1b, all the SnO2 ETLs deposited on the glass/ITO substrate generally exhibit high average transmittances in the visible region, whereas the obvious differences in shape and intensity, particularly for the Im-SnO2, mean that these ETLs may assemble into different optical structures that greatly influence the incident light pathway. Among these ETLs, the Im-SnO2 ETL shows the highest transmittance in the 500–700 nm range with a maximum value of 92.3% at 550 nm, as also evidenced from the corresponding lower reflection spectra (Fig. 1c). It should be noted that the simply stacking bilayer SnO2 shows a slight fluctuation in transmittance.37 The reduced optical loss of Im-SnO2 has the benefit of harvesting more incident photons. This reduction is attributed to the anti-reflection effect that originated from the different refractive indices (RI) of ITO (RI ≈ 2), NP-SnO2 (RI ≈ 1.71), Col-SnO2 (RI ≈ 1.78) and air (RI ≈ 1), where the alternative high and low RI layers facilitate optical interference at a specific structure.44,45 The distinctive optical properties were also observed in their related optical bandgaps, changing from 3.87 eV to 4.10 eV due to the quantum confinement effects in nanoparticles (Fig. S2b†).46 In addition, these SnO2 materials, like TiO2, are wide-bandgap semiconductor materials but showed much lower absorption intensity in the UV region than that of TiO2 (Fig. S2a†). The weak-UV-light-absorption SnO2 films would have fewer photo-induced electron–hole pairs, such that the desorption of O2− that passivates deep electronic traps caused by oxygen vacancies in the SnO2 lattice is suppressed, which enables obvious improvement of photostability.47–50
The electron mobilities (μe) of NP-SnO2, Col-SnO2 and Im-SnO2 ETL were tested using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method.51 As shown in Fig. 1d and Table S2,† NP-SnO2 shows approximately two-times higher μe than Col-SnO2. When combining NP-SnO2 and Col-SnO2 together, the μe of the resultant Im-SnO2 is not limited by the “bucket effect”; instead, it maintains the electrical properties of the component NP-SnO2 with higher μe.
The morphology and wettability of the ETL can significantly influence the quality of the resultant growing perovskite film. We then performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and water-contact angle measurements to evaluate these characteristics of the Im-SnO2 film and the NP-SnO2/Col-SnO2 film for comparison. As shown in top-view SEM images (Fig. 2a), island-like NP-SnO2 particles, with an average size of 26.39 nm and segregated by voids, were clearly observed. This porous Col-SnO2 film is more likely to cause serious Schottky shunt pathways resulting from the direct contact between the perovskite and the ITO electrode in planar n–i–p pero-SCs.52 However, the Col-SnO2 film shows an obviously different morphology, with closely packed and uniform nanoparticles. It should be noted that the average grain size is 11.95 nm, which is even smaller than that of the voids in the NP-SnO2 film (14.60 nm) (Fig. 2b). Regarding the Im-SnO2 film morphology, the main features of the Col-SnO2 film were maintained, suggesting that the Col-SnO2 growth is less affected by the layer beneath. However, we still observe that the Im-SnO2 film shows slight differences in terms of a higher average grain size of 12.58 nm accompanied by a reduced standard deviation (2.76 nm) and lower root-mean-square roughness (RMS = 1.76 nm, Fig. S3†) than those of the bare Col-SnO2 film. The improved surface would facilitate charge extraction and the all-inorganic perovskite film growth that is highly dependent on the substrate quality. In addition, we found that the total thickness of the respective NP-SnO2 and Col-SnO2 films under the same fabrication conditions as those for Im-SnO2 is 3.5 nm greater than the thickness of the Im-SnO2 film. All thicknesses were accurately measured using an ellipsometer (ESI†). Therefore, we assumed that this thickness deviation is likely caused by the spatial overlap.

(b) Grain size distribution of the NP-SnO2 and Col-SnO2 and statistic void sizes in the NP-SnO2 film; σ represents the standard deviation of the void size. (c) Top-view SEM image of the film obtained by spin-coating the diluted Col-SnO2 solution (7 mg mL−1) on the NP-SnO2 layer. Area A represents the island feature of NP-SnO2 with some small Col-SnO2 grains (white circles) located in the gap of adjacent islands; area B represents the grain feature of Col-SnO2 where thick Col-SnO2 is loosely distributed on the NP-SnO2 film. (d) Schematic illustration of the combination process of NP-SnO2 and Col-SnO2via the intermeshing SnO2 ETL strategy. 
To test this assumption, a four-times-diluted Col-SnO2 solution was spin-coated at a high speed (6000 rpm) onto the bottom NP-SnO2 film. In this case, incompletely covered Col-SnO2 nanoparticles on the NP-SnO2 film surface may help us clearly understand the spatial interface between them. As shown in Fig. 2c, since the diluted Col-SnO2 solution caused the uneven distribution of Col-SnO2 nanoparticles on the NP-SnO2 film, distinct morphologies were observed in the particle shape/size/gap width, which delineates the individual features of the three SnO2 films. Generally, the island-feature of the NP-SnO2 film still dominated the entire film, which was mainly localized in area A, whereas some small grains assigned to Col-SnO2 marked with white circles were observed in the gaps between adjacent islands. This fill-mode morphology is consistent with the speculation of spatial overlap at the interface of NP-SnO2 and Col-SnO2. We also found that these small grains are loosely distributed in area B, where the NP-SnO2 film has already been embedded by the relatively thick Col-SnO2. All these features were solidly confirmed by the consistent average grain sizes and grain shapes with their respective bare control film (Fig. 2a). Therefore, as illustrated in Fig. 2d, the close contact between the two types of SnO2 just like an intermeshing part of gears may deliver a high specific surface area for forming good electronic contact. We also conclude that the obtained Im-SnO2 film consists of a thin Col-SnO2 film localized in the upper layer, bottom NP-SnO2 film and their mixture in an intermeshing structure at the interface. Meanwhile, we investigated the crystallization behaviors of the three types of SnO2 ETLs. As shown in Fig. S4,† no diffraction peak was observed from the XRD pattern of the NP-SnO2 film, suggesting its amorphous nature, because of the low annealing temperature (150 °C) that is far below the NP-SnO2 crystallization temperature (>450 °C).36 In comparison, both Col-SnO2 and Im-SnO2 films exhibit three characteristic diffraction peaks at 26.87°, 34.25° and 52.01°, attributed to the (110), (101) and (211) planes, respectively. This behavior indicated that the crystallization nature of Col-SnO2 could be well maintained in Im-SnO2 even when growing on an amorphous NP-SnO2 layer.
To investigate the influence of these SnO2-ETLs on the quality of the sequential growth perovskite film, one-step deposited CsPbI2Br films with gradient thermal annealing were employed.53 As shown in Fig. 3a, CsPbI2Br films can grow well on these SnO2 ETLs, forming compact and pinhole-free morphologies but with obvious differences in grain sizes and uniformity. The CsPbI2Br film grown on the Col-SnO2 ETL shows an average grain size of 497.13 nm, while average sizes of 790.07 nm and 713.11 nm were obtained for the CsPbI2Br films grown on the NP-SnO2 and Im-SnO2 ETLs, respectively (Fig. S5†). The enlarged grain sizes may result from the relatively higher water/DMSO contact angles (Fig. S6†), which would suppress the nucleus formation, providing sufficient space for crystal growth.30 Furthermore, we found that the CsPbI2Br film on Im-SnO2 displayed a more uniform grain size distribution with a standard deviation of 260.03 nm than NP-SnO2 (295.32 nm), which is ascribed to the smooth surface and moderate wettability of Im-SnO2. The quality of these perovskite films was further investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As shown in Fig. 3b, all the CsPbI2Br films show a pure α-phase with the same three characteristic peaks at 14.47°, 20.66° and 29.38°, attributed to the (100), (110) and (200) planes, respectively.54 However, the distinct diffraction intensities, particularly for the (100) and (200) planes, indicate that there is an obvious difference in the microscopic crystals of the films. The smaller full width half maximum (FWHM) values of (100) and (200) planes (Fig. S7†) in the perovskite films grown on Col-SnO2 and Im-SnO2 ETLs suggest higher crystallinity.55 It is worth mentioning that there is a slight blue-shift diffraction peak at (100) and (200) planes for the perovskite grown on Col-SnO2 and Im-SnO2 compared with that on NP-SnO2, which is probably caused by the formed I-rich perovskite film at the interface of the Col-SnO2 or Im-SnO2/perovskite. Because the K+ in the stabilizer (KOH) of the colloidal SnO2 could bind with the Br− of the perovskite lattice through substitutional reaction,56 the loss of the Br− resulted in an I-rich perovskite film leading to the lattice expansion.

(b) XRD patterns and (c) intensity ratio of (100)/(110) and (200)/(110) calculated from corresponding XRD patterns of the perovskite films based on NP-SnO2, Col-SnO2 and Im-SnO2 ETLs. (d) UPS spectra of NP-SnO2, Col-SnO2 and Im-SnO2. (e) The corresponding energy-level diagrams of the pero-SCs, where EVAC is the vacuum level, and EF is the Fermi level. 
The highest ratio of the (100) and (200) peaks to the other peaks, such as (110) in the CsPbI2Br film grown on the Im-SnO2 ETL, reveals that Im-SnO2 is more likely to induce perovskite to grow along the (100) and (200) planes (Fig. 3c). The strong lattice orientation perpendicular to the substrate is beneficial for the charge transport.57
In addition to the quality of the CsPbI2Br film, the matched energy levels between the ETL and CsPbI2Br and between the ETL and ITO also have an essential impact on the final device performance. Therefore, the exact electronic structures of these SnO2-based ETLs as well as CsPbI2Br were then measured by ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. 3d and S8†). The WF, valence band (Ev), and Ec of NP-SnO2 and Col-SnO2 films were estimated according to the cutoff edge of the binding energy and optical bandgaps; these results are illustrated in Fig. 3e and summarized in Table S3.† The Im-SnO2 ETL provides a cascade Ec between ITO and the CsPbI2Br layer,26,58 accompanied by a gradually deepening WF close to that of ITO. Meanwhile, we found that the WF and Ec of Im-SnO2 are located between those of NP-SnO2 and Col-SnO2, which indicated that an electronic coupling occurred between the two types of SnO2. Considering the similar depths between UPS/KPFM detection (approximately 10 nm) and the spatial overlap region (Fig. S9†), the UPS and KPFM signals are likely to be collected from the spatial overlap region, where the electronic coupling occurred. The intermediate band energy values located between NP-SnO2 and Col-SnO2 would be favorable for the formation of desirable cascade energy levels. These phenomena are also evidenced by their consistency with the results of the Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), in accordance with the surface potential images shown in Fig. S10.† Combined with the well-maintained electron mobility of Im-SnO2, this intermeshing-structure SnO2 ETL would provide an effective electron transportation pathway from the CsPbI2Br to the ITO electrode. In addition, the deep Ev of both SnO2 ETLs exhibits suitable hole-blocking properties with improved electron selectivity at the cathode.50
With all these data, we fabricated pero-SCs with a configuration of ITO/ETL/CsPbI2Br/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD)/Au. As shown in Fig. 4a and S11,† all the layers with distinct features were clearly distinguished in the cross-sectional SEM images of the devices. The CsPbI2Br film grown on Im-SnO2 ETLs with uniform, compact and large-grain characteristics exhibited a thickness as high as 430 nm and fewer grain boundaries perpendicular to the substrate; this could effectively minimize the grain-boundary energy and the trap-state density in the perovskite film.

(b) Schematic illustration of the charge transporting process at the interface between the ETL and CsPbI2Br based on NP-SnO2, Col-SnO2, and Im-SnO2. (c) J–V characteristics of pero-SCs under the illumination of AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2. (d) EQE spectra and integrated curves of the corresponding pero-SCs. (e) Device performance distribution for 36 devices in one batch. (f) Maximal steady-state photocurrent and PCE output of champion devices at a maximum power point (0.94 V for the pero-SCs with the NP-SnO2 ETL, 0.95 V for the pero-SCs with the Col-SnO2 ETL, and 1.00 V for the pero-SCs with the Im-SnO2 ETL). 

Fig. 4c shows the typical J–V characteristics of the champion pero-SCs based on different ETLs; the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. We also proposed the effect of the various ETLs on the charge transporting behavior, as illustrated in Fig. 4b. The NP-SnO2-based device shows a PCE of 13.45% with a Voc of 1.22 V, a Jsc of 15.07 mA cm−2 and an FF of 73.18%. The inferior FF is attributed to the random-orientation CsPbI2Br film and electronic shunt pathways produced by the porous NP-SnO2 ETL. As shown in Fig. 4b, these shunt pathways are likely to trigger serious carrier recombination. In comparison, the PCE of the Col-SnO2-based device was increased to 14.11% with a Voc of 1.20 V, a Jsc of 15.44 mA cm−2, and an FF of 76.15%. The Jsc and FF were improved to a certain extent due to the densely packed Col-SnO2 grains. The pinhole-free and continuous Col-SnO2 ETL could effectively prevent CsPbI2Br from directly coming into contact with ITO thus benefiting the charge separation and transport. However, the approximately 20 mV Voc decline suggested that an enlarged Voc loss occurred, which is likely caused by the small grain size of CsPbI2Br as well as the large energy level offset between Ec of Col-SnO2 and WF of ITO. Interestingly, when using Im-SnO2 as the ETL, both the continuous structure and cascade energy levels of Im-SnO2 would contribute to a high charge extraction efficiency. Combining the high-quality CsPbI2Br film grown on Im-SnO2, the resulting device undoubtedly showed a reduced current leakage and recombination paths. As a result, the champion pero-SC showed a remarkable PCE of 16.10% with overall improved photovoltaic parameters: a Voc of 1.31 V, a Jsc of 15.53 mA cm−2, and an FF of 79.13%. It should be noted that a Voc as high as 1.31 V is among the best reported for a few CsPbI2Br-based pero-SCs that show an Eloss below 0.6 eV while simultaneously exhibiting a promising PCE over 16%. In addition, all the Jsc values matched well with the values calculated by integrating the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 4d) within 2% deviation (Table 1). Fig. 4e and S12† show the statistical histogram of the PCEs and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of pero-SCs based on NP-SnO2, Col-SnO2, and Im-SnO2 ETLs, respectively. The narrower distribution of Im-SnO2-based devices indicates good reproducibility which is another important factor for high-performance pero-SCs. To solidly confirm the PCE of champion pero-SCs based on the different SnO2 ETLs, the maximum steady-state output photocurrent was tracked under the illumination of AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2. As shown in Fig. 4f, the corresponding output efficiency could be stabilized to 12.79%, 13.70%, and 15.60% within 200 s for NP-SnO2-, Col-SnO2- and Im-SnO2-based pero-SCs, respectively, which were very close to the results obtained from the J–V curve. We also investigated the influence of SnO2 ETL thickness on the device performance; we tested the thicknesses of optimized SnO2 ETLs, which are approximately 22 nm, 20 nm and 32 nm for NP-SnO2, Col-SnO2 and Im-SnO2 ETLs, respectively. For comparison, we fabricated NP-SnO2 and Col-SnO2 ETLs with the same thickness as that of the Im-SnO2 ETL. In contrast, a thicker NP-SnO2 or Col-SnO2 ETL would deteriorate the device performance (Table S4†). Therefore, the improved device performance based on the Im-SnO2 ETL is ascribed to the intermeshing structure of the ETL with favorable electronic properties rather than a thicker ETL. To further demonstrate the advantage of such an intermeshing SnO2 ETL, we fabricated the Col-SnO2/NP-SnO2 ETL by reversing the sequence of the two types of SnO2. As shown in Fig. S13,† the device performance significantly deteriorated compared to that of the device based on Im-SnO2 (NP–SnO2/Col-SnO2), especially for the Voc, which is probably ascribed to the mismatched energy levels and porous characteristics of the top Col-SnO2, thus increasing the charge carrier recombination and current leakage.

To better understand the role of charge transfer dynamics that are affected by the SnO2 ETL in improving device efficiency, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay measurements were conducted. As seen from the steady-state PL spectra in Fig. 5a, the PL intensity of CsPbI2Br based on Im-SnO2 was significantly quenched compared with that based on a single NP-SnO2 or Col-SnO2 ETL. This result suggests that the intermeshing SnO2 ETL can extract electrons from the perovskite film more efficiently. The enhanced charge extraction ability is ascribed to the synergistic effect of the high electron mobility and cascade energy levels of Im-SnO2 that facilitate charge transfer and transport, which can well explain the strong enhancement of Voc in the related pero-SCs.59 A TRPL decay measurement was then performed; the lifetime was fitted with a biexponential function, as shown in Fig. 5a, and the detailed parameters are listed in Table S5.† Generally, the fast decay component (τ1) is attributed to the quenching of charge carriers at the interface, and the low decay component (τ2) is related to the radiative recombination induced by the defects in the bulk.60 Obviously, the CsPbI2Br grown on Im-SnO2 exhibited a significantly shortened τ1 with a dominating ratio (91.62%). This result again confirmed that this intermeshing SnO2 ETL benefits the charge extraction ability. Accordingly, the τ2 of CsPbI2Br on NP-SnO2, Col-SnO2 and Im-SnO2 gradually decreased, accompanied by reduced ratios. This result demonstrated that Im-SnO2 could facilitate CsPbI2Br growth with fewer defects to minimize charge recombination, owing to its enlarged grain size, fewer grain boundaries, and high crystal orientation.61,62

To quantitatively analyze the trap density of CsPbI2Br films grown on the various SnO2-based ETLs, electron-only devices with the ITO/ETL/CsPbI2Br/PCBM/Al structure are fabricated and characterized using the SCLC model. As shown in Fig. 5b, the linear region at a low bias voltage shows a typical ohmic behavior, as well as a trap-filling limited (TFL) region at intermediate voltages and a trap-free space charge limit current (SCLC) region at high voltages. The kink point between the ohmic region and the trap-filling region is defined as the trap-filling limit voltage (VTFL); therefore, the trap density (nt) in devices can be calculated from nt = 2εε0VTFL/eL2.56 The trap-state densities within the perovskite layer were calculated to be 4.40 × 1015, 3.24 × 1015 and 2.44 × 1015 cm−3 for the devices based on NP-SnO2, Col-SnO2 and Im-SnO2 ETLs, respectively. The reduced trap-state density of the device based on the Im-SnO2 ETL can be attributed to the high quality of perovskite crystals and their increased grain size.
To deeply understand the influence of the trap state on the charge recombination kinetics in the operating device, we characterized the dependence of Voc on the various incident light intensities (Plight), given that Voc ∝ (nkT/q)ln(Plight), where a slope of Vocversus ln(Plight) deviated from kT/q, suggesting a trap-assisted recombination.63 Under open-circuit conditions, the device based on the Im-SnO2 ETL showed the smallest slope among the three devices (Fig. 5c), owing to the reduced trap-assisted recombination; this is consistent with the above-calculated trap density. That is, the population of non-radiative recombination in the perovskite film is effectively suppressed by improving the CsPbI2Br quality grown on Im-SnO2 compared to that grown on NP-SnO2 and Col-SnO2.
To evaluate the reduced non-radiative recombination in fully operating devices overall, the J–V curves were measured in the dark; the results are shown in Fig. 5d. The ideality factor (η) and saturation current (Jsat) were calculated by fitting the exponential regime of the dark J–V curves in accordance with the following equations:  JD = Jsat(eqV/ηkT − 1)where JD is the dark current, Jsat is the saturation current, q is the elemental charge, V is the applied bias, η is the diode ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. The calculated parameters are listed in Table S6.† The η of the device with the Im-SnO2 ETL exhibits a value of 1.56, which is much lower than those of the devices based on NP-SnO2 (2.88) and Col-SnO2 (2.16). Furthermore, Jsat is calculated to be 1.21 × 10−11 mA cm−2 for the Im-SnO2-based device, which is five orders of magnitude lower than that of the NP-SnO2-based device (4.06 × 10−6 mA cm−2) and two orders of magnitude lower than that of the Col-SnO2-based device (2.57 × 10−9 mA cm−2). The significantly improved η and Jsat indicate that carrier recombination is suppressed in the Im-SnO2-based device. The results also explain the improvement of Voc for the device based on Im-SnO2.64
To further elucidate the possible mechanism of the enhancement of Voc, capacitance–voltage (C−2–V) plots for the devices based on the different SnO2 ETLs were measured. The built-in potential (Vbi) was obtained using the Mott–Schottky equation. As shown in Fig. S14,† the device based on Im-SnO2 demonstrates the highest Vbi of 1.22 V, compared with the NP-SnO2-based device (1.17 V) and Col-SnO2-based device (1.19 V). A higher Vbi means that the built-in electric field in the perovskite active layer is enhanced, which is beneficial for the charge transfer and thus leads to the increase in Voc. All these findings indicate that the improvements in interfaces and the perovskite film quality are responsible for the enhanced photovoltaic performance of the pero-SCs with the Im-SnO2 ETL.
Stability is a critical issue for the practical applications of pero-SCs. Given the unfavorable photocatalytic degradation and poor moisture stability of CsPbI2Br, we monitored the PCE evolution of unencapsulated CsPbI2Br pero-SCs based on different SnO2 ETLs under strong UV light (100 mW cm−2) and an ambient atmosphere with low relative humidity (RH) conditions, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6a, the NP-SnO2-based pero-SCs retained 82% of their initial efficiencies after 300 h UV-light irradiation, while the PCEs of Col-SnO2 and Im-SnO2-based devices maintained approximately 91% of their initial values. This result revealed that the oxygen-vacancy defects triggering photocatalytic degradation are more prevalent in NP-SnO2 than in Col-SnO2 and Im-SnO2. The similar UV-light stability of Col-SnO2 and Im-SnO2-based devices is likely due to the following reasons: 1. the photostability of high-quality CsPbI2Br is inherently high and 2. the oxygen vacancies of NP-SnO2 in Im-SnO2 could be repaired/suppressed by filled Col-SnO2. When keeping the devices in an ambient atmosphere (RH ∼ 30%, 25 °C), both the Col-SnO2 and Im-SnO2-based pero-SCs retain approximately 96% of their initial efficiencies after 1000 h (Fig. 6b), while only 86% was retained for the device with the NP-SnO2 ETL. The improved moisture stability of the Col-SnO2 and Im-SnO2-based pero-SCs is attributed to their high-quality CsPbI2Br films. The overall enhanced stabilities of the Col-SnO2 and Im-SnO2-based pero-SCs should be ascribed to both their reduced defects in the bottom ETL and the improved perovskite quality.

Conclusion
In conclusion, a subtle and effective intermeshing SnO2 ETL was introduced for suppressing Eloss in CsPbI2Br pero-SCs. By utilizing the complementary electronic/physical properties between NP-SnO2 and Col-SnO2, the resultant Im-SnO2 ETL with an intermeshing contact has notable advantages over each single SnO2 ETL, including a smooth surface, high electron mobility, favorable wettability and optimized band energy levels. As a result, this remarkable Im-SnO2 ETL can well assist the CsPbI2Br perovskite growth in forming a compact and large-grain-size morphology with high crystallinity and favorable crystal orientation, and it also established cascade energy levels between CsPbI2Br and cathode ITO, beneficial for defect reduction and charge transport. The CsPbI2Br pero-SCs with the Im-SnO2 ETL showed a promising PCE of 16.10%, and are one of the few CsPbI2Br pero-SCs that exhibit efficiencies over 16%. Importantly, this efficient device also exhibits a tremendous reduction in Eloss of 0.59 eV and enables the Voc to surpass 1.3 V. The overall improved unencapsulated device stability under strong UV illumination and an ambient atmosphere can further confirm the great contribution of the well-designed intermeshing SnO2 ETL. Therefore, this method provides insights into interface design in all-inorganic pero-SCs that will be helpful to further boost device performance in this emergent field.
