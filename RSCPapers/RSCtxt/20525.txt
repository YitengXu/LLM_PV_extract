    , Accepted 25th April 2017First published on 25th April 2017AbstractIn the development of photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production, designing and optimizing photocatalyst nanostructures with efficient charge transfer and separation for catalytically active sites are still a great challenge. Herein, a well-controlled synthetic strategy is developed to prepare an Mo2C/TiO2 hetero-nanostructure, in which the TiO2 3D hierarchical configuration is loaded with highly dispersed Mo2C nanoparticles. This heterostructure achieves the excellent photocatalytic activity of 39.4 mmol h−1 g−1 with its rate ∼25 times higher than that of pristine TiO2. Also, our photocatalysts process excellent long-term durability (>20 h). The impressive photocatalytic H2 activity of Mo2C/TiO2 indicates favourable charge carrier dynamics, as determined by the results of photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), surface photovoltage (SPV), and open circuit potential (OCP) decay curves. Moreover, this study provides a guide for researchers to design new functional materials with excellent hydrogen production activity.
1. Introduction
In response to the sustainable energy crisis and the corresponding environmental concerns, achieving clean and renewable fuels, such as hydrogen (H2), from water via the process of photocatalysis has attracted much1–4 because H2 possesses a high energy density, low-cost, and non-polluting characteristics.3,4 Semiconductors, such as TiO2-based materials, have been extensively used as photocatalysts in the reduction half-reactions of artificial photosynthesis systems because of their suitable band gap, photostability, nontoxicity, and low cost.5,6 However, unmodified TiO2 displays low efficiency H2 photo-production from water due to its rapid recombination rate of photo-generated charge carriers and high overpotential for H2 production.7,8 Therefore, various strategies have been developed to overcome these abovementioned problems, such as loading cocatalysts to extract electrons for the H+ reduction reaction and construction of heterojunctions to provide efficient transport pathways and facilitate spatial charge separation.9,10 Among them, loading cocatalysts has been extensively considered as one of the most promising approaches because cocatalysts not only speed up electron transport, but also act as electron sinks to provide further charge separation across the interface.11,12 Platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) are usually the most promising cocatalysts for TiO2; however, they are scarce and expensive.13 From this perspective, our research strategy is to identify a suitable cocatalyst to construct an effective, low-priced and accessible photocatalyst structure and achieve high-efficiency charge separation.
Recent studies suggest that some transition metal sulfides, such as MoS2,14,15 NiS,16 CuS,17 and WS2;18 transition metal phosphides, such as Ni2P,19 Cu3P,20 and FeP;21 and transition metal hydroxides, such as Co(OH)2,22 Cu(OH)2,10 and Ni(OH)2,23 are good candidates as cocatalysts to achieve more efficient H2 production. However, significantly, transition metal carbides have rarely been reported. Transition metal carbides, especially molybdenum carbide (Mo2C), have been proven to show promise as low-cost alternatives to Pt catalysts in various catalytic processes dues to their similar electronic density of state to that of Pt and high electrical conductivity.24,25 Thereby, it is expected that higher photocatalytic H2 production rates are achieved when Mo2C cocatalysts are supported on junction-matched TiO2. Furthermore, the structure and morphology of a photocatalytic material are two of the most critical factors in determining its performance owning to the morphology-dependent optical and electrical properties.26 Thus, in this work, TiO2 3D hierarchical configurations are designed as supports for highly dispersed Mo2C NPs since spatially separating photo-generated charge carriers is a feasible approach for enhancing the photocatalytic performance.27
Herein, for the first time, we report a novel photocatalyst heterostructure for highly efficient H2 production, in which TiO2 3D hierarchical configurations are loaded with highly dispersed Mo2C NPs. In this heterostructure, the strong conjugation between the anchored Mo2C NPs and TiO2 supports efficiently inhibits the aggregation of Mo2C NPs. Under solar light irradiation, the photo-generated electrons transfer along the TiO2 branches as a stream of meteor showers and favourably reach the active sites of Mo2C for H+ reduction. As a result, the Mo2C/TiO2 hybrid exhibits drastically enhanced H2 production activity up to 39.4 mmol h−1 g−1 with its rate ∼25 times higher than that of bare TiO2. Accordingly, this type of photocatalyst structure not only exposes dense reactive sites on its surface for H2 production, but also accelerates the transfer of charges and retards the recombination of electron–hole pairs.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals and reagents
Tetrabutyl titanate (C16H36O4Ti, TBOT), ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) and ethanol (CH3CH2OH) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), glucose (C6H12O6), and triethanolamine (TEOA) were purchased from Beijing Chemical Works. All chemical reagents were of analytical grade (AR) and used without any further purification. The deionized water used throughout the experiments was obtained by reverse osmosis followed by ion-exchange and filtration.
2.2. Fabrication of dandelion-like TiO2
Dandelion-like TiO2 was fabricated via a simple solvothermal method. Typically, 1 mL of TBOT was added to 30 mL of frozen acetic acid with vigorous stirring to form a mixture. Then the solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, which was sealed and maintained at 150 °C for 12 h and allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The target product was collected and thoroughly washed with ethanol several times. After drying in an oven at 60 °C for 8 h, the products were calcined at 550 °C for 2 h.
2.3. Fabrication of Mo2C NPs
Mo2C NPs were fabricated via a hydrothermal process, followed by thermal treatment. 1 g of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O together with excess glucose were dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water under magnetic stirring for 30 min. Subsequently, the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, which was sealed and maintained at 180 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the wet precipitates were thoroughly washed and dried in a vacuum oven. Finally, the obtained solid power was treated at 850 °C for 3 h in Ar/H2 at a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 to obtain the Mo2C nanoparticles.
2.4. Fabrication of Mo2C/TiO2 compounds
In a typical experiment, 0.002 g of Mo2C NPs and 0.2 g of dandelion-like TiO2 were dispersed in 50 mL of ethanol. A thoroughly homogeneous solution was obtained by ultrasonication and continuous stirring for 24 h. Subsequently, ethanol was evaporated at 80 °C and the dry power was heated at 300 °C for 1 h in Ar to obtain the target product of 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2. Using the same method, a series of hybrid materials, including 0.25 wt% Mo2C/TiO2, 0.5 wt% Mo2C/TiO2, 2 wt% Mo2C/TiO2 and 4 wt% Mo2C/TiO2, was obtained.
2.5. Characterization
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 spectrometer using monochromatized Al Kα excitation. The crystalline structure of the as-prepared sample was characterized via powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Rigaku D/Max-2550 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) at 50 kV and 200 mA in the 2θ range of 20–80° at a scanning rate of 10° min−1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained with a JEOL JSM 6700F electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained on a Tecnai G2 S-Twin F20 TEM microscope (FEI Company). Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and SEM-EDX element mapping were applied on a HITACHI SU-8020 transmission electron microscope. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was analyzed via a multipoint BET method using adsorption data in the relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.05–0.25. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) of the samples were measured on a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600) detecting absorption over the range of 300–800 nm. Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm were measured on a FLUOROMAX-4. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay spectra were measured on a FLS920 (Edinburgh Instrument).
The lock-in-based surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopic measurement system consisted of a monochromatic light source, a sample cell, a computer, and a lock-in amplifier (SR830-D SP) with a light chopper (SR540). A low chopping frequency of 24 Hz was used. A 500 W xenon lamp (CHF-XM-500 W, Global Xenon Lamp Power) and a grating monochromator (Omni-5007, Zolix) provided monochromatic light. The samples were studied without further treatment during the SPV measurements, and the photovoltaic cell had a structure of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-mica-sample-FTO. The system was calibrated using a DSI200 UV enhanced silicon detector to eliminate the possible phase shift that was not correlated to the SPV response so that any phase retardation reflects the kinetics of the SPV response.
2.6. Photocatalytic H2 production
Photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments were performed with 50 mg of photocatalyst suspended in a 100 mL solution containing 90 mL H2O and 10 mL TEOA in a Pyrex glass reaction cell at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. A 300 W Xe lamp with cooling water (the temperature was stabilized at 277 K) served as the simulated solar light source to trigger the photocatalytic reaction. Hydrogen gas production was analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (GC-8A, Shimadzu Co., Japan, with N2 as the carrier gas) equipped with an MS-5A column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was measured and calculated according to the following equation:28 (1)
2.7. Photoelectrochemical measurements
The electrochemical analysis was carried out using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI760E Instruments) with a standard three-electrode cell using the prepared sample films, a Pt foil and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the working electrodes, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The working electrodes were prepared as follows: 10 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in a mixture solution containing 125 μL of ethanol, 375 μL of deionized water and 50 μL of naphthol by sonication at room temperature to obtain the ink solution. Then, 30 μL of ink was coated onto an FTO electrode via the doctor blade method. Next, the resulting electrodes were air dried and heated at 120 °C for 1 h in an oven before use. Mott–Schottky (M–S) measurements were carried out in the above mentioned three electrode system and recorded over an AC frequency of 1 kHz in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The transient photocurrents and I–t curves were obtained in the above mentioned three electrode system at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl under simulated solar light irradiation provided by a 300 W Xe lamp and 1 M KOH aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed both in the dark and under simulated solar light irradiation by applying an AC voltage with a 5 mV amplitude in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz under open circuit potential conditions in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. Open circuit potential (OCP) decay curves were obtained after turning off the simulated solar light irradiation in 1 M KOH aqueous solution.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Material characterization
The designed synthetic process for the facile fabrication of the 3D Mo2C/TiO2 heterostructure is shown in Fig. 1. Initially, the dandelion-like TiO2 3D hierarchical structure is synthesized via a solvothermal method using tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) and acetic acid as precursors, and thermal treatment in air at 550 °C for 2 h. Also, pure Mo2C NPs were fabricated via a hydrothermal method using ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) and glucose as precursors and thermal treatment at 850 °C for 3 h under Ar. Subsequently, the uniform deposition of Mo2C on the surface of TiO2 occurs by stirring and evaporating the thoroughly homogeneous ethanol solution in the precursor composite of TiO2 and Mo2C. Finally, the perfect Mo2C/TiO2 composite is achieved after heating at 300 °C for 1 h under Ar.

Detailed characterization and crystalline structure of the Mo2C/TiO2 composite were investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. 2. The typical SEM images of 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2 (Fig. 2A–D) present the morphology of 3D dandelion-like structures with diameters ranging from 2 to 3 μm. Fig. 2E and F show the TEM images of 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2, in which compared to that of pure TiO2 (Fig. S1†) Mo2C NPs with diameters of less than 10 nm grown on TiO2 uniformly can clearly be seen. The SEM (Fig. S2†) and TEM images (Fig. S3†) of pure Mo2C reveal its morphology of NPs. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images in Fig. 2G1 and G2 distinctly reveal two types of lattice fringe spacings of 0.238 and 0.228 nm, which correspond well with the (004) and (101) planes of TiO2 and Mo2C, respectively. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy element-mapping analysis in Fig. 2H verifies the presence of Ti, O, Mo, and C, and the EDX spectrum in Fig. S4† further illustrates the good dispersion of Mo2C NPs on the surface of the dandelion-like TiO2. The specific surface areas of TiO2 and 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2 are 104.0 and 105.6 m2 g−1, respectively, based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis, which show that there is no significant surface area improvement after the loading of Mo2C (Fig. S5†).

The crystallographic structure and composition of the composites were also investigated via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XRD patterns of TiO2 and Mo2C suggest anatase (JCPDF: 65-5714) and hexagonal β-Mo2C (JCPDF: 35-0787) structures, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3A. Only the TiO2 phase, such as (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220), and (215), is observed, no phases of (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), and (112) exist for Mo2C, although it is the 4 wt% Mo2C/TiO2 sample (Fig. S6†). These phenomena imply a trace amount of Mo2C in the Mo2C/TiO2 hybrid.

Furthermore, XPS was conducted to confirm the existence of Mo2C in the composite as well as to investigate the strong electronic interactions between Mo2C and TiO2, as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3B shows a comparison of the Ti 2p and O 1s XPS spectra for TiO2 and 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2, respectively, which confirms the normal state of Ti4+ and O2− for TiO2.29 Interestingly, compared with pure TiO2, the Ti 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 XPS peaks together with the O 1s peak of the Mo2C/TiO2 hybrid shift to higher binding energies (BEs), which suggests that strong chemical bonding between Mo2C and TiO2 is formed,30 which is elaborated as follows. Fig. 3C contains the Mo 3d XPS spectra of the Mo2C/TiO2 composite, in which the peaks at 231.7 and 227.9 eV correspond to Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 of Mo–C in Mo2C,31,32 and that at 235.5 and 232.4 eV correspond to Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 of Mo–O in MoO3,33,34 respectively, probably due to exposure in air. In addition, the C 1s peak of the Mo2C/TiO2 composite is also present. It is clear that the peaks at 284.6 and 287.4 eV correspond to C–C (graphitic carbon)31 and C–O,32 respectively, and no Mo–C (carbidic peak) is observed. This is because the graphitic carbon signal is covered by the signal of the surface carbon due to their similar binding energy region.31 It is worth mentioning that compared with the C 1s peak of pure Mo2C (Fig. S7†), the extra peak of C–O (287.4 eV) for Mo2C/TiO2 may originate from the formed C–O–Ti.32 Therefore, the XPS results evidenced that the phenomenon of electron transfer exists between Mo2C and TiO2 during photocatalytic reaction.
3.2. Optical properties
The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) of TiO2, Mo2C, and the 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2 hybrid are presented in Fig. 4A. TiO2 presents a clear edge at around 400 nm, which is derived from the band–band transition of TiO2.35 With regard to the Mo2C/TiO2 composite, over the wavelength range of 400–800 nm, it shows a much increased light-harvesting ability compared to pure TiO2, which plays a pivotal role in achieving solar energy conversion. In addition, Mo2C also demonstrates strong photo-absorption in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm. Fig. 4B displays the Tauc plots of (αhν)2vs. photon energy (hν) for pristine Mo2C and TiO2, which are derived using the Kubelka–Munk method,36 and the corresponding band gap energies of 3.27 and 1.10 eV, respectively.

The photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay spectra are presented in Fig. 4C and D, which were employed to accurately investigate the migration, transfer, and recombination processes of the photo-generated charge carriers together with the role that Mo2C plays in the photocatalytic process.37–39 Generally, the PL emission peak is an intrinsic characteristic of the radiative recombination of charge carriers for a material. As shown in Fig. 4C, the intensity of the emission peak of the Mo2C/TiO2 composite is much weaker than that of bare TiO2, which indicates that the efficient separation of charge carriers is accelerated and the recombination is retarded at the interface between Mo2C and TiO2,37 thus causing much more free electrons to participate in the photocatalytic reactions. Additionally, the TRPL decay behaviour of the composite was probed since it is a vital factor impacting catalytic performance. Fig. 4D shows the comparison of the TRPL decay spectra of bare TiO2 and the 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2 composite. Notably, the 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2 composite has a longer average decay time of 1.11 ns than that of pure TiO2 (0.72 ns), which suggests that the formed heterojunction interface between Mo2C and TiO2 speeds up the photo-generated charge transfer and effectively depresses charge recombination.38,39 Here, the average decay time is calculated using the following equation:40 (2)where τ1, and τ2 are the decay times for the faster and slower components, respectively, B1 and B2 are the contribution of each component and τav is the average decay time.
3.3. Enhancement of photocatalytic H2 production
To investigate the photocatalytic behavior of the Mo2C/TiO2 hybrids, simulated solar-light-driven H2 production experiments from water in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor were performed, as shown in Fig. 5. Pure TiO2 exhibits a very low H2 production rate (1.6 mmol h−1 g−1) because of its charge-transfer reaction kinetics and extremely slow H2 production rates.41,42 Also, Mo2C shows a very low H2 production rate of ca. 0.32 mmol h−1 g−1. Extraordinarily, the 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2 hybrid photocatalyst exhibits a sharply improved H2 production activity of up to 39.4 mmol h−1 g−1 with its rate ∼25 times higher than that of pristine TiO2. This rate compares favorably to most of the reported rates for TiO2-based promising catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting, as shown in Table S2.† In addition, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) over 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2 at 365 nm was measured and calculated to be 12.1% (Fig. S8†). Apparently, the rates of H2 production for the Mo2C/TiO2 hybrids show a volcano-shaped photoactivity trend with an increase in Mo2C content (Fig. 5A), which implies that loading the appropriate amount of Mo2C on TiO2 is quite significant to optimize the photocatalytic activity of the hybrid photocatalyst. This is because a high Mo2C loading leads to a decrease in the absorption of TiO2. Mo2C is also the recombination center of electron/hole pairs, thus abundant coupling interfaces between Mo2C and TiO2 contribute to the separation and migration of photo-generated charge carriers, resulting in the suppression of electron–holes recombination. Significantly, as shown in Fig. 5B, a highly stable performance is obtained for the Mo2C/TiO2 heterostructure through five consecutive operations of hydrogen production for 20 h. In addition, the results of the XRD and XPS characterization after the reaction (Fig. S9 and S10†) also reflect their superior long-term stability.

(B) Stability examination of H2 production (evacuation every 4 h) for 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2 under simulated solar light irradiation. 
3.4. Photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical properties
In order to investigate the photovoltaic properties of our photocatalysts, lock-in-based surface photovoltage (SPV) spectra and corresponding phase spectra were measured and the results are shown in Fig. 6, which reveal an increase in charge separation in the Mo2C/TiO2 hybrid. In the ultraviolet region (300–400 nm), a weak SPV response signal is observed for pure TiO2 due to its intrinsic transition,43 which indicates that the photo-generated charge carriers can achieve separation in space (Fig. 6A).44,45 It should be noted that the SPV response intensity of the Mo2C/TiO2 hybrid is much stronger than that of pristine TiO2, which signifies that a higher separation efficiency of photo-generated charges is achieved on the Mo2C/TiO2 hybrid.46,47 Therefore, based on the above fact, we speculate that the existence of an interfacial electric field in the Mo2C/TiO2 composite plays a positive role in charge separation. In addition, Fig. 6B shows a comparison of the SPV phase spectra of pure TiO2 and Mo2C/TiO2 in the response range of 300–600 nm. Clearly, compared with pure TiO2, Mo2C/TiO2 achieves more phase retardation with respect to −180°. The above results demonstrate that the trend of photo-generated electrons moving to the outer surface is enhanced,48 which further verifies the critical role of free photo-generated electrons for the surface catalytic reaction.

To explore the interfacial charge transfer, separation and recombination process of the photo-generated charge carriers, amperometric I–t curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots, and normalized open-circuit potential (OCP) decay curves were obtained, as shown in Fig. 7, which compares the photoresponses of bare TiO2 and 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2 electrodes without external bias under simulated solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2) in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. Once the light is turned on, a transient photocurrent is observed due to the separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs. Besides, upon the loading of Mo2C, the photocurrent density of 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2 (∼1.8 μA cm−2) increases distinctly, which is twice the value of pristine TiO2 (∼0.9 μA cm−2). This result implies that the internal electrostatic field formed in the heterostructure contributes to a distinct improvement in the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes.1,37 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots were measured for TiO2 and 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2, which were recorded at an open circuit potential both in the dark and under simulated solar irradiation (Fig. 7B). It is well known that Mo2C has high electrical conductivity,24 thus it can facilitate charge carrier transport on the modified TiO2 electrode. In contrast to pure TiO2, the semicircle diameter of 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2 is much smaller both in the dark and under simulated solar irradiation, which suggests that charge transfer and transport resistance are reduced upon the loading of Mo2C.49,50

(B) EIS Nyquist plots of TiO2 and 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2 at the open circuit potential in the dark and under simulated solar light irradiation. (C) Normalized OCP decay curves of TiO2 and 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2 after turning off the simulated solar light irradiation. (D) Time-dependent I–t curve of 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2 at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl under simulated solar light irradiation. 
The normalized open-circuit potential (OCP) decay curves were further explored to evaluate the surface recombination process on the bare TiO2 and 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2 electrodes,51–53 as shown in Fig. 7C and S11.† The OCP decay curves are defined as the behavior of photo-generated charge carriers after the light was switched off and the average recombination rate can be calculated using the following equation:51,53 (3)where, V, Vlight, and Vdark are the OCP values at any time, under solar light irradiation and in the dark, respectively, and k is the pseudo-first order recombination rate constant. As a result, a much slower OCP decay is achieved on the 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2 electrode than that of the bare TiO2, which suggests that surface recombination is effectively suppressed.51 More importantly, the photoability of the 1 wt% Mo2C/TiO2 electrode can be easily determined from the I–t curve at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, as shown in Fig. 7D. Clearly, the current density remains steady with time during a 5000 s test under simulated solar light irradiation, which can be attributed to the good contact between the dandelion-like TiO2 and Mo2C NPs. This result is well in agreement with the recycle test of the photocatalytic H2 production reaction (Fig. 5B).
3.5. Photocatalytic mechanism
The superior photochemical performance of a photocatalyst can be reasonably attributed to its unique structure and the separation and transfer of photo-generated charge carriers. As shown in Fig. S12,† Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots were obtained to determine the types of conductivity for TiO2 and Mo2C as well as their electronic structures and the results indicate that the positive slopes correspond to n-type conductivity for TiO2 and Mo2C.12 Moreover, it should be noted that the flat band potentials for TiO2 and Mo2C are −0.36 and −0.30 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively (Fig. S12†). Thus, the conduction band (CB) potentials of TiO2 and Mo2C are roughly calculated to be −0.56 and −0.50 V vs. Ag/AgCl,54 which is −0.36 and −0.30 versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) (ENHE = EAg/AgCl + EθAg/AgCl, where EθAg/AgCl = 0.1976 V at 25 °C), respectively. The valence band (VB) potentials of TiO2 and Mo2C are 2.91 and 0.80 V vs. NHE, as calculated by the equation: EVB = ECB + Eg.55 For the convenience of comparison, the calculated ECB and EVB edge positions of TiO2 and Mo2C are summarized in Table S1.†
Based on the above analyses, a postulated photocatalytic mechanism is proposed and depicted in Fig. 8. Clearly, the band edge positions of TiO2 and Mo2C constitute a type I heterojunction,56 the VB of TiO2 is lower than Mo2C, and the CB of TiO2 is higher than the CB of Mo2C, which indicates a structure that is theoretically disadvantageous for charge carrier separation. However, this type of heterojunction is quite common, for example, MoS2/TiO2,57 GaAs/AlGaAs58 and WO3/TiO259 systems. Under solar light irradiation, both TiO2 and Mo2C are activated; the CB-electrons of TiO2 quickly inject into the CB of the Mo2C reduction active sites (solid line arrow, process one, Fig. 8) for participation in the H2 production reaction due to the similar electronic density of state of Mo2C to that of Pt.24 Meanwhile, the VB-holes of TiO2 react with TEOA in the aqueous solution. Certainly, some of the VB-holes of TiO2 can transfer to the VB of Mo2C and combine with electrons to accelerate charge carrier recombination (dashed arrow, process two, Fig. 8). Specifically, charge carrier separation and recombination are two competitive processes. The photocatalytic H2 production as the function of the separation of photo-generated charge carriers of Mo2C/TiO2 matches well with the results of the PL, TRPL, SPV, and OCP decay curves, which indicates that process one is the advantageous process in the competition. Based on these results, the effective electron transfer in Mo2C/TiO2 is clearly demonstrated. This pathway greatly improves the separation rate of electron–hole pairs which results in significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a highly efficient Mo2C/TiO2 heterostructure for photocatalytic H2 production is developed for the first time via a facile fabrication process. The optimized 3D dandelion-like TiO2 with 1 wt% Mo2C exhibits the highest photocatalytic H2 production rate of 39.4 mmol h−1 g−1, which is approximately 25 times that of pristine TiO2. The experimental results, including PL, TRPL, SPV and OCP decay curves, reveal that the coupling of TiO2 with Mo2C accelerates interfacial transfer and the separation of photo-generated charge carriers, thus eventually prolonging the reaction lifetimes of electrons and holes. We believe that this type of noble-metal-free unique hybrid structure possesses great potential in designing promising high-performance photocatalysts.
