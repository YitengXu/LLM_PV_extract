This finding implies that single-crystal CoSe2 nanorods are promising low-cost and high-performance cathode materials for high-performance DSSCs.
Introduction
Since the seminal paper published by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991,1 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted a tremendous amount of interest in scientific research and industrial applications in the past two decades.2 As one of the most promising photovoltaic devices, DSSCs have several advantages over silicon based solar cells such as ease of fabrication and cost-effectiveness. A typical DSSC is constructed with a working electrode (a dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 film), a counter electrode (CE) and a redox-couple based electrolyte sandwiched between the two electrodes. The CE functions as an electrocatalyst to catalyze the reduction of I3− for effective circuit completion. So far, platinum (Pt) has been the most commonly used CE for laboratory research due to its excellent electrocatalytic activity and chemical stability. Unfortunately, the high price and low abundance ratio of Pt create a big obstacle for large-scale applications of DSSCs.3 Therefore development of cheap CE materials with high electrocatalytic activity is of significance for practical applications.
A lot of alternatives to Pt have been developed for use as the CE in DSSCs. The reported CE materials include carbon,4 graphene,5 conductive polymers6 and metal compounds such as oxide,7 sulfide,8 nitride,9 carbide,10 and selenide.11 Among them, metal selenides have drawn great attention due to their distinctive electronic properties, interesting chemical behaviours, and wide variety of potential applications.
Recently, CoSe2 has drawn much attention and several synthetic methods have been reported in the literature.12–14 We report herein single-crystal CoSe2 nanorods for application as the CE in DSSCs. Excitingly, single-crystal CoSe2 nanorods exhibit excellent activity in the reduction of triiodide, and DSSCs with the single-crystal CoSe2 nanorod CE produce a power conversion efficiency of 10.20% versus 8.17% for the Pt CE under the same conditions.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of the CoSe2 powder sample. All the XRD peaks can be well indexed to orthorhombic CoSe2 (JCPDS no. 00-053-0449). No other peaks of impurities are observed, indicating the good purity of the synthesized samples. As compared to the ultrathin-layered CoSe2 nanobelts,12 which exhibited Bragg peaks in the small angle region due to the lamellar structure, the CoSe2 sample prepared in this work did not show XRD peaks below 20° of 2θ. The atomic ratio of Co:Se in the sample determined by EDS is 1.0:2.1, which is close to the stoichiometric ratio of CoSe2. The atomic ratio of Co:Se in the sample determined by ICP-AES is 1.0:2.2, which is also close to the stoichiometric ratio of CoSe2.

Fig. 2 displays the SEM image of the as-prepared sample. CoSe2 nanorods were formed after the hydrothermal reaction, as seen in the SEM images. The nanorods had broad distribution in size: 50–800 nm in length and 20–150 nm in width. The nanorod morphology was further confirmed by the TEM images (Fig. 3a and b). The HRTEM image (Fig. 3c) shows that the lattice spacing was 3.71 ± 0.01 Å, corresponding to the (110) planes of orthorhombic CoSe2 (Fig. 1). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) spots shown in Fig. 3d indicate the single crystalline nature of this nanorod. The electron diffraction pattern of the orthorhombic CoSe2 nanorods is different from that of the layered CoSe2 nanobelt.12

CoSe2 thin films are fabricated by drop-casting the CoSe2 suspension onto FTO substrates. Fig. 4 shows the SEM images of the CoSe2 film. It is evident that the nanorods are deposited on the FTO surface, but the nanorods do not cover the surface completely. For comparison, the SEM image of the Pt deposited FTO is shown in Fig. S1.†

The solar cell performance was optimized through varying the loading amount from 10 to 80 μg cm−2. The efficiency increased by increasing the loading amount up to 20 μg cm−2 and then decreased gradually by further increasing the loading amount. Therefore, the optimal loading was determined to be 20 μg cm−2, which was used for the fabrication of DSSCs and corresponding characterization. Three parallel DSSCs with each CE were constructed and tested under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) with a standard deviation error of 0.3% in absolute efficiency. Fig. 5a displays the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curve for the DSSC with the CoSe2 CE and N719 dye. Impressively, the single-crystal CoSe2 CE produced a PCE of 10.20% with short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) = 18.55 mA cm−2, open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) = 753 mV and fill factor (FF) = 0.73. For comparison, the DSSC with the standard Pt CE was fabricated and measured under the same conditions. According to the J–V curve shown in Fig. 5a, the Pt CE generated Jsc = 15.89 mA cm−2, Voc = 724 mV, and FF = 0.71, corresponding to the PCE of 8.17%. Evidently, replacement of the Pt CE with the single-crystal CoSe2 nanorods CE causes a large increase in PCE by 25%, which is attributed to the significant improvement of Jsc and small increases in Voc and FF.

J–V curves (a) and IPCE spectra (b) of DSSCs with CoSe2 and Pt CE, respectively. 

Fig. 5b displays the IPCE spectra of the two DSSCs. The IPCE value for the CoSe2 cathode is larger than that for the Pt CE at each wavelength in the visible region. This accounts for the larger Jsc of the CoSe2-based DSSC as compared to the Pt-based DSSC.
Although the anode and electrolyte are the same, the Voc is different for the two DSSCs. For the same anode and electrolyte, the different cathode likely causes the difference of Voc, which is determined by the photo-induced current and electron lifetime. To clarify this issue, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed. Fig. 6 shows the EIS Bode plots of the two DSSCs. The left middle-frequency peak is attributed to charge recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. As compared to the Pt-based DSSC, this peak shifts to lower frequency for the CoSe2-based DSSC, indicating a higher electron lifetime. The higher electron lifetime in combination with the higher Jsc for the CoSe2-based DSSC is responsible for the higher Voc as compared with the Pt-based DSSC.

The long-term stability of the DSSCs was evaluated by measuring the photovoltaic performance for eight days. Jsc first decreased and then remained almost unchanged, while Voc, FF and PCE first increased and then remained almost unchanged for the CoSe2-based DSSC (Fig. S2†). By contrast, Jsc first increased and then decreased, Voc first increased followed by a plateau, FF remained stable for one day followed by a decrease, and PCE first increased followed by a slight decrease (5%) for the Pt-based DSSC. It seemed that the CoSe2-based DSSC had better stability than the Pt-based DSSC under daylight storage.
As the DSSCs studied in this work are the same in photoanode and electrolyte but different in CE, the solar cell performance should be related to the catalytic activity of the CE film. To interpret the difference of the solar cell performance, electrocatalytic performances of four parallel electrodes for each sample were evaluated by recording cyclic voltammograms (CV), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), and Tafel polarization curves. The relative standard deviation error was less than 5%. Fig. 7 compares the CV curves of iodide/triiodide redox species on CoSe2 and Pt electrodes, respectively. Two typical pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks (Ox-1/Red-1, Ox-2/Red-2, as labeled in Fig. 7) are well resolved in the range of −0.6 to 0.9 V (vs. Ag/Ag+) for both materials, similar to what has been reported for the DSSC systems in the literature.11,15 According to the literature,16–18 the Red-1 peak is attributed to the reduction of I3− to I− while the Ox-1 peak is attributed to the oxidation of I− to I3−. The Ox-2 peak is attributed to the oxidation of I3− to I2 while the Red-2 peak is attributed to the reduction of I2 to I3−. The characteristics of peaks Ox-1 and Red-1 are at the focus of our analysis because the CE of a DSSC is responsible for catalyzing the reduction of I3− to I−. The peak-to-peak potential separation (Epp) for the pair peaks is inversely correlated with the standard rate constant of a redox reaction. Epp is 0.36 and 0.44 V for CoSe2 and Pt, respectively. This indicates that the reduction rate constant of triiodide to iodide on the single-crystal CoSe2 nanorod is faster than on the Pt electrode. In addition, the CoSe2 nanorod exhibits higher peak currents than the Pt electrode. It is thus concluded that the single-crystal CoSe2 nanorod has higher electrocatalytic performance than Pt on the reduction of triiodide due to the larger reduction rate constant and higher redox peak currents.

To further elucidate the catalytic performance, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed with a symmetric dummy cell, in which a thin layer of redox electrolyte solution used in the DSSC was sandwiched between two identical electrodes (CE/electrolyte/CE). Fig. 8a shows the EIS Nyquist plots where two semicircles were observed. As a small amount of catalyst was deposited on FTO, electrolyte diffusion in catalyst pores was not observed.5 According to the Randles-type circuit (inset of Fig. 8a),19 the high-frequency intercept on the real axis represents the series resistance (Rs). The left arc arises from the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrode/electrolyte interface and the corresponding constant phase angle element (CPE), which describes the deviation from ideal capacitance due to the roughness of the electrode.19 The right semicircle reflects the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the I−/I3− redox couple in the electrolyte. Rct determined by fitting the impedance spectra using the Z-view software is 2.0 and 3.0 Ω for CoSe2 and Pt, respectively. As the apparent surface area is 0.70 and 0.48 cm2 for CoSe2 and Pt, respectively, estimated from the product of the loading amount, geometric area (0.36 cm2) of the CE and BET surface area, the normalized Rct is 1.4 Ω cm2 for both electrodes. Since Rct is correlated inversely with the electrocatalytic performance, CoSe2 and Pt CE films have comparable catalytic activity taking the apparent surface area into account, but the former exhibits higher electrocatalytic performance than the latter due to the larger apparent surface area.

The cell was first subjected to CV scanning from 0 to 1 V, then to −1 V and finally to 0 V with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 followed by 20 s relaxation at 0 V, and then EIS was recorded. This sequential test was repeated for ten cycles. 

Z
N for the CoSe2 CE (3.4 Ω or 2.4 Ω cm2 normalized to the apparent area) is larger than that for the Pt CE (1.2 Ω or 0.6 Ω cm2 normalized to the apparent surface area). ZN describes the impedance of electrolyte diffusion:19 (1)where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of I3− at the electrode, e0 is the elementary charge, c(I3−) is the concentration of I3−, ω is the angular frequency, D(I3−) is the diffusion constant, A is the electrode area, and δ is the diffusion layer thickness (half the distance between electrodes in the dummy cell). As ZN is inversely proportional to the concentration of I3−, the larger ZN for the CoSe2 electrode indicates a lower concentration of I3−. However, the initial concentration of I3− is the same for both dummy cells. It is thus speculated that the concentration of I3− has changed in the dummy cell, which may be influenced by the adsorption of I3− on the electrode. To probe this possible change, we measured the adsorption of I3− on CoSe2 and Pt by means of UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. S3†). It is clearly seen from Fig. S1† that more than 3-fold I3− is adsorbed on CoSe2 as compared to the Pt film. Normalized to the apparent surface area, the I3− ions adsorbed on the CoSe2 CE are about 2-fold that on the Pt CE. This means that CoSe2 has higher adsorption capacity for I3− ions than Pt. Higher adsorption of I3− on the CoSe2 CE signifies the reduction of concentration in the bulk, which reduces the electrolyte conductivity and thus increases ZN. However, the higher adsorption of I3− on the CoSe2 CE is advantageous to fast reduction of I3−, which is at least partly responsible for its lower Rct as compared to the Pt CE.

Fig. 8b shows the evolution of impedance spectra of the dummy cells subjected to sequential scans of CV and EIS for 10 cycles. After 10 cycles of scanning, there was almost no change of Rs and ZN, indicating that the potential cycling hardly influenced the series ohmic resistance and the mass transport in the redox solution. However, Rct increased by 0.05 Ω for CoSe2 and 0.3 Ω for Pt after 10 cycles of scanning. This indicates that CoSe2 had better electrochemical stability than Pt, which is responsible for the better long-term stability of the CoSe2-based DSSC as compared to the Pt-based DSSC.
Furthermore, Tafel polarization was carried out to disclose the information of diffusion-limited current and charge exchange at the CE/electrolyte interface. Fig. 9 shows the Tafel curves of the dummy cells, in which saturation currents (i.e. the limiting current density Jlim) were observed for both CoSe2 and Pt based DSSCs. Owing to the large excess of I− in the electrolyte, only the diffusion of I3− limits the current.19Jlim is proportional to the diffusion constant (D(I3−)) and concentration (c(I3−)) of I3−.19 (2)where F is the Faraday constant and l is the distance between the electrodes in the dummy cell. Jlim for Pt is larger than that for CoSe2. This indicates that the concentration of I3− in the bulk is smaller for the CoSe2 electrode, which is caused by the higher adsorption of I3− on the CoSe2 electrode (Fig. S1†). The result for electrolyte diffusion obtained from the Tafel curve is consistent with that from the EIS analysis.
 Fig. 9  Tafel polarization curves of the dummy cells with CoSe2 and Pt, respectively. 
The charge exchange current density (J0) can be estimated from the slope of the anodic or cathodic branch in the Tafel curve. It can be seen from Fig. 9 that the CoSe2 electrode gives a larger slope than the Pt electrode, indicating that J0 for the former is larger than that for the latter. J0 can also be calculated from Rct obtained from the EIS measurement.19 (3)where R is the gas constant. As Rct (normalized to the geometric area) for the CoSe2 electrode is smaller than that for Pt, J0 for the former derived from eqn (3) is larger than that for the latter, which is in good agreement with the result from Tafel curves.
The above results indicate that single-crystal CoSe2 nanorods supersede Pt in terms of electrocatalytic performance. The higher electrocatalytic performance is responsible for the higher FF and Jsc of single-crystal CoSe2 nanorods, as compared to the Pt CE. To avoid current losses at the CE, J0 should be sufficiently high.20 In principle, high J0 is favourable for high Jsc. The observed higher Jsc of the CoSe2 CE is likely attributed to its higher J0.20
Experimental
Synthesis of CoSe2
The CoSe2 nanorod was synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal reaction.14 Briefly, 0.320 g Se powder (99.999%, Aladding) was dissolved in 30 mL of NaOH (4 g, Sinopharm) aqueous solution to form solution A. Solution B was prepared from 0.587 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O (99.9%, Alfa Aesar) dissolved in 10 mL of 0.25 M EDTA-2Na (>99%, J&K). The two solutions were then added to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave under stirring for several minutes. The autoclave was tightly sealed and heated at 200 °C for 6 h and then cooled down to RT naturally. A large amount of black precipitate was collected, which was washed with dilute acid and distilled water for several cycles followed by drying at 60 °C for 24 h.
Fabrication and evaluation of DSSCs
1.8 mg of CoSe2 nanorods was dispersed in 10 mL of distilled water and ethanol (volume ratio, 1:1) by ultrasonication for 1 h. The CoSe2 suspensions were drop-cast on conductive glass (fluorine-doped SnO2, FTO, 15 Ω square−1, transmittance 85%, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd., Japan), which was masked by 3M Scotch tape with an exposed area of 0.6 × 0.6 cm2. Then the films were dried in an oven at 70 °C. As a reference, the pyrolytic Pt CE was prepared by drop-casting 50 μL of H2PtCl6 in ethanol (5 mM) on FTO glass followed by sintering at 380 °C for 30 min. TiO2 films (18 μm thick) composed of a transparent layer (12 μm, 25 nm TiO2 nanoparticles) in contact with FTO and a scattering layer (6 μm, 25 nm TiO2 nanoparticles (60%) + 300 nm TiO2 nanoparticles (40%)) on top of the transparent layer were prepared by a screen-printing method on FTO glass according to a previous report.21 TiO2 films were soaked overnight in cis-di(isothiocyanato)-bis-(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) bis-tetrabutyl ammonium (so-called N719, used as received from Solaronix SA) solution (0.3 mM in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and tert-butanol in a volume ratio of 1:1). The dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode and the CE were separated by a hot-melt Surlyn film (30 μm thick) and sealed through hot pressing. The electrolyte (0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in absolute acetonitrile) was injected into the interspace between the photoanode and the CE. Finally, the holes on the back of the CE were sealed with a Surlyn film covered with a thin glass slide under heat.
Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) profile was recorded on an X-ray powder diffractometer (D8 Advance, Bruker) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). The morphology and atomic ratio of the selenide sample were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, S-4800, Hitachi) with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The composition of selenide was also detected by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Thermo Electron Corp. Adv. ER/S). The microstructure was characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL). The specific surface area was measured with a Micromeritics ASAP2020 nitrogen adsorption–desorption apparatus. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a three-electrode system containing an anhydrous acetonitrile solution of 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, using a Pt wire as the CE, an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode, and the as-prepared CoSe2 film as the working electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization measurements were performed on the symmetrical dummy cells assembled with two identical electrodes filled with the same electrolyte as used in the DSSC. The active geometric area of the dummy cell was 0.36 cm2 with a distance of 30 μm between the electrodes. In the EIS test, the dummy cell was scanned from 0.1 Hz to 800 kHz at 0 V bias and an ac amplitude of 10 mV. The EIS of DSSCs was carried out on an electrochemical workstation at 0 V bias and an ac amplitude of 10 mV, which includes a white light emitting diode and the corresponding control system. All the electrochemical characterization methods were performed on an electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER ZENNIUM CIMPS-1, Germany). The photocurrent density–voltage curves of DSSCs were recorded on a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of AM1.5G simulated solar light coming from an AAA solar simulator (Newport-94043A) equipped with a Xe lamp (450 W) and an AM1.5G filter. The light intensity was calibrated using a reference Si solar cell (Oriel-91150). A black mask with an aperture area of 0.2304 cm2 was applied on the surface of DSSCs to avoid stray light completely.
Conclusions
In summary, we have applied single-crystal CoSe2 nanorods as the CE in DSSCs. CoSe2 exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity on the reduction of I3−, and the DSSC with the CoSe2 CE produces higher power conversion efficiency (10.20%) than the DSSC with the Pt CE (8.17%). The results presented in this work imply that single-crystal CoSe2 nanorods are promising low-cost and high-performance cathode materials for application in DSSCs.
