    , Accepted 13th February 2019First published on 14th February 2019AbstractMolecular oxygen evolution catalysts, particularly polyoxometalates (POMs), have been rarely reported for improving the performance of semiconductor photoanodes. Herein, a Co-based POM was investigated for modifying Fe2O3 photoanodes. The photogenerated carriers of Fe2O3 have a fundamental effect on Co8POM. Ultrathin CoOx overlayer derived from Co8POM is confirmed as the true active species, which was prepared by a simple photodeposition method. This CoOx nanolayer effectively restrains the surface states on the hematite nanorod and reduces the water oxidation overpotential. Our CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 composite photoanode affords the best PEC performance and the highest photovoltage when compared with pristine Fe2O3 photoanode and CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 photoanode prepared by a simple cobalt salt. The photocurrent density of CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanode is 2.2 times higher than that of pristine Fe2O3 photoanodes. Meanwhile, the CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 composite photoanode achieves faster transient photoresponse and an improved charge injection efficiency of 80%.
1. Introduction
Splitting water into H2 and O2 by utilizing solar energy has been recognized as a feasible way to replace fossil fuels (oil, gas, and coal) in the near future. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been widely investigated since it is one of the most promising ways to realize water splitting depending on semiconductors as light-harvesting materials.1–3 Further, PEC devices have an advantage of having spatially separated photoanode and photocathode. It is very convenient to investigate the half-cell reaction at the photoanode or photocathode.4 Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at the photoanode comprises the transfer of four electrons and four protons.5,6 This process is typically considered to present a kinetic bottleneck toward overall water splitting. Till date, inorganic semiconductor materials such as α-Fe2O3,7–10 BiVO4,11–13 and WO314–17 for manufacturing photoanodes have been extensively investigated in terms of their low cost, easy fabrication, and stability in aqueous solutions.
For achieving high solar-energy conversion efficiency, it is desirable for the semiconductors fabricated for PEC photoanodes to have suitable bandgap structures, satisfactory charge-carrier conductivity, and fast surface reaction kinetics.18,19 As a promising material for water splitting, hematite (α-Fe2O3) has been substantially investigated as a photoanode for PEC water oxidation because of its ample abundance, nontoxicity, favorable optical bandgap (1.9–2.2 eV), and high photochemical stability in aqueous environments.20,21 Nevertheless, hematite suffers from severe surface states and low charge separation efficiency, which stem from its small hole diffusion length (2–4 nm) and short excited-state lifetime (3–10 ps).21,22 Usually, modifying hematite by oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs) is beneficial toward improving the surface reaction kinetics and/or extracting holes from its valence band (VB).23 Several heterogeneous OECs have been applied to fabricate composite photoanodes with hematite, such as Co3O4,24 FeOOH,25 and NiFe-LDH.7 Meanwhile, a recent publication reported CoWO4 cocatalysts that were synthesized via the annealing of [Co4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2]10−.26 The annealing of soluble homogeneous molecules at high temperatures leads to the formation of insoluble heterogeneous OECs. However, few publications based on photoelectrocatalysis have investigated homogeneous OECs in order to improve the performance of hematite photoanodes. The major challenge in this field may be the obscure stability of molecular OECs when they combine with semiconductor photoanodes.27
Polyoxometalates (POMs) have been widely studied as a type of OECs both in photocatalytic28,29 and electrocatalytic30,31 systems due to their unique structural features, tunable bandgap structures, and high stability. POMs have exhibited efficient water oxidation performance and good stability using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as a photosensitizer in photocatalytic systems. However, molecular all-inorganic POMs with excellent photoactivity have seldom been reported as a cocatalyst in PEC systems. An octanuclear cobalt-containing POM ([(A-α-SiW9O34)2Co8(OH)6(H2O)2(CO3)3]16−) with bioinspired cubical core exhibits excellent water oxidation activity and high hydrolytic stability in a photocatalytic system,32 which could be a potential PEC cocatalyst candidate.
Herein, we construct a PEC water oxidation system using molecular Co8POM as the cocatalyst candidate and Fe2O3 as the photoanode material. During the PEC research process, we found that an ultrathin CoOx nanolayer derived from Co8POM is a true cocatalytic species. A photodeposition method is adopted for constructing an effective composite photoanode. The resulting composite photoanode labeled as CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 exhibits a considerably improved PEC performance. After coating the CoOx nanolayer, the photocurrent density at 1.23 VRHE is over 2-fold higher than that of pristine hematite photoanodes. The surface states of hematite are obviously passivated with CoOx overlayer loading. Therefore, the conformally ultrathin overlayer can effectively improve the surface reaction kinetics. At the same time, photogenerated carriers are efficiently separated, achieving faster transient photoresponse and improved charge injection efficiency by 80%. The highest photovoltage (Vph) of CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 is observed by open-circuit potential measurements, which contributes toward the best PEC performance of composite photoanodes. An ultrathin CoOx overlayer derived from Co8POM was firstly investigated in PEC systems. Our study is also helpful in understanding whether or not the photogenerated carriers affect the integrity and stability of the molecular catalysts based on POMs.
2. Experiment section
2.1 Materials
All the chemicals were of the analytical grade and were used as purchased without any further purification. Purified water (18.25 MΩ cm) for the experiments was obtained from a Molecular Lab Water Purifier. Before the experiment, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, Zhuhai Kaivo Optoelectronic Technology Co., Ltd., <15 Ω sq−1) conductive glass was ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, ethanol, and purified water for 30 min each in sequence prior to use.
2.2 Fabrication of α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays on FTO
α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays were grown on FTO through two steps previously reported.7 Firstly, FeOOH nanorod arrays were grown on FTO by a hydrothermal method. Typically, 1.5 mmol FeCl3·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1.5 mmol urea (Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute) were dissolved in 10 mL water. Then, the solution was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave in which FTO substrates were placed with the conductive side facing the wall of the autoclave. After 10 h of reaction at 100 °C, uniform FeOOH nanorod arrays were formed on the FTO substrates. The FeOOH nanorod arrays were thoroughly rinsed with purified water and dried at room temperature. Finally, the substrates were annealed at 550 °C for 2 h and 700 °C for 15 min to convert FeOOH into α-Fe2O3.
2.3 Synthesis of Co8POM
[(A-α-SiW9O34)2Co8(OH)6(H2O)2(CO3)3]16− (Co8POM) was synthesized according to the methods described in earlier reports.32,33 First, lacunary precursors Na10[A-α-SiW9O34]·19H2O were synthesized as described earlier.34 After that, 1 g (0.35 mmol) of Na10[A-α-SiW9O34]·19H2O and 0.40 g (1.42 mmol) of CoSO4·7H2O were dissolved in sodium acetate solution (0.5 M, 20 mL, pH 8). The resulting solution was stirred for 30 min until a clear solution was obtained. Then, 0.714 mL potassium carbonate solution (2 M) was slowly added, and the resulting solution was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The pH of the solution was maintained between 8.9 and 9.3. Then, this solution was centrifuged to remove the insoluble solids. Well-formed purple plate-like crystals were formed in a few days after evaporation at room temperature and washed with some cold water. Co8POM was confirmed via IR (Fig. S1b†) and UV-vis (Fig. S2†) spectroscopies, which reproduced the literature values.
2.4 Preparation of CoOx/Fe2O3 photoanodes
CoOx nanolayers were photodeposited in situ on hematite nanorod arrays by a simple illumination treatment using Co8POM solution. In other words, the Fe2O3 electrode was immersed in Co8POM solution (2 μM in an 80 mM borate buffer solution, pH 9) under irradiation for 20 min (100 mW cm−2, Xe lamp). In order to match with the atomic number of Co ions in Co8POM molecule (eight cobalt atoms in the molecular formula of Co8POM), a concentration of 16 μM Co2+ solution (Co(NO3)2·6H2O) was used in place of the Co8POM solution (this Co2+ solution was stirred for over 10 min before use). Then, the composite electrodes were softly rinsed by purified water for over three times.
For comparison, Na10[A-α-SiW9O34]·19H2O, the chemical used for preparing Co8POM, was used to process Fe2O3 photoanodes as described above. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results of the Fe2O3 photoanode were recorded before and after 20 min of photodeposition with Na10[A-α-SiW9O34]·19H2O (4 μM).
2.5 Characterizations
The surface morphologies of the as-prepared electrodes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6701F, JEOL) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 TF20). The crystalline structure of the samples was identified by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, X'Pert PRO) using Cu Kα radiation as the X-ray source. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were measured by ESCALAB250xi with X-ray monochromatization. The binding energy was calibrated with respect to the C 1s level of 284.8 eV of contaminated carbon. The UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained by using a TU-1810 spectrophotometer (Beijing Purkinje General Instrument Co.) with a photomultiplier tube detector. Infrared spectra (2–4 wt% sample in KBr pellets) were obtained using a Nicolet iS5 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a UV-2550 (Shimadzu) spectrometer by using BaSO4 as the reference.
2.6 PEC measurements
The PEC performance of the photoanodes was obtained on a CHI 760D workstation (CH Instruments Co.) with a three-electrode setup under simulated solar-light irradiation (air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) filter, 100 mW cm−2, Perfect Light). The fabricated electrode, Pt plate, and Ag/AgCl electrode (3.5 M KCl) were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. In particular, an 80 mM borate buffer solution (pH 9) was used as the electrolyte and bubbled with Ar gas for 30 min for all the PEC tests. All the measured potentials were converted to V vs. RHE (ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.208 + 0.059 × pH). Mott–Schottky analysis was carried out in the DC potential range of 0.2–1.4 V vs. RHE with an AC potential frequency of 1 kHz under dark conditions. For the open circuit potential (OCP) measurements, each dark/light OCP value was obtained after a stabilization process of 30 min.
The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was measured at 1.23 VRHE in the borate electrolyte using the same three-electrode setup described above. A SCS10-PEC system including Omni-λ300 monochromator (Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd.) was used to collect the IPCE data. IPCE can be expressed by the following equation:  where I (mA cm−2) is the measured photocurrent density at a specific wavelength, λ (nm) is the wavelength of incident light, and Plight (mW cm−2) is the measured light power density at a specific wavelength.
Applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) was calculated from the photocurrent–potential (J–V) plots by using the following equation:  where I (mA cm−2) is the measured photocurrent density from the J–V plots, Vbias (V vs. RHE) is the applied potential, and Plight is the incident illumination power density (100 mW cm−2).
The charge injection efficiency (ηinjection) related to the surface conditions of hematite-based photoanodes was obtained for evaluating the photogenerated holes that reach the electrode/electrolyte interface. With hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a hole scavenger, ηinjection could thus be determined as Jwater/Jhydrogen peroxide on the basis of the typical J–V curve under AM 1.5G illumination at 80 mM borate buffer solution with/without 0.5 M H2O2 electrolyte. ηinjection was calculated using the following equation:35,36  
The electrochemical active surface area (EASA) was determined by measuring the capacitive current associated with the double-layer charging from the scan-rate dependence of cyclic voltammograms (CVs). CVs were performed in 80 mM borate buffer at the scan rates of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, and 200 mV s−1 without illumination. Further, the potential window of CVs was 0.4–0.5 V vs. RHE. The double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was estimated by plotting ΔJ = (Ja − Jc) at 0.45 V vs. RHE against the scan rate. The linear slope is equivalent to twice that of Cdl, which can be used to represent the EASA.37
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Effect of photogenerated carriers
In the beginning, we added Co8POM into the electrolyte for PEC tests with hematite as the photoanode. The chronoamperometry was used to evaluate the photocurrent and stability of the PEC system (Fig. 1a). The photocurrent density gradually increases in the first several minutes. Then, it achieves a constant value that is nearly twice as high as the photocurrent density of bare Fe2O3 photoanodes. After the PEC tests, this piece of photoanode was removed and put into the new electrolyte without Co8POM. J–V measurements (Fig. 1b) before and after changing the electrolyte show an almost unchanged photocurrent curve. As a homogeneous molecular water oxidation catalyst,32 Co8POM exhibits high hydrolytic stability. Time-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra with pure Co8POM were conducted for proving the hydrolytic stability (Fig. S2†). The curves almost entirely overlap during aging for 3 h, indicating that the Co(II) leaching behavior is negligible for Co8POM solution in our work. Under the condition of introducing hematite to harvest light, the J–V results indicate that Co8POM plays an important role in improving the performance of the Fe2O3 photoanode. However, it is obvious that Co8POM functions as a kind of active species on the photoanode rather than in the electrolyte. Two main hypotheses considered here for the active species are as follows: (1) the starting Co8POM is adsorbed/immobilized on the hematite photoanode as an active OEC; (2) the starting Co8POM is converted into an active species covering the photoanode, such as CoOx.
 Fig. 1  (a) Current–time curves of pristine Fe2O3 and Fe2O3 with Co8POM solution (2 μM). (b) Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results of the photoanode measured 20 min before and after the chronoamperometric measurement and remeasured in a new blank electrolyte without Co8POM. 
Considering the true active species under photochemical environments, it is crucial to understand whether or not the photogenerated carriers impact the POMs. Herein, we carried out two kinds of methods to obtain the cocatalyst/Fe2O3 photoanode composite using Co8POM. The first preparation method was that Fe2O3 was soaked in a Co8POM solution (35 μM) in the dark for 20 min and then the as-synthesized photoanode was used for the PEC performance measurement (labeled as Fe2O3-a). The second preparation method was that Fe2O3 was illuminated in the Co8POM solution (35 μM) for 20 min, and a thick layer of CoOx film (see the later characterization) was deposited on the bare Fe2O3 photoanode (labeled as Fe2O3-b). J–V plots distinctly show the different performances of the composite electrode samples between the treatment with Co8POM in the absence and presence of illumination (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  LSVs of pristine Fe2O3 and Fe2O3-based photoanodes prepared by two methods, namely, soaking in Co8POM solution (35 μM) in dark for 20 min (Fe2O3-a), and photodeposition in Co8POM (35 μM) solution with illumination for 20 min (Fe2O3-b). A concentration of 35 μM is the optimized result for clarifying the issue. 
The photocurrent density increases for the sample (Fe2O3-a) after soaking Co8POM without illumination when compared with that of pristine Fe2O3 photoanode, whose J–V plot is similar to the Fe2O3 sample with the Co8POM solution (red curve in Fig. 1b). However, the photocurrent density decreases for the sample (Fe2O3-b) treated with Co8POM with illumination when compared with that of pristine Fe2O3 photoanode. The poor performance of the Fe2O3-b sample could be attributed to the accumulation of CoOx on pristine Fe2O3, which is likely to block the light-harvesting ability and aggravate the recombination of electrons and holes. For the Fe2O3-a sample, only a small amount of CoOx derived from the decomposition of Co8POM adsorbed onto Fe2O3 was deposited on the surface of the Fe2O3 photoanode and the thin layer CoOx could be act as an efficient cocatalyst to promote the water oxidation reaction. For the Fe2O3-b sample, a large amount of CoOx was formed on the surface of the Fe2O3 photoanode during the illumination treatment in the presence of Co8POM. Only a suitable amount of CoOx loaded onto Fe2O3 can efficiently extract holes from Fe2O3 and boost the surface reaction kinetics. These results confirm that the photogenerated carriers indeed affect the stability of Co8POM. The original cocatalyst of Co8POM is converted into a more stable active species covering the photoanode and it is the true cocatalyst for the water oxidation reaction.
3.2 Analysis and activity of CoOx
The morphologies of pristine Fe2O3 and CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanodes were investigated by SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 3a, it can be observed that the diameter of Fe2O3 nanorods is around 90 nm. From the top view of pristine Fe2O3, evidently, the head of the nanorod has regular morphology with crystal facets. Although the nanorod structure and its diameter remain nearly unchanged after the photodeposition treatment, the head of the nanorod tends to be circular (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, an ultrathin nanolayer with a thickness less than 5 nm can be observed on the surface of the Fe2O3 nanorod (Fig. 1c), indicating the decomposition of Co8POM by the photogenerated carriers from hematite. This Co-based overlayer detected by HRTEM contains Co(OH)2 and CoOOH, which is denoted as CoOx. The elemental mapping images (Fig. 1d) show that the Fe element is mainly distributed in the core area throughout the nanorod, while the Co element is confirmed as the uniform dispersion in the form of CoOx nanolayer on the surface of Fe2O3 nanorods. Meanwhile, only Fe, Co, and O elements are detected by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Fig. S3†). The XRD results are shown in Fig. S4.† There are no distinct peaks of CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 belonging to cobalt oxide, hydroxide, or oxyhydroxide. It is reasonable that the cocatalysts with a layer thickness of a few nanometers can hardly be detected by XRD.38 It is a challenging task to determine the chemical composition of the Co-based cocatalyst owing to the limited amount of Co species on the surface of the hematite photoanode.

J–V plots for PEC water oxidation activity were examined in an 80 mM borate buffer solution (pH 9) under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 with different Co8POM concentrations and illumination times for photodeposition (Fig. S5†). An optimized condition of preparing the composite photoanode is 2 μM of Co8POM solution and 20 min of illumination time. Over the entire potential range (Fig. 4a), CoOx nanolayers derived from Co8POM significantly increase the photocurrent of pristine Fe2O3. At 1.23 VRHE, the CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanode has a photocurrent density of 1.1 mA cm−2, which is over two times higher than that of the pristine Fe2O3 photoanode (only 0.5 mA cm−2). This is among the highest enhancement of photocurrents by loading analogous Co-based cocatalysts on hematite photoanodes (Table S1†). At the same time, an evidently negative shift of the onset potential is observed. In our experimental conditions, with a simple cobalt salt as the cobalt source instead of Co8POM, the photocurrent density of CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 photoanode merely reaches 0.7 mA cm−2 in addition to the moderately negative shift in the onset potential when compared with that of pristine Fe2O3 photoanodes.
 Fig. 4  (a) LSV and (b) chopped-light LSV of CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3, CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3, and Fe2O3 photoanodes under AM 1.5G irradiation in 80 mM borate buffer (pH 9). (c) Chronoamperometric measurement for 3 h at 1.23 VRHE. (d) IPCE spectra measured at an applied bias of 1.23 VRHE. 
Chopped-light LSV measurements were used to examine the transient current response of the three photoanodes (Fig. 4b). The upward spikes of the current transients (light on) represent the accumulation of holes at the electrode/electrolyte interface without any injections to the electrolyte. Further, the downward spikes of the current transients (light off) indicate the recombination of electrons from the conduction band with the accumulated holes.35 It is observed that CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 exhibits the best transient current response among the three electrodes, indicating the well-separated carriers at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Hematite suffers from severe interface recombination of photogenerated carriers owing to the existence of surface states (these surface states are considered as trapped centers of holes).21,39 The existence of surface states can yield inferior transient current response of hematite. In general, the severe interface recombination can be alleviated by employing cocatalysts or non-catalytic passivation layers.39,40 Herein, despite the fact that CoOx cocatalysts derived from both Co8POM and simple cobalt salt have the ability to increase the photocurrent of hematite, CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 is not as effective as CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 in reducing the surface states and improving the sluggish hole transfer (injection) from the electrode to the electrolyte. The deficient performance of CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 in the transient current response may be attributed to the fact that the composition of Co-based species of CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 differs from that in the CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanode. Further, the composition of Co-based species, particularly for CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 photoanode, will be discussed later. For comparison, 1 M NaOH solution (pH 13.6), the most commonly used electrolyte for hematite photoanodes, was also applied as the electrolyte for the CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 electrode. A photocurrent value of 2.4 mA cm−2 was achieved at 1.23 VRHE, which is twice as high as that of the pristine hematite photoanode (Fig. S6 and Table S1†).
The constant potential electrolysis was performed at 1.23 VRHE with AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) for 3 h. Fig. 4c shows that the CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 electrode exhibits the best performance. The photocurrent density of CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 after electrolysis for 3 h is only 73% of the initial value. The phenomena of photocurrent decay in cobalt-based cocatalysts were commonly reported by previous publications.24,41–43 In spite of this, the photocurrent can be maintained at 94% in the case of the CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 electrode. The small decay during the electrolysis period of 3 h can be attributed to several factors, including the redox nature of cobalt oxide species and the turbulence of bubbles.
The IPCE of the electrode was measured at 1.23 VRHE. As shown in Fig. 4d, photodepositing a CoOx nanolayer derived from Co8POM significantly enhances the IPCE values over the entire wavelength range, and the best IPCE value for CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 electrode reaches up to 17% at 400 nm. Moreover, the ABPE was plotted as a function of the applied potential. The CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanode achieves the maximum ABPE value of 0.10% at 1.04 V, which is considerably higher than that of 0.06% at 1.05 V for CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 electrode (Fig. S8†). The produced oxygen is monitored by a sensitive Clark electrode. The faradaic efficiency of CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanode is calculated to be 81.9% (Fig. S9†).
The EASA values of the electrodes were compared using their Cdl values. Because of the similar nanolayer structures of the composite photoanodes, Cdl can reasonably represent their active surface areas.37 The Cdl values of both CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 and CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 are ca. 1.4 times as high as that of pristine Fe2O3 (Fig. 5 and Table S5†). This indicates that, initially, the two composite electrodes have similar EASA values. Interestingly, the Cdl value of CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 drops after PEC tests, while CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 electrode demonstrates an insignificant change after the same PEC tests. The degradation of the EASA values for CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 can be related to the change in the nanostructure of CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 before and after the PEC tests (Fig. S10†). Although the electrochemical surface areas of the electrodes are not the only factors affecting the PEC performance, their differences before and after the PEC tests can be a logical explanation of the better stability of the CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanode.
 Fig. 5  Charging current density differences (ΔJ = (Ja − Jc)) plotted against the scan rates. The linear slope is equivalent to twice the Cdl value. Pristine Fe2O3 and CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanodes (a) before and (c) after the PEC tests. CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 photoanode (b) before and (d) after the PEC tests. 
In addition, XPS as a surface-sensitive technique was applied to identify the Co oxidation states of the CoOx nanolayers. Fig. 6a shows the detailed spectra over the Co 2p region, revealing the spin–orbit splitting into Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 components. The broad satellite peaks centered at 786.3 eV indicate the fact that CoOx contains Co2+ species.44–46 Furthermore, the main peak of Co 2p3/2 could be fitted into the two peaks at 780.4 eV and 781.7 eV, which represent Co3+ and Co2+ species, respectively.37,47 This illustrates that CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 or CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 contains both Co3+ and Co2+ species. Moreover, from the B 1s spectra, it was found that CoBi species exist on the CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 photoanode but not on the CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanode (Fig. 6b and S11†). The binding energy of the B 1s peak appears at 190.4 eV, corresponding to the core levels of the central boron atoms in the borate structure.48–50 As reported by previous publications,51,52 CoBi is an active water oxidation electrocatalyst with an amorphous film structure. Meanwhile, the different compositions between CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 and CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 are also corroborated by the O 1s high-resolution spectra (Fig. S12†).
 Fig. 6  (a) Co 2p spectra of CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 and CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 photoanodes, and (b) B 1s spectra of CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3, CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3, and Fe2O3 photoanodes. 
The elemental compositions of CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3, CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3, and Fe2O3 were determined by XPS (Table S2†) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Tables S3 and S4†). The XPS and ICP-AES results reveal the presence of a marginal amount of W on the photoanode. The W/Co ratios in CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 are 0.12 and 0.18, respectively, as obtained from the XPS and ICP analyses. However, the calculated W/Co ratio in Co8POM is 2.25. The existence of this marginal amount of elemental W may be a result of adsorption (Fig. S13†). Moreover, we conducted experiments to clarify if the ligands decompose, thereby affecting the catalytic activity. This shows that both W and Si within the ligand of Na10[A-α-SiW9O34]·19H2O do not influence the catalytic activity (Fig. 7). Therefore, in our work, the initial Co8POM is indeed converted into CoOx covering the photoanode, which was the hypothesis in the beginning of the “Results and discussion” section. The improved catalytic activity of CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanode results from the existence of the CoOx cocatalyst.

3.3 Investigation mechanism
In order to investigate the working mechanism of the CoOx nanolayers, Mott–Schottky measurements were carried out under dark conditions (Fig. 8a). The plot of Fe2O3 shows a positive slope, indicating that pristine Fe2O3 is an n-type semiconductor. The flat-band potential (VFB) derived from the Mott–Schottky plot represents the circumstance where the Fermi level of the semiconductor is equal to the electron level of the redox couple in the electrolyte. Under this equilibrium state, no photocurrent is generated under irradiation. After cocatalyst nanolayers are coated onto hematite photoanodes, the VFB values of the samples are shifted by −150 mV and −90 mV for CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 and CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3, respectively. At the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes can be attributed to the band bending of the depletion layer.53,54 The width of the depletion layer (WSC) has a relationship with the reverse bias: WSC typically scales with (V − VFB)1/2.55 Therefore, the photoresponse is obtained in the form of ascending photocurrent as the reverse bias increases. In this sense, the smallest VFB value of CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 corresponds to the most negative onset potential of CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 (Fig. 4a). This demonstrates that the CoOx cocatalyst on the CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanode can efficiently reduce the kinetic overpotential for water oxidation.

In addition, the carrier density (ND) could be estimated from the slope of the Mott–Schottky plot56 by using the following equation:ND = (2/eεε0)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1where ND is the carrier density, e is the electron charge, ε is the dielectric constant of hematite (ε = 80),57ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, C is the space charge capacitance, and V is the potential applied on the photoanode. The carrier densities for CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3, CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3, and Fe2O3 were calculated to be 2.8 × 1019, 1.3 × 1019, and 1.1 × 1019, respectively (Table 1). The CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 electrode yields the largest ND value, which is over two times that of pristine Fe2O3. Nevertheless, the CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 and Fe2O3 electrodes have similar ND values, indicating that the cocatalyst on the CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 electrode has a negligible influence on the interfacial states. These results reveal the distinct hole-extraction capability of the CoOx overlayer in CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanodes. The ultrathin CoOx overlayer on CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 is simultaneously able to passivate the surface states and reduce the water oxidation overpotential. The measurements of ηinjection also corroborate our abovementioned conclusion. ηinjection represents the yield of holes that are injected into the electrolyte. A prominent surface hole injection efficiency of 80% is obtained for CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 when compared with those of CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 (56%) and pristine Fe2O3 (39%) electrodes at 1.5 VRHE (Fig. S14†). In addition, with the p-type feature of CoOx,58 it is possible that the CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanode forms p–n junctions between the nanorods and their ultrathin overlayers during the PEC tests. Therefore, the photogenerated holes can transfer to the surface of the photoanode rather than recombine with electrons.

Co-based cocatalysts are usually beneficial to accelerate the surface reaction kinetics for water oxidation.38,43,47 As reported by Barroso et al.,59 the positive effect of Co-based cocatalysts on the semiconductors has been related to its redox-active nature, and therefore, its ability to relay holes. The CoBi species discovered in the CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 electrode has been previously investigated to decorate photoanodes by electrodeposition and photoelectrodeposition.41,52 In those publications, the improved performance of the composite photoanodes was attributed to the reduction of water oxidation overpotential or enhanced OER kinetics in the presence of CoBi cocatalysts. Herein, we find that the performance of the CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 electrode is not as noticeable as that of the CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 electrode in both kinetic and thermodynamic aspects.
Furthermore, the evidence of significant roles performed by the CoOx nanolayer derived from Co8POM is obtained from the OCP measurements (Fig. 8b). OCP tests were implemented under both dark and light conditions with a zero net exchange current across the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. Therefore, we can collect the thermodynamic information with a minimum influence of the kinetic factors.60 In the dark, the ideal OCP value of hematite lies at 1.23 VRHE as the water oxidation potential. However, the OCP measurements of pristine Fe2O3 electrodes were performed at only 0.82 VRHE. The potential drop (ηH) of 410 mV occurs within the Helmholtz layer and impairs the photovoltage-generation capabilities of hematite. After photodeposition treatments, the dark OCP values are 1.04 VRHE for CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 and 0.95 VRHE for CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3, respectively. These results indicate that Co-based cocatalysts can reduce the ηH values of hematite photoanodes. Under illumination, OCP reflects the quasi-Fermi level of holes, representing the equilibrium between the photoanode and electrolyte. The quasi-equilibrium potentials of the three samples are comparable because they are determined by the nature of hematite. The slightly negative shift in the light OCP value of CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 could be the reason that the formation of p–n junction acts as a dual-absorber system.60 Then, the corresponding Vph values are calculated to be 0.40, 0.22, and 0.13 V for CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3, CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3, and Fe2O3, respectively. The highest Vph value of the CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanode contributes to the highest photocurrent density and the most negative shift in the onset potential (Fig. 4a). Based on the abovementioned discussion, the band diagrams of the three photoanodes under open-circuit conditions are shown in Scheme 1. From the thermodynamic aspect, it is observed that the CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanode has the best performance than those of CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 and Fe2O3 photoanodes.

For pristine hematite under open-circuit conditions, a significant potential drop (ηH) occurs across the Helmholtz layer. Surface modification by CoOx helps reduce the ηH value and increase the Vph value. Furthermore, the CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanode achieves the smallest ηH value as well as the largest Vph value, which significantly enhances the OER kinetics. 
4. Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated that photogenerated carriers have a fundamental influence on Co8POM in PEC systems. Ultrathin CoOx nanolayers derived from Co8POM, the true active catalyst, are conformally photodeposited onto the surface of Fe2O3 nanorods. The well-dispersed ultrathin CoOx nanolayer effectively passivates the surface states of hematite and reduces the kinetic overpotential for water oxidation. Meanwhile, when compared with CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 and pristine Fe2O3 photoanodes, the CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanode has the highest Vph as well as the smallest ηH values. Hence, the CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanode yields the best PEC performance. Overall, it is important for researchers to investigate whether or not photogenerated carriers can affect the integrity and stability of molecular catalysts when combined with semiconductors. At the same time, ultrathin CoOx cocatalysts derived from Co8POM have been firstly investigated as the true active species, which were prepared by a simple photodeposition method. These results are promising for the field of solar water splitting in hybrid PEC cells.
