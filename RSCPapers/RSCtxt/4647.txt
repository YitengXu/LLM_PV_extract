    , Accepted 14th June 2022First published on 15th June 2022AbstractSolar-driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution promises a bright future in responding to energy issues and environmental emergencies. Herein, we report a reduced graphene oxide decorated CdS (rGO-CdS) photocatalyst with a hollow nanobox morphology and an electronic structure via a facile and effective electrostatic self-assembly strategy for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

1. Introduction
The ever-growing energy crisis coupled with environmental pollution calls for the exploration of new, green, clean, and sustainable technologies.1–3 Among them, semiconductor photocatalytic technology for water splitting, converting inexhaustible solar energy to hydrogen chemical energy, serves as an effective and environmentally-friendly approach.4–8 The key targets in this field are highly dependent on the delicate design of highly efficient photocatalysts, marking good activity and stability, for solar-driven H2 production.9–11 An ideal visible-light-responsive photocatalytic material of cadmium sulfide (CdS), possesses the merits of a suitable band gap and conduction band alignment, affording sufficient photo-carries with high carrier mobilities, for facilitating surface proton reduction in photocatalytic H2 production. Unfortunately, CdS itself still suffers from high recombination of charge carriers, inadequate surface-active sites, and severe photo-corrosion.11–16 Such unfavorable factors restrain its practical photocatalytic performance in commercial applications.
To date, to achieve noticeable photocatalytic H2 production, a variety of strategies have been proposed to enhance the photocatalytic performance of CdS catalysts, including morphology control,17–20 heteroatom doping,21 heterojunction construction,22–24 and cocatalyst loading.25–27 As a novel and feasible concept, morphology control is a well-known solution to improve the photocatalytic performance of CdS, in terms of high separation of electron–hole pairs, rapid charge transport rates, and abundant active sites. In this regard, hollow CdS nanoboxes are extremely desirable, because of their unique features of high reduction potential for photocatalytic redox capacity in H2 evolution with strong visible-light harvesting ability, short charge migration distance, and abundant shell reactive sites.28–33
Now, one question of photo-corrosion instability remains unanswered. In view of this, we can finely tackle the issues of photo-corrosion instability via the selection and combination of multi-functional materials. Recently, the ideal sp2 carbon-based 2D graphene, consisting of a planar honeycomb lattice of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, has been developed as a new-type of coating material in functional composites, owing to its strong mechanic stability, together with other physical and chemical features of high electrical conductivity, high electron mobility, and wide light absorption.34–39 Therefore, the introduction of graphene with unique features as a promising co-catalyst endows the CdS composite photocatalyst with high photo-corrosion stability toward the H2 evolution reaction. Given this, it is highly desirable to combine graphene with hollow structured CdS as a highly active catalyst in H2 evolution photocatalysis.40–42
Herein, rGO modified hollow cubic CdS (rGO-CdS) nanobox photocatalysts were elaborately designed and prepared via a facile electrostatic self-assembly strategy. Benefiting from hollow structural features, visible-light harvesting ability, short carrier transport distance, efficient separation of photoexcited carriers, and rich surface reactive sites, the optimal rGO-CdS-3 exhibited the largest hydrogen production rate of 75.1 μmol h−1, which is 5 times higher than that of pristine CdS. Meanwhile, the establishment of the built-in interface electric field and Coulomb interaction in the rGO-CdS-3 photocatalyst significantly facilitate the space charge separation and accelerate the interfacial charge migration and transfer, which is beneficial to the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The experimental results coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm the interfacial charge migration route from CdS to rGO. This work opens valuable avenues for fabricating CdS-based nanocomposites for solar-to-chemical energy conversion.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of rGO-CdS nanocomposites
First, graphene oxide (GO) was prepared from natural crystalline graphite powder by a modified Hummers' method.43 In a typical synthesis, 0.1 g of the as-prepared APS-CdS nanoboxes (ESI†) was dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water. Then, the negatively charged GO was added to the solution with the weight ratio of GO to APS-CdS (ESI†) of 0.02:1, 0.03:1, 0.04:1 under continuous stirring at 80 °C for 6 h. Next, 5 mL of hydrazine hydrate was added to the above solution and refluxed for 12 h. Finally, the rGO-CdS-X (X = 2, 3, and 4) precipitate was collected by filtration, washed three times with ethanol, and then dried at 60 °C.
2.2. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα, λ = 0.15418 nm). The micromorphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi FESEM-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100). The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Vertex 70 spectrometer. Raman spectra were recorded on a microscopic confocal Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, LabRAMHR) using a 532 nm excitation laser. Zeta potential measurements were performed by the electrophoresis method using a Delsa Nano C (Malvern Instruments). N2 sorption isotherms were acquired at 77 K on a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ analyzer. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) measurements were carried out on a spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu), using BaSO4 as the reference. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were collected on a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer.
2.3. Photoelectrochemical measurements
Transient photocurrent and Mott–Schottky experiments were conducted on a standard three-electrode cell with a Pt plate and Ag/AgCl electrode as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. Na2SO4 aqueous solution (1 M) was used as the electrolyte. The working electrode was prepared by coating the mixed suspension (0.5 mL of ethanol containing 10 μL of 5% Nafion solution) on a 2.5 cm × 1.0 cm FTO glass, before drying at 80 °C for 10 h. For electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurement, the working electrode was made as follows: 8.0 mg of the photocatalyst was mixed with 1.0 mg of carbon black and 0.1 mg of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in 0.5 mL of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to form a homogeneous slurry. Then, the slurry was coated onto a nickel screen sheet with an active area of 2.0 cm × 1.0 cm and kept at 60 °C for 12 h.
2.4. Photocatalytic H2 evolution
The photocatalytic H2 evolution activities of all photocatalysts were evaluated on a 250 mL top-irradiation quartz reactor under visible light irradiation at room temperature with circulating cooling water. 50 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in 100 mL of a mixed aqueous solution containing 20 mL of lactic acid, serving as the sacrificial agent, with magnetic stirring. Before irradiation, the reaction system was sealed and vacuumed to remove any gas impurities. A 300 W Xe lamp (MIF-W, Japan) with a 420 nm UV cut-off filter (HOYA L42) was chosen as the visible light source. The H2 evolution rate was quantified using an online gas chromatograph (Shiweipx GC-7806) equipped with a TCD detector and a molecular sieve 5A column (N2 as the carrier gas). The apparent quantum efficiency (QE) was measured using 420 nm LEDs (100 mW cm−2) under the same photocatalytic reaction conditions. The QE of rGO-CdS-3 is calculated according to the following formula:  Here, nH2 refers to the amount of photogenerated H2, and N represents the total incident photons. The amount of incident photons is calculated from the irradiation time, irradiation area, and illumination power. The amount of H2 generated for 1 h is about 170.6 μmol. From the combined measurements of the amount of photo-generated H2 and the corresponding amount of incident photons, the QE of rGO-CdS-3 is calculated to be 7.83%.
2.5. Computational details
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out by using the CASTEP module in Materials Studio. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional with the projector augmented wave (PAW) method was applied to describe the interaction between ions and electrons. The energy cutoff was set at 400 eV. The Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh for the Brillouin zone was set as 3 × 3 × 1 for GO and CdS (001) models. A vacuum region was set to be 15 Å for GO and CdS (001) models. All geometry structures and atomic positions were fully relaxed by a conjugate gradient (CG) method. The convergence standards of energy and force were selected as 10−5 eV and 0.02 eV Å−1, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
The preparation of rGO-CdS is briefly illustrated in Fig. 1. First, CdCO3 nanocubes were synthesized via a precipitation reaction between CdCl2·2.5H2O and NaHCO3. Then, the CdCO3 nanocubes were transformed into CdS nanoboxes by a hydrothermal and sulfuration method. After the surface charge modification of CdS nanoboxes with aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS), an electrostatic self-assembly strategy was adopted to synthesize the final rGO-CdS for use as a photocatalyst.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the preparation of rGO-CdS photocatalysts. 
As shown in the XRD patterns (Fig. 2), all samples with different rGO ratios show similar peaks, which are well-matched with hexagonal CdS (JCPDS 41-1049). It is worth noting that no obvious diffraction peaks of rGO were observed in rGO-CdS nanocomposites, due to their relatively low diffraction intensity.44–46

CdCO3 nanocubes with a smooth surface and a diameter of about ∼580 nm are shown in the SEM image in Fig. S1.† Then, through a solvothermal-vulcanization transformation process at 180 °C, CdCO3 nanocubes react with thiourea, and form hollow CdS nanoboxes, which are composed of subunits of CdS nanoparticles on the surface (Fig. 3a). With the hybridization of rGO (Fig. 3b), it can be clearly seen that rGO is wrapped on the surface of CdS nanoboxes, forming rGO-CdS. To obtain the details of the rGO-CdS composite, the additional high-magnification TEM image and HR-TEM image are utilized for the observation of the surface structure. In Fig. 3c, it is noteworthy that some ultrathin rGO nanosheets are attached to the surface of CdS. The HRTEM image in Fig. 3d, shows a d-spacing of 0.31 nm, corresponding to the (101) facets of hexagonal CdS nanoboxes.47–49 In addition, a close inspection of the selected area in the HRTEM image further confirms the interface contact between rGO and CdS, which verifies the successful construction of the rGO-CdS-3 photocatalyst. Such an intimate interfacial contact for the rGO-CdS-3 nanocomposites would be able to favor the charge carrier transfer process between the two components.50–53

The ultrathin rGO wrapped on CdS nanoboxes stimulates us to further examine the specific surface area, pore volume and average pore size of the as-prepared rGO-CdS-3 nanocomposites. The isotherm curves for rGO-CdS-3 and CdS are recognized as the type-IV isotherm with an H3-type hysteresis loop (Fig. 4a and b). rGO-CdS-3 possesses a larger specific surface area (21.14 cm3 g−1), higher than that of pristine CdS (13.94 cm3 g−1), which highlights the role of rGO in exposing more active sites in the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction. As for the pore size distribution, both rGO-CdS-3 and CdS reflect a mesoporous nature with pore sizes below 5 nm.

The survey XPS spectrum shows the co-existance of S, C, O, and Cd elements on the surface of rGO-CdS-3 photocatalysts (Fig. 5a). The peaks at 284.8 eV, 285.9 and 288.4 eV correspond to the CC, C–O and OC–O bonds of rGO sheets, suggesting the high reduction of GO to rGO.55 The Cd 3d spectrum shows two peaks with bonding energies of 405.1 and 412.2 eV, which can be assigned to Cd2+ in CdS.37 In the S 2p spectrum, two distinct peaks at 161.2 and 162.5 eV are attributed to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2.27

Fig. 6a shows the zeta potentials of GO and APS-CdS at pH = 7. GO shows a negative zeta potential of −55.0 mV, whereas APS-CdS exhibits a positive zeta potential of 98.4 mV. The opposite zeta potentials result in strong electrostatic attraction between GO and APS-CdS, which is beneficial for the interface charge transfer.54 Raman spectra are a powerful tool to study the structural defects of carbon-based materials. Two characteristic peaks at 1340 cm−1 (D band) and 1590 cm−1 (G band) can be observed in GO and rGO-CdS-3 (Fig. 6b). The intensity ratio of the D to G band is calculated to be 0.99 and 1.08 for GO and rGO-CdS-3, respectively, indicating that the oxygen functional groups were removed and more defect sites were introduced during the reduction process of GO to rGO. Similarly, FT-IR spectra in Fig. S2† show that the oxygen-related bands in rGO-CdS-3, become weak or even vanish, indicating the removal of oxygenated groups and effective reduction of GO to rGO.55 The UV-vis DRS in Fig. 6c show that pure CdS exhibits an absorption edge at 570 nm, corresponding to a bandgap of 2.17 eV (Fig. S3†). With increasing rGO content, all rGO-CdS nanocomposites show a progressively enhanced absorption in the visible-light region. Furthermore, the rGO-CdS nanocomposites present a negligible shift in the band edge compared to pure CdS, indicating that the bandgap remains unchanged after the coupling of CdS with rGO. The photocatalytic activities of rGO-CdS nanocomposites were evaluated toward photocatalytic H2 production under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) in the presence of the lactic acid sacrificial reagent. As shown in Fig. 6d, pure CdS nanoboxes exhibit an H2 evolution rate of 15.3 μmol h−1. Notably, the photocatalytic performance of rGO-CdS nanocomposites increases with the rGO content ranging from 2 to 3 wt%. rGO-CdS-3 shows the highest H2 evolution rate of 75.1 μmol h−1 with a QE of 7.83% at 420 nm, which is much higher than the H2 evolution rate of the physical mixture of rGO (3 wt%) and CdS (20.3 μmol h−1). Of note is a dramatic decrease in the H2 production rate of rGO-CdS-4 with rGO up to 4 wt%. A higher surface rGO coverage contributes to a large decrease in the exposed active sites of the rGO-CdS nanocomposites for photocatalytic H2 production. The excessive rGO can act as a kind of recombination center instead of providing an electron pathway, and elevate the charge carrier recombination in the rGO nanosheets.56,57 The behavior of the photogenerated charge carriers is regarded as an important method to evaluate photocatalytic activity. The hydrogen evolution rate of rGO-CdS-3 exhibited no significant decrease after 6 consecutive cycles (Fig. S4a†). Impressively, the SEM image and XRD patterns show no obvious morphology and structure change of rGO-CdS-3 after the cycle test (Fig. S4b†). As shown in Fig. 6e, rGO-CdS-3 shows the highest photocurrent responses, implying the effective generation and separation of charge carriers. The lowest PL intensity of rGO-CdS-3 in PL spectra (Fig. S5†), confirms the excellent charge separation ability.58 Furthermore, the EIS Nyquist plot in Fig. 6f shows that rGO-CdS-3 possesses a minimum semicircle radius, indicating that rGO-CdS-3 has a smaller charge transfer resistance. In addition, Fig. S6† shows the LSV curves of CdS and rGO-CdS-3. rGO-CdS-3 displays lower onset potential and higher current density than pure CdS, demonstrating that the integration of rGO with CdS can significantly promote H2 production.59

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to further investigate the interfacial charge transfer between CdS and rGO. Fig. 7a and b show the electrostatic potentials of the CdS (001) surface and GO (001) surface, respectively. The work functions of the CdS (001) surface and GO (001) surface are calculated to be 5.5 and 4.4 eV, respectively. The difference in the work function indicates the presence of charge transfer at the interface of CdS and GO. This charge transfer will result in the establishment of an interfacial build-in electric field.60 It is well known that the Fermi level (EF) is a key parameter for estimating the interface charge transfer direction between two components. Obviously, the EF of GO (001) is more negative than that of CdS (001), revealing that GO can capture photogenerated electrons from CdS.61 The results are in accordance with the reported literature.62 Besides, the conduction band level of CdS and rGO-CdS-3 are analyzed by Mott–Schottky analysis, which is −0.66 eV and −0.65 eV, respectively (specific calculation methods are shown in Fig. S7†). In combination with the values of Eg (Fig. S3†), the valence band level of CdS and rGO-CdS-3 are calculated to be 1.51 eV and 1.52 eV, respectively. Based on the above results, the energy band structure and photocatalytic mechanism diagram are illustrated in Fig. 7c. When rGO-CdS photocatalysts are irradiated under visible light, the electrons are excited from the valence band of CdS to the conduction band, and then quickly transfer to rGO under the internal electric field and Coulomb interaction, triggering the proton reduction reaction for H2 production, while the holes on the CdS surface are consumed by the scavenger. In this case, the photogenerated charge carriers are effectively separated, thereby giving rise to enhanced photocatalytic H2 production.

4. Conclusions
In summary, the rGO modified hollow CdS nanobox photocatalysts were synthesized by combining chemical precipitation, the hydrothermal method, and the electrostatic self-assembly strategy. Among all photocatalysts, rGO-CdS-3 showed a remarkable photocatalytic H2 production activity under visible light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the hollow structure, which can promote visible-light utilization by multiple light reflections. The thin shell can reduce the diffusion length of charge carriers, and the loaded rGO can increase visible light absorption and provide sufficient active sites. Meanwhile, the establishment of the built-in interface electric field and Coulomb interaction in the rGO-CdS-3 photocatalyst significantly facilitate the space charge separation and accelerate the interfacial charge migration and transfer, which is beneficial to the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The experimental results coupled with DFT calculations further confirm the interfacial charge migration route from CdS to rGO. The work provides new insight into the rational design and fabrication of CdS-based nanocomposites for solar-to-chemical energy conversion.
