    , Accepted 11th September 2012First published on 13th September 2012AbstractA new polymer based on thieno[3,4-f]isoindole-5,7-dione (TID) and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene was designed and synthesized. The copolymer was characterized by elemental analysis, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra as well as electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests. Compared to PBDTTPD, introducing the quinoid unit could elevate the HOMO energy level and lower the LUMO energy level of the polymer, and consequently, the band gap can be reduced very effectively. The electronic structures of the two polymers were also studied by DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G level. When a polymer solar cell (PSC) device was fabricated with an active layer of a blend of PBDTTID and PC61BM using 3% (v/v) diiodooctane (DIO) as a solvent additive, a high Voc of 0.80 V was obtained, with a PCE of 3.12% under AM 1.5G conditions. The PBDTTID-based PSC device shows a slightly lower Voc but better Jsc and FF than the PBDTTPD-based PSC device, and the preliminary results indicate that TID will be a desirable building block for designing photovoltaic polymers with low-lying HOMO energy levels, as well as low band gaps.
Introduction
In recent years, the polymer solar cell (PSC) has attracted considerable attention for the next generation of renewable energy technology due to its potential for making low cost and light weight solar panels through roll-to-roll printing techniques.1,2 Over the past 10 years, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have reached over 7%.3–13 Absorption bands and molecular energy levels are two key parameters for polymer photovoltaic materials. Great efforts have been devoted to molecular design for conjugated polymers with broad absorption bands and appropriate molecular energy levels. Building a conjugated backbone with a donor–acceptor (D–A) structure has been proved to be an effective way to tune the optical properties of conjugated polymers.14 In these polymers, electron-deficient units (acceptor units) play a very important role. By modifying the electron withdrawing effect of the acceptor unit, the band gaps and molecular energy levels of the conjugated polymers can be tuned rationally. For example, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT)15–20 is an electron-deficient unit widely used in polymer photovoltaic materials. When BT was copolymerized with different conjugated units, the band gaps of the resulting polymers varied from 1.9 eV to 1.5 eV.18,19
Another effective strategy to obtain low band gap polymers is to introduce conjugated components with strong quinoid properties into the conjugated main chain. The polymers based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) provide excellent examples.3,4,9,13,20–22 The alternative copolymer of BDT and thiophene showed a band gap of 2.0 eV;23 after introducing a fused thiophene ring on the thiophene units, a band gap of 1.5 eV could be realized.21 Thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (TPZ)24 is another conjugated component with strong quinoid properties, and TPZ-based copolymers commonly exhibit very low band gaps. For example, the alternative copolymer of BDT and TPZ exhibited a band gap of 1.2 eV,23 which is much lower than that of PBDTTT.
As a fused conjugated unit, thieno[3,4-f]isoindole-5,7-dione (TID) consists of a six-membered ring and a five-membered ring, and since the six-membered ring on TID can form a stable aromatic electron structure, as shown in Scheme 1, the quinoid structure of TID can be stabilized well.25 In the three above mentioned conjugated components with strong quinoid properties, the photovoltaic performances of TT and TPZ-based polymers have been well investigated and quite a few works have been reported. Although TID has been found to be a useful unit to build low band gap polymers, the photovoltaic properties of TID-based polymers have been seldom reported.26,27

Characterization

1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker Arx-400 spectrometer. Absorption spectra were taken on a Hitachi U-3010 UV-vis spectrophotometer. The molecular weight of the polymers was measured by the GPC method, and polystyrene was used as a standard using chloroform (CHCl3) as eluent. TGA measurements were performed on a TA Instruments, Inc. TGA-2050. DSC measurements were performed on a TA Instruments, Inc. DSC-2910. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry experiments were conducted on a CHI650D Electrochemical Workstation with a glassy carbon disk, Pt wire, and a Ag/Ag+ electrode as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively in a 0.1 mol l−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution. AFM measurements were performed on a Bruker Veeco MultiMode 8 Atomic Force Microscope, and TEM measurements were performed on Transmission Electron Microscopes (TEM): JEM-2200FS.
Fabrication and characterization of PSCs
Polymer solar cells with device structures of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Polymer:PC61BM/Ca/Al were fabricated as follows: a 30 nm layer of PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)) was spin-coated onto pre-cleaned ITO (indium tin oxide) glass substrates, and then the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen filled glovebox. A mixture of polymer–PC61BM in dichlorobenzene was spin-coated as a film on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The thickness of the active layer was ∼100 nm. The devices were completed by evaporation, and a 20 nm thick layer of Ca and a 80 nm thick layer of Al, with an area of 4 mm2 as defined by masks, were used as metal electrodes.
Hole mobility measurement
The device was fabricated with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC61BM/Au for the hole mobility measurement based on the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model.
According to the equation:  where μ0 is the zero-field mobility, E0 is the characteristic field, J is the current density, ε is the dielectric constant of the polymer, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, L is the thickness of the polymer layer, V = Vappl − Vbi, Vappl is the applied potential, and Vbi is the built-in potential (in this device structure, Vbi = 0.2 V), the hole mobility can be calculated as 2.34 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and structural characterization
The molecular structure and synthetic approach for PBDTTID are shown in Scheme 1. Compound (1) was prepared by the reported method,25 and the monomer, compound (4), was prepared in three steps in good yield. The final product, PBDTTID, was prepared by the Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction between the two monomers using toluene–DMF (5:1) as the solvent and Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of PBDTTID is 52.3 K with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.56, determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using CHCl3 as the eluent. The polymer exhibits good solubility in common solvents, such as CHCl3, chlorobenzene (CB), and dichlorobenzene (DCB). The thermal stability of PBDTTID was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The temperature of the onset point of 5% weight loss (Td) is around 332 °C. This result indicates that the thermal stability of the copolymer is good enough for application in PSCs. From differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements, we found that no clear glass transition was observed in the range of 0–300 °C under an inert atmosphere. The TGA and DSC plots are shown in the ESI.†
Optical and electrochemical properties
In order to demonstrate the influence of the quinoid effect, a polymer named PBDTTPD (as shown in Scheme 1) was prepared by the method reported by Leclerc et al.,28 and used as a reference material in this work. Fig. 1a shows the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of PBDTTID and PBDTTPD as solid films and in CHCl3 solutions. As shown in Fig. 1a, the absorption edge of the PBDTTPD film is located at 690 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 1.8 eV, and this result is consistent with the reported result.28 For PBDTTID, the solution shows an absorption peak at 571 nm, and the film exhibits a peak at 630 nm. From the solution state to the solid film, a red shift of ca. 50 nm can be observed, and the optical band gap (Eoptg) of PBDTTID is 1.53 eV. Based on these results, it is very clear that after introducing the quinoid structure, the band gap of the polymer can be effectively reduced from 1.80 eV to 1.53 eV.

Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was employed to measure the molecular energy levels of the material.29 The cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of PBDTTID and PBDTTPD are shown in Fig. 1b. On the basis of the onset potentials, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the control polymer, PBDTTPD, were estimated to be −5.52 eV and −3.70 eV, respectively, which agrees well with reported results.23 Interestingly, the new polymer PBDTTID exhibits a HOMO level of −5.40 eV, which is 0.12 eV higher than that of PBDTTPD; the LUMO level of PBDTTID is −3.78 eV, which is 0.08 eV lower than that of PBDTTPD.
Comparison of these two polymers indicates that the electrochemical band gap of the polymer can be effectively lowered by introducing the quinoid structure, due to elevation of its HOMO level and reduction of its LUMO level.
It is well known that open circuit voltage (Voc) of a polymer solar cell with bulk-heterojunction structure is closely related to the gap between the HOMO level of the electron donor material and the LUMO level of the electron acceptor material in the blend film,30,31 and therefore the design of a polymer electron donor material with a deep HOMO level is key to obtaining efficient photovoltaic devices.32 The low-lying HOMO level and the narrow band gap of PBDTTID indicate that this polymer might be a potential electron donor material in PSCs.
Density functional theory calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to demonstrate the electronic structures of the two polymers, e.g. the HOMO and LUMO surfaces, with a molecular main chain length n = 3, at the B3LYP/6-31G level of theory.33 As shown in Fig. 2, the HOMO surface of PBDTTID is distributed along the conjugated backbone evenly, but its LUMO surface is mainly located at the TID units. For PBDTTPD, both the HOMO and the LUMO surfaces are distributed along the backbone evenly.

Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of PBDTTID were investigated by fabricating PSC devices with a ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTID:PC61BM/Ca/Al structure, where PBDTTID was used as the electron donor material and PC61BM was used as the electron acceptor material in the active layer. Different D–A weight ratios, such as 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 have been scanned to optimize the device performance. Fig. 3a shows the I–V curves of the PSC devices based on PBDTTID under illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, and the corresponding characteristics of the solar cells are summarized in Table 1. The best performance was obtained at a weight ratio of 1:1, and a PCE of 1.47% with a Voc of 0.83 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 3.43 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.52 were recorded. Moreover, the photovoltaic performance of the PSC device can be further improved by using 3% (v/v) diiodooctane (DIO) as a solvent additive.34 After being processed with DIO, the device's Jsc significantly increased from 3.43 mA cm−2 to 6.5 mA cm−2. As a result, the PCE increased to 3.12%. To make a clear comparison, PSC devices based on the analogue copolymer PBDTTPD were fabricated and tested under the same conditions, and the results are listed in Table 1. The PBDTTPD-based device exhibits a PCE of 0.92%, and the Voc, Jsc and FF are 0.87 V, 2.35 mA cm−2 and 0.45, respectively. It is obvious that the PBDTTID-based device exhibits a slightly lower Voc, but better Jsc and FF compared to the PBDTTPD-based device. Moreover, the hole mobility of the active layer of the best device was measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method,35 and the hole mobility can be estimated to be 2.34 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1.

Fig. 3b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve of the PSC device with optimal photovoltaic performance. The integral current density based on the EQE curve is ∼6.3 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the result from the I–V measurement. It can be seen that the response range of the device covers almost the whole visible wavelength range from 300 nm to 750 nm, but the peak value of EQE is only 25%. It is obvious that the photovoltaic performance of the PBDTTID-based device is limited by the low EQE.
From the device results, it was found that using DIO as a solvent additive plays an important role in improving the photovoltaic performance of the devices. According to the reported works, appropriate phase separation is necessary to form bicontinuous channels which facilitate charge transport in the donor–acceptor blend. Therefore, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to reveal the morphology of the PBDTTID/PC61BM blend films prepared with and without DIO. The AFM and TEM images are shown in Fig. 4. It is clear that, compared with the blend film prepared from DCB solution without using DIO as a solvent additive, after using DIO, a smaller domain size can be observed, e.g. ∼20 nm for a nanoscale structure. This morphology is favourable for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport, resulting in a higher PCE,36 and this phenomenon is consistent with reported works.9,37

Conclusions
In conclusion, a new photovoltaic polymer with strong quinoid properties, PBDTTID, was designed and synthesized. The polymer exhibits good solubility in common solvents and good thermal stability below 332 °C. UV-vis measurements indicated the polymer thin film exhibited broad absorption in the region from 300 nm to 800 nm, and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer are −5.40 eV and −3.78 eV, respectively, estimated from electrochemical cyclic voltammetry measurements. The electronic structures of the of the two polymers were also studied by DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G level. Compared to PBDTTPD, the counterpart of PBDTTID, the influence of the quinoid structure on the polymer's properties can be clearly seen. By introducing the quinoid unit, the HOMO level of the polymer is elevated and the LUMO level is lowered, and consequently the band gap of the polymer can be reduced very effectively. The PBDTTID-based PSC device shows a slightly lower Voc but better Jsc and FF than the PBDTTPD-based PSC device. Considering that the former shows much broader response range than the latter, it can be concluded the introduction of the quinoid structure has a very positive effect on the photovoltaic properties of the polymer. Since the preliminary polymer, PBDTTID, exhibits some promising photovoltaic properties, like high Voc, good FF and a broad response range, it might be a potential photovoltaic polymer. Furthermore, TID will be a desirable building block towards the design of photovoltaic polymers with a low-lying HOMO level as well as a low band gap.
