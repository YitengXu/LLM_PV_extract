    , Accepted 13th February 2019First published on 14th February 2019AbstractCuSCN, a low-cost inorganic hole transporting material (HTM), exhibits notably high hole-mobility and material stability, but turns out to show significantly lower open circuit voltage (VOC) than organic hole-conductors in its application as an HTM in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, for the enhancement of VOC, various functional molecules were introduced on the surface of a CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) layer to passivate the defects and to improve the contact between MAPbI3 and CuSCN layers. In particular, by introducing a mixture of 3-pyridyl isothiocyanate (Pr-ITC) and phenylene-1,4-diisothiocyanate (Ph-DITC), the VOC of the CuSCN-based PSC (PSC-CuSCN) was increased over 40 mV, due to their unique molecular structures possessing two separate functional groups that can interact with MAPbI3 as well as CuSCN. By this interfacial treatment, the fabricated CuSCN-based PSC device exhibits an average photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.57% (PCE of 19.17% for the champion device), which is very close to the photovoltaic performance of the PSC with spiro-OMeTAD (PSC-spiro, average PCE of 19.03%). Also, the hysteresis in J–V measurements has been minimized, suggesting no appreciable charge accumulation at the perovskite/CuSCN interface by successful passivation of defects. Moreover, the long-term stability of PSC-CuSCN devices was further improved: after 200 days at a relative humidity of 30 ± 5%, 86% of the initial PCE remained for the PSC-CuSCN with surface treatment, whereas only 73% and 56% remained for the bare PSC-CuSCN and PSC-spiro, respectively.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which employ CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br or I) belonging to the perovskite family of ABX3 formula as a light absorber, have drawn rapidly expanding research attention mainly due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and very low fabrication cost.1–6 In typical PSC devices, CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) with a large extinction coefficient (>105 cm−1 at 500 nm) is sandwiched by an electron-transporting layer (ETL) and a hole-transporting layer (HTL) to achieve efficient charge separation and collection.
Mostly, organic hole-transporting materials (HTMs) such as spiro-OMeTAD and polytriarylamine (PTAA) have been used to fabricate HTLs, whereas inorganic oxides such as TiO2, ZnO and SnO2 have been used to form ETLs.7–13 In general, organic HTMs show favorable energy band matching with the perovskite light-absorber and outstanding processability that facilitates wet-chemical coating over the perovskite layer, thus rendering high photovoltaic performance for the fabricated devices. However, they are highly expensive with drawbacks in hole-mobility and material stability. As alternatives to organic HTMs, several inorganic materials such as CuI,14,15 CuSCN,16–20 NiO,21–23 CuxO,24,25 Cu-based delafossite oxides such as CuCrO2, CuGaO2, and CuAlO2,26–29 and others30,31 have also been investigated as a HTM in PSC devices. Among them, particularly, CuSCN exhibits promising properties and is considered to be a potential candidate to replace organic HTMs. Specifically, CuSCN not only exhibits significantly higher hole mobility (0.01–0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1) than typical organic HTMs such as spiro-OMeTAD (4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) or PTAA (∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) but also has an appropriate HOMO level, extended material stability and extremely low price.32–34 A prominently high PCE over 20% was also reported by employing CuSCN as the HTM for mesoscopic PSC devices.35
In spite of many advantages, typical CuSCN-based PSC (PSC-CuSCN) devices show comparatively poorer photovoltaic properties than the devices with organic HTMs. In particular, significantly lower open circuit voltage (VOC) has been observed for the PSC-CuSCN, originating from the damage of the underlying perovskite layer during the coating of CuSCN and also the poor contact between the perovskite and CuSCN layers.36,37 Alkyl sulfides used as solvents for CuSCN can damage the perovskite layer, leading to formation of defects on its surface. It has been reported that the defect sites formed on the perovskite surface trap charges and provide recombination pathways, resulting in the decrease of VOC.36–38 Conventionally, a CuSCN layer is deposited by the doctor blade method,16,17,39 but recently several coating technologies such as spin coating40–42 and spray deposition43,44 have been developed to minimize damage on the underlying perovskite layer. Nonetheless, the issue of the relatively smaller VOC has not been resolved yet. In principle, the inorganic CuSCN film does not cover the perovskite layer completely because the coated CuSCN forms a texturized grain structure by crystallization and attractive interaction between CuSCN and the perovskite is not high. In other words, in contrast to organic HTMs, the CuSCN layer cannot form a continuous contact with the perovskite layer, thus inducing the formation of non-contacting sites which may work as charge recombination centers.14,36,45
Previously, several researchers have studied the interface control between the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD layers. Iodopentafluorobenzene,46 dodecyltrimethoxysilane,47 thiophene, pyridine,48 several para-substituted benzenethiols49 and others were introduced to passivate defects or modify the surface properties of the perovskite layer. Particularly, Snaith et al. reported that pyridine is a suitable molecule for treating the surface of the perovskite layer in PSC devices employing spiro-OMeTAD.48 The defects on the perovskite surface can be passivated by the unpaired electrons in the nitrogen atom of pyridine, thus inducing a significant increase in VOC and PCE.
Thus far, however, the interface control for CuSCN-based PSC devices has not been investigated in spite of urgent need to resolve the problem of the VOC drop. Recently, Park et al. introduced a thin 2-D perovskite layer on the top of the perovskite layer and achieved a significant increase of the PCE,19 suggesting that the control of the perovskite/CuSCN interface is a crucial subject for enhancing the photovoltaic performance of CuSCN-based PSC devices.
Herein, we investigated the interfacial treatment with functional molecules on the surface of the perovskite layer to passivate the defects and improve the contact between the perovskite and CuSCN layers. For this purpose, the functional molecules are required to possess two separate functional groups, which have good binding affinity to both the perovskite and CuSCN. For the CuSCN-based PSC devices pyridine will be obviously useful for the passivation of defects formed on the perovskite surface, but the aromatic part of pyridine does not show good binding affinity to CuSCN. Hence, we initially tested various pyridine derivatives to find out suitable functional groups showing high binding affinity to CuSCN. Then we determined the optimal functional molecules that offer the highest binding affinity to the perovskite as well as CuSCN. By interfacial treatment with the novel functional molecules discovered in this work, the VOC and PCE of CuSCN-based PSCs were remarkably increased. Furthermore, by employing transient absorption (TA) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) spectroscopies, the effect of the interfacial molecular layer on the dynamics of charge transfer to the HTM was systematically analyzed.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Fabrication of FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3
As a TiO2 compact layer, an approximately 10 nm-thick Ti layer was deposited on patterned FTO glass (Pilkington, TEC-8) using an RF magnetron sputtering system (A-Tech system, Korea), followed by oxidation at 500 °C for 30 min in air. A mesoporous TiO2 layer with ∼170 nm thickness was prepared by spin-coating at 6000 rpm for 30 s by using TiO2 paste derived from 50 nm-sized TiO2 nanoparticles.7,43,50,51 The coated films were then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. A MAPbI3 layer was deposited by a so-called one-step method. 461 mg of PbI2 (99.9985%, Alfa Aesar) and 159 mg of methylamine were added to a mixture of 600 mg dimethylformamide (99.8%, Aldrich) and 78 mg dimethyl sulfoxide (99.9%, Aldrich). 60 μL of perovskite solution was added dropwise on the prepared electrode with a size of 2 cm × 2 cm, and then spun at 4000 rpm for 20 s. After 10 s of spinning, 100 μL of diethyl ether was added dropwise on the spun substrate, followed by annealing on a hot plate at 65 °C for 1 min and then 100 °C for 5 min.
2.2 Preparation of interfacial molecular layers (IMLs)
Various functional molecules were employed for the formation of IMLs on the perovskite surface. Typically, 70 μL of 0.01 M solution dissolved in toluene was added dropwise and stayed for 3 s on the FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3 substrate, followed by spinning for 30 s at 5000 rpm. The coated film was then baked at 70 °C for 3 min.
2.3 Preparation of HTM layers and back contact
CuSCN layers were coated on the FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3 or FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3/IML substrates by a modified spin coating technique employing a fast-evaporation step.52–55 That is, 70 μL of 0.15 M CuSCN solution dissolved in n-propyl sulfide (Aldrich, >98%) was added dropwise onto the substrate with a size of 2 cm × 2 cm, followed by an immediate spinning at 4000 rpm for 20 s. After 3 s of the spinning, hot wind was blown to the substrate to minimize the damage of the perovskite layer by n-propyl sulfide. The hot air generated using a heat-gun (Electron ST, 3.4 kW) was blown vertically to the substrate from a distance of 20 cm away. After coating, the substrate was then dried on a hot plate at 80 °C for 3 min to evaporate the residual solvent and to obtain the crystallized CuSCN phase.
As a control experiment, spiro-OMeTAD was also used as the HTM with the following procedure: a solution consisting of 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD in 1.0 mL chlorobenzene, 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine, 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide in 1 mL acetonitrile, and 29 μL of tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine) cobalt(III) bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide in 1 mL acetonitrile was coated by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s.
The Au layer with a thickness of 60 nm was deposited using a thermal evaporator (Korea Vacuum Tech.) to form the back contact.
2.4 Measurements and characterizations
Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSC devices were measured under ambient conditions under irradiation of AM 1.5G one sun. The PSC devices were masked with a nonreflective black metal aperture to define the active area, typically 0.122 cm2, which was measured using an optical microscope. For measurement of J–V curves, the applied voltages were scanned in the reverse direction with a scan rate of 200 mV s−1, and the dwell time before the voltage scan was 50 ms. Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained in the wavelength range of 300–850 nm using an IPCE measurement system (PV Measurements, Inc.).
A transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) measurement was performed with a nanosecond transient absorption spectrometer (LP980, Edinburgh Instruments). The pump laser pulses of 355 nm wavelength, 5 ns duration, and 0.34 mJ per pulse were focused to a spot of 10 × 18 mm2 from the FTO substrate side of the FTO/perovskite/HTM sample under ambient conditions, giving an excitation fluence of 0.19 mJ per cm2 per pulse. A pulsed (6 ms duration) Xe arc lamp was used as a probe source. The transient change in the absorption of the sample was measured in real time with a PMT detector and a digital oscilloscope of 200 MHz bandwidth. The time resolution of the TA measurement was 7 ns. The TAS measurements were repeated multiple (at least three) times for each type of PSC sample to check the reproducibility of the TA data. TR-PL was measured with a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) spectrometer (FluoTime 200, PicoQuant). The excitation wavelength and the detection wavelength of the TR-PL measurement were 393 nm and 768 nm, respectively, and its time resolution was ∼200 ps.
3. Results and discussion
Various functional molecules were tested as interfacial molecular layers (IMLs) to passivate the defects on the perovskite surface and improve the contact between the perovskite light-absorber and CuSCN HTM layers. The preparation scheme for MAPbI3/IML/CuSCN is illustrated in Fig. 1a. In general, functional groups terminated with a halogen, S or N, are considered to be appropriate candidates for interactions with Cu+ in CuSCN and Pb2+ in MAPbI3. Previously, pyridine was reported to be a suitable compound for improving the interface of perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD.48

In this regard, we initially tested various pyridine derivatives as interfacial layers. That is, to find out a suitable functional group showing strong binding affinity to CuSCN, pyridine derivatives such as pyridine (Pr), 4-iodopyridine (I-Pr), 4-dimethylammonium pyridine (DMA-Pr) and 3-pyridyl isothiocyanate (Pr-ITC), as shown in Fig. 1b, have been tested to form IMLs. Each compound dissolved in toluene was spin-coated on the FTO/TiO2/perovskite substrate, before the coating of the CuSCN layer. SEM images in Fig. 2a show the surfaces of the bare MAPbI3 film and the films coated with various functional molecules, suggesting that the grain structure and morphology of the MAPbI3 films were not appreciably modified by coating of IMLs. In addition, we obtained AFM images of the bare MAPbI3 film and the films coated with various IMLs, as shown in Fig. 2b. Upon introducing IMLs, the RMS roughnesses of MAPbI3 films were slightly increased (0–7% increase). Bare MAPbI3 and MAPbI3/DMA-Ph-ITC films showed 4.6 nm, whereas MAPbI3/Pr-ITC and MAPbI3/Ph-DITC films exhibited an RMS roughness of 4.9 and 4.8 nm, respectively. Fig. 2c shows AFM images of MAPbI3/CuSCN and various MAPbI3/IML/CuSCN films. Upon introducing IMLs, the RMS roughnesses of CuSCN films were rather decreased.

(d) Cross-sectional SEM image of a typical PSC device employing CuSCN. All scale bars in the SEM images are 400 nm. AFM images were obtained from a 1.5 μm × 1.5 μm area. 

Fig. 2d shows the cross-sectional SEM image of a typical PSC device. The thicknesses of the mesoporous TiO2 electron transporting layer (ETL), MAPbI3 light-absorber layer, CuSCN HTL and Au back contact layer are 170 nm, 400 nm, 70 nm and 60 nm, respectively.

J–V curves of various PSC devices are shown in Fig. 3a and their parameters in Table 1. The PSC device with spiro-OMeTAD (PSC-spiro) exhibits an average PCE of 19.03% with a VOC of 1.088 mV, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 22.83 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 76.59, whereas the PSC device with bare CuSCN (PSC-CuSCN) exhibits an average PCE of 17.59% with a VOC of 1.027 mV, JSC of 22.89 mA cm−2, and FF of 74.84. Considering that the HOMO location of CuSCN (−5.3 V) which is located at a more positive side than that of spiro-OMeTAD (−5.2 V), larger VOC is expected for the PSC-CuSCN devices in principle. However, in reality, PSC-CuSCN devices give significantly lower VOC values, which is caused by the defects formed on the perovskite surface facing the CuSCN layer.14,36,45 As given above and also shown in Fig. S1a,† the PSC-CuSCN shows a lower VOC than the PSC-spiro by approximately 60 mV on average. This is commonly seen in the normal-architecture PSC devices coating CuSCN over the perovskite layer, caused by intrinsically poor contact between the perovskite and CuSCN as well as the damage of perovskite surface by alkyl sulfide used as the CuSCN solvent.16–20,32–36

Here we monitored the VOC modification by the coating of various functional molecules on the perovskite layer. As a blank experiment, first, the effect of bare toluene coating was examined, because toluene can work as an anti-solvent for the perovskite layer when used as the solvent for functional molecules. XRD patterns in Fig. S2† suggest that toluene treatment does not appreciably modify the crystallinity or grain orientation of MAPbI3 films. Moreover, from the J–V curves in Fig. S3,† it was found that the increment of VOC is only 3 mV, suggesting that the improvement of the PV properties by the anti-solvent effect of toluene is negligible. Upon introducing pyridine as an IML, the VOC of the PSC device turned out to be 1.026 mV with a PCE of 16.78%, which is relatively poorer than those of the untreated PSC device. Previously, pyridine was successfully applied for passivating the surface of the perovskite layer for the PSC device with spiro-OMeTAD. In this case, the Pb2+ in the perovskite and the nitrogen atom in pyridine can have strong attractive interaction, while the aromatic part of pyridine interacts well with spiro-OMeTAD. In contrast, for the CuSCN-based PSCs, the aromatic part of pyridine does not have appreciable interaction with the CuSCN layer, leading to no improvement in contact. Therefore, the observed result clearly indicates that not only successful passivation of the defect structure of the perovskite surface but also a good contact between the perovskite and CuSCN layers is required for efficient hole transport and improved photovoltaic performance.
Upon introducing DMA-Pr as an IML, the photovoltaic properties of the PSC device deteriorate significantly, suggesting that DMA is not an eligible group to connect with CuSCN. With treatment of I-Pr, the VOC of the PSC-CuSCN device increases slightly, suggesting that the –I group exhibits a certain degree of attractive interaction with Cu+ of CuSCN. In contrast, when the Pr-ITC was applied to the interfacial layer, the VOC of the device was increased to 1.057 mV with a JSC of 22.68 mA cm−2, FF of 75.94%, and PCE of 18.20%. The remarkable increment of VOC by 0.30 mV, compared with the device without interfacial treatment, implies that the –NCS group shows an excellent binding affinity toward CuSCN.
Now, it becomes clear that the –NCS group has excellent binding affinity toward CuSCN. Then, the next step is to find out optimal functional groups providing superior binding affinity to the perovskite layer. In addition to Pr-ITC, in particular, phenyl isothiocyanate (Ph-ITC), 4-dimethylaminophenyl isothiocyanate (DMA-Ph-ITC), 4-iodophenyl isothiocyanate (I-Ph-ITC) and phenylene-1,4-diisothiocyanate (Ph-DITC) were selected as candidates (see Fig. 1b). J–V curves of the PSC devices employing these molecules in the perovskite/CuSCN interface are shown in Fig. 3b. The PSC devices with Ph-ITC or DMA-Ph-ITC do not show any improvement in the PV properties. It is considered that the phenyl and the –N(CH3)2 groups have poor chemical binding affinity toward the MAPbI3 layer. In the case of I-Ph-ITC, the –I group was expected to show good binding affinity to Pb2+ of MAPbI3, but the VOC increment was only 5 mV. In contrast, the introduction of Ph-DITC brought a notable enhancement in VOC. That is, the VOC was increased to 1.054 mV, whereas JSC and FF were not appreciably changed, leading to a PCE of 17.94%. The obtained result suggests that the S atom at the end of the –NCS group shows good binding affinity to MAPbI3, but the achieved enhancements in VOC and PCE were slightly lower than those of the devices employing Pr-ITC.
From the AFM images (Fig. 2b and c), it was found that introduction of IMLs slightly modifies the roughnesses of MAPbI3 and over-coated CuSCN layers. In particular, introduction of DMA-Ph-ITC led to the smoothest surface, but the PCE of the corresponding device was poorer than others. Thus the obtained result implies that a slight change in the roughness of MAPbI3 or CuSCN films is not a major factor in determining the PV performances.
Chemical interactions of Pr-ITC with MAPbI3 and CuSCN layers were investigated by FTIR spectroscopy. First, we used MAPbI3 powder to obtain a large surface area and also employed pyridine instead of Pr-ITC to avoid the interference by the ITC group. The detailed procedure and obtained FTIR spectra are shown in Fig. S4.† Pyridine exhibits a weak CN band at 1632 cm−1 and three C–N bands at 1030, 1068, and 1148 cm−1. The FTIR spectrum of the MAPbI3 treated with pyridine (MAPbI3/pyridine) exhibits a small quantity of pyridine present on the MAPbI3 powder. Moreover, the C–N bands at 1030 and 1068 cm−1 belonging to a1 mode were shifted to lower frequencies, implying a possibility of interaction between N of pyridine and MAPbI3, but further investigation is necessary to obtain evidence. Second, to analyze the interaction of Cu and the –NCS group in Pr-ITC, CuI was employed instead of CuSCN to avoid the interference by the –SCN group. After treating the CuI powder with Pr-ITC, the chemical environment of the –NCS group in CuI/Pr-ITC was analyzed using FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. S5†). Bare Pr-ITC shows a characteristic CS band at 1097 cm−1. In CuI/Pr-ITC, the CS band became relatively weaker than other bands, and a noticeable C–S stretching band showed up at 860 cm−1. The appearance of a C–S single bond suggests that S atom in the –NCS group is bound to Cu in CuI.
Overall, the largest enhancement of VOC was achieved by introducing the Pr-ITC as an IML. It is deduced that the significant enhancement of VOC is due to unique structural functionality of Pr-ITC, which can form a Pb⋯N interaction with the perovskite and a Cu⋯S interaction with the CuSCN, resultantly suppressing charge recombination by defect passivation and expediting hole transport by tight contact between the perovskite and CuSCN layers. Noticeably, the other suitable molecule is Ph-DITC containing two separated –NCS groups, which can bind with both the perovskite and CuSCN simultaneously. Considering that the shapes of the pyridyl group and –NCS group are quite different from each other, the preferred binding sites for the Pr-ITC and Ph-DITC to the defects formed on the perovskite surface would not be the same. Thus, a mixture of Pr-ITC and Ph-DITC might be more useful to passivate the defects and to link the perovskite and CuSCN layers.

Fig. 4a shows the J–V curves of the PSC devices using the mixture of Pr-ITC and Ph-DITC (molar ratio of 50:50) for interfacial treatment. Molar ratios of 50:50 and 60:40 were found to be optimum compositions (Fig. S6†). Notably, the VOC was further increased to 1.068 V, leading to an average PCE of 18.57%, while JSC and FF were not appreciably changed. Furthermore the highest PCE observed from the 80 devices was 19.17%, as shown in Fig. S7.† The average increment of VOC was 41 mV compared with the VOC of the PSC-CuSCN devices without an interfacial layer, as shown in Fig. S1.† The obtained results indicate that the VOC and PCE values of the PSC-CuSCN devices treated with an optimal IML approach those of the PSCs with spiro-OMeTAD (VOC: of 1.088 V, PCE: 19.03%). IPCE spectra were obtained for several PSC devices, as shown in Fig. 4b. The JSC values acquired from the integration of the IPCE spectra match the values acquired from the J–V curves in Fig. 4a.

The observed result clearly indicates that the application of multiple components is more effective than using a single component for the passivation of defects. The structures of defects and their environments formed on the perovskite surface would be diverse. Hence the molecules optimized for defect passivation will be dependent on the structure of individual defects. In this regard, the mixture of Pr-ITC and Ph-DITC can provide a synergistic effect in passivating the defects on the perovskite surface and connecting the perovskite and CuSCN layers, as illustrated in Fig. 1c.
TAS was employed to analyze the dynamics of charge transfer for the various PSC-CuSCNs with various IMLs (Pyrex/MAPbI3/IML/CuSCN). The transient absorption (TA) spectrum, ΔA (λ), represents the difference between the absorption spectra of the ground state and transient excited states. We measured the TA spectra of the perovskite devices employing various functional molecules as IMLs. In Fig. 5a, the TA spectra at t = 0 measured with 355 nm excitation of the devices show a broad negative feature at 700–800 nm, which corresponds to a sum of photobleaching (PB) and stimulated emission (SE) of the direct bandgap transition.56–59Fig. 5b shows temporal decays of the TA spectra at 780 nm, and the parameters of a single-exponential fit of the decays are listed in Table 2. It can be seen that ΔA at t = 0 becomes smaller (that is, less negative) in the order of bare CuSCN > Ph-DITC ≈ Pr-ITC > Pr-ITC + Ph-DITC > spiro-OMETAD. The smaller ΔA means that the decay of the TA signal is faster within the time resolution of our TA measurement (7 ns). Also, the time constant (τ1) of the TA decay at 780 nm in Table 2 becomes smaller in the same order as the trend of ΔA at t = 0. That is, the perovskite device with a smaller ΔA value at t = 0 exhibits a faster decay. The decay of the TA signal around the bandgap wavelength (780 nm) can be induced by (1) radiative/nonradiative recombination of excited electrons and holes in the perovskite material itself (leading to the decay of PB and SE), (2) hole transfer from the perovskite to the HTM (leading to the decay of SE), (3) charge trapping at defects on the perovskite surface (leading to the decay of SE), and (4) geminate/nongeminate charge recombination after hole transfer (leading to the decay of PB). These processes are conflicting phenomena in terms of their effects on the performance of solar cells, with only the hole transfer enhancing the cell performance and the others deteriorating the cell performance. Notably, a PSC device that exhibits faster TA decay gives higher VOC and PCE values, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4. Based on the agreement between the TA decay rate and the cell performance, we can infer that the decay of the TA signal at 780 nm reflects the dynamics of hole transfer more dominantly, rather than those of charge trapping or charge recombination. We also examine the TA decays at other probe wavelengths, for example, 730 nm, 750 nm, and 800 nm (see Fig. S8†), and found that the TA decay rates and the cell performances of the PSC devices are still consistent with each other. In particular, we can see that the surface treatment of a perovskite layer with Pr-ITC and/or Ph-DTIC enhances hole transfer greatly, probably because the number of defect sites decreases by surface treatment with organic molecules and, as a result, trap-assisted charge recombination is suppressed. In particular, the PSC device treated with a mixture of Pr-ITC and Ph-DTIC exhibits a TA decay rate and PCE that approach those of the PSC devices with spiro-OMETAD.

As another piece of evidence to examine the role of the IML, we measured the time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) of PSC-CuSCNs with/without IMLs. The TR-PL measurement probes the temporal intensity change of radiative processes and the decay of TR-PL can be induced by (1) radiative/nonradiative recombination of excited electrons and holes in the perovskite material itself, (2) hole transfer from the perovskite to the HTM, and (3) charge trapping at defects on the perovskite surface. In Fig. S9,† it can be seen that the TR-PL decay becomes faster in the order of bare CuSCN < Ph-DITC/CuSCN < Pr-ITC/CuSCN, which suggests that Pr-ITC and Ph-DITC indeed improve the interfacial surface by passivating the traps.

J–V curves for forward and backward scans were acquired from the PSC-spiro, PSC-CuSCN, and PSC-CuSCN with the Pr-ITC/Ph-DITC mixture. As shown in Fig. 6a, the bare PSC-CuSCN device exhibits significantly larger hysteresis than the PSCs with spiro-OMeTAD (see Fig. S10†), which is coincident with the reports in the literature.14,36,45 It is deduced that larger hysteresis for the device with CuSCN is due to the charge accumulation at the interface of perovskite/CuSCN caused by the defects present on the perovskite surface facing the CuSCN. In contrast, however, PSC-CuSCN devices treated with the Pr-ITC/Ph-DITC mixture showed very little hysteresis in the J–V measurement. That is, the PCEs obtained by backward and forward scans were 18.57% and 18.10%, respectively, which are quite close to each other. Remarkably lower hysteresis resulting from the treatment with Pr-ITC/Ph-DITC suggests that most of the defects present on the perovskite surface were removed by introducing Pr-ITC and Ph-DITC. For the PSC-CuSCN treated with Pr-ITC + Ph-DITC, the steady-state photocurrent and power output at the maximum power point are monitored, as shown in Fig. S11.†60 The power output is stable, and the achieved PCE of ∼18.2 V is comparable with the average value acquired from the forward and reverse scans (Fig. 6a).

We also monitored device stability under humid conditions for the as-prepared devices of PSC-spiro, bare PSC-CuSCN and PSC-CuSCN treated with the Pr-ITC/Ph-DITC mixture. Particularly, the long-term stability of these PSC devices was evaluated by monitoring the J–V characteristics of the devices stored at an indoor place with a relative humidity of 30 ± 5% at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 6b, bare PSC-CuSCN shows significantly higher long-term stability than the PSC-spiro, which is consistent with previous reports.35,41,43 It is worthy of note that interfacial treatment with the Pr-ITC/Ph-DITC mixture on the perovskite/CuSCN interface further improved the long-term stability. After 200 days, 86% of the initial PCE remained for the PSC-CuSCN with Pr-ITC and Pr-DITC, whereas only 73% remained for the bare PSC-CuSCN. The obtained result suggests that the interfacial molecular layer relieves the charge accumulation at the interface and also blocks the ion migration between the perovskite and CuSCN layer.
4. Conclusions
PSC devices employing CuSCN as the HTM show a lower VOC by about 60 mV in average than those with spiro-OMeTAD. Among various functional molecules, Pr-ITC and Ph-DITC were found to be suitable molecules for interfacial treatment of the perovskite surface, leading to the increase of VOC by 30 mV and 27 mV, respectively, to the fabricated PSC-CuSCN devices. Furthermore, upon employing the 50:50 mixture of Pr-ITC and Ph-DITC, the VOC of PSC-CuSCN was further increased by 41 mV. That is, the fabricated PSC-CuSCN device exhibits a PCE of 18.57% with a VOC of 1068 mV, JSC of 22.85 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.7608, close to the performance of PSC-spiro. It is deduced that application of multiple components is more effective than using a single component for the effective passivation of defects because the defect structures or the environment near the defects of the perovskite layer would not be the same. Also, hysteresis in the J–V measurement was minimized, which suggests removal of defects on the perovskite surface. Furthermore, the stability of PSC-CuSCN devices at a relative humidity of 30 ± 5% under ambient conditions was further improved by this interfacial treatment. After 200 days, 86% of the initial PCE remained for the PSC-CuSCN with surface treatment, whereas only 73% remained for the bare PSC-CuSCN.
