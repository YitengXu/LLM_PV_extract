    , Accepted 4th January 2021First published on 26th January 2021AbstractThis review deals with the chemical storage of green hydrogen in the form of Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC) systems. LOHC systems store hydrogen by an exothermal catalytic hydrogenation reaction that converts the hydrogen-lean compounds of the LOHC system to their hydrogen-rich counterparts. All compounds of a technically suitable LOHC system are liquids and this offers the advantage of simple logistics of chemically bound hydrogen in the existing infrastructure for fuels. On demand, hydrogen can be released from the hydrogen-rich LOHC molecule in an endothermal catalytic dehydrogenation at low hydrogen pressure (typically below 5 bar). Our contribution deals first with available sources of green hydrogen for a future hydrogen economy and then describes established technical processes to produce clean hydrogen from technically hydrogen-rich gas mixtures. Subsequently, the review focuses on the hydrogenation of aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds as the key step of the LOHC-based hydrogen storage cycle. Special emphasis is given to the hydrogen-charging of hydrogen-lean LOHC compounds with various gas mixtures demonstrating that such a Mixed Gas Hydrogenation (MGH) process offers the technical potential to selectively extract hydrogen in a chemically bound form that enables very efficient hydrogen logistics. In this way, low cost hydrogen sources can be connected to high value hydrogen application, e.g. hydrogen filling stations for clean mobility applications, to enable a future hydrogen economy.
1 Introduction
Hydrogen is currently used on a large industrial scale in the refining of mineral oil industries, and in the production of materials (e.g. steel, plastics, synthetic resins), bulk chemicals (e.g. ammonia, methanol) and fine chemicals.1 With an increasing shift away from fossil fuels, hydrogen will play in the future an even more important role in the chemical industry, in the energy sector and for mobility applications. The anticipated strong rise in hydrogen demand provokes two main technological questions: (i) how is this additional need for hydrogen covered? (ii) how to provide the needed hydrogen at the time and location of demand?
To comply with sustainability and emission reduction targets, hydrogen demand in the future must be covered by green hydrogen. In this review, we consider the following green hydrogen production options (Fig. 1):
 Fig. 1  Green hydrogen production routes. 
(a) Hydrogen that is produced from renewable electricity, e.g. by water electrolysis;
(b) Hydrogen that is produced from biomass, e.g. by conversion of biomethane;
(c) Stranded hydrogen, that is produced as the coupling product of an industrial production process, e.g. in the production of chlorine in chloro alkaline electrolysis, and that is currently not used adequately due to economic, logistic or infrastructural constraints.
We will also consider the option to produce hydrogen from fossil methane but without CO2 emissions. This can be realized by carbon capture and storage or by the production of solid carbon together with the hydrogen production. The first case is typically referred to as blue hydrogen,2,3 the second as turquoise hydrogen.4–6 The ‘greener touch in the second case is due to the avoidance of fossil CO2 production. Note that the production of hydrogen from biomethane combined with solid carbon production and storage provides a chance to produce hydrogen with a negative CO2 footprint. CO2 collected from the atmosphere during plant growth is converted to solid carbon that can be deposited.7
None of the technologies shown in Fig. 1 is able to produce high-purity hydrogen without further extensive purification. Conventional purification of hydrogen is based on distillation, absorption, adsorption and membrane technologies.1,8–10 By far the largest share of the produced hydrogen is used today immediately at the location of production. Only a very small part is distributed over typically short distances (typically in a range of less than 150 km). For conventional hydrogen logistics, the volumetric density of hydrogen is increased by either high pressure (compression hydrogen, CH2) or by liquefaction at very low temperatures (liquefied hydrogen, LH2).11,12
Traditional ways of chemical hydrogen storage include the production of methane, methanol or ammonia from CO2 or nitrogen, respectively. These substances are transportable and storable chemical goods and used as basic chemicals or fuels. Since their reconversion to pure hydrogen requires complex process sequences of decomposition and purification units, these compounds are typically not applied for hydrogen production. This contradicts in a strict sense the classification of these molecules as hydrogen storage compounds.
In a future hydrogen economy, hydrogen logistics will play a crucial role, e.g. in transporting hydrogen from preferred sites of renewable energy harvesting, such as wind farms in Northern Europe, to hydrogen consumption sites, such as steel manufacturing sites in central Europe.
An interesting technology for hydrogen logistics that has seen rapid scientific and technological progress in the recent years is chemical hydrogen storage in liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) systems.13–16 LOHC systems consist of at least one hydrogen-lean compound and one hydrogen-rich compound. Hydrogen is stored by an exothermal catalytic hydrogenation reaction of the hydrogen-lean LOHC compound at high hydrogen pressure. Hydrogen storage in the form of the resulting hydrogen-rich, liquid LOHC compound offers the advantage of simple logistics in the existing infrastructure for fuels. On demand, the hydrogen-rich LOHC compound releases hydrogen in an endothermal catalytic dehydrogenation at low hydrogen pressure. In the past, a number of LOHC systems have been evaluated. Most of them are based on aromatic or heteroaromatic compounds in their hydrogen-lean state.17,18 Hydrogen storage using the LOHC technology requires efficient hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of the respective hydrogen-lean and hydrogen-rich compounds. Only if both reactions proceed with high productivity, excellent selectivity and effective heat integration within the applied devices and process chains, the technology can leverage its full technological potential.
LOHC dehydrogenation catalysis (i.e. the hydrogen release reaction) has already been in the focus of a number of review papers. From these reports, it can be assumed that highly pure hydrogen can be provided at the point-of-use by the dehydrogenation of hydrogen-rich LOHC compounds.14,19–23 In addition, the LOHC dehydrogenation step has been in the focus of most reports on demonstration projects for hydrogen logistics using the LOHC technology.14,24–26
In this review, we focus on the LOHC hydrogenation step which is the necessary first key step in LOHC-based hydrogen logistics. In most studies reported so far, highly pure hydrogen has been applied for the hydrogen-loading step.21,27–29 Only recently, first studies have appeared that describe the possibility to extract hydrogen from hydrogen-rich gas mixtures without a prior purification step in a so-called Mixed Gas Hydrogenation (MGH) process.4,30,31 Herein, hydrogen is separated from the gas mixture by its chemical binding to the hydrogen-lean LOHC compound. In this way, hydrogen purification and hydrogen storage take place in one process step. MGH is economically highly attractive as hydrogen in gas mixtures is much less costly than purified hydrogen. Therefore, the focus of this review is on LOHC charging with various industrial gas mixtures to make these inexpensive sources of industrial hydrogen available for future hydrogen applications.
2 Sources of green hydrogen-rich gas mixtures
2.1 Electrochemical water splitting
Water electrolysis using renewable electricity is an obvious and very important way to produce green hydrogen in a fully sustainable and emission-free manner. In this process, water is decomposed by electrical energy in an electrolysis cell at two electrodes into its gaseous components hydrogen (negatively charged cathode side) and oxygen (positively charged anode side), according to eqn (1). H2O ⇌ H2 + 0.5O2, ΔH0 = 285.8 kJ mol−1(1) Anode: H2O ⇌ 0.5O2 + 2H+ + 2e−(2) Cathode: 2H+ + 2e− ⇌ H2(3)
In the course of time, three water electrolysis technologies have been developed and are available today: Alkaline Electrolysis (AEL), Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Electrolysis (PEMEL) and Solid Oxide Electrolyser Cell (SOEC). Here, we will briefly describe the working principle for the example of PEM electrolysis.
In a PEM electrolysis cell, proton exchange takes place via a solid membrane, usually consisting of Nafion. The membrane layer is less than 0.2 mm thick and simultaneously represents the electrolyte.32 The membrane, which conducts only protons, is embedded between two electrically conductive electrodes, and electrically isolates the two electrodes (Fig. 2). When a voltage is applied, the water molecules are split at the anode according to eqn (2). At the cathode, protons and electrons recombine to hydrogen, according to eqn (3).33,34

The PEM electrolyzer (PEMEL) cells are typically operated at 0.5–2.5 A cm−2 and a cell voltage of 1.7–2.1 V. A single stack currently contains about 10 to 120 cells with an active area per cell of up to 100 cm2. PEM electrolysers are commercially available with an energetic efficiency of 60–73% (based on the calorific value of hydrogen). The energy requirement of a PEM electrolyser is in the range of 4.1–5.0 kW h m−3 H2 and is only slightly dependent on scale. The energy consumption of peripheral components, on the other hand, is strongly dependent on scale. While very small systems have a total energy consumption of 6.0–8.0 kW h m−3 H2, the energy requirement of the system can be reduced below 6.0 kW h m−3 H2 from above 10 m3 per hour. PEM electrolysers are usually operated at 30 bar and at a temperature of 50–80 °C.32,34,35
With PEM electrolyzers, a state-of-the-art hydrogen purity of at least 99.8% can be achieved without any gas purification. The hydrogen is contaminated with water and a maximum amount of 100 ppm oxygen. With increasing operating time, the membrane becomes thinner, which can lead to a reduction in gas quality or leakage formation.34,36 Furthermore, gas purities decrease in partial load operation due to lower absolute gas production. According to the current state of the art, about 30000 operating hours can be achieved in industrial plants. For some niche applications, e.g. military and space, an operating time of up to 100000 hours has been proven.33,37 Further typical degradation mechanisms are corrosion, decomposition and agglomeration of the catalyst, titanium embrittlement and sealing problems. Future challenges will also include mechanical loads due to pressure fluctuations caused by fluctuating electricity input and start–stop processes.34 Downstream of the electrolyzer, a purification process is typically used to purify the hydrogen. First, the oxygen content is catalytically reduced to below 10 ppm. The hydrogen is then purified by cryogenic or adsorptive methods to at least 99.999% purity, depending on the requirements of the hydrogen application. The energy required for this fine purification corresponds to about 3–8% of the energy stored in the hydrogen.34,38 In addition to this two-stage method, the literature also describes research activities dealing with in situ purification of hydrogen with modified membranes.39
In the last five years, the number of projects for stationary PEM electrolysis applications has increased significantly. At the beginning of 2015, Proton OnSite launched 1 MW and 2 MW electrolyzer systems, which were the world's first commercial hydrogen production systems with capacity in the MWel range based on the PEMEL technology.40 In the same year, the world's largest PEMEL-based plant with a maximum electrical power consumption of 6 MWel was taken into operation at the Mainz Energy Park, Germany. Larger plants with a capacity of up to 20 MW have been announced and are currently (as of November 2020) under construction.41,42 PEMEL is highly suitable to deal with intermittent energy sources such as wind power or photovoltaics due to its modular design and high flexibility in the partial load range.
2.2 Conversion of hydrocarbons
The conventional industrial production of hydrogen is carried out by fossil hydrocarbon conversion. The dominant processes can be divided into the reforming of gaseous and liquid feedstocks (natural gas, naphtha, LNG) and the gasification of viscous and solid feedstocks (heavy oil, coal).43 In addition, hydrogen production using biogenic feedstocks (biogas, vegetable oil, biomass, waste) becomes increasingly important.43–47 The conversion of fossil and biogenic hydrocarbons produces around 3070 billion m3 of synthesis gas per year, primarily for the production of ammonia (144 million tons per year, 2016 ref. 42) and methanol (33 million tons per year, 2005), but also increasingly for the production of hydrogen (20 million tons per year) and synthetic fuels.48

2.2.1 Reforming of hydrocarbons. 
Reforming processes convert hydrocarbon feedstocks to synthesis gas in the presence of an oxidant. The synthesis gas consists of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water vapor and often nitrogen. The most important reforming processes are steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation (POx), autothermal reforming (ATR) and dry reforming (DR). As seen from eqn (4)–(8), the reforming processes (here exemplified for methane as feedstock) differ essentially in the nature of the oxidant which leads to marked differences in the process conditions and the H2/CO ratio of the produced synthesis gas. SR: CH4 + H2O ⇌ CO + 3H2, ΔH0 = 206 kJ mol−1(4) POx: CH4 + 0.5O2 ⇌ CO + 2H2, ΔH0 = 40 kJ mol−1(5) ATR: CH4 + xO2 + (2 − 2x)H2O ⇌ CO + (4 − 2x)H2(6) DR: CH4 + CO2 ⇌ 2CO + 2H2, ΔH0 = 247 kJ mol−1(7) WGS: CO + H2O ⇌ CO2 + H2, ΔH0 = −41 kJ mol−1(8)
Downstream of the hydrocarbon reforming process, the CO in the synthesis gas is often converted with steam to additional H2 and CO2. This exothermal water gas-shift reaction (WGS) is displayed in eqn (8). The reachable CO conversion in WGS is strongly dependent on temperature. To maximize reaction rate and total CO conversion, WGS is typically carried out in two catalyzed steps. A high temperature shift (HT-shift) step at 300–500 °C, whereby the CO content is reduced to 2–4%, is followed by a low temperature shift (LT-shift) step at 180–280 °C leading to a residual CO content of 0.1–0.4%.48,49
The reforming of biomethane is less common, but a number of demonstration plants are already in place. Studies on biomethane steam reforming,50–52 dry reforming,53,54 partial oxidation50 and autothermal reforming55–57 are available in the literature.
A comprehensive study on the influence of the steam-to-carbon (S/C) ratio and the temperature during steam reforming of synthetic biogas (CH4/CO2 ratio of 60:40) was published by Kolbitsch et al.51 In this study the steam reformer produced a dry gas composition of 63% H2, 13% CO2, 23% CO and 1% CH4 at 750 °C and an S/C ratio of 2.2. This corresponds to an H2/CO ratio of 2.74. An increase in the S/C ratio allows complete CH4 conversion, but a shift in composition from CO to CO2 is observed. An increase in the reaction temperature has no effect on the H2 yield, but leads to a reduction in the H2/CO ratio. The steam reforming of synthetic biogas (CH4/CO2 ratio of 60:40) with subsequent HT-shift and LT-shift was investigated by Effendi et al.52 with the aim of optimizing the hydrogen yield and to prevent the formation of elemental carbon.
An interesting alternative is dry reforming of biomethane and CO2 to CO/H2 mixtures. The reaction applies CO2 (also contained in the biogas) to oxidize biomethane. Lau et al.54 studied the dry reforming of synthetic biogas (CH4/CO2 ratio of 60:40) in a temperature range of 400–900 °C. With increasing temperature, the CO2 and CH4 conversion rises, whereas the H2/CO ratio is below 1.0 under all examined operation conditions. At a temperature of 800 °C, a dry gas composition of 40% H2, 2% CO2, 42% CO and 16% CH4 was obtained. In order to increase the CH4 conversion, a defined quantity of extra oxygen was added to the feed. Through this oxidative reforming, a complete CH4 conversion was possible.
In the European research project BioRobur, as well as its follow-up project BioRobur Plus, the autothermal reforming of biogas for hydrogen production was investigated. The project partners could successfully demonstrate the reforming of the fuel on a scale of 50 m3 H2 per hour.57 A synthesis gas with a wet composition of 32.3% H2, 14.1% CO2, 8.5% CO, 1.2% CH4, 21.5% N2 and 22.4% H2O was produced at a temperature of 600 °C, a steam-to-carbon (S/C) ratio of 2.0 and an oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratio of 0.8.57 This corresponds to an H2/CO ratio of 2.07.


2.2.2 Gasification of biogenic raw materials. 
Since the 17th century, the gasification of carbon-containing feedstocks has been considered as a method of generating fuel gases. After drying, comminution or pyrolysis, the starting material is converted in the presence of an oxidizing agent, usually (air) oxygen, in the gasification reactor at temperatures of 800–2000 °C and a pressure of up to 40 bar. The synthesis gas contains H2, CO, CO2, H2O, CH4 as well as traces of HCN, HCl, H2S and COS, depending on the nature of the applied feedstock. Gasification also produces solid residues such as coke and ash.49Table 1 shows an overview of the dry raw gas composition of selected feedstocks from fossil and biogenic resources.

At present, about 18% of the hydrogen produced worldwide stems from coal gasification. In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, this production capacity has to be substituted, e.g. by gasification of biogenic feedstocks. In a transition period, also a mixed gasification of coal and biomass may gain importance. In addition to the use of specially cultivated energy plants, the utilization of forestry waste, straw and household waste is attractive.59
The majority of publications on biomass gasification aim at using the produced synthesis gas as fuel in combined heat and power plants or for further processing to methane. An extensive evaluation of concepts to produce hydrogen in biomass gasification was carried out by the German Biomass Research Centre. Their Fast Internally Circulating Fluidized Bed (FICFB) gasification process, which was successfully demonstrated in an 8 MW gasification plant in 2002, is regarded as particularly promising.60 In the BioH2-4Refineries project, a feasibility study for an 8 MW gasification plant using wood chips has been carried out.61
Another promising process for producing hydrogen-rich gas mixtures from biomass is the Absorption Enhanced Reforming (AER) process, which was developed in the AER Gas I project funded by the European Union.60,62 Herein, CO2 is removed absorptively from the reaction zone of the gasifier. In comparison to the FICFB process, the temperature is reduced from 800 °C to 600–700 °C.60 A dry gas composition of 67.5% H2, 10.3% CO2, 3.3% CO and 18.9% short-chain alkanes was achieved in initial investigations on laboratory scale.63 With a 100 kW demonstration plant, a hydrogen content of up to 75% was successfully demonstrated at the Vienna University of Technology.62 In the follow-up project AER Gas II, the AER process was successfully transferred to commercial scale in an 8 MW gasification plant.64


2.2.3 Catalytic methane decomposition. 
A major disadvantage of conventional reforming processes is the formation of CO2 emissions. In the case of applying biomass as the starting material this leads to a CO2-neutral process. If CO2 by-product formation can be avoided, however, a hydrogen production process from biomass is characterized by a negative CO2-footprint. In this context, the endothermal catalytic methane decomposition (CMD) is a very interesting subject of research.4,5,65,66 In this process, methane is converted into elemental carbon and hydrogen according to eqn (9). CMD: CH4 ⇌ C + 2H2, ΔH0 = 75.6 kJ mol−1(9)
While thermal decomposition of methane requires process temperatures above 1200 °C, this temperature can be reduced to 550 °C using catalysts at the expense of an incomplete methane conversion.5,67 Supported nickel, iron and cobalt catalysts are discussed in the literature as suitable catalysts.53,68 In contrast to reforming processes, the synthesis gas of CMD contains no carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide. It consists exclusively of hydrogen and methane. At a conversion of 30–45%, a hydrogen content of over 50% has been demonstrated.69

2.3 Stranded industrial hydrogen
Various industrial processes produce hydrogen-rich gas mixtures as by-product streams. It is assumed that about 40% of the current hydrogen demand could be recovered from industrial by-product streams.70 In the following, the most interesting, industrial hydrogen by-product sources are presented highlighting the nature of the gas mixtures and the challenges arising from the respective impurities for the later described hydrogen storage processes.

2.3.1 Steel industry. 
The conventional production of steel from iron ore takes place via the blast furnace process. Herein, pig iron is first produced from iron ore by reduction with coke, which is then processed into steel using a number of other process steps. The coke is produced by carbonizing hard coal, a process that forms tar and significant quantities of coke oven gas (COG) as by-products. The hydrogen-rich COG undergoes a series of purification processes and contains thereafter 55–60% H2, 23–27% CH4, 5–8% CO, 3–6% N2, less than 2% CO2 and small amounts of hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide and ammonia.71,72 About 20 to 50% of the COG is used as fuel in the coke oven as well as in other processes of the coking plant and nearby steelworks.73 The excess of COG cannot be used in this way and so it is burnt in torches without any energetic use. In 2015, the annual total volume of COG in China was about 210 billion m3.74 In the last couple of years various studies focused on new potential for the material and energetic use of COG in the future. Of particular interest was the separation of hydrogen75–77 as well as the production of synthesis gas by means of steam reforming,78–80 partial oxidation71,78 and dry reforming72,81–83 of COG. The dry reforming of COG is considered to be promising, since a synthesis gas with a H2/CO-ratio of about 2.0 can be generated, which is very suitable for methanol synthesis.74,84 A modern steel factory with a production capacity of 6000000 tons per year produces around 40000 m3 of COG per hour.73 Assuming that 40% of the gas quantity is used as fuel and the hydrogen content in the COG is 60%, the potential for hydrogen production is 1300 kg per hour.73


2.3.2 Refinery. 
Hydrogen for refinery processes is currently mainly produced by steam reforming of naphtha, natural gas and low-boiling hydrocarbons, as well as by partial oxidation and gasification of petroleum residues or petroleum coke.85 The hydrogen is used on-site in the hydrotreatment of naphtha and its distillates, hydrodesulphurization as well as isomerization or cracking processes. In a conventional refinery, there are various hydrogen-rich gas mixtures (by-product or off-gas streams) which are available for hydrogen recovery. The compositions of these gas mixtures are summarized in Table 2 for a small to medium-sized refinery.

The table shows that these by-product or off-gas streams are available with a hydrogen purity between 35 and 90%. The impurities are usually limited to short-chain alkanes. In total, these four material flows correspond to a hydrogen recovery potential of 470 kg per hour for the example of a small to medium-sized refinery.


2.3.3 Chloro-alkali electrolysis. 
Chlorine is used in many industrial processes. The largest uses are in the manufacturing of polymers (e.g. polyvinyl chloride).1 The global chlorine production is estimated to be 65 million tons per year (2018).87 Of the 10 million tons of chlorine produced in Europe in 2018, 83% came from plants using the membrane technology, 12% from plants using the diaphragm process and 5% from other technologies, e.g. HCl electrolysis and oxidation.88
The chloro-alkali membrane process represents the electrolysis of an aqueous sodium chloride solution in a membrane cell according to eqn (1). The chlorine ions are oxidized at the anode to form chlorine gas. At the cathode, protons (from water) are reduced by electrons (provided by electrolytic current) to hydrogen gas. Hydroxide ions are released into the solution. The ion-permeable ion exchange membrane at the center of the cell allows the sodium ions to move from the anode chamber to the cathode chamber where they react with the hydroxide ions to produce sodium hydroxide.1 2NaCl + 2H2O ⇌ Cl2 + H2 + 2NaOH(10) Anode: 2Cl− ⇌ Cl2 + 2e−(11) Cathode: 2H2O + 2e− ⇌ H2 + 2OH−(12)
For every ton of chlorine, 2.25 tons of 50% sodium hydroxide and 28.6 kg of hydrogen (under normal conditions) are produced.89 The produced excess of hydrogen is normally used as a fuel for heating or drying processes. In many production facilities, however, it cannot be used and is released into the atmosphere. With appropriate hydrogen logistics technologies at hand, this hydrogen by-product could be utilized in high-value applications at other locations in the future.

3 Conventional hydrogen logistics
Majority of the current industrial applications of hydrogen require the gas in a purity of at least 99.9% (the so-called ‘hydrogen 3.0’). For the near future a steeply growing hydrogen demand for stationary and mobile fuel cell applications is expected. Note that this anticipated strong growth of the hydrogen market comes along with much stricter hydrogen purity requirements.
The previous description of various sources of hydrogen-rich gas mixtures showed that green hydrogen from electrolysis, biomethane or industrial sources is usually contaminated with water, light alkanes, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide or traces of other impurities. The following section summarizes state of the art purification steps to convert the respective raw gas qualities in hydrogen qualities exceeding 99.9% purity.
3.1 Hydrogen purification
The choice of the best hydrogen purification technology depends on the required hydrogen purity and the amount of hydrogen required for the application under consideration. The most important processes for the purification of hydrogen are based on distillation, absorption, adsorption, and conventional as well as electrochemical membrane processes. To compare the performances of these different approaches, the achieved hydrogen purity and the Hydrogen Recovery Rate (HRR) are important criteria. The HRR indicates which proportion of the hydrogen-containing mixed gas is available as purified hydrogen after the purification process. In the following, the most important state-of-the-art hydrogen purification methods are presented to enable later in this paper a fair comparison with hydrogen purification by LOHC hydrogenation/dehydrogenation processes.

3.1.1 Cryogenic distillation. 
Separation by cryogenic distillation is based on different vapor pressures of the mixed gas containing components. The process is well suited for hydrogen purification from hydrocarbons, water, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide as these components condense at a higher temperature. Cryogenic hydrogen purification is used on an industrial scale for the separation of hydrogen from exhaust gases in refineries or in the petrochemical industry.90,91 Hydrogen recovery rates of 90–95% and hydrogen purity of 90–98% can be achieved.92 Recovery rates and purities depend on the composition of the gas mixture, the operating pressure and the temperature. The main drawback of cryogenic hydrogen distillation is that the low-temperature process requires a high amount of energy and several hours for start-up.10,93 Furthermore, freezable components (e.g. water < 1 ppm) must be separated beforehand. Higher hydrogen purity and higher recovery rate can be achieved with a combination of cryogenic distillation and downstream adsorption processes which further purifies the hydrogen at high pressure.93 For ultra-pure hydrogen production, ultra-fine purification of hydrogen with a capacity of 5–1000 m3 h−1 is offered, for example by Air Liquide, on a commercial scale. The amount of impurities (CH4, CO, CO2, O2) can be reduced from a few ppm to a few ppb.94


3.1.2 Absorption. 
Absorption processes for hydrogen purification are generally divided into physical and chemical absorption. The physical processes use the different solubilities of hydrogen and other components in a liquid for separation. Typically, undesired gas components dissolve better in the liquid compared to hydrogen which enables the purification process. Chemical processes use a chemical reaction between the impurities and the liquid absorbent. The impurities are chemically bound to the absorbent in an adsorption column under high pressure and/or low temperature. Later, in a regeneration column operating at lower pressure and/or higher temperature, the impurities are released to regenerate the absorbent. Thus, the absorbent circulates between the two columns. In applications where all gas components except hydrogen are to be dissolved, hydrogen leaves the system near the inlet pressure. The dissolved components, on the other hand, must be recompressed after separation. A physical absorption with organic solvents is used, for example, in hydrogen recovery units using as mixtures with high hydrocarbon content. Such a process delivers moderate product purities of 80–95% with a hydrogen recovery rate of 85–95%.95,96 Chemical absorption processes (e.g. amine scrubbing) are used to separate CO2 and typically provide a hydrogen purity and recovery rate of at least 95%.96


3.1.3 Adsorption. 
Gas separation by adsorption is based on the different adsorption behaviors of the substances present in the gas mixture (feed gas). Adsorption is understood as addition of molecules (the adsorptive) to a solid surface (adsorbent) to form an adsorbate.97 Activated carbon, carbon molecular sieves, zeolitic molecular sieves and silica gels are typical adsorbents in industrial gas cleaning applications.
A well-known method for the adsorptive purification of hydrogen is Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA).98,99 It can be described as a sequence of several process steps, which together form an adsorption cycle which is passed through repeatedly. The process steps are adsorption at high pressure (1.5–40 bar), desorption at low pressure, regeneration by purging the desorbed gas components, and finally repressurization for the next adsorption step. By interconnecting four to sixteen adsorbers, continuous gas production can be achieved in PSA plants.100 The number of adsorber beds and the adsorption pressure are determined by the purity of the feed gas and the required purity of the product gas. With pressure swing adsorption, hydrogen purity of up to 99.999% can be achieved.100Fig. 3 shows a PSA process with four adsorbers, in which hydrogen represents the hardly adsorbable component. While adsorption takes place in adsorber A, adsorber C is regenerated with a small portion of the product gas.
 Fig. 3  Hydrogen separation from a hydrogen-rich gas mixture by pressure swing adsorption with four adsorbers, adapted from Walter.100 
PSA plants are used from very low throughputs of 30 m3 per hour to an industrial scale with up to 400000 m3 per hour.101 The capital costs of a PSA plant are linearly dependent on the capacity, as the scale-up represents a numbering-up of adsorbers and the costly control valves. The same applies to the operating costs of PSA plants, which are determined primarily by the compression of the gas mixture. At very high throughputs, processes like distillation, extraction or absorption have an economic advantage over pressure swing adsorption due to their nonlinear dependence on capital cost.100 Industrial PSA plants for hydrogen purification are operated at a pressure level of 15–30 bar with typical recovery rates of 80–92%.49 The obtained purity depends on the feed gas quality and the off-gas pressure. An increase in off-gas pressure is associated with a significant drop in hydrogen purity. Against this background, the overpressure is limited to about 0.3–0.5 bar.
In addition to industrial-scale hydrogen purification, there is also extensive research into the development of compact PSA systems for fuel cell applications or on-site delivery of high purity hydrogen to service stations.102–106 These investigations include the development of new adsorbents, improvements in the adsorption cycle and innovative interconnections of the different adsorbers. Another interesting research direction is the development of adsorptive hydrogen purification systems from coke oven gas or other hydrogen-rich industrial exhaust gas streams.75,107 A selection of relevant scientific publications on the fine purification of hydrogen by pressure swing adsorption is given in Table 3. It turns out that in all studies high hydrogen purities have been achieved. A reduction in pressure or the number of adsorbers leads to a simplification of the system, but decreases the hydrogen recovery rate.8,97,100,101

3.1.4 Membrane separation. 
Membrane separation processes exploit the diffusion and solubility differences of gases, which are caused by the inherent properties of the membrane. Since 1979, membrane separation processes have been used in the production of ammonia for hydrogen recovery from the exhaust gases.111 Furthermore, there are applications for the separation of hydrogen from synthesis gas.49 Membrane separation processes offer high energy efficiency compared to pressure swing adsorption, a compact modular design and simple operation with comparatively low capital and operating costs.35,112 The principle of a single membrane unit, which is usually designed as a bundle of tubes in packs, is shown in Fig. 4 for the separation of hydrogen from a hydrogen-rich mixed gas.
 Fig. 4  Hydrogen separation from a hydrogen-rich gas mixture by membrane technology. 
Hydrogen purification has been extensively studied for the use of polymer membranes, microporous ceramic membranes, dense metallic membranes, proton-conductive membranes (PCMs), and carbon-based membranes. The most important parameters for hydrogen applications are permeability, selectivity, hydrogen flow per unit area and temperature.
According to the current knowledge, metallic and ceramic membranes are best suited for hydrogen separation. Metallic membranes are usually dense plates, which penetrate the hydrogen as protons and electrons. The metallic material must be able to conduct free electrons and the concept requires a catalytic surface to dissociate H2 at the feed side and to recombine H2 at the permeate side. Using palladium membranes, a hydrogen purity of up to 99.999% is possible.113 The hydrogen flow is proportional to the square root of the mixed gas inlet pressure. To counteract embrittlement of the material and poisoning of the membrane in contact with pollutants such as H2S or CO,9 Pd alloys (mainly Pd–Ag, Pd–Cu and Pd–X–Au) are used. Porous ceramic membranes, in contrast, are virtually inert to pollutants and their flow rate is proportional to the pressure of the mixed gas. The selectivity, however, is lower due to the separation of substances by molecular size compared to dense Pd membranes.114
Membrane reactors offer the possibility to circumvent thermodynamic limitations by integrating both the chemical reaction and the separation of substances in the same apparatus. Compared to the conventional configuration, in which the separation unit is connected downstream of the reactor, this offers the advantage of lower investment costs (due to the reduction of the size of the process unit), an improved yield, higher selectivity and a reduction of the downstream separation effort (due to the selective product separation from the reactor).114 Membrane reactors for the production of hydrogen have been used, for example, for the water-gas shift reaction,115,116 the steam reforming of methane and methanol,117,118 the gasification of coal,119 as well as the recycling of waste.114,120
Another possibility discussed in the literature is the combination of membranes and a PSA plant for the separation of hydrogen from syngas obtained by coal or biomass gasification. In the proposed sequence, the hydrogen is first separated by a membrane separation process from the hydrogen-rich mixed gas. The high pressure retentate is energetically used in a gas turbine or fed to a PSA plant for increasing the overall hydrogen yield.49 The reader interested in more details on the topic of membrane separation processes for hydrogen purification is referred to the more specialized literature.9,35,92,111,114,121,122


3.1.5 Electrochemical membranes. 
The use of electrochemical membranes is generally known in electrolyzers or fuel cells. There are, however, also applications for hydrogen compression and purification, known as Electrochemical Hydrogen Compression (EHC).123,124 In 1981, Sedlak et al.125 published studies in which hydrogen was brought electrochemically to a higher pressure level and simultaneously was separated from impurities such as CH4, CO2 and N2. Very good separation performance was achieved by Ibeh et al.126 from binary H2/CH4 mixtures. In these investigations pure hydrogen could be produced with a yield of up to 80%. The electrochemical hydrogen separation from a reformate gas was reported by Gardner and Ternan,127 Abdulla et al.128 and Bouwman.129 Using an electrochemical membrane, Bouwman129 was able to successfully separate hydrogen from a synthetic mixed gas (H2/CO2/CO/CH4 in the ratio 70:20:7.5:2.5). The hydrogen product was obtained with a remaining contamination of 188 ppm carbon dioxide and 14 ppm carbon monoxide. Abdulla et al.128 reported that a hydrogen recovery rate of at least 65% can be achieved for a single membrane and up to 98% for multi-staged systems. The European research project MEMPHYS is currently developing a hydrogen purification system to separate hydrogen electrochemically from various industrial sources (e.g., biomass fermentation or industrial waste gas streams).130 These research activities indicate that electrochemical membranes are a promising way to purify hydrogen. Sulfur compounds are considered problematic in this technology.
To conclude this part, Table 4 compares the most important state-of-the-art methods for the purification of hydrogen in terms of typical operating parameters, hydrogen purity and hydrogen recovery rate. Highly pure hydrogen can generally only be provided by adsorption and membrane separation processes. Each of the presented methods is characterized by a certain sensitivity against contaminants. The hydrogen recovery rate HRR in all processes is strongly coupled with the purity of the feed gas, the required product quality, and the capacity of the plant. In practice, combinations of the described technologies are also used for hydrogen cleaning applications.40,97,99

3.2 Hydrogen storage, transport and distribution
The technologies for storing hydrogen are usually categorized into physical storage, metal hydride storage, adsorptive storage and chemical storage. The conventional technologies for hydrogen logistics are compressed hydrogen and liquid hydrogen (physical hydrogen storage) as well as chemical hydrogen storage in the form of methane, methanol, ammonia or synthetic fuels. Metal hydrides as well as adsorptive storage technologies are intensively discussed in the academic literature, but are not yet state of the art in large scale industrial applications. Therefore, we will focus here on physical and chemical storage technologies to set the benchmark for the main topic of this review, hydrogen purification and storage using the LOHC technology. We will, in particular, focus here on the aspect whether the respective technology can store hydrogen-rich gas mixtures as we have seen above that all sources of green hydrogen represent gas mixtures in the first place.

3.2.1 Physical hydrogen storage. 
The physical hydrogen storage at high pressure (compressed hydrogen, CH2) or very low temperatures (liquid hydrogen, LH2) forms the basis of current hydrogen logistics and can be regarded as state of the art technologies. The hydrogen is stored at a pressure level of 200 bar in steel cylinders or up to 850 bar in fibre composite tanks.11,15,131,132 At room temperature and a pressure of 700 bar, hydrogen has a density of 37 kg H2 m−3, which corresponds to a volumetric energy density of 1233 kW h m−3.133 From a pressure of 350 bar on, the energy requirement for compression increases above proportion and also the material requirements regarding the applied pressure vessels become more sophisticated.133 The energy requirement for compressing hydrogen from atmospheric to 700 bar is 18 MJ kg−1, which corresponds to about 15% of the energy stored in the respective amount of hydrogen.132 In the field of mobility, pressurized hydrogen tanks are already state of the art at 350 (e.g. for trains and buses) and 700 bar (e.g. for cars), respectively. The current challenges are the development of low-cost carbon fibers, improved composite materials and conformal designs for mobile platforms as well as the reduction of system costs.134 There is no specific technological difference between compressing very pure hydrogen and compressing hydrogen-containing gas mixtures.
In addition to compression, the volumetric energy density of elemental hydrogen can be increased by liquefaction. For the liquefaction of gases, temperatures below the critical temperature of the gas must be reached. The critical temperature of elemental hydrogen is −240 °C.135 The process of hydrogen liquefaction was already developed at the end of the 19th century and first successfully realized by Sir James Dewar in 1898. He used carbon dioxide and liquid air to precool hydrogen at 180 bar prior to its expansion. The large-scale liquefaction of hydrogen requires a combination of heat exchangers and expansion turbines.132,136 Krasae-in et al.137 and Aasadnia et al.138 have provided a historical overview of the development of large-scale hydrogen liquefaction technology. According to their information, 29 plants with a capacity of 30–34000 kg H2 per day are in operation worldwide. At ambient pressure, liquid hydrogen has a temperature of −253 °C and an energy density of 70.8 kg H2 m−3.
Hydrogen liquefaction requires very high hydrogen quality as almost all gas impurities (helium being the exception) would solidify at temperatures higher than the liquefaction temperature of hydrogen and this would cause solid handling problems in the plant. A major disadvantage of hydrogen liquefaction is the very high energy requirement of the process, which corresponds to 28–46% of the energy stored in hydrogen. Furthermore, the sophisticated refrigeration process makes liquefaction of fluctuating streams of green hydrogen from wind- or solar-powered electrolysis a challenge.
The storage of liquid hydrogen requires active cooling and special materials to reduce losses due to evaporation effects. For the tank system, efficient multi-layer vacuum insulation is used.133 Depending on the size of the tank system, a daily hydrogen loss of 0.2–1% due to evaporation (the so-called ‘boil-off’) has been reported.12 Another critical aspect is hydrogen loss during filling processes which can be as high as 5% depending on the temperature of the tank to be filled.133,139 In the field of mobility, current development aspects for the application of liquid hydrogen are the improvement of insulation, the development of composite materials and further system and operation mode developments.134


3.2.2 Chemical hydrogen storage using N2 and CO2 as carrier molecules. 
The chemical storage of hydrogen by catalytic hydrogenation of N2 or CO2, often referred to as ‘Power-to-X technologies’, results in the production of ammonia (in the case of the carrier N2), or in the production of methane, methanol or synthetic hydrocarbons (in the case of the carrier CO2). These hydrogenation processes are tolerant against impurity in the hydrogen feed as long as the impurities do not act as catalyst poisons. In principle, all the named products can be split in a reverse reaction to obtain hydrogen again. The production of very pure hydrogen from these compounds, however, requires significant cleaning efforts. Due to this challenge in reversibility,140 the direct use of these products as fuels or building blocks for chemical production processes is preferred.141,142 In the following, we will shortly describe the characteristics of the different Power-to-X technologies to allow later on for a detailed comparison with the characteristics of the LOHC technologies.
The conversion of hydrogen into methane is attractive as this transformation allows handling of hydrogen in the existing infrastructure for natural gas. Note that addition of hydrogen gas into natural gas without conversion into methane is only possible to a very limited extent. In Germany, 5% is the upper limit of such blending. The methanization is realized by the Sabatier reaction (see eqn (13)), which was discovered already in 1902.143 CO2 + 4H2 ⇌ CH4 + 2H2O, ΔH0 = −165.0 kJ mol−1(13)
Methanization is a strongly exothermic catalytic reaction which takes place at a temperature of 250–500 °C and a pressure of up to 30 bar. Higher temperatures lead to faster reaction kinetics, but at the same time have a negative effect on the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reaction. Supported metals of the 8th subgroup (e.g. Ni, Ru, Fe, Co, Rh, Pt) are used as catalysts.144,145 A total of 128 Power-to-Gas projects (May 2018) have been realized in Europe on a research or demonstration scale.146 The currently largest plant for the production of synthetic natural gas with a connected load of 6 MWel was commissioned by Audi AG in Werlte (Germany) in 2013. The CO2 required for methanization is provided by a biogas treatment plant.147 The literature also describes the direct methanization of biogas with electrochemically produced hydrogen.148,149 Methane can be re-converted to hydrogen but such a process would require a sequence of methane reforming, water-gas-shift reaction, CO2 removal and fine purification by pressure-swing-absorption. The named sequence is identical to the efforts that are taken today when hydrogen is produced from natural gas. Note that the hydrogen storage capacity in methane is high. The gravimetric capacity is 25%, the LHV of the hydrogen bound to methane is 8.33 kW h kg−1 which compares to an LHV of 13.9 kW h kg−1 if methane is burned to CO2 and water.
While methane is a gaseous Power-to-X product, other approaches for CO2 hydrogenation with green hydrogen target liquid products to make use of the existing storage and transport facilities for liquid fuels. These approaches include the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to various alcohols and longer-chain hydrocarbons.141,142,150 Methanol has already been described by Olah et al.84 to provide an excellent way to combine the energy, mobility and industry sectors. The acute toxicity of methanol can be considered as the main disadvantage.12 Methanol has a gravimetric hydrogen capacity of 12.5%, the LHV of the hydrogen bound to methanol is 4.16 kW h kg−1 which compares to an LHV of 5.54 kW h kg−1 if methanol is burned to CO2 and water.
Methanol production by CO2 hydrogenation is carried out according to eqn (14). CO2 + 3H2 ⇌ CH3OH + H2O, ΔH0 = −49.8 kJ mol−1(14)
Using CO2 as the carbon source, the equilibrium of the reaction is not very favorable. Under typical operation conditions that allow for sufficient reaction rates (e.g. T = 250 °C; P = 75 bar; H2:CO2 = 3:1), the equilibrium CO2 conversion is below 25%.151 Process options to handle this limited equilibrium conversion in a continuous process include gas recycling with methanol condensation or absorption of the formed methanol and water in an appropriate solvent, e.g. an ionic liquid.152 Methanol represents a valuable feedstock material for the production of formaldehyde, formic acid, acetic acid and short-chain alkenes. In the mobility sector, methanol can be used as a fuel blending component or in the synthesis of biodiesel. Stationary energetic use of methanol can take place in combustion engines,153 gas turbines154,155 or direct methanol fuel cells.156–158 Methanol can be re-converted to hydrogen in the so-called ‘methanol steam reforming’ process.159 This process produces a mixture of CO2 and hydrogen in a ratio close to 1:3 together with relevant amounts of CO (depending on the reaction temperature).160 Again, the operational efforts to convert methanol back into pure hydrogen are significant. For this reason almost all power-to-methanol demonstration projects suggest the use of methanol as a chemical building block or fuel component. Re-conversion to pure hydrogen is typically not considered.
In addition to methanol production, the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to synthetic fuels using the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis is an interesting hydrogen storage option. The key advantage of this pathway is that traditional fuels are produced and thus fuel logistics and the established engine technologies can be applied without any modifications. The Fischer–Tropsch process, which has been known since the 1920s, traditionally converts hydrogen and carbon monoxide into a hydrocarbon product mixture containing alkanes and alkenes of a certain chain length distribution (depending on the catalyst, temperature and pressure). This mixture can then be processed into chemical building blocks, synthetic diesel, synthetic gasoline or synthetic kerosene. More relevant for hydrogen storage in the context of a future green economy is, however, the hydrogenation of CO2. Typically, CO2 is first reduced to CO via a reversible water-gas shift step using, e.g., hydrogen generated by an electrolyzer. In recent years, there have been some demonstration projects for Fischer–Tropsch-like CO2 hydrogenation processes. In particular, Audi AG undertook efforts to produce so-called e-fuels in this way. In cooperation with Sunfire GmbH, a pilot plant for the production of synthetic diesel was inaugurated in 2015.161 Furthermore, Audi AG announced a further project for the production of synthetic diesel at the end of 2017. In cooperation with Ineratec and Energiedienst Holding, a pilot plant with an annual capacity of 400000 L is to be built in Laufenburg, Switzerland.162,163 In Norway, Nordic Blue Crude, Sunfire GmbH and other partners are planning the production of synthetic petroleum substitutes with an annual capacity of 8000 t and an electrical connected load of 20 MWel from 2020 onwards.164 It is rather effortful to reconvert Fischer–Tropsch products into pure hydrogen. The process sequence would involve partial oxidation or reforming of the hydrocarbon mixture followed by recycling and gas purification steps. Considering a diesel fraction as a typical Fischer–Tropsch product mixture, the nominal gravimetric hydrogen capacity is about 15.5% (e.g. taking n-decane as the model compound). The LHV of the hydrogen bound to Fischer–Tropsch diesel is 5.16 kW h kg−1 which compares to an LHV of 11.90 kW h kg−1 if diesel is burned to CO2 and water.
Ammonia is an interesting alternative for the carbon-free transport and storage of hydrogen.165,166 At present, ammonia is mainly used in fertilizer production. The synthesis is carried out at industrial scale using the Haber–Bosch process according to eqn (15) with an iron-containing catalyst at 150–350 bar and 400–500 °C.1,167 N2 + 3H2 ⇌ 2NH3, ΔH0 = −92.3 kJ mol−1(15)
With a global ammonia production capacity of 144 million tons per year (2016),168, it is estimated that about 50% of the hydrogen produced worldwide ends up in ammonia. While ammonia synthesis is technically very mature, it is important to state that the conversion per reactor pass is far from quantitative. Thus, costly product condensation and gas recycle/gas recompression steps are required. Ammonia production is therefore typically performed in very large plants and in strictly stationary operation mode. Traditional ammonia synthesis based on the fluctuating input of green hydrogen from renewable electricity is a challenge. As an alternative option for the future, the literature also describes the direct electrochemical synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and water.169–172
The advantages of ammonia-based hydrogen storage are the high hydrogen density of 17.6 wt% and the simple catalytic decomposition to nitrogen/hydrogen gas mixtures. The LHV of the hydrogen bound to ammonia is 5.88 kW h kg−1. The ammonia decomposition process requires temperatures of about 300 °C.173 Compared to hydrogen storage in the form of hydrocarbons and alcohols, there are no CO2 emissions involved in the ammonia hydrogen storage cycle. Ammonia is thermodynamically stable and can be stored and transported at low pressures (below 8 bar) in stainless steel or coated aluminium tanks.174 The main challenges for establishing ammonia as a large scale hydrogen vector are its toxicity and the N2/H2 gas mixture obtained in the NH3 decomposition. To produce pure hydrogen from ammonia, additional separation efforts are required. A direct ammonia fuel cell would therefore be highly attractive but this technology is currently still in the early stages of development.175
To conclude this section, Table 5 shows an overview of the most relevant state-of-the-art hydrogen storage technologies. The data indicate typical storage conditions, energy densities and the reversibility of the listed storage technologies.

4 Hydrogen logistics using LOHC systems
While in the past, the majority of hydrogen was produced at the location of its industrial consumption, the fully defossilized energy system in the future will regard hydrogen as a key energy vector and effective hydrogen logistics will play a key role in connecting high-energy sites for the production of green hydrogen with centers of energy and hydrogen consumption.
In this context, a number of guidelines, roadmaps and reports have been developed that specify requirements for future hydrogen logistics systems. The European Association for Storage of Energy and the European Energy Research Alliance have recommended a volumetric hydrogen storage density of 17–40 kg H2 m−3 and a gravimetric hydrogen storage density of 3.0–7.0% by weight.176 According to specifications by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), hydrogen storage systems for the transport sector in America should have a volumetric hydrogen storage density of 30 kg H2 m−3 and a gravimetric hydrogen storage density of 4.5% by weight from 2020. In the long term, the DOE aims to achieve storage densities of 50 kg H2 m−3 and 6.5% by weight.177 This long-term target corresponds to a volumetric energy density of 1.67 MW h m−3. Competitive hydrogen logistics systems should also meet the following criteria:18,140
(a) low system costs,
(b) effective hydrogen uptake and release under technically reasonable conditions,
(c) excellent reversibility of the hydrogen storage system,
(d) low losses during storage and transport,
(e) low effort for integration into the existing infrastructure,
(f) availability of hydrogen storage materials on low cost and technical scale,
(g) high thermal and chemical stability of the hydrogen storage materials,
(h) high environmental compatibility of the hydrogen storage materials, and
(i) high safety of the entire storage and transport system.
One way to transport and store hydrogen under ambient conditions with excellent reversibility that has attracted great attention in the last decade is the use of Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC) systems.14–16,31,178,179 LOHC systems consist of pairs of low melting organic compounds that can bind and release hydrogen in highly reversible catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. The hydrogen-lean LOHC compound is charged by catalytic hydrogenation to form the hydrogen-rich LOHC compound. The hydrogen release step is a catalytic dehydrogenation that converts the hydrogen-rich compound into the hydrogen-lean counterpart. The carrier molecule is used many times and acts like a liquid storage container for the chemically bound hydrogen. Fig. 5 exemplifies the LOHC-based hydrogen storage concept for the system dibenzyltoluene (H0-DBT)/perhydro-dibenzyltoluene (H18-DBT).
 Fig. 5  Reversible hydrogen storage with liquid organic hydrogen carriers using the example of the LOHC system dibenzyltoluene/perhydro-dibenzyltoluene. 
LOHC systems are characterized by a high hydrogen storage density, typically in the range of 5.7–7.3 wt% or 50–60 kg H2 m−3, respectively.14–16,178 For the specific example shown in Fig. 5, the gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity is 6.23 mass%, the volumetric storage capacity is 56.6 g H2 per L or 1.88 MW h m−3. The hydrogen is stored in a chemically bound form under ambient conditions, the storage container can be a simple steel or plastic tank.
Hydrogenation of the hydrogen-lean LOHC compound is always an exothermal reaction, such as the hydrogenation of CO2 or N2 in the other chemical hydrogen storage concepts (see above). For the reverse reaction, the hydrogen release by dehydrogenation, the same amount of heat has to be supplied to the system. In the case of the LOHC system H0-DBT/H18-DBT, the released/required amount of heat is 65.4 kJ mol−1 of hydrogen under standard conditions, which corresponds to around 27% of the LHV of the chemically bound hydrogen.180 Note that a significant heat of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation is an important safety feature of LOHC systems. A much lower heat of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation would have as a consequence the incidental release of stored hydrogen, e.g. if a tank containing hydrogen-rich LOHC compounds warms up in the sunshine in the presence of a catalytically active metal. Such incidental hydrogen release from a hydrogen storage system would be highly undesired.
The rate of hydrogen storage in and hydrogen release from LOHC systems is controlled by the applied catalyst and by the reactor's ability to transfer the reaction heat from or to the catalytic sites of the system. The maximum achievable quantity of hydrogen storage or hydrogen release is controlled by thermodynamics and defined by the respective reaction conditions. This is illustrated for the specific example of the H0-DBT/H18-DBT LOHC system in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Equilibrium conversion for the hydrogenation of H0-DBT and the dehydrogenation of H18-DBT as a function of pressure and temperature. Adapted from Jorschick et al.28,181. 
At a temperature of 310 °C, the hydrogen pressure required to allow full conversion of H0-DBT into H18-DBT needs to be above 8 bar. The same temperature allows for a full release of hydrogen at a hydrogen partial pressure of 2.5 bar. Full release of hydrogen at even higher hydrogen partial pressure would require even higher reaction temperatures combined with fast kinetics (due to the exponential temperature dependency of the reaction rate) but with the risk of higher LOHC degradation and the need for a heat source that provides heat at an even higher temperature. In contrast, at 290 °C a hydrogen partial pressure of 6 bar is sufficient to allow full LOHC loading towards H18-DBT. At this lower temperature, however, the hydrogen partial pressure has to be reduced to 1.5 bar to enable full hydrogen release from the LOHC system.
After the dehydrogenation reactor, a hydrogen cleaning step removes evaporated parts of the LOHC system by condensation. Depending on the LOHC system, the reaction conditions during dehydrogenation and the applied catalyst, hydrogen is obtained in this way with a purity of 99.9% (quality 3.0) or higher.20 In the case of hydrogen production from H18-DBT the obtained raw hydrogen quality after simple condensation of LOHC components is typically higher than 99.98% (quality 3.8).
Compared to other chemical hydrogen storage systems, the LOHC technology is characterized by an excellent reversibility, i.e. it is very simple to obtain high purity hydrogen from the storage medium in the hydrogen release reaction. Note in this context that hydrogen release from methanol or ammonia produces gas mixtures. Compared to physical hydrogen storage systems, the simple and safe liquid logistics under ambient conditions represents a striking advantage. Pure hydrocarbon LOHC systems (such as, e.g., H0-DBT/H18-DBT) are characterized by excellent compatibility with sealings and other construction materials applied in traditional fuel logistics. This enables efficient transport and storage in the available infrastructure for crude oil, fuel and diesel using existing tank ships, tank farms, tank trailers, and filling stations.14,182
In order to provide the heat input required for hydrogen release, clever ways of heat integration can be applied in the respective application system. If the released hydrogen is used for producing electricity (e.g. on board of a vehicle), a fuel cell operating at a temperature higher than the dehydrogenation temperature can provide the needed heat for hydrogen release.183,184 Alternatively, a direct LOHC fuel cell concept may be used.185 In cases where hydrogen is the desired product, the process is typically placed close to the hydrogen consumer (e.g. a hydrogen filling station or an industrial site with hydrogen need) and ideally the selected location does also provide process heat or a chance to generate heat other than from hydrogen burning or direct electrical heating.
In the following, our review will focus on the catalytic hydrogenation of the most relevant LOHC systems considered to date. This reaction represents the charging step of the LOHC-based hydrogen storage system. The reader interested in more details on the catalytic dehydrogenation of LOHC systems (the hydrogen release step) can refer to a number of recent excellent reviews covering this step of the LOHC-based storage cycle in great detail.14,15,22,186 We will first discuss the hydrogenation of LOHC compounds with pure hydrogen (Chapter 5). This will provide the base for discussing subsequently the direct charging of LOHC systems using green hydrogen-rich gas mixtures. The direct use of gas mixtures saves the cost for hydrogen purification and creates attractive options for integrating LOHC-based hydrogen storage into traditional process chains that initially produce hydrogen-rich product streams. In this way the hydrogen from such mixtures can be valorized in a very attractive manner.
5 Hydrogenation of LOHC systems with pure hydrogen
5.1 The LOHC system toluene/methylcyclohexane
The structurally simplest aromatic substances for reversible hydrogen storage are benzene and toluene. A concept for reversible hydrogen storage based on the toluene/methylcyclohexane (MCH) system (see Fig. 7) was already proposed in 1975 by Sultan and Shaw187 and in 1983 and 1985 by Taube et al.188,189 Seasonal hydrogen storage using this system was suggested by Newson et al.21 MCH offers a gravimetric storage density of 6.1 wt% and a volumetric storage density of 47 kgH2 m−3. The specific reaction enthalpy for hydrogen release is 68.3 kJ mol−1.190
 Fig. 7  Hydrogen storage using the LOHC system toluene/methylcyclohexane. 
The big advantage of this LOHC system is the great technical availability of all components and their proven compatibility with the fuel infrastructure. Note that toluene and cyclic C7 alkanes make a significant part of our today's Otto fuel. Drawbacks linked to the toluene/MCH LOHC system are their low density, low boiling points (toluene: 110 °C or MCH: 111 °C) and low flash points (toluene: 6 °C or MCH: −4 °C). While the first aspect reduces the volumetric hydrogen capacity, the latter two points increase safety hazards and lead to more technical efforts for the safe handling of this LOHC system in the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes. Furthermore, the toxicological profile of toluene is not ideal. Inhaling more than 2000 ppm toluene can lead to severe lung damage.191
Despite these challenges, the Japanese company Chiyoda is working intensively on the implementation of a large-scale hydrogen supply with the toluene/MCH system. A 50 m3 h−1 hydrogen storage demonstration plant was commissioned in 2013.24,25 The four Japanese companies Chiyoda, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha recently founded the Advanced Hydrogen Energy Chain Association for Technology Development (AHEAD) and aim to implement the world's first global demonstration project for hydrogen supply with LOHC. Hydrogen loading will take place in Brunei Darussalam and hydrogen release in the Japanese coastal region of Kawasaki. The project partners plan to be able to supply 210 t of hydrogen by 2020.26 Comprehensive techno-economic studies192,193 have demonstrated that the toluene/MCH LOHC system can be used economically compared to conventional hydrogen storage technologies.
The hydrogenation of toluene with heterogeneous catalysts has been intensively investigated in the past. Table 6 summarizes a selection of pioneering studies from the literature.

Mechanistic investigations on the catalytic hydrogenation of aromatic compounds go back to the 19th century and were summarized by Sabatier and Reid in 1923.194 During this time, the research on the hydrogenation of aromatic compounds focused on the use of nickel catalysts, but catalysts based on cobalt, iron, copper, platinum and palladium were also considered. In 1912, Zelinsky212 reported that Pt and Pd catalysts can also be used very efficiently for the hydrogenation of toluene and other aromatic compounds. In the 1940s, Smith et al.196,198–200,213 reported comprehensively on the reaction kinetics of toluene and several dozen substituted benzene compounds using a Pt catalyst. The investigations by Rader et al.201 aimed later at determining the adsorption strength of toluene on the Pt catalyst in comparison to other aromatic compounds. It was found that the relative adsorption strength for the different organic compounds does not correlate unambiguously with the activity during their hydrogenation. It was assumed that the relative adsorption strength is rather determined by the steric hindrance during the adsorption of the benzene ring on the catalyst surface. In later investigations with Pt and Pd catalysts,263,264 it was generally found that the hydrogenation rate decreases with the number and position of the substituents. Also with Ni catalysts, it was found that the activity decreases with increasing alkylation at the aromatic compound.214 In 1983, Orozco & Webb203 published a study comparing the hydrogenation of toluene with Pt and Pd catalysts supported on alumina and silica. They concluded that the Pt catalyst enabled higher specific activity compared to the Pd catalyst. Other groups demonstrated that the hydrogenation of aromatic compounds on Pt and Pd catalysts involves the same sequential binding of dissociatively adsorbed hydrogen atoms to the associatively adsorbed aromatic compound.208,215,216 The binding of the first hydrogen atom, the step in which the molecule loses its aromatic nature, represents the rate-determining step of the reaction. It is assumed that there is no competing adsorption of hydrogen and aromatic components. Also Rh has been considered as an active metal for toluene hydrogenation. Ali et al.209 compared alumina supported Pt, Ir, Rh-, and Re-catalysts in the hydrogenation of toluene in a wide temperature range of 50 to 250 °C. Up to a reaction temperature of 170 °C the sequence of hydrogenation activity was Rh > Pt > Ir > Re > U. At temperatures above 170 °C the activity of the Rh catalyst was shown to decrease strongly and Pt is the most active metal under these high temperature conditions.
5.2 The LOHC systems benzyltoluene/perhydro benzyltoluene and dibenzyltoluene/perhydro dibenzyltoluene
In 2014, Brückner et al.17 proposed the use of benzyltoluene and dibenzyltoluene as hydrogen-lean compounds of promising LOHC systems. These compounds are produced as mixtures of regioisomers at a large industrial scale and have been widely used as heat transfer oils since the 1960s. Typical trade names are Marlotherm, Farolin or Diphyl. In addition to their excellent technical availability in constant quality and at low cost (2–4€ per kg depending on the ordered quantity and purity), these materials are characterized by a large liquid range (mp < −30 °C, bp > 260 °C), high hydrogen storage capacity and excellent thermal stability up to 350 °C. The fact that these liquids are in technical use for more than five decades indicates that many application-relevant data on safety, thermophysical properties, material compatibilities and ecotoxicity are well documented.180,217–220Fig. 8 shows the hydrogen storage cycle involving the benzyltoluene (H0-BT)/perhydrobenzyltoluene (H12-BT) and the dibenzyltoluene (H0-DBT)/perhydrodibenzyltoluene (H18-DBT) LOHC system, respectively.

The enthalpy of hydrogenation under standard conditions is 63.5 kJ mol−1 H2 for H0-BT and 65.4 kJ mol−1 H2 for H0-DBT. The volumetric hydrogen storage density is 56 kgH2 m−3 for H12-BT and 58 kgH2 m−3 for H18-DBT. Further application relevant properties of these two LOHC systems are summarized in Table 7.

Hydrogenation of H0-DBT with Ni catalysts




The first investigations reported by Brückner et al.17,223 identified Ru and Pd catalysts on carbon and alumina supports as suitable H0-DBT hydrogenation catalysts. Under the applied conditions (batch, 0.1 mol H0-BT or H0-DBT in 150 ml of cyclohexane, 100 °C, 10 bar H2 pressure) the hydrogenation activity decreased in the following order: Ru/Al2O3 ≥ Ru/C > Pd/C > Pd/Al2O3. At the beginning of the reaction, a certain lag phase was observed before the catalyst reached its full activity. This activation behavior was attributed to an in situ catalyst reduction and can be avoided by a catalyst pre-reduction protocol.
With the most catalytically active catalyst system (Ru/Al2O3), the reaction parameters were optimized and full conversion of H0-BT and H0-DBT was achieved within 120 min reaction time using 1.0 mol% Ru at 100 °C and 30 bar hydrogen. Furthermore, Brückner223 studied the reaction mechanism of the hydrogenation of benzyltoluene and showed that the hydrogenation of H0-BT proceeds via the intermediates H4-BT, H6-BT and H10-BT to the fully hydrogenated product H12-BT (see Fig. 9).
 Fig. 9  Reaction mechanism of the hydrogenation of benzyltoluene. Adapted from Brückner.223 
Later on, Leinweber et al.229 demonstrated that H0-BT hydrogenation starts preferably at the non-methylated ring. Among the three H0-BT isomers, para-benzyltoluene was found to hydrogenate fastest while the technical H0-BT isomer mixture showed a slower hydrogen up-take compared to any of the pure H0-BT isomers.
The reaction path for the hydrogenation of H0-DBT was investigated in detail by Do et al. under solventless reaction conditions (0.25 mol% Ru based on H0-DBT, 120–200 °C, 50 bar H2 pressure).224 The applied combination of 1H-NMR, HPLC and GC-MS enabled statements about the sequence of hydrogenation and the authors concluded that hydrogenation of H18-DBT proceeds via reaction steps 1, 3 and 6 as shown in Fig. 10. The strong side ring preference makes the hydrogenation of the central phenyl ring the rate determining reaction step. The subsequent studies by Müller et al.4,225 demonstrated that H0-DBT hydrogenation with Ru/Al2O3 catalyst under solvent-free conditions shows a linear dependence of hydrogen uptake on hydrogen pressure. The same study was transferred the H0-DBT hydrogenation to continuous operation mode using a trickle bed reactor. The effects of the LOHC volume flow, hydrogen pressure and reaction temperature on the productivity of the H18-DBT hydrogenation was examined.
 Fig. 10  Reaction mechanism of the hydrogenation of dibenzyltoluene, adapted from Do et al.224 
For H0-DBT hydrogenation at temperatures above 200 °C, Pt on alumina has been identified as a very suitable catalyst.226 Such elevated hydrogenation temperatures are beneficial to extract the heat of hydrogenation at the highest possible level from the reactor and to realize fast kinetics for a power-dense storage process. Table 9 compares the H0-DBT hydrogenation performance at elevated temperatures for Ru-, Pt-, Rh- and Pd-catalysts on alumina with respect to the formation of by-products. CO2 originates from traces of water in the LOHC or catalyst support, methane is formed by hydrogenolytic LOHC decomposition reactions.

It was found that Ru and Rh are very well suited for H0-DBT hydrogenation below 200 °C. With these catalysts, however, higher reaction temperatures do not lead to a rise in activity, but rather to increased by-product formation, especially with ruthenium. In contrast, Pd and Pt on alumina show very good H0-DBT hydrogenation activities with only small by-product formation up to hydrogenation temperatures of 260 °C. The use of Pt catalysts shows the best combination of excellent hydrogenation activity (>10 gH2/(gPt min) at 260 °C and 30 bar H2) and low by-product formation above 200 °C. All four catalysts showed stable activity over up to five consecutive hydrogenations with no enrichment of high-boiling by-products detected by GC-MS analysis in the LOHC product.31,226
The conventional LOHC-based hydrogen storage process involves separate hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactors operating at low temperature/high pressure in the case of hydrogenation and high temperature/low pressure in the case of dehydrogenation to maximize thermodynamic driving forces for the respective steps.21,24,233 Such a set-up, however, limits the flexibility of large stationary storage processes as extended heating times are necessary to bring the respective reactor from stand-by conditions to operation conditions while switching from storage to release mode and vice versa.
In 2017, Jorschick et al.28 demonstrated that stationary hydrogen storage in LOHC systems works most effectively if one single reactor is applied for both LOHC hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. Key to this development was the finding that Pt on alumina catalysts allow effective LOHC hydrogenation and dehydrogenation at temperatures above 220 °C. This so-called OneReactor LOHC technology (see Fig. 11) brings the advantage of a much simpler storage unit layout and offers high dynamics in switching from hydrogen charging to hydrogen release (within seconds by just adjusting the pressure level in the reactor). Moreover, by conducting both reactions at the same temperature level using solely a change in hydrogen partial pressure to switch between charging and discharging mode, heat integration between the storage and the discharge reaction is possible.
 Fig. 11  Scheme of the one-reactor concept for stationary hydrogen storage applications. 
In a subsequent study, the same group demonstrated 13 hydrogenation/dehydrogenation cycles with the same LOHC batch over a total of 405 h of operation including two long dehydrogenation sequences over weekends.181 In general, longer dehydrogenation runs, i.e. exposure of the LOHC to catalyst at low hydrogen pressure and elevated temperatures (>280 °C), showed negative effects on both activity of the subsequent cycles and by-product formation. Concerning catalyst activity and hydrogen productivity, stable productivity was achieved (within 3 to 9 cycles) under all conditions tested. Longer hydrogenation runs led to significantly higher stability of the reaction system.181 The same concept was also recently demonstrated by Shi et al.227
Concluding this part on the hydrogenation of benzyltoluene and dibenzyltoluene, one can state that Ru-based catalysts work best for reaction temperatures below 200 °C, while Pt-based catalysts offer the chance to perform fast and very selective hydrogenation of aromatics up to temperatures of 320 °C.4,28,226 While low temperature hydrogen charging promises a faster start-up procedure of the respective hydrogen storage plant from stand-by, hydrogenation at temperatures above 300 °C offers the chance to extract the hydrogenation heat in the form of process steam at a very attractive temperature level for further energetic use and opens options for heat integration between the hydrogen charging and decharging process through suitable thermal storage systems, e.g. a molten salt-based heat storage system.
Our analysis of the existing literature shows that more studies to date have studied the hydrogenation of dibenzyltoluene compared to benzyltoluene. Both systems are available in technical quantities, constant quality and at low cost. Both are characterized by a high storage capacity, excellent reversibility and high thermal stability up to 350 °C. The main advantage of the H0-DBT/H18-DBT system is the high boiling points of all LOHC components that enable very good separation of the hydrogen from the organic phase after dehydrogenation.228 The main disadvantage of the H0-DBT/H18-DBT system is the high viscosity of the H18-DBT at low temperatures (i.e. 389 mPa s at 20 °C).231 Recently, it was suggested to use mixtures of benzyltoluene- and dibenzyltoluene-based LOHC systems to combine the advantages of the two.231 This mixing provides the advantage of a reduced viscosity of the hydrogen-rich system, for example a 20 wt% addition of H12-BT to H18-DBT reduces the viscosity at 10 °C by 80%.
5.3 The LOHC system N-ethylcarbazole/perhydro N-ethyl carbazole
The use of nitrogen-containing aromatics as hydrogen carrier molecules is interesting because the introduction of this heteroatom into the aromatic structure allows for lowering the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation enthalpy. As a favourable consequence, this leads to more suitable thermodynamics for complete hydrogen release from the charged LOHC compound at low temperatures. Thus, the temperature of the endothermal dehydrogenation step can be lowered compared to heteroatom-free alicyclic compounds18,234,235 which facilitates heat integration with external heat sources and with waste heat generated during the energetic use of the released hydrogen.
The most well-known nitrogen-containing LOHC systems are based on carbazole and its alkylated derivatives. These materials have a hydrogen storage capacity of 4–6 wt% and allow hydrogen release at temperatures down to 150 °C.186Fig. 12 illustrates the respective hydrogen storage cycle for the example of the N-ethylcarbazole (H0-NEC)/perhydro-N-ethylcarbazole (H12-NEC) system. The hydrogen loading of N-ethylcarbazole236–242 and the hydrogen release from perhydro-N-ethylcarbazole225,242–251 have been studied in many scientific papers.
 Fig. 12  Simplified reaction scheme of the reversible hydrogen storage with the LOHC system N-ethylcarbazole (H0-NEC)/perhydro-N-ethylcarbazole (H12-NEC). 
While the reduction of dehydrogenation temperatures is a significant advantage, the presence of nitrogen in the LOHC compounds comes with a number of consequences that are less favourable for the large-scale technical use of such LOHC systems: (i) the C–N-bond is thermally less stable than the C–C-bond leading to a lower thermal robustness of carbazole LOHC systems compared to, e.g. the corresponding fluorene LOHC systems; (ii) the melting points of nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic compounds are typically quite high, e.g. 247 °C for carbazole, 88 °C for N-methylcarbazole, and 68 °C for N-ethylcarbazole.252 Most carbazoles are solids under ambient conditions, which leads to major practical challenges in LOHC transport and distribution; (iii) N-containing aromatic compounds are typically not present in today's fuel; thus, the compatibility of N-alkyl carbazoles with existing fuel infrastructure (e.g. with sealing materials) is questionable; (iv) the technical availability of N-alkyl carbazoles is quite limited with an annual production of less than 10000 tons; (v) N-containing heteroaromatic compounds are characterized by a number of ecotoxicological aspects that are more problematic for their large scale industrial implementation compared to pure hydrocarbon LOHC systems.207
Reversible hydrogen storage with N-alkyl carbazoles and their perhydro counterparts has been pioneered by researchers from Air Products and Chemicals.253–255 A selection of the subsequent studies on the catalytic hydrogenation of N-ethylcarbazole (H0-NEC) and related work is shown in Table 10.

Due to the solid state of the hydrogen-lean heteroaromatic compounds at room temperature, most experimental investigations were carried out in solvents. Sotoodeh et al.245,256 studied the hydrogenation of H0-NEC with a Ru/Al2O3 catalyst in decalin. These authors described the hydrogenation at 130–150 °C at a hydrogen pressure of 70 bar as a first order reaction in H0-NEC and proposed the hydrogenation network shown in Fig. 13. For comparison, carbazole was also hydrogenated under the same reaction conditions. The selectivity towards the fully hydrogenated product was also very high, but the reaction rates were much lower compared to N-ethylcarbazole hydrogenation. The lower reaction rate with carbazole was attributed to the strong interaction of the free electron pair at the nitrogen atom with the active catalytic sites. These deactivating interactions are reduced in the hydrogenation of H0-NEC due to the steric effect caused by the N-ethyl group.256

Ye et al.236 evaluated a RANEY® Ni catalyst for the hydrogenation of H0-NEC in the temperature range of 120 to 240 °C using a hydrogen pressure of 50 bar. They concluded from their results that the reaction follows a first-order kinetics in H0-NEC with an apparent Arrhenius activation energy of 65 kJ mol−1. Mass transfer limitations were excluded by these authors. Wan et al.240,241 reported for their H0-NEC hydrogenation studies with Ru/Al2O3 catalyst at reaction temperatures of 120 to 160 °C and a hydrogen pressure of 60 bar an activation energy of only 31 kJ mol−1. As a reason for this lower activation energy value, limitation by pore diffusion cannot be excluded.
In investigations by Eblagon et al.,237,238 Ru, Pt, Pd and Ni on activated carbon catalysts were compared in the hydrogenation of H0-NEC at 130 °C and 70 bar hydrogen pressure. The following sequence of decreasing catalytic activity was observed: Ru > Pd > Pt > Ni. A variation of the support material showed that the highest activity and selectivity is observed with the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst. In further investigations, the hydrogenation of H0-NEC catalysed by unsupported precious metal powders was investigated.257 At a temperature of 130 °C and a hydrogen pressure of 70 bar, ruthenium powder showed very high activity, but H8-NEC was found to be a relatively stable intermediate. The use of palladium powder, in contrast, resulted in the formation of significant amounts of H4-NEC as a stable intermediate. The use of platinum powder resulted in the isomerization of the fully hydrogenated product.257
In another publication, Eblagon et al.239 reported the catalytic activity of Rh, Ru and Pd catalysts for H0-NEC hydrogenation using various catalyst supports. The authors concluded that the adsorption of the H0-NEC at the precious metal catalyst represents the rate-determining step of hydrogenation and that this step is barely influenced by the support material.239 It should be noted that, in addition to experimental studies, theoretical studies on the reaction mechanism of H0-NEC hydrogenation can be found in the literature.259
Studies on the catalytic hydrogenation of N-propyl carbazoles were presented by Yang et al.258 These authors used a Ru/Al2O3 catalyst in the temperature range of 120 to 150 °C and determined an apparent Arrhenius activation energy of 18 kJ mol−1. The investigations of ternary mixtures of H0-NEC, N-propylcarbazole and N-butylcarbazole by Müller225 came to the conclusion that the influence of the alkyl chain length on the hydrogenation performance is negligible. In this study, however, a significant reduction of the melting point to 13 °C (compared to the melting point of pure N-ethylcarbazole at 68 °C) was observed for the ternary mixture under investigation and this was considered a relevant advantage for the technical application of such an LOHC system.252
Despite these practically relevant developments, it is fair to state that N-containing LOHC systems are characterized by a number of relevant shortcomings that currently prevent their large scale technical application. That includes the thermal instability of the nitrogen–carbon bond, the lack of technical availability in constant quality, problematic ecotoxicological aspects, and – most important – compatibility issues with the current fuel infrastructure.14
6 Hydrogenation of LOHC compounds using hydrogen-rich gas mixtures
Charging hydrogen-lean LOHC compounds with hydrogen-rich gas mixtures instead of pure hydrogen is highly interesting for economic reasons. Hydrogen as part of a gas mixture is much cheaper than hydrogen at the typical qualities of 99% (quality 2.0) to 99.999% (quality 5.0) purity. By direct use of hydrogen-rich gas mixtures in the LOHC charging process, significant hydrogen purification efforts, e.g. to separate hydrogen from CH4, H2O, CO or CO2, can be saved. The typical purification processes, such as absorption in amine solutions, washing with liquid nitrogen or pressure swing adsorption processes, have been described above and are related to significant investment and operation cost.
Simultaneous hydrogen storage and hydrogen purification by such a Mixed Gas Hydrogenation (MGH) of LOHC compounds is possible and technically attractive if four prerequisites are fulfilled:
• None of the components present in the hydrogen-rich gas mixture should act as a catalyst poison;
• No other component of the gas mixture than hydrogen should react with the hydrogen-lean LOHC compound;
• The applied catalyst should not catalyze any hydrogen-consuming reaction of gas components and hydrogen that would reduce the efficiency of the hydrogen storage process; possible side reactions of the LOHC hydrogenation in the presence of methane, CO, and CO2 are shown in Table 11;
• Once the LOHC system has been charged with the hydrogen-rich gas mixture all physically dissolved gas impurities must be carefully removed, e.g. by evacuation; otherwise these dissolved impurities would reduce the hydrogen quality produced from the LOHC system in the hydrogen release step.
If these points are met, the hydrogenation of LOHC compounds with hydrogen-rich gas mixtures enables the utilization of low-value hydrogen streams for high-value applications such as hydrogen delivery to hydrogen filling stations which is economically highly attractive.

Note that the hydrogenation of the typical impurity CO2 with precious metal catalysts can not only produce methane (with undesired consumption of hydrogen) but also CO in a reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. CO is known as a potent catalyst poison for many supported precious metal catalysts.
In the following, we will discuss step-by-step the influence of various components of binary gas mixtures in the LOHC hydrogenation reactions. All components discussed are typical impurities of industrial, hydrogen-rich gas mixtures.
6.1 Hydrogenation of hydrocarbon LOHC compounds in the presence of water
The effect of water on the hydrogenation of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds has so far only been considered by a few working groups. According to Bartholomew,260 the presence of water in the reaction system may lead to wetting of the catalyst, acceleration of sintering processes and agglomeration of powder catalysts, resulting in deactivation of the catalyst. In the literature, several reports discuss the partial hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene in a four-phase reaction system containing water.261–263 Struijk et al.261,262 described in this context the formation of a benzene-rich water layer around the applied Ru catalyst, which promotes desorption of cyclohexene and thus suppresses the complete hydrogenation to cyclohexane. In order to achieve a high selectivity to partially hydrogenated cyclohexene, up to 50% water was added to the reaction mixture. In the catalytic hydrogenation of α-methylstyrene with Pd/Al2O3, the presence of water (already below 100 ppm) has been shown to lead to a significant decrease in reaction rate.264
The effect of water on the hydrogenation of the LOHC compound dibenzyltoluene was investigated by Jorschick et al.31,226 using alumina-supported Ru, Rh, Pt and Pd catalysts. With powdered catalysts in batch mode operation, the presence of water led to a slight decrease in the reaction rate for all catalysts except ruthenium, see Table 12. Furthermore, an increase of methane in the gas phase after the reaction could be observed in the presence of water.

Additional studies with catalyst pellets confirmed that H0-DBT can be readily and fully hydrogenated even in the presence of a large excess of water, i.e. using a water-saturated LOHC-phase. The hydrogenation activity of the ruthenium catalyst is hardly affected by water, while a slight decrease in hydrogenation activity was found in the presence of water for the applied Pt catalyst pellets. The authors pointed out that the amount of water in relation to the catalyst mass applied in their studies was orders of magnitude higher than in any realistic real-life application of the LOHC technology. They concluded that these findings allow the direct connection of hydrogen production via electrolysis with subsequent hydrogen storage via LOHC hydrogenation without hydrogen drying. The investments in drying equipment and energy related to the gas drying process can thus be saved if hydrogen from water electrolysis is to be stored using H0-DBT as the LOHC compound.31,226
6.2 Hydrogenation of hydrocarbon LOHC compounds in the presence of methane
The influence of methane on the hydrogenation of the LOHC compound dibenzyltoluene was recently investigated by Dürr et al.4 As a potential technical scenario, the generation of a H2/CH4 gas mixture by Catalytic Methane Decomposition (CMD) of stranded methane was considered combined with subsequent hydrogen storage in the LOHC system. When using a Ru/Al2O3 catalyst for the hydrogenation of H0-DBT at a temperature of 180 °C, no negative effect of methane on the reaction rate could be observed based on a comparison of hydrogenation experiments with identical hydrogen partial pressure. A slight increase in hydrogen uptake in the presence of methane was even found and explained by a reduction of the LOHC viscosity due to dissolved methane. Reduced viscosity of the liquid improves the diffusion of hydrogen into the LOHC phase.4
Jorschick31 reported later that H0-DBT hydrogenation experiments with a H2/CH4 ratio of 3.0 (30 bar H2 and 10 bar CH4) result in no significant negative effect on the performance of alumina supported Ru (180 °C), Rh (180 °C) and Pd (240 °C) catalysts. The alumina-supported Pt (240 °C) catalyst, however, showed a slight decrease of the reaction rate in the presence of methane. In order to demonstrate a technically relevant scenario for LOHC hydrogenation with H2/CH4 gas mixtures, further investigations were carried out in semi-continuous operation mode. At 240 °C, 30 bar back pressure, and a continuous supply of the hydrogen/methane mixed gas feed (500 ml min−1 with a H2/CH4 ratio of 4.0), Jorschick could demonstrate the simultaneous purification and storage of hydrogen by semi-continuous H0-DBT hydrogenation (0.015 mol% Pt based on the applied H0-DBT, continuous gas dosing, no exchange of LOHC in the reactor).31 The gas composition at the outlet of the reactor and the degree of hydrogenation of the organic phase are shown in Fig. 14 over the reaction time. It is seen that an almost stationary operating point establishes after a start-up phase. In this operating range (120–300 min time-on-stream), the hydrogen content in the exhaust gas could be reduced from its initial value of 80% to about 15–20%. This corresponds to a hydrogen volume flow of 18–25 ml min−1 or a hydrogen conversion of 94–96%. The selectivity of the reaction was at least 99.9%. Complete hydrogenation of the LOHC was achieved after 12 hours. Beyond this point in time, hydrogen is no longer consumed in the reaction and the composition in the off-gas slowly approaches the feed gas composition with a H2/CH4 ratio of 4.0.
 Fig. 14  Semi-continuous hydrogenation of H0-DBT with a H2/CH4 mixture at 240 °C – conditions: 30 bar, 1.1 mol H0-DBT, 0.015 mol% Pt, 400 ml min−1 hydrogen, 100 ml min−1 methane, adapted from Jorschick.31 
These experiments demonstrated the potential to separate hydrogen from CH4-containing gas mixtures via LOHC hydrogenation. It can be assumed that other light hydrocarbons, such as ethane, propane and butane, will behave similar to methane. Possible applications of this hydrogen purification and storage technology can be envisaged in the hydrogen recovery from refinery and petrochemical processes, such as naphtha hydrotreatment, hydrodesulfurization or benzene production from methane.
6.3 Hydrogenation of hydrocarbon LOHC compounds in the presence of CO2
In the literature there are a number of publications on the hydrogenation of cycloalkenes and aromatics in compressed CO2 as the reaction medium. This particular mode of operation was investigated in order to benefit from the favourable mass and heat transfer properties of supercritical and subcritical CO2. Arunajatesan et al.265 successfully demonstrated the hydrogenation of cyclohexene in a continuous fixed-bed reactor using a H2/CO2 ratio of 0.055 at 136 bar and 70 °C. During the entire reaction time of 22 h, the applied Pd/C catalyst showed stable activity with a cyclohexene conversion of over 80%. With this catalyst system a full selectivity to cyclohexane was achieved, no competing CO2 hydrogenation to methane was observed. The group of Shirai266–268 studied the subcritical hydrogenation of naphthalene to decalin with a H2/CO2 ratio of 0.6 at 160 bar and 60 °C. They showed that carbon-supported catalysts are more active than alumina-supported catalysts. The best hydrogenation activity was found with rhodium as the active metal. Notably, the naphthalene conversion after 30 min reaction time could be increased from 15.2% (Rh/Al2O3) to 46.9% with a Rh/C catalyst. In the same working group, the hydrogenation of biphenyl to bicyclohexyl on activated carbon supported noble metal catalysts was investigated with an H2/CO2 ratio of 0.6 at 160 bar and 60 °C.269,270 The conversion of biphenyl was found to increase with raising CO2 partial pressure, while the selectivity towards the fully hydrogenated product bicyclohexyl remained constant. The higher catalytic activity was explained by an improved mass transport of the reactants to the active sites of the heterogeneous catalyst in the presence of CO2. Another explanation could be a change in the adsorption properties of the biphenyl feedstock on the metal surface due to the competition with CO2. Fujita et al.271 showed that the presence of pressurized CO2 during phenol hydrogenation (H2/CO2-ratio of 0.25, 200 bar, 50 °C) using Ru/Al2O3 and Rh/C catalysts suppressed the hydrogenation of cyclohexanone to cyclohexanol. The authors suspected that CO was formed during CO2 hydrogenation and this caused severe catalyst deactivation. The same effect was observed by the group of Baiker272,273 during the hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate with Pt/Al2O3 in supercritical CO2. The deactivation of Pt/Al2O3 was attributed to CO formed by catalytic CO2 reduction. Interestingly, other authors have described positive effects of CO2 on the hydrogenation of aromatic compounds. Zhao et al. described such a positive effect for the Pt-catalyzed hydrogenation of nitrobenzene at 35 °C,274 where the reaction to aniline showed much higher selectivity to aniline in CO2 compared to the reaction in ethanol.
In these examples, CO2 was used as the solvent, i.e. in large excess compared to the feedstock. Publications on the influence of smaller amounts of CO2 impurities in the hydrogen used for hydrogenation reactions of aromatics are rare. Taimoor et al.275 reported, for example, full deactivation of an alumina-supported Pt-catalyst when CO2 was added during toluene hydrogenation. At 75 °C, the irreversible poisoning of the Pt surface sites by strongly bound carbonyl species was confirmed by operando diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy. Scalbert et al.276 showed Rh on alumina to be more resistant to the presence of CO2, but also in this case the formation of Rh–CO species was observed. Compared to Pt on alumina catalyst, Rh showed stable toluene conversion after partial deactivation in a toluene/CO2/H2/argon mixture (1:10:100:480, 1 bar, 75 °C). The authors explained the observed deactivation by CO bound on low coordination Rh sites located at the interface with the alumina support.276 The same group reported promising results for a less highly dispersed Rh catalyst supported on a less basic support, i.e. silica. They described that no stable Rh carbonyl was observed on the surface after adding up to 10% CO2 to the hydrogenation feed.277
Jorschick et al.278 investigated a few years later the possibility of selectively binding hydrogen to the LOHC-compound dibenzyltoluene using hydrogen-rich gas mixtures containing up to 30% carbon dioxide. These authors focussed on the LOHC hydrogenation activity and the CO2 methanation activity of alumina supported Ru, Rh, Pd and Pt catalysts in a three-phase reaction system in the temperature range between 100 and 280 °C. The methanation activity of alumina-supported noble metal catalysts during the hydrogenation of H0-DBT is presented in Fig. 15 as the CH4/CO2-ratio in the gas phase after a 20 hour batch experiment with an initial H2/CO2/CH4 ratio of about 3:1:0.
 Fig. 15  Temperature dependent CH4/CO2-ratio in the gas phase after a 20 hour H0-DBT hydrogenation experiment using a H2/CO2 mixture as the gaseous feed. Conditions: 30 bar hydrogen pressure; 1.15/3 g initial amount of CO2; 300 g H0-DBT; 1400 rpm; 20 hour reaction time. Reproduced from Jorschick et al.278 with permission from Wiley, copyright 2018. 
While the Ru catalyst shows a very high tendency for methanation (accompanied by the respective formation of reaction water), Pt was found to be almost inactive in the presence of carbon dioxide. The search for highly active catalysts for the hydrogenation of aromatics that do not form methane or other by-products from the CO2 in the feed gas revealed that supported Pd and Rh catalysts are particularly suitable for this application. The palladium catalyst showed the lowest selectivity to methane formation and promising hydrogenation activity at temperatures above 200 °C even in the presence of CO2. Interestingly, the gaseous phase of the Pd-catalyzed H0-DBT hydrogenation was contained with significant amounts of CO. This shows that the Pd catalyst is producing CO from CO2 but under the reaction conditions CO is not a strong catalyst poison for the Pd-based catalyst. The rhodium catalyst enabled efficient hydrogenation of aromatics in the temperature range between 120 °C and 150 °C with moderate methane formation.278 The initial reaction conditions of these experiments, the hydrogenation activity and the gas phase analysis (after a 20 hour batch time) are summarized in Table 13.

In further investigations it was shown that Rh/C is an even better suited catalyst compared to Rh/Al2O3 at 150 °C. Under the same reaction conditions, the productivity could be increased from 0.39 to 0.84 gH2 g−1Rh min−1 by changing the support, and the CH4/CO2-ratio in the gas phase after a 20 hour batch experiment was reduced from 0.075 to 0.002.31 These results are well in line with the findings by Hiyoshi et al.270 and Shirai et al.266 obtained during the hydrogenation of biphenyl and naphthalene with CO2 as the solvent.
6.4 Hydrogenation of hydrocarbon LOHC compounds in the presence of CO
The existing literature on aromatic hydrogenation reactions in the presence of CO is scarce. Suzuki et al. studied the hydrogenation of naphthalene and tetralin with hydrogen containing 2% of CO using alumina-supported cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium and platinum catalysts at 200 °C and a total pressure of 98 bar.279 Pd proved to be the most active catalyst, while significant methane formation (hydrogenation of CO) was observed with the Co, Ni, Ru and Rh catalysts. Pt catalysts were found inactive for naphthalene hydrogenation in the presence of CO. The results of this study are summarized in Table 14.

Further investigations by Sekine et al. have shown that the hydrogenation of naphthalene with Ni catalysts is only possible if the CO present in the gaseous feed is converted to methane.280 The activity of Pd, however, has been found to be strongly support-dependent. While the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst showed the highest hydrogenation activity with pure hydrogen, the highest activity in the presence of 2% CO was observed with a Pd/SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst.281 The evaluation by FTIR spectroscopy suggests that the electron density of Pd is reduced by the higher acidity of the SiO2–Al2O3 support. The weakening of the Pd–CO bond allows better thermal desorption of CO and leads to an improved hydrogenation in the presence of CO. No methanization of CO was observed with all Pd catalysts under investigation. The increase in catalytic activity using acidic support materials was subsequently confirmed by applying Pd/TiO2 and Pd/AlPO4 catalysts.282,283 Similar investigations with 2% CO in hydrogen were carried out by Gonda et al. but this time toluene hydrogenation was the target reaction.284 Again, Pd on TiO2–SiO2 showed higher activity than Pd on SiO2 due to the higher acidity of the TiO2–SiO2 support which reduces the electron density of the Pd particles and facilitates CO desorption in this way.
The influence of CO in the hydrogen feedstock of the H0-DBT hydrogenation was recently reported by Jorschick et al.30 These authors studied the effect of CO by adding short injection pulses of CO to a hydrogenation system under operation with pure hydrogen. With all of the tested catalysts (alumina-supported Ru, Rh, Pt and Pd) the CO injection led to sudden catalyst deactivation. The conversion of the injected CO to methane resulted, however, in catalyst regeneration over time for all four catalysts. The authors therefore concluded that short-term contamination of the catalysts with CO does not lead to irreversible damage. Among the tested catalysts, Pd on alumina showed the best compatibility with the CO pulse addition.
Further investigations in semi-continuous operation mode (continuous supply of mixed gas to a batch of LOHC compound) revealed that continuous addition of only 0.5% CO does indeed lead to a permanent deactivation of the Ru, Rh and Pt catalysts. Palladium on alumina, in contrast, showed good activity in the semi-continuous hydrogenation of dibenzyltoluene in the presence of this level of CO. At a temperature of 240 °C and 30 bar pressure, the catalyst activity dropped, however, by 86% in comparison to the experiment using pure hydrogen.30 The degree of hydrogenation over time is shown in Fig. 16 for the hydrogenation with pure hydrogen and for the reaction with hydrogen containing 0.5% of CO.

Conditions: 180 °C (left graph); 240 °C (right graph); 30 bar pressure; 0 and 0.5 mol% CO in hydrogen; 1.1 mol H0-DBT; 1400 rpm; 270 min reaction time; 0.04 mol% Ru applied as 0.5 mass% Ru on alumina; 0.05 mol% Rh applied as 5 mass% Rh on alumina; 0.015 mol% Pt applied as 0.3 mass% Pt on alumina; 0.05 mol% Pd applied as 5 mass% Pd on alumina.

Further rise in reaction temperature from 240 °C to 320 °C has a very beneficial effect on the H0-DBT hydrogenation in the presence of CO. Under these temperature conditions even gas mixtures containing 10% of CO could be readily used to hydrogenate and charge the LOHC compound.30 The temperature increase caused a significant rise in hydrogenation activity due to the better desorption of CO from the active Pd sites at elevated temperature. The analysis of the gaseous by-products confirmed at least 98% selectivity for LOHC hydrogenation, even for temperatures of up to 320 °C. The effect of the absolute pressure was negligible. Note that it is beneficial from a process engineering point of view to operate the exothermal hydrogenation step as hot as possible. Hot hydrogenation allows extraction of more valuable reaction heat from the reactor due to the higher temperature level of the extracted heat.
Summarizing the here presented studies on hydrogenation reactions using binary gas mixtures one can state that only palladium is able to charge/hydrogenate an aromatic compound with hydrogen in the presence of water, methane, carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide, respectively. While rhodium showed no activity in the presence of carbon monoxide, it allows high tolerance towards water, methane and carbon dioxide. Particularly in the case of CO2 contamination, hydrogenation was even possible with rhodium catalysts at reaction temperatures below 180 °C, compared to about 240 °C which are required for the tested Pd catalysts. The use of carbon-supported catalysts seems to result in less by-product formation at the same activity.
The use of Co and Ni catalysts has so far only been investigated in the presence of CO. Both metals show some tolerance against CO and moderate activity. To the best of our knowledge, no reports have detailed the selectivity and by-product formation with both metals yet.
Platinum and ruthenium are very sensitive against CO impurities in the hydrogen feed. In the presence of CO2, only ruthenium shows moderate activity in the hydrogenation of aromatic components. The majority of hydrogen is consumed via the hydrogenation of CO2 to methane (methanation). However, both metals are ideally suited for hydrogenation in the presence of water or methane. Thus, both metals offer, for example, great technical potential to apply wet hydrogen from electrolysis or hydrogen from catalytic biomethane decomposition pyrolysis.
6.5 Hydrogenation of hydrocarbon LOHC compounds using hydrogen-rich, multi-component gas mixtures
Many technically relevant green hydrogen-rich feeds contain more than one impurity, thus, they represent multi-component gas mixtures. To the best of our knowledge, there are only two research groups that have studied hydrogenation reactions of aromatics using multi-component gas mixtures. Braekman-Danheux et al.285 studied the hydrogenation of phenanthrene using a synthetic coke oven gas (55% H2, 30% CH4, 3% C2H4, 3% C2H6, 6% CO, 2% CO2 and 1% N2) with NiO–MoO3, CoO–MoO3 and Pd on alumina catalysts at 370 °C and 210 bar total pressure. The presence of carbon monoxide led to a significant drop in the yield of hydrogenated compounds compared to the reaction with the same hydrogen partial pressure but using pure hydrogen. A shift in the product spectrum from fully hydrogenated perhydro-phenanthrene to partially hydrogenated species such as dihydro-phenanthrene tetrahydro-phenanthrene or octahydro-phenanthrene was observed. The presence of CO also led to a significant formation of methane with consumption of hydrogen. The formation of propane was attributed to some Fischer–Tropsch activity of the system.
The second study on this topic was recently published by the authors of this review. Herein, the hydrogenation of H0-DBT using model gas mixtures resembling the compositions of the natural gas (or biogas) steam reforming process and coke oven gas was investigated.30Fig. 17 shows the degree of hydrogenation and the off-gas composition from a semi-continuous hydrogenation experiment which was performed with a gas mixture of hydrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (78:20:2) at 270 °C and 45 bar total gas pressure using 0.15 mol% Pd (in the form of Pd on alumina with a mass loading of 5%) with respect to the applied amount of H0-DBT.
 Fig. 17  Semi-continuous hydrogenation of H0-DBT with a H2/CO2/CO mixture (78:20:2) at 270 °C. Conditions: 45 bar backpressure, 1.1 mol H0-DBT, 0.15 mol% Pd, 390 ml min−1 hydrogen, 100 ml min−1 carbon dioxide, 10 ml min−1 carbon monoxide, adapted from Jorschick et al.30 
For quantitative analysis, the mass flows of the reaction between DoHs of 0.2 and 0.5 were examined. During this time period (147–431 min time of operation), the mean hydrogen content in the off-gas was reduced from the initial 78.0% to 59.6% by the hydrogenation. Besides the remaining hydrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, 0.16 mol% of methane was detected in the off-gas, which can be explained by the hydrogenation of CO and CO2 that proceeds as a minor side-reaction.30
For a quantitative comparison of different operating conditions in semi-continuous MGH, the hydrogen conversion XH2 can be used. According to eqn (13), the hydrogen conversion indicates the proportion of hydrogen extracted from the gas mixture during the LOHC MGH process.   
The highest hydrogen conversion was found at 300 °C and at a gas flow rate of 300 ml min−1. In this case, an average off-gas composition of 37.6% hydrogen, 55.3% carbon dioxide, 6.8% carbon monoxide, 0.16% methane and 0.07% methanol was detected between 0.2 and 0.5 DoH (165 to 512 min time of operation). Thus, a remarkable hydrogen-to-LOHC selectivity of 99.5% was achieved. Furthermore, this experiment proved that even in the presence of more than 50% carbon dioxide and about 7% carbon monoxide an effective hydrogenation of H0-DBT with very low by-product formation is possible.30,31 In the course of these investigations also pelletized, commercial Pd/Al2O3 catalysts showed hydrogen-to-LOHC selectivities of at least 99.5% in the same semi-continuous mixed-gas hydrogenation experiments.31
Similarly encouraging results were found in the same study when using a typical coke oven gas mixture as the feedstock (60% hydrogen, 31% methane, 7% carbon monoxide and 2% carbon dioxide). Again, the reaction conditions were 300 °C, 45 bar backpressure, 0.15 mol% Pd based on 1.1 mol H0-DBT and 300 ml min−1 gas flow rate and the range between a DoH of 0.2 and 0.5 (reached between 277 and 860 min operation time) was used for quantitative analysis. In this experiment, the mean hydrogen content in the exhaust gas could be reduced from 60% to 37.7% due to H0-DBT hydrogenation. This corresponds to a mean hydrogen conversion of 61%. Within the total reaction time of 1630 min, the degree of hydrogenation of the LOHC material increased from 0.03 to 0.76. This demonstrates that also coke oven gas is very suitable for charging the H0-DBT LOHC system using a commercial Pd on alumina catalyst.
A key aspect of the Mixed Gas Hydrogenation concept is the purity of hydrogen which is released from the H18-DBT carrier charged initially with mixed gas feedstocks. For this purpose, Jorschick et al.30 studied the quality of hydrogen released from H18-DBT previously charged with a H2/CO2/CO gas mixture. The hydrogen purity and the obtained hydrogen volumetric flow which were observed during dehydrogenation at 290 °C, 300 °C and 310 °C (240 min for each temperature stage) are shown in Fig. 18.
 Fig. 18  Batch mode dehydrogenation experiment with H18-DBT charged with a H2/CO2/CO gas mixture – conditions: 240 min at 290 °C, 300 °C and 310 °C; 1.06 bar backpressure; 0.72 mol H18-DBT; 0.02 mol% Pt applied as 0.3 mass% Pt on alumina; 1400 rpm. Adapted from Jorschick et al.30 
The purity of the released hydrogen was found to be lowest at the beginning of the dehydrogenation, where the gas released from the LOHC medium contained 99.95 mol% hydrogen (hydrogen quality 3.5). After 60 min dehydrogenation time, all gases physically dissolved in the LOHC had left the reactor and the hydrogen purity increased to 99.99 mol%. With higher dehydrogenation temperature and lower degree of hydrogenation in the applied LOHC (i.e. longer dehydrogenation time), the hydrogen purity went down to 99.97 mol%, without any further purification. The maximum hydrogen contamination detected in this experiment comprised 250 ppm short-chain alkanes, 10 ppm cyclic hydrocarbons, 13 ppm carbon dioxide and 7 ppm carbon monoxide.30
The published work on LOHC hydrogenation using multi-component gas mixtures represents a successful proof-of-concept study. It could be shown that selective reactive extraction of hydrogen from a mixture containing more than 50% carbon dioxide and 7% carbon monoxide is possible. Depending on the contamination level, hydrogen conversions of over 80% with a selectivity of at least 99.5% could be achieved when a Pd catalyst was applied in the catalytic dibenzyltoluene hydrogenation. Furthermore, the hydrogen release from hydrogen-rich dibenzyltoluene, which was charged with a synthetic H2/CO2/CO mixture, was demonstrated with an overall hydrogen purity of 99.9986%. The obtained hydrogen-to-LOHC selectivities and hydrogen purities are comparable to conventional hydrogen separation technologies, such as pressure swing adsorption or membrane separation. LOHC hydrogenation with hydrogen-rich gas mixtures has been shown to enable hydrogen purification and hydrogen storage in one single process step.
7 Conclusion
The hydrogenation of aromatic compounds is a key step in future LOHC-based hydrogen logistics technologies. While industrial research in the hydrogenation of aromatics dates back to the 19th century and many aromatic hydrogenation processes are well-established large scale processes of the petrochemical industry, the specific requirements of the LOHC hydrogen storage cycle (i.e. ultimate selectivity to maximize LOHC recycle) justify a closer look to identify particularly suitable hydrogenation systems. This concerns in particular the selection of an optimal heterogeneous catalyst that depends both on the chemical nature of the LOHC system and on the applied reaction conditions.
Summarizing the most relevant trends from the existing literature for hydrogenation of aromatics with pure hydrogen, it can be stated that ruthenium and rhodium are best suited as active metals if a heteroaromatic LOHC compound is to be hydrogenated, e.g. N-ethylcarbazole (H0-NEC), and the hydrogenation temperature is below 180 °C. For the hydrogenation of pure hydrocarbon LOHC compounds such as toluene, benzyltoluenes or dibenzyltoluenes, rhodium and ruthenium catalysts work best at temperatures below 200 °C. Pt-catalysts are superior with respect to rates and selectivity at temperatures above 200 °C. Note that LOHC hydrogenation at temperatures as high as possible (taking into account catalyst stability and LOHC robustness) is favourable to extract the hydrogenation heat at the highest possible temperature and thus at the highest possible exergy level. Ni catalysts are suitable for the hydrogenation of pure hydrocarbon LOHC systems but show a lower activity per mol of Ni and more by-product formation compared to the best precious metals.
In the broader context of establishing a future green hydrogen economy with the help of LOHC-based hydrogen logistics, it is very important to note that practically all sources of green hydrogen produce hydrogen-rich gas mixtures in the first place. This is true for water electrolysis (hydrogen/water vapour mixtures), biomethane reforming (hydrogen mixtures containing in addition CO, CO2, CH4, etc.), and biomethane decomposition (hydrogen/methane mixtures). Therefore it is economically highly relevant that it has recently been shown that LOHC compounds, such as dibenzyltoluene can be directly charged with hydrogen-rich gas mixtures without a costly (both with respect to investment and operation) gas purification step. Pd-based catalysts have been shown to promote the dibenzyltoluene hydrogenation best in the presence of CO, while Pt is very effectively deactivated by CO. Ru tends to form methane in the presence of CO and hydrogen. An easier case is represented by mixtures of CO2 and hydrogen where next to Pd-based catalysts Rh catalysts have also shown technically interesting performance. The presence of water and methane has been found to be less critical resulting mainly in dilution effects.
The technical relevance of LOHC-based hydrogen storage has recently become more and more obvious. Hydrogenious LOHC Technologies (Erlangen, Germany), founded in 2013, has started to commercialize hydrogen storage equipment based on the H0-BT/H12-BT and the H0-DBT/H18-DBT LOHC systems.286 Following a successful project with the United Hydrogen Group in the United States, container-based dehydrogenation units are currently being developed to supply hydrogen filling stations in Europe. The HySTOC project demonstrates the feasibility of the LOHC technology for the distribution and storage of hydrogen to supply hydrogen filling stations at Voikoski (Finland).287 Another hydrogen filling station is currently planned in Erlangen (Germany).288 The increasing attention for hydrogen storage with these benzyltoluene- and dibenzyltoluene-based LOHC systems can also be seen from the increased consideration of this hydrogen logistics technology in recent techno-economic studies.289–291 It is very obvious that these expanding industrial activities will receive a strong boost by the further successful development of LOHC-charging processes using hydrogen-rich gas mixtures. The economy of LOHC-based hydrogen logistics relies on connecting the cheapest sources of green hydrogen with the hydrogen application cases of highest added value, e.g. for clean mobility applications. Using hydrogen-rich gas mixtures for LOHC charging directly, the economics of green hydrogen harvesting and logistics become much more favourable and this will beneficially contribute to the upcoming hydrogen economy.
