    , Accepted 17th January 2012First published on 18th January 2012AbstractThis work reports a new graphene-based composite for supercapacitor material, and the maximum specific capacitance of 1760.72 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, with excellent cycling stability.
The increasing demand for energy and growing concern about air pollution and global warming has stimulated intense research on energy storage and conversion from alternative energy sources.1 Electrochemical supercapacitors are the most investigated systems as they offer higher power and energy density compared to lithium-ion batteries and conventional dielectric capacitors.2 Nickel hydroxide is an attractive candidate in supercapacitor applications due to its layered structure with large interlayer spacing and high theoretical specific capacitance.3 Ni(OH)2 exists in α- and β-phases4 of which the former is expected to show superior electrochemical properties due to its poorly crystallized structure; it is thus very important to synthesize the α-phase material with high electrochemical capacity on a large scale.
Recently, two-dimensional graphene has attracted multidisciplinary attention due to its high surface area, high flexibility and electrical conductivity.5 Graphene and graphene-based materials can be considered as promising materials for potential electrochemical applications.6 Graphene-based supercapacitors via different synthesis methods have been reported with a specific capacitance from 117 to 1335 F g−1 in aqueous solution.7–10
Herein, we report an economical and environmentally friendly one-step method to synthesize graphene oxide/α-Ni(OH)2 (GN) composites by a hydrothermal route under mild conditions. The composites were synthesized by varying the mass ratio of graphene oxide (GO) to Ni(OH)2 as 1:1, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, 1:30, 1:40, and were denoted as GN1, GN5, GN10, GN20, GN30, and GN40, respectively (see ESI† S1).
The morphology and microstructures of α-Ni(OH)2 and GN composites were characterized by SEM and TEM. The surfaces of α-Ni(OH)2 spheres are bestrewed with many nanoflakelets, forming a hierarchical network-like structure. The side length of α-Ni(OH)2 nanostructures is several hundred nanometres (Fig. S1a†). Sphere-like flowers of α-Ni(OH)2 are randomly decorated on the surfaces of graphene nanosheets, and GN composites are poorly crystallized (Fig. 1a). Compared to GN5, the diameter of GN20 (Fig. S1b†) increases noticeably and graphene sheets can hardly be seen, which is attributed to the high mass ratio of Ni(OH)2 to GO. There is no obvious morphology difference observed between α-Ni(OH)2 and GN20, except that the diameter of GN20 is much larger, which may be due to the presence of α-Ni(OH)2 on GO. EDS (Fig. S2†) and XPS (Fig. S3†) analysis show the presence of Ni, O and C in GN composites, indicating that the spherical α-Ni(OH)2 nanoarchitectures are successfully grown on the surface of GO using a hydrothermal process.

Fig. 2a shows the powder XRD patterns of GO, α-Ni(OH)2, a physical mixture of GO and α-Ni(OH)2, and GN20 samples. For GO, a strong peak at 9.12° is observed, indicating the (002) plane of GO.11 The main peaks of α-Ni(OH)2 are in good agreement with standard powder diffraction patterns of α-Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS No:38-0715). No diffraction peaks from impurities are found in α-Ni(OH)2, indicating that the sample is pure α-Ni(OH)2. The XRD patterns of α-Ni(OH)2, the physical mixture of GO and α-Ni(OH)2, and GN20 are similar to each other. For α-Ni(OH)2 and the physical mixture of GO and α-Ni(OH)2, there is a peak at 2θ = 6.25°(002), but this peak disappears in GN20, which can be attributed to the decrease in order of the hydrotalcite-like features.12 The difference seen in the broadness and intensity of the respective peaks of α-Ni(OH)2 and GN20 are attributed to different crystallinity and crystallite size. The XRD peaks of α-Ni(OH)2 are more intense and sharp compared to those of GN20. This may be due to the poor crystallinity of GN20. Based on the (003) reflection one can determine the interlayer distance of GN20 as ∼7.13 Å. XRD patterns indicate that the GN composites are fully synthesized. FT-IR spectra reveal the existence of –OH (∼3400 cm−1), CO (1726 cm−1), and CC (1629 cm−1) functional groups in GO (Fig. 2b).13 One can see that α-Ni(OH)2 and GN20 have many vibration bands in common as labeled with the dotted lines. The broad band at 3438 cm−1 can be observed in the spectra of α-Ni(OH)2 and GN20 corresponding to –OH vibration of hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups from the metal hydroxide and intercalated water located in the interlamellar space of the turbostratic structure of α-Ni(OH)2,14 while the broader band of GO at 3438 cm−1 is only assigned to stretching vibration of adsorbed water molecules. In the spectra of GN20 and α-Ni(OH)2, the same peaks at 2899 and 2857 cm−1 are attributed to the –C–H vibration mode of –CH2. The strong peaks at 1634 and 639 cm−1 are assigned to the bending vibration of adsorbed water molecules and δOH of hydroxyl group, respectively. The sharp and narrow peak at 1382 cm−1 corresponds to the vibration of NO3− (NO3− anion with D3h symmetry in the interlayer space).15 The absorption bands at 990–1299 cm−1 are attributed to the vibration mode of C–N, and the small peak at 473 cm−1 can be assigned to Ni–O vibrations and Ni–O–H bending vibrations16 that can be ascribed to Ni–OH. The sharp and narrow band at 3640 cm−1 of α-Ni(OH)2 is attributed to the νO–H stretching vibration, which confirms the brucite-like structure of the α-Ni(OH)2 phase.12

Fig. 3a shows the CV curves of α-Ni(OH)2 and GN20 composites at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The CV curve of the GN20 composite implies that the capacitance of the material is mainly associated with the Faradaic pseduocapacitor. It is obvious that the transfer of the electron is reversible.17 The anodic peak is due to the reduction of α-Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH and the cathodic peak is attributed to the reverse process. These peaks correspond to the conversion between different oxidation states of Ni according to the following equation:18α-Ni(OH)2 + OH− ↔ γ-NiOOH + H2O + e−
In Fig. S4a†, the integrated area (specific capacitance) of α-Ni(OH)2 is obviously the lowest, which means that α-Ni(OH)2 combined with graphene shows enhanced capacitance compared to pure α-Ni(OH)2. This is attributed to the high surface area, electrical conductivity, and high flexibility of graphene, which are all very important for high performance pseduocapacitors. The cathode and anode peak current densities of GN20 are much higher than those of α-Ni(OH)2, which suggests that GN20 has a higher electrochemical reactivity and a faster activation. From Fig. 3a, the background signal of Ni foam is negligible. The specific capacitance is proportional to the area under the CV curves7 and values are given in Table S1†. The area under the CV curves decreases in the order of GN20 > GN40 > GN10 > GN30 > GN1 ≈ GN5 > α-Ni(OH)2. Note that GN20 has the largest area, indicating the highest capacitance among the samples (Fig. S4a†). GO is introduced as a binder of α-Ni(OH)2 particles and as a conductive matrix. Many functional groups of GO (hydroxyl, epoxy, carboxyl and carbonyl groups) act as anchor sites for α-Ni(OH)2 particles and can be synthesized in situ at the basal planes and edges of GO. Moreover, GO prevents the aggregation of α-Ni(OH)2 particles, which enables an effective redox reaction at the interface of α-Ni(OH)2 particles and electrolyte. In general, the specific capacitance of materials is directly correlated to the BET surface area, the pore size distribution, microstructures, etc.19 The specific surface area of GN20 is higher than those of other GN composites (Table S2†). For GN30 and GN40, too many Ni2+ ions around GO induce the aggregation of α-Ni(OH)2 particles, leading to poor dispersion of α-Ni(OH)2 particles on GO nanosheets, thus resulting in low capacitance. In this work, GN20 shows the highest capacitance of 1760.72 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1. Lee et al.7 reported α-Ni(OH)2 grown on reduced GO via a non-aqueous approach, with a specific capacitance of 1215 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1. Dai et al.9 reported Ni(OH)2 grown on graphene via a two-step method, with a specific capacitance of ∼1335 F g−1 at a charge and discharge current density of 2.8 A g−1. The difference of synthesis methods and graphene used may lead to different morphology and microstructures of the graphene-based composites, thus leading to the difference of electrochemical pseudocapacitor properties. Fig. 3b shows that after 1000 cycles the current response of GN20 remains almost constant and the peak potential position changes very little, indicating a good electrochemical stability.20 Therefore, GN composites with long-term stability and reversibility are suitable materials for high-performance pseduocapacitor electrodes.

Fig. S4c† shows that as the scan rate increases, the form of the CV curves does not change significantly. This suggests a very high electrochemical reactivity and fast activation indicating high electrical conductivity.21 With the increase of scan rates (Fig. S4c†), the potentials of the anodic and cathodic peaks shift in more positive and negative directions, respectively, which results in higher ΔEa. This is attributed to the strengthened electric polarization and irreversible reactions at higher scan rate. This may be due to the limitation of the ion diffusion rate to satisfy electronic neutralization during the redox reaction. Fig. S4d† shows the results of calculated specific capacitances at different scan rates. Increasing the scan rate in CV studies reveals a decrease in specific capacitance.

Fig. 3c shows the galvanostatic charge and discharge curves of GN composites in 6 M KOH. The shape of the curve is almost triangular, suggesting the high degree of symmetry in charge and discharge. Importantly, the coulombic efficiency is nearly 100% for each cycle of charge and discharge (Fig. S5a†), which indicates that there is no obvious capacitance decrease observed over many cycles at a current density of 5.7 A g−1. These results reveal the high specific capacitance and stability of GN composites as high-performance electrochemical pseudocapacitors. From Fig. 3c, the GN20 supercapacitor shows the longest charge time of 81 s and the highest specific capacitance of 1026 F g−1 at a charge and discharge current density of 5.7 A g−1. Also it is observed that the specific capacitance of the samples decreases in the order of GN20 > GN40 > GN10 > GN30 > GN1 ≈ GN5 > α-Ni(OH)2, which is very much comparable to that calculated from the CV studies. Fig. S5c and 5d† show the galvanostatic discharge curves of GN1 at different current densities. Increasing the discharge current density reveals a decrease in specific capacitance, as for the trend of capacitance variation calculated from the CV studies.
AC electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis is a principal method to examine the fundamental behavior of electrode materials for supercapacitors. In Fig. 3d, all Nyquist plots were characterized by two distinct parts, a semi-circle at high-frequency and a linear line at low-frequency. The equivalent circuit for the impedance analysis is shown in Fig. 3d, where Cdl is a double-layer capacitor, CL is the limit pseduocapacitor, and WS is the Warburg impedance.22 At high frequency, the solution resistance Rs and the charge transfer resistance Rct can be obtained from the Nyquist plot, where the high-frequency semi-circle intercepts the real axis at Rs and (Rs + Rct), respectively. The solution resistance values of Rs are almost identical for the two electrodes. However, there is an obvious difference in Rct. The radius of the semi-circle of GN20 is smaller than that of α-Ni(OH)2, suggesting that the lower resistance and better capacitive behavior of the GN20 electrode than α-Ni(OH)2 electrode (Fig. 3d). This is due to the prevention of the aggregation for graphene sheets by α-Ni(OH)2 anchored on GO. At the same time, the graphene sheets overlap each other to form a conductive network through sheet plane contact, which facilitates fast electron transfer between the active materials and the charge collector. This structure improves the electrochemical performance of the composite electrode, showing a synergistic effect of α-Ni(OH)2 and GO. This result is in good agreement with the capacitance values calculated from the CV curves.
In summary, we have demonstrated the GN composites as an interesting material for an electrochemical pseduocapacitor with long cycle life. The mass ratio of Ni(OH)2 to GO, the morphology and crystallinity are important to the high electrochemical performance of these composites. GN20 shows the highest capacitance of 1760.72 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1.
