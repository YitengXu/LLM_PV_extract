    , Accepted 18th March 2022First published on 18th March 2022AbstractFor the first time, herein, the hydrothermal method with H2SO4 as the solvent is introduced to enhance the rate capability of free-standing pristine PEDOT:PSS films. The film with a record conductivity of 3188 S cm−1 displays a rectangular characteristic at an ultrahigh scan rate of 1300 mV s−1 and a stable specific capacitance of 110 F cm−3 from 0.1 to 100 A cm−3, with a capacitance retention of up to 94.8%. The flexible supercapacitor based on the films delivers a comparable energy density of 2.96 mW h cm−3 even at a high power density of 36685 mW cm−3. This study provides an effective method to prepare PEDOT:PSS films with outstanding electrochemical properties and potentially expand its applications in flexible devices.
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) is the most promising commercial conducting polymer due to its outstanding advantages of excellent film-forming properties, good thermal stability, and tunable conductivity achieved by secondary doping.1 Nowadays, it has been applied in numerous energy conversion and storage devices, such as solar cells,2 thermoelectrics,3 Li-ion batteries,4 and supercapacitors (SCs).5 In recent years, flexible SCs, an indispensable part for electronic circuits, are drawing increasing attention in the development of portable and wearable electronics.6 This has promoted the extensive study of free-standing PEDOT:PSS-related films as electrode materials for flexible SCs. Currently, researchers mainly focus on the improvement of the energy density of PEDOT:PSS-based flexible SCs by preparing PEDOT:PSS hybrid films, such as PEDOT:PSS/rGO composite film of 174 F g−1 and PEDOT:PSS wrapped WO2/Au composites of 462 F g−1.7 The rate capability plays an important role in the application of flexible SCs; however, it has been studied relatively less.
The free-standing PEDOT:PSS-related films, including pristine PEDOT:PSS films and PEDOT:PSS-based hybrid films still suffer from poor rate capability.8 Most previous reports demonstrated that the cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles of free-standing PEDOT:PSS-related films are below the scan rate of 500 mV s−1, usually at 100 or 200 mV s−1.9 The poor rate capability prohibits its further application under extreme conditions, such as high current density. Therefore, it is urgent to address the issue. The reasons for poor rate capability lie in three aspects: (a) a limited ion-diffusion rate in solid-state electrolytes, (b) low conductivity of the electrode material, and (c) the large interfacial resistance between electrochemically active materials and the conducting substrate.10 For electrode materials, high conductivity and homogeneous morphology are key factors to improving the rate capability. A high conductivity accompanied by homogeneous morphology could realize high carrier transport efficiency even under a high current density.
At present, several technologies have been developed to enhance the conductivity of free-standing PEDOT:PSS films, such as (a) thermal and light treatment, (b) organic solvents, ionic liquids, surfactants, salt and acid treatments,1 and (c) compositing with other materials.11 However, the strategy of compositing PEDOT:PSS with other materials may potentially bring a heterogeneous dispersion and even structural instability, resulting in poor reaction reversibility and rate capability. Therefore, in this study, we selected the free-standing pristine PEDOT:PSS film as an electrode material. The hydrothermal method is a process that takes place at different temperatures in a sealed vessel. This method simultaneously provides a high temperature and pressure environment. We think that external vapor pressure might endow the PEDOT:PSS film with a compact and ordered structure. Based on the above consideration, the hydrothermal method was employed to fabricate high conductivity free-standing pristine PEDOT:PSS films.
Herein, a free-standing pristine PEDOT:PSS film is prepared by suction filtration, followed by the hydrothermal method using H2SO4 as the solvent (Fig. 1, details in Fig. S1, ESI†). High temperatures and pressures were simultaneously provided during the film preparation. The temperatures and corresponding pressures are shown in Table 1. Samples were abbreviated according to temperature as HT-RT, HT-80, HT-100 and HT-120, respectively.

XRD spectra, S 2p high-resolution spectra were obtained to explore the structural changes of HT-RT, HT-80, HT-100, and HT-120. As shown in Fig. 2a, all samples exhibited a strong peak (100) at ∼6.5° with its second order (200) at ∼12.5°, indicating a particular lamella stacking between two distinct alternate orderings of PEDOT and PSS.12 The intensity of (100) increases first and then decreases as the temperature increases, demonstrating that the crystallinity first increases and then decreases. The phenomenon is mainly due to favourable crystallization under a high temperature and pressure, but at extremely high temperature and pressure the crystallinity is damaged.13 Moreover, the peak (100) is at 6.6° for HT-80, while the one of HT-RT is at 6.2°. The peak evidently shifted to a higher angle by 0.4°, which implies a decreased lamella stacking, and hence less energy is required for the charged carriers to hop, thereby increasing the conductivity.14Fig. 2b exhibits the changes in the binding energy of samples by detecting the S 2p spectra. The peaks of HT-RT, HT-80, HT-100, and HT-120 at 164.1, 163.6, 164.0, and 163.9 eV, respectively, are related to PEDOT sulphur atoms, while the peaks with higher binding energies at 168.4, 167.9, 168.0 and 167.8 eV are associated to PSS sulphur atoms, respectively.15 The intensity of PSS for HT-80 is lower than the others under the same intensity of PEDOT peaks, indicating that the insulating PSS of HT-80 is effectively detached (Fig. S2, ESI†). This phenomenon is also beneficial for conductivity enhancement. In addition, compared to HT-RT, the S 2p binding energy in PSS for the heat-treated samples (HT-80, HT-100, and HT-120) is reduced to ∼0.5 eV, which is consistent with the protonation of PSS-SO3− groups.16 More discussions on XPS are found in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Fig. 2c displays the TG curves of HT-RT, HT-80, HT-100, and HT-120 from 25 °C to 100 °C. The TG curves from 25 °C to 800 °C are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The weight losses are 9.5%, 9.5%, 10.5% and 11.2%, respectively, which are attributed to the reduced evaporation of water molecules. Water adsorption increases as the temperature increases, and it demonstrates that the structure is destroyed under extreme temperatures. The results are consistent with XRD analysis. Moreover, the adsorbed water could result in the swelling of the PEDOT:PSS film, thereby increasing the thickness of films.17Fig. 2d–g illustrates the phase and 3D topography images of HT-RT, HT-80, HT-100 and HT-120. Bright areas and dark matrix refer to the PEDOT:PSS-rich phase and PSS-rich phase, respectively.18 Evidently, the PEDOT:PSS of HT-80 can be uniformly dispersed in the PSS matrix. However, the dispersion becomes worse as the temperature increases. HT-120 exhibits a characteristic phase separation of PEDOT:PSS and PSS. Moreover, the Rq of HT-RT, HT-80, HT-100, and HT-120 are 12.0, 8.3, 16.1 and 19.0 nm, respectively. The HT-80 presents an excellent smooth structure, which is also verified by SEM images in Fig. S5 (ESI†) and Fig. 2h. This is due to the compact effect of an appropriate external pressure. However, the morphology degradation of HT-100 and HT-120 may have resulted from the gradual destruction of the structure with the increase in temperature and pressure. Moreover, a layered structure can be observed in the SEM image, and the structure could enhance the capacitance of films (Fig. 2i). As the results demonstrate, an appropriate temperature could improve the crystallinity and morphology and promote the removal of PSS. The above characteristics endow the film with an outstanding conductivity. However, extremely high temperatures will bring about side effects in crystallinity, morphology, and conductivity. HT-80 exhibits the highest crystallinity with a decreased lamella stacking, effective PSS detachment and excellent morphology, which could endow it with outstanding conductivity.

Table 2 shows the thickness, sheet resistance and conductivity of HT-RT, HT-80, HT-100 and HT-120. The thickness and sheet resistance first decrease and then increase with the increase in temperature. The HT-80 possesses the thinnest thickness of 2.55 μm and the lowest sheet resistance of 1.24 Ω sq−1, and thus, the highest conductivity of 3188 S cm−1. This is associated with the appropriate temperature and pressure (80 °C/11 kPa), which compacts the PEDOT:PSS film to a thinner thickness and effectively removes PSS phases. However, a higher temperature and pressure (>80 °C/11 kPa) destroys the structure of PEDOT:PSS, causing the swelling of films by absorbing water molecules. The results are well consistent with the above structural analysis.

The electrochemical performance of HT-RT, HT-80, HT-100 and HT-120 was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) tests in a three-electrode configuration. The CV profiles of samples from 200 to 1300 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Fig. 3a shows a CV comparison of samples at a scan rate of 1300 mV s−1. It is worth noting that HT-80 still presents rectangular characteristics at an extremely high scan rate of 1300 mV s−1, displaying a prominent advantage over the other samples of HT-RT, HT-100, HT-120 and the existing pristine PEDOT:PSS films due to its excellent conductivity.5 This indicates an outstanding capacitive response of HT-80. Fig. 3b shows the GCD test results of HT-RT, HT-80, HT-100 and HT-120 at 5 A cm−3 in a voltage window of 0–0.8 V. The GCD curves are highly symmetrical, implying an excellent diffusion-controlled process. The specific capacitances of samples and their capacitance retentions, calculated from GCD tests from 1 to 100 A cm−3, are concluded (Fig. 3c and d). HT-80 shows a high and stable specific capacitance of ∼110 F cm−3 compared with the others from 1 to 100 A cm−3. The capacitance retention of HT-80 is as high as 94.8%.

According to the theory of Igor V. Zozoulenko et al.,19 the capacitance mainly originates from electrical double layers formed along the interfaces between nanoscale PEDOT-rich and PSS-rich interconnected grains. Therefore, a higher crystallinity could provide more interfaces between PEDOT-rich phases and PSS-rich phases to store charges. The excellent conductivity accompanied by a homogeneous morphology could ensure the excellent charge transportation efficiency to maintain high capacitance even at a high current density. Hence, HT-80 could achieve outstanding rate capability. Moreover, we also found that the capacitance of HT-120 is higher than that of HT-100. However, the capacitance retention of HT-120 (66.7%) is lower than that of HT-100 (72.8%). This is because the structure is destroyed more severely under a higher temperature. The destroyed structure, filled with certain amounts of water molecules, enhances the capacitance. Moreover, the damaged and unstable structure exhibits a large capacitance loss as the current density increases.
The SC was constructed based on HT-80 films, as shown in Fig. 4a. CV and GCD measurements were carried out to explore its electrochemical properties. Fig. 4b shows the CV characteristics of SC. The CV curves present a close-to-rectangle shape from 200 to ultrahigh 1300 mV s−1, indicating that the device has outstanding capacitive response based on the HT-80 films. Fig. 4c displays the GCD curves of SC, which also reveal a precise triangle characteristic. The volumetric capacitance, calculated from GCD tests, decreases from 57.5 to 39.5 F cm−3 as the current density increases from 0.1 to 100 A cm−3 (Fig. 4d). The capacitance loss is only 31.3%, which is due to the limited ion transport efficiency of the solid-state electrolyte. Moreover, 95% specific capacitance can be maintained after a long-term cycle (10000 cycles) test at a scan rate of 10 A cm−3 (Fig. 4e). The above-mentioned results reveal that the device possesses an excellent capacitance response. Energy density and power density of the devices were calculated. As shown in Fig. 5f, the device shows a maximum energy density of 5.11 mW h cm−3 at a power density of 40.0 mW cm−3. More noticeably, the device could maintain a high energy density of 2.96 mW h cm−3 at a very high power density of 36685 mW cm−3, which outperforms most previous reports.5,20,21

In summary, a high conductivity free-standing PEDOT:PSS film is fabricated by employing a novel strategy of hydrothermal method, attributed to the synergistic effects of temperature and pressure. The obtained free-standing PEDOT:PSS film exhibits a new record conductivity of 3188 S cm−1 and a stable specific capacitance of ∼110 F cm−3 with a high capacitance retention of 94.8% from 0.1 to 100 A cm−3. The flexible SCs based on the free-standing PEDOT:PSS films show a maximum energy density of 5.11 mWh cm−3 at a power density of 40.0 mW cm−3 and even a high energy density of 2.96 mWh cm−3 at a very high power density of 36685 mW cm−3. We believe that this study could expand the applications of PEDOT electrodes on flexible devices, particularly on fast charge energy devices. This study may provide a good reference for the preparation of high conductivity conducting polymer films.
