    , Accepted 17th January 2011First published on 2nd March 2011AbstractBiofuels have become an attractive alternative fuel because of their possible environmental benefits and the current concern over the depletion of fossil fuel sources. The demand for biofuels will rise in the future due to the rise in the price of fossil fuel, energy security reasons, environmental and economical issues. Vegetable oils are the most common feedstocks and are converted into liquid fuels due to their high energy density, liquid nature and availability as a renewable feedstock. Several types of vegetable oils with a diversified composition in fatty acids can be used. Beside edible vegetable oils, non-edible and used cooking oils have also received considerable attention because they do not compete with food sources and are less costly to procure. Beside vegetable oils, bio-oil obtained from the pyrolysis of biomass has also been upgraded through catalytic cracking process to obtain biofuel. Catalytic cracking is one of the most efficient methods to produce biofuel, especially biogasoline, by cracking of vegetable oil in the presence of suitable catalyst. The catalytic cracking of edible and non-edible oils requires the development of proper cracking catalysts and reactors for the production of biogasoline. The present article summarizes progress in the development of the technology in biofuel production viacatalytic cracking. The paper also covers the different types of feedstock suitable for the production of biofuel, potential cracking catalysts, catalytic cracking mechanisms, different types of catalytic reactors, and biofuel characteristics. Important issues like catalyst choice and reactor design must be addressed before catalytic cracking can be commercially implemented. The paper also presents the future prospects of this technology in biorefineries for the production of biofuels.

Broader context
Biofuels are important renewable energy sources which will substitute petroleum fuels in the near future. Catalytic cracking is one of the most efficient methods to crack renewable feedstock in the presence of catalyst to produce biofuel. Beside edible vegetable oils, non-edible and used cooking oils have received considerable attention as feedstocks for the production of biofuel. The catalytic cracking of edible and non-edible oils requires the development of proper cracking catalysts and reactors for the production of biofuel such as biogasoline. The present article summarizes progress in the development of catalytic cracking technology in the biofuel production. This review covers the feedstocks, catalysts, reactors, biofuel characteristics, research done in Malaysia in the area of biofuel, and future prospects of this technology to be implemented in the biorefinery for the production of biofuels.

1. Introduction
Recently, the world's energy supply and demand system is facing number of challenges. With the world total consumption of petroleum reaching 84 million barrels per day in 2005, the known petroleum reserves are estimated to be depleted in less than 50 years, at the present rate of consumption, by 2.7% per year.1
Exhaust emissions from transport motor vehicles using fossil fuels is one of the most important issues contributing to pollution and global warming. The diminishing supply of fossil fuels, environmental awareness, and increasing energy consumption and prices are the primary factors leading to the search for alternative sources of energy to replace petroleum-based fuels. Therefore, research and development on alternative fuels is intensively reported by researchers all over the world to meet the future needs of energy globally.
Alternative and renewable energies cover a wide range of technologies including solar power, fuel cells, geothermal energy, hydropower, wind power, hydrogen production, and biofuel.2 One of the most promising alternative fuels is biofuel. Biofuel is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous fuel derived from the utilization of biomass substrates as renewable or combustible renewable feedstocks, and can be used as a (partial) substitute for fossil fuels.3 Various liquid fuels can be produced from renewable resources. These include biodiesel, ethanol, methanol, and Fischer–Tropsch gas oil using synthesis gas obtained from biomass. It is likely that the role of biofuel produced from renewable resources will increase and provide solutions to overcome a broad set of future energy, environmental and economic challenges.
The production of biofuel, such as biodiesel and biogasoline, as an alternative fuel obtained from natural oils or fats are environmentally friendly because they are free of nitrogen and sulfur compounds (meaning there will be less greenhouse effect and less local air pollution).4 Biofuels do not add to the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere, and for that reason they are considered to be “CO2 neutral”, since they are from plant sources which typically remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and release the same amount when burnt. Biofuel can be used as either a fuel substitute or fuel additive to reduce vehicle emissions.5 Moreover, it is important that alternative fuels must be suitable for its usage directly without requiring major changes to the engine.
Biomass is one of the most important biological energy resources. Biomass-derived feedstocks are classified into three categories: cellulosic biomass, starch- and sugar-derived biomass (or edible biomass), and triglyceride-based biomass, which is generally vegetable oil.6 Cellulosic biomass can be converted to bio-oil through fast pyrolysis in the absence of air at atmospheric pressure, a low temperature (450–550 °C), high heating rate (103–104 K s−1), and short residence time to crack into short chain molecules, and can be cooled to liquid rapidly.7 The properties of bio-oils depend on factors such as biomass feedstock, production process, reaction conditions and collection efficiency.7 One of the techniques to improve bio-oil thermal stability and also to reduce their oxygen content, is upgrading of bio-oils and other cellulosic molecules by catalytic cracking. Compared to hydro-deoxygenation, the advantages of catalytic cracking include that no H2 is required, atmospheric processing reduces operating cost, and the temperatures employed are similar to those used in the production of bio-oil.6 Although catalytic cracking is regarded as a cheaper route, poor yields and quality of hydrocarbons and high yields of coke (8–25 wt%) may be obtained. In the present review, we present and discuss converting triglyceride-based biomass, i.e. vegetable oil, into biofuel. The utilization of cellulosic biomass and starch- and sugar-derived biomass, is not covered in this review and is beyond the scope of this article.

Fig. 1 presents different types of edible and non-edible oil as feedstocks for biofuel production through catalytic cracking. Triglyceride based feedstocks from agricultural fats and oil can be classified as edible oils, used cooking oil, non-edible oil, fatty acid mixtures, and fats as well. The production of biofuel depends on a number of factors, and one of the key factors is the local availability of feedstock. The choice of this feedstock depends mainly on its availability, cost and climate in each country.8 An important criterion to determine the suitability of vegetable oil as a feedstock is its composition. The composition of oil subsequently determines the properties of the biofuel obtained. Several types of edible vegetable oils, as well as non-edible oil with a different composition in fatty acids, are used for the production of biofuel. However, the direct conversion of edible oil to fuel may not be economically feasible, even though the results have shown its potential in obtaining liquid hydrocarbons. Continuous and large-scale production of biofuel from edible oil without appropriate planning could cause negative impact on the food supply chain, causing further economic problems. A potential solution to overcome this problem is to utilize waste used cooking oil or non-edible oil.9
 Fig. 1  Types of feedstock for biofuel production. 

Triglyceride based vegetable oils or animal fats are prospective feedstocks to be used as sources of fuel or hydrocarbons, under the right processing conditions. However, before the unprocessed oil can be used as fuel the feedstock properties must be significantly improved.10 Typically, four methods are used to improve the properties of vegetable oils and fats feedstock, and these include (1) dilution with diesel fuel or solvents, (2) microemulsification, (3) transesterification, and (4) pyrolysis.11,12,13,10
Thermal degradation of aliphatic long chain compounds is known as thermal cracking. The larger molecules convert into the smaller molecules, such as alkanes and hydrogen, in the cracking process.14Catalytic cracking of vegetable oil involves the pyrolysis of vegetable oils in the presence of solid catalyst that can improve products yields.6 In the cracking process, the reaction temperature used is lower than pyrolysis, and large molecules are degraded to smaller compounds by dehydration, dehydrogenation, deoxygenation, and decarboxylation. Catalytic cracking is considered as a cheaper route in terms of energy consumption, by converting feedstock to lighter fractions that mostly fall in the gasoline boiling range.15 With atmospheric processing conditions, the operating cost is reduced. Over transesterification, pyrolysis has advantages in terms of a lower processing cost, engine and fuel standards, feedstock flexibility and compatibility with infrastructure.16 Another advantage of catalytic cracking over pyrolysis is that the product quality of pyrolysis is highly dependent on the type of feedstock used.
This review focuses on edible and non-edible oil as a feedstock and how these feedstocks can be used for biofuel production through catalytic cracking processes. The article covers the different types of vegetable oil feedstocks suitable for the production of biofuel, potential cracking catalysts, catalytic cracking mechanisms, different types of catalytic reactors and biofuel product characterization. The paper also presents the future directions and issues to make catalytic cracking process technology economical and commercially feasible in future biorefineries.
2. Feedstocks
A variety of feedstocks for the production of biofuel from triglyceride based agricultural fats and oils can be divided into 4 types: crude vegetable oil (palm oil, rapeseed, soybean), used vegetable oil (waste cooking oil), animal fats (lard, tallow) and non-edible oil (castor oil, tall oil, jatropha).17 Vegetable oils have a high energy content, and are pH neutral and relatively stable in liquid form. With their liquid nature, vegetable oils are easy to transport and process.18,19
Fats and oils are primarily water insoluble, hydrophobic substances in the plant and animal kingdom that are comprised almost completely of triglycerides (made up of one mole of glycerol and three moles of fatty acids of long carbon chain, usually 16 to 18 carbon atoms in length connected via the carboxyl group to a glycerol backbone), and small amounts of mono- and diglycerides.20,21

Table 1 presents common types of vegetable oils available in different parts of the world. In most of Europe, rapeseed and sunflower oils are mainly used as a feedstock for biofuel production. Rapeseed or canola oil is widely cultivated throughout the world for vegetable oil for human consumption, the production of animal food, and diesel biofuel. While in the United States, soya is one of the most widely produced edible oils, and the major source of vegetable oils for manufacturing diesel biofuel.22 In Asia, coconut oil is commonly used in the Philippines. palm oil is commonly utilized in the South-East Asia (mainly Malaysia and Indonesia). In Malaysia, oil palm is widely grown; in 2008 nearly 17.7 million tonnes of palm oil was produced on 4.5 million hectares of land, and Malaysia was the second largest exporter of palm oil after Indonesia.23 Besides being used as cooking oil, palm oil has been used as raw material in oleochemical industries. In 2007, palm oil was the most widely produced tropical oil in the world, followed by soybean, rape (canola), sunflower and cottonseed.24 Production of palm oil and soybean oil contributed more than half of worldwide edible vegetable oils production. However, utilization of edible oil as biofuel feedstock has negative impacts, such as competing with the supply of food. Therefore, non-edible oil is one of the solutions of this problem, and oils such as jatropha, castor, and karanja, are emerging as biofuel feedstock.

Apart from the availability and cost of the raw materials, the properties of the vegetable oil are important when assessing whether the feedstock is a suitable source for oil conversion. The composition of the oil determines the properties of the biofuel obtained (especially for biodiesel).9 The composition for various types of edible and non-edible oils is presented in Table 2. The types and percentages of fatty acids contained in vegetable oils depend on the plant species, and on the growth conditions of the tree.25Table 2 shows that the major oil composition in both non-edible and edible oils is generally similar, except for castor oil.
The major fatty acid content in both non-edible and edible oils are oleic, linoleic, stearic and palmitic acids. The major fatty acids in soybean, sunflower oil, rubber seed and polanga triglycerides are linoleic acid, while oleic acid is the majority in corn, canola, jatropha, karanja. These fatty acids present in the oils are further categorized into saturated and unsaturated forms. The former include stearic, palmitic, lauric and myristic acid, while the latter include oleic, linoleic, erucic, palmitoleic, linolenic and myristoleic acid.26

Generally, the chemical properties of used cooking oil are similar to fresh oil, and may differ in the composition from source to source. Table 3 presents the differences in the fatty acid composition between palm oil, canola, sunflower and its used oil, respectively. Used palm oil (UPO) contains equal amounts of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids like crude palm oil (CPO). However, the palmitic acid concentration decreased from 40 to 22.5 wt%, while oleic acid concentration decreased from 36 to 27.6 wt% in the used palm oil.30 The drop in concentration of these fatty acids is compensated by the increase in the concentration of palmitoleic acid, stearic acid and linoleic acid. During the cooking process, the palmitic concentration in UPO and oleic acids in used canola oil are decreased. The water content in UPO is relatively high as compared to the fresh edible oil as a result of frying. During the frying process, oil is heated in the presence of air and light at temperatures of 423–463 K for a relatively long period of time. Some common physical changes were observed in used vegetable oil, such as an increase in viscosity and specific heat, a higher tendency of fat formation, and changes in surface tension and color.9 The formation of a high number of new compounds is due to three common reactions during the frying process, namely oxidation, hydrolysis, and polymerization reactions. Hydrolysis increases the amount of free fatty acids, oxidation produces hydroperoxides and low molecular weight volatiles such as short chain alkanes, and dimers and polymers are also produced by radicals and Diels–Alder reactions.31 Although UPO has less unsaturated fatty acids compared to fresh palm oil due to degradation after frying, the characteristics of the biogasoline produced from UPO are similar to biogasoline produced from palm oil.32

Used cooking oil, which is otherwise wasted, is one of the most economical choices to produce biofuel. Used cooking oil has been used in the production of biodiesel.35 The price of feedstock is one of the major concerns of biofuel production, and the utilization of used cooking oil will significantly enhance the economic viability of biofuel production. Large quantities of used cooking oils are available throughout the world, especially in developed countries.36 The exact quantity of used cooking oil available from fast food restaurants is difficult to obtain, since there is no proper system to collect used oil from these resources. Since fast food restaurants are increasing all over the world it is expected that used cooking oil will be available as a potential feedstock for biofuel production, once a proper collection system is implemented.
Much reported research has focused on assessing the suitability of edible and non-edible oils as feedstocks.37,38ASTM methods provide characterization procedures to measure their important properties. Table 4 presents the characteristics of oils and characterization tools used in the characterization of vegetable oil used as a feedstock for cracking.

Table 5 presents a comparison of the important properties of waste cooking oil, biodiesel from waste cooking oil, commercial diesel fuel, and commercial gasoline. The properties of biodiesel and diesel fuels, in general, show many similarities, and therefore, biodiesel is rated as a realistic fuel as an alternative to diesel. The important requirements of transport engines, as listed in Table 5, should be met by biofuels. One of the most important properties of biofuel is its viscosity. Table 5 shows that used cooking oil has very high viscosity as compare to diesel fuel. A high value of viscosity leads to poorer atomization of the fuel spray and less accurate operation of the fuel injectors, while too low viscosity can lead to excessive internal pump leakage. Therefore, the viscosity of the biofuel must fall within a certain range since it is so important for combustion. Other important properties, especially for cold weather operation, are pour point and cloud point. Other properties such as sulfur content, carbon residue, and ash are responsible for corrosion and forming residues on engine parts.17

3. Cracking
A catalytic cracking process is applied in the conversion of high boiling point, high molecular weight gas oil into valuable gasoline and olefins at petroleum refineries. Catalytic cracking of plant oils, animal fats, and recycled cooking greases can be used to produce biofuels that are suitable for gasoline engines that contain linear and cyclic paraffins, olefins, aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids.6
The products obtained from catalytic cracking include gas, organic liquid product, water, and coke. The organic liquid product is composed of hydrocarbons corresponding to the gasoline, kerosene, and diesel boiling point ranges. The boiling point ranges are defined according to the boiling range of the petroleum products in the three fractions: gasoline fraction (333–393 K), kerosene fraction (393–453 K) and diesel fraction (453–473 K).43
When plant oils are heated in the absence of air, homogeneous non-catalytic reactions rapidly occur since plant oils are thermally unstable. Catalytic cracking is favorable in producing gasoline, and also lowers the yield of heavy fuel oils and light gases at much lower temperatures compared to thermal cracking. Catalytic cracking involves the pyrolysis of plant oils in the presence of solid catalysts, which have been employed to improve the production of gasoline and the total yield of the organic liquid product (OLP) of vegetable oils. Compared with the hydrotreating process, catalytic cracking is more advantageous because it does not require hydrogen, and also it is performed under atmospheric conditions, thus reducing operating costs.6
All triglycerides can be broken into one glycerol molecule and three fatty acid molecules. The carbon chain length and the number of double bonds in the fatty acids vary depending on the source of oil. Katikaneni et al.44 proposed a reaction pathway for the catalytic cracking of canola oil, while Leng et al.45 proposed a typical reaction scheme for the cracking of palm oil. A reaction pathway for catalytic cracking vegetable oil over a zeolite catalyst is proposed and shown in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Proposed reaction pathway for the conversion of palm oil over an HZSM-5 catalyst to hydrocarbon products.19,45 
The first step involves the initial thermal decomposition of triglyceride molecules. Triglyceride molecules are primarily decomposed to oxygenates and heavy oxygenated hydrocarbons such as fatty acids, ketones, aldehydes, and esters. The mixture of heavy hydrocarbons and heavy oxygenated hydrocarbons is regarded as “residual oil”. It was assumed that primary cracking occurs within the internal pore structure of zeolite catalysts.
Once the initial cracking occurs, the next step involves the secondary cracking of heavy hydrocarbons and oxygenates. Both are thought to undergo secondary cracking to form gas products such as short and long chain paraffins and olefins, CO, CO2, H2O, and alcohols. Their reactions to reach other products start by the breaking of the C–O and C–C bonds via decarboxylation (CO2) and decarbonylation (CO). The light olefins then undergo oligomerization reactions to produce olefins and paraffins, which could be used as gasoline, diesel, and kerosene. The heavy oxygenates can also be deoxygenated, while aromatic hydrocarbons are also produced by aromatization to form C9+ aromatic hydrocarbons. Aromatic hydrocarbons are also produced by aromatization, alkylation, and isomerization.
Furthermore, the aromatics can undergo polymerization reactions to produce undesired coke, or condensation of oil molecules, or both.44,45 It is likely that the catalytic cracking of vegetable oils for the production of desired products, such as gasoline and olefins can be improved by understanding the chemistry together with other related factors such as catalyst and reactor performance.6
3.1 Kinetics of catalytic cracking of vegetable oil
Information obtained from product analyses by evaluating the reaction parameters from kinetic studies, helps establish the economic feasibility of process scale up, as well aiding transfer of technology to industry for the production of biofuels from vegetable oil cracking. The kinetic studies of the cracking of used palm oil and fatty acid mixtures (FAM) with different reactors was reported using a transport riser reactor,46 and a fixed bed reactor.47,48,49,50,51 In the catalytic cracking process, a number of reactions take place, resulting in different types of products. Due to the large number of components involved in the cracking process, and also the complexity of the reactions, it is not easy to explain the kinetics of biofuel formation at the molecular level. Therefore, grouping of the products has been proposed as cuts or lumps to simplify the analysis of cracking kinetics.52 Lumps are formed by grouping the components with similar chemical functions of the hydrocarbons produced into a few categories of pseudo-components, and these lumps were used to model the kinetic behavior of multi-component mixtures in the catalytic cracking process. Incorporating more products in the model could increase the number of lumps. The complexity of the model varies according to the degree of lumping proposed.
Several researchers compared the kinetic model of cracking vegetable oil with the cracking of gas oil in a Fluidized Catalytic Cracking (FCC) reactor. The gas oil catalytic cracking is one of the most important processes in a modern refinery and is oriented towards maximum production of high octane gasoline. Several models have been proposed for the catalytic cracking of vacuum gas oils (VGO). A five-lump model for heavy cycle oil and gas oil cracking in a micro-activity testing (MAT) unit, reported by Ancheyta-Juarez et al.52 and Souza et al.,53 applied a six-lump kinetic model to simulate the gas oil cracking process in a riser reactor. Cerqueira et al.54 reported very complex models, such as a 12-lump model. To predict the behavior of commercial FCC units accurately, it is necessary to use kinetic models with a detailed product distribution. However, including more lumps will make the process of kinetic parameters more intrinsic, thus more kinetic parameters need to be estimated, and accordingly more experimental information is required.52
The reaction parameters and reaction order were estimated from the experimental data. The experimental data comprised of the conversion and yield of products, obtained with the variation of residence time . The data collected from the experiment were used to find the cracking reaction parameters, and to estimate the yield of products using a model based on the experimental data.55
The lumps of cracking products were based on the weight fraction. The sequential strategy was used to lump the cracking feedstock and products into a three-lump, a four-lump, and a six-lump model with their corresponding rate parameters of three to six based on the lumping system used, and is shown in Fig. 3. The three-lump model, which includes gaseous products, coke and organic liquid products (OLP), assumed that feedstock can be directly converted to these products. The four-lump model (Fig. 3b) was constructed by separating the gaseous product and coke in the three-lumped model into two individual lumps. A six-lump model comprises the gasoline fraction, diesel fraction, kerosene fraction, gaseous product, unconverted feed oil, and coke. The organic liquid products in the four-lumped model were separated into three lumps based on their boiling point ranges, which consisted of a gasoline fraction (333–393 K), kerosene fraction (393–453 K) and diesel fraction (453–473 K). The rate constants in the three-lump model (k1, k2, and k3) were determined by nonlinear regression analysis, using the least-squares method. The FAM and UPO cracking were observed to follow first-order kinetics.51 Encinar et al.49 reported that the kinetics of gas generation of the pyrolytic process was first-order with respect to the olive oil residue, while catalytic cracking of spent vegetable oil over sulfated zirconia was fitted by a second-order reaction.56

The kinetic model was also used to predict the cracking product yield in a transport riser reactor.46 By using reaction temperatures from 673 to 723 K, and residence times from 0 to 80 s, the yield profiles of reactants and products were obtained as a function of reactor length and time. The model predicted the conversion and gasoline fraction yield with an average error of 10% in the temperature range 698–773 K for CPO cracking in the transport riser reactor.46 It was found that the composition of the feedstock affected the conversion as well as the product distribution, while the reaction rate was affected by the type of feedstock. Furthermore, a suitable kinetic model was developed to provide useful information for the design of a catalytic reactor. The simulated results agreed well with the reported experimental data in a transport riser reactor. The deactivation function was also incorporated in the kinetic model for cracking in MAT. However, for cracking in the transport riser reactor, Bhatia et al.46 proposed a model which did not consider the catalysts’ deactivation function since the catalysts did not show significant deactivation during the experimentation, due to a shorter palm oil residence time in transport riser.
The activation energy required for the cracking was calculated from the Arrhenius plots of the respective reaction rate constants. The activation energy was found to be dependent on the feedstock and type of catalyst used. Composite catalysts had a tendency to decrease the activation energy for the cracking reaction as compared to HZSM-5(40) in the cracking of UPO.57 Diffusion phenomena could not be ruled out, and likely affected the activation energy during cracking reactions.55 Compared to the cracking of FAM, a higher activation energy was required for the formation of OLP from UPO cracking. The lower activation energy was obtained for the formation of an intermediate in the cracking of FAM, possibly due to the presence of unsaturated fatty acids. Generally, the activation energy values were comparable with the cracking of gas oil. It was also found that, compared to the activation energies obtained for the gas oil cracking, cracking of used palm oil gave lower activation energies due to the presence of triglycerides and oxygen, which are very active in forming carbenium ions on the catalyst, which enable the cracking that occurred at lower activation energy.58Table 6 presents values of activation energy estimated from different lump models.

4. Cracking catalysts
In direct catalytic conversion processes, the choice of catalyst is important due to its role in controlling the type of product yield and selectivity of components present in the biofuel. The properties of catalyst are governed by acidity, pore shape and size.59 Different types of microporous (zeolite), mesoporous (MCM-41 and SBA-15), macroporous (silica-alumina, alumina) and composite microporous–mesoporous catalysts are reported for the production of biofuel from palm oil,60,61 waste vegetable oil,9fatty acid mixtures,62 soya bean oil,63 canola oil,64 and sunflower oil.33,65 Xu et al.63 reported the use of base catalyst in the production of biofuel. The cracking catalysts is divided into two categories based on pore size and acid strength, as shown in Fig. 4. Based on pore size, catalysts fall as microporous, mesoporous, amorphous and composite catalysts containing all types of pores. Catalysts are classified into acid, base and neutral types based on their chemical properties.

Catalysts for biofuel production through catalytic cracking. 
There are number of studies reported on the cracking of vegetable oil into biofuel using different catalysts, which are presented in Table 7. There are reports that catalytic cracking using different feedstocks with different characteristics (especially fatty acid component) affect the yield and characteristics of the products. The catalysts, reactor and operating range in the catalytic cracking of vegetable oil are also shown in Table 7. Recently, there has been growing interest in the cracking of vegetable oil, and within the last three years there have been large numbers of research publications reported in the literature.

Among the various feedstocks, vegetable oils, soybean, palm oil and canola oil are highly utilized, due to their mass production worldwide. In the cracking of vegetable oil, a microporous catalyst is preferred since selectivity of biofuel products such as the gasoline and diesel fractions is produced through the small pores of the catalyst. Microporous catalysts such as zeolite are widely employed in cracking vegetable oil. Different types of zeolites are reported based on their secondary building units and structure. Zeolites have excellent properties, in terms of high acidity, high thermal stability and excellent selectivity for gasoline production. As shown in Table 7, one of the most commonly used zeolites is HZSM-5. The role of HZSM-5 in the catalytic cracking unit was as an octane-boosting additive due to its higher selectivity towards aromatic hydrocarbons.83 However, mesoporous and macroporous materials have also been employed as cracking catalysts and have advantages over microporous types in terms of hydrothermal and thermal stability. One of the most important operating conditions in the cracking process is the reaction temperature, which affects the product distribution, especially the organic liquid and gaseous products. With the assistance of a catalyst, the temperature needed in catalytic cracking is relatively low compared to pyrolysis. The cracking temperature of vegetable oil is within the range of 653–873 K, while FCC is also operated in a similar temperature range. It can be seen from the table that most of these studies, were performed in labs using MAT unit, glass type reactors or continuous reactors. There are few studies reported on the pilot plant scale.
4.1 
          Catalysts based on pore size

Zeolites are crystalline microporous aluminosilicates with open framework structures of three dimensional tetrahedral units, generating a network of pores and cavities having molecular dimensions. These materials are widely used in separation, catalysis, ion exchange, and adsorption, due to their unique properties such as molecular sieving, high thermal stability, acidity, adsorption capacities, shape selectivity and ion exchange. With its remarkable properties, zeolite has received considerable attention in cracking vegetable oil to biofuel, especially with its high acidity and selectivity to the gasoline fraction. Table 8 presents different types of zeolites and their properties.

In the range of microporous zeolites, the medium pore zeolite catalysts are more effective in the aromatization of the intermediate olefin products compared to those with large pore zeolites. The conversion of canola oil and the overall yield of hydrocarbons decreased as the pore size of catalyst was increased. Also, the medium pore zeolite catalysts are more effective in the aromatization of the intermediate olefin products compared to the large pore zeolites. The medium pore size zeolite ZSM-5 gave the best performance among three zeolite catalysts tested in terms of conversion, gasoline and benzene, toluene, and xylene as aromatics yield.44
The pyrolysis of used sunflower oil in a fractionating packed column was studied using the HZSM-5 catalyst,78 and the amount of HZSM-5 catalyst was varied. Nearly complete conversion (96.6%) of the used oil and the maximum hydrocarbon yield (33%) was obtained at the highest temperature and catalyst amount, and lowest column length. The liquid hydrocarbon phases contained of n-alkanes, n-alkenes, and only small amounts of aromatics.
One group of researchers has extensively studied the conversion vegetable oils, primarily canola, over a variety of zeolite catalysts under different reaction conditions,19,44,82 and with the addition of steam.19 The catalysts were HZSM-5 and a variety of its hybrids. The reaction was carried out in a fixed bed micro reactor at a temperature between 573–773 K, at atmospheric pressure, and WHSV (weight hourly space velocities) of 1.8–3.6 h−1. Typical results showed high conversion (up to 100 wt%) of the canola oil with high concentrations of aromatics in the organic liquid product fraction. It was found that HZSM-5 was the most effective type of zeolite catalyst for converting vegetable oil to the gasoline range hydrocarbons.19,44
A mesoporous catalyst with a large pore diameter of 2 nm ≤ pore diameter ≤ 50 nm, possessing a uniform and hexagonal-structured channel and thick walls, will provide better thermal stability compared to a microporous catalyst. These mesoporous catalysts are MCM-41 and SBA-15, and are suitable for bulky molecules due to their large pore size. Overall, the performance of catalytic cracking of the mesoporous materials gave a lower gaseous yield and higher coke formation due to their lower acidity, and they are selective to the formation of diesel fractions.

Silica-alumina is an amorphous material and has Brønsted and Lewis type acids with moderate strength and no shape selectivity. However, most of these sites are buried in inaccessible locations, thus leading to low acidity and consequently lower activity with no shape selectivity compared to zeolite catalysts.44 Compared to that of HZSM-5, silica-alumina has lower acid site density.79Silica is a non-acidic, amorphous and non-shape selective catalyst. It was reported that yields of various products and compositions of both the gas and OLP fractions obtained for runs with a silica-alumina catalyst were almost identical to those obtained for γ-alumina catalyst.80 Under the operating conditions used, high yields of aromatic hydrocarbons were obtained with shape-selective catalysts, such as HZSM-5 and silicalite, whereas high yields of aliphatic hydrocarbons were obtained for non-shape-selective catalysts, such as silica-alumina and γ-alumina.79 Junming et al. reported that Al2O3 and MCM-41 gave similar product compositions compared with a blank experiment. Quirino et al.74 reported the catalytic activity of alumina doped with tin and zinc oxides in the composition of the pyrolysis products of soybean oil. For gas composition distribution, ethylene, total C–C, olefins and the straight chain C, hydrocarbon fractions were higher for silica alumina and γ-alumina catalysts than those obtained for an HZSM-5 catalyst. In contrast, the fractions of both the C–C, paraffins and branched chain C hydrocarbons were higher for runs with HZSM-5 than those for silica-alumina or γ-alumina. These results show that hydrogenation and isomerization reactions took place with HZSM-5 rather than with silica-alumina or γ-alumina. However, the higher yield of aromatic hydrocarbons for runs with silica-alumina and γ-alumina (acid catalysts) as compared to silica (a non-acid catalyst), and the empty reactor, shows that the catalyst acidity contributed significantly to the modification of the thermal cracking scheme by increasing the extent of the aromatization process.
4.2. 
          Catalysts based on their chemical characteristics
The product distribution is governed by the characteristics of the catalyst, especially the pore size and acidity. Ooi et al.86 reported that the acidity in HZSM-5 zeolite decreased as the Si/Al ratio was increased, hence the yield of gaseous products was notably decreased with the increase of the Si/Al ratio. The strength of the acid sites was found to play an important role in palm oil cracking. The gasoline yield increased with the increase in the Si/Al ratio due to a decrease in the secondary cracking reactions and the drop in the yield of gaseous products. Hence the lower acidity of HZSM-5 decreased the secondary cracking reactions resulting in a higher yield of liquid products.
The acidity was not the main factor in controlling the activity of mesoporous material in palm oil cracking. It has been reported that accessibility to the acid sites in mesoporous materials (MCM-41) plays an important part in the cracking.87 The acidity and pore size of the catalysts showed significant effects in the conversion and product distributions in palm oil cracking. HZSM-5 with higher acidity gave higher conversion, but for mesoporous material, acidity was not the major factor for palm oil cracking.
The acidity of the catalyst, as well as its shape selectivity properties, strongly affect the observed product distribution. For instance, in a recent study44 on the conversion of canola oil over a number of catalysts (namely, HZSM-5, HY, H-mordenite, silica-alumina, silicalite and aluminium-pillared clay) it was observed that the HZSM-5 catalyst (on account of its shape selective property) in particular was highly selective for aromatic hydrocarbons in the liquid fraction (termed the organic liquid product, OLP). These hydrocarbons were mostly in the gasoline boiling range. On the other hand, silica-alumina (which is amorphous in nature) was highly selective for aliphatic hydrocarbons. In addition, with the HZSM-5 catalyst, a gaseous product was obtained which contained various olefins and paraffins. Zeolite HZSM-5, due to its high acidity (a large number of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites), coupled with its high selectivity (related to a network of internal canals with well-defined diameters) leads to the formation of short-chain linear hydrocarbons, cyclic, aliphatic and aromatic compounds, such as benzene, toluene and xylene. On the other hand, because of its high number of acidic sites, amorphous pore structure and low specific area, silica-alumina leads to the formation of short-chain hydrocarbons with a greater proportion of aliphatic hydrocarbons, to the detriment of the aromatic hydrocarbons.71
Cracking of soybean oil with a base catalyst (Na2CO3, Al2O3, K2CO3) in the temperature range 623–673 K was reported by Junming et al. (2009). A basic catalyst produced a diesel like chemical composition, with low acid values and good cold flow properties. The use of a basic catalyst helped in reducing the carboxylic acid content in the fuel.
Demirbas88 investigated ZnCl2 for the cracking of sunflower oil. It was found that conversion increased with an increase in reaction temperature. The maximum conversion, as well as gasoline content, was reached at temperature 660 K. As the temperature exceed this temperature, the conversion gradually decreased as more coke deposited on the catalyst surface.
Sunflower oil was used as feedstock to obtain light fuel products at temperatures of 673 and 693 K.33 It was found that with an increase in concentration of Na2CO3 and temperature, the formation of liquid and gaseous products increased. Moreover, the product distribution was strongly dependent on the reaction temperature, residence time and catalyst content.33 Idem et al.80 reported that the presence of basic centers in a catalyst inhibits the decomposition of long chain hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons, resulting in the formation of a small amount of gas and a large amount of residual oil.
4.3 Deactivation
Much research has been carried out on the deactivation and coking behavior of zeolite catalysts.89,90,91 This deactivation could be expressed in terms of process time or the deactivating agent i.e. coke on the catalyst, without an explicit link to the operating conditions. The catalyst decay phenomenon could be quantified using empirical functions of the time on stream.92 The formation and deposition of coke on zeolite occurs preferentially on strong acid sites. This reaction results in a gradual decrease in catalyst activity, or even causes complete catalyst deactivation by covering acid sites or by blocking the access of reactant molecules to acid sites.
A deactivation function in the catalytic cracking of palm oil in a fixed bed reactor was also reported by Ooi and Bhatia,60 and Bhatia et al.93 The catalytic activity of catalysts dropped with increasing time on stream due to coke formation during the cracking reaction and deposition on the catalyst. However, the use of coke on the catalyst as a measure of catalytic activity was reported to be difficult, therefore the deactivation model was developed assuming that catalyst activity (φ) is dependent on the time on stream (t), which is a nonselective model. The rate of the deactivation is presented as:92 (1) Where kd is the deactivation rate constant and nd is the order of catalyst deactivation.
The deactivation rate constant, kd and deactivation order nd, for different catalysts, can be calculated from the best fitted model. The value of kd and nd varied with the type of cracking catalyst used. Some catalyst followed the linear deactivation law, whereas some catalysts followed exponential and hyperbolic deactivation laws. It is reported in the literature that the cracking of gas oil followed the exponential law, and also depends over time on stream operation.52 However, this assumption was not true for the palm oil cracking study. The gas oil is relatively heavier than palm oil, and also contains sulfur and heavy metals such as vanadium.52 In the transport riser reactor however, there was an insignificant amount of coke formation observed during cracking. The much shorter residence time of the catalyst contributed to insignificant catalyst deactivation in a transport riser reactor compared to that in the microreactor, and therefore it was neglected in the product list.46 Composite catalysts comprised of microporous and mesoporous/macroporous deactivated with a lower deactivation rate as compared to their microporous (HZSM-5) or mesoporous (alumina and MCM-41) catalysts alone, respectively. The presence of alumina in the composite catalyst enhanced their thermal and hydrothermal stability, resulting in lower deactivation rates. However, the mesoporous catalyst (Al-MCM-41, Al-SBA-15) alone tends to give a higher deactivation rate constant, due to its mesostructure which is responsible for higher coke formation. A composite catalyst comprised of two different phases increased the catalyst stability.93,94
Investigations have been reported on the kinetic models of coke combustion of different zeolites with various reactions using different methods. In general, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) has gained great acceptance.91,95 Hong and Benxian67 investigated the coke in a zeolite catalyst derived from the cracking of cottonseed oil. It was found that soft coke was distributed inside the pore of the catalyst, which covered the active center and blocked the pore, resulting in a reduction in performance of the active center in the pore and deactivation of the catalyst. Characterization of the coked catalyst showed that the amount, nature, and location of coke deposited on the catalyst depended strongly on the reaction time. Coke is preferentially formed on strong acid sites, especially strong Lewis acid sites.
It was reported that at all temperatures, a higher amount of hard coke was formed than coke precursors during the deactivation. The amount of coke precursors decreased with increasing reaction temperature due to a high desorption of coke precursors into the gas phase ,while the amount hard coke increased with temperature, as expected from an activated process. Less coke at high reaction temperature resulted in high conversion.90
4.5 
          Catalyst characterization
The catalysts were characterized using different analytical techniques in order to find out their properties and attempt to understand their activity behavior. Table 9 lists the types of analytical techniques used to determine different properties of catalyst used for cracking vegetable oil.

Characterization can be classified into two categories, namely (1) physical properties and (2) chemical properties. Physical properties include crystallinity, morphology, surface area and thermal stability. Chemical properties include chemical composition, acid strength and basic strength. Typical catalyst characterization has been widely employed, such as crystallinity and type of catalyst confirmation by XRD, and others such as morphology by SEM and TEM. Other characterization methods one could employ to characterize the catalyst include coke content by thermogravimetric analysis, and hydrothermal stability by investigating the loss of surface area and change in morphology.
Mesoporous and macroporous structures with larger pores tends to have higher surface areas compare to microporous structures. It has been reported by Twaiq et al.61 that with increasing surface area the conversion of palm oil was also increased. However, Idem et al.80 reported that the surface area of the catalysts did not affect the level of conversion of canola oil. The difference in canola oil conversion and product yield for different catalysts was mainly due to the difference in their pore structures and shape selectivities, and not on account of their surface areas.
Another important property of a catalyst is its acidity or basicity, and a number of researchers have conducted studies using catalysts possessing widely different characteristics, i.e. Lewis or Brønsted acidity, weak or strong acid sites, and high or low acid site density, to investigate the effect of these properties in cracking vegetable oil. Characterization was done with fresh catalysts, as well as used catalysts after cracking. The characterization of used catalysts includes coke content, hydrothermal stability, change in morphology, and loss of crystallinity.
5. Biofuel research in Malaysia
Palm oil is a suitable feedstock for biofuel production. High yields of biofuel and low production costs with palm oil as a feedstock are two of the major factors that make this vegetable oil attractive in terms of economics and environment in Malaysia. As the world's second largest palm oil producer, research and development in Malaysia in the area of biofuel is conducted by both government institutions and in the private sector. To maximize the utilization of palm oil, in the development and management of adequate, affordable and consistent energy in form of biofuel, staying in line with economic development and environmental protection are the main challenges for R&D in this area. Based on the current technology and applications, some aspects of research and development in Malaysia can be classified as follows:97
• Adequate legislation and implementation of research activities: The Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB), established in 2000 as a government agency under the purview of the Ministry of Plantation Industries and Commodities, entrusted with the functions of promoting and developing the nation's palm oil industry. As the country's premier oil palm R&D institution, MPOB is committed to ensuring the development of the Malaysian palm oil industry through research and development.23
• National policies: According to Ninth Malaysian Plan (Rancangan Malaysia K9) (RMK9) the development of biofuel using palm oil as a renewable source of energy will be undertaken during the Plan period.
• Research in university: Extensive research in this area has been conducted in Universiti Sains Malaysia,46,86,98 Universiti Malaya,99,101,100,102 Universiti Teknologi Petronas,103,104 Universiti Putra Malaysia,105,106 and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia.107,108
By the end of 2007, Malaysia's first biodiesel plant with an annual capacity of 100000 tonnes opened in the state of Pahang. Malaysia is becoming one of the leading biofuel producers, with 91 palm oil plants approved, and there are five biodiesel plants operating in Malaysia with the total capacity 399000 ton/year.109
One of the breakthroughs in Malaysia for the utilization of oil palm biomass as a source of biofuel is co-operation between Malaysian based Genting Sanyen Bhd and BTG Biomass Technology Group BV, as the first completed pyrolysis plant in Malaysia.110,111 In recent research development of biofuel to overcome the long standing pour point problem of palm biodiesel (pour point = 288 K), MPOB has developed a process to produce low pour point palm biodiesel (252–273 K) which is suitable for temperate countries.23 However, issues concerning this crop that are damaging its image as an environmentally friendly vegetable oil may determine whether Malaysia eventually becomes a major producer of biodiesel.112 The palm oil industry has recognized this concern, and in conjunction with the WWF has formed the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) which endeavours to ensure development of palm oil in a sustainable way.134
5.1 Research at the Universiti Sains Malaysia
Prof. S. Bhatia and his research group from Universiti Sains Malaysia reported catalytic cracking of palm oil and related products (used palm oil, fatty acid mixture) with various catalysts. Microporous zeolite ZSM-5, Beta Y, as well as mesoporous MCM-41/SBA-15 and its modification and composite, were used as catalysts and additives, employing the MAT and transport riser reactor for cracking (Table 10).

Statistical design of experiments was also applied in the catalytic conversion of the three different zeolites. It was found that the selectivity of the catalyst was affected by the acidity of the catalyst and shape of the catalyst pore, as well as the location of active sites inside the pores. The effect of the reaction temperature on the palm oil conversion was positive, while an increase in WHSV gave a negative effect. The role of the shape selectivity was more important compared to the effect of reaction temperature, as shown in Fig. 5.115Fig. 6 presents the conversion of palm oil and product selectivity over HZSM-5 with different Si/Al ratios by catalytic cracking. With a lower Si/Al ratio, more acid sites were available for cracking to occur. However, the gasoline yield increased with an increase in Si/Al ratio due to the decrease in secondary cracking reactions and the drop in the yield of gaseous product.55
 Fig. 5  Performance of different zeolites as a catalyst in palm oil cracking at different temperatures.115 
 Fig. 6  Performance of zeolite ZSM-5 as a catalyst with different Si/Al ratios.55 
Ooi et al.62 applied design of experiments (DOE) coupled with response surface methodology to study the activity of HZSM-5 for the cracking of FAM at different operating conditions. The operating variables affecting cracking activity were feed/catalyst ratio, reaction temperature and weight hour space velocity (WHSV), with the last two variables being found to be the most important. A higher reaction temperature and low feed rate gave a higher yield of gaseous product, while at a low reaction temperature and high feed rate deactivated the catalyst faster. The gasoline fraction was one of the desired products, and the optimum operating conditions were determined to maximize its yield. The optimum condition for cracking FAM was at a temperature of 440 °C, WHSV of 3.66 h−1, and a feed/catalyst ratio of 9.64, which obtained the maximum gasoline yield of 44.4%.
Tamunaidu and Bhatia113 reported the catalytic cracking of CPO and UPO using rare earth zeolite Y (REY) catalyst in a transport riser reactor. DOE was applied to determine the optimum value of reaction temperature, feed/catalyst ratio, and residence time. In order to increase gasoline yield, whilst at the same time to reducing the yield of coke, the optimum reaction condition was a reaction temperature of 450 °C, residence time 20 s and catalyst/oil (CTO) ratio of 5 g−1. Conversion of 70% and yield of gasoline fraction of 35% were obtained from UPO. The transport riser reactor was found to be suitable for the continuous production of biofuel from the cracking of CPO over the REY catalyst.
The effect of surface area, acidity and pore size of the mesoporous MCM-41 catalyst was investigated.96 It was found that the conversion of palm oil increased with the increase in surface area of the catalyst. The selectivity of gasoline and kerosene also increased, and selectivity of diesel was independent of the change in surface area as well as average pore size. MCM-41 was selective for the formation of linear hydrocarbons due to the large size of the pores compared to the size of the products. However, the effect of pore size was more pronounced at a medium pore size distribution compared to the larger pore sizes because of being closer to the triglyceride molecule. The crystallinity and weak acidity of mesoporous MCM-41 also contributed to the catalytic activity. Nevertheless, the mesoporous catalyst gave higher coke formation compared to the zeolite catalyst. The high coke formation was due to low acidity and higher pore volume.
The effect of the Si/Al ratio of mesoporous the SBA-15 catalyst was investigated by Twaiq et al.. SBA-15 is a mesoporous material with thick walls and highly ordered hexagonally arranged mesopores. It was reported that the acidity increased with an increase in the amount of aluminium incorporated into the framework, which resulted in an increase in activity for gaseous and coke formation. Secondary cracking reactions played an important role in gasoline and kerosene fraction yields and increased with a decreasing Si/Al ratio. The weak acidity led to cracking of the linear chain (fatty acid) into linear paraffin and olefins without further isomerization to naphthenes or aromatics. However, the conversion of fatty acid was found to depend strongly on the Si/Al ratio.
The catalytic activity of a catalyst in its fresh state is an inadequate measure of its true commercial performance. During operation in a commercial cracking unit, the catalyst is deactivated by thermal, hydrothermal and chemical degradation. Hydrothermal stability is important in the development of catalyst with a high mechanical and thermal stability, because in its application, a zeolite catalyst will be subjected to steam treatment. Ooi et al.4 studied the hydrothermal stability of mesoporous materials (SBA-15 and Al containing SBA-15). Al-SBA-15 showed high hydrothermal stability and cracking activity compared to pure siliceous SBA-15 due to its less uniform pore structure. With its larger surface area, more regular pore structure and optimum Si/Al ratio, AlSBA with Si/Al = 20 resulted in high selectivity to the gasoline fraction, thus making Al-SBA-15 a more promising catalyst compared to Al-MCM-41 in terms of hydrothermal stability, selectivity and activity.
The composite catalyst contained both microporous and mesoporous material.87Zeolite can be more effective for larger reactant molecules if the microporous structure is combined with mesoporous materials having higher adsorption capacity. The synergy between the catalyst surface area and the right pore size and acidity of MCM-41 contributed to the catalyst activity and selectivity. The composite catalyst showed better hydrothermal and thermal stability with a lower deactivation rate compared to its parent catalyst.9
Ooi et al.51 reported that the composite catalysts consisting of ZSM-5 gave a high yield of gasoline fraction. Both HZSM-5 and MCM-41 catalysts were desirable in converting palm oil to liquid hydrocarbons. The role of HZSM-5 in catalytic the cracking unit was as an octane-boosting additive due to its higher selectivity towards aromatic hydrocarbons. However, HZSM-5 had a larger tendency to produce gaseous product compared to other zeolite catalysts in palm oil cracking. Hence, mesoporous materials were introduced as a diluting component to moderate the activity of the zeolite.51,87
Composite materials containing microporous material coated with mesoporous materials, with a manipulated coating composition of mesoporous silica or aluminosilicate, were studied by Ooi et al.60. The mesopores and surface area of MCM-41 contributed to the cracking and selectivity. The synergy between the catalyst surface area sharing pore size and the acidity of MCM-41 contributed to the catalytic activity and selectivity in the cracking process. The increase in Si/Al ratio increased the selectivity for gaseous and coke formation, but there was a little drop in the selectivity of total organic liquid products (OLP). BET surface area of the composite material played an important role in catalytic cracking. Composite materials containing a lower ratio of mesopore coating were preferred and improved the yield of gasoline fraction.

Table 11 presents the catalytic activity of composite MCM-41/Beta prepared via a seeding method, two-step crystallization, H-beta, MCM-41 and a physical mixture of MCM-41/Beta for the cracking of used palm oil. The composite materials have the advantages of both the microporous and mesoporous materials, thus the pre-cracking of the bulky molecules by the MCM-41 layer before entering the zeolite Beta resulted in the a higher yield of the gasoline fraction in OLP. With MCM-41 alone, OLP consisted mainly of linear alkanes which gave low octane numbers. The shape selectivity characteristic of zeolite Beta promoted the production of branched alkanes, alkenes and aromatics and thus, raising the octane number.

The use of additives along with the catalyst in the cracking of vegetable oil had a significant effect on the product distribution. The product distribution of the organic liquid product obtained was different when using different additives as catalysts in the cracking process of palm oil and used palm oil, as reported by Chew et al.84 In this investigation, REY was studied as a base catalyst and different types of zeolite (Beta, HZSM-5), as well as mesoporous catalyst SBA-15 and Al SBA-15, were chosen as additives.
When HZSM-5 was used as an additive it produced more OLP and a high gaseous product, indicating its high cracking activity. The gasoline fraction yield was the highest for the catalyst containing HZSM-5, with the lowest Si/Al ratio. There was a drop in acidity with an increase of Si/Al ratio, which further weakened the secondary cracking and resulted in a drop of gasoline yield. REY zeolite containing HZSM-5 as an additive increased the palm oil cracking compared to REY alone. Due to accessibility limitation of the reactant through the pore openings, zeolite Beta was less active compared to HZSM-5 for the production of gasoline fraction.
The product distribution and the yield were also affected by the acidity of Al-SBA-15 in terms of product distribution, with AL-SBA-15 favoring the formation of OLP with a higher concentration of gasoline fractions at the expense of kerosene and diesel. Aluminium containing SBA-15 was more selective towards gasoline compared to purely siliceous SBA-15. This was due to the larger surface area and more regular pore structure of Al-SBA-15, and improved accessibility towards active site.
6. Reactors
To optimize the operation of the catalytic processes in a biorefinery not only catalyst activity and selectivity should be considered but also reactor design, as this is also important to optimize the production of biofuel. Fig. 7 presents the different types of reactors employed both in the laboratory and pilot plant scales. Most of the work reported in the production of biofuel through catalytic cracking uses laboratory scale reactors. The role of the laboratory scale reactor is more for catalytic activity measurement rather than for biofuel production. Laboratory reactors used for catalyst activity studies include glass types, fixed bed or fixed fluidized bed reactors. Table 12 presents the reactor types used for production of biofuels on the laboratory scale. Besides the reactions that take place within a single fluid phase (such as acid–base catalyzed condensation), there are also multiphase reactions (liquid–gas–solid catalyst) which are affected by diffusion and thermal effects. These reactions need heterogeneous reactors like a fluidized bed, entrained flow reactor, trickle bed, slurry phase, bubbling bed or fixed bed reactors to facilitate adequate contact between fluid phases and the catalyst.116 Temperature, heating rate, residence time and type of catalyst choice are important process control parameters.117

6.1 Laboratory scale reactors

a. Reactors made of glass. 
Several types of laboratory scale techniques for cracking vegetable oil using glass type reactors have been reported.17,65,74,63 A simple cracking apparatus used in a laboratory is shown in Fig. 8. The main difference between laboratory scale cracking and the others is that the laboratory scale glass cracking reactor is batch type whereas others reactors are operated continuously.
 Fig. 8  Laboratory glass made reactor: a. round-bottom three-necked flask; b. thermocouples; c condenser; d. graduated collector; e. electric resistance.74 
Laboratory scale glass vessels for cracking are almost exclusively run as batch reactors coupled with distillation units. The reactor contains a boiler in which the feedstock is heated by external heating. When the temperature inside the reactor reaches 573 K, the vegetable oil is cracked and vaporized, a condenser in which the heated vapor is cooled back to the liquid state, and a receiver in which the product of cracking, is collected. The liquid fractions are obtained in the collector, an aqueous fraction and an organic fraction. The organic phase is weighed to give the yield of organic liquid product (yield of OLP) and analyzed further by analysis instruments such as gas chromatography and FTIR. The residue in the reactor is weighed to give the residual oil and coke yield63


b. Fixed bed reactor. 
The Micro Activity Test (MAT) is widely used to characterize performance of FCC catalysts due to its relative simplicity and low cost. As strictly defined by ASTM Procedure D-3907, the MAT provides a relative activity for conversion of a standard feedstock. However, MAT testing has been expanded to provide additional information such as product selectivity, operating variables and feedstock effects.
One of the most common systems is the fixed bed micro activity test, or MAT unit, mainly used as a tool for catalyst screening, selective determination of kinetics and analysis of the kinetic data obtained for the cracking reactions.118 MAT is easy to operate, but the hydrodynamics are not well defined and are different from the commercial unit riser reactor. The MAT unit is suitable for screening catalysts based on their catalytic activity. Ooi et al.4 demonstrated catalytic cracking of palm oil into an organic liquid product (OLP) at 723 K in a microreactor unit similar to a MAT unit by using microporous HZSM-5 zeolites, mesoporous MCM-41 zeolites and composite catalysts containing microporous and mesoporous materials. The product OLP yield varied from 56 to 78 wt%, gas yield from 7 to 22 wt%, water yield from 1 to7 wt%, and coke yield from 1 to 12 wt%, with a high conversion of palm oil at 77–99 wt%. A schematic diagram of the laboratory MAT catalytic cracking unit is shown in Fig. 9. A known amount of catalyst is charged into a MAT unit. The feedstock is fed using the syringe pump to the reactor. The flow rate used in the process study varies depending on the value of WHSV. A furnace is used to heat the reactor to the desired temperature, to a maximum of 873 K. The products acquired after the reaction section of the reactor flow directly into a condenser located in the product collection section. The product is cooled in the condenser. The liquid product is collected in a glass liquid sampler while the gaseous products are collected in a gas-sampling bulb.

In the fixed-bed reactor and the fluidized-bed reactor, the long average contact time used during operation is sufficient for both types of reactions to form gas products, and reactions of the gas to form OLP take place. Consequently, large amounts of OLP are formed at the expense of the gas products for runs in the fixed-bed reactor. This higher gas/OLP ratio implies that the net rate of formation of gas is higher in the fluidized-bed reactor than in the fixed-bed reactor, and conversely, that the net rate of formation of OLP was lower in the fluidized-bed reactor than in the fixed-bed reactor. Table 13 lists the differences between the microactivity reactor and tests conducted in fluidized catalytic cracking.

            Transport riser reactor. 
Tamunaidu and Bhatia113 used a laboratory scale transport riser reactor for the cracking of used palm oil. In the reactor, the catalyst and oil were transported and came into contact within the reactor. The gas and solid flow regimes in the reactor were operated by reducing back mixing and improving heat transfer. The transport riser reactor was operated continuously. Furthermore, the catalyst to oil ratio (CTO) and residence time in the transport riser reactor were simultaneously adjustable, in contrast to MAT. The oil and catalyst in the transport riser reactor were injected perpendicularly to maximize feed and catalyst contact ratio. A schematic of transport riser reactor is shown in Fig. 10. The reactor consists of an adjustable length stainless steel tube, adjustable according to the desired residence times of the catalyst and oil. The oil and catalyst were preheated to the selected temperature before being introduced to the reactor perpendicularly. Spent catalyst was collected in the cyclone and the products were collected after being condensed.
 Fig. 10  Schematic diagram of a laboratory catalytic cracking transport riser reactor. 
In order to increase the gasoline yield, while at the same time reducing the yields of coke, researchers have found that short contact times (SCT) between the catalyst and oil vapors and high temperatures are favorable. The riser cracking process had usually been adopted: in this case, the contact time over the upflow riser reactor was about 5–8 s.120 In the FCC operation, the catalyst and feed were in contact at the bottom of the riser with cracking reactions proceeding along the length of the riser. At the end of the riser, the catalyst and products were separated in a closed cyclone directly coupled to the end of the riser.
Though riser reactors have demonstrated their prospective use in the lab scale, occurrence of a non-uniform flow regime (where gas and solids flow) caused by gravity and back mixing of solids (which enhances coke and dry gas formation), limited conversion, and the selectivity to liquid products needs to be addressed before it can be scaled up. A high concentration of catalyst tends to flow near the wall while most of the gas flows through the core dilute region of the tube.121 This type of flow would subsequently result in extensive backmixing of solids which lowers the gas–solid contact efficiency. Den Hollander122studied riser reactors which need a high velocity for the catalyst to move smoothly through the bends of the reactor, and the ideal flow regime was reached at >4 m s−1. Hence, a concept of a ‘downer’ type riser reactor was suggested where the only difference was that the catalyst and vapor oil flow concurrently downward in the same direction with gravity to reduce back mixing of solids. However, it should be noted that the gas solid mixing varied according to operating conditions in the riser reactor along with catalyst properties such as size and density.
Idem et al.80 reported that in the fluidized-bed reactor, the short average contact times were sufficient for reactions that lead to the formation of gas products to take place, but not sufficient for the subsequent reactions of the gas to form OLP. This was responsible for the high gas/OLP ratios for operations in the fluidized-bed reactor. However, large amounts of coke formed under typical FCC conditions, leading to catalyst deactivation. These results could be improved by operating under proper conditions with a proper catalyst. In order to increase the gasoline yield and reduce the coking phenomenon, many researchers have found that a short contact time (SCT) between catalysts and oil vapors at moderate temperatures is highly preferable. Regeneration of the deactivated catalyst can be carried out continuously in a regenerator by burning the coke deposited on the catalyst in air to maintain its activity.123 In addition, the catalytic cracking reaction is endothermic while the regeneration process is exothermic. Cracking reactors are designed to use the heat from regeneration to preheat the feed to the reaction temperature123

6. 2 Pilot scale reactors for thermal cracking

Table 14 lists some reported studies on pilot scale reactors for catalytic cracking. It is observed that all the reactors, especially the continuous reactors and fluidized bed reactors, gave a high yield of the desired products. A continuous reactor generally gives not only a lower production cost for a large scale production but also more uniform product quality (Leevijit et al., 2008).

A schematic diagram of the fully automated thermal cracking pilot plant is shown in Fig. 11. Preheated oil feed flows into the bottom of a riser, where it is mixed with hot regenerated catalyst. The reactions take place in the riser, and at the riser exit the mixture flows into the stripper vessel where the separation of gases from the solid catalysts occurs. The solids flow through the spent catalyst lift line and return to the reactor bottom following regeneration.

7. Biofuel characteristics
For renewable fuels to be successful in the market they should have similar properties to conventional fuels.10Fuel properties for the combustion analysis of vegetable oils can be classified into chemical, physical, and thermal properties.41 Chemical properties include corrosiveness, sulfur and ash content, and acid value. Physical properties include viscosity, density, cloud point, pour point, flash point, boiling range, freezing point and refractive index. Thermal properties include Higher Heating Value (HHV) and distillation.
Gasoline qualities are usually measured in terms of volatility and octane number of the hydrocarbons. An adequate volatility is required for smooth operation of petrol engines. The light hydrocarbons (LHs) have higher volatilities than those of heavy hydrocarbons (HHc). Suitable hydrocarbons are in the C5–C8 range. According to ISO norms, fuel properties of diesel fuels are characterized by determining its flash point, viscosity, density, acid value, cetane number, cloud and pour points, distillation range, ash content, sulfur content, carbon residue, copper corrosion and HHV.41
Properties of biofuels should be comparable or better than petroleum-derived fuel in order to ensure that it can be used in an engine without any modification. Biofuel should provide engine performances similar to that obtained with petroleum-derived fuels. The following are the important characteristics of fuel.
Viscosity

Fuel viscosity plays an important role in the combustion of the fuel. Viscosity is a measure of the internal friction or resistance of oil to flow, which affects the operation of fuel injection equipment. Viscosity decreases as the temperature of oil is increased. Too low viscosity can lead to excessive internal pump leakage and will affect injection during the spray atomization, whereas high viscosity leads to poorer atomization of the fuel spray and less accurate operation of the fuel injectors. At low temperatures, increase in viscosity affects the fluidity of the fuel. Moreover, the effect of viscosity is critical at low speed or light load conditions.125,126
Vapor pressure
More volatile fuels will vaporize more readily, thus creating more pressure on the measurement device and higher readings. The vapor pressure of a fuel must be high enough to allow the engine to start easily, but not so high as to contribute to vapor lock or excessive evaporative emissions.125
Cloud point, pour point and flash point
The performance of fuels under cold temperature conditions are reflected by the cloud point and pour point. For satisfactory working, the values of both should be well below the freezing point of the oil used. These properties are used as a quality control specification or low temperature handling indicators, and will be a deciding factor if the biofuel produced can be used in cold climate countries. Fatty acids in the feedstock oil determine the cold flow properties. A higher percentage of unsaturated fatty acid in the feedstock oil tends to give better cold flow properties.9,126
Flash point: Although it is not related to engine performance, the flash point temperature of a fuel is an important from a safety point of view. It is required for legal and safety precautions in handling and storage. The flash point indicates the presence of highly flammable and volatile materials and is used to assess the overall flammability hazard of a material.29 This temperature should be as high as practically possible. Typical values of commercial vegetable oils fuel range between 323 and 383 K.126
Heating value
The Higher Heating Value (HHV) is an important property for defining the energy content, and thereby efficiency, of fuels. It is always desirable for the biofuel to have a calorific value near to that of diesel. To maximize the equipment operating range it is preferable for the calorific value of the fuel to be high, although wide variations in heating value are still accepted. The heating values of the vegetable oils and their methyl esters (biodiesels) can be calculated by using the viscosity, density and flash point obtained from simple physical measurements.41

          Sulfur content and other contaminants
The sulfur content, phosphorous, lead, carbon residue and ash are responsible for forming a residue on the engine parts and causing corrosion which will affect engine life. These values should be as small as possible to protect against engine wear and deterioration of engine oil, as well as to protect exhaust system parts and catalytic converters. The maximum values are 0.15% sulfur (ASTM D-4814), 0.0013 g l−1 phosphorous (ASTM D-4814) and 0.01% ash (ASTM D-975) (ASTM D-4814; ASTM D-975).125
Contaminant such as phosphorous, manganese, chlorine and inorganic chloride, copper content, and water content is most likely corrosive to equipment and causes problems in processing. Their presence must therefore be kept to very low levels.

Octane and cetane number
The octane and cetane numbers are a measure of the ignition quality of gasoline and diesel fuel, respectively. The higher the octane and cetane number, the easier the fuel ignites when it is injected into the engine. A higher cetane number implies a short ignition delay and also a more efficient fuel. Due to its higher oxygen content, biodiesel has a higher cetane number than petrodiesel.41

Fuel quality is measured by standardized testing methods. The standard for gasoline is outlined in ASTM D4814, as listed in Table 16.

8. Social aspects
Huge quantities of waste cooking oils and animal fats are available throughout the world, especially in developed countries. In Malaysia, an estimated 50000 tonnes per year of used frying oils, both vegetable oils and animal fats, are disposed of without treatment as waste.130 Waste vegetable oils, greases, and animal fats have already been used as feedstocks for biodiesel production. Oil feedstock cost is the major cost of biofuel production, accounting for over 70% of the total costs. Therefore, if waste vegetable oil is used as a feedstock, not only can the economics of biofuel be significantly improved, but also the waste disposal costs.
Some common physical changes were observed in used vegetable oil such as increase in viscosity and specific heat, higher tendency of fat formation, change in surface tension, and color. Despite changes in UPO chemical and physical properties as compared to fresh edible oil, both of the oil feedstocks can still be converted to biodiesel using similar methods.
The characteristics of the biogasoline produced from UPO is similar to biogasoline produced from palm oil in a microreactor, as reported in our earlierwork.32 The OLP, coke and gasoline fraction yields from UPO were still comparable with refined palm oil, even though its gaseous products were higher. These findings show that there was not much difference between UPO and palm oil in terms of desired product distributions (OLP and gasoline fraction yields).
If a proper pretreatment process is conducted before the transesterification process, the characteristics of the biodiesel produced from UPO, such as density, viscosity, sulfur content, pour point, flash point and gross heat of combustion, are found to be similar to those obtained from their respective fresh edible oil.131 However, the infrastructure and logistics of collection are major challenges in utilizing UPO as a feedstock. Further public awareness, education and acceptance are a key for successful implementation.
9. Future directions
As fossil fuel continues to decline and petroleum prices continue to increase, it is likely that biofuels will play an increasing role in our energy future. The processing of vegetable oil by catalytic cracking routes is a potential alternative for the production of biofuels. Production of biofuel through catalytic cracking on a commercial scale will depend on the availability of cheap feedstock, suitable catalysts, and catalytic reactors. The development of the processes related to the production of biogasoline is still in the early stages of research and development, while the use of biodiesel as biofuel is already commercialized using different process routes and technologies. A number of issues need to be addressed in order to commercialize biogasoline production in future biorefineries. The volume of feedstock, preferably used cooking oil or non-edible oil, must be available cheaply and in sufficient enough amounts (volume and sustainable supplies) for the biorefinery. In order to reduce the operating and the process costs, process improvements such as energy requirement and catalyst economics, is needed. An upgrading process can be applied for biofuel production based on a study by Demirbas and Karslioglu,132 where physical, catalytic and chemical upgrading could be done for products meeting the technical specifications in line with the desired fuel properties.
The production of high-quality biogasoline using suitable catalysts in a cracking process is still the main challenge of a modern concept biorefinery. The acidic cracking catalyst zeolite has shown big potential in cracking vegetable oil to produce olefins and a high yield of gasoline. Zeolite modification has been extensively studied to take full advantage of their performance. Such modification has been reported in the application of nanoscale zeolites in catalytic cracking process. Zeolite with crystal sizes smaller than 100 nm is reported to have a great catalytic performance, giving a lower coke yield, better stability and good activity. Resistance to deactivation must be investigated to develop new catalyst with optimization in porosity and acidity (type, strength and number of acid sites). However, high cost of zeolite catalysts and advance synthetic catalysts are normally one of the issues concerned with the catalyst economics. To meet this challenge, reduction in the cost of the catalyst in terms of their activity, selectivity and development of micro/mesoporous composite catalysts, and silica alumina composite catalysts with stability and long life are needed. These catalysts selectively favor the cracking reaction, producing a high yield of gasoline and olefins with a low amount of coke. Future work should focus on understanding the reaction pathways for using different types of vegetable oil based feedstocks, with the ultimate goal of designing new and improved catalysts that display higher selectivities. Catalysts which can result in high octane biogasoline, along with olefins production in a catalytic cracker, will be the most desirable requirements in future biorefineries.
Integration of a self-sustained biorefinery is one of issues which needs to be looked into through innovative technologies and continued research and development. It will be ideal if the technology can be integrated with the existing facilities present in petroleum refineries. Furthermore, integrating biofuel production processes into a biorefinery with high efficiency is required to reduce operating cost, and to eventually reduce biofuel price to make it economically viable. In spite of the same concept being utilized for the production of fuels with a biorefinery and a petroleum refinery, the nature of both processes is fundamentally different due to differences in feedstocks, and renewable and non-renewable energy sources.
The concept of an integrated biorefinery should not be limited to a catalytic process for the production of biofuels only, but should be extended to the production of olefins and other feedstocks for the downstream processing industries that currently depend on petroleum refineries and petrochemical plants for their feedstocks. Fig. 12 shows a conceptual schematic diagram, similar to a typical integrated biorefinery.
 Fig. 12  Schematic diagram of a catalytic cracker in a typical biorefinery. 
There are a number of issues, such as feedstock suitability, design of catalyst and reactor, characterization of the product and also mass production analysis, which have to be addressed and solved before bio-gasoline can be commercialized. Improving the quality of bio-gasoline should be given high priority to allow the product to be blended together with fossil fuel gasoline in a gasoline engine without modification. Moreover, sustainability is an important issue for the future of biofuels, in terms of supply of feedstock, and to make sure that these fuels are as environmentally friendly as the biofuel industry has always claimed.
10. Conclusions
The processing of oil based feedstock by catalytic cracking is a promising alternative for the future of biofuel production. Oil based feedstocks include edible oil, non-edible oil, waste edible oil, and fat. Improper production planning of edible oil could raise a problem in the economic and food sectors, therefore utilization of non-edible oil or waste oil could be a solution for this problem.
Gasoline and diesel fuel could be produced from catalytic cracking of triglycerides. Catalytic cracking of vegetable oils is a route to convert vegetable oil or waste used cooking oil into gasoline and other hydrocarbons. The yield of hydrocarbons in catalytic cracking depends on the choice of shape selective catalyst, as well as acidity of the catalyst. Microporous catalysts such as zeolites have shown great potential as cracking catalysts. However, catalyst design needs to be improved by suitable modification and optimization with the ultimate goal of new catalysts that produce higher selectivity for gasoline production.
The catalytic cracking process allows the utilization of existing infrastructure in a typical petroleum refinery which would have low capital costs. In order to commercialize the catalytic process, the quality of the biofuel produced should be comparable to petroleum derived fuel in terms of quality and price. Many options are available for the utilization of renewable feedstocks for catalytic cracking, and choosing the right type of process for the production of biofuels could lead our society towards a sustainable economy.

Broader context
Biofuels are important renewable energy sources which will substitute petroleum fuels in the near future. Catalytic cracking is one of the most efficient methods to crack renewable feedstock in the presence of catalyst to produce biofuel. Beside edible vegetable oils, non-edible and used cooking oils have received considerable attention as feedstocks for the production of biofuel. The catalytic cracking of edible and non-edible oils requires the development of proper cracking catalysts and reactors for the production of biofuel such as biogasoline. The present article summarizes progress in the development of catalytic cracking technology in the biofuel production. This review covers the feedstocks, catalysts, reactors, biofuel characteristics, research done in Malaysia in the area of biofuel, and future prospects of this technology to be implemented in the biorefinery for the production of biofuels.
