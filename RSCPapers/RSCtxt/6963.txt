    , Accepted 4th February 2022First published on 8th February 2022AbstractUsing Si-based photoelectrodes to generate H2 through photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has attracted extensive attention in recent years. To produce H2 with a high efficiency, the key issues that need to be solved are the relatively low photovoltage of the Si-based photoelectrode and the sluggish kinetics of the H2 generation reaction occurring on the surface of Si. In this study, we designed and fabricated the Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si photocathode for high-efficiency H2 generation via PEC. The theoretically lower PtSi/p-Si junction Schottky barrier height was elevated to a high value of 0.9 eV by dopant segregation, thereby obtaining a high photovoltage. Upon the electrochemical surface reconstruction of PtSi, a thin layer of Ptx(x=2,3)Si with a high catalytic activity is in situ formed on the photocathode which significantly enhances the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics. Accordingly, a favorable onset potential for HER of 0.54 V vs. RHE and a high saturated photocurrent density of 30 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE are achieved from the Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si photocathode. The applied-bias photo-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of the Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si photocathode reaches a maximum at 5.8%, which is record-high for the Si-based single junction photocathodes without a buried p–n junction. Moreover, the Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si photocathode exhibits an excellent stability in the long-term PEC H2 generation test. This work provides a new perception onto the design and construction of Si-based photocathodes with improved catalytic activity, as well as the possibility of efficient and stable PEC H2 generation.
Introduction
Using photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices to split water is regarded as a sustainable approach to produce H2 – a new green energy form since it can solve the problems associated with gradually exhausted non-renewable energy resources and environmental pollution.1,2 Silicon (Si) has been studied extensively to be utilized for PEC devices because of its appropriate band gap (Eg ≈ 1.12 eV), high charge carrier mobility and mature technology for fabrication.3 Nonetheless, there are still some issues that limit the utilization of Si for water splitting, such as the sluggish surface reaction kinetics, the low photovoltage of Si and the instability of the Si photoelectrode in aqueous electrolytes, etc.4 In order to improve the reaction kinetics of the Si surface, an effective strategy is to modify Si with the materials that have a high catalytic activity.5–8 Platinum (Pt) has been evidenced to be the most active hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst,9 and would be an ideal candidate for modification of the Si-based photocathode.10–15 However, the scarcity and high cost of Pt make it challenging for use in a large scale. Therefore, it is imperative to make the balance right in reducing the usage of Pt and achieving a high catalytic activity. Recently, platinum-based intermetallic catalysts have been reported to show excellent catalytic properties owing to the defined surface and near-surface atomic arrangement of intermetallic structure.16 Therefore, using metallic intermetallic platinum silicides would be an alternative strategy to decrease the usage of Pt while containing high catalytic property.17 Moreover, the intermetallic platinum silicides have favourable stability and could protect the Si photoelectrode from erosion in aqueous solution.18 Furthermore, its additional bonus is the photovoltage would be further enhanced through the metal–semiconductor (MS) Schottky junction formed between the intermetallic platinum silicides and Si. Higher photovoltage would have a distinct advantage in realizing highly efficient PEC H2 generation.14,19 Our previous research20 in Si-based photoelectrode materials has demonstrated that metal silicidation combining with dopant segregation (DS) is a valid strategy to fabricate the platinum silicides/Si photoelectrode which has potentially improved separation and transportation of the photo-induced carriers, elevated Schottky barrier height (SBH) and thus increased photovoltage.20–24 However, a problem should be considered during the DS of the platinum silicides/Si photoelectrode. Usually, a transitory high temperature for the DS of the platinum silicides/Si photoelectrode would induce the serious diffusion of Pt atom into the Si substrate and result in a conversion of the platinum silicides including metal-rich phase Ptx(x>1)Si to PtSi.25–27 While, among the various kinds of platinum silicides, it is the metal-rich phase Ptx(x>1)Si that has been reported to exhibit high catalytic activity.17 If a metal-rich phase Ptx(x>1)Si can be in situ reconstructed from the PtSi, the Si-based photoelectrode with high catalytic activity and photovoltage as well as stability can be anticipated for PEC H2 generation.
In this work, we designed and fabricated a Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si photocathode for achieving high PEC H2 generation performance. The PtSi/p-Si was first fabricated through a metal silicidation process. The DS was then performed to obtain 0.9 eV SBH in resultant DS-treated PtSi/p-Si junction. On the top of this, an electrochemical surface reconstruction (ESR) was performed to make a thin layer of Ptx(x=2,3)Si on the DS PtSi/p-Si. An excellent HER onset potential of 0.54 V vs. RHE and a high saturated photocurrent density of 30 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE were achieved from the Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si photocathode. The calculated applied-bias photo-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of such an Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/Si photocathode reaches a new record high value of 5.8% for the single junction Si-based photocathode without a buried p–n junction. The platinum silicide plays a critical role in protection, which makes Si-based photocathodes excellent in stability.
Results and discussion
The Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/Si photocathode was fabricated through a four-step process as illustrated in the schematic diagram of Fig. 1. A Pt film with a thickness of 8 nm was first deposited on a single crystalline p-Si (100) wafer by the radio frequency magnetron sputtering. The metal silicidation was then carried out at 550 °C/30 s to form PtSi/p-Si. In order to avoid implantation damage to as-formed PtSi film, a protective SiO2 layer was deposited on the surface of the PtSi/p-Si in advance. After that, the DS process was realized by implanting phosphorus (P) atoms into as-formed PtSi film and subsequent drive-in annealing at 700 °C/30 s in N2, and the sample was named as DS PtSi/p-Si. Next, the protective SiO2 buffer layer was removed from the DS PtSi/p-Si by the cleaning solution. Finally, such a SiO2-removed sample DS PtSi/p-Si was electrochemically treated in 1 M KOH under a positive potential of 0.9 V vs. RHE for 30 minutes, and the Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/Si photocathode was obtained. Further fabrication details about Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/Si photocathodes are presented in Experiment section.

As an Mott–Schottky (MS) junction device, the relationship of the photovoltage and the Schottky barrier height (SBH, ϕbp) of the junction is positive linear correlation.23 Therefore, the SBH of the junction was elevated through the DS process to achieve a high photovoltage.20 The SBH of the DS PtSi/p-Si was measured by solid-state cell Mott–Schottky measurement. As shown in Fig. 2a, the Mott–Schottky plot of the DS PtSi/p-Si shows an excellent linearity. The x-intercept of the linear fitting line (0.65 V) represents the flat band potential (Efb) of the DS PtSi/p-Si. Thus, the SBH (ϕbp) of the DS PtSi/p-Si can be calculated to be 0.9 eV (ESI†). The SBH of the MS junction formed by the PtSi and Si should theoretically be 0.21 eV without the DS process.28–30 With the DS treatment, this value increases approximately 0.7 eV, benefiting from the deformation of the electric field at the interface between PtSi and p-Si.31–33 The concentration distribution of the dopant P atoms in DS PtSi/p-Si was investigated by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), and the results are shown in Fig. 2b. It can be found that P atoms accumulate at the PtSi/p-Si interface. During the DS process, the P atoms previously implanted into PtSi have an opposite polarity to the substrate doping and these P atoms were accumulated ceaselessly at the interface between PtSi and p-Si to form interfacial dipoles,33 as illustrated in Fig. 2c. According to the theory of semiconductor physics, the effective SBH is determined by the electric field at the MS interface, which is influenced by interfacial dipoles and space charge.34,35 Therefore, the interfacial dipoles formed on the interface between the PtSi and p-Si would cause the energy band of the interface to bend down, and the SBH is subsequently enhanced, following the increase of the photovoltage.21,36 The DS PtSi/p-Si is still a Schottky junction rather than a pn junction.37

In order to improve the HER reaction kinetics of the photoelectrode, we employed the ESR to form a thin layer of Ptx(x>1)Si on the surface of the DS PtSi/p-Si photoelectrode (Fig. S2a†). The cross-sectional microstructures of the samples before and after ESR are presented in Fig. 3, characterized using different transmission electron microscopy (TEM), including high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) with high-angle annular dark field (HADDF) (ESI Notes†). A smooth polycrystalline film on the p-Si substrate can be observed from the DS PtSi/p-Si before ESR, in which the film thickness is about 15 nm (Fig. 3a). The lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.3 nm identified from the HRTEM image (Fig. 3b) is consistent with the PtSi (101) plane. Moreover, SiO2 is not found from the DS PtSi/p-Si, and the interface between the PtSi and p-Si is almost perfect. Fig. 3c and d show the HRTEM and HADDF-TEM images of the sample after ESR treatment, respectively. Compared with the sample before the ESR, the surface of the sample becomes rough (Fig. 3c). A brighter surface layer with a thickness of about 3 nm is observable in HADDF-TEM image (Fig. 3d) in terms of different Z-contrast, implying much more Pt atoms segregate at the surface of as-formed PtSi film. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of DS PtSi/p-Si and Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si (Fig. S6†) reveals the segregation of Pt atoms at the surface after ESR treatment. The interplanar spacings of 0.20 nm and 0.24 nm correspond to the (200) plane of Pt2Si and the (112) plane of Pt3Si, respectively. Further as illustrated in the Fig. 3d, the thickness of the PtSi was reduced to about 12 nm. While, the interface between the Ptx(x=2,3)Si and PtSi are smooth, and the perfect interface between the PtSi and p-Si is not destroyed during the ESR process. These results demonstrate that the photoelectrode consists of a sandwich structure of three crystalline layers. The surface reconstruction and the formation of Ptx(x=2,3)Si phases was also supported by the glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) characterization (Fig. S3†).

To more clearly analyze the surface compositions of the samples before and after the ESR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization (ESI Notes†) was performed. Fig. 4 shows the Pt 4f spectra. From Fig. 4a, a spin–orbit coupled doublet at 73.0 eV (Pt 4f7/2) and 76.3 eV (Pt 4f5/2) correspond to PtSi, indicating the existence of PtSi on the surface of the DS p-Si/PtSi before the ESR, which is in agreement with the observation from the HRTEM (Fig. 3b). Two XPS spin–orbit coupled doublets of Pt (4f7/2 72.5 eV, 4f5/2 75.8 eV) and (4f7/2 71.4 eV, 4f5/2 74.7 eV) can be detected from the sample after ESR, being indexed to Pt2Si and Pt3Si (Fig. 4b), respectively.38 In the Si 2p spectra (Fig. S7†), both the samples with and without ESR have two peaks at 100.5 eV and 103.5 eV, which indicates the existence of Si–Pt bonds and SiO2.38 These observations are in accordance with the characterization from the HADDF-TEM (Fig. 3d). Therefore, these results from the XPS further demonstrate that a thin layer of the Ptx(x=2,3)Si (a mixture of Pt2Si and Pt3Si) is formed on the surface of the PtSi through the ESR, and the whole photoelectrode indeed forms a sandwich structure of Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si.

Based on the structure characterization data on the samples prepared at different stages, the formation of the Ptx(x=2,3)Si during the ESR could be illustrated in the schematic diagram of Fig. 5. First, under the positive potential of ESR, the Si atoms on the surface of the PtSi were electrochemically oxidized to silicon oxides (SiOx) through breaking the Pt–Si bonds and subsequently forming the Si–O bonds with the hydroxyl in the electrolyte.39 Then, the as-formed SiOx was chemically dissolved by KOH in the electrolyte.40 With the persistent break of the Pt–Si bonds and dissolution of the SiOx during the ESR process, the Si atoms on the surface of the PtSi would be ceaselessly consumed. Consequently, the proportion of the Pt atoms to Si atoms on the surface of the PtSi film would increase significantly. During this process, a lot of defects (dangling bonds) would be produced on the surface of the film and the structure of the PtSi on the surface would be subsequently destroyed.27 Thus, the occurrence of surface reconstruction gives rise to platinum-rich phases of Pt2Si and Pt3Si.41 Finally a thin layer of the Ptx(x=2,3)Si was formed on the surface of PtSi. The process of PtSi reconstructed to Ptx(x=2,3)Si during the electrochemical oxidation was similar to the course of the SiO2 layer and metal-rich phases formation on the silicides using thermal oxidation.42

To investigate the electrocatalytic activity of the PtSi and Ptx(x=2,3)Si for HER, an electrode holder of Pt foil was directly clamped to the surface of the PtSi or Ptx(x=2,3)Si as working electrode (Fig. S2b and c†). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves without iR compensation were conducted in 0.5 M H2SO4 as shown in Fig. 6a. The LSV curve of the PtSi (black) shows that the current density is very small in the test potential range, indicating a very poor HER electrocatalytic activity of the PtSi. However, from the LSV curve of the Ptx(x=2,3)Si (red), it is evidently found that the current density is much larger when it is measured at the same potential, indicating that the Ptx(x=2,3)Si has a better H2 evolution electrocatalysis performance than the PtSi. It is notable that only a potential of 180 mV is needed for the Ptx(x=2,3)Si to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−2, being close to that of the best HER Pt catalyst.43 In addition, compared with our recently reported Pt NP/NiSi2/p-Si electrode,44 the Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si electrode exhibited a much higher mass electrochemical activity (Fig. S8†) towards HER. Furthermore, the Tafel plots of the PtSi and Ptx(x=2,3)Si were investigated to gain insight into the reaction occurring at the surfaces. In Fig. 6b, it can be seen that the Tafel slope of 89.1 mV dec−1 achieved from the Ptx(x=2,3)Si is much smaller than that from the PtSi (179.2 mV dec−1), implying that a more rapid HER kinetic process occurred on the surface of the Ptx(x=2,3)Si.17 Given these electrochemical properties achieved from the Ptx(x=2,3)Si, it could be concluded that the Ptx(x=2,3)Si has a significant electrocatalytic activity for HER.

The high HER electrocatalytic activity of the Ptx(x=2,3)Si would be beneficial for an efficient PEC H2 generation from water through the Ptx(x=2,3)Si/p-Si/PtSi photocathode. Hence, the Ptx(x=2,3)Si/p-Si/PtSi as the photocathode was assembled to a homemade electrode holder and tested in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte under simulated AM 1.5 condition (Fig. S2d†). For comparison, the PEC performances of the PtSi/p-Si and DS PtSi/p-Si were also investigated at the same experimental condition. The LSV were performed without iR compensation, and the results are shown in Fig. 7a. For photocathodes, the onset potential of the PtSi/p-Si photocathode (red line) is very negative and the photocurrent is almost 0 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE, indicating its extremely poor photoelectrochemical HER performance. This would result from the PtSi/p-Si photocathode which the photovoltage is near 0 mV (Fig. S4†). Similarly, the Pt/p-Si (15 nm Pt on the p-Si) shows almost no photoresponse (Fig. S4 and S9†). However, the onset potential of the DS PtSi/p-Si photocathode (blue line in Fig. 7a) is positively shifted because of the high photovoltage of 390 mV (Fig. S4†), arising from the enhanced SBH by the DS process. Unfortunately, only a very small photocurrent density of about 1.2 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE is obtained from the DS PtSi/p-Si photocathode own to the poor HER electrocatalytic activity of the PtSi on the surface as demonstrated above. From the performance of the Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si photocathode (green line in Fig. 7a), we can get the onset potential of as high as 0.54 V vs. RHE (at 0.1 mA cm−2) for HER and a saturated photocurrent density of 30 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE. Moreover, the applied-bias photo-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of the Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si photocathode is deduced from the expression described in ESI notes,† which is 5.8% of ABPE (Fig. 7a). This is a new record value of ABPE for single junction Si-based photocathode structure without buried p–n junction (ESI Table†). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si reached the highest value of 29% at 850 nm, as shown in Fig. S10a.† The excellent photoelectrochemical property of Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si could be partially attributed to the less recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes due to the fast carrier transport, which was supported by the EIS analysis (Fig. S10b†). In addition, the PEC stability of the Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si photocathode was investigated by chronoamperometry at −0.056 V vs. RHE in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution under the illumination of AM 1.5. As shown in Fig. 7b, little decay can be observed from the photocurrent over the entire 48 hours of continuous testing, indicating that the stability of the Ptx(x=2,3)Si is high enough to admirably protect the photocathode in acid electrolytes. And we also conducted the chronoamperometry of Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si in the same condition with a drainage system to measure the generated gas (Fig. S10c†). As shown in Fig. S10d,† the theoretically calculated volume and the measured volume of gas are in great coincidence. And the Faraday efficiencies of Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si during the test were calculated, indicating that Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si has a high Faraday efficiency for PEC H2 generation.

Conclusions
In summary, we provide and successfully demonstrate a feasible strategy to fabricate the Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si photocathode for high efficiency PEC H2 generation from water, in which the platinum silicide substituted platinum to economically and efficiently elevate the catalytic kinetics and SBH through the formation of platinum-rich phase Ptx(x>1)Si and the DS process. The Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si photocathode achieved an onset potential of 0.54 V vs. RHE, a high saturated photocurrent density of 30 mA cm−2 at the 0 V vs. RHE, and a high ABPE of 5.8% for HER. The long-term operational test shows the excellent stability of the photocathode. The strategy we developed in this work combines metal silicidation and dopant segregation with electrochemical surface reconstruction, enabling to fabricate economically high-performance silicon-based photoelectrodes. In this way, a rational balance of noble metal catalysts utilization and catalytic properties is realized.
Experimental section
Preparation of PtSi/p-Si
A p-type Si (100) wafers (8–12 Ω cm) were first soaked in the RCA SC-1 procedure solution (NH4OH, H2O2, H2O, 1:1:5 by volume) for 10 minutes at 75 °C and then cleaned by the RCA SC-3 procedure solution (H2SO4, H2O2, 3:1 volume ratio) for 15 minutes at 120 °C. Afterwards, the wafers were plunged into the solution (HF, H2O, 1:100) for 10 seconds to vanish the natural oxide layer on the surface. Then, the wafers were laved thoroughly by deionized water and dried in N2 using a commercial spin rinse dryer. Such p-Si wafers were displaced to a magnetron sputtering chamber (ULVAC-SME200) immediately. Pt was deposited on the cleaned p-Si wafer by radio frequency magnetron sputtering at 0.2318 nm s−1. The thickness of the Pt layer on the p-Si was 8 nm. Then the p-Si wafer with Pt layer was annealed at 550 °C in N2 protective gas for 30 seconds with a heating rate of 30 °C s−1 using rapid thermal processing (RTP) equipment (As-Master) to acquire the PtSi/p-Si.
Dopant segregation (DS)
Phosphorus (P) ions were chosen as the implanted dopants to optimize the PtSi/p-Si photocathode. Before the ion implantation process, a SiO2 layer was deposited on the PtSi film with a thickness of 50 nm by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD, AMAT P5000) at 400 °C as a buffer layer. Then, P ions were implanted into the PtSi film with a dose of 1 × 1015 cm−2 at 39 keV by ion implanter tool (AMAT E500HP). Next, the PtSi/p-Si substrate with SiO2 buffer layer was drive-in annealed at 700 °C in N2 protective gas for 30 seconds with a heating rate of 30 °C s−1 to drive the P dopants to the interface of PtSi/p-Si. Finally, the sample was soaked in a cleaning solution (HF, H2O 1:100) to remove the SiO2 layer under the monitoring of sample sheet resistance and acquired the DS PtSi/p-Si.
Electrochemical surface reconstruction (ESR)
The DS PtSi/p-Si samples were assembled to a homemade photoelectrode holder before the electrochemical surface reconstruction (ESR). First, an ohmic contact of the sample back was created by covering an InGa eutectic layer. And a Cu foil was laid on the top of an InGa eutectic layer to conduct the electric current. Then the photocathode was placed in the photoelectrode holder with an exposed area of 0.38 cm2. The DS PtSi/Si served as the working electrode while a Pt net electrode and a Hg/HgO electrode were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The ESR process was performed in 1 M KOH solution by chronopotentiometry at 0.01 mA for 30 minutes (Fig. S2a and S5†).
Electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements
The electrochemical (EC) properties of PtSi and Ptx(x=2,3)Si were measured by a CHI660C workstation in a three-electrode system. The 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. High purity argon was pumped into the solution for 30 minutes before each measurement and the solution was magnetic stirred during the measurements. The working electrode was directly contacted with the PtSi or Ptx(x=2,3)Si film using a platinum electrode holder.45 Both the samples were fixed reaction area of 0.25 cm2 with epoxy glue (Fig. S2a and c†). A graphite rod electrode (6 mm) and an SCE electrode were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. For the PEC measurements, the photocathodes were assembled to a homemade electrode holder as the process was mentioned above. The PEC performances were measured as a working electrode in the same environment as EC measurements. Meanwhile, the photocathode was illuminated with a 100 mW cm−2 light intensity using a 500 W xenon lamp through an AM 1.5 filter. The scan rates of all the CV and LSV curves were 100 mV s−1. And the data of the CV, LSV, and chronoamperometry measurements were acquired without any iR compensation. The chronoamperometry was performed at −0.056 V vs. RHE (−0.3 V vs. SCE)23 (Fig. S2d†).
