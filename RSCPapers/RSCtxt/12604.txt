    , Accepted 7th June 2023First published on 9th June 2023AbstractNoble-metal free and durable electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction and evolution reactions are crucial to achieving a high-performance rechargeable Zn–air battery. Herein, a bifunctional electrocatalyst with a dual-protected structure has been successfully fabricated. The obtained materials, i.e., Co@PPD_rGO, showed good ORR and OER performances. As a proof-of-concept application, Co@PPD_rGO was employed in the rechargeable Zn–air battery. It showed lower charge and discharge voltages compared with Pt/C under the same conditions. It should be noted that a voltage degradation is observed on Co@PPD_rGO after 350 cycles. These good performances originate from its 3D porous structure, dual protection from PPD and rGO, high specific surface area, small charge transfer resistance, the N/Co-doping effect and synergistic interaction between Co@PPD and rGO. This strategy reported herein may pave a way for designing efficient electrocatalysts toward Zn–air batteries using other dual-protected MOF materials.
1. Introduction
Owing to the growing overexploitation of nonrenewable fossil fuels and rising environmental problems, there is an urgent demand for sustainable electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies.1,2 Among the popular green and effective technologies, including metal–air batteries, lithium-ion batteries, solar power batteries and fuel cells, the rechargeable zinc–air battery (ZAB) has attracted great attention for its high transformation efficiency, large energy density (1084 W h kg−1, including oxygen),3 abundant raw resources, low cost ($10 kW h−1), environment friendliness and safe operation.1–3 Despite all those above advantages, there are roadblocks in the large-scale commercialization of rechargeable ZABs. One of the fundamental problems is the intrinsic sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during the discharging process and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) during the charging process.2 Therefore, the key factor to the development of a rechargeable ZAB is the highly active electrocatalysts. Currently, the noble Pt/C for ORR and IrO2 and RuO2 for OER are considered as the most effective electrocatalysts.3,4 However, their high cost, scarcity, and instability in harsh alkaline conditions largely restrict their use for renewable energy technologies. Moreover, Pt-based catalysts exhibit unfavorable OER activity due to the formation of nonconductive oxide layers at high potential.5 Further, IrO2 and RuO2 exhibit excellent OER activity, but they are inert for ORR.2 Therefore, either Pt-based catalysts or IrO2 or RuO2 are not suitable for the rechargeable ZAB. Therefore, the rational design and development of a cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalyst with high durability is of great significance for the development of rechargeable ZABs, while it is challenging at the same time.4
Currently, different nonprecious-metal-based catalysts including Fe3C quantum dots and N-doped graphene carbon (Fe3C–NG),6 3D carbon nanosheets aggregate with highly branched carbon nanotubes and cobalt active sites (CoCNTs/PNAs),7 metal–organic framework-based mixed conductors,8 porphyrin covalent organic framework (POF),9 Co/MoC-nanoparticles embedded N-doped carbon,10 three-dimensional S,N co-doped ZIF-67,11 MOF-derived Co-MOF, and O-doped carbon12 have been successfully obtained and shown excellent catalytic activities. Among them, Co nanoparticles encased in nitrogen-doped carbon (Co@NC) are emerging as a promising alternative to the traditional catalysts.1,13,14 It is believed that the inner Co nanoparticles and the electronic modulation of the carbon shells by N doping enhance its activity. However, during charging, the large applied voltage (>2.0 V) electrochemically oxidizes any unprotected Co nanoparticles or low-graphitized carbon. Consequently, it will cause a significant loss of Co@NC active sites, and thus affect the long-term stability of the above electrocatalysis penalty in battery performance,13 which is another fundamental requirement for a practical battery besides the high activity. Moreover, the practical applications of Co-based catalysts are limited by their poor electric conductivity.2,4,13,15–17 In addition, the inevitable agglomeration and the exposure of Co nanoparticles existed in the electrocatalyst due to their highly reactive nature in the synthesis process under high temperature.14 Therefore, it is necessary and effective for the rechargeable ZAB with a long cycling life to fabricate well-protected Co@NC catalysts with uniformly distributed metallic nanoparticles and high conductivity.
One effective method for overcoming the above problems is combining the conductive matrix and protective materials. Some novel substrates, including carbon cloth,18 cellulose aerogel,19 carbon nanotube,4,20 polypyrrole21 and graphene,16,17,22–28 have been applied to construct active materials with large surface areas for electrochemical reactions, which are considered as one of the most promising bifunctional electrocatalysts. It should be noted that the Co center growing on the graphene matrix is beneficial to catalyze the growth of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) for suppressing the aggregation of metal particles at high temperature.4 At the same time, the addition of graphene oxides not only enhances the electrical conductivity of the electrocatalyst, but also facilitates the electron transfer for ORR/OER. Therefore, the exceptional design of highly active, durable bifunctional active sites in a suitable electrode architecture with a prompt mass/charge transfer is required for the rechargeable ZAB.
Herein, uniformly distributed Co nanoparticles completely enclosed in a few well-graphitized pyrolyzed polydopamine (PPD) carbon layers and anchored on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been successfully obtained. The representative structure (Co@PPD_rGO) exhibits superior bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for both ORR and OER. Simultaneously, the unique feature of the Co@PPD_rGO double protected by well-graphitized carbon shells and an anchoring rGO endows the ZAB with a long cycling life with negligible performance degradation for more than 350 cycles. These results suggest that the Co@PPD_rGO prepared by the present strategy may be practically applied in rechargeable ZABs and other energy-related devices.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals and materials
Cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 99.9%), tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) (99.9%), dopamine hydrochloride (98%), graphene oxide (10 mg mL−1, dispersion in water, TCI), Nafion 117 solution (5 wt%, Sigma), potassium hydroxide (99.9%, Sigma), 20 wt% platinum supported on Vulcan XC-72 carbon (Pt/C, E-Tek) and 20 wt% iridium oxide on Vulcan XC-72 carbon (IrO2/C, Premetek) were used as received. The aqueous solutions in this work were prepared from ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm, obtained from a Milli Q Plus water purification system (Millipore, USA).
2.2. Preparation of Co@PPD_rGO, Co@PPD and rGO
Dopamine (0.06 g) was dissolved in Tris-buffer (60 mL, pH 8.5) to form a clear solution, which was added into Co(NO3)2 aqueous solution (4.5 mL, 0.2 M) dropwise while stirring. After stirring for 2 h, a graphene oxide aqueous solution (20 mL, 1.5 mg mL−1) was added into the above solution dropwise, which was kept stirring for 24 h at room temperature. Then, the reaction mixture was transferred into a 200 mL autoclave to react for another 3 h under hydrothermal condition at 150 °C. After cooling down to room temperature, the precipitates were collected via centrifugation and washed thoroughly with ultrapure water. After freeze-drying, the resultant powder was calcined by heating it up to 900 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under nitrogen flow and maintained at 900 °C for 1 h. After cooling down to room temperature, Co@PPD_rGO was formed. As control, pure PPD was synthesized following the same procedure except the addition of Co(NO3)2. Co@PPD was prepared using the same procedure and experimental conditions, except the addition of graphene oxide aqueous solution. In addition, graphene oxide was reduced under hydrothermal condition at 150 °C to get reduced graphene oxide (rGO).
2.3. Characterization
The crystal phase structure of Co@PPD_rGO was studied using a Bruker D8 advanced diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å). The surface morphology was characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL JSM7600F) operating at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. The fine nanostructure was characterized by a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL, JSM-2010) operating at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. The elements and their status in the sample were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation (VGESCALAB 200i-XL). The graphitic structure was evidenced by Raman spectra collected under a Renishawin Via confocal Raman microscope with a 532 nm laser.
2.4. Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical measurements were carried out on an Autolab PGSTAT302N (Metrohm) using a three-electrode cell configuration. Glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 5 mm in diameter), platinum foil (Pt) and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. All electrode potentials in this study refer to RHE by ERHE = ESCE + 0.990 V (0.1 M KOH) or ERHE = ESCE + 1.051 V (1 M KOH). To form a catalyst ink, 13 mg of catalyst and 65 μL of 5 wt% Nafion aqueous solution were dispersed in 2.4 mL of water/isopropanol (v/v, 2.5:1) mixed solvent by sonication for 2 h. A volume of 10 μL of the catalyst ink was applied to a glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE) and allowed to dry in the air, giving a catalyst loading of 0.25 mg cm−2. The benchmark catalyst inks of commercial Pt/C or IrO2/C were prepared in the following way. Into 1 mL of water/isopropanol (v/v, 2.5:1) mixed solvent, 4 mg of a catalyst and 13 μL 5 wt% Nafion aqueous solution were combined by sonication for 30 min. 5 μL of such ink was pipetted onto a GCE, resulting in a catalyst loading of 0.1 mg cm−2. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) profiles were obtained in N2- or O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Before the scanning, high-purity N2 or O2 was used to purge 0.1 M KOH for 30 min to achieve the O2-free or O2-saturated electrolyte solution, respectively.
In ORR experiments, 0.1 M aqueous solution of KOH was universally used as the electrolyte. High-purity O2 was used to purge the solution for 30 min to achieve the O2-saturated electrolyte solution prior to the start of the experiment, respectively. During the measurement, the flow of high-purity O2 was maintained over the electrolyte in order to ensure the O2 saturation. The rotating rate increased from 400 to 2500 rpm in an O2-saturated electrolyte at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1.
The number of transferred electrons (n) per O2 molecule in the ORR and kinetic current density was calculated from the Koutecky–Levich equations: (1) B = 0.2nFC0(D0)2/3v−1/6(2) JK = nFkC0(3)where J is the measured current density, JK and JL are the kinetic- and diffusion-limiting current densities, respectively; ω is the angular velocity of the disk (ω = 2πN, N is the linear rotation speed), n is the number of electrons transferred in ORR, F is the Faraday constant (F = 96485 C mol−1), C0 is the bulk concentration of O2 (C0 = 1.2 × 10−6 mol cm−3), D0 is the diffusion coefficient of O2 in 0.1 M KOH (D0 = 1.9 × 10−5 cm2 s−1), and v is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte (v = 0.01 cm2 s−1). The constant of 0.2 is adopted when the rotation rate is expressed in rpm.
The generated peroxide ion content during ORR was determined by a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) that was set up with an E7R9 AFE7R9GCPT tip (Pine Instruments). The RRDE electrode experiment was carried out at a rotating rate of 1600 rpm. The formation of peroxide ions (HO2−) and n during the ORR can be calculated according to the following equations: (4) n = 4ID/(ID + IR/N)(5)where Xperoxide, ID, IR and N are the percentage of HO2− formed, the disk current, ring current, and current collection efficiency of RRDE, respectively. N was calibrated using degassed 0.1 M NaOH with 0.01 M K3Fe(CN)6 at an electrode rotating speed of 1600 rpm and a potential scanning rate of 5 mV s−1 (Fig. S1, ESI†). The calculated N is 38.8 ± 0.2%, which is close to the manufacturer's data (37%).
Liner sweep voltammograms for OER were obtained in 1 M KOH at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with a rotating speed of 1600 rpm. The solution resistance was determined by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique.
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was collected at an open circuit potential with a frequency range from 105 to 0.01 Hz and an amplitude of 5 mV.
2.5. Rechargeable Zn–air battery (ZAB) assembly and tests
The performance of the rechargeable ZAB was tested in a home-built electrochemical cell (Fig. 6a). A two-electrode configuration was used by pairing a Co@PPD_rGO loaded carbon paper electrode (1.26 cm2 loaded with 1.26 mg catalyst for the cell charge–discharged at 2 mA cm−2) with a Zn plate in the electrolyte (0.2 M zinc chloride in 6 M KOH). Using Pt/C-and IrO2/C as the active materials of the cathode with similar catalyst loading to replace the Co@PPD_rGO-loaded carbon paper electrode, the benchmarking ZAB cells were also constructed and tested under the same experimental conditions.
3. Results and discussion
The typical synthesis of Co@PPD_rGO is shown in Scheme 1. In brief, Co@PPD_rGO was prepared through a hydrothermal method (See details in the Experimental section). As shown in Scheme 1, dopamine, purple Co precursor solution and black graphene oxide solutions were mixed together at room temperature. In the tris(hydroxylmethyl)aminomethane solution (pH 8.5), dopamine undergoes self-polymerization to form polydopamine (PDA) at room temperature.29 After that, the functional groups of catechol and N–H on PDA form coordination bonds with Co2+ in the mixture solution (Scheme 1a), which produces a uniform Co(II)-PDA composite as a versatile precursor for in situ nucleation and growth of Co NPs,30 and anchor on the GO support to obtain the black aggregation. Under solvothermal condition (Scheme 1b), Co(II) is reduced to Co(0) to form Co@PDA_rGO,31 and Co nanoparticles are coated with the PDA layer to obtain the black precipitation. After the pyrolysis at 900 °C, the PDA layer is carbonized into pyrolyzed polydopamine (PPD). Thus, the Co nanoparticles are encapsulated with the cross-linked indolequinone units being converted to graphitic C–N structure concurrently (Scheme 1a), which is a black powder. Consequently, dual-protected Co@PPD_rGO core@bishell nanomaterials were successfully fabricated.

The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of Co@PDA_rGO and Co@PPD_rGO are shown in Fig. 1a and b. After the pyrolysis, the white nanoparticles were incorporated into the rGO matrix to form a three-dimensional porous structure. It is obvious that the porous structure comes from the ultrathin rGO sheets, which are linked with each other. Compared with Co@PDA_rGO (Fig. 1a), the high-density isolated white nanoparticles were embedded homogeneously in the rGO matrix. They were confirmed to be Co nanoparticles in the following XRD and XPS results (Fig. 3), which can be seen clearly after pyrolysis (Fig. 1b). It might be because of the formation of PPD after pyrolysis of PDA, which increased the conductivity of Co@PPD_rGO. It should be noted that the Co nanoparticles stay apart from each other in the rGO matrix, confirming the successful mitigation in the agglomeration of free particles, as proposed in Scheme 1. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping was also performed (Fig. 1c). A typical EDS spectrum indicated that the C, Co, N and O elements are uniformly distributed in Co@PPD_rGO. This observation was also verified by our XPS results, which will be discussed in detail later (Fig. 3).

The well-dispersed Co nanoparticles inside the rGO matrix can be clearly seen in the transmission electron microscope (TEM) image (Fig. 2a). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of a single nanoparticle (Fig. 2b and c) indicate that the Co nanoparticles were wrapped with the carbon layers, which will be confirmed by the HRTEM result shown in Fig. 2c. The fringes with distances of 0.349 and 0.201 nm correspond to the d-spacing of the (002) plane of graphitic carbon and the (111) plane of the Co crystal, respectively. The carbon shell probably originates from the pyrolysis of the coated PDA layer in the presence of Co NPs.32 Such graphite shell coating on the metal will probably improve the electric conductivity and enhance the catalytic activity of the Co metal.13 The high degree graphitization in PPD was also confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, which is a sensitive tool for characterization of graphitic carbons. As shown in Fig. 2d, the Raman spectrum of Co@PPD_rGO exhibits two feature peaks at 1350 and 1590 cm−1, which correspond to the D (disordered carbon) and G (graphitic carbon) bands, respectively. Co@PPD_rGO shows a larger ratio of IG/ID than Co@PDA_rGO, indicating a higher graphitization degree and electrical conductivity of Co@PPD_rGO after the pyrolysis. Additionally, a weak D band implies the existence of defects introduced by N-doping and/or the incorporation of pentagons/heptagons in graphitic planes during the graphitization of PDA (Scheme 1a).14 In addition, it may enhance the ORR electrocatalytic activity of Co@PPD_rGO through the doping of the PPD film with the N atoms of higher content without compromising its electric conductivity,14 which will be improved by the ORR results (Fig. 4).

The structure of Co@PPD_rGO was revealed by its X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 3a) with its close-to-surface chemical composition being determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 3b–d). It is observed that the diffraction peaks at 42.4, 51.5 and 75.8° in Co@PPD_rGO can be attributed to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of metallic Co (JCPDS No.: 15-0806), respectively (Fig. 3a). It is consistent with the HRTEM result (Fig. 2c). Compared with the XRD result of Co@Co3O4@PPD (Fig. S2a, ESI†), it can be seen that the Co3O4 diffraction peaks do not appear in the XRD result of Co@PPD_rGO. It means that the Co nanoparticles were not easily oxidized in the air. This might be because of the dual protections from the PPD and rGO since the difference between these two materials lies in the single or dual protections for the Co nanoparticles. Additionally, a broad peak located at 26.3° is the (002) plane of graphitic carbon (JCPDS No.: 41-1487) (Fig. 3a). Therefore, the C and Co diffraction peaks comprise the XRD pattern of Co@PPD_rGO. The XPS spectra revealed that C, Co, N and O coexist in Co@PPD_rGO (Fig. 3b). The O contents in Co@PPD_rGO and Co@Co3O4@PPD are 0.01 and 21.1 atom%, respectively (Fig. 3b and Fig. S2b, ESI†). This result is consistent with the XRD result (Fig. 3a), confirming the useful protection of the dual layers. The deconvoluted Co 2p profile accounts for Co0, Co2+ and Co3+ (Fig. 3c).33 Therefore, the different constituents including Co and Co3O4 coexisted in the final product, which is consistent with the XRD result (Fig. 3a). The binding energies of 780 and 795 eV can be ascribed to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively. The N content in Co@PPD_rGO in Fig. 3d is 6.97 atom%, which confirms that PDA has successfully formed through the path shown in Scheme 1. The resolved N 1s reveals the presence of graphitic N (400.8 eV) and pyridinic N (398.2 eV), confirming the existence of C–N bonds.20 Consequently, Co@PPD_rGO might probably show excellent cycling stability since pyridinic N can enhance the superficial wettability of carbon materials in aqueous electrolytes.20

The electrocatalytic performances of Co@PPD_rGO towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were carried out in 0.1 M KOH solution, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. A well-defined cathodic peak for ORR appeared at 0.76 V in the O2-saturated KOH solution. However, there is no reduction peak in the N2-saturated KOH solution (Fig. 4a). Consequently, Co@PPD_rGO showed a distinguished catalytic performance towards O2. To gain insight into the electrocatalytic behaviors of Co@PPD_rGO towards ORR, the rotating valtammograms of PPD, rGO, Co@PPD, Co@PPD_rGO and commercial Pt catalyst (30 wt% platinum supported on Vulcan XC-72 carbon (Pt/C)) were tested under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 4b). It can be seen that two oxygen reduction waves appear on the PPD and rGO-modified electrode, which resulted from the two-electron reduction process of O2 to HO2−, followed by the reduction of HO2− to OH− in the 0.1 M KOH solution.14 However, only one peak appears on the Co@PPD, Co@PPD_rGO and Pt/C modified electrodes. The different results show that the ORR processes of Co@PPD, Co@PPD_rGO and Pt/C are not the same to that of PPD and rGO. Moreover, the onset potentials for ORR at PPD, rGO and Co@PPD exist at 0.74 V, 0.85 V and 0.91 V, respectively. It should be noted that the onset potential for Co@PPD_rGO and Pt/C are about at 0.93 V, which are almost the same. In addition, the current density of Co@PPD_rGO is much higher than that of PPD, rGO and Co@PPD from 0.3 V to 0.8 V. Consequently, Co@PPD_rGO shows the best activity towards ORR among PPD, rGO and Co@PPD, which probably arose from the synergetic chemical coupling effect between Co@PPD and rGO.28 In order to gain further insight into the electron transfer kinetics of Co@PPD_rGO during the ORR, the rotating disk voltammetry at different rotating rates was recorded (Fig. 4c). Obviously, the current density (J) of Co@PPD_rGO increases with the rotation speed (ω) increasing from 400 to 2500 rpm. The Koutecky–Levich plots (inset of Fig. 4c) were obtained from the data in Fig. 4c to check the relationship between J−1 and ω−1/2. It can be seen that the plots at different potentials show good linearity and parallelism in the range from 0.3 V to 0.8 V. Therefore, it is concluded that typical first-order reaction kinetics with respect to the concentration of dissolved O2 existed in the ORR catalyzed by Co@PPD_rGO. In addition, the number of transferred electrons (n) can be calculated from the above plots based on the Koutechy–Levich equation (see details in the Experimental). Clearly, the n of Co@PPD_rGO ranges from 3.7 to 3.8 (Fig. S3, ESI†), which means that the ORR process of Co@PPD_rGO is dominated by a four-electron process. On the other hand, the electrochemical test was carried out using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) to assess the n of Co@PPD_rGO (Fig. 4d). From the typical sweeping voltammogram curve obtained at a rotating speed of 1600 rpm, it can be seen that the measured HO2− yields are below 10% for Co@PPD_rGO over the potential range from 0.2 V to 0.85 V (Fig. S4, ESI†). The corresponding n of Co@PPD_rGO ranged from 3.55 to 3.85 (inset of Fig. 4d), which is consistent with the results calculated from the K–L plots of RDE measurements (inset of Fig. 4c). Consequently, Co@PPD_rGO dominated a pseudo 4-electron reaction pathway.

(f) Chronoamperometric response of Co@PPD_rGO and Pt/C upon the addition of CH3OH into O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH at 0.7 V. The final concentration of CH3OH is 3 M. 
The durability of Co@PPD_rGO was evaluated by the chronoamperometric technique, and was compared with benchmark Pt/C as a control sample. It can be seen that the current of Pt/C was lost rapidly at the initial stage of discharge. However, the sudden drop does not happen to Co@PPD_rGO (Fig. 4e). Over a similar time length, the total current loss of Pt/C and Co@PPD_rGO is 28% and 4%, respectively. It is clear that the stability of Co@PPD_rGO is better than that of commercial Pt/C. Since Pt nanoparticles are prone to be detached from the carbon support or aggregate in alkaline medium,34 the rapid current loss for Pt/C at its initial stage is understandable. However, Co@PPD_rGO has a unique structure to avoid the current loss. In Co@PPD_rGO, the Co nanoparticles were fully covered with the PPD and rGO layers (Fig. 2a–c), which can protect the Co nanoparticles from the alkaline medium and thus improve their stability. Therefore, the current loss of Co@PPD_rGO was rather slow compared to that of Pt/C.
In order to explore the application of Co@PPD_rGO in metal–air batteries, its oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activities for the charge reaction were investigated (Fig. 5). In order to remove the generated oxygen bubbles, the rotating rate was maintained at 1600 rpm during the measurements. The obtained linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the materials are shown in Fig. 5a. It is obvious that Co@PPD_rGO shows reasonable OER activity among the as-synthesized nanomaterials, although it was not as good as that of IrO2. The stability of Co@PPD_rGO was assessed using repeated potential cycling for 1000 cycles (Fig. 5b). It shows that the OER curves of Co@PPD_rGO before and after 1000 cycles almost overlaps. These good performances come from the synergetic effect between Co@PPD and rGO and the good conductivity of Co@PPD_rGO,28 which can be approved by the EIS results (Fig. 5c). The EIS demonstrates the conductivity of PPD, rGO, Co@PPD and Co@PPD_rGO. Obviously, Co@PPD_rGO has the smallest semicircular diameter compared with other catalysts, which indicates that Co@PPD_rGO has the smallest Rct value and highest catalytic activity. This is in good agreement with the ORR (Fig. 4b) and OER (Fig. 5a) results. The addition of Co nanoparticles also increases the conductivity of PPD greatly. It should be noted that the presence of rGO improves the conductivity of Co@PPD_rGO. Moreover, the anchored rGO in the Co@PPD_rGO structure improved its activity and durability.13 At last, the presence of doped nitrogen in Co@PPD_rGO and the interaction between Co nanoparticles and highly graphitized carbon layer probably improved the catalytic activity of Co@PPD_rGO. Specially, the dual protections of Co nanoparticles by PPD and rGO greatly improved its stability. These results indicate that the Co nanoparticles, rGO and PPD are the active sites of Co@PPD_rGO. In a word, the above good performances of ORR and OER of Co@PPD_rGO suggest its promising application in Zn–air batteries.

As a proof-of-concept application, Co@PPD_rGO was employed as an air catalyst used in a rechargeable Zn–air battery. A Co@PPD_rGO-loaded carbon fiber paper, a thin Zn plate and zinc chloride (0.2 M) in 6 M KOH were used as the air cathode, anode and electrolyte, respectively, in the Zn–air battery (Fig. 6a). Pt/C and IrO2/C were also tested under the same conditions to provide a benchmark value. It is obvious that the battery exhibited cycling stability when charged and discharged at 2 mA cm−2 with 30 min as one cycle time (Fig. 6b). The battery containing Co@PPD_rGO exhibited lower charge and discharge voltage than Pt/C and IrO2/C. It should be noted that significant voltage degradation occurs on Pt/C and IrO2/C after tens of cycles. However, a tiny amount of voltage degradation is observed on Co@PPD_rGO after 350 cycles (Fig. 6b), indicating the much better durability for Co@PPD_rGO. These good performances might arise from the good ORR and OER activity of Co@PPD_rGO compared with Pt/C and IrO2/C (Fig. 4 and 5).

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, Co@PPD_rGO with its unique core-shell structure has been successfully fabricated. Co nanoparticles were fully covered with PPD and rGO, which effectively prevented the Co nanoparticles from corrosion and oxidation. Therefore, Co@PPD_rGO possessed high crystallinity, good conductivity and stability. Consequently, Co@PPD_rGO showed good ORR and OER performances. As a proof-of-concept application, Co@PPD_rGO was employed in the rechargeable Zn–air battery. It showed lower charge and discharge voltages compared with Pt/C under the same conditions. It should be noted that a tiny amount of voltage degradation is observed on Co@PPD_rGO after 350 cycles. These good performances originate from its porous structure, dual protection from PPD and rGO, high specific surface area, small charge transfer resistance, the N/Co-doping effect and synergistic interaction between Co@PPD and rGO. This strategy reported herein may pave a way for designing efficient electrocatalysts toward Zn–air batteries using other dual-protected MOF materials.
