    , Accepted 6th August 2012First published on 9th August 2012AbstractDeposition of nanocrystalline Sb2S3 onto a mesoporous TiO2 photoanode is an important process in the fabrication of Sb2S3-sensitized solar cells. In order to generate oxide-free nanosized Sb2S3, a single-source precursor for the chemical bath deposition of Sb2S3 in nonaqueous media, Sb(III)(thioacetamide)2Cl3, was synthesized and used to produce high-quality Sb2S3 for solar cells.
To date inorganic semiconductors or quantum dots (QDs) have been considered as promising candidates for replacing conventional Ru/organic dyes in sensitized solar cells (SSCs) due to their unique properties such as high absorption coefficient, convenient bandgap tunability, large intrinsic dipole moment, multiple exciton generation and good stability.1 Therefore metal chalcogenides including CdS(e),2 PbS(e),3 and Sb2S34 have been intensively utilized as new sensitizers in the SSCs and the power conversion efficiency has been stiffly increased until now.
Among the metal chalcogenide sensitizers, Sb2S3 seems to be a very attractive sensitizer because it has a suitable bandgap energy of ∼1.7 eV and a high extinction coefficient of 1.8 × 105 cm−1 in the visible region.5 Recently Sb2S3 extremely thin absorber (ETA) cells4a using CuSCN as a hole conductor and Sb2S3-SSCs4b using Spiro-MeOTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene) have been reported. Very recently we have also reported Sb2S3-sensitized heterojunction solar cells with over 5% of power conversion efficiency under 1 sun illumination.4c,d In addition, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of Sb2S3 based solar cells is over 80% across the whole visible region (400 nm–700 nm in wavelength) and thus these examples clearly confirm the excellency of Sb2S3 as a new inorganic sensitizer to attain high power conversion efficiency.
Despite the prominent characteristics of Sb2S3 as a sensitizer, mostly it has been synthesized by chemical bath deposition (CBD) based in a very cold water medium. It has been well recognized that Sb2S3 is commonly synthesized from SbCl3 as an Sb source and Na2S2O3 as a S source. In a water medium, SbCl3 is quickly converted into insoluble SbOCl if the temperature of the water medium is not sufficiently cold.5 Therefore it seems difficult to completely remove the antimony oxide form which may potentially deteriorate device performance. In this regard, it is obviously important to design and synthesize a new precursor for the formation of Sb2S3 by CBD in a non-aqueous medium. Here we synthesized a new single source precursor for the CBD of Sb2S3 in a non-aqueous medium.
Unlike different metal salts, the SbCl3 can be dissolved in an organic solvent and the C2H5NS (thioacetamide: TA) as an organosulfur compound can also be dissolved in an organic medium. Accordingly we choose SbCl3 and TA to synthesize a single source precursor in an organic medium. For the preparation of a single source, we mixed 0.659 g TA (8.77 mmol) in 100 ml dichloromethane and 1.0 g SbCl3 (4.38 mmol) in 20 ml dichloromethane, and magnetically stirred it at room temperature for 30 min. When the reaction proceeded, the product was precipitated. We washed the precipitated powder with CH2Cl2 and then filtered it. Finally we collected the pure powder by recrystallization with an acetonitrile–CH2Cl2 solution (yield = 90%). From the elemental analysis we have found that the produced precipitate is C4H10Cl3N2S2Sb (anal. calc. for C4H10Cl3N2S2Sb: C, 12.77; H, 2.68; N, 7.45%. Found: C, 12.93; H, 2.86; N, 7.27%).
To characterize the crystal structure of Sb(III)(TA)2Cl3, we grew a suitable single crystal of it in an acetonitrile–CH2Cl2 solution for X-ray diffraction (see the Experimental section in ESI†). The ORTEP plot of Sb(III)(TA)2Cl3 with atomic numbering is shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  ORTEP diagram of Sb(III)(TA)2Cl3. Three chlorides and two sulfurs from two thioacetamides are bound to Sb(III) to form square pyramidal geometry. 
The molecular structure of Sb(III)(TA)2Cl3 is a distorted square pyramid which has two chlorides (Cl1 and Cl3) and two sulfurs from thioacetamide on the square plane. The distance, 2.941 Å, between Sb(III) and Cl3 is relatively longer than that between Sb(III) and Cl1 (2.4086(4) Å) or Cl2 (2.4618(4) Å). The elongated distance between Sb(III) and Cl3 implies that there is another interaction between Cl3 and other atom or atoms. The extended structure in Fig. 2 shows that Cl3 has weak interaction (3.124 Å) with neighboring Sb(III) to form severely distorted square bipyramidal geometry.

The crystal data and structure refinement; atomic coordinates and equivalent isotropic displacement parameters; and bond lengths and angles are summarized in Tables S1–3 in ESI.†
To check if the synthesized Sb(III)(TA)2Cl3 precursor can produce Sb2S3 by CBD in a non-aqueous medium, we conducted CBD experiments in various non-aqueous solvent media. We found that the Sb(III)(TA)2Cl3 precursor forms a stable clear yellow solution in acetone or acetonitrile medium at room temperature. On the other hand, the single source precursor formed an orange precipitate (amorphous Sb2S3) by immediate reaction in alcohols (polar protic solvents) and it was not soluble in CH2Cl2 (non-polar solvents). Typically the alcoholic solvents led to an orange precipitate within several minutes. Accordingly, such polar protic or non-polar solvents are not acceptable to a CBD medium by themselves. The apparent solubility and precipitation time in various solvents are summarized in Table 1.

Based on the above experiments, we think that the chemical reaction of the Sb(III)(TA)2Cl3 precursor in solution seems to be caused by the alcohols having a nucleophilic, hydroxyl group. Therefore, we firstly dissolve the Sb(III)(TA)2Cl3 precursor in acetone to get a stable clear solution and then add an excess amount of alcohol in order to induce the chemical reaction for the formation of Sb2S3 under various conditions (see the summary of representative experimental conditions and their device performance in Table 2) because it is expected that the substitution reaction will be promoted by the nucleophilic interaction between the hydroxyl oxygen from alcohol and the sp2 carbon (C1 in Fig. 1) of thioacetamide. Initially we conducted the CBD in a non-aqueous medium at 5 °C for which the temperature condition is similar to the conventional CBD in an aqueous medium. Primary alcohols such as methanol or ethanol gave rise to a fast reaction followed by the color change of the solution from pale yellow to dark yellow. To adjust the overall CBD time, we performed the CBD at room temperature and 60 °C in 2-methoxy ethanol and 2-propanol medium, respectively, owing to the more sterically hindered reaction. The least hindered solvent, H2O, provided dark yellow powders as soon as water was dropped into the antimony complex in acetone.

The increased reaction rates by less hindered solvents might be attributed to that the reactions between Sb(III)(TA)2Cl3 and alcohols follow the SN2 reaction mechanism. Based on the reaction mechanism, the Sb2S3 might be formed from a single source precursor by the proposed reaction scheme in Fig. 3.6
 Fig. 3  Reaction scheme between Sb(III)(TA)2Cl3 and an alcoholic solvent. 
To fabricate Sb2S3-sensitized heterojunction solar cells, we deposited Sb2S3 on a 1 μm thick mesoscopic TiO2 film/blocking TiO2/FTO (fluorine doped SnO2, TEC8, Pilkington)4c–f,7 by CBD in a non-aqueous medium as summarized in Table 2 (see the Experimental section in ESI† for the detailed device fabrication procedure). The deposited amorphous Sb2S3 was then heat treated at 300 °C for 30 min in an Ar atmosphere to convert amorphous phase to crystalline stibnite. It should be noted that here the CBD condition is not optimized to attain high device performance. Rather we focus on the development of a new single source precursor for the CBD in a non-aqueous medium. The obtained device performance with various alcoholic media and CBD conditions was acceptable to be applied to a new single source precursor for the CBD in a non-aqueous medium. The device performance in Table 2 implies that the newly designed single source precursor can produce Sb2S3 at a much wider reaction temperature (from below 0 °C to 60 °C) while the reaction temperature of conventional CBD in an aqueous medium is limited to low temperature (from over 0 °C to 10 °C) owing to the formation of insoluble SbOCl2 in the reaction bath. Accordingly the Sb(III)(TA)2Cl3 precursor will be very robust and useful to tune the experimental conditions to attain high device performance. The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curve and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of solar cells are shown in Fig. 4. Currently we could obtain higher device performance than the cell fabricated from the aqueous phase CBD process, previously reported.4 The main reason seems to be associated with the different coating behavior between aqueous and non-aqueous phase CBD. We believe that if we adjust and find a proper processing condition for the non-aqueous phase CBD process, we can further improve the device efficiency.

To check the purity of Sb2S3 obtained from the non-aqueous phase CBD process using the Sb(III)(TA)2Cl3 precursor, we compared X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Sb2S3 obtained from the conventional aqueous phase CBD and the non-aqueous phase CBD process as shown in Fig. 5. To prepare the Sb2S3 by the aqueous phase CBD process for XPS analysis,4,5 we mixed 2.5 ml of SbCl3/acetone (0.65 g/2.5 ml) solution, 25 ml of 1 M Na2S2O3 solution, and 75 ml of deionized water. After the reaction at <10 °C for 2 h we collected the orange powder by filtration. The filtered powder was washed several times with deionized water and dried. The dried powder was then heat-treated at 300 °C for 30 min in a N2 atmosphere. We also collected the Sb2S3 powder from the solution used in the Fig. 4 experiment and heat-treated in the same manner. Fig. 5(a) shows that the deconvolution of the Sb 3d core level exhibits two chemical states of Sb2S3 (1 and 1′) and Sb2O3 (2 and 2′), and an overlapping oxygen peak (3), O 1s.8 These spectra clearly confirm that the Sb2S3 prepared by the aqueous phase CBD process contains some amount of Sb2O3 while the Sb2S3 produced by the non-aqueous phase CBD process does not reveal any oxide peaks as shown in Fig. 5(b).

In summary, we designed and synthesized a new single source precursor for the CBD of Sb2S3 in a non-aqueous medium. The single source precursor was simply synthesized by reacting SbCl3 and TA and subsequent purification by recrystallization. From the X-ray diffraction analysis of a single crystal, we confirmed that the synthesized precursor is Sb(III)(TA)2Cl3. We have found that the synthesized single source precursor can be stably dissolved in acetone or acetonitrile medium and is converted to Sb2S3 by the nucleophilic interaction between the hydroxyl oxygen from alcohols and the sp2 carbon of thioacetamide. Therefore we could control the reaction rate of Sb2S3 formation by changing the reaction temperature and the kind of alcoholic medium. In addition, the Sb(III)(TA)2Cl3 precursor could produce Sb2S3 in a non-aqueous medium at a much wider reaction temperature range from below 0 °C to 60 °C than conventional CBD in an aqueous medium for which the reaction temperature is limited to low temperatures between 0 °C and 10 °C owing to the formation of insoluble SbOCl2 in an aqueous medium. From the XPS analysis, it is confirmed that this work provides effective means to deposit high-purity Sb2S3. However, further work will be needed to improve the device performance.
