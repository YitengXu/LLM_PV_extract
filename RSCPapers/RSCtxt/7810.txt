    , Accepted 13th June 2015First published on 3rd July 2015AbstractIn this work, we report improved performance by controlling morphology using different fullerene derivatives in poly{2-octyldodecyloxy-benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene-alt-5,6-bis(dodecyloxy)-4,7-di(thieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole} (PBDT-TBT-alkoBT) based organic solar cells. PC60BM and PC70BM fullerenes were used to investigate the characteristic changes in morphology and device performance. Fullerenes affect device efficiency by changing the active layer morphology. PC70BM with broader absorption than PC60BM resulted in reduced device performance which was elucidated by the intermixed granular morphology separating each larger grain in the PC70BM/polymer composite layer which created a higher density of traps. However after adding additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), a fibrous morphology was observed due to the reduced solubility of the polymer and increased solubility of PC70BM in chloroform. The fibrous morphology improved charge transport leading to an increase in overall device performance. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), photo-induced charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV), and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) were used to investigate the nanoscale morphology of the active layer with different fullerene derivatives. For the PC60BM based active layer, AFM images revealed a dense fibrous morphology and more distinct fibrous morphology was observed by adding DIO. The PC70BM based active layer only exhibited an intermixed granular morphology instead of a fibrous morphology observed in the PC60BM based active layer. However, addition of DIO into the PC70BM based active layer led to fibrous morphology. When additive DIO was not used, a wider distribution of surface potential was observed for PC70BM than the PC60BM based active layer by KPFM measurements, indicating that polymer and fullerene domains are separated. When DIO was used, a narrower distribution of surface potential for both PC70BM and PC60BM based active layers was observed. Photo-CELIV experiments showed larger extracted charge carrier density and mobility in the PC70BM/DIO film.
Introduction
Inexpensive fabrication, low temperature processing, mechanical flexibility and light weight have made organic photovoltaic devices a promising candidate for future solar cells.1–5 The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure has widely been used with the intent of achieving high efficiency solar cells up to 10% consisting of intermixed donor and acceptor networks of conjugated polymer and fullerenes.6 For highly efficient polymer solar cells, the electrochemical properties and energy levels of fullerene acceptors are very important. The fullerene derivative PC60BM or PC70BM as an acceptor is extensively used in bulk heterojunction solar cells.7–9 The energy levels of fullerene derivative acceptors can be changed by using bisadducts and multiadducts. PCBM consists of two or more functional groups. The LUMO level of those fullerenes was found to be higher than that of normal PCBM, thus increasing open circuit Voc. However, the symmetric properties of fullerene derivative PCBM were disturbed in bisadduct and multiadduct fullerenes, hindering electron transport.10 Thus, these excellent fullerene derivatives exhibiting high performance in the polymer fullerene composite have always been limited.11 The energy level of fullerene derivatives and their electrochemical properties in a ternary blend system containing a fullerene PC61BM/PC71BM mixture with a polymer show enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCEs) due to the enhanced absorption of PC71BM and balanced charge transport of PC61BM.12 In addition, the chemical structure of fullerenes,13 their miscibility in polymers,14 intercalation,15 and position of C60 in some regioisomer (bisadduct) fullerenes help to tune the device performance.16,17
To optimize BHJ morphology, several parameters such as choice of solvent,18 conditions of film casting,19 post-film deposition technique, effect of additives,20 temperature, concentration, treatment for electron and hole transport layers,21 and deposition of electrodes have been taken under consideration. These parameters are directly affected due to the presence of fullerene derivatives. Fullerene derivatives have thus become ubiquitous acceptors because of their high electron affinity and ability to transport charge effectively and tune morphology. However, the impact of fullerene derivatives on the morphology and optoelectronic properties of polymers has not been explained.
In this paper we investigated the changes in morphology of novel polymer PBDT-TBT-alkoBT due to the addition of fullerene derivatives PC60BM and PC70BM, respectively. In addition, the optoelectronic properties of novel polymer PBDT-TBT-alkoBT intermixed with fullerenes PC60BM and PC70BM were studied. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), photo-induced charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV), and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) were used to correlate the nanoscale morphology of polymers with different fullerene derivatives.
Experimental section
The alternating copolymer PBDT-TBT-alkoBT (C-107) was prepared by typical Suzuki polymerization in the lab. Phenyl-C61/C70 butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) and PC70BM were ordered from Nano-C. Zinc acetate dehydrate, ethanolamine, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), MoO3, Ag and 2-methoxyethanol were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 1 mg of zinc acetate dehydrate [Zn(CH3COOH·2H2O)] dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2OH, 10 ml) and 0.28 mg of mono-ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH) as a stabilizer was used to prepare zinc oxide sol–gel. The solution was vigorously stirred for 12 h.
For device fabrication, indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass slides were cleaned by ultra-sonication for 20 min in detergent water, de-ionized water, acetone and 2-propanol sequentially followed by oxygen plasma cleaning for 25 min before spin-coating a sol–gel ZnO layer. ZnO sol–gel was coated at 4500 rpm for 1 min and then kept on a hot plate at 60 °C for 5 min to remove residual solvents and finally annealed at 200 °C for 30 min. ZnO coated substrates were then transferred to a nitrogen filled glovebox having lower than 1 ppm of O2 and H2O. The DIO additive was added with concentrations of 2% and 4% by volume for 10 min before spin coating. The blend solution PBDT-TBT-alkoBT:PCBM (1:2) with the additive was spin-coated at 600 rpm for 60 s and then transferred to a thermal evaporator where 10 nm of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) and 80 nm of silver (Ag) were thermally evaporated in vacuum below 2 × 10−6 Torr.
Current density–voltage characteristic measurements were performed on an Agilent 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer. A xenon arc lamp was used as the light source (AM 1.5). A silicon photo-detector was used as the standard which was calibrated at the National Renewable Energy laboratory (NREL). The device was fabricated using an ITO substrate (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) having a cell area of 0.16 cm2. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out using a xenon lamp attached to a Newport monochromator.
An Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer was used to determine UV-vis absorption. A blank scan was first performed on ZnO coated ITO substrates followed by a sample scan of the active layer. Atomic force microscopy was used to determine the topography image.22 AFM was conducted in tapping mode using an Agilent 5500 SPM (scanning probe microscope). Tips of the AFM were made with silicon, coated with Cr/Pt having a resonance frequency of ∼300 kHz. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was performed in a single pass AM-FM mode providing information on topography and surface potential. Topography was performed in AM mode and KPFM was performed in FM mode. Gwyddion software was used to analyze the AFM and KPFM images.
Energy filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) was performed with a Zeiss Libra 120 kV. PEDOT:PSS coated substrates were immersed in deionized water. The active layer which floated on the surface of water was picked with 600 mesh honey comb shaped Ni grids (Ted Pella). Information on domain composition was provided by EFTEM which generated elemental maps of polymer and fullerenes.23,24 EFTEM images were taken in 19 eV ± 5 eV for the donor map (donor brighter) and 30 eV ± 5 eV for the acceptor map (acceptor brighter). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) experiments were performed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM).25,26 The SAED pattern was recorded with 576 mm camera length. Al (111) was used as the calibration standard (0.234 nm).
The photo-induced current extraction by linear increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) technique was used to determine recombination lifetime, extracted charge carrier density and charge carrier mobility (µ).27,28 The experiment was designed in our lab using a nanosecond laser (OBB OL-401), a function generator and a digital oscilloscope integrated together, operated using a customized Lab-view program. Keeping solar cells under open circuit conditions, a laser pulse was incident on the device. After certain varying delay time, a voltage ramp was applied for extracting photo-generated charge carriers.
Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry measurements were conducted to determine the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of the polymer.29,30 The apparatus consists of a carbon rod as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and platinum wire as the counter electrode. Voltage was swept at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at room temperature. Ferrocenes were used as an external reference. 0.1 M of tetra butyl ammonium phosphorus hexafluoride (TBAPF6) in anhydrous acetonitrile (CH3CN) solution was used as the electrolyte. First, the oxidation onset of ferrocenes was obtained from calculation. A thin layer of C-107 was coated on the carbon electrode for the HOMO and LUMO measurements.
Results and discussion
The chemical structure of co-polymer PBDT-TBT-alkoBT is shown in Fig. 1a. The UV-vis absorbance spectrum of pure polymer is shown in Fig. 1b. The absorption peak at 650 nm is pronounced for pure polymer. Pure polymer has two observed peaks due to the donor (BDT) and acceptor (TBT) units at 450 nm and 650 nm, respectively. The optical bandgap measured by the absorption onset (λ = 710 nm) is ∼1.74 eV. Cyclic voltammetry was used to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymer were found to be about −5.65 eV and −3.85 eV respectively, leading to an electrochemical band gap of ∼1.80 eV.

Fig. 2 shows the absorbance spectra of polymer:PC60BM and PC70BM with and without DIO. The peak observed at 350 nm is due to fullerene absorption and those at 450 nm and 600 nm correspond to the absorption of polymer. Absorption at 450 nm caused by polymer donor units is more pronounced for films casted with PC70BM and PC70BM/DIO due to the broad absorption of fullerene PC70BM in the visible spectrum. The intensity of the vibronic peak is found to increase with the addition of DIO which characterizes molecular ordering in the blend film. The literature reveals that the higher structural order is induced by the poor solubility of fullerenes in DIO.31,32

Fig. 3 shows the current density vs. voltage (J–V) curves and EQE of solar cells from PC60BM and PC70BM with and without the addition of DIO. The short circuit current density (Jsc) increased from 6.50 mA cm−2 to 7.5 mA cm−2 for PC60BM and from 2.52 mA cm−2 to 11.6 mA cm−2 for PC70BM with the addition of DIO which led to enhancement in power conversion efficiency. The results are summarized in Table 1. External quantum efficiency (EQE) without additive is lower than that with the additive (DIO) added to the solution within the entire wavelength region. In spite of increase in the absorption intensity with PC70BM fullerenes, EQE is found to decrease, indicating a significant difference in molecular interactions.

In order to investigate the surface morphology, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out with and without solvent additive for polymers PC60BM and PC70BM, respectively. AFM images of blends with PC60BM and PC70BM are shown in Fig. 4. Topography images show that films processed with DIO as the additive have more fibrous surface morphology as DIO leads to the aggregation of the polymer phase into crystalline fibers. The RMS roughness of blend films with PC60BM, PC60BM/DIO, PC70BM, and PC70BM/DIO is 3.05 nm, 3.75 nm, 8.49 nm and 3.38 nm, respectively. The PC70BM blend film exhibits a much rougher surface showing aggregation of polymer and fullerenes. The phase images show different color contrasts which indicates an intermixed phase. Big granular morphology was observed in the PC70BM based blend. These spherical domains are separated from each other with a larger interface gap.

Kelvin probe microscopy (KPFM) was used to measure the local surface potential. As shown in Fig. 5a, the PC60BM:polymer composite shows a narrower potential distribution with a higher surface potential value than the PC70BM based mixture. When DIO was added, the work function of the PC60BM:polymer composite decreased. The PC70BM:polymer composite exhibits a wider distribution of potential with one shoulder and one peak. Polymer distribution is illustrated with a sharp peak while that of fullerenes by the shoulder. However, when DIO is added to the PC70BM:polymer composite, the surface potential increases with a narrower distribution potential. For the films fabricated with the additive, the line profile in Fig. 5b shows finer variation of surface potential which indicates finer phase separation whereas for the films fabricated without additive shows least variation of surface potential.33

Fig. 6a–d show EFTEM images of polymer PBDT-TBT-alkoBT with fullerenes PC60BM, PC70BM, PC60BM/DIO and PC70BM/DIO, respectively. EFTEM images show an intermixed domain surrounded by a polymer boundary except for films fabricated with fullerene PC70BM/DIO. Donor and acceptor maps (ESI†) show contrast inversion indicating an intermixed domain. However, the film fabricated with PC70BM/DIO does not show contrast inversion and both the donor and acceptor map images are mirror image of each other, due to the large thickness variation in the sample film. Polymer forms a skin layer, thus leading to more prominent vertical charge transport. This is due to fullerene PC70BM being more soluble in the solvent (chloroform) with DIO. Thus, DIO remains in solution and is more soluble in fullerenes leading to aggregation of polymer resulting in nanoscale phase separation.

Fig. 7 shows radial profile distribution of polymer:PC60BM and PC70BM with and without DIO obtained from the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern. The peak at the 150 pixel is attributed to the d spacing of the polymer. A prominent peak is observed in all cases except PC70BM/DIO that exhibits the higher solubility of fullerene PC70BM in the solvent (chloroform) with DIO.

The charge carrier mobility (average of electron and hole mobilities) of the blend was calculated using the photo-charge carrier extraction by linear increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) technique. The equation used is  where ΔJ is the extraction current maximum, A is the voltage ramp speed, J0 is the capacitive displacement current, d is the thickness of the active layer and tmax is the time to reach this maximum extraction current. The photo-CELIV curve at 7 µs delay time for films with PC60BM and PC70BM as fullerenes is shown in Fig. 8a. The extracted charge carrier vs. delay time plot is shown in Fig. 8b. Before the application of the voltage ramp, the extracted charge carrier density decreases with the increase in delay time for all the devices. The extracted charge carrier density of PC70BM/DIO films increases by four orders of magnitude as compared to PC70BM films. The enhanced extracted charge carrier density and mobility in PC70BM/DIO solar cells are the highest, attributing to the effect of fullerenes and DIO on finer phase separation (Table 2).

Conclusions
Inverted structure bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated using two different fullerenes and their effects on active layer morphology were studied. The PC70BM based devices exhibited lower device efficiency than PC60BM due to their lower Jsc, FF and higher series resistance. This was attributed to the larger bimolecular recombination and granular active layer morphology with grains separated by a larger interface. Addition of DIO leads to an increase in overall efficiency by finer phase separation between fullerenes and polymer. The PC70BM:PBDT-TBT-alkoBT composite shows larger bimolecular recombination than fullerene PC60BM. The bimolecular recombination decreases with the addition of DIO. The solubility of PC70BM is higher in the solvent (chloroform) with DIO leading to finer phase separation.
