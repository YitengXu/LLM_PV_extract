The power conversion efficiency of the dye-sensitized solar cell coated with a pyrene photoluminescent layer improves from 9.12 ± 0.06% to 10.30 ± 0.11% (an improvement of 12.94%).
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been intensively studied because they can capture sunlight and convert it into electricity in a clean and sustainable way.1,2 They offer an alternative method for the fabrication of low-cost and flexible solar cells. DSSCs are devices containing a dye-immobilized wide bandgap semiconductor photoelectrode, a redox active electrolyte, and a counter electrode. In a DSSC, sunlight is absorbed by dye molecules, in which photoexcited electrons are injected into the conduction band of a nanocrystallite and transported across the nanoparticle network. There have been many strategies addressing the enhancement of the cell performance of DSSCs. Efforts have been made to improve the power conversion efficiency (η) of DSSCs by efficient light harvesting in the visible region,3–6 suppression of charge recombination between the injected electrons and the dye radical cations,7–9 promotion of electron transfer from the adsorbed dyes to the TiO2 photoelectrode,10–12 and efficient hole transport to the counter electrode.13–16 There are many factors limiting the performance of a DSSC, among which energy loss resulting from the spectral mismatch between the energy distribution of photons in the incident solar spectrum and excitation bands of the dye is very important. Therefore, the search for photoluminescent materials for overcoming the poor spectral response to short wavelength light of DSSCs is of great interest. The cell performance of DSSCs could be enhanced by shifting the spectrum to wavelengths that more closely match the excitation bands of the dye with a higher efficiency.
Luminescent materials have been applied in many fields of technology.17–21 In solar cells fabricated with photoluminescent materials, incident photons are modified to appropriate energy by upconversion, downconversion, or photoluminescence to provide a better overall performance.22 Spectral modification is done to convert or shift the incident light towards the wavelength corresponding to spectral responses before the sunlight reaches the solar cells (downconversion and photoluminescence) or after it has passed through the photovoltaic devices (upconversion). Recently, many lanthanide doped spectral modifiers in a variety of hosts have been prepared and used to enhance the performance of silicon solar cells.23 In this study, we demonstrate the coating of a pyrene photoluminescent layer on the front side of a DSSC, which can modify the solar spectrum to reduce the spectral losses and enhance η as shown in Fig. 1. The performance of a DSSC coated with a pyrene photoluminescent layer is compared with that of an uncoated DSSC. The effect of the amount of the pyrene photoluminescent layer coated on the front side of a DSSC on the photovoltaic performance is evaluated and the photoelectrochemical characteristics are described and discussed.

TiO2-based DSSCs exhibit a maximum incident photon to current efficiency at around 500–600 nm. A major limitation of DSSCs using cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719) dye is that only a small portion of the ultraviolet sunlight is harvested.24–27 Moreover, fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass cuts off ultraviolet light at a wavelength below 320 nm. Therefore, an ideal ultraviolet-absorbing photoluminescent conversion layer for DSSCs should effectively capture the ultraviolet part of the solar spectrum and then convert these ultraviolet photons into narrowband emission matching the absorption of the dye. The absorption spectrum of the N719 dye adsorbed on TiO2/FTO glass and the emission spectrum of pyrene coated on FTO glass are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. Pure N719 dye adsorbed on TiO2/FTO glass shows two absorption bands centered at 390 and 540 nm, respectively, due to the metal to ligand charge transfer.28 The emission spectrum of pyrene coated on FTO glass exciting at 335 nm is shown in Fig. 2b. A main strong blue emission with a maximum at about 472 nm is observed. The blue emission generated by pyrene is close to the absorption band of N719 dye. Therefore, it is expected that a pyrene photoluminescent layer coated on the front side of a DSSC can improve the light harvesting. The pyrene photoluminescent layer will exhibit a characteristic blue emission upon excitation at a wavelength less than 335 nm and then adsorbed by a sensitizing ruthenium N719 dye. The quantum yield of pyrene is ca. 0.31, which was measured in ethanol with reference to coumarin-1 (0.99 in ethyl acetate).

The surface morphology of a pyrene photoluminescent layer coated on the front side of a DSSC was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in order to investigate the coating process on the DSSC. The AFM images of the uncoated DSSC and the DSSC coated with a pyrene photoluminescent layer (pyrene/DSSC) are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. A typical AFM image of pyrene/DSSC is shown in Fig. 3b. This result shows that the pyrene photoluminescent layer was coated onto the front side of a DSSC. From the AFM images we also can conclude that the surface of the pyrene/DSSC is rougher in Fig. 3b than that of the uncoated DSSC in Fig. 3a. The root-mean-square roughness values are 3.3 and 158.1 nm for the uncoated DSSC and pyrene/DSSC, respectively. This is attributed to the fact that the pyrene photoluminescent layer is coated on the front side of the DSSC.

Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics were determined for the uncoated DSSC and pyrene/DSSC in order to investigate the effect of the pyrene photoluminescent layer on the performance of DSSCs. The J–V curves of the uncoated DSSC and pyrene/DSSC are shown in Fig. 4. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) are almost unaffected by coating a pyrene photoluminescent layer on the front side of the DSSC. It is clear that the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the pyrene/DSSC is higher than that of the uncoated DSSC, resulting in improved η. The photovoltaic parameters obtained for the pyrene/DSSC are Jsc = 17.90 ± 0.22 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.78 ± 0.01 V, FF = 0.72 ± 0.01, and η = 10.05 ± 0.20%, and those obtained for the uncoated DSSC are Jsc = 16.24 ± 0.26 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.78 ± 0.02 V, FF = 0.72 ± 0.01, and η = 9.12 ± 0.06%. The higher Jsc obtained for the pyrene/DSSC is attributed to the blue emission at around 472 nm generated by the pyrene photoluminescent layer being efficiently adsorbed by the N719 dye, which indeed leads to enhancement of the performance of the DSSC. The increase of Jsc is consistent with the improvement in light harvesting because the pyrene photoluminescent layer absorbs the short wavelength light and re-emits it at a longer wavelength. As a result of the increased Jsc, a ∼10.20% increase of η is obtained for the pyrene/DSSC when compared to the uncoated DSSC. The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is defined as the ratio of the number of electrons in the external circuit produced by an incident photon at a given wavelength. As expected, the pyrene/DSSC shows a higher IPCE and integrated current in the wavelength range of 300–400 nm than that of the uncoated DSSC (Fig. S1, ESI†), which is in good agreement with the observed higher Jsc of the pyrene/DSSC. These results indicate that the coating of a pyrene photoluminescent layer on the front side of a DSSC is able to enhance the efficiency of light harvesting. Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) is a transparent and most popular adhesive film for encapsulation of photovoltaic solar panels. It can also be observed from Fig. 4 that there is no obvious difference in J–V characteristics between the pyrene/DSSC and the coating of EVA on top of the pyrene/DSSC (EVA/pyrene/DSSC).

The similar values of η for the pyrene/DSSC and EVA/pyrene/DSSC suggest that the effect of coating of EVA on top of the pyrene/DSSC is insignificant. Therefore, coating of EVA on top of the pyrene/DSSC is used to prevent the loss of the pyrene photoluminescent layer during the preparation of DSSCs for further study. The thickness of EVA/pyrene film is ca. 6 μm, which was determined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Fig. S2, ESI†).
To investigate the effect of the amount of the pyrene photoluminescent layer coated on the front side of a DSSC on the photovoltaic performance, the J–V characteristics were determined by using six different pyrene photoluminescent layer contents (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 wt%) for the preparation of EVA/pyrene/DSSCs. The J–V characteristics of EVA/pyrene/DSSCs with six different amounts of pyrene photoluminescent layers are shown in Fig. 5. Jsc, Voc, FF, and η for all EVA/pyrene/DSSCs are listed in Table 1. The Jsc increased from 18.35 ± 0.41 to 18.59 ± 0.67 mA cm−2 (from 0.05 to 0.1 wt% pyrene), and then decreased from 18.59 ± 0.67 to 17.99 ± 0.68 mA cm−2 (from 0.1 to 1.6 wt% pyrene). An increased Jsc with increasing amounts of pyrene photoluminescent layers in the range of 0.05 to 0.1 wt% is attributed to more light harvesting in DSSCs. By increasing the amount of the pyrene beyond 0.1 wt%, the enhancement in light harvesting that results from the coating of a pyrene photoluminescent layer can be offset by a lower transmittance also ascribed to a higher amount of the pyrene photoluminescent layer (Fig. S3, ESI†). This leads to a lower Jsc at a higher amount of pyrene photoluminescent layers. The values of η are 10.03 ± 0.20%, 10.30 ± 0.11%, 10.07 ± 0.13%, 10.06 ± 0.14%, 10.03 ± 0.09%, and 9.84 ± 0.07% for EVA/pyrene/DSSCs with 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 wt% pyrene photoluminescent layer contents, respectively. The η increases upon coating of a pyrene photoluminescent layer on the front side of a DSSC and reaches a maximum at 0.1 wt%. However, a subsequent increase in the amount of pyrene (0.2–1.6 wt%) does not help to increase the η. The pyrene content of 0.1 wt% achieves the highest conversion efficiency. There is a ∼12.94% increase in η for the DSSC coated with a pyrene photoluminescent layer when compared with an uncoated DSSC. Clearly this effect is linked to the improvement in the Jsc.

In summary, we have demonstrated that an enhanced photovoltaic performance can be obtained by coating a pyrene photoluminescent layer on the front side of a DSSC. The enhanced photovoltaic performance is correlated with the process of modifying photons with higher energy to ones with lower energy, which more closely matches the excitation bands of the N719 dye. Upon coating a layer of 0.1 wt% pyrene spectral modifier on the front side of a DSSC, an η of 10.30 ± 0.11% is achieved using an I−/I3− electrolyte to regenerate the N719 dye. It should be stressed that an ideal photoluminescent material for application on DSSCs should possess high quantum yield and high transmittance. This prepared photoluminescent layer might open new perspectives to develop high-performance DSSCs.
