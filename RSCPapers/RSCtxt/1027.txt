    , Accepted 10th April 2018First published on 11th April 2018AbstractExcellent corrosion resistance is crucial for photovoltaic devices to acquire high and stable performance under high corrosive complicated environments. Creative inspiration comes from sandwich construction, whereby Fe3O4 nanoparticles were anchored onto hollow core–shell carbon mesoporous microspheres and wrapped by N-graphene nanosheets (HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO) to obtain integrated high corrosive resistance and stability. The as-prepared multiple composite material possesses outstanding performance as a result of structure optimization, performance improvement, and interface synergy. Therefore, it can effectively suppress corrosion from the electrolyte in recycled tests many times, indicating the ultrahigh corrosion resistance life of this double carbon-based nanocomposite. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity and conversion efficiency of the composite are well maintained due to the triple synergistic interactions, which could serve as a guideline in establishing high-performance multifunctional HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO with great prospects in energy devices, such as lithium batteries, supercapacitors and electrode materials, etc.
1. Introduction
Electrocatalysis is a crucial method to evaluate whether performance is excellent in energy conversion fields. Nanostructured materials are frequently used to improve the electrocatalytic performance. Such research has been mainly concentrated on the architecture-structure connections of nanoscale inorganic materials in the electrocatalytic field.1–5 Research has clearly demonstrated that modifying the chemical composition and crystal structure of nanoscale inorganic materials contributed greatly to not only achieving distinct electrocatalytic properties but also to tuning the charge transfer, catalytic properties and stabilization, as anticipated.6–10 Recently, design and construction to form hollow core–shell hybrid nanostructures of electrocatalysts is widely studied because of the superior electrocatalytic activities and excellent electrochemical stabilities of these nanostructures in comparison with uniform nanostructures.11–14 On the one hand, the hollow core–shell mesoporous structures increase the surface-to-bulk ratio and the contact area between the active material and the electrolyte.11 Therefore, this can accelerate efficient ion transportation, which is favorable for the adsorption and desorption of reactants. On the other hand, the design and architecture of evenly dispersed nanoparticles can accelerate charge separation and charge transfer, and can optimize and enhance the activity of the electrocatalysts.15,16
In recent years, Fe3O4 has been widely used in ORR,17 supercapacitors18 and lithium ion batteries,19 due to its low resistivity and excellent catalytic performance. Meanwhile, Fe3O4 is abundant and environmentally friendly in nature. In addition, the coexistence of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions with their special occupation sites within the crystal structure of Fe3O4 leads to ultralow resistivity, and so naturally it has been brought to our attention. However, Fe3O4 is susceptible to oxidation into Fe2O3 during practical application. So chemical stability is always a problem that seriously impedes its widespread use. Ghasemi et al. reported the application of graphene-iron oxide nanocomposite (Fe3O4/RGO) as the CE in DSSCs.20 As they reported, the composite was synthesized with an electrophoretic deposition method and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the cell was 5.91%, which was less than that of Pt (8.62%). In addition, cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves reveal that the composite is not as stable when in contact with the electrolyte. Therefore, it is still necessary to look for a strategy that can overcome these shortcomings.
Herein, we report a facile and low-cost in situ strategy to first synthesize a hollow core–shell carbon mesoporous microspheres/Fe3O4/nitrogen-doped RGO (HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO) heterostructure, which can completely protect Fe3O4 from corrosion by the electrolyte. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles were completely evenly distributed in the mesoporous structure of the carbon sphere to improve the movement of electrons, which can also further achieve an improvement in the electrocatalytic activity. It is noteworthy that the HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO CEs exhibit a pre-eminent performance which is much better than that of Pt in every aspect of power conversion efficiency, its catalytic properties and electrochemical stability. The fatigue behavior when in the electrolyte is a key parameter via frequentative CV cycles and plays a great role in flexible energy devices as well. In DSSCs the conversion efficiency of HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO as the CE not only achieves 9.89%, but it is even higher than the efficiency of Pt (7.68%) and is also superior to some other electrode materials.21–23 The electrochemical stability of the CE has been significantly improved, manifested by soaking it in the electrolyte for 2 hours to obtain cyclic voltammetry data for 60 cycles at a slow scanning speed of 25 mV s−1. This novel strategy of multiple synergistic interactions provides a pathway for constructing high-performance multifunctional carbon-based material nanocomposites in the future. In addition, the hybrids which served as highly efficient Pt-free CEs of DSSCs have many advantages compared to other competing products such as easy preparation, low cost and simple post-treatment. This perfect structure and remarkable performance could open up a new route for the potential applications of multiple composite materials in DSSCs and in other clean energy systems. It should be noted that our research only focused on the design, synthesis and photo-electrochemical properties tuning of the CEs, and the other components of our solar cell including the photoanode (TiO2), dye and electrolyte were purchased domestically and conveniently at a low cost.
2. Results and discussion
In order to fully demonstrate the actual effects of multiple synergies, a three-dimensional architecture was promptly designed and established to potentially provide enhanced flexibility for performance optimization. We reported a type of CE that consists of hollow core–shell carbon mesoporous microspheres (HCCMS) containing Fe3O4 nanoparticles and fully wrapped by N-doped graphene nanosheets (N-RGO) constructed in three steps, and it was briefly labeled HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO. The formation process of the HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO nanocomposites is illustrated in Scheme 1, in which the key step is the configuration growth by the HCCMS-SiO2 precursor etched in a solution of sodium hydroxide to form HCCMS, and catecholate provides a carbon source. Then the HCCMS were poured into Fe(NO)3 solution under magnetic stirring for 24 h and the product was collected by centrifugation followed by annealing at 700 °C for 1 h. Finally, the mesopores and well-dispersed Fe3O4 particles were formed. When the solution was just a mixture of Fe(NO)3 and graphene, HCCMS/Fe3O4@RGO was successfully synthesized in the same reaction conditions. When tripolycyanamide was added into the mixture of Fe(NO)3 and graphene, the graphene was decorated to form N-RGO and the final product was the HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO nanocomposite. A detailed preparation process can be found in the ESI.†

2.1. Composition analysis
The crystal structures of RGO, HCCMS and the triple composites (HCCMS/Fe3O4@ RGO and HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO) were confirmed using XRD, which are shown in Fig. 1(a). The very impressive peak around 24° is for the RGO and HCCMS. The typical diffraction peaks of the triple composites at 18.4°, 30.2°, 35.5°, 37.1°, 43.2°, 53.1°, 57.1°, 62.8°, and 87.1° can be indexed well as the (111), (220), (311), (222), (440), (422), (511), (440) and (642) crystal planes of Fe3O4 (JCPDS: 75-0033), which demonstrates that an Fe3O4 single phase has been accomplished. However, the results show that no obvious diffraction peaks of carbides and nitrites can be found in the triple composites. It can be clearly seen that the strongest diffraction peak (311) declines with the accumulation of carbon. The weakening of the strongest diffraction peak revealed that the sample may have been covered by double carbon layers.
 Fig. 1  (a) The crystal structures of RGO, HCCMS and the triple composites were confirmed using XRD. (b) The existence of double-carbon and N can be verified with Raman spectroscopy. The inset gives the characteristic peaks of Fe3O4. (c) The spectrum reveals the existence of oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and Fe elements. (d) The broad peak of C 1s could be divided into four peaks and demonstrate a relatively dominant signal. (e) Four types of N functionalities, including pyridinic N (398.6 eV), pyrrolic N (399.5 eV), graphitic N (401.1 eV), and oxidized N (403.5 eV) are present, and (f) the Fe 2p3/2 peak can be separated into two noticeable peaks. 
The existence of C and N can be verified with Raman spectroscopy as displayed in Fig. 1(b). As can be seen, the HCCMS shows the same ratio of the peak intensities of D to G bands to that of the RGO. A typical “D” band at 1350 cm−1 is ascribed to the defect disordered structures and the “G” band at 1580 cm−1 is assigned to the sp2 hybridized graphitic carbon structures. The intensity ratio of the D and G band can be used to assess the defect disordered structures of carbon materials.23,24 A higher ID/IG ratio suggests that more defective sites, which imply structural distortion induced by doping with nitrogen, would enhance the electrocatalytic activity of the HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO counter electrode.25,26 The D and G peaks of HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO are stronger than the corresponding peaks of HCCMS/Fe3O4 and HCCMS/Fe3O4@RGO, indicating that N-graphene oxide is successfully reduced and introduced. The inset of Fig. 1(b) gives the characteristic peaks of Fe3O4.
Moreover, in order to prove the existence of the N element, the chemical composition of the as-prepared HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO was further studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 1(c), the spectrum reveals the existence of oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and Fe elements. The appearance of the nitrogen species can be attributed to the formation of N-doped carbon structures during the carbonization of tripolycyanamide. In Fig. 1(d), the broad peak of C 1s could be divided into four peaks and demonstrates a relatively dominant CC peak at 284.6 eV along with C–N/C–H (285.4 eV), C–O (287.4 eV), and CO (290.3 eV) configurations. Furthermore, high resolution N 1s spectra, shown in Fig. 1(e), suggest four types of N functionalities, notably pyridinic N (398.6 eV), pyrrolic N (399.5 eV), graphitic N (401.1 eV), and oxidized N (403.5 eV). The above characteristic peak changes are found in the HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO nanocomposite, compared to the peaks of HCCMS/Fe3O4@ RGO. The Fe 2p3/2 peak can be separated into two noticeable peaks, which can testify the existence of Fe2+ (711.13 eV) and Fe3+ (712.63 eV), as shown in Fig. 1(f).
This fact confirms the mixed-valent state of Fe ions and evidences that Fe3O4 single phase has been achieved. Iron ion (Fe3+) chelate complexes result in high extensibility of the mussel byssus cuticle,27 which clearly implies synergistic interactions of covalent and ionic bonding, and excellent long cycle life. Excellent long cycle life can be ascribed to synergistic interfacial interactions of ionic and covalent bonding to achieve super high fatigue-resistant graphene-based nanocomposites with remarkable electrical conductivity. Excellent corrosion resistance will be further supported by the results of the circulation test in the electrolyte.
2.2. Morphology and structure analysis
Fe3O4 nanoparticles are prone to agglomerate due to their ultra-small size and unstable energy,28 which is shown in Fig. S2(a).† This seriously impedes the fine performance of the nanoparticles in turn. Therefore we need a larger specific surface area of the nanoparticles to contact with the electrolyte to obtain enough active catalytic sites. Hence, creative inspiration has led to Fe3O4 nanoparticles being forced to pack into the mesopores and be evenly distributed on the surface of the carbon microspheres. SEM and TEM images revealed an evolution of HCCMS to HCCMS/Fe3O4 at different magnifications, which are shown in Fig. 2(a–d). The untreated carbon microspheres are shown in Fig. S1(a, b).† The carbon microspheres after the annealing process are presented in Fig. S1(c, d).† It is noticeable that large numbers of mesopores appear on the surface of uniform carbon microspheres, with an average size of about 10 nm, shown in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. S2(b, c).† From Fig. 2(b) and Fig. S3(a, b)† it can be clearly seen that each of the homogeneous carbon spheres contains a flake-shaped core as a base to form the special core–shell structure, which is also shown in Fig. S2(d).† SEM images [Fig. 2(c) and Fig. S2(e and f)†] and TEM images [Fig. 2(d) and Fig. S3(c and d)†] clearly show that the Fe3O4 nanoparticles are successfully encapsulated within the mesopores to form the HCCMS/Fe3O4 composite and part of the nanoparticles exist in the form of quantum dots. Meanwhile, HRTEM images of Fe3O4 nanoparticles in the mesoporous structure are also presented in Fig. S3(e and f).† Therefore, the excellent properties of each Fe3O4 particle are fully utilized by structure reconstruction and this gives full access to the excellent properties of the nanoparticles for electron transport.
 Fig. 2  SEM and TEM images revealed an evolution of HCCMS to HCCMS/Fe3O4 at different magnifications. 
The performance synergism is, however, masked by the mutual optimization of structural reorganization. Therefore, to further prove the existence of performance synergism, the introduction of graphene is required. The successful introduction of RGO and N-RGO can be shown by SEM and TEM, and the images are displayed in Fig. 3(a–d). In Fig. 3(a), the SEM images reveal that the HCCMS/Fe3O4 spheres are entirely encapsulated by graphene sheets. This may improve their interface contact, suppress the dissolution and increase their specific surface area. It also can improve the monolayer electron transfer route and protect the corrosion of Fe3O4 from the electrolyte, and also strengthen the adsorption of electrons to obtain efficient and stable electrocatalytic activity.29,30 The internal structure is analyzed by TEM, shown in Fig. 3(b). We find that due to the template effect of the graphene,31 the HCCMS/Fe3O4 spheres coated by graphene form a uniform hierarchical structure and develop a graphene coat. At the same time, another phenomenon which caught our attention was that the Fe3O4 nanoparticles form hollow particles after being confined by both HCCMS and RGO. Accompanying the removal of the N element from the starting material of Fe(NO3)3 during the heat treatment at high temperature, the internal pressure of the Fe3O4 particles encapsulated in the HCCMS/Fe3O4@RGO composite forces the core to expand, leading to hollow Fe3O4 particles.32 Meanwhile, it was found that the structural and morphology features of the HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO spheres were not changed, as presented in the SEM and TEM images shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d). The EDS measurement of HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO is shown in Fig. S4.† Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and BJH were tested and the results are shown in Fig. S8,† displaying the large surface area and small pore size when the N element is introduced to modify the graphene under high temperature annealing. HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO has an extremely large surface area, abundant edge sites and fully exposed basal planes, which would help to transfer electrons rapidly from an external circuit to triiodide and reduce charge-transfer resistance, thus contributing to enhanced photovoltaic performance.23

2.3. Electrochemical testing
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in a symmetric cell with two identical electrodes (CE/electrolyte/CE). The schematic structure of a symmetric cell used for the measurement of EIS and Tafel polarization is displayed in Fig. 4(a). This is a useful pathway to expound the electrocatalysis of all the different pairs of electrodes, which can clearly explain the internal interface charge transport mechanism. The Nyquist plots and the corresponding equivalent circuits are displayed in Fig. 4(b) for the HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO composite, HCCMS/Fe3O4@RGO composite, HCCMS, RGO as CEs, and for Pt as well for comparison. Meanwhile electrochemical testing of RGO and N-RGO are displayed in Fig. S10–S13.† It is noteworthy that two semicircles are shown in Fig. 4(b). The left semicircle represents the high frequency, which was attributed to charge transfer resistance (Rct). It mirrors the catalytic activity of CEs for I3− reduction. The other semicircle represents the low frequency, which was assigned to Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN).33 Series resistance (Rs) can be attributed to the high-frequency intercept on the real axis.34 The parameters for Rs and Rct are listed in Table 1. The minimum Rct value for HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO is about 0.08 Ω, which is much smaller than that of Pt (0.49 Ω), HCCMS/Fe3O4 (0.24 Ω) and HCCMS/Fe3O4@RGO (0.12 Ω). The lowest Rct is associated with quicker charge-transfer kinetics, which can enhance the electrocatalytic activity area of CE and reveal that N species could introduce additional active sites. It is also beneficial to contact well between the electrode and electrolyte, thus resulting in efficient charge transfer.35,36 Effective reduction of I3− to I− could expedite the dye regeneration at the photoanode, leading to an improvement in photocurrent density (Jsc). Meanwhile, a lower Rct would lead to lower series resistance, which would contribute to improving the fill factor of solar cells.37,38

Tafel polarization measurements were also executed in symmetric cells to examine the catalytic activity and further survey the property of I−/I3− redox couple transference on the surface of each CE.39 The Tafel curves of various CEs are presented in Fig. 4(c), which shows the logarithmic current density as a function of potential. We found that the HCCM/Fe3O4@N-RGO CE has a relatively larger slope for the anodic or cathodic branch, indicating a higher exchange current density (J0). The limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) can be regarded as the intersection of the cathodic branch and the Y-axis, which can evaluate diffusion properties of the redox couples. The two parameters are closely associated to the catalytic activity of the samples. Table 1 gives detailed values of J0 and Jlim, according to the formula in eqn (1) and (2), (1) (2)
In eqn (1), R represents the gas constant, T represents the temperature, F represents the Faraday constant, and n represents the number of electrons exchanged in the reaction between the CE interface and the electrolyte. In eqn (2), e is the elementary charge, C is the concentration of the triiodide, D is the diffusion coefficient of the triiodide, NA is the Avogadro constant, and l is the electrode spacing. The calculated results are in good agreement with the EIS values. The rich edge sites of HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO coupled with the activated basal planes should result in the highest photovoltaic performance.
To further confirm the electrocatalytic activity of all of the samples, CV was performed in a three-electrode system and the schematic structure is revealed in Fig. 5(a). It can clearly be seen that there is a typical curve with two pairs of redox peaks shown in Fig. 5(b). It is noteworthy that the electrodes possess two typical pairs of oxidation/reduction peaks. The Ox1/Red1 pair in the CV plots belong to the oxidation and reduction of I−/I3−. The peak current and peak separation between the anodic and cathodic peaks (Epp) are very important parameters for estimating the catalytic activity of the CE.38 The Epp value of HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO is obviously smaller than that of Pt, indicating the fact that the over-potential loss of the HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO CE is lower than that of the Pt CE in DSSCs and can be clearly seen in Fig. 5(c). The high peak current densities and low Epp values suggest that the HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO electrode presents high catalytic activity in the reduction of I3−, which is a very important condition for an excellent CE in DSSCs.

We have further analysed the cyclic voltammograms recorded at different scanning rates for HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO. This was to determine the relationship between the scanning rates and the peak current densities of oxidation/reduction peaks. Along with the gradual increase of the scanning speed, a linear relationship was discovered between the peak current densities and the square root of the scanning rates, as shown in Fig. 5(d) and (e). The phenomenon demonstrates that I−/I3− and HCCM/Fe3O4@N-RGO are not involved in the chemical reactions, they just limit the diffusion of electrons on the HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO CE.37
To confirm the excellent photovoltaic property of HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO in DSSCs, a schematic structure of a DSSC using HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO as the CE is presented in Fig. 6(a) and J–V curves of DSSCs based on different CEs under irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 were obtained, which are clearly displayed in Fig. 6(b) and (c). The detailed photovoltaic performance parameters are listed in Table 2. The cell based on the HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO composites achieves a short-circuit (Jsc) of 17.4 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.795 V, a fill factor (FF) of 66.88% and conversion efficiency (η) of 9.89%, which is superior to the value of Pt (7.63%). The high efficiency can be attributed to the successful introduction of N-graphene. It is generally known that graphene has excellent properties such as high Fermi velocity and extremely high electrical mobility. Therefore, the synergistic effect of the combination of HCCMS/Fe3O4 and N-RGO can promote the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte interface, thus providing more surface reaction sites and speeding up diffusion kinetics, which would strengthen the electrochemical performance to improve the photovoltaic performance. Meanwhile, this further demonstrates that the N-doped graphene contributes to the enhanced catalytic activity toward the reduction of I3−.40

The electrochemical stability of CEs in CV tests is a very significant parameter, which can affect the potential application of DSSCs. To assess the electrochemical stability of Fe3O4, HCCMS/Fe3O4, HCCMS/Fe3O4@RGO, HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO and Pt, 60-cycle CV with 25 mV s−1 scanning speed was further performed, showing that the electrochemical stability of the HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO CE is far superior to all CEs, as shown in Fig. 7(a–d). Meanwhile, the 60-cycle test result of Pt is presented in Fig. S14.† These results demonstrated the excellent stability of the HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO CE, which can be attributed to the fact that HCCMS/Fe3O4 was encapsulated within N-RGO and thus was protected from leaching and corrosion by the electrolyte.
 Fig. 7  25-cycle CV curves with a 25 mV s−1 scan speed of pure Fe3O4 and HCCMS/Fe3O4, and 60-cycle CV curves with a 25 mV s−1 scan speed of HCCMS/Fe3O4@RGO and HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO. 
After 60-cycle CV tests, the change in the morphology and structure of HCCMS/Fe3O4@RGO and HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO was tested by TEM. It can be clearly seen that the graphene has become wrinkled and the N-doped graphene is almost unchanged, as displayed in Fig. 8(a) and (b). J–V curves were obtained again after the 60-cycle CV for all samples, which are shown in Fig. S15.† All parameters are shown in Fig. S15.† The power conversion efficiency of HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO still achieved 8.81%, which was still about 89% of the initial data.

As mentioned above, Fe3O4 nanoparticles are excellent catalytic materials for DSSCs, and the performance of Fe3O4, HCCMS/Fe3O4 HCCMS/Fe3O4@RGO and HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO in an analysis diagram is shown in Fig. 9. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles are restricted due to severe agglomeration. Meanwhile, Fe3O4 is completely exposed to the electrolyte with corrosive action, which slowly disrupts the structure and the catalytic activity gradually disappears. When the Fe3O4 nanoparticles were forced into mesoporous carbon microspheres, the agglomeration issue was addressed and the optimization of structural recombination brought about an improvement in the PCE, and the stability during the CV tests also improved to some degree because the Fe3O4 particles were surrounded by carbon, which is shown in Fig. 7b and Table 2. However, the stabilization of HCCMS/Fe3O4 has not reached the ideal state, since Fe3O4 is still exposed to the electrolyte. Furthermore, reduced graphene is introduced, which can completely encapsulate the HCCMS/Fe3O4 spheres due to the high flexibility of RGO. Consequently, it is found that not only the stability during the CV tests greatly improved, but also the PCE was optimized, which are also both presented in Fig. 7c and Table 2. Lastly, the interfacial interactions effect plays an important role on the performance of the materials.41,42 Here, N elements are introduced to modify graphene and enhance the interfacial interaction. It is pleasing to note that the performance of the composite is once again improved. N-doping introduces defects into the graphene, so the interaction between graphene and small molecules could be strengthened.43,44 Meanwhile, the carbon network with heteroatoms (N) can introduce electrocatalytic active sites with a minimized change to the conjugation length due to N-doping.45,46 N-doping has already been proven to improve electrical conductivity to accelerate charge-transfer and electrolyte–electrode interactions, respectively, and can even impart electrocatalytic activities.47 N-doping of carbon nanotubes and graphene46,47 has demonstrated that N-doped carbon materials can possess higher electrocatalytic activities, better long-term operation stability and more tolerance to poisoning in fuel cells.48,49 Due to the structural distortion induced with N-doping, it exhibits a stronger electrocatalytic activity as the CE.50 The chelate architecture, constructed by the coordination of Fe3+ and N (tripolycyanamide) has been verified.27,42,51 The chelate architecture usually plays a significant role in enhancing fatigue behavior in the electrolyte.52 Iron ion (Fe3+) chelate complexes result in the high extensibility of mussel byssus cuticle and result in synergistic interfacial interactions of ionic and covalent bonding to achieve ultrahigh fatigue-resistant graphene based nanocomposites with hyper stability in a corrosive electrolyte.

This novel strategy for synergistic interfacial interactions by covalent and ionic bonding provides a pathway for constructing high performance which can be constantly reinvented to optimize multifunctional nanocomposites in the future.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, the HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO composite has been designed and constructed. It was found that a CE made of the HCCMS/Fe3O4@N-RGO composite displayed a power conversion efficiency of 9.89% and great stability, which is much better than Pt in every aspect. If the newest photoanode (TiO2), dye and electrolyte designed by other groups are available, and assembled with our CEs, it is envisaged that the cell would present much better performance. These results may pave a new way in developing friendly, stable, economic, and highly efficient counter electrodes for DSSCs.
