    , Accepted 12th April 2019First published on 16th April 2019AbstractThe quality of the perovskite layer has an important influence on the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. An appropriate additive can effectively improve the quality of perovskites. In this work, pyrrole is introduced into a cesium-containing triple cation perovskite precursor solution and this strategy is demonstrated to control the crystallinity of perovskite films. The pyrrole ring is hydrophobic, and its nitrogen atom (N) can combine with the lead–iodine (Pb–I) framework by coordinating with Pb ions or pyrrole forms hydrogen bonds with organic cations. XRD patterns and AFM images prove that pyrrole significantly affects the crystallinity and roughness of perovskite films. The pyrrole-modified device exhibits a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.07%, while the pristine device has an efficiency of 18.58% under the same conditions. This approach suggests an important direction for improving the film quality to reduce trap density and charge recombination.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show promise in the new field of photovoltaics due to their excellent optoelectronic properties.1–5 The original formula of the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials is MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3+), where CH3NH3+ can be partially replaced by NH2CHNH2+ (FA) and Cs+, and iodide ions (I−) can be partly substituted with bromine ions (Br−).6–9 The new ternary cation-mixed perovskite light absorbing material has attracted considerable attention due to its high absorption coefficient, long carrier lifetime and tunable energy band,10–12 and can also be applied in space.13 With continuous efforts to optimize the structure and photovoltaic properties of the devices, the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has increased to 23.7% in the past few years.14,15
In general, ternary cation-mixed perovskite films tend to be rough and inhomogeneous, and are also sensitive to air.16,17 Therefore, it is necessary to explore additives which can induce uniform growth and improve the crystallinity of perovskite films. Up to now, great efforts have been made to improve the properties of perovskite films.18–20 Liu et al. proposed a model of the passivation mechanism to understand how the molecules simultaneously passivate the Pb–I antisite defects and vacancies created by under-coordinated Pb atoms.21 This approach has positive impacts on the efficiency and stability of the devices by means of passivation.
Herein, we demonstrated that the addition of a small amount of pyrrole to the perovskite precursor can passivate the perovskite films and improve the efficiencies of devices. Due to the passivation of pyrrole (pyrrole can coordinate with Pb ions or form hydrogen bonds with an organic cation), the pyrrole-based device has high quality perovskite films and is more stable than the pristine device in air (10 ± 5 RH%, 25 °C). The concentration of pyrrole from 0.15 M/L to 0.6 M/L was optimized. Finally, the optimal PCE of the pyrrole-modified PSCs reached 20.07% compared with the pristine device (PCE of 18.58%), and the pyrrole-modified device retains 89.9% of the initial efficiency in a desiccator (10 ± 5 RH%, 25 °C) for one month, while that of the pristine device is reduced to 73.2% under the same storage conditions. All devices are based on a regular n–i–p planar heterojunction structure.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Pre-patterned fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated (FTO) substrates with a sheet resistance of 14 Ω sq−1 were purchased from Pilkington. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification, including formamidinium iodide (FAI, Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp), methylammonium bromide (MABr, Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp), lead iodide (PbI2, 99.99%, TCI), lead bromide (PbBr2, 99%, TCI), pyrrole (>99%, TCI), and spiro-OMeTAD (Luminescence Technology Corp). Besides, bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), 4-tert-butylpyridine, chlorobenzene (CB) and acetonitrile were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
2.2. Fabrication of PSCs
FTO substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath sequentially with detergent, deionized water and alcohol for 20 min. Afterwards, the substrates were further cleaned by UV–ozone treatment for 15 min and using a plasma cleaner for 5 min. Then, a compact TiO2 blocking layer (c-TiO2) was spin-coated onto the FTO substrate using a two-step program (700 rpm for 5 s with a ramp-up of 1000 rpm s−1, sequentially with 4000 rpm for 25 s with a ramp-up of 2000 rpm s−1), followed by sintering in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 30 min. c-TiO2 was synthesized by a facile solvothermal reaction similar to the one mentioned in previous literature.22 The following spin-coating steps were performed in an argon-filled glovebox. For the fabrication of the cesium-containing triple cation perovskite, a perovskite precursor solution was prepared with PbI2 (529 mg), FAI (187.4 mg), PbBr2 (74.3 mg), MABr (15.73 mg) and CsI (17.55 mg) in a mixture of anhydrous DMF:DMSO with a volume ratio of 4:1. Four equal proportions of the precursor solution were stirred for 2 h, and the prepared pyrrole (0.15 M, 0.3 M and 0.6 M) was added to three of the precursor solutions and further stirred for 1 h. Then, 40 μL perovskite precursor solution was deposited onto the substrates of c-TiO2/FTO with a two-step spin-coating procedure: 1000 rpm for 10 s with an acceleration of 1000 rpm s−1, followed by 5500 rpm for 25 s with an acceleration of 2000 rpm s−1. During the second step, 140 μL of chlorobenzene was cast onto the center of the spinning substrate at 15 s of the procedure. Afterwards, the substrates were immediately placed on a hotplate at 100 °C for 60 min and then cooled down to room temperature naturally. After that, a hole-transport layer was deposited on the perovskite films with a spin-coating method (4000 rpm for 30 s with a ramp-up of 2000 rpm s−1), which was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg spiro-MeOTAD in 1 mL chlorobenzene, as well as 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 μL Li-TFSI solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile). Finally, an Au electrode (80 nm) was deposited by thermal evaporation (under a vacuum condition of <5 × 10−4 Pa) using a shadow mask to complete the fabrication. Therefore, the active area of the devices was defined as 0.37 cm2.
2.3. Characterization

Film characterization. 
Surface morphologies of the perovskite films were obtained through field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite films were obtained on a Bruker X-ray diffractometer with a Cu-Kα radiation source. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the perovskite films were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 950UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer in the wavelength range of 450–800 nm. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectrum was recorded on an Omni-λ monochromator excited with a 760 nm laser. The roughness of the perovskite films was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Multimode-8J).


Device characterization. 
Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2420 source meter (Keithley Instruments). Standard one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) was provided using a Xe lamp-based solar simulator (Irvine, CA) and the light intensity was calibrated using NREL-calibrated silicon solar cells equipped with a KG-2 filter. Dark J–V curves were measured on a Keithley 2420 source meter in the dark. The stabilized power output was measured on an electrochemical work station (CHI66 0E, Chenhua Co. Ltd, Shanghai) under simulated AM 1.5 G sunlight and 100 mW cm−2 irradiation. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured with a QE-R quantum efficiency measurement system (Enli Technology Co. LTD). All characterization and measurements were performed in the ambient environment without encapsulation.

3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the schematic diagram of the preparation of the perovskite films and Fig. 1b presents the schematic structure of PSCs with the form Au/spiro-OMeTAD/CsFAMA perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL, c-TiO2)/FTO. As shown in Fig. 1c, the cross-sectional SEM image of the device fabricated with 0.3 M pyrrole (0.3 M Pr) shows a dense and uniform perovskite crystal and the thickness of the perovskite film is about 580 nm. All the top-sectional SEM images of the perovskite films doped with and without pyrrole are presented in Fig. 1d. The white flakes are excess PbI2 which has been proven to be beneficial for device performance by passivation.23,24 The grains of the pyrrole-doped perovskite films (400–500 nm) become more compact compared with that of the pristine film (300–400 nm), and good compactness can significantly improve the crystallinity and reduce the nonradiative losses.25 However, when the doped concentration of pyrrole reaches 0.6 M/L, the perovskite film is accompanied by pinholes and unevenness which are likely caused by excessive pyrrole residues. It is obvious that the doping concentration of pyrrole has a great influence on the quality of the films.

To further illustrate the effect of pyrrole on the surface roughness of the perovskite films, the AFM images are shown in Fig. 2. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the perovskite film with 0.3 M Pr is 18.6 nm, while the RMS roughness of the pristine film is 29.4 nm. The smooth surface of the perovskite film is more favorable for improving the interfacial contact with the electron transport layer (ETL) and the hole transport layer (HTL).26 In order to explore how pyrrole affects the roughness of the perovskite films, we carried out Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements on the unannealed pristine film (NA pristine), unannealed pyrrole-doped (NA 0.3 M Pr) film and annealed pyrrole-doped (A 0.3 M Pr) film (Fig. S1a, ESI†). Fig. S1b† shows the magnification of FTIR spectra for the corresponding films in the wavelength range of 1200 cm−1 to 1670 cm−1, and the peaks at 1649 cm−1 and 1618 cm−1 represent the deformation of the N–H bond; we estimate that the reason for the peak shift is the hydrogen bonding of FAI and pyrrole. However, the peak of the A 0.3 M Pr film at 1616 cm−1 shows a slight shift compared with that of the NA pristine film but there is no obvious shift similar to the NA 0.3 M Pr film, which is likely caused by the alignment of crystals during the annealing process. To sum up, it can be concluded that pyrrole plays an intermediate role in the formation of perovskite films. The XRD patterns of the perovskite films with and without pyrrole are shown in Fig. S2;† the perovskite films are deposited on c-TiO2/FTO substrates. The peak at 12.8° can be indexed to the (001) lattice plane of unreacted PbI2 which is consistent with the SEM images. The two theta peaks from 10° to 12.5° of the pristine film represents the unreacted formamidinium iodide (FAI) species. The characteristic peaks at 14.2° and 28.4° correspond to the (110) and (220) lattice planes, and originate from the perovskite film.27 It is obvious that the peak intensity of the modified film is significantly higher than that of the pristine film. Furthermore, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (110) lattice planes was increased from 0.133° to 0.167°, suggesting increased crystallinity and decreased trap density.28 Besides, no additional new peaks in the XRD spectrum are observed with the introduction of pyrrole (0.3 M), which further illustrates that pyrrole as an intermediate does not change the crystal structure.
 Fig. 2  AFM images of the pristine film (without pyrrole) and the perovskite film doped with 0.3 M pyrrole. 
The effects of pyrrole on the photoelectric properties and film quality were evaluated from the UV-vis absorption spectra, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and TRPL spectra (Fig. 3). All samples were prepared on plasma cleaned FTO substrates. In the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 3a), the absorption edge of the films is almost unchanged with the addition of pyrrole (Fig. 3b). Besides, compared with the pristine film, a stronger absorption for the films (0.15 M Pr and 0.3 M Pr) is inferred at a wavelength above 530 nm, which is likely attributed to the good compactness and reduced defects. However, the absorption of the pyrrole-doped film (0.6 M) is always lower than that of the pristine film which is likely caused by the defects in the film. Fig. 3c shows the steady-state PL spectra of the perovskite films. The maxima of the emission peak (at 760 nm) correspond to the perovskite films under the same excitation.8 The luminescence emission peak represents radiative recombination and nonradiative losses. The increasing peak intensity further illustrates the reduction of defects and enhancement of crystallinity.29 This is in the right direction to define the results which are well consistent with the SEM images and UV-vis absorption spectra. To gain a further insight into the effect of pyrrole on the charge-carrier recombination dynamics of perovskite films, the TRPL spectra of the perovskite films with and without pyrrole are shown in Fig. 3d. The spectra could be fitted to a bi-exponential decay formula: I(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp (−t/τ2) + B, where the A represents the decay amplitude, τ1 represents the fast decay lifetime (related to nonradiative losses) and τ2 represents the slow decay lifetime (related to radiative recombination).25 The detailed data are listed in Table S1 in the ESI.† It is obvious that the pyrrole-doped films (0.15 M Pr and 0.3 M Pr) display a much longer PL decay than the pristine film, suggesting the reduced trap density and improved crystal quality of the perovskite films.

To further investigate photovoltaic performances of the PSCs, a series of measurements are shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4a shows the J–V curves (reverse scan) of the pristine device and the target devices modified with pyrrole (0.15 M Pr, 0.3 M Pr and 0.6 M Pr), and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S2,† which include the short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE). The device with pyrrole doping achieved an impressive PCE of 20.07%, with a JSC of 22.99 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.142 V and a FF of 0.763, showing a palpable difference compared with the pristine device with a PCE of 18.58%, a JSC of 22.26 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.101 V and a FF of 0.758. It is apparent that the VOC and JSC of the pyrrole-doped device are significantly higher than those of the pristine device. The enhancement in photovoltaic parameters may be ascribed to the reduced nonradiative recombination and improved quality of the perovskite films. It is well known that the J–V hysteresis is ubiquitous in the planar heterojunction structure with c-TiO2/FTO substrates.30 Fig. S3a† shows the J–V curves of the devices with and without pyrrole doping under forward bias scan and reverse bias scan, and the active area of the devices was defined as 0.1225 cm2 (detailed information can be found in Table S3†). It can be concluded that the device with pyrrole doping reduces hysteresis by optimizing the quality and charge recombination kinetics of the perovskite films. Besides, Fig. S3b† displays the J–V curves (reverse scan) of the devices with and without pyrrole doping (active area of the devices was defined as 0.37 cm2) and the detailed photovoltaic parameters can be found in Table S4.† The modified device has a PCE of 18.67%, in complete contrast to the case of pristine PSCs (with a PCE of 16.87%). As mentioned above, the photovoltaic properties of 15 devices with and without pyrrole doping are shown in Fig. S5 and Table S5.† Obviously, the PCEs are enhanced significantly with the concentration of pyrrole increasing from 0 M to 0.3 M but become smaller at 0.6 M. The VOC and JSC have similar trends to the PCE, while the difference in FF is almost negligible.

Fig. 4b shows the EQE spectra of the corresponding devices to crosscheck the reliability of the current density. A maximum EQE plateau of over 91% is observed for the pyrrole-doped device in a wavelength ranging from 300 to 800 nm. The integrated current densities of the corresponding EQE spectrum were calculated to be 21.52 and 20.73 mA cm−2, which is in accordance with the current density achieved from the J–V curves. Fig. 4c shows the steady-state power output characteristics (at the maximum power point) and the PCE of the device with pyrrole doping. Compared with the pristine PSC (Fig. S6†), it could be seen that the device with pyrrole doping exhibited a stable current density of 20.4 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 19.1% at a bias of 0.94 V, and the modified device is more stable than the pristine one within 400 s. However, the long-term stability of PSCs is critical for future commercial applications.31 To get more insight into the stability, we tested the devices with and without pyrrole doping for 32 d under ambient conditions (35 ± 5 RH%, 25 °C, Fig. S7†). The pyrrole-modified device retains 89.9% of its initial efficiency, while that of the pristine device is reduced to 73.2% under the same conditions. This proves that the stability of the pyrrole-modified film is improved. Fig. 4d shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra of the devices with and without pyrrole at a 0.5 V bias under one sun illumination. The equivalent circuit is consistent with the EIS spectra, including the series resistance (Rs), recombination resistance (Rrec), and charge-transfer resistance (Rct). Rs corresponds to the resistance of the electrodes; the first semicircle is related to Rct which is mainly associated with the interface resistance of the ETL and the perovskite layer, and the incomplete semicircle is related to Rrec.32 The PSCs with pyrrole doping showed smaller Rs (13.5 Ω) and Rct (56.7Ω) which are responsible for the smoother surface and reduced roughness of the perovskite films.
To further probe the charge recombination kinetics in the PSCs, we study the dependence of VOC and JSC on the light intensity (I) as shown in Fig. S8.† Fig. S8a† shows the variation of JSC with light intensity in the form of the power law equation (JSC ∝ Iα; α is an exponential factor in response to charge recombination).30–32 The pristine device and pyrrole-doped device have α values of 0.925 and 0.887; α values of the modified device are much closer to unity, suggesting an effective carrier transportation from the perovskite layer to the c-TiO2 layer. Fig. S8b† shows the dependence of open-circuit voltage (VOC) on logarithmic light intensity of the devices with and without pyrrole. The relationship between VOC and light intensity (I) can be fitted to the equation:  (ε is the ideality factor, K is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and e is the elementary charge).33–35 According to the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination kinetics, a larger slope (ε > 1) indicates the presence of larger trap state density for the PSCs. The ε values of the pristine device and pyrrole-doped device are 1.848 KT/e and 1.475 KT/e, indicating effective suppression of charge recombination by employing pyrrole as a passivating agent.
In order to further explore the trap density (ntrap) in the PSCs with and without pyrrole, we performed space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements on the devices with the structure Au/PCBM/perovskite/c-TiO2/FTO under dark conditions. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the corresponding J–V curves of the electron-only devices consist of three regions: the ohmic region (at low bias), the trap-filled limited (TFL) region (at middle bias) and the trap-free space charge limited current (SCLC) region (at high bias). With the bias increasing, the traps are filled constantly until the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) is attained.36,37 It can be seen that the VTFL values decrease from 0.471 V for the pristine device to 0.162 V for the pyrrole-doped device. The values of ntrap determined by VTFL are calculated from the equation: ntrap = 2εε0VTFL/eL2, where e is the elementary charge, d is the thickness of the perovskite film, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity and ε is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite.8,36 Comparing the pristine device with a ntrap of 1.15 × 1016 cm−3, the modified device achieved a lower ntrap of 3.76 × 1015 cm−3. The decrease of ntrap further demonstrates the passivation of the perovskite films by pyrrole.

To further demonstrate the origin of the rise in VOC and JSC, the dark J–V characteristics of the PSCs with and without pyrrole doping are exhibited in Fig. 5c. Based on the diode law, the VOC of PSCs can be fitted to the expression  (n is the ideality factor, K is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and J0 is the dark saturation current density). The value of J0 is in response to the charge recombination of the devices, and the expression indicates that smaller J0 will lead to higher VOC.38,39 For the modified device, the values of J0 and n are estimated to be 7.85 × 10−9 mA cm−2 and 1.79, whereas the J0 and n of the device without modification are 1.65 × 10−5 mA cm−2 and 2.67. These results provide strong evidence that the reduced charge recombination of the device with pyrrole doping is responsible for the improved VOC.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that a tiny amount of pyrrole doping can passivate perovskite films and help to obtain devices with an improved PCE, which can be attributed to the fact that pyrrole can coordinate with Pb ions or form hydrogen bonds with organic cations. Systematic measurements have proven reduced trap density, nonradiative recombination and improved crystal quality of the perovskite films. Finally, the optimal concentration of the pyrrole added to PSCs resulted in an impressive PCE of 20.07% compared with the pristine device (PCE of 18.58%), which stabilizes the PSCs for more than one month when stored in a desiccator (10 ± 5 RH%, 25 °C). This research offers a new strategy to optimize perovskite films aiming to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.
