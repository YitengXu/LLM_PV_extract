    , Accepted 24th November 2020First published on 24th November 2020AbstractLead halide two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials (NCs) have attracted continuous attention owing to their unique optoelectronic properties. However, the toxicity of lead largely prevents their commercialization. Therefore, environmentally friendly lead-free 2D perovskite NCs are sorely needed in the aspects of application. Recently, 2D lead-free halide perovskite Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs have attracted intense attention because of their environmentally friendly and potentially useful photovoltaic behavior. In this work, we explored the structure–property relationship of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs by using high pressure techniques. The band gap of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs was narrowed by about 0.69 eV, originating from Bi–Br bond contraction and Br–Bi–Br bond angle changes in the [BiBr6]3− octahedra. Angle dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction patterns and Raman spectra show that the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs experienced a phase transition from the trigonal phase to monoclinic phase, and then amorphization with increasing pressure. The results also indicate that the changes are reversible after pressure relief. First-principles calculations further demonstrate that the band gap is largely influenced by the orbital interactions, which is related to the distortion of the Bi–Br octahedral network under pressure. Our research not only strengthens the basic understanding of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs, but also enables pressure processing as an efficient and environmentally friendly strategy to improve the application of design-by-design materials.
Introduction
Halide perovskites have been at the forefront of state-of-the-art photovoltaic materials owing to their outstanding performance. Lead-based perovskites are the typical representatives of metal halide perovskites due to their excellent physical properties. Recently, the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has largely increased from the initial reported value of 3.8% to 25.5%.1,2 However, the low stability and the high toxicity of lead are still two main concerns for the development of their commercialization, which has obstructed the efficient application of lead-based halide perovskites. Bismuth-based halide perovskites are alternatives to lead because of their lower toxicity and better chemical stability. Therefore, non-toxic and air-stable lead-free Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs have recently attracted huge attention. In spite of some studies on Cs3Bi2Br9, there are few reports about the understanding of its structural details and properties.3–6 With respect to applications, it is urgent to elucidate the structure–property relationship for expanding the recognition and continuing research.
Pressure, as a clean tuning method, is widely used because it can successfully modulate the electronic structure, bonding patterns and chemical behavior without changing the chemical composition.7–12 Success in discovery of novel phenomena and even acquisition of new materials was obtained upon compression. Recently, high-pressure studies on halide perovskites have set off a new wave of enthusiasm.13–15 Various novel phenomena have been observed under pressure.16–21 Pressure-induced emission (PIE) was realized through high pressure technology.22,23 Fang et al. observed the PIE phenomena of 2D halide perovskites (BA)4AgBiBr8 (BACH3(CH2)3NH3+), attributing to the emission from self-trapped excitons (STE).24 Zhang et al. confirmed the pressure-induced metallization of Cs3Bi2I9 at 28.0 GPa through high-pressure electrical experiments.25 Furthermore, Li et al. designed the STE emission of 0D (bmpy)9[ZnBr4]2[Pb3Br11] (bmpy: 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium) with pressure and successfully achieved controllable piezochromic behaviors from yellow green to cyan, even obtaining an unprecedented white-light emission.26
Herein, we explored the structure–property relationship of 2D Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs under pressure. In situ high-pressure absorption spectra, Raman spectra and angle dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction demonstrate that the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs experienced a structural phase transition from the trigonal phase to monoclinic structure, and then amorphization under pressure. The band gap was reduced to 1.97 eV, originating from Bi–Br bond contraction and Br–Bi–Br bond angle changes within the [BiBr6]3− octahedra. First-principles calculations further demonstrate that the band gap is mainly influenced by the orbital interactions, which is related to the distortion of the Bi–Br octahedral network under pressure. Our research not only strengthens the basic understanding of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs, but also enables pressure as an efficient tool to adjust the structure and properties of halide perovskites with desirable functionalities and potential applications.
Results and discussion
The Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs were synthesized by employing a facile and green method using ethanol as the main solvent.6 The detailed experiments were provided in ESI.† The prepared Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs crystallize in the trigonal crystal structure with lattice parameters a = b = 7.957(5) Å, c = 9.836(2) Å and α = β = 90°, γ = 120°, which are consistent with the space group Pm1 (no. 164). The unit cell of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs is schematically described in Fig. 1a. Within the unit cell, the eight corners of the unit cell are occupied by eight Cs+ ions, and two other Cs+ ions on the body diagonal of the unit cell. There are two [BiBr6]3− octahedra within the unit cell and each Bi atom occupies two-thirds of the octahedral voids. As shown in Fig. 1b and c, each octahedron is connected to other three octahedra forming 2D layered perovskites. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM images show a fringe spacing value of 0.33 nm, corresponding to (003) planes of structured Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs (Fig. S1†).

In addition, the band gap of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs was determined by UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 2a). Under ambient conditions, the absorption edge of the sample is located at 466 nm. With increasing pressure, the absorption edge exhibited a red-shift. The band gaps of the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs under ambient conditions and decompression are shown in Fig. S2.† The band gap of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs is about 2.66 eV under ambient conditions. The band gap of the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs underwent a continuously noticeable reduction from 2.66 eV to 1.97 eV upon compression, indicating that the 2D Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs have a flexible band gap tunability, even without any chemical modification. Note that the band gap decreases at a rate of 37.1 meV GPa−1 below 5.93 GPa, which is much slower than the narrowing rate of 88.4 meV GPa−1 at higher pressure, suggesting that the 2D Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs undergo a structure transition over a pressure interval from 5.93 GPa to 10.68 GPa. However, the band gap decreased at an obviously slower rate of 5.6 meVGPa−1 when the pressure reaches 19.5 GPa, which may be owing to the reduced crystallinity of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs. In the process of pressure relief, the band gap gradually approaches the initial state (Fig. S3†). Upon the complete release of pressure, the band gap is slightly smaller than the initial state, which should be related to the incomplete recrystallization process.

The in situ high-pressure Raman scattering spectra of the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs are shown in Fig. 3a. The main vibration modes of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs are related to the [Bi2Br9]3− cluster. Among them, the strongest Raman band of A1g symmetry at about 192.6 cm−1 corresponds to the νs BiBr2 vibration, the Raman band at 167 cm−1 of Eg symmetry is assigned to the νa BiBr3 mode, and the weak depolarised Raman band at 89 cm−1 (νs BrBi2) is assigned to the stretching modes of the BrBi2 groups (Table S1†).27 It is rather difficult to assign the bands below 80 cm−1, because they are not only related to the deformation modes of the Br–Bi arrangements, but also affected by the translational modes of the Cs+ cations. Upon compression, all Raman peaks of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs initiate a continuous shift to a higher wavenumber, owing to the reduction of the interatomic distance. Note that when the pressure reaches ca. 5.6 GPa, two Raman bands at 192.5 cm−1 and 217.7 cm−1 are enhanced, while the modes of Eg and A1g are weakened, indicating the occurrence of phase transformation. When the pressure reaches 9.30 GPa, the initial Raman modes decrease, followed by merging into the background. The coexistence of two phases indicates the sluggish phase transition within the pressure range from 5.6 GPa to 9.3 GPa. When the pressure exceeds ca. 14.5 GPa, all Raman peaks exhibit a wide diffraction background, indicating occurrence of structural amorphization. Furthermore, when the pressure is completely released, the Raman spectra recover to their initial state, suggesting a reversible phase transition. The Raman shift of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs as a function of pressure is shown in Fig. 3b. It is found that all of the vibration modes show a linear relationship with the pressure. Pressure coefficient χ is directly depicted by the slope of the straight line.28 The pressure coefficients χ and frequency differences of the vibration modes are summarized in Table S2.†

In order to figure out the relationship between the optical properties and structure of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs, the in situ high-pressure angle dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction (ADXRD) experiments were performed at room temperature. The ADXRD data under pressure are shown in Fig. 4a. Under ambient conditions, the refined ADXRD pattern (Fig. S4†) demonstrated that the initial Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs crystallized in a trigonal structure with the space group P3m1 (a = b = 7.957(5) Å, c = 9.836(2) Å). Upon compression, all Bragg diffraction peaks of the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs shift toward higher diffraction angles, owing to the contraction in the volume under pressure. When the pressure reaches 6.0 GPa, the splitting of the diffraction peak at about 13.9° indicates that the pressure-induced phase transition begins. The Rietveld refinement profiles of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs at ambient pressure, 10.1 GPa and R1atm show that the well-refined simulated ADXRD patterns are in good agreement with experimental data (Fig. 4b). It was observed that the well-fitted ADXRD pattern at 10.1 GPa can be clearly indexed to the monoclinic structure, which is consistent with the space group C2/c with lattice parameters a = 12.972(5) b = 7.176(3) Å and c = 18.786(3) Å and α = 90° β = 88.84°, and γ = 90°. The corresponding refined cell parameters and refined statistics at ambient pressure and 10.1 GPa for Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs are listed in Table S3.† The ADXRD patterns confirmed that the pristine trigonal phase starts to transform into a monoclinic phase (Fig. 4c). The crystal structure unit cells in the bc, ac and ab planes of the two phases are shown in Fig. S5.† Moreover, this pressure point at which the phase transition occurs matched well with the variation of the band gap of the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs under high pressure. Furthermore, the splitting of the diffraction peak completed at 10.1 GPa, indicating that the mixed phases of phases I and II co-existed until 10.1 GPa. Along with the applied pressure increase, some Bragg diffraction peaks decreased, even disappeared in the diffraction pattern, indicating the deteriorated crystallinity resulting from the disordered rearrangement [Bi2Br9]3− cluster. Upon decompression, the released ADXRD pattern recovered its initial structure, illustrating the reversibility of the pressure-induced phase transition (Fig. S6†). Meanwhile, the diffraction peaks of the recovered sample are obviously broadened and weakened, even partially disappearing. This indicated the incomplete recrystallization and the presence of a residual amorphous phase in the quenched sample. The incomplete recrystallization process should be responsible for the smaller band gap after releasing pressure to ambient conditions.

To further analyze the structural evolution of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs under pressure, the variations in the lattice parameters of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs upon compression are shown in Fig. 5a. Cell parameters of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs are monotonously decreased before the onset of phase transition. High-pressure compressibility is always used to evaluate a structure's sensitivity to pressure and its ability to contract in a particular direction.29 High-pressure compressibilities of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs are shown in Fig. 5b. With increasing pressure, the compressibility of lattice parameters decreased gradually, owing to the more compact structure under high pressure. It is observed that the compressibility of the a-axis is bigger than that of the c-axis. The exceptionally anisotropic compressibilities are attributed to the unique puckered layer-structure of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs. In addition, the same compressibility indicatrix of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs in the ab plane indicates that the in-layer structure has no obvious anisotropy (Fig. 5c). Furthermore, the experimental pressure–volume (P–V) data under high pressure were fitted using the third order Birch–Murnaghan equation: (1)where V0 is the volume at zero-pressure, B0 is the bulk modulus at ambient pressure, and  is a parameter for the pressure derivative. With  fitted as 4, the bulk modulus (B0) for the trigonal phase of the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs was estimated as 18.3(0) GPa. For the monoclinic structure, the bulk modulus B0 (455.3(8) GPa) was much larger than the initial phase, which can be attributed to the more defective barriers generated by the structural phase transformation. Moreover, the Grüneisen parameter (γ) is widely used because it can reflect typical characteristics of material properties. According to the anharmonic principle of the interatomic potential, the rate of change of phonon frequency relative to pressure can be expressed as γ, which can be calculated using a formula as follows: (2)where γ is the Grüneisen parameter, B0 is the bulk modulus of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs, ω0 is the intercept of the linear fit of Raman vibration modes versus applied pressure, and  is the slope of the linear fit. The results of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs with increasing pressure are shown in Table S4.† It was observed that the Grüneisen parameters after 10.1 GPa were significantly greater than the initial ones, indicating the structural changes, accompanied by the change of phonon energy.

We further performed first-principles calculations with density functional theory (DFT) for the band structures in order to acquire insight into the relationship between the structure and properties of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs. As shown in Fig. 6a, the calculated electronic band structure demonstrates that the band gap of Cs3Bi2Br9 is 2.66 eV under ambient conditions. It is observed that the valence band maximum (VBM) originates from the orbital interactions of Br 4p and Bi 6s. The conduction band minimum (CBM) of Cs3Bi2Br9 is dominated by Br 4p and Bi 6p orbital interactions. The optical properties of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs are mainly affected by the Bi–Br skeleton, because it affects the overlap of wave functions.30 Accordingly, we further investigate the pressure-dependent Bi–Br bond lengths and Br–Bi–Br bond angles within the Bi–Br octahedra (Fig. 6b and c). In this 2D perovskite crystal structure, the Br ions in different chemical environments are defined as Br1 and Br2, respectively. Therein, L1 and L2 are defined as the lengths of the Bi–Br1 bonds, and the Bi–Br2 (Fig. S7†). The Bi–Br1 bonds involving Br1 atoms are located on the bridge connecting two Bi atoms in the inorganic framework, while θ denotes the Br–Bi–Br bond angle (Fig. 6c). As the pressure increases to 5.0 GPa, all Bi–Br bonds and the Br–Bi–Br bond angle gradually decrease, indicating that the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs are compressed and the adjacent [BiBr6]3− octahedra get closer under pressure. Both the reductions of the Bi–Br bond length and Br–Bi–Br bond angle will enhance the electron cloud overlap between the Bi and Br orbitals. Therefore, electronic band dispersion increases accompanied by the CBM decreasing and the VBM increasing, eventually resulting in the reduction in the band gap.25 When the pressure is in the range of 5.0 GPa and 10.1 GPa, the sudden increase of the band gap with the change rate of pressure results from the external pressure-induced structural distortion. As the pressure exceeds 10.1 GPa, although the bond angle starts to increase with pressure, the band gap eventually decreases with the rate of change of pressure due to the decreasing trend of all bond lengths.

Conclusions
To sum up, the pressure-engineered structure and optical properties of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs were methodically studied by high-pressure technology. We narrowed the band gap of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs to 1.97 eV under pressure. The narrowed band gap originates from the variation of the Bi–Br bond and Br–Bi–Br bond angle enhancing atomic orbital coupling. Combining ADXRD patterns with in situ Raman spectra manifested that the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs experienced a phase transition from the trigonal phase to monoclinic structure at ca. 6.0 GPa. The change rate of the pressure-dependent band gap increases at 6.0 GPa originating from the structural phase transition. First-principles calculations further indicate that variations of band gaps are mainly influenced by the orbital interactions, which is related to the distortion of the [Bi2Br9]3− octahedral network under pressure. The results of the analysis agree very well with the experimental results. High pressure, as an efficient tool, can be used to adjust the structure and properties of halide perovskites with desirable functionalities and potential applications.
