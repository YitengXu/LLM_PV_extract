    , Accepted 7th May 2021First published on 8th May 2021AbstractThere is great potential for photodynamic therapy (PDT)-enhanced photothermal therapy (PTT) to be used for tumor therapy, especially for the single material-mediated process that could greatly simplify the experimental arrangements. This study presents a new cancer phototherapeutic agent consisting of low-work-function lanthanum hexaboride particles, which are excellent light absorbers in the near-infrared (NIR) region. The photothermal effect and reactive oxygen species production were realized by LaB6 under NIR light irradiation. Theoretical calculations based on density functional theory confirmed that the strong NIR light absorption by LaB6 was attributed to the local plasmonic resonance effect and the excellent photodynamic effect derived from the low work function. In vivo treatment of HepG2 tumor-bearing mice revealed that LaB6-mediated phototherapy resulted in excellent tumor inhibitory effects, and no adverse effects on mice were observed. These results indicate that LaB6 is a promising phototherapeutic agent for cancer synergetic phototherapy.
1. Introduction
There are significant advantages such as low side effects that accompany the use of phototherapy for clinical cancer treatment when compared to the treatment approaches of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.1–3 As a representative of phototherapy, photothermal therapy (PTT) is the most effective because tumors have poor heat tolerance.4–7 To achieve the desired depth of penetration, the use of near-infrared (NIR) light at 800–1300 nm is optimal due to the limited light absorption and scattering by body tissues in this optical window.8,9
To enhance cancer treatment outcomes, multifunctional nanoplatforms that combined other therapeutic effects of photodynamic-, chemo-, chemodynamic-, and ultrasound-therapy with PTT have been developed in recent years.10–15 It is doubtless that integrating photothermal agents with other therapeutic agents can enhance the antitumor effect, but the addition of numerous synthetic and operational steps is an obvious disadvantage due to the increased difficulty in developing a successful protocol. Among these synergistic treatments, the combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT)/PTT has been intensively studied. However, some attempts to develop synergistic PTT/PDT treatment required simultaneous excitation with lasers of different wavelengths, which increases the complexity of the operation.16,17 In the consideration of these foregoing factors, single nanomaterial-mediated synergistic oncotherapy is more preferable.
For PDT, the photosensitizer (PS) triggers a photochemical reaction that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) for the purpose of destroying lysosomes or causing damage to nucleic acids, which subsequently results in necrosis or apoptosis/death of cancer cells.18,19 For an effective photodynamic process, the generation of ROS should be easily achieved during the PDT process, in which charge transfer between PS and oxygen molecules along with energy transfer is expected.20,21 Therefore, materials that can easily donate electrons, such as low-work-function materials, may exhibit good PDT performance.
Work function is the minimum energy required to move an electron from the inside of a material to the surface. For a material with a low work function, less energy is required for electrons to escape from the constraint of the material, and therefore, excited electrons that activate oxygen molecules are easily generated. Due to their unique electronic properties, low-work-function materials have been widely used in field emission materials,22 organic light-emitting diodes,23 solar cells,24–26 and photocatalysts.27,28
It was reported that ultrathin MgO growing on an Ag surface had a low work function of 3.7 eV, and its (001) surface was conducive to superoxide anion formation.29 Ti3C2Tx has been shown to have a low work function (3.4 eV), and a flow of photogenerated electrons was generated by Ti3C2Tx under the irradiation of solar light to achieve efficient photocatalytic decomposition of water.27 More relevantly, WN was proved to generate reactive oxygen constituents under NIR light excitation because the low work function provides a low energy barrier.28 These examples provide ample evidence that low-work-function materials tend to generate ROS. Therefore, low work function becomes a criterion for ROS generation.
LaB6 is well-known as a field emitter because of its low work function (approximately 2.7 eV), enabling it to efficiently emit electrons.30–32 Nano-sized LaB6 has strong NIR light absorption and excellent photothermal conversion ability, and therefore, LaB6 is qualified as a photothermal agent as well.33,34 Thus, LaB6 has the potential to achieve synergetic phototherapy.
In this work, LaB6 particles with low work function and strong NIR absorbance were employed as phototherapeutic agents. The mechanisms of photoabsorption and ROS generation were investigated by density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations. Hyperthermia and on-site ROS can be generated by LaB6 upon NIR excitation, leading to a remarkable PTT/PDT synergistic effect for both in vitro and in vivo tumor treatments. As expected, LaB6 showed outstanding tumor inhibition ability and caused no noticeable systemic toxicity, as evidenced by hematological analysis. Compared with traditional photothermal materials, LaB6 possesses additional photosensitive advantages, with an even greater quantum yield than that of standard photosensitizers of indocyanine green (ICG) dye (Scheme 1).

2. Results and discussion
Characterization of LaB6
In this work, we first morphologically characterized an LaB6 sample. As shown in Fig. 1a, LaB6 consists of many irregularly shaped particles with varied sizes. A high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1b) shows the clear crystal fringe of 0.420 nm, corresponding to the (100) crystal facet of cubic LaB6. The select area electronic diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1c) displays regular lattices and adjacent spots that are attributable to (100), (010), and (110) facets. Moreover, SAED also indicates the high crystallinity of LaB6. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis (Fig. 1d–f) verified that LaB6 is composed of boron and lanthanum elements.

For reflecting the actual dimension of LaB6 in an aqueous solution, the hydrodynamic diameter of LaB6 was tested via dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement, which was determined to be 340 nm on average (Fig. 1g), and is a suitable size for further in vivo administration. Then, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to investigate the crystal nature of the sample. Obviously, all the characteristic Bragg peaks can be indexed to the cubic structure of standard LaB6 (PDF34-0427; Fig. 1h) without any impurities.

Fig. 1i shows the Raman spectra of LaB6. The Raman peaks at 677 cm−1, 1116 cm−1, and 1246 cm−1 correspond to T2g, Eg, and A1g of LaB6, respectively, while the spectral peak at 1378 cm−1 usually appears in trivalent and intermediate-valent crystals.35 Next, the chemical valence of LaB6 was determined via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The peaks at the binding energies of 835.7 eV and 853.7 eV were assigned to the La 3d5/2 and La 3d3/2 of La3+ ions (Fig. 1j), which showed good coincidence with issued literature.36
Theoretical calculation
Theoretical prediction of the electronic structure and photoabsorption mechanism of LaB6 was performed. A 3 × 2 × 2 cubic supercell model of LaB6 was constructed based on density functional theory (DFT) using the CASTEP source code for calculation. First, the structure was optimized. The cut-off energy of the structure was set at 400 eV, while the energy convergence limit was set at 1 × 10−6 eV. The supercell obtained after structural optimization is shown in Fig. 2a.

The [B6] structural unit is a regular octahedral structure composed of six B atoms. The eight cube vertex angles of each [B6] unit are occupied by La atoms, forming a simple cubic crystal structure. The La ions are caged in the electronegative grid of [B6] units, which can be easily seen from the electron density difference (EDD) shown in Fig. 2b. The band structure and density of electronic states (DOS) of LaB6 were calculated as shown in Fig. 2c, which indicates that −2 eV to −10 eV is the orbital filling of La, and that there is no bonding here. We also determined that 0 to 6 eV is the overlap of La and B as the hybridization state. The continuous electron state occupation near the Fermi level proved that LaB6 is a metallic material.
These results suggested that LaB6 is a conductor with metal-like properties.37 By further calculating the dielectric function of LaB6, the real part (ε1) and the imaginary part (ε2) are shown in Fig. 2d. Thus, ε1 = 0 corresponds to the energy absorption peak of local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), and hence the region where ε1 < 0 undergoes the LSPR effect.38 As shown in Fig. 2d, the energy of ε1 < 0 ranges from 0.55 eV to 2 eV and corresponds to wavelength ranges from 600 nm to 2300 nm. These results show that the strong optical absorption in the NIR region is due to the LSPR effect. The calculated optical absorption spectra of LaB6 in Fig. 2e shows that LaB6 strongly absorbs light in the NIR region.
Work function (Φ) of LaB6 is calculated by the constructed model, as shown in Fig. 2f. Φ of LaB6 was calculated as 2.59 eV according to the difference between the vacuum level and Fermi level.39,40 The work function of LaB6 is lower than that of common metals and compounds, which indicates that LaB6 is an excellent electron emission material and potential electron donor.
Light absorption and photothermal properties of LaB6
Optical absorption in the NIR region and related photothermal properties are basic requirements for LaB6 to realize photothermal therapy. Thus, we first inspected the optical absorption properties of LaB6, which exhibited excellent dispersion in water (Fig. S1, ESI†). The absorbance of an aqueous dispersion of LaB6 in deionized water is shown in Fig. 3a. It was found that the absorbance value is proportional to the concentration of LaB6. In addition, it was easily discerned that the optical absorbance of the LaB6 aqueous dispersion was quite consistent with the DFT calculation in Fig. 2e. Considering that LaB6 exhibits outstanding absorption in the entire NIR region, this may signify that it is capable of a prominent photothermal performance. Gradient concentrations of LaB6 dispersions were exposed to a NIR laser (880 nm) for 10 min, and the photothermal properties were monitored by an FL-IR System i7 infrared camera. As expected, LaB6 dispersions showed prominent temperature elevation in response to NIR irradiation (Fig. 3b). Representative thermographic images are shown in Fig. 3c and d.

(a) Optical absorbance of LaB6 aqueous dispersion at various concentrations, (b) temperature change (ΔT) of the LaB6 dispersions under NIR laser irradiation; water was used as the control (880 nm, 3.64 W cm−2), (c) thermographic images of water and LaB6 aqueous dispersion of 125 μg mL−1, (d) and (e) the curve of heating and cooling, the curve of time versus −ln(θ) for LaB6 aqueous dispersion of 125 μg mL−1, and (f) cyclic heating curve of the LaB6 dispersion. 
It is clear that the temperature of the LaB6 dispersion (125 μg mL−1) increased to 24.8 °C, while water was only 3.8 °C. The photothermal conversion efficiency (η) was calculated to be 41.35% (Fig. 3e) according to eqn (1)–(3) (the derivation is shown in the ESI†).41 The η of LaB6 was not outstanding as compared with the recent data of other photothermal materials (e.g., 56.6% of Fe2P,42 63.3% of Cu2MoS4,43 and 89% of CoFeMn dichalcogenide nanosheets44). However, it indicated that a greater amount of photon energy remained for ROS generation. In addition, there was no apparent temperature change after six heating–cooling cycles, which demonstrated the excellent photothermal stability of LaB6 (Fig. 3f). The XRD pattern of the LaB6 sample before and after NIR irradiation also proved this point (Fig. S2, ESI†). These results indicated that LaB6 can act as an efficient photothermal agent. (1) (2) (3)Tmax denotes the maximum temperature to which the LaB6 dispersion rose (54.8 °C); TSurr denotes the room temperature (30 °C); h denotes the heat transfer coefficient; A denotes the surface area of the quartz tube; Qdis denotes the heat dissipated from light absorbed by the quartz sample cell (0.084 W); I denotes the incident laser power (1.029 W); Aλ denotes the absorbance of the LaB6 dispersion at 880 nm (1.324); τs denotes the time constant (106.53 s); t denotes cooling time; θ indicates a dimensionless driving force temperature; md denotes the mass of dispersion (0.5 g); and cd denotes the specific heat of water (4.2 J g−1 °C−1).
ROS generation ability of LaB6
It is well known that the activation of oxygen molecules requires that they trap electrons, which is an important step in the production of ROS. The electrons of LaB6 are easily excited and exit the lattice due to its low Φ value, which readily facilitates ROS generation. The charge transfer (Δq) between an O2 molecule and different facets of LaB6 was studied by Mulliken charge. The changes in charge of oxygen molecules adsorbed on the (100), (110), and (111) facets of LaB6 are +1.47e−, +0.65e−, and −0.26e−, as shown in Fig. 4a–c, where green represents charge accumulation (Δq > 0) and yellow represents charge depletion (Δq < 0).

It is clear that LaB6 exhibited excellent electron affinity when oxygen molecules were adsorbed on the (100) and (110) facets, especially for the (100) facet, which can transfer the most charges. The above results suggested that oxygen molecules can effectively obtain electrons from the surfaces of LaB6. It is reasonable that upon NIR irradiation, a large number of photo-induced electrons can be excited due to the strong light absorption by LaB6 in the NIR region, and then, these photo-induced electrons can be used for oxygen molecule activation to generate ROS.
Next, we tested the ROS generation mediated by LaB6. The selected probes were 2′,7′-dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF). When DCFH-DA is oxidized into DCF by ROS, luminescence at 520 nm is emitted.45 The fluorescence spectra shown in Fig. 4d clearly display the formation of DCF mediated by LaB6 under NIR excitation, and thus prove that generation of ROS by LaB6 occurred in the system. Furthermore, the ESR spectra shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) display a triplex resonant peak in the range of 3480–3530 Gs, thus proving that 1O2 generation mediated by LaB6 occurred under NIR 880 irradiation. The DPBF probe was degraded in the presence of 1O2, resulting in its optical absorption loss at 410 nm.45 As shown in Fig. 4e, photoexcited LaB6 led to an obvious absorption decrease of DPBF as compared to deionized water, suggesting that LaB6 possesses excellent PDT efficiency for 1O2 generation. Then, the quantum yield of LaB6 was quantified with reference to ICG (the 1O2 quantum yield φICG = 0.0020, at 808 nm), which is a widely used photosensitizer.
The 1O2 yield at 808 nm (φ808) can be determined by the following formula:46 (4)where φICG denotes the 1O2 quantum yield for the standard ICG, and k808 and kICG denote the DPBF photobleaching rates in the presence of LaB6 and standard ICG at 808 nm, respectively. Iabs 808 and Iabs ICG denote the absorbance by LaB6 and standard ICG at 808 nm, respectively.
Using this method, we first obtained φ808 = 0.0045 (Fig. S4, ESI†). Then, the 1O2 quantum yields at 880 nm and 1064 nm were finally determined by the below eqn (5) and (6) as φ880 = 0.0038 and φ1064 = 0.0036, respectively, indicating that the 1O2 generation mediated by LaB6 was much more efficient than that of the typical ICG. (5) (6)
Then, the intracellular ROS production of LaB6 was measured by a fluorescence method. DCFH-DA was introduced again as a probe, as the green fluorescence of DCF can be observed by fluorescence microscope. HepG2 cancer cells in satisfactory condition were divided into the control group (without any treatment), NIR-880 group (NIR-880 nm irradiation for 10 min), LaB6 group (incubated with culture medium containing LaB6), H2O2 group (incubated with culture medium containing H2O2), LaB6 + NIR-880 group (incubated with culture medium containing LaB6 and irradiated with NIR-880 nm), and LaB6 + NIR-880 + NaN3 group (NaN3 served as an ROS quencher).
As shown in Fig. 5, no fluorescence was observed in the LaB6 group or the control group, proving that there was no intracellular ROS generation under these two treatment conditions. Sporadic fluorescence was observed in the NIR-880 group, which indicated that a very small amount of ROS could be produced under the excitation of NIR-880 nm. Obvious green fluorescence was observed in the H2O2-positive control and the LaB6 + NIR-880 group, indicating that the material could produce ROS under irradiation. In contrast, no fluorescence was generated in the LaB6 + NIR-880 + NaN3 group, which was caused by the ROS quenching effect of sodium azide. These results illustrated that LaB6 was able to generate ROS in tumour cells, thus realizing cancer photodynamic therapy.

Tumor phototherapeutic investigation
It is necessary for a phototherapy agent to have low cytotoxicity under non-irradiated conditions. In this work, HepG2 (a human liver carcinoma cell line) cells were used for the phototherapy study, and we performed the MTT assay to investigate the cytotoxicity of LaB6 towards HepG2 in the dark, which indicated low cytotoxicity (Fig. S5, ESI†). Then, the cell viability was determined by Calcein-AM/propidium iodide (PI) staining to evaluate the efficiency of phototherapy.
HepG2 cells in culture dishes were divided into 7 groups for different treatments. The control group and the NIR group were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) for 24 h, while the remaining groups were cultured in medium with LaB6 for 24 h. After culturing, different illumination treatments were applied to different groups. The fluorescence images of the control group and the NIR-irradiated group are shown in Fig. 6a and b, and there was no red fluorescence. This indicates that there was little death of cancer cells after applying only laser irradiation. Similar results were observed for the LaB6 group (Fig. 6c) as well, and there was no significant difference in the cell growth status between the LaB6 group and the control group. This is in accordance with the MTT result that the cytotoxicity for LaB6 was not significant without irradiation. Fig. 6d–g shows the staining images of LaB6-treated cells exposed to NIR-880 at different times at the light boundary. The cells at the light boundary gradually changed from green to red with increasing time, and the green fluorescence in the light boundary almost completely disappeared when the irradiation duration reached 6 min, indicating massive cell death. After 10 min of irradiation, all the cells exhibited red fluorescence, indicating that all HepG2 cells were dead (Fig. 6h). These results suggested that LaB6-mediated phototherapy exerted a significant in vitro antitumor effect.

(a–h) Fluorescence microscopy images of Calcein-AM and PI co-stained cells after receiving different treatments, (i) relative viability of HepG2 cells after different treatments, including the untreated group, only PDT group, only PTT group, and the PDT/PTT combined group. 
To confirm the individual contribution of PTT or PDT in LaB6-mediated phototherapy, the cell viabilities with PDT alone, PTT alone, and PDT/PTT combined therapy were tested using the MTT method. Cell viabilities after different treatments are shown in Fig. 6i. In the PDT/PTT combined group, approximately 80% of the tumor cells died. To determine the contribution of PTT, NaN3 was introduced as an ROS quenching agent during phototherapy to eradicate the influence of ROS. The results measured in this way showed approximately 62% HepG2 cell death, resulting in a lower mortality rate than that of PDT/PTT combined therapy.
To study the effect of PDT with LaB6-mediated phototherapy, LaB6 was set in an ice bath to ensure that the temperature was <20 °C in the irradiation area. By eliminating the effects of hyperthemia, PDT caused approximately 25% cell death. Based on the above results, it can be concluded that PDT/PTT synergistic treatment can be achieved through single substance use of LaB6 with single wavelength NIR excitation, and the synergistic therapeutic effect was stronger than that obtained by sole use of PDT or PTT.
Next, the in vivo antitumor effect of LaB6 was investigated. Twenty nude mice bearing HepG2 tumors of approximately 200 mm3 were randomly divided into four groups. The temperature changes of the mice in the NIR group and LaB6 + NIR group during the light irradiation were recorded by a FLIR (Fig. 7a). As shown in Fig. 7b, the temperature at the tumor site of the mice in the NIR group increased to a maximum of 7.4 °C within 10 min, while the tumor temperature of the mice in the LaB6 + NIR group increased 17 °C within 10 min, which demonstrated a satisfactory photoinduced heating effect. For the next 14 days, the tumor changes in the mice were recorded by photographing and measuring (Fig. 7c and d) the tumor volume.

(a) Thermographic images and (b) corresponding temperature variations at the tumor site under NIR irradiation with and without LaB6, (c) representative images and tumors removed on the 14th day, (d) relative tumor volumes, and (e) relative body weights of mice after different treatments. 
These results indicated that the antitumor effect of the LaB6-mediated phototherapy was remarkable, and was equivalent to the complete removal of a solid tumor. Moreover, the relative body weight changes of the mice in the four groups in 14 days exhibited the same tendency, proving no acute toxicity of the phototherapy. After the animal experiment, hemanalysis of the mice in the four groups was performed to test the biosafety of LaB6. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), all the blood indexes were within the allowed reference ranges, also indicating that there was no acute toxicity from LaB6 treatment. Then, the major organs, including the liver, lung, heart, kidney, and spleen, were harvested for H&E staining. No organs exhibited any obvious pathological changes upon H&E staining (Fig. S7, ESI†), proving the safety and feasibility of the phototherapy mediated by LaB6.
3. Conclusions
In summary, low-work function LaB6 was employed as a therapeutic agent for photodynamic-enhanced photothermal therapy. The ROS generation ability of LaB6 enabled by low work function was confirmed by theoretical simulation and experimental observation. The experimental results demonstrated that satisfying antitumor effects were achieved by single LaB6in vitro and in vivo. In addition, LaB6 showed excellent biological compatibility as verified by no significant cytotoxicity, hematotoxicity, or tissue toxicity.
4. Experimental
Materials
LaB6 was synthesized by Shanghai CW-Nano Company. 2′7-Dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA), indocyanine green (ICG), and 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Calcein-AM, propidium iodide (PI), and 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) were purchased from Summus.
Characterization
TEM images were taken with a JEM 2100F. The optical tests were performed with a Shimadzu UV-2600. The crystal nature and chemical valence of LaB6 were investigated by XRD (X’PERT), Raman spectra (BWS345), and XPS spectra (ESCALAB 250Xi). Temperature changes were recorded by an infrared camera (FLIR System i7).
Photothermal effect and photostability
For the photothermal test, LaB6 was prepared as 31.3, 62.5, 125, and 250 μg mL−1 aqueous dispersions. Next, 0.5 mL of the dispersion was added to a quartz tube, and NIR-880 nm laser irradiation was vertically applied for 10 min. The temperature of dispersion was recorded with an infrared camera every 30 s. To obtain the photothermal conversion efficiency, the laser was removed after 10 min of irradiation, and the temperature over the 10 min cooling period was recorded. The irradiation and cooling were repeated six times to test the photostability of LaB6.
ROS detection
DCFH-DA was used for ROS detection in the LaB6 aqueous dispersion. DCFH-DA (1.6 mg) and KOH (0.11 g) were dissolved in alcohol (1.5 mL) and deionized water (1.5 mL), respectively, in a cuvette. LaB6 (3 mg) was added to this system, and the mixture was agitated on a magnetic stirrer. A dark environment was required to eliminate background influence during the experiment. Then, an NIR-880 nm laser (3.64 W cm−2) was applied, and 0.1 mL of the mixture was removed every 10 min for the fluorescence spectra test. DPBF was also adopted for ROS detection, whereby 30 μL of DPBF solution (1 mg mL−1) was added to 2.5 mL of LaB6 dispersion, which was then treated with NIR-880 nm laser irradiation (3.64 W cm−2). The absorption of this mixture at 0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 40 min, and 60 min was subsequently measured.
DCFH-DA was employed again for the intracellular ROS detection. HepG2 cells were divided into 6 groups that received different treatments: the control group (untreated), NIR-880 group (treated with laser irradiation only, 3.64 W cm−2), LaB6 group (culture medium contained LaB6 at 0.25 mg mL−1), H2O2 group (culture medium contained H2O2), LaB6 + NIR-880 group (phototherapy), and LaB6 + NIR-880 + NaN3 group (phototherapy + NaN3). After receiving different treatments, 50 μg of DCFH-DA solution was added to each group, and the cells were cultured for 1 h. Cells were imaged by a fluorescence microscope (BX53, Olympus).
Cytotoxicity test
A standard MTT assay was adopted for the cytotoxicity test. HepG2 cells were seeded into 96-well plates and co-incubated for 24 h with DMEM medium containing different concentrations of LaB6. Then, 20 μL MTT solution was added to each well for another 4 hours of incubation. After that, the medium in each well was replaced by 150 μL of DMSO, and the plate was further incubated for another 30 min. Finally, the absorbance was recorded by a microplate reader (SynergyTM HT, BioTek Instruments Inc., USA). A standard MTT assay was adopted to distinguish the contribution of PTT and PDT. After incubation, HepG2 cells in three groups all received phototherapy mediated by LaB6. For the PTT group, 50 μL of NaN3 solution (10 mM) was introduced before irradiation to eliminate the influence of ROS. For the PDT group, an ice bath was employed to ensure that no hyperthermia was generated.

In vitro phototherapy
Well-cultured HepG2 cells were incubated with LaB6 (250 μg mL−1) for 6 h. The cells were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times to remove excess LaB6, and then, fresh culture medium was added to each dish. Cells in the different dishes received NIR-880 laser irradiation (3.64 W cm−2) of different durations (2, 4, 6, and 10 min). The cells were stained with 200 μL of Calcein-AM (1 μg mL−1) and PI (20 μg mL−1) for 20 min and then imaged with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX53).

In vivo phototherapy
All animal experiments were implemented according to the criteria of the National Regulation of China for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Ethics Research Committee of the Harbin Institute of Technology (No. IACUC-2019009). Female BALB/c nude mice were purchased from the Vital River Experimental Animal Technical Co., Ltd (Beijing).
Tumor models were established by injecting HepG2 cells into the left flank of the leg of each mice. When the tumor grew to the correct size (approximately 200 mm3, V = length × width2), the mice were divided into 4 groups: (1) the untreated group, (2) NIR irradiation group, (3) LaB6 treated group, and (4) LaB6 + NIR irradiation group. Then, 100 μL of LaB6 dispersion (1 mg mL−1) was injected into the tumor sites of the mice in groups 3 and 4, while 100 μL of PBS was applied in groups 1 and 2 as a control. Approximately 2 h later, NIR-880 nm laser irradiation (3.64 W cm−2) was administered to groups 2 and 4 for 10 min. The body weights and tumor volumes of mice were recorded daily for the following 14 days. The blood (20 μL) of the mice was collected and measured by an automatic blood analyzer (HF-3800).
Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
The tumor and major organs (liver, kidney, heart, lung, and spleen) were excised from the mice, fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution, and then embedded in paraffin. The sliced tissues were stained with H&E and imaged with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX53).
