    , Accepted 4th January 2022First published on 4th January 2022AbstractIn this work, the electron–phonon, phonon–phonon, and phonon structure scattering mechanisms and their effect on the thermal and thermoelectric properties of a silver nanowire (AgNW) is investigated in the temperature range of 10 to 300 K. The electron–phonon scattering rate decreases with the increase of temperature. The phonon–phonon scattering rate increases with temperature and becomes greater than the electron–phonon scattering rate when the temperature is higher than the Debye temperature (223 K). The rate of phonon structure scattering is constant. The total phonon scattering rate decreases with temperature when the temperature is lower than about 150 K, and increases when the temperature is higher than 150 K. Correspondingly, the temperature dependent variation trend of the lattice thermal conductivity is opposite diametrically to that of the total phonon scattering rate. The thermoelectric properties of the AgNW are strongly coupled with the thermal conductivity via the phonon and electron transition. The thermoelectric properties of the material are quantified by the figure of merit (ZT). The ZT value of the AgNW is greater than that of bulk silver in the corresponding temperature range, and this difference increases with temperature. The order of the ZT of the AgNW is about 13 times greater than that of bulk silver at room temperature. The large increase of the ZT value of the AgNW is mainly due to the enhanced electron scattering and phonon scattering mechanisms in the AgNW.
Introduction
The nanostructuring technique presents a promising way to investigate the thermal and thermoelectric properties of a single metal nanowire. The metal nanowire has great potential for applications like flexible touch screen, solar cells and transparent electrodes.1,2 The capabilities of those electronic devices are restricted by the thermal and thermoelectric properties of the metal nanowire. All of them are related to the phonon transport process in the metal nanowire. Due to the increase in the surface-to-volume ratio, the relative contribution of phonon surface scattering in nanostructures is enhanced.3 This behavior was caused by increased scattering of heat carriers with structural defects and by the substantial contribution of the thermal conductivity.4 Thermal conductivity is an important factor influencing the thermoelectric properties of nanomaterials. Hence, the phonon scattering mechanism must be considered in the research of the thermoelectric properties of nanomaterials.5,6 The discussion of the phonon scattering effect on the thermal and thermoelectric properties of AgNW is beneficial to the nanomaterial thermoelectric properties research in theory and application.
Recently, some breakthroughs in the research of the phonon scattering mechanism effect on the thermal and thermoelectric properties of nanomaterials have been made. For instance, the temperature determines the wavelength of the phonon and the phonon scattering mechanism,7 resulting in the temperature dependent thermal and thermoelectric properties of metal nanowires. Besides, the thermal and thermoelectric properties of nanomaterials are sensitive to phonon structural scattering (the grain boundaries of the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and the surface of the silver nanowire (AgNW)).8 However, due to the different mechanisms of carrier scattering in nanomaterials and the corresponding bulk materials,9,10 it is very challenging to determine the thermoelectric properties of individual metallic nanowires. In particular, many efforts are focused on how to improve the thermoelectric properties of the material based on Ziman's formula,11 which is apparently insufficient for a modern understanding.12,13 Therefore, more work needs to be done for understanding the physical nature of the phonon scattering mechanism effect on the thermal and thermoelectric properties of nanomaterials.
In this work, based on the discussion of the electron–phonon, phonon–phonon, and phonon structure scattering mechanisms, the temperature dependent thermal conductivity and thermoelectric properties of the AgNW are investigated. The temperature dependent variation trend of the lattice thermal conductivity considering both electron–phonon scattering and phonon–phonon scattering processes is opposite diametrically to that of the corresponding scattering rate. The phonon structure scattering does not affect the temperature dependent variation trend of both total phonon scattering rate and lattice thermal conductivity. Besides, due to the effect of electron scattering and phonon scattering mechanisms in the AgNW, the thermoelectric properties of the AgNW are greatly improved relative to that of bulk silver.
Experiment
The AgNW is fabricated on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate using a two-beam laser direct writing system.14,15 In this fabricated system, the femtosecond pulse laser generates the AgNPs from silver ion aqueous solution due to multiphoton absorption16 and the CW laser forms the AgNW from the AgNPs.17 The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the AgNW with two electrical pads is shown in Fig. 1(a), and the length of the AgNW between the two pads is about 65 μm (L). The AgNW surface morphology is measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM) [Fig. 1(b)]. The cross section of the AgNW is nearly a triangle (Section S1, ESI†). The average height (h) and full width at half maximum (w) of the cross section are 142 ± 5 nm and 367 ± 12 nm, respectively. The inner structures of the AgNW are measured using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1(c), the AgNW is composed of AgNPs with an average grain size of about 10 nm.18,19Fig. 1(d) shows the (111) plane of the face-centered cubic crystal structure of the AgNPs.
 Fig. 1  (a) The SEM image, (b) the corresponding AFM image, (c) the TEM image, and (d) the HR-TEM image of the AgNW. 
The I–V curves of the AgNW are measured in a vacuum environment in the temperature range of 10 to 300 K using a Keithley 4200-SCS semiconductor system and a CRX-4K cryogenic probe station in a clean and shielded box in dark conditions. The measurement voltage varies from −0.1 V to 0.1 V, and the voltage interval is 0.004 V. The resistance of the AgNW is obtained from linear fitting of the I–V curves.
Results and discussion
Phonon scattering mechanisms
In the AgNW, a phonon can be scattered by other phonons, electrons and the structures (the grain boundaries and the surface of the AgNW). The corresponding total relaxation time (τp) of those scattering mechanisms can be combined according to Matthiessen's law if the coupling relations between them were not considered, which is given as τp−1 = τep−1 + τu−1 + τb−1,(1)where τep, τu and τb represent the relaxation time for electron–phonon scattering, anharmonic phonon–phonon scattering (Umklapp process) and phonon structure scattering, respectively.
The electron–phonon scattering is the dominant mechanism of phonon scattering at low temperatures (<100 K).12 The relaxation time for the electron–phonon scattering rate (τep−1) can be derived from Fermi's golden rule:12,13 (2)where m* is the density of states effective mass of the electrons (m* = 0.4me),20ED is the acoustic deformation potential (ED = 2.9 eV),21ρm is the mass density of the material, vs is the average sound velocity, g is the number of equivalent carrier pockets (g = 10),22 and ne is the electron concentration. Here, the electron concentration of the metals is expressed as ne = (1/3π2)·(2m*/ħ2)3/2·EF3/2, where EF is the Fermi energy of the AgNPs (EF = 3.1 eV).23 The temperature dependent electron–phonon scattering rate decreases with temperature in the temperature range of 10 to 300 K [Fig. 2 (green curve)]. In general, the phonon energy and the number density per unit primitive cell in the material increase with temperature,24,25 and the number of electron–phonon scattering times should increase. However, the phonon number density grows faster than the electron–phonon scattering times, and the scattering rate decreases relatively with the temperature increase.
 Fig. 2  The green, blue, violet, yellow, and red curves show the temperature dependent rates of electron–phonon scattering, anharmonic phonon–phonon scattering, both electron–phonon and phonon–phonon scattering, phonon structure scattering, and total scattering, respectively. 
The phonon–phonon Umklapp scattering is the dominant mechanism of phonon scattering in nanomaterials at high temperatures.26 The phonon scattering rate for the dominant anharmonic phonon–phonon Umklapp process can be expressed as27 (3)where ℏ is Planck's constant, γ is the Grüneisen constant (γ = 2.29),28ω is the angular frequency of the phonon, ma is the average mass of a single atom in the solid, and θD is the Debye temperature. As shown in Fig. 2 (blue curve), the temperature dependent phonon–phonon scattering rate (τu−1) of the AgNW increases with temperature in the range of 10 to 300 K. It begins to rise significantly when the temperature is higher than 100 K and becomes greater than the electron–phonon scattering rate when the temperature is higher than the Debye temperature (223 K) (Section S2, ESI†). That is to say, the phonon–phonon scattering is believed to dominate the phonon relaxation in the AgNW when the temperature is comparable to or above the Debye temperature.29
The relaxation time (τep+u) of both electron–phonon scattering and phonon–phonon scattering can be obtained according to Matthiessen's law (τep+u−1 = τep−1 + τu−1). The corresponding scattering rate (τep+u−1) decreases with temperature when the temperature is lower than about 150 K, and increases with temperature when the temperature is higher than 150 K [Fig. 2 (violet curve)].
For nanomaterials, the effect of the phonon structure scattering has to be considered. The size of the AgNW cross section (w) is in the scale of about 100 nm, which is composed of AgNPs with a size (d) of about 10 nm. The carrier surface and boundary scattering exists in the AgNW.30 The relaxation time (τb) of phonon structure scattering is given as31 (4)As predicted by theory, the scattering rate of the phonon structure is constant in the temperature range of 10 to 300 K [Fig. 2 (yellow curve)].
The temperature dependent variation trend of the total phonon scattering rate (τp−1) [Fig. 2 (red curve)] is similar to that of τep+u−1. This indicates that the phonon structure scattering does not affect the temperature dependent variation trend of τp−1. However, the effect on the value of τp−1 should not be neglected.
Thermal conductivity
The thermal conductivity includes contributions from both phonons and electrons, which are defined as lattice thermal conductivity and electronic thermal conductivity, respectively. The lattice thermal conductivity (kL) can be written as32 (5)where Cv is the specific heat capacity, which can be obtained in the extended Debye model:33 (6)where Rg is the perfect gas constant and κ is the fractal dimension, κ = 1 for nanowires.
The temperature dependent specific heat capacity of the AgNW is calculated using eqn (6) in the temperature range of 10 to 300 K. As shown in Fig. 3, the specific heat capacity increases faster with temperature at lower temperatures (<100 K), but rises very slowly with temperature at higher temperatures (>100 K), as the theory predicts that the specific heat capacity approaches a constant value at high temperatures. The temperature dependent specific heat capacity variation trend of the AgNW is similar to that of bulk silver (Section S3, ESI†).
 Fig. 3  The temperature dependent specific heat capacity of the AgNW. 
The thermal conductivity of the AgNW is determined by the phonon scattering mechanisms. Due to the effect of electron–phonon scattering on the lattice thermal conductivity, it decreases with the temperature, and the lattice thermal conductivity (kepL) determining the electron–phonon scattering process increases with temperature [Fig. 4(a) (green curve)]. In contrast, the lattice thermal conductivity (kuL) determining the phonon–phonon scattering process decreases with temperature (Section S4, ESI†) because the phonon–phonon scattering rate of the AgNW increases with temperature [Fig. 2]. The temperature dependent variation trend of the lattice thermal conductivity (kep+uL) considering both electron–phonon scattering and phonon–phonon scattering processes is opposite diametrically to that of τep+u−1 [Fig. 4(a) (violet curve)]. The maximum value of kep+uL corresponds to a temperature of about 150 K. The phonon structure scattering in the AgNW is also an factor influencing the lattice thermal conductivity. The temperature dependent lattice thermal conductivity (kbL) considering phonon structure scattering is not constant (Section S5, ESI†), although the phonon structure scattering rate is constant in the temperature range of 10 to 300 K [Fig. 2]. The total lattice thermal conductivity (kL) [Fig. 4(a) (red curve)] is similar to kep+uL. This indicates that the phonon structure scattering does not affect the temperature dependent variation trend of both τ−1 and kL. However, the effect on the values of both τ−1 and kL should not be neglected. The variation trend of the kL of the AgNW with temperature is similar to other reports.34,35

The electronic thermal conductivity (ke) originates from the electron transport in the AgNW, which is determined by the Wiedemann–Franz law (ke = L0T/ρ),36 where L0 is the Lorenz number and ρ is the resistivity of the AgNW (Section S2, ESI†). For the nanowire, the changes in the Lorenz number are very small in the corresponding temperature range, with a value of about 2.4 × 10−8 W Ω K−2.37 Due to the resistances of the AgNW are increased with temperature and can be well fitted with the Bloch–Grüneisen formula (Section S2, ESI†). The resistivity of the AgNW also rises with the increase of temperature. Although the resistivity is inversely proportional to electronic thermal conductivity, the ratio of temperature to the resistivity of the AgNW is proportional to the electronic thermal conductivity, which increases with temperature. Correspondingly, the temperature dependent ke increases with temperature in the range of 10 K to 300 K [Fig. 4(b) (violet curve)]. Due to the larger value of ke than kL, the temperature dependent variation of thermal conductivity (k = ke + kL) is similar to that of ke in the same temperature range [Fig. 4(b) (red curve)]. But the ratio of kL to ke does not monotonically increase with temperature [Fig. 4(c)], which increases with temperatures below about 60 K and decreases with temperature at temperatures higher than about 60 K. kL is much smaller than ke in the mentioned temperature range. Correspondingly, the total thermal conductivity is still lower than that of the bulk, which is beneficial to improving the thermoelectric properties of the AgNW.
Thermoelectric properties
Thermoelectric conversion materials can directly convert heat into electricity due to the Seebeck effect or, conversely, can use electricity for heat (heating/cooling) caused by the Peltier effect.38 Therefore, the materials can be utilized for thermal management as well as energy harvesting. The thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency is mainly dependent upon the materials’ performance which is quantified by the figure of merit (ZT), which helps us determine the conversion “efficiency”.39 The definition of ZT is40 (7)where α is the Seebeck coefficient. For metals or degenerate semiconductors, the Seebeck coefficient is given by41 (8)The temperature dependent Seebeck coefficient of the AgNW increases with temperature, and there is a linear relationship between the Seebeck coefficient of the AgNW and temperature [Fig. 5(a)]. In addition to the AgNW, the temperature dependent Seebeck coefficient of the corresponding bulk also increases with temperature in the temperature range of 100 to 300 K [Fig. 5(a)].42 However, the Seebeck coefficient of the AgNW increases faster than that of the corresponding bulk. This indicates that the AgNW is more efficient for converting heat energy into electrical energy than bulk silver in the corresponding temperature range.
 Fig. 5  (a) The temperature dependent Seebeck coefficient, (b) the power factor, (c) the figure-of-merit, and (d) the compatibility factor of the AgNW and bulk silver (the red and violet curves show the corresponding temperature dependent properties of the AgNW and bulk silver, respectively). 
In order to investigate the effect of the electrical performance on ZT, the power factor (PF = α2/ρ)7 of the AgNW is calculated. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the temperature dependent PF of the AgNW increases with temperature. A similar trend of the PF to that of temperature is reported in other studies.43,44 The PF of the AgNW is lower than that of bulk silver when the temperature is lower than 150 K, and it becomes greater than that of bulk silver when the temperature is higher than 150 K [Fig. 5(b)].42,45 Obviously, the value of resistivity significantly affects the PF of the AgNW, which is a critical factor for the thermoelectric performance.

ZT is coupled with thermal conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient and PF. The temperature dependent ZT of the AgNW is shown in Fig. 5(c). The ZT value is proportional to the square of the Seebeck coefficient and is inversely proportional to the product of the resistivity and the thermal conductivity. The Seebeck coefficient of the AgNW is greater than that of the bulk. Although the resistivity of the AgNW is inversely proportional to the thermal conductivity, the thermal conductivity is related to the specific heat capacity, and the specific heat capacity of the AgNW is much lower than that of the bulk when the temperature is higher than about 30 K (Fig. S3, ESI†). Hence, the product of the resistivity and the thermal conductivity of the AgNW is still lower than that of the bulk. Correspondingly, the ZT value of the AgNW is greater than that of the bulk in the relative temperature range, and the ZT value of the AgNW is about 13 times greater than that of bulk silver at room temperature. As reported in other studies,43,46 the temperature dependent ZT of the AgNW increases monotonously with temperature. Besides, the ZT value of the AgNW is greater than that of bulk silver in the corresponding temperature range,42,45,47 and the difference increases with temperature [Fig. 5(c)]. However, the ZT of the AgNW is much lower than that of some semiconductor materials,43 which is greatly improved compared with bulk silver.
Generally, a AgNW is used as an integral part of a thermoelectric device, and the compatibility between the AgNW and other materials is very important for the performance of thermoelectric devices. The thermoelectric compatibility factor (S) of the material reflects the ratio of the electric current density to the heat flux by thermal conduction, which is defined by the macroscopic property parameters (S = ((1 − ZT)1/2 − 1)/(αT)).48 As shown in Fig. 5(d), the thermoelectric compatibility factor of the AgNW is much greater than that of bulk silver. Comparing with bulk silver, the changes in the compatibility factor of the AgNW with temperature are very small, although the compatibility factor of the AgNW is not constant (Section S6, ESI†). Accordingly, the AgNW is very suitable to be used as a segmented thermoelectric element with other thermoelectric materials in a thermoelectric device at different temperatures.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the electron–phonon scattering rate decreases with temperature in the range of 10 to 300 K. The phonon–phonon Umklapp scattering rate increases with temperature, which becomes greater than the electron–phonon scattering rate when the temperature is higher than the Debye temperature (223 K). The phonon structure scattering rate is constant. The total phonon scattering rate decreases with temperature when it is lower than about 150 K, and increases when it is higher than 150 K. Correspondingly, the temperature dependent variation trend of the lattice thermal conductivity is opposite diametrically to that of the total phonon scattering rate. The temperature dependent ke increases with temperature, but the ratio of kL to ke does not monotonically increase. The ZT value of the AgNW is greater than that of bulk silver in the corresponding temperature range, and this difference increases as the temperature rises. The order of the AgNW ZT is about 13 times greater than that of bulk silver at room temperature. Obviously, the electron scattering and phonon scattering in the AgNW are important factors to improve its thermoelectric properties.
