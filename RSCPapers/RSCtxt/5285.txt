    , Accepted 12th May 2011First published on 3rd June 2011AbstractQuantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) are interesting energy devices because of their (i) impressive ability to harvest sunlight and generate multiple electron/hole pairs, (ii) ease of fabrication, and (iii) low cost. The power conversion efficiencies (η) of most QDSSCs (typically <4%) are, however, less than those (up to 12%) of dye-sensitized solar cells, mainly because of narrow absorption ranges and charge recombination occurring at the QD–electrolyte and TiO2–electrolyte interfaces. To further increase the values of η of QDSSCs, it will be necessary to develop new types of working electrodes, sensitizers, counter electrodes and electrolytes. This Feature Article describes the nanomaterials that have been used recently as electronic conductors, sensitizers and counter electrodes in QDSSCs. The nature, size, morphology and quantity of these nanomaterials all play important roles affecting the efficiencies of electron injection and light harvesting. We discuss the behavior of several important types of semiconductor nanomaterials (sensitizers, including CdS, Ag2S, CdSe, CdTe, CdHgTe, InAs and PbS) and nanomaterials (notably TiO2, ZnO and carbon-based species) that have been developed to improve the electron transport efficiency of QDSSCs. We point out the preparation of new generations of nanomaterials for QDSSCs and the types of electrolytes, particularly iodide/triiodide electrolytes (I−/I3−), polysulfide electrolytes (S2−/Sx2−), and cobalt redox couples ([Co(o-phen)32+/3+]), that improve their lifetimes. With advances in nanotechnology, we foresee significant improvements in the efficiency (η > 6%) and durability (>3000 h) of QDSSCs.

1. Introduction
Recent advances in nanotechnology have opened up new avenues for harvesting light energy—from the visible to the infrared (IR) region of the solar spectrum—using semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with tunable band edges.1–4 QDs offer the advantageous features of photostability, high molar extinction coefficients, size-dependent optical properties and low costs. Thus, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have become one of the most popular subjects for research into the next generation of solar cells.1–4 A phenomenon of multiple-exciton generation is a potential advantage of QDSSCs.1,2,5,6 This unique effect, known as the inverse Auger effect,2 theoretically leads to the production of power conversion efficiencies (η) in QDSSCs than are much higher than those possible with dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).7–9 Theoretically, the maximum thermodynamic conversion efficiency of a QDSSC can reach 44%.2 Although QDSSCs have been studied for many years, at present most of them provide values of η that are below 4.0%,10–16 mainly because serious electron loss occurs through charge recombination at the electrolyte–electrode interfaces17–19 and because inner energy loss occurs at the electrolyte–counter electrode interfaces.20–22
Strategies for increasing the values of η have focused on using nanomaterials to improve the electron transport rate,23–25 light harvesting ability,26–29 and catalytic ability20–22 and to decrease the degree of charge recombination.17–19 Relative to TiO2 spherical nanoparticles (NPs), TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) improve the rate of electron transport between the electrode and the QDs, thereby increasing the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE; 45 vs. 35%) in CdSe QDSSCs.24 A coating of ZnS on the surface of the photoelectrode (QDs/TiO2 film) used as a protective layer can efficiently suppress charge recombination at the QD–electrolyte interface.19 A co-sensitized QDSSC incorporating two differently sized CdSe QDs provided a broad absorption coverage of the solar spectrum.28 QDSSCs prepared from three differently sized CdTe QDs on TiO2 NPs exhibited increased light harvesting efficiency (LHE) and electron injection efficiency.29 QDSSCs fabricated from multilayered CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDs on TiO2 electrodes through chemical deposition have provided a noteworthy value of η of 4.22%.26 On the other hand, to maximize the durability of QDSSCs, polysulfide (S2−/Sx2−)30,31 and cobalt complex (Co2+/Co3+)32–34 redox couples have been tested as active electrolytes to replace the iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) electrolytes that usually cause photocorrosion.30,31 Notably, however, rather low fill factors (FFs) were obtained when Pt electrodes were used with the first two electrolytes. To overcome this problem, much effort has been exerted in a search for ideal and identifiable nanomaterial-based counter electrodes for QDSSCs incorporating polysulfide or cobalt complex redox couples.30–34 Using counter electrodes featuring nanomaterials with high conductivity, high electrocatalytic activity and low charge transfer resistance (Rct) is one potential solution to the problems associated with energy loss in QDSSCs.20–22 For example, ordered multimodal porous carbon nanomaterials having a low value of Rct (3.5 Ω cm2) have been used in CdSe QDSSCs to provide a high FF (56%) and, therefore, a high value of η (4.36%).22
Our aim for this Feature Article is to highlight recent advances in QDSSCs featuring nanomaterials. We emphasized the roles that nanomaterials play in determining the performance of QDSSCs, measured in terms of to the value of Rct, IPCE, short circuit current density (JSC) and η. After a brief discussion of the basic principles behind QDSSCs, particular focus is placed on the nanomaterials that have been used as electron conductors, sensitizers and counter electrodes within them. We also highlight the effect of the electrolytes on such QDSSCs. After discussing the (potential) advantages and disadvantages of QDSSCs featuring nanomaterials, we conclude this review by suggesting the future trends in the development of QDSSCs.
2. Basic principles of QDSSCs
The photoelectrodes in QDSSCs are typically fabricated through adsorption or deposition of QDs onto wide-bandgap semiconductor nanomaterials (e.g., TiO2; typical diameter: 25 nm) that have been sintered35 to form mesoporous films. These films act as electron conductors (or acceptors) and transport layers. Under illumination with sunlight, electron/hole pairs form in the QDs, leading to the injection of electrons from the conduction band (CB), excitonic states, or trap states of the QDs into the CB or other acceptor states of TiO2 (Fig. 1). The original state of the QDs is restored through electron donation from the electrolyte, which is usually a redox system; for example, polysulfide (S2−/Sx2−) redox couples are used widely in QDSSCs. In the electrolytes, the oxidization occurs at the photoelectrode (TiO2/QDs film)–electrolyte interface:26,30 S2− + 2h+ → S(1) S + Sx−12− → Sx2− (x = 2–5)(2)During regeneration in the electrolyte, the oxidized species, Sx2−, is converted back (reduced) to S2− on the counter electrode:30,31 Sx2− + 2e− → Sx−12− + S2−(3)The circuit is completed via electron migration through the external load. The generated voltage corresponds to the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the electron in the photoelectrode and the redox potential of the electrolyte. As a result, QDSSC devices generate electrical power when irradiated with sunlight. The value of η of any QDSSC can be calculated from the value of JSC, the open-circuit voltage (VOC), the FF, and the intensity of the incident light (P), according to the equation8,9 η = (JSC × VOC × FF)/P(4)The values of JSC, VOC and FF can be calculated from the direct current density–voltage (J–V) curves (Fig. 2A); JSC is the maximum current density when the voltage is zero; VOC is the maximum voltage when the current density is zero. The FF is defined as the ratio of the actual maximum obtainable power (Pactual) to the theoretical power (Ptheoretical), which can be obtained from the ratio of (Vmp × Jmp) to (VOC × JSC), where Jmp and Vmp represent the current density and voltage at the actual maximum obtainable power (Fig. 2B). Eqn (4) is for two-electrode measurement, but not suitable for three-electrode measurements, mainly because the reference potential is not responsible for the respective dark potential.4

To determine the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected at the electrodes to the number of incident photons, the IPCE (also known as the external quantum efficiency) is measured.7 The IPCEs at different wavelengths can be estimated from the short circuit photocurrents (ISC) monitored at different excitation wavelengths (λ), using the expression7 IPCE(%) = [1240 × ISC(A cm−2)]/[λ(nm)] × Iinc(W cm−2)] × 100%(5)where Iinc is the incident light power. IPCE spectra have been used to confirm the values of JSC obtained directly from J–V measurements.4,36–38 Values of JSC can be estimated by integrating the product of the incident photon flux density [F(λ)] and IPCE(λ) of the solar cell over the range of wavelengths (λ) of the incident light:36,37 JSC = ∫qF(λ)IPCE(λ)dλ(6)where q is the electron charge. For an ideal solar cell, the value of JSC calculated from an IPCE spectrum would be identical to that obtained directly from the J–V measurements.4
3. Roles played by nanomaterials in QDSSCs
The nanomaterials used commonly in QDSSCs include Ag2S,39 CdS,40–42 PbS,43–45 PbS/CdS,46 ZnSe,47 CdSe,48–50 CdTe,29,49 CdHgTe,51 InP,52 and InAs.53 The advantageous features of QDs include (i) multiple-exciton effects, potentially leading to high theoretical quantum efficiencies;1,2,5,6 (ii) effective charge transfer to the conduction band of TiO2 upon visible light irradiation;23,24 (iii) size-dependent band gaps, due to quantum confinement effects, result in effective absorption of solar energy when using mixed QDs of various sizes. In addition, the tunable position of the band edges of QDs can provide possible charge separation;20,26,54 and (iv) photochemical stability. Among the tested QDs, CdSe48–50 and CdTe29,49 are used most commonly in QDSSCs, mainly because they are easy to prepare and characterize and because of their strong LHE in the UV-Vis region.
3.1. Multiple exciton generation
Reducing the energy loss caused by the thermal relaxation of photogenerated hot electrons and holes is an essential aspect of achieving QDSSCs with efficient conversion efficiency. One promising approach is the generation of hot carriers before the electron relaxes to the band edge via photon emission.1,55–58 A fundamental use of hot carriers is to produce enhanced photocurrents; this approach requires the energetic hot carriers to produce a second (or more) electron/hole pair through impact ionization—a process that is the inverse of an Auger process, whereby two electron/hole pairs recombine to produce a single highly energetic electron/hole pair (Fig. 3).1,55–58 Thus, it is essential that the impact ionization process is faster than the carrier cooling or other relaxation processes of the hot carriers. It has been verified that the relaxation dynamics of photogenerated carriers are affected significantly by quantization effects in nanostructures.1 Because a hot electron usually transfers its excess kinetic energy to a thermalized hole via an Auger process, the hole cools rapidly. To slow down the rate of electron cooling, the hole is usually removed from the QDs' core by a fast hole trap at the surface, thereby blocking the Auger process.59,60 Highly efficient multiple-exciton generation has been demonstrated in PbS and PbSe QDs.56 Unlike dye molecules, efficient inverse Auger effects in QDSSCs can produce much higher conversion efficiencies than those in DSSCs. As a result, the predicted maximum efficiencies of QDSSCs are higher than those of DSSCs; theoretically, they can reach as high as 44%.2

The elaborate analysis of transient photoluminescence measurements reveal that the multiple-exciton generation is negligible or not detectable in CdSe, CdTe and InAs QDs,61,62 which is conflicting with earlier reports.63–65 On the other hand, the femtosecond transient photobleaching measurements from spectral integration provide strong evidences of the occurence of multiple-exciton generation in PbSe QDs.66,67 We point out that quantitative analysis of the multiple-exciton generation efficiency should be obtained from spectral integration, not from a transient signal measured at a single wavelength, mainly because of the excitation-induced shifts in the absorption spectrum. It has been further suggested that fast extraction of multiple excitons by strong electronic coupling and favorable energy level alignment between PbS QDs and TiO2 is responsible for the multiple-exciton generation occurred in PbS QDs.68
3.2. Charge separation and transport
After excitation, QDs undergo charge separation reactions to generate electron-hole pairs, as follows:23,24 QD + hν → QD(ep + hp) → QD(es + hs)(7) QD(es + hs) → QD + hν(8)Here, the subscripts s and p represent the lower and higher electronic states of the electron (e) and hole (h). (After excitation, charge will relax from a higher energy electronic state of p into a lower state of s within <1 ps).25 Charge transfer occurs at the interface between the TiO2 and the excited QDs, as in the following reaction:23,24 QD(es) + TiO2 → QD(hp) + TiO2(e)(9) QD(hp) + Red → QD + Ox(10)where, Red and Ox are the reduction and oxidized states of electrolyte. The rate of electron injection (ket) from the excited QDs into the TiO2 is calculated using the equation23,24 ket = 1/τ(QD+TiO2) − 1/τQD(11)where τ(QD+TiO2) and τQD are the bleaching recovery lifetimes in the presence and absence of TiO2, respectively. A size-dependent rate of electron transfer has been observed in a QD-TiO2 system, based on the quantum size effect; here, the electron transfer rate constants decreased upon increasing the size of the QDs (e.g., for 2.6- and 3.7-nm-diameter CdSe QDs on sphere-like TiO2 films, they were 2.5 × 109 and 0.63 × 109 s−1, respectively).24 In addition, electron transfer rate constants for 3.7-nm CdSe QDs on TiO2 NPs and NTs were similar (0.63 × 109vs. 0.55 × 109 s−1).24 These results reveal that the charge injection dynamics were determined mostly by the QDs, not by the morphology of the acceptor TiO2. Kamat et al. demonstrated that varying the solution pH could modulate the charge injection process. Although the band energy of the QDs remains constant, the CB of TiO2 shifts to more negative potentials upon increasing the pH, decreasing the difference in the band energy between CdSe and TiO2.69 Upon increasing the pH from 5.5 to 12.0, the energy difference in the CdSe-TiO2 system decreased from ca. 1.0 eV to ca. 0.61 eV, thereby decreasing the electron injection rate constant (2 × 108vs. 3 × 107 s−1).69
The energy from QDs' photogenerated excitons can be used efficiently if their electron/hole pairs are separated quickly and the generated electrons are transported to the electrode surface effectively.70,71 Several nanomaterials, including TiO2 NTs, C60,70 and stacked-cup carbon NTs,71 have been employed to improve the capture of electrons; for example, the electron collection efficiency in TiO2 NTs relative to TiO2 NPs is more efficient. Table 1 lists the electron transfer rate constants from CdSe QDs into various electron conductors. The rate of electron transfer can be controlled effectively by changing the nature of the electron conductor. For example, the rate constants for electron transfer from CdSe QDs to C60 and stacked-cup carbon NTs are 2.93 × 109 and 7.04 × 1010 s−1, respectively.71

The effect of either the nature of the linker or the number of successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) deposition cycles on the electron injection rate have been reported.72 Upon increasing the SILAR deposition cycles from 2 to 15, electron injection times increases from 2.8 to 6.3 ps, while the electron relaxation time increases from 83 to 320 ps. The results reveal that upon increasing the number of deposition cycles the rate of electron injection from QDs to TiO2 significantly decreases and the TiO2 surface tends to be saturated with QDs. The nature of organic linkers plays a role in affecting the electron transfer rate.73 The electron rate constant follows the order of p-mercaptobenzoic acid < mercaptopropionic acid < cysteine.
Kang et al. observed that CdS/CdSe QDSSCs featuring TiO2 nanofibers (NFs) feature reduced grain boundaries (increased VOC), leading to enhanced electron transport efficiency.74 These reports highlight the notion that strategies for increasing electron transport between the electron conductor and QDs are highly desired for developing next-generation QDSSCs.
Electron transport through nanocrystalline TiO2 films involves trap-state-mediated diffusive hopping of electrons. Generally, slow electron transport results in increased rates of charge recombination between the photoelectrode and the electrolyte.75–78 Because charge recombination and electron diffusion occur at the photoelectrode–redox electrolyte interface,17 the injected CB electrons may recombine with oxidized QDs or react with redox species in the electrolyte. One method for preventing electron leakage from the QDs into the electrolyte in QDSSCs is coating the QDs with a protective layer of nanomaterials having a higher bandgap than that of the QDs themselves. A ZnS coating is commonly used for CdS and CdSe QDs, because its CB edge potential is more negative than those of the CdS and CdSe QDs and it is easier to form a thin layer on those QDs.19 The values of KSP for CdS, CdSe and ZnS are 10−28, 4 × 10−35 and 10−27, respectively.79 The ZnS covering passivates the surface states of the QDs, thereby suppressing the surface trapping of photoexcited electrons and holes in the QDs. As a result, the photoexcited electrons are transferred into the TiO2 CB efficiently, providing higher values of JSC and IPCE (Fig. 4). In addition, the ZnS coating improves the chemical stability of the QDSSCSs.19
 Fig. 4  IPCE spectra of CdSe QDSSCs with and without a ZnS coating. 
Providing that the number of injected electrons is equal to the number of electrons collected on the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate, any electron loss is due solely to charge recombination; because the rate constants for these processes would be independent of each other, the electron collection efficiency (ηc) from the electron conductor into the TCO substrate can be calculated using an approximate eqn (12):80–83 ηc = JSC/Jinj = JSC/[JSC + Jr] = 1 − [τSC/τOC](12)where JSC, Jinj and Jr are the short circuit current density, the electron injection current density from excited QDs to the anode, and the recombination current density, respectively, and τSC and τOC are the electron transit and recombination times, respectively. Thus, the value of ηc under certain conditions is readily calculated from the values of τSC and τOC measured from using intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy, respectively. Alternatively, ηc can be calculated from the IPCE of a solar cell using eqn (13):81 IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ) × Φinj × ηc(13)Where LHE(λ) is the LHE at a certain wavelength and Φinj is the electron injection efficiency.
The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) is an important characteristic of a solar cell;7,84 it reveals how efficiently the absorbed photons are converted to current in the external circuit. For an ideal solar cell, the IQE would be 1. The IQE of a solar cell at a certain wavelength can be calculated from the IPCE and LHE, after accounting for the loss due to light absorption (%TTCO) by the TCO substrate, according to eqn (14):84 IQE = IPCE/[%TTCO × LHE] = Φinj × ηc(14)where ηc is the charge collection efficiency, accounting for the electron transport in the TiO2 film and the redox couple–mediated hole transport between the sensitizer and the counter electrode. Alternatively, LHE can be calculated according to eqn (15):68 LHE(%) = 1 − 10−Absorbance(15)where absorbance is that light actually absorbed by the QDs. An IQE of almost 1 indicates that the values of both Φinj and ηc are close to 100%, a feature of QDSSCs.84–86
3.3. Light harvesting
The major advantage of using QDs as sensitizers in QDSSCs is the size-dependence of their optical properties.87 Varying the size of QDs allows control over the harvesting of light energy in the solar spectrum. Semiconductor QDs, such as CdS40–42 and CdSe,48–50 with tunable bandgaps have been reported for the harvesting of visible solar light. Table 2 lists the light harvesting regions of several QDs. Table 2 summarizes the investigated IPCE values of some recent reported QDSSCs over different wavelength regions. In the corresponding wavelength region, each of the QDSSCs has its unique IPCE characteristics. The data reveal that the wavelengths depend on the sizes and compositions of the QDs. For example, 2.3-, 2.6- and 3.0-nm CdSe QDs provided IPCE values over the wavelength regions of 350–550, 350–570 and 350–600 nm, respectively. CdTe and CdSe QDSSCs, both with the diameter of 3.0 nm, exhibit IPCE values in different wavelength regions (400–700 nm vs. 350–600 nm). CdS and CdSe QDs absorb light at the wavelengths of less than 700 nm, limiting their capability to harvest light in the near-infrared (NIR) region. As a result, CdS and CdSe QDSSCs do not provide high values of JSC; indeed, they are usually less than 20.4 mA cm−2 (Table 3).88 Providing that the IPCE is 100% and no energy loss occurs, QDSSCs provide higher values of JSC when the QDs absorb light from the UV to NIR region. For example, QDs absorbing light in the wavelength regions from 280 to 800 nm, from 280 to 1100 nm, and from 280 to 1500 nm could provide values of JSC of up to 27.2, 43.4 and 52.8 mA cm−2, respectively.88 Because Ag2S39 and InAs53 QDs absorb light over the wavelength range 400–1100 nm, they could, theoretically, provide higher values of JSC than could CdS and CdSe QDs. Unfortunately, their IPCEs (<10%) are much lower than those (60%) provided by CdS and CdSe QDs, mainly because of low coverage on TiO2 surfaces.89 Thus, strategies for enhancing the adsorption of Ag2S and InAs QDs on TiO2 surfaces are desired.

Co-sensitization using at least two different sizes or types of QDs has been employed to improve the LHE through absorption of light over a broader region.20,26 When CdSe QDs of two different sizes (2.6 and 3.0 nm) were used to fabricate QDSSCs, the value of η (1.2%) was larger than those (0.91 and 0.86%) of the QDSSCs fabricated from the individual CdSe QDs.28 Chang et al. fabricated CdTe/CdHgTe and CdHgTe/CdTe QDSSCs that provided values of η of 1.0 and 2.2%, respectively.51 Because the bandgaps of CdHgTe and CdTe are 2.3 and 0.95 eV, respectively, and the CB edge potential of CdTe is more negative than that of CdHgTe, electron injection does not occur from the CdHgTe QDs into CdTe QDs, leading to a low value of JSC (3.11 vs. 4.43 mA cm−2).51 We point out that CdHgTe QDs are not suitable for the fabrication of QDSSCs, simply because toxic metal ions (Cd2+ and Hg2+ ions) are used as precursors.
An energy band offset usually exists at a semiconductor interface, leading to inhibition or promotion of electron transfer from one semiconductor to another.26,51 Lee et al. developed a cascade structure of CdS/CdSe QDs for use as co-sensitizers to improve the efficiency (η = 4.22%) of QDSSCs.26Fig. 5 reveals that CdZnS/CdZnSe QDSSCs provide an IPCE (75%) that is higher than that of CdZnS QDSSCs (55%), mainly due to their broader light harvesting region.90

The light trapping effect can be used to further increase the LHE of QDSSCs. It can be achieved simply by the presence of a light-scattering layer in DSSCs; for example, by adding submicron particles to TiO2 electrodes.91–94 The value of JSC increases from 4.27 to 9.07 mA cm−2 in the presence of the scattering layer; as a result, η increases from 2.42 to 5.12%.91
3.4. Photochemical stability
It is crucial that sunlight does not induce photocorrosion of the QDs.30,31 Photocorrosion not only deteriorates the values of η of QDSSCs but also shortens their lifetime. The most commonly employed electrolytes in QDSSCs are iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−), polysulfide (S2−/Sx2−),30,31 and cobalt complex (Co2+/Co3+)32–34 redox couples. The I−/I3− redox couple [redox potential, Ered: +0.45 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)] has the ideal kinetic properties for regeneration of the oxidized dye and for inhibition of the recombination of excited electrons to electrolyte in DSSCs;7–9 unfortunately, it is corrosive to QDSSCs, leading to rapid decreases in values of JSC.30,31 Tachibana et al. compared the photocurrent transients in CdS QDSSCs with I−/I3− and Na2Sx/Na2S electrolytes under continuous light irradiation at 450 nm (6.47 mW cm−2).31 Relative to the Na2Sx/Na2S electrolyte, the I−/I3− electrolyte generated lower values of JSC (0.8 vs. <0.2 mA cm−2) with poorer durability (several hours vs. 100 s) when employed in CdS QDSSCs. Polysulfide solutions (Ered = ca. −0.45 V vs. NHE) have been used to stabilize QDSSCs against photocorrosion, thereby generating more-stable photocurrents and extending the durability of QDSSCs.30,31 For QDSSCs featuring cadmium chalcogenides (S, Se, Te) as sensitizers, the S2−/Sx2− electrolyte is ideal. Lee et al. reported that CdS QDSSCs incorporating the S2−/Sx2− electrolyte had a higher IPCE than did those incorporating the I−/I3− electrolyte (80% vs. <70%), mainly due to the stability of the CdS QDs in the former electrolyte.30 Although the S2−/Sx2− electrolyte has impressive advantages (high values of JSC; durability of QDSSCs), there are some problems that must be overcome. In particular, the values of VOC in most cadmium chalcogenide QDSSCs featuring the S2−/Sx2− electrolyte are lower than 0.7 V.20–22,26–31 In addition, very low FFs (<50%) are usually obtained in QDSSCs, because the current counter electrode (Pt) is not a highly active electrocatalyst for the oxidization/reduction reactions of the S2−/Sx2− electrolyte. Grätzel and Nazeeruddin et al. used [cobalt(o-phen)3]2+/3+ electrolyte as a promising hole carrier for liquid-type QDSSCs (e.g., those incorporating PbS, CdS and CdSe).32–34 The cobalt complex redox couple provided an overall efficiency of greater than 1% at full intensity, as well as ensuing reasonable stability of the CdSe QDSSCs.32–34 More interestingly, CdSe QDSSCs incorporating the cobalt complex redox couple were durable for greater than 42 days under normal light illumination; the value of JSC decreased slowly to 81% of its initial value after 6 weeks. Nevertheless, well-defined cobalt complex redox couples are not yet commercially available and their syntheses are complicated, limiting their practicality in QDSSCs.
4. Conclusions and perspectives
This Feature Article provides a review of the nanomaterials that have been used in the fabrication of QDSSCs. With advances in nanotechnology, the performances of QDSSCs have improved significantly (Table 4). QDSSCs providing values of η greater than 4% have been prepared;22,23,95 these high values are due mainly to increased electron transport23,24,96,97 and light harvesting33,50,98,99 and decreased inner energy loss.20–22,100 Methanol in the electrolyte can provide higher JSC values, because it acts as a hole scavenger. As a result, the methanol oxidization at the photoelectrode is nonregenative.101 Although QDSSCs are less expensive relative to DSSCs, their efficiencies are also lower. In addition, commercialized QDSSCs and DSSCs are unlikely to appear in the near future.

Although many high-quality QDs have been prepared and used in QDSSCs, most of them do not provide high values of JSC relative to those of DSSCs.20–22 QDs that absorb more strongly over a wider region of the solar spectrum must be prepared. For example, CdHgTe nanomaterials that absorb light from the UV to NIR region might be useful in QDSSCs.51 The use of several types of QDs to increase the absorption region is an approach worth being tested;31 for example, different sizes of spherical and 1-D, 2D and 3-D CdSe QDs102–104 might lead to enhanced values of JSC. With such mixtures, the degree of light trapping within the photoelectrodes can be increased.91–94 It is also possible to use QDs in conjunction with organic dyes to enhance light harvesting via Förster resonance energy transfer.105,106 Direct growth of CdSe QDs, from 4.2-nm CdSe QDs as seeds, onto TiO2 films allows the fabrication of QDSSCs providing values of η of up to 3.21%; this finding reveals that it is important to decrease the degree of charge recombination at the TiO2–QDs interface.107 Direct growth of QDs of various shapes and sizes onto solid substrates might be a useful approach toward improving the values of η of QDSSCs.
Low-cost CoS electrodes have been used to replace Pt electrodes in the fabrication of highly efficient (η = 3.4%) QDSSCs, revealing the importance of searching for novel (nano)materials as counter electrodes (Fig. 6).20 In addition, hierarchical nanostructured spherical carbon with hollow cores/mesoporous shells and ordered multimodal carbon have been used as counter electrodes to fabricate highly efficient QDSSCs.21,22 Although many new nanomaterials have been employed as counter electrodes in QDSSCs to reduce inner energy loss at the electrolyte–counter electrode interface, leading to increased FFs (nearly 50%), these values have remained lower than those obtained in DSSCs (>70%).20–22 Although the I−/I3− electrolyte usually provides greater FFs than those of the S2−/Sx2− electrolyte, photocorrosion associated with the former is problematic.29 Thus, the development of nanomaterials for use as counter electrodes and noncorrosive electrolytes (e.g., solid electrolytes) in QDSSCs is highly desired. For example, CuI108 and ionic liquids109–112 have been employed as solid electrolytes in DSSCs; they should also be tested in QDSSCs. Very recently, an efficiency over 5% provided by Sb2S3 QDSSCs using solid polymer electrolyte such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) has been reported.113

One-dimensional nanostructures, such as NTs,39,114–116 NRs,41 nanowires (NWs),94,117–119 and NFs,74,99,120 are effective photoelectrodes, mainly because they significantly improve electron transport, thereby decreasing the rate of recombination of electrons with oxidized QDs on the TiO2 surface or with the electrolyte. In addition, these nanostructures provide large surface areas for adsorption of greater amounts of QDs, thereby enhancing the LHE.120 For example, CdSe QDSSCs featuring TiO2 NPs and NTs have exhibited maximum IPCEs of 35 and 45%, respectively.24 Although 1D TiO2-based nanostructures have advantages over the use of spherical TiO2 NPs, there are some problems that limit their popularity: (i) their preparation is not as simple as that of spherical TiO2 NPs; (ii) their quality is not as high as that of spherical TiO2 NPs (the lengths and widths of 1-D nanostructures are not readily controlled); (iii) Organic dyes are not easily adsorbed onto 1-D nanostructures;121,122 (iv) large-scale preparation of 1-D nanostructures is not simple. To overcome the problems, an advanced nanotechnology for the preparation of 1-D TiO2 nanostructures is highly desired. Instead of using 1-D TiO2 nanostructures, other types of 1-D or 0-D nanostructures have been employed, including carbon NTs,44,71,123–125 ZnO NWs,117–119 and SnO2 NPs126). In these cases, however, efficient anchoring of QDs on their surface would be required to provide comparable or better performance than that of 1-D TiO2 nanostructures.
Another important issue in QDSSCs is extending their durability, which is usually low as a result of leaking and photo-corrosion. The longest period of durability of a reported QDSSC has been only 42 days,32–34 an unacceptable length of time from a commercial viewpoint. The most expensive Si-based solar cells can be used for at least 20 years. Therefore, it is extremely important to search for new electrolytes and ionic liquids to increase the durability of QDSSCs.
To prevent use of toxic precursors and organic solvents in the preparation of QDSSCs, low-toxicity precursors and ionic liquid based electrolytes have been used. Low-toxicity QDs such as Ag2S,39 Sb2S3,45,127,128 Bi2S3,45,129 CuInS2,130,131 and SnS2132,133 have been prepared and used to fabricate QDSSCs. Ionic liquid based electrolytes,29,51 such as 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate, have been used in QDSSCs.
Although ideal QDSSCs are not yet available, they have high potential to become new-generation energy devices. The cost of QDSSCs is much lower than that of organic dye- and Si-based solar cells. With advances in nanotechnology, many problems (low LHE, energy loss and loss of electrolyte) that commonly occur in QDSSCs might be partially solved in the near future, based on the fact that nanomaterials have unique optical and electrical properties, greater surface area and chemical and photo stability. For example, very recently, CdS/CdSe QDSSCs with 4.92% efficiency have been prepared, with an advantage of improvement in the electron transfer yield (95.3%).134 The problem in electrolyte loss can be overcome by using solid electrolytes and ionic liquids. For example, poly(3-hexythiophene) as a hole conductor has been demonstrated in highly efficient Sb2S3 QDSSCs.113
