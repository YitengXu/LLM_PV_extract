, Accepted 24th March 2013First published on 25th March 2013AbstractThe aqueous photocathode activity of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene), a p-type organic semiconductor, is presented. Photocurrents up to 20 μA cm−2 under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5D irradiation were observed. The highest photon-to-current conversion efficiency was produced for the thinnest films studied (40 nm), attaining a value of 0.55%, which is 10 times greater than reported for regiorandom P3HT. Increasing the thickness of the polymer increased the photocurrent but decreased the photoconversion efficiency. UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy indicates protonation is restricted to the surface of the films in aqueous acid. A mechanism for the photocathode activity involving reduction of surface-protonated P3HT is proposed.
Introduction
Approximately 14 TW of solar energy strikes the earth every hour, equal to the current global annual usage.1 It is not surprising therefore that strategies to capture as much of this energy as reasonably possible, and as inexpensively as possible, are gaining increasing momentum. In the solar energy sector, the photovoltaic (PV) industry is regarded as undergoing the fastest growth.2 The PV industry is currently dominated by inorganic-based semiconductor materials. However, organic semiconductors are being intensely investigated because they offer potential attributes of low cost and low mass, and are easy to process as ultrathin films, compared to inorganic-based counterparts.3–5 Another application area of interest for photoactive semiconductors is their employment as photoelectrodes in photoelectrochemical systems, which use solar radiation to drive specific chemical reactions to produce energy carriers, products, or destroy unwanted reagents.6–9 As with inorganic semiconductors, organic semiconductor analogues are being investigated for photoactivity in solution to drive desired reactions. Examples include hydrogen production, CO2 reduction, and degradation of organic pollutants.8,10–12 π-Conjugated polymers are prime candidates for photoelectrode activity because they absorb visible light, and generate electrons and holes with significant redox power upon irradiation. π-Conjugated polymers are typically p-type semiconductors, which means that during illumination in an electrochemical cell, electrons flow towards the semiconductor–electrolyte interface and result in electrochemical reduction reactions.
A ubiquitous example of a π-conjugated polymer is poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT).13 In PV devices, P3HT has provided power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 6.5% in conjunction with an electron acceptor.14 The first report of P3HT being used as a photocathode in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell was reported by El-Rashiedy and Holdcroft.15 It was discovered that application of a potential bias more negative than the Fermi energy [+0.3 V (vs. SCE)], in aqueous solution, resulted in a depletion layer at the polymer–solution interface, and that upon photoexcitation a photocathodic current was produced. Photovoltages generated were linearly related to the pH of the solution, concomitant with the variation in redox potential of the H+/H2 couple. Photocurrent and quantum efficiency, while dependent on the solution pH, irradiation intensity, excitation wavelength, and film thickness were, however, low. More recently, Yang et al. constructed PEC cells based on Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of P3HT.16,17 Sub-μA cm−2 photocurrents were reported that increase by at least an order of magnitude upon incorporation of mono-metallofullerenes. Cathodic photocurrents were further increased by the introduction of oxygen or other electron acceptors into solution. Mechanisms for cathodic photocurrent generation, in the presence of methyl viologen, were proposed for films composed of P3HT and fullerene (C60) or metallofullerene (Dy@C82) and showed that PEC is useful way to gain insight into solar cell performance and design. More recently still, Abe et al. reported photoanode activity of a composite, P3HT/PCBM, in aqueous solution which was further enhanced in combination with a p-type zinc phthalocyanine surface modification.18 Based on transmission electron microscopy and PEC measurements, the authors determined that photogenerated holes accumulate at the solid–solution interface due to maldistribution of P3HT towards the surface of the film.
Our early work investigating P3HT as a photocathode in aqueous solution employed regiorandom (RRa) P3HT, prepared by oxidative polymerization using ferric chloride, possessing <70% head-to-tail couplings.15 It is widely known that increasing the regioregularity of P3HT modifies the polymer's optical properties and greatly enhances charge carrier mobility,19 which may partly explain the low photocurrents and photo-efficiencies originally observed. In this report we demonstrate significantly enhanced photocurrents of regioregular (RR) P3HT in aqueous solutions when used in a photoelectrochemical cell according to the scheme shown in Fig. 1. We examine the electrochemistry of P3HT films in aqueous and non-aqueous solution in order to gain insight into the mechanism of photocathodic activity.

Experimental
Materials were used as received without any further purification. The monomer 3-hexylthiophene was purchased from Rieke Metals. Dodecylmagnesium bromide (1.0 M in ether), N-bromosuccinimide, and Ni(dppe)Cl2 were purchased from Aldrich. Regioregular P3HT was prepared according to the GRIM method.20,21 Preparation of the 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene was carried out following a literature procedure.20
(RR) P3HT
To 80 mL of dry THF, 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene (7.86 g, 24.11 mmol) and dodecylmagnesium bromide (1.0 M in ether, 24 mL) were added under argon. The solution was stirred at reflux for 1 hour. The catalyst, Ni(dppe)Cl2 (64 mg, 0.12 mmol), was added and the solution was stirred for 45 minutes at reflux. After cooling to room temperature, the polymer was precipitated into 1 L of methanol. The solid was purified by Soxhlet extraction using successively methanol, hexane, and chloroform. The polymer dissolved in the chloroform fraction and was collected by rotary evaporation of the solvent. Molecular weight of the polymer was determined by gel permeation chromatography, GPC, (Mn = 31.7 kDa, PDI = 1.2). The degree of regioregularity was determined from 1H NMR and found to ≥98% HT coupling. Yield: 62%.
Solutions of RR-P3HT in dichlorobenzene (10, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 mg mL−1) were stirred and heated overnight at 60 °C and spin cast at room temperature onto indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated glass (4.2 ohms/sq) in a glove box at 1000 rpm for 60 s to prepare films of variable thickness. The films were solvent annealed under a Petri dish for 30 min followed by thermal annealing inside a glove box (H2O and O2 < 0.1 ppm) at 150 °C for 30 min. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 300 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a Photon Technology International PTI Felix32 system. Film thicknesses were determined using an Alpha-Step IQ profilometer (KLA-Tencor). A Xe/Hg 200 W lamp was used as the light source in combination with an AM 1.5D filter (Photon Technology International LPS-250B.) and neutral density filters to achieve 100 mW cm−2. The incident light power was measured using a broadband power meter 841-PE (Newport) equipped with an Ophir thermal detector head (3A-P-SH-V1). The cell configuration was designed to irradiate the polymer–electrolyte interface through the electrolyte. A water filter was placed in front of the electrochemical cell to remove excess heat. Electrochemical measurements were performed using a Pine Bipotentiostat (AFC-BP1) and the data processed using Aftermath Scientific Data Organization Software (ASTP-B01 Module). Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a 3-electrode cell using an Ag/AgCl (sat.) reference electrode and a platinum foil counter electrode in 0.1 M H2SO4 (unless otherwise stated).
Discussion and results
Films of RR-P3HT possess a broad absorption between 350 and 650 nm and an absorption maximum at ∼550 nm. A UV-vis spectrum is shown in inset of Fig. 2. From the onset of the absorption (665 nm), the optical band gap (Eg) is estimated to 1.8 eV. RR-P3HT was deposited on a glassy carbon electrode and voltammetry was performed with a Pt counter electrode and a silver wire reference in 0.1 M TBAP–acetonitrile. As shown in Fig. 2, the onset potential corresponding to the reduction and oxidation of RR-P3HT is −2.23 V and −0.01 V, respectively, vs. Fc+/Fc, from which the energy levels of the valence band (EVB) and conduction band (ECB) are estimated to be −5.3 eV and −3.1 eV, respectively.22 For any redox couple lower than ECB, electrons promoted to the CB of RR-P3HT have sufficient energy to drive the reaction Ox + e− → Red, as illustrated in Fig. 1.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to obtain a Mott–Schottky plot for RR-P3HT films, as shown in Fig. 3. The plot consists of a linear portion with a negative slope, which is characteristic of a p-type semiconductor. Using the Mott–Schottky equation (eqn (1)), the intercept with the x-axis and the slope, the flat band potential (Efb) and the charge carrier density (N) was estimated. The parameters and constants in the Mott–Schottky equation are the dielectric constant, ε (3 in this study);23,24 the permittivity of free space, ε0; the charge of an electron, e; the geometric area of the electrode, A; the Boltzmann constant, kB; and the applied potential, E. For RR-P3HT in 0.1 M H2SO4, Efb is ∼+0.15 V (at 25 °C) (Ag/AgCl, sat.), or −4.7 eV. N was calculated to be 1.0 × 1017 cm−3. This value is in the same order of magnitude reported for other conjugated polymers, including polybithiophene (3.5 × 1017 cm−3), poly(4,4′′-dimethoxy-3′-methyl-2′,5′,2′′-tertiophene) (1.18 × 1016 cm−3), and poly(3,4-dimethoxythiophene)/poly(styrene sulfonate) (2.6 × 1017 cm−3).25–27

A typical photo-assisted current–voltage curve for P3HT-coated ITO in 0.1 M H2SO4 is shown in Fig. 4. A cathodic photocurrent (Iph) is observed under illumination, which increases with increasing applied negative potential. This is characteristic of a p-type semiconductor electrode. A photocurrent density of ∼20 μA cm−2 is measured at −0.4 V (Ag/AgCl, sat.). A plot of photocurrent at −0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, sat.) vs. thickness is plotted in Fig. 5. The thinnest films studied (40 nm) yield a photocurrent of ∼6 μA cm−2, which increases to 10 μA cm−2 at −0.2 V with increasing thickness (250 nm), approaching a limiting value. A plot of transmittance of light vs. distance into the film, shown in Fig. 5, illustrates that light penetration at the polymer–electrolyte interface falls to 10% of its original value over a distance of 130 nm. As the thickness of the film is increased, the number of photoactive units increases, which explains both the increase in photocurrent and decrease in transmittance. The electrical resistance of the film, however, also increases with film thickness, which may be responsible for the limiting value of the photocurrent. Furthermore, as photo-generated excitons in P3HT films possess relatively short diffusion lengths (tens of nm),28,29 excitons generated deeper into a thick film, i.e., more than an exciton diffusion length away from the space charge layer that exists at the P3HT–electrolyte interface, are unlikely to reach that interface. These results are similar to other thickness dependant studies on RRa-P3HT and P3HT–metalofullerene composites.15,16,30

The incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) was calculated from the photocurrent at −0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, sat.) using eqn (2), where jp is the photocurrent (A cm−2), λ is the wavelength of incident light (nm), and I0 is the incident power absorbed (W cm−2). A plot of IPCE vs. film thickness is shown in Fig. 6. An IPCE of 0.55% was observed for the thinnest films studied, but this dropped to 0.2% for film thicknesses >100 nm. The IPCEs are two orders of magnitude lower than observed for solid state, bilayer, organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices (30–40%)31,32 that incorporate an electron blocking layer, but similar to single layer component OPV devices (0.5%).33 The plateau in efficiency for films >100 nm thick is considered to be due to the limited depth of light penetration and the inability of excitons formed deep in the polymer film reaching the polymer–electrolyte interface. The relationship between the IPCE and incident power, recorded at −0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, sat.) and 550 nm, is shown in Fig. 7. Increasing the incident power increases photocurrent but decreases the efficiency. With a higher incident power, a greater number of excitons are generated, thus increasing the photocurrent, but the likelihood of exciton recombination also increases.

The photocurrents produced are stable and no degradation of the material is observed after hours of irradiation. The photocurrent is clearly due to photoelectrolysis of solution species and not, for example, due to a simple irreversible photoelectrochemical reduction of the film. This assertion is supported by firstly considering the charge required to completely and irreversibly reduce the film and secondly by spectroelectrochemistry. We calculate that 168 μC of coulombic charge is needed to completely reduce a 100 nm thick P3HT film on a 1.5 mm radius disk, assuming 1.5 e− per 4 thiophene units for n-doping,34 and a polymer density of 1.10 g cm−3.35 Thinner films would require correspondingly less. However, over a period of two hours photoelectrolysis, >30000 μC of cathodic photocurrent are typically passed, much larger than that possible due to electrochemical reduction or degradation of the film. Moreover, the films are electrochemically silent in the absence of light in aqueous solution, indicating the films do not undergo electrochemical reduction in aqueous solution. In fact, even the characteristic electrochemically induced oxidation and re-reduction cycles of P3HT that are typically observed in non-aqueous electrolytes are completely suppressed in aqueous solution, as illustrated in Fig. 8. In non-aqueous electrolyte, such as acetonitrile, swelling of the polymer allows counter ions to penetrate into the film and thus balance charge formed during oxidation. Oxidation of the polymer occurs at positive potentials and the absorbance in the visible region decreases due to the formation of polaronic/bipolaronic states in the band (Fig. 8A). In contrast, electrochemical activity in aqueous solution (Fig. 8B) is completely suppressed, the polymer resists oxidation, and no change in absorbance is detected. More relevant to this study, P3HT films are electrochemically inactive at negative potentials, as determined by cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemistry (Fig. 8C). The apparent lack of electrochemical activity in aqueous solution is attributed to the hydrophobicity of the P3HT which prevents swelling and access of the electrolyte into the film.

Films were biased at the indicated potentials for 2 min. before recording the spectrum. 
Since oxygen is rigorously excluded from the apparatus, the most reasonable explanation for the origin of a continuous photoelectrolytic current is the reduction of protons and the evolution of hydrogen. Electrons in the conduction band of P3HT have sufficient reductive power to reduce protons.15 However, we have yet to succeed in detecting hydrogen gas as a product because the photocurrents and quantity of gas produced is too small. For example, cumulative charge passed over two hours under illumination of P3HT (−0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl, 100 mW cm−2 irradiation) corresponds to only 3.8 μL of generated hydrogen.
A mechanism for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution at conjugated polymers films has not been addressed in the literature. Nor is it as straightforward, as in the case for metallic and inorganic electrodes surfaces. It is well documented however that polythiophenes are susceptible to protonation. Original work in this area reports that protonation of a thiophene oligomer is observed when strong acid is introduced into a solution of the oligomer,36 as evidenced by a new single peak in the proton NMR spectrum. A red shift in the UV-visible absorption is also reported, similar to that observed for electrochemical and chemical oxidation of conjugated polythiophenes.37,38 Sulfonic acid derivatives of poly-3-alkylthiophenes also exhibit absorption peaks above 800 nm without any direct electrochemical or chemical oxidation.39 These peaks, also, are similar to polaron/bipolaron peaks observed during electrochemical oxidation but are attributed to protonation of the polymer or “self-acid doping”. An attempt to observe protonation of RR-P3HT in contact with different concentrations of acids in aqueous and non-aqueous solutions was carried out using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. Spectra are shown in Fig. 9. As can be observed in Fig. 9A, the absorbance of RR-P3HT films remains unchanged when immersed in solutions of pH 7 to 1.4. We interpret these observations to mean that RR-P3HT is too hydrophobic to allow access of acid into the film, as in the case of electrochemical analysis in aqueous solutions, rather than an inherent tendency of the polymer not to protonate. In fact, the same experiments performed in acetonitrile, in which films swell and allow acid to penetrate, shows a clear reduction of the band associated with the π–π* transition (see Fig. 9B), indicative of protonation.

Notwithstanding the observation that the RR-P3HT appears impenetrable to aqueous acid, the possibility that protonation occurs at the polymer film's surface, at the polymer–electrolyte interface, cannot be disregarded – it is simply not detectable by transmission absorption spectroscopy. However, we note that the fluorescence intensity of films of RR-P3HT decreases substantially upon exposure to aqueous acid solution (Fig. 10). Given that photogenerated excitons are quenched by protonated π-conjugated species, and that excitons can diffuse through the film, this is interpreted as evidence for the existence of protonated species polymer at the polymer–electrolyte interface.

We conjecture a mechanism occurring at the polymer–electrolyte interface for the photocathode activity of RR-P3HT in aqueous solution as illustrated in Fig. 11. This is based on the known self-doping phenomenon of poly(3-thienyl)alkanesulfonic acids,40 and on protonation studies of oligomers34 which is reported to occur through the addition of hydrogen at the α-site of the thiophene ring. In this mechanism, protonated P3HT at the polymer–electrolyte interface receives electrons that are photogenerated in the bulk of the film, resulting in the release of hydrogen and reformation of the neutral polymer at the surface. The latter is subsequently reprotonated, and primed for the next reduction cycle, while photogenerated holes in the film migrate to the anode to complete the circuit.

Conclusions
RR-P3HT is photoelectrochemically active in aqueous solution yielding tens of μA cm−2 of photocurrent. Thicker films provide larger photocurrents but at reduced power efficiencies. Photocurrents and power efficiencies are 10 times greater than regiorandom polymer analogues. Spectroscopic and electrochemical evidence suggests RR-P3HT is protonated only at the polymer–electrolyte interface, leading to the speculation that photocathode activity of RR-P3HT originates from reduction of the protonated surface, with subsequent elimination of molecular hydrogen. Elucidation of the mechanism and rate-determining steps should provide the insights needed to increase photo-conversion efficiencies.
