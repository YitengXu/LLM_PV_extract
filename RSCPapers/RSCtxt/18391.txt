    , Accepted 13th February 2016First published on 15th February 2016AbstractSemi-transparent rounded Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) nanosheet networks were in situ grown on a FTO glass substrate, via an effective solution method, without any post-treatments. An improved power conversion efficiency of 6.24% was obtained by applying CZTS nanosheet networks as a counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells. When assisted by a mirror reflection, the PCE increased to 7.12%.
The rapid expansion of cost-effective counter electrode (CE) catalysts for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has drawn extensive research interest.1–7 As an important component in DSSCs, the CE materials should possess two advantages of high catalytic activity and electrical conductivity.8,9 The high cost, low natural abundance, and poor corrosion resistance of Pt hinder the commercialization of DSSCs.10 Hence, to address the problem of high cost and instability of Pt CEs, many alternative Pt-free materials have been proposed to be used as CE catalysts, including carbon materials,11–13 conducting polymers,14 and inorganic compounds (transition metals in the form of oxides, nitrides, carbides, and sulfides).8 In particular, SnS(Se),15 CuSe(S),16 FeSe2,16,17 Ni0.85(Co0.85)Se,18 Co9S8,19 NiSe2,20 NiS,21,22 NiS2,23–25 Sb2S3,26 MoSe(S)2,27,28 CuInS2,29 Cu2FeSnS4,30etc. have been investigated as Pt-free CE materials in recent years and they have shown excellent catalytic activity towards the I−/I3− electrolyte. Among them, notably, p-type kesterite-structure Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) has been verified to be a high catalytic CE material, due to its advantages of earth abundance, low-toxicity, a direct band gap of 1.5 eV, and excellent catalytic ability towards the I3− electrolyte. The performance of the DSSCs with CZTS is comparable to that of the cell with Pt, indicating that the CZTS is an alternative material to Pt in DSSCs.31,32 Many techniques have been proposed to fabricate CZTS thin film CEs, such as vacuum based deposition,33,34 chemical vapour deposition, electrodeposition,35 and solution-based processing.36–43 The related CZTS-based device properties from the above reports are summarized in Table S1.† Among the fabrication methods proposed above, solution-based processing techniques have shown their remarkable potential for constructing low-cost, large-scale, and high-performance DSSCs. Furthermore, it is easy to acquire hierarchical nanostructure films with a large surface area, via varying the solvent, reactant, and long-chain surfactant, as the catalytic activity of a CE can be improved by altering the nanostructure of the material surface. Nevertheless, in a typical solution-based fabrication route, the nanostructure CZTS precursor film was firstly formed via spin, spray, or drop coating the CZTS inks/precursor solution on the substrate. Then, rigorous synthesis techniques are needed to meet the goals of pure phase, high crystallization and super catalytic activity, such as high temperature annealing or sulfurization (300 °C–600 °C under vacuum or sulfur-based vapour).44 Hence, it is necessary to in situ grow a highly crystalline, highly stable, and high-performance nanostructure CZTS thin film on a substrate, through a feasible, cost-effective, green, and mild solution-based method, without any post-treatments.
In this communication, we present an effective solution method to synthesize CZTS nanostructure networks in situ on a FTO glass substrate and utilize it directly as a CE to assemble DSSCs without any post-treatments, such as annealing, sulfurization, or coating with other ancillary materials. The fabrication process is schematically indicated in Fig. S1† and full experimental details are provided in the ESI.† Briefly, the Cu–Zn–Sn alloy composites were firstly electrodeposited on a FTO substrate and then were transferred to the CZTS phase directly by solvothermal treatment. During the solvothermal treatment, sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) powders serve as the sulfur source, but not sulfur powders. The S2O32− transforms to H2S and SO42− anions through a disproportionation process.45,46 The obtained SO42− and adsorbed trace water molecules function as a protective layer on the surface of the as-prepared CZT precursor and could promote the formation of a uniform inter-connected CZTS nanosheet network structure, as a result of shape control.46 Then, the H2S is also further decomposed to S2− species. In addition, if the surface of the porous CZT film has many small grain boundaries, then ethanol and the above sulfur species can easily permeate into the film to react with the CZT compound to form sulfide at low temperature and high pressure. The whole process is described as follows: S2O32− + H2O → SO42− + H2S(1) H2S → 2H+ + S2−(2) 2Cu + Zn + Sn + 4S2− → Cu2ZnSnS4↓(3)
Therefore, it is obvious that the existence of sodium thiosulfate in this work plays an important role in determining and controlling the morphology of CZTS. Optical and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of the as-prepared CZTS film are clearly presented in Fig. 1. It is apparent that the CZT film is just as smooth and bright as a reflective mirror, and the solvothermally obtained light-brown CZTS film is translucent from the optical images. The excellent transmittance suggests the CZTS film potential for more light coming into the cells from the counter electrode, so as to boost the photovoltaic performance. From Fig. 1(a), it can be seen that the porous and rough precursor CZT film is composed of homogeneous aggregated particles, with the diameter of ca. 50–65 nm. Notably, after the conversion process for 6 h, the resulting CZTS film shows a ca. ∼540 nm thick homogeneous and compact layer, adhered to the substrate tightly. Moreover, the whole FTO substrate is uniformly covered by the rounded CZTS nanosheet with a width of ca. 380–580 nm and a thickness of ca. 50–70 nm. The surface of CZTS sheet is extremely rough and composed of numerous nanoparticles with an expanding specific surface area. This inter-connected nanosheet network structure is beneficial for higher catalytic activity, as more electrolyte can anchor on the CZTS nanosheet and the photogenerated electrons can transfer through the sheet arrays into the conductive substrate fast and effectively.47 Furthermore, all the elements are homogeneously spread over the whole area of the substrate (Fig. S2(b–e)†).

The phase–structural information of the as-synthesized CZTS CE is illustrated in Fig. 2. The observed diffraction peaks show that kesterite-structure CZTS films (JCPDS 26-0575) are obtained during solvothermal treatment. The strong diffraction peaks around 28.5° and 47.3° are assigned to the crystal faces of (112) and (220), respectively. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the XRD profiles of tetragonal Cu2SnS3 (JCPDS 89-4714) and cubic ZnS (JCPDS 80-0020) are similar to that of the kesterite CZTS phase.32,42 The further structural information of the sample is obtained from the Raman spectrum. The peaks from Cu2SnS3 (352 cm−1), ZnS (278, 346 cm−1), and Cu2−xS (475 cm−1) phases are not observed in Fig. 2(b). The Raman peaks at 335 cm−1 and 288 cm−1 are from the kesterite CZTS phase. These results exclude the presence of other binary or ternary sulfide compounds, with only CZTS existing.35–40 To further study the detailed structures of the products, TEM measurements were subsequently performed. The two-dimensional characteristic of the nanosheet structures was confirmed. Moreover, the corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the tetragonal-structure CZTS plate displays several diffraction dots, demonstrating that it is a single crystal with great crystallinity. The presence of the major diffraction dots (112), (200), (220), and (312) is in good agreement with those reported in the literature. No apparent additional sulfide phases are observed and the pure phase of the CZTS film is further confirmed. From Fig. 2(d), the HR-TEM image clearly shows a set of crystallographic plane, which corresponds to the (112) planes of kesterite-structure CZTS.

Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs, assembled with CZTS and Pt CEs, were obtained under a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1 and each value for cell performance is determined as an average of at least three devices. It is indicated that the DSSCs with the rounded CZTS nanosheet CE show a great cell performance (η = 6.24%), which is superior to that of the DSSCs with Pt (η = 6.01%). The CZTS CE has a higher fill factor (FF = 62.92) than that of the Pt CE (FF = 61.42), resulting in higher power conversion efficiency (PCE). The enhanced FF is attributable to the lower RS and RCt from the EIS tests, demonstrating an improvement in charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface and low recombination rates (confirmed by a dark current test in Fig. S3†).17,48,49 Furthermore, a reflective mirror was used to improve the visible light utilization rate of the CZTS CE to achieve high transmittance, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The JSC increases from 12.52 to 14.31 mA cm−2, when reflecting the light penetrating through the solar cell, and the PCE increases from 6.24 to 7.12% accordingly. The high catalytic ability of rounded CZTS nanosheet networks in DSSCs could be caused by the following reason: first, plate-based catalytic networks not only increase the catalytic surface area of the electrode film but also accelerate the photogenerated electron transport at the counter electrode/redox electrolyte interface;33,49 second, according to the quantum chemistry predictions, the (202) surface of metal sulfide has overpotential behaviour in O2 reduction similar to that observed for platinum electrodes, indicating that the special surface structure of metal sulfide benefits the reduction of I3− ions.50,51 Furthermore, it is also important to note that chemical stability toward the electrolyte and mechanical stability are the fundamental requirements for the stable and high-efficiency CZTS electrode. The long-term stability test of DSSCs based on the CZTS CE was implemented for 7 days, as shown in Fig. S4.† After 7 days, the parameters of the FF, and efficiency retained 98, and 97% of the initial values, respectively. A mechanical peel-off test was also performed, by sticking 3M Scotch tape on the surface of the CZTS film and then peeling the tape off, to investigate the mechanical stability. After peeling off 10 times, the CZTS film was still strongly bound to the substrate, and the efficiency retained 91% of the initial values (as shown in Fig. S5†), suggesting the good mechanical stability of the prepared CE.

The electrocatalytic activity of the CZTS and Pt electrode was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in the triiodide electrolyte. Fig. 3(b) shows that the rounded CZTS nanosheet CE has excellent electrochemical stability in I−/I3− solutions. Two typical pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks appear in CV curves for both CE samples. The redox peaks at more negative potentials, represented by peak I and peak I′, correspond to the reduction of I3− to I−, and the redox peaks at more positive potentials, represented by peak II and peak II′′, correspond to the oxidation of I− to I3−:17
Two main parameters from the CV curve represent the overall electrocatalytic abilities towards the reduction of I3− to I−; they are: (1) the peak-to-peak separation (ΔEP) and (2) the cathodic peak current density (IP) at more negative potentials. The CZTS nanosheet CE demonstrates higher IP values than that of the commercial Pt, for both the anodic and cathodic sides. It is implied that the electrocatalytic ability of the rounded CZTS nanosheet networks towards the I−/I3− redox couple is better than that of the Pt CE, in accordance with the observations from previous literature.32–34 In addition, the value of ΔEP (0.60 V) for CZTS is small than that of the Pt (0.71 V), and the peak position for the reduction reaction is nearly the same, confirming the higher catalytic activity toward the reduction of triiodide. Furthermore, the catalytic reaction is a kinetic process, which is related to the electron transfer rate constant and the number of active sites. The area of peak I′ is wider for the rounded CZTS nanosheet networks than that for Pt, indicating that the CZTS nanostructure has provided more catalytic reaction sites than the Pt CE. The long-term stability of the CZTS CE was also tested against the I−/I3− electrolyte by subjecting the electrodes to 20 potential successive cycles, as shown in Fig. S6.† The value of IP decreases by about 14% after 20 cycles of potential scanning. Thus, the rounded CZTS nanosheet network CE has superior catalytic activity properties compared to Pt. The conclusion from the CV data is consistent with the previous PCE results. The electron conductivity, mass diffusion and catalytic activity of the as-obtained CZTS could be effectively derived from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which was conducted on the symmetrical CZTS and Pt electrochemical cells, as shown in Fig. 3(c). The detailed electrochemical parameters of the symmetrical cells extracted by fitting the EIS spectra are summarized in Table S2,† including RS, RCt, and Cμ values. The RS value is mainly composed of the resistance of the FTO substrate, the bulk resistance of CZTS, and the contact resistance. The smaller bulk resistance of CZTS and the better adhesion between the catalytic layer and the substrate are responsible for the smaller RS values. The RS value of CZTS CEs (12.44 Ω cm−2) is low, reflecting a good conductivity and bonding strength between the in situ CZTS film and the FTO substrate, which in turn promotes the transfer of more electrons from the external circuit or of holes from the electrolyte to the CEs.52 Furthermore, the RS greatly affects the FF and JSC of the solar cell, with a higher FF and JSC resulting from the smaller RS value, which is consistent with the result of photovoltaic performance. It is also worth noting that the in situ grown nanostructure CZTS film exhibits RCt values (4.82 Ω cm−2) that are well below the 10 Ω cm−2 level needed for high-performance solar cells, and even smaller than that of the Pt electrode, suggesting the eximious catalytic activity of the CZTS CE.15 The small value of RCt is due to the high contact surface area and the fast electron-transfer pathway of CZTS nanosheet networks. In addition, a high Cμ value (11.94 μF) represents a large surface area of the CZTS CE, concordant with the results obtained from the FE-SEM. Accordingly, the rounded CZTS nanosheet network CE shows highly active catalytic properties for the reduction of I3−, which agrees well with the CV results. To support EIS and CV data, Tafel polarization measurements were also carried out with the same symmetrical cells to further confirm the contribution of the electron-transfer rate to the improvement of PCE. It can be seen in Fig. 3(d) that the CE with the CZTS nanosheet shows higher J0 than Pt, suggesting better electrocatalytic activity, in good agreement with the tendency of the cathodic peak current observed in the CV profile. The J0 value is directly related to the charge transfer resistance (RCt) and is supplied by the following eqn (4), thus reconfirming the smaller charge transfer resistance on the CZTS electrode.52 The above observation is well consistent with the results for RCt values revealed by EIS spectra. J0 = RT/nFRCt(4)(4)where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature in K, n is the number of electrons involved in the electrochemical reduction reaction, F is the Faraday constant, and RCt is the charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface obtained from EIS spectra. The limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) is also deduced from the Tafel curve at high potential. Jlim is closely related to the catalytic activity of the catalyst. The Jlim value of the CZTS electrode (1.03 mA cm−2) is higher than that of the Pt electrode (0.87 mA cm−2), demonstrating a higher diffusion coefficient, as shown in eqn (5). Jlim depends on the diffusion coefficient of the redox couple in the electrolyte. This Tafel polarization result is consistent with the EIS and CV results. D = lJlim/2nFC(5)where D is the diffusion coefficient of the I3−, l is the electrolyte thickness, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of I3− at the counter electrode, F is the Faraday constant, and C is the iodic concentration.
The semi-transparent rounded CZTS nanosheet networks were in situ grown on the FTO glass substrate, via a feasible solution method, based on room temperature electrodeposition and solvothermal treatment. The electrodeposited CZT precursor film was completely converted to CZTS nanosheet networks after a mild solvothermal treatment. The corresponding SAED pattern of the tetragonal-structure CZTS nanosheet demonstrated that it is a single crystal with great crystallinity. The DSSCs assembled with the rounded CZTS nanosheet networks show the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.24%, which was higher than that of Pt (6.01%). It is noted that, PCE increased to 7.12% under the assistance of a mirror. The expanded catalytic surface area, high photogenerated electron injection at the counter electrode/redox electrolyte interface, great electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction, low charge transfer resistance toward the reduction of I3− ions, and high diffusion coefficient of the I3− boost the improved performance of DSSCs. However, it is still noteworthy that, though relatively good long-term stability of the CZTS CE in the electrolyte has been confirmed by conducting reproducibility measurements, peel-off tests, and consecutive CV scans, the real long-term stability of these integrated solar cell devices and first-principle density functional theory (DFT) calculation are still needed to be further assessed and conducted, as this should be of great importance for their practical applications, and, we will continue to work on this issue.
