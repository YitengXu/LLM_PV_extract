    AbstractIn this study, the injection efficiencies and photovoltaic device performances for two different phthalocyanine sensitisers—a Zn(II)Pc (TT-1) and a Ru(II)Pc (TT-35) in dye sensitized photoelectrochemical solar cells were compared. These dyes have similar structures and energetics, but differ significantly in their photophysics, with TT-1 exhibiting a reasonably long lived singlet state, whilst TT-35 exhibits rapid intersystem crossing to a long lived triplet state. Time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) approach and incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were applied to study the injection efficiency of these two Pc dyes. A comparison of the injection efficiency determined by the two independent techniques, TCSPC and IPCE analysis, shows a good agreement. TT-35 shows higher injection efficiency in comparison to TT-1. This result is consistent with the relative energy and lifetime of the TT-35 triplet state compared to the TT-1 singlet excited state. The high injection efficiency and the long electron diffusion length shown by TT-35 make this dye an interesting red absorbing sensitizer for dye solar cells.

Broader context
Understanding the relationship between a dye structure and its behaviour is critical for focussing research and design of new molecules for sensitising nanocrystalline semiconductor solar cells (DSSCs). Our study concerns a comparison between two similar phthalocyanines dyes: a zinc(II) cored (TT-1) and the ruthenium(II) (TT-35) one, where changing the metal centre from zinc(II) to ruthenium(II) changes the nature of the excited state that passes the electron to the semiconductor (injection) from singlet to triplet. A comparison in the injection properties has been carried out with two independent techniques which showing good agreement. We conclude that the injection dynamics are approximately independent of the excited spin state of the dye, but that the overall efficiency of the injection process depends strongly upon the energy of the injecting state and the lifetime of the competing decay pathway of excited state to ground. Despite being a long lived triplet injector, TT-35 showed higher injection efficiency than TT-1. It is thus apparent that ultrafast electron injection is not a prerequisite for efficient PV device function. We find that the higher injection efficiency shown by TT-35 in comparison to TT-1 is the primary reason for the better energy conversion of absorbed photons observed for this dye.

Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are potentially a low cost alternative to inorganic silicon based photovoltaics.1 The most successful charge transfer sensitizers employed so far in these cells are polypyridyl-type complexes of ruthenium.2,3 In DSSCs the primary charge separation step is the electron injection from the dye excited state into the TiO2 conduction band. Extensive studies of this electron injection process in TiO2/Ru–bipyridyl dye films coated in inert solvent have shown sub-picosecond injection dynamics,4,5 orders of magnitude faster than the competing process of excited state decay to ground. As such, electron injection has not generally been considered to be a key factor limiting device performance, with most studies of device optimisation focusing upon optimising the light absorption and electron collection aspects of device function.6 However, we have recently reported both ultrafast transient absorption and time correlated single photon counting studies of electron injection in a complete DSSC. In contrast to film studies, these studies on devices have shown a much slower electron injection halftime of ∼150 ps, slow enough for kinetic competition between electron injection and excited state decay to have a potentially significant impact upon device performance.7–9 The slower dynamics in the complete DSSC were attributed to the presence of additives typically added to the device electrolyte to improve photovoltaic performance.9,10 In previous studies we have investigated the influences of the dye structure or the dye excited state energy on the injection efficiency.11,12
Moreover, it is desirable to enhance the NIR absorption of devices in order to improve their light harvesting ability. Phthalocyanines (Pcs) possess intense absorption bands in the red-near NIR region and are known for their excellent stability, rendering them attractive for photovoltaic applications.13,14 Moreover, depending on the central metal and the peripheral substituents, they can have appropriate redox properties for the sensitization of TiO2 films and dye regeneration by the I−/I3− electrolyte. However, the application of Pc dyes in DSSCs has been restricted due to problems associated with aggregation of the dye on the metal oxide surface, resulting in rapid deactivation of the dye excited state and low sensitising efficiency. In addition, the introduction of peripheral groups on the Pcs required for anchoring to the TiO2, usually leads to a poor solubility and/or aggregate formation. An effective strategy to reduce Pc aggregation is the introduction of axial ligands strongly bound to the central metal of a metalloPc (MPc), preventing the π–π interaction between adjacent macrocycles. In this regard, ruthenium(II)Pcs are attractive dyes as they exhibit an intense absorption in the region between 630 and 670 nm and strongly coordinate one or two pyridine axial ligands. Several examples of RuPcs have been reported in which the dye is attached to the TiO2via axial ligands or through anchoring groups on the macrocycle periphery.15–17 Promising photovoltaic responses were obtained, although efficiencies remained ≤0.5%. Additionally, desorption problems have been detected when the anchoring comes through a carboxy group at the axial pyridine ligand. A significant advance for the application of Pcs in DSSC, came from the preparation of highly soluble carboxy-Zn(II)Pc derivative TT-1 (see Fig. 1) which exhibited both reduced tendency towards aggregation and a “push–pull” structure with the carboxy group directly attached to the macrocycle, thus potentially facilitating the charge transfer from the LUMO orbital of the dye to the TiO2. DSSC device efficiencies above 3.5% at 1 sun have now been reported employing this TT-1 sensitiser.18
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of ZnPc TT-1 and RuPc TT-35. 
To date, Zn(II) and Ru(II)Pcs bearing the same peripheral substitution pattern have not been accurately compared as sensitizers in DSSCs under the same experimental conditions. Whereas changing ligands results in typically only small differences in the photophysical properties of Pcs, the photophysics can be strongly affected by the introduction of different metal ions at the central cavity of the macrocycle. In the search of an optimized Pc-based DSSC, it is important to know whether the different photovoltaic performance of Zn(II)Pc (singlet injector) versus Ru(II)Pc (triplet injector) sensitized dyes are due to changes in the electron injection step.
In this paper we compare, for the first time, a singlet versus a triplet injector dye having otherwise a similar structure. The dyes investigated in this study are two peripherally unsymmetrically substituted phthalocyanines shown in Fig. 1: the Zn(II)Pc TT-1 and the Ru(II)Pc TT-35, both bearing the same peripheral substituents. The Zn(II) metal centre only slightly affects the photoinduced pathway for Pc dyes relative to free base; in contrast Ru(II) plays an important role, being an heavy metal it promotes intersystem crossing to the triplet state, as recently shown for similar Pc dyes.12
Here we report a comparison in the injection properties determined with two independent techniques of the two similar dyes. In the Results and discussion section we present data showing optical properties of the dyes and devices, the photoelectrochemical performance of the devices, and their injection yields. These observations are considered in terms of the injection and excited state decay dynamics. We conclude that the injection dynamics are approximately independent of the excited spin state of the dye, but that the overall efficiency of the injection process depends strongly upon the energetic of the injecting state and the lifetime for the competing excited state decay pathway to ground.
Methods
1. Synthesis
The preparation of carboxyphthalocyanines TT-1 and TT-3519 was accomplished from the corresponding aldehyde derivative, by oxidation with NaClO2 in the presence of sulfamic acid, as described before for the case of TT-1.18 The purity of the compounds was checked by 1H NMR, UV/vis, and mass spectrometry.
2. Cell fabrication
Dye-sensitized TiO2 cells were made with standard techniques.20 Commercial TiO2 particles have been used (Dyesol: 20 nm anatase particles suspended 20% by weight as a colloid in an acidic solution pH < 2, made into a paste by adding hydroxypropyl cellulose, poly(ethylene glycol), and HNO3). Layers of the TiO2 particles (∼7 µm) were deposited by doctor blading on FTO glass. The layers were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. An additional TiCl4 treatment was applied.21 The resultant films were reheated at 450 °C, cooled to about 100 °C and placed into the dye solution (2 × 10−5 M (concentrated ones) and 2 × 10−6 M (diluted ones) in CH2Cl2) overnight. The cells geometry was 1 × 1 cm. The electrolyte composition was: 0.6 M PMMI; 0.04 M I2; 0.1 M LiI; 0.05 M GuSCN; 0.0 M tBP; 15:85 AN:VN. For the preparation of the non-injecting cells a film (∼7 µm thick) of Al2O3 particles were placed into the dye solution (2 × 10−5 M in CH2Cl2) overnight.
3. 
          I–V measurements setup
The current–voltage characteristics of the cells were determined by illuminating using a 150 W xenon lamp (Sciencetech model SS150Wsolar simulator), equipped with an IR filter (water filter) removing wavelengths >1000 nm and an AM 1.5 filter (Sciencetech). The intensity was adjusted using a calibrated silicon photodiode (model PBW21) to give an intensity approximately equivalent to that of a 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G spectrum over the wavelength range of interest. Current and voltage were measured and controlled using a Keithley 2400 source meter.
4. IPCE setup
Incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were made using a 100 W tungsten halogen lamp (Bentham IL1 with Bentham 605 stabilized current power supply) coupled to a monochromator with computer controlled stepper motor (Bentham M300, 300 mm focal length, slit width 3.7 nm, 1800 lines per m grating). Full details are reported elsewhere.22 The absorbed photon conversion efficiency (APCE) was calculated by dividing the IPCE by the cells optical absorption.
5. Deriving injection efficiency using the IPCE analysis method
The incident photon conversion efficiency method for the determination of the diffusion length L of the electrons through the nanoparticles and the injection efficiency ηinj of the dye has been presented in recent paper of Barnes et al.22 The parameters ηinj and L were derived for each cell by fitting a model to IPCE and optical data. The key to this analysis is the relationship between η(λ) and L so that if sufficient optical measurements are made, IPCE (λ) can be described by a function where the only unknowns are ηinj and L. Moreover, the ratio of IPCE (λ) measured from the back and front sides (in the case of a transparent cell) depends only on L. This approach has showed very good results, for the calculation of L and ηinj and their relationship to the photocurrent of a wide range of cells.22
6. Time correlated single photon counting measurements
For finding injection efficiencies, pairs of otherwise identical injecting and non-injecting cells were measured using TCSPC. The injecting cells used a nanocrystalline TiO2 film, the non-injecting cells used a nanocrystalline Al2O3 film (which has no states available for electron injection). This technique for collecting TCSPC measurements is also described in previous work.7,8 A JobinYvon TBX Flurocube system used a laser pulse (wavelength 635 nm) to excite dye molecules within the cells at a repetition rate of 1 MHz and average intensity of 80 µW cm−2. The resulting photoluminescence intensity was measured as a function of time after the excitation pulse. The instrument response function was also measured using the same experimental geometry and typically had a 200–250 ps full width half-maximum.
7. Deriving injection efficiency using the SPC analysis method
Since excited dye states are unable to inject charge into Al2O3, there is no equivalent route for photoluminescent quenching. Thus analysis of the TiO2 and the Al2O3 cell photoluminescence decays allows the electron injection yield from the dye to the TiO2 to be determined (equivalent to ηinj). All emission decay traces were normalised for a number of photons absorbed at the 635 nm excitation wavelength. The photoluminescence relaxation could be well fit by the numerical convolution of the instrument response (IRF) with a stretched exponential function.7,8 The stretched exponential function gives a good empirical description of v (counts s−1), the rate of photoluminescence of excited dye molecules with time (t): v = v0e−(t/τww)β(1)
A least squares fit of convolution of the IRF and eqn (1) to the photoluminescence decay for the non-injecting cell allowed the parameters v0, the initial photoluminescence rate, τww and β, parameters describing the shape of the decay. In the case where β = 1, the function describes a single exponential decay where the lifetime, τ = τww. The fit was weighted by the standard deviation of the background signal.
At short times before significant injection has occurred into the TiO2 the initial intensity of photoluminescence (v0) should be the same for injecting and non-injecting cells. We can thus use v0 determined from the noninjecting fit to constrain the fit to the photoluminescent decay of the injecting cell. This is useful because v0 would otherwise be too obscured by the instrument response time to determine reliably; this approach allows us to quantify the presence of any electron injection occurring within our instrument response. Thus the fit to the injecting cell decay has only two free parameters τww and β. The stretched exponential function is assumed to describe a distribution of single exponential decay processes with different lifetimes, where the average lifetime (τ) is given using a Gamma function (Γ): (2)
This average lifetime can be used to give rate of electron injection according to kinj = 1/τ. The injection yield can be found by taking the ratio of the integrated area under the injecting (vTiO2) to non-injecting (vAl2O3) decays: (3)
Results and discussion
1. Dye properties
As mentioned in the Introduction, the absorption and emission properties of Pc dyes can be strongly affected by the introduction of different metal ions at the central cavity of the macrocycle. Thus, the dilute solution absorption spectra of the TT-35 and TT-1 dyes, in Fig. 2, show quite different Q bands, both in energy and extinction coefficients. The ZnPc TT-1 spectrum in THF shows an intense (extinction coefficient 165000 mol−1 cm−1) and slightly split Q band centred at 680 nm. On the contrary, and in agreement with other Ru(II)Pcs, the spectrum of RuPc TT-35 presents a much broader Q band absorption (extinction coefficient 95000 mol−1 cm−1) at 636 nm. In both cases, the extinction coefficients, especially in the red spectral region, are high, indicating these dyes are especially suited for use in DSSCs employing thin TiO2 films.
 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of TT-1 (black) and of TT-35 (grey) in THF at 298 K. 
Cyclic voltammetry was used to gain information of the first oxidation of both dyes and therefore about the HOMO level energy. Whereas phthalocyanine TT-1 exhibited quasi-reversible oxidation at 0.66 V versus SCE, the RuPc TT-35 showed an oxidation peak at slightly more positive potential (0.72 V).
Once adsorbed onto titania surface, Fig. 3, TT-1 shows a significant change in its optical absorption. The ratio between the split Q bands change drastically in comparison of the solution absorption. The increase of the higher energy shoulder is a clear indication of an interaction between packed dyes on the TiO2 surface.13,14,18 This interaction is confirmed with the time correlated single photon counting TCSPC analysis, reported below. The aggregation is usually due to intermolecular π–π interactions and is not present in the case of TT-35. π–π interactions are a common issue for organic dyes, which can be reduced by the presence of a metal centre in the dye. The ruthenium atom centre requires 6 coordinative ligands in comparison to the 4 required by zinc and so leads to a less packed organization on the surface. Another issue is the different tendency for these two dyes to stick to the surface. The films were immersed into the dye solution for 24 h at room temperature, rinsed with ethanol to remove any unadsorbed dye, TT-1 films shown a much stronger absorption than the TT-35 films (see Fig. 3). This is an indication of a better loading of TT-1 on titania.

Fluorescence emission spectra of reference compounds TT-1 and TT-35 were recorded in ethanol solution and were found to be independent of the excitation wavelength (Fig. 3).

TT-1 is a strongly emissive molecule in the red spectral region (λmax = 705 nm). On the other hand TT-35 exhibits almost no fluorescence emission up to 850 nm. This prevented investigation of TT-35 dye injection dynamics with TCSPC technique with our equipment. For a similar RuPc dye time-resolved emission measurements resolved a phosphorescence emission maximum at 880 nm.12 This emission, assigned to the RuPc triplet state, exhibited for TT-35 monoexponential decay with a lifetime of 89 ns (inset, Fig. 5).
2. Cell characterization

Fig. 4a shows the current–voltage characteristics of the cells examined in this study. The efficiencies are shown in Table 1. The TT-1 based cell showed higher performance than the TT-35 one due to ∼20% higher photocurrent. The photocurrent action spectrum is shown in Fig. 4b where the incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) and the absorbed photon conversion efficiency (APCE) are plotted as a function of wavelength. The spectrum extends well into the near IR region displaying a maximum around 700 nm for TT-1. With an electrolyte containing a high lithium concentration (see Methods section) the performances of the RuPc (TT-35) based cell are in the same order of magnitude of the ZnPc (TT-1) one, with a total external efficiency of ∼1%, see Fig. 4a and Table 1. The composition of the employed electrolyte is quite different to the one used in previous studies on phthalocyanine dyes,18 it contains in fact high concentration of Li+ and small amount of tBP in order to lowering the conduction band of the TiO2 matrix.9

Despite its lower absorbance, the TT-35 dye-based cell shows a good photocurrent–voltage (I/V) performance (Fig. 4b), with an APCE response in fact higher that the obtained for the TT-1-based one. The higher photocurrent shown by the TT-1 based device is mainly due to its stronger light harvesting efficiency (see Fig. 3). Fig. 4b reports the difference between the IPCE and the APCE response of the dyes. IPCE is defined as the ratio of electrons produced as current to photons incident on the device surface. APCE is the ratio of electrons produced as current to photons absorbed in the device. As a result of stronger light harvesting TT-1 showed a higher IPCE than TT-35. However, the product of the injection and collection efficiency (which accounts for photons that are absorbed by the dye and are then converted to current following injection and collection) of the TT-35 cell was greater than the TT-1 cell as indicated by its higher APCE.23,24

Table 2 shows the values of the weighted mean collection efficiency derived from analysis of front and back excitation IPCE data assuming first order recombination in electrons using the technique reported elsewhere.25TT-1 based cell showed a shorter diffusion length (L ≈ 8 µm) which corresponds to 0.93 collection efficiency (ηcol) in comparison to TT-35 (L > 12 µm) which corresponds to ηcol > 0.97. This difference accounts for only a minor fraction of the difference between the performances of the cells. The shorter diffusion length shown by TT-1 based cells can be rationalized on the basis of recent experiments showing these dyes can effectively catalyse recombination between electrons and redox iodine based mediator.26 Interestingly this ‘catalytic’ behaviour seems to be reduced in the case of the TT-35 based cell.

3. Injection efficiency
The time-resolved emission profiles of TT-1 in two working devices made with films dipped in 2 different concentration dye solutions and in two control ones are reported in Fig. 5 (see Methods section).
 Fig. 5  Transient emission decays of TT-1 10−5 M ethanol solution (orange), TT-1|Al2O3 (wine), TT-1|TiO2 (red) (from diluted solution) and TT-1|Al2O3 (blue), TT-1|TiO2 (light blue) (from concentrated solution); (λexc = 635 nm and λdet > 645 nm). The instrument response function (IRF) is shown in black. Inset: emission decays of TT-35/ZrO2 film (λexc = 630 nm and λdet = 880 nm). 
The TT-1-based cell showed a pronounced dependence on dye loading concentration. As already anticipated from the discussion of the optical properties, the π−π interactions between the surface absorbed dyes affect the fluorescence emission decays. This also occurs in the presence of chenodeoxycholic acid (Cheno), a co-adsorbant usually utilized to avoid this kind of interactions.18,27 Thus, devices made from a concentrated solution of the dye showed a stronger quenching of the luminescence (Fig. 5). It is interesting to note that dye molecules sensitising an Al2O3 film prepared by immersion in diluted TT-1 solution (2 × 10−6 M, 4 h dye loading) showed a faster emission decay (0.4 ns) in comparison with the fluorescence lifetime determined in solution (3.5 ns). This is unusual because Al2O3 is an inert matrix does not allow quenching by electron injection from the absorbed dyes and suggests that the TT-1 dyes are self-quenching of on surface metal oxide surface. In the case of a device or a control made by immersing the film into a higher concentration TT-1 solution (2 × 10−5 M) we determine even shorter decay dynamics, ranging from 5 to 50 ps, within the accuracy of the technique.
Injection quantum yields (ηinj) were determined (eqn (4)) by the comparison of the emission lifetime k0 = 1/τ0 for the dye absorbed on the alumina compared with that of the dye on titania kobs = 1/τobs: (4) Kinj+k0 = kobs(5) (6)
We obtain ηinj = 0.48 injection efficiency in the case of TT-1 from diluted solution. Given the interactions present between the dyes we expect uncertainty in the injection efficiency determination. Despite this the value shows good agreement with the independently determined value from the analysis of IPCE (ηinj ≈ 0.45, see Table 2). Table 2 also shows the values determined from the TCSPC analysis in comparison to those from the IPCE.
The value of ηinj obtained for the TT-35 cell from IPCE analysis was ∼0.8 (Table 2). The higher injection efficiency and slightly lower collection losses in TT-35 compared to TT-1 are the reasons for the higher APCE observed. Thus we would expect a thicker cell fabricated using TT-35 to exceed the performance of a TT-1 based cell, this is being investigated elsewhere.
In order to rationalize the higher ηinj of TT-35 relative to TT-1 observed with IPCE measurements, we can estimate the expected injection rate of TT-35 to give an independent estimate of its injection efficiency from the dye kinetics. The estimate can be made if the injection rate from the excited singlet state (TT-1) and the difference between the singlet (TT-1) and the triplet (TT-35) energy levels are known. The electron injection rate constant is proportional to the density of acceptor states g(E) and the nuclear (Vn) and electronic (Vel) coupling between the dye and the electron acceptor states in the semiconductor: kinj ∝ VelVng(E)(7)
We assume the coupling between the phthalocyanine dyes and the TiO2 acceptor states is approximately the same for both the TT-1 (singlet injector) and the TT-35 (triplet state injector) since the anchoring moieties are identical. Commonly, the density of electron acceptor states in nanocrystalline TiO2 is assumed to have an exponential dependence on the energy of the states, E: g(E) ∝ eE/E0(8)where E0 gives a measure of the “steepness” of the electron acceptor state distribution, and varies from 60 to 150 mV according to literature.28 Using eqn (7) and 8 we can estimate the TT-35 injection rate according to:  where singlet, ES1(TT-1), and triplet, ET1(TT-35), energies have been calculated using the emission maxima in solution for those dye (TT-1 = 705 nm, Fig. 3; TT-35 ≈ 880 nm,12) and the HOMO level energy was estimated by cyclic voltammetry (TT-1 = 0.66 V versus SCE; TT-35 = 0.72 V versus SCE). ΔE is found to be 410 mV. Using this value and the kinj(S1,TT-1) previously determined (Table 2), we obtained values for kinj(T1,TT-35) from (3 ns)−1 to (15 ns)−1 depending on the E0 used. These injection rates coupled with the decay lifetime of the TT-35 triplet state on Al2O3 (89 ns, inset in Fig. 5); give an estimated ηinj for TT-35 ranging from 0.97 to 0.85 using eqn (4). This is consistent with the injection efficiency (0.80–0.88) determined with IPCE analysis. The estimation indicates that the slow injection from the TT-35 triplet state (∼3 to 15 ns)−1 competes more effectively with relaxation to the ground state (89 ns)−1 than faster injection from the TT-1 singlet state (0.17 ns)−1 with its relative relaxation dynamics (0.4 ns)−1.
Conclusions
We have investigated a series of DSSCs made using phthalocyanine derivative dyes. The aim was to compare a pair of dyes with similar structure but differing injection states. The ruthenium phthalocyanine TT-35 is a triplet injector whereas the zinc derivative typically inject into the TiO2 conduction band from its singlet excited state. The injection efficiency determined by two independent techniques, TCSPC and IPCE analysis, showed good agreement in the case of TT-1. The injection efficiency for TT-35 could only be determined directly with IPCE analysis, however, the value was consistent with an indirect estimation using TCSPC data. Despite being a long lived triplet injector, TT-35 showed a higher injection efficiency than TT-1. It is thus apparent that ultrafast electron injection is not a prerequisite for efficient PV device function. The higher injection efficiency shown by TT-35 in comparison to TT-1 is the primary reason for the better energy conversion of absorbed photons observed for this dye.

Broader context
Understanding the relationship between a dye structure and its behaviour is critical for focussing research and design of new molecules for sensitising nanocrystalline semiconductor solar cells (DSSCs). Our study concerns a comparison between two similar phthalocyanines dyes: a zinc(II) cored (TT-1) and the ruthenium(II) (TT-35) one, where changing the metal centre from zinc(II) to ruthenium(II) changes the nature of the excited state that passes the electron to the semiconductor (injection) from singlet to triplet. A comparison in the injection properties has been carried out with two independent techniques which showing good agreement. We conclude that the injection dynamics are approximately independent of the excited spin state of the dye, but that the overall efficiency of the injection process depends strongly upon the energy of the injecting state and the lifetime of the competing decay pathway of excited state to ground. Despite being a long lived triplet injector, TT-35 showed higher injection efficiency than TT-1. It is thus apparent that ultrafast electron injection is not a prerequisite for efficient PV device function. We find that the higher injection efficiency shown by TT-35 in comparison to TT-1 is the primary reason for the better energy conversion of absorbed photons observed for this dye.
