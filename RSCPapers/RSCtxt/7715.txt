    , Accepted 27th May 2020First published on 27th May 2020AbstractPractical hydrogen production using high-efficiency, low-cost, and stable oxygen electrodes is crucial for a sustainable clean energy future. Herein we report a graphene-nanoplatelets-supported (Ni,Fe) metal–organic framework (MOF) as a superior and ultra-durable (>1000 h) anode for alkaline water electrolysis. The MOF on carbon-fiber paper electrodes requires an overpotential η = 220 mV to achieve a current density j = 10 mA cm−2 (η = 180 mV on nickel foam for j = 20 mA cm−2) with a Tafel slope of 51 mV per decade, high turnover frequency (1.22 s−1), high faradaic efficiency (99.1%), and long-term durability of >1000 h in continuous electrolysis. In an alkaline anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AAEMWE), it exhibits a record current density of 540 mA cm−2 at 1.85 V at 70 °C, outperforming the state-of-the-art Pt/C//IrO2. A breakthrough strategy introduced in membrane electrode assembly fabrication by extending the electrical contact with an aqueous electrolyte offers an additional OH− transport pathway to regenerate the original conductivity of the AAEMWE in continuous electrolysis, without any significant change in the pH of the electrolyte. These findings open up durable, high-performance AAEMWE and direct solar-to-fuel conversion, especially to replace high-cost proton exchange membrane water electrolysis that already works with ultra-pure water.

Broader context
Successful commercialization of the splitting of water into hydrogen necessitates high-efficiency and low-cost oxygen electrodes that oxidize water at the near thermodynamic barrier (1.23 eV) with outstanding durability. Here, we report a major advancement in the membrane electrode assembly fabrication method to develop a high-stability alkaline anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AAEMWE) for practical H2 production using metal organic framework (MOF)-derived electrocatalysts. A graphene nanoplatelets-supported NiFe-BTC MOF achieves a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 220 mV on a carbon-fiber paper electrode (180 mV on nickel foam for 20 mA cm−2) with long-term durability of >1000 h in continuous electrolysis, the best OER performance reported so far for MOF-based electrocatalysts in alkaline solution. Remarkably, it exhibits a record current density of 540 mA cm−2 at 1.85 V at 70 °C in AAEMWE. Also, it effectively converts solar energy to H2 without external bias when combined with commercial photovoltaics, demonstrating the feasibility of our system for energy and environmental applications. Overall, our findings not only highlight the design of an efficient oxygen-evolving catalyst but also provide a new route to achieve high-stability AAEMWE for industrial H2 production.

Introduction
Since the inception of the industrial revolution, an enormous amount of CO2 as a major greenhouse gas has been emitted causing global warming.1,2 A comprehensive strategy must be adopted to curb CO2 to create a friendly environment. In this regard, splitting water molecules to produce H2 as a fuel has been greatly appreciated due to its eco-friendly nature.3,4 However, the sluggish kinetics of the 4e− transfer OER at the anode is a bottleneck for water splitting efficiency. So far, precious metal-based RuO2/IrO2 nanomaterials have been used as OER electrocatalysts, but their high cost and poor stability impede large-scale practical applications. This issue may be overcome by utilizing transition metals and oxides, a promising alternative to precious metal oxides.4–7
In this direction, crystalline metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered as promising candidates for electrocatalysts due to their ultra-high surface area, tunable pore/channel structures, and abundant metal single-atom active sites. Significantly, the combination of accessible active sites (metal ions/clusters) with tunable pore structures allows a higher percentage of active site utilization compared to typical heterogeneous catalysts.8–11 However, the direct use of MOFs as electrocatalysts is hindered by their poor electrical conductivity and instability under harsh electrochemical conditions.9,12,13 Calcination is an effective strategy to improve the electrical conductivity of MOFs, yet the intrinsic metal active centers are destroyed.14 Converting bulk MOFs to 2D nanosheets improves the catalytic performance,13,15,16 and lattice strains in MOFs enhance mass activity in electrochemistry.17 Thus, effective strategies need to be developed to fully exploit the inherent potential of MOF structures for highly efficient electrocatalysts.
Herein we report a single-step and scalable synthesis of NiFe bimetallic MOFs supported on graphene-nanoplatelets (GNPs), using 1,3,5-benzene tricarboxylic acid (BTC) as an organic linker. Surprisingly, the MOFs supported on GNPs and loaded on carbon-fiber paper (CFP) exhibit excellent OER activity with low η = 220mV at j = 10 mA cm−2 (η = 180mV at j = 10mA cm−2 on nickel foam (NF)) and turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.22 s−1 in 1 M aqueous KOH. A highly stable j at constant η = 1.55 V is achieved for at least 288 h, and the associated faradaic efficiency is 99.1%. Further, as a non-platinum group metal (non-PGM) anode for the OER in alkaline anion exchange membrane (AAEM) water electrolysis (AAEMWE), our catalyst exhibited j = 540 mA cm−2 at 1.85 V at 70 °C with ultra-pure water electrolyte and demonstrated good solar-to-hydrogen efficiency when coupled with commercial photovoltaics.
Results and discussion
The NiFe-BTC-GNPs MOF catalyst was synthesized by mixing Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, GNPs and trimesic acid in a mixed 1:1:1 ratio of H2O:DMF:EtOH solution (Fig. 1). The morphology of NiFe-BTC-GNPs examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high-resolution tunneling electron microscopy (HRTEM) shows a rod-shaped morphology (Fig. S1, ESI†). The GNP sheets which provide faster charge-transfer in NiFe-BTC-GNPs during OER are successfully intertwined with NiFe-BTC MOF. No structural and morphological changes occurred in the NiFe-BTC rod-like morphology even after the GNP addition. The HRTEM image of NiFe-BTC shows lattice fringe spacings of 0.208 and 0.188 nm, corresponding to (111) and (200) planes of NiFe-BTC, respectively.18 The elemental mappings indicate that C, O, Fe and Ni are uniformly distributed in the NiFe-BTC catalyst (Fig. S1e and f, ESI†). The molecular structure of NiFe-BTC is shown in Fig. 2a based on powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) followed by geometry optimization using density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Method). For comparison, the Ni-BTC catalyst was also prepared without Fe ions. The PXRD patterns of NiFe-BTC and NiFe-BTC-GNPs MOFs agree well with those of simulated Ni-BTC (CCDC 1274034) and Fe-BTC (CCDC 171986) (Fig. 2b). NiFe-BTC and NiFe-BTC-GNPs exhibit similar XRD patterns, implying that the introduction of GNPs has no significant effect on the crystal structure. However, the characteristic peak of GNP (002) phase observed at 26.4° for NiFe-BTC-GNPs confirms the composite formation of NiFe-BTC and GNPs. In the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra obtained to investigate the functional groups (Fig. 2c), the peaks at 540 and 1643 cm−1 are attributed to bonding between metal ions and COO− groups of BTC, which reveals the successful coordination of Ni/Fe with the BTC linkers19,20 (Supplementary Note, ESI†). In the Raman spectrum of NiFe-BTC-GNPs (Fig. 2d), three additional bands at 480, 565 and 719 cm−1 of NiFe-BTC-GNPs (against Ni-BTC) are assigned to the characteristic bands of M–O–M and M–O (M = Ni2+/Fe3+) in MOF.21,22 The absence of the COOH peak around 1760–1690 cm−1 supports metal coordination with BTC.19,20 The high quality of few-layer graphene in NiFe-BTC-GNPs is evidenced from the appearance of low-intensity graphene D band (1350 cm−1) and the sharp narrow 2D band (2708 cm−1) over the G band (1582 cm−1) (I2D/IG = 5.0).23,24

As for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the binding energies of Ni2+ in NiFe-BTC and NiFe-BTC-GNPs are 855.4 and 855.7eV, respectively (Fig. 3a), which are 0.5–0.8eV higher than that of Ni2+ in Ni-BTC (854.9 eV), revealing that the addition of Fe3+ significantly influences the local electronic structure of Ni ions.25,26Fig. 3b–d show the high-resolution XPS spectra of the Ni, Fe and C for NiFe-BTC-GNPs MOF. The Ni-2p (Fig. 3b) exhibits binding energy peaks at 855.7 for Ni-2p3/2 and 873.5 eV for Ni-2p1/2, with two shakeup satellites, showing the +2 oxidation state of Ni in NiFe-BTC-GNPs.16,27 The Fe-2p shows two main peaks, ∼710.5 eV for Fe-2p3/2 and ∼723.0 eV for Fe-2p1/2, matching well with the characteristics of Fe3+ in NiFe-BTC-GNPs (Fig. 3c).28–30 The deconvoluted C-1s XPS spectra (Fig. 3d) reveal peaks at 284.8, 286.2, 288.7, and 292.1 eV assigned to the CC, C–O, COO–, and C(O)–O bonds, indicating the incorporation of GNPs into the NiFe-BTC-MOF.31,32 The O-1s spectra show three peaks at binding energies of 529, 531.3 and 532.8 eV corresponding to COO−, Ni/Fe–O−, and C–O, respectively (Fig. S5d, ESI†).27,31 Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis reveals 10% of Fe in the amount of metals (Fe + Ni) of NiFe-BTC-GNPs (which corresponds to Fe0.3Ni2.7-BTC2-GNPs) (Fig. S5b, ESI†), consistent with the precursor ratio used for the synthesis.

OER activity of MOFs in half-cell
The OER performances of NiFe-BTC-GNPs were evaluated using linear-sweep voltammetry (LSV) in O2-saturated 1 M aqueous KOH electrolyte using a standard three-electrode system with a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 (Fig. 4a). In the selected potential range, Ni-based MOFs show a typical oxidation peak at 1.35 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) due to the transformation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ in alkaline solution, prior to OER. However, introducing Fe into Ni-BTC shifts the anodic peak (Ni2+/Ni3+) towards more positive values and its redox behavior is significantly affected.33,34 Ni-BTC requires large η = 317 mV at j = 10 mA cm−2, while the Fe-doped Ni-BTC-MOF requires smaller η = 240 mV (Fig. 4a). The enhanced OER activity of NiFe-BTC can be ascribed to the change in electronic interaction (synergistic effect) of Ni and Fe metals.35–37 In the presence of GNPs, NiFe-BTC exhibits superior OER activity with η of 220 mV to drive 10 mA cm−2, much smaller than those of commercial IrO2 (η = 280 mV) and NiFeLDH (η = 250 mV). When 3D-conductive NF is used as a supporting electrode, NiFe-BTC-GNPs reaches j = 20 mA cm−2 at η = 180 mV (Fig. S3a, ESI†). The large specific surface area of GNPs provides increased OH− exposure to catalytic active sites and the high electrical conductivity promotes electron transfer at electrode–electrolyte interfaces during OER.23,38 At η = 300 mV, the NiFe-BTC-GNPs reaches very high j = 510 mA cm−2, ∼5-fold higher than commercial IrO2 (j = 100 mA cm−2); see Table S1 (ESI†) summarizing the OER performance of the present catalyst compared with that of other catalysts reported in the literature.

(b) Corresponding Tafel slope values. (c) Nyquist plots of the MOF samples at an overpotential of 270 mV along with the fitted RC circuit model. (d) Double-layer charging current vs. scan rate of Ni-BTC, NiFe-BTC, and NiFe-BTC-GNPs MOF. The linear slope is equivalent to the double-layer capacitance (Cdl). (e) ECSA-normalized current density of the MOF samples. (f) Mass activity and TOF of the catalysts at an overpotential of 300 mV. 
Based on the steady-state polarization plots (Fig. 4b), the Tafel slope is lower for NiFe-BTC-GNPs (51 mV dec−1) than commercial IrO2 (63 mV dec−1) and NiFeLDH (73 mV dec−1), which demonstrates the fast charge-transfer kinetics of NiFe-BTC-GNPs. Besides, the observation of a Tafel slope of 51 mV dec−1 indicates that OH− adsorption is favorable on the NiFe-BTC-GNPs surface, and the subsequent electrochemical desorption of OH− is the rate determining step.39,40
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measured as a function of applied anodic potential elucidates the charge-transfer kinetics of catalysts during OER. In Fig. 4c, all samples exhibit a non-ideal semicircle which is a characteristic feature of the charge-transfer process (faradaic process) during OER, and the origin of charge-transfer resistance (Rct) slightly shifts from zero, indicating the existence of series resistance (Rs). In addition, the suppressed Rct curve signifies uneven double-layer charging, and hence it will be replaced by a constant phase element (CPE) to interpret EIS data. Furthermore, the CPE comprises two parameters: CPE-Q (related to double-layer capacitance (Cdl)) and CPE-n (related to the microscopic surface roughness and interfacial heterogeneity at the catalyst layer).41 Consequently, the adopted Randles circuit (inset in Fig. 4c) reveals three elements (Rs, RCT, and CPE) demonstrating the accuracy of the fitting results. At an applied potential of 1.5 V, NiFe-BTC-GNPs show an Rct value of 3.6 Ω, much smaller than those of NiFe-BTC (11.6 Ω) and Ni-BTC (21.7 Ω), which reveals the high intrinsic charge-transfer of NiFe-BTC-GNPs during OER. Moreover, the strong interaction of GNPs and NiFe-BTC-MOF facilitates fast charge-transport from electrode and improved OER activity. Fast OER kinetics accelerates O2 generation at the electrode surface, increasing the microscopic surface roughness and inhomogeneity at the interfacial layer. In accordance with the Rct analysis, NiFe-BTC displays low CPE-n value (0.78) compared to Ni-BTC (0.88) and NiFe-BTC (0.86), indicating an increased surface roughness as well as interfacial heterogeneity at the catalyst layer.41,42 To further confirm the above findings, we measure the intrinsic electrical resistivity of the catalytic materials using four-point probe analysis (Fig. S3c, ESI†), which reveals high electrical conductivity of NiFe-BTC-GNPs compared to Ni-BTC and NiFe-BTC.16
Furthermore, an electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was estimated by measuring Cdl through cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans in the non-faradaic region with a potential range of 1.05–1.15 V vs. RHE.43,44 The Cdl value of NiFe-BTC-GNPs is calculated to be 1.0 mF, which is 1.7 and 2.4 times higher than those of NiFe-BTC (0.60 mF) and Ni-BTC (0.41 mF), respectively (Fig. 4d). The enhanced ECSA indicates the availability of more active sites which enable fast charge-transfer kinetics and optimal electrode–electrolyte interaction during OER.44,45 Consistently, contact angle measurements performed on MOF samples (coated on CFP) reveal surface wettability of electrodes; NiFe-BTC-GNPs exhibits a smaller contact angle (θ = 78°) than NiFe-BTC (θ = 94°) and Ni-BTC (θ = 109°) (Fig. S3d, ESI†). This is likely due to the presence of –OH groups in both BTC ligand and graphene surface as evidenced by the FTIR (ν–OH at 3500 cm−1, Fig. 2c) and XPS (C-1s spectra, Fig. 3d) spectra. Meanwhile, the decreased contact angle reflects high affinity towards water sorption and favorable contact at the electrode–electrolyte interface, facilitating gas bubble dissipation from electrode surfaces.25,45–47
Intrinsic OER activity of catalysts
When the current density was normalized to ECSA (Fig. 4e), NiFe-BTC-GNPs requires moderate η = 280 mV to achieve j = 10 mA cm−2, much smaller than those of NiFe-BTC (320 mV) and Ni-BTC (450 mV). Meanwhile, to investigate the intrinsic OER activity of BTC-derived catalysts, the calculated TOF and specific mass-activity at η = 300 mV in 1 M KOH solution are plotted27,43,44 (Fig. 4f). The TOF value for NiFe-BTC-GNPs catalyst is 1.22 s−1, which is 4.2- and 81-fold higher than those of NiFe-BTC and Ni-BTC, respectively. Remarkably, this TOF value is ∼130 times higher than that of commercial IrO2 (on glassy carbon electrode) and other previously reported catalysts, which demonstrates the superior OER activity of NiFe-BTC-GNPs. The mass-activity is 905 A g−1, much larger than those of NiFe-BTC (128 A g−1) and Ni-BTC (17.6 A g−1). These results demonstrate NiFe-BTC-GNPs as a low-cost and efficient OER material capable of emulating the role of precious metal oxides in practical alkaline water electrolyzers.
From the ring and disk currents obtained using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) (Fig. S4a–c, ESI†), average electron transfer number (N) is found to be 4 for NiFe-BTC-GNPs. Thus, the OER reaction follows a four-electron pathway generating O2 molecules.16,27,48,49 For faradaic efficiency measurements, the disk current (Id) was maintained at 200 μA for continuous O2 evolution, and subsequently the ring potential was set to 0.4 V (vs. RHE) to detect the amount O2 generated on the disk. The NiFe-BTC-GNPs catalyst shows a ring current of 36.7 μA (Fig. 5a), indicating a faradaic efficiency of 99.1% and O2 as a primary product.16,27 This was further confirmed by analyzing the water electrolysis products through the gas chromatography technique (Fig. 5b).

(c) OER performance of NiFe-BTC-GNPs before and after 50000 CV cycles. (d) Chronopotentiometric response of NiFe-BTC-GNPs at constant OER current density of 10 mA cm−2. (e) EIS spectra of NiFe BTC-GNPs electrode measured before and after continuous electrolysis. 
The stability of a catalyst is one of the important parameters to be analyzed for long-run operation which can be evaluated using accelerated degradation tests and chrono-potentiometric measurements. NiFe-BTC-GNPs shows substantial long-term cyclic OER durability even after 50000 CV cycles. Fig. 5c shows the comparative OER LSV data of the NiFe-BTC-GNPs catalyst which were recorded before and after 50000 CV cycles in O2-saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte. The LSV curves recorded before and after durability testing are almost unchanged, which shows excellent durability. Further, NiFe-BTC-GNPs exhibits an outstanding stability for more than 96 h in 1 M KOH at an applied j = 10 mA cm−2. For comparison, commercial IrO2 and alkaline benchmark NiFeLDH electrodes under similar conditions (Fig. 5d) showed a sharp decrease in voltage when operated for 24 h. This demonstrates that NiFe-BTC-GNPs exhibits excellent stability compared to state-of-the-art OER catalysts. The long-term stability of the NiFe-BTC-GNPs electrode can be attributed to several factors: (i) the large specific surface area of GNPs provides increased OH− exposure to catalytic active sites, (ii) the high electrical conductivity of GNPs promotes fast electron transfer at electrode–electrolyte interfaces during OER, and (iii) the NiFe-BTC-GNPs electrode exhibits favorable contact at the electrode–electrolyte interface, which facilitates fast gas bubble dissipation from the electrode surface at high current densities and enhances the durability. Besides, the EIS data measured after continuous electrolysis exhibit a low Rct value (2.7 Ω) compared to the original, which implies the increase in surface roughness of the electrode due to efficient water electrolysis (Fig. 5e). In addition, the post analysis data (such as HRTEM, XRD, ICP-MS, and XPS) of the electrodes recorded before and after long-term stability experiments show no significant changes in chemical composition, suggesting chemical and structural stability during OER (Fig. S5a–e, ESI†). Importantly, the initial rod-like structures of NiFe-BTC-GNPs are preserved even under highly corrosive OER conditions.
DFT calculations were also conducted to understand the active sites of NiFe-BTC and Ni-BTC. The theoretical overpotential (ηtheo) of NiFe-BTC is calculated as 239 mV at the Fe site which is very close to the experimental value (240 mV, Fig. S6, ESI†). On the other hand, the Ni site in Ni-BTC shows ηtheo = 520 mV. The lower overpotential of NiFe-BTC compared to Ni-BTC is well consistent with the experimental results.
OER activity of MOFs in single-cell tests
Here we demonstrate the real-time validation of BTC-derived electrocatalysts in a prototype AAEMWE configuration (Fig. 6a and Fig. S8a, b, ESI†), which consists of a commercial alkaline polymer electrolyte (FAA-3-PK-130, Fumatech) as a separator and ultra-pure water as electrolyte.

(c) The cell voltage recorded as a function of current after 30 min of electrolysis under each current density. (d) Change in the cell resistance measured in continuous electrolysis. (e) Long-term durability of the single cell measured at constant potential of 1.85 V. 
To develop an AAEMWE operated with ultra-pure (DI) water, it is necessary to utilize non-noble metal oxides for industrial H2 production, especially to replace high-cost proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis that already works with DI water.50–52 The use of DI water electrolytes instead of hydroxide, while advantageous from a corrosion point of view and alleviating shut-current problems, causes severe mass transport losses in continuous operation due to the pH gradient between cathode and anode. It also enhances the electrical resistance of the whole system and causes rapid degradation of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA).51 Recently, Kim et al. showed that a high concentration of ammonium enriches anion exchange ionomer at an electrode which can be used to maintain the high pH of the MEA without circulating corrosive alkaline solution. This approach enhances the AAEMWE performance, comparable to that of PEM electrolyzers. However, the limited durability of the above system could remain a significant challenge.1 To solve the problem, here we introduce a breakthrough strategy in MEA fabrication (Fig. 6b) by extending its electrical contact with an aqueous electrolyte (0.1 M KOH solution). The MEA fabricated with extended electrical contact creates an additional OH− transport pathway to regenerate its original conductivity and pH gradient between the electrodes in continuous operation with DI water, which significantly sustains the cell conductivity and decreases the MEA degradation. The EIS measurements conducted during the electrolyzer operation confirmed the above result. In addition, the pH analysis of the ultra-pure water electrolyte at regular time intervals shows no significant change in the electrolyte pH.
Benefiting from these structural merits, we fabricated a non-PGM AAEMWE with NiFe-BTC-GNPs MOF as an anode and MoNi4/MoO2 as a cathode, showing a high current density of 460 mA cm−2 at an applied cell voltage of 1.85 V at 50 °C in DI water. However, at 70 °C, our AAEMWE system displays maximum j = 540 mA cm−2 at 1.85 V, which outperforms the so far reported AAEMWEs working with DI water and 0.1 M NaOH/Na2CO3 electrolyte (Fig. 6c and Table 1) under similar operating conditions. Significantly, we achieved 140 mA cm−2 higher current density than a state-of-the-art NiFe/NF//Ni-MO electrolyzer reported by Zhuang et al.53 with high mass loading of 40 mg cm−2. Also, the cell comprised of commercial IrO2 as anode delivers a similar j at a cell voltage of 2.09 V, which is 0.240 V higher than that of the NiFe-BTC-GNPs-based electrolyzer (Fig. S9a, ESI†).

When the electrolyte was switched from DI water to 0.1 M aqueous KOH solution, our AAEMWE changes from a current density of 540 mA cm−2 to a high current density of 1150 mA cm−2 at 1.85 V (Fig. 6c), indicating that the additional OH− pathway has no influence on the electrolyte pH. Further, to confirm the effect of this unique structure, we measured the in-plane conductivity of the AEM (i.e. the total resistance along with the additional OH pathway), to validate that the ohmic loss across the OH pathway does not dominate the through-plane resistance within the MEA. As expected, the MEA with the additional OH− pathway shows less resistance (Fig. 6d) indicating that additional OH− supplement does not affect the MEA resistance theoretically. The above results clearly confirm that our system is working only with DI water electrolyte. Besides, the MEA without the additional OH− supplement continuously loses performance on continuous operation. However, our unique MEA sustained its conductivity and demonstrated exceptional stability in continuous electrolysis.
EIS measurements were performed as a function of applied cell voltage to validate the catalytic property of the material in solid polymer electrolyte. NiFe-BTC-GNPs exhibits small Rct and ohmic Rs (Fig. S10a, ESI†) in solid polymer electrolyte compared to 1 M KOH electrolyte. Further, a decreased Rct is observed upon increasing the cell voltage; hence, an enhanced charge-transfer between catalyst and electrolyte is observed. Therefore, the accelerated device performance is validated during operation. This is mainly due to the use of AAEMWE binder on the electrode (during catalyst ink preparation) which facilitates effective three-phase boundaries throughout electrodes for improved charge transport and sustains the conductivity of MEA during continuous operation (Fig. 6d). The performance can also be improved by circulating the electrolyte effectively to remove the gas bubbles from the electrode surface and thus reducing shunt current problems due to potential drop across the electrodes.49,50
The long-term stability of the single cell was evaluated by applying a constant voltage of 1.85 V in galvanostatic mode (Fig. 6e). During the stability study, the cell displayed constant j = 460 mA cm−2 for 72 h. Although there is a small potential drop observed due to conductivity loss of the MEA during the continuous operation, overall it demonstrates stability retention of 95.8% with an impressive MEA degradation rate of 0.27 mA h−1. These findings are major advancements in AAEMWE development and open up new opportunities to achieve high-performance and durable AAEMWE for commercial applications using low-cost materials. Significantly, our NiFe-BTC-GNPs anode exhibits exceptional stability of >1000 h in continuous electrolysis, while considering the overall stability in both half-cell and the single-cell studies.
Further, to ensure that the current produced during water-splitting reaction originated only from the OER reaction, continuous water electrolysis was performed at a fixed potential of 1.7 V for 30 minutes. The generated O2 gas during electrolysis was measured using the water–gas displacement method and compared with theoretically expected O2 evolution using faradaic efficiency calculation.54 The amount of O2 obtained with water electrolysis matches well with the theoretically estimated O2 values, representing the maximum utilization of all charges for the OER reaction and demonstrating a faradaic efficiency of 98.6% (Fig. S10c, ESI†).
Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated the scalable synthesis of earth abundant electrocatalyst bimetallic NiFe MOFs supported on GNPs, using BTC as an organic linker. NiFe-BTC-GNPs exhibits small η = 220 mV to achieve j = 10 mA cm−2 (η = 180 mV for j = 20 mA cm−2 on NF), along with a low Tafel slope of 51 mV dec−1. The AAEMWE fabricated with the NiFe-BTC-GNPs MOF shows high j = 540 mA cm−2 at applied cell voltage 1.85 V in ultra-pure water, outperforming the state-of-the-art OER catalyst IrO2. A breakthrough strategy in MEA fabrication by extending the electrical contact with an aqueous electrolyte, which creates an OH− transport pathway to regenerate the original conductivity, demonstrates a long-term stability of 1000 h on continuous electrolysis for practical applications. This AAEMWE works well when integrated with commercial photovoltaics for direct solar-to-hydrogen conversion as a cost-effective and clean strategy for solar energy as a renewable fuel.
Experimental
Materials
Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (98%, Sigma Aldrich), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (≥98%, Sigma Aldrich), trimesic acid (95%, Sigma Aldrich), GNPs (99.5%, Sigma Aldrich), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; ≥99.8%, Alfa Aesar), ethanol (99.9%), dichloromethane (Alfa Aesar) and Millipore water were used in the synthesis of the MOF composite. All these chemicals were used in the experimental studies without any purification. Toray Carbon Paper TGP-H-60 was procured from Alfa Aesar. NF (99.99%) was purchased from MTI Corporation. The concentrator triple junction solar cell (GaInP/GaAs/Ge, efficiency: 40%) was purchased from Shanghai Fullsuns Energy Technology Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China.
Synthesis of NiFe-BTC-GNPs MOF composite
NiFe-BTC-GNPs MOF was prepared according to the previous report of Kumaraguru et al.64 Typically, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (2.33 g, 8.01 mmol), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.3 g, 0.74 mmol) and trimesic acid (1 g, 4.75 mmol) were dissolved in 200 mL of 1:1:1 ratio of H2O:DMF:EtOH mixture. Graphene (0.37 g, 10 wt%) powder was sonicated well for 1 hour in 250 mL of the same solvent, and then both graphene suspension and precursor solution were mixed and placed in an oil bath. The reaction mixture was maintained at 85 °C for 24 h with continuous stirring. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting suspension was filtered, washed repeatedly with DMF, and then immersed in 200 mL of dichloromethane overnight. Subsequently, the mixture was filtered, washed, and immersed in dichloromethane again overnight. Then, the precipitate was filtered and dried at 65 °C for 18 h under vacuum. Finally, the dried product was ground well and stored in a glass vial for further use.
Synthesis of NiFe-BTC-MOF
NiFe-BTC-MOF was also prepared using the same procedure but without adding GNPs during the synthesis process.
Synthesis of NiFeLDH catalyst
NiFeLDH on NF was synthesized by the electrodeposition method reported in the literature.65
Synthesis of MoNi4/MoO2 cuboids on NF electrodes
NiMoO4 cuboids on NF were synthesized by the hydrothermal method reported in the literature.66 The catalyst loading weight of the formed MoNi4/MoO2 nanoparticles on the NF was ∼42.3 mg cm−2.
Physicochemical characterization
PXRD analyses were carried out using an X-ray diffractometer (model D8 Advance, Bucker) with a Cu-Kα1 X-ray (λ = 0.15418 Å) source. FTIR measurements of the catalysts were conducted using a Bruker-Tensor 27 series spectrophotometer. Raman measurements were performed using a Senterra Raman Scope system with 532 nm wavelength incident laser light and 20 mW power. The chemical composition of the catalyst was investigated by using XPS (K-alpha, Thermosphere). The surface morphologies of the catalysts were analyzed by HRTEM (JEM-2100F, JEOL) and cold FESEM. HRTEM was performed with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV, and STEM-EDS images were obtained using a JEM-2100F with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Elemental analysis was performed with an Elementar vario EL III, Germany. The quantity of metal in MOF was analyzed with a HORIBA XGT-5200 energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence microscope. To determine the weight percentages of elements in the catalyst, ICP-MS (PerkinElmer, ELAN DRC-II) and EA (Flash 2000, Thermo Fisher) were used. The electrical conductivity of the MOF samples was measured with a CMT2000N four-point probing system. The pH analysis of the electrolyte was carried out using a Thermo Scientific pH meter (model: ORION STAR A211). Contact angle measurements were carried out using a Phoenix 300 system to measure the surface wettability of the electrodes.
Working electrode preparation
First, to prepare the catalyst ink, 5 mg of the catalyst powder was dispersed in a mixture of 60 μL AAEM solution, 700 μL of 2-propanol and 240 μL deionized water. After 120 minutes of sonication, the solution became homogeneous, and from the resultant catalyst ink, 25 μL was drop-cast onto a pre-treated CFP and dried at 60 °C. The typical catalyst loading was 0.5 mg cm−2. For single-cell studies, NF was used as a working electrode to avoid carbon oxidation at higher operating potentials. Here the catalyst loading was maintained to be 2.5 mg cm−2.
Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical measurements were carried out at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C) in 1 M KOH (pH 13.6) electrolyte using a standard three-electrode system, connected with a VMP3 multi-channel potentiostat (Bio-Logic Science). CFP, NF, and glassy carbon electrodes were used as working electrodes. A Pt foil (2 cm × 2 cm) and mercury-mercuric oxide (Hg/HgO, 1 M NaOH) electrode were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All potentials were measured with respect to mercury-mercuric oxide reference electrode and converted to the RHE scale, using the following Nernst equation: ERHE = EHg/HgO + EOHg/HgO + (0.059 × pH)(1)All electrochemical experiments were performed in the O2-saturated condition to ensure the O2/H2O equilibrium at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Prior to the measurements, working electrodes were pre-activated by CV at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. LSV was conducted at scan rates of 1 and 5 mV s−1. Cyclic stability was evaluated between 1.1 and 1.6 V vs. RHE potentials at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The durability of the catalyst was evaluated by chronopotentiometry measurements at j = 10 mA cm−2. The Nyquist plots for the samples were measured in the frequency range 10 kHz to 10 mHz at different potentials, with an AC voltage amplitude of 10 mV. EIS spectrum was analyzed and fitted using z-fit (EC-LAB) software.
Gas chromatography analysis
Water electrolysis products were analyzed by gas chromatography (6500 GC, YL Instrument) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.
iR-compensation
Applied potentials were corrected for series resistance (Rs) using the high-frequency Nyquist plot obtained by the EIS technique: Ecorrected = Emeasured − EiRS(2)
Electrochemical active surface area
To estimate the active surface area of the electrocatalysts, double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was considered in the non-faradaic region (1.05–1.15 V vs. RHE) of CVs recorded at different scan rates of 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mV s−1. Then, plotting the double-layer charging current at 1.1 V vs. scan rate yields a linear slope, which is equivalent to twice the value of Cdl. ECSA was obtained by dividing Cdl by the specific capacitance of electrode material.44 Generally, the specific capacitance for flat surface electrodes is 0.04 mF cm−2. (3)
Mass activity (jm, A g−1)

 

(4)where m = catalyst loading (g), jgeo = geometrical current density (A cm−2) at 1.53 V vs. RHE.
Turn-over frequency
The TOF (lower bound) of the MOF samples was calculated based on the surface concentration of the active sites in the catalyst material reported in the literature:43 (5)where J = current density (A cm−2), NA = Avogadro number (6.023 × 1023), F = Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1), Γ = surface concentration of active sites or number of participating atoms in the catalyst material.
Rotating ring-disk electrode measurements
An RRDE configuration comprised of a glassy carbon disk electrode (Fig. S4a, ESI†) and a platinum ring electrode (Pine Research Instrumentation, USA) was used to calculate the Faraday efficiency and electron transfer number. The electron transfer number (N) can be calculated from the disk current (Id) and ring current (Ir) of the RRDE: (6)where Id = disk current, Ir = ring current, Nc = ring collection efficiency of RRDE (0.37).
For the faradaic efficiency measurement, the disk current (Id) was set to 0.200 mA for continuous O2 evolution, and the ring potential was set to 0.4 V vs. RHE to determine the faradaic efficiency (ε) in N2-saturated 1 M aqueous KOH solution.16,27 The faradaic efficiency (ε) was calculated by the following equation: (7)For faradaic efficiency measurements and calculations, we ensured that the produced current originated only from the OER. Continuous water electrolysis was carried out at a fixed potential of 1.7 V for 30 min. O2 produced during electrolysis was measured using the water–gas displacement method and compared with theoretically expected O2 evolution.
To calculate the faradaic efficiency, first, we obtained the total charge (Q) passed through the system using current–time profile at regular time intervals by adopting the equation Q = I (A) × T (s). In order to evaluate the theoretical O2 production, the total charge (Q) was divided by 4F. Finally, the faradaic efficiency was calculated using Faraday's law equation: (8)where n = number of electrons involved in the reaction for OER (n = 4) and HER (n = 2), F = Faraday's constant (96485.33 A s mol−1), m = moles of O2 produced.
Single-cell fabrication and analysis

1. PEM electrolyzer fabrication. 
Pre-treatment of Nafion (117) membrane. 
First, a Nafion membrane was treated with nearly boiling (≈80 °C) 3% H2O2 for 1 hour. Then, the membrane was immersed in nearly boiling (≈80 °C) deionized water for 2 hours. Finally, the membrane was treated with nearly boiling (≈80 °C) 0.5 M H2SO4 and subsequently rinsed with ultra-pure water. After the pretreatment the membrane was stored in deionized water.
Fabrication of MEA – catalysts coated on the membrane method. 
To fabricate MEA, the pre-treated membrane was sandwiched between anode and cathode electrodes. For anode and cathode, commercial IrO2 (2.5 mg cm−2) and Pt catalysts were utilized respectively and hot pressed (5 MPa) at 120 °C for 2–3 min. Then, the MEA was mounted into home-made electrolyzer hardware with a 2 cm2 Ti-water flow field and a pair of Pt-coated titanium mesh as both anode and cathode gas diffusion layer. Finally, a stainless steel end plate and silicone gasket were used for mechanical support (Fig. S8a, ESI†). The active area of the single cell is 2 cm × 2 cm.


2. AAEMWE fabrication. 
FAA-3-PK-130 membrane pre-treatment. 
The bromide form of an AAEM (FAA-3-PK-130, Fumatech) was purchased from fuel cell store, USA. Prior to usage, the membrane was immersed in an aqueous solution of 0.5 M KOH for 24 h at 20–30 °C, and then immersed in DI water for 1 h.
Fabrication of MEA – catalysts coated on the substrate method. 
To fabricate the MEA, the pre-treated membrane was sandwiched between anode and cathode electrodes. For anode and cathode, the as-synthesized NiFe-BTC-GNPs and NiMO4/MoO2 catalysts were utilized respectively and hot pressed (5 MPa) at 40 °C for 2–3 min. Then, the MEA was mounted into home-made electrolyzer hardware.

Additional –OH transport pathway
Only 5–8 mL of 0.1 M aqueous KOH solution in a 10 mL beaker was used as electrolyte to make electrical contact with the MEA. Compared to the electrolyte used for electrolysis (3–4 L), this quantity is negligible and has no significant effect on electrolyte pH in long-term electrolysis. Further, the setup was completely sealed with parafilm to avoid atmospheric CO2 contamination.
Electrochemical characterization of AAEMWE
All electrochemical experiments were performed using ultra-pure water (3–4 L) as an electrolyte at 25–70 ± 1 °C under ambient pressure. The electrolyte was fed into the cathode side and recirculated with a water circulator pump. Stability studies were performed at different temperatures (25, 50 and 70 °C), and the whole set-up was periodically disturbed for EIS measurements. For comparison, a noble metal oxide-based AAEMWE (anode: IrO2, cathode: 20% Pt/C) was also fabricated and tested under similar conditions.
Computational method
Spin-polarized calculations were conducted using the Vienna ab initio simulation package67 with projected augmented wave functional.68,69 Geometries were optimized using the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE)70 exchange–correlation potential and Hubbard-U correction71 with Ueff(Fe) = 3.5 eV72 (PBE+U). Then energies including Tkatchenko–Scheffler dispersion correction73 was made on the PBE+U optimized geometries. For structure optimization, a 2 × 2 k-grid was used to sample the first Brillouin zone and the cut-off energy was set to 500 eV. Self-consistent field calculations were used to optimize electronic and ionic steps until the energy difference between two successive steps becomes 0.01 meV and the force constant on each ion reaches 0.02 eV Å−1. Theoretical overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction was calculated using the method of Rossmeisl et al.74

Broader context
Successful commercialization of the splitting of water into hydrogen necessitates high-efficiency and low-cost oxygen electrodes that oxidize water at the near thermodynamic barrier (1.23 eV) with outstanding durability. Here, we report a major advancement in the membrane electrode assembly fabrication method to develop a high-stability alkaline anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AAEMWE) for practical H2 production using metal organic framework (MOF)-derived electrocatalysts. A graphene nanoplatelets-supported NiFe-BTC MOF achieves a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 220 mV on a carbon-fiber paper electrode (180 mV on nickel foam for 20 mA cm−2) with long-term durability of >1000 h in continuous electrolysis, the best OER performance reported so far for MOF-based electrocatalysts in alkaline solution. Remarkably, it exhibits a record current density of 540 mA cm−2 at 1.85 V at 70 °C in AAEMWE. Also, it effectively converts solar energy to H2 without external bias when combined with commercial photovoltaics, demonstrating the feasibility of our system for energy and environmental applications. Overall, our findings not only highlight the design of an efficient oxygen-evolving catalyst but also provide a new route to achieve high-stability AAEMWE for industrial H2 production.
