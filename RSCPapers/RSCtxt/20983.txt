These SQs can be classified into two families: SQs with two carboxylic groups in the side indole groups (symmetrical SQs) and with only one carboxylic group (asymmetrical SQs). Steady-state absorption and fluorescence techniques show narrow absorption and emission bands, with a small Stokes shift (about 300 cm−1). The femtosecond transient absorption spectra give a very short (∼100 fs) dynamics (assigned to IVR) and the associated spectra show two excited species assigned to two stereoisomers. A trans–cisphotoisomerization occurs in a very fast time through a conical intersection. Pico-to-nanosecond emission experiments also reveal the presence of two fluorescing trans stereoisomers whose lifetimes show similar sensitivities to the nature of solvent. For example, lifetimes of 1.72, 0.46 and 0.29 ns were determined for the trans photoisomer of the SQ 41 in triacetin, dichloromethane and acetonitrile, respectively, reflecting the short decay of the S1 state in highly polar and low viscous solvents. Flash photolysis experiments gave the transient absorption signals of the cis photoisomer that is formed after the twisting process at S1. The cis-to-transphotoisomerization at the ground state happens in the μs time scale (1–4 μs), and it depends on the H-bonding ability and viscosity of the solvent. Thus, combining fs–ns and ns–μs experiments suggests that in the conical intersection region, only a small fraction of the twisted trans isomers are converted to the cis ones in the excited states. These results bring detailed and global insight into the large time window photodynamics of this family of SQs in solution.
1. Introduction

Squaraines (SQs) constitute a class of dyes bearing donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) molecular framework1 which exhibit sharp and intense absorption with very high molar extinction coefficient (>200000 M−1 cm−1)2 and fluorescence whose wavelength can be tailored from visible to infrared region depending on the judicious selection of suitable donor moieties.3 In solution, SQ dyes exhibit a high tendency to form J-aggregates that give red-shifted absorption bands (as compared to monomer absorption) or H-aggregates that give blue-shifted absorption bands depending on the structure of the SQs under investigation.4 In the recent years, SQs have been employed as sensitizers in electrography,5 optical data storage,6 non-linear optics,7 photodynamic therapy8 and as fluorescent probes in biolabeling applications.9 Moreover, they have been proposed as materials for solar cell developments10 because they are capable of extending the photoresponse of large band gap semiconductors such as TiO2. Reports of highly efficient photosensitization by a SQ dye (IPCE 85% and power conversion efficiency 4.5%) geared the development of novel SQs for near infrared sensitization towards panchromatic sensitization of dye-sensitized solar cells.11
The molecular structure of the SQs comprises a large variety of donor groups in the D–A–D configuration. In this respect, the simplest aniline donor group can be replaced by more sophisticated electron donating groups, as the quinoxaline,12 triphenylamines,13benzothiazole4a,14 or indole15 moieties and their respective derivates.16 This large pattern of substitutions is responsible for the rich absorption and emission spectra of the different SQs, but it also introduces specific deactivation channels related to the nature of the side group. Another relevant structural feature of the SQs is the symmetry of the molecule, that is, equal or distinct donor groups.17 This characteristic affects strongly not only the photophysics of the molecule but the potential applications of the SQ, as in the vectorial injection of electrons in dye-sensitized solar cells.18

Indole-based SQs have been extensively studied in the last few years in terms of a good deal of publications with respect to the synthesis and absorption data of these compounds in the literature.19 The very high photostability of the indole-based SQs makes them perfect candidates for multiple applications, for example in labeling proteins20 or as photosensitizers.11,21 There are also a few good reports on the photophysical behavior of these cyanine-type SQs, which base the dynamics in the excited state on the cyanine nature of the backbone.22 However, a complete photophysical investigation regarding all the time-resolved techniques (absorption and emission) in the long time scale (from fs to ms) is still required. Moreover, substitution at the N-position of the indole ring may result in modification of the deactivation rate constants, which can help to unravel the deactivation mechanism.
In this work, we report on the photophysics of a set of seven indole-based SQs (symmetrical and asymmetrical) in solution. We used a combination of steady-state and time-resolved techniques, with the aim of a better understanding of their excited state properties. The fluorescence lifetimes in solvents of different polarity and viscosity indicate that twisting and intramolecular charge transfer processes are the main non-radiative deactivation channels of their S1 states. This is corroborated by the nanosecond flash photolysis experiments, in which the transient features for the cis photoisomer are detected. We also focused on the short time scale behavior using the femtosecond transient absorption technique. The results show a very fast component (∼70 fs) and a slightly narrowing of the transient spectra. This behavior is interpreted as a signature of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR). Our results give a deep insight into the fs-to-ms photodynamics of SQ molecules and provide a relationship between their structural properties and photophysics.
2. Experimental
The seven studied SQ molecules, whose general structures are shown (Fig. 1), were synthesized as described elsewhere.15,16aDichloromethane (DCM), methanol (MeOH) and acetonitrile (ACN), spectroscopic grade (>99.5%), and triacetin (TAC) (>+99%) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich were used as received.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structure of the seven studied SQ compounds. 

UV-visible steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectra were measured with JASCO V-670 and FluoroMax-4 (Jobin-Yvone) spectrophotometers, respectively. The ps–ns fluorescence lifetimes were measured using a time-correlated single-photon counting system (TCSPC).23 The sample was excited by a 40-ps pulsed diode laser centred at 635 nm (<5 mW, 40 MHz repetition rate) and the instrument response function (IRF) was ∼70 ps. The experimental decays were magic-angle recorded, and fitted using the FLUOFIT package. The time-dependent anisotropy was constructed using the expression r(t) = (I∥ − GI⊥)/(I∥+2GI⊥), where G is the ratio between the fluorescence intensity at parallel (I∥) and perpendicular (I⊥) polarizations of the emission with respect to the excitation beam. The value of G was measured at a gating window in which the fluorescence is almost completely depolarized (tail matching technique). The quality of the fits was checked by examining the residual distribution and the χ2 value.
Femtosecond (fs) transient UV–visible absorption spectra were measured using a two-channel detection system described previously.24 It consists of a Ti:sapphire oscillator (TISSA 50, CDP Systems) pumped by a 5 W diode laser (Verdi 5, Coherent). The seed pulse (30 fs, 450 mW at 86 MHz) centred at 800 nm wavelength is directed to an amplifier (Legend-USP, Coherent). The amplified fundamental (50 fs, 1 W at 1 kHz) is directed through optical parametric amplifier for wavelength conversion (CDP Systems) to a femtosecond-transient absorption spectrometer (CDP Systems), where it is split into two beams. The first one is frequency-doubled to give 630–670 nm for excitation of the sample. The remaining fundamental beam goes through a delay line and is focused on a rotating 3 mm thick CaF2 plate to generate the white light continuum. The produced white light is split into two parts to form probe and reference beams, which are directed to the cell, where the probe and the pump beams are overlapped. The sample was placed in 0.8 or 2-mm thick rotating cell. The polarization of the pump is set to magic angle with respect to the probe. The transmitted light is directed to a spectrograph and collected by a pair of photodiode arrays.
The UV-visible ns–s flash photolysis setup consists of an LKS.60 laser flash photolysis spectrometer (Applied Photophysics), Vibrant (HE) 355 II laser (Opotek) as a pump pulse source (5 ns time duration) and a 150 W xenon arc lamp as a probe. The signal from OPO (355 nm pumped by Q-switched Nd:YAG laser, Brilliant, Quantel) at a range of wavelengths between 590 and 680 nm was used for the sample excitation. The probing light source was a 150 W xenon arc lamp. The light of the probe transmitted through a 1 cm sample quartz cuvette was dispersed by a monochromator and detected by a photomultiplier coupled to a digital oscilloscope (Agilent Infiniium DS08064A, 600 MHz, 4 GSa s−1). The pump pulse energy (9 mJ/pulse) was attenuated up to 3 mJ/pulse by the pair of half-waveplates and a polarizer. The kinetics were recorded in the spectral range from 550–750 nm every 10 nm and the time-resolved absorption spectra were constructed from the kinetic traces fitted by a global analysis program (PC ProK, Applied Photophysics). The quality of the fits was checked by examining the residual distribution and the χ2 value. All the experiments were done at 293 K.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Steady-state observation and time-resolved picosecond fluorescence
The studied SQ compounds are composed of a central squaric acid moiety and two side-ring substituted carboxyindoles (Fig. 1). Here, the family of asymmetrical SQs refers to those with only one carboxylic group in one of the indole rings (SQ 41 and Me–SQ 41). The other family has alkyl substituents at the N-position of the indole ring. SQ 2 is taken as the reference, having ethyl groups at the two N-positions. The influence of the length of the alkyl chain is considered in SQ 4, which has two octyl chains. The effect of trifluomethyl groups at the end of the propyl chain is evaluated in SQ 26. These last three SQs correspond to the family of symmetrical SQs. Finally, methylation of the carboxylic group in the asymmetrical SQ 41 and in the symmetrical SQ 26 allows us to assess the importance of the polar carboxylic group.

Fig. 2A exhibits UV–visible absorption spectra of the seven SQs in ACN solutions. The main features are narrow absorption peaks centered on 645 nm as well as an additional shoulder around 600 nm. The main peak is known to be caused by a π → π* transition, while the blue-side shoulder was previously interpreted as a vibronic band.22a Two characteristics define the HOMO–LUMO gap in SQ molecules: the extension of the π-electron delocalization, and the electron donating properties of the side groups.25Trifluoromethyl groups do not exert a strong impact on the spectral peak since similar SQs without trifluoromethyl groups exhibit the same peak.26 The fact that the trifluoromethyl groups are located at the end of a propyl chain prevents its strong electron acceptor effect. On the other hand, the sp3carbon atom in the indole moiety diminishes the π-conjugation in the main backbone. Another important physicochemical aspect of the SQs’ behavior is their high tendency to form aggregates, even in solution.4 However, under the experimental conditions used here in the steady-state and ps–ns experiments, we observed no indication of aggregates formation (Fig. S1 in the Supporting Information (ESI),† [SQ] from 10−5 to 2 × 10−8 M). Fig. 2B shows the steady-state emission spectra of the used SQs in ACN solutions, and are excitation-wavelength independent (580–640 nm). The characteristic small Stokes shift of the SQ emission is also noticed here at 300 cm−1.1–3 Similar absorption and emission spectra and small Stokes shift are indicative of very comparable molecular configurations of the dye in the ground and excited states.

We performed ps–ns emission experiments in four solvents upon excitation at 635 nm, and observed at different wavelengths. Table 1 summarizes the lifetimes and amplitudes for SQ 41 in different solvents extracted from biexponential fits of the experimental data. We observed no concentration effects (10−7–10−5 M) on the emission decays, excluding the contribution of aggregates in the signal. For SQ 41 in ACN, for example, the shortest component (τ1 = 70 ps) has a minor contribution (8%). The longest one gives τ2 = 290 ps. In a previous report on a similar SQ, but with the two methyl groups at the N-position,22a the minor component was also found in polar solvents; however, no clear explanation of its origin was given. The presence of the carboxylic group in the molecule might produce H-bonding interactions with the solvent, which could be responsible for one of the relaxation components. To investigate this possibility, we have measured the emission lifetime of the asymmetrical methylated SQ, Me–SQ 41, in ACN. Again, two components were necessary to accurately fit the experimental data (τ1 = 190 ps and τ2 = 540 ps in ACN), which clearly demonstrates that the H-bonding interaction of the OH group of SQ with the solvent does not account for the presence of one of the lifetimes in the SQs with the carboxylic groups. However, we noticed the large increase in the lifetime values upon esterification of SQ 41. The dependence of the emission lifetimes with solvent polarity and viscosity (Table 1) is identical for both components, which suggests similar deactivation pathways for the excited state of both species. Moreover, we find no wavelength dependence of the relative amplitudes observed in the whole emission wavelength range, indicating similar emission spectra of both species, and therefore no significant changes in the molecular structure upon electronic excitation. We ascribe these components to two stereoisomers with a different conformation in the ground state. It is possible that a free rotation through the single C–C bond next to the squaric ring leads to the two different stereoisomers. The difference in lifetimes could originate from the ease with which each stereoisomer is deactivated through a determined relaxation process, most probably involving twisting motion around this bond or the CC one.

The necessity of two components for an accurate fit is not exclusive of the asymmetrical SQs, SQ 41 and Me–SQ 41 (Table 1). The family of the symmetrical SQs in ACN also requires a fast component with lifetimes of 210, 210, 170, 100 and 180 ps for SQ 2, SQ 4, SQ 26, Me–SQ 26 and 2Me–SQ 26, respectively. Table 2 collects these values together with the fractional intensities (45, 17, 17, 4, 25% for SQ 2, SQ 4, SQ 26, Me–SQ 26, 2Me–SQ 26, respectively). Opposite to the tendency of these values is the fractional intensity behavior of the fast component of Me–SQ 41, which becomes the largest one (82% in ACN). According to our previous suggestion, the stereoisomer with a stronger quenching is the most populated in the Me–SQ 41. Finally, a very interesting result comes from the analysis of the emission lifetimes in MeOH, a polar and H-bonding solvent (Table 3). In this solvent, the emission decays of the symmetrical SQs (SQ 2, SQ 4 and SQ 26) are well fitted using only one exponential component. We conclude that the ability to form H-bonds between SQs molecules through their two carboxylic groups and MeOH molecules (in comparison to the SQs with only one carboxylic group) prevents certain flexibility in the molecular framework, remaining only one predominant stereoisomer in these symmetrical SQs in MeOH.

Now, if we compare the emission lifetime of SQ 41 in four solvents of different polarity and viscosity, we observe similar values (0.29 and 0.31 ns) for solvents of comparable polarities and viscosities, ACN and MeOH, respectively (Table 1). However, comparison of emission lifetimes in ACN and DCM solution shows a much longer lifetime in the less polar solvent (DCM), τ = 0.46 ns, compared to that in ACN, τ = 0.29 ns. Therefore, the polarity of the solvent favors the shortening of the emission lifetimes, which suggests the involvement of a non-radiative channel sensitive to the electronic redistribution in the excited SQ. If we use the reaction dielectric field factor (f(ε,n) = [(ε − 1)/(ε + 2)] − [(n2 − 1)/(n2 + 2)], where ε and n are the dielectric constant and the refractive index of the solvent, respectively) to analyze the change in emission lifetime, we obtained a very poor correlation factor, R ∼ 0.3, indicating that an additional factor influences the shortening of the lifetime. On the other hand, we have also measured the lifetime in a solvent with a notably higher value of viscosity, triacetin (TAC, η293 ∼ 20 cP). Comparing the emission lifetime in TAC, τ = 1.7 ns, with that in DCM (a solvent of similar polarity but much lower value of viscosity, η293 ∼ 0.44 cP) we observe a markedly longer emission lifetime in the more viscous solvent. Therefore, higher viscosity of the solvent elongates the emission lifetimes. Thus, the observed shortening of the emission lifetime in highly polar and lowly viscous solvents is in excellent agreement with the mechanism of SQ fluorescence quenching proposed earlier,22 as the non-radiative decay channel connected to a twisting relaxation and subsequent intramolecular charge transfer process (Scheme 1). The well-known extremely low quantum yield of intersystem crossing (ISC) in SQ molecules allows us to rule out this process as a possible efficient deactivation channel of the S1 state.28
 Scheme 1  Sketch of the photophysical processes involved in the deactivation of the studied SQs. The involved energies are not in scale. 
Interestingly, the fluorescence lifetimes of SQ 41 in ACN differ from those of the other SQs (Table 2). In particular, the lifetime turns out to be about 2 times shorter than that of the other SQs, which points out a much faster non-radiative twisting process in the former. The absence of one of the two carboxylic groups in SQ 41 together with the polar character of this group with respect to that of the methylated ester (Me–SQ 41) seems to determine its dynamics. Indeed, the asymmetrical SQ 41 presents already a strong charge separation character in the singlet excited state since the dipole moments do not vanish, as in the symmetrical SQs. The non-radiative channel at S1 must involve an energy barrier to cross to the non-radiative state. This energy barrier, which corresponds to a transition state in SQ 41, should be lower since polar solvents stabilize this state better and then the activation energy for the twisting process decreases. In other words, the twisting relaxation is favored in SQ 41 since the twisting mechanism does not alter the charge redistribution as much as it does in symmetrical SQs. Thus, in SQ 41, the initial and final electronic wave functions resemble each other in a much closer way than in the symmetrical SQs, which makes the rate constant for the twisting relaxation to be larger than in symmetrical ones.
In addition to that, we performed picosecond anisotropy, (r(t)), measurements to get information on the rotational relaxation time, ϕ, which depends on the volume of the emitting molecule and therefore gives information on possible aggregation. r(t) decay of the used SQs in ACN fits to a single-exponential function giving ϕaverage = 125 ps upon excitation at 635 nm (Fig. S2†). Modelling the SQs as an oblate ellipsoid, we calculated rotational relaxation times of approximately 184 and 44 ps, under stick- and slip-boundary condition limits.27 This result agrees with the existence of a monomer in solution, since modelling diverse types of aggregates produces much longer times, for example, 1.7 and 1.3 ns under stick- and slip-boundary condition limits for a ladder-type aggregate with 5 molecules of SQ 26.
To conclude this section, all the studied SQ molecules in solution are present as monomers with the typical features of these type of compounds, namely, emission bands are mirror images of the absorption peak, small Stokes shift and no triplet state formation. Study of the variation of the emission lifetimes of S1 with solvents of different polarity and viscosity shows that the deactivation process that competes with the radiative emission one is a twisting of the CC double bond closer to the central ring in parallel with a fast intramolecular charge transfer.
3.2 Femtosecond transient absorption measurement
To get a better insight into the deactivation processes following the excitation of the SQs, we carried out femtosecond (fs) pump–probe UV-visible transient absorption experiments. The fs experiments were carried out in MeOH, ACN and DCM and upon excitation at 640 nm, close to the maximum of the absorption peak. The concentration was approximately 4 × 10−6 M, giving an optical density ≈ 0.2 in a 2-mm sample cell.

Fig. 3A shows the visible transient absorption spectra (in the 425–615 nm range) recorded at 1 ps time delay between the pump and the probe for the studied SQs in ACN. A transient absorption spectrum in a larger spectral scale, until 800 nm, for SQ 41 in ACN is shown in Fig. S3.† The spectra exhibit a common transient feature peaking around 525 nm, and a bleaching signal in the red part of the spectrum, around 600 nm. Note that the excitation wavelength is 640 nm which prevents probing in that range. We have assigned the positive signals to the singlet excited state absorption of the SQs, S1–Sn transition, and the bleach to the ground-state depopulation. SQ 41 and Me–SQ 41 (asymmetrical SQs) exhibit a broad band centered at 522 nm but with a prominent shoulder at 480 nm. Since the relative ratio between both transient features is approximately constant at any delay time, we have attributed this shoulder to a high-energy vibrational progression within the same electronic transition. In contrast, the symmetrical SQs feature only one transient absorption peak at 510 nm, with an almost perfect Lorentz shape. This behavior is ascribed to the distinct symmetry of the studied SQs. In the asymmetrical SQ 41 and Me–SQ 41, the charge separation character of the excited states is much stronger than in the symmetrical ones, which produces a more intense structural redistribution upon excitation. The latter gives rise to a shift of the potential-energy surfaces of the excited states, which, in turn, makes it possible to observe the higher vibrational transition (1–0 transition). Finally, methylation of the carboxylic groups in the symmetrical SQ 26 gives rise to a blue-shift of the transient signal to 505 nm, which clearly reflects the influence of the carboxylic group in the energy levels of the excited states.
 Fig. 3  (A) Normalized femtosecond transient absorption spectra of the seven SQs in ACN solvent at 1 ps after the laser pump pulse. (B) Time profiles of the signals probed near to the maximum of transient absorption band. The solid curves are from the best fits of the experimental data. Raman peak of the ACN solvent is shown. 
Moreover, Fig. 3B exhibits the corresponding transient absorption signals for the first 750 fs at the selected wavelength of observation near to the absorption maximum of each compound. The Raman peak of the solvent defines the instrumental response function (IRF) of the instrument, and in our case it is 100 fs. The best fit of the transients (Fig. 3) needs a 70 fs rising component, in addition to the decaying one. This rise looks closely similar (70 ± 20 fs) for the different studied samples in ACN. This result indicates that the mechanism involved in this fast process does not depend on the symmetry of the SQ or the nature of the side chains.

Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the transient absorption behavior of SQ 41 and SQ 4 as an example of the asymmetrical and symmetrical ones, respectively, in three different solvents. The spectra in DCM are quite similar to those in ACN, with the two peaks corresponding to both vibrational states for SQ 41 and only one peak in the case of the SQ 4. We also observed a change in the transient absorption maximum, from 522 to 530 nm for SQ 41 and from 514 to 521 for SQ 4, in ACN and DCM, respectively. However, in MeOH, the transient absorption spectrum of SQ 41 features a change in the relative ratio between the two peaks (see Fig. 4A). This indicates that the stabilization of the excited states in MeOH is different (the possibility of involving intermolecular H-bonds), and that the high-energy vibrational transition (488 nm) has a stronger extinction coefficient than the low-energy transition (530 nm). For SQ 4 in MeOH a 16 nm red-shift of the transient peak (see Fig. 4B) is observed. On the other hand, we found no major changes in the lifetimes for the ultrafast component in different solvents, namely, 80, 60 and 70 fs for SQ 41 in MeOH, ACN and DCM, respectively. This agrees with the assumption of ascribing this component to an IVR which is not sensitive to the solvent nature.

Fig. 5 shows an interesting tendency in the transient kinetics for all these SQs samples in the three solvents: while time profiles at central wavelengths (510–525 nm) exhibit this fast rise of the signal, those at side wavelengths (430–490 nm) feature no rise or even decay of the signal. Normalized time profiles of SQ 2 in ACN present this effect clearly (see Fig. 5), with a crossing between the two kinetics as a consequence of the rise–decay of the two signals. Thus, these two experimental facts give rise to a net narrowing of the transient peaks during the early times of the measurement. This latter effect can be visualized conclusively in Fig. 6, in which five normalized transient absorption spectra of the asymmetrical SQ 41 in ACN are shown. It is possible to observe a decrease in the transient signal with the time around 490 nm; on the contrary, the transient signal at 530 nm increases with the time.

The notably short time scales of this component (∼70 fs) together with the spectral characteristics (narrowing of the peak) and no dependence with the solvent nature suggest an intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR)29 as the process responsible for this fast event. In this process, the energy that is initially coherently deposited in a group of vibrational levels is spread to a larger set of states at an equal total energy under the influence of intramolecular mode couplings.30 The present data allow us to conclude that the first detected state is a non-equilibrium vibrational state belonging to the electronic excited state manifold. This state decays in about 70 fs to the internally equilibrated Boltzmann state. Comparable lifetimes have been previously reported for zinc porphyrin (ZnTPP, 50–90 fs),31 with similar characteristics of spectral behavior, being attributed to this intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution process which corroborates our assignment. Another possible mechanism that might account for this process is the vibrational cooling relaxation32 representing thermal equilibration with the solvent. However, we rule out this process since the time constant for the vibrational cooling for such large molecules are usually much longer than the lifetimes measured in these SQs. Moreover, we found no solvent dependence for this component.
We now examine the transient behavior on a longer time scale (up to 1.7 ns). We focus only on two representative examples of the two families of SQs: SQ 41 as an example of the asymmetrical SQs and SQ 26 as the symmetrical ones. Firstly, a comparison of the transient absorption spectra at different time delays shows no remarkable changes in the shape of the spectra. This means that, within this time window, the singlet excited state of the SQs deactivates directly to the ground state or to any possible intermediate species evolving “instantaneously” to the ground state of the SQs (conical intersection). Thus, the decay of the transient signal (400–550 nm) and the recovery of the ground state absorption (600–615 nm) are fitted by using biexponential functions (Fig. 7). We have found the same time constants when fitting the singlet excited state decay and ground state recovery, demonstrating that both features account for the same photophysical process. Times of 705 and 230 ps for the long-living component from biexponential fits are determined for SQ 26 and SQ 41, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the previously reported lifetimes from the TCSPC experiments (Table 2). Considering the fast component, lifetimes of 117 and 75 ps were estimated from the fits for SQ 26 and SQ 41, respectively. Fig. 8A and B show the decay associated transient spectra of both components. Clearly, the position and shape of the obtained spectra depend on the nature of the SQ, and are in agreement with the biexponential emission decay behavior, reflecting two stereo-conformers of trans isomers. An interesting point to consider from these transients is that almost (95%) of the twisted conformers in the conical intersection region return back to the trans isomers. This observation is based on the fact that the decays and rises (Fig. 7A and B) at the gated wavelengths are almost identical and are done in the nanosecond regime, and on the fact that the cis isomers should be produced in the fs–ps time scale, and no significant absorption (about 5%) is shown in these decays. As we will show later, the lifetime of the cis isomers is in the microsecond time scale.

(B) Associated transient spectra obtained from the global analysis of SQ 26 in ACN solutions. Fast component with 117 ps lifetime (purple circles, ) and slow component with 705 ps lifetime (blue squares, ). 
Summarizing this part, the transient behavior in the short time-scale shows an ultrafast component (∼70 fs) assigned to IVR. In the ps-regime, bi-exponential fits of the decays were needed for all the samples. The shape of the transient absorption spectrum for the singlet excited state of SQs is constant with the time. This is ascribed to a direct deactivation to the ground state or to an intermediate energy level which rapidly decays to the ground state (vide infra). At the conical intersection region, almost 95% of the exited twisted isomers go back to its trans configurations in the ground sate.
3.3. Nano–microsecond flash photolysis measurements
To investigate the behavior of the photoproducts of the twisting process, flash photolysis measurements were carried out for SQ 41 in three different solvents: DCM, ACN and TAC.

Fig. 9A and Fig. S4† show the ns–μs transient absorption spectra of SQ 41 in ACN, DCM and TAC solutions at four different time delays after the laser pulse. The pumping wavelength was fixed at the maximum of the steady-state absorption spectra, 640 nm, and the laser power at 3 mJ/pulse. SQ 41 solutions are prepared with the same absorbance at 640 nm, A = 0.7 (in 1 cm sample cell), to make a quantitative analysis of the signal intensity. At first, the 400–550 nm region is explored to look for a possible remaining signal comparable to those obtained from the fs–ps experiments. No transient signal was observed in this region. Therefore, we conclude that the singlet excited state population completely disappeared in this time scale. However, a positive band is clearly detected at around 650 nm in all solvents with the corresponding bleaching signal matching the absorption spectrum shape and peaking at around 630 nm. Time profiles at the maxima and minima of the transient signals are plotted in Fig. 9B and Fig. S5.† The fits of the experimental data were carried out by using monoexponential functions, obtaining lifetimes of 1.6, 3.0, and 4 μs, for SQ 41 in DCM, ACN and TAC, respectively. Note that the fits of both positive and negative signals give the same time, indicating that they reflect the kinetics of the same species. In this case, the ground state of cis isomers is formed upon relaxation of SQs in S1 through conical intersection and will give the stabilized ground states trans isomers in microsecond times (τbp) and having kbp as rate constants of the back photoisomerization process (Scheme 1). Upon bubbling with both O2 and N2 for 10 min, no detectable changes either in the transient absorption peaks or lifetimes are observable. This result rules out the assignment of the transient signal to a triplet state. In SQs lacking heavy atoms, the low quantum yield for intersystem crossing (ISC) has been already reported in the literature.12b Triplet–triplet energy transfer process was proposed to characterize the triplet excited state of SQs.33

(B) Time profiles of the variation of the absorption (ΔA) of the same sample observed at 650 and 630 nm and best fits of the experimental data giving times of 3 μs for both observed wavelengths. 
In addition to that, we have also performed flash photolysis measurements for some of the other SQs in MeOH solutions in order to investigate whether the ns–μs photodynamics remains unaltered among the different SQs or depends on the used solvent. Fig. S6† shows the transient absorption spectra for SQ 41, SQ 26, SQ 4, SQ 2 and Me–SQ 41 in MeOH. It shows almost no changes in the spectral position and shape. Fig. 10 and Table 3 show the transients and lifetimes obtained at two different wavelengths (positive and negative bands). The shortest time is found for Me–SQ 41 (0.8 μs), which ascribed to a fast back photoisomerization (2.1 μs for SQ 41). This difference suggests that the effect of H-bonding with the solvent plays an important role in this process. On the other hand, the symmetrical SQs (SQ 2, SQ 4 and SQ 26) do not show significant change in these times (3.7, 3 and 4.2 μs, respectively).
 Fig. 10  Microsecond time profiles of the variation in the normalized absorption intensity (ΔA) SQ 41 (A), SQ 26 (B), SQ 4 (C), SQ 2 (D) and Me–SQ 41 (E) in MeOH at 650–660 and 630–640 nm and best fits of the experimental data. Lifetimes of 2.1, 4.2, 3, 3.7 and 0.8 μs were obtained from the fits for SQ 41, SQ 26, SQ 4, SQ 2 and Me–SQ 41, respectively. 
It is worth noting three features that help to assign the new transient band. Firstly, the transient absorption band at 650 nm resembles the ground state absorption, with only 8 nm red-shift of the absorption maximum. Secondly, the transient absorption signals in TAC, a more viscous solvent, are 2–3 times lower than in the other two solvents, DCM and ACN, under the same experimental conditions. Thirdly, longer lifetimes for the transient signal of SQ 41 in TAC are obtained (4 μs vs. 1.6 μs in DCM). Based on these findings, we attribute the transient signal to a cis photoisomer of the SQs that is formed after a twisting process along the CC double bond linking the main squaraine fragment with the rest of the indole parts (Scheme 1). Indeed, a similar transient signal was previously assigned as originating from the transient cis photoisomer,22d as it occurs in cyanine dyes.34 It is worth noting that we excite two different stereo conformers of the trans isomers in the ground state, as it was discussed before. The photodynamics of these two conformers evolve in parallel ways, giving rise to the same twisted states and corresponding trans (95%) and cis (5%) photoisomers.
In summary, we detected a positive transient signal at 650 nm and a bleaching signal matching the steady-state absorption spectrum shape at around 630 nm for all SQs in all solvents in the μs time window. We ascribe these transient signals to the cis photoisomer of the SQs that is formed after the twisting process at S1 which depends on the solvent viscosity and H-bonding interactions.
4. Conclusion
We find that the SQ molecules studied here appear in solution as monomers (narrow absorption band) with all the typical features of this type of squaraines, namely, emission bands are mirror images of the absorption ones, small Stokes shift and no triplet excited state formation. The photophysical processes in these SQs are depicted in Scheme 1. Thus, three major processes participate in the singlet excited state deactivation of the SQs, namely a barrierless internal conversion to the S0 level (k0), fluorescence emission (kem) and twisting process which has a potential energy barrier Eb (knr). Polar solvents produce a decrease in the potential energy barrier, Eb, since the twisting relates to a growing of the dipole moment of the SQs (intramolecular charge transfer). A high viscosity of the solvent precludes the twisting motion. Twisted excited state suffers from a rapid non-radiative deactivation since it is in close proximity to a conical intersection region, giving rise to the cis and trans photoisomers in the ground state. In particular, asymmetrical SQs (SQ 41) present emission lifetimes shorter than those of symmetrical SQs (290 vs. ∼600 ps in ACN). This lifetime shortening is ascribed to the lower energy of the transition state involved in the twisting mechanism, which possesses a higher dipole moment in asymmetrical SQs, and, therefore, is better stabilized by polar solvents, reducing the activation energy of the process. Femtosecond transient absorption experiments were fitted using a biexponential function decay, in full agreement with the emission data, with different amplitude ratios depending on the studied SQs. The decay-associated transient absorption spectra clearly show this specific dependency of their contribution and spectral position on the nature of the SQs. We believe that the presence of two similar stereoisomers in the ground state accounts for these two lifetimes since both components follow the same tendency towards solvent polarity and viscosity. In addition, the fs-experiment shows an ultrafast component (∼70 fs) which is to a large extent independent of the used solvent and of the type of SQs. This component is attributed to IVR. The flash photolysis experiments give the transient absorption spectra and the decay of the formed cis-isomers upon relaxation of the S1 state through internal conversion or conical intersection. The observed times (1.6–4 μs) depend on the solvent viscosity. At the conical intersection region, a very large proportion of the exited twisted isomers go back to their trans configurations in the ground sate. Thus, the fs-to-μs studies of the seven studied SQs presented here bring a detailed and global picture of their photodynamics at both the ground and electronically excited state of their stereoisomers in solution.
