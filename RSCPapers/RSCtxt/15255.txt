    , Accepted 26th April 2019First published on 26th April 2019AbstractPhotoinduced charge and energy transfer are significant photophysical processes controlling the efficiency of photosynthesis and molecular electronics. Here, the influence of solvent polarity and excitation wavelength on the dynamics of excited state relaxation pathways of a push–pull chromophore (PXFCN), where phenoxazine and cyano fluorene acted as a donor and an acceptor, respectively, is investigated in detail by using steady state spectroscopy, nanosecond and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and picosecond emission spectroscopy. In acetonitrile (ACN), the steady state emission spectra of PXFCN exhibited three maxima at around 330, 405 and 620 nm covering the complete continuum range (CIE coordinates of 0.32, 0.40) with an absolute quantum yield of ≈0.12. The aggregation induced emission with an increased quantum yield of ≈0.32 was observed in a tetrahydrofuran and water mixture due to the formation of nano-aggregates. Interestingly the steady state and time resolved emission spectra of PXFCN in ACN obtained upon excitation at different wavelengths revealed the presence of both intramolecular charge and energy transfer processes, whereas in cyclohexane (CHX) the emission originated mainly from the local excited state revealing efficient intramolecular energy transfer. The femtosecond transient absorption spectrum in the polar solvent, ACN, shows that the excited state relaxation pathway is controlled by solvent stabilized twisted intramolecular charge transfer dynamics limiting the formation of the triplet state. However in the case of CHX, the charge transfer state formed upon photoexcitation decayed to the triplet state by geminate charge recombination. The nanosecond transient absorption spectra manifest the dominant feature of the triplet state and the charge transfer state in CHX and ACN, respectively, and their complete dynamics were obtained. Thus based on the transient absorption and emission spectra, it is inferred that the intramolecular charge transfer occurring along with the energy transfer is controlled by the polarity of the solvent through conformational changes leading to a favourable position yielding the charge and energy transfer between the donor and acceptor moieties.
1. Introduction
Understanding the charge and energy transfer processes induced by photoexcitation is an important factor in designing and developing highly efficient molecular systems for various organic optoelectronic devices including organic solar cells,1 organic light-emitting diodes,2 organic field effect transistors,2a,3 fluorescent sensors in biological systems,4 light-harvesting arrays,5 and organic lasers.6 For example in the conversion of solar energy into electricity, singlet excitons generated by photoexcitation migrate to the interfacial region between the donor and the acceptor by energy transfer which is followed by electron transfer (charge separation) to produce photocurrent.7 In organic light emitting devices, light-emitting chromophores are usually dispersed in a wide bandgap host allowing energy transfer from the matrix to the guest molecules.8 In the case of fluorescence sensors used in biological recognition processes, the electron and energy of the photoexcitation is relayed to the acceptor in the donor and acceptor π conjugated system.9 Generally, the rate and efficiency of the charge and energy transfer depend on the chemical structures, solvents and environments and competition between radiative and non-radiative decay pathways.10
Typically photoinduced electron transfer (PET) in a donor–acceptor conjugated molecule leads to the formation of a charge separated state comprising a radical cation in the donor and the radical anion in the acceptor group. The dynamics of the charge transfer (CT) processes are extensively influenced by different stages of solvation and intramolecular relaxation depending on the solvent polarity.11 The occurrence of the CT state normally revealed by the appearance of dual emission (sensitive to the solvent polarity) is explained by different models including planar, pretwisted or partially twisted, twisted, rehybridized, and multifaceted dynamics.12 In the case of excitation energy transfer, it occurs mainly through three different physical pathways including the long range resonance by dipole–dipole induced resonant (Förster) interaction,13 short range through space exchange (Dexter) interaction14 and super exchange bridge-mediated mechanism.15 Remarkably the rate of dipole–dipole induced energy transfer decreases with R−6, and in the case of exchange interaction energy transfer, it decreases as exp(−2R/L), where R and L are the effective orbital radius and fixed donor–acceptor distance, respectively. It is found that the energy transfer in the donor–acceptor cassette systems would occur through bonds and vary with the relative orientation of the two components, and with the structure of the linkers.16
A large number of experimental and theoretical studies have been carried out to understand the underlying mechanism in the intramolecular charge and energy transfer processes in the push–pull chromophore systems.17 In this context, the excited state dynamics of donor and acceptor derivatives with a fluorene unit have received significant attention since the fluorene moiety serves as a stable and rigid π-system and a two-photon absorption material.18 The steady and excited state dynamics of fluorene derivatives having diphenyl amine and 2-benzothiazoyl as the donor and acceptor, respectively, were investigated by changing the polarity of the solvents.19 It was observed that the formation of the solvent stabilized intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state occurred with a time constant of 0.85 to 2.71 ps depending on the polarity of the solvent. Recently the effect of ethyl substitution at the amino group of 2-amino-7-nitrofluorene on the excited relaxation pathway was compared to that of 2-dimethylamino-7-nitrofluorene and the mechanism of formation of the two CT states was assessed by considering the possibility of twisting of either the amino or nitro moiety.20
Here the excited state relaxation pathways and conformational dynamics of the push–pull derivative, PXFCN (Fig. 1), where phenoxazine (PHO) and dimethyl substituted cyanofluorene (DMF) acted as an electron donor and acceptor, respectively, are investigated by changing the polarity of the solvent and excitation wavelengths. The steady state absorption and emission spectra of PXFCN were measured in different solvents by varying the polarity. Interestingly, the steady state emission spectra of PXFCN in ACN exhibited a complete continuum range from 330 to 750 nm with CIE coordinates of 0.32, 0.40 upon excitation at 310 nm. The time resolved absorption and emission spectra of the compound in polar and non-polar solvents revealed that the polarity of the solvent controlled the dynamics of intramolecular charge and energy transfer processes. The understanding of the electronic communication between the donor and acceptor in such molecules would help in designing the chromophores for efficient optoelectronics devices.

2. Experimental section
2.1 General details
The chemicals and reagents used for synthesis were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Merck and TCI. Dry solvents were prepared by following the reported procedures.211H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX 500 MHz spectrometer using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard, and deuterated solvents were used for the measurements. High resolution mass spectra of the compounds were recorded using a Thermo Scientific Exactive-LC-MS system. The solvents used for the spectroscopic measurements were of HPLC grade (Merck) and were used as received.
2.2 Synthesis of 9,9-dimethyl-7-(10H-phenoxazine-10-yl)-9H-fluorene-2-carbonitrile (PXFCN)
The synthetic route and chemical structure of the intermediates and the desired compound PXFCN are shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). All of the starting materials are easily available at low price. The final compound is obtained by reacting 2-bromo-7-cyano-9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluorene with PHO in the presence of a Pd catalyst (tris(dibenzylidineacetone)dipalladium(0)) by a Butchwald Hartwig coupling reaction.22 The yield of the final compound is about 82%. The structure of the compounds is characterized by 1H and 13C NMR and HRMS. The experimental details and spectral data are provided in the ESI.†
2.3 Steady state measurements
Absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV-visible absorption spectrophotometer. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Fluorolog-3 (Horiba) which was equipped with a 450 W Xe arc lamp. The low temperature emission spectra were also measured at 77 K using the same instrument with a liquid nitrogen cell holder. The fluorescence quantum yield in different solvents was determined with the relative method employing Coumarin 153 in different solvents with the same absorbance as that of the sample based on the emission maximum.23 The following equation was used for calculating the quantum yield: (1)where subscripts R and S refer to the reference and sample, respectively. Abs, Area and n are the absorbance at the excitation wavelength, area under the fluorescence spectrum and refractive index of the solvent, respectively. In addition the absolute fluorescence quantum yield is measured in solution by using the integrating sphere (Quanta–φ, Horiba) following a reported procedure.24 Tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum (Alq3) was used as a standard for the solid-state fluorescence quantum yield which was 19 ± 2% consistent with the literature.25 It should be noted that the spectra have to be mapped in the frequency domain for the calculation of quantum yield and determination of change in the dipole moment between the ground and excited state using the Lippert–Mataga function and for comparison of the theoretical spectra with the experimental spectra. Hence we have converted the fluorescence spectra obtained at wavelength F(λ) to wavenumber F(ν) by dividing the factor ν2 by F(λ).
2.4 Time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC)
Time-resolved fluorescence spectra and lifetime decays were measured by using a picosecond single photon counting system (Horiba, DeltaFlex) employing 274, 331 and 378 nm LED as excitation sources and Picosecond photon detection module (PPD-850) as a detector. The time resolution of our TCSPC experimental setup is <180 ps for 378 nm and <1.2 ns for 274 and 331 nm LED sources. The fluorescence time constants are obtained by deconvoluting with the LED profiles. The decay of the fluorescence intensity (I) with time (t) was fitted either by a mono or double-exponential function: (2) (3)where τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes of different species, and A1 and A2 are their respective amplitudes.
2.5 Nanosecond transient absorption spectra
Nanosecond laser flash photolysis experiments were performed by exciting the samples with the third harmonic (355 nm) from an INDI-40-10-HG Quanta Ray Nd:YAG laser and using a kinetic spectrometer (LKS 60, Applied Photophysics). The probing light source was a 150 W pulsed xenon arc lamp. The probe light transmitted through a sample in a 1 cm quartz cuvette was dispersed by a monochromator and detected by a photomultiplier tube coupled to a digital oscilloscope (Agilent Infiniium DSO8064A, 600 MHz, 4 GSa s−1). The probe and laser beams were fixed at right angles to each other. The power of each laser pulse was monitored using a fast silicon photodiode (bypath). Solutions for laser flash photolysis studies were deaerated by purging with argon for at least 20 min before the experiments. The absorbance of the deaerated solution used was 0.2 OD in 1 cm cuvette and the excitation energy used for measuring the nanosecond transient absorption spectra was ∼40 mJ. All the experiments were conducted at room temperature.
2.6 Femtosecond transient absorption measurements
The basic seed laser pulses were obtained from a Ti:sapphire laser (Mai Tai HP, Spectra Physics, USA) pumped by a 14 W frequency doubled Nd:YVO4 (532 nm) laser. It was centered at 800 nm (80 MHz repetition rate) with a pulse width of <110 fs and an average power of 2.5 W. A part of the (25%) fundamental pulsed laser beam was amplified at 1 kHz using a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (Spitfire Ace, Spectra Physics) pumped by the second harmonic (527 nm, 30 W) from an intercavity-doubled, diode-pumped Q switched Nd:YLF laser (Empower-30 Spectra Physics). The amplified laser output with an energy of 4 mJ centered at 800 nm having a pulse width of <120 fs was split (75:25%) into two beams, in which the high energy beam is converted into the desired excitation wavelengths (pump beam: 311, 330 and 385 nm) by coupling it into a TOPAS (Prime, Light Conversion). The pump beam was then passed through a computer-controlled optical chopper and focused on the sample cell. Another part of amplified beam (200 mW) was focused on a 1 mm thick sapphire plate to generate a white light continuum (350–1000 nm), which finally spilt into two for the sample and reference probe beams. The sample is loaded in a cylindrical quartz cell with 0.4 mm optical path length placed in a variable speed rotating holder. After passing through the sample cell, the white light continuum is coupled to a 100 μm optical fiber connected to an imaging spectrometer. The pump–probe spectrophotometer setup was based on an ExciPro spectrometer (CDP Systems Corp., Russia). Typically, the time-resolved absorption spectra were obtained by averaging over 2000 excitation pulses at all spectral delay times. The polarization of the pump pulse was set at the magic angle (54.7°) relative to the probe pulse to recover the isotropic absorption spectrum. The absorbance of the solution used was ∼0.7 OD in 1 mm path length and the excitation energy was ∼2 μJ for all the measurements. The effective time resolution of the ultrafast spectrometer is determined to be about ≤120 fs.
2.7 Computational method
The ground-state geometry was optimized by using density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP hybrid functional and the 6-31G(d) basis set. Geometry optimization of the lowest excited singlet state (S1) was carried out by using TDDFT with the CAM-B3LYP hybrid functional and the same basis set. All calculations were carried out using the GAUSSIAN 09 software package.26
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Steady state photophysical characterization

3.1.1 Photophysical properties in solution. 

Fig. 2 shows the absorption and emission spectra of PXFCN in various solvents with an increase in polarity. The absorption spectra of PXFCN consists of a strong band with a vibrational feature, shoulder and weak band at around 311, 330 and 395 nm respectively. The extinction coefficient of PXFCN was found to be around 41000 M−1 cm−1 at 311 nm. To understand the contribution of the individual chromophores of PXFCN, viz., DMF and PHO to the photophysical properties of PXFCN, the absorption and emission spectra of these compounds were also measured in CHX and ACN and are provided in the ESI† (Fig. S1 and S2). The intense peak at ∼311 nm and shoulder at ∼330 nm in the absorption spectra (Fig. 2) are assigned to the transition corresponding to the subunit of DMF27 and PHO28 respectively. When the polarity of the solvent increased, the absorption maximum at ∼311 nm and shoulder at ∼330 nm did not change significantly whereas the weak absorption at ∼395 nm shifted to the blue region around 375 nm. The weak absorption around 395 nm is attributed to the CT band raised by electronic coupling between individual chromophores. A blue shift upon increasing the solvent polarity could be due to the compound having a lower conjugated degree by readjustment of its geometry by experiencing a finite solvent reaction field. Similar solvent dependence of optical absorption features was also reported for other compounds.29

Interestingly the fluorescence spectra of the compound obtained upon excitation at 385 nm exhibited a significant bathochromic shift with an increase in solvent polarity. For instance, the emission spectra in CHX showed a vibrational feature around 433 nm and in polar ACN, it was broadened and highly red shifted to around 620 nm with an overall Stokes shift of ∼10000 cm−1. The fluorescence excitation spectra were measured at 433 nm for the compound in CHX and at 620 nm for ACN to explore the origin of the emissive states. They are found to be nearly identical to each other and similar to the corresponding absorption spectra (Fig. 3 insets, vide infra). This reflects that the emissive species in both solvents follow the same excitation pathway. Upon photoexcitation, the chromophore relaxes from the local excited state in a non-polar solvent, which could transform into a more polar state through the ICT process by undergoing conformational changes.30 Further to determine the change in the dipole moment between the ground and excited state, the Lippert–Mataga function (eqn (4))31 dealing with the relationship between the Stokes shift and solvent polarity was used. The Stokes shifts were calculated from the absorption and emission maxima provided in Table 1. (4)where h, c, ε and n are the Planck's constant, velocity of light in vacuum, dielectric constant and refractive index of the solvent, respectively. The cavity radius, a, was calculated using eqn (5). (5)where vw is the volume of the van der Waals surface of the molecule, and was obtained using Discovery Studio Visualizer v 2.0 (Accelyrs software Inc.). Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the Lippert–Mataga plot of Stokes shift vs. solvent polarity parameters and the value of μe − μg is found to be around 18.01 D which is comparable to the theoretical value (22.80 D) obtained by geometrical optimization. This reflects the large change in the dipole moment between the ground and excited states due to redistribution of the charge in the excited state yielding more polar characteristic of the S1 state than the ground state. The absolute fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime of PXFCN in different solvents were measured and the results are provided in the Table 1. The radiative and nonradiative rate constants were also calculated from absolute fluorescence quantum yields (Φ) and lifetime (τf) using the following equations and are provided in Table 1. (6)where kr and knr represent the radiative and non-radiative rate constants, respectively. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of PXFCN in the solid state were also measured (Fig. S4, ESI†). The absolute fluorescence quantum yield in the solid state was measured by using an integrating sphere to be around 0.33.24 The fluorescence lifetime has two components as τ1 = 0.70 ns (28.3%) and τ2 = 2.58 ns (71.7%). It is to be noted that the fluorescence quantum yield in the solid state is larger when compared to the neat solvents (∼0.08).

The DFT and TDDFT calculations were performed to determine the optimized structures of the molecules in the ground (S0) as well as in the excited (S1) states. The theoretically optimized values of energy and absorption maxima with the oscillator strength are provided in Table S1, ESI.† It is found that the S1 ← S0 transition is from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Interestingly the HOMO orbitals were concentrated on the PHO moiety and in LUMO, the electronic contribution was concentrated on the DMF moiety (Fig. S5, ESI†). It is supported by the redox potential values of individual moieties and compounds measured using cyclic voltammetry (Table S2, ESI†), where the PHO and DMF have lower oxidation and reduction potential values revealing their capability to act as a donor and an acceptor, respectively. Further, the dipole moments of the S0 and S1 states of PXFCN were theoretically found to be 2.69 and 22.80 D, respectively.
The emission spectra of PXFCN, DMF and PHO in CHX and ACN were measured at low temperature (77 K) achieved by using liquid nitrogen (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). Interestingly in the case of PXFCN, the low temperature fluorescence spectra in both solvents showed only a single broad peak around 500 nm which is red shifted around 70 nm compared to the emission maximum in CHX at room temperature. The broad peak at ∼500 nm is attributed to phosphorescence. Alternatively, the red shift of the fluorescence maximum compared to room temperature may be because the increase in the solvent polarity caused by a more ordered orientation of solvent molecules in the vicinity of solute molecules would increase the interactions between the solvent and solute by lowering the temperature.32 The low temperature emission spectra of DMF and PHO in CHX and ACN showed dual maxima with vibrational features. It is found that there is no significant change in the low temperature emission spectra of DMF and PHO in CHX compared to that of ACN. The low temperature emission spectra of DMF showed peaks at around 330 and 500 nm. In the case of PHO, they appeared at around 374 and 500 nm. The emission that appeared in the blue region for DMF (330 nm) and PHO (374 nm) at low temperature is similar to the emission maximum obtained at room temperature (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). The emission peak at longer wavelength (∼500 nm) for DMF and PHO is attributed to the phosphorescence since it appeared in the red side of the fluorescence band and was observed at low temperature.
In order to understand the effect of excitation energy, the emission spectra of PXFCN in ACN and CHX were measured by varying the excitation wavelengths (Fig. 3). Interestingly, with the increase of the excitation wavelength, PXFCN in ACN showed different spectral features, however in CHX the emission spectra did not change significantly. For excitation at 310 nm, the emission spectra in ACN exhibited three peaks around 330, 405 and 620 nm covering the entire continuum range (CIE coordinates: 0.32, 0.40) having an absolute fluorescence quantum yield of 0.12. With an increase of the excitation wavelength at 330 nm, the spectra showed two peaks at around 405 and 620 nm. On further increasing the excitation wavelength to 385 nm, only a weak broad emission peak around 620 nm was observed. To identify the origin of the emitting species, the fluorescence excitation spectra were measured in ACN by monitoring emission at 330, 405 and 620 nm as shown in the inset of Fig. 3b. The excitation spectra obtained by probing the emission at 620 nm reflects the absorption spectra of PXFCN in ACN (as mentioned earlier), and the excitation spectra obtained at 330 nm and 405 nm are identical to the absorption spectra of DMF and PHO, respectively. Hence the appearance of the emission maximum around 620 nm upon excitation of DMF (311 nm) and PHO (330 nm) moieties reflects the occurrence of an intramolecular energy transfer process from the DMF moiety to the PHO moiety and then a CT absorption band of the compound in a polar solvent, ACN. An overlap of the emission spectra of DMF with the absorption spectra of PHO and the emission spectra of PHO with the absorption spectra (∼385 nm) of PXFCN (Fig. S6, ESI†) also supports the possibility of intramolecular energy transfer. In the case of CHX, the excitation spectra obtained by monitoring the emission at 432 and 460 nm (Fig. 3a inset) did not show any significant differences and similarity to the absorption spectra of PXFCN in CHX (Fig. 2). The observation of identical emission spectra upon excitation at various wavelengths signifies the efficient intramolecular energy transfer in CHX.


3.1.2 Effect of aggregation. 
Here to explore the influence of aggregates on the photophysical properties, the absorption and emission spectra of PXFCN in a THF and water mixture were measured. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the absorption spectra of PXFCN in THF with an increase in the water fraction. It was observed that with the increase of the water fraction up to 70%, there was no significant change in the absorption spectra. Upon further increasing the water fraction, the absorbance of the peak at around 290 nm decreased, the peak at 311 and 395 nm and the shoulder around 330 nm broadened and shifted towards the red region. In the case of the emission spectra, the decrease in the intensity and shifting of the emission maximum (550 nm) to the red region (595 nm) were observed with an increase of the water fraction up to 30% (Fig. 4). Upon further increasing the water concentration (60%), the emission intensity at around 595 nm steadily decreased. Interestingly upon further increasing the water fraction especially to 90%, there was an increase of the emission intensity by two times and the maximum shifted to the blue region around 520 nm when compared to the compound in 100% THF. The plot of F/F0vs. the volume fraction of water in THF is shown in the inset of Fig. 4a. The fluorescence lifetime of PXFCN in a THF and water mixture was measured upon excitation at 378 nm using a laser diode and the fluorescence decay profiles are shown in Fig. S8, ESI.† The lifetime values obtained by analysing the decays with either single or double exponential fits are provided in Table S3, ESI.† It is found that with the increase of the water fraction up to 50%, the lifetime of the compound decreased (0.42 ns) compared to 100% THF solution (9.84 ns). Upon further increasing the water fraction, the amplitude of the long lived components (∼14 ns) was increased. The absolute fluorescence quantum yields of the compound in THF and water mixtures (fw) of 0, 60, 75 and 90% were measured using an integrating sphere and the values were found to be 0.08, 0.001, 0.032 and 0.32, respectively. Further the diameter of the particle size of PXFCN in THF and water mixtures at fw 90% was measured using DLS and found to be around 400 nm (Fig. S9, ESI†).
 Fig. 4  Fluorescence spectra of PXFCN in different THF and water mixtures obtained upon excitation at 377 nm. Insets show a plot of F/F0vs. water fraction (vol%) and the temperature dependent fluorescence spectra of the compound in a water fraction of 90%. 
Overall the quenching of the fluorescence intensity and shifting of the maximum towards the red region with the increase of the water fraction up to 50% could be due to the increase of the solvent polarity. The formation of nano-aggregates with the increase of the water fraction up to 90% is attributed to the increase of the emission intensity along with shifting of the maximum towards the blue region. Similar kinds of observations were reported for many other compounds33 and the enhancement of emission intensity was assigned to aggregation induced emission. The temperature dependent emission spectrum of the compound in THF and water (fw = 10%) mixtures was measured and is given in the inset of Fig. 4c. It exhibited a decrease in the emission intensity and shif towards the red region at 60 °C compared to 20 °C mainly due to the breaking of the aggregates and change in the viscosity with the increase of temperature.
Single crystals of PXFCN were grown from DMF and water mixtures by slow evaporation. The crystals structure was determined by X-ray single-crystal diffraction and the data are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 5 shows the unit cell, molecular arrangement along the b axis and short contacts with neighboring units. The crystal structure comprises of four monomers per unit cell and PXFCN belongs to the monoclinic crystal system. The PHO unit is twisted from the plane of the DMF moiety at an angle of 118.69°. The molecule shows moderate interactions of O···C–H and π···C–H with neighboring molecules. The oxygen of the PHO moiety in the unique molecule has an O ··· C–H (2.703 Å) interaction with the methyl group of the DMF moiety of the neighboring molecule and also a π⋯C–H (2.886 Å) interaction between the same set of molecules. In addition, π⋯C–H (2.818 Å) interaction between the PHO moiety and DMF moiety of another neighboring molecule was also observed.

3.2 Time resolved photophysical characterization

3.2.1 Time resolved emission spectra. 
In order to understand the spectral dynamics of the emitting species by changing the excitation wavelength and polarity of the solvent, the time resolved emission spectra of PXFCN in CHX and ACN were measured by exciting at 274, 331 and 378 nm using LED sources. Fig. 6 shows the emission spectra of PXFCN in CHX in the time scale starting from 1 to 20 ns obtained by exciting at different wavelengths. In Fig. 6a the emission spectra obtained by exciting at 274 nm showed a maximum at around 430 nm with a shoulder at around 460 nm at 1 ns consistent with steady state emission spectra in CHX (Fig. 2). With the increase of the delay time, there was a decrease in the overall spectral intensity. Fig. 6b and c reflect that there are no significant changes in the spectral patterns obtained by exciting at 331 and 378 nm compared to the excitation at 274 nm.
 Fig. 6  Time-resolved emission spectra of PXFCN in CHX obtained by exciting at 274 (a), 331 (b) and 378 (c) nm shown for spectral delay time from 1 to 20 ns. Spline function is used along with the experimental data. 
Interestingly, the time resolved emission spectra of PXFCN in ACN obtained by exciting at 274, 331 and 378 nm showed different spectral behaviours (Fig. 7, 8 and Fig. S10, ESI†). In the case of 274 nm excitation, the time resolved emission spectra at early time scale (0.5 to 2.5 ns) showed two emission maxima at around 600 nm with higher intensity and 330 nm (Fig. 7a). With the increase of delay time to 3.5 ns, the intensity of both the maxima decreased and another weak peak was observed at around 430 nm. It is also possible that the peak at 430 nm might have appeared at early time scale, however it is not seen as the other two peaks having higher intensity. Further increase of the delay time to 7.0 ns the peak at around 600 nm disappeared and the peak at around 430 nm persisted with feeble intensity (Fig. 7c). As shown in Fig. S10a (ESI†) the time resolved emission spectra obtained by exciting at 331 nm exhibited two emission maxima at ∼410 nm with higher intensity and 600 nm. With the increase of delay time the intensity of both peaks at around 410 and 600 nm decreased. The emission spectra at 11 ns showed a maximum at around 430 nm with a weak intensity (Fig. S10b, ESI†).
 Fig. 7  Time-resolved emission spectra of PXFCN in ACN obtained by exciting at 274 nm shown for spectral delay time from 0.5 to 2.5 (a), 3.5 to 7.0 (b) and 10 to 40 ns (c). Spline function is used along with the experimental data. 
For the 378 nm excitation (Fig. 8), the time resolved emission spectra showed two maxima at around 590 nm with higher intensity and around 430 nm. With the increase of the delay time, the intensity of the peak at around 590 nm decreased and emission maxima at around 430 nm persisted for 12 ns (Fig. 8b). It is to be noted that weak emission spectra obtained on a longer time scale (∼10 ns) in ACN by exciting at all the three excitation wavelengths are similar to the steady state emission spectra of PXFCN in CHX (Fig. 2). The peak observed at 330 nm by exciting at 274 nm in ACN is attributed to the emission arising from the DMF moiety as it is comparable to the emission maximum of DMF in ACN (Fig. S2, ESI†). Similarly, the peak at ∼410 nm seen only by the excitation at 331 nm compared to other excitation, is due to the PHO moiety in PXFCN (Fig. S2, ESI†).

The fluorescence kinetic profiles of PXFCN obtained by exciting at 274, 331 and 378 nm and probed at the corresponding emission maxima in ACN and CHX are shown in Fig. S11, ESI.† The fluorescence dynamics of PXFCN in CHX for three different excitation wavelengths were fitted with a single exponential whereas the dynamics in ACN showed bi-exponential time constants. The fluorescence time constants of PXFCN in CHX and ACN obtained by exciting at different wavelengths are provided in Table 3. The fluorescence lifetime of 1.92 ns obtained for the maximum at 432 nm in CHX did not vary significantly by changing the excitation wavelengths and is assigned to the lifetime of the local excited state. The major fluorescence time constant of 1.16 ns obtained for the emission maximum at around 620 nm in ACN did not change significantly by changing the excitation wavelength. This is attributed to the time constant of the relaxed or twisted ICT of PXFCN. Importantly the dominant fluorescence time constants on the nanosecond time scale, for example 1.92 and 1.16 ns for CHX and ACN respectively, obtained by the TCSPC technique are consistent with the time constants obtained in the femtosecond transient absorption spectra which will be discussed in the next section (vide infra). It should be noted that the fluorescence dynamics of PXFCN upon excitation at DMF (274 nm) and PHO (331 nm) moieties exhibit a rise with a time constant of about 300 ps. Such a raising component has not been observed in the 378 nm excitation and it needs further investigation. In ACN, the longer time constant (∼4.1 ns) with smaller amplitude observed at around 433 nm for all the excitation wavelengths reflects the occurrence of emission on a longer time scale from the local excited state with weak population.

Overall the spectral patterns of the steady and time resolved emission spectra in CHX obtained by changing the excitation wavelength are similar revealing the occurrence of the efficient intramolecular energy transfer in CHX compared to ACN. The time resolved fluorescence spectra as a function of excitation wavelength are significantly different in ACN when compared to CHX. Such a difference could be attributed to the changes in the spectral overlap integral and transition dipole moment of the donor and acceptor by the changing polarity of the solvent.34 In ACN, the observation of emission maxima at 620 nm along with two maxima at 330 and 410 nm by exciting the PXFCN at 274 nm in the time resolved as well as in steady state emission spectra would reflect the occurrence of intramolecular energy transfer from the DMF moiety to the PHO moiety and then to the CT absorption band of the compound.
Fluorescence anisotropy dynamics of PXFCN in ACN and CHX were investigated to explore the time evolution of the orientation of the excitation–emission transition dipole moments which accompanies the CT. The time resolved emission anisotropy, defined by the general eqn (7), was measured by using the TCSPC by exciting at 274, 331 and 378 nm with parallel (I‖) and perpendicular (I⊥) excitation–detection configurations. (7)
The fluorescence anisotropy decays of PXFCN in CHX and ACN are shown in Fig. S12 and S13, ESI.† The initial values of 0.2–0.4 at around zero time represent that the absorption and emission transition dipole moments are parallel. The different initial anisotropy values observed particularly in CHX could be due to the donor and acceptor groups oriented independently randomly leading to significant depolarization.35 Interestingly the anisotropy dynamics obtained by exciting at 331 nm decays from a positive to local minimum of ∼−0.06 indicating the large angle between the excitation and emission dipole moments.36 This observation reveals that the individual chromophores of DMF and PHO are in the twisted form and consistent with the theoretical optimization (Fig. S5, ESI†) as well as the single crystal structure (Fig. 5).


3.2.2 Nanosecond transient absorption spectra. 
Transient absorption spectra of PXFCN in CHX and ACN were measured by exciting at 355 nm using a nanosecond laser flash photolysis system in an inert atmosphere at room temperature. Fig. 9a shows the nanosecond transient absorption spectra of PXFCN in CHX obtained at different delay times after laser excitation. The transient absorption spectra in CHX showed the absorption maximum at around 400 nm with a shoulder at around 360 and 520 nm. The negative change in absorbance, the bleach at around 310 nm, is attributed to the ground state absorption of the compound. With the increase of the delay time, an overall decrease of absorbance was observed. In the case of ACN (Fig. 9b), the transient absorption spectra consists of two absorption maxima at around 400 and 540 nm equal in intensity along with a shoulder at around 420 nm. The absorbance of these peaks decreased with increase of delay time.
 Fig. 9  Nanosecond transient absorption spectra of PXFCN obtained by laser flash photolysis at 355 nm in Ar saturated CHX (a) and ACN (b) shown on different time scales. Inset (a) shows the decay probed at 520 nm with and without β-carotene. Inset (b) shows transient absorption spectra at 430 ns after the laser pulse measured under argon (black) and oxygen (red) saturated conditions for comparison. A spline function is used along with the experimental data. 
To understand the nature of the transient species, the transient absorption spectra of PXFCN under aerated (oxygen purged) conditions with a standard triplet sensitizer, β-carotene, were measured. The corresponding transient absorption spectra and the kinetic profiles were compared. The quenching of the dynamics at 400 nm and simultaneous growth of the peak at 520 nm due to the formation of the triplet state of β-carotene were observed (inset a). The inset b compares the transient absorption spectra of PXFCN in ACN in argon and oxygen atmospheres at 430 ns after laser irradiation. In the presence of oxygen the intensity of the peak at around 400 nm quenched completely, whereas the peak at 540 nm persisted (inset b). Hence the absorption maximum at around 400 nm is attributed to the triplet state absorption since it is quenched in the presence of oxygen and with triplet sensitizer β-carotene and also based on the formation of the triplet state of β-carotene absorption at around 520 nm by the triplet–triplet energy transfer.37 The absorption maximum at around 540 nm which is insensitive to the presence of oxygen, has been assigned to the phenoxazine radical cation and supported by the literature.38 In addition, the spectroelectrochemistry of PXFCN was carried out in ACN and with the increase of the oxidation potential the absorption spectra showed a maximum at 535 nm (Fig. S14, ESI†) confirming the formation of a radical cation of the phenoxazine moiety.
Fig. S15 in the ESI† compares the kinetic profiles of PXFCN probed at 400 and 540 nm in CHX and ACN. The time constant of the radical cation absorbed at 540 nm was found to be around 2.55 μs in ACN and more stabilized compared to that in CHX (463 ns). This could be due to the high polarity of ACN (ε = 36.64) where the charge separation is more efficient compared to CHX (ε = 2.02). The lifetime of the triplet state absorbed around 400 nm was determined to be ∼473 and 207 ns in CHX and ACN respectively. Thus the triplet state absorption dynamics measured by the nanosecond laser flash photolysis system is stabilized in CHX when compared to ACN, and a similar trend is also observed in femtosecond transient absorption spectra (vide infra). This is consistent with the report that triplet manifolds of fluorene derivatives are stabilized in nonpolar solvents compared to polar solvents.19,39


3.2.3 Femtosecond transient absorption spectra. 
In order to gain deeper insight into the influence of the solvent polarity and excitation energy on the dynamics of intermediates involved in the excited state relaxation pathway, femtosecond transient absorption spectra of PXFCN in polar and nonpolar solvents were measured by exciting at different wavelengths using the femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy with a time resolution of 120 fs.

Fig. 10 and Fig. S16, S17 (ESI†) show the transient absorption spectra of PXFCN in CHX obtained by exciting at 311, 330 and 385 nm, respectively. Fig. 10a shows the spectral evolution starting from −200 to 650 fs time scale. The transient absorption spectra at some representative time delays are shown for clarity. Normally the positive optical density ΔOD > 0 corresponds to photoinduced absorption of excited species, and ΔOD < 0 represents the depopulation of the ground state or the stimulated emission. During the early time scales, the transient absorption maximum at around 490 nm splits into two maxima at around 427 and 520 nm. With the increase of the delay time to 1.5 ns, the intensity of both the peaks decreased with simultaneous formation of weak peaks at around 352 and 397 nm. Similar kinds of spectral dynamics were observed for 330 and 385 nm excitation wavelengths (Fig. S16 and S17, ESI†). It is to be noted that there is a dip at around 428 nm in the transient absorption spectra obtained by exciting at 385 nm due to the stimulated Raman scattering of the C–H stretching vibration (2950 cm−1) of the solvent signal. The peak at ∼397 nm is not seen due to the scattering of the 385 nm laser excitation.
 Fig. 10  Femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectra of PXFCN in CHX upon excitation at 311 nm, shown at different time delays. The arrows show the direction of the spectral evolution. 
The transient absorption spectra of PXFCN in ACN obtained by exciting at three different excitation wavelengths viz., 311, 330 and 385 nm are shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. S18, S19 (ESI†), respectively. As observed in CHX (Fig. 10a), there is an evolution of two peaks at around 422 and 515 nm in ACN (Fig. 11a). With the increase of the delay time to 1.5 ns, the intensity of both the peaks decreased (Fig. 11b). It should be noted that in ACN there is no formation of peak at around 397 nm as observed in CHX. To compare the dynamics of transient absorption maxima at around 420 and 520 nm in CHX and ACN for various excitation wavelengths, the normalized kinetic profiles are given in Fig. S20 and S21 (ESI†), respectively. It is observed that compared to CHX, the dynamics come back to equilibrium promptly in ACN for all the three excitation wavelengths.

Analysis. 
The femtosecond transient absorption spectra obtained in the format of a three-dimensional data set (wavelength, time, and change in absorbance) was analysed with the global analysis program GLOTARAN.40 The excited state relaxation dynamics of the push–pull chromophores cannot be described by a mono exponential time constant, as it could overlap with other simultaneous processes of solvation dynamics, intramolecular vibrational redistribution, vibrational relaxation, and conformational relaxation leading to the complex dynamics.12a Four exponential components were optimally obtained to fully describe the excited state relaxation dynamics of PXFCN in ACN and CHX. The resulting time constants for all the three excitation wavelengths are given in Table 4 and the corresponding decay associated spectra are shown for comparison in the ESI† in Fig. S22 and S23. As there is no significant changes in time constants by changing the excitation wavelengths in a given solvent, the time constants of PXFCN obtained by exciting at 385 nm are considered for discussion and those are τ1 = 380 fs, τ2 = 1.30 ps, τ3 = 17.20 ps, and τ4 ≥ 1.09 ns in ACN and τ1 = 750 fs, τ2 = 15.00 ps, τ3 = 2.0 ns and τ4 ≥ 8.9 ns in CHX. It is to be noted that the longest time constant will be affected by an error, since the measurable maximum delay time in our system is 1.7 ns.

ACN. 
Since the excited state absorption maximum at ∼422 nm shifted to the blue region with the increase of intensity at early time scales, the fastest component (τ1 = 380 fs) obtained for 385 nm excitation in ACN is associated with the average of the solvation relaxation process from the Franck–Condon state to the solvent stabilized local excited state.41 It is recognized from the chemical structure of PXFCN that the individual chromophores of DMF and PHO in PXFCN will be (partially) twisted with respect each other due to π–π interaction, supported by theoretical optimization as well as the crystal structure where the torsion angle between the PHO and DMF is 118.69°. It is known that the partially twisted intramolecular charge transfer state (PTICT) could be observed or tracked in the femtosecond time resolved transient absorption spectra in polar solvent ACN.12a The decay associated spectra of τ2, 1.3 ps time constant have positive features at around 440 and 520 nm. This could be due to the absorption spectra of partially twisted intramolecular charge transfer state where the formation of the phenoxazine radical cation absorbing at around 520 nm was confirmed by spectroelectrochemistry (Fig. S14, ESI†), nanosecond laser flash photolysis experiments (Fig. 9) and the literature.38a Hence the time constant of 1.3 ps, τ2 is assigned to solvent stabilized or the formation of the PTICT state. It is known that the dynamics of the CT processes are significantly controlled by solvation dynamics and intramolecular relaxation.11a,11c Alternatively, these time constants (τ1 and τ2) would represent the processes of intramolecular vibrational relaxation along with solvation relaxation, as the chromophore will be vibrationally hot upon femtosecond laser excitation. As discussed previously, the appearance of broad emission spectra with a relatively large Stokes shift in ACN compared to CHX reflect that the compounds would undergo further structural change upon photoexcitation in polar solvent. Hence in high polarity solvent the PTICT state would undergo further relaxation involving both the solvent and vibrational coordinates yielding a completely twisted intramolecular charge transfer state (TICT) with the change of the dipole moment (18.01 D experimentally determined). Hence the time constant τ3 (17 ps) is attributed to the formation of the TICT state. Thus the radical cation and anion species absorbing at around 520 and 420 nm, respectively are formed separately by charge transfer occurring along with the intramolecular twisting relaxation process. It is interesting to note that the longest time constant, τ4 obtained through global analysis is matching with fluorescence lifetime of PXFCN in ACN (1.19 ns). Hence the longest time constant is assigned to the decay of the twisted intramolecular charge transfer state.
CHX. 
In the case of CHX, the time constant of 750 fs, τ1 is assigned to the vibrational relaxation from the Frank–Condon state to the LE state rather than the solvation relaxation time constant. This is based on the fact that early spectral evolution of C334 in CHX showed changes in the vibrational patterns rather than the shift of the transient absorption spectra.42 For the time constant of 15 ps, τ2 is attributed to the conformational structural relaxation process to attain to the formation of TICT. When compared to ACN, there is a formation of peaks around 400 and 360 nm in the femtosecond transient absorption spectra in CHX and consistent with the nanosecond transient absorption spectra (Fig. 9a). Hence the time constant τ3 of 2.0 ns obtained in CHX is associated with the decay of the TICT to the triplet state as it shows the decrease of the TICT signal and increase in the triplet signal. It is supported by the fact that the formation of the triplet is favoured in the non-polar solvent compared to polar solvent and it is consistent with the literature43 related to fluorene derivatives. In addition the time constant τ3 obtained in the femtosecond transient absorption spectra is consistent with fluorescence lifetime of PXFCN in CHX. The time constant τ4 of 8.9 ns is related to the decay of the triplet state and it would have error due to the instrument limitation. It is measured accurately in the nanosecond laser flash photolysis system and found to be 473 ns.
Overall it is observed from the time-resolved absorption studies that the CT dynamics yielding the radical species such as radical cation and anion are seen in both the solvents, however the CT states are stabilized in ACN. This may be due to the more polar characteristics of the excited state in ACN compared to CHX. It is known that the charge separated state would generally recombine to yield the triplet state which is clearly seen in the femtosecond transient absorption spectra measured in CHX.44 Wasielewski and coworkers demonstrated for perpendicular donor–acceptor systems of julolidine fused anthracene derivatives that recombination of the charge separated state forming a triplet excited state depended on the degree of charge separation, the relative orientation of the orbitals involved in the CT, and the magnitude of the electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor.26,34 In addition the time resolved EPR was used to reveal the underlying mechanism of triplet formation by charge recombination depending on the radical pair distances and temperatures.38a,45 In ACN the solvent stabilized or TICT state suppress the efficient intersystem crossing process (ISC) by dipolar interactions with solvent molecules and the triplet state is higher in energy than the fully relaxed TICT state. Based on the above observation the excited state relaxation dynamics of PXFCN in CHX and ACN are shown in Scheme 1.

4. Summary
In summary, the excited state relaxation dynamics of PXFCN was investigated in detail by changing the polarity of the solvents and excitation wavelengths by using steady state spectroscopy, time resolved absorption spectroscopy including a femtosecond pump–probe spectrometer and a nanosecond laser flash photolysis system and time resolved emission spectroscopy. The steady state emission spectra of PXFCN in ACN obtained upon excitation at 310 nm showed three maxima (330, 405 and 620 nm) covering the entire continuum range (CIE co-ordinates of 0.32, 0.40) with an absolute quantum yield of ∼0.12, hence it could be used for organic light emitting devices. The steady and time resolved emission spectra obtained upon excitation at different wavelengths indicate that the emission arises mainly from the local excited state in CHX. In the case of ACN the molecules undergoes further conformational changes leading to emission arising from the individual moiety as well as through the intramolecular energy transfer in addition to the emission arising from the twisted intramolecular charge transfer state. Femtosecond and nanosecond transient absorption spectra exhibited the formation of charge separated species after photoexcitation in both CHX and ACN where the CT state was stabilized in polar solvent of ACN. The formation of the triplet state by recombination of the charge separated species is dominant in CHX. Thus based on time resolved photophysical characterization, it is determined that the ICT occurring along with the energy transfer is governed by the polarity of the solvent through conformational relaxation processes.

 	Fig. 9  Nanosecond transient absorption spectra of PXFCN obtained by laser flash photolysis at 355 nm in Ar saturated CHX (a) and ACN (b) shown on different time scales. Inset (a) shows the decay probed at 520 nm with and without β-carotene. Inset (b) shows transient absorption spectra at 430 ns after the laser pulse measured under argon (black) and oxygen (red) saturated conditions for comparison. A spline function is used along with the experimental data.	 

 	Fig. 10  Femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectra of PXFCN in CHX upon excitation at 311 nm, shown at different time delays. The arrows show the direction of the spectral evolution.	 

 	Fig. 11  Femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectra of PXFCN in ACN upon excitation at 311 nm shown at different time delays. The arrows represent the direction of the spectral evolution.
