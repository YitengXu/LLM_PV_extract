    , Accepted 14th December 2017First published on 15th December 2017AbstractHerein, we report the synthesis of multimetallic core–satellite nanodendrites (Pt@Au@rGO) composed of nano-sized reduced graphene oxide (50–60 nm) wrapped gold nanoparticles (30 nm) as the core and ultra-small platinum nanoparticles as the satellites. These were then used as a highly active catalyst for CO2 photoreduction to HCOOH (quantum yield = 1.95%, chemical yield = 3.31%) with excellent reusability and colloidal stability.
Minimization of CO2 levels is essential to addressing issues such as global warming and fossil fuel shortage. However, because of the high dissociation energy of the CO bond (∼750 kJ mol−1), CO2 is one of the most stable molecules and its conversion is a big challenge.1 A solar-based conversion is a persuasive approach amid various CO2 confiscation options to recycle CO2 back to hydrocarbon fuels or other useful organic molecules.
Noble metal nanomaterials could be an attractive solution because of their strong light (visible and NIR) absorption and subsequent hot electron generation capabilities.2 In the past decades, enormous efforts have been dedicated to the synthesis of noble monometallic nanoparticles in different morphologies due to their interesting applications in catalysis.3 Although, due to the intrinsic ultrafast relaxation of hot electrons in the metal, monometallic plasmonic nanoparticles lack photoconversion efficiency.4 The activity, selectivity and physical or chemical stability of monometallic nanoparticles can be improved greatly through the preparation of bimetallic or multimetallic nanoparticles with different shapes and sizes.5 Ru2–Ru(CO),6 Ru(II)–Re(I) complex,7 and ruthenium(II) complexes8 are a few examples reported for photoreduction of CO2 to HCOOH with a quantum yield of 0.46%, 0.2%, and 0.088%, respectively, in visible light illumination. Carbon nanoparticles coated with Au and Pt showed 0.3% of quantum yield for HCOOH formation in visible light illumination for 5 h.9 More recently C3N4–Pd nanoparticles,10 g-C3N4–carbon nanodots,11 LaPO4 hollow spheres,12 and Bi2WO6/Au/CdS nanoparticles13 were also reported for CO2 photoconversion to CH4 and/or CO. Moreover, the synthesis of multimetallic nanoparticles consisting of multiple (n ≥ 3) components could enable access to multi-functional nanomaterials with foremost performance benefits and can enable utilization of the entire solar spectrum region. Consequently, precise control of the shape, composition, and resulting morphology of multi-metallic nanostructures not only improves their catalytic efficacy and longevity but also amplifies their range of applications.2
Herein, we have demonstrated the synthesis of bimetallic–graphene sandwiched colloidal plasmonic nanodendrites (Pt@Au@rGO), consisting of gold nanoparticles coated with reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (Au@rGO) as the core and ultra-small platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) as the satellites, in high yield with well-defined spherical dendritic morphology. The prepared Pt@Au@rGO nanodendrites are explored as a plasmonic photo-system for energy conversion (CO2 reduction to HCOOH) with excellent colloidal stability.
The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping image (Fig. 1b), TEM images (Fig. S2b, ESI†), and FESEM images of the Pt@Au@rGO (Fig. S2a, ESI†) show the uniform deposition of PtNPs (3–4 nm) on rGO wrapped AuNPs. The presence of approximately 2 nm rGO layer is clearly visible in the HRTEM image (Fig. 1c). The lattice fringes with spacing of 0.23 nm and 0.20 nm indicate that AuNPs are bound by (111) and (200) fcc planes, respectively. Also, the lattice fringes with a periodic spacing of 0.23 nm correspond to Pt nanoparticles bound by (111) a fcc plane (Fig. 1c). Moreover, the red-shifts from 525 to 530 nm as AuNPs coated with rGO, and 530 nm to 550 nm with a uniform coating of PtNPs on Au@rGO (Pt@Au@rGO) and broadening of the spectra were observed after the deposition of Pt nanoparticles on Au@rGO (Fig. 1d). On the other hand, Fig. S1b and c (ESI†) show uniform deposition of PtNPs and AgNPs on AuNPs, respectively. A uniform coating of a 4–5 nm layer of TiO2 on AuNPs was observed in the TEM image (Fig. S1d, ESI†) and a red-shift in the UV-visible spectrum (525 nm to 540 nm, Fig. S1f, ESI†).

In a typical photo-conversion reaction of CO2, the nanoparticles solution (10 mL, O.D. = 1.0) was placed in a Pyrex glass reactor equipped with a water circulation jacket (Fig. S3b and c, ESI†). Then, the CO2 was purged into the nanoparticles solution for 30 min to saturation (0.24 mg mL−1). A Xe lamp was used for visible light irradiation, whereas a NIR (808 nm) laser (Fig. S2d, ESI†) was used as a source of NIR light irradiation. In the plasmon assisted CO2 photo-reduction process, first of all, there is a generation of hydrogen from the aqueous medium through water splitting by light irradiation and then there is a chemical reaction between the hydrogen and CO2 (dissolved in aqueous medium) to generate HCOOH and CH3OH (Fig. 1a).9,14 Two separate experiments were conducted which also supported the above stated mechanism (Section 2.8, ESI†).
In a heterocatalytic photo-system, the photogenerated electrons become adsorbed on the catalyst surfaces and can reduce CO2 into HCOOH, CO, CH3OH or CH4 (Scheme S1, ESI†).15 The formation of product depends on the number of electrons available for reduction. The first two steps are similar to that of water splitting and there is a formation of H2. In the present system, HCOOH is the major product, whereas CH3OH is a minor product in CO2 photoconversion. The formation of HCOOH is simplest in comparison to other products as it required only a two electron based reduction. Whereas, the formation of CH3OH required a six electron reduction and is more tedious than HCOOH formation, this being one reason for a lesser yield, though it is thermodynamically more feasible because of its less negative redox potentials. The other major reason for the lesser CH3OH yield is due to the fact that CH3OH acts as a hole scavenger, preventing fast electron–hole recombination, and thus contributes to providing more electrons for the HCOOH formation.16
The 1H-NMR spectrum showed a chemical shift at 8.014 ppm (Hz) corresponding to the aldehyde proton (H–CO) (Fig. 3b) and the chemical shift at 165.93 ppm (Hz) in the 13C-NMR spectrum supports the formation of HCOOH through CO2 photo-conversion (Fig. 2a).9 The GC-MS analysis of the final reaction mixture showed the formation of only two main products; with peaks at the retention times of 104 s and 201 s corresponding to methanol (area%: 15%) and HCOOH (area%: 85%) from the Pt@Au@rGO (Fig. 2b), and similarly methanol (area%: 30%) and HCOOH (area%: 70%) from the Pt@AuNPs (Fig. 2b).9 High selectivity of Pt@Au@rGO for HCOOH (>85%) formation is an important aspect of particles for practical use in solar fuel systems.17 In addition, the methanol formation is beneficial as it is useful for direct methanol fuel cells. Mass spectrum analysis shows the exact molecular ion peak fragmentation of formic acid (m/z: 46 (HCOOH+), 45 (HCOO+), and 44 (COO+)) and methanol (m/z: 32 (CH3OH+), 31 (CH2OH), and 29 (COH+)) as shown in Fig. 2e and f, respectively. The peaks at 1368 cm−1, 1603 cm−1, and 2855 cm−1 in the FTIR spectrum after 4 h of reaction time (Fig. 2c) also indicate the presence of HCOONa, and correspond to symmetric OC–O stretching, asymmetric OC–O stretching, and C–H stretching, respectively.18 The starting reaction mixture (without light irradiation) showed the characteristic Raman peak of the D (1350 cm−1) and G bands (1591 cm−1) of graphene.19 After 4 h of light irradiation, the resulting mixture showed characteristic Raman shifts for HCOOH at 624 cm−1 (OCO bending), 919 cm−1 (HOC stretching), 1048 cm−1 (HCO stretching), 1220 cm−1 (CO stretching), 1420 cm−1 (HOC bending) along with 1350 cm−1 (D band), and 1591 cm−1 (G band), respectively (Fig. 2d).20

The localized surface plasmon is strongly dependent on the wavelength maxima and has a direct impact on the hot electron generation and light absorption, which in turn depends on the size and shape of nanostructures. The CO2 photo-conversion reactions were carried out in the presence of visible light (Xe lamp; 390–770 nm), NIR light (808 nm laser) and sunlight (solar simulator). Bare AuNPs did not show noticeable photo-conversion when irradiated with visible or NIR light. No significant CO2 conversion in spite of resonant plasmonic absorption of bare AuNPs in visible region could be due to the very short lifetime of the hot electrons.21 On the other hand, rGO coated AuNPs shows a 1.57% quantum yield (QY) and 2.66% chemical yield (CY) for formic acid formation in the presence of visible light. Moreover, there was a remarkable increase in the QY (1.95%) and CY (3.31%) with Pt@Au@rGO while using visible light irradiation (Fig. 3a).

However, Pt@Au@rGO shows moderate efficiency for HCOOH formation with 0.38% of QY and 0.71% of CY in the presence of NIR light (Fig. 3a). Au@rGO showed 0.09% of QY and 0.15% of CY in the presence of NIR light. The lower efficiency was due to the absence of plasmon resonance band of Pt@Au@rGO in the NIR region. For photo-conversion reactions, sunlight is the ultimate and most desirable source of light. In order to find the efficiency of Pt@Au@rGO using solar energy, photo-conversion of CO2 was performed on a solar simulator (AM 1.5, power density = 0.23 W cm−2). The Au@rGO and Pt@Au@rGO solutions saturated with CO2 were illuminated with light from the solar simulator for 4.0 h, and the quantum yields were found to be 0.19% and 0.30%, respectively (Fig. 3b). The lesser efficiency, as compared to visible light irradiation, was due to the low power density of the solar simulator (0.23 W cm−2) as compared to the Xe lamp (6.11 W cm−2). The photocatalytic activity of rGO alone (OD 1.0 at 270 nm, 0.125 mg mL−1) was also tested and it showed moderate photocatalytic activity (quantum yield = 0.27%, chemical yield = 0.45%) after 4 h of visible light irradiation. The reason for its photocatalytic activity is the band gap of rGO (2.4–4.3 eV), which is suitable for hydrogen generation through water splitting.22 This experiment evidently demonstrated the importance of using rGO as the interfaced material between Au and Pt.
In order to compare the selectivity of noble metals for CO2 photo-conversion, Pt@AuNPs and Ag@AuNPs were used for reduction of CO2 in visible light irradiation. Pt@AuNPs nanoparticles were found to be more efficient with 2.14% of the chemical yield and 1.26% of the quantum yield as compared to 1.84% of the chemical yield and 1.08% of the quantum yield with Ag@AuNPs (Fig. 3c). The Pt has a lower hydrogen overvoltage as compared to Ag, hydrogen overvoltage has the inverse effect on hydrogen evolution, which could be the reason for the higher efficiency of Pt.23 The efficacy of the interface layer of rGO was also compared with TiO2 which is foremost frequently used in interface materials21 in photocatalytic processes. With a 2.66% chemical yield and a 1.57% quantum yield, Au@rGO (2–3 nm rGO layer) was found to be more efficient than Au@TiO2 (4–5 nm TiO2 layer) with a 1.45% chemical yield and a 0.86% quantum yield for the CO2 reduction in visible light irradiation (Fig. 3c).
The results indicate that the presence of PtNPs, certainly the most effective co-catalyst, accelerating the splitting of H2O to H2 which make it highly selective for CO2 reduction (83% on a carbon basis),24 and rGO layer which has high electron acceptance and mobility which are crucial factors for CO2 photo-conversion along with the plasmonic effect (Fig. 3a). The huge band gap of TiO2 could be the reason for the lesser efficiency of Au@TiO2. Moreover, the uniform PtNPs coating extended and broadened the surface plasmon band of Au@rGO with 20 nm of red-shift (530–550 nm) in the UV-visible spectrum, and hence, let it absorb more light energy which in turn helped to give higher proficiency.
The effect of particle concentration on the photoconversion efficiency was studied by varying optical density (O.D.) of Pt@Au@rGO from 0.5 to 3.0. There was linear increase in the yield as O.D. was increased from 0.5 (QY = 0.86%, CY = 1.42%) to 1.0 (QY = 1.95%, CY = 3.31%) and small increment was observed when O.D. increased from 1.0 to 2.0 (QY = 2.19%, CY = 3.72%). The slight decrease in yield was observed when O.D. of 3.0 (QY = 2.01%, CY = 3.41%) was used because of the aggregation of particles in the highly concentrated solution (Fig. 3d). The reaction progress with increasing reaction time has been studied using Pt@Au@rGO with an O.D. of 1.0. After 30 min of reaction progress, QY and CY were found to be 0.59% and 1.28%, respectively, which increases significantly to 1.95% (QY) and 3.31% (CY) with an increase in reaction time to 4 h (Fig. 3e). There was a linear increase in the yield with increasing reaction time.
In aqueous medium, water acts not only as a reaction medium but also as a hole scavenger, though methanol is better and more frequently used as a hole scavenger and hydrocarbon source for formic acid.25 Methanol avoids electron–hole recombination and hence improved the yield of HCOOH formation. When Pt@Au@rGO was illuminated with methanol (20%), the quantum yield and chemical yield were increased to 2.23% and 3.78%, respectively (Fig. 3f).
The high photothermal effect is an integral property of plasmonic materials and expected to accelerate the rate of photoconversion reactions.15 All of the CO2 photoconversion reactions were carried out at room temperature to avoid the effects of temperature on the reaction rate. The effect of temperature on CO2 photoconversion has been analyzed using Pt@Au@rGO by carrying out the CO2 reduction reaction without temperature control for 30 min. Along with ultra-fast transportation of electrons, rGO itself is also useful for water splitting to generate hydrogen, which certainly contributed to the CO2 photoconversion to HCOOH. The strong photothermal effect of Pt@Au@rGO increases the temperature rapidly from 25 °C to 52 °C in 10 min then 50 °C to 65 °C for 20 min and further increased to 82 °C after 30 min in visible light illumination. As was evident, there was a direct influence of temperature on the quantum yield and chemical yield, which were 0.87% and 1.47% after 10 min, 1.42% and 2.41% after 20 min and 1.92% and 3.26% after 30 min, respectively (Fig. 4a). The nanoparticles structure was found to be stable even when the temperature reached 82 °C, showed a robust morphological and colloidal stability.
 Fig. 4  (a) Effect of temperature on reaction progress for CO2 photo-conversion in visible light. (b) Reusability study of Pt@Au@rGO for CO2 reduction using a Xe lamp. 
In order to show the robustness of the prepared photocatalyst, the CO2 reduction has been carried out at three different monochromatic wavelengths. These were: 450 nm, 550 nm, and 650 nm and the quantum yield was found to be 0.27%, 0.47%, and 0.26%, respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†). The results agree very well with the plasmon band (550 nm) of Pt@Au@rGO (Fig. 1d). The lesser yield as compared to whole visible region irradiation was due to the lesser power density of light irradiation while using wavelength filters.
Additionally, the recyclability and efficacy of plasmonic nanoparticles in each application is intrinsically linked to their colloidal stability, as small changes in temperature or pH or the surface coating or concentration can affect stability significantly. The Pt@Au@rGO was recycled after 4.0 h of reaction time and re-used for the CO2 photo-conversion for five times under visible light illumination. The photo-conversion efficiency was found to be consistent, this was supported by the gas chromatogram (Fig. S5b, ESI†) and there was no significant change in the QY and CY (Fig. 4b).
Furthermore, the OD of Pt@Au@rGO, and Pt@AuNPs at 550 nm, and 540 nm, respectively, were found to be almost constant (Fig. S5a, ESI†), signifying the excellent colloidal stability of all the plasmonic nanostructures during the reaction, and also the reason for the steady performance during the reusability study of Pt@Au@rGO. The UV-Visible spectra (Fig. S6a, ESI†) and the TEM image (Fig. S6b, ESI†) of the recycled nanoparticles also supported the colloidal and morphological stability. Moreover, there was a huge increase, 300 fold in visible light and 70 fold in NIR light illumination, for CO2 photoconversion efficiency after PtNPs and rGO attachment to gold nanoparticles (Fig. S7a and b, ESI†).
In conclusion, the multimetallic (AuPt–graphene sandwiched) nanoparticles were synthesized in the colloidal form utilizing the solution-based methods with well defined spherical dendritic morphology. The as prepared Pt@Au@rGO nanodendrites were found to be a highly efficient photocatalyst for CO2 photoconversion to HCOOH with 1.95% of the quantum yield, and 3.31% of the chemical yield. In a comparative study, PtNPs were found to be more selective towards CO2 reduction as compared to AgNPs, and rGO was found to be a better interface layer material than TiO2 for photocatalytic reactions. Moreover, the PtNPs coating increases the stability and is the reason for its consistent performance for multiple reaction cycles. It is a new class of plasmonic photo-system modality for solar-driven CO2 photoconversion to HCOOH in high yields.
