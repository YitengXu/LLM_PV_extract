    , Accepted 10th July 2013First published on 10th July 2013AbstractThe development of arylamine photosensitizers with high extinction coefficients, and suitable electronic structures and steric properties is necessary for improving the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) employing iodine-free redox shuttles. A new truxene-based organic sensitizer, M20, incorporating a 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) moiety as an electron donor was synthesized and compared to its reference sensitizer, M4. M20 sensitized DSCs employing the Co(II/III) tris(1,10-phenanthroline)-based redox electrolyte exhibit a short circuit photocurrent of 11.8 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 903 mV, and a fill factor of 0.69, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 7.35% under standard AM 1.5 sunlight, which is higher than that of 6.86% for equivalent M4 sensitized DSCs. The effects of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) as an additive on the photovoltaic performance of truxene-dye-sensitized nanocrystallineTiO2 solar cells were also investigated.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have recently received great attention because of their ease of fabrication and cost-effectiveness compared with silicon (Si) based photovoltaic devices.1 During the past two decades, numerous research attempts have been made to explore new photosensitizers to assist in the development of DSCs.2–5 Of all the photosensitizers examined thus far, the arylamine organic dyes,6 holding the record for a validated efficiency of over 10.3%,7 are promising candidates for application in highly efficient DSCs.8–10
In the past decade, organic sensitizers have been intensely explored, mainly for application in DSCs based on a conventional iodine electrolyte, with power conversion efficiencies of over 10%. However, there are some disadvantages of the iodide/triiodide redox couple which limit the performance of the associated DSC, such as: (i) its relatively high overpotential for dye regeneration which has led to a noticeable potential loss;11 (ii) the halogen bonding between iodine and some electron-rich segments of dye molecules which can cause a larger charge recombination rate at the titania/electrolyte interface;12–14 (iii) competitive light absorption by the triiodide which leads to reduced light harvesting;15,16 and (iv) the corrosiveness of the iodide/triiodide redox couple toward most metals and sealing materials which makes the large-scale manufacturing of the corresponding DSCs challenging.17
To avoid the problems mentioned above, much effort has been devoted to the search for a suitable iodine-free electrolyte. Amongst all of the iodine-free liquid electrolytes, so far only the cobalt redox couples with the use of organic dyes have shown impressively high efficiencies comparable to the iodide/triiodide electrolyte.18,19 However, simply replacing the iodide/triiodide couple in the DSCs with cobalt redox couples may lead to poorly performing devices with low photovoltages and photocurrents, which has been attributed to the slow mass transport and increased recombination of photoinjected electrons with oxidized redox species in the electrolyte.20 Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the exploration of bulky arylamine dyes with high extinction coefficients for iodine-free dye-sensitized solar cells.21 As part of our systematic development of bulky arylamine dyes, we have demonstrated that truxene-based organic dyes exhibit high extinction coefficients yet are capable of retarding charge recombination, benefiting from the steric hindrance of the hexapropyltruxene group.22
To further optimize the light harvesting capability as well as the photovoltage of truxene-based organic dyes, our research is focused on tuning the electronic and steric traits of the electron donor. 3,4-Ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) is well-known for its high electron-richness and excellent coplanarity. It has been widely investigated and applied in various electro-optical materials such as conducting polymers,23 electrochromic materials24 and counter electrodes for DSCs.7b,25 In recent years, it was found that the excellent photoelectric function of the EDOT unit was desirable for photosensitizers. A substantial number of organic dyes with EDOT as a spacer were developed for DSCs, also exhibiting impressive efficiencies.22a–d,26,27 Besides its use in organic dyes, EDOT has also been incorporated as the donor constituent of a heteroleptic ruthenium complex, yielding high photovoltaic efficiencies of over 9% under standard global AM 1.5 sunlight.28 We thus expected that the use of EDOT in the donor constituent of arylamine organic dyes could show interesting results. Moreover, the effects of EDOT in different electrolytes. i.e. the iodine and cobalt electrolytes, need to be elucidated. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there have been few investigations on this issue.
Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a highly efficient truxene organic dye (M20), by the introduction of EDOT as the donor constituent. This not only increases the extinction coefficient of the sensitizer by extending the π-conjugation of the donor, but also augments its steric hindrance, hence retarding charge recombination. M4 was prepared as a reference material to investigate the effects of EDOT on the photovoltaic performance of DSCs employing a tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II/III) redox couple (Fig. 1).

Experimental section
Materials and instruments
EDOT was purchased from Puyang Huicheng Chemical Industry Limited Company, China. All other solvents and chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade and used without further purification.
The melting points of the samples were measured with a RY-1 melting point apparatus (Tianfen, China). 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM-300 or AM-400 spectrometer. The reported chemical shifts were referenced against TMS. High resolution mass spectra were obtained with a Micromass GCT-TOF mass spectrometer.
Optical and electrochemical measurements
The absorption spectra of the dyes were measured with a HITACHI U-3310 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence measurements were carried out with a HITACHI F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements for the dye-sensitized films were performed on a Zennium electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER), with sensitized electrodes as the working electrode, Pt-wires as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP, 0.1 M) and MeCN were used as the supporting electrolyte and solvent, respectively. The measurements were calibrated using ferrocene as the standard.
Open circuit charge densities were measured and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) was performed on a Zennium electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER, Germany), which includes a green light-emitting diode (LED, 532 nm) and the corresponding control system. The intensity-modulated spectra were measured at room temperature with light intensities ranging from 5 to 75 W m−2, with a modulation frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz, and with a modulation amplitude of less than 5% of the light intensity.
Fabrication and characterization of DSCs
The TiO2 paste (particle size, 20 nm) was printed onto a conducting glass (Nippon Sheet Glass, Hyogo, Japan, fluorine-doped SnO2 over layer, sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq−1) using a screen printing technique. The film was dried in air at 120 °C for 30 min and then calcined at 500 °C for 30 min under flowing oxygen before cooling to room temperature. The heated electrodes were impregnated with a 0.05 M titanium tetrachloride solution in a water-saturated desiccator at 70 °C for 30 min and then fired again to give a ca. 3 μm thick mesoscopic TiO2 film. The TiO2 electrode was stained by immersing it into a 0.2 mM dye solution in a mixture of DCM–EtOH (v/v, 1:1) and it was then kept at room temperature for 24 h to allow completion of the sensitizer uptake. Then the sensitized electrodes were rinsed with dry ethanol and dried under a dry air flow. Pt catalyst was deposited on the FTO glass by coating with a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (40 mM in ethanol) with subsequent heat treatment at 395 °C for 15 min to give the photoanode. The sensitized electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich type cell with a 25 μm-thick Surlyn (DuPont) hot-melt gasket and subsequent sealing by heating. The cobalt electrolyte was composed of 0.25 M [Co(II)(phen)3](PF6)2, 0.05 M [Co(III)(phen)3](PF6)3, 0.5 M 4-tertpyridine (TBP) and 0.1 M LiTFSI in acetonitrile. For comparison, an iodine electrolyte consisting of 0.25 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI), 0.1 M LiTFSI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M TBP in acetonitrile was formulated.
The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter controlled by a computer and a standard AM 1.5 solar simulator (Oriel 91160-1000 (300 W) Solar Simulator, 2′′ × 2′′ beam). The light intensity was calibrated using an Oriel reference solar cell. A metal mask with an aperture area of 0.25 cm2 was used to cover each cell being tested during all measurements. The action spectra of monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the solar cells were recorded with the use of a commercial setup (QTest Station 2000 IPCE Measurement System, CROWNTECH, USA).

Synthesis of M20. 
To a stirred solution of aldehyde 3 (250 mg, 0.228 mmol) and cyanoacetic acid (51.3 mg, 0.603 mmol) in a 3:7 mixture of chloroform and acetic acid was added a catalytic amount of piperidine (52 μL). The reaction mixture was refluxed for 7 h and then the solvent was removed in vacuo.

All of these dyes have a relatively broad and strong absorption in the ultraviolet and visible regions. The absorption bands at 350–420 nm can be ascribed to the π–π* transitions of the conjugated system, while the bands in the range of 420–600 nm mainly stem from the intramolecular charge-transfer transition (ICT) between donor and acceptor. The major absorption peaks for M4 and M20 are at 506 and 520 nm, respectively. The dye alteration from M4 to M20 has caused a λmax red-shift of 14 nm in addition to enhanced maximum molar absorption coefficients (ε). Note that both dyes have high molar extinction coefficients (over 60000 M−1 cm−1) which ensures excellent light harvesting. It is therefore convenient to use sensitizers in DSCs based on cobalt redox couples, where the use of thinner than usual TiO2 film thicknesses is preferred in order to overcome the mass transport and recombination limitations associated with the polypyridyl cobalt redox shuttles.29
The stronger light harvesting ability of M20 can probably be explained by the fact that the EDOT moiety extends the π-conjugation in the donor section as compared with the truxene-based triarylamine donor of M4. To clarify the electron-donating properties of the EDOT substituted on truxene-based triarylamine in M20, DFT calculations and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations of the excited states were performed. We optimized the molecular structure of M20in vacuo, and the isodensity surface plots of HOMO, HOMO − 1 and LUMO are presented in Fig. 3. The dihedral angle of the truxene-based triarylamine donor and the additional donor (EDOT) is 14.3°, resulting in a more planar conjugation system and thus a red shift of the absorption band as well as enhancement of the molar absorption coefficients.
 Fig. 3  Isodensity surface plots of the HOMO, HOMO − 1 and LUMO of M20. The inset shows the calculated details of electronic transitions with relative oscillator strengths larger than 0.1 for M20. 
The validity of this deduction could be further examined by the TDDFT calculations. Excitation energies and oscillator strengths (f) for M20 are displayed in Fig. 3. The HOMO orbital of M20 is of π-character and is delocalized over the entire molecule, with the maximum components on the truxene-based triarylamine and the EDOT donor. The LUMO orbital is, on the other hand, a single π* orbital delocalized across the EDOT spacer and cyanoacrylic acid groups with sizable contributions from the latter. This distribution of HOMO and LUMO levels clearly demonstrates the electron-donating ability of the EDOT donor. The results indicate that the electrons in the EDOT donor can be successively transferred to the electron acceptor and then injected into the conduction band of TiO2 after being illuminated by light.
Electrochemical properties
To obtain and understand the molecular orbital energy levels, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell with a TiO2 film (3 μm) stained with sensitizer as the working electrode (Fig. 4). The first quasi-reversible one-electron oxidation waves (Eox), taken as the HOMO levels of sensitizers M4 and M20, are calculated to be 1.07 and 0.98 V (vs. NHE), respectively, which are more positive than the [Co(II/III)(phen)3]n+ and I−/I3− redox couples (0.62 V and 0.4 V vs. NHE,2 respectively). Recent studies suggest that a 500 mV driving force is needed for the regeneration of organic sensitizers in the iodide/triiodide electrolyte.2 In this work, the driving forces for dye regeneration of the dyes are larger than 580 mV for the iodine control cells, indicating that the driving forces for dye regeneration are sufficient for the iodine control cells.

In contrast to the large driving forces in iodine cells, the driving forces for dye regeneration in cobalt cells are generally small, resulting in their lower photocurrents. The study of driving forces for dye regeneration in cobalt cells has become a very attractive research topic, and interesting results have been reported by several groups. Yum et al., have reported a cobalt complex using tridendate ligands [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+(PF6)3/2 as a redox mediator in combination with a Y123 dye, yielding a power conversion efficiency of over 10% at 100 mW cm−2.30 It is particularly noteworthy that a dye regeneration yield of 93% was observed, as the difference in the oxidation potential between the dye and the redox couple is only 230 mV. In a study on the effects of driving forces for recombination and regeneration on the photovoltaic performance of DSCs using a cobalt electrolyte, Boschloo proposed that a driving force for dye regeneration of about 390 mV is enough to regenerate more than 80% of the D35 dye molecules in the [Co(Cl-phen)3]3+/2+(PF6)3/2 redox mediator.20 These findings indicate that the driving force is not the only determinant of the dye regeneration. It is likely that the dye regeneration yield is correlated with the ability to retard charge recombination of the dyes. However, more groundwork is needed to clarify this issue in the future. In this work, the calculated driving forces for dye regeneration of M4 and M20 in the cobalt control cells are 450 and 360 mV, respectively. The photocurrent of M20 is slightly higher than that of M4, although the driving force of the former is much lower than that of the latter.
The excited-state oxidation potential (Eox*), reflecting the LUMO level of the dye, can be derived from the ground-state oxidation potential and the zero–zero excitation energy (E0–0), determined from the intersection of the absorption and emission spectra. The Eox* of M4 and M20 (−1.15 and −1.22 V vs. NHE, respectively) are more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 at approximately −0.5 V vs. NHE,2 suggesting that these driving forces are sufficiently large for effective electron injection.
Solar cell performance
The incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the cobalt device with M20 compared to that with M4 is presented in Fig. 5. The IPCE of the M20 cell exceeds 70% in a broad spectrum range from 400 to 580 nm, reaching a maximum of 88%. The onset of the IPCE spectra of the M20 cell is 760 nm, which is red shifted by about 50 nm compared to that of the M4 cell, a result that can be attributed to its extended π-conjugation and planar configuration as a result of the introduction of the EDOT donor moiety.

We further recorded the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics (Fig. 6) of the M4 and M20 cells employing the cobalt electrolyte, to evaluate the substituent effects on the photovoltaic parameters. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. A relatively thin titania film (3 μm) was employed so as to avoid the mass transport limitation of the Co(II/III)(phen)3 redox couple and to minimize interfacial charge recombination. The short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) of the M4 cell measured under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) are 11.4 mA cm−2, 860 mV and 0.68, respectively, affording an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.67%. The use of M20 results in an improved JSC and VOC of 11.8 mA cm−2 and 890 mV, contributing to an evidently enhanced PCE of 7.14%. The key observation here is that a subtle modification of the truxene-based triarylamine donor induces the improvements in JSC and VOC. Note that, in conjunction with the cobalt electrolyte, the photovoltaic performance of M20 is better than that of M1422b (E1, JSC = 11.6 mA cm−2, VOC = 840 mV, FF = 0.71, PCE = 6.92%) bearing a methoxy phenyl group as the donor under the same conditions, further proving the dual effects of EDOT, those being the improvement of the light-harvesting capabilities and retardation of the charge recombination in DSCs.

While long-term stability under thermal and light-soaking stress needs to be addressed in future study, we observed slight decreases in the photocurrent and photovoltage of our cobalt cells when they were left on the lab bench for more than two months. For example, a 0.4 mA cm−2 and 43 mV decrease of JSC and VOC, respectively, was found for a cell comprised of M20 and the E2 electrolyte, which could be attributed to the volatility of acetonitrile.
We have also recorded the J–V curves of the DSCs employing an iodine electrolyte consisting of 0.25 M DMPImI, 0.1 M LiTFSI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M TBP in acetonitrile for comparison (Fig. 6) with the detailed photovoltaic parameters listed in Table 2. A similar trend in JSC and VOC can be found for the iodine dyes. Evidently, the cobalt DSCs outperform the devices based on the conventional iodide/triiodide redox couple. The gain in efficiency is primarily due to a significant increase in VOC, which compensates for the slight drop in JSC.
Interestingly, when carefully comparing the electrolyte correlated JSC variation for the dyes, a distinct difference was observed. It can be found that the 0.4 mA cm−2 increase of JSC caused by the use of the M20 moiety in place of the M4 moiety in cobalt cells (E1 electrolyte) is higher than that observed in iodine cells (0.2 mA cm−2, E5 electrolyte). Moreover, a similar electrolyte correlated performance difference can also be found for VOC. As a result, M20 displayed a distinct increase in efficiency (7.0%) in the cobalt electrolyte system in comparison to M4, in contrast with the slight improvement in efficiency (0.6%) observed in the iodine electrolyte system. These results indicate that the introduction of the EDOT moiety in the donor is preferable in the exploration of organic dyes for iodine-free DSCs.
As is commonly understood, the VOC of a DSC intrinsically represents the difference between the Fermi-level of TiO2 (EF,n) and the Fermi-level of a redox electrolyte (EF,redox), i.e. VOC = EF,redox − EF,n. The EF,n of TiO2 can be expressed as eqn (1)6 (1)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature (293 K in this work), nc is the free electron density and Nc is the density of accessible states in the conduction band. Considering that EF,redox would not change significantly in DSCs with a fixed redox electrolyte, VOC is intimately correlated to ECB and nc. To clarify the VOC performance of the dyes, the relative conduction band positions and electron lifetime of DSCs based on M4 and M20 were investigated.
In this work, charge densities at open-circuit, measured by a charge extraction technique under illumination with green light from an LED,31 were used to compare the conduction band positions in different DSCs. The electron lifetimes at open circuit (τ), measured by controlled intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), can be obtained by fitting either the real or imaginary part of the IMVS response (eqn (2) and (3)).32 (2) (3)where im(ΔVOC) is the imaginary modulation of the photopotential (ΔVOC), re(ΔVOC) is the real modulation of the photopotential (ΔVOC), X1, X2, τre and τim are the fit parameters, and ω is the circular frequency of the light modulation.

Fig. 7a shows the relation between VOC and extracted charge density (Q) at open circuit. The curves for the DSCs based on M4 and M20 are roughly parallel to each other. At a fixed Q, a higher VOC value indicates a negative shift of the CB, while a decreased VOC means a positive shift of the CB. According to the Q–VOC plots, as compared to the M4 cell, the M20 cell showed an upward CB shift of 6 mV, which contributes to the VOC enhancement of 30 mV. Fig. 7b shows the electron lifetime (τ) as a function of Q for the DSCs based on the M4 and M20 moieties. At the same Q, the electron lifetimes of M20 are longer than that of M4, indicating that charge recombination between electrons in the TiO2 film and electron acceptors in the electrolyte are significantly retarded by the EDOT donor.

Dependence of the cell performance on the concentrations of TBP
To achieve the best DSC performance, the content of TBP was firstly optimized for the M4 and M20 sensitized DSCs. Cobalt electrolytes with different concentrations of TBP, featuring stepped increases in TBP concentrations from 0.5 to 1.5 M, were prepared for DSC application. The photovoltaic performances and J–V characteristics of DSCs based on M4 and M20 under AM 1.5 irradiation are given in Table 3 and Fig. 8. The VOC and FF values were obviously improved by increasing the TBP concentration, whereas the JSC value decreased slightly. As a result, the M4 and M20 cells containing 0.8 M TBP gave the best efficiencies of 6.86 and 7.35%, respectively, of all of the investigated cobalt electrolytes.

 Fig. 9  Open circuit as a function of charge density for the studied DSCs with different concentrations of TBP. 
To scrutinize the origin of the VOC variations of dyes in different electrolytes, Q–VOC plots (Fig. 9) and Q–τ plots (Fig. 10) were recorded. Among the different devices, the Q–VOC relation varied within a range of 29 mV (Table 3). For the M4 cells, the presence of 0.8 M, 1.0 M, and 1.5 M TBP caused the TiO2 bands to be shifted upward by about 11, 22 and 29 mV, respectively, as compared to that of 0.5 M TBP. It is clear that the CB shift significantly contributes to the VOC enhancements seen in the devices with high TBP concentrations. Nevertheless, the small CB shifts (all within 29 mV) observed could not explain the large difference in the VOC (which varied within a range of 56 mV) of the different devices. Also, the same trend in VOC is observed for the M20 cells. Fig. 10a and b show the electron lifetime as a function of Q for the M4 and M20 cells. We found that the electron lifetime increased with the increasing concentration of TBP, indicating that charge recombination between electrons in the TiO2 film and Co(III) ions in the electrolyte are significantly retarded by the addition of TBP.
 Fig. 10  Electron lifetime as a function of charge density for the studied DSCs with different concentrations of TBP. 
It is known that, as compared to the iodine control cells, the use of the cobalt electrolyte results in an acceleration of charge recombination at the titania/electrolyte interface, leading to a shorter electron lifetime.22b,29a In the case of cobalt cells, the increases in VOC (around 120 mV) are smaller than expected since the redox potential of 220 mV is higher than that of the iodide/triiodide redox shuttle. It is noted that, even with 1.5 M TBP, the VOC values observed (e.g.M20, 945 mV) are still lower than expected (e.g.M20, 985 mV). The results suggest that the charge recombination at the titania/electrolyte interface is still the key parameter impeding further enhancements in the VOC of DSCs.
In addition to the photovoltage, the variation of TBP concentration also has an impact on the photocurrent of the devices. It is valuable to note that an augmentation of TBP concentration from 0.5 to 0.8 M confers very similar JSC values with devices made with both the M4 and M20 cells. Even with 1.0 M TBP, only a slight decrease in JSC was observed for both devices. Finally, 1.5 M TBP gives rise to significantly decreased JSC. To comprehend the JSC variation, factors contributing to the IPCE need to be considered. IPCE is expressed by the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) and product of absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiency (APCE):33IPCE(λ) = LHE × APCE = LHE × ηcol × ηinjwhere APCE should be divided into two terms; the overall charge collection efficiency (ηcol) and the overall electron injection efficiency (ηinj). Clearly the LHE would not change for cells based on the same dye. Therefore, any difference in the photocurrent among DSCs with the different cobalt electrolytes could be attributed to the differences of ηcol and ηinj. Important factors including the interfacial charge recombination and LUMO levels were discussed to scrutinize the overall charge collection efficiency and the overall electron injection efficiency in DSCs, which could make a critical contribution to the improvement of obtainable IPCE ratios.
As can be seen, for both the M4 and M20 cells, augmentation of the TBP concentration from 0.5 M to 0.8 M does not induce a change in the JSC. Recent study has shown that it is possible for an insufficient driving force for electron injection to induce poor ηinj. The upward shift in the conduction band levels of TiO2 due to the increasing concentration of TBP may result in a decreasing driving force for electron injection. This deduction is consistent with a previous study reported by Koops et al. They found that the electron injection kinetics in DSCs employing the ruthenium bipyridyl sensitizer dye, N719, are strongly dependent upon the concentration of TBP.34 On the other hand, the retardation of charge recombination at the titania/electrolyte interface by increasing the TBP content of the electrolyte leads to an increase in ηcol for cells with both sensitizers. Taking these results into consideration, it is possible that the positive effect of the ηcol enhancement compensates for the adverse impact of the attenuated driving force for electron injection, thus resulting in very small variation of JSC. However, the balance between ηcol and ηinj is perturbed with further increase in TBP concentration, leading to attenuated JSC. Accordingly, we conclude that it is not ηcol, but ηinj that limits the JSC of the M4 and M20 cells with high TBP concentrations.
Conclusions
We have synthesized a new truxene-based arylamine sensitizer, M20, featuring EDOT as the electron donor, for highly efficient iodine-free dye-sensitized solar cells. The introduction of the EDOT moiety in the donor constituent of the truxene dye has dually functioning effects, those being improvement of the light-harvesting capabilities and retardation of the charge recombination in DSCs. In conjunction with the cobalt electrolyte, M20 sensitized DSCs afford a short circuit photocurrent of 11.8 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 903 mV, and a fill factor of 0.69, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 7.35% under standard AM 1.5 sunlight, which is much higher than that of the 6.86% observed in M4 sensitized DSCs. The VOC and FF values for DSCs based on M4 and M20 were obviously improved by increasing the concentration of TBP in the electrolyte, whereas the JSC values decreased slightly. Consequently, the M4 and M20 cells containing 0.8 M TBP gave the best efficiencies of 6.86 and 7.35%, respectively, among all of the cobalt electrolytes. Analysis of the charge density and electron lifetime data have revealed that an increase of TBP content in the electrolyte results in elevations of the titania CB as well as suppression of charge recombination, accounting for a significant photovoltage enhancement. On the other hand, the attenuated JSC of the M4 and M20 cells with increasing TBP concentration can be attributed to the decreased ηinj. The information provided will be useful for the future rational design of sterically bulky organic dyes for application in high-efficiency iodine-free DSCs.
