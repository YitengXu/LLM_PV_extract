    , Accepted 13th May 2016First published on 16th May 2016AbstractUsing a pneumatic spray gun for a long-distance jet, we coated thioacetamide on the surface of ZnO. Thus, the adsorption capacity of N719 dyes greatly increased. The as-samples were characterised by linear sweep voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis. Results showed that the charge recombination resistance increased, which lowered the interface electron recombination rate between ZnO and the electrolyte and between the electrolyte and the dye. Finally, a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 8.28 ± 0.24% for ZnO-based dye-sensitized solar cells was achieved.
Introduction
Grätzel firstly introduced dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) in 1991.1 DSSCs have attracted worldwide attention as a clean energy source because of their unique advantages such as low energy consumption, low fabrication costs, fairly high solar energy conversion efficiency and a simple preparation process.2 To date, the most efficient DSSCs have reached an efficiency of 13% using a molecularly engineered porphyrin dye with TiO2 nanoparticles.3 As an alternative to TiO2, the rate of electron transport in ZnO is faster than that in TiO2 besides other advantages of an easier preparation process, controllable conditions and environmental friendliness.4–9 The photovoltaic conversion efficiency of ZnO-based DSSCs has significantly improved from 0.4%10 in 1994 to 8.03%11 in 2013, which proves its research value and provides encouragement for further study.12–15
Compared with TiO2, the limitations of ZnO-based DSSCs are mainly attributed to low electron injection efficiency (ϕinj), low dye absorbing efficiency and poor dye adsorption capacity.2,9,15–17 The dye adsorption capacity is a key factor to the conversion efficiency by directly affecting the number of electrons that are excited by light. In ZnO-based DSSCs, the acid dyes can react with the ZnO surface, forming Zn2+ complexes that are incapable of injecting electrons into the ZnO conduction band.18,19 Moreover, N719, one of the most commonly used dyes, which has been reported in many research papers or review articles, contains a great deal of oxygen functional groups.20
In the present paper, we report surface modification as a simple but effective method for reducing the reaction between ZnO and dyes and increasing the adsorption of organic dyes by enhancing the polarity of the ZnO surface to form strong hydrogen bonds with oxygen functional groups. Surface modification of ZnO has been used in many fields.21–26 However, studies in the field of DSSCs are limited. Thus, we introduced a simple surface modification agent, thioacetamide (TAA), to treat the surface of ZnO for highly efficient DSSCs. TAA is a low-molecular-weight substance that contains H and strongly electronegative atoms with a lone electron pair (N and S). When in aqueous solution, the hydrolysis product of TAA can react with ZnO to form the initial ZnS shell on its surface.27 However, when containing a bit of water and in neutral solution, the product can be coated on the surface of ZnO, forming strong hydrogen bonds with oxygen functional groups in N719. Using a pneumatic spray gun for a long-distance jet, a water spray was formed and eventually evaporated, and we successfully obtained an efficiency of 8.28 ± 0.24% by coating TAA on the surface of ZnO. For the TAA-coated-ZnO photoanodes, our finding was important for revealing the notable effect of surface modification on the final photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.
Experimental section
Surface modification of zinc oxide
All reagents were directly used without any purification and were of analytical grade. The solid-state synthesis of the precursor of Zn(OH)2 nanostructures was performed as described in our previous report.2 Powders of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and NaOH were placed in an agate mortar and ground at room temperature for 30 min. After adding 100 mL of distilled water, the products were centrifuged to remove Na+ and excess alkali. The precipitate was dispersed into 50 mL of deionised water by ultrasonic irradiation. The slurry was achieved after repeating the two steps for three times. Subsequently, we used the doctor blade technique to uniformly spread a small amount of slurry onto the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass.28 After drying, the sample was annealed at 250 °C for 2 h at a ramping rate of 1 °C min−1. Using a pneumatic spray gun (Mini airbrush, Royalmax 0.3 mm, Shenchao Machinery, China), the solution of 0.2 M TAA was evenly sprayed on the zinc oxide film under a pressure of 3 Bar and at a spraying distance of 40 cm. The spraying amount was represented by the capacity of the TAA solution sprayed per square centimeter. The spraying amounts were set at 2.22, 4.44 and 8.89 mL cm−2 to obtain TAA with different mass percentages and named as ZnO-x, where x denotes mass percent. The sample was finally dried in air at 90 °C for 6 h. In this study, four samples and cells were prepared under the same conditions.
Cell assembly and photovoltaic performance
A photoanode (5 mm × 5 mm) was subsequently sensitised using a 0.5 mM Ruthenizer 535-bisTBA (N719) in absolute ethanol solution at 45 °C for 100 min to confirm that it was completely attached by dye molecules. The sample was then carefully cleaned with wiping paper and washed with ethanol to remove the unabsorbed dye before drying under a vacuum at room temperature. A platinised-sputtered FTO counter (PMC-5000 plasma multicoater) was used as the counter electrode. The redox electrolyte consisted of 0.06 M LiI, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate. All chemicals were purchased from OPV Tech Co. Ltd. Finally, DSSCs were fabricated by assembling the electrolyte-dropped photoanode and the counter electrode as a sandwich structure.
Characterization of properties
Morphologies and structures of ZnO products were characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; S-4800, Hitachi, Japan). Phase identification was characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD; M18XCE, Bruker, Germany) using Cu Kα radiation at 3 kW. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of ZnO-x were recorded using a surface area analyser (ASAP 2020 Analyser, Micromeritics, USA). UV-vis spectra were obtained using a UV-365 spectrophotometer. Photocurrent–voltage curves (J–V curves) were measured by linear sweep voltammetry at an electrochemical workstation (CHF-XM-500 W, Beijing Changtuo Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) under the AM 1.5 standard (100 mW cm−2) irradiation. The total active area of our DSSCs was 0.25 cm2. The light intensity was calibrated using a standard Si photodiode detector (CEL-RCCN, Beijing Zhongjiaojinyuan Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was conducted at an electrochemical workstation (IM6, ZAHNER) in the dark with an AC signal of 20 mV in amplitude, and the swept frequency range was from 100 mHz to 100 kHz. Spectra analysis was performed using Z-view modelling software. In addition, for each sample, we fabricated three DSSC devices, taking the average as the final result in the manuscript.
Results and discussion
The DSSCs were assembled by using ZnO which was dipped in dye N719 as the photoanode and the Pt electrode as the counter electrode, shown as Scheme 1. The phase analysis was carried out on the ZnO/TAA anode after spraying, and then the performance of the assembled cell was tested.

According to Fig. 1(c), XRD patterns after surface modification showed no difference from those of pure ZnO in the peak shape. The characteristic XRD peak of TAA could not be observed because the amount of TAA (4.44 mL cm−2) was below the XRD detection limit and TAA was an amorphous material. In order to illustrate the existence of TAA, samples were tested by HRTEM, and as can be seen from Fig. 1(d and e), results showed clearly that the amorphous TAA was covered on the surface of ZnO after spraying.

In addition, we measured the FT-IR spectrum of the samples before and after spraying. It is observed from Fig. 2 that, besides the characteristic peaks of ZnO, which were in the regions of 3300–3600 cm−1 (ν(OH)), at 1630 cm−1 (δ(OH)) and at 1385 cm−1 (δ(OH)),29 two absorption peaks at 1134 and 1108 cm−1 appeared after spraying. These two peaks were most likely generated by the stretching vibration interaction between the two groups of CS and N–H bonds. Combined with HRTEM characterizations, TAA was thought to be successfully adsorbed on the ZnO surface after spraying.

To reveal the influence of surface modification on ZnO photoanode films, we performed the analysis on dye loading by desorbing dye molecules in 0.1 M NaOH ethanol–water (molar ratio 1:1) solution and then performed measurement using a UV-vis spectrophotometer. The spraying amounts were set as 0, 2.22, 4.44 and 8.89 mL cm−2 to obtain TAA with different mass percentages and named as ZnO-x, where x denotes the mass percent. For example, ZnO-2.22 denotes a spraying amount of 2.22 mL cm−2. It should be pointed out that the spraying amount was controlled by weighing the quality of the zinc oxide film attached with FTO before and after the spraying process. Fig. 3(A) showed strong absorption peaks at about 515 nm, and the absorbance of ZnO-2.22, ZnO-4.44, ZnO-8.89 and pure ZnO was 0.103, 0.147 0.127 and 0.060, respectively. It can be seen that ZnO-4.44 clearly showed the highest absorbance compared with the others in this study. However, the absorbance of ZnO-8.89 dramatically decreased, which was mainly because excessive TAA would reduce the specific surface area of zinc oxide. Compared with pure ZnO, TAA increased the absorbance by forming intermolecular forces with N719, and the phenomenon of blue-shift of the peaks caused by hydrogen bonds can be observed through the ultraviolet absorption spectra (Fig. 3(B)).30

We used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to characterise and analyse the electric behaviours of the four samples in the DSSCs. Data under lower bias (0.5 V) were obtained and are shown in Fig. 4. The high-frequency semiarc is related to the counter electrode material. The low-frequency arc includes charge transfer or recombination resistance between ZnO/TAA and N719/electrolyte (Rrec).31 After carefully analysing and fitting the EIS results, we obtained the charge recombination resistance of ZnO (see Table 1). The results indicated the larger charge recombination with the increase in the spraying amount, which increased Voc because of the separation of carriers on the surface between ZnO and the electrolyte and between the electrolyte and the dye. In addition, the charge transfer resistances in the ZnO film (Rtr) before and after spraying showed little difference when the spraying amount was less, while when the spraying amount of TAA reached 8.89 mL cm−2, the Rtr showed a rapid increase, which might be caused due to the fact that too much TAA on the surface hindered the transmission of electrons to some extent. Moreover, electrons can be transmitted along hydrogen bonds,32 so when the hydrogen bonds on the surface of ZnO and carboxyl in N719 formed between TAA and hydroxyl, the number of electrons increased because they could be transmitted across hydrogen bonds more rapidly and smoothly, and electronic recombination was reduced, leading to improved Jsc.

J–V curves of the samples are displayed in Fig. 5, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. Jsc and Voc of the three novel samples were apparently enhanced, and the corresponding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) were 8.08 ± 0.18, 8.28 ± 0.24 and 7.59 ± 0.16%. The higher Jsc value after spraying was mainly due to the increase of the adsorption of N719 caused by the TAA on the surface of ZnO. From the perspective of the photoconversion efficiency, the satisfactory performances of the three novel samples were thought to be related to charge recombination and the number of electrons. Finally, with the low temperature-treated photoanode films, when the spraying amount reached 4.44 mL cm−2, our devices achieved enhanced PCEs of up to 8.28 ± 0.24%.

Conclusion
We investigated the influence of surface modification of ZnO on the efficiency of DSSCs. Furthermore, using a simple but effective method, spraying to treat the ZnO film, we successfully reduced the electron transfer resistance and improved the transmission speed, thereby restraining carrier recombination and increasing the adsorption of organic dyes. Finally, we achieved enhanced power conversion efficiencies of 8.28 ± 0.24% for pure ZnO-based dye-sensitized solar cells for a photoelectrode. Compared with other methods to treat ZnO, our approach is undoubtedly novel, facile, simple and fast. We are quite optimistic to forecast that this approach is applicable to other morphologies of ZnO.
