, Accepted 23rd July 2013First published on 23rd July 2013AbstractUsing impedance spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the low fill factor (FF) typically observed in small molecule solar cells is due to hindered carrier transport through the active layer and hindered charge transfer through the anode interfacial layer (IFL). By carefully tuning the active layer thickness and anode IFL in BDT(TDPP)2 solar cells, the FF is increased from 33 to 55% and the PCE from 1.9 to 3.8%. These results underscore the importance of simultaneously optimizing active layer thickness and IFL in small molecule solar cells.
1. Introduction
Rapid material developments in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) research have led to impressive performance advances, with confirmed power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) now reaching ∼10%.1 In BHJ cells, interpenetrating networks of donor and acceptor molecules/macromolecules harvest sunlight and generate charge carriers that are collected at selective electrodes.2 Most research to date has focused on polymeric donors and fullerene molecular acceptors.3,4 Recent progress in solution-processed small donor molecule BHJ OPVs, however, has highlighted the potential to overcome many of the synthetic and processing challenges associated with polymeric donors.5–18 Nevertheless, for the majority of small molecule donor OPVs, conspicuously low fill factors (FFs) are observed, and further mechanistic understanding will be required to improve efficiencies. In this contribution, we seek better understanding of why devices fabricated with small molecule donors typically exhibit lower FFs than their polymeric analogues and how this disparity might be rectified.
The approach here is to understand these differences by comparing the properties of OPVs fabricated with the well-studied polymeric donor–acceptor system poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):PC61BM, which consistently yields FFs ≥ 65%,19 with a small molecule donor–acceptor system that typically provides low FFs. Using impedance spectroscopy (IS) we identify additional resistances for the small molecule system which are not observed in the polymer system. We show that these additional resistive effects severely limit FFs in the small molecule OPVs and arise from losses related to both charge transport within the active layer blend and charge transfer from the active layer to the anode interfacial layer (IFL). By careful optimization of the active layer thickness and anode IFL, we demonstrate that the additional resistances in the impedance spectra can be significantly suppressed and device performance significantly enhanced. We show that the impedance spectroscopy analysis can also be applied to other higher efficiency small molecule systems.
2. Results and discussion
This study utilizes a new small molecule donor BDT(TDPP)2-6,6′-(5,5′-(4,8-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithio-phene-2,6-diyl)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3-(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-4(2H,5H)-dione) abbreviated as BDT (Fig. 1; see ESI† for the synthesis). Previous results showed that fused acene small molecule cores flanked by thiophene-capped diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) units provide excellent light capture and high ionization potentials (IPs), thus yielding excellent OPV short circuit current densities (Jsc) and open circuit voltages (Voc) similar to those reported previously for z-NDT(TDPP)2 (Fig. 1).20,21

Optimized BDT:PC61BM OPVs having the architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Ag afford the performance parameters Jsc = 10.0 mA cm−2 and Voc = 0.81 V, which are significantly greater than those of an optimized P3HT:PC61BM OPV (Fig. 2a; Table 1 entries 1 and 2). Strikingly, however, the P3HT device FF is significantly greater (67%) than that of the BDT device (37%), which is similar to that of most solution-processed small molecule OPVs.7 The reasons can be partly understood from microstructural and hole mobility analysis.8 Next, AFM analysis is carried out on the P3HT:PC61BM and BDT:PC61BM films (Fig. S4, ESI†). Compared to the small molecule system, the P3HT:PC61BM films have larger domains with more fibrillar regions, suggesting better electrical connectivity. Interestingly, comparing the AFM images of a recently reported high efficiency (7.38%) small molecule device18 with those reported for BDT:PC61BM shows them to be rather similar, indicating that microcrystallinity alone, as inferred from AFM images, is insufficient to account for the lower FF. It will be seen here that impedance spectroscopy (IS) reveals that the small molecule TDPP system is indeed limited by carrier transport.

To shed more light on the origin of the low small molecule FFs, an impedance spectroscopy (IS) analysis was carried out on the P3HT:PC61BM and BDT:PC61BM OPVs. IS techniques have proven to be powerful tools for quantifying OPV recombination rates.22,23 Here, a small AC voltage perturbation is applied at varying DC voltage biases and the differential current output measured. The AC voltage frequency is then varied to analyze the differential current response, with the measurements carried out as a function of DC voltage to encompass the entire OPV operating regime.
IS spectra of the P3HT:PC61BM and BDT:PC61BM OPVs are compared in Fig. 2b and c (devices 1 and 2). There is a striking difference in the spectra, which will be shown to correlate with the large differences in device FF. The methods for OPV IS measurement interpretation have been explained in a number of review and research papers. Here we only briefly summarize the significance of key parameters and refer the reader to the previous papers for a full account of the interpretation tools.24–26 In many cases it has been observed that when doping an organic blend (donor density ND), so that it contains a stable population of majority electronic carriers (holes in the donor material) of density p = ND, the open circuit voltage is associated with the rise of the minority carrier Fermi level (electrons in the fullerene), and is determined by the recombination flux (Jrec). These features provide a simple IS model consisting of the parallel combination of recombination resistance Rrec and chemical capacitance Cμ. The capacitance Cμ indexes the ability of the system to store minority carriers (electrons)25 due to the rise of the electron Fermi level in the fullerene phase. It has been shown that when EFn is deliberately displaced, the chemical capacitance provides an accurate measure of the density of states (DOS) on the fullerene.24 On the other hand, the recombination resistance is defined as22,23 
(1)The recombination flux Jrec can then be expressed in terms of the density of minority carrier electrons, n, as 
Jrec = qLkrecnβ
(2)where q is the elementary charge, L is the film thickness, and krec is a constant. In a solar cell controlled only by recombination which does not exhibit transport or series resistance limitations, using the Boltzmann statistics (kBT is thermal energy) in eqn (2) we can write the diode model as follows: 
(3)where j0 stands for the saturation current and jph accounts for the photocurrent. The parameter β represents an effective recombination order that directly translates into the diode quality factor, and therefore determines the shape of the diode curve and the FF. Additionally other factors may limit the solar cell performance, and they appear as additional resistances that decrease the fill factor and eventually the photocurrent. The total resistance measured by IS is related to the derivative of the J–V plot (at any voltage) as, 
(4)In IS analysis the resistance Rrec can be separated from other resistive contributions. For the model of eqn (2) we have, 
(5)The voltage VF represents the rise in the electron Fermi level, and is derived by subtracting the series potential drop from the applied voltage, Vapp.
The characteristic features of the simple impedance model are often observed in the P3HT:PC61BM devices.24 Accordingly the IS response of this device shows a single arc (Fig. 2c), which can be interpreted in terms of Rrec and Cμ which correspond to elements R1 and C1 in the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 2b (inset). The behaviour of R1 for the P3HT:PC61BM device (Fig. 2d) indicates an exponential decrease with the voltage between 0.3 V and Voc, and can be attributed to Rrec as shown in eqn (5).22,23 This interpretation of the P3HT:PC61BM device data is further corroborated by the behaviour of the capacitance C1, which increases exponentially with voltage as a standard chemical capacitance.24
In contrast to this standard behaviour, the BDT:PC61BM OPV shows an additional feature that consists of a second arc at high frequency, Fig. 2c. The circuit required to fit these small molecule impedance spectra consists of two additional elements R2 and C2 (Fig. 2c, inset). Assuming that the low frequency resistor R1 can be interpreted as Rrec and defines the diode shape, the high frequency resistor R2 represents an absolute loss of the photogenerated power. According to eqn (2) the additional R2 increases the reciprocal of ∂J/∂V and therefore flattens the J–V curve and depresses the FF, as discussed above. Rtot also includes a series resistance, Rs, corresponding to the high frequency intercept of the IS spectrum, which arises from the contacts and substrates.
In a more detailed analysis, it can be seen in Fig. 2d that for BDT:PC61BM, R1 does decrease exponentially as Rrec, but only up to a certain voltage which is denoted here as the threshold voltage (Vth). Thereafter, R1 increases with voltage instead of the expected decrease. This feature is accompanied by a leveling off of Cμ, indicating that the electron Fermi level no longer spans the DOS of the fullerene, i.e., EFn does not rise into the bandgap despite the voltage increase. This is a direct consequence of the presence of two electrical processes connected in series in which recombination is dominant at low applied voltages and interfacial charge transfer at high applied voltages. Thus, understanding the physical origin of both resistances R1 and R2 that severely limit the PCE of BDT:PC61BM OPVs is essential.
To this end, in the next stage of the investigation, the active layer thickness of the BDT-based devices was systematically varied from 40 nm to 110 nm, using a PEDOT:PSS IFL as the standard contact. The results for the three cells are shown in Fig. 3 (devices 3–5). The principal aim of changing the active layer thickness is to distinguish, in the IS spectra, between physical phenomena occurring in the bulk blend which depend on volume, and those occurring at the macroscopic contacts. For example, the total rate of recombination in organic BHJ blends depends on volume and should scale with thickness. Reducing the active layer thickness should suppress recombination, and therefore enhance Voc, if the total generation rate is the same.27–30 On the other hand, light absorption and carrier generation, which determine Jsc, should increase with thickness. Indeed the Jsc of the 65 nm BDT:PC61BM device is greater than that of the device with an active layer thickness of 45 nm. However, a further increase in active layer thickness to 110 nm leads to reduced charge collection, and a very low quality device. An important fact evident in Fig. 3a is that Voc is invariant across the series of active layer thicknesses. A related behaviour, in which Voc is nearly invariant with respect to the illumination level, was reported by Zhang et al.31 for a similar type of device. The J–V response also reveals that the device with the thinnest active layer has the highest FF, which noticeably falls with increasing active layer thickness (Table 1, entries 3–5).

(c) Fitting results for the same devices. Vth indicates the approximate threshold at which R1 changes tendency. 
Deeper insight into these features in the BDT:PC61BM J–V curves comes from interpreting the impedance results. A clear correlation between the active layer thickness and the resistance of the high frequency arc (R2) is evident (Fig. 3b and c). The BDT:PC61BM device with the thinnest active layer exhibits the smallest resistance R2 (10–30 Ω cm2) and this resistance scales with the active layer thickness, i.e. 100 Ω cm2 for the thickest cell (entry 5). Additionally, the capacitance associated with this arc falls as the active layer thicknesses are increased, which is expected from the dielectric capacitance associated with the film geometric capacitance.25 This thickness dependence indicates that R2 can be ascribed to a transport resistance (Rtr).32 Since this resistance is coupled to the geometric capacitance (and not to the chemical capacitance as previously shown for systems based on P3HT:PC61BM), we assume that the Rtr is related to majority carriers (holes).11 Note that well-separated IS arcs over the entire operating voltage range are only observed for cells having an active layer thickness of 110 nm. As the active layer thickness is decreased, the voltage at which the two arcs are observed increases. Note also that the presence of a high frequency arc was recently observed by IS in polymer-based OPVs when carrier transport was deliberatively reduced by introducing traps.33 The thinnest active layer exhibits the smallest, least defined additional arc, thus connecting active layer thickness and bulk active layer charge transport with device FF. The results in Fig. 3 show that when the active layer thickness is reduced to 40 nm, the loss in PCE resulting from the FF is greatly suppressed, and FFs of 49% are achievable – significantly higher than the 32% measured for the 110 nm active layer OPV.
Concerning the resistance of the low frequency arc, which is connected with the recombination resistance that exists in all solar cells, as indicated in eqn (1), Fig. 3c shows the same behaviour identified in Fig. 2 for the three different thickness devices: below the threshold voltage Vth, R1 decreases with increasing voltage as is typical for Rrec and, as expected, this resistance scales with thickness. Rrec can be analyzed in terms of the effective recombination order (β) that is connected with the diode quality and determines the shape of the J–V curve, as indicated in eqn (2) and (5).34 High values of β provide high FFs. In good agreement with this rule, values of β calculated for P3HT:PC61BM from eqn (5) show the highest β value obtained in this work (β = 0.51, FF = 67%), the lowest recombination rates, and the highest FF. On the other hand, β values for the BDT:PC61BM system are smaller, indicating higher recombination rates and lower FFs than those of the polymeric analogue. See for example, Table 1 entries 3 (β = 0.40, FF = 49%) and 4 (β = 0.35, FF = 42%).
At a threshold voltage Vth, the R1 parameter becomes completely pinned. Fig. 3c also shows clearly that both Vth and the value of R1 at V > Vth are independent of thickness. This result strongly links this pinned resistance with the macroscopic contact since the electrical response of processes occurring in the bulk of the active layer would depend on its thickness.
To further investigate the impedance spectroscopic features with the overall goal of enhancing small molecule OPV FFs, the anode IFL was varied. IFLs have been recently implemented to adjust OPV energy level alignment, enhance physical cohesion, and block minority carrier leakage at the active layer-anode interface, thereby significantly enhancing PCE and durability.35–37 Nevertheless, a recent small molecule OPV review indicates that this strategy has barely influenced the field.7 Analysis of data reviewed by Mishra et al. shows that of over 100 different small molecule donors that have been investigated in OPVs (average FF = 39%), only six were examined with a non-PEDOT:PSS IFL.
An effective OPV IFL must ensure good energy level matching with the appropriate charge carriers, e.g., the electron affinity (EA) of the electron transporting material with the cathode IFL,38,39 and the IP of the hole transporting material with the anode IFL.40–43 By cyclic voltammetry, the BDT IP is found to be large, 5.5 eV, whereas the P3HT IP lies at 5.2 eV (see ESI†). These values can be used, as an approximation, to provide information on the energy level alignment of the active layer and the anode as shown in Fig. 4. Thus, the optimal anode IFL (PEDOT:PSS) for P3HT is unlikely to be optimum for BDT due to energetic mismatches, and such mismatches are probably the origin of the increased resistances of the low frequency arc as Voc is approached in BDT:PC61BM OPVs. To this end, the optimized BDT:PC61BM active layer film thickness (∼40 nm) was investigated with three different IFL materials, Fig. 5, all having distinctly different WFs: PEDOT:PSS dried in air (5.2 eV),44 already discussed PEDOT:PSS dried under N2 (5.4 eV),44 and thermally evaporated MoO3 exposed to air (5.5 eV).45,46

The IFL anode is modified to test the importance of the energy level matching at the active layer/anode interface; the IFLs are air-dried PEDOT:PSS and thermally evaporated MoO3 exposed to air. Device 9 is based on a higher efficiency small molecule donor (z-NDT) in the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/z-NDT:PC61BM/Ca/Ag, (b) J–V response of hole only-diodes based on the architecture: ITO/IFL/BDT (50 nm)/Au, where the IFL is either MoO3 (5 nm) or PEDOT:PSS (dried in the glovebox). (c) Impedance spectra of devices shown in (a) measured at 1 sun illumination at Voc. (d) Fitting results for the same devices. Vth indicates the approximate threshold at which R1 changes tendency. 
Using the air-dried PEDOT:PSS IFL, the BDT OPV J–V plot clearly exhibits a dramatically reduced FF and lower photovoltage compared to PEDOT:PSS dried in the glovebox, while Jsc is unchanged (Fig. 5a and Table 1, entries 3, 6 and 7). The thermally evaporated MoO3 IFL thickness was then optimized, and optimum results were obtained from a 5 nm thick film (Table 1, entry 7; see ESI† for details). The optimized devices show Jsc and Voc values comparable to those of the PEDOT:PSS glovebox-dried OPV. However, more importantly, the FF is significantly enhanced for all MoO3-based devices – up to a 67% increase versus the air-dried PEDOT:PSS IFL and a 15% increase versus the glovebox-dried PEDOT:PSS IFL. Upon optimizing the active layer thickness, PCE = 3.8% is achieved using the 5 nm MoO3 IFL (entry 8). Note that regardless of the IFL used, the BDT:PC61BM active layer morphology appears to be identical on each substrate (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†), as revealed by AFM and XRD analysis, which confirms that the morphology of the active layer is neither affected by the IFL choice, nor does the morphology influence the large observed enhancement in FF when changing from an air-dried PEDOT:PSS IFL to a MoO3 IFL.
Additionally, J–V curves corresponding to hole-only diodes (see Fig. 5b) constructed in the architecture ITO/IFL/BDT/Au, where the IFL is either PEDOT:PSS (glovebox dried) or MoO3, confirm that the MoO3 has superior hole-transfer properties than PEDOT:PSS. Hole injection is clearly enhanced as observed in the current onset occurring at low bias voltages. This likely reflects the energetically favourable alignment between BDT and MoO3.
Summarizing the IS results for the BDT:PC61BM devices with different IFLs, a striking result is that the MoO3 IFL containing device exhibits no high frequency arc (Fig. 5c and d) related to majority carrier transport limitations. In contrast, both PEDOT:PSS IFL devices exhibit the additional arc at high frequencies (Table 1 entries 6 and 7) of comparable magnitude (see R2 in Fig. 5d). Remarkably, all three devices have the same active layer thickness and only devices having an energy level mismatch between anode workfunction and the donor molecule IP exhibit this additional resistance (Fig. 5c). The time constant of this additional process is of the same order of magnitude as that observed for recombination processes and, hence, no additional arc is observed.
Recall that the above interpretation of the IS data suggests that Rtr relates to hole transport while Rrec is determined by minority carrier electron recombination. Fig. 5d reveals that bulk transport resistance R2 and carrier extraction at the hole selective contact are strongly correlated phenomena that also produce a large effect on recombination resistance. The actual mechanism that correlates charge extraction of holes by the IFL and transport in the bulk is not yet totally understood. However, we have previously shown for a system in which the electron collecting contact was blocked that the observed transport properties are distinctly different from those at an efficiently collecting contact.32 Increased device thickness leads to increased Rtr and a reduction in Rrec at lower voltages than in the case of the thinnest active layer. Based on these observations we suggest that the bulk dominated transport and recombination features (Rtr and Rrec) are influenced by the charge transfer rate at the hole selective contact, as indicated schematically in Fig. 4. The failure to extract holes in the case of poor hole-selective contacts also argues that greater driving force is needed for hole transport in the blend, which is evident in the IS measurements as large Rtr values. In turn, this translates into a reduction in the device FF. Furthermore, while carriers generated close to the hole-selective contact can still be collected, those generated closer to the opposite selective contact are more difficult to extract and in turn decrease the recombination resistance. While in the case of the good performance MoO3 contact, it is observed that the absence of carrier transport limitations (no second arc) also removes the pinning of the recombination resistance that displays an exponentially decreasing behavior up to high voltage, similar to the near ideal behavior of the P3HT:PC61BM solar cell.
To emphasize the importance of energy level alignment, a different, recently published DPP derivative (z-NDT, Fig. 1)20 was also examined. OPVs based on z-NDT:PC61BM provide PCE of 4.3% using an optimized thickness and the IFL air-dried PEDOT:PSS (Table 1, entry 9). Surprisingly, the FF is relatively high (FF = 48%) and raises the question why in this case the same IFL that showed a reduction in FF for BDT shows good performance for z-NDT. The answer is jointly found taking into account both the z-NDT IP energy and the impedance spectroscopy response. A IP energy of 5.2 eV (see ESI† for CV measurements) ensures an adequate energy level matching with PEDOT:PSS dried in air. Furthermore, the impedance response shows again two arcs. Only the low frequency of arc (R1) only decreases as Voc is approached, which is the typical behavior of pure Rrec (Fig. 5d). Therefore, this result suggests that the PEDOT:PSS dried in air does not manifest any charge transfer impediments as otherwise R1 would increase close to Voc. Alternatively, C1 exponentially increases as expected for well-aligned energy levels. This final result may explain why other small molecule systems found in the literature are able to provide high efficiencies using PEDOT:PSS IFLs.8,18 However, in the z-NDT:PC61BM system, the high frequency arc (R2) related to issues of carrier transport is still present and β is low with a value of 0.30. For z-NDT:PC61BM these two factors are ultimately responsible for the relatively low FF.
3. Conclusions
In this investigation of why BDT-based, and, by extrapolation, many other small molecule donor OPVs typically exhibit low FFs, a range of characterization techniques yields two important observations: (1) BDT:PC61BM small molecule OPV performance is severely limited by carrier transport within the bulk, and low active layer thicknesses are required to minimize recombination processes and maximize OPV performance, (2) energy level mismatches between the donor IP and the anode IFL WF also significantly limit OPV performance by suppressing hole injection from the active layer to the anode. Replacing the widely-used PEDOT:PSS IFL (WF = 5.2 eV) with MoO3 (WF = 5.5 eV) affords a better energetic match with the BDT IP (5.5 eV), and the corresponding OPV FFs and PCEs are dramatically enhanced. Both phenomena are highly correlated as evidenced by impedance spectroscopy. Thus, IFL optimization should always be carried out, taking into account the donor IP energy.

 	Fig. 3  (a) J–V response of small molecule donor OPVs using the standard device architecture: ITO/IFL/BDT:PC61BM/Ca/Ag. The effect of active layer thickness is studied with IFL = PEDOT:PSS dried under N2. (b) Impedance spectra of devices shown in (a) measured at 1 sun illumination at Voc. (c) Fitting results for the same devices. Vth indicates the approximate threshold at which R1 changes tendency.	 

 	Fig. 4  Energy level diagram showing the materials studied in this work and an estimation of the energy level match–mismatch between the hole transporting active material and the IFL.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) J–V response of small molecule donor OPVs using the standard device architecture: ITO/IFL/BDT:PC61BM/Ca/Ag. The IFL anode is modified to test the importance of the energy level matching at the active layer/anode interface; the IFLs are air-dried PEDOT:PSS and thermally evaporated MoO3 exposed to air. Device 9 is based on a higher efficiency small molecule donor (z-NDT) in the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/z-NDT:PC61BM/Ca/Ag, (b) J–V response of hole only-diodes based on the architecture: ITO/IFL/BDT (50 nm)/Au, where the IFL is either MoO3 (5 nm) or PEDOT:PSS (dried in the glovebox). (c) Impedance spectra of devices shown in (a) measured at 1 sun illumination at Voc. (d) Fitting results for the same devices. Vth indicates the approximate threshold at which R1 changes tendency.
