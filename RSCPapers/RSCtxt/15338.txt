    , Accepted 19th April 2017First published on 21st April 2017AbstractPhotodetectors (PDs), especially those that respond in the infrared region, are highly desirable and have a wide range of applications ranging from cell phones, cameras, and home electronics to airplanes and satellites. Herein, we designed and fabricated PDs based on air-stable α-CsPbI3 QDs and an up-conversion material (NaYF4:Yb,Er QDs) using a facial low temperature spin-coating method. When the α-CsPbI3 QDs are surface-modified using NaYF4:Yb,Er QDs, their optical response is extended to the NIR region to allow broadband application from the UV to visible to NIR region (260 nm–1100 nm). The optoelectronic properties and compositional stability of the devices were also studied in detail. From the results, the PDs are capable of broad-bandwidth photodetection from the deep UV to NIR region (260 nm–1100 nm) with good photoresponsivity (R, 1.5 A W−1), high on/off ratio (up to 104) and very short rise/decay time (less than 5 ms/5 ms). It was found that the photoresponsivity performance of the PDs in this work is better than that of all the other previously reported perovskite QD-based PDs with a lateral device structure. Furthermore, the device performance shows very little degradation over the course of 60 days of storage under ambient conditions. The combination of remarkable stability, high performance broad-bandwidth photodetection, and easy fabrication suggest that these QDs are a very promising semiconducting candidate for optoelectronic applications.
Introduction
Broad-bandwidth photodetectors (PDs) have a wide range of applications ranging from cell phones, cameras, and home electronics to airplanes and satellites.1–3 There has been tremendous research efforts to develop advanced broad-bandwidth (UV-Vis-NIR) PDs in recent years.4–6 However, traditional semiconductor (Si, CdTe, and GaAs)-based PDs usually have complicated structures with stringent demands for high quality materials, which in turn require sophisticated high-temperature fabrication processes.7–9 It is imperative to develop low-cost, high performance semiconductor materials for next generation PDs.10–12
For this purpose, organic lead-halide-based perovskites stand out as a class of promising materials due to their strong light absorption, weakly bound excitons, long range charge carrier diffusion, apparent tolerance to defects13–15 and straightforward low-temperature (<120 °C) low-cost fabrication.16–19 In fact, the performance of perovskite PDs has been improved to a high level comparable with that of commercial silicon devices.20–22 Unfortunately, the poor stability of perovskite devices remains an obstruction for their large scale commercialization.23 Their vulnerability to moisture, ambient conditions and UV light prevent them from long term deployment in real applications.24,25 As a matter of fact, Burschka found that the perovskite device has the best performance if fabricated under atmospheric conditions with relative humidity <1%.26 Nie and Divitini found that in optoelectronic materials, the organic groups are inherently less stable under irradiation and thermal stress.27,28 It is therefore necessary to develop stable perovskite materials for high-performance PDs.
Fortunately, inorganic CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) perovskites are emerging, which possess superior properties, including high carrier mobility, long carrier diffusion length, and excellent light absorption, and they are more stable than hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites.29–31 In just three years since they were first reported, inorganic perovskite materials are poised to promote novel optoelectronic applications, such as light-emitting diodes,32 solar cells,33 PDs,34 lasing35 and sensors.36 For example, cubic (α) CsPbI3, which has a reported band gap of 1.73 eV (absorbs in most of the UV and visible spectrum region), is demonstrated as a promising candidate for UV-Vis detection.37
Unfortunately, CsPbI3 crystallizes in several polymorphs in the perovskite lattice, and only at temperatures higher than 310 °C the bulk material converts into a cubic polymorph.38 Meanwhile, the α-CsPbI3 phase degrades into the wider band gap (3.01 eV) orthorhombic phase (δ) quickly,39,40 which makes device fabrication very challenging since δ phase tends to form during annealing and exposure to ambient conditions. To overcome this problem, quantum dots (QDs), which have large nanocrystal surfaces, can be used to stabilize materials at room temperature.41,42 Swarnkar developed quantum dots (QDs) that lowered the phase transition temperature of bulk CsPbI3 from 310 °C to room temperature, thus making it thermodynamically stable at operating temperatures.43 In fact, by taking advantage of their excellent optoelectronic properties, Swarnkar fabricated α-CsPbI3 QDs and photovoltaic cells with an open-circuit voltage as high as 1.23 V and efficiency of 10.77%,44 which demonstrate that α-CsPbI3 QDs are indeed a promising material for semiconductor devices.
Herein, we present broad-bandwidth (UV-Vis-NIR) PDs based on air-stable α-CsPbI3 QDs with an up-conversion material (NaYF4:Yb,Er QDs) surface-modified using a facial low-temperature spin-coating process. The PDs based on the α-CsPbI3 QDs are sensitive to wavelengths in the ultraviolet (UV) to the entire visible range. In addition, this absorption is extended to the near infrared range (∼1100 nm) by integrating the up-conversion material NaYF4:Yb,Er QDs. The PDs exhibit not only prominent optoelectronic properties, but also superior structural and compositional stability under heat in ambient air.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the optical and XRD characterization of the synthetic α-CsPbI3 QDs and NaYF4:Yb,Er QDs. The temperature used in the synthetic process is determined by the solubility of the precursors. Cs-oleate is insoluble in ODE below 60 °C and PbI2 begins to precipitate from the reaction solution above 185 °C. Various sizes of colloidal CsPbI3 QDs were synthesized by tuning the reaction temperature (Fig. 1a and b). 185 °C was chosen as the reaction temperature to obtain a wide absorption with a larger QD size (60 °C for 3.4 nm, 100 °C for 4.5 nm, 130 °C for 5 nm, 150 °C for 6.8 nm, 170 °C for 8 nm, 180 °C for 9 nm, and 185 °C for 12.5 nm QDs). The optical band gap of the α-CsPbI3 QDs synthesized at 185 °C is measured to be 1.73 eV according to their absorption spectra (Fig. 1a), with the corresponding PL peak at 680 nm (Fig. 1b). The structure of the α-CsPbI3 QDs was studied using powder XRD, as displayed in Fig. 1c. The powder appears to be dark red under natural room light, whereas its emits red light under 365 nm UV light irradiation (inset of Fig. 1c). Since the surface of the QDs, which were prepared via a solution process, is saturated by organic ligands, they can be easily dispersed in organic solvents such as octane. It is found that the colloid is stable for more than two months without any detectable changes (inset of Fig. 1c and S2†).

NaYF4 is reported as one of the most efficient hosts for infrared to visible photon upconversion when activated by Yb3+ and Er3+ ions. Fig. 1d shows the emission (under 980 nm photon excitation) and absorption spectra of 2.0 mol% Er3+, 20 mol% Yb3+ co-doped NaYF4. The luminescence mechanisms in NaYF4:Yb,Er are described are as follows.45 When doped with Yb3+ and Er3+, the absorption of an infrared photon (980 nm) elevates the 4f electrons in the Yb3+ ion to the 2F5/2 level, which can transfer the energy to a nearby Er3+ ion. This energy transfer promotes the Er3+ ion from the 4I15/2 to the 4I11/2 state or, if the 4I11/2 state is already populated, from the 4I11/2 state to the 4F7/2 state, thus accomplishing the energy transfer up-conversion process. The electrons in the Er3+ 4F7/2 state subsequently decay nonradiatively to the slightly lower 4S3/2 energy state via a multiphonon relaxation process and then green light is emitted by the electronic transition from the 4S3/2 state to the ground state (Fig. S1(a)†). Also, red and blue emissions resulting from similar processes can be observed. Fig. S1(b)† shows the XRD patterns of the Yb3+ and Er3+ co-doped NaYF4. All the peaks can be indexed as the hexagonal phase (JCPDS no. 16-0334) of NaYF4, and no other phases are obviously observed. Fig. 1e shows the absorption spectra of the assembled α-CsPbI3 film and α-CsPbI3 film surface-modified using the NaYF4:Yb,Er QDs. Compared with the α-CsPbI3 QDs film, the surface-modified film using NaYF4:Yb,Er QDs shows obvious absorption in the 850–1100 nm NIR spectrum range.
The as-prepared α-CsPbI3 QDs were further investigated via transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. 2. The α-CsPbI3 QDs have a square shape with a side length of 15–20 nm (Fig. 1a and b). The high-resolution transmission electronic microscopy (HRTEM) image shows that the lattice fringe is 0.61 nm in Fig. 1c, which is consistent with the (100) plane of α-CsPbI3.46,47 The NaYF4:Yb,Er QDs have a hexagonal shape with a side length of about 20 nm (Fig. 1d and e). The HRTEM image shows that the lattice fringe is 0.36 nm in Fig. 1f. Here, the α-CsPbI3 QD films function as a photoactive material and the NaYF4:Yb/Er QDs are employed to broaden the photoresponsivity to the near infrared region via up-conversion.

Fig. 3a illustrates the prepared device structure. To investigate the microstructure and morphology of the α-CsPbI3 and NaYF4:Yb/Er QDs thin films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out. As shown in Fig. 3b, the as-coated α-CsPbI3 QDs film shows a uniform surface. When NaYF4:Yb/Er QDs are spin-coated on the top of it, distinct particulates are clearly seen (Fig. 3c). Fig. 3d shows the typical I–V logarithm curves in the dark and under illumination with an incident light intensity of 10 mW cm−2 at 525 nm. The device shows a high on/off ratio (up to 104) at 5 V. The electron–hole pairs are generated in the α-CsPbI3 QDs film when the device is irradiated by a UV-Vis light source. Then, the electron–hole pairs are rapidly separated and collected at the electrodes under an applied electric field. Fig. 3e shows the photoresponse curve for the as-fabricated PD with a regular rectangle feature. The steep rise and fall edges with quick on/off time less than 5/5 ms suggests an ultra-fast photoresponse. It should be noted that the rise and decay times of the PDs are defined as the time taken for the initial current to increase or decrease to 90% of the peak value, respectively.48

(d) I–V curves of the PD in the dark and under 525 nm light irradiation with an intensity of 10 mW cm−2. (e) Time-resolved photocurrents of the fabricated PD. (f) Photocurrent spectrum of the fabricated PD. 
The PD was evaluated for its broad-band spectral photoresponse from 260 nm to 1100 nm. Since the band gap of the α-CsPbI3 QDs is 1.73 eV, their maximum photoresponsivity extends to only 720 nm. The photoresponsivity around 980 nm is due to the up-conversion photoluminescence of the NaYF4:Yb,Er QDs.49 More specifically, the NaYF4:Yb,Er film up-converts the NIR photons at 980 nm to visible light which can be effectively absorbed by the α-CsPbI3 film.50 As shown in Fig. 3f, the photoresponsivity first increases with wavelength from 260 to 520 nm, then it decreases at a longer wavelength range, which is in good agreement with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) data.44 It should be noted that the device without NaYF4:Yb,Er QDs shows no response in the wavelength region after 800 nm (Fig. S3†).
The dependence of the on/off switching performance on the channel length L was studied for the α-CsPbI3 QDs architecture. Fig. 4a shows the results measured using a bias voltage 5 V. It can be seen that the photocurrent increases as the channel length decreases. A longer channel length prolongs the carrier transit time from one electrode to the other electrode, and hence reduces the photocurrent.51 Significant performance improvement is expected if the channel length is shortened below 5 μm. Additionally, the effect of spectral photoresponse on the I–V logarithm curves was investigated in the irradiation range from UV to NIR (365–980 nm), as shown in Fig. 4b. The spectral photoresponse result clearly demonstrates broad-band photodetection characteristics.

(f) The fitted curve for light intensity to photocurrent variation. 
Stability is also an important factor for PDs being used for long-time operation. The normalized time-dependent photocurrents measured at a bias of 5 V are shown in Fig. 4c. During the first cycle of the photoresponse measurement, the device exhibits excellent stability and reproducible I–t curves. Fig. 4d shows the device performance tested for 1000 on–off cycles, in which there is no obvious deterioration (<0.5%) and fluctuation, thus further suggesting the excellent stability of the PD. We also tested it using varied light intensity. Fig. 4e shows the photocurrent as a function of light intensity. The photocurrent increases with an enhancement in illumination intensity as expected since the number of photogenerated carriers is proportional to the absorbed photon flux. The fitting line reveals that the photocurrent is proportional to the light intensity (Fig. 4f). According to the following eqn (1):52 (1)where, ILight is the current under light illumination, IDark is the dark current, Pill is the incident illumination power on the effective area (channel area), and R is the photoresponsivity, the best photoresponsivity (R, 1.5 A W−1) is achieved upon device optimization. It is found that the photoresponsivity performance is better than all the other perovskite QDs based PDs with a lateral device structure.53
Phase stability is another key figure-of-merit for PDs. Fig. 5 presents the morphology of the pristine α-CsPbI3 QD film stored in ambient conditions (30% RH and 25 °C) and films post-annealed at different temperatures. Fig. 5a displays the as-deposited α-CsPbI3 QDs film stored in ambient conditions for 60 days. The results show that the film morphology was the same as that of the original film in Fig. 3b. Fig. 5g shows that there is no obvious change in the absorption spectra of the CsPbI3 QDs film after 60 days, which demonstrates its superior stability in air.

In order to examine its phase stability, the α-CsPbI3 QDs film was firstly treated at different annealing conditions. The film morphology was then analyzed using AFM imaging. Fig. 5b shows the film annealed at 50 °C for 1 day, at which point some of the α-CsPbI3 QDs started to agglomerate, but there was no conversion into δ-CsPbI3 QDs. Further annealing transformed the agglomerated α-CsPbI3 QDs into δ-CsPbI3 QDs. Fig. 5c–f shows that the high temperature >50 °C caused the α-CsPbI3 QDs to agglomerate into a bulk film and converted them to the δ-CsPbI3 phase. Fig. 5h shows the absorption spectra before and after annealing at 200 °C for 10 min and Fig. 5i displays the XRD patterns of the α-CsPbI3 QDs film before and after annealing at 200 °C for 10 min.
The device performance of the PDs was characterized by measuring the I–t curves. Fig. 6a shows the device performance measured under 525 nm light illumination (10 mW cm−2) at a bias of 5 V after being stored in ambient conditions for 60 days. No obvious deterioration is observed, and the photocurrent remained at about 10−6 A under irradiation over the course of 60 days of storage. A similar pulse feature along the rise and decay edges of the photoresponse curve was also observed, which suggests that the PDs have excellent air-stability.
 Fig. 6  On–off switching properties of the α-CsPbI3 QDs based PDs measured under 525 nm light illumination (10 mW cm−2) at a bias of 5 V: (a) stored in ambient conditions over the course of 60 days, (b) annealed at 50 °C for 1 day, (c) annealed at 100 °C for 60 min and (d) annealed at 200 °C for 10 min. 
Meanwhile, we compared the performance of the as-deposited α-CsPbI3 PD and the device under different annealing temperatures. As seen in Fig. 6b, the I–t curve in the PD annealed at 50 °C is lower than the reference PD without annealing. A sharp decrease in photocurrent is seen after the PD is annealed for 60 min at 100 °C (Fig. 6c). It is apparent that the degradation is related to the phase transition of the α-CsPbI3 film. Nevertheless, the steep rise edge could be maintained in ambient air with little change. When the α-CsPbI3 QDs completely transitioned from cubic to orthorhombic at 200 °C, their absorption and photocurrent dropped sharply (Fig. 5h). It should be noted that the device with NaYF4:Yb,Er QDs shows the same phase stability as the α-CsPbI3 based PD due to the intrinsic nature of the α-CsPbI3 QDs (Fig. S4†).
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that quantum dots can be employed to stabilize the perovskite structure of cesium lead iodide. The as-prepared α-CsPbI3 QDs film exhibits a uniform and well-defined morphology which are favorable for charge separation and transport. The solution and thin film exhibit impressive stability when exposed at 30% RH and 25 °C over two months. When the α-CsPbI3 QDs are surface-modified using NaYF4:Yb,Er QDs, their optical response is extended to the NIR region to allow broadband application from the UV to visible to NIR region (260 nm–1100 nm). As a result, the device exhibits good responsivity, high on/off ratio, fast rise/decay speed and long-term stability. The device performance and the integration of NaYF4:Yb,Er QDs or other functional nano-materials paves the way to broadened spectral responses and superior device performances.
Experimental
Materials preparation

Synthesis of α-CsPbI3 QDs54,55. 
Cs2CO3 (0.5 g), 1-octadecene (ODE, 50 mL) and oleic acid (OA, 2 mL) were added to a round bottom flask and stirred under vacuum for 30 min at 120 °C to obtain Cs-oleate. PbI2 (1 g), ODE (50 mL), OA (5 mL) and oleylamine (OAm, 5 mL) were stirred in another round bottom flask and degassed under vacuum at 120 °C for 1 hour before the flask was filled with N2. Then, Cs-oleate (8 mL) was swiftly injected into the reaction mixture at different reaction temperatures. The reaction mixture turned dark red and the reaction was quenched by immediate immersion of the flask into an ice bath (∼5 s). The synthesized α-CsPbI3 QDs were precipitated by adding 200 mL methyl acetate (MeOAc). This process was repeated twice and the α-CsPbI3 QDs were finally dispersed in hexane at a concentration of 50 mg mL−1.


Synthesis of NaYF4:Yb,Er core/shell QDs45. 
A mixture CF3COONa (0.5 mmol), (CF3COO)3Y (0.195 mmol), (CF3COO)3Yb (0.05 mmol) and (CF3COO)3Er (0.005 mmol) was dissolved in OAm (5 mL) and heated to 340 °C under argon protection. After 30 min, 0.5 mL of the product was taken out as the core solution. 1 mL shell precursor solution containing CF3COONa (0.5 mmol) and (CF3COO)3Y (0.25 mmol) in OAm was slowly added to the reaction mixture. The reaction was allowed to continue for another 30 min. Finally, 100 μL of the core/shell QDs stock solution was precipitated by centrifugation. The precipitated QDs were rinsed twice with ethanol, and re-dispersed in chloroform at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1.

Device fabrication
The PDs fabrication process is described as follows: the α-CsPbI3 layer was fabricated by spin-coating a solution of α-CsPbI3 QDs onto a clean quartz substrate at 2500 rpm for 15 s. To form the high-mobility and low-trap density α-CsPbI3 layer, the prepared film was quickly dipped in a neat MeOAc solution and saturated Pb(OAc)2 MeOAc solution, respectively. This process was repeated four times to produce QD films with thicknesses of about 300 nm. Subsequently, NaYF4:Yb,Er QDs were spin-coated on the surface of the prepared α-CsPbI3 layer at 3500 rpm for 30 s. All the spin-coating steps were performed under ambient conditions. Finally, a pair of interdigitated Au electrodes (100 nm thick) was thermally evaporated onto the films through a shadow mask, which resulted in a channel width/length of 2000/5 μm.
Characterization
All electrical characterizations were conducted using an Agilent B2902A in ambient conditions at 25 °C, and the temperature was controlled using a hot-plate. The monochromatic light was from a Newport Oriel 200™. Prior to the utilization of the light, the spectral and the light intensity were calibrated using a mono-silicon detector. TEM images were obtained on a JEM-2100 JEOL TEM. The surface morphology was characterized via AFM (Dimension ICON). The thickness of the films was determined using a profilometer. UV-vis spectra were recorded using a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer. The samples were excited by a pulsed laser with a wavelength of 365 nm. The phase compositions of samples were characterized using a DX-2700 XRD with Cu Kα radiation (k = 0.15418 nm) in the 2θ range of 10–50°.
