    , Accepted 30th March 2021First published on 31st March 2021AbstractTin (Sn) is a potential replacement for lead in organic–inorganic perovskite solar cell (PVSC) technology due to the attractive optoelectronic properties of Sn-perovskites. However, the poor stability of Sn2+ ions is still the main hindrance for achieving highly stable and efficient Sn-based PVSCs. In this work, anilinium hypophosphite (AHP) is introduced as a co-additive into a Sn-absorber perovskite precursor containing the tin fluoride (SnF2) additive. The incorporation of the AHP additive not only prohibits the phase separation of SnF2 but also passivates the perovskite films and finally results in absorbers with superior structural and optoelectronic properties. The underlying reason is related to the formation of a double-salt complex (Sn(H2PO2)2·SnF2) through the interaction between AHP and SnF2. The high quality of the absorber film induced by AHP delivers an improved device power conversion efficiency (PCE) with a higher open-circuit voltage than those without the AHP additive. More importantly, the device with the AHP additive can retain up to 97% of its PCE after 30 days of storage in a glovebox.
Introduction
The rapid development of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells in the last decade has sparked hopes of having a fourth generation solar technology. Organometal perovskites have been attracting the attention of researchers due to their impressive optoelectrical properties.1,2 The general formula of organic–inorganic perovskites is ABX3, where A is a monovalent organic cation such as methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA) cations or a mixture of the two; B is a divalent cation which can be lead (Pb), tin (Sn), or germanium (Ge) cations; and X is a monovalent halide anion which can be iodide (I), bromide (Br) or chloride (Cl) anions.3–5 Due to concerted efforts to manipulate the device structure, fabrication methods, and interfacial engineering, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) has jumped from the initial 3.8% recorded in 20092 to 25.5% in 2020.6–9 The best-performing PVSCs have been achieved using Pb halide as the inorganic component forming what is commonly known as lead-based perovskite solar cells.5,8,10 The rapid rise in the PCEs of lead-PVSCs has been attributed to the robust optoelectronic properties such as high light absorption coefficient, excellent defect tolerance, long charge carrier diffusion lengths (∼3.5 μm), excellent charge carrier mobilities, and low exciton binding energies (37 or 45 meV) of the Pb perovskite absorber layer.11–13 Despite the numerous attractive attributes of Pb-PVSCs, the commercialization of PVSCs is hampered by the toxicity of lead, and also, according to the Shockley–Queisser radiative limit, the efficiency of lead-PVSCs is limited to below 31% for a single-junction solar cell since the bandgap of the lead perovskite absorber which is 1.6 eV is slightly above the optimum bandgap of thin-film solar cells.10,11,13,14
Replacements for Pb2+ have been sought to help propel forward the prospects of commercialization of PVSC technology. The replacement must consider the equilibrium crystal structure of perovskites which can be evaluated from Goldschmidt's tolerance  and the octahedral μ = rB/rX factors, where r represents the radius and the subscripts are as defined in ABX3 before.3,5 The range of t is 0.8 < t < 1 close to 1 and the range of μ should be 0.44 < μ < 0.9 to make the perovskite maintain the desirable cubic structure, where the B metal is 6-fold coordinated by X in BX6 octahedra and A is 12-fold coordinated by X anions in AX12 cubo-octahedra.5,15 Some of the potential replacements for Pb include Sn, Ge, Bi, Sb, and Cu, but the most researched and best performing is tin-PVSCs.5,16 Amongst the possible lead replacements, tin-perovskite solar cells (Sn-PVSCs) enjoy the highest efficiency of up to 13%17 due to the superior optoelectronic properties of the tin-perovskite absorber layer.18,19 Tin-based perovskite films have a bandgap in the range between 1.2 and 1.4 eV, which is within the optimal band gap for high performing single-junction solar cells according to the Shockley–Queisser radiative limit, a small exciton binding energy (≈ 18 meV) and high carrier mobility.18–20
Despite all the superior properties of tin-based perovskites, the PCEs of tin-based PVSCs still stand at about 13%17 since the first tin-based PVSC (CsSnI3) was reported in 2012 by Shum's group with an efficiency of 0.9%.6,10,21,22 The inferiority of the PCE of tin-PVSCs compared to lead-PVSCs is largely contributed by the poor stability of tin perovskite, which is a result of rapid oxidation of Sn2+ to stable Sn4+.1,23,24 The oxidation and vacancies result in films with high background density carriers, which favour nonradiative recombination and can lead to high hysteresis in Sn-devices.18,24–26 A number of methods have been used to eliminate or reduce the stability issues, which include (i) the use of additives such as SnF2 and SnCl2 to suppress the facile Sn2+ oxidation in Sn-perovskites,16,27,28 (ii) the alteration of device structure, in which researchers have employed the use of inverted tin-perovskite solar cell architecture (p–i–n structure) to achieve high performing and stable devices,10,18,29,30 (iii) the use of mixed monovalent cation (organic mixture or organic and inorganic mixture) tin perovskite, the most researched mixture being FAxMA1−xSnI3; because of the better stability of FASnI3 and better optical properties of MASnI3, the film benefits from the advantages drawn from the components of the mixture,26,31 and (iv) the use of a trace amount of 2D tin-based Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites to improve the stability of Sn-PVSCs.23
SnF2 and SnCl2 have vastly been incorporated in Sn-PVSC precursor solutions to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+; however, they lead to phase separation caused by excess SnF2 and SnCl2 in the precursor solution. Phase separation is detrimental to the performance of Sn-PVSCs as it creates a lot of nonradiative trap centres in the device which results in low open circuit voltage (VOC) and PCEs.32 Recently, researchers have turned their focus on incorporating organic co-additives to suppress the phase separation caused by excess SnF2 and SnCl2 to improve the performance and stability of Sn-PVSCs.33
In this study, we report the use of a new reducing agent, anilinium hypophosphite (AHP), as a co-additive to SnF2 to improve the quality of the Sn-perovskite film and the performance and stability of the corresponding PVSCs. We select AHP as an additive based on the following rationale: benzene ring is hydrophobic and its π-conjugation structure favours charge transport; and hypophosphite can reduce Sn4+ to Sn2+. The devices based on the AHP additive show a champion PCE of 6.87%, much higher than those of control devices without AHP which have a maximum PCE of 4.74%. More importantly, the devices with the AHP additive show much improved stability, retaining up to 97% of their PCE after 30 days of storage in a glovebox.
Experimental section
Materials
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) water dispersion (AI 4083) was acquired from Ossila. Phenethyl ammonium iodide (PEAI) (>98%), methylammonium iodide (MAI) (99%), formamidinium iodide (FAI) (>98%), tin(II) iodide SnI2 (99.999%), tin fluoride (SnF2) (>99%), [6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM), bathocuproine (BCP) (99.99%), N,N-dimethylmethanamide (DMF) (99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (99.8%), anilinium hypophosphite (AHP) (97%), and chlorobenzene (CB) (99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the materials were used as received without further purification.
Solution preparation
All the perovskite absorbers were obtained by adding a trace amount of PEAI (0.05 M) into the mixed ammonium cation (FA0.5MA0.45SnI3) precursor solution. For the perovskite, the solvent used in the precursor solution was DMF and DMSO mixed in the ratio of 4:1, respectively. The concentrations of all the prepared solutions were fixed at 1 M. The reference precursor solution comprised FAI:MAI:PEAI:SnI2:SnF2 in the molar ratio of 0.5:0.45:0.05:1:0.1. The AHP solution contained FAI:MAI:PEAI:SnI2:SnF2:AHP in the molar ratio of 0.5:0.45:0.05:1:0.1:0.05. Before use, the solutions were filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter. The PC60BM solution was prepared by dissolving 20 mg of PC60BM powder in 1 ml of CB. The solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter. The BCP solution was prepared by dissolving 0.5 mg in 1 ml of anhydrous ethanol.
Device fabrication
The devices were built on an ITO glass substrate. The substrates were soaked in water with detergent. They were then scrubbed under running deionized water. Then, the substrates were ultrasonicated in deionized water and ethanol for 15 minutes each. Before use, the substrates were dried using a N2 gas gun and finally surface-treated in a UV-ozone machine for 20 minutes. On the cleaned substrates, 30 μl of PEDOT:PSS solution filtered using a 0.45 μm PTFE filter was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 40 s, and then they were dried in the air at 150 °C for 30 minutes. After cooling down to room-temperature the PEDOT:PSS substrates were transferred to a nitrogen filled glovebox. 20 μl of the perovskite solution was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 40 s in two steps; in the first step the solution was spun at 1000 rpm for ten seconds, and in the second step the spinning speed was 5000 rpm. In the 25th second of the second step, 150 μl of CB was steadily dripped on the spinning substrate. The perovskite film was annealed in a glovebox at 70 °C for 30 minutes. Then 20 μl of PC60BM was spin-coated on the perovskite substrate at 2000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 minutes. After cooling down, 75 μl of the BCP solution was spin-coated on PC60BM at 5000 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 80 °C for 10 minutes. Finally, 70 nm of silver (Ag) was thermally evaporated on the BCP layer to obtain the final devices.
Characterization of films and devices
A PerkinElmer Lambda 900 UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2600) was used to measure the optical absorbance of the absorber layer in the transmission mode. The photoluminescence (PL) measurement was carried out using a 450 nm excitation laser with an excitation intensity of 4.2 mW on an area of 2.5 × 2 mm2 at an angle of 45° in the transmission mode. Time-resolved-photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement was conducted using an Edinburgh Instruments spectrometer (FLS1000). The PL decay was fitted by a biexponential decay formula and the average decay time τav was calculated using the relationship: (1)where τ1, τ2, B1 and B2 are the lifetimes of the first and second components of the exponential fitting function, and the amplitude of the first and second components in counts in the fitting range channel, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer with CuKα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. The X-ray was generated on a copper target and the wavelength of the X-ray was 1.54 angstrom. The morphology of the films was determined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; LEO 1550). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the films were obtained using a PIKE MIRacle Vertex 70 spectrometer (Bruker) with a DLATGS detector at room temperature. The J–V curves were recorded by measuring the photocurrent using a 2400 Series Source Meter (Keithley) with an air mass (AM) of 1.5 Solar Simulator. The active area of the device was 0.0725 cm2.
Results and discussion
XRD measurement
The XRD patterns of the films were first investigated to elucidate the effects of the AHP additive on the crystallinity and structural stability of the films in the lab air environment (temperature: 15–25 °C; relative humidity: 20–30%), as shown in Fig. 1(a). The XRD pattern of the FA0.5MA0.45PEA0.05SnI3 sample showed highly crystallized and well-oriented films. The XRD patterns of the films with and without AHP showed peaks at 14.1 and 28.5°, which are assigned to (100) and (200) crystal planes, respectively. The peaks at 14.1 and 28.5° are well pronounced, indicating a preferred orientation of the (h00) planes of the perovskite crystals parallel to the substrate.10 The full-widths at half-maximum (FWHMs) of the (100) peak of the absorber materials with and without AHP are 0.13 and 0.15°, respectively, indicating that the film formation favours the (h00) planes, which is the most favourable orientation to enhance the photovoltaic performance.34 The smaller full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the perovskite film with AHP is slightly smaller than that of the film without AHP, which is an indication of a larger domain size for the absorber film with AHP and also indicates that AHP can be used to improve the crystallinity of the absorber material.

(b) Variation of the normalized (110) peak intensity of perovskite films with and without AHP after exposure to air for different times. 
The degradation rate of the films in the air was monitored using their XRD patterns obtained after exposure to air. The corresponding variations of normalized (110) peak intensities for perovskite films with/without AHP are summarized in Fig. 1(b). After 3 hours of air exposure, the XRD pattern intensity of both films exhibited a certain level of decrease, but the film without AHP showed a faster degradation rate as its intensity reduced to almost half after only 3 hours. When the films were further exposed to air for 36 hours, the film without AHP completely degraded with no visible peak (keeping only 0.5% of the pristine intensity). In contrast, the films with AHP still display a weak perovskite peak, retaining about 5.5% of their initial intensity. This test showed that the AHP-based film is much more stable as compared to the pristine films in ambient conditions, suggesting that the AHP additive is very promising to further increase the stability of the Sn-based perovskite, which is mainly attributed to the H2PO2− anion which is very effective in reducing Sn4+ to Sn2+.
Morphological properties
The morphology of the perovskite films deposited by the solvent engineering method was determined using SEM images. The solvent engineering method involved mixing of DMF and DMSO solvents at a 4:1 volume ratio and the use of chlorobenzene as the antisolvent during film deposition. The antisolvent technique retards the rapid chemical reaction between FAI, MAI, and SnI2, which helps in the formation of highly dense and uniform film surfaces.15 The use of DMSO helps in the formation of intermediate adduct phases, which slows down the rate of crystallization of perovskite film and thus leads to proper film coverage on the substrate.35 Sn-Perovskites are known for their low stability caused by the rapid oxidation of Sn2+ and SnF2 has commonly been used to reduce the oxidation rate. SnF2 is important in obtaining high current densities in Sn-perovskite solar cells.31 SnF2 inhibits the oxidation and fairly increases the stability and PCE of Sn-perovskite solar cells. However, SnF2 addition leads to the formation of SnF2 aggregates on the film surfaces, as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b) (the white spots/rods in the film), resulting in poor film morphology as noted by other researchers.16,35 The films containing SnF2 only as the additive also exhibit notable pinholes which largely contribute to an increase in charge trap density centres.5 The effects of the aggregates and pinholes can lead to fluctuations in the performance of solar cells and increased hysteresis in the cells.36 Since the phase separation is not uniformly distributed in the films, it can easily be argued that the performance of the devices based on the SnF2 additive is unpredictable and hence not easily reproducible. The cracks observed in the top-right corner of Fig. 2(b) are a result of exposure to the electron beam of the SEM equipment. The films without AHP can be claimed to be sensitive to the SEM electron beam and thus the interaction between the film and the electron beam leads to a degradation which manifests in the form of cracks.37,38

Upon the addition of 5% AHP, the other phases associated with SnF2 are annihilated and the resulting films show a compact morphology (Fig. 2(c) and (d)). The elimination of the aggregate phases by the AHP can be attributed to the reaction between the PO in AHP and SnF2, leading to the formation of a complex, which will be discussed in the subsequent section.39 The phase elimination can lead to an enhancement in the performance of tin-based perovskite devices as noted by earlier researchers.27 More interestingly, there are no clear grain boundaries for films with AHP. We think that this is mostly because the incorporation of AHP would slow down the crystallization of the Sn-perovskite, resulting in homogenous and compact films with little grain boundaries. Grain boundaries are often marred with a lot of defects; thus, the fusion of grain boundaries can greatly help in reducing the defects and improving the performance of Sn-based devices. The combination of reduced aggregates, pinholes and grain boundaries suggests a promising passivation effect of our double additive strategy. Moreover, as noted earlier, AHP contains a benzene ring, which has a high electron cloud density, and thus the passivation of perovskite grain boundaries could also be expected because of the electrostatic interaction between the undercoordinated Sn2+ and the benzene ring. Also, we noted that no cracks were observed when films containing AHP were exposed to the SEM electron beam. Because the interaction between AHP and SnF2 results in a tin complex which passivates the surface and tin complexes as noted by other researchers are stable, it can inhibit the degradation of films under the SEM electron beam.40 The blurring of grain boundaries can also be due to an increase in the grain size of the perovskite film resulting from the incorporation of AHP into the perovskite precursor as noted earlier.41
FTIR spectroscopy and mechanisms of reaction
From the SEM images in this work, it was speculated that SnF2 reacts with AHP to form a complex which would passivate the grain surfaces and boundaries. According to recent studies, H2PO2− anions can interact with SnCl2 to form an intermediate phase that can improve the film morphology of FASnI3 films and is responsible for the passivation of Sn-perovskite film surfaces.33,42 Guided by this idea, we developed the speculation since the AHP additive contains H2PO2− anions and SnF2 is also a tin halide like SnCl2. This speculation was investigated and confirmed by the use of FTIR measurements, as shown in Fig. 3. The AHP co-additive is a phosphite compound containing PO, and several researchers have reported that the band corresponding to the stretching vibration of the PO bond lies in the 1320 to 1140 cm−1 frequency region.43 In Fig. 3(a), a characteristic PO bond stretch for pure AHP is observed at 1146 cm−1, and after mixing AHP and SnF2 (molar ratio of 1:1) the peak shifted to 1111 cm−1; the broad peak shoulder formed in the FTIR spectrum of AHP and SnF2 is due to the characteristic mode of PO in pure AHP. From the literature, it has been noted that the strong interaction between AHP and fluoride compounds can lead to a shift in the characteristic FTIR vibration bond peak to a lower frequency region.44Fig. 3(a), thus, confirms that there is a strong interaction between AHP and SnF2, and this interaction results in a complex of Sn(H2PO2)2·SnF2 which can passivate the grain surfaces and boundaries. To confirm the presence of the complex in the perovskite film, FTIR measurement was done on perovskite films with and without AHP, in which both films contained 0.1 M SnF2. In Fig. 3(b), the film without AHP showed no peak in the PO region, while the film with AHP showed a broad peak in the region, with a characteristic peak of PO at 1112 cm−1, and this peak is similar to the peak observed in the FTIR result of the film formed after mixing AHP and SnF2. The presence of the 1112 cm−1 peak confirmed that the complex of Sn(H2PO2)2·SnF2 resulting from AHP-SnF2 is present in the film and is responsible for passivating the perovskite films. The 1080 to 1250 cm−1 region of Fig. 3(b) was extracted and is plotted in Fig. 3(c) to clearly show the peak associated with PO resulting from the addition of AHP in the perovskite film.

We can now conclude the reaction mechanism when using the AHP additive. Usually, AHP with a chemical formula of C6H5NH3H2PO2 contains an H2PO2− anion which has a reducing ability and is capable of reducing Sn4+ to Sn2+ according to the following reaction:32 Sn4+ + 3H2PO2− → Sn2+ + 2HPO32− + PH4+(2)Meanwhile, as shown by the FTIR study, there is a reaction between AHP and SnF2, forming a complex which is a kind of double salt, as shown in the equation: 2SnF2 + 2C6H10NPO2 → Sn(H2PO2)2·SnF2 + 2C6H5NH3F(3)We note that during the reduction of Sn4+ and the formation of a double salt complex there are some by-products such as PH4I or C6H5NH3F. It should be mentioned that these by-products will be decomposed or released directly during the annealing procedure. Therefore, the incorporation of AHP will be expected to prohibit the oxidation of Sn2+ and at the same time it can retard the phase separation of SnF2 and passivate the perovskite films by forming a stable double salt complex.
Optical properties and charge dynamics
The absorbance spectra of the perovskite materials were obtained as shown in Fig. 4(a). The absorber materials containing SnF2 showed a bandgap of 1.33 eV, which is supported by its absorption onset at 928 nm in the solar spectrum, and the film containing the AHP and SnF2 mixture showed a bandgap of 1.31 eV, which corresponds to an absorption onset of 933 nm. The bandgap obtained is consistent with earlier reports.18 From the absorbance spectrum (Fig. 4(a)), the use of the AHP co-additive improves the absorbance of the absorber layer and leads to a reduced bandgap of 1.31 eV; this effect is supported by the improved film quality as shown in the SEM images.15
 Fig. 4  (a) The absorbance and (b) photoluminescence (PL) spectra of FA0.5MA0.45PEA0.05SnI3 films with and without AHP. 
PL spectroscopy, Fig. 4(b), was used to verify the optical behaviour of the absorber materials. The PL peaks showed a red shift, from 928 to 933 nm, when the AHP additive was added into the film as predicted by the optical measurements. The red shift observed is possibly due to improved crystallinity as observed in the XRD measurement.33 The PL intensity of the films containing AHP is higher than the film containing SnF2 as the only reducing agent. The increased PL intensity is an indication that the film absorber quality is improved by the incorporation of the co-additive. Improving the perovskite film quality is generally essential in reducing nonradiative recombination. Our AHP co-additive annihilates the different phases caused by the use of SnF2 and thus reduces the non-radiative recombination centres in the films and hence generates an increased PL intensity.45,46 In other words, the deep-level defects which are usually non-radiative recombination centres in perovskites have been effectively passivated through the combination of AHP and SnF2.47
Time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurement was also made to confirm the ability of AHP to passivate the defects and improve the quality of Sn-perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 5, the carrier lifetime of films containing AHP is 1.94 ns, which is much higher than that of the films containing only SnF2 (1.29 ns). The carrier lifetimes of films can be used to predict their quality and charge carrier dynamics.48 Faster carrier decay in films containing single SnF2 is an indication of a film suffering from increased non-radiative recombination contributed by the high density of trap centres or surface defects as seen in the SEM images. Combining AHP and SnF2 significantly reduces the surface trap sites and hence the increased carrier decay time. The slow carrier lifetime decay gives time for maximum charge extraction by the electron- and hole-transporting medium, which minimizes the chances of charge recombination and energy loss and leads to an improved VOC.49

Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the effect of improved film properties on the photovoltaic performances of the devices, Sn-perovskite solar cells with a structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/FA0.5MA0.45PEA0.05SnI3/PCBM/BCP/Ag were fabricated. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the champion devices are shown in Fig. 6(a), and statistical information of the fabricated devices is summarized in Table 1. The champion device with SnF2 as the only additive showed VOC values of 0.44 and 0.42 V, fill factors (FFs) of 43.08 and 41.18%, JSC values of 25.38 and 25.26 mA cm−2, and PCEs of 4.74 and 4.42% in the forward and reverse scan directions, respectively. The champion device made from the films fabricated using AHP showed enhanced device parameters, with VOC values of 0.48 V and 0.47 V, fill factors (FFs) of 57.16% and 55.98%, JSC values of 25.38 mA cm−2 and 25.21 mA cm−2, and PCEs of 6.87% and 6.65% in the forward and reverse scan directions, respectively. The PCEs of solar cells with and without the AHP additive were in the ranges of 4% to 6.8% and 2.5% to 4.7%, respectively, as shown in the histogram in Fig. 6(b). The best performing solar cells with and without AHP exhibited steady JSC values of 20 mA cm−2 and 17.32 mA cm−2, respectively, over a period of 120 s at a bias of 0.34 V and 0.29 V, respectively, under AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2 continuous irradiation, as shown in Fig. 6(c). After storing the device in a glove box for 30 days, the champion device fabricated using AHP retained 97% of its PCE, and it was noted that the hysteresis reduced to negligible values with a slight increase in VOC as shown in Fig. 6(d). The J–V curve of the device without AHP stored in the glovebox was also measured after 30 days, its PCE fell by more than 20%, and also the hysteresis persisted as shown in Fig. 6(d).

The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the champion devices were determined in air, and, as shown in Fig. 7(a), the EQEs of devices with AHP were slightly higher than those of devices without AHP. This result agrees well with the optical results in this work. The integrated JSC values of the devices were different from the JSC values measured from the J–V curves, which could be because the EQEs of the cells were measured in air, and the devices spent time in the air during the setting of the EQE machine. To verify whether exposure to air has any effect on the JSC values, the EQE measurement was done at an interval of ten minutes, and, as predicted, the JSC reduced further with the AHP based device having minimum JSC loss. Within ten minutes, the JSC of the device based on AHP dropped by 23% and that without AHP dropped by 34% as shown in Fig. 7(b).

Conclusion
In this work, we showed that a combination of AHP and SnF2 additives can improve the quality of the Sn-perovskite film and enhance the performance and stability of Sn-based perovskite solar cells. The incorporation of the AHP additive eradicated the aggregation of SnF2 by forming a double salt complex, which could effectively passivate the perovskite films, resulting in films with uniform morphology and better optoelectronic properties. More importantly, the additive dramatically improved the stability of perovskite films and PVSCs by prohibiting the oxidation of Sn2+. Our work suggests that combining a right organic co-additive with SnF2 is very promising for improving the PCEs and stability of Sn-PVSCs.
