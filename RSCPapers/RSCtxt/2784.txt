    , Accepted 25th June 2018First published on 26th June 2018AbstractFor organic solar cells using perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives as electron acceptors, bulky substitution and covalent dimerization (or multimerization) are often used to reduce the intermolecular π–π interaction to prevent PDI from forming oversized phase separation with electron donors. Here, we have investigated the influence of different dimerization and alkylation processes on the molecular packing and electron transport properties of PDI derivatives by means of molecular dynamics simulations in combination with electronic structure calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. The results suggest that like branched alkyl substitution, dimerization can effectively prevent π–π aggregation. Particularly, the π–π stacking is mostly prohibited for the bay C–C dimeric PDIs, even with linear alkyl substituents. More importantly, different from the case of bulky substitution, dimerization will hardly reduce short intermolecular contacts between PDI units. Unexpectedly, the electron mobilities of dimeric PDIs are always higher than those of the parent monomeric PDIs due to extra intramolecular electronic connections. Owing to simultaneously enhanced intermolecular and intramolecular interactions, the electron mobility of the bay C–C dimeric PDI with linear alkyl chains is increased by nearly 20 times with respect to the monomeric PDI with branched alkyl chains. Our work demonstrates that high charge mobilities along with suppressed π–π aggregation can be achieved by properly tailoring both the modes of dimerization and substitution.
Introduction
Perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives, a class of traditional dyes, have attracted intensive attention as electron acceptors in organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their great advantages of intense light absorption, deep electron affinity, high electron mobility, and excellent photochemical stability.1–6 In 1986, Tang et al. reported the first donor/acceptor bilayer heterojunction OSC devices with a perylene tetracarboxylic derivative as an electron acceptor and copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) as a donor and realized a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ca. 1%.7 Then after persistent molecular structure modifications and/or processing optimizations, OSCs based on PDI acceptors have achieved great success. For instance, Bazan et al. reported a PCE of 3.0% for OSC devices employing a monomeric PDI with 1-ethypropyl groups at the imide positions as the acceptor and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 as the donor in 2013.8 Later in 2014, Marks et al. synthesized a series of slip-stacked monomeric PDIs with aromatic groups at the bay positions and a higher PCE of 3.67% was obtained with PBTI3T.9 Recently, many kinds of twisted PDI derivatives were synthesized by linking two or more PDI units directly or through a bridge.10–22 Such modifications improved the PCEs of the PDI-based OSCs significantly and made them even superior to those of the fullerene-based OSCs.19,23,24 For example, an outstanding PCE of 8.42% was obtained for OSCs using the PDBT-T1 polymer donor and a dimeric PDI that is directly linked via a single C–C bond at the bay positions.25 Liang et al. reported a trimer with direct linkages of single N–N bonds at the imide positions and achieved a PCE of 7.25% in combination with PBDT-TS1.26 For PDI compounds connected via a bridge core, SF-PDI2 with a spirobifluorene bridge achieved a higher PCE of 9.5% in combination with P3TEA; Ta-PDI, a PDI trimer with triazine as the core along with PTB7-Th achieved a PCE of 9.15%.27,28 By fusing PDI units with a two-carbon bridge, Nuckolls et al. synthesized a series of helical PDI molecules with a different number of PDI units and a PCE of 8.3% was obtained with hPDI4 and PTB7-Th.29 More recently, Yan et al. reported a PDI tetramer, FTTB-PDI4, by attaching four thiophene fused PDI units to a benzene core and when combined with P3TEA, a prominent PCE of 10.58% was achieved, which is the best value reported for PDI-based OSCs so far.24 In a word, PDI derivatives have shown great potential as electron acceptors for high efficiency nonfullerene OSCs.
The improvement of PCEs for the twisted PDIs can be mainly attributed to the reduction of the high planarity and the resultant alleviation of strong self-aggregation to form large domains in the blending films, which is detrimental to exciton harvesting and thus severely limits the PCEs.8,10,30–33 The twisted PDIs successfully inhibit strong intermolecular π–π packing and the phase size is decreased from hundreds of nanometers to about tens of nanometers. Nonetheless, the electron mobilities (μe) become the bottleneck for further improving the PCEs of PDI-based OSCs, because the μe of the active layers in these high-efficiency OSCs could only reach a magnitude of ca. 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which still lags behind those of fullerene based devices.8–10,13,21,25,34–41 On one hand, the electron transport for the twisted PDI derivatives depends on the intermolecular packing structures that have important influence on the electronic interaction between intermolecular PDI units.42 On the other hand, the electronic interaction for intramolecular PDI pairs would also play a critical role in determining the electron transport in such kinds of PDIs since it provides an extra pathway for electron transfer.43–45 Hence, it is highly desirable to elucidate the impact of different twisted structures on molecular packing and electron transport for the PDI derivatives.
In this contribution, we focus on directly linked dimeric PDI derivatives (Fig. 1) and have investigated the integrated influence of dimerization and alkylation on molecular packing and electron transport properties by means of molecular dynamics simulations in combination with the incoherent charge hopping and diffusion model. It is found that the different linkage modes have an important impact on the intramolecular electron transfer between two PDI monomers. The intramolecular electronic coupling for the bay C–C dimeric PDI derivatives (DC1/DC2) is at least eight times stronger than that of the imide N–N linked dimeric PDI derivatives (DN1/DN2). On the other hand, the intermolecular interaction and electronic couplings can be effectively enhanced upon replacing branched alkyl chains (DN2/DC2) with straight alkyl chains (DN1/DC1). Owing to the synergetic effect of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, the electron mobility of DC1 is the highest among the studied PDI derivatives, as high as nearly twenty times that of the monomeric PDI with branched alkyl chains (M2) despite large suppression of π–π aggregation. Our work points out the importance of simultaneously enhancing intramolecular and intermolecular electronic interactions on improving electron mobilities of dimeric and multimeric twisted PDI derivatives.

Computational methods
MD simulations
Molecular packing morphologies of the studied PDI derivatives were obtained by atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the Gromacs-4.6.7 software package.46 The general AMBER force field (GAFF) has been proved to be a well-established force field for organic small molecules and was used to describe the atom types (see Fig. S1†) and intra- and inter-molecular interaction parameters of the PDI derivatives and solvent chloroform.47 Accordingly, the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) by Hartree–Fock theory and the basis set 6-31G* was adopted to fit the partial charges for the monomeric and dimeric PDIs.48–50 The MD simulations were carried out under the NPT ensemble using the leap-frog integrator with a time step of 1 fs. A Berendsen barostat51 and velocity rescaling thermostat52 with a relaxation time of 1.0 ps were applied to control the pressure and temperature under three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions, respectively. A spherical cutoff of 1.4 nm was set for the summation of van der Waals (VDW) interactions. A particle-mesh Ewald (PME) solver was used to compute the long-range Coulomb interactions with a cutoff of 1.0 nm and a tolerance of 1.0 × 10−5.
To imitate solution processing of PDI films, we first constructed a 20 × 20 × 20 nm3 box containing 200 monomeric or 100 dimeric PDI conformations and 50000 chloroform molecules by randomly dispersing PDI molecules in the solvent using the genbox utility of the Gromacs-4.6.7 package. To make the PDI and solvent molecules disperse homogeneously and the system relaxed, we ran a 500 ps equilibration under high pressure (100 bar) and then a 20 ns equilibration under normal pressure (1 bar) at 300 K. Then, a quasi-equilibrium approach was exploited to simulate solvent evaporation processes by randomly removing 100 solvent molecules every 200 ps from the solutions. These processes were held at a temperature of 300 K and a pressure of 1 bar with a compressibility of 1.0 × 10−4 bar−1. After removing all solvent molecules, the dried samples were further equilibrated for 30 ns at the same temperature and pressure but with a compressibility of 1.0 × 10−5 bar−1, followed by a 10 ns thermal annealing at 500 K (corresponding to the experimental melting points for perylenediimide derivatives53,54) and then a 10 ns equilibration at 300 K. The final box size is about 6.00 nm in three dimensions for all thin films. Lastly, an additional 30 ps equilibration was performed and 1000 snapshots were extracted every 30 fs for the following electronic coupling calculations.55
Electronic property and mobility calculations
The electronic couplings for the neighboring PDI pairs, which hold the shortest inter-atomic distance between the PDI units (excluding hydrogen atoms) less than 0.6 nm, were calculated using a semi-empirical method based on Zerner's intermediate neglect of differential overlap (ZINDO) Hamiltonian,56 which has demonstrated to be an efficient and reliable approach and suitable to deal with calculations on a large number of molecular pairs.55 Then the semi-classical Marcus electron transfer theory was used to estimate the electron transfer rates between neighboring PDI units and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations were performed to evaluate the diffusion coefficient to obtain electron mobilities (see the ESI† for more details).57–60 It should be noted that Wang et al. have developed surface hopping methods to study charge transport in recent years, which provide a general solution and can return to the approach used here in the hopping limit.61–64
Results and discussion
First, the geometric structures of the dimeric PDI derivatives are examined. As displayed in Fig. 2a and S2,† the optimized torsion angle between two PDI monomers is ca. 90° for the N–N linked dimeric PDI. In the case of the C–C linked dimeric PDI, there are two local energy minima with the torsion angle corresponding to ca. 60° and 130°, respectively. Compared to the N–N linked dimer, the two PDI monomers are much closer to each other in the C–C linked dimer, especially for the geometry with the obtuse torsion angle. As seen from Fig. S3,† the LUMO of PDI exhibits a significant electronic distribution on the bay C atoms but no distribution on the imide N atoms. Consequently, the electron transfer integral is increased from only several meV for the N–N linked dimer to tens of or even over a hundred meV for the C–C linked dimer. In the chloroform solutions, the dihedral angles between the PDI monomers show the same Gaussian distributions for different alkyl substitutions; the distribution centers correspond well to the optimized geometries (Fig. 2b). In the solid film, the distributions get broader due to intermolecular interactions; although DN1 and DN2 still have the same distributions, appreciable difference is found between DC1 and DC2 (Fig. 2c). The proportion of the obtuse dihedral angles (ca. 130°) is obviously increased for DC1 but slightly decreased for DC2, indicating a subtle role of alkyl side chains in tuning the conjugated backbone conformations.

Now, we analyze the intermolecular packing in the films of the PDI derivatives. The solvent evaporation processes of the PDI/chloroform solutions and the molecular packing morphologies of the annealed films are shown in Fig. S4 and S5.† Compared with the other PDI compounds, M1 prefers to form π–π aggregates during solvent evaporation. Thus the M1 film shows ordered molecular packing, verified by the center-of-mass (COM) radial distribution function (RDF) of PDI moieties (Fig. 3a). In the case of M1, a pronounced RDF peak is found at ca. 0.38 nm, corresponding to a typical π–π stacking distance in solid-state PDIs;65 in addition, considerable second- and third-order peaks appear at ca. 0.72 and 1.08 nm, respectively, suggesting long-range π–π stacks in the M1 film (Fig. S6†). Owing to stronger steric hindrance of the branched alkyl groups, M2 molecules assemble into isolated crossed π–π stacking dimers, reflected by a single attenuated RDF peak at ca. 0.38 nm. The simulated aggregation characteristics of M1 and M2 are consistent with nanobelt morphologies of linear alkyl PDIs and nanosphere morphologies of branched alkyl PDIs observed by atomic force microscopy.66 Similar to M2, intermolecular PDI units of DN2 tend to form crossed π–π stacking due to the steric hindrance of branched alkyl chains and twisted PDI moieties; this π–π RDF peak is associated with another broad peak at ca. 1.16 nm arising from the other PDI moieties of DN2. Also, both PDI units of one DN2 molecule can interact with other DN2 molecules, thus facilitating multiple DN2 molecules to gather into a large connection network. In sharp contrast, because of triple and severe steric hindrance from the branched alkyl chains on two imide ends and the twisted PDI unit at the bay position, the PDI units are impossible to arrange in any π–π mode for DC2. As indicated by the absence of intermolecular RDF peaks in Fig. 3a, the DC2 film morphology is fully disordered and isotropic. As expected, replacement of the branched with linear alkyl groups can increase π–π stacking. Nevertheless, the π–π stacking in the DC1 film is less than that in the DN2 film. In the case of dimeric PDIs, there exists a single intramolecular RDF peak, corresponding to the distance between two PDI monomers (Fig. S7†). To obtain an in-depth insight into the molecular packing structures and local ordering, the number of π–π stacks (Nπ–π) is evaluated for each PDI film (Fig. 3b). According to the RDFs, a pair of PDI units can be roughly regarded as π–π stacking if the COM distance between PDI units <0.5 nm. Obviously, the Nπ–π is reduced when replacing the linear with branched alkyl chains, especially from M1 to M2. In addition, the decrease of Nπ–π upon dimerization is more apparent for the bay C–C bonding mode than the imide N–N bonding mode. These results are fully consistent with the RDF trends. By and large, creating twisted structures through dimerization and/or introducing branched alkyl chains can effectively prevent long-range π–π aggregation in the PDI films.

To further illustrate the interconnection of PDI units through the bulk films, the number of neighboring PDI units is calculated for each PDI unit according to the shortest inter-atomic distance between the PDI units (excluding hydrogen atoms). Compared to the monomeric PDIs, the dimeric PDIs hold an additional intrinsic neighbor due to intramolecular connections. Fig. 4 displays the average number of neighbors from intermolecular PDI units. As expected, the number of neighbors is obviously increased after replacing the branched with linear alkyl chains owing to smaller steric hindrance. Upon dimerization through the bay C–C bonding, the number of intermolecular neighbors within the first shell (the shortest inter-atomic distance < two fold of the van der Waals radius of a C atom, ca. 3.5 Å) is slightly decreased for the branched alkyl substituted PDIs (M2 → DC2), or hardly changed for the linear alkyl substituted PDIs (M1 → DC1). In contrast, the number of intermolecular neighbors is significantly increased due to half reduction of alkyl chains upon dimerization through the imide N–N bonding. We note that a continuous and robust percolation network can be formed when the number of neighbors >2 (the number of intermolecular neighbors >1 for the dimeric PDIs). According to Fig. 4, as the distance increases, a continuous percolation network will be formed firstly for the N–N dimeric PDIs and DC1 at ca. 3.1 Å, then for DC2 at ca. 3.2 Å, for M1 at ca. 3.3 Å, and lastly for M2 at ca. 3.4 Å (Fig. S8†). Therefore, although the π–π stacking is effectively suppressed by dimerization, other short contacts between intermolecular PDI units become more intensive. Considering the additional intramolecular connection, the percolation network becomes better for the dimeric PDIs.

Next, the transfer integrals for electron transport have been calculated for the neighboring PDI pairs within 6 Å in the films. To consider the effect of thermal fluctuation, 1000 snapshots of the films are used to derive the average and variance of transfer integrals (Fig. 5). In the case of intermolecular PDI pairs, the variance of transfer integrals is comparable to or larger than the average for all the PDI derivatives, indicating that thermal fluctuation is expected to play an important role in electron transport for the PDI derivatives. After replacing the branched with linear alkyl chains, the number of intermolecular PDI pairs with strong transfer integrals is increased, especially for the monomeric and the C–C dimeric PDI compounds that have alkyl chains at both imide ends of the PDI units. As expected, the number of intermolecular PDI pairs with appreciable electronic couplings for the N–N linked dimer is more than that for the C–C linked dimer in the case of the same type of alkyl chains. For the intramolecular PDI pairs of the dimeric PDIs, the transfer integrals are little influenced by different alkyl chains; in addition, the variance is small relative to the average in almost all the cases. Compared to the transfer integrals of intermolecular PDI pairs, the transfer integrals of intramolecular PDI pairs are moderate for the N–N dimeric PDIs, but very strong for the C–C dimeric PDIs. Thus the interplay between intermolecular and intramolecular electronic interactions would be crucial to determine the electron transport of the dimeric PDI films.

Finally, the electron mobilities for the PDI films have been estimated in the framework of the charge diffusion model in combination with the semi-classical Marcus charge transfer theory, considering that electronic couplings are small relative to reorganization energies. Consistent with our previous work,67 thermal fluctuation is found to significantly increase the electron mobilities of the PDI films due to the large variance of transfer integrals (Fig. 6); the smallest increase appears to be ca. 2 fold for the N–N dimeric PDIs and the largest increase is over 4 fold for M1. In contrast, the role of static disorder of site energies is negligible in the electron transport of the PDI films (Fig. S9†). The electron mobilities are hardly changed or only slightly decreased, which can be attributed to small disorder of site energies for the fully fused rigid backbone of the PDI units (Fig. S10†).
 Fig. 6  Electron mobilities estimated without/with consideration of thermal fluctuation induced variance of transfer integrals for the films of the studied PDI derivatives. 
After replacing the branched with linear alkyl chains, the electron mobilities are nearly one order of magnitude increased for the monomeric (M2 → M1) PDIs and the C–C dimeric PDIs (DC2 → DC1) due to significant improvement of intermolecular connectivity and electronic interactions. Since the number of alkyl chains is already substantially reduced in DN2, the mobility increase (ca. 2 fold) is much attenuated from DN2 to DN1. It is noteworthy that dimerization can also lead to different degrees of improvement of electron mobilities. Compared with M2, the electron mobility of DC2 is increased 2 fold due to strong intramolecular electronic interactions. As mentioned above, both intramolecular and intermolecular connections are increased from the monomeric to N–N dimeric PDIs. As expected, the mobility of DN2 is much improved (by 5 fold) with respect to M2, which is consistent with the results measured by using field effect transistors.10 The space-charge limit current measurements also show higher electron mobility for DN2 than DC2.21 However, the mobility increase of DN1 relative to M1 (only ca. 40%) is very limited, which can be ascribed to the moderate electronic couplings between intramolecular PDIs in DN1. Notably, primarily owing to the extra effective intramolecular connection, the bay C–C dimerization can result in a 2-fold increase of electron mobilities. Then DC1 exhibits the highest electron mobility among all the PDI derivatives, which is ca. 20 fold increased with respect to the lowest one of M2 by simultaneously enhancing intermolecular and intramolecular interactions.
Conclusions
To summarize, we have systematically investigated the influence of dimerization and alkyl functionalization on the molecular packing and electron transport properties of the PDI derivatives. Our results indicate that long range π–π stacking can be effectively prevented by branched alkyl substitution and/or dimerization. As expected, branched alkyl substitution results in the reduction of short intermolecular contacts and thus lower electron mobilities. However, the intermolecular connection is hardly reduced or even increased upon dimerization; in addition, dimerization brings an extra intramolecular connection, leading to improved electron mobilities. Particularly, the bay C–C dimeric PDI with the linear alkyl chains shows the highest electron mobility due to both strong intermolecular and intramolecular interactions while the π–π stacking is mostly prohibited. These findings would be very helpful for the rational design of electron acceptors based on multiple covalently linked PDI moieties (and other electron deficient units) for organic photovoltaics.
