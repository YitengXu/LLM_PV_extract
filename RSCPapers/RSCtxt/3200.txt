    , Accepted 31st August 2018First published on 3rd September 2018AbstractGeneration of hydrogen is one of the greatest challenges nowadays, especially chemically obtaining from the simple, straightforward borohydride hydrolysis reaction. Herein we are interested in this reaction for producing hydrogen using various nanocatalysts which are derived from graphene (reduced graphene oxide, rGO) and combined with metal-based nanoparticles (Ag, Ni and Ni(OH)2). Overall, four promising catalysts were obtained using the liquid–liquid interfacial route in order to obtain highly homogeneous thin films. We highlight the novelty in employing thin films for the generation of hydrogen gas, in which the reaction kinetics was thoroughly elucidated, obeying first-order profiles. In fact, very high catalytic activity was observed using low amounts of nanocatalysts (∼0.1–0.8 mg), with the maximum rate of hydrogen production reaching nearly 33 × 103 mL−1 min−1 g−1. rGO/Ni nanocomposites are reported here for the first time, which also showed the most prominent activity. The isolated components alone were not efficient, evidencing the synergism in the nanocomposites produced. Finally, the nanocatalysts were recycled for up to 10 consecutive cycles, without losing activity. Various characterization techniques were performed during the reactions and after the reuse and confirmed that the typical nature of the composites remains intact.
Introduction
Since the early 19th century, scientists have identified hydrogen (H2) gas as a potential energy vector. Its combustion has the highest heating value compared to other fuels, and employing it in fuel cell leads to obtaining water as a by-product, which is highly environmentally friendly.1,2 Most of the H2 produced at the industrial scale is obtained using the steam reforming process or as a by-product of petroleum refining. However, both methods have limitations or high environmental drawbacks. Recently, various methods have been applied for the production of H2 such as fuel cells, electrolysis, solar generators, biomass conversion, photocatalysis, electrolysis coupled with photovoltaics, and thermochemical water splitting and hydrolysis reactions.3–5 The latter are still poorly exploited despite their simple, straightforward and highly sustainable approach, i.e. a chemical reaction not involving very hazardous substances, under mild conditions (ambient) and without significant energy input (in contrast to electrolysis for example). Moreover, most of the methods for H2 generation rely on catalysts based on noble metals such as Au,6 Pt7 and Ru.8 Such metals are expensive, thus limiting their use and application on a large scale. A promising alternative is the use of cheaper materials, such as Co9 and Ni,10 supported on organic matrices, which increases the surface area and consequently increases the catalytic performance, but these methods can still present drawbacks such as high cost or handling difficulty.
In this context, a new class of catalysts that benefit from synergism using graphene derivatives combined with various metal-based nanoparticles (NPs) emerges, presenting a high catalytic activity increase for several reactions11–14 due to exceptional optical,15 mechanical16 and electronic properties.14 Graphene stands out as a promising scaffold for nanocatalysts because it has, among several interesting properties, high surface area,17 adsorption capacity18 and electronic properties.14 In fact, when combined with NPs, unique improved characteristics can be obtained, in contrast to isolated precursors. This has been furnished in many studies towards novel nanocomposites, for example graphene with NPs for H2 generation, using TiO2,19 CdS,20,21 ZnS,22 Cu2O,23 and Ni,24 among others.
While seeking applications, various concerns arise. For example, controlling and modulating the H2 production rate is technologically important for safety reasons. Related to this is the need to be able to project any interruption during the generation, if desired. Surely a thorough elucidation of the reaction kinetics of these processes can be greatly insightful. Another important issue to address is how to handle these nanocomposites (e.g., powder), which can be limiting. In the past few years, some of us have demonstrated that thin films obtained from the liquid–liquid (L/L) interfacial method have emerged as a promising alternative.25–27 By this route, nanocomposites (derived from graphene and polymers/NPs) can be easily self-assembled at the water/toluene interface and further deposited as highly homogeneous thin films with great adherence to any substrate of interest, allowing their direct application, for example, as energy devices,25 sensors,28 catalysts for organophosphate cleavage26 and SERS substrates.26 Most recently, two novel routes have been reported for obtaining thin film nanocomposites of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and Ag29 or Ni(OH)2 (ref. 28) NPs. The first one consists in the concomitant formation of Ag NPs and rGO using sodium borohydride as the reducing agent at the water/toluene interface.29 The second one is the polyol method, in which the material is obtained in a single step and where ethylene glycol acts as a solvent, reducing agent and stabilizer for the NPs.28
Among the several possible applications of these thin film materials described above, the production of H2 has not been explored. Thus, Ag nanocomposites have shown to be excellent SERS substrates,29 while with Ni(OH)2, multiple applications such as batteries, electrochromic devices and glycerol electrochemical sensors have been reported.28 Herein, we are interested in broadening the application of Ag and Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites for H2 production. Furthermore, a novel graphene/Ni nanocomposite (rGO/Ni) is described, which is also applied and evidenced the most promising results. Overall, four thin film nanocomposites were obtained from graphene and Ag, Ni or Ni(OH)2 NPs that promote the borohydride hydrolysis reaction. The nanocatalysts evaluated show among the highest catalytic activities ever reported, with remarkable recycling features, up to 10 cycles. A thorough kinetics analysis is also carried out in order to guide the understanding of the catalytic activity and also for comparison with the literature.
Experimental section
All reagents were used without pre-treatment: 99.8% AgNO3 (Sigma-Aldrich), 98% NaBH4 (Acros), 99% toluene (Neon), 95–98% H2SO4 (Carlo Erba), graphite (Graflake 99580, 99%, Nacional de Grafite SA), 99% NaNO3 (Vetec), 99% KMnO4 (Synth), 37% HCl (Impex), 30% H2O2 aqueous solution (Vetec), 99.5% ethylene glycol (Carlo Erba), glycerol (CAAL) and 98% NaOH (Vetec). Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O (Vetec) was previously dried under low pressure at 100 °C for 5 hours before use. All solutions were prepared with deionized Milli-Q water.
Synthesis and characterization of the nanocomposites
GO was synthesized according to a modified Hummers' method described before.30 For the synthesis of the nanocomposites of Ni/Ni(OH)2 and rGO, the polyol method was employed which was fully described previously for rGO/Ni(OH)2,28 although it is reported herein for the first time for rGO/Ni. Briefly, two approaches were adopted starting from GO and Ni acetate as precursors using two temperatures, 190 and 198 °C, which lead to rGO/Ni(OH)2 and rGO/Ni, respectively. The mass proportion used was 1:1 and 1:0.5 (GO:Ni) for rGO/Ni(OH)2 and rGO/Ni, respectively. As mentioned, for rGO/Ni(OH)2, the synthesis has already been described28 so herein we specify in more detail the novel synthesis of rGO/Ni. For this, 5 mg of GO were dispersed in 20 mL of ethylene glycol using an ultrasonic bath for 60 min. Upon addition of Ni acetate, the system was refluxed for 2 h at 198 °C. At the end of this period, the material was filtered, washed with 200 mL of deionized water and dried at 70 °C for 1 h. For obtaining the thin films, 1 mg of rGO/Ni(OH)2 or rGO/Ni was added to a round bottom flask containing 40 mL of deionized Milli-Q water and dispersed with the assistance of an ultrasonic bath for 1 h. Then, 40.0 mL of toluene was added to the flask and the system was stirred (2500 rpm) for 12 hours, in which upon stirring interruption, the film spontaneously migrated to the L/L interface. This film was transferred with the aid of a micropipette to a 100 mL beaker containing water, toluene and the substrate of interest. As the thin film is self-assembled, it reorganizes itself at the L/L interface, which is removed by pulling the substrate toward the interface using a homemade dip-coating equipment,31 aiming a steady and homogeneous deposition. Subsequently, the films were oven-dried at 70 °C for 1 h.
The nanocomposites with Ag were synthetized as described previously,29 and the main difference from the Ni-based materials given above is that with Ag, the thin films were obtained directly from the L/L interfacial reaction medium. Hence, the synthesis of the nanocomposites as well as the deposition of the films is obtained in a one-pot system. In summary, AgNO3 was reacted in a water/toluene system with two different carbon precursors GO and rGO, which led to the nanocomposites rGO1/Ag and rGO2/Ag, respectively. The mass proportion adopted was 1:5 (GO:AgNO3) and 1:2 (rGO:AgNO3) for obtaining rGO1/Ag and rGO2/Ag, respectively. For the reduction process, NaBH4 was used. After the reaction occurs, a film is assembled at the interface. Both the aqueous and organic phases were repeatedly washed (10 times) by replacing with fresh water/toluene with the aid of a micropipette. Finally, for obtaining the film, the same procedure described for the Ni-derived composites was carried out, i.e., the film is transferred to a beaker and further deposited. An overall summary of the samples obtained is shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the synthesis of the nanocomposites and their application for hydrogen production. Photographs are also shown for the thin films deposited over glass and during the hydrogen production stage. 
Likewise, thin films of the nanocomposites of solely Ag, Ni or Ni(OH)2 NPs were also obtained for comparison purposes, following the analogous procedures given above, although their films did not present themselves homogeneously. A film of rGO was also obtained for comparison, as described in the literature.29
For the characterization, the thermal analysis (TG) measurements were performed on a TGA/SDT Q600, under a synthetic air atmosphere, with a heating ramp of 5 °C min−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed using Shimadzu XRD-6000 equipment, with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å), operating at 40 kV voltage and 30 mA current, directly on the films deposited over the glass substrate. A low-angle accessory was used in order to minimize the contribution of the substrate. Raman spectra were collected using a Renishaw spectrophotometer equipped with an optical microscope with a spatial resolution of 1 μm (50× lens). The excitation lines used were He–Ne (632.8 nm) and Ar+ (514.5 nm) with an incidence power less than 1 mW, in a total of 15 accumulations (10 s per accumulation). All spectra were recorded with the films deposited on Si/SiO2 substrates. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected using a FEG-SEM Tescan, with a voltage of 10 kV and secondary electron detector. For these analyses the films were deposited on Si/SiO2.
H2 production
The catalytic hydrolysis of NaBH4 was carried out by immersing the thin films in the reaction medium: rGO1/Ag, rGO2/Ag, rGO/Ni(OH)2 and rGO/Ni deposited over glass (both sides) with a total area of 15 cm2. Firstly, NaBH4 (227.2 mg) was dissolved in 40.0 mL deionized water in a closed vessel and the system was kept under stirring (1000 rpm). Then the film was placed in the solution, and the generated gas (H2) was collected in an inverted measuring cylinder, containing water, immersed in a 2.0 L beaker, and the volume of water displaced was related to the amount of gas produced. Ambient temperature was maintained at 21 °C. Fig. 1 illustrates the H2 production. The system was completely isolated in order to guarantee that all the gas produced is collected. The amount of H2 produced (volume) was measured as a function of time and further used for the kinetics studies. The kinetics profiles were fitted using the program Origin, by non-linear regressions using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm to find the least squares sum. A detailed description of the equations fitted is further discussed in the Results section.
For the recycling study, the film was removed from the vessel, followed by washing and drying. Then it was reused consecutively as described above in a reaction medium containing fresh NaBH4. The characterization (SEM, Raman, and XRD) carried out at varying reaction times (1 h, 3 h, 6 h and 12 h) required an individual synthesis for each measurement. For this, the thin film was removed from the solution and dried at 60 °C for 1 h.
Results and discussion
Characterization of the nanocomposites
The nanocomposites were thoroughly characterized, and the results fully agree with previous reports of those composites already described.28,29Fig. 2 highlights most of the relevant characterization data for the Ni-based nanocomposites. XRD patterns show peaks at 42.5° and 51.6° for rGO/Ni, correlated to the sets of planes (111) and (200) of the face-centred cubic structure of Ni (Fig. 2A). For rGO/Ni(OH)2, the peaks at 7.7°, 14.5°, 34.4° and 60.5° were depicted, relative to planes (001), (002), (100) and (110), respectively, of the α-Ni(OH)2 structure (Fig. 2C).28

The rGO peak is present at 23.1° relative to the plane (002).32 In fact, the difference in the reaction temperature is responsible for the structural modification observed within the Ni-derived materials. SEM images evidence the presence of the typical wrinkled sheets of rGO. For rGO/Ni (Fig. 2B), it is possible to depict a surface coated with Ni microparticles with a size of 0.5 to 40 μm, which are actually composed of aggregated smaller particles (nanometric scale). In the case of rGO/Ni(OH)2, the NPs are not distinguished, although this is expected.28 Further TGA, SEM/EDS and Raman analysis of rGO/Ni are given in the ESI.†

Fig. 3 presents some of the most important characterization data for the Ag-derived nanocomposites. XRD confirms the formation of the Ag NPs in rGO1/Ag and rGO2/Ag due to the presence of 38.0° and 44.2° peaks, which are related to the crystalline planes (111) and (200), respectively, of the face-centred cubic Ag (Fig. 3A).29 UV-Vis spectra (Fig. 3B) taken using a quartz substrate show for rGO a band at 270 nm due to the π–π* transition of aromatic CC.33 In the nanocomposites, an additional band is observed which is related to the Ag plasmon band, commonly found at approximately 400 nm, but for rGO2/Ag is centred at 340 nm. This displacement may be related to the shape of the NPs, size or even the interaction with rGO.29 SEM images (Fig. 3C and D) show rGO sheets with homogeneously distributed Ag NPs. In some cases, it is possible to verify Ag agglomerates.

In summary, all the characterization data indicate the successful synthesis of the four nanocomposites derived from rGO and Ag/Ni/Ni(OH)2 NPs, which displayed different morphologies. It is important to note that these nanocomposites rely on the passivating effect of rGO on the NPs formed. Indeed, the results have shown that the carbon precursors (GO and rGO) can act as nucleating sites for the growth of various NPs, thus controlling their size, distribution and shape. In many cases, this approach has shown optimized properties due to synergistic effects and broadened applications.26,28,29 Henceforth, we applied the nanocomposites for an imperative application: H2 production.
H2 production
The production of H2 was carried out by promoting the borohydride hydrolysis, shown in reaction (1). The volume of H2 produced was monitored as a function of time, and the kinetics profiles obtained are shown in Fig. 4, along with those of rGO for comparison. Another important comparison is with bare NPs (without rGO), which didn't show any significant activity. BH4−(aq) + 2H2O(l) → BO2−(aq) + 4H2(g)(1)
 Fig. 4  Volume of H2 produced vs. time, from the borohydride reaction promoted by the nanocatalysts (∼0.12–0.77 mg). The solid lines correspond to the fit using eqn 2. 
It is possible to evidence from Fig. 4 that the volume of H2 produced was higher for all nanocomposites compared to rGO, despite it still presenting some activity. In all cases, the amount of nanocatalyst employed is very low (∼0.12–0.77 mg). Actually, rGO/Ni showed the greatest behaviour producing nearly 400 mL of H2 in just 5 h. A similar H2 volume was also obtained with rGO1/Ag but with a higher reaction time. The catalytic behaviour among the Ag-materials can be related to the amount of Ag used in the synthesis which is higher for rGO1/Ag, which in fact produced more H2. For the Ni-materials, rGO/Ni(OH)2 showed lower activity that is probably related to the stability of Ni(OH)2, which can be reduced to metallic Ni under the reaction conditions.
Interpreting the kinetics of H2 production is a great challenge nowadays. Different mechanisms for hydrolysis of borohydride catalysed by metallic NPs have been widely discussed with several kinetic models proposed: zero order, first order, second-order, power law, Langmuir–Hinshelwood, Michaelis–Menten and semi-empirical kinetics.34 According to Rangel et al.34 the order of the reaction can change according to the molar ratio of borohydride/catalysts: high ratios lead to zero-order kinetics,35,36 and low ratios lead to first-order kinetics.37 All the previously highlighted mechanisms present two important steps: (i) adsorption of borohydride on the surface of the catalyst and (ii) reaction of the adsorbed species on the catalyst surface. The first step is characterized by the BH4− ions being chemisorbed on the Ni/Ag metal atoms, and then the H− is transferred from BH4− to the metal atom, forming H− (hydridic). This species reacts with a water molecule to produce H2 and OH−, and the latter reacts with B to produce BH3(OH)−.38 The higher catalytic activity of the materials with NPs is usually correlated to the higher superficial area and the increase of electron density. In addition, the effect of graphene-based supports on these reactions is usually attributed to improving charge transfer and increasing the specific surface area.9
Although data in Fig. 4 consistently evidence the high efficiency of the nanocatalysts, we were further interested in elucidating the kinetics profiles and also comparing with other data in the literature. Indeed, these comparisons can be tricky because the volume of H2 produced, the time/rate required and the mass of the catalyst used should be considered. Due to this, herein we present different approaches for analysing the data which are thoroughly described as follows. Based on the literature, two different methods were used to evaluate and compare the H2 production with other studies: (i) method 1 considers the rate constant from first order kinetics, combined with the volume of H2 produced and mass of the catalysts;37 (ii) method 2 considers only the time in which the greatest volume of H2 is produced and is also related to the mass of the catalyst. More specifically, for method 1, the kinetic profiles given in Fig. 4 were fitted according to first order equations. As previously deduced,37 the authors have shown that eqn (2) can be successfully fitted in volume vs. time profiles, where VH2(t) is the volume of H2 at a certain time t, VH2Max is the maximum volume of H2 produced and k is the rate constant. The fit curves (Fig. 4) show good correlations giving the k values of 0.010, 0.0029, 0.0044 and 0.016 min−1 for rGO/Ni, rGO1/Ag, rGO/NiOH2 and rGO2/Ag, respectively. Furthermore, for employing the comparison method 1, the maximum rate of H2 production (MRP, in units of mL−1 min−1 g−1) defined by a mathematical treatment37 can be calculated using eqn (3), where VH2t is the total volume of H2 produced in the reaction, k is the rate constant obtained from the kinetics profile and mcat is the total mass of the catalyst used. (2)
Method 1 (3)
The value of MRP was calculated for the nanocomposites evaluated herein as well as for other studies reported in the literature that obey first order kinetics. Fig. 5 shows the results obtained here (highlighted with asterisk) along with data from other studies, for example, Co–B nanoparticles,37 2D nitrogenated polymer encapsulated Co3O4 (Co3O4@C2N),39 ionic liquid functionalized graphene oxide with CuO (rO/IL/Cu)40 and graphene Co–Zn–B nanocomposites (Co–Zn–B/G).41 In fact, Co-based materials seem to be very promising for H2 generation, evidenced by the many reports involving them. Nonetheless, the nanocomposites evaluated herein present very high activity with their MRP values being among the highest, especially for rGO/Ni. This impressive activity can be ascribed to several effects such as the low mass of the catalyst used which is homogeneously distributed over the substrate due to the L/L interfacial method and synergistic effect between rGO and the NPs that favour rapid kinetics (high k and volume) for the reaction of interest.
 Fig. 5  Values of MRP (eqn (3)) for the borohydride hydrolysis promoted by the nanocatalysts (*) and compared with data from the literature – Co–B,37 Co3O4@C2N,39 GO/IL/Cu40 and Co–Zn–B/G.41 
Calculation of MRP is an important tool for understanding the H2 production kinetics, although its comparison to other data in the literature is limited since studies solely obeying first order kinetics can be used. Due to this, another widely used method was also applied,42 namely method 2. For this, the optimal production (OP) of H2 was estimated considering eqn (4), where VH2op is the maximum volume of H2 produced during the reaction at a given optimal time top. For example, in the case of rGO/Ni, this optimal condition is ∼400 mL with 5 h. Although this method doesn't consider the kinetics profile fitting, it has the advantage of broadening comparison with other studies that present varying kinetic behaviours (order) or when the kinetics are not followed. Thus, this is an attempt to compare the “best” results of H2 production (volume generated) of a given study, normalized by the time required to overcome this and also the mass of the catalyst. Table 1 presents an overall comparison of various OP values calculated using method 2 for the nanocatalysts herein and others reported in the literature. Analysis of Table 1 shows that the 4 nanocatalysts evaluated present among the greatest values of OP. When comparing with similar components of our nanocatalysts (carbon nanomaterials or Ag/Ni NPs), the results stand out, with an exception of the catalyst Pt/Pd atoms on CNT paper.41 Although this material shows high activity, its preparation is not so feasible, i.e., it requires a monolayer elemental dispersion of Pt and Pd atoms on coated/functionalized carbon nanotube paper.43 In addition, this study considers solely the mass of the metal as mcat, which is very low, compared to the total mass of the catalysts, as considered herein. Notwithstanding, both methods 1 (MRP) and 2 (OP) strongly support that the nanocatalysts proposed herein present very high catalytic activities towards H2 production (Fig. 5 and Table 1). The distinguished catalytic activity between Ag and Ni-based materials could be explained by the different interaction forces of Ag and Ni with H2, which although is not the focus of the present study, have been extensively discussed elsewhere.44,45 Another important factor could be associated with the morphological difference of the NPs.

Method 2 (4)

Fig. 6 summarizes some results regarding the reuse of the rGO/Ni nanocatalyst, including OP values over the cycles, photographs and SEM images of the films before and after the reaction, and XRD patterns taken during the reaction. XRD patterns obtained at different reaction times during the borohydride hydrolysis do not evidence any significant change in the material, which is desired (Fig. 6A). Similar conclusions were obtained from SEM and Raman analyses obtained analogously for rGO/Ni and the other nanocatalysts (shown in the ESI†).

A recycling study was also carried out for all the nanocomposites, in which the same thin film was reused for up to 10 cycles in different reactions. For all the nanocatalysts, the value of OP observed in the first cycle was overall maintained in the consecutive cycles (see ESI), and we highlight the most representative results for rGO/Ni, which was reused 10 times (Fig. 6B). For example, for rGO/Ni, 365 and 335 mL of H2 were produced in the first and fifth cycles, respectively. On analysing the OP values, we observe 3.0, 4.5 and 6.0 × 104 mL min−1 g−1 for the first, fifth and tenth cycles, respectively, evidencing no significant loss of activity. Fig. 6C–E indicate that the overall characteristics of the film/material are maintained comparing analysis before and after the reaction. It should be noted that in the case of rGO/Ni(OH)2, its activity varied (∼30%) within the cycles probably due to the reduction of the NPs during the reaction. Surely, recycling is one of the great advantages of the thin film nanocatalysts, along with its easily handling. Hence, after the completion of the reaction, the thin film can be removed from the reaction medium and reused in consecutive cycles simply by washing, drying and re-immersing in a new reaction medium. Indeed, this film is strongly adhered to the substrate and thus is not lixiviated to the solution, as proven by characterization data recorded after the reaction (film and solution). Finally, it can be concluded that this thin film addresses several stability and safety issues, since it can be easily handled and removed from the medium. In addition, the production of H2 can be strategically controlled. Therefore, a more controlled production can be obtained by using for example rGO/Ni(OH)2 or the Ag-derived nanocatalysts. However, higher volumes in shorter periods could be projected using rGO/Ni. In addition, any necessary interruption in the generation of H2 can be easily achieved in the proposed system, which is highly important to address safety issues, simply by raising the thin film out of the borohydride solution.
Conclusions
In summary, a new class of thin film nanocatalysts derived from rGO and Ag, Ni or Ni(OH)2 NPs is proposed for promoting borohydride hydrolysis for H2 production, using small amounts of the nanocatalysts (∼0.12–0.77 mg). The nanocomposites were easily obtained by the L/L interfacial method with the advantage of producing highly homogeneous films. A total of four nanocatalysts were obtained, of which the synthesis of rGO/Ni is reported here for the first time. All the nanocatalysts show very high catalytic activity for H2 generation, which is not observed for the components alone, i.e. for bare rGO or Ag/Ni/Ni(OH)2 NPs. This pronounced activity can be attributed to the synergistic effects of the components and due to the homogeneously distributed thin film. The kinetics profiles were obtained, which obeyed first-order equations. Seeking a comprehensive understanding of the activity for comparing with the literature, two methods were proposed for calculating the catalytic activity of the nanocatalysts that consider (i) the kinetics of the reaction and (ii) optimal volume of H2 produced. Using both methods, the nanocatalysts herein show among the greatest behaviour reported, highlighting rGO/Ni as the best material for H2 production, with a value of the maximum rate of H2 production of nearly 33 × 103 mL−1 min−1 g−1. The recycling feature of the nanocatalysts was also proven, evidencing that the films can be reused for up to 10 consecutive cycles. Characterization techniques were also performed during the H2 generation reaction and after the reaction, and indicated that the nanocatalysts retain their overall nature throughout the reaction. Therefore, we believe that the results presented consistently evidence the potential of thin films as well as the materials adopted. Nanocomposites of carbon-based materials with metallic NPs have long shown many promising applications, and we show that for the less exploited borohydride hydrolysis, it could also be efficiently employed. Moreover, we believe that the kinetics study complements the discussion of these known complex reactions and could help guide towards a more concise understanding of the catalytic activity. In addition, the catalyst composition can greatly tune the kinetics as observed by varying the NP nature (Ag, Ni and Ni(OH)2). The amount of H2 produced and the time required can be modulated according to needs. Moreover, the feasibility of handling the catalysts and of interrupting the production is also an important safety issue, which we also observed in our systems.
