    , Accepted 26th March 2019First published on 27th March 2019AbstractDeveloping efficient anode materials with low electrode voltage, high specific capacity and superior rate capability is urgently required on the road to commercially viable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Aiming at finding a new SIB anode material, we investigate the electrochemical properties of NaxTiO2 compounds with unprecedented penta-oxygen-coordinated trigonal bipyramid (TB) structures by using first-principles calculations. Identifying the four different TB phases, we perform the optimization of their crystal structures and calculate their energetics such as sodium binding energy, formation energy, electrode potential and activation energy for Na ion migration. The computations reveal that the TB-I phase is the best choice among the four TB phases for a SIB anode material due to a relatively low volume change of under 4% upon Na insertion, low electrode voltage under 1.0 V with a possibility of realizing the highest specific capacity of ∼335 mA h g−1 from full sodiation at x = 1, and reasonably low activation barriers under 0.35 eV at the Na content from x = 0.125 to x = 0.5. Through the analysis of electronic density of states and charge density difference upon sodiation, we find that the NaxTiO2 compounds in TB phases change from electron insulating to electron conducting materials due to the electron transfer from Na atoms to Ti ions, offering the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple for SIB operation.
1 Introduction
Along with the depletion of fossil fuels and serious concerns regarding global warming, the ever growing energy demand in human life and industry highlights the importance of exploiting sustainable and natural clean energy sources such as solar and wind power.1,2 Due to the intermittent character of natural energy sources, the energy harvesting or conversion devices should be paired with large-scale energy storage systems typically including rechargeable batteries.3 For the batteries to be used in the grid, their component materials such as electrode and electrolyte need to be based on earth-abundant, environmentally benign and cost-effective resources. These requirements make the relatively expensive lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) less appealing due to the high cost and uneven distribution of lithium resources, despite their successful applications mostly in portable electronics and often in electric vehicles during the past decades.4,5 Therefore, the scientific interest has been shifted into developing non-lithium, so-called “post-lithium” batteries with lower cost and similar or even better performance.6 In this context, sodium-ion batterries (SIBs) have attracted attention as the most promising alternative to LIBs, due to their meeting the aforementioned requirements and having the same “rocking-chair” operational mechanism.7–9
Sodium, however, has a larger ionic radius than Li, which makes it difficult to find suitable electrode materials that can be de/intercalated with Na during the charge/discharge process, raising the problems of cycling stability and rate capability of the battery. For commercially viable SIBs, therefore, it is vital to develop stable and high-performance electrode materials.10,11 Although many candidates have been identified as promising cathode materials of SIBs, only a limited number of materials have been reported on the anode side so far. As the most widely used and standard anode material with a theoretical capacity of 372 mA h g−1 for LIBs, graphite was found to have a very low specific capacity of ∼35 mA h g−1 in SIBs, because it is impossible for Na to form low-stage graphite intercalation compounds due to a big mismatch between the ionic radius of the Na+ cation and the interlayer distance of graphite.12 Thus, Na co-intercalation with organic molecules into graphite has been devised, but the capacity is found to be still limited to ∼100 mA h g−1.13–16 So non-graphitic carbonaceous materials have been investigated. Hard carbon showed a significantly higher capacity of ∼300 mA h g−1 but with the shortcoming of low coulombic efficiency,17–19 while multilayered graphene and its composites have been proved to be able to be used as anodes but suffer from the weak binding of Na to the graphene sheet, resulting in Na clustering and dendrite growth.20–24 The graphene-like two-dimensional (2D) materials like transition metal dichalcogenides25–28 and oxides29 have been reported to have exceptionally high initial capacities based on the conversion and alloying reaction of the Na storage mechanism, such as 847 mA h g−1 for Na3.75Sn,30 660 mA h g−1 for Na3Sb31 and 386 mA h g−1 for Fe2O3. The amorphous red phosphor even shows a reversible capacity of over 2000 mA h g−1.32 But these materials suffer from fast fading capacity due to extremely large volume expansion and agglomeration of reaction products, and also from safety issues due to the formation of metal plates during the conversion reaction. In order to alleviate these problems, state-of-the-art nano technologies have been utilized, but such high-tech employment again impedes the scale-up to mass production of these materials.
The intercalation type materials can easily suppress such problems of cycling stability and safety issues due to their “rocking-chair” mechanism and thus further research to find better Na-intercalation compounds based on non-carbon materials is still in progress. Inter alia TiO2 polymorph can intercalate Na+ cations reversibly and thus can be used as a potential anode material for SIBs.33–39 The TiO2 nanoparticles with anatase,33 rutile34 and monoclinic phase35 were found to show reversible capacities of ∼100 mA h g−1, but whether they are based on the rocking-chair mechanism is still controversial due to their narrow interstitial space. Other TiO2 polymorphs with more open structures have shown higher reversible capacities of ∼150 mA h g−1, corresponding to electrochemical reversibility between Na0.5TiO2 and NaTiO2 in the O3-layered structure,36 and ∼280 mA h g−1 in the microporous hollandite-type structure.37 For the latter case, however, only 85 mA h g−1 was found to be reversible, implying that its microporous structure still cannot afford to host more than 0.25 Na per one formula unit (f.u.). Very recently, Ma et al.40 have identified a class of new microporous TiO2 crystal structures composed of unprecedented penta-oxygen-coordinated (TiO5) trigonal bipyramid (TB) building blocks, with a large amount of data from global potential energy surface calculations of TiO2. Interestingly, these TB structures have one-dimensional (1D) microporous channels with large pore sizes of 5.6–6.7 Å, and despite such porous structures, they were confirmed to have high mechanical and thermal stabilities from phonon calculation and molecular dynamics simulation. Sucha microporous and, at the same time, stable structural framework of TB phases might be favourable for ion intercalation and migration, and so the authors performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations, demonstrating that these compounds can be good anode materials for LIBs with the whole theoretical capcity of ∼335 mA h g−1 offered by the Ti3+/4+ redox couple. These microporous crystal structures of TiO2 can also be utilized in SIBs and even in the case of the emerging concept of multivalent-ion batteries using divalent (Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) or trivalent (Al3+) ions as charge carriers, although these materials are not yet reported to be synthesized.
In this work, we propose that TiO2 crystals with TB structures are highly promising anode materials for SIBs based on first-principles DFT calculations. Our calculation reveals that this unique microporous crystal structure can afford an exceptionally high reversible capacity of ∼335 mA h g−1 utilizing one Na ion intercalation into every TiO2 formula unit. Moreover, its electrode voltage appears to be as low as ∼0.56 V, indicating an increased energy density when used as an anode material, and the result on ion migration also supports the applicability of this compound as a SIB anode material.
2 Methods
2.1 Structures of TiO2 polymorphs with Na insertion
Titania has rich polymorphs from traditional bulky phases of rutile, anatase and brookite to layered porous phases such as ramsdellite- and hollandite-like structures. These titania phases can be characterized to be composed of TiO6 octahedra as their building blocks. As newly suggested by Ma et al.,40 there is another building block of titania polymorph, namely penta-oxygen-coordinated TiO5 trigonal bipyramid (TB). Fig. 1 shows typically the anatase, ramsdellite and TB structures projected onto the a–c plane in polyhedral view. As denoted by pink solid lines in this figure, these polymorphs look very similar in respect of Ti–Ti linkage, which is a hexagonal framework, but they are different with respect to the building blocks and their interconnections. In the anatase phase the TiO6 octahedra are connected by edge-sharing, forming a 3D channel inside the framework, while in the ramsdellite phase the octahedra are interconnected by edge- and corner-sharing, showing a tunnel-type 1D channel. In these phases, the channels are too narrow for any guest ion to intercalate, because the oxygen atoms are placed deep inside the framework of Ti–Ti linkages. In the TB structure, the TiO5 building blocks are interconnected by edge- and corner-sharing, forming a porous 1D channel with the oxygen atoms placed between Ti–Ti linkages when looked at in the direction of the channel, which can offer sufficient space for ion hosting and migration. It is worth noting that the pore size increases from anatase to ramsdellite and to TB phases.

There are four different crystalline phases from the TB building block40 (Fig. S1, ESI†), namely TB-I (orthorhombic, Imma), -II (orthorhombic, Cmcm), -III (tetragonal, I4/mmm), and -IV (orthorhombic, Imma). The TB-I and -II phases can be characterized to be composed of 6-membered rings of TiO5, while the TB-III and -IV phases contain 8- and 4-membered rings. As mentioned above, they have a common character of a 1D channel with the large pore sizes of 5.77 Å (TB-I), 5.65 Å (TB-II), 6.16 Å (TB-III) and 6.71 Å (TB-IV), which might be beneficial to the insertion and diffusion of alkali metal cations for ion battery applications. Contrary to our expectations, however, Li ions were found to place on the center of the walls of the channel instead of inside the channel and diffuse across the channel rather than along the channel.40
Such abnormal Li insertion sites and diffusion pathways can be understood by estimating and analyzing the bond valence sum (BVS) in TiO2 bulk phases.41–43Fig. 2 shows the isosurface of BVS with the values from 0.3 to 1.0 in the crystalline TiO2 TB-I phase. Since Li and Na ions can possess an oxidation state of +1 in compounds, they could be located on the isosurface of BVS = 1. In accordance with ref. 40 and as shown in Fig. 2(a), Li ions with smaller ionic radius are verified to be located on the center of two bridging oxygen anions in the channel wall. On the other hand, the insertion sites of Na ions with larger ionic radius are shown to be possibly inside the 1D channel and to migrate through the channel along the zigzag path by the BVS map for Na in Fig. 2(b). The BVS maps for Na in TB-II, -III and -IV are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). In the cases of TB-I and -II phases, two different Na sites are identified inside the 6-membered ring channel, while in the cases of TB-III and -IV phases four different sites are possible inside the 8-membered ring channel with the same zigzag migration paths. Accordingly, these four different TB phases have a potential to hold one Na ion per TiO2 formula unit inside the channel, resulting in an exceptionally high capacity of ∼335 mA h g−1. Such insertion sites and migration paths of Na ions roughly estimated from the BVS map should be rectified by DFT calculations. The conventional unit cells of TB phases contain 4TiO2 formula units in the TB-I phase and 8 formula units in the TB-II, -III and -IV phases, and thus a 2 × 1 × 1 supercell for the TB-I phase and the unit cells for the other phases, containing 8 formula units (24 atoms) consistently, were used in the DFT calculations. In order to perform simulations of Na insertion and diffusion, we built the unit cells for Na-intercalated titania NaxTiO2, which contain Na ions from 1 to 8, corresponding to from x = 0.125 to x = 1.

The identified insertion sites of Li and Na are illustrated as yellow- and pink-fillled circles with label A, and their migration paths are denoted as dashed lines. 
2.2 Computational details
The pseudopotential plane-wave method within the DFT framework was used to carry out first-principles calculations, as implemented in the Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) package (version 6.2).44 The project-augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials available from the PS Library 0.2.245 were used to describe the ion–electron interaction, and the revised version for solids of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional (PBEsol) within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)46 was used to describe the exchange–correlation (XC) interaction between the valence electrons. The wave functions of valence electrons and electronic densities were expanded by using the plane wave basis sets generated with the cut-off energies of 70 and 800 Ry, respectively. Special k-points were set to be (2 × 6 × 2) for structural optimization. These computational parameters guarantee a total energy accuracy of 5 meV per formula unit. The positions of all atoms and lattice parameters were fully relaxed until the atomic forces converge to 0.02 eV Å−1. For the calculations of density of states (DOS) and charge difference, denser k-points of (4 × 6 × 4) were used.
The migration paths and the corresponding activation energies for sodium ion migrations were determined by using the climbing image nudged elastic band (NEB) method47 as implemented in the neb.x code of the QE package. During the NEB run, the supercell lattice parameters were fixed at the optimized values, while all the atomic positions were allowed to relax. The seven NEB image points were used, and the convergence criterion for the force orthogonal to the path was set to be 0.05 eV Å−1.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Preliminary check of the XC functional
We first checked the reliability of the selected PBEsol XC functional with the crystalline lattice constants of the precedent rutile, anatase, hollandite and ramsdellite TiO2 phases determined by structural optimizations in comparison with those by PBE calculation and experiment. Table 1 presents their lattice constants calculated by using the PBEsol functional in this work and the PBE functional, together with the experimental values. The PBEsol functional was confirmed to reproduce the lattice constants of these phases with the relative error of under ±1% in comparion with experiments, being clearly better than the PBE functional which overall overestimated the lattice constants in accordance with the general tendency of GGA for XC interaction. In the following calculations, therefore, we could use the PBEsol functional with a confidence of accuracy.

We then investigated the relative stabilities of the TiO2 polymorphs by comparing their calculated DFT total energies per formula unit after structural optimizations for anatase, rutile, ramsdellite, hollandite, and TB-I, -II, -III and -IV phases. Fig. 3 shows a schematic view of the total energy differences of TiO2 phases in reference to the anatase phase, together with the previous DFT results obtained by using the PBE and the hybrid HSE06 functionals.40 In these DFT calculations, the anatase phase was confirmed to have the lowest total energy. One can perceive that the overall tendency of the phases' stabilities changes severely depending on the choice of the XC functional. In the previous PBE and HSE06 calculations, TB phases were found to be energetically more stable than the precedent phases of rutile, ramsdellite and hollandite (the TB-III and -IV phases were ∼6 meV higher per formula unit than the rutile phase). In our PBEsol calculation, however, the TB-I, -II, and -III phases were found to be energetically higher than the anatase, rutile and hollandite phases but lower than the ramsdellite phase, while the TB-IV phase was found to have the highest total energy among the phases. In addition, the TB-I and -II phases had almost the same total energies commonly with the three different XC functionals, indicating a close similarity of their structures. We also calculated their formation energies with reference to pure Ti bulk and O2 gas, of which the relative differences are exactly the same as the total energy differences. From our calculation results showing that some TB phases are more stable than the experimentally found ramsdellite phase in accordance with the previous work where the TB phases were also found to be even more favourable than the rutile phase,40 one can expect that the TB phases can be synthesized experimentally. It should be noted that the rational phase stability diagram as a function of temperature and pressure can be determined by estimating the Gibbs free energy with the first-principles atomistic thermodynamics method.

3.2 Energetics and structural properties
In order to estimate the cycling stability of electrode materials during insertion/extraction of Na ions, we investigated the crystalline structures of Na-inserted TiO2 compounds NaxTiO2 in TB phases, and calculated the formation energies of these compounds and the binding energies of Na ions. As mentioned above, our supercells for the TB phases include 8 formula units and thus the number of inserted Na ions could be from 0 to 8, allowing the Na content x = 0.0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75, 0.875, and 1.0 in NaxTiO2. In Table 2, we show the calculated lattice constants (a, b, and c), relative volume expansion rate rvol = (Vx − V0)/V0 × 100% by increasing the Na content x in NaxTiO2 compounds in the TB-I and -II phases, and binding energies of Na atoms (for the TB-III and -IV phases, see Table S1, ESI†).

The strength of the interaction between the Na atom and the host compound TiO2 can be assessed by the binding energy per Na atom (Eb), which can be defined as follows,27,50 (1)where ENaxTiO2 and ETiO2 are the total energies per formula unit of NaxTiO2 and TiO2 compounds, respectively, and ENagas is the total energy of Na in the gas phase (i.e., isolated Na atom). The sodium binding energies were calculated to be negative in the four different TB phases, giving an implication of an exothermic process for Na insertion, and they decrease in magnitude on increasing the Na content x overall (see Fig. S3, ESI†). Looking at the TB-I case carefully, Eb gradually decreases in magnitude from −2.20 eV (x = 0.125) to −1.84 eV (x = 0.5) but changes a little only from −1.79 eV (x = 0.625) to −1.73 eV (x = 1.0) when more than 4Na atoms are inserted into the supercell. As expected from the above analysis of BVS in Fig. 2(b), the Na atoms were confirmed to reside at one of the two identical sites inside the 6-membered ring by structural optimizations of NaxTiO2 supercells. Here, the Na atoms might be supposed to place uniformly over the rings first, so that each Na atom can occupy the whole channel space when x ≤ 0.5, resulting in the growing repulsion between the inter-channel Na atoms and thus decreasing the binding energy in magnitude. When Na atoms are further inserted into the Na0.5TiO2 compound, they could occupy another remaining site inside the ring, and could be forced to move towards the 1D channel wall owing to the repulsion between the intra-channel Na atoms, leading to a strengthening of Na–O attraction and very small change of Eb when x > 0.5. We note that the similar trend and analysis can also be valid for TB-III and -IV phases, where the binding energies were found to change within −2.21 to −1.89 eV (−1.70 to −1.58 eV) and −2.10 to −1.86 eV (−1.76 to −1.66 eV) in the range of 0.125 < x < 0.5 (0.625 < x < 1.0), respectively. In TB-II, however, Eb decreases in magnitude from −2.29 to −1.93 eV when x ≤ 0.5 and from −1.76 to −1.48 eV when x > 0.5, which might be a larger change compared with the former cases.
During the charge/discharge process, electrodes in general experience a multi-step phase transition, induced by inserting the guest ions, and the relative phase stability of the intermediate compound with a certain ratio x of the inserted ion can be estimated by the formation energy. The formation energy of Na-inserted TiO2 compound, NaxTiO2, from the two end compounds, i.e., pristine TiO2 and fully sodiated NaTiO2, can be calculated using their corresponding total energies as follows, Ef = ENaxTiO2 − [xENaTiO2 + (1 − x)ETiO2](2)The calculated formation energies of NaxTiO2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) compounds in the four different TB phases are shown in Fig. 4, together with the convex hull lines. For all the intermediate compounds NaxTiO2 in these TB phases, the formation energies were determined to be negative, indicating their certain formation rather than the formation of a solid solution from the two end compounds. The following observations were obtained; (1) the lowest energy compounds are found at x = 0.25 in TB-I and -III phases while at x = 0.5 in II and IV phases, (2) the magnitudes of the lowest energies are in the order of IV (−1.28 eV) > III (−1.26) > II (−0.23) > I phase (−0.10), (3) the intermediate phases lying on the convex hull lines are found at x = 0.125, 0.25, and 0.375 in the TB-I phase, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 in the II phase, 0.125, 0.25, and 0.375 in the III phase and 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 in the IV phase. These intermediate phases can be commonly characterized to preserve their original crystalline lattices of the pristine TiO2 TB phases as orthorhombic systems, i.e., the lattice angles as α = β = γ = 90°, but with different lattice constants and slightly distorted TiO5 trigonal bipyramids and their interconnections of forming the 6- or 8-membered rings, and will be used to evaluate the electode step potential as discussed below. It should be noted that although other intermediate phases with different Bravais lattice could be generated also during the insertion process, they drifted away from the convex hull lines. This indicated that severe phase transformations in these compounds might not occur during the charge/discharge process, giving a hint of good cycling stability if they are utilized as electrode materials.

The optimized supercells corresponding to the points lying on the convex hull line are shown together. 
In order to get more detailed insight into the cycling stability, we considered the change tendency of lattice constants and the relative volume expansion rate (rvol) by increasing the Na content x. The change tendencies of lattice constants and volume were observed to be quite different according to the phases. In the TB-I phase, the lattice constant a gradually decreases from 11.96 to 10.76 Å by increasing x, while b and c increase from 3.77 and 8.89 Å to 3.96 and 9.74 Å, respectively, resulting in the gradual increase of rvol from 0.58 to 3.48% (see Table 1 and Table S1, ESI†). A similar tendency was observed in the TB-IV phase, where rvol increases from 0.48 to 3.73% by increasing x with the lowest value of 0.33% at x = 0.5. For the case of the TB-II phase, the lattice constants a and c decrease in general while b increases on increasing x, leading to the volume shrinking to −7.82% at x = 0.25 and again expands to −0.89% at x = 1.0 but is still smaller compared with that at x = 0.0. Similar wavy changes of lattice constants were also found in TB-III, where a and c decrease first and then increase, resulting in the decrease of rvol to −4.16% at x = 0.25 and then the increase to 9.10% at x = 1.0, on increasing x. With respect to the battery performance, therefore, the TB-I and -IV phases are favorable due to relatively lower volume expansion rate than the II and III phases. It should be again emphasized that in these TB phases the relative volume change is under 10%, and moreover, there is no change of crystalline system, indicating their higher cycling stabilities during the charge/discharge process.
3.3 Electrochemical properties
We then estimated the electrochemical performance of NaxTiO2 compounds in the TB phases by calculating the electrode potential and the activation energy for sodium ion migration. To compute the step intercalation electrode potential vs. Na/Na+ within the DFT framework, we considered the following cell reaction,(xj − xi)Na+ + (xj − xi)e− + NaxiTiO2 → NaxjTiO2where, xj and xi are the adjacent Na contents, which can be identified in the convex hull plot of formation energy, and e is the elementary charge. Then, the step discharge voltage can be calculated by taking the total energy difference between the adjacent Na-inserted TiO2 compounds, using the following equation,51 (3)where E is the DFT total energy of the corresponding compound.
The step average redox potential vs. Na/Na+ can be calculated using the intermediate structures lying on the convex hull line27,38 as shown in Fig. 5. The previously calculated electrode voltages of TB compounds as LIB anodes40 are also shown for comparison, demonstrating that the average voltages for SIB are clearly lower than their LIB counterparts as in many other electrode materials due to lower redox potential of Na than Li.52 As discussed above, the different Na insertion sites from the Li sites may also affect the electrode voltage, lowering it possibly due to less closely packed Na atoms with O atoms. In the first step of the voltage profile, the redox potentials were computed to be 1.03, 1.17, and 0.94 V between x = 0 and x = 0.125 in the TB-I, -III, and -IV phases, and 1.04 V between x = 0 and x = 0.25 in TB-II, respectively. When compared with other Ti–O systems, these values of voltage are higher than 0.7–0.8 V in Na2+xTi6O13.39 Increasing the Na content lowers the electrode voltage, and the final step voltages were calculated to be 0.41, 0.09, and 0.17 V from x = 0.375, 0.5, and 0.75 to x = 1.0 in the TB-I, -III, and -IV phases, respectively. In the case of the TB-II phase, the voltage becomes negative from x = 0.5, implying that Na ions are energetically unfavorable to intercalate into the partially sodiated Na0.5TiO2 compound. These results indicate that the TB-I, -III, and -IV phases can support the fully sodiated compounds, reaching the highest specific capacity of 335 mA h g−1, whereas the TB-II phase cannot be fully sodiated by the electrochemical process, thus exhibiting lower specific capacity. It should be noted that the redox potential of TB-III is too close to 0 V (∼0.09 V for half capacity x = 0.5–1) versus Na/Na+, indicating that it is prone to suffer from capacity fading because even a small amount of polarization would lead to kinetic limitations on electrochemical insertion of Na ions. Therefore, regarding the electrode voltage, it is revealed that TB-I and -IV phases are favorable to the SIB anode application, whereas the TB-II phase has a low specific capacity and exhibits a safety issue of dendrite growth, and the TB-III phase may suffer from capacity fading.

In order to assess the rate capability of TB compounds, which is one of the important factors for evaluating the suitability of electrode materials, we calculated the activation energies for Na ion migrations by using the NEB method. Here, we considered two different limit conditions of Na concentration, i.e., Na-poor (x = 0.125) and Na-rich (x = 0.875) conditions. Fig. 6 shows the energy profile for Na ion migrations along the zigzag path through the 1D channel identified by the BVS analysis, and Table 3 lists the corresponding activation barriers. At the Na-poor condition, the activation barriers in the TB-I, -II, and -III phases were estimated to be 0.17, 0.19, and 0.23 eV with migration distances of 2.8, 2.3, and 2.8 Å, respectively, being much lower than ∼0.4 eV for Li ion migration in graphite as the standard LIB anode53 and for Na(digl)2 solvated ion migration in graphite.15 It was determined to be 0.58 eV with a migration distance of 4.1 Å in the case of the TB-IV phase. Considering that the pore sizes of the 1D channels are 5.77, 5.65, 6.16, and 6.71 Å in the TB-I, -II, -III, and -IV phases, respectively,40 it can be said that a larger pore size leads to a higher activation barrier. When increasing the Na content, the activation barriers became higher as 0.53, 0.26, 0.30, and 0.65 eV in these TB phases at the Na-rich condition (Table 3). In the case of the TB-II phase, the Na-intercalated compound can be formed only up to Na0.5TiO2, revealed by the electrode potential, and thus the activation barrier at x = 0.5 was also calculated to be 0.46 eV, indicating a lowering of ionic mobility (see Table S2, ESI†). Although the TB-III phase has low activation energy barriers in both Na-poor and -rich conditions, it is less promising owing to it being prone to suffer from capacity fading as discussed above. Meanwhile, the TB-I phase retains its superior rate capability up to x = 0.5; the activation barriers were found to be 0.23, 0.21 and 0.34 eV at x = 0.25, 0.375 and 0.5, respectively, being comparable with that for Na diffusion in layered dichalcogenides like MoS2 (0.28 eV).27 Therefore, the TB-I phase can be said to be the best choice for SIB anode applications with respect to the reaction kinetics and volume change and electrode potential. Even though the TB-IV phase may not be much suitable for fast charge/discharge kinetics, it is still worth considering as an SIB anode material with its moderate ionic mobility.

3.4 Electronic structures
Finally, we calculated the electronic structures of the Na-intercalated TiO2 compounds in TB phases to get an insightful understanding of electron transfer and chemical bonds. From the viewpoint of battery operation, the electrode materials should be both electron and ion conductors, because the electrons traveling through the external circuit merge with the Na+ ions in the electrode passing through it. Based on the above consequence that the TB-I phase has the most superior electrochemical properties among the four TB phases, we only considered the TB-I phase in this subsection by calculating the projected density of states (PDOS) and electronic charge density differences.

Fig. 7 displays the calculated PDOS of NaxTiO2 compounds in the TB-I phase at different values of Na content x. It was found that the pristine TiO2 is a semiconductor with a wide bandgap of ∼3.0 eV, which is similar to the experimental value of the rutile phase and smaller than that of the previous PBE calculation (3.88 eV).40 As in other transition metal oxides, its valence band maximum (VBM) is predominantly composed of O 2p states, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is composed of Ti 3d states. Upon sodiation of TiO2 forming NaxTiO2 compounds, such features of VBM and CBM were not severely altered, and moreover, Na states were not found in these frontier bands, implying that Na atoms are fully ionized by donating their valence electrons to the host. By increasing the Na content, the energy gap between the VBM and CBM decreases, and part of the CBM became occupied states, demonstrating that the sodiation changes the compound from an electron insulating to electron conducting material. Since the original CBM is from the Ti 3d states, it can be said that the electrons from the inserted Na atoms are transferred to the Ti atoms upon sodiation.
 Fig. 7  Projected density of states of NaxTiO2 compounds in the TB-I phase at different values of Na content x, calculated with the PBEsol XC functional. 
The electron transfer upon sodiation of TiO2 can be shown more intuitively by plotting the electronic charge density difference, defined as Δn = nNaxTiO2 − (nTiO2 + xnNa)(4)where n is the corresponding electronic density. The electronic charge density difference in Na0.125TiO2 in the TB-I phase is shown in Fig. 8. It was observed that remarkable redistribution of electronic charge density occurs around mainly the Na atom and nearby Ti and O atoms. Through the electronic charge density difference integrated over the b-axis, as shown in Fig. 8(b), it can be seen that there are charge depletion regions around the Na atom, and charge accumulation regions around the O atoms, while around the Ti atoms both the charge accumulation and depletion regions exist. It can be thought that at the first step of TiO2 formation the Ti atoms give their 3d electrons to the O atoms, becoming Ti4+ and O2− ions, and at the second step of Na insertion the electron transfer occurs from the Na atom to the Ti4+ ion, becoming Na+ and Ti3+ ions. This confirms that, as expected, Ti atoms act as a redox couple of Ti3+/Ti4+ upon insertion/extraction of a Na atom. Similar arguments can be found in the TB-II, -III, and -IV phases (Fig. S4, ESI†). Such remarkable electron transfer upon sodiation indicates the strong ionic bonding between ions and thus stable formation of NaxTiO2 compounds in the TB phases.

4 Conclusions
In this work we provide an insightful understanding of electrochemical properties of sodiated TiO2 compounds in penta-oxygen-coordinated trigonal bipyramid phases, aiming at finding the potentiality of an effective anode material of sodium-ion batteries. Identifying the four different crystalline structures as TB-I, -II, -III, and -IV phases, these structures were found to have comparable relative stabilities with the precedent TiO2 phases by comparing the DFT total energies calculated with the PBEsol XC functional. Various supercells were constructed to make models of sodiated NaxTiO2 compounds in these TB phases, including 8 TiO2 formula units and up to 8 Na atoms, with the Na content from x = 0 to x = 1 with an interval of 0.125, and their crystalline structures and energetics were investigated by using the PBEsol calculations. The calculated sodium binding energies indicate the strong binding between Na and the host, and the exothermic reaction of Na insertion into TiO2 in the TB phases. Upon sodiation, TB-I and -IV phases were found to be expanded with the relative volume expansion rate of under 4%, while TB-II and -III phases were found to be shrunk and expanded within the range of ±10%, respectively. We also identified the intermediate structures lying on the convex hull lines by calculating the formation energies, and estimated the electrode voltage by using these structures, revealing that TB-I, -III, and -IV phases exhibit low first step voltages of around 1.0 V with a specific capacity of ∼335 mA h g−1 but the TB-II phase cannot be fully sodiated due to negative voltage from x = 0.5. Activation barriers for Na ion migrations were determined, indicating that the TB-I phase has the lowest activation barrier of under 0.35 eV at the Na content from x = 0.125 to x = 0.5. Through the analysis of PDOS and charge density difference upon sodiation, moreover, the TB-I phase changes from electron insulating to electron conducting due to the electron transfer from Na atoms to Ti ions. Based on these findings, NaxTiO2 compounds in the TB-I phase can be concluded to be the best choice for a SIB anode material with reasonably low electrode voltage, high specific capacity and superior rate capability. We want to emphasize that the high specific capacity of ∼335 mA h g−1 in particular is possible only by taking advantage of the microporous and, at the same time, stable structural framework of unprecedented TB phases, which has never been achieved with other titania phases or any other materials based on the rocking-chair mechanism.
