    , Accepted 7th January 2022First published on 7th January 2022AbstractA series of acceptor–donor–acceptor type fused-ring non-fullerene acceptors, FOR-IN, FOR-1F and FOR-2F, were designed and synthesized, featuring the same pyran-composed backbone and different fluorine-substituted 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone terminals. The increased fluorine substitution in FOR-2F enhances its light harvesting capacity and electron mobility significantly, compared with the molecules FOR-IN and FOR-1F. With FOR-2F as the acceptor and the matching polymeric PM6 as the donor, their organic solar cells demonstrate a high performance of up to 15.18% power conversion efficiency. This is the highest performance reported to date for all pyran fused NFAs. In addition, the fluorine number- and location-induced variations of electronic property, charge transport, film morphology and photovoltaic property were investigated systematically.
Introduction
In the last few years, organic solar cells (OSCs) have gone through a rapid surge in development due to both the optimization of the active molecular structure and active layer morphology. Note that this is above their intrinsic merits of solution-processing, light weight, semi-transparency, flexibility and large-scale roll-to-roll production.1–17 A typical OSC device usually employs an electron donor and acceptor blend as the light active layer, which plays a dominant role in the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.18–31 Recently reported high-performance acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) usually possess strong absorption in the near-infrared region and favorable molecular stacking, thereby generating a systematically enhanced photocurrent and voltage output.32–40 However, so far, OSCs surpassing 18% power conversion efficiency (PCE) have been almost entirely based on Y6 and its analogues.41–44 Besides the relatively ossified structures of the Y6 system, it is highly possible that lots of other distinctive A–D–A skeleton-based NFAs could achieve high-efficiency OSCs.31,34,45 Therefore, it is very necessary to explore other types of NFAs with the aim of achieving state-of-the-art OSCs and beyond.
Pyran fused rings have been explored as distinctive blocks to construct a class of highly efficient NFAs.11,37,46–58 Recently, our group developed an encouraging NFA, FO-2F,45 featuring an easily synthesized pyran fused ring as the main building kernel. Note that FO-2F-based OSCs have afforded excellent PCEs, rendering them one of the most promising candidates for economically feasible OSC molecules. However, further improvement of their overall performance via structural modification still presents a great challenge. Based on our previous work, introducing alkyl chains at the β site of terminal thiophene has been proven as a feasible strategy to enlarge the VOC59 and enhance the device stability simultaneously by depressing the photo-decomposition of the NFAs.60 In addition, halogen substitution usually acts as an effective way to tune their molecular energy levels and stacking models.30,38,61–70 Specifically, fluorination on the end group of 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN)71 can simultaneously down-shift the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of NFAs without causing large steric hindrance.72,73 Meanwhile, this could also improve the crystallinity and charge transport property of NFAs. Bearing these in mind, we designed three new acceptor molecules (Fig. 1) based on previously reported FO-2F by grafting an octyl group on terminal thiophene of the central donor part, which is expected to improve the voltage and stability of OSCs.59,74

Furthermore, different fluorine-substituted electron-withdrawing INCN units were end-capped with the central donor part above to afford three new NFAs (Fig. 1). These three NFAs possess stepwise lower LUMO energy levels from FOR-IN to FOR-2F, resulting in the strongest light absorption in the NIR region for FOR-2F. As a result, OSCs using FOR-2F and the well-known polymeric donor PM6 as the active layer achieved an excellent PCE of 15.18%, qualifying for the best performance reported to date for all pyran fused NFAs.
Synthesis and thermal properties
The synthetic routes for FOR-IN, FOR-1F and FOR-2F are shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The detailed procedures and characterization are summarized in the ESI.† The chemical structures of FOR-IN, FOR-1F and FOR-2F were fully characterized and confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) and 1H/13C NMR. All the three molecules exhibit good solubility in commonly used solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform and chlorobenzene, in favour of the following solution-processing during the fabrication of OSCs. From the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves in Fig. S2 (ESI†), all the three molecules were found to demonstrate great thermal stability, with FOR-2F having a slightly higher decomposition temperature (Td) of 285 °C, compared with 280 °C for FOR-IN and 281 °C for FOR-1F.
Optical absorption and electrochemical properties
In order to evaluate the light harvesting ability of the three NFAs, we measured their ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra in chloroform solutions and thin films (Fig. 2a and b), and the absorption spectra of the PM6:FOR-IN, PM6:FOR-1F and PM6:FOR-2F blend films are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). As expected, FOR-2F and FOR-1F exhibit a clear red-shifted absorption in chloroform solutions compared with that of FOR-IN, which should be ascribed to the fluorine-induced decrease of energy gaps. The maximum absorption peaks (λmax) of FOR-IN, FOR-1F and FOR-2F bathochromically shift by 27, 36 and 52 nm from solution to solid states, respectively, suggesting the formation of stronger aggregates. More interestingly, the λmax of the FOR-2F film exhibits further 21 nm red-shifting from 742 to 763 nm after thermal annealing, further driving its absorption onset (λonset) towards 810 nm. The further red-shifted light absorption can be expected to output a larger short-circuit current (JSC) in OSCs. We further carried out cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests to investigate the experimental energy levels of FOR-IN, FOR-1F and FOR-2F (Fig. 2c). Based on the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, the HOMOs can be estimated as −5.70 eV for FOR-IN, −5.73 eV for FOR-1F and −5.76 eV for FOR-2F. Additionally, the LUMOs are calculated to be −3.67 eV for FOR-IN, −3.73 eV for FOR-1F and −3.76 eV for FOR-2F, thus resulting in stepwise decreased optical band gaps of FOR-IN, FOR-1F and FOR-2F, being 1.64 eV, 1.59 eV and 1.55 eV, respectively. The down-shifted HOMOs and LUMOs should be assigned to the substitution of fluorine atoms due to their large electronegativity.

Generally, the suitable alignment of energy levels and favourable decrease of energy gaps may result in an efficient OSC (Table 1).

Photovoltaic properties
To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of FOR-IN, FOR-1F and FOR-2F, we fabricated OSCs with an inverted structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/PFN-Br/active layer/MoOx/Ag (Fig. 2d). Herein, PM6 was selected as the polymeric donor due to its matched energy levels and complementary absorption with the obtained NFAs. The optimal weight ratio (m%) of donors and NFAs was determined to be 1:1 and the detailed device parameters with various conditions are summarized in Tables S1–S10 in the ESI.† The corresponding optimal J–V characteristics are displayed in Fig. 3a and the best photovoltaic data of FOR-IN, FOR-1F and FOR-2F are summarized in Table 2. From FOR-IN to FOR-2F, stepwise decreased VOC can be observed, being 1.071, 1.020 and 0.969 V, respectively, demonstrating their LUMO energy level dependence. It is worth noting that JSC improves significantly from FOR-IN to FOR-2F, being 15.38, 18.65, and 21.25 mA cm−2, respectively. The enhanced JSC should be attributed to the obvious red-shifted absorption and more efficient charge separation and transport from FOR-IN to FOR-2F, as discussed below. Finally, with gradually improved fill factors, the OSCs employing FOR-2F as NFAs yield an impressive PCE of 15.18%, much better than that of the FOR-IN- and FOR-1F-based devices. Moreover, energy losses (Eloss) of the OSCs were calculated using the formula Eloss = Eg − eVOC, giving rise to relatively small energy losses in the range of 0.56–0.57 eV. The observed result of enhanced performance of the OSCs due to the increasing fluorination of the end groups is consistent with the widely reported literatures.63,65 External quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the optimized devices are recorded in Fig. 3b, indicating an efficient photo-electron response of up to ∼810 nm for the FOR-2F-based OSCs. The clearly broadened photo-electron response and larger EQEs of FOR-2F with respect to the other two NFAs should be respectively ascribed to its red-shifted absorption and improved charge separation, as discussed below. Note that the integrated JSC values for EQEs are in good agreement with the JSC obtained from the J–V curves for the devices of all the three molecules.

In order to reveal the origin of EQE variation, we investigated the charge generation and charge recombination behaviour in the PM6:FOR-IN-, FOR-1F- and PM6:FOR-2F-based optimal devices. The photocurrent (Jph) versus effective applied voltage (Veff) curves were recorded and are presented in Fig. 3c. The charge dissociation probabilities can be calculated from Jph/Jsat at the short-circuit condition, and are 87%, 90% and 93% for the FOR-IN- to FOR-2F-based devices, respectively. The enlarged charge dissociation probabilities suggest improved exciton dissociation efficiency for the FOR-2F-based OSC, in good accordance with the EQE spectra. Furthermore, we measured the light-intensity (P) dependence of JSC to study the charge recombination properties (Fig. 3d). Based on the power-law equation JSC ∝ Pα, the α values for the different OSCs of FOR-IN, FOR-1F and FOR-2F are 0.911, 0.922 and 0.949, respectively. The close to unit α value indicates very few bimolecular recombinations in the devices, partially accounting for the high FF values of the OSCs.
The charge mobilities of the blend films of PM6:FOR-IN, PM6:FOR-1F and PM6:FOR-2F were estimated through the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S5, ESI†). The PM6:FOR-2F photoactive layers exhibit a hole/electron mobility of 1.54 × 10−4/1.30 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than those of the FOR-IN (6.71 × 10−5/5.55 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1) and FOR-1F (8.99 × 10−5/7.12 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1) blend films. The higher hole and electron mobilities of PM6:FOR-2F should account for the increased FF of the resulting OSCs. Note that the charge mobilities increased with increased fluorination of the end groups, which could be attributed to the fluorine-induced strong molecular interactions.
Morphology characterization
As we all know, the morphologies of the active layers have a great influence on device performance; hence, we carried out transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) to obtain morphology images of the active layers at the nanoscale, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†) and Fig. 4a–c.

In the TEM images, all the three blend films demonstrate finely dispersed phase separation with PM6. Furthermore, in the AFM images, PM6:FOR-2F has a slightly smaller root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 2.12 nm compared to 2.34 nm for PM6:FOR-IN and 2.28 nm for PM6:FOR-1F. Moreover, the line cuts of grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) patterns are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The FOR-2F neat film shows strong π–π stacking diffraction peaks in both OOP and IP, suggesting a more ordered molecular packing compared with those of FOR-IN and FOR-1F. When blended with the PM6 donor (Fig. 4d–f), all the three blend films demonstrate a clear face-on orientation, indicated by the strong diffraction peaks at ∼1.73 Å−1 in the OOP direction. The π–π distance of the three blend films can be estimated as ∼3.65 Å, suggesting strong intermolecular action. As shown in Table S12 (ESI†), the crystal coherence lengths (CCL) in the (010) region for the FOR-IN-, FOR-1F- and FOR-2F-based blend films were calculated based on the Scherrer equation (), being 29.34, 33.31 and 41.23 Å, respectively. The intense π–π stacking and larger CCL of FOR-2F would facilitate its charge transport in the blend film, which is consistent with its higher electron mobility and improved photovoltaic performance compared to those of the other two NFAs.
Conclusion
Three new NFAs were designed and synthesized by capping fluorine-substituted end groups (INIC) with a pyran fused central donor. Among the three NFAs, the two fluorine substitution in FOR-2F drives the absorption of NFAs towards the near-infrared region and improves electron mobility greatly; hence, its OSC device demonstrates a highly enhanced JSC of 21.25 mA cm−2, FF of ∼74%, and VOC of 969 mV, affording an excellent PCE of 15.18%. This renders it as the highest value reported to date in pyran fused NFAs. These results demonstrate that other A–D–A type molecular systems, through symmetric optimization, could also offer desirable organic photovoltaic molecules, providing another potentially new molecular system to further improve organic photovoltaic performance.
