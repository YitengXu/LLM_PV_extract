1. Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have captured much attention and imagination of scientists, researchers and industry around the globe for their variety of important physical and chemical properties towards the development of civilization by ritualistic continuous improvement in materials technology. They are basically crystalline solids with atomically thin layers.1,2 Layered combinations of different 2D materials are commonly called van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures.3,4 The layered material can consist of only one element (-ene suffix in their names, e.g., graphene, borophene), or more than one in the form of a chemical compound (-ane or -ide suffixes in their names, e.g., graphane, borocarbonitrides).5,6 Elemental carbon, silicon, boron, germanium, tin, lead, and phosphorus are found to have 2D allotropes. Furthermore, graphane, hexagonal boron nitride, borocarbonitrides, germanane, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and MXenes are notably known as layered chemical compounds.7
The properties of layered materials are largely different from their 3D bulk complements.8,9 There are three distinct reasons behind this difference. Primarily, although it may seem that for weak vdW interactions, 2D layered materials are weaker than 3D bulk materials, the covalent bonding within the individual 2D layer is found to be much stronger. For instance, graphene has a high tensile strength, i.e., 1000 times larger compared to graphite, and whereas a graphite pencil can easily be broken, graphene is over 100 times stronger than ordinary steel. Secondly, by virtue of having more surface area, 2D layered materials are chemically more reactive and sensitive than their 3D bulk counterparts.10,11 Finally, electrons are confined within a plane for 2D materials, leading to charge redistribution, which causes modification of the band structure when compared with bulk.12 For illustration, the controlled band structure is the cause for the fluorescence of the monolayer MoS2 and extremely high conductivity of graphene. Another notable effect of dimensional confinement is the trim down of the dielectric screening between electrons and holes for semiconductors.13 This, in turn, yields enhanced Coulomb interaction, leading to stronger and more stable excitons by quantum confinement to modify the wavelength of emitted/absorbed light compared to bulk 3D materials. In a nutshell, layered materials possess useful and unique properties (e.g., charge density wave occurrence,14,15 anisotropic magnetic behaviour and conductivity,16,17 and anisotropy of photoluminescence18), which are not available in their bulk counterparts. This is why they are widely employed for applications,19 such as photovoltaics,20 semiconductors,21 electrodes,22 and water purification.23
Conceptually, these materials should have chemical bonding, whose nature is intermediate between ionic and covalent. In other words, there is less atomic density and more difference between the electronegativities of the constituent ions, and there is better attainment of incipient or even finite ionic conductivities at moderate temperatures. The resulting likelihood of structural phase transitions and captivating new thermochemistry would pave the way for the development of better 2D materials with more specialized applications. Controlling the band gap of semiconductors in general allows for the creation of desirable electronic properties.24 Bandgap engineering is the process of altering or controlling the bandgap of a material. This is classically done by either adjusting the alloy composition or configuring the layered materials with alternating compositions.25 As a matter of fact, with greater flexibility in tuning the band gap for layered materials, its acceptability is better in the industry for robust applications. To illustrate the above statement, let us consider TMDs, which represent a strikingly imperative series of 2D crystals. Their optical and electronic properties could be tuned by either changing the components or playing with the thickness.26,27 For instance, the bandgap of MoS2 (the most researched TMD) can be distended from 1.29 to 1.9 eV via dropping the thickness from multilayers to a monolayer.26,28 However, they cannot be utilized for devices indispensably needing a bandgap value beyond this range.29 An effective and reasonable solution to this problem is to replace MoS2 (TMD) with metal phosphorus trichalcogenides (MTP)30 or metal chalcogen phosphates (MPX3).31 Unlike TMDs, M for MPX3 herein essentially represents either a transition metal or a group II partial alkaline metal, P stands for phosphorus, and X denotes either S or Se. 2D MPX3 phases are very likely to resemble most of the specific properties of 2D TMDs with a wider band gap of 1.2–3.5 eV.32,33 In essence, this wider bandgap is particularly crucial for allowing devices that operate at widely higher temperatures (order of 300 °C), enabling their usage at a higher voltage and current scenario. This, in turn, makes them highly attractive for strategic applications. In addition to that, the wider band gaps of MPX3 is responsible for the enhanced light absorption efficiency compared to the TMD materials.34
Since its synthesis/discovery by Friedel35 and Ferrand36 as FePS3 more than a century ago, a plethora of interestingly important properties has been unfolded by scientists. However, the most significant research volume encompasses the thirty years of the last century. Very recently, there has been a re-emergence in research interest for such kinds of materials in view of the exploration of specialized potential applications. The research categories span a vast extent of modern materials study, ranging from materials discovery, fundamental magnetic37–39 and ferroelectric40–42 properties, to applications such as Li-ion batteries,43,44 photo-electrochemical reactions,45 and hydrogen (H2) storage.46,47 It is pertinent to note that from an application point of view, each of the distinct properties of MPX3 materials is closely interlinked. For example, the electronic structure determines the magnetic response and Curie temperature, which is an attribute regarding magnetism, and is vital for the modality of ferroelectricity. Although there exists a few classic reviews papers30,31,48–50 for acquiring an appreciable makeshift concept about the family of MPX3 materials, and their structure, properties, synthesis and applications, the instances of reviewing many of their vital features (such as multiple Dirac cone, vibrational properties and response in the presence of strain) are not known to the best knowledge of the authors. This review addresses many of such scarcely touched aspects of MPX3 materials, considering appreciable volume of research in order to impart a more complete discussion for exploring their structure, properties, synthesis routes and applications.
2. Structure of MPX3-based materials
2.1. Crystal structure and composition
All MPX3 compounds share an essential common organizational signature such that the (P2S6)4− or (P2Se6)4− anion sublattice remains within each layered crystal. The honeycomb configuration of the transition/other metal ions is disseminated around the (P2X6)4− bipyramids (Fig. 1a and b), where the blue, purple and orange spheres represent the positions of metal, phosphorous and chalcogen atoms, respectively.48 Hence, these compounds are usually designated as M2P2X6. For possessing a wider vdW gap (i.e., shortest distance between the chalcogen layers) compared to TMD (Fig. 1c), where the black and yellow spheres represent the positions of the metal and chalcogen atoms, respectively,51 diverse atomic radii cations can be positioned in the MPX3, along with the alteration of the slab size. The layers of the nearly closed packed surfaces, consisting of chalcogen atoms, are formed simultaneously with the systematic array of octahedral coordinated sites. For a certain complex of the type M22+[P2X6]4−, 2/3rd of the octahedral centres is occupied by doubly charged metal (M2+) cations, and the remaining 1/3rd of the positions is filled by P–P dimers. Furthermore, these P–P dimers are found to be covalently bonded via chalcogen (X) atoms with each P atom, ensuring tetrahedral coordination with three of the chalcogen atoms and one of the phosphorus atom, configuring a (P2X6)4− unit that is analogous to ethane. Therefore, in the final composition of MPX3, each single P atom is coordinated by three X atoms and two M sites. Although the flat pyramid involving X2− ions remains invariable for the P2X64− structural modification, the P–P distance is slightly adjusted to accommodate distinct metal cations. A higher P–P distance indicates a greater layer thickness.30 In addition to the M22+[P2X6]4− type, there may be five additional possible sublattices, namely M4+[P2X6]4−, M4/3, 3+Y2/3[P2X6]4− (where Y symbolizes the vacant site), M21+M2+[P2X6]4−, and M1+M3+[P2X6]4− (with two variations in regard to the nature of cation ordering).31 Although the global structure within the individual lamella is basically the same across the MTP family, the composition varies in contrast to the symmetry and stacking arrangements. As shown in Fig. 1d,34 a rectilinear association between the lattice constant (a0) and bond length (bM–X) exists in the MPX3 family. With rise in M–X bond length, lattice constant rises linearly for both S and Se groups, and the gradients for MPS3 and MPSe3 are 1.51 and 1.55, respectively. With the Se atom being larger in size, MPSe3 exhibits a relatively greater lattice constant than MPS3.

Both anion and cation components can be tuned by altering the M and X atoms in MPX3. On the anion side, if the P2S64− and P2Se64− anions are alloyed, it forms a mixed chalcogen (e.g., Ni2P2S6−xSex,52 CuInP2S6−xSex,41 MnPSxSe3−x,53 and Sn2P2S6−xSex).54 On the cation side, MPX3 can house group I elements (e.g., K, Rb), group II elements (e.g., Mg, Ca), group IV elements (e.g., Sn and Pb), transition metals (e.g., Sc, Mn, Fe, Co, Pd, Ag, Cd), rare earth elements (e.g., Er and Tm) or a combination thereof. Although the valence state is always MII for group II and IV cations, the valence state may vary for transition metal cations, depending on the element (group) chosen (e.g., MI for Au and Ag; MII for Zn, Mn, Fe; MII/MIII for V and Cr; or MIII for Sc, Al, Bi). To date, the most considered materials are Mn, Fe, and Ni-based MPX3 compounds for their applications in electrochemistry and catalysis.32,45,55,56 From the constituent point of view, MPX3 institutes a potentially broad material class. Table 1 presents an archetypal compilation of different MPX3 materials based on their crystallographic attributes.57–64 Depending on the nature of the cation, MPX3 may be a monometallic or polymetallic compound.

2.2. Monometallic MPX3
If there is only one element occupying the cation site (blue sphere in Fig. 1a), that MTP compound is termed as monometallic. It is convenient to study the most common MPX3 (i.e., MPX3 with divalent cation) through structural comparison with MIVX2 (e.g., MoS2) layered compounds. Let us consider the MPS3 phases as layered MS2 crystals with one third of the M sites replaced by P–P pairs (P2), i.e., M2/3(P2)1/3S2. The sulphur atoms are thought to embrace the surfaces within the individual lamella. As stated before, the P–P dimers form covalent bonding with six sulphur atoms to develop an ethane-like (P2S6)4− unit, wherein each P atom is tetrahedrally associated with three of the S atoms. In the interim, a sulphur atom is coordinated with two MII sites and one P atom.
The widest symmetry of MIIPS3 is C2/m with a monoclinic crystal structure. An exception is HgPS3, which crystallizes into a space group of P,63 accompanied by distorted tetrahedrally coordinated Hg ions.34 SnP2S6 exhibits the MIV state with R3 symmetry.61
For MIIPSe3 (e.g., MgPSe3, CdPSe3, ZnPSe3, FePSe3), owing to the enflamed P–Se bond distance and Se–P–Se bond angles, their space group has been described as Rh.65 The distortions exhibited in the PSe3 groups on the bottom halves of one layer lead to the lack of an inversion centre for these MPSe3 crystals. In addition, NiPSe3 has the same symmetry as that of NiPS3 (C2/m). However, most selenides are identified as either monoclinic or trigonal crystallographic structures.
For the layered MIIPX3 crystals, their interlayer distances (d) range from 6.3 to 6.7 Å. The ordering of d, namely, dMnPS3 > dFePS3 > dNiPS3, is the same as that of the M radius (r) (rMn > rFe > rNi). Additionally, the selenides possess a larger d than that of the corresponding sulphides, like dMnPSe3 > dMnPS3.
2.3. Polymetallic MPX3
The “M” atoms in the MPX3 crystals could be replaced by other metal atoms, including homocharge and heterocharge substitution (blue sphere in Fig. 1a). If the size of the MII1 and MII2 cations is nearly the same, the homocharge substitution process will be understood with ease [e.g., Zn1−xFexPS3, Zn1−xNixPS3 (ref. 66) and CdxFe1−xP2S6 (ref. 49) (0 ≤ x ≤ 1)]. Again, one MII might also be replaced by a couple of heterocharge metal atoms, namely, 1/2MI and 1/2MIII. MI includes Ag+, Cu+, and MIII contains In3+, V3+, Sc3+, and Cr3+. The structure of the mixed-cation MIMIII[P2S6]4− compounds is much more diverse than monometallic compounds.
Most of the mixed sulphides are monoclinic, whereas many of the mixed selenides exhibit trigonal symmetry (Fig. 1e and f).67 In the monoclinic system, the crystal can be termed by vectors of dissimilar lengths, forming a rectangular prism with a parallelogram as its bottom. Thus, two vectors are orthogonal (meets at right angles to each other), whilst the third one encounters the remaining two at an angle different from 90°. The trigonal crystal system comprises 5 point groups (including single three-fold rotation axis), and 143 to 167 space groups. These 5 point groups have 7 (denoted by R) and 18 (denoted by P) corresponding space groups allocated to the rhombohedral and hexagonal lattice systems, respectively. For mixed sulphides, there are three broad stoichiometries: M1+M3+[P2S6]4− (e.g., trigonal and centrosymmetric AgInP2S668 and AgScP2S6, and non-centrosymmetric CuVP2S659), M21+M2+[P2S6]4− (e.g., Ag2MgP2S6 and Ag2MnP2S6 (ref. 69) having an inversion centre) and M4/33+Y2/3[P2S6]4−, wherein Y denotes a vacant site (e.g., Ga4/3P2S6 (ref. 70)). Mixed selenides are mostly available in two forms: M1+M3+[P2Se6]4− (e.g., CuAlP2Se6 (ref. 71) with random cation ordering) and M4/33+Y2/3[P2Se6]4−, where Y denotes a vacant site (e.g., In4/3P2Se6 (ref. 76)).
In summary, acquiring sufficient knowledge about the structure of MPX3 compounds is enormously vital for understanding the multiple functionalities of this particular material class. The highly tunable properties stem from the flexibility associated with the vdW structure. Depending on the number and valence of the cation (M), the MPX3 series may exhibit a wide range of compounds with distinct properties for discrete applications. Similarly, the choice of the chalcogen atom, whether S or Se, carries equal importance in predicting its structure–property correlations.
3. Properties of MPX3 based materials
The special crystal structure of the MPX3 compounds is responsible for specialized applications, such as water splitting, charge storage, and gas sensing.31 [P2X6]4− delivers a weak ligand field, leading to a high electron spin state of the metal atoms.77,78 This phenomenon inspired researchers to explore a plethora of unique magnetic responses demonstrated by this series of compounds both through experiment and computation. As stated earlier, the electronic configuration for these compounds differ, corresponding to the diverse cations and depending on the outer or d shell electron filling state. These features will be discussed in the following section.
3.1. Electronic structure
Most MTPs exhibit semi-conducting electronic characteristics having a wide range of bandgaps. A brief compilation of the bandgaps for different MPX3 compounds has been presented in Table 2.32–34,48,78–85 As stated earlier, it appears that there exists a sizable bandgap in all such materials in the order of 1.3–3.5 eV. The compounds with partially filled d-orbitals of cation are ordered magnetically, and seem to be Mott insulators. Apparently, the bonding character between the metal cation and P2S64− anion is mostly ionic. The size of the bandgap is highly sensitive to the metal cations present. For the same cation, the bandgaps are lesser in the selenides than in the sulphides due to the variation in the relative electronegativity. The s and p orbitals of the P atoms largely participate in the conduction-band edges, whereas the top of the valence band is significantly underwritten by the atomic orbitals of the chalcogen.31 Notably, considering the specific composition and magnetic configuration, the edges of the valence band and conduction band are dominated by metal, phosphorus, or chalcogen atoms. The crystal field splitting of the d-orbitals and the filling fractions affect their electronic structures near the Fermi level.48

The band structure and electronic densities of states (DOS) for the lowest energy magnetic state for MPS3 and MPSe3 have been calculated by Sen et al.85 (Fig. 2). Using only PBE-GGA (U = 0), both compounds turned out to be semiconductors with a bandgap of 1.35 eV and 1.02 eV, respectively. Bandgaps measured from optical absorption spectroscopy for the same compounds are 2.7 eV and 2.4 eV, respectively.86 The calculated values are lower than the experimental value because DFT tends to underestimate the bandgap due to its limitations. The calculated values are consistent with the DFT underestimation of bandgaps. Bandgaps with U = 3 eV turn out to be 1.47 eV and 1.19 eV for the sulphide and the selenide, respectively. The effects of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) on the band structure and bandgap of the material are very crucial. Band structures calculated with spin–orbit coupling are also shown in Fig. 2a and b (right sub-panels for each compound). For the band structure calculation of ferromagnetic materials having appreciable magnetocrystalline anisotropy, it is vital to consider the orbital motion of the electrons, which couples with the crystal electric field using the ‘magnetic force theorem’ as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).87 In MnPS3 and MnPSe3, in the absence of SOC, the electronic states are symmetric in nature for the two spin channels, as can be seen in the DOS (Fig. 2c and d). This is also obviously seen in the band structure. Splitting in the bands due to SOC is very minute, and clearly invisible in MnPS3, but is appreciable in MnPSe3. This is consistent with the fact that a larger magnetic anisotropy88 energy is associated with MnPSe3. SOC causes small changes in the position of the band edges. Consequently, the bandgaps change slightly, decreasing relative to the case without SOC. In MnPS3 and MnPSe3, the bandgap decreases by 17 meV and 41 meV, respectively.86

Magnetism has a huge influence on the band structure. Although Zhukov et al.89 were able to model the band structures of Fe2P2S6, Ni2P2S6, and Mn2P2S6 utilizing a linear muffin tin orbital basis method with an atomic sphere approximation (LMTO-ASA), their calculations including the spin polarization yielded lower energies, resulting an incorrect prediction of magnetic structures. Kurita and Nakao90,91 used an ab initio linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) approximation to correctly calculate the band diagrams for the above compounds. They were able to predict the general magnetic structure with reference to the nearest-neighbour (anti)ferromagnetic interactions for Mn2P2S6 and Ni2P2S6. So, we can see that the computed band gap is very much method-dependent, and sophisticated methods need to be implemented to match the experimental band gap.
3.2 Multiple Dirac cones
The Dirac cone92 refers to a conceptual feature related with the band structure to describe the unusual electron transport property exhibited by 2D materials. At energies near the Fermi level, the conduction and valence bands take the shape of the lower and upper halves of a conical surface, meeting at what are called Dirac points, facilitating a huge movement of charge carriers. This concept is potentially useful in explaining the role of suitable 2D materials, including the MPX3 family for unconventional Hall responses and the multiple valley operations.
Sugita et al.,93 through their elegant ab initio calculation, disclosed that MPX3 materials having a honeycomb network of 4d and 5d for transition metal cations may demonstrate multiple Dirac cones. The multiple Dirac cones are evidenced in the electronic structure of the half-filled eg orbitals, and are basically found to be gapped by the spin–orbit coupling under the trigonal lattice distortion. Furthermore, these can be tuned by the tensile strain. Additionally, electron correlations and carrier doping can influence the multiple Dirac semimetal to change into a topological ferromagnet with high Chern number. In their work, they considered Ni, Pb, and Pt as cations. In Fig. 3, the microscopic origin of the multiple Dirac cones has been clarified by showing the maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWF)s94 obtained from two initial states, d3z2−r2 and dx2−y2 (Fig. 3a and b, respectively). Both MLWFs spread well over the neighbouring S sites, representing the importance of indirect leaping processes via the ligand p orbitals. Fig. 3c shows the atom positions for the calculation of transfer integrals between the two types of MLWFs for the cation–cation bonds up to the fifth neighbours. Captivatingly, the most dominant electron transfer is for the third generation nearest neighbours. This is assumed from the fact that the indirect d–p–d hopping between the nearest neighbours are more or less forbidden, although the d–p–p–d ones for the third neighbours are comparatively widespread, as shown in Fig. 3d and e. A similar argument is available for the magnetic exchange interactions.95 As can be seen in Fig. 3f, two electronic bands eg and t2g near the Fermi level are responsible for the generation of eight Dirac cones (two on the zone boundary, K and K′, and the other six are inside).

3.3. Vibrational properties
It is well known that the phonon is a quantum of vibrational energy of a crystal. It is beneficial to measure or calculate the phonon frequencies for all of the normal vibrational modes of the crystal, relating them back to the basic interatomic forces and calculating forward to obtain many important thermophysical properties (e.g., lattice heat capacity), which are dependent on the atomic vibrations.96 The vibrational properties of ultra-thin two-dimensional (2D) layered materials are extremely correlated to their thickness. The quantum confinement effects in the atomic scale and the presence of weak interlayer vdW interactions in the few layers strongly impact their properties, and brand them to be hooked on the layer number from monolayer to multilayer cases. The low-frequency Raman spectrum plays a key role in determining the layer number and stacking order configurations, and provides a unique opportunity to study the interlayer coupling. The temperature-dependent Raman frequencies can give an estimation of the thermal conductivity, which is an important factor for thermoelectric materials.97
Hashemi et al.98 conjectured the vibrational properties of MPX3 from first-principles calculation. The first-principles were performed to calculate the phonon spectra and Raman intensities for a number of MPX3 compounds, such as MgPS3, MgPSe3, MnPS3, MnPSe3, FePS3, FePSe3, NiPS3, NiPSe3, ZnPS3, ZnPSe3, CdPS3, and CdPSe3. The acquired phonon dispersion relations, together with the high-symmetry directions in the Brillouin zone, and the phonon DOS for MgPS3, MnPS3, ZnPSe3, and CdPSe3 are shown as examples in Fig. 4a–d. All compounds are found to be dynamically stable. There exist two acoustic modes with linear q-dependences conforming to the longitudinal and transversal modes within the plane, and another mode with a quadratic dependence unfolding in the out-of-plane flexural response to the stress if it tries to be bent. All plots exhibit similar orderings of the most substantial atomic contributions as a function of the mode frequency. The metal, chalcogen, and phosphorus contributions mostly play roles at the low, middle, and high frequencies, respectively. When relating materials of different elements, the shift of the frequencies can be intuitively tacit based on different atomic masses. The frequencies of both the flat bands and high-frequency bands are mostly independent of the metal atoms. The calculated Raman spectra are presented in Fig. 4e and f (with the artificial broadening of 4 cm−1 to imitate the experimental spectra) for MPS3 and MPSe3 (M: Fe, Ni, Cd, Zn, Mn, Mg), and the absolute values of the Raman intensities (I), which are listed in Table 3. Overally, a radical sensitivity to the chalcogen anion is palpable, whereas the spectra seem fairly insensitive to the metal cation. However, the two lowest eg modes have the strongest metal atom contributions. The shaded regions designate the Raman spectra of the compounds under a 4% strain, and impart a quick pictorial indication regarding the fluctuations. As anticipated, stretching deteriorates the bond strength, and therefore shifts the frequencies to lower wave numbers. In brief, such studies involving vibrational spectra are helpful in determining the relative softness through the assessment of the elastic properties by comparing the Raman spectra of the strained and unstrained stuff.

3.4. Optical properties
Light absorption,99 light emission,100 and exciton/dielectric screening101 are a few of the very important phenomena that contribute to the superior optical properties of the layered MPX3 over their bulk counterparts. Light absorption in 2D materials can surprisingly be much more intense than in bulk crystal counterparts. Light emission in layered MPX3s transforms considerably with stacking sequence, as well as with the number of layers. The feeble dielectric screening, strong light–matter interaction, and sturdily bound excitons are characteristic features of the low-dimensional 2D MPX3s. Defects strongly impact the optical properties that can be perceived as a consequence of the weak screening. The tuning of the optical properties in 2D-materials by modulating the carrier mobility to enhance the surface chemistry of the substrate are novel facets of profound practical interest.102 Research for the optical properties of MPX3 are aimed at the development of a suitable catalyst for the photocatalytic and allied reactions related with water splitting, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution for a greener energy era in the future.
Liu et al.34 calculated the band edges of many single layer MPX3 compounds through first-principles calculation. Specifically, they observed that the single-layer Ag0.5Sc0.5PSe3, which is a direct band gap semiconductor, possesses outstanding light absorption properties. By employing the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) and HSE06 functionals to compute the optical absorption spectra of promising photocatalysts, such as single layer (SL) ZnPSe3, MgPSe3, and Ag0.5Sc0.5PSe3, it was realized (Fig. 5a) that comparing SL MgPSe3, the larger absorption for SL Ag0.5Sc0.5PSe3 in the visible light region, is primarily due to the absorption shift to lower energies due to a smaller bandgap (2.66 eV). Although SL Ag0.5Sc0.5PSe3 has a larger bandgap than that of SL ZnPSe3 (2.31 eV), it still encounters greater photon absorption in the visible light region because of the direct semiconductor nature of Ag0.5Sc0.5PSe3, which is mostly favourable for electron transition. Application of the strain controls both band edges and bandgaps. As shown in Fig. 5b, a 4% tensile strain affects the enhancement of the optical absorption of SL MgPSe3 in the visible light region. Optical non-linearity is an important observation for MnPS3 and CdPS3, while intercalated with DAMS+ (4-[2-(4-dimethylamino-phenyl)ethenyl]-1-methylpyridinium) organic dye, resulting in spontaneous polarization.103 Photoluminescence is an important observation for many MPX3 compounds with the prospect of optical polarization in the spin–valley space. This is vastly beneficial for further theoretical and practical exploration for more sophisticated electronic usage in terms of the usage of the advantages stemming from the interband transitions in the nearby valleys that support circular dichroism.104,105 In a nutshell, the optical absorption, emission, and photoluminescence are very essential optical properties of 2D nanomaterials, like MPX3 stoichiometry, for the selection of an efficient catalyst for photocatalytic reaction. The effect of the strain on the change in optical properties is also vital to consider their change in charge transfer characteristics during any such reaction.

3.5. Magnetism
The magnetic functionality of 2D layered crystals is vital for spintronic or magnetoelectronic applications.57,106–109 Although experimental studies on the magnetic properties of MPX3 were mostly restricted to bulk crystals,37,110,111 the theoretical calculations of the spin-state were concerted on single-layered nanosheets.48,112 Understanding the prevalent relation between the band structure, magnetic phase, as well as the modulation methods is the essence for predicting the dynamic monolayer magnetic ordering of MPX3 materials.
MPX3 monolayers are determined by theoretical calculations, except for FePS3, which also has experimental evidence. Theoretical studies fundamentally emphasize the magnetic ordering, and the relationship between the band structure and magnetic phase of monolayers. There are four magnetic orderings that include (Fig. 6): ferromagnetism (FM), Neel anti-ferromagnetism (AFM), zigzag AFM (zAFM), and stripy AFM. FM ordering happens when all of the spin-states of the metal atoms have the same orientation.113 Neel anti-ferromagnetic ordering refers to the spin-states in the nearest neighbour metal atoms having an opposite orientation. The zigzag AFM ordering is different by definition from the previous two. Herein, the spin-state of the adjacent metal atom chains are elongated in a zigzag direction with an opposite spin orientation. However, the spin-state of the head-to-head metal atoms for the stripy anti-ferromagnetic ordering chain (lengthwise in the armchair direction) takes an opposite orientation. According to the DFT results, the monolayers MnPX3, VPX3, and NiPX3 (X = S, Se, and Te) choose the AFM ordering, while the nonmagnetic state of the monolayers CuPX3, CoPX3, FePX3, and ZnPX3 is steadier than the others, except for FePS3, which prefers the zAFM ordering. Beyond that, the monolayers CrPS3 and CrPSe3 are ferromagnetic. Markedly, the first-principles calculation proved the existence of a certain correlation between the band and magnetic structure of the monolayer MPX3.48 Monolayer MPX3 nanosheets in general are metallic with ferromagnetic ordering. In particular, the monolayer CoPX3 turned out to be nonmagnetic. The band structures of numerous MPX3 monolayers revealed that the nonmagnetic ones could be semiconductor (FePX3), metal (Cu-based and Co-based MPX3 compounds), or insulator (ZnPX3). The semiconducting materials, such as MnPX3, VPX3, FePX3 and NiPX3, exhibit anti-ferromagnetic ordering, while the Cr-based compounds are metallic with ferromagnetic ordering. Table 4 shows the total energy and work function of a few MPX3 calculated from first-principles for comparing the energies of the antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, and nonmagnetic states in V-, Cr-, Mn-, Fe-, and Ni-based compounds.48,113 It can be perceived that the AFM phase is usually favoured normally over the FM phase.

Recently, numerous studies on the spin properties explored by Raman spectroscopy have reported on the quasi-elastic scattering and spin-phonon coupling, emphasizing the difficulty in the direct measurement of the magnetic behaviours of atomically thin 2D crystals.114,115 The magnetic transition can be pointed out upon observing a change in the Raman spectrum.55 Again, information regarding the magnetic ordering can be extracted from the presence of magnon scattering and a change in the Raman peak positions and intensity.115,116 Exploiting the benefit of the above two phenomena, Wang et al.114 verified the magnetic persistence in monolayer FePS3 nanosheets, observing that the interlayer spin arrangement governs the magnetic structure. The AFM ordering in FePS3 nanosheets with different layers results in zone folding, as found through monitoring the Raman peak intensity (P1a).55 Weak interlayer interactions portray a negligible part on the AFM ordering, as TN is hardly sensitive to the gross layer thickness. In short, for spintronics and allied applications, investigative research for the necessary characterization of magnetic properties of the MPX3 material is vital for selecting the optimum compound with all desired combinations of properties for specific use.
3.6. Ferroelectricity
Ferroelectric ordering is an important phenomenon originating from the crystal lattice spontaneous distortion, resulting in the relative displacements of ionic sublattices (0.05–0.4 Å).79,117–120 Usually, for MPX3, it is observed only on MIMIIP2X6 crystals. This phenomenon is used to employ MPX3 materials towards the manufacturing of energy and data storage device sonar sensors and fire sensors.
CuInP2S6 is regarded as the most studied ferroelectric MPX3.30,31 At the outset, it can be stated that the three proximate atom positions of the Cu atom lead to the formation of sublattices, causing diversity in the crystal symmetry. Maisonneuve et al.117 framed four possible ferroelectric patterns within a AIMIIIP2S6 layer (Fig. 7a–d). These recipe suggestions are potentially helpful in finding new ferroelectric, dipole glass and antiferroelectric phases through constructing a layer of chain structures (e.g., ethane-like or tetrahedral entities) surrounding CuI. Although the polyhedral core is non-essential for dipole ordering, the incorporation of d10 cations into systems with anionic polyhedra and anisotropic morphologies appear to cause variability in the cooperative dipole phenomena, owing to the dynamically favoured ferrielectric configurations. Gave et al.83 studied the AFM phase transitions due to the cooperative Cu+ and Bi3+ ion motion (Fig. 7e and f) in CuBiP2Se6. The room temperature phase is disordered and possesses a P1c symmetry and ABAB stacking. However, upon cooling at 173 K, an intermediate phase appears with Rh symmetry and ABCDEF stacking, followed by fully ordered phase below 97 K with Rh symmetry and ABCDEFGHIJKL stacking. Precisely, the high and tunable absolute permittivity near the ordering transformation temperature is useful for the use of a ferroelectric capacitor, which is smaller than the dielectric one. The spontaneous polarization property, in turn, is exploited for manufacturing the ferroelectric random-access memory (RAM). The inherent piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity stemming from the symmetry consideration is beneficial for the sensing application.

3.7. Strain engineering
Application of strain on the MPX3 monolayers results in a change in their band structure. Hence, it is possible to tailor their properties, which depend on the electronic and band structures by strain engineering. In essence, Xiang et al.121 observed that the nature of the applied strain also plays a critical role in tuning the bandgap. For instance, they observed an initial surge in the bandgap. Afterwards, they observed a subsequent reduction caused by compressive strain, while they only decreased for tensile strain. Although a transition between the direct and indirect bandgaps was observed for ZnPS3, ZnPSe3, and CdPSe3, the bandgap of CdPS3 always remained in the indirect regime under a compressive strain (Fig. 8a). In the case of the tensile strain for the above four compounds, the VBM (valence band maximum) is located at the Κ point and the CBM (conduction band minimum) is located at the Γ point, so a phase transition does not exist. In Fig. 8b, the plots for the band gaps from the VB to the CB, including Γ → Γ, Κ → Κ, Κ → Γ, and Γ → Κ, are shown for CdPS3 and CdPSe3. For CdPSe3, the bandgap maxima, which is 12% more than the unstrained case (black line), is situated at the boundary of the indirect and direct states. The origin of the indirect–direct transitions is mainly due to the spin–orbit coupling. Under strain, the lattice parameters change the atomic coordination, as well as the interactions with neighbouring atoms. The effect of strain might induce a change in the peak position in the normalized Raman spectrum, as discussed earlier in Fig. 4e and f.98 A study of the influence of strain on the band structure is thus vital for detecting a change in their optical and magnetic properties, which are important for the photocatalytic chemical reactions and spintronics and magnetoelectric applications, respectively.

(b) The change in the energy gaps of CdPS3 and CdPSe3, including Γ → Γ (black), Κ → Κ (red), Κ → Γ (blue), and Γ → Κ (green) transitions, where the regions of I, II, and III represent the indirect, direct, and indirect band gaps, respectively.121 
3.8. Intercalation effect
Intercalation is a rescindable chemical process to supplement foreign species, including atoms, molecules and ions, into the gap of the crystal system. The remarkable presence of wide van der Waals gaps in MPX3 compounds generates an appropriate platform for the practical recognition of intercalation chemistry. For illustration, alkali metals are found to chemically and electrochemically intercalate into the MPX3 crystals.122 Among them, NiPS3, CoPS3, and FePS3 can easily interact with butyl-lithium, whereas ZnPS3, CdPS3, and MnPS3 do not. Considering the MPS3 crystal structure, lithium cations occupy all of the octahedral sites in the vdW, resulting in the formation of the product Li1.5MPS3 (i.e., Li3M2P2S6). Intercalation might cause incidence of negative free carriers and a decrement of magnetic susceptibility in LixNiPS3.76 A high formation energy associated with the potential difference between Li+/Li and the accommodating d level (the most suitable is Ni) for the intercalation (ideal size of vdW gap) triggers a high potential of the host compound for usage in manufacturing Li ion batteries.123 The unchanged cell volume is a robust advantage of the MPS3 materials for usage as a cathode. Again, for MPX3 compounds, the ionic nature allows them to be treated as ionic salts, where the metal ions are mutually connected by [P2S6]4− bridging ligands.66 Therefore, the intercalation is well described by the ion-exchange mechanism prompted by the high mobility of the metal cations.
Lacroix et al. observed that the intercalation process induces a spontaneous poling during the synthesis of stilbazolium–MPS3 nanocomposites. In a cadmium derivative, an efficiency of 750 times that of urea was observed in the second-harmonic generation.103 In this regard, they formed a schematic structural model to take into account that the DAMS species (4-[2-(4-dimethyl- aminophenyl)ethenyl]-1-methylpyridinium) was oriented “edge on” and closely packed for maintaining the host/guest ratio (Fig. 9a). Ouvrard87 theorized a model for the migration of reduced Ni atoms within precisely known sites, so as to deduce a hypothetical structure for the intercalated phase Li:NiPS3. The simultaneous occupation of adjacent sulphur tetrahedra must be taken into account in these theorized models. In Fig. 9b, for better clarity, the projection of the NiPS3 structure perpendicular to one of the slabs is represented. That means that only one slab refers to the cationic layers (nickel and phosphorus atoms) between two sulphur layers. If a given Ni atom is considered at an octahedral site, then six adjacent tetrahedra can be suitable for a plausible migration. This can be seen as three pairs of tetrahedra between two octahedra engaged by P–P pairs. If it is supposed that the same kind of migration is employed in the whole structure, the possible structure of Li2NiPS3 can be represented by Fig. 9c. Herein, the arrows symbolize a feasible scheme for the migration procedure. In summary, consideration of the intercalation in MPX3 materials is crucial for improving the performance of the Li ion battery and the synthesis of special materials, where the reaction kinetics are determined by ion movement.

4. Advanced applications of MPX3
4.1. Catalysis
The peculiar MPX3 materials are well-endowed with unique physicochemical characteristics, leading to potential applications with respect to the energy conversion/storage. The unique energy band structure highly contributes towards the outstanding photocatalytic, photoelectronic and electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, an appropriate bandgap is primarily significant for the experimental realization of the photo-electrochemical reactions.

4.1.1. Photocatalysis. 
The variable elements in MPX3 contribute to the wide experimental bandgaps (1.2–3.5 eV), providing an opportunity for exceptionally wide-ranging light absorption responses.35,74,85 Additionally, the carrier mobility of monolayer MPX3 materials is accounted to be high, which favors the lessening of the chance of an electron–hole recombination. These captivating photoelectrochemical properties are the impetus to various light harvesting applications (photoelectronic and photo/electro catalytic).32,57,75,113,124,125 Hydrogen generation by photocatalytic water splitting is one of the promising and efficient methods for solar energy conversion, which essentially labels an endogenic reaction triggered by a visible light source to overcome the Gibbs free energy of 1.23 eV. The light absorbing materials with appropriate band energy positions, i.e., CBM higher than the reduction potential of H+/H2 and VBM lower than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O, are adequate for water splitting. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the single layer MPX3 material possess outstanding properties for light absorption with high stability and versatile electronic properties.34Fig. 10a and b shows the comparative positions of the CB and VB energy levels, and the visible range absorption details of some of the MPS3 (M denotes Fe, Zn, Ni, Cd, Mn) and MPSe3 (M denotes Mn and Fe) material monolayers, predicting them to be thermodynamically appropriate for photocatalysis. The exploratory research for the photo-electrochemical property of single layered MPX3 materials (such as NiPS3, FePS3,169 SnPS3 and MnPSe3) were initiated in the early 1980s.127 The extensive photoelectronic studies of the p-type FePS3 and FePSe3 single crystals exhibited visible region quantum efficiencies with two kinds of indirect transitions for each one. The optical transitions were 1.62 and 2.3 eV for FePSe3, and 1.3 and 1.83 eV for FePS3. The electronic band positions interpreted the presence of the localized d-levels, current voltage characteristics, carrier mobilities, flat band position, as well as the minor recombination.128 In particular, the 2D MnPSe3 semiconductor monolayer, an active visible light absorber evidences an electron mobility of 25.9 cm2 V−1 S−1 and hole mobility is 34.7 cm2 V−1 S−1 for photogenerated carriers.33 Superior performance of the 2D MnPSe3 over MnPS3 is attributed to the enriched electron conduction band due to the cluster orbitals P2X64−, resulting in a theoretically more visible region absorption. However, experimental studies using electron spin resonance spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy to detect the oxygen intermediate species (such as surface hydroxyl radicals) resulted in the suppression of O2 evolution. Although strong H+ adsorption and H2 desorption was easier, water molecule oxidation due to the photogenerated holes and the presence of sulphur vacancies largely overturn the formation of O2 generation.129 The ultrathin hexagonal crystal of NiPS3 showed a constant H2 generation rate of ∼26.42 μmol g−1 h−1 and 6.46 μmol g−1 h−1 for xenon light (λ > 300 nm) and solar illumination, respectively, with superior stability performance (Fig. 10c–g).56 However, FePS3, CdPS3 and In2/3PS3 also showed excellent light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution ability with rates of 402.4 μmol g−1 h−1, 786.6 μmol g−1 h−1 and 379.1 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively, under the simulated solar illumination.124 Computational DFT analysis distinguished the nitrogen-doped CdPS3 as a viable candidate for visible light hydrogen production with the relative narrowing of the bandgap.130 Anionic mono-doping offers high stability, enhancing the solar driven hydrogen yield.126 Nevertheless, the experimental realization of the overall photocatalytic water spitting for MPX3 compounds is still unmapped, which can afford an exciting opportunity in the field of relevant energy conversion.

4.1.2. Electrocatalysis. 
The superior intrinsic conductivity and high surface area with copious dominant active locales of the atomic level thickness MPX3 have recently attracted wide attention towards electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).131–136 The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution application mainly arises due to the presence of P-sites, which are postulated to be active for hydrogen adsorption and desorption.133,137 Pumera and co-workers investigated a comparative HER of few layered MPSe3 (M = Cd, Cr, Fe, Mn, Sn, Zn) and MPS3 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Cd, Sn, Zn). From the comparative studies on selenides, FePSe3 yielded the utmost efficiency for the HER, followed by MnPSe3 in both acidic/alkaline media with reasonable stability after 100 consecutive cycles. From the relative electrocatalytic evaluations in the catalytic terms of MPS3, NiPS3 and CoPS3, the highest efficiency was shown for HER, while the highest performance for OER and ORR activities were shown for CoPS3 and MnPS3, respectively.131 Mukherjee et al. investigated the excellent HER catalytic activities of the few-layered ternary iron seleno-phosphate in a wide pH range (acidic, alkaline, phosphate buffer and 3.5 wt% aqueous NaCl solution) with high stability due to the presence of both P and S as the promising hydrogen adsorption site. The calculated Tafel slope and exchange current density in acid media are reported to be ∼(45–50) mV dec−1 and 1 ± 0.2 × 10−3A cm−2. The above catalyst undergoes adsorption of the OH groups over the surface active sites (As) by the reaction represented as: OH− + As → S–OH + H+ + e, and is primarily responsible for the robust possibility of oxygen evolution underlining OER. When combined with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), the few-layer FePSe3 retains a Tafel polarization (mass transport corrected) slope of 64 mV dec−1 at the Temkin adsorption region (low current density region), confirming better catalytic action towards HER.133,134 A new custom next-generation 2D FePSe3 nanosheet doped with oxygen (FePSe3–O) exhibited outstanding performance recently for bifunctional energy storage/conversion (toward OER and ORR) electrocatalysts. Multiple crystalline–amorphous interfaces generated defect-rich active sites responsible for the decreased Fermi level bandgap due to the oxygen doping (calculation from density functional theory) being highly beneficial for the ion kinetics and long-time durability of the OER and ORR catalysts in alkaline media. A low potential was achieved of about 0.261 V @ 10 mA cm−2 with a small Tafel slope of 41.13 mV dec−1. At ΔE = 0.694 V, the E1/2 and Ej = 10 for ORR and OER were estimated to be 0.797 V and 1.491 V, respectively.135 Recently, Wang et al. demonstrated that by non-metal (B- and C-) heteroatom doping, NiPS3 could transform from semiconducting to a metal, and the surface sites were greatly activated, which favored enhanced HER activities. DFT calculations revealed the emergence of additional electronic states near the Fermi level (EF) after doping B or C, designating the transformation from a semiconductor to metal (Fig. 11a). The adsorption Gibbs free energy of the hydrogen (ΔGH) atom on the possible sites of virgin and doped NiPS3 showed that B or C-doping can effectively activate the basal surfaces of NiPS3 (a more positive ΔGH value implies weaker adsorption) (Fig. 11b). Fig. 11c–f shows the comparative HER activities of doped NiPS3, indicating the order of o-NiPS3 < NiPS3 < N–NiPS3 < B–NiPS3 < C–NiPS3 < C,N–NiPS3. C-doped NiPS3 exhibited the optimum activity attributable to its moderate filled state of the valence band, and the C,N-co-doped NiPS3 showed Pt-like activity with an over potential of 53.2 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and exchange current density of 0.7 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH.137 In another report on the fundamental understanding of the self-constructed NiPS3 catalyst towards OER, the surface electronic structure of the Ni metal are greatly modulated by the hybridization involving the S and P sites. The improved kinetics with durable stability is detected as a result of Ni oxidation and the formation of a NiPS3–NiOOH heterostructure in the OER reaction interface.138,139 Pristine few-layered NiPS3 nanosheets also exhibit excellent electrochemical properties towards water oxidation in the sense of the cycling performance, long-term durability, overpotential and Tafel slope as low as of 301 mV (at a current density of 10 mA cm−2), 43 mV dec−1, respectively.140 Song et al. investigated the bifunctional electrocatalyst Ni0.9Fe0.1PS3for OER and HER from a chain of mixed nickel iron phosphosulfides Ni1−xFexPS3 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 1). Interestingly, the surface generated hydroxide components Ni(Fe)OOH and Ni(Fe)(OH)2 promoted the OER efficiency in alkaline media.141

4.2. Field effect transistors and photodetectors
Few-layered MPX3 materials exfoliated from its bulk crystal have been used as the active material for field effect transistors (FETs) due to its low cleavage energy.32,142–145 Apart from that, the adjustable bandgaps (1.2–3.5 eV) covering a wide range spanning the infrared to UV region, the high carrier mobility, quicker response, and high detection limits reserved 2D MPX3s to be splendid candidates for reliable optoelectronic device purposes. The narrow thickness of the 2D semiconductors in the vertical axis efficiently regulates the carrier density. Application of opposite gate biases accelerates the electron–hole pair separation in turn, resulting in high photo responses. The 2D nanodimension semiconductor phosphochalcogenides promote miniaturization. The van der Waals force of interaction makes them highly compatible to substrates, forming heterostructures for the development of microfabricated devices. Recently, NiPS3 nanosheet-based photodetectors evidenced good device performance with a remarkably faster response time (3.2 ms), recovery time (17.5 ms), and responsivity (∼126 mA W−1) under the illumination of a weak (254 nm) light source and ultra-low dark current of <10 fA at room temperature. The device possessed wide spectral selectivity from 210 nm (peak) to 360 nm (cut-off), and a significant detectivity of 1.22 × 1012 jones.142 The study of the transport properties, such as the height of the tunneling barrier and dielectric breakdown strength, highly encourages the exploration of the application towards field effect transistors and magnetic tunnel junctions. The thickness-dependent I–V spectroscopic analysis of mono- and few-layers of MnPS3 exfoliated over an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated Si substrate (indium tin oxide/MnPS3/Pt–Ir tip junction) examined the features of both Schottky junction and Fowler–Nordheim tunneling (FNT). From the FNT model, the tunneling barrier height was estimated to be 1.31 eV and the dielectric breakdown strength as 5.41 MV cm−1 (assuming the effective electron mass to be 0.5me).143 Gao et al. reported the FETs based UV (254 nm) photodetectors based on the few-layer FePS3, manifesting both positive and negative photoconductivities under a controlled gate bias. The responsivity for FePS3 (R = Iphoto/Pincident), where Iphoto is the photocurrent and Pincident is the incident power at zero bias is accounted to be 12.3 mA W−1, with response and recovery times of 105 ms and 120 ms. Under a negative gate bias of −40 V responsivity, it increases to 171.6 mA W−1.144 Sampath and coworkers successfully fabricated the first FETs based on bulk and few layered NiPS3 with gold contacts revealed n-type conductivity with on/off ratios of ∼103 to 105 at 25 °C. The Schottky barrier for the device was extracted as 112 meV. Experimental and theoretical calculations predicted the on-state current, threshold voltage and spin behavioral details by electron/hole doping.145 Kumar et al. reported on the p-type conductivity with an on–off ratio of ∼103 and mobility of 8.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the FETs based on few-layered MnPS3. The output characteristics of the FET device showed p-type semiconducting properties with an increase in the current by increasing the negative gate voltage (Fig. 12). The photodetectors based on the MnPS3 FETs showed good UV (365 nm) photodetector performance with a responsivity of ∼288 A W−1 (Fig. 12d–h). The photodetector mechanism is understood by the energy band diagram, which followed a similar type charge transport, as reported for photodetectors based on the 2D layered metal trichalcogenide materials (Fig. 12h).146 Thus, it is interesting to note that the eminent and novel properties of the metal phosphorus-based photodetectors provide room for further optimization of the spin-electron, electronic, or optoelectronic applications.

4.3. Chemical sensors
The tunable electrical properties of MPX3 (by varying the M and X elements) make them ideal candidates for its possible application as resistive chemical sensors.147–149 Due to its p-type semiconducting properties with a bandgap of 3.0 eV and low conductivity value of ∼10−12 S cm−1, the MnPS3 nanosheets have been explored for humidity and NO2 gas sensing application. The p-MnPS3 showed a very fast dynamic response to humidity with a decrease in the resistance of the film to 5–6 orders of magnitude for a change in the relative humidity (RH) from 0%–98% with a response time of 1–2 s and recovery time of ∼4 s.147 Kumar et al. reported on selective NO2 sensors based on the few-layered MnPS3 with a sensitivity of 95.30% for 30 ppm NO2 (Fig. 13).148Fig. 13a and b show the schematic illustration and optical image of the fabricated sensor device. The MnPS3 sensor showed good reversibility and high selectivity toward NO2 gas with respect to the interferents NO, NH3, H2, CO, CO2, C2H2 and O2 (Fig. 13). Raman spectroscopy studies of the MnPS3 sensors before and after NO2 gas exposure indicated a decrease in the intensity of the A1g and E2g bands, revealing the charge transfer process between MnPS3 and NO2 molecules due to the strong adsorption process. Jenjeti et al. investigated real time flexible, stable, highly reversible and most importantly contactless humidity sensors with ultrafast dynamics based on NiPS3 with a responsivity of 1.8 × 109, reproducibility and low response time (∼1–2 s) and recovery time (∼2–3 s).149

4.4. Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)
Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a powerful and sensitive analytical technique for various biomedical applications. Examples include the investigation of biomolecules, detection of cancerous cells, blood sample analysis, and many more.150 The physical parameters that characterize the Raman scattering process are mainly the local electric field and the molecular polarizability. The SERS processes are well understood by electromagnetic and chemical two enhancement mechanisms. In the chemical mechanism process, the photo-induced charge transfer processes (PICT) are divided into two categories, depending on the charge transfer from substrate to molecule or molecule to substrate. Fig. 14a shows the schematic illustration of the two models of SERS-active substrates detecting rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecules under 532 nm, and it is predicted that the SERS-active materials have a bandgap of ∼2.33 eV for detecting R6G molecules under 532 nm laser excitation. Hou et al. employed an alloy engineering method for MPX3 (MnPS3−xSex, 0 ≤ x ≤ 3) for SERS, in which the coupling of the exciton resonance (μex) and PICT is applied to screen out materials for SERS enhancement. By this alloying approach, the band gap of MnPS3 is attuned to match the band energy of the R6G molecule, which lead to the achievement of good performance with a detection limit down to 10−9 M (Fig. 14b–d). The band gap analysis of MnPS3 and MnPS3−xSex (0 ≤ x ≤ 3), showed that the synergistic resonances between PICT and μex contributed significantly for the Raman enhancement (Fig. 14f and g).151

4.5. Energy storage devices
Due to their key structural attributes and diverse physicochemical properties, novel MPX3 based 2D materials emerge as electrode materials for energy storage devices.122,132,152–154 Also, 2D MPX3 materials possess several advantages, including: (i) a lower energy barrier for fast electron transport, (ii) abundant ion diffusion pathways, and (iii) excellent electrochemical and thermal stability, mechanical durability, which are favorable for energy storage applications. However, the high crystallinity, high surface area and superior interfacial contact with the electrolyte or current collector of MPX3 make them high performing electrode materials for the Li/Na battery. The detailed storage mechanisms of CoPS3, FePS3, NiPS3 lithium (LIB) and sodium ion batteries (SIB) were investigated by Yan157 and co-researchers. Extensive examination of the electrochemical performance from cyclic voltammograms suggested the existence of controlled electrochemical behaviors (diffusion and capacitive controlled). Smaller specific capacities for SIB compared to LIB are mainly assigned to the huge and bulky size effect, as well as poor mobility of the Na+ ions. At a particular scan rate of 2 mV s−1, the NiPS3, CoPS3, and FePS3 nanosheets contributed a capacitive sodium storage of 68%, 74%, and 78% for the electrodes, respectively. It is worth noting that SIBs relying on the intercalated NiPS3 delivered a capacity of 1090 and 536 mA h g−1 at 0.05 and 5.0 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 88% after 200 cycles at 2.0 A g−1. The intercalation step of sodium involves xNa + NiPS3 → NaxNiPS3 without the phase transformation. The evidenced broad peak in the CV profiles and a supported gentle plateau in the galvanostatic charge discharge profile at the potential window of 0.3–1.0 V verified the presence of Na2S, NaxP, and metallic Ni in SIBs. Further improvement of the ion accessibility and diffusion for better Li/Na storage performance intrinsically employed the propylamine polymer intercalation.152 An anode material NiPS3 for LIBs was quite stable up to the 150th cycle with a reversible specific capacity of 796.2 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, and showed an excellent electrochemical response with a rate capability of 318.34 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1.136 All solid-state lithium secondary batteries assembled using the FePS3 electrode with 10 mg loading and sulfide-based solid electrolytes delivered reversible charge–discharge behavior with a discharge capacity of 107 mA h g−1 (1 mA cm−2) at the 30th cycle.155 Ding et al. employed the 2D/2D heterojunction (FePS3@MXene) hybrid for sodium ion battery application, wherein MXene was denoted to be the active promoter of the fast electron/ion transfer (Fig. 15).154 Uniformly coated few layered FePS3 nanosheets by MXene showed exceptional reversible capacity of 676 mA h g−1 after 90 cycles (with ∼90% retention from the second cycle capacity of ∼746.4 mA h g−1). The assembled full sodium-ion cell cycle exhibited a coulombic efficiency of 91% after 29 cycles with a reversible capacity of 302 mA h g−1. The maximum energy and power density for the full cell are 424 W h kg−1 and 131 W kg−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 20 cycles, respectively. In metal–air batteries, the replacement of the precious metal component has been a major challenge in the recent decade due to the high corrosion and poor stability.156 2D FePSe3–O nanosheets fabricated followed by the Ar/O2 plasma treatment were used as the cathode for the flexible solid-state rechargeable liquid zinc-air batteries (ZABs). ZABs showed satisfying performance with an enhanced round trip efficiency of 57.1%, high flexibility, and durable stability (charge/discharge voltage drop of 13.51% after 800 cycles) that efficiently boosts its capability for the fulfillment of realistic energy demands. Theoretical calculations through DFT also inferred superior Fermi level electronic states of O-doped FePSe3 nanosheets compared to its bulk counterpart.135 In another case, the hybrid structure MnPS3/rGO with hierarchically architectured MnPS3 and incorporation of the conductive graphene scaffold collectively endow outstanding performances due to the enhanced volume for the charge promotion and transport phenomena in SIBs. The performance could elucidate the high reversibility, improved specific capacity, rate capability, and cycle life. The MnPS3/rGO composite restores a specific capacity of 290 mA h g−1 even after the 150 cycles, including a capacity retention of 92%.157 Cathodes for the Li ion battery that are sustainable at high temperatures and high CO2 pressures are the requirements for NASA's Venus surface mission entitled as Long-Lived In situ Solar System Explorer (LLISSE) Venus lander, as the atmospheric pressure and temperature for the environment on Venus is 465 °C, 92 atm due to the surrounding dense sulphuric acid clouds. Apart from that, applications like missiles, radars, electronic back power systems in military artilleries also demand longstanding temperature resistance and power backup systems. Finally, future high temperature batteries probing manganese, iron, cobalt and nickel phosphorus trisulfides were examined at cloned high-temperature (475 °C) laboratory. The voltammetric cycling and charge discharge performances extracted NiPS3 to be suitable for the above applications, and beyond maintaining functional order as MnPS3 ≤ NiPS3 < FePS3.158

Several compounds belonging to the MTP clan of materials were also substantiated to be efficient at diatomic hydrogen storage ability because of the high storage capacity, robust kinetics, long-term cyclic stability, and advantageous sorption thermodynamics. Hydrogen can be stored in solid materials through physisorption, chemisorption and chemical reaction mechanisms. The most stable physisorption technique involves a solid sorbent material surface that permits the H2 absorption for reversible storage. Experimentally, at moderate pressure and temperatures (80.15, 173.15 and 298.15 K), the gravimetric hydrogen storage ability of the MnPS3 layered material was tested. DFT simulations used a quantum-thermodynamic model function, in which pores are modeled between the two parallel layered MnPS3. All of the calculations were carried out by taking into account the temperature, pressure and pore widths. Although H2 adsorption under the physisorption mechanism was found to be energetically favourable, its contributions for the hydrogen storage were quite low due to the process of pore compressions occurring between the layers. A reasonable resemblance was obvious from both experimental and theoretical observations. However, the intercalation and storage of H2 molecules in the vdW gap in bulk MnPS3 are still in progress.159 For the first time ever, Ismail and co-workers reported the hydrogen storage capacity to be 1.2 wt% of the thermal stable NiPS3 (630 °C) at an applied 20 bar hydrogen pressure and 80 K temperature. Mostly molecular hydrogen is absorbed, as their operational temperature is close to the liquid nitrogen temperature and is trapped in the interplanar gaps by vdW forces.47 Later on, a similar pressure-isotherm investigation was also performed for different materials, including MnPS3 (ref. 160) and FePS3,46 by the aforementioned group of researchers. The abovementioned state-of-the-art work opens up new avenues for further investigation on the energy storage applications of MPX3-based materials and its nanoengineering for enhanced performance (Table 5).

5. Strategies for the growth of MPX3
The fascinating anisotropic properties and functional applications of the exceptional layered MPX3 based materials, either in the form of atomic thin layer or nano/micro dimensionally structured morphology, hinge on the advancements of the fundamental synthesis and growth approaches. Very recent advances in the synthetic growth strategies for this family of materials are discussed in the succeeding section. Broad classification of the preparation methods used for MPX3 synthesis includes the typical bottom-up and top-down approaches. The classic bottom-up approaches include the solid-state reactions via chemical vapor transport (CVT), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and solvothermal method. The top-down methods include exfoliation, micro-mechanical, ball milling, liquid phase exfoliation and electrochemical exfoliation. Most of the synthesis protocols comprehends the heating of the pure precursor of corresponding elements in fused silica ampoule at an appropriate temperature and portion, followed by a time-consuming slow cooling rate. However, another popular technique for ultrathin thio/selenophosphates is micromechanical exfoliation to achieve crystal quality and features that are relevant for specific applications.
5.1. Bottom-up approaches
The CVT approach utilizes a vapor transportation mechanism for the precursor species, leading to single crystals.33,158 Friedel et al. were the first to ever reported the synthesis of MPX3 materials in 1894, in which the heating of phosphorus pentasulfide and iron was carried out to achieve the FePS3 crystal.35 Down the lane, analogous modified CVT approaches are exploited to produce a variety of other homo- and hetero-structured MPX3 compounds. The basic vapor transport agents (phosphorus, selenium and sulfur) have high vapor pressure, low melting points and boiling points (except sulfur) used as the source at suitable stoichiometric amounts at different temperature zones.161 The typical reaction temperature for the vapor transport for selenium and sulfur was above the decomposition temperature, ranging between 400–800 °C.83 The solid precursors were placed in a high temperature gradient system, in quartz ampoules that were sealed containers, which prevented contaminants from the environment. In CVT, a condensed phase, typically a solid precursor is used to get volatilized in the presence of a gaseous reactant called as transport agent (I2), and the final product is deposited at a lower temperature zone (T1), as compared to the heating temperature (T2) of the source. In certain procedures, iodine is employed as the transporting agent. In that case, the stoichiometric proportions of the sources together with metal, chalcogen and phosphorus powders, are mixed along with the transport agent (I2). They are heated in a quartz ampoule at a particular temperature for a certain period of time to achieve greater crystallinity. CVT can be considered as a modified CVD method classified amongst one of the influential techniques to achieve high quality crystals with more control on the doping, phase tuning, defect and vacancy engineering.162–166
FePX3 (X = S, Se) is synthesized by heating stoichiometric Fe, P and S/Se powders at 700 °C in a sealed quartz tube for 24 h, followed by heating the mixed phase in a quartz ampoule with two temperature zones of 720–700 °C with iodine as the transport medium for 7 days.165,167 Black colored platelets, like crystals of the FePX3 crystals with 0.01–0.1 mm thickness and ∼0.5–1 mm2 in size, are achieved by this approach. In the typical process for the preparation of the FePS3 crystals, two-step processes are involved. In the first step, a stoichiometric ratio (Fe/P/S = 1:1:3) of the elements are heated in the sealed quartz ampoule under vacuum (10−6 mbar) at 750 °C for several days. In the second step, the obtained products are further heated in an inert atmosphere at a relatively lower temperature (∼500 °C) to remove excess sulfur and red phosphorus.167 Du et al. and some of the other researchers prepared MPS3 (M = Fe, Mn, Ni, Cd and Zn) and MPSe3 (M = Fe and Mn) crystals by following a standardized CVT approach.32,114,142,143 A stoichiometric amount of metal elements (mole ratio M:P:chalcogen = 1:1:3, total mass ∼ 1 g) and iodine (∼10–20 mg) as the transport agent were vacuum-sealed in a quartz ampoule (l = 16 cm, w = 13 mm, pressure ∼ 1 × 10−4 torr), and kept in a two-zone furnace (650–600 °C) for 1 week to achieve the crystals. Pumera and co-workers reported the synthesis of a wide range of MPX3 (MnPS3, FePS3, CoPS3, NiPS3, ZnPS3, CdPS3, SnPS3) by following a similar CVT approach with varied heating temperatures (550 °C–750 °C) and duration of heating (120–300 h) of the ampoule sealed under high vacuum (below 5 × 10−3 Pa).50Fig. 16 shows the representative optical and SEM images of MPX3 crystals grown by CVT approach.127,133,141,145,164 The crystals are formed by the CVT by maintaining the heating zone temperature (700 °C–650 °C) for 7 days. Hou et al. reported the alloy engineering of MnPX3 by CVT approach to achieve MnPS3−xSex (0 ≤ x ≤ 3).151

CVD is one of the commanding bottom-up methodologies for the preparation of high quality uniform thin films, heterostructures and crystals, in which a carrier gas is used to move the volatile reactants to get deposited on a substrate or on the walls of the chamber. The major shortcoming of CVT is that the crystals formed by this approach are comparatively bigger in size with a lower specific surface area. Shifa et al. described the growth of MPX3 (X = S, Se) nanosheets on a flexible carbon fiber substrate by CVD, wherein pre-grown MnO2 is converted to phosphorus trichalcogenides under optimized circumstances.129 In this approach, the MnO2 nanowire arrays grown on a carbon fiber were placed at the back zone, and the mixture of P and S precursors was kept at the front zone of a tube furnace. To begin with, the front zone was heated to 110 °C for 10 min to generate the thiophosphate/seleno phosphate atmosphere, which carried the P and S vapor to the zone where MnO2 was positioned. By maintaining the front zone temperature at 280 °C (MnPS3) or 300 °C (MnPSe3) and the posterior zone temperature at 450 °C (MnPS3) or 500 °C (MnPSe3) for two continuous hrs with 100 sccm Ar gas flow, high-quality trichalcogenide nanosheets were grown. By a similar CVD approach, Wang et al. conveyed the growth of NiPS3 ultra-thin crystals by placing the mixture of red phosphorus and sulfur powder (2:5 molar ratio) at the front zone, and the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets grown on substrates (ITO, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and carbon fibers) at the back zone (Fig. 17).56 The front zone temperature was maintained at 300 °C, and the back zone temperature at 470 °C for 30 min under Ar gas flow (20 sccm) to achieve the growth of ultra-thin NiPS3 crystals. Cheng et al. employed the CVD-based phosphosulfurization method to prepare high-quality layered FePS3 nanosheets with a thickness of ∼20 nm. The same approach is also extended to grow InPS3 and CdPS3 (Fig. 18).124 For the growth of FePS3, hydrothermally grown FeS nanoparticles on FTO or carbon fibers were used as the starting material, and the phosphosulfurization process was carried out in a two-zone tube furnace under 10 sccm Ar gas for 120 min with front and back zone temperatures of 330 °C and 550 °C, respectively.

5.2. Top-down approaches
Among the top-down approaches, mechanical, chemical and liquid phase exfoliations are widely used methods to prepare single and few-layered 2D MPX3 and other materials.169–176 Either mechanical or chemical intercalation procedures were taken up in the above cases to separate the layers from its bulk crystals. By controlling the force applied to the bulk crystals and the intercalating medium, single to few-layered 2D materials are achieved since the weak van der Waals force exists between the neighboring layers. Du et al. achieved single layers of MPS3 (M = Fe, Mn, Ni, Cd and Zn) and MnPSe3 (M = Fe and Mn), and provided comparative information on the cleavage energies of these chains of compounds.32 By this approach, bulk crystals of MPX3 are mechanically exfoliated onto oxidized silicon wafers by adhesive tapes.173 By visual inspection on the color contrast change, the thickness of the oxide layer to be used is estimated. For NiPS3, the optimum silicon oxide thickness is estimated to be 90 nm, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy are employed to characterize the materials.
Liquid exfoliation is the widely used approach for the large scale production of single to few layered MPX3 by exfoliating bulk crystals.133,134,145–149,173–175 Briefly, in this technique, the bulk crystals are dispersed in different solvents (e.g., ethanol, acetone, water, proposal, ethanol–water mixture, dimethyl formamide) and ultrasonicated, followed by the separation of the un-exfoliated bulky products. An analogous ultrasonic liquid exfoliation was adopted to convert the stacked bulk to single nanosheet, followed by Ar/O2 plasma treatment in order to introduce oxygen doping in FePSe3.135,177 Ni1−x FexPS3 bulk was exfoliated by ultrasonication-assisted method for 48 h using N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF).141 Similarly, MnPS3 flakes were mechanically exfoliated from bulk materials on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-coated SiO2/Si substrates, followed by removal of the PMMA layer by acetone, and rinsing with isopropanol alcohol.168 In this context, a novel nanohybrid Li2xMn1−xPS3/GO was prepared through mixing the colloidal graphene oxide and an initial intercalation/exfoliation of MnPS3 nanosheets using a 3 M KCl/3 M LiCl at room temperature.44,174 By following this approach, other 2D materials (such as graphene, h-BN, heterojunctions of h-BN/graphene/MnPS3/graphene) are achieved.
The electrochemical cathodic exfoliation methodology is stated to be an efficient method to prepare massive amounts of large-sized and monolayered NiPS3 flakes with high quality (Fig. 19).137,178,179 This method has several advantages, including scalable fabrication, structural reliability with large size, nominal cost, reproducibility and solution processibility. In this approach, the obtained MPX3 crystals are used as the working electrode, the Pt electrode as the counter electrode, and tetra-n-butylammonium tetrafluoroborate in DMF solution as the electrolyte. By applying a static bias of −3.0 V on the working electrode, electrochemical exfoliation of the NiPS3 crystal is achieved. This approach is found to be a sonication-free and fast (in minutes) method to prepare large-sized (typically ∼150 μm2) and thinly layered (∼70% monolayer) NiPS3 flakes with high crystallinity and pure phase structure with a yield of ∼80%. Ding et al. used a combined approach to prepare the novel 2D/2D heterojunction of FePS3 nanosheets@MXene composite, in which the prepared nanosheets of the respective materials are used for in situ mixing process (Fig. 20).154

Another unique technique, ball-milling exfoliation, was reported to be a successful way of producing uniform few-layered nanosheets. Notably, the single crystalline ternary layered iron phosphotrichalcogenide was initially prepared through the CVT system, and was exfoliated to layers by subsequent ball milling via planetary ball mill system. Highly effective zirconium dioxide balls were ball milled at a speed of 580 rev per min for 12 h in the high purity nitrogen (99.99%) environment. Various experimental tools evidenced and characterized the rich defect (creation of holes in the ball milled layered)-induced layered structures. Superior property enhancements characterized through the BET surface area (6.18 m2 g−1 for the pristine FePS3, 49.7 m2 g−1 for the exfoliated FePS3), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and OER activity was observed after the ball-milling treatment.172 In a different study from the literature, a novel 2D/2D heterojunction of ultra-thin MnPS3/rGO composite was prepared by high-energy ball milling combined with graphene, wherein the bulk MnPS3 was synthesized through high-temperature solid-phase reaction process. The resultant unique hybrid highly improves the conductivity, affording plentiful reaction locales, and thus possesses high charge transfer capacity, rate capability, stability, and low diffusion distance in SIBs.157,180
6. Summary and future directions
Layered metal thio(seleno)phosphate (MPX3) compounds are basically cationic MII, MI, and MIII state metal centres coordinated to octahedral sulfur or selenium environments. The strong ionically bonded M cations and [P2X6]4− are the structural backbone to these kinds of materials and the root of various functional features and correlated behaviours. They establish pronounced physical and chemical properties influenced by electronic configuration electronegativity, magnetism, and ferroelectricity, that leads to diverse electronic, optoelectronic, catalytic and energy-related applications. Moreover, the dimension reduction from bulk to nano structurization of the bulky counterpart critically triggers the interesting properties, leading to intensive applications.
The crystal field splitting of the partially filled d-orbitals affecting the electronic structures, ionic bonding, spin ordering near the Fermi level at the cationic sites of FePS3, NiPS3, MnPSe3 and MnPS3 influences their magnetic ordering. Modulation methods are the essence for predicting the dynamic monolayer magnetic ordering. They can be correlated to the magnetic or ferroelectric ordering, enabling the suitability for spintronics and allied applications. Meanwhile, the high degree of tunability by anion mono-doping can precisely tune the sub-electronic configuration of the semiconductor or Mott insulators, enabling them for 2D electronic devices (FETs, detectors). Additionally, the electron correlations, magnetic exchange interactions and carrier doping can influence the multiple Dirac semimetals to change into a topological ferromagnet with high Chern number, which further experiences unconventional Hall responses and the multiple valley operations. The quantum confinement effects in the atomic scale and the presence of weak interlayer vdW interaction vibrational properties correlated to the thickness (layer number from monolayer to multilayer) strongly impact their properties. The low-frequency Raman spectrum plays a key role in determining the layer number and stacking order configurations, and provides a unique opportunity to study the interlayer coupling. Light absorption/emission, exciton/dielectric screening at a unique board bandgap spanning within 1.3–3.5 eV are favorable for a potential application in optoelectronics and photo(electro)chemical catalysis applications. The indirect–direct transitions are modulations of the quasi-elastic scattering and spin–phonon coupling. Precisely, the high and tunable absolute permittivity near the ordering transformation temperature is useful for the spontaneous polarization property exploits, manufacturing ferroelectric RAM. The inherent piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity stemming from the symmetry consideration is beneficial for sensing applications. The 2D MPX3 crystals with ultrathin thickness, larger surface area, defect interface, tunable interlayer spacings, and high conductivity possess a robust interface for catalytic energy conversion/storage. Under the influence of strain, the lattice parameters change the atomic coordination, as well as the interactions with neighbouring atoms, laying the foundation of the origin of strain engineering. The intercalation of the alkali metal/ion (Li+/Li or Na+/Na) with high formation energy and high ion mobility accommodating the d level through an ion exchange mechanism triggers a high potential of the host compound for usage in manufacturing lithium and sodium ion batteries.
The state-of-the-art growth status of bulk/layered structures focuses on sophisticated methods via CVD/CVT. However, the realization of the monolayer is established through ultrasonicator-assisted exfoliation, which is analogous to the other 2D transition metal dichalcogenides. Many of the MTP designs are limited to the theoretical aspects, and more efforts for the preferable and controllable experimental growth for specific applications with cost-effective techniques require rigorous development.
In a nutshell, this review deliberately elaborated the crystal structure, properties (physical chemical and electrochemical), along with the growth approaches and applications of MPX3 crystals. Herein, the re-emergence of phosphorus trichalcogenides and their hybrid materials after the 1980s, along with the detailed crystal structure–property correlations, and most importantly, the diverse potential applications in the recent two decades are critically surveyed in this bit of work. This review article especially accentuates some of the barely touched facets not overviewed in the existing reviews by auditing multiple Dirac cone, vibrational properties, and strain engineering. Both theoretical and experimental attempts have been systematically outlined. This review sheds new insights that may lead to intriguing future work in the MTP endeavours.
As a final note, it can be claimed that the unprecedented advantages of the van der Waal bonded domain of MTPs with rich functionalities are yet to be unfurled. More of the scalable, less time-consuming synthesis protocols and the stable rational design of practical materials are anticipated. There exist still scopes for improving the metrics in the novel designs via heterostructures and doping elements, as well as the reinvention of exciting applications. Most notably, the industrial large-scale production is still underway.
