Herein, the novel Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskite Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires are grown onto PbI2 film by an in situ, seed-free solution method to build a Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction, wherein the stress-induced diffusion mechanism is proposed for its formation. Furthermore, the heterojunction is used to fabricate the low-cost, simple-structure self-powered PD, which exhibits a responsivity (R) peak of 0.17 A W−1, a specific detectivity (D*) maximum of 3.02 × 1012 Jones, and a fast response speed of 0.95 μs. These performance parameters are much better than those of a similar PD based on the pristine PbI2 film and even superior to most of PbI2-based PDs reported earlier. The greatly improved performance of the self-powered PD with the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction is largely related to the suppressed carrier recombination and enhanced carrier transportation, as a result of the enlarged built-in field (Eb) by the heterojunction. Hence, our work provides a scientific basis for exploiting high-performance PDs by combining PbI2 with novel perovskite materials.
1. Introduction
Photodetectors (PDs) that can transform light signals into electric currents have been widely used in various fields, including optical imaging, optical communication, surveillance, environmental monitoring, and other fields.1–3 The traditional PDs are generally equipped with an energy source for the detection process, which seems to limit their widespread applications.4,5 By comparison, the self-powered PDs with a simple configuration are practically free of maintenance and external power, capable of wireless operation, self-sustainable, and possess a long lifespan, which make them quite suitable to operate under harsh conditions for wireless environmental sensing, chemical sensing and biosensing, in situ medical-therapy-monitoring, and other applications.6–8 Meanwhile, self-powered PDs also potentially satisfy the growing demand for mobile, portable electronics, and integration with other multiple tasks, since they can harvest light energy directly from the environment.9,10 All of the above traits of the self-powered PDs have attracted additional research interest.
The self-powered PDs can be realized based on the photovoltaic effect, which is created by a sufficiently strong built-in electric field (Eb) that originates from a heterojunction or a Schottky contact.11–13 In this way, they can operate without an external power supply, since the Eb generates a driving force to separate photogenerated electron/hole pairs quickly and to promote the flow of the charge carriers along a single direction. Therefore, realizing the high-performance, low-cost, stable self-powered PDs involves the exploration of the heterojunction systems with strong light absorption, effective carrier separation, energetic carrier transport, easy fabrication, and reliable stability regardless of ambient conditions.
Over the past decade, lead-halide perovskites have been investigated extensively for photovoltaic cells, light-emitting diodes, and PDs.14,15 A certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 25% has been obtained for solar cells based on the lead-halide perovskites.16 Meanwhile, other optoelectronic devices based on lead-halide perovskites have also attained significant performance progress.17,18 As a necessary precursor for the synthesis of lead-halide perovskites, the achievements in optoelectronic devices based on lead halide perovskites have motivated additional interest on PbI2 for solar cells, sensors, lasers, PDs, and other advanced optoelectronic devices.19–21 In particular, the PDs made of PbI2 materials possess a low leakage current even under high bias voltage, good energy resolution, high detection efficiency, and excellent stability,20,22 benefiting from both the high resistivity and carrier mobility of PbI2. For example, Yang et al.23 demonstrated a PD based on PbI2 nanobelts, which exhibits a low dark current of 4 pA, an impressive ON/OFF ratio of 103–104, and a photoresponsivity of 13 mA W−1. By use of a monolayer graphene film as a coating layer for the surface crystallographic modification of soda-lime glass, the high-quality PbI2 films can be grown on soda-lime glass, finally enabling a prototype PD with high responsivity (∼600 on/off current ratio) and a fast response speed of 18 μs.23 Ho et al.24 reported the large-scale synthesis of high-density, freestanding PbI2 nanosheets by manipulating the microenvironment during physical vapor deposition. The resulting PD exhibits a photoresponsivity of 410 mA W−1, a detectivity of 3.1 × 1011 Jones, and a fast response with the rise time of 86 ms. These pioneering works significantly promote the developments of PbI2-based PDs. However, as far as we know, the self-powered PDs with PbI2 materials, either bulk crystals, or films, or nanomaterials, are yet to be reported, largely caused by the lack of proper material systems along with the effective preparation methods to build the PbI2-based heterojunctions.
Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskites have recently drawn ever-increasing attention for their unique characteristics of great quantum confinement effect, large exciton binding energy, and improved stability.25–27 Some more recent studies have revealed that Cs2PbI2Cl2 is an inorganic 2D perovskite with the typical RP phase.28,29 Furthermore, many appealing optoelectronic properties, including high carrier mobility, a direct bandgap, small carrier effective masses, a low exciton binding energy, and excellent ambient/thermal stability have been identified for it.28,30,31 However, Cs2PbI2Cl2 has a relatively wide bandgap of ∼3.0 eV, which seems to limit its potential applications in PDs.32 To utilize the outstanding optoelectronic features of Cs2PbI2Cl2 materials well in optoelectronic devices, there have been some studies to construct heterojunctions by combining Cs2PbI2Cl2 with other well-known semiconductors. In this way, the novel Cs2PbI2Cl2/CsPbBr3,33 Cs2PbI2Cl2/CsPbI2Br,32 Cs2PbI2Cl2/CsPbI2.5Br0.5,34 and Cs2PbI2Cl2/InSe35 heterojunctions have been explored. However, there is very limited work focused on self-powered PDs with the Cs2PbI2Cl2/PbI2 heterojunction, and thus exploring the device feasibility and special properties is worthwhile.
Herein, the RP perovskite Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction is built for the first time via a two-step solution strategy, for which the CsCl methanol solution (CsCl/MeOH) is directly spin-coated onto a solution-processed PbI2 film. The in situ, seed-free formation of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires is related to the stress-induced diffusion mechanism, wherein their length and density can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of the CsCl/MeOH solution. Such a novel heterojunction is subsequently used to fabricate the self-powered PD with the simple layer stackings of FTO/TiO2/PbI2/Cs2PbI2Cl2/Carbon. The optimized one yields a responsivity (R) peak value of 0.17 A W−1, an exceptional specific detectivity (D*) maximum of 3.02 × 1012 Jones, and a fast response speed of 0.95 μs, all of which are much better than the similar self-powered PD based on the pristine PbI2 film, with the R peak of 0.07 A W−1, D* maximum of 1.16 × 1011 Jones, and response speed of 1.52 μs. The significantly improved performance of the self-powered PD based on the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction can be assigned to the weakened carrier recombination and boosted carrier transportation as a result of the enlarged Eb within the heterojunction.
2. Results and discussion
The typical experiment procedures for the in situ, seed-free formation of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction by the two-step solution strategy are shown in Fig. 1(a). Firstly, the PbI2 film was coated onto the FTO/TiO2 substrate by spin-coating 100 μL of the PbI2 precursor at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by thermal treatment at 100 °C for 5 min. The PbI2 precursor was prepared by dissolving 461 mg of PbI2 into 1 mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at room temperature. Next, 200 μL of CsCl/MeOH solution with the concentration of 4, 6, or 8 mg mL−1 was dropped onto the PbI2 film. After loading for 30 s, the sample was spun at 3000 rpm for 30 s to swing the residual CsCl/MeOH away. Finally, it was annealed at 250 °C for 15 min to promote the crystallization of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires. At this point, the preparation of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction is fulfilled. The pristine PbI2 film was also prepared and labeled as “0 mg mL−1” for comparison.

Fig. 1(b) gives the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the pristine PbI2 film. It shows that some irregular pores are distributed randomly on its surface, consistent with the previous works.36 After deposition of 4 mg mL−1 CsCl/MeOH, plenty of Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires with the diameter of ∼150 nm and length of several microns emerge on its surface (Fig. 1(c)). However, the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires are still sparse, and some areas of the underlying layer are exposed. When the concentration of CsCl/MeOH increases to 6 mg mL−1, the resulting Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires become longer and denser, as exhibited in Fig. 1(d). Furthermore, the whole surface of the PbI2 base layer can be covered by the crisscrossed Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires. In terms of the sample produced with 8 mg mL−1 CsCl/MeOH (Fig. 1(e)), the coarsening of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires seems to happen, probably via the Ostwald ripening mechanism.37,38 Moreover, the surficial characteristics of the FTO/TiO2 substrate, which can be clearly observed from Fig. S1 (ESI†), are identified from the sample prepared with 8 mg mL−1 CsCl/MeOH. This reveals that more PbI2 species have been transformed into Cs2PbI2Cl2. The above results make clear that the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunctions can be obtained by the two-step solution strategy, wherein the microstructure characteristics of the nanowires can be regulated by adjusting the concentration of CsCl/MeOH.
To verify the successful formation of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunctions, X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests were performed on the as-studied samples. As exhibited in the right panel of Fig. 2(a), clear XRD peaks at 12.6°, 25.6°, and 38.9° were detected from the pristine PbI2 film, which are ascribed to the (001), (101), and (003) planes of crystalline PbI2, respectively.24 By comparison, the additional XRD peaks at 22.5° and 27.6° were identified for the samples with deposition of CsCl/MeOH, which are similar to those of the RP perovskite Cs2PbI2Cl2 materials reported recently, and can be indexed to the (110) and (105) planes, respectively.29,30,32 Meanwhile, one can see from the right panel of Fig. 2(a) that the (110) peaks intensify with the increased concentration of CsCl/MeOH, which indicates the formation of more Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires, consistent with the SEM results above. In addition, there is no signal corresponding to CsCl, revealing its full transformation into Cs2PbI2Cl2. The above XRD results corroborate the formation of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunctions by the two-step solution strategy again. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra in Fig. 2(b) show that the heterojunctions have absorption characteristics that are comparable to those of the pristine PbI2 film. A similar absorption onset wavelength of 515 nm can be distinguished for them, which is in line with the bandgap of the bulk PbI2 materials with the value of 2.41 eV.19,24 In contrast with the pristine PbI2 film, the absorption intensities slightly drop in sequence for the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunctions with the improved concentration of CsCl/MeOH, which can be assigned to the fact that some PbI2 species are converted into Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires. However, the absorption features of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires were not found in the absorption spectra. Such a phenomenon can be ascribed to the fact that Cs2PbI2Cl2 has a bandgap of 2.95 eV and an absorption onset of 420 nm.29 Thus, its absorption traits are overlapped with those of PbI2 in the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction. In addition, the surficial composition of the pristine PbI2 film and the typical Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 2(c–f) and Fig. S2 (ESI†), the obvious signals of Pb 4f and I 3d were detected from both two samples, while the additional peaks of Cs 3d and Cl 2p can be found from the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction. These results are in accordance with the fact that the heterojunction is composed of Cs2PbI2Cl2 and PbI2.

Furthermore, the microstructure characteristics of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires were investigated in depth by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) equipped with selective area electron diffraction (SAED) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). As seen from Fig. 3(a and b), the nanowire has a smooth surface and a uniform profile with the average diameter of ∼150 nm. Moreover, there is no detectable grain boundary, indicating its single-crystalline nature. This is also consistent with the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) result in Fig. 3(c), wherein the continuous lattice fringes with the interplanar spacing of 0.399 nm are visibly observed across the nanowire body, providing additional evidence for the crystallinity and the preferential [110] growth characteristic of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowire. The corresponding SAED pattern in Fig. 3(d) presents the sharp diffraction spots, revealing the high crystallinity and monocrystalline character of the nanowire again. The elemental mapping results in Fig. 3(e) disclose the uniform elemental distribution of Cs, Pb, I, and Cl of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowire, which has a composition ratio of approximately 2:1:2:2 (Fig. S3, ESI†), agreeing with the stoichiometric ratio of Cs2PbI2Cl2.

Furthermore, a possible mechanism for the formation of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction is proposed based on the stress-induced migration model.39,40 As illustrated in Fig. 4(a), when the CsCl/MeOH was loaded onto the PbI2 film, a Cs2PbI2Cl2 thin layer can be formed via the following reaction:41 PbI2 + 2CsCl → Cs2PbI2Cl2(1)Since the molar volume of Cs2PbI2Cl2 is much larger than that of PbI2, the compressive stress near the Cs2PbI2Cl2/PbI2 interface and the stress gradient between the top (Cs2PbI2Cl2 side) and bottom (FTO/TiO2 side) faces of the PbI2 film were generated. The atomic flux that is caused by the stress-induced migration can be described as:42 (2)where J is the flux of the diffusion species, C is the atomic concentration, Ω is the atomic volume, kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature, D is the local diffusion coefficient, and σ is the hydrostatic stress (average normal stress). Thus, the gradient of hydrostatic stress can serve as the driving force for atomic diffusion, and the atomic flux is in the direction from more compressive/less tensile area to less compressive/more tensile area. Herein, in the early stage of the loading procedure, the surface diffusion of the Pb–I atoms near the Cs2PbI2Cl2/PbI2 interface proceeded by the stress concentration, which occurred at the grain boundaries due to material singularities.43,44 When the Pb–I atoms arrived at the sample surface, they continued to migrate to some specific sites through surface diffusion. If the diffusion rate was high enough and the accumulation of the Pb–I atoms attained a critical value at the Cs2PbI2Cl2/PbI2 interface, the nanowires were nucleated via any weak spots of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 thin layer. Furthermore, the migrating Pb–I atoms served as the continuous source for the formation of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires. The growth of the nanowires relieved parts of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 thin layer that suffered compressive stress from PbI2 on its bottom surface. The above proposed growth processes of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires are well supported by the SEM images of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction samples with the loading of 6 mg mL−1 CsCl/MeOH at the different growth stages controlled by the loading time of CsCl/MeOH, as exhibited in Fig. 4(b–g).

(b–g) SEM images of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction samples with the loading of 6 mg mL−1 CsCl/MeOH for different durations of (b) 2 s, (c) 5 s, (d) 10 s, (e) 15 s, (f) 20 s, and (g) 25 s. 
Next, the as-obtained Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunctions were used to build the PDs with the simple device structure of FTO/TiO2/PbI2/Cs2PbI2Cl2/carbon, as schematically shown in Fig. 5(a). It should be noted that all of the functional layers of the PDs can be obtained by use of solution methods and cheap raw materials. Thus, they are endowed with many appealing traits of low cost, facile fabrication, ease of scaling, and others.45,46Fig. 5(b) presents the dark current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the PDs based on the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunctions formed with 4, 6, and 8 mg mL−1 CsCl/MeOH and pristine PbI2 film. The asymmetric J–V characteristic can be identified for all as-studied PDs, which reveal their rectifying behavior, and thus the formation of Ebs in them.47–49 By comparison, the rectifying behavior is more obvious for the PDs fabricated with 6 and 8 mg mL−1 CsCl/MeOH, as indicated by Fig. S4 (ESI†). Moreover, the PDs fabricated with the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunctions possess the lower dark current densities under the bias voltages from −0.5 to 1 V, particularly for the one obtained with 6 mg mL−1 CsCl/MeOH. For instance, under the bias voltage of −0.5 V, the PD based on the pristine PbI2 film displays a dark current density of 2.13 × 10−4 A cm−2, while the value decreases to 1.04 × 10−5 A cm−2 for the one obtained with 6 mg mL−1 CsCl/MeOH. Moreover, the dark current density minimum diminishes from 9.64 × 10−6 to 1.03 × 10−8 A cm−2 for it. A low dark current usually makes for a small shot noise and always together with a low thermal value, which are conducive to realizing high-sensitivity PDs.47,49

(g) TPC curves and (h) response properties to a 405 nm on/off modulated laser in a test period of 4 h for the self-powered PDs based on the pristine PbI2 film and Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction prepared with 6 mg mL−1 CsCl/MeOH. 

Fig. 5(c) offers the light J–V curves of the as-studied PDs measured under continuous xenon lamp illumination with the intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The formation of photovoltages for all PDs discloses their self-powered functionality.6,48,49 To be specific, the open-circuit voltage is estimated to be 0.590 V for the PD fabricated with the PbI2 film, while the values increase to 0.656, 0.639, and 0.653 V for the PDs prepared with 4, 6, and 8 mg mL−1 CsCl/MeOH, respectively. Meanwhile, one can see that the light current densities for the PDs fabricated with 4, 6, and 8 mg mL−1 CsCl/MeOH are larger than the one based on the pristine PbI2 film, revealing their better photoelectric conversion capacity.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the as-fabricated PDs are given in Fig. 5(d), which were recorded without any bias voltage. The clear photoresponse can be observed for all of the PDs, verifying their self-powered functionality again. Meanwhile, the PDs show a similar photocurrent onset wavelength of around 515 nm, which indicates that the PbI2 component dominates the photoelectric conversion of all of the as-fabricated PDs. However, the much higher EQEs can be obtained for the PDs based on the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunctions. For instance, the EQEs of the PD prepared with 6 mg mL−1 CsCl/MeOH are more than twice that of the one based on the pristine PbI2 film, wherein its EQE peak is as high as 51%.
The above light J–V and EQE results corroborate that the self-powered functionality was realized successfully for the PDs based on either pristine PbI2 films or Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunctions. However, if the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunctions are employed, the significantly improved photoelectric conversion properties can be realized for the self-powered PDs. To further clarify the performance of the as-fabricated PDs, their responsivity (R) and specific detectivity (D*) were evaluated, which are provided in Fig. 4(e and f). They exhibit the similar photo-response wavelength range from 300 to 515 nm, in accordance with the absorption properties of PbI2. Moreover, an obvious fact can be derived that the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunctions can substantially boost the performance of the self-powered PDs. To be specific, by optimizing the concentration of CsCl/MeOH to be 6 mg mL−1, the R peak improves greatly from 0.07 to 0.17 A W−1, and the D* maximum advances significantly from 1.16 × 1011 to 3.02 × 1012 Jones. As far as we know, this is the first report of a self-powered PD using PbI2 as the absorber layer, and the D* value achieved for the optimized one is beyond most of the PbI2-based PDs reported previously, as indicated by Table 1.

The response speed of the typical PDs was studied by use of a transient photocurrent (TPC) measurement system, by referring to the measurement recipes reported in recent works.47,57Fig. 5(g) presents the transient photocurrent (TPC) curves under the bias of 0 V for the self-powered PDs based on the PbI2 film and Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction formed with 6 mg mL−1 CsCl/MeOH. The response time can be obtained by fitting the curves with a single-exponential decay function. The self-powered PD based on the PbI2 film exhibits a response time of 1.52 μs, while it was markedly shortened to 0.95 μs for the one built with the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction formed with 6 mg mL−1 CsCl/MeOH. Again, one can see from Table 1 that the response speed of our optimized self-powered PD is the highest level achieved for PbI2-based PDs until now.
Furthermore, the operational reliabilities of the two self-powered PDs were compared by monitoring their response properties to a 405 nm on/off modulated laser in ambient air atmosphere with a relative humidity (RH) of 40–50% and a temperature of 30 °C. As displayed in Fig. 5(f), the dark current and photocurrent are both quite stable over the whole test period of 4 h. These results manifest that the innovative use of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires for the PbI2-based PDs does not degrade their reliability, which is largely ascribed to the fact that the RP perovskite Cs2PbI2Cl2 materials possess excellent stability.
Finally, the carrier dynamics in the self-powered PDs based on the pristine PbI2 film and Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction were studied to better comprehend the superior performance of the latter. Fig. 6(a) gives their Nyquist plots derived from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results recorded under a bias voltage of 1 V and dark condition. The arcs are generally accepted to be related to the recombination behavior of the photo-generated carriers, characterized by the recombination resistance (Rrec).49,58,59 By fitting the Nyquist plots with the equivalent circuit model in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the Rrec values are estimated to be 4070 and 8411 Ω for the self-powered PDs based on the pristine PbI2 film and Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction, revealing the weaker carrier recombination of the latter. Meanwhile, the junction characteristics in the as-concerned PDs were studied by Mott–Schottky (M–S) tests.59 The resulting C−2–V plots along with the fitting results are provided in Fig. 6(b), from which the Vbi values were determined to be 1.48 and 1.67 V for the self-powered PDs fabricated with pristine PbI2 film and Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction, respectively. Namely, the use of Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires can effectively enlarge the Eb of the resulting self-powered PD. A large Eb is conducive to boosting the extraction and separation of charge carriers and thus reduces their non-radiative recombination, which benefits the improved R and D* of the corresponding PDs. Furthermore, the energy band structures of the PbI2 film and Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires were investigated by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and the results are shown in Fig. 6(c).58 The work function values were evaluated to be 3.81 and 4.01 eV for the PbI2 film and Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires, respectively, by subtracting the UPS photoemission cut-off energy boundary (Ecutoff) from 21.22 eV. On the other hand, the valence band maximum (VBM) values were calculated to be −6.47 and −5.86 eV for the PbI2 film and Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires, respectively, according to VBM = −[21.22 − [Ecutoff − Eonset]], where Eonset represents the UPS photoemission onset energy. By taking the bandgaps of PbI2 and Cs2PbI2Cl2 to be 2.41 and 2.95 eV, respectively, their conduction band maxima (CBMs) were assessed to be −3.91 and −2.91 eV, respectively. Based on these values, the energy band structure of the self-powered PD fabricated with the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction was established, as illustrated in Fig. 6(d). One can see that the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires can promote the transport of photo-generated holes from PbI2 to the carbon electrode, while blocking the recombination of photo-generated elections in PbI2 with holes in the carbon electrode,58,59 accounting for the better performance of the self-powered PD with Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction.

3. Conclusions
The novel RP perovskite Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires were grown successfully onto a PbI2 film by an in situ, seed-free solution method for the first time, leading to the formation of a Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction. It was shown that the growth of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires is related to the stress-induced diffusion mechanism, wherein their length and density can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of the CsCl/MeOH solution. The low-cost, simple-structure self-powered PDs based on the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunctions exhibit an optimized R of 0.17 A W−1, maximum D* of 3.02 × 1012 Jones, and fast response speed of 0.95 μs, which are much better than a similar one fabricated with pristine PbI2 film and even beyond most of the PbI2-based PDs reported previously. The excellent performance of the self-powered PDs with Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunctions can be mainly ascribed to the improved carrier dynamics, as a result of the enlarged built-in field (Eb) by the heterojunction.
4. Experimental section
Materials
All of the chemicals and reagents were used without any further purification, including ultra-dry PbI2 (≥99.998%, Alfa-Aesar), ultra-dry CsCl (≥99.5%, Alfa-Aesar), anhydrous DMSO (≥99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), absolute MeOH (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), conductive carbon paste (Shanghai MaterWin New Materials Co., Ltd), and FTO glass (8 Ω sq−1, Pilkington TEC Glass).
Preparation of the FTO/TiO2 substrates
FTO glass sheets with a size of 2 × 2.5 cm2 were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and ethanol for 30 min, consecutively. After being dried by a stream of nitrogen air, a 60 nm TiO2 layer was coated by the spin-coating of 100 μL TiO2 sol at 3000 rpm for 30 s and further thermal annealing at 500 °C for 60 min in air. After cooling down to room temperature naturally, the FTO/TiO2 substrates were obtained for further use.
Preparation of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction
Firstly, the PbI2 precursor was prepared by dissolving 461 mg PbI2 into DMSO at 70 °C with vigorous stirring. Then, 100 μL of the PbI2 precursor was spin-coated onto the as-obtained FTO/TiO2 substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s, which was followed by thermal treatment at 100 °C for 5 min. At this point, the pristine PbI2 film was obtained. Next, 200 μL MeOH solution containing 4, 6, or 8 mg mL−1 CsCl was dropped onto the parent PbI2 film. After loading for a constant time of 30 s, the sample was spun at 3000 rpm for 30 s to remove the residual CsCl/MeOH. Finally, it was annealed at 250 °C for 15 min to fulfill the crystallization of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires and thus the formation of the Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction.
Fabrication of self-powered PDs
A carbon back-electrode with the active area of 0.09 cm2 was coated onto the as-prepared PbI2 or Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanowires/PbI2 heterojunction sample by screen-printing the conductive carbon paste at room temperature. After that, the whole device was baked at 120 °C for 15 min to fulfill the PD fabrication.
Characterizations
SEM images were obtained by high-resolution SEM (JEOL-7100F). XRD patterns were tested using a Bruker D8 Advance powder X-ray diffractometer and Cu Kα radiation (1.5406 Å). UV-vis absorption spectra were measured by a PerkinElmer spectrophotometer (Lambda 950). TEM characterizations were carried out using a JEOL 2100F TEM equipped with an EDX spectrometer and SAED. J–V curves were measured using a Keithley 2636 source meter. EQE spectra were collected using a Zolix DSR-101-UV system equipped with Si PD as reference. The R curves of the PDs can be obtained using the following formula:47,48, where λ is the wavelength, h is the Planck constant, c is the light speed, and e is the elementary charge. D* spectra can be calculated using the following equation:47,48, where A is the device working area, e is the elementary charge and Id is the measured minimum dark current. The TPC curves were recorded using a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix, MSO5204B) with an input resistance of 50 Ω, where the device was illuminated with a 520 nm pulse laser (MDL-NS-520). The long-term response properties of the PDs were recorded using a Keithley 2450 source meter, during which the devices were illuminated with a 405 nm CW laser (MDL-III-405) modulated by a square signal (100 mHz, 10 s) generated by an arbitrary function generator (Tektronix, AFG3051C). EIS results were tested by an electrochemical workstation (CHI600E, Shanghai Chenhua) in the frequency range of 102–106 Hz with the amplitude of 10 mV and the bias voltage of 1 V. M–S plots were recorded on the same system under an AC excitation amplitude of 30 mV at a frequency of 5 kHz.
