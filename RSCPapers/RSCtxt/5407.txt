    , Accepted 12th March 2019First published on 12th March 2019AbstractThe π–π stacking of terminal electron-deficient groups is known to support the main charge transport pathway in acceptor–donor–acceptor type fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs). Interactions between terminal groups influence molecular stacking and ultimate photovoltaic performances. Herein, we designed two novel asymmetric FREAs bearing different polar terminal groups via a facile stepwise Knoevenagel condensation. The combination of two terminal groups with differing polarities in a single molecule fine-tuned the absorption and energy levels. Furthermore, the different terminal groups induced a permanent dipole moment over the whole molecule with regional dipole moments at the end regions. These effects enabled control over intermolecular interactions, crystallization properties, and the blended microscopic morphology. Single-junction solar cells based on the asymmetric a-IT-2OM in combination with the widely used polymer donor PBDB-T yielded power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) as high as 12.07%, which represents a 30%-increase compared with that of the control device. Notably, devices based on PBDB-T/a-IT-2OM retained high PCEs greater than 11% for active layer thicknesses up to 200 nm; PCEs of approximately 9% were maintained even at a thickness of 450 nm. These findings offer a route to high performance FREA molecules for thick-film solar cell devices and also provide a novel asymmetric molecular design strategy.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) show great promise for applications in energy conversion devices owing to their mechanical flexibility, light weight, low-cost, and solution processability. Fullerene-based solar cells have dominated this field for a long period owing to their strong electron affinity, high electron mobility, and isotropic charge transport properties of fullerene derivatives. Recently, fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) have been developed as alternatives to fullerene derivatives, introducing new opportunities for development in the field of OSCs.1–5 Considerable efforts have been devoted to developing novel FREAs, which provide tunable energy levels,6 adjustable light absorption over different wavelengths,3,7 and controllable aggregation properties.2,8,9 These features enable much greater flexibility in molecular design than that for fullerene derivatives.
As a representative FREA, ITIC contains an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type molecular skeleton, which was first tested in devices by Zhan et al.10 and reported to have power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) comparable or better than those of fullerene-based OSCs devices. Generally, A segments are 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) or its derivatives,6,9,11 whereas ladder-type aromatic fused-rings, such as indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT),12–15 dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDTT)4,6,16,17 are commonly used D moieties. Many derivatives have been developed based on central D moieties by changing the central core,18,19 extending the conjugation length,11,20–24 varying the lateral chains,16,17,25,26 altering the bridging units,7,27 and inserting electron donating atoms.2,3,28 These investigations have rapidly improved the device performance and PCEs of more than 13% have been achieved for single junction nonfullerene acceptor based OSCs.16,29–31 Furthermore, the π–π stacking of terminal IC groups is now recognized to be the main charge transport channel for A–D–A type FREAs.27,32,33 Sterically hindered side chains have been incorporated into the central donor core to prevent the acceptor molecules from forming H-type aggregations. However, only well-matched polymer/FREA pairs achieve optimal photovoltaic performance. Newly developed FREAs are not always compatible with existing polymers. To improve the matching between the donor and acceptor, efforts have been devoted to tuning the energy level, light-harvesting ability, and crystallization properties of donor polymers.4,15,16,29,31,34,35 However, apparently simple molecular modifications can greatly influence the synthetic complexity. For example, Hou et al. incorporated four fluorine atoms into the terminal IC groups of IT-4F. The LUMO energy level of this molecule was not compatible with the HOMO of the widely used poly[2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)-co-(1,3-bis(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T); hence, they tailor-made fluorine and sulfur modified PBDB-T-SF to ensure optimization.4 Heeney et al. replaced the relatively bulky side chains of ITIC with simple linear alkyl chains to improve the packing ability and charge transport mobility of ITIC-C8; however, they also had to prepare a derivative of the polymer PFBDB-T with compatible energy levels for device fabrication. Their investigations on modifying the alkyl side chains of IDTT illustrate that the conceptual simple design approach presents many synthetic challenges.16 Nevertheless, these methods of introducing synthetic complexity into polymer donors and small molecule acceptors have the potential to drive PCEs to more than 13%.
Intermolecular dipole–dipole interactions between non-centrosymmetric D–π–A type molecules drive neighboring molecules to form centrosymmetric dye aggregates, particularly when the chromophore possesses a large dipole-moment (μ).36 However, in the field of non-fullerene organic solar cells, most A–D–A type acceptors possess a nonpolar centrosymmetric character and regional dipole moments at A–D segments, which counteract each other, as has been observed in electro-optical (EO) studies. Although stronger inter-chromophore dipolar interactions are not favored for poling in EO studies,37 complex supramolecular architectures have been detected, formed by dipole-driven self-assembly. These effects might be effectively used in the molecular design of FREAs to tune intermolecular aggregation. On the basis of the above considerations, a ground state dipole-moment might be realized through the asymmetric molecular design; however, there have been few studies of asymmetric FREAs or their applications in OSCs. We previously reported a new IDT-based FREA with asymmetric side chains, which led to symmetry breaking and induced a small dipole moment over the whole molecule.12 This structure reduced crystallinity of the film without sacrificing close molecular contact. Recently, Yang et al. developed a new asymmetric donor core, which combined IDT and IDTT, to achieve a high fill factor of 77%.38 However, the introduction of asymmetric characteristics into the ladder core increased the cost and complexity of the synthesis. Thus, herein we developed an approach to add a dipole moment to an FREA skeleton through a simple attachment of terminal groups with different polarities. This idea is based on the following considerations: (i) varied terminal IC groups incorporated into one FREA molecule (A1–D–A2) generate a permanent dipole moment over the whole molecule, which reinforces intermolecular interactions and results in a tendency for more varied aggregation rather than interactions with adjacent molecules (ii) site-isolation from the bulky side chains (e.g., hexylphenyl groups) at the D core takes effect when adjacent molecules become too close. Additionally, the different local dipole moments of the A1–D or D–A2 segments tune the crystallization, aggregation morphologies, and charge transport characteristics; (iii) the asymmetric A1–D–A2 strategy might enable fine tuning of energy levels; (iv) a facile and cost-effective one-pot stepwise Knoevenagel condensation can be used to synthesize asymmetric A1–D–A2 type FREA.
For our first trial we selected ITIC as the prototype molecule, which enabled control experiments to evaluate the effects of our asymmetric molecular strategy. Many groups have achieved impressive PCEs based on this acceptor. We used three different types of IC groups, namely, IC, 2F-IC, and 2OM-IC, and two asymmetric FREAs (a-IT-2OM and a-IT-2F) were designed based on the IDTT core. We used density functional theory (DFT) quantum calculations to predict the ground state dipole moments (μ) to be 3.28 D and 3.07 D for a-IT-2F and a-IT-2OM, respectively. Conversely, μ for ITIC was 0.0 D. We selected PBDB-T as the donor polymer because it has been paired with ITIC in many studies and established a baseline in our control devices. Owing to the improved molecular dipole interactions and tuned energy levels, we achieved PCEs of 10.28% and 12.07% for a-IT-2F and a-IT-2OM, respectively. The PCE of 12.07% represented a 30% improvement compared with the best PCE obtained for our ITIC-based control devices. The variations of local dipole moments in each molecule were also evaluated and these results demonstrated that the dipole direction and intensity influenced the final molecular packing and charge transport properties, which were consistent with our grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and space charge limited current (SCLC) characterization results. Importantly, with suitable terminal group combination, a-IT-2OM not only displayed favorable face-on orientation and more balanced charge transport behavior but its devices had a PCE of 10.97% at an active layer thickness of 190 nm. Even when the thickness of the active layer was increased to 450 nm, a PCE of 8.81% was achieved. This insensitivity to active layer thickness is a promising feature for future practical applications.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
As shown in Scheme 1, we used a simple stepwise Knoevenagel condensation to synthesize a-IT-2F and a-IT-2OM. Starting from the commercially available IDTT core, IC and 2F-IC (or 2OM-IC) were added to the reaction mixture subsequently over 12 h. The target molecules a-IT-2F and a-IT-2OM (as shown in Fig. 1a) were obtained in yields of 39% and 54%, respectively. These two new acceptors were readily soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, and tetrahydrofuran. We confirmed their chemical structures by high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), 1H and 13C NMR.

Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The solution and thin film UV-Vis absorption spectra of ITIC, a-IT-2OM, a-IT-2F and the polymer donor PBDB-T are shown in Fig. 1. These ITIC-based FREAs shared similar features in their absorption spectra in both solutions and thin films. Notably, the introduction of electron withdrawing and donating groups at the IC component induced red and blue shifts relative to ITIC for a-IT-2F and a-IT-2OM, respectively. On changing from solution to thin films, the absorption maximum featured a remarkable red-shift of approximately 30 nm, the main absorption band became broader, and the electronic vibration shoulder peaks intensified. These features suggest the existence of intermolecular π–π stacking in the neat films. The optical bandgaps of the asymmetric FREAs were approximately 1.60 eV. The complementary absorption with PBDB-T, shown in Fig. 1c, suggested that the system might be an effective donor/acceptor pair for an active layer. We determined the energy levels of these acceptors by an electrochemical method. Detailed optical and electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1. Notably, our asymmetric strategy enabled fine tuning of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is directly related to the Voc of the final OSC devices. The methoxy group up-shifted the LUMO level to be −3.92 eV for a-IT-2OM compared with that of ITIC (LUMO = −4.02 eV); conversely, fluorine modification down-shifted the LUMO to be −4.07 eV for a-IT-2F, as shown in Fig. 1e and Table 1.

Quantum calculations
To gain an understanding of the molecular level differences induced by the asymmetric character of these FREA molecules, we applied DFT calculations. First, we optimized the molecular geometry of the two asymmetric FREAs by DFT at the ωB97XD/6-31G(d,p) level and the alkyl chains were replaced by a methyl group to simplify the calculations. These results indicated that the two asymmetric acceptors possessed planar structures and permanent dipole moments (μ) of 3.28 D and 3.07 D for a-IT-2F and a-IT-2OM, respectively; conversely, ITIC had a rather weak dipole of 0.0 D. As illustrated in Fig. 2a–b, the orientation of the natural dipole moment for both the asymmetric FREA molecules was located in the same plane as the conjugated backbone. However, the differing polarities at the terminal region (regional dipole moments, as shown in Fig. 2c) influenced the permanent dipole moment of the final molecules. Higher polarity values of 5.42 D and 5.36 D were observed for the fluorine- and methoxy-modified segments, respectively. Notably, methoxy substitution tuned the dipole moment to be almost parallel along the y-axis for Th-2OM-IC with a small angle of 6° (Fig. 2c). This alignment might favor terminal stacking without any hindrance from the bulky side chains at the donor core. However, fluorine substitution had the opposite effect and increased the angle from 30° (Th-IC) to 47° (Th-2F-IC), as shown in Fig. 2c. This effect might impede terminal stacking. The permanent dipole moment is the sum of all the regional dipole moments. With different combinations of the terminal IC groups, the dipole moment for a-IT-2F was angled at 26° to the long axis (x direction); however, a-IT-2OM showed a smaller angle of 17°, which was more consistent with the long axis orientation. Such inherent dipole moments might be expected to favor side-by-side interactions of two molecules; however, neither molecule formed such aggregates. The antiparallel stacking arrangement of the terminal groups was reinforced owing to the terminal regional dipole and steric hindrance caused by the side chain located at the conjugated ladder core (i.e., the IDTT part).

Local π–π stacking between terminal acceptor units of FREAs has been well studied,27,32,33 and two types of end-capping IC groups in each molecule produce three possible stacking combinations for terminal groups. We used DFT to calculate the optimized molecular geometries of dimers at the ωB97XD/6-31G(d,p) level. The corresponding intermolecular binding energies were calculated by correction of the basis set superposition error (BSSE) according to the literature method,39 as shown in Fig. 2d and e. IC units had very similar binding energies of approximately −27.2 kcal mol−1 in both bimolecular systems for a-IT-2F or a-IT-2OM; however, we observed distinct behaviors for the binding combination of the 2F-IC and 2OM-IC terminals. Fluorine modification at the terminal acceptor units appeared to slightly reduce the binding interactions; however, methoxy groups had the opposite effect i.e., the bimolecular binding energy improved. Notably, the homo-interaction of 2OM-IC featured much stronger intermolecular interactions with a binding energy of approximately −34.3 kcal mol−1. The binding energies in this study are consistent with the dipole discussion and the results demonstrate that finely tuning the terminal acceptor units can effectively regulate the local intermolecular π–π interactions. Thus, this approach might be an effective way to adjust molecular aggregation in blended films, which may influence the electron mobilities and impact the eventual photovoltaic performance.
Photovoltaic properties and SCLC mobilities
To explore the applicability of this material design method, we used PBDB-T for a general comparison and fabricated inverted devices with a configuration of ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/active layer/MoO3 (8.5 nm)/Ag (100 nm). The J–V curves and corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) results of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 3 and the key parameters are summarized in Table 2. The optimal ratio of the PBDB-T:acceptor was 1:1 for both the asymmetric FREAs. We measured PCEs of 9.10% and 11.04% for the as-cast blend films of a-IT-2F and a-IT-2OM, respectively; however, the corresponding PCE for the ITIC device was approximately 9.53%. The apparent influence of the substituent groups on the Voc is consistent with the changing trend of the LUMO levels i.e., methoxy group substitution in a-IT-2OM shifted the Voc to be higher and fluorine substitution in a-IT-2F had the opposite effect. In addition, these results imply that asymmetric molecular configurations have positive effects on the FF enhancement relative to the symmetric ITIC (from ∼63% to ∼70%). We further optimized these devices with the addition of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), as shown in Table S1.† DIO (0.2%, v%) appeared to be the most suitable additive for both asymmetric acceptors and PCEs of approximately 10.28% and 12.07% were achieved in the treated a-IT-2F and a-IT-2OM devices, respectively. A PCE of 12% is one of the highest values for an ITIC-based fullerene-free PSC with PBDB-T as the donor. The EQE spectra of the optimized a-IT-2F and a-IT-2OM based devices are shown in Fig. 3. The devices showed a strong photo-response in the range from 300 to 800 nm, which is consistent with the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the corresponding components. Both acceptors featured flat-roofed EQE curves with intensities over 70% and a maxima reaching 80%, indicating efficient photon harvesting and charge collection. The red-shifted spectrum of a-IT-2F had a broad EQE curve, which extended to 850 nm and resulted in a high Jsc of 18.55 mA cm−2. In addition, all the Jsc values were corrected by integrating the EQE curves with an AM1.5 G reference spectrum. These calculations were in good agreement with the observed Jsc values in the J–V measurements (mismatch within 5%).

We investigated the bimolecular recombination in the optimized devices based on a-IT-2OM and a-IT-2F by measuring Jsc under different light intensities (Plight) and fitting the data to the power law: Jsc ∝ Plightα, where the values of α provides information about the bimolecular charge recombination. The exponents α for a-IT-2F and a-IT-2OM series-based cells were 0.93 and 0.97, respectively, indicating that weak bimolecular recombination occurred in the blended films and a-IT-2OM:PBDB-T had a higher dissociation probability and charge collection ability, which explained its higher FF value. In addition, we measured the photocurrent density (Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD stand for the current densities under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 and in the dark, respectively) versus the effective voltage (Veff = V0 − Vapp, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Vapp is the applied voltage). Under short-circuit conditions, exciton dissociation and charge recombination probabilities (Pdiss = Jph/Jsat, where Jsat represents the saturation photocurrent density) of 93.5% and 96.1% were achieved in the optimized devices based on a-IT-2F and a-IT-2OM, respectively. These results indicate efficient exciton separation and effective charge transport and collection occurred in both blend films based on the asymmetric acceptors, which may be ascribed to the efficient charge transport channels provided by the dipole induced terminal stacking. Of the two asymmetric acceptors, a-IT-2OM showed greater promise in the nonfullerene acceptor:PBDB-T blend system.
We also used the SCLC method to measure the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of the blend films in typical device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:acceptor/Au and ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:acceptor/Al, respectively (Fig. S8 and Table S4†). We estimated the hole μh mobilities of PBDB-T:a-IT-2F and PBDB-T:a-IT-2OM based devices to be 7.99 × 10−5 and 6.61 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively; the values of μe were calculated to be 3.95 × 10−5 and 3.89 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The PBDB-T:a-IT-2OM blended films had a balanced μh/μe ratio of 1.69, which promotes efficient transport of photo-generated charge carriers to electrodes and is desirable for high performance devices. Conversely, the relatively large μh/μe ratio of 2.03 for the PBDB-T:a-IT-2F blend films suggests that the charge accumulates in the blend system.
Morphological properties
Photovoltaic performance is markedly affected by the morphology of the active blend layers; thus, we investigated the morphological characteristics of the optimized blend layers by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 4, both blended films based on the two asymmetric acceptors had smooth surfaces with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of approximately 1.5–2.3 nm with and without the additive. These features account for the relatively high Jsc and FF values. In addition, PBDB-T nanofibers and interpenetrating networks were clearly observed in both the blended films, with and without the DIO additive. Thus, DIO has a small influence on the surface morphology in the a-IT-2F:PBDB-T blend systems (Fig. 4a and b). In addition to the fibrillar nanowires detected in the pristine a-IT-2OM:PBDB-T blend films, we also observed large aggregated flakes of a-IT-2OM mingled with the PBDB-T fibers (Fig. 4c). For the 0.2%-DIO used in the a-IT-2OM:PBDB-T blend solution, the morphology was effectively tuned and fibrillar networks became clearer, as shown in Fig. 4d. The morphology differences indicated various aggregation properties of these asymmetric acceptors, which we attributed to the diverse range of intermolecular dipole interactions as discussed in the bimolecular binding energy study (vide supra). The results once again demonstrated that a-IT-2OM possessed a stronger intermolecular affinity. We used TEM to provide in-depth information on the blend films, which were consistent with our AFM results. For the a-IT-2F:PBDB-T blend films, the PBDB-T fibers were distributed all over the substrate regardless of whether DIO was used or not. Sheet-like aggregates (likely formed by a-IT-2OM) co-existed with a smaller amount of fibrillar PBDB-T in the pristine PBDB-T:a-IT-2OM blend film. Aggregation of a-IT-2OM was effectively suppressed by addition of 0.2% DIO, as shown in Fig. 4h.

GIWAXS characterization
To gain insight into the influence of the terminal groups on the molecular stacking characteristics (i.e., the orientation of the crystalline regions with respect to electrodes and the molecular arrangements), we used GIWAXS characterization to analyze the neat acceptor films and the blend films with PBDB-T. As shown in Fig. 5b and c, GIWAXS results of the neat a-IT-2F and a-IT-2OM films showed quite different scattering patterns. Amorphous characteristics were observed in the neat a-IT-2F film similar to those of ITIC (Fig. 5a); whereas, the a-IT-2OM neat film presented a distinct face-on orientation with a π–π stacking (010) diffraction peak at 1.75 Å−1 (d-spacing of 3.6 Å) in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, and a (100) lamellar diffraction peak at 0.34 Å−1 (interlamellar distance of 18.7 Å) in the in-plane (IP) direction, which may be beneficial from the terminal y-axis-paralleled dipoles in a-IT-2OM (vide supra). These observations further confirmed that the asymmetric a-IT-2OM has a stronger molecular affinity. When blended with PBDB-T, intense (010) peaks in the OOP direction and distinct (100) peaks in the IP direction were observed. These results indicate that the molecular backbones in the blended systems are inclined to present a face-on orientation to the substrate. This arrangement is desirable for achieving high charge carrier mobility and higher photovoltaic efficiencies.

Thick film device application
To meet the practical application requirements of PSCs, thickness sensitivity of the active layer is an important parameter affecting large-scale production. Thick-film tolerance is advantageous for reducing active layer defects during solution processing. Our PBDB-T:a-IT-2OM-based PSCs achieved an excellent PCE of 12%; hence, herein we systematically evaluated the thickness-performance relationship of this blend system (Fig. 6). The Voc values were insensitive to film thickness from 100 to 450 nm. The values of Jsc slightly fluctuated at approximately 18 mA cm−2 as the thickness was varied, which indicated that efficient charge carrier transport channels were formed via the strong dipole-induced terminal stacking. Conversely, the FF values exhibited clear thickness-dependent behavior. The FF value remained above 65% when the thickness was below 200 nm and started to decrease in the region of 200–300 nm, remaining at approximately 55% above 300 nm. Consequently, the best PCE was obtained for a thickness of 105 nm, which represents a tradeoff of all these parameters. Remarkably, devices based on PBDB-T:a-IT-2OM retained PCEs above 11% for active layer thicknesses up to 200 nm. Furthermore, PCEs of approximately 9% were maintained even for a thickness of 450 nm; thus, these asymmetric acceptors show great promise for practical applications.

Conclusion
In summary, we developed a simple synthesis of asymmetric FREAs by combining different polar terminal acceptor units. This asymmetric strategy enabled fine tuning of the molecular absorption and energy levels and also generated a permanent molecular dipole moment, which enhanced intermolecular interactions compared with widely used symmetric ITIC. In addition, the differing intensities and orientations of the terminal dipoles enabled effective tuning of the molecular binding energy, crystallization properties, and microscopic morphology of the blend films. Consequently, devices based on the asymmetric acceptors (a-IT-2F and a-IT-2OM) achieved high PCEs of 10.28% and 12.07%, respectively. These performances were higher than that of a symmetric ITIC-based device. In addition, introduction of two methoxy groups at one terminal IC unit could produce y-axis-paralleled terminal dipoles and strengthen the bimolecular binding, as confirmed by quantum chemical calculations and GIWAXS results. Importantly, stronger intermolecular interactions were driven by the overall permanent molecular and local terminal group dipole moments for a-IT-2OM, which promoted close molecular packing and efficient charge transport. These effects resulted in high photovoltaic performance even in devices with thick films (PCE of ∼11% at ∼200 nm; PCE of ∼9% at ∼450 nm). In this contribution, we report high-performance FREA molecules for thick-film nonfullerene acceptor-based solar cell devices and provide a novel asymmetric strategy for designing non-fullerene acceptor molecules that have high performance in devices.
