    , Accepted 2nd May 2014First published on 6th May 2014AbstractFour new tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)-based dyes featured with a donor–bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) structure were synthesized and characterized. All of them undergo two reversible oxidations to form stable radical cation and dication species. The electronic interactions between the TTF donor and the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor through the different π-linkers have been demonstrated by the presence of a photo-induced intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) absorption band in the visible region. A red shift of the ICT state can be finely tuned by the degree of aromaticity and extended conjugation of π-bridges. To some extent, the oxidation potentials of these dyes are affected by the nature of π-bridges. They have been applied in organic dye-sensitized solar cells, showing relatively low power conversion efficiencies of up to 0.87% due to substantial charge recombination losses.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) represent one of the most important means for the conversion of solar radiation to electricity.1,2 The chemical nature and structure of a sensitizer play a crucial role in the development of high efficiency DSSCs. Since the last two decades, polypyridyl transition metal complexes have been the most commonly used dyes, leading to excellent photovoltaic performance, particularly with a high efficiency of over 11%.3 Metal-free organic dyes, however, have attracted significant attention as promising alternatives by virtue of their large molar extinction coefficient, facile synthesis, structural diversity and low cost.2,4 The most efficient organic dyes are composed of a donor (D) and an acceptor (A) linked through a π-bridge, whereby an effective intramolecular charge transfer can occur leading to the appearance of a broad and intense absorption band in the visible region. Among D–π–A sensitizers, a variety of organic donors including triphenylamine,5 porphyrin,6 benzofuran,7 and indoline8 have been explored. To date, the best DSSC based on organic sensitizers showed an efficiency of ca. 10%.9
Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), as a strong π-electron donor, has attracted particular attention within the context of materials chemistry towards molecular (opto)electronics.10 Particularly, TTF-based D–π–A systems have found numerous potential applications as their electrochemical and optical properties can be finely tuned by the modulation of the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) transitions.11 However, only two papers on TTF derivatives used in the field of DSSCs have appeared in the literature.12 As the first example, π-extended TTF-sensitized solar cells showed a moderate efficiency up to 3.8%. To achieve the effective charge separation, dithiafulvene-based D–π–A systems have been reported with high efficiencies up to 8.3%. Inspired by these results, we have prepared four new D–π–A dyes (Scheme 1) configured with TTF as a donor and cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor. On the one hand, the variation of π-linkers between the donor and acceptor units of the dyes might tailor their frontier orbital energy levels beneficial to red-shift the charge-transfer transition. The conjugate chains such as vinyl, phenyl and thiophenyl have been incorporated in organic sensitizers. On the other hand, the introduction of n-hexyl groups is expected to prevent the dye aggregation and to retard charge recombination.13 In the present work, we report the synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical and photophysical properties of four dyes as well as their application in DSSCs.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
As illustrated in Scheme 1, the target dyes were obtained by a Knoevenagel reaction of the aldehydes 3–6 and cyanoacetic acid in the presence of ammonium acetate and glacial acetic acid. The aldehyde precursors 3–6 were readily prepared by a palladium catalyzed Stille type coupling reaction between 4-(trimethylstannyl)-4′,5′-bis(hexylthio)-tetrathiafulvalene 1 and the corresponding bromo-substituted aromatic aldehydes, following previously described procedures.14 However, the synthesis of compound 6 was initially attempted by Suzuki coupling of 4′,5′-bis(hexylthio)-TTF-bromo-benzothiadiazole11c and 5-carboxythiophene-2-boronic acid, but the reaction failed to give the desired product, very likely because of the low stability of the TTF–benzothiadiazole precursor in solution. A second synthetic route was thus followed using the commercially available dibromobenzothiadiazole and 5-carboxythiophene-2-boronic acid. Compound 2 was thus obtained in 40% yield by a Suzuki coupling reaction, under microwave irradiation. Although the desired aldehydes 3–6 were obtained in satisfactory quantities for the subsequent preparation of the dyes, Stille coupling reactions under microwave irradiation could also be envisaged to improve the reaction yields. All new compounds were purified by chromatography and fully characterized by NMR and MS spectroscopy data, which are consistent with their proposed structures.
Redox and photophysical properties
The electrochemical and optical properties of organic dyes are very important for the estimation of energy levels, which can give insight into the feasibilities of two processes, namely, electron injection from the photoexcited dyes to the TiO2 conduction band and the dye regeneration. The electrochemical properties of four new dyes in CH2Cl2 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), showing that all of them underwent two reversible one-electron oxidations for the successive generation of the TTF radical cation and the TTF dication (Fig. 1). To some extent, the variation in π-bridges has a certain effect on their redox behaviors. For example, π-extended conjugation in Dye-3 and Dye-4 causes a negative shift of 60–70 mV of the first oxidation potential related to Dye-1 and Dye-2. Benzothiadiazole, as a well-known electron acceptor, was introduced to be part of the π-bridge, however, leading to a lowering of the LUMO rather than the HOMO energy level. The HOMO levels of these dyes are in the range of −4.80 eV to −4.72 eV (Table 1), quite close to the HOMO level of iodide/triiodide (−4.83 eV).15 It can therefore be deduced that the oxidized dyes might not be regenerated immediately and efficiently by triiodide in the electrolyte.16

a The optical band gap is estimated from the onset of the lowest energy absorption band.
b The oxidation potential of Fc+/Fc against Ag/AgCl was recorded in a CH2Cl2–Bu4NPF6 (0.1 M) solution to be 0.49 V, therefore the half-wave potentials are converted to Fc+/Fc by subtracting 0.49 V from Ag/AgCl values.

The electronic spectra of the four dyes were recorded in a THF solution as illustrated in Fig. 2. The electronic transitions can be best characterized in terms of three distinct energy ranges. Firstly, at low energy (λ < 350 nm), all of them show intense absorption bands with extinction coefficients on the order of 104 M−1 cm−1 assigned to the TTF unit. Secondly, in the region between 350 nm and 500 nm, the intense optical absorption bands are attributed to the different π-bridges. Finally, both Dye-1 and Dye-2 exhibit quite similar absorption patterns with a strong and broad absorption band centered at 527 and 507 nm, respectively. A red-shift of the lowest absorption band is in accordance with the previously reported results that can be accounted for by the different aromaticity of the thiophene and furan bridges.17 Compared to Dye-1, Dye-3 reveals the lowest energy absorption band with a much higher extinction coefficient as the consequence of π-conjugation extension. As expected, the introduction of the benzothiadiazole unit leads to a remarkable red shift of the ICT state of Dye-4 with a ε value of 1.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1.

Based on the CV and optical data, the LUMO energy levels of these dyes are estimated to be in a range from −2.69 eV to −3.16 eV (Table 1) that is much higher than the TiO2 conduction band. In principle, this result ensures a sufficient driving force for efficient injection of the photoexcited electrons into the TiO2 conduction band. However, in contrast to the reported π-extended TTF dyes with an out-of-plane butterfly geometry,12a these dyes adopt a planar conformation leading to self-aggregation. It is anticipated that this electron injection process would not be efficient due to substantial charge recombination losses.
Photovoltaic properties of DSSCs based on the synthesized dyes
DSSC experiments were performed using the synthesized dyes according to the methods described in the Experimental section. The detailed photovoltaic parameters, including short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (η) are listed in Table 2. Obviously, the DSSC device performances are evidently affected by the π-bridges in the dyes. Both the Jsc and Voc values increase gradually in the order of Dye-4 < Dye-1 < Dye-3 < Dye-2, which does not completely match the order of the electron-donating ability of the donor part Dye-1 < Dye-2 < Dye-4 < Dye-3. Consistent with the increase in Jsc and Voc, the η values increase progressively from 0.16% (Dye-4) to 0.37% (Dye-1) to 0.79% (Dye-3) and to 0.86% (Dye-2). Dye-2 with furan as a π-bridge has the best photovoltaic performance ascribed to the flatter structure and lower resonance energy of the furan than the thiophene, which facilitates electron injection from the TTF donor into the TiO2.18 Compared to Dye-1, Dye-3 shows an enhanced performance suggesting that the elongation of the π-linkage is favorable for electron transfer into the electrode. However, expansion of π-conjugation increases the propensity of dye aggregation on the surface, leading to a decrease of the electron-injection yield. As a consequence, Dye-4 exhibits a quite poor efficiency despite that it has the best light-harvesting ability among the synthesized sensitizers.

In comparison to the reported π-extended TTF-sensitized solar cells,12a the present examples show quite poor photocurrent generation. Overall, the measured Jsc, Voc and FF are relatively low, which is largely attributed to substantial charge recombination losses during the electron injection process. Given their appropriate LUMO energy levels, self-aggregation of TTF dyes on the TiO2 surface and short-lived charge separation upon photoexcitation as well as the relatively high HOMO energy levels play a crucial role in the injection efficiency. It has been pointed out that the efficiency significantly decreases from 3.8% to 0.4% upon replacing the π-extended TTF with the TTF unit due to the self-aggregation effect.12a In fact, this reported TTF analogue gave a Jsc of 1.6 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.42 V, FF of 0.59, and η of 0.4%, quite comparable to that of Dye-1. Moreover, the relatively high efficiency of π-extended TTF dyes is due to significant evidence for long-lived photoinduced charge-separation, therefore facilitating the electron transfer.10,19 Thus to improve the efficiency of DSSC devices, it is essential to retard the charge recombination.
Conclusions
In summary, we have presented a series of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)-based dyes featured with a donor–bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) structure. The electronic interactions between the TTF donor and the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor through different π-bridges have been demonstrated by the appearance of a photo-induced intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) absorption band in the visible region. A red shift of the ICT state can be finely tuned by the degree of aromaticity and extended conjugation of π-bridges. To some extent, the oxidation potentials are affected by the nature of π-bridges. All of them have a relatively high HOMO energy level and suffer from fast recombination, leading to poor solar energy-to-electricity conversion efficiencies. Among the tested π-bridges, furan is the most efficient π-conjugated linker between the TTF donor and the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor. The application of this synthetic strategy to better sensitizers is currently ongoing. The performance could be enhanced by careful control over the energy gap and HOMO and LUMO energy levels of dyes with further structural modification of the D–π–A system.
Experimental section
General
Air- and/or water-sensitive reactions were conducted under Ar in dry, freshly distilled solvents. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 300 spectrometer operating at 300 MHz for 1H and 75.5 MHz for 13C. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) and are referenced to the residual solvent peak (chloroform, 1H = 7.26 ppm, 13C = 77.0 ppm; THF, 1H = 3.58 ppm, 13C = 67.57 ppm). Coupling constants (J) are given in hertz (Hz). Peak multiplicities are described in the following way: s, singlet; d, doublet; dd, doublet of doublets t, triplet; m, multiplet. HRMS data was obtained with ESI (electrospray ionization) mode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in a three-electrode cell equipped with a Pt-disk working electrode, a glassy carbon counter-electrode, and Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. The electrochemical experiments were carried out under dry conditions and an oxygen-free atmosphere in dichloromethane (DCM) with Bu4N(PF6) (0.1 m) as a supporting electrolyte. The voltammograms were recorded on a PGSTAT 101 potentiostat. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 900 UV/Vis/NIR spectrometer. The melting point was measured using Büchi B-540 microscope apparatus.

General procedure for the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. 
A mixture of cyanoacetic acid (85 mg, 1.0 mmol), ammonium acetate (19 mg, 0.25 mmol), glacial acetic acid (40 mL) and the corresponding aldehyde (0.10 mmol) was purged with argon for 15 min, and then stirred at 125 °C for 24 h.

Fabrication of DSSCs
Electrodes with an 8 μm transparent layer and a 5 μm scattering layer of TiO2 were screen-printed on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) as reported in the literature.21 After sintering at 500 °C for 0.5 h and cooling to room temperature, the electrodes were treated with 33 mM TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 0.5 h. The films were sintered at 500 °C for 0.5 h and cooled to 80 °C before dipping into a dye solution (0.1 mM dye in THF) for 12 h. After the sensitization, the electrodes were rinsed with acetonitrile and dried in air. The cells were sealed with a Surlyn film and a platinized FTO counter electrode. The composition of the electrolyte in this study was 1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile:valeronitrile (85:15, v/v).
