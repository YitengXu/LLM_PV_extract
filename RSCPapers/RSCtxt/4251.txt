1. Introduction
Black phosphorus (BP), an allotrope of the element phosphorus (P) with a layered structure, is a promising member in the family of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Each P atom in a single layer of 2D BP is covalently bound to the three nearest P atoms and the different layers are stacked under van der Waals force.21 An orthorhombic crystal lattice with a puckered honeycomb structure is constructed by the orbitals formed by the sp3 hybridization of P–P bonds.23–25 The surface of 2D BP without any dangling bonds eliminates the issue of lattice mismatch, endowing BP with excellent compatibility with a number of substrates, such as silicon, transparent/flexible polymers, etc.26 The bandgap energy (Eg) of 2D BP is dependent on its layer number, ranging from 0.3 eV (bulk) to 2 eV (single layer), which lies in between that of graphene (0 eV) and TMDCs (higher than 1.57 eV).27–29 Notably, regardless of the thickness of BP, the bandgap is always direct, which makes it a promising material for diverse applications.30 Besides, BP as a p-type semiconductor, has high hole mobility (≈1000 cm2 V−1 s−1), and an excellent theoretical capacity of 2596 mA h g−1, comparable to those of silicon (Si), making it a promising lithium (Li)/sodium (Na)-ion battery anode.25,31
By virtue of these unique features of 2D BP, it has achieved great progress in many fields, such as electrochemistry and energy,32–35 photo/electrocatalysis,36–40 cancer therapy,41,42 photonics,43,44 sensors,27,40 and so on. For example, in 2020, Yin et al. summarized the theoretical and experimental development in the structural engineering strategies and advanced photo/electrocatalysis applications of 2D BP.32 In 2020, Huang and Ang summarized the research on BP-based photonics, including electro-optic modulation, light emission, photodetection, and laser pulse generation, for high-performance on-chip applications using a BP-based component as a compact system.45 In 2018, our group reviewed the latest development of 2D BP with regard to the structure, preparation, and physicochemical properties to biocompatibility, and the biological applications of 2D BP-based nanoplatforms such as phototherapy, therapeutic agent delivery, bioimaging techniques, etc.42 In 2017, the recent developments in the study of 2D BP were also systematically summarized, which covered the synthetic approaches for the preparation of 2D BP, the recent progress in characterizing its optical, electronic, and mechanical properties, and the recently reported functional devices based on these properties.27
Although 2D BP has these superior merits, its several drawbacks, especially poor stability under ambient conditions,46–52 severely hamper the further development of pristine 2D BP. To this end, extensive efforts have been dedicated to overcome the poor stability of 2D BP under ambient conditions, such as h-BN encapsulation,53–55 hybrid Al2O3/BN encapsulation,56 Al2O3 protective layer coating,57 ionophore coating,58 chemical modification,59etc. In the past few years, functional 2D BP nanostructures have gradually drawn great interest and have been successfully fabricated by surface-modifying 2D BP nanomaterials with heteroatoms,46,60–63 small molecules,64–66 macromolecules,67–70 and by hybridizing with other nanomaterials, such as 0D nanocrystals,71–73 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs),74–76 and 2D high-quality graphene,77–79 in order to achieve both remarkably enhanced device performances and ambient stability to satisfy the demand of rapid development of 2D BP-based next-generation devices. However, so far, there have been few comprehensive reviews focusing on functional 2D BP nanostructures and their intriguing applications.
Inspired by functional 2D MXenes reported by Dong et al.80 and functional 2D Xenes reported by Zhang et al.,81 we comprehensively summarize the state-of-the-art progress of functional 2D BP nanostructures including the controlled synthesis and diverse applications, as shown in Fig. 1. Firstly, we focus on the rational synthesis of functional 2D BP nanostructures, including surface-modified 2D BP nanostructures (heteroatom-modified 2D BP nanostructures, small molecule-modified 2D BP nanostructures, and macromolecule-modified 2D BP nanostructures), and mixed-dimensional 2D BP-based heterostructures (2D BP/0D nanomaterial heterostructures, 2D BP/1D nanomaterial heterostructures, 2D BP/2D nanosheet (NS) heterostructures, and 3D hierarchical 2D BP-based heterostructures). Secondly, from the viewpoint of potential applications, the fundamental properties of functional 2D BP nanostructures and recent development in functional 2D BP nanostructure-based devices are systematically summarized. Finally, we provide some personal opinions on future opportunities and challenges in the research and applications of functional 2D BP nanostructures, aiming to pave the way to new designs of well-defined and high-performance functional 2D BP nanostructures for next-generation devices.

2. Synthesis of functional 2D BP nanostructures
With the rapid development of synthetic approaches, the synthesis of functional 2D BP nanostructures has achieved great progress in recent years. In order to distinguish the roles of functional 2D BP nanostructures in the research area, the currently reported functional 2D BP nanostructures can be divided into two models: (i) surface-modified 2D BP nanostructures, including heteroatom-modified 2D BP nanostructures, small molecule-modified 2D BP nanostructures, and macromolecule-modified 2D BP nanostructures; (ii) mixed-dimensional 2D BP-based heterostructures, including 2D BP/0D nanomaterial heterostructures, 2D BP/1D nanomaterial heterostructures, 2D BP/2D NS heterostructures, and 3D hierarchical 2D BP-based heterostructures. In this section, a number of approaches employed for the synthesis of functional 2D BP nanostructures are briefly summarized (Table 1). It should be noted that this section does not cover all the synthetic methods for all of the functional 2D BP nanostructures, and only the extensively used methods are presented.

2.1 Surface-modified 2D BP nanostructures

2.1.1 Heteroatom-modified 2D BP nanostructures. 
BP as a typical layered 2D material is of great interest due to its unique in-plane anisotropic structure, its tunable direct bandgap, high carrier mobility, etc.21,25,27,34,118 However, its rapid degradation upon exposure to ambient conditions turns out to be the critical bottleneck hampering practical applications.23,47,119–123 Actually, it was demonstrated that doping engineering was an efficient method to improve both the physicochemical properties and device performance of BP.46,48,50,52,59,119,124,125 For example, in 2017, our group reported a facile strategy for preparing and stabilizing 2D BP through an ionic liquid-assisted electrochemical exfoliation and synchronous fluorination process.46 The fluorinated phosphorene (FP) was successfully synthesized in a sealed three-electrode electrochemical cell system (Fig. 2a). Here, a low concentration of nonaqueous 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate solution in acetonitrile was employed as the electrolyte, and a BP chuck, an Ag wire and a Pt wire were used as the working electrode, the quasi-reference electrode, and the counter electrode, respectively. A constant potential of +8 V vs. Ag wire was applied to the working electrode in the process. It could be observed that the color of the electrolyte turned from transparent to yellow, orange, and eventually to brown with the electrochemical exfoliation and synchronous fluorination (Fig. 2b). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) image (Fig. 2c) of the as-prepared FP nanosheets (NSs) shows that they have smooth edges, different from pristine 2D BP with a sharp edge, which can be mainly attributed to the fluorination-induced structural changes.46 Thicknesses of 2.1, 3.0, and 3.6 nm of the as-prepared FP NSs in the height profiles (Fig. 2c) correspond to 4, 6 and 7 layers, respectively, given that the thickness of monolayer 2D BP is about 0.54 nm.28 High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2d) shows that the few-layer 2D FP presents a close-to orthorhombic crystal lattice and there are no obvious disorders observed, in good agreement with the atomic structure model of phosphorene.29,126 Besides, the UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectrum of the as-prepared FP in the range of 0.72–4.13 eV (Fig. 2e) shows that the absorbance of the FP almost linearly increases with the incident light energy, while pure BP presents an accelerated enhancement in the UV region.50 Absorption peaks from the layer-dependent-optical bandgaps of BP127 appear in the Vis-NIR region, which can be assigned to FP with a layer number (L) of 1–5 (1.90 eV, 1L; 1.56 and 1.58 eV, 2L; 1.36 eV, 3L; 1.17 eV, 4L; 0.90, 0.96, and 1.01 eV, 5L). An extrapolated high energy transition of 3.13 eV can also be observed in the Tauc plot derived from the UV-Vis-NIR spectrum (Fig. 2e), consistent with the previously reported results for monolayer phosphorene.128 More importantly, the AFM technique was used to characterize the stability of the as-prepared FP and the result reveals that the whole FP NS remains intact and shows no apparent changes such as bubbling and depletion of atomic layers that usually occur in BP under ambient conditions (Fig. 2f), which is also evidenced by the UV-Vis-NIR and Raman results,46 confirming the robust ambient stability of the as-prepared FP by electrochemical exfoliation and synchronous fluorination. This new technique offers an effective method to overcome the drawbacks of easy degradation of BP and other 2D semiconductors under ambient conditions, realizing the practical applications in optical, logic electronics, sensing technologies, etc. In addition, in 2017, Guo et al.48 reported a novel metal-ion modification strategy to improve the stability of 2D BP NSs. The adsorption mechanism of metal ion Ag+ on BP (BPAg(+)) can be seen in Fig. 2g. In the BP structure, the lone pair electrons of the P atoms in each layer are uniformly distributed on the two sides of the layer and interact with each other to form a conjugated π bond, which provides a platform for metal ions such as Ag+ to interact via the cation–π interaction.129 The interaction between 2D BP and metal ions from different views is also shown in Fig. 2g. The Raman scattering spectra of BPAg(+) and bare BP (Fig. 2h) show that three typical BP Raman peaks at 360.9, 438.4, and 466.5 cm−1 are assigned to the A1g, B2g, and A2g vibrational modes of P in BP and BPAg(+), and the A1g peak is strongly enhanced due to the close attachment of Ag+ on the BP surface with the largely increased susceptibility tensor of the A1g mode.129 AFM was also conducted to compare the stability of BP and BPAg(+), as shown in Fig. 2i. The result shows that both BP and BPAg(+) display flat and clean surfaces on the first day. However, after exposure for two days, bubbles appear from the bare BP, and after 5 days the size of the bubbles largely increases and some parts of the bare BP obviously deteriorate. It is noted that the surface morphology of BPAg(+) is well maintained and no obvious bubbles and corrosion are observed after exposure for 5 days, confirming that the modification of BP by metal ions can efficiently protect it from ambient degradation. The histograms of the surface roughness of BP and BPAg(+) (Fig. 2j) also show that BPAg(+) can maintain comparable surface roughness to that of the fresh sample after the five-day exposure to humid air. It is anticipated that BP modified with metal ions, such as Ag+, exhibits excellent ambient stability, which can be employed as a building block for new designs of high-performance optical and electronic devices for practical applications.

2.1.2 Small molecule-modified 2D BP nanostructures. 
Due to the enrichment of P chemistry, and the low cost and diverse selectivity of small molecules, modification of 2D BP by small molecules is usually employed to fabricate functional 2D BP nanostructures for performance improvement, such as sensing and detection performance,89,130 flame retardancy,64,131 (opto)electronics,88,132,133 catalysis,91,134 stability,92,135etc. For example, in 2019, Li et al.90 proposed an efficient strategy to prepare modified BP NSs (p-BP NSs) using aromatic 1-pyrenylbutyric acid via a noncovalent π–π stacking interaction, and provided a reliable platform for precise cancer therapy via the interaction of p-BP NSs with the NH2–PEG–arginine–glycine–aspartic acid (RGD) biomolecule (Fig. 3a). A facile LPE method was used for the fabrication and in situ noncovalent functionalization of BP NSs, as shown in Fig. 3a. TEM images of the as-prepared p-BP NSs show that they present a nanosheet structure with a diameter of less than 200 nm (Fig. 3b), and the HRTEM image shows that the as-prepared p-BPNSs have clear lattice fringes of around 0.22 nm (Fig. 3b inset), consistent with previously reported results.136,137 The zeta potential measurement was carried out to compare the stability difference of the as-prepared p-BPNSs and BP NSs, as shown in Fig. 3c. The suspension of the as-prepared p-BP NSs exhibits a lower zeta potential value (−40.2 mV) than the bare BP NS suspension (−26.1 mV), suggesting that the as-prepared p-BP NSs have a better dispersion ability. Besides, an interesting phenomenon was observed during the preparation process of p-BP NSs: the suspension of p-BP NSs had remarkable stability compared to that of bare BP NSs after sonication for 2 h (Fig. 3c inset), which can be due to the fact that hydrophilic carboxyl chains on the p-BP NS surface distinctly increase the electrostatic repulsion between p-BP NSs, and thereby efficiently prevent the p-BP NSs from restacking. The Raman spectra result shows three typical Raman peaks at 360.1, 436.4, and 464.8 cm−1, corresponding to the A1g, B2g, and A2g modes of BP, respectively, and these peaks redshift by ∼3.2, ∼5.7, and ∼4.6 cm−1, respectively, compared with those of bare BP NSs (Fig. 3d). This phenomenon can be ascribed to the fact that oscillation of the P atoms is slightly restrained when the surface of BP NSs is modified with1-pyrenylbutyric acid, further leading to the slight reduction of the corresponding Raman scattering energy and a detectable red shift of the characteristic Raman peaks.90 Moreover, in 2019, Jain et al.135 reported effective exfoliation and stabilization of few-layer 2D BP NSs in the presence of surfactants (cetrimonium bromide (CTAB) or tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH)). The schematic illustration of the fabrication and modification of few-layer 2D BP NSs can be seen in Fig. 3e. The ionic group in the surfactants allows them to interact with the lone pair electrons of phosphorene, resulting in the lateral (at a low concentration) or vertical (at a high concentration) orientation of the surfactant on the surface of phosphorene (Fig. 3e). Such a self-assembly significantly improves the dispersibility of phosphorene in water, and it is noted that even a noticeably stable dispersion can be obtained at high concentrations of the surfactant solution. TEM and HRTEM images of the few-layer BP NSs exfoliated in the deoxygenated CTAB surfactant solution (BP NSs/CTAB) confirm the orthorhombic crystalline structure throughout the exfoliation process (Fig. 3f). At the same concentration of surfactants, Raman spectroscopy of BP NSs/CTAB shows more obvious shift of the A2g peak (∼3.0–3.5 cm−1) than that of the few-layer 2D BP NSs exfoliated in the deoxygenated TBAOH solution (BP NSs/TBAOH, 0.5 cm−1), implying better intercalation capability of the CTAB surfactant in the BP NS suspension (Fig. 3g). X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy was also employed to understand the influence of surfactant concentration on the intercalation capability between BP layers. It can be observed in Fig. 3h that the XRD pattern of the BP NSs with a high concentration of CTAB presents an additional peak at 2θ = 4.54° compared to that of the BP NSs with a low concentration, indicating that the further increase of the interlayer distance to 19.5 Å can be attributed to the vertically oriented CTAB with a tilt angle of 55.1° between 2D BP layers, given that the length of CTAB is around 25 Å. In addition, in 2018, Hu et al.92 developed a facile and efficient method to covalently functionalize 2D BP NSs with carbon free radicals from azodiisobutyronitrile (AIBN) molecules. A typical procedure for preparing AIBN-modified 2D BPNSs (BP NSs-AIBN) can be seen in Fig. 3i. During the functionalization, the precursor BP NSs were firstly dispersed in a mixed solution of toluene and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) (v/v = 3), and reacted with AIBN at 75 °C for 4 h under argon. After the reaction, the product was purified as below: (i) separated by means of centrifugation; (ii) washed with acetone and isopropanol repeatedly; (iii) then collected and dried overnight under vacuum. TEM image shows that the size of the as-synthesized BP NSs-AIBN ranges from 200 nm to 400 nm (Fig. 3j), consistent with that of the precursor BP NSs, and the clear lattice fringes of 0.53 nm and 0.34 nm can be indexed to the (020) and (021) planes of BP crystal,68,92,138,139 respectively, verifying that the nature of the BP NSs is maintained well throughout the functionalization process. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was carried out to understand the structural changes of the as-synthesized BP NSs-AIBN and the precursor BP NSs. The FT-IR pattern of the as-synthesized BP NSs-AIBN displays a small peak at ∼2235 cm−1, corresponding to the characteristic vibration frequency of the cyano group in AIBN, indicating the successful formation of the P–C covalent bonds between BP NSs and AIBN carbon free radicals (Fig. 3k). Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was also used to characterize the structural formation of P–C covalent bonds and investigate the stability of BP NSs-AIBN in air. The XPS curve of BP NSs-AIBN after exposure to air for 10 days still clearly shows the peaks of P 2p3/2 and P 2p1/2 at 130.0 and 130.9 eV, respectively (Fig. 3l), which can be indexed to the characteristic peaks of crystalline BP, in good agreement with the TEM result. Besides, it should be noted that a peak appears at 133.1 eV, which can be assigned to the P–C bonds, confirming that the 2D BP NSs have been covalently functionalized by the AIBN. More importantly, the integral area value of the oxidation degree of BP NSs-AIBN is 12.62% after exposure to air for 10 days (Fig. 3l), presenting a 4.94% increase compared to that of the fresh sample (7.68%), which is also superior to that of the sample of AIBN molecules physically adsorbed on the surface of BP NSs-AIBN (6.84%). The results demonstrate that the functionalization of 2D BP NSs by AIBN can efficiently protect BP NSs from degradation in air, which has great potential for practical applications of 2D BP.

2.1.3 Macromolecule-modified 2D BP nanostructures. 
In view of the technical issues of mass production and process integration, macromolecule-modified 2D BP nanocomposites have been used to further improve the stability and device performances of 2D BP. Due to the advantages of low cost, easy fabrication, and tunable functionalities, a large number of macromolecules, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG),3,140,141 PAO,67 PEI,93 PDDA,95,96 PDA,69,97 PMMA,18,94,98 PPy,99 polyaniline (PANI),142,143 polyvinyl alcohol (PVA),70,144 polyurethane (PU),145etc., have been used to modify 2D BP to obtain fascinating properties. For example, in 2020, Yuan et al.67 successfully fabricated BP-PAO fiber by introducing BP NSs into PAO by blow-spinning for improved uranium extraction capacity and excellent antibiofouling activity. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image reveals that BP-PAO fiber and PAO fiber have almost similar diameters of 1.47 ± 0.12 μm and 1.49 ± 0.26 μm, respectively (Fig. 4a), and it can be observed that the BP NSs are absorbed on the BP-PAO fiber (Fig. 4b). The UV-Vis-NIR spectra of the BP-PAO fiber and PAO fiber show that the light adsorption capacity of the BP-PAO fiber is distinctly superior to that the PAO fiber due to the existence of 2D BP NSs (Fig. 4c). The photothermal and photoelectric effect of the BP NSs in BP-PAO fiber have a significant effect on the coordination interaction between UO22+ and the functional amidoxime group, and electrostatic attraction to the negative [UO2-(CO3)3]4−, respectively, which result in improved capacity for uranium adsorption.67 Besides, in 2018, Cao et al.146 employed 4-bromobenzenediazonium (4-BBD)-functionalized BP (4-BBD-BP) as a 2D template to successfully in situ synthesize poly[(1,4-diethynylbenzene)-alt-9,9-bis(4-diphenylaminophenyl)fluorene]-(PDDF)-covalently grafted BP (PDDF-g-BP), as shown in Fig. 4d. By comparison with BP, PDDF, and PDDF/BP blends, the as-synthesized PDDF-g-BP exhibits excellent solubility in organic solvents, as shown in Fig. 4e and f. AFM image of PDDF-g-BP shows a very small average roughness of only 2.1 nm (Fig. 4g) compared to that of the precursor 4-BBD-BP (132.5 nm), which has great potential in memory devices as a smooth interface at both material/metal contacts that can dramatically enhance charge injection and transport.146 FT-IR spectra show that characteristic peaks of the few-layer BP and PDDF are clearly visible in the FT-IR spectrum of the PDDF-g-BP composite film (Fig. 4h), suggesting that the chemical properties of 2D BP NSs were well preserved throughout the fabrication process. The as-synthesized PDDF-g-BP-based device exhibits a nonvolatile rewritable memory performance, with lower turn-on and turn-off voltages and a higher ON/OFF ratio, which remarkably outperforms the PDDF/BP blends.146 Additionally, in 2017, Sajedi-Moghaddam et al.142 reported a novel BP/polyaniline (PANI) nanostructure by in situ oxidative polymerization using 2D BP NSs as initiators and aniline as a monomer, as shown in Fig. 4i. The few-layer 2D BP NSs with a large surface area serve as 2D substrates for the polymerization and growth of aniline monomer. The TEM morphology of the as-synthesized BP NSs/PANI shows that the 2D structure of BP NSs is well preserved during the in situ oxidative polymerization of aniline monomer. The successful growth of PANI on 2D BP NSs was further verified by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping images of P, N, and C (Fig. 4j). The 2D morphology of BP NSs provides large-surface-area support for nucleation of PANI, and offers more ion-accessible sites to the active material, which has great potential in high-performance energy storage devices.

2.2 Mixed-dimensional 2D BP-based heterostructures

2.2.1 2D BP/0D nanomaterial heterostructures. 
In general, 0D materials are considered as particles with all three dimensionalities less than 100 nm.120,147–156 0D nanostructures usually refer to nanodots, nanospheres, and nanoparticles. In many cases, serious aggregation of 0D nanomaterials severely reduces their high surface energies. Rational design and controlled synthesis of 2D BP/0D nanomaterial heterostructures can efficiently combine the advantages of both individual components and intentionally overcome their shortcomings. So far, a variety of 2D BP/0D nanomaterial heterostructures, such as the 2D BP/0D perovskite CsPbBr3 nanocrystal heterostructure,71 2D BP/0D Co single atom heterostructure,102 2D BP/0D Ag NP heterostructure,72,103,157 2D BP/0D Au NP heterostructure,104,158–161 2D BP/0D Cu7S4 nanocage heterostructure,162 2D BP/0D PtCu nanocluster heterostructure,73 2D BP/0D Co2P nanocrystal heterostructure,22etc., have been designed and fabricated for high-performance 2D BP-based devices. For example, in 2020, Wang et al.71 introduced 0D all-inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 nanocrystals for immobilization onto 2D BP NSs by a self-assembly method to fabricate a new and effective 2D BP/0D perovskite CsPbBr3 nanocrystal heterostructure-based photocatalyst for CO2 photoreduction. The schematic of the fabrication of 2D BP/0D CsPbBr3 heterostructures can be seen in Fig. 5a. TEM image shows that the precursor CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are uniformly assembled on the 2D BP NSs (Fig. 5b), and the HRTEM image displays crystal lattice fringes of 0.41 nm and 0.26 nm, which can be assigned to the (110) plane of CsPbBr3 crystal and (040) plane of BP crystal, respectively.71,102 EDX elemental mapping was also carried out to characterize the different elements in the as-prepared 2D BP/0D CsPbBr3 heterostructures. The corresponding elements, P, Cs, Pb, and Br, in the corresponding TEM area are shown in Fig. 5c and d. From the images it can be seen that the red area matches well with the shape of BP and the small particles represented with other colors are in good accordance with the 0D CsPbBr3 nanocrystals assembling onto 2D BP NSs. Raman spectroscopy was also employed to characterize the as-prepared 2D BP/0D CsPbBr3 heterostructures, as shown in Fig. 5e. The three Raman peaks at 358, 431, and 458 cm−1 for the as-prepared 2D BP/0D CsPbBr3 heterostructures can be assigned to the A1g, B2g, and A2g phonon modes of 2D BP, respectively,90,163,164 all of which are slightly shifted compared to those of the precursor 2D BP NSs, consistent with the aforementioned result for p-BP NSs (Fig. 3d).90 It is demonstrated that the as-prepared 2D BP/0D perovskite CsPbBr3 nanocrystal heterostructure paves the way for the hybridization of 2D BP with 0D all-inorganic perovskite nanocrystals for new designs of high-performance photocatalysts for solar energy conversion. Moreover, in 2019, Li et al.73 successfully fabricated 2D BP/0D PtCu nanocluster heterostructures by the combination of an LPE method and chemical reduction. In this experiment, 2D BP NSs were prepared from the corresponding bulk powders by an LPE method, and the precursor (H2PtCl6·6H2O, RuCl3·xH2O) and surfactants were added into the as-exfoliated BP dispersion for in situ synthesis of 2D BP/0D PtCu nanocluster heterostructures. TEM image shows that PtRu nanoclusters with a relatively narrow size distribution are uniformly distributed on the surface of the as-exfoliated 2D BP NSs (Fig. 5f), and the statistical average size of PtRu nanoclusters is around 2.5 nm (Fig. 5f inset and Fig. 5g). The lattice spacing of 0.224 nm can be indexed to the (111) planes of the PtRu alloy because of the smaller lattice constant of Ru (0.221 nm, PDF# 88-2333) compared to that of Pt (0.226 nm, PDF# 01-1190).73 The stable crystalline structure of BP in the fabrication process and the strong interactions between 2D BP NSs and 0D PtRu nanoclusters were determined by Raman spectroscopy. The large shift of Raman peaks observed in Fig. 5h could be attributed to the induced strain to the 2D BP NSs after the 0D PtRu nanoclusters grew onto 2D BP NSs. EDX elemental mapping image of the 2D BP/0D PtCu nanocluster heterostructures manifests the uniform distribution of Pt and Ru on the 2D BP NSs (Fig. 5i–k). Due to the superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and outstanding stability, the 2D BP/0D PtCu nanocluster heterostructure offers an alternative strategy to realize advanced electrocatalysis.

2.2.2 2D BP/1D nanomaterial heterostructures. 
Typical 1D nanostructures with a size range of 1 nm to 100 nm in two dimensionalities while being extended in the third dimensionality have been intensively researched due to their unique features.165–174 Synergistic effects arising from the structural advantages of both 2D BP and 1D nanostructure are expected for 2D BP/1D nanomaterial heterostructures which are beneficial for achieving appealing performances. In recent years, much interest has been shown towards incorporating 1D nanostructures into 2D BP NSs to fabricate various heterostructures, with improved properties and synergistic functionalities, such as the 2D BP/1D anthraquinone nanowire heterostructure,105 2D BP/1D poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) nanofiber heterostructure,107 2D BP/1D TiO2 nanorod array heterostructure,13 2D BP/1D ZnO nanowire heterostructure,106,175 2D BP/1D cellulose nanofiber heterostructure,7 and 2D BP/1D carbon nanotube (CNT) heterostructure,19,75,76,176,177 for achieving excellent performances in advanced applications. For example, in 2020, Qiu et al.7 presented a series of bioinspired heterostructures composed of 1D NFC and hydroxyl functionalized 2D BP (BP-OH) by self-assembly for improved mechanical properties and enhanced fire resistance. The schematic diagram of the fabrication process of the 2D BP-OH/1D NFC heterostructure film can be seen in Fig. 6a. Briefly, 2D BP-OH was facilely synthesized by ball-milling in the presence of LiOH, and then BP-OH dispersion was dropwise added into the NFC suspension for the preparation of the 2D BP-OHx/1D NFCy heterostructures via hydrogen bonding interaction. Here, x and y represent the weight ratios of 2D BP-OH and 1D NFC in the heterostructure, respectively. SEM was carried out to characterize the microstructures of the as-fabricated 2D BP-OH/1D NFC heterostructure films with different contents of the components. As shown in Fig. 6b–d, the “brick-and-mortar” structure of the as-fabricated 2D BP-OHx/1D NFCy heterostructure (x = 10, 25, and 40; y = 90, 75, and 60) can be seen clearly. The BP-OH10/NFC90 and BP-OH25/NFC75 heterostructure films display a compactly stacked layered structure and the cross-linking NFC tightly encompasses the 2D BP-OH NSs, leading to their directional alignment along the planar direction (Fig. 6b and c). With the increase of BP-OH content in the BP-OH/NFC heterostructure film up to 40 wt%, a wavy lamellar structure is formed (Fig. 6d). Therefore, in these nacre-inspired heterostructures, the 2D BP-OH nanosheet acts as an inorganic “brick” and the 1D cross-linked NFC as an organic “mortar”, evidenced by the SEM image and the corresponding elemental mapping images of the BP-OH25/NFC75 heterostructure film (Fig. 6e). Furthermore, in 2020, Xu et al.13 demonstrated an efficient photoelectrode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting based on ultrathin 2D BP NSs coated on TiO2 nanorod arrays. The photoelectrode of the 2D BP/1D TiO2 nanorod array heterostructure was readily fabricated by spin coating a predetermined 2D BP NSs/ethanol dispersion onto hot TiO2 nanorod/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) (100 °C) at 2000 rpm for 20 s. The SEM image and the corresponding elemental mapping images reveal the spatial distribution of P, O, and Ti in the as-fabricated 2D BP/1D TiO2 nanorod array heterostructure (Fig. 6f), indicating that the BP NSs are uniformly decorated on the surface of the 1D TiO2 nanorod arrays. The TEM image of the as-fabricated 2D BP/1D TiO2 nanorod array heterostructure shows that the 2D BP NSs are still perfectly connected with the TiO2 nanorods even after strong ultrasonication in the preparation process of the TEM sample, suggesting the strong interaction between the BP NSs and TiO2 nanorods (Fig. 6g). The lattice spacings of 0.325 nm and 0.327 nm correspond to the (110) plane of the TiO2 crystal and (021) plane of the BP crystal, respectively (Fig. 6h).13 Besides, the blue dotted circles marked in Fig. 6h display a clear interface interaction in the BP/TiO2 junction, similar to the recently reported data based on 2D MXene Ti3C2Tx/0D TiO2 nanoparticle heterostructure.178 Additionally, in 2017, Bat-Erdene et al.19 fabricated few-layer 2D BP NSs by a microwave-assisted LPE technique and integrated them into single walled CNTs (SWCNTs)-Si-based heterojunction solar cells (HJSCs) for high-performance solar cells. The SEM image of the pure SWCNTs can be observed in Fig. 6i. A predetermined volume of the precursor few-layer 2D BP NS dispersion was added into the aqueous SWCNT dispersion to fabricate the 2D BP/1D SWCNT heterostructure. The SEM image of the as-fabricated heterostructure shows that 1D SWCNTs with a diameter of few nanometers are closely wrapped around the 2D BP NSs with a lateral size of ≈1.5 μm (Fig. 6j), indicating the successful incorporation of the 2D few-layer BP NSs into the 1D SWCNTs. The Raman spectrum (Fig. 6k) of the as-fabricated heterostructure displays all the typical peaks of both 1D SWCNTs and 2D BP NSs (Fig. 6k inset). It should be pointed out that both the dispersion of the as-fabricated 2D BP/1D SWCNT heterostructure and the film fabricated still remained stable after several months, verifying that the introduction of 1D SWCNTs into 2D BP can remarkably improve the environmental stability.

2.2.3 2D BP/2D nanosheet heterostructures. 
2D nanomaterials, such as graphene,179–182 phosphorene,27,29,183 bismuthene,120,148 antimonene,184–186 tellurene,187–189 borophene,190etc., typically have a small atomic thickness. So far, a large number of 2D BP/2D NS heterostructures, such as 2D BP/2D graphene heterostructure,12,79,191–195 2D BP/2D graphene oxide (GO) heterostructure108 and 2D BP/2D reduced graphene oxide (rGO) heterostructure,77,78,196 2D BP/2D transition metal dichalcogenide (MoS2, WSe2, etc.) heterostructures,9,15–17,197,198 2D BP/2D MXene heterostructures,8,11,199,200etc., have been demonstrated to be capable of achieving significantly enhanced performances by loading 2D NSs on the surface of BP with intimate contact. For example, in 2020, Guo et al.8 reported a 2D BP/2D MXene Ti3C2Tx heterostructure-based anode with an in situ fabricated fluorinated interphase for fast sodium storage. A 2D BP/2D MXene Ti3C2Tx heterostructure was successfully fabricated by solution mixing of 2D BP and 2D MXene Ti3C2Tx, followed by self-assembly during freeze-drying (Fig. 7a). The TEM image reveals that the 2D BP NSs are covered by the 2D MXene Ti3C2Tx NSs with a larger lateral size (Fig. 7b). The HRTEM image of the 2D BP/2D MXene Ti3C2Tx heterostructure shows that a monolayer of phosphorene is well sandwiched between two MXene Ti3C2Tx layers (Fig. 7c), and an atomic model has been clearly illustrated (Fig. 7c inset). The scanning TEM image with EDS mapping results also reveals that 2D BP NSs are evenly distributed and sandwiched by the 2D MXene Ti3C2Tx NSs with a larger lateral size (Fig. 7d). Interestingly, it is demonstrated that the self-assembly of 2D BP NSs on the 2D MXene Ti3C2Tx NSs not only largely promotes the migration of both electrons and sodium cations but also apparently weakens the structural expansion of phosphorene, and thereby significantly enhances the cycling performance of the heterostructure-based anode.8 Moreover, in 2020, Liang et al.15 reported a facile synthesis of an affordable electrocatalyst through in situ growth of MoS2 NSs vertically on electro-exfoliated 2D BP NSs for HER performance. The synthesis process of the 2D BP/2D MoS2 heterostructure can be seen in Fig. 7e. The sponge-like 2D BP NSs were facilely fabricated using bulk BP crystals through an electrochemical exfoliation method, and the MoS2 NSs were vertically grown on both sides of the electro-exfoliated 2D BP NSs by a solvothermal method, leading to the formation of a 2D BP/2D MoS2 heterostructure. The TEM image of the as-synthesized 2D BP/2D MoS2 heterostructure shows that 2D MoS2 NSs are uniformly distributed on the electro-exfoliated BP NSs (Fig. 7f). The HRTEM image shows a crystal distance of 0.336 nm (Fig. 7g), which can be assigned to the (021) plane of bulk BP,13 and the lattice fringes within the green dotted line confirm the typical folds of MoS2. The EDX mapping images illustrate the uniform distribution of the corresponding elements (P, Mo, and S) in the as-synthesized heterostructure (Fig. 7h). All the above-mentioned results prove the successful formation of the 2D BP/2D MoS2 heterostructure. In addition, in 2020, Zong et al.16 introduced a simple van der Waals heterostructure consisting of thin-film BP and TMDCs, for mid-infrared (MIR) light-emission applications, where 2D BP acts as an MIR-emission layer. Fig. 7i shows a schematic of the 2D BP/2D TMDC heterostructure. The bottom TMDC layer has a layer of W/Mo atoms sandwiched between two Se/S atom layers, and the P atoms in each layer of BP have a folded anisotropic honeycomb structure. TMDC NSs and thin film BP were mechanically exfoliated onto SiO2/Si and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates, respectively, and then the thin-film BP was easily transferred onto the TMDCs by a PDMS-assisted transfer method.16 An optical image of a typical 2D BP/2D WSe2 heterostructure sample is provided in Fig. 7j in which the contours of the monolayer WSe2 and thin film BP are marked by orange and blue dashed lines, respectively. PL properties of the as-fabricated 2D BP/2D WSe2 heterostructure sample in the visible region were investigated. High PL intensity can be clearly observed in the monolayer WSe2 region due to the high quantum efficiency and high light absorption, in good accordance with the previous studies,201,202 while significant PL quenching is also obvious in the 2D BP/2D WSe2 heterojunction area (Fig. 7k). It is anticipated that the 2D BP/2D TMDC heterojunction can provide a promising platform for MIR property studies and applications.16

2.2.4 2D BP-based 3D hierarchical heterostructures. 
Heterostructures based on 2D BP NSs are of great value in the field of materials science because they usually possess advanced physical and chemical properties, and promising applications in a range of technological areas, such as energy conversion and storage, catalysis, sensors, and nanomedicines.203–207 The fabrication of 2D BP NS-based heterostructures and the exploration of their potential applications have been research hotspots in recent years. So far, numerous 2D BP-based 3D hierarchical heterostructures, such as highly 2D BP-doped 3D graphene hydrogel,208 3D BP sponges,113 2D BP-loaded PCL scaffolds,114 2D BP/2D GO-based 3D printed scaffolds,209 2D BP-reinforced 3D printed scaffolds,115 2D BP/2D rGO-based aerogels,116etc., have been successfully fabricated for significantly improved performances. For example, in 2019, Liu et al.209 developed a 3D printed biodegradable scaffold consisting of a biodegradable poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF) matrix, coated with either 2D GO NSs, 2D BP NSs, or a 2D BP/2D GO heterostructure. As shown in Fig. 8a, the 3D scaffolds were rationally designed by computer-aided design (CAD) with external dimensions of 5 mm in length, width, and height, and printed by 3D stereolithography layer-by-layer using UV cross-linking of a PPF/diethyl fumarate (DEF) polymer resin, followed by ammonolysis and functionalization with 2D GO NSs and 2D BP NSs. A 2D BP/2D GO heterostructure was facilely fabricated by simply mixing 2D BP NSs with 2D GO under sonication. The TEM image shows that the 2D BP NSs exfoliated by the LPE method are homogeneously dispersed within the 2D GO,209 and they are intimately covered by a 2D GO layer with a larger lateral size (Fig. 8b). The EDX elemental mapping images of C and O (main components of 2D GO NSs), and P (main component of 2D BP NSs) show that 2D BP NSs (green area) are uniformly distributed on the 2D GO NSs (Fig. 8c). The ammonolysis of 3D scaffolds was conducted in a hexamethylenediamine/isopropyl alcohol mixed solution at 60 °C for 30 min in order to generate amine groups by breaking the ester bonds in the PPF polymer chains. After ammonolysis, the 3D scaffolds were coated in different solutions, such as 1 mg mL−1 2D BP NSs, 1 mg mL−1 2D GO NSs, or 1 mg mL−1 2D BP/2D GO heterostructures, and the corresponding images of scaffolds after coating can be seen in Fig. 8d. The 2D BP/2D GO heterostructure-based 3D scaffolds demonstrated that the enhanced surface area provided by 2D GO NSs greatly promoted cell attachment at the initial stage, and then slow oxidation of 2D BP NSs wrapped within 2D GO NSs led to a continuous release of phosphate, which was an important osteoblast differentiation facilitator for stimulating cell osteogenesis for the formation of new bones.209 In addition, in 2018, Yang et al.115 designed an exquisite therapeutic platform by integrating 2D BP NSs into a 3D printed (BG) scaffold for the preparation of a bifunctional 2D BP-BG scaffold for both photothermal therapy of osteosarcoma and bone regeneration, as shown in Fig. 8e. The well-controlled macropores and the disordered surface topography of the as-fabricated 2D BP-BG scaffolds (Fig. 8f–h) are highly conducive to osteogenesis and osteointegration, which greatly promotes the interlocking between the surrounding natural bones and the scaffolds. The scaffold changes from white to light black after the 2D BP NSs get involved (Fig. 8f inset), while the 2D BP NSs become more visible on the disordered surface of BP-BG scaffolds with increasing content according to SEM images at different magnifications.115 The corresponding EDX elemental mapping images demonstrate that the elements Si, O, and Ca are homogeneously distributed on the BG scaffolds, while the element P mainly accumulates on the strut surface of the BG scaffolds rather than on the fractured cross-section (Fig. 8i and j), which can be mainly ascribed to the adhesion and spreading of the 2D BP NSs. It was demonstrated that the novel 2D BP-BG scaffolds enabled both photothermal ablation of osteosarcoma and the material-guided bone regeneration in the physiological microenvironment, and endowed the scaffolds with excellent physicochemical properties, which could significantly promote the whole therapeutic process.115

3. Related applications
In comparison to pristine 2D BP nanostructures, functional 2D BP nanostructures, including surface-modified 2D BP nanostructures and mixed-dimensional 2D BP-based heterostructures, exhibit distinctly enhanced performances because of the synergistic effect, which open potential opportunities for next-generation devices in a variety of fields. Investigations of the properties of functional 2D BP nanostructures play a decisive role in understanding the structure–property relationships and the related applications of functional 2D BP nanostructures. In this section, the related applications (energy storage and conversion, (opto)electronics, catalysis, sensors, nonlinear photonics, and biomedical applications) of functional 2D BP nanostructures are presented.
3.1 Energy storage and conversion
As a new type of 2D semiconductor material, 2D BP displays good electron mobility, special semiconductor band gap, high leakage current modulation rate and high theoretical specific capacity, and has drawn growing interest in recent years.210–212 However, the severe restacking issue in the process of electrode fabrication and the large volume variation during electrochemical cycling are the most crucial factors that severely hinder the rapid development of 2D BP-related electrodes.8,79,196,213–215 To overcome these issues, the rational design and facile fabrication of functional 2D BP nanostructures, including surface-modified 2D BP, and mixed-dimensional 2D BP-based heterostructures for further improvement of electrochemical performances, are of great value.
With regard to electrochemical performances in batteries, it was demonstrated that the restacking of 2D BP NSs and volume change during electrochemical cycling can be efficiently prevented by the introduction of heteroatoms or nanomaterials which act as space fillers, and thereby remarkably improve the ionic conduction kinetics and long-term cycling stability.8,78,79,96,107,177,196,200,208,215–217 For example, in 2020, Rojaee et al.216 reported a new kind of quasi-solid lithium ion (Li+) conductive nanocomposite polymer electrolyte based on 2D BP NSs for Li metal batteries. The schematic diagram of the synthetic procedure for the 2D BP NSs/composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) can be seen in Fig. 9a. A ternary polymer electrolyte containing poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME), and 1-ethyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (EMIM-TFSI), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI), and 2D BP NSs were employed in this study. The CPE with no 2D BP NSs is abbreviated as CPE-0P while the CPE with 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2 wt% 2D BP NS additives are labeled CPE-0.05P, CPE-0.1P, CPE-0.5P, CPE-1P, and CPE-2P, respectively. It can be seen that with increasing concentration of 2D BP NSs, the color of the 2D BP NSs/CPE dispersion becomes darker (Fig. 9a inset). The ionic conductivity of the CPE-0P, CPE-0.1P, and CPE-0.5P electrolytes vs. temperature was studied, which shows that the ionic conductivity at 25 °C increases from 5.9 × 10−4 S cm−1 (CPE-0P) to 1.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 (CPE-0.1P) and 2.4 × 10−3 S cm−1 (CPE-0.5P), respectively (Fig. 9b), and the Nyquist plots show that the resistance of 2D BP/CPE significantly decreases with increasing concentration of 2D BP NSs (Fig. 9b inset), both of which verify that the introduction of 2D BP NSs remarkably facilitates Li+ ion transport in the polymeric network in the process of charge/discharge. More importantly, the rate performance of the electrolytes monitored at different current densities reveals that CPE-0.5P can exhibit ≈80% capacity retention at 420 mA g−1 while CPE-0P can only retain 10% of the initial capacity under the same conditions (Fig. 9c), suggesting that 2D BP NSs indeed efficiently promote Li+ ion transport and improve the full capacity extraction. Moreover, in 2020, Guo et al.8 reported a 2D BP/2D MXene Ti3C2Tx heterostructure for fast and stable sodium storage. It was demonstrated that the combination of 2D BP NSs with MXene Ti3C2Tx not only largely facilitated the migration of both electrons and sodium cations but also greatly alleviated the expansion of 2D BP NSs, and thereby significantly improved the cycling performance of the heterostructure-based anode. The discharge and charge profiles of the 2D BP/2D MXene Ti3C2Tx heterostructure-based anode show a first discharge and charge capacity of 845 and 533 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 9d). It should be noted that more than 80% of discharge capacity is derived from the lower voltage region (<1.0 V), which has a great effect on the total energy density as the heterostructure-based anode is employed in real applications in full Na-ion batteries. For comparison, the cycling performances of the 2D BP/2D MXene Ti3C2Tx heterostructure, mixed 2D BP/2D MXene Ti3C2Tx, pure 2D MXene Ti3C2Tx, and pure 2D BP were studied at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 9e. It is observed that the 2D BP/2D MXene Ti3C2Tx heterostructure presents excellent cycling stability with a capacity of 467 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, while the capacity of mixed 2D BP/2D MXene Ti3C2Tx gradually decreases to 171 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, and the capacities of pure 2D MXene Ti3C2Tx and pure 2D BP apparently decimate after several cycles (Fig. 9e), verifying that the 2D BP/2D MXene Ti3C2Tx heterostructure has great potential in practical applications of Na-ion batteries. The rate performance of the 2D BP/2D MXene Ti3C2Tx heterostructure displays reversible capacities of 535, 469, 408, 343, 266, and 193 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 9f), mainly attributed to the large proportion of pseudocapacitive charge storage in the 2D BP/2D MXene Ti3C2Tx heterostructure. Moreover, the cycling performance of the 2D BP/2D MXene Ti3C2Tx heterostructure-based electrode at a current density of 1.0 A g−1 shows that a high capacity of 298 mA h g−1 (87% capacity retention) is maintained after 1000 cycles (Fig. 9g), demonstrating that it has an excellent long-term cycling stability. This work can provide fundamental guidance on the new designs of 2D BP NS-based heterostructures for rechargeable batteries with fast charging, high energy density, and long cycle life.

In terms of electrochemical performance in supercapacitors, 2D BP has shown fascinating properties as an electrode material due to the large spacing (5.3 Å) between adjacent puckered layers, which is similar to that of 1T phase MoS2 (6.15 Å) and much larger than that of graphene (3.6 Å),218 allowing easy intercalation and fast diffusion of cations (e.g., H+, Li+ or Na+) confirmed by theoretical results.219,220 Similar to functional 2D graphene,215 functional TMDs221 or functional Xenes,120,203 functional 2D BP nanostructures have also been demonstrated to be capable of remarkably improving the electrochemical energy storage.76,99,108,113,176,222 For example, in 2018, our group reported a laminated 2D BP/polypyrrole (PPy) film with improved capacitance and cycling stability by a simple electrochemical deposition method.222 PPy is an ideal candidate for constructing flexible supercapacitors due to its high electrochemical activity and excellent flexibility. The as-fabricated 2D BP/PPy laminated film has excellent mechanical flexibility, and the 2D BP/PPy laminated film-based supercapacitor also has similar outstanding mechanical flexibility, evidenced by the bending measurement, which demonstrated that the supercapacitor can recover more than 92% of its original capacitance at various bending angles (0–180°), as shown in Fig. 10a. Moreover, even after 3000 bending cycles (bending angle from 0° to 135°), cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the supercapacitor show that there is no obvious degradation and capacitance change, suggesting that it has excellent structural integrity and superior mechanical flexibility (Fig. 10a inset). The cycling stability of the 2D BP/PPy laminated film-based supercapacitor device reveals that there is no obvious capacitance loss after 12000 charging/discharging cycles, which can be mainly ascribed to the merits of the laminated structure in flexible electrodes (Fig. 10b). It should also be noted that the flexible supercapacitor device delivers a high energy density of 30.8 W h kg−1 at a power density of 700 W kg−1, and maintains 10.5 W h kg−1 even at 7000 W kg−1 as shown in the Ragone plot (Fig. 10c), which are significantly superior to previously reported symmetric systems, such as layered rGO/PPy composite (27.3 W h kg−1 at 305 W kg−1),223 3D GO/PPy composite (15.1 W h kg−1 at 80 W kg−1),224 MXene/PPy hybrid (20 W h kg−1 at 1000 W kg−1),225 flower-like rGO/PPy hybrid (7 W h kg−1 at 90 W kg−1),226 paper-like 1D CNT/polyaniline composite (7.1 W h kg−1 at 700 W kg−1),227 and MnO2 coated Au stem device (20 W h kg−1 at 400 W kg−1).228 In addition, in 2018, Wu et al.76 successfully fabricated a 2D BP/1D CNT heterostructure by microfluidic-spinning via the formation of P–C bonds under heat treatment. In this heterostructure, 1D CNTs are chemically connected to 2D BP NSs by P–C chemical bonds. For clarity, a wire/wire structure of pure CNTs, a wire/sheet structure of CNTs/BP, and a wire/sheet/wire heterostructure of CNTs/BP-CNTs were designed for high-energy flexible supercapacitors (Fig. 10d), where CNTs/BP refers to the physical mixture of 1D CNTs and 2D BP NSs, and CNTs/BP-CNTs refers to the physical mixture of 1D CNTs and 2D BP/1D CNT heterostructure. The specific volumetric capacitances of CNTs, CNTs/BP and CNTs/BP-CNTs were compared and it was found that the as-fabricated CNTs/BP-CNTs displays the highest specific capacitance of 308.7 F cm−3 at 0.1 A cm−3, obviously superior to those of pure CNTs and CNTs/BP with specific capacitances of 119.6 and 235.5 F cm−3, respectively (Fig. 10e). This impressive result can be attributed to the enhanced interlayer conductivity and electrochemical activity of BP-CNTs in the unique 2D/1D heterostructure. The life cycle stabilities of the CNTs, CNTs/BP and CNTs/BP-CNTs-based supercapacitors show that pure CNTs retain 94.2% of their initial capacitance after 10000 cycles while the CNTs/BP retains only 86.1% of its initial capacitance due to the poor interaction between 2D BP layers (Fig. 10f). Note that the capacitance retention of CNTs/BP-CNTs was still 90.2%, indicating that the embedded CNTs in the CNTs/BP-CNTs can significantly improve the mechanical stability. As we know, the energy and power densities play an important role in the energy storage performance. It can be found that at a power density of 0.15–15 W cm−3, CNTs/BP-CNTs have a volumetric energy density of 45.6–96.5 mW h cm−3 (Fig. 10g), suggesting that both the energy and power densities of the flexible supercapacitors are pretty good. It should be pointed out that the maximum volumetric energy density of the CNTs/BP-CNT-based supercapacitor is comparable to those of the commercial product and composited 2D layered analogues (Fig. 10g), such as Li thin-film batteries, CNTs (2 mW h cm−3),229 rGO (2.5 mW h cm−3),230 BP (2.5 mW h cm−3),231 CNTs/rGO (6.3 mW h cm−3),232 graphene/PANI (8.80 mW h cm−3),233 Co3O4/Co(OH)2 (9.4 mW h cm−3),234 and MXene/graphene (32.6 mW h cm−3).235 Furthermore, the flexibility and deformability of the CNTs/BP-CNT-based supercapacitor were measured under continuous bending, as shown in Fig. 10h. There are slight increases in capacitances, i.e., 99.6% (265.9 F cm−3), 98.5% (263.0 F cm−3), 102.1% (272.3 F cm−3) and 100.5% (268.3 F cm−3) retentions of the initial flat-state capacitance (267.0 F cm−3) are achieved under different bending angles (45°, 90°, 135° and 180°), respectively. The capacitive retentions are 97.6% (260.1 F cm−3), 95.5% (255.0 F cm−3), 98.5% (263.0 F cm−3) and 97.4% (260.0 F cm−3), after 1000 continuous cyclic tests at bending angles of 45°, 90°, 135° and 180°, respectively (Fig. 10h inset). The 2D BP/1D CNT heterostructure opens up new opportunities for multifunctional 2D BP-based heterostructures and advances the development of next-generation energy storage devices.

3.2 (Opto)electronics
2D BP has attracted extensive attention in the field of electronics, such as field-effect transistors (FETs) and impact-ionization transistors (IITs), due to its tunable direct bandgap, high carrier mobility, and unique in-plane anisotropic structure.32,40,119,120 In recent years, a large volume of research has focused on functional 2D BP-based (opto)electronics with both high device performance and excellent stability, such as single atom (N, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth)-doped 2D BP-based FET,236 tellurium (Te) or selenium (Se)-doped 2D BP-based FET,86,237,238 perylene diimide-modified 2D BP-based FET,88 2D BP/2D graphene/2D InSe-based FET,10 2D BP/2D n-ReS2-based photodetector,239 2D BP/2D WSe2-based MIR light-emitting diode,16 2D BP/2D n-PdSe2 or n-InGaAs-based diode,1,240etc., to meet the growing demand of practical applications. Recently, Gao et al.10 reported a novel IIT based on vertical graphene/BP/InSe heterostructures. The schematic illustration of the graphene/BP/InSe van der Waals heterojunction can be seen in Fig. 11a, where a BP NS with a thickness of ≈9 nm is sandwiched between graphene (<3 layers) and InSe with a thickness of ≈20 nm. In this design, the biased graphene electrode connected to the p-type BP layer acts as the drain and the grounded metal electrode connected to the n-type InSe layer is used as the source.10 The graphene, InSe, and BP layers and the connected electrodes are outlined with different colors in the typical optical microscopy image (Fig. 11b). It can be seen in Fig. 11b inset that there are clear interfaces between the employed layered materials. From the transfer curves of the graphene/BP/InSe-based IITs at different bias voltages (Vdss) at 200 K we can see that the current (Ids)-bate-gate voltage (Vbg) curves display normal n-type transistor behavior at forward and moderate reverse biases, and under a forward Vds, especially at high Vds, the transfer curves of the IIT are dominated by the lateral InSe-based transistor as the junction resistance is much smaller than that of the lateral InSe-based FET (Fig. 11c). It should be noted that an ultrasteep gate-modulated transition from the OFF state to the ON state with >105 current contrast can be obtained when the value of the reverse Vds is more than a certain threshold (Vds = −2 V here). Besides, even for 300 nm-thick silica dielectrics, the average subthreshold slope (SS) can lower down to 0.4 mV dec−1, significantly outperforming the fundamental thermionic limit (40 mV dec−1). At the same time, the leakage current (Ig) is less than 1 pA, which is negligible compared to the corresponding channel currents (Fig. 11c inset). Moreover, the as-fabricated IIT device exhibits excellent switching characteristics: (i) even after 10000 switching cycles, the SS remains stable and the gate threshold voltage fluctuates within 0.5 V; (ii) a fast switching-off mechanism is required to avoid undesired hysteresis (Fig. 11d). The typical hysteresis window is usually less than 0.5 V when <1% of the Vbg is applied, and the SS is pretty low when the device changes from the ON state to the OFF state (Fig. 11e), which can be mainly attributed to the excellent hysteresis behavior and intimate interface between the InSe and BP layers. The robustness of the IIT can be well reflected by the noise feature. The current noise as a function of the frequency at different back gate voltages in Fig. 11f demonstrates that all the low-noise spectra have a typical 1/f power density,241 and the spectra can be divided into two parts: a high-noise part (ON state) and a low-noise region (OFF state). It can also be seen in Fig. 11f that the noise increases with the Vbg (bottom four lines) before avalanche breakdown, while it saturates after avalanche breakdown (top four lines), indicating that extra noise does not occur during carrier multiplication. Additionally, in 2019, Jiang et al.17 fabricated a symmetric tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) using the MoS2/BP/MoS2 heterostructure as the channel material. The schematic and optical microscope image of the top-gate TFET can be seen in Fig. 11g and h, respectively. The TFET channel is composed of two thin MoS2 NSs (2–3 nm) and one thick BP NS (60–70 nm), and dual gate geometry has been utilized for electrostatic gate control. The combination of the MoS2 NSs and the p-type semiconducting BP NS makes the formation of a small tunneling barrier width with efficient carrier tunneling.242,243 2D BP was chosen as the p-type semiconductor in this n-p-n heterojunction due to its smaller bandgap compared to other 2D materials184,244,245 and lower electron affinity (EA), while MoS2 acted as the n-type semiconductor in the channel due to its higher EA as compared to the other extensively explored TMDCs.245 The EA, bandgap, and work function of bulk BP crystal were calculated to be 4.10, 0.3, and 5.0 eV, respectively (Fig. 11i), and the EA, bandgap, and work function of MoS2 thin film were 4.30, 1.82, and 4.5 eV (Fig. 11i), respectively. This symmetric MoS2/BP/MoS2 heterostructure has low tunneling barrier heights, which can provide a solid basis for efficient carrier tunneling with low operation voltages. The Id–top-gate voltage (Vtg) transfer characteristic of the top-gate MoS2/BP/MoS2 heterostructure-based device in Fig. 11j indicates that a remarkably smaller SS of 58.4 mV dec−1 has been achieved in the current range of ∼10−10 to 10−8 A. It should be pointed out that the Id has a linear relationship with Vd at a low voltage level (Fig. 11j inset), which is similar to the back-gate individual MoS2-based FET and TFET.17 The output characteristics of the device in Fig. 11k show that a clear linear and saturation region can be observed, indicating a significantly enhanced gate control over the channel with sufficiently suppressed short-channel effects. This MoS2/BP/MoS2 heterostructure-based TFET shows an attractive pathway to new designs of fast-speed and low-power nanoelectronic devices based on 2D BP.

In addition, functional 2D BP nanostructures play an essential role in the field of photoelectronics such as in photodetectors and photodiodes, due to their suitable bandgap, excellent stability, etc.1,9,16,60,240,246–248 In 2020, Afzal et al.1 developed a novel van der Waals heterostructure photodiode based on 2D BP and 2D n-PdSe2, which established tunable and excellent photoresponsivity and rectification. The schematic illustration of the 2D p-BP/2D n-PdSe2 heterostructure-based diode can be seen in Fig. 12a. In order to study the effect of wavelengths on the 2D p-BP/2D n-PdSe2 heterojunction-based diode, Ids–Vds curves were recorded to measure the forward and reverse currents under laser light of different wavelengths (λ = 532, 1064, and 1310 nm). It can be seen that the photocurrent decreases with increase of light wavelength (Fig. 12b), which is also evidenced by the result presented in Fig. 12c. High photocurrent values of 3.54 × 10−6 and 8.54 × 10−8 A μm−1 in the visible (λ = 532 nm) and NIR regions (λ = 1310 nm) can be obtained, respectively. The excellent photodetection in the NIR region of the as-fabricated p-BP/n-PdSe2 heterostructure-based device can be mainly ascribed to the interlayer optical transition of charge carriers between the conduction band minimum (CBM) of 2D PdSe2 and the valence band maximum (VBM) of 2D BP.1 The response time (rise time, τres, and decay time, τrec) of the 2D BP/2D n-PdSe2 heterostructure-based diode as a function of wavelength (Fig. 12d) indicates that it presents a large quantity of charge carriers and fast photoresponse (1.6/4.7 ms). The considerably shorter response time can be observed at higher wavelengths (irradiated by light from the near IR region) because the photocarriers (electrons–holes) are efficiently separated by the interlayer transition in the 2D BP/2D n-PdSe2 heterostructure-based diode. More importantly, the comparison of the photoresponsivity and detectivity of the 2D BP/2D n-PdSe2 heterostructure-based diode and other reported devices at different wavelengths (Fig. 12e and f) illustrates that the 2D BP/2D n-PdSe2 heterostructure-based diode presents superior photoresponsivity and photodetectivity to 2D BP,249 2D MoS2,250 2D PdSe2,251 or other heterostructure-based devices,252–254 and has distinct prospect for optoelectronic and energy-harvesting devices. Moreover, a heterostructure fabricated by van der Waals assembly of 2D BP and 2D MoS2 was also prepared for high-performance NIR photodetectors.9 Current is generated when Vds is applied across the two electrodes through the heterostructure channel, and can be easily tuned by simply applying drain voltage (Vg) into the p+ doped Si as the back gate (Fig. 12g). The photoresponsivity and photocurrent of the 2D BP/2D MoS2 heterostructure illuminated using a 1550 nm laser at a Vds of 3 V demonstrate that the heterostructure reaches the highest photoresponsivity of 153.4 mA W−1 at a light intensity of 1 nW and exhibits the highest photocurrent of ∼1.38 μA (Fig. 12h). The dependence of the photoresponse on time at different Vgs reveals the rise in photocurrent under 1550 nm laser and its fast decay after the immediate removal of the laser (Fig. 12i). A typical τres of 15 μs and a τrec of 70 μs were obtained, both of which were significantly smaller than those of reported heterojunctions based on graphene, respectively.255–258

3.3 Catalysis
Although 2D BP has promising application prospects for photo/electrocatalysis due to its unique properties, the issues of instability and low catalysis efficiency are two bottlenecks that urgently need to be resolved. Recently, massive efforts have been devoted to adjusting its electronic properties, charge separation, and intrinsic structure by structure engineering, such as surface modification or hybridization with other nanomaterials, for enhanced photo/electrocatalytic performance.4,11,20,32,71,102,103,112,191,193,259–262 As the solar energy absorption and redox ability are predominately determined by the bandgap width and conduction/valence edge position of 2D BP, modulating the band structure of 2D BP makes sense for efficiently improving the photocatalysis activity. For example, in 2020, Zhu et al.4 successfully synthesized a hydroxyl-modified monolayer BP (M-BP-OH) via a facile exfoliation method assisted by liquid nitrogen for CO2 reduction. Density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations are conducted on the reaction pathways for revealing the photocatalytic mechanism, as shown in Fig. 13a. Two consecutive steps of proton–electron coupling with two intermediates, *COOH and *CO were proposed: (i) the formation of both COOH* and CO* (highly endothermic process); (ii) the formation of COOH* intermediate (rate-limiting step). Note that M-BP-OH has a lower formation energy of COOH* and CO* compared to bulk BP (Fig. 13a), suggesting that the reaction kinetics can be speeded up after hydroxyl modification of 2D BP. It can be ascribed to the fact that M-BP-OH has more negative CB sites and electron accumulation, which promotes a quick transfer of massive electrons to CO2 to promote the activation of CO2 molecule, and thereby diminishes the energy barrier.4 The CO2 reduction activities (Fig. 13b) and stabilities (Fig. 13c) of different functional group (–OH, –NH2, and –F) modified BP monolayer NSs demonstrate that M-BP-OH displays the best activity and stability. Besides, the stability measurements of M-BP and M-BP-OH were also carried out by TEM, AFM, and XPS, revealing that the stability of M-BP-OH remained almost unchanged after a predetermined time (1, 10, or 30 days) while a majority of M-BP was oxidized, confirming the excellent stability of the as-prepared M-BP-OH. Both experimental results and DFT show that the lone pair electrons of P element can be well utilized after the introduction of the hydroxyl group, which significantly enhances the stability of the monolayer BP.4 Moreover, in 2020, Shao et al.11 reported a 2D MXene Ti3C2Tx-decorated 2D BP heterostructure (Ti3C2Tx/TiO2-BP) synthesized by a hydrothermal method for improved visible-light photocatalytic activity, in which TiO2 was formed in the synthetic process. Ti3C2Tx/TiO2-BP samples with Ti3C2Tx/TiO2 to BP weight ratios of 5, 10, and 15 are abbreviated as TCTBP-5, TCTBP-10, and TCTBP-15, respectively. For comparison, pure Ti3C2Tx/TiO2 (TCT) was also fabricated without 2D BP under the same conditions. Based on previously reported literature, MXenes were popular in photocatalysis due to some prominent properties: (i) the suitable carrier migration in MXene systems; (ii) the tunable band gap of MXenes; (iii) the excellent light absorbance of MXenes; (iv) the massive terminal groups on the MXene surface.203,263–265 The photocatalytic behavior of the as-synthesized Ti3C2Tx/TiO2-BP was evaluated from the photodegradation of the organic pollutant rhodamine B (RhB) under visible-light irradiation, as shown in Fig. 13d. Ti3C2Tx/TiO2-BP samples with different Ti3C2Tx/TiO2 contents not only show higher adsorption capacity for RhB than individual Ti3C2Tx/TiO2 or 2D BP, but exhibit higher adsorption capacity for RhB as the Ti3C2Tx/TiO2 content increases, i.e., TCTBP-15 (99.09%) > TCTBP-10 (98.25%) > TCTBP-5 (90.94%), which could be attributed to the significantly enhanced adsorption capacity originating from the inherent properties (more pores and active sites) of the heterostructure. In order to figure out the degree of mineralization of RhB, the total organic carbon (TOC) detection was performed for TCTBP-15, and the result shows that TCTBP-15 exhibits 83.4% mineralization efficiency for RhB under visible-light illumination for 60 min, as shown in Fig. 13e. In the meantime, the crystal structure of the TCTBP-15 heterostructure characterized by XRD (Fig. 13f) shows no apparent change after several cyclic photocatalytic experiments of RhB and another contaminant tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH). Because of their outstanding photodegradation efficiency and high photostability, it is expected that the synthesized Ti3C2Tx/TiO2-BP heterostructures have great potential for practical application in environmental remediation. In addition, in 2017, a novel binary heterostructure based on 2D BP and graphitic CN was rationally designed, facilely fabricated and used as a metal-free photocatalyst for H2 evolution.20 Photocatalytic H2 evolution using the as-prepared 2D BP/2D CN heterostructure was carried out in the presence of methanol which acts as a sacrificial electron donor to quench holes generated from band-gap excitation. Only a tiny amount of H2 could be detected under visible light irradiation when individual 2D BP or 2D CN was used as a photocatalyst (Fig. 13g), implying the fast recombination of photogenerated charges in pure BP or CN. However, for the 2D BP/2D CN heterostructure, the amount of H2 significantly increases with irradiation time and can reach up to 1.93 μmol under visible light irradiation for 3 h (Fig. 13g), verifying that the fabricated 2D BP/2D CN heterostructure can act as a high-efficiency metal-free photocatalyst for H2 evolution without any other cocatalysts. The photocatalytic stability of the 2D BP/2D CN heterostructure for H2 evolution suggests that continuous H2 evolution occurs without any noticeable degradation in the subsequent runs (Fig. 13h). It is noted that the catalysts after storing for two weeks still display excellent catalytic performance, indicating that the 2D BP/2D CN heterostructure is an ideal candidate for stable photocatalysis in H2 evolution. Moreover, it should be pointed out that the slight decrease of the photocatalytic performance during the cyclic photocatalytic experiments is mainly ascribed to the loss of catalysts during sample recovery by centrifugation. As we know, efficient charge separation/transfer has a great influence on the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance. Considering the band structures of 2D BP and 2D CN, a type I heterojunction is formed at their interface when 2D BP is closely attached on the 2D CN surface (Fig. 13i). When the 2D BP/2D CN heterostructure is irradiated with light of wavelength more than 420 nm, 2D CN is easily excited to generate electrons and holes in 2D CN, and 2D BP acts as an electron acceptor from the adjacent 2D CN which can efficiently prevent the recombination of the photogenerated charges in 2D CN. Here, the P–N coordinate bond acts as the trap site of electrons for efficient H2 generation, while holes in 2D BP are quickly quenched by methanol. When the 2D BP/2D CN heterostructure is irradiated with light of wavelength more than 780 nm, the excited electrons in the CB of 2D BP are trapped by interfacial P–N defects, and thus efficiently improve the photocatalytic performance. It is also anticipated that the 2D BP/2D CN heterostructure as a metal-free photocatalyst can shed light on new designs of high-performance photocatalysts for next-generation energy conversion systems.

Modifying 2D BP with heteroatoms or other nanomaterials to expose more active sites is an effective approach to improve the electrocatalytic activity of 2D BP.6,14,22,32,61,84,87,191,260–262,266,267 For example, in 2019, Liu et al.6 used 2D BP as a template to fabricate various metal doped phosphorenes such as Co-doped 2D BP (BP(Co)), Mo-doped 2D BP (BP(Mo)), and Ni-doped 2D BP (BP(Ni)) by a facile electrochemical strategy. The synthesis of BP(Co) was carried out using a home-made electrochemical system, which was composed of a platinum foil anode and a bulk BP cathode placed in parallel in the H-type electrolytic cell with Nafion 211 as the separation membrane (Fig. 14a). The electrocatalytic performances of bare BP and BP(metal) were investigated by evaluating the HER activity in 0.5 M H2SO4. The samples were prepared by depositing bare BP or BP(metal) on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) as the cathode. The electrocatalytic performances of bare BP and BP(metal) show that all BP(metal) electrodes have evidently higher electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) than bare BP (Fig. 14b). The Tafel slopes of BP(Co), BP(Mo), BP(Ni), and bare 2D BP are 107, 112, 116, and 182 mV dec−1, respectively (Fig. 14c). Larger Tafel slopes (>40 mV dec−1) indicate a Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism of the H2 evolution, and the smallest Tafel slope obtained from BP(Co) manifests the fastest HER kinetics. DFT calculations were also performed to understand the mechanism of the improved HER activity of BP(metal). The free energies of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH*) of the optimal HER site of each surface show that hydrogen adsorption on the bare BP has the largest positive ΔGH* of 1.29 eV, which is distinctly larger than that of BP(metal) (Fig. 14d). The overall calculated trend of the HER activity is in good agreement with the experimental HER results. In particular, ΔGH* of BP(Co) is 0.01 eV, which is the nearest to the optimal ΔGH* (0 eV) among all of the BP(metal). This effective strategy provides an alternative platform for the preparation of 2D BP-based high-performance electrocatalysts, and offers an efficient solution for structural modulation of 2D materials. Furthermore, in 2019, Shi et al.14 reported a 2D BP/0D Co3O4 NP heterostructure by coupling 0D Co3O4 NPs with 2D BP, as a stable and efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Fig. 14e presents the structural illustration of the 2D BP/0D Co3O4 NP heterostructure and the proposed mechanism of the OER. It was demonstrated that electron migration from 2D BP to 0D Co3O4 NPs was achieved in the 2D BP/0D Co3O4 NP heterostructure due to the higher Fermi level of BP compared to that of Co3O4, leading to efficient electron transfer. It can not only create abundant active sites with massive Co2+ but also efficiently prevents the degradation of 2D BP. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves show that the 2D BP/0D Co3O4 NP heterostructure exhibits dramatically improved electrocatalytic activity compared to 2D BP NSs, 0D Co3O4 NPs, and bare GCE (Fig. 14f), verifying that engineering the electronic structure of the heterostructure is essential for the excellent OER activity. Besides, the Tafel slope values obtained from the polarization curves were analyzed to understand the intrinsic OER kinetic behavior of the catalysts, as shown in Fig. 14g. A value of 63 mV dec−1 for the 2D BP/0D Co3O4 NP heterostructure is obtained, which is much lower than those of Co3O4 (128 mV dec−1) and BP (92 mV dec−1), indicating that the OER of the 2D BP/0D Co3O4 NP heterostructure is dominated by the chemical reaction for the formation of the O–O bond, while electron transfer is no longer the major step to suppress the OER performance of the heterostructure (Fig. 14g). The electronic structure modulation and kinetic mechanism of the 2D BP/0D Co3O4 NP heterostructure for OER reactions in this work are also expected to provide fundamental guidance on the new designs of 2D BP-based electrocatalysts for high-efficiency water oxidation. Additionally, in 2018, Wang et al.22 used Co2P nanocrystals for selective growth on the 2D BP edges to form the in-plane 2D BP/0D Co2P nanocrystal heterostructures for electrocatalysis. The proposed reaction mechanism of the in-plane 2D BP/0D Co2P nanocrystal heterostructures can be seen in Fig. 14h. As we know, the defects are necessarily produced on the BP NSs in the process of LPE, which result in a number of unsaturated P atoms with a smaller coordination number, and more the lone electrons, better the reducing activity. Besides, it should be noted that the surface adsorption energy (−4.41 eV) is significantly higher than the defect occupation energy of Co (−7.65 eV), suggesting that Co ions are facilely reduced to Co atoms on the defect sites of 2D BP. Because the unsaturated P and defects are usually abundant on the BP edges,268 the formation of Co2P nanocrystals tends to occur at the BP edges.22Fig. 14i shows that the Tafel slopes of the as-prepared in-plane 2D BP/0D Co2P nanocrystal heterostructures are 62 and 72 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively, both of which are less than those of BP (125 and 188 mV dec−1). Furthermore, the HER stability in Fig. 14j shows that the current density remains constant in 0.5 M H2SO4 and retains 81% of its initial current density in 1.0 M KOH after electrolysis for 24 h, revealing the excellent stability of the 2D BP/0D Co2P nanocrystal heterostructure. Interestingly, the OER activities in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. 14k) show a smaller Tafel slope of 78 mV dec−1 for the heterostructure compared to that of pure BP, indicating its superior activity in the OER. This work can pave the way to new designs of high-performance 2D BP-based devices by utilization of BP defects to explore their versatile applications.

3.4 Sensors
Few-layer 2D BP is regarded as a promising sensing material owing to its unique structure and outstanding physicochemical properties. To further exploit the sensing performance, extensive efforts have been dedicated to the design and fabrication of functional 2D BP nanostructure-based sensors, such as gas sensors,93,105,106,130,269 biosensors,89,104,199,270,271 strain sensors,192 electrochemical sensors,272,273 aptasensors,274,275etc. For example, 0D Au NPs were in situ reduced on the surface of 2D BP NSs to form 2D BP/0D Au NP heterostructures for fluorescence immunochromatographic sensors (FICSs).104 The schematic diagram of the synthetic procedure of the 2D BP/0D Au NP heterostructure and the fabrication of a home-made fluorescence quenching immunochromatographic sensor based on this heterostructure can be seen in Fig. 15a. The quenching abilities of 0D Au NPs, 2D BP NSs, and the as-fabricated 2D BP/0D Au NP heterostructure at λ = 525 nm show that all of the samples display linearly increased quenching rates with their concentrations (Fig. 15b), which is a prerequisite for a nanomaterial to be applied in a quenching probe. However, it should be noted that the quenching rate of the 2D BP/0D Au NP heterostructure can reach up to 73.8%, which is 1.73-fold and 1.44-fold higher than that of 0D Au NPs (42.6%) and 2D BP NSs (51.2%), respectively, indicating that the heterostructure can dramatically improve the fluorescence quenching ability. From the viewpoint of practical applications, the 2D BP/0D Au NP heterostructure was used as a quenching probe for the detection of zearalenone (ZEN) in a pure working buffer under UV lamp (Fig. 15c) and natural light (Fig. 15d) irradiation. Green fluorescence can be observed in the T-line region at 0.1 μg L−1 of ZEN under UV light irradiation for the 2D BP/0D Au NP heterostructure-based FICS (Fig. 15c), suggesting that the limit of detection (LOD) of the developed FICS is 0.1 μg L−1 under UV light irradiation, while the brown band of the T-line gradually disappears until the concentration of ZEN reaches 1 μg L−1, indicating that the LOD of the developed FICS is 1 μg L−1 under natural light irradiation (Fig. 15d). Regardless of the detection under UV light or natural light irradiation, both LODs for the 2D BP/0D Au NP heterostructure are significantly lower than those of Au NPs, respectively, which can be mainly due to the fact that the sheet-like structure of the 2D BP/0D Au NP heterostructure offers an outstanding quenching ability and antibody loading capacity. The 2D BP/0D Au NP heterostructure provides a novel and effective application of 2D BP NSs for high-sensitive detection of ZEN or other pollutants in foods. In addition, in 2020, a highly sensitive dual-modal temperature and strain sensor based on 2D BP NSs and 2D laser-engraved graphene was rationally designed and facilely fabricated to easily tune e-skin sensing functionality.192Fig. 15e shows the schematic diagram of the preparation of the 2D BP/2D laser-engraved graphene heterostructure-based sensor. The heterostructure was fabricated by laser engraving of polyimide, followed by the surface coating of 2D BP NSs. Here, polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene was employed as a substrate material to achieve high stretchability, high cycling stability, elastic recovery, and solution processability of the material. The temperature-dependent capacity of the as-prepared sensor monitored by using hot water at 38.5 °C and cold water at 25 °C in sequence for 10 cycles shows that the resistance of the temperature sensor sharply increases and then goes back without noticeable hysteresis (Fig. 15f), indicating that this heterostructure-based sensor has great potential to be applied into e-skin for tracking the body temperature. When the device was closely attached to the arm, the body temperature could be instantaneously detected with point-of-care resistance change. Considering the subject's body temperature (≈36.5 °C) as the reference temperature, the sensor can successfully respond and return to the original baseline (Fig. 15g). The sensor mounted to a subject's extensor muscle of the forearm by using a commercial medical bandage can also be seen (Fig. 15g inset). The time-dependent resistance response of the 2D BP/2D laser-engraved graphene heterostructure-based sensor subsequently measured at a strain range of 2% to 20% (Fig. 15h) shows that the sensor response monotonically increases with strain and quickly recovers after strain release, and a magnified version of the smaller strains of 2% (black line) and 5% (pink line) can also be seen in Fig. 15h inset. Moreover, in 2020, Gui et al.275 developed a novel 2D BP NSs/metal–organic framework (MOF) hybrid-based aptasensor for precise capture and ratiometric electrochemical detection of miR3123. It was demonstrated that the home-made aptasensor was rationally designed and successfully fabricated to detect miRNAs (miR3123) by an electrochemical dual-signal ratiometric method (ratiometric electrochemical aptasensor), which had advantages of high detection sensitivity of electrochemical sensors and high accuracy of dual-signal ratiometric detection of miRNAs. Besides, in 2020, Gui et al.274 elaborately assembled Mn-doped Ni-based metal–organic frameworks (Mn-MOF) with 3D hierarchical flower-like superstructures with 2D BP NSs to prepare a novel 2D/3D BPNSs/Mn-MOF nanocomposite, which was directly coupled with a methylene blue (MB)-labeled DNA aptamer for fabricating an electrochemical aptasensor. The as-prepared aptasensor was successfully used to determine stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) in practical human serum samples, which exhibited high detection recoveries and low relative standard deviation (RSD), verifying that this BPNSs/Mn-MOF-based aptasensor has excellent reliability and practicability for STIP1 detection. It is concluded that this highly sensitive dual-modal temperature and strain sensor platform based on the 2D BP/2D laser-engraved graphene heterostructure can provide unique opportunities for a variety of applications, such as robotic appendages, e-skin, and health monitoring technologies.

3.5 Nonlinear photonics
In recent years, few-layer 2D BP has shown great potential in the field of fundamental science and technology, and has been considered as a potential building block for advanced electronic technologies due to its unique properties.5,12,18,82,91,110,144,276–279 Recently, Liu et al.5 successfully synthesized perfluorinated gallium phthalocyanine (F16PcGa) axially grafted few-layer 2D BP NSs (F16PcGa-BP) for nonlinear optical and optical limiting response. A novel donor (D)–acceptor (A) system was employed for the synthesis of F16PcGa-BP by axially grafting F16PcGa (electron acceptor) onto the surface of 4-hydroxylbenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate functionalized BP (4-HBT-BP, electron donor) by the formation of a Ga–O bond (Fig. 16a). Intermolecular electron transfer events monitored by nanosecond or femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 16b) show that the maximum transient absorption of F16PcGa-BP (λ = 556 nm) red-shifts by around 46 nm compared to that of F16PcGa (λ = 510 nm), confirming the formation of F16PcGa*−–BP*+ radical ion pairs in this D–A system. In this study, the nonlinear optical (NLO) response of BP, F16PcGaCl and F16PcGa-BP in an optically nonactive and transparent poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) matrix at 532 nm by an open-aperture Z-scan technique from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser was studied (Fig. 16c). The NLO responses of BP, F16PcGaCl, and F16PcGa-BP indicate that F16PcGa-BP shows remarkably superior NLO response to BP and F16PcGaCl under the same conditions (Fig. 16d), which can be mainly attributed to the enhancement of the intramolecular transition dipole moment between the excited states in the electronic transition. Besides, it can also be found that the F16PcGa-BP/PMMA film displays a superior limiting threshold of 0.44 GW cm−2 (2.64 J cm−2), compared to F16PcGaCl/PMMA film (1.54 GW cm−2 or 9.24 J cm−2) and BP/PMMA film (Fig. 16e). This work suggests that F16PcGa-BP can be a potential NOL candidate for protecting human eyes, optical sensors, and optoelectronic and photonic devices from strong laser light in the visible regime, and opens opportunities for more practical applications of functional 2D BP nanostructures. Moreover, in 2020, our group12 successfully synthesized a 2D BP/2D graphene heterostructure by an LPE method for ultrafast photonics. The configuration of the pulsed laser or ultrashort pulsed laser based on the as-prepared 2D BP/2D graphene heterostructure as a saturable absorber (SA) can be seen in Fig. 16f. The stable continuous wave mode locked pulses based on the heterostructure dispersion show that the optical spectrum of mode-locked pulses is centered at 1529.92 nm and 3 dB spectral width is 3.4 nm (Fig. 16g). It can be observed that the mode-locked repetition rate of the strong signal peak is 7.43 MHz and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is about 52 dB (Fig. 16h). The fabrication by stacking different 2D materials via this facile approach sheds new light on new designs of multifunctional heterostructures with desirable photonic properties. Additionally, in order to efficiently avoid the oxidation and degradation of BP, a BP-polymer composite film was elaborately designed by encapsulating an optically transparent polymer matrix onto 2D BP NSs as an NLO material for high energy pulse generation.18 Electrospinning was utilized to prepare a robust polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-functionalized 2D BP nanofiber network to make a uniformly distributed polymer-functionalized 2D BP nanostructure (Fig. 16i). The result of pulse generation with PVP-functionalized 2D BP NS-based SA demonstrates that the typical pulse train presents uniform intensity distribution with a repetition rate of 23.48 kHz, corresponding to a time interval of 42.5 μs (Fig. 16j). Note that the uniform intensity distribution was achieved without modulation, suggesting that the as-prepared PVP-functionalized 2D BP nanostructures have excellent noise-suppressing capability. The radio-frequency (RF) spectrum shows that the SNR is over 53 dB (Fig. 16k), indicating the high quality of the output pulse. In addition to the fundamental and harmonic frequency, no other frequency components are observed in the RF spectrum with a broader span (Fig. 16k inset), verifying that the PVP-functionalized 2D BP has high stability in the Q-switched pulse generation. This work provides fundamental guidance on new designs of versatile functional nanostructures based on 2D BP for advanced photonic and optoelectronic applications.

3.6 Biomedical applications
2D BP NSs are capable of loading drugs, photosensitizers, magnetic nanoparticles, etc., due to the high surface area and negative charge, and have been considered as a new type of inorganic material for biomedicines because of their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and biosafety.42,140,280–282 Despite the recent advances in 2D BP-based therapeutic systems, there are still many problems that need to be solved to meet the demand of clinical applications, such as in vivo toxicity,283 excretion,284 stability,50,51,285etc. In order to satisfy the requirements for practical applications, functional 2D BP nanostructures by modifying 2D BP NSs with heteroatoms or other nanomaterials, such as self-recognition protein CD47-modified 2D BP,286 polyethylene glycol-amine (PEG-NH2)-modified 2D BP,3 polydopamine-modified 2D BP,69 cellulose/2D BP hydrogel,100 2D BP/0D Ag NP heterostructure,72 2D BP/2D MXene Ti3C2Tx heterostructure,199etc., were successfully fabricated to further improve the therapeutic effects of BP-based nanosystems. In 2018, our group proposed a new strategy of light activation of 2D BP NSs in hydrogel nanostructures for cancer therapy.2Fig. 17a shows the schematic diagram of the working principle of a BP NS-containing hydrogel named BP@hydrogel, which can be employed to easily tune the release of anticancer drugs under NIR irradiation. Here, 2D BP NSs as a photothermal transducing agent, converts NIR light to thermal energy and gradually increases the temperature of the BP@hydrogel under NIR irradiation, and the reversible hydrolysis and softening of the agarose hydrogel occur as the temperature increases, resulting in an accelerated diffusion of drugs from the BP@hydrogel matrix to the microenvironment. The photothermal stability and temperature-dependent effect on the release of doxorubicin (DOX) from the BP@hydrogel (Fig. 17b) show that the release of DOX remarkably increases under NIR irradiation, compared to the DOX concentration without irradiation. In order to understand the cytotoxicity of 2D BP NSs, four types of human cells, MDA-MB-231 (human breast cancer cells), A549 (A549 human lung carcinoma cells), HeLa (human cervical cancer cell), and B16 (mouse melanoma cells), were cultured with Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 medium containing different concentrations of 2D BP NSs for 48 h. The result demonstrates that all cells show no obvious cytotoxicity even at a high concentration (200 μg mL−1) (Fig. 17c). After intratumor injection of BP@hydrogel, the tumor temperature of the mice monitored using a thermal camera dramatically increases with the irradiation time (Fig. 17d). More importantly, an in vivo antitumor study to testify the improved therapy of cancer was carried out, and the tumor-bearing nude mice were treated as follows: group 1, with saline (control); group 2, with DOX only; group 3, with BP@hydrogel only; and group 4, with BP@hydrogel under NIR irradiation. It can be observed in Fig. 17e that the tumor size of the BP@hydrogel with NIR irradiation group was dramatically smaller than those of the other three groups, indicating that the NIR irradiation-controlled, DOX-loaded BP@hydrogel-based drug has an outstanding tumor ablation effect in vivo. Moreover, there is no significant effect on the body weights of nude mice, verifying that adverse effects are negligible in this system (Fig. 17f). To further validate the in vivo toxicity of BP@hydrogel, major organs of the mice were sliced and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histology analysis. The results show that the treated mice after BP@hydrogel injection with NIR irradiation present no remarkable damage to the normal tissues (Fig. 17g), confirming that BP@hydrogel treatment is nearly harmless to the normal tissues. It is anticipated that the BP@hydrogel drug delivery platform can not only expand the application fields of 2D BP, but also has great potential for the treatment of cancer tumor.

Apart from that, in 2017, a theranostic delivery platform based on PEG-modified 2D BP NSs was studied for its biological activities, and applied to cancer therapy (Fig. 18a).3 The 2D BP NSs fabricated by a modified LPE method were functionalized with positively charged PEG-NH2 through electrostatic interaction to enhance their biocompatibility and physiological stability. The loading capacity of DOX for BP-PEG NSs shows that the DOX/BP NS feeding ratio almost linearly increases and saturates at a DOX/2D BP NS feeding ratio of about 3 (Fig. 18b). It was found that the saturation loading of DOX could reach up to ≈108%, which was significantly higher than that of many conventional nanomaterial-based systems for drug loading (10–30%).287,288 Because the BP-PEG NSs were eventually accumulated in the lysosomes for degradation, the dose of BP-PEG NSs can be further diminished by simply suppressing the activities of lysosomes and autophagy. In this regard, chloroquine (CQ), a lysosome tropic agent that can efficiently inhibit endosomal acidification, block the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and disrupt lysosomes,289 was used. As expected, the HeLa cell viability in groups treated with the combination of NIR, CQ, and DOX shows the best performance due to the synergistic effect (Fig. 18c). Besides, a whole-animal NIR imaging strategy was used to trace the dynamic change of fluorescent BP-PEG NSs and the tumor accumulation, as shown in Fig. 18d. Strong fluorescence signals can be observed in both groups (G1: BP-PEG/Cy7 NSs; G2: BP-PEG-FA/Cy7 NSs), suggesting that BP-PEG NSs have good tumor accumulation through the blood circulation and an improved permeability retention effect. It is noted that stronger signals of the G2 group compared to the G1 group further demonstrate that G2 has greater potential in NIR bio-imaging. The ex vivo study of the excised organs after 24 h intravenous injection shows that a majority of the fluorescence signal remains in the liver, lung and kidney, in good agreement with the excellent long circulation.3 Moreover, the BP-PEG NS theranostic delivery platform was used for an in vivo antitumor study to evaluate the improved cancer therapy using the HeLa tumor, as shown in Fig. 18e. All three groups, DOX (chemotherapy control group), BP-PEG-FA/DOX NSs (chemotherapy with delivery platform group), and BP-PEG-FA NSs + NIR (PTT group), show decreasing tumor growth in mice compared with saline. Additionally, the BP-PEG-FA/DOX NSs and BP-PEG-FA NSs + NIR display better therapeutic effect compared with the DOX, indicating the promising applications of BP-PEG NSs as drug carriers and PTT agents. Note that both BP-PEG-FA NSs + CQ + NIR (PTT + biological response-induced therapy group) and BP-PEG-FA/DOX NSs + NIR + CQ (triple-response therapy group: chemotherapy + PTT + biological response induced therapy) present outstanding therapeutic effect, demonstrating that the improved antitumor effect of BP-PEG NSs has been successfully achieved by this synergetic therapy strategy. At the end of the treatment for two weeks, all nude mice were euthanized and the studied tumors were collected. It can be found in Fig. 18f that no tissue damage is observed in the major organs in all of the experimental groups as assessed by H&E staining (Fig. 18g), indicating that the BP-PEG NS theranostic delivery platform has great potential in in vivo applications.

4. Conclusion and outlook
Since the first discovery of 2D BP in 2014, it has stimulated great research interest in many fields, such as energy and storage conversion, (opto)electronics, catalysis, sensors, nonlinear photonics, and biomedical applications, due to its tunable direct bandgap, high charge mobility, wide optical absorption, etc. To further broaden its application beyond its current boundaries and further develop its potential, functional 2D BP nanostructures such as surface-modified 2D BP and mixed-dimensional 2D BP-based heterostructures have been elaborately designed and successfully synthesized by versatile techniques for next-generation devices with high device performance and excellent stability. In summary, this review updates recent advances in the controlled synthesis and diverse applications of functional 2D BP nanostructures. However, functional 2D BP nanostructures, advanced nanoarchitectures based on 2D BP, are still at the infancy stage with much potential that needs to be exploited. We summarized and discussed recent functional 2D BP nanostructures to pave the way to new designs of next-generation advanced 2D BP nanostructure-based systems, and the major challenges and developments in the synthesis and applications of functional 2D BP nanostructures are also provided as follows:
(1) One thorny problem for BP is its easy degradation when exposed to ambient atmosphere, which is the critical bottleneck that hampers its practical application in many fields. Therefore, it is still of great value to develop functional 2D BP nanostructures with both excellent device performance and high stability under ambient conditions, such as FP and metal ion-doped 2D BP,46,48 to meet the growing demand of next-generation devices.
(2) The controlled synthesis of well-defined functional 2D BP nanostructures (tunable interlayer spacing, specific layer number, and diversified functional groups) plays an important part in understanding the structure–property relationship of functional 2D BP nanostructures. Therefore, facile, low-cost, eco-friendly, and large-scale synthesis of well-defined functional 2D BP nanostructures is still very essential to move forward.
(3) In situ characterizations, such as in situ TEM, in situ AFM, etc., have a great influence on the real-time monitoring of the structural evolution of functional 2D BP nanostructure-based devices, such as sensors and photodetectors, which can provide fundamental guidance on the advanced performance of functional 2D BP nanostructures.
(4) Theoretical simulation is an effective and practical way to understand the basic properties of functional 2D BP nanostructures, which is of great significance to predict their properties (e.g., structural, electronic, optoelectronic and magnetic properties) for the performance optimization of functional 2D BP nanostructure-based devices.
(5) Assembled nanoarchitectures with secondary 2D BP-related nanostructures are very vital to significantly enhance the performance in energy and storage conversion and catalysis. Well-defined 2D BP-based nanostructures (loaded model, sandwiched model, encapsulated model, etc.) with elaborate designs could well resolve many challenges in new-generation 2D BP nanostructure-based devices.
(6) As for 2D BP-based heterojunction integration in the applications of (opto)electronics (FETs and photodetectors) and optics (ultrafast laser), van der Waals integration is usually used which offers a facile integration strategy without chemical bonds for excellent performance of the 2D BP-based heterostructures. However, the surface contamination, uniformity, and transferring process rely on manual operation proficiency to a great extent, which makes it still challenging for realizing scalable production of the advanced device based on 2D BP-related heterostructures. Therefore, it is of great value to develop van der Waals integration with various dimensions, extremely clean and electronically sharp interfaces.
(7) Functional 2D BP nanostructures are still in their infancy in the field of biomedical applications. Although the size and surface modification of nanomaterials have a great influence on regulating the biological behaviour of functional 2D BP nanostructures, their relationships with other factors, i.e., systematic cytotoxicity, transport pathways, and biological immunity, have yet to be systematically studied. Therefore, more in-depth exploitation of the expertise and clinical transformation of functional 2D BP nanostructures require extensive contributions from specialists in all walks of life, i.e., biomedical scientists, pharmacologists, chemical researchers, and industrial sectors.
(8) The exploitation of only one single performance (catalysis or detection) of 2D BP-based nanomaterials is far from meeting the growing demand of multifunctional devices. The exploitation of multifunctional 2D BP-based nanomaterials is an emerging field for multidisciplinary applications because of the inherent fascinating properties. The vast exploration of multidisciplinary applications of 2D BP nanostructures or functional 2D BP nanostructures is very exciting and promising for the comprehensive improvement of 2D BP-based devices.
From an overall viewpoint, functional 2D BP nanostructures are emerging but appealing materials for a variety of applications. There are many opportunities for a wide range of researchers to study and develop the controlled synthesis, fundamental properties, and diverse applications of the fascinating functional materials. With abundant and burgeoning efforts in the future, we believe that functional 2D BP nanostructures can achieve rapid development and satisfy the growing demand of next-generation devices.
