    , Accepted 18th January 2022First published on 18th January 2022AbstractTransition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) have been well-established as ideal low-dimensional systems for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Strategies toward improving the activity of these TMC photocatalysts by crafting heterostructures have been intensively studied. In this study, a two-dimensional (2D) CoAl layered double hydroxide (CoAl-LDH) has been assembled on 2D TMCs (CdIn2S4, In2S3, and ZnIn2S4) to construct novel 2D/2D heterostructures by a facile electrostatic assembly method. The intimate interaction at the interface of hybrids and the suitable energy level alignment enable an efficient pathway for electron transfer to improve the photoactivity. Experimental results show that the photocatalytic activity of the CdIn2S4@CoAl-LDH hybrids for H2 production is about 4.3 times higher than that of CdIn2S4 nanosheets under visible-light irradiation. The effect of 2D CoAl-LDH on enhancing the photoactivities of In2S3 and ZnIn2S4 by similarly constructing 2D heterostructures has also been determined. This work establishes a foundation to construct 2D TMC-based heterostructures using CoAl-LDH nanosheets toward enhanced photoredox activity.
1. Introduction
Photocatalysis using semiconductor materials has been considered as a green approach for hydrogen production.1 In this realm, a large number of semiconductor materials have been explored, such as metal oxides,2 metal sulfides,2,3 Bi-based photocatalysts,4,5 Ag-based photocatalysts,6 and g-C3N4.7 Of particular note are the transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs: In2S3, CdS, CdIn2S4, ZnIn2S4, etc.), which possess desirable characteristics, such as adjustable direct band gap and wide optical absorption range, representing a family of visible light-responsive photocatalysts with promising performances for H2 evolution.8–12 On the other hand, their photocatalytic activity is limited by the high bulk recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and the deficiency of active sites. In this regard, the state-of-the-art approach to boost the photocatalytic performance is constructing TMC-based hybrid photocatalyst systems. By combining the advantages of each component and the associated synergistic effects, multiple contact interfaces and electron transfer paths can be constructed for the efficient transfer of photogenerated carriers to reduce the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers,8,13 thereby boosting the solar conversion efficiency.
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which are represented by the general formula, [M1−x2+Mx3+(OH2)]x+(An−)x/n ·mH2O (M represents divalent/trivalent heterogeneous metal cations and A represents an interlayer anion), are a family of two-dimensional (2D) inorganic layered compounds.14,15 They consist of brucite-like positively charged layers, counter anions between the layers to ensure charge neutrality, and interlayer water molecules.16,17 Notably, LDHs can be delaminated into positively charged single-layer nanosheets when they are dispersed in highly polar solvents, such as acrylates, formamide, butanol, N,N-dimethyl formamide–ethanol mixture and toluene, which are expected to be used as building blocks for the fabrication of various functional nanocomposites or nanostructures.18–20 LDH nanosheets have been widely studied due to their tunable band gap, low cost, relative ease of scale-up, and suitable band structures for driving water splitting.21–24 Among that, CoAl-LDH with a skeleton composed of uniformly distributed Co2+ and Al3+ is a promising photocatalyst due to its abundant Co active sites, which has been proven to be effective for a broad spectrum of applications, such as photodegradation,25 H2 production,26,27 and CO2 reduction.28
The face-to-face stacking of a 2D/2D heterojunction enables more intimate interfacial contact and better interfacial interaction compared with 0D/2D and 1D/2D heterojunctions.29,30 Therefore, the construction of a 2D/2D heterojunction is considered as an efficient route to facilitate the transfer and separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, thus improving photocatalytic performances.31,32 Notably, the dispersion of TMCs in deionized (DI) water displays a negatively charged surface due to the presence of an excess addition amount of S2− that has been adsorbed onto the material surface during the synthesis process.33,34 This offers the possibility for grafting CoAl-LDH on the surface of TMCs by an electrostatic self-assembly process. In this work, we report the fabrication of novel 2D/2D TMCs@CoAl-LDH (TMCs: CdIn2S4, In2S3, and ZnIn2S4) heterojunction photocatalysts by a facile electrostatic assembly method, in which intrinsic negatively charged TMC nanosheet (NS) and CoAl-LDH NS assembly units intimately interact with each other, affording efficient interfacial electron transfer pathways for photocatalysis. The binary photocatalysts without the addition of any noble metal cocatalysts exhibit boosted photocatalytic performances and photostability for H2 production compared to their single counterparts.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Indium chloride tetrahydrate (InCl3·4H2O, 99%) was obtained from Meryer Chemical Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. Zinc chloride (ZnCl2) and cadmium acetate dihydrate (Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O) were purchased from Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Thioacetamide (C2H5NS, TAA), formamide (CH3NO), cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), glycerol, and triethanolamine (C6H15NO3, TEOA) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). All materials were used as received without further treatment. Deionized water was used for the whole experiment.
2.2. Synthesis

2.2.1. Preparation of CdIn2S4 NSs. 
CdIn2S4 NSs were fabricated via a low-temperature refluxing method according to the previously reported literature.35 In detail, 1.5 mmol Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O and 3 mmol InCl3·4H2O were added into 250 ml of DI water and stirred for 30 min. Subsequently, an excess amount of TAA (8 mmol) was added into the above solution and stirred for another 30 min. The solution was then heated to 100 °C and maintained at that temperature for 12 h under vigorous stirring. The resultant yellowish sediment was rinsed with DI water and then freeze-dried under vacuum for 12 h.


2.2.2. Preparation of In2S3 NSs. 
In2S3 NSs were synthesized by a facile one-step refluxing method.36 250 mg of InCl3·4H2O was added into 100 mL of DI and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. Then 120 mg of TAA was added into the above solution and stirred for 30 min. The mixture was refluxed for 5 h at 95 °C under a N2 flow (60 mL min−1). After the reaction, the sample was cooled to room temperature and washed three times with DI water. The formed precipitate was freeze-dried for 24 h to obtain In2S3 NSs.


2.2.3. Preparation of ZnIn2S4 NSs. 
ZnIn2S4 NSs were synthesized according to the previously reported literature.37 Specifically, InCl3·4H2O (0.6 mmol), ZnCl2 (0.3 mmol) and TAA (1.6 mmol) were added consecutively into glycerol aqueous solution (40 mL, 20 v%, pH = 2) under stirring. The reaction mixture was then placed in an oil bath at 80 °C under stirring for 2 h. Upon cooling, the product was collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol three times, and dried under vacuum at 80 °C overnight.


2.2.4. Preparation of CoAl-LDH NSs. 
CoAl-LDH NSs were prepared by a cation exchange method according to the previously reported work.18 In detail, a 20.0 mL solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.032 M) and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (0.018 M) was added dropwise into an aqueous solution containing 23 v% formamide. The reaction was carried out at 80 °C with magnetic stirring, during which a solution of 0.25 M NaOH was added dropwise to maintain the system at a pH value of ca. 10. The reaction was completed within 10 min. After that, the prepared sample was centrifuged and washed with DI water. The sediments were dispersed in DI water eventually.


2.2.5. Synthesis of TMCs@CA composites by electrostatic assembly. 
TMCs@CA heterostructures were synthesized by an electrostatic self-assembly method. Typically, TMCs NSs were dispersed in water with a concentration of 1 mg mL−1 by ultrasonication. CoAl-LDH colloid (1 mg mL−1) was added dropwise to the as-prepared TMC nanosheet solution. Then the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min and the sediments were obtained at the bottom after allowing it to stand for a few hours. After that, the precipitate obtained was freeze-dried under vacuum for 12 h to obtain TMCs@CA heterostructures.

2.3. Materials characterization
A Zeta sizer Nano ZS-90 (Malvern, UK) apparatus was used to measure the zeta potential. The crystal structure was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns obtained on a MiniFlex 600 X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation, 40 kV accelerating voltage, 20 mA current, and 0.1° s−1 scan rate. The morphology was observed using an S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi, Japan). The microstructure was examined with a JEM 2010 EX transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Jeol, Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo Scientific AXIS SUPRA spectrometer, which was made of monochromatic Al Kα as the X-ray source, a hemispherical analyser, and a sample stage with multiaxial adjustability to obtain the surface composition of the samples. All of the binding energies were calibrated by the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) referenced by BaSO4 powders was recorded using a UV-2600 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Luminescence lifetimes were recorded using a single-photon counting spectrometer using a microsecond pulse lamp as an excitation source (375 nm). The data were analysed using the software supplied by Edinburgh Instruments.
2.4. Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical properties were investigated on a CHI 660E electrochemical station (Shanghai Chenhua, China) in a three-electrode quartz cell containing 40 mL of electrolyte, with a Pt plate (10 mm × 10 mm) and Ag/AgCl being employed as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. For preparing working electrodes, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was ultrasonically washed with ethanol for 30 min and dried at 333 K, onto which Scotch tape with a 0.25 cm2 round-shaped hole was stuck. 5 mg of the specimen was dispersed in 0.5 mL of water assisted by sonication to form a quasi steady suspension, which was then spread onto the hole left on the pretreated FTO glass. After drying naturally in air, the scotch tape was unstuck, and the uncoated section of the electrode was segregated with epoxy resin. A 300 W Xe lamp system (PLS-SXE300+, Beijing Perfect light Co., Ltd) equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter was used as the irradiation source. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were conducted with an electrolyte of 0.5 M KCl aqueous solution containing 0.01 M K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] (1:1) under open-circuit potential conditions. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were measured in the same electrolyte in a three electrode cell as that of EIS measurements. The cathodic polarization curves were obtained using the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) technique with a scan rate of 0.05 mV s−1 in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The open circuit photovoltage decay (OCP) measurements were conducted in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution by visible light irradiation for 60 s and then the subsequent decay of photovoltage was monitored for 50 s with the light turned off. Mott–Schottky (M–S) experiments were performed in 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution without an additive. Photocurrent densities were measured in 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution by visible light irradiation for 20 s and then the subsequent decay of photocurrent was monitored for 20 s with the light turned off.
2.5. Measurement of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
In a typical photocatalytic reaction, a 300 W Xe lamp system (PLS-SXE300+, Beijing Perfect light Co., Ltd) equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter was used as the irradiation source. 2 mg of the photocatalyst was suspended in a mixture consisting of 9 mL of distilled water and 1 mL of triethanolamine in a reaction cell. Before visible light illumination, the above suspension was stirred in the dark for 30 min under the continuous flux of Ar to remove the dissolved air. The incident light power density is 143.7 mW cm−2 as measured using a solar power meter which was placed at a distance of approximately 11 cm to the reactor. A continuous magnetic stirrer was applied at the bottom of the reactor in order to keep the photocatalyst in the suspension status. The photocatalytic reaction was typically performed for 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h, and 1 mL of reactive gas was sampled from the reactor with a syringe for analysis by using a gas chromatograph (GC-2014, 5 A molecular sieve column, TCD, Ar carrier). Under simulated sunlight (SSL) irradiation, a 300 W Xe lamp with an AM1.5G filter was used as the light source. The solar-light intensity was 1000 W m−2. The test conditions for a long-term experiment were similar to the above description, except that the reaction time was extended to 24 h. The apparent quantum efficiency (A.Q.E.) is defined as the ratio of the number of photons involved in the reaction to the total number of incident photons. The testing procedure involves the use of the same equipment as that used for photocatalytic reactions, except that the cutoff filter is replaced by a bandpass filter (here, it is exemplified by the 450 nm, 532 nm, 605 nm, 730 nm bandpass filter). The light intensity was tested by a solar power meter. And the illuminated area was about 6.925 cm2. The value of A.Q.E. was determined using the following formulas:    where n is the H2 quantity (mol), N is the Avogadro constant (6.023 × 1023 mol−1), h is the Planck constant (6.62 × 10−34 J s), c is the light velocity (3 × 108 m s−1), P is the light intensity (W), λ is the light wavelength (m), and t is the photoreduction reaction time (s).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure and morphology
As depicted in Fig. 1a, CIS@CA 2D/2D heterostructures have been prepared by an electrostatic self-assembly approach, wherein positively charged CoAl-LDH NSs and negatively charged CdIn2S4 NSs are considered as assembly units. The surface charge potentials have been probed by zeta potential measurements. As shown in Fig. 1b, CoAl-LDH NSs in DI water have a positive zeta potential of +49.3 mV, whereas the CdIn2S4 NSs have a negative zeta potential of −18.4 mV. Then, positively charged CoAl-LDH layers and negatively charged CdIn2S4 layers are layer-by-layer self-assembled to form CIS@CA 2D/2D heterostructures via an electrostatic self-assembly strategy. The successful combination of the lavender CoAl-LDH NSs with yellowish CdIn2S4 NSs can be confirmed through observing the apparent sediments and the clear supernatant from Fig. 1c. Since other TMCs (In2S3 and ZnIn2S4) also have negative zeta potentials (Fig. S1†), In2S3@CoAl-LDH and ZnIn2S4@CoAl-LDH 2D/2D heterostructures have been prepared by a similar self-assembly method.

The crystal structure properties of the synthesized samples have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As observed in Fig. 1d, the typical diffraction peaks of bare CdIn2S4 at 2θ values of ca. 14.1°, 23.2°, 27.3°, 33.0°, 40.7°, 47.4°, 43.3°, and 55.5° correspond to the (111), (220), (311), (400) (422), (440), (511), and (533) crystalline planes of the cubic spinel (JCPDS no. 27-0060), respectively.38,39 For CoAl-LDH, the characteristic diffraction peaks at 11.6°, 23.2°, and 34.7° are indexed to the (003), (006), and (012) facets of hexagonal CoAl-LDH (JCPDS no. 51-0045). Notably, compared to the pure CdIn2S4 and pure CoAl-LDH, the predominant (003) peak of CoAl-LDH at 11.6° almost disappears for CIS@CA, which could be ascribed to the reduced length of the layered periodicity.40 This suggests that the single/few layered CoAl-LDH NSs rather than the stacked CoAl-LDH NSs have been dispersed on CdIn2S4 NSs.18 The successful assembly between CoAl-LDH NSs and other TMCs (In2S3 and ZnIn2S4) has been confirmed by the XRD results (Fig. S2†).
The morphologies and microstructures of the as-synthesized CdIn2S4, CoAl-LDH, and CIS@CA hybrid samples have been examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It can be clearly seen that the CdIn2S4 NSs present a typical 2D nanostructure with a lateral size of 100–200 nm accompanied by a smooth surface (Fig. 1e). While the CoAl-LDH NSs display a hexagonal morphology with a transverse size of 40–100 nm, which tend to stack to lower their surface areas on account of the high surface energy (Fig. 1f). The SEM image of the CIS@CA hybrid clearly reveals that large amounts of CoAl-LDH NSs are uniformly dispersed on the CdIn2S4 NS surface, suggesting that CoAl-LDH NSs have been successfully incorporated with CdIn2S4 NSs. Similar SEM images are also displayed in Fig. S3,† showing that CoAl-LDH NSs were dispersed on the surface of In2S3 and ZnIn2S4 NSs. Meanwhile, Fig. 2a–c show the corresponding TEM images of CdIn2S4 NSs, CoAl-LDH NSs, and the CIS@CA hybrid. Bare CdIn2S4 and CoAl-LDH display a typical 2D morphology, which coincides well with the SEM results. Based on their lateral size difference, CdIn2S4 and CoAl-LDH are distinguished in the TEM image of the CIS@CA composite (Fig. 2c), which also discloses the intimate interfacial contact between CdIn2S4 and CoAl-LDH NSs with CoAl-LDH NSs being closely attached on CdIn2S4 NSs, forming typical 2D heterostructures. The HRTEM image of the CIS@CA composite in the inset of Fig. 2c shows an interplanar spacing of 0.283 nm, which corresponds to the (400) plane of CdIn2S4. Additionally, elemental mapping has been implemented to elucidate the chemical distribution of CIS@CA hybrids. As presented in Fig. 2d–i, Cd, In, S, Co, and Al elements are dispersed homogeneously in the selected area of the sample. The above results clarify the successful incorporation of CoAl-LDH NSs into the matrix of CdIn2S4 NSs with intimate interfacial contact.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been conducted to investigate the chemical states and elemental composition of CdIn2S4, CoAl-LDH, and the CIS@CA composite. The survey spectra of pure CdIn2S4, pure CoAl-LDH, and CIS@CA samples are shown in Fig. S4,† which suggests the coexistence of Cd, In, S, Co, and Al elements in the CIS@CA composite, which is in agreement with the elemental mapping results discussed above. Fig. 3a shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Cd. For bare CdIn2S4, the binding energy of Cd 3d5/2 at 405.3 eV and Cd 3d3/2 at 412 eV agree well with that of Cd2+ in CdIn2S4.41 Meanwhile, the peaks at 161.4 eV and 162.5 eV are attributed to S 2p3/2and S 2p1/2 in Fig. 3b, which are assigned to the S2− in CdIn2S4.42 For the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Co 2p (Fig. 3c), the Co 2p core lines of CoAl-LDH were split into Co 2p3/2 (781.4 eV) and Co 2p1/2 (797.5 eV) main peaks accompanied by satellite bands at 787.1 and 803.6 eV, respectively. The presence of the satellite bands originates from a high-spin Co2+ state in CoAl-LDH.43 The peaks of Co 2p3/2 at 781.2 eV and Co 2p1/2 at 797.0 eV are assigned to Co(III) species, and the peaks of Co 2p3/2 at 783.2 eV and Co 2p1/2 at 799.0 eV could be attributed to Co(II).44 The peak at 531.7 eV in the XPS spectrum of O 1s in Fig. 3d is due to the presence of a hydroxyl group.45,46 The binding energies in the binary CIS@CA 2D/2D heterostructures have been investigated to examine the heterostructure formation and the electron transfer process. In detail, the variation of binding energies relates to the change in surface electron density, which results from electron transfer between semiconductors with different Fermi levels.47 As seen in Fig. 3a–d, the binding energies of Cd 3d and S 2p shift positively while the binding energies of Co 2p and O 1s shift negatively in the CIS@CA composite compared to the bare component, which suggests the electron transfer from CoAl-LDH NSs to CdIn2S4 NSs.48 The optical absorption properties of bare CdIn2S4, CoAl-LDH, and the CIS@CA composite have been investigated via UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). As shown in Fig. S5,† CdIn2S4 NSs exhibit a distinct absorption edge at around 604 nm, corresponding to the intrinsic band gap absorption.49 CoAl-LDH NSs have a distinct absorption edge at a wavelength of around 530 nm and a sharper UV band of about 358 nm, which correlates with the intrinsic absorption of CoAl-LDH NSs.50 In comparison, CIS@CA displays an additional absorption band at around 730 nm, which is attributed to a 3A2g(F) → 3T1g(F) transition arising from the spin–orbit coupling.51 The UV absorption may have arisen from ligand–metal charge transfer at the CoAl-LDH surface.28,50

3.2. Photocatalytic performances
The photocatalytic H2 evolution performances of bare CdIn2S4, bare CoAl-LDH and 2D/2D CIS@CA heterostructures have been tested under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) with TEOA as the sacrificial agent. As shown in Fig. 4a, bare CdIn2S4 NSs produce accumulated H2 with prolonged irradiation time. The coupling of CoAl-LDH NSs with CdIn2S4 NSs leads to a remarkable enhancement for photocatalytic H2 evolution. As summarized in Fig. 4b, the H2 generation rate over the optimized 2D CIS@CA-20% heterostructures is about 793.4 μmol g−1 h−1, which is approximately 4.3 times that of bare CdIn2S4 NSs (183.4 μmol g−1 h−1), indicating that the H2 evolution efficiency is obviously improved. It is noted that bare CoAl-LDH NSs exhibit almost negligible photoactivity for H2 production, indicating that CoAl-LDH itself is not the active photocatalyst for H2 evolution due to fast charge recombination, but only as a cocatalyst here. Consequently, a further increase of the CoAl-LDH ratio in the CIS@CA composite leads to decreased photoactivity for H2 production, which could be ascribed to the fact that excessive CoAl-LDH nanosheets would shield the active sites over CdIn2S4 nanosheets and affect light harvesting (Fig. 4b). The effect of CoAl-LDH incorporation on enhancing the performance for photocatalytic H2 production has also been observed for other 2D TMCs of ZnIn2S4 and In2S3 (Fig. 4c and d). Specifically, the 2D ZnIn2S4@CoAl-LDH-20% photocatalyst exhibits enhanced H2 generation performance under visible light irradiation, and the H2 yield reaches 5086 μmol g−1 within 4 h, which is 1.69 times higher than that of bare ZnIn2S4 (3011 μmol g−1). Furthermore, under SSL irradiation of 4 h, the H2 yield over the ZnIn2S4@CoAl-LDH-20% composite reaches 27.3 mmol g−1 (Fig. S6†). Similarly, after visible light irradiation of 4 h, the H2 yield of In2S3@CoAl-LDH-20% is 38.4 μmol g−1, which is 5.05 times higher than bare In2S3 (7.6 μmol g−1). Importantly, CIS@CA-20% displays excellent stability under 24 h of visible light irradiation (Fig. 4e) and the produced H2 over CIS@CA-20% is about 4.56 times that over bare CdIn2S4 NSs. Additionally, the long-term stability tests of In2S3@CoAl-LDH-20% and ZnIn2S4@CoAl-LDH-20% demonstrate the good stability of the constructed heterojunctions (Fig. S7†). The crystal structures of the fresh and used CIS@CA-20% have been studied comparatively (Fig. S8†). It can be seen that no remarkable crystalline change is found for CIS@CA-20% before and after a long-term photoactivity test, further revealing the good stability of the 2D CIS@CA heterostructures. Fig. 4f shows the UV–vis absorption spectrum of CIS@CA-20% along with the apparent quantum efficiency (A.Q.E.) for photocatalytic H2 production. The A.Q.E. value at 450 nm was calculated to be 0.18%. It should be noted that the variation trend of A.Q.E. over incident light wavelength basically matches with the absorption spectra of CdIn2S4 (the inset of Fig. S5†), indicating that the H2 evolution reaction is induced by the photons absorbed by CdIn2S4 NSs.52 Similarly, the A.Q.E. values of In2S3@CoAl-LDH-20% and ZnIn2S4@CoAl-LDH-20% at 450 nm are calculated to be 0.0022% and 0.67%, respectively.

Since the photoactivity for H2 production is intimately correlated with the fate and transfer of photogenerated electrons,53 a series of photoelectrochemical and photo-luminescence characterization studies have been conducted. As shown in Fig. 5a, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves show clear anodic and cathodic peaks for each sample. Noteworthily, the current density over the CIS@CA composite is higher than that over bare CdIn2S4 NSs, which suggests that a faster electron transfer is achieved over 2D/2D CIS@CA heterostructures.2 In addition, the CIS@CA composite shows a smaller semicircle at a high frequency as compared to bare CdIn2S4 from the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) Nyquist plots (Fig. 5b), demonstrating the lower charge transfer resistance in the CIS@CA composite, which benefits the transfer of charge carriers.54Fig. 5c shows the transient photocurrent responses of CdIn2S4 and the CIS@CA composite under on–off intermittent light irradiation. The photocurrent density of the CIS@CA composite is much higher than that of pure CdIn2S4, indicating a longer lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers.55 The linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) in Fig. 5d show the polarization curves of bare CdIn2S4 and the CIS@CA composite, from which it can be seen that the composite has a higher current density than bare CdIn2S4 due to the rapid electron transport.56 CIS@CA exhibits a larger photovoltage accompanied by the slowest decay rate compared with CdIn2S4 NSs (Fig. S9†) and shows a more prolonged electron lifetime than CdIn2S4 NSs (Fig. 5e), corroborating its enhanced charge separation.10 As displayed in Fig. 5f, the average emission lifetime displays an obvious decrease for the CIS@CA composite (1.33 ns) as compared with bare CdIn2S4 (2.24 ns), further indicating the decoration of CoAl-LDH NSs onto the CdIn2S4 matrix for suppressing the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.57 The above results cooperatively validate that the introduction of CoAl-LDH NSs onto CdIn2S4 NSs contributes to boosting the efficient separation and transfer of charge carriers, thereby improving the efficiency for photocatalytic hydrogen production.

3.3. Mechanism investigation
In order to further investigate the charge carrier transfer process in the 2D/2D CIS@CA heterostructures, the energy band structures of bare CdIn2S4 and CoAl-LDH NSs have been ascertained according to Mott–Schottky and valence band XPS (VB-XPS) plots. From Fig. S10a and b,† it can be judged from the positive slope in the Mott–Schottky plots of CdIn2S4 and CoAl-LDH that they are n-type semiconductors. Besides, the flat-band potentials of CdIn2S4 and CoAl-LDH obtained from the Mott–Schottky plots are −0.67 eV and −1.18 eV versus Ag/AgCl at pH = 7, respectively. The above measured flat-band potentials (Ef, Ag/AgCl) can be converted to the normal hydrogen electrode potential (NHE, pH = 7) using the following equation:58  where Ef,NHE is the flat-band potential of the normal hydrogen electrode (pH = 7),  is 0.197 eV. Therefore, Ef,NHE of CdIn2S4 and CoAl-LDH are calculated to be −0.47 and −0.98 eV, respectively. In general, the Ef,NHE of the n-type semiconductor is 0.1–0.3 eV higher than the conduction band (CB) potential,59 so that the CB potentials of CdIn2S4 and CoAl-LDH are approximated to −0.67 and −1.18 eV (vs. NHE, pH = 7), respectively. Simultaneously, the VB value of the semiconductor can be measured by XPS valance band spectroscopy. As observed in Fig. S11a and b,† the VB-XPS values of CdIn2S4 and CoAl-LDH are found to be 1.42 and 0.88 eV, respectively. The VB potential of the normal hydrogen electrode (EVB-NHE, pH = 7) could be calculated according to the formula:60EVB-NHE = φ + EVB-XPS − 4.44, where EVB-NHE is the VB potential (vs. NHE, pH = 7), φ is the electron work function (4.5 eV) of the XPS analyser, and EVB-XPS is the VB value measured by VB-XPS plots. Hence, the EVB-NHE values of CdIn2S4 and CoAl-LDH are 1.48 and 0.94 eV, respectively. According to the value from Mott–Schottky and XPS spectral analysis, the band positions can be calculated using the following empirical formula:61ECB = EVB − Egwhere Eg is the bandgap. The calculated bandgaps of CdIn2S4 and CoAl-LDH are 2.15 and 2.12 eV, respectively, which agree well with the bandgap values obtained from the UV–vis DRS spectra (Fig. S12†).
On the basis of the above-discussed band structures of CdIn2S4 and CoAl-LDH, the ECB values of CdIn2S4 (−0.67 eV) and CoAl-LDH (−1.18 eV) are more negative than the reduction potentials of H+/H2 (−0.414 eV), indicating that both semiconductors should be able to be photoexcited to reduce H2O to H2 from a thermodynamic viewpoint. Therefore, two heterojunctions, namely the type-II hetero-junction and Z-scheme heterojunction, can be adopted to explain the enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution performance. To further confirm the transfer mechanisms of photogenerated carriers, a charge transfer tracking experiment has been conducted by selective photo-deposition of Pt particles using H2PtCl6 as a precursor.62,63 In general, PtCl62− is reduced to form Pt particles by the photo-induced electrons under illumination, and the deposition sites of Pt particles are only located at an electron-rich region, which can be used to specify the reduction sites to confirm the charge transfer process in the photocatalytic reaction. The TEM image in Fig. 6 shows that the CIS@CA composite loaded with Pt nanoparticles and Pt nanoparticles has only been deposited on CdIn2S4 NSs instead of CoAl-LDH NSs after the photoreduction process, which indicates that the photogenerated electrons mainly accumulated in CdIn2S4 rather than CoAl-LDH. This result confirms that the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers follows a type-II mechanism in the 2D/2D CIS@CA heterostructures. Under light irradiation, photogenerated electrons in the CB of CoAl-LDH will transfer to the CB of CdIn2S4, and the photogenerated holes in the VB of CdIn2S4 will be transferred to the VB of CoAl-LDH (Fig. 7), which improves the separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated pairs for enhanced photocatalysis.

4. Conclusions
In summary, novel 2D/2D TMCs@CoAl-LDH heterostructures have been successfully fabricated by a facile electrostatic self-assembly method, which demonstrate remarkably enhanced activity for photocatalytic H2 production. Specifically, compared with bare CdIn2S4, the H2 evolution rate of the CIS@CA composite (793.4 μmol g−1 h−1) reaches 4.3 fold that of CdIn2S4 (183.4 μmol g−1 h−1) without the addition of any noble metals as cocatalysts. In addition, the CIS@CA composite reveals good stability for photocatalytic H2 production under 24 h of visible light irradiation. The mechanistic investigation unveils that the CIS@CA composite forms type-II heterojunctions for the efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, resulting in improved photocatalytic activity. More intriguingly, this self-assembly strategy is universally applicable and can be harnessed to fabricate a collection of TMCs@CoAl-LDH 2D/2D heterostructures. It is expected that the present work can provide a feasible tactic to design a series of novel 2D/2D heterostructures for environmental and energy applications.
