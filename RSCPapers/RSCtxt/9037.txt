    , Accepted 17th April 2021First published on 20th April 2021AbstractThe predicaments of poor carrier separation and light absorption need to be overcome in order to maximize the preeminent performances of WO3 in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Hence, we firstly prepared a 2D WO3/PANI core–shell hybrid heterojunction with high light absorption efficiency by a simple hydrothermal and photo-assisted electro-deposition method. A photocurrent density of 0.499 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE is achieved by the as-prepared hybrid heterojunction, which is about 2.35 folds higher than that of bare WO3 (0.212 mA cm−2). Moreover, the PEC stability is significantly enhanced to 87% from 60% with the deposition of organic PANI. PEC and optical measurements demonstrate that the significant PEC properties are attributed to improved photogenerated carrier separation efficiency (ηsep) and injection efficiency (ηinj) as well as broadened light absorption due to the synergistic action of the photosensitivity effect and extended space charge region (SCR), including a built-in electric field and depletion layer, in which the lifetime of photogenerated carriers is significantly improved with depletion layers of greater widths. This work can provide a favorable example for the development of more efficient hybrid photoanodes.
1. Introduction
The development and application of renewable and abundant environment-friendly energy sources has been regarded as an extremely important method to alleviate the increasing problems of serious environment pollution and energy shortage associated with the application of traditional fossil fuel energy and the impact of human activities.1–4 As an excellent alternative to fossil fuels, the production and utilization of hydrogen fuel have been extensively studied.5 Since Fujishima and co-workers innovatively used TiO2 as a photoelectrode under the irradiation of light to obtain hydrogen in 1972,6 photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been regarded as a very promising technology to obtain hydrogen fuel by converting endless solar energy in an environment-friendly way. After decades of research, a variety of semiconductor photoelectrodes have been developed and continuously improved, including metal oxides and metal sulfides, such as ZnO,7,8 Fe2O3,9,10 WO3,11,12 CuO,13,14 BiVO4,15,16 ZnIn2S4,17,18 and CuInS2.19,20
As a widely used n-type semiconductor, WO3 with visible light response characteristics has gained more and more attention for its application in PEC water splitting due to the deeper position of its valence band (VB, ∼3 eV vs. NHE), excellent acidic environment stability, low cost and non-toxicity.21–23 Nevertheless, the problems of only ∼12% solar light absorption and lower carrier separation efficiency seriously affect the practical application of WO3 in PEC water splitting, so it still needs to be continuously modified to approach the theoretical level.24–26 In recent years, the formation of a built-in electric field with the construction of a homojunction and heterojunction has been used to suppress photogenerated carrier recombination at the interface of the junctions. Furthermore, the light absorption of the WO3 photoanode is well improved due to the coupling of a smaller bandgap semiconductor with the formation of the heterojunction. Zhang et al.27 prepared a WO3/Sb2S3 heterojunction, which showed higher photoelectric activity including a 3.98 times higher photocurrent density and a wider absorption edge of 110 nm. Zhu and co-workers28 synthesized a WO3/NiWO4 heterojunction for the first time, and the measurements revealed that its PEC performance was improved by 70% compared to that of pristine WO3 under the irradiation of visible light. However, the application of modified photoanodes consisting only of inorganic semiconductors is still restricted due to some shortcomings, such as poor efficiency of light absorption and complex process preparation.29,30
Recently, the application of organic semiconductors including 3,4-polyethylenedioxythiophene, polyaniline and polypyrrole in the field of PEC has gradually attracted more and more interest due to its excellent properties of high light absorption coefficient and outstanding conductivity.31,32 For example, Sick et al.33 reported an organic photocathode consisting of covalent organic frameworks and applied it in water splitting. A photocurrent density of 4.3 μA cm−2 at 0.3 V vs. RHE is achieved by the organic composite film of 500 nm thickness, and an IPCE value of 0.38% at 355 nm is achieved. Furthermore, compared to a traditional heterojunction formed by inorganic semiconductors, the hybridization of organic and inorganic semiconductors has become another way to improve the PEC performances of inorganic semiconductors due to the precise adjustment of optical and electrical properties, which can combine the advantages of inorganic semiconductors and organic polymers in PEC water splitting.34 Wang et al.35 prepared a ZnO/PPy hybrid photoelectrode, and measurements revealed that the photocurrent density of the hybrid structure was increased by 2 fold; the enhanced PEC performances are attributed to increased light absorption and conductivity due to deposition of PPy. Yang et al.36 combined TiO2 containing oxygen vacancies with 3,4-polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) to form a hybrid heterojunction, and the obtained heterojunction showed a photocurrent density of ∼9 times higher than that of pure TiO2. Among the organic polymers mentioned above, polyaniline (PANI) shows great potential in PEC water splitting with properties of excellent conductivity, high absorption coefficients and preeminent stability.37–42 Specifically, the appropriate location of the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) and the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) of PANI match with the CB (conduction band) and VB (valence band) of numerous inorganic semiconductor including WO3, which provides the possibility for the formation of a hybrid heterojunction in theory. However, the specific functions of PANI are not well revealed and characterized, though the coupling of organic PANI and inorganic semiconductors has been investigated in PEC application.
Hence, in this work, we deposited amorphous PANI on 2D WO3 nanoplates to obtain a core–shell organic–inorganic hybrid photoelectrode via simple electrodeposition and photoelectric deposition methods, as well as investigated the deeper impact mechanism of PANI loading on WO3. By virtue of PEC measurements, we believe that the enhanced PEC properties are attributed to the synergistic action of the photosensitivity effect as well as the extended space charge region, including the electric field at the junction and the depletion layer at the interface of photoelectrode/electrolyte, which enhances generation, separation and utilization of more minority carriers, as well as lead to longer carrier lifetimes. This work can provide a reference for the construction of other hybrid photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of 2D WO3 nanoplate arrays
A 40 mL solution including 0.231 g of sodium tungstate and 10 mL of hydrochloric acid is first prepared, and a milky precipitate is obtained with 10 minutes of stirring. The solution becomes clear with the addition of a suitable amount of ammonium oxalate solution followed by continuous stirring for 5 min. Clean FTO as a substrate is immersed in an appropriate amount of the as-prepared precursor solution of WO3 and heated at 120 °C for 12 h, and then a yellow precursor film is formed. Finally, white 2D WO3 nanoplate films are obtained by annealing for 1 h at 450 °C.
2.2 Synthesis of the 2D WO3/PANI core–shell hybrid heterojunction
A precursor electrolyte is prepared by the addition of aniline into 55 mL of deionized water. A transparent solution is obtained by stirring for 10 min. The as-prepared WO3 films are first handled applying an anodic potential of 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl under the illumination of simulated sunlight. Subsequently, WO3/PANI hybrid films are obtained via the electrochemical deposition method by applying a bias of 2.0 V (anodic potential) for the corresponding time (60 s ± 30 s).
2.3 Characterization
The crystal types of all as-prepared photoelectrodes are ascertained by using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku-D/max-2500, Cu Kα radiation). The micromorphology and microstructure of all as-synthesized samples are investigated through scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-7800F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM as well as HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy based on SEM images (SEM-EDS, AZtec from Oxford) is used to observe the distribution of required elements for as-prepared photoelectrodes. The light absorption of all photoanodes is identified by ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV-vis, DU-8B). The PEC properties of all as-obtained photoelectrodes are measured through a typical three electrode system in Na2SO4 (0.2 M) electrolyte connected to an electrochemical workstation with illumination of simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, CHF-XM500), where a Pt piece is used as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl is used as the reference electrode. The applied bias of all electrochemical measurements is converted to the potential relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the Nernst equation: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.0591pH + 0.1976 V(1)in which EAg/AgCl is the applied bias relative to the Ag/AgCl electrode and the pH is 6.48.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the XRD spectrum of bare 2D WO3 nanoplates and the WO3/PANI hybrid structure providing the crystal information of the photoelectrodes. As inevitable signals, the diffraction peaks of FTO conductive substrates are marked with “•” and indexed to SnO2 (JPCDS No. 77-0452). The diffraction peaks of (0 2 0), (2 0 0), (−1 1 2) and (0 1 4) for pure WO3 are observed at 23.6°, 24.4°, 28.6° and 48.9° respectively, which correspond to the peaks of monoclinic WO3 (JPCDS No. 83-0959). As for the WO3/PANI hybrid structure, other diffraction peaks are not observed except for the diffraction peaks of WO3 and the FTO conductive substrate, indicating that the crystal properties of monoclinic WO3 nanoplates are not changed due to the deposition of PANI. The Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of pure WO3 nanoplates and the WO3/PANI hybrid stricture are presented in Fig. 2 to investigate the chemical structure of the photoelectrodes. The characteristic peaks of the 2D WO3 nanoplates are observed at 912 cm−1 and 980 cm−1 respectively and are attributed to the stretching vibrations of O–W–O.37 The FTIR spectrum of pure PANI shows four characteristic peaks located at 1502 cm−1, 1529 cm−1, 1547 cm−1 and 1568 cm−1 respectively, which may be attributed to CC stretching of benzoid and CC stretching of quinoid units.43,44 As for the WO3/PANI hybrid stricture, the characteristic peaks belonging to PANI at 1529 cm−1 and 1547 cm−1 show slight shifts to lower wavenumbers of 1521 cm−1 and 1542 cm−1 due to the influence of intense chemical bonding between WO3 and PANI.40 Furthermore, the characteristic peaks of WO3 at 997 cm−1 may be caused by WO with asymmetric stretching vibrations.45 Meanwhile, the results of XRD and FTIR measurements prove that the WO3/PANI hybrid stricture has been successfully prepared.

The SEM images of pure WO3 and the WO3/PANI hybrid structure were obtained to investigate the microtopography of the as-prepared photoelectrodes. From Fig. 3(a) it can be observed that uniform 2D nanoplates are formed in pure WO3, which are conducive to the rapid transmission of photoinduced carriers to the FTO substrate. The high-resolution SEM image in Fig. 3(a) shows the smooth surface of pure WO3, with a thickness of ∼157 nm for the nanoplate. The SEM image of the WO3/PANI hybrid structure (Fig. 3(b)) indicates that the microtopography of WO3 is not influenced by the deposition of PANI, that is, the inorganic–organic hybrid structure maintains the characteristics of rapid transmission for photogenerated electrons. The high-resolution SEM image in Fig. 3(b) shows the surface become rough with the formation of the WO3/PANI hybrid structure, as well as the increased contact area between the hybrid photoelectrode and electrolyte, which is beneficial for the PEC reaction. Moreover, the thickness of WO3/PANI increased to 235.7 nm, and the morphology of 2D nanoplates manifests the formation of the core–shell inorganic–organic hybrid structure. The chemical signals of W, O, C and N elements are detected through SEM-EDS measurements for WO3/PANI, as shown in Fig. 3(c). Furthermore, the mapping of elements shows the uniform distribution of W, C and O, indicating that WO3/PANI is well synthesized and exhibits uniform PEC performances at the surface. Interestingly, the N element exhibits an approximately circular distribution on the surface of WO3, which is attributed to the unique chemical structure of PANI, that is, it reflects the connection of the amino groups and benzene rings. The microstructure of pure WO3 and the WO3/PANI hybrid structure is investigated through TEM and HRTEM, the results of which are displayed in Fig. 4. It can be observed for bare WO3 that a rectangle like outline is presented in the low-resolution TEM images displayed in Fig. 4(a), which may be attributed to the peculiar microtopography of 2D nanoplates. As for the HRTEM images of pure WO3, a lattice distance of 0.343 nm, 0.314 nm and 0.429 nm is observed, corresponding to the (0 1 2), (−1 1 2) and (1 1 1) crystal faces of monoclinic WO3, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4(b), a more irregular outline is observed from the low-resolution TEM images of the WO3-based photoelectrode with the deposition of amorphous PANI. The boundary of the WO3 crystal and amorphous PANI is clearly presented in the corresponding HRTEM images and may confirm the formation of WO3/PANI core–shell structure. In addition, the (0 1 2) crystal plane of monoclinic WO3 can still be clearly observed with a lattice distance of 0.343 nm, which indicates the crystal structure of WO3 is hardly affected by the loading of PANI and corresponds with results of XRD. Moreover, EDS measurements are carried out based on TEM in order to ensure the deposition of amorphous PANI. The signals of W, N, C and O elements are displayed in the EDS spectrum, and the number of signal peaks for W is more than that for N and C elements, which may be attributed to the smaller thickness of PANI in contrast to WO3. Therefore, the extra TEM measurements with different measurement conditions are carried out for the WO3/PANI hybrid structure in order to more accurately confirm the formation of the organic/inorganic core–shell structure. As shown in Fig. S1,† the boundary of organic PANI and inorganic WO3 can still be observed, which indicates that the WO3/PANI core–shell structure is formed. The enlarged view of the rectangular part in Fig. S1(a)† shows that the PANI shell has a thickness of only 7.69 nm, indicating the smaller thickness of PANI. Moreover, the HRTEM image of the WO3 core layer (Fig. S1(c)†) shows a lattice spacing of 0.360 nm, 0.314 nm, 0.233 nm and 0.221 nm, which respectively correspond to the crystallographic planes of (2 0 0), (−1 1 2), (−3 0 1) and (3 1 1). The HRTEM image of the interface between WO3 and PANI displayed in Fig. S1(d)† shows a lattice spacing of 0.260 nm corresponding to the (2 2 0) lattice plane as well as the thin amorphous PANI layer, which indicates that the WO3/PANI inorganic–organic hybrid heterojunction is well formed, corresponding to the results of SEM.

More detailed element chemical states are analyzed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 5(a), the survey spectrum displays the signals of N, C, W and O elements, corresponding with the results of EDS elements mapping. Furthermore, peaks located at 402.27 eV, 400.02 eV and 399.27 eV are observed in the high-resolution XPS spectrum of N 1s shown in Fig. 5(b) and are respectively indexed to –N+H, –NH+ and –NH–.46 In the high-resolution XPS spectrum of C 1s, the peaks with a binding energy below 287 eV including 285.92 eV and 284.72 eV may be attributed to the existence of CC or C–C bonds and C–H bonds, and the peak at 287.92 eV is indexed to CO/C–O bonds.47Fig. 5(d) shows peaks located at 35.87 eV and 38.02 eV, which correspond to signals of W6+ 4f7/2 and W6+ 4f5/2 of the hexavalent tungsten ion in WO3. Moreover, the peaks observed at 530.67 eV, 532.12 eV and 533.42 eV in Fig. 5(e) may illustrate the inevitable presence of oxygen that is respectively contained in the lattice, hydroxyl groups and the surface, which not only indicates the chemical state of WO3 but is also consistent with the results of XRD.48

The light absorption capacity of as-obtained photoanodes are evaluated through ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) measurements. As seen in Fig. 6(a), pure WO3 exhibits optical characteristics that only respond to ultraviolet and 18.5% visible light, that is, the absorption edge is located at ∼462 nm. As for the WO3/PANI hybrid structure, the absorption edge showed a noteworthy red-shift of ∼36 nm, which indicates that the deposition of PANI enhances the capture ability for solar light. In order to analyze the change of the absorption edge, Tauc plots are drawn using the following equation:49 (αhν)n = A(hν − Eg)(2)in which α signifies the absorbance coefficient, h is used to refer to the Planck constant and ν represents the frequency of light. As for n, the value is respectively 2 and 1/2 for direct and indirect semiconductors. Here, the n is denoted as 2 for WO3-based photoelectrodes.50 As seen in Fig. 6(b), the bandgap of pure WO3 is 2.68 eV, which corresponds with the results of previous research.21 The bandgap decreases to 2.49 eV with the formation of the WO3/PANI hybrid structure, which corresponds to the change of the absorption edge.

The PEC performances of all as-prepared photoanodes are first evaluated though linear sweep voltammogram (I–V) curves which are displayed in Fig. 7(a). A photocurrent density of only 0.212 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE is achieved for bare WO3. With the formation of the WO3/PANI hybrid structure, the photocurrent density is enhanced to 0.499 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is 2.35 fold higher than that of the bare WO3 photoanode. The significant enhancement of PEC water oxidation capacity may be attributed to the generation of the hybrid heterojunction and the enhanced photo-response for simulated light. Furthermore, the LSV curves measured in the dark are also shown in Fig. 7(a) and are used to evaluate the photo-response ability. In the same range of applied bias, the current density of pure WO3 and the WO3/PANI hybrid photoelectrode in the dark is much lower than the photocurrent density, which indicates that photocurrent is generated from the photoinduced carriers. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the curves of half-cell photoconversion efficiency displayed for all as-prepared photoelectrodes are applied to assess the utilization of simulated light on a PEC half-cell using the following equation:8,11,51 η = (1.23 − ERHE)JP/Plight(3)where ERHE represents the applied bias, JP denotes the photocurrent density at corresponding ERHE and Plight is the density of simulated light (100 mW cm−2). A maximum efficiency of 0.125% is achieved by the WO3/PANI hybrid structure, which is 2.84 times higher than the maximum efficiency of only 0.044% for bare WO3. The significant improvement of half-cell photoconversion efficiency may be attributed to the loading of organic PANI with a high absorption coefficient. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the applied bias of the maximum half-cell photoconversion efficiency for 2D bare WO3 and the WO3/PANI hybrid structure are located at 0.819 V and 0.754 V, respectively. The enhanced half-cell photoconversion efficiency of the 2D WO3/PANI hybrid structure implies that carrier separation is suppressed and the migration of majority carriers is promoted.52,53 Moreover, the plots of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) are displayed in Fig. S2.† A maximum IPCE of 27.41% at 370 nm is achieved by the 2D WO3/PANI hybrid structure, which is 1.26 fold higher than the maximum corresponding value of 21.67% for bare WO3. The evident enhancement demonstrates more efficient photoinduced carrier utilization for the WO3 photoanode with loading of organic PANI. Subsequently, the light response ability of bare WO3 and the WO3/PANI hybrid structure is characterized by chronoamperometry measurements, as shown in Fig. 7(c). Under AM 1.5G, all I–t curves show a vertical downward and upward trend when the simulated sunlight is blocked and unblocked, which indicates that the as-prepared samples possess excellent conductivity. Moreover, the “spike” in the curves of WO3/PANI photoanodes is smaller than that of bare WO3, which indicates that the recombination of photogenerated carriers is obviously suppressed in the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction.21 Moreover, I–T measurements without illumination for 300 s is carried out to investigate the contribution of PANI to the improved PEC performances, as shown in Fig. S3.† Interestingly, it is observed that among all-prepared photoelectrodes, an average current density of 0.00344 mA cm−2 is achieved by the WO3/PANI hybrid photoelectrode, which is higher than that of pristine WO3, 0.00301 mA cm−2. Combining these results with those of LSV under light and dark conditions, as well as I–T under periodic light and dark conditions, the slight improvement for the WO3/PANI hybrid photoelectrode implies that enhanced electrical conductivity with the loading of PANI when excellent photoresponse ability of WO3-based photoanode is not decreased. The photochemical stability of bare WO3 and WO3/PANI is evaluated through chronoamperometry for 2 h with uninterrupted irradiation of simulated sunlight. A photocurrent density equivalent to 60% of the initial state is achieved by the bare WO3 photoanode. As for the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction, better PEC stability is displayed, that is, a photocurrent density equivalent to 87% of that of the initial state (0.435 mA cm−2) is achieved, which may be attributed to being an excellent hole transport layer.54 In order to further determine the effect of amorphous PANI, cyclic voltammograms measurements of pure WO3 and the WO3 hybrid photoelectrode are obtained with lights on and lights off, as shown in Fig. S4.† Under dark and light conditions, a sole redox peak for pure WO3 is observed within a potential range of 0 V–1.23 V vs. RHE, indicating lower PEC redox activity. As for pure PANI, a sole redox peak is observed in the dark and is less intense than the three redox peaks measured under light, which indicates excellent photoresponse activity for PANI. Specifically, the generation of a reduction peak may be attributed to the p-type conductivity. The results of cyclic voltammetry confirm that the enhanced PEC activity originate from the deposition of amorphous PANI.

Open circuit voltage (OCP) measurements are applied to investigate the behavior of photogenerated carriers and the influence of a built-in electric field. First, as shown in Fig. 8(a), the OCP curves with the cycles of light on and light off for 30 s display a similar stepped trend, indicating excellent light response characteristics combined with I–t curves for 2D bare WO3 and WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunctions. Furthermore, the conductivity characteristics of n-type semiconductors are demonstrated by reduced OCP when the simulated sunlight power is turned on for bare WO3 and the WO3/PANI hybrid structure, which indicates that the surface of the hybrid photoelectrode is still dominated by the OER.55 The photovoltage of the photoelectrodes can be obtained from the difference of OCP under dark and light conditions (ΔOCP). As for the 2D WO3/PANI hybrid photoanode, its photovoltage is higher than that of bare WO3, which illustrates that the deposition of organic PANI induced enhanced band bending at the interface of WO3/PANI, promotes the separation of photogenerated carriers.56 Moreover, the curves of photovoltage with time for the as-obtained photoelectrodes displayed in Fig. S5† show that the ΔOCP gradually decreases as the PEC reaction progresses, which may be attributed to the destruction of the photoelectrodes, corresponding with PEC stability measurements. However, the ΔOCP of the 2D WO3/PANI hybrid structure is always higher than that of bare WO3, which shows that the deposition of PANI significantly enhances the PEC properties of WO3. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the enhanced PEC performances at the interface of photoelectrode/electrolyte are further investigated by measuring the lifetime of photogenerated carriers by using the following equation:6 (4)where the τ denotes the potential-dependent electron lifetime, kB represents Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature in K and e is the charge of the simplex electron. Specifically,  denotes the derivative of OCP with respect to time at the moment the light is turned on, that is, it can be approximately regarded as the slope of the point for OCP under darkness and light. Hence, a larger slope can indicate a shorter photogenerated carrier lifetime. Compared to bare WO3, the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction exhibits a smaller slope, which indicates the enhanced lifetime of photogenerated carriers due to the formation of the heterojunction and improved surface condition.57 In addition, the stable tendency for OCPT is respectively achieved at about 980 s and 1040 s by bare WO3 and the WO3/PANI hybrid structure in the dark, and the increased time to achieve the steady state may illustrate the improved PEC activity due to an extended depletion layer at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface with the loading of organic PANI. To be specific, the photocurrent is not generated due to the properties determined by OCPT measurements, which means that the photogenerated electrons are not transferred to the counter electrode. Hence, the photogenerated carriers are consumed through the transfer to the electrolyte as well as recombination. As we know, the accumulation of electrons for as-prepared photoanodes is indicated by the rise of OCPT curves.58 With the reduction of photoexcited electrons, the electron concentration increase gradually and is completely attributed to the contribution of the intrinsic electrons in n-type photoanodes when OCPT measurements are carried out for 2000 s without illumination, that is, the electrons gradually tend to go back to their unexcited state. As the influence of photoinduced electrons in the conduction band and photoinduced holes in the valence band of as-prepared photoanodes almost disappears, the steady state of OCPT curves is achieved, that is, the photoinduced carriers are almost completely consumed through recombination and transfer. Assuming that the surface charge transfer dynamics of bare WO3 and the WO3/PANI hybrid structure are equal, the longer the time for OCPT measurements to reach the steady state, the longer the time taken for recombination to consume photogenerated carriers in photoanodes. Thus, the three probable causes inferred for improved performance of the WO3/PANI hybrid structure are as follows: (1) higher photogenerated carrier concentration, (2) lower photo generated carrier recombination dynamics, and (3) higher photogenerated carrier concentration and lower photogenerated recombination dynamics. If the surface charge dynamics of the WO3/PANI hybrid structure is high, the above three possibilities still hold. Combining these inferences with the with results of EIS and Mott–Schottky measurements, the significance of time to steady state for PEC performance can be further discussed and revealed.

Hereafter, the enhancement of PEC performances and change of band bending are further investigated via Mott–Schottky (M–S) measurements using eqn (5) and (6):11 (5) (6)where C, VA, VFB, T and Nd denote the capacitance of the interface of photoelectrode/electrolyte, the applied bias vs. RHE, the flat band potential of the photoelectrode, thermodynamic temperature (300 K) and the value of donor density. The constants of e, ε, ε0 and k are the electron charge, dielectric constant of 300, permittivity of vacuum and Boltzmann's constant. As displayed in Fig. 8(c), positive slopes are observed for the as-obtained photoelectrodes through M–S measurements at a frequency of 1000 Hz, which indicate their n-type conductivity performance. Moreover, smaller slopes mean higher photogenerated carrier density as shown in Table 1. In the dark, a donor density of 7.58 × 1021 cm−3 is achieved with the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction, which is lower than 7.72 × 1021 cm−3 for pure WO3, indicating the extension of the depletion layer at the interface of photoanode/electrolyte due to the formation of the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction.59,60 Compared with a VFB of 0.51 V for bare WO3, a more negative VFB of 0.33 V is observed for the 2D WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction, indicating that greater band bending occurs due to the formation of the junction at the interface of WO3 and PANI with the generation of the built-in electric field. With the appearance of illumination, a negative shift of about 0.07 V for VFB is achieved by bare WO3, which is far less than that of 0.31 V for the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction, demonstrating the better PEC reaction kinetics of the hybrid heterojunction and the photosensitivity effect of amorphous PANI on WO3. Meanwhile, the corresponding donor density of the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction is increased to 8.64 × 1021 cm−3 and is far higher than 7.86 × 1021 cm−3 for pure WO3; the significant enhancement is attributed to the increased carrier separation due to the formation of a built-in electric field and enhanced utilization of light. Furthermore, additional M–S measurements are carried out at frequencies of 3000 Hz and 5000 Hz in the dark (Fig. S6†) in order to further ascertain the bending of the energy band and the extension of the depletion layer from the change of donor density.59 As shown in Table S1,†VFB of 0.55 V and 0.52 V are achieved by the 2D WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction at test frequencies of 3000 Hz and 5000 Hz, which are 0.04 V and 0.10 V negatively shifted from those of bare WO3 respectively, indicating the deeper band bending of WO3-based photoanodes. Moreover, carrier densities of 4.40 × 1021 cm−3 and 2.72 × 1021 cm−3 are observed for the 2D WO3/PANI hybrid photoanode, which are lower than 5.60 × 1021 cm−3and 3.68 × 1021 cm−3 of bare WO3, indicating that the enhancement of PEC performances are affected by the extension of the depletion layer.

Surface photovoltage (SPV) measurements are employed to explore the behavior of photoinduced carriers and the situation of band bending for WO3 with and without loading of organic PANI. As illustrated in Fig. 8(d), bare WO3 and the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction shows positive SPV signals, indicating the photogenerated hole transfer to photoanode surfaces under illumination, which correspond with results of OCP measurements. Moreover, the strongest SPV of 21.44 μV is achieved at 471 nm by the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction, which is 4.02 fold higher than that of bare WO3 (5.33 μV at 395 nm), indicating enhanced separation of photogenerated carriers in the space charge region (SCR) due to the generation of the built-in electric field which may attributed the intensive band bending on the surface of WO3 with the deposition of organic PANI.57 Meanwhile, the stronger SPV signal of the 2D WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction demonstrates the PANI functions as a hole transport layer, which is consistent with the results of a previous report.56
The enhanced kinetics of surface charge transfer for as-prepared photoelectrodes is investigated through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements without illumination and under illumination, and improved charge transfer kinetics can be represented by a smaller radius of Nyquist plots.21 As illustrated in Fig. 9(a), the diagrams of EIS without illumination show the smaller radius of the Nyquist plots for the 2D WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction than that of bare WO3, indicating the enhanced carrier transfer due to the improved conductivity of the photoanode with the loading of organic PANI. Moreover, the circuit diagram corresponding to the Nyquist plots is fitted and illustrated in Fig. 9(a), Rs and Rpt respectively delegate series resistance at external equipment and internal resistance for charge transfer at the Pt/electrolyte interface. And Rint represents the resistance when the charge is transferred from the photoelectrode to the electrolyte as well as the migration rate of photogenerated holes and behavior of the oxygen evolution reaction at the surface of photoanodes. As shown in Table S2,† the values of Rpt for the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction (235.2 Ω) is lower than those of bare WO3 (194.1 Ω). Furthermore, for the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction, the decreased Rint (2.08 Ω) than that of bare WO3 (3.52 Ω) demonstrates the enhanced separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs for the hybrid photoanode due to the improved charge transfer kinetics. For the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction a smaller Rs value of 29.53 Ω than that of bare WO3 (39.16 Ω) is achieved, which indicates the enhanced electrons transfer from the WO3 substrate to FTO conductive glass due to the improvement of the electron leakage case.57,61 It is worth mentioning for EIS measurements under illumination that the Rpt of the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction is significantly reduced to 127 Ω, whereas for WO3 the Rpt is 144 Ω , while Rint and Rs hardly change in contrast to the results of Nyquist plots without illumination as shown in Fig. 9(b), which may mean enhanced hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction kinetics. The difference of EIS results under disparate light conditions indicates the sensitivity of as-prepared photoanodes to UV-vis light and the increased photoelectrochemical activity, which may be attributed to the increased oxygen evolution kinetics due to the extended depletion layer at the interface of photoanode/electrolyte. Corresponding with EIS measurements, the depletion width is evaluated to investigate the behavior of photoinduced carriers at the interface of photoelectrode/electrolyte and mechanism of enhanced reaction kinetics using the following equation:62 (7)in which Csc is the space-charge capacitance per unit area and obtained through EIS measurements (shown in Table S2,† CPE1). A depletion layer of 44.99 nm is observed for the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction, which is extended by 1.42 times that of bare WO3 (31.59 nm). Corresponding with the results of OCP and PEC stability measurements, the extended depletion layer indicates enhanced photogenerated carrier lifetime for the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction. Therefore, the schematic diagram of the energy band and depletion layer at the interface of photoelectrode/electrolyte is shown in the Fig. S7† obtained by the combination of OCP, SPV and EIS measurements. It is observed that the energy band edge bent upward at the photoelectrode/electrolyte due to n-type electrical conductivity of pure WO3 and the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction. Meanwhile, the extended depletion layer stores more photogenerated holes to suppress the recombination of photoinduced carriers.

The kinetics behavior of the oxygen evolution reaction is evaluated intuitively for pure WO3 and the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction using a gas chromatograph, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 10. Over the same time of 6 h, the amount of oxygen evolved reaches about 1.85 μmol and 8.23 μmol for pure WO3 and the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction, respectively, which proves that the enhanced surface reaction kinetics is due to the deposition of amorphous PANI and corresponds with the results of EIS. Moreover, the faradaic efficiency of as-prepared photoanodes in PEC water spitting is calculated to further evaluate the efficiency and activity of PEC water splitting using eqn (8):63 Faradaic efficency = nNO2F/It(8)in which NO2 represents the molar amount of O2 measured using a gas chromatograph, n is the number of electrons transferred during the PEC water splitting reaction and denoted as 4, F is the Faraday constant and denoted as 96485.33 C mol−1, I is the value of photocurrent obtained at 1.23 V (vs. RHE) and t represents the test time, and these symbols are in international basic units. A faradaic efficiency of only 15.59% is achieved by pure WO3, which is lower than 29.48% for the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction, indicating that the enhanced efficiency of the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction in PEC water splitting is due to the loading of amorphous PANI.
 Fig. 10  The amount of O2 evolved measured under constant illumination and an applied bias of 1.23 V (vs. RHE) for pure WO3 and the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction. 
The conclusion that the improved PEC performances is due to the increased deposition of PANI can be confirmed through the comparison of PEC properties for different deposition times of PANI including 30 s, 60 s and 90 s (denoted as WO3/PANI-30 s, WO3/PANI-60 s and WO3/PANI-90 s). As shown in Fig. S8(a),† all as-prepared WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunctions show more enhanced photocurrent density than bare WO3 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, and a corresponding photocurrent density of 0.314 mA cm−2 and 0.335 mA cm−2 is respectively achieved by WO3/PANI-30 s and WO3/PANI-90 s. Subsequently, it can be observed that all WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunctions display lower charge transfer resistance than that of pure WO3 as illustrated in Fig. S8(b),† which confirms that improved surface charge transfer kinetics is due to organic PANI with excellent conductivity. Furthermore, the construction of a hybrid heterojunction is verified through more plentiful M–S measurements of WO3/PANI-30 s as well as WO3/PANI-90 s. As shown in Fig. S8(c)†, flat band potentials of 0.33 V and 0.45 V are respectively achieved by WO3/PANI-90 s and WO3/PANI-30 s, indicating that the improved PEC performances is influenced by suppressed recombination of photogenerated hole–electron pairs in the bulk.
The photoinduced carrier separation efficiencies including separation efficiency in the bulk (ηsep) and separation efficiency at the surface (ηinj) are determined in order to quantitatively evaluate the effect of the built-in electric field as well as the efficiency of carrier transfer using the following equations:21 ηinj = JH2O/JN2SO3(9) ηsep = JN2SO3/Jabs(10)where JH2O and JN2SO3 respectively represent the photocurrent density measured in an electrolyte of (0.2 M) Na2SO4 without or with a sacrificial agent (0.1 M Na2SO3), and Jabs represents photocurrent density expressed as the photo absorption rate. As shown in Fig. 11(a), a photogenerated carrier injection efficiency of 39% is achieved at 1.23 V vs. RHE for the 2D WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction, which is 1.37 times higher than that of bare WO3 (28.49%), illustrating improved surface carrier separation and enhanced oxygen evolution kinetics. Moreover, a photoinduced carrier separation efficiency of 8.97% for the bare WO3 photoanode is significantly improved to 12.48% with the construction of the 2D WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction, and the outstanding enhancement is attributed to the expand SCR at the interface of inorganic/organic, that is, the built-in electric field due to band bending at consistent Fermi levels. Interestingly, the phenomenon states that photoinduced carrier separation efficiency in bulk is continuously enhanced with the improvement of applied bias, which proves the positive proportional relationship of the SCR and ηsep.62

The detailed mechanism diagram of enhanced PEC performances due to the formation of a hybrid heterojunction is shown in Fig. 12 based on above PEC measurements. The PEC system is constructed with Pt as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and the 2D WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction as the working electrode. Photoinduced electrons respectively motivated to the conduction band and the LUMO from the valence band of WO3 and the HUMO of PANI with the generation of photoinduced holes when the ternary hybrid heterojunction is illuminated by simulated sunlight and then light with a wavelength not greater than 498 nm is absorbed. Afterwards, the photogenerated hole–electron pairs are separated by the built-in electric field (E) with the bending of energy bands at the interface of organic/inorganic. Meanwhile, the lifetime of photogenerated carriers is improved with directional movement, that is, minority carriers are transferred from the VB of the WO3 core layer to the HUMO of the PANI shell layer, and majority carriers are transferred from the LUMO of the PANI shell layer to the CB of the WO3 core layer. It should be emphasized that for photoinduced carriers, recombination generated due to migration is suppressed due to the reduction of recombination probability with unique nanoplate arrays of the WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction. Moreover, more minority carriers (photogenerated holes) transferred to the surface of the binary hybrid heterojunction can be stored provisionally in the extended depletion layer (DL, ∼44.99 nm) located at the interface of photoanode/electrolyte and then be utilized for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Hence, the lifetime and separation efficiency of photoinduced holes are further improved, and OER kinetics is further enhanced.64 In addition, the photogenerated electrons moved to the Pt piece through the thoroughfare provided by the vertically grown 2D WO3 substrate and then take part in the water reduction reaction through an external wire.

4. Conclusion
In this work, we firstly deposited organic PANI on inorganic 2D WO3 nanoplates by a simple photo-assisted electrochemical method. The 2D WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction exhibited a significantly enhanced photocurrent density of 0.499 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (vs. RHE) compared to 0.212 mA cm−2 of bare WO3. Better PEC stability is also exhibited by the WO3/PANI hybrid photoanode, 87% compared to 60% for bare WO3, and OCP measurements show the increased carrier lifetimes. Further measurements illustrate that the enhanced PEC properties of the 2D WO3/PANI hybrid heterojunction are attributed to the synergistic effect of the extended space charge region and photosensitivity function of PANI, which respectively improves the separation and utilization efficiency of photogenerated carriers and the lifetime of minority carriers as well as the photo-response activities of the 2D WO3 photoanode. We believe that this work can provide an example of the construction for 2D hybrid heterojunctions and more specific analysis of PEC action for candidate photoanodes.
