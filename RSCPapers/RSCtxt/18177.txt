    , Accepted 3rd April 2019First published on 4th April 2019AbstractOne of the advantages of perovskite solar cells is that they are compatible with low-cost and large-scale solution processes via the roll-to-roll technique. Green solvent engineering plays an important role in large-scale manufacturing. N-Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) is considered to be less toxic and a biodegradable compound, which is less harmful to the human body and the environment. However, it is difficult to achieve a high film quality for an NMP-processed perovskite film in a short time. In this communication, we developed a two-step green anti-solvent engineering technique to rapidly tune the morphology of the NMP-processed perovskite film. The first step was to deposit ethyl acetate (EA) on top of the precursor film to induce fast nucleation. Second, a methylammonium chloride (MACl) solution dissolved in isopropanol (IPA) was added to affect the crystal growth process and subsequently form a two-layer structured perovskite film including MAPbI3 as a bottom layer and mixed MAPbI3/MAPbIxCl3−x as an upper layer. The upper layer showed a significantly enhanced degree of crystallinity and reduced trap states. It has been recognized that MAPbIxCl3−x has a higher LUMO level than that of MAPbI3. Thus, the enrichment of a Cl-based perovskite near/at the surface can promote the efficient charge transfer. Furthermore, the limited content of MAPbIxCl3−x in MAPbI3 barely affects the entire absorption of the perovskite and thus the JSC of the device. The as-prepared inverted PSC yields a high PCE of 16%, mainly attributing to the obviously improved VOC and JSC, while the reference device containing the perovskite layer treated only by EA shows a PCE of 14.36%.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are considered as promising renewable energy sources1 due to their high absorption coefficient,2 high charge carrier mobility,3 long charge carrier diffusion length4 and their compatibility with low-cost and large-scale solution processes via the roll-to-roll technique. Over a few years, the power conversion efficiency of PSCs has reached up to 22.7%.5 Encouraged by the fast development of the PSC research, researchers gradually focused on the potential of PSC commercialization in terms of the long-term stability of PSCs6 and the possible environmental pollution and personal safety in large-scale manufacturing.7 Various approaches have been explored to afford stable PSCs, such as interface modification,8 morphology engineering9 and device architecture optimization,10 but the studies on environmentally friendly processing are still quite limited.7
Compared with the two-step deposition, the one-step fabrication method is a simpler deposition technique for PSCs and is more compatible with the roll-to-roll technique. To achieve high performance PSCs, adding an anti-solvent on top of the perovskite film during the film formation is a commonly used and effective route through inducing sufficient surface coverage and micron-sized crystals.11 Recently, the most frequently used precursor solvents for highly efficient perovskite films using a one-step technique are N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) and DMF/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mixed solvents, and the corresponding anti-solvents are chlorobenzene (CB) and toluene. However, CB and toluene are recognized to be highly toxic and carcinogenic. DMF can also result in environmental pollution.
NMP has low toxicity and is biodegradable; thus, it should be less harmful to the human body and the environment in large-scale manufacturing. NMP is widely used as an additive12 in the precursor solution or as one of the components of a mixed solvent,13 acting as a Lewis base to form a PbI2–NMP complex and contributing to the formation of a high quality film by retarding the crystal growth. However, the studies on NMP used as a precursor solvent for perovskite films are quite limited14 because its high boiling temperature results in the very slow crystallization of perovskites. It is difficult to achieve a high film quality in a short time, which is not favorable in high-throughput printing. The use of an anti-solvent can promote fast nucleation, but results in a small crystalline domain size and low surface coverage, and thus poor device performance.
In this context, we developed a two-step green anti-solvent engineering on an NMP-processed perovskite film to achieve good film quality in a short time. The first step is to deposit ethyl acetate (EA) on top of the precursor film to induce fast nucleation. Second, a methylammonium chloride (MACl) solution dissolved in isopropanol (IPA) was added during the grain growth process and subsequently infiltrated into the precursor film to form a two-layer structured perovskite film including MAPbI3 as a bottom layer and mixed MAPbI3/MAPbIxCl3−x as an upper layer. It has been recognized that there is a trade-off between JSC and VOC in solar cells.15 The existence of the two prototypical systems of MAPbI3 and MAPbIxCl3−x cells helps to increase the VOC without sacrificing the JSC. Finally, the as-prepared device shows an improved PCE of 16% in contrast to the control device that contains the perovskite layer treated only by EA with a PCE of 14.36%. An NMP processed perovskite film with a green anti-solvent system capable of achieving 16% PCE are rare, particularly in a short time (Table S1, ESI†).
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Both methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) and lead iodide (PbI2) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corporation. Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) was purchased from American Dyes Source, Inc. Zirconium(IV) acetylacetonate (Zr(acac)4) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. NiOx NPs were synthesized according to the method of Yin et al.16 NiCl2·6H2O (0.05 mol) was dissolved in 100 mL deionized water. Then, an NaOH solution (10 mol L−1) was added slowly into the solution to adjust the pH value up to 10. After stirring for 5 min, the colloidal precipitation was washed with deionized water four times and dried at 80 °C overnight. Finally, the obtained green powder was calcined at 270 °C for 2 h. The NiOx nanoparticles were dispersed in deionized water and filtered through a polyethersulfone (PES) filter (0.22 μm)
2.2 Device fabrication
ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by sonification in acetone, detergent, deionized water, and isopropyl alcohol and dried in a baking oven at 60 °C, followed by an oxygen plasma treatment. To fabricate inverted photovoltaic devices, NiOx nanoparticles were deposited on the pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates by spin coating at 3000 rpm and baking at 120 °C for 20 min under ambient conditions. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 1 M CH3NH3I and 1.06 M PbI2 in NMP, and then stirred at 70 °C for 30 min in a glove box. Then, the precursor solution was spin-coated onto the NiOx substrates with a two-step spin-casting process at 900 rpm with 200 rpm s−1 acceleration for 50 s and 5000 rpm with 2000 rpm s−1 acceleration for 40 s. During the second step, 400 μL EA and 100 μL MACl solution (1 mg mL−1 in IPA) were sequentially and rapidly dropped into the middle of the substrates at 20 s and 10 s before the end of the spin coating, respectively. Meantime, 400 μL EA or 400 μL MACl solution (1 mg mL−1 in IPA) was also dropped onto the perovskite precursor film at 20 s before the end of spin coating to modify the active layer for comparison. The thin film was then thermally annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. PC61BM (20 mg mL−1) was prepared by spin coating chlorobenzene solution at 2500 rpm for 30 s. After thermally annealing at 50 °C for 5 min, a Zr(acac)4 cathode interfacial layer (2 mg mL−1 in ethanol) was deposited by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, the silver cathode layer (90 nm) was thermally evaporated onto the solution-processed layer under high vacuum (<3 × 10−4 Pa). All the steps except the processing of NiOx were performed in the glove box. The effective areas of cells were 0.0576 cm2, defined by shallow masks.
2.3 Characterization and measurement

Device characterization. 
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The photovoltaic devices were characterized from reverse scans using a calibrated AM 1.5G solar simulator (SAN-EI ELECTRIC CO., LTD.), under a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2.


Perovskite film characterizations. 
SEM images were recorded on a HITACHI UHR FE-SEM SU8010. Tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed on a Veeco Nanoscope V scanning probe microscope. XPS measurements were performed on a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi XPS system. It was performed with the Al Kα line (15 kV and 15 mA) in a custom designed ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) system with a base pressure better than 5 × 10−10 mbar. XRD measurements were finished on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-Ray diffractometer. UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra were recorded on a SHIMADZU UV-3600 Plus UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The steady-state and the transient photoluminescence spectra were performed on a HORIBA Instruments Incorporated Fluorolog-3 fluorescence spectrophotometer, and were excited at 420 nm and 453 nm, respectively. All of the perovskite samples were prepared using the deposition conditions mentioned in the device fabrication section and deposited on NiOx substrates.

3. Results and discussion
The perovskite active layer was fabricated by a one-step deposition method from an NMP solution. Then, a two-step green anti-solvent process was employed, where EA was deposited on top of the wet precursor film, and then a MACl solution dissolved in IPA was added during the spin-coating process (Fig. 1a). The role of EA is to promote fast nucleation, where the film turns brown after the anti-solvent step. However, the perovskite film simply treated by EA (p-perovskite film) exhibits a small crystalline domain size and pinholes, as shown in Fig. 1b. Subsequently, the incorporation of MACl tunes the morphology by affecting the crystal growth process of the perovskite.17 The resulting film (m-perovskite film) shows obviously enlarged domain size and surface coverage (Fig. 1c), which may be related to a crystal dissolve-recrystallization process induced by the MACl solution.18 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were further performed to investigate the surface morphology, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). It is found that the m-perovskite film is smooth but shows a slightly increased surface roughness with an Rrms value of 2.04 nm, compared to that of the p-perovskite film (Rrms = 1.15 nm). Nevertheless, the results do not affect the deposition of the PCBM layer, where the SEM images reveal that the PCBM film on the p-perovskite layer is more continuous (Fig. S2, ESI†), thus contributing to the inhibition of the leakage current in the PSCs. To be noted, only the dropping of the MACl solution as the anti-solvent onto the perovskite film can easily induce cracks in the final film, while the films mentioned above look smooth and shiny. This phenomenon would be related to the fact that IPA could dissolve MAI, but has a little influence on the perovskite. Thus, it is necessary to drop EA onto the film first to induce the crystallization of the perovskite and retard the damage on the precursor film.

Fig. 2 is the XPS depth profiling that is used to obtain compositional depth information on the m-perovskite film by combining a sequence of ion gun etching cycles with XPS measurements at the corresponding surface. It is found that the chlorine component has infiltrated the perovskite layer, which is over 13 nm deep. However, the content of the chlorine component gradually decreased as the probing depth increased, which demonstrates that the chlorine component tends to concentrate near/at the film surface. The Iodine component exists in the full film and the concentration remains constant as the thickness changes, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†).

Fig. 3 illustrates the X-ray diffraction spectra of the perovskite film with/without the treatment of MACl. The peak at around 17.5° that is associated with MACl19 disappears in the m-perovskite film, indicating that the Cl perovskite phase is formed. It has been reported that the 15.7° and 31.5° peaks belong to the (100) and (200) diffraction peaks of MAPbCl3, respectively,19,20 which are not observed in the m-perovskite film. The results suggest the formation of MAPbIxCl3−x, but its relevant diffraction peaks21 are covered by those of MAPbI3.22 The XPS depth profiling analysis demonstrates that a two-layer structured perovskite film including MAPbI3 and MAPbI3/MAPbIxCl3−x is formed, in which MAPbI3/MAPbIxCl3−x tends to be on the upper layer. Furthermore, the intensity of the 14.3° and 28.6° peaks of the m-perovskite film, assigned to the (100) and (200) crystal planes of the orthorhombic lattice of the perovskite, respectively, is obviously increased compared to that of the p-perovskite film. This indicates an improved degree of crystallinity, corresponding to the SEM results.

The optical properties of both the p-perovskite and m-perovskite films were studied via the UV-vis-NIR absorption and photoluminescence measurements. The formation of MAPbIxCl3−x does not affect the global absorption profile of the perovskites, as shown in Fig. 4a. However, in the 700–800 nm absorption region, the absorption edge of the m-perovskite film was slightly blue-shifted from 777 nm to 772 nm compared to that of the p-perovskite film, which might be due to an improved degree of crystallinity.23 Notably, both of the films are semi-transparent with a transmittance of ∼22% in the 380–780 nm wavelength range (Fig. 4b).

(c) Steady-state photoluminescence spectra of the p-perovskite film and m-perovskite film with and without the PC61BM layer, measured from the air side and (d) from the quartz glass side. 
It is recognized that there are trap states in the bulk or at the surface/grain boundaries, which can induce an obviously lower bandgap with a red-shifted emission peak.24Fig. 4c reveals that the emission PL peak of the m-perovskite film is blue-shifted from 768 nm to 765 nm compared to that of the p-perovskite film, attributing to the reduction of the trap states. In order to confirm the results, single carrier devices (ITO/NiOx/MAPbI3/MoO3(12 nm)/Ag) were fabricated to estimate the trap density (nt) based on the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) technique.25 The dark current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics of the hole-only devices were plotted, as shown in Fig. 5. The linear region at the low voltages demonstrates that the I–V response is ohmic. As the voltage increases, the current increases sharply, which demonstrates a trap-filling process. The nt values can be calculated from the relation of VTFL = entd2/2εε0, where VTFL is the onset voltage of the trap filled limit, d is the thickness of the perovskite layer, ε is a dielectric constant (calculated to be a value of 32 for MAPbI326), and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity. Correspondingly, it is found that the nt for the m-perovskite is decreased to 4.12 × 1016 cm−3, compared to that of the p-perovskite (nt = 4.317 × 1016 cm−3). In the SCLC region (J ∝ V2 relation), the hole mobility of the p-perovskite and the m-perovskite is calculated to be 8.55 × 10−3 and 1.33 × 10−2 cm−2 V−1 s−1, respectively, according to the Mott–Gurney law.

Furthermore, the emission of the m-perovskite film was obviously enhanced, which also suggests its improved film quality. It has been reported that the incorporation of a Cl component into the perovskite films can lead to an increased carrier diffusion length.27 Thus, the time-resolved PL characteristics of both of the films were further investigated with the lifetime curves fitted with a bi-exponential decay function (Fig. S4, ESI†), and the relevant data was summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The fast decay component (τ1) is probably due to bimolecular recombination,28 and the slow decay component (τ2) comes from the recombination of free carriers in the radiative channel.29 In contrast to the p-perovskite film, the τ2 of the m-perovskite film is obviously enlarged and the corresponding weight fraction is increased, which indicate reduced charge carrier recombination, attributing to the reduced trap states and improved degree of crystallinity. Furthermore, it is noted that the m-perovskite film exhibits stronger PL quenching than the p-perovskite film when in contact with PC61BM, suggesting more efficient charge transfer.
An excitation wavelength of 420 nm can only penetrate a certain depth of the film. Thus, the photoluminescence characteristics of the perovskite film measured from the ITO side would be different from that of the film measured from the air side. As shown in Fig. 4d, the PL characteristics of the m-perovskite and p-perovskite films measured from the ITO side remain the same, demonstrating that the solvent engineering of MACl modifies the morphology at a certain depth, corresponding to the XPS results.
As has been mentioned above, a two-layer structured perovskite film was formed in the modified perovskite, including MAPbI3 as a bottom layer and mixed MAPbI3/MAPbIxCl3−x as an upper layer. There are two possible charge transfer routes between the active layer and PC61BM, and the corresponding energy level diagram is illustrated in Fig. 6. Here, we mainly focus on the effect of cell I on the device performance. It is recognized that MAPbIxCl3−x has a higher LUMO level.30 For cell I, the increased energy offset in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) between the MAPbIxCl3−x and PC61BM leads to a strong driving force for the electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor, which can ensure an efficient charge transfer.31 Moreover, the improved hole transport ability of the m-perovskite can facilitate the diffusion of free carriers and thus help to increase the efficiency of the charge transfer.
 Fig. 6  Energy level diagram of the functional materials in PSCs. 
The device performance of the m-perovskite was evaluated in the PSCs (ITO/NiOx/perovskite/PC61BM/Zr(acac)4/Ag), and the analogue device using the p-perovskite was also fabricated for comparison (Fig. 7 and Table 1). Introducing m-perovskite layers into the PSCs (m-PSCs) leads to an obviously enhanced device performance, mainly attributing to increased VOC and JSC, as compared to those of the reference devices containing p-perovskite layers (p-PSCs). For instance, the VOC is increased from ca. 1.04 to ca. 1.08 V, and the JSC is increased from ca. 17.0 to ca. 18.2 mA cm−2. The obviously improved VOC and JSC attribute to the passivation of the defect states and more efficient charge transfer, respectively. As a result, m-PSC shows a high PCE of 16% with JSC = 18.11 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.09 V and FF = 81.09% (Table 1). In contrast, the reference device containing the p-perovskite layer (p-PSCs) produces a PCE of 14.36% with JSC = 17.14 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.05 V and FF = 79.81%. The increased FF of the m-PSCs can be understood from the increased Rsh, which is relative to the reduced charge carrier recombination that benefits from the efficient reduction of the trap states as well as the charge transfer between donor and acceptor. Furthermore, the stabilized power output (SPO) of the m-PSCs is remarkably stable within 900 s (Fig. S5, ESI†). The experimental JSC values agree well with those calculated from the EQE measurements within 300–850 nm.

However, the increase in the concentration of the MACl solution up to 3 mg mL−1 reduces the wettability of the perovskite surface, resulting in a decreased PCE of 13.16% with JSC = 18.65 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.06 V and FF = 66.55% (Fig. S6 and Table S3, ESI†). In addition, the device containing the perovskite layer that is only modified by MACl provides a poor PCE of 11.7% with JSC = 15.7 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.07 V and FF = 69.66% (Fig. S7 and Table S3, ESI†). The obviously decreased JSC and FF must be induced by the poor morphology of the active layer.
We investigated the long-term stability of the p-PSCs and m-PSCs at ∼53% humidity and at room temperature. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), both of the films have good stability, maintaining ca. 95% of the original efficiency after a 276 h storage.
The thermal stability of the PSCs was also evaluated, and the devices kept ca. 93% of the original efficiency after being heated at 85 °C for 4 h (Fig. S9, ESI†).
Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) systems that consist of integrating photovoltaics modules can produce electricity from the solar energy, and are beneficial for the saving of fossil fuels and the protection of the natural environment. Semitransparent photovoltaics have attracted more and more academic and industrial attention because they can be employed as roofs and windows in BIPVs. Encouraged by the fast development of PSCs research and the remarkable improvement in devices performances, researchers gradually focused on the potential of their application in the field of semitransparent photovoltaics.32 Notably, a high PCE of the green solvent system processed MAPbI3 is achieved at high transmittance of 22% in the 380–780 nm wavelength range, offering great potential in semi-transparent PSCs.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have introduced a strategy using a two-step green anti-solvent engineering technique that sequentially deposits the EA and MACl solution on top of a precursor film to rapidly tune the morphology of an NMP-processed perovskite film. Then, a two-layer structured perovskite film was formed, including MAPbI3 as a bottom layer and mixed MAPbI3/MAPbIxCl3−x as an upper layer. The upper layer showed a significantly enhanced degree of crystallinity and reduced trap states. Furthermore, MAPbIxCl3−x had a higher LUMO level than that of MAPbI3. The enrichment of a Cl-based perovskite near/at the surface could promote an efficient charge transfer. In addition, the limited content of MAPbIxCl3−x in MAPbI3 barely affects the entire absorption of the perovskite and thus the JSC of the device. Thus, the as-prepared inverted PSC yielded a high PCE of 16%, mainly attributing to an obviously improved VOC and JSC, while the reference device containing the perovskite layer treated only by EA shows a PCE of 14.36%. The study presented here may stimulate further research efforts for developing green solvent engineering for highly efficient PSCs to meet the requirements of high-throughput large-scale manufacturing. Notably, the NMP-processed perovskite film exhibits a high transmittance of 22% in the 380–780 nm wavelength range, offering great potential in semi-transparent PSCs.
