    , Accepted 24th June 2020First published on 24th June 2020AbstractCircular management of carbon and nutrients is at the basis of future environmental sustainability and global food safety. However, direct resource recovery and upcycling from wastes pose safety concerns related to source contamination. By carefully evaluating the potential integrations of existing and emerging bio-technologies, we put forward new possible pathways for the clean-tech upcycling of recovered carbon and nutrients. By coupling anaerobic digestion and thermochemical gasification, the key process line converts biowastes to clean gaseous substrates (e.g. H2, CH4, CO2, CO, NH3, P2), useable for the fermentative production of safe single cell protein (SCP). The subsequent direct (aerobic) or two-stage (anaerobic/aerobic) SCP fermentation of energy-rich gases can produce protein-rich microbial biomass. Worldwide, this is estimated to generate up to 606 Mt SCP per year, with the protein content more than 3 times the worldwide annual soybean meal protein production. The combined SCP and biochar production can further capture and store up to 2.33 Gt CO2-eq per year, representing ∼50% of the Paris Agreement target on annual carbon capture. Finally, this approach could recycle up to 18.5 Mt nitrogen per year (∼8% of current N losses) and 6.5 Mt phosphorus per year (∼25% of the annual phosphorus fertilizer production). In view of a low-carbon and sustainable circular bioeconomy, this concept presents high impact and positive implications, especially in terms of safe future feed and food supply. Producing SCP as a multi-applicable recovery product can be already carried out at production costs that are competitive with those of other feed additives, especially if the social cost of carbon emissions is considered.
1. Introduction
To guarantee world's future food safety while curbing the impending climate change, a more rational and efficient use of key primary resources as well as novel global-scale actions and practices must be urgently put forward. In view of a more sustainable feed and food production, the flows of basic elements like carbon and nutrients (N and P), constantly diverted from natural cycles by means of anthropogenic activities, must serve as recycled building blocks to generate new products. Nevertheless, the widespread adoption of circular approaches is hindered by the lack of process platforms able to protect against the risk of contamination when using waste resources as a raw material. This in turn generates public health concerns over the risks posed by recovery products intended for feed and food purposes. In this sense, a key feature is the implementation of technological paths in which the consumers and the health and safety regulators have confidence, particularly involving the use of treatments that allow the transition of the recovered resources into a gas phase.1,2 In fact, the conversion of waste resources into gaseous substrates allows effective removal of potential contaminants and, by thoroughly monitoring the gas composition, the contamination between the initial waste matrix and the high-value recovery bioproducts can be avoided. In recent years, scientific and technological advances are expanding the possibilities of gaseous waste recovery and the upgrade into new, useful resources through, for instance, single cell protein (SCP) production. In this sense, the integration of biological (anaerobic digestion) and thermochemical (e.g. pyrolysis and gasification) processing of biowastes with the upcycling capabilities of the SCP platforms offers new perspectives, which deserve careful evaluation and pro-active thinking (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Conceptualization of the proposed process platform for resource recovery and upcycling from biowaste. Potential microorganisms for SCP production comprise bacteria, yeast, fungi and microalgae (see paragraph 1.2). 
1.1 Biowastes: a major problem and an enormous pool of resources
Human use of biomass for fibers, feed, food and fuel production has been estimated in the order of 4 tons dry matter per person per year, which comes to a total of 31.2 Gt per year, i.e. 106 tons dry matter per year (representing 15.6 Gt carbon per year).3 The so-called “human appropriation” accounts for about one-quarter of the global land biomass potential, also known as “net primary productivity” (NPP: 118 Gt per year, or 59 Ct C per year). Once diverted and exploited within the anthroposphere, such primary production results in the generation of organic wastes and residues, also known as biowastes (Fig. 2).3,4
 Fig. 2  Net primary productivity and human appropriation in gigatons of carbon per year (Gt C per year) (black numbers),3 with a focus on the main types and flows of biowastes generated by agricultural and urban human activities (grey box on the bottom-right). Data on main agricultural and urban waste were extrapolated by applying average carbon content coefficients (see Table 2) to data from Slade et al.5 for cropland and forestry residues (46.8% C content), from Berendes et al.6 for animal manure and sewage sludge (34.6% C content) (estimated as global animal and human faeces) and from FAO7 for food loss and waste (38.3% C content), here assimilated to the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). The residual flows of carbon from the four categories of agricultural and urban waste, amounting to 3.1 Gt C per year, differ from the total inputs of 7.8 Gt C per year due to other biowaste categories not considered as technically available (e.g. belowground unused cropland, human induced fires)8 as well as due to the carbon lost as CO2 through respiration during consumption of animal feed and human food. The factors relating to the per capita carbon dioxide emission have been calculated by dividing the total of the agricultural and urban biowaste identified in the grey box by the worldwide population, i.e. 7.8 billion. LULUC: land use and land use change. 
Biowastes are a complex mix of energy and elements that carry a considerable potential for resource recovery and upgrade, while their improper management strongly contributes to climate change and widespread environmental pollution. The uncontrolled biowaste degradation leads to methane gas and leachate emissions, and long-established agricultural practices such as land clearing by open fires generate additional CO2 and black carbon emissions. Particularly, the latter short-lived climate pollutant with a 460–1500 times stronger greenhouse gas (GHG) effect than CO2 per unit of mass constitutes a major concern.9 Overall, following a lifecycle approach, it has been estimated that integrated waste management, involving practices such as landfill mitigation and diversion, waste-to-energy recovery and material recycling, could potentially contribute to mitigate global GHG emissions by 15 to 20%.10 Such mitigation potential could only be achieved by moving beyond passive mitigation of GHG emission from current waste management practices such as waste landfilling and incineration. Indeed, adopting new active strategies that enable the recovery and the upgrade of biowaste constituents also means that the use of virgin resources (e.g. land, water, etc.) and materials (e.g. chemical fertilizers, pesticides, etc.) is displaced, and the GHG emissions caused by their production and distribution are avoided.11
The main hotspots for biowaste feedstocks overlap with agricultural and urban areas (Fig. 2). Within cities, typical organic wastes produced are the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) and sewage, while other kinds of biomass wastes, such as manure and crop residues, are derived from agriculture. Taken as a whole, biowaste from anthropogenic activities potentially represents a per capita emission of about 1.44 metric ton of CO2 per year (Fig. 2). When this is compared to the total average emissions of 5 metric ton CO2 per capita per year,12 it becomes evident that improved biowaste management is crucial to lower the environmental footprint of the feed and food chain while increasing its production potential. Nevertheless, greening the future of feed and food supply requires not only the effective integration between biowaste management and resource recovery. Indeed, another key aspect is the upgrade of waste resources into non-contaminated commodities that are safe and appreciated by the consumer and meet market demand. Overall, the high volumes of organic wastes and residues that concentrate in anthroposphere's hotspots offer the opportunity to implement technically and economically feasible new cyclic and green approaches.13
1.2 Closing the upcycling loop through microbial fermentation
After the first, interrupted industrial experiences aiming at single cell protein (SCP) production during the second half of the 20th century, we are now witnessing a comeback of SCP.2,4,11,14,15 With a crude protein content as high as 80% on a dry weight basis, SCP is mainly referred to as a proteinaceous material, which can be produced by different types of microorganisms: bacteria, yeast, fungi and microalgae.16 The possibility of using either virgin or recycled growth substrates, together with the high volumetric productivity, high nutritional value and low primary resource requirements, is driving the renewed interest in the SCP endeavor.2,4 Furthermore, microorganisms producing high-quality protein from mineral nitrogen are at the same time also able to accumulate carbon in the form of valuable biopolymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), increasing the nutritional value of SCP with prebiotic properties and broadening the field of application to bio-based plastic production. The microbial cells can also build up a variety of exocellular polymers (ECPs) with a wide range of technical and nutritional potentials.16 Overall, the versatile metabolism of these microorganisms, together with their high-value bioproduct portfolio (proteins, biopolymers, etc.), makes them the perfect “workhorses” for biological capture and upgrade of recovered carbon and nutrients in gaseous form.17 If we consider that SCP encompasses the production of products that naturally fall within the food, feed, biopolymer and biofertilizer markets,15,16 it is easy to anticipate their potential in closing the loop of resources recovered from biowastes.
So far, major research efforts have been directed towards the recovery of energy- and resource-rich gaseous streams such as biogas and syngas for bioenergy production purposes or for the synthesis of chemical commodities.18,19 A far less explored approach, with yet undescribed potential, is the biological capture of carbon and upgrading of nutrients from biowaste through microbial fermentation to produce SCP, potentially serving as an alternative protein feed additive or for the supply of high-value bio-based products. The extended recovery potential of the coupled biological-thermochemical approach calls for the investigation of other effective upcycling steps, such as the one represented by the SCP platform. The latter biological upgrading step can leverage the versatility and the efficiency of different metabolic pathways to convert the recovered gaseous compounds into high-quality SCP.
1.3 Gas substrate recovery from biowaste: extending anaerobic digestion through reductive gasification
Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a long-established and yet still evolving biological process that allows performing carbon and energy recovery from the biodegradable fraction of different biowastes. The main output of AD is biogas, where carbon is mainly converted and recovered as CH4 (60–70% v/v) and CO2 (30–40% v/v). Besides the gas phase, a nutrient-rich (mainly N and P) liquid and solid fraction, called digestate, is also produced (see Table 1).20 Biowastes such as sewage sludge and manure, having moisture contents above 85%, represent typically suited feedstocks for AD.21 The process of anaerobic degradation evolves through a cascade of interlinked biological processes, starting with the enzymatic hydrolysis of polymers such as carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. In this way, the complex structure of the biowastes is broken down into simpler monomers: sugars, long-chain fatty acids and amino acids. Following hydrolysis, acidogenesis and acetogenesis lead to the production of volatile fatty acids and acetate, with the latter being converted into methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) by acetoclastic methanogens.22 The AD process operates within a mild temperature range, spanning from psychrophilic (up to 20 °C) to mesophilic (20–45 °C) and thermophilic (45–60 °C) conditions, with the choice of the operating range depending on environmental (e.g. external temperature) and process (e.g. availability of low-grade waste heat) factors.23 Owing to its operational simplicity and versatility, the combined treatment and recovery of energy and resources from biowastes though AD has achieved a widespread diffusion.24

Among the most recent developments involving AD, its coupling with biomass thermochemical conversion processes such as pyrolysis (Py) and gasification (Gs) is receiving increasing attention.3,20,25 Research efforts targeting the combination of such biological and thermochemical processes are fostered by the possibility of broadening the range of treatable feedstocks as well as increasing the energy and material recovery potential. Indeed, Py and Gs (Py/Gs) processes can treat a carbonaceous biomass material even in its non-biodegradable form, producing a gas stream, called “syngas”, a condensable fraction, called “tar”, and a solid carbon-rich fraction called “char” or “biochar”.25 Similarly to AD, the Py/Gs processes evolve through a series of different stages. Through controlled heating in a limited or oxygen-free environment, biowastes undergo thermo-chemical reactions involving drying, pyrolysis, combustion and reduction steps. According to the reaction conditions, including operating temperature, residence time and heating rate, biowastes are fractionated into biochar, tar and syngas fractions with different ratios and compositions (see Table 1).26 Being high-temperature processes, Py/Gs require a high thermal input, which is usually guaranteed through the combustion of part of the fed biowaste or of the produced syngas. Major thermal energy inputs are needed in the drying phase, where excess water in the biowaste is vaporized. This is the reason why biowastes with a water content higher than 60% cannot be directly gasified, but must be first dewatered and/or mixed with lower-moisture feedstocks.27 Besides the actual Py/Gs steps, further energy might be required for the processing of syngas through steam reforming (SR) to convert the CH4 fraction into CO, and further water gas shift (WGS) to produce a syngas highly rich in H2 and CO2.28
When aiming at maximum gaseous resource recovery, the coupling of AD and reductive Py/Gs (i.e. Py/Gs carried out in the absence of oxygen) allows converting most of the carbon, and to some extent also nitrogen and phosphorus,29,30 into gaseous substrates (e.g. biogas, syngas, ammonia and phosphorus gaseous compounds). In terms of the process scheme, the integration of AD and Py/Gs must consider the different nature of the biowaste treated. If the input biowaste is characterized by a low moisture content and high levels of bio-recalcitrant materials (e.g. lignocellulosic biomass), thermochemical treatment through Py/Gs enables the breakdown of the bio-recalcitrant barrier, releasing and distributing the carbon and other components into gaseous (syngas), liquid (tar) and solid (char) fractions. On the other hand, AD is preferred in the case of highly biodegradable wastes characterized by a high water content.3 The full integration potential of these treatments is achieved when they are not only implemented as stand-alone treatment solutions for the specifically suited biowastes, but rather when they are combined together to enable, for instance, the thermo-chemical treatment of the solid digestate (i.e. the solid fraction resulting from AD) through Py/Gs. The higher degree of technical challenges faced when treating high water content biowastes such as anaerobic digestate through Py/Gs is justified by the increased resource recovery potential. In this sense, innovative strategies such as co-gasification of biowastes having different properties and compositions allow bypassing the techno-economic bottlenecks of combined AD-Py/Gs processes.31–33
As mentioned already, the high gaseous recovery potential offered by combined AD-Py/Gs could also represent a key feature to overcome the reluctance of the public towards the re-use of materials originating from organic wastes because these gases are free of potentially deleterious components such as viruses, pharma and personal care products, metals, etc. In addition, their composition can be continuously monitored, as it is currently done in full-scale facilities,34,35 thus avoiding potential contamination and improving the overall safety standards.

Table 1 provides an overview of the main input and output materials of AD, Py and Gs as a stand-alone or combined process, and summarizes the principal forms of carbon and nutrients (N and P) that are available as output products of the treatment process.
1.4 Aims and objectives of this analysis study
While anaerobic digestion and Py/Gs as stand-alone processes have already been investigated in detail, their combination has received less attention and, to the authors’ best knowledge, it has never been linked to a potential biological upgrading step such as SCP production. In the present study, we aim to provide the first of a kind analysis of the global potential of AD and Py/Gs processes treating biowastes to maximize resource recovery and upgrade into high-value SCP biomass. Based on a set of data and background assumptions, in line with the existing scientific literature, we analyzed in this study different possible scenarios in terms of (i) biowaste treated, (ii) AD and Py/Gs process interaction, and (iii) SCP metabolic pathways. The scenarios have been compared in terms of the final SCP output, carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) potential, nitrogen and phosphorus recovery and upcycling potential.
2. Materials and methods
To manage the complexity and the inherent variability of key parameters concerning the type and characteristics of biowaste, AD and Py/Gs process configuration or SCP fermentation setup, a set of basic assumptions were made. The values used for this study are here presented and clarified. Further details are reported in the ESI.†
2.1 Biowaste feedstock and treatment process parameters

2.1.1 Biowaste feedstock categories and biomethane potential. 
The different types of biowastes considered as the input of the AD and Py/Gs processes were classified under the following categories:
• AD: sewage sludge (Sewage) and manure (Manure);
• Py/Gs: organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) and lignocellulosic biomass (Lignocellulosics).
These categories encompass, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the type of biowaste produced mainly within cities (Sewage and OFMSW) and through agriculture (Manure and Lignocellulosics). The rationale of treating a specific biowaste feedstock either through AD or Py/Gs lies in the characteristics of the biowaste. If the input biowaste is characterized by a low moisture content and high levels of bio-recalcitrant materials (e.g. Lignocellulosics and OFMSW), thermochemical treatment through Py/Gs is preferred. On the other hand, AD is the most suited treatment in the case of waste characterized by a high-water content such as Sewage and Manure.
The properties and the composition of each biowaste category (see Table 2) were calculated as the average of the physico-chemical characteristics of organic substrates belonging to each specific biowaste feedstock category, as reported in the ECN Phyllis classification database.37 With regard to the biochemical methane potential (BMP) of each Sewage and Manure feedstock category, data from the scientific literature were taken as reference (see Table 2). Specific characteristics, properties and composition of the different substrates contributing to the final reference values adopted to define the biowaste feedstocks are reported in Table S1 in the ESI.†

The change in the syngas composition through CH4 steam reforming (SR) (eqn (1)) and further CO water gas shift (WGS) (eqn (2)) processes was calculated based on the following reactions:28 CH4 + H2O ↔ CO + 3H2(1) CO + H2O ↔ CO2 + H2(2)where eqn (1) allowed calculating the syngas composition after CH4 reforming and eqn (2) was used to estimate the further conversion of the CO fraction from syngas into H2 through the WGS reaction.
The theoretical syngas production from the thermochemical treatment of the different biowastes was calculated by using the definition of cold gas efficiency (CGE) of biomass gasification, i.e. the fraction of energy from the biomass feedstock that is converted into syngas: (3)where Mx indicates the mass of syngas produced (syn) or of the original biomass feedstock and LHVx indicates the respective low heating values. Having assumed an average CGE value for biowaste gasification of 0.4,28 and having defined typical LHV values for biomass feedstocks and syngas produced, it was possible to calculate the mass and composition of syngas produced by each biowaste feedstock category (see Table 4).

2.1.3 Combined AD and Py/Gs treatment. 
In order to evaluate the potential coupling between AD and Py/Gs, the main AD product, i.e. anaerobic digestate (AD digestate) resulting from the AD of Manure and Sewage, was considered as an input for the thermochemical treatment step. Since the water content of mechanically dewatered digestate, which is still above 70%, does not allow direct Py/Gs treatment, the generation of a co-substrate was considered. The co-substrate was assumed to be composed of the drier Py/Gs biowaste feedstocks, i.e. OFMSW and Lignocellulosics, and the higher water content substrate AD digestate. By mixing these together, a final co-substrate water content below 60% is achieved. This falls below the maximum water content of 60% that is considered acceptable for biomass thermochemical treatments.27
To identify the mass of the AD digestate dry matter used as the input of the Py/Gs process, the mass loss occurring during AD through the production of methane and carbon dioxide (i.e. biogas) was subtracted from the dry mass of the initial biowaste feedstock: (4)
Further assumption and calculations over the primary energy required for AD digestate mechanical dewatering and the final water content and the co-substrate can be found in Table S5 in the ESI.†


2.1.4 Parametric analysis. 
To further account for potential variations in the performances of AD and Py/Gs treatment steps, and to define a range of values within which the overall potentials of the envisioned approach could fall, a parametric analysis was performed. This was done by assuming that the key performance parameters for both treatment platforms could vary by ±20% from the average reference values. Therefore, the average BMP values of the various biowaste feedstocks treated through AD varied by ±20%. The same was performed with the Py/Gs process by lowering or rising the biochar yield or the gaseous nitrogen conversion efficiency as NH3 by ±20%. Furthermore, the cold gas efficiency for Py/Gs was assumed to potentially vary between 20 and 60%, thus allowing considering both low and highly efficient thermochemical treatment steps. The latter aspect is particularly relevant as it considers the sensitivity of the Py/Gs treatment in the presence of varying characteristics of the biowaste feedstock (e.g. water content, low heating value, etc.). By combining together the low and the high parametric values, a range of possible outcomes for each one of the defined scenarios (see paragraph 2.4) could be calculated. Further details about the parametric analysis assumptions may be found in Table S4 in the ESI.†

• Aerobic methane oxidation through methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB): SCP is produced through aerobic oxidation of methane, providing both carbon and energy sources to the growth of the methanotrophs. Based on the reaction stoichiometry from the literature and a gas usage efficiency of 80%,4 the amount of methane required for the production of 1 ton of SCP is 1.77 ton of CH4, resulting in an overall primary energy conversion efficiency (i.e. enthalpy of combustion of SCP biomass divided by the low heating value of the substrate) of 23.0%;
• Aerobic hydrogen oxidation through hydrogen oxidizing bacteria (HOB): SCP is produced through aerobic oxidation of hydrogen gas, which provides energy to reduce carbon dioxide into cellular biomass. Based on the reaction stoichiometry from the literature and a gas usage efficiency of 80%, the amount of hydrogen required for the production of 1 ton of SCP is 0.56 ton of H2, resulting in an overall primary energy conversion efficiency of 29.9%;
• Aerobic carbon monoxide oxidation through carbon monoxide oxidizing bacteria (COOB): SCP is produced through aerobic oxidation of carbon monoxide gas, providing both energy and carbon. Based on the reaction stoichiometry from the literature and a gas usage efficiency of 80%, the amount of carbon monoxide required for the production of 1 ton of SCP is 9.42 ton of CO, resulting in an overall primary energy conversion efficiency of 21.4%.


2.2.2 Two-stage upcycling through anaerobic gas fermentation and aerobic organic carbon fermentation. 
The production of SCP through a two-stage upcycling process foresees first the conversion of syngas to acetic acid by means of a first anaerobic fermentation step. The acetic acid is then used for the production of SCP within second and final aerobic fermentation steps. The following microbial pathways are considered in this case (see also Table 5):
• Anaerobic syngas fermentation through acetogenic bacteria (HAcB): Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas are converted anaerobically to acetic acid by means of carboxydotrophic (CO) and hydrogenotrophic (H2) acetogenic bacteria. Based on the reaction stoichiometry from the literature and a gas usage efficiency of 80%, the amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen required for the production of 1 ton of acetic acid are 2.33 and 0.17 ton, respectively;
• Aerobic acetic acid fermentation through heterotrophic bacteria (HetB): Acetic acid is converted into SCP by means of aerobic heterotrophic microorganisms that use the organic substrate both as energy and as a carbon source. Based on the reaction stoichiometry from the literature and a substrate usage efficiency of 90% (due to the high solubility and bioavailability of acetic acid), the amount of acetic acid required for the production of 1 ton of SCP is 3.09 ton. The above-mentioned conversion factors result in an overall primary energy conversion efficiency over the two-stage of 28.0% and 32.7% for CO and H2, respectively.

2.3 Scenario description
With the aim to analyze and compare different possible technological pathways for the treatment of the biowaste feedstocks and the subsequent SCP upcycling, a set of scenarios were defined and developed within the Microsoft Excel (Office 365, Microsoft Corporation, USA) software environment. Two main scenarios were considered, both foreseeing the stand-alone and the combined implementation of AD and Py/Gs treatments. Scenario 1 simulated the production of SCP through direct aerobic biogas and syngas fermentation, while scenario 2 modelled aerobic biogas fermentation combined with anaerobic syngas fermentation and subsequent aerobic acetate fermentation. The two main scenarios were further differentiated into sub-scenarios, which defined different possible process schemes based on:
• Biowaste feedstock treatment:
• Stand-alone biowaste treatment: a separated treatment of the biowaste based on their water content and bioavailability is considered (see Table 3). High-water containing and highly bioavailable substrates such as Sewage and Manure are treated by AD, while lower water containing and more bio-recalcitrant OFMSW and Lignocellulosics are treated through Py/Gs. While in this configuration AD and Py/Gs do not physically interact, they work in parallel to minimize the energy demand of the pretreatments needed to decrease the water content (for Py/Gs);
• Combined biowaste treatment: this case refers to the coupling of AD and Py/Gs through the thermochemical treatment of AD digestate as part of a co-substrate (see paragraph 2.3). In this case, the two treatment steps are integrated also in terms of process configuration, with AD digestate used as the input of the Py/Gs step;
• Syngas processing:
• Unprocessed syngas: syngas composition is not modified and used as such for SCP production; thus there is no need for further processing steps;
• Processed syngas: prior to its use in the SCP production step, syngas composition is modified and enriched with H2 through steam reforming (SR) of methane and water gas shift (WGS) of CO.
Characteristics and configurations of scenarios and sub-scenarios are reported in Table 6 and visualized in Fig. 3.

Continuous lines indicate the pathway followed by stand-alone scenarios (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2), while dashed lines identify the combined AD/Py-Gs scenarios (1.3, 1.4, 2.3, 2.4) that are obtained by processing thermochemically the co-substrate obtained by mixing dewatered AD digestate with Lignocellulosics and OFMSW biowaste feedstocks.

Sub-scenarios 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4. Under sub-scenarios 1.1 and 1.2, a stand-alone treatment of the biowaste is considered, meaning that the biological (AD) and the thermochemical (Py/Gs) treatment platforms do not interact in terms of biowaste feedstock flows. Sub-scenarios 1.3 and 1.4 instead foresee a coupled treatment, with mechanically dewatered AD digestate used as a co-substrate input material of the Py/Gs step together with OFMSW and Lignocellulosics. In all sub-scenarios, the biogas and syngas are separately upgraded into SCP by means of MOB (biogas) and HOB or COOB (syngas). For syngas fermentation under scenarios 1.1 and 1.3, only the SCP pathway (HOB, COOB or MOB) that rendered the best output in terms of SCP potential (i.e. kg of SCP per kg of initial biomass feedstock) was taken into account and used as reference for the total potential of these sub-scenarios. In sub-scenarios 1.2 and 1.4, syngas is processed through SR/WGS, with the resulting syngas enriched in H2 and CO2 being upgraded into SCP through HOB.

Sub-scenarios 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4. The biogas produced by AD is upgraded into SCP through MOB, while the syngas produced by Py/Gs is fermented anaerobically through HAcB. The acetic acid produced is then supplied to a second aerobic fermentation step for the production of SCP through HetB. In sub-scenarios 2.1 and 2.2, a stand-alone treatment of the biowaste is considered, while sub-scenarios 2.3 and 2.4 foresee coupled treatment of the biowaste, with an AD digestate-OFMSW-Lignocellulosic co-substrate used as the input material of the Py/Gs step. In sub-scenarios 2.2 and 2.4, the syngas processing through SR/WGS is simulated to maximize the input of H2 that is required by hydrogenotrophic HAcB for acetate production.
2.4 Global biowaste residue estimate
Based on research studies investigating the bioenergy potential of global biomass resources,5,6,8,48,49 the potential availability of biowaste feedstocks was calculated (see Table 7). Global biomass availability for bioenergy purposes is usually estimated in terms of primary energy content as Exajoule per year (EJ per year; Exa = 1018), which can be converted into mass by considering a conversion factor of 18 Exajoule per Petagram (EJ per Pg; Peta = 1015) or 18 EJ per Gt.3 Based on the ranges reported through the literature, two reference values for global biomass availability were selected: a value for low biowaste availability (low scenario: LS) and a value for high availability biowaste availability (high scenario: HS). The HS value corresponds to 100 EJ per year of biomass residues (about 20% of current global primary energy supply), indicated by multiple studies as the threshold of global biomass and biowaste availability for treatment and biofuel production.5 Such a threshold level can be still considered conservative as it is based on the assumptions that global diets will not change (e.g. switch to vegetarian), gains in agricultural yield will be marginal and energy crop production will not expand further by subtracting arable land to agriculture.5 In order to account for potential low availability for treatment and resource recovery of the various biowaste fractions, only one quarter (i.e. 25 EJ per year) of the total biomass residues considered for the HS was assumed to be available for the LS. Therefore, by considering two scenarios, one covering virtually all biowaste residues available (LS), and another one where only 25% of global biowaste residues can be treated, a wide range of real possibilities is covered.

The biowaste categories generally available from the literature are:5,6,8,48,49 “agriculture residues”, “forestry residues” and “wastes”, the latter including biomass residues from both municipal and industrial wastes (e.g. OFMSW and Sewage) as well as from agricultural activities (e.g. Manure). “Agriculture and forestry residues” biowaste categories were used to estimate the potential availability of Lignocellulosics biowaste, while the broader category of “wastes” was divided into OFMSW (estimated as 20% of the global primary energy available as waste) and Sewage and Manure (80% of the global primary energy available as waste) (see Table 7). The physico-chemical composition indicated in Table 2, and further detailed in Table S1 in the ESI,† was used to calculate the global carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus annual flows from biowaste residues.
2.5 Specific SCP and carbon capture utilization potentials
In order to define and compare the potential for SCP production as well as the fate of the recovered and upcycled biowaste carbon under each specific sub-scenario, SCP and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) potentials were defined. The SCP potential was calculated as the amount of SCP produced (in kg) from the treatment of one ton (dry weight) of biowaste feedstock. The SCP potentials calculated for each SCP pathway and biowaste were averaged to obtain a final SCP potential for each specific sub-scenario (see Table 6 and Table S10 in the ESI†). The CCU potential was instead calculated as the percentage of the initial carbon in the biowaste feedstock captured and upcycled into SCP carbon. Here, the SCP potentials were used to define the share of biowaste carbon recovered and upcycled from each biowaste considered. The final CCU potentials characterizing the various sub-scenarios were obtained by averaging the different specific CCU values calculated on the different biowastes (see Table 6 and Table S10 in the ESI†).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Specific potential for SCP production and carbon capture from biowaste
With the aim of allowing a straightforward comparison between the different scenarios and sub-scenarios considered here, the first set of relevant data is reported in Fig. 4. The latter displays the average values and the range of parametric variability of the SCP and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) potentials obtained under each of the scenarios and sub-scenarios reported in Table 6. Specific values obtained from the different treatments and model biowastes considered are reported in Table S10 in the ESI.†
 Fig. 4  Average SCP production and CCU potential under different scenarios and sub-scenarios (see Table 6). SCP and CCU potentials are expressed as average values of the treatment and upcycling of the different biowaste feedstocks through AD and Py/Gs. The SCP potential is calculated as the amount of SCP produced (in kg) from the treatment of one ton (dry weight) of biowaste feedstock. The CCU potential is instead calculated as the percentage of the initial carbon in the biowaste feedstock captured and converted into SCP carbon (see section 2.5). The dashed bars and the shaded areas represent the variability range resulting from the parametric analysis. In this case, the parametric variability involved a ±20% variation of BMP values for AD, and a CGE variation in the ±20% from the central value of 40%, thus going from a minimum of 20% (−20%) to a maximum of 60% (+20%). The green and yellow bars are related to the left Y-axis: SCP potential, while the blue bars are related to the right Y-axis: SCP CCU potential. 
The simulations show that the combined treatment of biowastes through AD and Py/Gs and the subsequent upgrade into SCP through direct MOB upcycling for biogas and direct HOB (sub-scenario 1.4) or the two-stage HAcB-HetB step for processed syngas (sub-scenario 2.4) provide the highest potential in terms of the average SCP output, spanning from 102.2 to 108.7 kg of SCP produced per ton dry biowaste treated, respectively. The process settings foreseen by these sub-scenarios also result in the highest CCU potentials, ranging between 12.3% (sub-scenario 1.4) and 13.6% (sub-scenario 2.4) of the biowaste feedstock carbon captured and converted into SCP. In the presence of the same process conditions, yet without the physical interaction of Py/Gs and AD treatment steps (i.e. stand-alone treatments), scenarios 1.2 and 2.2 provide lower SCP outputs and CCU potentials of 75.8 kg and 9.2% and of 79.9 kg and 10.0%, respectively.
When unprocessed syngas is used in place of processed syngas for the SCP upcycling step, the AD-Py/Gs combined treatment setting still provides higher SCP and CCU outputs than stand-alone. In fact, the 58.7 kg and 6.6% (sub-scenario 1.3) and the 75.4 kg and 9.4% (sub-scenario 2.3) SCP and CCU potentials obtained through combined treatment are higher than 46.4 kg and 5.4% (sub-scenario 1.1) and 58.5 kg and 7.3% (sub-scenario 2.1) obtained through stand-alone treatments.
It is worth noting that HOB was the only microbial mediator eventually considered for unprocessed syngas upcycling in sub-scenarios 1.1 and 1.3. This is due to their higher SCP and CCU potentials as compared to COOB (CO-oxidizing bacteria) and MOB (CH4-oxidizing bacteria). The lower potential of COOB and MOB is the result of the combination between their lower primary energy efficiency (see Table 5: 21.4% for COOB, 23.0% for MOB and 29.9% for HOB) and the lower percentage of CO and CH4 in the unprocessed syngas (see Table 3: 23% CO, 9% CH4 and 38% H2).
The thermochemical treatment of biowaste through Py/Gs, besides the recovery of valuable resources as gaseous substrates, also offers the possibility of capturing carbon in the form of a stable solid product, namely biochar. Thus, also carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be achieved. By considering a 18.5% yield of biochar from Py/Gs,42 our simulations showed that stand-alone treatment through Py/Gs holds a CCS potential (expressed as the share of initial carbon in biowaste captured in biochar) of 39.4 and 32.2% for OFMSW and Lignocellulosics, respectively, with a total average CCS of 17.9% (obtained by considering that the other two biowaste feedstocks are not treated through Py/Gs). When a combined treatment is implemented, the Py/Gs step treating the AD digestate obtained from Sewage and Manure biowaste feedstocks results in a CCS potential of 19.9, 28.0, 39.4, and 32.2% for Sewage, Manure, OFMSW, and Lignocellulosics, respectively, with a total average CCS of 29.9% (see Table S2 in the ESI†).

3.1.1. Effect of stand-alone and combined biowaste treatments. 
The differences in terms of the total SCP output and CCU potential that we observed between stand-alone (sub-scenarios 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2) and undifferentiated treatment (sub-scenarios 1.3, 1.4, 2.3, 2.4) are explained by the fact that under the stand-alone setting the AD and Py/Gs processes work in parallel to treat different fractions of the initial biowaste feedstock (Sewage and Manure for AD and Lignocellulosics and OFMSW for Py/Gs). Therefore, the resources still embedded in the digestate after AD are not recovered and do not contribute to the final upcycling process through SCP production. Instead, the combined treatment considers that the physical interaction is possible between AD and Py/Gs processes. In this case, the bio-recalcitrant resources that are concentrated in the AD digestate can be further recovered through the Py/Gs step. This increases the SCP and CCU potentials per unit of biowaste treated by providing more gaseous substrates to the SCP upcycling step.
Obviously, the practical implementation of combined treatments poses more challenges in terms of the use of high-water content substrates such as AD digestate for Py/Gs. Yet, widely established practices are available to decrease the water content of anaerobic digestate after AD, with mechanical dewatering techniques such as centrifugation capable of achieving values around 70% or lower.50 If the electricity needed to mechanically dewater AD digestate is supplied only from the produced biogas through heat and power cogeneration, this would represent about 2% of the total primary energy available from the AD step (see Table S5 in the ESI†). Once mechanically dewatered, AD digestate can be further mixed with substrates characterized by a lower water content, i.e. Lignocellulosics and OFMSW, eventually generating a co-substrate with a water content around 50% and, thus, suitable for thermochemical treatment.27
Overall, despite using a more labor intensive and complex process scheme, the consistent gain in recovery and upcycling potentials underscores how the integration of biological (AD) and thermochemical (Py/Gs) processes under combined treatment settings can be seen as the optimal process scheme. Besides the technical issues related to water content, during Py/Gs treatment a matter of paramount importance is to avoid that the CCS potential obtained through biochar production is downgraded by the emission of high amounts of CO2. As already mentioned in section 1.3, the energy input needed to sustain the Py/Gs processes implies that part of the biowaste feedstock or the syngas produced is converted into thermal energy by combustion. Assuming a cold gas efficiency (CGE) of 0.4 (see section 2.1.2) is equivalent to consider that only 40% of the energy content in the biowaste feedstock is actually converted into a useable syngas stream. The remaining energy content is mainly used to meet the energy demand of the processes and partly lost through unrecovered heat in the syngas. If the latter heat losses usually account for about 5–10% of the initial energy content in biowaste, a CGE of 40% would reflect into 50–55% of the biowaste energy content being used to sustain the Py/Gs processes.51,52 In such scenarios, high shares of the biowaste carbon would indeed be converted and emitted as CO2.
The implementation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems is being increasingly proposed as a potential alternative to mitigate carbon emission of coal-based gasification and is gaining momentum also within renewable biomass Py/Gs processes to further abate biogenic carbon emissions.53 Nevertheless, effective CCS systems require expensive equipment and operations, thereby affecting the economic viability of the overall process. If the excessive generation of carbon emissions is seen as a problem for conventional Py/Gs systems, these can turn into an opportunity for the integrated resource recovery and upcycling scheme envisioned in this work. Indeed, the techno-economic feasibility of SCP production from hydrogen is strongly dependent on the availability of concentrated CO2 streams from industrial point source emissions,4 or from direct air capture systems.54 Therefore, as an alternative to the technically cumbersome and expensive conventional capture and storage systems, the excess CO2 emitted from Py/Gs systems could be used directly as an additional source of carbon capture and utilization (CCU) for the hydrogen-based SCP pathways. In this sense, the renewable supply of green hydrogen through, for instance, wind- or solar-powered electrolysis, could augment the CCU potential of the SCP upcycling step that relies on the available syngas, thereby further improving the carbon-negative balance and the SCP production potential of the overall process. Through aerobic (HOB) or anaerobic (HAcB) hydrogenotrophic metabolism, additional hydrogen supply could in fact allow directly capturing the available CO2, as recent studies on SCP production have recently proved. This could be done, for instance, by leveraging the autotrophic aerobic metabolisms of HOB cultured alone or in combination with MOB,44,55 as well as through the anaerobic homoacetogenic metabolism of HAcB.56


3.1.2. Inter-scenario comparison of SCP and carbon capture potentials. 
The total average potentials obtained from the direct upcycling sub-scenarios (scenario 1) and the two-stage upcycling (scenario 2) are similar (see Fig. 4), reflecting the similar primary energy efficiency of the SCP mediators involved (see Table 5): 29.9% for HOB (scenario 1) and 28.0 and 32.7% for HAcB-HetB from CO and H2, respectively (scenario 2). Therefore, discriminating between these two options implies other considerations such as process efficiencies as well as capital (capex) and operational (opex) costs. In terms of capex costs, direct upcycling processes offer the advantage of using single-unit aerobic fermenters for SCP production with volumetric productivities as high as 4 kg SCP per m3 per h.4,57,58 Yet, the direct aerobic fermentation of potentially explosive gas mixtures (H2, CH4 and CO in presence of O2) requires the implementation of expensive explosion-proof equipment (ATEX). The two-stage upcycling process, as recently proposed by Molitor et al. in a pertinent study,56 offers the advantage of combining anaerobic gas fermentation and aerobic organic carbon (acetate) oxidation, providing a higher safety level in relation to the direct aerobic fermentation step. Nevertheless, the acetate production through the anaerobic gas fermentation step still limits the volumetric productivity of the two-stage system to levels around 0.07 kg SCP per m3 per h, thus necessitating further improvements to decrease the capex needed to build and operate large fermenters characterized by low productivities.
An additional major drawback of the SCP upcycling in scenarios 2 might be the direct input of syngas into an anaerobic homoacetogenic environment. Compared to more resilient and kinetically faster aerobic fermentation, anaerobic processes are in fact more sensitive to high levels of e.g. free ammonia gas or sulfides,59 which could rise above inhibitory concentrations when syngas is introduced. The inhibitory effect of reduced nitrogen and sulfur compounds on anaerobic fermentation systems has been widely reported in the literature.60,61 Since trace gases such as NH3 and H2S in syngas are first processed through anaerobic processes in scenario 2, this could give rise to key limitations in terms of process efficiency. Overall, it could be argued that nutrient supply could be more efficiently performed through the addition of readily available mineral salts, thus overcoming the limitations linked to potentially sparingly soluble gases. In this sense, the main trace gases that could serve as nutrients (i.e. NH3 and H2S) are highly soluble and, hence, their bioavailability is by far less limiting than the potential inhibitory effects that the same gas species generate in anaerobic systems.61 Given the above, the upgrade of these valuable gaseous nutrients into SCP (through the final aerobic fermentation step) without inhibiting or limiting the productivity of the anaerobic step poses major technical challenges as compared to the direct aerobic SCP upcycling foreseen under scenario 1.


3.1.3. Effect of biowaste treatment efficiency and syngas processing. 
Besides the type of SCP upcycling step, biowaste treatment efficiency in terms of biochemical methane potential (BMP) and cold gas efficiency (CGE) during AD and Py/Gs, respectively, can obviously affect the final performance of the overall process. In fact, the variable nature of the biowaste matrix can lead to a variation of the treatment efficiency, particularly in terms of substrate water content for Py/Gs. An attempt to estimate the extent of such fluctuations is reported in Fig. 4, which shows the ranges of variability that are obtained by considering lower and higher BMP and CGE for each sub-scenario (see paragraph 2.1.4 and Table S4 in the ESI†). The SCP production potential varies from a minimum of ±26% in sub-scenario 1.1 to a maximum of ±38% in sub-scenarios 1.4 and 2.4. Similar ranges apply to the carbon capture potential through SCP production (CCU), varying from a minimum of ±30% in sub-scenario 1.1 to a maximum of ±42% in sub-scenario 1.4. The variability range, thus, increases in the sub-scenarios that consider the use of processed syngas (1.2, 1.4, 2.2, 2.4), as compared to the ones dealing with unprocessed syngas (1.1, 1.3, 2.1, 2.3). Variable BMP and CGE efficiencies have a higher impact in the presence of syngas processing due to the increased SCP conversion per unit of syngas available, as compared to unprocessed syngas. In the latter sub-scenarios, the carbon monoxide and methane fractions of syngas are not upcycled into SCP and, thus, do not contribute to the final SCP and CCU potential.

3.2 Global potential for SCP production and carbon capture utilization and storage
The process combinations and interactions that we envisioned in each scenario and sub-scenario have been so far characterized in terms of specific SCP, CCU and CCS potentials. Carbon capture from the original biowaste matrix can thus take the form of carbon utilization as the main constituent of SCP (CCU) or carbon storage into long-term stable biochar (CCS). The overall carbon capture potential can therefore be expressed as carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS). Based on the specific values presented and discussed above, we estimated the global-scale potential of SCP and CCUS of the integrated treatment and upcycling platforms here outlined by applying it to the global annual biowaste flows (see paragraph 2.4).
Under a low scenario for biowaste availability (LS), the global SCP production potential ranges between 58 and 151 Mt per year (sub-scenarios 1.1 and 2.4), while CCUS potential ranges between 0.41 and 0.75 Gt CO2-eq per year (sub-scenarios 1.1 and 2.4) (Fig. 4). The same trend was observed when a high scenario for biowaste availability (HS) was considered. The global SCP production potential varied between 243 and 606 Mt per year (sub-scenarios 1.1 and 2.4), while the CCUS potential varied between 0.90 and 2.33 Gt CO2-eq per year (sub-scenarios 1.1 and 2.4).
To bring these values into perspective, Fig. 5 shows global soybean and fish production (Fig. 5a), the CO2 capture target as set by the Paris Agreement of 2015 and the annual CO2 emissions of the European transportation sector (Fig. 4b). By considering a SCP protein content of 70% on a dry weight basis,4 the 141–151 Mt per year (LS) and the 567–606 (HS) global SCP potential calculated for sub-scenarios 1.4 and 2.4, respectively, can be translated into an average SCP-protein output of 102 and 411 Mt per year. The latter values are respectively comparable (102 Mt per year) and more than three times higher (411 Mt per year) than the 128 Mt of soybean protein equivalent produced globally every year (average protein content of 37% on a dry weight basis)62 at extremely high environmental costs, particularly for the subtropical regions where global production is concentrated.63 One of the key market applications for soybean production is the supply of protein to the feed industry, for both livestock and aquaculture sectors. In addition to soy, fishmeal represents the other major high-quality protein feed ingredient currently used in the feed sector. Of the 163 Mt of global fish supply (Fig. 5a), about 26 Mt of wild fish are used every year to supply fishmeal to the fast growing aquaculture sector,64 giving rise to enormous pressures on the marine ecosystems. Such a pressing issue has already triggered multiple investments in the SCP production by means of e.g. MOB grown on natural gas,58 with the aim of providing a more sustainable alternative for protein feed additives. It is therefore clear how upcycling even lower shares of the global biowaste flows here estimated (see LS scenario in Fig. 5) would offer unprecedented opportunities to drastically reduce the exploitation of precious primary resources such as land, water, fertilizers and fossil fuels (for soybean production, processing and transportation), as well as interrupt the disruption of the delicate marine ecosystems through fishmeal production.

The dashed bars indicate the variability range resulting from the parametric analysis. Besides BMP for AD and CGE for Py/Gs, in this case the parametric variability involved also an ±20% variation from the central value of 18.5% of the biochar yield for Py/Gs. LS: low scenario for technical biowaste availability, HS: high estimate for technical biowaste availability. (1) World soybean production;65 (2) Global total fisheries production;64 (3) 2015 Paris agreement target on annual CO2 capture;15 (4) EU-28 transport sector (including aviation) CO2-eq emissions.66 
In terms of CCUS potential, both LS and HS scenarios would bring about mitigation potentials for consistent global CO2 emissions. Fig. 5b shows that more than half of the yearly CO2 capture target foreseen by the 2015 Paris agreements could be attained under a HS, while even less ambitious perpectives (i.e. LS scenarios) would capture more than half of the current emissions from the European transportation sector. To shed further light upon the potential ramifications of the envisioned approaches, it is useful to refer to a recent study on the use of SCP as a substitute of concentrated protein feeds in the livestock sector.4 In that study, it was found that globally between 10 and 19% of the total protein feed additives could be potentially substituted by 175–307 Mt of SCP, without affecting animal health and wellbeing. The same study indicated that if such SCP production was achieved through HOB fed with hydrogen and CO2 from gasification of dedicated lignocellulosic crops such as Miscanthus spp., the decrease in global cropland expansion (96 Mha) in the period between 2005 and 2050 would result in the cumulative emission avoidance of 25 Gt CO2-eq, or about 0.56 Gt CO2-eq per year. If the 175–307 Mt of SCP were to be produced using sub-scenario 1.4 or 2.4, which showed the highest potential among those analysed in this study, a CCUS potential of 0.61–1.08 Gt CO2-eq could be achieved. Such potential would be attained by treating and upcycling 1.6–3.0 Gt of biowaste. By assuming the same emission avoidance calculated for the SCP production through dedicated Mischantus biomass culture and gasification, the estimated yearly emission avoidance would increase to 1.17–1.64 Gt CO2-eq. When such CCUS potential is seen again under the perspective of the annual carbon capture target of 5 Gt CO2 of the 2015 Paris Agreement, it is evident how this can play a central role in curbing future carbon emissions.
3.3 Nutrient requirement vs. nutrient recovery and upcycle potential
Based on a crude protein content for SCP of 70%,4 the reactive nitrogen required for SCP production under LS and HS scenarios could be calculated (see Table S10 in the ESI†). To achieve an annual production between 58 and 151 Mt under the LS scenario, reactive nitrogen requirements range between 6.6 and 16.9 Mt N (sub-scenarios 1.1 and 2.4), while the higher SCP potential of 243–606 Mt per year under the HS scenario would require a N supply between 27.2 and 67.9 Mt N. Considering an average N volatilization of 75% during Py/Gs,29 the availability of N as gaseous NH3 was calculated (see Fig. 6). Under the LS and HS scenarios, when a stand-alone treatment of biomass is considered (sub-scenarios 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2), the gaseous ammonia recovered through Py/Gs is equal to 3.6 and 13.3 Mt NH3-N, respectively, corresponding to a supply in the range of 27 to 55% of the required nitrogen under the above-mentioned sub-scenarios. A combined treatment (sub-scenarios 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2) instead increases the amount of available NH3-N between 4.8 (LS) and 18.5 (HS), providing between 28 and 55% of the required nitrogen for the corresponding SCP production. The increased N availability under combined treatment settings is due to the further processing of AD digestate through Py/Gs, which is the only step where N volatilization occurs. As an example, the production of 175–307 Mt of SCP through sub-scenario 1.4 or 2.4 would require 19.6–34.4 Mt N of which about 30% (i.e. 6.0–9.7 Mt) would be available through Py/Gs gaseous ammonia recovery. Such recovery and upcycle potential of about 6 to 10 Mt N per year would thus contribute to the decrease up to 4% the current 230 Mt per year of reactive nitrogen losses.11 Moreover, more than 18 Mt N that would be intercepted under the HS scenario would cut by more than 50% the current global N losses that occur through household waste and sewage (see Fig. 6), concomitantly recycling about one fifth of the 100 Mt of chemical nitrogen fertilizer that is produced each year through the Haber–Bosch process.67,68 The latter aspect is particularly relevant as it could help saving a significant share of the 1.4% of global CO2 emissions of which chemical fertilizer production is responsible.69
 Fig. 6  Comparison of N (as gaseous NH3) and P (as gaseous P or solid P in biochar) intercepted through Py/Gs biowaste treatment under LS and HS scenarios. The dashed bars indicate the variability range resulting from a ±20% variation of the N volatilization percentage for Py/Gs. (1) household waste and sewage N losses;67 (2) global P used as a chemical fertilizer.36 
In terms of phosphorus requirements, considering a P content for SCP of 1%, the global supply needed to sustain SCP production should range between 0.6 and 1.5 Mt of P under the LS scenario, and between 2.4 and 6.1 Mt of P under the HS scenario. Phosphorus can volatilize under various forms (e.g. PO, P2) at Py/Gs temperatures above 1000–1100 °C,30,36 thus making it potentially available for SCP upcycling. Nevertheless, due to inconsistent literature data on the degree and chemical species of P volatilization, the possible analysis is limited to the total amount of P intercepted either through the syngas stream or into the solid mass of biochar when biowastes are treated via Py/Gs. The latter total amount ranges between 0.6 (LS) and 2.6 (HS) Mt P for stand-alone biowaste treatment and between 1.5 (LS) and 6.5 (HS) Mt P for combined biowaste treatment through Py/Gs, which would represent a substantial fraction of the global P used as a chemical fertilizer every year (see Fig. 6).36 Overall, the data on potential nutrient recovery and upcycling underscore, once more, the advantage offered by the combined treatment over the source-separated one. In fact, although about half of the total nutrient content in the biowaste is hydrolyzed and brought into solution during AD, and subsequently removed from AD digestate through mechanical dewatering (see Table S6 in the ESI†), the remainder can still be recovered through thermochemical treatment.
3.4 Techno-economic considerations
Compared to thermocatalysis, the use of versatile SCP biological platforms offers less stringent requirements in terms of e.g. temperature and pressure, with biocatalysts able to perform syngas conversion under mild ambient conditions. A major advantage of SCP biocatalysis is represented by its adaptability to varying gas compositions, which is instead one of the main technical hurdles for thermocatalytic processes, requiring fixed gas ratios of e.g. CO/H2.27 Moreover, if secondary gases such as NH3, volatile P or H2S represent harmful compounds, potentially leading to irreversible catalyst poisoning, the same gases are beneficial for aerobic fermentation since they can supply the nutrients required for microbial growth. At the same time, the syngas quality for SCP production must be carefully monitored for contaminants such as volatile organic compounds or trace heavy metals that might affect the final SCP product quality. Overall, the use of gases for SCP production may present a higher degree of technical challenges and imply higher capital and operational costs as compared to sugar-based aerobic fermentation systems or even to direct biowaste fermentation systems (e.g. solid state fermentation).70 Yet, the former systems bring in a level of chemical and biological safety which potentially allows high-value applications, while the latter systems are restricted in terms of the breadth of potential applications as well as of the range of biofeedstocks they can utilize for SCP production, which excludes the vast majority of waste-contaminated organic matrixes.
As far as the techno-economic feasibility is concerned, upgrading energy crops such as maize to SCP, via AD and subsequent aerobic fermentation, can yield microbial proteins at 1692 $ per ton, including capex and opex costs. Hydrogen gas produced through gasification of dedicated lignocellulosic biomass (e.g. Miscanthus spp.) is calculated to support SCP production at costs around 1507 $ per ton.4 Overall, it can be seen how the average production cost of the gas-based SCP platforms is already comparable, for example, with the 5-year average market price of fishmeal, but still higher than the one of soybean meal (see Table 8 and Table S8 in the ESI†).71 In this regard, when the total CO2 balance for each feed additive is considered along with the social cost of carbon, a final adjusted cost, entailing the long-term environmental damages of GHG emissions, can be calculated.72 As it can be seen from Table 8, the net negative CO2 balance of SCP produced through the pathways described in this study (sub-scenario 1.4) together with their higher protein content results in a final adjusted cost per protein-equivalent unit that is 17–28% lower than that of soybean meal, and 18–20% than that of fishmeal (see Table S9 in the ESI†).

In addition to the advantages in terms of social cost of carbon, when SCP is produced through resources recovered from biowaste, the actual cost of the initial substrate can be neglected, and the cycling of carbon and nutrients in a clean gas form can further lower the final production costs, or compensate for the additional expenses linked to the treatment of mixed biowaste matrixes or to the transportation of peripheral biowastes to centralized locations. In this regard, appropriate biowaste management schemes should ensure the technical and economic feasibility of complex process interactions of the biowaste-to-SCP platform. A potentially successful model might include the widespread implementation of small to medium scale decentralized AD units, able to inject biogas into a dedicated piping infrastructure connected to a centralized location,73 where the solid AD digestate is also transported. In such a central, large-scale treatment and upcycling facility, the biogas collected could be directly upcycled to SCP through MOB, while the AD digestate could be used as a co-substrate together with Lignocellulosics and OFMSW during Py/Gs to provide syngas for direct HOB or two-stage HAcB-HetB upcycling. An additional strategy could be to employ decentralized pyrolysis systems, operating a first milder and energetically self-sustainable thermochemical treatment to reduce the volume and fractionate biowastes into liquid (oil) and solid (char) fractions, enabling their transportation to a centralized location where large-scale plants could perform the final gasification treatment in a cost-effective way.27,74 In connection to techno-economic feasibility, future developments in the field of renewable energy and their integration with thermochemical treatments could lead to a widespread adoption of Py/Gs treatment for biowaste, thus enabling its integration with upcycling platforms based on the SCP concept. At the European level, where a high share of biowaste is already treated through incineration (e.g. about 30% of the generated sewage sludge is incinerated),75 a transition towards Py/Gs coupled to the SCP platforms could already be justified and fostered within the emerging EU circular economy policy. Of course, innovative and integrated biowaste management schemes and their practical feasibility and implementation should also be carefully evaluated on a regional scale to adapt to the specific quality and quantity of available biowaste, without negatively impacting the carbon and nutrient flows that are already managed circularly through, for instance, sustainable agricultural practice that make use of locally sourced manure.
4 Conclusions
Industrial production of microbial biomass in general, and single cell protein by aerobic fermentation in particular, is gaining momentum, leveraging the potential of robust process routes that give rise to a variety of consumer products within the current market economy.17 Indeed, after few decades of oblivion, the renaissance of the SCP platform is proved by the increasing number of research studies and real scale implementation efforts focusing on a wide range of potential applications, going from feed to food and from slow release organic fertilizers to building blocks for biodegradable materials.2,4,11,56,58,76 To guarantee future food safety within a low carbon and circular bioeconomy, such emerging SCP platforms can be leveraged to upcycle the carbon, the nutrient and the energy content of biowaste matrixes. This can be achieved by integrating existing biological (AD) and thermochemical (Py/Gs) biowaste treatment and recovery steps which, through controlled gaseous-driven resource recovery, can ensure against any risk of contamination of the final SCP upcycling step. Among the possible process combinations analysed in this study, a combined biological-thermochemical biowaste treatment coupled to SCP gas fermentation could allow upcycling more than 100 kg SCP per ton dry biowaste feedstock treated, concomitantly capturing up to 43.5% of the organic carbon from the initial biowaste feedstock and utilize it for safe SCP production or storing it in biochar (CCUS). When such specific potentials are applied to the biowastes available globally, a striking and unprecedented potential is unveiled. Soybean protein feed additive production could be surpassed by more than three times, covering up to 19% of the current protein feed production that is technically replaceable by SCP. Worldwide SCP production for feed, food and other biobased materials could further result in a considerable potential in terms of global carbon emission avoidance (up to 2.3 Gt CO2-eq per year) and mitigation of pollution by nutrients (i.e. by avoiding nutrient runoff and eutrophication caused by unproperly managed biowastes).
From a techno-economic perspective, the cost of SCP production through the biowaste-to-gas-to-SCP route here envisioned is already competitive with the high-quality protein supplement of fishmeal, and could be preferred to cheaper soybean meal if the externalized costs of its environmentally unsustainable production would be internalized. The first of a kind simulations, presented here, should be enriched and consolidated with more in-depth analyses of other aspects such as detailed cost analysis, safety and market acceptability studies of the SCP produced, life cycle assessment and comparison with conventional biowaste treatment processes and protein production processes.

 	Fig. 1  Conceptualization of the proposed process platform for resource recovery and upcycling from biowaste. Potential microorganisms for SCP production comprise bacteria, yeast, fungi and microalgae (see paragraph 1.2).	 

 	Fig. 2  Net primary productivity and human appropriation in gigatons of carbon per year (Gt C per year) (black numbers),3 with a focus on the main types and flows of biowastes generated by agricultural and urban human activities (grey box on the bottom-right). Data on main agricultural and urban waste were extrapolated by applying average carbon content coefficients (see Table 2) to data from Slade et al.5 for cropland and forestry residues (46.8% C content), from Berendes et al.6 for animal manure and sewage sludge (34.6% C content) (estimated as global animal and human faeces) and from FAO7 for food loss and waste (38.3% C content), here assimilated to the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). The residual flows of carbon from the four categories of agricultural and urban waste, amounting to 3.1 Gt C per year, differ from the total inputs of 7.8 Gt C per year due to other biowaste categories not considered as technically available (e.g. belowground unused cropland, human induced fires)8 as well as due to the carbon lost as CO2 through respiration during consumption of animal feed and human food. The factors relating to the per capita carbon dioxide emission have been calculated by dividing the total of the agricultural and urban biowaste identified in the grey box by the worldwide population, i.e. 7.8 billion. LULUC: land use and land use change.

 	Fig. 4  Average SCP production and CCU potential under different scenarios and sub-scenarios (see Table 6). SCP and CCU potentials are expressed as average values of the treatment and upcycling of the different biowaste feedstocks through AD and Py/Gs. The SCP potential is calculated as the amount of SCP produced (in kg) from the treatment of one ton (dry weight) of biowaste feedstock. The CCU potential is instead calculated as the percentage of the initial carbon in the biowaste feedstock captured and converted into SCP carbon (see section 2.5). The dashed bars and the shaded areas represent the variability range resulting from the parametric analysis. In this case, the parametric variability involved a ±20% variation of BMP values for AD, and a CGE variation in the ±20% from the central value of 40%, thus going from a minimum of 20% (−20%) to a maximum of 60% (+20%). The green and yellow bars are related to the left Y-axis: SCP potential, while the blue bars are related to the right Y-axis: SCP CCU potential.	 

 	Fig. 5  Global potential for SCP production (Fig. 5a) and carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) (Fig. 5b) under different scenarios. The dashed bars indicate the variability range resulting from the parametric analysis. Besides BMP for AD and CGE for Py/Gs, in this case the parametric variability involved also an ±20% variation from the central value of 18.5% of the biochar yield for Py/Gs. LS: low scenario for technical biowaste availability, HS: high estimate for technical biowaste availability.

 	Fig. 6  Comparison of N (as gaseous NH3) and P (as gaseous P or solid P in biochar) intercepted through Py/Gs biowaste treatment under LS and HS scenarios. The dashed bars indicate the variability range resulting from a ±20% variation of the N volatilization percentage for Py/Gs.
