    , Accepted 23rd October 2017First published on 26th October 2017AbstractWe modeled a prototype of a photovoltaic window, a passive source of clean energy, using a Monte Carlo ray-tracing method. We considered different geometries, material properties, and edge solar cells to determine the optimal conditions and possible electrical power yield. The modeled photovoltaic window prototype was based on colloidal luminescent low-toxic I–III–VI quantum dots (core/shell CuInS2/ZnS nanocrystals) with large Stokes shifts, high quantum yields, and tunable spectral properties. We also showed the influence of the quantum dot absorption/emission spectra on the resulting spectrum of transmitted light (i.e., the visual appearance of the photovoltaic window) using a chromaticity diagram.
Solar energy harvesting is a promising method to guarantee the global energy supply in the 21st century. A gradual and steady increase in energy production from renewable resources is currently occurring. The photovoltaic (PV) energy sector is among the most rapidly growing in this area. The installed capacity of PV solar plants and roof systems has increased 45-fold in the last decade, with an average annual increase of more than 46% that reached 231 GWp of installed capacity producing 253 TW h of electrical energy annually by the end of 2015 (corresponding to 1.1% of global electricity consumption).1,2 However, the growth rate of installed capacity has slowed recently to 28% in 2015, with the growth in solar energy decreasing to 32.6% from 91% in 2011.1,3 By maintaining these growth rates, and assuming a balance increase in global electricity consumption of ∼1% annually, solar electricity production could effectively contribute to the electricity balance and even cover our global electricity needs by 2035 (estimation based on ref. 1). However, to retain these annual rates, new solar plants with the areas comparable to countries such as Qatar should be installed by 2030. Furthermore, the newly installed area will need to be even larger to compensate for the degradation of presently installed PV capacities. These rates are not achievable with the current level of technology and cost. Presumably, a further slowing in solar energy growth will occur, in which case the overlap of produced solar energy and consumed electricity will be shifted far into the future. In contrast, the increasing production of electrical vehicles could gradually move the energy balance of the planet further from oil and gas toward the electricity sector, which is currently unable to cover these needs.
Breakthrough technologies, including safe nuclear fusion, environmentally friendly fuel cells, wind plants, and low-cost sunlight conversion, have received much attention in modern research and development. In the 1970s, the concept of luminescent collectors (and subsequent luminescent solar concentrators, LSCs) was introduced4,5 as a potential way to produce low-cost solar energy. Since then, extensive analytical and experimental research has been performed, mainly based on the application of dyes in LSCs.6–9 To improve the performance of LSCs, interesting approaches such as multidye thin-film LSCs,5,10 photonic band filters and reflectors inside the LSCs,11–13 and plasmonically enhanced LSCs,14,15 have been proposed. With the utilization of new materials, including metal oxide and rare earth element-doped glasses and polymers, exotic carbon based light-harvesting antennas, biomaterials (see extensive reviews ref. 10 and 16), and especially quantum dots (QDs),17 LSC research has been revitalized and reevaluated. Colloidal QDs have become attractive candidates as fluorophores in LSCs due to their stability, broad and high absorption, and large Stokes shifts, which reduces parasitic self-absorption.18 Most research in this area has focused on II–VI QDs and quantum rods (mainly CdSe-based19) due to the well-developed synthetic protocols, extensively studied physical and chemical properties, and excellent photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (QYs).20 To overcome limitations resulting from the high reabsorption losses of II–VI QDs, Stokes shift engineering approaches have been reported, including the formation of a giant shell around the CdSe core21,22 and changing the luminescence mechanism by doping with metal ions.23 As shown by Kennedy et al., NIR emitting II–VI QDs can significantly improve the efficiency of QD-based LSCs.24 In the last decade, I–III–VI-based QDs, such as CuInS2, have become attractive alternative materials25 for replacing Cd-based QDs in LEDs,26,27 solar light harvesting applications,28,29 and bioimaging.30 In fact, state-of-the-art I–III–VI QDs possess very large Stokes shifts (∼400–500 meV) and high QYs approaching 0.8 in solution,31 and show flexible spectral shifting due to their tunable composition. These materials show excellent promise for achieving a PLQY of 0.5 or higher in the near future using QDs embedded in transparent matrices.
Recently, this class of low-toxic QDs has been considered for application in LSCs. In particular, Klimov et al.29,32 and Sumner et al.33 reported extensive studies on the application of CuIn(SxSe1−x)2-based QDs in LSCs using both analytical and numerical mathematical modelling, and presented corresponding prototype composite materials and devices. In particular, the authors concluded that scattering losses would have a greater role with increasing QD loading for small geometric gain and dominative high waveguide losses as the device is scaled up.33 In a previous report on spectral converters, we showed that Zn–Cu–In–S (ZCIS) QDs can outcompete CdSe QDs owing to their larger Stokes shifts and corresponding lower self-absorption losses.34 Furthermore, ZCIS is a potentially non-toxic material, which is an important property for large-scale applications.
In parallel to LSCs, the harvesting of dissipative sunlight energy is viable using PV windows, which could be realized in the form of semitransparent LSCs without a back reflector (Fig. 1a). In contrast to LSCs, little attention has been paid to PV windows. To our knowledge, no special simulations have been performed for such systems based on QDs. At locations excessively illuminated by solar light, buildings equipped with semitransparent windows (or walls) could act as a passive energy source. Moreover, it is important for the quality of interior lighting conditions that these windows retain a natural spectrum (color) of transmitted light. Several concepts have been proposed toward this goal. One such approach is the direct application of semitransparent PV cells,35 which remains challenging because of the high costs involved. An alternative idea is to develop UV and NIR light absorbers in dye sensitized solar cells that will transmit visible light without distortion, as proposed by Zhang et al.36 A similar physical effect (UV and NIR light absorption) using an alternative harvesting concept was reported by Zhao et al.,37 who created fully transparent and energy producing windows using a previously reported planar solar concentration strategy (for example, in ref. 38). In this completely transparent device, molecules absorb small portions of invisible UV light and reemit this energy as secondary light at longer wavelengths partially guided to the edges by total internal reflection. At the edges, thin strips of conventional silicon-based solar cells are attached. However, extending the range of absorbed light is highly desirable. From this perspective, the development of colloidal QDs has made this a possibility, while ensuring better long-term stability.

Recently, we have developed a procedure for the fabrication of QD-in-polymer composite materials suitable for large-scale samples with controllable particle load through QD surface engineering and copolymerization.42 In the present study, we used the experimental knowledge and characterization results from our previous work to analyze the feasibility of CuInS2 (CIS)-based composites with different QYs and geometries for application in PV windows using Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, we performed a quantitative assessment of the power generation potential of this technology for two levels of average transparency in the visible optical range (90% and 70%) and analyzed the spectral content of light transmitted through the PV window prototype.
Results and discussion
The Monte Carlo or ray-tracing approach9,43–45 consists of the calculation of a single photon path through the PV window with possibilities to be transferred according to ray optics, namely, being absorbed, emitted, reabsorbed, or reflected from the interface and refracted to the outer medium. Each of these processes has a certain probability that can be calculated using the program. The ray interactions with interfaces are described by the Fresnel equation for unpolarized light, accounting for the incidence angle and refractive indices of the media. After reflection coefficient, R, for the current ray (photon) is calculated (from 0 to 1), the uniformly distributed random value within [0,1] is generated and compared with R to determine the reflection or transmission event. To trace the photon through the medium, a one-shot path is generated as a function of a random number and the extinction coefficient (more details can be found in ref. 34 and 43). This path is compared with the distance to the interface in the direction of the photon, and a decision is made regarding absorption or intersection with the interface. If the photon is absorbed, the emission probability is sampled similarly using the QY value. The wavelength of the newly emitted photon is assigned according to the normal distribution of the spectrum with the predefined central wavelength. The model accounts for the experimentally observed spectrum broadening at longer wavelengths. After photon tracing is complete, the final light flux profile (spectrum) ϕ(λ) at the edges and behind the window can be collected. The short circuit current can be calculated as an integral value of photons (converted to free carriers) with respect to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve of a solar cell according to the following equation:46 (1)
In our model, λ1 and λ2 correspond to 285 and 1250 nm, respectively.
As photovoltaic elements for the conversion of light transmitted to edges, we considered as examples two silicon-based and two alternative thin-film solar cells, which have industrial history and are established technologies or show promising stability. Importantly, they consisted of abundant materials, as follows: monocrystalline (c-Si) and amorphous silicon (a-Si) as the most common outdoor and indoor solar cells, Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) as an environmentally friendly and low-cost absorber, and CdTe, which has the lowest energy payback time reported to date and little sensitivity to low-light conditions. At present, we cannot predict which of the new emerging solar cell technologies (such as organic, perovskite, dye-sensitized, or QD-based) will achieve stable characteristics and a large-scale market. Accordingly, we limited our consideration to the well-established solar cell technologies mentioned above.
For c-Si, we measured the EQE characteristics of a commercially available cell. The following EQE characteristics were adopted: a-Si (glass/TCO/p–i–n a-Si:H/ZnO:Ag, without nanoparticles) from ref. 39, CZTS (IPCE above 8%) from ref. 40, and CdTe from ref. 41. Corresponding EQE curves are presented in Fig. 1b.
The incident light spectrum was adopted from the ASTM G173-03 (AM1.5G) spectrum of ref. 47 with normalization to 80 mW cm−2 flux. The absorption and emission spectra of our experimentally available Zn–Cu–In–S QDs embedded in polystyrene are shown in Fig. 2b (inset). These spectra are typical for CIS-based systems and exhibit large Stokes shifts and reduced self-absorption compared to most II–VI counterparts, such as CdSe/ZnS QDs.

The average transmittance in the visible region remains constant (90 or 70% for presented simulations).

Inset in (b): typical experimental emission and absorption spectra of ZCIS QDs in polystyrene, as fabricated in our laboratory. Inset in (c): photo of a luminescent composite under UV light, fabricated using the surface engineering approach (ZCIS/ZnS QDs in polystyrene42) for potential application in PV windows. 
The input absorption and emission parameters for different QDs were simulated as a set of spectra based on experimental spectra of a QD sample with emission maximum at 675 nm and absorption shoulder at 545 nm by gradually shifting the spectra so that the emission maxima covered a range of interest from 475 to 1095 nm. For each spectral profile, the Stokes shift, which was acquired from experimental curves (∼440 meV), was retained. For example, as mentioned above, the emission spectrum with the maximum at 675 nm corresponds to the absorption curve with first excitonic shoulder at ∼545 nm, while the PL maximum at 995 nm corresponds to the excitonic shoulder at 740 nm. The absorption curves were further normalized in this way, such that the average optical transmittance, T, of the prototype in the range of human eye sensitivity (400–730 nm) remained nearly constant (we chose two cases with T = 0.7 or T = 0.9). These spectral changes are shown in Fig. 2a and correspond to typically observed changes in the size and/or composition of CIS-based QDs.31 Through this spectral design we were able to define the optimal spectral profile for each solar cell and study the impact of the spectral properties of the PV window prototype on the light flux that passed the PV window and appeared for the observer as a slightly shady, but realistically colored, day light behind the window. We defined the optimal spectral profile as that which appears nearly colorless.
For every emission profile, the short circuit current for solar cells at the four edges of a 100 × 100 mm PV window prototype can be calculated. Based on the open circuit voltage (Voc) and the fill factor (FF), the maximal power can be evaluated. In our simulations, we considered different aspect ratios of the lateral dimensions, the thickness of the PV window, and their influence on the overall efficiency. For the power evaluation, we took into account that the Voc depended on the short circuit current Isc according to the relationship , and due to the shunt-resistance effect, the overall efficiency of the cell in general decreased under low-light conditions. For simplicity, in the present study we assumed that the short circuit scaled strictly linearly with the light flux, meaning that  for 1 < x < 10, and that only Voc and FF are affected by low-light conditions. The excitation and emission kinetics of the QDs were simplified here. We did not introduce the “off” state and assumed that the luminescent intensity had a linear response under sun illumination, as reflected in the average QY. QY values were iterated from 0.1 to 0.9 (we noted that QY = 1 for colloidal QDs embedded in a polymer is hard to achieve in practice). A state-of-the-art value of 0.5 has recently been reported21 and is taken here as a reasonable average value.
Photons not wave-guided to the edges by total internal reflection (referred to usually as “cone losses”) were traced by the model until they refracted from the PV window. Before this, they can be reabsorbed/reemitted and contribute to the short current (at the edges) or refract through the top or the front interfaces, thus contributing to the color of the PV window. This feature of the model makes it more correct in comparison with the analytical models, which typically ignore “cone losses”. The interface between QDs containing composite and the solar cell was modelled without an antireflective coating. Scattering and absorption losses in the matrix were considered negligible. Incident photons were traced normally to the front surface.
In the PV window, a spectral conversion (down-shifting) occurs. This process guides light to the edges, which is strongly dependent on the QY of the embedded QDs (Fig. 3). PV windows with constant transmittance in the visible region can transfer more energy if luminescent particles emit at longer wavelengths (such as in the NIR), because the light of a broader spectral range is absorbed (visible and part of the NIR, as shown in Fig. 2). Reduction of the transmittance from 90 to 70% caused the guided power to increase by a factor of 2.5 for QDs emitting at ∼700 nm, and by a factor of 3 for wavelengths (λ) >910 nm for the QY of 0.5. For example, for normal incidence of 80 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 solar irradiation, a modeled prototype with a surface of 100 × 100 mm and a thickness of 1 mm can transfer 22 mW of power to the edges with T = 90% and QY = 0.1, nearly 115 mW with T = 90% and QY = 0.5, and 260 mW with T = 70% and QY = 0.5.
 Fig. 3  Power transferred to the edges of the modelled PV window prototype (100 × 100 × 1 mm) with CIS-based QDs having varied emission wavelengths and transmittances of 90% and 70% as a function of the QD emission spectrum. Device is illuminated by the 80 mW cm−2 sun flux (AM1.5). 
In Fig. 4, the curves of the short circuit current as a function of the maximum emission wavelength of the QDs are presented for CdTe, c-Si, a-Si, and CZTS edge solar cells. An aspect ratio of 0.01 was selected for the modeled PV window (1 mm thickness, 100 × 100 mm front surface) in this simulation, which corresponds to a geometric gain (G) of 25 (defined as the ratio between the front surface area and the area of the four edges, ). Dotted graphs in Fig. 4 show statistical dispersion, which comes from the precision error of our Monte Carlo method, although the main tendencies can still be clearly followed. Due to the wide spectral range and high conversion efficiency, c-Si was superior to thin-film solar cells. However, due to the distinct dependence of Voc and FF on the light flux, this advantage may disappear under real conditions. For the c-Si solar cell, an optimal spectral range for the QD emission lay between 875 and 955 nm, while for CdTe and CZTS it was 675–755 nm, and 555–595 nm for a-Si. As shown, Isc strongly depended on the QY. In Fig. 5, these dependencies are summarized for 90 and 70% PV window transmittances for dimensions of 100 × 100 × 1 mm. The simulations were performed for each solar cell with corresponding optimal central emission wavelengths.

 Fig. 5  Photocurrent of edge solar cells as a function of QY for a PV window prototype with surface area of 100 × 100 mm, thickness of 1 mm, and geometric gain (G) of 25 (incident spectrum AM1.5, 80 mW cm−2). Data provided for transmittances of (a) 90% and (b) 70%, respectively. 
We observed the linear dependency of current on QY (Fig. 5). As the simulations were performed for different spectral profiles for each solar cell (optimal selection for each cell), the increase in Isc upon changing from 90% to 70% transmittance differed. This change was most pronounced for the c-Si solar cell (factor of 2.8), while for other solar cells the photocurrent increased by a factor of 2.17–2.25. This behavior of the c-Si solar cell can be explained by its better performance in the NIR spectral region. According to our simulation method, we used the spectral profile for the central emission wavelength 915 nm. To keep the transmittance constant at 70%, absorption was reduced in the blue range, but increased in the red range and NIR region. In the latter region, the integral amount of photons was higher, meaning that the overall increase in Isc for the c-Si solar cell was steeper (Fig. 5b).
Along with the influence of the QD spectral properties on the performance of the PV window, the geometry of the device also alters the output. An increase in the aspect ratio (understood as an increase in thickness of the PV window by constant front area) and a corresponding decrease in the geometric gain pump edges with more photons able to reach them with less reflection events at the front and the back interface. Therefore, more power can be transferred and harvested. At a lower G, the current in the solar cell reaches saturation. This is exemplified by the c-Si based PV window in Fig. 6a. In contrast, an increase in the device thickness influences the concentration effect of the PV window. Therefore, we observe a decrease in the power concentration factor (c-factor, defined as a ratio of flux densities incident onto the edges and front surface, Fig. 6b). In this case, a decrease in solar cell efficiency is expected. For example, an increase in the aspect ratio from 0.01 to 0.02 boosts the photocurrent by 50%. Meanwhile, the c-factor decreases from nearly 0.8 to 0.6 for QDs with a central emission wavelength of 755 nm and a QY of 0.5. We referred to the study on the effect of low-light conditions on solar cells performance by Randall et al.48 Based on data for several c-Si solar cells and modules, we noted that the efficiency should not decrease more than by 2.5% for a c-factor drop from 0.8 to 0.6. Therefore, thicker windows would be beneficial to the performance. However, the design, mass, and price of the matrix (such as polymer or glass) may be an essential restrictive factor. To our knowledge, for large-scale mass production applications, an aspect ratio of more than 0.01 is unlikely (for example, 1 cm thickness with 1 m2 surface area). Therefore, we adopted this value as a standard for further considerations. The c-factor dependency on the geometric gain in Fig. 6b showed an initial quasilinear increase (defined by geometry) with further saturation defined by waveguide losses. This behavior was consistent with analytical models of LSCs32 and primarily comes from thermodynamic restrictions of the concentration for every luminescent moiety. Additionally, we noted that, under the given conditions (Fig. 6b), the c-factor can exceed unity if the QY of QDs containing composite materials reaches 0.7.
 Fig. 6  (a) Photocurrent and (b) power concentration factor (c-factor) of a c-Si solar cell at the edges of a PV window prototype as a function of varying geometric gain, G (for 100 mm × 100 mm surface area), at constant emission and absorption profile of CIS QDs (λemission = 755 nm, under AM1.5, 80 mW cm−2 illumination, transmittance of the PV window = 70%). QY varies in the range 0.1–0.9. 
For future consumers of PV windows, the transmitted light spectrum is of high importance. The Monte Carlo tracing is a convenient instrument for studying changes in the spectrum of transmitted light behind the window, in combination with the chromaticity diagram. Again, we gradually shifted the spectral profile of the QDs inside the modeled window and collected the output spectra, as shown in Fig. 7a. Furthermore, based on these spectra (converted to power per area), the CIE† 1931 coordinates were calculated.
 Fig. 7  (a) Spectra of transmitted light through the PV window prototype (aspect ratio = 0.01, G = 25, average transmittance = 70%) with varying QD spectral properties. As an example, the spectra for luminescent particles emitting with QY = 0.5 at λmax = 475 nm, 635 nm, 795 nm, 955 nm, and 1075 nm are shown. The thick line is the AM 1.5G Sun spectrum (80 mW cm−2). (b) Positions of the transmitted spectra through a simulated PV window on the chromaticity diagram (CIE 1931), exemplified for an aspect ratio = 0.01, average transmittance = 70%, and QY = 0.5. 
Modification of the transmitted spectrum and the appearance of the window color were caused by a high absorption coefficient of the QDs at shorter wavelengths (black arrow, Fig. 7a), and the appearance of QD emission through the “escape cone” (red arrows). Therefore, the incident white light can be essentially shifted to green, brown, or red tones. The corresponding evolution of chromaticity coordinates is shown in Fig. 7b. The points in the diagram follow an elliptical curve. We noted that the QDs emitting in the spectral region 515–675 nm contributed to the appearance of the color. The closest points to white light in the color space corresponded to λ > 795 nm. The spectrum in Fig. 7a, which corresponds to a central emission wavelength of 475 nm, provides a too low system efficiency, and cannot be considered for potential application. By combining these findings with the analysis of data shown in Fig. 4, we were able to conclude that, to keep the PV window colorless and ensure high efficiency of the device, we should use QDs emitting at λ > 795 nm in combination with silicon edge solar cells or solar cells with similar spectral properties.
Notably, CIS/ZnS or ZCIS/ZnS QDs do not exhibit an efficient luminescence in the NIR spectral region.49 The bulk energy gap of 1.53 eV can be increased to 2 eV and beyond, causing emission in the spectral range 600–700 nm. An example is shown in Fig. 2c. To achieve further emission shifts to the NIR, CIS nanocrystals can be doped/alloyed with selenium, as reported by Meinardi et al.29
Based on the obtained data for four solar cells, we evaluated the maximum power generated by a CIS-based PV window prototype, according to the expression Pmax = FF·Isc·Voc·β. For the efficiency change under low light conditions, we introduced correction factor β, adapted from literature. β reflects the consolidated efficiency change under low illumination conditions, contributed both by FF and Voc. The short circuit current, Isc, was derived from our simulations for QY = 0.5, c-factor = 0.78 for the aspect ratio = 0.01, G = 25, and FF and Voc taken from the literature for each cell. We noted that, in an ideal case, CdTe solar cells attached to the edges of a 100 × 100 mm PV window could produce ≈41 mW at T = 90% and ≈95 mW at T = 70% for QY = 0.5 (by 80 mW cm−2 incident AM1.5 spectrum). The power almost doubled with a QY of 0.9. The values of c-Si corresponded to 34 and 85 mW for QY = 0.5, and 58 and 163 mW for QY = 0.9. Although the values of CdTe and c-Si were similar, CdTe solar cell showed better performance. One reason for this might be the input data, which used a CdTe EQE curve adapted from the literature for a cell, but might differ (decrease) slightly in Isc, Voc, and FF in the complete module. For c-Si, we used an EQE curve measured using a commercially available cell. Another reason could be the different QDs that should be used for different systems. For example, for the CdTe system, the best performance can be achieved with QDs that emit close to 700 nm. However, as discussed, the corresponding spectral profile of the QDs would introduce a color tone to the PV window. For c-Si, the optimal region was 875–955 nm. Along with emission, the absorption spectra were changed in our method (see Fig. 2 and method description), which may result in slightly more favorable conditions for CdTe solar cells. Further reason is the high Voc and optimized EQE of the CdTe cells, which provide better power conversion. CZTS and a-Si solar cells would produce lower amounts of energy. Another drawback of the a-Si solar cell is poor spectral matching for the condition of a colorless PV window to be fulfilled.
To evaluate the overall system performance for the modelled prototype, the optical efficiency, η (η = Pproduced/Pincident), for different system parameters was calculated (Table 1). For maximal produced power, Pmax, at QY = 0.9 the concentration factor exceeded 1 and was close to 1.4, which should cause an increase in the cell efficiency for most semiconductor solar cells, but may worsen the solar cell long-term performance, especially in systems with an a-Si absorber.50 We found that optimized systems for c-Si or CdTe solar cells could have optical efficiencies exceeding 2% in 70% transparent windows, which is promising for future applications. As discussed in the literature, the self-absorption effect in solar concentrators and PV windows can sufficiently suppress system performance.19,29,33 In the case of CIS or ZCIS QDs, this detrimental effect is sufficiently reduced, but not eliminated, due to the large Stokes shift, compared with CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs.25 However, for the 100 × 100 mm window, self-absorption still reduced the energy transfer by a factor of approx. 1.1–1.7 for QY = 0.5, depending on the spectral emission–absorption profile of the given particles and the QY (in our experience, the absorption overlap is higher in the blue region and decreases toward the NIR). To fabricate the simulated device on a 1 m2-scale, substantial experimental effort should be made toward overcoming parasitic losses, firstly by solving the QY drop problem in QD-based luminescent composites.

Conclusions
We assessed the potential application of CuInS2-based QDs in photovoltaic windows as a passive source of clean energy for building-integrated technologies. Using Monte Carlo ray tracing simulations, we defined the optimal spectral regions of QD emissions for c-Si, a-Si, CdTe, and CZTS solar cells at the edges of an environmentally friendly PV window prototype. We analyzed the influence of window transmittance, PLQY of the QDs, and window geometry on the photocurrent and power of simulated devices based on spectral profiles of CuInS2 QDs obtained by colloidal synthesis. Our calculations showed that the power produced by a 100 × 100 mm CIS QD-based PV window prototype can reach up to 85–95 mW with an optical performance of 1.1–1.2%, assuming a QY of 0.5 and 70% average transmittance in the visible region, which can be increased to 175 mW (2.2% optical performance) if the QY can be boosted to 0.9 (incident AM1.5G 80 mW cm−2 Sun spectrum). The design of the PV window should find a compromise between the tendencies toward increased thickness, which improves the photoresponse, and decreased concentration factor, which reduces the solar cell efficiency. By transferring the transmitted spectrum to the color space, we defined the color of the light behind the window (as delivered to the consumer) and found that QDs with an emission maximum at λ > 795 nm provided inside illumination conditions closest to white light. This imposed restrictions on the choice of appropriate solar cells attached to the edges. We found that the c-Si solar cell was the optimal choice for this purpose. Finally, the results showed that the modeled PV windows can be a useful passive energy source. The vital condition is improving the QY of semitransparent composite materials based on QDs in specified spectral regions.
