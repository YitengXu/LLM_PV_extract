    , Accepted 13th December 2019First published on 13th December 2019AbstractThe development of a highly active, long-lasting, and cost-effective electrocatalyst as an alternative to platinum (Pt) is a vital issue for the commercialization of dye-sensitized solar cells. In this study, Ru–N-doped template-free mesoporous carbon (Ru–N-TMC) was prepared by the direct stabilization and carbonization of the poly(butyl acrylate)-b-polyacrylonitrile (PBA-b-PAN) block copolymer and ruthenium(III) acetylacetonate [Ru(acac)3]. During the stabilization process, microphase separation occurred in the PBA-b-PAN block copolymer due to the incompatibility between the two blocks, and the PAN block transformed to N-doped semi-graphitic carbon. In the carbonization step, the PBA block was eliminated as a porous template, creating hierarchal mesopores/micropores. Meanwhile, Ru(acac)3 was decomposed to Ru, which was homogeneously distributed over the carbon substrate and anchored through N and O heteroatoms. The resulting Ru–N-TMC showed ultra-low charge transfer resistance (Rct = 0.034 Ω cm2) in the Co(bipyridine)33+/2+ reduction reaction, indicating very high electrocatalytic ability. Even though it is a transparent counter electrode (CE, average visible transmittance of 42.25%), covering a small fraction of the fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)/glass substrate with Ru–N-TMC, it led to lower charge transfer resistance (Rct = 0.55 Ω cm2) compared to Pt (Rct = 1.00 Ω cm2). The Ru–N-TMC counter electrode exhibited a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.42% compared to Pt (11.16%) when employed in SGT-021/Co(bpy)33+/2+ based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Furthermore, a remarkable PCE of 10.13% and 8.64% from front and rear illumination, respectively, was obtained when the Ru–N-TMC counter electrode was employed in a bifacial DSSC. The outstanding catalytic activity and PCE of Ru–N-TMC were due to the high surface area of Ru–N-TMC, which contained numerous active species (Ru and N), easily facilitated to redox ions through the hierarchical microporous/mesoporous structure.
1. Introduction
Energy is essential to achieving sustainable development goals, such as the elimination of poverty through improvements in education, health, water supply, and industrial development, and energy demands are gradually increasing. However, producing energy from a clean source is the biggest difficulty of the current century.1,2 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are some of the most common emerging photovoltaics (PVs) because of their facile fabrication process, low cost, mechanical durability, transparency, and environmental friendliness.3,4 Furthermore, their outstanding performance under low-light conditions in comparison with other solar cell technologies makes them the best alternative for smart windows in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs).5–7 Bifacial DSSCs can utilize both indoor and outdoor light when used as BIPVs for windows. A typical DSSC consists of three major parts: a photoelectrode, a redox mediator, and a counter electrode (CE). The photoelectrode generates photocurrent by absorbing light, the CE collects photoelectrons from the outer circuit and transmits them to the redox mediator, and the redox mediator shuttles the electrons from the CE to the photoelectrode. The redox couple and the CE have a crucial role in the practical use of bifacial DSSCs in BIPVs. Cobalt complexes are considered a good choice as redox mediators in bifacial DSSCs since I−/I3− redox mediators have higher light absorption properties at shorter wavelengths compared to the Co(bpy)33+/2+ redox couple.8,9 Furthermore, the relatively negative redox potential of I−/I3− redox mediators limits the efficiency of DSSCs under indoor conditions.10 On the other hand, platinum (Pt) is the most extensively employed CE11 for DSSCs since it satisfies most of the requirements. Nevertheless, the instability and high price of Pt restrict its application as a CE in commercial DSSCs. Hence, developing a Pt-free CE for DSSCs for cobalt(III)/(II)-based DSSCs is indispensable. A model CE for bifacial DSSCs should be conductive, with high catalytic activity, so that a small fraction of the active materials is sufficient to reduce the redox mediator ensuring high transparency with low charge-transfer resistance.
Recently, different conductive polymers,12–18 alloys,19–22 carbonaceous materials,23–26 and their composites27–33 have been employed as transparent CEs in bifacial DSSCs. Although a thin film of a polymer material provides very good transparency properties, it suffers from serious stability problems. Carbonaceous materials are considered attractive CEs since they are highly stable and cost-effective, with excellent catalytic properties and conductivity, providing low charge-transfer resistance. However, their catalytic activity is not high enough to fabricate a transparent CE by covering a small fraction of an FTO/glass substrate with them. Therefore, a composite of different carbonaceous materials, which provides very high catalytic activity, is the best candidate for use as a CE in bifacial DSSCs.
Nitrogen (N)-doped porous carbon materials are the most attractive substrates for metal–carbon catalysts since the N atom can increase the conductivity and electronic interactions between the metal and carbon, therefore, enhancing the catalytic activity through the polarity effect.34–41 Ru@N-doped carbon catalysts show superior performance in numerous applications, such as hydrogenolysis, the hydrogen evolution reaction, Li–O2 batteries,42 and oxygen and CO2 reduction reactions. For instance, Liu et al.43 synthesized N-doped mesoporous carbon-supported ruthenium clusters by ball milling the ruthenium precursor, mesoporous carbon, and melamine for an effective hydrogen evolution reaction. Minghui et al.44 prepared Ru catalysts for hydrogenation, embedded on N-doped hierarchical porous carbon by reducing RuCl3 with NaBH4 on a carbon substrate. An alternative way to prepare metal supported on N-doped carbon catalysts is by direct pyrolysis of carbon, nitrogen, and metal precursors. Li et al.45 synthesized N-doped carbon-supported Ru catalysts for hydrogenolysis by directly heating melamine, D-glucosamine hydrochloride, and RuCl3; however, the surface area of this composite material was very low.
Herein, we prepared Ru- and N-doped template-free mesoporous carbon (Ru–N-TMC) by direct carbonization of ruthenium(III) acetylacetonate [Ru(acac)3] with poly(butyl acrylate)-b-polyacrylonitrile (PBA-b-PAN). During the heating process, the PAN-block turned into N-doped semi-graphitic carbon, while the PBA-block was sacrificed, generating interconnected mesopores/micropores. In our previous study, we thoroughly investigated different loading amounts of Ru in the composite materials used in a supercapacitor.46 In this study, we employed Ru–N-TMC (containing 0.2 at% Ru) as the CE in a DSSC and found that Ru–N-TMC showed ultra-low charge-transfer resistance (Rct = 0.034 Ω cm2) in the Co(bpy)33+/2+ reduction reaction, indicating facile electron transfer at the electrolyte/electrode interface. Even though it is a transparent CE of Ru–N-TMC with an average visible transmittance (AVT, from 380 nm to 750 nm) of 42.25%, covering a small fraction of the FTO/glass substrate, it displayed a lower charge-transfer resistance compared to Pt. The Ru–N-TMC counter electrode exhibited a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.42% compared to Pt (11.16%) when employed in typical SGT-021/Co(bpy)33+/2+ based DSSCs. Furthermore, Ru–N-TMC provided a remarkable PCE of 10.13% and 8.64% for front illumination and rear illumination, respectively, in a bifacial DSSC. According to our knowledge, this is the highest PCE for a bifacial DSSC.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Preparation and characterisation

Fig. 1 schematically shows the steps in the preparation of Ru–N-TMC from Ru(acac)3 and the PBA-b-PAN block copolymer. First, 2 g of the PBA-b-PAN block copolymer was mixed with 0.1 g of Ru(acac)3 in 8 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) and stirred until a homogeneous solution was formed, as shown in Fig. 1a. Then, the solvent was removed from the mixture by an electrospinning process, as shown in Fig. 1b. Next, the as-obtained mixture was stabilized at 280 °C for 2 h before carbonization at 900 °C for 30 min under air and N2 gas flow, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1c. N-TMC was prepared by the same process without the addition of Ru precursor and without electrospinning.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to record the weight loss of the PBA-b-PAN block copolymer during the thermal processes. Fig. 2a shows that the PBA-b-PAN block copolymer lost 20% of its weight during the stabilization steps, owing to cross-linking in PAN and partial dehydrogenation. Another 40% weight loss at the carbonization steps between the temperatures 350 and 420 °C was due to the elimination of PBA. Furthermore 10% weight loss after 420 °C was due to the further dehydrogenation and partial denitrogenation of PAN. However, the mixture of Ru(acac)3 and PBA-b-PAN showed 5% weight loss before the stabilization step due to the conversion of Ru(acac)3 to RuO2. This was confirmed by the TGA analysis of Ru(acac)3. The TGA curve of Ru(acac)3 showed that it decomposed around 260 °C. Even though RuO2 was formed during the stabilization period under air flow, it was transformed to Ru at elevated temperatures in the presence of N2.47

The mesoporous properties and specific surface area of N-TMC and Ru–N-TMC were evaluated by N2 adsorption measurements. Fig. 2b displays the N2 adsorption isotherms of N-TMC and Ru–N-TMC, and their analogous parameters are listed in Table S1.† The H1 hysteresis loop and type IV isotherms of N-TMC and Ru–N-TMC indicated that both contained mesoporous structures with very high uniformity of pore-size and ready pore connectivity.48,49 The pore size, pore volume, and overall surface area of Ru–N-TMC were higher than those of N-TMC, which may be due to the increasing local microphase separation and facile elimination of the PBA-block after electrospinning.
The presence of functional groups in the PBA-b-PAN block copolymer and N-TMC was evaluated by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Fig. S1†). Sharp absorption peaks between 1000 and 1450 cm−1 were observed for the polymer, owing to the stretching frequency of C–O and C–H bonds. Conversely, a wide absorption peak due to the stretching frequency of the C–O bond was detected for N-TMC. In the range of 2260–2240 cm−1 and 1750–1730 cm−1, the polymer sample showed strong absorption peaks corresponding to CN and CO, respectively. However, CN and CO absorption peaks disappeared in N-TMC, and a new absorption peak corresponding to CN stretching frequencies was detected at 1690–1640 cm−1. Due to absorbed water, an O–H stretching peak at 3400–3200 cm−1 was detected in both the polymer and N-TMC.
Surface texture and the porosity of N-TMC and Ru–N-TMC were evaluated by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Fig. 3a and b show the bi-continuous, three-dimensional structure of N-TMC with mesopores. Furthermore, the TEM images show the continuous, uniform, nanoporous structure of N-TMC, Fig. 3c and d. The homogeneous distribution of N and O heteroatoms in N-TMC was confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping (Fig. 3e–h).

In contrast to N-TMC, Ru–N-TMC showed a spherical structure (see Fig. 3h). Moreover, the high-magnification SEM image of Ru–N-TMC shows that after electrospinning the porosity of Ru–N-TMC increased (Fig. 3i). During electrospinning, viscoelastic confinement by surface tension formed a sphere-shaped drop of the Ru(acac)3 and polymer mixture. This fine spherical shape facilitated the easy removal of the PBA block and the shape remains unchanged after heating processes. The HAADF-STEM images of Ru–N-TMC show the uniform, nanoporous, bi-continuous structure of Ru–N-TMC (Fig. 3j). The uniform distribution of Ru through the carbon matrix was confirmed by the image of high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) (see Fig. 3k). High magnification HAADF-STEM images specify that Ru particle sizes vary from subnanometre to a few nanometre scale (Fig. 3l). Furthermore, EDX mapping confirmed homogeneous distribution of the component elements and the presence of 0.2, 6.8, 3.50, and 89.5 at% of Ru, O, N, and C, respectively (see Fig. 3m–p and Table S2†).
Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were taken to study the degree of crystallinity in the studied samples. SAED patterns of N-TMC showed diffused diffraction rings, indicating an amorphous structure (Fig. 4a). Ru–N-TMC also showed similar diffused diffraction rings, indicating amorphous Ru particles or a smaller particle size of Ru, which was not enough to reflect any diffraction spots or rings except a halo around the bright spot in the centre (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy were used to investigate the crystalline structure of the studied samples. Wide diffraction peaks were observed for N-TMC, assigned to the (002) and (100) crystal planes of graphitic carbon at 25° and 44°, representing the disordered and amorphous structure of N-TMC. On the other hand, Ru–N-TMC did not show any other diffraction peaks except the (002) and (100) planes of graphitic carbon, confirming the presence of amorphous Ru with a smaller particle size (Fig. 4c).50 The Raman spectrum of N-TMC showed two separate peaks, a defect-induced peak (D band) at 1350 cm−1 and an in-plane vibrational graphitic-induced peak (G band) at 1590 cm−1. However, the Raman spectrum of Ru–N-TMC, similar to the SAED and XRD data, did not show any reflection of the Ru crystal structure. The ID/IG ratio of N-TMC and Ru–N-TMC was 1.16, specifying the existence of a significant amount of defect sites in the semi-graphitic structure (Fig. 4d).

The elemental compositions and nature of the chemical bonds in the samples were explored by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The presence of O, N, C and Ru in the investigated materials was confirmed by XPS analysis, and the overall composition is summarized in Table S2.† The N 1s spectrum of N-TMC was deconvoluted into four separate peaks at 402.34 eV, 400.64 eV, 400.24 eV, and 397.89 eV, corresponding to pyridinic–N oxide, quaternary/graphitic–N, pyrrolic–N, and pyridinic–N, respectively (see Fig. 5a). N heteroatoms (mostly graphitic–N and pyridinic–N) in the carbon matrix accelerated the electrocatalytic performance through their wettability and charge-transfer capability.51 Furthermore, N heteroatoms increased the interactions between carbon and the metal, acting as the metallic coordination site.50,52 Deconvolution of the N 1s spectra of Ru–N-TMC also showed four different peaks; however, the peaks were shifted to higher binding energies (pyridinic–N oxide at 402.59 eV, quaternary/graphitic–N at 400.78 eV, pyrrolic–N at 400.68 eV, and pyridinic–N at 398.11 eV), indicating the formation of coordination bonds of N atoms with Ru (Fig. 5b).52Fig. 5c shows the percentage of four different nitrogen species and their possible bonding configurations in N-TMC and Ru–N-TMC. Deconvolution of the O 1s spectra of N-TMC showed three peaks at 534.83, 532.67, and 530.80 eV, corresponding to –C–O, –O–H, and –CO bonds, respectively (Fig. 5d). However, Ru–N-TMC showed an extra peak corresponding to the C–O–Ru bond at 529.77 eV, in addition to three peaks, corresponding to, –C–O, –O–H, and –CO bonds (Fig. 5e). As usual, the bonding nature of Ru with other elements was analyzed by deconvolution of the 3d photoelectron spectra. However, here we deconvoluted the 3p spectrum of Ru to avoid strong interference of the C 1s spectrum with Ru 3d (Fig. S2†). The deconvoluted Ru 3p spectrum of Ru–N-TMC displayed two peaks at 462.51 and 485.26 eV, corresponding to two splitting orbitals, 3p3/2 and 3p1/2, of Ru(II)–C/N/O bonds, and two other peaks at 464.89 and 486.74 eV, corresponding to splitting orbitals 3p3/2 and 3p1/2 of Ru(IV)–C/N/O bonds, respectively (Fig. 5f). Investigation of the XPS spectra clearly confirmed that Ru was incorporated and monodispersed in the carbon substrate through –C–O–Ru/–C–N–Ru bond formation. Since EDX and XPS can investigate surface components, the actual amounts of the different elements were confirmed by elemental analysis (EA), showing 1.18, 12.29, 4.89, and 81.64 wt% of Ru, O, N, and C, respectively, in Ru–N-TMC (Table S2†).

2.2. Fabrication of typical dye-sensitized solar cells
To study the electrocatalytic properties of the materials, CEs were first fabricated by depositing 0.8 mL of the materials onto the FTO/glass substrate using the e-spray (electrostatic spray) technique (Fig. S3†). Then, symmetric dummy cells were fabricated using the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox mediator, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarisation curves were used to investigate the electrocatalytic performances of the electrode materials. A typical Pt CE fabricated by drop-casting was employed as a reference electrode for comparison.
EIS is used to investigate the interfacial and electrochemical properties of CEs, with the assistance of an equivalent circuit (see Fig. S4†). The Nyquist plots of the studied electrodes were fitted to the equivalent circuit, and the fitted EIS parameters are summarized in Table 1. On the real axis, the cut-off point of the Nyquist spectra, in the high-frequency range, corresponds to the equivalent series resistance (Rs), as shown in Fig. 6a. The first semicircle, in the high-frequency area, corresponds to the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) and the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrolyte/electrode interface. In the low-frequency area, the second semicircle denotes the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the bulk electrolyte flanked by the two electrodes.

The Rs values of the N-TMC, Ru–N-TMC, and Pt CEs were 1.22, 1.18, and 1.50 Ω cm2, respectively, indicating small internal and contact resistance of Ru–N-TMC. Furthermore, the Rct value of the Ru–N-TMC electrode was very low (Rct = 0.034 Ω cm2) compared to the N-TMC (Rct = 0.24 Ω cm2) and Pt (Rct = 1.00 Ω cm2) electrodes, indicating the better catalytic ability of Ru–N-TMC. The overall resistance (Rs + Rct + ZN), especially Rct, critically affects the PCE of DSSCs. To inhibit electron loss at the CE, the redox couple reduction rate at the cathode and the dye regeneration rate at the photoanode should be comparable, i.e., the photocurrent density (Jsc) should be equivalent to the exchange current density (Jo) at the CE. According to the definition of exchange current density (Jo): Jo = RT/nFRct(1)where R, T are F are constant, and n is the number of exchanged electrons at the electrolyte/electrode interface. Thus, the exchange current density (Jo) increases with decreasing Rct of the CE.
In Tafel polarization curves the steeper slope, when approaching the plateau at the Tafel zone, for the Ru–N-TMC electrode compared to N-TMC and Pt electrodes specified a larger exchange current density (Jo) at the electrolyte/electrode interface due to the better catalytic activity (Fig. 6b). Also, the higher limiting current density (Jlim) for Ru–N-TMC indicated faster diffusion of the electrolyte to the Ru–N-TMC electrode.
Furthermore, the electrocatalytic performance of the electrodes was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (see Fig. S5†). Fig. 6c shows comparable peak-to-peak separation (ΔEpp) for all electrodes; however, the Ru–N-TMC electrode had a comparatively higher peak current compared to N-TMC and Pt electrodes, illustrating greater electroactive area and faster charge transference at the electrolyte/electrode interface. Furthermore, the steeper slope (m) of the linear relationship of the square root of scan rates and redox peak currents indicated that Ru–N-TMC had higher electrocatalytic activity towards the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox mediator.
After assessing the dummy cell, typical DSSC devices were fabricated using the SGT-021 sensitizer (absorbed into double layered-TiO2) and the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox couple, with Pt, N-TMC, and Ru–N-TMC counter electrodes.53Fig. 7a displays the current–density–voltage (J–V) curves of the corresponding DSSCs, and their corresponding parameters are listed in Table 1. The DSSC equipped with the Pt counter electrode displayed a PCE of 11.16% with a fill factor (FF) of 76.01, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 822.10 mV, and a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.86 mA cm−2. As expected, the DSSCs with N-TMC and Ru–N-TMC counter electrodes showed a greater PCE. The N-TMC-based DSSC displayed a PCE of 11.36%, with a FF of 76.10%, a Voc of 824.26 mV, and a Jsc of 18.11 mA cm−2. Conversely, the Ru–N-TMC-based DSSC displayed a PCE of 11.42%, with a FF of 76.10%, a Voc of 824.81 mV, and a Jsc of 18.20 mA cm−2. Fig. S6† shows the typical incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) characteristics of porphyrin sensitizer-based DSSCs and similar trends with the J–V curves.53 Furthermore, EIS of the DSSCs was measured under dark conditions from 1 × 106 to 0.1 Hz at potentials equivalent to the Voc of the cells. Fig. 7b shows that the Rct values of the DSSCs and the symmetrical dummy cells were consistent, indicating that the higher PCE of N-TMC- and Ru–N-TMC-based DSSCs was due to their lower Rct values.

(b) Nyquist spectra of the DSSC devices in the high-frequency range, measured under dark conditions. (c) Nyquist spectra displaying the electrochemical stability of the Ru–N-TMC counter electrode (inset; Pt counter electrode) under applied potential on dummy cells. (d) Charge-transfer resistance (Rct) changes for Pt and Ru–N-TMC counter electrodes vs. the EIS scan number. 
The long-term durability of the electrode materials was determined by taking a freshly prepared symmetric dummy cell and exposing to 100 CV cycles and then EIS was carried out. The aforementioned measurement was completed 10 times repetitively to ensure electrochemical stability up to 1000 cycles. As shown in Fig. 7c, the first arc (Rct) of the Pt counter electrode was considerably augmented from the initial to last cycle, but that of the Ru–N-TMC counter electrode was marginally changed. The Rct values of Pt and Ru–N-TMC in the first cycle were 1.00 and 0.034 Ω cm2, respectively. However, after the final cycle the Rct value of Pt was around 68.88 Ω cm2, while it was only 1.12 Ω cm2 for Ru–N-TMC, indicating superior stability of Ru–N-TMC in the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox mediator.
2.3. Semi-transparent Ru–N-TMC electrodes for bifacial DSSCs
Since carbonaceous materials are not transparent, when making a semi-transparent electrode a small fraction of the transparent FTO/glass substrate should be covered by the carbonaceous material. Accordingly, the catalytic activity of the active materials must be high enough to fabricate a semi-transparent CE. Since Ru–N-TMC shows ultra-low charge-transfer resistance to the Co(bpy)32+/3+ reduction reaction, we have fabricated a semi-transparent CE of Ru–N-TMC for bifacial DSSCs. Three different semi-transparent CEs, denoted as Ru–N-TMC-x (x = 0.04, 0.05, and 0.06 mL, indicates the loading amount of Ru–N-TMC), were fabricated by depositing 0.04 mL, 0.05 mL, and 0.06 mL of Ru–N-TMC by controlling the spray time. Fig. 8a shows the transmittance properties of bare FTO/glass substrate, Pt, and Ru–N-TMC electrodes with different thicknesses. The AVT (from 380 nm to 750 nm) of the FTO/glass substrate and Pt electrode was 74.44 and 60.13%, respectively. Fig. 8b shows that the Pt electrode was slightly opaque; however, the Ru–N-TMC electrodes were more opaque compared to Pt, and their opacity increased with increasing loading amounts of Ru–N-TMC. The AVT values of Ru–N-TMC-0.04, Ru–N-TMC-0.05, and Ru–N-TMC-0.06 electrodes were 51.54, 47.74, and 42.25%, respectively. The SEM images of the Pt and Ru–N-TMC-0.06 electrodes showed consistency in the transmittance values of the electrodes, confirming that the surface of the FTO/glass substrate covered by Ru–N-TMC-0.06 was higher compared to Pt (Fig. 8c and d).

Before application in real DSSC devices, the electrocatalytic ability of the semi-transparent CEs was also confirmed by EIS, CV, and Tafel polarization and was compared with that of Pt. Fig. 9a shows the Nyquist plots of Ru–N-TMC-x electrodes. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) and series resistance (Rs) of the electrodes increased with a decrease in the deposited amount of Ru–N-TMC. However, all electrodes showed lower series resistance than Pt, indicating good adhesion properties of the materials with the FTO/glass substrate and better conductivity compared to Pt. Conversely, the charge transfer resistance of Ru–N-TMC-0.06 (Rct = 0.55 Ω cm2) and Ru–N-TMC-0.05 (Rct = 0.55 Ω cm2), except Ru–N-TMC-0.04 (Rct = 0.95 Ω cm2), was lower than that of Pt, illustrating the better catalytic activity of Ru–N-TMC-0.06 and Ru–N-TMC-0.05 compared to Pt. The Tafel polarization curve in Fig. 9b shows that the tangent approaching the plateau at the Tafel zone became steeper with an increase in the loading amount of Ru–N-TMC, which is consistent with the Rct values. Furthermore, the limiting current density (Jlim) values of Ru–N-TMC-0.06 and Ru–N-TMC-0.05 were a little higher than that of Pt, but Ru–N-TMC-0.04 exhibited a slightly lower limiting current density (Jlim) compared to that of Pt. CVs of Ru–N-TMC-x were taken at scan rates from 50 to 200 mV s−1 (Fig. S7†). In Fig. 9c, the CV at 100 mV s−1 shows that Ru–N-TMC-0.06 and Ru–N-TMC-0.05 had sharp oxidation/reduction humps and small peak-to-peak distances with very high peak currents, which are comparable to Pt. However, Ru–N-TMC-0.04 showed a broader peak and greater peak-to-peak separation with a smaller peak current compared to other electrodes. The steeper slope (m) of the linear relationship of the square root of scan rates and oxidation and reduction peak currents illustrates that Ru–N-TMC-0.06 (m = 0.07) and Ru–N-TMC-0.05 (m = 0.06) counter electrodes have almost similar catalytic ability to the Pt (m = 0.07) counter electrode at a higher scan rate (Fig. 9c).

For measuring transmittance and photovoltaic properties of the bifacial DSSCs, a single-layered TiO2 photoanode (3 μm), immersed in SGT-021 sensitizer,53 was assembled with the semi-transparent CEs using the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox shuttle, as depicted in Fig. 10a. Fig. 10b displays the J–V curves, and their corresponding parameters are listed in Table 2. Remarkably, all DSSCs with different CEs displayed outstanding PCEs. For the Pt counter electrode, the PCE was 9.76%, with a FF of 75.51%, a Voc of 855.24 mV, and a Jsc of 15.11 mA cm−2, for front illumination, but the PCE was reduced to 8.78% (with FF = 75.15%, Voc = 848.28 mV, and Jsc = 13.78 mA cm−2) for rear illumination. The decrease in the PCE for back-side illumination was due to the decrease in light intensity due to the longer distance that the light travelled through the CE and the redox shuttle. The incident light was also scattered, reflected, and deflected when passing through the CE and redox shuttle. That is the reason why, back illumination generates lower photocurrent, as reflected by the J–V curves, showing inferior Jsc values for back-illumination in all cases. In contrast, when the Pt counter electrode was substituted with Ru–N-TMC-0.06 and Ru–N-TMC-0.05 electrodes, the PCE for front illumination improved significantly. But, Ru–N-TMC-0.04 had an inferior PCE for both front illumination and back illumination. For front illumination, Ru–N-TMC-0.06 and Ru–N-TMC-0.05 had PCEs of 10.13% (with FF = 80.15%, Voc = 851.02 mV, and Jsc = 14.90 mA cm−2) and 9.92% (with FF = 78.50%, Voc = 849.97 mV, and Jsc = 14.86 mA cm−2), respectively. Of note, the PCE of the Ru–N-TMC-0.06 based bifacial DSSC outperformed the previously reported values (Table S3†).48 However, the PCEs with Ru–N-TMC-0.06 and Ru–N-TMC-0.05 counter electrodes for back illumination were not manifested by their higher catalytic activities compared to the Pt counter electrode. This was due to the lower transmittance properties of Ru–N-TMC-0.06 and Ru–N-TMC-0.05 electrodes compared to the Pt electrode. The IPCE spectra of the bifacial DSSCs were recorded from front-side and rear-side irradiation. Fig. 10c shows that bifacial DSSCs have an IPCE in a narrower wavelength range compared to typical DSSCs. The IPCE of the bifacial DSSCs was zero percent before 320 nm, indicating zero light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), although the SGT-021 sensitizer has sufficient light absorption properties in this region. This may be due to the absence of the scattering TiO2 layer, which may decrease the interaction time between the incident photon and the sensitizer and allow incident light to be absorbed by the redox mediator. Since the Co(bpy)32+/3+ electrolyte has strong light absorption properties13 below 380 nm and the CE scatters or reflects light, the IPCE wavelength for rear illumination of the bifacial DSSCs was further narrowed in the shorter wavelength region. However, the IPCE spectra showed a similar trend with J–V curves and consistency with the catalytic performance of the CEs. Fig. 10d shows the analogous trend of the EIS spectra of the bifacial DSSCs in the high-frequency region, measured under dark conditions from 1 × 106 to 0.1 Hz at potentials equivalent to the Voc of the cells. This illustrates that higher PCEs in the devices are due to the lower Rct values, as a lower Rct value allows the electrons to move faster from the conduction band of the TiO2 semiconductor to the redox mediator through the CE and reduces the recombination.

Fig. 11a shows the transmittance properties of the photoanode and bifacial DSSCs. The plain TiO2 photoanode (without dye) had an AVT of 71.60%. However, after dye absorption the AVT decreased abruptly to 24.26% since the SGT-021 dye has excellent light absorption capability in the range of the visible wavelength.53 As expected, when the photoanode was assembled with the CE in the bifacial DSSC, the transmittance values dropped further. The AVT of real DSSCs with Ru–N-TMC-0.06, Ru–N-TMC-0.05, Ru–N-TMC-0.04, and Pt CEs was 12.68, 13.94, 15.15, and 16.93%, respectively. Fig. 11(b–h) show the digital photographs taken with and without covering the camera lens with the photoanode and bifacial DSSCs. The background scenery can be seen clearly through all devices, indicating that all devices have sound transmittance properties and would be good choices for smart windows.

Finally, the long-term stability of the transparent electrode (Ru–N-TMC-0.06 CE) was evaluated. To obtain electrode stability, 10 CV cycles were carried out in the symmetric dummy cell at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, and then EIS measurement was taken at zero bias potential. The process was repeated 10 times to complete 100 CV cycles. As displayed in Fig. S8a,† the change in CV curves was not significant. Moreover, the increase of the Rct value after 100 CV cycles for Ru–N-TMC-0.06 was very low compared to the Pt counter electrode (see Fig. 7), indicating the very good stability of the transparent electrode (see Fig. S8b†).
3. Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated a simple method for the in situ preparation of Ru–N-doped template-free mesoporous carbon by pyrolysis of a mixture of the PBA-b-PAN block copolymer and Ru(acac)3. Ru(acac)3 mixed with the PBA-b-PAN block copolymer on a molecular level was confined in the polymer network after removing the solvent. During the thermal process, PBA-b-PAN turned into N-doped semi-graphitic carbon with mesopores/micropores, while Ru(acac)3 acted as a source of Ru. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis confirmed the presence of 0.2 at% ruthenium, which was homogeneously dispersed in the carbon matrix through N and O heteroatoms. Furthermore, SAED, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the amorphous structure of Ru particles and some particles of Ru was not large enough to reflect its crystal structure. The resulting Ru–N-TMC showed very high electrocatalytic ability in the Co(bpy)33+/2+ reduction reaction. Employing Ru–N-TMC as the CE in a typical DSSC with the Co(bpy)33+/2+ redox mediator and SGT-021 sensitizer provided a higher PCE of 11.42% compared to 11.16% for the Pt counter electrode, ensuring long-term cycling stability. Moreover, the catalytic activity of Ru–N-TMC for the Co(bpy)33+/2+ reduction reaction was bounteous to fabricate a semi-transparent Ru–N-TMC counter electrode, and when it was employed in the bifacial DSSC, remarkable PCEs of 10.13 and 8.64% were achieved for front illumination and rear illumination, respectively. The feasible preparation procedure and understanding insight properties of the Ru–N-TMC could be considered to be a novel way for designing other metal–carbon composites. Furthermore, sound transmittance properties of Ru–N-TMC signify its practical application in bifacial DSSCs used for smart windows.
4. Experimental
4.1. Materials
All chemicals were received from Sigma-Aldrich and used as obtained. The FTO/glass substrate was received from Pilkington (TEC-8).
4.2. Preparation of Ru–N-TMC
Ru–N-TMC was prepared by direct carbonization of Ru(acac)3 and the PBA-b-PAN block copolymer. PBA-b-PAN (Mn = 27958, polydispersity = 1.38, PAN fraction = 63.37 wt%), obtained from reverse atom transfer radical polymerization,54 was mixed with Ru(acac)3 in DMF and electro-spun. The obtained mixture was stabilized in the presence of air for 2 h at 280 °C and then pyrolyzed at 900 °C for 30 min under inert conditions (N2 gas passes through the tube furnace, ramp rate of 5 °C min−1). Then, the furnace was cooled down and Ru–N-TMC was obtained. N-TMC was prepared by carbonization of the PBA-b-PAN block copolymer, using the same procedure mentioned above.
4.3. Fabrication of counter electrodes (CEs)
In 2-propanol Ru–N-TMC (0.1 wt%) was homogeneously dispersed by ball milling and ultrasonicated for 20 and 30 min, respectively. Then, the resulting homogeneous mixture was uniformly sprayed by an e-spray method onto an FTO/glass substrate. Finally, the as-prepared electrodes, after sintering at 350 °C for 20 min, were used for device fabrication. The reference electrode (Pt counter electrode) was prepared by drop-casting 4.88 × 10−3 M H2PtCl6 solution of ca. 30 μL cm−2.
4.4. Cell fabrication
DSSCs were fabricated by assembling the dye-adsorbed TiO2 semi-conductor and the CEs with a 25 μm-thick Surlyn spacer, discussed in more detail elsewhere.34 The electrolyte solution of Co(bpy)3(bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide, TSFI)2 (0.125 M), Co(bpy)3(TSFI)3 (0.03 M), LiTSFI (0.05 M), and 4-tert-butyl pyridine (0.25 M) in acetonitrile was filled via vacuum backfilling through a hole on the CEs, and the hole was wrapped with a cover glass using Surlyn. Symmetrical dummy cells were fabricated by assembling two indistinguishable CEs and using the same electrolyte solution.
