    , Accepted 15th October 2018First published on 30th October 2018AbstractHeteroatom doping and surface modification with oxides are both important strategies to improve the photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities of TiO2 photoelectrodes. However, it is difficult to combine the two strategies into a single synthesis process. Herein, a simple one-pot synthesis method was developed to modify a TiO2 photoelectrode surface by N-doping while simultaneously modifying the surface with In2O3 and NiO. This method involved growing MOF onto a TiO2 surface with N-containing organic ligands and In and Ni salts as metal precursors, followed by heat treatment at 600 °C. The roles of heteroatom doping and oxide modification are proposed as follows. (i) N-Doping extends the absorption edge of the TiO2 to a longer wavelength region and enhances visible light absorption. (ii) N-Doping together with the passivation of TiO2 surface trap states by oxide modification increases the donor density in TiO2. (iii) The generated suitable interfaces on the surface of TiO2 facilitate photogenerated charge separation and transfer. In comparison with the pristine TiO2 photoelectrode, the metal oxide- and heteroatom-modified TiO2 photoelectrode exhibits superior photoelectrochemical performance under both simulated sunlight and visible light illumination. Suitable substrate of the electrode, appropriate size of the as-synthesized MOF precursors, and choice of ligands and metal ions are important factors for this strategy.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical water splitting is a promising method to convert solar energy into chemical energy, which is critical for maintaining a sustainable and clean energy supply.1,2 Among many photocatalysts, the TiO2-based photoelectrode has attracted much interest because of its suitable band structure, stability, low cost and low toxicity.3–6 Many attempts have been made to improve the reactivity of the TiO2 photoelectrode, such as doping,7–9 using co-catalysts,10–12 fabricating heterostructures13 and morphology control.14–16 However, due to its low electron and hole separation efficiency and low visible light absorption, it remains a challenge for TiO2 to be applied in photoelectrochemical water splitting.
In comparison with pure TiO2, surface modified TiO2 shows improved photoelectrochemical activities. For example, Li et al. treated TiO2 nanowires with hydrogen to form oxygen vacancies on the surface of TiO2. With the increase in the donor density, these oxygen vacancies enhanced the photocurrent of the TiO2 photoelectrode.17 Mullins et al. synthesized N-modified TiO2 nanowires with cobalt as a co-catalyst. By doping and co-catalyst modification, the photoelectrochemical performance was enhanced both in ultraviolet and visible light regions.18 Lin et al. deposited Cu2O on the surface of TiO2 nanotube arrays to form the p–n junction. As a result, the separation of photoinduced holes and electrons was improved and the Cu2O/TiO2 hybrid photoelectrode exhibited excellent performance.19 Thus far, great progress has been made in TiO2 surface modification. However, modifying the TiO2 surface with multiple heteroatoms and metal oxides simultaneously is still a challenging task for specific applications.
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are a type of porous materials with unique atomic ordering.20,21 MOFs can be constructed with different organic ligands and metal ions. Because of their diverse chemical compositions and tunable structures, these MOFs are considered to be promising materials for many applications, including CO2 capture, catalysis and energy conversion and storage. The flexible chemical composition of MOFs also makes them ideal precursors for modifying the surface of TiO2 photoelectrodes with complex compositions and structures for different functionalities.
From the synthesis point view, two key strategies need to be considered to use MOF as a precursor to induce surface modification of TiO2 for improving its photoelectrochemical properties. First, a suitable TiO2 substrate must be synthesized for hosting the MOF material. Second, the surfaces of the MOF precursors must be deposited with proper metallic and nonmetallic elements. Based on the abovementioned considerations, first, we synthesized a Ti3+ doped TiO2 substrate.6 The presence of Ti3+ could lead to more surface defects, which may enhance the interaction of the ligands in the MOF precursor solution with the TiO2 surface. Second, we deposited an MOF with In and Ni metal ions and 1,2,4-triazolate as the ligand containing N atom.22 Our study involved two strategies: (i) construction of Ti3+ and N co-doped TiO2 combined with the deposition of specific metal oxides on the surface to enhance the light absorption and (ii) construction of suitable interfaces (TiO2/In2O3/NiO) to promote the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs for the TiO2 photoelectrode.
Applying the above strategies, a metal oxide- and heteroatom-modified TiO2-based photoelectrode named InNi/N/TiO2 was successfully synthesized. The loading status of the MOF precursors could be controlled by varying the synthesis conditions. The modifications derived using MOFs of different chemical compositions help in tuning the surface electronic structure, properties of charge separation and transfer and photoelectrochemical activities of TiO2. Compared with the pristine TiO2 photoelectrode, the photoelectrochemical performance of the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode was significantly enhanced.
Results and discussion
The synthesis process for InNi/N/TiO2 is illustrated in Scheme 1. First, the Ti3+-doped rutile TiO2 electrode was synthesized using a modified procedure from our previous study.6 Then, the TiO2 electrode was immersed in a solution containing MOF precursors (In3+, Ni2+, 1,2,4-triazol and terephthalic acid). With subsequent solvothermal treatment, the InNi-MOF grew on the surface of TiO2 (InNi-MOF/TiO2). After a thermal treatment at 600 °C in N2 atmosphere, InNi-MOF decomposed and the In2O3- and NiO-modified rutile TiO2 electrode with co-doping of N and Ti3+ was obtained.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the TiO2 electrode, InNi-MOF/TiO2 electrode and InNi/N/TiO2 electrode are shown in Fig. 1. The as-prepared TiO2 on the surface of the Ti foil is rutile TiO2. The XRD pattern of InNi-MOF/TiO2 is shown in Fig. 1a. The diffraction peak at 8.8° and 12.8° can be indexed to (00) and (20) facets of InNi-MOF, which confirm the formation of InNi-MOF on the surface of TiO2. In comparison, the XRD pattern (Fig. 1b) of the electrode annealed at 600 °C (InNi/N/TiO2) shows no phases except for the rutile TiO2 and Ti metal. This is because the small amount of oxides derived from the pyrolysis of the InNi-MOFs is below the measurable limit of XRD characterization.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the TiO2 electrode are shown in Fig. S1.† Most of the rutile TiO2 crystals grown on the Ti foil are rectangular pyramids with four {110} facets in the middle parts and four {111} facets on the top of the crystals.23 The surfaces of the rectangular pyramids are very smooth without additional clusters or particles on them. The corresponding cross-sectional views of the TiO2 electrode in Fig. S1b and d† clearly show the rectangular pyramid morphology of TiO2 and the interface between the TiO2 and Ti foil substrate. The thickness of the TiO2 layer is about 2 μm. The SEM image and corresponding elemental mapping of the InNi-MOF/TiO2 electrode in Fig. 2a show a homogeneous distribution of Ti, In and Ni, indicating that the InNi-MOF particles are distributed uniformly on the TiO2 electrode. As shown in Fig. 2b and c, the InNi-MOF nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 20 nm to 100 nm were deposited on the {110} facet of TiO2 after the growth process of InNi-MOF. MOF crystals usually have large size of about several micrometers, which is disadvantageous for the light absorption of TiO2 and the transportation of the carriers. By reducing the precursor concentration and reaction time for the MOF synthesis, the InNi-MOF particles grown on the surface of TiO2 have much smaller size. This small size could be helpful in the construction of suitable heterostructures for improving the performance of the electrode. By annealing at 600 °C under N2 flow, the In2O3 and NiO nanoparticles are formed on the surface of TiO2, as shown in the SEM images in Fig. 3. The SEM image and corresponding elemental mapping of the InNi/N/TiO2 electrode in Fig. 3a also show homogeneous signals for Ti, In and Ni, which demonstrates the uniform distribution of In2O3 and NiO on the surface of TiO2 after heat treatment. In Fig. 3b and e, it is shown that the In2O3 and NiO, decomposed from InNi-MOF, are nanoparticles with smaller particle sizes than those of InNi-MOF. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the nanoparticles grown on TiO2 are shown in Fig. 3c and f. The sizes of the particles are about 15 nm to 40 nm, as shown in Fig. 3c. The high-resolution TEM image (the inner part of the white box in Fig. 3c) in Fig. 3f confirms that the particles consist of two types of oxides: In2O3 with a size of around 20 nm and NiO with a size of around 5 nm. The distinct lattice spacings of 0.29 nm and 0.21 nm observed in the two particles correspond to In2O3 (222) and NiO (200), respectively. The TEM images of In2O3, NiO and TiO2 are shown in Fig. 3d and g. It is clearly indicated that the In2O3 and NiO particles are grown on the surface of TiO2 and there is a good connection between the interface of TiO2 and In2O3 or NiO particles for the designed in situ growth process, which is beneficial for the transfer of carriers.

The surface chemical state of InNi/N/TiO2 was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Fig. 4. The high resolution XPS spectrum of Ni 2p in Fig. 4a reveals that the two peaks at 855.5 and 873.5 eV originate from Ni 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of NiO on the surface of TiO2,24,25 respectively. The binding energies of 861.5 and 879.9 eV are identified as the satellite peaks of Ni 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of NiO. As shown in Fig. 4c, the binding energies at 444.6 and 452.1 eV originate from the In 2p5/2 and 2p3/2 in In2O3,26 respectively. The N 1s signal detected in Fig. 4b confirms the existence of N species in InNi/N/TiO2. The binding energy range from 401 to 398 eV suggests the interstitial incorporation of N in TiO2 and the existence of minor molecularly chemisorbed N2 species.27,28 The atomic percentages of nitrogen, indium and nickel in InNi/N/TiO2 are 1%, 3.5% and 1.2%, respectively.

In comparison with the UV-visible absorption spectrum of pristine TiO2, the spectrum of InNi/N/TiO2 shows a red shift, as shown in Fig. 5a. In addition, the light absorption in the visible light region (450 nm to 800 nm) is also enhanced due to the existence of In2O3 and NiO on the surface of TiO2 compared with that observed in the spectrum of pristine TiO2.29,30 It is worth noting that the similar absorption bands of InNi/N/TiO2 and TiO2 from 420 nm to 800 nm, which are attributed to Ti3+,31 confirm the existence of Ti3+ in InNi/N/TiO2 because of the protection of nitrogen atmosphere in the heat treatment process. According to the plot of transformed Kubelka–Munk function (Fig. 5b), the bandgap of InNi/N/TiO2 is reduced to 2.88 eV compared with the bandgap of 3.03 eV of pristine TiO2. By heteroatom doping and surface modification with different oxides, the surface electronic structure of the InNi/N/TiO2 was adjusted successfully.

The photoelectrochemical activities of the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode and pristine TiO2 photoelectrode were tested in a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell using Pt foil as the counter electrode, saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode and 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6.3) as the electrolyte. The linear sweeps were first measured under 100 mW cm−2 simulated sunlight illumination from a 150 W Xenon lamp coupled with a AM 1.5G filter (see details in the Experimental section). As shown in Fig. 6a, significantly enhanced photocurrent was observed for the InNi/N/TiO2. The photocurrent density of the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode is 1.28 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. SCE, which is 2.7 times higher than that of the pristine TiO2 photoelectrode. Moreover, compared with the pristine TiO2 photoelectrode, the onset potential of the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode decreased by about 73 mV, which could be attributed to the surface modification of the oxides.32 The transient photocurrents of the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode and pristine TiO2 photoelectrode at 0.6 V vs. SCE are shown in Fig. 6b. The current densities for the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode and pristine TiO2 photoelectrode are 1.29 mA cm−2 and 0.45 mA cm−2, respectively, which match well with the data of linear sweep voltammograms. More importantly, the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode shows better performance under visible light irradiation (>400 nm, details in the Experimental section) than that of the pristine TiO2, as shown in Fig. 6c. Because the co-doping of N and Ti3+ in TiO2 induced visible light absorption, the photocurrent at 0.6 V vs. SCE for the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode increased from 52 μA cm−2 to 101 μA cm−2 compared with the pristine TiO2 photoelectrode. In addition, we measured the time-dependent photocurrent at 0.6 V under 100 mW cm−2 simulated sunlight illumination (shown in Fig. 6d). No significant attenuation of the photocurrent for about 4 hours was observed, suggesting the excellent stability of the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode.

Incident-photon-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) was determined to compare the conversion efficiency for different photoelectrodes under standard light source irradiation. IPCE can be expressed by the following equation: (1)where J is the obtained photocurrent density at a specific incident wavelength, λ is the wavelength of incident light, and E(λ) is the irradiance at a specific incident wavelength. We measured the IPCE on the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode and pristine TiO2 photoelectrode at 0.6 V vs. SCE, as shown in Fig. 7. Maximum IPCE of the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode was 83.2% at 340 nm, which is about 1.4 times higher than that of the pristine TiO2 photoelectrode. This result shows that the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode exhibits significantly improved IPCE in the UV region. Significantly, the IPCE of the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode from 400 to 420 nm is also much higher than that of the pristine TiO2 photoelectrode. This suggests that modification with N and metal oxides is an efficient method to improve the performance of the TiO2 photoelectrode in both UV and visible regions.

To further investigate how surface modification enhanced charge transfer and separation, Mott–Schottky plots were recorded and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted on the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode and pristine TiO2 photoelectrodes. As shown in Fig. 8a, the Mott–Schottky plots of both InNi/N/TiO2 and pristine TiO2 were collected with a bias of 0.6 V vs. SCE at 1 kHz under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The positive slopes in the plots are consistent with the n-type semiconductor. The Mott–Schottky plots are given by the equation 1/C2 = 2(E − Efb − kt/e)/εε0eNd,33 where C is the interfacial capacitance, E is the applied bias, k is the Boltzmann constant, t is the absolute temperature, e is the electronic charge, ε is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor and ε0 is the permittivity of free space. The equation can be used to calculate the donor density (Nd) from Efb and the value of the slope. Based on this equation, the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode shows a lower slope and more negative Efb compared with those of the pristine TiO2 photoelectrode, which indicates an increase in donor density in the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode. N-Doping could enhance the Ti3+ states, which is regarded as a type of donor-type impurity in TiO2.34–36 In addition, the deposition of oxides on the surface of TiO2 could passivate the trap states to prevent them from acting as the charge trap centers.33 For these two reasons, the carrier concentration increased and thus, the conductivity of the electrode improved.

It is interesting to note that the flat band potential (Efb) of the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode shifted to a more negative potential at −0.79 V vs. SCE compared with the Efb of pristine TiO2 at −0.58 V vs. SCE. This was probably caused by the deposition of oxides on the surface of TiO2.35 The negative shift of Efb facilitates efficient charge carrier separation by increasing the degree of band bending, thus accelerating the migration of electrons and holes in different directions at the interface.37 The Mott–Schottky plots of the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode exhibit another Efb at −1.1 V vs. SCE. This could be related to the different surface states from the deposited In2O3 and NiO or the N and Ti3+ co-doped on the surface of TiO2.38–40
Charge transfer properties of the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode and pristine TiO2 photoelectrode under illumination were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. EIS measurements were performed at a bias of 0.6 V vs. SCE from 0.1 Hz to 105 Hz under AM 1.5G illumination. Fig. 8b displays the Nyquist plots of the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode and pristine TiO2 photoelectrode. Both the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode and pristine TiO2 photoelectrode show a single capacitive arc. The diameters of the two arcs are related to the charge transfer resistance during the charge transfer process.41 The InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode exhibits an arc with smaller diameter than that of the pristine TiO2 photoelectrode under irradiation, suggesting that the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode is more efficient in transfer and separation of photogenerated charges.
According to the energy level distribution of TiO2, In2O3 and NiO, the proposed interface energies of InNi/N/TiO2 are illustrated in Fig. 9. As illustrated in Fig. 9a, the work functions of TiO2, In2O3 and NiO are about 4.2 eV,42,43 4.4 eV (ref. 44) and 5.3 eV,45 respectively, according to previous literature. On the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode, as shown in Fig. 9b, the energy bands of rutile TiO2 bend upward and In2O3 bend downward on the interface of TiO2 and In2O3. The energy bands of In2O3 bend upward and those of NiO bend downward on the In2O3 and NiO interface (Fig. 9b). As a result of band bending, the transfer of photoinduced electrons from TiO2 to In2O3 and NiO is difficult because of the potential barrier between the interfaces of both TiO2 and In2O3 and In2O3 and NiO. The photoinduced electrons have a strong tendency to transfer from TiO2 to Ti foil, and then to the counter electrode. In addition, band bending could favor the transfer of photoinduced holes from TiO2 to In2O3 and NiO. The abovementioned analysis suggests that the suitable choice of metal oxide components could improve the photoelectrochemical properties of TiO2 photoelectrodes by constructing interfaces that are favorable for the transfer and separation of photo-induced carriers. This inference is supported well by the experimental results.

To understand the role of Ti3+-doped TiO2 substrate and the impact of adding different chemical species to the synthesis solution, we conducted control synthesis experiments by using a variety of substrates and chemical species for the solvothermal synthesis. As shown in Fig. 10a, if the rutile TiO2 without Ti3+ substrate was used, after surface modification (called as InNi/R-TiO2), the performance of the photoelectrode (InNi/R-TiO2) was twice as high as that of the photoelectrode without surface modification (R-TiO2). This indicates that this modification strategy can be applied to other types of TiO2 photoelectrodes. The photocurrent of the InNi/R-TiO2 photoelectrode is 0.6 mA cm−2, which is much lower than that of the InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrode (1.29 mA cm−2). If Ti foil is used as the substrate, the photocurrent of the photoelectrode is about 250 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. 10b. This result indicates that the Ti3+-doped TiO2 substrate is crucial for enhancing the photoelectrochemical activities. Using only In and Ni salts in the synthesis (Metal/TiO2) without organic ligands or using only ligands (Ligand/TiO2) without metal precursors in the synthesis solution, the obtained photoelectrodes showed reduced photocurrents, as shown in Fig. 10c and d. This could be because the individual organic ligands or metal precursors are unable to form the atomically organized crystalline MOF on the surface of TiO2. Without MOF precursors, the N doping and In2O3 and NiO modifications cannot form on the surface of the TiO2 electrode in one step. The results show the important role that InNi-MOF plays in the improvement of the photoelectrochemical activities.

Moreover, we investigated the effects of synthesis time and temperatures of the heat treatment on the performance of the obtained photoelectrodes. With longer hydrothermal synthesis times, such as 12 h, the crystals of the InNi-MOF grew into large rods with size in micrometers on the surface of TiO2, as shown in Fig. S2a.† After heat treatment at 600 °C, the morphology of the rods is retained, as shown in the Fig. S2b and c.† The photoelectrochemical reactivity of the sample treated for 12 h is much lower than that of samples treated for 6 h (Fig. S3†). This could be because the longer synthesis time resulted in large sized In2O3 and NiO, which is disadvantageous for the homogeneous distribution of metal oxides on the surface of TiO2. A suitable size for the metal oxides, which is controlled by the growth conditions of the MOF precursor, is a key factor for the improved activity of the photoelectrode. Fig. S4† shows the photocurrent tested from InNi/N/TiO2 photoelectrodes annealed at different temperatures (400 °C, 500 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C), demonstrating that 600 °C is the optimal temperature for the heat treatment.
Experimental
Synthesis of TiO2 photoelectrode
The TiO2 photoelectrode was synthesized based on a previous study.6 A 1 × 2 cm Ti foil (0.25 mm thickness, 99.5% trace metal, Alfa Aesar) was cleaned by sonication in ethanol, acetone, isopropanol and deionized water, separately. Then, the clean Ti foil was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which contained 10 mL aqueous HCl (0.45 M), and treated at 220 °C for 12 h. After the reaction, the product was collected and washed with deionized water several times. A blue film grew on the surface of the Ti foil. The TiO2 photoelectrode prepared from the above procedures was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave containing 10 mL aqueous N2H4 solution (20% by weight). The autoclave was heated at 220 °C for 20 h. Then, the product was collected and washed with deionized water several times.
Synthesis of modified TiO2 photoelectrodes
Initially, 33.4 mg indium chloride (InCl3), 24.4 mg nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O), 26 mg terephthalic acid (C8H6O4) and 10 mg 1,2,4-triazole (C2H3N3) were added to a 20 mL glass vial containing a mixed solvent of 4 g N,N-dimethylmethanamide (C3H7NO) and 0.8 g deionized water. After stirring for 30 min, the TiO2 photoelectrode was immersed in the solution and left undisturbed for 30 min. Then, the vial was sealed and treated at 120 °C for 6 h. After reaction, the TiO2 electrode was collected and washed with deionized water and ethanol several times. Then, the samples were dried by Ar flow. At last, the photoelectrode was treated in a furnace at 600 °C with N2 flow for 2 h.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a Bruker D8 powder diffractometer using Cu Kα irradiation. Morphologies and structures of the as-prepared samples were further examined using a Philips Nova NanoSEM450 scanning electron microscope (SEM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained with a JEM 2010F field emission gun transmission electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Chemical compositions and states of the TiO2 samples were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Escalab 250Xi, a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source). All binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak (284.8 eV) arising from adventitious carbon. The optical absorbance spectra of the samples were recorded in a Shimadzu UV-3101PC UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer.
Photoelectrochemical measurement
Photoelectrochemical performance was investigated using Solartron 1287 Electrochemical Workstation in a standard three-electrode cell with the TiO2-based working electrode, Pt foil counter electrode, and saturated calomel reference electrode. The light source was a 150 W Xenon lamp (Newport, 69907) coupled with an AM 1.5G filter (Newport, 81094). Light intensity was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 with a radiant power meter (Newport, 70260) combined with a probe (Newport, 70268). Furthermore, 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6.3) purged with Ar was used as the electrolyte. In addition, a Xenon lamp with a filter (Newport, FR-GG400) was used to produce a visible light source below the wavelength of 400 nm. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was measured under the same xenon lamp equipped with a monochromator (Newport, 74404).
Conclusions
The conclusion, we developed a simple, one pot synthesis method that combines heteroatom doping strategy with surface modification of metal oxides to a TiO2 photoelectrode. The In2O3- and NiO-modified rutile TiO2 electrode with co-doped N and Ti3+ was obtained in this study. The co-doping of N and Ti3+ to TiO2 extended the absorption edge, enhanced the light absorption of TiO2 in the visible region and increased the donor density. At the same time, the surface modification by In2O3 and NiO also passivated the surface trap states and constructed the appropriate interfaces for promoting the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges. Subsequently, the modified TiO2 photoelectrode showed superior photoelectrochemical performance under both simulated sunlight (2.7 times) and visible light (nearly 2-fold) illumination compared with those of the pristine TiO2 photoelectrode. Suitable substrate of the electrode, appropriate size of the MOF precursor, and choice of ligands with metal ions play important roles in improving the performance of the materials. The modification method shown herein could potentially serve as a new promising route for the fabrication of high-performance PEC devices for TiO2 as well as other types of semiconductors.
