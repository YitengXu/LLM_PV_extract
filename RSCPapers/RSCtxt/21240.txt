    , Accepted 23rd September 2015First published on 23rd September 2015AbstractA low temperature molten salt process is developed to prepare crystalline Si nanoparticles through the reduction of micro-sized high silicon zeolite by metallic Al (or Mg) in molten AlCl3. The reaction can be initiated at 200 °C, and the yield is about 40%. As the reaction temperature increases to 250 °C, the yield can reach about 75%. When the prepared Si was used as an anode for Li-ion batteries, reversible capacities of 2663 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 50 cycles and 870 mA h g−1 at 3 A g−1 after 1000 cycles can be obtained. Similarly, this synthetic strategy is employed to synthesize Si nanoparticles starting from various abundant raw materials including SiO2 powder, kieselguhr, fiberglass, and even the natural mineral of albite.

Broader context
Silicon is well accepted as a promising high-capacity anode for the next-generation of rechargeable Li-ion batteries. After decades of development, various synthetic routes were established to produce Si. As the abundant raw materials, silicon oxides such as silica and silicates were generally utilized to prepare Si based materials via high-temperature thermal reduction processes, such as carbothermic reduction of silica at 1700 °C and aluminothermic/magnesiothermic reactions at above 650 °C. However, further lowering the converting temperature remains a big challenge. Herein, a low temperature molten salt process is developed, and the reduction of micro-sized high silicon zeolite into crystalline Si nanoparticles with metallic Al or Mg in molten AlCl3 is realized even at 200 °C, and the AlCl3 could be recycled for further use. Similarly, this synthetic strategy is applicable to synthesize Si nanoparticles starting from various abundant raw materials including SiO2 powder, kieselguhr, fiberglass, and even the natural mineral of albite. As anode materials for rechargeable Li-ion batteries, the as-prepared Si nanoparticles display outstanding electrochemical performance such as high reversible capacity, long-term cycling stability, and good rate capacity.

Silicon (Si)-based materials have attracted enormous attention due to their important applications in many fields, such as solar energy conversion, electronic devices, and high capacity anodes (with a theoretical capacity of 3579 mA h g−1 for Li3.5Si) for the rechargeable Li-ion batteries (LIBs).1–3
After decades of development, various synthetic routes were established to produce Si. Usually, silicon oxides such as silica and silicates were widely utilized to prepare Si materials via high-temperature reduction processes. For example, carbothermic reduction of silica was carried out at 1700 °C for the production of industrial Si.4 Subsequently, reduction of silica with metallic Al was realized at 700 °C, but this reaction is generally hindered by the by-product of Al2O3.5 In 2007, Sandhage et al. reported the reduction of silica with Mg into Si at 650 °C.6 To date, further lowering the reduction temperature is certainly desirable.
As an anode material for LIBs, micro-sized Si suffers from fast capacity fading due to its drastic volume variations (>270%) during repeated Li ion insertions and extractions. To address these issues, nano-sized Si could be used to effectively release the strain/stress caused by volume change, which enables it to suppress the pulverization of the active materials, thus improving the electrochemical performance.7 Up to now, magnesiothermic reduction of the relative silica precursor has been normally employed to fabricate the nanostructured Si anode as given in previous reports.8–11 For instance, macro-porous Si obtained from commercial SiO2 delivered a capacity of 1163 mA h g−1 at 0.8 A g−1 after 100 cycles.11
In the past decade, molten salts were also exploited as attractive liquid reaction media for the reduction of SiO2. For example, in 2003, electrochemical reduction of SiO2 into Si was realized in molten CaCl2 at 850 °C or in LiCl–KCl–CaCl2 at 500 °C.12 In the molten LiCl/KCl salts, the magnesiothermic reduction can be conducted at 550 °C;13 however, the yield was only 10%. Very recently, we reported the reduction of liquid SiCl4 into Si nano-crystals at 200 °C with Mg in molten AlCl3 with low melting point (∼190 °C).14
In this study, we develop a molten salt system for low-temperature reduction of silicon oxides to prepare nano-sized Si materials. Crystalline Si nano-particles are prepared through the aluminothermic reduction of micro-sized high silica zeolite (Si/Al = 11) in molten AlCl3. The reaction can be initiated at 200 °C, and the yield of Si can be increased from 40% at 200 °C to 75% at 250 °C. The related experiment suggests that the chemical reaction can be expressed as: 4Al + 3SiO2 + 2AlCl3 →3Si + 6AlOCl. It means that the molten AlCl3, traditionally used as a liquid medium, can also take part in reduction by forming AlOCl, which can easily be treated with diluted HCl. As anode materials for LIBs, the as-prepared Si nanoparticles deliver reversible capacities of 2663 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 50 cycles and 870 mA h g−1 at 3 A g−1 after 1000 cycles, and good rate performance. Furthermore, this methodology is demonstrated with magnesiothermic reduction at 200 °C, 2Mg + SiO2 + 6AlCl3 → 2MgAl2Cl8 + 2AlOCl + Si. It is noteworthy that this synthetic route is also applicable for reducing SiO2 powder and other silicates such as fiber glass and even the natural mineral of the bulk kieselguhr and albite into nano-sized Si particles.
Since AlCl3 is very sensitive to water, the reactions were conducted in a stainless steel autoclave to isolate air. As shown in the schematic illustration (Fig. 1a), AlCl3 (8.00 g), aluminium (Al) powder (0.8 g), and high silica zeolite rods (1.0 g; Si/Al = 11) were mixed and loaded in an autoclave (volume 20 mL). The high silica zeolite consists of well-crystallized micro-sized rods (Fig. S1, ESI†). Then, the autoclave was sealed immediately and heated in an electric stove. After cooling to room temperature and the subsequent washing treatment, the final sample is obtained (ESI†). The parallel experiments (Fig. S2, ESI†) indicate that the reaction can be initiated at 200 °C, and the yield of Si can be increased from 40% at 200 °C to 75% at 250 °C. Here we will take the product obtained at 250 °C as an example.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustration of the reduction procedure in an stainless steel autoclave. (b) XRD patterns and (c) Raman spectrum of the prepared Si sample. 

Fig. 1b shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared sample starting from high silica zeolite at 250 °C. All the five peaks located at 28.56, 47.44, 56.25, 69.3, and 76.51° can be indexed to the diffraction peaks of the 111, 220, 311, 400 and 331 lattice planes of the cubic Si (JCPDS No. 27-1402). According to Sherrer's equation, the average size of the particles is calculated to be about 10 nm. The Raman spectrum of the samples in Fig. 1c shows a clear peak at around 510 cm−1, corresponding to the first-order Raman scattering from the optic phonons of the Si–Si stretching motions of Si. The shift from 520 cm−1 for the bulk Si to 510 cm−1 may be due to the small size of the prepared Si particle.15 Furthermore, the broad weak peak located at around 955 cm−1 is assigned to the overtones of TO (L).16
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) picture (Fig. 2a) shows that the sample possesses a large amount of nanoparticles with a size ranging from tens to hundreds of nano-meters. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 2b) shows that these nanoparticles are composed of smaller aggregated crystalline nano-clusters and some denser particles. It is clear that both the size and shape are different from the micro-sized rod-like precursors (Fig. S1, ESI†), which may be attributed to the liquid phase reduction procedure in the molten salt. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2c) shows that the interplanar spacing of the crystal is about 1.9 Å, corresponding to the 220 planes of the crystalline Si. The lattice fringes can reach up to the end of the particle, implying fine crystallization. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum was recorded to investigate the surface contents of the Si nano-particles, as shown in Fig. 2d. A strong peak at about 100 eV is attributed to the Si.14 A weak peak at 103.5 eV assigned to Si4+ suggests the presence of small amount of amorphous SiO2, which is generally formed during the exposure of Si to air.17

To understand the molten-salt reduction process at such a low temperature, a series of experimental analyses were conducted. Fig. 3a shows the XRD pattern of the crude product obtained at 250 °C without any washing treatment. Only a weak diffraction peak at around 28.5° corresponding to Si is detected. The possible reason is that large amounts of salt and by-product in the system are mixed with the Si nanoparticles, and thus only the strongest diffraction peak can be observed. The presence of AlCl3 (labelled as “★”, JCPDS No. 77-0819) and metallic Al (labelled as “⋄”, JCPDS No. 01-1176) is attributed to the excess reagents. The peaks (labelled as “☆”) are assigned to the important by-products of AlOCl (JCPDS No. 16-0448), and the peaks at 10.75, 26.58, 32.59, and 36.55° are indexed to its 010, 111, 200, and 002 diffraction. Therefore, it is reasonable to propose that the reaction in the molten salt system is as follows: 4Al + 3SiO2 + 2AlCl3 →3Si + 6AlOCl. Both metallic Al and AlCl3 participated in the reduction process.

Based on the calculation of the free energy, the proposed equation is thermodynamically spontaneous and highly exothermic (ΔrGm = −880 kJ mol−1, ΔrHm = −906.68 kJ mol−1). The temperature change inside the stainless steel autoclave during the reaction is measured when the reaction temperature is set at the ignition temperature of 200 °C, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). As the furnace temperature increases up to 200 °C steadily, the inside temperature becomes 200 °C slowly and remains within a temperature range from 198 to 203 °C. The relatively stable temperature of the reaction system without significant fluctuation may be attributed to the high specific heat capacity of the employed excess salt, even though tremendous heat is generated during the reaction process. This molten salt system is different from the conventional thermit reaction associated with drastic temperature variations, therefore facilitating the growth of well crystallized Si nanoparticles.
In order to observe the reaction directly, we also carried out the experiments in a sealed quartz tube at 250 °C. Fig. 3b displays the photographs of the system at different reaction stages. One can see that before heating, the solid-state reactants are mixed uniformly. At 250 °C, the reaction system turns into liquid phase due to the molten AlCl3 (M. P. 190 °C), with some solid reactants at the bottom. After cooling to room temperature gradually, some crystal-like matter is condensed at the top of the tube, which is verified as pure AlCl3 by XRD (Fig. S4, ESI†). This AlCl3 could be taken out and recycled for further use. At the bottom, the solid product is obtained, which is the crude product containing crystalline Si.
From above, we can explain the reduction process in molten salts. The direct aluminothermic reduction of silica could be initiated over 700 °C that is above the melting point of metallic Al of 660 °C, because the generated harsh passivation layer of Al2O3 hinders the reaction severely.5 Besides, previous reports showed that AlCl3 could disintegrate and react with Al2O3 to generate AlOCl.18 So AlCl3 plays a key role in promoting the aluminothermic reduction at such a low temperature due to the following advantageous factors. First, at the reaction temperature (>200 °C), AlCl3 would melt as a liquid phase which acted as a reaction medium, ensuring that the reactants contact with each other tightly. Second, it has been determined that the AlCl3 could take part in the reaction. The oxygen in the silicon oxides can be removed by forming AlOCl, avoiding stable Al2O3 passivation layer, which is helpful for promoting the continuing reaction. Importantly, AlOCl can easily be treated with HCl. Third, previous reports demonstrated that during the reduction of silica with metallic Mg in LiCl/KCl, an ionization process existed in this system that produces ions and solvated electrons with a strong reducing power. In molten AlCl3, the similar ionization procedure may exist, Al = Al3+ + 3e, which would produce a large amount of highly active electrons, favoring the reaction progress at a low temperature.
As promising anode materials, the Si nanoparticles prepared through reducing silicate with Al at 250 °C are studied by coin-type half cells. Fig. 4a shows the voltage–capacity profiles of the Si anodes. During the first discharge process, the main potential plateau is located at around 0.1 V (vs. Li+/Li) that agrees well with the lithiation process of crystallized Si.19 In the second cycle, the discharge plateau moves to a higher potential at around 0.2 V, which is accepted as the phase of Si changes from crystalline to amorphous during the first cycle.20 On the other hand, the first and second charge potentials are at around 0.45 V, which is consistent with previous reports.21 The initial discharge/charge capacity of Si is 3826.7/3127.3 mA h g−1, corresponding to the initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 81.7%. In general, the capacity loss is possibly attributed to the inevitable formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) membrane from the decomposition of the electrolyte and the irreversible reaction between Li+ and active materials, both of which consume a number of Li+ ions.

The discharge/charge cycling behavior of Si nanoparticles is first studied with a current density of 0.5 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 4b. The electrode displays a discharge capacity of 2663 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. It should be noticed that the capacity exhibits an obvious degradation within the first two cycles caused by the formation of the stable SEI layer. Apart from the relatively low initial value, from second cycle onwards, the CE rapidly increases up to about 99% and remains stable.
Next, the rate capability of the Si nanoparticles is investigated with the current density ranging from 0.5 to 20 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 4c, the Si anode delivers the reversible capacities of 2960, 2909, 2760, 2613, 2406, 2230, 1980, 1750, and 1613 mA h g−1 at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 10, 15, and 20 A g−1, respectively. Note that the specific capacity remains 1613 mA h g−1 even at 20 A g−1. Importantly, after cycling at a high rate, a stable capacity of 2532 mA h g−1 could still be restored as the current density is returned back to 0.5 A g−1. Even at high current density, the corresponding CE is always over 98%, which exactly meets the demand for electric vehicles or hybrid electric vehicles. The long-term cycling stability at high current density was also elucidated (Fig. 4d). It must be mentioned that the cells are tested at a relative low current density of 0.3 A g−1 for first two cycles to activate the anode sufficiently. The Si electrode delivers a specific capacity of 870 mA h g−1 at 3 A g−1 after 1000 cycles. From 150th cycle onwards, no obvious capacity decay is detected. It is noteworthy that the charge/discharge plateaus at 500th and 1000th cycles are kept well (Fig. S5, ESI†).
The change in the morphology of the electrode before and after cycling was also investigated, as shown in Fig. S6 and S7 (ESI†). The as-prepared Si electrode maintains integrity and flat, and contacts with the current collector tightly. In contrast, the commercial micro-sized Si containing electrode generates some big protuberance and micro-sized holes on the electrode surface, which may be caused by a huge volume change. Overall, the outstanding electrochemical performance of the prepared crystalline Si nanoparticles may have been resulted because of the following advantageous aspects. On the one hand, the well-crystallized Si nanoparticles could alleviate the large strain/stress caused by the repeated lithium ion insertion/extraction from the electrode, thus keeping the structural integrity. On the other hand, the nanostructured Si is beneficial for the contact of electrolyte with the active material, shortening the transport/diffusion path of electrons/lithium ions.22
Furthermore, the proposed low temperature molten salt system is also demonstrated with metallic Mg. In molten AlCl3, the temperature of the magnesiothermic reduction reaction of high silica zeolite can be lowered from 650 °C to as low as 200 °C, and crystallized Si nanoparticles are obtained, as shown in Fig. 5a and b. In the reduction process, it is confirmed that both Mg and AlCl3 can participate in the reaction by forming by-products of AlOCl associated with MgAl2Cl8, 2Mg + SiO2 + 6AlCl3 → 2MgAl2Cl8 + 2AlOCl + Si, (Fig. S8, ESI†). This further proves the significant effect of AlCl3 on these metal reduction reactions. Furthermore, this method can also be extended to reduce various cheap and abundant raw materials, as shown in Fig. 5c–g. SiO2, artificial fiberglass and even the natural mineral of kieselguhr and albite could also be converted into crystalline Si nanoparticles via the proposed molten salt system, which offers a low-cost method for mass-production of Si. Fig. S9–S12 (ESI†) shows the corresponding XRD patterns.

Conclusions
In summary, we design a low temperature molten salt system for metallothermic reduction of silica and silicates, which could remarkably lower the direct reaction temperature for high-efficiency production of Si. It has been demonstrated that crystalline Si nanoparticles could be prepared by the reduction of micro-sized high silica zeolite with metallic Al in molten AlCl3 at a temperature as low as 200 °C. As the reaction temperature increases to 250 °C, the yield can reach up to about 75%. Compared with the previously reported molten salt, AlCl3 could not only provide liquid environment, but also participate in the reaction, which is significant to lower the reaction temperature. Interestingly, the utilized AlCl3 can be recycled by a special instrument for further use. As anode materials for LIBs, the Si nanoparticles display outstanding long-term cycling stability with high reversible capacity. Furthermore, this molten salt methodology is demonstrated with Mg at as low as 200 °C. Importantly, this proposed low temperature molten salt process is also applicable for the reduction of various abundant raw materials for producing nano-sized Si materials.

Broader context
Silicon is well accepted as a promising high-capacity anode for the next-generation of rechargeable Li-ion batteries. After decades of development, various synthetic routes were established to produce Si. As the abundant raw materials, silicon oxides such as silica and silicates were generally utilized to prepare Si based materials via high-temperature thermal reduction processes, such as carbothermic reduction of silica at 1700 °C and aluminothermic/magnesiothermic reactions at above 650 °C. However, further lowering the converting temperature remains a big challenge. Herein, a low temperature molten salt process is developed, and the reduction of micro-sized high silicon zeolite into crystalline Si nanoparticles with metallic Al or Mg in molten AlCl3 is realized even at 200 °C, and the AlCl3 could be recycled for further use. Similarly, this synthetic strategy is applicable to synthesize Si nanoparticles starting from various abundant raw materials including SiO2 powder, kieselguhr, fiberglass, and even the natural mineral of albite. As anode materials for rechargeable Li-ion batteries, the as-prepared Si nanoparticles display outstanding electrochemical performance such as high reversible capacity, long-term cycling stability, and good rate capacity.
