    , Accepted 12th April 2018First published on 12th April 2018AbstractHerein, p- and n-type switchable Cu–In–S microcrystals with a grooved pyramid-like morphology are facilely synthesized by transforming binary In2S3. A cation exchange and in situ growth mechanism is proposed to illustrate the generation of grooved pyramid-like Cu–In–S samples. It is demonstrated that the structure, composition, and semiconducting properties of Cu–In–S films could be controlled by maneuvering the rate of cation exchange, which can be simply adjusted by varying the amount of the sulfur precursor. With an increased amount of added thiourea, p-type CuInS2 and n-type CuIn5S8 as well as a mixture of CuInS2 and CuIn5S8 are prepared. The p-type CuInS2 and n-type CuIn5S8 photoelectrodes respectively exhibit a cathodic photocurrent of −0.18 mA cm−2 at −0.4 V vs. RHE and an anodic photocurrent of 0.61 mA cm−2 at 0.7 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution (pH = 3) under AM 1.5G illumination. More importantly, an unassisted water splitting system in parallel mode composed of a CoOx/CuIn5S8 photoanode and a Pt/CuInS2 photocathode is constructed, which shows a photocurrent density of 0.015 mA cm−2. The present work could provide a new idea for constructing efficient unassisted photoelectrochemical water splitting devices using copper-based chalcogenides. Meanwhile, the capability to switch p–n semiconducting properties provides a great inspiration to enable the development of novel semiconductor materials for photoelectric applications.
Introduction
Chalcogenide semiconductors of the I–III–VI2 family have gained great attention for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting1–4 and photovoltaic (PV) applications,5–8 owing to their prominent advantages of a high optical absorption coefficient, relatively high carrier mobility, and good stability under solar radiation.9–11 Usually, I–III2n+1–VI3n+2 is the general formula of I–III–VI2 family compounds, while I–III–VI2 and I–III5–VI8 are two typical ones. Among them, ternary Cu–In–S compounds like CuInS2 and CuIn5S8 without toxic Se have been extensively studied.12–14 For instance, CuInS2 has an optimum band gap value of 1.5 eV,15 which matches well with the solar spectrum. Hence, Cu–In–S semiconductors are promising materials for PEC water splitting. Many groups have made some progress in this research area, and they usually used CuInS2 as the photocathode for hydrogen generation and Pt as the counter electrode for oxygen generation with the assistance of an external bias.16–19
CuInS2 can exhibit n-type and p-type semiconductor properties hinging on the Cu/In ratio.20 Yet, most reported CuInS2 samples possess p-type conduction properties, because p-type CuInS2 is easier to grow compared with n-type CuInS2. This explains why CuInS2 is generally used as a photocathode. In-rich CuIn5S8, as another representative phase, is an n-type direct-gap semiconductor and has a similar band gap value to CuInS2.20 It seems very interesting to achieve unassisted PEC water splitting using CuInS2 as the photocathode and CuIn5S8 as the photoanode without adding an external bias. Although controlling the p-type and n-type conductivity of semiconductors has always been an area of concern, controlling it without doped extraneous elements remains a big challenge. There are several ways to control the p-type and n-type behaviors of Cu-based semiconductors according to the previous literature. Jiang and co-workers reported that the semiconductor type of Cu2O prepared by electrodeposition strongly depended on the pH values of the electrolyte. Namely, p-Cu2O films were formed in basic solution and n-Cu2O films were deposited in acidic solution.21 Mallouk and co-workers found that p- and n-type CuInSe2 nanowire arrays were fabricated by electrodeposition with varied potentials.22 If we can find a suitable approach to prepare switchable p-type and n-type Cu–In–S films, the concept of forming a tandem PEC cell for unassisted water splitting can be realized.
So far, many methods have been developed for fabricating Cu–In–S films. Conventional planar Cu–In–S films were prepared by sulfurization of electrodeposited Cu and In metallic precursor films.23,24 Another common method was to first fabricate Cu–In–S nanocrystals (such as nanoplates25 and nanorods26) by the colloidal solution approach and then deposit these nanocrystals on a substrate via a drop-casting or spin-coating method. However, it is hard to restrain various side reactions caused by the multiple precursors required in the direct, solution-based fabrication of ternary and quaternary nanomaterials.27,28 Postsynthetic transformation of binary nanomaterials has evolved as an efficient method for the preparation of ternary and quaternary nanomaterials with a controlled morphology or composition.29–31 The cation exchange (CE) reaction in solution has been progressively investigated as a prime strategy for postsynthetic transformation of nanomaterials because it provides a predictable tool to design crystalline nanostructures.32,33 Typically, binary nanomaterials are first synthesized, and act as a template for the synthesis of target ternary and quaternary nanomaterials by cation exchange. Through this process, new multinary compounds with varied compositions and crystal phases can be produced. Min and co-workers showed a CE transformation from trigonal In2Se3 nanoparticles to tetragonal CuInSe2 nanocrystals in ethylene glycol.34 Chen and co-workers reported the fabrication of CuInS2 nanocrystals through diffusion of Cu+ ions into In2S3 nanoplates, which could control the chemical composition by varying the amount of Cu+ ions in the reaction mixture.35 However, reports about the direct transformation of binary chalcogenide films into ternary chalcogenide films on a substrate using CE reactions are scarce.
Herein, Cu–In–S films were fabricated via a simple solution-based method. Instead of directly fabricating Cu–In–S nanocrystals, we first hydrothermally prepared In2S3 pyramid-like films as a precursor, and then solvothermally transformed them into Cu–In–S films. A cation exchange and in situ growth mechanism is proposed to illustrate the formation of grooved pyramid Cu–In–S microcrystals. By maneuvering the rate of cation exchange, p-type CuInS2 and n-type CuIn5S8 microcrystals could be systematically prepared. To examine the photoelectrochemical application for solar energy utilization, a tandem cell composed of a CoOx/CuIn5S8 photoanode and a Pt/CuInS2 photocathode in parallel mode was finally constructed for unassisted PEC water splitting.
Experimental section
Synthesis
Indium nitrate hydrate (In(NO3)3·4.5H2O, 99.0%), thiourea (CH4N2S, 99.0%), copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 99.0%), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, 99.0%), ethylene glycol (C2H6O2, 99.5%), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98.0%), and chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O, 37.5% Pt basis) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All chemicals were used without extra purification.
In2S3 films were fabricated based on our previous report.36 In a typical synthesis, 5 mM of indium nitrate and 25 mM of thiourea were dissolved in 60 mL of ultrapure water under constant stirring for 30 min. The solution was then transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave with a FTO glass substrate (2 × 4 cm) placed against the vessel wall, which was heated to 140 °C and maintained for 24 h. The as-prepared films were taken out, and washed 3 times with deionized water and ethanol.
In2S3 films were transformed into Cu–In–S films by a solvothermal treatment with 15 mM of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and different molar concentrations of thiourea (0, 10, 15, 30, and 45 mM) in ethylene glycol solution at 200 °C for 12 h. More specifically, the In2S3 film was placed against the vessel wall of the Teflon-lined autoclave with the conducting side facing down. The autoclave was then put into an oven, heated at 200 °C for 12 h, and cooled down to room temperature naturally. Subsequently, the as-prepared films were moved into a tube furnace, which was heated to 400 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and maintained for 0.5 h in an Ar atmosphere. The corresponding samples were respectively denoted as Cu15S0, Cu15S10, Cu15S15, Cu15S30, and Cu15S45, depending on the molar concentrations of copper and sulfur precursors. For example, 15 mM of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and 15 mM of thiourea were added for preparing Cu15S15.
Pt was deposited on the Cu–In–S film as the cocatalyst by a photo-assisted electrochemical method. Typically, the Cu–In–S film was immersed into 100 mL of 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH adjusted to 3 by using H2SO4) with 1 mmol of H2PtCl6. The deposition lasted 5 min illuminated by using a 300 W xenon lamp at a potential of −0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl.
The CoOx layer was deposited using a plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (ALD) method. 50 ALD cycles of CoOx deposition were operated with each ALD cycle consisting of a 1 s dose of the cobaltocene precursor, a 50 s N2 purge, a 15 s pulse of oxygen plasma, and another 60 s N2 purge.
Characterization
The crystal structures were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) employing a PANalytical X'pert PRO diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). Laser Raman spectra were recorded on a Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR spectrometer using 514.5 nm radiation from an argon ion laser at 20 mW. The morphology and elemental analysis was performed by using a JEOL JSM-7800F scanning electron microscope (SEM) attached with an OXFORD INCA energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector and a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with an OXFORD MAX-80 EDX detector. The light absorption properties were measured using a Bruker VERTEX 70 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained by using a Kratos Axis-Ultra DLD instrument with a monochromatized Al Kα line source (150 W). All binding energies were calibrated to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV.
Photoelectrochemical measurement
All PEC measurements were conducted on a CHI760D workstation (CH Instruments). The as-prepared electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode, and a platinum foil were respectively used as the working, reference, and counter electrodes. 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution with different pH values (pH adjusted to 3 by using H2SO4, pH 6.3 for 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution, and pH adjusted to 10.5 by using NaOH) as electrolytes were used to test the PEC performance. The simulated light source was a 500 W xenon lamp equipped with an AM 1.5G filter. The distance between the Xe lamp and the reactor is 18 cm. The light intensity on the photoelectrodes is 100 mW cm−2. According to the Nernst equation, the potential vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) could be obtained from the measured potential vs. Ag/AgCl: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059pH + 0.197(1)where ERHE denotes the converted potential vs. RHE and EAg/AgCl denotes the measured potential vs. Ag/AgCl. The Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots were obtained in the range of −0.2 to 0.4 V (vs. RHE) at an AC frequency of 1000 Hz in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH adjusted to 3 by using H2SO4) under dark conditions.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a and S1† exhibit the wide and magnified XRD patterns of Cu–In–S films prepared with different amounts of thiourea during the solvothermal treatment. The XRD peaks of the Cu15S0 film without thiourea could be ascribed to the tetragonal Cu1.81S phase (JCPDS no. 41-0959), as revealed by three intense XRD peaks of (124), (135) and (019) planes appearing at 32.52°, 45.35° and 46.09°. The XRD peaks of the Cu15S10 film at 27.90°, 46.49°, and 55.10° corresponded to the (112), (220), and (132) planes of tetragonal CuInS2 (JCPDS no. 47-1372). For the Cu15S30 film, the peaks of CuInS2 disappeared, while three dominant peaks emerged at 27.67°, 33.52°, and 48.13° corresponding to the (311), (400), and (440) planes of cubic CuIn5S8 (JCPDS no. 72-0956). Notably, tetragonal CuInS2 and cubic CuIn5S8 both existed for Cu15S15 and Cu15S45 films. For all samples, there are no typical diffraction peaks corresponding to cubic In2S3 (Fig. S2†), which indicates that the In2S3 precursors were successfully converted.

Raman spectra were used to further confirm the transformation process of the crystal structures. As shown in Fig. 1b, a distinct peak at around 305 cm−1 was observed corresponding to the CuInS2 phase, and another peak at 345 cm−1 belonged to the CuIn5S8 phase.37,38 No other Raman peaks such as those of In2S3 (Fig. S3†) could be observed. The Cu15S10 film and Cu15S30 film exhibited pure CuInS2 and CuIn5S8, respectively. However, CuInS2 and CuIn5S8 phases simultaneously existed in the Cu15S15 film and Cu15S45 film. The Raman results were in accordance with the XRD measurements.
The atomic ratios of Cu:In:S for the Cu–In–S films were determined by EDX analysis. As shown in Table S1,† the Cu:In:S atomic ratio of the Cu15S10 film was close to 1:1:2, which satisfied the stoichiometric ratio of CuInS2. The measured atomic ratio of the Cu15S30 film, which was almost 1:5:8, was the same as the stoichiometric ratio of CuIn5S8. However, the measured atomic ratio was somewhere between 1:1:2 and 1:5:8 for Cu15S15 and Cu15S45 films, which strongly indicated that both Cu15S15 and Cu15S45 samples were the mixtures of CuInS2 and CuIn5S8. There was still In element in the Cu15S0 film from the EDX result, suggesting that a small amount of residual In remained. On the basis of XRD, Raman, and EDX results, it can be summarized that the crystal structure of Cu–In–S samples can be tuned by changing the amount of thiourea.
To investigate the morphology of the as-prepared samples, the corresponding top-view SEM images were obtained as shown in Fig. 2a–f. The average particle size of the original pyramid-like In2S3 microcrystals was around 1 μm and the external surface was rather smooth (Fig. 2a), which was consistent with our previous results.36 When the solvothermal transformation process was performed without adding thiourea, the surface of the as-prepared microcrystals (Fig. 2b) became rough. Many nanoparticles possibly corresponding to Cu1.81S with a size of 20–40 nm appeared on the surface of the pyramid-like architecture. When the solvothermal reaction was carried out with thiourea, all samples exhibited a grooved morphology along the edges of pyramid-like microcrystals. A close examination revealed that small thin and irregular nanosheets grew along the two edges of the grooves (Fig. 2c–f). The morphology change of Cu–In–S films with varied reaction time is shown in Fig. S4.† With the solvothermal reaction prolonging to 3 h, Cu15S10 microcrystals basically sustained the pyramid-like morphology, and shallow “V shape” grooves firstly appeared along every edge of the pyramids. As the reaction time extended to 12 h, thin and irregular nanosheets were subsequently generated along the two edges of these grooves, forming grooved pyramid-like Cu–In–S microcrystals.

To confirm the detailed compositions of the pyramid-like microcrystals, low and high resolution TEM images of the Cu15S10 film were obtained as shown in Fig. 2g and h. Lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.31 nm were clearly observed in the main part of micron-sized pyramids, corresponding to the (013) planes of tetragonal CuInS2. Interestingly, the HRTEM image of the nanosheets along the grooves also showed lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.31 nm, which revealed that these nanosheets were also the tetragonal CuInS2 phase. In addition, the elemental distributions of the Cu15S10 film were determined by EDX mapping analysis. As shown in Fig. 2i–l, the Cu, In, and S elements were evenly distributed throughout the pyramid, further proving the successful transformation of In2S3 into CuInS2.
In the present study, the In2S3 films were transformed into Cu–In–S films by a solvothermal treatment with Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and CS(NH2)2 in ethylene glycol (EG) solution. EG could act as the reducing agent and ligand during the reaction. Thiourea could play a triple role, being able to reduce copper(II) ions, coordinating with the copper ions, and supplying the source of sulfur. Cu2+ ions could be reduced to Cu+ ions by EG or thiourea. Cu+ ions could further go through a coordination to generate copper(I) complexes in solutions,39,40 as described in eqn (2). Herein, CS(NH2)2 was denoted as Tu. 9CS(NH2)2 + 4Cu+ + 4NO3− → [Cu4(Tu9)](NO3)4(2)Clearly, the facets of the pyramid-like In2S3 crystals are flat and smooth, which are well defended by ligand passivation, so the CE process is currently inhibited through these facets.41,42 However, thin edges are usually inclined to be ragged and defective, as well as relatively badly protected by ligands. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, CE through the thin edges is apparently easier to happen.33,43 When the CE reaction is initiated, the initial Cu+ and In3+ exchange velocities are not balanced, which resulted in forming “V shape” grooves along every edge of pyramid-like In2S3. During the CE process, when the outward diffusion rates are higher than inward diffusion rates, the parent nanocrystals would be dissolved.44,45 Herein, a relatively slow rate of Cu+ in-diffusion was acquired due to a low concentration of Cu+ in the environment at the initial stage limited by its release rate. As the reaction proceeded, the velocity of out-diffused In3+ and in-diffused Cu+ reached a balance, and the grooved pyramid-like morphology could be maintained. Then, the successful in situ growth of Cu–In–S nanosheets was achieved along these two edges, which came from the out-diffused In3+, as well as residual Cu+ and S2− in the solution, owing to higher surface free energy in the two edges of the “V shape” groove.

(c) Atomic model of cubic In2S3, cubic CuIn5S8, and tetragonal CuInS2 viewed along the [100] direction. The yellow spheres denote the sulfur atoms, the blue spheres denote the Cu atoms, and the black spheres denote the In atoms. 
To confirm the CE process, the composition of residual powders from the solution after the solvothermal reaction for preparing the Cu15S10 sample was examined by XPS measurements. As presented in Fig. S5,† In element was clearly present in the powders, which verified that In3+ ions were indeed out-diffused into the reaction solution. If the copper precursor was not included in the solvothermal reaction, the prepared samples maintained the original pyramid-like morphology without grooves along the edges (Fig. S6†), which illustrated that the CE process should be vital to the grooved morphology.
To further understand the origin of the unique grooved pyramid-like morphology, comparative experiments using different types of copper sources and solvents were carried out. The top-view SEM images of the Cu15S10 film prepared with copper acetate or copper chloride as the copper precursor are shown in Fig. 4a and b. No grooved pyramid-like morphology could be observed for these samples. The sample prepared with copper acetate basically sustained the same morphology as that of In2S3 crystals. However, the pyramid-like morphology completely disappeared, and a nanoplate morphology was generated for the Cu15S10 film prepared with copper chloride. As we discussed earlier, the formation of the grooved pyramid-like morphology was caused by a low concentration of Cu+ in the environment at the initial stage limited by its release rate. We speculate that the leaving-group ability of the anion ligands plays a vital role in determining the release rate of copper ions, in the sequence NO3− < Cl− < CH3COO−.42,46 Thus, the release rate correlates with the iconicity of the copper source, with the slowest release rate for Cu(NO3)2. Meanwhile, ethylenediamine was used to replace ethylene glycol as the solvent. The top-view SEM images of Cu15S10 and Cu15S30 films prepared with ethylenediamine are exhibited in Fig. 4c and d. It was found that defective pyramid-like microcrystals were fabricated. These differences in the morphology should mainly result from varied solvent coordination ability and reducing ability.47–50 All above experimental characterization confirmed that the formation of the unique grooved pyramid-like morphology should be attributed to the coupling effect of different precursors.

Although a similar grooved pyramid-like morphology has been achieved for all Cu–In–S samples prepared with copper nitrate, thiourea, and EG, their crystal structures and compositions are varied by maneuvering the rate of cation exchange depending on the added amount of thiourea (Fig. 3b). It is believed that the CE process could be conducted according to eqn (3) and (4): 2In2S3 + 3Cu+ → 3CuInS2 + In3+(3) 8In2S3 + 3Cu+ → 3CuIn5S8 + In3+(4)
As shown in Table S1,† as the amount of thiourea was increased from 0 to 30 mM, the content of In element gradually increased, and the content of Cu element continually decreased. This means that both the rates of Cu+ in-diffusion and In3+ out-diffusion gradually decreased. The corresponding XRD and Raman results demonstrated that the phase changed from tetragonal Cu1.81S to tetragonal CuInS2, and finally to cubic CuIn5S8. A possible explanation is that there was another competitive reaction to simultaneously deplete copper ions and sulfur ions. The XRD analysis of residual powders after the synthesis process confirmed that the products of the competitive reaction were Cu2S and Cu1.81S (Fig. S7†). When thiourea was added to the solution, it could first coordinate with Cu+ ions and NO3− ions to form [Cu4(Tu9)](NO3)4 complexes. According to eqn (2), the reaction needs 33.75 mM of thiourea to totally coordinate with 15 mM of Cu+ ions. When the molar concentration of thiourea was varied from 10 to 30 mM, a part of Cu+ ions would not coordinate with thiourea. The Cu2S and Cu1.81S by-products could be generated from the self-decomposition of [Cu4(Tu9)](NO3)4 complexes and the reaction between residual Cu+ ions in solution and the complexes. As the amount of thiourea increased, the competitive reaction would get faster. Accordingly, the CE reaction was greatly inhibited, giving rise to the formation of In-rich CuIn5S8 (Fig. 3b). However, further increasing the molar concentration of thiourea to 45 mM could break the reaction balance. All Cu+ ions would coordinate with thiourea to generate the complexes, and no residual copper ions in solution can participate in the reaction to form Cu2S and Cu1.81S. This means that the rate of the competitive reaction could decrease and the rate of the cation exchange reaction could increase, which resulted in the co-existence of CuInS2 and CuIn5S8. Therefore, the CE velocity could be easily controlled by the amount of thiourea.
Based on the above analysis, both pure cubic CuIn5S8 and tetragonal CuInS2 phases could be acquired via the CE reaction. To deeply understand the formation mechanism of these two phases, it is significantly meaningful to explore it at the atomic scale. As displayed in Fig. 3c, the initial In2S3 film has a cubic crystal structure. The basis of the cubic In2S3 is a compact cubic packing of S atoms; 70% of the indium atoms are statistically distributed over octahedral sites and 30% over tetrahedral sites.51 The period of the cubic lattice of In2S3 is α = 10.77 Å with ordered vacancies in this phase.42 When pyramid-like In2S3 was exposed to Cu+ ion solution, the latter can diffuse into the In2S3 lattice, either via an interstitial or via a vacancy-assisted mechanism.33,35 Depending on Cu+ ion diffusivity, the Cu+ can enter the whole In2S3 lattice. The in-diffusion of Cu+ ions that leads to the nucleation of the Cu–In–S phase occurs at the energetically favorable sites. During this step, In3+ ions were expelled from the In2S3 lattice through an out-diffusion mechanism and became solvated. When cubic In2S3 was transformed into cubic CuIn5S8, the crystal structure remained unchanged after the CE reaction, indicating that the Cu+ ions were only incorporated into the In-vacancy of the In2S3 lattice in this case. On the other hand, when it was transformed into tetragonal CuInS2, the Cu+ ions were diffused into the In2S3 lattice via an interstitial and a vacancy-assisted way, resulting in the distortion of the cubic phase and finally forming the tetragonal CuInS2 phase.
As shown in Fig. 5, all prepared Cu–In–S samples exhibited strong absorption over the whole visible light and near-infrared regions, indicating their good potential in photoelectrochemical application. The optical band gaps can be derived from the tangent line in the plot of (αhν)1/nversus hν,52 as shown in eqn (5): (αhν) = B(hν − Eg)n(5)where α is the optical absorption coefficient, B is a constant, h is the Plank constant, ν is the frequency, Eg is the energy gap and n is a constant which characterizes the electron transition process. The constant n takes the value of 0.5 for direct transition and 2 for indirect transition. Generally, according to the Tauc plot for optical transitions, the optical band gap value could be obtained by extrapolating the linear portion of the (αhν)1/nvs. hν plots. Herein, CuInS2 and CuIn5S8 are direct bandgap semiconductors and Cu1.81S is an indirect bandgap semiconductor. As shown in Fig. S8,† the optical band gaps of Cu15S0, Cu15S10, Cu15S15, Cu15S30, and Cu15S45 were found to be respectively 1.13, 1.43, 1.50, 1.54, and 1.54 eV, which were consistent with the reported values.20,53,54 Due to the different bandgaps of In2S3 and Cu–In–S samples, the as-prepared electrodes displayed varied colors (Fig. S9†).

The Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots of Cu–In–S films were examined to confirm their semiconductive behaviors. As observed in Fig. 6, Cu15S10 films showed a negative slope, which indicated the p-type behavior of the as-prepared CuInS2. The M–S plot of the Cu15S30 film presented a positive slope, which indicated that the CuIn5S8 sample is an n-type semiconductor with electrons as the majority carriers. Interestingly, the M–S plots of Cu15S15 and Cu15S45 films exhibited an inverted “V shape”, which demonstrated that these films were composed of both p- and n-type semiconductors.55–59 The result is in good agreement with XRD and Raman results.

In order to verify the promising applications of these ternary Cu–In–S films in solar utilization, the current–voltage response of the Cu–In–S films was tested in a PEC cell using 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution with different pH values under chopped light irradiation. There was no apparent photoresponse for the Cu15S0 film (Fig. S10†), possibly due to the large number of defects in Cu1.81S. As shown in Fig. 7a, the Cu15S10 film produced cathodic photocurrents, which indicated that the Cu15S10 film showed p-type semiconductor properties. When measured in acidic and basic aqueous solutions, the sample exhibited almost the same cathodic photocurrent density of −0.18 mA cm−2 at −0.4 V vs. RHE. However, a much lower photocurrent was generated in neutral aqueous solution. As displayed in Fig. 7c, the Cu15S30 film generated an anodic photocurrent, corresponding to n-type properties. Impressively, the Cu15S30 film exhibited a photocurrent density of 0.61 mA cm−2 at 0.7 V vs. RHE in acidic aqueous solution. This value was obviously higher than those measured in neutral and basic aqueous solutions. The CuIn5S8 film easily suffers from photodecomposition in the basic solution, which could result in poor PEC water oxidation performance.60,61 The Cu15S15 and Cu15S45 films exhibited both cathodic and anodic photocurrents, which further demonstrated that these films were composed of p-type CuInS2 and n-type CuIn5S8 (Fig. 7b and d). The Cu15S15 film exhibited an anodic photocurrent density similar to that of the Cu15S30 film but a lower cathodic photocurrent density compared with the Cu15S10 film. However, as for the Cu15S45 film, the cathodic photocurrent density was lower than that of the Cu15S10 film, and the anodic photocurrent density was lower than that of the Cu15S30 film.

The blue curves correspond to pH 10.5, the black curves correspond to pH 6.3, and the red curves correspond to pH 3. 
More profoundly, we constructed a tandem unassisted system in parallel mode composed of a CoOx/CuIn5S8 photoanode and a Pt/CuInS2 photocathode to further explore the solar water splitting properties of Cu–In–S films. As shown in Fig. S11 and S12,† loading Pt and CoOx catalysts can efficiently enhance the PEC properties. The maximum operating-point current density (JOP) of the CoOx/CuIn5S8–Pt/CuInS2 tandem PEC cell (no bias) calculated from the crossing point of the current–potential curves of the photoanode and photocathode was 0.019 mA cm−2 at 0.36 V vs. RHE (Fig. 8a). The current–time curve under AM 1.5G illumination for the CoOx/CuIn5S8–Pt/CuInS2 tandem PEC cell is shown in Fig. 8b. Interestingly, the PEC cell exhibited a stable photocurrent of 0.015 mA cm−2 without a noticeable decrease over 180 s. Moreover, the current–time curve of the CoOx/CuIn5S8–Pt/CuInS2 tandem PEC cell under chopped light is shown in Fig. S13.† The photocurrent density was almost the same as the value tested without chopped light irradiation. The tandem cell showed a transient current spike when turning on the simulated solar illumination because of capacitive charging effects.62,63 In the future, oxygen evolution reaction catalysts64 and hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts65–69 will be further optimized to accelerate the surface charge transfer to the electrolyte. Meanwhile, a heterojunction structure70–73 can be constructed to improve the bulk charge transport to boost the PEC performance.

Conclusions
In summary, p- and n-type switchable Cu–In–S grooved pyramid-like microcrystals have been synthesized by controllably transforming binary In2S3 films. A cation exchange and in situ growth mechanism is proposed to illustrate the formation of the grooved pyramid-like Cu–In–S microcrystals. It was proved that maneuvering the rate of cation exchange was critical to switching p-type tetragonal CuInS2 to n-type cubic CuIn5S8. The n-type CuIn5S8 photoanode and p-type CuInS2 photocathode respectively exhibited a photocurrent density of 0.61 mA cm−2 at 0.7 V vs. RHE and −0.18 mA cm−2 at −0.4 V vs. RHE. More profoundly, we fabricated an unassisted solar water splitting system in parallel mode based on a CoOx/CuIn5S8 photoanode and a Pt/CuInS2 photocathode, which demonstrated the versatile potential of tunable Cu–In–S compounds for solar energy conversion. Although the current PEC system exhibited limited efficiency and stability, the capability to switch p–n semiconducting properties in the present work provides a great inspiration to develop novel photoelectric devices.
