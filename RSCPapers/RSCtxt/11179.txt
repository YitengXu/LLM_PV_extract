    First published on 17th February 2015AbstractThe development of advanced energy storage devices is at the forefront of research geared towards a sustainable future. Nanostructured materials are advantageous in offering huge surface to volume ratios, favorable transport features, and attractive physicochemical properties. They have been extensively explored in various fields of energy storage and conversion. This review is focused largely on the recent progress in nanostructured Mo-based electrode materials including molybdenum oxides (MoOx, 2 ≤ x ≤ 3), dichalconides (MoX2, X = S, Se), and oxysalts for rechargeable lithium/sodium-ion batteries, Mg batteries, and supercapacitors. Mo-based compounds including MoO2, MoO3, MoO3−y (0 < y < 1), MMoxOy (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Ca, Mn, Zn, Mg, or Cd; x = 1, y = 4; x = 3, y = 8), MoS2, MoSe2, (MoO2)2P2O7, LiMoO2, Li2MoO3, etc. possess multiple valence states and exhibit rich chemistry. They are very attractive candidates for efficient electrochemical energy storage systems because of their unique physicochemical properties, such as conductivity, mechanical and thermal stability, and cyclability. In this review, we aim to provide a systematic summary of the synthesis, modification, and electrochemical performance of nanostructured Mo-based compounds, as well as their energy storage applications in lithium/sodium-ion batteries, Mg batteries, and pseudocapacitors.

1. Introduction
Nowadays the increasing environmental problems, such as global warming and pollution, give a great impetus to the reduction of the society's dependence on fossil fuels. It is preferable to produce energy from renewable and sustainable resources (e.g., solar and wind). The utilization of electricity generated from intermittent renewable sources requires efficient energy storage systems (ESSs). Among clean energy technologies, electrochemical ESSs are considered the most feasible, environmentally friendly, and sustainable.1–6 Electrochemical ESSs such as rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors have been widely used in portable electronics, electric vehicles, and smart electrical grids.7–12
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are rechargeable energy-storage devices based on Li-ion shuffling between a negative electrode (also termed anode) and a positive electrode (cathode). During discharge, Li ions carry the current from the anode to the cathode through the nonaqueous electrolyte and a separator diaphragm, and the process reverses in charging. Since commercialization by Sony in 1991, LIBs have become some of the most popular rechargeable batteries for portable electronics (e.g., laptops, cell phones, and digital cameras), because of high energy density, no memory effect, and only a slow loss of capacity when not in use. Meanwhile, the advent of LIBs has ushered in the wireless revolution, and further stimulated a quest to power electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The electrode materials are the key components of LIBs that play crucial roles in the overall performance.13–17 In order to power EVs or HEVs, five basic factors including energy density, power density, cost, life and safety need to be well balanced.
Dramatic developments in next-generation electrical transportation and large-scale ESSs for smart grids will require substantially greater amounts of materials to build large batteries. Li is not regarded as an abundant element. The mean mass fraction of Li in the earth's crust is estimated to be only 20 ppm. It is also witnessed that the price of the Li resource has been increasing in recent years, arising from more and more use of LIBs. In contrast, the abundance and low cost of Na in the earth will become advantageous when a large amount of materials are demanded for renewable energy solutions.18–23 Moreover, Na is the second-lightest and -smallest alkali metal next to Li. Therefore, the sacrifice in energy density is expected to be minimized if the same electrochemical insertion is utilized for discharge–charge cycling. Owing to the similarities in electrochemistry between Li and Na, the state-of-the-art advances in LIBs may pave the way for developing sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, Na ion intercalation and storage mechanisms are also scientifically challenging, since Na+ ions are ∼70% larger in radius than Li+ ions. It is highly desirable to explore suitable host materials to accommodate Na+ ions and facilitate reversible insertion–extraction of Na+ ions. In addition to Li, Mg is another abundant element in the earth's crust, leading to wider availability and much lower cost. Rechargeable Mg batteries are now gaining increasing interest especially after Aurbach's pioneering work.24 Fundamentally, the science and technology of rechargeable Mg batteries are quite different from those of LIBs and SIBs.25 The use of alkali metals such as Li and Na in rechargeable batteries is enabled by the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer on the surface of the electrodes via reaction with the electrolyte.26,27 The passive SEI film hampers the transport of electrons, but is still permeable to Li+ and Na+ ions. Compared to LIBs or SIBs, it is noted that the diffusion of alkaline earth metal cations like Mg2+ ions through interfacial passivation layers is much sluggish or even impossible. Meanwhile, Mg2+ ions have the divalent nature and Mg metal anodes are used in rechargeable Mg batteries. The divalent nature of Mg2+ ions enables a high theoretical specific capacity (2205 mA h g−1).28–30 In comparison to LIBs, however, the kinetically sluggish Mg intercalation–insertion and diffusion in cathode materials as well as the incompatibility between the Mg anode and the electrolyte due to the high polarizing ability of the divalent Mg2+ ions, are the major obstacles for Mg rechargeable batteries.31,32
Supercapacitors, also known as electrochemical capacitors or ultracapacitors, have attracted much attention because of their fast charging capabilities, long charge–discharge cycles, and broad operating temperature ranges.33 They can complement or even replace batteries in a wide variety of applications, including electric vehicles, electronics and smart grids, when high power delivery or uptake is needed.14,34–37 Generally, supercapacitors can be classified into two categories based on the charge storage mechanism. One is the electrical double layer capacitor (EDLC), where electrical energy is stored by ion adsorption and desorption. The other type of supercapacitor is the so-called pseudocapacitor, in which electrical energy is stored by fast and reversible Faradic reactions.35 The specific pseudo-capacitance often exceeds that of carbon materials used in EDLCs. The pseudo-capacitive behavior of the redox reactions is similar to the electrochemical reactions in rechargeable batteries. However, pseudo-capacitors often suffer from the drawbacks of a low power density (due to poor electrical conductivity), and a lack of stability during cycling. Moreover, hybrid capacitors with an asymmetrical electrode configuration, combining these two charge storage mechanisms (Faradaic and non-Faradaic), have recently aroused much interest. They offer an attractive alternative to conventional pseudo-capacitors or EDLCs by combining a battery-like electrode (energy source) with a capacitive-like electrode (power source) in the same cell, and the overall cell voltage, energy, and power density can be improved.38–48
Nanomaterials with attractive chemical and physical properties are being explored for their potential in energy storage applications. The design and creation of new materials and substances that are chemically modified from the molecular and atomic level to sizes on the nanoscale would offer significantly enhanced functions for energy storage applications. Meanwhile, the development of advanced nanocharacterization techniques has facilitated the fundamental molecular-level understanding on structure–performance relationships, which are strongly related to the grain size and size distribution, shape, chemical composition, interfaces, surface (potentially with different electrolytes), and interactions between the constituent domains. This knowledge, together with effective synthetic strategies, has inspired the design and fabrication of novel nanostructured materials for a wide variety of energy-based applications. During the past decades, much effort has been particularly devoted to fabricating a great number of nanostructured materials as electrodes in a range of LIBs, SIBs, Mg batteries, and supercapacitors. This research trend has been evidenced by many important pioneering studies published during the past decades.37,49–53 As expected, a notable improvement in performance has been achieved through recent advances in the development of advanced nanostructured materials and understanding on charge storage mechanisms.54 In batteries and supercapacitors, nanostructuring of electrode materials may reduce diffusion/transport lengths for both ions and electrons, increase active sites, and relieve the volume expansion–contraction, thus leading to improved capacity, and higher power/energy density, and a longer cycle life. In some cases, new thermodynamics and/or kinetics allow enhanced phase transitions and rate capability during Li+ intercalation–deintercalation. It is believed that new development in the field of nanomaterial chemistry holds the key to further breakthroughs in ESSs. Recently, many excellent reviews and reports on the preparation, modification, assembly, characterization, property, and engineering of nanostructured materials for energy storage applications have been published.5,55–65
This article reviews recent advancements and trends in nanostructured molybdenum oxides (MoOx, 2 ≤ x ≤ 3), dichalconides (MoX2, X = S, Se), and oxysalts for batteries and supercapacitors with high energy and power density. Their representative crystal structures are shown in Fig. 1. Mo-based oxides, dichalconides, and oxysalts possess multiple valence states and exhibit rich chemistry. Recent progress has demonstrated that nanostructured Mo-based compounds including MoO2, MoO3, MoO3−y (0 < y < 1), MMoxOy (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Ca, Mn, Zn, Mg, or Cd; x = 1, y = 4; x = 3, y = 8), MoS2, MoSe2, (MoO2)2P2O7, LiMoO2, Li2MoO3, etc. are very promising candidates for efficient electrochemical energy storage systems because of their unique physical and chemical properties, such as conductivity, mechanical and thermal stability, and cyclability. In this review, we present a summary on the synthesis, modification, and electrochemical performance of nanostructured Mo-based compounds. Also, their energy storage applications in the fields of LIBs, SIBs, Mg batteries, and pseudocapacitors are emphasized. The relationship between nanoarchitectures and electrochemical performances as well as related charge-storage mechanisms is discussed. This review ends with an outlook of Mo-containing compounds for further development in electrochemical energy storage applications.

2. Nanostructured Mo-based electrode materials for LIBs
2.1 MoO2
In general, the Li-storage mechanisms for metal oxide-based anodes can be classified into three types:66,67 insertion reaction, alloying–dealloying, and conversion reaction. A literature survey suggests that the oxides including early transition metal elements such as TiO2,66–75 V2O5,76,77 and MoO278,79 are often found to be lithiated though the insertion reaction. In contrast, the other ones like CoO,80,81 MnO,82–85 and Fe2O386 follow the conversion–reaction mechanism. The difference of their Li-cycling reactions is probably related to the metal–oxygen bond strength. The conversion reaction in metal oxides requires a heterogeneous charge transfer at the interfaces, Li+ and O2− in the solid state, and M–O bond cleavage. The former group has a relatively stronger metal–oxygen bond. For instance, the bond dissociation energy of Mo–O in MoO2 is about 678 kJ mol−1, which is much higher than 368 kJ mol−1 for Co–O in CoO.87 Therefore, the insertion reaction occurs in MoO2 without bond cleavage at ambient temperature. MoO2 crystallizes in a monoclinic cell as illustrated in Fig. 1. In MoO2 octahedra are distorted and Mo atoms are off-centre, leading to alternating short and long Mo–Mo distances and Mo–Mo bonding.88 MoO2 has low metallic electrical resistivity (8.8 × 10−5 Ω cm at 300 K in bulk samples), a high melting point, and excellent chemical stability.89 It has been extensively investigated in LIBs, supercapacitors, solid state fuel cells, catalysis, sensors, recording media, and electrochromic displays due to its efficient charge transport properties.90–95

2.1.1 Lithium-storage mechanism. 
As a matter of fact, the Li-insertion behavior in MoO2 was investigated 30 years ago.96 However, its electrochemical Li-storage performance receives little attention due to the sluggish kinetics in bulk MoO2. So far, several Li-cycling mechanisms for amorphous and crystalline MoO2 anodes in LIBs have been proposed, but some of them are still controversial at present. Actually, the crystal size and crystallinity of MoO2 materials should determine the specific electrochemical reactions. Therefore, none of the given mechanisms is absolutely suitable for all of the cases in MoO2-based electrodes. As summarized below, four representative Li-cycling mechanisms have been proposed for MoO2.
(i) One-electron insertion (ordered LixMoO2). 
Bulk or micrometer-sized MoO2 accommodates Li usually through an insertion-type reaction with a theoretical capacity of 209 mA h g−1.76MoO2 + xLi+ + xe−1 ↔ LixMoO2 (crystalline ordered, 0 < x < 1)
During electrochemical Li-cycling reactions, Li+ storage sites are crystallographically well-defined and the site amount determines Li+ storage capacity. The bulk or micrometer-sized MoO2-based electrodes based on the insertion–reaction mechanism (one-electron reduction) often suffers from poor cyclability and low capacity as a result of the phase transition of LixMoO2 from a monoclinic structure (0 < x < 0.5) to an orthorhombic structure (0.45 < x < 0.79).79
(ii) Four-electron conversion. 
Oh and coworkers studied the high-temperature lithiation behavior of the MoO2 electrode.97 It is found that the MoO2 electrode is lithiated with four-electron reduction by addition and continued conversion reactions at elevated temperatures. By means of thermoelectrochemical activation, the extension from one- to four-electron reduction is achieved. The initial crystalline MoO2 phase can be decomposed into a nanosized mixture of metallic Mo and Li2O, which is in turn converted to nanosized MoO2 upon forthcoming delithiation. During subsequent discharge–charge cycles, the as-formed nanosized MoO2 is fully lithiated up to four-electron reduction even at room temperature. Interestingly, the newly-formed nanosized MoO2 electrode through thermoelectrochemical activation delivers a reversible specific capacity that is close to the theoretical four-electron capacity of 838 mA h g−1 with an excellent cycle performance at room temperature. In this regard, nanosized MoO2 as the initial active material would be preferable for a high-capacity four-electron conversion reaction:MoO2 + 4Li+ + 4e− ↔ Mo + 2Li2O
With the rapid development of nanomaterial synthesis in recent decades, various well-defined MoO2-based nanostructures have been fabricated by advanced nanotechnology, offering elaborate candidates as high-capacity anodes for LIBs. As expected, reducing the particle size of MoO2 will enhance the kinetic barriers for the conversion reaction, arising from not only the enhanced heterogeneous charge transfer and solid-state Li+ and/or O2− diffusion, but also the weaker Mo–O bond strength of nanosized MoO2. In addition to thermoelectrochemical activation or nanostructuring, increasing defect sites is another effective way to improve the electrochemical performance of MoO2-based electrodes.98
(iii) Coupled insertion–conversion reaction. 
For nanostructured MoO2 materials, there exists a general phenomenon that the specific capacities increase gradually during initial charge and discharge cycles. Some researchers ascribed vaguely the capacity increase upon cycling to the activation of the MoO2 electrode. Recently, Zhang et al.99 and Guo et al.100 investigated the Li storage mechanism of nanosized MoO2 in detail by in situ or ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. In situ and ex situ XRD results indicate that the intermediate phase of Li0.98MoO2 is generated during the first lithiation cycle at the potential from 3.0 to 1.0 V. When further discharged from 1.0 to 0.01 V, the crystal phase of Li0.98MoO2 is mainly retained in the lithiated product. Only a part of intermediate Li0.98MoO2 undergoes a conversion reaction and then decomposes into Mo and Li2O during the first discharge cycle. The first discharge capacity is between 205 mA h g−1 (Li0.98MoO2) and 838 mA h g−1 (Li4MoO2). In the first delithiation process, both Li0.98MoO2 and Mo could be transformed into MoO2. During the initial 30 discharge–charge cycles, most of Li0.98MoO2 can reversibly convert into MoO2, while a part of Li0.98MoO2 is further reduced simultaneously to Li2O and Mo upon Li+ insertion.99 After about 30 discharge–charge cycles, the lithiation reaction of MoO2 shifts from an initial insertion type to a conversion mechanism, which is frequently observed in transition metal oxides. The overall electrochemical reactions of the MoO2 electrode can be simplified as:MoO2 ↔ Li0.98MoO2 ↔ Mo + Li2O
First principle calculations also provided an elementary explanation on the gradual increase in capacity upon cycling.101 Their calculations including geometry and electronic structure calculation are performed by using density function theory (DFT) on the basis of the projector augmented wave (PAW) method implemented in the VASP package. Average binding energy, density of states (DOS) and average cell voltage were calculated. Their calculation results showed that the binding energy in MoO2 is large, suggesting the stable nature of MoO2. If the lithiation extent of LixMoO2 increases, the average binding energy will decrease. Miao and coworkers also calculated the formation energy of Mo vacancies.101 The intercalation of Li in MoO2 would weaken both the Mo–Mo bond and the charge polarization of Mo vacancies, thus greatly reducing the formation energy of Mo vacancies in LixMoO2. The newly-formed Mo vacancies in LixMoO2 provide new active sites for Li storage, and therefore the capacity will be enhanced. Upon further continuous cycling, however, the capacity decays because of the broken structure of MoO2 as well as the irrepressible structural change.
(iv) Structural defects induced Li+ storage (disordering LixMoO2). 
Recently, Oh's group further demonstrated that structural defects in amorphous MoO2 could also serve as reversible Li+ storage sites for rechargeable LIBs.87 Amorphous MoO2 (a-MoO2) exhibits an unexpectedly high Li+ storage capacity (up to four Li per MoO2 unit), which is 4 times larger than that for the crystalline counterpart. Unexpectedly, Mo and Li2O in the lithiated a-MoO2 are not generated upon Li-cycling. Meanwhile, the local structural framework of a-MoO2 is maintained, suggesting that the conversion-type lithiation does not take place. The structural defects in a-MoO2 both facilitate Li+ diffusion pathways and increase Li+ mobility, which was evidenced by 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis.87MoO2 + xLi+ + xe−1 ↔ LixMoO2 (disordered Li+, x < 4)


2.1.2 Nanostructured MoO2. 
Several synthetic approaches, such as the hydrothermal–solvothermal process, magnetron-sputtering, rheological phase reaction, electrochemical deposition, and thermal evaporation, nanocasting, and thermal reduction, have been reported for preparing well-defined MoO2 nanostructures including nanoparticles,87,102–109 nanosheets,110 nanorods,100,111 nanotubes,99,111 hollow spheres,112–114 mesoporous structures,115,116 hierarchical architectures,117–119 and thin films120,121 as anode materials for LIBs. Nanostructuring of MoO2 can enhance the electrochemical performance, which cannot be achieved in bulk materials. In particular, the fabrication of a hierarchical nanostructure arouses much interest because of its extraordinarily high active surface/interface and robust stability. Electrode materials with hierarchical nanoarchitectures exhibit intriguing properties by taking advantage of both the nanometer-size effects and the high stability of the secondary-structure assemblies. Our group has reported a two-step method to grow a hierarchically nanostructured “cellulose” MoO2 monolith as a binder-free anode for LIBs, whereby the cotton texture acts as both a template and a stabilizer (Fig. 2).117 At first, a sheet of cotton cloth involving phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) was converted into a crystalline hierarchical MoO3 replica through thermal treatment in air. Then, a hierarchically nanoparticle-organized MoO2 monolith was obtained by thermal reduction in a (5%) H2/Ar atmosphere at 600 °C. The electrode made of the “cellulose” MoO2 monolith delivers a specific capacity of 719.1 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1. Zhao et al.114 reported a template-free one-step strategy to synthesize interconnected core–shell MoO2 hierarchical microcapsules via a solvothermal route. The nanostructured MoO2 capsules possess core–shell hierarchical architectures, featuring hollow cavities, porous shells, and interconnected walls. When evaluated for Li-storage properties, the hierarchical MoO2 capsules exhibit a high specific capacity of 749.3 mA h g−1 in the first discharge at 1 C and a high reversible capacity of 623.8 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles.

Mesoporous MoO2 materials have also attracted considerable interest as potential electrode materials in LIBs.116,122–126 Mesoporous structures can reduce solid-state diffusion lengths for both Li+ and e− due to the nanosized walls (<10 nm), efficiently facilitate solvated Li+ transport through the mesopore channels (>2 nm), and improve the charge capacity because of intrinsic high surface areas. Hu and coworkers116 synthesized highly ordered crystallized MoO2 with a three-dimensional (3D) bicontinuous cubic symmetry (Ia3d) mesostructure via a nanocasting strategy. The mesoporous silica template KIT-6 filled with PMA was thermally treated at 500–700 °C in a diluted H2 gas flow (10% H2 + 90% Ar), and the template was subsequently removed by HF. Electrochemical testing showed that this electrode made of mesoporous MoO2 had a typical metallic conductivity with low resistivity and exhibited a reversible capacity as high as 750 mA h g−1 at C/20 (41.9 mA g−1) after 30 cycles. Similarly, tungsten-doped MoO2 was also synthesized by the nanocasting method using a sacrificing template of mesoporous KIT-6.115 W-doping could help mesoporous MoO2 to fully react with Li and the “activation process” disappeared. The W-doped MoO2 material created an optimized electrode configuration by combining the advantages of the high theoretical capacity of MoO2 and the high electroactivity of WO2. This leads to an overall performance that is better than that of MoO2 or WO2. However, those mesoporous MoO2-based nanostructures are carbon-free, and the MoO2 nanocrystals are unprotected. During the continuous Li+ insertion–extraction cycles, especially for the conversion reaction involving ultrafine Mo and Li2O, the structural stability of the whole electrode would be problematic, thus resulting in rapid capacity fading. To further improve cyclability and rate capability, ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) was used as both the nanoreactor and the reduction agent for the fabrication of MoO2–OMC nanocomposites.127,128 OMC could act as the branches to connect MoO2 nanoparticles and build up a network to ensure good electrical contact of MoO2–MoO2 and MoO2–C to increase reaction kinetics. At the same time, OMC with a mechanical buffer function alleviated the volume expansion and contraction and prevented the agglomeration of MoO2 nanoparticles during Li+ insertion–extraction processes.128 By using mesoporous carbon CMK-3 as both the template and the reactant, Zhang et al.111 recently reported the synthesis of hierarchical porous MoO2/Mo2C heteronanotubes through a one-step carbothermal reduction method (Fig. 3a and b). Instead of carbon, conducting Mo2C with a high conductivity (1.02 × 102 S cm−1) was introduced into the final nanocomposite of porous MoO2/Mo2C heteronanotubes. Cycled at 200 and 1000 mA g−1 for 140 cycles, the discharge capacity of MoO2/Mo2C heteronanotubes could remain at 790 and 510 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 3c and d). Nevertheless, Mo2C in the nanocomposite MoO2/Mo2C heteronanotubes is electrochemically inactive, which will reduce the energy density of the electrode. Moreover, transition metal nitrides (e.g., Mo2N, WN, and TiN) also have high conductivity, in addition to high chemical resistance, hardness, mechanical strength and high melting points. Liu et al.129 reported a carbon-free nanocoating strategy for large-scale synthesis of Mo2N-nanolayer-coated MoO2 hollow nanostructures. The as-formed Mo2N-nanolayer-coated MoO2 hollow nanostructures exhibit highly reversible capacity of 815 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, good cyclability, and high rate capability. The carbon-free nanocoating of Mo2N is effective, and endows electrode materials with high surface stability and long cycle life, in comparison to the carbon nanocoating commonly used in other electrode materials.

2.1.3 MoO2–carbon nanohybrids. 
Based on literature studies and our own research on MoO2 in the past several years, reducing the particle size, for example, to nanosize, is possible to achieve high specific capacity via a conversion–reaction mechanism or coupled insertion–conversion reactions. However, the long-term Li cyclability in MoO2 is normally found to be poor, and severe capacity fading occurs upon 10–30 discharge–charge cycles. This is mainly due to the aggregation and/or pulverization of the highly active electrode involving ultrafine particles, the volume change, and intensive side reactions between the electrode and the electrolyte. It is well known that carbonaceous hybridization of nanostructured MoO2 would effectively both enhance the Li-insertion kinetics and improve the Li-cyclability. To date, a variety of carbon-based MoO2 nanocomposites with unique architectures have been reported. Some of the recent data on the Li-cycling properties of the MoO2–C nanocomposite are listed in Table 1. For the metal oxides based on the conversion reaction mechanism, the large volume change could result in pulverization and aggregation of the active materials, thus decreasing the reversible capacity upon cycling. Also, those transition metal oxides are normally electrically insulting. We and others have shown that it is highly desirable to grow small metal oxide nanoparticles on (or in) a carbon-based matrix to shorten diffusion length of ions and expedite electron transport, enhancing the capacity, rate capability and cycle life.130–132 Among the various carbonaceous materials, graphene typically exhibits superior electrical conductivity, large surface area, structural flexibility, and chemical stability. It can host nanostructured electrode materials for energy applications.133–135 The graphene layers can offer a support for anchoring nanoparticles and work as a highly conductive matrix providing good contact between them. Importantly, graphene layers prevent the volume expansion–contraction and the aggregation of nanoparticles effectively during charge and discharge processes. Meanwhile, the integration of inorganic nanostructures with the graphene layers may reduce the restacking of graphene sheets and consequently maintain the high surface area.45 In this regard, both the lithium-storage capacity and the cycling performance of graphene-based nanomaterials will be improved. We reported the large-scale fabrication of unprecedented self-assembled hierarchical MoO2–graphene nanoarchitectures through a facile solution-based method combined with a subsequent reduction process (Fig. 4a), where nanostructured MoO2 was first stabilized by reduced graphene oxide sheets.136 PMA and graphene oxide (GO) reacted with hydrazine hydrate in solution to produce a Mo-precursor–graphene composite. Then, the resulting composite was further annealed at 500 °C for 5 h in a reducing H2/Ar atmosphere, and self-assembled hierarchical MoO2–graphene nanoarchitectures were finally formed. Our results showed that the electrode made of the resulting hierarchical MoO2–graphene delivered a high capacity of 597.9 mA h g−1 over 70 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of ∼98% at a high current density of 1000 mA g−1 (Fig. 4b and c). In order to buffer the volume effect arising from the conversion reaction, we further proposed a simple impregnation–reduction–carbonization (IRC) route for the assembly of ultrafine MoO2 nanoparticles (<2 nm) into a carbon cloth.137 Interestingly, the MoO2–C composite exhibited excellent cycling stability (600 cycles) and a high reversible capacity of 734 mA h g−1 as an anode material for LIBs. Our results showed that ultrafine MoO2 nanoparticles embedded in the nanoporous carbon matrix would be highly favorable for the conversion reaction. The MoO2 nanoparticles with high surface area and abundant surface defects may enhance the heterogeneous charge transfer kinetics, ion diffusion, and capacity. In particular, the nanoporous nature of the as-formed hybrid could not only facilitate fast Li-ion and electron transport but also act as an elastic buffer to prevent the mechanical failure and volume effect, thus leading to the high stability during the conversion reaction process. Another important progress is that Bhaskar et al.138 improved cyclability by uniform entrapment of MoO2 nanoparticles in 2D graphene scaffolds. The unique layered nanostructure and the conductive matrix provided uninhibited conducting pathways for fast charge transfer and transport between the oxide nanoparticles and graphene which are responsible for the high rate capability, a large Li-ion capacity of 770 mA h g−1, and an excellent cycling stability (550 mA h g−1 reversible capacity retained even after 1000 cycles) at a current density of 540 mA g−1.

2.1.4 MoO2 additive. 
In addition to the direct use as active materials, MoO2 is attractive as a conducting additive to modify other electrode materials for LIBs because of its high electric conductivity and chemical stability. For instance, we prepared MoO2-modified TiO2 nanofibers, comprising a core of TiO2 nanofibers and a thin metal-like MoO2 nanolayer, through electrospinning and layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly processes.158 The thickness of the MoO2 nanolayer could be tuned easily by altering the precursor concentration or the LBL cycles. Results showed that the electrochemical performance of surface-modified TiO2 was distinctively improved, compared with the pure TiO2 nanofibers. The MoO2-modified TiO2 nanofibers exhibited a high discharge capacity of 514.5 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C over 50 cycles and excellent rate capability. This also demonstrates that enhanced physical and/or chemical properties can be achieved through proper surface modification. Besides, MoO2 was also reported to modify the surface of the LiFePO4/C electrode materials.159 Despite the low electric resistivity of MoO2, its own structural instability needs to be evaluated when it is employed as an additive or modification agent to improve the surface nature of other electrode materials. In particular, MoO2 may be oxidized to a higher oxidation state, when used at a high potential. Also, the thickness and the uniformity of the MoO2 layer are crucial to the Li+ storage performance of MoO2-modifed nanocomposite electrode materials.


2.1.5 Other MoO2-based nanocomposites. 
Other carbon-stabilized MoO2 anode materials for LIBs include carbon-coated MoO2 nanoparticles,144,148,150 nanofibers,153,160 and nanobelts,157 nanosized MoO2 in porous carbon,127,128,145,152 MoO2/multiwalled carbon nanotubes,148 and MoS2 coated MoO2 nanonetworks.161 The MoO2@MoS2 nanocomposite is composed of nanocrystalline–nanoporous MoO2 partially covered with few atomic layers of MoS2.161 The obtained porous MoO2@MoS2 networks delivered a reversible capacity as high as 1163 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 after 80 cycles. Reversible capacities of 1125 and 654 mA h g−1 were also achieved at current densities of 200 and 500 mA g−1 after 80 cycles, respectively. Yoon and Manthiram162 reported a microwave-assisted hydrothermal process to prepare carbon-decorated WOx–MoO2 (x = 2 and 3) nanorods as anode materials. The WOx–MoO2 anodes showed excellent capacity retention as the carbon could provide an elastic matrix for absorbing the volume expansion–contraction smoothly and prevent aggregation of the WOx–MoO2 nanorods during cycling.

2.2 MoO3

2.2.1 Crystal structure. 
MoO3 is an attractive example of a prospective electrode material for LIBs with high capacity. It has been investigated as both cathode and anode materials because of its unique layered structure.163–165 Two basic polymorphs of MoO3 include thermodynamically stable orthorhombic α-phase and metastable monoclinic β-phase with a ReO3-type structure (Fig. 5).166 The most important characteristic of α-MoO3 is the structural anisotropy. The crystal phase of α-MoO3 possesses an orthorhombic layered structure parallel to (010) planes. Each layer is composed of two interleaved sub-layers, each of which is formed by corner-sharing octahedra along [001] and [100]; the two sub-layers stack together by sharing the edges of the octahedra along [001].167 An alternate stack of these layered sheets along [010] would lead to the formation of α-MoO3, where van der Waals interaction would be the major binding force between the piled sheets.168

2.2.2 MoO3 cathodes. 
In 1970s MoO3 was proposed as a cathode material for secondary solid-state ion batteries.163,164,169–175 As shown in Fig. 6, two types of empty sites are available for hosting foreign ions like Li+.166 The interlayer distance has been determined to be 6.929 Å.176 The reversible electrochemical behaviour of MoO3 electrodes can be explained on the grounds of topotactic redox reactions. The interleaved sheets of MoO6 octahedra are retained as two-dimensional matrix units during the insertion and deinsertion processes. Although the guest ions can be well accommodated without structural change in principle, the spacing between the interlayers in the MoO3 host could be enlarged due to lithium uptake.177–179 The overall redox reaction of intercalation could be described as:176MoO3 + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixMoO3

The kinetically accessible charge range amounts to 0.1 ≤ x < 1.5 with the lower limit of x depending on the precedent cathodic load.170 At the initial cathodic stage of Li+ uptake, it is proved that two phases of MoO3 and LixMoO3 (x < 0.25) coexist at a potential of around 2.8 V vs. Li. A second cathodic stage involves the solid solution of LixMoO3 (0.25 < x < 0.5) at the potentials ranging from 2.8 to 2.4 V. At the final cathodic stage, the solid solution of LixMoO3 (1 < x < 1.5) is present at the potential lower than 2.4 V. Reduction beyond x = 1.5 would result in irreversible changes in the oxide structure. Also, complete re-oxidation (Li+ extraction) to the binary oxide is kinetically hindered presumably, as a result of small structural changes. It has been reported that the accessible range of reversible Li+ intercalation–deintercalation is 0.1 ≤ x < 1.5.180 The electronic conductivity of LixMoO3 depends on the x value.181 In general, the conductivity increases with x up to a maximum value, and then drops significantly upon further Li+ intercalation. Namely, the conductivity is relatively poor at the end of discharge. On the other side, the completely charged state, the oxide MoO3 is practically an insulator. The specific conductivity of LixMoO3 (prepared by lithiation with n-butyl lithium) in the range of 0.3 ≤ x ≤ 0.9 was in the order of 10−1 S cm−1, with a maximum value at x = about 0.6.181 The electronic and Li+-ionic conductivity of LixMoO3 varies with x by orders of magnitude. Mai and coworkers182 proved that the electroactivity of MoO3 nanobelts was highly improved through lithiation. The lithiated MoO3 nanobelts exhibited excellent cycling capability, with a capacity retention rate of 92% after 15 cycles, while the non-lithiated nanobelts retained only 60% (Fig. 6). Transport measurements also showed that the conductivity of a lithiated MoO3 nanobelt (10−2 S cm−1) is increased by nearly two orders of magnitudes compared to that of a non-lithiated MoO3 nanobelt (10−4 S cm−1).


2.2.3 MoO3 anodes. 
Utilization of MoO3 as an anode material has been paid much attention during the past decade. When tested in the potential window of 0.01–3.0 V vs. Li, MoO3 has been found to follow the conversion–reaction mechanism:183MoO3 + 6Li+ + 6e− ↔ 3Li2O + Mo
The theoretical specific capacity reaches as high as 1117 mA h g−1, which approximates three times larger than that of graphite. However, poor ionic and electronic conductivity of MoO3 often limits its electrochemical performance. Nanostructuring, carbon hybridization, and pre-lithiation are the general strategies for improving the capacity, rate capability and cycle life.183–199 For instance, Choi and Kang employed the crumpled graphene sheets as substrates to grow MoO3 nanoparticles by spray pyrolysis and a subsequent thermal treatment.184 The initial discharge capacity of ∼1490 mA h g−1 at a current density of 2000 mA g−1 was achieved, and the capacity of 975 mA h g−1 could be maintained after 90 cycles. Lou et al.196 prepared ultralong MoO3 nanobelts with an average length of 200–300 μm and a uniform width of around 0.6–1.5 μm via a hydrothermal method. They also proposed the use of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC) as the binder for assembly of the MoO3 electrode, which delivered a high specific capacity of over 730 mA h g−1 for over 200 cycles at a 0.2 C rate. Even when cycled at high rates of 1–2 C, high capacities of around 430–650 mA h g−1 could still be retained. As demonstrated, the Na-CMC binder should play a crucial role in improving the cyclability of MoO3. The Na-CMC binder can dissolve in water with a fully stretched molecular conformation because of the rigid long chains and the electrostatic repulsive interactions between ionized carboxy groups. Therefore, homogeneous 3D networks between the conductive agent and active material particles may be formed, leading to a tightened electrode architecture. These findings demonstrate that selecting a suitable polymer binder would help to optimize the performance of metal oxide electrodes, especially for those undergoing drastic volume and structure changes upon lithiation. Hassan et al.187 prepared carbon-coated MoO3 nanobelts that exhibited a high capacity of about 1000 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C. Dillon's group188 investigated the reversible Li+-insertion behaviour of MoO3 nanoparticles prepared by a hot-wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) technique. The anode made of MoO3 nanocrystals displayed both a durable reversible capacity of 630 mA h g−1 and durable high rate capability. The capacity did not decay after 150 cycles at a C-rate of C/2 between 3.5 and 0.005 V, compared to micrometer-sized MoO3 particles where the capacity faded quickly. First-principle calculations by Dillon et al.188 also indicated that the MoO3 nanoparticles maintained some structural integrity due to the heavy Mo-framework, in spite of a large volume expansion. Combining the XRD results with the theoretical calculations, Dillon et al.188 considered that amorphization of MoO3, instead of conversion reactions, could occur during the Li-cycling processes.

2.3 MoO3−x
Substoichiometric molybdenum oxide (MoOx, 2 < x < 3) or reduced molybdenum oxide is another attractive electrode material and possesses all the advantages that MoO3 has.200–206 Moreover, the conductivity can be improved as a result of the intrinsic oxygen vacancies, compared to MoO3. However, those oxygen deficient structures in early studies were limited by low recharge efficiency and poor cycling stability. Christian et al.200 studied the electrochemical behaviour of Mo4O11 (MoO2.75), Mo17O47 (MoO2.765), Mo8O23 (MoO2.889), and Mo9O26 (MoO2.875) cathode materials using a LiClO4/propylene carbonate electrolyte. Among them, Mo17O47 exhibited the greatest reversible capacity (1.5 Li/Mo) after several deep discharge–charge cycles in the potential range between 2.9 and 1.4 V. It was also found that the Li+-diffusion coefficients and the variations of lattice parameters of the non-stoichiometric Mo oxides depended on the depth of discharge.207 Fuentes and coworkers synthesized reduced molybdenum oxide, Mo4O11, by a solid state reaction between MoO3 and MoO2.205 Two polymorphs of orthorhombic γ-Mo4O11 and monoclinic γ′-Mo4O11 were investigated as the cathode materials. They incorporated a similar number of Li+ per metal atom (Li/Mo = 2.12 and 2.25, respectively). Detailed studies on the insertion reaction kinetics suggested that the insertion-induced reduction of γ-Mo4O11 and γ′-Mo4O11 went through different mechanisms.205 Solid-state lithium batteries fabricated by the thin film technology are attracting interest as micro-batteries. Ohtsuka et al.204 prepared Li/MoO3−x thin film batteries by using a RF sputtering method, in which MoO3−x has a larger specific capacity than other cathode films (e.g., LiMn2O4 film). At the discharge current density of 10 μA cm−2, the thin-film Li/MoO3−x batteries had discharge capacities of 290 mA h cm−2, and hold the promise for flexible energy-storage devices as well as further miniaturization. Jung et al.202 prepared nanostructured MoO3−y powders as anode materials by ball-milling. Oxygen deficiency increased with the milling time. The ball-milled MoO3−y could uptake more than 6 Li/Mo by an addition reaction followed by a conversion reaction, wherein the reactivity was strongly dependent on the oxygen deficiency. The ball-milled MoO3−y samples exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 1100 mA h g−1 with capacity fading upon cycling (∼620 mA h g−1 after 35 cycles). Compared to bulk MoO3, ball-milled MoO3−y powders displayed significantly improved cyclability, possibly arising from the smaller crystallite size and/or low crystalline nature. Sunkara et al.203 grew vertical nanowire arrays of MoO3−x on metallic substrates in a hot-filament chemical vapor deposition reactor. At a current density of 50 mA g−1, the nanowire arrays of MoO3−x showed a high-capacity retention of ∼630 mA h g−1 for up to 20 cycles. Besides the progress in electrode materials for Li+-ion batteries, the substoichiometric molybdenum oxides have been recently used to enhance hole exchange in optoelectronic devices based on organic semiconductors (OSCs), such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs), because of their improved n-type conductivity originating from intrinsic oxygen vacancies.208
2.4 Hydrated Mo-based oxides
Li insertion in hydrated Mo-based oxides has been investigated as cathodes for LIBs. As described above (Fig. 5), anhydrous MoO3 contains double sheets of MoO6 octahedra. In contrast, single sheets are found in hydrated MoO3 (MoO3·H2O, MoO3·2H2O).175 By dehydration, the intercalated water could be first lost, and then neighboring sheets condense into double sheets as the final water is lost.209 Julien et al.210–213 performed in-depth studies of hydrated MoO3 for cathode applications. Polycrystalline MoO3·0.5H2O and amorphous MoO3·H2O were prepared by an ionic resin exchange technique.210 It was found that the chemical diffusion coefficient of Li+ ions for polycrystalline MoO3·0.5H2O decreased from ∼3 × 10−8 to 3 × 10−9 cm2 s−1 as the number of inserted Li+ increased from 0.05 to 1.5. For amorphous MoO3·H2O, however, the diffusion coefficient remained nearly the same with Li insertion at a higher value of ∼3 × 10−8 cm2 s−1. The decrease in the diffusion coefficient for MoO3·0.5H2O is probably a result of the interfacial blocking effect in the polycrystalline material.210 In addition, MoO3·2/3H2O was found to show a maximum diffusion coefficient of ∼5 × 10−9 cm2 s−1 at the Li-inserting extent of 0.7 Li+/MoO3.211 Electrochemical Li-insertion results on amorphous MoO3·2H2O showed that its reaction kinetics was superior to both anhydrous MoO3 and other hydrated Mo-based oxides. However, its initial Coulombic efficiency was only 55%, which could be attributed to the irreversible reaction between the inserted Li and the coordinated water in the hydrate host.214,215
2.5 Mo-containing oxysalts

2.5.1 MMoO4 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Ca, Mn, or Zn). 
Mo-containing mixed oxides are attractive as “hosts” for lithium insertion, while the combination of two metals in oxide-matrices produces the materials with new structures and chemical properties compared to that of binary metal oxides.216–226 In particular, ternary metal oxides can form flexible crystal structures or phases depending on the synthetic conditions and compositions, and thus a large variety of systems could be modeled and explored. Calcium molybdate, CaMoO4, adopts a tetragonal scheelite structure with the Mo in tetrahedral O-coordination.222,224,225 Chowdari's group prepared carbon-coated nanophase CaMoO4 by solution precipitation and sol–gel methods.225 The in situ C-coating during the precipitation of CaMoO4 produced uniform and smooth particles of 1–2 μm in size. Well-separated CaMoO4 nanocrystallites with sizes in the range of 50–80 nm were obtained by the sol–gel synthesis. Galvanostatic cycling was carried out over 50 cycles in the range of 0.005–2.5 V at a current rate of 10 mA g−1 for the first two cycles and at 60 mA g−1 for all other cycles. Cycling was also performed with upper cutoff voltages of 2.0 and 3.0 V for the sol–gel and C-coated CaMoO4. It was found that the cutoff voltage of 2.5 V exhibited the best performance. The C-coating enabled high inter-particle electronic conductivity of the otherwise insulating CaMoO4, leading to the best performance of carbon-coated CaMoO4 nanoparticles with a specific capacity of 508 mA h g−1 and a Coulombic efficiency higher than 98%. A plausible mechanism involving the formation–decomposition of the oxide bronze “LixMoOy” was proposed for the first discharge and subsequent charge–discharge cycling of CaMoO4.
Yu and coworkers218 reported a general hydrothermal route for preparing different phases and morphologies of molybdate hydrates MMoO4·nH2O (M = Co, Ni, Mn, n = 0, 3/4, 1) nano/microcrystals, whereby NiMoO4·H2O microflowers, MnMoO4·H2O microparallelogram plates, and CoMoO4·3/4H2O microrods could be selectively synthesized (Fig. 7). After further annealing at a temperature of 500–550 °C, they could be transformed into anhydrous molybdates. The electrochemical Li-storage performances of MMoO4 (M = Ni, Co) nanorod bundles and MnMoO4 microrods were evaluated. The first reversible discharge specific capacity for NiMoO4 could reach up to 850 mA h g−1 at 0.1 mA cm−2 within a potential range of 1.2–4.0 V, which is higher than those for CoMoO4 (130 mA h g−1) and MnMoO4 (180 mA h g−1). It was proposed that such a high capacity of NiMoO4 was assigned to a large amount of vacancies in the structure of NiMoO4 nanorod bundles, in which Li+ ions could be reversibly incorporated.

Oriented 1D nanomaterials are acknowledged as one of the promising solutions to future-generation LIBs with high performances because of their large surface area, short transport path for ions and electrons, and buffering function for volume change.51,53,227 Lou's group reported the synthesis of AMoO4·nH2O (A = Ni, Co) nanorods through a hydrothermal method.228 The size of the nanorods could be easily controlled, and self-assembled growth of oriented NiMoO4·nH2O nanorod arrays on Ti-foil substrates was achieved. The resulting AMoO4 (A = Ni, Co) was investigated as the cathode materials for LIBs (Fig. 8). The capacities of about 120 mA h g−1 could be retained after 50 cycles. Kim et al.229 obtained NixCo1−xMoO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) nanowire electrodes by employing a hydrothermal method with post-annealing. The electrodes made of Ni0.75Co0.25MoO4 nanowires delivered a high reversible capacity of about 520 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles at a current density of 196 mA g−1. This enhanced electrochemical performance of Ni0.75Co0.25MoO4 nanowires with high Ni content was ascribed to their larger surface area and efficient electron transport path facilitated by their 1D nanostructure.

2.5.2 Mo-cluster oxysalts. 
In recent years, a number of interesting pioneering studies on hexagonal Mo-cluster compounds including LiHoMo3O8, A2Mo3O8 (A = Zn, Co), LiYMo3O8, and Mn2Mo3O8 as anode materials have been published by Chowdari's group.230,231 These studies are very important for understanding the Li-cycling mechanisms of the Mo-cluster oxides, and their potential applications in Li-storage devices. We recently prepared hierarchically nanostructured Mn2Mo3O8–graphene nanocomposites in large quantities through a facile two-step reduction approach.232 Typically, phosphomolybdic acid and manganese acetate reacted with hydrazine hydrate in solution, accompanied by the reduction of graphene oxide to graphene by hydrazine hydrate, leading to the formation of a Mn–Mo-precursor–graphene composite. Then, this intermediate product was further treated at 550 °C for 5 h in a reducing H2/Ar atmosphere to obtain the final product. As displayed in Fig. 9, a large number of hierarchical architectures consisting of secondary micro-spheres of ∼3–5 μm in diameter, are clearly observed. The high-magnification SEM images in Fig. 9a and b indicate that the hierarchical architectures are built from Mn2Mo3O8 nanosheets with a thickness of 10–15 nm and a width of 80–120 nm. The reversible capacity of the nanocomposite electrode reached 920 ± 5 mA h g−1 at the 20th cycle with a Coulombic efficiency of ∼98%. As shown in Fig. 9c, the reversible specific capacity gradually increased in the initial cycles and remained steady in the following cycles. After 40 discharge and charge cycles, the composite electrode still exhibited a reversible capacity of 950 ± 5 mA h g−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1. Fig. 9d shows the cycling behaviour of the Mn2Mo3O8–graphene hybrid at different charge–discharge current densities. Even at a high current density of 1500 mA g−1, the specific capacity was as high as 671 ± 5 mA h g−1, indicating the excellent rate capability. The enhanced capacity and cyclability of the nanocomposite could benefit from the synergistic effects of the nanohybridization: the unique hierarchical nanoarchitectures composed of the primary Mn2Mo3O8 nanocrystals and ultrathin graphene sheets. The role of graphene during cycling reaction, and the Li-cycling mechanism for the hierarchically structured Mn2Mo3O8–graphene nanohybrid are worth further investigation. Furthermore, we recently develop a facile and scalable strategy to prepare the Fe2Mo3O8–reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposites through a solution-based method combined with a subsequent heat treatment process.233 Fe2Mo3O8 nanoparticles of 10–15 nm were uniformly distributed on the rGO nanosheets. The Fe2Mo3O8–rGO electrode delivered a high specific capacity of 835 mA h g−1 after 40 discharge–charge cycles at 200 mA g−1. A possible Li-cycling mechanism was proposed based on in situ XRD analyses. It was found that the reversible conversion reaction involved the decomposition of Fe2Mo3O8 and the formation of metallic Mo, Fe and Li2O upon cycling.

2.5.3 Bronze Mo-based oxides. 
As well known, α-MoO3 readily takes part in topotactic reactions because of its unique layered crystal structure.163,170,177 Mo-based bronzes (AxMoO3, A = H, Li, Mg, etc.) can be formed though intercalation of group IA and IIA ions, where α-MoO3 reacts with solids (e.g. LiI), vapors (e.g. CH3OH), and liquids (e.g. n-butyl lithium solutions), electrochemically in aqueous and nonaqueous media.134,179,234 The interlayer spacing (d) between the MoO3 slabs in the host structure is usually enlarged as a result of the foreign-ion uptake, but the guest ions would not disrupt the primary Mo–O bonding within the individual MoO3-type slabs. The electrochemical Li-insertion properties of bronze Mo-based oxides have aroused much attention for LIB applications. Combined electrochemical, NMR, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) research by Nazar et al.235 provided in-depth insight into the Li-cycling mechanism for bronze Na0.25MoO3. The Li-insertion behavior in Na0.25MoO3 at low potential can be summarized as:Na0.25MoO3 + 7.8(Li+ + e−) → y(Na, Li)2O + LizMoO3−y (2y + z = 7.8)
Nazar et al.236 also developed a general “chimie douce” method to prepare A0.25MoO3 (Na, Li, Sn) as anodes for LIBs. These materials presented large reversible charge capacities (>900 mA h g−1) with good cyclability. The volumetric capacities, on the order of 4000 mA h cm−3 (density for MoO3 is of 4.69), were three to four times greater than for carbon materials and twice that of Sn oxide-based glasses. It was also found that a soft heat treatment and an appropriate discharge cut-off potential would stabilize the charge capacity upon cycling (600 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles). However, the loss of irreversible capacity and the high charge potential are the main disadvantages in these bronze A0.25MoO3 materials. Introduction of Sn into the layered Mo-containing bronzes via an exchange process could lower the charge potential of the A0.25MoO3 materials.


2.5.4 Mo-based phosphates. 
Mo-based phosphates have rich crystal chemistry with a large number of structures containing tunnels, cages and micropores.237,238 So far, hundreds of molybdenum phosphates have been reported, and many of them with large surface areas can be used in ion exchange, catalysis, and separations.239,240 They consist of varied phosphate groups including monophosphate (PO43−), diphosphate (P2O74−), metaphosphate (PO3−), oxyphosphates, and even their mixture. Most structures of Mo-based phosphates are based on MoO6 octahedra that share their corners with PO4 tetrahedra to build up frameworks. Owing to the varied oxidation states and rich chemistry of Mo, Mo-based phosphates have been explored as potential cathodes with two or more electron transfers (unlike LiFePO4 with one-electron transfer per Fe2+/3+ redox center) for LIBs.241 Recent results of ab initio calculations by Hautier et al.242 suggest that Mo (Mo3+/4+, Mo4+/5+, Mo5+/6+) and V (V2+/3+, V3+/4+, V4+/5+) among thousands of known and virtual phosphate compounds are the only two multiple-valence elements that can possibly enable two or more electron transfers within the acceptable voltage window (3–4.5 V). Uebou et al.241 first investigated the electrochemical Li-insertion behaviours of γ-(MoO2)2P2O7 that possesses a 3D structure (Fig. 10). A specific capacity up to 250 mA h g−1 was achieved in the first discharge cycle. Intercalation processes at a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2 could be reversible with the Li-insertion extent of 0.85 < x < 4.0. More recently, Whittingham and coworkers reported a cathode material of layer-structured δ-(MoO2)2P2O7 that was prepared by heating a MoO2HPO4·H2O precursor at 560 °C.243 Electrochemical evaluation revealed that up to four Li ions per formula unit could be intercalated into δ-(MoO2)2P2O7 upon discharge to 2 V (Fig. 11). Three voltage plateaus were observed at 3.2, 2.6, and 2.1 V. The first plateau corresponds to the intercalation of 1.2 Li, forming δ-Li1.2(MoO2)2P2O7. Intercalation of the second Li leads to a different lithiated structure that is also reversible, delivering the capacity of 110 mA h g−1 at a potential range of 2.3–4 V. More Li+-intercalation would result in the loss of crystallinity and structural instability.243 Those results confirmed that Mo-based phosphates could provide a multi-electron redox center. However, the redox potential drops fast to below 3 V upon reduction of Mo to 5+, and the structure of δ-(MoO2)2P2O7 does not tolerate more than two Li+ per formula unit as its structure becomes amorphous. It still remains a significant challenge to use both Mo6+/5+ and Mo5+/4+ redox pairs, which could be achieved in the future by designing a novel structure. Moreover, it is expected that nanostructuring and hybridization of Mo-based phosphates may have unique properties and new applications.

2.5.5 Lithium molybdenum oxides. 
Considering the Li–Mo–O phase diagram as shown in Fig. 12, several phases appear to be stable in the MoO2–Li–MoO3 systems including LiMoO2, Li2MoO3, Li4Mo3O8, and Li0.74MoO2.244–247 LiMoO2, isostructural to widely known LiMO2 (M = Co, Mn, Ni, Fe) cathode materials for LIBs, holds the promise to be a Li storage material. Up to 0.85 Li per unit of “MoO2” can be reversibly accommodated in layered LiMoO2 at an average potential of 3 V with an initial capacity of about 200 mA h g−1.248 In comparison to LiCoO2, LiMoO2 has some different features although their crystal structures are similar. It is known that LixCoO2 (x ≤ 0.8) has a tendency to release oxygen and transform into Co3O4, whereas Li-free LixMoO2 could be obtained electrochemically or by soft oxidation with Br2 or I2.249 In addition, the existence of metallic Mo–Mo bonding in the LixMoO2 polymorph may influence the Li-insertion–extraction behaviors, but there are no metallic Co–Co bonds in LiCoO2. Recently, detailed in situ structural analysis by synchrotron diffraction in Mikhailova's group revealed a multi-phase extraction–intercalation mechanism in LixMoO2 over the composition range of 0.15 ≤ x ≤ 1.0 with some single-phase regions.248

James and Goodenough first reported the basic electrochemical Li-storage properties of Li2MoO3 and determined its structure by neutron Rietveld analysis.249 Li2MoO3 has the rhombohedral symmetry close to the α-NaFeO2 structure.250,251 The Mo4+/Mo6+ redox couple of Li2MoO3 can exchange multiple electrons and deliver a theoretical capacity of up to 339 mA h g−1.252 LiFeO2-incorporated Li2MoO3 was investigated as a cathode additive to improve the electrochemical performance of LiCoO2-based cathode systems.253 More recently, Ma et al.252,254 have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of replacing conventional Li2MnO3 with Li2MoO3 in building new layer-structured xLi2MoO3·(1 − x)LiMO2 (M = Mn, Co, Ni, etc.) cathode materials. Interestingly, several attractive features of Li2MoO3 are demonstrated including the nearly reversible Mo-ion migration to/from the Li vacancies, absence of oxygen evolution, and reversible phase transition during initial (de)lithiation. Therefore, Li2MoO3 would be an ideal replacement of Li2MnO3 in constructing Li2MoO3-based Li-rich cathode materials with high energy densities. Combined with advanced nanofabrication and nanocharacterization strategies, it is expected that some novel Li2MoO3-based Li-rich electrode materials with stronger structural stability and higher cycling reversibility would be developed for high-energy LIB applications.
Nearly all previously reported Li–Mo–O cathodes for LIBs possess ordered structures in which Li and Mo occupy distinct sites.244–251 Cation-disordered materials are routinely ignored as cathodes, considering that the disordered structures often hinder lithium diffusion in solid. Excitingly, this logic has been recently overturned by Lee et al.255 They found that lithium diffusion can be facile in disordered Li1.211Mo0.467Cr0.3O2 (LMCO) materials. LMCO with a layered rocksalt structure was synthesized through standard solid-state procedures, but transformed to a disordered rocksalt after just a few charge–discharge cycles. With the help of ab initio computations, such an unexpected behavior is attributed to percolation of a certain type of active diffusion channels in disordered Li-excess materials. These great findings will shed light on understanding and designing disordered-electrode materials with high capacity and higher energy density.

2.6 Mo-based dichalconides
Molybdenum dichalcogenides (MoX2, X = S, Se, Te) are layered transition-metal dichalcogenides that belong to a large two-dimensional (2D) family of the general formula MX2. Individual sandwiched X–Mo–X layers are held together by weak van der Waals interactions in hexagonally packed structures that are similar to the graphene layers in graphite. MoX2 occurs in the polytypes of hexagonal 2H-MoX2 and rhombohedral 3R-MoX2. Also, tetragonal 1T-MoS2 has been observed for single layers exfoliated from 2H- or 3R-MoS2 crystals.256 Because of the layered structure, a pronounced anisotropy of electrical conduction is observed, which is considerably (two or three orders of magnitude) more parallel to the planes. Perpendicular to the planes, conduction occurs by a hopping mechanism. As summarized in the recent comprehensive reviews,44,257–261 MoX2 exhibits a remarkably diverse range of unique optical, electrochemical, and mechanical properties. They have been widely used as functional materials in diverse fields of lubrication,262 electronic transistors,263 batteries,264 photovoltaics,265 catalysis,266 and sensing.267

2.6.1 MoS2 nanostructures. 
MoS2 is an attractive host for ion intercalation because of its rich intercalation chemistry and structural peculiarities. The application of MoS2 as a cathode for LIBs was patented and commercialized by Moli Energy in 1980.206,268–274 However, the lithiation voltage of MoS2 as a cathode is lower than that of other commercial cathode materials such as LiCoO2, thus reducing the energy density of a full cell. Even worse, the secondary Li/MoS2 batteries using MoS2 as the cathode and Li as the anode are prone to the growth of Li dendrites from the anode, which results in serious safety problems and poor cyclability. In contrast, MoS2 is becoming the hot subject of significant attention as an anode material for LIBs. In particular, the emergence of diverse nanostructures has recently led to a variety of high-performance anodes using MoS2 nanostructures and MoS2 nanocomposites. Nanostructuring and nanocarbon incorporation have been demonstrated as two effective approaches to improve the electrochemical performance of MoS2-based electrode materials. To date, various MoS2 nanostructured materials with diverse geometric shapes and morphologies, such as nanoflakes, nanotubes, nanoflowers, and hierarchical tubular architectures, have been intensively explored to enhance the cycling stability.15,275–283 Nevertheless, those nanostructures were often found to be destroyed upon continuous discharge–charge cycling. Graphene has been successfully demonstrated as one of the most important supports to enhance the performance of MoS2.195,284–299 For instance, Chang and Chen287 prepared layered MoS2–reduced graphene oxide (MoS2–rGO) composites by an L-cysteine-assisted solution-phase method. The resulting MoS2/rGO (1:2) composite displayed a 3D architecture composed of a large number of scaled and curved sheets in the range of 100–200 nm (Fig. 13a), and the layered MoS2 was supported on the surface of rGO (Fig. 13b). Compared to the electrodes made of pristine MoS2, MoS2/rGO (1:1), and MoS2/rGO (1:4), the MoS2/rGO (1:2) electrode delivered the highest specific capacity of ∼1100 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 without capacity fading after 100 cycles (Fig. 13c). Even at a high current density of 1000 mA g−1, the specific capacity of the MoS2/rGO (1:2) electrode remained at ∼900 mA h g−1, indicating an excellent rate capability (Fig. 13d). Moreover, amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes, carbon fibers, polyaniline nanowires, and so on have been explored as the elastic buffer layers/supports to enhance the stability of the MoS2-based anode materials.300–324

The Li-cycling mechanism of MoS2 as an anode has so far not been well understood, especially below the potential of 1.1 V vs. Li/Li+. The recent comprehensive review by Stephenson et al.260 has discussed the Li-insertion reactions in MoS2 in detail. Normally, intercalation of Li+ into MoS2 is known to occur within the potential range of 3–0 V vs. Li/Li+. Li+ insertion is considered to be fully reversible in the potential range of 3.0–1.1 V, and the electrochemical reaction can be described as:296,311,314MoS2 + xLi+ + xe− → LixMoS2 (∼1.1 V vs. Li/Li+)where x is in the range of 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. The theoretical specific discharge capacity of the above reaction is calculated to be 167 mA h g−1 (corresponding to LiMoS2). When the potential is below the plateau of ∼1.1 V, one or several disproportionation reactions takes place together with the presence of intermediate metastable sulfide species. For example, the lower plateau at about 0.6 V during the first discharge process has been assigned to the following reversible conversion reaction from MoS2 to Li2S and Mo:299,311,314LixMoS2 + (4 − x)Li+ + (4 − x)e− → Mo + 2Li2S (∼0.6 V vs. Li/Li+)
The theoretical specific capacity for the full conversion reaction (MoS2 + 4Li+ + 4e− → Mo + 2Li2S) is 669 mA h g−1. During the first delithiation cycle, a pronounced peak at ∼2.3 V was attributed to the delithiation of Li2S into S.278,304Li2S → 2Li+ + S + 2e− (∼2.3 V vs. Li/Li+)
During the second lithiation cycle, two new plateaus at ∼1.9 and 1.2 V appeared. The dominant cathodic peak at ∼1.9 V is well known in Li–S batteries. It is attributed to the formation of Li2S, and the smaller peak at ∼1.2 V could be the conversion of residual S82− into Li2S. In the charge (delithiation) process, only one plateau at ∼2.2 V was observed, corresponding to the oxidation of Li2S into S. After the first lithiation–delithiation cycle, the electrode could be changed into a mixture of S and Mo, instead of MoS2, based on the following reversible reaction that yields a theoretical capacity of 1675 mA h g−1 (if the weight of Mo is not taken into account):325Li2S + Mo ↔ 2Li + S + Mo
The functions of Mo as well as the additives like carbon allotropes in the nanocomposite electrode materials need to be further explored. Sometimes, the MoS2-based electrodes have exhibited high specific capacities that are larger than the theoretical value for the conversion reaction of MoS2 + 4Li+ + 4e− → Mo + 2Li2S. Although the exact Li-cycling mechanism for MoS2 remains still unclear at present, even little controversial, it is expected that the advanced in situ analytic techniques such as solid-state NMR and XAS, together theoretical simulations will help unveil the details.


2.6.2 MoSe2 nanostructured materials. 
As a close analogue to the layer structured MoS2, the electrochemical Li-storage performance of MoSe2 has seldom been reported.326,327 More recently, Shi et al.328 prepared highly ordered mesoporous crystalline MoSe2 by using mesoporous silica SBA-15 as a hard template via a nanocasting strategy (Fig. 14). The obtained products displayed a highly ordered hexagonal mesostructure and a rod-like particle morphology. When evaluated as an anode material, mesoporous MoSe2 delivered a reversible lithium-storage capacity of 630 mA h g−1 for at least 35 cycles without any evident decrease. It was found that the rate performance of mesoporous MoSe2 was much better than that of analogously synthesized mesoporous MoS2, making it a promising anode for the lithium-ion battery. Also, the as-obtained mesoporous MoSe2 as a photocatalyst showed remarkable photocatalytic activity for the degradation of organic compound in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation.328 Nanocarbon hybridization may also be a useful method to improve the properties of MoSe2 nanostructures, and may find new applications in optoelectronics, catalysis and sensing.

3. Mo-based nanostructures as electrode materials for SIBs
SIBs have recently drawn increasing attention because of their cheap raw material. Compared to LIBs, however, the larger size of Na+ (1.02 Å vs. 0.76 Å for Li+) hampers electrochemical reaction kinetics. Therefore, reversible electrode materials are required to possess large enough channels and/or interstitial sites. Particularly for the anodes of SIBs, the main issues include large polarization and rapid capacity fading. Considering the extreme reactivity of Na metal, it is also very crucial to find an alternative anode material to secure battery safety and realize the practical utilization of this energy-storage system. Recent findings have shown that the anode materials for SIBs based on alloy-type (e.g., Si, Sn, Ge, and SnO2) and conversion-type (e.g., CuO, Fe2O3, and FeS2) exhibited high initial capacity, but suffered from poor cyclability most likely due to the large volume change and the sluggish kinetics. In addition, some non-graphitic carbon (e.g., hard carbon and carbon spheres), organic anode materials (e.g., Na2C8H4O4), and titanium-based intercalation compounds (e.g., amorphous TiO2 and Na2Ti3O7) have been investigated as anode materials for SIBs. These anode materials have demonstrated a maximum reversible capacity in the range of 100–300 mA h g−1.
A large class of layered materials, namely, transition metal dichalcogenides are a potentially useful alternative to graphite as anodes for SIBs. For example, the atomic structure of layered MoX2 (X = S, Se and Te) is similar to graphite, characteristic of a strong in-plane covalent bonding and weak van der Waals interactions between X layers. Also, MoX2 have a larger interlayer slab space (e.g., ∼6.2 Å for MoS2) than graphite, offering a wide range of electron affinity for the intercalation of a guest ion. Among transition metal dichalcogenides, MoS2 with a well-defined layered structure has been intensively investigated as anode materials for rechargeable batteries. According to the terminal discharge voltage, the reactions in a Na–MoS2 battery proceed in two steps: intercalation and conversion, described as follows:MoS2 + xNa = NaxMoS2 (above 0.4 V, x < 2)NaxMoS2 + (4 − x)Na = Mo + 2Na2S (below 0.4 V)
Park et al.329 reported the possibility of using commercial MoS2 for Na-ion storage, and demonstrated a capacity of 85 mA h g−1 at 0.4−2.6 V over 100 cycles based on an intercalation–deintercalation reaction. Recently, ab initio calculations on Na-intercalation in all structural polytypes of MoS2 were conducted by Medhekar et al.330 Their findings revealed that Na ions are generally found to occupy octahedral or distorted octahedral sites within the interlayer van der Waals spaces upon intercalation. Na-ion intercalation in MoS2 causes a phase transformation at x = 0.39 from the 2H to 1T phase. However, it is thermodynamically stable across the entire concentration range of 0 < x < 1 against the phase separation of Na. The calculated energy barrier of 0.68 and 0.28 eV for Na-ion diffusion in 2H- and 1T-MoS2, indicating moderately fast charge and discharge rates, respectively. These results suggest that the 1T polytype obtained via exfoliation of the 2H polytype has better electrochemical performance arising from its inherent metallic electronic structure, higher capacity for Na ions and their fast motilities.330 Therefore, exfoliating layered structure into few-layer sheets or individual monolayers can allow for an enhanced adsorption of Na+ on both sides and faster diffusion rates. More recently, Chen et al.331 reported the synthesis of unique graphene-like MoS2 nanoflowers with expanded layers by a hydrothermal method (Fig. 15). By controlling the cut-off voltage to the range of 0.4–3 V, it was found that the reversible Na-insertion in MoS2 followed an intercalation mechanism, instead of a conversion mechanism. The electrode made of graphene-like MoS2 nanoflowers showed high discharge capacities of 350 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1, 300 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, and 195 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1 over up to 1500 cycles, indicating excellent rate capability and superior cyclability (Fig. 15). It is believed that the expanded and gradually exfoliated interlayers have contributed to the decreased barrier for Na+ insertion and extraction, thus reducing the charge transfer resistance and offering more active sites for Na+ storage. In addition, Choi et al.332 reported a liquid-phase exfoliation method to improve the exfoliation efficiency for single-layer MoS2 sheets in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) with the assistance of NaOH. The exfoliated MoS2 electrode showed a Na-intercalation capacity of 161 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1 over 50 cycles.

Besides Na-ion intercalation, pristine MoS2 has been proven to be converted into Mo and Na2S with additional substantial gain in capacity (∼3 Na+ reaction, ∼501 mA h g−1) when further deeply discharged to lower voltage (0.01 V).333 The discharge product, Na2S, could afford better conductivity than Na2O as typically formed from a deep conversion reaction of metal–oxide compounds.334 Another work by Chou et al.335 is that an exfoliated MoS2–C composite (E-MoS2–C) was prepared via simple chemical exfoliation and a hydrothermal reaction. The MoS2 nanoflower electrode exhibited a capacity of ∼400 mA h g−1 at 0.25 C (100 mA g−1) over 100 cycles. To address the issues of large volume change during the conversion reaction resulting in the formation of internal cracks, loss of electrical contact, and eventual failure of the electrode, nanostructuring or nanocarbon incorporation of MoS2 may be an effective strategy. For instance, Kim and coworkers proposed an electrospinning method to prepare 1D MoS2 nanofibers with a vine-like shape composed of MoS2 nanoflakes to improve Na-storage properties. Singh et al.336 fabricated layered free-standing paper composed of acid-exfoliated few-layer MoS2 and rGO flakes as a self-standing flexible electrode in SIBs. The electrode showed good Na cycling ability with a stable charge capacity of approximately 230 mA h g−1 with respect to total weight of the electrode. More recently, Maier et al.324 prepared single-layered MoS2 ultrasmall nanoplates embedded in carbon nanowires by electrospinning. The nanohybrid delivered specific capacities of 854 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, 484 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, and 253 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1 over 100 cycles, demonstrating the excellent rate capability of the MoS2–C nanocomposite anode for SIBs.
Compared to MoS2, MoSe2 has been seldom studied as an anode material for SIBs. Tirado et al.327 demonstrated the possibility of Na+ intercalation in MoSe2 based on a Na-intercalation–deintercalation reaction mechanism. Recently, Kang et al.337 prepared yolk–shell-structured MoSe2 microspheres via a simple selenization process of MoO3 microspheres. The yolk–shell-structured MoSe2 and MoO3 microspheres delivered initial discharge capacities of 527 and 465 mA h g−1, respectively, in the voltage range of 0.001–3 V vs. Na/Na+ at 0.2 A g−1. Their discharge capacities were found to be 433 and 141 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, respectively. The hierarchical yolk–shell structure comprised of wrinkled nanosheets facilitated fast Na-ion and electron kinetics, and buffered the large volume changes encountered during conversion-type cycling.
4. Mo-based nanostructures as cathode materials for Mg batteries
Mg batteries have been long pursued as a highly promising technology for energy storage and conversion. The first working Mg rechargeable battery prototypes were successfully developed in 2000,24 using ethereal solutions containing magnesium halo–alkyl aluminate complex electrolytes. Since then, more profound understanding of several types of complex solutions in which Mg electrodes are reversible has been achieved. Despite these advances, two main obstacles of kinetically sluggish Mg intercalation/diffusion in cathodes and incompatibility between Mg anodes and electrolytes prohibit Mg batteries from practical applications.29 A variety of candidates have been proposed in recent years for rechargeable Mg batteries. In particular, Mo-containing cathode materials are intensively explored among those Mg-intercalation cathode materials. For instance, molybdenum chalcogenides, MxMo6T8 (M = metal, T = S, Se, Te, or their combination), also known as Chevrel phases, can intercalate various divalent ions.338–346 They possess a special crystallographic structure comprising pseudo-cubic cavities between Mo6T8 blocks (i.e. octahedral clusters of Mo atoms in a side cubic anionic framework). It has been demonstrated that Mo6S8 can intercalate Mg2+ ions reversibly according to the reaction: Mo6S8 + 2Mg2+ + 4e− ↔ Mg2Mo2S8.28 As shown in Fig. 16,28 the unique crystal structure of Mo6S8 facilitates the fast insertion kinetics of bivalent Mg2+ ions, benefiting from a large number of vacant sites, short distances between them, and the metallic Mo6 clusters that easily compensates the charge-unbalance due to the introduction of bivalent Mg2+ ions.

Recently, nanostructured MoO3 and MoS2 with a layered crystal structure have been developed as promising cathode materials for Mg batteries, because of their structural flexibility to accommodate the severe structural deformation upon insertion of bivalent Mg2+ ions. Chen et al.347 prepared graphene-like MoS2 (G-MoS2) via a solvothermal route from the reaction of MoO3 with thioacetamide in pyridine. Combined with the use of ultrasmall Mg nanoparticles of ∼2.5 nm in size as the anode, the G-MoS2 cathode achieved a high operating voltage of 1.8 V, an initial discharge capacity of 170 mA h g−1, and capacity retention of 95% upon 50 discharge–charge cycles. Based on a formula unit of Mo20S40 (a width of ∼1.2 nm) as a representative model for a MoS2 monolayer, density functional theory calculations show that each Mg atom could be coordinated by three S atoms at a distance of about 2.5 Å, and a formula unit of Mg4Mo6S12 is derived.348 The electrochemical reactions in the cathode of single-layered MoS2 in Mg batteries could be simplified as: 6MoS2 + 4Mg2+ + 8e− ↔ Mg4Mo6S12. Li's group349 reported the solution synthesis of MoS2 hollow-cage fullerene-like nanoparticles, fibrous floccus, and spherical nanovesicles. The electrodes made of these MoS2 nanostructures showed enhanced reversibility upon Mg-ion intercalation–extraction cycling compared to bulk MoS2 powders. More recently, Jiao et al.350 demonstrated that sandwich-structured MoS2–rGO serving as a cathode in Mg batteries delivered 104.2 and 74.1 mA h g−1 after 30 and 50 cycles, respectively.
Aurbach's group351 performed detailed investigations by electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis of Mg2+ intercalation into thin-film electrodes of layered MoO3. It was found that thin-film electrodes of MoO3 delivered a high reversible capacity of 220 mA h g−1 at a potential of 1.8 V vs. Mg2+/Mg. A two-phase reaction may occur during the magnesium of MoO3. In contrast to Li+ ions, higher overpotential is needed for intercalation–deintercalation of Mg2+ in the MoO3 host. Besides the aforementioned systems, the search for a suitable nanostructured cathode and a less passivated anode/electrolyte configuration is intrinsically urgent for developing rechargeable Mg batteries. For more details, please refer to the recent review articles on rechargeable Mg batteries, which have comprehensively summarized and discussed the cathode materials as well as the Mg anodes and electrolytes.25–32
5. Mo-based nanostructures as electrode materials for supercapacitors
It is well known that electrode materials based on an EDLC mechanism often have limited specific capacitance, usually in the range of 10–50 mF cm−2 for a real electrode surface.35,352 Since pseudocapacitance may be 10–100 times larger, supercapacitors made of redox-active electrode materials bearing pseudocapacitance are highly desirable for next-generation electrochemical energy storage applications.353 Besides charge storage in the double layer, the pseudocapacitors rely on fast and reversible surface redox reactions (faradaic reactions). The most widely used active electrode materials with pseudocapacitance are conducting polymers and transition metal oxides.353 Among the redox-active materials, Mo-based compounds, featuring high specific capacitance, low cost, natural abundance, and environmental benignity, have attracted significant interest as active electrodes for supercapacitors.
5.1 Molybdenum oxides

5.1.1 MoO2. 
MoO2 has been demonstrated as a candidate for electrochemical pseudocapacitors because of the low metallic resistivity and different oxidation state of Mo. Actually, several MoO2-based nanostructures such as MoO2 nanorods, mesoporous MoO2, and MoO2-based nanohybrids have been reported for supercapacitors.354–360 Several examples of MoO2-based electrode materials and their electrochemical properties are given in Table 2. It was reported that MoO2 not only served as an active material, but also could function as a conducting support. For example, Mai et al.357 prepared a nanostructured MoO2 thin film that was coated by Co(OH)2 nanoflakes on a 3D nickel foam scaffold by successive electrodeposition. The MoO2 thin film could serve as a conductive layer for electron transport, while Co(OH)2 nanoflakes allowed fast ion diffusion due to their large interlayer space. It was observed that the electrode made of the MoO2/Co(OH)2 nanohybrid exhibited a high capacitance of 800 F g−1 at 20 A g−1 as well as largely enhanced cyclability with only 3% capacitance loss after 5000 cycles as compared with each counterpart of MoO2 (53%) and Co(OH)2 (61%). The superior electrochemical performances of nanocomposite MoO2/Co(OH)2 electrode materials were mainly attributed to: (i) the hierarchical architecture allowing synergistic contribution of both materials with increased ion diffusion and fast electron transport; (ii) stable MoO2/Co(OH)2 interface relieving the destruction of the electrode upon charge–discharge cycling.

5.1.2 MoO3. 
As discussed above, α-MoO3 is a typical electroactive 2D layered material that can accommodate up to 1.5 Li/Mo, and comprises alternately stacked layers held together by weak van der Waals forces along [010]. As a result, α-MoO3 could be an ideal material that has the potential to deliver both redox and intercalation pseudocapacitance, thus optimizing both energy density and power density in a single material. In order to demonstrate the capacitive behaviour in such a layered structure of α-MoO3, Dunn et al.361 prepared mesoporous films through an evaporation-induced self-assembly process (Fig. 17). It was found that the capacitive charge-storage properties of mesoporous films of iso-oriented α-MoO3 were superior to those of either mesoporous amorphous materials or non-porous crystalline α-MoO3. Both crystalline and amorphous mesoporous MoO3 showed redox pseudocapacitance, but the iso-oriented layered crystalline domains enabled lithium ions to be inserted into the van der Waals gaps of the α-MoO3. Dunn et al.361 proposed that extra capacitance contribution arising from a unique intercalation pseudocapacitance would take place on the same timescale as redox pseudocapacitance. Significantly, the charge-storage capacity was unusually increased in mesoporous crystalline α-MoO3, but the charge–discharge kinetics was not scarified. Inspired by this research, researchers may come up with new ideas to develop unique pseudocapacitive materials that offer increased energy density while still maintaining their high-power-density advantages. In recent years, other nanostructures including MoO3 nanoparticles,362 nanorods,363 nanowires,364 nanoplates,365 and nanobelts,366,367 as well as ZnO/MoO3,368 polypyrrole/MoO3,369 and MWCNT/MoO3370 have been reported as electrode materials for electrochemical pseudocapacitor applications, and exhibited enhanced capacitive properties.

5.1.3 MoO3−x. 
During the past three years, MoO3−x (0 < x < 1) has been investigated as a negative electrode material that shows high specific capacitance in neutral or slightly acidic aqueous solution with high specific capacitance. Zhang's group prepared MoO3−x thin films by magnetron sputtering and core–shell Ti@MoO3−x nanorod arrays by electrodeposition.371–373 Recently, Zhou and coworkers374 reported a nanocomposite negative electrode of WO3−x/MoO3−x core@shell nanowires on carbon fabrics by physical evaporation deposition and a subsequent electrodeposition process. A flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor was assembled based on polyaniline as the positive electrode and the resulting hybrid WO3−x/MoO3−x as the negative electrode. It exhibited stable performance between 0 and 1.9 V, a high areal capacitance of about 216 mF cm−2, an energy density of 0.0019 W h cm−3, and high rate capability. This work offers the possibilities of using the WO3−x/MoO3−x nanohybrids for applications in energy storage, flexible electronics, and other consumer electronics. In another work by Zhou et al.,375 freestanding films of carbon nanotubes were used as positive electrodes, assembled with freestanding CNT/MoO3−x negative electrodes to fabricate carbon nanotube-based solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors. Such a unique device showed a high volumetric capacitance of 3.0 F cm−3, and energy and power density of 1.5 mW h cm−3 and 4.2 W cm−3, respectively. Very interestingly, a pack of supercapacitors have also been assembled in this work to drive a homemade wireless transport system successfully, demonstrating the potential of this solid-state system for future applications in the fields of portable/wearable electronics.375

5.2 Molybdates
Recently, AMoO4-type metal molybdates (A = Co, Ni, Mn, Fe, etc.) have emerged as prospective effective and scalable electrode materials for supercapacitors because of their low cost, environmental friendliness, and abundant resources. Purushothaman et al.376 synthesized α-MnMoO4 nanorods by using a sol–gel spin coating method and obtained a specific capacitance of 998, 784, and 530 F g−1 in H2SO4, para-toluene sulfonic acid, and HCl electrolytes, respectively. Kong et al.377 demonstrated a high capacitance of 326 F g−1 at 5 mA cm−2 for CoMoO4·0.9H2O nanorods prepared by a hydrothermal process. Selvan et al.378 reported that MnMoO4, CoMoO4·xH2O, and NiMoO4 based on solution-combustion synthesis provided a high specific capacitance at 5 mA cm−2 of 126, 401, and 1116 F g−1, respectively. Likewise, Wang et al.379 reported a template-free hydrothermal route for the preparation of CoMoO4 nanoplate arrays on Ni, and achieved a high specific capacitance of 1.26 F cm−2 at 4 mA cm−2 and 0.78 F cm−2 at 32 mA cm−2 with an excellent cyclability upon 4000 cycles. Hierarchical bismuth molybdate nanowires synthesized by an electrodeposition-heat method demonstrated its suitability as a negative electrode material for pseudocapacitors, showing a capacitance of 1075 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and an excellent cycle life up to 1000 cycles.380 Besides, several other nanostructures with 1D morphologies (e.g., MnMoO4 nanorods,381 NiMoO4 nanorods,382 nanowires383,384 and nanosheets,385 NiMoO4·xH2O nanorods386,387) and conducting graphene (or polyaniline)-stabilized nanohybrids (graphene/NiMoO4·nH2O,388 graphene/α-MnMoO4,389 graphene/CoMoO4,390 and polyaniline/CoMoO4·0.75H2O391) have been investigated for redox-active supercapacitors.
Recently, coupled metal molybdates have also been explored as electrode materials for supercapacitors.392–395 Coupled metal molybdates can provide an improvement in electrochemical performances due to the synergistic effect of individual metal molybdates.392,394,395 For example, Mai et al.394 reported a simple refluxing method to prepare heterostructured MnMoO4–CoMoO4 nanowires that exhibited a capacitance of 187.1 F g−1 and excellent stability (Fig. 18). This capacitance is higher than MnMoO4 (9.7 F g−1) and CoMoO4 (62.8 F g−1). Selvan and coworkers395 prepared nanosized β-NiMoO4–CoMoO4·xH2O composites by a solution-combustion method. The NiMoO4–CoMoO4·xH2O nanocomposite with a Ni:Co weight ratio of 3:1 exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 1472 F g−1 at 5 mA cm−2. Liu et al. obtained an improvement in electrochemical performance for CoMoO4–NiMoO4·xH2O bundles compared to the corresponding individual metal molybdates.393 The composite with a Ni–Co mass ratio of 1.4:0.6 took advantages of both CoMoO4 (rate capability) and NiMoO4·xH2O (high specific capacitance, 1039 F g−1). More recently, Wang et al.392 synthesized NiCo2O4 nanowire@CoMoO4 nanoplate core–shell arrays on Ni foam. With optimized preparation conditions, the hybrid material showed a high areal capacitance of 14.67 F cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2, which was several times larger than the pristine NiCo2O4 electrode (1.42 F cm−2). Despite those recent advances, the synergistic effects for the coupled electrodes of mixed metal molybdates as well as cycling stability need to be further explored. In particular, the cyclability is important for pseudocapacitive materials, where the capacity decay could be resulted from agglomeration of small nanoparticles of active materials or fractions of the active materials losing electrical contact with the current collector. Functionalized graphene sheets or carbon nanotubes may not only stabilize the nanosized active materials by hybridization but also provide a 3D conducting network for the active materials. The systems based carbon-stabilized mixed metal molybdates for high-performance pseudocapacitors are worth investigating.

5.3 Molybdenum dichalconides
MoS2 can potentially store charge by intersheet and intrasheet double-layers over individual atomic MoS2 layers and faradaic charge transfer processes due to several oxidation states of Mo.396–409 Recently, Leite and coworkers397 have demonstrated a microwave-assisted route to fabricate a MoS2–rGO hybrid with MoS2 layers covalently bonded on the surface of the rGO. Electrochemical characterization indicated that this electroactive nanocomposite could be cycled reversibly in the range of 0.25–0.8 V in 1 M HClO4 for the hybrids with low concentrations of MoS2 layers (LCMoS2/rGO), and in the range of 0.25–0.65 V for medium (MCMoS2/rGO) and high concentrations (HCMoS2/rGO) of MoS2 layers on graphene. The specific capacitance at 10 mV s−1 were 128, 265, and 148 F g−1 for the MoS2/rGO with low, medium, and high concentrations of MoS2, respectively. Ajayan et al.396 demonstrated film-based microsupercapacitors via spray painting of MoS2 nanosheets and subsequent laser patterning. It was found that the optimum MoS2-based micro-supercapacitor exhibited excellent electrochemical performance for energy storage with aqueous electrolytes, with a high area capacitance of 8 mF cm−2 (volumetric capacitance of 178 F cm−3) and excellent cyclic performance. Soon and coworkers406 proposed that MoS2 sheet arrays provided a large surface area for double-layered charge storage. Nevertheless, a low specific capacitance was obtained, probably as a result of the low conductivity of the MoS2 molybdenite phase. Since Ni3S2 is a good metallic conductor leading to ease in transportation for ions and electrons, it can be used for enhanced electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. Lin and coworkers392 have recently demonstrated a facile one-step solution method to synthesize Ni3S2@MoS2 core–shell nanoarrays directly grown on Ni foam. As expected, the as-formed Ni3S2@MoS2 heterostructured electrode exhibited about 2 times the capacitance (848 F g−1) compared to the pristine Ni3S2 sample (425 F g−1), excellent rate capability (46.6% capacity retention at 20 A g−1) and outstanding cycling stability (91% retention after 2000 cycles). Compared to MoS2, little research has been done on MoSe2 as an electroactive material for pseudocapacitors.
6. Summary and outlook
In this review article, we have attempted to chart the significant progress in nanostructured Mo-based molybdenum oxides, dichalconides, and oxysalts for rechargeable LIBs/SIBs, Mg batteries, and pseudocapacitors. The rational and creative design of unique nanoarchitectures help address the significant issues encountered during the electrochemical reactions, thus dramatically enhancing the capacity, rate capability, and cycle life of Mo-based electrodes. These developments greatly enrich Mo-based chemistry and represent promising steps towards viable energy storage devices. Moreover, a deeper and broader understanding of the Li/Na-storage mechanisms and electrochemical reaction pathways has been achieved based on several in situ and ex situ nanocharacterization techniques. While these advancements over the past decade have been impressive, a comprehensive understanding of the Mo-based chemistry is still required. The complex structural and composition evolution of Mo-based compounds with varied valence states often takes place during the electrochemical reactions, especially in the cases of nanosized domains, which makes it difficult to characterize the details of the microstructure and composition. Therefore, many details of the electrochemical mechanisms on Mo-based compounds remain controversial and unclear. It is anticipated that future investigations, especially advanced in situ nanotechnologies, would help build a thorough understanding of the reaction mechanisms and would facilitate an optimized design and engineering of nanostructured electrode materials.
Besides further improving the capacity and cyclability of the Mo-based nanostructures, another topic to explore is how to reduce irrepressible capacity, especially in the cases of nanostructured electrodes. Usually, substantial irreversible capacity occurs during the first cycle, namely, not all the charge passed on first inserting Li/Na into the electrode is extracted on subsequent Li/Na deintercalation. It is known that irreversible capacity loss is crucial to real full cells, compromising the energy density and even the effect of nanostructuring. In general, the irreversible capacity loss is mainly caused by two aspects including (i) reduction of the electrolyte on the electrode surface and (ii) the inability to remove all the Li+ (or Na+) charge that is inserted on the first discharge.17 Notably, in contrast to bulk electrodes, irreversible capacity is a more serious issue for the nanostructured materials, in which high surface area of nanomaterials prompts the surface reactions. For the currently developed nanostructured electrode materials, the initial irreversible capacity loss has not been taken seriously. By virtue of the modern analytic techniques on the atomic or molecular level, the investigation on increasing initial coulombic efficiency of nanostructured electrode materials needs to be emphasized, since it is important for the commercialization of nanostructured materials for rechargeable LIBs/SIBs, Mg batteries, and supercapacitors.
Although it is still significantly challenging on the road to viable energy storage devices based on nanostructured Mo-based materials, the great stride has been achieved during the past decade, especially the past three years. Major advances have been made in materials synthesis, enhancing electrochemical performances, unveiling the intrinsic structure–property relationships, and understanding on the charge-transport mechanism of Mo-based electrode materials for LIBs/SIBs, Mg batteries, and pseudocapacitors. It would be reasonable to believe that a further exploration in this field will lead to more exciting achievements and eventually practicability of those promising Mo-based compounds in advanced energy storage devices.
Undoubtedly, the fundamental understanding of electrode structures, the electrode/electrolyte interface, and charge-storage mechanisms is essential for future Mo-based electrochemical research. Meanwhile, the transport of electrons and ions in active electrode materials and electrolytes should be well investigated by theoretical calculations. The applications of nanotechnology in energy storage are currently in the stage of research and development. For realization of wide industrial applications of nanostructured Mo-based electrode materials in the energy-storage fields, future work is required to achieve large-scale preparation (even in low lost), improve volumetric energy density (i.e., increase the tap density), and maintain high compatibility between electrodes with electrolytes as well as device systems.
