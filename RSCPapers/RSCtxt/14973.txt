    , Accepted 3rd April 2019First published on 3rd April 2019AbstractIn this study, a fast and simple technique (2 min) has been developed to modify the pores of a novel micro-porous, amide-functionalized Co(II)-based MOF [Co(oba)2(bpfb)4](DMF)2, TMU-61, (H2oba = 4,4′-oxybis(benzoic acid) and bpfb = N,N′-bis-(4-pyridylformamide)-1,4-benzenediamine). The material produced through sulfurization of TMU-61, at ambient temperatures, can be used as an appropriate electrode material for supercapacitors (SCs). The highest specific capacitance of a system with three electrodes is 636.6 F g−1 at a current density of 5 A g−1, and the specific capacitance retention is nearly 94% after 6000 cycles, demonstrating an impressive long-term cycling stability. The asymmetric SC (ASC) based on S-TMU-61 showed the highest energy density (25.73 W h kg−1) and power density (2549.3 W kg−1). Additionally, it is observed that two S-TMU-61 ASCs connected in series are enough to supply energy for lighting blue, yellow, green and red light emitting diodes (LED) for 22 min and driving a mini rotating motor, demonstrating the excellent potential of the new material for a variety of applications. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to use post synthetic modification of a MOF with a suitable pore size to optimize the material for use in SCs.
1. Introduction
The development of advanced energy storage/conversion materials and strategies has become essential in this time of environmental and energy crises on a global scale.1,2 With everyday items such as mobile phones, portable computers and car electronics becoming more and more energy demanding as their functions improve, there is a desperate need for solutions.3,4 Supercapacitors (SCs), as one of the energy storage systems with a large power density, good reversibility and long cycle life, have attracted a large share of attention in the quest for improved energy storage and conversion materials.5–7 An outstanding electrode material must be selected to meet the requirements for enhancing energy density without sacrificing power density and cycle life.8,9
So far, there have been several different types of electrode materials under development for SCs, which can be divided into three general groups:10–12 (1) carbonaceous materials with a large surface area, (2) conducting polymers, and (3) metal oxides and their derivatives, like CuO, IrO2, MnO2, Co3O4, ZnCo2O4, MnMoO4, CoV2O6etc. The contact resistance between carbon particles of carbonaceous materials causes an internal series resistance.13 Energy storage for the latter two groups typically involves quick and reversible surface redox (faradaic) reactions while they are used as electrode materials, a process also referred to as pseudocapacitance. Unfortunately for the conducting polymers, they distend and contract during the charging/discharging procedure, which frequently causes their mechanical degradation, decreasing their electrochemical efficiencies.14,15 We propose to add, in earnest, a fourth horse to the race: metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with their high surface areas, adaptable pore size/shape and combined redox metal centers have good theoretical potential to be applied as electrode materials in SCs.16–18 After the first report of Co8-MOF-5 for SCs,19 development of methods for applying original MOFs as electrode materials has been widely studied. Lee et al.20 synthesised a Co-MOF-71 film with a specific capacitance of 206.76 F g−1 at 0.6 A g−1 in a LiOH electrolyte, with about 98.5% of its initial capacitance being retained after 1000 electrochemical cycles. Lin et al.21 prepared two MOFs with redox-active ligands for SCs; however their specific capacitances were only 23 and 22 F g−1, respectively. Their overall outcomes demonstrated poor conductivity, and it seems that the microporous nature and poor stability are an issue for these materials. Efforts to overcome these issues have been sought more fervently in recent years.
One approach is applying a conductive binder forming “bridges” to facilitate a “MOF-to-conducting binder-to-MOF” conducting mechanism: the Yaghi group reported this concept for the first time.22 In their study, they first physically combined graphene, a 2D carbon material, with original MOF particles. In the obtained materials, graphene sheets not only played a role as “bridges” between MOF particles, facilitating a “MOF-to-graphene-to-MOF” conducting mechanism, but also aided in separating the MOF particles.
Most MOFs have been restricted as precursors/templates for synthesizing porous carbons, which typically need the application of harsh pre-treatment reagents, like alkalis, and high carbonization temperatures above 800 °C.23,24 In general, MOFs can be used in three ways: (i) original MOFs; (ii) destruction of MOFs to achieve metal-oxides; and (iii) pyrolysis of MOFs to provide porous carbons. Pure MOFs have very low conductivity, which is not at all useful for SCs, whereas the second and third processes require high energy consumption and time-consuming processes, which do not get past the research lab. Also, with pyrolysis procedures, it is very difficult to control what structure is obtained.25,26 Moreover, the weak electrical conductivity of MOFs delays electron transfer between a MOF based electrode and current collectors.27,28 All this goes towards explaining why MOFs have seldom been used as electrode materials in SCs.
Besides low conductivity, the nearly exclusively microporous (<2 nm) MOFs inhibit the diffusion of electrolyte ions,29 significantly restraining their use as electrode materials for SCs, particularly at a large current density. Several investigations have indicated that a hierarchical porous structure could improve the capacitive efficiency, rate capability and cycle life of porous materials in SCs through shortening the ion diffusion distance and minimizing the diffusion resistance to transporting mass at the electrode and electrolyte interface.30 One of the reasons MOFs are attractive for many applications is that loading of a guest species can modify their properties (e.g. electrical conductivity,31 ion absorption capacity,32 and optical features33) and structure significantly. Several important uses are electric/electronic devices,34 data storage,35 electrochemistry,36 heterogeneous catalysis,37etc. Consequently, their porosity and metal cations provide an ideal environment for electrolytes and redox active sites, respectively.38–41 Metal sulfides have attracted attention in a large number of research areas, such as solar cells, Li-ion batteries, photocatalysis, and particularly SCs.42,43 In recent years, transition metal sulfides, having increased intrinsic electroconductivity, chemical resistance against alkaline electrolytes, low cost, and ecological sustainability, have been considered as building blocks in the design of energy storage/conversion materials.44,45 Metal sulfides are not stable thermodynamically in aqueous media and strongly oxidizing media used for reactions, and can be simply oxidized to the relevant metal oxides/hydroxides.46–48 Moreover, their specific capacitance is decreased and its progress to a higher level is extremely restricted as a result of their small specific surface area and electrical conductivity.49 It is proposed that introducing sulfides into MOF pores can increase the electrical conductivity and stability significantly. Therefore, it is a practical way to produce low-cost MOFs with excellent electrical conductivities to improve their electrochemical efficiencies. The presence of pores and functional groups of ligands in the MOFs can provide conditions for MOF sulfurization. Moreover, the presence of functional groups inside the MOF cavities can provide sites for molecules such as Na2S to bind as a source of sulfur, which ultimately aids diffusion of electrons through the MOF cavities.
In this work, we synthesize a new three-dimensional Co(II)-based MOF [Co(oba)2(bpfb)4](DMF)2, TMU-61, and then perform a fast in situ pore sulfurization (2 min) of TMU-61 on Ni foam at ambient temperature in a Na2S solution. Based on the results obtained, we can propose the application of S-TMU-61 as an appropriate electrode material for SCs. To the best of the authors' knowledge, related investigations have not been reported on any other MOF. This is the first report using a Na2S-loaded MOF as an electrode material for application in SCs for enhancing their effectiveness. Following pore sulfurization, the S-TMU-61 electrode demonstrates great specific capacitance, better rate capability and a longer cycling lifetime when compared with TMU-61. A maximum specific capacitance of 636.6 F g−1 was achieved for this MOF, which far exceeds that of all previous MOFs. This production approach is ecologically benign and economically feasible.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of [Co(oba)2(bpfb)4](DMF)2 (TMU-61)
The materials and instruments used in this study are presented in detail in the ESI†. Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.25 mmol, 0.073 g), H2oba (0.25 mmol, 0.063 g; 4,4′-oxybis(benzoic acid)) and bpfb (0.12 mmol, 0.038 g; N,N′-bis-(4-pyridylformamide)-1,4-benzenediamine) were added to DMF (8 mL) in a 15 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The autoclave was heated to 145 °C and kept at this temperature for 72 h. The reaction mixture was then cooled down at a rate of 3.5 °C min−1 to reach ambient temperature. The resultant TMU-61 crystals were orange in color. Yield: 0.053 g (86% based on H2oba). d.p. > 339 °C. IR data (KBr pellet, ν/cm−1): 664(m), 840(m), 1033(m), 1241(s), 1320(m), 1415(vs), 1511(s), 1556(s), 1617(s), 1661(vs), 1676(m), 2927(m), 3061(m), 3257(w) and 3351(w). Elemental analysis (%) calculated for [Co(oba)2(bpfb)4](DMF)2: C, 35.56; H, 29.42; O, 7.85; N, 8.37. Found: C, 35.13; H, 28.79; O, 7.55; N, 8.24.
2.2. Post-synthetic modification of TMU-61
TMU-61 was washed three times with deionized water and ethanol (10 mL) and then placed in a 0.3 M Na2S solution for 2 min. Following the sulfurization reaction, the resultant S-TMU-61 grown on Ni foam was rinsed three times with deionized water and ethanol, before being dried at ambient temperature under vacuum. The mass loading of Na2S is almost 30.12 mg cm−2. The color changes that occurred on washed nickel foam coated with TMU-61 or S-TMU-61 have been shown in Fig. S1.† According to the analysis carried out in this paper, Na2S molecules replace the DMF molecules in the cavities. Due to the lower electronegativity of S compared to O, replacing O with S will result in greater structural flexibility and thus easier electron transfer.
2.3. Electrode preparation and electrochemical characterization
Working electrodes were prepared as follows: the active materials (TMU-61 and S-TMU-61), acetylene black and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) solution (60 wt%) were combined at a mass ratio of 80:10:10 and added to ethanol. The resultant viscous slurry was spread onto nickel foam (1 cm × 1 cm) and then pressed under 10 MPa. These electrodes were dried under vacuum for 8 h at 60 °C. The mass of the active material was 3 mg. In order to perform ASC measurements, S-TMU-61 and activated carbon (AC) were used as the cathode and anode, respectively, and a filter paper was used to separate them.
A graphite rod and Hg/HgO electrode were applied as the counter and reference electrodes for the electrochemical measurements of a system with three electrodes. In the three electrode system, cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed. A VERSA STAT 4 potentiostat/galvanostat was used to perform CV and GCD measurements at 25 °C in 2 M KOH electrolyte for asymmetric electrochemical analyses of electrodes in the SC. EIS was carried out on a VERSASTAT 4 potentiostat/galvanostat by using an AC voltage, with a fixed 5 mV amplitude and a frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz at open circuit potential.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystal structure analysis
The reaction of Co(NO3)2·6H2O with H2oba (4,4′-oxybis(benzoic acid)) and bpfb (N,N′-bis-(4-pyridylformamide)-1,4-benzenediamine) in DMF at 115 °C gave pink crystals of TMU-61 (TMU stands for Tarbiat Modares University). The optical microscopy image of the obtained crystals is shown in Fig. S2 of the ESI.† The crystals are triclinic and belong to the P space group with lattice parameters: a = 9.8591(11) Å, b = 14.9188(15) Å, and c = 15.0675(13) Å and α = 112.424(9), β = 99.484(8), and γ = 106.304(9) (see CCDC no. 1886760 for detailed conditions) (Tables S1–S3†). Fig. 1 and S3† show that the cobalt atoms adopt a pseudo-octahedral environment surrounded by two trans nitrogen donors from the bpfb linkers and four carboxylate oxygens from three V-shaped H2oba linkers. The result of this configuration is the MOF propagating out in sheets (2-D MOFs) which do not covalently bind with one another. There is some hydrogen bonding between adjacent sheets, with the amide hydrogen (H2) interacting with one of the carboxylate oxygens (O6). There is also hydrogen bonding to the DMF molecules, which sit in the pores created by the structure. Void calculations on the structure with the DMF molecules omitted, which according to the powder patterns can be assumed to be close to the activated materials' structure, showing that 32.6% of the structure is accessible voids (based on a 1.2 Å probe radius). The cross-section of the pores is 24 × 8 Å (including the van der Waals radius), which allows TMU-61 to be considered as a microporous material. This feature is advantageous since hierarchically porous structures facilitate accessibility of the active sites for adsorption or diffusion of the reactants and products.50–53 Elemental microanalysis and single-crystal XRD analysis determined that TMU-61 has the formula of [Co(oba)2(bpfb)4](DMF)2.

The purple 5-coordinate nodes represent the cobalt centered, inorganic secondary building units (SBUs) and the yellow 3-coordinate nodes correspond to the oba linkers. The bpfb linkers are not shown as nodes as they are only 2-coordinate. The point symbol of this 3,5-c net is [42.67.8] [42.6] (d). 
3.2. Materials characterization

Fig. 2a shows field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of TMU-61, displaying its non-uniform, rod-like morphology. It is shown that there was no significant morphology alteration following Na2S loading (Fig. 2b). In other words, the main structure of this framework has been not altered following sulfurization, with the dimensions and morphology remaining unchanged. This outcome denotes that sulfurization treatment will not lead to clear morphological variations for the rod-like framework of TMU-61. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that TMU-61 could preserve thermal stability up to 345 °C, which is in accordance with activated TMU-61 (red curve) (Fig. 2c). TGA for non-activated TMU-61 (blue curve) showed a drop in weight from 50 to 155 °C related to the loss of the guest DMF molecules (18.34%, predicted: 15.84%). Additionally, the activated TMU-61 crystals showed no weight loss in the range of 50–155 °C, which proves successful elimination of the guest molecules during the activation procedure. In order to measure the specific surface area of non-activated TMU-61, activated TMU-61, and loaded S-TMU-61, their N2 adsorption isotherms were determined. The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms of TMU-61 at 77 K (Fig. 2d) corresponding to activated TMU-61 display a type IV isotherm, with a hysteresis loop at relative pressure in the range of 0.0–0.8, showing the presence of mesopores (blue curve). The porous activated TMU-61 shows a larger specific Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area (558 m2 g−1) compared to that of non-activated TMU-61 (170 m2 g−1), due to the loss of DMF molecules from the TMU-61 pores. The mesopores and corresponding large surface area of the activated TMU-61 allow better access and transport of electrolytes. In other words, creating a porous and open structure can ease the electrolyte transfer and diffusion of Na2S molecules into the pores of the MOF. Moreover, the effective loading of Na2S into the pores of activated TMU-61 can be proved using the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms: the N2 adsorption isotherms show that introducing Na2S molecules into the framework causes a reduction in the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area from 558 m2 g−1 to 86 m2 g−1 (black curve). Following the loading of Na2S into activated TMU-61, the distribution of pore size shows a slight decrease from 21.23 Å to 10.46 Å (Fig. 2d). It should be noted that the solvent free volume in S-TMU-61 (1046 Å3) is still big enough for effective mass transfer of diffusing ions for applications in SCs.

FT-IR spectroscopy is a quick method for examining the types of interactions in the structure and can greatly help us identify the type and relative strength of the bonding present. The FT-IR spectrum of TMU-61 was examined both before and after activation. As shown in Fig. 2e, all of the bonds are maintained after the DMF molecules leave and the structure of the framework has not changed. Only the peak related to the DMF molecules at around 1676 cm−1 was found to be missing after activation.54 The peaks at 1617 and 1415 cm−1 are related to the CO asymmetric and symmetric vibrations, respectively, of the carboxyl group on the H2oba linkers. The FT-IR spectra of TMU-61 prior to and following treatment with Na2S were recorded (Fig. 2e). Amide groups have two kinds of donor–acceptor affinity sites: the –NH moiety, which can play a role as an electron acceptor (Lewis acid), and the –CO group that can play a role as an electron donor (Lewis base),55 which leads to the possibility of NH⋯S and NCO⋯Na bonding, respectively. According to this figure, no change is observed in the absorption peaks, apart from a slight shift. The broad peaks at about 3400 cm−1 can be related to the stretching vibration of adsorbed water. The absorption peak at 1033 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of C–O–C and C–O bonds in the cavities.56–59
As a result of the interaction of the C–O bonds with Na+ ions, these vibrations are subject to changes, which lead to the strengthening or weakening of the corresponding bonds. This causes a chemical shift of the peak at 1033 cm−1, and a strong peak appears at 987 cm−1 after the loading of Na2S. Na+ ions can also be linked to the V-shaped linker oxygen groups of the oba species, which are directed towards the cavity. Moreover, following loading of TMU-61 with Na2S, S-TMU-61 showed an extra peak at 2450 cm−1 corresponding to the hydrogen bonding of S2− ions with N–H amide groups. In the FT-IR spectrum of TMU-61, a strong absorption peak was present at 1661 cm−1 related to the asymmetric stretching of the bpfb linker carbonyl (–CO–) group, which is significantly decreased to 1641 cm−1 in the S-TMU-61 spectrum, showing the interaction of –CO– with Na+ ions in the framework walls. In addition, the peak of the NH bending vibration, which is located at around 1556 cm−1 for TMU-61, exhibits slight broadening and a shift to 1532 cm−1 for S-TMU-61, which could be caused by weak hydrogen bonding of the group with S2−. The stability of the material in an aqueous medium was evaluated over a period of 72 hours. The FT-IR spectrum in Fig. S4† shows the stability of the material under these conditions, with no significant changes being observed.

Fig. 2f compares the XRD patterns of simulated TMU-61, the as-prepared TMU-61, activated TMU-61, and TMU-61 loaded with Na2S molecules. Based on this figure, the positions of diffraction peaks of the as-prepared TMU-61 are similar to those of the simulation based on TMU-61 single-crystal data (CCDC 1886760†), showing high purity. Moreover, the diffraction pattern of activated TMU-61 exhibits similar peak positions to TMU-61 prior to activation, demonstrating that the structure does not collapse upon solvent removal. No new diffraction peaks were observed following immersion in Na2S solution, which confirms that the lattice structure of the MOF is not altered by this guest. Still, the diffraction peak intensities are weaker compared to that of TMU-61, representing that the sulfurization only takes place in the TMU-61 pores and does not destroy the framework structure. Furthermore, the XRD patterns of the TMU-61 specimens activated at different temperatures (Fig. S5†) confirm structural integrity of this material at 350 °C. Moreover, based on the PXRD patterns shown in Fig. S6,† crystallinity of TMU-61 was not changed by immersing it in acetonitrile, water, absolute ethanol and n-hexane chemical solvents for three days, demonstrating reasonable chemical stability.
Elemental mapping of S-TMU-61 shows that Co, C, N, O, Na and S elements are consistently distributed throughout the whole structure (Fig. 3). As shown in these figures, Na and S elements are observed at a much lower concentration, due to the fact that these elements are inside the cavities and are observed with less intensity in elemental mapping. The results of this analysis are in good agreement with the results of BET, FT-IR and XRD analyses. Also, TMU-61 elemental mapping is shown in Fig. S7.†

The S2− ion leaching experiment was performed using ICP analysis. It was observed that less than 3.5% of the S2− ions pass from the frameworks into the reaction mixture during 24 hours, meaning that more than 96% of the S2− ions stay in the framework under the reaction conditions. These analyses verify the stability of the loaded framework under reaction conditions appropriate for SCs.
3.3. Electrochemical properties

3.3.1. Electrochemical performance in a three-electrode system. 
To reveal their potential use in SCs, we examined the electrochemical efficiency of TMU-61 and S-TMU-61 arrays on nickel foam in a three electrode system with 2 M KOH as the electrolyte. Fig. 4a displays the usual CV curves corresponding to TMU-61 and S-TMU-61 arrays on nickel foam in the potential window from 0 to 0.5 V (vs. SCE) at 25 mV s−1 scan rate. Clearly, the shape of the CV curves shows a pair of redox peaks during the cathodic and anodic sweeps, which is apparently distinct from the EDLCs characterized by nearly rectangular CV curves. This shows that the capacity of TMU-61 and S-TMU-61 resulted from the faradaic redox reactions. This figure shows the bigger CV integral region of S-TMU-61 than TMU-61. This outcome shows that pore sulfurization of TMU-61 can increase the electrochemically active surface area, and result in improved supercapacitive activity. Fig. 4b displays the CV curves of S-TMU-61 at different scan rates between 5 and 30 mV s−1. The shapes of CV curves at diverse scan rates indicated nearly no alteration. The current of the anodic peak increases and the current of the cathodic peak decreases with increasing the scan rates, representing a relatively poor resistance of the electrode and quick redox reactions at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte.
 Fig. 4  (a) CV curves of TMU-61, S-TMU-61, and Ni foam at 25 mV s−1 scan rate, (b) CV curves of S-TMU-61 at different scan rates, (c) GCD curves of TMU-61 and S-TMU-61 electrode materials at a current density of 5 A g−1 and (d) GCD curves of S-TMU-61 at different current densities. 
It is well known that GCD measurement is a precise technique for approximating the specific capacitance of pseudocapacitors, which can be calculated from the following equation: (1)where I (A), Δt (s), ΔV (V), and m (g) refer to the current during the discharge procedure, the time of discharge, the potential window, and the mass of the active materials, respectively. Fig. 4c shows a comparison of the GCD curves, in a potential window of 0–0.5 V, for the TMU-61 and S-TMU-61 electrodes at a constant current density of 5 A g−1. The calculated specific capacitance of TMU-61 and S-TMU-61 at a 5 A g−1 current density is 330 and 636.6 F g−1, respectively. Fig. 4d shows specific capacitance versus applied current density for S-TMU-61. Based on the GCD curves in this figure, the values of specific capacitance are 636.6, 490, 446, 400, 370, and 362 F g−1 at current densities of 5, 7, 10, 12, 15 and 18 A g−1, respectively. In general, as the current density increases, the specific capacitance decreases slowly. This can be described by the diffusion impact restraining the diffusion and migration rate of electrolyte OH− ions inside the electrode at high values of current density.60 As for the capacitance contribution of conductive substrates, the electrochemical efficiency of nickel foam has been studied (Fig. 5). We believe that the capacitance contribution of nickel foam is negligible. The increased specific capacitance of S-TMU-61 in this study is remarkable compared to that of similar materials in the literature (Table 1).61–72

Rate capability is a main factor for power use, a factor which shows the retention of specific capacitance at increased current densities. It must be noted that S-TMU-61 retained 56.86% of its initial capacity after increasing the current density from 5 to 18 A g−1, suggesting excellent rate capability (Fig. 6a). The drop in specific capacitance with increasing current density may be due to this fact that more active materials are not involved in the fast redox reaction with an increase in current density. Cycling stability is another important factor for SC application. Consequently, we evaluated the long-term cyclic stability of S-TMU-61 by repeating GCD curves at a current density of 7 A g−1 for 6000 cycles. The electrode indicated excellent cycling efficiency, with 94% of the first specific capacitance being retained after 6000 cycles. Moreover, the coulombic efficiency stays at 98% throughout. Fig. 6b represents the long-term cycling stability and the coulombic efficiency of the S-TMU-61 electrode. Fig. 6b shows the first 3 cycles corresponding to representative voltage profiles for S-TMU-61 from GCD measurements carried out at a constant current density of 7 A g−1.

We conducted characterization experiments such as XRD and FT-IR spectroscopy to analyse the stability of S-TMU-61 during cycling, in order to investigate S-TMU-61 following the cycling measurements (Fig. S8†). After 6000 cycles, the key diffraction peaks of S-TMU-61 were well preserved; however, the crystallinity of the material is damaged and it is shown in Fig. S8a.† This figure indicates that during cycling the structure of S-TMU-61 is still preserved. Moreover, Fig. S8b† represents the FT-IR spectra of the S-TMU-61 sample after cycling. The spectra of S-TMU-61 before and after cycling exhibited almost similar peak locations. This also further demonstrates the structural stability of S-TMU-61 in an alkaline solution after cycling. Based on the above XRD and FT-IR results, it can be concluded that during cycling the crystalline structure of S-TMU-61 was not altered.
Electrode resistance was determined using EIS measurements. As observed in Fig. 7, the Nyquist plot shows a partial semicircle in the high frequency area and a straight line in the low frequency area. The sharp slope of the straight line corresponding to S-TMU-61 in the low frequency area demonstrates a relatively small ionic diffusion resistance from the electrolyte to the electrode. The partial semicircle has a small diameter in the large frequency area for S-TMU-61, representing a small charge transfer resistance. Such results are in close accordance with earlier outcomes, which proved that the existence of Na2S in the TMU-61 pores can increase electrical conductivity and offer good capacitance retention. The inset in Fig. 7 displays an equivalent circuit, where Rs is the reflected solution resistance, Rct is the reflected charge-transfer resistance, W is the resistance associated with ion diffusion/transport from the electrolyte to the electrode surface and CPE is the constant phase element of a double-layer capacitor.

3.3.2. Electrochemical performance in a two-electrode system. 
In order to further study the capacitive efficiency of the S-TMU-61 electrode for practical use, an ASC was fabricated using S-TMU-61 and AC as the positive and negative electrode materials (Fig. 8a), and is labeled S-TMU-61//AC. Charge balance theory (q+ = q−) was used to achieve the maximum range for the ASC working potential window. The required voltammetric charges (Q) were computed using: Q = Csingle × ΔV × m(2)where Csingle (F g−1) is the specific capacitance for all electrodes recorded with a three-electrode cell, ΔV (V) refers to the potential window and m (g) represents the corresponding electrode mass. It is worth noting that the Csingle value was calculated from CV at a 20 mV s−1 scan rate. Following calculation of the charges, the mass ratio of the ASC negative (m−) and positive (m+) electrodes was measured, and this ratio should follow eqn (3) to keep a suitable charge balance between the two electrodes. (3)
 Fig. 8  (a) Schematic illustration of the designed ASC and (b) CV curves of the S-TMU-61 and activated carbon electrodes at 20 mV s−1 scan rate as positive and negative electrodes, respectively in a three electrode system in 2 M KOH electrolyte. 
With respect to the specific capacitance and the ΔV values for the two electrodes, the optimal m+/m− ratio should be 0.25, in a developed ASC. In this study, 4 and 1 mg of active materials were used as the negative and positive electrodes, respectively, which sum up to 5 mg cm−2. Fig. 8b shows the CV curves of the individual S-TMU-61 and AC electrodes at 20 mV s−1 scan rate. Based on Fig. 8b, the ΔV values for the AC and S-TMU-61 electrodes are in the range of −1.2 to 0 V and 0–0.5 V, respectively. The negative electrode shows an almost rectangular CV curve without a redox band, which shows a typical EDLC activity, whereas the positive electrode shows a redox-based pseudocapacitance activity. The overall voltage for the ASC can be taken into account as the sum of the potential ranges of its two electrodes. Accordingly, the overall potential corresponding to the cell can be as large as 1.7 V, in a 2 M KOH electrolyte.
Such a large potential window of the synthesized device was additionally proved by CV and GCD analyses under different potential windows, as demonstrated in Fig. 9a and b. As expected, the CV and GCD curves demonstrate a steady electrochemical potential window of 1.7 V, at a fixed scan rate of 20 mV s−1 and a current density of 5 A g−1. Fig. 9c demonstrates the CV curves of S-TMU-61//AC at different scan rates of 5–100 mV s−1 at potentials ranging from 0 to 1.7 V. Evidently, all the CV curves indicated a collective hybrid of EDLC and faradaic redox activity. Fig. 9d represents the GCD curves of S-TMU-61//AC with a fixed cell voltage of 1.7 V at current densities in the range of 5–15 A g−1. An obvious symmetry can be observed in the charge and discharge curves at the highest cell voltage of 1.7 V. This proves the ability of the SC to provide significant capacitance and electrochemical reversibility.

As observed in Fig. 9d, the specific capacitances of the S-TMU-61//AC ASC at current densities of 5, 7, 9, 12 and 15 A g−1 are 64.1, 49.41, 37.05, 35.29 and 33.52 F g−1, respectively. Additionally, the fabricated device indicated good rate efficiency, with 52.3% of the specific capacity being retained when the current density increased from 5 A g−1 to 15 A g−1. Power density and energy density are two main factors affecting the effectiveness of electrochemical SCs. The relationship between these two parameters is described by the Ragone plot for the device, as shown in Fig. 10a. The energy density (E) and power density (P) were calculated using the following equations: (4) (5)
 Fig. 10  (a) Ragone plot and (b) cycling stability and coulombic efficiency of the S-TMU-61 electrode material. 
In these equations, V (V) refers to the operating voltage window (V), Δt (s) represents the discharge duration and C (F g−1) refers to the specific capacitance of the electrode material. The fabricated device stores the highest energy density of 25.73 W h kg−1 and transfers a power density of 2549.3 W kg−1. The energy density reduced from 25.73 to 13.45 W h kg−1; however the power density increased from 849.8 to 2549.3 W kg−1 at a current density of 5–15 A g−1. These values are greater than those in recently reported research.74–78 As long-term cycling stability is another important factor for SC electrode materials, the fabricated S-TMU-61//AC ASC was exposed to 6000 GCD cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1. Fig. 10b shows the capacitance retention of the prepared S-TMU-61//AC ASC as a function of the number of cycles. The S-TMU-61//AC ASC cell retains 91.8% of its capacitance following 6000 cycles representing its good electrochemical stability. In addition, from the GCD curves, shown in the inset of Fig. 10b, it can be observed that the curves of the S-TMU-61//AC ASC have a symmetric shape – indicating excellent long-term electrochemical stability. The reversibility of asymmetric devices was also studied through measurement of the coulombic efficiency using eqn (6), where tD (s) and tC (s) refer to the period of the discharging and charging procedures, respectively. The cycle stability of electrode materials and electrochemical devices can be determined by comparing the η values corresponding to the first and last cycles. The asymmetric device shows a high coulombic efficiency of 98% for 6000 cycles, which displays its larger degree of reversibility (Fig. 10b). To assess the applicability of this device, two series-connected devices were charged for 30 s, and they successfully powered blue, yellow, green and red LEDs and drove a mini rotating motor as shown in Fig. 11. (6)
 Fig. 11  LED lighting and driving mini rotating motor using two series-connected devices. 
According to the above electrochemical data, S-TMU-61 has a significantly better efficiency than TMU-61. According to the above observations, it is concluded that the increased supercapacitive features of the prepared S-TMU-61 can be assigned to existence of Na2S within MOF pores as well as excellent conductivity, and transport rate for both electrolyte ions and electrons via formation of a conduction path that offers better supercapacitive performance. In other words, Na2S shows quick electron transfer, good charge-transfer kinetics and so, a dramatic increase in the capacitive efficiency. As the electrochemical reaction mostly takes place on the surface of electrode materials, the surface sulfurization of TMU-61 pores and their electrochemical efficiency for storing energy in SCs are very fascinating. All the outcomes of electrochemistry prove that a quick and mild pore sulfurization reaction provides well-defined S-TMU-61 to examine the relationship between its structure, chemistry and supercapacitive efficiencies.
Here, the question is about the mechanism for storing charges in the electrode material. Energy storage in SCs takes place through various mechanisms. According to these mechanisms, three SC categories are introduced. Electrical double layer capacitors are superconductors where charge storage takes place through adsorption of electrolyte ions on the surface of electrode materials and redox reactions do not occur. These properties are detected using rectangular cyclic voltammograms and the linear dependence of potential changes on time at a constant current. In the second category of SCs where battery-like electrodes save the energy, faradaic peaks are observed in cyclic voltammetric diagrams in which the potential difference between the oxidation peaks and reduction peaks is about 0.1 to 0.2 V, and two phases are observed in their galvanostatic charge–discharge diagrams. In the third group, pseudocapacitors, redox peaks are also found in the cyclic voltammetric diagrams, indicating a lower potential difference between the oxidation and reduction peaks.79,80 Recently, oxides, carbides, and nitrides have been considered as the electrode materials in this category. Based on the provided description and the results obtained in the present work, the electrode material in this work is categorized as a battery-like class with the faradaic charge storage mechanism.

4. Conclusions
This study on S-TMU-61 presents a facile, fast and efficient pore sulfurization approach to prepare a high-performance MOF for SCs. In a three electrode system, the S-TMU-61 electrode material shows more specific capacitance and better cycling stability in 2 M KOH electrolyte than any other MOF to date. A specific capacitance of 636.6 F g−1 was obtained for the S-TMU-61 electrode at 5 A g−1 in 2 M KOH. Moreover, 94% of the initial capacitance is retained after 6000 cycles. A new S-TMU-61//AC ASC, fabricated using the S-TMU-61 electrode as the cathode and an activated carbon electrode as the anode, shows a high cell voltage of 1.7 V, a high energy density of 25.73 W h kg−1 and a power density of 2549.3 W kg−1. Two cells of the S-TMU-61//AC ASC were used to light blue, green, yellow and red LED indicators for 22 min and drive a mini rotating motor indicating its potential for a myriad of practical applications. Consequently, the outcomes show that introduction of S2− ions into the microporous TMU-61 successfully changes the specific capacitance of this material, and can resolve the issue of lower electrical conductivity of MOFs. The large efficiency and electrical activity of S-TMU-61 are assigned to its overall beneficial structural and electronic properties, resulting from pore sulfurization: the resulting structure is extremely conductive, exhibits little Na2S release under reaction conditions, can be consistently dispersed on Ni foam, and shows increased reactivity at the active sites. Thus, S-TMU-61 is a potential electrode material for SCs, because of its good electrochemical efficiency. This study opens a new path for developing advanced electrode materials for use in SCs with no pyrolysis and calcination required. Additional studies in the field of MOFs as electrode materials are ongoing in our laboratory.
