1. Introduction
Incorporation of lanthanide ions (Ln) into TiO2 nanomaterials has been proved to be an efficient strategy to explore new functional materials. The photocatalytic activity of the Ln–TiO2 materials can be improved by increasing the optical absorption, stabilizing the anatase phase and decreasing the electron–hole recombination.1 In addition to enhancing the photocatalytic activity, recent studies have demonstrated that lanthanide-doped TiO2 can also be used as smart photoactive materials to enhance the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells2 and to explore fluorescent labeling materials for effective multiplex assay.3 On the other hand, lanthanide–titanium oxo-clusters (LnTOCs) or lanthanide–polyoxotitanates (LnPOTs) have recently been receiving great attention, because they can act as model compounds helping to understand the varied bonding structures of Ln ions in TiO2 materials and the energy transition between lanthanide ions and the TiO matrix.4 They can also act as a single molecule source for the fabrication of nanomaterials and film materials of Ln-doped titanium oxide.5 Similar to the lanthanide-doped TiO2 materials, LnTOCs can also be used as effective catalysts for water splitting6 and as luminescent materials.7
In the past few years, TOCs have been largely developed for syntheses and applications.8 Nevertheless, only a few LnTOCs have been reported. Except syntheses and crystal structure characterization,9 studies on their potential applications have been scarce up to now.4–7 Herein, we report the syntheses and crystal structures of three LnTOCs formulated as [Ln2Ti6O2(C2O4)4(NO3)2(OiPr)20]·2HOiPr (Ln = La (1), Ce (2) and Eu (3)). In these three compounds not only Ln ion but also oxalate were introduced into the LnTOCs. Oxalate, the simplest and cheapest binary carboxylic acid, has been used as an activating component for the photoredox catalysis and degradation of organic pollutants,10 and has also been utilized for the assembly of lanthanide metal–organic frameworks (LnMOFs)11 and lanthanide coordination polymers12 due to its high affinity to Ln. However, based on our knowledge, no LnTOC with oxalate has been documented.
Recently, TOCs have been used as photocatalytic materials under ambient conditions and even in water systems. In most cases, they were already not the original clusters due to their sensitivity to moisture. However, less work on the degradation clusters was discussed.13 In this paper, the degradation products were carefully characterized. Using the degradation Ln–TiO–C2O4 materials, the photocurrent response and photocatalytic dye degradation were examined. The improvements in the photocurrent intensity of the Ln–TiO–C2O4 electrodes and the photocatalytic activity for dye-degradation are attributed to the cooperative effect of lanthanide and oxalate doping in TiO catalysis. We also find that the CeTOC-doped electrode exhibited the most excellent photocurrent response and effective photodegradation ability for amaranth dye.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and physical measurements
All pure reagents of analytical grade were commercially purchased and used without further purification. TOC [Ti7(μ3-O)4(OEt)20] (Ti7) was prepared as reported previously.14 Elemental analyses of C, H and N were performed on a VARIDEL III elemental analyzer. The infrared spectra were recorded using single crystals on a HYPERION 2000 microscopic IR spectrometer. Solid-state room-temperature optical diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrometer. Room-temperature X-ray diffraction data were collected using a D/MAX-3C diffractometer using a Cu tube source (Cu-Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å). The morphologies and EDS analysis (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) of the samples were obtained using a JSM-5600LV scan electron microscope. Thermal analysis was conducted using a TGA-DCS 6300 microanalyzer. The samples were heated under a nitrogen stream of 100 mL min−1 at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1.
2.2 Syntheses of compounds

[La2Ti6O2(C2O4)4(NO3)2(OiPr)20]·2HOiPr (1). 
Analytically pure Ti(OiPr)4 (0.1 mL, 0.33 mmol), La(NO3)3·6H2O (15 mg, 0.02 mmol) and oxalate (24 mg, 0.02 mmol) were mixed in 0.3 mL of anhydrous isopropanol. The mixture in a thick glass tube was quickly degassed by nitrogen. The sealed tube was heated at 50 °C for 3 days, and then cooled gradually to room temperature to yield colorless crystals (49% yield based on Ti). The crystals were rinsed with isopropanol and preserved in a sealed glass tube. Anal. calcd for C74H156La2N2O46Ti6 (MW 2375.03): C, 37.42; H, 6.62; N, 1.18%. Found: C, 37.52; H, 6.42; N, 1.33%.

Anal. calcd for C74H156Eu2N2O46Ti6 (MW 2401.15): C, 37.02; H, 6.55; N, 1.17%. Found: C, 36.81; H, 6.33; N, 1.40%.

2.3 X-ray crystallographic study
The measurements of 1 and 2 were carried out using an Agilent micro focus single-crystal diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å) at 293 K. The structures were solved by direct methods using the SHELXS-2014/2016 program15 and the refinements were performed against F2 with SHELXL-2014/2016.16 All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms were not dealt with. Detailed crystal data and structural refinement parameters for 1 and 2 are listed in Table S1 in the ESI.† The measurement of 3 was carried out on a Bruker APEX-II CCD diffractometer at 120 K. Although the structure was solved, the data were not satisfactory to be published.
2.4 Photocurrent and photocatalytic experiments
The photocurrent experiments were performed on a CHI650 electrochemistry workstation in a three-electrode system, the microcrystal samples were mixed with Nafion-D521 (Alfa) and coated directly on a cleaned ITO electrode (50 Ω per square cm), which was used as the working electrode. A Pt plate and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the auxiliary electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The working electrodes were positioned 20 cm from the light source with an effective irradiation area of 0.5 cm2. An aqueous solution of Na2SO4 (0.1 mmol L−1, 100 mL) in a quartz cell was used as the supporting electrolyte. A commercial amaranth dye was used in the photocatalytic experiment and the initial concentration of the dye solution was 10 mg L−1. A high pressure mercury lamp (250 W) served as the light source and was positioned 20 cm over the reaction cell. To 100 mL of the dye solution, 20 mg of powdered samples were dispersed in and the suspension was magnetically stirred under dark conditions for 30 min to reach the adsorption–desorption equilibrium. A water jacket was applied to maintain room temperature. During the photoreaction, 3 mL aliquots of the solution were collected at intervals of 10 min for analysis. A control experiment was performed without catalyst. The concentration of amaranth was determined using a UV-vis spectrophotometer at 520 nm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structures
Compounds 1–3 were prepared directly by one-step in situ low-heat synthesis in anhydrous isopropanol. They are isomorphous in the formula [Ln2Ti6O2(C2O4)4(NO3)2(OiPr)20]·2HOiPr, Ln = La (1), Ce (2) and Eu (3). Single-crystal X-ray analysis shows that they have a [Ln2Ti6O2(C2O4)4(NO3)2] cluster core. Only the structure of 1 is discussed here to illustrate the structural features of the three compounds (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1, ESI†). The cluster is constructed of two Ti3O13 subunits and a centered La2O14 subunit and they are further assembled from four C2O42− ions to form a sandwiched structure. Two Ti(IV) atoms in the Ti3O13 subunit take the distorted octahedral geometry (green in Fig. 1b) while the other Ti(IV) adopted a trigonal bipyramid geometry (cyan in Fig. 1b). The three TiO polyhedra are edge-shared with a μ3-oxo unit to form the Ti3O13 subunit. The La atom takes a nine-coordinated geometry with a chelated nitrate anion and the two LnO9 units are edge-shared together to form the La2O14 subunit. The oxalate ligands acting as bridges adopted two distinct modes when bridging the La(III) and Ti(IV) ions in complexes: one is the normal μ2-κ1:κ1:κ1:κ1 type (type I) and the other is the μ2-κ1:κ1:κ1:κ2 type (type II)12b (Fig. 1c). The C2O42− planes of different types are almost perpendicular to each other with a dihedral angle of 82.9°. The main body of the [La2Ti6O2(C2O4)4(NO3)2] core is surrounded by 20 OiPr groups with bridged or non-bridged coordination modes, which easily undergo dealkoxy reactions, leading to the instability of the compounds. The stability of TOCs varied tremendously from stable to very unstable. In this case the crystals are very unstable in comparison with most of the reported TOCs.8

3.2 Studies of dealkoxy reactions
Numerous TOCs have been reported and now they have been used as materials or precursors for catalysis and photoelectroactive materials even in water systems. However, some of them are unstable under ambient conditions and only a few of them are stable as they are stabilized by other ligands, such as catechols.17 It is unbelievable that less research on the degradation and the degradation materials has been discussed,13 which might be due to the complication of the degradation reactions. We tried to deal with this phenomenon found in these clusters. Crystals 1–3 are unstable when they were isolated from the solvent. Fig. 2a shows the XRD results of the isolated samples after different times, along with the simulated spectra from the data obtained from X-ray single-crystal analysis. Comparing the XRD spectra, we can find that the low angle peaks of the crystals lost gradually after the crystals were isolated. However, the degradation samples, denoted as 1′–3′, are rather stable, which gave the identical spectra (Fig. 2b). In single-crystal X-ray diffraction, the crystal mounting and sealing using glue must be very quickly, otherwise the cocrystallized solvent molecules will lose. The quickly measured IR of the single crystals and the IR of the aged samples are quite different (Fig. 2c and Fig. S2, ESI†). As a result, the strong absorption bands at around 1680 cm−1 and 1312 cm−1 can be assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the oxalate group.12a,18 The absorption band at 1362 cm−1 corresponds to the vibration of the nitrate anion by comparing with the IR spectra of Ln2(C2O4)3, which is broadened after degradation (Fig. S3, ESI†). Isopropoxy groups are detected by the νC–H (between 2980 and 2850 cm−1) and νTi–O–C (1018 cm−1) vibrations,19 and these peaks disappeared for the aged samples 1′–3′. The Ti–O vibrations (around 800 cm−1) of the aged sample become broad and intensive in comparison with that of the just isolated one. The solid-state UV-vis spectra of 1′–3′ in eV are presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The thermal decomposition of 2 was studied (Fig. 2d) which shows multistep decomposition in the range of 25 to 900 °C. The compound is unstable even at room temperature, which gradually loses the isopropyl groups until 280 °C. Two OiPr groups lose an iPr–O–iPr and leave an O atom bonded to titanium. In the second step, beginning at 280 °C and ending at 680 °C, the mass loss 15.0% (calculated 15.9%) corresponds to the decomposition of four oxalate groups leaving four oxygen atoms to balance the charge. The third step removes the nitrate anions from 700 °C to 900 °C leaving two oxygen atoms (6.1%, calculated 6.0%). The results of thermal gravimetric analysis, IR spectra and XRD were in agreement with the conclusion that the clusters are unstable and quickly lose the OiPr groups and reconstruct to form a [Ln2Ti6O11(C2O4)4(NO3)2] polymer. The elemental microanalysis based on EDS confirms the atomic ratios (Fig. S5, ESI†). These so-called crystals were subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis (Fig. 3). Fig. 3a–c show the micrographs of crystals 1–3. The dense crackles showed that the crystals were easy to degrade even just on isolation from the solvent. Fig. 3d and f show the morphologies of the 2 day-aged crystals 2 and 3. The crystals change to fused microparticle structures. The structures are beneficial for application in electrodes and catalysis. As discussed above, we started from the LnTOC crystals and finally obtained the microparticle catalytic materials with the most probable composition [Ln2Ti6O11(C2O4)4(NO3)2]n (Ln–TiO–C2O4). It should be the first time to characterize the degradation TOCs.

3.3 Photocurrent response properties
The degradation crystals of 1–3 are Ln–TiO–C2O4 micro particle materials (1′–3′) and indeed most of the TOC materials used in applications are such degradation materials, which should have advanced properties as photoelectrode and catalytic materials. The photocurrent response properties of 1′–3′ were examined using a three-electrode cell in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution (see the Experimental section). Fig. 4a shows the results along with those of an undoped Ti7 cluster, [Ti7O4(OEt)20],14 and a sample of 2′ (Ce) after being treated at 500 °C in 2 h. The electrodes were irradiated on and off using a xenon light source (150 W) at fixed time intervals. The photocurrent reaches the maximum quickly without delay and is basically constant in intensity during the measurement time. Under the same experimental conditions, repeated measurements show that the photocurrent densities of 1′–3′ were in the order of 2′ ≫ 1′ ≈ 3′ (1.2, 0.6, and 0.6 μA cm−2). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of 1′–3′ in the same 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution was performed. As shown in Fig. 4b, samples 1′ and 3′ are silent in the potential window range 0.00–1.40 V, and only the 2′ (Ce) showed a redox wave centered at 0.9 V due to the redox reaction of Ce(IV)/Ce(III), which contributes to the highest photocurrent densities of 2′.20 We have demonstrated that TOCs doped with redox active transition metal ions generally exhibited a higher current density.17,21 Under the same experimental conditions, the photocurrent densities of 1′–3′ are significantly larger than that of a basic Ti7 TOC (non-doped and no oxalate coordinated) and a 500 °C treated sample of 2′ (oxalate decomposed), indicating that both Ln doping and oxalate coordination improve the photocurrent activity. The data also showed the advantage of doping with redox active metal ions.

3.3 Photocatalytic dye degradation
It is known that most organic azo-dyes, such as amaranth, are hazardous to the environment and human beings. The prolonged intake of amaranth can cause tumors, allergies, respiratory problems, and birth defects in the human body. Photocatalytic dye degradation using TiO2 has emerged as one of the most promising routes for the removal of amaranth from water bodies.22 The photocatalytic ability of the aged samples of 1′–3′ and Ti7 was evaluated by the photocatalytic degradation of amaranth under UV light illumination (see the Experimental section). As shown in Fig. 5a, after 40 min illumination, the residual concentrations in percentages were 25.5, 31.0 and 15.0% for 1′–3′, which exhibited much higher UV light photocatalytic activity compared with that of Ti7, which should be ascribed to the doping of Ln3+ and oxalate. Among these photocatalysts, 2′ exhibited the most excellent photocatalytic ability, which is in accordance with their photocurrent behaviors discussed above. The excellent redox property of Ce(III) is the key factor for the higher photocurrent and photocatalytic activities of 2′.23 In order to further study the effects of the doped Ln ion and oxalate, the photocatalysis of the deoxalate sample of 2′ (calcined at 500 °C) and the oxalate were also evaluated under the same catalytic conditions. The corresponding curves are plotted in Fig. 5b and about 35% and 55% of the dye were photodegraded, respectively. Comparing with the percentage of Ti7, both the doped Ln ion and oxalate can promote the photocatalytic activity of the TiO material, but the oxalate was more effective in the catalytic reaction. The kinetic analysis data of the photocatalytic reactions of 2′ are plotted in Fig. 5c. The curves were fitted by the apparent first-order rate equation: −ln(C0/Ct) = kt, where C0 is the initial concentration of the dye, Ct is the concentration at time t, and k is the kinetic constant. The linear transform results showed the degradation of dye accords with the pseudo first-order kinetics. The corresponding kinetic constants (k) and regression coefficients (R2) were calculated and are given in the figure.

(b) Comparing the remaining concentrations using 2′, Ti7, and 2′ after being treated at 500 °C and oxalate. (c) Linear fits to the logarithmic ratio of concentrations (C0 = 10 mg L−1). (d) A proposed cooperative effect of Ln and oxalate promoted the photocatalytic degradation of the dye. 
During photocatalysis, the absorption of photons by the TiO photocatalyst causes the excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, thus generating electron–hole pairs (e−/h+). The presence of lanthanide ions with partially filled d or f-orbital can effectively trap the electron in the conduction band and significantly reduce the recombination with holes in the valence band,1a,24 which are advantageous and useful in the photodegradation of the dyes. On the other hand, oxalate can be oxidized by the reaction with a hole giving rise to a radical oxalate and to yield carbon dioxide and a CO2˙− radical. The CO2˙− and oxalate radicals react with molecular oxygen in water yielding superoxide and hydroperoxyl radicals (O2˙−/HO2˙−). The O2˙−/HO2˙− radicals are key intermediates because of their strong oxidizing power, which degrades the organic dyes.10b Based on these photocatalytic mechanisms and our experiments, a proposed cooperative effect of Ln(III) and oxalate promoted the photocatalytic degradation of the amaranth dye and is presented in Fig. 5d, where the oxalate as a sacrificial component plays a role in improving the photocatalytic performance of titanium dioxide.
4. Conclusion
In summary, three isostructured LnTOCs (Ln2Ti6, here Ln = La, Ce and Eu) were synthesized and characterized crystallographically. The cluster features two Ti3O13 subunits and a central La2O14 subunit bridged by four oxalate ions. The main body of the cluster is coordinated around by 20 OiPr groups, which easily undergo dealkylation. The degradation clusters were carefully characterized and were found to be the fused microparticle material with the most probable composition [Ln2Ti6O11(C2O4)4(NO3)2]. The photoelectrochemical properties of the materials were examined and the results showed the enhancement in photocurrent density because of the lanthanide metal doping of the TiO electrodes and oxalate aiding in the electron transfer process. Photocatalytic dye degradation using the degradation material was also evaluated. A cooperative effect of lanthanide and oxalate doping for the degradation of amaranth dye was first reported. These materials are a kind of unique catalyst with Ln–TiO–C2O4 multifunctional components and the oxalate anion plays an important role in the dye degradation.
