    , Accepted 20th January 2019First published on 1st February 2019AbstractConjugated polymers in thin films tend to orient their backbones with respect to substrates through self-assembly when processed from a solution. The molecular packing orientation and crystallinity of polymer crystals have been found to play a critical role in terms of their electrical performance. Taking advantage of the shorter bond length and the smaller rotation energy of the CH2–O bond than those of the CH2–CH2 bond in an alkyl chain, a side-chain engineering strategy is reported, which involves sequential oxygen-substitution of the carbon atoms from the γ position outwards along the hexyls in regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (RR-P3HT). The subtle disparity between the CH2–O and CH2–CH2 bonds is found to enable fine tuning of the solid-state organization of the corresponding RR-P3HT analogues, namely poly(3-(2-propoxyethyl)thiophene) (P3POET), poly(3-(3-ethoxypropyl)thiophene) (P3EOPT) and poly(3-(4-methoxybutyl)thiophene) (P3MOBT). The evolution of film microstructures is observed when doping with FeCl3 in nitromethane at room temperature, and so is their thermoelectric performance. The highest power factor of 19 μW m−1 K−2 was observed for the doped P3POET film, which presents a dominant edge-on orientation with the strongest crystallinity and the closest π–π stacking. At the doping time corresponding to the optimized power factors (PFs) for each polymer, the doped P3POET film maintains both relatively high Seebeck coefficient (S) and electrical conductivity (σ) close to their maximum values, while the other polymers show either higher S and much lower σ (P3HT) or higher σ but much lower S (P3EOPT and P3MOBT). The square dependence of the PFs on S together with higher σ amplifies the power factor value of P3POET, which is almost 2 times those of the other polymers (11–13 μW m−1 K−2).
1. Introduction
Owing to their tunable optoelectronic properties, thermal stability and mechanical flexibility, conjugated polymers have been actively employed in the field of organic electronics using various cost-effective solution-processing techniques.1–6 Such tunability has been continually witnessed by manipulating their chemical structures and physicochemical properties in conjunction with device parameters towards the expected performance output. Deep understanding of the fundamental structure–property–performance correlations has therefore been significantly advanced over the past few years.4,7–11 The know-how could also be readily applied in materials design and fabrication of lightweight, flexible and low-cost organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). Thus, introducing conjugated polymers into thermoelectric applications at moderate temperatures has attracted increasing attention in recent years.12–17 The thermal-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency for a given semiconducting material is generally evaluated using its dimensionless figure of merit defined as ZT = S2σT/κ, where S (V K−1) is the Seebeck coefficient, σ (S m−1) is the electrical conductivity, T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, and κ (W m−1 K−1) is the thermal conductivity.18 The Seebeck coefficient is directly related to the density of states. The electrical conductivity is expressed as σ = nqμ, where n (cm−3) is the carrier density, q is the carrier charge, and μ (cm2 V−1 s−1) is the carrier mobility. The combined contribution from the lattice (κL) and electron (κE) to heat transport constitutes the overall thermal conductivity. The product of S2σ is defined as the power factor (PF), usually specified in μW m−1 K−2 and indicative of the electrical power that can be generated by a thermoelectric material. What is most exasperating is the strong adverse interdependence among S, σ, and κ, which imposes restrictions on how large ZT can be achieved. In particular, as n increases, the increasing σ and κ are accompanied by a decreasing S.18 Optimizing ZT thus stands as a grand challenge. Considerable efforts have been devoted towards the structure design and/or processing of materials so as to decouple the interdependence among the parameters S, σ, and κ by manipulating phonons and electrons at the nanoscale to enhance the ZT value.13,19 On the other hand, although the thermal conductivity of organic semiconductors is much lower (0.1–1 W m−1 K−1) compared to that of their inorganic counterparts,20–24 it is quite challenging to be measured, especially in the in-plane direction. Moreover, the thermal conductivity of organic semiconductors, including polymers, is mostly closer to that of a phonon glass.18 Consequently, it is the PF that is usually determined instead of the ZT to assess the thermoelectric competency of semiconducting polymers.
Conjugated polymer paradigms within various organic electronic applications have been reiterating the critical role of molecular ordering and orientation as a controlling factor to achieve desired organization for high-performance.25–34 Specifically, edge-on oriented crystalline lamellae could be more favorable for efficient in-plane charge transport as desired in organic field effect transistors, whereas face-on oriented lamellae could facilitate out-of-plane charge transport as desired in polymer solar cells. Since the charge transport proceeds predominantly within the lamellae (either along the π–π stacking direction or along the polymer backbones), in some cases, an intermixing of edge-on oriented crystalline lamellae and face-on oriented crystalline lamellae could even reduce the transport anisotropy, leading to a higher charge transport in specific directions. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) has become a powerful tool for the microstructure characterization of polymers in film.35–37 The importance of film microstructures has also been demonstrated in recent reports on polymer thermoelectric properties.38,39 For example, besides introducing charge carriers that may form polarons or bipolarons and perhaps even a mixture of the two, the electrical transport properties also depend on the structural organization of semiconducting polymers, spanning the regime from the molecular scale to the macroscale in the solid state.40 However, given the fact that the optimal solid-state ordering of conjugated polymers within a specific device application can only be realized by trial and error, and is largely materials dependent, the task of directly attaining desired solid-state ordering is quite challenging. The introduction of charge carriers within OTE devices has been unexceptionally implemented by electrical doping on organic materials so far. There is no doubt that choosing the right dopant and doping method (by vapor or solution) is critical for the control of film morphology.21 From a molecular engineering point of view, the conjugated backbone and side chains (offering the solubility for processing) of a conjugated polymer have a significant impact on the molecular ordering and orientations in thin films. Janáky et al. studied the effect of the side chain length on the supramolecular structure and the electrical properties.41 Bazan et al. studied the effect of counterion species at the side chains and the side chain length on the conductivity and thermopower of self-doped conjugated polyelectrolytes.42 How molecular engineering on conjugated backbone and/or side chain could play a role in affecting the electronic structure and film microstructure of OTE polymers involved in thermoelectric conversion still remains beyond reach. To realize the potential of semiconducting polymers for thermoelectrics, the relationship between the chemical structure, morphology, and the resulting thermoelectric performance needs to be comprehensively understood.
In this contribution, we elucidate the evolution of molecular packing and thermoelectric properties of p-doped regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (RR-P3HT) analogues by engineering the side hexyl chains as shown in Chart 1. RR-P3HT has evolved as a benchmark polymer for OTE research as well as PEDOT:PSS due to its ready availability and tendency to form ordered lamellar structures in films by interchain stacking.41,43–49 Herein, sequential oxygen substitution of the carbon atoms along the side hexyl chains was rationally adopted to fine-tune the intermolecular interactions of the polymers and to explore their effects on the material physicochemical properties, film microstructures, and OTE performance. Commercial RR-P3HT was also employed as a reference to prompt such investigations. It has been found that the energy barrier of the rotation of the O–CH2 bonds (E = 0.08 eV) is slightly smaller than that of the CH2–CH2 bonds (E = 0.11 eV) in an alkyl chain. Meanwhile, the length of the CH2–O σ bond (1.42 Å) is a little bit shorter than that of the CH2–CH2 σ bond (1.54 Å).50–52 Such fine disparities could render the singly O-substituted chains more flexible without transforming their aliphatic property relative to the hexyl. A fine evolution of polymer film microstructures could be expected when an oxygen atom is substituted for a carbon atom outwards along the side hexyl chains within P3HT. To observe the effect of sequential O-substitution along the side chain on the OTE properties, the conventional oxidation doping method involving soaking of polymer films in FeCl3 solution in nitromethane for varied time durations was used to make them electrically conducting for OTE measurements at room temperature. Thus, this work has focused more on the effect of side chain engineering on the solid-state ordering and OTE performance than on the doping method. Indeed, the evolution of aggregated microstructures is observed accordingly in response to such side chain engineering. When immersion-doped with FeCl3 in nitromethane at an optimized concentration at room temperature, the film microstructures evolved in comparison to that of their corresponding undoped films. Moreover, the characteristics of charge carriers in the polymer films vary with increasing doping time, and so do the parameters S, σ and PF.

2.3 Polymer films for thermoelectric performance measurements
Glass substrates with a size of 2 cm × 2 cm were sonicated in acetone, isopropanol, ethanol and deionized water sequentially and washed with the corresponding solvent and dried under a flow of nitrogen. The substrates were then transferred to a UVOCS ultra-violet ozone cleaning system and exposed to UV-ozone for 10 min prior to use. The polymers were dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) with a concentration of 30 mg mL−1. Then the polymer films were spin-coated on the glass substrates at 1000 rpm for 1 min and dried naturally under ambient conditions to obtain a film thickness of around ∼200 ± 40 nm. Anhydrous FeCl3 was dissolved in nitromethane at a concentration of 0.01 M. The polymer films were then immersed in FeCl3 solutions for certain periods of time, rinsed in nitromethane, and subsequently dried under an air flow before being transferred instantly to a ULVAC-RIKO ZEM-3 measurement system (Ulvac, Japan) at ambient temperature under a helium atmosphere. The air humidity was controlled at 30–40%.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization of the P3HT analogues
The molecular structures of all P3HT analogues and their synthetic routes are depicted in Scheme 1. The standard procedure of the Rieke polymerization method was employed to prepare the polymers due to its strong capability of affording high regioregularity of P3HT with desired Mn and low PDI values.57–59 The molecular weights of the polymers determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) were found to be in the range of 7.2–13.2 kg mol−1 with the PDIs in the range of 1.2–1.5 except around 2.13 for P3BOMT. 1H-NMR spectroscopy analysis of the polymers provided unequivocal evidence for the introduction of oxygen atoms at the specific positions along the side chain. The regioregularity of the polymers is typically calculated by comparing the integrated peaks corresponding to the α-methylene protons to those of the thiophene unit on the side chains in the head-to-tail (HT) versus head-to-head (HH) linkages. In particular, δ 4.42 for P3BOMT, δ 2.85 for P3POET, δ 2.65 for P3EOPT, δ 2.59 for P3MOBT, and δ 2.56 for P3HT were determined (Fig. S1–S5, ESI†). This gives 70%, 96%, 95%, 97%, and 95% HT percentage for P3BOMT, P3POET, P3EOPT, P3MOBT, and P3HT respectively. The much lower regioregularity (70%) and higher PDI value of P3BOMT relative to those of the other polymers could be ascribed to the more unbalanced reactivity of the 2- and 5-positions of the thiophene unit caused by the electron-withdrawing oxygen atom at the β position, which probably increases the content of non-HT linkages in the polymer. The strength of such an electron-withdrawing inductive effect of the strong electronegative oxygen atom on the thiophene units becomes weaker and weaker when the oxygen atom moves beyond the β position. Much higher HT regioregularities and uniform PDIs were reasonably achieved for the other three polymers, which are comparable to that of commercial P3HT. The decomposition temperatures Td of the polymers were determined by observing 5% weight loss, which are 296, 330, 369, 404, and 450 °C for P3BOMT, P3POET, P3EOPT, P3MOBT and P3HT, respectively (Fig. S6, ESI†).

3.2 Melting and crystallization behaviors
The effects of sequential oxygen substitution along the alky side chain from the β to ω position on the melting and crystallization behaviors of the P3HT analogues were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. The heating and cooling thermograms of the second cycle of the polymers are presented in Fig. S7 (ESI†). For P3BOMT, no melting and crystallization peak can be clearly detected, which could be ascribed to its much lower HT regioregularity of around 70%. In the heating cycle, P3HT showed the highest peak melting temperature (Tm) of 222 °C, which is in great agreement with the reported Tm values.60 The peak Tm values of P3POET, P3EOPT, and P3MOBT were determined to be 177, 200, and 211 °C, respectively, apparently indicating a progressively increasing trend when the oxygen atom moves towards the end of the side chain. The second cooling scans indicate apparent propensity of crystallization for the polymers P3POET, P3EOPT, P3MOBT, and P3HT. A similar shift of the crystallization temperatures (Tc) towards higher temperatures can be observed as well. The peak Tc values of P3POET, P3EOPT, P3MOBT, and P3HT were found to increase from 117, 148, 174 to 187 °C. A broad crystallization process can be noticed for P3POET. Although P3BOMT does not present obvious melting and crystallization behavior, the increasing trends in the Tm and Tc values indicate that the thermal properties of P3HT can be effectively controlled by engineering the position of the O atom located at the side chain, suggesting the existence of varied intermolecular interactions among the polymers in the solid state (Fig. 1).

3.3 Optical and electrochemical properties
The solution (1.0 × 10−5 g mL−1 in chlorobenzene) and thin-film UV-vis absorption spectra of all polymers at room temperature are depicted in Fig. 2. In diluted chlorobenzene solution, all the polymers show a single absorption band with a slightly varied maximum wavelength (λmax,sol) of around 456 nm as tabulated in Table 1, which originates from the π–π* transitions on the conjugated backbones. The extinction coefficients (εsol) of these bands range from 2.5 × 104 to 3.5 × 104 mL cm−1 g−1, as compiled in Table 1. When going from solution to the thin film state, the peak corresponding to the π–π* transitions is red-shifted around 58 nm for P3POET, P3EOPT, P3MOBT and P3HT, respectively, while it is red-shifted only around 25 nm for P3BOMT. It should be noted that the formation of vibronic shoulders at the lower energy area can be obviously observed for all the polymers except for P3BOMT. This is especially in the case of P3POET with the O atom located at the γ position in the side chain, implying an increased intermolecular interaction and ordering in the film over the others. The maximum wavelengths of the films (λmax,film) and the corresponding absorption coefficients (εfilm) are presented in Table 1 as well. In addition, except for P3BOMT with an optical bandgap (Eg) of 2.11 eV, the other four polymers exhibit similar band gaps of around Eg = 1.92 eV.

The electrochemical properties were further investigated by cyclic voltammetry to determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of all the polymers (Fig. S8, ESI†). Irreversible oxidative responses were observed. The HOMO energy levels (EHOMO) of −5.36, −5.24, −5.15, −5.10, and −5.21 eV were calculated from the oxidation onset potentials (Eonsetox) as presented in Table 1 for P3BOMT, P3POET, P3EOPT, P3MOBT and P3HT, respectively. The O-substituted polymers roughly exhibit a tendency to be more easily oxidized when the O atom moves from the β to ω position along the side chain. This can be well explained by the electron-withdrawing inductive effect of the O atom. When the O atom moves outwards from the β to ω position, its electron-withdrawing inductive effect decreases. The conjugated backbone becomes relatively more electron-rich and tends to be more easily oxidized to offer a lower Eonsetox. The apparent effect of such side chain engineering on the redox properties of the resulting conjugated polymers has seldom been observed. The LUMO energy levels of the polymers were estimated to range from −3.2 to −3.3 eV according to the equation ELUMO = (EHOMO + Eg).
With much lower regioregularity, the UV-vis absorption spectra of P3BOMT both in solution and in film differ greatly from those of the others. Moreover, the HOMO level of P3BOMT is much deeper due to the existence of the electron-withdrawing inductive effect of the β oxygen atom on the conjugated backbone. In order to objectively explore the effect of oxygen substitution on the solid-state ordering and thermoelectric performance, P3BOMT is therefore excluded from the other P3HT analogues from the following investigations. On the other hand, a variation of the molecular weight was also noticed among P3POET, P3EOPT, P3MOBT and P3HT with comparable regioregularities. Effective conjugation length (nECL) is an important point from which further extension of the conjugated chain does not affect a certain property any more, for example, the maximum absorption wavelength and the band gap in the solid state. For polythiophenes, the effective conjugation length was proven to be 20–22 monomers.61,62 Here, the effective conjugation length is around 42 monomers for P3POET with the lowest Mn, which is quite enough for the saturation of the photophysical properties. As can be observed from the absorption spectra depicted in Fig. 2, the maximum absorption wavelengths of P3POET, P3EOPT, P3MOBT and P3HT both in solution and in film are consistent with each other. The effect of molecular weight was therefore not taken into consideration for the study on solid state ordering and OTE properties below.
3.4 Solid state ordering of neutral polymers
Powder X-ray diffraction measurements were performed to gain insight into the structural ordering of the pure polymers in the solid state. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), a diffraction peak at a 2θ value of 5.30, 5.60, 5.78 and 5.85° can be observed for P3HT, P3POET, P3EOPT and P3MOBT, respectively, corresponding to a distance value (d) of 16.66 Å, 15.77 Å, 15.28 Å, and 15.10 Å, respectively, determined using the interchain stacking of the corresponding side chains. It is obvious that the stacking between the side chains becomes more compact from P3HT and P3POET to P3MOBT. A diffraction peak at a 2θ value of around 24.08° can be noticed for P3POET, corresponding to a typical backbone π–π stacking distance of 3.69 Å. A similar diffraction peak at a 2θ value of around 23.41° with a relatively larger π–π stacking distance of 3.80 Å can be observed for the other three polymers as well. Moreover, P3POET shows relatively high and sharp peaks compared to P3HT, indicating its better crystallinity than the other polymers with O-substitution in the side chains. Grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was employed as well to probe the molecular packing in the polymer films in the neutral state and the polymer orientations of the crystalline lamellae with respect to the silicon substrate. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), all polymer films exhibit preferable edge-on orientated molecular packing. Lamellar diffractions in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction determined using the side chain interactions can be observed at a qz of around 0.39, 0.40, 0.42 and 0.43 Å−1 (d = 16.10, 15.70, 14.95 and 14.60 Å accordingly) accompanied with a π–π stacking peak in the in-plane (IP) direction at a qr of around 1.68, 1.70, 1.64 and 1.64 Å−1 (d = 3.74, 3.69, 3.83 and 3.83 Å accordingly) for P3HT, P3POET, P3EOPT and P3MOBT respectively, which is in excellent agreement with the powder XRD results. The lamellar stacking distance shrinks while the π–π stacking distance expands upon substituting the carbon atoms from the γ to ω position with the O atom. Interestingly, P3POET almost displays the longest edge-on oriented lamellar stacking distance and the shortest π–π stacking distance among all the O-substituted polymers. The evolution of the lamellar stacking distance of the polymer films is directly correlated with the location of the O atom in the side alkyl chains with the corresponding ending propoxyl, ethyoxyl and methoxyl groups. Siegel et al. once reported more favourable sandwich π–π stacking of aryl rings with electron-withdrawing substituents reducing the electron density of the aryl rings.63 In this work, the existence of the γ-positioned O atom leads to a relatively more electron-deficient conjugated backbone for P3POET. The closer π–π stacking that existed in the P3POET film could be explained similarly in comparison with the other two O-containing polymers. Moreover, the crystallinity of edge-on oriented P3POET is overwhelmingly higher than the crystallinity of any other O-substituted polymers, even that of P3HT, which agrees well with the film absorption feature as indicated in Fig. 2. From the in-plane GIWAXS profiles shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), partial face-on orientation can be noticed for the polymers except P3MOBT without obviously detectable coexistence of face-on orientated crystals. Moreover, the face-on orientated lamellar stacking peak of P3POET is much weaker and broader than those of P3EOPT and P3HT, suggesting much inferior polymer crystallinity in this orientation.
3.5 Thermoelectric properties
To evaluate the thermoelectric properties of the films of these P3HT analogues with such O-substitution on the side chains, the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient were measured in a He-filled chamber with the four-probe configuration at room temperature. The films were doped by immersing them in the oxidant solutions of FeCl3 in nitromethane at varied concentrations over various doping time prior to the measurements. The optimized concentration of the FeCl3 solution was found to be 0.01 mol L−1, which resulted in easily measurable electrical conductivities for all the polymers (Table S1, ESI†). Polarons and bipolarons have been proposed as the dominant charge carriers in a conjugated polymer at a certain doping level. Electronic transitions associated with positive polarons and bipolarons appear below the band edge of the polymer in the visible, near-infrared (NIR), and even middle infrared regions (MIR), which can be experimentally distinguished by the number of strong absorption bands.64,65 In particular, a polaron exhibits a strong two-band feature while a bipolaron exhibits a strong one-band feature at a longer wavelength. Due to the difficulty of determining the charge carrier density, it would be very helpful to consider how the absorption of the neutral polymer films evolves upon doping. Thus, before the discussion of the thermoelectric properties of the respective doped polymer films, optical absorption spectroscopy was utilized to determine the nature of the charge carriers in the films with different doping levels obtained by immersing them in a 0.01 mol L−1 solution of FeCl3 in nitromethane for different time durations (Fig. 3). For the P3POET film, the π–π* transition in the neutral film at 520 nm is found to continuously decrease with the prolonged doping time, and is accompanied by a simultaneous appearance of absorption bands at 780 nm (1.82 eV) and above 1500 nm. The absorption intensity of the band at 780 nm reaches the maximum after doping for 2 min. A slight decrease of the absorption at 780 nm and a continuous increase above 1500 nm can be then observed after further doping, leading to the formation of two isosbestic points at around 630 and 930 nm, indicating the formation of positive bipolarons from positive polarons after doping for 2 min. P3EOPT presents a doping time dependent absorption feature with two-band absorption and a single isosbestic point at around 620 nm, indicating that only polarons formed within 60 min. P3MOBT exhibits a similar doping-induced two-band absorption feature to that of the P3POET film with two isosbestic points, while the formation of bipolarons starts after doping for 20 min. The time dependent doping absorption spectrum of the P3HT film was also recorded as a reference. A similar two-band absorption feature to that of P3POET was observed including two isosbestic points at 620 and 910 nm, and the formation of bipolarons started after doping for 2 min. Briefly, only positive polarons formed after doping for 60 min for the P3EOPT film, whereas positive bipolarons started to form from positive polarons after doping P3POET and P3HT for 2 min and P3MOBT for 20 min.
 Fig. 3  UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the polymer films doped at various doping levels by immersing the films in a 0.01 mol L−1 solution of FeCl3 in nitromethane at r.t. over different times. 
Raman spectroscopy analysis was also carried out to investigate the effect of FeCl3 doping on the structure characteristics of the polymer films. Raman spectra of the films excited at 514 nm were obtained before and after doping for within 30 min as presented in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The bands at ∼1380 cm−1 (Cβ–Cβ stretching vibration) and at ∼1450 cm−1 (CαCβ stretching vibration) are observed for the P3POET, P3EOPT, P3MOBT, and P3HT films in the neutral state.66,67 Doping treatment has an unremarkable effect on the position of the Raman bands, but makes the CαCβ stretching vibrations broader. The P3POET, P3MOBT and P3HT films present a slight shift of the CαCβ stretching vibration towards a higher frequency, revealing the transition of the conjugated chains from the benzoid to quinoid structure as the doping proceeds.68,69 Such transitions suggest the appearance of bipolarons in agreement with the corresponding doping time dependent UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra.
The thermoelectric parameters, σ, S, and PF, of all the polymer films with different levels of doping are depicted in Fig. 4. For these polymer films, the electrical conductivities initially increase, to reach the maxima, and then decrease as the doping time increases. The doping time corresponding to the highest electrical conductivity varies from polymer to polymer. The P3HT film presents its highest electrical conductivity of 246.1 S cm−1 after immersion for 10 min, at which time both polarons and bipolarons exist in the P3HT film. For the P3POET and P3MOBT films, the highest electrical conductivity of 193.5 and 223.1 S cm−1, respectively, was attained after immersion in the oxidizing solution for 40 seconds, with the charge carrier in the form of polarons. The P3EOPT film exhibits the highest electrical conductivity of 250 S cm−1 after immersion for 2 min, with polarons as the only charge carrier. The Seebeck coefficient of the P3HT film presents a continuously decreasing magnitude right from the beginning, while the other three films exhibit an initial increase in the Seebeck coefficient, reach a maximum, and then decrease as the doping time increases. The largest Seebeck coefficients are determined to be 34.0, 22.3, 26.3 and 61.5 μV K−1 for doping times of 120, 120, 120 and 20 seconds for P3POET, P3EOPT, P3MOBT, and P3HT, respectively. Interestingly, relatively high S values can only be attained in the early doping state, for immersion times of less than 10 min for all the polymers.
 Fig. 4  Electrical conductivities (in orange color) and Seebeck coefficients (in gray color) of (a) P3HT, (b) P3POET, (c) P3EOPT and (d) P3MOBT. Critical points of the doping time resulting in the initial formation of positive bipolarons from positive polarons are represented by the dotted cyan lines. 
Despite the differences in the electrical conductivities and Seebeck coefficients among all the polymers, the integrated response of the electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient to the doping time leads to an increase of the power factors that reach their own maxima before decreasing at longer immersion times (Fig. 5). Due to the fact that the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity of the P3POET film are both high at low doping levels, the PF of the film reached almost a factor of two higher value of 19 μW m−1 K−2 after doping for 40 seconds than that of any other film. For the P3EOPT and P3MOBT films, the maximum PF values were around 12.5 and 11.5 μW m−1 K−2, respectively. The reference P3HT film exhibited a maximum PF of around 11.7 μW m−1 K−2. It is worthwhile to note that all these maximum PF values were obtained in a state of doping characterized by the dominance of polarons.

3.6 Solid state ordering of the doped polymer films with the optimized PFs
GIWAXS measurements were performed again as indicated in Fig. 6 to examine the changes in the local molecular organization of the films doped analogously by immersion in a solution of FeCl3 in nitromethane over the time that gave the optimized PFs, namely 40 seconds for P3POET and P3MOBT, and 2 min for P3HT and P3EOPT. All the doped polymers formed semi-crystalline films with a strong texture. The scattering patterns were broadened slightly and the conformation of the preferentially edge-on orientated crystalline lamellae remained upon doping. The OOP (100) lamellae distances (∼16.10 Å) became very close for all the polymers except for P3MOBT (∼15.32 Å), while the IP (010) π–π stacking distances were almost similar (∼3.81 Å), except for P3POET (∼3.71 Å, remaining the shortest). Meanwhile, the crystallinity of the OOP (100) lamellae diffractions was improved greatly for doped P3MOBT and P3POET, which were much weaker in their undoped form. A significant change is that the crystallinity of the face-on oriented crystalline lamellae was strengthened for P3EOPT, P3MOBT and P3HT compared with their undoped films (Fig. S10, ESI†), with the obvious appearance of OOP (010) diffractions at a qz of around 1.65 Å−1 (with d space ∼3.81 Å) corresponding to the vertical π–π stacking. Evolution of the film structure with varied doping levels has been observed in quite a few solution doping examples due to the incorporation of counterions from the dopants, depending on the chemical structure of the materials and the doping level.38,70,71 Overall, the changes of the in-plane scattering features are quite similar in the P3EOPT, P3MOBT and P3HT polymer films, but not in P3POET, which shows the strongest crystallinity of the edge-on orientated crystal lamellae (out-of-plane scattering) after immersion doping for 40 seconds. Moreover, the crystallinity of the face-on orientated crystal lamellae (in-plane scattering) of P3POET was the weakest with barely detectable OOP (010) π–π stacking diffraction. It seems that the local structure order of the P3POET film was not disturbed much after doping for 40 seconds. Meanwhile, doping with FeCl3 makes the molecular packing in the three polymer films, P3EOPT, P3MOBT and P3HT, comparable and eliminates the differences observed in their molecular packing states when undoped. Practically, the maximum electrical conductivities for all the polymers are fairly close and in the range of 200–250 S cm−1 although they were achieved at different doping times. The attainable similar highest electrical conductivities of all the films could be attributed to their retention of the preferred edge-on orientation, which facilitates the in-plane charge transport after doping at a certain level. However, at the immersion doping time corresponding to the maximum PF for each polymer, only the doped P3POET film maintains both S and σ relatively high and close to the maximum values, while the other polymers exhibit either high S but much lower σ (P3HT) or high σ but much lower S (P3EOPT and P3MOBT) as shown in Fig. 4. The square dependence of the PF on S together with higher σ amplifies the difference of the PF of P3POET from those of the other polymers. The dominant edge-on orientation with stronger crystallinity and closer edge-on oriented π–π stacking might be responsible for the higher integrated PF observed in this polymer at an appropriate doping level.

4. Conclusions
Due to the existence of the shorter bond length and the smaller rotation energy of the CH2–O bond than those of the CH2–CH2 bond, sequential O-substitution of the carbon atoms from the γ position outwards along the hexyl side chains of RR-P3HT to the ω position led to the increase of the melting and crystallization temperatures of the resultant polymers. The neutral polymer films feature a decreased edge-on oriented lamellar stacking distance and an increased π–π stacking distance. UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of polarons and/or the combination of polarons with bipolarons, which was found by probing their characteristic absorptions upon increasing the immersion-doping time in a FeCl3 solution in nitromethane at room temperature. The similar highest electrical conductivities of all the doped films were attained. The morphology studies of the polymer films with the optimized doping time corresponding to the maximum PFs revealed that all the polymers favored the formation of edge-on orientated molecular packing with respect to the substrate. Moreover, the polymer with the γ O-substitution exhibited the largest proportion and the strongest crystallinity of the edge-on oriented lamellae with the closest π–π stacking. The attractive molecular packing state of the polymer enabled the maintenance of both S and σ close to their maximum values, resulting in the optimized PF almost two times of the polymers with O-substitution on the δ and ω positions with high σ unfavorably coupled with lower S. Although how σ coupled with S responds to polymer film morphology evolution is not clear, this research successfully demonstrates a facile strategy of fine-tuning the solid-state organization and polymer thermoelectric properties via side-chain engineering of semiconducting polymers by sequential oxygen-substitution of the carbon atoms. This attractive approach could assist in establishing the guidance for further structure optimization toward high performance polymer-based thermoelectric materials.
