    , Accepted 17th July 2014First published on 17th July 2014AbstractFour new alternating copolymers of naphthodifuran and quinoxaline have been developed. With the bandgap as low as 1.2 eV, polymers exhibited extended absorption to 1200 nm. Their potential in bulk heterojunction solar cells was evaluated. With device optimization, triazoloquinoxaline based polymers contributed the highest power conversion efficiency of 0.84%.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn considerable attention in the field of renewable energy technologies, mainly due to their potential in the mass-production of low cost, light-weight and large-area flexible devices.1–3 PSCs with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture are of particular interest.4 Significant progress has been achieved in pursuing high-performance BHJ devices, with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 9%.5–8 Great efforts have been made in new material development (e.g. narrow bandgap polymers5,6 and fullerene derivatives7) and device engineering (e.g. tandem,8 inverted9 and ternary10 structure design, as well as annealing, solvent processing and interfacial modifications).11 However, the PCEs obtained from small-area devices are still far from commercialization.9 Therefore low bandgap conjugated polymers have emerged and drawn particular interest due to their distinct advantages, such as broad absorption and photoresponse extended from the ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) to 1 μm near-infrared (NIR) region, as well as cost-effective solution processing procedures of large-area and flexible devices.10 Some research groups demonstrated that if we assumed that a transparent electrode had a transmittance of 85%, from the standard spectrum of solar irradiation (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2), the response extended to 1 μm, and the theoretical maximum of the short circuit current density could be increased to ∼31.9 mA cm−2 of the PSC device.11 These theoretical calculations deduced that the broad absorption strongly affect PSC device performance, especially Jsc. As has been shown, the highest PCE based on the presented μm NIR conjugated polymers reached 6%.12 These NIR low bandgap polymers have huge potential to structure tandem PSC devices combined with effective moderate band gap polymers.
For the development of donor-alternating-acceptor (D–A) narrow bandgap polymer donors, the matching of D and A is a great concern in structure design.13–15 Recently, we have synthesized a series of copolymers based on benzodithiophene (BDT) and benzotriazole16 or benzothiadiazole quinoxaline17 for PSCs. Further enhancing electron donor unit push ability, naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]difuran (NDF)18–21 instead of BDT, which is similar to naphthodithiophene.22,23 By fusing two furan units on both sides of a naphthalene unit, an extended π-conjugation system is constructed to form a highly rigid coplanar backbone. This structure provides strong intermolecular π-overlapping and electron-donating properties to enhance charge separation, transport, and energy-level tunability. NDF based small molecules showed marvellous hole mobilities of 3.6 cm2 V−1 s−1.18 These remarkable properties have enabled NDF-based PSCs to achieve PCEs of ∼5%.19–21 However, comparative study based on different strong electron-accepting units (such as triazoloquinoxaline or thiadiazoloquinoxaline) copolymers have never been reported. Further correlation studies on the structure of NDF alternating polymers with different acceptor units and their physiochemical properties might offer some helpful insight into designing new narrow bandgap polymers.
In this study, four narrow bandgap copolymers by alternating NDF and benzotriazole or benzothiadiazole quinoxaline units were designed and prepared for the first time. The correlation studies of the quinoxaline accepting unit structure with the optical, electronic properties and photovoltaic performance of the resulted polymers (see Scheme 2) were presented. BHJ devices were optimized with thermal annealing and processing solutions. The best device delivered a maximum PCE of 0.84%, with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.44 V, a close circuit current (Jsc) of 3.31 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 57.7%.
2. Experimental part
2.1. Characterization and instrumentation
All starting materials and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Acros and used without further purification. THF, toluene and diethyl ether was dried over sodium/benzophenone and freshly distilled before use. Chloroform and dichloromethane were distilled from CaH2 under nitrogen.
The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were collected on a Bruker AVANCE 500 MHz (Bio-Spin Corporation, Europe) spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra were measured with a Perkin Elmer Lambda 900 UV-VIS-NIR absorption spectrometer. The gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements were performed on a Waters 717–2410 with polystyrenes as the reference standard and THF as an eluent. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a TA instrument TGA/SDTA851e under nitrogen at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was performed on a DSC instrument DSC823. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted on CHI660D electrochemistry workstation in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 with the polymer film on a Pt plate, a Pt slice, and the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the working electrode, the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively.
2.2. Device fabrication
BHJ solar devices were fabricated with a general structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (50 nm)/polymer:PC61BM/LiF (0.6 nm)/Al (100 nm). Firstly, ITO glass substrates were cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent-water, acetone, deionized water and isopropyl alcohol. Secondly, the organic residue was further wiped off in UV-ozone for 20 min. Thirdly, a thin film of PEDOT:PSS (∼50 nm) was spin-coated on ITO substrates and dried at 150 °C for 10 min. Then, blends of polymers and PC61BM with different ratios were dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene, chlorobenzene or chloroform, and the solutions were filtered through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter. Certain volume of DIO was added as a processing additive to the blend solutions when needed. The active layer were spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer for 40 s. Then sequentially, 0.6 nm of LiF (0.1 Å s−1) and 100 nm Al (2 Å s−1) were thermally evaporated on the active layer at a pressure of 1.0 × 10−6 m bar through a shadow mask (active area 7.25 mm2). Lastly, the current density–voltage characteristics of the polymer solar cells were measured by using a Keithley 2400 (I–V) digital source meter under a simulated AM 1.5 G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). The light intensity was calibrated by a certified Oriel Reference Cell (91150V) and verified with a NREL calibrated Hamamatsu S1787-04 diode.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and thermal stability
The synthetic route for NDF ditin monomer is shown in Scheme 1 using a direct four-step procedure.19,20,24 Fused benzotriazole and benzothiadiazole monomers were synthesized according to our previous reports.16,17 The targeted copolymers PNDF-BTzQx (P1), PNDF-BTzBPz (P2), PNDF-DTBTQx (P3) and PNDF-DTBTBPz (P4) were prepared via Stille coupling reaction between NDF tin reagent 4 and brominated compound 5, compound 6, compound 7, compound 8, respectively, with a yield of 59–96%. Both 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra for all polymers are provided as Fig. S2–S12 in ESI.† The as-prepared polymers possess a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 5.1–25.1 kDa, and a corresponding polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.25–2.43 (Table 1). Considering the large repetition units of four polymers, we can see that only P3 underwent sufficient polymerization to afford a Mw of 60.9 kDa. The high thermal stability of these polymers was crucial for their application in organic electronics.25 The thermal stability of four polymers was characterized by TGA (Fig. 1), with the corresponding data listed in Table 1. All polymers exhibited good thermal stability under nitrogen with 5% weight loss decomposition temperatures (Td) at 409, 420, 400 and 385 °C for P1, P2, P3 and P4, respectively.

3.2. Optical properties
The UV-vis-NIR spectra of copolymers in both CHCl3 solutions and thin films are shown in Fig. 2, with data listed in Table 1. All polymer films exhibit two main absorption bands, the first absorption band at the shorter wavelength (350–650 nm) is attributed to the π–π* transition of the main chain, with the second band at the longer wavelength (550–1000 nm) owing to the intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction between donor and acceptor units in polymers backbones. Polymer P1–P4 films show a λmax at 775, 786, 952 and 950 nm, respectively, which is 48, 34, 32 and 78 nm red-shifted than their solutions. Among them, the benzothiadiazole quinoxaline based polymers P3 and P4 show an extended absorption to near-infrared region (beyond 1000 nm) (Fig. 2).

3.3. Electrochemical properties
Using the absorption onset of solid film (λedge), the optical bandgap (Eoptg) of P1–P4 was estimated to be 1.31, 1.23, 1.18, 1.13 eV, respectively. The onset potential for oxidation (Eonsetox) was observed to be 0.87, 0.80, 087 and 0.82 V for P1–P4, respectively [Fig. 3(a) and (b)]. Accordingly, the corresponding HOMO energy level of P1–P4 was calculated to be −5.27, −5.20, −5.27 and −5.22 eV, respectively. With Eoptg and HOMO energy level at hand, the LUMO energy level of P1–P4 was thus calculated to be −3.96, −3.97, −4.09 and −4.00 eV, respectively.26 The HOMO–LUMO energy diagrams of P1–P4 are compared in Fig. 3(c), together with that of PC61BM.

Theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) methods were performed for P1–P4 at the Becke's three-parameter gradient-corrected functional (B3LYP)/6-31G level with the GAUSSIAN09 program. For P1–P4, the fragment containing two NDF units and two acceptor units was used as the model. To simplify the calculations, long alkyl or alkoxy side chains were replaced by methyl or methoxy. The optimized structures with the calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels are shown in Fig. 4. For P1–P4, the HOMO level is mainly distributed on the NDF unit (electron donor), while the LUMO level on the benzotriazole or benzothiadiazole quinoxaline (electron acceptor). It was indicated that P1–P4 is the typical D–A copolymers. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of P1, P2, P3 and P4 were calculated to be −4.459/−2.726, −4.446/−2.859, −4.549/−3.177, −4.530/−3.282 eV, respectively. The bandgaps of P1, P2, P3 and P4 were determined to be 1.732 eV, 1.587 eV, 1.372 eV, 1.247 eV, respectively. Obviously, the trends in calculated HOMOs, LUMOs energy levels and bandgaps are in agreement with UV-vis-NIR absorption and CV data. P1 presents lower HOMO level than P2, while P3 presents lower HOMO level than P4.

3.4. Photovoltaic properties
The potential of the as-prepared four PNDFs as polymer donors for the BHJ cell were evaluated by blending with the PC61BM acceptor as the active layer. The processing additive, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), with a certain volume ratio,20,27 was added into the mixture solution of polymer:PC61BM in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), chlorobenzene (CB) or chloroform (CF) prior to the spin-coating process. The photoactive layers were then prepared by spin-coating of polymer:PC61BM mixture solution on ITO/PEDOT:PSS patterned substrates (50 nm). The film thickness of the active layers was controlled with the spin-speed during the spin-coating process. All devices were prepared under an inert nitrogen atmosphere and characterized in air without encapsulation, where J–V measurements were performed under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The PSCs were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC61BM/LiF/Al, with the composition of the active layer and solution for device processing investigated in detail. The photovoltaic parameters of all tested devices are summarized in Table 2.

Different solvents (o-DCB, CB or CF) were used for blending P2/PC61BM. The active layers prepared from o-DCB solutions showed the best film-forming property. P2/PC61BM blend with weight ratios (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3) has been investigated to optimize the photovoltaic properties. The P2/PC61BM weight ratio of 1:2 showed the best device performances. In order to further optimize the photovoltaic performance of the devices, different volume ratios of DIO in o-DCB were optimized for the preparation of active layers. The P2 devices made from o-DCB with DIO showed increased Jsc for the devices. The P2/PC61BM (1:2) device processed with 4% DIO gave a Voc of 0.44 V, a Jsc of 3.31 mA cm−2 and a FF of 57.7%, resulting in the highest PCE of 0.84%. The device optimization was further explored with thermal annealing the active layers at 80, 120 or 150 °C, respectively, for 15 min. However, the thermal annealing showed negative effect on device performance by significantly decreasing Jsc.
The P1/PC61BM weight ratio of 1:2 showed the best device performances. In order to further optimize the performance of the devices, P1 device made from CF with 2% DIO delivered the highest PCE of 0.53%, with a Voc of 0.45 V, a Jsc of 2.18 mA cm−2 and a FF of 55.6. Different P3 or P4/PC61BM weight ratios have been investigated to optimize the cell performance. The P3/PC61BM (1:1) device processed with 4% DIO gave a Voc of 0.37 V, a Jsc of 1.63 mA cm−2, a FF of 56.3%, and resulted in a highest PCE of 0.34%. At a 1:2 weight ratio of P4/PC61BM, the device using 4% DIO only gave a better PCE of 0.12%. The J–V curves for the PSCs with the highest PCEs are shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  
J–V characteristics of polymer:PC61BM devices as an active layer under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2). 
Comparing the photovoltaic data of P1–P4 with those of recently reported PNDFs using dithienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole19,21 and isoindigo as accepting unit,20 we found that both Voc and Jsc values for P1–P4 devices were lower, resulting in relatively lower PCEs. The low Jsc may be explained with the low hole mobility of our polymers. By adopting the similar FET mobility measurement method as our previous report,16 the hole mobilities of the un-annealed P1–P4 were measured to be in the range of 1.2–6.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is one magnitude lower than the corresponding copolymers of BDT and quinoxaline.16 Especially, P3 and P4 presented much lower hole mobilities than P1 and P2, which may explain the lower PCEs of P3 and P4. Though these two polymers possessed wider absorption bands than P1 and P2, they showed lower photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies. The lower mobility of PNDFs may be improved by more careful design of donating and accepting units for D–A polymers as well as better control of polymerization for high molecular weight polymers. The morphology observation for the active layers didn't find nanoscale phase separation between polymer and fullerene domains. More careful device processing and post-treatment may be needed to optimize the topography in the active layers for better device performance.
4. Conclusions
In summary, four new narrow bandgap polymers have been successfully synthesized by alternating naphthodifuran with fused benzotriazole or benzothiadiazole quinoxaline unit. All polymers exhibited narrow bandgap (∼1.2 eV), deep HOMO energy (∼−5.20 eV) and good solubility. The benzothiadiazole quinoxaline unit was shown to be a stronger acceptor and its copolymers with NDF exhibited absorption spectra beyond the NIR region. Primary PSC device tests delivered a best PCE of 0.84% for P2:PC61BM (1:2) blend. The optical properties, energy levels, as well as the photovoltaic properties of polymers were found to be effectively tuned by the acceptor unit. Considering the extremely narrow bandgap but high-lying HOMO energy levels, the quinoxaline based PNDFs may be used as organic photodetectors or applications where modulation of NIR radiation is necessary.28
