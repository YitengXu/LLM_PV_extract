1. Introduction
Cobalt, a d-block transition metal, is mainly deployed in the paint and ceramic industries1 and its compounds are often used as catalysts in an array of organic reactions namely hydro-formylation, hydrogenation, and dehydrogenation reactions, among others. Cobalt has quite a few beneficial effects when it comes to human health, being part of vitamin B12 for good maintenance and for the treatment for anemia as it instigates red blood cell formation. Although the exposure to levels of cobalt normally found in the environment is not harmful some of the water-soluble nickel and cobalt compounds may cause sensitization of the skin and airways and especially their oxides have allergenic potential.2
Cobalt has unique electrical, catalytic, magnetic and optical characteristics that make it suitable for a broad range of applications comprising, nanosensors, nanoelectronic gadgets and catalysts.3 It operates as the model system for the macroscopic magnetic response due to the low to medium crystal anisotropy permitting the influences of morphologies, sizes, internal crystal structures, and surface anisotropy to be recognized in one system.4,5 Cobalt and its three metastable phases with various crystallographic structures, including the hexagonal closed packed, face-centered cubic, and epsilon phases, have been considered as among the most important ferromagnetic metals.6,7 Several physicochemical methods have been developed for fabricating cobalt nanoparticles (NPs), including pyrolysis, hydrothermal decomposition, the modified polyol approach, the solvothermal process, liquid-phase reduction and template-based approaches.8,9
Cobalt oxide is a recognized antiferromagnetic p-type multifunctional semiconductor with a spinel crystal structure, the direct optical band gaps of Co3O4 NPs being about 1.48 and 2.19 eV, which makes it a suitable photocatalyst for the degradation of organic pollutants using visible light.10,11 Cobalt, in its oxide forms, can be found in different spin states, including high, low and intermediate spin which imparts attractiveness to the physics of the Co3O4 from a fundamental standpoint besides spintronic applications.10 These NPs have numerous significant applications in areas such as field effect transistors, storage of energy, catalysis, anode materials in rechargeable Li-ion batteries, electrochromic sensors, solar cells and as a photocatalyst. Additionally, these NPs have antibacterial, anticancer, antioxidant, antifungal, and enzyme inhibition properties, because of which they have superior biomedical applications.11–15
Generally, diverse physicochemical techniques have been applied for synthesizing cobalt and cobalt oxide NPs; these approaches are burdened with considerable disadvantages namely energy and time consuming operations requiring specialized equipment and being unfriendly to the environment (Table 1). To overcome the problems of energy imbalances and toxic wastes, some greener and eco-accommodating methods have been proposed as there is an increasing demand for the utilization of safer and environmentally friendly methods, which are simple, non-hazardous, and efficient in terms of operational cost and equipment. Biological, renewable and sustainable resources can be deployed in a swift, simple and cost-effective strategy to generate cobalt and cobalt oxide NPs which can eliminate the laborious and complicated physicochemical protocols.16–28

In this critical review, significant recent advancements pertaining to the diverse catalytic and biomedical applications of eco-friendly and sustainably produced cobalt oxide and cobalt NPs are discussed.
2. Sustainable synthesis of cobalt and cobalt oxide NPs
2.1. Bio-based methods
Sustainable synthesis of NPs has been an evolving research area in the field of nanobiotechnology and green chemistry with salient advantages over traditional physicochemical approaches namely concise and clean synthesis in a cost-effective manner deploying a facile methodology that is amenable to large scale fabrication of nanomaterials; there are barely any demands for applying high temperature, energy, and pressure and the use of hazardous materials. Using organisms for synthesizing cobalt and cobalt oxide NPs has garnered attention because of their non-toxic and economical nature which provides a single step technique for greener fabrication. Moreover, stability is bestowed on these NPs by biomolecules in these organisms, including steroids, enzymes, amino acids, proteins, saponins, tannins, proteins, phenols, vitamins, sugars and flavonoids; the majority of them are of biomedical and pharmaceutical importance and are eco-friendly.

2.1.1. Bacteria. 
Polymorphic cobalt oxide NPs of different sizes and shapes have been prepared using Micrococcus lylae, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Paracoccus sp., and Haloarcula vallismortis as bacterial templates.49 Additionally, nine lipases/carboxylesterases were successfully immobilized on these NPs, with supported Est-Y29, LmH, and Sm23 being considered for industrial applications; they exhibited significant catalytic prowess with increased stability and remarkable recyclability, which has significant potential for industrial applications (Fig. 1).49

(Upper and lower left figures) electron microscopic images and the prepared nanostructured materials; (right figure) the bacterial templates could be efficiently eliminated by calcination while retaining the original shape and size.

A protein cage comprising 12-subunit ferritin-like protein from Listeria innocua (a Gram-positive rod-shaped bacterium) was used as a size- and shape-constrained reaction environment for fabricating two cobalt oxide minerals, Co3O4 (crystalline) and Co(O)OH (amorphous).50 A reaction of Co(II) with H2O2 at pH 8.5 at either elevated temperature (65 °C) or ambient temperature (23 °C) initiated the generation of cobalt oxide NPs encapsulated within the protein cage; Co3O4 was produced at elevated temperatures while the oxyhydroxide Co(O)OH was obtained at lower temperature. Mineral particles, equivalent in size to the internal dimensions of the protein (∼5 nm), were surrounded by the intact protein cage as affirmed by the TEM images. It was surmised that high degree of spatial compartmentalization was the consequence of various electrostatic interfaces that ensued at the interior and exterior of this protein cage and the electrostatic properties of the interior surface directing the mineralization of transition metal oxides and oxyhydroxides.50 Possibly, this high local concentration at the protein–solution interface lowered the redox potential of Co(II) oxidation, thus enabling spatially selective oxidation. As in mammalian ferritin biomineralization, after nucleation, the primarily produced crystallite could act as a catalytic site for additional oxidative hydrolysis; the autocatalytic mineralization procedure within the protein cage for the mineral oxide afforded a remarkable level of control in the fabrication of size-constrained particles.50


2.1.2. Yeasts. 
Biomorphic cobalt oxide hollow microspheres with a cubic morphology have been prepared by using yeasts as bio-templates51 by initially coating them with cobalt hydroxide chloride and subsequently calcining them to eliminate the templates for attaining these microspheres. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy evaluation established that some inherent functional groups on the surface of yeast cells, such as carbonyls, amines and hydroxyls, might play significant roles in the generation of cobalt oxide microspheres; the possible mechanism is summarized in Fig. 2.51 Firstly, cobalt ions in the form [Co(H2O)6]2+ combine with carboxyl, amine and hydroxyl functional groups on the yeast cell walls, producing a hexaaquacobalt(II) ion encapsulation layer. Next, Co2(OH)3Cl was generated both on the yeast cell walls and in the solution after addition of ammonia. Then, the ensuing Co2(OH)3Cl clusters on the cell walls were motivated to grow via ripening and aggregations as the original templates offered a hybrid precursor with a remarkable surface-to-volume ratio, thus providing significant efficiency and probability of colliding with other clusters. Finally, the encapsulated microspheres were calcined at 400 °C to eliminate the yeast templates, and the subsequent dehydration and oxidization procedures produced cobalt oxide microspheres.51

2.1.3. Fungi. 

Aspergillus nidulans (an endophytic fungus) was deployed for greener fabrication of spherical cobalt oxide NPs (∼20.29 nm) that can be utilized in energy storage, as a specific capacitance of 389 F g−1 demonstrated competence.52 Additionally, Aspergillus brasiliensis ATCC 16404 has been used for making quasi-spherical shaped Co3O4 NPs (∼20–27 nm),53 the optimum conditions being 72 h reaction time in the dark, at pH 11 and room temperature, at 100 rev per min shaking speed using 4 mmol l−1 CoSO4·7H2O and 5 × 5% of A. brasiliensis dry weight (w/v). The ensuing NPs displayed significant magnetic characteristics and promising antimicrobial activities against pathogenic organisms.53


2.1.4. Plants. 
Numerous studies have been conducted for plant extract-based assembly of cobalt and cobalt oxide NPs (Table 2). For instance, cobalt oxide NPs (∼21–72 nm) have been prepared by using celery stalk and green tea leaf (Camellia sinensis) extracts; they showed remarkable antibacterial activities against bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.54 Cobalt oxide NPs have been prepared by applying Sageretia thea leaf extracts as the chelating agent and they exhibited good antibacterial activities against pathogenic organisms, especially Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli; remarkable cytotoxic potential was observed with IC50 (the half maximal inhibitory concentration) evaluated against amastigote cultures (3.16 μg ml−1) and axenic leishmanial promastigote (12.82 μg ml−1).55 Further, these biogenic cobalt oxide NPs showed 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging potential and antioxidant capacities;55 and they revealed α-amylase and protein kinase inhibition at high concentrations.55 In another study, greener synthesis of cobalt NPs was reported by applying secondary metabolites from Celosia argentea plant extract,56 they showed antioxidant activities against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical, and their scavenging power was reportedly accelerated with increasing concentration. Further, the ensued NPs showed good antimicrobial activities against several microbes and efficient activity for the degradation of common dyes.56 Crystalline and cubic cobalt ferrite and the corresponding silver doped NPs have been prepared via the sol–gel auto-combustion approach through greener chemical synthesis (Ocimum sanctum and Allium sativum extracts); absorption in the range 400–600 cm−1 (FTIR spectra) confirmed the production of spinel ferrites.57

Nanostructured crystalline cobalt aluminate (CoAl2O4) (∼71 nm) has been fabricated via an eco-friendly method using tamarind fruit extract.72 Further, crystalline cobalt NPs (∼25–40 nm) have been prepared by applying leaf extracts of Mangifera indica; the NPs were deployed in detecting Mn2+ ions, and can be used for developing nanosensors to identify the effluent contaminants; the maximum and minimum detection limits were 25 and 5 mM Mn(II) ions, respectively.74 The electrochemical oxidation of ascorbic acid on the surface of a cobalt NP modified carbon paste electrode has been investigated in alkaline media.75 Eco-friendly cobalt NP assembly was accomplished using Piper longum and its mixture (5% of w/w) prepared with carbon paste that exhibited desirable attributes for electrocatalytic activities in alkaline media. Furthermore, Co3O4 nanostructures have been produced by greener and cost-effective synthesis via the hydrothermal approach and using leaf extracts from A. linearis; ensuing cobalt oxide NPs, upon annealing, displayed ferromagnetic behavior as revealed by oxygen vacancies and could be deployed for self-cleaning and wastewater treatment applications.76
Single-phase crystalline cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) NPs (∼45–55 nm) have been prepared by using the gel from okra plants as the reducing agent.77 SEM and dynamic light scattering (DLS) evaluations revealed that the ensued spherical NPs showed a size in the range of 300–500 nm for the conventional heating method and 5–50 nm via the microwave (MW) technique; the MW-produced product revealed better magnetic behavior than the one obtained by conventional heating based on vibrating sample magnetometer evaluation. These NPs showed remarkable antibacterial and antifungal activities.77
Crystalline cobalt NPs have been prepared by applying extracts from the leaves of Chromolaena odorata wherein the FTIR spectrum obtained for ensuing cobalt NPs lacked absorptions at 3280.1, 2920.0, 1379.1 and 1222.6 cm−1, originally present for constituents in the extract and responsible for the cobalt ion bioreduction to the NPs.61 These NPs showed remarkable inhibition effects against the growth of Klebsiella pneumonia, E. coli, Streptococcus pyogene, and Staphylococcus aureus; they can be deployed for treating infectious diseases caused by these pathogenic organisms.61
A greener approach was explored for fabricating bimetallic silver/cobalt NPs, by applying Canna indica (leaves extracts) as the phyto-reducing and stabilizing agent, which can serve as colorimetric metal NP-mediated sensors;78 cluster-in-cluster nanocluster arrangement was discerned for the overlapping quasi-spherical NPs. Glycosides and terpenoids, significant phytochemical materials in C. indica, and the functional groups in bimetallic silver/cobalt NPs indicated the presence of biomass.78

2.2. Other environmentally sustainable synthetic methods
Besides the application of organisms, some innovative strategies based on the basic green chemistry principles have focused on the synthesis of cobalt and cobalt oxide nanomaterials, but it appears that more elaborative studies are still needed to identify greener chemical routes.

2.2.1. Ultrasound-enabled wet impregnation approach. 
A reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-supported magnetic CoFe2O4–titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalyst has been prepared via the ultrasound-enabled wet impregnation approach for efficient photocatalytic generation of H2.79 Mixing CoFe2O4 with TiO2 accelerated the generation of Ti3+ sites which significantly abridged the optical band gap of TiO2 from 3.20 to 2.80 eV. Further, the addition of RGO improved the charge carrier separation by generation of Ti–C bonds. A hydrogen formation rate of 76559 μmol g−1 h−1 has been attained deploying a 20 wt% CoFe2O4 and 1 wt% RGO-loaded TiO2 photocatalyst that displayed a 14-fold improvement when contrasted with the results obtained with the bare TiO2; a maximum quantum yield (∼12.97%) at 400 nm was detected for the photocatalyst, accredited to value-added charge carrier separation via Ti3+ sites and its synergy with the RGO scaffold. The magnetic separation aided recyclability was shown for more than 4 consecutive cycles, demonstrating the stability of the photocatalyst.79


2.2.2. Greener solid state method by applying cochineal powder. 
Cobalt oxide magnetic NPs have been fabricated via a greener solid state method by applying cochineal powder, an eco-friendly and bio-renewable natural source, as the synthetic precursor;80 the Co(NO3)2-cochineal complex was thermally decomposed at 400, 500 and 600 °C. The ensuing NPs remarkably decreased the percentage of 4T1 cells of breast cancer (IC50 = 2 mg ml−1) where the cell death was apoptosis, accompanied by the cellular oxidative stress acceleration. Thus, these NPs can be directed against invasive breast cancer cells as chemotherapeutic agents; however, additional in vivo studies are needed for the growth of their influences.80


2.2.3. Sustainable approach using carbohydrates and pigments. 
Cobalt hexaferrite NPs have been prepared by using carbohydrates and pigments as the natural reductants via the sol–gel approach81 where several factors, including types of reducing agents and amounts as well as the temperature and time of calcination, were identified as operative factors on the morphologies, sizes and purity of the ensued products. Later, carbon-based nanocomposites with graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were prepared with desirable photocatalytic activities which ranked in the order graphene-based nanocomposite > CNT-based nanocomposite > pure NPs.81


2.2.4. Greener synthesis of cobalt quantum dots (QDs). 
Electrochemical study on an economically feasible and advanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst has been realized from green-synthesized cobalt/graphene nanocomposite quantum dots (QDs);82 an excessive current density of 43.16 mA cm−2 was detected. In contrast, diminutive current densities were observed for Co NPs (21.1 mA cm−2), the value for the benchmark Pt/C commercial catalyst being 5.99 mA cm−2. Impedance evaluations demonstrated that the ensuing composite material had significant affinity for the OER of different studied constituents.82 Additionally, cobalt QDs (∼3.2 nm), uniformly dispersed on reduced graphene oxide, were utilized as an extremely efficient OER electrocatalyst platform. The synergy between abundant catalytically active sites via the acceptable dispersion of cobalt QDs, and improved electron transfer produced from the graphene instigated the first-rate electrocatalytic characteristics toward the OER. These advantages coupled with the remarkable stability of the nanocomposite provide significant potential for stimulating advances in electrocatalysis for water splitting.83


2.2.5. Combustion approach using curd. 
Cubic spinel nanostructured zinc-doped cobalt ferrites (∼12–21 nm) have been produced by the combustion approach using curd.84 The stretching vibrations for octahedral (385 cm−1) and tetrahedral (582 cm−1) sites have been established using FTIR. Density functional theory (DFT) evaluation has been performed to investigate the electronic characteristics of cobalt ferrite and Zn-doped cobalt ferrite nanostructures. Their utility in visible light-assisted photodegradation of Congo red and Evans blue dyes has been accomplished.84


2.2.6. Greener approach using levulinic acid. 
Levulinic acid, a renewable feedstock obtainable from biomass, can be harnessed for producing γ-valerolactone, an important platform molecule, the transformation being one of the crucial procedures for changing lignocellulose-based biomass into fuel and chemical materials. Interestingly, the utilization of levulinic acid for fabricating cobalt-based nanocatalysts and generation of γ-valerolactone were investigated.85 The template preparation of cobalt-levulinic acid on silica and its pyrolysis generated cobalt NPs as selective and significantly active catalysts for conversion of levulinic acid to γ-valerolactone under industrially viable and scalable circumstances. Other lactones emanating from various oxocarboxylic acids were synthesized in high yields. The preparation success for the Co-based valerolactone formation strategy was established by accomplishing production on a 20 g scale with recycling of the catalyst (Fig. 3).85

2.2.7. Greener method using gallic acid. 
Gallic acid has been deployed for the room temperature greener production of cobalt NPs (approximately 4–9 nm, flower-like microspheres) in an aqueous medium, pH 9.5 being favorable to generate well-dispersed flower shaped cobalt NPs.86 The highly stable NPs were used for removing methyl orange (MO) as the model azo dye; ∼0.4 mg of the recyclable catalyst could quantitatively remove the dye from MO aqueous solution (50 μM) (Fig. 4).86

2.2.8. Greener access using starch. 
Starch has been utilized as a green capping agent along with the sol–gel approach for the synthesis of cobalt oxide NPs87 which were employed in degradation of dyes. The application of water as the only solvent, low temperature processing, low cost of precursors and abundance of naturally occurring renewable polysaccharides are some of the remarkable advantages of this greener method.87 The photocatalytic degradation of dyes by the Co3O4 nanomaterial capped with starch is proposed as follows:  Co3O4(e−) + O2 → O2˙−Co3O4(h+) + O2− → OH˙OH˙ or O2˙− + Dye˙+ → Degraded products  


2.2.9. Sustainable synthesis of cobalt/cellulose nanocomposites. 
Interestingly, eco-friendly and sustainable assembly was deployed for the synthesis of cobalt/cellulose nanocomposites encompassing the α-cobalt phase as a major constituent with magnetic and antimicrobial characteristics. The in situ reduction of cobalt ion aqueous solutions on a model cellulose substrate surface by hydrogen gas afforded cellulose-stabilized spherical cobalt nanoclusters (∼7 nm) with magnetic characteristics; they were distributed over the surface of the cellulose fibers.88 These cobalt/cellulose nanocomposites showed suitable antimicrobial activities against pathogenic bacteria, with inhibition zones of more than 15 mm; thus, these advanced materials can be employed for treating wastewater or in medical dressings.88


2.2.10. Eco-friendly fabrication of nanoscale cobalt(II)-based MOFs. 
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have tunable pore sizes and interesting electrochemical characteristics.89–91 Solvothermal synthesis of two new MOFs based on cobalt metal, namely, [{Co0.5(5N3-IPA)0.5(1,2-bpe)1.25}]∞ (1) and [{Co(5NH2-IPA)(1,2-bpe)}]∞ (2) (5N3-IPA = 5-azidoisophthalic acid, 5NH2-IPA = 5-aminoisophthalic acid, and 1,2-bpe = 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene) has been reported.92 MOF 1 comprised a rare three-dimensional structure with 3-fold interpenetration, while MOF 2 had a 2D “pillar-layered” structure; these nanoscale MOFs exhibited hexagonal and square morphologies, respectively. Additionally, the heterogeneous catalytic activities of the MOFs 1 and 2 in aqueous medium have been evaluated towards dyes, Reactive Yellow HE4R (RY84), Reactive Black HFGR (RBH), rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MEB), under visible light irradiation conditions. The introduction of hydrogen peroxide was detected to remarkably increase the photocatalytic efficiency for dye degradation. Hydroxyl radicals (OH˙) served as the major active species during the oxidation, which was additionally confirmed by degradation experiments in the presence of tert-butyl alcohol, which can act as a radical trapper for hydroxide radicals in the reaction (Fig. 5).92

3. Catalytic and biomedical applications
3.1. Catalytic activities
These green-fabricated NPs have displayed significant catalytic activities for the decomposition of ammonium perchlorate and scorching of composite solid propellants; the kinetics of slow and rapid thermal decomposition has been studied by isoconversional and ignition delay approaches, respectively. The electrocatalytic function of the cobalt oxide NPs in dye-sensitized solar cells has been analyzed wherein cyclic voltammetry evaluations revealed significant electrocatalytic activities of the NPs toward the reduction of I3− to I− ions.60 In another study, highly efficient and eco-friendly approach for the synthesis of 1,8-dioxo-octahydroxanthenes was realized, catalyzed by a supported cobalt NP catalyst in water.93 The application of this heterogeneous catalytic system suggested various advantages, such as remarkable yields, low catalyst loading, short reaction times and easy workup. Additionally, the catalyst could be cost-effectively recycled for ten consecutive cycles without any substantial failure in catalytic activities.93
Various eco-friendly and sustainable catalysts have been produced by adorning CoO NPs on diverse carbon supports, which displayed good efficacy in the preparation of quinolines and naphthyridines, via Friedländer condensation.94 It was revealed that the textural characteristics, location and dispersion of the cobalt phase were remarkably influenced by the type of carbon support, metal concentration and cobalt precursor salt, in terms of catalytic performance. Therefore, the homogeneous distribution of the active phase and the presence of the mesopores and macropores in carbon aerogels were responsible for the product formation dictated by metal loading.94 It was amply demonstrated that the produced sustainable carbon-based catalysts have numerous advantages, namely simple preparation, remarkable stability and significantly accelerated catalytic performance, at ambient temperature and under solvent-free circumstances.94 A simple approach for supporting cobalt NPs onto the internal surfaces of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been reported;95 the CNT-encapsulated NPs serve as heterogeneous, well-organized, low-cost and green catalysts in the Heck cross-coupling to generate a library of functional entities more sustainably and could be recycled for at least nine successive runs without apparent reduction in activities.95 A cobalt oxide NP modified carbon paste electrode has shown significant electrochemical catalytic activities for the oxidation of glucose.96 The altered electrode for determining glucose had the advantages of simple assembly, high sensitivity, stability, and reproducibility; the constructed sensor is appropriate for diverse biomedical and food applications.96
Photocatalytic activity of cobalt oxide NPs has been analyzed in the degradation of Remazol Brilliant Orange 3R (RBO 3R) dye; these NPs (0.5 g) under 50 min irradiation time degraded 78.45% of the dye (conc. 150 mg L−1).69 The photocatalytic destruction of the dye was related to the collapse of the chromophoric functionality and the conversion of the dye into by-products of low molecular weight largely because of irradiation-assisted generation of electrons and holes on the catalyst surface (Fig. 6).69

The Co3O4/MnO2 nanotube-based hybrid catalysts have displayed significant catalytic activity for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol compared to the individual pure cobalt oxide NPs and MnO2 nanotubes.97 The evenly distributed NPs, the varying oxidation states of cobalt and manganese and the abundantly available oxygen species on the surface were involved in remarkable catalytic activities (Fig. 7 and 8).97 It has been proposed that benzyl alcohol molecules were absorbed on the Co3O4/MnO2 surface because of abundant oxygen species which then activated molecular oxygen (O2) as a consequence of the redox reaction between Co and Mn. Therefore, the active oxygen species on Co3O4/MnO2 oxidized benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and H2O; Mn(OH)2 endures swift oxidation by O2 to regenerate MnO2.98 The even dispersion of Mn, Co, and O elements in the hybrid catalyst, suitable redox behavior, plentiful oxygen species on the surface, and varied oxidation states (Mn3+/4+ and Co2+/3+) were all facilitated because of the synergistic interaction between MnO2 and Co3O4.97

It has been reported that palladium (Pd) NP deposition on the surface of Co/C NPs resulted in the production of significantly active and magnetically retrievable catalysts for hydrogenating alkenes.99 In one study, Pd NPs were adorned on porous silica shell C-coated Co NPs, making a magnetically retrievable catalyst for the reduction of alkenes, alkynes and nitroarenes; gentle conditions, easy separation of the catalyst with recyclability for four consecutive runs with a minimal leaching of 19 ppm and remarkable stability are some of the attributes of this eco-friendly and sustainable catalyst system. Carbon-coated Co NPs and silica with amine functionalization in their shell were synthesized from unfunctionalized Co/C nanobeads. In brief, silica treatment with tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) led to (2), followed by functionalization deploying 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTES) affording (3). An amine functionalized-catalyst, Pd@Co/C-SiO2-NH2 (5), served well for the hydrogenation of alkenes, alkynes and nitroarenes under ambient conditions, reaching a total turnover number of ≥2500. The Pd NPs are tightly entrenched in the Co/C magnetic NPs covered with an amine functionalized surface of silica, producing a stable, magnetically separable nanocatalyst with minimal leaching of Pd (Fig. 9).99

Interestingly, the synthesized cobalt NPs were implanted in N-doped carbon hollow nanocages (Co@NPC-H) via ion exchange;100 they exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic function as a catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the potential for application as electro catalysts with good efficacy for both the ORR and OER. The blend between the hollow structure and cobalt bifunctional active sites enabled the acceleration of the oxygen electrode activity and revealed its advantage for use in Zn–air batteries as a cathode catalyst.100 In another study, the catalytic function of cobalt NPs was illustrated in the synthesis of pyrano[2,3-c]pyrazoles through a four-component one-pot reaction of aryl aldehydes, malononitrile, diethyl acetylenedicarboxylate and hydrazine hydrate. The ensuing pyrano[2,3-c]pyrazole products were reportedly obtained in remarkable yields in an expeditious reaction with the nanocatalyst being simply separated by applying an external magnet and recycled a few times with no important reduction in its activities.101
Three-dimensional (3D) Co3O4/C NPs were synthesized using basil leaf extract102 where calcination was performed by utilizing an adequate carbon source from the extract to preserve the well-ordered Co3O4/C NP structure. The preparation of the plentiful porous structure clearly accelerated the activities, while extreme calcination temperature negatively influenced the activity. This preparation protocol would expectantly find appliance in the production of active Co3O4/C catalysts for the generation of hydrogen on demand.102
In heterogeneous catalysis, simplicity in the catalyst separation is critical for its effective recyclability and re-usability. The preparation of a carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)-stabilized Co NP (CMC-Co) catalyst and its smearing on the cellulose nanofibers derived from bacteria (BCN) as the scaffold have been reported for the production of the CMC-Co-BCN dip-catalyst strips. They could be used as dip-catalysts for the sodium borohydride reduction reaction of methylene blue dye and 2,6-dinitrophenol. Apparently, both the contaminants could be reduced at a faster rate by CMC-Co in comparison with the CMC-Co-BCN, but the latter possessed the advantage of ease of recovery for recurrent applications (Fig. 10).103

The eco-friendly synthesized Co3O4 (∼14.43 nm) and NiO NPs (∼18.15 nm) were applied as catalysts for conducting the gasification of solid kitchen waste and the transesterification procedure which were more efficient and took much less time at ambient temperature; the protocol generated high quality biodiesel which is environmentally friendly and more efficient. FTIR analysis of the generated biodiesels demonstrated the representative bands for CO at 1650 cm−1 which affirmed the preparation of the required methyl ester. Additionally, methane gas and char were produced as by-products. It was revealed that the application of solid waste as a resource for biofuel may promote green technology in the prevailing environment, which is sustainable and renewable energy.104
Cobalt oxide nanomaterials display remarkably dense and large pore structures, therefore offering great surface areas for the adsorption of dyes. Their prowess in terms of photocatalytic activities is attributed to the enhanced crystallinity and surface area of the material. For instance, the sunlight-promoted photocatalytic destruction of eriochrome black-T dye and murexide dye has been evaluated in wastewater by applying the cobalt and Co3O NPs;105 the synthesized cobalt NPs exhibited high destruction capability (44%) for murexide dye in 40 min at 25 mg loading, whereas Co3O4 NPs demonstrated a significant degradability (39%) for eriochrome black-T in 40 min at 10 mg loading upon exposure to sunlight. It was revealed that the MW-assisted preparation of NPs can be applied for the degradation of dye-laden wastewater as a greener protocol, with remarkable efficiency for photocatalytic degradations.105 Similarly, the cobalt oxide nanostructures have been studied for photocatalytic degradation of toxic and hazardous wastewater from dyeing industries;76 the green-synthesized Co3O4 nanostructures were evaluated for degrading a textile dye pollutant, Congo red, under visible light irradiation by analyzing Congo red (100 ml of 20 ppm) upon admixing 30 mg of the nanostructures in neutral medium. It was indicated that after visible light exposure of the admixed polluted wastewater and cobalt oxide photocatalyst for about 240 min, it degraded the dye to an extent of more than 96% (Fig. 11).76

Cubic spinel nanostructured CoCr2O4 was synthesized by a sol–gel approach and deployed as a valuable heterogeneous photocatalyst material for water treatment, the salient eco-friendly advantages being non-toxicity, inexpensiveness, and a process that is devoid of any organic solvents and surfactants.106 The photocatalytic activities of the prepared catalyst were studied in the aqueous solution of Eriochrome Black T dye; 90% of the dye could be significantly degraded after 90 minutes under visible light irradiation, neutral pH and room temperature.106
3.2. Biomedical applications
Cobalt and cobalt oxide NPs have several biomedical applications as biomedical sensors, as contrast enhancement agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as anti-proliferative agents for cancer cells, in hyperthermia treatment of malignant cells, and as site-specific drug delivery agents for cancer therapies.105,107,108 Additionally, they showed effective antimicrobial activities against Gram positive and negative bacteria.57

3.2.1. Antimicrobial activities. 
Antibacterial activity of the green synthesized cobalt NPs was measured by the disc diffusion approach where they showed antimicrobial activities against human pathogenic bacteria with high efficacy compared to an antibiotic, Ciprofloxacin.58 Similarly the antibacterial effects of the pure CoFe2O4 and Zn-doped CoFe2O4 NPs were evaluated against pathogenic bacteria; Zn-doped CoFe2O4 NPs demonstrated higher antimicrobial activities against Salmonella typhi compared to pure CoFe2O484 as they released heavy metal ions (Zn2+, Co2+, and Fe3+) upon contact with the cell membranes of the microbes. The positively charged metal ions are attracted to the negative charge of the cell membrane, and initiated the penetration of metal ions into the membranes of the cell. The existence of metal ions on the bacterial cell surface is facilitated by the thiol groups (–SH) of proteins. The produced proteins with the carried nutrients penetrated the cell membrane, wherein the inactivation of proteins was initiated by the NPs, thus causing bacterial death. It has been established that the prepared NPs acted directly on the bacterial pathogens to destroy the membrane's integrity and cells that culminated in the fatality of bacteria (Fig. 12).84

Cobalt ferrite and silver-doped cobalt ferrite NPs were more effective against Gram positive bacterial strains than for Gram negative, mostly because of the variance in their cell walls.57 The proposed mechanistic aspects of action could involve stress that ensued from reactive oxygen species (ROS) engendered by the interaction of metal species with oxygen or producing the disturbance of electronic or ionic transport, as a consequence of the remarkable attraction of the NPs for cellular membrane culminating in the antibacterial activities (Fig. 13). These metal doped cobalt ferrites may be further investigated for biomedical applications.57

The biological synthesis of cobalt oxide NPs using Hibiscus Rosa-sinensis flower extract has been reported; these NPs have been studied for their size-dependent antibacterial and antifungal activities15 wherein Co3O4 NPs showed remarkable antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, Aspergillus flavus, and A. niger. The fabricated cobalt oxide NPs, with a crystalline and hollow sphere-like shape, can be applied for environmental remediation.59 Two possible mechanistic aspects have been suggested (Fig. 14): first, the various positive states of cobalt ions (Co2+ and Co3+) in Co3O4 NPs interact with the negatively charged part of the bacterial cell, thereby destroying the bacterial cell. Secondly, the light irradiation on the Co3O4 NPs surfaces can excite electrons in the positive hole in the valence band and the conduction band. The formation of a superoxide radical anion is a consequence of the reaction of oxygen molecules with excited electrons in the conduction band, followed by hydrogen peroxide formation, a strong oxidant. The accompanying reaction of water with the superoxide radical anion on the NP surface results in the disappearance of bacterial strains entirely. Concurrently, the reaction of water with the positive hole in the valence band generates hydroxyl radicals. These ensuing superoxide and hydroxyl radicals do not have any influence on penetration into the cell membrane; they hover around the outer portion of the bacterial cell and disintegrate the lipids and proteins. Thus, cobalt oxide NPs have the potential to serve as antibacterial agents at concentrations on the nano level and would have superior influence for destroying microbial organisms.59

3.2.2. Hyperthermia treatment of malignant cells. 
Innovative materials for hyperthermia treatment of malignant cells with a sufficient degree of tissue warming effects and destruction, and negligible collateral damage with no drug consumption, are appealing propositions. Co NPs showed remarkable potential for hyperthermia treatment of tumors, due to their significant saturation magnetization and large anisotropy.107 But, biocompatibility is very important for their integration into biomedicine, and while titanium implants owe their biocompatibility to thin oxide layers formed on the surface in the existence of air and water, the same phenomenon is a considerable drawback when magnetic cobalt NPs transform into non-magnetic oxide compounds. For attaining suitable biocompatibility and preventing oxidation, a surfactant which is operative in adjusting the reactivity of the NPs without influencing their magnetic characteristics is typically applied.107 Indeed, the covalent bonding of carboxylic acids to the NPs increases the biocompatibility, while avoiding the generation of surface oxides which decrease the magnetic characteristics of cobalt. The organic–inorganic interactions in the cobalt-acid system can be considered as a basis for the rational design of biocompatible metallic NPs.107


3.2.3. Cellular labeling and carriers for biomolecules. 
Indeed, for biomedical purposes, the surface of magnetic NPs needs to be appropriately engineered to obtain enhanced colloidal stability in physiological media, biocompatibility, drug encapsulation capability and precise target ability to ensure appropriate interaction with cells or tissues; surface functionalization and water solubility of NPs are very important.109,110 In one study, the synthesized cobalt ferrite NPs (∼7 nm) by refluxing Fe(acac)3 and Co(acac)2 in diethylene glycol and ethanolamine showed superparamagnetism at room temperature. Consequently, amine functionalized NPs demonstrated acceptable cell viability, (above 94%) at a concentration of 80 μg mL−1 in MCF7 and L929 cell lines. It was revealed that these nanostructures with their suitable magnetic characteristics, appropriate aqueous dispersion stability and remarkable biocompatibility can be considered as good candidates for biomedical purposes, including drug delivery and cellular labeling applications.109
The carbon-coated cobalt NPs with polyhydroxy-, polyamine- or PEG2000-functionalized dendrons or polymers either via the covalent or non-covalent p-stacking ligation approach have been functionalized. Because of the significant magnetization and the non-polar shell of the parent material, a high loading of polar groups was a prerequisite for the generation of dispersions which are stable in water, and it is desirable for biomedical applications. It was reported that dendrons, with a loading of up to 1.3 mmol g−1 amino or hydroxyl groups being presented on the surface of the particles, turned out to be inadequate to break-up the agglomeration of the highly magnetic core material. However, a covalently attached polyethyleneimine-polymer with a loading of approximately 10–14 mmol amino groups per gram of nanomaterial occurred in NPs which could produce stable dispersions in water. They can be deployed as carriers for biomolecules via attachment using the orthogonal, non-covalent functionalization method by p-stacking before or after producing the polyethyleneimine-polymer on the NPs by covalent ligation.111


3.2.4. Anti-proliferative effects against cancer cells. 
Co NPs showed mild anti-proliferative effects against cancer cells (cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer (A2780/CP70)) with gentle behavior towards normal cells. Human red blood cells demonstrated <5% hemolysis, revealing the compatibility of cobalt NPs with human red blood cells which is vital for in vivo biomedical applications without producing destructive influences in the human bloodstream.112 In another study, it was shown that the cobalt oxide NPs remarkably decreased the survival percentage of 4T1 cells of breast cancer with an IC50 of 2 mg ml−1. The main mechanistic aspect regarding cell death was apoptosis, along with an increase in cellular oxidative stress. Thus, the synthesized NPs can be employed as a chemotherapeutic agent against invasive breast cancer cells; additional analyses are still needed regarding in vivo study for approving their effects.80


3.2.5. Biosensors. 
Biosensors with significant sensitivity, low detection limit, and remarkable selectivity are in great demand in various disciplines. For instance, daclatasvir, a hepatitis C antiviral drug, is mentioned in the World Health Organization (WHO)'s list of essential medicines required in a basic health system; thus, electrochemical and impedance spectroscopic techniques are essential to obtain important details regarding its mechanism by applying a carbon paste electrode modified with chitosan/multi-walled carbon nanotubes and cobalt NPs.113 Additionally, the simultaneous determination of daclatasvir with the hepatitis B antiviral drug entecavir was evaluated by differential pulse voltammetry in universal buffer pH 2.0. The experimental findings identified a linear relationship between the daclatasvir peak current and its concentration in the range from 1.0 nM to 12 μM, leading to a detection limit of 8.82 × 10–10 M. Thus, such an innovative sensor can be successfully employed for the determination of essential medicines in biological samples and pharmaceutical formulations.113 In another study, the electrochemical detection of ascorbic acid was analyzed by applying cobalt(III)-ferritin immobilized on a self-assembled monolayer modified gold electrode in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.5);114 the improved electrode exhibited remarkable electrochemical activities for the oxidation of ascorbic acid. The obtained biosensor demonstrated a linear response to ascorbic acid in a concentration range from 6.25 × 10−6 to 2.31 × 10−5 M with a sensitivity of 86437 μA M−1 and a detection limit of 4.65 × 10−6 M based on a signal-to-noise ratio of three.114
A cobalt oxide NP-modified glassy carbon electrode was produced for efficient enzyme-less sensing of glucose108 where the sensor showed significant time-saving performance for determining glucose, and this sensitive amperometric process was effectively employed for quantifying glucose in batch and flow systems; glucose was evaluated in a linear range of 0.7–60 μM with a limit of detection of 0.15 μM and a sensitivity of 2515.35 μA mM−1 cm−2 in the batch system and in a linear range of 1.3–50 μM with a limit of detection of 0.14 μM and a sensitivity of 3240.25 μA mM−1 cm−2 in the flow system.108 In another similar study, a thin film of cobalt was deposited by potentiostatic polarization of glassy carbon in 10−2 mol L−1 cobalt chloride interface, in boric acid at pH 5.5115 followed by the anodic oxidation of the cobalt film in sodium hydroxide solution at pH 12. It was revealed that the selection of reduction potential of Co2+ ions and oxidation potential of the cobalt film was crucial to achieve a stable deposit with an approved faradaic efficiency. Consequently, these thin cobalt oxide films were utilized for the development of an electrochemical sensor for glucose determination, in the concentration range from 133 μM to 1.99 mM, with a sensitivity of 4.6 μA L−1 mol−1. Some salient features are the potential for controlling the electrochemical sensor dimensions and low-cost procedures.115

4. Toxicity issues
4.1. 
          In vivo toxicity
Besides numerous applications of cobalt and cobalt oxide NPs, their toxicity and genotoxicity analyses have been scarcely conducted, with few reports mentioning cobalt NP-stimulated genotoxic influences in vivo;116 exposure to cobalt NPs apparently initiated oxidative stress and inflammation, which have been shown to be related to genotoxic and carcinogenic influences.116 Additionally, it was revealed that cobalt oxide NPs do not generate toxic influences on normal cells in an in vivo system.117 Findings showed that these NPs provoked a remarkable amount of reactive oxygen species in lymphocytes, activated the signaling pathway of TNF-α-caspase-8-p38-caspase-3 to primary immune cells, and stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokines. Consequently, in vitro and in vivo evaluations demonstrated the increased TNF-α after cobalt oxide NP treatment.117 This TNF-α phosphorylated the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase followed by activation of the caspase 8 and caspase 3 which could stimulate cell death. Further, it was revealed that bare cobalt oxide nanomaterials can be toxic to primary human immune cells that deal directly with human health. However, by surface modifications or functionalization, additional applications of these NPs in industrial settings or in biomedical fields can be envisioned.117
4.2. Environmental toxicity
The environmental toxicity of the synthesized NPs should be evaluated as nanomaterials have eco-toxic influences, due to their special shapes and small sizes, and greater surface area to volume ratio, leading to remarkable chemical reactivity and biological activities, thus posing threats to the environment and humans.118 In one study, the green synthesized cobalt oxide NPs (∼10 nm) using natural resources were subjected to eco-toxic evaluations; they were found to be relatively non-toxic and safe towards the environment, and exhibited only minor toxicity at very high concentrations i.e. 750 μg per disc NPs.62
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, cobalt and cobalt oxide NPs are steadily gaining broader applications, because of their magnetic, catalytic, optical, antimicrobial and biomedical characteristics. They are garnering more investigations, especially in terms of their production via greener and eco-friendly methods as has been exemplified for the fabrication of cobalt and cobalt oxide nanomaterials, using sustainable methods from many research groups. It appears that greener prepared Co NPs have remarkable potential in terms of efficient, safe, nontoxic, and eco-friendly synthesis for diverse catalytic and biomedical applications, but not many studies have focused on applications of these eco-friendly fabricated NPs, and more elaborative studies are needed. It should be noticed that the reusability of NPs in effective repeated recycling and the stability of adsorbents for varied applications are crucial parameters for economic and commercial success. Additionally, regulating and optimizing the morphologies, especially the properties and sizes, will increase the possibility of commercial applications of these NPs.
For scaling up and commercial applications of the green synthesis strategies, it is critical to investigate the influences of related kinetic factors, including temperature and time, as well as the other important parameters (e.g., pH and pressure) for clarification of the mechanistic aspects and optimized conditions. Further investigations of NPs using different characterization techniques including size exclusion chromatography, gel electrophoresis and DLS, as well as cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, eco-toxicity and biocompatibility evaluations (especially for biological and biomedical applications), should be comprehensively and systematically accomplished. Thus, future studies of prospective green synthesis should be directed toward extending the laboratory-based scale to the industrial production of nanomaterials by considering important issues, especially those pertaining to toxicity, health and the environment.
