    , Accepted 22nd March 2021First published on 23rd March 2021AbstractThe addition of coadsorbents and the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups in dye sensitizers are considered feasible strategies for improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). However, facile and precise predictions of the influence of these two strategies on their photovoltaic properties, including PCE, are challenging. In this contribution, we studied a known D–A–π–A indoline dye WS-2 adsorbed on a TiO2 anode represented by a supercell model. The PCE of this dye was evaluated to be between 9.69% and 13.70%, depending on the supercell representation, compared with an experimental value of 8.55%. The PCE could be increased to 16.39% on a moderate supercell by adding chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as a coadsorbent. Such an enhancement could be ascribed to the intermolecular interaction between WS-2 and CDCA, suppressing excessively high dye coverage and thereby resulting in a remarkable increase in the open-circuit voltage. Based on WS-2, a new molecule WS-2a was rationally designed by substituting the benzothiadiazole moiety of WS-2 with a stronger electron-withdrawing thienyl-diketopyrrolopyrrole group. Consequently, the maximum absorption band showed a large red-shift from 522 to 638 nm, broadening the spectral response into the near-infrared region. A higher PCE of 16.62% was obtained for WS-2a. Moreover, the coadsorption of WS-2a and CDCA onto the TiO2 supercell achieved the best photovoltaic efficiency with a value as high as 24.15%. Therefore, the present study quantitatively reveals the impact of the coadsorbent and electron-withdrawing groups on the optoelectronic properties of dyes, which opens a new avenue to design high-efficiency D–A–π–A-structured organic sensitizers for promising DSSC applications. A discussion on the qualification of these results is given.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have shown tremendous potential in photovoltaic applications, due to the superior qualities of low manufacturing cost and high photovoltaic efficiency.1,2 In such devices, dye sensitizers, which serve as the light-harvesting antennae, have been certified to play an indispensable role in immensely improving the solar cell performance. Among various sensitizers, metal-free organic dyes have received much attention, owing to their easier structure modification, lower synthesis expense, and higher molar extinction coefficient in comparison with metal-containing ones.3–6 Currently, DSSC devices have realized a photovoltaic efficiency of 13.6%7 using single metal-free dye and an even higher 14.3%8 based on two cosensitized metal-free dyes.
Typically, a pure organic dye mainly contains electron donor (D), π–spacer (π) and electron acceptor (A) segments, for instance, with a D–π–A or D–A–π–A motif. Compared with the conventional D–π–A-structured system, the D–A–π–A type organic dyes with an additional auxiliary acceptor between the D and π-linking groups have been found to be advantageous in terms of decreasing the band gap between frontier molecular orbitals and red-shifting the absorption band with an intramolecular-charge-transfer character, thus improving their light-harvesting ability.9,10 To further enhance the photovoltaic efficiency of solar cells, different molecular design strategies for dye sensitizers have been adopted, including, but not limited to, (i) the introduction of more electron-rich groups in the donor unit, (ii) the extension of the π-conjugation length in the π–spacer group, (iii) the regulation of the acceptor/anchoring group, and (iv) the addition of coadsorbents or cosensitizers. Based on these design criteria, various D–A–π–A type organic dyes have been developed and applied in DSSC devices, showing outstanding photovoltaic performances.11–16 Among such D–A–π–A systems, indoline-based organic dyes have triggered special interest owing to the excellent electron-donating ability of the indoline part.17–30 A representative example in the indoline family is dye WS-2 possessing an indoline derivative as the donor unit, a benzothiadiazole (BTD) as the auxiliary acceptor, a thienyl group as the π-bridge, and a cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor/anchoring segment (see Scheme 1).22 Using iodide/triiodide as the electrolyte, a WS-2-based DSSC device achieved a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 18.19 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 653 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.72 under AM 1.5 solar light, corresponding to a power conversion efficiency (η) of 8.55%.22

Despite such important contributions, accurate theoretical descriptions of the photoelectric behaviour of organic dyes, especially of the role of the coadsorbent, are still challenging. Considering the technical complexity and high expense of the synthetic process for dye sensitizers, theoretical estimations based on reliable computational methods and theoretical models can be viewed as a promising alternative for obtaining high-efficiency dye sensitizers with potentially wholesale applications in DSSCs.31–38 However, few theoretical studies of the effect of the coadsorbent on the electronic structure and photophysical properties of dye molecules have been reported.39 In particular, the photovoltaic performances of organic dyes in the assistance of the coadsorbent have not been evaluated from a theoretical viewpoint. For this purpose, we performed a systematic theoretical study on the photovoltaic performances of the known dye WS-2 without and with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as the coadsorbent. Based on WS-2, a novel dye molecule WS-2a was rationally designed by substituting the BTD moiety in WS-2 with a thienyl-diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) group (see Scheme 1). The only structural variation between WS-2 and WS-2a was the auxiliary acceptor between the indoline-based donor and the thienyl π-bridge, which was BTD for WS-2 and TDPP for WS-2a. Such a molecular engineering of the auxiliary acceptor part remarkably increased the power conversion efficiency of indoline-based dyes from 9.69% (WS-2) to 16.62% (WS-2a) in the absence of CDCA, demonstrating its essential role in the molecular modulation of the photovoltaic performance. The utilization of CDCA could further enhance the efficiencies to 16.39% and 24.15%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, these are record high predictions for indoline-based organic dyes. These values should be qualified by the quenching mechanisms in solar cells that were not considered theoretically; for further details, see the Discussion section.
Results and discussion
Theoretical design
In order to explore the influence of auxiliary acceptors on the photovoltaic performances of organic dyes, and to further prepare organic dyes for potential applications in DSSCs, a new dye molecule WS-2a was designed theoretically on the basis of the reported dye WS-2, involving the dye-monomer (WS-2 and WS-2a) and dye-dimer (2WS-2 and 2WS-2a) forms. Subsequently, CDCA was utilized as the coadsorbent to determine the impact of the introduction of CDCA on their electronic structures, absorption spectra, and photoelectric parameters. Single adsorption of the dye and CDCA as well as the coadsorption of the dye + CDCA on the anatase TiO2(101) surface were simulated by using the 2 × 3 × 6, 4 × 3 × 6, and 4 × 4 × 6 supercell models, corresponding to (TiO2)36, (TiO2)72, and (TiO2)96, respectively. A section describing the detailed computational details can be found in the ESI.† All the structures obtained in this work are provided in Fig. S1–S4 of the ESI.†
Light-harvesting capacity
The light-harvesting capacity, involving the absorption coverage and intensity, is one of the most significant elements for estimating the properties of dye sensitizers in solar cells. To achieve high cell performances, the absorption spectra of dye molecules should have substantial overlap with the solar spectrum for obtaining wide spectral response ranges. Herein, we simulated the UV-vis absorption spectra of dyes WS-2 and WS-2a in the respective monomer and dimer forms without and with CDCA, and these are plotted in Fig. 1, while the pertinent photophysical data and details on the frontier molecular orbitals involving the highest-occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and lowest-unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are presented in Tables S1 and S2 of the ESI,† respectively. The calculated LUMOs of WS-2 and WS-2a were −2.90 and −3.07 eV, respectively, which were remarkably higher than the conduction band energy (−4.0 eV) of the TiO2 anode, thus ensuring the efficient electron injection from the LUMOs of the dye to the TiO2 anode. In comparison to WS-2, WS-2a had a higher electron injection ability owing to its larger electron affinity (see Table S3, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  UV-vis absorption spectra of the targeted molecules in their monomer and dimer forms without and with the assistance of CDCA simulated by the CAM-B3LYP functional in CH2Cl2 solution. 
In the case of WS-2, the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) under the optimized dye-monomer structure was calculated to be 522 nm, which agreed very well with the experimental value (550 nm) of dye WS-2 observed in CH2Cl2 solution.22 The λmax estimated using the 2WS-2 dye-dimer form was 525 nm, demonstrating that the intermolecular interaction in WS-2 resulted in a slight red-shift of the maximum absorption band, when no CDCA was added. The coadsorption of CDCA caused a hypsochromic shift of 8 nm for the λmax of WS-2, in comparison with the corresponding absorption spectrum without CDCA. Such a change can be simply explained by the introduction of CDCA inducing a slight ring twist between the indoline donor and BTD auxiliary group (see Table S4, ESI†). According to molecular exciton theory,40 the interaction between WS-2 and CDCA should belong to the face-to-face aggregation form (H-aggregation). However, the coadsorption of CDCA yielded a bathochromic shift of 10 nm for the λmax of 2WS-2. This implies that the strong edge-to-edge aggregation (J-aggregation) instead of H-aggregation was the dominant form between 2WS-2 and CDCA, which is obviously beneficial for the improvement of the light-harvesting ability of dye sensitizers in real devices.
For WS-2a, the λmax values were predicted to be 638 and 639 nm for the WS-2a and 2WS-2a forms, respectively (see Fig. 1b). In addition, the corresponding molar absorption coefficients (ε) were also higher than those of dye WS-2. This clearly indicates that the stronger electron-withdrawing TDPP group can tremendously broaden the absorption range and enhance the absorption intensity, red-shifting their maximum absorption bands to the near-infrared (NIR) region. Accordingly, dye WS-2a is expected to possess a stronger light-harvesting ability than dye WS-2. On the other hand, the addition of CDCA induces bathochromic shifts of the maximum absorption bands (13 nm for WS-2a and 9 nm for 2WS-2a). This means that only the J-aggregation form was found for dye WS-2a with the assistance of CDCA, which will be more favourable for improving the power conversion performance because of the efficient ability of capturing the wider spectral response photons.
To assess the total light-harvesting capacity of dye sensitizers, the maximum short-circuit current density JmaxSC was computed (see Theoretical Models section in the ESI†). The light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) curves and the JmaxSC results are depicted in Fig. 2. The corresponding JSC values and the parameters related to JSC are provided in Table S5 of the ESI.† Apparently, the LHE curve coverages of dye WS-2a were broader than those of dye WS-2, which implies that the former had better light-harvesting efficiency. In the meantime, the JmaxSC of dye WS-2 in different conditions increased along the series: WS-2 + CDCA (17.16 mA cm−2) < WS-2 (18.10 mA cm−2) < 2WS-2 (19.01 mA cm−2) < 2WS-2 + CDCA (19.80 mA cm−2), which is obviously accordant with their absorption spectral ranges discussed above. It is worthy to note that all the JmaxSC values of dye WS-2a were higher by over 6 mA cm−2 than those of dye WS-2, which implied that dye WS-2a may be a promising candidate organic dye with higher power conversion efficiency in DSSC applications.

Single-adsorption and coadsorption models of dye/CDCA onto the TiO2(101) supercell
For a deep understanding of the interface properties between the dye/coadsorbent and the TiO2 supercell, it was necessary to construct a dependable adsorption model including the dye, coadsorbent and TiO2. We first needed to make sure that the vacuum layer height of the TiO2 supercell was no less than 8 Å, and the distances between the dye molecules in the edge cell were no less than 7 Å. In addition, the size of the supercell shouldn’t be too large, otherwise it would lead to too long a calculation time and increase the difficulty of the calculations. Herein, we constructed the adsorption configurations of the dye molecule with and without CDCA as the coadsorbent on the surfaces of (TiO2)36, (TiO2)72 and (TiO2)96 supercells. A bidentate bridging (BB) pattern was employed in the present calculations, in which two interface O–Ti bonds were formed between two O atoms of the –COOH group of the dye and two Ti5c atoms of the TiO2, and the proton in the –COOH moiety was shifted to the surface two-fold O2c atom of the TiO2 to form the surface –OH group. This BB model has been proven to be the most stable adsorption configuration in a great deal of dye@TiO2 adsorption systems.36,39 The resulting adsorption energy (Eads) and bond distance (DTi–O) using the moderate (TiO2)72 supercell model are displayed in Table 1, and the relevant data based on the (TiO2)36 and (TiO2)96 supercells are also given (see Table S6, ESI†). It should be mentioned that the Z-axis of the supercell boxes of WS-2 and WS-2a was not consistent because of their different molecular heights, thereby leading to the difference in the CDCA single-adsorption energies in the two supercell boxes (see Table 1); however, such a difference had no effect on the below conclusions.

As can be noticed from Table 1, the negative Eads and short DTi–O are favourable for increasing the electron injection rate from the excited dye to the TiO2 surface. It can also be seen that the adsorption energies for the single adsorption of WS-2 and CDCA onto the (TiO2)72 supercell were −0.89 and −0.10 eV, respectively. When WS-2 and CDCA were coadsorbed onto the (TiO2)72 surface to form the (WS-2 + CDCA)@(TiO2)72 complex system, the corresponding adsorption exothermicity was 2.54 eV, which was significantly larger than the total of the exothermicities for the two single-adsorption systems of WS-2@(TiO2)72 and CDCA@(TiO2)72 (0.99 eV). In addition, the exothermicity of WS-2 adsorbed on the CDCA@(TiO2)72 system was 2.44 eV, also much greater than that of WS-2 onto (TiO2)72 (0.89 eV). These results suggest that the adsorption of CDCA could stabilize the WS-2@(TiO2)72 system very well. However, such a phenomenon was not found in the adsorption models, including (TiO2)36 and (TiO2)96 (see Table S6, ESI†). This clearly indicates that the adsorption model including (TiO2)72 was the most stable and reliable for the WS-2 + CDCA system. Additionally, this particular choice of the (TiO2)72 supercell also provides a good balance between computational cost and realistic modelling.
In the case of WS-2a, the whole exothermicity of the (WS-2a + CDCA)@(TiO2)72 coadsorption system was 1.87 eV, larger by 0.87 eV than the sum of exothermicities of the WS-2a@(TiO2)72 and CDCA@(TiO2)72 single-adsorption systems. However, a reversed trend was detected for the (WS-2a + CDCA)@(TiO2)96 coadsorption system, where the adsorption exothermicity of (WS-2a + CDCA)@(TiO2)96 was only 0.97 eV, smaller by 0.50 eV than the total of exothermicities of the WS-2a@(TiO2)96 and CDCA@(TiO2)96 single-adsorption systems (1.47 eV). This implies that the (WS-2a + CDCA)@(TiO2)72 is a more stable adsorption model than the (WS-2a + CDCA)@(TiO2)96, and the photovoltaic parameters estimated using the (WS-2a + CDCA)@(TiO2)72 adsorption model should be more reasonable.

Fig. 3 shows the aligned density of states (DOS) and projected DOS (PDOS) of WS-2 and WS-2a adsorbed on the (TiO2)72 supercell without and with CDCA. The corresponding DOS and PDOS for the (TiO2)36 and (TiO2)96 supercells are presented in Fig. S5 (ESI†). It is apparent that the calculated LUMO was located above the CB minimum (CBM) energies of the TiO2 substrate, which provides a sufficient driving force for an effective electron injection from the LUMO of dye to CB of TiO2 (see Table S7, ESI†). In addition, the utilization of CDCA did not result in a clear change in the band alignment, as found in the calculations of the absorption spectra (see Fig. 1), where a negligible change was observed in the visible light range. This clearly reveals that despite increasing the thermostability of the dye@TiO2 adsorption system, the coadsorption of CDCA had an inappreciable influence on the electronic structure and optical absorption behaviour of the dye molecules.

Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic performances of the two targeted dyes without and with the CDCA coadsorbent on different TiO2(101) supercells were evaluated by means of reliable and tested theoretical models (see the ESI†). The detailed photovoltaic parameters of the short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and corresponding power conversion efficiency (η) are tabulated in Table 2, and the photocurrent density–voltage (I–V) curves are presented in Fig. 4.

 Fig. 4  Calculated I–V curves of the two targeted dyes anchored on the (TiO2)72 supercell. 
As shown in Table 2, an increase in the TiO2 supercell size had a negligible influence on the short-circuit current density; however, increasing the supercell size from (TiO2)36 to (TiO2)72 varied the open-circuit voltage very remarkably. In the absence of CDCA, the VOC of dye WS-2 was dramatically decreased from 872 mV estimated using the (TiO2)36 model to 641 mV using the (TiO2)72 model. It is notable that further increasing the supercell size from (TiO2)72 to (TiO2)96 had no significant influence on the open-circuit voltage of WS-2, with a deviation of ∼20 mV. As a consequence, dye WS-2 showed the best optoelectronic performance under the (TiO2)72 supercell model, along with a JSC of 18.09 mA cm−2, a VOC of 641 mV, an FF of 0.83 and an η of 9.69%, which were the closest to the experimentally available data observed under AM 1.5 irradiation (JSC = 18.19 mA cm−2, VOC = 653 mV, FF = 0.72 and η = 8.55%).22 This clearly indicates that the (TiO2)72 supercell was the most appropriate model for predicting the photovoltaic property of dye WS-2.
Concerning dye WS-2a, under the (TiO2)72 supercell model, JSC was calculated to be 24.98 mA cm−2, much higher than that of WS-2, benefiting from the broader spectral response and larger absorption intensity detected in the absorption spectrum of WS-2a. Additionally, the VOC of WS-2a was higher by ∼136 mV than that of WS-2, due to the fact that TDPP possesses two lactams, making it a stronger electron-withdrawing unit than the BTD in WS-2, and the introduction of TDPP in WS-2a induces less charge recombination, thus resulting in a significant increase in the open-circuit voltage. Consequently, our designed dye WS-2a showed a higher power conversion efficiency than the reference dye WS-2 (16.62% vs. 9.69%), while no CDCA was used. This clearly demonstrates that introducing a stronger electron-deficient auxiliary group in D–A–π–A dye systems will be a feasible means to improve their optoelectronic performances.
In most cases, the addition of coadsorbents, such as CDCA, can enhance the photoelectric properties of the DSSC devices, which profits from its important role in inhibiting dye aggregation on semiconductor substrates.40–42 Based on this, we further estimated the photovoltaic properties of the dyes WS-2 and WS-2a with CDCA as the coadsorbent, which are also shown in Table 2 and Fig. 4. Apparently, the utilization of CDCA had a distinctly different influence on the photoelectric performances for both WS-2 and WS-2a. The JSC values of these two dyes were almost unchanged, with the deviation of ∼1 mA cm−2 without and with CDCA, showing a good correlation with the optical absorption spectra discussed above. However, the VOC values drastically increased after the addition of CDCA, being ∼1.5 times larger than those without CDCA. Such an extreme enhancement in VOC is attributed to the introduction of CDCA preventing or suppressing the excessive aggregation of adsorbent dyes, thus decreasing the surface coverage of the dye on the TiO2 surface and consequently inducing less charge recombination. Therefore, the power conversion efficiencies were clearly increased for WS-2 (from 9.69% to 16.39%) and WS-2a (from 16.62% to 24.15%) under the (TiO2)72 supercell model. For the two dyes, the increment in the power conversion efficiency caused by the addition of CDCA was comparable to that observed in phenothiazine-based DSSCs, in which the efficiency was increased from 5.24% to 10.45%.42 Compared with the reported WS-2, WS-2a exhibited a better photovoltaic efficiency whether CDCA was added or not. This again proves that the TDPP group is an excellent electron-withdrawing unit for dye molecules, and our designed WS-2a featuring the TDPP group can be considered to be a promising candidate for highly efficient organic dyes in DSSC applications.
Comparison of the photovoltaic properties among indoline-based dyes
To provide a direct comparison of the photovoltaic performance among the applied indoline-based organic dyes and our designed dye WS-2a, we collected the photovoltaic parameters of typical indoline dyes possessing the same donor and anchoring groups (see Table S8, ESI†). Their corresponding geometric structures are also shown (see Fig. S6, ESI†). Among these dyes observed experimentally, their intramolecular-charge-transfer (ICT) absorption bands were measured to be below 570 nm, leading to a photocurrent density of less than 20 mA cm−2, and their relevant photovoltaic efficiencies were mainly concentrated in the 3–10% range. In the current work, dye WS-2a in the absence of CDCA showed a near-infrared long-wavelength absorption with the ICT band centred on 638 nm, along with a higher photocurrent density exceeding 24 mA cm−2, and higher photovoltaic efficiency of 16.62%, in comparison to its indoline analogues. This is a remarkable theoretical improvement of photovoltaic performance for indoline dyes. More importantly, a maximum of 24% was achieved for dye WS-2a using CDCA as the coadsorbent, which of course needs to be further verified experimentally to ensure the feasibility of the theoretical model on WS-2a.
The above given values are, as already noted, record highs for indoline-based organic dyes. As for satisfying the basic requirements for commercial applications with the threshold value of 15%,43 these should be attractive for further commercial development. The results should of course be qualified by the theoretical model applied and by the number of loss mechanisms that occur in a solar cell. The theoretical model is holistic in that it accounts for the short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage and fill factor, each with a special parameterization as shown in the ESI.† The losses can be of different kinds: junction loss, recombination loss, thermal loss, contact voltage loss, etc. It is thus comforting that the results of the validation tests for WS-2 for different supercell models (9.95%, 9.69% and 13.70%) all exceeded the experimental value of 8.55%. We believe that the predicted values for the best case – dye WS-2a using CDCA – were overestimated by, at least, a similar fraction, considering the losses and the dependency of the supercell model. However, the predicted trends may here be more important than the absolute values for the photoelectric efficiency, and we can, from the present work and with a high degree of certainty, state that the WS-2a-CDCA dye is a most promising candidate for experimental tests in solar cells.
Conclusions
In summary, we performed a comparative investigation on two indoline-based organic dyes, called WS-2 and WS-2a by using first-principles calculations coupled with dependable and tested theoretical models. Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was utilized as the coadsorbent, which is known to be favourable for inhibiting the aggregation between dye molecules. The simulated absorption spectra and photovoltaic parameters of dye WS-2 showed a good correlation with the experimentally measured results, suggesting the combined computational method and theoretical model are effective for accurately describing the optical and optoelectronic properties of such indoline dyes. Compared with the known dye WS-2, our newly designed dye WS-2a showed a wider absorption range and larger absorption intensity in the absorption spectrum, thus exhibiting a better light-harvesting ability. As a consequence, the power conversion efficiency was drastically improved from 9.69% of WS-2 to 16.62% of WS-2a. The utilization of CDCA further improved the efficiencies very remarkably for WS-2 (from 9.69% to 16.39%) and WS-2a (from 16.62% to 24.15%). This clearly indicates that the addition of coadsorbents and the involvement of stronger electron-withdrawing groups in organic dyes are two effective strategies for enhancing the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC devices manufactured using such dye systems. As discussed in the paper, considering all the quenching mechanisms in a solar cell and the dependency on the supercell model, the predicted values are probably too high, while the trends in the efficiency of dyes are credible, going from WS-2, where validation numbers are available, to the high-performance WS-2a-CDCA composite system. Therefore, the present theoretical study can provide a general guide for fabricating high-efficiency DSSC devices embedding organic dyes.
