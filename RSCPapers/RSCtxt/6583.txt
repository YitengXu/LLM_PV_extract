    , Accepted 6th September 2022First published on 8th September 2022AbstractBy virtue of the prominent features of low cost, high surface area, wide potential window, high theoretical capacity and rich valence states, manganese (Mn)-based materials and their composites have attracted great interest as electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage (EES). Meanwhile, Mn-based materials with two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures have gained immense attention due to their larger specific surface area, which exposes active sites and increases the contact with the electrolyte. In the review, the several main categories of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials including Mn-based oxides, hydroxides/layered double hydroxides (LDHs), sulfides, phosphides, and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are systematically introduced to offer a comprehensive overview about their structure and application for EES. Meanwhile, the recent advances in the investigation of their synthesis strategy, crystal structure, and electrochemical storage energy mechanism are summarized. Based on the relationship between the 2D nanostructure and electrochemical properties, their applications in supercapacitors (SCs), alkali (Li and Na)-ion batteries, and multivalent metal (Zn and Mg)-ion batteries (MIBs) are discussed in detail. Furthermore, this paper summarizes the representative strategies to overcome the bottlenecks of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials for energy storage by introducing high conductivity materials, constructing advanced structures, and designing defect engineering. In addition, we discussed the challenges of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials for SCs and MIBs and provided prospective insights for the future development of this research direction.
1. Introduction
In the context of economic globalization, society is increasingly dependent on energy. The development of human civilization is inevitably accompanied by excessive consumption of fossil energy sources, which has a significant impact on the environment through pollution and global warming.1,2 Therefore, it is urgent to develop sustainable and efficient technologies for energy storage. More and more worldwide endeavors are focused on renewable resources, such as solar energy, wind energy, tidal energy and electrochemical energy storage (EES).3,4 Among them, EES devices can overcome the intermittency issue of renewable energy production systems and play an integral role in next-generation electronics.5,6 In general, EES devices mainly include rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors (SCs).7,8 In the past few decades, SCs have attracted much attention because of their high power density, long life and potential applications for portable electronic devices such as wearable electronic products and flexible devices.9 Based on faradaic reactions, SCs can be divided into electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors (PCs).10 In addition to SCs, rechargeable metal-ion batteries (MIBs), such as Li-, Na-, Zn-, and Mg-ion batteries, are also considered as promising devices for EES. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely concerned and applied since they were put forward for the first time in 1990 because of their high energy density and high output voltage.11 Nevertheless, the relatively low abundance of lithium in the earth's crust and safety concerns limited the application of LIBs. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are gradually gaining acceptance due to their low cost, natural abundance and high energy density.12 Besides, due to the multi-electron transfer ability of multivalent-ion batteries, they can provide higher capacity compared with monovalent ions, thus providing higher theoretical gravimetric and volumetric energy densities.13 Multivalent-ion batteries (Zn-, Mg-, Ca-, and Al-ion batteries) have been widely studied for EES. However, the development of EES devices has also been influenced by electrode materials remarkably. Currently, the main obstacles to realizing high-performance EES devices are the low capacity and poor cycling stability of electrode materials.14
In recent years, transition metal oxide/hydroxide materials, such as iron-, vanadium- and manganese-based oxide/hydroxide materials, have been widely reported and applied in EES.2,15 Among them, Mn-based materials hold great promise as new and efficient electrode materials for EES.16 In general, Mn-based materials can be divided into Mn-based oxides (MnO, MnO2, Mn2O3, Mn3O4, and spinel MMn2O4/MnM2O4), Mn-based hydroxide/layered double hydroxides (Mn(OH)2/MMn-LDHs) and other Mn-based materials (MnS, Mn-MOFs, Mn(PO3)2, etc.). Mn-based materials receive tremendous interest as desired electrode materials for SCs and MIBs because of their significant merits: (i) Mn element has multiple valence states that can convert between Mn(III)/Mn(II) and Mn(IV)/Mn(III) during an electrochemical charge/discharge process. The reversible redox transitions enable the high specific capacitance of Mn-based materials.10,17 (ii) Compared with other transition metal materials, Mn-based materials possess the characteristics of higher theoretical capacity, higher electrochemical activity and lower operating potential. Especially, MnO2 with the properties of high theoretical capacity and different crystal structures has become the most widely studied Mn-based material.18 (iii) Mn-based materials are nontoxic, environmentally friendly and earth-abundant. These unique features will enable Mn-based materials to serve as high-performance, safe and low cost devices for EES.18,19
It is well known that the nanostructure has a significant influence on the electrochemical properties.7 Two-dimensional (2D) materials led by graphene have gained great attention in electrochemical energy storage applications.20,21 Materials with a 2D nanostructure that have structural similarities to graphene have been greatly explored to provide huge potential for the development of EES devices.22,23 2D nanostructures, such as nanosheets and nanoplates, usually feature a short electron and ion transport distance, a high specific surface area and abundant active sites for redox reactions.24 The high electrochemical activity of Mn-based materials coupled with a 2D nanostructure makes 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials become a preferable electrode choice for EES.25 Furthermore, 2D nanostructured Mn-based electrode materials have demonstrated a higher capacitance and cycle stability than other nanostructures.26,27 The respective advantages and disadvantages of different nanostructures of Mn-based materials are shown in Fig. 1. Owing to the high capacitance, wide potential window and low cost, 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials have received growing publications. The numbers of publications containing EES since 2009 with the inset of applied areas with SCs, LIBs, SIBs and multivalent-ion batteries are shown in Fig. 2a. Furthermore, the development history of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials for SCs, LIBs, SIBs and multivalent-ion batteries is demonstrated in Fig. 2b.

(b) Schematic illustration of the development history of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials for SCs, LIBs, SIBs and multivalent-ion batteries. 
Although 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials have been extensively studied as electrode materials for SCs and MIBs. Some intrinsic problems of Mn-based materials still exist and restrain their further advancements. For instance, Mn-based materials commonly suffer from poor electronic conductivity because of their wide band gap and low ionic diffusion constant.18 Besides, the problem of poor cycling stability caused by Mn dissolution needs attention.28 To acquire improved electrochemical performance, recently many efforts have been focused on the fabrication of 2D nanostructured Mn-based composite materials.29 Incorporating highly conductive materials into 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials can obviously boost the conductivity and capacitive performance, such as, using carbon-based materials as conductive substrates, which not only supply a supporting framework but also enhance the electrochemical conductivity of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials.30 Moreover, other highly conductive materials, such as graphene, MXenes and LDHs, coupled with 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials have also demonstrated fantastic effects on electrochemical performance.31–33 Designing defect engineering with 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials is an effective strategy to improve structural stability and increase capacitance.34,35 The advanced strategies of defect engineering are summarized including ionic defects, element substitution doping and interlayer and tunnel doping.36–38 Previous reports have illustrated the most comprehensive reviews on nanostructured electrode materials with outstanding electrochemical properties. However, one of the barriers to achieving higher energy density nanostructured electrode materials is that they usually possess low tap density, which further results in low volumetric capacity.39,40 Besides, 2D nanostructures tend to re-stack and agglomerate, which restrains the ion and electron diffusion, resulting in the decrease of capacitance.41 It is highly desirable to construct structurally superior structures, for instance, 3D nanoflowers with 2D nanosheets, mesoporous structures and core–shell nanoarrays. The optimized nanostructures not only supply open channels enabling the electrolyte to easily penetrate into the electrode, but also are used as supports to improve the structural stability.42–44
In this review, we conclude recent electrochemical achievements and representative synthesis strategies of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials for SCs and rechargeable MIBs. As far as we know, previous reviews tend to investigate Mn-based materials used in SCs or MIBs individually. In the current study, there is no comprehensive summary to report their applications in both MIBs and SCs. In this regard, we sum up the detailed introduction of the latest studies on 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials for SCs and MIBs, and further explore the relationship between the 2D nanostructure and electrochemical performance. Finally, some constructive modification strategies are proposed to aim at providing some suggestions for 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials applied as high performance energy storage devices.
2. Crystal structures of typical Mn-based materials
Mn-based materials are one of the most widely reported materials because of their diverse structures and rich valence states.45,46 MnO usually shows as the structure of rock salt without tunnels. It belongs to the space group with Fm3m.47 The crystal structure of MnO is shown in Fig. 3a. MnO2 has many different crystal structures, mainly including α-MnO2, β-MnO2, γ-MnO2, todorokite-type MnO2 (T-MnO2), δ-MnO2, and λ-MnO2. Generally, the differences of MnO2 crystal structures are caused by the different joint positions of the basic building unit of MnO6 octahedrons.17 Among the different types of MnO2 as-mentioned, tunnel-type MnO2 materials mainly include α-MnO2, β-MnO2, γ-MnO2, and T-MnO2.48–50 Tunnels constructed from [MnO6] octahedral units are classified in the m × n format, where m and n represent the numbers of [MnO6] octahedra constituting the tunnel height and width, respectively.51 α-MnO2 contains 2 × 2 (4.6 × 4.6 Å) and 1 × 1 (1.89 × 1.89 Å) tunnels in a network of [MnO6] octahedra, which consists of corner-shared double chains (Fig. 3b).52,53 α-MnO2 is tetragonal with the space group I4/m.54 β-MnO2 is tetragonal with the space group P42/mnm.55 R-MnO2 has a 1 × 2 tunnels (2.3 × 4.6 Å) structure (Fig. 3f). This type of MnO2 crystallizes in an orthorhombic system with the space group Pnma.56,57 γ-MnO2 is actually an intergrowth between β-MnO2 and R-MnO2. Thus, in general, 1 × 1 tunnel and 1 × 2 tunnel cross sections coexist in γ-MnO2 (Fig. 3d), which has the space group C2/m.17,50 T-MnO2 has relatively large tunnels with 3 × 3 square cross sections since it is constructed from triple chains composed of [MnO6] octahedra (Fig. 3e). It belongs to a monoclinic system with a P2/m space group.58,59 Layered type δ-MnO2 has a larger interlayer spacing (∼7.0 Å), which is composed of [MnO6] octahedra by sharing their edges to form sheets (Fig. 3g). δ-MnO2 is hexagonal with the space group R3m.60,61 Obviously, layered type MnO2 has the advantage of large interlayer spacing, and metal cations or water molecules are usually contained in the interlayer to stabilize the layered structure, which is beneficial to obtain better electrochemical performance.62 λ-MnO2 with a spinel structure contains a three-dimensional network of interlinked 1 × 1 channels (Fig. 3h). The type of MnO2 is cubic with the space group Fd3m.55,63 Various MnO2 forms have been investigated and the results demonstrate that the crystallographic form of MnO2 influences the electrochemical performance.46 The capacitive properties for several crystallographic structures of MnO2 (α, β, γ, δ and λ) have been investigated. The specific capacitance measured for MnO2 was found to depend strongly on the crystallographic structure, and it decreased in the following order: α ≈ δ > γ > λ > β.64 Mn2O3 appears with two polymorphs, cubic α-Mn2O3 and tetragonal γ-Mn2O3. α-Mn2O3 (C-type structure) has a body-centered cubic lattice with the space group Ia3 (Fig. 3i).65,66 Mn3O4 has a tetragonal crystal system and the space group I41/amd (Fig. 3j).44 Common Mn-based spinel structures include normal spinel structures (ZnMn2O4 and LiMn2O4) and inverse spinel structures (Mn2CrO4, where Mn is a divalent and a trivalent cation). Tetrahedral and octahedral positions in the normal spinel structure are occupied by divalent and trivalent cations respectively. In the inverse spinel structure, octahedral positions are occupied by divalent cations and half trivalent cations, and the other half trivalent cations occupy tetrahedral positions.67,68 ZnMn2O4 is a non-tunnel spinel structure with a tetragonal crystal system, in which Mn3+ occupies the octahedral position to form the MnO6 group, and Zn2+ occupies the tetrahedral positions to form the ZnO4 group (Fig. 3k). The space group of ZnMn2O4 is I41/amd.69,70 Mn(OH)2 has a layered crystal structure with an interlayer spacing of about 0.47 nm. Mn(OH)2 is hexagonal with the space group P3m1 and the crystal structure is shown in Fig. 3l.71 Generally, the electrochemical performance of Mn-based materials is inseparably related to the crystal structure. Layered δ-MnO2 with large interlayer spacing of or α-MnO2 with large channel of tunnel structures often obtain widely studied because they provide more space to accommodate ion intercalation. Mn-based oxide materials with different crystal structures for ZIBs are shown in Table 1.

3. Synthesis methods of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials
3.1. Hydrothermal/solvothermal method
The principle of hydrothermal/solvothermal reactions refers to a heterogeneous chemical reaction under high temperature and high pressure in the presence of a solvent. The hydrothermal method and the solvothermal method are similar synthetic methods, but the reaction medium is different. The reaction precursor is heated and dissolved in a sealed Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and recrystallized into the required material, in which the shape and structure of the product can be controlled by conditions such as temperature, reaction time and solvent amount.72 The advantages of hydrothermal preparation are uniform particle size distribution, simple operation, green route, good dispersion, good crystal form, controllable morphology and so on.73 Hydrothermal preparation is one of the principal methods for the preparation of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials, such as MnO2 nanosheets,74 Mn2O3 nanowalls,75 Mn3O4 nanosheets,76 lithium manganite hydrate nanosheets,77 NiMn2O4 nanosheets,78 CoMn2O4 nanosheets,79 MnCo2O4 nanosheets,80 Mn(OH)2 nanoflakes,71 and NiMn-LDHs.81
Generally, the target product can be obtained mostly by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. A facile route to obtain a MnO2 nanosheet array on carbon fibers was finished by the reaction of KMnO4 and HCl and the autoclave was sealed and maintained at 85 °C for different reaction times (20 min, 40 min, 1.5 h, and 3 h).82 In another study, carbon cloth (CC) was used as the reducing agent in an in situ redox replacement reaction with KMnO4 to obtain MnO2 nanosheets. Well-ordered MnO2 nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth have been prepared hydrothermally at 150 °C for 6 h as illustrated in Fig. 4a.83 γ-MnO2 nanosheets loaded on a chain-like Ni surface were synthesized through a redox reaction between KMnO4 and Ni under hydrothermal conditions. The TEM and SEM images of Ni@MnO2 nanocomposites and MnO2 synthesized in the absence of Ni are illustrated in Fig. 4b–e.84 In order to obtain a novel morphology, the composite of MnO2 is usually synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal method. For example, CuCo2O4 nanoflakes were synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method, and then after cooling treatment, KMnO4 solution was added, and then hierarchical assembly of MnO2 nanosheets on CuCo2O4 nanoflakes was obtained by a two-step hydrothermal method.85 A novel seed-assisted hydrothermal method used Ni(OH)2 nanorod arrays as seeds, and mesoporous Ni–Co–Mn hydroxide (NCMH) nanoflakes were uniformly grown on Ni foam, resulting in high electrochemical performances (Fig. 4f).86 In a typical solvothermal process, CoMn2O4 nanosheets have been synthesized from the precursors of MnSO4·H2O and CoSO4·7H2O using various volume ratios of ethanol to water. The volume ratio of ethanol to water played an important role in the electrochemical performance. The optimum ratio was 3:5, and then the solvothermal reaction was carried out at 90 °C for 6 hours.79 Stoichiometric amounts of Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O and Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O at a molar ratio of 1:3 were dissolved in a mixture of 42 mL deionized water and 7 mL ethylene glycol to form a homogeneous solution. Then the solution was heated at 190 °C for 12 h and after pre-calcination and annealing, 2D nanodisc LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 was obtained finally.87

3.2. Chemical precipitation method
The chemical precipitation method refers to the target substance by simply mixing two different solutions at a certain temperature. Because of saving time, simple operating procedures, low cost, and easy control of preparation conditions (can be carried out even at room temperature), it is widely used to synthesize 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials.88 Dang et al. synthesized MnO2 ultrathin nanosheets via a simple method in which KMnO4 was dissolved in 50 mL deionized water, and then carbon nanospheres were added and heated to 70 °C.89 Adopting a one-step enhanced chemical bath deposition (ECBD) method at a low temperature (∼50 °C), size- and thickness-controllable MnO2 nanosheets were fabricated. Meanwhile, BrO3− acted as a novel morphology controller and compensated for the non-uniform formation, which enabled the one-step synthesis of 2D MnO2 nanosheets.90 A certain concentration of KMnO4 solution was uniformly mixed with CH3COOC2H5 in a boiling flask with water-bath heating. Then, under magnetic stirring, the solution was condensed and refluxed at 85 °C to obtain ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets (Fig. 4g).91 Inverse opal MnO2 constructed from few-layered ultrathin nanosheets was reported. The route was that sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was dissolved in polystyrene latex microsphere (PS) suspension with stirring, and then 0.1 M H2SO4 prepared in advance was added to form a weakly acidic solution. The solution was heated to 70 °C under stirring and 0.05 M KMnO4 was added, and then maintained for 30 minutes with stirring to obtain the target substance with a novel structure.61 Similarly, single-layer MnO2 nanosheets have been prepared via a redox reaction between KMnO4 and SDS by Liu et al.92 In addition to KMnO4 as the Mn source, some Mn-containing salts are often used to synthesize Mn-based oxides. Peng et al. prepared bulk 2D MnO2 nanosheets using MnCl2·4H2O as the Mn source and the reaction was carried out at room temperature without heating. Briefly, a mixed solution of (NH4)2S2O8 and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) (25% wt) was added into 3 M MnCl2·4H2O solution slowly. A dark brown bulk 2D MnO2 sample was obtained after vigorous stirring overnight at room temperature. Pristine MnO2 nanosheets were obtained by adding bulk 2D MnO2 nanosheets into water for ultrasonic treatment under a constant temperature of 25 °C for 1 h (Fig. 4h).93
3.3. Electrodeposition method
Electrodeposition is one of the most widely used methods for preparing thin film electrodes. It has the advantages of easy process control, less pollution, and the ability to prepare large-area thin films. By adjusting the electrolyte and electrodeposition parameters, the structure and morphology of the product can be effectively controlled.94,95 In addition, the change of different surface morphologies will be caused by different electrodeposition technology modes, which mainly include potentiostatic (PS), potentiodynamic (PD) and galvanostatic (GS).96 Concerning Mn-based electrodes prepared by electrodeposition, many effects have been focused on anodic electrodeposition. Briefly, Mn2+ ions in electrolytes are oxidized to Mn4+ forming deposited films onto substrates.60 For example, by adjusting the concentration of H2SO4, concentration of the electrolyte and deposition current density, MnO2 nanosheets were electrodeposited on carbon fiber paper for the first time.97 In a typical synthesis, Co(NO3)2 and Mn(NO3)2 were taken in a molar ratio of 9:1, and loaded on Ni foam with the potentiostatic deposition method. Ultrathin nanoflakes of Co–Mn LDH were prepared at a constant potential of 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in a three-electrode configuration.98 Li's group fabricated a Mn(OH)2@activated carbon cloth (ACC) self-supported electrode through a simple one-step electrodeposition method. Changing the deposition potential, ultrathin multilayer amorphous Mn(OH)2 nanosheets were coated on AC. The structure provides a large number of active sites for surface and bulk ion diffusion, which greatly improves the capacitance performance of the electrode.95
3.4. Other methods
Other methods have also been used to prepare 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials. The thermal decomposition of KMnO4 to prepare MnO2 is a common and simple way.62 An eco-friendly method is one-step solid-phase reaction, which fabricated a 2D hierarchical Mn2O3@graphene composite with NaNO3, MnSO4 and graphene in muffle furnace at 350 °C.99 A hierarchical architecture of birnessite Na0.5MnO2 nanosheet assembled nanowall arrays was fabricated on carbon cloth by the electrochemical oxidation. Mn3O4 nanowall arrays via CV scans between 0 and 1.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in a 10 m Na2SO4 electrolyte for 500 cycles and Na0.5MnO2 nanosheets were obtained.100 Compared with the methods requiring high-temperature treatments, the bottom-up self-assembly strategy is relatively simple to accomplish.101 Qin et al. synthesized mesoporous MnO2 nanosheets by supramolecular self-assembly of 2D freestanding lipid bilayers from amphipathic aliphatic amine (OTA). The schematic of the synthesis for 2D mesoporous MnO2 nanosheets is shown in Fig. 4i.25 An interface reaction includes aniline monomer dissolved in CCl4 organic phase and KMnO4 dissolved distilled water. The reaction mixture was maintained at 5 °C for 24 hours, in which time the chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline and the reduction of KMnO4 occurred simultaneously at the water/organic interface. Through the continuous diffusion of aniline from the organic phase to the water phase, the layer-by-layer self-assembly of polyaniline (PANI)-intercalated MnO2 nanolayers was acquired. Cation intercalation in MnO2 nanosheets was reported via a bottom-up strategy. Owing to their polyelectrolytic and colloidal nature, the layer-by-layer self-assembly of MnO2 nanosheets with cations leads to the formation of porous frameworks. Owing to the exchangeable guest cations, the interlayer spacing between the MnO2 nanosheets can be adjusted.102
Briefly, due to the advantages of simple operation and controllable synthesis, the hydrothermal/solvothermal method has become the most common method for the synthesis of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials. In addition, better crystallinity can be obtained in combination with a high temperature calcination process. The different synthesis methods to prepare 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials are listed in Table 2.

4. Energy storage mechanism of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials
SCs can be divided into EDLCs and PCs according to whether a redox reaction occurs or not.10,103 Based on the energy storage mechanism of different materials, SCs can be further differentiate into EDLCs, surface redox or intrinsic PCs, intercalation PCs and battery-type faradaic reaction.104 As illustrated in Fig. 5a, the contribution of capacitances of carbon-based materials is due to the adsorption of anions and cations at the electrode/electrolyte interface, which demonstrates an obvious EDLC type behavior. The CV curves of carbon-based materials are rectangular-box-type in nature.105 The pseudo-capacitive reactions store electrical energy through fast and reversible redox processes at the electrode surface (Fig. 5b). The most common pseudo-capacitive materials include RuO2 and MnO2.106 Although, the CV profiles for surface-redox materials closely resemble those of carbon-based materials, they can store charge via both surface faradaic and double layer mechanisms.107 Some layered materials, such as Nb2O5, undergo faradaic charge transfer due to the intercalation of electrolyte ions into the tunnels or layers with no crystallographic phase change as illustrated in Fig. 5c. Compared with the surface pseudocapacitance, the charge storage process for the intercalation pseudocapacitance is not limited to the surface, which mainly relies on the reversible faradaic electrochemical reaction of materials. The CV curve of the Nb2O5 material has an obvious redox peak.108 The conventional battery-type electrode materials show phase change during the electrochemical process (e.g. Ni and Co oxide/hydroxide). Moreover, during the charging–discharging process, the potential of the battery-type electrode remains constant, agreeing with the phase rule and following the Nernst equation (Fig. 5d). The CV profiles display a couple of well-defined redox peaks. MnO2 exhibits obvious pseudocapacitive features and stores charge through surface or bulk redox reactions in between the +4 and +3 oxidation states of Mn.106 The other pseudocapacitive properties of Mn oxides strongly depend on their crystallinity and crystallographic structures.109 In light of reports, the spinel crystal structure of Mn3O4 and MnFe2O4 showed pseudocapacitive features.107 In addition, different physical processes also lead to different mechanisms (EDLC or pseudocapacitance).104

According to the charge storage mechanism of SCs, they can be divided into EDLCs, PCs, and asymmetric and hybrid supercapacitors (ASCs/HSCs) (Fig. 6). EDLCs form an electric Helmholtz double layer on the electrode surface through ionic interaction/physical adsorption/desorption, so carbon-based materials with strong adsorption properties are commonly used materials for EDLCs.110 PCs undergo a faradaic process to store charge, which largely depends on the electron affinity of the electrode material. Therefore, fast redox reactions are required for electrode materials. The common materials include conducting polymers, metal oxides and noble metals.111,112 ASCs combine two different electrodes but they are both capacitor type. ASCs composed of Mn-based materials are common, such as AC//MnO2.113 HSCs involve one battery type electrode (usually transition metal oxides (TMOs)) and one capacitor type electrode (conductive carbons). So, HSCs undergo a dual charge storage mechanism in a single device. The electrodes of HSCs mainly include metal ion capacitors, redox-electrolyte capacitors and battery-capacitors.114

Mn-based oxide electrode materials for LIBs can be mainly classified into two types based on reaction mechanisms: (1) conversion reaction; this electrochemical process can be summarized as:115,116 MnOx + 2xLi+ + 2xe− ↔ 4Mn + xLi2O(1)
The Li storage mechanism based on the (2) electrochemical intercalation/deintercalation reaction can be explained as:117,118 MxOy + nLi+ + ne− ↔ LinMxOy(2)
Most TMOs, such as iron-, cobalt-, nickel- and manganese-based oxides, belong to the first type, and they usually have high theoretical specific capacity. However, serious volume changes occur during charge/discharge cycles, so their stability is poor. In contrast, TiO2 and V2O5 are based on an intercalation/deintercalation mechanism and characterized by a relatively low theoretical specific capacity. This type of TMO can host Li ions to generate LinMxOy and maintain good structural integrity without collapsing during the charge/discharge process and ensure a long cycle life.118,119 Generally, most Mn-based materials, spinel LiMn2O4 and ZnMn2O4, have been reported widely as cathodes for LIBs, and Mn-based oxides are usually chose as anode materials.28,70,120
For SIBs, the reaction mechanism is similar to LIBs.121,122 The materials of SIBs are classified based on the storage mechanism, including intercalation types, conversion types, alloy types and conversion/alloy types.12 Weng et al. reported MnO2 as the conversion anode for SIBs for the first time. The Na-ion through a general conversion mechanism is similarly as mentioned LIBs.123 Na0.44MnO2, prepared for the first time via a solid-state route by Sauvage et al., had a structure comprised of wide tunnels and attracted attention as a possible cathode electrode material for intercalation.124 The schematic illustration of Mn-based materials for aqueous rechargeable metal ion batteries is shown in Fig. 7a.28

At present, there are four known reaction mechanisms in aqueous ZIBs, which are Zn2+ insertion/extraction, H+/Zn2+ co-insertion/extraction, deposition–dissolution mechanism, complex electrochemical reactions with the co-participation of Zn2+, H+, Mn2+, and SO42−.125–128 Schematic diagrams and redox reactions at the anode and cathode for the four different Zn2+ storage mechanisms in Mn-based aqueous ZIBs are shown in Fig. 7b.129 Many compounds with tunnel-type and layered-type structures enable the insertion/extraction of Zn2+ ions into/from their hosts owing to the small ionic radii of Zn2+ (0.74 Å).17 Taking α-MnO2 for instance, Kang et al. first reported on mild aqueous rechargeable ZIBs, composed of an α-MnO2 cathode, a zinc anode, and a mild ZnSO4 or Zn(NO3)2 aqueous electrolyte. They proposed to reversibly insert or extract Zn2+ into/from the tunnels of the α-MnO2 cathode during discharge/charge. At the same time, the metal zinc anode would also undergo dissolution/deposition behavior.130 Some studies have also confirmed that MnO2 and Mn3O4 can be explained by other mechanisms.44,131 Kang and colleagues proposed that a proton conversion mechanism exists in the β-MnO2 cathode. In the first discharge cycle, β-MnO2 is converted into MnOOH and dissolved into Mn2+. In the next cycle, the deposited MnO2 reacts with protons to form MnOOH and Mn2+ is deposited as MnO2 during the charging process. The reaction path of β-MnO2 during cycling is illustrated in Fig. 7c.132 A flower-like δ-MnO2 nanostructure was reported by Wang et al. and Liu et al. Electrochemical characterization and ex situ XRD tests demonstrated the co-intercalation of H+ and Zn2+ into δ-MnO2 during the discharge process.133,134 In addition, different Mn-based oxides and all Mn-based oxide materials are compared in Fig. 7d, which suggest that Zn2+ insertion/extraction and H+/Zn2+ co-insertion/extraction are the most common reaction mechanisms for ZIBs with Mn-based oxide materials.135
5. Application of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials in supercapacitors
5.1. 2D nanostructured Mn-based oxides and their composites

5.1.1. 2D MnO. 
MnO has a high theoretical capacitance (∼1370 F g−1), which indicates its potential to apply in SCs and rechargeable MIBs.136 In 2013, MnO was for the first time prepared for SCs by Liao's group. To overcome the disadvantages of the poor conductivity and inferior long-term cycling stability of MnO, they designed vertically aligned graphene combined with MnO.137 Recently, Zhao et al. performed one-step fabrication of biomass-derived hierarchically porous carbon/MnO nanosheet composites (HPC–MnO). The obtained HPC–MnO composite materials were assembled in SSCs both as negative and positive electrodes, exhibiting excellent electrochemical performance. With the dried litchi shell, KOH and KMnO4 with a weight ratio of 1:3:0.3, the HPC–MnO-0.03 electrode delivered a substantially high specific capacitance of up to 795.5 F g−1 and 551.8 F g−1 as the positive and negative electrodes at 0.5 A g−1. Furthermore, the synthesized composite electrode achieved cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 93.5% after 5000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1.138 Huang et al. proposed that Ni nanoparticle decorated conductive metal oxides not only reduced the internal resistance, but also increased the specific capacitance. Meanwhile, the porous structure of the Ni/MnO nanosheet arrays gives rise to a larger contact area between the active material and the electrolyte. As a result, Ni-modified MnO nanosheet arrays exhibited an excellent high specific capacitance of 1235.6 F g−1 achieved at 0.5 A g−1 and a high rate capacity of 1075.6 F g−1 delivered at 10 A g−1.139


5.1.2. 2D MnO2. 
In 1999, Lee and Goodenough proposed MnO2 was an excellent material for faradaic electrochemical capacitors in aqueous electrolytes, which was considered to be a pioneering study on the pseudocapacitive behavior of MnO2.140 Over the past few decades, MnO2 has gradually become a promising electrode material for SCs due to its low cost, non-toxicity, large potential window, and high theoretical capacitance (1110 F g−1).106,141 However, further advancements of MnO2 electrodes are constrained by their extremely low electrical conductivity (10−7 to 10−8 S cm−1) and power density.142 In addition, the structure and different crystal forms of MnO2 also affect its electrochemical performance. Hence, extensive endeavors have been dedicated to developing MnO2-based nanocomposites and obtaining various nanostructures for improving the electrochemical performance and reaction kinetics.18
As we all know, MnO2 has several different crystal forms, and 2D nanostructured MnO2 materials composed of different crystal structures show extraordinary potential in the application for SCs.143 Based on a facile one-step enhanced chemical bath deposition (ECBD) method, a novel nanoarchitecture composed of γ-MnO2 nanosheets on conductive Sb-doped SnO2 nanobelts as the backbone has been prepared. The nanostructure achieved a specific capacitance of 162 F g−1 at a high current density of 20 A g−1, as well as good cycling stability.90 δ-MnO2 has a layered structure, which is considered to facilitate cation intercalation/deintercalation with little structural rearrangement during the charging and discharging process. As shown in Fig. 8a, an δ-MnO2–carbon composite was obtained based on the phase transformation from orthorhombic γ-MnO2. The result demonstrated that δ-MnO2 delivered a specific capacitance of 251.4 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, which is almost three times higher than that of the original orthorhombic phase.143 A high-energy ASC based on petal-shaped δ-MnO2 nanosheets and carbon nanotube-embedded polyacrylonitrile-based carbon nanofibers as the positive and negative electrodes was reported by Wang et al. The devices showed a specific capacitance of 93.99 F g−1 with a corresponding energy density of 52.22 W h kg−1 at 0.1 A g−1.144 Another research study suggested that a core–shell structure with directed growth of ultrathin parallel birnessite on β-MnO2 has great potential for application in high-performance ASCs.43

The ultrathin thickness (with thicknesses below 10 nm) of nanosheets affects the participation of materials in Faraday reactions, which further enables the devices to be much flexible.74 Ultrathin 2D nanosheets can display electrochemical properties completely different from their bulk counterparts. The main reason is that pseudocapacitors store charge only in the first few nanometers on the surface of the electrode material, while the ultrathin thickness of 2D nanosheets can maximize charge storage, fully utilize the intrinsically flat architecture and resolve the disadvantage of their low proton/ion conductivity.145 Therefore, ultrathin 2D nanosheets can be used for the construction of transparent and flexible devices. Chen's group prepared ultrathin Ni(OH)2–MnO2 hybrid nanosheet arrays on a macroporous Ni foam. Due to the hydrogen bonding interaction between MnO2 and Ni(OH)2 primary nanosheets, MnO2 primary nanosheets and Ni(OH)2 primary nanosheets can be randomly stacked and grown together to form hybrid nanosheets on Ni substrates. Furthermore, an ASC with a Ni(OH)2–MnO2 hybrid film as the positive electrode and porous freeze-dried reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as the negative electrode delivered a high energy density (186 W h kg−1 at 778 W kg−1).146 Huang et al. fabricated ultrathin MnO2 nanosheet arrays by a facile hydrothermal process. The low magnification TEM images of MnO2 nanosheets are shown in Fig. 8b, which proves the successful preparation of ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets. The representative high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of an individual MnO2 nanosheet indicates that the thickness of MnO2 is about 5 nm and the lattice spacing is 0.67 nm (Fig. 8c), corresponding to the crystal plane of the (001) plane of δ-MnO2. When MnO2 nanosheets have been investigated as the electrode of high-performance SCs, they showed a high specific capacitance of 595.2 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and excellent cycle stability.74 Wang et al. fabricated all-solid-state symmetrical micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) based on δ-MnO2 nanosheet ink, which was prepared by inkjet printing on glass and polyimide film substrates treated with O2 plasma. The thickness of δ-MnO2 nanosheets deposited on the silicon substrate is about 1 nm measured by using atomic force microscope (AFM) and TEM images of δ-MnO2 nanosheets as illustrated in Fig. 8d and e. Finally, MSCs delivered a high energy density of 1.8 × 10−4 W h cm−3 at a power density of 0.018 W cm−3 and good cycle stability with a capacitance retention of 88% after 3600 charge–discharge cycles.147 Wang's group synthesized ultrathin MnO2 nanomesh structures with a simple in situ redox reaction between KMnO4 solution and a sacrificial carbon template. The graphene-like birnessite MnO2 nanomesh possessed an enlarged specific surface area, extraordinary surface activity and a high specific capacitance of 516.7 F g−1.101
Widening the potential window has been proved an effective method to improve the energy density of SCs.148 A high-voltage (2.0 V) SC assembled with porous Cu-MOF@ultrathin δ-MnO2 nanosheets was prepared by Xu's group. The SC delivered a high capacitance of 340 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent cycle performance of 95% capacitance retention over 6000 cycles. Moreover, the curves of specific capacitance at current densities from 1 to 20 A g−1 and charge–discharge cycling tests of the Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets//AC ASC (Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2//AC ASC) in a neutral 1.0 M Na2SO4 solution are illustrated in Fig. 8f and g. The values of the specific capacitance of the Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2//AC ASC are nearly 1.5 times higher than those of the δ-MnO2//AC ASC.91 Generally, high energy capacity requires higher mass loading (higher than 5 mg), whereas high mass loading leads to the formation of a thick and dense layer of the active material, which adversely affects electron transmission.149 To overcome this limitation, Chodankar et al. designed carbon fiber (CF)-supported high-mass-loaded porous 2D-nanosheet-based MnO2@CF (6.6 mg cm−2) for use in high-energy solid-state ASCs. The assembled solid-state asymmetric battery showed an energy density of 2.305 mW h cm−3 at 50 mW cm−3 and the capacitance retention rate was 92.25% after 11000 cycles, while MnO2@CF and MoS2@CF were used as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. MnO2@CF and MoS2@CF nanosheets were fabricated via a single-step hydrothermal method for solid-state asymmetric SCs as depicted in Fig. 8h.150 The 2D MnO2 nanosheet network anchored on the 3D metal substrate of nanoporous Cu(NPC@MnO2) has attracted tremendous attention because of its high surface area, abundant pore voids and active sites. The schematic illustration of the preparation of the NPC@MnO2 composite is shown in Fig. 8i, and the porosity of NPC plays a key role in electrolyte penetration as well as ion transportation. Finally, NPC@MnO2 showed an excellent cycle stability with the capacity retention rate reaching 91.6% at 10 A g−1 after 10000 cycles. As depicted in Fig. 8j and k, NPC@MnO2 exhibits higher specific capacitance and superior rate ability to pure MnO2 at various scan rates and current densities.41 Due to the high surface area and chemical stability, titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanosheets are attractive substrates for MnO2.151 Zhu and co-workers fabricated tremella sheet-like MnO2 on exfoliated TiO2 nanosheets. A large specific surface area of 81.4 m2 g−1 and excellent specific capacitances 289.69 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 by 24 h growth were obtained.152
2D nanosheets tend to undergo re-stacking and agglomeration, which restrains ion and electron diffusion and results in the decrease of capacitance. Guo et al. fabricated NiMn oxide@MnO2 quasi-parallel arrays via assembling a 2D-on-2D structure in a Ni foam (NF) substrate through a hydrothermal method. MnO2 nanosheets uniformly grow on the surface of NiMn oxide arrays to well-constructed hybrid architectures that can significantly reduce the overlap of MnO2 nanosheets and improve ion diffusion. Moreover, the composites exhibited a high and long-cycle stable specific capacitance of 801 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and extraordinary cycling stability with 96% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles.153 Recently, the composites of MnO2 with a core–shell nanostructure have been extensively investigated.154,155 Especially, introducing new materials to form the core–shell structure of MnO2-based composites not only can obtain boosted specific capacitance, but the core–shell structure also acts as a support to stabilize the composites. Current reports based on some materials for constructing core–shell structure MnO2 composites mainly include TMOs, transition metal cobaltate, and transition metal molybdate.156–161 Li et al. designed sponge-like NiCo2O4/MnO2 ultrathin nanoflakes for SCs. The cross-linked ultrathin nanoflakes provide a fluffy sponge-like architecture to facilitate the electrolyte penetration into the inner electrodes. The as-synthesized electrode exhibited an enhanced specific capacitance of 935 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and ultra-long cycling stability maintaining 103.1% of initial capacitance after 25000 cycles.162 A hierarchical assembly of MnO2 nanosheets on CuCo2O4 nanoflakes was synthesized. The results suggested that the symmetric solid-state SC constructed with the optimized CuCo2O4–MnO2 hybrid structure achieved a high gravimetric capacitance of 181.3 F g−1 and an energy density of 64.1 W h kg−1 at a power density of about 1.5 kW kg−1.85 Similarly, core–shell arrays of layered CuCo2O4 nanosheets@MnO2 nanoflakes (CuCo2O4@MnO2 NSCs) for high-performance SCs were reported by Kuang et al. Electrochemical measurements that demonstrated they exhibited a high specific capacitance of 416 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and remarkable cycling stability with 92.1% retention after 4200 cycles.163 Huang et al. fabricated hierarchical Co3O4 nanowires@MnO2 nanosheet core–shell arrays on Ni foam for ASCs. Because of the unique design of the nanostructure, hierarchical Co3O4@MnO2 core–shell arrays exhibited a high specific capacitance of 560 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability with 95% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles.164 A 3D hierarchical CoMoO4@MnO2 core–shell nanostructure drew much attention owing to its desirable electrochemical properties. It exhibited a high specific capacitance of 2.27 F cm−2 at 3 mA cm−2 and excellent cycling stability with 93% retention of its initial specific capacitance after 3000 cycles.165 More information about the core–shell nanostructures of 2D MnO2 and its composites is listed in Table 3.

With the merits of the crystal structure and great electrochemical performance of 2D MnO2, it has gained extensive attention as an electrode material for SCs. Among the diverse crystal structures of MnO2, α-MnO2 with large tunnels and δ-MnO2 with a layered structure can obtain excellent electrochemical performance because of their large tunnels or interlayer spacing which can provide sufficient space to accommodate ion intercalation. Besides, appropriate measures can be chosen to synthesize ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets, which can further achieve the large interlayer spacing of δ-MnO2. Although 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials have received more interest with a wide potential window, it is still worth further exploration to select appropriate materials for compounding to obtain better performance.


5.1.3. 2D Mn2O3. 
Mn2O3, as another potential Mn-based oxide, has attracted widespread attention for application in biology, electrochemical sensors, photocatalysis, and LIBs.166 Recently, it has been presented as a good electrode material for SCs owing to the high specific capacity (theoretical specific capacity 1229 F g−1) and good electrochemical behavior.167 For example, 2D Mn2O3 nanowall films on Ni foam were designed by a facile hydrothermal route. The morphology of the synthesized Mn2O3 nanostructures was analyzed by FESEM, and the grown nanowalls presented a uniform morphology with an average thickness of ∼20–30 nm (Fig. 9a and b). Furthermore, Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy confirmed the formation of MnOx to Mn2O3 on the Ni foam, and it can be observed that the grown MnOx showed 54.5 atomic% Mn and 36.6 atomic% O element. The Mn2O3 nanowall electrode showed excellent electrochemical behavior because the arrangement and uniformity of the nanowalls were beneficial for facilitating the transport and diffusion of electrolyte ions during a fast charge–discharge process.168 It delivered a high specific capacitance of 461 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and an excellent energy density of 28.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1.7 kW kg−1, and a high power density of 22 kW kg−1 at an energy density of 7.6 W h kg−1 for SCs.75 Xu et al. fabricated porous Mn2O3 microsheet arrays on conductive nickel foam via a mild chemical reaction combined with a calcination process. The porous nanostructures possessed a high specific surface and tend to shorten the transport length of ions and charges in a practical electrochemical process.169 The as-prepared electrode material exhibited a high specific capacitance of 566.6 A g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, whereas the current density increases to 20 A g−1, and the capacitance decreased to 294.4 A g−1.170

However, the wide-range applications of Mn2O3 nanostructures are constrained by their poor conductivity.60 According to previous reports, coupling with suitable materials is an effective strategy to enhance the overall material properties of Mn2O3.171 Because compared with single-component materials, complex oxides can not only provide fast pathways and abundant electroactive surface sites for maximum electrochemical performance, but also make full use of the synergistic effect of different components to optimize electrode performance.172 Li's group fabricated a Mn2O3/CuxO core–shell heterostructure with Mn2O3 nanosheets attached to CuxO nanowires on copper foam as a binder-free electrode for flexible ASCs. The schematic diagram based on the synthesis process of Mn2O3/CuxO/copper foam electrodes is illustrated in Fig. 9c, and the synthesis steps involved in situ oxidation reactions combining calcination and hydrothermal processes. From electrochemical measurements, the Mn2O3/CuxO/copper foam-9 (hydrothermal reaction time of 9 h)//AC/NF SC exhibited a high energy density of 120.2 μW h cm−2 as the power density reaches 1.3 mW cm−2 as well as an outstanding cycle stability with 76.1% retention at 5 mA cm−2 after 10000 cycles. The integral area of diffusion-controlled (k2v1/2, pseudocapacitive) is 59.8% of the total area for the Mn2O3/CuxO/copper foam −9 electrode at 5 mV s−1 as shown in Fig. 9d.173 A 3D sponge-like porous structure of Mn2O3 tiny nanosheets grown on Ni(OH)2/Mn2O3 nanosheet arrays (NiMn@Mn-1 h) was prepared by a two-step hydrothermal method. The advantage of the structure is that the open channels result in the easy penetration of the electrolyte into the electrode, and the large specific surface area increases the active sites. As shown in Fig. 9e and f, the novel NiMn@Mn-1 h demonstrates an ultrahigh specific capacity (2274.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and a great cycling stability (capacitance retention of 87% at 5 A g−1 over 10000 cycles).42


5.1.4. 2D Mn3O4. 
Before 2013, there were few reports about 2D Mn3O4. Due to good stability, natural abundance and intrinsically high capacity, 2D Mn3O4 has been the focal point of much research in the last few years.174,175 Owing to the internal structural voids (tetrahedral voids and octahedral voids) and crystal structural defects, Mn3O4 can provide abundant active sites, which have broad application prospects in the application of SCs.176 For example, Zhang et al. prepared 2D Mn3O4 nanosheets by inducing nonionic surfactant micelles. Mn3O4 nanosheets for SCs had a remarkable specific capacitance of 127 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and the specific capacitance remained at 96% of the initial value even at 5 A g−1 after 10000 cycles, demonstrating an excellent performance for energy storage applications.177 Self-assembled and uniformly stacked Mn3O4 thin film nanosheets have been fabricated through a titanium (Ti) substrate by chemical bath deposition (CBD). In general, a common way of film formation is the adsorption of colloidal particles from solution onto a substrate. The Mn3O4 thin films were gradually deposited on the Ti substrate by a slow hydrolysis process of Mn in an aqueous solution of MnSO4 and the complex hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), and then the nanosheets were stacked perpendicular to the surface to reduce the surface energy. The stacked nanostructures exhibited a high specific capacitance of 398 F g−1 at a scan rate of 0.005 V s−1.178 Heteroatom (N, P, S, and B) co-doped carbon has been proved to further improve the electrical conductivity and cycling stability of carbon-based composites.179 Ding et al. developed a hierarchical flower-like Mn3O4@N, P-doped carbon (NPC) composite, which consisted of multi-intercalated Mn3O4 nanosheets and NPC cores. The fabrication process of hierarchical flower-like Mn3O4@NPC composites is shown in Fig. 10a. Attributed to its structural and dual-pseudocapacitive characteristics, the Mn3O4@NPC cathode offered a high specific capacitance of 370.8 F g−1 and outstanding rate performance.180 Novel CuO/Mn3O4 hierarchical nanoarrays grown on Cu foil as binder-free electrodes for high-performance SCs have been prepared. The oriented catalytic oxidation mechanism of CuO/Mn3O4 nanorod arrays can be explained as shown in Fig. 10b. The abundant CuO/Mn3O4 nanosheets are directionally modified on the surface of Cu(OH)2 nanorod arrays. Subsequently, by annealing treatment in an N2 atmosphere, CuO/Mn3O4 nanorod arrays are fabricated with tuned oxygen vacancies. The nanosheet-decorated CuO/Mn3O4 composite nanorod arrays acquired a high specific capacitance of 1732 F g−1 at 20 A g−1. The specific capacity at various current densities of N–CuO/Mn3O4 and cycling performance of N–CuO/Mn3O4 and N–CuO at 20 mA cm−2 are illustrated in Fig. 10c and d.181 Recently, in situ porous carbon-coated hexagonal Mn3O4 (p-Mn3O4@C) nanosheets were applied for screen-printed planar SCs, which has attracted extensive attention. p-Mn3O4@C displayed superior specific capacitance (386 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and exhibited an expanded voltage window of 0–1.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). As can be seen in Fig. 10e, p-Mn3O4@C obtained 90.4% capacitance retention at a current density of 10 A g−1 after 10000 charge/discharge cycles.182

5.1.5. 2D spinel MMn2O4 and MnM2O4. 
Spinel materials have a typical chemical formula of AB2O4, where cation A can be in an oxidation state of +2 or +4, and corresponding cation B can be in an oxidation state of +3 or +2. These possibilities can be expressed as A2+B23+X42− and A4+B22+X42−.67,183 Spinel structured Mn-based materials, such as MMn2O4 (including LiMn2O4, NiMn2O4, CoMn2O4, ZnMn2O4, and CuMn2O4) and MnM2O4 (MnCo2O4 and MnFe2O4), are very competitive electrode materials for SCs owing to their high-power delivering capability and better conductive character.184–188 2D nanostructured Mn-based spinel MnCo2O4 has been considered as a next generation energy storage material for SC applications since cobalt has a high oxidation potential and manganese has fast electron transport for electrochemical reactions.189 Besides, MnCo2O4 has gained great attention because of its high theoretical capacitance (∼3619 F g−1), low cost and natural abundance.183 Li et al. obtained MnCo2O4 nanosheets by a two-step hydrothermal method with post-annealing treatment. The rate performances of the MnCo2O4 electrode are 1600, 1900, 1750, 1500, 1300 and 1150 F g−1 at current densities of 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 A g−1, respectively.190 A novel and unique MnCo2O4 nanosheet porous 2D nanostructure has been proposed by a bottom-up process using graphene oxide (GO) as a sacrificial template. Moreover, the as-synthesized materials displayed a high specific energy density when applied as a positive electrode for a battery type SC, which delivered an exceptional energy density of 33.8 W h kg−1 at a power density of 318.9 W kg−1 and had high stability (a capacity retention of ∼85% after 10000 cycles).191 The Ni(OH)2 decorated spinel MnCo2O4 could efficaciously facilitate ion migration and provide an additional support for the intercalation/de-intercalation of ions during oxidation/reduction processes. Zhao et al. designed MnCo2O4@Ni(OH)2 multicomponent core–shell nanoflowers as hybrid electrode materials that exhibited a significantly enhanced specific capacitance of 2154 F g−1 at 5 A g−1, which is more than four times that of the individual MnCo2O4 electrode.189
CoMn2O4 nanosheets have been prepared by the transformation of a bimetallic (Mn, Co) carbonate precursor. When applied for SCs, they delivered a high specific capacitance of 1529 at 2 A g−1. A capacitance retention of 100% after 3000 cycles was achieved, revealing the cycling stability.79 NiMn2O4 has some strengths such as phenomenal conductivity, stability and relatively higher capacitance compared with single Mn-based oxide materials.192 Wei et al. fabricated NiMn2O4 nanosheet arrays grown on Ni foam as a novel electrode material for high-performance SCs. NiMn2O4 exhibited higher specific capacitances (662.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability (∼96% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles).78 3D flower-like nanostructures composed of NiMn2O4 nanosheets (NMO) were reported by Wei et al. The novel and environmentally friendly formation process of NiMn2O4 nanoflowers is analyzed in Fig. 11a. Low and high magnification FE-SEM images demonstrate a hierarchical 3D flower-like morphology with NMO nanosheets (Fig. 11b and c). A pouch-like HSC device was assembled with NiMn2O4 as a positive electrode and porous AC (PAC) as a negative electrode to further check the electrochemical behavior, which delivered a high energy density of 46.4 W h K g−1 and a power density of 5720 W kg−1. The long-term cycling stability and the first 5 cycle GCD curve of the NMO//PAC HSC device are illustrated in Fig. 11d, which exhibits high reversibility with a coulombic efficiency of 86% after 10000 cycles.193 Sun et al. fabricated a CNT@NiMn2O4 nanosheet core–shell composite. The as-prepared CNT@NiMn2O4 nanocomposite was used as the electrode material, which delivered a specific capacitance of 915.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. To access the resistance of charge transfer and electrolyte diffusion, pure and CNT@NiMn2O4 nanocomposites were measured (Fig. 11e). The calculated Rs of the nanocomposites is 0.19 Ω far below that of pure (3.3 Ω), which means that CNT@NiMn2O4 possesses a higher conductivity.194

5.2. 2D nanostructured Mn(OH)2 and LDHs
As one of the transition metal hydroxides, Mn(OH)2 is considered as a promising electrode material owing to its high specific capacitance, increased energy density, and high natural abundance.195,196 However, Mn(OH)2 materials are rarely studied for SCs, but broadly investigated as sacrificial templates and manganese sources to obtain Mn-based related oxides and derived oxides with the target morphology.197 Li and co-workers synthesized ultrathin multilayer Mn(OH)2 nanosheets. Subsequently, porous Fe2O3 nanoparticles as an anode and Mn(OH)2 nanosheets as a cathode on active carbon (AC) were assembled for a Mn(OH)2//Fe2O3 ASC (Fig. 12a). In electrochemical measurement, Mn(OH)2 exhibited a maximum capacitance of 3103 mF cm−2 (254.3 F g−1) at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. A comparison of the areal capacitances of Mn(OH)2 and Fe2O3 is shown as Fig. 12b. Furthermore, the Mn(OH)2//Fe2O3 ASC displayed excellent cycle stability maintaining 97.1% of the initial value after 8000 cycles, and almost in the whole process, coulombic efficiency holds 100% (Fig. 12c). As shown in the inset of Fig. 12c, by assembling two 1 × 1 cm−2 devices in series and charging the assembled device to 4 V, it can light 72 LEDs in parallel for about 2 min.95 A flexible ASC was fabricated with lamellar Mn(OH)2 nanosheets in situ growth on CuO-plated carbon cloth (CPCC@CuO@Mn(OH)2). From Fig. 12d, the 3D layered Mn(OH)2 nanosheet frame not only provides high capacitance, but also protects the CuO core and carbon fiber cloth substrate from damage, ensuring excellent energy storage and flexible function successfully. The flexible ASC of CPCC@CuO@Mn(OH)2//AC@CC delivered operating voltage close to 2.4 V and satisfactory cycle performance with an 88.9% capacity retention at the end of 10000 cycles. As shown in Fig. 12e and f, the GCD curves at 5 mA cm−2 are almost unchanged when the bending angle is 45, 90, and 135°, indicating that the SC has decent flexibility.196 Unique Cu2O@Mn(OH)2 core–shell hierarchical structures were prepared by using octahedral Cu2O as a template to support the growth of ultrathin Mn(OH)2 nanoflakes (Fig. 12g). Cu2O@Mn(OH)2 had a slightly larger specific surface area, which facilities effective electronic contact sites with the electrolyte. Therefore, the hierarchical structured electrode delivered an excellent specific capacitance of 647.2, 540.9, 453.3, 345.6, 309.5 and 227.8 F g−1 at different current densities of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 12h). To further explain the nanostructure successfully constructed, the TEM image of Cu2O@Mn(OH)2 is also shown in Fig. 12i, and the HRTEM image in the inset shows lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.24 nm, corresponding to the (101) plane of Mn(OH)2.195

Compared with Mn-based layered monometallic hydroxides, Mn-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have more desirable electrochemical performance due to their abundant redox reactions, high active surface area and 2D layered structure, which contains charge compensating anions and solvation molecules.198 Generally, LDHs consist of positively charged brucite-like host layers and hydrated exchangeable anions located in the interlayer gallery for charge balance, and are represented as the general formula [M1−x2+Mx3+ (OH)2](Ax/nn−)3·mH2O, where M2+ is a divalent cation (Mg2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, etc.), and M3+ is a trivalent cation (Al3+, Fe3+, Mn3+, Cr3+, etc.). An− is an interlayer anion (CO32−, SO42−, NO3−, Cl−, OH−, etc.), and x is the ratio of divalent to trivalent cations.199,200 A lot of reports related to Mn-based LDHs for SC applications have been published in recent years, such as NiMn LDHs, CoMn LDHs and ternary Ni–Co–Mn LDHs.86,201 Ultrathin nanoflakes of CoMn LDHs were designed by mixing Co(NO3)2 with Mn(NO3)2 aqueous solution in different molar ratios. Interestingly, with the molar ratio of Co2+/Mn2+ increasing gradually, the length of LDH nanosheets changed to some extent. The increased length of the nanoflakes provides good electronic conductivity, which reduces the intrinsic resistance of CoMn-LDH. In addition, the electrode exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 1062.6 F g−1 at 0.7 A g−1 when the molar concentration was 9:1.98 CoMn-LDH nanowalls were designed by in situ growth and demonstrated great potential as efficient electrodes for SCs. The as-prepared electrodes delivered a high specific capacitance (1079 F g−1 at 2.1 A g−1) and an excellent rate capability of 82.5% even at a high current density of 42 A g−1.202 The crystal structure of LDHs shows that metal atoms occupy the center of octahedra, and the hydroxyl group is at the edge. The octahedra share edges and form flat layers and excessive positive charge in the layer attracts anionic groups to the interlayer space. Therefore, the interlayer spacing will be affected by the size of the intercalated anionic groups.203 Using Co-ZIF-L as a sacrificial MOF template, Liu et al. investigated the effect of three different Mn salt solutions with different anionic groups and designed various CoMn-LDHs, namely CoMn-LDH-SO4, CoMn-LDH-NO3 and CoMn-LDH-Cl. Finally, the areal capacities of CoMn-LDH-SO4, -NO3 and -Cl were compared. Finally, CoMn-LDH-SO4 had demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance with an areal capacity of 582.07 mC cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2. Moreover, the capacity of CoMn-LDH-SO4 can well be maintained at 77% of its initial value after 5000 charge–discharge cycles at 10 mA cm−2.204 Although, due to the characteristics with rapid ion transfer reaction and 2D layered arrangement, LDHs have acquired some satisfactory reply. The poor cycling stability and rate reversibility of LDH-based electrodes are still a bottleneck because of the fragile and swelling nature of their layered structure.205 NiMn-LDH 3D flower-like hierarchical structures were synthesized through a self-assembly chemical co-precipitation strategy, which possessed a large active contact area and effective diffusion of protons and electrons, resulting improved capacitive stability. Benefiting from the favorable structural characters, the Ni–Mn LDHs showed an optimal capacitance value as high as 1379 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Furthermore, the flexible all-solid-state ASC delivered an energy and power density of 131.17 W h kg−1 and 1.45 KW kg−1, and was fabricated from Ni–Mn LDHs and active carbon as positive and negative electrode materials, respectively.206 Yang et al. firstly reported mesoporous Ni–Co–Mn hydroxide nanoflakes by a seed-assisted hydrothermal process for SCs. The improvement of the performance of SCs by the smart structure can be attributed to the inner Ni(OH)2 nanorod seeds acting as shorter electron transport paths, while the NCMH mesoporous nanoflakes facilitated a contact between the active material and the electrolyte. The ingenious design nanoarchitectures demonstrated outstanding electrochemical properties when used as binder-free electrodes for SCs, and the NCMH//AC ASC device operated at 1.5 V reached an energy density of 55.42 W h kg−1 at a power densities of 750 W kg−1.86 Zhong et al. reported ultrathin nanosheets of nickel–cobalt–manganese ternary carbonate hydroxide (NiCoMn-CH) coated on cobalt hydroxide nanowire arrays as a novel electrode material for SCs. The NiCoMn–CH ultrathin nanoflake electrode showed an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 3224 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and the capacity retention rate was 83.97% at 5 A g−1. Additionally, an outstanding cycle stability was demonstrated with a retention rate of 92.31% of the original capacitance after 6000 cycles.207
5.3. Other 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials
MnS with a layered structure is beneficial to promote the intercalation and deintercalation of electrolyte ions, which is important for the improvement of electrochemical capacitance properties.208 Zhang et al. incorporated surface sulfur vacancies into mesoporous γ-MnS nanosheets to obtain significantly improve the electrochemical capacitive performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that surface sulfur vacancies increase the number of charge carrier (OH−) adsorption sites and favored the diffusion of charge carriers (OH−). As illustrated in Fig. 13a, γ-MnS nanosheets with sulfur vacancies (MnS-SV) are prepared with 3D rGO as the template and electrodeposition combined with chemical reduction and post-annealing treatment of hydrazine. The specific capacitances of mesoporous γ-MnS nanosheets with sulfur vacancies on 3DrGO (3DrGO/MnS-SV), mesoporous γ-MnS nanosheets without sulfur vacancies on 3DrGO (3DrGO/MnS) and 3DrGO are compared in Fig. 13b, which delivered a specific capacitance of 933, 699, and 119 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively.209 The core–shell structure of a NiCo2S4@MnS (NCS@MS) composite on a CC substrate was designed by Zhang et al. The process mainly includes a needle array of the NiCo precursor in the hydrothermal reaction. Then, the MnS nanosheets were anchored on the array surface without destroying the morphology. NCS@MS/CC was employed as the working electrode in a three electrode system, and the composite delivered a high specific capacitance of up to 1908.3 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. An all-solid flexible ASC was assembled for the first time with NCS@MS/CC as the anode and AC/CC as the cathode, which exhibited an energy density of 23.3 W h kg−1 at a power density 725 W kg−1 and a maximum power density of 7.25 kW kg−1 with an energy density of 5.11 W h kg−1.210

Mn-MOFs as electrode materials for SCs can provide abundant Mn2+ metal-active centers for redox reactions and capacity to store and transport electrons and have attracted significant scientific interest.211 Yao's group reported intercalated and vertically co-oriented K0.5Mn2O4@Mn-MOF-8 nanosheet arrays through a facile hydrothermal method using K0.5Mn2O4 as both the template and the precursor. Fig. 13c shows the layered crystal structure of Mn-MOF, in which the chains of manganese ions are connected through 1,4-BDC oxygen atoms and transform [MnO6] into an octahedral geometry. From the discharge times of these electrodes, the specific capacitances of K0.5Mn2O4, K0.5Mn2O4@Mn-MOF-4, K0.5Mn2O4@Mn-MOF-6, K0.5Mn2O4@Mn-MOF-8, and K0.5Mn2O4@Mn-MOF-10 were calculated to be 387.5, 611, 704, 886.9, and 241.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 13d). The excellent performance dependent on smart strategy, which enhances the additional capacitance of electrode materials and introduces a large number of electrochemically active sites.212 Besides, Mn-based phosphides have been extensively explored in constructing high-performance SCs.213 Zhang et al. designed ultrathin porous Mn(PO3)2 nanosheets and MoO2 nanoparticles on N, P-dual heteroatom-doped graphene (NPG). The fabrication schematic of Mn(PO3)2/NPG cathode and MoO2/NPG anode assembled ASC devices is shown in Fig. 13f. Besides, Fig. 13e indicates that the Mn(PO3)2/NPG hybrid electrode showed an extraordinary specific capacity of 2073.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and good rate performance with a capacity retention rate of 77.8% from 1 A g−1 to 20 A g−1. Besides, the ASC showed an outstanding energy density of 96.2 W h kg−1 at a power performance of 726.73 W kg−1, and maintained 91.5% initial capacitance retention after 10000 cycles.214 Lithium-rich Li4Mn5O12 nanoflakes were first prepared by in situ by electrochemical oxidation of prefabricated Mn3O4 nanowalls. The prefabricated Mn3O4 nanowalls (NWs) consist of a large number of nanoplates, resulting in a large contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte, which facilitates the intercalation of lithium. The result indicated that potential windows for the Mn3O4 and Li4Mn5O12 electrodes could be expanded to 0–1.2 V (vs. Hg/Hg2Cl2) with an ideal specific capacitance of 527 and 627 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2, respectively. The schematic illustration of the electrochemical reaction process of the Li4Mn5O12 electrode on the atomic scale is shown in Fig. 13g.215 The different 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials and their composites for SCs are shown in Table 4.

In conclusion, 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials have attracted much attention due to a wide potential window and electrochemical activity. The redox of Mn2+/Mn3+/Mn4+ offers high redox potential and two-electron transfer, leading to high specific capacity. With the exception of the +4 oxidation state of Mn, which is the most stable oxidation state, Mn compounds with other possible lower oxidation states have also been explored as potential electrode materials for SC applications, such as with the lowest oxidation state (MnO, Mn(OH)2, MnCo2O4, and MnS), middle oxidation state (Mn2O3, NiMn-LDHs, CoMn-LDHs, CoMn2O4, and NiMn2O4), and mixed oxidation states (Mn3O4). However, the intrinsic low conductivity and Jahn–Teller distortion of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials limited the further application. Combining other materials to form composites is the primary strategy to achieve higher capacity and better performance of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials. Besides the high surface area, the good performance of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials is correlated with the availability of redox-active sites. Rational design of nanostructures is required to maximize the creation of redox active sites. Therefore, the construction of 3D nanostructures with open channels to couple high pseudocapacitance is necessary, such as mesoporous structures, 3D nanoflowers with 2D nanosheets and core–shell nanoarrays.
6. Application of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials for metal-ion batteries
Rechargeable batteries can realize repeated conversion between electrical energy and stored chemical energy, which meets the stringent requirements for various electronic devices better than unrecyclable primary batteries.216 Rechargeable MIBs (LIBs, SIBs, ZIBs, etc.), highlighted by fascinating features such as high energy density, long cycling life and environmental friendliness, are generally accepted as one of the most important electronic devices to accommodate the growing demands for EES.217,218 However, nanostructured and porous materials usually lead to low tap density due to the presence of void space between the nanoparticles.40 For the same mass loading, low tap density causes low volumetric capacity, thicker electrodes and a longer electron pathway, which will hinder the achievement of high energy density of electrode materials for alkali MIBs.219,220 Furthermore, the irreversible loss from the cathode material during the first cycles of rechargeable alkali MIBs notably reduces the overall cell capacity, which mainly can be attributed to the irreversibility of the structural changes of electrode materials.221 The reversible intercalation of ions results in the expansion and contraction of electrode materials, which will result in the loss of batteries and further lead to capacity loss.222 Besides, the issue of the long term stability of electrode materials degrades storage batteries quickly, thus leading to the need for replacement after limited cycles.223
6.1. Lithium-ion batteries
Among all ion batteries, LIBs have been considered a significant research material of energy storage since their successful commercialized by Sony Corporation in the 1990s.224 Furthermore, the promulgation of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded in 2019 is a great affirmation of research achievements of LIBs.225 Among all materials of anodes for LIBs, 2D nanostructured Mn-based nanomaterials have been extensively explored because of ample active sites and unobstructed channels for fast insertion/extraction of Li+ ions.226,227 Interconnected porous MnO nanoflakes on nickel foam were prepared by the reduction of a hydrothermal synthesized MnO2 precursor in hydrogen. The porous MnO nanoflakes retained a capacity of 708.4 mA h g−1 in the 200th charge/discharge cycle and delivered a capacity of 376.4 mA h g−1 at a current density as high as 2.46 A g−1.228 Dang et al. assembled 3D honeycomb-like heterogeneous networks composed of ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets on carbon spheres. From the scheme of the synthesis process of ultrathin nanosheets and their multilevel assembles (Fig. 14a), the ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets are uniformly coated on the surface of carbon spheres assembled into ordered 3D arrays as templates. When honeycomb-like macroporous structures were evaluated as an anode material for LIBs, which can achieve a high capacity of 600.4 mA h g−1, 445.8 mA h g−1, 352.3 mA h g−1 and 263 mA h g−1 at current rates 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 A g−1, respectively. The FESEM images with different magnifications of hollow MnO2 spheres composed of ultrathin nanosheets can be seen in Fig. 14b and c.89 Hierarchical heterostructure hollow spheres of Co3O4 nanocrystals grown on ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets were fabricated (Fig. 14e). The Li storage characteristics of the MnO2/Co3O4 electrode are illustrated in Fig. 14d. The highlight of the architecture is that Co3O4 nanocrystals are exposed to the electrolyte directly and can fully participate in the electrochemical reaction, so the Li-ion diffusion distance is short, accelerating the kinetics of the electrochemical reactivity. Furthermore, the cycling performance of the as-prepared MnO2/Co3O4, and pure MnO2 and Co3O4 nanoparticle electrodes at 0.4 A g−1 is shown in Fig. 14f. In the second cycle, the Co3O4 nanoparticle electrode shows the highest discharge capacity of 1237.7 mA h g−1, which is higher than that of MnO2/Co3O4 (1123.1 mA h g−1).229 Nevertheless, most TMOs are limited by reversible capacity and suffer from capacity fading mainly because of poor electronic conductivity, sluggish chemical kinetics and dendritic metal growth, which are the main bottleneck problems for developing LIBs.230 To overcome the problems, Pan et al. designed a novel 1/2D hybrid architecture for high-capacity, reversible lithium storage by incorporating SnO2 with high intrinsic conductivity as a spacer to prevent the MnO2 nanosheets from restacking. The detailed preparation of MnO2 nanosheets and SnO2 nanowires is shown in Fig. 14g. The cycling behaviors of SnO2/MnO2, MnO2 nanosheets and SnO2 nanowires, as well as the rate capabilities of SnO2/MnO2 are shown in Fig. 14h and i. The hybrid structure provided strikingly high reversible capacities of 862 mA h g−1 and 709 mA h g−1 at 0.1 and 0.2 A g−1 after the end of 200 cycles. Moreover, at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 A g−1, the reversible capacities remained at 1120, 889, 746, 659 and 544 mA h g−1, respectively.231 Hierarchical MnOx-based nanorods consisting of interconnected MnO2 nanosheets grown on carbon-coated MnO nanorods were prepared by Zheng et al. The nanocomposite delivered outstanding lithium-storage capabilities with a reversible specific capacity of 919.2 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 100 cycles and a high specific capacity of 1243.2 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after long-term cycles for 900 cycles.232 Su and co-workers investigated the electrochemical performance of hierarchical Mn2O3 hollow microspheres with nanosheets as cathode materials for LIBs. Hierarchical Mn2O3 hollow microspheres demonstrated a good rate capability, such as a specific capacity of 422 mA h g−1 at a current density as high as 16 A g−1 and delivered a high reversible capacity of 580 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with a high coulombic efficiency of about 99.7% after 140 cycles.233 The morphology and sheet thickness of Mn(OH)2 as the precursor could be tuned by controlling the ethylene glycol/H2O volume ratio, resulting the morphology preservation of the porous Mn2O3 nanomaterials. Furthermore, a Mn2O3 flower-like structure with stacked porous nanoplates was acquired via calcination at 600 °C. Fig. 15a shows the formation process of the porous Mn2O3 architecture and its advantages in enhanced lithium storage performance. In electrochemical tests, the prepared Mn2O3 nanomaterials delivered the best performance of 690 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1.166 The diffusion of Li+ in the electrodes is the rate-limiting process that determines the output energy density of the batteries. An effective strategy to shorten the ion distance and improve the Li+ diffusion kinetics in electrode materials is optimizing structures.234 Pan et al. prepared ultrathin Cu2O–Mn3O4 nanosheets (CM–GS composites) through a hydrothermal route and a subsequent calcination process. Investigated as anodes for LIBs, the porous architectures of CM–GS composites could achieve an initial discharge and charge capacity of 1257 and 918 mA h g−1. After 350 cycles at 2.5 A g−1, it exhibited a high reversible capacity of 792 mA h g−1 with 120% capacity retention, showing excellent cycling stability and excellent rate performance.235

In the past few years, 2D lithium manganese oxide materials have been extensively investigated as a candidate for anode active materials of great potential due to their excellent electrochemical performance. The common lithium manganese oxides can be divided into two categories: one is layered frameworks with 2D open network structures represented by LiMnO2 and Li2MnO3, and the other is spinel type frameworks (such as LiMn2O4) with 3D Li+ diffusion pathways.236 LiMn2O4 is regarded as a capable cathode material instead of LiCoO2 for LIBs due to its environmental friendliness, easy synthesis methods and high rate capability.28,237 LiMn2O4 thin films were reported via sintering an electrodeposited Mn3O4 precursor on an Au substrate by Quan's group. From electrochemical measurements, the LiMn2O4 thin film was confirmed to have a high lithium diffusion coefficient of 10−9 to 10−11 cm2 s−1 and showed superior cycle performance without capacity fading for 500 cycles when discharge current density varied from 10 mA cm−2 to 300 mA cm−2.238 However, the practical applications of LiMn2O4 are distinctly affected by its capacity decay, poor cycling stability and Jahn–Teller distortion at high current densities.239 To obtain advanced electrochemical performance, nanoporous LiMn2O4 nanosheets composed of single-crystalline LiMn2O4 nanorods via a calcination process were reported. The highly oriented crystallinity, 2D nanoporous and exposed {111} facet endowed porous single-crystalline LiMn2O4 nanosheets with durable cycling performance and high capacity retention as a cathode for LIBs. From the electrochemical data, there is almost no loss of the initial capacity after 500 cycles at a discharge rate of 1C, and the capacity retention was about 86% of the initial capacity after 500 cycles at a discharge rate of 25C.240 An interesting hydrothermal lithiation process was developed for the formation of layered-spinel lithium manganate hydrate (LHMO-LS) with hierarchical 2D nanosheets. From Fig. 15b, it can be seen that the high reversible capacity and good high rate performance of LHMO-LS can be mainly attributed to the hydrated layered phase of the 2D Li-ion diffusion channel improving the ion transport kinetics and the spinel phase of the 3D Li-ion transfer path possessing a stable structural framework. In addition, the disorder of the interface and structure also inhibited the volume change and enhanced the electrochemical capacity. Eventually, the charge–discharge profiles at 20 mA g−1 for LHMO-L (layered lithium manganate hydrate), LHMO-LS and LMO-S (spinel anhydrous lithium manganate) electrodes are compared in Fig. 15c, and their highest discharge capacities are 223.6 mA h g−1, 220.3 mA h g−1 and 265.1 mA h g−1, respectively. Furthermore, the LHMO-LS electrode also provided the best rate capability of 212.2 and 139.9 mA h g−1 at 0.3 and 9 A g−1 (Fig. 15d).77 LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 is a derivative of LiMn2O4 with a highly stable discharge potential of around 4.7 V (vs. Li/Li+) and a high energy density approaching 650 W h kg−1. Unfortunately, the application of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 is hindered by its poor cycle and rate performance.241 An effective strategy was proposed by Tan et al. They chose butyric anhydride (BA) as an effective functional additive to the electrolyte, which can effectively suppress the decomposition of the electrolyte and transition metal dissolution during the cycling process. The results proved that the capacity retention and rate performance of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Li battery were significantly improved.242 Hierarchical 2D LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 nanosheets are favorable for electrochemical reactions because of their intriguing structure. Hierarchical flower-like pure spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 nanosheets have been reported via a template-orientated strategy as a high-performance cathode for LIBs. Fig. 15e illustrates the preparation process of the hierarchical spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 nanosheets. The as-prepared high-voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 presented an initial capacity of 138.5 mA h g−1 at 1C due to the unique porous structure that maximizes the active sites and ensures shortened ion/electron diffusion channels, as evidenced by the Li+/e− transfer mechanism. Furthermore, the high-voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode showed excellent cycling stability and high reversible lithium storage at 10C. It delivered a discharge capacity of 122.0 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of about 92.29% over 300 charge/discharge cycles and an efficiency of almost 100%.243 3D hierarchical LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 desert-waves (LNMO-DW) composed of primary 2D nanodiscs (ND) were designed as advanced cathodes for LIBs. 2D LNMO-ND, 3D LNMO-DW and 3D LNMO-microspheres (MSs) can be synthesized controllably by precisely adjusting the hydrazine hydrate dosage. Finally, 3D hierarchical LNMO-DW revealed more advantages in electrochemical performance and great application prospects, which can be attributed to the uninterrupted 3D desert-wave-like structure contributing to the rapid migration of electrons and realizing unimpeded transmission. In addition, the uniform quasi-circular nanodiscs could shorten the diffusion distance of Li+ and provided excellent conductivity and mobility. Impressively, a high discharge capacity of 130 mA h g−1 and outstanding cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 91% after 200 cycles at 10C can be acquired.87 Besides, the diverse 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials and their composites for LIBs are shown in Table 5.

6.2. Sodium-ion batteries
The relative abundance of lithium in the earth's crust leads to an inflation of the cost of lithium materials.12 Compared with lithium, the sodium content in the earth's crust is as high as about 2.75 wt%, so the abundance and low cost of sodium can be an advantage for large-scale energy storage applications.244 Sodium is located below lithium and belongs to the same main group in the periodic table and thus has similar chemical properties in many respects, which has brought unprecedented attention to SIBs.245 However, compared to LIBs, there are some challenges before the commercialization of SIBs becomes a reality. For example, Na has a lower gravimetric capacity than Li (1165 vs. 3829 mA h g−1) and is less reducible than Li (−2.71 V vs. SHE, compared to −3.04 V), and dendrite formation during Na-metal deposition is more complex than that with Li metal anodes.246 Thus, recently, enormous effort has been devoted to the anode or cathode materials of SIBs. The development of Mn-based materials has been evoked for SIBs in the past few decades; for instance, Su et al. synthesized α-MnO2 and β-MnO2 nanorods by a hydrothermal method, and they achieved high initial Na ion storage capacities of 278 mA h g−1 and 298 mA h g−1, respectively.52 Although Mn-based materials have attracted unprecedented attention, only a few studies about 2D nanostructured Mn-based anode or cathode materials have been reported.
The morphology and crystal structure of δ-MnO2 with alkali cations (A-δ-MnO2, A = K+, Na+) as a cathode material for SIBs have been investigated by Liu's teamwork. The hierarchical nanostructure exhibited better rate performance and more stable cycling performance.247 Hierarchical layered K0.27MnO2 microflowers were first prepared via a topochemical reaction process. After 100 cycles, a reversible capacity of 68.5 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 was attained in a full cell with K0.27MnO2 as the cathode and NaTi2(PO4)3 as the anode.248 A layered sandwich framework 3D MxMnO2 (M = Li, Na, K, Co, and Mg) composed of MnO2 nanosheets was prepared through a bottom-up strategy by Lu et al. The interlayer spacing between MnO2 nanosheets can be enlarged to intercalate/extract guest cations, which may be caused by the hydration of the cations. The NaxMnO2 electrode exhibited a better electrochemical cycling stability and retained about 73% of the initial capacity after 500 cycles.249
NaxMnO2 (0 < x ≤ 1) is an ideal material due to the larger ionic size difference between alkaline and transition metals, which drives the segregation of Na and Mn into alternating layers.250 Generally, for NaxMnO2, a tunnel structure, a layered structure and a mixture (tunnel and layered) structure are formed between 0.22 ≤ x ≤ 0.44, 0.66 < x ≤ 1 and 0.44 < x ≤ 0.66, respectively.251 However, previous reports have focused more on the phase transformation and structural changes of NaxMnO2 cathodes, but less on the morphology.252 Na0.44MnO2 has a tunnel structure, so one dimensional Na0.44MnO2 nanorods and nanowires have been reported widely because of their large tunnel structure suitable for Na+ ion accommodation.253,254 Unfortunately, for the crystal structure of Na0.44MnO2, the [001] (c-axis) direction is the main path for sodium diffusion and growth direction, so longer nanorod or nanowire samples may hinder the fast Na ion transport properties.255 In order to avoid extensive elongation in one direction and obtain a homogeneous morphology, Li et al. reported a novel sol–gel method to obtain an extended (001) surface of 2D Na0.44MnO2 nanoplates by controlling the crystal growth-restricted morphology along the c-axis direction using home-made internal polystyrene. As a result, the material obtained superior rate capability and cycling stability, such as 96 mA h g−1 discharge capacity at 10C and 97.8% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.5C.256 Furthermore, For Na+ ion diffusion in a layered structure, the diffusion barrier is highly dependent on the interlayer spacing. Xia et al. converted Mn3O4 nanowall arrays into four samples with Na0.46MnO2−y(OH)2y·0.61H2O(S1), Na0.71MnO2−y(OH)2y·0.32H2O(S2), NaMnO2−y(OH)2y·0.10H2O(S3), and NaMnO2−y−δ(OH)2y(S4) via hydrothermal treatment. From the sodium storage performances of S1–S4 samples, the S4 electrode showed superior rate performance and delivered a large reversible capacity of 156.0 mA h g−1 at a very high current rate of 50C. In addition to the ultra-thin nanosheet morphology, a new polymorph consisting of H′3 and O′3 stacking of the S4 sample effectively further enhances its rate performance and cycle performance for Na ion storage. The reason can be explained as the coexistence of H′3 stacking with eight-coordinate sites and O′3 stacking with six-coordinate sites in the layered structure, and the monoclinic structure retained a large interlayer distance as birnessite even when crystal water was completely removed from the interlayer.257
6.3. Multivalent-ion batteries
Because multiple electrons are involved in redox reactions, multivalent-ions (e.g. Mg2+, Zn2+, and Al3+) can obtain higher specific capacity and energy density than single ion batteries in principle.258 Rechargeable Mg-ion batteries have attracted rising interest due to the natural abundance of Mg resources and safety.259 Liu et al. prepared flower-like structure δ-MnO2 with a highly porous morphology formed from intersecting nanoflakes. MnO2 nanoflowers showed a high capacity of 252.1 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1 as a cathode material for Mg storage.260 To obtain higher conductivity, Zhang et al. designed a core–shell structure with δ-MnO2 and carbon molecular sieves (δ-MnO2@CMS) as the cathode and VO2 nanowires as the anode for aqueous magnesium ion batteries. Finally, the device delivered a reversible capacity of 112.2 mA h g−1.261
ZIBs have attracted tremendous interest as the most favorable electrode materials since the Zn anode inexpensiveness, environmental benignity, low redox potential (−0.76 V vs. SHE) and a gravimetric capacity of 820 mA h g−1.258,262 Because aqueous electrolytes provide two orders of magnitude higher ionic conductivity (∼1 S cm−1) than non-aqueous electrolytes (∼1–10 mS cm−1) and a higher safety, aqueous rechargeable batteries have been seen a promising class of multivalent-ion batteries.17 Aqueous ZIBs (AZIBs) composed of zinc anode and cathode materials (such as manganese-based oxides, Prussian blue analogs, and vanadium-based oxides) and a zinc containing aqueous electrolyte form a viable alternative energy storage system, in which manganese-based oxides have been one of the most promising cathode materials for AZIBs.263 The different 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials and their composites as cathodes for ZIBs are shown in Table 6.

MnO2 has been the most attractive cathode material for ZIBs in recent few years because of its high voltage platform of about 1.4 V (vs. Zn2+/Zn) and high theoretical capacity (308 mA h g−1).264,265 For instance, aerogel-structured MnO2 (A-MnO2) assembled from defect-rich ultrathin nanosheets was fabricated by Li's group. Interestingly, V2O5 gel was added during the synthesis of the A-MnO2 material. Due to the formation of a large number of oxygen vacancies induced by V doping, A-MnO2 significantly improved the electrochemical performance of ZIB cathodes such as capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability. Besides, the schematic of the energy storage mechanism of the A-MnO2 cathode can be explained as shown in Fig. 16a, and reversible formation/dissolution of Zn4SO4(OH)6·4H2O flakes occurs as a side reaction on the A-MnO2 cathode. The flexible device could deliver an areal capacity of 0.24 mA h cm−2 at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2, corresponding to an energy density of 0.32 mW h cm−2.266 However, the low thermal stability of oxygen deficient MnO2 with cation doping is prone to trigger phase transformation into Mn3O4.267 In order to maintain its original phase structure, Zhao and co-workers proposed anionic S doping MnO2 (S-MnO2), which is an alternative strategy to enhance electrochemical performance that is explained by the substitution of a lower electronegativity non-metal element for high electronegativity oxygen in MnO2. As shown in Fig. 16b, compared with MnO2, S-MnO2 displays better rate performance from 0.2 to 2 A g−1. In addition, the cycling performance of MnO2 and S-MnO2 electrodes at 0.2 A g−1 is in striking contrast (Fig. 16c). The S-MnO2 electrode showed outstanding durability and delivered a high specific capacity of 320 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, and its coulombic efficiency approached 100%.268 Chen et al. chose carbon nanofibers (CNFs) as a substrate to fabricate hierarchical core–shell CNF@MnO2 nanosheets (MOC) to maintain the conductive network with minimized volume variation. The preparation process of composites is illustrated in Fig. 16d. Furthermore, the composite cathode exhibited extraordinary electrochemical performance in aqueous ZIBs, recovering a high capacity of 221 mA h g−1 after 700 cycles at 0.2 A g−1. The cycling performance of MOC-5, MOC-15 (the weight ratio of KMnO4/CNF is 5:1 and 15:1) and pure MnO2 (MO) at 3 A g−1 is illustrated in Fig. 16e; obviously, MOC-5 delivered the highest reversible capacity and capacity retention. As shown in Fig. 16f, the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) of MOC-5 exhibited low overvoltage values in both two discharge steps, demonstrating its small charge transfer resistance and fast ion diffusion.269 Recently, a hollow composite heterostructure electrode material Co3V2O8@MnO2 was obtained by a simple hydrothermal method. As shown in Fig. 16g, MnO2 nanoflakes were grown in situ on a Co3V2O8 hexagonal plate, resulting in the final formation of a hollow composite heterostructure, and the hollow structure can largely prevent the volume shrinkage/expansion and delay the irreversible structural dissolution of MnO2 during the cycling process. Benefiting from the above, the Co3V2O8@MnO2 cathode for ZIBs delivered a phenomenal high discharge capacity of 245.4 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and the discharge capacity was about 140.0 mA h g−1 at 0.3 A g−1 after 300 cycles. Long-term cycling properties at 0.3 A g−1 and the contribution ratios of the capacitive capacities and diffusion-limited capacities of Co3V2O8@MnO2 electrodes are provided in Fig. 16h and i.270

Although directly using 2D MnO2 nanosheets as cathode materials for AZIBs can increase the discharge capacity and cycling stability to a certain extent, the dissolution of structural components in the electrolytes and the formation of side reaction products result in lower capacity and unsatisfactory rate performance.61 Recently, a new idea is proposed by Yang et al. to improve cycle stability. They presented a one-pot electrochemical potential-cycle exfoliation approach of producing 2D few-layered δ-MnO2. The mechanism of electrochemical potential cyclic exfoliation with non-van der Waals of 2D Na-birnessite in NaOH (10 M) aqueous solution is shown in Fig. 17a. When the potential is higher than 0.1 V, some surface atoms of Mn metal dissolve into MnO42−, which is reduced to an ultrathin layer of birnessite due to its instability in strong alkaline solution. When the potential value is lower than −0.9 V, hydrated cations ([Na·n(H2O)]+) intercalate into the interlayers of layered birnessite, followed by intensive gas evolution generated by co-intercalated water redox, which leads to progressive expansion and eventual exfoliation of layered birnessite. When used as a cathode material for ZIBs, the 2D Na-birnessite delivered a capacity of 325 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and achieved a capacity retention of 84% over 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1.271 Considering stacking or aggregation of layered MnO2, inverse opal MnO2 (IO-MnO2) constructed from few-layered ultrathin nanosheets through a solution template method was designed by Ren's group. Interestingly, polystyrene (PS) templates could separate the nanosheets effectively, preventing stacking or aggregation. The results of the electrochemical performance of IO-MnO2 AZIBs demonstrate a high specific discharge capacity of 262.9 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.3 A g−1. The long-term cycling performance at a high current density of 2 A g−1 showed high stability with a high discharge capacity of 121 mA h g−1 even after 5000 cycles.61 Metal cation or organic molecule pre-intercalation is another dominant strategy to enlarge the interlayer space. Moreover, noncovalent bonds are formed between pre-intercalation cations and interlayer oxygen atoms to reduce the distortion of the crystal structure.272 Xie et al. investigated alkali ion (Li+, Na+, or K+) pre-intercalation of δ-MnO2 nanosheets (X-δ-MnO2) for high-capacity and stable ZIBs. The rate capability and cycling stability of X-δ-MnO2 at 0.3 A g−1 are depicted in Fig. 17b and c. It suggested that the cycling stability, the rate capability, and the reversibility of X-δ-MnO2 are improved in the sequence of K-δ-MnO2 > Na-δ-MnO2 > Li-δ-MnO2 owing to the increase of the pre-intercalated ion radius.273 Recently, Wang et al. used pre-intercalated Sn4+ ions with MnO2 and obtained a SnxMnO2/SnO2 heterostructure by a one-step hydrothermal method. These modifications provided sufficient hetero-interfaces and expanded the interlayer spacing in the material, which greatly facilitated the insertion/extraction of Zn2+. The energy storage mechanism of the SnxMnO2/SnO2 cathode is the co-insertion/extraction of Zn2+ and H+ and is depicted in Fig. 17d. The working principle of a ZIB with a SnxMnO2/SnO2 cathode is also shown in Fig. 17e. The SnxMnO2/SnO2 cathode has no obvious capacity decay at 0.3 A g−1 after 100 cycles, whereas MnO2 shows a much lower capacity retention rate of only 79.3% (Fig. 17f).274 Intercalating a guest polymer into MnO2 to strengthen the extended layered structure is an effective way to repress the capacity fading of the MnO2 cathode. Thus, Huang's team designed polyaniline (PANI)-intercalated MnO2 nanolayers through a simple one-step inorganic/organic interface reaction. The co-insertion mechanism of H+ and Zn2+ in PANI-intercalated MnO2 nanolayers is explained in Fig. 17g. During the first discharge platform, H+ intercalated into polyaniline (PANI) intercalated MnO2 nanolayers dominates the electrode reaction. With the decrease of H+ concentration around the electrode, Zn2+ insertion dominates the electrochemical reaction, the second discharge platform and the formation of zinc hydroxide sulfate on the electrode surface. The PANI-intercalated MnO2 nanolayers exhibited a reversible specific capacity of 280 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 200 cycles, which benefited from the expansion of interlayer spacing to provide more ionic transport channels. The schematic illustration of the expanded intercalated structure of polyaniline (PANI)-intercalated MnO2 nanolayers is illustrated in Fig. 17h.275 Similarly, MnO2–PANI hybrid networks with a carbon cloth support (PANI–MnO2/CC) were reported by Ruan's et al. The synthesis process mainly includes in situ deposition of MnO2 networks on CC, followed by self-initiated polymerization to form PANI protective/active layers with a 3D network-like interface, which could effectively promote the charge transport ability of composites to achieve high rate performance (Fig. 17i). The electrochemical test results showed that PANI–MnO2/CC with 5 min polymerization (PANI–MnO2-5/CC) delivered the best electrochemical performance (286 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and an outstanding capacity of 158 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of 96.9% at a high current density of 4.0 A g−1 after a long-term examination for 9000 cycles.276

Rechargeable MIBs have the advantage of high energy density over SCs, especially multivalent ion batteries with multi-electron transport capability, and they can provide higher capacity compared to monovalent ion batteries. Although 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials and their composite LIB electrode materials have received extensive attention in the early years, research has mainly focused on 2D spinel LiMn2O4 and its derivatives. Therefore, future research should focus on expanding the application of manganese-based compounds. Similar to LIBs, the current research on ZIBs based on 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials is very monotonous, and reports are limited to MnO2. Other 2D nanostructured Mn-based compounds deserve attention to improve their deficiencies. In addition, the research on 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials for SIBs is less, mainly focusing on the structure, and the synthesis of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials deserves attention.
7. Strategies of improving the electrochemical properties of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials
Although 2D nanostructured Mn-based electrode materials have made much remarkable progress in SCs and rechargeable MIBs, there are still some obstacles to overcome in order to adapt to future practical applications, such as poor conductivity and the dissolution of Mn2+ ions.277 In the above we have summarized some suggestions for optimizing 2D nanosheets or constructing 3D structures. Here, to alleviate the dissolution, improve the conductivity and strengthen the structural stability, some functionalized modifications are necessary. The corresponding graphical abstract of modification strategies is shown in Fig. 18. In addition to the material itself, the electrolyte is also the main factor affecting the electrochemical performance.

Generally, ZnSO4 and Zn(CF3SO3)2 solutions are common electrolytes. Zhang et al. investigated the electrochemical properties of a spinel ZnMn2O4 cathode in 3 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 and ZnSO4 electrolytes. In contrast, the Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte suggested a decrease in overpotential during cycling, while ZnSO4 showed a significantly larger overpotential and an increase in the separation of charge and discharge voltages, indicating a higher energy efficiency in Zn(CF3SO3)2. The excellent electrochemical properties of Zn(CF3SO3)2 could be attributed to the bulky CF3SO3− anions (versus SO42− with double charge) that decrease the number of water molecules surrounding Zn2+ cations and reduce the solvation effect, facilitating Zn2+ transportation and charge transfer. In the pure ZnSO4 electrolyte, layered-type MnO2 suffers from serious capacity decay after few cycles, which can be attributed to the incomplete oxidation of the dissolved Mn2+ during discharging and the formation of Znx(SO4)y(OH)z·nH2O. Adding inorganic salts containing Mn2+ ions into the electrolyte has been demonstrated an effective means to alleviate Mn2+ ion dissolution from MnO2. Because Mn2+ ions dissolution equilibrium can be tailored and the reversibility of MnO2 can be improved.278

7.1.1. Graphene-based composites. 
The low conductivity and poor cycling stability of Mn-based materials have seriously limited their application. As we all know, carbon-based materials have good electrical conductivity, high stability and mechanical flexibility. Therefore, to improve the poor conductivity of Mn-based materials and overcome the crystal expansion/contraction induced flaking off during repeated cycling processes, a series of carbon materials such as graphene and CNTs as promising materials have been incorporated into Mn-based materials.279 The integration of carbon materials into a Mn-based material can serve as a 3D electron transfer network and generate a large number of available active sites to adsorb/desorb electrolyte ions, thereby facilitating electrolyte ion transportation and yielding enhanced reaction kinetics.280
Among many carbon-based materials, graphene is one of the most competitive materials because of its excellent electrical conductivity, large theoretical surface area (∼2630 m2 g−1, graphene monolayer), high flexibility and good chemical and thermal stability.281–283 An intimate contact of Mn-based materials and graphene is desired, because graphene facilitates electronic conduction and can act as an auxiliary material to control the morphology on its surface, which benefits reaction kinetics and utilization.284 For example, Chen and colleagues developed nanoscale MnO2 that is uniformly distributed and tightly anchored to graphene. Only 1 wt% graphene incorporation can significantly increase the specific capacitance (from 215 to 365 F g−1) of the MnO2 electrode.285 Feng et al. prepared novel MnO2 petal nanosheet/graphene composites via a one-step hydrothermal method. It showed a remarkable specific capacity of 516.8 F g−1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 in a 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, suggesting its possible application as a remarkable electrode material for high-performance SCs.286 Yang et al. prepared nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) ultrathin MnO2 sheet composites via a facile hydrothermal method. Due to the presence of pyrrolic nitrogen and pyridine nitrogen in graphene, NG improves the capacity and rate performance, while maintaining the excellent cycling performance of the SC.287 Cui et al. reported monolayer vertical MnO2-nanosheet covered Mn3O4 octahedrons anchored in 3D NG networks as an electrode for SCs. The detailed schematic illustration of the synthetic process of Mn3O4/MnO2–NG is shown in Fig. 19a. Two-step optimization realized highly effective synergy between Mn3O4/MnO2 nanoarchitectures and double electric layer NG, in which the first step was obtaining monolayer standing MnO2-nanosheet covering and the second step was achieving good dispersion of high number-density Mn3O4/MnO2 in a 3D interconnected NG network. Eventually the composites delivered a high specific capacitance of 739 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and excellent cycle stability of 93.4% capacitance retention over 10000 cycles.288 Printed graphene aerogels have attracted much interest for significantly improving specific capacitance.289 Ma et al. designed hydrothermal growth of 2D MnO2 nanosheets on 3D printed microporous graphene aerogels (GAs) for SCs. The MnO2/GA samples showed the structure of the composite, in which 2D MnO2 nanoflakes were uniformly grown on both sides of the GA network. The specific discharge capacities of the MnO2/GA samples under different reaction times (3 h, 6 h, 9 h and 12 h) at a specific discharge current of 2 A g−1 are provided in Fig. 19b. When the reaction time was 6 h, the best specific capacitance could reach 213 F g−1. Besides, the composite electrodes exhibited superior specific capacitance (275 F g−1) and excellent cycling stability after 5000 cycles.290 Li et al. successfully prepared a novel 2D free standing and flexible MnO2/graphene film (MGF) for SCs via spin-coating and hydrothermal methods. The graphene film was used as a substrate for the in situ growth of MnO2 nanosheets, and MnO2 nanosheets only vertically arranged on one side of graphene films. The MGF exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, such as a high specific capacitance of up to 280 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and outstanding cycle stability (the capacity retention rate was 91% at 1 A g−1 after 10000 cycles).291 In addition, Peng's group has also attracted extensive attention to synthesize ultrathin MnO2/graphene hybrid nanostructures for flexible planar SCs, which are formed by stacking chemically bonded quasi-2D δ-MnO2 nanosheets with a graphene sheet hybrid structure. The MnO2 integrated on graphene can rationally adjust the distance between two sheets of densely stacked graphene and extend the interlayer space to allow for more electrolyte ions to penetrate efficiently into the hybridized film. Furthermore, the devices showed high specific capacitances of 267 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and 208 F g−1 at 10 A g−1, and cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 92% after 7000 charge/discharge cycles.292 Wang et al. created PANI-assisted MnO2 ultrathin nanosheets uniformly grown on graphene sheets, which achieved a high energy density of 7.9 W h kg−1 at an ultrahigh power density of 11804 W kg−1 and an excellent electrochemical stability with 91.5% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles for ASCs. The formation process of the G@MnO2 nanosheet composite is depicted in Fig. 19c.293 Flexible graphene foam (GF) was considered as an ideal substrate that can provide a large space for ion/electron transfer and load high-capacity active materials.294 Heterogeneous NiCo2O4–MnO2 arrays grown on GF were fabricated by a facile two-step hydrothermal process. The electrode exhibited a remarkable gravimetric specific capacitance of 2577 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. In addition, an ASC was assembled with NiCo2O4–MnO2/GF as the positive electrode and a CNT/GF composite as the negative electrode, delivering a maximum specific energy of 55.1 W h kg−1 at a specific power of 187.5 W kg−1.295

The potential window is an important factor affecting the performance of SCs, and a too narrow potential window will curb the increase of energy density.296 Jia and co-workers expanded the potential window by combining graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with MnO2 to form GQDs/MnO2 heterostructures. The MnO2 nanosheets were vertically arranged and interconnected to form a network structure, and the deposition of GQDs on the surface of the MnO2 nanosheets did not change the morphology of the nanosheets. Compared with MnO2, GQDs/MnO2 showed ideal pseudo-capacitance characteristics and excellent cycling stability. The specific capacitance of GQD/MnO2 can reach 1094 F g−1 when the scan rate was 5 mV s−1, while the capacitance of pure MnO2 nanosheets was only 393 F g−1 (Fig. 19d), and the capacitance retention rate of GQD/MnO2 was 95.4% after 10000 cycles.297 Zhou et al. created a layered electrode made by growing vertical graphene nanosheets (VGNs) and then depositing a thin layer of MnO2. Interestingly, MnO2/VGN exhibited very high areal capacitances as high as 56 mF cm−2.298
Graphene oxide (GO) is one of the most important derivatives of graphene, and GO is one of the most important derivatives of graphene, which is characterized by a layered structure with oxygen-containing functional groups at the basal planes and edges.299 Zhao et al. proposed a simple method to synthesize layered MnO2 nanosheets with a high surface area (157 m2 g−1) using graphene oxide as a template for the first time. The layered MnO2 nanosheets completely took the place of the graphene oxide framework and retained the intriguing 2D structure of graphene by a facile redox method. The specific capacitance of MnO2 nanosheets demonstrated a prominent capacitance of 1183 F g−1 at 5 A g−1.300 An all-solid-state fiber SC with enhanced electrochemical performance was obtained with two intertwined δ-MnO2/holey reduced graphene oxide (HRGO) fiber electrodes solidified in a H3PO4–polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel electrolyte. The schematic process of δ-MnO2 (4.0)/HRGO fiber is presented in Fig. 19f (in 4.0 mM KMnO4 solution). The δ-MnO2 (4.0)/HRGO fiber electrode showed a larger specific capacitance (245 F g−1) at 1 A g−1. After 1000 cycles, the specific capacitance of δ-MnO2 (4.0)/HRGO electrodes was 198 F g−1, corresponding to 81% of its initial capacitance.301 Afterwards, the formation of a HRGO/MnO2 composite employing glucose modified GO through a facile hydrothermal method was reported by Wang's group. HRGO/MnO2 maintained 90.12% of the original capacitance (270 F g−1) after 50000 charge–discharge cycles at 10 A g−1. After assembling as ASC, it delivered a high energy density of 30.1 W h kg−1 with a power density of 945 W kg−1.302
Besides, incorporating graphene-based materials into 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials also has been studied for MIBs. Hierarchically ultrathin MnO2 nanoplatelets decorated on the surface of graphene-based TiO2 (B) hybrids for LIBs were reported. The reversible capacity of the composites remains at 243 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles, with a capacity retention of 83.5%.303 Zhou et al. fabricated a 2D hierarchical Mn2O3@graphene composite via a one-step solid-phase reaction. Interestingly, Mn2O3@graphene-20 (an amount of graphene of 20 mg) exhibited an outstanding initial specific capacity of 2125.9 mA h g−1, which faded to 1746.8 mA h g−1 after the 100th charge and discharge cycle at 0.1 A g−1, which was about 82.2% of the initial capacity. The cycling performances of Mn2O3@graphene-20 at 0.5 A g−1 suggested that a reversible capacity of 1544.4 mA h g−1 can be retained steadily after about 360 cycles.99 A hierarchical Mn2O3@graphene composite was reported as a high rate and ultrastable cathode for aqueous ZIBs. The preliminary cycle performance of Mn2O3@graphene-x (x represents different amounts of graphene additives in the starting materials of 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg, respectively) at 0.3 A g−1 within the voltage range of 0.8–1.9 V is shown in Fig. 19e. The Mn2O3@graphene-40 sample showed an excellent specific capacity of 850.3 mA h g−1 at 0.3 A g−1. Moreover, a high reversible capacity of 125 mA h g−1 after 5000 cycles can be obtained at a high current density of 7 A g−1.304 Tang et al. prepared ultrathin nanosheet-assembled hierarchical Mn3O4/graphene microflowers, and the synthesized composites showed a high lithium storage capacity (∼900 mA h g−1) and superior cycle stability (∼400 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles).305 An all-nanosheet-based full LIB was fabricated with ZnMn2O4–graphene hybrid nanosheets as the anode and showed an excellent rate capability and cycling stability.306 The electrochemical properties of MnxCo3−xO4 nanosheets for LIBs have attracted extensive attention. However, they always suffer from capacity decay. A recently study suggested that the incorporation of rGO can obviously slow down the capacity decay of MnxCo3−xO4 nanosheets, such as Mn1.08Co1.92O4 nanosheets reaching about 229 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 for 50 cycles, and Mn1.08Co1.92O4/rGO nanosheets showed excellent stability at 0.1 A g−1, achieving about 1118 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. Even at 1 A g−1, they suffered from some capacity decline over the first 25 cycles, and then the capacity increased to ∼435 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles.307 Some graphene-based and 2D nanostructured Mn-based composite materials for EES are shown in Table 7.

MXenes are a recently discovered family of transition metal carbides and/or nitrides chemically separated from the layered Mn+1AXn precursor, where M represents an early transition metal element (such as Ti, Zr, V, and Nb), a stands for an element of A-group III or IV, and X is carbon and/or nitrogen.308 What's more, MXenes are known as the novel star of 2D materials beyond graphene because of their fascinating features of high metallic conductivity (8000 S cm−1) together with remarkable chemical stability and rich surface functionality, so they are also one of the promising electrode materials in the field of SCs and MIBs.309,310 Mn-based oxides offer large-capacity charge storage, as well as high theoretical pseudocapacitance, but are limited by poor electrical conductivity. Incorporating MXene materials into Mn-based oxides can effectively prepare composites with good structural stability and high electrical conductivity. A MnO2/MXene composite can overcome the defects of low conductivity of MnO2 and low capacity of MXenes. Meanwhile, the 2D layered structure will expose more active surface area of MnO2, which shows a promising electrochemical performance as an electrode material.311 Ti3C2Tx is the most extensively studied MXene and has already been discovered among more than 30 kinds.312 Bo et al. designed a 3D Ti3C2Tx aerogel as a multifunctional scaffold to support MnO2 nanosheets for the first time. Fig. 20a illustrates the preparation of MnO2/Ti3C2Txvia van der Waals assisted freeze drying, followed by cyclic voltammetry electrodeposition. Termination by functional groups enables even dispersion of atomic sites for the capture and in situ growth of covalently bonded MnO2. To further demonstrate the merits of MnO2/Ti3C2Tx, the gravimetric capacitance curves at various scan rates of Ti3C2Tx, MnO2/rGO and MnO2/Ti3C2Tx are shown in Fig. 20b. Among all the electrodes, MnO2/Ti3C2Tx exhibited an impressive gravimetric pseudocapacitance and rate capability. The gravimetric pseudocapacitance of MnO2/Ti3C2Tx was 341 F g−1, apparently higher than those of MnO2/rGO (90 F g−1) and Ti3C2Tx (47 F g−1) at a high scan rate of 100 mV s−1.313 Chen and coworkers used positive MnO2 nanosheets assembled on negative Ti3C2Tx nanosheets to form a MnO2/Ti3C2Tx composite with electrostatic interaction by a self-assembly process. Furthermore, the MnO2/Ti3C2Tx composites can promote the conductivity and prevent the self-stacking of nanosheets, resulting in an excellent electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 340 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which was higher than three times that of Ti3C2Tx (109 F g−1) and MnO2 nanosheets (137 F g−1). Finally, the MnO2/Ti3C2Tx electrode showed a high retention rate (90.3% retention at 10 A g−1) and good cycle life (87.6% of the initial specific capacitance was retained after 2000 cycles at 4 A g−1).314 Qi et al. employed Ti3C2Tx as a highly conductive material added into MnO2 nanosheets and used CC as a flexible conductive substrate to support them for ZIBs. The highly conductive Ti3C2Tx layer not only acts as a stable conductive carrier to provide an effective electron transport path for MnO2, but also provides additional Zn2+ storage sites to increase the charge storage capacity. According to different dipping times, the samples were named CC@MnO2@MXene-5, CC@MnO2@MXene-10 and CC@MnO2@MXene-15. Their rate performances are compared in Fig. 20c; the CC@MnO2@MXene-10 electrode delivered the best discharge specific capacity of 517.0 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 55.8 mA h g−1 at 5.0 A g−1.315 Liu et al. fabricated a flexible and stable Ti3C2/MnO2 film by molecularly stacking sheets in a glue-like TMA ion medium by vacuum-assisted filtration. Ti3C2/MnO2 compared with MnO2 and Ti3C2 electrodes demonstrated a much-improved capacitive behavior for the hybrid electrode, such as 390 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, higher than that of MnO2 (133 F g−1) and Ti3C2 (50 F g−1). A novel Ti3C2/MnO2 hybrid film worked as a flexible SC electrode, which delivered a high capacitance of 390 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1 and a maximum energy density and power density of 8.3 W h kg−1 (at 221.33 W kg−1) and 2376 W kg−1 (at 3.3 W h kg−1).33 Zhu's group prepared a manganese-vanadium hybrid of K-V2C@MnO2 through MnO2 nanosheets uniformly growth on a V2CTx surface, and designed a metal-cation intercalation in situ growth strategy. As shown in Fig. 20d, the interlayer distance of V2CTx can be effectively increased after cation intercalation, which created positive conditions for MnO2 to grow on the surface of alkalized V2CTx. The cycling performances of K-V2C@MnO2, K-V2C@MnO2 without MnSO4, and δ-MnO2 electrodes at 0.3 A g−1 are presented in Fig. 20e; K-V2C@MnO2 electrodes delivered superior cycle performance that reversible capacity gradually increased to 392.8 mA h g−1 in the 100th cycle. Moreover, it is very interesting that K-V2C@MnO2 without MnSO4 undergoes spontaneous dissolution into the electrolyte and activation of MnO2 during the initial cycle, which can suppress MnO2 structural damage. Therefore, due to the stable hybrid structure, K-V2C@MnO2 can maintain a stable capacity even without the MnSO4 additive.316

7.1.3. LDH-based composites. 
LDHs have been widely studied in recent years because of their flexible ion-exchange ability and adjustable composition.317 So far, a large number of research studies related to LDHs have been reported, each time underlying the fact that they possess phenomenal electrochemical activities, such as the Ni–Co LDH electrode showed a high specific capacitance of 2682 F g−1 at 3 A g−1.32 The porous Co–Al hydroxide nanosheet electrode exhibited remarkably high specific capacitance (1043 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and ultra-high rate performance capability (912 F g−1 at 20 A g−1).318 However, the capacity retention rate of LDHs is not satisfactory under high current density (more than 20 A g−1). It is interesting work to study the combination of MnO2 and LDHs as an electrode material. Li's group once designed a NiFe/MnO2 layered nanocomposite through a layer-by-layer self-assembly method and flocculated technology based on electrostatic interaction of positively charged NiFe LDH nanosheets and negatively charged MnO2 nanosheets. Electrochemical results revealed that the material had high electrochemical capacitance.319 Quan et al. performed restacking of Ni–Mn LDH and MnO2 nanosheets via exfoliation treatments. Pure MnO2, pure Ni–Mn LDH, a mixture of the two components via simple manual mixing and a MnO2/Ni–Mn LDH composite were also prepared for comparison. The experimental results showed that the new composite from Ni–Mn LDH and MnO2 nanosheets had an improved specific surface area and longer cycle life than the other substances in a Na2SO4 (0.5 M) electrolyte.320 Zhao and colleagues prepared CoMn-LDH@MnO2 composites grown on Ni foam, which were obtained from Co–Mn LDH nanoneedles with two-step hydrothermal for the first time. CoMn-LDH@MnO2 possessed capacitances of 2325.1, 2220.3, 1800.8, 1650.4, 1601.1, and 1508.2 F g−1 at 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 8, and 10 A g−1, respectively. The hybrid electrode exhibited outstanding cycling stability retaining 97.14% of its initial capacitance. The as-assembled SC presented an energy density of 59.73 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1000.09 W kg−1, and it retained 95% of its initial capacitance after 10000 cycles at 30 mA cm−2.321 Multicomponent Co–Al-LDH–rGO-layered MnO2 (CAGM) nanohybrids were designed through the incorporation of Co–Al LDH into the porous hybrid networks of rGO and layered MnO2 nanosheets. The improvement with hybrid networks of ion-transport and the increase of porosity are the main reasons for the enhancement of electrode performance.322
Introducing high electrical conductivity materials into 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials can obviously enhance the conductivity of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials and further increase the capacity. Although the mentioned 2D nanostructured Mn-based composite materials show the favorable desirable performance of improving conductivity, the other electrochemical performances of materials with high electrochemical activity and cycling stability should be explored to get further optimization.

7.2. Defect engineering
The attractive structural and compositional features of defective 2D materials endow them with abundant advantageous characteristics (high electrical conductivity, more electrochemically active site, expanded layer distance, etc.), and the merits make them promising materials in various energy storage devices.323 Defect engineering has also gradually gain attention for 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials in EES devices due to the potential unique electronic properties, accelerating the kinetics of surface redox reactions and enhancing conductivity.324 Vacancies are usually caused by defects or dislocations of oxygen or cations on the planar structure of 2D nanosheets, which lead to bond deformation between two adjacent atoms. What's more, defects can also be created by replacing lattice atoms with heteroatoms with different sizes and electronegativities, distorting the structure by disturbing the electron distribution due to non-uniform bond lengths and density of states.223 In general, we can classify all the defect engineering strategies into four broad categories, ionic vacancies, atomic/molecular doping, amorphous phases, and phase interfaces.325,326 The defect engineering of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials will be discussed from several aspects with ion vacancies, substitution doping, and interlayer and tunnel doping.

7.2.1. Ionic vacancies. 
The ionic vacancies mainly refer to anion and cation vacancies. The anion vacancies could tune the barrier of ion diffusion, which can increase the diffusion path and promote the ion diffusion kinetics.325,327 Introducing oxygen vacancies (VO) is an essential defect engineering strategy to modify the surface chemistry and geometry of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the presence of oxygen vacancies leads to an increase in the density of states, which improves the redox reaction of Mn-based materials.324 A schematic diagram of the synthesis of δ-MnO2 with oxygen vacancies through a simple oxidation or reduction process is shown in Fig. 21a. Taking H2O2 as an example, it provides an oxygen-rich environment and interstitial oxygen spontaneously binds strongly to lattice oxygen, resulting in the substitution of the neutral O2 dimer at one O position. This particular structure is relatively unstable and may spontaneously splits into isolated vacancies, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies. After oxidation treatment, the content of lattice oxygen in MnO2 decreases, which is beneficial to improve the electrical conductivity. More importantly, the surface-adsorbed oxygen content increases, which will increase the surface reactivity or electrochemically active sites of MnO2.328 An ultrathin nanosheet structure of MnO2 with abundant VO has been reported by Liu's group. The specific capacitance of MnO2 is fundamentally enhanced by VO and surface modification of carbon cloth (SMCC) at different current densities as depicted in Fig. 21b. The electrochemical results indicated that the specific capacitances of MnO2/SMCC and MnO2/CC are 508 F g−1 and 308 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively.329 Cui et al. noted that surface defects are easily consumed and disappeared in cyclic electrochemical reactions, which will lead to significant capacitance decline. Subsequently, they performed multifunctional VO engineering combining mild H-plasma and O-plasma with birnessite-MnO2. The structural evolution of birnessite-MnO2 with a robust lattice VO (LOV-MnO2) is described briefly in Fig. 21c, Firstly, due to the reducibility of hydrogen plasma, MnO2−x with a mixed-valence composition of Mn3+ and Mn4+ with oxygen vacancies in both the surface region and lattice regimes was formed, and then the O-plasma process was used to repair the surface oxygen vacancies consumed during annealing, and finally maintained its lattice oxygen vacancies. Eventually, the electrochemical results showed that the specific capacitance of LOV-MnO2 electrodes at 1 A g−1 was 445.1 F g−1 while that of pristine MnO2 was 258.7 F g−1.330 Interesting MnO2 nanostructures with rich VO were fabricated through a hydrothermal method followed by heat treatment under hydrogen gas for the introduction of Mn3+/Mn2+, and were named H-MnOx nanosheets. The hydrogenation process can change the crystalline phase and construct VO at the material interface without damage to the interconnected nanostructure. In electrochemical tests, H-MnOx nanosheets delivered a high specific capacitance of 640 mF cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 and cycling stability with 84.6% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles.331 Yan and colleagues investigated electrochemically activated MnO2 to generate VO under positive voltage, whereas the electrolyte cations are embedded in the interlayer under negative voltage. The synthesis process involved hydrothermal treatment and application of external positive/negative electric fields. These two electrochemical activation methods had a positive impact on the pseudocapacitance of MnO2, and well-maintained the 3D network structure composed of nanosheets on the collector. Furthermore, the electrochemically activated MnO2 recorded phenomenal cycle stabilities, which retained 91.3%, 100.9%, and 83.3% of initial capacity after 5000 charge–discharge cycles for 0.8V-MnO2, −0.8V-MnO2 and pure-MnO2 electrodes, respectively.332 Liu et al. designed MnO2/Mn2O3 nanospheres with nanosheet assembly via a novel mechanism of multi-Mn ion and self-triggered VO redox reactions. The MnO2/Mn2O3 electrode mainly exhibited a capacitance-like surface redox reaction between Mn3+ and Mn4+ in the range of 0–1.2 V, while the cut-off working potential becomes −0.3 V, causing a tunable multiple oxidation of Mn2+, Mn3+ and Mn4+. The reduction reaction was accompanied by the spontaneous generation of abundant VO. The illustration of the charge storage mechanism of MnO2/Mn2O3 with active phase transition and in situ self-generation of VO is shown in Fig. 21d. The excellent performance of energy storage of the MnO2/Mn2O3 electrode can be attributed to rich VO in the active structure inducing new electronic states and electron redistribution between Mn and O, which increase the total charge storage via promoting multi-Mn ion redox reactions. The electron density of MnO2 with VO is shown in Fig. 21e.333 Jiang et al. demonstrated the charge storage mechanism for the high-stability MnOx@graphene microsphere electrode in a KOH electrolyte via in situ Raman and DFT calculations. K+ ions inserted into layered MnO2 during the discharge process. In the octahedral structure of [MnO6], the length of Mn–O bonds close to K+ ions becomes longer, and the long unstable Mn–O bonds tend to lose oxygen and generate VO, which further transformed the layered structure into a stable spinel structure. The assembled MnOx@rGO//AC SC showed 156 A g−1 and retained 83% of it after 2000 cycles.37

The existence of Mn vacancies will result in the distortion of neighboring atoms, leading to electronic delocalization, and thus enhancing the conductivity, pseudocapacitance and rate capability of MnO2.334 δ-MnO2 with Mn vacancy associated alkali ions (K, Na, and Li) was prepared via a simple hydrothermal method. The position of the alkali ion in the MnO2 structure can be controlled by adjusting the ion concentration. The data demonstrated that the alkali-ion was embedded in Mn vacancies at low concentration, while entering the interlayer of MnO2 at high concentration. Finally, compared to pure MnO2, the specific capacitances of optimized 0.4 KMO (K/Mn = 0.4), 0.4NaMO and 0.4LiMO samples are enhanced about 1.9, 1.6 and 1.6 times, respectively.335 In early research, single-layer MnO2 nanosheets with Mn vacancies can be synthesized by adjusting the temperature of precursors generated by the reaction. For example, when KMnO4 is used to synthesize a precursor (KxMnO2) with Mn vacancies, the lower the temperature, the more Mn vacancies there are.336 Afterwards, Wang et al. designed a single-layer MnO2 nanosheet with defect engineering based on the above method. Interestingly, the concentration of Mn vacancies for the as-prepared nanosheets can be easily tuned by controlling the temperature at which KxMnO2 was prepared in the first step; the lower the temperature, the more vacancies exist. Furthermore, they found that in a single-layered MnO2 nanosheet these pores were not only Mn vacancies, but also O vacancies.337 Guo et al. prepared δ-MnO2 nanosheets by exfoliation of crystalline KxMnO2 and adjusting different pH to introduce Mn vacancies into the nanosheets by controlling the extent of Mn4+–Mn3+ reduction. Mn vacancies within the sheet and a six-fold coordinated Mn3+ site on the surface of the nanosheet are named “surface Frenkel defects”. The final results demonstrated an increase of the Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio with decreasing pH and the electrochemical results showed direct correlation of Mn cation defects with specific capacitance. The specific capacitance increased from about 200 F g−1 (pH = 4) to over 300 F g−1 (pH = 2) by intentional introduction of 30% surface Frenkel defects.338


7.2.2. Substitution doping. 
Doping elements into Mn-based materials to form mixed oxides is an effective strategy to boost the structural stability and specific capacity.339 Metal doping possesses many advantages, such as it can generate a new energy level, adjust the binding energy of electrons for Mn-based materials to gain a better capacitive performance, and the intrinsic conductivity of Mn-based materials can be enhanced without interface restriction via modulating the crystal structure or physical interaction.340 At present, the doped metal elements that have been discovered are Ni, Co, Fe, V, Cu, Zn, Mo and Au.341–345 Zong et al. prepared Na-doped MnO2 nanosheet arrays on carbon nanotube fibers (CNTFs) as a positive electrode and flower-like thin MoS2 nanosheet arrays on the CNTFs as the negative electrode, assembling a high-performance fiber-shaped ASC (FASC). The FASC showed an excellent 265.4 mF cm−2 specific capacitance and an ultrahigh energy density of 178.4 μW h cm−2. In addition, FASCs had excellent flexibility with a capacitance retention of 92.4% after bending 3500 times.346 Due to the similar properties of transition metals, transition metals with the same period as Mn have been widely used as doping atoms to change the electronic structure of Mn-based materials.347 Liu and co-workers explored the influence of V-doped layered birnessite on pseudo-capacitance performance. The results suggested that an appropriate amount of V doping will improve the specific capacitance and cycle stability, which is mainly due to the reduction of the particle size and diffusion resistance due to the addition of vanadium.348 Hu et al. presented a facile hydrothermal method to synthesize 2D α-MnO2 nanosheets with V doping. The schematic diagram of the synthesis process of V doped MnO2 and the crystal structure of α-MnO2 with (1 × 1) or (2 × 2) tunnels are shown in Fig. 22a. During the formation of 2D MnO2, V was simultaneously doped into the (2 × 2) tunnel, which effectively enlarged the specific surface area and enhanced the electronic conductivity. Therefore, V-doped α-MnO2 nanosheets exhibit high specific capacitance (439 F g−1).53 Liu et al. proposed Fe doped MnO2 nanosheets reconfigured by galvanostatic charge/discharge activation. The activated Fe–MnO2 was reconstituted from nanosheets into a composite structure of Fe-doped and oxygen-deficient nanosheets and nanowires. DFT calculations indicated that the co-existence of Fe doping and oxygen defects induced more delocalized charges, and the nanowires on the nanosheets exhibited tip-enhanced electric field effects to attract more ions, which effectively improved electron and ion transfer kinetics. Benefiting from the advantages, the reconstructed Fe–MnO2 showed a specific capacitance of 500.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is significantly higher than that of Fe–MnO2 with 379.2 F g−1. Furthermore, an ASC device based on the reconstructed Fe–MnO2 cathode demonstrated an outstanding cycling stability, which could maintain 91.2% of the initial capacitance over 12000 cycles at 10 A g−1.349 Chen et al. designed a chemical bath deposition approach to optimize the electronic structure of ultrathin δ-MnO2 nanosheets by Ni-doping. The ultrathin δ-MnO2 nanosheet electrode exhibited desirable rate capacity and superior cycling stability when the nickel doping content was 1.0 mol%. The Ni-doped δ-MnO2 displayed the best specific capacitance of 337.9 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and the specific capacitance can be maintained at 158 F g−1 even as the current density increases to 20 A g−1. The corresponding capacitance retention was as high as 98.6% after 4000 cycles.350 Nanostructures with Ni-doped MnO2 nanoflakes on a CNT template as a cathode were synthesized for ultra-long life magnesium/lithium hybrid ion batteries. The initial discharge specific capacities of 126, 146, and 400 mA h g−1 were measured at a current density of 20 mA g−1 for pure MnO2 nanostructures on CNT (CMO), Ni-doped MnO2 on CNTs using nickel chloride as the dopant source (CMONC) and Ni-doped MnO2 on CNTs using metallic nickel as the dopant source (CMOMN), respectively. The CMOMN electrodes demonstrated a maximum specific capacity of 175 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1, and also exhibited outstanding electrochemical performance by retaining a high capacity of over 87% for 3000 cycles.351 Wang et al. created flexible micro-SCs by doping of 3d metal ions (Co, Fe, and Ni) into 2D MnO2 nanosheets. The effect of doping on the electronic properties of MnO2 nanosheets was calculated by first principles. The partial density of states (PDOS) of pristine δ-MnO2 (Fig. 22b) and 5% metal ion (Co, Fe, and Ni) doping is shown in Fig. 22c–e, and it can be seen that 5% Fe doping has a greater contribution to the carrier density. Fe-doped MnO2 nanosheets as active materials revealed a high volumetric energy density of up to 1.13 × 10−3 W h cm−3 at a power density of 0.11 W cm−3.38 The above comparison can be explained as follows: in the O6 octahedral crystal field, the electrons in Fe4+ (d4s0) will be in a high spin state (HS) and occupy a higher eg level near the conduction band. Therefore, it contributes a lot to the carrier density. However, in Co4+ (d5s0) and Ni4+ (d6s0), electrons are in a low spin state (LS) occupying the t2g state, which is mixed with the valence band, which contributes less to the carrier density.352 Cu-doped δ-MnO2 films with different morphologies grown on Ni foam for SCs were reported. It was revealed that the maximum enhanced performance of Cu-doped MnO2 films can be achieved by possessing an optimized hybrid nanosheet network and flower-like structure. The corresponding specific capacitances of Cu doping concentration at different scan rates suggested that the 2 at% Cu-doped δ-MnO2 film obtained the highest specific capacitance as high as 296 F g−1 at 1 A g−1.342 An optimum Zn doping concentration of 1 mol% doped δ-MnO2 nanoflakes was obtained, which delivered a specific capacitance of ∼466 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and almost two times more than that of the corresponding pristine one.343 Ultrathin nanosheets of silver-doped Mn (Ag2–MnO2) were fabricated via a hydrothermal method. The Ag2–MnO2 electrode delivered the highest specific capacitance of 350 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Furthermore, an ASC (Ag2–MnO2//AC) constructed with Ag2–MnO2 as the positive electrode showed a remarkable energy density of 54 W h kg−1 at a power density of 2000 W kg−1 as well as excellent cycling stability and capacitance retention of 80% after 10000 GCD cycles.353

7.2.3. Interlayer and tunnel doping. 
According to the previous point of view, increases in tunnel dimensions can result a higher achievable specific capacity, and intercalation can greatly reduce these capacity fading issues induced by structural instability due to the reduced volumetric variation during the insertion/extraction process of carrier ions.354 δ-MnO2 with a layered structure and α-MnO2 with a tunnel structure are reported widely, and they have been recognized as suitable compounds for an electrode material for intercalation/deintercalation-based charge storage due to the larger interlayer spacing and tunnel.355 Alkali metal ion (K+, Na+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, and Al3+) intercalation hasbecome an effective strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of MnO2.249,356 Ma et al. investigated the unusual intercalation phenomena of alkali cations (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) in a sulfate-based electrolyte in the electrochemical behavior of δ-MnO2 nanosheets. The charge storage mechanism of δ-MnO2via electrochemical intercalation/deintercalation of alkali cations is illustrated in Fig. 22f.357 Compared with monovalent cations, multivalent metal ion intercalation may induce excellent theoretical capacitance. Divalent metal ion (Mg2+, Fe2+ and Ni2+) intercalated δ-MnO2 nanosheets were synthesized via hydrothermal processes. Mg-intercalated δ-MnO2 nanosheets showed the highest capacitance of about 301.8 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 in an aqueous MgSO4 electrolyte among all the MnO2-based assemblies. As we can see in Fig. 22g, it can be inferred that the structure of the Mg-containing δ-MnO2 assembly was different from that of Ni- or Fe-involved assemblies. Mg-intercalated δ-MnO2 nanosheets suggested that some of the Mg2+ ions existed in the interlayer by replacing K+ while the rest were located in the MnO2 octahedron, but Ni2+ and Fe2+ ions were present in the assembly by replacing K+ ions in the layer.358 An ASC was assembled with Bi3+-modified MnO2 as the cathode electrode and N-doped carbon as the anode electrode. Due to the strong hybridization between Bi and O in MnO2, Bi3+ can stabilize the layer structure. The as-assembled ASC delivered a high energy density of up to 63 W h kg−1 and a power density of up to 39 kW kg−1 and 83% capacitance retention after 40000 cycles.359 He et al. proposed an effective modification approach to improve the crystal structure stability of 2D K+ intercalated δ-MnO2 (2D KMnO) by metal ion doping. As shown in Fig. 22h, the crystal structure of KMnO was transformed by metal ion doping. As the reaction time increased from 10 minutes to 30 minutes, Ba2+ and Sn2+-doped 2D KMnO transformed into α-MnO2 with a tunneled structure due to the different bond lengths of Mn3+–O and Mn4+–O, while Co3+ and Ni2+-doped 2D KMnO maintained the layered structure of 2D KMnO, indicating that Co and Ni doping can restrain the morphology conversion of KMnO from the 2D nanosheet to the 1D nanowire. Moreover, 2D Co3+-doped KMnO exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 342.7 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and an excellent cycling stability with 95.3% capacitance retention after 20000 cycles at 5 A g−1.360 TMA+-intercalated birnessite was obtained by replacing K+-intercalated MnO2 with TMA+ ions through an ion-exchange process, which induced larger interlayer spacing and weaker interlayer interactions. The schematic illustration of the ion-exchange process illustrated that K-birnessite was transformed into H-birnessite by reacting with (NH4)2S2O8, and then turned into TMA-birnessite by further reacting with TMAOH solutions (Fig. 22i). Due to the larger diameter of TMA+ than K+, the interlayer spacing of TMA-birnessite (∼0.77 nm) had enlarged by 0.25 nm compared to K-birnessite (∼0.52 nm). The TMA+ intercalated birnessite-MnO2 exhibited an impressive electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 580.05 F g−1 at a current density of 2.0 A g−1 and excellent rate capability and cycling performance with a capacitance retention of 112% after 10000 charge/discharge cycles.361 Apart from ions and metal oxides, there are a lot of small molecules, such as crystal water and glucose that also achieve better performance of layered MnO2. Mao et al. designed an Ag2O-intercalated hollow MnO2 (Ag2O–HMnO2) electrode with both ion and electron transport channels, aiming at simultaneously achieving high mass-loading and superior ions/electron transferability. When used in SCs it achieved an ultrahigh volumetric energy density of about 7.33 mW h cm−3, approximately six times compared to that of pristine MnO2 (1.24 mW h cm−3).362 Nonmetal doped 2D MnO2 for ZIBs has been widely reported. For example, Zhang et al. prepared N-doped ε-MnO2 and suggested that N-doping promoted the intercalation of H+ and the corresponding capacity contribution. Besides, the MnO2@N cathode exhibited better cycle stability than pure MnO2. The capacity retention rate of the MnO2@N cathode was 83% after 1000 cycles, which was higher than the 27% capacity retention rate for the original MnO2 cathode.363 The different element doped 2D MnO2 applications for SCs and ZIBs are shown in Table 8.

To date, defect engineering has been proven to be a powerful technique to increase the electrochemical capacity of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials. Briefly, ionic defect engineering can enhance the electrochemical surface area and fast ion transport. Heteroatom substitution doping can increase the conductivity and cycling performance. Interlayer and tunnel doped with ions or compounds can boost structural stability and reduce capacity fading. However, the current research on anion-doped 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials is limited the modification by defect engineering is mainly on 2D MnO2. The potential of the strategy can still be glimpsed for EES.

8. Advanced characterization technologies of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials for EES
Recent efforts have increasingly focused on various advanced characterization technologies that provide significant insights into the electrochemical mechanism. Ex situ analyses have shown significant limitations in comprehensive understanding about structural changes for electrochemical storage materials, and the indispensable in situ characterization techniques have an edge over ex situ techniques considering their real-time data acquisition during the dynamic changes occurring in electrodes.364 Therefore, an increasing number of research studies are focused on understanding the chemical dynamics taking place during any reaction by in situ and operando techniques, which is beneficial to enrich the electrochemical properties of materials.365 In this section, the information obtained from advanced characterization technologies on Mn-based materials and their composites is discussed. Among all X-ray-based operando techniques, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have attracted growing attention because of their indispensable qualitative data analysis and data acquisition. When X-rays are bombarded by matter, it will cause scattering, emission, transmission or absorption. Due to the nondestructive wave properties of X-rays, they can reveal the electrochemical mechanism in real time conveniently and effectively.366
8.1. 
          In situ XRD

In situ XRD works in the same way as ex situ XRD, and both are based on the scattering of X-rays by periodically spaced atoms in the crystal, producing diffraction patterns, yielding information about the crystal structure to qualitatively analyze crystal phases, lattice parameters and crystal defects. The difference is that the in situ technique performs uninterrupted inspection of the electrode material under testing.367 Recently, in order to understand and investigate the charge storage mechanism of K0.27MnO2·0.54H2O (KMO) with an ultrathin nanosheet morphology in aqueous ZIBs, a series of advanced techniques including in operando XRD and an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) have been used. In situ XRD characterization (2θ range of 5° to 60°) shown in Fig. 23a evaluated the structure and phase transformation of KMO during charge/discharge cycles. For all scans, the diffraction peaks are located at constant diffraction angles of 26.5°, 40.2° and 46.5°, which correspond to the SpectroMembrane film and Pt foil respectively, and the appearance/disappearance of a series of new peaks located at 8.2°, 16.4°, and 24.2° is observed during the discharge/charge process. These peaks can be assigned to ZHS. It is consistent with previously reported experiments of Mn-based materials for rechargeable ZIBs.368 The evolution of these peak intensities confirms that ZHS gradually precipitates during discharge (maximum intensity of Zn2+/Zn at 0.7 V) and dissolves in a reversible manner during charging (no residual diffraction peaks above 1.6 V). The reversibility of this precipitation/dissolution process was confirmed as the same evolution was observed in the subsequent discharge/charge cycles. Furthermore, a slight shift of the (003) peak at 12.5° can be observed, indicating ion (de)intercalation during charge/discharge cycles. In conclusion, in situ XRD demonstrated the precipitation/dissolution process of ZHS consistent with previous results, and an EQCM has been used to investigate the charge storage mechanism of manganese oxide cathodes during cycling in zinc-containing aqueous electrolytes in the subsequent steps.44Fig. 23b illustrates the sharp oxidation peak of KMO from 0.8 to 1.75 V versus Zn2+/Zn, which is related to the sharp drop of mass during the oxidation scanning. It is consistent with the removal of ions from the structure (black line) and the dissolution of ZHS as emphasized by in situ XRD research. Fig. 23c shows the change of the electrode weight versus the charge passed in the electrode during the reduction process (from 1.75 to 0.8 V vs. Zn2+/Zn). The average molar masses of m/z = 38 g mol−1 and 327 g mol−1 were obtained in the high (about 1.4 V vs., Zn2+/Zn) and low (about 1.2 V vs., Zn2+/Zn) potential regions, respectively. This seem to the intercalation of one H3O+ (Mw = 19 g mol−1), together with H2O molecule, which is consistent with the molar weight 38 g mol−1 observed in the high potential region (around 1.4 V vs. Zn2+/Zn). Importantly, the H3O+ intercalation in the MnO2 electrode would result in a local pH increase that could explain the precipitation of ZHS, leading to both a mass increase.369 Zeng et al. prepared ultrathin amorphous MnO2 nanosheets over Fe2O3 spindles at 95 °C under mild conditions via a carbon-coating method for enhanced lithium storage.370 The samples that reacted at 95 °C and 140 °C were named Fe2O3@MnO2-95 and Fe2O3@MnO2-140, respectively. In situ XRD results show that in the Fe2O3@MnO2-95 electrode, Fe–Mn–O shells are formed on Fe2O3. The Fe–Mn–O shell effectively maintains the integrity of the electrode during cycling, thereby improving the cycling stability. In the Fe2O3@MnO2-140 electrode, the Fe–O and Mn–O phases undergo spatial separation, leading to the decomposition of the electrode during cycling. Furthermore, in situ ambient transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) observations of the electrochemically driven lithiation/delithiation of Fe2O3@MnO2-95 nanocomposites show that the in situ generated Fe–Mn–O shells have better electrical conductivity, uncompromising Li+ penetration and enhanced structural integration for enhanced Li storage.368,371

8.2. 
          In situ XAS
XAS is a synchrotron-based technique that measures the X-ray absorption coefficient μ as a function of photon energy E near and above the absorption edge threshold of a selected element. XAS spectra are collected by tuning the photon energy to a specific range that excites the core electrons using a crystal or plane grating monochromatically.372 The technique can detect all states of matter, including amorphous and crystalline substances in a solid or liquid form. More importantly, it can be used to elucidate the fundamental atomic and electronic structures of energy storage/conversion materials and monitor how these materials change with the charge state under changing working conditions.372,373 However, the mechanisms of ion batteries involve complex phase changes and redox reactions that lead to great complexity, and ex situ XAS measurements can only gain part of valuable information from batteries. Since they may suffer from adverse conditions, which poses great challenges to understand the exact electrochemical reaction mechanisms and kinetics during battery operation.374 In contrast, in situ XAS experiments can provide real-time spectroscopic information of a running custom battery by probing photon intensity changes, which can accurately characterize the electrochemical reactions and kinetics of rechargeable batteries.375 For the investigation of Mn-based materials, in situ XAS technology plays a pivotal role. For instance, to gain some insights into mixed-valence MnOx electrodes achieving anomalously high capacitance, the charge storage mechanism was researched via in situ XAS. The results suggested that a mixed-valence state with a porous nanoarchitecture could promote redox reactions associated with charge storage by both Mn and O sites.376 Using in situ XAS to study the charge storage mechanisms of MnO2 electrodeposited in various aprotic ionic liquids (ILs), it is demonstrated that choosing appropriate constituent ions of ILs can achieve desirable MnO2 pseudocapacitive performance in aprotic electrolytes.94 In order to investigate the change storage mechanism of δ-MnO2 nanosheets, in situ XAS was carried out together with chronoamperometry at different potentials.27 From the in situ high-resolution Mn K-edge fluorescence XAS spectra of δ-MnO2 nanosheet electrodes during charging/discharging processes at 0.0, 0.3, and 0.6 V vs. SCE, it can be clearly observed that δ-MnO2 showed a small pre-edge absorption peak at around 6541 eV compared with other MnO2 standards. This is due to the slightly distorted non-centrosymmetric environment of the MnO6 octahedron, which causes the electrons in the 1s orbital to be excited to the unoccupied 3d orbital.377 The results can be explained by the migration of solvated ions. At high positive or positive potentials of 0.0–0.6 V (vs. SCE), solvated anions migrate to the electrode surface while cations are repelled. On the other hand, from 0.6 to 0.0 V vs. SCE at the reverse potential, the oxidation state of Mn decreases due to the repulsion of solvated ions to the working electrode.376 Plentiful reports have proved that the addition of carbon materials can significantly improve the performance of SCs and it is necessary to explore the atomic/electronic structural changes of the composite during the charge–discharge process.378 Chang et al. prepared MnO2 nanoflakes/functionalized CNTs through a spontaneous redox reaction. Fig. 23d compares the in situ Mn K-edge XAS spectra of MnO2/acid-functionalized CNTs (C-CNT) and MnO2/amine-functionalized CNTs (N-CNT) during the charge/discharge process under three potentials that were applied in the order 0.0 V, +0.4 V, +0.8 V, +0.4 V (r0.4V), and 0.0 V (r0V). The oxidation (charging process) of the electrode shifted the absorption peak B8 to higher energy from 0 V to 0.8 V, indicating that the average oxidation state of manganese ions in the electrode increased effectively during oxidation. When the electrode potential is restored from 0.8 to 0 V for reduction (discharge), the absorption peak B8 of the electrode is also restored to its initial state. Besides, the pseudocapacitance in SCs is significantly affected by the crystal morphology and tunnel size of MnO2, so MnO2/C-CNT due to its high specific surface area as well as large tunnel in the process of charge/discharge is verified to have higher potential as an electrochemical energy storage device.379 Similarly, K-birnessite MnO2 nanosheets and N-doped reduced graphene oxide aerogels (N-rGO) were prepared. The electrochemical performance of the electrodes was evaluated by in situ electrochemical XAS measurements using chronoamperometry at different potentials (i.e. 0, 0.4, and 0.8 V vs. SCE). The oxidation state of Mn ions in the charged MnO2 electrode rose significantly from +3.01 to +3.12 when a potential of 0.8 V was applied relative to the SCE, and recovered to +3.01 at 0 V relative to the SCE during discharge. This is why MnO2 nanosheets exhibit excellent capacity retention.380 In other research, Nattapol investigated the unusual intercalation phenomena of alkali cations (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) in a sulfate-based electrolyte in the electrochemical behavior of birnessite-type MnO2 nanosheets with Li-intercalated cation (Li–MnO2) by in situ electrochemical synchrotron XAS. Mn K-edge XANES spectra at different applied potentials of Li-birnessite with Li2SO4, Na2SO4, K2SO4, Rb2SO4, and Cs2SO4 electrolytes at 0.5 M were investigated. The results suggested that XAS spectrum of Rb2SO4 remains in its charged state position even if the applied potential returns to −0.1 V vs. the SCE since the solvated Rb+ could not intercalate into the lamellar structure of birnessite. The change in E0 energy between the initial state and the fully charged state of Li2SO4, Na2SO4, K2SO4, Rb2SO4, and Cs2SO4 is 2.2 eV, 2.7 eV, 1.4 eV, 1.3 eV, and 1.0 eV, respectively. Corresponding to the electrochemical results, Li-birnessite in Na2SO4 delivers the highest specific capacitance as a larger number of Mn active sites participate in the redox.357
8.3. 
          In situ Raman

In situ Raman spectroscopy is a simple nondestructive surface-sensitive optical vibrational characterization technique that quantitatively and qualitatively characterizes the interaction of light and matter under operating conditions. In situ Raman spectroscopy can well describe dynamic chemical reactions at the molecular level, irreversible/reversible side reactions, local crystal structural changes, lattice expansion/contraction, and ion intercalation/deintercalation during electrode operation.103 In addition, compared with in situ XRD and ex situ Raman, in situ Raman has advantages in analyzing the local structure of disordered low crystalline amorphous and thin film electrode materials, while the disadvantage is that the fluorescence effect can lead to electrode degradation and a low signal-to-noise ratio.381
Mn-based compounds inevitably involve valence change in electrochemical reactions, so a detailed understanding of the phase changes of Mn-based materials during cycling is vital to reveal the mechanism by which they store energy.382 Cheng et al. prepared non-stoichiometric α-Mn0.98O2-based nanoflake electrode materials for SCs and suggested that α-Mn0.98O2 tends to exist as a more stable mixed-phase of α-MnO2 and Mn3O4 when immersed in aqueous electrolytes via ex situ and in operando Raman spectroscopy.383 In Yang's research, in situ Raman was used to detect the structural changes of the active electrode materials in a pseudocapacitor during potential cycling, to gain more understanding of the structural evolution mechanism of Mn3O4 into δ-MnO2 and its effect. Fig. 24a exhibits the in situ Raman of Mn3O4 collected at different applied potentials during the CV scan at 1 mV s−1. Some obvious changes can be seen in the Raman spectra; as the potential increases to 0.3 V, the band of Mn3O4 disappears, and two new bands appear at about 583 cm−1 and 505 cm−1, indicating the formation of a new structural phase. With the potential increasing to 0.4 V, the intensity of the 659 cm−1 band decreases, and a broad band begins to appear at about 640 cm−1, and then its intensity gradually increases. It means that the phase transition of Mn3O4 to δ-MnO2 has been completed. In another study, the activation process of converting hausmannite-Mn3O4 into amorphous MnO2 (with a localized birnessite structure) by electrochemical cycling in 0.5 M Na2SO4 was examined.384 The charge storage mechanism is proposed as the redox reaction between Mn(III) and Mn(IV) at outer surface active sites, as the disordered birnessite-MnO2 does not provide an ordered layer structure for cations and/or protons to intercalate, which is consisted with in situ Raman spectra.385 For the pseudo-capacitance behavior of δ-MnO2, the widely accepted storage mechanism includes the intercalation/deintercalation of protons (H+) and metal cations (M+) in the electrolyte.383 Yang et al. proposed a Na+ intercalation/deintercalation dominated charge storage mechanism, accompanied by interlayer spacing expansion/contraction for layered δ-MnO2. In operando Raman spectroscopy results proved that no spectral features corresponding to H+ insertion were detected during cycling. Fig. 24b shows in operando Raman spectra acquired at different states of charge/discharge in 1 M Na2SO4 and the corresponding charge/discharge CV curve at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1.386 For another research study, hierarchical MnOx/C nanowires combined with MnOx nanosheets forming a core–shell heterostructure with no characteristic peaks corresponding to MnOOH are found during charging/discharging, indicating that the pseudocapacitive behavior of the MnOx electrode has no relevance to the intercalation/deintercalation of protons (H+) in the electrolyte.387 By adjusting different cations (including Li+, Na+, and K+) in the electrolyte, the influence of the cation size on Raman spectrum evolution can be quantitatively analyzed. The results prove the quantitative relationship between the evolution of spectrum characteristics and the charge stored in the pseudocapacitor MnO2 electrode.388 In the study of Zhang et al., the charge storage mechanism in 2D cation-intercalated manganese oxide Na0.55Mn2O4·1.5H2O (NMO) in neutral and alkaline aqueous electrolytes was investigated. Operando Raman analyses and the corresponding CV curve during charging and discharging in Na2SO4 (c and d) and NaOH (e and f) solutions can be seen in Fig. 24c–f. The results reveal that in neutral Na2SO4 electrolytes, NMO hold a dominant position for a surface-controlled pseudocapacitive behavior in the low potential region (0–0.8 V), but when the potential is higher than 0.8 V, an intercalation pseudocapacitive behavior becomes dominant. NMO shows a battery-like behavior associated with OH− ions in an alkaline NaOH electrolyte, the charge storage mechanism of which strongly depends on the type of electrolyte, and even in the same electrolyte, different charging behaviors are revealed in different potential ranges.389

Besides SCs, the electrochemical energy storage process and mechanism of ion batteries are also widely discussed. The energy storage mechanism of a flexible ZIB assembled with Ce-doped MnO2 deposited on CC (Ce-MnO2@CC) as the cathode was monitored by in situ Raman. Through in situ Raman spectroscopy and other in situ characterization techniques, it is revealed that the storage mechanism of the Ce-doped MnO2 cathode is the reversible intercalation/deintercalation of Zn2+ and H+ and demonstrated that the structural shedding and dissolution of the MnO2 structure are the major factors in reducing capacity.390 Ni-doping induced structural distortion of MnO2 nanosheets for highly efficient Na+ storage was reported by Yao's group. In situ Raman spectra acquired at different charge/discharge states are exhibited in Fig. 24g. Three main bands centered at 443 (ν3), 575 (ν2) and 662 (ν1) cm−1 were identified. The ν1 band belongs to the Mn–O stretching vibration along the dz2 orbital of [MnO6] octahedra and the symmetric Mn–O stretching vibration of the MnO6 group.382 The ν2 band can be regarded as the Mn–O stretching vibration of [MnO6] octahedra along the plane of the dx2−y2 orbital. The ν3 band can be used to describe the interaction between atoms in a 1 × 2 tunnel. With the increase of potential, due to the generation of Mn(IV) during charging and the shortening of the Mn–O bond length along the dz2 orbital of [MnO6] octahedron, a gradually enhanced ν1 band appears, while the opposite process can be seen during discharging.391 At the same time, the increasing ν2 band during charging also indicates the contraction of Mn(IV) and Mn–O bonds along dx2−y2. In addition, during the charge/discharge cycle, the wave number shift of the ν2 band and the obvious intensity change of the ν3 band were not observed, which indicated that there was no expansion of the [MnO6] sheet and weakening of interatomic interaction in the 1 × 2 tunnel. The results show that the distorted Ni–MnO2 can effectively restrain and adjust the lattice stress, which may be the reason for the long-term cycling stability of Ni–MnO2.392
Although 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials have been widely used in EES devices, there is still no clear explanation as to how charges are efficiently stored in electrodes or transported through the electrolyte/electrode interface. Furthermore, Mn element has rich valence states, and valence state change and phase transitions often occur during electrochemical charging and discharging. Therefore, investigating these changes through in situ characterization is of great significance to fully understand 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials. The in situ XRD technique can dynamically observe the phase transition process of Mn-based materials, which is very helpful to accurately understand their energy storage process. The in situ XAS technique can provide a more accurate elucidation of the energy storage mechanism with Mn-based materials by characterizing the electrochemical reactions and kinetics. In situ Raman can detect changes in active electrode materials in pseudocapacitors during potential cycling, leading to further understanding of the structural evolution of the materials. However, due to the complexity of Mn-based materials, multiple in situ techniques can be used together for a more precise understanding.
9. Summary and outlook
In summary, this review primarily introduces the applications of 2D nanostructured Mn-based oxides, 2D nanostructured Mn-based hydroxide/layered double hydroxides and other 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials as electrode materials for EES. Due to high theoretical capacitance, abundant resources and low cost, 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials have been widely reported for SCs, LIBs, SIBs and multivalent metal-ion batteries. The influences of the crystal structure, synthesis methods and energy storage mechanism on the electrochemical performance have been intensively introduced. The relationship between the 2D morphology and electrochemical performance is also discussed. In addition, with the introduction of high conductive materials and some modification engineering of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials, the electrical conductivity and structural stability will be improved, further resulting in optimized electrochemical performance. Despite the significant progress achieved, the electrochemical performance of current 2D nanostructured Mn-based electrodes is still far from satisfactory storage and industrial applications. In view and analysis of the published literature, future research and perspectives are needed to address these issues, as detailed below:
(i) 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials have attracted immense attention due to their boosted pseudocapacitive behavior resulting from their large specific area providing abundant electrochemically active sites in electrochemical storage applications. However, the behaviors of re-stacking and/or agglomeration of 2D nanostructured materials restrain the ion diffusion. To decrease the capacitance loss, some 3D structures with large interlayer spacing and open channels can be designed by rationally adjusting the nanostructure. For instance, ultrathin 2D nanosheets with single layer or few layer thickness can show completely different electrochemical properties from their block counterparts. Also, assembling 2D Mn-based nanosheets with a heterogeneous material to form advanced nanostructure such as 3D flower-like or core–shell nanoarrays also enables enhanced cycle stability and accelerated ion diffusion.
(ii) The main problems of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials for practical applications are their low intrinsic electrical conductivity and poor cycle stability. The study incorporates some high conductivity materials such as carbon, MXenes and LDH materials to form 2D nanostructured Mn-based composites, aiming at enhancing their conductivity. Furthermore, the defect engineering of ionic vacancies and atom substitution doping are introduced to boost the structural stability. However, there still exist several problems. The range of these composites is relatively narrow. Thus, Mn-based materials should be composited with more compounds, such as conductive polymers, metal oxides and organic compounds.
(iii) The Jahn–Teller effect of Mn3+ introduces local plastic deformation and volume distortion during cycling. The distortion will increase the trend of the disproportionation reaction of Mn3+ ions generating Mn4+ and Mn2+ ions further resulting in the loss of the active material owing to the soluble nature of Mn2+ ions. At present, the countermeasures for suppressing the dissolution of Mn2+ is adding inorganic salts containing Mn2+ ions into the electrolyte to tailor the Mn2+ ion dissolution equilibrium. To realize the practical utilization of Mn-based materials, more efforts are required to solve the problem.
(iv) 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials possess better electrochemical performance than other one dimensional nanowires or three dimensional nanospheres. However, the research on 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials mainly focuses on MnO2. There are few reports about other 2D nanostructured Mn-based oxides/hydroxides for LIBs, SIBs and multivalent metal-ion batteries. Especially, for SIBs, the effect of the crystal structure of Mn-based materials on the electrochemical performance has been intensively studied, while the effect of the morphology on the electrochemical performance has been neglected.
(v) Because of the multi-electron transfer capability of multivalent MIBs, they can supply high theoretical gravimetric and volumetric energy densities. Currently, the application of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials in multivalent MIBs is mainly concentrated on ZIBs. Other multivalent MIBs, such as magnesium-, calcium- and aluminum-ion batteries, also need to be investigated.
In conclusion, 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials as promising materials for energy storage applications are desirable in view of their low cost, eco-friendliness and high theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, the problem of stacking, poor conductivity and unsatisfactory structural stability of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials hinder their application. Given the reported tremendous advances, we propose some strategies to alleviate the influence and improve the capacity as well as cycling stability, and there are still lots of challenges to realize the practical application. Therefore, the combination of multiple strategies can be considered. Moreover, some emerging fields of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials are still worthy of extensive exploration, such as using advanced characterization techniques to accurately understand the charge storage mechanism and phase transition of 2D nanostructured Mn-based materials.
