As an indispensable part of these batteries, solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) with excellent mechanical strength and non-flammability play a significant role in suppressing the growth of dendrites and eliminating the risk of short circuits, whose development could greatly promote the overall battery performance. Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), a type of porous crystalline inorganic–organic material, have shown potential for the fabrication of high-performance SSEs, which have become an emerging research direction. Benefiting from the rich porosity, controllable functionality and modularity, MOFs not only offer great opportunities for manipulating the physicochemical and electrochemical properties of SSEs, but also provide ideal platforms for investigating the underlying mechanisms of ion conduction and the structure–property relationships. In this perspective, the development of MOF-based SSEs, which include MOF-incorporated polymer hybrids, ionic liquid-laden MOF hybrids, and neat MOFs as SSEs, is outlined. By discussing the pioneering works, both the opportunities and challenges in each SSE category are presented. Additionally, some design principles for MOFs and MOF-based SSEs, as well as the future directions for further development are provided.

Introduction
On account of the long-standing and ever-growing energy demand worldwide, the exploration of renewable energies (e.g., solar and wind energies) and the development of power-dense energy storage systems (ESSs) are paramount.1 As one representative EES, rechargeable batteries have been widely used in our daily life as the power source for various portable electronics over the past few decades. Currently, to satisfy the booming market for electric vehicles and meet the requirement for grid-scale energy storage, high-performance batteries with high energy density, reliable safety and cycling stability are under intensive exploration and triggering numerous research interests.2,3
Advanced next-generation batteries based on metallic anodes (e.g., Li, Na, Mg, or Zn) show promise as candidates to fulfill society's demands in view of their high-energy anode materials. The low standard reduction potential or the multi-electron redox process of these metal elements offers impressive theoretical volumetric capacity, making exciting possibilities for harvesting intensified power.4,5 Unfortunately, these metal-based batteries are facing great challenges, among which the potential safety concerns and cycling degradation are the top two obstacles. For example, in Li-ion and Na-ion batteries, the utilization of metallic anodes will inevitably accelerate the formation of Li or Na dendrites, which may puncture the seperators during cycling and may eventually cause a short circuit.6–9 More seriously, if the electrolyte is a flammable liquid, possible leakage and overheating in batteries may happen and result in a catastrophic fire or explosion. As for batteries based on multivalent metals (e.g., Mg or Zn), despite of the advantages of natural abundance and geopolitical availability, these metallic anodes (e.g., Mg or Zn) could undergo a multi-electron transfer (e.g., Mg2+/Mg or Zn2+/Zn) process and thus have superiority in achieving high volumetric energy densities. However, the passive films between the electrolyte and electrode, because of undesirable side reactions, together with the sluggish ion diffusion kinetics usually lead to unsatisfactory rate capability and inferior cycling stability, posing challenges to the practical applications.10,11 To alleviate the abovementioned issues, an optimal selection and modification of battery components can take effect, which holds great potential to enhance the electrochemical performances of these metal-anode-based batteries.
Being one of the key parts for energy-dense batteries, electrolytes serve as ionic conductors that enable ion transport between the anode and cathode. In a battery, the intrinsic features of electrolytes could affect the electrochemical processes, thus dominating the overall cell performance.12 Compared with conventional liquid electrolytes, which usually suffer from irreversible decomposition, high flammability and leakage issues, solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) with their high modulus and stability hold much promise for the development of safe and high-energy batteries. SSEs have been investigated with great effort during the past few decades, and show superior advantages over liquid electrolytes in many aspects.6,10,13–15 Firstly, SSEs as solid materials have no leakage problems. Secondly, SSEs that have high electrochemical stability offer possibilities to expand the working temperature and potential window. Thirdly, most SSEs demonstrate much higher transference number of metal ions than liquid electrolytes, which could address the concentration polarization issues in batteries. Furthermore, SSEs could suppress the self-discharge process and improve the capacity retention of batteries to some extent.16 It has been accepted that the self-discharge phenomenon can be attributed to the side reactions between electrolytes and electrodes, as well as the inner micro-short circuit.17,18 Compared with liquid electrolytes, SSEs with high mechanical rigidity and stability are superior in restraining the growth of moss-like Li dendrites and suppressing the redox reaction with electrodes. The depressed dendrite formation and side reactions by SSEs could effectively reduce the possibility of micro-short circuits and the loss of mobile cations, resulting in low self-discharge rate and high capacity retention.
Up to now, there are many kinds of SSEs, among which inorganic ceramic electrolytes and composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) are the most studied.10,16,19 Inorganic ceramic electrolytes can be further classified into several categories, such as oxide-based electrolytes, with perovskite or garnet structure, and sulfide-based electrolytes. These materials typically exhibit excellent mechanical robustness and reasonable ionic conductivity, but suffer from poor interfacial contact or unsatisfactory instability.20 Among these inorganic categories, sulfide-based SSEs attract much research interest.21 In sulfide-based SSEs, the high polarization of S2− anions can effectively weaken the interactions between Li+ and the anionic sublattice, resulting in a relatively high ionic conductivity.21,22 Besides, their reasonable ductility can reduce the interfacial/interparticle resistance, which is favorable for battery operation. However, sulfide-based SSEs are still facing many challenges, such as their poor stability and narrow voltage window.21,23 Most sulfide-based SSEs are unstable with moisture. The hygroscopy of sulfides and the release of toxic H2S not only cause handling problems, but also impede their practical commercialization. In addition, sulfide-based SSEs could undergo redox reactions when paired with Li metal or high-voltage LiCoO2 cathodes. The poor electrochemical stability of sulfide-based SSEs severely limits the operating voltage window, and thus restricts their applications in high-energy batteries. Research focusing on the construction of artificial layers or modification of surface properties holds great potential to enhance the interface stability. Another representative type of SSE is CPEs, which are typically composed of polymer matrices, solid fillers, metal salts, and plasticizers. CPEs are advantageous in terms of their easy processing (e.g., shaping and pattering), low cost, high flexibility and good interfacial contact.19 However, CPEs suffer from inferior mechanical strength due to their low elastic moduli, as well as low ionic conductivity at room temperature, impeding their practical applications. Previous works showed that these issues could be alleviated to some degree by a judicious selection and precise design of solid fillers. The filler-polymer and filler-salt interactions could facilitate both mobility of polymer chains and the dissociation of metal salts, thus benefiting the ultimate battery performance.19,24 To achieve an excellent battery performance, efforts have been devoted to optimizing the components/structures of the above-mentioned electrolyte systems or pursuing new formulations of electrolytes.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), also known as porous coordination polymers, are a rapidly growing class of porous crystalline inorganic–organic materials assembled by metal ions/clusters and organic ligands.25–27 MOFs have been recognized as excellent platforms for designing various functional materials via host–guest chemistry or reaction transformation, and widely investigated in the fields of gas adsorption, drug delivery, catalysis, energy storage and so on.4,27–30 More recently, the application of MOFs in SSE systems has emerged as a new research hotspot and has attracted considerable attention on the basis of their insulating character and intrinsic features.19,31–34 The variabilities of chemical compositions, pore structures, and surface functionalities endow MOFs with high designability, which offers great opportunities for manipulating the physicochemical properties of MOFs and thus pursuing high-performance SSEs. Briefly speaking, the merits of MOFs for SSEs are summarized as follows (Fig. 1).19,31–33 Firstly, the extraordinarily high surface area of MOFs could benefit the sufficient contact with other components, while their controllable surface polarity enables the modulation of Lewis acid–base interactions in the hybrid systems. These features provide possibilities for the optimization of overall electrochemical properties (e.g., ion mobility and ion transference number). Secondly, the periodical crystalline structure with rich porosity offers homogeneously dispersed sites and well-defined pathways for ion diffusion, demonstrating great advantages over conventional non-porous solids. Thirdly, the microporous feature and ordered channels could help improve the uniformity of cation plating upon the charging/discharging process, which will promote the formation of a stabilized interfacial layer and improve the cycling stability. Fourthly, MOFs with tunable porous structures (pore size, pore shape, and pore polarity) could act as ion sieves that preferentially promote cation transfer. Furthermore, the unsatisfactory impurities and by-products in the system could be trapped due to the high surface energy and strong adsorption ability of MOFs, suppressing the side reactions. Overall, the modular nature of MOFs in terms of compositions, structures and internal environments is a powerful property that provides feasibility for the design of battery-specific SSEs.

In this perspective, we outline the progress of MOF-based SSEs in rechargeable batteries. The roles of MOFs in SSEs are discussed in three different systems (Fig. 1): (1) MOF-incorporated polymer hybrids as SSEs; (2) ionic liquid (IL)-laden MOF hybrids as SSEs; (3) neat MOFs as SSEs. By discussing the significant milestones in each SSE system, both the merits and issues arising from MOFs are emphasized, together with the possible solutions for future research. In the end, fundamental guidelines and the outlook for the development of MOF-based SSEs with reliable safety and high-performance are present.
MOF-incorporated polymer hybrids as SSEs
As one type of CPE, MOF-incorporated polymer hybrids consist of metal salts, polymer matrices, MOF fillers, and sometimes liquid plasticizers. In the composites, part of the metal salts dissociate into ions as charge carriers, while the polymer matrices provide hopping sites for ion transport via segmental motion. Incorporation of MOF fillers or liquid plasticizers could effectively increase both the dissociation of metal salts and the segmental mobility of polymers. The enhanced mobile ions and migration pathways then contribute to an improved ionic conductivity.28,32,35 The rich variety and feasible functionality of MOFs pave the way for the rational design of adequate functional fillers, which are a prerequisite for fabricating high-performance SSEs.
The utilization of MOFs as solid fillers in CPEs is an emerging research area. Previous studies on conventional inorganic fillers (e.g., SiO2 or Al2O3) reveal that the physicochemical properties of solid fillers play an important role in determining the electrochemical behaviors of CPEs.36–38 The construction of a porous structure, the modification of the surface properties, and the enhancement of the surface area have proved to be effective to improve the CPEs’ performance.36–38 From this point of view, MOFs with tunable porosity, flexible functionalization, and large surface area are more advantageous for CPEs. Specifically as follows: (1) the pre-designed pore structures (e.g., pore diameter, pore shape) of MOFs allow the selective confinement of anions though the dimensional differences. (2) the tunable surface functionalities (e.g., Lewis acidity, polarity) promise a preferential anchoring of anions via chemical interactions. (3) The ultrahigh surface area of MOFs enables a more sufficient contact with metal salts and polymers than conventional fillers, benefiting a higher ionic conductivity.
An early work by Liu and co-workers reported the incorporation of MOF-5 (Zn4O(BDC)3, BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) into a lithium bis (trifluoromethysulfonyl)imide (denoted as LiTFSI or LiTFSA) and poly(ethylene oxide) (denoted as PEO) matrix to produce a CPE by an in situ method.39 When the molar ratio of ethylene oxide to Li was fixed to 10:1, the addition of MOF-5 (10 wt%) could obviously enhance the ionic conductivity from 7.36 × 10−6 to 3.16 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 25 °C. The authors speculated that the Lewis acidic sites on MOF-5 interacted with the alkoxide of the PEO chains and anions of the lithium salt, which accelerated both the movement of PEO chains and salt dissociation (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, MOF-5 could adsorb the trace solvents in CPE due to its porous feature and formed a facilitated passage for ion transport, accounting for the improved ionic conductivities (Fig. 2a). The scavenging ability of MOF-5 could further trap the impurities, if any, within inter pores, which prevented the possible side reactions at the Li/CPE interface. The improved interfacial properties resulted in lower interfacial resistance and better stability when compared with the MOF-free counterpart. The upper limit of the electrochemically stable potential window was 4.57 V (versus Li/Li+) at 60 °C, above which the oxidation of MOF-5 might occur. Moreover, MOF-5 is more lightweight than conventional ceramic fillers, which are expected to render higher energy density. In a Li/CPE/LiFePO4 cell at 60 °C, capacities of 143, 141, 138, and 132 mA h g−1 were observed at 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 1C, respectively, verifying the effectiveness of MOF-5 fillers for batteries. Afterward, MIL-53(Al) (AlO4(OH)(BDC)), which is built up by corner-sharing AlO4(OH)2 octahedra and BDC ligands, was applied and studied as a functional filler for CPEs by the same group.40 Compared with MOF-5, MIL-53(Al) had remarkable stability towards water and oxygen, which successfully raised the oxidation potential of the corresponding PEO-MIL-53(Al)-LiTFSI electrolyte to 5.10 V at 120 °C. In a LiFePO4/PEO-MIL-53(Al)-LiTFSI/Li cell, a high discharge capacity of 136.4 mA h g−1 was maintained at 5C and 120 °C after 300 cycles, highlighting the outstanding high-rate performance and stability (Fig. 2b).

In other representative works, Stephan and co-workers prepared and studied a series of CPEs incorporated with various MOF fillers, including magnesium-benzene tricarboxylate (namely, Mg-BTC) MOF,41 aluminium(III)-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (namely, Al-BTC) MOF,42 copper-benzenedicarboxylate (namely, Cu-BDC) MOF,43 nickel-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (namely, Ni-BTC) MOF,44 aluminium terephthalate (namely, Al-TPA) MOF,35 magnesium-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (namely, Mg-TPA) MOF,45 and magnesium-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (namely, Mg-TMA) MOF.45 In different CPE systems, a similar tendency towards higher ionic conductivity was observed upon the introduction of MOF fillers. The exact performance, which depended on the intrinsic nature of the fillers, could be altered by adjusting the features of MOFs, such as chemical compositions and surface polarities. As an example, a novel CPE, comprised of Mg-BTC MOF, PEO, and LiTFSI, was synthesized via a simple hot-press technique and investigated by assembling a full battery.41 It was discovered that the addition of Mg-BTC MOF could enhance the thermal stability via the intercalation/exfoliation processes between PEO and Mg-BTC nanoparticles. The decomposition temperature rose from around 190 to 290 °C, indicating the suppressed thermal degradation phenomenon. The glass transition temperature (Tg) also showed a slight increase when Mg-BTC MOF was incorporated into the system (Fig. 2c). The Lewis acidic sites of Mg-BTC MOF could interact with the PEO moiety and thus restricted the segmental motion, which contributed to the improved Tg and reduced crystallinity. With the contents of Mg-BTC MOF and LiTFSI both being 10%, the as-obtained CPE showed an outstanding ionic conductivity that was more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than the MOF-free counterparts. Furthermore, the activation energy calculated was obviously lowered via incorporating Mg-BTC MOF, suggesting the different transport mechanisms for Li+. In a Li/CPE/Li symmetric cell, the CPE containing Mg-BTC MOF was more compatible with reduced interfacial resistance. It was suggested that a layer of Mg-BTC MOF could be formed at the electrode surface, which minimized the contact areas between the Li anode and PEO matrix, thus impeding electrode reactions. Additionally, a relatively stable discharge capacity of 110 mA h g−1 could be obtained in a Li/CPE/LiFePO4 cell at 1C and 70 °C.
Recently, Sun and co-workers synthesized a cationic MOF (denoted as CMOF), and dispersed them into PEO/LiTFSI matrices to produce the P@CMOF electrolyte.46 The prototype MOF chosen was UiO-66 (Zr6O4(OH)4(BDC)6), which is constructed from Zr6O4(OH)4 octahedra and BDC ligands. By partially substituting BDC ligands with 2-aminoterephthalic acid and 2,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid, an isostructural MOF, namely D-UiO-66-NH2, could be formed (Fig. 2d). After reacting with CH3I, the pyridine N in D-UiO-66-NH2 turned to –N+CH3. And then the CMOF was formed. In P@CMOF, the cationic surface of CMOF and its high surface area (1082 m2 g−1) could effectively immobilize anions by electrostatic interactions. Accordingly, P@CMOF demonstrated a high Li+ transference number of 0.72, which was superior to those incorporated with conventional solid fillers (e.g., Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2, BaTiO3, Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12, Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3) (Fig. 2d). The higher Li+ transference number of P@CMOF could guide the uniform distribution of Li+, which suppressed the Li dendrite formation and enabled a stable interface. Moreover, the functional group of –NH2 could interact with the ether oxygen atoms on the PEO chains via hydrogen bonds, which contributed to the high stability of P@CMOF at a high voltage of 4.13 V. The as-assembled Li symmetrical cell could be cycled for 400 h with a nearly constant polarization voltage of 0.017 V at 0.1 mA cm−2 at 60 °C. In a Li/P@CMOF/LiFePO4 cell at 60 °C, the discharge capacity was 141.2, 126.4, 88.0 and 67.4 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.5, 2 and 5C, respectively. The capacity could be retained as high as 85.4% after cycling for 300 cycles at 1C. The excellent battery performance could be ascribed to the anion-adsorption effect of P@CMOF and the resultant dendrite-free surface on the Li electrode. This work successfully improved the ionic conductivity and battery performance of CPEs via the optimization and modification of MOF ligands. The feasible controllability and pre-designable functionality of MOFs provide new strategies for the synthesis of advanced MOF fillers.
Compared with conventional solid fillers like inorganic ceramics, systematic investigations on MOFs as functional fillers are relatively scarce. The current challenges and underlying opportunities are summarized as follows: Typically, MOF-incorporated CPEs are fabricated by mixing polymers, MOFs and metal salts in solvents, followed by solvent removal and sometimes hot pressing.35,41–45,47 Despite the simplicity of the prevailing method, the agglomeration of MOF fillers severely limits the further performance improvement. The optimization of synthetic methods is expected to achieve a better distribution of MOF fillers within the polymer matrix. Through referring to the existing research achievement in conventional solid fillers (e.g., TiO2, LiAlO2), there are several possible strategies to alleviate the agglomeration of MOF particles in CPEs. One method is to construct MOF-based nanofibers as one-dimensional fillers. Previous studies on Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 nanofibers,48 Li0.33La0.557TiO3 nanofibers,49 SiO2 nanofibers,50 and so on revealed that the nanofibrous structure could significantly enhance the ionic conductivity and stability of the CPEs. Taking advantage of the electrospinning technology, MOF-based nanofibers could be fabricated and favor the uniform dispersion of MOF nanoparticles without agglomeration. Another method is to fabricate MOF-based aerogels as three-dimensional fillers. Cui and co-workers once reported a novel SiO2 aerogel-reinforced CPE, which exhibited high modulus and high ionic conductivity (0.6 mS cm−1 at 30 °C).51 Similarly, MOF-based aerogels, whose interconnected skeleton enables the high dispersity and stability of MOF nanoparticles, also offer great possibilities to strengthen the whole CPEs with improved ionic conductivities. Previous reviews focusing on the hybridization of MOFs and polymers are favorable and may offer appropriate strategies towards obtaining the desired MOF–polymer composites.52 The content of MOF fillers is another crucial parameter that affects the physicochemical properties of the CPE system. In most reports, the content of MOF fillers is confined to 10 wt% irrespective of MOF types.35,41–43,45 Attempts with different concentration ratios need to be made for optimal recipes. As for the influence of the particle size and morphology, prior works on inorganic fillers may supply some references for future modulations.24,53 Since the interactions between MOFs and polymer matrices, as well as those between MOFs and metal salts, are significant factors, explorations on the fabrication of MOFs with distinct surface polarities are meaningful. In particular, MOFs with coordinatively unsaturated sites are one of the most promising types.
Presently, most works are restricted to PEO-based CPEs. Exploration of other polymers is expected.54 Moreover, the integration of multi-type polymers can be a way to cooperatively enhance the ionic conductivity while maintaining the mechanical and electrochemical stability.54 In this case, the system will become more complex due to the ambiguous interactions among the multiple components, which would make it difficult for the clarification of ionic-conducting mechanisms, structure–property relationships, and property-directed rational design. In addition, it has been demonstrated that introducing organic solvents as plasticizers could enhance the ionic conductivity, but at the expense of mechanical stability. To some extent, this issue could be alleviated by the addition of MOFs. Further works on the integration of MOFs with liquid plasticizers have good prospects to produce high-performance SSEs via synergistic effects. Moreover, considering the flexibility of the polymer matrix and the porosity of MOF fillers, MOF-incorporated CPEs have great prospects to serve as modification layers between electrodes and traditional inorganic electrolytes to achieve a better interfacial contact. Previous works that combined the polymer layers with ceramics to form a sandwich electrolyte will give some hints.55 Finally, an in-depth investigation by theoretical simulations and experimental tests is expected for a better understanding of the structure–property relationships.
IL-laden MOFs as SSEs
ILs, which are composed entirely of ions with a melting point of less than 100 °C, have gained intensive attention as a fascinating type of green solvent over the past few decades.56 Compared with conventional organic solvents, ILs have many remarkable properties, including high solubility, high ionic conductivity, negligible volatility, non-flammability, and high thermal/electrochemical stability.56 Encapsulation of ILs into porous materials, in particular, MOFs, is a powerful strategy to achieve advanced properties by combining the advantages of both components.57 Considering the richness and diversity of MOFs and ILs, a great variety of IL-incorporated MOF composites (denoted as IL@MOF) could be obtained, which have been widely studied in the fields of catalysis, gas adsorbents, electrochemistry, and so on.57–59
Recently, the application of IL@MOF as a new and environmentally benign ionic conductor in electrochemical devices has become an emerging research area with considerable attention.60–69 Owing to the high porosity and surface-to-volume ratio, MOFs could behave as outgoing reservoirs for ILs via a strong absorptive capability.59 Thus, ILs could keep their merits without the risk of leakage, which is a basic necessity for the fabrication of SSEs. The open channels in MOFs can further benefit the interfacial contact with electrodes to boost metal-ion transport for practical application in batteries.64,70 The narrow meso- and micropores in MOFs give rise to a confinement effect on ILs and thus affect the ion diffusion performance of ILs. In addition, the interaction between the polar surfaces of MOFs and the ions of ILs allows for the selective bonding of ions, which inevitably affects the ionic conductivity and transference number of the hybrid composites.59,63 Considering the diverse metal ions/clusters and organic ligands as building blocks, as well as the flourished post-synthetic methods, MOFs show variability and controllability in terms of the surface polarity and pore structure, which are advantageous for performance-oriented material design.59
To synthesize IL@MOF composites, the stability of MOFs toward ILs is of primary importance, which is the basic criterion for MOF selection. Besides, the size, shape, and chemical environment of MOF pores should be taken into consideration, since these features dominate not only the synthetic processes, but also the overall properties of IL@MOF composites.57–59 Generally, strategies to form IL@MOF composites can be classified into several categories,58 including (1) the post-impregnation approach wherein the pre-synthesized MOFs are soaked in ILs or IL-containing solutions, (2) capillary action-promoted diffusion that involves the physical mixing and subsequent annealing of stoichiometric amounts of MOFs and ILs, and (3) the “ship-in-bottle” method wherein the precursors of an IL are introduced into the MOF pores and then assembled to give an IL inside the MOF pore. Up to now, the experimentally or theoretically studied MOFs for IL incorporation include:59 (1) UiO-67, which possesses octahedral and tetrahedral cages with diameters of 1.6 and 1.2 nm; (2) MIL-101, which has two types of spherical cages (diameters of 3.4 and 2.9 nm) with hexagonal and pentagonal windows (diameters of 1.47 and 1.2 nm); (3) MOF-525 with the aperture size of 1.2 × 0.7 nm; (4) ZIF-8 whose pore aperture and cavity diameter are 0.34 and 1.16 nm; (5) HKUST-1 with 0.9 nm channels, 0.5 nm tetrahedral-shaped cavity, and 0.3 nm triangular window; (6) MOF-5 whose pore aperture and cavity diameter are 0.78 and 1.5 nm; (7) UiO-66, MOF-74, etc. As for ILs, the most studied cations include large asymmetric 1-alkyl-3-methyl-imidazolium, N-alkyl-pyridnnium, etc., which are balanced by organic anions (e.g., TSFI−, PF6−) or inorganic anions (e.g., Cl−, Br−). It has been reported that multiple interactions exist between ILs and MOFs, including coulombic forces, van der Waals interactions, π–π interactions, hydrogen-bonding, coordination interaction, etc.58 These strong interactions can facilitate the capillary adsorption and dispersion of ILs within MOFs. When designing IL@MOF composites, structural information, such as the sizes of ILs, pore apertures of MOFs, and coordination conditions of MOFs, is useful and should be considered.
Studies on IL@MOF reveal that MOFs can change the phase behavior of confined ILs, which leads to a higher ionic conductivity than that of bulk ILs at low temperature.61–63,71 In 2014, Kitagawa and co-workers reported the first example of an IL@MOF, which consisted of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide (denoted as EMI–TFSA, or EMIM–TFSI) and ZIF-8 (Fig. 3a).71 After physical mixing and subsequent heating of EMI–TFSA and ZIF-8, the flowable EMI–TFSA was supposed to be encapsulated within the pores of ZIF-8. Considering the pore sizes (1.16 nm) and aperture (0.34 nm) of ZIF-8,72 as well as the sizes of [TFSA]− (0.79 × 0.29 nm) and [EMI]+ (0.76 × 0.43 nm),73 the possible ways for ILs to be adsorbed within ZIF-8 were supposed as follows. For [TFSA]−, its shortest dimension (0.29 nm) is relatively smaller than the aperture (0.34 nm) of ZIF-8. The [TFSA]− may firstly adjust their orientation so as to enter the ZIF-8 pores longitudinally. Thus [TFSA]− could be embedded within the pores of ZIF-8 via the preferential directional movement. For [EMI]+, its ionic size is larger than the pore aperture of ZIF-8, which makes the diffusion of [EMI]+ into ZIF-8 pores seem difficult. However, considering the framework flexibility of ZIF-8,74–77 there are two possible ways for [EMI]+ to be encapsulated within ZIF-8 pores. One possible way relies on the swing effect of the imidazolate ligands in ZIF-8,74,76 which has been proved in previous studies of gas adsorption. At elevated temperatures, the swing effect might lead to structural changes, including the expansion of the aperture size in ZIF-8, which allows the passage of larger [EMI]+ into the framework. The other way for encapsulating [EMI]+ depends on the possible formation of short-lived defective frameworks with “open” pores. Previous studies revealed that the pore aperture of ZIF-8 can be “opened” via ligand dissociation, which could lead to the diffuse of large molecules into the ZIF-8 pores.77 Similarly, the possible dissociative ligands and resultant defective frameworks with “open” pores in ZIF-8 might allow the adsorption of larger [EMI]+ in ZIF-8 pores. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curve of bulk EMI–TFSA exhibited sharp peaks at 257 and 231 K, corresponding to the melting and freezing points, while the solid-state 19F static nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra showed a sharp peak at temperatures above 273 K due to the free rotation and diffusion of the TFSA− anions (Fig. 3a). In contrast, no peaks appeared for the as-synthesized EMI–TFSA@ZIF-8 in the DSC curve, while gradually narrowing peaks appeared in NMR spectra at the temperature range of 123 to 303 K. The above results proved that ZIF-8 could prevent ILs from freezing to some extent. The amount of IL ions that is restricted in each ZIF-8 micropore was too small to form an ordered crystalline structure. When 50, 75, 100, and 125% of the ZIF-8 micropore volume was theoretically occupied by the EMI–TFSA, samples denoted as EZ50, EZ75, EZ100, and EZ125 were obtained. Compared with bulk EMI–TFSA, EMI–TFSA@ZIF-8 (including EZ50, EZ75, EZ100, and EZ125) exhibited different variations in terms of ionic conductivity during the heating process (Fig. 3b).62 The conductivity of bulk EMI–TFSA dropped steeply at temperatures below 264 K due to the strong intermolecular interactions and restricted ion mobility. Comparatively, there were no abrupt variations in conductivity for EZ50, EZ75, and EZ100, respectively at the low-temperature region due to the nonfreezing effect. At temperatures below 250 K, EZ100 exhibited superior ionic conductivity to bulk EMI–TFSA.

Later on, the same group introduced a Li-containing IL, (EMI0.8Li0.2)TFSA, into ZIF-8 to fabricate (EMI0.8Li0.2)TFSA@ZIF-8 composites and investigated their ionic conductivity.63 It was discovered that the ionic conductivity of (EMI0.8Li0.2)TFSA@ZIF-8 was around 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of bulk (EMI0.8Li0.2)TFSA, which was ascribed to the differences in ion concentrations. Notably, the activation energy for the self-diffusion coefficient of Li+ in (EMI0.8Li0.2)TFSA@ZIF-8 was comparable with the bulk (EMI0.8Li0.2)TFSA, suggesting that the Li+ ions diffuse through the micropores of ZIF-8 via the exchange of the solvating TFSA− anions, similar to the Grotthuss mechanism in proton conductivity. This pioneering work has significantly showed the potential utilization of Li-containing IL@MOF as SSEs for rechargeable batteries.
Another representative example reported the fabrication of Li-IL@MOF composites by mixing [EMIM0.8Li0.2][TFSI] (denoted as Li-IL) with MOF-525(Cu), and explored their electrochemical performances by assembling battery cells (Fig. 3c).70 The pore aperture of MOF-525(Cu) was around 1.2 × 0.7 nm, which was larger than the sizes of [EMIM]+ (0.76 × 0.43 nm) and [TFSI]− (0.79 × 0.29 nm). Thus, the Li-IL could be successfully introduced within the MOF pores via orientation adjustment and subsequent capillary action-promoted diffusion. Similar to the previous reports, the ionic conductivity of Li-IL@MOF varied significantly with the loading amount of Li-IL. When the ratio of Li-IL to MOF was fixed at 1.5 mL to 1.2 g, Li-IL@MOF exhibited high conductivities of 2.2 × 10−5, 3.0 × 10−4, and 4.9 × 10−3 S cm−1 at −20, 25, and 100 °C, respectively. The Li+ transference number for Li-IL@MOF was measured to be 0.36 at room temperature, obviously higher than that of bulk Li-IL (0.14). The authors ascribed the markable enhancement to the confinement of [EMIM]+ and [TFSI]− within the MOF pores, as well as the easiness for Li+ to pass through. This hypothesis seems to conflict with the findings by Kitagawa and co-workers, where the motion of Lewis acidic Li+ was suppressed by the strong bonding with [TFSA]− anions or the inner surface of ZIF-8.63 This discrepancy may come from the difference in the internal surface and pore structures between MOF-525(Cu) and ZIF-8. Thus, the intrinsic features of MOFs were important and should be given a comprehensive consideration for synthesizing advanced Li-containing IL@MOF SSEs. Besides the above-mentioned interactions and confinement effects, the highly porous MOF-525(Cu) with the confined Li-IL could benefit Li+ transport by forming rich interfacial connections. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggested that Li-IL preferentially occupied the near-surface region of MOFs. When pressed into a dense pellet, Li-IL@MOF was packed together and formed rich interfacial contacts via connections of the Li-IL. The abundant “nanowetted interfaces” at atomic level could improve the Li+ transport kinetics in Li-IL@MOF and contribute to a low interfacial resistance between Li-IL@MOF and the electrodes. In a Li/Li-IL@MOF/Li asymmetric cell, the reduced resistance could regulate Li deposition. The voltage profile remained stable over 1000 h with small polarization voltages of 40 and 70 mV at 0.05 and 0.2 mA cm−2, respectively, reflecting a stable interface between Li-IL@MOF and Li metal upon long-term Li plating/stripping cycling (Fig. 3c). Moreover, when integrated with a Li anode and a super-high active loading of 25 mg cm−2 and a 0.21 mm thick LiFePO4 cathode, the full cell demonstrated a high discharge capacity of 132 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1C under room temperature. The authors suggested that the “nanowetted interfaces” enabled by the Li-IL@MOF could enhance the Li+ conduction across the Li-IL@MOF and cathode. The as-formed fast interconnected Li+ pathway and the resultant low resistance accounted for such an excellent performance.
Shortly afterward, Pan and co-workers extended the concept of “nanowetted interfaces” to ceramic SSEs to address the interfacial issues.64 By impregnating a Li-containing IL (LiTFSI: [EMIM][TFSI] = 0.223 g: 1 mL, denoted as Li-IL) into UIO-67, a host–guest composite (Li-IL@MOF, denoted as LIM) was obtained and adopted as an assistant ionic conductor. The LIM was then integrated with garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) to form a hybrid SSE (Li-IL@MOF-LLZO, denoted as LIM-L).64 Owing to the opening channels and restricted Li-IL guest, LIM provided rich contact points with both LLZO (Fig. 3d) and electrodes at atomic scale, which changed the original solid–solid contact into “nanowetted interfaces” to facilitate Li+ transport. When 20 wt% LIM was added, the LIM-L showed a high ionic conductivity of 1.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C, obviously surpassing that of pristine LLZO (1.5 × 10−6 S cm−1). The electrochemical window was as wide as 5.2 V, enabling application in batteries containing high-voltage cathodes. Moreover, the LIM ionic conductor could be introduced to the cathodes, including LiCoO2 (LCO) and LiFePO4 (LFP), to favor Li+ transport via the three-dimensional conductive networks. The efficient Li+ pathways inside the batteries enabled an acceptable rate capability and reasonable cycling stability with the ultra-high loadings of LCO and LFP reaching 15.9 and 12.4 mg cm−2, respectively, presenting a promising approach to safe and high-power energy storage (Fig. 3d).
Taking advantage of each component, the integration of Li-IL@MOF composites with inorganic ceramics or hybrid polymer electrolytes is a promising strategy to further optimize the electrochemical performance of SSEs. For example, Li-IL@MOF may functionalize as new fillers to interact with the polymer matrix, offering new possibilities to produce high-performance hybrid polymer electrolytes.66 However, there are few reports on this research direction. These hybrid SSEs are usually very complicated, where various interactions, such as coulombic interactions, van der Waals forces, and π–π interactions, co-exist. In this situation, clarifying the distributions and diffusivity of ions in MOF frameworks is a great challenge.
In the present stage, although various IL@MOF systems have been successfully synthesized,58 research on IL@MOFs as SSEs and investigations on their battery performance are still insufficient. It has been proved that MOFs with high designability could efficiently tune the intermolecular interactions of ions, and thus control the phase behavior and ionic conductivity of ILs.58–63,68,71,78 These pioneer works reveal the great prospect of IL@MOFs to be used as electrolytes for batteries in a low-temperature region. In future studies, assembling of IL@MOFs into symmetric cells or full cells is a necessity to study the compatibility and stability with the electrodes. Additionally, it is strongly recommended to calculate the transference number of cations in IL@MOFs, since it plays a crucial role in determining the concentration polarization, interfacial properties, and thus cycling stability and rate capability.
Metal ion conduction in neat MOFs
In this part, MOFs with internal mobile ions and possibly existing solvents (e.g., propylene carbonate (PC), ethylene carbonate (EC), diethyl carbonate (DEC)) are discussed and investigated as SSEs for batteries. Considering the diversity of MOFs and the development of nanotechnology,79–82 MOFs with desirable pore structures and surface functionalities can be designed, which offers great opportunities for systematic optimization of electrolyte performance. However, when compared with the extensive studies on pure MOFs as electrodes reflexing their abilities to intercalate metal ions,4,83–88 research works that focus on pure MOF for SSEs are emerging, but far from enough.
To achieve the hoped-for ion transportation within MOFs, the corresponding target metal ions should be firstly introduced within MOF hosts. The commonly used strategies include: (1) host–guest encapsulations by immersing MOFs in salt solutions, followed by filtration and drying processes;89–91 (2) post-synthetic modifications of MOFs to form anionic frameworks with charge-balancing mobile cations, which may require tedious procedures and severe conditions.92–95 Different from ILs, metal salts are composed of smaller ions whose size is much smaller than the pore apertures of MOFs. Thus, the pore confinement effect mainly influences the uptake amount of salts, while chemical interactions between MOFs and salts determine the ion mobility and transference numbers.90,96 Altering the surface polarity by ligand functionalization, changing the coordination mode by solvent removal, and enlarging the pore diameter by extending the ligand length offer immense possibilities in modulating the pore environment and interactions. Additionally, MOFs with designable modularity provide an ideal platform for investigating the underlying mechanisms of ion conduction and the structure–property relationships.
Some typical research works of neat MOFs as SSEs are summarized in Table 1. In a pioneering work by Long and co-workers, a series of MOFs, including MOF-177, Cu-BTTri, and Mg2(dobdc) (dobdc = 1,4-dioxido-2,5-benzenedicarboxylate), were incorporated with LiBF4, respectively, among which Mg2(dobdc) with coordinatively unsaturated Mg2+ was the most promising material.89 Upon uptake of LiBF4, a room-temperature conductivity of 1.8 × 10−6 S cm−1 was measured, which was too low to meet the technological limit for battery applications. The substitution of LiBF4 with lithium isopropoxide (LiiOPr) resulted in a higher ionic conductivity. The author speculated that the alkoxide anions might preferentially bind with Mg2+ sites of the framework and allow Li+ to move more freely along the channels. Activation energies of 0.31 and 0.14 eV were obtained for LiBF4- and LiiOPr-incorporated Mg2(dobdc), respectively, suggesting the different conduction mechanisms. The impregnation of both LiiOPr and LiBF4 within the MOFs produced a composite material with the formula of Mg2(dobdc)·0.35LiiOPr·0.25LiBF4·EC·DEC (Fig. 4a), which exhibited a high ionic conductivity of 3.1 × 10−4 S cm−1 and low activation energy of 0.15 eV. It was supposed that the presence of LiBF4 favored interparticle conductivity and stable interfacial contacts. Preliminarily, this work showed that MOFs with open metal sites (OMSs) had advantages as SSEs. Then the same group reported their research on UiO-66, which was functionalized via thermal dehydration and subsequently underwent a grafting procedure with lithium tert-butoxide (LiOtBu) to afford the LiOtBu-grafted UiO-66 (Fig. 4b).97 The former process exposed Zr4+ as OMSs, while the latter process again saturated the Zr4+ with alkoxide anions and accommodated charge-balancing Li+ ions within the MOF pores. The ionic conductivity of LiOtBu-grafted UiO-66 was 1.8 × 10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature. Benefiting from the grafting of tBuO−, the negative charge of tBuO− could be shielded by the bulky aliphatic groups, thus weakening the interaction between tBuO− and Li+. The enhanced Li+ mobility led to a low activation energy of 0.18 eV. Unsatisfactorily, the Li symmetrical cell was short-circuited only after three cycles due to dendrite formation that occurred along grain boundaries. Synthesis of larger MOF crystals and combination with polymeric binders are possible strategies to mitigate the issues originating from grain boundaries in the near future.

Long and co-workers further expanded their concept that the cation mobility could be enhanced via immobilizing counter anions on OMSs and constructed Mg2+-favored SSEs for an energy-dense Mg-ion battery.90 Considering the much larger radius of Mg2+ than that of Li+, MOFs with large pore apertures are required to ensure Mg2+ conductivity. With identical secondary building blocks and rich OMSs, Mg2(dobdc) and its expanded analogue Mg2(dobpdc) (dobpdc = 4,4′-dioxidobiphenyl-3,3′-dicarboxylate) were investigated as a host for Mg2+ mobilization (Fig. 4c). These isoreticular MOFs made it possible to study the influence of pore size on the ionic conductivity. The pore dimensions and volumes could affect not only the uptake amount of salts but also the surface polarities, which had a key impact on the propensity for Mg2+ incorporation. Besides, the basicity of the counter anions was proved to be another factor than determined the Mg2+ mobility (Fig. 4c). Compared with Mg2(dobdc), the larger organic linkers of Mg2(dobpdc) lowered the polarity of the framework. Owing to the weaker host–guest interactions, Mg(OPhCF3)2⊂Mg2(dobpdc) accommodated less amount of Mg(OPhCF3)2 and exhibited a lower ionic conductivity than that of Mg(OPhCF3)2⊂Mg2(dobdc). In contrast, the incorporation of Mg(TFSI)2, in which the [TFSI]− was a poor nucleophile, to Mg2(dobdc) and Mg2(dobpdc) gave the opposite results. The larger pore size and cell volume of Mg2(dobpdc) favored the uptake of Mg(TFSI)2, which was more than three times the mole equivalents than that of Mg2(dobdc). Remarkably, Mg(TFSI)2⊂Mg2(dobpdc) demonstrated a high ionic conductivity of approximately 10−4 S cm−1, which was two orders of magnitude higher than that of Mg(TFSI)2⊂Mg2(dobdc). The ionic conductivity of Mg2+ could be further improved by using dual salts. After soaking MOFs in both Mg(TFSI)2 and Mg(OPhCF3)2, advanced SSEs with a room-temperature conductivity of 0.1 mS cm−1 could be obtained (Fig. 4d). Further studies on the electrochemical stability and rate capability in battery cells are expected to ascertain their potential toward practical application.
Recently, Dunn and co-workers have also investigated the effect of OMSs and pore size of MOFs on the ionic conductivity. MOF-5 (Zn4O(BDC)), HKUST-1 (Cu3(BTC)2), MIL-100 MOFs (M3O(BTC)2OH (H2O)2, M = Al, Cr, or Fe), and UiO series were selected for this exploration.96 All the pristine MOFs were soaked in the presence of LiClO4 in PC, where anions spontaneously bind to the OMSs forming negatively charged channels for Li+ transport. The obtained SSEs were denoted as LPC@MOF, of which the ionic conductivities and activation energies were measured and compared in Fig. 5a. The essential role of OMSs was initially confirmed by comparison between MOF-5 and HKUST-1. MOF-5 had a similar pore diameter (1.2 nm) to that of HKUST-1 (1.1 nm). However, HKUST-1 possessed unsaturated OMSs, while MOF-5 did not. At room temperature, LPC@HKUST-1 showed an ionic conductivity of 3.8 × 10−4 S cm−1, which was much higher than that of LPC@MOF-5 (1.3 × 10−4 S cm−1). This enhancement could be attributed to the existence of OMSs in HKUST-1, which coordinated with counter anions to form negatively charged frameworks. MIL-100-Al, MIL-100-Cr, and MIL-100-Fe had identical pore structures but with different OMSs. It was found that the ionic conductivity of LPC@MIL-100 was consistent with Lewis acidity of OMSs (Al > Fe > Cr). MIL-100-Al exhibited the highest ionic conductivity exceeding 1 mS cm−1. The stronger acidity of Al3+ compared with Cr3+ and Fe3+ could weaken the ion-pairing strength between Li+ and [ClO4]−, thus enhancing Li+ transport. To explore the effect of pore size, UiO-66 and UiO-67 (Zr6O4(OH)4(BPDC)6, BPDC = biphenyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate) were adopted. They possessed the same topology and Zr4+ OMSs, but with different pore diameters (0.75 and 1.2 nm for UiO-66 versus 1.2 and 2.3 nm for UiO-67). The ionic conductivity for UiO-67 was higher than that of UiO-66 (0.65 versus 0.18 mS cm−1), which could be attributed to its larger pore channels that allow a higher extent of solvation and easy mobility of Li+.

Anions could be coordinated to MOF frameworks, spontaneously leaving mobile metal cations within the porous tunnels. With the enhancement in the driving force for binding anions to MOFs, free cations can become the main charge carriers that dominate the ionic conductivity. When the cation transference number approaches 1, the so-called “single-ion” SSEs are obtained. The fixed anions and mobile cations in these “single-ion” SSEs not only eliminate the polarization effects that are present in liquid electrolytes, but also effectively avoid the parasitic reactions with electrodes.98–101 MOFs with designable binding sites and structural variability are excellent platforms for exploring “single-ion” SSEs. A representative work by Dincă and co-workers reported the utilization of an anionic MIT-20 to synthesize single-ion Li+, Na+, and Mg2+ SSEs.94 Removal of one equivalent of dimethylammonium chloride produced neutral MIT-20d, which underwent a reversible transition to form the anionic framework upon reaction with metal halides. Treatment of MIT-20d with LiCl or LiBr followed by a solvent exchange afforded the isostructural MIT-20-LiCl and MIT-20-LiBr, respectively. The transference number of MIT-20-LiCl was as high as 0.66, which obviously surpassed the values for liquid electrolytes, typically less than 0.4,102 proving the Li+-dominated ionic conduction. Compared with MIT-20-LiCl, MIT-20-LiBr with less Li+ content exhibited much higher ionic conductivity due to the less electronegative Br− and weaker interactions with Li+ (Fig. 5b). Additionally, by using MgBr2 and NaSCN as the corresponding salts, MIT-20-Mg and MIT-20-Na were fabricated, which exhibited reasonable ionic conductivity. The ability to reconstitute MOFs in various types of metal salts allows the modulation of the ion-pairing strength and ion conduction with variable cations, offering a versatile template for the application-directed design of SSEs.
The concept that MOFs with reversible transitions between neutral and anionic phase can be promising candidates for SSEs was further proved by utilizing a Cu-azolate MOF (Cu4(ttpm)2·0.6CuCl2 (H4ttpm = tetrakis(4tetrazolylphenyl)methane)) for Li+ and Mg2+ conduction.95 the Cu-azolate MOF had multiple anion binding sites, and could react with metal halide salts (LiCl, LiBr, MgCl2, and MgBr2) to produce anionic frameworks balanced with mobile cations (Fig. 5c). The ionic conductivities of MOF-LiCl, MOF-LiBr, MOF-MgCl2, and MOF-MgBr2 were in the range of 10−4–10−5 S cm−1, depending on the anion identity. Remarkably, the Li+ transference number for MOF-LiCl was as high as 0.69, which was competitive with many SSEs and a remarkable enhancement upon liquid electrolytes. Comparatively, MOF-LiBr showed a lower transference number of 0.34, revealing the weaker strength between Cu2+ centers and Br−. The results suggested that the anion softness was an important factor, which not only impacted the ionic conductivity, but also dominated the transference number via the ion-pairing and grafting interactions. The anion species also affected the electrochemical performance of SSEs to some degree. MOF-LiCl had a higher potential window of 4.5 V compared to that of MOF-LiBr (3.5 V), which could be attributed to the partial oxidation of Br−. The potential of Cu-azolate MOF as SSEs for Mg2+ and Al3+ was also evaluated. The ionic conductivity and activation energy for MOF-MgBr2 were superior to those for MOF-MgCl2, in line with the trends observed for Li+ analogs. The successful accommodation of trivalent Al3+ further confirmed the ability of MOFs to fabricate SSEs for high-valence batteries.
MOFs as single-ion SSEs are advantageous in optimizing the interfacial contact with the electrolyte.92–94,103 Recently, Pan and co-workers reported a crystalline Zn2+ SSE (denoted as WZM SSE), which was fabricated by a post-synthetic modification of MOF-808 ([Zr6O4(OH)4(HCOO)6(BTC)2]) (Fig. 5d).92 The as-synthesized WZM SSE exhibited a high ionic conductivity of 2.1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C with a low activation energy of 0.12 eV and a high Zn2+ transference number of 0.93. Remarkably, WZM SSE demonstrated excellent compatibility with the Zn anode. The rich porosity of MOF-808 and highly concentrated [Zn(H2O)6]2+ ions produced a “nanowetted interface” between the Zn anode and SSE, which guided and restricted Zn deposition (Fig. 5d). Thus, a homogeneous and compact Zn deposition layer could be obtained, resulting in a stable Zn plating/stripping performance. A VS2/Zn battery that was assembled with WZM SSE, delivered a reversible capacity of 125 mA h g−1 over 250 cycles at 0.2 A g−1. The concept of a “nanowetted interface” was similar to the previous discussions in IL-incorporated SSEs,64,70 verifying the effectiveness and universal utility of MOFs in optimizing the interfacial contact. The residual solvents (e.g., PC, EC, DEC) in MOFs could improve the interparticle/interfacial contact and solvate the metal cations, which are favorable for ionic conduction. However, these residual solvents also cause some safety issues. Determined by thermogravimetric analysis or 1H NMR spectroscopy, the contents of the residual solvents in most MOF SSEs are approximately 40–55% of the total weight.89,90,93–96 The mobility of the residual solvents could be somewhat restricted within MOFs due to the rich porosity and high surface area. Reducing the content of residual solvents could be an effective way to further improve the battery safety, which could be achieved by high-temperature vacuum drying with prolonged time. It is worth noting that the removal of residual solvents might cause the collapse of the MOF structure and the decrease of the ionic conductivity of the MOF SSEs. An alternative strategy is to wrap the residual solvents firmly within MOF pores to avoid the risk of leakage, rather than overly reducing the solvent content. The leakage-free encapsulation of residual solvents with restricted mobility could be somewhat realized via the chemical interactions and the confinement effects from MOF pores. By ligand selection and functional modification, the pore sizes and surface properties of MOFs could be systematically tuned.79,104–106 The incorporation of the pre-design functional groups (e.g., polar clusters) in MOFs might enhance the adsorption of residual solvents via the host–guest interactions. In addition, the effusion of residual solvents could be further prevented by the post-modifications of the pore apertures, such as the grafting of side chains on the ligands. Thus, via precisely designed MOF pores with desired size and surface properties, the residual solvents could be effectively encapsulated without the leakage risks. This strategy holds promise to alleviate the safety issues of MOF SSEs while maintaining their high ionic conductivity, which is advantageous to strike a balance among the safety, stability, and electrochemical properties.
MOFs with OMSs have great prospects to modulate ion transportations for high-performance SSEs. Mostly, the OMSs in MOFs are initially occupied by solvent molecules. An activation process is needed to expose the coordinatively unsaturated cationic sites. When anions are mostly trapped by MOFs, the charge-balancing cations as mobile charge carries could dominate the conduction process, thus maximizing the cation transference numbers. The ionic mobility of metal cations mainly depends on the interaction between the anions and cations, and the interaction between MOFs and anions. These interactions are related with the softness of anions, the valence of cations, the ligand length, the Lewis acidity of metal centers in MOFs, and so on. In the future, a detailed connection between the pore size, pore polarity, and mobile ion identity is expected, which may provide guidance to combine better for promoting metal-ion transport in materials. It should be noted that although MOF-based SSEs exhibit high mechanical strength, they may also face the issue of Li dendrite penetration upon battery cycling. In inorganic electrolytes (e.g., β-Li3PS4, Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 and Li6.55Ga0.15La3Zr2O12), it has been proved that Li dendrite accumulation and crack propagation can happen at the grain boundaries, surface defects, and interconnected pores, especially under high current densities.107–109 These research results can be also applicable to MOFs to some extent. Previous studies on constructing artificial layers and theoretical models of dendrite penetration in inorganic electrolytes110,111 (e.g., the density-driven stabilization mechanism) can be helpful for designing advanced MOF-based SSEs.
Summary
In this perspective, we have highlighted the significant progress and multiple strategies to achieve high ionic conductivity in MOF-related SSEs, which can be classified into three categories: MOF-incorporated CPEs, IL-laden MOFs, and MOFs as SSEs. Each category has its own merits and challenges, which are listed in Table 2 and Fig. 6. The MOF-incorporated CPEs demonstrate room-temperature ionic conductivities in the range of 10−6–10−3 S cm−1 with a moderate cation transference number (0.4–0.6), which are determined by the contact area and interactions among MOFs, salts, and polymer matrices. Their high flexibility generally contributes to a fine interfacial contact with the electrodes, while the relatively weak strength with low Young's modulus may cause the risk of dendrite penetration. The limited thermal stability and the low oxidation potential of MOF-incorporated CPEs further restrict their application in high-energy-density batteries. As for IL-laden MOF SSEs, the loading of nonflammable and nonvolatile ILs enables a good interfacial wettability with high safety for high-temperature batteries. The ionic conductivities (10−6 to 10−3 S cm−1) of IL-laden MOF SSEs are mainly determined by the loading amount of IL, the types of MOFs, and the inner interactions. The transference numbers of cations (0.3–0.4) are affected by the pore structure and surface property of MOFs. The rich variety and controllability of MOFs and ILs provide great opportunities for the design of high-performance SSEs. Among the neat MOF SSEs, the “single-ion” MOF SSEs stand out with growing attention due to their high cation transference numbers (>0.7) and suppressed polarization effect. Their ionic conductivities range from 10−7 to 10−3 S cm−1, and are determined by the Lewis-acidic sites or functional groups on the MOFs, as well as the residual solvents. The residual solvents could enhance the interfacial wetting ability and promote ion migration, but their flammability causes potential safety risks. Compared with MOF-incorporated CPEs, IL-laden MOFs and neat MOFs as SSEs possess much higher mechanical strength. The hardness might be helpful to suppress dendrite formation to some extent.

 Fig. 6  The challenges and future directions faced by the three types of MOF-based SSEs, together with the advantages of MOFs for SSEs. 
The utility of MOFs for high-performance SSEs is still an emerging research topic. The high surface area of MOFs enables the installation of high-density charged species within small pores to form closely packed cation hopping sites, which could minimize the activation energy for ion transport and thus enhance the ionic conductivity. Besides, the rich porosity and ordered channels of MOFs favor the uniform deposition of cations, preventing the dendrite formation. Moreover, the variability of surface polarity, metal species, and pore structure by post-synthetic modification, as well as judicious selection of the organic ligands and metal centers offer multiple possibilities for the systematic optimization of the electrochemical performance of MOF-related SSEs. Due to the molecular designability, MOFs also serve as ideal platforms for mechanism studies. Despite these various advantages offered by the compositional and structural tunability of MOFs, challenges still exist in producing MOF-related SSEs. The cost in synthesizing MOFs can be a concern. The use of expensive ligands or the tedious fabrication processes impede the mass production of MOFs and MOF-based SSEs. The recently developed synthetic methods, such as microwave and spray drying, may bring opportunities for the scalable synthesis of MOFs at a relatively low cost. Another concern for MOF-based SSEs is the stability of MOFs upon battery cycling. Both the thermal and electrochemical stabilities of MOFs should be taken into consideration. The operating temperature of MOF-based SSEs should not exceed the decomposition temperature of MOFs. Since most MOFs generally decompose at 300–500 °C, most MOF-based SSEs can meet the temperature criteria for batteries. As for the electrochemical stability, redox reactions between MOFs with electrodes might occur under certain voltage conditions. Therefore, MOFs that have chemically inner ligands and metal sites with unchangeable valence are somewhat preferable, which could potentially improve the battery performance of MOF-based SSEs.
In the pursuit of advanced SSEs, future research studies can be conducted according to the following aspects:
(1) Basically, the impacts of crystal size, orientation, and morphology of MOFs on ionic conductivity should be further investigated, which may pave the way for clarifying conducting mechanisms.
(2) The chemical components of SSEs should be further explored and extended. For MOF-incorporated CPEs, explorations on new polymer materials and integration of multiple polymers are worth exploring due to the combined merits from each component. For IL-laden MOF SSEs, most of the existing IL@MOFs have not been investigated as SSEs for cation conduction. New trials of IL@MOF for SSEs are appealing. Moreover, different kinds of metal salts, together with various ILs, could be incorporated into the system. For pure MOFs as host materials, impregnating multi-types of metal salts rather than a singular one can be advantageous, which may promote the ionic conductivity via a cooperatively conductive path.
(3) Various interactions exist in MOF-related SSEs, including interactions between MOFs and the polymer matrix, MOFs and ILs, and MOFs and metal salts, which play an important role in determining the ion mobility and conductive pathway. An effective strategy to tune these interactions is to modify the surface polarity and coordination mode of MOFs, especially those with coordinatively unsaturated OMSs. The strong interacting strength between the OMSs and ions not only affects the ionic conductivity, but also the transference numbers, which can be utilized for the synthesis of single-ion SSEs.
(4) The attempts to develop new methodologies for fabricating advance SSEs are expected to alleviate some of the present issues. For example, by adjusting the reaction parameters in the synthesis process, the crystal size of MOFs could be made larger and thus reduce the grain boundaries, which could alleviate the issue of dendrite formation along crystal boundaries. Previous studies on MOF–polymer hybrids may provide some enlightenment to address the challenges of particle agglomeration in MOF-incorporated CPEs, while research works on IL@MOFs offer opportunities to clarify the mechanisms for ionic conduction and thus direct material fabrication.
(5) Innovatively, the implementation of new nanotechnology (e.g., electrospinning) and the development of novel structures (e.g., sandwich structure) are attractive research directions for SSE manufacturing.
(6) Finally, Although MOFs can work as functionalized fillers or host materials for different SSE systems, the detailed ion transportation mechanisms, as well as the exact role of MOFs are still unclear. Further works may make use of the designability of MOFs to systematically investigate the structure–property–performance relationships. As a powerful tool, theoretical calculations, such as molecular dynamics simulations, may provide new opportunities to elucidate the complicated systems and give an in-depth understanding of the MOF-related SSEs to some degree.
