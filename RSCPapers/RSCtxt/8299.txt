    , Accepted 17th July 2020First published on 20th July 2020AbstractFlame-treatment as a simple, low cost, and highly reliable strategy was applied to effectively enhance the photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of liquid phase deposited Ti-doped hematite thin films. The samples were heat-treated in three steps: 2 hours at 600 °C, one minute at 800 °C, and then 90 seconds in the flame of a paraffin wax candle. The microstructure studies revealed that the granular – morphology of the films depends on Ti doping levels and varies from acicular-like for the undoped and 1% Ti doped to spherical-like for 2–4% Ti, and then to warm-like morphology for 5% Ti-doped samples. The optical band-gap energy values of the samples decreased from 1.94 eV for the undoped to 1.53 eV for the 4% Ti-doped sample. The PEC investigations showed that heat-treatment in the candle flame effectively enhanced the photocurrent density, with an about thirteen-fold increase compared to the non-flame-treated sample. The photocurrent density was also increased by the Ti-doping level up to 4% and then declined for the sample with a 5% Ti-doping level. The highest photocurrent density was obtained as about 1.01 mA cm−2 at 1.8 V vs. RHE, about 14 times higher than that of the pure sample. Mott–Schottky analysis indicated that the donor concentrations and flat-band potentials are 2.65 × 1017 cm−3 and 0.42 V vs. RHE for the undoped sample and 1.2 × 1018 cm−3 and 0.47 V vs. RHE for the sample with 4% Ti-doping. The obtained PEC properties were also confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Our investigations demonstrated that upon candle-flame treatment, oxygen vacancies are introduced into the lattice of hematite thin films, which activate Ti-doping and act as electron donors.
1. Introduction
Global warming due to carbon dioxide released from fossil fuel consumption has had adverse consequences for the environment.1 Conversion and storage of sustainable solar energy has been a matter of interest, mainly after the petroleum crisis in the 1970s. Hydrogen, as the cleanest fuel, produces water vapor with no carbon dioxide emissions upon burning.2 Water splitting and hydrogen generation by advanced techniques using renewable energy sources is hence essential for the generation of hydrogen with zero-emissions.3 In PEC cell-based electrolysis systems, a semiconductor photoanode is utilized which is capable of solar energy absorption and splitting water into its constituent elements, oxygen and hydrogen molecules.4 Among projected semiconductors for PEC applications, hematite is considered as a promising candidate because of its suitable band-gap energy within the visible range of sun-light, abundance in the earth's crust, non-toxicity, and chemical stability.5–7 However, it suffers from low hole diffusion depth, short charge carrier life-time, and low charge separation.8,9 Adding elements as dopants such as Sn,10 Si,11 Ag,12 Y,13 Zr,14 Ge,15 Mg,16 and Ti4,17–22 may modify several properties of hematite and improve its practical efficiency. In particular, addition of Ti and Sn has been the subject of several encouraging studies.23 A density-functional theory (DFT)24 study conducted on the band structures of pure and Ti-doped hematite has shown that incorporation of titanium's s and d orbitals modifies the conduction band in such a way as to decrease the effective mass of the electrons and increase the electron mobility. The negative lattice strain upon Ti-doping shortens the Fe–Fe inter-planar distance, which facilitates the polaron hopping of electrons. The improvements in the PEC properties upon Ti-doping have been mainly attributed to the increased charge carrier concentration,25,26 improvement of the charge transport in the semiconductor,27,28 passivation of grain boundaries,22 reduction of electron–hole recombination near the surface due to the improved water oxidation reaction,22,25 changes in the morphology,29 and an improvement in crystallinity.30
A number of reports have also focused on post-treatment processes for structural/morphological modification of hematite. Although the crystallization temperature of hematite is about 500 °C to 600 °C, different research groups have suggested that heat treatment temperatures of about 800 °C can noticeably increase the PEC efficiency.31–37 Gao et al.,38 for instance, have applied a rapid thermal annealing process to activate Ti dopants in hematite ultrathin films and enrich the PEC properties. By coating the three dimensional (3D) nanophotonic structures of hematite thin films,38 the light absorption and surface area were increased and the PEC properties enhanced, accordingly. Coating the hematite thin films using a cobalt phosphate co-catalyst38 can also improve the PEC properties by facilitating the collection of photo-generated holes. Another efficient way to improve the performance of hematite photoanodes is to control/introduce oxygen vacancies in hematite thin films. Oxygen vacancies act as electron donors and increase electrical conductivity.39 They can also activate the donor doping of metal oxides and enhance the light absorption properties.40 For example, Freitas et al.41 heat-treated hematite thin films in a N2 atmosphere and found superior PEC properties compared to those samples heat-treated in air and O2 atmospheres. Zhu et al.42 indicated that treating hematite thin films by using an air-plasma resulted in the formation of oxygen vacancies. Highly crystalline metal oxides containing oxygen vacancies can be synthesized by the flame-synthesis method,43 or flame-treatment44–46 can be employed to introduce oxygen vacancies into metal oxide thin films and nanostructures. Cho et al.45 utilized a propane/air flame as a reducing environment to produce oxygen vacancies to improve the PEC performance of TiO2 nanowires (NWs) by 3.0 times, Fe2O3 NWs by 9.4 times, ZnO NWs by 2.0 times and BiVO4 thin films by 4.3 times. The flame reduction process is simple and efficient, temperatures as high as 1000 °C are achieved with a rapid heating rate and it is applicable for different kinds of metal oxides without affecting the morphology and the crystallinity of the nanostructures.44–46 The same research group indicated that Ti-doping of Fe2O3 nanorods (NRs) by diffusion of the coated titanium precursor into Fe2O3 NRs by flame-treatment is more efficient than furnace heating. A drastically low onset potential of 0.92 V vs. RHE was achieved for the Ti-doped sample by flame-treatment.46 In another research study, Cho et al.44 took advantage of the high temperature (>1000 °C) and rapid heating rate of flame-treatment to dope TiO2 NWs with the rapid diffusion of the coated tungsten precursor into the TiO2 NWs. In the next step, they introduced carbon as the second dopant by heat-treating the NWs in carbon monoxide gas and the PEC properties were enhanced 2.4 times compared to the pristine TiO2 NWs. Different strategies and controllable parameters in the formation of hematite thin films would also influence/determine the obtainable structures, morphological features, and thus PEC properties.
Hematite thin films can be grown by different techniques including sol–gel,47–51 hydrothermal,33,52–56 spray pyrolysis,36,57–61 pulsed laser deposition,19,20,62–65 sputtering,66–69 flame synthesis,23,70 atomic layer deposition16,71–73 and electrodeposition.74–76 Liquid phase deposition (LPD) as a facile and cost-effective technique is applicable for the growth of highly uniform thin films of various metal oxides such as SiO2,79 TiO2,80 SnO2,81 WO3,82 MoO3,83 Nb2O584 and FePO4.85 The LPD technique has also been employed to grow hematite thin films by slow hydrolysis of [FeF6]3− species in an aqueous solution in the presence of boric acid at temperatures as low as 60 °C.86 In 1997, for the first time, a hematite thin film with high purity was synthesized by the LPD technique87 and, after modification of the synthesis, applied in supercapacitors, in 2017.86 LPD reactions based on the hydrolysis of [FeF6]3− species have also been studied and used to grow spinel ferrites and barium hexaferrite.88,89 Based on reaction (R1), hydrolysis of [FeF6]3− species reaches an equilibrium. This reaction proceeds toward hydrolysis in the presence of boric acid, which acts as a scavenger for fluoride ions. As a result, the concentration of fluoride ions on the right side of reaction (R1) decreases and hydrolysis reaction proceeds toward the production of iron hydroxide.85,86 FeF63− + 3H2O ⇆ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ + 6F−(R1) H3BO3 + 4F− ⇆ BF4− + 2H2O + H3O+(R2)
In this study, highly uniform Ti-doped hematite thin films were grown by the LPD technique on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates for PEC water splitting applications. An effective strategy, heat-treatment of hematite thin films in a reducing flame, was introduced to enhance the photocurrent density of the hematite thin films. The mechanism responsible for enhancing the photocurrent density was discussed. In addition, the effects of Ti-doping content on the microstructure, optical properties, and PEC properties of the hematite thin films were systematically studied.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals
The chemicals, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O obtained from Loba Chemie, 30 wt% NH4OH aqueous solution, boric acid with 99% purity, NH4F·HF with 98% purity, TiO2 with 98% purity and hydrofluoric acid with 37% purity obtained from Merck and deionized (DI) water with 0.1 μS cm−2 electrical conductivity were used.
2.2. Liquid phase deposition of thin films
0.1 mol of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was dissolved in 200 ml DI-water and 0.35 mol of NH4OH was added to obtain iron hydroxide precipitates. The precipitates were washed and left at room temperature for seven days to obtain FeOOH. 0.25 g of FeOOH was dissolved in 50 ml of 1 M NH4F·HF solution at room temperate for one hour to obtain a colorless [FeF6]3− complex solution.39 40 mmol of TiO2 was dissolved in 1.2 M HF solution at 70 °C for seven days to acquire a [TiF6]2− complex solution.
Before the LPD reactions, the fluorine-doped SnO2 coated glass (FTO-Sharif solar) substrates (1 cm × 1.5 cm) were washed with detergent and rinsed with DI water. 40 ml of 0.5 M boric acid solution, 10 ml of the solution of FeOOH in NH4F·HF solution, and deionized water were mixed to prepare the treatment solution for the LPD reaction. The resulting solution was completely transparent and colorless. In order to grow Ti-doped films, different amounts of [TiF6]2− complex solution were added to the treatment solution. To prevent the deposition of particles due to the gravitational force, FTO coated glass substrates were immersed horizontally upside down in the solution to prevent the solution bulks precipitation on the FTO substrates due to the gravity. Also, a part of the substrate was masked by scotched tape to prevent deposition and secure an ohmic contact area for the electrochemical experiments. The films were deposited at 60 °C for one hour followed by rinsing with DI-water and drying at room-temperature for 24 hours. In order to ensure complete crystallization of the film, the samples were first heat-treated at 600 °C for 2 hours and then at 800 °C for one minute in an air atmosphere. The samples were finally flame-treated by using a paraffin wax candle for 90 seconds. The surface of the films was covered by a layer of soot. This layer was removed by cotton wool sticks and then the films were sonicated for five minutes in DI-water to remove any remaining soot on the films.
2.3. Structural characterization
XRD analysis (Philips-X’pert-Pro-MPD with Co-Kα, λ = 1.78901 Å and by a 0.02° s−1 scanning rate from 15 to 75°) was used to identify the crystalline phases. Surface and cross-sectional microscopic images of the hematite thin films were collected by using a Mira3 Tescan field emission scanning electron microscope with 15 kV accelerating voltage and 5.1 mm working distance. Optical properties of the undoped and Ti-doped samples were determined by UV-Visible Spectroscopy using a SPUV-26 spectrometer within the 340–1000 nm wavelength range. Magnetization versus magnetic field of the samples were measured at room temperature by using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) (Meghnatis Daghigh Kavir).
2.4. PEC analysis
The PEC properties of the samples were studied via a potentiostat (PGS-8 Sharif Solar) with a three-electrode configuration, using a platinum plate as a counter electrode, the Ag–AgCl electrode as the reference, and the films as the working electrodes. To measure the PEC properties of the films, the electrodes were fixed in a PEC cell containing a 1 M KOH solution. An LED lamp with 70 W power was used as the light source to measure the photocurrent with an AM 1.5 G filter. The basic potential in these measurements is based on the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed under dark conditions using an Ivium potentiostat with a similar three-electrode system and electrolyte used for the PEC studies (0.5 Hz–6 kHz frequency range at 1.23 V vs. RHE).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural studies

Fig. 1a presents the XRD patterns of the liquid phase deposited thin films with different Ti-doping levels. All the diffracted peaks belong to FTO except for the peaks at ∼39.4° and ∼41.6° (2θ values) which are matched with the (104) and (110) planes of the crystalline hematites. The intensity of the (110) peak depends on the Ti-doping levels; while it disappears for the samples with 3% and 4% Ti-doping, it clearly exists for the sample with 5% Ti-doping. These changes are likely related to the particular microstructures of the films with respect to Ti doping levels, further discussed in the Microstructure studies section.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of (a) the thin films and (b) the collected powders with different amounts of Ti-doping, and (c) a close view of the (104) diffraction peaks for the powders. 
The powders were collected from the bulk precipitate of the LPD solution and heat-treated at 750 °C for 6 hours. The obtained powders were characterized by XRD analysis and their patterns are shown in Fig. 1b. All the diffracted peaks are indexed to hematite with a trigonal crystal system and R3c space group.32,90,91 The most intense diffraction peak, (104), of the powders is highlighted and shown in Fig. 1c. Visibly, an increase in the amount of Ti-doping resulted in a peak shift toward higher 2θ values. These shifts can probably be attributed to the formation of Fe2O3–xTiO2 solid solution. Since Fe3+ ions of ∼0.065 nm were substituted by Ti4+ ions of ∼0.061 nm in their average radius,92 it resulted in an increase in the lattice parameters causing a peak shift to higher 2θ values.22
3.2. Microstructure studies

Fig. 2a–f show FE-SEM top-view images of the films with different Ti-doping amounts and the inset images correspond to the microstructure of the flame-treated samples. FE-SEM images suggest that the microstructure of the flame-treated samples is more porous than for the pristine samples. Such a porous microstructure can act in favor of the PEC properties since the electrolyte becomes in more contact with the photoanode surface. Similar results were obtained by Park et al.93 in studying flame-annealed copper ferrite photoanode samples. They found that flame-annealed samples are more porous than their counterparts annealed in an electrical furnace. Evidently, the microstructure of the films varies from acicular-like grains for the samples with 0 and 1% Ti-doping to spherical grains for the samples with 2–4% doping amounts, and then to warm-like structures for the 5% Ti-doped samples (Fig. 2a–f). It was shown in several studies that Ti-doping levels would impact the morphological features of hematite thin films obtained using different synthesis methods such as dip coating,94 atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition95 and electrospinning.96 Microstructural investigations suggest that when the grains grow along the c-axis in the plane, (110) facets are more exposed to the X-rays. The (110) peak intensity is thus intensified for the 0, 1, and 5% Ti-doped samples. For the samples with 0 and 1% Ti-doping levels, the lateral size of the acicular features are estimated as ∼35 ± 10 nm and ∼84 ± 20 nm with longitudinal sizes of ∼335 ± 50 nm and ∼334 ± 66 nm, respectively. The size of the spherical grains is also measured: ∼133 ± 23 nm, 129 ± 43 nm, and ∼151 ± 40 nm for the 2, 3, and 4% Ti-doped samples, respectively. The warm-like grains are ∼100 ± 15 nm in their lateral size and ∼252 ± 66 nm in their longitudinal size. In addition, all the films consist of cracks which are likely originated and developed during the drying and/or crystallization processes. The presence of cracks in the films may increase the active surfaces and keep the electrolyte more in contact with the surface of the grains, enriching the water splitting properties.96Fig. 2g shows a cross-sectional view of the films with ∼50 nm thickness uniformly covering the substrate. Our observation and analysis also revealed that the synthesized thin films with diverse doping amounts have excellent adhesion and scratch resistance characteristics. Fig. S1a–d (ESI†) shows FE-SEM cross-sectional views of 4% Ti-doped samples with different thicknesses in both secondary and back-scattered modes. The thickness of the films varied within the 50–900 nm thickness range by deposition time. By using the LPD method, it is convenient to control the film thickness simply by varying the deposition time. Variation of film thickness versus deposition time is shown in Fig. S1f (ESI†). LPD enables us to control the film thickness from ∼50 nm to ∼480 nm.

3.3. Optical properties
The optical properties of the samples were studied by UV-Visible spectroscopy. Fig. 3a and b represent absorbance spectra and the corresponding Tauc plots of the samples, respectively. The absorption edge of the films shifts from 598 to 676 nm when the Ti-doping level changes from 0 to 4% (Fig. 3a). The absorption peak at about 420 nm is related to ligand field transitions 6A1/4E1, 4A1 (4G) of Fe3+.96
 Fig. 3  (a) UV-Vis absorbance spectra of the Ti-doped hematite thin films. (b) Corresponding Tauc plots of the samples and (c) Tauc plots of pristine and flame-treated 4% Ti-doped sample. 
The band-gap energy values of the samples are obtainable using eqn (1): αhν = A(hν − Eg)n(1)where hν represents the photon energy (eV), α is the absorption coefficient (cm−1), Eg stands for the material's band-gap energy (eV), and A0 is a constant. n is 2 for indirect and 0.5 for direct transitions.18
Considering direct transitions94 in the band structures of hematite thin films, the band-gap energy values were obtained (Fig. 3b). These data show that Ti-doping levels up to 4% would modify the band structure since the band-gap energy values decreased from ∼1.94 eV to ∼1.53 eV. The measured value for the 5% Ti-doped sample is ∼1.75 eV, declining the aforementioned trend (Fig. 3b). Investigated by Liu et al.,97 the addition of Ti to hematite creates an energy level in the band structure, more positive than the bonding energy of the conduction band. This may result in the reduction of the band gap values. Similarly, Kumari et al.98 observed that as the Ti percentage increased, the band gap decreased markedly. Though the interpretation of the data is subjective and not always definite, the semiconductor band-gap energy should be large enough to suppress the electron–hole recombination process in water splitting and over-potential for redox reactions. Beside, Chae et al. suggested that 1.5 to 2.5 eV is an appropriate range for water splitting.96Fig. 3c presents the Tauc plots of 4% Ti-doped pristine and flame-treated samples. The Tauc plot indicates that the band gap energy values for the pristine and flame-treated samples are 1.68 eV and 1.64 eV, respectively. Upon Ti-doping, impurity levels are created below the conduction band of hematite resulting in a decrease in the band gap energy value. The small difference (0.04 eV) of the measured band gap energy values is attributed to strain induced by the flame-treatment process.
3.4. PEC properties
The effects of flame-treatment on the PEC properties of the undoped and 4% Ti-doped samples were investigated. Fig. 4a and b represent the J–V and chronoamperometry plots of the samples. The obtained data reveal that the flame-treated samples exhibit superior PEC properties compared to non-flame-treated samples. The photocurrent density for the flame-treated undoped, and 4% Ti-doped samples was enhanced by six-fold and thirteen-fold compared to their non-flame-treated counterparts, respectively. The electrochemical impedance spectra of the heat-treated samples are shown in Fig. 4c. The RS represents the electrolyte resistance in the circuit, R1 represents the resistance of the interface between FTO and hematite, and R2 represents the charge transfer resistance in the interface between the semiconductor and electrolyte. The fitted resistance values based on the equivalent circuit are tabulated in Table 1. These data indicate that the flame-treatment process considerably facilitated the charge transport and it clearly enhanced the PEC properties.

When a candle burns in a steady-state, its flame is divided into four zones. The first zone located at the bottom of the flame which is in blue is known as the blue zone. The temperature of this zone is ∼600 °C. Chemiluminescence of excited CH+ radicals is responsible for the blue color. The second region is called the dark-zone. The temperature of this zone is within the 800–1000 °C temperature range. In this zone, the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons into smaller ones occurs. The third region is the luminous zone or incandescent zone. In this zone, cracking of hydrocarbons continues and small carbon particles are produced as a result of the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. The small carbon particles are heated and glow a bright yellow. The temperature of this zone varies within the 1000–1200 °C temperature range. The non-luminous zone is the fourth zone where the complete burning of elemental carbon and hydrocarbons occurs and the temperature of this zone is as high as 1400 °C.99,100
The samples were flame-treated within the third zone, the temperature of which varies within the 1000–1200 °C temperature range. The surface of the films was covered with a layer of soot. At such a high temperature, carbon from soot can react with oxygen ions of hematite to produce oxygen vacancies according to the following defect chemistry reaction by using Kröger–Vink notation: (R3)
Note that such a high temperature ensures the formation of CO, not CO2 according to Boudouard reaction.100 To keep the charge neutrality of the hematite films upon the introduction of oxygen vacancies, donor electrons are released into the lattice.
In the absence of oxygen vacancies, it is well-known that Ti-doping of hematite leads to the formation of iron vacancies based on the following defect chemistry reaction:101 (R4)
The introduction of oxygen vacancies based on Brower diagrams101 activates the Ti-donor doping based on the following defect chemistry reaction: (R5)
In the presence of carbon, reaction (R3) can be re-written as the following reaction which is the sum of reaction (R3) and the C + O2(g) → 2CO(g) reaction: (R6)
Based on reaction (R6), candle flame-treatment activated the Ti-doping by producing oxygen vacancies and as a result, electrons are released into the lattice of hematite.
To confirm the formation of oxygen vacancies, Mott–Schottky measurements (Fig. 5a) were performed on a 4% Ti-doped sample before and after the flame-treatment under dark conditions at 1 kHz operating frequency. From the slope of the linear part of 1/C2versus applied potential, it is clear that the electron donor density of the flame-treated sample is higher than that for the pristine sample. The electron donor density values for the pristine and flame-treated sample were extracted as ∼5.7 × 1017 cm−3 and 1.2 × 1018 cm−3, respectively. The flat band potential for the flame-treated sample (∼0.65 V vs. RHE) is higher than that for the pristine sample (∼0.39 V vs. RHE).

The samples were alternately flame-treated by candle and methane flames in two cycles. Unlike the candle flame, the methane flame acts as an oxidizing agent. Fig. 5b and c show chronoamperometry data and photocurrent density for the successive flame-treatment process by the candle and methane flames, respectively. The decrease in the photocurrent density upon methane flame-treatment is an indication of the consumption of oxygen vacancies since the methane flame acts as an oxidizing agent, unlike the candle-flame.
Flame-treatment would most likely alter the charge compensation mechanism, from the formation of iron vacancies to the release of electrons. As a result, the concentration of the charge carriers increases and upon optical excitations, more charge carriers can participate in electrical transport.102,103 Li et al.104 have reported a fire-treatment of hematite thin films using butanol and shown improved PEC properties, likely due to the removal of surface hydroxyls, acting as surface trap states, and also due to the surface reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+. Notably, the drastic enhancement of photocurrent density presented here for the flame-treated samples (Fig. 4a and b) is highly reproducible. Besides, our preliminary experiments showed that a similar flame-treatment method can also be applied for the simple and cost-effective modification of other n-type or donor-doped metal oxides.
Hematite is a canted antiferromagnetic oxide at room temperature.105 Upon the formation of each oxygen vacancy, two Fe3+ cations with 5 μB convert to Fe2+ with 4 μB. The magnetization curves of a sample before and after the flame-treatment were measured by a vibration sample magnetometer (VSM) as shown in Fig. 5d. It was found that the flame-treated sample has higher susceptibility than the pristine sample. The increase in the susceptibility upon flame-treatment is attributed to the existence of Fe2+ in an antiferromagnetic coupling system which increases the magnetic susceptibility.105
To demonstrate further the formation of oxygen vacancies, the flame-treated sample was oxidized at 600 °C in an air atmosphere for two hours. It is well-known that Fe2+ cations oxidize above 400 °C to Fe3+ in air.106J–V and chronoamperometry plots of the flame-treated sample before and after the air oxidation process are shown in Fig. 6a and b, respectively. As expected, the current density for the sample oxidized in the air was decreased. Such a decrease corresponds to the consumption of oxygen vacancies which results in a decrease in current density.
 Fig. 6  (a) J–V and (b) chronoamperometry plots of flame-treated samples before and after the air oxidation process (the dashed curves in the J–V plot correspond to dark current density). 
The thickness-dependent PEC properties of 4% Ti-doped samples were measured under dark and illumination conditions and their J–V and chronoamperometry plots are shown in Fig. S2a and b (ESI†), respectively. The thinnest film (∼50 nm) showed the highest photocurrent density while the thickest one (∼480 nm) showed the lowest photocurrent density.

Fig. 7a and b show the J–V curves of the films from 0.8 to 1.8 V vs. RHE and the chronoamperometry data at 1.8 V vs. RHE potential with chopped light, respectively. These data indicate that the level of the photocurrent densities was enhanced by Ti-doping. The photocurrent density for pure hematite films was measured as ∼0.1 mA cm−2. Upon Ti-doping, the level of photocurrent density was significantly intensified. The highest photocurrent value of ∼1.1 mA cm−2 (at 1.8 V vs. RHE) was measured for the 4% Ti-doped films, 14 times higher than that of the undoped sample (Fig. 7a). However, the photocurrent density decreased to 0.86 mA cm−2 (at 1.8 V vs. RHE) for 5% Ti-doped films, consistent with microstructural observation and optical properties. As previously discussed, the 4% Ti-doped sample characterized with a fine microstructure and the lowest band-gap energy value exhibited enhanced PEC properties. Also, the onset potential (Fig. 7a) decreased about 900 mV on Ti-doping compared to the undoped sample. Such a drastic decrease in the onset potential is more than the value reported by Kalamaras et al.77 The cathodic shift of the onset potential for the Ti-doped samples compared to the undoped sample is due to the fact that charge transport in Ti-doped samples is more efficient and their charge carrier concentration is higher.25 Also, the formation of oxygen vacancies at the surface can facilitate surface electrocatalytic processes and further decreases the onset potential.107 The highest photocurrent density of the electrodes in this study is less than,108 more than,97 and comparable to78,80 the reported values. Different optimal values for Ti doping levels, such as 1%17 and 0.25%,19 have previously been reported.96,98 Our optimum amount of Ti-doping is, however, similar to the work presented by Hahn and co-workers.109 To further investigate the effects of Ti-doping on the PEC properties, we also measured the flat-band potential and donor concentration of the samples with 0 and 4% Ti-doping using Mott–Schottky analysis. The space charge layer capacitance (C) relates to the applied potential by the following equation: (2)where εo and εr represent the vacuum permittivity and dielectric constant of semiconductors respectively (εr is 80 for hematite96). While e is the elementary charge, ND stands for donor concentration. Flat band potential is shown using Vfb. kB is the Boltzmann constant and T absolute temperature.110Fig. 5c shows the Mott–Schottky plots of the samples with 0 and 4% Ti. The positive slope of the graphs indicates that the films are n-type semiconductors108,111,112 and the extrapolation of the linear part of the graphs to the applied potential axis corresponds to the flat-band potential. The flat band potential was measured as ∼0.46 and ∼0.63 V vs. RHE for the 0 and 4% Ti-doped samples, respectively. These values are similar to the reported flat band potential values reported by Nathan et al.109 It was expected that upon Ti-doping, a negative shift occurs in the flat-band potential.12,17,22,98 However, in this study, the flat-band potential was increased by Ti-doping as reported by other studies.18,96,112,113 The reason for the anodic shift in the flat-band potential upon Ti-doping could be assigned to the increased charge carrier density and shift of the band edge positions to higher energies with respect to RHE. This anodic shift could also be attributed to the surface states created by Ti-doping and oxygen vacancies near to the surface of the hematite electrode.114,115 The donor concentration of the samples was extracted from the slope of the graphs: ∼2.65 × 1017 and ∼1.20 × 1018 cm−3 for the undoped and doped samples, respectively. The donor density of the Ti-doped sample is one order of magnitude higher than that of the undoped sample, direct evidence for improved performance and PEC properties of the Ti-doped sample.98,112 The charge carrier transportation was also analyzed by using the EIS technique. EIS experiments were performed at 1.23 V vs. RHE under dark conditions to understand the charge transfer of the samples with 0 and 4% Ti-doping. The Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 7d consist of two separate arcs. The first one present at high frequencies relates to the semiconductor itself and the second one at low frequencies corresponds to the semiconductor–electrolyte interface. The fitted values are shown in Table 2. It can be seen that R1 decreased from 4639.0 Ω for the undoped sample to 530.8 Ω for the 4% Ti-doped. R2 also decreased from ∼360.0 kΩ for the undoped sample to ∼26.2 kΩ for the 4% Ti-doped sample. These data display that the charge transfer for the Ti-doped sample is much faster than that of the undoped sample. The improvement of charge transfer and the reduction of the surface oxidation kinetics perceived in the Ti-doped samples are an essential consideration for water splitting applications.96

4. Conclusions
In summary, candle flame-treatment as a simple, cost-effective and highly reliable strategy was introduced to significantly improve the PEC properties of the Ti-doped hematite thin films grown using the LPD method. It was found that upon flame-treatment, oxygen vacancies are introduced into the lattice of hematite thin films, which activate the Ti-doping and act as electron donors. The microstructure of the films is dependent on the Ti-doping level and it varies from acicular-like to spherical-like and then to warm-like by Ti-doping. Among the flame-treated samples with different Ti-doping levels, the sample with 4% Ti-doping showed the lowest band-gap value energy (∼1.53 eV) and the highest photocurrent density (∼1.01 mA cm−2) which is ∼14 times more than that for the undoped sample. The Mott–Schottky and EIS analyses showed that the 4% Ti-doped sample possesses a higher charge carrier density and a stronger electric field in the depletion layer than the undoped hematite sample.
