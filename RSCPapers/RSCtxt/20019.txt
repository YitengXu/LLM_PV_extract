    , Accepted 24th October 2022First published on 31st October 2022AbstractThe complex, [{[Mn(bpy)(CO)3]2}(μ-CN)]+ (Mn2CN+), has previously been shown to photochemically reduce CO2 to CO. The detailed mechanism behind its reactivity was not elucidated. Herein, the photoevolution of this reaction is studied in acetonitrile (MeCN) using IR and UV-vis spectroscopy. Samples were excited into the MnI → π* bpy metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) absorption band triggering CO loss, and rapid MeCN solvent ligation at the open coordination site. It is concluded that this process occurs selectively at the Mn axial ligation site that is trans to the C-end of the bridging cyanide. Upon further photolysis, the metal–metal bonded dimeric species, [(CO)3(bpy)Mn–Mn(bpy)(CO)3] (Mn–Mn) is observed to form under anaerobic conditions. The presence of this dimeric species coincides with the observation of CO production. When oxygen is present, CO2 photoreduction does not occur, which is attributed to the inability of Mn2CN+ to convert to the metal–metal bonded dimer. Photolysis experiments, where the Mn–Mn dimer is formed photochemically under argon first and then exposed to CO2, reveal that it is the radical species, [Mn(bpy)(CO)3˙] (Mn˙), that interacts with the CO2. Since the presence of Mn–Mn and light is required for CO production, [Mn(bpy)(CO)3˙] is proposed to be a photochemical reagent for the transformation of CO2 to CO.
Introduction
Finding ways to harness solar energy to form chemical bonds via CO2 reduction is desirable because they provide a promising way to recycle carbon sources by creating organic feedstocks and fuels.1,2 To this end, complexes containing the rhenium polypyridine motif have demonstrated versatility as catalysts in electro- and photocatalytic CO2 reduction.3–7 There is an interest in the use of [MnI(diimine)(CO)3(X)] as molecular catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, owing to the higher natural abundance and availability of Mn as compared to Re.2,8 In contrast to significant progress using Mn complexes for electrochemical CO2 reduction, relatively less attention has been given to photochemical CO2 reduction.9,10 Certainly, this photochemical activation involves multiple electron transfer processes that may couple with protons to generate critical intermediates.11 Therefore, thorough investigation and mechanistic insights are important in order to develop this photochemical system.
The photochemistry and photophysics of first- and third-row transition carbonyl complexes are quite different due to the important role of spin–orbital coupling in the heavy transition metals. [Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl] and related complexes, for example, emit in room temperature solution upon excitation of the MLCT states, while the manganese analog does not.6,12 The photostability of the Re complexes under excitation of the low-lying MLCT state plays a vital role in accounting for their photocatalytic versatility.13 In contrast, the Mn diimine tricarbonyl complexes are photolabile and undergo photochemical reaction strikingly different from those of Re complexes.14 In the Mn complexes, excitation of the MLCT state leads to dissociation of an axial ligand as the reactive ligand field state becomes thermally populated, due to the internal conversion from the low-lying MLCT state.14
[Mn(bpy)(CO)3Br] has been of interest as an electrocatalyst for the reduction of CO2 to CO since 2011.15 However, the deleterious photochemical instability of this complex in solution under normal room light, as noted by a number of research groups, has made study of this electrochemistry challenging.14,16–21 We now report that the observed apparent chemical instability in this class of complexes is also due to the extreme oxygen sensitivity of the photochemical intermediates. Further, we associate this oxygen sensitivity with the inability of the starting material to photochemically form [(CO)3(bpy)Mn–Mn(bpy)(CO)3] (Mn–Mn), and the associated radical species, [Mn(bpy)(CO)3˙]. In coming to this conclusion, we suggest that Mn˙ is the primary species associated with the photochemical conversion of CO2 to CO.
The results and conclusions presented here are based on photochemical studies of [(CO)3(bpy)MnI–CN–MnI(bpy)(CO)3]+, formed by reacting [Mn(bpy)(CO)3Br] with [Mn(bpy)(CO)3CN] in the presence of silver perchlorate (Fig. 1).22

Here, we describe a mechanistic scheme based on photophysical and spectroscopic evidence for the reactivity of Mn2CN+, leading to the two-electron reduction of CO2 to CO, along with an understanding of the unanticipated role of trace O2 in this chemistry. Though based on the specific starting material Mn2CN+, we suggest that the reaction scheme developed here is broadly applicable to the chemistry of this class of manganese carbonyl complexes.
Results & discussion
Owing to the different binding properties of the two ends of the cyanide bridging ligand in Mn2CN+ (i.e. pure σ-donor on the N-terminal versus π-acceptor on the C-end), we anticipated inequivalent metal–ligand bond strengths for the two CO ligands trans to the bridging cyanide ligand. This hypothesis was experimentally substantiated by the bond length difference observed between the two axial Mn–CO bonds in the crystal structure of Mn2CN+, and the two carbon signals associated with the axial carbonyl groups in the 13C NMR of this complex, as reported previously and reviewed in Table 1.22

Based on these observations, we hypothesize that upon MLCT excitation in acetonitrile, dissociation of the axial CO trans to the C-end of the cyanide bridge occurs. Acetonitrile is then expected to ligate to this coordination site forming the intermediate (s-Mn2CN+) shown in Fig. 2. This specific species is hypothesized over ligand loss trans to the N-terminus (Mn2CN+-s) based upon the IR spectrum before and after irradiation into the MLCT band.22

Dissociation of a CO ligand triggered by MLCT excitation has been established in α-diimine substituted monomeric Mn complexes.14,23–25 The photochemistry of fac-[Mn(bpy)(CO)3X] (X = halide) has been investigated by Stor and co-workers.14,21,26,27 We observe a CO dissociation process in Mn2CN+ upon MLCT excitation.22
To understand the nature of the photo-induced intermediate, s-Mn2CN+, and the dynamics of the observed photochemistry, the photo-evolution of the intermediate was monitored via in situ IR spectroscopy during excitation of the MLCT transition using 395 nm light. Results of the IR photolysis are presented in Fig. 3 and the following observations are made: first, the higher frequency mode of the two axial CO stretches near 2050 cm−1 in Mn2CN+ are absent post radiation. Second, an additional CO stretching mode appears near 1870 cm−1. Last, the bridging-CN mode at ∼2150 cm−1 decreases, while a new bridging cyanide peak grows in around 2120 cm−1.

Although we have hypothesized the formation of s-Mn2CN+ as a photochemical intermediate, it is also conceivable that there is loss of the axial CO trans to the N-terminus of the cyanide bridge to form an Mn2CN+-s intermediate rather than s-Mn2CN+. To explore this possibility and verify the identity of the intermediate, we performed vibrational analysis of the pristine Mn2CN+ and the proposed MeCN-ligated intermediates (Mn2CN+-s and s-Mn2CN+). In Fig. 4, computed vibrational spectra are compared with the IR spectrum obtained after 60 s of irradiation at 395 nm (Fig. 3). After this reaction time, the MeCN-substituted intermediate is expected to be the majority species present. The simulated vibrational result based on the optimized geometry of s-Mn2CN+ predicts two additional vibrational modes at 1870 cm−1 and 2125 cm−1, which are attributed to carbonyls trans to bpy and bridged-CN stretching modes, respectively. These calculations predict that the main difference in vibrational spectra between Mn2CN+-s and s-Mn2CN+ are the CO stretching modes between 1850–1900 cm−1. Specifically, Mn2CN+-s is expected to have a vibrational band near 1900 cm−1. This predicted spectroscopic feature is significantly displaced compared to those observed in the experimental IR photolysis. On the other hand, the simulated vibrational line spectra of s-Mn2CN+ nicely accounts for the changes observed in the IR spectra. We emphasize that the vibrational feature at 1880 cm−1 observed in the IR photolysis experiment is characteristic and exclusive to s-Mn2CN+. Hence, we rule out formation of Mn2CN+-s. To rule out other likely possibilities for this intermediate, we compared the IR spectrum to those of [Mn(bpy)(CO)3CN] and [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)](PF6) in Fig. S1.†

To further study the initial photophysics of Mn2CN+, transient absorption (TA) experiments were carried out in MeCN solvent (Fig. 5). Spectral evolution of a stirred solution of Mn2CN+ in degassed MeCN is displayed in Fig. 5(a) and shows a broad photoinduced absorption (PIA) spanning from ∼425 nm to 650 nm. This PIA appears immediately upon photoexcitation when the sample is stirred within the cuvette during the experiment. Over ∼7 ns, the timespan of the experiment, there is little to no decay of this PIA.
 Fig. 5  Transient absorption spectra of Mn2CN+ obtained (a) with stirring and (b) without stirring over the picosecond time regime (∼0.74 to ∼5500 ps) in degassed MeCN. Both samples were excited with a 365 nm pump. 
However, when an air-free sample is not stirred during the experiment, several new negative signals arise, located at 460, 550, and 630 nm, as shown in Fig. 5(b). In the post-TA steady-state UV-vis spectrum, new peaks also arise at 461 and 633 nm. Stirring leads to the optically probed area of the sample being constantly replenished with complex that have not previously absorbed a photon. On the other hand, diffusional motion dominates when the sample is not stirred, allowing a greater amount of previously excited complex to remain in the probed sample volume, thereby allowing for the excitation of the primary photochemical products.
Following this logic, we hypothesize that two ground state products result from the decay of the Mn2CN+ excited state: one immediately upon deactivation (which is the predominant species observed in the stirred experiment) and another through a bimolecular encounter process. When the sample is stirred, only the immediately formed species is observed due to continuous replenishment of the probed sample volume. Lack of agitation allows enough diffusively reacting species to accumulate in the probed region that the bimolecular product forms and appears in the TA spectrum. The bimolecular photoproduct peaks are located very near to the previously reported Mn–Mn dimer characteristic absorptions and, as such, are assigned to ground state bleaches (GSBs) of the Mn–Mn dimer.14
Additionally, when the TA experiment was performed in MeCN that was not rigorously air-free, the single, broad PIA signal persisted. The bimolecular photoproduct, the Mn–Mn dimer, was observed to be extremely air-sensitive and further, its formation is inhibited in the presence of O2. However, the immediate photoproduct that is formed upon CO dissociation, s-Mn2CN+, is stable in the presence of O2. Upon comparison of the UV-vis spectra measured before and after TA experiments, with and without oxygen, we conclude that the persistent, broad PIA present in both degassed and non-degassed samples is s-Mn2CN+.
In air, the UV-vis of the Mn2CN+ complex after irradiation at 395 nm develops a peak around 500 nm with an isosbestic point at 420 nm as shown in Fig. 6 (bottom). This is indicative of a 1:1 conversion to the photoproduct s-Mn2CN+ as observed in the IR during the early time points (Fig. 3). However, in rigorously degassed MeCN, Mn2CN+ is converted rapidly to Mn–Mn, indicated by the peaks at 394, 461, 633, and 806 nm in Fig. 6 (top).15 Upon exposure of an oxygen-free irradiated sample to oxygen, the peaks correlating to the dimer disappear, and the spectrum resembles that of Mn2CN+ under irradiation in aerobic MeCN. Specifically, a shoulder around 520 nm appears, indicative of s-Mn2CN+.22 These experiments show that the Mn–Mn dimer will not form when oxygen is present, and if Mn–Mn is first formed under argon, will rapidly become oxidized upon exposure to oxygen.

An earlier report from our lab focused only on the initial photophysics of Mn2CN+ identifying the photoinduced loss of a CO ligand, and as such, did not report the formation of Mn–Mn.22 To study the initial photophysics of Mn2CN+, we had previously used a light source eleven orders of magnitude less intense than the light source used in this current work.28 We now report that beyond the initial formation of s-Mn2CN+ observed by IR spectroscopy in the first minute of irradiation (Fig. 3), characteristic Mn–Mn dimer peaks arise at 1976, 1961, 1935, 1882, and 1856 cm−1 in the IR (Fig. 7).14,19 These Mn–Mn dimer peaks only appear when the system is fully deoxygenated. The formation of Mn–Mn from s-Mn2CN+ necessitates that the cyanide bridge breaks to initially yield the two MnI species shown in Fig. 8.

The peak at 2090 cm−1 in the IR in Fig. 7 is characteristic of a terminal cyanide peak and we attribute this to the [MnI(bpy)(CO)2(CN)(MeCN)] species. Terminal cyanide peaks tend to be located at lower wavenumbers than bridging cyanide peaks, and thus can be differentiated from each other.22 The variation in ligand spheres about the two primary products will produce different Mn0/MnI redox potentials for each. We hypothesize that disproportionation between these two Mn(I) species forms [Mn(bpy)(CO)3˙] and [MnIIbpy(CO)3(MeCN)]+. Coupling two [Mn(bpy)(CO)3˙] fragments so formed is proposed to produce the Mn–Mn dimer along with [MnII(bpy)(CO)2(CN)(MeCN)]+ as outlined in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Proposed reaction scheme for the formation of Mn–Mn from Mn2CN+. 
To test this hypothesis, the EPR spectrum of 1 mM Mn2CN+ in degassed MeCN was measured at 10 K before and after irradiation (395 nm) at room temperature. While the initial sample does not yield an EPR signal, one is observed after irradiation (Fig. 9). The spectrum features a broad signal centered at giso = 1.995 without hyperfine splitting. This signal is assigned to a low spin, d5 MnII species based on literature reports for similar monomeric MnII complexes and the strong field nature of the carbonyl ligands.29–32 Thus, the anticipated MnII product is observed.

As depicted in Scheme 1, the proposed reaction mechanism, involves two, one-photon processes to form Mn–Mn from Mn2CN+. Since, the [MnI(bpy)(CO)2(CN)(MeCN)] intermediate acts as the electron donor and two of these are needed for every Mn–Mn dimer formed, this species is thought to be the limiting reagent in this reaction.
As previously reported, a requirement for CO2 photoreduction using this class of Mn tricarbonyl complexes is the presence of a proton source, which is thought to stabilize the M–CO2 adduct and facilitate cleavage of a C–O bond.15,16 Photolysis studies were performed with concurrent UV-vis spectroscopy using 0.1 mM Mn2CN+ in CO2-saturated 5% v/v H2O:MeCN. The time evolved UV-vis spectra measured over the course of the ten-minute photolysis experiment show Mn–Mn formation (Fig. 10).
 Fig. 10  UV-vis spectra of 0.1 mM Mn2CN+ in CO2-saturated MeCN taken every 30 s during 395 nm irradiation (2.97 × 10−9 einstein per s intensity), and showing an increase in dimer concentration from 0–120 s (top) and decrease in dimer formation (bottom) from 120–600 s. 
The corresponding concentration of Mn–Mn and the total amount of CO produced over the course of this photolysis experiment is shown in Fig. 11. The concentration of Mn–Mn was determined using the reported extinction coefficient of 11500 M−1 cm−1 at 805 nm.33 After 120 s, the concentration of Mn–Mn reaches a maximum, corresponding to 21.2 micromolar Mn–Mn. The presence of Mn–Mn in solution corresponds with the production of CO, as shown in Fig. 11a.

To verify that Mn2CN+ is capable of converting CO2 to CO, 13CO2 was employed in a control experiment using 1 M phenol as the proton source. It was found that 13CO2 is not converted to 13CO in the presence of oxygen. That is, in this case, the observed CO is 12CO, which is derived from extensive ligand dissociation. It is only when the MeCN solvent is thoroughly degassed using the freeze–pump–thaw method that a 13CO product is observed via gas phase IR (Fig. S2†), confirming the photochemical conversion of CO2 to CO. A 3 mL sample of 1 mM Mn2CN+ in 13CO2-saturated MeCN, using 1 M phenol as the proton source, was irradiated for 30 min at 395 nm. The total quantum yield for CO was 0.64 with 5.0 micromoles of CO detected in the headspace. Using the ratio of 13CO/12CO found in the corresponding gas phase IR spectrum, the corrected quantum yield for the photoreduction of CO2 to CO is 0.04. It is important to note that prior photochemical studies of manganese carbonyl complexes did not differentiate between dissociated CO and the CO produced from CO2 reduction, when reporting quantum yields.22,33 This has produced an improper picture of the efficiency at which the complexes of interest convert CO2 to CO.
The role of the Mn–Mn dimer in electrochemical CO2 reduction has been debated previously by various authors, including Ishitani,34 Deronzier,15,29 and Kubiak.16 Kubiak hypothesized that the Mn–Mn bond would cleave homolytically first, as this behavior has been seen for similar Mn–Mn species,35–37 before gaining another electron from an electron donor. Deronzier and coworkers note that the related [Mn0(dmbpy)(CO)3]2 dimer29 is capable of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. After generating [Mn0(dmbpy)(CO)3]2 dimer electrochemically, it was reported that exposure to CO2 led to an EPR signal correlated with a MnII-C(O)OH species. It was theorized to have formed after CO2 and H+ directly interacted via oxidative addition with [Mn0(dmbpy)(CO)3]2.29
To further explore the chemistry of Mn–Mn, the dimer was directly synthesized by one of three methods, shown in Scheme 2. By using method A, the entire experiment can be kept in the dark, from synthesis to reaction with CO2, allowing the evaluation of this complex with CO2 under purely thermal conditions. In contrast, methods B and C provide two ways in which CO2 can be introduced to the reaction vessel before Mn–Mn is formed.
 Scheme 2  Three methods for forming Mn–Mn. 
The formation of Mn–Mn upon irradiation of [Mn(bpy)(CO)3Br] has been studied previously by Oskam et al.14 The formation of Mn–Mn upon irradiation of [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]+ is presented here, and monitored by UV-vis and IR spectroscopies (Fig. S3†). First, [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]+ forms [Mn(bpy)(CO)2(MeCN)2]+ after initial exposure to 395 nm light. In the dark, [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]+ and [Mn(bpy)(CO)2(MeCN)2]+ do not react further with each other and are stable in solution even after 12 h as determined by UV-visible spectroscopy (Fig. 12). Irradiating a mixture of [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]+ and [Mn(bpy)(CO)2(MeCN)2]+ at 517 nm, which is selectively absorbed by the dicarbonyl species, [Mn(bpy)(CO)2(MeCN)2]+, also does not lead to Mn–Mn formation. However, irradiating the mixture with 395 nm light, which is absorbed by [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]+, leads to the formation of Mn–Mn. From this, we conclude that the dicarbonyl species, [Mn(bpy)(CO)2(MeCN)2]+, donates an electron to the excited state of [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]+, forming [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]0 and [Mn(bpy)(CO)2(MeCN)2]2+. The coupling together of two [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]0 moieties then leads to the formation of Mn–Mn, following Scheme 3.
 Fig. 12  UV-vis spectra of Mn–Mn synthesized from the initial irradiation of [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]+ in degassed MeCN, left in the dark under argon at room temperature. The two peaks at 375 nm and a shoulder ∼500 nm correspond to [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]+ and [Mn(bpy)(CO)2(MeCN)2]+, respectively. 
 Scheme 3  Proposed mechanism for the photochemical synthesis of Mn–Mn from [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]+. 
The dominant species present in solution after the reaction of CO2 with Mn–Mn, generated from methods A and B, was the reformation of the starting material. If Mn–Mn was generated from the irradiation of [Mn(bpy)(CO)3Br] or the chemical reduction of [Mn(bpy)(CO)3Br] using Na(Hg), then exposure to CO2 led to the reformation of [Mn(bpy)(CO)3Br]. Similarly, if Mn–Mn was formed via irradiation of [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]+, the primary product after the introduction of CO2 was the reformation of [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]+ (Fig. S4 and S5†).
In addition to introducing CO2 after Mn–Mn formation, CO2 was also added to the monomeric precursors before irradiation using method B. When either [Mn(bpy)(CO)3Br] or [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]+ are irradiated in MeCN that is already saturated with CO2, no Mn–Mn is observed (Fig. S6 and S7†). These results strongly imply that CO2 is interacting with the radical precursor to Mn–Mn, suppressing dimer formation. A similar result was observed by Meyer for the rhenium analogue.38
It is well known that photolysis of metal–metal bonded dimers can lead to the homolytic cleavage of the metal–metal bond.35,36,39 In cases where Mn–Mn is irradiated, it is expected that Mn˙ forms. However, we now report that even in the dark, Mn–Mn is thermally unstable at room temperature and will dissociate to form the radical species over the course of an hour under argon, as monitored via UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 12). Thus, even without irradiation, the Mn˙ species will be present in solution.
To evaluate the observed thermal instability of Mn–Mn, PPh3 was introduced into a solution of Mn–Mn in the dark. The resultant solution was monitored by 31P NMR, revealing the formation of a [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(PPh3)]+ species. The same product was observed by 31P NMR when a mixture of [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]+ and PPh3 was irradiated with 395 nm light (Fig. S8†). The formation of a PPh3-coordinated complex under these conditions shows that Mn–Mn does cleave in the dark to form [Mn(bpy)(CO)3˙], and that its open coordination site can bind PPh3. Similarly, we propose that [Mn(bpy)(CO)3˙], thermally formed from Mn–Mn dissociation is capable of binding CO2 in the dark.
To further demonstrate that light is not required to bind CO2 with [Mn(bpy)(CO)3˙], a solution of Mn–Mn was first synthesized in the dark from [Mn(bpy)(CO)3Br] and Na(Hg) following method A. This method insured that Mn–Mn could not have homolytically cleaved due to any light used to photochemically synthesize Mn–Mn from a monomeric precursor. A CO2-saturated MeCN solution was then introduced in the dark to a degassed MeCN solution of Mn–Mn under argon. The reaction solution changed color from dark green-brown to orange upon addition of the CO2 solution. While the solution under argon containing only Mn–Mn in degassed MeCN is EPR silent, a distinct MnII signal arose when CO2 was added to the solution (Fig. S9†). This MnII signal is consistent with the theory that two electrons are donated by the Mn0 center to reduce CO2.29,32 Attempts to further study this MnII species via UV-vis were unsuccessful. Although Deronzier suggested that the related mer-[MnII(dmbpy)(CO)3(C(O)OH)]+ species was stable due to persistent peaks in the UV-vis at λmax = 360 and 500 nm,29 these peaks most likely correspond to the solvent-ligated Mn complexes: [Mn(dmbpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]+ and [Mn(dmbpy)(CO)2(MeCN)2]+. To explore this idea, the complexes, [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]+ and [Mn(bpy)(CO)2(MeCN)2]+, were synthesized independently and their UV-vis spectra were found to match those two peaks, respectively. Thus, the prior literature and our IR spectroscopic analysis argue for the reaction depicted in Scheme 4.
 Scheme 4  Proposed mechanism of the dark reaction between [Mn(bpy)(CO)3˙] and CO2, resulting in a MnII complex. 
In support of the reactivity shown in Scheme 4, the liquid phase IR spectrum that resulted from the dark reaction between Mn–Mn and CO2 (Fig. 13) revealed a peak at 1633 cm−1 in the OCO stretching region, characteristic of a carboxylic acid group bound to a metal center.40,41 This 1633 cm−1 does not correspond to known signals for free HCO3−/CO32− which would be located at 1684 and 1646 cm−1,42 or for water which would appear at 1654 cm−1.43 The peaks at 2027, 1933, and 1923 cm−1 correlate with [Mn(bpy)(CO)3Br], while the small shoulder peaks at 2049 and 1957 cm−1 are due to [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]+. When this solution, now mostly containing [Mn(bpy)(CO)3Br] is irradiated at 395 nm, Mn–Mn is regenerated, the peak at 1633 cm−1 increases slightly, and a small peak at 2036 cm−1 is more clearly revealed (Fig. S4†). The peak at 2036 cm−1 is identified as an axial carbonyl ligand based upon similar species, which is most likely associated with the MnII-C(O)OH intermediate shown in Scheme 4.18,20 Although, this vibration is ∼20 cm−1 higher than the reported axial carbonyl peaks for the fac-[MnI-C(O)OH] and fac-[ReI-C(O)OH] species,44,45 this shift in peak position can be accounted for by the difference in their isomeric forms.14
 Fig. 13  IR spectra before and after Mn–Mn in degassed MeCN was quickly combined with CO2-saturated MeCN in the dark. 
While there is a dark reaction between [Mn(bpy)(CO)3˙] and CO2, gas phase IR spectroscopy (Fig. S10†) shows that no CO is produced in the dark over the course of 1 h by this reaction. Only after irradiating a solution of Mn–Mn, in the presence of protons at 395 nm, is CO detected in the headspace gas. It is likely that this CO comes from the photochemical decomposition of Mn–Mn.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the photoevolution of the CN-bridged Mn2CN+ in MeCN was examined using UV-vis and IR spectroscopy. Excitation of the MLCT state promotes axial CO dissociation followed by MeCN solvent ligation. By comparing experimental observables with computational results, we demonstrated that the identity of the intermediate is MeCN ligated at the C-terminus of the complex (s-Mn2CN+), rather than the N-terminus (Mn2CN+-s). Moreover, excited-state dynamics of Mn2CN+ were investigated by TA spectroscopy with and without stirring of the reaction media. In the coordinating solvent (MeCN), there is a long-lived (∼7 ns) PIA corresponding to s-Mn2CN+ when the solution is stirred, with and without the presence of oxygen. Without stirring in degassed MeCN, ground state bleaches of the Mn–Mn dimer are observed.
We have also presented evidence for the unexpected role of trace O2 in this chemistry as a destructive force that prevents Mn–Mn from forming. Since, Mn–Mn is relatively unstable at room temperature and dissociates in solution in the dark, we report that Mn˙ interacts with CO2.
Photolysis experiments with concurrent UV-vis spectra show that the presence of Mn–Mn coincides with the generation of CO. This was further supported with gas phase IR evidence that 13CO2 is only converted to 13CO in the rigorous absence of O2 and under irradiation. Previous literature accounts of Mn tricarbonyl complexes acting as CO production catalysts failed to take into account the CO formed by ligand dissociation. By using 13CO2, true quantum yields for CO production via CO2 reduction are reported here. Furthermore, we were able to show that a mer MnII-C(O)OH species is present after CO2 is exposed to Mn–Mn through EPR and IR spectroscopies. Thus, we present a scheme for how Mn–Mn is generated from Mn2CN+, and suggest that the Mn˙ is the key photochemical reagent for CO2 reduction to CO.
Experimental section
General
All reagents (reagent grade) were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. Anhydrous MeCN were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sure/Seal) and degassed using the freeze–pump–thaw method before use. The {[Mn(bpy)(CO)3]2(μ-CN)}[ClO4] (Mn2CN+) complex was synthesized according to the published method which couples [Mn(bpy)(CO)3Br] to [Mn(bpy)(CO)3CN] under an inert atmosphere using AgClO4 in dry dichloromethane (DCM).22 The complexes, [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)](PF6) and [Mn(bpy)(CO)2(MeCN)2](PF6), were synthesized following previous literature procedures.15,46Mn–Mn was synthesized from an adapted literature procedure where Na(Hg) was used instead of KC8.47 Samples were carefully handled with minimal light exposure.
Instrumentation
FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Model iS50 FT-IR. The model of the optical filter used to follow photolysis experiments with simultaneous IR spectroscopy is Thorlabs NE2R05A. Ultrafast transient absorption measurements were conducted with pulses from a 1 kHz Ti:Sapphire regenerative amplifier system (Libra, Coherent). Libra produces ∼45 fs 800 nm pulses at ∼4 W power. Libra output was separated with a 90-10 (r-t) beam splitter to generate the pump and probe, respectively. The reflected portion of the beam was directed into a commercial optical parametric amplifier (OPerA, Coherent) to generate the 365 nm pump. Both the OPerA output and the transmitted portion of the of the 800 nm beam were directed into a commercial transient absorption spectrometer (Helios, Ultrafast system). The pump was chopped at 500 Hz. The transmitted 800 nm beam was mechanically delayed before being focused into a continuously translated CaF2 window for white light generation. Relative pump and probe polarization was set at the “magic angle” using a π/2 waveplate in the path of the pump. Incident pump power was kept below 150 μW. UV–vis spectra were monitored using a Cary 60 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies). EPR measurements at 10 K were performed on a Bruker EMXplus EPR Spectrometer outfitted with an Oxford liquid helium cryostat.
Photochemical and photophysical study
In the IR studies, the gastight, demountable liquid cell was assembled with two CaF2 windows with 1 mm pathlength (PIKE, 162-1100-02). 10 mM Mn2CN+ in MeCN was prepared and transferred to the IR cell in a glove box. To introduce CO2 to Mn–Mn, a solution of Mn–Mn was rapidly mixed under inert atmosphere with CO2-saturated MeCN and transferred to the IR cell immediately before data collection. In transient absorption studies, a solution of 300 μM analyte in MeCN was excited by a 365 nm laser and probed under constant stirring in a 2 mm path length quartz cuvette (Starna Cells) customized with a J Young joint. In the control experiment with 13CO2, a solution of 5 mL degassed MeCN with 1 M phenol and 1 mM of Mn2CN+ or 6 mM Mn–Mn in a clear borosilicate glass vial sealed with a PTFE/silicone septum (Supelco) was irradiated with a 395 nm LED light (3 W) under constant stirring and the headspace was sampled using a gas cell terminated by KBr plates. Photolysis experiments with 12CO2 were carried out the same way and CO gas was detected via headspace analysis using a 120 °C isothermal method over 1.2 min on a HP 6890 Gas Chromatograph and TCD with a Molsieve 5A PLOT capillary column (Agilent) running He as the flow gas. UV-vis experiments were performed by loading a 1 cm pathlength quartz cuvette fitted with a septum with 0.1 mM Mn2CN+ in degassed MeCN in the glovebox. The cuvette was then tightly capped and for photolysis experiments, CO2 was bubbled in for 15 min.
Computational methodology
Gaussian 1648via density functional theory (DFT) with the M0649 functional level of theory and 6-311G** basis set50 were used to perform geometry optimization and frequency calculations of the ground-state, singlet and doublet of molecules of interest. In order to alleviate computational cost, we applied LANL2DZ basis set on the manganese metal center. LANL2DZ basis set51 describes inner electrons of the metal with effective core potentials. Additionally, polarizable continuum model (PCM)52 with acetonitrile was utilized, since all photochemical measurements were conducted in the presence of acetonitrile. All frequency calculations carried out on stationary points yielded zero imaginary frequencies. HOMO and LUMO energy levels were extracted from the calculations.

 	Fig. 12  UV-vis spectra of Mn–Mn synthesized from the initial irradiation of [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]+ in degassed MeCN, left in the dark under argon at room temperature. The two peaks at 375 nm and a shoulder ∼500 nm correspond to [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]+ and [Mn(bpy)(CO)2(MeCN)2]+, respectively.	 

 	Scheme 3  Proposed mechanism for the photochemical synthesis of Mn–Mn from [Mn(bpy)(CO)3(MeCN)]+.	 

 	Scheme 4  Proposed mechanism of the dark reaction between [Mn(bpy)(CO)3˙] and CO2, resulting in a MnII complex.	 

 	Fig. 13  IR spectra before and after Mn–Mn in degassed MeCN was quickly combined with CO2-saturated MeCN in the dark.
