    , Accepted 5th October 2015First published on 6th October 2015AbstractSensitizers with high triplet quantum yields are useful for generating photovoltaics, photocatalysts and photodynamic therapy agents with increased efficiency. In this study, the heavy atom effect was used to optimize the triplet and singlet oxygen quantum yields of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carbomethoxyphenyl)porphyrin (1-TCM4PP). The triplet quantum yields, determined using delayed fluorescence, was calculated as 0.35 for 1-TCM4PP, 0.75 for 5,10,15-tris(4-carbomethoxyphenyl)-20-(4-bromophenyl)porphyrin (2-TBCM3PP) and 0.88 for 5,10,15-tris(4-carbomethoxyphenyl)-20-(4-iodophenyl)porphyrin (3-TCM3IPP). Chemical quenching of 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran and singlet oxygen emission studies rendered an average singlet oxygen quantum yield of 0.51, 0.75, and 0.90 for TCM4PP, TBCM3PP and TCM3IPP respectively. These photophysical properties indicate that a single halogen atom is capable of transforming TCM4PP into a sensitizer with strong triplet character. This is useful for generating singlet oxygen for photodynamic therapy, creating a long lasting reactive species for catalysis and for extending diffusion lengths in photovoltaic applications while retaining three molecular modification points for further functionalization.
Introduction
Porphyrins are organic semiconducting molecules extensively researched for use in solar energy conversion, light induced chemical catalysis, imaging and therapeutics.1,2 Their incorporation into these diverse technologies can be attributed to their unique photo-physical properties that can be modified through chemical engineering and device architecture. Once an exciton is generated via light absorption, the electron populates the excited singlet state. One distinguishing feature of porphyrins is their ability to undergo intersystem crossing, normally a spin forbidden process, from the singlet into the triplet excited state. Porphyrin sensitizers with high efficiencies of triplet formation can be used to improve the efficiency of photovoltaics and photo-catalysts because the triplet state has a characteristically long lifetime.3 This allows excitons more time to diffuse to an interface before recombining and provides a longer lasting reactive species for catalysis.4,5 The triplet state of a porphyrin is also capable of creating singlet oxygen, a powerful oxidant that can damage tumor cells for therapeutic purposes.1,2
One approach to increase the efficiency of triplet formation is to covalently attach or coordinate a heavy atom, such as a halogen or transition metal, to the porphyrin structure.6–9 Heavy atoms promote intersystem crossing into the triplet state due to spin-orbit coupling.10 Studies have demonstrated that a single bromine or iodine substituent at the β-pyrrole or meso position of octaethylporphyrin increases the triplet quantum yield up to 85%.6 However a bromine atom in the meso position can cause buckling of the porphyrin core and halogen atoms on the β-pyrrole position increases the rate of triplet decay.6,7 Similar molecules with multiple halogen atoms located on the phenyl rings of tetraphenylporphyrin derivatives show that the triplet quantum yield generally increases with an increase in the size of the heavy atom.6–9,11–13 However information gleaned from these studies is complicated due to the number, variety and different positions of heavy atom substituents as well as the different parameters reported for each study. The significance of the following research is that it demonstrates the effect of a single halogen atom substitution for one carbomethoxy substituent on one of the phenyl rings of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carbomethoxyphenyl)porphyrin. The use of only a single halogen is advantageous because it allows the remaining three carbomethoxy groups on the meso phenyl rings of the porphyrin core to act as molecular modification points for further functionalization. The structures of the different carbomethoxyphenylporphyrin derivatives studied are shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  The structures and names of the three different carbomethoxyphenylporphyrin derivatives characterized in this study. The following abbreviations are used: 1 = TCM4PP, 2 = TBCM3PP and 3 = TCM3IPP. 
In order to successfully engineer these newly synthesized porphyrin dyes into solar cells or use them as photo-catalysts or photodynamic therapy agents, the photophysical properties of the dyes in solution were determined. The photophysical properties include (1) absorption and emission profiles, (2) rates of conversion, (3) lifetimes and (4) the efficiency with which the singlet and triplet excited states form. The work presented here complements Weisman's triplet–triplet annihilation method to determine triplet quantum yields.14 Both the delayed fluorescence and the fast singlet fluorescence can be measured using the same time resolved fluorescence setup with a gated multi-pulsed excitation technique.15 In addition, a comparison of the singlet oxygen quantum yields obtained using two different techniques is presented.
Results and discussion
Absorption and emission spectra
The absorption and emission spectra for (1) TCM4PP, (2) TBCM3PP and (3) TCM3IPP are shown in Fig. 2 and 3. All three derivatives have identical molar absorptivities and absorption peaks in the Soret band region (350–450 nm) and four Q bands (500–650 nm).16 The emission spectra show peaks at approximately 653 nm and 717 nm. (1) TCM4PP exhibits the highest fluorescence, followed by (2) TBCM3PP and (3) TCM3IPP.

Lifetimes and singlet excited state quantum yields
The fluorescence lifetime decay profiles for the porphyrin derivatives are depicted in Fig. 4. The fluorescence lifetimes (τF), fluorescence quantum yields (ϕF), and fluorescence radiative decay rates (kF) are listed in Table 1. Both Fig. 4 and Table 1 show that (1) TCM4PP has the longest lifetime of 9.22 ns, followed by (2) TBCM3PP with a lifetime of 5.26 ns and then (3) TCM3IPP with the shortest lifetime of 2.22 ns. Fluorescence quantum yields for TCM4PP, TBCM3PP and TCM3IPP were calculated using the comparative method, as shown in eqn (1).17–20 Tetratolylporphyrin was used as the reference, with a quantum yield of 0.11 in DCM.17,18,21 (1)In eqn (1), ϕ represents the fluorescence quantum yield, m represents the slope when the area of the emission peak is plotted against the absorption of the fluorophore at the excitation wavelength at various concentrations. The subscript Std represents the variables for the reference compound and n is the refractive index of the solvent. The fluorescent quantum yields also decreased with halogenation and were determined to be 0.09, 0.04 and 0.02 for (1) TCM4PP, (2) TBCM3PP and (3) TCM3IPP respectively. The fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime obtained for TCM4PP in DCM are similar to those reported in chloroform with a ϕF of 0.11 and a τF of 9.2 ns.12 The decreasing trend in the fluorescence emission, lifetime and quantum yield of (2) TBCM3PP and (3) TCM3IPP compared to (1) TCM4PP is due to the heavy atom effect. The heavy halogen nuclei induce spin-orbit coupling and promote intersystem crossing into the triplet state.4 Thereby, the heavy atoms quench the excited singlet state.

Triplet state quantum yields
Bachilo and Weisman have shown that delayed fluorescence arising due to triplet–triplet recombination can be used to accurately calculate triplet quantum yields. However, the delayed fluorescence signal is several orders of magnitude weaker than singlet fluorescence, and may last for hundreds of microseconds. A single short laser pulse (a few hundred femtoseconds long) typically employed to measure fast fluorescence dynamics is insufficient to build up a significant triplet population, in order to observe weak emission by triplet–triplet annihilation. One way to overcome this obstacle is to use excitation pulses of longer duration as employed by Bachilo and Weisman in their study. However, that would make the recording of fluorescence unfeasible. Another way is to use a burst of high repetition rate pulses to build up the triplet state population. The co-authors in this study have previously demonstrated a gated time-resolved fluorescence technique that involves exciting a sample with a controllable number of 80 MHz laser pulses.15 Without any change in the optical setup, a simple variation in the length of the electronic gate signal allows us to vary the number of excitation pulses from one to the number desired.
In this study, we use the above mentioned multi-pulse time resolved fluorescence technique (see Experimental methods for more detail) to excite each sample with a pulse train consisting of 100 pulses with an inter-pulse separation of 12.5 ns. Fig. 5 shows the multi-pulse prompt and delayed fluorescence decays for various samples. Clearly, the emission decay consists of a fast singlet fluorescence peak in the early period, and a weak but very long decay component building up on account of triplet–triplet recombination.

The triplet quantum yield for porphyrins were calculated as described previously and shown in eqn (2): (2)where Q is calculated as the area under the prompt divided by the intensity of the delayed fluorescence at time zero.14 The prompt fluorescence represents the fast component of fluorescence emission, when the electron recombines with a hole after occupying the singlet state only. The prominence of the prompt fluorescence with respect to delayed fluorescence is clearly visualized when displayed on the full linear axis, where the delayed fluorescence makes a negligible contribution. The second order rate constant for triplet–triplet annihilation, kA, was found by fitting the intensity of the delayed fluorescence to eqn (3).14 (3) The variable α represents instrument sensitivity, kEncTT is the triplet–triplet encounter rate constant, and [3S*]0 stands for the concentration of triplets at t equal to zero, where t is time. The multi-pulsed triplet–triplet annihilation technique was performed using 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin as the control and a triplet quantum yield matching the literature value was obtained.14 The prompt and delayed fluorescence decay profiles for the three derivatives are shown in Fig. 5. Their corresponding averaged lifetimes are displayed as well. A comparison of the delayed fluorescence reveals that TCM3IPP has the highest intensity of delayed fluorescence, which decays at a faster rate than the other two derivatives. TBCM3PP has the second highest intensity of triplet–triplet annihilation followed by TCM4PP. The triplet quantum yields and their corresponding rate of intersystem crossing are listed in Table 1.
The triplet quantum yield for TCM4PP is 0.35 which is 50% lower than the triplet quantum yield for tetraphenylporphyrin (ϕT = ∼0.70).7,14 This indicates that the carbomethoxy groups destabilize the singlet to triplet transition. Nevertheless, substituting an iodine for one of the carbomethoxy substituents on TCM4PP increases the efficiency of triplet formation by 151% to 0.88. Such a large increase is impressive when considering the non-planarity and distance of the iodophenyl substituent from the conjugated porphyrin core of π electrons. The calculated triplet quantum yield for TBCM3PP increased 114% to 0.75. The rates of intersystem crossing were calculated as 3.80 × 107 s−1, 1.43 × 108 s−1, and 3.96 × 108 s−1 for TCM4PP, TBCM3PP and TCM3IPP respectively. The increasing efficiency of triplet formation in the presence of a heavy halogen is a direct consequence of the interaction between the magnetic field produced by the heavy atom and the magnetic moment of the molecule's valence electron, which has been excited into the LUMO level by the electric field of the exciting light.10 Iodine, the heaviest atom, has the most pronounced increase in the efficiency of triplet formation because it is larger and therefore has the strongest spin-orbit coupling.
Singlet oxygen quantum yields

Chemical quenching with DPBF. 
Singlet oxygen is generated as a result of energy transfer from a triplet state porphyrin to molecular oxygen and therefore is often a good indicator of triplet formation. The quantum yields of singlet oxygen were determined using chemical quenching of DPBF and the comparative method with singlet oxygen emission. The efficiency of DPBF oxidation was calculated according to eqn (4).20,22–24 (4) In eqn (4), t is the time interval, Ia represents the number of photons absorbed per unit time, kr is the rate constant for the reaction between singlet oxygen and DPBF and kd is the rate constant for the decay of singlet oxygen.20,22–24 Conventionally ϕΔ, the singlet oxygen quantum yield, is obtained from Stern–Volmer plots of the data as shown in eqn (5).20,22,23,25 (5) However, low coefficients of determination were obtained due to small variations in the change in DPBF concentration, even though the time intervals were constant. Therefore another approach, reported by Figueiredo et al., was applied in which eqn (1) was integrated to yield eqn (6).23,26 (6) The reported value for kdkr−1 in DMF is 2 × 10−5.27Ia in eqn (6) represents the moles of photons absorbed per unit time and volume, and is calculated using eqn (7). (7) Absλex is the absorbance of the photosensitizer at the excitation wavelength, A represents the area of irradiation, NA is Avogadro's number and V is the reaction volume. Np is the number of photons per unit area per second and is calculated according to eqn (8), (8)where P is power, λex is the wavelength of light exposure, h is Planks constant and c is the speed of light. The singlet oxygen quantum yield was determined by dividing the slope generated from the graph of the left side of eqn (6) with respect to time, by Ia. The extinction coefficient used for DPBF in DMF at 408 nm was 20,744 L mol−1 cm−1. Quantum yields for singlet oxygen generation were acquired by measuring the change in DPBF concentration as a function of illumination time with 552 nm light. Fig. 6 shows the depletion of DPBF with time of light exposure for (1) TCM4PP, (2) TBCM3PP and (3) TCM3IPP. This data was applied to eqn (6) and the plot generated is shown in Fig. 7. As indicated in Table 2, the singlet oxygen quantum yields were calculated as 0.54 ± 0.07, 0.74 ± 0.02 and 0.91 ± 0.06 for (1) TCM4PP, (2) TBCM3PP, and (3) TCM3IPP. The upward trend in singlet oxygen generation with increasing mass of heavy atom substituent is a direct result of the heavy atom effect. The spin orbit coupling produced by iodine or bromine facilitates intersystem crossing into the triplet state, which enables energy transfer to molecular oxygen.1,5,22,23,28,29 Energy transfer from the porphyrin in the triplet state to molecular oxygen generates singlet oxygen, which then degrades DPBF.30

Singlet oxygen quantum yield were calculated by dividing the slope of the line by Ia. Ia was calculated using eqn (7). The singlet oxygen quantum yields for (1) TCM4PP, (2) TBCM3PP and (3) TCM3IPP are 0.54 ± 0.07, 0.74 ± 0.02 and 0.91 ± 0.06.

Comparative method with singlet oxygen emission. 
Low coefficients of determination and overlap of the porphyrin absorption peak with the absorption of DPBF (subtractions were performed) motivated us to determined the singlet oxygen quantum yield using the comparative method of singlet oxygen emission. Eqn (9) was used to calculate the singlet oxygen quantum yield. TPP was used as the standard with a reported quantum yield of 0.7.31 (9) The singlet oxygen emission profiles for all three compounds are shown in Fig. 8 and the quantum yields were measured as 0.47 for (1) TCM4PP, 0.76 for (2) TBCM3PP and 0.89 for (3) TCM3IPP, as shown in Table 2.
 Fig. 8  Singlet oxygen emission of 2 × 10−5 M solutions of (1) TCM4PP (■), (2) TBCM3PP (●) and (3) TCM3IPP (Δ) in toluene. 
The singlet oxygen quantum yields obtained for (1) TCM4PP using both methods are approximate to the singlet oxygen quantum yield of 0.49 reported in chloroform.12 These experiments indicates that only one iodine atom on the meso phenyl ring of the porphyrin molecule is necessary to achieve a 69–89% increase in the singlet oxygen quantum yield. A smaller, yet significant 37–61% increase in the singlet oxygen quantum yield is observed with a single bromine atom. The differences in the singlet oxygen quantum yields acquired for each sample, using the two different methods, is no greater than ten percent. This indicates that the two different methods are comparable and that the values obtained are reliable.

Experimental
Materials
The mixed-substituent porphyrin derivatives were synthesized and purified according to previous methods.32 Triethylamine, leutidine, dichloromethane, 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran, pyrrole and N,N-dimethylformamide were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used as supplied except pyrrole, which was distilled before use.
Absorption, emission and lifetime measurements
Absorption, fluorescence emission, and fluorescence lifetime measurements were taken on aerated and degassed solutions of approximately 2 × 10−5 M in DCM. Triethylamine or leutidine (∼10 μL/4 mL) was added to prevent protonation and outgassing was accomplished using the pump–freeze–thaw method. A Varian Cary 300 spectrometer was used to detect absorption. Steady state fluorescence emission and excitation were measured on a Shimadzu RF5301 PC fluorometer or on a Jobin Yvon Fluorolog 3. Time correlated single photon counting was obtained on the Fluorolog equipped with a 341 nm photodiode laser. The lifetimes of the corresponding derivatives were obtained by fitting the data using Igor Pro software.
Fluorescence quantum yields
The fluorescence quantum yields were determined in DCM using 552 nm as the excitation wavelength. Absorption at the excitation wavelength was measured on the Cary 300 and emission was measured on a Shimadzu RF5301 PC fluorometer. The excitation and emission slit widths were 1.5 nm and the integrated area of each emission peak was measured using “Fluorescence” software.
Triplet quantum yields
Triplet–triplet annihilation fluorescence was recorded using a femtosecond Ti:saphire laser (Spectra Physics MaiTai), operating at 80 MHz repetition rate and 820 nm. The laser output was fed to an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) (Spectra Physics Inspire). The frequency-doubled output (410 nm) from the OPO was then directed through two electro-optic modulators (Conoptics 350-105 KD*P Series) driven by a high voltage push–pull power amplifier. A delay generator (SRS DG535), externally triggered by a synchronous counter operating at 4 kHz, was used to produce an electronic gate of variable length, which determined the length of the optical gate opened by the pulse-picker system. An electronic gate of suitable length was chosen to excite the sample with 100 pulses. The excitation light was focused on a degassed sample solution inside a 10 mm sealed quartz cuvette. Fluorescence dynamics were measured by time correlated single photon counting, using a multichannel photon counting board (Becker & Hickl DPC 230) with a double monochromator (Spectral Products CM112) and a hybrid PMT detector (Becker & Hickl HPM-100-40). The delayed fluorescence data was fit using Igor Pro software with the second order rate constant for triplet–triplet annihilation constrained between 13000 s−1 and 24000 s−1.
Singlet oxygen quantum yields
The quantum yield for singlet oxygen was determined by chemical quenching with DPBF in DMF using 552 nm monochromatic light from a Newport monochromator and xenon lamp similar to methods already reported.20,22,23 To summarize, a reaction mixture (4 mL) of DPBF (∼5 × 10−5 M) and porphyrin (5–10 × 10−6 M) was prepared and promptly dispensed in a (1 cm × 1 cm) quartz cuvette. The absorbance of the reaction was monitored at 552 nm to determine the absorption of the photosensitizer at the excitation wavelength and at 408 nm to monitor DPBF depletion. The reaction was mixed as it was illuminated. Light exposure was maintained for timed intervals (30–100 s) which produced a ∼5% change in DPBF concentration. The timed light exposure was controlled with a shutter and the intensity was measured using a Newport silicon detector connected to a CEN-TECH digital multi-meter. The average measured light intensity was ∼4.9 W m−2. A reference spectrum of the porphyrin in DMF was taken before each experiment and subtracted from the final data. The experiments were performed at least three times for each sensitizer and at least fourteen timed intervals were measured. The comparative method of singlet oxygen emission was performed on aerated 2 × 10−5 M solutions. The emission was filtered with an 850 nm long pass filter and the resulting spectrum is an average of 10 scans with an integration time of 2 seconds each. The samples were excited with 514 nm light with an excitation slit width of 14.7 nm and an emission slit width of 10 nm. The spectra were corrected for dark counts and for excitation light fluctuations.
Conclusion
The decrease in emission, lifetime and fluorescent quantum yields, and increase in the triplet and singlet oxygen quantum yields is a consequence of the “heavy atom effect”. The prudent use of just one heavy halogen substituent and its considerable effect on triplet formation and singlet oxygen generation is noteworthy and allows for further functionalization of the molecule. We envision that the remaining three carbomethoxy groups can be used as molecular modification points for nanoparticle formation or for possible targeting ligands.33 The high triplet and singlet oxygen quantum yields of the heavy atom derivatives implies that they are suitable candidates for photodynamic therapy and for solar cells designed to extract electrons from the triplet state. The triplet state quantum yields were measured by applying a multi-pulsed excitation in order to build a significant triplet population for analysis with Weisman's triplet–triplet annihilation method.14,15 The singlet oxygen quantum yields calculated using chemical quenching of DPBF and singlet oxygen emission match the reported value for TCM4PP within standard deviation, and the singlet oxygen quantum yields for TBCM3PP and TCM3IPP are within standard deviations of each other.14,15
