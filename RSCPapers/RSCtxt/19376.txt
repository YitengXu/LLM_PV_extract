In this study, the direction of free charge generation is defined as the direction from the interface to the side where free charges are left. For a p–n type device, the direction of free electron (hole) generation from exciton dissociation at the donor/accepter (D/A) interface is the same as the subsequent transportation direction under the built-in electric field. However, the direction of free electron (hole) generation from exciton–exciton recombination across the D/A interface is opposite to the direction of free charge transportation. Both free charges generated from exciton interfacial dissociation and recombination are contributed to the photocurrent for a p–n type device. In a device with a heterojunction formed by two n-type materials (here it is defined as an n–n type device), the direction of free electron (hole) generation from exciton recombination across the interface is also the same as the subsequent free charge transportation. At the same time, there are also some free electrons (free holes) generated by exciton interfacial dissociation. The direction of free charge generation from exciton dissociation for this n–n type device is also opposite to the direction of free charge transportation. However, only free charges generated from exciton interfacial recombination are contributed to the photocurrent for an n–n type device. But so far there has been no direct experimental evidence to prove the above theories. In this work, an NPB interfacial layer with a high LUMO was introduced in an n–n type OSC to inhibit the backflow of electrons, which are generated from exciton dissociation at the heterojunction formed by two n-type materials, enhancing the device performance accordingly. This work is conducive to interfacial engineering in an OSC to further improve its performance.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSC) are regarded as a candidate of renewable energy technologies because of their advantages such as low cost, light weight, various functional materials, large-scale production and highly processable flexibility.1,2 Even beyond 11% of power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been reported,3,4 it still cannot meet the requirement of industrialization. Many factors limit the further improvement in PCE of OSC, for example, unbalanced charge mobility, low absorption efficiency, unclear interfacial physical processes and so on.5–7 Many physical processes such as exciton interfacial dissociation, exciton interfacial recombination, and exciton–electron and exciton–hole interactions coexist at the heterogeneous interface in OSC, which are critical to the performance of OSC.8–15 The free carriers in OSC are from these processes, and the contributions from different processes are not the same. A large number of studies have shown that the main contribution of free carriers in a p–n type device is from the exciton dissociation at the D–A interface.16–19 The D–A interface is formed by different highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of p- and n-type materials.20 The exciton dissociation transfers electrons (holes) of excitons from a p- (n-) type material to the LUMO (HOMO) of an n- (p-) type material, leaving holes (electrons) in the HOMO (LUMO) of the p- (n-) type material.21 The following transportation of these generated free charges under the built-in electric field moves electrons and holes to the cathode and the anode, respectively. In this study, if the direction of free charge generation is defined as the direction from the interface to the side where free charges are left, we can find that both directions of electron and hole generation in a p–n type device are the same as their subsequent transportation under the built-in electric field. This situation is marked as process I. Another process which is marked as process II describes the situation that the direction of the free charge generation is opposite to the subsequent charge transportation. In the p–n type device, the process II is the exciton interfacial recombination to generate free carriers and the subsequent free carrier drift across the interface and then to electrodes under the built-in electric field. In the process of exciton recombination across the p–n interface, the hole of exciton from the p-type semiconductor recombines across the p–n interface with the electron of exciton from the n-type semiconductor, releasing the free electron of exciton in the p-type semiconductor and the free hole of exciton in the n-type semiconductor, respectively. These free electrons and holes generated from this interfacial exciton recombination pass through the p–n interface first, then they were collected by the cathode and the anode, respectively. It is obvious that both processes I and II in the p–n type device contribute positively to the final photocurrent. It is very hard to distinguish the contribution from processes I and II even though they are different. Obviously, the direction of the free charge generation and the subsequent charge transportation would directly affect the performance of OSC. Therefore, it is necessary to understand and clarify the influence of processes I and II on the performance of OSC.
It is very hard to distinguish the contribution of processes I and II in a p–n type device. Fortunately, by using a new device structure which was developed by Song et al.,9 the role of the processes I and II can be differentiated. In this device, with a heterojunction formed by two n-type materials (here it is defined as n–n type device), the photocurrent is mainly generated by exciton–exciton recombination across an n–n interface. The exciton–exciton recombination has been verified by the bilayer planar heterojunction solar cells using two n-type materials, fullerene (C60) and perfluorinated hexadecafluorophthalo-cyaninatozinc (F16ZnPc),22–24 as shown in Fig. 1. Due to the recombination between the hole of exciton from C60 and the electron of exciton from F16ZnPc, the electron of exciton from C60 and the hole of exciton from F16ZnPc are released and left in C60 and F16ZnPc, respectively. These free electrons and holes drift to the cathode and the anode, respectively, under the built-in electric field. The direction of free carrier generation through interfacial recombination is the same as the subsequent direction of charge transportation. So the interfacial exciton recombination is the process I in the n–n type device. At the n–n interface of C60–F16ZnPc, except the process I (interfacial exciton recombination across the n–n interface), the process II (the direction of the free charge generation is opposite to the subsequent charge transportation) also happens at the same time. The process II in an n–n type device is exciton dissociation at the C60–F16ZnPc interface. During this process, electrons (holes) of excitons from C60 (F16ZnPc) dissociate into F16ZnPc (C60), leaving free holes in C60 (F16ZnPc). Those free carriers generated by the exciton dissociation are accumulated at the C60–F16ZnPc interface under the force of the built-in electric field. Because of the energy barrier encountered by those free carriers generated by the process II, they cannot drift to the electrode. Unlike the process II in a p–n device, free carriers generated from the process II in an n–n type device have no or even negative contribution to the photocurrent. The free electrons (holes) generated from the process II, and their movement, are thus called as backflow electrons (holes) in this study. One of the reasons for the low performance of an n–n type device is likely to be the existence of these backflow electrons (holes). They would annihilate at the C60–F16ZnPc interface and quench the excitons from both sides of the interface (see Fig. 1(b)).

So far, there is no direct observation of the process II, neither the positive contribution in p–n devices nor the negative contribution in n–n type devices. By analyzing the energy level of an n–n type device, it is easy to find out that the insertion of a material between C60 and F16ZnPc with a higher LUMO level than C60 can prevent the dissociation of excitons, inhibiting the electron transfer from C60 into F16ZnPc. In this work, the process II in an n–n type device is directly observed by inserting (N,N′-di-((1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenyl)-1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine (NPB) between the two n-type materials (see Fig. 1(c) and (d)). The higher located LUMO level of NPB compared to C60 inhibits the electron transfer from C60 into F16ZnPc, relieving the effect of the process II on the photocurrent. Thus the performance and EQE of the n–n type device are improved accordingly.
Experimental section
Materials
F16ZnPc, NPB, C60, and tris-8-hydroxy-quinolinato aluminum (Alq3) were bought from Sigma Aldrich and used as received. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, 4083) was bought from Heraeus.
Device fabrication
All devices were fabricated based on a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/F16ZnPc/NPB(X)/C60/Alq3/Al, in which X are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 20 nm, respectively. A pre-patterned ITO glass substrate with a sheet resistance of about 15 ohm per square was ultrasonically cleaned for 20 minutes by sequentially ultrasonic cleaning in detergent, acetone, and deionized water, respectively. After oxygen plasma treatment, the ITO was covered by spin coating a 40 nm thick PEDOT:PSS layer on top of it. Then, 20 nm thick F16ZnPc was thermally evaporated onto the PEDOT:PSS in vacuum. Next, NPB (with thickness of 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 20 nm) was covered on the F16ZnPc layer via thermally evaporation. A 50 nm thick C60 organic layer and a 10 nm thick Alq3 buffer layer were deposited at a rate of 1.2 nm min−1 and 0.9 nm min−1, respectively. All organic layers were deposited under a pressure of about 8 × 10−6 Pa. Finally, a 100 nm Al electrode was deposited under a vacuum of 2 × 10−5 Pa at a rate of 4 nm min−1 through a shadow mask to define an area around 9 mm2. The deposition rate was monitored in situ using a calibrated quartz oscillator.
Device characterization
The current–voltage (I–V) measurements were carried out using a Keithley 2400 source meter under 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) simulated sunlight from a Newport solar simulator (94043A). The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the devices were calculated from the photocurrent measured by a lock-in amplifier (SR-830). A 150 W xenon lamp was used in conjunction with a monochromator to supply AC modulated monochromatic light. A tungsten lamp of intensity 40 mW cm−2 was employed as a DC white bias light. DC bias lights with filters BP450 and LP780 were realized by inserting an appropriate optical filter of band pass 450 nm wavelength and long pass wavelength 780 nm between the tungsten lamp and the sample, respectively, superimposing onto the chopped monochromatic light. The light intensity was measured using a calibrated Si detector.
Results and discussion
The I–V curves of devices without and with various NPB block layers were measured under 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) simulated sunlight and are shown in Fig. 2(a) and summarized in Table 1. The pristine device without the NPB block layer (0 nm) shows a small short circuit current (Jsc) of 0.47 mA cm−2 and an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.29 V, which are consistent with the previous report.9

Here the main contribution of Jsc was from the exciton–exciton recombination across the C60–F16ZnPc interface. The direction of free carrier generation through interfacial recombination is the same as the subsequent direction of charge transportation. So the process of interfacial exciton recombination is the process I in the n–n type device. At the interface of C60–F16ZnPc, except interfacial exciton recombination across the n–n interface, the dissociation of exciton at this interface also happens at the same time. During this process, electrons (holes) of excitons from C60 (F16ZnPc) dissociate into F16ZnPc (C60), leaving free holes in C60 (F16ZnPc). Because of the energy barrier encountered by those free carriers generated by the dissociation of exciton, they cannot drift to the electrode. Those free carriers generated by the exciton dissociation thus are accumulated at the C60–F16ZnPc interface under the force of the built-in electric field. Since the direction of the free charge generation from exciton dissociation is opposite to the force direction felt by those free carriers under the built-in electric field, the dissociation of exciton at the C60–F16ZnPc interface is via the process II. The free electrons (holes) from the process II would annihilate at the C60–F16ZnPc interface and quench the excitons from both sides of the interface (see Fig. 1(b)), which are thus called the backflow electrons (holes) in this study. One of the reasons for the low performance of n–n type devices is likely to be the existence of these backflow electrons (holes). So we can find that the process I has a positive effect on the performance of the device, while the process II has negative effects in n–n type devices.
In order to verify the existence of the process II in an n–n type device, the insertion of NPB with different thicknesses between C60 and F16ZnPc was studied, as shown in Fig. 2(a) and summarized in Table 1. The Jsc and Voc values of the device were remarkably improved by the insertion of 1 nm NPB between C60 and F16ZnPc. Further increasing the NPB thickness can further improve the Jsc and Voc values of the device. Thus by inserting the NPB with a higher LUMO compared to C60, the electrons of exciton in C60 cannot pass the energy barrier caused by the higher LUMO of NPB. Therefore, the improvement of Jsc and Voc of the device can be explained as the result of effective inhibition of exciton dissociation and then the backflow electrons. These results do confirm the existence of the process II (exciton dissociation) in an n–n type device.
The observation of electron backflow was further confirmed by measuring the EQE of devices with different thicknesses of NPB, as shown in Fig. 2(b). By inserting NPB, the EQEs were drastically enhanced in the wavelength range of 300–650 nm where C60 absorption mainly located and dropped in the wavelength range of 650–850 nm where F16ZnPc absorption located. This observation can be explained as the effective inhibition of exciton dissociation (process II in this device) by the insertion of NPB, thus decreasing the backflow electrons to quench the excitons from both sides of the interface. The slight decrease in EQE in the longer wavelength range is possibly due to the decreasing of exciton recombination (process I in this device) caused by the larger exciton distance after inserting NPB. If so, the thickness of NPB can be used to modulate the process I (exciton recombination).
Exciton recombination and exciton dissociation across the interface (processes I and II in an n–n type device) behave differently under white light and monochromatic light. Excitons from either side can be dissociated at the interface, while exciton recombination can only happen when excitons exist at both sides of the interface. The EQE measurement is normally conducted under monochromatic light. Thus the integral current (Jcal) of the device, which is from the integral of EQE measured under the monochromatic light, is different from Jsc, which is measured under simulated light. Jcal is calculated from the EQE according to:  where PAM1.5 is the standard AM 1.5G solar spectral irradiance, and q, λ, ℏ, and c are the elementary charge, wavelength, Planck's constant, and velocity of light in free space, respectively. The comparison between Jcal and Jsc is shown in Fig. 2(c). It is obvious that the Jcal value is lower than Jsc when NPB is less than 2.5 nm. Since process I (interfacial exciton recombination) in an n–n type device requires excitons from both sides of the interface, it is normally hard to be realized using monochromatic light when it is not absorbed both by C60 and F16ZnPc. When NPB thickness is less than 2.5 nm, the channel of interfacial exciton recombination is not blocked. Thus, the Jcal value is smaller than Jsc when the NPB layer is less than 2.5 nm, as shown in Fig. 2c.
Intuitively, if another light source is used to provide excitons for interfacial recombination, as described elsewhere,9,15 the measured EQE value would increase for the photocurrent originated from exciton recombination. Light in the wavelength range of 650–850 nm is only absorbed by F16ZnPc, while light at the wavelength around 450 nm is mainly absorbed by C60. By using a long wavelength pass filter (LP780) and a band pass filter (BP450), light with wavelength longer than 780 nm and around 450 nm can be used to generate excitons in F16ZnPc and C60, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2d for the device with 3 nm thick NPB, a bias light with the BP450 filter increases the EQE for wavelengths longer than 650 nm and decreases the EQE for wavelengths shorter than 650 nm at the same time. However, a bias light with the LP780 filter, which generates excitons at the F16ZnPc side, shows an opposite effect on the EQE measurement, increasing EQE for wavelengths shorter than 650 nm and decreasing the EQE for wavelengths longer than 650 nm at the same time. Similar results about the EQE increase or decrease under a bias light were analyzed in detail in our previous report.15
To make this bias light effect on EQE measurement clearer, the increase rate of EQE, which is defined as follow, is used:  where EQEBP450, EQELP780 and EQE0 are EQEs of devices measured under the BP450 bias light, LP780 bias light and without bias light, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the increase rate of EQE of devices with different thicknesses of NPB under the bias light with filters LP780 and BP450, respectively. Under the BP450 bias light, the EQE increases in the wavelength range of 650–850 nm and decreases in the range of 300–650 nm, respectively. While under the LP780 bias light, the EQE decreases in the wavelength range of 650–850 nm and increases in the range of 300–650 nm, respectively. All the results consist of the results in Fig. 2 and our previous report.15
 Fig. 3  The increase rate of EQE of devices with various thicknesses of NPB block layers measured under bias light with BP450 (a) and LP780 filters (b). 
By inserting the NPB layer, the process II (exciton dissociation at the F16ZnPc–C60 interface) is inhibited, at the same time, the process I (interfacial exciton recombination across the F16ZnPc–C60 interface) would also be suppressed. It is worth mentioning that the inhibition of process II is accompanied by opening a channel of hole–exciton interaction.15 If excitons are generated in C60, either by bias light or monochromatic light, they can be dissociated at the C60–NPB interface and then free holes are accumulated on NPB. These free holes would interact with excitons in F16ZnPc to generate free holes in F16ZnPc. With the BP450 filter, excitons generated by the bias light are mainly in C60. The EQE increase can be explained as the more recombination chance between monochromatic light generated excitons and excitons in C60 provided by the bias light. The EQE decrease can be explained as the result of exciton quenching by the holes generated from exciton dissociation at the C60–NPB interface. This is also because of the free holes, which quench excitons at the interface, open another channel of hole–exciton interaction to generate a photocurrent. The hole–exciton interaction becomes more and more notable with increasing NPB thickness, because more free holes can be achieved through exciton dissociation at the C60–NPB interface. This is also the reason why the device performance increases with increasing thickness of the NPB layer. With the LP780 filter, excitons generated by the bias light are in F16ZnPc. The EQE increase can be explained as the more recombination chance between monochromatic light generated excitons and excitons in F16ZnPc provided by the bias light. The EQE decrease can also be explained as the result of exciton quenching by the holes generated from exciton dissociation at the F16ZnPc–NPB interface.
An energy diagram for explaining the work principle is shown in Fig. 4(a). By inserting NPB, the photocurrent generation changes from exciton recombination at the F16ZnPc–C60 interface to exciton dissociation at the C60–NPB interface followed by hole–exciton interaction at the NPB–F16ZnPc interface. This time delay of photocurrent generation can possibly be detected via transient photocurrent measurements. Fig. 4(b) shows the transient photocurrents of the devices with various thicknesses of NPB layers. Indeed, the appearance of the photocurrent is slightly late after adding the NPB layer. Without the NPB layer, the photocurrent appears early because it directly comes from exciton–exciton recombination at the F16ZnPc–C60 interface. After inserting a NPB layer, the exciton created in C60 will be dissociated at the NPB–C60 interface to generate free carriers. The free electrons are blocked by the NPB layer, preventing them jumping into F16ZnPc. And the free holes transfer into NPB and then accumulate at the NPB–F16ZnPc interface, where they interact with excitons in F16ZnPc to generate free holes in F16ZnPc. The thicker the NPB is, the longer time the free holes take to transport from the C60–NPB interface to the NPB–F16ZnPc interface, and then the late rising edge of the transient photocurrent.

Conclusions
In summary, the process II (the direction of the free charge generation is opposite to the subsequent direction of charge transportation) has been verified in an n–n type device in this work. The dissociation of exciton in C60 and then the electron backflow are prevented by inserting NPB between C60 and F16ZnPc, improving both the Jsc and Voc values of the device. The analysis of EQE discloses that another process of hole–exciton interaction plays a more and more important role when increasing the thickness of the NPB layer. The observed photovoltaic performance of this n–n type device is thus determined by the interfacial exciton–exciton recombination and the exciton dissociation followed by the hole–exciton interaction.
