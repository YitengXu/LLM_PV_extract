Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) offer an attractive option as a third generation photovoltaic technology due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and potential for low-cost power production as well as indoor (diffuse light) applications.1 To date, PCEs over 12% have been achieved by using organic donor–(π-linker)–acceptor (D–π–A) types of dyes as photosensitizers and Co(II/III) complexes as redox shuttles in liquid electrolytes.2 However, liquid electrolyte-based DSCs present a risk of leakage associated with the volatile nature of a liquid solvent, which significantly impedes this type of solar cell for large-scale commercial applications.3 In order to resolve this issue, solid-state p-type organic hole-transport materials (HTMs), such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD), were introduced as hole conductors to replace the liquid electrolyte in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (sDSC) by Bach et al. in 1998.4 Until now, a record efficiency of 7.7% has been reported by using the organic dye LEG4, characterized by a high molar extinction coefficient, as the absorber and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TeCA) doped Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM.5 However, the efficiencies of sDSCs are still far below the PCEs of liquid electrolyte-based DSCs. The main reason is that the active nanoporous TiO2 layer of a sDSC has been limited to less than 2.5 μm, resulting in incomplete light harvesting and consequently a low photocurrent of the device.6 Therefore, the development of novel photosensitizers with very high molar extinction coefficients and broad absorption spectra to enhance the light harvesting efficiency providing high PCEs in sDSCs is a main target for improvement. In spite of some efforts devoted to dye molecule designing for sDSCs, such as use of organic D–π–A dyes,7 indoline dyes8 and ullazine dyes,9 their photovoltaic performance is still not competitive. In particular, there are few cases of organic blue-colored dyes reported for sDSCs.10
In this work, two novel organic blue-colored dyes termed S4 and S5 (Scheme 1) with indeno[1,2-b]thiophene functionalized triphenylamine as the donor,11 2,3-diphenylpyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine (PP) or 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline (QT) as the auxiliary acceptor and cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) as the π-linker were designed and synthesized for sDSCs. One of the dyes, S5 containing the QT unit as the electron-withdrawing group exhibits a high molar extinction coefficient of 6.3 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 600 nm. Most importantly, the S5-based sDSCs show record PCEs of 7.81% and 8.25% under one sun and 0.5 sun light intensities, respectively, exceeding the PCE of LEG4-based solar cells (7.34%) and that of the S4 based devices (4.71%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case where an organic blue-colored dye displays a PCE over 7.8% in sDSCs. These results clearly show that molecular engineering is a viable way to develop blue-colored dyes with high molar extinction coefficients for use in highly efficient sDSCs. Also, blue-colored dyes open up co-sensitization strategies in combination with traditional organic dyes with yellow-red colours.

Results and discussion
Molecular design and synthesis
The design rationale was to prepare organic blue-colored dyes with high molar extinction coefficients and broad absorption spectra to enhance the light harvesting efficiency in sDSCs. Thus, indeno[1,2-b]thiophene functionalized triphenylamine with a strong electron-donating ability was introduced as the donor, and PP/QT units with a pronounced electron-withdrawing ability was used as the auxiliary acceptors in combination with a 2-ethylhexane-substituted CPDT unit as the π-system for the target dyes S4 and S5. The synthetic routes of S4 and S5 are depicted in Scheme 2. We note that the synthesis routes of S4 and S5 are similar with the only difference in the auxiliary acceptor unit. The synthetic routes start from a Stille coupling reaction of 5,8-dibromo-2,3-diphenylpyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine and 5,8-dibromo-2,3-diphenylquinoxaline with (4,4-bis(2-ethyl hexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′] dithiophen-2-yl)tributylstannane to obtain compounds 1a and 1b. In the next step, a Vilsmeier–Haack reaction of compounds 1a and 1b is employed, where N,N-dimethylformamide and phosphorus oxychloride afforded the important intermediates 2a and 2b, respectively. Afterwards, Stille coupling reactions of the compounds 2a and 2b with N-(2′,4′-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)-4,4-dimethyl-N-(2,2′′,4,4′′-tetrakis((2-ethyl hexyl)oxy)-[1,1′:3′,1′′-terphenyl]-4′-yl)-2-(trimethylstannyl)-4H-indeno[1,2-b]thiophen-6-amine resulted in aldehydes 3a and 3b, respectively. Finally, the target products S4 and S5 were synthesized by Knoevenagel condensation of the aldehydes 3a and 3b with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of acetic acid and ammonium acetate, respectively. All key intermediates and the two final sensitizers were fully characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy, and HR-MS spectrometry. 1H/13C NMR spectra and high resolution mass spectrometry results (HR-MS) are shown in Fig. S1–S8.† In addition, LEG4 and devices constructed with this dye were employed as a reference in this study.12

Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the sensitizers S4 and S5 in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) solution and on TiO2 films (2.2 μm) are shown in Fig. 1a and b, and the maximum absorption peaks as well as their molar extinction coefficients are listed in Table 1. The dyes S4 and S5 exhibit low-energy absorption maxima at 612 nm and 600 nm, respectively, which is 71 nm and 59 nm red-shifted as compared to the reference red dye LEG4 (541 nm). The dye S5 with the QT unit as the electron-withdrawing group exhibits a high molar extinction coefficient of 6.3 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 600 nm, which is higher than that of the dye LEG4 (4.9 × 104 M−1 cm−1), and much higher than that of the PP-based dye S4 (2.7 × 104 M−1 cm−1). This could be ascribed to the higher oscillator strength of S5 according to quantum-chemical calculations (Table 3).13 It was observed that the absorption maxima of S4, S5 and LEG4 are blue-shifted to 588 nm, 574 nm and 471 nm (Fig. 1b), respectively, when adsorbed onto 2.2 μm TiO2 films, and the absorption spectra of S4 and S5 are clearly broader than that of LEG4. These results indicate that the dye S5 possesses a stronger light-absorption capacity than LEG4 and S4 both in solution and on TiO2 films.

Electrochemical data and DTF simulation
In order to evaluate the feasibility of dye regeneration and electron injection for material combinations in sDSCs, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in CH2Cl2 solution (Fig. 1d) and the relevant data are listed in Table 1. The indeno[1,2-b]thiophene-functionalized triphenylamine donor-based dyes S4 and S5 show ground-state oxidation potentials (E0ox) of 0.80 V and 0.79 V, respectively, which are 80 mV and 90 mV more negative than that of the triphenylamine-donor-based dye LEG4 (0.88 V); all comparisons of oxidation/reduction potentials are made on the NHE scale. However, the E0ox values of S4 and S5 are still more positive than that of the HTM Spiro-OMeTAD (0.63 V vs. NHE)14 (Fig. 1c), which indicates that these blue dyes are likely to be effectively regenerated by the HTM Spiro-OMeTAD. On the other hand, the auxiliary acceptors PP and QT significantly decrease the excited-state oxidation potentials  of S4 and S5 to −0.96 V and −1.04 V, respectively, which are 210 mV and 130 mV more positive than that of the dye LEG4 (−1.17 V). Nevertheless, the  values of S4 and S5 are more positive than the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), which indicates that electrons from the excited state S4 or S5 dyes should be effectively injected into the CB of the TiO2 semiconductor substrate. Thus, the narrow band gap (E0–0) blue dyes S4 and S5 have the potential to work efficiently in Spiro-OMeTAD-based sDSCs.
Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations were employed to estimate the relative energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, as well as the maximum absorption wavelengths of the dyes S4 and S5 (Tables 2 and 3).15 The results show that the S0 → S1 vertical electronic transitions mainly originate from the HOMO to the LUMO while partly from the HOMO−1 to the LUMO and represent a characteristic intramolecular charge transfer perceived from the contour plots of the molecular orbitals. As for the spatial distribution of occupied orbitals, the HOMOs of S4 and S5 both are mainly located on the indeno[1,2-b]thiophene functionalized triphenylamine-based donor moieties, the HOMO−1 orbitals are delocalized over the whole molecule and the LUMOs are distributed on the auxiliary acceptor, the CPDT unit and the 2-cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group, enabling efficient intramolecular charge transfer with respect to TiO2. By replacing the PP unit with the QT unit, the HOMO of S5 shows more electron density on the auxiliary acceptor unit, thus possibly enabling more efficient charge transfer. In addition, the calculated HOMO energy level of S4 is more negative than that of S5, which is consistent with the experimental data.
In addition, a high molar extinction coefficient is very important in sDSCs in order to ensure a high light harvesting efficiency positively correlated with the oscillator strength (f) obtained from TDDFT calculation through the relation LHE = 1–10−f.16 For dye S5, a higher oscillator strength (4.47) relating to the absorption at 597 nm agrees well with the higher molar extinction coefficient observed for S5. This may be attributed to the larger orbital overlap between the HOMO (HOMO−1) and LUMO in S5 as compared to that in S4.
Photovoltaic performance
The current–voltage characteristic (J–V) curves of the champion solar cell-based on S4, S5 and LEG4 are shown in Fig. 2a, and the data are recorded in Table 4. The S5 dye-based devices yielded a high efficiency of 7.81% with a remarkable short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 12.91 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.83 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.73. These results are significantly higher than the 7.34% and 4.71% recorded for the LEG4- and S4-based devices under the same conditions. Moreover, the S5-based devices also showed a record PCE of 8.25% under 0.5 sun light intensity (Fig. 2b). To the best of our knowledge, the maximum values obtained represent record efficiencies under both one sun and 0.5 sun illumination for all Spiro-OMeTAD based sDSCs reported until now, and it is also the first case where devices based on a blue-colored dye show PCEs over 7.8%. In addition, S5 also exhibited notable efficiencies of 8.85% and 7.29% (Fig. S9 and Table S1†) in liquid DSCs based on Co(bpy)32+/3+ and I−/I3− as electrolyte redox systems, respectively. The corresponding devices based on the dye S4 showed PCEs of 4.44% and 5.04%, respectively. S5 showed much better device performance than the S4 in both liquid DSCs and sDSCs, which is mainly attributed to its high molar extinction coefficient allowing more efficient light harvesting. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices based on S4, S5 and the reference dye LEG4, as well as their integrated Jsc, are shown in Fig. 3c. Not surprisingly, the S4- and S5-based devices show much broader IPCE spectra than those based on the dye LEG4, even extending to the onset of the NIR region at 800 nm. However, the LEG4-based devices show higher maximum IPCEs, nearly up to 80%, than S5-based devices (65%); this may be ascribed to its larger dye loading (Table 4). The S4-based solar cells displayed low maximum IPCEs (approx. 40%) as compared to S5-based devices; which is again attributed to the dye's low molar extinction coefficient. The IPCE results are in good agreement with the corresponding UV-visible absorption spectra from TiO2 films (Fig. 1b). In addition, the same trend in IPCE in liquid DSCs was observed (Fig. S10†). In addition, the distribution and standard deviation of the solar-cell efficiencies based on the different dyes are shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen from the results, the average efficiency of the S5-based devices was 7.10%, which is higher than the efficiencies of the LEG4 (6.68%) and S4 (4.17%) based devices. This can be attributed to the high molar extinction coefficient and broad absorption spectra of dye S5, which can enhance the light harvesting efficiency in sDSCs.

 Fig. 3  Distribution and standard deviation of the sDSC device efficiencies based on different dyes (at least 16 devices were studied). 
In order to evaluate the interfacial charge recombination in the sDSCs, transient photovoltage decay measurements were carried out (Fig. 2d). The electron lifetime (τe) the devices increases in the order S4 < S5 < LEG4 consistent with the Voc trend. The long electron lifetime and thus the high open-circuit voltage of the devices based on the dye LEG4 could possibly be attributed to its smaller molecular size and as a consequence a larger dye loading; clearly, recombination loss reactions are retarded in such devices. As previously reported,17 high dye coverage could act as a blocking layer to retard electron recombination loss reactions between the injected TiO2 electrons and the electrolyte/hole conductors. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also performed to monitor the electron recombination in liquid DSCs,18 and the higher charge-transfer resistance and longer τe recorded are in accordance with the higher Voc of the S5-based liquid DSCs for both cobalt and iodine-based electrolytes (Fig. S11 and S12†).
Photoinduced absorption spectroscopy (PIA)
Photoinduced absorption spectroscopy (PIA) was carried out in order to evaluate the dye regeneration yield. The measured absorption change (ΔA) of the dye/TiO2 and dye/TiO2/Spiro-OMeTAD systems is displayed in Fig. 4. A negative ΔA signal was found in the region 500–600 nm for LEG4, while the signals of S4 and S5 are located in the region 600–700 nm. This can be attributed to the broader absorption of S4 and S5 in the ground state. A positive ΔA is mainly ascribed to the oxidized dye.19 The dye regeneration yield may be obtained by comparing the maximum ΔA of the TiO2/dye/Spiro-OMeTAD system (red) with that of the TiO2/dye (black) system. The ΔA of S5 dropped by nearly 90% after deposition of the hole-transport layer (Fig. 4b), which indicates that S5 is efficiently regenerated by Spiro-OMeTAD. This is in good agreement with the high Jsc value recorded for the S5-based sDSCs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized two novel organic blue-colored sensitizers named S4 and S5 for the application in sDSCs. The dye S5 exhibits a remarkably high molar extinction coefficient of 6.30 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 600 nm and as expected the devices based on this dye also show high PCEs of 7.81% and 8.25% under one sun and 0.5 sun light intensities, respectively. The PCEs of the S5-based sDSC devices exceed those of the commonly used red dye LEG4 (7.34%). In addition, transient photovoltage decay and photoinduced absorption spectroscopy of the corresponding sDSC liquid DSC devices offer important insights into the reasons for device performance. The present work shows for the first time that a blue-colored dye can offer PCEs close to 8% in sDSCs, which encourages further development of blue-colored dyes with high molar extinction coefficients for the application in sDSCs and also opens up new co-sensitization strategies in combination with traditional organic dyes.
