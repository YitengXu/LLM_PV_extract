    , Accepted 6th July 2011First published on 22nd August 2011AbstractNanowebs consisting of interwoven ZnFe2O4 nanofibers are synthesized by a simple electrospinning technique, to be employed as an environmentally friendly anode in lithium ion batteries. Effect of precursor viscosity on the growth mechanism of electrospun ZnFe2O4 nanofibers (ZFO-NF) and ZnFe2O4 nanorods (ZFO-NR) is studied by microscopy and diffraction techniques. Structural characterization by powder X-ray diffraction, FESEM and HRTEM studies evaluates the single phase nature of ZnFe2O4, which consists of 11(3) nm nanocrystals that self-agglomerate to form nanofibers after thermal treatment. FESEM micrographs depict the self-assembly of electrospun ZnFe2O4 nanofibers into intertwined porous nanowebs with a continuous framework. Benefitting from the one-dimensional functional nanostructured architecture, the application of electrospun nanowebs with ZnFe2O4 nanofiber (ZFO-NF) anodes in lithium ion batteries exhibits excellent cyclability and retains a reversible capacity of 733(10) mAh g−1 up to 30 cycles at 60 mA g−1 as compared to ZnFe2O4 nanorods (ZFO-NR) with a capacity of ∼200 mAh g−1. In addition, the importance of providing electronic wiring during lithiation/delithiation, especially in prolonged cycling, is emphasized.
Introduction
With surging oil prices and growing concern over global warming caused by excessive emission of gaseous by-products, electrical storage systems coupled with renewable energy sources are anticipated as the solution to limit the CO2 emission, as well as to reduce our total dependency on fossil fuels. Among various electrical energy storage solutions, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have been particularly popularized recently due to their versatile applications in mobile electronic devices, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), electric vehicles (EVs) and stationary storage systems of green energy produced by solar and wind power. Nevertheless, LIBs currently available in the market could not meet the high power/energy density and safety requirement for high volume future applications, so the development of lithium ion technology is now being stimulated towards this goal. Specialty graphite has been widely used as an anode since the first commercial lithium ion battery,1,2 as it is cheap and non-toxic. However, the intrinsically available intercalation hosts for lithium ions are limited, and thus the theoretical specific capacity of graphite is less 372 mAh g−1 (with LiC6 as an end compound with deep discharge versusLi/Li+).2 In addition, risk of lithium dendrite formation on graphite at a high discharge/charge rate may lead to battery explosion.3 These drawbacks have directed the research community to explore alternatives to graphite to realize safer LIBs with higher power/energy density.
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) have been recognized as one of the promising LIB anode substitutes, associated to their ability to store large numbers of lithium ions per formula unit by conversion reaction and consequently their high theoretical capacity (∼400–900 mAh g−1).4–6 Among the TMOs, cobalt oxides such as Co3O47–13 and CoO7 exhibit excellent capacity values in the range of 700–900 mAh g−1 with good cyclability. However, cobalt based oxides are not an ideal choice to replace graphite because of their high working voltage (∼2.1 V versusLi/Li+),8,12,14 cost and toxicity.11 Hence iron oxides with comparable capacity have received much attention.15–18 In spite of their lower cost and better safety, the capacity retention of Fe-based binary oxides remains a major drawback. This is due to the huge volumetric expansion/contraction during the charging/discharging process, ultimately leading to pulverization of the electrode from the current collector, resulting in loss of electrical contact.12 Furthermore, their electrochemical performance is highly dependent on their diverse morphologies.15,16,18–20TMO spinels (AB2O4) with two transition elements (both A- and B-sites) provide the feasibility to tune the energy density and working voltages by varying the transition metal content.21,22 Owing to it, zinc has been substituted into iron oxide to construct a ternary zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4), as it is green and possesses a lower working voltage (∼1.5 V) to effectively enhance the total output voltage by 0.6 V compared to cobalt oxides with respect to LiCoO2 as the cathode material.3,23–25 It is also interesting to note that ZnFe2O4 generates high capacity as lithium ions form an alloy with Zn and dealloy, while Fe and Zn react with Li2O to absorb/release Li during lithiation/delithiation. Thus, ZnFe2O4 implements both conversion7,26 and alloy/dealloy2,27 reaction, simultaneously. Until now, NuLiet al.25 reported an initial reversible capacity of 556 mAh g−1 in ZnFe2O4 thin film, but gradual capacity fading was observed at very low current density. Sharma et al.3 have reported ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles, while the rate capability of hollow ZnFe2O4 spheres has been studied by Guo and et al.23
Versatile techniques are currently available in research and industry to produce ferrites, as they are an important component in magnetic recording, microelectronic devices and biomedical applications.28 Since, the lithium storage characteristic of a material is highly dependent on its size, morphology and structure,29,30 nanoscaling of ferrites for anodes in LIBs has received an upsurge of interest. The kinetics of lithium ions are enhanced manifestly in nanostructured anodes due to shortened diffusion pathway and larger surface area, leading to high power and energy density.26,31,32 Generally, nanomaterials suffer limitations, including difficulty in synthesis, poor reproducibility, inhomogeneity and prohibitively high fabrication costs due to sophisticated fabrication techniques. Furthermore, nanomaterials have a great tendency to form agglomerates due to their high specific surface area and excessive surface energy.26,30,31 Herein, a relatively simple and cost effective electrospinning strategy has been employed to fabricate high aspect ratio one-dimensional (1D) ZnFe2O4 nanofibers.33,34Electrospinning involves uniaxial stretching of a viscoelastic solution by applying a strong electric field resulting in non-woven nanofiber layers or mats. Diverse fibrous arrays with tunable length and diameter at nano- or meso-levels, high surface area and controllable textures35 can be produced by simply varying the electrospinning parameters such as precursor viscosity, flow rate, applied electric field and distance between the syringe and collector. Eletrospun interconnected nanofiber electrodes may render good electrical conduction path and large accessible surface area, in order to facilitate lithium ion diffusion and increase the electrode/electrolyte contact area thus it may enhance the electrochemical properties.36
In this report, we demonstrate the electrochemical properties of electrospun nanowebs consisting of interwoven ZnFe2O4 nanofibers as lithium ion battery anodes. We also propose the formation mechanism with emphasis on the effect of precursor viscosity on the nanofiber morphology. Electrospun ZnFe2O4 nanowebs show no traces of agglomeration and successfully form a connective framework to facilitate the ions/electrons transfer and electrolyte penetration, which is favourable during lithium insertion and extraction. In addition we study the transition of the 1D ZnFe2O4 nanofibers to nanorods when altering the viscosity of the precursor solution. As compared to nanorods, a higher reversible capacity of 925 mAh g−1 and enhanced cyclability are achieved by electrospun ZnFe2O4 nanofibers, owing to the interconnected ZnFe2O4 nanowebs which effectively enhance ion flux and accommodate the lattice stress generated upon prolonged cycling. Hence, ZnFe2O4 nanowebs with interlocking nanofibers have a stable cycling performance, especially at high C rate (charging/discharging rate of a battery) making it a potential anode material in LIBs.
Results and discussion
Formation mechanism of electrospun ZnFe2O4 nanofibers (ZFO-NF) and nanorods (ZFO-NR)

Fig. 1(a) and (c) demonstrate the fibrous morphology of as-spun nanofibers at different poly(vinylpyrolidone) (PVP) polymer:metallic precursor weight ratio, in which continuous nanofibers with a smooth surface and uniform diameter are displayed in both cases. Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted (Fig. 2) on the as-spun nanofibers between 25 °C and 650 °C, in order to decide the sintering temperature. About 17 wt% of weight loss recorded in the range of 20–200 °C is attributed to absorbed moisture, water molecules from the metallic precursor, as well as the volatile solvent trapped inside the as-spun nanofibers, such as water, ethanol and acetic acid. The prominent peak at 255 °C corresponds to the decomposition of metallic precursor, namely iron nitrate, and zinc acetate, while a sudden incline at 343 °C relates to the removal of PVP. At temperatures higher than 400 °C, there is negligible weight loss observed, indicating the removal of the polymer (PVP) and hence sintering temperature of 450 °C was employed on the as-spun nanofibers. Thorough elimination of PVP is required to obtain the pure phase, to fulfil the purpose of investigating the electrochemical performance of ZnFe2O4 without organic impurities. After sintering, FESEM images of sintered products were taken (Fig. 1(b) and 1(d)) and apparently there is a diverse change in morphologies by altering the viscosity level of the electrospinning precursor solution.

            FESEM images of as-spun (a,c) and sintered (b,d) nanofibers. By reducing the weight ratio of PVP polymer: metallic precursor from (a,b) 5.04:1 (ZFO-NR) to (c,d) 3.93:1 (ZFO-NF), the diameters of the as-spun fibers shrink significantly, as well as the length of these sintered products retains longer.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of as-spun ZnFe2O4 nanofibers was conducted between room temperature and 650 °C in air. 

FTIR spectra analysis in Fig. 3 further proves the absence of PVP in ZFO-NF after sintering by looking into the molecular structural changes. As compared to the sintered ZnFe2O4, several uncommon bands are observed in the PVP precursor (Fig. 3(a)) and as-spun nanofibers (Fig. 3(b)). A broad band centered at 3437 cm−1 can be interpreted as O–H vibrations due to the presence of adsorbed moisture, ethanol solvent or acetic acid. Another noticeable peak at 2927 cm−1 is attributed to the symmetric stretching of C–H groups,37,38 relating to the presence of PVP. The adjacent peaks in between 700 and 2000 cm−1 correspond to the bending and stretching frequencies of PVP functional groups. Band at 1662 cm−1 is attributed to either C–N or CO functional groups. CH2 scissoring and wagging are presented at 1452 cm−1 and 1267 cm−1 respectively.39 The as-spun nanofibers possess similar but weakened peaks than PVP, while a new intense band appears at 1385 cm−1 indicating the existence of trapped ethanol solvent.37 After the sintering at 450 °C, all the peaks assigned to PVP and ethanol solvent disappeared, whereas a new peak located at high frequency bands (546 cm−1) formed. This may be due to the stretching vibrations between the oxygen atoms and the cations in either octahedral or tetrahedral positions,40 thus indicating sintering at 450 °C of as-spun nanofibers resulting in the simultaneous removal of PVP and crystallization of ZnFe2O4 nanocrystallites. The XRD pattern shown in Fig. 4 confirms the formation of the single-phase cubic spinel structure (Fd3m) of ZnFe2O4. The peaks at 2θ = 18.17°, 29.95°, 35.28°, 36.88°, 46.92°, 53.09°, 56.66°, 62.17°, 70.48°, 73.46° and 89.01° correspond to (hkl) = (111), (220), (311), (222), (331), (422), (511), (440), (620), (533) and (553) Miller indices respectively. The lattice parameter of ZnFe2O4 obtained by Rietveld refinement is 8.441(7) Å, which is in good agreement with 8.440(5) Å (ICSD no. 24496). Elemental composition analysis of ZFO-NF and ZFO-NR obtained from energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) corroborate the XRD studies (see supporting information Fig. S1†).

HRTEM
          micrographs and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were taken with the purpose of evaluating the nano-phase nature of the sintered ZnFe2O4 nanowebs. The bright field TEM image (Fig. 5(a)) reveals the secondary microstructure of sintered nanofibers: it is primarily composed of nanocrystals with a crystallite size of 11(3) nm, which is coherent with the observation in Rietveld refinement. After sintering, nanocrystallites self-assemble to form a nanoparticulate interconnected fibrous morphology. SAED pattern of the nanofibers (Fig. 5(b)) demonstrating that they are polycrystalline with the d-spacing consistent with XRD results. Therefore, nanophase and well-crystalline ZnFe2O4 was successfully formed by the electrospinning method. The high resolution transmission electron micrograph (HRTEM) was taken along the [101] zone axis with d200 (0.42 nm) and d1 (0.49 nm) (Fig. 5(c)), while the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) is shown in the inset of Fig. 5(c). The simulated HRTEM pattern in Fig. 5(d) depicts the thickness of the ZnFe2O4 nanocrystals to be ∼5 nm. With three dimensions of crystals in the nano-level, the ionic conductivity and diffusion coefficient of lithium ions are enhanced significantly in accordance with the shortened diffusion path;41,42 these studies will be discussed in next section (Evidence of inter-beneficial conversion reaction and alloy-dealloy mechanism).

To date, it has been reported that the morphology of resultant nanofibers is critically influenced by the viscosity of the precursor solution. Macías et al.43 reported that longer and thinner electrospun metallic oxide fibers could be obtained by increasing the viscosity of the precursor solution. It is worthy of note that, in the present investigation, a different phenomenon was discovered. By reducing the weight ratio of PVP polymer over the metallic precursor from 5.04:1 (ZFO-NR) to 3.93:1 (ZFO-NF), a steady decrease of the viscosity from 125(3) cP to 101(3) cP was observed, while the diameter of the as-spun nanofibers shrinks evidently from 168(40) nm to 90(20) nm, respectively. Most interestingly, the fibrous structure of as-spun nanofibers with a weight ratio of 5.04:1 collapses after the selective removal of PVP at 450 °C, and turns into nanorods (ZFO-NR). By contrast, the fibrous structure of as-spun nanofibers with a weight ratio of 3.93:1 is remarkably retained with the length of up to several micrometres (ZFO-NF). A difference in aspect ratio in ZFO-NR and ZFO-NF directly indicates the effect of viscosity on the length of the sintered fiber. So, longer and more consistent nanofibers can be obtained if the viscosity of the precursor solution is reduced, and vice versa for nanorods. The diameter of sintered products falls in a range of ∼50–100 nm, and the BET surface area was found to be 40–60 m2 g−1.

          Sintering of the electrospun nanofiber not only removes the polymeric PVP precursor backbone but also crystallizes the ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles. We propose the formation mechanism of electrospun ZnFe2O4 nanowebs in which partially crystallized individual ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles form the building blocks that self-assemble and inter-grow into a continuous fibrous morphology after the removal of PVP and volatile species at 450 °C. If the weight ratio of PVP in the electrospinning solution is higher than the metal ions (higher viscosity) (Scheme 1), the fibers break into several segments of shorter nanorods (ZFO-NR) due to the drastic structural changes when the PVP backbone is heated away. On the other hand, reducing the amount of PVP (lower viscosity), results in closer dispersion of the individual ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles that tend to self-aggregate to construct long continuous fibers (ZFO-NF) upon sintering. Fig. 1(c) and 1(d) show the optimal viscosity to obtain an ideal morphology for the nanofibers, with a coherent length of several micrometres and diameter in nano-dimensions. When the electrospinning duration is increased, continuous nanofibers gradually overlay to form interlocking nanowebs with opened pores existing in between the nanofibers. Stacking of the nanowebs is essential in electrochemical measurement to provide mechanical integrity during lithiation/delithiation. This functional nanostructure is obtained with the appropriate level of viscosity and thus we conclude that the diameter is reduced and the length is elongated as a smaller PVP proportion is used. In present study, we discuss only the effect of viscosity on the electrospun nanofibers. Nevertheless, the sintering temperature can also influence the morphology of the electrospun nanofibers.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of electrospinning of ZnFe2O4 nanofibers. (a) The inset shows magnified details of the as-spun fibers which consist of PVP as the polymer agent and dispersed ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles. (b) Mechanism of the formation of ZnFe2O4 electrospun nanofibers has been proposed. If the viscosity of the solution is higher (PVP:M = 5.04:1, M: metallic precursor), it carries fewer ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles, so the as-spun fibers are broken and become nanorods (ZFO-NR) after the removal of PVP. By contrast, when PVP:M is reduced to 3.93:1, higher amounts of ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles are encapsulated in the PVP solution, and continuously long nanofibers are obtained after the thermal treatment (ZFO-NF). 
Evidence of inter-beneficial conversion reaction and alloy–dealloy mechanism
The electrochemical performance of ZnFe2O4 nanowebs (sample ZFO-NF and ZFO-NR) was first examined by galvanostatic discharge/charge cycling between 0.005 and 3.0 V at the current density of 60 mA g−1. The discharge/charge behavior of ZnFe2O4 nanowebs at the 1st, 2nd and 5th cycles was studied (see Fig. 6 and Supporting Information, Fig. S2†). For sample ZFO-NF (Fig. 6), the first discharge represents the lithium insertion, commencing from OCV ∼2.5 V and proceeds to a deep discharge, 0.005 V. In the beginning of the first discharge, two small plateaus are shown at ∼1.4 V and ∼0.95 V (Fig. 6(b)), which is observed by cyclic voltammetry (CV, Fig. 7). The corresponding capacities of 22 mAh g−1 and ∼170(5) mAh g−1 correlate to the consumption of ∼0.2 and ∼1.5 mol of Li per mol of ZnFe2O4, respectively. It is worth mentioning that these two plateaus were not reported in either the micro-level thin film25 or nanoparticles of 100–300 nm3. Moreover, there were evidently no plateaus observed at ∼1.4 V and ∼0.95 V in nanorods too (see Supporting Information, Fig. S2†), which suggests that the lithium reactivity and storage behaviour are highly contingent upon the properties of the host materials, such as particle size, morphology and structure architecture.29,30 Gaining benefit from nanowebs with one-dimensional functional integrated ZnFe2O4 nanofibers, ∼1.7 mol of Li is absorbed by the ZnFe2O4 spinel phase upon intercalation. This is well supported by ex situXRD at different potential levels (Fig. 8). The peaks expressed in the XRD pattern of the raw electrode show qualitative resemblance to the electrodes discharged to 1.3 V and 0.9 V, suggesting that no structural variation has yet initiated and thus the associated capacity of ∼192(5) mAh g−1 is only ascribed to the intercalation of lithium into the ZnFe2O4 nanowebs. A similar mechanism was also observed for the sample ZFO-NR (Supporting Information, Fig. S2†), but a lower capacity retention was recorded. The reason will be discussed in the next section (Electrochemical stability in ZFO-NR and ZFO-NF).

XRD pattern of raw ZnFe2O4 electrode (ZFO-NF), and electrodes discharged to 1.3 V, 0.9 V, 0.005 V respectively. 
No XRD peak related to the spinel structure is found when the electrode undergoes deep discharge to 0.005 V. So, a vivid peak at 0.8 V in CV (Fig. 7) and a large plateau at also 0.8 V in galvanostatic cycling (Fig. 6) could be speculated as the potential when the crystal structure destruction or amorphization takes place, and thus the first discharge trend is notably distinguished from other discharge cycles (Fig. 6(a)) due to the reduction of ZnFe2O4 into Li2O, Fe and Zn. This hypothesis is supported by Sharma et al.3 in which the destruction occurred at ∼0.85 V, while Selvan et al.24 pointed to the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(0) at 0.8 V. A very shallow but discernable peak at ∼0.4 V was examined by CV (Fig. 7) as the reduction of Zn(II) to Zn(0),44 followed by another cathodic peak at very low potential, ∼0.1 V; this was previously observed by Wang et al.27 as the formation of a Li–Zn alloy. Based on this observation, we believe that the destruction in ZnFe2O4 occurred at the reduction potential of Fe(III) to Fe(0), which is in agreement with earlier work on the AB2O4 system with two transition metals (A and B),6 wherein only a single plateau instead of two is observed. This feature preliminarily indicates that the main cathodic peak is strongly influenced by the working voltage of element B, owing to its higher stoichiometric ratio (A:B = 1:2) in the mixed element system, thus enabling tuning of the working voltage. However, further research is required to confirm this point.
Overall, the first discharge capacity of 1292(10) mAh g−1 (∼11.63 mol of Li) is delivered by the ZnFe2O4 nanofibers from 3–0.005 V by three following processes: (1) intercalation, (2) conversion reaction and (3) alloy reaction of Li and Zn. It is worth noticing that the first discharge capacity is well above the predicted theoretical capacity, which corresponds to 9 Li ion per formula. The additional capacity is attributed to the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation due to the nanophase nature and polymeric layer formation on the Fe(0) nanoparticles.14,19
The first charge curve (Fig. 6) illustrates the lithium extraction, in which a smoothly increasing curve is obtained till ∼1.35 V, and followed by a plateau at ∼1.5 V; simultaneously an oxidation peak at ∼1.5 V is also seen in CV. Total reversible capacity after first charge is found to be 925(10) mAh g−1 (∼8.3 mol of Li), which is higher than 778 mAh g−1 (considered as FeO formation upon charging). But it is lower than 1000 mAh g−1 (Fe2O3 formation), so it reveals the formation of a mixed matrix containing Fe(II)O and Fe(III)2O3. This finding is analogous to the study done by Morales et al.19Ex situHRTEM (Fig. 9) was employed to verify the phase formation, and the diffuse set of concentric rings indicates the charged electrode consisting of nanocrystalline regions dispersed in an amorphous matrix. The d-spacings and their respective Miller indices were retrieved from the SAED data (Table 1). It was found that a mixed phase of ZnO, LiZn, FeO and Fe2O3 coexists in a charged state. The HRTEM micrograph (inset of Fig. 9) of ZFO-NF after 50 discharge/charge cycles reveals that the nanofibrous morphology was retained after prolonged cycling, indicating the good reversibility of ZnFe2O4 through both conversion reaction and alloy–dealloy mechanism.
 Fig. 9  (Inset) Ex situHRTEM image shows that the ZnFe2O4 nanofibers maintain their mechanical integrity even after 50 cycles. The corresponding SAED pattern displays a diffuse set of concentric rings, indicating the nanocrystalline nature of the charged electrode.

Furthermore, the average working voltage of the ZnFe2O4 nanowebs is ∼1.5 V, which is much lower than Co-based anodes (∼2.1 V),8,12,14Fe2O3 nanotube arrays (∼1.74 V)45 and Fe2O3 nanoflakes (∼2.1 V);17 consequently, ferrites with a spinel structure have the potential to enhance the total output voltage of LIBs with respect of LiCoO2 as cathode materials.
Electrochemical stability in ZFO-NR and ZFO-NF
Reversible capacity is one of the most crucial considering factors to choose an anode for LIBs, as mentioned in the beginning of this report; however, capacity fading has been inevitable in all previous studies of Fe-based oxides,19,25 but ZnFe2O4 nanowebs have effectively reduced the capacity loss.24,25,46Fig. 10 presents the cycling behavior of electrospun ZnFe2O4 nanowebs at 60 mA g−1. It is noticeable that electrospun ZnFe2O4 nanowebs release the first charge capacity of 925(10) mAh g−1, which is comparably higher than nanoparticles prepared by urea combustion, as well as thin films by reactive pulsed laser deposition.3,25 The observed capacity depletes slowly for the first few cycles and eventually retains a stable capacity of 733(10) mAh g−1 up to 30 cycles, which is almost two times higher than the reversible capacity given by commercial graphite. The coulombic efficiency remains higher than 95% and even slightly increases as the cycling proceeds.

Fig. 10(b) explains the dependency of cyclability on the nature of the materials. Sample ZFO-NR with shorter length is concurrently discharged/charged at 60 mAh g−1. Although the capacities of the first cycle are comparable with ZFO-NF, the retention of ZFO-NR is extremely poor at successive cycles, and only ∼200 mAh g−1 capacities remain after 30 cycles. The prominent contrast in terms of the capacity values obtained is due to the presence of an interconnected electronic and ionic conduction pathway in ZFO-NF, where the interwoven nanowebs not only offer a larger electrolyte/electrode effective contact surface, but also an easier and facile lithium ion diffusion.
The rate capability of ZnFe2O4 nanowebs (ZFO-NF) was also examined by galvanostatic cycling at different current densities for 55 cycles (Fig. 10(c)). A high capacity of ∼400 mAh g−1 is seen at 800 mA g−1 (∼1C). The enhanced capacity releases at higher current densities has explained the importance of having a well-connected electronic wiring during lithium insertion/extraction. To correlate the morphology (especially the length) of the ZnFe2O4 nanowebs with the cycling performance, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out. The impedance spectra (Fig. 11(a)) consist of a semicircle in the high to medium frequency region, 100 kHz–10Hz and an inclined line in the low frequency range, 10Hz–0.1Hz. The high frequency semicircles are ascribed to the surface film formation which may also affect the charge transfer phenomenon. In addition, the variation in the diameter of semicircle indicates that there is one more phenomenon which might be very much responsible for the distinct impedance behaviour. That may be the inter-particle impedance which is lowest in the long nanofibers (ZFO-NF). This value might be relatively higher in the nanorods (ZFO-NR). To quantify the experimental impedance values, a theoretical circuit consisting of resistance, capacitance, and Warburg impedance was predicted (Fig. 11(b)). The impedance values and the shape of curves show that ZFO-NF exhibits a lower value of Rsf of 120(5) Ω, as compared to 226(5) Ω in ZFO-NR. The thicker polymeric film formed by decomposition of the organic electrolyte in ZFO-NR may prevent the efficient charge transfer and lithium ion-diffusion process as well to/or from electrolyte/electrode and vice versa. This leads to worse lithium cyclability behavior as shown in Fig. 10(b). Furthermore, the slope of the inclined line is more prominent for ZFO-NR which indicates a high Warburg region which may be one of the causes of the drastic capacity fading. To elucidate the clear variation in impedance values and its effect on the lithium cyclability process, detailed EIS studies are provided and the fitted values are tabulated in Table 2. The analysis has proven the importance of maintaining interconnecting nanowebs with high aspect ratio nanofibers.

Conclusions

        ZnFe2O4 nanowebs with interlocking long and high quality nanofibers were prepared by a relatively cost effective and simple electrospinning method. By adjusting the viscosity of the precursor solution, we could tune the length of the sintered products to be either nanorods (ZFO-NR) or nanofibers (ZFO-NF). On the basis of high aspect ratio long fibrous morphology, ZFO-NF demonstrated better cyclability and rate capability than ZFO-NR, as a potential alternative to graphite anodes. The enhanced electrochemical performance of ZFO-NF may be attributed to the continuous framework with opened pores for lithiation/delithiation in nanowebs. This study is believed to be useful not only for understanding the effect of viscosity on electrospun nanofibers, but also the importance of providing electronic wiring in LIBs especially during prolonged cycling.
Experimental section
The ZnFe2O4 nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning technique. All chemical reagents were used as received without any purification. Firstly, poly(vinylpyrolidone) (PVP; Fluka) of molecular weight 360000 was dissolved in absolute ethanol (Sigma Aldrich) to form a 15 wt% solution. Stoichiometric amounts of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (Sigma Aldrich) and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Sigma Aldrich) were mixed in 2 ml of deionised water and 0.5 ml of acetic acid (Tedia) with vigorous stirring. After the mixture was stirred for 0.5 h, appropriate amount of PVP/ethanol solution was added and vigorously stirred for 24 h at room temperature to obtain a homogenous solution. Two different precursor solutions were prepared with varying weight ratio of PVP versus metallic precursor (denoted as M), to study the effects of viscosity on the fibrous morphology. To have a fair comparison, weight of metallic precursors was kept constant. Samples were denoted as ZFO-NF with PVP:M = 3.93:1 and ZFO-NR with PVP:M = 5.04:1.
The precursor solution was loaded into a 5 ml syringe with a 25-gauge injection needle, which was connected to a high voltage power supply (Gamma High Voltage Research DC Power Supply). A positive voltage of 18 kV was applied between the needle tip and grounded aluminium foil collector with a distance of 14 cm. The solution was ejected at a constant flow rate of 1 ml hr−1 by syringe pump (Kd Scientific). The as-spun fibers were heated in ambient atmosphere at 450 °C for 2 h. The ramp rate was maintained at 0.5 °C min−1. ZnFe2O4 nanowebs obtained were dark brown in colour and were kept in a dry box before further characterization.
The viscosity of the electrospinning solution was measured by using a rotational automated rheometer (Anton Paar, Physical MCR 501) at 298 K, for shear rate between 2 and 100 s−1. Rotating plates with a diameter of 49.914 mm (CP50-1/TG) was chosen. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed by using TA Instrument Q500 to understand the thermal decomposition behaviour of the as-spun nanofibers. As-spun nanofiber was heated up from room temperature to 650 °C under air at a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained for the samples in KBr tablets using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum GX instrument at a resolution of 1 cm−1. Simultaneously, the surface area of ZnFe2O4 was recorded using Brunauer Emmett and Teller (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020) by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K. Before the analysis, the powder was degassed at 240 °C for 4 h.
The structural information was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 Advance, Cu-Kα radiation, λ = 0.15418 nm) with a step size of 0.009° over 10° to 90° 2θ range. The lattice parameter was evaluated by TOPAS Rietveld Refinement. The morphology of the samples was examined by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL 7600F) at 5 kV. HRTEM images were collected using JEOL 2100F microscope operated at 200kV and fitted with a low-background Gatan double tilt holder. High resolution images were acquired using a high-contrast objective aperture of 20 μm. Simulated images were calculated by the multislice method implemented in JEMS47 and the structure model obtained by XRD refinement used as input.
The electrochemical performances of ZnFe2O4 nanofibers were evaluated in a 2016-coin cell. The electrodes were prepared by mixing 60 wt% of active materials, 20 wt% of binder (Kynar) and 20 wt% of Super P Li (Timcal) in N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP, Sigma Aldrich) to form a homogenous slurry. The slurry was coated on etched copper foil by doctor blade (thickness ∼20–25 μm) and dried at 80 °C in air oven for 12 h. Subsequently, the coating was pressed between twin rollers to enhance the adhesion between copper foil and active materials. The electrodes were cut into circular disks with the diameter of 16 mm, each disk contained around 2 mg of active material's mass. The coin cells were assembled in an argon filled glovebox (MBraun, Germany) with oxygen and water content less than 1 ppm. Lithium metal was served as a counter electrode, Celgard 2400 as the separator and the electrolyte used was 1 M solution of LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate/diethylene carbonate (EC:DEC = 1:1, Charslton Technologies Pte Ltd.). Herein, we employed ZnFe2O4 as the active material.
The lithium storage properties of ZnFe2O4 nanofibers were examined by galvanostatic cycling (Multichannel Battery Tester, Neware Technology Limited) and cyclic voltammetry (CV, Solartron 1470E) measurements. These coin cells were galvanostatically charged and discharged in the voltage window of 0.005–3.000 V at room temperature at different current densities. CV testing was studied in the similar voltage range at a constant scanning rate of 0.01 mV s−1. In order to understand the structural variation after the galvanostatic cycling, the electrode material was peeled off from the current collector, and rinsed with DEC in a glovebox before being investigated by ex situXRD and HRTEM. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out on the coin cells consisting of a ZnFe2O4 electrode to correlate the effect of fibrous morphology (especially length) and the electrochemical performance of the ZnFe2O4 nanofibers. The data for both samples (ZFO-NR and ZFO-NF) were recorded in the range of 100 kHz–0.1Hz by applying the bias voltage of 10 mV, and the data were shown as a Nyquist plot (Z′, real part on x-axis and −Z′′, imaginary part on y-axis).

(a) The inset shows magnified details of the as-spun fibers which consist of PVP as the polymer agent and dispersed ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles. (b) Mechanism of the formation of ZnFe2O4 electrospun nanofibers has been proposed. If the viscosity of the solution is higher (PVP:M = 5.04:1, M: metallic precursor), it carries fewer ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles, so the as-spun fibers are broken and become nanorods (ZFO-NR) after the removal of PVP. By contrast, when PVP:M is reduced to 3.93:1, higher amounts of ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles are encapsulated in the PVP solution, and continuously long nanofibers are obtained after the thermal treatment (ZFO-NF).
