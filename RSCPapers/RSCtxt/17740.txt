    , Accepted 5th December 2012First published on 7th December 2012AbstractThis study demonstrates a novel light-emitting conjugated polymer (PCFOz) used to initiate excitation and propagation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in silver nanowires. Excitons in the polymer optically excited in close proximity to silver nanowires directly couple to the guided SPPs, and then propagate towards the wires' ends and light up. A tunable exciton–plasmon coupling is realized by varying the distance between PCFOz and Ag nanowires. Strongly efficient excitation of SPPs appears in the case of a spacer thickness of ∼10 nm. Moreover, photobleaching of the organic system is dramatically suppressed by separating the emitter and metal with a spacer, allowing at least 20 times improvement of photostability with a spacer thickness of 25 nm. Spectral dependence of exciton–plasmon coupling indicates that the nanowires' tips contain larger amount of red components. Study of emission decay dynamics demonstrates that the emission properties of PCFOz have been significantly modified by the proximity of Ag nanowires, generating more than 9-fold enhancement of PCFOz spontaneous emission. These results are believed to be important for the development of thin-film photonic–plasmonic waveguides, single photon source and various nanoscale fluorescence sensors.
Introduction
Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) represent collective electronic excitations evanescently confined along the interface between conductive and dielectric materials. The principle has served as the basis of a wide range of applications, such as waveguides,1–4 metamaterials,5,6 holography,7 plasmonic lasers,8 ultrahigh sensitivity biosensing,9 and solar cells.10 Similar to nanoscale optical fiber, plasmonic waveguides play an important role in light transmission in SPPs-based photonic circuitry. Among the available plasmonic waveguides, chemically synthesized silver nanowires have unique properties that make them particularly attractive, such as low propagating loss due to their smooth surface and scattering of plasmons to photons only at their sharp ends.11–14 However, the optically excited SPPs in Ag nanowires are facing a challenge, i.e. the dispersion relation of SPPs mismatches that of incident photons. Several strategies have been proposed to bridge this gap and launch propagating SPPs in Ag nanowires by means of (i) far-field excitation methods including total internal reflection,15 butt-coupling technique,16 focusing a laser on the wires' terminations,11,12 nanoparticle-mediated coupling17 and polymer waveguide interconnection,18 or (ii) near-field excitation like interaction with excitons from quantum dots,2,19–21 semiconductor nanoribbons3 and organic dyes.22 Compared with far-field excitation, near-field excitation does not require specific matching as the optical dipolar near-field contains a large amount of momentum components matching those of SPPs.23
It is worth noting that the inhomogeneous optical dipolar near-field, induced by, say the blinking effect of QDs or self-quenching of the organic dyes the in solid state, may produce undesired side-effects to the propagating modes in plasmonic waveguides.14,18,24,25 Light-emitting conjugated polymers, due to their “soft nature”, can be easily fabricated into homogeneous and continuous thin films via solution-based processing, and thus may be used as ideal near-field light source to excite nanowire SPPs. Accordingly, flexible, large-area and low-cost photoelectric devices with facile tunability of electronic, optical and mechanical properties would be derived from conjugated polymers. The hybridization of conjugated organic systems with nanoscale metals have led to a renewed interest in conjugated polymer, making the scope of their possible technological applications dramatically enlarged.26–30
Thus there are some major scientific problems to be solved for the development of flexible plasmonics-based photonic circuits, including: (1) how to generate effective SPPs through a conjugated polymer–Ag system; (2) how to tune the excitation efficiency in a practical way; and (3) how to design flexible plasmonic waveguide with high coupling efficiency, long propagation length as well as low ohmic losses.
The present work attempts to excite and control SPPs in conjugated polymer–metal nanowire coupling system. Light-emitting conjugated polymer (N-octylcarbazole-9,9′-dioctylfluorene-1,3,4-oxadiazole copolymer, PCFOz) is employed, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time to provide homogeneous substrate and optical dipolar near-field for initiating the nanowire's SPPs under wide-field illumination.
In principle, for a conjugated polymer molecule in proximity to a single silver nanowire, three possible channels of energy relaxation (I, II and III) should be considered (Fig. 1): direct emission into free-space (Channel I), non-radiative damping owing to ohmic loss in the metal (Channel II), and excitation of propagating SPPs along the wire followed by scattering at two end-facets (Channel III). Here we plan to effect exciton–SPPs conversion in such a system by controlling the distance between conjugated polymer molecules and Ag nanowires. The spectral dependence of excitation of SPPs and their propagation will be briefly discussed to estimate the loss in Ag nanowire waveguide. In order to demonstrate the multi-channel energy relaxation of the coupled system, emission dynamics of the conjugated polymer–Ag nanowire system will be investigated. It is hoped that outcomes of this work may provide a new way to design flexible plasmonic waveguide with high coupling efficiency, long propagation length and low ohmic losses, as well as to develop novel photonic circuits and nanophotonic sensors.

Experimental
Synthesis
The light-emitting conjugated polymer (N-octylcarbazole-co-9,9′-dioctylfluorene-co-1,3,4-oxadiazole copolymer, PCFOz) were synthesized via Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira reaction under refluxing condition in the mixture of 3,6-dibromo-9-octylcarbazole, 2,5-bis-(4-bromo-phenyl)-[1,3,4]-oxadiazole and 2,7-diethyne-9,9′-dioctylfluorene (molar ratio = 0.56 mmol:0.97 mmol:1.45 mmol) with Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 and CuI as the catalyst, followed by trimethylamine treatment. The copolymer was purified by chromatography using silica support, and the molecular structure was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3), δ ppm (mult., integr.): 8.22–8.09 (t, 3H), 8.06–7.96 (d, 6H), 7.81–7.61 (t, 8H), 7.61–7.42 (m, 7H), 3.55 (s, 11H), 2.01 (s, 10H), 1.41–0.48 (m, 50H). Number-average molecular weight (Mn) and the molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) analysis are 1.5 × 105 g mol−1 and 1.36, respectively.
Silver nanowires have been synthesized using the solution-phase polyol method without any modifications. The synthesis details can be found in the ESI.†
Substrate fabrication
Samples were prepared by spin-coating a toluene solution of the conjugated polymer PCFOz (0.5 mg ml−1) onto a piece of glass slide at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Thirty minutes later, PVA (0.1, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75 and 2.0 wt% in de-ionized water) was spun on the top at 3000 rpm for 60 s. The hydrophobic PCFOz was unperturbed during the spin-coating process because it did not dissolve in either water or alcohol. Finally, the dispersion of Ag nanowires in ethanol was spun on the top at 800 rpm for 60 s.
Characterization
High resolution microscopy measurements were performed using a JEM-2010HR transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with an operating voltage of 120 kV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on a Hitachi S-4800 operated at 5 kV. Extinction spectra were collected by means of a Lambda 750 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded by a FLS920-Combined Time Resolved & Steady State Fluorescence Spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments) using the 350 nm line of an Xe lamp as the excitation source and R1527 photomultiplier tube as the detector. The time-dependent measurements were conducted using the time-correlated single photon counting technique and a LifeSpec II luminescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, Ltd). Emission dynamics of the sample on a coverslip, excited by picosecond diode laser pulses, were measured using Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) at 445 nm and 590 nm, respectively. The pulse width, wavelength, and repetition rate were chosen as 100 ps, 405 nm, and 5 MHz, respectively.
Microscopes featuring an inverted-style frame were primarily set for Ag nanowires imaging and capable of producing fluorescence illumination through an episcopic and optical pathway. Fluorescence illumination from the mercury-arc (HBO lamp) passed through a collector lens and went into a cube that contained a set of interference filters including a dichroic mirror, barrier filter, and excitation filter. Light reflected from the dichroic mirror was restricted in wavelength by the excitation filter and focused on the sample by a 63× oil objective (NA = 1.4). Secondary fluorescence, emitted by the specimen, returned through the objective, dichroic mirror and barrier filter before being routed through the microscope optical train to camera port. The summarized fluorescence filters are provided in the ESI.† The samples were deposited on a coverslip and immersed in index matched oil n = 1.518 during the measurement. Images were collected with either a CCD detector (Hitachi, 8 bit, 480 × 640) or a high-speed CMOS (Photron FastCam 1024-PCI) camera.
Results and discussion
The conjugated polymer–Ag nanowire composite samples were created by spin-coating the polymer onto a piece of glass substrate, covered by a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) layer with different thicknesses to control the distance between PCFOz and Ag nanowires, and depositing Ag nanowires on the top of PVA (Fig. 2(a)). PCFOz is a derivative of polyfluorene. The continuous thin film of PCFOz with low surface roughness (<1 nm, see Fig. 2(b)) would provide a homogeneous optical dipolar near-field to efficiently excite nanowire SPPs. Because the conjugated polymer does not dissolve in water (the solvent of PVA), it would not be disturbed during the spin-coating process. Ag nanowires were synthesized by the alcohol-thermal approach (refer to the ESI for more details†).

The inset shows a SEM image of Ag nanowires. (d) SAED pattern of Ag nanowire. (e) HRTEM image showing the structure at the end of a Ag nanowire. 
TEM and SEM images (Fig. 2(c)) reveal the pentagonal profile of cross-section of the Ag nanowires with an average diameter of 162 ± 54 nm (ESI†). Electric diffraction analysis further indicates that the reflection assignments (Fig. 2(d)) well agree with the results reported previously.31 It can thus be concluded that the Ag nanowires have a cyclic penta-twinned fcc structure bounded by five {100} side planes and capped by five {111} planes with [110] growth direction. In fact, the HRTEM image of the area in close proximity to the distal end of the nanowire, as shown in Fig. 2(e), gives direct evidence for the cyclic penta-twinned structure of the nanowires. It is expected that such highly ordered crystalline structure of Ag nanowires would achieve a larger surface plasmon propagation length and lower loss as compared with polycrystalline versions.32
The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 3(a). Fluorescence illumination from the mercury-arc (HBO lamp) is used for wide field excitation of the samples. For imaging, four sets of fluorescence filters (labeled as DAPI, CFP, GFP and Rhod-like, respectively) with spectral widths of 445 ± 50, 480 ± 40, 525 ± 50 and 608 ± 65 nm are applied for recording emission from the samples (refer to the Experimental section and ESI for more details†). Fig. 3(b) shows a bright field image of an Ag nanowire to locate the nanowire. When the incident light shines on Ag nanowire only, the latter emits extremely weak light (Fig. 3(c)), suggesting that SPPs cannot be excited due to mismatch of dispersion relation between SPPs and photons. In contrast, the propagating SPPs can be successfully excited in the case of conjugated polymer–Ag nanowire system, as illustrated by the much brighter tips of the nanowire (Fig. 3(d)) and the pronounced intensity maxima at the nanowire ends (Fig. 3(e)). Furthermore, the fluorescence intensity of the middle part of nanowire is rather homogeneous, meaning that little SPPs out-coupling occurs during propagation due to the smooth surface of the Ag nanowire.

For the purpose of optimizing the exciton–SPPs coupling efficiency of the photonic–plasmonic device, it is desirable to control the distance between the PCFOz molecules and Ag nanowires. Accordingly, the thickness of PVA was systematically varied from 3 to 125 nm. Fig. 4(a) shows fluorescent microscopy images of PCFOz–PVA–Ag nanowire composite with different thicknesses of PVA using a 445 ± 50 nm emission band-pass filter (DAPI-like). Pronounced light scattered from the distal wire end can be observed in the samples with PVA thickness less than 25 nm, but becomes inconspicuous when PVA thickness is greater than 25 nm. Plotting the ratio of emission intensity of the nanowire end to that of the middle part, Iend/Imid, versus PVA thickness, d, leads to the same conclusion, which is supported by further investigation with other three emission band-pass filters (Fig. 4(b)). When the four sets of emission band-pass filters (DAPI, CFP, GFP and Rhod-like) with 445 ± 50, 480 ± 40, 525 ± 50 and 608 ± 65 nm spectral width are employed to record the emission from the nanowires, the d values that correspond to the maximum Iend/Imid are 10 nm (1.38), 18 nm (1.40), 10 nm (1.46) and 3 nm (1.61), respectively. This coincides with the results reported by Fedutik et al., who observed the most efficient excitation of SPPs (Iend/Imid = 3.8) in core–shell ((Ag)SiO2)CdSe with SiO2 spacer thickness of about 15 nm.20 Here, the dependence of PCFOz–PVA–Ag nanowire emission intensity on d is the result of competition of different energy relaxation mechanisms caused by the vicinity of a metallic nanowire as shown in Fig. 1.33,34 It is worth noting that for an ((Ag)SiO2)CdSe system, Iend/Imid dropped to less than 1 when spacer thickness increased to 28 nm, while for PCFOz–PVA–Ag, Iend/Imid is still larger than 1 in the case of much larger spacer thickness, e.g. Iend/Imid ≈ 1.22 as d = 70 nm, and Iend/Imid ≈ 1.14 as d = 125 nm. Evidently, the phenomena are indicative of high-efficiency coupling between the conjugated polymer and nanowire SPPs.

The power density of the incident light is about 32.8 mW cm−2, and the exposure time is 46 ms. (b) Ratio of emission intensity of the nanowire end to that of the middle part, Iend/Imid, as a function of PVA thickness, d. Four sets of fluorescence filter were used: (i) DAPI-like (exposure time = 12 ms), (ii) CFP-like (exposure time = 20 ms), (iii) GFP-like (exposure time = 50 ms), and (iv) Rhod-like (exposure time = 1256 ms). 
In practical applications, photostability of organic light emitting devices is an issue of primary importance. The penetrated oxygen would accelerate photo-oxidation and photodegradation, resulting in poor quantum efficiency. It is therefore necessary to investigate photobleaching behavior of the PCFOz–Ag composite system for reducing this process. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the PL intensity of PCFOz starts to rapidly drop at 1200 ms and is almost completely gone when reaching 15 s. For the coupled PCFOz–Ag nanowires system, the fluorescence image also fades within a very short period of time as d = 0 (Fig. 5(a)), while the polymer becomes more robust over the same period of time by introducing a thin PVA layer between the PCFOz and Ag nanowires (Fig. 5(b)). Fig. 5(c) shows that the PL intensity decreases more gently as a thicker PVA layer is inserted. To understand how the PVA spacer regulates the photostability of the PCFOz–Ag nanowire system, the relative initial change, RIC, defined to be (I0 − It)/I0, where I0 and It denote PL intensity at time = 0 and t, respectively,35 is plotted as a function of thickness of PVA layer (Fig. 5(d)). It can be seen that when the thickness of PVA increases from 0 to 25 nm, RIC decreases from 0.84 to 0.04. This suggests that the photostability of PCFOz is enhanced by more than 20 times owing to the hindrance of PVA. Since the ratio of emission intensity of the nanowire end to that of the middle part, Iend/Imid, remains constant over an entire time range of interests, the above statistical analysis based on fluorescence microscopy images should not be affected by photobleaching (Fig. S3†).

(c) Time dependence of normalized fluorescence intensity of PCFOz–PVA–Ag nanowires as a function of PVA layer thickness. (d) Dependence of the relative initial change, RIC, in PL intensity on PVA layer thickness as a function of time. The plots are derived from (c), in which the four time points are indicated by arrows. All the samples were excited by 365 nm HBO lamp, and DAPI emission band-pass filter was used. Exposure time was 12 ms. 
Exciton–plasmon coupling is dependent on spacer thickness and as well as spectra. As exhibited by Fig. 6(a), the scattered light from the nanowire tips becomes brighter when the band-pass filter is switched from the blue to the red region (DAPI → CFP → GFP → Rhod). Meanwhile, one can see that Iend/Imid increases with increasing emission wavelength in the case of different PVA thickness (Fig. 6(b)). The wavelength dependence of Iend/Imid can be understood from the dispersion of the interface between metal and dielectric medium.3,36,37 For the red part of the standing surface plasmon wave (captured by Rhod-like collector), the dispersion curve follows the light line very closely, resulting in the large group velocities, dω/dk, of the waves. The intrinsic losses given by the imaginary part of the complex permittivity εm′′ in the nanowires are small and the SPPs propagate for relatively long distances along the wires. For the blue part (captured by the DAPI-like collector), the curve flattens out asymptotically to reach , where ωSPP is the SPPs frequency of the silver nanowires. As εm′′ increases with these excitation frequencies, the group velocity is reduced to a smaller quantity. The consequence of this behavior can be observed as a dispersion of the propagation length of various spectral components composing the SPPs continuum. The blue part of the spectrum tends to be more confined to the excitation spot, whereas the longer wavelengths propagate relatively long distances along the Ag nanowires.

To gain further insight into the PCFOz–SPPs coupling, micro-photoluminescence imaging analysis was compared with detailed fluorescence decay dynamics. PCFOz–PVA–Ag nanowires were excited by a picosecond pulsed diode laser emitting at 405 nm, and the diameter of the excitation laser spot (∼1 mm2) was far greater than the nanowire length (∼5 μm), so that the obtained fluorescence decay profiles are averaged behavior of PCFOz with coupled and uncoupled cases. Fig. 7 shows that the decay curves are highly non-exponential due to the complex combination of radiative and non-radiative decay rates. To qualitatively discuss the distance dependence of the radiative component in the decay dynamics, all the curves in Fig. 7 were fitted by three exponential decay rates. Iterative reconvolution was used and the influence of the instrument response function, IRF, was also taken into account: (1)Where τ1, τ2 and τ3 are the decay times, and A1, A2 and A3 represent the amplitudes of the components at t = 0, respectively.

Table 1 summarizes the fitting results of the time resolved fluorescence decays of PCFOz and PCFOz–PVA–Ag nanowires. At long wavelength, a slower time component of around 2 ns arises, possibly because of the presence of photo-oxidization, ketonic defects or other emissive defects of the conjugated polymer. The fast components around 200–800 ps are ascribed to the lifetime of PCFOz.38 Since we are primarily interested in evaluation of the maximum performance of the spacer design, only the fastest decay is analyzed hereinafter. A fit of the early dynamics of PCFOz–PVA–Ag nanowires with large spacer thickness (d ∼125 nm) yields a longer initial decay time τ1 with smaller amplitude A1. The sample with the optimum spacer thickness (3 or 25 nm) exhibits a distinctly faster initial decay and lager amplitude A1. Thus, in agreement with the enhancement of emission intensity shown above, we observe a consistent enhancement in the PCFOz emission dynamics predominantly owing to the change of the radiative part of the overall decay.

Theoretically, for an optimally placed PCFOz molecule, the spontaneous emission rate, γpl, into SPPs can far exceed the radiative and non-radiative rates (γrad and γnrd, respectively), resulting in highly efficient coupling to surface plasmons and enhancement of the total decay rate in plasmonic cavity, γcav, as compared to that of an uncoupled emitter radiating into free space, γfree. This enhancement can be described using a Purcell factor:39 (2)where Q is the quality factor, V and n are the mode volume and the cavity refractive index, respectively. P is indicative of the decay rate of the photon emitter modified by the cavity. The spontaneous decay rate is enhanced if P > 1, or reduced if 0 < P < 1.

Fig. 8 shows the Purcell factor, P, of PCFOz–PVA–Ag nanowires as a function of the distance between PCFOz and Ag nanowires. It is found that the highest enhancement factors of 1.22 (d = 25 nm) at 445 nm and 9.18 (d = 18 nm) at 590 nm are in good agreement with the aforesaid fluorescence microscopy results, and the similar enhancement manner has been observed from the parallel composite system fabricated using different substrates, for example, glass (not shown here). On the other hand, the Purcell factor of PCFOz–PVA–Ag nanowires is much smaller than that of Ag–Ag nanowires gap nanocavity (∼1000),40 because the Q value of Ag nanowires-based plasmonic cavity is still far below the values needed to greatly affect the spontaneous emission enhancement. Furthermore, the maximum value of P is observed for an emission wavelength red-shifted from the plasmon resonance of metallic wires (Fig. S4†), which may be to do with the competition between radiative and non-radiative channels. At the plasmon resonance, both γrad and γnrd are enhanced, but the enhancement is much larger for γnrd, so the quantum yield is always low at plasmon resonance, but strongly increases for larger wavelengths.41

Conclusion
In this work, conjugated polymer is optically excited in close proximity to silver nanowires. Accordingly, excitons in the conjugated polymer directly couple to the guided surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in the nanowires, and propagate towards the wires' ends and light up. Compared with QDs and dye molecules, the fluorescent polymer not only provides homogeneous optical dipolar near-field effect and the capability of making a flexible substrate, its high-efficiency excitonic emission also couples effectively into guided SPPs along the crystallized Ag nanowires. This exciton–plasmon coupling can be tuned by varying the distance between luminescent molecules and metal wires. The experimental results demonstrate an efficient excitation of SPPs in the case of PVA spacer ∼10 nm thick. Meanwhile, introduction of PVA spacer layer to such an organic system obviously improves its photostability by more than 20 times, giving hope for the application of light-emitting polymer in plasmonic waveguides with long-term stability. A remarkable wavelength-dependent emission intensity from the tips of Ag nanowires indicates that the red components of SPPs propagate over a longer distance with lower loss, while the blue parts, per contra, propagate over a much shorter distance. We have also provide evidence that metal-optical nanocavities are capable of achieving almost 9-fold averaged enhancement of spontaneous emission relative to the same emitter in a bulk dielectric film, and the relationship between Purcell factor and spacer thickness is proved to be coincident with micro-PL results. It is believed that the system presented here may open up a new route to fabricate nanophotonic hybrid devices based on polymeric materials, towards low-cost and flexible nanoscale integrated systems.

 	Fig. 1  Exciton–SPPs conversion in a coupled conjugated polymer–Ag nanowire system. A coupled PCFOz molecule can spontaneously emit photons either to free space or into the guided SPPs of the nanowire with respective rates of γrad and γpl.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Layout of the sample containing conjugate polymer and Ag nanowires. (b) AFM height images of PCFOz film surface. (c) TEM image of an individual Ag nanowire. The inset shows a SEM image of Ag nanowires. (d) SAED pattern of Ag nanowire. (e) HRTEM image showing the structure at the end of a Ag nanowire.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Sketch of experimental setup. (b) Bright field image of Ag nanowire illuminated by HAL lamp. (c) Fluorescence image of Ag nanowire. (d) Fluorescence image of PCFOz–PVA–Ag nanowire. Both (c) and (d) were illuminated by HBO lamp, using a set of CFP-like fluorescence filters at exposure times of 3 s and 50 ms, respectively. (e) Spatially resolved emission intensity measured along the nanowire axis in (d). The scale bar in (b), (c) and (d) represents 1 μm in length.	 

 	Fig. 4  Distance dependence of PCFOz-nanowire coupling. (a) Fluorescence image of PCFOz–PVA–Ag nanowire using 445 ± 50 nm band-pass filter (CFP-like) with the PVA thickness varying from 3 to 125 nm and length of Ag nanowires ranging from 4.5 to 5.5 μm. The power density of the incident light is about 32.8 mW cm−2, and the exposure time is 46 ms. (b) Ratio of emission intensity of the nanowire end to that of the middle part, Iend/Imid, as a function of PVA thickness, d. Four sets of fluorescence filter were used: (i) DAPI-like (exposure time = 12 ms), (ii) CFP-like (exposure time = 20 ms), (iii) GFP-like (exposure time = 50 ms), and (iv) Rhod-like (exposure time = 1256 ms).	 

 	Fig. 5  Fluorescence images of (a) PCFOz–Ag nanowires and (b) PCFOz–PVA (18 nm)–Ag nanowires were captured at different times. The scale bars represent 2 μm in length. (c) Time dependence of normalized fluorescence intensity of PCFOz–PVA–Ag nanowires as a function of PVA layer thickness. (d) Dependence of the relative initial change, RIC, in PL intensity on PVA layer thickness as a function of time. The plots are derived from (c), in which the four time points are indicated by arrows. All the samples were excited by 365 nm HBO lamp, and DAPI emission band-pass filter was used. Exposure time was 12 ms.	 

 	Fig. 6  Spectral dependence of PCFOz–Ag nanowire coupling. (a) Fluorescence images of PCFOz–PVA (49 nm)–Ag nanowires emission recorded via different emission band-pass filters: (i) DAPI, (ii) CFP, (iii) GFP, and (iv) Rhod-like. The scale bar represent 2 μm in length. (b) Ratios of the emission intensity measured at the nanowire end to that at the middle part, Iend/Imid, as a function of emission wavelength.
