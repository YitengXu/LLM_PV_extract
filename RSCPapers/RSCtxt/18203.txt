In aqueous solution, the singlet quenching rate constant depends upon ionic strength but at zero ionic strength it approaches the diffusion-controlled limit. Overall, the quenching act leads to net electron transfer but the probability of separation of the singlet ion-pair is very low. The efficiency of this separation process is related to the electronic charge on the reactants, the spin-multiplicity of the ion-pair and to the amount of free energy that must be dissipated by the competing internal conversion process.Although the system possesses the capability of collecting ca. 45% of the solar spectrum, irradiation in the presence of EDTA and a colloidal Pt catalyst does not produce H2.
