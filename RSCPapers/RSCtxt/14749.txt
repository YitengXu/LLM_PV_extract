Introduction
As we know, vehicles play an increasingly important role in our modern lives. However, with the decrease of oil resources and the decline of environmental quality, looking for new energy sources for vehicles to replace oil has become a problem that humanity has to face. In recent years, natural gas has been used in some cars. However, exhaust gas emitted by cars still increases the burden on the environment, which may limit its further application. Electrical energy as a clean energy has become the first energy choice for vehicles, because it can be converted from three major renewable sources: wind, solar and hydroelectric.1 In order to store electrical energy used for vehicles, rechargeable batteries are required.
Rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are considered as one of the most promising power sources for electric vehicle (EV) and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) applications due to their high energy density, durable cycle life, higher output power and safety issues.2,3 A LIB mainly consists of a negative electrode (anode) and a positive electrode (cathode) separated and connected by a Li+ conducting electrolyte.4 Cathode materials are one of the most important components of LIBs and play a critical role in determining the performance of LIBs.5 In the past few years, many cathode materials have been reported, such as LiCoO2,6–12 LiMn2O4,13–15 LiMnPO4,16–20 LiTi2(PO4)3,21–23 LiFePO4,24–33 Li3V2(PO4)3,34–41 LiVPO4F42,43 and LiVOPO4.44–46
Superior cathode materials should meet the following requirements: (1) high theoretical capacity; (2) high operating voltage; (3) high energy density; (4) high tap density; (5) long cycle life; (6) good rate performance; (7) good electrochemical and thermal stability; (8) low cost, and (9) safety and environmental friendliness. However, a single cathode material has difficulties in meeting the above-mentioned requirements. In order to solve this problem, the concept of a “hybrid cathode material” was proposed. A so-called hybrid cathode material (Fig. 1) is a composite that combines the advantages of two or more cathode materials. Hybrid cathode materials may be an alternative to conventional single cathode materials. Present study of hybrid cathode materials is mainly focused on the composites of two cathode materials.
 Fig. 1  Hybrid cathode materials for lithium ion batteries. 
Herein, we present a review specially on the recent progress in hybrid cathode materials for LIBs in the past few years. Various hybrid cathode materials such as LiFePO4–Li3V2(PO4)3, LiFePO4–LiCoO2, LiFePO4–LiMn2O4, LiFePO4–LiVPO4F, LiFePO4–LiMnPO4, Li3V2(PO4)3–LiMnPO4, Li3V2(PO4)3–LiVPO4F, Li3V2(PO4)3–LiVOPO4 and LiCoO2–LiMn2O4 are summarized and analyzed. A perspective of hybrid cathode materials is also discussed.
LiFePO4–Li3V2(PO4)3
Since LiFePO4 (LFP) was first reported by Goodenough et al.,47 LFP has been considered as one of the most promising cathode materials for LIBs due to its high theoretical capacity (170 mA h g−1), cycling stability, low cost and environmental friendliness.48 Nowadays, among all the lithium transition metal phosphates such as LiMPO4 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Mn), LiVOPO4 and Li3V2(PO4)3, only LFP has been successfully commercialized. However, although the theoretical capacity of LFP is 170 mA h g−1, the first attempts to de-insert Li from LFP were limited to about 0.6 e− owing to the transport limitations of electrons and ions.47 Lithium motion in the olivine crystal structure occurs through one-dimensional channels, with little possibility of crossing between channels.49 LFP usually shows a poor rate capability because of its low intrinsic electronic conductivity (1.8 × 10−9 S cm−1) and slow Li+ diffusion (10−16–10−14 m2 s−1).50–56 The working voltage (about 3.4 V) and tap density of LFP are relatively low, and Fe2+ in LFP is easily oxidized to Fe3+ in the process of calcination. All of the above-mentioned drawbacks limit the further development and utilization of LFP.
Monoclinic Li3V2(PO4)3 (LVP) is another potential cathode material for LIBs, because it possesses a high theoretical capacity (197 mA h g−1), high operating voltage (about 4 V) and safe performance.57–59 The 3D path created by PO43− units in LVP enables a three dimensional pathway for Li ion insertion/extraction, in contrast to the one dimensional Li ion pathway demonstrated in LFP.60,61 Compared with LFP, monoclinic LVP possesses superior electrical conductivity (2.4 × 10−7 S cm−1) and ionic conductivity (10−9–10−8 S cm−1), which enables Li ions to intercalate and deintercalate effortlessly.62–64 Although LVP has a higher voltage, it invariably suffers from its stepped voltage platforms and severe cycle attenuation, especially under high voltage.65–67
It is obvious that LFP and LVP have their own advantages and drawbacks. In order to integrate the advantages of LFP and LVP, hybrid cathode materials of LFP and LVP have become a research hotspot in recent years. The reasons may be that: (1) the high reversible capacity and high operating voltage of LVP can ensure a high energy density of hybrid cathode materials, and (2) the better ion mobility of LVP is expected to facilitate an excellent rate performance of hybrid cathode materials. The co-existence of V-doped LFP and Fe-doped LVP plays a great role in electron transfer activity and lithium ion diffusivity in hybrid cathode materials.68,69 To date, a series of LFP–LVP hybrid cathode materials have been reported. In order to simplify the synthesis process and improve the electrochemical properties of the electrode material, Xiang et al.70 reported a simple solid-state synthesis of xLFP·yLVP/C composites using micro-size petroleum coke as both a reduction agent and carbon source. The as-prepared material is not a simple mixture of LFP and LVP, but a composite possessing two phases: one is V-doped LFP and the other is Fe-doped LVP. Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of as-prepared xLFP·yLVP/C. When x:y = 1:0 and 0:1, all the diffraction peaks correspond well to orthorhombic LFP and monoclinic LVP, respectively. When x:y = 9:1, 4:1, 1:1, 1:4 and 1:9, both the peaks of orthorhombic LFP and monoclinic LVP appear in the XRD patterns of the as-prepared materials. Besides, no diffraction peaks of carbon are detected in all the products, indicating that the state of coated carbon is amorphous or that the carbon quantity is too small to be detected. Fig. 2b shows the initial charge–discharge curves of xLFP·yLVP/C composites at 1C (charge rate: 1CxLFP·yLVP = (170x + 132y)/(x + y) mA g−1) in a potential range from 2.5–4.3 V. It can be seen that all the composites show similar charge–discharge behavior. In the charging process, long plateaus at around 3.5 V correspond to a phase transition from LiFePO4 to FePO4. The three subsequent plateaus at around 3.6, 3.7 and 4.1 V can be indexed to the transformations of Li3V2(PO4)3 to Li2.5V2(PO4)3, Li2.5V2(PO4)3 to Li2V2(PO4)3, and Li2V2(PO4)3 to LiV2(PO4)3, respectively.58 Obviously, different contents of LFP and LVP phases in the composites mean that they have various electrochemical performances. Among all the composites, the 9LFP·LVP/C composite exhibits the highest discharge capacity of 168 mA h g−1 and an initial coulombic efficiency of 98%. The cycling performance of 9LFP·LVP/C at different rates and working temperatures is shown in Fig. 2c and d. At rates of 1, 5, 10 and 15C, the initial discharge capacities of 9LFP·LVP/C are 168, 143, 131 and 102 mA h g−1, respectively. The discharge capacity is 163 mA h g−1 at 1C after 80 cycles and 125 mA h g−1 at 10C after 150 cycles. Moreover, at temperatures of 65, 0 and −20 °C, the reversible capacities of 9LFP·LVP/C are 166, 134 and 115 mA h g−1, respectively. Even after 150 cycles at −20 °C, the capacity of 9LFP·LVP/C is still 75% of that at room temperature. The improved electrochemical performance of 9LFP·LVP/C is greatly attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity of 9LFP·LVP/C is improved to 2.50 × 10−2 S cm−1, much higher than that of pristine LFP/C (6.75 × 10−3 S cm−1) and LVP/C (2.88 × 10−3 S cm−1). It is also suggested that the excellent cycling performance at a high rate and wide working temperature range is attributed to the interaction between V-doped LFP and Fe-doped LVP in the composite, which increases the electronic conductivity and facilitates the insertion/extraction of lithium ions.

The V or Fe resources used to synthesize LFP–LVP composites are often different. The most commonly used V resources are V2O5 and NH4VO3, and the most commonly used Fe resources are Fe2O3 and FeCl3. Different starting materials usually lead to different synthesis methods, so the methods to synthesize LFP–LVP composites are various. Recently, Zheng et al.71 reported a new way to synthesize LFP–LVP composite cathode material. Firstly, they used NH4VO3 and Fe(NO3)3 as starting materials to synthesize a fine precursor, FeVO4, then synthesized a LFP–LVP composite by chemical reduction and lithiation. Fig. 3a shows the XRD pattern of a LFP–LVP composite synthesized at 700 °C for 12 h. It can be seen that the diffraction peaks of the synthesized composite are composed of both LFP and LVP, indicating that the synthesized composite is a mixture of LFP and LVP. Fig. 3b shows the initial charge–discharge curves of LFP–LVP/Li cells at different rates in a potential range of 2.5–4.5 V. The curves all contain four plateaus, with three plateaus for LVP and the other one for LFP. As seen in Fig. 3c, the initial discharge capacities of the LFP–LVP composite are about 142.5, 138.4 and 123.4 mA h g−1 at the rates of 0.1, 1 and 3C, respectively, and the corresponding discharge capacities are about 139.1, 135.5 and 116 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles.

The polyol process is considered as an promising process to synthesize LFP with wonderful electrochemical performance. The polyol medium itself acts not only as a solvent in the process but also as a stabilizer, limiting particle growth and prohibiting agglomeration. Moreover, a polyol process provides a reducing environment, which is extremely advantageous for synthesizing LFP, because it is difficult to obtain divalent iron containing LFP.69,72 To get an LFP·LVP composite with excellent electrochemical performance, Gao et al.69 successfully synthesized a LFP·LVP/C composite via a polyol process. They used citric acid and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as carbon sources, and triethylene glycol (TEG) as both a solvent and reductant. The XRD patterns of as-prepared pristine LFP/C, pristine LVP/C and xLFP·yLVP/C composites are shown in Fig. 4a. The patterns of pristine LFP/C and pristine LVP/C are in agreement with those of PDF (019-721) and PDF (053-1027), respectively. The diffraction peaks of xLFP·yLVP/C are composed of both LFP and LVP peaks, and no other phase was checked. Fig. 4b shows the initial charge–discharge curves of xLFP·yLVP/C composites at 0.1C rate in a potential range from 2.5–4.3 V. Four plateaus are found in all charge curves. The first plateaus at around 3.4 V are attributed to the Li+ insertion/extraction of LFP, and the other three plateaus at around 3.60, 3.68 and 4.08 V are connected to the Li+ insertion/extraction of LVP. It can be seen from Fig. 4b that the discharge capacity of the LF0.6P·LV0.4P/C composite is 140 mA h g−1, while those of the other xLFP·yLVP/C composites are less than 130 mA h g−1. Fig. 4c shows the cycling performances of pristine LFP/C, pristine LVP/C and xLFP·yLVP/C composites at different rates (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 10C). The pristine LFP/C exhibits the highest discharge capacities at 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2C of 155, 145, 140 and 130 mA h g−1, respectively. However, the LF0.6P·LV0.4P/C exhibits the highest discharge capacities at 5 and 10C of 125 and 110 mA h g−1, respectively. Furthermore, the discharge capacity remains 110 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 10C and the coulombic efficiency is almost 100% at 10C in the 50 cycles. They predicted that the combination of Fe2+-doped LVP/C and V3+-doped LFP/C was the main factor behind the high rate performance of LF0.6P·LV0.4P/C composite.

From what we have described above, we can understand that different proportions of Fe and V give different electrochemical performances, and that the same proportions of Fe and V may also give varying electrochemical performances, which can be attributed to different synthetic methods. However, few reports have paid attention to the theoretical specific capacity of LFP–LVP hybrid cathode materials. In general, LVP is usually allowed to extract and insert two lithium ions reversibly to prevent the decomposition of electrolyte (<4.5 V). In this case, the theoretical specific capacity of the LFP–LVP composite will increase with an increase of LFP, because in this charge–discharge potential range (usually 2.0–4.5 V), the theoretical capacity of LFP (170 mA h g−1) is higher than that of LVP (133 mA h g−1). Although the discharge capacity of LFP–LVP hybrid cathode materials may be not as good as that of LFP alone, the overall electrochemical performances of LFP–LVP hybrid cathode materials are superior than those of single LFP or LVP in some respects, such as high rate performance, electrical conductivity, ionic conductivity and average working voltage, because the hybrid cathode materials combine the advantages of both LFP and LVP.
Obviously, LFP–LVP hybrid cathode materials have been studied a lot in the past few years. However, problems still exist. The composite mechanism between LFP and LVP is still controversial. The final product is a solid solution or just a simple mixture between LFP and LVP. How to get an optimal proportion of LFP to LVP is still a problem, and needs much more research work. In the future, researchers should pay more attention to modification work of LFP–LVP hybrid cathode materials. Firstly, an optimal proportion of LFP to LVP should be determined. Then, various modification methods such as carbon coating, ion doping, nanocrystallization and controlling of morphology should be adopted to improve the electrochemical performance of LFP–LVP hybrid cathode materials. Furthermore, synthetic methods also need to be considered.
LiFePO4–LiCoO2
Layered structure LiCoO2 (LCO) is the first commercialized LIB cathode material and has been used in most commercial LIBs. LCO is easily prepared and has a high energy density, high operational voltage, good cyclability and good electrochemical performance at an elevated temperature with a charging voltage lower than 4.2 V.83,84 LCO can deliver a specific capacity of 140 mA h g−1 when charged up to 4.2 V versus Li+/Li. In fact, LCO has a high theoretical capacity of 274 mA h g−1, in order to obtain a higher capacity, it needs to be charged above 4.2 V.85–87 However, its capacity fades quickly when the charging voltage is beyond 4.2 V, which is attributed to structural instability and/or irreversible phase transition.88,89 Doping or coating is an effective method to improve the performance of LCO.
As we described before, LFP has many advantages and has already achieved commercialization. Considering that the coating of LCO by LFP may improve both the thermal stability and electrochemical performance of LCO, Wang et al.83 prepared LFP-coated LCO by an impregnation method. Fig. 5a shows the XRD patterns of bare and 5.0 wt% LFP-coated LCO. Obvious diffraction patterns of crystalline LFP can be found in 5.0 wt% LFP-coated LCO (labeled by # in Fig. 5a), indicating that the coating layer is crystalline LFP. Fig. 5b shows the charge–discharge curves of bare and LFP-coated cathodes at 1C in 2.5–4.2 V. The discharge capacity of the bare cathode dropped from 140 to 88 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, while there was almost no capacity loss after 50 cycles for the coated cathode. Unlike other usually used coating materials such as MgO, ZrO2, TiO2 or Al2O3, the LFP coating layer is not only an active cathode material but also a protecting layer for LCO, which results in an improved electrochemical performance. In order to examine the chemical stability of the coating layer, the cycling performances of the bare and LFP-coated LCO were tested and the results are shown in Fig. 5c. After 250 cycles at a cutoff voltage of 4.2 V at 60 °C, the capacity fading rate of the coated cathode material is only 8.5%, while it is about 95% after only 150 cycles when using bare LCO as the cathode material. For comparison, the capacity retention of the bare cathode is 85% after 250 cycles when cycled at 25 °C. This indicates that the LFP coating layer was not corroded during cycling at 60 °C and did not lose its protective effect towards LCO. The result also indicates that the LFP layer is strong enough to protect the core material from being exposed to the electrolyte at a higher operating temperature.

Nanocrystallization, cation doping and coating a conductive layer on the surface of LFP are three commonly used methods for improving the low electrical conductivity of LFP. So, the low electrical conductivity of LFP material may be improved by adding LCO to LFP. In order to improve the poor electrical conductivity of LFP, Kim et al.84 synthesized a mixed cathode using a solid state method by adding LCO to LFP. Fig. 6a shows the XRD patterns of the mixed electrodes prepared from the LFP powder with 5, 10, 20 wt% of LCO added, respectively. When 5 wt% of LCO was added, the (003) peak was observed at around 18°, and when 10 wt% was added, the (006)/(012), (108)/(110), (101) and (104) layered peaks started to become observable.90 However, peak changes in the XRD patterns do not indicate the formation of other compounds, but rather that two compounds were mixed physically with each other. Fig. 6b shows the cycling performances of as-received LFP and LCO-added LFP at a current rate of 0.5C in a potential range of 2.0–4.0 V. It can be seen from Fig. 6b that the initial discharge capacity of the bare-LFP material was maintained even after 100 cycles, proving its excellent cycling performance. The mixed electrode with 5 wt% of LCO added also showed very good cycling performance, similar to the bare-LFP active material. The mixed electrode with 10 wt% of LCO added still showed a very good cycling performance, although it did show a small decrease in discharge capacity during charge–discharge cycling. However, the mixed electrode with 20 wt% of LCO added started to show slight capacity fading after ten charge–discharge cycles. The reason why capacity fading increases for the 20 wt% LCO-added mixed electrode is that the cycling performance of LCO is lower than that of LFP. They finally concluded that the higher the ratio of LCO up to 10 wt% that is added to the LFP material, the better the rate capability of the mixed electrode, and the more its thermal stability and cycling performance are degraded.

Compared to LFP–LVP hybrid cathode materials, reports about LFP–LCO are relatively few. The reasons are various. The structures of LFP and LCO are different, which may affect the homogeneity of hybrid cathode materials. LCO and LFP have already achieved commercialization and are used in many electronic devices, so adding LFP to LCO (or adding LCO to LFP) to improve the performance of LCO (or LFP) may be not so important. The synthetic processes of LFP–LCO cathode materials are also complex. Furthermore, safety issues, high cost, toxicity and environmental concerns limit the further development of LCO.
LiFePO4–LiMn2O4
Spinel LiMn2O4 (LMO) cathode material for LIBs has been extensively investigated due to its low cost and toxicity. Spinel LMO, which has three-dimensional lithium diffusion paths, is considered as a potentially attractive alternative to the presently commercialized LCO.91 It has a high discharge voltage plateau of approximately 4.0 V and a theoretical reversible capacity of approximately 148 mA h g−1. However, severe capacity and cycling performance fading during cycling prohibit LMO from commercialization.92,93 In order to improve the electrochemical performance of LMO, Sadeghi et al.91 coated an LMO cathode with a nanostructured LFP layer. Firstly, spinel LMO particles was synthesized by a solid-state reaction, then the surface of these particles was modified by nanostructured LFP via a sol gel dip coating method. The LFP-modified LMO can be protected from Mn dissolution, because nanostructured LFP is formed on the surface of the spinel LMO cathode. Fig. 7a shows the XRD patterns of uncoated bare LMO and LMO coated with LFP. The lattice constants of bare LMO and modified LMO were calculated from the XRD spectra to be 0.821 and 0.823 nm, respectively. Obviously, the modified samples have a larger lattice constant than the bare spinel. LFP may form not only a thin layer on the surface of the spinel but also a solid solution by interacting with spinel.94 In addition, the decrease in the lattice parameter of the modified sample may be due to the substitution of iron ions with manganese. An increase of the lattice constant can make the crystal structure more stable, leading to the stable cycling performance of LFP-modified LMO during the charge–discharge process. Fig. 7b and c show SEM images of the surface and cross-section of an LFP thin film deposited on an LMO substrate, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 7c, the thickness of the film is about 300 nm. Fig. 7d shows the cycling performances of bare LMO and LMO coated with LFP at 1C in a potential range of 3.0–4.3 V. It is obvious that surface modification significantly improves the cyclability of LMO. The presence of the LFP phosphate layer not only leads to a better electrical conductivity of the LMO particles, but also lowers or hinders additional reactions of the cathode material with the electrolyte. All in all, this improves the cyclic capacity of the battery at higher rates and also results in higher discharge rates of cathode materials made of LMO coated with a phosphate layer of LFP.

Considering that spinel LMO and olivine LFP are competitive and complementary to each other, and they have their own merits relative to their counterparts when compared with one another, Qiu et al.95 prepared LMO/LFP blends by hand milling and ball milling using commercial LFP and LMO. Fig. 8a shows the XRD patterns of commercial LMO and LFP samples. It can be seen that the XRD pattern of LMO can be indexed well to a cubic spinel structure (space group Fd3m) and the XRD pattern of LFP fits well with that of an orthorhombic olivine-type structure with a space group Pnma. In order to study the effects of mass ratio on the electrochemical performances of the blended cathodes, LMO/LFP blends with mass fractions of LMO varying from 100%, 80%, 50%, 20% and 0% were prepared by hand milling. The samples are denoted as LFP-0, LFP-0.2, LFP-0.5, LFP-0.8 and LFP-1.0, respectively. Fig. 8b compares the cycling performances of the LMO/LFP blend electrodes. It is obvious that LMO (LFP-0) has a much better cycling stability than LFP (LFP-1.0). The cycling performances of the LFP-0.2 and LFP-0.5 electrodes are as good as that of the LMO electrode. However, the discharge capacity gradually decreases with further addition of LFP (LFP-0.8). Based on the above observations, the LFP-0.5 sample seems to be the best one which provides not only a high discharge capacity but also a good cycle stability.

The capacity fading of LMO seems to be more serious than that of LFP. Coating LMO with an LFP layer may be an effective method to solve this problem. However, LMO is usually calcined in an air atmosphere, and LFP is usually calcined in an inert gas atmosphere. The difference in calcination atmospheres between LFP and LMO may be an unfavorable factor for synthesizing LFP–LMO hybrid cathode materials. Enough reducing agent is required in the calcining process of LFP, while too much reducing agent will inhibit the formation of LMO. So, LFP and LMO are usually synthesized separately, and are then mixed by ball milling. In the future, researchers should pay attention to this problem.
LiFePO4–LiVPO4F
LiVPO4F (LVPF) is considered as one of the most promising cathode materials for the development of LIBs due to its high rate capability, high working potential, excellent cycling performance, stable structure and high thermal stability against electrolytes.96,97 The theoretical specific capacity of LVPF for lithium deintercalation/reintercalation is about 156 mA h g−1.98 A flat voltage plateau at about 4.2 V (vs. Li/Li+) suggests a typical two-phase reaction mechanism during charge/discharge.99 LVPF is isostructural with the naturally occurring mineral tavorite, LiFePO4·OH, crystallizing with a triclinic structure.100,101 Furthermore, the thermal stability and specific energy of LVPF are superior to those of LFP.102,103 However, when LVPF is exposed to air/moisture, it is difficult to avoid surface oxidation and moisture absorption, which will result in structural changes of LVPF. As a result, it may show poor electrochemical performance due to partial vanadium oxidation and/or lithium and fluorine loss.104,105
As described above, LVPF has a working potential of 4.2 V vs. Li+/Li, which is within the electrochemical window of conventional, carbonate-based, non-aqueous electrolytes and is slightly higher than that of LFP (4.1 V vs. Li+/Li).42 In order to raise the operating voltage of LFP, Lin et al.101 introduced LVPF to prepare xLFP·(1 − x)LVPF [x:(1 − x) = 1:0, 0.99:0.01, 0.75:0.25, 0.5:0.5, 0.25:0.75 and 0:1] composites through an aqueous precipitation and carbothermal reduction method. Fig. 9a shows the XRD patterns of two-component xLFP·(1 − x)LVPF powders with different mole ratios of x:(1 − x). When x = 1 and 0, the diffraction patterns exhibit a pure phase of LFP and LVPF, respectively. When x:(1 − x) = 0.99:0.01, there are no second phases or impurities found in the diffraction pattern. Co-existing phases of LFP and LVPF are observed for the LFP–LVPF (x = 0.75, 0.5 and 0.25) composites. Among all the LFP–LVPF composites, the LFP–LVPF (x = 0.99) composite demonstrated the best discharge capacity with a flat discharge plateau at about 3.4 V vs. Li/Li+ and a slight voltage polarization of about 0.06 V between two plateaus at 0.1C rate, as shown in Fig. 9b. The LFP–LVPF (x = 0.99) composite achieved a reversible capacity of 160 mA h g−1 at 0.2C. Fig. 9c and d show the charge–discharge curves of pure LFP and LVPF at different rates, respectively. It is clear that the charge–discharge performance of LFP–LVPF (x = 0.99) is much better than that of pure LFP or LVPF.

Reports about LFP–LVPF hybrid cathode materials are limited. The synthesis conditions of LVPF are very strict. Moreover, the toxicity of fluorine and vanadium limit its further development.
LiFePO4–LiMnPO4
In addition to the above-mentioned hybrid cathode materials, many other hybrid cathode materials consisting of LFP have also been reported, such as LiFePO4–LiMnPO4 (LFP–LMP).106,107
Based on the fact that coating the members of the olivine family LMP with conductive carbon is difficult, except in the case of M = Fe, Zaghib et al.106 coated LMP with a thin layer of LFP to take advantage of the catalytic reaction of Fe with C, and a 3 nm-thick layer of carbon can be deposited at the surface of this composite. The carbon coating on top of the LFP layer is shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 10 also illustrates that the interface between LMP and LFP is sharp. Moreover, the LFP layer is well crystallized. They found that the electrochemical properties of the carbon-coated LFP–LMP composite were improved with respect to a carbon-coated LiMn2/3Fe1/3PO4 solid solution with a comparable Fe/Mn ratio.

Li3V2(PO4)3–LiMnPO4
LiMnPO4 (LMP) is another promising member among olivine phosphates gaining more and more attention from researchers. Compared with the commercially successful LFP, LMP has a similar theoretical capacity of 171 mA h g−1, but can provide about a 20% higher energy density than LFP due to the higher redox potential of Mn3+/Mn2+ (4.1 V) than Fe3+/Fe2+ (3.5 V).47 Moreover, the 4.1 V intercalation potential of LMP is compatible with conventional nonaqueous organic electrolytes of lithium ion batteries.108 However, just like LFP, LMP suffers from poor electronic conductivity (<10−10 S cm−1) and low lithium diffusivity due to the heavy polaronic holes localized on the Mn3+ sites (the Jahn–Teller ion) and the interfacial strain between the LiMnPO4 and MnPO4 phases.109–111
Based on this, low cost LMP with highly conducting LVP may bring some synergistic effects and result in superior electrochemical activity. Wang et al.112 synthesized a series of xLMP·yLVP/C (x/y = 1:0, 8:1, 4:1, 2:1, 1:1 and 0:1) composites by spray drying followed by a solid-state reaction using sucrose as a carbon source and reductive agent. Fig. 11a shows the XRD patterns of the xLMP·yLVP/C (x/y = 1:0, 8:1, 4:1, 2:1, 1:1 and 0:1) composites. It can be seen that when x/y = 1:0, all the diffraction peaks can be assigned to the orthorhombic LMP phase with a Pnmb space group (JCPDS 74-0375). When x/y = 0:1, a monoclinic LVP single-phase structure (space group P21/n, JCPDS 47-0107) can be observed. When x/y = 8:1, 4:1, 2:1 and 1:1, the as-prepared composites are composed of orthorhombic LMP and monoclinic LVP phases without other impurities, and the relative diffraction peak intensity of LMP·LVP decreases with the increase of LVP content. There is no evidence of diffraction peaks for crystalline carbon in all samples, indicating that the state of carbon is amorphous. Fig. 11b shows the initial charge–discharge curves of the xLMP·yLVP/C composites at 0.1C in a potential range of 2.4–4.8 V. Among all the xLMP·yLVP/C (x/y = 8:1, 4:1, 2:1 and 1:1) composites, the LMP·LVP/C sample delivers the highest discharge capacity of 155 mA h g−1, about 48% higher than that of LMP/C (105 mA h g−1). The enhanced performance is not only attributed to the higher theoretical capacity of LVP (15.2% more), but also to the higher utilization of LMP after the composition of highly conducting LVP nano-domains and V doping. V doping into the host lattice of lithium transition-metal phosphates or forming composites may be an effective method to improve their electrochemical performance.108 In order to improve the electrochemical performance of an LMP cathode material, Qin et al.108 prepared a series of (1 − x)LiMnPO4·xLi3V2(PO4)3/C [(1 − x)LMP·xLVP/C] (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 1) composites through a solid-state method using glucose as a carbon source and reduction agent. For comparison, a (1 − x)LMP + xLVP/C mixture with x = 0.4 was also prepared through mixing 60% LMP/C with 40% LVP/C. Fig. 12a shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared (1 − x)LMP·xLVP/C samples and the (1 − x)LMP + xLVP/C mixture with x = 0.4. When x = 0, all the diffraction peaks correspond well to an orthorhombic LMP phase with a Pnmb space group (ICSD #25834). When x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5, both the peaks of orthorhombic LMP and monoclinic LVP (space group P21/n, ICSD #96962) appear in the XRD patterns of the as-prepared materials. It can be seen that there is a noticeable difference in the characteristic peaks as the ratios of the two materials change. The diffraction peak intensity of LVP would gradually become stronger with an increasing amount of LVP additive. However, for the samples with a high LVP additive content (x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 1), a few impurities are also observed, which could be indexed to a monoclinic LiVP2O7 (LVP2) phase (ICSD #80551). Furthermore, it should be noted that the diffraction peak of the 0.6LMP + 0.4LVP/C mixture, indicated by the red line, shifts (about 0.13°) to a higher angle compared to that of the 0.6LMP·0.4LVP/C composite. No obvious diffraction peak of carbon is detected in all the samples, indicating that the coated carbon is amorphous or the amount of carbon is too small to be measured. Fig. 12b shows the TEM image of 0.6LMP·0.4LVP/C. It can be seen that there are two kinds of lattice fringes in Fig. 12b, one is the lattice fringe of LMP (interplanar spacing 0.374 nm, lattice plane (101)) and the other is the lattice fringe of LVP (interplanar spacing 0.365 nm, lattice plane (121), ICSD #96962). The lattice fringes become obscure on the particle boundaries between LMP and LVP, indicating the coexistence of both LMP and LVP phases. Fig. 12c shows the initial charge–discharge curves of the (1 − x)LMP·xLVP/C (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 1) samples at 0.05C rate in a potential range of 2.0–4.5 V. It is obvious that when the amount of LVP additive increases, the specific capacities of the composites increase. Among all the samples, the 0.6LMP·0.4LVP/C composite shows the highest discharge capacity of 154 mA h g−1 at 0.05C rate. The cycling performances of all the samples are shown in Fig. 12d and were measured through charging at a rate of 0.2C and discharging at a rate of 0.5C. The outstanding performances can be ascribed to the existence of an open 3D framework of the electronically conductive LVP phase and the doping of V into the crystal structure of LMP.

LMP has a similar structure and theoretical capacity to LFP, but can provide a higher working potential and energy density than LFP. However, LFP has achieved commercialization and LMP still remains at the stage of theoretical research. Much more work still need to be done on cathode materials containing Mn due to their intrinsic defects. It is necessary to note that LVP and LMP both have a voltage platform at 4.1 V, so the charge–discharge curves may overlap at this voltage. LMP seems to have a brighter future than LFP, and so future work should focus on its modification.
Li3V2(PO4)3–LiVPO4F
In recent years, framework-structured Li-containing fluorophosphates of d-metals such as LiVPO4F/C (LVPF/C) have been explored as prospective high-voltage cathode materials for rechargeable LIBs.117 Triclinic structured lithium vanadium fluorophosphate with a chemical formula of LiVPO4F was first reported by Barker et al.118 Because of the impact of structural fluorine on the inductive effect of the PO43− polyanion, the V3+/V4+ redox couple in LVPF is located at a high potential of about 4.2 V, which is about 0.3 V higher than the average potential for the same transition (V3+/V4+) in lithium vanadium phosphate, LVP.118 Furthermore, LVPF exhibits higher electronic conductivity than traditional phosphates such as LFP, LMP and LiVOPO4.100 Considering the advantages of LVP and LVPF, Wang et al.119 synthesized an xLVP–LVPF/C composite coated with carbon via mechanically activated chemical reduction followed by annealing. The value of x is designed to be 2.0 but in fact is 2.7 in the prepared sample because of the volatilization of HF and VF3. Fig. 13a shows the structural characterization of the prepared material, which was carried out using powder X-ray diffraction. It can be seen that two phases of LVP and LVPF are detected without other undesired phases such as LiF or V2O3. Fig. 13b shows the morphology of the prepared sample. The grain boundary of crystalline LVP and LVPF can be seen clearly in Fig. 13b, indicating that the LVP and LVPF crystals insert into each other well in the prepared composite. Fig. 13c shows the initial charge–discharge curves of a Li/xLVP–LVPF half cell at various rates in a potential range of 3.0–4.4 V. The initial discharge capacities are 139, 137, 135, 131 and 123 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 1, 2, 5 and 10C, respectively. Fig. 13d shows the cycling performance of the Li/xLVP–LVPF half cell at various rates. It can be seen that the cell retains 98.9%, 99.5%, 99.5% and 97.3% of its initial discharge capacity after 50, 100, 100 and 300 cycles at 1, 2, 5 and 10C, respectively. Furthermore, after 300 cycles at 10C, only a slight capacity fade at 1C is obtained. The good electrochemical performance of the synthesized sample is attributed to the synergistic effect of the LVP–LVPF composite, as well as the carbon coating.

As mentioned before, the synthetic conditions of LVPF are strict. Furthermore, it is hard to get the desired proportion of LVP and LVPF, because the content of F is easily decreased in the synthesis process of LVPF. How to control the loss of F may be the first step. In the future, researchers should also pay attention to the safety problems caused by V and F, especially for the body.
Li3V2(PO4)3–LiVOPO4
LiVOPO4 (LVOP) is a potential contender for a high voltage cathode material due to its high theoretical capacity of 166 mA h g−1, higher lithium intercalation potential of nearly 4 V and high theoretical energy density.120 However, only part of the theoretical capacity can be obtained for LVOP, and its capacity decreases considerably, giving low electrical conductivity and Li ion diffusion.121 LVP is often used as an additive to enhance the conductivity of cathode materials which have low conductivity due to its fast ionic conduction in bulk material.59,68,122–124 Recently, Shen et al.120 synthesized a serious of multi-layered core–shell LVOP–LVP composites through a two-stage sintering method. The precursor was firstly sintered at 700 °C for 10 h under an inert atmosphere to form LVP. Then, the inert atmosphere was removed until the temperature dropped to 350 °C. Finally, the as-prepared LVP was sintered at 350 °C for different times in an air atmosphere. The formation of LVOP–LVP was partly due to the transformation of LVP to LVOP from the surface to the interior of the particles, and the valence state of the V element was changed from +4 to +3 from the outside to the inside of the particles. The LVOP–LVP composite synthesized for 2 h in air shows the best electrochemical performance with a discharge capacity of 132.8 mA h g−1 at 45 mA g−1 in a potential range of 3.0–4.5 V, and the capacity was 126.8 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. The charge–discharge profiles of the LVOP–LVP sample synthesized for 2 h at a different current density in a potential range of 3.0–4.5 V are shown in Fig. 14a. It can be seen that the LVOP–LVP cells exhibit four plateaus, with three plateaus for LVP and the other one for LVOP. Fig. 14b shows the TEM image of the LVOP–LVP (2 h) composite. Two kinds of lattice fringes corresponding to LVOP (I) and LVP (II) co-exist in the composites. The lattice fringe of LVOP with an interplanar spacing of 2.60 Å is in accordance with the (−212) lattice plane, and the other 2.60 Å fringe corresponds to the (131) lattice plane of LVP. The HRTEM images provide a clear picture of the coexistence of three phases: LVOP, LVP and amorphous carbon, which form a multi-layered core–shell structure where LVP is the core, the 1 nm-sized amorphous carbon is the external shell, and LVOP is the internal shell.

Just like LFP–LMO hybrid cathode materials, two atmospheres (air and inert) are required to obtain LVOP–LVP composites. Two atmospheres usually increase the complexity of the experiment and may be hard to control.
LiCoO2–LiMn2O4
As LCO has a higher electric conductivity than LMO, it is possible to improve the rate capability of LMO. In order to enhance the rate capability of LMO, Park et al.125 prepared an LCO–LMO composite. The surfaces of LMO particles were coated with LCO by a sol–gel method. After surface coating, the LCO-coated LMO showed a higher discharge capacity of 120 mA h g−1 than the as-received LMO (115 mA h g−1), because LCO has a higher capacity than LMO. Besides, a serious of LCO–LMO composites have been successfully synthesized in recent years, and they show excellent performance in some respects.126–129
Conclusions and perspectives
Hybrid cathode materials are a composite consisting of two or more cathode materials and have been reported a lot in recent years. Current research focuses mainly on LFP–LVP hybrid cathode materials, since the advantages of LFP or LVP are really attractive. However, compared to single cathode materials, there is less systematic research on the technological innovation of hybrid cathode materials presently. In particular, the development of their theoretical study is slower because the synthesis of hybrid cathode materials have many internal and external influential factors.
Further, more work is still needed to be done to achieve the commercialization of hybrid cathode materials. Challenges and problems still exist in their research, such as the mechanism of mixing, doping, the best mixing methods, how to get an optimal proportion, how to calculate current density in the charge–discharge process, how to ensure uniformity, and so on. Further work should pay more attention to the synthesis mechanism and mixing process, because selecting which step in which to mix has a great effect on electrochemical performance. In the future, researchers should also study carefully each cathode and consider the possibilities before synthesizing hybrid cathode materials. Besides, the mixing of three or more cathode materials still needs to be studied. With the deepening of research, we believe that all these problems will be resolved.
