    , Accepted 12th July 2016First published on 13th July 2016AbstractIn the design of high performance conjugated copolymers, π-spacer plays one of the most important roles in finely manipulating photovoltaic properties of the polymers. However, up to now, little attention has been paid to functionalize the π-spacer. In this work, a novel D–A conjugated copolymer PBTI3T-S, with 3-(decylthio)thiophene as the π-spacer, is designed and synthesized. The introduction of a modified π-spacer has little influence on the absorption spectrum and band gap of the polymer. However, it is found that the modified π-spacer could create a noncovalent attractive interaction between neighboring moieties, resulting in good planarity and decreased π–π stacking distance in comparison to its analogue PBTI3T with decyl substitution on the π-spacers. More interestingly, the face-on population of crystallite orientation is significantly enhanced. Thus, the hole mobility of the PBTI3T-S/PC71BM blend is 1.29 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is one order of magnitude higher than that of the PBTI3T/PC71BM blend (1.15 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). The PBTI3T-S device provides a higher PCE of 7.14%, while the optimized PBTI3T device provides 6.51%. Impressively, the PCEs of the PBTI3T-S device can remain above 7% without substantial loss as the active layer thickness increases up to ∼270 nm, while the PCE reduces to 5.70% for the PBTI3T. These results demonstrate that the introduction of an alkylthio chain modified π-spacer would be an effective way to further improve the device performance and provide a guideline for molecular engineering towards the application of the roll to roll printing technique.
1. Introduction
Over the past decade, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have gained much attention due to their strong potential in the fabrication of low-cost, light-weight, flexible, and portable solar panels via high-throughput printing techniques.1–3 The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure based on conjugated polymers as donors and fullerene derivatives as acceptors has been demonstrated to be the most effective device architecture for PSCs.4 Among various donor polymers for BHJ PSCs, D–A copolymers are particularly interesting due to their convenience for tailoring the energy levels, band gaps, and carrier mobility.5–8 Up to now, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have been significantly improved and PCEs of 9%–11% have been achieved.9–11 Meanwhile, advance progress has been made in high-throughput techniques, such as roll-to-roll processing and inkjet-printing, for large-scale production of PSCs.12,13 One of the prerequisites in the fabrication of large-scale PSCs via these techniques is that the thickness of the active layers must be over 200 nm in order to afford a more uniform and pinhole-free film to guarantee reproducibility and reduce the loss of PCEs at a high printing speed.14,15 However, a majority of highly efficient donor materials provide optimal performance with typically rather thin films (ca. 100 nm),16,17 and most of the device efficiencies are severely sensitive to the active layer thickness. With increasing active layer thickness, transport resistance, charge accumulation, charge recombination and transit time are significantly enhanced due to the low hole mobility and/or unfavorable crystalline orientation of these polymers, leading to inferior fill factor (FF) and PCEs.18 So far, lots of efforts have been directed towards tuning the energy levels, hole mobility and crystalline orientation of D–A copolymers in order to fulfill the prerequisites of a future large-scale printing process.19,20 Nevertheless, only a few D–A conjugated polymers have been developed that can be applied in PSCs with thick active layers to afford high photovoltaic performance.15,21,22
The introduction of a π-spacer is one of the most effective strategies to modulate the molecular geometry, absorption, carrier mobility and photovoltaic properties of the copolymers.23,24 Despite its importance, the exploration of π-spacer side chains of copolymers has largely lagged behind in comparison with the considerable efforts devoted to developing new designs for side chains appended on the electron-donating/accepting units.25 Nearly all studies focus on introducing different π-spacers, such as thiophene, selenophene, furan, benzene, and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT), to reduce the steric hindrance or attaching different bulky chains onto π-spacers to tune the solubility of the polymers.26,27 Although a few studies have paid attention to the effect of side chains,28–30 there are far less reports on the functionalized side chain of π-spacers which would benefit further fine tuning of the molecular structure and developing desirable materials to improve the device efficiency. Thus, it is a challenge to explore novel strategies to carefully functionalize the side chain of the π-spacer in order to optimize the photovoltaic parameters, and construct a correlation between the side chains of π-spacers and photovoltaic properties for further developing highly efficient materials to satisfy the requirements of large-scale production. There is no doubt that the nature of these side chains attached on the π-spacers not only affects the solubility, geometry and molecular weights of the polymers but also influences the energy levels, charge transport and crystalline orientation, which are key to further enhance the performance of PSCs. As reported, electron-donating side chains, such as alkoxy and alkylthio groups, usually contribute to the increase of electron density of conjugated copolymers’ main chains through the connecting moieties.31,32 Generally, the stronger electron-donating nature of the alkoxy than the alkyl or alkylthio group results in relatively higher highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lower open circuit voltage (Voc).28 In 2012, Lee et al. reported a new dialkylthio substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) electron donating unit and its homopolymer-based device displayed a high Voc of 0.99 V and a PCE of 4.0%.33 In 2014, Li et al. introduced an alkylthio substituent on the conjugated thiophene side chains of BDT units and synthesized a new 2D-conjugated polymer (PBDT-S-TT), with a high PCE of 8.42%.16
Inspired by these intriguing results, we speculated that the alkylthio group is one of the best choices to modify the π-spacers, which would endow the polymers with unique photovoltaic properties. A novel copolymer based on 2,2′-bithiophene-3,3′-dicarboximide (BTI)-thiophene (T) was designed and synthesized, named poly[N-(2-hexyldecyl)-2,2′-bithiophene-3,3′-dicarboximide-alt-5,5-(2,5-bis(3-(decylthio)thiophene-2-yl)-thiophene)] (PBTI3T-S). For comparison, its analogue poly[N-(2-hexyldecyl)-2,2′-bithiophene-3,3′-dicarboximide-alt-5,5-(2,5-bis(3-decylthiophene-2-yl)-thiophene)] (PBTI3T) with a decyl modified π-spacer was also prepared according to the reported procedure.34 The effect of incorporating the decorated π-spacer with decylthio side chains on the key parameters of the PBTI3T-S, such as energy levels, hole mobility, crystalline orientation, and molecular geometry, was systemically investigated. These results showed that the introduction of decylthio modified π-spacers could construct the S (BTI)⋯S (decylthio) noncovalent interaction with neighboring moieties, resulting in a smaller dihedral angle between BTI and an adjacent thiophene which would benefit improvement in π–π stacking and hole mobility. More importantly, the population of face-on crystallite is enlarged, which facilitates the effective charge transfer in a photovoltaic device. As a result, the device based on PBTI3T-S as a donor and PC71BM as an acceptor demonstrates a higher PCE of 7.14%, while the PCE of PBTI3T devices under the optimized conditions is 6.51%. Impressively, the device efficiencies of PBTI3T-S are all above 7% as active layer thickness varies from 115 nm to 271 nm, indicating that the PBTI3T-S device is relatively insensitive to film thickness as compared with its analogue, PBTI3T.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Polymer synthesis and characterization
The detailed synthetic process of PBTI3T-S is described in the Experimental section. The chemical structures and synthetic routes for the two polymers are shown in Scheme 1, respectively. Polymer PBTI3T was synthesized according to the reported literature.34 Both PBTI3T-S and PBTI3T were polymerized via the Stille coupling reaction with Pd2(dba)3 and P(o-tol)3 as the catalyst system in toluene at 112 °C. At the end of polymerization, 0.2 ml 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene and 0.3 ml 2-bromothiophene were successively added as end-capping reagents. Polymers were purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, hexane, CH2Cl2 and chloroform. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) for PBTI3T-S and PBTI3T is 37.6 kDa and 51.9 kDa with Mw/Mn of 2.7 and 3.2, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S9†) results showed that the decomposition temperature (Td) at 5% weight loss of PBTI3T is 424 °C, whereas that of PBTI3T-S is 371 °C. Nevertheless, the decomposition temperatures of the two polymers are much higher than any annealing and practical application temperatures for PSCs.

2.2 Optical properties

Fig. 1a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of PBTI3T-S in chlorobenzene (CB) solutions and in thin solid films. For clear comparison, the absorption spectra of PBTI3T under identical conditions are also shown and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 1. In the solid state, the absorption spectrum of the PBTI3T-S was red-shifted ca. 10 nm as compared with PBTI3T, indicating that the introduction of decylthio side chains produces slight influence on the band gap. Notably, the low energy absorption shoulder peak at 660 nm could be partially observed even at a solution temperature of 100 °C for PBTI3T-S (Fig. 1b). Compared with the absorption spectra of PBTI3T (Fig. 1c), where the shoulder peak totally disappeared at a solution temperature of 100 °C, the greater difficulty in completely dis-aggregating PBTI3T-S in CB solution suggests a planarization of the backbone and more effective packing of PBTI3T-S, which might arise from the stronger non-covalent interactions among PBTI3T-S,7,35 as discussed below. The optical band gap of PBTI3T-S calculated from the absorption onset (λonset) of the film is 1.79 eV.

2.3 Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the two copolymers were investigated by performing cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. The HOMO values were calculated on the basis of onsets of the oxidation potentials with a calibrated Ag/Ag+ (vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium) as the reference electrode. The oxidation onsets of PBTI3T-S and PBTI3T were observed at +1.16 V and +1.21 V and the corresponding HOMO energy levels were estimated to be −5.54 eV and −5.59 eV, respectively (Fig. 1d). The slightly higher HOMO energy level of PBTI3T-S arises from the weak electron-donating ability of the alkylthio side chain. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the incorporation of alkylthio side chains could lead to non-covalent interactions, altering the conjugation length and modifying the energy levels, and this conjecture would be examined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations discussed below. The LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −3.74 eV and −3.77 eV for PBTI3T-S and PBTI3T, respectively, by combining the HOMO values and optical band gaps of the films (Table 1).
2.4 Theoretical calculations
Theoretical calculations were made to gain deeper insights into the effect of alkylthio side chains on the molecular structure and electronic properties of the polymers. DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level were performed on the repeating units, and trimers of PBTI3T-S and PBTI3T,34 the decyl and decylthio side chains were replaced by methyl and methylthio groups for simplicity of the computation. For both PBTI3T-S and PBTI3T, the electron density in the HOMO wave function was delocalized over the entire conjugated backbone, whereas the electron density associated with the LUMO was mainly localized over the BTI units (Fig. S10†). As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the energy-minimized dihedral angle was ∼15° between the BTI segment and the alkylthiophene in each repeating unit of PBTI3T. In contrast, the computed dihedral angle was decreased to ∼8.3° between the planes of BTI and alkylthiothiophene blocks in each repeating unit of PBTI3T-S. The results suggested that the introduction of decylthio side chains on the thiophene ring could construct the S (BTI)⋯S (alkylthio) attractive interaction and minimize the dihedral angle between BTI and adjacent thiophene, which would provide a higher rigid backbone conformation in the solid state. Furthermore, the trimer of PBTI3T-S displayed a more planar backbone conformation compared with the trimer of PBTI3T (Fig. 2c and d), which was expected to facilitate the π-electron delocalization and enhance the intermolecular interaction, hole mobility, and photovoltaic performance.36,37

2.5 GIWAXS studies and SCLC
To further understand the influence of the functionalized substituent on the crystallinity and molecular orientation of the polymers in the film state which correlate with the hole mobility and device performance, two-dimensional grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) measurements were carried out to examine the properties of the neat polymer films (Fig. 3). As shown in the 2D scattering pattern of PBTI3T, pronounced reflection peaks of (100) and (200) in the out of plane direction were observed in the pristine film, corresponding to the edge-on crystallite with d100 = 20.73 Å. For PBTI3T-S, the π–π stacking and lamellar diffractions appeared on the qz = 17.80 nm−1 and qxy = 2.87 nm−1 axis, respectively, indicating that the population of the face-on crystallite was increased, which may facilitate effective charge transport in the vertical direction.38 It should also be noted that the π-stacking (qz = 17.80 nm−1, 010) diffraction of the PBTI3T-S was more prominent than the PBTI3T film. These results implied that the introduction of decylthio side chains onto the flanked thiophenes not only optimized the molecular orientation but also effectively enhanced crystallization of PBTI3T-S.
 Fig. 3  Two-dimensional (2D) grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) images. Neat PBTI3T-S (a) and PBTI3T (b) films. 
Another interesting feature was that the values of π–π stacking distance (010) extracted from the GIWAXS profile were 3.53 Å and 3.56 Å for PBTI3T-S and PBTI3T, respectively. Therefore, by replacing the decyl substituent with decylthio, the π–π stacking distance was reduced, indicating that the crystallites of the PBTI3T-S polymer chains were much tighter, which correlated well with DFT calculation results and would contribute to the device performance.38–40 Thus, it could be concluded that through appending the functionalized side chains onto π-spacers, not only the crystallinity was enhanced by constructing the intra-chain non-covalent interactions but also the face-on orientation of crystallites could be increased, which is favorable for effective charge transport, large short circuit current (Jsc) and high PCE.
The hole mobility of the polymer/PC71BM blend films was investigated via the space charge limited current (SCLC) model with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au/Al. The typical current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics are depicted in Fig. S11.† As expected, the measured hole mobility of the PBTI3T-S/PC71BM blend was 1.29 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was one order of magnitude higher than that of the PBTI3T/PC71BM blend (1.15 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). This result indicates that the primary higher crystallinity and population of the face-on orientation crystallite of PBTI3T-S contribute to the out of plane charge transport across the film.
2.6 Photovoltaic properties
Devices with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al were fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic performance of the polymers under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The typical J–V curves of the device are shown in Fig. 4 and the corresponding performance parameters are listed in Tables S1 and S2.† It was found that the PBTI3T-S device directly spin-coated from a polymer and PC71BM (polymer/PC71BM = 1/1, w/w) mixed chlorobenzene (CB) solution displayed a PCE of 2.75%. The relatively low Jsc and FF considerably limited the device performance. Thus, the performances were optimized by varying the polymer/PC71BM ratios, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) content, and introducing post treatment. The optimized PSC devices were finally achieved with a D/A ratio of 1:2 (w/w), 2% DIO (v/v), and methanol treatment. As shown in Fig. 4c, the PBTI3T-S device displayed a maximum PCE of 7.14% with Jsc of 13.51 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.82 V and FF of 64.46%. For comparison, the photovoltaic device based on PBTI3T was also prepared under the optimal conditions in our lab.34 It could be observed that the PBTI3T device exhibited an optimal PCE of 6.51% with a Jsc of 11.70 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.84 V and FF of 66.21% (Fig. 4c), which was comparable to the reported literature (7.02%). The difference (7.02% vs. 6.51%) may be related to the preparation process of the device and reproducibility of batch-to-batch for polymers. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the PSCs based on the polymers is shown in Fig. 4d. The EQE curve of the PBTI3T-S device covered a broader photo-to-current response in the range of 300-750 nm with the maximum EQE value of 74% at ca. 480 nm. In contrast, the EQE value of the PBTI3T device was lower in the whole wavelength range and the maximum value was 68% (at ca. 430 nm), which agreed well with its inferior Jsc. The integrated current density calculated from EQE curves of both devices was consistent with Jsc values measured from J–V curves within 3% deviation, indicating that the attained device performances in this work were reliable.

2.7 Film morphology
It is known that photovoltaic performances are greatly affected by the morphology of the active layers. In order to understand the effect of morphological changes on the device performance, PBTI3T-S/PC71BM films were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 5, the pristine blend film (without DIO as an additive) of PBTI3T-S/PC71BM exhibited large toroid-shaped domains with a feature size of hundreds of nanometers, which reduced the probability for exciton dissociation due to limited donor/acceptor interfacial areas, leading to low Jsc, FF and PCE values.41 In contrast, the PBTI3T-S/PC71BM blend with DIO as an additive showed a clear morphological change, forming well-distributed nano-fibrillar structures where a bicontinuous interpenetrating network might be well formed.42 The morphology of the blend film treated with methanol was also characterized by TEM. However, there was no observed change in the TEM image (Fig. 5c) compared with the blend treated with DIO, hinting that the effect of the methanol treatment did not originate from the reconstruction of the morphology. The increased internal electric field and surface potential are believed to contribute to the improved device performance.43 The morphological evolution of PBTI3T/PC71BM blend films upon DIO or DIO/methanol treatment is almost the same with the PBTI3T-S/PC71BM blends, as shown in Fig. 5d–f.

To give deeper insights into the effect of alkylthio side chain on the device performance, the devices with different active layer thicknesses were also characterized, as shown in Fig. 6. With increasing active layer thickness, the Jsc was generally improved due to the enhancement of light absorption, while the FF was expected to be reduced by the increased charge recombination. In this work, a series of active layers ranging from ∼100 nm to ∼330 nm were prepared by manipulating the spin-coating speed. As shown in Table 2, PBTI3T device efficiencies substantially decreased from 6.51% to 5.70% when the active layer thickness increased from 155 nm to 268 nm because the sharply decreased FF outweighed the gained Jsc. In contrast, the PBTI3T-S device afforded one excellent feature of insensitivity to the change in active layer thickness and device efficiencies could be maintained above 7% as the active layer thickness increased from 115 nm to 271 nm. For the PBTI3T-S device, the FF could remain above 60% for a broad range (115 nm to 334 nm) of active layer thickness, revealing that the charge recombination in the thick active layers was not so significant, due to the excellent charge transport properties. This insensitivity of device performance to the active layer thickness makes PBTI3T-S as one of the most promising photovoltaic materials compatible with commercial production processes, such as roll-to-roll printing.

3. Conclusions
In summary, a novel BTI based D–A copolymer was designed and synthesized by incorporating a decylthio modified π-spacer into the backbone for improving the photovoltaic performance. It was found that the introduction of a modified π-spacer could create a noncovalent attractive interaction between neighboring moieties via dipole–dipole interactions, resulting in good planarity and decreased π–π stacking distance for PBTI3T-S in comparison to its counterpart with decyl substitution on the π-spacers. More importantly, we observed that the PBTI3T-S polymer exhibited a greater tendency to form face-on orientation, which contributed a lot to the hole mobility in the vertical direction of the films. As a consequence, the PBTI3T-S/PC71BM blend showed relatively higher hole mobility of 1.29 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared with 1.15 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for its counterpart PBTI3T/PC71BM blend. The PBTI3T-S device exhibited a PCE of 7.14%, which was 10% higher than that of the PBTI3T device. Surprisingly, the PBTI3T-S device could preserve a PCE over 7.0% without substantial loss as the thickness of the active layer increased up to 271 nm, implying that PBTI3T-S was a promising candidate for mass production technology of PSCs. These results demonstrated that this finding would be an effective strategy to guide the molecular engineering towards a large-scale printing process and high efficiency for PSCs.

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 MHz spectrometer in CDCl3 with TMS as the internal standard. UV absorption measurement was carried out on a JASCO V-500 UV-vis spectrophotometer, equipped with a Peltier temperature control accessory. The electrochemical properties of the polymer films were performed on a CHI600D electrochemical instrument in anhydrous acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 under nitrogen. Tetrakis-(n-butyl)ammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) (0.1 M) was employed as the electrolyte. A glassy carbon electrode, a Ag/AgNO3 electrode, and a Pt wire were used as the working, reference, and counter electrode, respectively. Polymer films were spin-coated onto the glassy carbon working electrode from a chlorobenzene solution at 8 mg ml−1. High temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements were performed on a PL-GPC 220 instrument. Samples were dissolved in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) at 130 °C with shaking for 1 h. The obtained molecular weight was calibrated with polystyrene narrow standards. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a METTLER TOLEDO TGA/DSC1/1100 LF at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under an N2 atmosphere. 2D-GIXRD patterns were obtained at BL14B1 at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) (λ = 1.24 Å). The TEM images were acquired with a JEOL JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. The J–V characteristics of photovoltaic devices were measured by a Keithley-2400 source meter in a glove box using a solar simulator (SAN-EI, XES-70S1) at AM 1.5 G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The IPCE of these devices was measured in an atmospheric environment, using a calibrated silicon solar cell as a reference.

4.3 Fabrication and characterization of PSCs
PSCs were fabricated as a conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al. The indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were cleaned in sequence with detergent, deionized water, isopropyl alcohol and acetone. After the cleaned ITO substrates were treated with UV ozone for 30 minutes, the substrates were covered with a 30 nm thick layer of PEDOT:PSS by spin coating. After annealing at 150 °C for 20 min, the substrates were transferred to a nitrogen glove box. Polymer/PC71BM solutions (8 mg ml−1) were dissolved in CB solution with or without DIO as an additive and then spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer to form the active layer. The devices were completed by evaporation of a layer of LiF (8 Å)/Al (120 nm) as a cathode for the conventional polymer solar cells. The active layer area for each device was 0.09 cm2. The hole mobilities were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method on a hole-only device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:P71CBM/Au(30 nm)/Al(120 nm). The SCLC hole mobility was calculated according to the following equationln(I/V2) = 0.89β(V/L)1/2 + ln(9με0εS/(8L3))where I is the current, β is the field activation factor, V is the internal potential, L is the active layer thickness, μ is the hole mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free charge, ε is the relative permittivity, and S is the device area.
