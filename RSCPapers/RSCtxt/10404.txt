    , Accepted 23rd January 2014First published on 27th January 2014AbstractSolar cells are generally optimised for operation under AM1.5 100 mW cm−2 conditions. This is also typically done for polymer solar cells. However, one of the entry markets for this emerging technology is portable electronics. For this market, the spectral shape and intensity of typical illumination conditions deviate considerably from the standard test conditions (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2, at 25 °C). The performance of polymer solar cells is strongly dependent on the intensity and spectral shape of the light source. For this reason the cells should be optimised for the specific application. Here a theoretical model is presented that describes the light intensity dependence of P3HT:[C60]PCBM solar cells. It is based on the Shockley diode equation, combined with a metal–insulator–metal model. In this way the observed light intensity dependence of P3HT:[C60]PCBM solar cells can be described using a 1-diode model, allowing fast optimization of polymer solar cells and module design.
1. Introduction
The power conversion efficiency of polymer solar cells is steadily increasing and has recently reached values of over 10% for size up to 1 cm,1,2 increasing the potential of polymer solar cells in different commercial applications. These types of cells will on a short term not be used for large scale applications, but will probably enter the market first as energy generating units in portable devices and cheap electronic devices.
When used in such applications, the polymer solar cells will face different light conditions, both in light intensity and in the spectrum, for example, in indoor applications where the different light sources have different spectral shapes and intensities. As the efficiency of solar cells depends on both light intensity and the spectrum, the design of the cells must be optimized for the specific light conditions that occur for the specific application. This is where modelling can play an important role.
Modelling polymer solar cells has increasingly gained interest in the last decade. Several device physics and optical models have been reported3–7 that accurately describe the observed device performance on the cell level. These models do not take into account the effects of series resistance caused by the metallization and external circuit, and thus describe the intrinsic cell performance. Such device physics and optical modelling can be used to determine the accurate device structure with respect to layer thicknesses in the device. For optimization of the metallization for the electrodes, series resistance effects and shadow loss due to the metallization must be included. Such models have recently been reported by several groups.8,9 All these models need intrinsic current–voltage (IV) characteristics as inputs, to describe the diode characteristics of the cell. This can be based on an experimental IV curve which has been corrected for the series resistance and shadow losses in the measurement, or it can be the result of a device physics model. It has been shown previously for P3HT:[C60]PCBM solar cells10 that finite element modelling (FEM) is able to describe the performance of cells, using the diode properties or IV characteristics of a small cell as input parameters. However, it turned out that this only holds for one light intensity. If a different light intensity is used, new diode properties or IV characteristics for that specific light intensity are needed.
For modelling of inorganic solar cells often a 1-diode or the Shockley model11 is used and most of the available or commercial software for solar cells is based on this type of model. The standard Shockley equation is not sufficient to model the operation of polymer solar cells. For this reason the Shockley equation was extended.12–15 Although the cells could to a large extent be described using this model, it did not always generate accurate results. Often the light intensity dependence is not correctly described. So in order to model the performance of the intrinsic properties of polymer solar cells, including the light intensity dependence, a sophisticated device physics model is needed but for optimization of the metallization a simple 1-diode model is preferred that enables the use of standard software.
In this paper we combine the 1-diode model with the device physics model for polymer solar cells of the Blom group.4 Using this approach we are able to describe the light intensity dependence of various P3HT:[C60]PCBM solar cells. This opens the way for fast optimization of different polymer solar cells and module designs.
2. Experimental
Three series of large area ITO-free organic solar cell devices were prepared. The devices consisted of the following layer stack: current collecting metal grids/high conductivity PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:[C60]PCBM/LiF:Al. The Mo/Al/Mo grids were prepared on glass substrates by sputtering. The thickness of the aluminium layer was 100 nm resulting in Mo/Al/Mo grids with heights (thicknesses) of 10/100/10 nm. The current collecting grids have a pattern of parallel lines with a spacing (pitch) of 2 mm and the width of the lines is 100 μm. Such grids provide 5% of surface coverage. All devices had rectangular shape (see Fig. 1), a width of 2.4 cm and the length between 1 and 6 cm for each series of devices. The devices were prepared on 6 glass substrates and each substrate contained 6 devices with the length from 1 to 6 cm.
 Fig. 1  Schematic presentation of the device layout used in this paper. Grey rectangles indicate the metal contacts and the grey lines the metal fingers of the top contact. Distance between the lines (heart to heart) is 2 mm. 
High conductivity Orgacon™ PEDOT:PSS from Agfa-Gevaert was inkjet printed on top of substrates with the current collecting grids. For inkjet printing of PEDOT:PSS a Spectra Galaxy 256 print-head was used. The thickness of PEDOT:PSS, with a sheet conductivity of 200 S cm−1, was 100 nm. It provides a sheet resistance for PEDOT:PSS layers of 500 Ohm sq−1.
Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) (purchased from Plextronics, Plexcore OS 2100) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (99%, purchased from Solenne BV) were dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene with a mixing ratio of 1:1 by weight and a concentration of 2 wt% of each. The solution was stirred for 3 h at 80 °C. The photoactive layer was obtained by spin coating the blend at 1000 rpm for 30 seconds, which corresponds to a thickness of 220 nm. The thicknesses of the films were measured using a Dektak profilometer. The experiments were performed in a clean-room environment in an ambient atmosphere. The metal cathode (1 nm LiF, 100 nm Al) was thermally evaporated in a vacuum chamber through a shadow mask. The finished OPV devices were encapsulated with Holst Centre thin film barrier. For each type of solar cells at least 3–5 identical devices were prepared. Current–voltage curves were measured under simulated AM1.5 global solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2), using a WXS-300S-50 solar simulator (WACOM Electric Co.)
3. Finite element model
A finite element model was developed that describes the polymer solar cell.16 The device is treated as a quasi 2-dimensional system and can be described by the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 2. At the top in grey are the metal fingers with their resistance, in green is the contact resistance between the metal fingers and the PEDOT:PSS, in purple is the PEDOT:PSS layer with its resistance, in red are the photodiodes of the active layer including shunt resistance and at the bottom in grey is the back contact layer with its resistance.
 Fig. 2  Schematic drawing showing the equivalent circuit for the model. At the top in grey the top contact, in green the contact resistance between the top contact and the PEDOT layer (purple), the photoactive layer (red part) and at the bottom in grey the back contact. 
The active layer is described by a 1-diode equation with its diode parameters, photocurrent density (Jph), dark saturation current density (J0), the diode ideality factor (n), and shunt resistance (Rshunt). The metal grid is coupled to the photo-active layer via the contact resistance, whereas the top of the photo-active layer is coupled to the back metal contact via the diode properties of the photo-active layer. Iterations are done to make the voltages between the layers consistent. The model calculates the voltage distribution for a certain applied voltage by solving the coupled Poisson equations using a Finite Element Method with a spatial resolution of about 2500 elements per cell.
The model layout can be adapted to suit the specific experimental situation. In this paper two different layouts were used. The layout shown in Fig. 1 and the situation shown in Fig. 3 which shows a cell and its metal contacts as well as the interconnection from the top contact of one cell to the back contact of the next cell in a module. It is assumed that the ZnO is not contributing to the lateral transport and that its contribution to the resistance can be neglected. In this paper we refer to the situation shown in Fig. 3 as a single cell module. It is based on monolithic interconnection of individual cells using scribes for the isolation between the photoactive layer and the metal of the interconnection (P1), isolation between the metal of the interconnection and the photoactive layer of the next cell (P3) and to open the way for the metal contact between the front side of one cell and the back side of the other cell (P2).
 Fig. 3  Schematic drawing of the device structure. Red: active layer, purple: PEDOT layer, light blue bottom: electron transport/hole blocking layer (ETL/HBL), here ZnO; ignored in this calculation, gray bottom: BC back contact, gray top: metal fingers and interconnection. Green: isolation layer. P1: scribe for the isolation between the photoactive layer and the metal of the interconnection, P3 scribe for isolation between the metal of the interconnection and the photoactive layer of the next cell and P2 scribe to open the way for the metal contact between the front side of one cell and back side of the other cell. 
Furthermore it is assumed that the isolation scribe (P1) is good enough so that there will be no direct current flow between the active layer and the metal of the interconnection. For this reason the isolation and photo-active material between the isolation and the metal of the interconnection were omitted in the model.
4. Results
Current–voltage measurements were performed on cells with different cell lengths and under different illumination intensities. The larger cells will have a larger series resistance than the smaller cells, as the current in the cell is higher and the distances over which the current has to travel before it is collected are larger. It can thus be expected that there will be a voltage distribution in the larger cells due to the series resistance, and as a result not all parts of the cell will be subjected to the same applied voltage. So fitting a large cell to a 1-diode model will not give the intrinsic diode parameters, but effective diode parameters. For this reason we first focused on the smallest, 1 cm cell, as it is expected that the series resistance for this cell has a negligible influence on the voltage of the cell.
As mentioned in the introduction IV curves of inorganic solar cells are often fitted with a generalized Shockley equation: (1)where J0 is the dark saturation current density, q the elementary charge, Rs the series resistance, V the applied voltage, n the diode ideality factor, k Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, Jph the light induced current density, and Rshunt the shunt resistance.
In this work we also fitted the IV characteristics of the P3HT:[C60]PCBM cells at different light intensities with eqn (1) in order to determine the series resistance contribution of the 1 cm long cell. Next, the measured IV characteristics were corrected for the series resistance and the known shadow losses from the metallization. The resulting IV-curve was fitted with the Shockley equation without series resistance.
The resulting diode parameters are shown in Fig. 4, together with a linear fit to the data. As can be seen Jph is linearly dependent on the light intensity, as has been seen before for P3HT:[C60]PCBM cells and which is consistent with the Shockley model. Also 1/Rshunt and the ideality factor n show a linear dependence on light intensity. The dependence of the shunt resistance on light intensity has been reported before for polymer solar cells and was attributed to photo-induced recombination events. The light intensity dependence of n is not consistent with the Shockley model which assumes a constant n, and also assumes a constant J0 with respect to light intensity. But Fig. 4 shows that J0 increases with light intensity. Clearly, the Shockley model as given in eqn (1) is not able to predict the light intensity dependence of the J–V characteristics of P3HT:[C60]PCBM solar cells.
 Fig. 4  Measured and fitted relation of Jph, J0 (no fit), n and 1/Rshuntversus light intensity. 
It has been shown before that the light intensity of the Voc for polymer solar cells is accurately described by Koster et al. with a model based on a metal–insulator–metal (MIM) model.4 The MIM model treats the donor–acceptor blend as an effective semiconductor with the transport of electrons (holes) occurring in its conduction (valence) band. The expression for the Voc of that model is given by (2)in which Egap is the effective bandgap of the cell (HOMO–LUMO difference), q the elementary charge, P the electron–hole pair dissociation probability, kr the bimolecular recombination rate, NCV the effective density of states of valence and conduction bands, Ge–h the generation rate of bound electron–hole pairs in the photoactive layer (PAL). In eqn (2) only the generation rate of bound electron–hole pairs depends on the light intensity (Iill) and this relation is assumed to be linear:

G
e–h(Iill) = Ge–h(1 sun)*Iill. Thus we can rewrite eqn (2) as: (3)with (4)and S times kT/q is the slope of a graph of Vocversus the logarithm of the light intensity as shown in Fig. 5. S depends on the material of the photo-active layer and gives an indication of the type of recombination in the layer.
 Fig. 5  Left: measured light intensity dependence of Voc (black squares) and a fit of eqn (3) to the data (red line). Right: measured J0 (black squares) and a fit to the data using eqn (6) (red line). 
The equation for the Voc that follows from the Shockley equation is given by (5) To incorporate the MIM model into the Shockley equation the Voc of eqn (3) is kept equal to the Voc of eqn (5). By solving this equation for J0, an expression for J0 can be found that is consistent with the MIM model: (6)where a value of 1.25 was taken for S as was determined previously for P3HT:[C60]PCBM.17,18
The measured Voc and J0 as a function of light intensity were fitted with eqn (3) and (6) respectively. For the fit the measured linear intensity dependencies of Jph and n as shown in Fig. 4 were used and a literature value of 1.0 eV was taken for Egap. Only parameter C was fitted. The results are shown in Fig. 5.
As can be seen, both Voc and J0 are very well described by their respective formulas, when using the linear light intensity dependencies of n and Jph. The dashed line in the J0 graph indicates the result when a constant n is taken. Clearly this does not match the experimentally observed light intensity dependence of J0. The value of C that results from the fit of the Voc is 5.0 × 106. For the J0 fit a value of 4.0 × 106 is found for C. These values are close to the value of 5.8 × 106 for C that is obtained when using the literature values of Table 1 in eqn (5). The difference may lie in the uncertainty of the literature values but also the cells used in this work might have a somewhat different morphology leading to slightly different values.

So the light intensity dependence of the P3HT:[C60]PCBM cells can be explained by the observed linear dependencies of Jph, Rsh and n, and the derived relation for J0. The question that remains is, why is n depending on light intensity?
It is known that the current in polymer solar cells can be described by J = qL(G − L)(7)
In which L is the layer thickness, G is the generation term and R is the recombination term. The latter contains recombination between injected (dark) carriers, photogenerated carriers, and their cross-terms and is given by R = kr [(nd + nph)(pd + pph)](8)
Substitution of eqn (8) into eqn (7) gives J = qGL − kr(ndpd + nphpph + nphpd + ndpph) = Jph − krndpd − kr(nphpph + nphpd + ndpph)(9)in which nph (pph) are the photogenerated electron (hole) densities, and nd (pd) are the dark electron (hole) densities.
The first term, qGL, is the photocurrent and is equal to the Jph in eqn (1). The second term is similar to the second term in eqn (1) as it describes the injection of dark carriers.
So only if the terms in the third term are negligible, the superposition of photo- and dark current, as assumed in the Shockley equation, holds (we ignore here the contribution of the shunt resistance, as this is similar in both models). In general however, in polymer solar cells the photo-recombination terms will not be negligible, resulting in a deviation from the Shockley equation. The cross terms depend on intensity. The nphnph term is quadratically dependent on light intensity as it depends on the square of photogenerated carrier densities, whereas the other terms depend linearly on light intensity. So the question is, can the Shockley equation be written with the intensity dependent parameters such that it resembles the intensity dependence of eqn (9), i.e. (10)with J0(Iill) from eqn (6) and n = n1 + n2 × Iill. First the expression for J0 and n was inserted in the left side of eqn (10) and a second order Taylor series around Iill = 1 was performed. Next the third order term was ignored and the constant terms, the terms linear with Iill and the terms quadratic in Iill, were collected. The expressions for the constants a, b and c are too large to display them in this paper, but using these expressions the current density could indeed be expressed in terms of Iill and Iill2 similar to the right side of eqn (10). To show the validity of the result, Fig. 6 shows the measured J–V curves at 2 different intensities together with the calculated result based on the Taylor series. As can be seen, the calculated curves nicely overlap the experimental curves.
 Fig. 6  Calculated and experimental J–V curves for two different illumination intensities. 
Another difference between organic and inorganic cells is the field dependence of the photogenerated current density in polymer solar cells as shown by Mihailetchi et al.22 for P3HT:[C60]PCBM solar cells. They showed very good agreement between experimental results and the calculated Jph as a function of the effective applied voltage (V0–V) using their device physics model including the field- and temperature-dependent generation rate G(E,T). This field dependence is typically plotted as Jphversus the effective applied voltage V0–V, where V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0. Jph is then determined as the current density under illumination plus the current density in the dark: Jph(V,Ill) = J + Jdark(11)
Substitution of eqn (10) gives: (12)
From eqn (12) it can be seen that Jph(V,Iill) ≠ Jph(Iill) because J0(Iill) ≠ J0(0) and n(Iill) ≠ n(0). So only if J0 and n would be constant with light intensity, Jph would be field independent. Fig. 7 shows the experimental Jph(V,Iill) versus V0–V together with the calculated Jph(V,Iill) from eqn (12). Again a good agreement between experiment and calculation is found.
 Fig. 7  Photon current density as function of the effective applied voltage for a 1 cm long cell at an illumination intensity of 1 sun. In red the experimental results, in black the calculation result using Jph = Jph − c. 
These results show that by adapting the diode parameters in the Shockley diode model such that they represent the MIM model, very good agreement is found between the model and experiments.
The light intensity dependencies were implemented in two models, an analytical model, that assumes that every part of the cell is subjected to the same voltage, and a distributed series resistance model as described by the FEM model above. The results are shown in Fig. 8 for different light intensities and finger lengths of 1 cm and 6 cm.
 Fig. 8  
IV-parameters as function of illumination intensity for a cell with a finger length of 1 cm and 6 cm. Shown are the calculation results for an analytical model (black), FEM model (red) and experimental results. 
As can be seen, the analytical model shows good agreement for the cell with fingers of 1 cm length, although the model starts to overestimate the FF and Pmpp for higher light intensities. This indicates that for such a short cell the series resistance does not result in a significant lateral voltage drop at low light intensities, but that series resistance effects reduce the power conversion efficiency under 1 sun conditions. The series resistance gives rise to a voltage drop over the cell which will at first affect the FF of the device. The FF for the short cell remains above 60%, having no influence on Jsc. However, for the long cell the FF drops much faster due to the higher current densities in this cell. Already at light intensities slightly over 0.3 sun, the FF drops below 40% and starts to affect the Jsc. The analytical model is not able to explain the behaviour of the FF and Jsc for the long cell at higher light intensities. The assumption that the whole cell is facing the same applied voltage clearly does not hold under these conditions. The voltage drop is so large that part of the cell is operating at Voc or even further, reducing the current density substantially. The FEM model on the other hand shows excellent agreement with the measured Jsc, showing that the model is able to predict both the light intensity dependence and the effect of the distributed series resistance. For these large cells an analytical model is not sufficient to give an accurate estimate of the performance and a FEM model should be used.
The FEM model including the light intensity dependence of the cells can be used to determine the optimum grid geometry for various light intensities. This is shown in Fig. 9 where the efficiency of the total area is plotted for light intensities varying from 0.2 to 1 sun, for cell lengths of 1 and 2 cm and pitches of 1.5, 2 and 2.5 mm. Table 2 gives the values for the diode parameters that were used in the calculation and Table 3 the values for the other parameters in the model.

For the 1 cm long device, the efficiency first increases with light intensity and then decreases for all pitches. Increasing the light intensity results in an increase in current density, which causes a decrease in the fill factor due to resistive losses. On the other hand, the Voc will increase with light intensity. These opposing mechanisms result in an optimum in efficiency around 0.5 sun. Increasing the cell length to 2 cm shifts the optimum to lower illumination intensity, as the resistive losses become larger, whereas the dependence of the Voc on light intensity remains the same. Fig. 9 also shows that the pitch can be optimized for light intensity. For the 2 cm long cell, the optimum pitch at 0.2 sun is 2.5 mm, whereas at 1 sun it is 1.5 mm. This clearly shows the need for optimization of grid patterns for different illumination intensities.
5. Conclusions
Here a model is described that is able to simulate the light intensity behaviour of P3HT:[C60]PCBM solar cells. The model is based on the Shockley diode model, but it includes light intensity dependencies of J0, n, and Rshunt. The dependencies are determined from a 1-diode model fit to measured IV curves, one at low light intensity and one at roughly 1 sun light intensity. A linear fit to n and 1/Rshuntversus light intensity gives the dependencies of n and Rshunt. For J0 a formula is derived using the expression of the Voc for polymer solar cells from Koster et al. This formula is based on material constants that have been derived previously for P3HT:[C60]PCBM solar cells. Using this approach the voltage dependence of the photon current density could also be described. The dependencies were implemented in a FEM model and show excellent agreement with experimental results for all light intensities and both short and long cells. This model was then used to show that the optimal pitch of a metal grid depends on the illumination intensity.
This opens the way for fast optimization of polymer solar cells and modules for different applications, performing under different light intensities.
