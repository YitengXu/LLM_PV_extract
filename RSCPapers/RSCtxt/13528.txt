Localized electric fields can be produced by the addition of Au nanoparticles, which can excite dye molecules more effectively than incident far-field light. The synergistic effect of surface plasmon resonance with constructed TiO2 nanostructures has been investigated, and was confirmed by optical spectroscopy, J–V characteristics, EIS analysis and OCVD measurements. When Au nanoparticles are incorporated into the constructed TiO2 spheres, the device achieves a power conversion efficiency of 6.62%, a 4.6% increase compared to the device based on constructed TiO2 spheres without plasmon resonant Au nanoparticles, and a 17.4% increase compared to that without any treatment.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted extensive attention as a promising alternative to traditional silicon-based photovoltaic devices, due to their high power conversion efficiency and low production cost.1,2 Since O'Regan and Grätzel initially reported their breakthrough discovery in 1991,3 intensive research has been focused on achieving a higher energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs by improving the light harvesting capacities of the dye and the transport of photogenerated electrons through the semiconductor electrode, and by optimizing the dynamics of interfacial recombination.4,5 To achieve this goal, many strategies, such as synthesizing new dye sensitizers,6,7 fabricating photoanodes with enhanced light scattering,8,9 modifying interfaces to suppress the recombination of photoinjected electrons,10,11 and designing suitable structures of photoanodes to improve charge transfer,12,13 have been explored in past two decades.
Among the above routes to improve the performance of DSSCs, it is essential to design and fabricate a compatible structure of the photoanode, due to its important role affecting dye loading, light scattering, and electron diffusion. Various nanoarchitectured TiO2 electrodes have been investigated, such as one-dimensional nanostructures offering an effective electron pathway,14–16 hybrid structures of nanowires/nanotubes mixed with nanoparticles,17,18 and three-dimensional nanostructured photoelectrodes with multiple functions.19,20 However, it is difficult to obtain a suitable electrode with a high surface area, efficient electron transport, and strong light scattering simultaneously. Recently, significant results have been reported: a well interconnected hierarchical TiO2 spheres (TSP) photoelectrode with strong scattering ability has been achieved and applied in DSSCs, reaching a high power conversion efficiency of over 10%.21,22 This hierarchical nanostructure evidently improves the diffusion of electrons among the TiO2 nanocrystals in the spheres, however, its electron diffusion is restricted due to the narrow connections between the TiO2 spheres.21,22 To address this issue, the construction of hierarchical TiO2 spheres is a feasible and effective approach.
More recently, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) from metallic nanostructures has been introduced in DSSCs to enhance light absorption and photocurrent generation. Silver nanoparticles have been loaded onto flat TiO2 film followed by deposition of a thickness-controlled anatase titania layer to enhance the photocurrent of DSSCs, and the distance dependence of the plasmon-enhanced properties has been investigated.23 Core–shell nanoparticles, such as Ag@TiO2,24 Au@SiO2,25 SiO2@Ag,26 and Au@TiO2,27 have been employed to improve the light adsorption and power conversion efficiency of conventional TiO2 photoanode devices. A metallic 2D array has also been introduced to realize the propagation of surface plasmon polaritons, which resulted in the enhancement of DSSC performance.28 Metallic nanostructures can be used as subwavelength antennas in which the plasmonic near-field is coupled to the dye, resulting in the increase of its effective absorption cross-section.29 Though there have been a few demonstrations of plasmon-enhanced performance of DSSCs, to the best of our knowledge, the synergistic effect of SPR and constructed TiO2 nanostructures has never been reported.
Herein, we report constructed hierarchical TiO2 spheres (C-TSP) for DSSCs via the post-treatment of an organic colloid, which remarkably improves electron transport between the TiO2 spheres. In particular, we prepared an Au nanoparticles containing organic colloid (Au@organic colloid) to achieve plasmon-enhanced constructed TiO2 spheres (PC-TSP), resulting in further enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (Scheme 1). The relative performances of the devices based on TSP, C-TSP and PC-TSP, such as photocurrent density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics, incident monochromatic photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE), electron transport properties, and electron lifetime, enable us to identify the underlying enhancement mechanism.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of electron transport in TSP, C-TSP, and PC-TSP. Without treatment, electron diffusion is restricted in TSP due to the narrow connections between TiO2 spheres (dotted arrows), which is improved by organic colloid post-treatment, resulting from the generation of secondary TiO2 nanoparticles between TSPs (solid arrows). When using Au@organic colloid, the optical absorption of dye molecules can be further enhanced by the plasmon resonant Au nanoparticles. 
2. Experimental section
Materials
All reagents and solvents used in this work were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. Tetrabutyl titanate (TBT), hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) (HAuCl4·3H2O), trisodium citrate, and diethanolamine (DEA) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Lithium iodide (LiI, 99%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP, 98%) were obtained from Acros. The Ru dye, cis-di(thiocyanato)-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate) ruthenium(II) (N719), was purchased from Solaronix (Switzerland). Iodine (I2, 99.8%) was obtained from Beijing Yili Chemicals (China). All the reagents used were of analytical purity. Fluorine-doped SnO2 conductive glass (FTO, sheet resistance 10–15 Ω sq−1, Asahi Glass, Japan) was cleaned prior to use by washing with acetone and ethanol, and subsequently drying in air.
Preparation of gold nanoparticles
Gold nanoparticles were synthesized according to previous literature with some modification.25 First, 0.095 g HAuCl4·3H2O was dissolved in 500 mL deionized (DI) water. The solution was heated to boiling point. Then 33 mL aqueous solution containing 0.33 g trisodium citrate was added to the boiling solution, and the resulting mixture turned rose colored. After continuous boiling for 20 min, the solution was allowed to cool naturally. This solution was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 15 min to concentrate. The supernatant was removed, and the gold NPs were redispersed in 40 mL aqueous solution. The obtained solution was stirred and sonicated for more than 30 min, and was used to prepare the Au@organic colloid.
Preparation of organic colloid and Au@organic colloid
First, 2.4 mL DEA was dissolved in 67.8 mL absolute ethanol followed by stirring at 40 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, 8.8 mL TBT was added dropwise to the solution. The mixture was vigorously stirred at 40 °C for 1 h and divided into two equal parts, which were used to prepare the organic colloid (labeled as solution A) and the Au@organic colloid (labeled as solution B). 10 mL ethanol and 0.5 mL DI water were added dropwise into solution A under rapid stirring. After continuous stirring at 40 °C for 1 h, a homogeneous organic colloid was obtained, followed by aging for 24 h. To prepare the Au@organic colloid, 10 mL ethanol, 0.4 mL DI water, and 0.1 mL as-prepared gold nanoparticles solution were added dropwise to solution B, followed by the same preparation process as for the organic colloid.
Preparation of constructed photoanodes
Hierarchical TiO2 spheres (TSP) were synthesized via a two-step process of controlled hydrolysis and hydrothermal reaction according to a published method.21 To prepare the mesoporous TiO2 electrode, 1.0 g synthesized TSP was dispersed into a mixture of 0.2 g ethyl cellulose, 0.05 g lauric acid, and 5.0 mL terpinol to form a slurry, and the resulting slurry was then coated onto the FTO surface using a doctor-blade method, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 15 min. To prepare photoanodes based on the constructed (C-TSP) and plasmon-enhanced constructed (PC-TSP) TiO2 spheres, the films composed of TSP were immersed into the organic and Au@organic colloid for 1 min, respectively. After removal from the colloid, the post-treated films were dried in air. Subsequently, the TiO2 films based on TSP, C-TSP, and PC-TSP were all sintered at 500 °C for 15 min.
Fabrication of DSSCs
The prepared photoanodes were immersed in a 0.5 mM solution of N719 dye in acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol (volume ratio of 1:1) and kept at room temperature for 24 h. Then the TiO2 electrodes were washed with acetonitrile to remove the accumulated dye molecules to ensure that the nanocrystalline TiO2 was covered with a monolayer of dye molecules, followed by drying at 60 °C in air. The Pt-coated FTO, used as the counter electrode, was prepared by a sputtering method. The electrolyte consisted of 0.1 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazoliumiodide (PMII), 0.05 M LiI, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GNCS), 0.03 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpridine (TBP) in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and propylene carbonate (PC) (volume ratio of 1:1). The active area of the dye-coated TiO2 film was 0.25 cm2.
Characterization
TEM and HRTEM observations of the synthesized gold nanoparticles and ultramicrotomed TSP were carried out using a JEOL 2010. The optical absorption spectroscopy measurements were performed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Varian). The morphology of the synthesized TSP and the corresponding film was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL 6700F). The thickness of the TiO2 electrodes was determined by a TalyForm S4C-3D profilometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the films based on TSP, C-TSP, and PC-TSP were taken using a Bruker XRD system (D8 Advanced, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). The diffraction data were obtained at 2θ = 20–80°, with a step size of 0.02°. Photocurrent–voltage characteristics were measured via applying an external potential bias to the device under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (Newport, 91192) with an intensity of 90 mW cm−2, which was calibrated by a Si photodiode, and the active area was controlled by a 0.25 cm2 mask. A 300 W xenon lamp (Newport, USA) was used to give incident light ranging from 400 to 700 nm for the incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were preformed on a CHI660C (Shanghai, China) electrochemical station with the frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at open circuit conditions under illumination. Open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) characteristics of the devices were measured with a CHI660C via recording the subsequent decay of photovoltage after turning off the illumination in a steady state.
3. Results and discussion
Hierarchical TiO2 spheres (TSP) were synthesized via a two-step process of controlled hydrolysis and hydrothermal reaction according to a previously published method with some modification. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of as-synthesized TSP and the corresponding film are shown in Fig. 1a and b. The spheres, with a diameter of ∼250 nm, retain their hierarchical structures after forming the film. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the ultramicrotomed sample shows that TSP is porous and crystalline (Fig. 1c). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 1d indicates that the TiO2 crystals in TSP are tightly interconnected, and the distance between neighboring lattice fringes is about 0.352 nm, corresponding to the (101) planes. It can be inferred from the morphological characteristics of TSP that electron transport within a single TiO2 sphere is efficient. However, electron transfer between neighboring spheres is difficult, due to the narrow contact area among large spheres. To overcome the drawback of this structure, a deformed spherical structure has been formed in a seminal work.21 However, this methodology cannot be combined with other approaches for achieving higher energy conversion efficiency, and it is not suitable for other structures. Accordingly, an organic colloid has been prepared for post-treatment of the photoanode based on TSP to improve the connection between TiO2 spheres by the generation of secondary TiO2 nanoparticles. To investigate the synergistic effect of SPR and constructed TiO2 nanostructures, gold nanoparticles with a size of ∼15 nm (Fig. 1e) were added into the organic colloid. The absorption spectra of the organic and Au@organic colloids show an obvious enhancement in the region of 500–600 nm (Fig. 1f). It can be seen that the colloid turned pink and was still homogenous after adding Au NPs (Fig. 1f, inset). Fig. 2 shows the typical XRD patterns of the films based on TSP, C-TSP, and PC-TSP after annealing at 500 °C for 15 min, indicating that all the anodes possess highly crystalline anatase structures without any impurity phase.

The films consisting of TSP were constructed via post-treatment with organic and Au@organic colloids. The obtained photoanodes were labeled as C-TSP and PC-TSP, respectively, and their performances were compared to those without treatment. Fig. 3a shows the photocurrent density versus voltage characteristics (J–V) of the DSSCs assembled with photoanodes based on TSP, C-TSP, and PC-TSP; the curves were measured under a simulated AM 1.5 G illumination intensity of 90 mW cm−2 and at a temperature of 293 K. Detailed photovoltaic characteristics of the DSSCs made with different photoanodes are listed in Table 1. The short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of the device based on TSP were 10.14 mA cm−2, 717 mV, and 0.701, respectively, corresponding to a power conversion efficiency (η) of 5.64%. After modification with organic colloid, C-TSP shows an obvious enhancement of all photovoltage parameters. Since η = (JscVocFF)/P0, where P0 is the intensity of incident light, the device employing C-TSP gives a higher power conversion efficiency of 6.33%. It is thus apparent that the construction of TSP is feasible and effective. More impressively, a further improvement of Jsc and η was achieved when TSP was constructed with the Au@organic colloid. PC-TSP gives the highest power conversion efficiency of 6.62%, which is an increase of 17.4% compared to TSP and 4.6% compared to C-TSP. For C-TSP and PC-TSP, the significant difference in Jsc and η can be attributed to the addition of Au nanoparticles.

To identify the synergistic effect of SPR and constructed TSP on device performance, the absorbed dye concentration on the TiO2 surface was quantified by desorbing the N719 dye from the TiO2 electrodes in an alkaline aqueous medium. Absorption spectra of the N719 dye in 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution are shown in Fig. 4a. The dye loadings in 9 μm thick films made of TSP, C-TSP, and PC-TSP were calculated as 2.07 × 10−7, 2.42 × 10−7, and 2.40 × 10−7 mol cm−2 (Table 1), respectively. It can be seen that the amount of dye adsorption is increased by post-treatment, implying the generation of secondary TiO2 nanoparticles. However. the dye loading of PC-TSP is almost same as that of C-TSP, indicating that the improvement of Jsc in the case of PC-TSP compared to C-TSP could be attributed to SPR from the Au nanoparticles rather than excess dye loading. Oscillating conduction electrons of Au nanoparticles resonate with the electric field of incident light, resulting in enhancement of the oscillating electric fields that are localized in the vicinity of Au nanoparticles. The localized electric fields can excite dyes more effectively than the incident far-field light.30 To reveal the effect of plasmon resonant Au nanoparticles on dye excitation, the incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiencies (IPCE) as a function of wavelength for the devices composed of TSP, C-TSP, and PC-TSP were measured. The IPCE is determined by the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), the quantum yield of electron injection from the excited sensitizer into the TiO2 conduction band, the efficiency of dye regeneration, and the collection efficiency of photo-generated charge carriers. Therefore, increasing the efficiency of dye excitation will directly improve the LHE and the IPCE, if the other factors are not affected. As shown in Fig. 3b, PC-TSP gives higher IPCE values than C-TSP over the whole visible wavelength range, indicating that the SPR from the Au nanoparticles has a promoting action on dye excitation. In addition, the IPCE enhancement of C-TSP compared to TSP is attributed to the improvement of light adsorption derived from the better dye loading and electron transfer between the TiO2 spheres. In order to investigate the stability of photocurrent generation, the time-dependent photocurrents of the DSSCs with different constructed photoanodes were recorded with repeated on/off cycles of simulated sunlight illumination, shown in Fig. 4b. The devices based on TSP, C-TSP, and PC-TSP display highly stable photocurrents of 2.53 ± 0.005, 2.73 ± 0.005, and 2.90 ± 0.01 mA, respectively. Under illumination, the highest photocurrent is obtained by PC-TSP, which is due to the oscillating electric field produced by the plasmon resonant nanoparticles that couples light effectively from far-field to near-field of the dye molecule. These experiments suggest the merits of construction for TSP, and the synergistic effect of SPR from the Au nanoparticles.

(b) Incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiencies as a function of wavelength for devices composed of TSP, C-TSP, and PC-TSP. 
Electron transport properties were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to further identify the underlying enhancement mechanism. Fig. 5 shows Nyquist plots of the DSSCs based on TSP, C-TSP, and PC-TSP measured under illumination at open circuit conditions. The internal impedances were determined by fitting the experimental data with an equivalent circuit (Fig. 5, inset), which consists of an ohmic series resistance of the device (Rs, starting point of the first semicircle in the Nyquist plot), charge transport resistance at the conducting layer/photoanode and counter electrode/electrolyte (R1, first semicircle in the Nyquist plot), charge transfer resistance at the photoanode/electrolyte (R2, second semicircle in the Nyquist plot), the constant phase element of capacitance corresponding to R1 (CPE1) and R2 (CPE2).31 Fitting results determined from EIS analysis are listed in Table 2. Rs of the devices based on TSP, C-TSP, and PC-TSP are 21.01, 19.67, and 19.20 Ω, respectively. This implies that the ohmic series resistance of the device has been decreased by construction of TSP, which makes the electron transfer easier. The presence of Au nanoparticles further increases the conductivity of the constructed film. R1 of TSP (6.75 Ω) is higher than that of C-TSP (5.98 Ω), and the device constructed with PC-TSP has the lowest resistance (4.93 Ω). The value of R1 is given by the sum of charge transfer resistances at the conducting layer/photoanode and counter electrode/electrolyte.32 Since an identical Pt counter electrode was employed for all the devices, the decrease in R1 is entirely caused by the formation of secondary TiO2 nanoparticles between FTO and TSP, which improves electron transport at this interface. R2 is associated with the resistance of interfacial charge transfer from the photoanode to triiodide in the electrolyte.32 After treatment with the organic colloid, C-TSP shows a higher value of R2 than TSP. This implies that electron recombination is decreased at the photoanode/electrolyte interface due to the improvement of electron transfer between neighboring TiO2 spheres. Thus the device based on C-TSP shows enhanced Jsc and Voc compared to TSP. However, R2 of the device based on PC-TSP is the lowest of all, indicating an increase of recombination current at this interface. It might be inferred that Au nanoparticles not only lead to a significant increase of photogenerated electrons via producing a plasmonic near-field to excite dyes more effectively, but also act as recombination centers. Therefore, Voc of PC-TSP is slightly decreased compared to C-TSP, which is in good agreement with the J–V characteristics. Electron lifetime in a photoanode can be estimated from the frequency of minimum Z′′ (ωmin) at the second semicircle in the Nyquist plot:33

As revealed in Table 2, it is worth noting that the τe of PC-TSP is the longest of all, even though the presence of Au nanoparticles increases charge recombination. This can be attributed to the fact that improved electron transfer is the major factor leading to an increase in the electron lifetime under illumination, especially in the case of PC-TSP, corresponding to a high electron density resulting from the SPR of the Au nanoparticles.
In order to further identify the origin of the increase in electron lifetime, open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) characteristics of the devices with different photoanodes were measured. OCVD is a technique which monitors the subsequent decay of photovoltage (Voc) after turning off the illumination in a steady state. Fig. 6a illustrates the representative voltage decay curves of the three devices. The electron lifetimes (recombination response times, τn) for these devices are calculated from the data shown in Fig. 6a by the following equation:34  where kBT is the thermal energy, and e is the positive elementary charge. The electron lifetime (in log-linear representation) as a function of open-circuit voltage for the DSSCs with different constructional photoanodes is plotted in Fig. 6b. Since the starting point for the Voc decay measurement is the non-equilibrium steady state of a device illuminated at constant intensity, the value of the curve at high voltage (>0.6 V) mainly reflects the electron lifetime in the photoanode under working conditions.34,35 As revealed in the high voltage region of Fig. 6b, τn of C-TSP is longer than that of TSP, and PC-TSP has the longest τn of all the devices. These results are consistent with the EIS analysis, indicating that the improvement of charge transfer is significant for the increase of electron lifetime at high electron density conditions.

The impedance spectra were measured at open-circuit conditions under illumination. Inset shows the equivalent circuit. The symbols are the experimental data, and the solid lines are the fitted results. 
To investigate the advantages of the plasmon-enhanced constructed TSP over the conventional TiCl4 post-treated TSP, we compared their J–V characteristics. As shown in Fig. 7, the DSSC based on PC-TSP achieves a power conversion efficiency (η) of 6.62%, whereas the device based on TSP treated with TiCl4 shows an efficiency of 6.41%. Furthermore, this methodology can be incorporated with plasmon resonant metal nanostructures to achieve higher energy conversion efficiencies. This implies the merits of constructing TSP with a plasmon-enhanced colloid, compared to conventional TiCl4 post-treatment.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the construction of hierarchical TiO2 spheres via an organic colloid is a feasible and effective approach to improving the electron transfer between neighboring TiO2 spheres. Moreover, localized electric fields can be produced by the addition of Au nanoparticles to the colloid, which can excite dye molecules more effectively than the incident far-field light, thus leading to enhanced light adsorption and photocurrent generation in dye-sensitized solar cells. The synergistic effect of surface plasmon resonance and constructed TiO2 nanostructures has been investigated, and was confirmed by optical spectroscopy, J–V characteristics, EIS analysis and OCVD measurements. Therefore, we outline a successful strategy for incorporating plasmon resonant metal nanoparticles into constructed TSP. Most significantly, this methodology can be extended to the construction of other TiO2 structures, and the morphology of the metallic nanoparticles is tunable, to further optimize the performance of DSSCs.

 	Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of electron transport in TSP, C-TSP, and PC-TSP. Without treatment, electron diffusion is restricted in TSP due to the narrow connections between TiO2 spheres (dotted arrows), which is improved by organic colloid post-treatment, resulting from the generation of secondary TiO2 nanoparticles between TSPs (solid arrows). When using Au@organic colloid, the optical absorption of dye molecules can be further enhanced by the plasmon resonant Au nanoparticles.	 

 	Fig. 1  SEM micrographs of (a) synthesized TSP and (b) the corresponding film without treatment. (c) TEM micrograph of the ultramicrotomed TSP. (d) HRTEM image of TiO2 crystals within TSP. (e) TEM micrograph shows ∼15 nm diameter gold nanoparticles. (f) Absorption spectra of the organic colloid and Au@organic colloid; inset of (f) is the corresponding digital image of the organic colloid (left) and the Au@organic colloid (right).

 	Fig. 5  Nyquist plots and corresponding fitted curves of the devices employing photoanodes based on TSP, C-TSP, and PC-TSP. The impedance spectra were measured at open-circuit conditions under illumination. Inset shows the equivalent circuit. The symbols are the experimental data, and the solid lines are the fitted results.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) Open-circuit voltage decay for DSSCs based on TSP, C-TSP, and PC-TSP. (b) Electron lifetime (in log-linear representation) as a function of open-circuit voltage for DSSCs with different constructional photoanodes.
