    , Accepted 29th November 2022First published on 2nd December 2022AbstractThe gradual depletion of global fossil energy and environmental pollution make the development of hydrogen energy an imminent concern. Two-dimensional g-C3N4 (CN) based heterostructures have attracted considerable research interest in the photocatalytic H2 evolution field, but the unsatisfactory interfacial contact between metal-free CN and other metal oxide/sulfide semiconductors usually results in a low transfer efficiency of charge carriers. Herein, we develop a new homojunction by in situ decoration of CN nanosheets with a C–N compound broken by s-triazine units (abbreviated to BST). The resultant CN/BST homojunction presents significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2 generation (12.47 mmol g−1 h−1), which is about 4 and 33 times higher than that of pristine CN (3.086 mmol g−1 h−1) and BST (0.376 mmol g−1 h−1), respectively. It is revealed that the BST fragments tightly anchored on the CN nanosheets act as electron-trapping agents to rapidly transfer photogenerated electrons from the CN conduction band to generate hydrogen, effectively inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. The work shows that the construction of a suitable homojunction is an effective way to obtain high photocatalytic activity.
1. Introduction
Limited fossil energy and increasing environmental pollution are greatly forcing humans to imperatively seek renewable energy.1,2 Inexhaustible solar energy, its capture, storage and utilization have attracted extensive attention.3,4 Photocatalytic technology has enormous potential in utilizing incomparably abundant solar energy to convert water into hydrogen energy.5,6 However, the hydrogen production efficiency of currently developed photocatalysts is low, resulting in a certain distance from industrial application. Therefore, the development of efficient and environmentally friendly photocatalysts has become a critical step in realizing energy transformation and application.7 A variety of semiconductor materials have been studied for photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting, such as metal sulfides, metal oxides, metal–organic frameworks, and organic polymers.8–10 Among them, as a metal-free organic polymer semiconductor, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, shortened to CN) presents an attractive prospect in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production.11–14
Despite pure CN having many advantages as a photocatalyst, it still has inherent limitations in terms of low conductivity, resulting in low energy conversion efficiency, poor charge separation and weak light absorption. An effective solution is to combine pure CN with other semiconductors to form heterostructures.15,16 However, it is difficult to form an effective contact interface in heterojunctions between metal-free CN and other metal oxide/sulfide semiconductors, which leads to high resistance as well as low efficiency of electron transfer and separation.17,18
Homojunctions may be an efficient strategy to solve the problem mentioned above. Homojunctions consisting of metal oxides were successfully developed ten years ago.19 Compared with pristine anatase TiO2, a homojunction consisting of anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2 presents a significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance.20,21 Although it has long been predicted that a layered g-C3N4/g-C3N4 metal-free homojunction is expected to open up a new avenue for the development of promising visible-light photocatalysts,7,22 a homojunction based on CN materials has only recently been reported,23,24 showing promising research and development prospects.
Based on the above background, herein, we develop a new homojunction based on CN materials by decorating CN nanosheets with a broken s-triazine unit C–N compound (abbreviated as BST) fragment (the preparation procedure is shown in Scheme 1). The resultant CN/BST-0.05 presented significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2 generation (12.47 mmol g−1 h−1). The physicochemical properties of the newly developed CN/BST photocatalysts were characterized in detail, and the reasons for the enhanced photocatalytic performance are revealed in depth.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Catalyst preparation

2.1.1 Chemicals. 
Dicyandiamide (99%, Aladdin), sodium citrate (99%, Aladdin), melamine (99%, Aladdin), triethanolamine (99%, Aladdin) and ethanol (99%, Aladdin) were used. All the chemicals are analytical reagents without further purification.


2.1.2 Preparation of CN nanosheets and BST. 
The CN nanosheets were obtained by peeling them from bulk CN (BCN). The BCN was firstly synthesized through a thermal polycondensation method. In detail, a certain amount of dicyandiamide was heated to 550 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and maintained at 550 °C for 4 h in air, resulting in BCN. After that, 0.5 g of BCN was calcinated at 520 °C for 4 h in air to obtain CN.
1.01 g of melamine and 0.81 g of sodium citrate were milled and mixed evenly into a fine powder with an agate mortar.22 Then, the mixed powder was heated at 180 °C in an unsealed crucible for 2 h at a ramp rate of 3 °C min−1 in a muffle furnace. Subsequently, the obtained white solid was milled into powder, and was then dialyzed until there was no impurity (Fig. S1†). Finally, the residue after dialysis (MD44-1000) was freeze-dried to give BST.


2.1.3 Preparation of CN/BST-X (X = 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3). 
200 mg of CN and different amounts (0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 g) of melamine and sodium citrate were milled and mixed well into a fine powder using an agate mortar. The mass ratio of melamine and sodium citrate was the same as BST. The mixed powder was heated at 180 °C in an uncapped crucible for 2 h at a ramp rate of 3 °C min−1 in a muffle furnace. Finally, the obtained white powder was dialyzed and then freeze-dried to obtain the final samples, named CN/BST-X (X = 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3).


2.1.4 The fabrication of control samples. 
As an important control sample, CN-180 was fabricated at the same time. In detail, 200 mg of CN nanosheets were heated at 180 °C in an uncapped crucible for 2 h at a ramp rate of 3 °C min−1 in a muffle furnace without other processing. CN–Na-0.05 was also fabricated by heating 200 mg of CN nanosheets and sodium citrate at 180 °C in an uncapped crucible for 2 h at a ramp rate of 3 °C min−1 in a muffle furnace without any post-processing.

2.2 Photocatalytic H2 evolution
The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting was carried out in a top-irradiation quartz cell connected to a closed glass gas circulation system (CEL-SPH2N, Beijing). In a typical photocatalytic reaction, 5 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in 20 mL of aqueous solution containing 10% triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial agent. An H2PtCl6 solution (3.0 wt%) was added into the system as co-catalyst. The suspension was thoroughly evacuated and then irradiated using a 225 W Xe lamp. The temperature of the reaction solution was kept at 6 °C by a flow of cooling water during the photocatalytic reaction. The evolved H2 was analyzed with an online thermal conductivity detector (TCD) gas chromatograph (GC-9720, nitrogen carrier).
2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements
An electrochemical workstation CHI660E was used to conduct photoelectrochemical measurements. A three-electrode configuration cell was used with the assembled photoelectrodes as the working electrode, Pt mesh as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (in 3 M KCl) as the reference electrode. The working electrode was prepared as follows: 5 mg of the as-fabricated sample was suspended in deionized water (0.5 mL) with a 5 wt% dispersion of Nafion D-520 (0.05 mL), and then the mixture was dispersed by ultrasonication and spread onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass. After drying naturally, the FTO glass was heated at 120 °C for 1 h to evaporate the solvent. For photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, the prepared thin film acted as the working electrode, with a platinum plate as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (in 3 m KCl) as the reference electrode. A 0.1 M aqueous solution of Na2SO4 was used as the electrolyte. A 300 W Xe lamp was used as a light source for photocurrent measurements. The Efb values of the samples were obtained from Mott–Schottky plots recorded at frequencies of 1 kHz, 500 Hz and 100 Hz.
2.4 Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D2 Phaser instrument using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) in step mode between 10° and 50°. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) mapping images were recorded on a Talos L120C G2 and a Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscope (Talos F200X), respectively. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer (JASCO, V-670) with an integrating sphere (with BaSO4 as reference material). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured with a fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS 980), and the time-resolved PL spectra were measured using a 405 nm impulse lamp (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS 1000). The surface morphology and nano-tribological properties were measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM) (Bruker Dimension Icon). FT-IR spectra were measured with a Bruker VERTEX 70 Micro-Infrared Spectrometer. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis served to obtain the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm at −196 °C (Autosorb-iQ, Quantachrome, USA). The BET data were analyzed by the density functional theory (DFT) method to get the specific surface area (SSA), pore size and pore volume. The SSA values of all samples were calculated from the BET analysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured using a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB Xi+ instrument. All binding energies were calibrated with adventitious C 1s (284.6 eV) to make up for surface charge effects. Surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy was measured on a CEL-SPS100 based on a locking amplifier and a monochromatic light source.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Physicochemical properties of catalysts

Fig. 1 displays the TEM images of the samples. Pure carbon nitride (CN) presents ultrathin two-dimensional nanosheets (Fig. 1a). The BST presents fragments with a size of 20–50 nm (Fig. 1b, c and S2†). Both fragments and nanosheets can be observed from the TEM images of CN/BST-0.05 (Fig. 1d–f) and the dark parts marked with red circles in Fig. 1f can be ascribed to the BST fragments anchored on CN nanosheets. The TEM and EDS mapping images of pure CN display ultrathin nanosheets and a uniform element distribution (Fig. S3†). The corresponding EDS mapping images (Fig. 1h and i) display a uniform distribution of C and N elements in CN/BST-0.05.

The morphology of CN/BST-0.05, CN and BST was further investigated by AFM to illustrate the formation of a homojunction. Fig. 2a and b are respectively the two- and three-dimensional AFM images of CN/BST-0.05, where the observed sharp image contrast change and the significant increased plane height show that the BST has combined directly with CN. It can be observed from the AFM image of the CN film (Fig. 2c and S4†) that the planar nanosheets have a thickness of 3 nm. It has been reported that the theoretical thickness of monolayer CN is about 0.325 nm,25,26 so the CN nanosheets we obtained were stacks of about 10 monolayers. In addition, it can be concluded from Fig. 2d and S4† that, at the location where BST is present, the thickness data of CN/BST-0.05 shows a significant increase of around 20 nm in height, where the measured size of BST fragments (blue circles in Fig. 2d) was 20–50 nm, in good agreement with the results of TEM (Fig. 1). Therefore, it can be clarified from the TEM and AFM measurements that the BST fragments with a size of 20–50 nm are in close contact on the surface of the CN nanosheets and formed the homojunction structure.

The XRD patterns shown in Fig. 3a were utilized to analyze the crystal structure of the samples. The two characteristic peaks located at 13.0° and 27.4° are the typical (100) and (002) planes of CN, respectively,27 which separately belong to the in-plane structural packing motif and interplanar stacking of aromatic systems.28 Apparently, the two observed peaks both shift to a higher 2 theta degree after combining with BST. Considering that an increased 2 theta degree implies a decreased crystal planar spacing, the higher-degree-shifted XRD signal indicates that the BST was in strong contact with CN and resulted in a decreased interplanar spacing in the formed homojunction. The strong contact force between CN nanosheets and BST mainly comes from the similar atom arrangement and crystal structure of the two materials.

The specific surface area and pore structure of the samples were studied by using N2 adsorption–desorption tests. As shown in Fig. 3b, the adsorption–desorption isotherms of the samples belong to type IV except for BST with a type I isotherm,29,30 indicating the mesoporous structure of CN and CN/BST homojunctions. The pore size distributions (the inset in Fig. 3b) of CN nanosheets, CN/BST-0.05 and BST are calculated to be around 27.034 nm, 10.321 nm and 7.441 nm, respectively (Table S1†). Consequently, the pore volume, surface area and pore size of CN/BST samples are gradually decreased after the formation of a homojunction, which can be ascribed to the layer stacking and stronger interaction. The experimental results of BET are in good agreement with those of XRD, indicating the combination of CN and BST.
The tiny functional group difference between CN and BST can be observed from the results of the FT-IR spectra. As illustrated in Fig. 3c, the peaks at 1200–1600 cm−1 can be ascribed to skeletal vibrations of aromatic C–N heterocycles,31 and the peaks appearing at 3000–3500 cm−1 are related to the surface amino (N–H) and hydroxyl (O–H) groups.32,33 It was noticed that BST shows stronger absorption at 3000–3500 cm−1, because the broken triazine ring structure results in more defects and more hydroxyl (O–H) groups. Besides, a strong characteristic peak at around 810 cm−1 is ascribed to the breathing vibration of s-triazine units,34 which can only be observed in the FT-IR spectrum of CN and CN/BST, and the absence of the vibration peak at 810 cm−1 in BST indicates that the s-triazine units have been successfully broken with treatment by sodium citrate. The FT-IR spectrum of CN/BST-0.05 is closer to that of pure CN except for the absorption enhancement at around the 520 cm−1, 1200 cm−1, and 3000–3500 cm−1 positions due to the decoration with BST.
Combined with Raman analysis (Fig. S5†), the structural characteristics of the material can be better explained. Raman spectrum of the g-C3N4 using green laser excitation (514 nm) was not successful because of the strong fluorescent background, so the three samples were detected by 325 nm laser excitation. For BST fragments, the peaks at 677 and 978 cm−1 are associated with different types of ring breathing modes of melamine.35,36 The peaks at 702, 768, 1401 and 1488 cm−1 derived from the vibration (breathing mode of triazine ring, bending mode of graphitic domains) of CN disappear in BST.37,38 The peak at 1118 cm−1 belonging to the characteristic peak of CN also disappears in BST.39 The peaks at 1578 and 1620 cm−1 assigned to the stretching of the triazine ring have declined to some degree.35,36 The changes in all these peaks indicate the formation of a broken s-triazine structure and a homojunction.
The optical behavior of CN, BST and CN/BST-0.05 is shown in Fig. 3d. The absorption edge of the CN sample is located at around 440 nm, and CN/BST-0.05 shows stronger absorption than CN, especially in 230–440 nm. It is reported that the absorption spectrum of this tri-s-triazine monomer has four absorption peaks respectively located at 145, 180, 214 and 266 nm in the ultraviolet range.35,40 The electronic structure of the tri-s-triazine monomer, including the energy gap between the highest occupied orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied orbit (LUMO) as well as the excited state properties, has been investigated.35,40 The peak at 214 nm mainly originates from electron excitation from H − 6 (HOMO − 6) → L + 1 (LUMO + 1) and H − 5 → L. The peak at 266 nm comes from multiple electron transitions, such as H − 5 → L, H → L + 2 and H → L + 1.35,40 Among them, the absorption centered at 214 nm is the strongest, in good agreement with our experimental results. The band gaps obtained from the corresponding Tauc plots are illustrated in Fig. S6,† which for CN, BST and CN/BST-0.05 are 3.09, 2.95 and 4.67 eV, respectively.

Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectra of the samples. In the C 1s XPS spectrum of CN (Fig. 4a), the peak at the binding energy of ∼284.6 eV belongs to a carbon atom (C–C). The peak at ∼288.1 eV belongs to sp2-bonded carbon (N–CN) and the peak at 287.8 eV belongs to CO.34,41 Compared with CN, BST has a weak peak at 286.5 eV, belonging to an sp3-coordinated carbon bond, which can be ascribed to the surface defects produced by the broken s-triazine unit. CN/BST-0.05 presents a weaker peak at 286.5 eV with a smaller CO peak area. The N 1s XPS spectrum of CN (Fig. 4b) exhibits three peaks at around 398.3, 399.4 and 400.9 eV, which can be assigned to sp2-bonded N (C–NC), triazine ring (N–(C)3) and amino groups (C–N–H), respectively.42 Compared with CN, the N content in BST decreases due to the broken s-triazine unit. The peak assigned to the triazine ring (N–(C)3) of CN/BST-0.05 shifts slightly to 399.6 eV, suggesting that the strong bonding resulted from a homojunction. In the O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 4c), the signal peaking at 532.3 eV belongs to chemisorbed oxygen (OC). A new peak appears at 531.2 eV in the O 1s XPS spectrum of BST, which can be assigned to an oxygen vacancy (OV).43 The OV makes a positive contribution in providing absorption sites for oxygen and H+.44 The XPS results reveal the presence of a broken s-triazine unit in BST as well as the formation of a homojunction by combining CN and BST.

3.2 Photocatalytic H2 evolution and photoelectrochemical properties of catalysts

Fig. 5a presents the photocatalytic H2 evolution (PHE) performance of the samples. Both CN and BST show poor PHE performance with hydrogen production rates of 3.086 and 0.376 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively. After the formation of a homojunction, CN/BST samples present obviously enhanced PHE performance. Among them, CN/BST-0.05 has the highest PHE performance with a hydrogen production rate of 12.47 mmol g−1 h−1, which is 4 times that of CN and 33 times that of pure BST. In order to better reveal the important role of the formed homogeneous junctions in improving hydrogen production ability, some reference samples were tested under the same conditions. The sample for CN simply mixed with BST shows 3.408 mmol g−1 h−1, while the photocatalytic performances of CN–Na-0.05 and CN-180 are separately 3.153 and 3.159 mmol g−1 h−1, which are far lower than that of CN/BST homojunctions (Fig. S7†). It can thus be concluded that the superior H2 evolution ability in the homojunctions mainly comes from the efficient combination between CN and BST. Additionally, CN/BST-0.05 also shows good stability during recycling (Fig. S8†). There is no obvious change in XRD patterns of the sample before and after the photocatalytic test (Fig. S9†). Therefore, the hydrogen production experiment confirms that the formation of a homojunction between CN and BST is efficient in improving the PHE activity and stability of pure CN nanosheets. In addition, we further investigated the PHE performance of CN/BST-0.05 under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm), which still exhibits a comparable PHE performance (5.6 mmol g−1 h−1) to those CN-based photocatalysts reported in the literature (Table S2†).
 Fig. 5  (a) Photocatalytic hydrogen production over CN, BST and CN/BST samples; (b) PL spectra of CN, BST and CN/BST-0.05; (c) time-resolved transient PL decay of CN, BST and CN/BST-0.05; (d) transient photocurrent response; (e) surface photovoltage spectra and (f) electrochemical impedance spectra of CN, BST and CN/BST-0.05. 
The PL spectra of the samples are displayed in Fig. 5b, where it can be observed that pure BST displayed a relatively low PL intensity, while the PL intensity of CN/BST-0.05 is significantly stronger than that of pure CN and BST, indicating a higher concentration of photogenerated carriers after the introduction of BST.45,46 The increased PL spectrum intensity reveals that BST can efficiently capture electrons generated by photo-excited CN, inhibiting the recombination of electron–hole pairs in pure CN nanosheets. Fig. 5c shows the PL decay curves of CN, BST and CN/BST-0.05, and the fitted data of average lifetimes (Table S3†) are 5.9377, 4.5835 and 5.7886 ns, respectively. Compared with CN, the PL lifetime decreases from 5.9377 ns of CN to 5.7886 ns of CN/BST-0.05, which means that the formation of a homojunction promotes the transfer of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.10,15
Significant performance gains are of great interest and deserve to be studied in depth by related electrochemical tests. The transient photocurrent responses of CN, BST and CN/BST-0.05 depicted that the best sample CN/BST-0.05 has a stronger photocurrent response than the others (Fig. 5d), indicating that the photogenerated electrons accumulate extremely quickly on the surface of the material when the light is on, which is beneficial to the reduction of hydrogen ions in solution.8 Continuous experiments like the surface photovoltage spectra in Fig. 5e were used to describe the concentration of photogenerated holes on the surface of the materials.47 Originally, the photogenerated holes of CN were mainly located at 300–400 nm while those of BST fragments were located at 400–500 nm. As for CN/BST-0.05, the photogenerated holes were mainly located at 300–400 nm, indicating that the photogenerated holes were mainly accumulated on CN. At the same time, it was noticed that the SPV intensity of CN/BST is ten times that of CN. The sharply increased SPV intensity meant that the introduction of BST accelerated the transfer of photogenerated electrons and thus efficiently inhibited the recombination of electrons and holes, which left photogenerated holes on CN.48 Additionally, the results of impedance spectroscopy spectra (EIS) tests are shown in Fig. 5f, where it can be seen that CN/BST displayed the smallest Nyquist radius in the measured samples. It has been reported that the smaller the radius of an EIS plot, the higher the separation efficiency of a photogenerated e−–h+ pair.47 Thus, the EIS test further verified a lower charge carrier transfer resistance in CN/BST-0.05 due to the formation of a homojunction.
3.3 Photocatalytic mechanism
In order to judge the transfer direction of photogenerated electrons and holes, the band structures of CN and BST are obtained from the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots. It is apparent that the positive slope of the M–S plots confirmed that both g-C3N4, BST and CN/BST-0.05 belong to an n-type conductor. As shown in Fig. S10,† the flat band potential (Efb) values of CN, BST and CN/BST-0.05 are about −0.90, −0.58 and −1.10 eV, respectively. The bandgaps of CN, BST and CN/BST-0.05 are shown in Fig. S6.† The valence band (VB) positions for CN, BST and CN/BST-0.05 are calculated to be 2.19, 4.09 and 1.85 eV vs. NHE from the equation EVB = ECB + Eg.49–51 Therefore, we proposed the reaction mechanism of CN/BST-0.05 in photocatalytic H2 generation (Scheme 2). The enhanced photocatalytic H2 generation performance benefits from the effective interfacial homojunction, which accelerates the charge transfer from the photo-excited CN nanosheet to BST. When CN/BST is irradiated by sunlight, CN is excited to generate charge carriers, the electrons are excited to the conduction band (CB) and holes are maintained on the valence band (VB).52 BST cannot be excited under our Xe lamp (λ ≥ 320 nm) because of a wide bandgap of 4.67 eV. Due to the special tiny size effect and suitable energy band structure, BST worked as an electron acceptor to harvest electrons from CN. Then electrons rapidly transfer and accumulate on the surface of BST due to the broken s-triazine units contributing many sites to absorb oxygen and further grab H+, which provides sufficient sites to reduce H+ into hydrogen and greatly sensitizes the hydrogen evolution process of CN. On the other hand, holes are preserved on the spacious CN nanosheet to oxidize the sacrificial electron donor TEOA.53 The effective separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes in CN enormously improves PHE. It can thus be concluded that the formation of a homojunction between CN and BST not only provides a smoother channel for the transfer of charge carriers on the contact interface, but also constructs a new type of self-sensitizing system between CN nanosheets and the broken BST, efficiently promoting the hydrogen evolution ability of CN.

4. Conclusion
In summary, focusing on improving the hydrogen evolution ability of two-dimensional g-C3N4 nanosheets, this work puts forward a homojunction strategy through combining g-C3N4 nanosheets with the C–N compound BST in which the s-triazine unit was broken by sodium citrate. The obtained optimized sample CN/BST-0.05 displayed a high H2 evolution performance of 12.47 mmol g−1 h−1 with good behavior after 4 cycles. Based on relative optical and electrochemical tests, it was found that the enhanced photocatalytic activity comes mainly from the increasing concentration and rapid separation of charge carriers, which is to say that, due to the similar atom arrangement and crystal structure, BST is in intimate contact with the surface of the CN nanosheets and forms a homojunction between the two materials, which strongly minimizes the interfacial charge transfer resistance and provides a smooth channel for charge separation. In addition, the introduced C–N compound BST worked as an electron acceptor to harvest photogenerated electrons from the contacted CN nanosheets, thus efficiently sensitizing the evolution of hydrogen. The construction of a homojunction-based self-sensitized system between g-C3N4 nanosheets and the C–N compound may provide a paradigm for developing a high-performance photocatalyst.
