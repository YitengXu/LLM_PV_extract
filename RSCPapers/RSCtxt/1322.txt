The two complexes, C60–Ru and MWCNT–Ru, were synthesized by ligand substitution in the presence of NH4PF6, and Ru(II)(bpy)2Cl2 was used as a reaction precursor. Both complexes were characterized by mass spectroscopy (MS), elemental analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy (IR), ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy (UV-VIS) spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The results showed that the substitution way of C60–py is different from that of MWCNT–py. The C60–py and a NH3 replaced a Cl− and a bipyridine in Ru(II)(bpy)2Cl2 to produce a five-coordinate complex of [Ru(bpy)(NH3)(C60–py)Cl]PF6, whereas MWCNT–py replaced a Cl− to generate a six-coordinate complex of [Ru(bpy)2(MWCNT–py)Cl]PF6. The cyclic voltammetry study showed that the electron-withdrawing ability was different for C60 and MWCNT. The C60 showed a relatively stronger electron-withdrawing effect with respect to MWCNT.
Introduction
The carbon cluster-based family, including fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, has become a worldwide topic of interest in research due to their unique structure. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are seamless, hollow “microtubules” formed by the single- or multi-layer graphite coiling around the central axis at a certain spiral degree.1 They show unique properties such as confinement effects, high surface energy and surface area, and their highly delocalized π electron system makes them excellent electron–hole conductors. The carbon cluster-based family exhibits a high chemical activity and has potential applications in chemistry, life sciences,2 and photophysics.3,4 In the field of nanobiology, CNTs can be used as biological sensors, cell scaffolds, or as a drug delivery carriers5 because of their good biocompatibility.6 CNTs can be used as good carriers for catalysts due to their properties, which include adsorption–desorption of reactants and products, special stereoselectivity of the cavity space, and strong interactions with metal catalysts. Fullerenes and CNTs have broad potential practical applications in optoelectronics because of their unique electronic structure and strong electron-withdrawing properties.7,8 For example, the fullerene derivative [60]PCBM is a representative n-type semiconductor that can be used to fabricate the photosensitive layer in an organic thin-film solar cell by blending with P3HT.9 CNTs are also intriguing new materials that have been highly touted for their exceptional optical and electrical properties. Overall, the carbon cluster-based family has stimulated great interest in basic science and in high technology areas.
However, CNTs have a low solubility in water and common organic solvents due to their high molecular weight and their aggregation.10 This property, coupled with the difficulty in having stable and uniform molecular combinations, greatly limits applications of the carbon-based family. Thus, the fundamental goal is to enhance the practical application of CNTs in the materials area1 through surface modification and functionalization.
Currently, there are two main methods for the organic chemical modification of CNTs, including organic covalent modification and organic non-covalent chemical modification.11,12 Covalent chemical modification of CNTs is an important tool for introducing new functional groups with specific properties. It can be achieved by (i) oxidation of defect sites at the tube ends and sidewalls and subsequent conversion into derivatives such as amides; and (ii) by addition reactions, such as fluoride addition, free radical addition, Bingel addition, cycloaddition, and aryl diazonium salt addition. The modified carbon cluster is then combined with active groups or forms complexes with metal ions to fabricate high-performance nanofunctional materials13–15 that possess unique biological, catalytic, and optoelectronic properties.
The method of combining the modified carbon cluster with metal ions has a high potential in the preparation of nanostructured composite materials that can meet the requirements of many modern high-technology features.4,16,17 The combination of metal ions and ligands, especially the combination of transition metals with ligands of bi- or terpyridine, and the modified carbon cluster has become a useful tool in fabricating the supramolecular systems. In recent years, Ru(II)polypyridyl complexes have played a key role in photochemistry,18 photophysics,19 photocatalysis,20NLO material,21 electrochemistry, electron and energy transfer, and molecular recognition. One application is the use of ruthenium polypyridyl complexes as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells, which has highly increased the efficiency of photoelectric conversion. The study of the synthesis and properties of such complexes provides a better understanding of the relationship between molecules and materials, thus, playing an important role in the development of new nanophotovoltaic devices. Furthermore, the catalysis of multi-electron processes is one of the major challenges in current photochemistry. Studies of systems wherein the carbon cluster-based family combine with Ru(II) units by acting as acceptors of several electrons are extremely important in meeting these challenges.
This paper presents the synthesis of two carbon-based pyrrolidine pyridine derivatives, C60–py and MWCNT–py, via 1,3-dipolar addition. Two complexes, C60–Ru and MWCNT–Ru, were synthesized by ligand substitution using C60–py and MWCNT–py as the substituted ligands. Characterization of the resulting products and the influences of the different carbon substrates on the resulting products are discussed. The goals of this study are to prepare carbon-based nanofunctional compounds and to provide a foundation in applied research for the production of such complexes.
Results and discussion
There are two methodologies for the formation of carbon cluster-based complexes: (i) synthesis of the ruthenium complex followed by covalent binding to the carbon cluster; (ii) construction of a ligand bearing the [60]fullerene or CNTs followed by assembly of the carbon cluster-based complexes. In the first methodology, an appropriate solvent must be selected to ensure that both the ruthenium complex and [60]fullerene would dissolve completely, thus, decreasing the risk of obtaining polyadducts. C60 is more soluble in less polar solvents such as toluene, whereas the ruthenium complex is usually soluble in more polar solvents only. Thus, it is difficult to determine the suitable solvent. This paper discusses the application of the second methodology for synthesis of the carbon cluster-based complex. As shown in Fig. 1, the synthesis procedure of the carbon cluster-based complex consist of following two steps: (i) synthesis of C60–py and MWCNT–py ligands using the method of 1,3-dipolar addition. To obtain a pure single adduct of C60–py, the added amount of pyridine-4-carbaldehyde must be strictly controlled. The crude product was further purified by column chromatography using alumina as the stationary phase, and toluene–acetonitrile (7:1, v/v) as the mobile phase; (ii) synthesis of the complexes of C60–Ru and MWCNT–Ruvia ligand substitution by refluxing the mixture of Ru(bpy)2Cl2 and C60–py (or MWCNT–py). In this latter step, the carbon cluster-based ligands replaced the ligand Cl− or bpy in Ru(bpy)2Cl2. The addition of an excess of the PF6−-containing salt to exchange the counterions from Cl− to PF6− makes the resulting complex less polar, and improves the solubility of the product in the organic solvents. This facilitates washing the product with a polar solvent to remove the unreacted reactants. The product was washed repeatedly with toluene to ensure the complete removal of unreacted C60–py. At the same time, the product was also washed several times with water and ethanol to get rid of the excess NH4PF6 and Ru(bpy)2Cl2, which are soluble in polar solvents. Ru(bpy)2Cl2, C60–py, and the product were subjected to thin layer chromatography by using a mixture of toluene–acetonitrile (3:1, v/v) as the developing agent. Each of the three specimens showed a single spot with Rf (Rf = distance of component/distance of solvent) at 0, 0.26 and 0.86 respectively. These results indicate that the product was a new species generated by the reaction of Ru(bpy)2Cl2 and C60–py rather than a solvation or a mixture of the reactants.

In recent years, fast atom bombardment (FAB), electrospray ionization (ESI), and matrix-assisted laser desorption–ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry have been important soft ionization techniques in the research on complexes. High sensitivity, specificity, and speed of these techniques offer many advantages over other techniques. In the ESI-MS spectrum of C60–py, a maximum relative intensity peak at m/z 854.2 was detected as the molecular ion peak of C60–py, and a peak at m/z 720 corresponded to the C60 ion fragmentation. In the MALDI-MS spectrum of C60–Ru (Fig. 2), a peak at m/z 1163 was assigned to the fragment ion of [Ru(bpy)(C60–py)(NH3)Cl]+. The molecular ion peak for [Ru(bpy)(C60–py)(NH3)Cl]PF6 was detected at m/z 1308, and a peak at m/z 854 corresponded to the N–methylfullopyrrolidine fragment.
 Fig. 2  
Mass spectra of complex C60–Ru. 
In the 1H NMR spectrum (400 MHz, CDCl3) of C60–Ru, a multiplet signal at δ 7.5–8.5 ppm region was observed due to the mutual coupling among pyridyl-protons of the bpy ring. A singlet signal at 2.846 ppm was detected due to the methyne protons which connected to the pyridine ring. Two pyrrolidine methylene protons were different22 and were assigned to two doublets with J = 9.20 Hz at 4.982 and 4.310 ppm, respectively. A singlet at δ 1.61 ppm was due to the protons of –CH3group which connected to the nitrogen of pyrrolidine, whereas a singlet at 1.277 ppm corresponded to the protons of ammonia.
The characteristic peaks of C60 and Ru(bpy)2Cl2 were observed in the IR spectrum of Ru–C60 (Fig. 3, left). However, the IR spectrum of Ru–C60 was not simply a superimposition of the spectra of C60 and Ru(bpy)2Cl2. Interesting changes were noted from C60, C60–py and Ru(bpy)2Cl2 to C60–Ru. Compared to the IR spectrum of C60, new strong absorptions at 2922, 2852, and 2781 cm−1 were observed, and the relative intensity of the absorption at 574 cm−1 decreased in the IR spectrum of C60–py. Absorptions at 2922, 2852, 2781, and 1735 cm−1 of C60–py disappeared and the relative intensity of the absorption at 574 cm−1 significantly increased. Moreover, absorptions at 1376 and 1030 cm−1 of C60–py shifted to higher wavenumbers in the IR spectrum of C60–Ru. New absorption bands at 3108 and 482 cm−1 were observed and can be ascribed to the N–H vibration. An absorption at 843 cm−1 was attributed to the P–F vibration. It is evident that the IR spectrum of C60–Ru is different from the spectra of C60 and Ru(bpy)2Cl2 as a result of changes in the infrared activity of the bond vibrations due to the change in the molecular dipole moments.
 Fig. 3  
IR spectra of C60–Ru (left) and MWCNT–Ru (right). 
Similar changes were observed in the IR spectra of MWCNT–py and MWCNT–Ru. The IR spectrum of MWCNT–py (Fig. 3, right) shows characteristic absorptions of pyridine groups at 2916 and 2846 cm−1. The bands at 1638, 1561, and 1443 cm−1 are ascribed to the CC stretching modes of the pyridine ring and the CNT ring, indicating the existence of the pyridine group in the compound of MWCNT–py. The characteristic absorption peaks of pyridine groups were also observed at 1384, 1311, 1268, 1157 and 762, 728 cm−1 in the IR spectrum of MWCNT–Ru. However, the IR spectrum of MWCNT–Ru was obviously different from that of MWCNT–py and Ru(bpy)2Cl2. In the IR spectrum of MWCNT–Ru, the peak intensity of the characteristic absorptions of the pyridine group at 2916 and 2846 cm−1 significantly decreased with respect to that of MWCNT–py, which may be ascribed to the change of the molecular dipole moments from MWCNT–Py to MWCNT–Ru. A new absorption band observed at 557 cm−1 was assigned to the stretching vibration mode of N–H, and an absorption appearing at 839 cm−1 was attributed to the vibration of P–F.
The electronic spectra of C60–py, Ru(bpy)2Cl2 and C60–Ru are shown in Fig. 4 (left). C60–py showed weak absorption in the visible region, and peaks at 317 and 257 nm were ascribed to the π–π* transitions of C60.23,24 The complex of Ru(bpy)2Cl2 exhibited the characteristic absorption bands of the Ru(II)polypyridyl complex. The absorptions below 350 nm are attributed to the π–π* transition of the ligands25 where the absorption around 300 nm is attributed to the π–π* transition of bipyridine. Two strong absorption bands at 558.2 and 378.4 nm in the ultraviolet and visible region (350–650 nm) are ascribed to the charge transfer transition of metal–ligand, namely the MLCT transition. Characteristic absorptions of Ru(bpy)2Cl2 and C60–py appeared in the UV-Vis spectrum of C60–Ru. A small but sharp peak at 430 nm was characteristic for fulleropyrrolidines.24 However, the absorption at 558.2 nm of Ru(bpy)2Cl2 shifted to the shorter wavelength region (λ 507.1 nm), which is ascribed to a decrease of the electron density around the ruthenium center and an increase of the MLCT transition energy after the ligand replacement.
 Fig. 4  
Absorption spectra of C60–Ru (left) and MWCNT–Ru (right). 
The UV-Vis spectrum of MWCNT–py (Fig. 4, right) showed no absorption peaks in the visible region but a wide absorption peak at 256 nm was observed, which is consistent with the literature.26,27 Optical transitions between the van Hove singularities were hardly discernible in both UV-Vis spectra of MWCNT–py and MWCNT–Ru.28,29 The characteristic absorption bands of the Ru(II)polypyridyl complex were observed in the UV-Vis spectrum of MWCNT–Ru. However, the UV-Vis spectrum of MWCNT–Ru was different from that of Ru(bpy)2Cl2 and MWCNT–py. Both absorptions of Ru(bpy)2Cl2 at 558 nm and at 378.4 nm shifted to shorter wavelengths at 512 nm and 372 nm in the UV-Vis spectrum of MWCNT–Ru, indicating that MWCNTs show an electron-withdrawing property similar to that of C60. The absorption band of Ru(bpy)2Cl2 (the π–π* transition of bipyridine) at 297 nm remained unchanged in the UV-Vis spectrum of MWCNT–Ru. It is obvious that the reaction of the ligand replacement has a significant effect on the MLCT transition, but has little or no effect on the π–π* transition of bipyridine.
The Raman spectra of p-MWCNTs, MWCNT–py, and MWCNT–Ru are shown in Fig. 5. The Raman peak intensity of the carbon cluster-based compound depends on the optical transition probability and photoelectron coupling. Two Raman absorption bands in the range of 1300–1400 cm−1 (D band) and 1500–1600 cm−1 (G band) were observed in the Raman spectra of the three above-mentioned carbon-based complexes. Compared to p-MWCNTs, the D band of MWCNT–py remained unchanged, but the G band at 1582 cm−1 had split into two peaks, 1580 and 1607 cm−1, which are attributed to the destruction of the symmetry in carbon nanotubes. This resulted in a red shift in the vibration frequency of the G+ (ωE2G+) mode at around 1582 cm−1,22 and a blue shift in other vibration frequency ranges. The D band in the Raman spectrum is known to stem from the defects in the sp2-C structure and its intensity is a measure of the degree of functionalization. Accordingly, the intensity ratio of the D band to G band (ID/IG) reflects the relative amount of sp3-carbon and is used to determine the degree of functionalization. A higher ID/IG value indicates a higher degree of disorder and defects in the CNTs. The increase of the ID/IG value from 0.946 for p-MWCNTs to 1.30 for MWCNT–py indicates that the addition reaction has caused a significant change in the structure and symmetry of CNTs, and confirms the pyridine functionalization of the MWCNTs. The ID/IG value of MWCNT–Ru was essentially the same as that of MWCNT–py, which showed that MWCNT–py complexed with the metal ion via the pyridine nitrogen atom and did not cause damage to the skeleton of MWCNTs. The G band shifted slightly to lower wave numbers, which may be attributed to a decrease of electron density around the carbon atoms of the MWCNTs due to the electron transfer from MWCNT to the Ru(II)bpy moieties.

XPS is an efficient tool for studying the surface chemical composition and the relative content of the functional groups of the modified MWCNTs. Fig. 6 presents the wide-scan XPS spectra of MWCNT–py and MWCNT–Ru. XPS characteristic peaks of the ruthenium(II) 3p1/2 and 3p3/2 appear at the binding energy of 484 and 463 eV, respectively. Fig. 6 shows the characteristic peaks at 400 for N1s, 284.5 for C1s, 197.6 for Cl2p3/2, 686.3 for F1s and 136.3 eV for P2p3/2, indicating the existence of the elements C, N, Ru, Cl, F and P in the MWCNT–Ru. Fluorine and phosphorus were introduced by adding NH4PF6 in the process of the MWCNT–Ru synthesis. To obtain detailed information of each element in the MWCNT–Ru, an analysis of the XPS narrow scan was also performed. MWCNT–Ru was fitted to three Gaussian–Lorentzian curves centered at 284.4, 285.1, and 286.3 eV, which are ascribed to the sp2-hybridized carbons of the CNTs, the sp3-hybridized diamond-like carbons of the CNTs, and the sp2-hybridized carbons of pyridine and bipyridine, respectively. Peak decomposition and subsequent area integration for the narrow-scan XPS peaks of the above-mentioned elements were performed using the software XPSPEAK. By taking into account the relative sensitivity factors for each element, the relative atomic content in MWCNT–Ru can be calculated. The data in Table 1 show the peak area, relative sensitivity factor, and relative atom number of each element.

As shown in Table 1, it can be deduced that there is 1 ruthenium atom, 15 nitrogen atoms, 1 chlorine atom, 24 fluorine atoms, and 4 phosphorus atoms for every 314 carbon atoms in the MWCNT–Ru complex. Considering the test results of MWCNT–py, and taking into account the charge–neutrality principle, it can be concluded that there are four pyrrolidine pyridine moieties for every 262 MWCNT carbon atoms. One of the four pyridine moieties, together with two bipyridine and one chlorine ion, formed a six-coordinate complex with ruthenium(II) and combines a PF6− ion as the counterion. Each of the other three pyridine moieties combined with an NH4PF6 molecule by electrostatic attraction. It is evident that the substitutions are different between MWCNT–py and C60–py. The C60–py and a NH3 replaced a Cl− and a bipyridine of Ru(II)(bpy)2Cl2 to produce a five-coordinate complex [Ru(bpy)(NH3)(C60–py)Cl]PF6, whereas the MWCNT–py replaced the ligand Cl− to generate a six-coordinate complex [Ru(bpy)2 (MWCNT–py)Cl]PF6. This may be due to differences in the electron-withdrawing ability of C60–py and MWCNT–py.
The thermal behavior of p-MWCNTs, MWCNT–py, and MWCNT–Ru were studied under standard atmosphere at temperatures ranging from ambient temperature to 900 °C, as shown in Fig. 7. The TGA curve of MWCNT–Ru shows that there are three obvious weight-loss stages from room temperature to 900 °C. A weight loss of approximately 8.9% occurred from room temperature to 249 °C due to the decomposition of the three uncoordinated pyridine moieties. A weight loss of approximately 24.4% occurred in the range of 249–427 °C, and was ascribed to the decomposition of the ruthenium coordination unit and NH4PF6 molecule. A weight loss of 66.7% in the range of 427–650 °C was attributed to the combustion of the MWCNTs. These TGA data were consistent with the XPS results. The thermal stability of the MWCNT skeletons of p-MWCNTs, MWCNT–py, and MWCNT–Ru were determined by their thermal decomposition temperatures. The decomposition temperatures of p-MWCNTs and the MWCNT–py are 591 and 564 °C, respectively, indicating that the thermal stability of the MWCNTs decreased after the addition of pyridine-4-carbaldehyde to MWCNTs. The decomposition temperature of about 489 °C for the MWCNT skeleton of MWCNT–Ru is much lower than that of p-MWCNTs and MWCNT–py, thus, demonstrating that the thermal stability of the carbon-based skeleton decreased further after coordination with the metal moiety.

Fig. 8 shows the cyclic voltammetry curves recorded at a scan rate of 200 mV s−1 for C60–Ru, C60–py, and Ru(bpy)2Cl2. In the potential range from −1.1 to 1.5 V, C60–Ru displayed three reversible redox couples (A1-1/B1-1; A1-2/B1-2; A1-3/B1-3). The uncoordinated ligand C60–py showed two reversible couples (A2-1/B2-1 and A2-2/B2-2). Clearly, the reduction site in the C60–Ru complex is located on the ligand C60–py. This is similar to the results reported in the literature.30

Both A1-1/B1-1 and A1-2/B1-2 couples were from the first one electron reduction–oxidation (C60−–Ru/C60–Ru) and the second one electron reduction–oxidation (C602−–Ru/C60−–Ru), respectively. However, the reversibility of the voltammetric processes was seriously affected by chemical irreversibility. The reduction potentials of A1-1 and A1-2 shifted positively by 0.040 and 0.055 V compare to A2-1 and A2-2(Table 2), indicating that the C60–py moiety in the C60–Ru complex is more easily reduced than the uncoordinated C60–py. This may be ascribed to the ligand C60–py donating electron density to the Ru(II) metal center, which resulted in the decrease of the electron density of C60–py in the C60–Ru complex generated from the irreversible substitution reaction.
In the potential range from −1.1 to 1.5 V, Ru(bpy)2Cl2 showed two reversible redox couples (A5-1/B5-1 and A5-3/B5-3). A5-3/B5-3 was attributed to the reversible one-electron oxidation–reduction of ruthenium(II)/ruthenium(III). A5-1/B5-1 was presumably due to the reduction of oxygen traces. The voltammetric behavior of C60–Ru is greatly different from that of the Ru(bpy)2Cl2 precursor. In going from the six-coordinate complex of Ru(bpy)2Cl2 to the five-coordinate complex of C60–Ru, the oxidation–reduction potential changed a lot. C60–Ru exhibited a reversible one-electron redox couple A1-3/B1-3 in a region of high positive potential. This redox couple was attributed to the reversible redox of ruthenium(II)/ruthenium(III) wherein the half-wave potential shifted by 0.521 V to a more positive potential with respect to that of A5-3/B5-3. This may be ascribed to the connection of the pyridine ring with the strong electron-withdrawing C60 and results in a more significant MLCT effect in C60–Ru.
The uncoordinated MWCNT–py exhibited a reduction peak at around −0.458 V (A4-1) (Fig. 9), which is related to the van Hove singularity.31,32 MWCNT–Ru showed two reversible oxidation-reduction couples (A3-1/B3-1, A3-3/B3-3). The A3-1/B3-1 couple was assigned to the reduction of oxygen traces. The one-electron redox couple, ruthenium(II)/ruthenium(III), shifted to a more positive potential from A5-3/B5-3 for Ru(bpy)2Cl2 to A3-3/B3-3 for MWCNT–Ru. The positive shift in the potential of the redox couples is attributed to MWCNT–py donating less electron density to the Ru(II) metal center with respect to the substituted ligand of Cl−. However, MWCNT–Ru did not exhibit the reduction peak at about −0.5 V, which may be ascribed to the destruction of the conjugate π electronic structures of CNTs and the resultant disappearance of the van Hove singularity.27–29,33 Although both A3-3/B3-3 and A1-3/B1-3 couples shifted to a positive potential, the shifting degree of the A1-3/B1-3 couple was greater than that of A3-3/B3-3, indicating that MWCNT–py donates more electron density to the Ru(II) metal center than C60–py in the solution state. This may be due to MWCNTs being less electron-withdrawing than C60, thus, resulting in a more effective electron donor in MWCNT–py.

Conclusions
The carbon-based pyridine derivatives of C60 and MWCNT were prepared via 1,3-dipolar addition under a nitrogen atmosphere. In the preparation of C60–py, multi-pyridine derivatives with high solubility would be produced if the other reactants were in excess. All the carbon-based derivatives exhibited good stability. Based on this premise, the carbon-based ruthenium complex was prepared using Ru(II)(bpy)2Cl2 as a reactant. NH4PF6 was added to provide the PF6− ion that would be substituted for Cl−. This exchange of counterions from Cl− to PF6− makes the resulting complex less polar and easily soluble in organic solvents. Because of differences in the electron-withdrawing effect of the substituted ligands, the resulting products are different for C60–py and MWCNT–py. The C60–py and a NH3 replaced a Cl− and a bipyridine of Ru(II)(bpy)2Cl2 to produce a five-coordinate complex of [Ru(bpy)(NH3)(C60–py)Cl]PF6, whereas the MWCNT–py replaced the ligand Cl− to generate a six-coordinate complex of [Ru(bpy)2(MWCNT–py)Cl]PF6. The CV results indicated that the electron-withdrawing ability is different for C60 and MWCNT. C60 showed a relatively stronger electron-withdrawing effect with respect to MWCNT.

        Experimental methods and materials
Pristine MWCNTs (95% nanotube purity, p-MWCNTs) grown by chemical vapour deposition were purchased from Shenzhen Nanotech Port Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China) (purity > 95%, diameter: 10–30 nm; length: 1–2 μm). [60]Fullerene (C60) was purchased from Wuda Three-dimensional Carbon Cluster Materials Co., Ltd. in Wuhan City. These carbon materials were used directly without further processing.

        Ru(bpy)2Cl2 was synthesized according to the literature methods.34,35 A mixture of RuCl3 (0.31 g, 1.50 mmol), bipyridine (bipy, 0.468 g, 3 mmol), and LiCl·H2O (0.60 g) in dimethylformamide (DMF, 2.5 ml) was stirred and heated in reflux under a N2 atmosphere for 8 h. After cooling to room temperature, 12.5 ml of reagent-grade acetone was added. The mixture was maintained at 0 °C overnight to precipitate the crude product, and then centrifuged and washed three times with distilled water, acetone, ethanol, and ethyl ether to yield 0.51 g of Ru(bpy)2Cl2.
Synthesis of C60–py: Toluene (36 ml) was added to C60 (100 mg, 0.138 mmol), sarcosine (74 mg, 0.83 mmol), and pyridine-4-carbaldehyde (25.8 μL, 0.166 mmol) under an inert atmosphere. After ultrasonic dissolution, the mixture was stirred and refluxed at 140–150 °C in an oil bath for 18 h. The resultant brown solution was centrifuged to remove the insoluble impurities, and concentrated to approximately 10 ml by vacuum distillation. The concentrated solution was applied to a column of alumina (neutral alumina, 15% deactivated). Toluene was the initial eluant to remove the unreacted C60, and was followed by toluene–acetonitrile (7:1, v/v). The third running fraction was collected and concentrated by removing the solvent through distillation under nitrogen. The yield was 15 mg of the brown target product.
Synthesis of MWCNT–py: Toluene (60 ml) was added to MWCNT (150 mg), sarcosine (74 mg, 0.83 mmol), and pyridine-4-carbaldehyde (0.5 ml) under an inert atmosphere. The mixture was sonicated for 30 min to obtain a suspension that was stirred and refluxed at 140–150 °C in an oil bath for 2 days. Another 0.5 ml of pyridine-4-carbaldehyde was added. The suspension was stirred and refluxed for another 3 days, cooled, and then filtered using a 0.22 μm pore-sized polycarbonate membrane. The residue was washed with distilled water, ethanol, and acetone to yield 100 mg of MWCNT–py.
Synthesis of [Ru(bpy)(NH3)(C60–py)Cl]PF6 (denoted as C60–Ru): NH4PF6 (61.2 mg, 0.38 mol) was added to a solution mixture of C60–py (33 mg, 0.038 mmol) in o-dichlorobenzene (15 ml) and Ru(bpy)2Cl2 (23.3 mg, 0.045 mmol) in 1,2-dichloroethane (30 ml), kept under an inert atmosphere. The mixture was stirred and refluxed at 120 °C for 6 h. After cooling, the 1,2-dichloroethane was removed by vacuum distillation. Toluene (30 ml) was added to the concentrated solution and the red–brown flocculent precipitate that was formed was centrifuged and washed three times with distilled water, toluene, ethanol, and ethyl ether. The yield was 21 mg of the brown target product. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 8.345 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2 H, bpyH), 8.206 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 4H), 8.026 (dd, J1 = 8.0 Hz, J2 = 7.6 Hz, 2H, bpyH), 7.751 (t, J = 7.6 Hz, 2H, bpyH), 7.626 (d, J = 4.8 Hz, 2H, pyH), 4.982 (d, J = 3.2 Hz, 1H, pyrrole ring CH2), 4.310 (d, J = 9.2 Hz, 1H, pyrrole ring CH2), 2.846 (s, 1H, pyrrole ring CH), 1.610 (s, 3H). Elemental analysis (%) calcd.: C, 71.56; H, 1.60; N, 5.35. Found (%): C,. 71.43; H, 1.82; N 5.54.
Synthesis of [Ru(bpy)(NH3)(MWCNT–Py)Cl]PF6 (denoted as MWCNT–Ru): o-dichlorobenzene (15 ml) was added to MWCNT–py (33 mg) under an inert atmosphere, and sonicated for 30 min to obtain a suspension. An excess of NH4PF6 (61.2 mg, 0.38 mol) and a solution of Ru(bpy)2Cl2 (46.6 mg) in 1,2-dichloroethane (30 ml) were added. The mixture was stirred and refluxed at 120 °C for 6 h. After cooling, the suspension was filtered using a 0.22 μm pore-sized polycarbonate membrane. The residue was washed three times with 10 ml of distilled water, toluene, ethanol, and ethyl ether to produce 22 mg of the black target product.
The samples were characterized by various standard analytical techniques, including mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, Ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), infrared spectroscopy (IR), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The MS spectra were recorded using a Biflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer and a Daltonics mass spectrometer of Bruker (Bremen, Germany); Elemental analysis was performed on a Vario EL III Elemental Analyser (Elementar, Germany); 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 400 spectrometer (400 MHz); The UV-vis absorption spectra were measured on a Shimadzu UV-2501 spectrophotometer. For a typical sample preparation, the suspension of the MWCNT-based ligand/complex in chloroform was sonicated for 1 h. The IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Avatar 360 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer using KBr pellets. The resonance Raman spectra were measured using a Renishaw 1000 Raman Spectroscope equipped with a 514.5 nm laser at room temperature. The solid samples were mounted on a glass slide. The maximum laser power on the samples was about 6 mW. The XPS spectra were recorded on a Quantum-2000 scanning ESCA microprobe with AlKa radiation. All the spectra were calibrated with the C1s photoemission peak at 284.5 eV for sp2 hybridized carbon and analyzed using a standard Gaussian curve fitting routine with a Shirley background subtraction. TGAs were conducted with a WCT-1C medium-temperature computer differential thermal balance under flowing air at a scan rate of 10 °C min−1.
Electrochemical experiments were carried out in a conventional three-electrode system, by using a platinum ball (d = 2.2 mm) as the working electrode, a square platinum sheet (1 cm2) as the auxiliary electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. Tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoborate (TBATFB, from Alfa Aesar) was used as the supporting electrolyte, chloroform and acetonitrile (chromatography pure, from China National Pharmaceutical Group Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) were used without further purification. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Voltammograms were recorded with a CHI 660 C electrochemical analyzer (Chen Hua Instrument Co., Shanghai, China) in deaerated CHCl3–acetonitrile (4:1, v/v) solution containing 0.10 M n-Bu4NBF4 at room temperature.
