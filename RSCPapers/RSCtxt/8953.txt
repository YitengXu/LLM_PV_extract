PSCs fabricated using p-doped homopolymer achieve a power conversion efficiency of 15.5%, comparable to that of cells incorporating p-doped spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. However, half-devices made with the polymer exhibit improved light and heat stability in comparison to those incorporating spiro-OMeTAD.
Introduction
Proper choice of hole-transport materials (HTM) is a key factor for efficient and stable lead-halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). HTMs are necessary to minimize the charge recombination that would occur at direct perovskite/hole-collecting electrode interfaces. Organic molecules, polymers, metallomacrocycles, and inorganic materials can be used as HTMs in PSCs.1 One of the widely used HTM in high-performance PSCs is spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(di-p-anisylamino)-9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene]). Favorable attributes include its ionization energy (IE), which is well-matched with that of the perovskite absorber layer, easy solution processability, good conductivity (when appropriately doped), electrochemical stability, and high glass-transition temperature. Nevertheless, many studies show that the use of spiro-OMeTAD (with additive/dopants) can limit the stability of PSCs.2 Crystallization3 and photo-oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD,4 as well as diffusion of electrode metal into the HTM layer,5 all lead to degradation of the PSC performance. Some of these drawbacks may potentially be addressed by using a polymeric material with similar electronic characteristics to spiro-OMeTAD. Here we report a polymeric HTM, P1, designed to have electronic properties similar to spiro-OMeTAD, and its incorporation in n-i-p PSCs (see Fig. 1). The polymeric approach could potentially prevent moisture, dopant, and electrode metal diffusion.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
Attaching one polymerizable group to the symmetrical spiro-OMeTAD was anticipated to be synthetically complex. However, the role of the spiro-linkage in spiro-OMeTAD is largely to ensure a high glass-transition temperature, which, in a polymer, can be largely compensated for by an appropriate polymer backbone. Furthermore, the electrochemical and optical properties are primarily determined by the two bis(di-p-anisylamino)fluorene “arms” of the structure.6 Thus, we chose to use a bis(di-p-anisylamino)fluorene building block, the 9-position of the fluorene providing an ideal site for introduction of a single polymerizable group, as in some of our previous work on bis(diarylamino)fluorene7 and di(carbazolyl)fluorene8 side-chain norbornene polymers as hole-transport and host materials for organic light-emitting diodes.
The synthesis of the hole-transporting monomer M1 was carried out as depicted in Fig. 2. First, bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine and protected-hydroxyl-functionalized 2,7-diiodofluorene were converted to 2 using a Buchwald and Hartwig coupling.9,10 The silyl ether 2 was deprotected to the hydroxyl-functionalized bis(diarylamino)fluorene 3 using tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran. Deprotonation of the alcohol with sodium hydride, followed by an esterification reaction with 5-norbornene-2-carbonyl chloride, gave a mixture of the endo and exo isomers of monomer M1. P1 was successfully synthesized using the Grubbs 2nd generation initiator (see Fig. 2). The polymer was soluble in a range of organic solvents including THF, chloroform, dichloromethane, and dichlorobenzene. A broadening of the 1H NMR peaks was observed, consistent with the formation of a polymer. Moreover, an appreciable downfield chemical shift corresponding to the norbornene alkene protons was observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of the polymer, consistent with ring-opening of the norbornene. Gel permeation chromatography (in CHCl3) also indicated formation of a polymer and suggested Mw = 101 kDa and Đ = 1.7.

Characterization of HTM
Electrochemical measurements on the monomer M1 in CH2Cl2/0.1 M Bu4NPF6 indicate two successive reversible oxidations at E1/2 = +0.57 V and +0.87 V vs. internal FeCp*+/02 (Cp* = η5-C5Me5; see Fig. 3A) reference. These values correspond to +0.01 and +0.31 V vs. FeCp+/02 and thus the first oxidation allows us to estimate a solid-state IE of 4.8 eV (using the relation give in the footnote of Table 1), which is the same as we obtain for spiro-OMeTAD in the same way. We also compared the optical properties of P1 and spiro-OMeTAD; as shown in Fig. 3B and Table 1, there are only small differences in the spectra.

Spiro-OMeTAD generally requires p-doping for satisfactory device performance. The most widely used approach to achieving this p-doping (i.e., partial oxidation to the spiro-OMeTAD radical cation) is to use Li-TFSI (50 mol%) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) (330 mol%) as additives in combination with exposure to air. Other dopants have been tried, including Mo(tfd-COCF3)3, which was used as a dopant for spiro-OMeTAD in n-i-p devices in which no other additive was needed, resulting in higher device stability than when Li-TFSI/tBP doped,11,12 presumably largely due to the absence of the hygroscopic lithium ion, which is thought to promote moisture-induced degradation of the perovskite.13 As expected from the similar redox potentials for spiro-OMeTAD and P1, optical absorption measurements upon addition of Li-TFSI/tBP or Mo(tfd-COCF3)3 to a solution containing P1 (see Fig. 4) show the growth of new peaks consistent with a bis(diarylamino)fluorene radical cation.

Half-device optical characterization
We aimed to characterize and compare the optical properties of half devices. The Li-TFSI/tBP-doped P1 and spiro-OMeTAD films spin-coated on top of a Cs0.05FA0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite film on clean glass showed similar PL quenching (PLQE = 0.02% in each case) compared to that of the bare perovskite film (PLQE = 0.28%) suggesting comparable losses due to non-radiative recombination at the perovskite/HTM interface, likely related to their similar structures and optical properties.
Deposition of some molecules with Lewis basic substituents on top of the perovskite has been suggested to passivate defects.15–18 Several studies, including ours, have found ester-containing materials can play a useful role in perovskite growth and/or passivation.19–22 The added ester moieties on the polymer could potentially bind to any undercoordinated lead ions at the surface, effectively screening the charge and reducing recombination. Photoluminescence (PL) lifetime experiments on films of perovskite in contact with doped P1 or spiro-OMeTAD (see Fig. 5) are consistent with this idea; the former exhibit longer lifetimes associated with bimolecular recombination. Moreover, the PL peak of the P1-containing film is blue-shifted compared to the spiro-OMeTAD one, which also suggests that there is passivation of trap states at the interface between the HTM and perovskite layers; removing shallow traps near the band edges effectively blue shifts the photoluminescence.23  where τ1 is the lifetime for fast, trap-assisted processes (Shockley-Read-Hall recombination), τ2 is the lifetime for slower bimolecular recombination, and A1 and A2 are the relative amplitudes, gave lifetimes τ1 = 7.4 ns and τ2 = 46.5 ns for the P1 sample, while the spiro-OMeTAD sample exhibits a decreased τ1 value of 5.9 ns and an increased τ2 lifetime of 80.9 ns. The perovskite on glass reference gave lifetimes τ1 = 8.9 ns and τ2 = 43.1 ns.

The PL maximum for the spiro-OMeTAD sample is slightly red-shifted relative to that of the P1 and the bare perovskite sample, which may indicate more band-bending due to shallow-trap formation in the spiro-OMeTAD case.7,8 (B) Fitting of the time-resolved PL of the glass/perovskite/HTM half devices using a biexponential decay. 
Half-device stability studies
In addition to possibly passivating the perovskite, it was hypothesized that the polymer could also better protect the perovskite from extrinsic factors (such as moisture or oxygen penetration) compared to the small spiro-OMeTAD molecule.24,25 In order to probe if the polymer P1 could improve the stability of the solar cells, we fabricated half-cells with the architecture FTO/Cs0.05FA0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3/HTMs (undoped) and heated them in an aging box (conditions: 85 °C, 76 mW cm−2, 50% relative humidity). We measured the PXRD of the half-cells over time by periodically moving the films to ambient conditions for the time of measurement (see Fig. 6A and B). After 20 h, the bare perovskite film no longer shows the (110) peak of the 3D perovskite at ∼14°, while the P1- and spiro-OMeTAD-coated films retained 50% and 25% of the peak intensity respectively, clearly showing the advantage of using the polymeric material. We also followed the decomposition of the perovskite by UV-vis spectroscopy (see Fig. 6C and D). After 48 h in the aging box, the spiro-OMeTAD-coated film turned gray and no longer showed a discernable onset of absorption at the perovskite band gap at ∼775 nm, while for the P1-containing film, this feature was still observable.

Device fabrication and characterization
We investigated the performance of the new HTM P1 in n-i-p PSCs using the following architecture; FTO/SnO2/FA0.85Cs0.15Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3/PEA-I/p-doped HTM/Ag, where FTO = fluorine-doped tin oxide, FA = formamidinium, HTM is spiro-OMeTAD or P1, and PEA-I is phenylethylammonium iodide, a known passivating agent.26 The devices using optimally p-doped P1 (for optimization of PEA-I, Li-TFSI, P1 and tBP concentration, see Fig. S1–S4 and Tables S1–S4, ESI‡) are reported in Fig. 6 and Table 2. We obtained a champion PCE of 15.5% for Li-TFSI-doped devices, which is similar to that for the control devices with doped spiro-OMeTAD (16.5%) (see Table S2, ESI‡).27–29 The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the best performing devices using Li-TFSI-doped spiro-OMeTAD and P1 recorded under simulated AM1.5, 1 sun irradiance are presented in Fig. 7. As it can be seen from Table, P1 and spiro-OMeTAD have similar performance with the averaged performance of P1 being slightly higher compared to spiro-OMeTAD. The reduced spread in the data also shows improved reproducibility over spiro-OMeTAD, which has previously been shown to form films with poor uniformity.18 Furthermore, the improved thermal and atmospheric stability of half devices with P1 suggest that the lifetime power output for devices based on P1 may be greater than those with spiro-OMeTAD.

Using spiro-OMeTAD ca. 1.5x more material (85 mg mL−1vs. 55 mg mL−1 for P1) is needed to obtain similar photovoltaic performance. The thickness of an optimal P1 layer was approximately half that of an optimal spiro-OMeTAD layer (∼100 nm vs. 200 nm as determined by profilometry). Both doped P1 and spiro-OMeTAD films have visible “comets”, as is typical for spiro-OMeTAD films. Careful optimization of Li-TFSI and tBP helps to decrease the density of pinholes (see Fig. S6, ESI‡) and to reach optimal device performance. For P1, the optimal Li-TFSI dopant concentration is 25 mol%, while that for spiro-OMeTAD is 50 mol%, which in both cases corresponds to oxidation of 1/4 of the bis(diarylamino)fluorene units. Moreover, PSCs made with P1 p-doped using Mo(tfd-COCF3)3 (see Fig. S5 and Table S5, ESI‡) were fabricated and achieved similar PCE (14.3 ± 0.9%).
Conclusion
In summary, we have described the use of a polymeric HTM analogue to spiro-OMeTAD in n-i-p PSCs. PCEs using P1 are as high as 15.5% similar to those obtained using the widely used HTM spiro-OMeTAD. Half-device stability under harsh conditions is also significantly improved when using P1, suggesting that it is a promising candidate for single junction and tandem solar cells.
