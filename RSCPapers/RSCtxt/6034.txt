The WO3 films were composed of WO3 nanoprism arrays, which were synthesized using a solvothermal method. After coating a single layer of Bi2S3 on top of the WO3 film, the resulting Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film showed enhanced photoelectrochemical activity. At 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the initial photocurrent density of the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film with one layer of Bi2S3 was 1.33 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 1.19 mA cm−2 in a 0.2 M NaCl mixed water–ethanol solution, which was 40% and 32% higher than the bare WO3 film under the same conditions, respectively. The optimal number of Bi2S3 layers for coupling with the WO3 film was found to be 3 layers, which had the highest photocurrent density and IPCE values. The photoelectrochemical activity of Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film was not stable for water oxidation due to photocorrosion in aqueous electrolyte, but it was stable in the NaCl mixed water–ethanol solution and a non-aqueous solution containing iodide/triiodide as a redox couple. The origin of enhanced photoelectrochemical activity of the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film was primarily ascribed to the band potential matching between WO3 and Bi2S3, which is advantageous for charge separation.1. IntroductionUtilization of solar energy, a renewable and abundant resource, has been considered to be a possible solution to counter the depletion of fossil fuels and environmental pollution. Since the discovery of electrochemical photolysis of water by TiO2 in 1972,1 countless attempts to develop semiconductor materials capable of capturing solar energy for photoelectrochemical applications have been made.2–4 In general, the photoelectrochemical process involves light absorption and subsequent charge separation in the semiconductor, which are decisive factors affecting a material's photoelectrochemical activity.5,6 Although many semiconductors show photoelectrochemical activity under sunlight, most of them are unsatisfactory because of either narrow spectral response range or high charge carrier recombination. For example, photoelectrochemical water oxidation by TiO2 suffers from low photo-conversion efficiency due to its wide bandgap (3.0–3.2 eV) only allowing for absorption of the UV portion of the solar spectrum (λ < 390 nm, less than 5% of the full solar energy).6 On the other hand, Fe2O3 has a narrow bandgap of 2.2 eV, but its photoelectrochemical activity is limited by high charge carrier recombination, which prevents useful extraction of solar energy.7,8 Aiming to alleviate these issues, several strategies have been developed recently, such as optimization of the morphology,9 substitutional doping,10,11 the addition of electrocatalysts12,13 and the formation of a heterojunction between two semiconductors with matched band potentials.14,15Tungsten trioxide (WO3) has been considered a promising material for photoelectrochemical applications due to its suitable bandgap (approximately 2.7 eV),16 moderate resistance against photocorrosion17 and long hole-diffusion length (approximately 500 nm) compared to other metal oxides.18 Nevertheless, as with many semiconductors, the poor charge separation and sluggish photoelectrochemical kinetics in WO3 limit its photo-conversion efficiency.19,20 To improve its photoelectrochemical activity, we propose a heterojunction photocatalyst with WO3 coupled to a suitable narrow bandgap semiconductor in order to enhance light absorption and improve charge separation. Namely, by appropriate matching of the band potentials, the photo-induced carriers in the heterojunction photocatalyst will be purposefully driven through both the WO3 and the coupled semiconductor.With respect to the selection of a semiconductor to couple with WO3, bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) may be a good candidate. Bi2S3 has a narrow direct bandgap reported to be between 1.3 and 1.9 eV,21,22 which can capture visible light to drive a photoelectrochemical reaction. In order to evaluate the feasibility of coupling WO3 with Bi2S3 to form an effective heterojunction photocatalyst, the relative band positions of WO3 and Bi2S3 were calculated empirically according to formulae (1) and (2):16,23 ECB = X − 0.5Eg + E0(1) EVB = Eg + ECB(2)where ECB is the conduction band edge, EVB is the valence band edge, Eg is the bandgap, E0 is a scale factor relating the reference electrode redox level to the absolute vacuum scale (E0 = −4.5 eV for the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)), and X is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor. The value of X for WO3 and Bi2S3 are 6.59 and 5.28 eV, respectively.16,24,25 According to the formulae above and the typical Eg of WO3 (2.7 eV) and Bi2S3 (1.4 eV) reported in the literature,16,21 the ECB and EVB values of WO3 were calculated to be 0.74 and 3.44 eV vs. NHE, respectively. ECB and EVB values of Bi2S3 correspond to 0.08 and 1.48 eV vs. NHE, respectively. It is seen that the ECB and EVB of WO3 are more positive than those of Bi2S3, which are favourable for the separation and transport of charge carriers. Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the band positions between WO3 and Bi2S3. Thus the calculated results indicated that the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction photocatalyst is a potential high photoactivity catalyst in comparison to bare WO3. Herein, we investigate the photoelectrochemical properties of a Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film that was formed via coupling a WO3 nanoprism array film with urchin-like Bi2S3 nanospheres.

Experimental2.1 Material synthesisThe Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction films were synthesized on FTO coated glass substrates (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm, Pilkington, TEC15). The WO3 films were synthesized by the solvothermal method as reported elsewhere but with some significant modifications,15 including the capping agent, solvent ratio and FTO coated glass substrates. The typical experimental procedure was as follows: 0.25 g H2WO4 (99+%, Acros Organics) was dissolved into 4 mL H2O by adding 1 mL H2O2 (30 wt%, Fisher Chemical) and intensely stirring at 100 °C. Then 0.7 mL HCl (37 wt%, Fisher Chemical), 0.062 g oxalic acid dihydrate (98+%, Fisher Chemical) and a 30 mL mixture of H2O and ethanol (Fisher Chemical) with varying volume ratios of water to ethanol (Vwater:Vethanol) were added into the H2WO4 solution. After that, the as-prepared solution was transferred to a 120 mL Teflon-lined autoclave (Parr Instrument Co.) and four pieces of bare FTO glass were put into and placed vertically at the bottom of the Teflon-vessel. The autoclave was then sealed and maintained at 180 °C for 4 h. The FTO substrates were taken out when the reaction was complete and rinsed with H2O and ethanol several times and dried at 60 °C in ambient air. Finally, the as-grown films were annealed in air at 550 °C for 2 h.Bi2S3 was also synthesized by a solvothermal technique.26 Briefly, 0.97 g Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (99.99%, Acros Organics) and 0.456 g thiourea ((NH2)2CS, 99+%, Acros Organics) were dissolved in a 50 mL mixture of H2O and ethylene glycol (EG, Fisher Chemical) with a volume ratio of VH2O:VEG = 1:4 in a 120 mL Teflon-lined autoclave (Parr Instrument Co.). The autoclave was then sealed and maintained at 140 °C for 45 min, followed by natural cooling to room temperature. The products were separated centrifugally and washed with H2O and ethanol several times, and then dispersed in 10 mL H2O containing 0.25 wt% poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, 99–100% hydrolyzed, approx MW 86000, Acros Organics). In order to ensure consistency and repeatability, we define one layer Bi2S3 film as 100 μL dispersed Bi2S3 liquid coated on 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm FTO-glass substrate or WO3 film. The Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction films were formed by drip-coating a top layer of Bi2S3 onto the WO3 layer.2.2 Material characterizationScanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired using a Zeiss Supra 40 VP SEM with 5 kV accelerating voltage. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were taken on a Rigaku Spider X-ray diffractometer using powder samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD system with monochromated Al-Kα radiation. UV-vis transmission measurements were performed with a Cary 500 UV-vis-NIR spectrometer attached to a Labsphere DRA-CA-5500 integrating sphere. For Tauc plots the absorption coefficient (α) was determined by:α = −ln(10−Absorbance)/zwhere z is the film thickness.The electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted using a three-electrode cell, which had a main compartment for the working electrode and two branched compartments separated by fritted disks (Ace Glass, 10–20 μm porosity) for the counter electrode and reference electrode. The working electrode was the as synthesized film which was pressed against an O-ring on the main compartment. It had a backside mask so that the active area was approximately 0.22 cm2 for both frontside and backside illumination measurements. The counter electrode was a 1 mm diameter Pt wire (99.95%, Alfa Aesar) and the reference electrode was Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl, CH Instruments, CH111). Each compartment of the cell was filled from the same stock of electrolyte solution. The pH of the solution was checked using a bench top pH meter (OAKTON). A CH Instruments 660D electrochemical workstation was employed for the electrochemical measurements.The illumination source was a 150 W xenon lamp (Newport, Model 9600) with an AM 1.5 filter (Newport). For white light measurements the lamp was positioned to provide approximately 100 mW cm−2 irradiation on the film as measured by a thermopile detector (Newport, Models 1916C and 818-UV). IPCE measurements were conducted using a full solar simulator (Newport, Model 9600, 150 W xenon lamp) with an AM 1.5 filter and a motorized monochromator (Oriel Cornerstone 130 1/8 m). The monochromator slit size was adjusted to 0.75 mm × 2 mm providing monochromatic wavelengths and a power density which could be adjusted from 12.8 and 197.7 μW cm−2 of irradiation for wavelengths between 340 and 620 nm. A typical light power density used for IPCE measurement can be found in Fig. S8.† The light power at each wavelength was measured using a handheld optical power meter with a UV enhanced silicon photo-detector (Newport, Models 1916C and 818-UV). The IPCE is expressed by following equation:IPCE = (1240 × I)/(λ × Plight)where I is the measured photocurrent density at a specific wavelength, λ is the wavelength of incident light and Plight is the measured light power density at that wavelength.Mott–Schottky measurements were conducted using a CH Instruments 660D and the built in software was used to measure capacitance vs. applied potential. Mott–Schottky plots were created and fit to the ideal semiconductor behaviour:1/C2 = (2/eεε0Nd)[Va − Vfb − kT/e]where C is the space charge layer capacitance, ε is the dielectric constant of the material, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, e is the elemental charge, Nd is the concentration of charge carriers, Va is the applied potential, Vfb is the flat band potential, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.3. Results and discussionTo optimize the photoelectrochemical activity of the WO3 films, different morphologies of WO3 were synthesized on bare FTO coated glass substrates using the solvothermal method with different volume ratios of water to ethanol (Vwater:Vethanol). The dependence of the nanostructure on the Vwater:Vethanol ratio is shown in the ESI, Fig. S1.† The film, as grown on the FTO-glass substrate was identified as WO3·0.33H2O before annealing. X-ray diffraction results are shown in the subsequent section. The WO3·0.33H2O nanostructures were sheetlike when grown with Vwater:Vethanol = 6:0, 5:1, 4:2, 2:4, 1:5 and 0:6 (see Fig. S1a–c and S1e–g†). However, when Vwater:Vethanol = 3:3, dense WO3·0.33H2O nanoprism arrays with an average length of 2 μm and cross-sections of 50–150 nm grew perpendicularly on the FTO-glass substrate (Fig. S1d and h†). The morphology dependence of the WO3·0.33H2O on the selected Vwater:Vethanol may be ascribed to the effect of solvent on the kinetics and thermodynamics during growth of the crystal.27,28 The film morphology observed here is often considered to be advantageous for achieving higher photoelectrochemical efficiency by creating a large film/electrolyte interfacial area, making a large proportion of the light absorbing volume in the depletion region and reducing the charge transport length compared to a thick, dense film. After annealing in air at 550 °C for 2 h to convert the WO3·0.33H2O into monoclinic WO3, the photoelectrochemical activity of the films was studied in 0.1 M Na2SO4 and the results are shown in Fig. S2.† The WO3 film synthesized at Vwater:Vethanol = 3:3 consistently showed the highest photocurrent under illumination suggesting that the nanoprism array structure has better photoelectrochemical activity than the sheetlike structures produced using other Vwater:Vethanol ratios. Thus, Vwater:Vethanol = 3:3 was used to synthesize WO3 films to couple with Bi2S3 for subsequent experiments.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a Bi2S3 film coated on a FTO-coated glass substrate is shown in Fig. 2a, in which urchin shaped Bi2S3 nanospheres were observed with diameters in the range of 0.8–1.5 μm. The high-magnification SEM (inset of Fig. 2a) and TEM (Fig. 2e) images reveal that each urchin-like Bi2S3 sphere is composed of nanorods radiating from the center of the sphere with diameters of about 50 nm. Fig. 2b and c show the SEM images of an annealed WO3 film on a FTO-glass substrate and Fig. 2f shows the TEM image of an individual WO3 nanoprism. Compared to the morphology of the unannealed film (inset of Fig. 2b), the edges of nanoprisms became round with dehydration during annealing,35 but the length was unchanged. Fig. 2d presents the SEM image of a Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film, in which one layer of Bi2S3 was coated on top of the WO3. Fig. 2  (a) Top-view SEM images of urchin-like Bi2S3 spheres coated on FTO-glass substrate. Inset is the magnified image. (b) Top-view SEM image of the as annealed WO3 nanoprism arrays.

(e) TEM image of Bi2S3 spheres. (f) TEM image of WO3 nanoprism. Fig. 3a displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of several different samples. In the Bi2S3 pattern, all diffraction peaks are indexed as orthorhombic Bi2S3 (JCPDS 00-017-0320). For the unannealed WO3 film, the characteristic diffraction peaks that appear in the pattern agree well with orthorhombic WO3·0.33H2O (JCPDS 01-0873-1203). After annealing in air at 550 °C for 2 h, the orthorhombic WO3·0.33H2O was converted into monoclinic WO3 (JCPDS 01-083-0947) via dehydration and phase transition.29 The monoclinic phase of WO3 has been shown to possess higher photoelectrochemical activity than other crystal phases.30,31 Both orthorhombic Bi2S3 and monoclinic WO3 peaks are shown in the pattern after coating a single Bi2S3 layer on top of WO3, indicating the formation of a Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film. The surface composition and chemical states of an as synthesized Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film were further characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As expected, the corresponding characteristic peaks for W, O, Bi and S all appeared in the survey XPS spectrum (Fig. 3b). The C1s peak was used as a reference point and can be attributed to CO2 adsorbed onto the film from the atmosphere as well as adventitious carbon. As shown in Fig. 3c, the binding energies of W4f5/2 and W4f7/2 peaks located at 37.9 and 36.0 eV, respectively, are consistent with the standard W6+ peaks in WO3.32 In Fig. 3d, the Bi4f5/2 and Bi4f7/2 peaks with a typical spin–orbit doublet splitting of 5.4 eV are observed at 164.0 and 158.6 eV, respectively, matching closely the standard Bi3+ peaks in Bi2S3.33 The peaks found between Bi4f5/2 and Bi4f7/2 are assigned to S2p1/2 (162.5 eV) and S2p3/2 (161.3 eV). Additionally, the O1s peak at 530.8 eV and the S2speak at 225.5 eV are consistent with O2− in WO3 and S2− in sulfide, respectively (see Fig. S3†).32,34 Fig. 3  (a) XRD patterns of Bi2S3, WO3·0.33H2O, WO3 and Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film. (b) Survey XPS spectrum of Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film. (c) High-resolution W4f XPS spectrum. (d) High-resolution Bi4f XPS spectrum. The optical behaviour of the films was investigated by UV-vis or Vis-NIR absorbance spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 4a, the bare WO3 has a clear absorption edge around 460 nm, which corresponds well with its indirect band gap energy. For the bare Bi2S3 film, the onset of light absorption is in the near-infrared region consistent with its narrow direct bandgap and visible–light activity (see Fig. 4b). Compared with the bare WO3 film, the light absorption characteristics of the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film was significantly enhanced over the entire testing region. Similar band absorption edges for the WO3 and Bi2S3 film were found in the spectrum of the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film around 460 nm and 930 nm. From the absorbance spectra, the optical bandgaps of the WO3 and Bi2S3 films were calculated by the Tauc equation. As shown in Fig. 4c and d, the Tauc plots point to a band gap of 2.70 eV for the WO3 film and 1.33 eV for the Bi2S3 film, which are close to the reported bandgaps for WO3 and Bi2S3 synthesized by other methods.35,36 Fig. 4  (a) UV-vis absorbance spectra of WO3 film and UV-vis-NIR absorbance spectrum of Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film. (b) Vis-NIR absorbance spectrum of Bi2S3 film. Tauc plots of (c) WO3 film and (d) Bi2S3 film. The difference in photoelectrochemical activity of the as-prepared films illuminated from the front (through the electrolyte to film) and the back (through the FTO-glass substrate to film) was first checked by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). Fig. 5 shows the LSV collected from a single layer Bi2S3 film, the WO3 film, and a single Bi2S3 layer/WO3 heterojunction film in 0.1 M Na2SO4 without irradiation and under white light (simulated solar 100 mW cm−2) frontside and backside illumination. The photocurrents obtained under backside illumination of the films were significantly higher than that under frontside illumination. Similar results have been found in other research relating to photocatalysts on FTO-coated glass substrates for water oxidation.15,37 Such differences can be attributed to the separated region of charge carriers and utilization of different wavelengths of light in the film. In work by Lindström et al.,38 they found the most efficient charge separation takes place close to the back contact in the sintered colloidal TiO2 films. For the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film under backside illumination, the WO3 film which the light encounters first absorbs the short wavelength light (λ < 460 nm) to generate charge carriers and the longer wavelength light (λ > 460 nm) can penetrate through the WO3 film and then be absorbed by the Bi2S3 layer. For frontside illumination, due to the narrow bandgap Bi2S3 stacked on top of the heterojunction film, most of the light will be absorbed by the Bi2S3 layer with only a small quantity of light reaching the WO3 film and because the valence band edge in Bi2S3 is not positive enough to provide sufficient overpotential, most of the photogenerated holes in that layer of the film aren't able to efficiently oxidize water.4,39 Therefore it is noteworthy that frontside illumination of the Bi2S3/WO3 film shows higher photocurrent than frontside illumination of the WO3 film. It implies the higher photoactivity of the Bi2S3/WO3 film may be due to improved light absorption as well as charge separation. Since all films illuminated with white light from the backside had better photoelectrochemical activity, the photoelectrochemical measurements in the subsequent reported work were performed using backside illumination. Fig. 5  LSV scans for (a) single Bi2S3 layer film, (b) WO3 film and (c) 1 layer Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film in 0.1 M Na2SO4 without irradiation (dark) and under illumination with different white light direction (100 mW cm−2). The scan rate was 50 mV s−1. Fig. 6a shows the LSV collected from the films in 0.1 M Na2SO4 illuminated with chopped white light of 100 mW cm−2 intensity. A weak photocurrent was observed for a single Bi2S3 layer film upon illumination in the applied potential range. The WO3 film shows a more pronounced photoresponse, which starts around 0.15 V vs. Ag/AgCl and gradually increases with applied potential. The photocurrent density for the WO3 film reached a value of 0.95 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. For the single Bi2S3 layer coated WO3 heterojunction film there is enhanced photoresponse and a negatively shifted photocurrent onset potential. The onset potential for the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film was around 0.05 V compared to 0.15 V for WO3 film. The photocurrent on the heterojunction film reached 1.33 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is a 40% enhancement compared to bare WO3 film at the same potential. To check the possibility that the higher photocurrent obtained on the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film was merely due to photocorrosion of Bi2S3 we repeated the photoelectrochemical tests in a mixed solution of water and ethanol containing 0.2 M NaCl, in which ethanol can act as sacrificial electron donor to prevent the photocorrosion of Bi2S3.40 The solution was prepared by dissolving 0.2 M NaCl in a mixture of water and ethanol with a volume ratio of Vwater:Vethanol = 1:2. Fig. 6b shows the chopped LSV scans for the films in this solution illuminated with white light of 100 mW cm−2 intensity. It is seen that the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film still presents higher photocurrent than Bi2S3 and WO3 film. At 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the photocurrent densities of WO3 and Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film were 0.90 and 1.19 mA cm−2, respectively, which means that the photocurrent was improved 32% when a single Bi2S3 layer was coated on top of a WO3 film. In addition, we have conducted the chopped LSV measurements in a non-aqueous solution containing the iodide/triiodide redox couple. The solution was prepared by dissolving 10 mM I2 and 50 mM NaI in ethanol, which leads to an iodide: triiodide ratio of 4:1. The results show that the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film has higher photoelectrochemical activity than Bi2S3 film and WO3 film in this non-aqueous solution (see Fig. S4†). The photocurrent densities obtained for our Bi2S3 films are much lower than the theoretical maximal current density of Bi2S3, which is about 35 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5 G illumination based on its bandgap.41 Potential reasons are as follows: (1) the valence band edge of Bi2S3 is not positive enough to provide the required kinetic overpotential for some oxidation reactions including water oxidation;4 (2) Bi2S3 likely has a high recombination rate of hole–electron pairs leading to lower photocurrent densities. These results confirm that WO3 couples with Bi2S3 to form a heterojunction structure which improves activity for photoelectrochemical oxidation reactions. Fig. 6  Chopped LSV scans for single layer Bi2S3 film, WO3 film and 1 layer Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film in (a) 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6.9) and (b) in a mixed solution of water and ethanol containing 0.2 M NaCl (pH = 6.8) under illumination with 100 mW cm−2 white light. The scan rate was 50 mV s−1. In order to understand the origin of the photoelectrochemical activity enhancement in the heterojunction film, the flat band potentials for WO3 and Bi2S3 were measured. Fig. 7 presents the Mott–Schottky plots (1/C2vs. V) measured at different frequencies for a single layer Bi2S3 film and a bare WO3 film in 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.2 M NaCl mixed water–ethanol solution. The Mott–Schottky plots of the Bi2S3 film showed quasi-linear behavior both in 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.2 M NaCl mixed water–ethanol solution. The slope of the plot indicates that the flat band potential for Bi2S3 film is in the range of −1.02 to −1.22 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Super linear behaviour was observed for the WO3 film in 0.1 M Na2SO4, which may be ascribed to a decrease in the active surface area of the nanostructured film as a function of potential. Similar behaviour for Mott–Schottky plots was observed by Cesar et al. on Si-doped nanostructured α-Fe2O3 film.42 They explained that when the nanoscale features on the electrode surface become fully depleted they no longer contribute to the effective capacitive surface area, resulting in a changing capacitance with potential. The flat band potential for WO3 was estimated between −0.17 and 0.35 V vs. Ag/AgCl according to the slope in the quasi-linear region of the Mott–Schottky plots in 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.2 M NaCl mixed water–ethanol solution. The conduction band edge in many n-type semiconductors is often considered to be more negative by about 0.1 V than its flat band potential.43 Therefore, although we have certain deviations in the measured values of flat band potential due to the nanoscale features on the electrode surface, it can still be inferred that the valence band edge of WO3 is more positive than that of Bi2S3 by combining these results with the optical bandgap values obtained by UV-vis. As a result, the photogenerated holes in WO3 can be transferred to Bi2S3 due to the valence band potential difference. At the same time the photogenerated electrons in Bi2S3 are transferred to WO3 due to the ECB offset. Consequently, the physical separation of electrons and holes should improve the photoelectrochemical activity. Fig. 7  Mott–Schottky plots for single layer Bi2S3 film and WO3 film. The measurements were conducted in 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.2 M NaCl mixed water–ethanol solution. The stability of the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film was investigated by chronoamperometry. For the sake of comparison, the stability of a single-layer Bi2S3 film and a WO3 film were also investigated. Fig. 8 shows the amperometric i–t results that were measured in 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.2 M NaCl mixed water–ethanol solution at a constant applied potential of 1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) under illumination. After several minutes of testing, we observed small bubbles forming on the WO3 and Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction films, suggesting oxygen production from water oxidation. A pipette was used to flush off the bubbles on the films during stability measurement, but this lead to some reaction destabilization. The prominent points in the amperometric i–t curves were caused by bubble removal. As shown in Fig. 8a, the photocurrent density for the Bi2S3 film in 0.1 M Na2SO4 drops about 69% after 3600 seconds of illumination. The photocurrent of the WO3 film dropped by about 43% after 3600 seconds, which is mainly ascribed to photocorrosion and OH− in the electrolyte solution inducing WO3 chemical dissolution (WO3(s) + OH− = WO42−(aq.) + H+).44,45 The photocurrent density of the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film in 0.1 M Na2SO4 dropped about 46% within the first 1000 seconds, and then decreased slowly in subsequent testing, in which the total loss in activity was about 54%. Significantly, the photocurrent density of the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film was higher than that of the WO3 film during 3600 seconds illumination. XPS analysis of the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction reveals that the atomic ratio of Bi/S decreased from 2/3 to 1.8/3 after the stability testing. Furthermore, the SEM images acquired from the Bi2S3 layer shows that the urchin-like Bi2S3 spheres were destroyed to a certain extent after 3600 seconds of illumination during stability testing (Fig. S5†). Therefore, the majority of the photocurrent decay of the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film in 0.1 M Na2SO4 can be attributed to the photocorrosion of the Bi2S3 layer. However, the photoelectrochemical activity of the WO3 film and Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film was stable in 0.2 M NaCl mixed water–ethanol solution and 10 mM I2 and 50 mM NaI in ethanol due to the protection provided by ethanol against photocorrosion and the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film possesses enhanced photoactivity (Fig. 8b and S6†). The chopped LSV scans conducted before and after i–t measurements in 0.2 M NaCl mixed water–ethanol solution further confirmed the photoactivity of Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film over WO3 film and both are stable in this solution (Fig. S7†). Fig. 8  Amperometric i–t curve for single layer Bi2S3 film, WO3 film and 1 layer Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film in (a) 0.1 M Na2SO4 and (b) 0.2 M NaCl mixed water–ethanol solution at a constant applied potential of 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The photoelectrochemical results above suggest that coupling Bi2S3 with WO3 improves the photoelectrochemical activity relative to WO3. In order to quantitatively investigate the relation between the photoelectrochemical activity and the wavelength of the incident light, incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed. Fig. 9 shows the IPCE spectra for the WO3 film, the single layer Bi2S3 film, and the 1 layer Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.2 M NaCl mixed water–ethanol solution. As shown in Fig. 9, the bare Bi2S3 film shows low IPCE over the entire testing wavelength region both in 0.1 M Na2SO4 and the 0.2 M NaCl mixed water–ethanol solution. For the WO3 film, a photoresponse was observed from 340 to 460 nm, which is in agreement with its bandgap. In comparison with the WO3 film, the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film exhibited enhanced IPCE over the entire testing region. In particular, in the short wavelength region (λ < 460 nm), an IPCE signal that was distinctly enhanced but similar in shape to the bare WO3 film was observed. Additionally, compared to the bare Bi2S3 film, the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film showed enhanced IPCE values in the long wavelength region (460–620 nm), however, the amount of enhancement is less distinguishable in the long wavelength range due to measurement noise, especially in 0.1 M Na2SO4. On the other hand, the photocurrent values from the integrated IPCE have a little deviation to the photocurrent obtained from the chopped LSV that were conducted at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which can be ascribed to the light intensity dependence of the photocurrent density for the Bi2S3 film and the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film (see Fig. S9†). The IPCE measurements were conducted under lower light intensity (<1 mW cm−2), so less electrons and holes were generated and the recombination probability was less than under illumination with at 100 mW cm−2. This result indicates that the short wavelength light (λ < 460 nm) was mainly absorbed by the WO3 film and the long wavelength light (λ > 460 nm) penetrated through the WO3 film and was absorbed by the Bi2S3 layer. Consequently, we conclude that the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film has combined the merits of the two semiconductors and favorably harvested photons for photoelectrochemical reactions. Fig. 9  IPCE spectra for single layer Bi2S3 film, WO3 film and 1 layer Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film in (a) 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution and (b) 0.2 M NaCl mixed water–ethanol solution at a constant applied potential of 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The thickness of the Bi2S3 film coated on top of the WO3 film may have influence on the formation of the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction and the light absorbance, which are thought to be important factors in the photoelectrochemical activity of composite films.14,15 To investigate these effects multiple layers of Bi2S3 films ranging from 1 to 4 were coated on top of the WO3 film for photoelectrochemical oxidation. Fig. 10a and c show the LSV of Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction films comprised of a single WO3 layer and multiple Bi2S3 layers in 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.2 M NaCl mixed water–ethanol solution under white light illumination, respectively. The photoresponse for the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction films gradually increased for up to three Bi2S3 layers, with a decreased value obtained for four Bi2S3 layers coated on the WO3 film. For example, in 0.1 M Na2SO4, for a single Bi2S3 layer coated on a WO3 film, the photocurrent density was 1.33 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. When three Bi2S3 layers were coated on WO3, the photocurrent value achieved a maximum current density of 1.75 mA cm−2. The IPCE results further confirmed the relationship between the Bi2S3 coating layers and the photoelectrochemical activity of the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film. As shown in Fig. 10b and d, in the wavelength region of 340–460 nm, the IPCE values of the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film increased with the number of coating Bi2S3 layers and reached a maximum at three Bi2S3 layers coated on top of the WO3 film, suggesting that three Bi2S3 layers is thick enough to establish an effective heterojunction for charge carrier separation and light absorption. It is worthwhile to note that three Bi2S3 layers coated on FTO glass also presents the highest photocurrent and IPCE compared with other numbers of Bi2S3 layers on FTO glass both in 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.2 M NaCl mixed water–ethanol solution (Fig. S10†). The exact film thickness could not be measured because the spherical Bi2S3 urchin shape particles resulted in an uneven film surface. The nominal thickness of the Bi2S3 layer was estimated to be approximately 3 μm. According to these results, we therefore conclude that three Bi2S3 layers coated on top of a WO3 film or FTO-glass substrate has optimal charge carrier separation efficiency and transport distance and thicker Bi2S3 films will move oxidation sites further away from the WO3–Bi2S3 interface and result in unwanted recombination due to the longer transport distance.

ConclusionsWe have demonstrated enhanced photoelectrochemical activity on Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction films by coupling WO3 nanoprism array films with urchin-like Bi2S3 nanospheres. The WO3 nanoprism arrays consisting of nanoprisms with cross-sections of 50–150 nm and lengths of 2 μm, were synthesized using a solvothermal method by adjusting the volume ratio of water to ethanol to 3:3. Coating a single Bi2S3 layer on top of the WO3 film, the photocurrent on the resulting Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film reached 1.33 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 1.19 mA cm−2 in 0.2 M NaCl mixed water–ethanol solution at 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which was 40% and 32% higher than the photocurrent for a bare WO3 film under the same conditions, respectively. The optimal number of Bi2S3 layers for coupling with the WO3 film was found to be 3 layers, which has the highest photocurrent density and IPCE in both 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.2 M NaCl mixed water–ethanol solution. The Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film was not stable in Na2SO4 and suffered from photocorrosion of Bi2S3, but still showed higher longer term photocurrents in Na2SO4. However, the heterojunction film was stable in a NaCl mixed water–ethanol solution and a non-aqueous solution containing the iodide/triiodide redox couple and photoelectrochemical testing in these solutions confirmed that the majority of enhanced photocurrent for the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction went towards oxidation of electrolyte species. The material properties and experimental results demonstrated that the conduction band edge of WO3 was more positive than that of Bi2S3, and such band potential matching is advantageous for the separation of charge carriers. As a result, most of the enhanced photoelectrochemical activity was ascribed to the formation of a heterojunction between the Bi2S3 and the WO3, which improved the charge separation efficiency.AcknowledgementsThe authors gratefully acknowledge the Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the U.S. Department of Energy through Grant DE-FG02-09ER16119, and the Welch Foundation (Grant F-1436) for funding this work.
