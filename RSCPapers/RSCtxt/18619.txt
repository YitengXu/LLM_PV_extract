    , Accepted 2nd August 2019First published on 2nd August 2019AbstractThe electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR) in an aqueous medium has recently aroused great attention for the synthesis of NH3 under ambient conditions. However, this process generally suffers from a low NH3 production rate and often requires a noble-metal based electrocatalyst with some sophisticated nanosynthesis method. This work reports a new non-precious, self-supportive iron sulfide (FeSx) NRR electrocatalyst, synthesized by a simple H2S-plasma treatment on low-cost Fe foam. The H2S-plasma treatment sulfurizes the Fe surface to afford a self-supportive FeSx thin layer on the Fe foam (FeSx/Fe). The synthesized FeSx/Fe foam can be directly used as the electrode for the NRR, and it is demonstrated to show a remarkable NH3 production rate of 4.13 × 10−10 mol s−1 cm−2 and a high faradaic efficiency of 17.6%, significantly outperforming many other reported non-precious electrocatalysts. Further material characterization shows that the surface FeSx converts to the mackinawite FeS after the NRR; the mackinawite FeS is possibly the actual high-activity NRR electrocatalyst, and density functional theory calculation is further employed to elucidate the NRR mechanism. Given the high performance and low cost, we envision that the plasma-synthesized FeSx/Fe will be of great promise for the electrochemical NH3 synthesis under ambient conditions.
Introduction
Ammonia (NH3) is the largest chemical product in the world, with an annual production of 150 million metric tons globally.1 Currently, over 90% of the synthetic NH3 is produced by the industrial Haber–Bosch process using N2 and H2 gases over Fe-based catalysts at high temperature (400–500 °C) and high pressure (150–200 atm), which demands 1% of the world energy supply and generates a huge amount of CO2.2–4 In stark contrast, many natural plants and bacteria carry metalloenzyme nitrogenase which can activate the highly stable NN triple bond (941 kJ mol−1) and enable NH3 generation from N2 under ambient conditions.5 Inspired by this biological process, significant effects have been devoted to seeking synthesis methods for NH3 from N2 under mild conditions. Recently, the electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR) in an aqueous medium has aroused great attention for the ambient synthesis of NH3.6–12 This electrochemical approach directly utilizes abundant water as the hydrogen source, and it can be readily coupled with an intermittent renewable energy source, such as wind, solar, or marine, to support the needed electricity, therefore also allowing for the use in areas with limited transportation accessibility and unsuitable for building large chemical plants.4,6 Nevertheless, the activation of the NN bond under mild conditions is a significant challenge, not only because of its very high bond energy but also because of its lack of dipole moment,13 and therefore an electrocatalyst is extremely required for the NRR. Moreover, the NRR in an aqueous medium always faces a fierce competition from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), because of their close redox potentials, which therefore renders an even more severe challenge on the selectivity of the electrocatalyst toward the NRR.6,7,14,15
Very recently, electrocatalysts based on single-atom Ru16 and Au nanoparticles9 were reported to show high rates and faradaic efficiencies for NH3 production. However, the use of the noble metals of Ru and Au, along with the required sophisticated synthesis for single atoms and nanoparticles, could cause a serious cost issue for large-scale applications. Other electrocatalysts based on non-precious metal compounds (e.g. Fe2O3,17,18 Bi4V2O11,19 MoS2,20,21 Mo2C,22 and Fe3S4 (ref. 23)), black-P,24 and carbon materials15,25–28 were also intensively studied, but the reported NH3 production rates and faradaic efficiencies were still comparatively low. Therefore, there is still a great and urgent need to develop highly-efficient non-precious NRR electrocatalysts, desirably with a simple and cost-effective synthesis approach.
Herein, we report a new self-supportive iron sulfide (FeSx) NRR electrocatalyst, which was synthesized by a simple H2S-plasma treatment on low-cost Fe foam. Upon the H2S-plasma treatment, the surface of the Fe foam was sulfurized to afford a self-supportive thin layer of FeSx, which exhibited a remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward the NRR. Using the Fe foam supported FeSx (FeSx/Fe) directly as the working electrode, at −0.30 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the FeSx/Fe electrode exhibited a remarkable NH3 production rate of 4.13 × 10−10 mol s−1 cm−2 with a fairly high faradaic efficiency of 17.6%, and these numbers significantly outperformed those reported for other non-precious electrocatalysts. Notably, the active N2 fixation sites in biological nitrogenase are featured for the Fe–S clusters,29 and their resemblance with respect to the herein reported pure-inorganic FeSx catalyst certainly deserves additional attention, as it may provide significant insights on the mimicking of the natural N2 fixation process.
Experimental procedures
H2S plasma treatment of Fe foam (preparation of the FeSx/Fe foam)
The H2S plasma treatment was carried out in a home-built system consisting of a quartz tube inside a tubular furnace.30 Commercial Fe foam was cut into 1 cm × 2 cm sized pieces, and the sample pieces were placed at the center zone inside the quartz tube. The tube was heated to 160 °C during the plasma treatment. 50 sccm H2S (3% diluted in Ar) gas was continuously flowed through the tube, and the pressure inside the tube was maintained at 600 mTorr by vacuum pumping. The upstream part of the quartz tube was wrapped with copper coil, through which a radiofrequency (13.56 MHz) power of 60 W was supplied to generate the H2S plasma inside the upstream zone of the tube. The plasma power was supplied in a pulsed mode, to avoid overheating of the tube. Each plasma pulse was 15 s long, and the entire sulfurization process consisted of 200 H2S plasma pulses in total.
Preparation of the Fe2O3/Fe foam
The aforementioned commercial Fe foam was heated in air at 600 °C for 1 h to afford the Fe2O3 surface layer on Fe.
Material characterization
The surface morphology of the plasma-treated FeSx/Fe foam was examined by using a SEM (Zeiss, SUPRA55), which was equipped with an EDS (Oxford Instruments, X-maxN 20) for the elemental mapping analysis. The surface FeSx layer was examined by cross-sectional STEM (Jeol, JEM-3200F), XPS (Thermo Scientific, Escalab 250Xi), XRD (Bruker, D8 Advance), and Raman spectroscopy (Horiba, LabRAM HR800). For STEM measurements, the cross-sectional sample was prepared by using the focused ion beam (FIB) (FEI, Scios) technique to cut a thin lamella from the FeSx/Fe foam. To protect the surface FeSx layer, a 400 nm Pt film was first deposited on the FeSx/Fe before using the FIB to cut the sample. The HAADF-STEM images were taken with an electron acceleration voltage of 300 kV, and the elemental maps were obtained by EDS (Thermo Scientific, UltraDry). For XPS experiments, a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source was used, and the binding energy was referenced to Au 4f7/2 (83.96 eV). The high-resolution XPS spectra were acquired using a pass energy of 20 eV. For Raman experiments, the excitation wavelength was 532 nm.
Electrochemical NRR measurements
As schematically illustrated in Fig. 2a, the electrochemical NRR measurements were carried out in a two-compartment cell, where the two compartments were covered with lids and separated by a Nafion 211 membrane. Prior to the measurements, the Nafion membrane was pretreated by sequentially immersing in 5% H2O2 aqueous solution and ultrapure water (both at 80 °C) for 1 h each. The electrochemical data were collected on a CHI604E electrochemical workstation using a standard three-electrode configuration. Pt foil and Hg/HgO electrodes were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively, and 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. The reported potentials were all iR-compensated and converted to the RHE scale. The electrochemical polarization curves were obtained by the potentiostatic chronoamperometry method, where the applied potential was stepwise increased and held constant in each step for 120 s to allow the current to reach a steady state. To characterize the NRR activity, pure N2 gas (99.999%, 1 atm) was continuously bubbled into the electrolyte toward the working electrode, and before the measurement, 30 min of N2 bubbling was first conducted to saturate the electrolyte and the compartments. For the control experiments, pure Ar gas (99.999%, 1 atm) was used (instead of N2) for the bubbling, and all the other experimental procedures were the same as those for N2. The Ar control experiments were performed in parallel to the NRR experiments, in order to exclude any potential interference from the ambient atmosphere (e.g. trace ambient ammonia12). All the NRR experiments were performed for at least three times to confirm the data reproducibility.
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 schematically shows the straightforward plasma approach to obtain the FeSx electrocatalyst. A piece of commercial porous Fe foam was treated in H2S plasma at 160 °C for an accumulation time of 50 min, and a thin uniform layer of FeSx was formed on the Fe surface (i.e. FeSx/Fe). The temperature of the plasma treatment was particularly chosen so as to limit the sulfur diffusion in Fe and therefore limit the sulfurization within the top tens of nm. The photographs in Scheme 1 show that the entire piece of the Fe foam changed the color uniformly after the H2S plasma treatment, which indicates a full uniform coverage of the FeSx on Fe and implies that this plasma process could be readily scaled up. The microstructure of the obtained FeSx/Fe foam was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and a typical SEM image and the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) are shown in Fig. 1a and b. After the plasma treatment, the integrity of the mesoporous foam structure was well retained, and the surface FeSx layer was fairly uniform and smooth. The good mesoporosity and uniform surface conversion to FeSx were both important for electrocatalysis, because they can enable fast diffusion of reactive species, efficient penetration of electrolyte, and significantly enlarged surface area for the electrochemical reaction.

The surface FeSx layer was further examined by cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). To prepare the STEM sample, a protective platinum layer was first deposited on the FeSx/Fe. Fig. 1c shows the high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) STEM image of the FeSx layer on Fe, and Fig. 1d–g show the corresponding elemental distributions, as obtained by EDS mapping. These results show that a uniform ∼70 nm FeSx layer was formed on the Fe surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further used to analyze the composition of the FeSx layer. Fig. 1h shows the XPS survey spectrum, and Fig. 1i and j show the high-resolution spectra for the Fe 2p and S 2p core-level emissions. The Fe spectrum shows paired spin–orbit peaks at 707.3 (2p3/2) and 720.0 eV (2p1/2), and the S spectrum shows paired spin–orbit peaks at 162.5 (2p3/2) and 163.7 eV (2p1/2). These numbers of binding energies agree well with those for FeS2,30 suggesting that the surface FeSx was FeS2. Also, from the areal intensities of the Fe and S 2p peaks, the atomic ratio of S/Fe was determined to be 2.03 ± 0.03, which again suggests the formation of FeS2. The crystal structure of the formed FeS2 was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution TEM with fast Fourier transform (FFT) image analysis (Fig. S1†), and both the techniques showed that the formed FeS2 was a mixed pyrite- and marcasite-type FeS2, resembling the case of using the H2S plasma for the atomic layer deposition of FeS2.30 The mixed phase of FeS2 was further confirmed by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S12†), and in addition, no Raman signals for elemental S were observed.
The electrocatalytic NRR performance of FeSx was characterized in 0.1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte at room temperature (21 °C) using a two-compartment cell with a three-electrode configuration as schematically illustrated in Fig. 2a (inset). Each of the cell compartments was covered with a lid, in order to avoid any potential interference from the ambient atmosphere (e.g. trace ambient ammonia31). The FeSx/Fe foam was directly used as the working electrode. To characterize the NRR performance, pure N2 gas (99.999%, 1 atm) was continuously bubbled into the electrolyte, and an additional 30 min of N2 bubbling was conducted prior to the measurement. For the control experiments, pure Ar gas (99.999%, 1 atm) was instead used for the bubbling. More experimental details are provided in the ESI.† The electrochemical polarization curves were obtained by stepwise increasing the potential from −0.14 to −0.42 V (vs. RHE) and holding the potential constant for 120 s in each step to allow the current to reach a steady state (Fig. S2†). The values of the steady-state currents were used to generate the polarization curves as shown in Fig. 2a for the measurements taken under N2 or Ar gas bubbling. The current density (j) was found to be considerably greater under N2 bubbling (jN2) than that under Ar bubbling (jAr), especially in the potential range from −0.22 to −0.38 V (vs. RHE). Presumably, the current under Ar bubbling should correspond to the HER, and assuming that the HER and NRR are two separate competing processes, the difference between the above two curves (Δj = jN2 − jAr) should correspond to the NRR. Our results showed that this difference of current density (Δj) reached its maximum of −138 μA cm−2 at −0.30 V (vs. RHE), and this number accounted for as high as 19.7% of the total current density under N2 bubbling (jN2). The high Δj/jN2 ratio implied that a fairly large portion of the cathodic current was used to reduce N2.

The reduction products of N2 (e.g. NH3 and N2H4) were quantified by the following procedures. To obtain sufficient amounts of the products for quantitative assessment, we first biased the FeSx electrode at a certain constant potential for 20 h, and then collected the electrolyte on the FeSx electrode side to analyze the quantities of the accumulated products. This procedure was repeatedly conducted at various constant potentials of −0.14, −0.22, −0.30, −0.38, and −0.42 V (vs. RHE), and the trace of the current density variation over each 20 h period was also recorded for each potential. As shown in Fig. 2b, the current densities remained fairly constant over time, suggesting a good stability of the electrocatalyst. The negligible variation of the current density also suggests a constant generation rate of the reaction product, and therefore the product generation rate could be calculated by dividing the total product amount by the total reaction time. As the major product of the NRR, the amount of NH3 was quantified by the ion chromatography, indophenol blue, and Nessler's reagent methods. As shown in the following, all the three methods gave out quite similar results, owing to the reasonably high concentration of NH3 in the post-NRR electrolyte (up to ∼2 mM), which was significantly higher than the detection limits of these methods.31Fig. 2c shows the ion chromatograms of the post-NRR electrolytes, and using the absolute calibration curve shown in Fig. S3,† the concentration of NH3 in the reaction product solution could be obtained. Similarly, for the indophenol blue and Nessler's reagent methods, the photographs and absorption spectra are shown in Fig. S4 and S5,† and the calibration curves are shown in Fig. S6.† The obtained concentrations of NH3 were used to calculate the production rates of NH3 at various potentials on the FeSx electrocatalyst. As shown in Table S1,† the numbers obtained from the three methods were quite similar, and therefore we simply used the numbers from the ion chromatography to plot Fig. 2d and e. A control experiment was carried out in parallel, using the same setup but instead using Ar for the bubbling for 20 h (potential = 0 V vs. RHE). The resultant electrolyte was also analyzed for NH3 using the same methods as above, and the obtained curves are included in Fig. 2c, S4, and S5† for comparison. Clearly, the NH3 production from the control experiment was negligible, which confirmed that the previously obtained NH3 production was exclusively from the electrochemical NRR process. Fig. 2d plots the NH3 production rate with respect to the applied potential (see also Table S2†), and a maximum rate of 4.45 × 10−10 mol s−1 cm−2 was observed at −0.30 V (vs. RHE). The faradaic efficiency (FE) of NH3 production was also calculated (Fig. 2e), and its maximum number was able to reach 18.9% at −0.30 V (vs. RHE). Both of these numbers were fairly high, and they were among the best values reported recently (Table S3†).15,32 To confirm the high performance of NH3 production, we adopted a recently published protocol of using isotopic 15N labelling.33 With the use of the 15N2 gas (99% isotopic purity) as the nitrogen source, the NRR experiment was performed again at −0.30 V (vs. RHE), and the production of the 15N-labelled ammonia (i.e.15NH3) was quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).33 More experimental details are provided in the ESI.† The obtained results (Fig. S8†) show that at −0.30 V (vs. RHE) the 15NH3 production rate and faradaic efficiency were 4.13 × 10−10 mol s−1 cm−2 and 17.6%, respectively. These numbers (included in Fig. 2d and e) are quite close to those previously obtained by ion chromatography, indophenol blue, and Nessler's reagent methods, which therefore confirms the high performance of the NH3 production by our FeSx catalyst. Given that the 15N labelling results are more convincing, we report these numbers for our catalyst in the following (Fig. 2f) and to benchmark with other reports (Table S3†). Besides, in Fig. 2e the Δj/jN2 ratio is also plotted for comparison, and the Δj/jN2 ratio was found to be only slightly higher (0.3–1.7%) than the FE of NH3, suggesting a high selectivity of NH3 over other reduction products. In fact, we also quantified the production of N2H4 using the Watt–Chrisp spectrophotometric method (Fig. S6 and S7†), and found out that N2H4 was the major byproduct to account for the minor discrepancy shown in Fig. 2e (see also Table S2†). To sum up, the plasma-prepared FeSx showed very good electrocatalytic performance toward the production of NH3 from N2 under ambient conditions, with a high NH3 production rate, high faradaic efficiency, and excellent stability.
To gain insights on the electrocatalytic mechanism, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out on the FeSx/Fe electrode in Ar- and N2-saturated solutions. Fig. 3a and b respectively show the Nyquist and Bode plots for the EIS data measured at −0.30 V (vs. RHE). The Nyquist plot shows single semicircles for both the cases, and the semicircle diameter was smaller for the N2-saturated case than that for the Ar-saturated case; the Bode plot shows single peaks in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz, and the peak frequency was larger for the N2-saturated case than that for the Ar-saturated case. Similar measurements were also taken for other potentials and the results exhibited the same trend (Fig. S9†). The single Nyquist semicircle and Bode peak refer to a single equivalent charge-transfer process in the assessed frequency range (0.1 Hz to 10 kHz), which therefore suggests that the electrochemical HER and NRR herein were comparable in their reaction rates34–36 and they might be viewed as two parallel processes. Therefore, the EIS data taken in the N2-saturated solution were fitted using a slightly modified equivalent circuit as shown in the Fig. 3c inset, where the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) was separated into RHER and RNRR to account for the two reaction channels in parallel, and the values of RHER were simply adopted from the fittings of the EIS data measured in the Ar-saturated solution where no NRR occurred. Details of the fitting results are listed in Table S4.† We further calculated the value of RNRR−1/(RNRR−1 + RHER−1) at each potential, which corresponds to the percentage of the NRR current. As shown in Fig. 3c, the data of RNRR−1/(RNRR−1 + RHER−1) exhibited the same trend as that of the Δj/jN2 ratios (Fig. 2e), which indicates a good agreement between the ac and dc measurements.

We further conducted the material characterization of the surface FeSx after the NRR. Although the mesoscopic surface morphology of the FeSx/Fe electrode remained almost the same after the NRR (Fig. S10†), considerable differences were found in the XPS results as shown in Fig. 4a and b. Based on the areal intensities of the XPS peaks, the S/Fe atomic ratio was found to be much reduced to 0.94 ± 0.04 after the NRR, suggesting a 1:1 stoichiometry for the post-NRR FeSx (i.e. x ≈ 1); the peak positions also shifted to 706.9 (2p3/2) and 720.3 eV (2p1/2) for Fe 2p and 161.8 (2p3/2) and 162.7 eV (2p1/2) for S 2p, and these binding energy values match well with those for mackinawite FeS.37,38 Raman measurement was further taken, and as shown in Fig. 4c the results clearly indicate a phase transition to the mackinawite FeS after the NRR (see also Fig. S12†). The formation of the mackinawite FeS was also evidenced in XRD and high-resolution TEM results (Fig. S11†). The transition from FeS2 to FeS was probably accompanied by the leaching of S and Fe (S leached more) into the electrolyte solution, because the FeSx surface layer became appreciably thinner (∼10 nm) after the NRR (Fig. S11†). It is worth noting that apparently the surface of the post-NRR FeSx was partially oxidized as observed by XPS (Fig. 4a and S13†), however it is currently not sure whether the oxidation occurred during the NRR or during the air break just before the XPS measurement, because the mackinawite FeS itself can be readily oxidized upon air exposure.38 Some future studies on in situ characterization are needed to clarify this issue. Nevertheless, the mackinawite FeS is for sure of critical importance for the NRR, because the iron oxide itself was not able to afford such a high performance (vide infra, Fig. 2f). To further show the critical importance of the mackinawite FeS, we employed a vapour-phase atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique37,38 to directly deposit a thin layer (∼13 nm) of mackinawite FeS on the Fe foam. As shown in Fig. S14,† the NRR performance of the ALD FeS was almost identical to that of the above plasma-synthesized FeSx. Therefore, we speculate that the mackinawite FeS was possibly the actual electrocatalyst for the NRR.

(d) Free-energy diagram for the NRR on the mackinawite FeS(011) surface, obtained from the DFT calculation (U = 0 V). (e) Charge density difference of the N2-adsorbed surface; the red and green isosurfaces (0.002 e Å−3) denote electron accumulation and depletion in the space, respectively. 
To further elucidate the NRR mechanism, theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculation was carried out. In light of the above characterization and discussion, the DFT calculation was performed on the mackinawite FeS(011) surface, which exposes the electrocatalytic centers of the transition-metal Fe atoms. Fig. 4d displays the calculated free energy diagram of the lowest energy pathway for the NRR, and the corresponding elementary reaction steps are illustrated in Fig. S15.† The NRR process prefers an alternating protonation pathway,39,40 and the potential-determining step is suggested to be the first protonation step of the adsorbed N2 molecule (ΔG = 0.46 eV). Interestingly, for this protonation step, the thermodynamically favored configuration of the adsorbed dinitrogen moiety changes from an end-on configuration (*NN), coordinating to one surface Fe atom, to a bridged configuration (*NNH*), where the two N atoms are coordinated to two neighbouring Fe atoms on the surface. This observation suggests that the protonation may go through an intermediate step, where the adsorbed end-on N2 first lies down on the surface, forming a bridged *NN* configuration and then being protonated. This process is realizable (ΔG = 0.22 eV) probably because of the well-suited Fe–Fe distance on the surface of the mackinawite FeS host structure.
The charge density differences for the two N2-adsorbed configurations (*NN and *NN*) were further calculated to uncover the electron transfer behaviors between the N2 and Fe atoms. As shown in Fig. 4e, for the end-on *NN configuration, the lone-pair electrons on N2 are donated to the Fe cation (σ donation) forming a weak Fe–N bond, while some Fe d-orbital electrons are donated back into the N2 π* antibonding orbital (π back-donation), weakening the NN triple bond, and as a result, the N2 bond length is appreciably increased to 1.140 Å in the *NN configuration, as compared to 1.0976 Å in free N2. As for the bridged *NN* configuration, the π back-donation is considerably enhanced, because of the spatial match of the electron orbitals in the bridged Fe–N–N–Fe configuration. The insensitive π back-donation significantly weakens the NN triple bond and strengthens the Fe–N bonds (Fig. 4e), and as a result, the N2 bond length is significantly increased to 1.190 Å, approaching the bond length of the NN double bond in diazene (1.201 Å).41,42 Apparently, the N2 bond is highly activated in the bridged *NN* configuration, and this high activation benefits from the well-suited Fe–Fe distance on the mackinawite FeS surface, which therefore highlights the importance of the mackinawite-structure FeS electrocatalyst for the NRR.
Lastly, we also compared the NRR performance of FeSx with Fe2O3, which was recently reported as a good NRR electrocatalyst.17,18 The Fe2O3 catalyst was prepared by surface oxidation of the same-type Fe foam (Fe2O3/Fe), and thus the surface areas of the FeSx/Fe and Fe2O3/Fe electrodes were approximately the same (Fig. S16†). Using the same measurement procedure, the resultant maximum N2 production rate and faradaic efficiency of the Fe2O3 electrocatalyst were obtained and are plotted in Fig. 2f. Note that the bare Fe foam did not show any measurable NH3 production. Indeed, the Fe2O3 catalyst showed a decent NH3 production rate of 2.71 × 10−11 mol s−1 cm−2 (at −0.3 V vs. RHE) with a faradaic efficiency of 2.2%, which were both consistent with previous reports;18,43 however these numbers were apparently much lower than those of the FeSx electrocatalyst.
Conclusions
In summary, we reported a simple, cost-effective plasma sulfurization method to prepare self-supportive FeSx on Fe foam for the efficient NRR under ambient conditions. The prepared FeSx/Fe electrode was demonstrated to show a remarkable NH3 production rate of 4.13 × 10−10 mol s−1 cm−2 and a high faradaic efficiency of 17.6%, significantly outperforming many other non-precious electrocatalysts. Further material characterization showed that the surface FeSx converted to the mackinawite FeS after the NRR, and the mackinawite FeS was possibly the actual high-activity NRR electrocatalyst. DFT calculation was further employed to elucidate the NRR mechanism on FeS, and the well-suited Fe–Fe distance on the mackinawite FeS(011) surface was suggested to be the crucial factor for the high NRR activity. Given the high performance and low cost, we envision that the plasma-synthesized FeSx/Fe will be of high promise for the electrochemical NH3 synthesis under ambient conditions. In addition, the structure of the FeS catalyst resembles, to some extent, the Fe–S clusters in biological nitrogenase, which may provide important insights on the mimicking of the natural N2 fixation process.
