    , Accepted 30th October 2021First published on 1st November 2021AbstractPassivating defects on the surface and at the grain boundaries of perovskite films has been recognized as a rational approach to improve the performances of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, less attention has been paid to the subsurface region in which defect states are also spread, and there is lack of strategies available for the passivation of subsurface defects. Here, by regulating the amount of PbI2 on the surface of the MAPbI3 film, we constructed a gradient-type 2D/3D perovskite structure in which the 2D perovskite transition layer forms in the subsurface region of the 3D perovskite film, quite different from the widely studied bilayered 2D/3D perovskite structure. Compared to the latter, which mainly passivates the surface defects, the gradient-type 2D/3D structure can heal both the surface and subsurface defects, more efficiently suppressing the charge recombination. Moreover, only small n value (such as n = 1–3) 2D perovskites are found in the bilayered 2D/3D film, but larger n value 2D species are also revealed in the gradient-type film, leading to a gradient energy-level alignment that can promote the hole transport/extraction. Thus, the gradient-type 2D/3D structure performs better in PSCs than its bilayered counterpart, demonstrating the significance of the subsurface defect passivation and the energy-level gradient for the performance of PSCs.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted unprecedented interest because of their strong light absorption, high and balanced charge mobility, long electron–hole diffusion and the low charge recombination of the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials.1–5 However, the polycrystalline perovskite films prepared using the solution deposition method suffer from a high number of defects residing on the surface and at the grain boundaries, which induce the nonradiative recombination of photo-excited charge carriers and thus modest device performances. A number of passivation agents have been consequently reported to mitigate such defects, improving the device efficiency and stability.6–10
In addition to the surface and grain boundaries, the subsurface region from the top surface to the interior of the film, with a depth of dozens of nanometers, is composed of disconnected nanocrystals and amorphous phases, which results in more defects occurring in the subsurface region than in the bulk.11,12 Therefore, optimizing the subsurface is essential to enhancing the device performance, which has been less studied to date. Recently, a facile mechanical approach using adhesive tapes was reported in which the defective subsurface layer was peeled off.13 Vacuum-assisted surface recrystallization and femtosecond laser polishing have also been demonstrated to ameliorate the subsurface of perovskite films.14,15 These methods can reduce the nonradiative charge recombination loss and improve the performance of PSCs, however, subsurface engineering strategies are still rare, and have never been realized using a simple solution-processing technique.
As one of the effective passivating agents, 2D perovskites have been widely used to form an additional layer to passivate the surface defects and protect the 3D perovskite film against moisture, leading to increased device efficiency and stability.16–18 In these previously reported works, the 2D perovskite layer is grown in situ on the surface of a 3D perovskite film containing residual PbI2 that is charged using over-stoichiometry during the preparation of the precursor solution.19,20 In this way, the 2D perovskite layer in the formed 2D/3D bilayered structure can only modify the 3D perovskite surface, but cannot optimize the subsurface region of the 3D perovskite film. However, the subsurface 3D perovskite could also be converted into a 2D layered perovskite structure. Chen et al. proposed a vapor-assisted growth strategy to transform the subsurface 3D perovskites into 2D structures upon exposure to butylamine vapor (BAV).21 Xu et al. demonstrated the feasibility of a 3D–2D planar heterojunction through a slight solvent-assisted interfacial reaction with a high-concentration of n-butylammonium iodide (BAI) in tert-butanol solution.22 However, thus far, less attention has been paid to the functionalization of the subsurface using the 3D-to-2D phase transformation realized by incorporating organic ammonium molecules onto the 3D perovskite film surface, in which there is no or few residual PbI2 molecules, and the effect of the transformed 2D perovskite layer on subsurface defects and charge recombination has not been clearly elucidated. In particular, it would be beneficial to study the two classes of 2D/3D structures, derived from the subsurface transformation and from the in situ growth of surficial excess PbI2, respectively, using a comparative research platform to identify which is superior.
In this work, we constructed 2D/3D perovskite structures using two strategies by regulating the amount of PbI2 on the MAPbI3 perovskite surface and compared their effects on the passivation of subsurface defects, the charge transport/extraction, and the device performance. If an over-stoichiometric PbI2/MAI (1.05:1 in mole) was adopted, a 3D perovskite film (OS-3D) with excess PbI2 on the surface was obtained, as widely reported in the previously published literature.20 After treating it with organic ammonium iodide (2-thiophenemethylammonium iodide, ThMAI), a bilayered 2D/3D perovskite structure (OS-2D/3D) was formed. In contrast, in the case of stoichiometric PbI2/MAI (1:1 in mole), very few PbI2 molecules were observed on the surface of the prepared 3D perovskite film (S-3D), and a gradient-type 2D/3D perovskite structure (S-2D/3D) was achieved after treatment of the ThMAI (illustrated in Fig. 1a). The 2D perovskite layer in S-2D/3D exhibited both surface and subsurface defect healing effects, while the one in OS-2D/3D could only passivate the surface defects. More interestingly, in the OS-2D/3D only small n value (such as n = 1, 2, and 3) 2D perovskites were found, but large n value 2D perovskites were also formed in the S-2D/3D case in addition to the small ones. The presence of both large and small n value 2D perovskites in the S-2D/3D provides a more appropriate energy alignment at the perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interface than that in the OS-2D/3D. The reduced trap density and proper energy alignment promoted the hole transport from the 3D perovskite to the HTL, suppressing the charge recombination and improving the hole extraction. Consequently, the resultant S-2D/3D PSC afforded a superior efficiency of 20.58%, which outperforms the OS-2D/3D PSC.

Results and discussion
The S-3D and OS-3D perovskite films were prepared using a one-step anti-solvent assisted deposition method. The ThMAI has been used to develop 2D perovskites for PSCs with high performance values.23 Meanwhile, the incorporation of ThMA+ as a spacer cation into the 3D perovskite can effectively induce the crystalline orientation and passivate the trap states.24 Here, we fabricated S-2D/3D and OS-2D/3D perovskites by spin-coating a ThMAI solution dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) upon the S-3D and OS-3D perovskite films with different amounts of PbI2 on the surface (detailed information is shown in the ESI†), as illustrated in Fig. 1a. To confirm the formation of 2D perovskites in the two cases, we performed X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and UV-vis absorption measurements. Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of the different samples, all of which present typical peaks for the crystalline MAPbI3 film. For the OS-3D film, there is a pronounced peak at 12.7° implying the presence of excess PbI2, while for the S-3D one, no PbI2 signal is observed. In the XRD pattern of the OS-2D/3D film, the PbI2 peak disappears, indicating that the PbI2 on the surface of the 3D perovskite has reacted with ThMA+ to form the 2D perovskite. Meanwhile, new peaks emerge at 6.1° and 12.2° corresponding to the (020) and (080) crystallographic planes of the 2D layered perovskite (ThMA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1.23 The same signals are seen for the S-2D/3D sample as well, suggesting the presence of the 2D perovskites in this case. Fig. 1c shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the 3D and 2D/3D perovskite films, in which the absorption edge is located at 780 nm, typically belonging to the 3D MAPbI3 perovskite. However, the excitonic absorption peaks of the 2D perovskite species can be observed at 525 nm (n = 1), 575 nm (n = 2) and 622 nm (n = 3) for both the S-2D/3D and OS-2D/3D films. These peaks could be indexed to a single-phase (ThMA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskite with different small n values.23 Furthermore, the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum was used to confirm the ThMA+ cation of the 2D perovskites (Fig. S1†). An extra peak at 1567 cm−1 is observed for the 2D/3D samples, which can be assigned to the aromatic CC stretching vibration from the ThMA+, suggesting its presence as a spacer cation in the formed 2D perovskites.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was conducted to investigate the distinction between the S-2D/3D and OS-2D/3D structures. Meanwhile, the morphological information and cross-sectional images of the OS-3D, S-3D, OS-2D/3D and S-2D/3D samples were also obtained. The OS-3D film is rough and some excess PbI2 can be observed on the surface of the film (Fig. 2a). After the ThMAI treatment, the excess PbI2 on the OS-3D film disappears, and the new morphology can be seen, attributed to the formed 2D perovskites (Fig. 2b), as widely reported in the previously published literature.20–22 In the case of the S-3D film, the surface is compact and no PbI2 is present (Fig. 2c), while a clear surface morphology change was observed after the ThMAI treatment (Fig. 2d). This surface morphology is obviously different from that observed for the OS-2D/3D in which the 2D perovskite is an additional layer. Furthermore, the cross-sectional SEM images show that a bilayered structure is formed for the OS-2D/3D in which the 2D perovskite resides on the surface of the bulk 3D perovskite (Fig. 2e and f). In contrast, a transition layer is observed in the subsurface region without a clear boundary with the 3D perovskite in the S-2D/3D structure (Fig. 2g and h). This transition layer is most likely formed via the diffusion of the ThMAI molecules into the subsurface region through the surface and grain boundaries,22,25 consequently leading to a 3D-to-2D phase transition close to the 3D perovskite surface. In this way, the 2D perovskite moiety in this kind of 2D/3D structure will be distributed throughout the surface and subsurface regions. In order to elucidate this, photoluminescence (PL) imaging analysis using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was conducted for the OS-3D, S-3D, OS-2D/3D and S-2D/3D perovskite surfaces by monitoring the emission wavelengths at 500–550 nm (green color, belonging to the PbI2 or 2D perovskite, n = 1) and 740–800 nm (red color, belonging to the 3D perovskite). For the two 3D cases, only the red fluorescence from the 3D perovskite can be observed and the PL of PbI2 cannot be monitored owing to the extremely low emission (Fig. S2†). As shown in Fig. 2i and j, the green fluorescence of the OS-2D/3D sample, which is also indicative of the presence of layered 2D perovskites,26 is much stronger than that of the S-2D/3D one; and vice versa for the red fluorescence. This result suggests that the 2D (n = 1) perovskite species in the S-2D/3D structure are only partially present on the surface, whilst others may exist in the subsurface region compared to the OS-2D/3D sample. Actually, we also tried to measure the PL imaging with a longer wavelength from 550 to 650 nm (n = 2, 3), but the signal cannot be detected, probably owing to the relatively weak PL and their absence on the surface of the film.

The effect of two classes of 2D/3D structures on the defect passivation was examined using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) and time-resolved PL (TrPL) measurements. Fig. 2m and n displays the dark current–voltage curves measured for the electron-only and hole-only devices. All the 3D and 2D/3D films show almost the same electron trap density (Fig. 2m) owing to the identical bottom surface properties of the 3D perovskite layer, but a variable hole trap density. The corresponding trap densities were estimated to be 8.14, 8.09, 6.87 and 6.99 × 1014 cm−3 for the S-3D, OS-3D, S-2D/3D and OS-2D/3D films, respectively (Table S1†). It can be seen that the 2D/3D perovskite films exhibit a lower trap density than the 3D ones, and furthermore the S-2D/3D film presents a reduced trap density relative to the OS-2D/3D one. This is likely due to the conversion of the subsurface 3D perovskites into the 2D counterparts in the S-2D/3D structure as mentioned previously, which could passivate both the surface and subsurface defects; in contrast, the OS-2D/3D structure only has a surface defect healing effect. Moreover, the TrPL spectra (Fig. 2o) shows that the average decay lifetimes (Table S2†) of the S-3D and OS-3D films are 149.6 and 164.53 ns, which is prolonged to 212.3 ns for the S-2D/3D film and 190.6 ns for the OS-2D/3D film, respectively. These results also indicate the more efficient defect passivation in the S-2D/3D film, ascribed to the additional subsurface defect healing that is absent in the OS-2D/3D one.
The spatial location and passivation effect of the 2D perovskite in the two classes of 2D/3D structures have been elucidated; however, the compositional distribution of the 2D perovskites in the two cases is still unclear. The results of the XRD and UV-visible absorption analyses confirm the formation of 2D perovskites with small n values as discussed above but cannot distinguish between the large n value components in the 2D/3D films. Normally, only small n value 2D perovskites are achieved in the OS-2D/3D structure, as previously reported in the literature.20 The composition of the 2D perovskite in the S-2D/3D case has rarely been investigated previously. To this end, the PL spectra excited from both the back (substrate quartz) and front (perovskite surface) sides of the films (Fig. 3a and b) were monitored. By illuminating the S-3D film from both the back and front sides, there is only one PL peak at 780 nm, this is the characteristic emission for the 3D perovskite. For the OS-3D film, this peak also appears upon illuminating from the back and front sides, however, an additional weak emission band at 530 nm is observed when exciting the film from the front side. The additional peak corresponds to the excess PbI2 on the 3D perovskite surface, which is in good agreement with the preceding results. For the S-2D/3D and OS-2D/3D films, we can only observe the 3D MAPbI3 peak at 780 nm from the back side illumination. Upon exciting from the front side, both samples exhibit three evident and gradually weakened peaks at 525, 575, and 622 nm, which stem from the emissions of the small n value 2D perovskites. Very interestingly, while the OS-2D/3D film still displays the 3D perovskite fluorescence peaking at 780 nm, the S-2D/3D one presents a blue-shifted emission band at 765 nm, which is an indicator of the superposition of both large n 2D perovskite species and the 3D perovskite.22 Therefore, these results verify the mixture of both large and small n value 2D perovskites in the S-2D/3D film, and only small n value analogs exist in the OS-2D/3D film. In addition, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to detect the surface energy band structure for the S-3D, OS-3D, S-2D/3D and OS-2D/3D perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 3c. The obtained valence band maximum (VBM) values for the S-2D/3D and OS-2D/3D films are −5.57 and −5.61 eV, respectively, which are close to that of the (ThMA)PbI4 (n = 1) 2D perovskite (−5.55 eV, Fig. S3†). The slight difference in the VBM means that the 2D components on the film surface of these two structures are quite similar, which indicates that the small n value 2D perovskites are present on the surface while the large n value ones are located inside the subsurface of the S-2D/3D film. The discriminating PL and UPS results reveal that the n value of the 2D perovskites will decrease gradually from the subsurface region to the top surface for the S-2D/3D film, forming a better graded band structure than that of the OS-2D/3D film, as illustrated by the energy level diagram of the S-2D/3D and OS-2D/3D structures in Fig. 3d and e. Thus, a more efficient hole transport pathway is established for the S-2D/3D structure, and the effect of the gradient distributions of different n value 2D perovskite components on the hole transport/extraction at the perovskite/HTL interface was investigated using the TrPL measurement for the 3D and 2D/3D films covered by the HTL. As shown in Fig. 3f and Table S2,† the average decay lifetimes of the 3D samples are less than that of the 2D/3D ones. Furthermore, the lifetime of the S-2D/3D sample (22.03 ns) is less than that of the OS-2D/3D one (22.95 ns). These results clearly verify that the S-2D/3D structure induces the gradient energy level alignment, assisting efficient hole transport and extraction, which is expected to reduce the nonradiative recombination.27,28 To further confirm the better charge transport properties in the S-2D/3D structure, we also carried out SCLC measurements with configurations of the electron-only and hole-only devices (Fig. 3g and h). Although a similar electron transport capability is observed for all the 3D and 2D/3D films (Fig. 3g), the hole transport property is different. As shown in Fig. 3h, the slightly higher current for the S-2D/3D device means that this structure presents better hole transportation than the OS-2D/3D one. This is further demonstrated by the photocurrent-voltage measurements for the PSCs devices with the none-HTL configuration of the ITO/SnO2 (ETL)/perovskite layer/Au (Fig. S4†), and the detailed performance metrics can be found in Table S3.† Significantly, the S-2D/3D device shows a better performance than the OS-2D/3D one, owing to the enhanced hole transportation. From these results, we believe that the presence of large n value 2D perovskites in the subsurface region of the S-2D/3D facilitates the formation of the graded band structure that can drive holes moving faster and more effectively towards the HTL in contrast to the situation observed for the OS-2D/3D.

To evaluate the effect of the two different 2D/3D structures on the photovoltaic performances, we subsequently employed the 3D and 2D/3D perovskite films to fabricate PSCs with the device configuration of the ITO/SnO2/perovskite layer/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Their current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 4a. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the PSCs and the corresponding integrated JSC were characterized to verify the increasing trend of JSC, as shown in Fig. 4b. The trend for the integrated JSC from the EQE matches very well with that of the JSC from the J–V curves. The statistical photovoltaic performances of the different samples are summarized in Fig. 4c–f and the performance parameters for the best PSCs are listed in Table 1. Furthermore, the stabilized JSC and PCE of the S-3D, S-2D/3D, OS-3D and OS-2D/3D PSCs were also measured at a fixed maximum power point (MPP) voltage over 120 s under continuous one-sun illumination (Fig. S5†). The JSC is stabilized at 20.62 mA cm−2 for the S-2D/3D PSC and 20.55 mA cm−2 for the OS-2D/3D one, corresponding to a stable PCE within the testing period. However, the two 3D PSCs exhibit an apparent decay in the JSC and PCE during this short testing time. The J–V hysteresis effect of the PSCs was also examined, with a smaller hysteresis for the 2D/3D PSCs than that for the 3D ones (Fig. S6†). The photovoltaic analyses ascertain that the 2D perovskites in both cases can enhance the device efficiencies, and in particular the S-2D/3D PSCs show better performances than the OS-2D/3D ones, owing to the suppressed nonradiative charge recombination and superior hole transport pathway, as evidenced above.29,30

To gain insights into the nonradiative charge recombination in the PSCs, the charge recombination process was analyzed using light intensity-dependent JSC and VOC plotted in double logarithmic scales. The exponent α values of the light intensity-dependent JSC for all PSCs are close to 1 (Fig. 5a, the α value was obtained according to the expression: J ∝ Iα),29 indicating that the recombination is dominated by the monomolecular mechanism under short–circuit conditions for all devices. Fig. 5b displays the light-intensity dependent VOC for all PSCs. The slope value of the S-2D/3D PSCs is slightly reduced compared to that of the OS-2D/3D PSCs, which means that the trap-assisted recombination is lower for the former. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out to better investigate the charge recombination dynamics of these PSCs. Fig. 5c presents their Nyquist plots, and the fitted values are tabulated in Table S4.† The span of the first arc, corresponding to the high frequency feature, is ascribed to the charge transfer and transportation resistance (Rct) associated with the perovskite/HTL interface. The span of the second arc, corresponding to the lower frequency element, reflects the resistance of charge recombination (Rrec), and the charge recombination rate is inversely proportional to the Rrec.20,31 The S-2D/3D devices present a lower Rct and higher Rrec than those of the OS-2D/3D ones, resulting from the superior hole transport pathway and subsurface defect healing, which suppresses the nonradiative charge recombination at the perovskite/HTL interface, thus leading to a higher VOC and FF for the S-2D/3D PSCs. The charge recombination and collection processes are competing in the PSCs, which are controlled by the effective internal electric field.30 Thus, to estimate the charge collection efficiency (ηcc) under operational conditions,32 the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) of the 3D and 2D/3D PSCs were double logarithmic plotted in Fig. 5d and the calculated ηcc probability of all devices is summarized in Table S5.† The ηcc probability of S-2D/3D PSCs is always higher than that of the OS-2D/3D ones, owing to the enhancement of hole transport and the suppression of charge recombination.

The VOC of the S-2D/3D PSCs is higher than that of the OS-2D/3D ones, because the gradient-type structure can trigger a more effective potential in the subsurface region, and reinforce the built-in potential (Vbi) of devices.33 Thus, Mott–Schottky measurements were carried out to compare the Vbi of the PSCs, and the extended C–V curves are represented in Fig. 5e.34 It is clear that the extracted Vbi of the 2D/3D devices is higher than that of the 3D ones. More importantly, the Vbi of the S-2D/3D PSCs is larger than that of the OS-2D/3D PSCs, which is expected to deliver better charge transport. Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) was employed to study the charge transport properties of the complete devices, and the resulting frequency dependent impedance current is analyzed in Fig. 5f. The time constant τIMPS can be obtained from the inverse of the minimum angular frequency (ωmin):35τIMPS = 1/ωmin. The obtained τIMPS (Table S6†) for the S-2D/3D PSCs is lower than that of the OS-2D/3D PSCs, which indicates that the charge can be extracted faster by the electrode in the former. According to the above described results, the S-2D/3D PSC has a lower trap density and better charge transportation than those of the OS-2D/3D PSC, leading to suppressed charge recombination and thus better device performances. Furthermore, the results of the device simulation obtained using one-dimensional solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS) calculations36–39 also show that the superior device performance of the S-2D/3D PSC is attributed to the lower trap density and better charge transport (Fig. S7†), and the details can be found in the ESI.†
Finally, we also examined the stability performance of the unencapsulated PSCs stored in ambient air and at 85 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6, the 2D/3D devices retain 85% of the initial PCE in air for 1000 h and 70% after aging at 85 °C for 1400 h, outperforming their counterparts based on the 3D films. Meanwhile, the tests under a relative humidity of 65 ± 5% and constant light illumination also indicate the better stability of the 2D/3D devices, as shown in Fig. S8.† Hence, it is clear that the 2D/3D PSCs possess an excellent long-term stability, which can be ascribed to their immunity to oxygen and moisture. In addition, the stability of the S-2D/3D and OS-2D/3D PSCs displays a negligible difference, which is further certified by the surface contact angles for water of the perovskite films (Fig. S9†). Therefore, both the 2D/3D perovskite structures can effectively protect the perovskite from destruction resulting from external stresses.

Conclusions
We have constructed two different 2D/3D perovskite structures by regulating the amount of PbI2 on the MAPbI3 film surface, and investigated their effects on defect passivation, charge transport/extraction, and the performance of the devices. The gradient-type S-2D/3D structure and bilayered OS-2D/3D structure were achieved after ThMAI treatment on the S-3D and OS-3D films, respectively. The S-2D/3D structure can reduce both the surface and subsurface defects, while the OS-2D/3D one can only passivate the surface defects. In addition, the OS-2D/3D perovskite film only contains small n value 2D perovskites, but the S-2D/3D film shows both large and small n value 2D components that can provide a gradient energy-level alignment at the perovskite/HTL interface. Thus, the S-2D/3D PSCs possess reduced trap defects and a more appropriate energy-level alignment, substantially improving the hole transport and suppressing the charge recombination, both of which result in superior device performances to those of the OS-2D/3D PSCs. This work provides a novel strategy for the passivation of subsurface defects to ameliorate the performance of PSCs.
