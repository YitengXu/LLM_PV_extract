    , Accepted 9th April 2019First published on 9th April 2019AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have realized a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.7%. However, defects and a high moisture sensitivity limit the further development of perovskite device performance. This study shows that cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), a multifunctional ammonium salt, plays dual roles in passivating the perovskite defects and improving the moisture stability. Attaching a long carbon chain to the perovskite surface improves the humidity stability. The ammonium group in the CTA+ cation can anchor to the surface of the MAPbI3 film to passivate defects without the formation of a secondary phase, and Br− is uniformly distributed on the surface and has a gradient distribution in the vertical direction. Furthermore, by optimizing the CTAB solution concentration, the MAPbI3 device with CTAB demonstrated an optimum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.95% with a steady-state output PCE of 18.11%. Finally, the MAPbI3 device treated with CTAB exhibited better moisture resistance, with no obvious decline observed during the storage stability test for 1600 h under dry conditions in the dark. Furthermore, the device treated with CTAB showed better operational stability under 1 sun illumination at the maximum power point (retaining over 60% of its initial PCE for 1800 min) compared with that of the MAPbI3 device.
1. Introduction
Recently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have exhibited unique optoelectronic properties, including high absorption in the visible region, long carrier diffusion lengths, and relatively high defect tolerance, and have emerged as one of the most attractive solar cell materials for third-generation photovoltaic solar cells.1–4 In the last several years, the best PCE of halide PSCs has progressed unprecedentedly from 3.8%5 to a certified value of 23.7%.6 However, the large number of defects and recombination centers at the grain boundaries (GBs) and surface of perovskite films lead to short carrier lifetimes,7,8 a low open-circuit voltage (Voc),9,10 and unsatisfactory stability,11 which limit the further development of PSCs.
A wide variety of additives have been used to control the film growth, reduce the defects and recombination centers, and form uniform and compact surfaces of perovskite layers through interfacial passivation and compositional engineering.12–20 Peng et al. introduced poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to passivate defects and suppress interfacial recombination, with the device achieving a Voc of ∼1.18 V with negligible hysteresis.21,22 The Huang group demonstrated that incorporating a sulfonic zwitterion (DPSI) was an effective method for passivating the perovskite defects and boosting the PCE of small-area (0.08 cm2) planar perovskite devices to 21.1% with good light stability.23 Salim et al. improved the PSCs using a hydrophobic fluorinated organic salt (PFPAI), which promoted the PCE and moisture stability.24 Jiang et al. and several other groups found that a small amount of residual PbI2 in the perovskite film could passivate defects to obtain high-efficiency and stable devices without hysteresis.25,26 Zhou and coworkers discussed the passivation effect of Cl− in FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 perovskite films and obtained a high PCE and Voc.27,28 Therefore, passivation is a crucial and effective method for improving device performance and stability.
Recently, hydrophobic ammonium salts with dual functional groups have attracted increasing attention owing to their hydrophobic properties and passivation roles. Various ammonium salts have been shown to play crucial roles.29 Cai et al. reported that adding trimethylammonium chloride (TACl) reduce grain boundaries and increased the charge carrier diffusion length, leading to a PCE of 20.92% with a high Voc of 1.15 V.30 The Grätzel group introduced molecular modulator 1-adamantylamine (ADA) to reduce the interface defects, which resulted in the Voc being increased by 60 mV to 1.17 V with a high PCE of 21.3%.31 The same group also synthesized adamantylammonium halides to suppress non-radiative recombination, resulting in an increased PCE of almost 22% with a high Voc of ∼1.185 V.32 Furthermore, ammonium salts have also been incorporated to form high-quality 2D/3D films and devices.33–36 Dai et al. introduced short-chain hydrophobic alkylammonium salts (2-chloroethylamine, CEA+ and 2-bromoethylamine, BEA+) to form 2D/3D perovskite structures, achieving satisfactory PCEs and superior moisture stability.37 However, the performance and stability of MAPbI3 remains unsatisfactory, especially regarding moisture stability. Therefore, a multifunctional ammonium salt that can not only passivate the defects, but also improve the performance and stability in MAPbI3 is greatly needed.
In this study, we introduced multifunctional ammonium salt cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) onto the surface of perovskite films through interface modification without the formation of an extra phase. The performance and stability were clearly enhanced owing to the resulting Br− diffusion, passivation effect, and hydrophobicity treatment. The attachment of long carbon chains to the perovskite surface improved the stability to humidity. A suitable amount of Br− doping could increase energy level and arrange crystal grain growth. The ammonium group in CTA+ on the perovskite film surface suppressed trap states in the perovskite films. Furthermore, the moisture resistance of the device was enhanced by the hydrophobic long chain of CTAB. Finally, by optimizing the CTAB solution concentration, the MAPbI3 device achieved optimum performance, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.95%, a steady-state output PCE of 18.11%, and a champion PCE of 20.28% for planar PSCs using FA0.95MA0.05Pb(I,Br)3 absorber. Furthermore, the MAPbI3 device treated with CTAB exhibited better moisture resistance and retained over 65% of the initial PCE after aging at 75 ± 5% RH for 360 h. The storage stability was tested for 1600 h under dry condition in the dark, with no obvious decline detected. The device treated with CTAB showed better operational stability under 1 sun illumination at the maximum power point (retaining over 60% of its initial PCE for 1800 min) compared with that of the MAPbI3 device.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
SnO2 colloid precursor (Sn(IV) oxide, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion), anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), anhydrous isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and chlorobenzene were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Methylammonium iodide, PbI2, and spiro-OMeTAD were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Co., Ltd. Glucose, lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) were obtained from Aldrich. All commercially available materials were used as received without any further purification.
2.2 Materials preparation
Carbon nanodots were synthesized according to our previously reported procedure.38 The CND-doped SnO2 solution was prepared by mixing carbon nanodots (CNDs) with SnO2 colloid precursor. The MAPbI3 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 1.2 M PbI2 and MAI (1:1 molar ratio) in anhydrous DMF/DMSO (9:1, v/v). The 1.2 M FA0.95MA0.05Pb(I,Br)3 perovskite precursor solution was prepared in mixed solvent (DMF/DMSO = 4:1, v/v). CTAB was dissolved in isopropanol at concentrations of 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 mg mL−1. Spiro-OMeTAD/CB solution (72.3 mg mL−1) was prepared using LiTFSI/ACN solution (17.5 μL, 520 mg mL−1) and TBP (28.8 μL).
2.3 Device fabrication
ITO glass substrates were cleaned with detergent, deionized water, and ethanol for 25 min. The CND-doped SnO2 solution was spin-coated on the ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 20 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. To prepare the MAPbI3 film, precursor solution (80 μL) was coated on the SnO2:CNDs substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. CB (100 μL) was then rapidly dropped onto the substrate 20 s before spin coating was ended. The film was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. To prepare the FA0.95MA0.05Pb(I,Br)3 film, the precursor solution was formed using a two-step process, at 1000 rpm for 5 s and 5000 rpm for 30 s, followed by rapidly dropping CB (100 μL) 20 s before the end of the second spin coating step. The obtained film was annealed at 105 °C for 20 min. The perovskite film was further treated with CTAB/IPA solution and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The spiro-OMeTAD layer was formed at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, thermal evaporation was used to form the 80 nm gold back contact.
2.4 Characterization
SEM images and energy dispersive spectrometry were obtained using a ZEISS SUPRA55 microscope. TEM images and EDS were obtained using a JEM 1200EX microscope. XRD was conducted using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm) at 40 kV and 150 mA. UPS spectra were analyzed using an AC-2 gas detector (Riken Keiki, Japan). The photovoltaic performance was tested using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G illumination with a solar light simulator. Electrochemistry measurements were conducted using a CHI660d electrochemistry station. UV-vis spectrophotometry was performed using a Lambda 950 spectrophotometer. EQE measurements were obtained using a DK240 monochromator from 350 to 800 nm. PL and TRPL spectra were measured using a FLS 980 E fluorometer with excitation at 532 nm. The active cell area was 0.1 cm2.
3. Results and discussion
Planar n–i–p PSCs with a glass/ITO/SnO2:CNDs/MAPbI3/CTAB/spiro-OMeTAD/Au structure were prepared in this study. The SnO2:CNDs electron transport layer (ETL) was prepared using a process we reported previously.38 Introducing carbon nanodots (CNDs) is an effective method for enhancing the properties of SnO2. The hole transport layer (HTL) was obtained by spin-coating with a spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene solution. CTAB as an alkylammonium salt containing a long carbon chain, a positively charged ammonium group, and a negatively charged halogen functional group. A schematic illustration of Br− vertical diffusion and CTA+ surface passivation on the MAPbI3 perovskite thin film during the annealing process is shown in Fig. 1. The ammonium group in CTA+ was anchored to the surface and grain boundaries of the perovskite film owing to hydrogen bonding between the positively charged ammonium group and lead.39 Meanwhile, attachment of the long carbon chain to the perovskite surface improved the humidity stability. The halogen functional groups in CTAB were uniformly distributed on the surface and had a gradient distribution in the vertical direction.

SEM images of perovskite films treated with various concentrations of CTAB are shown in Fig. 2a and b. The MAPbI3 film and the film with 1-CTAB presented smooth and compact morphologies without any holes, demonstrating that excellent device performance could be realized. Some changes in the perovskite particle morphology were observed owing to the adhesive action of CTA+ and the diffusion of Br− during the annealing process.23,37 The grain size distributions are shown in Fig. 2c. The average grain size in MAPbI3 film was about 160 nm, while that in the CTAB-treated film was 20 nm smaller with a much narrower distribution compared with that of the MAPbI3 film. This indicated that the growth of the perovskite film was well arranged to give a uniform grain size and compact film. However, as shown in Fig. S1,† when the CTAB concentration was increased to 2 and 5 mg mL−1, the perovskite films were formed with much smaller grain size, pinholes, and aggregation, which might result in PCE degradation.

(f) XPS spectra of Br 3d peaks of perovskite films with and without CTAB. 
UV-vis spectra of the perovskite films with and without CTAB are shown in Fig. 2d. A small blue shift of about 2 nm was present owing to Br− diffusion. Furthermore, XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 2e and S2,† were recorded to analyze the effect of CTAB on the perovskite crystal structure. The MAPbI3 film treated with CTAB (1 mg mL−1) exhibited a similar XRD pattern to the MAPbI3 film without impurity phase and peak shift. To explore the effect of Br− on the XRD pattern, magnified spectra at 13–16° were recorded, as shown in Fig. S2(b),† with peaks observed at 14.14° and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) also shown. The FWHM of the CTAB-treated films was smaller than that of the control film, indicating better crystallization. The sample treated with 2 mg mL−1 CTAB displayed a larger FWHM owing to aggregation and coverage of CTAB on the perovskite film surface. XPS was conducted and I 3d, Pb 4f, and Br 3d peaks for the perovskite films are shown in Fig. 2f and S3.† No distinct shift in the I 3d and Pb 4f peaks was observed for the MA film with different CTAB concentrations, while the emerging peak of Br 3d in the 1- and 5-CTAB films confirmed the introduction of CTAB. The XPS results indicated that a slight variation in stoichiometric ratio did not lead to a change in chemical environment. Furthermore, UPS spectra were also used to analyze changes in the energy level with Br doping, as shown in Fig. S4a and S4b.† The work functions of the MAPbI3 film and the film with CTAB were −4.28 eV and −4.18 eV, while the valence band were at −5.62 eV and −5.52 eV, respectively. The up-shifted valence band in the MAPbI3 film with CTAB suggested the incorporation of a very small amount of Br−. The presence of MAPb(I,Br)3 in the MAPbI3 film would enhance the hole conduction and prevent electron transportation. The UV-vis spectra, XRD patterns, XPS spectra, and UPS spectra suggested that a very small amount of Br doping changed the band gap and energy levels instead of the phase structure and chemical environment.40
As the MAPbI3 film treated with CTAB during the annealing process could induce Br/I ion exchange, it was necessary to explore whether the Br− distribution was homogeneous or depth-dependent.41 The cross-section image of the CTAB device is shown in Fig. 3a. A dense and uniform cross-section morphology was observed, illustrating the suppressed trap state density and enhanced carrier transport ability of the device.42 However, owing to the limitations of SEM resolution, the cross-sectional TEM image of the CTAB device was used to further observe the distribution depth of Br−, as shown in Fig. 3b. Each layer was clearly distinguished. Elemental mapping for Br, Pb, I, and Sn in the CTAB device obtained from the TEM image is shown in Fig. 3d, and demonstrated that Pb and I were uniformly distributed in perovskite films. Meanwhile, the Br ions were vertically distributed in the depth of the perovskite film. EDX maps measured on the surface showed homogeneous distributions of Pb, C, N, Br, and I, as shown in Fig. S5.† The atom contents of Pb, C, N, Br, and I on the surface in the 1-CTAB-treated film are shown in Table S1.† The observed Br content was only 1.27%, which agreed well with the UV-vis spectra, XRD patterns, and XPS spectra. Furthermore, cross-section element profiling of the CTAB-treated film is shown in Fig. 3c. A small amount of C between the perovskite film and ITO indicated the introduction of CNDs. The Br content increased in the perovskite layer, with a slight increase in Br content observed from 500 to 650 nm, showing that Br had a gradient distribution in the CTAB film.

To assess the passivation effect of CTAB, the trap densities of hole-only and electron-only devices were determined using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in Fig. 4, the ohmic region, trap-filling limited region, and space-charge-limited-current were generally present in the C–V curves.30 The ohmic response and trap filling continuously increasing with voltage would lead to the termination of a linear J–V relationship.43 For the hole-only device, as shown in Fig. 4a and b, the trap-filling limited voltage (VTFL) was estimated to be 1.01 V for the MAPbI3 device and 0.78 V for the CTAB device. The results for the electron-only device are shown in Fig. 4c and d. VTFL was reduced from 0.70 V to 0.62 V with CTAB passivation. The trap state density (ntrap) was calculated using the formula: (1)where L is the film thickness, ε is the relative dielectric constant of MAPbI3, and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity. The hole trap density and electron trap density of the CTAB device were only 4.53 × 1015 cm−3 and 3.60 × 1015 cm−3, respectively, which were lower than those of the control device (5.87 × 1015 cm−3 and 4.06 × 1015 cm−3), indicating the effective passivation of cations and anions by CTAB.

The PL and TRPL were also successfully measured to determine the crystalline properties of the perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 5a, the perovskite film treated with CTAB centered at 772 nm showed a slight blue shift and enhanced PL intensity compared with the MAPbI3 film. This suggested an improved crystal quality and reduced trap-state density. These results agreed with the UV-vis spectra. As shown in Fig. 5b, TRPL was fitted using a biexponential decay function, showing a fast decay, τ1, and a slow component, τ2. Short lifetime τ1 and long lifetime τ2 represent surface and bulk recombination.44 As shown in Table S2,† the CTAB device gave a surface and bulk recombination lifetimes of 66.49 and 121.00 ns, respectively, which were much longer than those of the MAPbI3 device (13.01 and 62.73 ns, respectively).

The energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 6a. To study the enhanced behavior of the device performance, the J–V characteristics of MAPbI3 devices treated with different CTAB concentrations were measured, as shown in Fig. 6b. The results are summarized in Table 1. The control MAPbI3 device showed typical performance, with a short current density (Jsc) of 22.87 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.05 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.71, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.99%. When the CTAB concentration was increased to 0.5 and 1 mg mL−1, the PCE was significantly increased to 17.78% and 18.95% with a continuously increasing Voc of 1.07 V and 1.11 V, respectively. The best device was obtained by treating the MAPbI3 film with 1 mg mL−1 of CTAB, resulting in a slightly increased Jsc of 23.20 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.74, a high Voc of 1.11 V, and the best PCE of 18.95%. These results might be due to the improved film morphology, up-shifted energy level, and the passivation effect achieved by the CTA+ ammonium group and Br−. However, when the CTAB concentration was increased to 2 and 5 mg mL−1, the Voc and FF values decreased significantly owing to much smaller grain sizes, pinholes, and aggregation. The performance of CTAB devices treated with different rotation speeds were also investigated, as shown in Fig. S6.† The optimum rotation speed was 5000 rpm, with obvious variations in the Voc observed, suggesting that an insulating CTAB layer with increased thickness was formed at low speed and that an incomplete reaction might occur at high speed.

The photocurrent hysteresis of the pure MAPbI3 device and 1-CTAB device was also measured. J–V curves of the optimum device in different scan directions are shown in Fig. 6c, and the relevant J–V parameters are listed in Table 2. We calculated the hysteresis index using the following equation: h = (PCEreverse − PCEforward)/PCEreverse.45 Negligible hysteresis was observed for the CTAB device, with PCEs of 18.95% and 17.73% obtained in various scan directions for the CTAB device, while PCEs of only 16.99% and 13.88% were obtained in various scan directions by the MAPbI3 device. The hysteresis index of the CTAB device was 6.44%, which was much lower than that of the MAPbI3 device (18.30%). This lower hysteresis index further verified the enhanced device performance.46

We also measured the steady-state power output by monitoring the device photocurrent at the maximum power point under AM 1.5G illumination. As shown in Fig. 6d, the CTAB device exhibited a stabilized PCE of 18.11% with a current density of 19.97 mA cm−2 for 200 s, while the MAPbI3 device presented a PCE of only 16.43% with a current density of 19.44 mA cm−2. EQE spectra are shown in Fig. 6d. The CTAB device exhibited an EQE above 80% from 400 to 760 nm, which reached 90% in the wavelength range of 500–600 nm, indicating enhanced charge extraction and transfer resulting from CTAB treatment. Meanwhile, the EQE spectra for the MAPbI3 and the CTAB devices showed integrated current densities of 22.03 and 21.10 mA cm−2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6e, the PCE distribution statistics showed the reproducibility of the performance enhancement produced by CTAB. Furthermore, the Voc dependence on light intensity was determined, as shown in Fig. S9,† to elucidate the carrier recombination mechanism during device operation. A slope of 1.32 kT/q was estimated for the CTAB device, which was much lower than that of the MAPbI3 device (2.45 kT/q), indicating reduced trap-assisted recombination.
To check whether the enhanced behavior of CTAB could impact devices with different perovskite compositions, we selected mixed composition FA0.95MA0.05Pb(I,Br)3 to fabricate a device, with the device structure shown in Fig. S7a.† SnO2:CNDs, FA0.95MA0.05Pb(I,Br)3, and spiro-OMeTAD were used as the ETL, absorption layer, and HTL, respectively. As shown in Fig. S7b,† the performance of the FA0.95MA0.05Pb(I,Br)3 device yielded a PCE of only 17.23%, with a Jsc of 22.75 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.09 V, and FF of 0.69. MACl was incorporated into the perovskite precursor solution to play a bulk passivation role in the FA0.95MA0.05Pb(I,Br)3 device, as reported in other literature.47 An increased PCE of 19.62% was obtained with a Jsc of 23.17 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.11 V and FF of 0.76. Furthermore, the best FA0.95MA0.05Pb(I,Br)3:MACl device treated with CTAB reached a high PCE of 20.28% with a Jsc of 23.40 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.14 V, and FF of 0.76. All parameters were enhanced significantly, especially the Voc (from 1.09 to 1.14 V). Top-surface SEM images of samples are shown in Fig. S8.† All films were fabricated uniformly without any holes. Perovskite particles with small grain sizes (around 200 nm) were observed for the FA0.95MA0.05Pb(I,Br)3 film (Fig. S8a†), and the grain size increased continuously, ranging from 300 to 800 nm, with the introduction of MACl and CTAB, indicating enhanced performance of the FA0.95MA0.05Pb(I,Br)3:MACl/CTAB device (Fig. S8b and S8c†). Fig. S7c† shows the EQE spectrum and integral current density for the FA0.95MA0.05Pb(I,Br)3:MACl/CTAB device. An EQE above 80% was observed in the region of 400 to 760 nm, and an integral current density of 22.50 mA cm−2 was calculated, which agreed with the J–V results. The PCE distribution statistics (Fig. S7d†) showed the enhancement effect of CTAB on the FA0.95MA0.05Pb(I,Br)3:MACl device.
Impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements were also conducted to compare the electronic characteristics of the MAPbI3 device with and without CTAB. The Nyquist plots tested under AM 1.5G irradiation at a direct current bias of 0 V are shown in Fig. 7a, with the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 7a, and the results are presented in Table S3.† The CTAB device showed a smaller transfer resistance (Rtr) of 3.6 Ω and larger recombination resistance (Rrec) of 408.2 Ω compared with the MAPbI3 device, indicating reduced charge recombination and efficient charge extraction. Furthermore, IS measurements tested in the dark under different applied biases were also conducted, as shown in Fig. 7b and c. The larger Rrec value of the CTAB device indicated suppression of the recombination process compared with the MAPbI3 device. The Rs value of the CTAB device was similar to that of the MAPbI3 device (Fig. 7c). All results were responsible for enhanced performance of the CTAB device. Fig. 7d shows the Mott–Schottky analysis of ITO/SnO2:CNDs/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au at 1 kHz. The Vbi value of the CTAB device was 0.96 V, which was about 0.06 V higher than that of the MAPbI3 device. These results further verified the enhanced charge extraction ability and suppressed recombination resulting from the passivation behavior of CTAB.

Stability is a challenging issue for perovskite devices, especially humidity stability. Photographs of perovskite films without and with CTAB on the surface with a drop of water on the surface are shown in Fig. 8a. The CTAB film remained dark while the film without CTAB rapidly became yellow. This indicated that the hydrophobicity of the MAPbI3 film was significantly enhanced owing to the long carbon chain of CTA+. Fig. 8b and c show the water contact angle of the perovskite film without and with CTAB. The water contact angle increasing from 50.56° to 93.49° with CTAB treatment. To investigate the humidity stability of the devices, we tested the devices without and with CTAB at 10–20 °C under 75 ± 5% relative humidity (RH) without any encapsulation for 360 h, with the results shown in Fig. 8d and S11.† Images of the PSCs with or without CTAB tested under different humidities for 200 h, respectively, are shown in Fig. S10.† The MAPbI3 device treated with CTAB exhibited better moisture resistance and retained over 65% of the initial PCE after aging for 360 h. A PCE shape decrease was observed in the first 50 h, which might be attributed to the degradation of spiro-OMeTAD. The PCE of the MAPbI3 device without CTAB decreased below 50% quickly in 60 h. The storage stability was tested in dark and dry condition for 1600 h, as shown in Fig. 8e. This showed that the CTAB device maintained more than 95% of the initial PCE after 1600 h. Furthermore, the operational stability of non-encapsulated devices with or without CTAB was tested by tracking their maximum power points under 1 sun illumination and ambient conditions (20–40% humidity, 20 ± 5 °C). The results indicated that the device with CTAB showed better performance, maintaining more than 60% of its initial PCE after 1800 min, while the device without CTAB had degraded severely after 300 min. Better humidity, storage stability, and operational stability were observed with the introduction of CTAB.

4. Conclusion
In summary, the multifunctional ammonium salt CTAB was introduced onto the surface of perovskite films through interface modification. Long-chain CTA+ cations from CTAB anchored to the MAPbI3 film surface without forming an extra phase, while Br− was uniformly distributed on the surface with a gradient distribution in the vertical direction. The photovoltaic performance and device stability were improved significantly owing to Br− diffusion, the passivation effect, and hydrophobicity treatment. Finally, by optimizing the CTAB solution concentration, a MAPbI3 device with CTAB with optimum performance was obtained, demonstrating a PCE of 18.95% with a steady-state output PCE of 18.11%. Furthermore, the MAPbI3 device treated with CTAB exhibited better moisture resistance, storage stability, and operational stability under 1 sun illumination at the maximum power point.
