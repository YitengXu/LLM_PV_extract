    , Accepted 9th March 2020First published on 10th March 2020AbstractThe plasmon effect on the catalytic performance of metal nanoparticles (NPs) has shown great potential for the design of novel catalytic reactions. However, the intrinsic mechanisms underlying the catalysis triggered by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) are still ambiguous. In this work, we construct Au@AgPt hollow urchin-like structures (Au@AgPt HUSs) with an ultra-thin Pt shell for the electrocatalytic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in an alkaline solution under irradiation (200 mW cmm−2). A superior MOR mass activity (3.26 A mg−1 Pt) is achieved on Au@AgPt HUSs, which is 5.43 times that of commercial Pt black catalysts (0.6 A mg−1 Pt) under irradiation. It is also reported that localized heating, which results from the photothermal effect under irradiation, can accelerate the reaction kinetics of MOR over Au@AgPt HUSs. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the reduced lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of CO induced by the localized electric field can accelerate the rate-determining step *CO to *COOH, and the energetic hot carriers provide energy to promote the transfer of *CO from the hollow Pt site to the top Pt site. Thus, the hollow Pt active sites poisoned by *CO can be reactivated due to the *CO transfer mechanism, leading to more available active sites for the MOR process. This work reveals the intrinsic effect of LSPR on catalysis and paves the way to boost conventional catalytic reactions by introducing solar energy flux.
1. Introduction
With high-efficiency and low-pollution characteristics, direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have shown favorable potential as future power source devices.1–4 Due to the diversity of catalysts, especially in the cathode, the development of DMFCs in alkaline solution has attracted increasing attention compared with DMFCs in acidic media.5 Although platinum, which is a versatile catalyst candidate, has been extensively studied in multiple fields, especially in DMFCs, the limited reserves of platinum have greatly hindered its industrial application in DMFCs. To improve the utilization efficiency of platinum, various strategies have been explored, such as intermetallicization, alloying, and construction of core–shell structures, for example, by introducing cost-effective elements.6–11
Interestingly, the introduction of plasmonic metal, such as gold or silver, can yield unique localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects in the composite metal-catalysts by regulating their feasible component ratio, geometry and structure.12–14 The collective oscillation of the valence electrons in plasmonic metals, which is excited by light irradiation, can generate the high-energy electron–hole pairs on their surface. In previous experiments, Lee et al. demonstrated that the LSPR effects amplified the hot electron flow generated on a gold thin film under illumination.15 Consequently, these LSPR-induced charge carriers would interact with the adjoining charge acceptors or adsorbed molecules to effectively promote the catalytic reaction. Therefore, based on the unique features of the LSPR effect from plasmonic metals, the design of electrocatalysts for various reactions, such as Suzuki coupling reactions,16 CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR),17,18 electrocatalytic methanol and ethanol oxidation reaction (MOR),19 hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)20 and oxygen evolution reaction (OER),21 has attracted considerable attention all over the world.22–26 For example, Xu and co-workers found that the existence of an Au component in PtAu@Pt nanodendrites greatly promoted their photo-electrocatalytic performance in both methanol and ethanol oxidation reactions.19 Lee et al. proposed that constructing a thin silica interlayer in the Cu2O/Au vertex site of the hexoctahedral Au and Cu2O components can distinguish the photothermal and hot electron effects in CO oxidation reactions.27 Moon and co-workers verified that the hot electron can enhance the activity of photoelectrochemical water splitting performed on AuNPs/TiO2 nanotube arrays.28 Furthermore, Zhang et al. demonstrated that introducing Au nanoparticles into porous N-doped carbon and Ni(OH)2 nanosheets could enhance their HER and OER performance, respectively, which was ascribed to the plasmon effects of Au.20,21 In our previous work, we have proved that the photothermal effect and surface charge heterogeneity caused by LSPR effect on the surface of AgPt hollow nanospheres can effectively improve their MOR activity and CO poisoning tolerance.29
It should be noted that the LSPR effects of plasmonic metal greatly depend on its geometry, especially for structures with a high curvature radius, which would exhibit the unique tip effect. Furthermore, coupling multiple plasmonic metals with different d-band structures, while maintaining the unique high curvature tip morphology, would provide a rare opportunity to systematically and quantitatively reveal their LSPR effects, including photothermal, hot carriers and localized electric fields, on the adsorbate and further to optimize the catalytic reaction path. Thus, we designed and synthesized novel Au@AgPt hollow urchin-like structures (Au@AgPt HUSs) with a Pt shell (∼1.0 nm) by a modified wet chemical method for electrocatalytic MOR in alkaline media. It was found that the species of Au, Ag, and Pt contained in the as-prepared HUSs served as the light absorber and plasmon donor, anti-poisoning agent and catalytic active site, respectively. Theoretical calculations (i.e., finite-difference-time-domain [FDTD] and density functional theories [Gaussian and Vienna Ab initio simulation package; VASP]) were used to systematically explore intrinsic mechanisms underlying the enhanced MOR activity induced by LSPR effects. Available reaction schemes for MOR on Au@AgPt(111) and Au@Pt(111) have been addressed using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of Ag NPs (seeds)
Typically, 1 mL of sodium citrate (NaCA) aqueous solution (5 mM) and 1 mL of HAuCl4 (5 mM) were added into a 25 mL bottle containing 18 mL of H2O. And then, 0.6 mL of NaBH4 queues solution (0.1 M) was added into the bottle under vigorous stirring. The solution immediately became yellowish, indicating the formation of Au nanocluster. Finally, the Au seeds solution was obtained after aging for 4 h.
2.2 Synthesis of Ag NPs (growth process)
In a typical synthesis, 1 g polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (K-30) was dissolved into 40 mL H2O. Then, 10 mL acetonitrile (ACN), 1.5 mL AgNO3 (0.1 M) and 2 mL L-ascorbic acid (AA, 0.1 M) were mixed with the above PVP solution, sequentially. 100 μL Au seed solution was injected into the mixture quickly. After stirring for 15 min, the obtained sample was centrifuged (9000 rpm, 5 min) and washed four times with H2O to remove the excessive PVP. Finally, the Ag sphere was re-dispersed into 50 mL deionized (DI) water for further experiments.
2.3 Synthesis of Au@AgPt hollow urchin-like nanostructure
In a typical synthesis, 3.3 mL Ag sphere solution was diluted with 10.7 mL DI water, then 2 mL HAuCl4 (25 mM) and 5 mL L-dopa (10 mM, freshly prepared) were added in order. After 30 s, 110 μL AA (0.1 M) and 100 μL K2PtCl4 (10 mM) were added, sequentially. The solution stood for 15 min to allow the reaction to proceed. Then, the product was centrifuged (7000 rpm, 5 min) and washed three times with DI and ethanol to remove the surfactants.
2.4 Synthesis of Au hollow urchin-like nanostructure
Au hollow urchin-like nanostructure (Au HUSs) was synthesized via a process similar to that of Au@AgPt hollow urchin-like nanostructure, except that no AA or K2PtCl4 was added.
2.5 Synthesis of Au@Pt hollow urchin-like nanostructure
The above obtained Au HUSs were first dispersed into a 50 mL bottle containing 21 mL DI water. After stirring at 300 rpm for 1 min, 110 μL AA (0.1 M, freshly prepared) was added, followed by injection of 100 μL K2PtCl4 (10 mM) in 2 min intervals. After 15 min, the mixture was centrifuged (7000 rpm, 5 min) and washed three times with DI and ethanol to remove the surfactants. Finally, the resultant was dispersed into 2 mL ethanol.
2.6 Synthesis of Au@Ag hollow urchin-like nanostructure
Au@Ag hollow urchin-like nanostructure was synthesized by a method similar to that of Au@AgPt hollow urchin-like nanostructure, except for the addition of K2PtCl4.
2.7 Characterizations
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra were measured on a UV-vis-near infrared (NIR) spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-4100). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance) with a Cu Kα X-ray source (λ = 1.5405 Å). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed with a JEOL JEM-2100 operating at 200 kV. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), high angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and elemental mapping analysis were performed on a JEM-F200 transmission electron microscope (TEM) at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was recorded on a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi, S-4700). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were characterized with the Thermo VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 spectrometer equipping an Al Kα X-ray source of 1486.8 eV at a chamber pressure below 1 × 10−8 torr and beam power of 200 W. The binding energy was corrected with reference to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. The real Pt mass loadings were measured through the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES 5300).
2.8 Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical experiments were performed in a three-electrode system on a CHI 660 E electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Shanghai, Chenhua Co.). The Au@AgPt hollow urchin loaded L-typed glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 5 mm in diameter) was used as a working electrode. A Pt mesh (1 cm × 1 cm) and an Ag/AgCl electrode (0.1989 V vs. NHE, saturated KCl, at 30 °C) were used as the counter and the reference electrode, respectively. The irradiation intensity was measured by a full spectrum optical power meter (CEL-NP2000-2, Beijing China Education Au-light Co., Ltd). The light source was a xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300/300UV, Trusttech Co., Ltd. Beijing) equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter.
The catalyst ink was prepared by ultrasonic dispersing 400 μg catalysts into a mixture solution contained 87 μL isopropanol, 3 μL Nafion (5%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 μL H2O for 1 h in an ice bath. All samples were loaded on the L-type GCE with a Pt mass loading of ∼10 μg. Electrochemical measurements were performed at 30 °C with a circulating water bath temperature control device refraining from a large perturbation in temperature. MOR measurements were performed in an N2-saturated solution containing 0.5 M NaOH and 1 M methanol at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in the potential range of −1.0–0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl).
2.9 Photothermal experiment
To acquire the photothermal performance of Au@AgPt HUSs, Au@Pt HUSs and commercial J&M Pt black, the photothermal experiments were performed in 30 mL electrolyte contained in a watch glass (diameter 94 mm) while the total-metal mass was controlled equivalently. Typically, 10 mg Au@AgPt HUSs was loaded on a glass slide (25.4 mm × 76.2 mm × 0.9 mm, SAIL Brand, cat no. 7101) with an effective area (18.0 mm × 18.0 mm). All samples Au@AgPt HUSs, Au@Pt HUSs, commercial J&M Pt black and the glass slide were irradiated vertically in the MOR electrolyte media by a xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300/300UV, Trusttech Co., Ltd. Beijing) equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter. The irradiation power density was set at 200 mW cm−2. A Fluke Ti 10 infrared (IR) camera was used to record the IR photographs. Data collection was conducted with a time interval sampling method from recorded videos. The ambient temperature was stabilized at 25.0 ± 0.5 °C.
2.10 FDTD calculation
To verify the extinction spectra and spatial electric field distribution of Au@AgPt HUSs, Au@Pt HUSs, Au@Ag HUSs and Au HUSs under a beam of sunlight irradiation, the FDTD simulation (8.11.337 version, Lumerical Solutions, Inc.) was performed as an effective approach with perfectly matched layers (PML) in three dimensions (3Ds) as boundary conditions. A unit cell of 400 nm × 400 nm × 400 nm in 3Ds was set for all nanostructures. Total-field scattered-field (TFSF) linearly polarized light waves in the 300–1200 nm range were induced into the unit cell along the −z direction. The amplitude of the electric field vector of incident TFSF linearly polarized light vector was set to 1 V m−1, while a frequency-domain field profile monitor in the x–y plane was utilized to collect field profile data. The complex refractive indexes of Ag and Pt were set as “Johnson and Christy”.25,29 While, the complex refractive index of Au was set as “Au (Gold)-CRC”.30 All the complex refractive indexes were employed from the material database provided by Lumerical.25 Geometric parameters of simulation structures were obtained from the average actual dimensions of Au@AgPt HUSs, Au@Pt HUSs, Au@Ag HUSs and Au HUSs, respectively. Because all samples were dispersed in an aqueous environment, the refractive index of the simulation medium was set to be 1.33.
2.11 Theoretic calculation (Gaussian)
To explore the effect of the applied electric field toward molecular orbitals (MOs) of a single CO molecule, DFT calculations were carried out using the B3LYP functional31 and 6-31+G(d,p) basis set, which were performed using the Gaussian 09W package.32 The direction of the applied electric field was set in parallel with the bonding direction of C–O (from C to O) because of the vertical adsorption behavior of the CO molecule on the catalytic substrate. MO energy levels and band gaps were calculated under a series of electric fields with field strengths (0.0003, 0.003, 0.03, and 0.1 Hartree/Bohr).
2.12 Theoretic calculation (VASP)
Calculations were performed on the basis of spin-polarized DFT using projector augmented wave (PAW) methods, as implemented in the VASP.33,34 We used the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) to describe the exchange–correlation interactions.35 Structural relaxations were performed by computing the Hellmann–Feynman forces within the total energy and force convergences of 10−4 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. Herein, the (111) surface was constructed and a supercell of 3 × 3 × 1 was employed. In order to simulate the interface in electrode, models of three atom layers were considered. To minimize the interaction between two slabs, a 20 Å vacuum separation was set in a direction perpendicular to the slab. The Brillouin-zone integration was sampled with 3 × 3 × 1 k-points Monkhorst–Pack mesh.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the SEM image of as-prepared Au@AgPt HUSs, which exhibited a geometric size of 353.4 ± 33.6 nm (inset in Fig. 1a). It was clear that the typical hollow urchin-like morphology of Au@AgPt HUSs (Fig. 1b) was completely inherited from that of Au@Ag HUSs (Fig. S1†). The selected area (electron) diffraction (SAED) pattern of Au@AgPt HUSs (inset in Fig. 1b) showed diffraction spots, which can be indexed to (111), (200), (220) and (222) lattice planes of the Au and Pt-based faced-centered cubic (fcc) structure, proving the polycrystalline nature of the HUSs. The HRTEM image in Fig. 1c reveals the lattice fringes measured from a single tip of Au@AgPt HUS with the spacings of ca. 0.24 nm and 0.22 nm, matching well with the d-spacing of Au(111) and Pt(111), respectively. The HAADF-STEM image in Fig. 1d shows the different contrast between the central and exterior part of the three separate nanotips of a single Au@AgPt HUS. The elemental mapping shown in Fig. 1e–h further confirms the spatial distribution of Pt, Ag and Au. Moreover, the EDS line-scan profiles of Pt, Ag and Au were collected across three separate nanotips of a single Au@AgPt HUS (Fig. 1i). The line-scan profile of the three Au@AgPt nanotips exhibited higher counts in internal for Au species and lower counts at external for that of Ag and Pt, demonstrating that a core–shell structure was inherited from the Au@Ag HUSs (Fig. S1f–i†). An ultra-thin Pt layer (∼1 nm) deposited on Au@Ag HUSs substrate can be deduced from the line-scan profile (Fig. 1i) and the magnified HAADF-STEM image of precursor Au@Ag HUSs (Fig. S1k†). Meanwhile, the contents of element Pt, Ag, and Au in Au@AgPt HUSs were measured by ICP-AES and EDS analysis, as shown in Table S1 and S2.† The XPS characterization was used to investigate the surface composition and valence state of the as-prepared Au@AgPt HUSs (Fig. 2).36,37 As shown in Fig. 2a, the signals of Pt 4f, Au 4f, and Ag 3d are detected in Au@AgPt HUSs. In detail, the fine high-resolution XPS spectrum of Pt shows two main peaks at 70.7 and 74.0 eV (Fig. 2b), which correspond to the Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2, respectively.36 As shown in Fig. 2c, the Au element mainly exists in the metallic state, where the Au 4f scan shows a primary doublet at 83.9 and 87.6 eV, with a split orbit of 3.7 eV.37 Furthermore, the fine high-resolution XPS spectrum of intermediate layer Ag shell shows two main peaks of Ag 3d5/2 (367.7 eV) and Ag 3d3/2 (373.7 eV) (Fig. 2d), respectively.38 The spin energy separation (6.0 eV) and intensity ratio of 2:3 indicate that the Ag species contained in Au@AgPt HUSs mainly exists in the metallic state. In addition, the XRD patterns recorded from the samples of Au@AgPt HUSs and Au@Pt HUSs (Fig. S2†) show similar diffraction peaks of pure Au (JCPDS no. 04-0784),39 confirming the typical fcc structure.

The electrocatalytic MOR experiments were performed in an aqueous NaOH solution (0.5 M) containing methanol (1.0 M) under irradiation (200 mW cm−2) and dark conditions to explore the LSPR effects on the catalytic activity of Au@AgPt HUSs, Au@Pt HUSs, and commercial Pt black, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3a, all peaks presented at −0.09 to −0.05 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in forward scanning were ascribed to the electro-oxidation of methanol. Clearly, the peak intensity correlated with the Au@AgPt HUSs for MOR was greatly improved under irradiation, indicating that the kinetics of the MOR were accelerated due to the plasmon effect of Au and Ag in Au@AgPt HUSs. Other peaks at around 0.18 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) presented in backward scanning can be attributed to the further oxidation of intermediates (mainly as CO) absorbed on the surface of the Pt species and the consequential reactivation of oxidized Pt. The mass activities of Au@AgPt HUSs under irradiation (200 mW cm−2) and dark conditions were calculated to be 3.26 and 2.64 A mgPt−1, which are 5.43- and 5.28-times those of commercial Pt black catalysts (0.6 and 0.5 A mgPt−1 for irradiation and dark conditions, respectively) (Fig. 3b), respectively. Absolute current amplification of Au@AgPt HUSs was 0.62 A mgPt−1, which is 2.82- and 9.54-times that of Au@Pt HUSs (0.22 A mgPt−1) and commercial Pt black (0.065 A mgPt−1), respectively. The increased current density ratio can be defined as Δj/j0. Herein, Δj and j0 were the enhanced current density and the current density acquired in dark conditions, respectively. The Δj/j0 value of Au@AgPt HUSs was calculated as 23.5%, which is higher than that of Au@Pt HUSs (10.81%) and Pt black (12.7%). Generally, a higher If/Ib ratio (n) represents a relatively complete oxidation of methanol, producing fewer poisoning species. As shown in Fig. 3c, If/Ib values of 2.08 and 2.37 were obtained for Au@AgPt HUSs under irradiation (200 mW cm−2, nIR) and dark conditions (nDC), respectively, which are clearly higher than those of Au@Pt HUSs (nIR = 1.33, nDC = 1.35) and commercial Pt black catalysts (nIR = 1.69, nDC = 1.84), respectively. The higher CO anti-poisoning ability of Au@AgPt HUSs compared with Au@Pt HUSs and pure Pt black can be attributed to the introduction of Ag species.

Amperometric i–t curves were recorded in a mixture solution containing 0.5 M NaOH and 1.0 M methanol while fixing the potential at −0.25 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) (Fig. 3d). Obviously, all catalysts showed a decreased oxidation current density, which can be attributed to the adsorption of poisoning intermediates, such as CO, on the exposed Pt. The plasmon effects on the catalytic performance of the as-prepared samples were quantitatively investigated by measuring the photo-induced current fluctuation during the MOR process after stabilizing in dark conditions for 500 s. As shown in Fig. 3d and Table S4,† the higher MOR current density and more rapid photocurrent response rate of Au@AgPt HUSs demonstrated their superior MOR reaction kinetics and robust light responsiveness compared with Au@Pt HUSs and commercial Pt black. As shown in Fig. S4,† the synergistic effect of the Au–Pt interaction in promoting MOR can be summarized by considering that Au acted as the light absorber and plasmon donor, while Pt served as the catalytic active site (more details in the ESI†).
As is well known, surface plasmons occur in the means of the collective oscillation of surface valence electrons of plasmonic metals triggered by the electric field of the incident light.40
The localized electric field in the metals then forms, accompanying the surface plasmons. When the frequency of the incident light matches the inherent plasmon frequency, resonance will occur, and then the plasmon energy will relax through radiative or nonradiative decay. In reality, the radiative decay results in light scattering by emitting photons. For the nonradiative decay, the plasmon oscillation is dephased and damped with the excitation of electronic interband and intraband transitions in the substrate, which generates hot electron–hole pairs (excited carriers). Next, the excited carriers thermalize by means of electron–electron scattering, electron–phonon cooling, and phonon–phonon scattering, subsequently.16 Finally, a thermal equilibrium is reached between the lattice and the surrounding medium. This phenomenon is defined as a photothermal effect. LSPR effects can be analyzed into the photothermal effect, hot carriers effect (hot electrons and hot holes), and localized electric field effect.40 To understand the underlying mechanism of the enhanced MOR induced by LSPR effects, it is critical to elucidate the actual roles of these three factors in boosting MOR performance under irradiation. Herein, a series of photothermal experiments of as-prepared samples in the electrolyte were first designed and performed. The IR camera was used to monitor the temperature changes of the Au@AgPt HUSs, Au@Pt HUSs, Pt black, and bare glass slide in the electrolyte under photoirradiation.41 The glass slide was used as a sample substrate and reference (see Fig. S5a–d† for details). As shown in Fig. S6,† the temperature of Au@AgPt HUSs increased from 25.3 to 43.8 °C within 235 s under irradiation (200 mW cm−2), which was also faster than that of Au@Pt HUSs (25.7 °C, 40.3 °C) and Pt black (26.7 °C, 35.8 °C) in electrolyte media. In contrast, temperature fluctuation curves of the bare glass slide in electrolyte media exhibited only a slight change. The rapidly increased temperature of Au@AgPt HUSs can be ascribed to the energy exchange between the energetic electron–hole pairs, which resulted from the oscillating resonance of surface valence electrons and the phonon modes. By combining the IR images (Fig. S5e–l†), the increase in local temperature of all catalysts can be ascribed to the photothermal process triggered by LSPR effects of the Au and Ag species. As reported in the temperature-dependent MOR experiments performed on the AgPt bimetallic hollow nanoparticles with ultra-thin shell systems, the increased temperature can accelerate the reaction kinetics of MOR but weaken the CO anti-poisoning capability of the catalysts.29 Therefore, it can be deduced that the MOR reaction kinetics were accelerated because of the increased localized temperature caused by the favorable photothermal property of Au@AgPt HUSs.
FDTD calculations were used to evaluate the local electric field distribution and electrons transfer of Au HUSs, Au@Pt HUSs, and Au@AgPt HUSs under planar linearly polarized light illumination with an excitation wavelength of 1100 nm, which stemmed from the experimental and simulated UV-vis absorption spectrum of Au@AgPt HUSs and Au HUSs (Fig. S7†). UV-vis absorption spectra indicated that Au@AgPt HUSs exhibited a higher light absorption capacity in the NIR region. Moreover, the trace deposition of Ag and Pt on the surface of Au HUSs minimally affects its light absorption. Simulated cross-sections and spectra demonstrated that the absorption occurring at the IR wavelength region (ca. 1100 nm) of Au@AgPt HUSs was stronger than that of Au@Ag HUSs and Au HUSs, as shown in Fig. S8.† |E| and |Eo| were designated to the enhanced electric field and incident electric field, respectively. Generally, the stronger the electronic field (|E|/|Eo|), the more hot carriers will be generated in plasmonic metal NPs from the ground state to the high-energy state.42,43Fig. 4a–c shows schematic models of Au HUSs, Au@Pt HUSs, and Au@AgPt HUSs constructed in FDTD calculations. It is clear that all Au HUSs, Au@AgPt HUSs, and Au@Pt HUSs exhibit equivalent localized electric fields and hot spots at the excitation wavelength of 1100 nm, as shown in Fig. 4d, e, g and h, revealing that the excellent LSPR features of the substrate (Au HUSs) were fully inherited by Au@AgPt HUSs and Au@Pt HUSs. It could be inferred that a periodical oscillation of electrons and holes in Pt species in Au@AgPt HUSs would occur owing to the definite LSPR effect of Au and Au@Ag substrate (Fig. 4d, g and S9†). Therefore, LSPR effects caused by the plasmonic metal Ag and Au led to an enhanced surface charge heterogeneity of Au@AgPt HUSs, resulting in a considerable decrease in the d-band center of Pt in Au@AgPt HUSs, which can downshift the adsorption energy of the intermediate in the MOR process.44

Simulation models of (a) Au HUSs, (b) Au@Pt HUSs, and (c) Au@AgPt HUSs; spatial localized electric field in log mode in XY plane of (d) Au HUSs, (e) Au@Pt HUSs, and (f) Au@AgPt HUSs with an excited wavelength 1100 nm; spatial localized electric field in log mode in XZ plane of (g) Au HUSs, (h) Au@Pt HUSs, and (i) Au@AgPt HUSs with an excited wavelength 1100 nm. Note that K and E denote the wave vector (purple ⊗ and arrow) and the vector of the electric field (blue arrow), respectively. 
It has been demonstrated that the LSPR effect of Au@AgPt HUSs mainly occurred at their tips (Fig. 4d–h), while the facet (111) was the main exposed crystal plane appearing at the tip of Au@AgPt HUSs (Fig. 1c). Therefore, taking Au@AgPt(111) and Au@Pt(111) planes as targeted facets, the reasonable reaction paths were calculated via the DFT calculations (VASP) to shed light on the intrinsic mechanism of enhanced MOR performance. The energy profiles of the proposed reaction mechanisms were evaluated and are shown in Fig. 5. Specifically, the *COH absorbed on the hollow Pt site is represented as *COH-h, and the *CO absorbed on the hollow and top site is annotated as *CO-h and *CO-t, respectively. Except for the *COH and *CO, other intermediates do not have a special annotation, although they were all adsorbed on the top sites. In detail, the higher energy barrier proceeding from *CH3OH to *CH3O compared with that proceeding from *CH3OH to *CH2OH, *CH3O was not a favorable intermediate in the MOR catalyst process. For the same reason, intermediate *CHOH was more suitable than *CH2O in the following reaction process. Subsequently, two alternative reaction pathways (i.e., *CHOH to *CHO or *CHOH to *COH) were calculated when the reaction proceeded from *CHOH. In the reaction pathway of *CHO (*CHO → *CO-t → *COOH), a low barrier (ca. 0.57 eV) was obtained to drive the MOR process. However, because of the much lower free energy of *COH-h than *CHOH relative to *CHO, *COH-h could be acquired much favorably than *CHO. With the dissociation of O–H bonding on *COH-h, the *CO intermediate was produced on the hollow site spontaneously instead of on the top site (as shown in Fig. 5a and b). Therefore, in the reaction *COH-h → *CO-h → *COOH, the higher barrier (∼1.2 eV) from *CO-h to *COOH hindered the reaction. Thus, two possible reaction pathways could be obtained as follows: the favorable reaction pathway was concluded as CH3OH(aq) → *CH3OH → *CH2OH → *CHOH → *COH-h → *CO-h → *COOH → *CO2, which was annotated as route 1. Meanwhile, the alternative reaction pathway (i.e., CH3OH(aq) → *CH3OH → *CH2OH → *CHOH → *CHO → *CO-t → *COOH → *CO2) was annotated as route 2. In these reaction paths, the formation of the *COOH from *CO-h was the rate-determining step due to the larger energy barrier for the Au@AgPt(111) and Au@Pt(111) catalysts.

As shown in Fig. 5c, although the rate-determining step barrier on Au@AgPt(111) (ΔE = 1.21 eV) approached that of Au@Pt(111) (ΔE = 1.18 eV) in the reaction pathway route 1, the poisoning of CO on Au@AgPt(111) weakened 0.2 eV by the Ag interlayer between Pt and Au. However, DFT calculations indicated that the desorption of *CO-h on the Au@AgPt(111) (2.05 eV) and Au@Pt(111) (2.22 eV) was lower than that of Pt(111) (2.70 eV) when the energy of *CO-h is referenced to a CO gas molecule.45 The strong adsorption of *CO on the Pt surface resulted in CO poisoning on hollow Pt sites, which severely hindered the reaction kinetics of MOR. It was further demonstrated that the intermediate *CO can be activated under irradiation in CO stripping experiments (see Fig. S11 in the ESI†). The CO coverage ratio on Au@AgPt HUSs was decreased evidently compared with that of Au HUSs and Pt black, respectively, implying that the intermediate *CO can be activated by the energetic hot carriers stemming from the LSPR effect of the Au@AgPt HUSs under constant irradiation. Therefore, we propose herein an approach to release CO poisoning on the Au@AgPt(111) and highlight the hot carriers of LSPR effect on the enhanced MOR performance. Generally, the interaction between the Pt surface and CO makes the electron transfer to the CO molecule,46 while on the Au@AgPt surface, the excited hot holes induced by visible light may inject into the CO molecule, followed by weakening the adsorption of CO on the Au@AgPt(111) catalyst;45 thus releasing the CO poisoning of the catalyst. In addition, the effect of the localized electric fields on the conversion of CO over the Au@AgPt catalysts was analyzed using Gaussian calculations,47 in which the MO behavior of a CO molecule in the presence of uniform electric fields was calculated as shown in Fig. S12.† The calculated results showed that the energy of MOs predictably decreased as the external electric field increased. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level decreased considerably more than that of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) (Fig. S13,† left). The HOMO–LUMO bandgap of the CO molecule tended to decrease evidently with increased external electric field (Fig. S13,† right). When the applied electric field value increased to 0.1 Hartree/Bohr (5.2 V Å−1), the bandgap of the CO molecule decreased by 15.4% compared with that of the initial state (without electric field). The reduced HOMO–LUMO bandgap facilitated the electron transfer of the CO molecule in the MO energy level, which was conducive to its activation.40,48 With the energy level in the CO molecule downshifted, the electron contained in the hydroxyl ion transferred to the LUMO level of CO molecule easily, and was followed by transfer to the catalytic substrate from the HOMO energy level of the CO molecule. The MOs of a molecule under an external electric field showed similar characteristics, irrespective of whether the electrode exists.49 Thus, the adsorbed CO molecule could react with the OH− more easily under the localized electric field versus without the external field, thus improving the catalytic performance. In total, based on the results of the FDTD simulation and DFT calculations, the LSPR effect promotes the MOR performance of Au@Pt, enhanced due to the hot carriers induced by the visible light. By introducing Ag into the Au@Pt catalyst to form Au@AgPt, the d-band center of Pt downshifted and further improved the catalytic activity on the MOR.44 Furthermore, the rate-determining step reaction could be boosted via two strategies which were ascribed to LSPR effects. One was that the weakened adsorption of *CO resulted in the *CO transferring from the *CO-h site to the *CO-t site, which was energized by hot carriers. The other was that the downshifted LUMO energy level of CO facilitated the process of *CO to *COOH due to the localized electric field. Consequently, with occupied Pt active sites being released for MOR and the rate-determining step *CO to *COOH being accelerated, the MOR reaction kinetics of Au@AgPt HUSs were dramatically improved.
4. Conclusions
In summary, Au@AgPt HUSs was successfully synthesized by a modified wet chemical method. Dramatically enhanced MOR performance was achieved on the unique Au@AgPt hollow urchin-like structure under light irradiation due to its LSPR effect. The instinct mechanisms toward enhanced MOR were systematically studied by conducting a series of photothermal experiments and theoretical simulations, such as FDTD and DFT calculations. In short, due to the localized heating resulting from the photothermal effect under irradiation, the reaction kinetics of MOR over Au@AgPt HUSs were dramatically accelerated. Furthermore, the Ag species in Au@AgPt HUSs can downshift the d-band center of the surface Pt species on Au@AgPt HUSs, thus leading to its superior MOR kinetics compared with that of Au@Pt HUSs. Moreover, the rate-determining step *CO-h to *COOH was accelerated due to the reduced LUMO energy level of CO, which was induced by the localized electric field. In addition, the energetic hot carriers in Au@AgPt HUSs can endow energy to promote the *CO transfer from the *CO-h site to the *CO-t site, resulting in the reactivation of poisoned Pt hollow active sites. Thus, more available active sites can be utilized to accelerate the reaction kinetics. This work investigated the mechanism of LSPR-improved catalysis and provided a promising way to boost conventional catalysis by introducing solar energy flux.
