    , Accepted 3rd October 2019First published on 8th October 2019AbstractThe rational construction of the chemical composition and morphological structure of electrocatalysts has been considered as the key to their electrochemical performance and energy storage. Herein, we report the facile fabrication of the hierarchical Ni2P–Co2P–Fe2P hybrid hollow nanoprism (abbreviated as NiCoFeP-HN), which could efficiently work as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst in the rechargeable Zn–air battery. NiCoFeP-HN was synthesized via an in situ ion exchange reaction of nickel–cobalt precursors with [Fe(CN)6]3− at room temperature and the subsequent phosphorization at 300 °C under N2. The ion exchange procedure was crucial for preserving the nanoprism morphology and enhancing the OER performance. NiCoFeP-HN exhibited satisfactory activity with a small overpotential of 294 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and remarkable stability for over 12 h. Compared to the conventional RuO2 + Pt/C Zn–air battery, the NiCoFeP-HN + Pt/C based Zn–air battery has exhibited superior energy density and much better cycling stability. This work presents a facile and efficient avenue for the construction of hollow nanostructures and hybrid compositions, and provides a promising candidate with good electrochemical performance and energy storage.
1. Introduction
The electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has drawn extensive research interest due to its critical role in energy generation and conversion, such as in solar cells and metal–air batteries.1–4 However, the energy conversion efficiency is hampered by the high overpotential and sluggish kinetics of the OER, which has driven the development of efficient catalysts.5–9 Currently, noble metal-based materials, such as IrO2 and RuO2, are identified as the best OER catalysts, but the prohibitive cost and scarcity hinders their practical applications.10–13 Thus, the design and exploration of low-cost catalysts with high-efficiency OER performance is urgent.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered as ideal precursors for the preparation of energy materials14–17 due to their highly ordered structures, fine-tunable metal centers and large surface area. Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs) are the most representative MOFs18–20 and can be converted into the corresponding oxides,21,22 selenides,23 sulfides24,25 and phosphides26 by a facile thermal treatment, which have been widely used in the area of the electrochemical catalysis and energy storage. For instance, Lou and co-workers reported Ni–Co mixed oxide cages derived from Ni–Co PBA cages, with high electrocatalytic activity and excellent stability for OER and an overpotential of 380 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2.27 The Ni2P/Fe2P arrays grown on a titanium foil derived from Ni-PBA nanocubes by Shen et al. manifested high OER activities due to the ordered morphology and various metal sites.22 Fe-doped CoP, derived from Co-PBA nanocubes, has indicated high stability for both OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solutions.23
According to previous experience, multi-component hybrid structures could enhance the OER performance as compared to their single-component counterparts due to the unique inter-structural interaction and electron transfer between the different interfaces.22,28–30 Moreover, the morphologies and structures of catalysts are also critical to electrochemical performance.24 Compared to the solid structure, nanostructures with hollow and hierarchical structures could promote their OER performances by boosting the charge transfer and facilitating diffusion efficiency, owing to the advantages of larger active surface areas and low density. However, the synthesis of hollow nanostructures with fascinating compositions and morphologies are still a significant challenge to chemists.25,31
In this work, we demonstrate the facile fabrication of a hierarchical Ni2P–Co2P–Fe2P hollow nanoprism (abbreviated as NiCoFeP-HN) via an in situ ion exchange reaction of nickel-cobalt precursors with K3[Fe(CN)6] and phosphorization treatment at 300 °C under N2. The prepared NiCoFeP-HN hollow nanoprisms exhibited satisfactory activity with a small overpotential of 294 mV at 10 mA cm−2. To explore the applications of the NiCoFeP-HN catalyst, a home-made Zn–air battery with the NiCoFeP-HN + Pt/C mixture as the air–cathode was built, which exhibited high energy density, excellent cycling stability and superior performance as compared to the conventional RuO2 + Pt/C based Zn–air battery. This study provides a novel strategy for the syntheses of hollow nanostructure catalysts and their applications as OER electrocatalysts and in the rechargeable Zn–air battery.
2. Experimental section
All the reagents were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Factory and utilized as received without further purification.
2.1. Synthesis of the Ni–Co precursor
The Ni–Co precursors were synthesized according to a previously reported method with some modifications.31 In a typical synthesis process, 0.86 g (3.46 mmol) nickel acetate tetrahydrate, 0.43 g (1.73 mmol) cobalt acetate tetrahydrate and 3.0 g PVP (MW ≈ 58 K) were dissolved in 200 mL of ethanol with the assistance of sonication for 20 min. The solution was then heated to 85 °C under refluxing conditions for 4 h. The product was collected by centrifugation, and washed with ethanol at least three times and dried in an oven at 50 °C for 10 h.
2.2. Synthesis of NiCoFe-PBA-HN
A 1:1 mixed ethanol and H2O solution (40 mL) of K3[Fe(CN)6] (40 mg, 0.121 mmol) was added dropwise to the clear ethanol solution of the Ni–Co precursor (40 mg, 5 mL). After continuous stirring for another 10 min, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed three times with deionized water and ethanol, and dried in the oven at 50 °C for 10 h.
2.3. Synthesis of NiCoFeP-HN
NiCoFe-PBA (20 mg) and NaH2PO2 (400 mg, 3.77 mmol) were placed in two separate positions in a porcelain boat inside a tube furnace with NaH2PO2 at the upstream side of the N2 gas flow. The tube furnace was then heated to 300 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1, and maintained at this temperature for 2 h under N2. After naturally cooling to room temperature, the resulting NiCoFeP-HN was collected.
2.4. Synthesis of NiCoP-NP nanoparticles
NiCoP-NP nanoparticles were synthesized using the same phosphorization conditions as NiCoFeP-HN, where NiCoP-NP was obtained from the phosphorization of the obtained Ni–Co precursors without the ion exchange procedure.
2.5. Characterizations
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was carried out on a Model D/max-rC X-ray diffractometer using a Cu Kα radiation source. The morphology and structure of the as-prepared samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800 scanning) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010F). The chemical states of the as-prepared samples were acquired on a Thermo VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 spectrometer using Al Kα X-ray as the excitation source. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area was measured using N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, and was performed on the Micromeritics ASAP 2050 instrument.
2.6. Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical experiments were performed on a CHI 660 electrochemical workstation in a typical three-electrode system using a glassy carbon electrode (3 mm diameter), carbon rod and saturated calomel electrode as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The 1.0 M KOH solution was used as the electrolyte, which was purified with O2 for 30 min before the OER test. The catalytic ink was made by combining 5 mg of catalyst, 0.95 mL of water and anhydrous ethanol (v/v ∼ 3:1), and 50 μL of Nafion solution with the assistance of sonication for at least 30 min. Next, 20 μL of the resulting suspension was dropped on the surfaces of the glassy carbon electrode and dried at room temperature. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, and corrected by iR-compensation. The potentials were referenced to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE): E(RHE) = E(SCE) + 0.0591pH + 0.242 V. The overpotentials (η) were calculated as follows: η = E(vs. RHE) − 1.23. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed with a frequency ranging from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz and an AC voltage with 5 mV amplitude.
2.7. Zinc–air battery test
For the rechargeable zinc–air battery tests, a mixed solution of 0.2 M ZnCl2 + 6 M KOH was used as the electrolyte, a Zn plate (thickness of 0.3 mm) was used as the anode, carbon paper loaded with the catalyst was employed as the air–cathode (a mass loading of 10 mg cm−2). The cycling test was performed with a Land CT2001A system at a current density of 5 mA cm−2. As a control, the Zn–air battery with mixed Pt/C and RuO2 (mass ratio of 1:1) was also tested.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Material design with structural and compositional analysis
The preparation strategy of NiCoFeP-HN is illustrated in Scheme 1. Uniform Ni–Co precursor was employed as the template, which was synthesized according to the reflux condensation method with an average size of 1.0 μm in length and 500 nm in width and the double-capped tetragonal antiprism morphology with smooth surface (Fig. S1, ESI†). Powder XRD (PXRD) patterns of the resulting Ni–Co precursor were highly consistent with the standard patterns (JCPDS no. 22-0582, Fig. S2a, ESI†), which correspond to the tetragonal Ni–Co acetate hydroxide phase ((Ni,Co)5(OH)2(CH3COO)8·2H2O).32

NiCoFe-PBA-HN was then obtained from the facile ion-exchange strategy of the Ni–Co precursor with K3[Fe(CN)6]. The released Ni2+ and Co2+ ions from the Ni–Co precursor could react with [Fe(CN)6]3− in the water/ethanol solvent and the hierarchical construction of NiCoFe-PBA could be deposited on the surface of the Ni–Co precursor to form the external shell. With the further dissolution of the internal Ni–Co precursor, the resulting hollow structure of NiCoFe-PBA-HN was formed.33 The nanoprism morphology was preserved as Ni–Co precursors, however, a unique hollow structure with a large interior cavity in NiCoFe-PBA-HN and rough surface were observed (Fig. 1a and b). The hollow structure of NiCoFe-PBA-HN was defined with a uniform shell thickness of 80 nm (Fig. 1a and b). PXRD patterns revealed the successful synthesis of NiCoFe-PBA-HN, which closely matched the standard patterns (JCPDS no. 75-0039, Fig. S2b, ESI†).34

Phosphorization of NiCoFe-PBA-HN with NaH2PO2 at 300 °C under N2 atmosphere was carried out and the final product NiCoFeP-HN was obtained. SEM images show that the resulting NiCoFeP-HN maintained the hollow structural nanoprism morphology, like NiCoFe-PBA-HN, without any shell breakage (Fig. 1c). NiCoFeP-HN was further analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). In the EDS profile of NiCoFeP-HN (Fig. 1d), clear peaks of Ni, Co, Fe and P confirmed the successful phosphorization of NiCoFe-PBA-HN. Quantitative analysis from EDS revealed the presence of 6.10% Ni, 4.43% Co, 4.42% Fe and 85.05% P in NiCoFeP-HN.
PXRD patterns have indicated that NiCoFeP-HN is a mixture of the Ni2P phase (JCPDS no. 03-0953), Co2P phase (JCPDS no. 54-0413) and Fe2P phase (JCPDS no. 27-1171) (Fig. S2c, ESI†). The diffraction peaks at 47.3° and 54.9° could be indexed to the (210) and (211) planes of Ni2P phase (JCPDS no. 03-0953).35 The dominant peaks at 48.4° and 55.5° were attributed to the (120) and (030) planes of the Co2P phase (JCPDS no. 54-0413).36 The prominent peaks at 17.4°, 25.7°, 30.4°,31.26°, 35.3°, 40.28°, 44.18° and 54.6° were assigned to the (100), (001), (110), (101), (200), (201) and (211) planes of Fe2P (JCPDS no. 27-1171).37 The conversion from NiCoFe-PBA-HN to NiCoFeP-HN was complete, as evidenced by the disappearance of the diffraction patterns of NiCoFe-PBA-HN in the PXRD of NiCoFeP-HN. The as-prepared samples were further investigated using FT-IR spectroscopy in order to demonstrate the successful transformation (Fig. S3, ESI†). In the FT-IR spectrum of NiCoFe-PBA-HN, the peaks located at 3413 and 1602 cm−1 are due to the stretching vibrations of the –OH ions or the absorbed H2O molecules, while the peak at 2098 cm−1 is attributed to the characteristic –CN stretching.38 The absence of the characteristic –CN stretching for NiCoFeP-HN indicates the full conversion of NiCoFe-PBA-HN to NiCoFeP-HN.39 TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) were also used to investigate the detailed morphology and hierarchical structure of NiCoFeP-HN (Fig. 2). The TEM images further identified the hollow structure of NiCoFeP-HN (Fig. 2a). The HRTEM image (Fig. 2b) indicated that the surface was composed of nanoparticles, which led to the roughness of the surface and was in accordance with the SEM results and also confirmed the crystalline nature of NiCoFeP-HN. The lattice fringes are indicated in Fig. 2c. Inter-planar spacings of 0.218 nm, 0.179 nm and 0.369 nm correspond to the (111) plane of the Ni2P, the (110) plane of the Co2P and the (221) lattice plane of Fe2P, respectively. The elemental mapping of a single NiCoFeP-HN showed that the Ni, Co, Fe and P elements were evenly distributed in the nanoprism (Fig. 2d–g). The EDX-line scanning profile (Fig. S4, ESI†) further demonstrated the hollow structure and even distribution of Ni, Co, Fe and P elements.

The surface composition and chemical states of NiCoFeP-HN were further characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).40,41 The full XPS spectrum of NiCoFeP-HN revealed the existence of the expected Ni 2p, Co 2p, Fe 2p and P 2p signals (Fig. S5, ESI†). In the high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. 3a), each Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 spectrum has two dominant peaks and one satellite peak. The predominant peaks located at 852.8 and 870.1 eV can be assigned to the metallic state of Ni, while the peaks centered at 816.6 and 880.1 eV could be attributed to the satellite peaks, and the peaks at 856.1 eV and 874.2 eV could be assigned to the Ni2+ oxidation state.36,42–44 Similarly, the Co 2p peaks observed at 778.2 and 793.1 eV could be indexed to the Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 of Co species in Co–P. The peaks at 781.3 and 797.5 eV were assigned to the CoOx species. The satellite peaks of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 were located at 785.2 and 803.2 eV, respectively (Fig. 3b).45–47 In Fig. 3c, the predominant peaks at 709.9 and 724.3 eV correspond to Fe2+ 2p3/2 and Fe2+ 2p1/2, respectively, while the peaks at 712.6 and 725.4 eV could be ascribed to Fe3+, and the main peak at 720.7 eV can be assigned to the satellite peak.48,49 The high-resolution P 2p spectrum exhibited three main peaks, where the peaks at 128.9 and 129.8 eV correspond to P 2p3/2 and P 2p1/2, respectively. The peak at 133.5 eV could be indexed to the P–O due to the exposure to air (Fig. 3d).50 The XPS analysis was consistent with the PXRD results, where NiCoFeP-HN was composed of Ni2P–Co2P–Fe2P.

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas and pore size distribution for the as-prepared NiCoFeP-HN were also investigated by the N2 adsorption–desorption experiment. According to the adsorption–desorption curves (Fig. S6, ESI†), NiCoFeP-HN displayed a type II isotherm with an H1 type hysteresis loop, which is a typical characteristic of aggregation of uniform small particles.51 NiCoFeP-HN had a high BET surface area of 378.7 m2 g−1 with a mean pore diameter of 7.7 nm. The hollow structure of NiCoFeP-HN would not only promote electron transfer, but also facilitate the OER reactions.
In contrast, NiCoP-NP nanoparticles were also prepared, which were synthesized from the direct phosphorization of Ni–Co precursors under the same reaction conditions as NiCoFeP-HN. The nanoprism morphology of Ni–Co precursors collapsed during the phosphorization, which led to the irregular morphological nanoparticles of NiCoP-NP (Fig. S7a, ESI†). PXRD patterns indicated the co-existence of two crystalline phases of the Ni2P phase (JCPDS no. 03-0953) and the Co2P phase (JCPDS no. 54-0413) in NiCoP-NP (Fig. S7b, ESI†). The results suggest that the ion exchange reaction of the hollow structure was critical for the maintenance of the nanoprism morphology. Single-component Fe2P, CoP or Ni2P catalysts were also prepared according to previous reports for comparison (Fig. S8a, ESI†).33–35,37,52
3.2 OER catalytic performance evaluation
The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated NiCoFeP-HN for OER was investigated in 1 M KOH solution with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 using a standard three-electrode system (Fig. 4).53 As comparison, NiCoP-NP, single-component Fe2P, CoP, Ni2P and commercial RuO2 were also investigated under the same conditions. The iR-corrected linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves (Fig. 4a and S8b, ESI†) indicated that NiCoFeP-HN exhibited the lowest overpotential of 294 mV at 10 mA cm−2, which was much smaller than those of NiCoP-NP (362 mV), Ni2P (386 mV), CoP (365 mV) and Fe2P (390 mV) and the commercial RuO2 catalyst (330 mV). These results indicate that the resulted composite NiCoFeP-HN has shown the best electronic transmission capacity as compared to the NiCoP-NP and commercial RuO2. Compared to the reported overpotential of the single-component CoP (400 mV)54 and dual-composition Ni2P/CoP (320 mV),55 the introduction of Fe element significantly enhanced the electronic transfer capacity of NiCoFeP-HN (Table S1†). Another previously reported NiCoFeP/C catalysts exhibited an overpotenitial of 270 mV for OER at 10 mA cm−2, but the synthetic procedure was under much stricter reaction conditions than that of NiCoFeP-HN, which underwent solvothermal synthesis at 140 °C and phosphorization at 300 °C.56 To further measure the OER kinetics, the Tafel plots of the as-prepared samples were obtained and are shown in Fig. 4b. The Tafel slope value of NiCoFeP-HN is 50.5 mV dec−1, indicating that the rate-determining step could be the chemical step (i.e., M–OH M–O− + H+), while the Tafel slope value of NiCoP-NP is 103.2 mV dec−1, suggesting that the rate-determining step could be the electron transfer step.57 The results suggest that NiCoFeP-HN has higher intrinsic OER kinetics and faster oxygen evolution. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was further utilized to understand the electrocatalytic kinetics and interfacial resistance (Fig. 4c). The Nyquist plot of NiCoFeP-HN showed that NiCoFeP-HN had a smaller charge-transfer resistance than NiCoP-NP, which suggested the faster electron and mass transfer rates of the NiCoFeP-HN. Thus, the electrocatalytic activity of the NiCoFeP-HN catalyst was found to be superior to that of RuO2 and NiCoP-NP.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) with different scan rates in the range of 20–100 mV s−1 of the NiCoFeP-HN and NiCoP-NP catalysts (Fig. S9, ESI†) was conducted and the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was also evaluated by using double-layer capacitance (Cdl) (Fig. 4d). The Cdl of the NiCoFeP-HN catalyst (26.7 mF cm−2) was much higher than that of the NiCoP-NP catalyst (4.6 mF cm−2), indicating more exposed catalytically active sites of the NiCoFeP-HN catalyst for the OER process. The Cdl of the NiCoFeP-HN catalyst was also much larger than those of the reported FexP (17.7 mF cm−2) and Ni2P (3.4 mF cm−2).58 The promising ECSA for the NiCoFeP-HN catalyst could benefit from the hierarchical hollow nanoprism structure, which could enhance the anion exchange between the electrolyte and the catalytically active sites.59
To investigate the electrochemical stability of the NiCoFeP-HN catalyst for the OER performance, CV and chronoamperometry experiments were conducted. The OER LSV polarization curve for the NiCoFeP-HN catalyst after 1000 cycles of testing indicated minor differences from the initial one and the chronopotentiometric (CP) curve also exhibited only a slight decay after continuous testing for 12 h in an alkaline environment, which suggested no obvious degradation and excellent stability of the NiCoFeP-HN catalyst (Fig. 4e and f). In the high-resolution XPS spectra of the post-OER NiCoFeP-HN catalyst (Fig. S10, ESI†), the negative shift of the main peaks and the weakened shoulders were observed as compared with the original states of Ni2+, Co2+ and Fe2+, respectively, which signified the transformation of the original Ni2+, Co2+ and Fe2+ states to the higher oxidation states, and that the surface of the NiCoFeP-HN catalyst was transformed from the metal phosphide to the corresponding metal oxides/hydroxides during the OER process.60,61 This transformation on the surface would have a positive influence on the OER performance and would remarkably enhance the durability of the NiCoFeP-HN catalyst in alkaline medium.62 In contrast to the P 2p spectrum of the initial NiCoFeP-HN, the peak for the phosphide components at 128.9 and 129.8 eV (Fig. 3d) completely disappeared after the OER process and only an individual peak located at 133.1 eV has been defined, which further confirmed the existence of the transformation of the metal phosphide to the corresponding metal oxides/hydroxides (Fig. S10, ESI†).62 The free oxygen reacted with the NiCoFeP-HN catalyst to form the oxidized phosphorus species (PxOy) on the surfaces of NiCoFe oxides. The oxidation layers exposed more active sites to be in close contact with electrolyte and promoted the transport of reactants and products, which improved the utilization efficiency of the catalytic activity sites. Furthermore, the strong electronic interactions between oxidation layers and NiCoFeP-HN could also improve the electrocatalytic activity.63,64
The boosted OER performance may be attributed to the unique hollow nanoprism structure and the introduction of Fe element. The post-synthetic ion exchange reaction was demonstrated to be crucial to preserving the hollow nanoprism nanostructure. The hollow structure could expose larger surface areas and provide more active sites; the synergistic interface of multi-component metal phosphides (Ni2P–Co2P–Fe2P) could also promote the multi-electron transfer.65,66 Thus, the introduction of Fe element into NiCoP could significantly boost the conductivity of the electrocatalyst and the synergistic effect between the Ni, Co and Fe sites for OER performance.67,68
To evaluate the practicability of the NiCoFeP-HN catalyst, a home-made Zn–air battery was built, where the NiCoFeP-HN + Pt/C mixture (mass ratio, 1:1) served as the air–cathode, as illustrated in Fig. 5a.69–71 In the Zn–air battery, the cell contained 0.2 M ZnCl2 + 6.0 M KOH mixed solution as the electrolyte, the carbon paper supported the NiCoFeP-HN + Pt/C catalyst as the air–cathode, and a Zn plate (thickness of 0.3 mm) was the anode. The conventional Zn–air battery with the RuO2 + Pt/C catalyst (mass ratio = 1:1) as the air cathode was also tested as the reference. The Zn–air battery equipped with the NiCoFeP-HN + Pt/C catalyst worked smoothly with a steady open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.41 V for 1000 s (Fig. 5b) and a red light-emitting diode (LED) could be powered up by two Zn–air batteries in series with the NiCoFeP-HN + Pt/C catalyst as the air–cathode (Fig. S11, ESI†). This suggests that the Zn–air battery with the NiCoFeP-HN + Pt/C catalyst has a high power/energy density. The NiCoFeP-HN + Pt/C based battery exhibited a maximum power density of 109 mW cm−2, which is close to that of the RuO2 + Pt/C-based battery (128 mW cm−2) (Fig. S12, ESI†). At a current density of 5 mA cm−2, the specific density of the NiCoFeP-HN + Pt/C-based Zn–air battery could be up to 754 mA h gZn−1 (Fig. 5c) corresponding to an energy density of 966 W h kgZn−1, which showed superiority to the conventional RuO2 + Pt/C-based Zn–air battery (691 mA h gZn−1; 864 W h kgZn−1). Furthermore, the cycling performance with an interval of 10 min discharge −10 min charge for the Zn–air battery at a current density of 5 mA cm−2 was also investigated, as depicted in Fig. 5d. The NiCoFeP-HN + Pt/C-based Zn–air battery could maintain over 280 continuous cycles (over 83 h) without any significant attenuation. For the 1st cycle, the voltaic efficiency of the NiCoFeP-HN + Pt/C-based Zn–air battery was 65.5%, and only slightly dropped to 56.2% after 300 cycles at 5 mA cm−2 (Fig. S10, ESI†), which indicated the excellent stability of the NiCoFeP-HN + Pt/C catalyst. However, the discharge voltage of the Zn–air battery based on the RuO2 + Pt/C catalyst dramatically dropped to less than 1.0 V after only 40 continuous cycles (∼13 h) and the voltaic efficiency was observed to decrease from 66.1% to 39.7% after 70 cycles (Fig. S10, ESI†), demonstrating the poor cycling stability. According to previous reports, the poor cycling life of the mixed RuO2 + Pt/C could be mainly due to the migration or aggregation of the active-particles caused by the continuous discharging and charging.72–75 Thus, the NiCoFeP-HN + Pt/C catalyst exhibited much better cycling stability than the RuO2 + Pt/C catalyst, which could practically be considered as a substitute for commercial RuO2.

4. Conclusion
In this work, we demonstrated the facile fabrication of the NiCoFeP-HN catalyst via the room-temperature Fe-incorporation and phosphorization treatment at 300 °C under N2, which indicated excellent performance for OER and in Zn–air batteries. The post-synthetic ion exchange reaction was demonstrated to be crucial for preserving the hollow nanoprism nanostructure and for enhancing the OER performance, where the existence of Fe element could efficiently facilitate the charge transfer. Due to the synergetic effect of the desired morphological structure and multicomponent metal phosphides, the as-prepared NiCoFeP-HN exhibited satisfactory activity with a small overpotential of 294 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and remarkable stability for over 12 h. Regarding a home-made rechargeable Zn–air battery, the NiCoFeP-HN + Pt/C-based battery exhibited superior performance and excellent cycling stability as compared to the conventional RuO2 + Pt/C-based battery. The developed approach provides a new viewpoint for the rational syntheses of hollow structures for applications as superior electrocatalysts and rechargeable Zn–air batteries.
