    , Accepted 14th September 2017First published on 19th September 2017AbstractSolar photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants is a promising cheap way for waste water disinfection. There are two weaknesses in the photocatalytic process: inadequate utilization of light energy and fast charge recombination. Effective surface–interface control over morphological tailoring can provide a large surface area, and prevent quick recombination of carriers, resulting in efficiency enhancement. In this work, we focus on enhancing the critical elemental photocatalytic steps via innovation in material chemistry. A diverse series of nanostructured ferroelectric Bi5FeTi3O15 with enhanced charge separation originating from their ferroelectric nature were synthesized by varying the pH value during the hydrothermal synthesis. Their photocatalytic properties can also be tailored to best fit the degradation of hazardous antibiotics (e.g. tetracycline) in aqueous solution, including light absorption in the solar spectrum, charge separation, structure and surface charge for effective mass transport. The photodegradation of tetracycline follows first-order kinetics, and a significantly enhanced photooxidation performance is observed for 3D flower-like Bi5FeTi3O15 with a degradation rate constant of 1.97 × 10−1 min−1, much faster than that reported in the literature for Fe-based visible light active photocatalysts towards tetracycline degradation. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the higher electron densities in [Bi3FeTi3O13]2− layers can favor the transport of photogenerated electrons and holes in alternate layers, promoting a longer charge carrier lifetime from 3.4 ns to 7.1 ns, as revealed by time-resolved photoluminescence spectra. The photodegradation mechanism is supported by theoretical calculation and experimentally identified by free radical and spin trapping experiments, LC-MS, and reduced total organic carbon analysis with approximately 94.88% removal, all of which testify to the complete mineralization of the antibiotics.
1. Introduction
Semiconductor-based photocatalysis has been recognized as a promising method to tackle the degradation of many organic pollutants due to its simplicity, economy, mild operation conditions and viability.1–3 The abuse of antibiotics has led to serious water contamination in many developing countries, and these antibiotics can irreversibly harm public health and the ecobalance.4,5 Therefore, decomposing these organic small molecules via low-cost and facile methods is particularly important in developing countries. Owing to its high chemical stability, environmentally-benign properties, low cost, and exceptional optical and electronic properties, TiO2 has so far been the most popular wideband gap (3.0–3.2 eV) photocatalyst.6 Energetically, the conduction band minimum (CBM = −0.29 eV) and valence band maximum (VBM = 2.91 eV) of TiO2 sufficiently straddle the LUMO of triplet O2 and the HOMO of OH−, allowing the formation of two key radicals for the photodegradation of organic pollutants: redox potentials of ˙O2−/O2 = −0.046 V, and redox potentials of ˙OH/OH− = 1.99 V.7–9 However, the practical applications of pristine TiO2 for the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants are hampered by its relatively large band gap, which make it responsive only in ultraviolet light, a less than 5% portion of the solar spectrum.6 Meanwhile, the fast charge recombination in pristine TiO2 causes a deterioration in the charge transport to the surface where degradation via surface electrochemistry occurs.10 As such, there is a strong desire to develop new photocatalysts with both appropriate band gaps to harvest visible light and mechanics for efficient carrier separation to utilize the photoelectronic energy. Doping with transition metals appears to expand the optical absorption, but often also leads to undesirable instability and a low quantum yield of photocatalytic reactions.11,12 In fact, photocatalytic reactions demand a charge separation in an oriented way to maximize the duration of electron–hole separation to match the kinetics of the desired subsequent surface reactions.
To tackle the above challenges, we borrow an idea from ferroelectric (FE) materials, in which the built-in electric field in FE materials can facilitate the oriented charge transfer in crossing the surface boundary, since the internal fields create charged surfaces, leading to oxidation and reduction reactions being formed at different locations.13 A remarkable example is the combination of Ti, Bi, Fe and oxides possessing photocatalytic, ferroelectric properties.14–16 The Bi-containing subunit can expand the visible light response due to the formation of an impure-induced dispersed valence band (Bi 6s and O 2p), which preferentially allows hole transport so as to induce a photooxidation reaction.16–19 The Fe-based subunit forms a ferroelectric structure to promote charge separation. The introduction of Fe into Ti-based oxides allows electron transfer between Ti4+/Ti3+, and hole transfer between Fe3+/Fe2+, hence improving the carrier separation to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency. Besides charge transport, a concerted mass transport is also needed. Therefore, surface engineering of the materials for better mass transport of reactive species (pollutants, O2etc.) should also improve the desired photooxidation reaction. With regard to all of these, we propose a rational 3D hierarchical perovskite Bi5FeTi3O15 nanostructure to simultaneously boost charge transport, mass transport, the interfacial active area, and species adsorption. In general, 3D hierarchical nanostructures require the use of templates and/or surfactants that inevitably introduce impurities.20,21 Despite much research effort, there is still a lack of a mild, one-step, time-saving synthetic method to obtain a 3D morphology. Contrary to widely reported observations, recent experimental evidence has provided a clue that the reaction environment significantly affects the microstructures and surface of photocatalysts.22,23
Herein, we aim to synthesize a 3D hierarchically nanostructured Bi5FeTi3O15 as an efficient photocatalyst for the degradation of organic pollutants using a hydrothermal method based on the following objectives: (i) selected perovskite Bi5FeTi3O15 containing [Bi2O2]2+ and [Bi3FeTi3O13]2− layers, as exhibited in Fig. 1. Based on its unique crystal structure, the octahedron would lead to enhanced photocatalytic activity due to the efficient charge transfer between metals (Ti4+/Fe3+). Meanwhile, these layered structures preferentially separate the electron transport in [Bi3FeTi3O13]2− and the hole transport in Bi–O layers, as our DFT study suggests. (ii) With elements Bi and Fe in the structure, the light absorption band edge is extended to the visible region with the formation of a hybridized valence band (O 2p + Bi 6s + Fe t2g), and these dispersed valence bands permit rapid hole transport to facilitate the photocatalytic reaction. (iii) Earth-abundant Fe-based compounds acquire a magnetic property, the introduction of which allows the convenient separation and re-collection of the materials. (iv) More significantly, variation of the reaction environment may affect the surface and band structure of the photocatalysts; a 3D flower-like morphology could enhance the surface area, and the number of interfacial active sites and provide favorable reactions.
 Fig. 1  Structure of aurivillius layered perovskite Bi5FeTi3O15 (ICSD No. 51862) shows alternate stacks of [Bi2O2]2+ and [Bi3FeTi3O13]2− units along the b direction. 
In this work, we have developed a surfactant-free synthesis of nanostructured hierarchical Bi5FeTi3O15 with diverse morphologies by only tuning the pH values during hydrothermal synthesis. The resulting nanostructured Bi5FeTi3O15 samples exhibit visible light-driven photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline (a widely overused antibiotic) with an efficiency of 99.34% degradation and 94.88% of total organic carbon (TOC) removal. In terms of the basic chemistry of materials, we also extensively investigated the molecular-level pathway of tetracycline based on trapping experiments, and all the intermediates have been analyzed by LC-MS and TOC. Our approach can be evaluated as a general route for the design, preparation and surface–interface tailoring of semiconductor-based photocatalytic materials with insights into the underlying physical chemistry.
2. Experimental
2.1 Photocatalyst synthesis and general remarks
Bi5FeTi3O15 photocatalysts were synthesized by a hydrothermal process (the detailed preparation procedures are given in the ESI†). The phase purity of the as-obtained samples was determined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer by using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 293 K within the range of 5–80°. XRD pattern simulations were conducted using the POWDERCELL program.24 The scanning electron microscope (SEM) characterizations were performed on a Hitachi S-3500N scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization was performed on a JEOL-JEM 2100 electron microscope. The energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) was performed on an EDX G2T20136-5 energy-dispersive X-ray instrument. The optical UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the samples were measured at room temperature on a Shimadzu SolidSpec-3700DUV spectrophotometer. The standard BaSO4 sphere was used as a reference for baseline correction within 200–800 nm. The surface areas of the samples were determined from the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation on an Autosorb-IQ-MP at −196 °C. Before BET analysis, the samples were degassed at 180 °C for 3 h by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms recorded at 77 K with a QUADRASORB IQ (Quantachrome Instrument Corp.). The surface charges were measured with ζ-potential measurements by a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK). In a typical procedure, the sample (1.0 mg mL−1) was dispersed in water at different pH values and sonicated for about 5 min for analysis. The pH of the solutions was adjusted by adding 0.1 mol L−1 HCl or NaOH solution. The time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra were carried out on an FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments) with 348.0 nm excitation. All samples were tested at room temperature. The decay curve was fitted according to the following equations:25  where A is the initial intensity of the decay component, and τ (ns) is the emission lifetime of the component.
2.2 Photocatalytic activity tests
For photocatalytic activity measurement, 40.0 mg of as-obtained sample was added to 100 mL of 1.0 × 10−5 mol L−1 aqueous solution of tetracycline, and this suspension was magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 min to ensure adsorption equilibrium and enforce dispersity among the photocatalyst, tetracycline and water before the degradation experiment was carried out. The solution was then exposed to light irradiation from a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Perfect Light Company, Beijing, China) equipped with a cutoff filter (λ ≥ 420 nm). After a given irradiation time, the catalysts were separated from the suspensions to discard any sediment for further HPLC measurements. HPLC (UltiMate3000, USA) with a VWD detector (wavelength 355.0 nm) and a Cosmosil 5C18-MS-II (particle size 5.0 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) was applied. Before the HPLC measurement, the calibration curves were obtained for standards of known concentrations, and the R value was about 0.9982. In a typical measurement, 2.0 mL of solution was withdrawn at given reaction time intervals, and then filtered with a 0.45 μm filter. For HPLC, 40% methanol and 60% water (pH = 3.0) were used as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 at 35 °C. The above procedure was repeated six times exactly with same photocatalyst and reactor. Then the sample was collected and dried for XRD measurement to test the photocatalyst's stability.
2.3 The degradation pathway analysis
Identification of the final degradation products was performed by liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-MS, Q STAR Elite) with an electro spray ionization (ESI) source. After the reaction, the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC: methanol–water (40/60, v/v) was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1, injection volumes were 5.0 μL, the vaporizer temperatures were 300 °C, and the source voltage and cone voltage were set to 3500 and 30 V, respectively. The eluents from the chromatographic column successively entered the ESI interface and the spectra were scanned with a positive ion mode at a mass range of 100 to 500 m/z.
2.4 Total organic carbon (TOC) analysis
After a given irradiation time, the degradation products were filtered and further analyzed by TOC measurement on a vario TOC (Elementar, Germany) analyzer. A standard solution of potassium hydrogen phthalate was applied to draw a standard curve, and the R value was about 0.9993. The TOC removal percentage (%) was calculated with the following equation:26 TOC removal (%) = (TOCo − TOCt)/TOCo × 100%, where TOCo = initial TOC, and TOCt = varied TOC at given time t in ppm.
2.5 Detection of active species
To determine and reveal the role of various kinds of photocatalytic-dependent radicals and reaction mechanisms, a series of scavenger test experiments were conducted. Herein, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), ammonium oxalate (AO), p-benzoquinone (PBQ) and AgNO3 were used for hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), holes (h+), superoxide radicals (˙O2−) and electron (e−) scavengers, respectively.
2.6 Detection of active species by electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements
The spin-trapping experiments were carried out by using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO), and 1-hydroxy-3-carboxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine (CPH) for ˙O2−, ˙OH, e− and h+ detection, respectively. In typical measurements, 10 mg of sample was dispersed in 5.0 mL of methanol which had been bubbled with oxygen for 30 min, and was vigorously shaken for 10 s followed by the addition of 30.0 μL of DMPO/TEMPO and 40.0 μL of CPH solution. The mixture was irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp for a given interval, and was analyzed by ESR.
2.7 The ˙OH radical trapping experiment27
An analysis of the generation of hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) over the samples was carried out on a Hitachi Fluorescence Spectrophotometer F-7000 using terephthalic acid as a fluorescence probe molecule. 5.0 × 10−4 mol L−1 of terephthalic acid was dissolved in 2.0 × 10−3 mol L−1 of NaOH, and 40.0 mg of the sample was added into the above solution. Then the suspension was irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp and the sample reaction solution was used to measure the PL intensity. The PL emission was observed at 425.0 nm excited by 315.0 nm light to confirm the concentrations of generated ˙OH.
2.8 Density functional theory (DFT) computational methodology
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).28 The spin-polarized projector augmented wave (PAW) method and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) electron exchange–correlation functional of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) were applied in our calculations.29–31 Our PAW potentials include 15 valence electrons for Bi (6s25d106p3), 14 for Fe (3p64s23d6), 10 for Ti (3p64s23d2), and 6 for O (2s22p4). Calculations were converged using the K-point mesh with 4 × 4 × 2 divisions along the three reciprocal lattice vectors and the kinetic energy cut-off for the wave function expanded in the plane-wave basis sets was set at 400 eV. To optimize the structures, the calculation was performed until the maximum force upon each relaxed atom was less than 0.05 eV Å−1. The optimized bulk lattice constants for Bi5FeTi3O15 were determined to be a = 5.60, b = 41.08 and c = 5.56 Å, in good agreement with the experimental values of a = 5.43, b = 41.10 and c = 5.47 Å.32 All the atoms were relaxed during geometrical optimization, and the optimized slabs were used for electronic structure analysis. The electronic density of states (DOS) was calculated using the tetrahedron method with Blöchl corrections for Bi5FeTi3O15 systems. In order to obtain the electron distribution percentage, the distribution of empty states was estimated by using the DOS integrals within 1.0 eV from the conduction-band minimum (CBM) for atoms in each layer. The electron distribution percentage was calculated as the ratio of the sum of atoms integrals in each layer to the total DOS integrals.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization of photocatalysts
Bi5FeTi3O15 belongs to the orthorhombic phase, and is crystallized in the Fmm2 (42) space group. The phase purity of the hydrothermally synthesized samples prepared by adjusting the pH of the solution in the range of 7.0–14.0 (denoted as samples 1–6) was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Fig. 2). All characteristic diffraction peaks are in good agreement with the standard Bi5FeTi3O15 phase (JCPDS card no. 82-0063). The results show that all the peaks of the as-prepared samples match well with the simulated XRD (the amplified comparative XRD patterns are given in Fig. S1, in the ESI†). No diffraction peaks from any impurity phases are found, which further confirms the phase purity. The as-synthesized samples also achieved high yields of products, e.g. highly uniform nanoflowers with yields of 98% were obtained in sample 6.
 Fig. 2  Simulated and experimental XRD patterns of samples 1–6. 
The morphologies of the as-obtained samples were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), in which the sample's morphologies vary drastically as the solution pH increases (7.0–14.0). Fig. 3a gives the typical morphology of sample 1 (prepared at pH = 7.0), exhibiting nanoparticles with an average length of 20–40 nm and an average diameter of about 5.0–10 nm with high uniformity and well-dispersed elements (Fig. S2, in the ESI†); when the pH increases to 9.0, long nanorods are the predominant feature with an average length of 800–1200 nm and a diameter of 40–80 nm (sample 2), while the few nanoparticles at the ends of the nanorods indicate that the growth of the nanorods may be initialized with nanoparticles along a specific oriented direction (Fig. 3b). When the pH increases to 10.0, the nanosheet becomes the dominant morphology (sample 3 in Fig. 3c). Hierarchical flower-like morphologies of sample 4 with an average diameter of about 1.5–2.8 μm were obtained when the pH of the solution increased to 11.0. The partial images in the upper right side of Fig. 3d reveal evidence that these flower-like morphologies take shape as the result of a self-assembly process of numerous nanosheets. Sample 5 (prepared in pH = 12.0) exhibits flower-like microspheres consisting of further assemblies from nanosheets as petals, with an average size of about 1.5–3.2 μm. The inserted picture in Fig. 3e is a magnified SEM image of sample 5, which clearly shows the huge nanosheets taking on flower-like hierarchical nanosheet structures. The above observations demonstrate that varying pH values while retaining other properties consistently yields Bi5FeTi3O15 with distinct morphologies via different self-assembled growth processes. This pH-tailored morphology can be extended by preparation in highly alkaline solution (pH = 14.0), in which sample 6 gives a very obvious and uniform flower morphology with an average size of about 1.5–3.0 μm, as depicted in Fig. 3f. It is predicted that nanoflowers obtained at pH = 12.0 are rolled up together to form an ideal 3D flower-like morphology (the corresponding elemental mapping for sample 6 is shown in Fig. S3, in the ESI†). It should be reemphasized that all the hydrothermally synthesized Bi5FeTi3O15 samples with different particle shapes and morphologies were formed simply by changing the pH of the reaction solution. Thus, the pH of the hydrothermal synthesis is a significant and vital factor for successful controlling the different morphological architectures of Bi5FeTi3O15 by using the template-free hydrothermal synthesis merely by changing the pH of the precursor.

(f) 3D flower-like morphology of sample 6 obtained in a highly alkaline solution (pH = 14.0). 
The detailed morphologies of the samples were further investigated by TEM analysis to verify the microstructures and growth behaviors. The typical morphologies of samples 1–3 and sample 6 are shown in Fig. 4. Sample 1 comprised nanoparticles with an average diameter of about 10–20 nm, and the average size distributions of as-obtained nanoparticles are shown in the inset of Fig. 4a. The HRTEM images provide the structural details of sample 1, in which the average d space of two lattices is determined to be 0.273 nm, which corresponds to the separation of lattice plane (002), as depicted in Fig. 4b. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images testify to the single crystalline character of the nanoparticles (inset in Fig. 4b). Large amounts of long nanorods are observed in sample 2 with an average length and diameter of about 800–1500 nm and 50–100 nm, respectively. The average diameter size distribution of the nanorods is shown in the inserted picture (Fig. 4c). The HRTEM taken from the edge of sample 2 shows interplanar spaces of about 0.195 nm, corresponding to the lattice distance of (101), which gives the growth orientation of the nanorods along the [101] direction (Fig. 4d). The SAED pattern of the edge of the single nanorod indicates the single crystalline nature of sample 2 (Fig. 4d).

(g) TEM image of an individual flower-like structure of sample 6 and (h) HRTEM image recorded on the marked area of the panel. Inset (h) corresponding SAED images of nanosheets of sample 6. 
The TEM images of sample 3 (Fig. 4e) exhibit a uniform thin nanosheet morphology with lengths of about 150–300 nm. The HRTEM image shows an interplanar spacing of about 0.381 nm and 0.375 nm, respectively, close to the separation of two adjacent lattice planes (002), implying that the nanosheets of sample 3 lie on (110) facets (Fig. 4f). The corresponding SAED image indicates the single crystalline nature of the obtained nanosheets, as shown in the inset in Fig. 4f. Fig. 4g shows the TEM image of sample 6, which comprises nanoflower morphologies with an average length of about 1.5–3.0 μm. The HRTEM image of one plate from this flower is studied to provide the structural details of sample 6, as depicted in Fig. 4h, in which the interplanar spacing values of the crystalline stripes are about 0.381 nm, 0.274 nm and 0.273 nm, corresponding well with the adjacent lattices of the (111), (002) and (200) planes of the nanoplate. This indicates that the nanosheets unfurled along the (002) and (200) directions to form 3D flowers in the (101) plane, indicating the microstructure of sample 6. The TEM images of the as-prepared samples illustrate that the uniformly aligned nanoparticles grow in specific directions to form nanosheets, which make flowers first. With an increase in alkalinity, these nanosheets overlap and roll up together to form very beautiful spherical flowers, which are all consistent with the observed morphologies from the SEM results. Hence, it can be confirmed that the hydrothermally synthesized Bi5FeTi3O15 samples display a self-assembling process, which is modulated by the pH changes of the solution.
Based on the SEM and TEM results, a possible crystal growth mechanism is proposed. It involves several steps, such as nucleation, growth along specific directions and a self-assembly process for the construction of a hierarchical architecture. During the synthesis, the precursors show different rates of solubility with increasing pH values of the solution, and thus nanoparticle crystal seeds are generated (Scheme 1a). With a further increase in solution pH, the nucleation of some ions is inhibited, then nanoparticles grow anisotropically along the (101) direction to form nanorods (Scheme 1b). Since the Bi5FeTi3O15 itself has a layered structure, in which [Bi2O2]2+ atomic layers are sandwiched between two [Bi3FeTi3O13]2− layers and are parallel to the (001) facets. Thus, the 2D nanosheets are formed as a result of oriented growth towards two (002) directions (Scheme 1c). Herein, the Ostwald ripening process is involved, and the nanorods grow until all the nanoparticles are consumed, accompanied by self-organization into nanosheets. As can be seen from the SEM and TEM exhibits, the as-obtained nanosheets are very thin, on which lots of defects are observed, indicating the existence of mutual stresses on the nanosheet's surface. Thus, with overlapping and rolling to different directions, the nanosheets incline to form along the vertical and horizontal directions via bridging to form nano-blocks (Scheme 1d–f). Therefore, a 3D flower-like hierarchical morphology is constructed as a result of the self-assembly process, then the flowers roll up together to give uniform 3D flowers with curled petals (Scheme 1g–i). Thus, pH values have a significant impact on the 3D flower-like hierarchical growth process of Bi5FeTi3O15, as schematically illustrated in Scheme 1k.

From the SEM and TEM exhibits, it can be found that some porous structures are presented on the surface of samples 4–6, leading to the increased surface areas of the samples. To further understand the surface properties of the as-obtained nanostructures, the BET surface area measurements were carried out by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption method. The specific surface areas of samples 1–6 are different and determined to be 31.6 m2 g−1, 11.7 m2 g−1, 13.2 m2 g−1, 33.4 m2 g−1, 56.6 m2 g−1 and 77.0 m2 g−1, respectively (Fig. 5). The BET specific surface area increases with an increase in pH values, and the rather different surface areas of identical nanoflowers observed in samples 4–6 may be ascribed to their microstructures. The hierarchical nanoflower structure of sample 6 gives a significantly higher surface area (77.0 m2 g−1) than samples 1–5. During the photocatalytic procedure, morphologies like these are expected to adsorb more reactant and species as they provide interfacial active sites, and to some degree, they will contribute to efficiency enhancement during the photocatalytic process.

Fig. 6a shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the as-obtained samples, and all samples exhibit notable absorption in the visible light region (λ ≥ 420 nm). The strengthened absorbance is favourable to the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of the as-obtained samples. Wavelengths shorter than 600 nm can be assigned to the intrinsic band gap absorption of Bi5FeTi3O15 due to the electron transitions from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) (O 2p + Bi 6s + Fe t2g → Ti 3d).14–16 The Kubelka–Munk theory33 correlation relation was applied for band gap calculations and the diffuse reflectance spectra of the Bi5FeTi3O15 samples are depicted in Fig. 6b. The band gaps of the samples are in the range of 1.94–2.13 eV and the corresponding morphologies and band gaps as well as other information are listed in Table 1. From the structural point of view, the interaction between Ti4+ and Fe (Fe3+/Fe2+) is considered to be in the form of Fe–O–Ti, which causes trace amounts of oxygen vacancies for charge balance in the structure. Thus, it is not a surprise to assume that the strong and broad visible light absorptions may originate from oxygen vacancies in the structure. DRS results also suggest that as the pH of solution increases, the absorption edges of the resulting diverse morphological samples display a blue shift.

Observed blue shifts in samples can be ascribed to the following two influential factors: (i) with an increase in the pH value during the synthesis, the surface charge states are varied with the concentrations of adsorbed hydroxide ions on the surface of the Bi5FeTi3O15 samples. In lower pH solution, the Bi3+ ions exist in relatively high concentration since the hydrolyzations are greatly inhibited and display relatively small particle sizes, which can hold a large electronic density of Bi 6s, resulting in the more negative energy levels of the valence band. Therefore, the pH values of the precursors and sample's surface properties are the important factors causing blue shifts. (ii) The optical property and diffusion of the photo-induced electrons and holes are relevant to the sample's local crystal structure. The Bi5FeTi3O15 acquire unique layered structures and diverse morphologies with different surface atomic arrangements (Fig. S4, in the ESI†); thus its alternative layers have good light transmittance that can promote the visible light spread. In addition, pH-induced band gap variations are mainly related to the electronic structures, leading to delocalization of electron–hole pairs, and resulting in assorted carrier mobilities. Thus, observed blue shifts in Bi5FeTi3O15 should be ascribed to local crystal microstructures.
For Bi5FeTi3O15, the valence band (VB) is comprised of hybridized O 2p + Bi 6s + Fe t2g orbitals and the corresponding conduction band (CB) is mainly formed by Ti 3d CB states. The bottom of the CB and the top of the VB can be estimated empirically from ECB = χ − Ec − 0.5Eg and EVB = Eg + ECB,34,35 thus the corresponding edges of the CB of Bi5FeTi3O15 are determined to be 0.5862–0.4712 eV, and the edge positions of the VB are estimated to be 2.536–2.601 eV, respectively (Table 1). Scheme 2 illustrates the effect of pH values during synthesis on the CB and VB levels of the resulting samples. The band gap becomes larger and these variations display good agreement with visible light absorption, e.g., the blue shift properties of the samples. From the requirements of thermodynamics for photocatalytic reactions, the higher CB is beneficial for the formation of more reductive electrons, which enhance rapid transfer to the surface of the photocatalyst. Hence, both efficient separations of electron–hole pairs and enhanced photoactivity can be expected. On the other hand, the downshifting of the VB also tends to form more oxidative species, such as ˙OH, which should also accelerate the reaction.36

3.2 Photocatalytic activity evaluations
Herein, the widely used antibiotic, tetracycline, is chosen as a trial molecular pollutant for photocatalytic degradation using as-obtained Bi5FeTi3O15 samples, including nanoparticles (sample 1), nanorods (sample 2), nanosheets (sample 3) and nanoflowers (sample 6). The curves of degradation efficiency versus reaction time for samples are shown in Fig. 7a, and these illustrate that after 20 min of light irradiation, the concentration of tetracycline over sample 6 almost reaches zero. After 60 min of irradiation of visible light, the final concentrations of tetracycline decrease to 12.96% (nanoparticles), 24.71% (nanorods), 1.519% (nanosheets), and 0.6602% (nanoflowers). These results show that the Bi5FeTi3O15 samples with the flower-like (sample 6) and nanosheet shapes (sample 3) display a relatively higher degradation efficiency ∼99.34% and 98.48% for tetracycline removal. Overall, all samples display much higher efficiency for pollutant decompositions than that reported for bulk Bi5FeTi3O15 (dye degradation efficiency ∼5.87%).37 This advanced oxidation process is compared with the tetracycline degradation efficiency of recently reported Fe-based photocatalysts in the literature. Clearly, various morphological Bi5FeTi3O15 samples exhibit much higher decomposition efficiency than that of the documented examples, as summarized in the comparative results in Table S1, in the ESI.† These results also show that successful surface–interface engineered photocatalysts, e.g., the 3D flower-like shaped Bi5FeTi3O15, could significantly enhance the photocatalytic capability. The effective incorporation of Ti, Bi, and Fe compounds without doping together with ferroelectric properties may greatly boost the photooxidation reactions, which makes this perovskite Bi5FeTi3O15 a potential candidate for practical implementation.

(c) Six successive runs of tetracycline photodecomposition by sample 6 under visible light irradiation. (d) XRD patterns of sample 6 before and after reaction. 
To evaluate the energy conversion efficiency of each sample, their quantum efficiencies (QEs) were also calculated. The QE is defined as:38,39  where d[x]/dt is the rate of change in the concentration of the reactant (or product) and d[hv]inc/dt is the total optical power impinging on the sample. In the present work, the QE (%) of the degradation of tetracycline by sample 6 is 39.47%. Since the QE does not take the fraction of light absorbed by the photocatalyst into account, the QE was calculated in terms of light irradiation with a wavelength of 420 nm. Under the same reaction condition with 420 nm light irradiation, the QEs (%) of the other samples are: sample 1 (34.82%), sample 2 (30.12%) and sample 3 (39.39%), and the calculated QEs are even higher than for our previously reported defective TiO2 (Eg = 2.63 eV), in which about 31% QE was observed for visible light degradation of methyl blue.40
To further quantitatively compare the photocatalytic performances of different morphological samples, the tetracycline degradation kinetics in the presence of four selected samples are studied according to the Langmuir–Hinshelwood equation (the pseudo-first-order rate equation): ln(Co/C) = kt.38,39 As depicted in Fig. 7b, the samples show a linear relationship between ln(Co/C) and t (min), which indicates that the photodegradation of tetracycline obeys the rules of first-order kinetics. The apparent rate constants k (min−1) of the tetracycline decompositions in the presence of selected samples are 0.0395 ± 0.047 min−1 for sample 1, 0.0233 ± 0.073 min−1 for sample 2, 0.0996 ± 0.042 min−1 for sample 3 min−1 and 0.197 ± 0.058 min−1 for sample 6. It is generally accepted that the larger the rate constant k, the higher the photocatalytic activity.
Impressively, a significantly enhanced photooxidation performance is observed for 3D flower-like Bi5FeTi3O15 with a degradation rate constant of 1.97 × 10−1 min−1, nearly 5.1, 8.5 and 1.97 times faster than that of its counterparts: nanoparticles, nanorods and nanosheets. More interestingly, both sample 2 and sample 3 acquire similar specific surface areas (11.721 m2 g−1 and 13.151 m2 g−1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1), and the measured normalized pseudo-first-order rate constant for sample 3 (7.57 × 10−3 g min−1 m−2) is ∼3.82-fold higher than that for sample 2 (1.98 × 10−3 g min−1 m−2). The comparative photoactivities of the samples provide evidence that sample 6 displays the highest degradation performance and it can be seen from the above results that the surface areas of the samples, to some extent determine the efficiency of degradation of tetracycline. We concluded that assorted photooxidation activities were observed with diverse morphological Bi5FeTi3O15 samples, among which the hierarchical flower-shaped Bi5FeTi3O15 displays the best photocatalytic performance with the highest degradation efficiency (99.34%) and the largest apparent rate constant (0.197 min−1) over other samples. As such, the representative sample 6 is selected for additional study.
To investigate the recyclable applications of the samples, six cycles of photocatalytic experiment were carried out over sample 6 under the same reaction conditions, as shown in Fig. 7c (the other sample's stability tests are given in Fig. S5a–c, in the ESI†). No obvious deterioration in efficiency was observed even after 360 min of irradiation with visible light, suggesting the high efficiency and good stability of our sample 6, which can also be evidenced by the nearly unchanged XRD patterns of sample 6 after the sixth run (Fig. 7d).
LC-MS was used to identify the intermediates and final degradation products of tetracycline. The molecular mass numbers of the final products are shown in Fig. 8a (the corresponding HPLC spectra and MS analysis are given in Fig. S6, in the ESI†). The LC-MS results suggest that the main characteristic peak (m/z = 445) of the tetracycline was detected before light illumination and its intensity decreased gradually after visible light irradiation. Upon photocatalytic reaction, numerous new peaks appeared at different photodegradation times, including m/z = 467, m/z = 401, m/z = 348/349, m/z = 325, m/z = 311, m/z = 283, m/z = 265, m/z = 248/249, m/z = 236/231, m/z = 227, m/z = 187, m/z = 140, m/z = 128, and m/z = 110/111. Peaks observed at 10 min are elucidated as follows. The peak at around m/z = 467 can be ascribed to 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and the introduction of a hydroxyl group. The peak at m/z of 401 is due to the observed loss of an N-methyl group. Note that at this point, the original main peak of tetracycline at m/z = 445 has completely disappeared. Peaks due to new intermediates with m/z = 248, 227, 187 and 140 have appeared. Then, after 20 min of exposure in visible light, the intensity of all the previously observed peaks at 10 min is notably attenuated. After 30 min, the previous intermediate peaks at m/z = 401, 187 and m/z = 141 have completely vanished and lighter peaks of m/z = 349, 283, 231 and 111 have appeared. These new peaks are ascribed to the even smaller fragmentations of the main m/z loss of the amino, hydroxyl and methyl groups, while the fragmentation of the phenolic groups connected to the aromatic ring gives a peak at m/z = 283. The peaks at m/z = 231, 187, 128 and 110 are the daughter peaks of the species at m/z = 348 due to ring reaction. After 40 min, the original characteristic tetracycline peak at m/z = 445 and other intermediate peaks at m/z = 187, 231 and 401 have completely vanished, but are accompanied by the formation of new peaks at 227, 265, 310 and 325. It is worth noting that all the peak intensities are gradually decreasing as the irradiation time increases (Fig. S6, in the ESI†). The partial fragments of tetracycline degradation products are summarized in Fig. 8a. The MS study demonstrates the sufficient photooxidation of tetracycline and its complete mineralization in the presence of Bi5FeTi3O15 samples under visible light irradiation. The evidence of mineralization is further confirmed by the total organic carbon (TOC) study using samples 1–3 and sample 6 as the photocatalyst, as shown in Fig. 8b and c. About 82.34%, 70.02%, 94.88% and 93.21% of TOC is removed in the presence of samples 1–3 and sample 6 within 60 min, demonstrating that tetracycline is oxidized by oxidative radicals to CO2, H2O, and inorganic ions NH4+, NH3. Our study clearly identifies the nature of the final products, which is critical information with which to judge whether a photocatalytic oxidation process would produce secondary toxic species.

3.3 Clarification of the degradation mechanism
It has been well accepted that ferroelectric materials have advantages on effective charge separation due to a strong internal field. The interleaved [Bi2O2]2+ units and TiO6 octahedron in Bi5FeTi3O15 perovskites offer anisotropic ferroelectric properties. While the aurivillius intergrowth phases consist of perovskite blocks sandwiched between the [Bi2O2]2+ slabs and display polarization along the c direction.41 The Bi5FeTi3O15 possesses distorted units, forming dipole-induced internal fields, which can facilitate charge separation.
On the other hand, the variations in edge positions might originate from the assorted electron distributions as the studied sample has different layers. To further investigate the electron–hole separation on different layers of [Bi3FeTi3O13]2− and [Bi2O2]2+ in the studied sample, first-principles density functional theory (DFT) studies of the density of states (DOS) were performed using an optimized unit cell in the Bi5FeTi3O15 crystal. Herein, the empty states within the 1.0 eV window above the conduction band minimum (CBM) were selected, as depicted in Fig. 9a and b, and the electron densities of each layer were analyzed. The number of atoms in each layer is presented in Fig. S7, in the ESI.† The same calculation method was applied to examine the metal oxyhydroxide coating effects on the photoanode in our previous work.42 The electron densities were calculated with the integral percentage of every atom in five different layers. It can be seen from the quantitative DFT analysis of the empty electronic states distribution that the electron densities of the first and last layers are almost the same (∼22.02%), largely because they have exactly the same structure, i.e. [Bi3FeTi3O13]2− (Fig. 9c). Interestingly, it was found that rather low electron densities of approximately 2.23% and 2.62% were obtained in two [Bi2O2]2+ layers (Fig. 9d and Table S2, in the ESI†). These calculation results indicate that the higher electrons densities in [Bi3FeTi3O13]2− layers can favour electron transfer in comparison with [Bi2O2]2+ layers. In other words, transport of photogenerated electrons and holes can occur in alternate layers, promoting longer charge carrier lifetimes, which was further studied by time-resolved PL.
 Fig. 9  Layered structures and the calculated relative amount of empty states within the 1.0 eV window above the CB minimum are plotted as percentages beside the corresponding regions. 
To further reveal the origin of such high photoactivities for the samples, a time-resolved PL study was carried out. As presented in Fig. 10 and Table 2, the PL lifetimes of selected samples are 3.4 ns (sample 1, nanoparticles), 7.3 ns (sample 2, nanorods), 6.1 ns (sample 3, nanosheets) and 6.5 ns (sample 6, nanoflowers). The nanoparticle morphology (sample 1) showed the shortest charge lifetime (3.4 ns) due to its lower crystallinity than the others. It is noted that the PL lifetimes of sample 2, sample 3 and sample 6 are one order of magnitude longer than that of reported TiO2 with the predominant (001) exposed facets (0.65 ns).43 Thus, it can be concluded from time-resolved PL analysis that the carrier lifetimes increased in the studied samples because of enhanced electron densities in [Bi3FeTi3O13]2− layers, which could favour the transport of photogenerated electrons and holes in alternate layers and thus promote longer charge carrier lifetimes. The time-resolved PL results agree well with our DFT study.

The band edge positions should be suitable in terms of the electrochemical potentials of the activate redox reactions. Photocatalytic decomposition of organics in the presence of O2 generally involves (i) photoexcitation of electrons from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB); (ii) oxidation of an organic compound directly via the VB holes or indirectly with the surface-bound hydroxyl radical (˙OH); and (iii) reduction of O2 by the CB electrons. Increased over-potentials, i.e., the difference between the VB top potential and the oxidation potential and the difference between the CB bottom potential and the reduction potential, are favourable for the redox reactions.1–3 In the second step of photolysis, the recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes takes place. If this carrier recombination of the lattice reaction does not involve the photogenerated pairs, the CB electrons invoke the reduction reactions on the sample's surface, while the oxidation reaction occurs with positively charged holes. Our band edge position calculations suggest that the formation of ˙O2− is not suitable for ˙O2− generation since the O2/˙O2− (−0.046 eV vs. NHE) is located above the CB of all the samples (0.59–0.47 eV) at pH = 7.0.7–9 According to the results of the CB electrons of the studied samples, and electron transfer between metals, Fe3+/Fe2+ (0.771 eV vs. NHE)20 and Ti4+/Ti3+ (−0.498 eV vs. NHE) could react with surface-adsorbed O2, then generate further ˙O2− and ˙OH radicals. These formed radicals further enhance charge separation and thus enhance the tetracycline decomposition efficiency. It is worth mentioning that downshifting of the VB also facilitates the capture of holes by OH− to form ˙OH radicals. The overall scheme for the degradation of organic matter could be due to the following reactions: Charge separation: Bi5FeTi3O15 + hv → hVB+ + eCB−(1) H2O (surface) + hVB+ → –OH + H+(2) −OH + hVB+ → ˙OH(3) O2 (surface) + eCB− → ˙O2−(4) O2 (surface) + eCB− (transferred) → ˙O2−(5) ˙O2− + tetracycline → H2O + CO2(6) ˙OH + tetracycline → H2O + CO2(7)
Certainly, the competitive reaction is the recombination of electrons and holes either in the bulk or in the surface of the solid catalysts, denoted as hVB+ + eCB− → recombination(8)
This circulation can be repeated until the tetracycline is decomposed into smaller fragments by radicals such as h+, ˙OH, ˙O2− and e−, due to their high oxidation/reduction potentials. Based on the above discussions, we propose an energy level diagram of sample 6 to explain the tetracycline degradation mechanism, as shown in Fig. 11.
 Fig. 11  Schematic illustration of the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of tetracycline over sample 6. 
To further explore the nature of tetracycline degradation in the Bi5FeTi3O15–tetracycline system, a series of trapping experiments were carried out, including p-benzoquinone (BQ) as an ˙O2− trapper, isopropyl (IPA) as an ˙OH trapper, AgNO3 as an e− trapper and ammonium oxalate (AO) as an h+ trapper. As shown in Fig. 12a, the degradation efficiency of tetracycline is significantly suppressed in the presence of PBQ and IPA in solution, while the degradation is also somewhat inhibited when AO is in the reaction system. However, no predominant changes were observed when AgNO3 was introduced into the reaction as an e− trapper. These controlled trapping experiments clearly suggest that the ˙O2−, ˙OH and h+ should be the major radicals for tetracycline degradation for sample 6. Fig. 12b illustrates the tetracycline degradation with trappers on samples 1–3 and sample 6. Clearly, AgNO3 shows a negligible effect on tetracycline photodegradation, implying that the e− does not play a major role. Interestingly, the addition of AgNO3 is even found to be beneficial to the tetracycline photodegradation on sample 1 and sample 2. We think that such a phenomenon can be ascribed to the suppressed recombination by trapping of e−via Ag+ + e− → Ag07 (see specific trapping analyses in Fig. S8–S10, in the ESI†). Nonetheless, the above trapping experiments show that ˙O2−, h+ and ˙OH are the pivotal scavenger radicals for tetracycline decomposition. Furthermore, for measurement accuracy, the spin-trapping tests were also carried out over the aforementioned radicals. 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), a typical spin-trapping agent, is used to trap ˙O2− radicals. No obvious characteristic ˙O2− was detected without light irradiation, implying that there were no ˙O2− produced in samples in the absence of light. Upon preirradiation of sample 6 with visible light for about 3 min, the ESR signals from ˙O2− were detected, as shown in Fig. 12c. Moreover, the characteristic sextet peaks of ˙O2− were uniformly intensified after 5 min of light irradiation, revealing that sample 6 was capable of producing more ˙O2− species upon longer light irradiation.

Inset: the plot of the induced PL intensity (at 425 nm) vs. irradiation time. 
To elucidate the role of electrons for tetracycline oxidation, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) is used as an electron spin trapper.44Fig. 12d shows the electron ESR signal variation in an aqueous solution containing sample 6 and TEMPO under light irradiation. No obvious ESR signals were detected without light irradiation, implying that the free electrons must be generated by light. After 3 min of light irradiation, an ESR triplet peak with an intensity of 1:1:1 was detected and the intensity of the triplet uniformly increased after 5 min of light irradiation, demonstrating that photoexcited electrons are formed. As the photoelectrons are captured by surface-adsorbed O2 to form ˙O2−, thus, logically, these free electron must be transported via the Ti 3d CB states. As discussed in the DRS analysis, the electron transfer between metals (Ti4+–O–Fe2+–Ti3+–O–Fe3+) can be trapped by surface-adsorbed O2 to form superoxide radicals. It should be pointed out that the Fe/Ti is located at the same crystallographic positions in the unit cell, which give an opportunity for carrier recombination. The formed oxygen vacancies could become trapping sites and reduce recombination rates.45,46 The same phenomena were observed in Fe-doped SrTiO3, Ti4+–O–Sn2+ and Ti4+–O–Cu+ systems, whose CB also consists of Ti 3d.47–49
On the other hand, hole transport in the VB through the metal ions (Bi 6s and Fe t2g orbitals) can be studied by the hole spin-trapping agent 1-hydroxy-3-carboxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine (CPH). As presented in Fig. 12e, the characteristic triplet signals of the h+ radical were detected and became stronger with an increase in irradiation time. The studies of the radicals involved on the other samples are given in Fig. S8–S10 in the ESI.† However, no obvious ESR characteristic signals of ˙OH were detected even after 20 min of visible light irradiation. Since both the quantitative trapping experiments and suitable band edge positions of sample 6 indicate that ˙OH is involved in the reaction, PL spectroscopy is used to verify the existence of ˙OH.27 We use terephthalic acid as a fluorescence probe to generate 2-hydroxy-terephthalic acid with ˙OH. As presented in Fig. 12f, no significant PL signals were observed before visible light irradiation treatment. After visible light irradiation, a characteristic PL signal for 2-hydroxy-terephthalic acid at ∼425 nm emerges and intensifies with an increase in visible light irradiation time. Thus, our PL study clearly identifies the existence of ˙OH radicals (Fig. 12f). Furthermore, the inset of Fig. 12f shows that the concentration of ˙OH correlates linearly with the irradiation time, suggesting that sample 6 is stable and responds linearly to the amount of incident photons (the corresponding ˙OH generations over samples 1–3 are given in Fig. S8–S10, in the ESI†). While the above studies clearly demonstrate the existence of key radicals (˙O2−, h+ and partial e−) needed in the photodegradation reaction, the previous MS study identifies the fragments from the tetracycline decomposition, both of which collaboratively support the validity of our proposed reaction mechanism.
Surface area plays an important role in assuring the required surface reaction sites. Therefore, the BET surface areas of samples 1–3 and sample 6 were taken into consideration and might be one of the prime reasons for efficiency enhancements (Fig. 5). It can been seen that the exact surface areas per unit mass vary significantly in different samples prepared under different pH values, as in the order of sample 6 (77.0 m2 g−1) > sample 1 (31.6 m2 g−1) > sample 3 (13.2 m2 g−1) > sample 2 (11.7 m2 g−1). The differences in surface area can be ascribed to their distinct morphologies, among which the nanoparticles and flower-like morphologies exhibit a larger surface area than nanosheets and nanorods. It is well accepted that a larger surface area will provide more active reaction sites and affect the surface absorption (pollutant, O2 and ˙OH) property for the photocatalyst, accelerating the effective separation of electron–hole pairs and thus further enhancing the photocatalytic activity. It is intriguing that although sample 3 exhibits a smaller BET surface area than sample 1, the measured normalized pseudo-first-order photocatalytic reaction rate constant for sample 3 (7.6 × 10−3 g min−1 m−2) is notably greater (∼6.3 folds higher) than that for sample 1 (1.2 × 10−3 g min−1 m−2). To gain insight into such an inconsistency, we directly studied the adsorption of the tetracycline molecules onto the samples.
As shown in Fig. 13a, the as-obtained samples give tetracycline adsorption in the following order: sample 6 (43.25%) > sample 3 (38.56%) > sample 2 (35.76%) > sample 1 (15.61%) (summarized in Table 3). The largest BET surface area and the highest tetracycline adsorption are observed in sample 6, despite sample 1, sample 2 and sample 6 exhibiting similar normalized rate constants. Clearly, sample 3 exhibits much greater tetracycline adsorption than sample 1, and gives the largest normalized rate constant. Therefore, besides surface area, other factors such as surface charge on the samples can strongly affect the nature of the tetracycline adsorption. Hence, we further studied the surface ζ-potential of the samples. Fig. 13b shows the measured ζ-potentials of the studied samples. The ζ-potentials of sample 1 (obtained at pH = 7.0) show a positive charge for a pH between 1.0 and 9.0, and decrease as the pH increases. Compared with sample 1, the ζ-potentials of sample 2, sample 3 and sample 6 become more negative, agreeing with the fact that they are synthesized under more basic conditions. This finding explains why sample 3 exhibits greater tetracycline adsorption in our photocatalytic study at pH = 7.0, since tetracycline is zwitterionic with a negative charge at pH = 7.0. The more negative charges on the sample surface favour tetracycline adsorption and the surface hydroxyl groups can trap the holes to promote charge separation.

It is worth noting that the tetracycline molecule exhibits an amphoteric character with diverse protonation–deprotonation behaviours, as it displays a positive charge when the pH < 3.5, zwitterions at 3.5 < pH < 7.68 and a strong negative charge at pH > 7.68 (Fig. S11, in the ESI†).5 The photocatalytic reaction in an aqueous solution can be greatly influenced by the pH value of the solution. The pH dependence of the photodegradation of aqueous tetracycline solution over sample 6 is shown in Fig. S12 in the ESI.† As the pH increases, tetracycline encounters more rapid degradation because tetracycline is absorbed on the surface of the catalysts more efficiently in a basic solution.
4. Conclusions
Layered perovskites Bi5FeTi3O15 with diverse morphologies (nanoparticles, nanorods, nanosheets and nanoflowers) were successfully synthesized by varying the pH during hydrothermal synthesis without using any surfactants. The electronic properties, including band structure and band edge positions, surface charge and carrier lifetime, can also be tailored by varying the pH during synthesis to best fit the needs of photocatalytic performance. The structure–performance relationship was investigated by the photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline under visible light, and the nanoflower-like Bi5FeTi3O15 shows the best antibiotic degradation (∼99.34%) and 94.88% total organic carbon removal. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation results indicate that the higher electrons densities in [Bi3FeTi3O13]2− layers can favor the transport of photogenerated electrons and holes in alternate layers, promoting longer charge carrier lifetimes. The reaction mechanism was clearly identified by analyzing the intermediates and final degradation products using LC-MS, free radicals and a spin trapping study, showing that photoinduced holes, and hydroxyl and superoxide radicals are the major contributors to tetracycline decomposition. More importantly, the charge transfer between metals, high surface areas, suitable band edge positions, efficient adsorption and successful prevention of carrier recombination altogether contribute to the high performance effectiveness of the Bi5FeTi3O15 for pollutant degradation. This work provided fundamental understanding about tuning the relations among synthesis, properties, and performance for the further development of high-performance photocatalysts via a materials-by-design approach and their application in real-case scenarios.
