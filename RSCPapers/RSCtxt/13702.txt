    , Accepted 16th September 2020First published on 18th September 2020AbstractLithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for next-generation energy storage systems due to their advantages of its high specific capacity and low material cost. Regrettably, the electrical insulation nature of sulfur, the volume expansion during lithiation, and the internal shuttle effect aroused by the polysulfides dissolution are the central issues for sulfur cathodes. Here, CoFe2O4@C nanocages derived from Prussian blue analogues and polydopamine were utilized as a sulfur host to address these problems. The polar Co–Fe oxide afforded chemical adsorption sites for anchoring polysulfides to reduce the shuttling effect. The hollow core structure of the nanocages could withstand the large volume change during lithiation and delithiation processes. The conductive carbon layer on the nanocages could ameliorate the extremely low electrical conductivity of S and Li2S. The S/CoFe2O4@C cathode demonstrated high capacity and excellent cyclability (821 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.5C). More importantly, the combinational strategies of good conductivity, physical space encapsulation, and chemical adsorption provide a means of resolving the current cathode issues in Li–S batteries.
Introduction
With increasing efforts to reduce environmental pollution, particularly the issues related to climate change and environmental policy, and the rising huge demand for clean energy, various kinds of renewable and sustainable energy sources, such as solar arrays, wind generators, and tidal power generation, have been developed in the past few decades.1–3 Meanwhile, a number of energy storage technologies have been proposed to make intermittent energy sources more adaptable to the fall-off rate of electrogenesis and the ramp-up needs of homes, vehicles, and industries.4–6 With the continuous developments in solid-state chemistry and physics, lithium-ion batteries are now widely used in the fields of portable electronics, electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and large-scale battery energy storage systems (BESSs) with acceptable energy density and no memory effect and thus can ease the consumption of fossil fuels.7–10 Nevertheless, in consideration of the actual increasing demand for lightweight design, long-lasting battery life, and lower prices, current lithium-ion batteries already have difficulty in meeting these needs because of a shortage of energy density and their too high production cost.11
Comparatively, Li–S batteries have attracted considerable attention as a promising fresh candidate for rechargeable batteries due to their high theoretical energy density of 2500 W h kg−1 or 2800 W h L−1, dramatically outperforming commercialized lithium-ion batteries with a theoretical energy density limited to 420 W h kg−1 or 1400 W h L−1.12 In addition, sulfur is an extremely abundant natural resource, with the advantages of cheapness, easy exploitation, low toxicity, and an environmentally sound production.13 However, three well-known key drawbacks hinder the further development of such batteries, especially for large scale practical application. Firstly, the soluble intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPS) in the electrolyte may shuttle between electrodes during the cycling process, which is known as the shuttle effect. Second, the extremely low electrical conductivity of sulfur (10−24 S cm−1) and the discharge products Li2S (10−14 S cm−1) lead to a poor rate capability and low utilization of the cathode material.14 Last but not least, the huge volumetric expansion during charge–discharge cycling is inclined to destroy the sulfur cathode.
The typical strategy to solve the above problems is to utilize an appropriate host material for sulfur to improve the cathode's conductivity and to utilize physical or chemical adsorption for the soluble intermediate LiPS. Now, carbon and transition metal oxides (TiO2, MnO2, V2O5, etc.) are the most common host materials for the sulfur cathode.15–18 However, polar LiPS are inherent mediators with a weak chemical binding to typical non-polar carbon. On the contrary, transition metal oxides possess strong chemical interaction with polysulfides, but have the disadvantage of electrical conductivity. Naturally, composite materials with polar metallic oxides and conductive carbon can benefit from both their advantages, respectively, and combine to solve the existing problems in Li–S batteries.
Prussian blue (Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3, PB) is a well-known pigment in the dyeing and printing industry. The crystal structure of PB is regarded as a face-centered cubic lattice, where Fe3+ and Fe2+ are connected by cyanogens.19 More importantly, the iron element can be substituted by a transition element (e.g., Mn, Co, and Ni) without breaking the crystal structure, leading to Prussian blue analogs (PBAs). The hollow products can usually be derived from thermal treatment of PBA precursors. The hollowing mechanism of PBA derivatives is similar to that for metal–organic framework (MOF) compounds. However, PBA with the combination of more complex transition metal elements (e.g., Mn–Co PBA, Ni–Co PBA, Co–Fe PBA, Ni–Fe PBA) has an advantage over other MOF-based precursors.20–23
Herein, we are the first to report on the synthesis of the CoFe2O4@C nanocages with a CoFe2O4 inner shell and carbon outer layer as an effective encapsulation material for sulfur. The inner CoFe2O4 was acquired from a typical CoFe–PBA precursor, and the outer carbon emerged from the carbonization of polydopamine (PDA). The CoFe2O4@C nanocages can offer several advantages: (i) the hollow structure can provide adequate space for sulfur to buffer the enormous volumetric expansion during charge/discharge process; (ii) the polar CoFe2O4 affords adequate physical and chemical adsorption sites for anchoring LiPS; (iii) the superficial carbon layer would facilitate the electrical conductivity of the cathode region in Li–S batteries. Benefitting from the above unique structural features and compositional superiorities, the S/CoFe2O4@C cathode exhibited a highly reversible capacity, superior rate performance, and stable long-term cycling.
Experimental
Chemicals
Potassium ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6], 99.5%), cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O, 99.99%) sodium citrate (C6H5Na3O7, 98%), lithium sulfide (Li2S, 99.98%) sublimed sulfur (S, 99.95%) tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (C4H11NO3, 99.8%) and absolute ethanol (C2H6O, 99.8%) were obtained from Aladdin Chemistry Reagent Co. Ltd. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37 wt%) was obtained from Kermel Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Preparation of the CoFe2O4 nanocages
In a typical procedure, CoCl2·6H2O (237.9 mg) and C6H5Na3O7 (658.5 mg) were dissolved in 20 mL of deionized (DI) water under magnetic stirring at room temperature to form the homogeneous solution A. In the same manner, solution B was prepared by adding K3[Fe(CN)6] (658.5 mg) into 20 mL of DI water. Next, solution A was mixed with solution B under vigorous stirring. Then, the obtained solution was transferred into a flask and maintained at 25 °C for 12 h. The Co–Fe Prussian blue analogue (Co–Fe PBA) precipitates were washed with ethanol and water, then dried at 50 °C under vacuum. Finally, the CoFe2O4 nanocages were obtained by calcining the Co–Fe PBA precursor at 400 °C for 2 h in air.
Preparation of the CoFe2O4@C nanocages
First, 80 mg of the obtained CoFe2O4 nanocages and 40 mg of dopamine were uniformly dispersed in 100 mL of tris-buffer solution (10 mM, pH = 8.5) with magnetic stirring for 4 h. The polydopamine-coated CoFe2O4 (CoFe2O4@PDA) nanocages were collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol and water several times and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C. Finally, the CoFe2O4@C nanocages were acquired via annealing the CoFe2O4 nanocages under an Ar atmosphere at 600 °C for 2 h.
Preparation of the S/CoFe2O4@C composite
The S/CoFe2O4@C composite was synthesized via a simple melt-diffusion method. The CoFe2O4@C nanocages and sublimed sulfur were thoroughly mixed in a weight ratio of 1:3 at room temperature. Then, the obtained mixture was heated at 155 °C for 12 h under Ar in a sealed Teflon container to facilitate sulfur diffusion into the CoFe2O4@C nanocages. The S/CoFe2O4 composite was also achieved by the same method.
Polysulfide adsorption test
The polysulfide solution (10 mM Li2S4) was prepared by adding Li2S and S in a molar ratio of 1:3 in 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) (1:1, v/v) under vigorous magnetic stirring at 50 °C for 24 h. Next, 50 mg of CoFe2O4 or CoFe2O4@C was added into 5 mL of Li2S4 solution, and the adsorption ability was investigated by taking photographs and via UV-vis absorption spectroscopy after 24 h. Afterwards, the deposit at the bottom of the bottle was collected.
Material characterization
The microscopic observations were performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, SU8000, 15 kV) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2100, 200 kV). The crystal structure analysis was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical, X'Pert PRO, Cu Kα) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific, K-Alpha). Thermal analysis was performed using a Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA, TA Instruments, SDTQ600) from room temperature to the target temperature. The electrical conductivity was investigated by four-point probe conductivity measurements (ST2722-SD). The pore size and specific surface area were investigated by means of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) methods with a nitrogen adsorption/desorption instrument (Micrometrics ASAP 2020). The absorbance was determined by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy (Shimadzu, UV-vis 2450).
Electrochemical measurements
The cathodes were fabricated by coating N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) slurry containing S/CoFe2O4@C (or S/CoFe2O4), super P carbon black, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) at a weight ratio of 80:10:10 on Al foil. Coin cells (2032 type) were assembled in a high purity argon-filled glove box, using the coated cathode, lithium foil anode, and separator (Celgard-2300). The electrolyte was composed of DME and DOL in a volume ratio of 1:1, in which 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and 0.2 M LiNO3 were dissolved. The assembled cells were aged for several hours before testing. The galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed between 1.7 and 2.8 V (vs. Li/Li+) by a NEWARE battery testing system (BTS-8000). Cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves were obtained with a CHI-660E electrochemical station. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were carried out by using a Parstat 2273 Advanced Electrochemical Systems within the frequency range of 100 kHz to 10 mHz. All the specific capacity values were calculated based on the mass of sulfur.
Results and discussion
Characterizations of the CoFe2O4@C nanocages
A typical procedure for preparation of the samples is shown in Scheme 1. Co–Fe PBA precursors were synthesized through a simple coprecipitation process.24 The Co/Fe atomic ratio in the CoFe–PBA was 1:2 by controlling the molar ratio of the reactants. After annealing at 400 °C for 2 h in air, the bridging ligands gradually turn into carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), and the Co and Fe metal atoms are oxidized into CoFe2O4 nanocages. The formation of hollow structure nanocages ought to be mainly ascribed to the Kirkendall effect.25 This effect could be easily exploited to invent hollow nanostructures by taking advantage of the difference in diffusion rates of the metal and oxygen species.26 Then the as-synthesized sample was uniformly dispersed in tris-buffer solution. By the self-polymerization of dopamine, the PDA layer was formed on the surface of CoFe2O4 nanocages by adding a specific amount of dopamine under continuous stirring. The as-obtained hybrid was subsequently annealed in argon at 600 °C. During the heating for carbonization, the polydopamine was converted into carbon to obtain CoFe2O4@C nanocages.27 Finally, the S/CoFe2O4@C composite was obtained by mixing the CoFe2O4@C nanocages and sublimed sulfur at 155 °C. Sulfur could infiltrate into the hollow CoFe2O4@C after the melt-diffusion process.

XRD, SEM, and TEM were used for the characterization of the crystal structure and the micromorphology of the obtained products.28 As shown in Fig. 1a and S1,† the prepared Co–Fe PBA precursors were highly uniform with an average size of 310 nm. The XRD pattern of the PBA precursor in Fig. S2† further exhibited that the well-defined peaks were consistent with those reported in ref. 29. The diffraction peaks of the annealed sample in Fig. S3† could be readily indexed to CoFe2O4 (JCPDS card no. 22-1086). The SEM image in Fig. 1b indicated that the CoFe2O4 still maintained the cubic structure with an average diameter of 300 nm in a slight shrinkage of the Co–Fe PBA precursors. Besides, the hollow structure of the CoFe2O4 with the shell thickness of about 20 nm was observed in the TEM image (Fig. 1c). The resultant hollow structure could contain a large amount of sulfur in the nanocages and could accommodate the huge volume change in the process of discharging and charging.

After coating on the CoFe2O4 nanocage with PDA and subsequent carbonization, a uniform thin carbon layer can be clearly observed in the SEM (Fig. 1d) and TEM (Fig. 1e and f) images. As shown in the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image, the interplanar distance marked with arrows was determined to be 0.25 nm and could be attributed to the (311) plane of the CoFe2O4. The carbon layer was thin with a thickness of about 7 nm. In the XRD measurements (Fig. S3†), the broad peak around 2θ = 26° corresponded to the existence of carbon layers.30 Because carbon will be completely oxidized to carbon dioxide (CO2) gas when heated in air, the TGA of CoFe2O4@C was run under air to determine the carbon content in CoFe2O4@C. The TGA curve (Fig. S4†) showed that the weight ratio of carbon in CoFe2O4@C was approximately 10.3 wt%. In addition, the electric conductivity was measured by a four-point probe method. As shown in Fig. S5,† the average electrical conductivity of CoFe2O4 under the pressure from 4 to 30 MPa was only 4.24 × 10−5 S cm−1, whereas CoFe2O4@C exhibited a high average electrical conductivity of up to 2.38 S cm−1. Clearly, the presence of the carbon layer can improve the electric conductivity of the host material, thus increasing the electron-transfer capacity and the kinetic performance of the cathode.
XPS was employed to further confirm the surface composition and chemical state of CoFe2O4@C. The wide-survey XPS spectrum revealed the predominant presence of Fe, Co, O, and C elements (Fig. S6†). The high-resolution Co 2p spectrum is presented in Fig. 2a. The peaks at 780.0 and 795.3 eV are related to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbitals of Co3+,31 and the peaks at 781.2 and 796.2 eV correspond to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbitals of Co2+.32 Similarly, as shown in Fig. 2b, the Fe 2p peaks at 712.9 and 725.0 eV were assigned to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbitals of Fe3+,33 while another two peaks at 710.8 and 722.8 eV were associated with 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbitals of Fe2+.34 As displayed in Fig. 2c, the observed O 1s spectrum could be devoluted into three oxygen species. Lattice oxygen (OI) represents Co–O and Fe–O bonds with the binding energy of 529.9 eV.35,36 Chemical adsorbed oxygen (OII) was related with the binding energy of 531.3 eV and the hydroxyl and/or carbonate species on the surface (OIII) were associated with the higher binding energy.37 The binding energy peaks of the C 1s spectrum (Fig. 2d) at 284.8, 286.2, and 289.0 eV could be attributed to C–C, C–O, and OC bonds, respectively.38 These results further verified the successful preparation of the CoFe2O4@C, which is consistent with the above analyses. The specific surface area and pore-size distribution of the CoFe2O4@C nanocages were analyzed by the BET and BJH methods according to N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms.39 The as-obtained CoFe2O4@C nanocages possessed a high surface area with 176.1 m2 g−1 and a mesoporous structure (Fig. S7†).

After loading sulfur into the CoFe2O4 and CoFe2O4@C nanocages, the intense features in the XRD patterns confirmed the presence of sulfur in the S/CoFe2O4 and S/CoFe2O4@C composites (Fig. 2e). The sharp peaks with 2θ at 15.4°, 23.1°, 25.8°, and 34.1° were assigned to the (113) (222), (026), and (137) reflections of α-S (JCPDS no. 78-1889), while the weak diffraction peak with 2θ at 35.4° corresponded to the (311) reflection of CoFe2O4 (JCPDS card no. 22-1086). Both the CoFe2O4 and carbon were stable in an Ar atmosphere, whereas the sulfur will vaporize when heated in an Ar atmosphere. Therefore, the TGA of S/CoFe2O4@C was employed under Ar to determine the sulfur content in S/CoFe2O4@C. As shown in Fig. 2f, the sulfur content in the S/CoFe2O4@C composite was about 74.3 wt%. Meanwhile, the morphology of the S/CoFe2O4@C was fairly well maintained, while slight sulfur appeared outside of the nanocage (Fig. 3a). Specifically, the selective breakage of S/CoFe2O4@C in Fig. S8† indicated that the sulfur had been encapsulated into the CoFe2O4@C nanocage host. Fig. 3b shows that the obtained CoFe2O4@C nanocages structure had turned into a non-empty state with the abundance of sulfur. The element mappings (Fig. 3c) demonstrated the existence and homogeneous distribution of Co, Fe, O, C, and S elements in the S/CoFe2O4@C composite, which is in agreement with the results from the XRD, SEM, and TEM analyses, further confirming the encapsulation of sulfur in the CoFe2O4@C nanocage host.

Electrochemical performances of the S/CoFe2O4@C electrode
The electrochemical performances of the S/CoFe2O4@C were evaluated for its use as a cathode material for Li–S batteries. In comparison, batteries with S/CoFe2O4 as the cathode were also prepared.
As shown in Fig. 4a, the CV curves of the S/CoFe2O4@C electrode were investigated for the first three cycles. During the cathodic reduction process, the peak located at 2.25 V was assigned to the transformation of sulfur (S8) to long-chain LiPS, while the stronger cathodic peak at 2.02 V conformed to the reduction of long-chain LiPS to insoluble Li2S2/Li2S.40 While the peak at 2.45 V in the anodic oxidation process corresponded to the reversible transformation of Li2S to LiPS and further to S8,41 there was no obvious change during the subsequent curves, indicating the relatively good capacity retention and highly reversible redox reactions.
 Fig. 4  (a) CV curves of the S/CoFe2O4@C electrode measured in a potential range of 1.7–2.8 V versus Li/Li+ at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1; (b) rate performance and (c) cycling performance at 0.5C of the S/CoFe2O4 and S/CoFe2O4@C electrode; (d) long-term cycling performance at 2C and the corresponding coulombic efficiency of the S/CoFe2O4@C electrode. 
The rate performances of the S/CoFe2O4@C cathode at various current densities from 0.2 to 2C every 10 cycles can be seen in Fig. 4b. The cell with the S/CoFe2O4@C cathode could deliver discharge capacities of 1191, 924, 794, and 673 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2C, respectively. Importantly, the discharge capacity could be recovered to 969 mA h g−1 when the current density gradually recovered to 0.2C, reflecting an excellent rate capability. On the other hand, when cycled at 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2C, the discharge capacities were 1076, 753, 583, and 475 mA h g−1 for the S/CoFe2O4 cathode. As the current density turned back to 0.2C, the discharge capacity of the S/CoFe2O4 cathode returned to 798 mA h g−1. It is clear that the rate capability of the S/CoFe2O4@C cathode was much superior to the S/CoFe2O4 cathode, which could be attributed to a low polarization during the varied current densities for the S/CoFe2O4@C cathode. The excellent electrical conductivity of the carbon layer in CoFe2O4@C enabled fast electron transfer and increased the kinetics of the electrochemical reaction.
Furthermore, the galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) curves of the S/CoFe2O4 and S/CoFe2O4@C cathode at different current densities were investigated for their potential use as cathode materials (Fig. S9†). Interestingly, two typical discharge plateaus and one charge plateau could be observed at various current rates, corresponding to the oxidation and reduction peaks in the CV curves. The discharge capacity according to the GCD voltage profiles at different rates were similar to those values in the rate capability comparison in Fig. 4b. The results also affirmed that the existence of a carbon layer is very helpful to improve the rate capability of the S/CoFe2O4@C cathode.
The cycle behavior of the as-prepared S/CoFe2O4@C cathode in comparison with the S/CoFe2O4 cathode was measured at a constant current density of 0.5C. As shown in Fig. 4c, the electrode retained a capacity of 821 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles with an average capacity decay of 0.26% per cycle. In contrast, the S/CoFe2O4@C cathode presented a discharge capacity of only 609 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, owing to the low inherent electron conductivity.
The long-term cycling performance was investigated at 2C to further evaluate the stability of the S/CoFe2O4@C cathode, which is shown in Fig. 4d. The initial discharge capacity of the electrode was 816 mA h g−1 and a capacity of 557 mA h g−1 was retained after 500 charge/discharge cycles, which corresponded to a low capacity decay rate of 0.063% per cycle. Moreover, the average coulombic efficiency of the S/CoFe2O4@C cathode was maintained at over 98%, indicating the superior long-term cyclic stability. In addition, the morphology of the S/CoFe2O4@C cathode after cycling was observed by SEM (Fig. S10†). The typical shape of the S/CoFe2O4@C was also retained in the electrode, ensuring the excellent electrochemical performance.
Kinetics characterization of LiPS redox reactions in the S/CoFe2O4@C electrode
The lithium-ion diffusion process is also an important factor in the conversion of LiPS for Li–S batteries. In the cathode, soluble LiPS emerged as an intermediate from insoluble sulfur to insoluble Li2S at the electrode/electrolyte interface. If the reaction kinetics of LiPS is sluggish, LiPS species would gradually accumulate, and increase the viscosity of the electrolyte gradually. Therefore, the conversion of LiPS is a crucial step in the electrochemical reaction dynamics of sulfur cathodes. The electrochemical reaction kinetics of S/CoFe2O4 and S/CoFe2O4@C electrode were further investigated by a series of CV measurements.
As presented in Fig. 5a and b, CV curves of S/CoFe2O4 and S/CoFe2O4@C electrodes were measured at scan rates ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 mV s−1 between 1.7 and 2.8 V. Furthermore, the redox peak currents exhibited a linear relationship with the square root of the scan rate (Fig. 5c–e). The diffusion coefficient of Li+ can be estimated by the Randles–Sevick equation:42Ip = (2.69 × 105)n1.5AD0.5Cv0.5where Ip is the peak current, n is the number of electrons involved in the electrochemical reaction, A is the effective surface area of the electrode, D is the diffusion coefficient of Li+, C is the concentration of Li+ in the electrolyte, and v is the potential scan rate. In general, n, A, and C can be considered as constant in the assembled battery. Hence the slope of the plot (Ip/v0.5) is often used to estimate the diffusion rate of Li+.

(d) Cathodic peak B represents the conversion of LiPS into Li2S2/Li2S. (e) Anodic peak C corresponds to the conversion of LiPS into S8. (f) Nyquist plots of the S/CoFe2O4 and S/CoFe2O4@C electrodes. 
The fitted line plot in Fig. 5c reflects the reduction process of S8 into LiPS, while the plot in Fig. 5d represents the reduction conversion of LiPS into Li2S2/Li2S, and the fitted line plot in Fig. 5e corresponds to the oxidation process of LiPS into S8. The slopes of fitting straight lines are summarized in Table S1.† It was found that the values of S/CoFe2O4@C electrode are higher than those of the S/CoFe2O4@C electrode, which verified the faster Li+ diffusion rate and the faster oxidation–reduction process of LiPS in the S/CoFe2O4@C electrode. The faster kinetic processes of LiPS might be related to the strong adsorption and high electrical conductivity of the CoFe2O4@C nanocages.
In addition, EIS was also employed to investigate the kinetic behavior of the electrode reaction.43 The Nyquist plots of the S/CoFe2O4 and S/CoFe2O4@C electrodes are shown in Fig. 5f. Usually, the intercept of the plot with the real axis at high frequency represents the ohmic resistance. A semicircle appearing in the high-to-medium frequency region corresponds to interface contact resistance and the charge-transfer resistance. According to the comparison of the EIS fitting results for the S/CoFe2O4 and S/CoFe2O4@C electrodes (Table S2†), it is clear that the ohmic resistance of the S/CoFe2O4@C electrode was lower than that of the S/CoFe2O4 electrode (4.5 vs. 6.1 Ω). Also, the charge-transfer resistance of the S/CoFe2O4@C electrode was also less than that of the S/CoFe2O4 electrode (100.8 vs. 153.9 Ω). Furthermore, the linear Warburg tail in the low frequency region is related to the Li+ diffusion resistance. The steeper slope of the linear Warburg tail for the S/CoFe2O4@C electrode demonstrated the faster Li+ diffusion process. All of these results document that the CoFe2O4@C nanocages could facilitate efficient charge transport and LiPS redox reactions for the sulfur cathode in Li–S batteries.
Chemical interaction between LiPS and CoFe2O4@C
The picture inset in Fig. 6a exhibits the color contrast of Li2S4 in DOL/DME solution and after being adsorbed by CoFe2O4 and CoFe2O4@C for 12 h. Clearly there is no big difference in terms of the adsorption capability to the LiPS between CoFe2O4@C and CoFe2O4, which is evidenced by the colorless liquid after adsorption. The UV-vis absorption spectra presented in Fig. 6a further indicate that the CoFe2O4@C nearly had the same strong chemisorption capability to LiPS compared with CoFe2O4.

(b) Co 2p, (c) Fe 2p, (d) O 1s high resolution XPS comparative analysis of CoFe2O4@C before and after interacting with Li2S4 solution. (e) Li 1s, (f) S 2p high resolution XPS analysis of CoFe2O4@C after interacting with Li2S4 solution. 
In order to detect the nature of the interaction between CoFe2O4@C and LiPS, the surface chemistry of the deposit was further investigated by XPS. In the high-resolution Co 2p3/2 spectrum of the initial CoFe2O4@C, there were two peaks with the core level binding energies at 780.0 and 795.3 eV, corresponding to Co3+. After the adsorption of Li2S4, the peaks of Co3+ and Co2+ were shifted to a lower binding energy (Fig. 6b). Meanwhile, the ratio of Co3+ after adsorption was decreased compared with before interacting with Li2S4. In the high-resolution Fe 2p3/2 spectrum of the inital CoFe2O4@C, the binding energy peaks at 712.9 and 725.0 eV were assigned to Fe3+. Similarly, after being immersed in Li2S4 solution, the peaks of Fe3+ and Fe2+ were also shifted to a lower binding energy, and the ratio of Fe3+ decreased significantly (Fig. 6c). The partially reduced Co3+ and Fe3+ could be attributed to the charge transfer between LiPS and Co/Fe atoms, indicating the existence of a high chemical affinity between them.44 As shown in Fig. 6d, the Li–O bond at the binding energy of 531.6 eV appeared on the surface of CoFe2O4@C after interacting with Li2S4 solution, suggesting the potential adsorption capacity of CoFe2O4@C to LiPS.45 Meanwhile, the Li 1s spectrum also provides proof that Li–O bonds really existed (Fig. 6e).
Furthermore, polysulfides adsorption was also investigated by the high-resolution S 2p spectrum (Fig. 6f). The peaks at 163.0 and 164.6 eV revealed the existence of bridging sulfur (S0B), and the peaks at 161.5 and 163.6 eV were attributed to the terminal sulfur (ST−1). The peaks at 166.8 and 168.4 eV were associated with thiosulfate, and the peaks at 167.5 and 170 eV were assigned to the polythionate. These polythionate species are viewed as mediators to promote the conversion reaction of sulfur-related species on the surface of the polar material.46
Conclusions
In summary, we propose CoFe2O4@C nanocages as an effective encapsulation material for the sulfur cathode in Li–S batteries, with polar CoFe2O4 as the inner shell and an ultrathin carbon layer as the outer shell. Typically, the hollow structure offers sufficient empty space to accommodate the volume change during cycling, and improves the stability of the electrode. Meanwhile, the CoFe2O4 provides adequate physical and chemical adsorption sites for anchoring LiPS. Furthermore, the carbon layer on the surface of the nanocage elevated the electrical conductivity and the electron-transfer rate in the cathode. Thanks to the unique structural features and compositional superiorities, S/CoFe2O4@C cathodes exhibited a high reversible capacity, superior rate performance, and long-term cycling stability. This work provides a promising strategy to explore high–performance transition metal oxides as efficient sulfur hosts for Li–S batteries.
