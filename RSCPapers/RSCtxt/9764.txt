    , Accepted 30th August 2011First published on 28th September 2011AbstractA facile and scalable process for the in situ formation of Fe3O4 nanocrystals in a pre-formed carbon foam (CF) (Fe3O4/CF) was developed, which involved impregnation of an aqueous iron nitrate solution onto CF followed by controlled thermal treatment in an inert atmosphere. N2adsorption/desorption and BET measurements showed that the CF was a mesoporous carbon with a high pore volume and specific surface area. Transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction measurement, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that 5–50 nm Fe3O4 nanocrystals at a high loading of 78.7 wt% were formed preferentially in the confined pores of CF. When tested for anode material in a Li ion half-cell, the Fe3O4/CF composite was far superior to unsupported Fe3O4 nanocrystals, exhibiting significantly improved Coulombic efficiencies and cycling stability and achieving >780 mA h g−1 after 50 deep charge–discharge cycles with >95% cycling efficiency.
Introduction
With a wide range of potential applications in portable electronics, transportations, and energy storage for intermittent renewable energy sources (e.g. solar and wind powers), the lithium ion battery (LIB) is regarded as the most promising rechargeable energy storage technology.1–3 The current generation of LIBs is based on electrode materials in which Li is stored by insertion between structural layers during charging and extracted from the layers during discharging without significant structural change, which gives excellent cycling performance. However, this insertion mechanism limits Li ion storage to no more than one Li per 3d metal for the cathode or one Li per C6carbon for the anode.4–6 In recent years, 3d-transition-metal binary compounds MxXy (M = Co, Fe, Ni, Cu, etc.; X = F, O, S, N, etc.) that could store Livia the “conversion reaction” have been proposed as alternate electrode materials for LIBs.4,6,7 These materials can have specific capacities as high as ∼1000 mA h g−1 since two to eight Li ions can be stored per formula unit by the “conversion reaction” process in which full utilization of all the oxidation states of a high-valance transition-metal compound can be achieved.
Among these, nanostructures of iron oxides, such as hematite (α-Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4), have been extensively studied as potential anode materials. These materials have higher theoretical capacities (1004 mA h g−1 for α-Fe2O3 and 924 mA h g−1 for Fe3O4) than conventional graphite (372 mA h g−1), low toxicity, and are abundant. In addition, the potential of iron oxide-based anode is higher than that of graphite, which reduces the safety concerns of metallic lithium plating during rapid charge and minimizes unwanted side reactions with the electrolyte.8,9 When coupled with the higher intrinsic densities, iron oxides (5.17–5.24 g cm−3vs. 2.16 g cm−3 for graphite) offer about six times higher volumetric capacity than graphite, which is another big advantage for smaller battery packs. Recently, Hassoun et al.10 have demonstrated a novel battery that can be cycled several hundred times using a LiFePO4 cathode and a bulk iron oxide (Fe2O3) anode of a matching capacity.
The electrochemical reaction of Li with iron oxides is shown in reactions (1) and (2).11 The reverse reaction, that is, reaction of Li2O with Fe, was demonstrated to be feasible for nano-sized particles by Poizot et al.4 As a result, different types of nanostructured iron oxides were synthesized and tested, including nanoparticles,8,12,13 rods and wires,5,14–16 hollow structures,17,18nanotubes,19 flowers20,21 using various synthesis techniques, such as hydrothermal,12,13,16,21,22 soft and hard templating,14,17–19 microwave assisted sol–gel,23electrodeposition and electrospinning techniques.5,24 Fe2O3 + 6Li+ + 6e− ↔ 2Fe0 + 3Li2O(1) Fe3O4 + 8Li+ + 8e− ↔ 3Fe0 + 4Li2O(2)
However, the use of iron oxides in LIB anodes is hampered by the poor electronic conductivity (hematite) and fast capacity fading resulting from severe aggregation of iron oxide particles and large volume variation that inherently accompanies the conversion reaction process.8,16,25 Although these problems can be partly addressed by fabricating nanostructured iron oxides/carbon composites,8,13,17,26 large-scale synthesis of purified iron oxide nanostructures is often time consuming and costly, and it is hard to disperse homogeneously these high-surface energy nanostructures in a conductive matrix such as carbon. The poor thermal stability of iron oxide nanostructures limits any preparation procedure to below 600 °C, which in turn requires careful choice of carbon precursors for any carbon coatings and much prolonged time of carbonization to render moderate electrical conductivity of the coating.13,16,24
Herein we report a facile and scalable strategy to prepare homogeneously dispersed Fe3O4 nanocrystals directly in a porous, conducting, pre-formed carbon foam (CF). This bottom-up, in situ synthesis approach generates Fe3O4 nanocrystals selectively in the confined pores of mesoporous CF, eliminates the need to separately prepare iron oxide nanostructures and additional steps of coating or hybridization with carbon, and alleviates the concern of low conductivity of the iron oxide–carbon composite. The simple strategy makes use of aqueous Fe(NO3)3 solutions and drying and thermal treatment in an Ar flow. As an anode material for LIBs, the as-prepared Fe3O4/CF exhibited very high reversible capacity (950 mA h g−1 at C/10) and remarkably enhanced cycling performance compared with conventionally fabricated electrodes with Fe3O4 nanocrystals.
Experimental
Materials and reagents

Resorcinol (≥99.0%), formaldehyde (∼37 wt% in H2O), ethylene glycol (EG) and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (≥98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and Na2CO3 (≥99.5%) and HF(48 wt% in H2O) were purchased from Junsei Chemical. Silica nanoparticles (80 nm) were purchased from Nanostructured & Amorphous Materials Inc., USA. All chemicals were used as received.
Preparation of CF, Fe3O4 nanocrystals and Fe3O4/CF
A mesoporous CF was prepared from the resorcinol–formaldehyde carbon-gel system using 80 nm silica nanoparticles as the template.27,28Silica template (2.13 g) was dispersed in DI water (29 mL) in a glass vial. Resorcinol (0.92 g), formaldehyde (1.38 mL) and sodium carbonate solution (0.83 mL of 0.2 M) were added into the silica solution. The mixture was stirred and heated at 90 °C to form a gel. The gel was further aged at 90 °C overnight and thoroughly washed and filtered with water. The dried gel was heated to 800 °C in a tube furnace in Ar (50 mL min−1) flow and maintained at 800 °C for 2 h. The composite was treated with HF (15.0 wt%), thoroughly washed and filtered with water to give the final mesoporous CF.
An amount of Fe precursor solution (1.4 M of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O in DI water), equivalent to the pore volume of CF determined by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurement, was impregnated onto CF and the Fe-impregnated/CF was dried at 80 °C in air overnight. This process was repeated three times to impregnate the desired amount of Fe on CF (denoted as Fe(NO3)3/CF). After drying, the sample was heated in Ar flow (50 cm3 min−1) to 450 °C at 10 °C min−1 rate and maintained at 450 °C for 2 h to form Fe3O4 in the confined pores of the pre-formed CF (denoted as Fe3O4/CF) (Scheme 1). For a comparative study, Fe3O4 nanocrystals were synthesized by the hydrothermal method in the literature.13 In a typical synthesis, 0.804 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was dissolved in 10 mL of EG in a 20 mL glass vial. The vial was placed into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave containing 12 mL of ammonia solution. The autoclave was sealed and heated to 180 °C and kept at that temperature for 12 h. After cooling, the solid was purified by washing with DI water and centrifugation for three times, followed by drying at 80 °C overnight for electrochemical tests.

Characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples were recorded on an Ultima IV, Rigaku model D/MAX-50 kV system (Cu-Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å). The morphologies of samples were investigated by using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-35CF operated at 10.0 kV) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010 operated at 200.0 kV). X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo Electron Corporation spectrometer with an Al Kα = 300.0 eV excitation source. The pore volume, pore size, and surface area of CF were determined with N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm measurement on a Micromeritics AS1-A4 system at liquid nitrogen temperature. The carbon content in Fe3O4/CF was determined by weight loss in a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) run to 800 °C at the ramping rate of 10 °C min−1 in an air flow, after correcting for the oxidation of Fe3O4 to Fe2O3.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical tests were conducted using Swagelok-type half-cells with Li foil as the counter-electrode. The working electrodes (35–40 μm thick) were prepared by casting a paste consisting of 70 wt% active material (Fe3O4 nanoparticles, Fe3O4/CF composite), 20 wt% Super P Li, and 10 wt% poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder onto a copper foil by doctor blade. A Celgard 2400 polypropylene membrane was used as the separator. 1.0 M LiPF6 in an ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DMC/DEC) mixture (3:4:3 v/v/v) provided by Ukseung Ltd. (Korea) was used as the electrolyte. The cells were assembled in an argon-filled globe box. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were carried out in the potential range of 0.01–3.0 V vs. Li+/Li at 0.1 mV s−1. The cells were galvanostatically cycled in a voltage range of 3.0–0.01 V vs. Li+/Li using a galvanostat/potentiostat system (WonATech, Korea).
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 illustrates the facile and scalable strategy for the in situ formation of Fe3O4 nanocrystals in the confined pores of pre-formed CF. Because iron oxide was not yet present in the CF preparation, there was no limit on the carbonization temperature, and a highly conducting CF could be produced. Successful removal of the silica template was confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), which could not detect the presence of Si (see ESI, Fig. S1†).
The mesopores in the CF were directly observable in the SEM images of CF shown in Fig. 1a and b. The high-magnification SEM images in Fig. 1b and S2† indicate the co-existence of small pores generated by the 80 nm SiO2 template as well as large ones derived from their aggregates. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of CF are shown in Fig. 1c and d, respectively. The hysteresis in the isotherms over the pressure range (p/p0 = 0.4–1.0) indicated the presence of mesopores. The pore size distribution derived from the desorption isotherm showed the preponderance of ∼4 nm mesopores. The BET surface area and total pore volume at p/p0 = 0.9927 were 834 m2 g−1 and 0.87 cm3 g−1, respectively. The high surface area indicated the presence of a significant amount of micropores in CF, generated mainly by carbonization of the resorcinol resin.28

Fig. 2a shows the TEM images of the Fe3O4 nanocrystals synthesized by the hydrothermal method.13 The black, hexagonal Fe3O4 nanocrystals were highly aggregated and their sizes were quite uniform, in the range of 7–15 nm. The lattice d-spacings of 4.70 Å and 2.97 Å corresponding to (111) and (220) planes of Fe3O4,29 respectively, are identified in Fig. 2b. The TEM images of Fe3O4/CF showed that most of the Fe3O4 nanocrystals formed in situ could be found selectively in the confined pores of CF grains (Fig. 2c and d). The particle sizes of Fe3O4 nanocrystals were in the range of 5–50 nm, and their morphologies were rather non-uniform compared with those obtained by the hydrothermal method. Some of the large Fe3O4 nanocrystals were present on the external surface of the CF particles as shown in Fig. S4†. Fig. 2d shows the high resolution TEM image of Fe3O4 nanocrystals formed in CF. The measured d-spacing in the lattice image was 2.53 Å, which is in good agreement with that of the (311) plane for bulk Fe3O4.29 The Fe3O4/CF sample showed similar magnetic property as Fe3O4 nanocrystals obtained from hydrothermal synthesis, supporting that Fe3O4 (magnetite) was the dominant phase of iron oxides in the Fe3O4/CF (Fig. S3†).

In order to further identify the nano-phase of the iron oxides, XRD analyses were conducted for Fe3O4 nanocrystals, Fe(NO3)3/CF (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O impregnation on CF followed by drying at 80 °C in air), and Fe3O4/CF samples (Fig. 3a). The XRD patterns of Fe3O4 nanocrystals obtained from hydrothermal synthesis and Fe3O4/CF exhibited diffraction peaks of Fe3O4 nanocrystals which matched well with those of magnetite (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) File Card No. 19-0629). The diffraction peaks of Fe3O4 nanocrystals obtained from hydrothermal synthesis were much broadened compared to those of Fe3O4/CF reflecting the particle size effect. The average particle sizes of Fe3O4 nanocrystals from hydrothermal synthesis and in Fe3O4/CF sample were estimated from the line width of (311) diffraction using the Scherrer's formula, D = 0.89λ/(βcos θ), to be 10.1 and 21.7 nm, respectively, which are in accordance with HRTEM observation. This confirms that Fe3O4 nanocrystals can be formed in situ in the CF by simple impregnation of aqueous solution of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O followed by heat treatment at 450 °C in an Ar flow. In contrast, Cui et al. reported the formation of ∼14.2 wt% metallic iron with a bcc structure in carbon-coated Fe3O4 nanocrystals, where the carbon was derived from heating glucose at 600 °C in nitrogen and surface reduction of Fe3O4 by the carbon matrix occurred.13 In the XRD pattern of Fe(NO3)3/CF (Fig. 3a, (iii)), there were no diffraction peaks assignable to Fe3O4 or Fe2O3. The Fe3O4 content in Fe3O4/CF was determined by TGA analysis up to 800 °C in an air flow. The TGA profile (Fig. 3b) displayed a weight loss from RT to 120 °C due to dehydration followed by a weight gain of 0.71 wt% between 120 °C and 250 °C possibly due to the oxidation of Fe3O4 to Fe2O3.29 The combustion of carbon was complete at a relatively low temperature (<400 °C). From the weight change between 120 °C and 380 °C, the carbon content was determined to be 21.3 wt% and the balance was assumed to be Fe3O4, i.e., 78.7 wt%. Thus, a Fe3O4 content as high as 78.7 wt% can be achieved by this simple process of impregnation followed by thermal treatment due to the highly mesoporous characteristics of CF.

Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectrum of Fe3O4/CF with the high-resolution spectra of Fe2p in the inset. The two Fe peaks with binding energies of 710.6 and 724.4 eV were attributed to Fe2p3/2 and Fe2p1/2, respectively, for trivalent Fe in the Fe3O4.30,31 Hence, from the XRD and XPS analyses, it is evident that the simple process employed here leads to the exclusive formation of the Fe3O4 phase in the pores of CF. The predominant peak located at 284.5 eV was assigned to the characteristic peak of C1s. It was highly symmetric with small amounts of oxygen-containing residues at 288.6 eV in the CF. The peak at 530.6 eV was attributed to O1s of the lattice oxygen of Fe3O4 nanocrystals. In the XPS spectrum of Fe(NO3)3/CF, Fe showed two peaks with binding energies of 710.3 and 724.5 eV, corresponding to trivalent Fe2p3/2 and Fe2p1/2, respectively (Fig. S5†). The O1s peak at 530.71 eV was predominant and a N1s peak was observed at 405.55 eV. The area ratio of N1s to Fe2p3 peak was 1.28, which was much less than 3.0 in Fe(NO3)3. From the XPS analysis, the Fe species in Fe(NO3)3/CF were trivalent and presumably in the formula of Fe(NO3)x(OH)y·zH2O (0 < x < 1.28, x + y = 3).

The electrochemical properties of Fe3O4/CF were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic cycling test with a Li-ion half-cell. The properties were compared with those of unsupported Fe3O4 nanocrystals. Fig. 5a and b show the cyclic voltammetry curves of the Fe3O4 nanocrystals and the Fe3O4/CF for the initial five cycles (Fig. S6† for initial two cycles) in the voltage range between 3.0 and 0.01 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Overall, the voltages for the anodic process (at about 1.7–1.9 V) were much higher than the cathodic ones (0.5–0.7 V) on both electrodes. This large voltage difference (∼1.2 V) has been attributed to the poor kinetics of the heterogeneous reactions involving three solid-state components: Fe3O4, Fe0, and Li2O.4,8 For the Fe3O4 nanocrystals (Fig. 5a), three reduction peaks were observed in the first cathodic process (Fig. S6†). Two small peaks at 1.5 V and 0.85 V could be attributed to the formation of LixFe3O4 intermediates due to Li intercalation,21,32,33 and the third strong spiky peak at 0.55 V could be attributed to the reduction of Fe3+ and Fe2+ to Fe0 and the irreversible reaction of electrolyte to form a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer.21,26,33 In subsequent cycles, the obvious peak at 0.55 V was shifted to 0.64–0.73 V due to electrode polarization, and a new reduction peak appeared at around 1.3 V possibly due to different types of LixFe3O4 in the second cycle onward. However, both the currents and the integrated areas of the two peaks decreased substantially with cycling, indicating capacity loss due to the irreversibility of the electrochemical reaction. In the anodic process, two peaks were recorded at about 1.72 V and 1.85 V, corresponding to the oxidation of Fe0 to Fe2+ and Fe3+, respectively,8,21,25 and their integrated area decreased with cycling. Fig. 5b shows the CV profile of the Fe3O4/CF for the initial five cycles. The major cathodic and the anodic peaks in the first cycle were located at 0.62 V and 1.72/1.85 V, respectively. They were positively shifted during subsequent cycles due to less polarization of the electrode materials compared with the first cycle. The voltage–current curves after the first cycle almost overlapped, indicating an excellent electrochemical reversibility of Fe3O4 nanocrystals encapsulated in CF.

The voltage profiles of Fe3O4 nanocrystals and Fe3O4/CF for the first five cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1 are shown in Fig. 5c and d, respectively. Both the Fe3O4 nanocrystals and the Fe3O4/CF electrodes showed similar first discharge voltage profiles with the long voltage plateau at around 0.8 V versusLi+/Li due to the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe0. The downward sloping voltage curves below 0.8 V are commonly observed with many transition metal oxide anodes.12,32 Since both the Fe3O4 nanocrystals and the Fe3O4/CF electrodes exhibited the first discharge capacities much larger than theoretical capacity of Fe3O4, the downward sloping voltage curves could be ascribed to the combined effects of the formation of SEI layers, the reversible Li storage in the carbon and possibly interfacial lithium storage.8,12 The second discharge curves of both the Fe3O4 nanocrystals and the Fe3O4/CF were different from the first, indicating drastic structural changes in the electrodes due to Li-driven electrochemical reactions as observed in the CV experiments. After the first cycle, the voltage plateau became less apparent. Instead, two sloping regions at 1.6–1.0 V and 1.0–0 V appeared in accordance with CV profiles, and the higher voltage sloping regions could be attributed to Li intercalation into Fe3O4 to form LixFe3O4 intermediates, while the lower to the conversion reaction of Fe3+ and Fe2+ to Fe0.21,24,25,32–34

Fig. 6 shows the cycling performances of Fe3O4 nanocrystals and Fe3O4/CF, tested between 0.01 and 3.0 V at the current density of 100 mA g−1 up to 50 cycles. For Fe3O4 nanocrystals, the first discharge and charge capacities were 1478 and 949 mA h g−1, respectively, resulting in a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 64.2%. The capacities faded rapidly, to below 200 mA h g−1 in 20 cycles (Fig. 6a). In contrast, Fe3O4/CF showed much more stable cycling performance, as shown in Fig. 6b. The first cycle discharge and charge capacities were 1352 and 948 mA h g−1, respectively, giving a CE of 70.1%. The CEs were higher than 95% in subsequent cycles, and a reversible capacity of >920 mA h g−1 was retained after 20 cycles and 784 mA h g−1 even after 50 cycles, which was 83% of its initial reversible capacity. The higher CE for Fe3O4/CF than Fe3O4 nanocrystals was expected for two reasons. First, Fe3O4 nanocrystals obtained from hydrothermal synthesis possess reactive surface hydroxyl groups,31,35 which contribute to the irreversible electrolyte decomposition reaction in the first cycle. On the other hand, the preparation of Fe3O4/CF involved 450 °C treatment in Ar which effectively removed the surface hydroxyl groups on the Fe3O4 nanocrystals and reduced the first cycle capacity loss. The improved cycling performance of Fe3O4/CF in subsequent cycles can be attributed to its structural advantages. The mesopores of CF isolated the Fe3O4 nanocrystals from each other, suppressing their aggregation during the electrochemical process and the volume expansion of ∼180% associated with the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe0 and formation of Li2O was effectively accommodated by the mesoporous CF matrix. The slow capacity fade observed on Fe3O4/CF might be due to some irreversibility of the reaction (2), especially in the relatively large open pores of CF.

The rate capability of Fe3O4/CF was evaluated at various currents in the range of 100–2000 mA g−1 at the cut-off voltage between 0.01 and 3.0 V Li+/Li, and the results are given in Fig. 7. The discharge capacities were retained at ∼870, ∼780 and ∼570 mA h g−1 at a current of 100, 200 and 500 mA g−1, respectively. The capacities at higher currents of 1000 and 2000 mA g−1, however, faded rapidly, and were as low as 140 mA h g−1, indicating rather poor kinetics of electrochemical conversion reaction at high current. However, when the current was restored to 100 mA g−1 after 80 cycles, the Fe3O4/CF still delivered 687 mA h g−1 which was about 78% of the initial capacity.

Thus, we have demonstrated that Fe3O4 nanocrystals can be formed in situ in the pores of pre-formed mesoporous carbons by simple impregnation of Fe(NO3)3 aqueous solution followed by thermal treatment at a moderate temperature in an inert atmosphere. The use of iron nitrate (sulfate form can be used as well) eliminates salt formation and the washing process usually required in wet-synthetic protocols such as hydrothermal synthesis. These initial results of as-prepared Fe3O4/CF showed promising electrochemical properties as high capacity LIB anodes, and further optimization in terms of the texture of the mesoporous carbon (pore size, pore size distribution, etc.), particle size and size distribution of Fe3O4 nanocrystals, density of nanoparticles in the composite, etc., is expected to influence its electrochemical performances. The simple, facile, low-cost, and scalable strategy explored in this study can be extended to prepare other metal oxide MxOy (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, etc.)/C nanocomposites, which may have high potentials for high capacity LIB anodes.
Conclusions
In summary, a facile and scalable process was successfully demonstrated for the synthesis of Fe3O4 nanocrystals embedded in a mesoporous carbon matrix, which involves simple impregnation of an iron oxide precursor (Fe(NO3)3) in an aqueous solution into a pre-formed mesoporous carbon foam (CF) followed by thermal treatment at moderate temperature in an Ar flow. The superior electrochemical performance of the Fe3O4 nanocrystal/carbon composites compared with unsupported Fe3O4 nanocrystals confirms the advantages of physical separation of domains of storage materials to prevent their agglomeration and the consequential capacity fading upon cycling. It also demonstrates the potential of the mesoporous carbon foam as a desirable support for high performance electrode composites. These low cost materials and processing make them attractive candidates for further optimization and evaluation for commercial viability.
