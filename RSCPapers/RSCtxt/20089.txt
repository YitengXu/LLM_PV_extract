Faraday Discuss. Chem. Soc., 1986, 82, 251-260Vibrational predissociation of the nitric oxide dimer(Note: The full text of this document is currently only available in the PDF Version )Michael P. Casassa, John C. Stephenson and David S. KingAbstractDetails of experimental measurements of the total energy distribution and time dependence of the vibrational predissociation of the nitric oxide dimer excited to ν1 are presented. Energy-disposal measurements indicated the fragments are described by an average rotational energy 〉ER〈= 75 cm–1, full equilibration of the lambda doublet species, approximately equal populations in both spin-orbit states, no significant degree of alignment, an isotropic flux distribution and an average kinetic energy of 〉EK〈= 400 cm–1 per fragment. Although ca. 75% of the available energy went into the fragment translation, the predissociation proceeded at a rate > 108 s–1.
