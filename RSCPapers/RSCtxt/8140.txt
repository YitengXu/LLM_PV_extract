    , Accepted 15th July 2013First published on 17th July 2013AbstractTwo acceptor–donor type conjugated small molecules based on isoindigo and thienoisoindigo acceptor units are synthesized. The small molecules showed broad and low-energy light absorption properties. On application of the small molecules in organic photovoltaic cells, thienoisoindigo-based small molecule in combination with PC71BM showed moderate photovoltaic efficiency with a PCE of 1.51% with an open-circuit voltage of 0.72 V under AM 1.5 solar irradiation.
Donor–acceptor (D–A) type alternating conjugated polymers have been intensively investigated over the last decade, leading to considerable improvements in polymer solar cell performance.1 In contrast, conjugated small molecules for printable solar cells have received much less attention than polymers for solar cells despite many advantages: small molecules are more easily synthesized and purified, and often have more clearly-defined chemical structures.2 Recently, utilization of classical natural dyes, which exhibit good optical absorption, as building units of conjugated polymers and small molecules is an advantageous strategy to develop new families of organic semiconductors, particularly for organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications.3 Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), a classical dye, has been a useful building block for the D–A type structures: conjugated materials containing the DPP unit often show good semiconductor performance in field-effect transistors (FETs) and strong absorption of light in OPV devices.4 Another classical dye, isoindigo, has also been demonstrated as a potential alternating component in copolymers or as a terminal unit in small molecules for FET and OPV devices.5–7 Very recently, the benzene rings of isoindigo were replaced with thiophenes to form thienoisoindigo based on the concept that thiophene linkage in thienoisoindigo-containing conjugated polymers will enhance planarity along the backbone, inducing further effective conjugation, charge delocalization, and intermolecular π–π interactions. Thienoisoindigo-based copolymers have been thus synthesized and have exhibited good FET performance including an ambipolar character,8 whereas OPV application of the copolymers has never been reported.
In this work we have developed a novel isoindigo thiophene analogue, in which one of the benzopyrrolidone parts of isoindigo is replaced with thienopyrrolidone to form an unsymmetrical structure, for use as a terminal acceptor unit of A–D–A type conjugated small molecules. Since conjugated small molecules consist of a relatively small number of aromatic units, the effective extension of π-conjugation is highly required to achieve a narrow optical gap for OPV application. The synthesized small molecule 1, in conjugation with benzodithiophene as a donor unit, showed a broad absorption feature compared with the corresponding isoindigo-based small molecule 2. Theoretical calculations indicated a planar chemical structure of 1. OPV devices fabricated with 1 showed moderate photovoltaic performances.
The synthesis routes for the conjugated small molecules 1 and 2 are shown in Schemes 1 and 2, respectively. Key intermediates for their synthesis are unsymmetrically substituted isoindigo derivatives A and D. Although several different ways are possible to synthesize isoindigo structure, it has been reported that N-alkylation of unsymmetrical isoindigo derivatives under basic conditions causes a disproportionation reaction.7a Thus, compounds A and D were prepared by a selective hetero-coupling reaction of the corresponding N-alkylated half units. As shown in Scheme 1, a novel isoindigo analogue was prepared from the reaction of N-octylthienopyrole-2,3-dione and N-octyl-1H,3H-indole-2-one in refluxing acetic acid for 48 h (full synthetic details in ESI†).5–7 Succeeding selective monobromination of the thienopyrrolidone unit was successfully achieved using NBS in THF solution to form A in a good yield, whereas an undesired dibrominated compound was obtained in 35% yield using DMF as the solvent. The A–D–A type conjugated small molecule 1 was synthesized by Stille coupling of the monobromo compound A and a bis(trimethylstannyl)-benzodithiophene derivative in 74% yield as a greenish-black solid. Compound 1 has excellent solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, THF, and ethyl acetate.

As shown in Scheme 2, conjugated small molecule 2 containing isoindigo terminal units was similarly synthesized by Stille coupling between the monobrominated isoindigo derivative (D) and bis(trimethylstannyl)benzodithiophene in 72% yield. It is notable that compound D was prepared from N-alkylated bromoisatin (6-bromo-1H-indole-2,3-dione) C and N-alkylated 1H,3H-indole-2-one in acetic acid at reflux temperature. When compound D was synthesized from a coupling reaction of 6-bromoisatin and 1H,3H-indole-2-one,5–7 followed by alkylation of the NH groups using the alkyl halide under basic conditions, the rearranged by-products, N,N′-dialkylisoindigo and 6,6′-dibromo- N,N′-diakylisoindigo, were also obtained with the reported ratio.7a On the other hand, our synthetic route gave only the desired monobromo compound D, which was isolated in a good yield by simple column chromatography and crystallization.

Fig. 1 shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of compounds 1 and 2 in chloroform solution and spin-cast film. In solution, both the compounds exhibit multi-band nature and the strong longest-wavelength absorption maxima reaching 655 nm (ε = 48000 M−1 cm−1) for small molecule 1 and 564 nm (ε = 40000 M−1 cm−1) for compound 2. The absorption onset in solutions is observed at 735 nm for 1 and 663 nm for 2, which correspond to optical energy gaps of 1.68 and 1.87 eV, respectively. These absorptions are further shifted to longer wavelengths in film. Compound 1 therefore showed good absorption of the visible spectrum, which is often observed in such D–A type polymer materials.6,9 Although the absorption of compound 2 is somewhat inferior to that of 1, it also appeared broader than other common donor polymers used in OPV devices such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). In addition, the optical gaps (1: 1.49 and 2: 1.71 eV) for film absorbance are narrower than those of many polymers containing isoindigo as an acceptor unit.5–7 Thus conjugated small molecule 1 had blue appearance and 2 appeared violet.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the conjugated small molecules and the acceptor units were conducted using Gaussian (B3LYP/6-31G level) program. As shown in Fig. 2, the calculated HOMO and LUMO of molecule 1 are mostly distributed along the backbone, whereas molecule 2 show more localization of the HOMO on the benzodithiophene (BDT) and the LUMO on the isoindigo moiety, indicating a less conjugation between the two moieties. The HOMO energy level of molecule 1 is higher than that of 2, which is consistent with the calculated HOMO levels of the terminal acceptor units (Fig. S2, ESI†). On the other hand, the LUMO level of 1 is slightly lower than that of 2 in spite of the higher LUMO level of thienoisoindigo than that of the isoindigo unit. This inconsistency may be attributed to a subtle balance between effective conjugation of thienoisondigo in conjugated small molecule 1 and stronger electron affinity of the indigo unit. Thus, the calculated HOMO and LUMO energies suggest that molecule 1 should have a narrower optical gap than molecule 2 does, consistent with the estimation from the measured UV–vis absorption spectra. An optimized structure of molecule 2 in Fig. 2 featured a twisted conformation with dihedral angle of 22.7° between thiophene ring of BDT and benzene ring of the benzopyrrolidone unit. By replacing the benzene ring with thiophene, the dihedral angle of molecule 1 was reduced (7.3°) to give nearly planar backbone conformation. The planar structure allows delocalization of the frontier molecular orbitals, an expansion of effective π-conjugation, and thus a red-shift of the absorption, achieving a broad absorption feature in compound 1. These results highlight the effectiveness of the thienopyrrolidone unit for red-shifting absorption to generate narrow optical gap materials.

The redox behavior of the conjugated small molecules 1 and 2 was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in dichloromethane and the voltammograms are shown in Fig. 3. Both the conjugated small molecules exhibited two quasi-reversible oxidation waves and a reversible reduction wave. On the basis of the electricity of each wave, the reduction wave involves twice more electrons than that in each oxidation process. The half-wave potentials (E1/2s) of first oxidation and reduction for compound 1 were 0.38 and −1.35 V, respectively, whereas those for compound 2 were shifted to positive potentials and observed at 0.45 and −1.28 V, respectively. The CV of the isoindigo precursors A and D was also measured for comparison with the conjugated small molecules. As shown in Fig. S3, ESI,† although a reduction peak of compound A was not observed in the measurable potential window, compound D showed a reversible reduction wave and its half-wave potential was −1.26 V, indicating lower LUMO level of compound D than that of A. This result is consistent with the DFT calculations and suggests that the electrochemical LUMO energy levels of the conjugated small molecules correlate with those of the terminal acceptor units.

Fig. 4 shows an estimated energy diagram of the conjugated small molecules 1 and 2 together with PC61BM, which is a typical acceptor material in OPV devices. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated using the values determined from the redox potentials based on the equation; Energy level = −(4.8 + E1/2) eV.10 The reduction potential of PC61BM was measured under the same conditions (Fig. 3). The HOMO energy levels of the conjugated small molecules are located at an appropriate level to potentially give a high open circuit voltage (Voc) with PC61BM in a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OPV device. It has been reported that an offset value (ΔE) of 0.3 eV between the donor and acceptor LUMO energies is required for efficient charge separation in a BHJ system.11 The LUMO energy level of the compound 1 was located at −3.45 eV giving a 0.22 eV offset value from the LUMO level of PC61BM (−3.67 eV). The LUMO energy of compound 2 was slightly lower than that of 1, giving an offset value of about 0.15 eV. These low offset values are likely to contribute to undesirably poor charge separation in a blend of the conjugated small molecules and PC61BM.

Thermal properties of conjugated materials are an important aspect for organic electronic device fabrication. Thermal analyses of the conjugated small molecules 1 and 2 were carried out by thermogravimetric analysis, which, as shown in Fig. S4, ESI,† revealed that the decomposition temperature at 5% weight loss of compounds 1 and 2 are to be 347 and 350 °C, respectively, under an inert atmosphere. The high thermal stability of the conjugated small molecules indicates the suitability of the materials as active layers of organic electronic devices.
In order to investigate potentials of the conjugated small molecules 1 and 2 for photovoltaic device applications, the BHJ photovoltaic cells were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/small molecule: PCBM(1:2)/Ca/Al. As feared from the small LUMO energy offset in Fig. 4, the devices fabricated from compound 2 did not show any photovoltaic response. On the other hand, OPV devices based on compound 1 showed photovoltaic responses, whose J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 5 and photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1.

Using PC61BM as an acceptor material, the device showed a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 3.62 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.70 V, and fill factor (FF) of 0.33, resulting in a power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.83%. The deep HOMO energy level of compound 1 gave rise to a slightly higher Voc than that of a typical P3HT device (ca. 0.6 V) as reported elsewhere.12 The EQE spectrum of the device clearly showed a broad photo response from 300 to 850 nm covering the whole visible spectrum. This photoresponse is broader than those based on conventional D–A type polymers, which usually range between 300 to 800 nm.6,9,13 Using PC71BM, which possesses stronger visible absorption than PC60BM,14 the Jsc of the device was increased to 4.89 mA cm−2, giving an improvement in PCE to 1.51%.
To obtain insight into the difference between the performances of the OPV devices based on 1 and 2, hole mobility and morphology of the active layers were investigated. The films of compounds 1 and 2 blended with PC71BM showed the same hole mobility of 3.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 measured from the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S6, ESI†), indicating the hole mobility of the donor compounds is not a factor of the drastic difference between the OPV performances. Morphological analyses of the active layers were conducted using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements shown in Fig. S7, ESI.† In the AFM image for the 1–PC71BM blend film, submicrometer-size grain morphology, suggesting nano phase separation desirable for efficient charge separation, was observed (Fig. S7(c), ESI†), whereas the 2–PC71BM blend film exhibited a rough surface with large domains (Fig. S7(d), ESI†). A intense XRD peak observed for the 2–PC71BM blend film indicated that these large domains consist of a highly crystalline structure similar to the film of pristine 2 shown in Fig. S7(b), ESI.† On the other hand, as shown in Fig. S7(c), ESI,† the XRD of 1–PC71BM blend film showed the feature of a rather amorphous nature. The OPV-inactive nature of the 2–PC71BM blend is attributable to these morphological features of the film as well as the low offset value between their LUMO energy levels.
Conclusions
We have synthesized two acceptor–donor–acceptor type conjugated small molecules 1 and 2 containing isoindigo derivatives as terminal units and investigated their performances as OPV donor materials. Depending on the chemical structure of the isoindigo parts, the small molecules clearly showed the different absorption, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties. The broader absorption range was achieved by replacing the benzene ring of isoindigo with thiophene, which induces a structural planarity and thus better effective conjugation. The stronger electron affinity of the isoindigo unit than that of thienoisoindigo results in a deeper LUMO energy level of compound 2. While compound 2-based OPV devices did not show a photocurrent response, devices based on compound 1 showed a moderate photovoltaic performance. These results indicate the advantage of the thienopyrrolidone structural unit for OPV applications. By further molecular design including a choice of appropriate donor units, OPV performances using thienoisoindigo-based conjugated small molecules will be improved.
