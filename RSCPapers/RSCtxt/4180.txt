    , Accepted 5th June 2020First published on 8th June 2020AbstractHeterostructures consisting of tungsten disulfide (WS2) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) have shown longer emission decay life time and significantly quenched fluorescence emission in comparison to pure materials (WS2 and CdS). CdS@WS2 heterostructures also show a significant enhancement in light absorption across the entire visible spectrum with a change in the slope of the absorption edge pertaining to WS2 nanostructures in the heterostructures. This leads to higher number of charge carriers, improved charge separation as well as charge migration from the material surface to the back contact. In photoelectrochemical water splitting, the heterostructures exhibited a twentyfold increase in photocurrent density (0.15 mA cm−2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE in comparison to pristine sulfides. The heterostructures also showed a good reduction ratio of >83% in 120 minutes [Cr(VI) to Cr(III)] in a mixture of Cr(VI)/Ni(II) ions and RhB. Hence, CdS@WS2 heterostructures with improved charge carrier dynamics can find several applications as photocatalysts.
1. Introduction
Semiconductor based photocatalysts gained significant interest in recent years owing to their low cost and high catalytic performance. Over the last few years, atomically thin layered two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)1 have been widely studied owing to the successful application of graphene, another 2D material. They possess a quasi-two-dimensional structure wherein, each layer consists of metal atoms covalently bound to S atoms at the hexagonal sites and the sandwiched adjacent layers are held collectively by weak van der Waals forces. Notable TMDs include molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2) whose electrical properties can be tuned from metallic to semiconducting by modulating their crystal structure or the number of layers.2 Their isostructural properties make them suitable not only for photocatalysis3 but also in a wide variety of energy applications including thin film transistors,4 hybrid supercapacitors,5 metal ion batteries,6–8 and photoelectrochemical water splitting (PEC).6 Specifically, 2D layered materials possess a high specific surface area leading to a large number of active sites which can significantly increase the photoelectrochemical properties.7,8 TMDs are also abundant, inexpensive, possess optimal bandgap and resistant to corrosion in highly active media.1 A recent study has shown that WS2 has superior intrinsic electrical conductivity and higher number of active sites for H2 evolution as compared to MoS2.2 Layered structures of WS2 can be synthesized by various techniques such as exfoliation,9,10 laser drilling,11 chemical vapor deposition,12 hydrothermal processing5 and electrodeposition.13
The most prevalent among the above techniques is the liquid phase exfoliation as it enhances the photocatalytic performance by inducing a high number of active edge sites which promote reactions.10 However, it is not suitable for large scale production because of the low yield. These drawbacks can be overcome by a facile, low-temperature hydrothermal route using surfactants such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), and hexadecyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB) as templates to facilitate synthesis of various WS2 morphologies.14 Particularly, CTAB is used as a shape controller and stabilizer in precursor solution to regulate the formation of different nanostructures. The drawbacks of WS2 include a small bandgap of 1.2 eV,15 and relatively low charge mobility along the c-axis (0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1) making it susceptible to recombination in its bulk form.16 Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is a promising high band gap (2.4 eV) semiconductor17 but undergoes charge carrier recombination and is unstable in aqueous electrolyte due to photocorrosion.
PEC is a compelling technique to convert solar energy to chemical energy by liberating hydrogen potentially without any carbon dioxide emissions.18 PEC is a simple, cost-effective and clean process. Although the focus is on the generation of hydrogen, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the rate-limiting step in the PEC scheme.19 The oxygen evolution electrode (photoanode) is required to generate photocurrents that are on par with solar photon flux at low over potential along with stability.6 Recently, metal oxides and sulfides such as TiO2,20 WO3,21,22 BiVO4,23–25 In2S3 (ref. 26) and SnS2 (ref. 27) have been studied due to their excellent kinetics towards OER. Metal nitrides28 are shown to operate in alkaline electrolytes but their stability in strong acid media remains a huge concern.
The major material properties that influence the PEC performance are their light absorption capability, morphological/structural crystallinity and corrosion resistance. There have been numerous strategies to modify the metal sulfides in order to enhance their photocatalytic activity, especially for hydrogen production.29–36 The performance of various CdS–WS2 composite materials is listed in Table S1 in ESI.† A strategy to enhance visible light absorbance is to tune the charge carrier separation/transportation which can be attained by alteration of band structure, inducing defects, design/development of heterostructures and surface modification. The present study is geared towards the design and development of CdS@WS2 heterostructures for oxygen evolution reaction.
WS2 has been used in combination with other materials to synthesize composites such as WS2/MoS2,37,38 WS2/WO3,11 WS2/carbon dot39 and WS2/CN39 with improved HER activity. Danyun et al. demonstrated a significant (26-fold) enhancement in H2 production using a WS2/CdS hybrid in comparison to pristine CdS.40 Chen et al. fabricated a combination of ZnS and WS2/CdS composites with increased photo catalytic performance.41 Although, there are several studies using WS2/CdS hybrids for HER, there is only one study on the use of WS2/CdS heterojunction materials for photocatalytic oxygen evolution, to the best of our knowledge. Zirak et al.42 reported a study of WS2 nanosheets on CdS nanoparticles with a photocurrent density of 0.274 mA cm−2 under 3 W Xe lamp light illumination, which is about three times than that of pure CdS. However, the study does not present sweep voltammetry, chronoamperometry and voltage decay studies.
Photocatalytic reduction is a promising technique to treat aqueous chromium(VI)43 and rhodamine B (RhB) solutions.44,45 Cr oxidation states range from +2 to +6 but the most commonly encountered valences are tri and hexavalent.46 Cr(VI) compounds and RhB emerge as wastes from leather making, dyeing, electroplating, paper industry, textiles;47 are discharged into water bodies which are detrimental to the environment and can potentially enter the food chain. High toxicity as well as high mobility in water makes Cr(VI) a vital water pollutant which is regulated by several countries.48 Therefore, economic and efficient treatment of Cr(VI) in water has attracted intense interest worldwide. Several strategies such as conventional chemical reduction (using reducing agents like sodium hydrogen sulfite, sodium pyrosulfite, hydrazine hydrate), electrochemical precipitation, ion exchange and reverse osmosis have been used to remove Cr(VI) and RhB from water. However, they require a large quantity of reducing agents which is an environmental risk, uneconomical49 and slow. Cr(VI) in water can be converted to Cr(III) which can be precipitated in neutral or alkaline media and removed as solid Cr(OH)3. RhB in water is oxidized to CO2 and H2O. Photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction and RhB oxidation can present viable pathways with the use of ever available solar energy with no emissions.48 Metal sulfides like SnS2,48 Ag2S,46 CdS50etc. have been used as photocatalysts with CdS receiving significant attention but its toxicity is a huge concern.51
In the present work, we discuss PEC properties of CdS@WS2 heterostructures as photoanodes for water splitting and photocatalysts for Cr(VI) reduction and RhB oxidation. The physical and electrochemical assessment in this study showed that WS2 nanostructures (a mix of nanosheets and nanorods) well embedded with CdS nanospheres show significantly improved charge carrier dynamics and properties.
2. Experimental methods
2.1. Chemicals
Sodium tungstate (Na2WO4·2H2O), thioacetamide (CN2H4S, N 99%), hexadecyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB), cadmium acetate dihydrate (Cd(CH3COO)2), sodium sulfide (Na2S, N 98%), anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, N 99%), and potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) are purchased from Merck. The above chemical reagents are of analytical grade and used without further purification. Flourine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates (resistivity: 15 Ω cm) are purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
2.2. Synthesis of WS2 nanostructures
Hydrothermal synthesis of WS2 is carried out14 with slight modifications. Sodium tungstate (0.63 mmol) and excess of thioacetamide (15.7 mmol) are dissolved in distilled water in a Teflon vessel. Hexadecyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide (0.26 mmol) is then added as a surfactant to the above solution and stirred for 30 min. The Teflon vessel is sealed inside a stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 200 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h after which it is cooled down to room temperature. Further, the final grey solid precipitate is separated by using a centrifuge operating at 5000 rpm for 5 min accompanied by washing with ultrapure water and ethanol (two times each). Finally, the sample is dried at 50 °C for 12 h in an oven to obtain pure WS2 in powder form.
2.3. Synthesis of CdS@WS2 heterostructures
Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is synthesized over WS2 coated electrode by using successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process. Cd(CH3COO)2 (0.05 M) in methanol as Cd2+ precursor (B1), Na2S (0.05 M) in methanol as S2− precursor (B2) and methanol (B3, B4) beakers are used during the synthesis process. WS2 coated electrode is dipped in B1 at room temperature for 2 min followed by rinsing with methanol (B3) to remove the unabsorbed salt. The electrode is then dipped in B2 at room temperature for 2 min followed by rinsing with methanol (B4). The sample is dried at 60 °C in an oven for 15 minutes for uniform CdS deposition on WS2. This two-step dipping and drying process is defined as one cycle of SILAR. The same electrode is further exposed to 4 more SILAR cycles to form a yellow-orange coloured CdS@WS2 heterostructures (a total of 5 SILAR cycles). FTO substrate is exposed to 5 SILAR cycles with Cd2+ and S2− precursors for pure CdS synthesis. Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the electrode fabrication process. 3 mg WS2 is ground for 15 min in an agate mortar and pestle with a few drops of terpineol and ethanol to obtain a homogeneous paste which is coated by doctor blade technique over a FTO substrate (0.5 cm × 0.5 cm). The solvent is evaporated overnight at 60 °C by drying in an oven. CdS is then deposited on WS2 coated plates as described above, the thickness of which is measured to be ∼10–15 μm. The total amount of CdS@WS2 heterostructure material on FTO is 15 mg: WS2 content is 3 mg and the rest of the 12 mg is estimated to be that of CdS.

2.4. PEC and Cr(VI) reduction measurements
Chronoamperometry (I–t), current vs. potential (I–V) characteristics and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of PEC cells are carried out using a Autolab PGSTAT 302N provided with NOVA software (1.9) in a three electrode configuration using CdS@WS2 heterostructures as working electrode, Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode and a Pt counter electrode. The light source used is a white LED with a power of 100 mW cm−2, equal to 1 sun illumination. Photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction and RhB removal studies are performed in a photo-reactor equipped with a 150 W xenon arc lamp (output power of 100 mW cm−2 at a distance of 5 cm). A UV-vis spectrophotometer is used for all absorbance measurements. K2Cr2O7 is dissolved in deionised water with a dichromate concentration of 33.3 ppm and dichromate to catalyst mass ratio of 1:20. CdS@WS2 heterostructures are added to the solution and stirred for one hour in dark to reach absorption equilibrium. The solution is then transferred to the photoreactor with a 5 mL sample withdrawal at intervals of 20 minutes. The collected solution is centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 minutes, supernatant filtered and tested by UV-vis spectroscopy for absorbance. The experiment is performed for a total duration of 120 minutes. RhB removal is performed similarly with 5 ppm RhB and 0.667 g L−1 of catalyst. Simultaneous reduction of Cr(VI) and Ni(II) with RhB oxidation is performed at 33.3 ppm, 5 ppm and 100 ppm of Cr(VI), RhB and Ni(II), respectively along with 0.667 g L−1 of CdS@WS2 heterostructures.
2.5. Physical characterization
The absorption measurements of the samples are performed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Labtronics LT 2700). Photoluminescence (PL) and time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) are performed by a Horiba Flouromax-4 fluorescence spectrometer; a suitable filter is utilized for the measurement and background correction is applied. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns are recorded using a PANalytical X'PertPRO instrument with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 E) radiation. Bruker Senterra dispersive Raman microscope spectrometer with a laser excitation wavelength of 532 nm is used for collecting Raman data. Surface morphology is characterised using a scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM-JSM 78100F). A transmission electron microscope (HRTEM JEOL JEM 2100) with LaB6 filament operating at 200 kV is used for high resolution imaging.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Optical characteristics and charge carrier dynamics
UV-vis spectra presented in Fig. 2(a) show two distinct absorption edges of 350 nm for WS2 and 570 nm for CdS in their individual spectra which correspond to an indirect band gap of 1.35 eV and a direct band gap of 2.4 eV, respectively. All the band gap calculations are presented in ESI.† One of the notable features in the spectrum of CdS@WS2 heterostructures is the significant enhancement in light absorption across the entire spectrum leading to increased number of charge carriers. A slight red shift in the absorption peak and a change in the slope of the absorption edge pertaining to WS2 in the heterostructures is ascribed to charge delocalisation. This helps in improved charge separation as well as charge migration from the material surface to the back contact. Notably, absorption spectrum of CdS@WS2 heterostructures indicates a diminished peak after 570 nm, symbolic of the absence of other intermediate energy level transitions which primarily arise due to impurities/defects and can possibly act as charge traps.

To investigate the electronic interactions and charge transfer in all the materials, steady state photoluminescence (PL) is studied at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and shown in Fig. 2(b). All the spectra indicate fluorescence emission at a peak of 420 nm but the CdS@WS2 heterostructures show a significantly quenched fluorescence emission in comparison to other nanostructures which is a result of inhibited electron–hole recombination and a distinct indication of better light transmission properties. Time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) is employed to determine the charge carrier lifetimes in different materials using a 405 nm Nd:YAG laser. TRPL spectra for all three materials are presented in Fig. 2(c). The decay curves are fitted to a triple exponential function consisting of one fast decay process for all three materials (τ1: 0.6–0.65 ns), a slow process for pure materials (WS2 and CdS) (τ2: 2.22–2.58 ns) and another slow process for all three materials (τ3: 9.22–33.62 ns). The only exception is the fast decay second process in CdS@WS2 heterostructures with a τ2 of 0.43 ns. The calculated average emission decay life time 〈τ〉 for CdS@WS2 heterostructures is 14.50 ns which is relatively high in comparison to pristine WS2 (2.51 ns) and CdS (3.05 ns) clearly indicating slow decay of photogenerated charge carriers. The higher emission from CdS@WS2 heterostructures in the inset of Fig. 2(c) is ascribed to the surface charge traps with low emissions. The detailed calculations are presented in the ESI† and the calculated parameters are shown in Table 1. The optical properties reveal that the heterostructures have better light absorption characteristics in the visible spectrum followed by lower charge recombination and thus, have high separation efficiency/long lifetime over pure counterparts.

3.2. Structural and morphological characteristics
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of pristine WS2, CdS and CdS@WS2 heterostructures are shown in Fig. 3(a). XRD pattern of WS2 nanostructures shows prominent diffraction peaks at 26.51°, 43.81° and 51.89° which correspond to (004), (006) and (105) planes of the hexagonal crystal structure of WS2 (JCPDS file number 08-0237). XRD pattern of pristine CdS shows diffraction peaks at 23.39°, 26.82°, 36.03° and 51.8° which correspond to (100), (002), (102) and (112) planes of CdS (JCPDS file number 89-2944). Broad peaks in the XRD spectra are indicative of the nanosized materials. CdS@WS2 heterostructures spectrum shows similar peaks as that of pristine WS2 nanostructures and CdS nanospheres indicating the retention of structure and crystallinity of both materials.

Raman spectrum for WS2 in Fig. 3(b) shows a prominent peak at 265 cm−1 and a weak peak at 403 cm−1 which correspond to E12g (in plane) and A1g (out of plane) vibration modes. The peak at higher wavenumbers of 600 cm−1 corresponds to the LA (M) vibration mode which pertains to the in-plane collective motion of the atoms. The E12g mode corresponds to oscillations of W and S atoms parallel to surface plane while A1g mode represents the oscillation of only S atoms vibrating out of plane wherein, W atoms are static perpendicular to the surface plane. Strong peaks at 300 cm−1 and 600 cm−1 in pristine CdS Raman spectrum correspond to its kesterite phase and indicate the absence of a secondary phase. Raman spectrum of CdS@WS2 heterostructures exhibit the corresponding individual peaks for both CdS nanospheres and WS2 nanostructures indicating the presence of both materials in the heterostructures.
Representative FE-SEM images of pristine WS2, CdS and CdS@WS2 heterostructures coated on FTO substrates at different magnifications are shown in Fig. 3. It can be clearly seen in Fig. 3(c) that pristine WS2 nanostructures have a prevalent mix of nanorods and nanosheets with homogeneous distribution. The length of the nanorods extend over several microns while their widths lie in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 μm. Pure CdS consists of agglomerated spherical nanoparticles as seen in Fig. 3(d). Fig. 3(e) of CdS@WS2 heterostructures demonstrate a radial growth of CdS nanospheres on to WS2 nanorods and the surface growth of CdS on WS2 nanosheets. CdS tends to bind to WS2via van der Waals forces improving adhesion and reducing the charge transfer barrier which in turn improves the photo electrochemical performance of the entire system. The presence of both WS2 nanosheets and nanorods prevent the agglomeration of nanosheets and present highly porous WS2 outlay. Fig. 4 shows the HRTEM images of CdS@WS2 heterostructures. Fig. 4(a) is an image of WS2 nanostructures consisting of both nanorods and nanosheets while Fig. 4(b) shows a d-spacing of 0.34 nm that corresponds to the (004) plane of WS2. Fig. 4(c) shows the nanospheres of CdS with an average diameter of 30 nm. Fig. 4(d) indicates the lattice fringes of CdS with a d-spacing of 0.36 nm that correspond to (100) plane. WS2 nanostructures and CdS nanospheres are distinctly marked in Fig. 4(e) showing different architectures for the materials. The lattice spacing indicated in Fig. 4(f) offers a clear distinction between both the materials. The SAED pattern in the inset of Fig. 4(f) shows diffuse rings which are characteristic of the crystalline nature of WS2 nanostructures and CdS nanospheres. The SAED image in Fig. S2 (ESI†) indicates the presence of two sets of diffuse rings with diffraction spots. The outer diffuse ring corresponds to (100) plane of CdS and (004) plane of WS2 (calculated based on the d-spacing). The stacking between CdS and WS2 is clearly seen in the inner set of diffuse rings which correspond to WS2 (002)‖CdS (001). TEM images clearly indicate a homogeneous distribution of CdS nanospheres on WS2 nanostructures indicating good intimate contact between them which helps in efficient charge separation and migration. Furthermore, the TEM images indicate a continuous nature of the heterostructures with hardly any visible discrete entities of the two materials. The porosity of the pristine WS2 nanostructures allows CdS nanospheres to deposit inside the pores along the whole thickness and hence, highly homogeneous nature of the heterostructures is obtained as indicated by the physical characterization.

3.3. Electron transfer mechanism and PEC performance

Fig. 5(a) indicates the charge transfer mechanism associated with CdS@WS2 heterostructures for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in PEC. The band edges EVB and ECB of WS2 are −6.21 eV and −4.86 eV and that for CdS are −6.38 eV and −3.98 eV, respectively. On exposing the CdS@WS2 heterostructures to visible light irradiation, they generate electron–hole pairs as visible light absorbing semiconductors. Furthermore, CdS donates holes to the valence band of WS2 promoting efficient charge separation which is indicated in Fig. 5(a). The increase in the density of charge carriers along with multiple favourable transition states accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons either from CdS → WS2 → counter electrode and/or CdS → counter electrode. At the anode, photo-induced holes that are transmitted to WS2 drive the water oxidation reaction and prevent the photocorrosion of CdS as no reaction happens on its surface. VB of CdS consists of Cd (4p, 4d) and S (3p) orbitals whereas, CB of CdS consists of S (3s, 3p) and Cd (5s) orbitals.52 WS2 VB consists of W (6s, 5p, 5d) and S (3s, 3p) orbitals whereas, CB has W (5d) and S (3p) orbitals.53 A strong interaction between CdS and WS2 is due to the negative shift of the W (4f) binding energy and the positive shift of Cd (2p) binding energy which change the electron densities and render WS2 as an electron acceptor; CdS act as an electron donor in CdS@WS2 heterostructures.54 The photocurrent densities of pristine CdS, WS2, CdS@WS2 heterostructures measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) under light illumination are presented in Fig. 5(b).
 Fig. 5  (a) Schematic illustration of mechanism of electron transfer in CdS@WS2 heterostructures. (b) LSV curves in dark and light conditions. (c) LSV chopped curves in light and dark conditions. (d) Photostability data for 1800 s. (e) EIS spectra of WS2, CdS and CdS@WS2 heterostructures. 
The photocurrent density of CdS@WS2 heterostructures is 0.15 mA cm−2vs. RHE in comparison to 0.003 mA cm−2 for WS2 and 0.02 mA cm−2 for CdS. A low photocurrent density for WS2 nanostructures indicates a poor electron hole pair separation. Due to the band offset of CdS@WS2 heterostructures, photogenerated holes and electrons are effectively separated on different surfaces. The separation in space restrains the recombination of electron–hole pairs in WS2 nanostructures and extends the life time of electrons with drastic improvement in photocurrent density. The photoanodes exhibited an onset potential of 0.6 V vs. RHE, which indicates efficient charge separation even at low overpotentials. Chronoamperometric data in Fig. 5(c) shows that the transient photocurrent density of CdS@WS2 heterostructures is nearly 20 times higher than that of CdS and WS2 electrodes. In addition, Fig. 5(d) at 1.23 V vs. RHE shows good stability for 1800 s for CdS@WS2 heterostructures with a decay for an initial period of 60 s under light illumination. The initial decay is due to the presence of surface traps in the material which leads to charge trapping.
CdS@WS2 heterostructure photoelectrochemical performance at different SILAR deposition cycles is presented in Fig. S3(a) of ESI† clearly indicating the highest Jph of 0.15 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE for 5 SILAR cycles of CdS deposition. SILAR cycles less than 5 lead to an incomplete coverage of CdS on the WS2 surface limiting the light absorption and thus, resulting in lower photocurrent density. Conversely, SILAR cycles greater than 5 lead to the formation of thick CdS deposition on the WS2 surface, which hinders fast charge transport and most likely, lead to charge recombination. In addition, increase in the number of SILAR deposition cycles also facilitates formation of large sized aggregates (Fig. S3(b) of ESI†) leading to slower interparticle diffusion and particle coalescence; hence, a performance deterioration is observed. Based on the discussion above, we deduce than an optimum CdS thickness is essential for efficient oxygen evolution which is at 5 cycles of SILAR deposition. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of pristine WS2, CdS and CdS@WS2 heterostructures are shown in Fig. 5(e) under one sun illumination at 0 V vs. RHE. The interfacial/charge transfer resistance is decreased for CdS@WS2 heterostructured electrode in comparison to pristine electrodes which further indicates their better photoexcitation and charge transfer properties. The results obtained in EIS are consistent with the increase in photocurrent densities. Solar to hydrogen conversion (STH) efficiency of PEC water splitting is presented and discussed in Fig. S4 of ESI.† The significantly improved performance of CdS@WS2 photoelectrodes is attributed to increased light harvesting ability and enhanced charge separation because of proper band alignment. In addition, the low onset potential further eliminates the need for voltage bias in practical applications.
3.4. Cr(VI) reduction mechanism and performance
All the absorbance spectra are presented in ESI.† Fig. S5† is the absorbance spectra for Cr(VI) reduction. A peak at 350 nm pertaining to dichromate anion is used for the calculations. CdS@WS2 heterostructures and pristine CdS show a red shift (368 nm) under light illumination which is attributed to the conversion of dichromate to chromate anions. Chromate and dichromate anions exist in chemical equilibrium (aqueous phase) in pertinence to the following reaction: Cr2O72− + H2O → 2CrO42− + 2H+(i)
The major factors influencing the equilibrium concentration above are the solution pH and Cr(VI) concentration. In acidic solutions, dichromate ion is predominant whereas, the chromate ion is predominant in near neutral conditions.43 In addition, a decrease in Cr(VI) concentration pushes the equilibrium in favor of chromate ions. Since our solution uses deionised water as a solvent without any further additions; pH is near neutral and chromate ions dominate over dichromate which explains the red shift in the absorbance spectra.
The reactions for Cr(VI) reduction are listed below: CdS@WS2+ hν → (CdS@WS2) e− + h+(ii) CrO42− + 4H2O + 3e− → Cr(OH)3 + 5OH−(iii) H2O + 2h+ → ½O2 + 2H+(iv)
The Cr(VI) reduction ratio is then estimated using equation:Reduction ratio = 1 − (Ct/C0) = (A0 − At)/A0thus Fraction of Cr(VI) left in solution = Ct/C0 = 1 − ((A0 − At)/A0)where C0 is the Cr(VI) concentration at time t = 0, Ct is the Cr(VI) concentration at time t = t, A0 is the absorbance at t = 0, and At is the absorbance at time t = t.
Blank tests are conducted in the absence of light as well as in the absence of catalyst. Fig. 6(a) shows that there is no Cr(VI) reduction in the absence of catalyst which eliminates photolysis reaction. It can be observed from Fig. 6(b) that Cr(VI) reduction is not appreciable in dark, which further indicates that the reactions are photocatalysed. Cr(VI) reduction ratio for pure WS2 after two hours of light irradiation is ∼5% as shown in Fig. 6(b) indicating poor photocatalytic activity of WS2, confirming the behavior observed for water splitting. CdS shows far superior photocatalytic activity reducing ∼89% of Cr(VI) in two hours while CdS@WS2 is observed to have reduced ∼68% of Cr(VI) in the same time. However, pristine CdS as a photocatalyst is prone to photocorrosion and dissolution due to OER which will result in water toxicity. CdS@WS2 heterostructures eliminate the above problem since OER takes place on WS2 surface and prevent CdS dissolution. Hence, these heterostructures are more practically applicable with low concerns of Cd induced toxicity.

A study of RhB oxidation over CdS@WS2 heterostructures is presented in Fig. 7(a). The adsorption of RhB over the catalyst surface reaches saturation in 20 minutes in dark and the total adsorption on the catalyst surface at the end of 60 minutes is ∼39%. When the sample is further exposed to light, RhB concentration falls to ∼45% in the first 40 minutes of light exposure with a final conversion of ∼58% at the end of two hours of light irradiation. There is a blue shift in the absorption peak of RhB from 554 nm to 500 nm as seen in Fig. S6,† which pertains to the degradation mechanism of RhB. RhB degradation can happen either by cleavage of conjugated chromophore or the N-ethyl group cleavage in the chromophore. The former mechanism does not show a shift in the absorption peak but the latter case involves the de-ethylation of all ethyl groups in N,N,N,N-tetraethylated rhodamine(RhB) to give rise to intermediates (N,N,N-triethylated rhodamine, N,N-diethylated rhodamine, N-ethylated rhodamine) and finally rhodamine with a corresponding shift in the absorption peak from 554 nm to 500 nm, which corroborates with our observations for RhB removal. CdS@WS2 heterostructures have been further studied for their application in a mixture of Cr(VI), Ni(II) and RhB with the absorbance spectra presented in Fig. S7 of ESI† and reduction/oxidation results shown in Fig. 7(b). In this setup, RhB undergoes oxidation wherein holes are involved; Ni(II) and Cr(VI) compete for the reduction wherein electrons are involved. Ni(II) forms [Ni(OH2)]2+ in water with a centrosymmetric octahedral structure which restricts the d–d transitions according to Laporte rule. Thus, the intensity of colour for [Ni(OH2)]2+ is weak requiring a higher concentration of Ni(II) for accurate measurements as is the present scenario during our measurements. Fig. 7(b) indicates interesting results. To begin with, RhB (mixture) shows similar surface adsorption to that of pure RhB in dark followed by similar RhB removal quantities in light conditions both as pure material and in the mixture. One thing of interest is that RhB forms RhB+ in water since it is a cationic dye. The adsorbed RhB+ on the catalyst surface can attract the negatively charged oxygen in chromate ions inducing more chromate ions on the catalyst surface.
 Fig. 7  CdS@WS2 heterostructures performance: (a) RhB removal in pure RhB. (b) Cr(VI), Ni(II) reduction and RhB oxidation in a mixture of Cr(VI), Ni(II) and RhB. 
In addition, RhB oxidation requires the generated holes and a fast RhB removal can generate more electrons for the Cr(VI) reduction. Both the synergistic effects above lead to an increased Cr(VI) from ∼68% (pure material) to ∼83% (mixture) for a total duration of 120 minutes and an increase in the Cr(VI) reduction in 40 minutes of light illumination from ∼29% (pure) to ∼51% (mixture) [Fig. 6(b) and 7(b)]. On the other hand, Ni(II) has a positive charge which is repelled by the catalyst to some extent leading to only 15% of Ni(II) adsorption on the catalyst surface followed by ∼39% of Ni(II) removal at the end of 120 minutes in light. A schematic of the proposed mechanism for both pure Cr(VI) reduction and a mixture of different materials is shown in Fig. 8. In the case of pure Cr(VI) in the solution, light irradiation excites the electrons in CdS causing them to jump to the conduction band. Since the Cr(VI) reduction potential lies in between the conduction band edges of CdS and WS2, excited electrons from CdS promote the Cr(VI) reduction. While the water oxidation potential lies above the valence band edge of WS2, holes from CdS are transferred to WS2 wherein, they take part in water oxidation. This helps in keeping the CdS surface devoid of OER and thus, prevent its photocorrosion and dissolution in water. It also reduces the charge recombination in both the materials leading to good reduction capability and stability. In addition, H+ and OH− ions formed during water oxidation and Cr(VI) reduction recombine to form H2O due to high pKa of water dissociation. In the case of a mixture of Cr(VI), Ni(II) and RhB, RhB oxidation happens instead of the water oxidation wherein the holes are consumed probably at a faster rate than water oxidation which leads to the availability of higher number of electrons on the other side leading to an increased Cr(VI) reduction along with Ni(II) reduction.

Conclusions
CdS@WS2 heterostructures have shown improved charge carrier dynamics indicating better light absorption with the generation of higher number of charge carriers and diminished charge carrier recombination which ultimately leads to improved photoelectrochemical properties. The water splitting (water oxidation) performance of WS2 nanostructures is improved 20-fold upon integrating it with CdS nanospheres exhibiting a notable photocurrent density of 0.15 mA cm−2 for oxygen evolution reaction. The as-synthesised photo electrode is highly crystalline; enables facile separation and transport of charges with good stability in a neutral electrolyte. The suitability of CdS@WS2 heterostructures is also demonstrated for photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction as it showed a reduction ratio of ∼68% in two hours in a pure system and ∼83% in a mixture of materials. It also shows good performance for RhB removal. Hence, CdS@WS2 heterostructures are applicable in PEC water splitting, Cr(VI) reduction and RhB removal. The present study paves way for further development of heterostructures of WS2 with other TMDs to formulate similar multifunctional materials.
