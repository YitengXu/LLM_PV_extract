In this paper, the intermediate band mechanism of Sn doped CuAlS2 was investigated both theoretically and experimentally, and the two sub-bandgaps were measured to be 1.91 eV and 1.31 eV, respectively. A novel and convenient method of Electrophoretic Deposition (EPD) was utilized to prepare Sn doped CuAlS2 films. Due to the wide-spectrum of absorption introduced by the intermediate band, Sn doped CuAlS2 films showed better photoelectrochemical performance (PEC).
Introduction
Traditional semiconductors can only absorb part of the whole solar spectrum with energy beyond the band gap width, but not the rest of the low-energy spectrum, thus limiting the efficiency of the solar cell.1 In 1997, Luque put forward a physical model of a intermediate band solar cell, in which an intermediate band (IB) was inserted into the band gap of the traditional semiconductor absorbing layer.2 Thus, the sub-bandgap energy photons can be absorbed through electron transition from the valence band (VB) to the intermediate band and from the intermediate band to the conduction band (CB), which together make a contribution to the photocurrent without out-put voltage degradation. In this model, the highest theoretical efficiency was proved to reach 63.2%, higher than the single-band gap cells (40.7%) and two-stack tandem cells (55.4%) under the same condition. Therefore, IBSCs are becoming a hotspot in the field of the third generation solar cells.3
So far, there are three methods to introduce an intermediate band into a semiconductor: quantum dots, high mismatched alloys, and bulk materials with deep-level impurities.4 For quantum dots IBSCs, the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) has been reported to reach 18%, however, because of the degradation of the out-put voltage, they are still worse than the reference cells without quantum dots; at the same time, the complicated producing process and inevitable high cost constrain the development of quantum dots IBSC in the future.5,6 For high mismatched alloys, O-doped ZnTe has been reported existing an intermediate band mechanism with a 50% enhanced PCE, but the efficiency is still low and the manufacturing technique is complex.7,8 For bulk materials with deep-level impurities, many DFT-based calculations have been carried out in different kinds of materials to prove the existence of IB, such as Ti and V doped In2S3 and MgIn2S4,9 Cr-doped Cu2ZnSnS4,10 Ti and Cr doped CuGaS2,11 etc.; and some materials have been prepared and demonstrated the IB mechanism experimentally, such as V doped In2S3,12 Fe-doped In2S3 and MgIn2S4,13 Ge, Sn and Cr doped CuGaS2,14,15 etc. Though the research in the doped IB materials is still in its infancy, the low cost makes it a promising method to assemble an excellent wide-spectrum absorber.
Many doped materials with a proved IB mechanism are not ideal candidates as absorbing layers for solar cells, for the non-radiative recombination caused by the interaction between the doping element and the host material.16 Therefore, the proper selection of host materials and doping elements are indispensable. Chalcopyrite materials are a good light absorbing layer, for example, CIGS cells are the highest efficiency film solar cells with excellent stability. At the same time, some kinds of sulfides with chalcopyrite structure have a proper band gap width to insert an IB, such as CuInS2 (1.5 eV)17, CuGaS2 (2.49 eV)18 and CuAlS2 (3.35 eV).19 Sn doping CuGaS2 and CuInS2 have been studied and proved IB mechanism theoretically and experimentally with enhanced photoelectric properties.20 However, wider band gap CuAlS2, which has been demonstrated to be an excellent p-type transparent conductor,21 has not been studied as IB materials.
In this work, Sn doped CuAlS2 powders were prepared and the IB characteristics of the materials were studied. The powder samples were synthesized by high temperature solid reaction in an evacuated quartz tube, while the films were formed by a novel and simple method of EPD. The IB characteristics was theoretically proved by Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP),22 and experimentally demonstrated by diffuse reflection spectra and photoluminescence spectra, and the photoelectrochemical performance were characterized by the electrochemical workstation.
Experimental section
Powder preparation
Raw powder of Cu2S was synthesized by stoichiometric elements of Cu (99.999%, SinoReag) and S (99.999%, SinoReag) in an evacuated quartz tube at 800 °C for 12 h. Then, CuAl1−xSnxS2 (x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08) powders were synthesized in the solid state reactions from as-prepared Cu2S, S (99.999%, SinoReag), Al (99.999%, SinoReag), Sn (99.999%, SinoReag) in an evacuated quartz tube. The sealed tubes were heated to 850 °C at 0.5 °C min−1, held for 12 h, then cooled naturally to room temperature. The obtained powders were ground, resealed in another quartz tube and heated to 850 °C for another 12 h to make the chemical constituents more homogeneous.
Film preparation
CuAl1−xSnxS2 (x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08) films were prepared by a novel and convenient method of EPD. The solution for EPD was composed of 25 ml ethanol and 25 ml acetone with 50 mg CuAl1−xSnxS2 powders and 25 mg I2 dispersed inside. Two pieces of FTO were respectively used as the cathode and anode. The suspended powders in the solution were deposited onto the cathode at 100 V cm−1 supplied by a DC power supply (INTERLOCK IPD-20001SLU, China) for 30 s. Then, the as-prepared films were heated to 400 °C for 2 h in an evacuated quartz tube with a little amount of sulfur powder inside.
Characterizations
CuAl1−xSnxS2 powder samples were transferred to a TEM grid (Quantifoil Cu 200 mesh) for these investigations. TEM and STEM elemental mapping were conducted using a JEOL 2100F microscope, operating at 200 kV. Patterns of XRD of the samples were obtained (Bruker D8 FOCUS, at 40 KV and 40 mA) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The optical absorption spectra of samples were obtained at room temperature by the UV-vis-NIR spectrometer (Hitachi U4100) equipped with an integrating sphere. The photoluminescence spectra of samples were obtained at room temperature, excited by 488 nm laser light and detected by NIR (Ge) detectors. XPS experiments were carried out on a RBD upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (Perkin Elmer) with Mg Kα radiation (hν = 1253.6 eV). Binding energies were calibrated by using the containment carbon (C 1s = 284.6 eV). The surface and cross-section morphology of CuAl1−xSnxS2 films was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800).
Calculation details
The first-principles computations based on DFT were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package. The generalized gradient approximations (GGA) was used to describe the exchange correlation functional, and projector augmented wave (PAW) method was used in this work. We constructed a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell which contained 64 atoms and then substituted one Al atom by Sn corresponding to the doping content of 6.25%. The cutoff energy of plane wave was chosen at 350 eV. The geometry optimization was performed by full relaxation of all internal atomic positions as well as unit cell volume and shape until the total energy changes within 10−4 eV per atom, and the Hellmann–Feynman force on all atoms was less than 0.01 eV Å−1.
PEC test
PEC measurements were performed in a typical three-electrode potentiostat system (Parstat 2773), in which the CuAl1−xSnxS2 film on carbon paper substrate, a Pt wire, and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. 0.25 M Na2S aqueous solution was used as the supporting electrolyte to maintain the stability of films. A xenon lamp with a power of 100 mW cm−2 was used as the illumination source. Photocurrent ON/OFF cycles were measured using the same electrochemical workstation coupled with a mechanical chopper.
Result and discussion
The powders of CuAl1−xSnxS2 synthesized by high-temperature solid reaction were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). For samples of small amount of doping Sn (x ≤ 0.04), all the diffraction peaks are indexed to the chalcopyrite phase, and no impurity peak is found (Fig. 1a). With the increase of doping amount, the XRD peaks shift to the left. This is caused by Sn4+ (71 Å) with a larger radius occupying Al3+ (50 Å) sites. However, when the doping amount reaches 0.08, impurity peaks appear, which is indexed to Cu5Sn2S7; compared with the sample of 0.04 doping amount, the diffraction peaks don't shift to the left any more. Therefore, the maximum doping amount is near x = 0.04. STEM elemental mapping analysis was used to examine the distribution of Sn element in a nanocrystal of CuAl0.96Sn0.04S2 sample. As is shown in Fig. 1b, the elemental mappings of Cu, Al, Sn and S have a homogeneous spatial distribution. The concentration of the four elements was investigated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The result shows that the ratio of Cu, Al, Sn and S is nearly the same with the nominal values of the powder constituents.

As is shown in Fig. 2a, with different Sn doping content, the color of CuAl1−xSnxS2 powder varies from offwhite (x = 0), light brown (x = 0.02), dark brown (x = 0.04), to light black (x = 0.08). The light absorptions of these powders were verified by UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflection spectra. By increasing doping content, the absorption is greatly broadened in the visible and near-infrared light range (500–1200 nm). Meanwhile, two shoulders are found at 650 nm and 950 nm, for which the corresponding energy is 1.91 eV and 1.31 eV, respectively (Fig. 2b). With the plots of (h)2 versus hν (based on the modified Kubelka–Munk function of F(R) = (1 − R)2/(2R) = α/S, where R is the reflectance, and S are the absorption and scattering coefficients), the intrinsic bandgap of CuAlS2 is measured to be 3.27 eV, which is almost equal to the sum of two shoulders' energy (1.91 and 1.31 eV). Therefore, the bandstructure of CuAl1−xSnxS2 is concluded in Fig. 3a. The total bandgap is about 3.27 eV, and two sub-bandgaps with energy of 1.91 eV and 1.31 eV are formed by an intermediate band introduced by Sn doping. Because of the existence of the two sub-bandgaps, low energy light that cannot be absorbed by intrinsic material is utilized effectively, so that the absorption spectra in the visible and near-infrared light range is dramatically widened.

In order to further monitor the energy states of Sn, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the CuAl1−xSnxS2 powders were performed, and the blue laser light (λ = 488 nm) was employed to excite the powders in the spectral range from 700 nm to 1200 nm. As is shown in Fig. 2c, an extra PL peak at 970 nm (1.28 eV) is revealed in the Sn-doped powders (e.g., x = 0.04). The recombination model of light-excited electron–hole pairs at 1.29 eV is proposed to occur from CB to IB, as is shown in the Fig. 3a, which is also consistent with the results of the absorption spectrum above. This is a very solid evidence to demonstrate the existence of an intermediate band in CuAl1−xSnxS2 (x ≠ 0).
The valence state of Sn was analyzed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 2d). Two nearly symmetrical peaks identified to be Sn 3d5/2 and 5d3/2, located at 486.6 and 495 eV respectively, with a peak separation of 8.4 eV, indicate Sn4+-S bonds. Therefore, it is inferred that the doped Sn atom with 4 valence electrons replacing the trivalent aluminium atom produces an extra electron, which contributes to forming the intermediate band between the VB and CB. In addition, this type of doping tends to make an n-type semiconductor, which will be confirmed in the later part.
In order to further understand the intermediate band theoretically, the electronic structures of CuAl1−xSnxS2 were calculated by first-principles theoretical calculations. For the pure CuAlS2, the bandgap between CB and VB is 1.7 eV (Fig. 3b) from the PAW calculation, which is lower than the experimental value 3.27 eV. This is a typical underestimation of gap in the DFT calculations due to the missing discontinuity in the exchange–correlation potential and the self-interaction error.13 Surprisingly, the Sn-doped CuAlS2 has a bandstructure almost the same with the undoped one, except that there is an intermediate band inserted into the forbidden zone (Fig. 3c). Meanwhile, the intermediate band in the calculated bandstructure is not a horizontal line, but a flexuous curve, which indicates the intermediate band are not localized. Therefore, the Shockley–Read–Hall recombination in Sn-doped CuAlS2 seems to be inhibited.23 The density of states (DOS) are calculated for further analyzing the intermediate band (Fig. 3d). The VB of CuAlS2 is mainly comprised of the Cu-3d states hybridized with S-3p, and the CB consists of Al-3s and S-3p states. The partially filled IB mainly contains Sn-5s and S-3p states, as desired for the IB scheme. Hence, the Sn-doped CuAlS2 has three direct bandgap transitions (VB → CB, VB → IB, IB → CB) enabling to absorb more photons.
Experimental and theoretical results manifest the existence of intermediate band of the Sn-doped CuAlS2 with much wider spectrum solar response. To further test the photoelectrochemical performance, films were fabricated.
The films of CuAl1−xSnxS2 were prepared by a novel and convenient method of electrophoresis. In this method, CuAl1−xSnxS2 powders were dispersed in mixed solution of ethanol and acetone with iodine inside. When a high electric field of 50–100 V cm−1 was applied in the solution, the dispersed sample powders swam and deposited onto the cathode material. Therefore, different conducting substrates can be used as cathode to prepare CuAl1−xSnxS2 films, such as FTO, metal plates or carbon paper. Films on different substrates are showed in Fig. 4b. The surface morphology of the prepared films on FTO substrates was analyzed by SEM. The size of the particles on the surface ranges from a few hundred nanometers to about 2 μm. Viewed from the cross section, the particle size decreases from the surface to the bottom which is caused by the mass differences among particles. Particles with a smaller mass move faster at the same voltage, and deposited more quickly on the substrate. By XRD analysis, the phase composition of the films are consistent with the powder samples, which confirms the film fabricating process is merely caused by electric field forces. Hence, the action mechanism is deduced as follows:

Firstly, the iodine in the solution reacted with acetone and formed hydrogen ions; secondly, the H+ interacted with sulfur atom of the CuAl1−xSnxS2 and absorbed on the surface of the powder samples thus introducing positive charge to the particles; thirdly, the charged particles were deposited onto the surface of the cathode and released the protons. The reaction equation were (CASS stands for CuAl1−xSnxS2): 
CH3COCH3 + I2 → CH3COCH2I + I− + H+
(1) 
H+ + CASS → (H–CASS)+
(2) 
(H–CASS)+ + substrate → CASS–substrate + H+
(3)
Furthermore, it can be inferred that this novel and simple method can also be expanded to the preparation of other sulfide films.
The photoelectrochemical performance were investigated in a typical three-electrode potentiostat system. The CuAl1−xSnxS2 thin films on carbon paper were prepared and then assembled into PEC cells. The electrochemical analysis was conducted in a three-electrode configuration using 0.25 M Na2S aqueous solution electrolyte. The Mott–Schottky (M–S) plot obtained at the frequency of 1000 Hz in dark has a positive slope to indicate the n-type conduction of CuAl1−xSnxS2 (Fig. 5b). As is well known, CuAlS2 is a good candidate of p-type transparent conductors when excess S is introduced.24 However, with stoichiometric or less content of S, CuAlS2 becomes highly resistive or n-type conductor with low charge carrier densities.19,25 With the addition of the doping amount, the slope decreases, indicating the increase of charge carrier densities, which is in accord with enhancement of the dark current in Fig. 5a. As is shown in Fig. 5a, by the measurement of transient photocurrent responses, the photocurrent density is significantly enhanced by increasing the Sn doping amount from 0 to 0.04, though the dark current just increases a little. Therefore, the remarkable improvement in PEC properties demonstrates that the extension of spectrum absorption caused by intermediate band effectively increases the photocurrent densities.

Conclusions
In summary, the mechanism of intermediate band was testified in Sn-doped CuAlS2. The Sn-doped CuAlS2 powders were synthesized by high temperature solid state reaction and EPD was found to be an effective and convenient way to fabricate Sn-doping CuAlS2 films. The IB characteristics was theoretically proved by VASP, and experimentally demonstrated by UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra and photoluminescence spectra, and the photoelectric performance were extraordinarily improved with the intermediate band introduced by doping Sn. Therefore, Sn-doped CuAlS2 is a potential promising candidate of light absorption layers of photovoltaic cells and can be applied in future full-spectrum solar cells.
