    , Accepted 14th August 2019First published on 16th August 2019AbstractBismuth-based organohalides have attracted much attention as potential alternatives to lead halide perovskites and have been explored in various electronic and optoelectronic devices. Developing new bismuth organohalides with rational design has been a dynamic research area. Herein, we developed single-crystals and thin-films of a new class of bismuth-based organohalides (phenethylammonium (C8H12N+, PEA+) bismuth halides). We found that comparable optical properties can be preserved after replacing methylammonium with bulky PEA+ cations. The bulky PEA+ cation significantly promotes the coverage and low surface roughness of bismuth organohalide thin-films in a facile one-step solution method. Newly-prepared (PEA)3Bi2I9 also shows excellent thermal and humidity stability, showing promise for addressing the toxicity and stability of optoelectronic/electronic devices beyond lead halide perovskites.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites have been emerging as one of the most promising classes of materials for next-generation photovoltaic technology, with efficiencies surging from 3.8% to over 24% in a remarkably short period.1–7 Along with their success in photovoltaics, these lead-based organohalides have also found broad applications in various optoelectronic/electronic devices, including photodetectors,8 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),9,10 lasers,11 memory devices,12,13 sensors14 and radiation detectors.15–17 However, serious concerns on their stability and lead toxicity are still among the key challenges in these areas.18–24 Therefore, developing environmentally benign and lead-free organohalide materials as alternatives to the lead analogs is critically important in a broad range of applications.25–32 In previous reports, several lead-free metal halide perovskites/perovskite variants have been studied, including tin (Sn),22,33 germanium (Ge),34,35 copper (Cu),36,37 antimony (Sb),38 and bismuth (Bi)39–43 based alternatives. Tin and germanium halide perovskites show poor stability in an ambient atmosphere.22,34 Copper-based halide perovskites have been reported with power conversion efficiencies of 0.5–0.6%.36,37 Although these copper compounds have relatively good stability in air, thermal stability is one of their limitations.37 Sb3+ and Bi3+ show the same electronic configuration as that of Pb2+.44 Antimony-based organohalides (typically (CH3NH3)3Sb2I9) were reported with efficiencies of 0.5% and ∼2.04% in solar cells by different research groups.38 While antimony is still toxic, its non-toxic analogue, bismuth has attracted much more attention.42,43,45–47 In general, methylammonium bismuth iodide (MA3Bi2I9 with MA = CH3NH3+) consists of a dimeric anionic structure with two face-sharing octahedra (Bi2X93−, X = Cl, Br, or I).40,48–50 The crystal structure is different from those of three-dimensional perovskites that normally adopt corner-sharing octahedra.23,29 MA3Bi2I9 is one of the typical Bi-based organohalide materials that has been intensively studied in the past few years. By replacing the methylammonium cation, Cs3Bi2I9, (C6H5NH3)BiI4, and (H3NC6H12NH3)BiI5 have been synthesized and applied in solar cells.39,42,43 Despite the low photovoltaic efficiencies, these materials show much higher air and humidity stability over their lead analogs. No decomposition was observed on a (C6H5NH3)BiI4 thin-film in ambient air with a relative humidity of 50–70%.43 In addition to material stability, bismuth based organohalides show tunable electronic and optical properties,39,44,51 ferroelectricity,52 phase transition,49 photochromic effect,53 luminescence44 and nonlinear optical activity,54 which enable potentially broad applications not only in solar cells, but also in various other electronic and optoelectronic devices.47,51,55 For electronic and optoelectronic applications, facile and fully-covered thin-film deposition is crucial. Taking Cs3Bi2I9 and MA3Bi2I9 as examples, one-step spin-coating generally gives isolated hexagonal crystals on the substrate.39,40,51 To achieve dense and uniform thin-films, various sophisticated/time-consuming approaches have been developed, including anti-solvent-assisted spin-coating, vapour-assisted conversion, thermal evaporation and gas-pumping treatment.43,56–59
However, a simple and low-cost approach for uniform thin-film deposition of bismuth-based metal halide materials is of key importance for their thin-film based device applications.
Herein, we report a new class of bismuth-based organohalides, phenethylammonium (C8H12N+, PEA) bismuth organohalides. Three new compounds were developed and systematically investigated as single-crystals and thin-films, namely (PEA)3Bi2I9, (PEA)3Bi2Br9 and (PEA)4Bi2Cl10. We found that different halides affect the connectivity of anionic clusters of the bismuth organohalides. Compared to the traditionally studied MA3Bi2I9 as the organic cation, the phenethylammonium cation promotes the formation of fully-covered bismuth halide thin-films in a facile one-step deposition technique, which is largely due to a synergistic effect of enhanced wettability of the precursor solution on the substrate and thermal stability of (PEA)3Bi2I9 itself. This offers an alternative strategy to address the thin-film deposition challenge of organic–inorganic bismuth halides by using bulky organic cations without sacrificing the merits of their optical and electronic properties. The as-prepared (PEA)3Bi2I9 thin-films exhibit excellent thermal and humidity stability in an ambient atmosphere and better performance than that of MA3Bi2I9 in solar cells.
Results and discussion
Since phenethylammonium bismuth chloride, bromide and iodide have not been reported previously, single crystals of these materials were firstly synthesized and characterized. A similar strategy based on a previous report was adopted herein to prepare these single crystals.40 Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) results of these three compounds are presented in Table 1, which reveals chemical formulas of (PEA)3Bi2I9, (PEA)3Bi2Br9 and (PEA)4Bi2Cl10, respectively. (PEA)3Bi2I9 and (PEA)3Bi2Br9 are isostructural while (PEA)4Bi2Cl10 differs in both its stoichiometry and structure. Comprehensive crystallographic information of these structures can be found in Tables S1–S3 in the ESI.† Similar to MA3Bi2I9, the structures of (PEA)3Bi2I9, (PEA)3Bi2Br9 and (PEA)4Bi2Cl10 comprise bismuth halide octahedral anionic clusters with the PEA+ cations situated in between. The Bi2I93− and Bi2Br93− anions consist of two discrete face-sharing octahedrons, unlike the traditional corner-sharing octahedron in lead organohalide perovskites. For every face-sharing octahedron, Bi is located at the centre of each octahedron, while the halide anions are on the corners, and each complex is surrounded by the PEA cations. These isolated Bi2I93− and Bi2Br93− bi-octahedral clusters indicate a discrete zero-dimensional (0D) structure, compared to that of the three-dimensional structures in lead halide perovskites (Fig. 1). The bridging Bi–X bond lengths are longer than the terminal bonds in accord with structures of other Bi2X93− salts in the literature.60–62 Interestingly, the (PEA)4Bi2Cl10 structure is different from those of (PEA)3Bi2I9 and (PEA)3Bi2Br9, and comprises edge-sharing Bi2Cl104− octahedra with disordered PEA cations. As expected from the structures of other Bi2Cl104− salts in the literature,53,61 there is considerable variation in the Bi–Cl bonds within the Bi2Cl104− anion. The bridging Bi–Cl bonds are significantly longer than the terminal bonds and the terminal axial Bi–Cl bonds are longer than the equatorial Bi–Cl bonds that are trans to the bridging chloride ligands. Therefore, different halides can affect the connectivity of anionic clusters of the bismuth organohalides. Calculated powder XRD spectra of (PEA)3Bi2I9, (PEA)3Bi2Br9 and (PEA)4Bi2Cl10 are presented in Fig. 2a for (PEA)3Bi2I9 and Fig. S1† for (PEA)3Bi2Br9 and (PEA)4Bi2Cl10. Experimental XRD spectra of the as-prepared (PEA)3Bi2I9, (PEA)3Bi2Br9 and (PEA)4Bi2Cl10 thin-films were compared with the calculated results. The XRD pattern indicates a good consistency with the calculated XRD with a high orientation in crystal growth in the films. The colour and appearance of the (PEA)3Bi2I9 solution and the final film can be seen in Fig. S2.† Optical properties of these prepared materials were studied using ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy in Fig. 2b.

Assuming both direct and indirect characteristics for the semiconductor type, their bandgaps were calculated and are summarized in Table 2. Absorption and indirect bandgap spectra of the materials can be seen in Fig. 2b and c respectively. Comparing the light-absorption of (PEA)3Bi2I9 and MAPbI3, (PEA)3Bi2I9 has weaker light-absorption capability. This can be due to the lower absorption coefficient of (PEA)3Bi2I9, which is estimated to be around 0.5 × 105 cm−1 at 450 nm, whereas for MAPbI3 it is around 2 × 105 cm−1.23 However, (PEA)3Bi2I9 has a higher absorption coefficient than MA3Bi2I9 (104 cm−1) at the same wavelength of 450 nm.63 Based on their optical bandgaps, (PEA)3Bi2I9 and MA3Bi2I9 are similar. Therefore, its energy band levels were determined by ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) for further application in potential optoelectronics (Fig. 2d).

The electronic band structure of (PEA)3Bi2I9 was theoretically studied to evaluate the experimental results using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. 3a). The calculated direct bandgaps for the different points of the Brillouin zone of (PEA)3Bi2I9 are summarized in Table 3. The minimum direct bandgap was observed at the Γ point with a value of 2.05 eV. In addition, the minimum indirect bandgap is around 2.03 eV for (PEA)3Bi2I9, as the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM) are located at Γ and Q points of the Brillouin zone, respectively (Fig. 3a). Therefore, the selected material is an indirect bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of 2.03 eV, which is comparable with the experimental results (Table 2). Partial density of states (DOS) calculation suggests that the electronic states of (PEA)3Bi2I9 at the CBM are mainly contributed by the 6p orbital of the bismuth (Bi) atom and 5p orbital of the iodine (I) atom, while the electronic states at the VBM are predominantly contributed by the 5p orbital of iodine (I) atoms and 2p orbital of carbon (C) atoms (Fig. 3b). DFT and DOS calculations and measurement of electronic properties of (PEA)3Bi2Br9 and (PEA)4Bi2Cl10 were also performed and the results can be found in Fig. S3 and Table S4.† Given the measured bandgaps and the absorption onsets, (PEA)3Bi2I9 was further characterized owing to its comparable bandgap to MA3Bi2I9. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) was performed to experimentally estimate the VBM and CBM positions relative to the vacuum level (Fig. 2d). By extrapolating the secondary electron cut-off (SECO) region, −6.14 eV was estimated for the VBM of (PEA)3Bi2I9 with respect to the vacuum level. Similarly, an energy level of −3.91 eV was determined for its CBM based on its optical bandgap of 2.23 eV. In comparison to MA3Bi2I9 (VBM = −5.90 and CBM = −3.78 eV)40 and MAPbI3 (VBM = −5.4 and CBM = −3.9 eV),64 the energy levels of (PEA)3Bi2I9 show its possibility for further optoelectronic applications. In order to experimentally determine the work function of (PEA)3Bi2I9, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was employed. According to the surface potential image of the (PEA)3Bi2I9 film (Fig. 4a and b), its work function was calculated to be −4.93 eV based on eqn (1), where ϕtip is the work function of the Pt-coated conductive cantilever probe and the CPD is the average contact potential difference. ϕsample = ϕtip − CPD(1)

A band alignment diagram of (PEA)3Bi2I9 is shown in Fig. 4c compared with other traditional components of a hybrid perovskite solar cell. (PEA)3Bi2I9 is compatible with most of the electron/hole transporting layers according to the diagram and thus can be used as the active layer in solar cells. In the current work, P3HT and TiO2 were selected for further study.
Thin-film deposition of bismuth organohalides is critically important for their optoelectronic application. In general, one-step spin-coating of bismuth organohalides leads to non-uniform and poor film-coverage on the substrates of transparent conductive oxides.39,40,46,65 This impedes the application of these hybrid bismuth halides in various thin-film based electronic and optoelectronic devices. Importantly, it was found that the film coverage can be significantly improved by the substitution of MA+ with the PEA+ cation, which provides a facile and effective strategy for addressing this thin-film deposition issue. In previous reports, multiple processes or sophisticated setups were required for depositing uniform and high-coverage thin-films of MA3Bi2I9.56,58 It is worthwhile to understand the influence of the PEA+ effect on the film morphologies, and thus (MA1−xPEAx)3Bi2I9 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1) films were prepared via a spin-coating method on FTO substrates. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of these films are compared in Fig. 5a–j. The one-step spin-coated MA3Bi2I9 thin-film tends to form large isolated hexagonal crystals in a range of several micrometers with large substrate exposure areas on the FTO, which is not desirable for its applications. As the PEA amount gradually increases in the organic cations of the hybrid bismuth halides, the as-prepared thin-film shows reduced crystal size with concurrently minimized gaps among the adjacent crystals. By completely replacing MA with PEA at x = 1, the film represents nano-sized grains with nearly full coverage on the substrate surface, confirming the promoted film-quality by simply adding an organic cation group with a more bulky alkyl group in bismuth organohalides.66–71
 Fig. 5  Low and high magnification SEM images of (MA1−xPEAx)3Bi2I9 films with (a and f) x = 0, (b and g) x = 0.25, (c and h) x = 0.5, (d and i) x = 0.75, and (e and j) x = 1 on FTO. 
Although there are still some cracks existing in the (PEA)3Bi2I9 thin-film, these (PEA)3Bi2I9 thin-films have shown a significant improvement in film-coverage compared with MA3Bi2I9, and a superior device performance in the (PEA)3Bi2I9-based device also indirectly supports this improvement in the following discussion. In addition to the film coverage, the (PEA)3Bi2I9 thin-film also shows a significantly reduced surface roughness compared with that of MA-incorporated counterparts (Fig. 6a–f). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) results show that the pristine film without PEA (x = 0) shows a root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of around 44 nm, whereas the film with PEA (x = 1) has a significantly reduced RMS of ∼8 nm. XRD spectra of the (MA1−xPEAx)3Bi2I9 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1) thin-films (Fig. 6g) show obviously suppressed signals from the FTO substrates in the (PEA)3Bi2I9 film, which is another indicator of remarkably improved film uniformity and coverage promoted by the PEA+ cations. In addition, a preferred crystal orientation along (1 0 −1) was observed in the (PEA)3Bi2I9 film. To further study the effect of bulky organic cations in bismuth organohalides, formamidinium (CH5N2, FA) and n-butylammonium (C4H12N, BA) based hybrid bismuth halide thin-films were prepared. As the FA cation is comparable to that of MA, a similar film morphology was observed, while the BA-based thin-film shows much higher film-coverage due to its longer alkyl chain than that of MA and FA (Fig. S4†).

The wettability of the precursor solutions of MA3Bi2I9 and (PEA)3Bi2I9 on the substrate was studied by comparing their contact angles. (PEA)3Bi2I9 showed a contact angle of around 19° while it was more than 32° for that of MA3Bi2I9 (Fig. 6h and i), suggesting a better wettability upon the substrate for the (PEA)3Bi2I9 precursor. In addition, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) testing reveals considerable thermal stability up to 300 °C for the as-deposited (PEA)3Bi2I9 thin-films, while MA3Bi2I9 has a gradual reduction in component weight even below 300 °C, indicating much better thermal stability in (PEA)3Bi2I9 (Fig. 6j). This can also be a possible explanation for the non-uniform film morphology of MA3Bi2I9, which might be partially caused by losing some components at the 120 °C annealing step, leading to isolated crystals with exposed substrate areas. Therefore, the synergistic effect of the markedly enhanced wettability and thermal stability by using PEA cations should contribute to the significantly improved film coverage and low surface roughness in the (PEA)3Bi2I9 thin-film. In general, the film morphology is important to retard the recombination of photo-generated charges in the optoelectronic device. In fact, one of the issues of the MA3Bi2I9 film is its high surface roughness and a large number of pinholes. The high surface roughness causes additional challenges to deposit the hole-transporting layer on its top, while the pinholes in the thin-film potentially increase the charge recombination in the optoelectronic devices. The low surface roughness factor and high film coverage make (PEA)3Bi2I9 a potentially superior candidate for device applications to MA3Bi2I9. A preliminary study was performed in solar cells in this work.
Firstly, (PEA)3Bi2I9 was employed as the active layer in solar cells with a planar structure of FTO/compact TiO2 (C-TiO2)/bismuth organohalides/P3HT/Au. In this structure, MA3Bi2I9 shows a best PCE of 0.043%, while (PEA)3Bi2I9 can achieve a best PCE of 0.086% (Table S5† and Fig. S5a†). Statistic photovoltaic results are summarized from 13 devices based on MA3Bi2I9 and (PEA)3Bi2I9 as the active layer, respectively (Fig. S5b–e†). It can be found that the highest Jsc of (PEA)3Bi2I9-based devices is almost twice that of MA3Bi2I9, which is largely due to better film-coverage in the (PEA)3Bi2I9 films. In addition, a mesoporous device structure that consists of FTO/C-TiO2/mesoporous TiO2 (M-TiO2)/bismuth organohalides/P3HT/Au was fabricated by using MA3Bi2I9 and (PEA)3Bi2I9 as the active layer. A cross-sectional SEM image is shown in Fig. 7a for a (PEA)3Bi2I9 based device, suggesting uniform distribution of (PEA)3Bi2I9 in ∼1 μm-thick M-TiO2. The best photovoltaic performance for the (PEA)3Bi2I9 based mesoporous devices included a Jsc of 0.813 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.614 V and FF of 0.46, leading to a PCE of 0.230%. In contrast, the MA3Bi2I9 devices show a Jsc of 0.406 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.515 V, FF of 0.44 and PCE of 0.092% (Fig. 7b). The statistical distribution of photovoltaic results for 24 (PEA)3Bi2I9 and MA3Bi2I9 devices is summarized in Fig. S6,† further confirming superior performance of the (PEA)3Bi2I9 based devices. In fact, the low coverage of MA3Bi2I9 films is the main cause of shunting pathways in the structure with a direct connection between the ETL and HTL, leading to inferior photovoltaic performance. However, it is noteworthy to mention that the optical bandgap of (PEA)3Bi2I9 is comparable to that of MA3Bi2I9, which also contributes to the higher photocurrent in (PEA)3Bi2I9. However, the bandgaps of lead based organohalides shift to much larger values by replacing the MA cation with more bulky organic cations and the crystal packing changes from 3-dimensional to 2-dimensional structures.72 The current density of the (PEA)3Bi2I9 solar cell was determined to be 0.79 mA cm−2 by calculating the integrated current from IPCE measurement (Fig. S7†). Since the P3HT layer can partially contribute to light absorption,40 this influence was examined by fabricating devices with the structure FTO/C-TiO2/M-TiO2/P3HT/Au, which showed a Jsc of 0.268 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.355 V, FF of 0.42 and efficiency of 0.04. This confirms a 33% contribution of P3HT in light absorption and the final photocurrent density (Jsc) of the best performing (PEA)3Bi2I9-based solar cells (Fig. S8†). Current–voltage hysteresis in lead-based perovskite solar cells causes an inaccuracy in the resultant efficiency.73–75 To check hysteresis in the (PEA)3Bi2I9 based devices, J–V curves of the devices were measured in both forward and reverse scans (Fig. S9†). Interestingly, this material shows almost no hysteresis behaviour, which is an advantage for further study in photovoltaic applications.

(b) J–V curve of the best performing devices with MA3Bi2I9 and (PEA)3Bi2I9 as the active layer. (c) XRD patterns of the (PEA)3Bi2I9 film on the FTO substrate under different exposure times to the ambient air. 
Long-term stability testing of the photovoltaic devices was performed in air (Fig. S10†) and a summary of J–V parameters is shown in Table S6.† The device performance of the 20th-day test is well above the results from the initial testing. The origin of this stable performance may be attributed to the excellent humidity stability of the (PEA)3Bi2I9 film in ambient air, which is evident from the XRD results of the (PEA)3Bi2I9 film stored at an average humidity of 64 ± 10% for long-term stability tests (Fig. 7c). After 60 days, the (PEA)3Bi2I9 film shows no obvious degradation, as the (1 0 −1) diffraction peak in the XRD spectra retains its intensity. Therefore, the (PEA)3Bi2I9 material shows excellent humidity stability in addition to its other merits including good thermal stability, non-toxicity, solution-processability, ease of fabrication and optical properties. (PEA)3Bi2I9 is a promising alternative as a lead-free organohalide semiconductor for future optoelectronic and electronic applications.
Conclusions
In summary, a new class of bismuth organohalides based on the phenethylammonium cation (C8H12N+, PEA+) has been reported for the first time. Single crystals of (PEA)3Bi2I9, (PEA)3Bi2Br9 and (PEA)4Bi2Cl10 have been synthesized and investigated by both experimental and theoretical approaches. It was found that different halides can affect the connectivity of the inorganic octahedral clusters, leading to varied crystal stoichiometry. The optical bandgaps of these three new bismuth organohalides are 2.23, 2.66, and 3.28 eV for (PEA)3Bi2I9, (PEA)3Bi2Br9 and (PEA)4Bi2Cl10, respectively. Unlike lead halide perovskites, incorporation of the bulky organic cation (i.e. PEA+) into the bismuth organic halides has limited influence on the optical bandgaps, which is evident from a comparable bandgap between MA3Bi2I9 and (PEA)3Bi2I9. Compared with traditionally studied MA3Bi2I9, however, (PEA)3Bi2I9 shows excellent thermal and humidity stability, as well as superior performance in solar cells. More importantly, the (PEA)+ organic cation significantly promotes the coverage and low surface roughness of the (PEA)3Bi2I9 thin-film in a facile one-step spin-coating method, which can be attributed to a synergistic effect of enhanced wettability and thermal stability by using PEA cations. This provides an effective approach for addressing the thin-film deposition issue of bismuth organohalides by developing bulky organic cation based counterparts. These new hybrid semiconductors based on stable and low-toxic bismuth organohalides are promising for a variety of next-generation solution-processable optoelectronic and electronic devices.
Experimental details
All steps of materials deposition and device fabrication were performed in a glovebox except placing solutions into a fume hood for single crystal growth.
Preparation of single crystal (PEA)-Bi-halides (I, Br, and Cl)
Three phenethylammonium (C8H12N+, PEA) bismuth organohalides were synthesized, namely PEA bismuth chloride ((PEA)4Bi2Cl10), bromide ((PEA)3Bi2Br9) and iodide ((PEA)3Bi2I9), respectively. Single crystals of (PEA)3Bi2I9, (PEA)3Bi2Br9 and (PEA)4Bi2Cl10 were grown by dissolving 1.5 mmol of (PEA)-halide with 1 mmol of Bi-halide in 2 mL anhydrous methanol (Sigma Aldrich). After one-hour of ultra-sonication, the solution was filtered using PTFE syringe filters (pore size: 0.45 μm). The transparent solution was transferred to another clean glass vial while the lid was covered with parafilm. By making some fine holes on the parafilm, the solvent evaporated gradually to form single crystals on the inner wall of the glass vial.
(PEA)3Bi2I9 and MA3Bi2I9 thin-film deposition
For thin-film deposition, firstly 0.25 mmol of BiI3 (bismuth(III) iodide 99.999%, Alfa Aesar) and 0.375 mmol of (PEA)I (phenethylammonium iodide, (C8H12N)3I, Dyesol) or MAI (methylammonium iodide, CH3NH3I Dyesol) were dissolved in 0.5 mL DMF (dimethylformamide, Sigma Aldrich) followed by 1 hour ultra-sonication. The solution was filtered with PTFE syringe filters (0.45 μm). Then this transparent solution was used to deposit a film on different substrates, including fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) or TiO2 mesoporous layer covered FTO. 60 μL of the (PEA)3Bi2I9 solution was dispersed on the pre-heated substrate at 100 °C for 2 minutes, and then the solution was spin-coated on the substrate at 2000 rpm (revolutions per minute) for 30 s with a ramping rate of 600 rpm s−1. The coated samples were annealed at 120 °C for 10 minutes.
Device fabrication
FTO glass slides (FTO22-7, Yingkou OPV Tech New Energy Co. Ltd) were cleaned sequentially by ultra-sonication in acetone, ethanol, and isopropanol for 10 minutes. Then the surface was further cleaned with UV-Ozone for 15 minutes. Afterwards, a 0.42 M precursor solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75% wt in isopropanol) in anhydrous 2-propanol was used to deposit a thin compact-TiO2 (C-TiO2) layer by spray pyrolysis. For devices with a mesoporous-structure, a TiO2 paste (30 NR-D titania paste, 30 nm, Dyesol) was firstly diluted with absolute ethanol in a weight ratio of 1:1.5 and then was deposited onto the substrate by a doctor blade method. Specifically, C-TiO2 layer covered FTO was treated with UV-Ozone for 15 minutes, and then the edges of the substrate were covered with 3M scotch tape as the unwanted area. Finally, the diluted TiO2 paste was spread onto the C-TiO2 using a clean glass rod. The coated substrates were annealed at 500 °C for 30 minutes. A thick mesoporous TiO2 layer (M-TiO2) with a thickness of approximately 1 μm was achieved. Light-absorbing layers of (PEA)3Bi2I9 or MA3Bi2I9 were deposited according to the aforementioned steps. For planar-structured devices, the (PEA)3Bi2I9 layer was directly deposited onto the C-TiO2 layer. The hole transport layer (HTL) was prepared by spin-coating pristine poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) (Sigma-Aldrich, Mw 54000–75000, 15 mg mL−1 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene) solution at 2000 rpm for 30 s at 1000 rpm s−1. Annealing of the P3HT layer at 100 °C for 15 minutes was helpful to dry the layer and remove the additional solvent. Finally, ∼40 nm Au was thermally deposited as the contact electrode using a thermal evaporator (DD ONG high technology). The measured aperture area was 0.16 cm2.
Characterization
A solar simulator (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2, Oriel) equipped with a Keithley 2420 digital source meter was used to record current–voltage (J–V) plots. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data of the (PEA)3Bi2I9, (PEA)3Bi2Br9 and (PEA)4Bi2Cl10 single crystals were recorded using an Oxford Diffraction Gemini Ultra S CCD diffractometer with either Mo-Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) or Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å). The crystal was cooled to 190 K with an Oxford Cryosystems Desktop Cooler. The structures were solved and refined by full matrix least-squares analysis with SHELXL76 within the WinGX77 package. CCDC deposition No. 1939237, 1938992 and 1938991 includes the supplementary crystallographic data for (PEA)3Bi2I9, (PEA)3Bi2Br9 and (PEA)4Bi2Cl10, respectively.
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed on a Bruker Advanced X-ray Diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation from 5° to 70° (2θ). A Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL 7100) was used to record scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the sample morphologies. Absorption spectra of the films were recorded on a UV-visible light spectrometer (Shimadzu UV2450). Calculated spectra were achieved according to the Kubelka–Munk equation. For the stability test, (PEA)3Bi2I9 and MA3Bi2I9 thin-films deposited on the bare FTO substrates were placed in ambient air with an average humidity of 64 ± 10%. XRD spectra of the films were recorded on the first, 25th and 50th day to check the degradation behaviour. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured via a Newport 1918-c power meter equipped with a 300 W Oriel xenon light source and an Oriel Cornerstone 2601/4 m monochromator in a DC mode. A standard Si reference was used before the IPCE measurement. This step was done with an OCA20 sessile/pendant drop measurement instrument.
Numerical simulations
The first-principles density functional theory (DFT)78,79 calculations were performed in the framework of the CASTEP80 (Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package) module of Materials Studio 2016. The generalized gradient approximation of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE)81 was used to evaluate the electronic exchange and correlation energy. The Vanderbilt-type ultrasoft pseudopotential82 was used to analyze the electrostatic interaction between the valence electrons and ionic core. The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS)83 minimization technique was used for the optimization of the crystal geometry and energy. The electronic structure was optimized by using a density mixing scheme.84 A cutoff energy of 500 eV was used for the expansion of the plane waves. The Monkhorst–Pack scheme85k-point of 16 × 7 × 10 was used for the sampling of the Brillouin zone.
