    , Accepted 9th January 2012First published on 10th February 2012AbstractHeterostructure ZnO/TiO2 core–brush nanostructures were synthesized on glass substrates by a combination of aqueous solution growth and magnetron sputtering method. The microstructure and morphology were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The heterostructure core–brush shows the single crystal ZnO nanorod as the core and polycrystalline TiO2 nanowires as the brush-like outer layer. Surface electronic states and optical transmittance were measured using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and a UV-vis spectrometer. The growth mechanism was proposed as a slow “particle-by-particle” mechanism. The photocatalytic activity of the ZnO/TiO2 core–brush nanostructure was evaluated by the decomposition reaction of Bromo-Pyrogallol Red dye under UV (245 nm) and visible-light (450 nm) irradiation. The results revealed that the core–brush structure exhibited much higher photocatalytic activities than that of a TiO2 film and a TiO2/ZnO composite film. The photocatalytic activity enhancement of the ZnO/TiO2 core–brush could be attributed to the interaction effect, lower band gap energy and its unique core–brush feature which can lower the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs, extend the absorption range and provide a high density of active sites.
1. Introduction
Wide band gap transition metal oxide semiconductor materials such as zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) have attracted considerable research interest in the past few decades because of their unique properties.1,2 Fabrication and application of their nanostructures have been widely studied. In particular, efforts have been made to use these nanostructured semiconductors as dye sensitive solar cell (DSSC) components or photocatalysts.3,4TiO2 has proven to be one of the best photocatalysts for decomposing organic compounds, with uses in self-cleaning glass and photo-induced water splitting.5ZnO nanomaterials have also been demonstrated to be efficient photocatalysts for the decomposition of organic components under UV irradiation.6 However, due to their large band gaps (TiO2 ∼3.2 eV, ZnO ∼3.4 eV),1,5 both TiO2 and ZnO normally only work under UV irradiation and have a relatively low efficiency thus restricting their practical applications. Current research efforts are focused on the extension of the spectral response of the materials to the visible-light region and increasing the charge separation, including tailoring morphology and structures, turning band gaps via metal ions and anionic doping, and surface modification.7,8 Among these methods, doping of various elements has been the most popular technique to extend the catalyst's optical absorption range.9 However, the limitation of doping mainly arises because doping generates structural imperfections and vacancies, which act as the recombination centres and reduce the lifetime of the electron–hole pairs.10 As an alternative, properly building the heterogeneous nanostructure has been proposed to be an efficient way to improve the light absorption features and lengthen the carry lift time characteristics of the photocatalysts.11
Heterogeneous bi-layer nanostructures, particularly core–shell structures have specific crystal structures, surface area and band gap energy. Smith et al. reported that TiO2/WO3 core–shell nanorod arrays showed superior photocatalytic activity compared with a TiO2 thin film and TiO2/WO3 composite films.11 This enhancement was mainly due to the surface area increase in the TiO2 layer. In addition, the small WO3 band gap (2.8 eV) allows light with λ ≤ 443 nm to be absorbed by the core–shell structure, and the photocatalytic activity can be extended to a larger spectral range. ZnO/(La, Sr) CoO3 (ZnO/LSCO) core–shell composite nanorod arrays exhibited better photocatalytic properties than ZnO nanorod arrays and LSCO thin films.12 Most TiO2 or ZnO based heterostructures were combined with metal oxides with smaller band gaps, for example, WO3 (2.8 eV), Cu2O (2.2 eV)13 and Fe2O3 (2.2 eV).14 Additional small band-gap material allows visible light (λ ≥ 400 nm) to be absorbed by the heterostructures. Some heterogeneous structures can suppress interfacial charge recombination and further improve the overall photocatalytic performance.15ZnO has a similar band edge energy (∼3.2 eV) as TiO2, but exhibits higher electron mobility and longer life time of carriers than TiO2.2 Some ZnO nanostructures showed better photocatalytic activity than TiO2 nanoparticles (P25).16 The shortage of ZnO photocatalyst is due to the fact that ZnO is a chemically unstable material. It can be dissolved in both acid and basic solutions, and optical corrosion is also a problem.17 We attempt to design and fabricate a ZnO/TiO2 heterogeneous bi-layer structure which combines the merits of these two materials and improves photocatalytic performance, with characteristics such as high efficiency and durability.
Proper controlled growth of the core–shell structure with ideal crystalline and crystal size is key to modifying the photochemical property. ZnO was chosen to be the core material mainly because aqueous solution growth (AGS) of nanostructured ZnO can be easily controlled through appropriate adjustment of the reaction conditions, such as the pH, concentration, solvent, additive and temperature.4ZnO nanorod or nanowire arrays have been used as templates or support structures for the preparation of composite semiconductor nanostructures, for example, ZnO/Al2O3 and ZnO/ZnTe core–shell structures. These heterostructures showed an enhanced performance in the photoenergy-to-electron conversion rection.18TiO2 was chosen to be the outside layer material due to its good photocatalytic property and excellent stability against both chemical and photo-corrosion.
The most popular way to fabricate core–shell nanostructures is by wet-chemical methods. For example, two-stage hydrothermal growth, co-condensation and in situoxidation have been reported to form ZnO/MgO, ZnO/SiO2 and Ag/AgCl core–shell nanorod arrays.19 Chemical methods are relative simple for synthesising core–shell nanostructures. However, it remains a great challenge to accurately control the thickness of the shell and the size of the particles, whilst simultaneously achieving a crystalline nanostructure. These parameters will significantly influence the photocatalytic performance of the composite nanomaterial. As a result, physical techniques are promising alternative approaches to deposit core–shell structures due to the advantages of fine controllable deposition of thin layer and nanoparticles.
Amongst various physical deposition routes, magnetron sputtering is considered to be a simple, stable and easily controlled deposition method. Magnetron sputtering is a physical vapour deposition technique. Due to the special ‘atom-scale layer-by-layer’ deposition mode, the thickness of the layer can be easily modified. It is commonly used to deposit amorphous TiO2 thin films.20 To prepare crystalline TiO2 films, reactive sputtering at high temperature or post-deposition treatment is often needed.21 There have been few reports on the deposition of a TiO2 crystalline nanostructure at ambient temperature using a magnetron sputter.
We developed a two-step approach to synthesize ZnO/TiO2 uniform heterogeneous nanorod arrays on glass substrates. The two-step approach combines the technical advantages of both the aqueous solution growth (AGS) method and the magnetron sputtering process. In the first step, ZnO nanorod (NR) arrays were synthesised on glass substrates using a low temperature (95 °C), low cost and environmentally benign AGS method. ZnO NR arrays have a large surface area and serve as a template. In the second step, TiO2 nanowires (NWs) were controllably deposited on the top of ZnO NRs using a magnetron sputter at ambient temperature. The photoluminescence property, the annealing effect and the phase transformation on the microstructure of the ZnO/TiO2 core–shell samples have been presented in our previous works.22 In this paper, the microstructure, the growth mechanism and the surface electronic states of ZnO/TiO2 core–brush nanostructure were systematically studied. The photocatalytic evaluation results, including photocatalytic performance under both UV and visible-light irradiation were also demonstrated. We show that large-scale ZnO/TiO2 hetero-nanorod arrays with polycrystalline TiO2 NWs coated uniformly on the ZnO NRs, so called core–brush (CB), were successfully fabricated. The unique ZnO/TiO2 CB shows significant photocatalytic enhancement over TiO2 film, ZnO/TiO2 two-layer thin films under UV and visible light irradiation. In addition, immobilizing CB on the solid substrate, the ZnO/TiO2 CB catalysis shows excellent durability. This will not only avoid nanoparticle recovery process, which is yet another concern about using nanosized photocatalysts in real life, but also significantly reduce the amount of the active photocatalyst. Our results suggest that these unique composite nanoarchitectures could be a promising class of photocatalyst candidates for organic contaminant degradation.
2. Results and discussions
2.1. Morphology and structure

Fig. 1a presents a typical SEM cross-sectional view of the ZnO NR arrays grown on a glass substrate via an aqueous solution growth process at 95 °C for 4 h. Polyethylenimine (PEI) was used as a capping reagent to control the growth of ZnO NRs with a high aspect ratio and large surface area.23 The ZnO NRs, vertical to the substrate, have a length typically ranging from ∼200 to 1000 nm and a diameter of ∼100 nm. The average aspect ratio (length to diameter) of the rods is about 80. After sputtering TiO2 on top of the ZnO NRs for 90 min, ZnO/TiO2 rods with a baseball-bat like structure were formed, as shown in Fig. 1b. The TiO2 layers, composed of small clusters, appear to be furry and porous.

Fig. 1c shows the EDS spectra of ZnO NRs and ZnO/TiO2 composite structures, respectively. Typically, Zn, O and Ti peaks were found after deposition of TiO2. The Si and Ca peaks should come from the glass substrate. The concentrations of Ti element (wt. %) were determined to be ∼9.2% in the structures prepared with 90 min of sputtering.
To understand the microstructure of the ZnO/TiO2 composite structures, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were performed. Fig. 2 shows TEM/HRTEM images of a ZnO/TiO2 CB nanostructure fabricated by aqueous solution growth of ZnO NRs followed by magnetron sputtering deposition of TiO2 NWs at ambient temperature for 90 min. Fig. 2a demonstrates that the ZnO/TiO2 composite structure has ZnO NRs as a core and close packed TiO2 NWs as the outside layer. Fig. 2b clearly shows that the TiO2 NWs at the top of the ZnO NRs have a length of 10–20 nm and a diameter of ∼2–3 nm. The TiO2 NWs show parallel growth to each other on the ZnO surface like a comb. This is the reason why it was named as a core–brush (CB) nanostructure. The angle between the TiO2 NWs and the ZnO side surface is about 60–80°. HRTEM images and the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns reveal that the ZnO rod is of a single-crystal with a preferential growth direction along the [0001] direction (Fig. 2b), and TiO2 NWs show polycrystalline phases of rutile TiO2 with a (110) interplanar space of 0.319 nm and anatase TiO2 with a (101) interplanar space of 0.343 nm (Fig. 2c). The orientation information and crystalline structure of ZnO/TiO2 CB was further confirmed in the XRD results shown in Fig. 3. The strong and narrow (002) diffraction peak indicates ZnO as having a preferential crystal growth along the orientation of [0001]. Diffraction patterns of TiO2 show a multi-phased structure including both anatase and rutile TiO2 phases. It is worth noting that the fine TiO2 NWs have polycrystalline phases which can be deposited by the magnetron sputter on ZnO NRs at ambient temperature. Without high temperature reactive sputtering or post-annealing treatment, the deposition of TiO2 nanostructures can be controlled more easily.

2.2. 
          X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
The XPS spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. 4. The Zn 2p, O 1s, Ti 2p and C 1s (contaminant) can be easily observed in the full spectra (Fig. 4a). The binding energies (BE) of the various peaks obtained from the fitting procedures are listed in Table 1 for the ZnO NR and ZnO/TiO2 CB sample (90 min deposition), and the binding energies were calibrated by taking the carbon C 1s peak (284.8 eV) as a reference. Fig. 4b shows the fine scan spectra of Ti 2p. For the ZnO/TiO2 CB sample, the locations of BE of Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 centred at 465.7 eV and 460.0 eV are in good agreement with the values of Ti4+ assigned in a TiO lattice.24 Formation of TiO2 is consistent with the TEM results. Compared to standard Ti 2p peak locations, which are 2p1/2 at 464.3 eV and 2p3/2 at 458.5 eV, the Ti 2p peaks of the ZnO/TiO2 CB sample are shifted to higher values. The reasons causing this BE difference may be due to a particle size effect and interface effects between TiO2 NWs and ZnO NRs.25

XPS analysis of the Zn 2p region revealed an asymmetrical nature of the 2p3/2 peak (Fig. 4c). The best fitting curves for ZnO/TiO2 CB sample show two peaks: the higher BE peak (ZnH) (lower intensity) at 1022.6 eV and the lower BE peak (ZnL) (higher intensity) at 1020.8 eV, respectively. Islam et al.26 attributed that the asymmetry of Zn 2p3/2 in an Al doped ZnO film was due to the presence of excess zinc in the films. In our case, however, this asymmetry may not be attributed to existing metal zinc in the samples. Apart from the different synthesis process, the 2p3/2 peak characteristics are different. Zn 2p3/2 lines for Zn and ZnO were reported at 1021.4 eV and 1021.7 eV in single crystal ZnO.27 The splitting (ΔBE) between these two standard peaks is 0.3 eV. But ΔBE between ZnH and ZnL is 1.8 eV. The full-width at half maximum (FWHM) value can be used to determine the chemical state of the oxide and metal based on a larger FWHM oxide peak compared to the metal. According to the literature,25 the FWHM values of Zn(II) oxide and Zn(0) 2p3/2 are 1.60 eV and 0.86 eV (20 eV pass energy), respectively. But the FWHM values of ZnL and ZnH are 1.48 eV and 1.75 eV, respectively. Therefore, we can conclude that the asymmetry in our observations is not due to existing Zn(0) in the samples. The reason behind this asymmetry of Zn 2p3/2 in our results could lie in the presence of Zn interstitial defect in ZnO NRs and chemical impurities different from Zn(II) after deposition of TiO2 NWs. Changes in local chemical environment because of the impurity also give rise to small shifts in the peak positions in the spectrum, so-called chemical shifts. This was further proved by the observed Zn 2p3/2 peaks: the 2p3/2 of ZnO/TiO2 CB shifted towards higher BE than that of the ZnO NR sample (Table 1).

Fig. 4d shows the XPS spectra of the O 1s region. The fitting of the experimental curves gives two peaks. The peak with the higher energy originated from oxygen in the oxygen deficient region.28 The second higher peak may have contributed from a defective oxide component or hydroxide component inherent in the oxide surfaces.25 The O 1s peak of ZnO/TiO2 CB also shows an obvious shift to lower binding energy compared with that of ZnO NR, a change of ∼0.6 eV. This change may be due to the formation of Zn–O–Ti cross-linking bond at the interface in a way that the photoelectrons created in the Ti atoms bonded to O2− ions shared with the Zn atoms at the interface should be more efficiently mobilized than those generated in Ti ions of a pure TiO2 material. This is reasonable because it is generally accepted that the mobility of positive charge is faster in ZnO than that in TiO2 (ZnO has better conductivity than TiO2). This similar feature was presented by Lassaletta and Fernandez for a quantum-sized TiO2 supported on silica samples.29 In their case, in contrary, the O 1s peaks shifted to the higher binding energy. They have assigned that this change may arise from a decrease in positive charge on Ti atoms in the initial state due to formation of cross-linking Ti–O–Si bonds at the interface (electrons in silica are less mobile than electrons in TiO2). The appearance of the O 1s peak shift attributed to the formation of the cross-linking O bonds (Ti–O–N) has also been observed in a titanium oxynitride system.30
Another important consideration is related to the geometry of the oxygen coordination around Ti in ZnO/TiO2 CB samples. It has been reported that titanium is present in the form of tetrahedral Ti–O units in TiO2-oxide composites.31 As shown in the paper, the presence of such tetrahedral coordination around Ti should induce changes in the XPS data and also the band gap shift which will be discussed in the next section.
2.3. 
          UV-vis spectrophotometry

The UV-vis transmission spectra of TiO2 film, ZnO/TiO2 film and ZnO/TiO2 CB structures are shown in Fig. 5a. The transmissions of ZnO/TiO2 CB samples are lower than those of the films. It is believed that the rough surface of the CB samples scatter part of the light, causing the transmittance of these samples to decrease. One sharp absorption edge appears for the TiO2 film at 320 nm, while two absorption edges could be observed in the range of 320–370 nm, which are original absorption edges of ZnO and TiO2. The obvious red shifts were also observed for ZnO/TiO2 CB samples, particularly for the CB deposited for 90 min, a broad absorption band formed around 450 nm to 550 nm. These results prove that the absorption edge of ZnO/TiO2 CB nanostructures have moved to the visible spectrum range, which indicates that the CBs are sensitive to visible light. The optical band gap Eg can be determined from the absorption coefficient α, and has been investigated by plotting (αhν)1/2vs. hν (for indirect allowed transitions) and (αhν)2vs. hν (for direct allowed transitions). Since the experimental result and theoretical calculations all suggested that ZnO and TiO2 have a direct forbidden gap.32 The optical band gap energy (Eg) of the samples can be estimated from a plot of (αhν)2versusphoton energy (eV), as shown in Fig. 5b. The estimated Eg are also summarized in Table 2. The direct optical band gap of the CB samples decreases from 3.39 eV at the deposition time of 30 min to 3.03 eV at the deposition time of 60 min, then to 2.64 eV at the deposition time of 90 min. In Fig. 5b the intercepts give two straight lines occurring at 3.64 eV and 3.00 eV for the ZnO/TiO2 film and 3.39 eV and 2.90 eV for the ZnO/TiO2 CB (30 min), respectively. The obvious red shift of optical band gap is seen in CB samples with the increase of the deposition time.

This large red shift in optical band energy gap is considered to be attributed to several factors. The first comes from the mixture effect of the band gap of the composite semiconductor. When TiO2 with a relative high band gap combines with low band gap ZnO, the band gap of the composite ZnO/TiO CB will be further narrowed, i.e. shifted to a lower energy compared with ZnO and TiO2. According to XRD and TEM results, the polycrystalline TiO2 composed of both anatase and rutile phases which contain different energy band gaps leads to a different excitation energy for the CB samples.33 However, because the band gap difference between ZnO and TiO2 as well as anatase and rutile are relatively small, it might not cause such a large shift of the band gap (about 1.10 eV between TiO2 film and ZnO/TiO2 CB 30 min). The second factor is due to the interface effect between the ZnO and TiO2 nanostructures. This includes the formation of tetrahedral coordination around Ti and increasing the dielectric confinement effect at the interface.34 In addition, the red shift might also be attributed to an increased surface area after deposition of TiO2 NW on ZnO NR surface. It has been proposed that increased surface area of nanostructures provide surface states within the band gap to effectively reduce the band gap.33,35
The ZnO/TiO2 CB nanostructures have an overall lower energy band gap than other films. The lower band gap has a positive effect on the photocatalytic activity because photocatalytic reactions can be activated by photons with lower energy.36
2.4. 
          Growth mechanism

          Growth of ZnO NRs is the first step for the formation of the ZnO/TiO2 CB nanoarchitectures. Hydrothermal growth of ZnO nanostructure using Zn nitrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT, C6H12N4) in aqueous solution has been widely reported.37 In the present study, polyethylenimine (PEI) is used in the ZnO NR growth process. PEI has been recognized as an efficient surface modifying reagent, which could be preferentially adsorbed to the side surface of the ZnO NRs, thus affecting the surface free energy and growth rate.38ZnO NRs prepared in this study have a spade-like top morphology rather than a normal hexagonal shape. This may have been caused by the PEI absorption on the crystal faces.38
In order to investigate the growth process and mechanism of the outer layer TiO2 NWs, samples synthesised with different sputtering times were characterized using TEM as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6a shows a typical ZnO NR before deposition of TiO2. The ZnO NR is a single-crystal and has a smooth surface. After 30 min sputtering of TiO2, a thin layer of TiO2 particles covered the surface of ZnO NRs (Fig. 6b). The thickness of the TiO2 layer is estimated to be 2–3 nm. The rod tip is covered by more TiO2 particles than the side surface. This is because the top surfaces of the ZnO rods were facing directly towards the TiO2 target during the deposition and the rod tip area could receive more TiO2. Since ZnO NR arrays are closely packed (Fig. 1), TiO2 particles experience difficulty in reaching the bottom part of the ZnO NRs. Fig. 6c and 6d show the morphologies of the samples obtained at deposition times of 60 and 90 min, respectively. It can be seen that dense and fine TiO2 NWs formed on the surface of the ZnO NRs. Again the TiO2 NWs on the top of the ZnO NRs are longer than those on the side of the ZnO NRs due to more mass transformation. There are very limited TiO2 NWs grown on the lower part and bottom of the ZnO NRs. After 90 min deposition, the length of TiO2 NWs on top of the ZnO NRs is up to ∼20 nm. Based on the time dependent results, the growth rate of TiO2 NWs on top of the ZnO NRs is relative low at ∼10–15 nm h−1 in the current experimental conditions.

          Magnetron sputtering is a popular technique for the deposition of amorphous TiO2 thin films.39 Since crystalline TiO2 is more active as a photocatalyst than amorphous TiO2 films,37 researchers have tried to deposit crystalline TiO2 films at relatively low temperatures without post-deposition thermal annealing.40,41 However, substrate heating (>200 °C) or high power density sputtering is still needed.41,42 The sputtering deposition process used in this research does not require substrate heating. It is interesting to see that the polycrystalline TiO2 NWs were formed instead of an amorphous film on top of the ZnO NRs. To further understand the growth mechanism of TiO2 NWs, the microstructure of the TiO2 outer-layer at an early growth stage (30 min of sputtering) was characterized using HRTEM (Fig. 7). Fig. 7a shows TiO2 nuclei layer on the surface of a ZnO NR. It clearly shows that TiO2 nanocrystals have various orientations and random distributions on the surface of the ZnO NR. It has been reported when Ar was used as the working gas and TiO2 as the target in the magnetron sputtering process, sputtered fragments were mainly Ti atoms and compound species of TiO2 but lack O−.43 In our case, the O ions in the surface of the single crystal ZnO NRs provide an extra O− for TiO2 nucleation. The polycrystallinity of the TiO2 nuclei layer is caused by lattice mismatch and defects of the ZnO NR (e.g. O vacancy). The initial growth starts when an extra TiO2 particle reaches the nuclear sites (Fig. 7b). Consequently, sputtered TiO2 fragments, which contain both anatase and rutile phases, subsequently attaches one by one on the “top” position to finally form TiO2 NWs (Fig. 7c). It can be seen that the growth process of polycrystalline TiO2 NW follows a “particle-by-particle” mechanism rather than a layer-by-layer mechanism. This may be due to the formation of random crystal TiO2 nuclei sites on the ZnO surface and the following attach and growth process is a more energy favourable process. Furthermore, the low energy sputtering process at ambient temperature leads to the formation of TiO2 nanostructure with a relatively low growth rate at only ∼10–15 nm h−1. This will benefit the formation of TiO2 NW structures instead of a dense thin film.

2.5. Photocatalytic activity
The photocatalytic decomposition of Bromo-Pyrogallol Red (Br-PGR) under UV (245 nm) and visible-light (450 nm) irradiation was used to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the ZnO/TiO2 CB samples. A pure TiO2 film and TiO2/ZnO composite film were used for comparison. Absorbance, an indication of Br-PGR concentration, was used to measure the extent of Br-PGR dye decomposition.
The photocatalytic kinetic of the heterogeneous photocatalysis can be analyzed using the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model44,45 r = kθ = kKC/(1 + KC0)(1)where r is the initial rate of disappearance of the organic substrate. k is the true rate constant under the given experimental conditions and θ the coverage of photocatalyst. K is the adsorption constant and C is the equilibrium bulk-solute concentration, and C0 is initial concentration. In order to better understand the reaction kinetics and obtain precious kinetic parameters, the dark adsorption and photodecomposition of various initial concentrations of Br-PGR in the presence of 0.2 mg ml−1ZnO/TiO2 CB were conducted (Fig. 8). At the lower initial concentration of ≤5.0 mg L−1, over 99% of Br-PGR remains in solution after 220 min dark adsorption; even at the higher initial concentration of ≥7.5 mg L−1, over 95% of Br-PGR still remains in solution after 220 min dark adsorption. It is clear that Br-PGR experiences almost no adsorption on the ZnO/TiO2 CB film at a lower initial concentration but decreases in concentration due to subsequent UV illumination. In the current reaction conditions, since the initial concentration is low (C0 = 2.0 mg L−1 = 3.583 × 10−6 mol L−1) and the dye is obviously not adsorbed on the ZnO/TiO2 CB film at lower initial concentration, the term KC (eqn (1)) in the denominator can be neglected with respect to unity. The rate becomes, therefore, a first order equation, r = −dc/dt = kKc = kac(2)where ka is the apparent pseudo-first-order rate constant. The integral form c = f(t) of the rate equation is ln(C0/C) = kat(3)

Therefore, the photocatalytic degradation can be quantitatively evaluated by comparing the apparent reaction rate constants ka, which can be obtained from the plots of ln(C0/C) versus irradiation time (t).

Fig. 9 shows the results of photodecomposition of Br-PGR under UV (245 nm) irradiation. Fig. 9a shows the relation of the light absorbance and UV irradiation time for a ZnO/TiO2 CB sample after 90 min sputtering. The Br-PGR showed a major absorption band at 546 nm. The absorbance is gradually reduced with increased UV irradiation time. Fig. 9b shows the Br-PGR decomposition rate as a function of UV irradiation time. A blank glass substrate, TiO2 thin film, TiO2/ZnO composite film and ZnO/TiO2 CB sample (90 min sputtering) were tested for 210 min under identical conditions. C0 and C are the concentrations of Br-PGR before and after UV irradiation, respectively. It can be seen that 80% of Br-PGR was degraded by the ZnO/TiO2 CB sample after 210 min UV irradiation. This was contrasted with 32% and 36% degradation by pure TiO2 and composite TiO2/ZnO films, respectively. In the absence of a catalyst, decomposition of Br-PGR under the same UV irradiation condition is negligible. These results clearly demonstrate that the ZnO/TiO2 CB has significantly improved photocatalytic properties in comparison with TiO2 or TiO2/ZnO films. According to eqn (3), the pseudo-first-order rate constants of the degradation can be calculated from the data plotted in Fig. 9c. They are 0.764%, 0.200% and 0.157% min−1 for the ZnO/TiO2 CB, TiO2/ZnO film and TiO2 film, respectively. It is obvious that photodegradation using ZnO/TiO2 CB samples has a much higher reaction rate than those using other catalysts under identical testing conditions.

The visible-light photocatalytic activity of ZnO/TiO2 CB was evaluated by photodecomposition of Br-PGR under visible light (450 nm) irradiation with comparison to TiO2 and TiO2/ZnO films (Fig. 10). Fig. 10a shows that the absorbance of the Pr-BGR solution with ZnO/TiO2CB film is gradually reduced with increased irradiation time. For comparison, photocatalytic activities of a blank sample (without catalyst), TiO2 film and TiO2/ZnO film were also tested under identical experimental conditions. As shown in Fig. 10b, ZnO/TiO2 CB exhibits obvious visible-light activity for decomposition of Pr-BGR. After 210 min reaction, 40.5% Pr-BGR have been degraded by the CB sample (90 min sputtering). In contrast, the TiO2 film and TiO2/ZnO film show no obvious visible-light photocatalytic activity for the decomposition of Pr-BGR. There is over 95% Pr-BGR still existing in the solution after the same period of reaction. The blank sample testing result shows that the photodecolouration under the visible-light irradiation at current experimental conditions can be negligible. The pseudo-first-order rate constants of the degradation reaction obtained from Fig. 10c are 0.247%, 0.041% and 0.0046% min−1 for the ZnO/TiO2 CB, TiO2/ZnO film and TiO2 film, respectively. These results clearly indicate that ZnO/TiO2 CB has visible-light photocatalytic activity compared with TiO2/ZnO film and TiO2 film.

The results of enhanced photocatalytic activity of the ZnO/TiO2 CB nanostructure may be attributed to the following reasons. According to XPS and UV-vis results (Fig. 4 & 5), it is evident that the interaction between ZnO and TiO2 nanostructures is responsible for the efficient generation and separation of electron–hole pairs generated by means of band gap excitation, which is a key to influencing a photocatalytic reaction. When the ZnO/TiO2 CB heterostructure was used as the photocatalyst, the photo-induced electron transfer occurs from the conduction band of ZnO to the conduction band of TiO2 and conversely, the hole transfer can take place from the valence band of TiO2 to the valence band of ZnO. ZnO and TiO2 may have a coupling effect that increases the interfacial charge-transfer rate.45 Therefore, the photo-induced electron–hole pairs could be separated effectively and the lifetime of the charge carriers is increased. In this way, the recombination rates of the electron–hole pairs can be reduced and the photocatalytic reaction improved. The enhanced photocatalytic activity due to the vectorial transfer of electrons and holes, which takes place in coupled semiconductors processing different redox energy levels for their corresponding conduction and valence bands, has also been found in ZnO/TiO2 composite nanoparticles and BiOI/TiO2 heterostructures.46 The red shift of the absorption edge shown in the UV-vis spectra (Fig. 5) indicates that the ZnO/TiO2 CB nanostructure has a lower energy band gap than that of pure TiO2 and composite TiO2/ZnO films. The visible-light photocatalytic activity of the CB sample is mainly attributed to the extension of the absorption to the visible range, which means that photons with energies lower than UV can partially activate the catalyst.20 On the other hand, the unique core–brush morphology could be beneficial to higher the photocatalytic activity. The ZnO/TiO2 CB with mesoporous structure favor the adsorption of reactant molecules, as well as light harvesting due to the large surface area and multiple scattering.47 Moreover, wire-like nanosized TiO2 that were found to consist of smaller crystallites (as determined from the TEM/HRTEM data) guarantee a higher density of active sites available for surface reactions as well as higher interfacial charge carrier transfer rate.48
Finally, the photocatalytic durability of the ZnO/TiO2 CB was tested. Fig. 11 shows the cyclic photodegradation of B-PGR using one ZnO/TiO2 CB sample. After ten cycles the sample still maintained relatively high photocatalytic activity. This unique core–brush structure is expected to have a long service life. TiO2 is more chemically stable compared with ZnO, which is sensitive to both acidic and basic solutions (chemical corrosion), thus the outer TiO2 layer can serve as a protective layer for the inner ZnO nanorods in solutions. In addition, TiO2 can also prevent the photocorrosion of ZnO under UV light irradiation. Photocorrosion is a major obstacle for photocatalysts such as ZnO and CdS but not for TiO2.49 Thus, this hierarchical structure could work as both an efficient and durable photocatalyst.

3. Experimental
3.1. 
          Sample preparation


          ZnO/TiO2 CB samples were prepared by a combination of aqueous solution growth of ZnO NRs and magnetron sputtering TiO2 NWs on the glass substrates (10 × 10 mm) with a ZnO seed layer pre-deposited by a magnetron sputter. The substrate preparation followed the process described in our previous work.4 The glass substrates with ZnO seeds were immersed in an aqueous solution of 80 mL 0.025 mol L−1zinc nitrate (Zn(NO)3·6H2O, 98%) and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) (C6H12N4, 99%) with a molar ratio of 1:1, and 2 ml 10% polyethylenimine (PEI). PEI was used as a capping reagent to control the growth of ZnO NRs with a high aspect ratio.25 This solution was kept at 95 °C for 4 h in a sealable glass bottle. Afterwards, the glass slides were withdrawn from the solution, rinsed with DI water, and dried at room temperature overnight.
For the deposition of the outer TiO2 layer (brush), the glass slides with ZnO NRs were mounted into an unbalanced magnetron sputtering unit installed with a TiO2 (99.99%) target. The background vacuum pressure of the sputtering chamber was 6.7 × 10−6 Pa. Argon gas (99.999%) was introduced into the chamber as the working gas with a flow rate of 10 cm3 min−1 and a pressure of 1.33 × 10−2 Pa. Before deposition, the target was pre-sputtered for 5 min to remove any surface contamination. During deposition, the substrates, without intentionally heating, were rotated at a speed of 3 revs/min. The deposition was performed for 30, 60 and 90 min.
The TiO2 film was prepared by magnetron sputtering of TiO2 on a glass substrate. The deposition parameters were the same as for the deposition of the outer TiO2 layer on the ZnO NRs and the deposition time was 90 min. The TiO2/ZnO composite film was prepared by first carrying out magnetron sputtering of ZnO film on a glass substrate. The deposition conditions were the same as for the pre-deposition of ZnO seed layer described in the preparation of ZnO/TiO2 part for the deposition time of 1 h. Secondly, deposition of the TiO2 film on top of the ZnO film followed the same procedure as the preparation of the TiO2 film on a glass substrate as mentioned previously.
3.2. Sample characterization
The structure and morphology of the synthesized ZnO/TiO2 CB products were characterized using a X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα (λ = 0.15418 nm), a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Philips XL-30S operating at 5 kV), a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Philips CM12 operating at 120 kV) and a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEOL JSE-300 operating at 300 kV). The composition of the samples were analysed with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS, Philips XL-30S operating at 20 kV). Surface electronic states were analyzed by X-ray photonelectron spectroscopy conducted at the Australian Synchrotron Centre (soft X-ray beam line with photon energy of 4–45 keV, Al Kα). The optical absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent 8453) at room temperature.
3.3. Photocatalysis

Decomposition of Bromo-Pyrogallol Red (Br-PGR) dye aqueous solution was used to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of ZnO/TiO2 CB and reference samples. In a typical test, the sample slide of 1 × 1 cm was immersed into 2 mL B-PGR solution with a concentration of 2.0 mg L−1 in a home-made photocatalysis reactor with UV prevention and cooling system. A mercury tube lamp (15 W, 245 nm) and a visible lamp (18 W, 450 nm) were used as a UV irradiation and visible-light source. The distance between the sample and light was kept at 10 cm. The irradiance intensity of the UV light (254 nm) was 414.40 mW cm−2 and visible light (450 nm) was 46.74 mW cm−2 at the surface of the dye solution. Before exposing the sample to the light source, the dye solution was stirred thoroughly with the catalyst slide in the dark for 30 min to reach the adsorption equilibrium of the dye on the catalyst. The change of B-PGR concentration with irradiation time was measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent 8453). The intensity of the absorption band peak (546 nm) was recorded against time.
The TiO2 and TiO2/ZnO composite films were used as reference catalysts to compare the photocatalytic performance of ZnO/TiO2 CB.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a heterostructure ZnO/TiO2 CB nanostructure has been successfully synthesized through a two-step process combining solution growth of ZnO and magnetron sputtering deposition of TiO2. This structure has a core–brush morphology composed of crystalline TiO2 nanowires on aligned ZnO nanorods. This unique heterostructure was formed through a sequence nucleation followed by a “particle-by-particle” growth mechanism. The interaction effect between ZnO and TiO2 could promote the transfer of photo-induced electron and thus inhibit their recombination with holes. The presence of ZnO/TiO2 CB could also extend the optical spectral response range. In addition to the existence of a large amount of active reaction sites, which enable the heterostructure to exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity compared with normal TiO2 film and TiO2/ZnO composite film, the CB nanostructure also shows excellent durability in the decomposition of organic dye.
With comparison to ordinary nano-sized powder catalysts, this composite film with a core–brush nanostructure has particular advantages for real applications in terms of high efficiency, long life time and low cost. TiO2 NWs were immobilized onto the surface of aligned ZnO NR arrays. No separation or recovery process is necessary when ZnO/TiO2 CBs catalysts are used in water or air purification processes. Recovery of catalysts in the form of nanoparticles from the reaction system is a big concern in industrial applications.11 This heterostructure may also demonstrate other interesting photochemical and optoelectronic properties which will be the topic of further studies.
