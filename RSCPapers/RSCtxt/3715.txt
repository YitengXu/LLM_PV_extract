    , Accepted 24th October 2017First published on 27th October 2017AbstractWe have, for the first time, reported a highly efficient MP–(Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 luminescent material for application in optoelectronic devices. MP–(Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 with red-emitting Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphor is applied to an InGaN blue chip and compared with green-emitting (Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs). MP–(Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 achieves a conversion efficiency of 80.9 lm W−1 under a forward-bias current of 150 mA. We propose MP–(Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 as a promising green-emitting material that can replace the conventional inorganic phosphor.
White light emitting diodes (WLEDs) have attracted global attention for broad applications such as the backlight of displays and lighting technology because of their advantages of having a long service time, applicability for compact devices, low power consumption and being environmentally friendly.1,2 The general route for the generation of highly efficient white light is to use Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ yellow phosphor with an InGaN blue emitting chip.3 However, this method is insufficient because of the pale white light caused by the lack of green and red components.4,5 Quantum dots (QDs) have been considered as a promising luminescent material due to their narrow emission bandwidth, high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and high stability, as well as change in the emission wavelength from blue to red as a function of QD size.6,7 However, cadmium (Cd)-based QDs have various issues for practical applications. Cd-based QDs are synthesized under very difficult conditions such as high temperature and long reaction times, and passivation of core materials is needed for surface passivation.8,9 Organic–inorganic hybrid metal-halide perovskite materials have recently been intensively used for substitution of Cd-based QDs. The materials commonly used are CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite materials.10,11 The CH3NH3PbX3 perovskite materials are suitable for use in optoelectronic devices due to their broad absorption spectra, high PLQYs, inexpensive solution process, and easy synthetic routes.12 Importantly, with CH3NH3PbX3 perovskite materials, it is possible to adjust the emission wavelength from 780 nm (X = I) to 530 nm (X = Br) to 410 nm (X = Cl) by controlling the bandgap.13,14 However, to the best of our knowledge, the lack of stability of CH3NH3PbX3 has been considered as an issue for overcoming the above problems.15 Recently, inorganic cesium lead halide (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) materials have been shown to be attractive candidates due to their high luminous efficiency, high stability and quantum confinement effects compared to CH3NH3PbX3 perovskite materials.16,17 While inorganic cesium lead halides are more stable than organic–inorganic hybrid counterparts, several studies using inorganic matrixes have been reported to further improve stability for LED applications.18–20 Grätzel et al. reported the incorporation of rubidium cations into perovskite solar cells and obtained an efficiency of 21.6%. The ionic radii of Cs and Rb are 167 pm and 152 pm, respectively.21 We suggest that if the Rb ion is substituted in the Cs site, the emission wavelength shifts to the blue region. In the case of inorganic phosphor, the emission wavelength shifts as a function of the difference of ionic radii.22,23 Here, we have, for the first time, reported green-emitting (Cs1−xRbx)PbBr3 perovskite NCs as promising candidates for application in optoelectronic devices. The emission properties of (Cs1−xRbx)PbBr3 perovskite NCs are significantly dependent on the substitution of the Rb cations in the Cs cation site. (Cs1−xRbx)PbBr3 perovskite NCs were applied as a luminescence source in the electroluminescence of LEDs. The optimized contents of (Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 displayed outstanding PLQYs and 1931 Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates for device performance. Also, we propose a simple method for thermally stable perovskite NCs with commercial mesoporous silica, whose pore size is about 7–10 nm. A schematic of the synthetic route of the (Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 embedded mesoporous silica composite (denoted as MP–(Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3) is shown in Fig. 1.

To confirm whether the perovskite NCs were perfectly synthesized, we measured the X-ray diffraction patterns with various Cs/Rb ratios as shown in Fig. 2. The (Cs1−xRbx)PbBr3 perovskite NCs were crystallized due to the phase transformation of cubic to octahedral crystals upon incrementally increasing the Rb+ to Cs+ ratio. Also, as the tolerance factor decreases, a greater octahedral tilting occurs to maintain the perovskite framework.24 The ionic radii of Cs+ and Rb+ are 167 pm and 152 pm, respectively. The XRD peak is expected to shift to higher 2θ values if Rb+ is substituted in the Cs+ site. With increasing Rb+ substitution, specific 2θ ranges are enhanced, showing the extent of octahedral tilting.21,25 This means that, as the amount of Rb+ substituted in the Cs+ site increases, the lattice parameter becomes more distorted and the overall cell volume decreases. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to confirm the morphology and the particle size of (Cs1−xRbx)PbBr3 perovskite NCs, as shown in Fig. S1(a and b) (ESI†). The as-prepared perovskite NCs exhibited good monodispersity and retained their cubic shape, and their average size was about 15 nm. The lattice fringes of ∼0.575 nm in the high resolution TEM image (Fig. S1(b), ESI†) matched well with the value for the (200) plane, further confirming the highly crystalline perovskite NCs (see the corresponding fast Fourier transformation image in Fig. S1(a) inset, ESI†). Also, a TEM image of MP–(Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

Furthermore, the XPS analysis of (Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 was performed to further investigate the chemical elemental composition. Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the high resolution XPS spectra of the Rb 3d and Cs 3d atoms, respectively. The binding energy curves of Cs 3d3/2 and Cs 3d5/2 are observed at 737.8 eV and 723.9 eV, respectively. Also, the peaks of Rb 3d3/2 and Rb 3d5/2 are located at 111.2 eV and 109.7 eV, respectively. For detailed information, the XPS peak areas of the survey spectra and element concentrations are shown in Fig. S3 and Table S1 (ESI†).

The basic luminous characteristics of (Cs1−xRbx)PbBr3 perovskite NCs are presented in Fig. 4(a)–(d). The PL spectra of the different Cs/Rb ratios are shown in Fig. 4(a). Generally, the optical band gap of QDs can be controlled by changing their size and their ratio of the composition. In the case of perovskite NCs such as CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), it is more feasible to adjust the optical band gap by controlling the chemical composition. The optical band gap can be finely tuned from the visible to near infrared region. Upon increasing the Rb value in the Cs site, the emission spectra are changed from 532 nm to 509 nm due to the different ionic radii, which indicate the change in the emission wavelength to the blue region with the band gap energy, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). In addition, as a function of the increase of the x value, (Cs1−xRbx)PbBr3 perovskite NCs have a highly bright colour under 365 nm. Fig. 4(b) depicts the CIE colour space coordinates for the (Cs1−xRbx)PbBr3 perovskite NCs with increasing x value. Compared to the CIE colour space coordinates of the CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs, those for the prepared (Cs1−xRbx)PbBr3 perovskite NCs are shown in the high purity green region. Our sample could be considered as a candidate for next generation displays with high colour reproduction. The overall luminous characteristics with FWHM, PLQY and CIE coordinates are shown in Table 1. Fig. 4(c) presents a comparison of the thermal stabilities between the (Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 perovskite NCs and MP–(Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3. The temperature range is from 25 °C to 150 °C. The relative emission intensity of MP–(Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 indicates a higher thermal stability than the (Cs1−xRbx)PbBr3 perovskite NCs. The emission intensity of MP–(Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 decreased to 35%. This result indicates that the mesoporous silica can efficiently prevent thermal degradation. Fig. 4(d) shows a photostability test of the MP–(Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 compared with (Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 NCs. The samples were exposed to a 365 nm UV lamp for 168 hours and measured at intervals of 24 hours. The relative intensity of the MP–(Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 composite decreased to only 80%, while the NCs decreased to around 20%. This indicates that the mesoporous silica can suppress well the photooxidation under a UV lamp. These results suggest that MP–(Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 can be applied to high power LEDs because of its thermal- and photostability for MP–(Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 perovskite NCs.

Fig. 5(a) presents the EL spectrum of MP–(Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 with red emitting Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphor on a blue LED chip. Under a forward-bias current of 20 mA, a CRI of 67.93 and a conversion efficiency of 41.54 lm W−1 were observed. As presented in Fig. 5(b), the conversion efficiency is measured as a function of increasing forward-bias current. The conversion efficiency increases with forward-bias current until 150 mA, and then decreases to 56.44 lm W−1 when operated under a forward-bias current of 250 mA. For application in white LEDs, the prepared sample was analyzed according to the CIE colour space coordinates as shown in Fig. 5(c). The practical feasibility of white light generation as down-conversion LEDs is demonstrated. The CCT value changed from 7312 K. Based on the CIE colour space coordinates, we suggest the use of displays and lighting technology with high quality green emitting MP–(Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3.

Conclusions
We successfully synthesized fully inorganic MP–(Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 as the candidate for a green-emitting luminescent material. High quality MP–(Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 materials with good thermal properties were compared with (Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 perovskite QDs. The highly efficient MP–(Cs0.4Rb0.6)PbBr3 material with red-emitting Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphor is applied to a blue-emitting InGaN LED chip, and a conversion efficiency of 80.9 lm W−1 is demonstrated under a forward-bias current of 150 mA. We suggest that our research can be applied to the next generation of green-emitting luminescent materials for optoelectronic devices.
