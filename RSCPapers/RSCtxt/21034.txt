    , Accepted 22nd March 2019First published on 25th March 2019AbstractHole-transport materials (HTMs) play a crucial role in determining the photovoltaic performance and long-term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), because they not only efficiently facilitate hole-extraction and transfer, but also act as a barrier to protect the perovskite from moisture and oxygen. So far, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 20% in PSCs have been mostly achieved by employing a Spiro-OMeTAD-based HTM. However, it suffers from some drawbacks such as relatively low hole-mobility, complicated synthesis and difficult purification, which hamper its potential commercial applications. Here, for the first time, two new easily accessible 9,9-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-substituted fluorene-based HTMs comprising H (YT1) and methoxyphenyl-fluorene (YT3) as the terminated groups have been synthesized for use in organic–inorganic hybrid and all-inorganic PSCs. The (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 and CsPbI2Br PSCs based on YT3 yield very impressive PCEs of 20.23% and 13.36%, respectively, both of which are higher than that of Spiro-OMeTAD (19.18% and 12.30%). More encouragingly, the YT3-based PSC displays good long-term stability for 600 hours. These results confirm that different terminated groups in HTMs show a significant effect on the energy levels, hole extraction and transfer, thin-film surface morphology and photovoltaic performance. Our findings could provide a useful insight for future rational design of HTMs for highly efficient and stable PSCs.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have captured extraordinary attention in the last few years owing to their excellent physical features of strong panchromatic light harvesting, long charge-carrier diffusion length and low-cost solution processabilities.1–6 Benefiting from the careful optimization of various perovskite components, interfacial protection strategies and the dramatic development of efficient HTMs,7–15 the certified record PCE of ∼23.7% has been achieved to date.16 In most reported PSCs devices with a conventional n–i–p or inverted p–i–n cell architecture, a perovskite light absorber is simply sandwiched between a hole transport material layer (HTM) and an electron transport material layer (ETM). In these PSCs devices, the HTM plays a very noteworthy role in determining the photovoltaic performance and long-term stability of PSCs, because HTMs not only efficiently extract holes from the photo-excited perovskite toward the cathode in order to decrease the charge recombination, but also act as a moisture barrier to block moisture and oxygen penetration.17–20 Generally, a successful HTM applied in PSCs should exhibit some crucial properties, such as well-aligned energy levels, sufficient hole-mobility, and a uniform film morphology.21–25 So far, commercially available 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxy-phenylamine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) has been proven to be the most efficient and widely used HTM in most highly performing PSCs. Moreover, the tedious multistep synthetic routes with a low yield and difficult purification process of Spiro-OMeTAD make it highly expensive, which restricts its large-scale potential commercialization in the future. In addition, Spiro-OMeTAD suffers from a relatively low hole-mobility of about ∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which results in low charge-carrier extracting/transporting efficiency in PSC devices.26–30 Hence, these aforementioned drawbacks have prompted the development of low-cost and high-efficiency HTMs as alternatives to Spiro-OMeTAD. Although a great number of new HTMs have been explored and applied in PSCs, only a few reported PSCs utilizing new HTMs show PCEs higher than 18%.31–35 Moreover, the relationship between the HTM molecular structure and photovoltaic properties in PSCs has so far not been well investigated.
Previously, we have reported the synthesis of YT2 and successfully employed it as a HTM in PSCs,8 and the material demonstrated a facile synthesis (two-step route with >90% total yield) and impressive photovoltaic performance in the PSC device, which suggested that the non-coplanar 9,9-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-substituted fluorene unit is a promising molecular building core in developing new HTMs for PSCs. In this work, two new HTMs differing in the terminated molecular structure (YT1 and YT3) were synthesized and applied in organic–inorganic hybrid and all-inorganic PSCs, as shown in Fig. 1. YT2 was utilized as a reference in this work as well. We then systematically investigated the influences of different terminated molecular groups (H for YT1, methoxy for YT2 and methoxyphenyl-fluorene for YT3) in HTMs on optical and redox properties, as well as their photovoltaic performances in PSCs. When used as a HTM in PSCs, YT3-based solar cells show a better photovoltaic performance than that of YT1 and YT2. The organic–inorganic hybrid and all-inorganic PSC devices fabricated with YT3 achieved PCEs up to 20.23% and 13.36% with excellent device long-term stability, respectively, under AM 1.5G illumination.

Results and discussion
The synthetic routes for the two new HTMs are presented in Scheme S1 of the ESI.† Initially, 2,7-dibromo-9,9-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9H-fluorene was coupled with diphenylamine in a Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction to produce YT1 in 96% yield. YT3 was synthesized with 90% yield through the BF3·OEt2-mediated Friedel–Crafts reaction of YT1 with 9-(4-methoxyphenyl)-9H-fluoren-9-ol. These two new compounds were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy (Fig. S1–S6†), and all the analytical data are in good agreement with the chemical structures.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of all HTMs YT1, YT2 and YT3 are illustrated in Fig. 2a and the photophysical data are listed in Table 1. The three HTMs in CH2Cl2 solution show similar absorption spectra in the range of 300–450 nm, which might be explained by the similar chemical structures. The maximum absorption peaks for YT1, YT2 and YT3 appeared at 379, 387 and 400 nm, respectively. Compared with YT2, YT3 displays a slight bathochromic shift, owing to the increase in the electron-donating ability by introducing the fluorene-terminated group, which strengthens the intramolecular charge transfer from the peripheral donor to the central core.36 Clearly, all compounds display weak absorption capacity in the visible region, thus they would not compete with the perovskite layer for light absorption in PSC devices.

To determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of all HTMs, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements were performed in CH2Cl2 solution (Fig. 2b). The energy level diagrams of these three HTMs are illustrated in Fig. 2c. The HOMO energy levels of YT1, YT2 and YT3 are determined to be −5.15, −5.18 and −5.21 eV, respectively, which are sufficiently higher than that of the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite material (−5.65 eV),8,9,28 thus allowing efficient transfer of perovskite-generated holes at the perovskite/HTM interface. Encouragingly, the change of electron-donating capability for the terminated group of the HTMs from H, methoxy to methoxyphenyl-fluorene resulted in a slightly decreased HOMO energy level, which is advantageous for offering a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) in PSC devices, because the Voc is theoretically determined by the energy difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the electrons in TiO2 and the HOMO energy level of the HTM.8,37 Moreover, the LUMO energy levels of these three HTMs are sufficiently higher than the conduction band of the perovskite (−4.05 eV), which can block the undesired electron back-transfer from the perovskite to the counter electrode, thus reducing the carrier recombination rate.38,39 The energy levels for all HTMs match well with the requirements for an efficient transfer of electrons and holes.
To further gain insight into the electronic properties of the three HTMs, the electron density distribution and hole reorganization energies (ER) of YT1, YT2 and YT3 were evaluated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level using the Gaussian 09 program. As depicted in Fig. S7,† the electron density of both the HOMOs and LUMOs of the three HTMs is predominantly distributed across the fluorene central core and triphenylamine segments, and the well-delocalized overlap between the HOMO and LUMO should be favorable for good hole-transfer in HTM films.11,38 In addition, the hole reorganization energies (ER) of YT1, YT2 and YT3 are calculated to be 157, 111 and 130 meV (Table 1), respectively, which are much lower than Spiro-OMeTAD (495 meV).8 These results indicate that YT1, YT2 and YT3 might show faster hole-transport capability in organic solid HTM films. Hole-mobility of the thin-film is a key justified parameter for a new HTM applied in PSCs. Herein, the hole-mobility of these HTMs was measured using space-charge-limited currents (SCLCs)9,40,41 (Fig. 2d) and the detailed measurements are presented in the ESI.† As displayed in Table 1, the hole-mobility of YT1, YT2 and YT3 is 9.87 × 10−5, 1.21 × 10−4 and 1.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The trend observed here is well consistent with the difference in the hole reorganization energies from DFT calculations. Notably, the mobility values obtained here for the three HTMs are slightly higher than that of the conventional HTM Spiro-OMeTAD (8.25 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1),8,42 suggesting that these materials may be suitable candidate HTMs for PSC applications.
The photovoltaic performances of the three HTMs were investigated in mesoscopic PSC devices (FTO/c-TiO2/meso-TiO2/(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/HTM/Au). A cross sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the YT3-based PSCsdevice is shown in Fig. S8.†Fig. 3a illustrates the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) simulated sunlight illumination and the key photovoltaic characteristic parameters are listed in Table 2. The cell based on YT1 produced a PCE of 17.66% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.61 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.10 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.71. Upon incorporation of methoxy as the terminated group, the YT2-based cell provided a slightly higher PCE of 18.51% with a Jsc of 22.85 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.11 V, and a FF of 0.73. When the methoxy terminated group in YT2 is replaced with the methoxyphenyl-fluorene group, a significant enhancement of Jsc, Voc, and FF is observed. As a result, the YT3-based cell achieved a champion PCE of 20.23% with a Jsc of 23.25 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.13 V, and a FF of 0.77. For comparison, Spiro-OMeTAD-based reference solar cell shows a Jsc of 23.04 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.11 V, and a FF of 0.75, yielding a PCE of 19.18%. As shown in Fig. S9,† all devices exhibited very little J–V hysteresis in different scanning directions. It is clearly found that the the molecular terminated group has an important influence on the final photovoltaic performance. The higher PCE for YT3-based PSCs than Spiro-OMeTAD could be ascribed to its lower HOMO energy level, better hole-extraction ability and less charge recombination and current leakage, which can be supported by dark J–V characteristics (Fig. S11†). The integrated Jsc from the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 3b) is 21.92 mA cm−2, 22.35 mA cm−2, 22.78 mA cm−2 and 22.56 mA cm−2 for YT1, YT2, YT3 and Spiro-OMeTAD, respectively, which agree well with the measured Jsc. Moreover, the stabilized PCEs of 17.64%, 18.04% and 20.26% for solar cells based on YT1, YT2 and YT3, respectively, were measured at the maximum power point (Fig. 3c). The reproducibility of device efficiencies is shown in Fig. 3d, which shows good reproducibility of the PCEs for PSCs based on the three HTMs. These superior results suggest that 9,9-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-substituted fluorine-based materials can serve as highly efficient HTMs for PSCs.

All-inorganic lead halide perovskites have been demonstrated to be promising photovoltaic materials owing to their excellent stability compared with traditional organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites. Herein, we also fabricated all-inorganic PSCs based on YT3 and Spiro-OMeTAD with the optimized device configuration of ITO/SnO2/ZnO2/CsPbI2Br/HTMs/MoO3/Ag.43 The J–V plots are depicted in Fig. 4 and their detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The YT3-based CsPbI2Br PSCs yielded a PCE of 13.36%, with a Voc of 1.20 V, a Jsc of 14.65 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.76. The reference Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC produced slightly lower performance with a PCE of 12.41%, with a Voc of 1.18 V, a Jsc of 14.21 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.74. A small hysteresis was observed for YT3 and Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs in the J–V curves (Fig. S10†). The IPCE spectrum of the best-performing devices was measured (Fig. 4b), wherein integrated Jsc values of 13.99 mA cm−2 and 13.65 mA cm−2 for YT3 and Spiro-OMeTAD were obtained, respectively, which are in good agreement with that obtained from the experimental J–V curves. Besides, we further evaluated the stabilized efficiencies of YT3 and Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs under maximum output power-point conditions (Fig. 4c). Both the HTM-based PSCs exhibited a highly stable power output. To confirm the reproducibility of YT3 and Spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs, 46 PSC devices were fabricated, as shown in Fig. 4d. It appears that the PCE for YT3-based PSCs has a fairly narrow distribution with a higher average PCE value of 13.16% compared with Spiro-OMeTAD (12.05%), demonstrating that the PSC devices based on YT3 present good reproducibility. Clearly, our present results suggest that YT3 as a HTM exhibited excellent photovoltaic performance in all-inorganic PSCs.

To better understand the reasons for the different performances in PSC devices, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed to study their hole-extraction at the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/HTM interface. As shown in Fig. 5a, the bare perovskite film without the HTM exhibits a strong PL emission. When the three HTMs were spin-coated onto the top of the perovskite film, the PL emissions were significantly quenched with respect to the bare perovskite film, indicating that effective hole extraction and transfer happened at the perovskite/HTM interfaces. And YT1, YT2 and YT3 show the quenching values of 89%, 94% and 97% compared to the original PL intensity, respectively, reflecting the most efficient hole-extraction and transfer capability at the YT3/perovskite interface, which is one of the reasons for the much higher Jsc value measured for the YT3-based PSC device as compared to that of the PSC devices based on YT1 and YT2. To further understand the charge transport kinetics in the PSC devices employing the three HTMs, transient photovoltage decay measurements were performed. Generally, a much slower photovoltage-decay response indicates more efficient charge-transport and a lower charge recombination rate, thus giving a higher Voc and photovoltaic performance in PSC devices.44,45 As shown in Fig. 5b, the open-circuit photovoltage decay in the sequence of YT1 > YT2 > YT3 agreed well with the measured Voc values in PSC devices. These results indicate that the modulation of the interfacial charge recombination in PSC devices can be achieved by altering the terminated groups of HTMs with the addition of the bulky methoxyphenyl-fluorene group. Therefore, the lower charge recombination rate may be the main reason for the higher Voc value of YT3-based PSC devices.

To get insight into the effect of different HTMs on the long-term stability of PSCs, aging tests were performed at a relative humidity of about 30–35% without any encapsulation. As shown in Fig. 6a, after 600 hours, the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 PSC based on YT3 is the best, retaining 90% of its initial PCE value whereas the PCEs of YT2 and YT1 decrease to 84% and 81% under the same conditions, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that YT3-based devices exhibited the best long-term stability. To explain the difference in long-term stability, the water contact angles on the surfaces of the three HTMs were measured. As shown in Fig. 4c, YT1 and YT2 exhibit the water contact angle of 81° and 85°, respectively, whereas the angle increases to approximately 103° for YT3. Thus, the better hydrophobicity of YT3 is extremely beneficial for improving the long-term stability of PSCs. We further studied the long-term stability of all inorganic PSCs based on YT3 and Spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 6d). The PCEs of the CsPbI2Br PSC based on YT3 were operational with 95% performance retention after 600 hours. In comparison, the Spiro-OMeTAD based device retained 87% of its original efficiency. Therefore, it can be concluded that the larger dimensional structure of YT3 can improve hydrophobicity, which in turn improves the PSC stability. The thin film morphology of the HTM layer is another important factor to be considered to achieve good stability and photovoltaic performance of PSCs. From the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images in Fig. 6d, the root mean-square (RMS) roughness values of YT1, YT2 and YT3 are 6.04 nm, 4.84 nm and 3.08 nm, respectively. As a result, the more compact and uniform HTM-YT3 film formation can act as a moisture and oxygen barrier for the degradation of PSCs under ambient conditions. Moreover, the good uniform thin film of the HTM could also result in a fast charge transport in the PSC devices and thus fast charge collection in the device.46,47

In conclusion, two new 9,9-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-substituted fluorene-based HTMs, termed YT1 and YT3, have been successfully explored for high-performance organic–inorganic hybrid and all-inorganic PSCs based on the reference material YT2. The (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 and CsPbI2Br PSCs devices fabricated with YT3 achieve very impressive PCEs of 20.23% and 13.36%, respectively, both of which are slightly higher than that of the doped Spiro-OMeTAD-based reference devices (19.18% and 12.30%) under the same working conditions. Moreover, the YT3-based PSC without encapsulation displays good long-term stability. We then systematically investigated the influences of different terminated molecular groups (H, methoxy to methoxyphenyl-fluorene) in HTMs on optical and redox properties, as well as their photovoltaic performance in PSCs. It is found that the introduction of bulky methoxyphenyl-fluorene as the terminated group resulted in low-lying HOMO levels, better hole extraction and transfer capability, lower charge-recombination rate and better film-forming ability. Our present studies could provide a new strategy for the proper design of new HTMs for highly efficient and stable PSCs in the future.
