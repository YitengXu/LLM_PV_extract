    , Accepted 13th July 2012First published on 16th July 2012AbstractHere we report the syntheses of low bandgap polymers based on benzobisthiadiazole (BBT), thiadiazoloquinoxaline (TQ) and pyrazinoquinoxaline (PQ) core structures with different aromatic substituents. The effects of changing core structures from BBT to PQ and also substituents from biphenyl and bithienyl on the photophysical, electrochemical and morphology of the polymers were studied. These polymers were incorporated into solar cell devices as donors, with PC[71]BM as acceptors, and their device performances were correlated with their properties. It was found that the effect of these structural changes has significant consequences on the overall device performances.
Introduction
Low bandgap polymers are of interest in current organic photovoltaic (OPV) research as high power conversion efficiency may be achieved from bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices using them as electron donors.1–4 Ideally, the materials used should have broad absorption spectra to ensure effective harvesting of the solar photons.2,5–7 In designing low bandgap polymers, the more common strategies involve using (1) alternating donor–acceptor units to induce intramolecular charge transfer and (2) the introduction of pro-quinoid units which promote quinoid character along the backbone.8,9 The main strategy used in designing polymers with broad absorption spectra, on the other hand, involves attaching conjugated side chains to the polymer main chains.10–13 To date, there is no report on the combined use of all three strategies to achieve low bandgap and broad absorption polymers.
Previously, we have reported the synthesis of benzo[1,2-c;4,5-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (BBT), [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline (TQ) and pyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline (PQ) based small molecules that show low bandgaps and broad absorption ranges.14 While the low bandgap character of the BBT derivative is due to the strong intramolecular charge transfer and quinoid character within the molecule, the broad absorption range of the TQ and PQ molecules is a consequence of their possessing conjugated side chains. A number of low bandgap polymers containing BBT, TQ and PQ units have been reported, some of which have shown promising results in OPV devices.15–23 In this paper, we report the synthesis of copolymers of these units with fluorene and their testing as donor materials in BHJ OPV devices. The effect of the conjugated side chains on these polymers upon their performance in OPV devices is discussed.
Results and discussion
Polymer syntheses
Compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, PQ1 and PQ2 were synthesized as previously reported.14,241 was combined with the tin reagent 2 by Stille coupling to yield the polymer pBBTF. For the syntheses of TQ polymers, 1 was partially reduced using iron in acetic acid, followed by condensation with diketone 3 or 4 to yield the dibromo TQ derivatives 5 and 6 respectively. Stille coupling of these molecules with 2 yielded the two polymers pTQ1F and pTQ2F. The dibromo derivatives of BBT, TQ1 and TQ2 were found to have limited solubilities and hence are not used for polymerization (Fig. 1). For the syntheses of PQ polymers, bromination of PQ1 and PQ2 using NBS in chloroform first yielded the monomers 7 and 8 respectively. Suzuki coupling of these with 9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-bis(boronic acid pinacol ester) yielded pPQ1F and pPQ2F, respectively.

The molecular weight of the polymers (Table 1) is modest and may be capable of optimization, e.g. through use of different catalysts or microwave heating. The syntheses of these polymers are shown in Scheme 1, and details of their physical and electrochemical characterization data can be found in Table 1. Optical bandgaps were calculated from the edges of absorption in the UV-Visible spectra which are shown in Fig. 2. There is excellent agreement between the solid state optical and electrochemical bandgaps for the polymers with exceptions in the case of polymers pPQ1F and pPQ2F. Geometry optimized structures of the dithienyl BBT, TQs and PQs, together with their calculated HOMOs and LUMOs, can be found in Fig. 3. The calculated values for PQs have been previously reported by us,25 whereas the values for the TQs were derived in the current work.

Photophysical and electrochemical properties
All five polymers showed a low bandgap with absorption up to ∼900 nm for pPQ1F and pPQ2F and ∼1000 nm for pBBTF, pTQ1F and pTQ2F in thin films (Fig. 2b). As expected, the bandgaps of the polymers are in the order BBT < TQ < PQ due to stronger intramolecular charge transfer arising from stronger electron accepting nature and quinoid forming ability.14,26,27pTQ2F and pPQ2F also showed a slightly lower bandgap than pTQ1F and pPQ1F respectively due to the higher conjugation of the bithienyls as compared to the biphenyls.25 The different substituents on TQ did not cause any significant change in the energy levels for the TQ polymers. However, a more pronounced effect on the absorption spectra was easily seen from the less obvious valley at ∼600 nm for pTQ2F as compared to pTQ1F. The same trend was observed for the absorption spectra of pPQ2F and pPQ1F respectively. On the other hand, the different substituents on PQ did cause significant change in the energy levels for PQ polymers. This is because the bithienyls now induce a larger torsional strain on the thiophenes at the quinoid positions than the biphenyls, and have larger contribution in the HOMO and LUMO in PQ than TQ, as shown in the density functional theory (DFT) in Fig. 3. Together with the inherent weaker quinoid character of PQ as compared to TQ, these resulted in a stronger substituent effect on the energy levels for the PQ polymers.
From solution to thin film, UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra (Fig. 2a and b) show insignificant bathochromic shifts for all the polymers at short wavelengths while higher shifts were observed at longer wavelengths. The BBT polymer showed the largest bathochromic shift of 89 nm while TQ and PQ polymers showed similar shifts from 57–62 nm. This higher bathochromic shift of pBBTF indicates that a higher aggregation of the polymer occurs in the solid state as compared to the TQ and PQ polymers.
Thin film XRD
The aromatic substituents, together with the alkyl groups, can affect the packing of the polymers by changing the interchain and π–π stacking distance. Thus XRD of the polymer thin films was measured as shown in Fig. 4. For pBBTF, the lack of these side groups and strong intermolecular S–N contacts allow individual polymer chains to come close together. Thus pBBTF showed a short interchain distance of 9.78 Å. Interestingly, no significant π–π stacking was observed, as one would expect highly planar polymer chains of pBBTF to show strong π–π stacking. Such an observation was previously reported by Yuen et. al. for other BBT polymers.28,29 Though we did not manage to obtain in-plane XRD for all of the polymers, we suspect that an edge-on configuration was generally present in BBT polymers which would account for their reported high charge mobilities.
 Fig. 4  Out-of-plane thin film XRD of BBT, TQ and PQ polymers dropcast from 1,2-dichlorobenzene on the SiO2/Si substrate. The data were normalized at the baseline. 
The TQ polymers displayed interchain distances of 16.61 Å and 10.26 Å for pTQ1F and 21.76 Å and 10.14 Å for pTQ2Fwhile the PQ polymers showed 22.77 Å and 8.21 Å for pPQ1F and 27.27 Å and 10.09 Å for pPQ2F. Due to the asymmetric nature of TQ units, there are three ways where the TQ polymers can arrange themselves: (1) head–head (thiadiazole–thiadiazole), (2) head–tail (thiadiazole-side groups) and (3) tail–tail (side groups-side groups). With reference to the polymers of symmetrical BBT and PQ units, the largest interchain distances for the TQ polymers should be a consequence of head–tail stacking since they are smaller than that of the PQ polymers, while the almost constant second interchain distance should be a result of head–head interaction for the TQ polymers since they match well with that of the BBT polymer. Such a head–head interaction has been observed previously in a TQ small molecule.30
Both TQ and PQ polymers showed a significant π–π stacking signal as compared to BBT polymers, which might suggest larger tilt or face-on configuration. This is in contrast with the TQ–acetylene based polymers reported by Dallos et. al. in which no clear indication of π–π stacking was noticeable.31 From TQ to PQ polymers, the increasing torsional strain between the aromatic substituents and the thiophenes at the quinoidal positions (see side view images of the TQ and PQ units in Fig. 3) prevents polymer chains from packing closely together, resulting in larger π–π stacking distances for PQ (pPQ1F – 4.35 Å, pPQ2F – 4.26 Å) as compared to TQ polymers (pTQ1F – 4.10 Å, pTQ2F – 3.96 Å).
The XRD pattern of a PQ small molecule (PQ1a in the ESI, Fig. S1†) that resembled a part of the monomer unit of pPQ1F showed similarity when the X-ray incident beam was vertical to the nanowires, with strong signals from the (001), and (210), (223) and (213) planes.32 The (001) plane corresponded to the intermolecular distance in the c-axis direction, while the (210), (223) and (213) planes corresponded more or less to the ππ stacking directions. When the X-ray beam was parallel to the nanowires, the XRD pattern showed the absence of these π–π stacking signals, indicating that the PQ small molecule was parallel to the X-ray beam. The vertical and parallel X-ray beam configurations resemble that of the out-of-plane and in-plane XRD. Inferring from these data, we can conclude that pPQ1F adopts a predominant face-on configuration on SiO2/Si. The crystal structure of PQ1a was said to be applicable to PQ2a32 which resembled a part of the monomer unit of pPQ2F (see ESI Fig. S1†). Comparing with the XRD pattern of PQ2a (see ESI of ref. 23), we thus conclude that pPQ2F adopts a predominant edge-on configuration on SiO2/Si.
The intensity ratio of π–π stacking and interchain distance of TQ and PQ polymers were calculated and tabulated in Table 2. This ratio gives a qualitative picture of the polymer/molecular orientation33,34 of the π–π stacking with respect to the interchain direction. As shown, pPQ1F showed the highest ISD/IID, followed by pTQ1F, pTQ2F and pPQ2F. It seems that the conjugated side groups have an effect on either the preferential orientation of the polymer on the substrate or organization of the polymer chains.

OPV device characterization
The optimum device results, together with the J–V and IPCE curves of TQ and PQ polymers are shown in Table 3, Fig. 5 and 8, respectively. pBBTF exhibited poor solubility and due to the low LUMO which reduces efficiency of electron transfer to the acceptor, showed very poor device performance (Jsc = 0.08 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.42 V, FF = 0.25, PCE = 0.0086%). As noted above, pBBTF also may have a preference towards an edge-on orientation on substrates which is not favorable for vertical charge transport in OPV devices. On the other hand, the TQ polymers showed much better device performance. pTQ1F achieved a PCE of 1.05% at donor:acceptor (D:A) ratio of 1:4 while pTQ2F achieved a PCE of 0.51% at D:A ratio of 1:3. To the best of our knowledge, pTQ1F thus displays the highest PCE yet recorded for TQ based alternating copolymers in such standard device architectures without use of additives or of an electron transport/hole blocking layer.

AFM images showed smooth surfaces for thin films of all D/A ratios and annealing conditions for both TQ polymers, with pTQ1F showing nanofibre-like morphology (see Fig. 6) and pTQ2F showing fine morphology (see Fig. 7). pTQ1F showed higher Jsc, Voc and FF with respect to pTQ2F and these likely resulted from (1) higher mobility due to a shorter interchain distance, shorter π–π stacking distance and higher ratio of face-on configuration, (2) a better percolation pathway through a nanofibre-like morphology, (3) a higher energy offset to overcome the binding energy of the exciton due to the higher LUMO and (4) the deeper HOMO resulting in higher Voc. As the ratio of PC[71]BM increases, the nanofibre-like morphology disappears, replaced by the fine morphology. This suggests that the surface of the blend may have changed from pTQ1F rich to PC[71]BM rich, which results in better extraction of electrons and lower recombination as suggested by the increasing Jsc and FF. Besides, the higher PC[71]BM content also promotes more percolation pathways for electron transport. This results in a more balanced charge transport between holes and electrons, reducing series resistance of the device (or higher FF). However, the width of the nanofiber appeared to be around 100 nm, which is too large for the exciton to diffuse to the donor–acceptor interface, thus limiting the performance of pTQ1F. Proper morphological control of the nanofibre dimensions (to 10–20 nm) may improve exciton dissociation prior to recombination, generating more free-carriers; hence, better solar cell devices.

In the case of PQ polymers, there was a drastic contrast in the device performance between pPQ1F and pPQ2F (Table. 4). pPQ1F achieved a high PCE of 2.36% at D:A ratio of 1:3 with a high Jsc of 7.35 mA cm−2, a high Voc of 0.82 V and a low FF of 0.39 (Fig. 8). On the other hand, pPQ2F only managed to give a PCE of 0.038% with a very low Jsc, Voc and FF after optimization. Energetically speaking, pPQ2F has suitable HOMO and LUMO levels to be used as a donor material with PC[71]BM. The surprising device performance prompted a possible issue in the morphology of the active layer and/or active layer–electrode interface. However the AFM images show smooth surfaces for both PQ polymers, with pPQ1F showing very fine features (see Fig. 9) while pPQ2F showing very large features of more than 500 nm in the morphology (see Fig. 10). The fine features of pPQ1F help to maximize exciton dissociation via nanoscale phase separation between the donor and acceptor interface while the large features of pPQ2F do not. The shorter interchain distance, shorter π–π stacking distance and the higher ratio of face-on configuration for pPQ1F are likely to produce better charge transport which will further boast the efficiency of the device. Likewise, the edge-on configuration of pPQ2F may have contributed to the low Jsc. However, these do not fully explain the low Voc of pPQ2F devices.

It was reported that the kinetics of recombination at the D–A interfaces have a strong impact on the Voc.35 Materials with sterically inaccessible π-systems and non-planar geometries can kinetically suppress dark recombination processes, represented by the reverse saturation current density (J0).35–37 Under open circuit conditions, Voc is correlated with J0 from the following relationship:37  
Therefore, D–A systems with suppressed J0 tend to have a higher Voc. The dark J–V characteristics of pPQ1F:PC[71]BM (1:3) and pPQ2F:PC[71]BM (1:3) were exponentially fitted (Fig. 11) to extract J0 values of 3.6 × 10−9 mA cm−2 and 8.6 × 10−4 mA cm−2, respectively. The five orders of magnitude difference in J0 is represented as the remarkably lower Voc in pPQ2F:PC[71]BM devices. The shunt effect can also be excluded as both devices give comparable shunt resistance (Rsh) of 3.1 × 10−2 and 5.7 × 10−2 Ω cm2. This also suggests that the higher J0 indicates stronger interactions of the π-conjugated molecules in the pPQ2F:PC[71]BM blend.37 Comparison of bithienyl and biphenyl substituents reveals that the former is likely to allow darker recombination processes due to higher planarity with the core, and hence much lower Voc than expected in pPQ2F devices. This is also supported by the presence of large features in the pPQ2F:PC[71]BM blend surface, as planarity promotes molecular aggregation. Despite the lack of coplanarity of the substituents to the core in the pPQ1F system, no detrimental effects were observed on both exciton diffusion and charge transport processes, as evidenced from the higher Jsc and FF in pPQ1F:PC[71]BM devices. The same reasoning can be used to explain why pTQ2F (J0 = 9.4 × 10−5 mA cm−2) shows almost 0.1 V lower in Voc as compared to pTQ1F (J0 = 2.2 × 10−8 mA cm−2) when both of them have similar HOMO energy levels.

The solid lines are the exponential fits to the J–V characteristics at the intermediate voltages. The inset shows the same curves over a wider range of voltages. 
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the effects of aromatic substituents on the photophysical properties, morphology and OPV device performance of BBT, TQ and PQ polymers. The bithienyls in pTQ2F and pPQ2F offer a lower bandgap and broader light absorption via higher conjugation as compared to the biphenyls in pTQ1F and pPQ1F. Even though these properties are generally beneficial for device performance, they are at the expense of a higher HOMO and a larger dark current which result in a lower Voc, and lower LUMO which provides a lesser driving force to overcome exciton binding energy. The lower ratio of face-on configuration and the higher reverse saturation current in the former also appear to be more detrimental to the device performance in terms of the lower Jsc and Voc, respectively. These results provide some insight into polymeric materials with conjugated side chains for OPV applications and also help in the design of new materials with low bandgap and broad light absorption.
