Hierarchical 3D nanostructures exhibit 5.5 times higher photocatalytic activity than rod-like 1D nanostructures, and the DSSC efficiency of hierarchical 3D nanostructures becomes as high as 5.37%, which is 50% higher than the DSSC efficiency of 1D nanostructures. The high photocatalytic performances of the hierarchical 3D anatase TiO2 nanostructures have been attributed mainly to their large specific pore volume, whereas the high photovoltaic performances of hierarchical 3D nanostructures have been attributed not only to their high specific surface area and the large specific pore volume but also to their interparticular connectivity. Comparative experimental studies have shown that the as-prepared hierarchical mesoporous anatase TiO2 nanostructures show superior photocatalytic (three times higher) and photovoltaic performances (35% higher) to commercially available Degussa P25 TiO2.
1 Introduction
With the exponential growth of interest in the field of green energy and environmental sustainability, the conversion of solar energy into electrical or chemical energy has attracted great attention. A photocatalyst can absorb incoming light, generate excitons, and promote chemical reactions under soft conditions.1,2 Thus, it has been usefully applied for the photodegradation of organic pollutants,3,4 photoreduction of CO2 to produce hydrocarbon fuels,5 and solar water-splitting.6 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as promising alternatives to conventional silicon-based solar cells have also been studied in great detail because of their low production cost, facile fabrication processes, and stable photovoltaic properties.7–10
Metal oxide semiconductors have been considered to be representative materials for both photocatalysts and working electrodes for DSSCs.7,8 Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the most predominant oxide semiconductor reported in the scientific literature on photocatalytic and photovoltaic applications. In particular, anatase, which is one of the four polymorphs of TiO2, has been widely investigated due to its high photoreactivity, chemical stability, favorable band-edge positions, strong optical absorption, and low cost.11 There are several reported factors to be considered for the improvement of the photoactivity of anatase TiO2 crystals: crystalline facets, electronic band structures, shapes, sizes, porosities, and surface areas.11–13 Thus, extensive efforts have been made to improve the photoactivity of anatase TiO2 nanostructures by introducing the desired factors. In particular, the fabrication of anatase TiO2 crystals with tailored crystalline facets has been extensively investigated due to their intrinsic facet-dependent photoactivity; both theoretical and experimental studies on the low-index facets of anatase TiO2 crystals have reported that the {001} facets are much more reactive than the thermodynamically stable {101} facets.14–16 To fabricate highly efficient photoanodes for DSSCs, ideal TiO2 particles coated on the working electrode of DSSCs should have a large specific surface area for more dye loading, packed nanostructures for faster electron transfer, and an efficient light-scattering effect for better light harvesting. In addition, adequate porosity of TiO2 particles can facilitate the feasible transport of electrolytes.11,17 However, it is still a challenge to meet these criteria for working electrodes simultaneously in a single type of TiO2 nanostructures. Thus, hierarchical mesoporous anatase TiO2 3D nanostructures have drawn great attention due to their highly porous structures with high specific surface areas for the sake of the increased adsorption of guest molecules such as pollutants and dyes for DSSCs as well as their efficient light harvesting by excellent internal light-scattering effects.17–23 In spite of their novel structural advantages, there are only few reports on the photocatalytic and photovoltaic properties of hierarchical mesoporous TiO2 nanostructures because the controlled synthesis of hierarchical mesoporous TiO2 nanostructures remains a significant challenge. Furthermore, since Park et al. reported the shape-dependent thermodynamic parameters of hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanostructures,24 the photocatalytic and photovoltaic performances of hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures have hardly been compared with those of 1D TiO2 nanostructures.
Herein, we report the morphology-dependent photocatalytic and photovoltaic performances of anatase TiO2 nanostructures (Fig. 1). An eco-friendly two-step microwave-assisted synthetic method has been employed to control facilely the diverse morphologies of anatase TiO2 nanostructures ranging from rod-like 1D nanostructures to hedgehog-like 3D nanostructures. To investigate the structural effects on the photoactivity of hierarchical nanostructures, we have delicately tuned the aspect ratios of 1D building blocks in anatase TiO2 nanostructures. The aspect-ratio variation of 1D building blocks has led to changes in the surface areas and pore-volumes of hedgehog-like 3D nanostructures notably. From detailed surface characterization, it has been found that whereas as-prepared rod-like 1D nanostructures consist of single crystalline anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with dominantly exposed {101} facets, hedgehog-like 3D nanostructures consist of anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with exposed {001} and {101} facets. The photoactivity experiments have shown that whereas the photocatalytic performances increase mainly with the increase of the specific pore volume, the photovoltaic performances increase with the combination of the high surface area, the large pore volume, and the strong interparticular connectivity. Hedgehog-like 3D nanostructures display 5.5 times higher photocatalytic activity than rod-like 1D nanostructures. When they are employed in the working electrode of DSSCs, the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of DSSCs becomes as high as 5.37%, which is 50% higher than the DSSC efficiency of rod-like 1D nanostructures. In addition, the as-prepared anatase TiO2 nanostructures show superior photocatalytic and photovoltaic activities compared with commercially available Degussa P25 TiO2.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials and preparation

2.1.1 Materials. 
Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TIP, l, >97%), glycerol (l, >99%), isopropanol (l, >99.9%), and ethanol (l, >99%) were used as purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ultrapure deionized water (>17 MΩ cm) from a Millipore Milli-Q system was used throughout the experiments.


2.1.2 Preparation. 
Titanium glycerolate crystals were first synthesized as the precursors of anatase TiO2 nanostructures according to the reported procedure with modification.25,26 2.0 mmol of titanium isopropoxide was added to 40 mL of a solvent mixture of isopropanol and glycerol with a certain volume fraction of isopropanol (R). The mixture was maintained at 40 °C under vigorous stirring for 5 min and sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min to make the solution homogeneously clear. The clear solution was transferred into a 300 mL reactor and irradiated using a Samsung HV-367AWJ microwave system (2.45 GHz, 450 W) for 10 min. The white precipitate was harvested by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and water three times, and dried at 40 °C. In order to prepare anatase TiO2 nanostructures, 100 mg of the titanium glycerolate precursor was dispersed in 30 mL of water and subjected to microwave irradiation for 10 min. The white precipitate was centrifuged, washed with ethanol and water three times, and dried at 40 °C. Anatase TiO2 crystals obtained through the hydrolysis of titanium glycerolate precursors prepared at R values of 0.00, 0.08, 0.20, 0.40, 0.67, and 0.85 will be designated as A00, A08, A20, A40, A67, and A85, respectively.

2.2 Characterization and evaluation

2.2.1 General. 
While scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were captured with a JEOL JSM-6700F microscope, Fourier transform (FFT) patterns and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-3000F microscope. High-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) patterns were recorded using a Bruker D8 DISCOVER diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.154178 nm), valence-band X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected using a Thermo Scientific Sigma Probe ESCA spectrometer (Al Kα X-ray source), and N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were carried out using a Quantachrome Autosorb AUTOSORB-IQ-MP gas-sorption system.


2.2.2 Photocatalytic oxidation activity. 
Photocatalytic oxidation efficiencies were estimated by monitoring the amount of CO2 evolved during the decomposition of isopropanol in the gas phase. An aqueous suspension containing 2.0 mg of the photocatalyst was spread on a 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 glass as a film and dried at room temperature. The net volume of the gas-tight reactor was 200 mL, and the photocatalyst-coated film was placed at the center of the reactor. The entire area of the photocatalytic film was irradiated using a 300 W Xe lamp with a water filter to cut off IR radiation. After the reactor was evacuated, it was injected with 32 μL of 1:9 (v/v) isopropanol and water. The initial concentration of gaseous isopropanol in the reactor was maintained at 117 ppm in volume (ppmv). Thus, the ultimate concentration of CO2 evolved after the complete oxidation of the injected isopropanol will be 351 ppmv, as shown in the following equation: 2(CH3)2CHOH (g) + 9O2 (g) → 6CO2 (g) + 8H2O (g). The total pressure of the reactor was then adjusted to 750 mm Hg by adding O2 (g). Under this condition, the injected isopropanol and water remained in the vapor phase. After a certain irradiation interval, 0.5 mL of the gas in the reactor was automatically directed to an Agilent Technologies 6890N gas chromatograph (GC) using an auto-sampling valve system. For CO2 detection, a methanizer was installed between a GC column outlet and a flame ionization detector (FID).


2.2.3 Photocatalytic reduction activity. 
Photocatalytic CO2-reduction efficiencies were evaluated by monitoring CH3OH evolved in a home-made gas-tight reactor, as described in Fig. S1.† An aqueous suspension containing 32.0 mg of a photocatalyst was spread on a 5 × 5 cm2 soda-lime glass in the form of a film and dried at 50 °C for 2 h. The photocatalyst-coated film was placed in the center of the reactor, and its whole area was irradiated through a quartz window. Before measuring the photocatalytic activity, the film was irradiated using a bare 300 W Xe lamp for 30 min to remove organic impurities on the catalytic surface. After the 400 mL gas-tight reactor was evacuated, it was filled with water-saturated CO2 (g). The IR-filtered light of a 300 W Xe lamp through a water filter was used as the UV-visible light source. The gas mixture in the reactor was magnetically convected during irradiation. After irradiation for 30 min, 0.5 mL of the gas sample in the reactor was automatically directed to an Agilent Technologies 7890N GC using an auto-sampling valve system. In order to minimize the re-decomposition of the evolved products, the measurement cycle (chamber evacuation → wet CO2 gas filling → light irradiation → product detection) was repeated every 30 min and the amounts of evolved gases in each cycle were summed up. While the evolved CH3OH was detected using an FID detector with an Agilent Technologies DB-1 column, the evolved amounts of CO2, CO, and O2 were detected using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with a Supelco Carboxen-1010 column.


2.2.4 Photovoltaic activity. 
For the preparation of the working electrode for DSSCs, a viscous paste was prepared by the following procedure. 0.4 g of ethyl cellulose, 0.05 g of lauric acid, and 4.5 g of terpineol were added to the ethanol suspension of the as-prepared TiO2 powder and then ethanol was removed from the solution by a rotary evaporator to obtain a viscous paste. The prepared TiO2 paste was then coated on a bare FTO layer via a doctor-blade method. The coated films were baked at 150 °C for 30 min and subsequently calcined at 500 °C for 15 min. For dye adsorption, the fabricated TiO2 films were immersed in anhydrous ethanol containing N719 dye and kept for 24 h at room temperature. Pt-coated FTO, used as a counter electrode, was prepared by adding dropwise a 0.7 mM H2PtCl6 solution on an FTO glass, followed by heating at 400 °C for 20 min in air. The electrolyte consisted of 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.02 M LiI, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile and valeronitrile 85:15 (v/v). The active area of the dye-coated TiO2 film was 0.420 cm2. Photocurrent–voltage (I–V) measurements were performed using a Keithley model 2400 source measurement unit. A 300 W Xe lamp was used as the light source, and the light intensity was adjusted approximately to AM 1.5G one sun-light illumination using an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with a KG-5 filter.

3 Results and discussion
The SEM images of Fig. 2a, b and S2† show that the morphologies of anatase TiO2 structures can be controlled successfully from rod-like 1D structures to various hedgehog-like hierarchical 3D structures consisting of 1D building blocks with different aspect ratios via a two-step microwave-assisted synthetic process. All the HRXRD patterns of our as-prepared anatase TiO2 crystals have been found to match well with the reference pattern of the anatase TiO2 structure (Fig. S3†). Considering that the peaks of titanium glycerolate crystals are not observed at all in the HRXRD patterns of our as-prepared anatase TiO2 nanostructures, we suggest that microwave-assisted hydrolysis has completely transformed titanium glycerolate precursors into anatase TiO2 crystals. It has also been shown in the SEM images of Fig. 2a, b and S2† that all the hierarchical anatase TiO2 structures are the assembly of numerous nanosized 1D building blocks, whose average aspect ratios increase with increase of the R value (Table 1).

To identify the structural details of nanosized building blocks of anatase TiO2, HRTEM images have been recorded (Fig. 2c and d). Interestingly, HRTEM images have shown that the building blocks of anatase TiO2 nanostructures consist of small interconnected TiO2 nanocrystals that result from the hydrolysis of titanium glycerolate precursors. Thus, the as-prepared anatase TiO2 nanostructures have high surface roughness to bring about large specific surface areas and high porosities. Fig. S4† confirms that the as-prepared anatase TiO2 nanostructures are constructed by closely interconnected nanocrystals, showing the possibility of having good interparticular connectivity, and that the interparticle voids form multiple pores, generating high internal surface areas to adsorb guest molecules.
HRTEM images (Fig. 2c and d) and FFT patterns (Fig. 2e) indicate that the surface conditions of hedgehog-like 3D anatase TiO2 nanostructures are significantly different from those of rod-like 1D anatase TiO2 nanocrystals; although the 1D nanocrystals have thermodynamically stable {101} facets dominantly, the 3D nanostructures have reactive {001} facets as well as {101} facets. Both the HRTEM image and the FFT pattern of A00 display a single d-spacing of 0.35 nm that agrees well with the standard spacing of 0.352 nm between the (101) lattice planes of the anatase TiO2 crystal lattice (JPCDS card no. 841286). This indicates that all the anatase TiO2 crystals of A00 are dominated by {101} facets and that their individual nanocrystals are excellently aligned along the [100] direction.19 However, each of A20 and A67 reveals interplanar spacings of 0.48 and 0.35 nm together, which are in good accordance with the respective standard spacings of 0.476 and 0.352 nm between the (002) and the (101) planes of the anatase TiO2 structure. Moreover, the FFT patterns of A20 and A67 show that the angle between the (101) and the (10) planes and the angle between the (101) and the (002) planes are 44° and 68°, respectively, which are also in agreement with the respective theoretical angles of 44.5° and 68.3°.11,26,27 It has been reported that the order of the average surface energies is {001} (0.90 J m−2) > {010} (0.53 J m−2) > {101} (0.44 J m−2).15,16 The existence of highly reactive {001} facets in the 3D anatase TiO2 nanostructures is considered to arise from the temperature-dependent kinetic growth of titanium glycerolate precursors; because our anatase TiO2 nanocrystals have been produced by the simple hydrolysis of the titanium glycerolate precursors, the surface properties of anatase TiO2 have been inherited from the titanium glycerolate precursors. Whereas 1D precursors have been grown under thermodynamic conditions (at high growth temperatures), the 3D precursors have been fabricated under kinetic conditions (at low growth temperatures). Thus, 1D anatase TiO2 nanostructures have thermodynamically stable {101} facets mainly, and 3D anatase TiO2 nanostructures have reactive {002} and {004} facets as well as {101} facets. It was not possible to calculate the accurate fractions of the respective exposed facets in individual anatase TiO2 nanostructures due to their irregular shapes.
In general, because the photocatalysis and electron transfer of DSSCs are surface-based processes, it is important to investigate surface conditions of the fabricated crystals. Thus, we have measured the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the as-prepared TiO2 nanostructures (Fig. 3). It can be seen that all our samples show type-IV isotherms with type-H3 hysteresis loops according to the IUPAC classification, indicating that our samples have mesoporous structures.29–31Table 1 shows that all the 3D hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanostructures have higher values of specific surface areas than the 1D anatase TiO2 nanostructures. The specific pore volumes and the pore sizes as well as the specific surface areas of 3D nanostructures depend strongly on the aspect ratios of their building blocks. As the average aspect ratio of the building blocks of 3D nanostructures increases, the hysteresis loop shifts toward a lower relative pressure and the area of the hysteresis loop increases, indicating that the specific surface area increases with increase of the R value. Also, the peak of pore-size distribution shifts toward a smaller pore diameter and the area of the distribution increases with the increase of the aspect ratio, indicating that the pore size decreases while the pore volume increases with increase of the R value. The fact that the pore volume of 3D nanostructures is larger than that of 1D nanostructures can be attributed to the nature of hierarchical structures.32 Taking all the above facts into consideration, we assert that our microwave-assisted fabrication method can successfully control the morphologies as well as the surface conditions of anatase TiO2 nanostructures.

Anatase TiO2 crystals exposed with dissimilar crystal facets are known to exhibit different electronic band structures because each facet has its own unique surface atomic arrangement.15,16,33 Because the electronic band structure is considered to be a very important factor that affects the photoreactivity of anatase TiO2 crystals, we have deduced the electronic-band gap alignments of the as-prepared anatase TiO2 crystals by combining UV-visible diffuse-reflectance spectra and valence-band XPS spectra (Fig. 4). The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra in Fig. 4a show that the absorption edges of A20 and A67 are red-shifted by 6 nm with respect to that of A00. It is well known that anatase TiO2 is an indirect semiconductor, whose bandgap can be estimated by extrapolating the linear portion of the modified Kubelka–Munk function versus the energy of light (Fig. 4b). The derived band gaps of A00, A20, and A67 are 3.10, 3.07, and 3.07 eV, respectively. On the other hand, the valence-band XPS spectra in Fig. 4c reveal that all our anatase TiO2 crystals have the valence-band maxima at the same value of 1.97 eV. Thus, the conduction-band minimum of A00 is raised by 0.03 with respect to those of A20 and A67; the order of the potential of the conduction-band potential minima is A00 > A20 = A67 (Fig. 4d). It is reported that whereas the energy of the {001} surface is higher than that of the {101} surface, the conduction-band minimum of the {001} surface is lower than that of the {101} surface.33

The photocatalytic oxidation activity of the as-synthesized anatase TiO2 nanostructures was evaluated by oxidizing gaseous isopropanol under UV-visible irradiation (Fig. 5). Gaseous isopropanol is initially oxidized to generate acetone as an intermediate, and is ultimately converted into carbon dioxide and water.34,35 Thus, the amounts of remnant isopropanol, evolved acetone, and evolved CO2 have been monitored as a function of irradiation time to determine the photoactivity of each sample of anatase TiO2 nanostructures. As shown in Fig. 5, the photocatalytic activities of hedgehog-like 3D nanostructures are much more efficient than that of rod-like 1D nanostructures. It can be also observed that the photocatalytic activity of 3D TiO2 nanostructures increases gradually as the average aspect ratio of building blocks increases. As the average aspect ratio of building blocks increases, both the specific surface area and the specific pore volume, as well as the exposure of the reactive {001} facets, increase. However, a close examination of Tables 1 and S1† reveals that the photocatalytic oxidation activity of TiO2 nanostructures depends particularly on the specific pore volume of TiO2 nanostructures. This suggests that the heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation of gaseous isopropanol takes place inside the nanopores of anatase TiO2 nanostructures. Mahmoud et al. have reported the nanoreactor confinement effect that catalytic reactions occurring on the external surface of a solid nanoparticle are in contrast with those occurring in the nanocavity of a nanostructure, which reduces the activation energy extensively.3,36 Thus, we consider that the morphology of hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanostructures having a large specific pore volume is responsible for their efficient photocatalytic oxidation performances.

The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O has been well known to produce CH4 and CH3OH as the main products.37,38 Thus, the amount of evolved CH3OH, which was selectively produced in our photoreactor, was monitored to evaluate the structural advantage of our photocatalyst under UV-visible irradiation. Fig. 6 and Table S1† show that the evolved amount of CH3OH via anatase TiO2 A67 is 3.1 times higher than that via the commercial photocatalyst Degussa P25 TiO2. Because Degussa P25 is known to have a specific surface area of 51.4 m2 g−1 and a specific pore volume of 0.17 m3 g−1,28,39 it is suggested that the enhancement of the photocatalytic reduction activity of anatase TiO2 A67 also arises from the increase of the specific pore volume of anatase TiO2 A67. Thus, we assert that the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, as well as the photocatalytic oxidation of isopropanol, via TiO2 nanostructures occurs inside their nanocavities. The very efficient photocatalytic oxidation and reduction performances of our hierarchical mesoporous anatase TiO2 nanostructures are considered to result from their extremely large specific pore volumes.

To evaluate the photovoltaic performances of the as-synthesized TiO2 nanostructures, our samples have been applied as working electrodes having a film thickness of 10 μm for DSSCs. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves shown in Fig. 7 and the photovoltaic operation parameters shown in Tables 2 and S2† indicate that our as-prepared TiO2 nanostructures perform well as the working electrode of DSSCs with and without a light-shading mask. The photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs in Tables 2 and S2† reveal that the power conversion efficiency (η) of anatase TiO2 nanostructures increases gradually as the R value increases; the largest power conversion efficiency has been observed with anatase TiO2 A67, which has the largest specific surface area and the highest specific pore volume among our as-prepared anatase TiO2 crystals. It is well known that mesoporous anatase TiO2 structures can facilitate the transport of electrons and the diffusion of the redox couple of electrolytes.17–20 Therefore, the highest DSSC efficiency of A67 can be explained by two factors. First, the increased light-harvesting efficiency can be enhanced by the intense dye adsorption and internal light-scattering effect owing to the greatest specific surface area as well as the largest specific pore volume. Second, the rapid charge transport through the photoanode film made of mesoporous TiO2 nanostructures owing to the better interparticular connectivity can also improve the DSSC efficiency of A67 substantially.18,39 For these reasons, the DSSC efficiency of anatase TiO2 nanostructures A67 is 35% higher than that of commercially available TiO2 Degussa P25 (Table 2).

The photocatalytic and photovoltaic performances of our anatase TiO2 nanostructures have been illustrated in Fig. S6.† Although both performances depend on the morphology and the surface conditions of TiO2 crystals, their dependent behaviors are quite different from each other. As described previously, whereas the photocatalytic performances increase mostly depending on the increase of the specific pore volume, the photovoltaic performances increase not only with the specific surface area and the specific pore volume, which enhance the light-harvesting ability, but also with the interparticular connectivity, which improves the charge transport. Overall, it has been shown that the morphology as well as the surface conditions of our hierarchical mesoporous anatase TiO2 nanostructures is highly beneficial to achieve efficient photocatalytic and photovoltaic performances. During the review process of this manuscript, a reviewer suggested to check whether film qualities affected the photocatalytic activities of TiO2 nanostructures or not. Fig. S7† shows that the films of 3D hierarchical nanostructures have more interparticle stacking faults compared with the film of 1D nanostructures; whereas rod-like TiO2 nanostructures form a flat film, hedgehog-like TiO2 nanostructures cannot form flat films homogeneously due to their interparticle steric hindrance. Thus, we consider that the higher photocatalytic activities of 3D hierarchical nanostructures are not due to their better film qualities.
4 Conclusions
Mesoporous anatase TiO2 nanostructures with diverse morphologies ranging from rod-like 1D nanostructures to hedgehog-like 3D hierarchical nanostructures have been prepared to investigate their photocatalytic and photovoltaic performances. Hierarchical 3D nanostructures exhibit 5.5 times higher photocatalytic activity than rod-like 1D nanostructures, and the DSSC efficiency of hierarchical 3D nanostructures becomes as high as 5.37%, which is 50% higher than the DSSC efficiency of 1D nanostructures. The high photocatalytic performances of the hierarchical 3D anatase TiO2 nanostructures are attributed mainly to their large specific pore volume because mesoporous nanocavities can decrease the activation energy of photocatalytic reactions. On the other hand, the high photovoltaic performances of hierarchical 3D nanostructures have been attributed not only to their large specific surface area and the large specific pore volume, which enhance the light-harvesting ability by increasing dye adsorption and the internal light-scattering effect, but also to the interparticular connectivity, which improves the charge transport within working electrodes for DSSCs. Comparative experimental studies have shown that the as-prepared hierarchical mesoporous anatase TiO2 nanostructures have superior photocatalytic (three times higher) and photovoltaic performances (35% higher) to those of commercially available Degussa P25 TiO2. Thus, our results are suggested to contribute considerably to the development of new strategies for the improvement of the photocatalytic and photovoltaic performances of anatase TiO2 nanostructures.
