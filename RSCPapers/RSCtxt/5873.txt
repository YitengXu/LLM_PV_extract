    , Accepted 9th July 2015First published on 10th July 2015AbstractA new method for the reduction of CO2 to CH3OH coupled with selective alcohol oxidation using a photocatalytic method has been developed in the present paper. CO2 as the oxidant was reduced to methanol by photo-induced electrons, and aromatic alcohols were used as the reductants to react with photo-generated holes and were converted to aromatic aldehydes with high selectivity. The maximum conversion of aromatic alcohol to aldehyde was 91.7% with a selectivity of 98%, and the highest yield of methanol was 358.7 μmol g−1. This study could provide a valuable method not only for carbon dioxide conversion into fuel which could remission energy shortages, but also for the selective oxidation of alcohols to produce aldehydes.
1. Introduction
The photocatalytic conversion of solar energy into nonpolluting and usable chemical energy is always of great interest. Since Fujishima and Honda et al. discovered the production of hydrogen and oxygen through photocatalytic water splitting in 1972,1 photocatalysis has been investigated in various systems. Especially, Inoue et al. demonstrated the photocatalytic synthesis of formic acid, formaldehyde, methyl alcohol and methane from carbon dioxide over photosensitive semiconductor powder catalysts in water medium.2 Subsequently, many research efforts have been made to address the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into small organic molecules has also become a great intention in recent years.3–5
Being a cheap, stable, nontoxic, and environmentally friendly material, titania (TiO2) is an idea semiconductor photocatalyst. As a versatile material, TiO2 is extensively applied in various photocatalytic reactions. In the particular case of CO2 photoreduction, one of the efficient photocatalysts is metal-doped titania.6–9 Copper doping is the most efficient way to enhance selectivity towards CH3OH production and the formation of formic acid derivatives in the photoreduction of CO2 (ref. 10). Silver doped crystalline titania (Ag–TiO2) prepared by the sol–gel method has been reported recently for CO2 reduction to CH4 and CH3OH as the main products in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in water.11
In fact, the majority of these studies in the literature are carried out in liquid H2O as the reaction medium in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.6–11 It could be interesting to check other solvents that are more difficult to reduce than H2O.12 In addition, alcohols also allow the presence of Brønsted acids, which could favour the thermodynamics of the reduction. It is possible that the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 coupled with selective alcohol oxidation in organic solvent would be more efficient than in water. Actually, only a few groups13 have studied this kind of photocatalytic reaction in organic media.
The selective oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding aldehydes, in particular the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde,14,15 is one of the most popular organic transformations and is of fundamental importance in laboratory and commercial processes. Aromatic aldehydes are widely used in fragrances, flavorings, pharmaceutical industries, plastic additives, and are also highly valuable to the perfume industry. Heterogeneous photocatalysis has also been used for achieving selective alcohol oxidation. A number of studies have been reported on the selective catalytic oxidation of alcohols into aldehydes under O2 using a series of photocatalysts.16–19 Moreover, a facile preparation method using inexpensive transition metals with a more selective and environmentally friendly system for the catalytic oxidation of aromatic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes is certainly in greater demand.
The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into small organic molecules, coupled with selective alcohol oxidation to aldehydes in organic solvent, has a certain practical value and application prospects, and is challenging. This reaction is not only able to convert carbon dioxide into fuel, but is also able to convert alcohols to aldehydes with high selectivity. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into small organic molecules coupled with alcohol selective oxidation to aldehydes. In this paper, a series of inexpensive and facilely prepared photocatalysts, Ag/TiO2 nanocomposites, were fabricated using a conventional sol–gel method together with photoassisted methods. These kinds of catalysts were used to explore the photocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction coupled with aromatic alcohol oxidation in organic solvent.
2. Experimental
2.1 The preparation of titanium dioxide nanoparticles
TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared using a modified sol–gel method. In a typical synthesis procedure, a volume of 20 ml of tetrabutyl titanate was dissolved in 80 ml of anhydrous diethyl ether at room temperature, and then 24 ml of acetic acid was added. After stirring this solution for 30 min, 30 ml of a mixture solution of double deionized water and acetic acid with a ratio of 2:1 (by volume) was added dropwise to the precursor solution under vigorous stirring. Following this, a large amount of white precipitate was formed in the solution. Subsequently the mixture was kept stirring for 2 hours. The suspension was aged under airtight conditions at room temperature for 24 hours. After suction filtration, the xerogel was washed several times with deionized water to remove the residual acid, and then dried at 100 °C for one day. Finally, the samples were divided into several sections and calcined at 400–800 °C for 2 hours in a muffle furnace at a 5 °C per minute heating rate from room to setting temperature. Then, the sample was ground into a power in an agate mortar.
2.2 Synthesis of Ag/TiO2 composites
Ag/TiO2 nanoparticles were produced by a photodeposition method. By using the above synthetic TiO2 nanoparticles as the catalyst support, 1 g of TiO2 was dispersed in an oxalic acid aqueous solution and sonicated for 15 min, then a predetermined amount of AgNO3 was added to the solution and stirred for 2 hours to form a homogeneous solution. Then this solution was irradiated on an ultraviolet lamp (PHILIPS TUV 25 W G2578 bactericidal lamp) for 4 hours under stirring at 500 rpm at room temperature. When its colour changed from white to reddish brown, the suspension was centrifuged at 10000 rpm and washed several times with deionized water. The xerogel was transferred to an electronic vacuum oven and dried overnight at 60 °C.
2.3 Catalyst characterization
XRD measurements were performed on a D8 diffractometer from Bruker instruments (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.15406 nm) operated at 40 kV and 25 mA. The diffractograms were collected in the 2θ range from 20 to 80° in steps of 0.02° per min with a count time of 20 s at each point. The crystalline phase can be determined from the integration intensities of the anatase and rutile phases corresponding to (101), (110) and (120), respectively. The average crystalline sizes were determined according to the Debye–Scherrer equation using the full width half maximum data of each phase. The nanoparticle average crystalline size of TiO2 was determined according to the 2θ = 25.3° (101) face. The SEM morphological analysis of the samples was carried out using a scanning electron microscope (Quanta 200 F FEI). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a JEM 2100 F transmission electron microscope equipped with EDX at an operating voltage of 200 kV. The TEM samples were prepared by sonication of the powders in absolute alcohol for 15 minutes and subsequently dispersed on carbon coated copper grids dried at room temperature. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DSR) were recorded using a SHIMADU UV-2550 UV-vis spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere attachment for the diffuse reflectance in the range of 300–800 nm and using BaSO4 powder as the reference. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum was recorded using a Perkin-Elmer LS55 fluorescence spectrometer at room temperature. The nanocomposites were dispersed in carbon tetrachloride and excited using D light at a wavelength of 265 nm.
2.4 Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 coupled with selective aromatic alcohol oxidation activity test
The photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with aromatic alcohol oxidation reactions were carried out in a 70 ml homemade double-jacket quartz glass reactor. 0.5 g of catalyst was added to the photo-reactor, and 30 ml of anhydrous acetonitrile (purified by calcium hydroxide and distilled before using) and 1 mmol of aromatic alcohol (purified by distillation before using) was subsequently put into the reactor. After that, the reaction cell was evacuated to a base pressure of 10 kPa for 15 minutes to remove residual oxygen, and afterwards high-purity CO2 was filled into the reactor for 30 minutes at a flow rate of 15 ml per minute. To ensure the full removal of trace amounts of oxygen, this operation was repeated three times. In order to remove trace amounts of H2O and oxygen in the gas, the CO2 gas was purified through allochroic silica gel, asbestos and activated carbon before importing into the reactor. Then, a balloon was connected to the reactor keeping the reaction under 0.1 MPa pressure. Before irradiation the suspension was kept stirring at 500 rpm for 60 minutes to ensure a CO2 adsorption and desorption equilibrium. The ultraviolet (UV) light (high pressure mercury lamp main wavelength is 365 nm) was irradiated from the box wall 10 cm in front of the reactor. The liquid products were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) with a flame ionization detector (FID). In order to analyse the gas products qualitatively, the gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) (7890A-5975C Agilent Corporation equipped with a HP-5 capillary column (Hewllett-Packard, USA, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm)) was also used to identify the components of the product. The liquid products were also characterized using a Bruker Avance 400 MHz spectrometer (NMR).
3. Results and discussion
The experimental details and characterization data of the catalysts are given in the experimental section and supporting information.†Fig. 1 and S1† present the microscopy images of the TiO2 and Ag/TiO2 nanocomposites. From these representative morphologies, it can be clearly seen that the TiO2 crystallite is well formed and its surface is smooth. Moreover, the SEM and TEM images in Fig. 1 show silver nanoparticles anchored on the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles. The silver nanoparticles are homogeneously dispersed on the surface of TiO2, forming a series of Ag/TiO2 nanocomposites.
 Fig. 1  (a) SEM and (b) TEM images of ca. 3 wt% Ag/TiO2 nanoparticles. (c and d) HR-TEM images of ca. 3 wt% Ag/TiO2 nanoparticles. 
To obtain more information on the catalysts, HR-TEM was used to observe these nanoparticles. Typical TEM micrographs of the TiO2 and Ag/TiO2 nanoparticle catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. From Fig. 1b, the relatively dark points are ascribed to Ag nanoparticles. The silver nanoparticle morphology is irregular spherical particles that have a narrow size distribution, while the transparent regions are assigned to TiO2 in Fig. 1b. Meanwhile, it was evident that the average particle size of the nanoparticles was 40–50 nm, which was in good agreement with the XRD results calculated from the Debye–Scherrer equation (Fig. S2†). HR-TEM was used to investigate the interfacial structures between Ag and TiO2 (Fig. 1c and d). In Fig. 1c and d, the lattice fringes of Ag and TiO2 showed a surface-junction. The (111) lattice fringe of the Ag nanoparticles was 0.236 nm, and the (101) lattice fringe of anatase was 0.356 nm. These results are in agreement with the previous reports.20–22
The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 coupled with selective benzyl alcohol oxidation was carried out under ultraviolet light irradiation at 0.1 MPa CO2 pressure. The main liquid products were determined using GC (FID detector) (Fig. S3†). This result was also proved by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2). When the reaction was carried out in CO2, the CO2 was reduced to methanol, and benzaldehyde was the main product of the photocatalytic selective benzyl alcohol oxidation, along with traces of benzoic acid and benzyl ether (Table 1). The highest conversion of benzyl alcohol is 10.3% and 10.7%, and the maximum yield of methanol is 21.8 and 20.5 μmol g−1 catalyzed by TiO2 and ca. 1 wt% Ag/TiO2 after reacting for 18 hours, respectively. However, when reacting in an Ar gas atmosphere, the highest conversion of benzyl alcohol is only 1.7% and 1.9%, and there is no methanol or other products to be observed when catalyzed by TiO2 and ca. 3 wt% Ag/TiO2 catalysts, respectively. The blind test without catalyst (please see Table 1, entry 19) shows that the conversion of benzyl alcohol is very low (0.75%) and that there is no methanol to be observed. These results verified that CO2 is able to be reduced to methanol coupled with the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, and that methanol is only produced from CO2, catalyzed by both TiO2 and Ag/TiO2.

The effects of the silver loading content on TiO2 on the catalytic activity were evaluated as well. Compared to pure TiO2, the photocatalytic activity of the ca. 2–6 wt% Ag/TiO2 nanocomposites exhibited a significant increase (Table 1). Meanwhile, the conversion of benzyl alcohol and the yield of the methanol are both drastically increased when catalyzed by ca. 2–6 wt% Ag/TiO2. It was found that ca. 3 wt% Ag/TiO2 was optimum to achieve the highest conversion of benzyl alcohol (24.6%) and the maximum yield of methanol (40.9 μmol g−1) after reacting for 18 hours. When the silver loading content is less than 3 wt%, the photocatalytic efficiency of the catalyst is increased with silver loading content. This could be because the Ag nanoparticles deposited on the surface of TiO2 can act as photo-induced carrier separation centers.23 Moreover, a Schottky barrier was formed between the silver and TiO2 contact region, which improved the charge separation and enhanced the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 (ref. 24).
However, when the silver loading exceeds 3 wt%, the photocatalytic activity rapidly decreases. The conversion of benzyl alcohol and the yield of methanol are decreased from 24.6% to 14.9% and from 40.9 to 14.9 μmol g−1 with the increasing of silver loading content from 3% to 9%, respectively. This is may be because excess silver nanoparticles cover the surface of the TiO2 activity sites that can absorb UV photons. Therefore, the absorption photon capacity of the catalyst is reduced. The excess silver nanoparticles can also act as recombination centers of electrons and holes, which also results in a decrease of the photocatalytic activity of the Ag/TiO2 nanocomposites. In fact, it has been reported that the probability for hole capture increases with the large number of negatively charged silver particles on the surface of TiO2 at high silver loading, which also increases the photo-induced electron and hole recombinations.25 These results are in good agreement with the photoluminescence (PL) spectra intensity of the photocatalysts shown in Fig. S4.† From Fig. S4,† the PL intensities are decreased with an increase of the Ag loading content when the Ag loading content is less than 3 wt%. When the PL signal intensity is weaker, the photocatalytic efficiency is higher. However, when the Ag loading content exceeds ca. 4 wt%, the PL intensities increase. It is indicated that excess silver deposited on the surface of TiO2 can act as electron sinks to capture the photo-induced electron and hole pairs.
Furthermore, the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methanol coupled with the selective oxidation of various alcohols has been performed over 3 wt% Ag/TiO2 under the same reaction conditions. The results are shown in Table 2. It is indicated that all of the catalyzing systems investigated were capable of converting CO2 to methanol and converting the aromatic alcohols to corresponding aldehydes with different yield. The groups on the aromatic ring have an effect on the reaction performance. The electron donating groups on the aromatic ring favor methanol production and alcohol oxidation. For example, methoxybenzyl alcohol can convert to p-anisaldehyde with conversions of 50.3% and 91.7%, and the yield of CH3OH is 40.9 and 309.6 μmol g−1 after reacting for 18 and 48 hours, respectively. However, the electron withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring result in a low conversion. The conversion of p-nitrobenzaldehyde to nitrobenzyl alcohol is only 8.4% and 19.8% after reacting for 18 and 48 hours, respectively. The yield of CH3OH is low as well (13.6 and 79.5 μmol g−1) under the same reaction conditions.

In order to know the stoichiometry of this reaction, the ratio of the formation of methanol and aldehyde has been calculated (the last column in Table 2). The result shows that the ratio will be increased with prolongation of the reaction time. This can be explained by some intermediates that are formed (such as HCOOH, HCHO) in the initial phase. At 48 hours, the highest ratio is 1:4 which is still smaller than the reaction stoichiometry (1:3). The first reason is that side-products are formed, such as H2, CH4, HCOOH, HCHO etc. The second reason is that with the progression of the reaction, the methanol also reacts with photo-generated holes to produce H2 and CO2. With the increasing concentration of methanol, this reaction becomes faster and faster. When the formation rate of methanol is close to its decomposition rate, the production of methanol levels off.
The effect of irradiation time on the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 and benzyl alcohol conversion was investigated over a period of 1–48 hours for the ca. 3 wt% Ag/TiO2 nanocomposite catalyst (Fig. 3). With the increase of irradiation time, the conversion is clearly increased. However, the selectivity is slightly decreased due to by-products emerging in the reaction system. The methanol yield is increased with the extension of irradiation time (Fig. 3b). When the photoirradiation time is less than 18 hours, the increase in yield is low. But when the photoirradiation time is longer than 18 hours, the yield is obviously improving. After the photoirradiation time reaches 45 hours, the yield of methanol is 344.6 μmol g−1 (Fig. 3b), and the conversion of benzyl alcohol is 70.6% with a 98% selectivity for benzaldehyde.

In order to test the stability of the Ag/TiO2 nanoparticle catalyst, the used catalysts were recovered by centrifugation and thoroughly washed with anhydrous acetonitrile. The photocatalyst was recycled up to three times. As shown in Fig. 4, its photocatalytic activity was only slightly deteriorated after three consecutive photocatalytic experiments. This can be ascribed to only a few silver nanoparticles leaching and aggregating after the test, leading to the photocatalytic efficiency only weakly decreasing after three run times. These results showed that the photocatalyst was stable after repeated application with a constant conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde.

To understand the reaction mechanism of CO2 reduction to methanol coupled with alcohol oxidation, the proposed mechanism for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methanol coupled with alcohol oxidation is as follows: Catalyst + hv → catalyst* + e−cond + p+val(1) PhCH2OH(aq) + 2p+val → PhCHO + 2H+cond(2) CO2 + 2H+cond + 2e−cond → HCOOH(3) HCOOH + 2H+cond + 2e−cond → HCHO + H2O(4) HCHO + 2H+cond + 2e−cond → CH3OH(5)
Photogenerated holes in the VB of the semiconductor oxidize alcohol to aldehyde and release H+ (eqn (2)), and photogenerated electrons in the CB reduce carbon dioxide by a sequence of reactions to produce HCOOH, HCHO and CH3OH (eqn (3), (2) and (5)).
4. Conclusions
The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 coupled with selective alcohol oxidation was catalyzed by Ag/TiO2 nanocomposites under UV light irradiation at room temperature and ambient pressure. CO2 as the oxidant was reduced to methanol by photo-induced electrons. Aromatic alcohols were used as the reductant to react with photo-generated holes, and converted to aromatic aldehydes with high selectivity. The optimal catalyst was ca. 3 wt% Ag/TiO2 nanoparticles. The maximum conversion of aromatic alcohol to aldehyde was 91.7% with a selectivity of 98%, and the highest yield of methanol was 358.7 μmol g−1 after irradiation for 48 hours. Our findings may help to design more active photocatalytic systems for the reduction of carbon dioxide and to introduce an environmentally friendly strategy for selective alcohol oxidation based on photocatalysis.
