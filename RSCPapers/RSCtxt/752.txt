    , Accepted 20th January 2020First published on 21st January 2020AbstractIn this work, a selenophene based double-cable conjugated polymer has been developed for application in single-component organic solar cells (SCOSCs). When incorporating selenophene into the conjugated backbones, the new double-cable polymer exhibited a red-shifted absorption spectrum, a high-lying frontier energy level and good crystallinity. The polymer as a single photo-active layer was applied in SCOSCs, providing a high efficiency of 6.25% with a high photocurrent of 12.68 mA cm−2, which is among the highest performance in SCOSCs. We further studied the nanophase separation of the selenophene based double-cable polymer, revealing that the planar and crystalline conjugated backbones caused poor crystalline cooperativity between the conjugated backbones and side chains containing electron acceptors. This could explain the relatively low fill factor in SCOSCs due to the possibly strong charge recombination.
1. Introduction
Single-component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) that contain a single material in the photo-active layer have been widely investigated in the past two decades due to their simplified fabrication process, high stability and hence potential application in large-area devices.1–26 The single conjugated material requires multiple functions to simultaneously satisfy light absorption, exciton dissociation and ambipolar charge transport in order to convert photons into free charges in one material. Several kinds of conjugated materials, such as molecule dyads,5–7,27,28 block conjugated polymers10–14,16–19,29–33 and double-cable conjugated polymers,3,8,22–24,26,34–37 have been developed for this purpose. However, SCOSCs based on these materials provided unsatisfactory photovoltaic performance with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) below 6%. In contrast, two-component bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have realized PCEs over 16%.38–53 There are two drawbacks that hamper the development of SCOSCs: few species of single-component conjugated materials and the difficulty to control the nanophase separation in these materials. The donor and acceptor segments are covalently-linked, so that crystallization of the two segments is usually restrained, which causes severe charge recombination in SCOSCs.54
In our previous work, we developed an efficient strategy to synthesize double-cable conjugated polymers via constructing monomers that contained perylene bisimides (PBIs) as side units, so that several building blocks, such as diketopyrrolopyrrole,23,24,55,56 isoindigo,57 thienopyrroledione58,59 and benzodithiophene (BDT),22,26,37 that have been widely used in traditional conjugated polymers could be incorporated into double-cable polymers. Therefore, we were able to tune the physical properties of double-cable polymers, such as the absorption, energy levels, crystallinity and charge carrier mobilities. Meanwhile, these samples enabled us to study the nanophase separation of double-cable conjugated polymers. In particular, a double-cable conjugated polymer PBDBPBI-S (Fig. 1a) based on electron-donating conjugated backbones containing chlorinated benzodithiophenes (BDTs) alternating with 5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) units and electron-withdrawing side units containing PBIs was developed. Thermal treatment was found to improve the phase separation in the PBDBPBI-S film, so that SCOSCs based on PBDBPBI-S realized a record PCE of 6.3%.26 This promising performance motivated us to further explore derivatives based on PBDBPBI-S, such as focusing on extending its absorption spectrum to the near-infrared region in order to improve the harvesting of sunlight.

Herein, we have developed a new double-cable conjugated polymer PBDBPBI-Se (Fig. 1a) by incorporating selenophene into the conjugated backbones. It was reported that selenophene had strong electron-donating ability compared to thiophene, so that selenophene containing conjugated polymers showed red-shifted absorption spectra.60 In addition, selenium as a heavy atom is able to enhance the crystallinity of conjugated polymers, which is helpful for charge transport in solar cells.61–63 We also use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the geometry of the conjugated backbones, in which we found that selenophene substituted backbones showed planar structures compared to twisted thiophene-containing backbones (Fig. 1b and c). With these observations, in this work a selenophene based double-cable polymer was synthesized, and the effect of selenophene on the optical, crystalline and photovoltaic properties of PBDBPBI-Se was systematically studied. Finally, a high efficiency of 6.25% could be obtained, which was among the highest PCEs in SCOSCs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis of the polymers
The synthetic routes for the polymer PBDBPBI-Se are presented in Scheme 1 and the detailed procedures are described in the ESI.† PBDBPBI-S and the dibromo-monomer M3 were synthesized according to our previous work.26 PBDBPBI-Se was prepared by using Stille polymerization similarly to PBDBPBI-S. The molecular weight was measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with an eluent of ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) at 140 °C. As shown in Table 1, PBDBPBI-S and PBDBPBI-Se had similar number-average molecular weights (Mn) of 47.7 kDa and 47.1 kDa. PBDBPBI-Se exhibited good solubility in o-DCB but very poor solubility in chloroform and chlorobenzene (CB). In contrast, PBDBPBI-S showed good solubility in CB. These results indicated that selenophene could lower the solubility of PBDBPBI-Se, which may be due to the rigid conjugated backbones.

2.2. Optical, electrochemical and thermal properties
PBDBPBI-Se had a ∼30 nm red-shifted absorption spectrum compared to PBDBPBI-S (Fig. 2a and Table 1), which is consistent with the observation in other Se based conjugated polymers. Both of the polymers show two absorption bands: 400–550 nm from PBIs (region I) and 550–700 nm from the conjugated backbones (region II). PBDBPBI-Se had high absorption intensity in region II compared to that in PBDBPBI-S, indicating that the conjugated backbones in the PBDBPBI-Se film form more crystalline structures.

(c) TGA plots with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under an N2 atmosphere, the temperatures with 5% weight loss for PBDBPBI-S and PBDBPBI-Se are 413.8 °C and 418.0 °C. (d) DSC heating and cooling traces (second cycle) of the two polymers. 
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements provide the frontier energy levels of the two polymers, as shown in Fig. 2b and Table 1. PBDBPBI-S and PBDBPBI-Se exhibited similar lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of −3.64 eV and −3.65 eV, since in double-cable conjugated polymers the LUMO levels are determined by the PBI side units. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels determined by the conjugated backbones in the double-cable polymers are −5.59 eV for PBDBPBI-S and −5.44 eV for PBDBPBI-Se. A high-lying HOMO level was also observed in other selenophene substituted conjugated polymers.62,64–67
The thermal properties of the two polymers were studied by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), as shown in Fig. 2c and d. PBDBPBI-S and PBDBPBI-Se exhibited high thermal stability up to 350 °C. From the DSC measurements, PBDBPBI-S exhibited phase transitions at 325.71 °C during the heating process and at 296.23 °C during the cooling process, while phase transitions were absent in PBDBPBI-Se. Currently, it is very difficult to explain this phenomenon in PBDBPBI-Se, and we may provide speculation: we assumed that the phase transition in PBDBPBI-S is due to the configuration changes of the PBI side units, so that the absence of a phase transition in PBDBPBI-Se revealed that the PBIs in PBDBPBI-Se had disordered nanostructures. This is reasonable since in PBDBPBI-Se the conjugated backbones have strong crystallinity, which will hamper the crystallization of PBIs due to the poor crystalline cooperativity.25
2.3. Charge transport properties in OFETs
Since the double-cable polymers contain conjugated backbones as the donor and PBIs as the acceptor, it is interesting to study their ambipolar transport properties by fabricating organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). As shown in Fig. 3, Table 2 and Fig. S2 (ESI†), both PBDBPBI-S and PBDBPBI-Se exhibited temperature-dependent charge transport properties. The as-cast PBDBPBI-Se thin film had a hole mobility of 5.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the electron mobility was too low to be detected. The as-cast PBDBPBI-S thin film showed a lower hole mobility of 5.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 1.7 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. When the polymer films were thermally annealed at high temperature, the charge carrier mobilities were enhanced with increasing temperature. Interestingly, after the thin films were treated at 280 °C for 10 min, both PBDBPBI-Se and PBDBPBI-S showed similar hole and electron mobilities in OFET devices (Table 2).

According to our previous work, thermal treatment could help the simultaneous crystallization of the conjugated backbones and PBI side units, resulting in nanophase separation between the donor and acceptor.25 This will facilitate the charge transport in thin films and result in high PCEs in SCOSCs. From the OFET devices, it seems that PBDBBPI-Se has good crystalline backbones but disordered PBI units in the as-cast films, while after annealing at 280 °C both of the polymers could obtain similar nanophase separation.
2.4. Photovoltaic performance of SCOSCs
To understand the performance of PBDBPBI-Se in SCOSCs, we fabricated inverted devices with ITO/ZnO as the anode electrode and MoO3/Ag as the cathode electrode. The photoactive layers were spin-cast from PBDBPBI-Se solution in o-DCB, in which the content of additive (1,8-diiodooctane, DIO) and thermal annealing temperature were carefully optimized (Tables S1–S3, ESI†). The photovoltaic parameters of the PBDBPBI-S based SCOSCs are listed in Table 3 for comparison. J–V characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimized devices of PBDBPBI-S and PBDBPBI-Se are shown in Fig. 4.

The SCOSCs based on the PBDBPBI-Se thin film without thermal treatment exhibit a PCE of 1.52% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 5.03 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.92 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.33, which was significantly below that of the PBDBPBI-S based SCOSCs (PCE = 4.33%). This may be due to the low electron mobility of the as-cast PBDBPBI-Se thin film as measured from OFET devices (Table 2). When the thin films were thermally annealed at 230 °C, both the hole and electron mobilities were significantly enhanced, so that the PCE of the SCOSCs based on PBDBPBI-Se was enhanced to 6.25%, which is comparable to the PBDBPBI-S based cells. In general, the PBDBPBI-Se based SCOSCs showed an enhanced Jsc of 12.68 mA cm−2 but a slightly low Voc of 0.84 V and FF of 0.58 as compared to the PBDBPBI-S based cells (Table 3). The enhanced Jsc could be explained by the broad photo-response of the PBDBPBI-Se based cells, as explained by the EQE spectra (Fig. 4b). The low Voc was due to the reduced HOMO level of PBDBPBI-Se (Table 1). The different FFs were related to the charge transportation and charge recombination in the solar cells, which could be further explained by the different crystallinity and nanophase separation as presented in the following section. Interestingly, the SCOSCs based on the PBDBPBI-Se thin film annealed at 230 °C showed red-shifted EQE spectra compared to those based on the as-cast film (Fig. 4b), which was due to the red-shifted absorption spectra (Fig. S3, ESI†).
2.5. Morphology study by AFM, GIWAXS and GIMAXS
We firstly use atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements to study the morphology on the surface of the thin films, as shown in Fig. 5. The PBDBPBI-S thin film without thermal treatment showed isolated small domains on the surface, while the PBDBPBI-Se film showed fibrous structures. After thermal annealing at 230 °C for 10 min, PBDBPBI-S tended to self-aggregate, as evidenced by the black holes in the thin film (Fig. 5b), while PBDBPBI-Se still exhibited a continuous film but with large domain sizes when the film was annealed at 230 °C (Fig. 5f). We infer that, for the thin films annealed at 230 °C, PBDBPBI-S obtained better crystallinity or a stronger aggregation tendency than PBDBPBI-Se.

The thin films were spin-coated on Si substrates and fabricated from different solvents, CB/DIO (0.5%) for PBDBPBI-S and o-DCB/DIO (0.5%) for PBDBPBI-Se. 
We then further use two-dimensional wide (GIWAXS) and medium (GIMAXS) X-ray diffraction to probe the crystallinity of the polymer thin films (Fig. 5 and 6), and their crystallographic parameters are summarized in Table 4. From the GIWAXS patterns, we could conclude that: (1) both PBDBPBI-S and PBDBPBI-Se exhibited enhanced crystallinity after applying the thermal treatment, as evidenced by the enhanced coherence lengths (CLs) of the diffraction peaks (h00) and (010) (Table 4); and (2) the diffraction peaks (h00) appeared in the out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) directions when the thin films underwent no thermal treatment, while they appeared in the IP direction after thermal treatment at 230 °C. However, it is very difficult to distinguish the different nanostructures between PBDBPBI-S and PBDBPBI-Se from GIWAXS. Therefore, we further perform GIMAXS to detect the diffraction peaks at small angles (Fig. 6), in which we studied the crystallinity under three annealing temperatures (25 °C, 230 °C and 280 °C). Firstly, for PBDBPBI-S, only at 280 °C could we observe highly ordered peaks (q1 − q4), while PBDBPBI-Se exhibited highly ordered peaks (q1 − q3) at 230 °C. When further enhancing the temperature to 280 °C, PBDBPBI-Se had similar diffraction peaks to those at 230 °C. These differences indicate that the more crystalline conjugated backbones enable PBDBPBI-Se to realize ordered structures at relatively low temperature. Secondly, it is worth discussing the origin of these highly-ordered diffraction peaks at small angles. In our previous work, we had proposed that q1 with a d-spacing of 6.9 nm in PBDBPBI-S was related to the lamellar distance between the conjugated backbones, and meanwhile peak q3 with abnormally high intensity would be the overlap between lamellar stacking (highly ordered peak) and the peak (001) from the repeating conjugated backbones.26 In contrast, we also observed peak q2 with high intensity in PBDBPBI-Se, which could also be attributed to the overlap between lamellar stacking and peak (001). However, we noted that peak q1 had a d-spacing of 4.7 nm in PBDBPBI-Se, which was much smaller than that in PBDBPBI-S (6.9 nm). This is highly difficult to understand since both of the polymers have quite similar conjugated backbones and side units. Currently, we are unable to provide a rational explanation, which may require further studies.

3. Conclusion
In this work, a selenophene based double-cable polymer PBDBPBI-Se was synthesized. When compared with thiophene based PBDBPBI-S, PBDBPBI-Se has a high-lying HOMO energy level, red-shifted absorption spectrum and a planar conjugated backbone. Studies of OFETs showed that PBDBPBI-Se had temperature-dependent mobilities with the best hole mobility of 3.6 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobility of 1.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 after thermal annealing at 280 °C. PBDBPBI-Se was used as a single active layer to fabricate SCOSCs and obtained a PCE of 6.25% with a Jsc of 12.68 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.85 V and FF of 0.58, which is among the highest performances of SCOSCs. Our results demonstrate that introduction of selenophene into the conjugated backbones of double-cable polymers is an effective strategy to extend the absorption spectra in order to realize high performance SCOSCs.
