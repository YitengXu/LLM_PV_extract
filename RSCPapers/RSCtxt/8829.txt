    , Accepted 21st September 2020First published on 23rd September 2020AbstractFullerenes can generate a triplet state efficiently without invoking the heavy-atom effect. However, their weak absorption in the visible spectral range makes fullerenes not an ideal triplet photosensitizer (PS). Herein, novel truxene-bridged fullerene and Bodipy tetrads were prepared by attaching Bodipy or Zn–porphyrin units (T-2B-C60 and T-B-C60-P) which show a stronger absorption band in the visible spectral range, and the maximum molar absorption coefficient is up to 5.63 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 428 nm for T-B-C60-P. These tetrads show efficient singlet energy transfer from the Bodipy moiety to the fullerene/Zn–porphyrin moiety, the energy transfer rate constant is 2.72 × 109 s−1 and the efficiency is up to 90% for T-2B-C60. Electrochemical and computational studies show that T-B-C60-P exhibits photo electron transfer from fullerene to Zn–porphyrin and a T-B-C60−˙-P+˙ charge-separated state is formed. Nanosecond time-resolved transient difference absorption spectra show that the triplet excited state of T-B-C60-P is distributed on both the fullerene moiety and the Zn–porphyrin moiety, which can be used as the triplet PS for two-color excitable triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion, with a large anti-Stokes shift of 4074 cm−1.
Introduction
Triplet photosensitizers (PSs) continue to attract considerable attention because they can be used in singlet oxygen generation, photovoltaics, photocatalysis, photoredox catalytic synthetic organic reactions, photodynamic therapy and triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC).1–12 Conventional triplet PSs are usually obtained by the introduction of a heavy atom, such as Pt(II), Pd(II), Ru(II), Re(I), Os, Ir(III), I and Br, because the heavy-atom effect can enhance the intersystem crossing (ISC) to generate triplet states.13–22 A small number of other triplet PSs are obtained by establishing a π–π* ↔ n–π* transition.23,24 However, these triplet PSs suffer from drawbacks, such as difficult and costly preparation, weak absorption in the visible range, and narrow absorption band which cannot fully utilize the broadband solar light. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop novel heavy atom-free triplet PSs with a wider and stronger absorption band.
A general method for the preparation of new fluorescent molecules is the derivatization of a known fluorophore. However, this method is not applicable for the design of novel triplet PSs because the subtle derivatization of a known triplet PS may eliminate the ability of ISC completely.8,25–27 On the other hand, there are still no explicit relationships between the molecular structures and ISC.25,28 Thus, it is desired to develop a general molecular structure that can be used to prepare new triplet PSs with a wider absorption band through easy functionalization.
Fullerenes have attracted attention in photochemistry because of their good electron accepting ability. Fullerenes can also be used as an electron spin converter to generate triplet energy with efficiency close to unity.29 However, fullerenes are not an ideal triplet PS due to very weak absorption in the visible range (400–650 nm).30,31 The most typical approach to enhance the absorption in the visible range is through the introduction of visible light-harvesting chromophores based on intramolecular energy funneling (such as resonance energy transfer or photoinduced electron transfer).32–37 These PSs show broadband absorption in the visible region, however, these PSs only make use of a small part of the visible spectral range to generate triplet state and for singlet oxygen photosensitization or photocatalysis. Thus, it would be highly necessary to develop novel triplet PSs with a wider absorption band, which can efficiently harvest panchromatic light excitation to generate triplet state.
Truxene is a C3-symmetric polycyclic aromatic platform with good coplanarity and good thermal stability and exhibits excellent application prospects in constructing active materials as a promising building block in photoluminescence, organic electronics, liquid crystals and gels, and so on.38 Moreover, the truxene unit can be easily functionalized in three directions at C-2, C-7 and C-12 positions to serve as an excellent scaffold for the design of large star-shaped architectures.39 Many diads, triads or more based on truxene linking different chromophores have been synthesized and have shown some potential applications in solar cells,40,41 two-photon absorption,42 organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),43 and organic fluorescent probes.44 In addition, truxene has been proven to be an appealing building block to construct multi-modular D–A systems for application in different energy transfer studies.45,46
To address the aforementioned challenges and considering the distinguishing properties of the truxene moiety, we prepared novel truxene bridged Bodipy, zinc porphyrin, and fullerene tetrads by introducing chromophores of Bodipy and zinc porphyrin units (Scheme 1). This method is useful for designing triplet PSs with a wider absorption band, especially, without relying on precious metals. Through the introduction of the zinc porphyrin unit, the tetrads can efficiently harvest broadband excitation light to generate a triplet state. The process of the singlet energy transfer of these tetrads was studied by steady-state UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, and the triplet energy transfer was also studied through nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopies. Moreover, these tetrads can be used as triplet PSs for triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC). Therefore, our results are very useful for the design and preparation of new TTA-UC materials because there are not any precious metals used in these tetrads.

Results and discussions
Synthesis
The synthesis of tetrads T-2B-C60 and T-B-C60-P is shown in the ESI,† and the details are given in the Experimental section. Briefly, the key intermediate 7,12-dibromotruxene-2-carbaldehyde derivatives were prepared with 1-indanone as the starting material according to the reported literature.47 The porphyrin derivative 4 was synthesized from 5-dihydrodipyrromethane using a modification of a previously reported method.48 Compound 5 was obtained by Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling of 5,5′,10,10′,15,15′-hexaethyl-7,12-dibromo-truxene-2-carbaldehyde with BODIPY-B49 and could be isolated in 12% yield from mono-substituted side products by silica gel chromatography followed by recrystallization in appropriate solvent mixtures. Similarly, T-B and compound 6 were synthesized in sequence via a Pd-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of 5,5′,10,10′,15,15′-hexabutyl-7,12-dibromotruxene-2-carbaldehyde with 1 equiv. BODIPY-B and then compound 4, resulting in 30% and 26% yield, respectively. The target dyad and tetrad T-2B-C60 and T-B-C60-P were obtained by the subsequent 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions using C60 and N-methylglycine (sarcosine) with compounds 5 or 6 in refluxing toluene, in 63% and 62% yield, respectively. The molecular structures of all new compounds were confirmed by NMR, and HRMS (see the ESI†).
UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the compounds were studied in toluene (Fig. 1 and Table 1). T-B shows the characteristic absorption of the truxene and Bodipy units, which is centered at 314 nm and 503 nm, respectively. For these tetrads, i.e.T-2B-C60 and T-B-C60-P, absorption bands centered at 323 nm and 503 nm are observed, which is the characteristic absorption of the C60 and Bodipy moiety, respectively. Moreover, T-B-C60-P also exhibits a strong absorption band at 428 nm and two weak ones at 556 and 597 nm, which are assigned to the Soret band (S2) and the Q bands (S1(v = 1) and (v = 2)) of Zn–porphyrin, respectively. Compared to T-2B-C60, T-B-C60-P shows a broader absorption band, which can be more efficient for the harvesting of solar light. T-B-C60-P shows strong absorption at the Soret band, and the fluorescence emission spectra of compound T-B-C60-P under direct excitation within the Soret band (λex = 405 nm) were studied in different solvents with optical density matched solutions (Fig. 2). T-B-C60-P exhibits five emission bands in toluene, which are attributed to the emission bands of the S2 states of Zn–porphyrin (445 nm), the solvent Raman scattering peak (471 nm), Bodipy (519 nm), S1 state (v = 2) (601 nm) and S1 state (v = 1) (647 nm) of the Zn–porphyrin unit, respectively. The result indicates that the energy of the S2 state of Zn–porphyrin can generate fluorescence by radiation transition, and transfer to the Bodipy moiety by resonance energy transfer, and transfer to the S1 state of Zn–porphyrin via internal conversion. According to the absorption and fluorescence spectra, the energies of the first and second singlet state of Zn–porphyrin and the first singlet state of Bodipy are 2.08 eV, 2.44 eV and 1.75 eV, respectively.

 Fig. 2  Fluorescence emission spectra of T-B-C60-P in different solvents. Optically matched solutions were used (the solutions in each figure show the same absorbance at the excitation wavelength, λex = 405 nm). 25 °C. 
The emission spectra and fluorescence quantum yields of these compounds upon photoexcitation at 470 nm (the characteristic absorption of Bodipy) in toluene were studied (Table 1 and Fig. 3). T-B gives a very strong emission band at 522 nm (ΦF = 74.8%), however, the fluorescence intensity of these tetrads is significantly reduced (ΦF = 7.1% for T-B-2C60, and ΦF = 2.0% for T-B-C60-P). The above result indicates that these tetrads exhibit singlet–singlet energy transfer from Bodipy to fullerenes (T-2B-C60)/Zn–porphyrin (T-B-C60-P) under the photo-excitation.

The fluorescence emission spectra of T-B, T-2B-C60 and T-B-C60-P under direct excitation within the characteristic absorption band of Bodipy (λex = 470 nm) were studied in different solvents with optically matched solutions (Fig. 4). All these compounds show an emission band at 520 nm which is the characteristic emission of the Bodipy moiety, moreover, T-B-C60-P also exhibits two additional emission bands at 600 nm and 650 nm, which are ascribed to the characteristic emissions of the S1 state of Zn–porphyrin. This ensures that the singlet energy of Bodipy can transfer to the S1 state of Zn–porphyrin via the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). For T-B, the fluorescence intensity decreases slightly with increasing solvent polarity from toluene to acetonitrile and methanol. However, the tetrad T-B-C60-P shows a highly solvent polarity-dependent emission, as the polarity of the solvent increases (from toluene to acetonitrile) and the emission intensity at 520 nm decreases significantly, which indicates that PET plays an important role. The emission intensity was quenched in acetonitrile (polar solvent) compared with that in toluene for T-2B-C60. The quenching of the emission in polar solvents indicates that the tetrad T-2B-C60 exhibits intramolecular charge transfer in acetonitrile.

For T-B, the fluorescence decays with a monoexponential feature (Fig. 5), along with the lifetime as 3.2 ns. However, for the tetrads, the fluorescence decay of the Bodipy moiety shows a biexponential character of 0.2 ns (population is ca. 94%)/3.1 ns (ca. 6%) for T-2B-C60, and 0.1 ns (ca. 86%)/3.0 ns (ca. 14%) for T-B-C60-P, respectively, which indicate that the fluorescence-quenching pathway is singlet–singlet energy transfer from the Bodipy moiety to the C60 unit for T-2B-C60, and from the Bodipy moiety to Zn–porphyrin/C60 for T-B-C60-P. On the basis of eqn (1) and (2), the singlet energy transfer rate constants were calculated to be 2.72 × 109 s−1 for T-2B-C60 and 1.65 × 109 s−1 for T-B-C60-P, respectively. The singlet energy transfer efficiency was calculated to be 90% for T-2B-C60 and 84% for T-B-C60-P, respectively. (1) (2,)where  is the singlet state lifetime of the donor in the absence of the energy acceptor; τF is the singlet state lifetime of the energy donor in the presence of the energy acceptor; kET(S1) is the singlet energy transfer rate constants and Eff is the singlet energy transfer efficiency.

Electrochemical measurements
In order to study the potential photoinduced electron transfer (PET), the electrochemical properties of these compounds were studied via cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 6) and their redox potentials are summarized in Table 2. The Gibbs free energy changes of the electron transfer were calculated according to the Weller equation (the details are shown in the ESI†) (Table 3).37,50 For T-B, a reversible oxidation wave and a reversible reduction wave were observed, and the half-wave potential (E1/2) is +0.75 V and −1.68 V, respectively. For T-2B-C60, the first oxidation wave at +0.74 V is due to the electron-donor unit (Bodipy), and the first reduction wave at −1.22 V is due to the electron-acceptor unit (fullerene). According to the Weller equation, the Gibbs free energy change of T-2B-C60 is 0.40 eV in toluene, which indicates that the photo electron transfer from Bodipy to fullerene is thermodynamically inhibited. For T-B-C60-P, the first oxidation wave potential is +0.32 V which is the oxidation potential of Zn–porphyrin, and the first reduction wave at −1.16 eV is assigned to the fullerene. The Gibbs free energy change of T-B-C60-P is −0.05 eV, which indicates that the PET from Zn–porphyrin to fullerene and the formation of a T-B-C60-˙-P+˙ charge-separated state is thermodynamically allowed.

DFT computation
The ground state geometries of T-2B-C60 and T-B-C60-P were optimized (Fig. 7). The center-to-center distance of T-2B-C60 between the electron donor and the electron acceptor was found to be 21.4 Å, which is slightly longer than that of T-B-C60-P (18.1 Å). The radius of Bodipy, Zn–porphyrin and fullerene was 4.2 Å, 8.9 Å and 3.5 Å, respectively. The frontier orbitals of T-2B-C60 and T-B-C60-P are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. S15 (ESI†). Importantly, the HOMO was found to be located on Bodipy moiety for T-2B-C60 and the Zn–porphyrin moiety for T-B-C60-P, respectively. The LUMO of T-2B-C60 and T-B-C60-P was fully localized on the fullerene entity. The confinements of the HOMO and LUMO also suggest the formation of a T-2B+˙-C60−˙ charge-separated state and T-B-C60−˙-P+˙ charge-separated state as a result of the photo-induced electron transfer.

Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy
To investigate the triplet state properties of the compounds, the nanosecond time-resolved transient difference absorption spectra were recorded upon pulsed-laser excitation at 493 nm (Fig. 9). For T-2B-C60, a ground state bleach (GSB) band at 330 nm was observed which is in agreement with the steady-state UV absorption band of fullerene. Moreover, a broad excited state absorption (ESA) band in the range of 600–800 nm was observed, which is ascribed to the characteristic absorption of the triplet state of fullerene.36,37,51 However, the bleaching of the Bodipy moiety was not observed. Thus, the triplet state localized at the fullerene moiety indicates the singlet energy from Bodipy to the fullerene moiety because the Bodipy moiety is selectively excited and the Bodipy unit is without any ISC ability. The lifetime of the triplet state was determined as 32.4 μs. For T-B-C60-P, the GSB band at 429 nm is due to the Zn–porphyrin unit. Just like for T-2B-C60, there are broad ESA bands in the range of 600–800 nm, which is the feature absorption of the T1 state of fullerene. The result indicates that the triplet state is delocalized at both the fullerene moiety (ET1 = ca. 1.60 eV for native C60) and the Zn–porphyrin moiety (ca. ET1 = ca. 1.61 eV),33,52–55 and there is singlet energy from Bodipy to the fullerene moiety and the Zn–porphyrin moiety. The triplet state lifetime of T-B-C60-P with pulsed-laser excitation at 493 nm is 37.6 μs.

Triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion
Based on the triplet state level of fullerene (ca. 1.6 eV),33,55 we selected perylene (Py. 1.53 eV) as the triplet acceptor and emitter for TTA-UC.56 For triplet PS T-2B-C60, the excitation wavelength was selected as 510 nm according to its absorption band. For the triplet PS alone, no emission at 475 nm was observed, however, significant upconverted emission at 475 nm was observed in the presence of Py (Fig. 10), and the upconversion quantum yields were measured as 0.2%. For triplet PS T-B-C60-P, the excitation wavelengths were selected as 510 and 589 nm, which correspond to the S0 → S1 transition of the Bodipy moiety and the Zn–porphyrin unit, respectively. TTA-UC is shown in Fig. 11a. The anti-Stokes shift is 1445 cm−1 and 4075 cm−1, respectively, and the upconversion quantum yields were determined as 0.12% and 0.63% at the excitation wavelength of 510 nm and 589 nm, respectively.

In deaerated toluene. 25 °C. 
According to the triplet level of Zn–porphyrin, PBI was selected as a triplet emitter. The excitation wavelength was selected at 589 nm which corresponds to S0 → S1 transition of the Zn–porphyrin for the triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion of triplet PS T-B-C60-P. No emission in the range of 545 nm was observed in the triplet PSs alone solution, however, significant upconverted emission at 545 nm was observed when PBI was added (Fig. 11b). The anti-Stokes shift was 1371 cm−1 and the upconversion quantum yield was determined as 0.56%. The upconversion is visible to the unaided eye (Fig. 12). With the addition of triplet acceptors, the triplet PSs solution has been a noticeable change in colour. The changes of the emission colour were characterized by the CIE coordinates.
A photophysical process of T-B-C60-P
The photophysical process of T-B-C60-P was summarized in the energy diagram (Scheme 2). Based on the absorption and fluorescence spectra, the energy of the first and second singlet state of the Zn–porphyrin moiety and the first singlet state of Bodipy are 2.88 eV, 2.08 eV and 2.68 eV, respectively. According to the previous report, the energy of the first singlet state of fullerenes, the triplet state of fullerenes and Zn–porphyrin is 1.75 eV, 1.53 eV and 1.53 eV, respectively.55,57 In the case of T-B-C60-P, the energy of the second singlet state of Zn–porphyrin transfers to the first singlet state of Zn–porphyrin and Bodipy via internal conversion (IC) and singlet energy transfer, respectively. Moreover, the energy of the first singlet state of Bodipy can transfer to fullerenes and Zn–porphyrin through singlet–singlet energy transfer, and the rate constants and efficiency of the singlet energy transfer are calculated at 1.47 × 109 s−1 and 82%, respectively. According to the TD-DFT computations, the fluorescence emission spectra in different solvents and electrochemical studies, we speculate that T-B-C60-P exhibits an intramolecular electron transfer process and a T-B-C60−˙-P+˙ charge-separated state could be formed during photoinduced electron transfer. Then the S1 state of fullerenes and the Zn–porphyrin entity can produce the triplet states 3(T-B-C60*-P) and 3(T-B-C60-P*) which are localized at fullerenes and the Zn–porphyrin moiety, respectively, through the ISC process.

Conclusions
In summary, truxene bridged Bodipy and fullerene tetrads T-2B-C60 and T-B-C60-P formed by introducing Bodipy or zinc porphyrin units were prepared. Through steady-state UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectral studies, the tetrads of T-B-C60-P exhibit singlet state energy transfers from Bodipy to Zn–porphyrin. T-B-C60-P exhibits photo-induced electron transfer from Zn–porphyrin to fullerene in toluene, however, the electron transfer from Bodipy to fullerene for T-2B-C60 is thermodynamically inhibited in toluene. Furthermore, the nanosecond time-resolved transient difference absorption spectra suggest that the triplet excited state of T-B-C60-P is distributed on both the fullerene moiety and the Zn–porphyrin moiety. These tetrads can be used as triplet PSs for triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion. The introduction of Zn–porphyrin leads to higher upconversion quantum yields (0.63%) than the introduction of the Bodipy chromophore (0.2%), moreover, an anti-Stokes shift of 4075 cm−1 was obtained which is larger than the anti-Stokes shift obtained by introducing the singlet chromophore (1445 cm−1). Also, due to its broad absorption band and triplet state located on two different moieties, T-B-C60-P can be used as a triplet photosensitizer for two-color excitable triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion.

Singlet oxygen quantum yields determination
The singlet oxygen quantum yields (ΦΔ) of these compound were recorded in toluene with B-2 as the standard (ΦΔ = 82% in DCM). 1,3-Diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) was used as an 1O2 scavenger. The solutions of the compound and the standard should give the same absorbance (adjusted to around 0.2–0.3) at the excitation wavelength (510 nm for T-2B-C60, 550 nm for T-B-C60-P). The 1O2 production was measured by following the absorbance of DPBF at 414 nm upon photo-irradiation of the compound/DPBF mixed solution, and the absorbance of DPBF at 414 nm should be adjusted to around 1. The ΦΔ was calculated according to equation eqn (3): (3)where “sam” and “std” represent the sample and the standard. And Φ, A, K, and η represent the singlet oxygen quantum yield, the absorbance at excitation wavelength, the slope of the absorbance of DPBF at 414 nm changing over time, and the refractive index of the solvent used for measurement, respectively.
Electrochemistry
The cyclic voltammograms were recorded utilizing a PlamStat3+ connected to a computer using PSTrace 5.5 software. A three-electrode system was used consisting of a mini glassy carbon electrode as a working electrode, a platinum wire as a counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode as a reference electrode. The CV measurements were performed in DCM solutions, 0.1 M in tetrabutylammonium perchlorate, and 1 mM substrate at ambient temperature with 100 mV s−1 scan rates.
Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy
The nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectra were recorded on a LP 980 laser flash photolysis spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, UK), and the signal was digitized using a Tektronix TDS 3012B oscilloscope. The compound solutions were excited with an OPOLette 355II + UV nanosecond pulsed laser, the typical pulse length is 7 ns and the wavelength is tunable within the range 210–2400 nm (OPOTEK, USA). The lifetimes were recorded with the LP900 software by monitoring the decay trace of the transients. The compound solutions were degassed by bubbling with N2 for at least 15 min before measurement.
Triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion
A diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) continuous laser (510 nm and 589 nm) was used as the excitation source for upconversion. A VLP-2000 pyroelectric laser power meter was used as the power of the DPSS continuous laser. For the upconversion experiments, the solution of the sample was placed in a specially designed cuvette, degassed by bubbling with N2 for at least 15 min before upconversion measurement, and the gas flow was maintained during the upconversion measurement to prevent oxygen from entering the cuvette, and then excited with the DPSS continuous laser. The upconverted fluorescence was detected using an RF-5301PC spectrofluorometer. In order to dampen the laser beam to reduce laser scattering, a black box was placed behind the fluorescent cuvette. The volume of the solution was kept constant by the addition of solvents to eliminate the effect of evaporation. (4)The triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion quantum yields were calculated according to eqn (4), where Φ, A, I and η represent the quantum yield, the absorbance at the laser wavelength, the integrated emisson intensity and the refractive index of the solvents, where the subscript “std” and “sam” represent the standard and the sample used in the measurement.
DFT computations
All the theoretical calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 program.58 The geometry and electronic structure of these compounds were obtained using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a hybrid functional B3LYP (Becke's three-parameter hybrid functional using the LYP correlation functional) with the 3-21g basis set level for C, H, B, N, and F atoms and the SVP basis set level for the Zn atom.
