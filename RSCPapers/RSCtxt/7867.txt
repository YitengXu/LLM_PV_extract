    , Accepted 15th February 2011First published on 4th March 2011AbstractHigh efficiency (up to 4.5%) and air-stability (>10000 h) of plastics-based and glass-based polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a blended poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) active layer were achieved by the applications of atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) films for four key functions: electron collection, interface optimization, gas-permeation barrier, and thin-film encapsulation. Using a 60 nm ALD ZnO film deposited at 90 °C as the electron-collection layer (ECL), we obtained inverted PSCs with 4.1% power conversion efficiency (PCE) as well as high shunt resistance (Rsh) and low series resistance (Rs), thanks to the low carrier concentration and high electron mobility of the ALD film. Modifying the ZnO ECL's surface with a 0.6 nm ALD HfO2 layer further improved the PCE to 4.5% as a result of enhanced electron injection and hole-blocking. The ALDZnO ECL was also an adequate gas barrier with water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) < 5 × 10−4 g m−2 day−1, eliminating the need for a dedicated gas barrier on the plastic substrates. Combining the ALDZnO ECL with a 26 nm ALD Al2O3/HfO2 nano-composite encapsulating film (WVTR < 5 × 10−4 g m−2 day−1) prevented O2/H2O-induced degradations for the PSCs, achieving > 10000 h of storage lifetime in air. This combination of high PCE and long lifetime presents a significant improvement over current achievable results.
1. Introduction

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) offer many potential benefits over existing inorganic solar cell technologies, including low cost, light weight and flexibility.1–3 Previous studies have demonstrated that via engineering of materials,4–7 device architectures8–10 and device fabrication processes,10–13 and reasonably high power conversion efficiency (PCE) (4–6%) can be obtained from PSCs. However, one significant challenge facing the PSC technology that remains largely unresolved is the short lifetime of PSCs, which mainly results from the high reactivity and instability of the PSC materials.14 One promising approach to improve the stability of PSCs is the inverted device structure (see Fig. 1),10 which allows the use of low-reactivity metals (e.g.Au) for the anode and metal oxides (e.g.ZnO) for electron-collection at the cathode, instead of the conventional low-work-function cathode (e.g. Ca) and corrosion-prone anode stack of indium-tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS).
 Fig. 1  A schematic drawing of a typical inverted PSC structure which was used in this study. 
Despite allowing much improved stability over the conventional devices, the inverted PSC approach still presents some inadequacies: (1) the inverted PSCs still tend to degrade significantly in air,15,16 indicating that a hermetic encapsulation against O2/H2O from air is required; (2) the achievable PCE of the inverted PSCs is generally lower than that of the conventional devices,10,17,18 mainly because of problems associated with the metal-oxide electron-collection layer (ECL) such as poor contact at the ECL/active layer interface and low charge selectivity (i.e. poor hole-blocking due to high doping concentration of the ECL).17 Furthermore, the inverted PSCs can be difficult to implement on plastic substrates due to the fact that the deposition of the ECL typically involves high-temperature processes (e.g. sol–gel for ZnO and TiO2 or thermal annealing for Cs2CO3),15,19,20 which are incompatible with many plastic substrates. Also the plastic substrates need to be coated with gas-permeation barriers, whose added cost can compromise the commercial viability of PSCs.21
This study aims to overcome the above-mentioned challenges to achieve efficient and air-stable plastic- and glass-based PSCs by employing a multipronged approach based on atomic layer deposition (ALD), taking advantages of ALD's capabilities including low deposition temperature, low defect density, and precise control of the film thickness.22 Owing to its unique capabilities, ALD has been used to form ECL (ZnO and TiO2) and encapsulating films for PSCs with good results.23–26 We develop ALD ZnO films that are capable of serving the dual functions as both the ECL of inverted PSCs and the gas-permeation barrier on plastic substrates, tuning the ALD process to obtain the desired properties: plastics-compatible deposition temperature, high electron mobility, low doping (electron) concentration, and low gas permeability. Subsequently, to raise the achievable PCE of the inverted PSCs, we investigate interface modification of the ZnO ECL with an ultra-thin ALD film to improve the contact between the ECL and the active layer. Finally, we combine the ECL/gas barrier with an ALD encapsulating film23 over the PSC devices to complete hermetic encapsulation of the PSCs, and study the degradation behavior of the PSCs. We use blended poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) for the active layer of the PSCs, as this material set has been well-studied and can thus allow clear assessment of the effects of our approach.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 
          ALD
          ZnO electron-collection layer
The key ALD processing factors that affected the electrical properties of the ZnO ECL were examined to obtain the optimal performance from the PSC devices. In terms of the effects of the ALD temperature, both the electron mobility and electron concentration of the ZnO ECL increased with the ALD temperature, with the electron concentration showing a stronger dependence (see Table 1). The higher electron concentration with the higher ALD temperatures indicated a greater amount of oxygen vacancies, which is consistent with the tendency of ZnO films to lose oxygen at elevated temperatures.27 The increase in the electron mobility with the ALD temperature, on the other hand, was attributable to increased crystallinity,28 as can be seen by comparing the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 2) and the SEM micrographs (Fig. 3) of the ZnO ECLs deposited at different temperatures. In the XRD patterns, the ZnO ECL deposited at 150 °C showed significantly stronger ZnO characteristic diffraction peaks than the 90 °C ECL; similarly, under SEM, the surface of the 150 °C ECL contained larger and more distinct crystal grains. It should be noted that below 90 °C, the ALD ZnO films showed an abrupt increase in the impurity level, as indicated by a drastic reduction in the refractive index and a substantial increase in the growth rate per cycle (see ESI†), and therefore ALD temperatures <90 °C were not included in this study.

In PSC devices, the ZnO ECLs from lower ALD temperatures yielded better device performance (see Table 2 and Fig. 4a, devices A, B and C), with the lowest ALD temperature tested, 90 °C, providing the highest PCE (3.4%) as well as Jsc, Voc, and FF. The improvements in the device performance with decreasing ALD temperature mainly originated from the considerably lower dark currents/leakage currents of the devices (Fig. 4b), which were attributed to the enhanced hole-blocking enabled by the lower electron concentration of the lower-temperature ZnO ECLs. The enhanced hole-blocking was also manifested in the higher shunt resistance (Rsh) of the devices (Table 2) with the lower-temperature ZnO ECLs. Despite the enhanced hole-blocking, however, the lower-temperature ZnO ECLs also raised the series resistance (Rs) of the devices (Table 2) due to their lower electron mobility, thereby compromising the achievable device performance. The electron mobility of the ZnO ECLs was found to be significantly limited by the inclusion of residual water in the ZnO ECLs, particularly for the lower ALD temperatures, where the greater condensability of the precursor water rendered it harder to remove completely. The presence of residual water can be observed with X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 5 and Table 1), which shows a pronounced O–H signal from the 90 °C ZnO ECL. The residual water in the 90 °C ZnO ECL was minimized by increasing the purge time for water from 8 s to 25 s, which resulted in considerably lowered O–H signal in XPS (Fig. 5 and Table 1). The lowered water content corresponded to a ∼3-fold increase in electron mobility for the 90 °C ZnO ECL (to 9.6 cm2 V−1s−1) (Table 1), while the desirable low electron concentration of the 90 °C ZnO ECL remained roughly unchanged. It should be noted that prolonging the purge to >25 s did not further reduce the water content or increase the electron mobility, indicating that a condensation-desorption equilibrium of water had been reached with the 25 s purge. The substantially increased electron mobility of the 90 °C ZnO ECL lowered the Rs of the PSC devices, and coupled with the low electron concentration, it raised the FF, Jsc, and PCE (to 4.1%) (see Table 2 and Fig. 4a, device D).

2.2 Interface optimization of the ZnO ECL
The PSC performance achievable with the ALDZnO ECL could be further improved with the application of an ultrathin ALD HfO2 layer onto the ZnO ECL. The extent of the improvement depended upon the thickness of the HfO2 layer, with a maximum PCE of 4.5% occurring at 0.6 nm (see Fig. 6a and device E in Fig. 2 and Table 2). Note that the Jsc value corresponding to the maximum PCE, 11.89 mA cm−2, was verified to be consistent with the value calculated from the integrated incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum (see ESI†), 11.65 mA cm−2, which indicates the accuracy of our reported PCE value. As shown in Fig. 6b, the Rsh of the devices was raised significantly with the addition of the HfO2 layer, and the amount of the rise increased with the HfO2 thickness; meanwhile, the Rs was lowered at smaller HfO2 thickness, but it began to increase at >0.6 nm. The raised Rsh suggested that the HfO2 layer improved hole-blocking at the ECL/active layer interface, which could be expected from the insulating property of HfO2. Interestingly, despite its insulating property, the HfO2 layer reduced the Rs of the devices when its thickness was small, which indicated enhanced electron transport at the ECL/active layer interface. One probable mechanism for this enhancement in electron transport was that the HfO2 layer passivated the ZnO ECL and removed the defect states commonly found on the ZnO surface, thereby suppressing the loss of electrons via charge recombination at such defects.17,29 The occurrence of the optimal HfO2 thickness in terms of device performance indicated that the enhancement in electron transport was negated by the insulating effect of the HfO2 layer, which became dominant at larger HfO2 thicknesses.
 Fig. 6  (a) PCEs and (b) Rs and Rsh of device D with different thicknesses of HfO2 films. The PCEs and Rs, Rsh were determined from J–V characteristics and dark J–V characteristics shown in the ESI.† 
The optimized ZnO/HfO2 ECL was applied to PSCs based on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates, and the resultant PCE was 3.3% with a lower Jsc and FF than those of the glass-based devices (device F in Table 2 and Fig. 4a). The lower device performance of the PET-based devices was attributable to the intrinsic limitations of the substrates: lower optical transparency and higher sheet resistance of the accompanying ITO film. The optical transparency of the PET substrates at the active wavelength range was ∼75% that of the glass substrates, which was comparable with the difference in Jsc between the PET- and glass-based devices. The higher sheet resistance of the ITO electrode on the PET substrates (60 Ω sq−1vs. 15 Ω sq−1 on the glass substrates), on the other hand, corresponded to the higher Rs and in turn lower FF of the PET-based devices.
2.3 Gas-barrier performance of the ALD ECL
Although ZnO films are generally limited as gas barriers due to their crystalline nature, we found that the ALDZnO ECLs could be adequate barriers with appropriate ALD condition, which desirably coincided with the ALD condition for optimal device performance reported in Section 2.1. The gas-barrier performance of the ALDZnO ECLs was evaluated by measuring the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) and helium transmission rate (HeTR) of ITO-coated PET substrates (WVTR = 0.3 g m−2 day−1 and HeTR = 25.4 cc m−2 day−1) overcoated with the ZnO ECLs, and the results are summarized in Table 1. The gas-barrier performance of the ZnO ECLs improved with lowering ALD temperature as a result of the lower ZnO crystallinity at lower ALD temperatures, with the 90 °C ZnO ECL achieving a WVTR below the measurement capability of our instrumentation, 5 × 10−4 g m−2 day−1, with a HeTR of 5.3 cc m−2 day−1. The extended 25 s post-H2O purge, which was found to increase the electron mobility of the 90 °C ZnO ECL in Section 2.1, was also found to improve the gas-barrier performance, resulting in further reduced HeTR with WVTR still below the measurement limit. This was attributable to the lower residual water content of the long-purge ZnO ECL, which would correspond to fewer defects available as gas-permeation pathways.
2.4 Air-stability of the PSCs with ALD encapsulation
The air-induced degradation was eliminated by encapsulating the devices with an ALD HfO2/Al2O3 nanocomposite film. At a total thickness of 26 nm, the nanocomposite film's deposition time matched the optimal annealing time for the device, which was consistent with our previous findings with non-inverted conventional devices;23 additionally, the nanocomposite film obtained WVTR <5 × 10−4 g m−2 day−1 and HeTR = 2.3 cc m−2 day−1. As a result, the encapsulated devices possessed identical device characteristics to the pristine devices, which indicated the absence of encapsulation-induced degradation; moreover, when tested in an accelerated aging environment with 65 °C and 60% RH (Fig. 7), the encapsulated devices, both glass-based and PET-based, obtained nearly identical degradation profiles to the control devices (glass-encapsulated and stored in a glove box at 65 °C), indicating the elimination of air-induced degradation. The effectiveness of the ZnO ECL as a gas barrier was shown in the nearly identical degradation profile of the PET-based devices to that of the glass-based devices. It should be noted that the control and ALD-encapsulated devices still showed non-O2/H2O-related degradation, which was attributed to morphological reorganization of the active layer at the elevated testing temperature. Such effect was far smaller in room-temperature testing, where the devices were able to maintain >70% of their initial PCE for over 10000 h, as shown in Fig. 8.

3. Conclusions
High efficiency and air-stability of plastics-based and glass-based PSCs were achieved by the use of ALD films for four key functions: electron collection, interface optimization, gas-permeation barrier, and thin-film encapsulation. As the ECL for inverted PSCs, ALD ZnO films provided the desirable low carrier concentration and high electron mobility upon optimization of the ALD condition, which involved using a low deposition temperature (90 °C) and a long precursor purge to minimize oxygen vacancies and residual precursor (water) in the films, achieving a 4.1% PCE. Modifying the ZnO ECL's surface with a 0.6 nm ALD HfO2 layer further improved the PCE to 4.5% as a result of enhanced electron injection and hole-blocking. The optimized ZnO/HfO2 ECL yielded a 3.3% PCE for PET-based devices, where the lower PCE compared with glass-based devices was attributed to intrinsic limitations of the PET substrates including lower optical transparency and higher ITO sheet resistance. The ALDZnO ECL was also an adequate gas barrier with water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) < 5 × 10−4 g m−2 day−1, eliminating the need for a dedicated gas barrier on the plastic substrates. Combining the ALDZnO ECL with a 26 nm ALD Al2O3/HfO2 nano-composite encapsulating film (WVTR < 5 × 10−4 g m−2 day−1) prevented O2/H2O-induced degradations for the PSCs, which retained >70% of their initial PCE upon >10000 h storage in the ambient air or upon >1800 h in a 65 °C/60% RH accelerated aging condition. This combination of high PCE and long lifetime presents a significant improvement over currently achievable results. Taking advantage of the unique capabilities of ALD, large area/large batch deposition and low-temperature processing, our approach offers a manufacturing-friendly solution to the development of the PSC technology.
4. Experimental
4.1 Device fabrication
The device structure of the inverted PSCs was: substrate/ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Au/encapsulation layer, as shown in Fig. 1. Substrates included ITO-coated glass (Rite Displays; sheet resistance = 15 Ω sq−1) and ITO-coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (Perm Top Corp.; sheet resistance = 60 Ω sq−1). The fabrication procedure was as follows: (1) ultrasonication in acetone for 20 min followed by rinsing in deionized water; (2) ultrasonication in isopropyl alcohol for 20 min followed by rinsing in deionized water; (3) air plasma cleaning (Harrick Scientific, Model PDC-32G) for 5 min; (4) ALD of the ZnO layer (thickness = 60 nm for all of the ALD conditions tesed; 60 nm has been determined as the optimal thickness of ALDZnO ECLs for inverted PSCs); 24 (5) spin casting of the active layer from a chlorobenzene-based solution of 2.5 wt.% P3HT (Mn = 50000 g mol−1, regioregularity = 98.5%, purchased from Rieke Metals and used as received) and 1.5 wt.% PCBM (purchased from Nano-C and used as received) at 850 rpm followed by baking at 60 °C for 10 min in vacuum (thickness = 210 nm); (6) spin casting of the PEDOT:PSS layer from Clevious P (H. C. Starck) diluted with equal volume of 2-propanol and 0.2 wt.% of polyoxyethylene-6-tridecylether (Aldrich) at 3000 rpm followed by baking at 60 °C for 10 min in vacuum (thickness = 40 nm); (7) thermal evaporation of the Au layer under high vacuum (10−6 torr) (thickness = 150 nm) through a shadow mask which defined an active area of 0.05 cm2; (8) air plasma cleaning for 120 min to remove the organic layers outside the device area and to increase hydrophilicity of the Au surface for better ALD nucleation;30 (9) ALD encapsulation (for experimental devices) or thermal annealing (for control devices), where the control devices were annealed at 140 °C for 60 min (same temperature and duration as the ALD encapsulation process; see below) in a glove box (H2O and O2 < 2 ppm). The control devices were encapsulated with a glass lid sealed with a layer of UV-curable epoxy resin (A1438, Addison Clear Wave; used after degassing in vacuum for 2 h).
4.2 
          Atomic layer deposition

A Savannah 100 ALD system by Cambridge Nanotech Inc. was used to deposit ZnO films for the electron-collection layer, HfO2 films for the interfacial buffer layer and Al2O3/HfO2 nanolaminated films for encapsulation. The precursors used in ALD were as follows: trimethylaluminum (TMA) (purchased from Aldrich with 97% purity) and H2O for Al2O3; tetrakis(dimethylamido)hafnium (TDMAHf) (purchased from Aldrich with ≧99.99% purity) and H2O for HfO2; diethylzinc (DeZn) (purchased from Aldrich with 97% purity) and H2O for ZnO. The deposition temperature was 140 °C for HfO2 and Al2O3/HfO2 and 90–150 °C for ZnO, and the process pressure was 0.1 Torr with high-purity N2 (flow rate = 20 sccm) as the carrier and purging gas. The ALD cycle settings were as follows: (1) Al2O3: 0.03 s pulse of TMA, 2 s soak, 5 s purge, 0.02 s pulse of H2O, 5 s purge; (2) HfO2: 0.1 s pulse of TDMAHf, followed by the same steps as in (1); (3) ZnO (initial 5 cycles for nucleation): 0.06 s pulse of DeZn, 25 s soak, 25 s purge, 0.05 s pulse of H2O, 25 s soak, 60 s purge; (4) ZnO (regular settings, after the first 5 cycles): 0.06 s DeZn pulse, 5 s purge, 0.017 s H2O pulse, 8 s purge. The Al2O3/HfO2 nanolaminated films were deposited by alternating 2 Al2O3 cycles and 3 HfO2 cycles, and the total number of cycles was 235 (thickness = 26 nm), which was such that the ALD process time equalled the optimal duration of thermal annealing (1 h).23 The as-deposited ZnO films were pretreated with a 72 h room-temperature exposure to pure oxygen (1 atm) before use to stabilize their transient concentration of oxygen vacancies.31,32
4.3 Characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSC devices were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated AM1.5G illumination (Newport-Oriel solar simulators with integrated intensity = 100 mW cm−2), which was calibrated with a Hamamatsu silicon photodiode with KG-5 filter33 against an NREL-calibrated solar simulator. The series and shunt resistances were derived from the slope of the J–V characteristic curve under dark conditions close to 2 and 0 V, respectively. IPCE spectra were measured with a spectral response measurement system (SR300, Optosolar) under a 300 W xenon lamp at room temperature. SEM was conducted with a field-emission SEM (JSM-6700F, JEOL) operated at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV with the samples coated with ∼3 nm of platinum. XPS was carried out in a XPS spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) with a monochromatic Al K-Alpha X-ray source (1486.6 eV); samples were slightly sputter-etched (4–5 nm) with Ar plasma in situ before measurement. XRD analysis was carried out in a Panalytical X'pert PRO XRD system with copper Kα line as incident radiation. HeTR was measured at room temperature with an in-house built setup similar to that described elsewhere.34 WVTR was measured with a permeation tester (MOCON AQUATRAN Model 1) with 10 cm2 samples at 40 °C and 90% RH. Carrier concentration and carrier mobility of the ZnO films were measured with a HMS-3000 Hall-effect measurement system operated at room temperature.
