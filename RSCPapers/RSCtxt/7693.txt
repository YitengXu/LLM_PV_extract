    , Accepted 30th October 2017First published on 31st October 2017AbstractWe demonstrate the atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition of methyl ammonium bismuth iodide ((CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 or MA3Bi2I9) films. MA3Bi2I9 possesses an indirect optical bandgap of 1.80 eV and a room temperature excitonic peak at 511 nm. In contrast to recent reports, the films are n-type semiconductors with a room temperature carrier concentration of 3.36 × 1018 cm−3 and a Hall mobility of 18 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are superior to those of solution-processed, undoped films. The precursors used for the deposition are methylammonium iodide and bismuth iodide which are co-sublimated at 199 °C and 230 °C, respectively, in an Ar flow inside a tube furnace with a variable temperature profile. The substrate temperature is set at 160 °C, and dense polycrystalline films (∼775 nm thick) are deposited. Extensive characterization combined with first-principles density functional theory calculations unravels the synthesis–structure–property relationship in these films. The degradation of properties under ambient conditions results from film oxidation with a characteristic bi-exponential decay in resistivity, signifying a fast surface oxidation followed by a slower oxidation of the bulk.
1 Introduction
Lead halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3 and its variants) are promising solar-cell absorber materials with reported power conversion efficiencies that have rapidly increased from1 3.8% in 2009 to an impressive2 22.1% in 2017. The fundamental material properties of lead halide perovskites that drive such progress are their high charge-carrier mobilities,3 high optical absorption coefficient,4 ideal and tunable bandgap5 and ultra-long carrier diffusion lengths up to a few microns.3,6,7
Though the reported power conversion efficiencies of lead halide perovskite solar cells are now competitive with those of commercial silicon solar cells, there are two limitations preventing the commercialization of such solar cells.8 They are (1) the environmental, device and thermodynamic instability9,10 of the perovskites in the presence of air, humidity, light and electric fields; and (2) the toxicity11 due to the presence of lead. Attempts to address stability limitations have included replacing the A-site organic component (CH3NH3+) with inorganic cations,12,13 such as Cs+ and Rb+, or by providing protective overlayers14 that prevent the exposure of lead halide perovskite films to ambient conditions. However, the toxicity due to the presence of lead in these perovskites presents a challenge to further scale-up and eventual commercialization.
Recently, bismuth15–17 (Bi3+) has drawn attention18 as a substituent to the B-site occupied by Pb2+ for ‘lead-free’ perovskites,19 since it is a non-toxic 6p-block element that is isoelectronic20–22 with Pb2+. Reports on the promising optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of methylammonium bismuth iodide (with the formula unit (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 and henceforth called MA3Bi2I9) with a high absorption coefficient23 and long term stability24 have been published. However, MA3Bi2I9 based solar cells suffer from low efficiency.25 Besides the sub-optimal electronic structure of MA3Bi2I9 compared to MAPbI3,17,26 the diminished performance of the solar cells is also attributed to the commonly used solution deposition techniques that result in a poor morphology, purity and coverage of the films on substrates.27,28
Thus in this article, we demonstrate a gas-phase deposition technique for MA3Bi2I9 thin films using a low temperature (160 °C), atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) process. We obtain films with better control over the morphology, purity and coverage with the added advantage of rapid scale-up and integration with other solar manufacturing processes. The APCVD process occurs in a tube furnace by taking advantage of the variable temperature gradient along the length of the tube. Specific temperature zones within the tube are utilized to co-sublimate methylammonium iodide (with the chemical formula unit CH3NH3I and henceforth referred to as MAI) and bismuth iodide (BiI3) into vapor form, which condenses and reacts on the cooler, downstream side of the tube furnace. The result is an n-type, dense and polycrystalline MA3Bi2I9 film with an optical bandgap of 1.80 eV, a room-temperature free electron carrier density of 3.36 × 1018 cm−3 and a Hall mobility of 18 cm2 V−1 s−1. We discuss the synthesis–structure–property interrelationship in MA3Bi2I9 films obtained from a suite of characterization techniques and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
2 Experimental
2.1 Methylammonium iodide preparation
Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was synthesized using minor modifications to a previously published procedure.29 First, 25 mL of methylamine (33 wt% in ethanol, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a 250 mL, three-neck flask maintained at a temperature lower than 7 °C. 10 mL of hydroiodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in water, Sigma-Aldrich) was added dropwise to the flask at a rate of approximately 6 drops per 10 s to the MAI solution while the solution was stirred at 300 rpm. The white MAI precipitate was recovered from the solution using rotary evaporation at a pressure of 60 Torr with the flask in a water bath at 50 °C.
The collected MAI powder was dissolved in 10 mL absolute ethanol while stirring and sonicating for 10 minutes and then precipitated by adding 50–55 mL of diethyl ether to the solution and refrigerating it for 20 minutes. After filtration, the process was repeated 3 times, and finally a white powder was obtained and dried at 60 °C overnight under vacuum using a Schlenk line. The phase purity of the compound was confirmed by using a Bruker D8 Advance powder X-ray diffractometer (ESI S1†).
2.2 MA3Bi2I9 thin film synthesis via APCVD
The MAI powder prepared above was used as the first precursor for the APCVD. BiI3 powder (99%, Aldrich) was used as the second precursor for the APCVD without further purification. A quartz tube mounted on a single zone furnace (Compact Split Tube Furnace with a 1′′ Tube-OTF-1200X-S, MTI Corporation) was used for all APCVD studies. Silicon wafers (Test Grade, University Wafers Inc.) with or without a 100 nm thermal oxide layer, glass slides (48300-025, VWR), pre-cut 5 mm × 5 mm high purity quartz substrates (MTI Corporation) and 2 cm × 2 cm Willow® flexible glass from Corning were used as substrates. The silicon and glass substrates were cut into an approximately 1 cm × 2 cm size, ultrasonically cleaned in DI water, acetone (99.9% Aldrich) and ethanol (99.9% Aldrich) mixture for 10 minutes, washed with IPA and DI water, dried in compressed air, cleaned in UV Ozone (Ossila E511) for 10 minutes, and then immediately placed in the quartz tube, 23 cm away from the upstream end.
The schematic of the experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1a, while a picture of the furnace after successful MA3Bi2I9 deposition is shown in Fig. 1b. The deposition is marked by the characteristic orange color of the MA3Bi2I9 film on the downstream side.15 Initially, 50 mg of MAI and 60 mg of BiI3 were used as sources and placed at 2.5 cm and 13 cm from the upstream end of the quartz tube in alumina boat crucibles. First, the quartz tube was purged with a 280 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) flow of ultra-high purity Ar gas (UHP 300, Airgas) for 10 minutes. The temperature in the quartz tube was then raised at a rate of 1.8 °C per minute until the temperature at the center of the tube reached 230 °C. The furnace was maintained at this temperature for various time periods of 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 180, 240, 360 and 480 minutes of deposition. After deposition, the furnace was naturally allowed to cool down to ambient temperature. This usually took 3 hours.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic of APCVD for MA3Bi2I9 thin films, (b) image of MAI and BiI3 boats inside the tube furnace, and (c) temperature profile of the tube furnace showing the MAI and BiI3 sublimation temperatures and MA3Bi2I9 film deposition temperature. 
The key aspect of an APCVD process lies in the precise placement of the MAI and BiI3 sources along the length of the quartz furnace reactor. This allows us to co-sublimate both the sources together. Fig. 1c shows the temperature profile of the furnace along the length of the CVD quartz tube. This calibration measurement was done prior to the deposition by sliding a thermocouple probe inserted inside the quartz tube with Ar flowing at a rate of 280 sccm. The temperature varies from 199 °C from the upstream end (labeled as 2.5 cm on the x-axis) and peaks to the desired temperature set-point of the furnace (230 °C) at the center of the tube (13 cm from the upstream end). The temperature then drops on the downstream side to 160 °C, 23 cm from the upstream end.
The variability of the temperature along the length of the quartz furnace reactor is exploited in the APCVD process. The MAI boat is placed at 2.5 cm from the upstream side where the temperature is 199 °C which allows the MAI to sublimate. We note that MAI has a melting point of 270 °C. The BiI3 is kept in the middle of the quartz reactor where the temperature is 230 °C. BiI3 has a melting point30 of 402 °C but is known to sublimate as well. Thus, the Ar flow causes the simultaneous transport of MAI and BiI3 vapors to the cooler zone in the downstream region. The condensation and reaction of the MAI and BiI3 vapors take place to produce a MA3Bi2I9 film at around 23 cm from the upstream side, where the temperature is maintained at 160 °C.
Thermogravimetric measurements have been used to calculate the vapor pressure of the two precursors, MAI and BiI3. The details of this analysis are provided in ESI S2.† The enthalpy of sublimation of MAI is obtained from Dualeh et al.,31 as 105 ± 5 kJ mol−1, and for BiI3 it is estimated in this work to be 128 ± 2 kJ mol−1. The sublimation temperatures (Tsub) at atmospheric pressure for MAI and BiI3 are found to be 247 ± 26 °C and 316 ± 2 °C, respectively. Based on this analysis, the partial pressure of MAI and BiI3 when the total pressure is 760 Torr, at the points of sublimation and deposition, has been calculated. The vapor pressure as a function of temperature is provided in Table 1. At the points of sublimation (199 °C for MAI and 230 °C for BiI3), it can be seen that the partial pressure of MAI is higher than that of BiI3 by 4.7×. As the vapor moves downstream, the temperature drops and at 160 °C (i.e., the deposition temperature), the MAI vapor pressure is 87× higher than that of BiI3. Furthermore, the thermodynamic driving force for condensation which is given as32 is found to be −17.57 kJ mol−1 for MAI but −33.9 kJ mol−1 for BiI3 using data from ESI S2.† Here, T is the deposition temperature where, T = 160 °C. This implies that the BiI3 should readily condense on the substrate, nucleate and grow. On the other hand, MAI condensation followed by a solid-state reaction with BiI3 to form MA3Bi2I9 may be a kinetically rate determining step for MA3Bi2I9 film formation. Evidence of this effect will be presented in the Results & discussion section.
Table 1 The partial pressures obtained from thermogravimetric analysis of MAI and BiI3 powders. MAI and BiI3 vapor pressures were calculated at their sublimation temperatures of 199 °C and 230 °C, respectively. The ratio of MAI:BiI3 vapor pressures is 4.7:1. Similarly, at the point of condensation where the temperature is 160 °C, the ratio of MAI:BiI3 vapor pressures was 87:1, indicating a far higher driving force for BiI3 to condense, nucleate and grow

2.3 Film characterization
The film morphology was characterized by using a JEOL JSM-7001 LVF Field Emission SEM under an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. X-ray diffraction (2θ scans) of the deposited MA3Bi2I9 films were obtained by using a Rigaku IV X-ray diffractometer using a Cu Kα X-ray source (λ = 1.5405 Å) within a diffraction angle (2θ) range from 5° to 60°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a PHI Versa Probe II spectrometer (Physical Electronics) with a photon energy of 1486.6 eV (Al Kα). The absorption spectrum of a MA3Bi2I9 film deposited onto an ITO substrate was measured using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 950 spectrometer equipped with a 150 mm integrating sphere, a PMT detector, a tungsten halogen lamp for the visible region (350–800 nm), and a deuterium lamp for the ultraviolet region (250–350 nm). The scan rate for the measurement was 0.4 nm s−1, and the data interval was 1.0 nm. The film was placed in the center of the integrating sphere to collect both the transmitted, T, and the reflected, R, (including the spectrally reflected and diffusely scattered) light with the PMT detector. The transflectance measurement allowed for the absorbance, A, of the film to be determined by A = −log(T + R). To measure changes in the absorption of the MA3Bi2I9 films over time while exposed to ambient conditions, a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer was used to measure the optical transmittance of films deposited on glass substrates.
The electrochemical analysis was performed with a standard three-electrode cell using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) mode in a Biologic potentiostat (SP-200, Bio-Logic SAS) with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. A glassy carbon electrode was used as the working electrode to measure the formal potential of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+), whereas a Pt foil acted as the counter electrode. Silver (Ag) wire in 0.01 M AgNO3 + 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) (98%, Aldrich) in acetonitrile (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the reference electrode (BAS Inc.). The conduction band (CB) energy was calculated from the onset of reduction potential (Ered) values, assuming the energy level of Fc/Fc+ to be −4.8 eV below the vacuum level. The formal potential of Fc/Fc+ was measured to be 0.075 V against a Ag/Ag+ reference electrode in an electrolyte consisting of 0.001 M ferrocene in 15 mL of 0.1 M TBAPF6 in acetonitrile solution. Therefore, from eqn (1) ECB(ELUMO) = −(Ered + 4.725) eV,(1)where the onset potential values (Ered) are relative to the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. The valence band (VB) energy, EVB(EHOMO), was calculated based on the band gap value determined from UV-vis spectra, EVB(EHOMO) = ECB − Eg(indirect). MA3Bi2I9 films deposited on glass slides were dissolved in a solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in acetonitrile for conducting these tests.
All electronic transport property measurements were carried out using a commercial probe station (Janis ST500-1-2CX) with Cu–Be probe tips having 50 μm tip diameter. A Keithley 2400 source meter was used for resistivity measurements on MA3Bi2I9 films deposited on 5 mm × 5 mm high-purity quartz substrates. van der Pauw structures were created by first sputtering 50 nm Pt on the four corners of the quartz substrates prior to MA3Bi2I9 deposition. After MA3Bi2I9 deposition, indium dots were attached to these four corners and served as the contact electrodes for the four probe tips. The corresponding Hall measurements were done by placing an Fe–Nd ring magnet around the sample. The magnetic field strength at the center of the ring magnet was 2135 G. The pressure in the chamber was maintained at or below 1 × 10−4 Torr.
2.4 DFT calculation details
DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).33 We employed the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange–correlation (XC) functional revised for solids (PBEsol).34 The core and valence electrons were modeled using the projector-augmented-wave (PAW) method.35 We used a plane-wave basis set with a cutoff of 500 eV and performed relaxation until the Hellmann–Feynman forces on the atoms were less than 0.001 eV Å−1. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a gamma-centered Monkhorst–Pack36k-point mesh while keeping the k-point density (nk × a), where nk is the number of k-points and a is the lattice parameter, which is equal to ∼26 for structural relaxation and ∼52 for electronic structure calculations. The spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effects were included for calculating the electronic band structure and the absorption spectra. The charge partitioning for the Bader charge analysis was carried out using the approach developed by Henkelman et al.37–39 The elemental charges, used for Bader charge analysis, are the difference between the total valence electrons considered in the PAW potential and the total electrons assigned to an element after the charge density partitioning. The band-edge alignment for MA3Bi2I9 was performed using a surface slab with a material thickness of ∼55 Å and a vacuum of ∼50 Å. The valence band edge (EVB) is calculated using the expression EVB = ϕVAC − εVB, where ϕVAC is the vacuum electrostatic potential and εVB is the eigenvalue for the valence band maxima. The conduction band edge (ECB) is calculated using the expression ECB = EVB + EG, where EG is the band gap calculated using PBEsol with SOC.
3 Results & discussion
3.1 Materials characterization

Fig. 2a shows the color of the films on glass substrates as a function of deposition time. Initially, for short times (<60 minutes), there is hardly any deposition observed. After 90 minutes of reaction, a visible orange color is seen on the glass substrate. We note that there is a stronger color close to the upstream side of the sample, indicating that the deposition is determined by the Ar flow. For deposition times ≥180 minutes, a continuous film is observed on the glass substrate. The orange color is characteristic of MA3Bi2I9.15 The successful deposition of MA3Bi2I9 films on Willow® glass – Corning's flexible glass substrates is shown in Fig. 2b and c. These flexible glass substrates can withstand temperatures up to 500 °C and thus can be used for the APCVD of MA3Bi2I9 films.

(b) MA3Bi2I9 deposited for 360 minutes on Willow® flexible glass of size 2 cm × 2 cm and (c) substrate held in hand. 
High-magnification SEM images are shown for the same substrates in Fig. 3. The mechanistic aspects of the deposition process can be garnered from this sequence of images. First, Fig. 3a–c (i.e., for deposition times 15, 30 and 45 minutes) show isolated hexagonal crystals growing in size from 0.5 μm for 15 minutes to 1.0 μm for 45 minutes of deposition. The crystal shape is characteristic40 of BiI3 and has been independently confirmed through Raman (see ESI S3†) and XRD measurements, as will be shown below. Thus, in the initial part of the deposition scheme, isolated BiI3 crystals (0.5–1.0 μm in diameter) are deposited on the substrate surface.
 Fig. 3  SEM images of APCVD films for varying times of deposition. Scale bar = 500 nm. 
The BiI3 crystals show signs of MAI incorporation starting at 60 minutes (Fig. 3d). While the crystal shapes remain intact, the surface of the crystal shows marked roughness. For 90 minutes (Fig. 3e), the deposited structure becomes interconnected. The interconnected structure shows signs of growth for 180 minutes (Fig. 3f) while the surface structure is rough and full of pinholes.
The surface structure further changes for the 240 minute sample (Fig. 3g), where well-crystallized MA3Bi2I9 grains are visible, though evidence of MAI incorporation can still be seen at the grain boundaries. For the 360 minute sample (Fig. 3h), the MA3Bi2I9 polycrystalline grains are well developed, indicating the complete incorporation of the MAI. However, there are intergranular gaps observed, and such a morphology is not ideal for thin film photovoltaic applications. Finally, for the 480 minute sample (Fig. 3i), we see secondary nucleation of grains in between larger polycrystalline grains.
The secondary nucleation of the MA3Bi2I9 crystals observed in the intergranular regions of the film has been used to grow a dense, compact and polycrystalline film. In Fig. 4a a low-magnification image of the 360 minute sample is shown. The intergranular regions are clearly observed and, as indicated before, are sites for secondary nucleation after 480 minutes of deposition. Therefore, repeating the process (labeled henceforth as 360 minute (2×)) can eliminate these gaps and produce a film with a dense morphology. This is shown in Fig. 4b. While such an approach may take excessively long deposition times, its need is dictated primarily by the limited mass loading of the MAI and BiI3 precursors in our sublimation crucibles. Larger furnace reactors may easily overcome such hardware limitations and yield dense films in a single process run. The ‘twice deposited’ films were subsequently used to conduct all optical and electrical measurements.

(b) A repeat of the same process (i.e., 360 minutes (2×)) eliminates these gaps and produces a dense, polycrystalline film. All optical and electrical measurements were performed on the 360 minute (2×) sample. Scale bar = 2 μm. 
The XRD data of MA3Bi2I9 samples deposited for times varying from 15 minutes to 60 minutes are shown in Fig. 5a. Initially a diffraction peak corresponding to single crystal BiI3 with the violet symbol ‘■’ can be seen. The peak at 2θ = 52.9° can be indexed41 to BiI3 (0012). The other peaks represent MAI, marked by the red symbol ‘●’ (JCPDS ref no. 000-10-0737) at 54.6° corresponding to (222), and a slightly displaced peak from polycrystalline BiI3 (JCPDS 48-1795) given as ‘□’ at 56.2° corresponding to (226). As the deposition time increases, it can be seen that the presence of MAI (JCPDS 10-0737) becomes prominent and the single crystal and polycrystalline BiI3 signals diminish.

(a) Variation of deposition time from 15 minutes to 60 minutes and (b) variation of deposition time from 90 minutes to 480 minutes. Single crystal BiI3 reference is obtained from Boopathy et al., and is indexed to the symbol ‘’ with violet staffs. Polycrystalline BiI3 is indexed to the symbol ‘’ and black staffs and obtained from JCPDS 48-1795. MAI reference is obtained from JCPDS 10-0737 and is indexed to the symbol ‘’ and red staffs. MA3Bi2I9 reference is obtained from Abulikemu et al., and is indexed to the symbol ‘’ and cyan staffs. (c) Crystal structure of MA3Bi2I9 after relaxation along (100) (top) and (001) (bottom) crystallographic directions. 

Fig. 5b shows the XRD for deposition times varying from 90 minutes to 480 minutes. After 90 minutes of deposition, the presence of MA3Bi2I9 is detectable. The MA3Bi2I9 phase is denoted by the cyan ‘♦’ symbol. Here, we note that there are no JCPDS files available for MA3Bi2I9, and we use the patterns generated by Abulikemu et al.,42 to index our peaks. Initially at 90 minutes, peaks at 29.07° (024), 31.6° (025), 32.38° (116) and 44.7° (029) are observed. A strong peak at 24.6° corresponds to MAI (110). Though unlikely at this early stage of deposition, this peak could also represent the MA3Bi2I9 (006) peak at 24.5°. At 180 minutes, the primary peak is still assigned to MAI (110) at 24.6°. Beyond 180 minutes, multiple peaks of MA3Bi2I9 start to emerge. The peak at 24.6° can now be assigned to MA3Bi2I9 (006), given that there are associated peaks, all corresponding to the emerged MA3Bi2I9 phase. Other strong peaks corresponding to MA3Bi2I9 observed are at 23.6° (015), 25.3° (022), 32.2° (116), 41.07° (028), 44.7° (029) and 50.1° (136). The characteristically polycrystalline nature of the MA3Bi2I9 films is in-line with the SEM data since polycrystallinity is clearly shown in the SEM images for 240, 360 and 480 minute samples. Finally, we note that there appears to be a weak peak observed for the 240 minute sample at 35.2° corresponding to the (116) plane in polycrystalline BiI3 which could indicate the concurrent deposition of BiI3 during MA3Bi2I9 formation, but this peak is not detected for the 360 and 480 minute samples.
Next, we compare the lattice parameters from our XRD results to the crystal structure data obtained from first-principles DFT calculations. MA3Bi2I9 exhibits a hexagonal crystal symmetry at room temperature with the P63/mmc space group.43–45 The methylammonium cation (CH3NH3+ (MA+)) shows no preferential ordering in the hexagonal phase.43Fig. 5c shows the DFT-optimized crystal structure of MA3Bi2I9 oriented along [100] and [001] directions. The geometry optimization has been performed using the PBEsol functional,34 which gives good agreement of theoretical lattice parameters with the experimental values. The calculated lattice parameters from DFT are 8.72 Å, 8.27 Å and 21.76 Å, which are, respectively, within 1.77%, 3.47% and 0.01% of the experimental43 lattice parameters of the hexagonal phase. Since, we use a static ground-state orientation of the MA cation in our DFT calculations, the ideal hexagonal P63/mmc symmetry of the lattice is broken, which results in lowering of the symmetry for the relaxed structure. Instead the DFT relaxed structure exhibits a monoclinic symmetry with the space group Cc, which is a subgroup of P63/mmc.
The MA3Bi2I9 structure can be thought of as a derivative of the perovskite (ABX3) structure. In both cases the B-site cation (Bi in the case of MA3Bi2I9) is octahedrally coordinated by X-site anions (I in the case of MA3Bi2I9). However, as compared to the ideal perovskite structure, only 2/3rd of the total octahedral sites are occupied by the Bi cation in A3Bi2I9 compounds.16 Additionally, as opposed to the corner-connected octahedral network of BX6 octahedra in perovskites, MA3Bi2I9 forms a layered structure consisting of isolated Bi2I93− bioctahedra. These bioctahedra are formed by two face-shared BiI6 octahedra, which share three I anions (Fig. 5c).

Fig. 6 shows the XPS fine spectra of the 15, 180 and 480 minute MA3Bi2I9 films whereas the full survey spectra of these samples are provided in ESI S4.† In Fig. 6a, the C 1s fine spectrum is shown. For the 15 minute sample, the primary peak is at 284.5 eV corresponding to the C–C bond related to adventitious carbon. There is a slight shoulder detected at 282.6 eV, which is related to the C–N bond46 originating from MAI. The C–N bond increases in strength for the 180 minute sample and dominates the C 1s signal for the 480 minute sample. These data suggest that MAI incorporation in the BiI3 is a slower process than the BiI3 condensation, nucleation and growth process. This conclusion is in line with earlier observations made from the vapor pressure calculations in Table 1 as well as the SEM images in Fig. 3.

N 1s, Bi 4f and I 3d XPS fine spectra are provided in Fig. 6b–d, respectively, and the peak positions are shown in Table 2. For the N 1s, the 15 minute sample shows a weak signal but the signal progressively grows stronger for the 180- and 480 minute samples indicating MA+ incorporation. The N 1s peak position shifts to a lower binding energy from 402.0 eV to 401.5 eV. The Bi 4f and I 3d peaks are strong even at 15 minutes and indicate the presence of BiI3. MA+ incorporation produces a shift to a lower binding energy of 0.7 eV and 0.5 eV in the Bi 4f and I 3d peaks, respectively. The peak-shifts indicate electron transfer to the N, Bi and I during the transformation of BiI3 to MA3Bi2I9.

To explain the shifts in the XPS spectra, Bader charge analysis has been performed for each element during the chemical reaction leading up to the formation of MA3Bi2I9. The average Bader charges for each elemental species in MA3Bi2I9, MAI and BiI3 are shown in Table 3. Recall that in Fig. 6a, the intensity of the de-convoluted C–N peak increases as the reaction proceeds, indicating an increased presence of C–N bonds with increasing reaction time. The C–N bonding occurs at a higher binding energy compared to the C–C bonding, signifying the loss of electrons in the C atom upon N addition. From the Bader analysis, one finds the loss of electrons in the C atom confirmed by the higher atomic charge on C in MA3Bi2I9 (+0.453 ± 0.015)e than in MAI (+0.445e). However, for N there is disagreement between the calculated charge transfer and the shift in the XPS peak presented in Fig. 6b. According to the calculated Bader charges, the average charge on N is (−2.982 ± 0.009)e and (−3.029e) for MA3Bi2I9 and MAI respectively, which means that the N anion is being oxidized while going from MAI to MA3Bi2I9. However, this charge transfer is not supported by the shift in the XPS peak towards a lower binding energy with increasing reaction time, which points towards the reduction (gain in electrons) of the N anion. This disagreement could be attributed to the weak XPS intensity for N at reaction times of 15 and 180 minutes, which makes the determination of charge transfer difficult with the N 1s fine spectra.

The Bi cations in MA3Bi2I9 have an average charge of (+1.049 ± 0.002)e compared to +1.061e in the reactant BiI3 and are, therefore, in a reduced state in MA3Bi2I9 as compared to BiI3. This reduction of the Bi cation is also supported by the shift in the experimental XPS peak towards a lower binding energy as shown in Fig. 6c. On comparing the average Bader charge of I anions in the primary reactants, i.e. the weighted average of the Bader charge of I in MAI and BiI3 (−0.459e) to that in MA3Bi2I9 (−0.472e), we find that the I anions are also reduced. This gain of electrons is also confirmed by the shift of the XPS peak for the I anion towards a lower binding energy as shown in Fig. 6d. Moreover, the reduction of Bi and I ions in MA3Bi2I9 with respect to the reactants (MAI and BiI3) is accompanied by a simultaneous oxidation of the MA cations in MA3Bi2I9 with respect to MAI, which balances out the net charge transfer. The net reduction of Bi and I requires a total charge transfer of 0.141e per formula unit of MA3Bi2I9 to Bi and I (0.024e for Bi and 0.117e for I). This charge transfer is achieved by a transfer of electrons from MA cations to Bi and I as the reaction proceeds. The net average charge on MA cations is (+0.668e) and (+0.715e) in MAI and MA3Bi2I9 respectively, which amounts to a net charge transfer of 0.141e per formula unit of MA3Bi2I9 from MA to Bi and I.
Finally, the charge transfer in H can be categorized into two types, based on the position of H in the MA cations. H atoms directly bonded to C and those directly bonded to N lead to two different bonding environments. The H atoms bonded to N show an atomic charge of +1 for both MA3Bi2I9 and MAI, whereas the H atoms bonded to C show an average atomic charge of +0.081 and +0.084 in MA3Bi2I9 and MAI, respectively. This difference in the atomic charge is due to the higher electronegativity of N than C, which makes the H–N bonds more ionic than the H–C bonds.
3.2 Optical characterization

Fig. 7a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the 360 minute (2×) MA3Bi2I9 film at wavelengths between 400 nm and 800 nm. The absorption onset of MA3Bi2I9 was observed at approximately 600 nm. The presence of a peak at 511 nm before the onset of continuous absorption is attributed to excitons.42,44,47,48 We have verified separately that the MAI and BiI3 absorption spectra do not contain an exciton peak. This exciton peak has also been observed for single crystals of MA3Bi2I9 at temperatures between 78 K and 301 K, and it starts to broaden as the temperature increases.47 The thickness dependence of the exciton levels is shown in ESI S5† where a stronger and narrower exciton peak is observed for a thinner film (∼480 nm), whereas a broader exciton peak is observed for a thicker (∼1000 nm) film.
 Fig. 7  (a) UV-vis spectra of the MA3Bi2I9 film. Exciton peak is extracted and a Tauć plot of the baseline is used to measure the indirect bandgap of 1.8 eV. (b) DFT-calculated band structure for MA3Bi2I9 with a calculated indirect bandgap of 1.77 eV (red arrow) and direct bandgap of 1.89 eV (black arrow). (c) Cyclic voltammetry curve (vs. Ag/Ag+ electrode) for MA3Bi2I9. (d) Band edge information from experiment (UV-vis + CV) and DFT calculations. 
The bandgap of MA3Bi2I9 films was calculated first by establishing a baseline and removing the exciton peak from the absorption spectrum and then by plotting the baseline as a Tauć plot and using the equation49 αhν = β(hν − Eg)n(2)where α is the absorption coefficient, hν is the photon energy, β is a constant, and Eg is the bandgap; a linear fit is used to extract the bandgap. Assuming that the lowest energy optical transition in MA3Bi2I9 is indirect (see DFT calculations below), n = 2 is used in the evaluation. The inset of Fig. 7a shows the Tauć plot, and the extrapolated bandgap is 1.80 eV. The value of the MA3Bi2I9 bandgap is in line with those reported by Lyu et al.20

Fig. 7b shows the electronic band structure of MA3Bi2I9 calculated using PBEsol with spin–orbit coupling (SOC) along the high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. Using the PBEsol functional and SOC effects, we find that MA3Bi2I9 has an indirect band gap of 1.77 eV from K (1/3, 1/3, 0) in the valence band to (0.05, 0.05, 0) in the conduction band as shown in Fig. 7b. The calculated direct band gap is 1.89 eV and occurs at (0.075, 0.075, 0). The indirect and direct transitions are shown as red and black arrows respectively in Fig. 7b. MA3Bi2I9 exhibits relatively flat bands as compared to more promising organohalide perovskite solar cell absorbers such as CH3NH3PbI3,50,51 which is typical of A3Bi2I9 compounds17 because of the disrupted octahedral-connectivity along all three crystallographic directions.
We also calculated the band structure using the hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) functional with SOC effects,52 which is known to result in better band gap estimation for a variety of semiconductors, as shown in ESI S6.† We find that HSE06 overestimates the bandgap with an indirect band gap of 2.41 eV from K (1/3, 1/3, 0) in the valence band to (0.05, 0.05, 0) in the conduction band, and a direct band gap of 2.53 eV at K (1/3, 1/3, 0). Both the indirect and direct transitions are shown as red and black arrows respectively in Fig. S6.†
To extract the experimental band edge positions of MA3Bi2I9, CV measurements are shown in Fig. 7c. MA3Bi2I9 has the reduction peak edge at Ered = −1.22 V. Referring to eqn (1), the MA3Bi2I9 conduction band edge position is therefore calculated to be ECB = −3.505 eV with respect to vacuum. Using the bandgap obtained from UV-vis (1.80 eV), the valence band edge position is calculated to be EVB = −5.30 eV. The data from UV-vis + CV measurements and DFT calculations are summarized in Fig. 7d.
3.3 Electrical characterization
For the MA3Bi2I9 film deposited twice (360 minute (2×)) on the quartz substrate, conductivity was measured using a van der Pauw four-point configuration. The conductivity is 9.7 S cm−1 (i.e., resistivity 0.103 Ω cm) at room temperature for a film with a thickness of 775 nm (see ESI S7† for thickness measurement using the cross-sectional SEM image). The detailed result is shown in Table 4 along with the comparison of electrical data from other reports.15,44 This conductivity is 1168× better than the reported conductivity (0.0083 S cm−1) of a solution-processed,20 500 nm MA3Bi2I9 film highlighting the importance of the type of synthesis in determining film properties.

Room temperature Hall measurements were performed to determine the conductivity type, carrier mobility and concentration of the MA3Bi2I9 film. According to the measurements, the Hall coefficient is negative, which indicates the carriers to be n-type for the CVD MA3Bi2I9 film. This result is in contrast to the solution processed MA3Bi2I9 film which shows p-type conductivity.20,53 Furthermore, the calculated carrier concentration of the CVD MA3Bi2I9 film is 3.36 × 1018 cm−3, which is 2 orders higher in magnitude than that of solution-based, undoped MA3Bi2I9 films.20,53 Finally, the mobility was estimated to be 18 cm2 V−1 s−1. This is higher compared to the mobility reported by Lyu et al.,20i.e., 1 cm2 V−1 s−1, and Vigneshwaran et al.,53i.e., 2.28 cm2 V−1 s−1. The improved carrier concentration and mobility highlight typical advantages that vapor phase processing of MA3Bi2I9 films have over solution-based techniques including minimal impurities and better crystallinity and film morphology.
3.4 Film stability
It has been reported that MA3Bi2I9 is stable under ambient conditions, thus presenting a significant advantage over other organic halide perovskite candidates.54 However, in our work we find that the MA3Bi2I9 film exposed to ambient conditions (room temperature, 45% humidity and 1 atm) undergoes changes in its composition and degradation in its optical and electrical properties. In Fig. 8a, a loss of N is detected in the MA3Bi2I9 film exposed to ambient conditions in just 5 days. The absence of N has been observed by Li et al.,55 for degraded Pb-based perovskite films as well. Furthermore, in ESI S8,† we provide the XPS 1s fine spectra of O and 4f of Bi in the MA3Bi2I9 film. The O 1s shows the characteristic O peak associated with surface adsorbed hydroxyl groups with an additional shoulder corresponding to Bi–O bond formation after 5 days and growing stronger after 14 days of exposure to ambient conditions. Similarly, the Bi 4f shows signs of oxidation as well after 5 days. Fig. 8b shows XPS fine spectra of I 3d7/2 and 3d5/2 for fresh films and for films exposed for 5 and 14 days to ambient conditions. Unlike N and O, there is no noticeable change observed in the I 3d fine spectra after 5 days. However, shoulders appear for the I 3d7/2 and 3d5/2 peaks on the higher binding energy side after 14 days, indicating the oxidation56 of I. Thus, from the XPS data it can be concluded that, while the loss of surface N and oxygen incorporation (most likely associated with Bi) is a rapid process, iodine oxidation is a slower process.
 Fig. 8  (a) XPS fine spectra of N 1s show the absence of N after just 5 days exposure to ambient conditions. (b) XPS fine spectra of I 3d for fresh and after 5 (no change) and 14 days under ambient conditions. The splitting of the 3d peaks after 14 days at higher binding energy indicates the oxidation of the iodine. (c) UV-vis spectra from day 0 (fresh) to day 5 show a gradual decay of the excitonic peak while insets show the actual film color fading, and (d) change in the exciton peak intensity (black, left axis) and electrical resistivity (red, right axis) as a function of number of days exposed to ambient conditions. The increase in resistivity follows a bi-exponential decay with time constants 0.1 and 1.7 days. 
The compositional changes in MA3Bi2I9 are accompanied by changes in optical and electrical properties. Fig. 8c shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the MA3Bi2I9 film exposed to ambient conditions over a period of 5 days. The characteristic 511 nm exciton peak disappears on day 5. Correspondingly, the insets in Fig. 8c show the film color changes from bright orange to a pale shade of yellow. In Fig. 8d, the excitonic intensity at 511 nm (black, left axis) and the 4-wire resistivity (red, right axis) are plotted as a function of time over a five day period. A bi-exponential model involving two time constants is used to fit the increase in resistivity over time. Two time constants, τ1 = 0.1 day and τ2 = 1.7 days, are obtained with a model fit that has an adjusted r2 ∼ 0.99.
The XPS analysis along with the bi-exponential decay of resistance suggests that two decay mechanisms might be operative in the degradation of the MA3Bi2I9 films. First, the time constant τ1 = 0.1 day could indicate the surface oxidation of MA3Bi2I9 where the Bi may be oxidized to Bi2O3. In line with this assumption, it can be seen that the exciton peak intensity only slightly degrades in the initial period. This is because the surface Bi2O3 layer may provide temporary protection24 from further attack by ambient O2, keeping the excitonic modes active in the bulk. On the other hand τ2 = 1.7 days indicates the slower diffusion-limited oxidation of the bulk MA3Bi2I9, and as the film gets oxidized after day 4, the exciton peak intensity rapidly degrades.
4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated an atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition process for the deposition of a MA3Bi2I9 film. The film is deposited using co-sublimation of methylammonium iodide (kept at 199 °C) and BiI3 (kept at 230 °C) as precursors in a flow of inert argon. The temperature of deposition is 160 °C. The key advantage of this synthesis approach is that the deposition is at atmospheric pressure and at low temperatures, which opens the possibility for depositing MA3Bi2I9 films in high volume, cleanroom compatible, manufacturing environments. The deposition on flexible Willow® glass has been demonstrated.
Well-developed crystals are obtained after 360 minutes of deposition. Repeating the process twice leads to dense, high quality polycrystalline films. The optical bandgap is measured to be 1.80 eV. Room temperature Hall measurements on 775 nm thick MA3Bi2I9 films indicate them to be n-type with a carrier concentration of 3.36 × 1018 cm−3 and a Hall mobility of 18 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are superior to those of solution processed, undoped films. The MA3Bi2I9 films oxidize under ambient conditions in a matter of ∼5 days and in the process, (1) N is lost, (2) excitonic peaks are quenched, and (3) resistivity increases with a bi-exponential decay with time constants related to a fast surface oxidation mechanism, followed by a slower oxidation of the bulk film.

 	Fig. 2  (a) Optical images of APCVD MA3Bi2I9 films on a glass substrate for varying times of deposition. Arrow represents the direction of the Ar flow in the furnace. Scale bar = 1 cm. (b) MA3Bi2I9 deposited for 360 minutes on Willow® flexible glass of size 2 cm × 2 cm and (c) substrate held in hand.	 

 	Fig. 3  SEM images of APCVD films for varying times of deposition. Scale bar = 500 nm.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Low magnification image of the MA3Bi2I9 film deposited for 360 minutes showing the intergranular gaps in the polycrystalline film. (b) A repeat of the same process (i.e., 360 minutes (2×)) eliminates these gaps and produces a dense, polycrystalline film. All optical and electrical measurements were performed on the 360 minute (2×) sample. Scale bar = 2 μm.	 

 	Fig. 5  XRD of films as a function of deposition time. For clarity, the XRD has been split into two graphs. (a) Variation of deposition time from 15 minutes to 60 minutes and (b) variation of deposition time from 90 minutes to 480 minutes. Single crystal BiI3 reference is obtained from Boopathy et al., and is indexed to the symbol ‘’ with violet staffs. Polycrystalline BiI3 is indexed to the symbol ‘’ and black staffs and obtained from JCPDS 48-1795. MAI reference is obtained from JCPDS 10-0737 and is indexed to the symbol ‘’ and red staffs. MA3Bi2I9 reference is obtained from Abulikemu et al., and is indexed to the symbol ‘’ and cyan staffs. (c) Crystal structure of MA3Bi2I9 after relaxation along (100) (top) and (001) (bottom) crystallographic directions.	 

 	Fig. 6  XPS fine spectra obtained from 15, 180 and 480 minute MA3Bi2I9 thin films showing (a) C 1s, (b) N 1s, (c) Bi 4f and, (d) I 3d. The carbon 1s peak has been deconvoluted into two peaks related to adventitious carbon (284.5 eV) and C–N from the methylammonium group.

 	Fig. 8  (a) XPS fine spectra of N 1s show the absence of N after just 5 days exposure to ambient conditions. (b) XPS fine spectra of I 3d for fresh and after 5 (no change) and 14 days under ambient conditions. The splitting of the 3d peaks after 14 days at higher binding energy indicates the oxidation of the iodine. (c) UV-vis spectra from day 0 (fresh) to day 5 show a gradual decay of the excitonic peak while insets show the actual film color fading, and (d) change in the exciton peak intensity (black, left axis) and electrical resistivity (red, right axis) as a function of number of days exposed to ambient conditions. The increase in resistivity follows a bi-exponential decay with time constants 0.1 and 1.7 days.
