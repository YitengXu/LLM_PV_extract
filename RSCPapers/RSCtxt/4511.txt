Our first-principles calculations predicted that the preferred doping sites of B and P atoms in hydrogen-passivated silicon nanowires have opposite distribution behavior under electric field, suggesting a steady intrinsic p-n junction can be spontaneously formed in (B and P) codoped silicon nanowires.
In recent years, silicon nanowires (SiNWs) have been under extensive study because of their attractive properties and applications, such as building blocks of devices, nanosensors, and solar cells.1–3 Compared with the bulk silicon, quantum confinement effect has shown a large influence on the electronic structure of SiNWs. The great advances in the synthesis techniques endow SiNWs many more advantages in applications than other one-dimensional materials, such as carbon nanotubes. Many theoretical works have been performed to provide an atomistic understanding of electronic structures of pristine SiNWs, including stain effect, chemical passivation, surface reconstruction, and growth orientations.4–12
The electronic structures of SiNWs can be changed by impurity doping. Experiments have shown that p-type and n-type SiNWs doped by B and P atoms have a larger possibility of functional device applications.13,14 Recently, doped SiNWs with p-type and n-type carriers on the different terminals of SiNWs, just as p-n junctions, have demonstrated their potential as solar cells, which have high energy conversion efficiencies. The new finding opens the door for SiNWs to power electronics, and demonstrates them as diverse nanosystems,15–17 and encourages the studies of readily fabricating such junction-like structures based on SiNWs.18,19 However, experimental results have revealed that the p-type dopants can automatically combine with the n-type ones, and form donor–acceptor pairs.20 It is clear that the doped atoms can easily transfer in the doped SiNWs under adequate temperature. The donor–acceptor pair deactivates the carriers, and destroys the p-n junctions. Obviously, such donor–acceptor pair hampers the functionality and applications of SiNWs devices. Concerning the theoretical aspects, the dopant-related (B and P atoms) sites and electronic structures of SiNWs have been intensively investigated with ab initio calculations,21–24 and the results indeed show that B and P co-doping leads to the formation of donor–acceptor pairs.
In this paper, we studied the effect of external electric field on the doping sites of B and P atoms in SiNWs with density functional theory method. Our study suggests the preferred doping site of B and P atoms can be controlled with the external electric field, implying the possibility to build intrinsic p-n junctions in SiNWs.
To study the site preference in doped SiNWs, we chose the SiNWs oriented in the [100] direction with a diameter of 1.37 nm as an example, as shown in the Fig. 1. Along the nanowire direction, a doubled unit cell is used to avoid the interaction between the doped atoms. B and P atoms are introduced into the SiNWs as the dopants to get p-type and n-type carriers, respectively. The external electric field is applied along the x direction, which means the electric field is perpendicular to the nanowires.

Our electronic calculations are performed by means of density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in VASP.25 The projector augmented wave (PAW)26 method in its implementation of Kresse and Joubert27 is used to describe the electron-ion interaction, and the cut-off energy is set to 400.0 eV. The convergence in energy and force is 10−5 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. The GGA of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof, known as PBE,28 is used for the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).
Because the diameter of SiNWs fabricated in experiments are normally above ten nanometres, the inside sites are more important than the surface sites.21–24 In our research, we ignore the surface sites, and focus on inside sites of the nanowires. First of all, we investigate the effect of electric field on the single doped B and P atoms in SiNWs. As shown in Fig. 1, we select four possible sites inside the nanowires, marked as 1, 2, 3, 4. By introducing B atoms into the SiNWs, sites 1 and 4 have the same stability, and are energetically more favored than sites 2 and 3. The same situations can be observed in P-doped SiNWs.
Interestingly, when an external electric field is applied, both doped B and P atoms have a large response, but with opposite behaviors. For B-doped SiNWs, when a positive voltage is applied, we find the relative stability of site 1 is reduced, and all the other sites become more stable than site 1 under the electric field of 0.5 V Å−1. However, when the applied electric field is a negative voltage, the relative stability of site 1 is increased, compared with other sites. These calculations show that the doping sites can be randomly selected between site 1 and 4, and just depends on the applied electric field. Naturally, it is important to check whether P-doped SiNWs have the same effects under electric field. The following calculations indeed find the same picture, but with different trend. As shown in Fig. 1(d), by applying a positive voltage, the relative stability of site 1 is enhanced, compared with other sites. This phenomenon is totally different with the B-doped SiNWs. While the electric field is reversed, the relative stability of site 4 is increased.
The response of single doped B and P atoms inside the SiNWs under electric field is very important, and provides the possibility of controlling the doping sites. Besides the inside sites, we also check whether such effect can work at the surface sites. Ab initio calculations show that the surface sites have the same response, coinciding with the inside sites of SiNWs.
Although the doped sites of B and P atoms have a linear relation with the applied electric field, it is necessary to understand the intrinsic mechanics. In Fig. 2, the partial charge density of doped hole and electron states are plotted for B and P doped SiNWs. It is very clear that the doped hole and electron states are mainly distributed around the doped atoms. Thus, the interaction between the doped atoms and the electric field has a large difference with the silicon atoms. This is the reason why the doped sites can be selected by the electric field. On the other hand, because of the computational limits, we cannot do the same studies with larger silicon nanowires. It is our belief that the revealed physical mechanics in small nanowires also works for the larger nanowires, but the strengthening of the electric field effect may lead to a slight difference in ionization energy than that in smaller nanowires.29,30

To investigate the effect of the electric field on the electronic structures, we plot the density of states of B and P doped SiNWs in Fig. 3. It is clear that n-doped and p-doped characters of P and B doped SiNWs are kept under all external electric field, which means the electronic properties are not changed by the electric field.

As we know, the donor–acceptor pair is harmful for any useful applications of B and P co-doped SiNWs. Since doped B and P atoms have different site-preference under electric field, it is anticipated that such a pair can be destroyed by the electric field, and form spontaneous p-n junction. To confirm the predictions, we performed the following calculations. As shown in Fig. 1(a), B atom is fixed at site 0, while the P atom is doped at 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. The co-doped configurations are marked as 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4, with the distances between the B and P atoms of 1.94, 3.69, 4.47, and 6.55 Å, respectively. As expected, without electric field, 0-4 has the lowest energy by forming the B–P pair. Co-doped configurations are less stable with longer distances between the B and P atoms, as shown in Fig. 4. When an external electric field with 0.25 V Å−1 is applied, configuration 0-4 is still the most favored, but the stability is reduced, compared with other doped configurations. Increasing the electric field to 0.5 V Å−1, we find all the other configurations, namely, 0-1, 0-2, and 0-3, are more stable than the 0-4. Configuration 0-1 becomes the ground structures, which means B and P atoms distribute at two different terminals of the SiNWs under electric field. Importantly, the donor–acceptor pair is destroyed, and spontaneous p-n junction is formed under electric field.
Our results have shown a clear trend that doping sites can be tuned by external electric field. But as we know, the dopants are difficult to move in silicon nanowires because of the strong interaction of dopants and silicon atoms. Therefore, high temperature is necessary to manipulate the doping sites under the applied electric field
Conclusions
In summary, we have performed comprehensive DFT calculations to investigate the effect of electric field on the doping sites in SiNWs. Our results show that both in the p-type (B atoms) and n-type (P atoms) SiNWs, the doped atoms have a large response under electric field. Such a response makes the doped sites selected by the electric field, and keeps the activity of carriers. Because of the opposite responding behavior of B and P atoms under electric field, the B–P pair in SiNWs is destroyed, and spontaneous p-n junction can be formed. We also suggest the high temperature is important to relocate the position of impurities under electric field, which can help to overcome the energy barriers.
