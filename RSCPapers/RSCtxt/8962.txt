    , Accepted 23rd February 2021First published on 8th March 2021AbstractThis work explores a new methodology to adsorb a subphthalocyanine molecule (SubPc) on a hybrid lead bromide perovskite crystal structure with the aim of extending its photoresponse into the visible region. This process consists in the preparation of multidimensional 2D–3D perovskites. The use of large organic cations allows the possibility to insert guest molecules in the crystal structure of the perovskite. In this work, layered and 3D materials are obtained modifying the ratio of the organic cations (A/R) in the perovskite structure (RNH3)2An−1BnX3n+1. The present results show that incorporation of metal-free subphthalocyanine in the interlayer space provided by the 2D phase is a valid procedure to enhance the photoresponse of the perovskite solar cells.
1 Introduction
Hybrid halide perovskite materials have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years, due to the fast photon to current efficiency reached in a very short period, having competitive values compared with silicon solar cell technology. In addition to photovoltaics, these materials show other promising applications as light emitting diodes,3 lasing materials4 or gas sensors.5 These hybrid perovskites adopt the chemical formula ABX3 in three-dimensional (3D) structure, where A and B are cations of different sizes and X are halides. There are more than one hundred different possible perovskites,6 most of them still to be discovered. Although rapid progress has been made, these materials are still under intense study due to the various possibilities to modify their structure and composition.
Recently, 2D–3D multidimensional perovskites have emerged as promising materials because they combine the high performance of 3D perovskites, and the long-term stability of 2D perovskites. 2D perovskites contain hydrophobic bulky alkylammonium cations in their crystal structure to terminate the lattice, this could effectively block the interaction with the external moisture. Its generic formula is (RNH3)2An−1BnX3n+1, where RNH3 is a primary aliphatic or aromatic alkylammonium cation, A is monovalent organic cation, B is a divalent metal, X is the halide ion, and “n” is the number of 3D perovskite layers separating the alkylammonium cation. The “n” value may vary from 1 to ∞, corresponding respectively, to a 2D or 3D structure.
Complete 2D structures present several drawbacks such as higher exciton binding energy and lower light absorption.7 However, it has been demonstrated that multidimensional 2D–3D perovskites show enhanced carrier lifetime, mobility and diffusion length, and reduced trap density.8 Depending on the bulky alkylammonium cation and the proportion with the organic cation, combined properties can be achieved.9 Relative to the 3D materials, 2D–3D multidimensional perovskites are able to incorporate a wider range of large organic cations, and they possess the flexibility to introduce other guest molecules that confer new properties or functionalities. Although, this strategy has been used in other 2D materials such as layered double hydroxides or graphene-based materials,10 herein, for the first time we report the incorporation of a subphthalocyanine into the interlayer space of multidimensional 2D–3D perovskites. At present, there are only scarce works dealing with the incorporation or doping of 2D–3D perovskites with small organic molecules11,12 different from the typical cations and anions studied in the perovskite doping.13 The inclusion of metal particles14 has been demonstrated as valid approach to enhance the photoresponse of the active material. Therefore, the interlayer space of the 2D component in the 2D–3D multidimensional perovskite enables the capability of different types of guest molecules to be intercalated, while the pure 3D configuration shows a more limited possibility.
Boron subphthalocyanines (SubPcs) derivatives have received considerable attention for their use in photovoltaics.15–18 SubPc are aromatic chromophore molecules with cone–shaped structure, good solution processability, intense optical absorption in the visible spectral region, appropriate electron mobility, and tunable energy levels.19,20 During the last decade, organic SubPcs have successfully been applied in the field of photovoltaics as light harvesters due to their excellent optical and semiconducting properties.21–24
Recently, SubPcs have also been used as hole transport materials (HTM) for organometallic halide perovskite solar cells because of its stability and long excitation diffusion length,16,25 showing its potential as alternative to the most commonly used spiro-OMeTAD.26,27 A protective effect of the SubPc over the perovskite preventing from degradation has also been reported,16 or as passivating agent of the defects within the perovskite film.28 The present manuscript deals with the incorporation of the phenoxy-iodo-boron subphthalocyanine (PhO,I-SubPc) derivatives onto 2D–3D lead bromide perovskites, increasing their visible light absorption, as well as improving their stability against degradation.
At the moment, organometallic halide perovskite solar cells having iodine in the structure, offer the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE),29,30 since these hybrid perovskites exhibit full coverage of the visible wavelength range. However, the introduction of iodine anion offers less stability against UV light and moisture compared with perovskites based on bromide.31 Bromide perovskites offer good stability, but its optical bandgap of 2.31 eV limit light absorption in the yellow-red part of the visible spectrum. Herein, we combine the photoresponse of the hybrid bromide perovskite with the SubPc as light harvester, in order to maximize the absorption in the visible spectrum and as protective layer.
Hence, the incorporation of SubPc in the interlayer space of 2D–3D perovskites expands the photoresponse in the visible region. SubPc incorporation was achieved by selectively controlling the composition during the synthesis. This new strategy shows better photoresponse, demonstrated in polycrystalline samples and single crystal. The composition of SubPc and perovskite precursors was also evaluated in order to properly incorporate the SubPc between the layered 2D–3D perovskite.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Chemicals
All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich apart from ITO quartz substrates that were supplied by Ossila.
2.2 Synthesis of subphthalocyanines

2.2.1 Synthesis of chloro, iodo-subphthalocyanine (Cl,I-SubPc). 
Synthesis of Cl,I-SubPc was carried out following a modified version of the classical reported synthesis.32 4-iodophthalonitrile (0.9164 g, 3.61 mmol, 1.5 eq.) was placed in a 2-necked round bottomed flask, anhydrous p-xylene (13 mL) was added, and the mixture was stirred under inert atmosphere until everything dissolved. BCl3 (2.4 mL, 1 eq.) was then added dropwise and the reaction mixture was heated at reflux temperature (140 °C) for 4 h. The reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature and the solvent evaporated under reduce pressure, the resultant crude was dried under vacuum. The resultant solid was washed first with cold methanol and then with cold hexane, followed by filtration. The title compound was isolated as dark purple solid (0.9168 g, 94%). 1H-NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, 298 K): δ (ppm) = 9.25 (br s, 3H), 8.60–8.57 (m, 3H), 8.27–8.23 (m, 3H). UV-Vis (CH2Cl2): λmax (nm) = 572.


2.2.2 Synthesis of phenoxy, iodo-subphthalocyanine (OPh,I-SubPc). 
Synthesis of OPh,I-SubPc was carried out following the reported literature protocol.33 Cl,I-SubPc (0.8111 g, 1.003 mmol, 1 eq.) and an excess of phenol (0.4768 g, 5.015 mmol, 5 eq.) were placed in a round bottomed flask and dissolved in toluene (3 mL). The mixture was refluxed under inert atmosphere until completion (24 h) and subsequently cooled down to room temperature. The resultant solid was then transferred to another flask and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. This crude product was washed with cold hexane and cold methanol, and filtered to yield the pure title product as purple solid (0.7904 g, 91%). 1H-NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, 298 K): δ (ppm) = 9.19 (br s, 3H), 8.54 (d, 3H, J = 8.4 Hz), 8.21 (d, 3H, J = 8.4 Hz), 6.76 (t, 2H, J = 7.5 Hz), 6.64 (t, 1H, J = 7.5 Hz), 5.35 (d, 2H, J = 7.5 Hz). UV-Vis (CH2Cl2): λmax (nm) = 569.

2.3 Synthesis of polycrystalline hybrid perovskite with 2D–3D structure (n = 10 and 50)
Following this stoichiometry, (R)2(A)n−1BnX3n+1, perovskite structures from layered to 3D materials have been prepared modifying the ratio of organic cations A/R. This strategy is based on the use of large alkyl ammonium cations that form low-dimensional perovskites. Perovskite with n = 10 is the focus of this paper, however, n = 50 and 3D structure perovskites were also prepared for comparison. Solutions containing different concentrations of the precursors in DMF were prepared n = 10, 0.1 M phenylethyl ammonium bromide (PEABr), 0.45 M methyl ammonium bromide (MABr), 0.5 M lead bromide (PbBr2); n = 50, 0.02 M PEABr, 0.49 M MABr, 0.5 M PbBr2. In case of the 3D structure, the classic perovskite synthesis was followed.34 Blank perovskite samples lacking OPh,I-SubPc were also prepared in order to verify the insertion of the OPh,I-SubPc into the structure.
The hybrid perovskite samples with and without OPh,I-SubPc were prepared following the drop casting method. The experimental protocol involves washing the quartz substrates with anionic detergent (Alconox) and milliQ water in an ultrasonic bath. The substrates were subsequently treated with a hydrochloric acid solution (1 M) for 24 h to increase the surface hydrophilicity. Finally, the quartz substrates were thoroughly rinsed with ethanol and dried. Then, the above mentioned precursor solutions in the appropriate concentrations were deposited onto the quartz surface (10 μL) in a ratio (1:1:1), and 1:1:1:1 when preparing the OPh,I-SubPc-containing materials. Hence, 10 μL of a previously prepared solution of SubPc (5 wt%) in DMF was added. The mixture was left to slowly crystallize overnight at room temperature. Orange-pinkish crystals were obtained.
2.4 Synthesis of single crystal hybrid perovskite with 2D–3D structure (n = 10) via antisolvent method
Single crystal hybrid perovskites were slowly crystallized following the antisolvent method, that consisted on dissolving the precursors (0.1 M PEABr, 0.45 M MABr, 0.5 M PbBr2) in a small amount of DMF (1 mL), and adding an aliquot of the previously prepared solution of SubPc (20 μL). This mixture was placed in a quartz substrate on a Teflon stage in a close vial, and THF was used as antisolvent (5 mL). The vessel was fully closed and kept in the dark until small orange-pinkish crystals were observed. The crystals were manually selected with Gel-Pack and a micromanipulator to perform the corresponding characterization.
2.5 Preparation of hybrid perovskite solar cells
The following experimental protocol was followed for the preparation of the hybrid perovskite-SubPc solar cells: (1) ITO cleaning step: Quartz substrates containing ITO (thickness 1.1 mm and specific size 20 mm × 15 mm) were washed with ethanol; (2) preparation of TiO2 dense layer: firstly, the clean substrates were heated in a hotplate at 450 °C for 30 min. Then, titanium(IV) isopropoxide (0.762 mL), and acetylacetone (0.5125 mL) were dissolved in absolute ethanol (9 mL). The mixture was deposited by spray coating onto the quartz substrate (1.5 mL) that contain the ITO layer. An inert gas was used as carrier. Finally, the substrates were heated up to 450 °C for 30 min and then cooled down to room temperature to obtain a completely dense TiO2 film; (3) preparation of mesoporous TiO2 scaffold layer: a solution of a TiO2 paste (18NR-T) (35 μL) diluted in absolute ethanol (0.020 g paste: 1 mL ethanol) was deposited onto the substrates by spin-coating (2000 rpm/45 s). The films were firstly dried on a hotplate at 50 °C for 30 min, then the substrates were annealed in an oven at 450 °C for 1 h, and finally they were cooled down to room temperature; (4) preparation of SubPc@HP10 perovskite films: following the stoichiometry to n = 10 ((RNH3)2(A)9B10X31) a mixture of perovskite precursor solutions 0.1 M PEABr, 0.45 M MABr, 0.5 M PbBr2 and OPh,I-SubPc (10, 30, 50 wt%) were deposited onto the substrate. This step was performed in a glove box under inert atmosphere; (5) preparation of hole-transporting layer Spiro-OMeTAD: the preparation of hole-transporting layer was also carried out in a glove box. First the lithium salt solution was prepared dissolving lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (0.170 g) in acetonitrile (1 mL). Then, 16.6 μL of this solution was mixed with chlorobenzene (1 mL), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) (7.69 μL) and Spiro (0.200 g). The Spiro-OMeTAD solution (30 μl) was spin coated on the surface of the perovskite-SubPc films (3000 rpm for 45 s). The solvent was fully evaporated heating the sample in a hotplate at 110 °C for 1 hour; (6) preparation of Au electrode: 40 nm layer of Au electrode was deposited onto the previously prepared substrate by vacuum evaporation coating.
2.6 Single crystal characterization
The optical and electrical properties, specifically photoluminescence (PL) and photocurrent, of single crystals were obtained by means of an in-house built setup.1,2 Characterization at the single crystal level allows to determine the variability of the properties among particles due to surface passivation, crystal size and defects. These studies are useful to understand the response of the bulk material and what could be the maximum activity under optimal conditions. Basically, it includes two branches, one for excitation and the other one for signal acquisition, both focused by 20× Mitutoyo objectives at the same spot, with a typical size of about 1 μm. In the experiments reported here, both branches were oriented so that the collected light was in forward direction with respect to the incident or exciting light. The signal acquisition branch includes an iris, where the spot is focused. It allows selecting the signal from a sample area of micrometer range and even submicrometer range. After the iris, a motorized mirror drives the signal either to a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, by means of which, the exact part of crystal being examined can be visualized, or to a spectrometer (iHR320-HORIBA), which is equipped with a liquid nitrogen refrigerated Si-CCD, and it is used for measuring the spectrum of the collected light. For photoluminescence measurements, a 405 nm wavelength beam provided by a solid-state laser was used as excitation source. In all of the cases, to minimize crystal degradation, a moderate intensity of about 0.1 mW was used.
2.7 Characterization
XRD patterns of the powders and thin films were recorded on a Philips X'PERT diffractometer that was equipped with a proportional detector and a secondary graphite monochromator. The data were collected stepwise over the range 2θ = 2–20°, at steps of 0.02°, an accumulation time of 20 s per step, using the Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å).
UV–Vis optical spectroscopy of the perovskite films was carried out using a Cary 5G spectrophotometer and CaSO4 as reference.
Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were recorded with a Zeiss Ultra 55 field FESEM apparatus.
2.8 PL measurements
PL spectra of the films were carried out using an optical microscope (Leica DM4000). It includes a module for fluorescence characterization, which consists of a mercury lamp and a Leica bandpass filter (340–380 nm) as illumination source, and an Avantes AvaSpec-2048 Fiber Optic Spectrometer, which provides a resolution better than 0.5 nm.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization
We first studied the incorporation of SubPc in pure 3D perovskite with MAPbBr3 structure, however the incorporation of this macrocyclic compound was unsuccessful. This can be explained considering the rigid, close-packed structure of the cubic 3D configuration where substitution of the organic cation causes strong distortion of the octahedral framework due to the limited ionic radii of the methyl-ammonium cation. Fig. S2 and S3† displays the scanning electron microscopy image (HRSEM) and the XRD spectrum. Large amounts of SubPc aggregates over the crystalline perovskite were observed (Fig. S2†), also the perovskite diffraction peaks did not suffer any change (Fig. S3†), and the ICP analysis confirmed the absence of SubPc in the 3D perovskite.
In comparison with close-packed 3D perovskite, 2D–3D perovskites depict a layered structure incorporating large organic cations that can facilitate insertion of SubPc molecules. As previously mentioned, n value relates to the number of perovskite layers in the 2D–3D configuration. In the preparation of the multidimensional perovskite, we selected high n values (n = 10 and 50) for the incorporation of the SubPc compound. These values correspond to a quasi-3D perovskite and provide the advantage of combining the outstanding properties of the 3D perovskites and the stability of the 2D structure.
As described in the preparation section, 2D–3D perovskites containing SubPc molecules were obtained following the typical one-step crystallization procedure employed for the preparation of crystalline perovskite layers.35Fig. 1a indicates the different steps followed for the incorporation of SubPc in the perovskite structure. Basically, a solution of the different precursors in DMF is deposited by drop or spin coating on a clean substrate. Afterwards the sample is washed with toluene in order to remove any possible excess of SubPc. To obtain the reference sample, we also prepared 2D–3D perovskite without SubPc. In addition, Fig. 1b shows a graphical representation of the SubPc molecules inserted in the interlayer space together with the PEA cation used for the formation of the 2D phase (SubPc@HP 2D–3D).

The samples were characterized by XRD, electronic microscopy and UV-Vis absorption. In the case of XRD characterization, all the prepared samples show the characteristic peaks at 2Θ 14.77 and 29.95 assigned to the (100) and (200) crystal planes that correspond to the cubic phase and indicating high crystallinity. In addition, the influence of the SubPc loading with respect to the “n” value of the hybrid perovskites was studied. Table 1 shows the influence of the SubPc loading on the diffraction peak shift of hybrid perovskite samples at two different n values, 10 and 50 (SubPc@HP10 and SubPc@HP50). Typically, insertion of a guest in the layered space produces a change in the spacing between the layers, which results in a shift of the low-angle diffraction peak. Peak shifting was observed in both hybrid perovskite samples (n = 10 and 50). Nevertheless for the lower n value (n = 10), the loading of SubPc was higher, and the shift of the diffraction peak (100) was, accordingly, more larger. Thus, the shift in the XRD (100) peak supports the incorporation of the SubPc in the interlayer structure (see Fig. 2). In addition, this diffraction peak (100) is also dependent with the SubPc loading as it is shown in Fig. S4.† This also supports the incorporation of the SubPc in the interlayer space.

The SubPc loading was measured by ICP, in all cases, a low dye loading, lesser than 3 wt% was determined. This low amount of SubPc incorporated in the structure can be explained considering the limited interlayer space of the 2D phase and the crystal strain.
The samples were also characterized by electron microscopy (Fig. 3); uniform crystal shapes were observed for both n = 10 or 50, however, for low “n” values, a more layered structure is apparent. Moreover, in contrast with the full 3D structure where aggregates appeared on the external surface of the crystallites (Fig. S2†), the presence of SubPc was indistinguishable for the hybrid 2D–3D perovskite crystals. Both, XRD and FESEM data indicated that the incorporation of SubPc preserves the structure of perovskite and confirm the uniform formation of multidimensional 2D–3D perovskite. As long as similar results were observed for the n = 10 and 50, the subsequent presented results are focus on the n = 10 as the SubPc loading is somewhat higher (SubPc@HP10). Moreover, 3D molecular model shows that the interlayer space formed by the PEA cation is sufficient to incorporate the SubPc into the 2D perovskite phase (see Fig. S5†).

3.1 Optical properties
The optical properties of the SubPc@HP10 material were determined by measuring the absorption and the photoluminescence spectra. Fig. 4 shows the diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra of the polycrystalline thin films without and with incorporated SubPc. The appearance of a new absorption band in the region between 550 to 650 nm was attributed to the SubPc contribution (Fig. 4, violet pattern), that interestingly remain visible even at low SubPc concentrations (loading less of 1%). This is due to the characteristic high absorption coefficients of subphthalocyanines, i.e. Q band ranging from 5–6 × 104 dm3 mol−1cm−1.36,37 To study the influence of SubPc incorporation on the optical properties, the steady-state emission in the polycrystalline samples and single crystals was also measured (see Fig. 5). In polycrystalline samples, a broad emission band between 450 to 750 nm is observed, with a less-defined peak maximum probably due to light scattering by the particles and the influence of defects on the surface and interphases. Single crystal characterization is a well know platform to study the intrinsic optical properties of materials due to the absence of grain boundaries, absence of non-crystalline domains and lesser influence of structural defects. In this regard, PL measurement using our in-house built confocal microscope (see Experimental section) of a single crystal, shows a well-defined emission with two main bands at 550 and 600 nm that can be assigned based on the emission maxima of the perovskite and subphthalocyanine, respectively. The Q band of the SubPc suffers a hypsochromic shift when it is located inside the perovskite structure. This shift can be explained considering two main factors, the polarity of the surrounding ionic environment and steric stress of the SubPc molecules due to the crystal packing in the interlayer space.

3.2 Electrical characterization
To gain further insight into the optoelectronic properties of the new SubPc@HP material, we also measured the photocurrent spectra on isolated single crystals. For this purpose, a selected single crystal was firstly deposited onto a conductive ITO electrode, and a micrometric tip was used as top contact. A detailed description is given in the Experimental section. The spectral response was measured at room temperature under a nitrogen flux. A tuneable monochromatic source was focused on a single crystal, recording the photogenerated short circuit current at the microcrystal. The set-up is schematically shown in Fig. 6B and a detailed description is given in the Methodology section. The photocurrent measured at different wavelengths is depicted in Fig. 6A, the response of the bromide perovskite increases in the visible region with a new band exhibiting current up to 650 nm. This enhancement in the photoresponse indicates that SubPc molecules are participating in the charge generation process upon illumination, and acts as light harvester for long wavelength radiations.

3.3 Photovoltaic devices
After characterization of the optical and electrical properties of the SubPc@HP10 material, perovskite solar cells were prepared. A thin dense layer of TiO2 was used as hole blocking layer (HBL) deposited over the transparent conducting electrode (ITO). Then, a thin porous layer of nanocrystalline TiO2 (Dyesol) was deposited by spin coating onto the dense TiO2 layer, and the layers were then sintered at 450 °C. The porous layer was infiltrated by spin coating with a solution of SubPc@HP10 and thermally annealed. Subsequently, hole transport layer of Spiro-MeOTAD was deposited on top of the active material (Scheme 1). Finally, a gold metallic layer was also deposited on top of the Spiro-MeOTAD as cathode electrode (see Experimental section for more details).
 Scheme 1  Device configuration for SubPc@HP solar cell. 
The SubPc loading into the hybrid perovskite sample employed in the preparation of the photovoltaic devices, was studied employing three different SubPc loadings of 0.65, 1.8 and 2.9 wt%. It was determined that the maximum loading of SubPc inserted in the crystalline structure of HP was 2.9 wt% (n = 10). It was also observed that the use of higher concentrations of SubPc produces aggregation of the macrocyclic compound in the form of crystals on the perovskite surface, which has a negative effect on the performance of the perovskite solar cells. This is in agreement with the previous observation by Xu et al.,38 where large amounts of SubPc can hinder the electron transfer process.
The SubPc insertion in optimal amounts results in an improved device performance of the perovskite solar cells, and a 20% efficiency enhancement compared with the reference devices without SubPc molecules (Fig. 7). This enhancement has been only observed when concentrations of SubPc lower than 1 wt% are used. This suggest, that although the current maxima at short circuit conditions increases due to the enhanced response in the visible region, the final Voc decreases, and this can be explained considering an increase of the internal resistance of the active HP layer after SubPc incorporation. In this regard, it has also been observed that the Voc in inverted perovskite solar cells using conducting polymers as hole selective contact, is influenced by the alignment of the energy levels of the active perovskite and the electron and hole transporting interfaces.39 Therefore this reduction in the Voc could be due to internal resistance due to the shorter charge carriers migration paths in the hybrid SubPc∝HP material. A summary of the results obtained for the photovoltaic devices is summarized in Table 2. Furthermore, we have performed comparative stability measurements upon continuous irradiation in air conditions, without any encapsulation, and after 10 h the loss of efficiency is about 5% for the device that contains SubPc and 10% without SubPc (see Fig. S6†). This suggest that SubPc confers some protective effect and this agrees with the observation by other authors.16,28

3.4 Proposed mechanism
The operation mechanism of 2D–3D mixed perovskites still remains unclear, this is due to the larger binding energy of photogenerated excitons in the layered structure and the boundaries for the diffusion of the free charge carrier along the structure. Some studies have proposed an energy transfer mechanism from layered to 3D-like perovskite network,40 or that the local intrinsic electronic structure of the edges of the perovskite layers provides a dissociation process of the excitons into free carriers.41 Herein, the energy level diagram shown in Scheme 2 is proposed, considering that for n = 10 the energy of the CB/VB increases with respect to the 3D configuration.42 A similar trend has been observed for quantum size effects in colloidal quantum dots.

Based on the band diagram it can be expected that the 2D component can favour the charge separation in the multidimensional 2D–3D crystal structure as previously described.43 Besides, as proved by the photocurrent spectrum SubPc is a light harvester that due to the appropriate band alignment, can act as electron and hole relay between the 2D and 3D in the structures. This leads to a more favourable electron transfer from the SubPc and 2D structure, to the 3D phase and hole transfer from the 3D phase to the 2D layered structure (Scheme 2). The presence of different types of defects in 3D perovskites has been demonstrated experimentally and theoretically.44,45 Common types of defects in perovskites act as shallow traps that introduce intermediate energy levels in the electronic structure due to vacancies and interstitial defects.46 Normally, shallow traps only reduce mobility and delay the extraction process, resulting in diminution of the maximum current density extracted from the device. Nevertheless, in our case, it appears that the shallow levels facilitate the charge separation process from the perovskites phases and the SubPc, resulting in an increase of the current density of the SubPc@HP10. The smaller VOC can be attributed to the increase in internal resistance of the material due to the presence of SubPc.
4 Conclusions
A new approach to expand the photoresponse of hybrid lead bromide perovskites by incorporation of SubPc molecules in the interlayer space of the 2D structure is described. The new material has been characterized and studied in polycrystalline samples, and isolated single crystals, showing that a small SubPc loading enhance the photoresponse of the hybrid bromide perovskites, acting as light harvesting units. Measurements in perovskite solar cells confirm that this approach is a promising direction to enhance the efficiency of this family of materials. Although the overall efficiency still needs improvement, the results of SubPc@HP perovskites open new avenues for perovskite design, presenting many opportunities to design functional materials based on this outstanding class of chromophores.
