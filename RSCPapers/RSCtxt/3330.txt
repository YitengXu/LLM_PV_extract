    , Accepted 3rd June 2016First published on 3rd June 2016AbstractEnergy independent, yet higher than 90% internal quantum efficiency (IQE), has been observed in many organic photovoltaics (OPVs). However, its physical origin remains largely unknown and controversial. The hypothesis that the lowest charge-transfer (CT) state may be weakly bound at the interface has been proposed to rationalize the experimental observations. In this paper, we study the nature of the lowest-energy CT (CT1) state, and show conclusively that the CT1 state is localized in typical OPVs. The electronic couplings in the donor and acceptor are found to determine the localization of the CT1 state. We examine the geminate recombination of the CT1 state and estimate its lifetime from first principles. We identify the vibrational modes that contribute to the geminate recombination. Using material parameters determined from first principles and experiments, we carry out kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to examine the charge separation of the localized CT1 state. We find that the localized CT1 state can indeed yield efficient charge separation with IQE higher than 90%. Dynamic disorder and configuration entropy can provide the energetic and entropy driving force for charge separation. Charge separation efficiency depends more sensitively on the dimension and crystallinity of the acceptor parallel to the interface than that normal to the interface. Reorganization energy is found to be the most important material parameter for charge separation, and lowering the reorganization energy of the donor should be pursued in the materials design.
1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with bulk heterojunction morphologies offer promise for the realization of a low-cost, lightweight, printable and flexible renewable energy source.1–3 The power conversion efficiency of OPVs has steadily improved over the past decades and is approaching 10%.4–6 Despite the tremendous progress in the field, fundamental understanding of how free carriers are generated at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface still eludes us, hindering further development of OPVs to reach their full potentials. It is generally believed that charge-transfer (CT) states or excitons are precursors to free carriers and thus play a crucial role in charge separation.7–10 A CT state is a Coulomb-bound electron–hole (e–h) pair across the D/A interface, formed either through electron transfer from the optically excited donor to the acceptor11,12 or through direct phonon excitation at the interface.13,14 Due to the low dielectric constant (≈3–4) in organic semiconductors, the e–h binding energy of CT excitons is estimated to be in the range of 0.3−1 eV, much higher than the thermal energy at room temperature.15–17 However, despite such a large binding energy, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of high performing OPV devices can exceed 90%,13,18,19 implying that almost every absorbed photon would result in a pair of free carriers which are collected at the electrodes. How such strongly bound e–h pairs could override their mutual Coulomb attraction remains an open question.
Significant effort has been devoted to elucidating the origin of the efficient interfacial charge separation.20–37 For example, on the one hand, Tamura et al. found that charge delocalization could substantially reduce the e–h binding, and vibronically hot CT states could promote charge separation at the D/A interface.20 On the other hand, Savoie et al. revealed that the charge separation efficiency depended on the size, concentration and dimensionality of the acceptor, and was independent of exciton delocalization.21 In addition, Caruso and Troisi argued that excitons could dissociate tens of Angstroms away from the D/A interface and generate partially separated carriers, overriding their mutual attraction and forming free charges.25 Gélinas et al. showed that efficient charge separation could be realized via delocalized band-like states in fullerenes without the need of excess energy.32 Grancini et al. in contrast found that excess photon energy could be exploited to achieve higher charge separation efficiency owing to the resonant coupling between the nascent singlet exciton and hot interfacial states. Such states were more delocalized and thus more prone to charge separation instead of relaxation to the bound CT state.30 Falke et al. concluded that coherent vibronic coupling between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom was important to trigger charge delocalization and to promote the early stage charge-transfer across the D/A interface.37 Although there is no clear consensus, both ultrafast spectroscopic measurements33 and quantum chemical calculations20 seemed to suggest that charge delocalization of “hot” CT states could effectively reduce the Coulomb barrier and thus lead to efficient charge separation. Most interestingly, recent experimental evidence showed that efficient charge separation with >90% IQE could be achieved through the lowest-energy CT (CT1) state without the need for excess electronic or vibrational energy.13,34–36 To rationalize this observation, it was speculated that perhaps the CT1 state is only weakly bound,13 yielding efficient charge separation with >90% IQE. This speculation is of fundamental importance. If it is true, the focus of the ongoing research should be the design of D/A pairs in which the CT1 state is sufficiently delocalized for efficient charge separation. Conversely, if the speculation is false, the question turns to the physical origin of the localized CT1 state and in, particular, how the localized CT1 state could lead to efficient charge separation without the assistance of excess energy? These are crucial issues that have to be resolved for further development of OPVs. In this paper, we try to address these issues by combining quantum chemical calculations with kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) analysis. Using both model Hamiltonian and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations, we examine the nature of the CT1 state and establish conclusively that the CT1 state is localized in most OPVs with an electron–hole (e–h) distance much less than 40 Å. Since there is only one geminate recombination pathway for the CT1 state, we can determine its rate from ab initio non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations. The coherent vibronic coupling between the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom is included in NAMD simulations and the phonon modes responsible for the charge recombination of the CT1 state are identified. Finally, we perform KMC simulations to explore the charge separation mechanism of the CT1 state using well-defined material parameters determined from first principles or experiments. We find that under appropriate conditions, the CT1 state could indeed yield efficient charge separation driven by dynamic disorder and entropy contribution. Successful charge separation proceeds by carriers exploring lattice sites parallel to the interface, and thereby lowers the free energy by increasing the configuration entropy without increasing the enthalpy substantially.
2. Computational models and methods
To facilitate first-principles simulations, we construct D/A models based on an idealized P3HT/PCBM interface where C60 molecules are used to represent the acceptor (PCBM) and oligothiophene molecules are used to represent the donor (P3HT). This is a common practice in quantum chemical calculations of D/A interfaces.20,25,38 The initial intermolecular distance between adjacent C60 molecules is chosen according to the experimental C60 crystal structure.39 The initial packing structure of oligothiophenes is determined from the crystalline structure of P3HT.40 Based on the initial structure of the donor and acceptor, the D/A interfacial structure is optimized using the Vienna ab initio simulation package41 employing projector-augmented-wave pseudopotentials42 and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.43 The semi-empirical DFT-D2 functional44 is also employed to account for the van der Waals correction in this work. The gamma k point is sampled with an energy cutoff of 400 eV in all calculations. The optimized distance between the adjacent C60 molecules is ∼10 Å, similar to the corresponding experimental value.39 The optimized distance between the adjacent thiophene chains is 3.8 Å with a shift of 1/2 thiophene ring along the backbone direction, which is also similar to the experimental structure for P3HT.40 The energy and charge density of singlet CT excitons are calculated based on TDDFT45–48 using a range-separated hybrid functional.49,50 The theoretical foundation of the computational methods used in this work can be found in ref. 47 and 51. The range-separation parameter is set to 0.2 Bohr−1, which has been optimally tuned for similar interfaces51 and is close to the value used by others.20Ab initio Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations are carried out for the D/A interface by increasing the temperature to 300 K with repeated velocity scaling. The D/A interface is then kept at 300 K for 1000 fs to reach thermal equilibrium. Finally, a micro-canonical BOMD production run is performed for 1000 fs with a time-step of 1 fs. At each BOMD step, the excitation energy and charge density are calculated using the ranged-separated TDDFT method.47,51Ab initio NAMD52,53 using a modified fewest-switches-surface-hopping method54 is performed to simulate the geminate recombination of the CT1 state. A similar approach has been successfully used for charge transfer and recombination dynamics in organic/inorganic hybrid solar cells55,56 and dye-sensitized solar cells.57 The e–h recombination rate is estimated by averaging 105 NAMD trajectories, each of which is 500 fs long. In the range-separated hybrid functional TDDFT calculations, the long-range Hartree–Fock exchange in the hybrid functional is divided by the dielectric constant ε.
To model the charge separation of the localized CT1 state, we perform KMC simulations on a simple cubic lattice of the bilayer D/A interface shown in Fig. 1; the lattice constant (C) is 10 Å for both the donor and acceptor phases. The dimension of the donor and acceptor domains is given by the number of lattice sites or molecules in the direction. Energetic disorder for the donor (σD) and the acceptor (σA) is taken into account by assigning an individual energy to each lattice site in the donor and acceptor phase, respectively. The energy is chosen randomly from a Gaussian distribution of density of states whose width represents the degree of energetic disorder for the donor and acceptor. A tightly bound CT1 exciton is placed at the D/A interface, and the electron and hole can hop from a lattice site i to its nearest neighbor site j at a hopping rate determined by the semi-classical Marcus equation58 (1)Only the nearest neighbor hopping is considered which is the norm of this type of KMC simulations.23,59–61 Here, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature and ℏ = h/2π with h being the Planck constant. λ is the reorganization energy of the molecule and V is the electronic coupling between the adjacent molecules. Ei includes the random on-site energy and the potential energy at the site i. The potential energy is calculated from the Coulomb energy between the electron and hole, scaled by the effective dielectric constant ε. In addition to the hopping processes of the electron and hole, the carriers can also recombine in the KMC simulations and the recombination rate is the reciprocal of the recombination time (τR), which is calculated quantum mechanically. Although the internal electric field can reach 107 V m−1 under the short-circuit conditions, it does not dominate the overall charge separation process for high-performing OPV devices.22 In fact, >90% IQE observed in these high-performing OPVs is typically field-independent.7,18,62–65 Therefore, we do not include the electric field in the KMC calculations and instead focus on other relevant factors. We should point out, however, that the applied field could be important in low-performing OPV devices. On the basis of the charge hopping rate from eqn (1), the hopping probability pi along a pathway i is determined as pi = ki·Δt, where the time step for each hop Δt is 1 fs. The recombination probability p0 is determined by Δt/τR. For each move, a random number r between 0 and 1 is generated. If r < p0, the recombination occurs; if , the carrier is allowed to hop along the trajectory m; otherwise, both the recombination and the hop are disallowed. One KMC trajectory is completed when the e–h binding energy is less than the thermal energy at 300 K. 104 KMC trajectories are averaged to achieve reliable statistics of the results. The charge separation is deemed successful if the Coulomb potential energy between the carriers is below the thermal energy. The overall charge separation efficiency (η) is computed from the ratio of the successful trajectories over the entire set of trajectories.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Nature of charge-transfer states
To understand the nature of the CT1 state, we first compare the charge density of the lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) between the pure acceptor represented by a one-dimensional (1D) C60 array and an oligothiophene/C60 interface, both determined from the ground state DFT calculations. As shown in Fig. 2a, the LUMO charge density of the pure acceptor is essentially uniform with the exception of two ends, owing to the degenerate LUMO states contributed by each C60 molecule. Other unoccupied orbitals exhibit a similar uniform and delocalized electron distribution as the LUMO. However, once the D/A interface is formed, the LUMO charge density changes drastically and becomes localized at the interface, as shown in Fig. 2b. The van der Waals interaction between oligothiophene and C60 breaks the degeneracy, leading to localized LUMO charge density. We next calculate the charge density of the CT1 exciton using TDDFT and find that the CT1 state is also localized at the interface as displayed in Fig. 2c, very much like the LUMO charge density. Therefore, the localized electron distribution of the CT1 state originates from the localized LUMO state, which in turn stems from the broken translational symmetry of the D/A interface. An exactly same correlation is also found between the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and the hole of the CT1 state.

As shown in Fig. 3a, the HOMO charge density is uniform and delocalized across the thiophene chains (except for the two ends). When the D/A interface is formed, the HOMO state becomes localized at the interface (Fig. 3b), which leads to localized hole charge density of the CT1 state as displayed in Fig. 3c. For this D/A interface, the e–h distance of the CT1 state is 12 Å. We also study two other D/A interfaces with different donors, pentacene and dianthra[2,3-b:2′,3′-f]-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DATT). The experimental crystal parameters for pentacene66 and DATT67 are used in the calculations. We observe the same correlation for these two interfaces. In particular, the CT1 state in both systems is localized at the interface as displayed in Fig. 4, indicating the generality of the observation. In particular, the e–h distance of the CT1 state at pentacene/C60 and DATT/C60 interfaces is 12 Å and 11 Å, respectively. Although these are state-of-the-art calculations, the results can only provide qualitative features of the CT states, owing to oversimplified 1D model employed therein. The polarization due to the molecular environment and the delocalization of electron and hole wave-functions are not fully taken into consideration,68 hence quantitative results such as e–h distances may not be accurate.

To place our finding on a more quantitative and firmer ground, we examine the following tight-binding Hamiltonian which captures the polarization effect through an effective dielectric constant and the delocalization of the electron and hole wave-functions by modeling semi-infinite donor and acceptor domains: (2) The hole (or electron) hops between the nearest-neighbor donor (or acceptor) lattice sites labeled by the index i (or j), counting from the interface. For example, i = 1 (or j = 1) indicates the first polymer chain (or fullerene molecule) from the D/A interface, as shown schematically in Fig. 5a. The first term represents the e–h Coulomb attraction with an effective dielectric constant (ε = 4). The inter-chain distance in the donor is CD (=3.8 Å) while the intermolecular distance between the fullerenes is CA (=10 Å); F is the interfacial separation distance between the nearest-neighbor donor and acceptor molecules. The second term represents the nearest-neighbor coupling in the donor and acceptor phases with the coupling constant given by VD and VA, respectively. In a functional D/A heterojunction, the value of F ranges between 6.5 Å and 9.5 Å.69 If F is greater than 9.5 Å, the electronic coupling or wave-function overlap between the donor and acceptor is vanishingly small, and so is the oscillator strength of the CT states. Therefore, the CT states would have very low probabilities to be formed at such heterojunctions. In the following analysis, we hence consider two F values, F = 6.5 Å and 9.5 Å. For each F, we solve the eigenvalue equation of the Hamiltonian and identify the CT1 state. The wave-function of the CT1 state is then used to determine the e–h distance. In Fig. 5b and c, we plot the e–h distance of the CT1 state as a function of the electronic couplings. Since electronic coupling in typical organic materials is between a few meV to 200 meV,70 the results are displayed in this energy range. As expected, the e–h distance increases with the electronic coupling. More importantly, the e–h distance of the CT1 state is generally much lower than 40 Å. At this distance, the residual Coulomb attraction between the charges is at or below the thermal energy, so that the electron and hole can separate freely.22,32 Therefore, we have shown that on a general ground the CT1 state is indeed localized. Interestingly, the localization of the CT1 state depends sensitively on the nearest neighbor D/A distance F. Between F = 6.5 and 9.5 Å, the e–h distance of the CT1 state for the same set of VA and VD can vary ∼10 Å, tripling the difference between F themselves. These results highlight the importance of molecular packing at the interface. As shown later, the variation in the e–h distance could lead to a drastic effect on charge separation efficiency. The ensuing question is how such a localized CT1 state could yield greater than 90% charge separation efficiency.

3.2 Exciton recombination at the D/A interface
In the following section, we examine the recombination of the CT1 state at 300 K performing ab initio NAMD simulations using a modified fewest-switches-surface-hopping method. The computational methodology and its applications to exciton dynamics can be found elsewhere.55–57 To provide insight into exciton dynamics, the simulations must be capable of describing excited states over a timescale of hundreds of femtoseconds. However, the computational requirement of such combined electronic and ionic dynamics is very demanding. In particular, not one MD trajectory, but an ensemble of hundreds of trajectories has to be taken into consideration. Therefore, approximations are necessary to make the problem tractable. Here, we study two simplified interfacial models as shown in Fig. 5a, the first model with one donor molecule and one acceptor molecule (N = M = 1) and the second model with three donor molecules and one acceptor molecule (N = 3 and M = 1). We also examine a case with N = 1 and M = 4, and find that the number of the acceptor molecules has little influence on the recombination dynamics as shown in the inset of Fig. 6a, owing to the localized nature of the CT1 state as evidenced in Fig. 3c. Hence, M = 1 is sufficient for simulating the recombination dynamics. Moreover, the minimal interfacial model with N = M = 1 has also been used by others.69,71 In the NAMD simulations, the excitonic wave-function starts with 100% population of the CT1 state. The wave-function is subsequently propagated in time based on the fewest-switches-surface-hopping method. We find that the CT1 state gradually decays to the ground state (i.e., recombination) with the ground state population increasing steadily in time, as displayed in Fig. 6a. For the first interface model (M = N = 1), we estimate the recombination time τR as ∼0.5 ns by extrapolating the time to achieve 100% population of the ground state. For the second interface model (N = 3 and M = 1), because the hole is slightly removed from the interface compared to the first model, the recombination time τR is ∼0.8 ns. The CT1 recombination lifetime obtained from the present simulations is similar to what has been known (∼3 ns) from experiments72–74 and from other theoretical calculations.69,71 To gain more insight into the recombination, we Fourier-transform the energy level of the CT1 state from the time domain to the frequency domain, and the results are shown in Fig. 6b. The peak of the energy spectrum corresponds to the vibrational frequency of the donor and acceptor that couples most strongly to the CT1 recombination dynamics. In particular, we find that the rotation of C60 molecules, the stretching of C–S bonds in the thiophene chain, and the stretching of CC bonds in both C60 and thiophene, are the most important phonon modes that give rise to CT1 recombination.

The black and red solid curves correspond to the D/A interface with M = N = 1 and M = 1 and N = 3, respectively. The dashed curves are the linear fit of the solid ones. The blue curve in the inset corresponds to the D/A interface with M = 4 and N = 1. (b) The Fourier transform of the CT1 energy level at 300 K for the D/A interface with M = N = 1. Peaks (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) correspond to the phonon mode of C60 rotation, the stretching of C–S bonds in the donor, the stretching of CC bonds in the acceptor, and the stretching of CC bonds in the donor, respectively. 
3.3 KMC simulations of charge separation efficiency
Next, we carry out KMC simulations to examine the charge separation of the localized CT1 state at 300 K. In contrast to previous KMC studies, the present work can account for >90% and field-independent IQE for the CT1 state without assuming its lifetime (τR) that is orders of magnitude longer than experimentally reported values (1–10 ns). As emphasized by Burke and McGehee,24 if the material parameters entering the KMC simulations are not chosen judiciously, opposite conclusions would be arrived from KMC simulations. In particular, they showed that the bulk mobility values used in previous KMC simulations substantially underestimated charge separation efficiency. They proposed that the short-range mobilities as probed by time resolved terahertz conductivity should be used instead because they reflect more accurately the intrinsic hopping rates as used in KMC simulations. In particular, they demonstrated that the charge separation efficiency depends only on the product of carrier local mobility (μ) and CT exciton lifetime (τR). In our KMC modeling, each materials parameter entering the KMC simulations has a clear microscopic physical meaning. More specifically, the reorganization energy (λD and λA), electronic coupling (VD and VA) and energetic disorder (σD and σA) of the donor and acceptor are well-defined physical quantities that can be in principle determined from quantum chemical calculations. In Table 1, we list the parameters used in the KMC calculations and the references from which these numbers are obtained. The electronic coupling for the donor is calculated using eqn (1) from the pre-exponential factor and reorganization energy used in ref. 75. Although energetic disorder of the acceptor (PCBM) has been measured experimentally77 and also computed from first principles78 as 70 meV, we actually tune its value from 10 to 70 meV in the KMC calculations to examine how η may depend on this parameter. The initial e–h distance (d) and lifetime (τR) of the CT1 state are determined from first principles and have been described elsewhere in the paper. The lower value of the lifetime, 0.5 ns, is used in KMC calculations to provide a lower bound of charge separation efficiency.

The dimensions of the donor or acceptor domains are varied in the KMC simulations to explore the dependence of charge separation efficiency on the morphology. In Fig. 7a, we show η as a function of L for various σA values. In this case, the number of donor and acceptor molecules in x, y and z directions is L, L and 40, respectively. First of all, we find that for a given energetic disorder, η increases monotonically with L and saturates at L > 30. A similar trend is also observed in Fig. 7b. The positive correlation between the dimensions and η may be attributed to the configuration entropy contribution. The larger the dimensions, the more accessible lattice sites for the carriers to hop to; thus higher the configuration entropy, the lower the free energy. This general trend is expected to be valid if the KMC lattice is no longer rigid or the second (or higher) nearest neighbor hopping is allowed. Beyond certain critical dimensions, which depend on the intrinsic mobility of the carriers, η is leveled off.

The diffusion distance for the hole (c) and electron (d) along x, y and z axes averaged over all KMC trajectories with σA = 10 meV, an initial e–h distance of 12 Å, L = 41 and M = 40. The diffusion distance for the hole (e) and electron (f) along x, y and z axes averaged over all KMC trajectories with σA = 70 meV, an initial e–h distance of 12 Å, L = 41 and M = 40. 
Secondly, the energetic disorder is found to play a crucial role in charge separation; the stronger the energetic disorder, the higher the charge separation efficiency. In particular, for a weak energetic disorder such as σA = 10 meV, the maximum efficiency is below 60% regardless of the dimensions of the donor and acceptor domains. Because the configuration entropy depends logarithmically on the number of available lattice sites or dimensions, it cannot outcompete the energetic contribution. Although energetic disorder has been found to promote charge separation in previous KMC simulations,59,79,80 its role in charge separation is somewhat ambiguous. For example, it is well known that the reduced energetic disorder would increase carrier mobility, which in turn assists charge separation.24 This, however, contradicts the KMC results that increased energetic disorder actually enhances charge separation. We can reconcile this contradiction by distinguishing the nature of energetic disorder (dynamic vs. static) in charge transport and separation. As discussed succinctly by Tummala et al.,78 dynamic disorder originates from electron–phonon coupling while static disorder results from material defects and the loss of translational symmetry. In a perfect crystal without any chemical and physical defects, dynamic disorder is the only type of disorder present. Static disorder is always detrimental for charge transport while dynamics disorder may in some instances enhance carrier mobility via a phonon-assisted charge transport. When one talks about the fact that reduced energy disorder increases mobility, one actually refers to static disorder primarily. In particular, for PC61BM and PC71BM acceptors employed in high-performing OPVs, quantum chemical calculations have shown that static disorder is about twice as large as dynamic disorder. More importantly, static disorder tends to either localize the electronic wave-functions (i.e., Anderson localization) or trap the carriers, both of which are detrimental to charge transport. Therefore, the stronger the static disorder, the lower the carrier mobility. However, in the present and previous KMC calculations, static disorder has been ignored because both the underlying lattice and intrinsic hopping rates remain fixed in the simulations, and no localization of wave-functions has been considered explicitly. Hence, the enhanced charge separation observed in KMC simulations is attributed exclusively to dynamic disorder, which supplies the energetic driving force or equivalently, lower-energy hopping sites for the carriers. Thus the stronger the dynamic disorder, the higher the charge separation efficiency. We wish to point out the main differences in KMC simulations of carrier mobility and charge separation. For carrier mobility, a collection of carriers (either electrons or holes) is modeled with an equilibrium carrier concentration, and the system is assumed to be in equilibrium. For charge separation, on the other hand, only two carriers (one electron and one hole) are modeled and the system is not in equilibrium. Thirdly, for a 1D D/A interface (L = 1), η is always lower than 60% irrespective of σA. Thus it is impossible to achieve an efficient charge separation at a 1D D/A interface for the CT1 state regardless of the dynamic disorder. For a low σA, some 1D interfaces have a vanishing η. These results lend strong support to the previous work by Clarke and Durrant7 and by Gregg81 on the importance of entropy and dimensionality (3D vs. 1D) in charge separation. Lastly, for a reasonable σA (> 40 meV), η can reach 90% for L > 30. In particular, for σA = 70 meV, which has been measured experimentally77 and calculated from first principles,78η is >90% for L = 15. This is the first important result of the present KMC calculations, establishing that >90% separation efficiency of the CT1 state is indeed achievable with a reasonable combination of dynamic disorder and domain size. For other donor/PCBM interfaces, η could be even higher than the lower limit obtained here.
In Fig. 7b, we examine the dependence of η on M. If L is large enough (L = 41), we find that η is practically independent of M with the exception of weak dynamic disorder (σA < 40 meV). This suggests that the dimension(s) of the donor and acceptor domains along the interface plays a more important role than those normal to the interface. This observation again stems from the configuration entropy contribution. If the crystallinity along the interface is high, there are many accessible sites along the interface for the carrier to explore, which increases the entropy without changing the enthalpy much. As a result, the free energy is reduced for charge separation. To see this phenomenon more clearly, we show in Fig. 7c–f the carrier hopping distance as a function of the simulation time with L = 41 and M = 40. We find that both carriers prefer hopping in x and y directions to the z direction irrespective of dynamic disorder. This is the second important result, highlighting the importance of the crystallinity along the D/A interface for charge separation. Once again, η can exceed 90% as long as σA > 40 meV and M > 10 (L = 41). Therefore, we conclude that the CT1 state could lead to >90% charge separation efficiency without the assumption that it is only weakly bound in these materials.13 Since the CT1 state by itself can already yield efficient charge separation, “hot” CT dissociation is not necessary and IQE would appear to be independent of the excitation energy in these materials.13,34 Furthermore, no internal electric field is required to achieve such high efficiency.
For a small e–h distance (<2.5 nm), as shown in Fig. 7, one can fit the average diffusion distance 2 as a function of time t (t < 10 ps), from which the local carrier mobility can be extracted via Einstein relation μ = eD/kBT with D = 2/t. In Table 2, we list the electron and hole mobility for dynamic disorder σA = 10 and 70 meV, respectively. Unlike the previous work,24 we do not assume that the electron and hole have the same local mobility. On the contrary, we find that the electron mobility is 3–5 orders of magnitude higher than the hole mobility, owing to a much smaller reorganization energy of the acceptor. In general, the range of the electron and hole mobility matches the one observed in experiments. For example, the electron mobility in PCBM has been measured in the range between 2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 from impedance spectroscopy measurements82 and 2 cm2 V−1 s−1 from field-effect transistor measurements.83,84 The hole mobility in regio-irregular P3HT at 300 K has been experimentally measured as 2.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1,85 and the first-principles simulations have predicted a value of 2.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1.86 We find that the stronger the energetic disorder, the higher the electron mobility, which is consistent with the fact that dynamic disorder is considered in the KMC simulations.

Fig. 8 shows η as a function of L for different initial e–h distances. For a weak dynamic disorder with σA = 10 meV, the initial e–h distance could yield one order of magnitude difference in η. Thus a minor difference in the interfacial separation distance F would lead to a significant difference in the initial e–h distance, which in turn results in a drastic difference in η. However, for a strong dynamic disorder σA = 70 meV, η can reach >90% irrespective of the initial e–h distances considered here.

To shed light on charge separation, we extract the free energy distributions from the KMC trajectories for both carriers. According to eqn (1), the free energy barrier for the carrier dynamics is the sum of λ and ΔG(=Ef − Ei), and the electron and hole have to overcome this barrier to be separated. The different dynamics that the electron and hole exhibit in the KMC simulations reflects the distinct free energy barriers they encounter. For the hole, whose free energy probability distribution is shown in Fig. 9a, the most probable free energy barrier is between 750 and 850 meV, depending on dynamic disorder. This free energy barrier is much higher than the thermal energy at 300 K, hence, the hole can hardly escape from the Columbic binding, and its local mobility is very low. The dynamic disorder could lower the free energy barrier by ∼100 meV between the two σA values considered here, and thus promote charge separation. For the electron, whose free energy probability distribution is shown in Fig. 9b, however, the most probable free energy barrier is between 150 and 300 meV. This free energy barrier is comparable to or even smaller than the thermal energy. Therefore, the electron can escape from the Coulomb attraction assisted by dynamic disorder or lattice vibrations. The much smaller free energy barrier of the electron is again attributed to the smaller reorganization energy of the acceptor. We thus conclude that the reorganization energy of the organic materials is the single most important parameter in terms of charge separation. This is not surprising since the reorganization energy is known to play a crucial role in charge transport.87 In particular, designing donor materials with a lower reorganization energy should be actively pursued in the future.

(b) Probability distribution of the free energy barrier for the electron during the KMC simulations. The black and red curves represent the probability distribution in the presence of dynamic disorder with σA = 10 and 70 meV, respectively. These results are obtained based on the D/A interface with L = 11, M = 40 and an initial e–h initial distance d = 12 Å. 
4. Conclusions
On the basis of the first-principles simulations, we have examined the nature of the lowest-energy charge-transfer state, or CT1 state, in organic D/A heterojunctions. We have resolved the critical issue of whether the CT1 state is always localized in organic heterojunctions and the key material parameters that control the localization of the CT1 state. Based on a general analysis, we predict that the CT1 state is always localized in OPVs with its e–h distance much smaller than 40 Å. The electronic couplings in and between the donor and acceptor phases determine the localization of the CT1 state. Molecular packing at the interface also plays an important role in the localization of the CT1 state. We have examined the geminate recombination of the CT1 state and estimated its lifetime from first principles. The vibrational modes contributing to the geminate recombination are identified. Using material parameters determined from first principles or experiments as an input, we have carried out KMC simulations to examine the interfacial charge separation. For a localized CT1 state, we find that efficient charge separation with IQE >90% is indeed achievable using realistic materials parameters. Dynamic disorder and configuration entropy are found to be particularly important for charge separation. The former originates from the molecular vibrations and provides the energetic driving force for charge separation, while the latter relies on the dimensions of donor and acceptor domains and provides the entropic driving force. The charge separation efficiency depends more sensitively on the acceptor dimension parallel to the interface than that normal to the interface. The electron and hole mobilities extracted from the KMC trajectories are consistent with experimental values. The electron mobility is 3–5 orders of magnitude higher than the hole mobility thanks to the lower reorganization energy of the acceptor. We propose that future material development should focus on designing donor materials with lower reorganization energies.

The black and red solid curves correspond to the D/A interface with M = N = 1 and M = 1 and N = 3, respectively. The dashed curves are the linear fit of the solid ones. The blue curve in the inset corresponds to the D/A interface with M = 4 and N = 1. (b) The Fourier transform of the CT1 energy level at 300 K for the D/A interface with M = N = 1. Peaks (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) correspond to the phonon mode of C60 rotation, the stretching of C–S bonds in the donor, the stretching of CC bonds in the acceptor, and the stretching of CC bonds in the donor, respectively.

 	Fig. 8  Charge separation efficiency, η, as a function of L with M = 40 for σA = 10 meV (a) and σA = 70 meV (b). The black, red and blue curves correspond to the initial e–h distances of 10, 12 and 15 Å, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 9  (a) Probability distribution of the free energy barrier for the hole during the KMC simulations. (b) Probability distribution of the free energy barrier for the electron during the KMC simulations. The black and red curves represent the probability distribution in the presence of dynamic disorder with σA = 10 and 70 meV, respectively. These results are obtained based on the D/A interface with L = 11, M = 40 and an initial e–h initial distance d = 12 Å.
