    , Accepted 24th February 2018First published on 27th February 2018AbstractHerein, a novel Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 hybrid nanocomposite was successfully synthesized by a two-step strategy of one-pot pyrolysis followed by the impregnation method. The structure, phase, morphology and electronic environment of MoO3, g-C3N4 and Cu in the composite were determined by various characterization methods. The oxygen vacancies of MoO3 were ascertained by UV-DRS, Raman, and XPS analysis. The formation of the heterostructure was characterised by electrochemical measurements. The photocatalytic performance of the composite was investigated by the water reduction reaction and the reduction of an important inorganic pollutant, Cr(VI). In the presence of Cu NPs, the H2 evolution of the MoO3/g-C3N4 hybrid was found to be 652 μmol h−1 with an apparent energy conversion efficiency of 13.46%, and up to 95% of Cr(VI) was reduced using citric acid as a hole scavenger. The remarkably enhanced photocatalytic performance was attributed to the combined effect of the double Z-scheme mechanism and defective MoO3. The in situ formation process of the MoO3/g-C3N4 hybrid followed a direct Z-scheme charge transfer by generating a great number of defects at the solid–solid interface, similar to that of a conductor, and offered low electrical resistance, whereas loading of Cu NPs built up an indirect Z-scheme charge transfer to establish the double Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism. This hybrid material produces a photocurrent density of 12.1 mA cm−2, in good agreement with the photocatalytic activity. This study highlights the facilitation effect of MoO3 due to oxygen vacancies and charge transfer through the double Z-scheme mechanism to open up a new window in the field of 2D nanostructured photocatalytic materials.
1. Introduction
In recent years, significant research attention has been focused on the development of photocatalytic technology using solar energy for environmental remediation, and the selection of catalysts is the core of this technology.1–4 To address the environmental problems and today's energy crisis, graphitic carbon nitride is a relatively novel, versatile and promising photo catalyst. This metal-free polymeric semiconducting material has significant potential to catalyze water splitting reactions, the reduction of carbon dioxide, and the degradation of pollutants under visible light irradiation. However, its low solar energy conversion efficiency restricts its wide practical applications. Therefore, it is highly crucial and a great challenge to explore strategies to improve its performance. Several attempts have been made to optimize the material by morphological modulation, coupling with other semiconducting materials, doping with non-metals, loading metals as co-catalysts, constructing hetero junctions, etc.4–7 In particular, the fabrication of hetero-structured nano-composites of g-C3N4 by combining it with other suitable semiconducting materials endows the composites with novel characteristics and also improves their efficiency due to synergistic effects.
Recently, molybdenum trioxide has emerged as an effective semiconducting material with broad application prospects owing to the stability of the orthogonal crystal structure, surface effects, special quantum size effect, and its electrochromic and photochromic sensitive nature.8,9 However, it is challenging for MoO3 with oxygen vacancies to find applications in various electrochromic processes ranging from electronics to energy storage. To take advantage of oxygen vacancies, efforts have been made by various research groups to generate intermediate gap states in wide band gap semiconducting materials to improve their photocatalytic efficiency.10 In MoO3, the 4d state of Mo acts as the conduction band minimum and the 2p state of oxygen acts as the valence band maximum. Shifting electrons from the oxygen vacancies to the 4d states of Mo reduces the crystal field sufficiently and results in the formation of extended 4d gap states. For generating intermediate gap states, the creation of oxygen vacancies in a metal oxide network in a reducing environment is effective; therefore, to take better advantage of the material and to improve its photocatalytic efficiency, efforts have been devoted to exploring visible light-induced hybrid photocatalysts by introducing modifications. In the past several years, a few g-C3N4 hybridized MoO3 composites have been reported in the field of photocatalysis. Huang et al. fabricated the g-C3N4/MoO3 composite by calcining a mixture of g-C3N4 and MoO3, showing high efficiency for the degradation of MB.11 He et al. designed a novel Z-scheme type g-C3N4/MoO3 composite by a similar mixture calcination method to study the degradation of MO.12 However, no studies have been reported on the water reduction reaction for the generation of H2 energy and for the reduction of an important inorganic pollutant like hexavalent chromium. Considering the above, herein we have designed a composite material of MoO3/g-C3N4 by an in situ calcination method, where g-C3N4 plays the role of a reducing agent to create oxygen vacancies as well as help in charge separation in the hybrid nanocomposite by a mediator-free double Z-scheme mechanism. We have tried to improve the efficiency of the composite by loading it with Cu NPs, owing to their good thermal, optical, electrical and cost effectiveness compared to other noble metal nanoparticles. Moreover, its plasmon surface resonance exhibits nonlinear optical properties, which extend its applications in various fields.
Although it is difficult to measure the oxygen vacancy in defective MoO3, with the help of some indirect characterization techniques such as Raman spectra, UV-DRS and XPS, we have explained the presence of oxygen vacancies in the synthesized hybrid photocatalyst. Oxygen vacancies obtained by creating donor states and by the Z-scheme mechanism strongly affect the light absorption and charge separation, thus endowing the composite material with strong capacity for the reduction of hexavalent chromium and the water reduction reaction for the generation of hydrogen under visible light.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All the materials such as ammonium molybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O), thiourea, CuSO4·5H2O, diphenyl carbazide, methanol and citric acid were purchased from Merck and were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Distilled water was used throughout the synthesis procedure.
2.2. Preparation of photocatalyst
The nano-composite was prepared by an in situ calcination method. Ammonium molybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) and thiourea were used as the sources for MoO3 and g-C3N4, respectively. Each was taken separately in a 100 mL beaker with 30 mL deionized water, and sonicated for 15 min. The solutions were then mixed, placed in an alumina crucible and calcined at 550 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace at a heating rate of 5 °C per minute. After being cooled, the solid product was ground to fine powder. Following the same synthesis procedure, different weight percentages of MoO3/g-C3N4 composites were prepared by varying the wt% of thiourea, maintaining the wt ratio of 1:2, 1:4, 1:6 and 1:8. After studying the activity of the as synthesised catalysts, Cu NPs were incorporated through the impregnation method on the highest active (1:4) catalyst by using CuSO4·5H2O solution. In 40 mL of DI water, 1 g of 1:4 g-C3N4/MoO3 composite was dispersed and stirred for 1 h and then CuSO4·5H2O solution was added in a drop-wise manner with constant stirring for proper mixing. It was then evaporated to a pasty mass and dried in the oven at 80 °C overnight. With different wt% (2%, 4%, 6% and 8%), Cu NPs incorporated samples were prepared. For a comparison study, pure g-C3N4 and pure MoO3 were also prepared using the same calcination method.
We used the one-pot calcination method for the formation of MoO3/g-C3N4 composites, in order to enhance the interaction between MoO3 and g-C3N4 and to modify the textural structures of the resulting composite material. In the composite formation process, the mechanism during calcination involves the liberation of volatile materials, water and ammonia, resulting in the formation of defective MoO3 samples at high temperature, which are represented by this sequence of eqn ((1)–(4)); fabrication of the composite material is shown in Scheme 1. (1) (2) (3) (4)

2.3. Characterization technique
The X-ray diffraction patterns of the synthesised composites were obtained on a Rigaku Miniflex instrument (set at 30 kV and 15 mA) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) to determine the crystallinity and phase purity. The UV-Vis absorptions of all the prepared samples were measured on a JASCO 750 UV-Vis spectrophotometer, using BaSO4 as the reference. The PL emission and excitation spectra were analyzed by using a JASCO-FP-8300 fluorescence spectrometer in which a xenon lamp was used as the excitation source. The morphology, interaction between MoO3 and g-C3N4 and the microstructure of the catalysts were investigated using a TEM-JEOL-2010- 200 kV instrument, and lattice fringe measurements were carried out using a high resolution transmission electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was investigated with a VG Microtech Multilab ESCA 3000 surface analysis system using a non-monochromatised Mg Kα X-ray source. The shift in binding energy due to surface charging was calibrated by using the C 1s level at 284.6 eV as an internal standard. FTIR spectra of the samples were obtained by using a PerkinElmer spectrum RXI FT-IR spectrophotometer in the frequency range of 2500–400 cm−1 and KBr as the reference diluent. The BET specific surface areas of the samples were analyzed via a nitrogen adsorption–desorption method by using an automated surface area and porosity analyser (NOVA 2200e, Quantachrome) at liquid nitrogen temperature. SEM images were obtained using a Hitachi S-3400N. Prior to the analyses, the samples were sputtered with a thin film of gold. The powder particles were supported on a carbon film coated on a 3 mm diameter fine-mesh copper grid. Raman spectra of the synthesised photocatalysts were obtained by using a Seki STR 500 Raman spectrophotometer excited at a wave length of 532 nm. The electrochemical studies (LSV and MS) of the prepared samples were carried out using a multi-channel Ivium potentiostat. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurement was carried out in a Pyrex electrochemical cell by using the sample as the working electrode, platinum as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. Na2SO4 (0.5 M, pH 6.3) was used as the electrolyte solution for the electrochemical study.
2.4. Photocatalytic experiment
The visible light induced photocatalytic activities of all the prepared catalysts were studied by the water reduction reaction to evaluate the hydrogen evolved and the degradation of the inorganic pollutant hexavalent chromium. The amount of hydrogen produced with time and the stability of the photocatalyst were evaluated by performing reusability tests. The degradation activity of the catalysts was investigated at different pH values and with time under visible light irradiation to compare the activity of the various composites.

2.4.1 Experiment for the water reduction reaction. 
Photocatalytic water reduction reactions of all the neat and composite materials were performed using a Pyrex glass reactor fitted with a closed gas-circulation system. In a reactor, 0.02 g of the catalyst was suspended in 20 mL of aqueous methanol solution (10%) as a hole scavenger. The solution was constantly stirred using a magnetic stirrer to prevent settlement of the nanoparticles. For the photocatalytic reaction, a 150 W xenon arc lamp was used as the light source (>400 nm) and 1 M NaNO2 solution as the UV filter. The reactor was purged with nitrogen gas for 15 minutes to create an inert atmosphere. The volume of hydrogen evolved was studied for 2 h. The evolved H2 gas was collected by the downward displacement of water and was analysed using GC. The photocatalytic water reduction experiment for each sample was carried out at least three times and the average value was taken. To optimize the conditions for H2 evolution, we carried out the water reduction reaction by using triethanol amine and lactic acid. The photocatalytic H2 evolution for each sample was repeated at least three times. The average incident radiation power on the photocatalyst and stored chemical energy for the Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 photocatalyst under the irradiation of visible light were calculated and found to be 150 mW and 20.23 mW, respectively. The apparent energy conversion efficiency of the photocatalyst was calculated by using the following equation:  


2.4.2 Experiment for Cr(VI) reduction. 
The photodegradation activity of the synthesised samples was analyzed by taking hexavalent chromium as the pollutant under visible light irradiation. All the experiments were carried out in the daytime between 10:00 am and 12:00 noon. The experimental set up included a magnetically stirred conical flask containing 20 mL of 50 ppm chromium(VI) solution along with 0.02 g of the catalyst maintained at pH = 3, which was found to be optimum for Cr(VI) reduction (among pH = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8). Before being exposed to sunlight, the solutions were stirred for 30 min in the dark to attain adsorption–desorption equilibrium. The samples were then kept under direct sunlight for 1 h to study the degradation activity. For analysis, the aliquots of the treated catalysts were centrifuged immediately to remove the catalysts. The percentage of degradation was determined by using UV-Vis spectroscopy.


2.4.3 Measurement of Cr(VI) concentration. 
For measuring the Cr(VI) concentration, 2 mL of the centrifuged Cr solution was mixed with 3 mol L−1 H2SO4 solution and taken in a 10 mL volumetric flask. The colour of the solution was developed by adding freshly prepared diphenylcarbazide (DPC) solution in acetone. After the addition of DPC, the mixture was allowed to stand for 15 minutes. Using all the solutions except Cr(VI), a blank reading was taken as a reference. During the photoreduction reaction, aliquots were sampled after 5, 10, 15, 30 and 45 minutes intervals for kinetics studies after centrifugation and filtration. From the absorbance intensity, which is directly proportional to the Cr concentration, the percentage of Cr reduction over the catalysts was measured in the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the Cr(VI)–diphenylcarbazide complex in the solution.

2.5 Electrochemical study
The electrochemical and photoelectrochemical performance of various samples were done on an electrochemical workstation Ivium potentiostat using a standard three electrode system and a 300 W Xe lamp as the light source. The as synthesized sample, used as the working electrode, was prepared by the electrophoretic deposition method using FTO. A Pt wire and Ag/AgCl were used as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. A 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution was used as the electrolyte throughout the analysis. The Mott-Schottky plot of the material was recorded at 1500 Hz under dark conditions. The polarisation curves (LSV) were produced by sweeping the potential from −1.5 to 0 V.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Study of crystal structure and morphology (XRD, SEM, TEM)

3.1.1 Powder X-ray diffraction studies. 
The crystal structure and phase of the Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 composite were revealed by the X-ray diffraction study. Fig. 1 represents the XRD patterns of the MoO3, g-C3N4, MoO3/g-C3N4 and Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 composite. In general, MoO3 exists in three different crystalline phases, namely, orthorhombic (α-MoO3), monoclinic (β-MoO3) and hexagonal (h-MoO3), in which each layer consists of two sub-layers of distorted octahedral units of MoO6, sharing the edge along the c-axis and a corner along the a-axis. These layers are held together in a staggered manner along the y-axis by weak van der Waals forces of attraction, out of which the orthorhombic phase is thermodynamically stable and consists of double layers of MoO6 octahedral units.10 These van der Waals gaps can be used for the intercalation of foreign atoms.13–15 Sharp, well-defined diffraction peaks indicate the crystallinity in the composite, which is the most important criterion for improved photocatalytic activity. MoO3 exhibits several strong diffraction peaks at 2θ = 12.78°, 23.3°, 25.7°, 27.3°, 33.7°, 39.0° and 46.12, which are indexed as the orthorhombic phase (JCPDS 35-0609) and correspond to the 020, 110, 040, 021, 111, 060 and 200 planes, respectively. It is concluded that the in situ formation process favours the growth of MoO3 in the orthorhombic phase, which is thermodynamically more stable than the monoclinic phase. The diffraction patterns for g-C3N4 should be at 2θ = 13.1° and 27.4°, corresponding to the 100 and 002 plane, respectively, in accordance with the interplanar stacking of aromatic system and the interlayer crystal structure.3,4 However, in the Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 composite, the diffraction patterns for g-C3N4 were not clearly observed as they overlap with the XRD patterns of MoO3. The inset XRD image reflects the two deconvulation peaks at 2θ = 27.3, clearly indicating the presence of both MoO3 and g-C3N4 in the composite. Upon loading the Cu NPs, the peak position of the MoO3/g-C3N4 composite remained almost unchanged, with only a slight decrease in the peak intensity being observed. No characteristic peaks of Cu NPs were detected, indicating well-dispersed Cu NPs at the nanometer scale and a smaller amount of Cu.16 The XRD patterns of the MoO3/g-C3N4 composite with different amounts of Cu (2%, 4%, 6% and 8%) were also analysed and provided in Fig. S1, (ESI†).

3.1.2 Transmission electron microscopic study. 
The morphology and microstructure of MoO3 and g-C3N4 in the composites were investigated by TEM measurements. From the figure, it can be seen that big black particles indicate the presence of MoO3 grains on the surface of g-C3N4. The presence of two different phases is clearly observed in close contact with each other, which is beneficial to the formation of a heterostructure. Unlike g-C3N4, the MoO3 sample was found to have a particle size of 200–600 nm, and a grain-like morphology with polygonal grain shapes. To confirm the formation of the heterostructure in the Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 composite, a HRTEM study was also carried out and presented in Fig. 2. From the HRTEM image, it was observed that the heterostructure of the Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 composite material exhibited lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.35 nm assigned to the (040) plane of MoO3, whereas another type of fringe with an interplanar distance of 0.25 nm was assigned to the (002) plane of CuO. From the TEM image, it can be seen that the strong interaction between MoO3 and g-C3N4 is beneficial for the improved electron channelization through the interface to show higher photocatalytic performance. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) data are shown in Fig. S2, (ESI†).

3.1.3 Scanning electron microscopic study. 
The surface topography and the elemental composition of the prepared photocatalysts were investigated by SEM. From the SEM images, it was revealed that the MoO3 crystals exist in an irregular polygonal morphology (Fig. 3a), whereas a typical slate-like, stacked lamellar structure was formed in the case of neat g-C3N4 (Fig. 3b). However, in the case of the MoO3/g-C3N4 composite, the lamellar structure decomposed to form clusters of condensed triazine-rings, yielding irregular polygonal crystal morphologies. A mixed morphology can be observed in the SEM micrographs of the heterojunction nanocomposite material. The SEM image also indicates that during mixing and heat treatment, the g-C3N4 and MoO3 phases mixed to form an agglomerated morphology.

3.2 Analysis of chemical groups, chemical states, and surface defects (FTIR, XPS, and Raman)

3.2.1 FTIR study. 

Fig. 4 represents the FTIR signals of the Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 nanocomposite. The hybrid nanocomposite shows the signals corresponding to MoO3 and g-C3N4. Upon addition of g-C3N4, signals due to g-C3N4 were clearly observed in the MoO3/g-C3N4 and Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 nanohybrid system. Neat g-C3N4 showed signals in the range of 1200–1600 cm−1, which were assigned to the CN and C–N stretching vibrational modes in the aromatic system. In addition, a signal at 808 cm−1 represents the out-of plane bending vibrational modes of the C–N heterocycle.3,4 In the case of pure MoO3, three strong IR signals were observed. The signal at 1000 cm−1 was due to the MoO stretching mode, while the signals at 562 cm−1 and 859 cm−1 were due to the stretching vibrational modes of oxygen linked to three metal atoms and Mo–O–Mo units, respectively, with a specification of layered orthorhombic MoO3.11,12 In the MoO3/g-C3N4 and Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 nanohybrid system, the characteristic vibrational modes of MoO3 and g-C3N4 represent the co-existence of g-C3N4 and MoO3 in the nanocomposite.

3.2.2 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. 
The structure of the material and valence state of various species present in the composite can be determined from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study. The high resolution XPS spectra of Mo 3d, O 1s, C 1s, N 1s and Cu 3d are shown in Fig. 5. The results of the survey scan of the Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 composite show the presence of C, N, O, Mo, and Cu in the composite (Fig. 5a).
 Fig. 5  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of (a) Mo, (b) O, (c) C, (d) N, (e) Cu and (f) survey scan of the 2% Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 photocatalyst. 
To determine the oxidation state of Mo and to further confirm surface oxygen deficiency, XPS of the Mo (3d3/2, 5/2) spin–orbit components are useful and are shown in Fig. 5b. The Mo 3d core level spectra of stoichiometric MoO3, show peaks centered at 235.6 eV and 232.4 eV, attributed to 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 of the Mo atom in the +6 oxidation state.17 However, in the synthesized Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 composite after deconvolution of the Mo 3d core level spectra, four peaks were obtained. One doublet at 235.8 eV (3d3/2) and 232.7 eV (3d5/2) for Mo6+ and another at 236.3 eV (3d3/2) and 233.2 eV (3d5/2) for Mo5+ were obtained, maintaining the same energy difference of 3.1 eV. The presence of both the Mo5+ and Mo6+ oxidation state in the XPS figure of Mo confirms the oxygen non-stoichiometry in the synthesized catalyst, which provides evidence for the partial reduction of the MoO3 phase. When the composite material is prepared in an inert atmosphere in presence of thiourea, reduction mainly takes place on the surface of MoO3, keeping the bulk unaffected. It can therefore be said that the oxygen non-stoichiometry was created by the loss of surface oxygen only. This is in agreement with the decreased crystallinity of the MoO3 phase in the composite, as the crystalline structure is partially destroyed.
The formation of a non-stoichiometric structure in the composite was further confirmed by the XPS of O 1s (Fig. 5c). According to reported data, the O 1s spectrum of MoO3 corresponds to lattice oxygen O2− at 531.3 eV and other two peaks at 533.1 eV and 534.6 eV correspond to the surface adsorbed oxygen species OH− and O2−. However, in orthogonal MoO3 in the as synthesized composite, the O 1s peak is slightly shifted to lower binding energy, i.e. at 530.46 eV (OI), 531.05 eV (OIII) and 532.18 eV (OII). The shifting of the binding energy to a lower value suggests a change in the coordination number configuration of Mo and O, along with the transfer of electrons to neighbouring oxygen vacancies. In the case of other transition metal oxides, the B.E also shifts to the lower energy region because of the oxygen non-stoichiometry. Based on these reported studies, the XPS spectra of O 1s further support the change in Mo–O bonds and the presence of oxygen non-stoichiometry in the material.18
The C 1s signal, upon deconvolution with Gaussian curve fitting, shows the existence of chemically different carbon species with binding energies 284.28 eV, 286.09 eV, 288.1 eV and 289.66 eV (Fig. 5d), while peaks centered at 284.28 and at 286.09 are more prominent and assigned to CC and C–O, respectively.19 The peaks centered at 288.1 eV and at 289.66 eV are assigned to the sp2 hybridised C atoms in the triazine rings inside the aromatic structure and NC–N group or –NH2 group as originating from g-C3N4, respectively. The XPS peak of N 1s (Fig. 5e) centered at 398.5 eV is assigned to C–N–C and the bridging N-atom, whereas the peak at 400.1 eV represents the presence of –NH and –NH2 groups. Fig. 5f represents the XPS spectra of Cu, confirming the presence of Cu in the composite. The two Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 peaks corresponding to binding energies 938.5 eV and 954.3 eV, with one satellite peak located at 943.9 eV, are perfectly harmonized with the +2 oxidation state of Cu and confirm the formation of CuO. Further, it has been noted that the 2p3/2 peak, upon deconvulation, results in another peak at around 933.5, representing Cu (0), which implies the presence of metallic copper along with CuO.20


3.2.3 Raman spectra. 
The crystal structure of the samples can be further determined from solid-state Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 6), which is sensitive to the coordination number, metal ligand distances and the symmetry around the metal centres. In addition to this, it helps to study details about the local and cooperative changes during the redox process involving defect structures created by oxygen vacancies and provides information about the domain size of MoO3 in the composite. In the case of neat g-C3N4, no significant Raman signals were observed (Fig. S3, (ESI†)); however, in MoO3, (1:4) MoO3/g-C3N4 and 2% Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4, the Raman signals were prominent.4 Large sized poly-molybdates showed Raman bands at 200–250 cm−1 that correspond to the antisymmetric stretching modes of MoO, Mo–O–Mo and the bending modes of MoO in the sample, but it is difficult to know the local coordination of Mo in MoOX because the stretching frequencies of tetrahedral and octahedral Mo overlap. Three prominent bands were observed between 600 cm−1 and 1100 cm−1, assigned to triply co-ordinate oxygen in the sample. The band at 660 cm−1 is due to asymmetrical stretching vibrations of O–Mo–O, the band at 813 cm−1 correspond to asymmetric MoO stretching and the band at 990 cm−1 is attributed to symmetrical stretching vibrations of terminal MoO bonds, showing the characteristics of orthorhombic MoO3. The actual positions of Raman bands in fully oxygenated MoO3 composites were reported to be located at 995 ± 1 cm−1, 820 ± 1 cm−1 and 665 ± 1 cm−1.10 However in o-vacancy created samples, the bands were slightly red shifted. The cause for the shift in the peak positions may be due to the higher volume density of the point defects,21 lattice strain22 and phonon confinement effect.23 Here, the main cause of Raman shift was attributed to oxygen vacancies created during the formation process.

3.3 Study of optical properties and electronic band structure (UV-DRS)
The optical properties of g-C3N4, MoO3, (1:4) MoO3/g-C3N4 and the 2% Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 were investigated through UV-Vis DRS spectra and the results are shown in Fig. 7. The MoO3/g-C3N4 composite shows a red shift in the absorption edge compared to the neat MoO3 and g-C3N4, which show absorption peaks at 430 nm and 450 nm, respectively. This red shift in the absorption edge makes the composite suitable for the generation of more photo-electrons and holes. Generally, in the case of transition metal oxides like MoO3, the loss of oxygen during calcinations creates new defect levels in the structure with trapped electrons. A weak broad peak centred at around 550 nm provides evidence for the presence of oxygen vacancies.24 Bands around 300 nm were assigned to tetrahedral Mo6+ and octahedral Mo6+ species. In the Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 composite with oxygen vacancy, the 4d state of Mo acts as the conduction band minimum and the 2p state of oxygen acts as the valence band maximum. The shifting of electrons from the oxygen vacancies to the 4d states of Mo sufficiently reduce the crystal field and result in the formation of extended 4d gap states. As a result, upon reducing treatments during calcinations, a number of broad absorption bands were found between 250–350 nm, due to electronic transitions. These electronic transitions are possibly due to the availability of various donor levels related to oxygen vacancies. As reported by Porter et al., inter-valence transitions are found in mixed-valent transition metal cations due to Frank-Condon excitation.25 The Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 composite showed significantly improved absorption in the visible region due to π–π* and n–π* transitions owing to the increase in surface electric charge of MoO3 in the nanocomposite. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the MoO3/g-C3N4 composite with different amounts of Cu (2%, 4%, 6% and 8%) are provided in Fig. S4a (ESI†). The deposition of Cu NPs was confirmed by the presence of an SPR band around 586 nm (dotted line).26 Band gaps for neat g-C3N4, MoO3 and the composite were calculated by using the Kubelka–Munk equation as 2.63 eV, 3.09 eV and 2.98 eV, respectively (Fig. S4b, 4c, 4d in the ESI†). Due to the formation of oxygen vacancies in MoO3, the composite showed an enhanced optical response, which was also further confirmed by XPS analysis.

3.4. Photogenerated electron–hole separation and transport (PL spectral analysis)
The photoluminescence spectra of the MoO3, (1:4) MoO3/g-C3N4 and 2% Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 nanocomposite (Fig. 8) were obtained at an excitation wave length of 315 nm in order to study the migration of charge carriers and effects of charge transfer. The main emission peak was observed at 410 nm for MoO3. The emission intensity of the composite significantly decreased on coupling with g-C3N4 and upon Cu loading. The PL emission of orthorhombic α-MoO3 was caused by band to band transitions and was also due to higher electron–hole recombination between the conduction band and the sublevel created in the band gap with oxygen vacancy. The decreased PL intensity was attributed to the formation of a unique heterostructure in the MoO3/g-C3N4 composite, indicating the lowest charge carrier recombination rate.17 Upon Cu loading, the intensity of the emission peak was further decreased due to the delayed recombination of electron hole pairs. The PL spectra of the MoO3/g-C3N4 composite with different amounts of Cu (2%, 4%, 6% and 8%) are provided in Fig. S5 (ESI†). This means that an increasing number of charge carriers take part in photocatalytic reactions since the lower PL intensities imply a slower recombination rate of the photo-generated electron–hole pairs. This result further confirms a strong interaction between g-C3N4 and MoO3 to promote interfacial charge transfer, separation and migration of photo-induced charge carriers by reducing the recombination of electron–hole pairs.

4. Electrochemical study
4.1 Linear sweep voltammetry studies
The improved photocatalytic performance of the composite photocatalyst was investigated by linear sweep voltammetry studies. The electrocatalytic activity of the Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 electrode was investigated by LSV using a three electrode system in 0.5 M Na2SO4 at 25 °C as shown in Fig. 9. In Fig. 9(a), the Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 electrode shows an onset potential of −0.89 mV vs. NHE and the current density of 12.1 mA cm−2 in light, as compared to other prepared samples. Fig. 9(b) shows the current density of Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 electrode both in the dark and in light, comparing the surface redox activity. The g-C3N4 and (1:4) MoO3/g-C3N4 electrodes displayed 0.4 mA cm−2 and 7.3 mA cm−2 of current, respectively. The Cu modified MoO3/g-C3N4 electrode exhibited a positive onset potential and much higher cathodic current density due to the presence of CuO, as compared to neat g-C3N4 and MoO3/g-C3N4 electrodes. The onset photocurrent potentials were −1.0 mV and −0.62 mV for neat g-C3N4 and MoO3/g-C3N4 composites, respectively. This increased current density under visible light irradiation may be attributed to the effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and less resistance offered by the photocatalyst. The induced plasmonic resonance of p-type CuO/Cu0 NPs accelerated the migration of photogenerated electrons through the Schottky barrier at the g-C3N4/CuO interfaces and a large number of electrons accumulated on the CB of CuO, resulting in higher photocurrent density along with enhanced H2 evolution. For an efficient hydrogen evolution catalyst, the strong binding of H-atoms on the catalytic site is an important requirement. In this regard, oxygen deficiencies and dislocations are desired to increase such binding sites. In the case of neat g-C3N4, although the CB potential of g-C3N4 is suitable for H2 evolution, the results are not satisfactory. However, in Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4, the presence of MoO3 with oxygen deficiencies promotes H-coupling, surface diffusion and bulk diffusion at the reduced surface. As a result, H diffusion and surface redox reaction can occur more readily and H2 generation also becomes competitive.27,28 These results further support the formation of a heterojunction and faster interfacial charge separation at the surface of Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 through a double Z-scheme mechanism. The LSV plots of the MoO3/g-C3N4 composite with different amounts of Cu (2%, 4%, 6% and 8%) and the LSV plots of various photocatalysts are provided in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Further, in order to investigate the electrocatalytic stability, chronoamperometry studies of Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 were carried out and the results are shown in Fig. S7 in the ESI.†

4.2 MS plot
To predict the mechanism of photocatalytic reactions, the determination of the potentials of the VB and CB with respect to the reduction and oxidation levels and the conductivity type of the semiconductors is very important. From the Mott-Schottky plots, the electronic band structures of g-C3N4, MoO3 and the composite material were investigated. The MS plot of neat g-C3N4, MoO3, CuO and 2%Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 were studied under constant frequency. The positive slope of the line segment suggests n-type characteristics for both g-C3N4 and MoO3, which is consistent with previously reported data,29 whereas a negative slope in the case of CuO indicates the p-type nature of Cu NPs. For all the materials, the x-intercept corresponds to the flat band potential of the respective semiconducting materials. The flat band potential values were found to be −1.59 V, −0.18 V, 1.95 V and −0.40 V vs. Ag/AgCl for g-C3N4, MoO3, CuO and 2% Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4, respectively, and the respective Fermi level positions were calculated to be −1.0 V, 0.2 V, 2.53 V and 0.18 V (Ag/AgCl vs. NHE), according to which the Fermi level position of g-C3N4 is higher than that of MoO3, and thus charges should migrate from the g-C3N4 to MoO3 through the interface. However, by calculating the corresponding EVB and ECB positions, charge transfer through the direct Z-scheme mechanism was established. In the case of neat g-C3N4, the ECB potential was calculated to be −1.2 V and ECB for neat MoO3 was calculated as +0.4 V vs. NHE. Moreover, by analyzing these data combined with the band gap values obtained from the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra, the EVB positions of the g-C3N4 and MoO3 were calculated as 1.43 V and 3.29 V, respectively. The EVB and ECB positions in CuO were found to be 2.73 V and 1.18 V, based on the band gap energy according to our previously reported study.6 Based on the electronic band edge potentials, a well aligned band diagram of the composite with an efficient charge separation can be predicted (Fig. 10).

5. Photocatalytic activity
5.1 Activity towards the water reduction reaction for the generation of H2
Although the band edge potentials of g-C3N4 make it suitable to undergo water redox reactions, the results were not satisfactory in most of the cases. Based on a number of reported studies,30–34 the photocatalytic activities of the as synthesised composites were studied by the water reduction reaction for the generation of H2 in the presence of methanol as the scavenger under ambient conditions for 2 h. A blank experiment was carried out in the absence of the photocatalyst to confirm the evolution of H2 only by photocatalytic reaction. As shown in Fig. 11a, the Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst shows superior activity with an H2 evolution rate of 652 μmol h−1, which is 9 times higher than that of neat g-C3N4 and 1.3 times higher than that of the MoO3/g-C3N4 composite. Pure MoO3, having positive VB potential showed no H2 evolution, whereas neat g-C3N4 showed a H2 evolution rate of 78.1 μmol h−1. In the MoO3/g-C3N4 composite, the rate of H2 evolution increased to 510 μmol h−1 because of the improved charge separation by the direct Z-scheme mechanism. Upon Cu loading, the H2 evolution rate further increased due to efficient light absorption by the SPR effect of Cu NPs and the development of an indirect Z-scheme charge transfer because of a negative shift in the Fermi level of CuO. The present study shows better compatibility and synergistic behaviour between two layered materials in the presence of Cu0/Cu2+ as co-catalyst. The apparent energy conversion efficiency was found to be 13.46%. To confirm the highest active MoO3/g-C3N4 sample, the H2 evolution experiments were also performed by taking different MoO3/g-C3N4 composites having wt ratios of 1:2, 1:6 and 1:8 (Fig. S8a, ESI†) and with different wt% (4%, 6% and 8%) of Cu loading (Fig. S8b, ESI†). Further, to optimize the conditions for H2 evolution, we have carried out the water reduction reaction by using methanol, triethanolamine and lactic acid; methanol as a scavenger showed the highest H2 evolution under the same conditions (Fig. S8c, ESI†).

5.1.1 Reusability testing of the photocatalyst towards H2 evolution. 
The stability and reusability of the photocatalyst was studied by repeating the H2 evolution experiment for four cycles. The activity of the catalyst was found unchanged even after the third run, and then decreased slightly under the same experimental conditions. From the graph in Fig. 11b, it can be summarized that the Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst is stable enough and is a promising photocatalyst towards the water splitting reaction.

5.2 Activity towards Cr(VI) reduction

5.2.1 Kinetics of Cr(VI) reduction. 
The photocatalytic activities of the prepared samples were also investigated by the reduction of hexavalent chromium under visible light irradiation (Fig. S9a, ESI†). Prior to light irradiation, the solutions were stirred in the dark for 30 min to ensure the establishment of adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and Cr(VI). It was observed that Cr(VI) solutions with 1.6, 2.1, 3.6, and 8.8% Cr(VI) were adsorbed on the surface of g-C3N4, MoO3, (1:4)MoO3/g-C3N4 and 2%Cu-(1:4)MoO3/g-C3N4, respectively. Upon light irradiation, it was observed that the photocatalytic reduction of g-C3N4 modified MoO3 showed better activity compared to the neat g-C3N4 and neat MoO3, which was further increased with Cu loading. To study the kinetics, the rates of degradation were monitored after certain time intervals. The percentage of reduction was monitored in 15 minutes time intervals to study the kinetics.
The photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) follows first-order kinetics: (1)where k′ = rate constant, c = concentration of Cr(VI) in solution, t = time interval.
This can be changed into the linear form as follows: (2)where co = the initial concentration of Cr(VI), c = concentration after time t.
The concentration of Cr(VI) is proportional to the absorbance obtained from UV-Visible spectroscopy. By plotting a graph of ln(c/co) vs. time, a straight line with negative slope was obtained, which represents a first order reaction. The values of the rate constants along with regression co-efficient (R2) are given in Table 1.

5.2.2 Effect of pH on Cr(VI) reduction. 
The pH of a test solution is always one of the most important controlling parameters in adsorption and photocatalytic reduction reactions because it influences the surface charge of the semiconductor and affects the interfacial electron transfer process. The reductions were carried out under acidic, neutral and basic pH and the reduction percentage was determined. It was observed that the photocatalytic reductions of the composites were found to decrease with the increase in pH of the solution. At lower pH, the surface of the photocatalyst is positively charged due to protonation and tends to attract HCrO4− ions and facilitates the adsorption process. Fig. 12a represents the effect of the pH of the solution in the reduction process. The highest reduction rate was found under an acidic pH, i.e. 3. At acidic pH, H+ ions are adsorbed onto the surface of the photocatalyst. By the formation of a positively charged surface, the catalyst acquires a large proton exchange capacity. When the same reaction is carried out in the presence of a hole scavenger (citric acid), the percentage of Cr reduction significantly increases. In the presence of citric acid, the surface of the photocatalyst becomes more positive and molecular oxygen competes with Cr(VI) to reach the adsorption sites. As a result, negatively charged HCrO4− ions are preferentially adsorbed, compared to neutral O2. The mechanism of Cr(VI) photoreduction therefore follows the pathway over the photocatalyst and would change from the two-step superoxide (˙O2−) mediated indirect reduction to the one-step direct photogenerated electrons reduction in the presence of citric acid, as represented by Scheme 2. The more negative CB potential of CuO along with Cu0 favours the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) under visible light irradiation.

 Scheme 2  Schematic of charge transfer by the double Z-scheme mechanism. 
The photo-generated electrons are captured by H+ to form Hads and are capable of reducing the Cr(VI). At higher pH, the reduction efficiency decreases owing to the negatively charged surface, which tends to repel the HCrO4− ions and hinders adsorption.  


5.2.3 The effect of dissolved O2 on the photoreduction of Cr(VI). 
To investigate the effect of dissolved O2 on the photoreduction of Cr(VI), the same reduction reaction of Cr(VI) was carried out by purging N2 gas to eliminate O2. The percentage of photoreduction was improved as shown in Fig. S9b (ESI†). Photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) at the CB of the semiconductor photocatalyst could be either through photogenerated electrons or other active species. It was reported by other groups that trapping of CB electrons by O2 plays an important role in photocatalysis.35 This not only improves the charge separation, but also generates reactive organic species to carry out the reaction. When the CB potential of a semiconductor photocatalyst is more negative than the reduction potential of O2 → O2˙− (i.e. −0.33 V), the O2˙− species are formed in the presence of molecular O2. In this system, since the CB position of g-C3N4 (−1.2 V vs. NHE) is more negative than the reduction potential of O2 → O2˙−, then O2˙− radicals are formed. It was found that the presence of citric acid improves the rate of degradation, and the photogenerated electrons present in the CB are the major species responsible for the reduction of Cr(VI); therefore, when reduction of Cr(VI) was carried out by eliminating O2, the percentage of Cr(VI) reduction was improved. This further proves the one-step direct photoreduction of Cr(VI). Since the likelihood for the consumption of electrons for the formation of O2˙− is suppressed, more photoelectrons are available on the CB to facilitate photoreduction as shown in the following reaction.  


5.2.4 Reusability testing of the photocatalyst towards Cr(VI) reduction. 
The photostability of the catalyst was examined for four consecutive cycles for the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI). After each cycle, the catalyst was centrifuged, washed with DI water and subjected to further reaction. As shown in Fig. 12d, there was no significant decrease in activity even after five cycles, which proves the good stability of the catalyst in the photocatalytic run. Further, the stability of the photocatalyst was confirmed by XRD analysis of the used photocatalyst. To examine the surface morphology of the spent photocatalyst XPS, TEM and HRTEM analyses were carried out. The results provided in Fig. S10 and S11 (ESI†) reveal no significant changes in crystal structure and morphology after the reusability experiment.

6. Explanation
The photocatalytic efficiency of the –MoO3/g-C3N4 composite is mainly attributed to two imperative phenomena, namely, the presence of oxygen vacancies in MoO3 and the charge transfer by the double Z-scheme mechanism. From the calculated band edge potentials of MoO3, g-C3N4 and CuO, a hetero junction charge transfer mechanism or a double Z-scheme mechanism for H2 evolution was proposed.36,37Scheme 2 displays a schematic of the visible light-induced photocatalytic activity with respect to NHE, representing the band edge potential and Fermi level (before contact and after contact). The CB potential calculated from the MS plot of defective MoO3 is not suitable for photocatalytic H2 evolution. However, the MoO3/g-C3N4 hybrid composite exhibited significantly higher H2 evolution, which supports a direct Z-scheme charge separation process. Further, on Cu loading, the Cu2+ ions have equal chance to be attracted towards both MoO3 and g-C3N4. Owing to the presence of lone pairs of electrons on the nitrogen atom of g-C3N4, Cu NPs preferably come in contact with the g-C3N4 surface and get partially reduced in good agreement with the XPS results. Cu NPs (Cu0/Cu2+) act as efficient catalysts by developing a p–n heterojunction, favouring the transfer of photo-generated electrons from the CB of g-C3N4 to the Fermi level of CuO, which develops an indirect Z-scheme. This double Z-scheme charge transfer along with the SPR effect of Cu NPs enrich the Fermi level of CuO with electrons, as the Fermi level of Cu0 is at 0.15 eV.12
By incorporating Cu NPs, the electrons from the CB of g-C3N4 as well as the SPR effect of Cu NPs get transferred to the Fermi level of CuO through the contact surface, which is at lower potential. Due to electron drift, there is an accumulation of photoelectrons on the VB of CuO; the Fermi level of CuO shifts to more negative potential. The SPR effect of Cu0 is also responsible for the more negative shift in the position of the VB of CuO to attain the Fermi level equilibrium. This negative movement of the Fermi level potential of CuO facilitates the inter-particle electron transfer and creates an indirect Z-scheme as reported by Dong et al.37,38 This indirect Z-scheme charge transfer process from g-C3N4 to CuO enriches the CB of CuO with electrons, and the VB of MoO3 is enriched with holes. As a result, a double Z-scheme charge transfer system is established, leading to higher cathodic current in the case of Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4, which is consistent with the H2 production and Cr(VI) reduction results.39–42 A typical direct-indirect double Z-scheme system is developed to enhance the separation of electron–hole pairs with superior photocatalytic performance.43 Moreover, it is worth pointing out that metallic Cu in the Cu0/Cu2+ redox couple acts as an acceptor to collect photogenerated electrons from the CB of CuO, further promoting the photocatalytic reaction.44,45
In stoichiometric MoO3, the 4d shell is empty and the material is quite stable. Structural defects are always considered as favourable for catalytic activity. Here, in the defective MoO3 sample, the O-vacancies donate electrons to the 4d shell of Mo, which is responsible for the superior activity of the material. In the Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 composite with oxygen vacancies, the 4d state of Mo acts as the conduction band minimum and the 2p state of oxygen acts as the valence band maximum. The shift of electrons from the oxygen vacancies to the 4d states of Mo reduce the crystal field sufficiently and result in the formation of extended 4d gap states, which enhance the light absorption capacity. Furthermore, the presence of O-vacancies on the surface of metal oxide nano-particles results in under-coordinated Mo5+ atoms, which easily attract oxygen atoms/negatively charged species present in air/water to obtain structural stability and increase the adsorption and reactivity of molecules at these sites.46 Therefore, water molecules are easily adsorbed on the surface of the composite and serve as electron acceptors and lower the energy barrier for HER. According to the traditional hetero junction type mechanism, the photoelectrons get transferred from the CB of g-C3N4 with a negative potential to the CB of MoO3 with a positive potential, which in turn decreases the electron reducibility. As a result, the accumulated electrons on the CB of MoO3 are not able to reduce O2 to form ˙O2−, or convert H+ into H2 without Pt co-catalyst. The transfer of electrons-holes following the conventional mechanism is therefore unfavourable for the Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 composite to generate active species and must show a lower amount of H2 evolution. This is not in good agreement with our experimental results for photocatalytic H2 production.
Therefore, the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the composite towards H2 evolution, and Cr(VI) reduction is according to the double Z-scheme mechanism.43 Upon visible light irradiation, when photoelectrons are generated, a great number of defects accumulate at the solid–solid interface, which possesses properties similar to that of a conductor and offer low electric resistance. These features prompt the interface to serve as a recombination center for e−–h+ pairs.47 Thus, the electrons generated from the CB of MoO3 could immigrate to the VB of g-C3N4via the solid–solid hetero-interface, and then recombine with the local holes, consequently accelerating the separation of photo-generated electrons from the CB of g-C3N4. The LSV data of the composite and N2 adsorption–desorption studies (Fig. S13, ESI†) further support the mechanism and superior photocatalytic response of the composite.
7. Conclusion
We have successfully synthesized a Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 heterojunction by a simple calcination-cum-impregnation method. Physico-chemical characterizations revealed a strong interconnected architecture, a suitable band gap that exhibited low resistance, high photocurrent and low photoluminescence intensity. Optimum band edge position and efficiently separated photogenerated charge carriers are responsible for the high photocatalytic activity of the Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 hybrid towards H2 evolution and reduction of Cr(VI). In the presence of citric acid, a hole scavenger, the Cu-MoO3/g-C3N4 nano-composite follows a one-step direct e-reduction mechanism rather than a two-step mechanism. Moreover, O-vacancies present in the defective MoO3 sample donate electrons to the 4d shell of Mo, and are responsible for the superior activity of the material. Due to the SPR effect, low-cost Cu NPs boost visible light absorption and help in the conversion of photons to electrons in the photocatalytic system. A double Z-scheme charge transfer and SPR effect of Cu NPs enrich the CB of CuO with electrons and make it more negative for the generation of H2 and the reduction of Cr(VI). This study highlights a new strategy for designing hybrid photocatalysts containing oxygen vacancy-rich, non-stoichiometric simple oxides towards harvesting sunlight. The simple design process, high photocatalytic activity, eco-friendliness and good recyclability of the photocatalyst are some of the attractive features that cause it to have great potential for applications in solar energy conversion and environmental purification.
