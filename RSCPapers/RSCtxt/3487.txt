    , Accepted 1st May 2012First published on 1st May 2012AbstractWe describe the fabrication of crystallographically preferred oriented TiO2 anatase nanotube arrays (p-NTAs) and the characterization of their photovoltaic properties. The preferred orientation to the (004) plane of the TiO2 nanotube array (NTA) was carefully controlled by adjusting the water content in the anodizing electrolyte; ∼2 wt% of water yielded a p-NTA, whereas other contents of water yielded randomly oriented NTAs (r-NTAs). A structural analysis using X-ray diffraction and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope revealed that the p-NTA showed a preferred orientation along the [001] direction of the anatase crystal structure. When the NTAs were employed to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as photoelectrodes, the p-NTA showed a similar electron lifetime to the r-NTA, which was an order of magnitude higher than that for a TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) film. Moreover, the p-NTA exhibited faster electron transport than the NP film, and even faster than the r-NTA. These properties resulted in a longer electron diffusion length of the p-NTA, compared to the r-NTA and NP film, thereby improving the charge collection property of the photoelectrode. The p-NTA exhibited superior photovoltaic energy conversion performance in the DSSC system, and showed a higher thickness for the optimal photovoltaic performance compared to the NP film, which were attributed to the excellent charge collection properties. Our results address that the crystallographic orientation of NTAs improves their charge transport properties, which can be applied to various optoelectronics, especially to solar-driven energy conversion devices.

Broader context
Due to explosive worldwide energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions, there has been extensive research on developing alternatives to fossil fuels. TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTAs) have been extensively investigated because of their unique properties in charge collection, surface reaction, and light harvesting, and due to promising applications in various fields such as sensing, photoelectrochemical water splitting, photovoltaics, and Li-ion batteries. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are regarded as one of the promising alternatives to conventional solar cells due to their low fabrication cost, adequate efficiency, and environmental compatibility. In this study, we report a novel NTA which is preferred oriented to the (004) plane of the anatase crystal, and demonstrate that the preferred oriented NTA-based DSSC exhibits higher charge transport properties, leading to higher energy conversion efficiency, compared to a nanoparticle-based DSSC. We believe that the knowledge obtained from this study can be applied to other photo-energy conversion devices, such as water-splitting photoelectrochemical cells, quantum dot solar cells and organic photovoltaic cells, and even in Li-ion batteries.

1. Introduction
One-dimensional (1-D) nanoarchitecture is an important area of research in the field of solar energy conversion devices, due to its unique charge-transport and light-confinement properties.1–8 In particular, TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTAs) grown through anodization of a Ti substrate are considered promising photoelectrode materials for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)2,9–13 because of their efficient utilization of incident light and retardation of charge recombination. These two characteristics result in excellent light harvesting and charge-collecting properties for the DSSCs.2,14,15
The highly oriented nature of TiO2 NTAs is likely to improve the charge transport properties of the NTA-based DSSC compared to a nanoparticle (NP) film-based DSSC, in which slow electron diffusion typically limits the device performance.16 However, Zhu et al. reported that TiO2 NTA-based DSSCs did not show superior electron transport properties compared to NP film-based DSSCs; this was ascribed to the polycrystalline anatase having a similar size in each photoelectrode.15 Considering the electron mobility in the TiO2 NP film (0.034 cm2 V−1 s−1),17 the TiO2 thin film with nanograins (4 cm2 V−1 s−1),18 and the TiO2 bulk single crystal (20 cm2 V−1 s−1),19 the electron transport property of NTA can be improved if a DSSC is constructed using anatase NTAs composed of single crystals or preferred oriented grains. Recently, Feng et al. demonstrated indirectly this possibility using vertically aligned, single crystalline rutile nanorods,20 which exhibited superior energy conversion efficiency to rutile NP film-based DSSC systems.21 However, fabrication of the single crystal-like or the preferred oriented anatase NTAs, and characterization of their charge transport properties have never been attempted, although considerable studies have been focused on 1-D structured anatase TiO2, especially anodized NTAs. Usually, as-anodized amorphous TiO2 nanotubes are transformed into polycrystalline nanotubes comprised of randomly oriented nanograins via a post-annealing process, which is the reason for the difficulties in the preparation of single crystal-like or preferred oriented anatase NTAs.9,15,22,23
In this paper, we report crystallographically controlled TiO2 anatase NTAs with a (004) preferred orientation and characterization of the photovoltaic properties of the preferred oriented NTA-based DSSCs. To fabricate the preferred orientated NTA, we used the anodization reaction with a careful control of water content in the anodizing electrolyte. Ethylene glycol (EG) and ammonium fluoride (NH4F) were used as a solvent and a solute, respectively, for the anodizing electrolyte. We chose the sample obtained using a water content of 2 wt% as the p-NTA because the NTA exhibited a preferred orientation after the annealing process that is shown in Fig. 1. For comparison, a typical, randomly oriented NTA (water content of 5 wt%) was selected as the counterpart and called r-NTA. Using the p-NTA and r-NTA, we investigated the electron transport properties of the p-NTA in the DSSC system (Fig. 1), in comparison with TiO2 NP films. The p-NTA-based DSSCs exhibited much higher short circuit current (Jsc) and energy conversion efficiency than the r-NTA or NP film-based DSSCs. The superior photovoltaic energy conversion performance of the p-NTA-based DSSC was attributed to the slow charge recombination and fast electron diffusion properties of p-NTA, compared to the r-NTA and NP film.

2. Results and discussion
As aforementioned, we found that the crystallographically preferred oriented NTAs can be fabricated by control of the water content in the anodizing electrolyte. Because of the highly hygroscopic nature of EG and NH4F, the water content in the EG had to be controlled carefully. Moisture in EG was removed through evaporation before adding the required quantities of water and NH4F. NH4F was stored in a vacuum vessel before addition to the EG. The EG-based electrolyte was prepared and stored in an inert atmosphere. The anodizing reactions were performed also in the inert atmosphere to prevent the infiltration of moisture during the reactions.

Fig. 2(a)–(d) show the field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images of the anodized samples with water contents of 2 and 5 wt%, in ethylene glycol containing NH4F (0.25 wt%) with 50 V of applied bias. These figures show that the anodic TiO2 layer is a geometrically highly ordered nanotube array that stands vertically on the Ti substrate. The nanotube arrays grew to approximately 11.5 and 11.8 μm in length, using water contents of 2 and 5 wt%, for 2 h and 5 h of reaction, respectively. The NTA grown using 2 wt% of water content had a smooth surface, whereas the NTA grown using 5 wt% had a few small ribs (see Fig. S1, ESI†). Except for the ribs, the morphology was similar for each sample (2 and 5 wt%). The average outer diameter of each nanotube is approximately 150 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 2(e) and (f)) show that the TiO2 nanotube was fairly straight, and the wall thickness was approximately 50 nm. The selected-area electron beam diffraction (SAD) pattern shown in the inset of Fig. 2(f) indicated that the as-grown TiO2 nanotubes were amorphous.

The crystal structures of the NTAs after an annealing process were identified using an X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The amorphous NTA begins crystallization to the anatase phase at about 300 °C, and the phase transition to rutile begins at about 600 °C (Fig. S2(a), ESI†). In order to obtain well-crystallized anatase NTAs, we annealed the as-grown NTAs at 450 °C, because the crystallinity of the NTAs was not changed significantly above 400 °C, which was deduced from the XRD peak intensity of the annealed NTAs (Fig. S2(b), ESI†). To compare the relative peak intensities of NTAs, XRD data from a TiO2 NP film on a Ti substrate were also collected. Fig. 3(a) shows the XRD patterns of the NP film, the r-NTA, and the p-NTA, which indicate a pure TiO2 anatase structure (tetragonal, I41/amd) in each case. It should be noted that the intensity ratios of peaks for the (004) plane to the (200) plane are significantly different for each sample. The intensity ratio varied significantly with increasing the water content, as plotted in Fig. 3(b). The intensity ratios are 1.0, 1.1 and 17.3 for the NP film, the r-NTA, and the p-NTA, respectively. The extraordinarily high peak intensity of the (004) plane for the p-NTA implies that the vertically grown nanotubes were preferentially oriented along the [001] direction, i.e. the (004) plane, of the TiO2 anatase structure (inset of Fig. 3(b)).

Asterisks indicate the XRD peaks for the Ti substrate, and the peaks for TiO2 anatase are marked in the figure as A. (b) Intensity ratios of the peaks for the (004) plane to the (200) plane as a function of water content in the anodic solution. The dashed line indicates the intensity ratio (I(004)/I(200)) of the NP film. The inset of (b) shows the scheme of the TiO2 anatase unit cell. 

Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the TEM images and the SAD patterns of the nanotubes obtained from the p-NTA and the r-NTA, respectively. The single crystal-like patterns from the p-NTA (inset of Fig. 4(a)) indicate (004)-oriented anatase grains, which is in good agreement with the XRD results. The diffracted pattern of the (004) plane lies parallel to the longitudinal direction of the tubes and perpendicular to the pattern of the (200) plane. On the other hand, the ring patterns from the r-NTA (inset of Fig. 4(b)) imply that the r-NTA is composed of randomly oriented anatase crystals. The schematic diagrams of each nanotube are presented in inset B of Fig. 4(a) and (b). Fig. 4(c) and (d) show cross-sections of the p-NTA. Only {200} planes were observed in the SAD pattern from the cross-section of a single nanotube (inset of Fig. 4(d)), confirming that the normal direction of the observed plane was [001]. The lattice images and fast Fourier transform (FFT) images with respect to four locations (I, II, III, and IV shown in Fig. 4(d)) showed only {200} planes (Fig. 4(e)–(h)), which also strongly supports the [001]-preferred orientation of the p-NTA.

(e–h) The HRTEM lattice images and the FFT images obtained from the partial regions (I, II, III, and IV, respectively) that are marked in (d). The d spacing of the lattice is 0.189 nm, which verifies that the perfect square-like lines denote the (200) plane of the anatase crystal. The lattice and FFT images demonstrate that the zone axis of the single ring (cross-section of the nanotubes) is [001] of the anatase crystal. 
Although the (004)-oriented TiO2 NTA was successfully fabricated by controlling the water content of the anodizing solution, the mechanism of the generation of a preferred orientation is not fully understood yet. However, the optimization of the quantity of hydroxyl groups in as-grown nanotubes seems to be one of the key factors in fabricating preferred oriented TiO2 NTAs, because a much lower amount of hydroxyl groups was detected in the p-NTA, compared to the r-NTA, after anodization (Fig. S3, ESI†). Li and Young have reported that the water content in electrolytes can change the quantity of hydroxyl ions injected into the body of the oxide24 because water molecules in an anodizing solution are an oxygen source for oxide formation, and hydroxyl ions are considered as oxidizers.24–27 Because the hydroxyl group was not detected from both of the nanotubes after annealing (Fig. S3, ESI†), this dehydroxylation of nanotubes during an annealing process may lead to the breaking down of the amorphous bulk tube walls into anatase nanocrystals, and therefore a large quantity of incorporated hydroxyl ions may hinder the directing of the crystallization process into well-oriented nanograins. Further study on the role of hydroxyl groups on the crystallization behaviour is going on in our group. Our recent results shown in Fig. S4, ESI†, demonstrate that one may obtain an extremely preferred oriented NTA (I(004)/I(200) ratio > 250) by controlling the water content of the anodizing electrolyte. Therefore, it is certain that the preferred oriented TiO2 NTAs can be obtained by controlling the water content of the anodizing solution.
The photovoltaic properties of a DSSC employing a p-NTA were characterized in comparison with DSSCs employing an r-NTA and an NP film whose thicknesses (11.8 and 11.4 μm, respectively) are almost identical to that of the p-NTA (11.5 μm). As the Ti substrate is opaque, we fabricated the DSSCs using a transparent Pt counter electrode in order to characterize the photovoltaic properties under back-side illumination.28Fig. 5(a) presents the J–V characteristics of the DSSCs employing p-NTAs, r-NTAs, and NP films, and the photovoltaic parameters that were calculated from the curves are summarized in Table 1. The p-NTA-based DSSC showed the highest energy conversion efficiency of 2.71%, whereas the efficiencies of the r-NTA- and NP film-based DSSCs were 2.14 and 2.38%, respectively. This trend resulted from the noticeably different short circuit current densities (Jsc) of the DSSCs. The Jsc of the p-NTA cell was considerably higher by 44% than that of the r-NTA, and 60% higher than that of NP film cells. However, the lower fill factor (ff) and the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the NTA-based cells, compared to that of the NP film-based cells, limited the increase in the overall energy conversion efficiency. In many cases, the anodized nanotube based DSSCs showed lower values of ff and Voc than the NP-based ones. Zhu et al. attributed the comparatively low ff and Voc of anodized nanotube-based DSSCs to an insulating oxide layer which forms between the nanotubes and the Ti substrate, because a large series resistance can be induced by a thin oxide layer.15 We confirmed the formation of a ∼70 nm thick compact oxide layer (Fig. S5, ESI†), which might be responsible for the low ff of the NTA-based DSSCs.

The value of Jsc is determined by several factors, including the light-harvesting property (ηlh), the quantum yield for electron injection from dye molecules into the TiO2 conduction band (ηinj), and the electron collection property (ηcc), i.e. Jsc ∝ ηlh × ηcc × ηinj.29 The light-harvesting property is directly related to the degree of dye loading, but the NP film showed slightly higher dye loading (1.65 × 10−7 mol cm−2) than the r-NTA (1.33 × 10−7 mol cm−2) and p-NTA (1.49 × 10−7 mol cm−2). Therefore, the light-harvesting property cannot explain the high Jsc of p-NTA-based DSSC. Moreover, the quantum yield for electron injection was ignored because we used the identical N719 dye, which is known to have a quantum yield of more than 90%, in Ru dye-based DSSCs.29,30 Therefore, we estimated the electron collection properties by evaluating the electron diffusion coefficients (Dn), lifetimes (τn), and diffusion lengths, Ln = (Dnτn)1/2,31 of the prepared DSSCs, as shown in Fig. 5(b). For both p-NTA and r-NTA, the lifetime τn was longer than that for the NP films by an order of magnitude, which is consistent with a previous report.15 It is noteworthy that the p-NTA showed a considerably larger Dn compared to the other samples, whereas neither the r-NTA nor the NP film showed a large discrepancy in Dn. Our results demonstrate that the electron transport properties of the TiO2 NTA can be significantly enhanced by controlling the crystallographic preferred orientation. The preferred oriented TiO2 nanotube can effectively transport the charge carriers because of the reduced number of defective regions compared to the randomly oriented nanotube, such as high angle grain boundaries that can scatter or trap the charge carriers.32–34 Due to a combination of fast electron transport and slow recombination, the p-NTA shows considerably longer Ln than the r-NTA and the NP film. Therefore, the large photocurrent density and energy conversion efficiency of the p-NTA-based DSSC can be attributed to its significant high electron collection efficiency ηcc (ηcc = 1 − τc/τr,15 where τc is the collection time and τr is the recombination time), ∼0.95 (∼0.89 for r-NTA). Moreover, the extremely long Ln of the p-NTA (approximately 30 μm to 35 μm) implies that a decrease in the randomness of nanograins can facilitate the use of a considerably thicker TiO2 layer than that of common TiO2 NP films (∼10 μm), which may lead to an improvement in the light-harvesting efficiency of DSSCs.
To investigate the effect of film thickness on the photovoltaic energy conversion property, we prepared NP films and p-NTAs with various thicknesses. The thickness of the p-NTA was controlled by varying the anodization time (Fig. S6, ESI†). Photovoltaic J–V curves of DSSCs fabricated with the NP films and p-NTAs were measured (Fig. 6(a) and (b)), and the resulting photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1 and plotted in Fig. 6(c) and (d) (Jsc and efficiency (η) as a function of film thickness). It is noticeable that Jsc of the p-NTA-based DSSC gradually increased as the thickness increased up to 20–30 μm, whereas that of the NP film-based DSSC dropped significantly when the thickness was over 15.2 μm. This result is consistent with the much longer Ln of p-NTA than that of the NP film. Although the p-NTA showed a fractional decline in the energy conversion efficiency for thicknesses over 17 μm due to the slight decreases in ff and Voc, the efficiency trend of the p-NTA, also, can be distinguished clearly from that of the NP film; the efficiency of the NP film-based DSSC for thicknesses over 15.2 μm diminished more sharply (by 38%) compared with the p-NTA-based DSSC (by 7%). Moreover, the maximum efficiency of the p-NTA (17.0 μm)-based DSSC was higher by 40% than that of the NP film (15.2 μm)-based DSSC. Considering that cell fabrication processes (such as TiCl4-treatment)2,35 were not optimized in this study, the efficiency of the p-NTA-based DSSC might be improved if one optimizes the cell fabrication processes. Moreover, the back-side illumination is known to diminish the cell efficiency by about 30% compared to the front-side (working electrode-side) illumination,36 because the Pt-coated counter electrode and the electrolyte between the counter electrode and the TiO2 photoelectrode block much of the incident light between the wavelength of 300 nm to 500 nm (see Fig. S7, ESI†). Therefore, the efficiency of the p-NTA-based DSSC might be significantly improved if one transfers the NTAs from the Ti substrate to a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate, or directly grows the NTAs on TCOs.37,38

3. Conclusions
Crystallographically preferred oriented TiO2 anatase NTAs can be obtained by controlling the water content in an anodizing solution, and the photovoltaic and electron collection properties of the p-NTA were investigated. XRD and TEM analyses demonstrated that anodizing a Ti substrate in an electrolyte containing 2 wt% of water yielded the (004) preferred oriented TiO2 anatase NTA after an annealing process. The DSSC employing the p-NTA showed excellent photovoltaic current density and higher energy conversion efficiency compared to the r-NTA- or NP film-based DSSCs. The p-NTA photoelectrode exhibited faster electron transport than its counterparts and a longer electron lifetime than the NP film, which led to a considerably longer electron diffusion length of the p-NTA photoelectrode. Finally, the p-NTA-based DSSC exhibited the maximum values of Jsc and efficiency at a higher range of film thickness values compared with the NP film-based DSSC. These results address that the crystallographic orientation of NTAs can modify and improve their photoelectric properties, which can be applied to various optoelectronics, especially to solar-driven energy conversion devices.
4. Experimental methods
Preparation and characterization of TiO2 NTAs
Prior to anodization, the Ti plates (2 mm thickness, Sigma Aldrich) were polished with diamond paste (3 μm) and cleaned with acetone, ethanol, and distilled water. The cleaned substrates were subjected to potentiostatic anodization in an electrolytic solution containing 0.25 wt% of NH4F (98+%, Sigma Aldrich) in EG (99.8%, anhydrous, Sigma Aldrich). The exposed area of the Ti substrate for anodization was 0.5 × 0.5 cm2. The Ti substrates were connected to a DC power supply (50 V) and a platinum plate was used as a counter electrode. The water content of the EG-based electrolyte was varied from 1.0 to 10.0 wt%. In particular, we chose the sample obtained using a water content of 2 wt% as the p-NTA sample because the NTA exhibited a preferred orientation after annealing at 450 °C for 1 h. For comparison, a typical, randomly oriented NTA (water content of 5 wt%) was selected as the counterpart and called r-NTA. Because of the highly hygroscopic nature of EG and NH4F, the water content in the EG was controlled carefully. For a reproducible experiment, the moisture in the EG was removed through evaporation before adding the required quantity of water and NH4F. Also, NH4F was stored in a vacuum vessel before addition to EG. The EG-based electrolyte was prepared and stored in a glove box (Ar atmosphere). All of the anodizing reactions were performed in a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent the infiltration of moisture from the air into the electrolytic solution. The crystalline structures were identified using an XRD (M18XHF-SRA, MAC-Science Instruments, Japan). The morphology of the synthesized nanotubes was observed by using a FESEM (JSM 6330F, Japan) and a HRTEM (JEM 3000F, Japan). Cross-sectional TEM images of the NTA were obtained with the aid of a focused ion beam system (FIB system, SMI3050SE, SII Nanotechnology). The hydroxyl groups in the NTAs were confirmed by using a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR, Nicolet 6700, Thermo Scientific) analysis.
Fabrication and characterization of DSSCs
Sandwich-type DSSCs were fabricated using iodide electrolytes (AN-50, Solaronix) and N719 dye (Solaronix) by following the standard preparation procedure described in a previous report.39 The 20 nm-sized pure anatase TiO2 nanoparticles were used for the TiO2 NP film on a Ti substrate. The preparation of TiO2 NPs and NP films is also described in our previous report.39 As the Ti substrate is opaque, the photovoltaic properties should be characterized using backside illumination.28 Transparent counter electrodes were prepared by spin-coating the H2PtCl6 solution (5 mM in isopropanol) on a fluorine-doped tin oxide electrode (TEC 15, Pilkington) followed by heat-treatment at 450 °C for 1 h in air. The photovoltaic properties of the fabricated solar cells (0.25 cm2 active area) under the illumination of an air mass of 1.5 (with a solar simulator, Peccell Technologies; intensity: 100 mW cm−2) were measured using a potentiostat (CHI 608C, CH Instruments). The light intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated using a reference cell (PV Measurements, USA). The external quantum efficiency as a function of incident wavelength was measured by using an incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) system (Mc-science spectral system, K3100, Japan). The values of τn and Dn were obtained from the decay of the Voc and Jsc values, which were measured by using the stepped light-induced transient measurements of the photovoltage (SLIM-PV) and photocurrent (SLIM-PC) methods, respectively, using a laser diode (660 nm).40

Broader context
Due to explosive worldwide energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions, there has been extensive research on developing alternatives to fossil fuels. TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTAs) have been extensively investigated because of their unique properties in charge collection, surface reaction, and light harvesting, and due to promising applications in various fields such as sensing, photoelectrochemical water splitting, photovoltaics, and Li-ion batteries. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are regarded as one of the promising alternatives to conventional solar cells due to their low fabrication cost, adequate efficiency, and environmental compatibility. In this study, we report a novel NTA which is preferred oriented to the (004) plane of the anatase crystal, and demonstrate that the preferred oriented NTA-based DSSC exhibits higher charge transport properties, leading to higher energy conversion efficiency, compared to a nanoparticle-based DSSC. We believe that the knowledge obtained from this study can be applied to other photo-energy conversion devices, such as water-splitting photoelectrochemical cells, quantum dot solar cells and organic photovoltaic cells, and even in Li-ion batteries.


 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic diagrams of the highly ordered TiO2 NTA, (b) the preferred oriented TiO2 nanotube, (c) the randomly oriented TiO2 nanotube, and (d) the process for fabricating the TiO2 NTA and the NTA-based DSSC.	 

 	Fig. 2  FESEM images of the (a) cross-section, (b) top, and (c) bottom of the NTA grown in a 2 wt% water-added electrolyte, and the (d) cross-section of the NTA grown in 5 wt% of water-added electrolyte; (e and f) TEM images of a single TiO2 nanotube grown in 2 wt% of water-added electrolyte, where the inset of (f) shows the SAD pattern of the nanotube.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) XRD patterns of the NP film, r-NTA, and p-NTA on Ti substrates after annealing at 450 °C for 1 h. Asterisks indicate the XRD peaks for the Ti substrate, and the peaks for TiO2 anatase are marked in the figure as A. (b) Intensity ratios of the peaks for the (004) plane to the (200) plane as a function of water content in the anodic solution. The dashed line indicates the intensity ratio (I(004)/I(200)) of the NP film. The inset of (b) shows the scheme of the TiO2 anatase unit cell.	 

 	Fig. 4  TEM images of the nanotubes obtained for (a) p-NTA and (b) r-NTA (scale bar: 100 nm). Inset A shows the SAD patterns for the nanotubes (scale bar: 5 nm−1), and inset B is the schematic diagram of the nanotubes. (c and d) Cross-sectional TEM images of the TiO2 nanotubes obtained from the p-NTA. The inset of (d) is the SAD pattern of (d). (e–h) The HRTEM lattice images and the FFT images obtained from the partial regions (I, II, III, and IV, respectively) that are marked in (d). The d spacing of the lattice is 0.189 nm, which verifies that the perfect square-like lines denote the (200) plane of the anatase crystal. The lattice and FFT images demonstrate that the zone axis of the single ring (cross-section of the nanotubes) is [001] of the anatase crystal.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Photovoltaic J–V curves, and (b) electron lifetimes (τn, left axis), diffusion coefficients (Dn, right axis), and electron diffusion lengths (Ln, right axis) of the NP film (11.4 μm)-, r-NTA (11.8 μm)-, and p-NTA (11.5 μm)-based DSSCs.
