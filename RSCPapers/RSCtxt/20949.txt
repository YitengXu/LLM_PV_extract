    , Accepted 14th May 2020First published on 14th May 2020AbstractIn recent years, global environmental problems caused by burning fossil fuels have become increasingly serious. Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) that use highly efficient clean renewable fuels (hydrogen, H2) to generate electricity have received a lot of attention. The main drawback of current PEMFC technology is the high cost caused by the high content of precious metal platinum (Pt) in catalysts for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Therefore, the development of stable and efficient low Pt content or Pt-free catalysts for the ORR is one of the current research hotspots. Currently, cobalt (Co)-based electrocatalysts for the ORR have attracted extensive attention. This research provides potential to reduce the Pt content or prevent the use of Pt in electrocatalysts, while keeping high activity and stability. This review summarizes recent advances in Co-based electrocatalysts including Co–Pt-based materials, Co,N-doped carbon (Co–N–C) materials, heterometal-doped Co–N–C materials and nonmetal-doped Co–N–C materials. In addition, this review also discusses the structure–activity relationship and the way in which the structural characteristics of electrocatalysts, such as the surface area and accessible active sites, and heteroatom doping affect their ORR activities. We hope that this review could shed some light on the design and development of electrocatalysts that can be industrialized in PEMFCs.Zuozhong LiangZuozhong Liang is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Shaanxi Normal University under the guidance of Prof. Rui Cao.

1. Introduction
The development of new energy sources that can replace fossil fuels is essential to respond to the growing global energy demand and environmental issues. Hydrogen (H2) energy is a promising candidate, which can be converted into electricity with high efficiency through direct electrochemical conversion in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), and the by-product is only water.1–3 A PEMFC involves two reactions: H2 oxidation reaction (HOR) and oxygen (O2) reduction reaction (ORR). Compared to the HOR, the ORR is a kinetically sluggish reaction with multiple steps of electron transfer. Currently, the best catalysts for the ORR are platinum (Pt)-based materials.4–8 However, the high price of Pt-based materials (>40%) in fuel cell stacks is the main difficulty in popularizing fuel cell vehicles.1 In view of the high cost of commercial Pt-based materials, the development of low Pt content or Pt free catalysts is an important improvement in PEMFC technologies.
Currently, two main strategies were applied to reduce the dosage of Pt in PEMFCs. One is to design low Pt content catalysts by introducing low cost transition metals (M = Co, Ni, Fe, etc.).9–12 Among these M–Pt-based materials, Co–Pt alloys exhibit effective ORR activity due to a suitable surface electronic structure (d-band center).13 Recently, a Co–Pt alloy-based catalyst has been applied in Mirai fuel cell vehicles by Toyota Motor Corporation launched in 2014. In addition, regulating the shape (such as nanoparticles (NPs), nanowires, etc.), composition (such as bimetallic, trimetallic, and tetrametallic alloys) and structure (such as nanotube, core–shell, hollow etc.) will further enhance the ORR performance.4–6 The other one is to develop Pt-free catalysts. For Pt-free catalysts, there are various kinds of materials including N-doped carbon (N–C) materials, metal-doped N–C (M–N–C) materials, metal oxides, phosphides, chalcogenides, etc.11,14–16 M–N–C materials have shown the impressive catalytic performance and become the most likely type of Pt-free catalyst to replace Pt-based catalysts for electrolytic reduction of O2 (M is mainly Fe or Co).17 The Fe–N–C material has been widely investigated due to its desirable activity.18–22 However, the dissolution of Fe catalysts in acid and the generation of H2O2 will result in Fenton reactions, which would form OH and OOH radicals and destroy the membranes and catalysts in PEMFCs.23 In contrast, Co–N–C materials also displayed encouraging activity and stability but with initiated Fenton reactions. As a result, Co-based catalysts have attracted wide attention.24
In this review, we first briefly summarize current progress of Co–Pt-based materials with diverse structures and compositions. Then, we focus on Co-based catalysts used for the ORR in recent years. Three types of Co-based materials for the ORR are summarized including Co–N–C materials, Co–M–N–C materials (M = Cu, Ni, Fe, etc.), and Co–X–N–C materials (X = B, S, P, etc.). Co-based oxides, phosphides, and chalcogenides for the ORR are also briefly introduced. The synthesis strategy and catalytic activity of these Co-based catalysts are systematically discussed. In addition, the review also discusses the effects of the structural characters of electrocatalysts including the morphology, surface area, accessible active sites, and heteroatom doping, on the ORR performance.
2. The PEMFC and ORR

Fig. 1a displays a typical PEMFC powered vehicle. The PEMFC is a clean energy-conversation device which converts H2 energy into electrical energy without harmful pollution or emission. The source of H2 could be obtained from solar-driven water splitting with zero emission.26 O2 is usually from the air. Herein, a simple H2–O2 PEMFC has 7 primary layers including a H2 flow plate (FP, 1), H2 diffusion layer (GDL, 2), anode catalyst layer (CL, 3), proton exchange membrane (PEM, 4), cathode CL (5), air DL (6), and air FP (7) (Fig. 1b). At the anode, H2 could be oxidized to protons (H+) with electrons (e−) produced (eqn (1)). The generated H+ will cross over the PEM and react with O2 and e− to form H2O at the cathode (eqn (2)). The theoretical potential of this reaction is 1.23 V (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). The generated e− will go through an external circuit. The net reaction is the production of H2O from H2 and O2 (eqn (3)). Compared to the HOR, the ORR is a kinetically sluggish reaction, which needs efficient electrocatalysts.27,28 HOR: 2H2 → 4e− + 4H+, E0 = 0 V (vs. RHE) (anode)(1) ORR: O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O, E0 = 1.23 V (vs. RHE) (cathode)(2) All: 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O (net)(3)

(b) A typical membrane electrode assembly (MEA) for a PEMFC with HOR and ORR processes. H2 and air enter or leave the unit cell through the flow plate (FP). After crossing the gas diffusion layer (DL), H2 reacts in the anode catalyst layer (CL) and forms protons H+. Then, the produced protons H+ cross over the proton exchange membrane (PEM) and react with O2 in the cathode CL to form H2O. 
The ORR mechanism has two paths (4e− and 2e− paths).26 The 4e− path is more thermodynamically favorable. (4) (5) OOH* + e− → O* + OH−(6) O* + H2O + e− → OH* + OH−(7) OH* + e− → OH− + *(8)The * represents the real active site of the selected electrocatalyst. The OOH*, O*, and OH* are active intermediates. The 4e− reduction of a specific catalyst is considered as the optimum to reduce O2 to H2O. The real reaction mechanism of the 4e− process is mainly attributed to the O2 dissociation energy on the electrocatalyst. The production of H2O2 in the 2e− process will decrease the catalytic efficiency. More recently, the highly efficient preparation of H2O2 also has aroused wide concern due to the broad application of H2O2, which is also an promising sustainable energy carrier to replace oil or H2.29,30
The evaluation of a catalyst could be carried out by measuring LSV curves through coating catalysts on a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE). A typical LSV curve contains two current densities (j), which are jdisk and jring measured on the disk and ring electrode, respectively, with the RRDE (Fig. 2a). The electrocatalytic activity of a specific catalyst could be evaluated with the onset potential (Eonset) and half-wave potential (E1/2). The Eonset is the potential at the inflection point of the kinetically controlled region. With the decrease of applied potential, the j will reach a platform in the diffusion-controlled region at a specific rotation speed (e.g. 1600 rpm), called the diffusion-limited j (jL). This is attributed to the saturation of O2 in the electrolyte and the equilibrium of mass transfer. The E1/2 is the potential of the middle point j of the jL in the mixed kinetic-diffusion-controlled region. An efficient ORR electrocatalyst gives much positive Eonset and E1/2.

The electron transfer number (n) could be obtained according to the current on the disk electrode (Id) and ring electrode (Ir) of obtained LSV curves with eqn (9). n = 4Id/(Id + Ir/N)(9)N stands for the collection efficiency of the ring electrode, which is a specific parameter of the RRDE. In addition, the electrocatalytic performance could be assessed by assembling catalysts into a MEA, as shown in Fig. 1b.32 However, the fabrication technology of a MEA has a great effect on ORR performance.15 Therefore, a RRDE is widely used in ORR evaluation for catalysts.
The oxygen binding energy (ΔEO) is associated with the ORR mechanism. Therefore, the ΔEO was usually applied as a descriptor to compare the ORR performance. The theoretical calculation gives a volcano plot with Pt near the top (Fig. 2b).31 Both too strong and too weak binding of oxygen are not good for the catalyst according to the ORR mechanism. The corresponding experiment also confirms that Pt-based catalysts have excellent ORR activity compared to other precious or nonprecious metals. Accordingly, the development of Pt-based catalysts with improved ORR performance is a research hotspot.7,8 Recently, Li et al. prepared an ultrafine jagged Pt nanowire with an E1/2 of 0.935 V (vs. RHE) in acid.33 However, Pt is very expensive and has relatively low reserves on the earth (Fig. 2c).15 Furthermore, the cost of Pt accounts for >40% of the total cost of a FC powered vehicle, which limits the large-scale production. To solve this problem, low Pt content catalysts and Pt-free catalysts have been investigated. Constructing a single atom Pt-based catalyst is one possible strategy.34 Constructing Pt-based multi-metallic materials by introducing other metals (e.g. Co, Ni, and Fe) is another strategy (Fig. 2c). Other strategies have been proposed such as shape regulation and structural design including alloy, core–shell, and hollow structures (Fig. 2d).15
For low Pt content catalysts, Co, Ni, and Fe have been applied to synthesize M–Pt bimetallic alloys with different shapes and compositions. The Co element is one of the most promising candidates. Firstly, the Co element has relatively rich reserves and low price. Secondly, the Co–Pt-based alloy, especially for the Pt3M alloy, has more suitable ΔEO.13,38,39 Stamenkovic et al. found that Pt3Co exhibited better catalytic activity for the ORR than Pt in 0.1 M HClO4 (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, they found the connection between the ORR performance and surface electronic structure of Pt3M bimetallic alloys (M = Co, Fe, Ni, and Ti) (Fig. 3b).13 The d-band center is a widely used descriptor to reflect the surface electronic structure.40 Experimentally, the Pt3Co bimetallic alloy exhibits the best ORR activity with volcano shape plots (red plots).13,40 Theoretically, Pt3Ni and Pt3Co have a relatively better activity than Pt3Fe and Pt3Ti based on the calculation (black plots). Therefore, transition metal Co has been widely applied in constructing Co–Pt-based electrocatalysts with different shapes, compositions and structures. Recently, Bu et al. prepared a new kind of hierarchical Pt3Co nanowire with more exposed high-index facets (Fig. 3c).35 Three hierarchical Co–Pt nanowires with different contents of Pt were prepared. Pt3Co/C exhibits the best ORR performance compared to the other nanowires with a large amount of Pt. Furthermore, Wang et al. prepared a novel Pt-based core–shell NP with ordered Pt3Co as the core and several atomic layers of Pt as the shell.36 Pt3Co/C after pre-treatment at 700 °C (Pt3Co/C-700) exhibits the best catalytic activity (E1/2 = 0.945 V vs. RHE, 0.1 M HClO4). Li et al. obtained a similar CoPt/Pt core–shell NP with intermetallic Pt and Co as the core (Fig. 3d and e).41 Multi-metallic CoPt-based materials were also reported to further reduce the dosage of Pt. Recently, Jiang et al. prepared a sub-nanometer trimetallic CoPtNi nanowire with 4–5 atomic-layer-thickness.42 More recently, Li et al. synthesized a trimetallic CoPtTe nanotube.43 Furthermore, Liu et al. prepared a tetrametallic CoPtCuNi nanotube with a low Pt content, which exhibits enhanced ORR performance (Fig. 3f).37 These 1D CoPt-based structures such as nanowires and nanotubes have unique advantages compared to NPs due to their fast electron transfer and less dissolution and aggregation.44–46 As a result, these low Pt content materials significantly decrease the cost of catalysts. It is an effective method to realize practical applications.

For Pt-free catalysts, N-doped carbon (N–C) is one of the most extensively investigated candidates for the ORR. Compared to the pure C material, the doping of N could change the spin and charge density of the C structure, which will benefit O2 adsorption and then enhance the ORR performance.47,48Fig. 4a shows a typical N–C material with four types of N species including pyridinic N (∼398.6 eV), pyrrolic N (∼400.5 eV), graphitic N (∼401.4 eV), and pyridinic N+–O− (∼402 to 405 eV).49 Liu et al. confirmed the descending electrocatalytic activity order: pyridinic N > pyrrolic N > graphitic N > pyridinic N+–O− according to experiments and calculations.50 However, different N species of a N–C material usually coexist. It is hard to determine the specific contribution of each N configuration. Therefore, identifying the real active site of the N–C material is still a challenge.51,52 In 2010, Liu et al. constructed a graphitic N doped mesoporous C array with a template method, which has an Eonset of −0.12 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 0.1 M KOH.53 Rao et al. confirmed that CNTs with more pyridinic N (8.4 atom%) sites exhibit good catalytic activity with an Eonset of 0.455 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 0.5 M H2SO4.54 In 2012, Lai et al. found that graphitic N determines the jL, while pyridinic N dominates the Eonset through pyrolyzing the precursor with different N species.55 Similarly, Deng et al. demonstrated that a N–C material with more pyridinic N and graphitic N does exhibit excellent ORR performance with an E1/2 of 0.84 V (vs. RHE) in 1.0 M NaOH.56 Additionally, Ning et al. confirmed the synergistic effect of pyridinic N and graphitic N on the ORR.57 In contrast, Luo et al. prepared edge-rich pyridinic and pyrrolic N doped C, recently, which has an E1/2 of 0.853 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH.58 Particularly, Guo et al. designed a N–C material through Ar+ etching and found that pyridinic N will produce active sites in acid and C atoms surrounding the pyridinic N are real active sites due to Lewis basicity.52 More recently, Wang et al. confirmed the synergistic effect of pyridinic N doped C and the vacancy defects on the ORR performance.59 Therefore, the active site of the N–C material for the ORR is still under debate.

In addition, M–N–C materials also exhibit relatively high performance and long-term stability for the ORR.60 The M–N–C material represents a kind of material with metal atoms supported on N–C. Particularly, the existence of the M-coordinated N structure (M–Nx) will further enhance the catalytic activity of the ORR. Fig. 4b displays a M–N–C material with highly dispersed M–N4 sites. Both the kind of metal (M = Co, Fe, Ni, Cu, etc.) and the configuration of N (pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N, etc.) have great effects on the ORR performance.61 The coordination environment of M (such as MN4–C10, MN4–C12, MN4–C8, etc.) also affects the ORR performance.62 Usually, the Fe–N–C material shows relatively higher ORR performance than the Co–N–C material.18,63 Chen et al. prepared an Fe–N–C material with an E1/2 of 0.93 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH, which outperforms commercial Pt/C.64 However, the poor durability of Fe-based materials greatly limits their practical application in PEMFCs.65 This is because the dissolved Fe catalyst in acid solution will react with the generated H2O2, which is named the Fenton reaction (eqn (10) and (11)).23 The generated OH and OOH radicals could damage the ionomer, membrane, and catalysts and then result in the degradation of the performance.66,67 In addition, the oxidation of carbon at high potential is also a nonignorable factor, which will lead to the damage of Fe–Nx structures.65 In contrast, the Co–N–C catalyst has initiated Fenton reactions with encouraging performance and durability. Thus, the preparation of efficient Co–N–C catalysts has become a hotspot.23 Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + OH− + HO˙(10) Fe3+ + H2O2 → Fe2+ + H+ + HOO˙(11)
In summary, both low Pt and Pt-free catalysts have been extensively studied recently to enhance the catalytic activity of the ORR and reduce the whole cost of catalysts (Fig. 5). As for low Pt catalysts, the CoPt alloy was prepared to regulate the d-band center and ΔEO, which is related to the ORR. Furthermore, core–shell Co/Pt was obtained to further decrease the content of Pt. More recently, structurally ordered intermetallic CoPt/Pt was prepared to further improve the catalytic activity.68 This kind of material is currently one of the best low Pt-based catalysts with an E1/2 of 0.96 V in acid.41 The corresponding mass activity of CoPt/Pt is 0.56 A mgPt−1 at the beginning and remains at 0.45 A mgPt−1 after 30000 cycles, meeting the 2020 DOE target of both activity (0.44 A mgPt−1) and durability (<40% loss). As for Pt-free catalysts, different kinds of Co–N–C materials were designed and developed. First, both experimental and theoretical results confirm that the Co nanoparticle encapsulated N–C material exhibits enhanced ORR activity and stability.69 Recently, a single atom-based Co–N4–C material also exhibited excellent ORR activity due to its high intrinsic activity. More recently, Co–N2+2–C was synthesized derived from surfactant-assisted metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and has more desirable ORR activity and thermodynamically favorable 4e ORR pathway compared to Co–N4–C.70 Co–N2+2–C shows an E1/2 of 0.84 V (vs. RHE) in acid and has a power density of 0.87 W cm−2 in H2–O2 fuel cells. However, the durability of the Co–N2+2–C material still remains a great challenge especially at high voltages.

3. Co–N–C electrocatalysts for the ORR
To replace Pt catalysts, earth-abundant materials especially Co–N–C attracted wide attention. The origin of the Co–N–C electrocatalyst could be dated back to 1964. Jasinski R. demonstrated the good ORR performance of a Co-coordinated N4 phthalocyanine complex in alkaline media.75 Actually, M-coordinated N4 molecules are widely found in enzyme systems in nature for O2 activation. For example, cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is a typical enzyme used in nature for the ORR. CcO contains two crucial parts: an iron porphyrin structure and a copper center. CcO could accept and donate electrons to O2. Then, O2 was reduced to H2O on CcO with the participation of protons. It is noted that the core structure of CcO is a metal-coordinated N4 complex porphyrin (Fig. 6a). This structure could provide a stable coordination environment and stabilize high-valent metal ions. In addition, the molecule can be modified with different functional groups to tune the activity of the complex.26 Therefore, porphyrin molecules are widely used not only in nature but also in catalysis. However, the activity of the M–N4 complex is not good enough for practical applications, especially in acid.

Recently, the M–N4 complex has been used as an active site to construct hybrid materials. For Co-based compounds, Zhang et al. prepared a cobalt porphyrin functionalized carbon nanotube (CNT) through covalent connection (Fig. 6b).71 The resulting material exhibits an n of 4, which demonstrates that covalently linking electrocatalytically active molecules on CNTs is helpful. The Co corrole is also an M–N4 complex, which has been widely used for the electrocatalytic ORR.76 Meng et al. constructed a Co corrole covalently connected CNT via azide–alkyne cycloaddition, which exhibits a selective 4e− ORR (Fig. 6c).72 This hybrid catalyst also exhibits excellent O2 and H2 evolution reaction (OER and HER) performance.77 More recently, Xie et al. constructed a 3D self-supported electrode by covalently linking Co corrole molecules onto Fe3O4 nanoarrays grown on a Ti mesh (Fig. 6d).73 Linking porphyrin molecules with covalent bonds to prepare a porphyrin covalent organic framework (COF) is also an effective strategy.78 The COF was first proposed by Omar M. Yaghi in 2005.79 Porphyrin COFs are a class of COFs.80 Recently, Li et al. fabricated Co porphyrin COF coated CNTs, named the CNT@POF hybrid.74 The Co porphyrin molecules were covalently connected to benzene (Fig. 6e). The SEM image, TEM image and XRD pattern confirm the formation of the CNT@POF hybrid with a thin POF layer (∼4 nm) encapsulating the CNT (Fig. 6f–h). In addition, 2D graphene has been selected as the conductive building unit.81 Zhao et al. constructed a Co porphyrin COF on 2D graphene, which exhibits the best catalytic ORR activity with an E1/2 of 0.81 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH compared to other metals (Mn, Fe, Zn, etc.).82 Tang et al. proposed a layer-by-layer assembly technique to realize the construction of Co porphyrin multilayers on graphene nanosheets.83 MOFs made of porphyrins have also been investigated for the ORR. For example, Lions et al. reported a Co tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (Co-TCPP) based MOF with a 4e process measured in 0.1 M H2SO4 mixed with carbon black.84 Zhong et al. synthesized a 2D conjugated MOF linked with Co bis(dihydroxy) complexes (Co-O4), which shows an E1/2 of 0.83 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH mixed with CNTs.85 As a result, both grafting molecular catalysts on a carbon support and constructing COFs and MOFs to realize heterogeneous molecular catalysis are efficient strategies to improve the ORR performance and stability.
Due to the diversity of M-coordinated N4 molecules such as phthalocyanine, porphyrins and corroles and their derivatives, the long-term stability of these molecules in acid is still a great challenge. However, pyrolyze Co-coordinated N4 molecules together with conductive carbons could enhance the stability. In 1978, Andrusyova et al. prepared many Co–N–C materials by calcining Co sources (such as phthalocyanine, tetraphenylporphyrin, etc.) and carbon sources (such as active carbon) together at high temperature (>800 °C).86 The obtained Co–N–C material does exhibit good activity and stability in acid. However, the cost of synthesis of M-coordinated N4 molecule precursors is very high. Therefore, lots of Co–N–C materials were prepared by pyrolyzing precursors containing Co, N, and C sources directly. On the one hand, the Co, N, and C sources can be different precursors, which are further mixed during the preparation of catalysts. For example, the Co source is a transition metal salt such as Co(NO3)2 and CoCl2. For the N and C sources, they can be any compounds that consist of both N and C atoms (such as melamine, N-doped graphene, etc.). The N and C sources can also be urea and carbon black, respectively. In this work, a Co–Nx active site is created in situ when pyrolyzing the mixture. On the other hand, the precursor could be a Co complex that contains Co, N and C atoms such as the cheap vitamin B12 (VB12) and Co COFs. When using such Co complexes, the Co–Nx active sites already exist in pre-catalysts and just need simple modification, such as pyrolysis. The N atom is selected to refine the surface chemistry and electronic structure of the C support.87,88 The introduction of the C support will improve the conductivity of the Co–N–C material.
Many kinds of Co–N–C materials with different morphologies including 1D, 2D, and 3D morphologies were synthesized. On the one hand, the final morphology is determined by the morphology of the precursor. On the other hand, the calcination condition also has a great effect on the formation of the final morphology. Liang et al. synthesized Co,N-doped chiral carbonaceous nanotubes (CCNTs) with a Co salt and 1D polypyrrole as the precursors (Fig. 7a).89 The ununiform charge distribution of the helical structure of the CCNTs is beneficial to the adsorption and the distribution of Co atoms on the curved surface. The morphology and structure of L–CCNTs–Co are shown in Fig. 7b and c. Recently, Yang et al. constructed a self-supporting Co-doped CNT film, named Co/CNFs, by pyrolyzing Co foil and melamine under N2. The Co/CNFs prepared at 1000 °C exhibits an E1/2 of 0.896 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH.92 It has been reported that the melamine usually forms CNTs under high-temperature calcination.93–95 As a conductive material, 1D CNTs have been widely applied as the source of C due to their high conductivity. Zheng et al. synthesized a Co–N–C catalyst with molecule-level Co-coordinated graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) supported on a CNT (Co–C3N4/CNT).96 The 2D g-C3N4 material, which contains N and C simultaneously, was widely designated as the N and C precursors. Yang et al. synthesized a 2D Co–N–C material by calcining g-C3N4 and a Co salt (Fig. 7d),90 while the surfactant Pluronic F127 (PEO100–PPO65–PEO100) was selected to homogenously disperse Co ions. Finally, a material containing Co single atom active sites dispersed in N-doped graphene, named CoN4/NG, was obtained (Fig. 7e and f). CoN4/NG exhibits an E1/2 of 0.87 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH. Compared to g-C3N4, 2D graphene possesses more exposed surface area. Jiang et al. synthesized a 2D Co–N–C material with Co(NO3)2 as the Co source, polypyrrole as the N source, and graphene as the C source.97 The N source could also be polyethyleneimine.98 All these 2D catalysts have more exposed active sites, but they easily stack together, which causes poor mass transfer in catalysis. Compared to 2D materials, 3D materials have hierarchical structures with improved mass transfer.45 Tang et al. synthesized 3D hierarchical Co–Nx–C by direct calcination of Co(NO3)2, melamine, amylopectin, and in situ formed Mg(OH)2 nanosheet templates.99 It is the scaffold of the 2D MgO template that leads to the formation of a 3D hierarchical framework during the carbonization process. Luo et al. synthesized a series of Co–N–C catalysts, named Co@CoNC–X, by one-step pyrolysis of nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and different dosages of CoCl2 (Fig. 7g).91 In particular, 3D hierarchical Co@CoNC-3 had a coralline-like morphology and exhibited an E1/2 of 0.82 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH (Fig. 7h–j). The performance of Co@CoNC-3 is not good enough, which may be ascribed to the small Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area (216.78 m2 g−1). Therefore, an increase the surface area will result in more exposed active sites and then enhance the ORR activity for the same kind of catalyst.

In order to increase the surface area of Co–N–C materials, templating methods were introduced. Liang et al. prepared a mesoporous Co–N–C material using VB12 as the Co, N, and C precursor, and SiO2 NPs (∼20 nm), silica SBA-15, and montmorillonite (MMT, 2D) as the hard template.100 Morphology characterization of final Co–N–C materials demonstrates that hard templates copied the morphology and induced the formation of a porous structure (Fig. 8a–c). The Co–N–C material prepared with VB12/SiO2 shows the largest BET surface area (568 m2 g−1) compared to that of VB12/SBA-15 (387 m2 g−1) and VB12/MMT (239 m2 g−1) (Fig. 8d–f). The mesoporous structure results in an increased BET surface area. The Co–N–C material prepared with VB12/SiO2 exhibits an E1/2 of 0.79 V (vs. RHE) (Fig. 8g) and n of 3.95 in 0.5 M H2SO4 (Fig. 8h). Furthermore, the ORR performance of these materials increases with the increase of the BET surface area, which is attributed to the increased active sites and enhanced mass transfer (Fig. 8i). The advantage of this strategy is that the shape and structure of the hard template govern the final shape and structure of the catalyst. Recently, Han et al. constructed a hollow Co–N–C material with SiO2 spheres as the template.101 Polystyrene (PS) spheres were also used as a hard template to construct hollow or porous Co–N–C materials.102,103 Therefore, the templating strategy is very effective in synthesizing hollow or porous Co–N–C materials. The hollow or porous structure will not only increase the exposed active sites but also enhance the mass transfer, which are beneficial for the catalytic ORR. Therefore, the use of Co, N, and C precursors to prepare Co–N–C materials at high temperature is simple and convenient. However, the disadvantage of this method is the poor control of the morphology of catalysts during the pyrolysis. The real active site of Co–N–C prepared using this strategy is also hard to determine due to the complex surrounding environment of metal atoms. Therefore, selecting the precursor with a clear Co–N coordination environment is a reliable and promising strategy to construct active Co–Nx species of resulting Co–N–C catalysts.

In addition to direct pyrolysis of Co, N and C sources, the Co–N–C material could also be obtained by calcining COFs and MOFs, which contain Co, N and C elements.106 On the one hand, metal atoms of COF and MOF precursors have an accurate coordination environment, which is useful to determine real active sites, even though the crystal structure of the precursor may collapse during the calcining process. On the other hand, COFs and MOFs have a high surface area and controllable porous structures, which will afford more exposed active sites and enhance mass transfer. Recently, Xiang et al. constructed a Co–N–C material through pyrolyzing a Co-based COF (Fig. 9a).104 The Co-based COF was obtained by C–C coupling of Co porphyrin monomers. The Co could also be replaced by Fe and Mn in this work.

MOFs, which are made by linking inorganic and organic units through strong coordination bonds, are easy to prepare compared to COFs/COPs.107 It is well known that there are many types of MOFs.108 MOFs have lots of advantages including a large surface area, adjustable pore structure, easily heteroatom introduction, and controllable morphology.109 Lots of Co-based MOFs with different morphologies (1D, 2D, 3D etc.) have been reported and applied as precursors. The zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) is one of the most important MOFs.110 For example, the 3D ZIF-67 dodecahedron, which is constructed with Co and 2-methylimidazole in methanol, has attracted wide attention.111 Ni et al. prepared a 3D Co–N–C material by pyrolyzing a mixture of a small amount of ZIF-67 and commercial carbon black (Vulcan XC72).112 Yin et al. prepared a Co–N–C material based on the calcination of bimetallic Zn/Co ZIF-67 (Fig. 9b).105 The introduction of Zn will result in the uniform distribution of Co single atoms due to the evaporation of Zn atoms at a relatively high temperature (>907 °C). TEM and STEM images proved the formation of Co single atoms in the N–C framework (Fig. 9c and d). The resulting Co–N–C materials have an E1/2 of 0.881 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH. More recently, Wang et al. also obtained a Co–N–C-1100 catalyst by pyrolyzing Zn/Co ZIF-67 at 1100 °C, which showed an E1/2 of 0.80 V (vs. RHE) in 0.5 M H2SO4.113 Therefore, single atom Co–N–C materials have outstanding catalytic activity due to the boosted intrinsic activity.114 Unlike single atom Co-based N–C materials, N-doped CNT materials with encapsulated Co NPs have attracted wide attention. Xia et al. manufactured an N-doped CNT framework (NCNTF) obtained from ZIF-67 through calcination under H2.115 Co NPs will catalyze the formation of N-doped CNTs. The NCNTF exhibits an E1/2 of 0.87 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH. Correspondingly, Meng et al. introduced a general approach to obtain this kind of Co NP-encapsulated N-doped CNT (N–CNT) (Fig. 9e).69 The N–CNTs derived from ZIF-67 have a similar morphology compared to NCNTFs (Fig. 9f and g). The N–CNTs show an E1/2 of 0.85 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH. The encapsulation of Co NPs in N–CNTs could enhance the ORR performance, which is ascribed to the electronic synergy of Co and N–CNTs (Fig. 9h). Theoretical calculation demonstrates that the Co NP encapsulated N–CNTs could increase the density of states, decrease the work function and then enhance the ORR performance.69 Furthermore, metal NP encapsulated N–CNTs will prevent the aggregation of NPs and the fall off of metal active sites and exhibit long-term stability. Besides 3D ZIF-67, 2D leaf-like ZIF-L (Co) has also been applied to prepare Co-based catalysts.116,117 Different from ZIF-67, ZIF-L was synthesized with a dual solvent (methanol and water) system.118,119 For example, Wang et al. synthesized a 2D Co–N–CNT material derived from Zn/Co ZIF-L. The resulting Co–N–CNTs exhibit an E1/2 of 0.90 V in 0.1 M KOH and is one of the best catalysts reported.120 In addition, 1D MOF-derived Co–N–C materials have also been prepared due to their fast electron transfer. For example, Zou et al. obtained a super-long 1D Co–MOF-74 nanotube derived Co–N–C material.121 Therefore, Co-based MOFs with different morphologies have been applied as the precursors to design and prepare single-atom Co-based materials or Co NP encapsulated CNT catalysts to boost the intrinsic catalytic activity.
Despite the great success of MOF-derived M–N–C materials, there are still some drawbacks of these MOF-derived catalysts: (1) the inherent properties of the microporous dominant structure of the MOF precursor, (2) the irreversible aggregation effect of metal NPs and (3) the effective regulation of structural evolution during the pyrolysis process. These drawbacks greatly hindered their ORR activity. In order to overcome these disadvantages, many strategies have been proposed to promote the research of nanostructured M–N–C materials, including mesoporous, microporous, hollow, and multidimensional (MD) structures.
In 2016, Shang et al. introduced a mesoporous SiO2 layer on a ZIF. After calcination, the Co–N–C electrocatalyst is confined in a limited space, while the mesopores provide the channels that connect the inner space and the outer environment (Fig. 10a). The Co,N-doped C framework (Co,N–CNF) has hierarchical porous structures confirmed from the TEM image (Fig. 10b).122 A similar strategy has also been applied to prepare Co,N-doped CNTs with hollow structures.124 The advantage of this strategy is that mesoporous or hollow structures could be obtained for enhanced mass transfer. However, the disadvantage of this strategy is the relatively complicated preparation process, which normally involves more than two steps. Liang et al. demonstrated a polymer-assisted calcination method to prepare meso/microporous Co–N–C materials in two steps.125 Porous P–ZIF-67 was first prepared by adding polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in the crystallization process of ZIF-67 (Fig. 10c and c1). Porous P–Co–NC materials were obtained by pyrolysis (Fig. 10d). Furthermore, the meso/microporous structures could be regulated with the amount of PVP. The microporous structure could provide more active cites, while the mesoporous structure could enhance mass transfer. Therefore, adjusting porous structures will result in the optimum activity. P–Co–NC-4 exhibits the best ORR performance due to the largest surface area with meso/microporous structures (Fig. 10e). Recently, Zhang et al. constructed a Co–N–C material using a phenolic resin-assisted strategy.126 Co–N–C has mesopores and macropores with more exposed active sites and a shorter mass diffusion distance. Co–N–C has an E1/2 of 0.87 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH. More recently, He et al. reported a novel surfactant-assisted MOF confined carbonization method to prepare a core–shell Co–N–C material with improved single atom CoN4 active sites (Fig. 10f–h).70 The F127 assisted Co–N–C@F127 exhibits the best ORR performance with an E1/2 of 0.84 V (vs. RHE) in 0.5 M H2SO4 compared to other surfactant (such as PVP and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cetyltrimethylammonium ammonium bromide (CTAB)) assisted Co–N–C materials (Fig. 10i). Therefore, surfactant-assisted MOF calcination is a very effective method to improve the catalytic activity. On the one hand, these Co–N–C materials have an improved BET surface area with more porous structures, which is helpful to the mass transfer. On the other hand, an obvious interfacial structure was observed between the MOF and surfactant during the pyrolysis process, which is favorable to the catalytic activity.

In order to obtain a more novel structure and morphology of MOF-derived Co–N–C materials, MOFs can also be used as building units to construct multidimensional (MD) materials. For example, Zou et al. constructed a branch-like hierarchical Co–N–C material, named the N/Co-doped CNT supported nanofiber (NCo@CNT–NF) (Fig. 11a and b).121 The NCo@CNT–NF was obtained by pyrolyzing a 1D Co–MOF-74 nanotube in the presence of dicyandiamide (DCDA). The NCo@CNT–NF calcined at 700 °C shows an E1/2 of 0.861 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH (Fig. 11c). Recently, Li et al. built a Co-based N–C material through pyrolyzing a MOF supported on a 2D CoAl layered double hydroxide (LDH) at 800 °C, named LDH@ZIF-67-800 (Fig. 11d–f).127 This strategy could be extended to prepare other related electrocatalysts due to the diversity of LDHs and MOFs. Amiinu et al. constructed a Co–Nx/C material by pyrolyzing MOFs grown on Ti foil.129 The Co–N–C material could also be constructed based on a 3D support such as carbon cloth etc.130 Jia et al. created a 3D Co–N–C material through calcining MOFs coated on a 3D melamine sponge (MS) substrate (Fig. 11g–i).128 These MD materials have enhanced mass transfer and excellent conductivity with enhanced electrocatalytic activity.

Recently, a lot of work has been dedicated to preparing Co–N–C materials using MOFs as the precursor. The real active site has been considered to be a typical structure of Co–N4 (Fig. 12a). Experimentally, the CoN4 active site has been evidenced by aberration-corrected STEM coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), etc.90,132,133 Theoretically, the calculation also confirms that the Co–N4 species has the best ORR performance compared to the Co–N3C, Co–N2C2, and Co–NC3 species.134 However, He et al. proposed an active site of a new Co–N2+2 structure derived from surfactant-assisted MOFs (Fig. 12b).70 The carbon-shell confinement strategy leads to the formation of more Co–N2+2 species. The thermodynamic free energy change of OOH*, O*, and OH* intermediates of Co–N4 and Co–N2+2 for a typical 4e− ORR pathway was calculated (Fig. 12c). The result demonstrates that the Co–N2+2 structure is thermodynamically favorable for the 4e− ORR than Co–N4. Furthermore, the activation energy of the OOH dissociation reaction for Co–N2+2 is 0.69 eV, which is lower than that of the Co–N4 active site (1.11 eV). The breaking process of the O–O bond on the Co–N2+2 active site is shown in Fig. 12d. The initially adsorbed OOH intermediate on the Co active site will dissociate into co-adsorbed O and OH intermediates on the Co atom. An Fe–N2+2 active site was also reported in the Fe–N–C material.62 Recently, Xiao et al. obtained a Co–N–C material with binuclear Co2N5 active sites derived from MOFs.131 The aberration-corrected STEM images and the XAS measurement demonstrate the formation of the Co2N5 active site (Fig. 12e–h). The obtained Co–N–C material with Co2N5 structures exhibits a better mass activity than that with Co–N4 species and Co NP structures (Fig. 12i). More recently, Yang et al. investigated the catalytic activity of Co–N4−x–Cx (x = 0–4) and demonstrated the synergistic effect of defects and N in regulating the active site.135 Thus, the surrounding coordination environment of metallic Co atoms could affect the activity and selectivity of the ORR during the catalytic process. Above all, great progress has been made in designing Co–Nx–Cy materials for the ORR. All of these strategies are designed to increase active sites or/and improve intrinsic activities.

4. Co–M–N–C electrocatalysts for the ORR
In addition to monometallic Co–N–C catalysts, bimetallic N–C materials were also constructed. The bimetallic Co–M–N–C system exhibits much better ORR performance than the Co–N–C material. This is mainly because the alloying can regulate the electronic structures of materials to reach a suitable binding energy for O2.138 For example, a Co–Fe–N–C material was synthesized through direct calcination of Co(NO3)2, FeCl3, polyaniline (PANI), and C, named PANI–CoFe–C.139 In addition, bimetallic Co-based N–C materials could also be obtained by pyrolyzing a MOF precursor with two different metals. Fang et al. obtained hollow FeCo–N-doped porous C (FeCo–NPC) with a cubic morphology based on a PCN-224–FeCo MOF (Fig. 13a and b).136 FeCo–NPC exhibits the best catalytic activity compared to Fe– and Co–NPC due to the synergetic effect of FeNx and CoNx active sites (Fig. 13c and d). Similarly, Xiong et al. constructed a Co–Fe-based N–C material with uniformly distributed alloy NPs and an E1/2 of 0.89 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M NaOH.140 According to the “volcano plot” of the activity vs. ΔEO of the ORR, transition metal Cu should have relatively high electrocatalytic activity (Fig. 2b). Therefore, a bimetallic CoCu-based N–C material was constructed. Kuang et al. manufactured a Cu, Co-embedded N–C catalyst by crystallizing ZIF-67 NPs on Cu(OH)2 nanowires (Fig. 13e).137 Then, the Cu(OH)2–ZIF-67 precursor was pyrolyzed in two steps at 400 °C and 800 °C to obtain Cu@ZIF-67 and CuCo@NC, respectively. The TEM image of the resulting CuCo@NC demonstrated the formation of CuCo NPs (15–25 nm) (Fig. 13f). In addition, CuCo@NC also has a much larger BET surface area (698 m2 g−1) than Co@NC (265 m2 g−1) (Fig. 13g). The resulting CuCo@NC has an E1/2 of 0.884 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH. Huo et al. synthesized a 2D leaf-like CuCo@NC material with Cu(OH)2 and ZIF-L as the precursor.117 More recently, Xu et al. synthesized a 2D NiCo@NC material based on the calcination of core–shell NiCo–MOF-5@ZIF-L(Zn). The NiCo@NC material has an E1/2 of 0.866 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH.116

Recently, dual-atom-based actives sites have also attracted wide attention. For example, Xiao et al. obtained an Fe–Co dual-atom N–C material (FeCoNx/C), which exhibits an enhanced catalytic activity with an E1/2 of 0.86 V (vs. RHE) in acid compared to that of CoNx/C and FeNx/C.141 Wang et al. prepared a hollow dual-metal (Fe, Co)–N–C material with an E1/2 of 0.863 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 HClO4.142 Theoretical calculation confirmed that the Fe–Co dual-metal sites are beneficial for the activation of O–O and the 4e process. More recently, Liu et al. demonstrated an S-doped Zn, Co dual-atom-based N–C material (Zn,Co–Nx–C–Sy) with an E1/2 of 0.893 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH.143 Lu et al. also prepared a Zn–Co atomic pair doped N–C material (Zn/CoN–C) with outstanding catalytic activity in both alkaline (E1/2 = 0.861 V vs. RHE) and acidic (E1/2 = 0.796 V vs. RHE) media due to the enhanced binding of O2.144 As a result, the improved electrocatalytic activity of the Co–M–N–C catalyst is due chiefly to the alloying effect and synergetic effect between Co and other metals.
5. Co–X–N–C electrocatalysts for the ORR
As mentioned, the doping of N into C materials will improve the catalytic activity of the ORR.147 In addition to N–C, C materials doped with other heteroatoms including B, S and P have also been extensively investigated.14 It should be noted that not only the nature, such as the configuration and electronegativity, of heteroatoms affects the ORR performance, but the concentration of dopants also plays a crucial role.148 In general, heteroatom doping with different electronegativities will mainly influence the charge or/and spin density of the resulting materials.149 Both electron-rich N and electron-deficient B (the electronegativity of C, N and B atoms is 2.55, 3.04, and 2.04, respectively) could promote the adsorption of O2 and then enhance the ORR performance.150 For example, Jiao et al. found that all the nonmetallic element (B, N, P, O, and S) doped graphene materials exhibit enhanced ORR performance compared to pure graphene confirmed by experimental and theoretical results.151 In addition, He et al. found that the introduction of the surfactant F127 into ZIF-67 derived Co–N–C will greatly increase the N content from 6.1 to 9.1 atom%.70 Furthermore, the concentration of N-doped C will increase from 3.6 to 6.8 atom% with additional doping of B and the resulting B, N-codoped C exhibits better ORR performance than N–C.152 Recent efforts also confirmed that the multi-doping strategy could further enhance the catalytic activity for the ORR. Zhang et al. demonstrated that an N,P-codoped C network has the best ORR performance compared to N-doped C and P-doped C due to the minimum overpotential.153 When a heteroatom, such as S, is doped, the ORR performance in acid is greatly improved.154,155 In addition, the doping of heteroatoms will introduce defect structures.59,156,157 For example, Li et al. found that an N-modified S-defect structure has excellent ORR performance in acid (Fig. 14a and b).145 Theoretical calculation demonstrates that the N,S-codoped defect structure decreases the free-energy of intermediates (Fig. 14c). Mun et al. found that the introduction of S could control carbon plane electron-withdrawing properties and decrease the d-band center of Fe, and then improve the ORR by lowering the adsorption energies of intermediates.158 Jiang et al. also confirmed the beneficial effect of heteroatom doping with high exothermic O2 chemisorption for the ORR in acid through theoretical calculation.159 A heteroatom B-doped C material has also been investigated to understand the intrinsic mechanism of enhancement in the ORR.160 More recently, Guo et al. synthesized a Co,N,B-doped C nanosheet (Co–N,B–CS) with a soft template method.146 The Co–N,B–CSs have macropores of 30–50 nm in size and atomic-scale Co atoms (Fig. 14d–f). The introduction of B atoms could promote O2 adsorption around the Co–Nx sites and lead to an E1/2 of 0.83 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH (Fig. 14g).146 In addition to binary doping, Meng et al. indicated that N,O,S-codoped C exhibits an outstanding ORR performance with an E1/2 of 0.74 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH.161 Yang et al. obtained N,O,S-codoped C, which contains 6.66 atom% N, 1.73 atom% S and 6.29 atom% O, with an E1/2 of 0.75 V (vs. RHE) in acid.162 The N, S, F-codoped C also has outstanding ORR performance in both acidic and alkaline media.163 As a result, multi-heteroatom doping will further improve the ORR performance.149 Therefore, the development of multidoped C materials is a promising field in the future.

In addition, transition metal oxides, phosphides, chalcogenides etc. were also reported for the electrocatalytic ORR.166 The study of Co3O4 for the ORR could be dated back to 2011. Liang et al. obtained an N-doped graphene supported Co3O4 NP (∼5 nm) material, which exhibits an E1/2 of 0.83 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH.167 Ji et al. synthesized a Co3O4 hollow NP with rich oxygen vacancies through the Kirkendall effect (Fig. 15a and b).164 The optimized Co3O4−x exhibits an E1/2 of 0.834 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH. Recently, Lin et al. prepared a core–shell CoP encapsulated defective carbon (DC) NP supported on an N–C material (Fig. 15c).165 The interfacial charge redistribution caused by the core–shell CoP@DC contributed to the ORR activity. As a Co1−xS-based catalyst for the ORR, Wang et al. synthesized a Co1−xS/graphene composite catalyst.168 Qiao et al. embedded Co1−xS hollow nanospheres on N,S-doped graphene (Co1−xS/NSG), which exhibits further enhanced activity (E1/2 = 0.863 V vs. RHE, 0.1 M KOH).169 Although the ORR activity of the above metal compounds is not as high as that of ideal electrocatalysts, they show reasonable OER performance. Therefore, these compounds are relatively good bifunctional catalysts for both the OER and the ORR and can be applied in metal–air batteries.

6. Comparison of ORR and PEMFC activity
To further understand the research status of Co-based ORR catalysts, their ORR and PEMFC performance are summarized in Tables 1–3. The Eonset, E1/2, specific activity and mass activity of Co–Pt-based electrocatalysts are listed in Table 1. It is found that the ordered core–shell CoPt exhibits the best ORR activity with an E1/2 of 0.96 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M HClO4.41 Furthermore, the corresponding mass activity is 2.26 A mg−1, which is greatly larger than that of the US DOE 2020 target for Pt-based catalysts (0.44 A mgPt−1). In addition, most of the Co–Pt-based catalysts exhibit excellent mass activity compared to the DOE target.

As for Pt-free Co-based catalysts, some valuable information such as the Eonset, E1/2, open-cell voltage, and maximum power density of Co-based ORR catalysts tested in factual PEMFCs is listed in Table 2. Overall, Co–N–C@F127 shows the best activity with an E1/2 of 0.84 V (vs. RHE) in 0.5 M H2SO4.70 The corresponding maximum power density is 0.87 W cm−2. Furthermore, the bimetal-based (Fe,Co)/N–C material has an E1/2 of 0.863 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M HClO4, which is 100 mV smaller than that of the best Co–Pt-based material (E1/2 = 0.96 V vs. RHE).142 The corresponding maximum power density is 0.98 W cm−2, which is still far less than that of Co–Pt-based materials in a real MEA. In addition, the stability of the MEA for the Co–N–C material remains still a challenge.
The ORR performance for Co-based electrocatalysts in alkaline media was also summarized and is listed in Table 3. In recent years, lots of Co-based electrocatalysts have been developed and designed. The best Co–N–C material exhibits an E1/2 of 0.90 V (vs. RHE) 0.1 M KOH, while the best dual-metal (Fe,Co)/CNT material exhibits an E1/2 of 0.954 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH. In summary, Co-based precious metal materials and single atom-based Co–N–C materials have relatively high catalytic activity due to the high intrinsic activity of precious metals or single atoms. In addition, micro/mesoporous Co–N–C catalysts have outstanding catalytic ORR activity, which is attributed to increased active sites and enhanced mass transfer. However, the catalytic activity of Co-based materials in acid is relatively poor compared to that in alkaline media. This could be attributed to the higher overpotential required for the redox reaction (O2/O2−) in acid (1.53 V at pH = 0) than that in alkaline media (0.7 V at pH = 14) thermodynamically.184 In addition, the selectivity of H2O2 production caused by the binding strength of H2O2 on the metal centers at different pH values also plays a key role in the kinetics of the ORR.185 Therefore, facilitating the adsorption of O2 and dissociation of O–O in acid and suppressing the generation of H2O2 through regulating the electronic structure of metal centers are possible strategies to enhance the ORR performance.186 As described above, the preparation of Co–N–C materials with desirable activity and long-term stability in acid is still an enormous challenge.
7. Conclusion and prospects
Although the related research has shown gratifying progress, the mission of preparation of electrocatalytic catalysts with admirable activity, super stability, and low price has not been completed. Low Pt content and Pt-free catalysts are medium- and long-term solutions to the large-scale commercial application of PEMFCs, but their activity and stability still need to be further enhanced. In this review, recent advances in CoPt-based and Pt-free catalysts for the ORR were summarized from the aspects of the structure, morphology, and activity. CoPt-based catalysts with different morphologies and compositions were discussed. Among them, a core–shell CoPt-based intermetallic catalyst displays an outstanding activity and durability. For Pt-free catalysts, three types of Co-based materials were summarized including Co–N–C materials, Co–M–N–C materials (M = Cu, Fe, Ni, etc.), and Co–X–N–C materials (X = B, S, etc.). Particularly, the preparation method, the structure characterization and the activity evaluation of Co–N–C materials were systematically summarized. Firstly, a Co–N–C material can be obtained by pyrolyzing a mixture of Co, N, and C sources at high temperature with or without a surfactant. Secondly, the calcination of precursors such as MOFs and COFs that contain Co, N and C elements is another efficient strategy. Due to the inherent limitations of MOFs such as the microporous dominant structure and the irreversible aggregation of metal NPs, several strategies were proposed to boost the catalytic activity including the introduction of silica, polymers, and surfactants. Thirdly, other transition metal doped Co–N–C materials are widely attractive due to the synergic effect between Co and the other metal, such as Fe and Cu. Fourthly, non-metal heteroatom S and B-doped Co–N–C materials exhibit enhanced ORR activity in acid. Finally, Co-based oxides, phosphides, and chalcogenides were also briefly discussed due to their excellent bifunctional ORR/OER activity. Overall, single atom-based Co–N–C materials seem to be more competitive than other traditional metal particulate catalysts, mainly because single atom-based catalysts are relatively active and, in some cases, have acid resistance.
In general, more detailed and in-depth study is still required to make full use of Co–N–C materials in PEMFCs. Therefore, further efforts may be focused on the following areas:
(1) For CoPt-based catalysts, the structure, the morphology, the atomic ratio and the addition of other transition metals should be investigated systematically to optimize the ORR activity.
(2) Understanding the relationship between synthesis conditions (such as the precursor, temperature, acid leaching, etc.) and final structure (such as the size, morphology, composition, etc.) is very important to further guide the preparation of Co–N–C materials.
(3) The development of new strategies is needed to enhance the catalytic activity of Co–N–C materials, especially in acid.
(4) Advanced ex situ and in situ characterization techniques (e.g. aberration corrected STEM and X-ray absorption fine structure) should be applied to study the relationship between the structure and performance, clarify the real active center, and understand the degradation mechanism of electrocatalysts.
