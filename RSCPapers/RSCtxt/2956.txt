    , Accepted 24th January 2022First published on 26th January 2022AbstractThe concentration-caused quenching (CCQ) effect seriously deteriorates the photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of 0D organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites but reasonable management of CCQ via accurate structural design strategies remains a formidable challenge for PL property optimization. Herein, by fine-tuning the geometric configurations of organic cations, a controllable PL quenching-activation switch is realized by accurately modulating the CCQ effect. Specifically, we rationally designed a couple of 0D antimony halides, namely [BPP]SbCl5 (BPP = 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)-propane) and [BPPP]SbCl5 (BPPP = 1,3-bis(4-piperidyl)-propane), based on the same [SbCl5]2− units. Through purposive structural regulation from the closely confined [BPP]2+ to the incompact [BPPP]2+ matrix, the concentration of the fluorescent [SbCl5]2− species and the CCQ effect were notably diminished, which significantly promoted the localization degree of the photoelectrons. Hence, [BPPP]SbCl5 displays enhanced broadband yellow light emission with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 79.57%, while [BPP]SbCl5 is completely non-luminescent. In addition, by virtue of the PL inactivation–activation conversion in the superfast assembly process from SbCl3 to [BPPP]SbCl5, secret information encrypted by an invisible printed SbCl3 pattern can be rapidly decrypted by the light-emissive [BPPP]SbCl5 under the trigger of an organic precursor, which showcases the potential in confidential information encryption–decryption technology.
1. Introduction
In the past several decades, three-dimensional (3D) lead halide perovskite quantum dot (PQD) technology has attracted immense interest in the field of light emitting diodes owing to its facile assembly process, high defect-tolerance, tunable band gap, emission across the entire visible spectrum, narrow full width at half maximum (FHWH), wide color gamut (∼150% NTSC) and ultrahigh photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY).1–3 However, these new-generation optoelectronic materials also unavoidably confront the notorious aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect, that is, the fluorescence weakens in the aggregated state due to the self-quenching effect of adjacent quantum dots.4 In recent years, substantial endeavors have been undertaken to mitigate this harmful effect by encapsulating the PQDs within pores/cages of various porous polymeric, inorganic or coordination complex frameworks. In these composites, porous materials serve as robust structural templates to guide the confined growth of perovskite nanoparticles and keep them isolated from each other, that is, perovskite nanoparticles are highly dispersed in the cavities of porous matrices. Benefitting from the adequate dispersion effect in these matrix materials, the PQDs acting as fluorescence species are highly confined and the ACQ effect is significantly diminished, giving rise to stable PL performance.5–17 However, these complicated and time-consuming modulation strategies readily destroy the PQD structure, decrease the production yield, sacrifice the luminescent efficiency, and are incapable of fundamentally preventing the ACQ effect and luminescent quenching. Therefore, it is significant and imperative to explore more favorable assembly approaches and prepare new kinds of perovskite materials with highly efficient and stable photoluminescence (PL) performance via a rational structural design strategy from the molecular level.
Recently, bulk zero-dimensional (0D) hybrid perovskites have emerged as promising candidates to replace conventional 3D PQDs due to their multiple structural advantages and superior properties.18–20 Indeed, more versatile organic cations and metal centers can be utilized as building blocks endowing 0D perovskites with more tailorable and diversified structures as well as tunable PL performance.21 In the structures of 0D perovskites, discrete metal halide clusters or polyhedrons acting as nanostructured luminescent centers periodically embed in the wide bandgap organic matrix, which enables 0D perovskites to display the individual photophysical properties of the metal halide units.22 At the same time, the bulk organic components not only separate the fluorescence centers to diminish the ACQ effect but also provide an internal quantum confinement effect to localize the photo-induced electrons. As a result, even without any further confinement or protection management, bulk 0D perovskite intrinsically prevents the aggregation of nanostructured luminescent centers resulting in higher optical stabilities than colloid 3D PQDs. Functionally speaking, 0D hybrid perovskites are inclined to display stronger Stokes shift broadband light emissions with generally longer lifetimes arising from self-trapped excitons (STEs).23 These unique advantages render 0D perovskites a variety of new applications complementary to the solar cells and narrow emitters of 3D PNCs, such as solid-state lighting, X-ray scintillation, remote thermometry, and single-component white light emitting diodes.24–26
Despite the intrinsic confinement effect of organic matrix toward discrete metal halide units, the concentration of luminescence species plays a crucial role in the PLQYs of 0D perovskites. Specifically, too high a concentration of fluorescence species, that is to say, a shorter distance between them, readily leads to luminescence deterioration, termed as concentration caused quenching (CCQ) effect. This phenomenon has been confirmed in some 0D hybrid halides and metal doped inorganic phosphors.27,28 For example, a low concentration of [MnX4]2− tetrahedrons in 0D Mn2+-halides reduces the coupling interactions and energy transfer between neighboring [MnX4]2− centers, thereby boosting the emission efficiency.29,30 In addition, previously reported works have demonstrated that low concentration of metal halide centers significantly results in highly localized photoelectrons, which promotes the formation of electron–hole polarons and STEs, in turn improving the PLQY.31–33 Hence, reducing the concentration of luminescent species to diminish the CCQ effect and promoting photoelectron localization is pivotal for the realization of high PLQYs in 0D perovskites. However, a rational structural design approach has not yet been shown to accurately manage the CCQ effect to improve the PLQY of 0D perovskite, and this engineering far lags behind the conventional 3D PQD up to date. Undoubtedly, implementing this project will not only provide an in-depth understanding of the optimizing mechanism of PLQY but also paves a new way to rationally design high-performance 0D perovskites.
In view of this significance, we focus on 0D hybrid lead-free antimony halide perovskites to realize rational optimization of PLQY considering the multiple advantages of non-toxicity, high stability, and luminescence efficiency. In this work, we report a new structural design strategy toward 0D perovskites, that is, rational fine-tuning the organic matrix to modulate the concentration and photoelectron localization degree of luminescent species. To demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy, we utilize two analogous organic amines of [BPP]2+ and [BPPP]2+ as cations and construct a couple of 0D antimony perovskites based on the same [SbCl5]2− units. The planar pyridine ring in [BPP]2+ results in a closely confined matrix with a higher concentration of [SbCl5]2− species, while the chair configuration of the piperidine ring in [BPPP]2+ significantly increases the distance and weakens the electronic interaction between the neighboring [SbCl5]2− units, which results in highly localized photo-induced carriers. Therefore, [BPPP]SbCl5 displays enhanced light emission with a high PLQY of 79.57% compared with non-luminescent [BPP]SbCl5.

Then, the solution was transferred and sealed in a 25 mL glass reactor, and then heated at a constant temperature of 80 °C for at least 5 days and cooled to room temperature with a controlled cooling rate of 5 °C min−1. The colorless plate-like crystals were collected by filtration and determined to be [BPPP]SbCl5 (C13N2H28SbCl5) by single-crystal XRD.

2.3 X-Ray crystallography
The single crystal data of [BPP]SbCl5 and [BPPP]SbCl5 were collected on a Bruker Apex II CCD diffractometer with Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at room temperature. The crystal structures were solved by direct method and refined based on F2 using the SHELXTL-2018 program. All the non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters, and hydrogen atoms of organic molecules were positioned geometrically and refined isotropically. Structural refinement parameters of compounds [BPP]SbCl5 and [BPPP]SbCl5 are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†), and important bond parameters are listed in Table S3–S6 (ESI†).
2.4 Characterizations

2.4.1 Powder X-ray diffraction. 
The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis was performed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE powder X-ray diffractometer equipped with copper Kα radiation at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. The diffraction patterns were scanned over the angular range of 5–60° (2θ) with a step size of 5° min−1 at room temperature. The simulated powder pattern was calculated by Mercury software using the crystallographic file from the single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment.


2.4.2 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements. 
The morphology observation and elemental mapping were conducted by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss Merlin Compact).


2.4.3 Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). 
The thermal stability was tested using the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which was carried out on a Mettler TGA/SDTA 851 thermal analyzer in the temperature range of 30–800 °C under the constant protection of N2 atmosphere flow.


2.4.4 Absorption spectrum measurements. 
The solid state UV-vis absorption optical spectrum for powder samples was collected at PE Lambda 900 UV/Vis spectrophotometer at room temperature in a wavelength range of 200–800 nm with BaSO4 serving as a reference standard.

The Raman measurement was performed on powder samples in the range of 0–3500 cm−1 by using Horiba Scientific LabRam HR Evolution under 365 nm excitation wavelength.

2.5 Photoluminescence property characterization
The PL spectrum was performed on an Edinburgh FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was achieved by incorporating an integrating sphere into the FLS980 spectrofluorometer. The PLQY was calculated based on the equation: ηQE = IS/(ER − ES), in which IS represents the luminescence emission spectrum of the sample, ER is the spectrum of the excitation light from the empty integrated sphere (without the sample), and ES is the excitation spectrum for exciting the sample. The time-resolved decay data were carried out using the Edinburgh FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer with a picosecond pulsed diode laser. The average lifetime was obtained by exponential fitting. The corresponding Commission Internationale Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates are calculated based on the emission spectrum.
2.6 Application characterization

2.6.1 Preparation of [BPPP]SbCl5 film. 
0.30 g sample powder was dissolved in 1 mL of ethanol (EA) to obtain a homogeneous suspension, and 0.5 g polyethylene pyrrolidone (PVP) was then placed into the above solution and stirred at room temperature for 4 h to produce a light green viscous liquid. To prepare the film, a small amount of the viscous liquid was taken and spun on a spinner at a speed of 2100 rap min−1; then, a thin [BPPP]SbCl5 film was obtained.


2.6.2 Fabrication of white LED lamp. 
The white LED lamp device was fabricated by combining a 365 nm UV LED chip with the yellow phosphor [BPPP]SbCl5 and the commercial BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ blue phosphor. Yellow phosphor [BPPP]SbCl5 and blue phosphor BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ were mixed with epoxy resin and stirred continuously for 10 min. Then, the mixture was coated on the surface of the UV LED chip and cured for 30 min under vacuum conditions. The optical properties of the fabricated WLEDs were evaluated by a temperature-programmed LED optoelectronic analyzer with an integrating sphere (EVERFINE HAAS-2000).


2.6.3 Anti-counterfeiting application of luminescent inks. 
The anti-counterfeiting printing experiments were performed on a self-modified HP inkjet printer (HP-1112) with an empty cartridge. 0.5 g of [BPPP]SbCl5 sample was dissolved in 10 mL of methanol solution to prepare a luminescent ink solution with a concentration of 50 mg mL−1. Then, 6 mL of [BPPP]SbCl5 ink solution was loaded into the empty cartridge, and then the cartridge was loaded into the printer. After printing and drying for 2 min at room temperature, bright yellow light emission was observed with the preset information under UV light. In addition, the anti-counterfeiting information can also be written with a brush dipped in luminescent inks.


2.6.4 Information encryption and decryption. 
0.2 mol L−1 SbCl3 ethanol solution was used as fluorescent ink to print the designed information for encryption. For the liquid decryption process, the printed substrate with SbCl3 patterns was loaded with [BPPP]Cl2-ethanol (0.2 mol L−1) solution by a sprayer. After drying in an ambient atmosphere for 5 min, the patterns showed clearly bright yellow emission under UV light illumination. For the solid phase decryption process, the information extraction can be achieved simply by grinding or erasing [BPPP]Cl2 powder with the printed substrate.

2.7 Theoretical band calculation
The single crystal data of compounds [BPP]SbCl5 and [BPPP]SbCl5 were directly used to calculate the electronic band structure in Castep software. The total energy was calculated with density functional theory (DFT) using Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation. The interactions between the ionic cores and the electrons were described by the norm-conserving pseudopotential. Hence, the C-2s22p2, N-2s22p3, H-1s1, Sb-5s25p3, and Cl-3s2sp5 orbitals were adopted as valence electrons. The number of plane waves included in the basis sets was determined by a cutoff energy of 320 eV, and numerical integration of the Brillouin zone is performed using Monkhorst–Pack k-point sampling of 2 × 2 × 2. Other calculating parameters and convergence criteria were set by the default values of the CASTEP code.
3. Results and discussion
Single crystals of [BPP]SbCl5 and [BPPP]SbCl5 were prepared through a wet-chemistry solution from the precursor materials of organic amines and SbCl3. Despite the similar chemical compositions, this couple of 0D perovskites display distinct PL properties. Under the irradiation of 365 nm UV lamp, [BPP]SbCl5 is completely non-luminescent while [BPPP]SbCl5 gives bright yellow light (Fig. 1i and j). Subsequently, we performed single crystal X-ray diffraction to study their structures, aiming to elucidate the distinctive PL activities. Both their crystal structures contain discrete tetragonal pyramidal [SbCl5]2− anions charge balanced by [BPP]2+ and [BPPP]2+ cations, respectively (Fig. 1e and f). All the [SbCl5]2− anions acting as luminescent species are periodically dispersive in the insulating organic matrix fixed by abundant weak hydrogen bonds (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). The most distinctive characteristics of the two perovskites are the different separation distances between the neighboring [SbCl5]2− units derived from the confinement effects of organic matrices. The [BPP]2+ cations contain planar pyridine ring and feature close stacking with the nearest distance of about 5.7 Å, while the chair configuration of piperidine ring results in longer separation of about 9.8 Å between neighboring [BPPP]2+ cations (Fig. 1c and d). As a result, the [SbCl5]2− units are closely confined with the nearest Sb⋯Cl and Sb⋯Sb bonds of 3.342 Å and 5.707 Å in [BPP]SbCl5, respectively, while these values reach up to 7.048 Å and 8.215 Å in [BPPP]SbCl5 (Fig. 1g and h). Thus, lower concentrations of luminescent species in [BPPP]SbCl5 weaken the electronic interaction between neighboring [SbCl5]2−, which results in enhanced emission efficiency compared with non-luminescent [BPP]SbCl5.
 Fig. 1  Structural assembly scheme of [BPP]SbCl5 and [BPPP]SbCl5: structures of the [SbCl5]2− units (a and b), packing modes of [BPP]2+ (c) and [BPPP]2+ cations (d), structures of [BPP]SbCl5 (e) and [BPPP]SbCl5 (f), arrangement of [SbCl5]2− in [BPP]SbCl5 (g) and [BPPP]SbCl5 (h), photo images of crystals under ambient light and UV lamp irradiation (365 nm) for [BPP]SbCl5 (i) and [BPPP]SbCl5 (j). 
To get better insight into the distinctive PL activities, optical and electronic transition characteristics are also performed. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, [BPP]SbCl5 displays a steep absorption edge at about 450 nm with a direct band gap of 2.8 eV, while [BPPP]SbCl5 gives two strong absorption peaks at 237 nm and 297 nm as well as one weak peak at 355 nm, which can be attributed to the electronic transitions between sp excited states and s2 ground state.34 The cut-off wavelength of about 500 nm gives a band gap of 2.58 eV for [BPPP]SbCl5. First-principle calculations were further performed to investigate the electronic band structures in order to probe the underlying fundamental reason. As shown in the density of states, both the top of valence bands are derived from Cl-3p states and Sb-5s or 5p states, and the bottom of conduction bands are contributed by Cl-3p or Sb-5s states as well as C/N-2p states of organic cations (Fig. 2c and d). Hence, the optical performances of [BPP]SbCl5 and [BPPP]SbCl5 mainly stem from the electron transition occurring in inorganic species accompanied by inter-electron transition within organic components. Electronic band structures indicate that both conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) of the two compounds are located at the same symmetry points indicating direct band gaps of 2.5 and 2.3 eV, which are slightly smaller than the results obtained from UV-vis absorption spectra. Detailed examinations indicate that the frontier orbitals of [BPP]SbCl5 display large dispersion demonstrating strong electronic coupling between neighboring [SbCl5]2− blocks (Fig. 2e). Generally, the large dispersive bands are composed of highly non-localized electron states, which are disadvantageous to form bound excitons.35 Differently, both the CBM and VBM of [BPPP]SbCl5 are much less dispersive than [BPP]SbCl5 due to a longer distance and weaker electronic interaction between adjacent [SbCl5]2− species, which indicates that the electrons are highly localized on the isolated [SbCl5]2− units (Fig. 2f). The partial densities on LUMO and HOMO also show more localized electrons in [BPPP]SbCl5 (Fig. 2g and h). Significantly, the more-flat frontier bands in [BPPP]SbCl5 promote the charge localization degree and enhance the effective hole- and electron-masses, which promotes the formation of electron–hole polarons and further enhances the emission efficiency. This achievement successfully demonstrates the feasibility of improving the PLQYs of 0D perovskites through rationally modulating the concentration of metal halide species and photoelectron localization degree. In the following discussion, we mainly study the PL property and optoelectronic applications of [BPPP]SbCl5 due to strong luminescence.
 Fig. 2  The UV absorption spectra (a and b), calculated density of states (c and d), band structures (e and f), and electron maps of LUMO and HOMO (g and h) for [BPP]SbCl5 (up) and [BPPP]SbCl5 (down). 
The purity and chemical composition of bulk [BPPP]SbCl5 crystal are confirmed by the PXRD pattern, EDX analysis, and elemental mapping images (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†). PL excitation (PLE) spectrum of [BPPP]SbCl5 shows two dominant peaks at 280 nm and 368 nm approximately, corresponding to the absorption spectrum. Upon the 368 nm UV light excitation, [BPPP]SbCl5 displays strong broadband yellow light emission spanning the entire visible spectra with maximum peak at 610 nm, large Stokes shift of 242 nm, and wide full-width at half-maximum (FWHM = 131 nm) (Fig. 3a). To quantitatively evaluate the emission intensity, PLQY was measured to be 79.57%, which is in the top rank of values in all 0D Sb3+ perovskites (Fig. S5 and Table S1, ESI†).36–41 Based on the PL emission spectrum, CIE chromaticity coordinates are calculated to be (0.53, 0.44), corresponding to a light yellow color resembling most of the 0D Sb3+ perovskites (Fig. 3b).42–44 To reveal the photophysical process, time-resolved PL spectrum monitoring at 610 nm was performed and fitted by a biexponential function giving an average lifetime of 5.078 μs and 5.978 μs at 300 K and 80 K, respectively (Fig. 3c).

The broadband excitation and emission spectra compel us to investigate the wavelength-dependent spectroscopy to confirm the PL nature. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), emission wavelength-dependent excitation spectra show a negligible change in spectral profiles and peaks. Similarly, excitation wavelength dependent emission spectra are also unchanged, suggesting that the emission originates from the relaxation of the identical excited state. Thus, only one dominant emission center emerges in the 3D PL/PLE correlation map (Fig. S7, ESI†). In addition, one weak emission peak emerged at about 467 nm that belongs to the electron transition within organic cations (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI†). Considering the fact that broadband light emissions of some semiconducting materials derive from the surface defect, we further compare the emission spectra of bulk and microscale crystals to rule out the possibility of surface defect derived broadband light emission, which is susceptible to particle size and particle aggregation (Fig. S10 and S11, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3d, the identical spectral profiles and slightly decreased emission intensity indicate that the broadband light emission belongs to the intrinsic property but not the defect generated emission.45,46 As an added verification, excitation power dependent PL emission intensity is further performed, and the linear dependence further demonstrates that this broadband light emission belongs to the intrinsic bulk effect (Fig. 3e). Overall, combined large Stokes shift, wide FWHM, and long PL lifetime demonstrate that this intrinsic broadband yellow light emission can be provisionally ascribed to radiative recombination of self-trapped excitons (STEs).
To further probe the PL mechanism, the temperature-dependent emission spectra were performed from 300 to 80 K (Fig. 3f). Along with decreasing temperature, there is no emission splitting phenomenon indicating the single radiative mechanism. However, the maximum emission wavelength slightly red shifts from 610 to 634 nm in the cooling process. Generally, temperature induced emission peak shift is attributed to the synergistic effects of thermal expansion (TE) and electron–phonon (EP) interaction.47 Using the one-oscillator model and assuming a linear relationship between thermal expansion and temperature, the evolution of the emission energy with temperature Eg(T) can be fitted according to the following model:  where E0 is the unrenormalized band gap, ATE and AEP are the weight of TE and EP interactions, respectively, hω is the average optical phonon energy, and kB is Boltzmann's constant. As shown in Fig. 3g, the TE interaction weakens with decreasing temperature, which leads to the narrowing of energy levels between the conduction and valence bands, consequently reducing the band gap. Therefore, the slight red shift of emission energy is mainly contributed by the TE interaction. The emission intensity gradually increases due to the weakening of thermally activated non-radiative decay in the cooling process. Temperature-dependent emission intensities are fitted by the Arrhenius-type model giving activation energy of 39.044 meV, which is larger than the thermal energy (26 meV) of free excitons at room temperature, illustrating that stable STEs could be produced to restrain thermal quenching (Fig. 3h).48 At the same time, the emission FWHM narrows significantly along with decreasing temperature due to the enhanced electron–phonon coupling, which can be evaluated by fitting temperature-dependent FWHM according to the following model:  where Γ0 is the FWHM at 0 K, ELO represents the energy of the longitudinal-optical phonon, Eb is t average binding energy of the trap states, Γphonon and Γinhomo represent the relative contributions of electron–phonon coupling and trapped state induced inhomogeneous broadening, respectively.49 The best fitting indicates the broadband emission is mainly contributed by the electron–phonon coupling (Γphonon of 65 meV) (Fig. 3i). Additionally, the calculated phonon energy ELO of 19.0 meV perfectly corresponds to the Sb–Cl stretching frequency (132 cm−1) from the Raman spectrum, which further verifies strong electron–phonon interaction in [SbCl5]2− octahedron (Fig. S12, ESI†). Together, these systematical characterizations reinforce the electron–phonon coupling in the deformable 0D crystal lattice and further confirm the STE nature of broadband emission, which can also be termed as triplet emissions of excitons localized on the Sb3+ ions. Based on the Seitz model, free Sb3+ ion with 5s2 electron configuration has singlet electronic ground state termed as 1S0, and 5s5p orbitals split into four nondegenerate states of 1P1, 3P0, 3P1, and 3P2 levels as excited states due to Coulomb and exchange interactions (Fig. 4a).23 Upon photo excitation, induced electrons motivate promptly from 1P1 excited states to 3Pn (n = 0, 1, 2) levels through intersystem crossing (ISC) forming STEs, which eventually gives rise to broadband yellow light emission (Fig. 4b).

Apart from the compelling broadband light emission property, it is noteworthy that [BPPP]SbCl5 also possesses sufficient structural and spectral stabilities in various extreme environments. TGA result shows that [BPPP]SbCl5 can be stable over 200 °C, which is also proved by the unchanged temperature-dependent PXRD patterns (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†). Considering the chemical instability of perovskite, we soak [BPPP]SbCl5 crystals in various organic solvents, such as ethanol, acetone, acetonitrile, and dichloromethane. After immersion over 24 h, the crystal structure and PL emission spectrum remain unchanged without obvious structural collapse and luminescent quenching phenomenon (Fig. S15 and S16, ESI†). In addition, [BPPP]SbCl5 also features sufficient stability in a humid environment verified by unchanged PXRD patterns and PL emission spectrum after storing in a moist atmosphere (>90% humidity) over one month (Fig. S17 and S18, ESI†). Overall, the strong protective effect of the organic matrix enables 0D [BPPP]SbCl5 to successfully provide the ACQ phenomenon with higher air- and moisture resistance as well as thermal stability than conventional 3D PQDs.
The highly efficient and stable luminescent property of [BPPP]SbCl5 encourages us to explore the potential in various optoelectronic applications. As a down-conversion broadband yellow phosphor, a white LED device is firstly fabricated by coating a mixture of [BPPP]SbCl5 and commercial blue phosphor of BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ on a UV chip (365 nm). As shown in Fig. S19 (ESI†), the fabricated white LED gives bright white light with a correlated color temperature of 6945 K, high CRI of 90.1, and CIE color coordinates of (0.31, 0.33) close to natural sunlight. With currents increasing from 20 to 120 mA, the emission intensity steadily increases without energy transfer between the two phosphors, indicating the potential application in high-power optoelectronic devices. Subsequently, by facilely blending [BPPP]SbCl5 and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) in ethanol, the [BPPP]SbCl5-PVP composite was prepared and the film is then deposited by one-step spin-coating from the precursor solution. The deposited [BPPP]SbCl5-based film features a high crystallization degree and gives identical broadband yellow light emission (Fig. S20, ESI†). Benefiting from the great mechanical treatment characteristics, a series of designed luminescent patterns based on [BPPP]SbCl5 is directly printed on commercial paper using a facile screen printing technology. As illustrated in Fig. S21 (ESI†), the invisible pattern under ambient light appears clearly as a yellow color under UV light irradiation, showcasing the application in luminescent anti-counterfeiting technology.
The above achievement inspires us to further explore more confidential applications of [BPPP]SbCl5 in data protection, such as information encryption–decryption. In the conventional fluorescent anti-fake methods, the information is directly encrypted by invisible luminescent materials, but these straightforward emission characteristics can be easily mimicked by simply utilizing some substitutes or mixing different fluorescent materials, which reduces the security level of luminescence anti-counterfeiting technology. Herein, we develop a facile controllable PL off/on switch realizing confidential information encryption–decryption process by virtue of the significant conversion from non-luminescent precursor material to luminescent hybrid perovskite. As shown in Fig. 5, through the facile laser inkjet-printing method by using SbCl3-EtOH solution as luminescent ink, a designated pattern is printed on the surface of commercial paper after deposition of SbCl3 from ethanol solution. Hence, the information is encrypted by the completely invisible SbCl3 pattern irrespective of ambient and UV light irradiation. Subsequently, [BPPP]Cl2-EtOH solution is loaded on the surface of the SbCl3 substrate by a sprayer giving rise to nanostructured [BPPP]SbCl5 on the designated pattern. After ethanol evaporation, the crystallized [BPPP]SbCl5 pattern with bright yellow color appears clearly under UV light irradiation, which gives the cryptographic information (Fig. 5a). In addition, the ultra-fast and facile assembly process of [BPPP]SbCl5 provides another synthetic feasibility of solvent-free mechanochemical solid-phase reaction between SbCl3 and [BPPP]Cl2 salts. As shown in Fig. S22–S24 (ESI†), the slight grinding of mixed [BPPP]Cl2 and SbCl3 easily generates [BPPP]SbCl5 with identical crystal structure and broadband yellow light emission verified by the same PXRD pattern and PL emission spectrum, respectively. Hence, solid-state [BPPP]Cl2 salt can be directly scribbled or pressed on the surface of the SbCl3 pattern to form [BPPP]SbCl5, also realizing the same information decryption process (Fig. 5b). Compared to conventional luminescent anti-counterfeiting methods, this controllable PL off/on switch process is more desirable for high-security-level information encryption–decryption technology.50–55

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated here the rational management of CCQ effect as a design strategy to rationally optimize the PL performance of 0D hybrid perovskites. By fine-tuning the geometrical configurations of organic cations, we successfully control the concentration of fluorescence species and regulate the photoelectron localization degree, thus realizing controllable PL quenching-activation switch in a couple of 0D hybrid antimony perovskites. Specifically, by diminishing CCQ effect and enhancing photoelectron localization degree, indiscernible PLQY of non-luminescent [BPP]SbCl5 significantly increased up to 79.57% for [BPPP]SbCl5. The highly efficient and stable luminescent performance, facile assembly process, and excellent machinability enable 0D [BPPP]SbCl5 as an excellent candidate in white light LED, luminescent anti-counterfeiting, and confidential information encryption–decryption technology. Our finding provides a unique structural platform to highlight the photoelectron localization degree in the regulation of luminescent efficiency, which paves a new way to rationally optimize the PL performance through reasonable structural design strategy at the molecular level.
