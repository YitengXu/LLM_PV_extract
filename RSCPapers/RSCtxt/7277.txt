1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn great attention due to their key advantages of synthetic variability, light weight, low cost, large area roll to roll fabrication and the lucrative possibility of direct integration into flexible devices.1–5 Currently, the photoactive layer of the most efficient PSCs is a bulk blend composed of an electron-accepting fullerene derivative and an electron-donating conjugated polymer (CP).6–10 In order to optimize the overall performance of PSCs, the CPs should have a narrow band gap for efficient solar energy harvesting,11 a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to maximize the open circuit voltage (Voc),12 and a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level that is appropriately offset above the acceptor's LUMO to drive charge separation while minimizing energy loss.13 In addition, the charge carrier mobility and morphology of the active layer are also crucial elements limiting the efficiency of PSCs.14,15 Recently the synthesis of the CPs by alternating electron-rich and electron-poor moieties along the backbone has emerged as an effective way to tune the optical and electronic properties of the CPs.15,16 Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) is one of the successful electron deficient units used in CPs as an electron donor for PSCs.12,15–28 The strong electron deficient character of DPP allows the synthesis of materials that absorb in the near infrared and show ambipolar charge transport in organic field effect transistors with good mobilities for holes and electrons.29–32 5-Membered rings are preferred for the substitutions at the 3- and 6-positions of the DPP unit because they alleviate steric hindrance and extend the effective conjugation length through increased coplanarity. Substitution of the thiophene with furan flanking the DPP core was firstly reported in 2010 by Fréchet et al.20 Inserting furan moieties into the backbone of the CPs with a DPP core enables the use of shorter side chains because of the significant contribution of the furan rings to the overall polymer solubility in common organic solvents. The PSCs based on furan-containing DPP copolymers and PC71BM showed a PCE of 5.0%. Subsequently, the Fréchet group used long linear alkyl side chains as alternatives to branched side chains on furan-containing DPP copolymers to promote nanostructural order in thin-film solar cells and they obtained a PCE of 6.5%.24 These findings indicate the potential of furan moieties in the design of polymer donors for efficient organic photovoltaic applications. However, generating suitable thin film morphologies of DPP copolymer:PC71BMs blend requires the use of an additive or a solvent mixture in order to obtain high performance PSCs.20,24,26,27
In this contribution, we present a furan-flanked DPP copolymer, poly{3,6-difuran-2-yl-2,5-di(2-octyldodecyl)-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-altthienylenevinylene} (PDVF-8), and highlight the improvement of the PCE of PSCs based on PDVF-8 as an electron donor via solvent additive and methanol treatment (MT). Fig. 1 shows the chemical structure of PDVF-8, the device configuration of the PSCs based on PDVF-8 and PC71BM and the energy level alignment of the materials used in the PSCs. Yu et al. reported that a PDVF-8 thin film has strong dual-band absorptions at 784 nm accompanied by a shoulder peak at 724 nm.33 The HOMO level versus the vacuum level of the PDVF-8 thin film is 5.34 eV, obtained from cyclic voltammetry.33 Similar to many high-performance donor polymers, the PDVF-8 thin film mainly takes a face-on orientation related to substrates because the (100) and (010) peaks could be clearly found in grazing incident X-ray scattering out-of-plane patterns with π–π stacking distances of 3.95 Å.33 These properties imply that the PDVF-8 is a promising polymer donor for efficient PSCs. An ideal morphology for high performance photovoltaic devices requires nanoscale phase separation with a bicontinuous interpenetrating network, which does not only provide a large interface area between the electron donor and acceptor materials for efficient exciton dissociation but also offers continuous pathways for more direct and quicker charge transportation to the corresponding electrodes so as to reduce charge recombination within the photoactive layer. Herein we investigated the effect of solvent additives (1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN)) and methanol treatment (MT) on the phase separation of the PDVF-8:PC71BM thin film using atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), TEM-energy dispersive spectroscopy (TEM-EDS) and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling in details.

2. Experimental details
2.1 Sample preparation
The synthesis procedure of PDVF-8 can be found in ref. 33. PC71BM was purchased from the American Dye Source, Inc (USA). To prepare the PDVF-8:PC71BM (1:3, weight ratio) blend, the PDVF-8 and PC71BM were dissolved in three solvent systems (i) CF, (ii) CF with a small amount of DIO (1, 3 and 5 vol%) and (iii) CF with a small amount of CN (1, 3 and 5 vol%).
2.2 Device fabrication
ITO-patterned glass substrates were consecutively cleaned with acetone and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath. The surfaces of the glass substrates were modified by UV–ozone treatment for 20 minutes. A 35 nm thick PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP Al 4083) layer was spin-coated onto the cleaned ITO-patterned glass substrates, followed by annealing in air at 110 °C for 30 minutes under ambient conditions. The PDVF-8:PC71BM blend solution was spin-coated onto the surface of the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a 100 nm thick film in the nitrogen-filled glove box. Then top surfaces of the blend films were treated by spin-coating methanol at 2000 rpm as illustrated in Fig. 1d. Finally, LiF (0.6 nm) and Al (100 nm) were successively deposited by thermal evaporation under a high vacuum (1 × 10−4 pa) onto the surface of the active layer. All devices have an active area of 2.0 × 2.0 mm2.
2.3 Measurements and characterizations
Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured under a N2 atmosphere in the glove box by using a Keithley 2400 under illumination and in the dark. Solar cell performance was tested under a 1 sun, AM1.5G full spectrum solar simulator (Photo Emission Tech. Inc., model #SS50AAA-GB) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard silicon photovoltaic traced to the National Institute of Metrology, China. Space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements were explored in device configurations of (a) ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDVF-8:PC71BM/MoOx/Al for the hole-only device and (b) ITO/Al/LiF/PDVF-8:PC71BM/LiF/Al for the electron-only device. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using a Q Test Station 2000 (Crowntech Inc., USA) at room temperature in air.
AFM images were measured with an S II Nanonaviprobe station 300 HV (Seiko, Japan) in taping mode. TEM images and TEM-EDS mapping images were measured using JEM-2100F (JEOL, Japan).
XPS experiments were carried out using a VG Scienta R3000 spectrometer in an ultrahigh vacuum with a base pressure of 2 × 10−10 mbar. The measurement chamber was equipped with a monochromatic Al (Kα) X-ray source providing photons of 1486.6 eV. The 70 nm PDVF-8:PC71BM film was etched using an ion source (ISE5, Omicron Nano Tech. GmbH). S 2p and C 1s XPS spectra were measured after every etching with a time gap of 4 min.
3. Results and discussion
In order to highlight the effect of the solvent additives on the performance of the PSCs as shown in Fig. 1b, the PDVF-8:PC71BM (1:3) thin film was spin-coated from CF, CF + 3% DIO or CF + 3% CN solution, respectively. We named the above 3 devices from the various solvent/solvent mixture as Devices 1, 3 and 5, respectively. To further investigate the MT on the performance of the PSCs, the PDVF-8:PC71BM thin films from CF, CF + 3% DIO and CF + 3% CN were treated by methanol so that Devices 2, 4 and 6 were obtained. Fig. 2a presents current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the above six PSCs under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The open circuit (Voc), short circuit (Jsc), fill factor (FF), power conversion efficiency (PCE), series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) derived from Fig. 2a are summarized in Table 1. It is apparent that the photovoltaic performance of Device 1 is bad due to the CF used as a solvent of the active layer. The PCE of Device 2 is still below 1% because the MT only slightly improved the Jsc, Voc and FF. However when a small amount of DIO or CN was added into the CF solution for the PDVF-8:PC71BM, the performance of the PSCs was greatly enhanced, as shown in Fig. 2a. Three concentrations (1 vol%, 3 vol% and 5 vol%) of DIO or CN have been tried in the solvent mixture with CF (Fig. S1 and S2†). The results demonstrated that even 1 vol% DIO could give rise to an increase in the PCE from 0.79% to 3.17% (Table S1†). The addition of 3 vol% and 5 vol% DIO could improve the PCE to 3.73% and 3.47%, respectively. Therefore, 3 vol% is regarded as an optimized concentration of DIO. Similarly, the addition of 3 vol% CN, as an optimized concentration, resulted in a PCE of 4.26% (Table S2†). After the surface of the PDVF-8:PC71BM film spin-coated from CF + 3 vol% CN was further treated by methanol, the PCE of Device 6 reached 4.69% as shown in Table 1. Because only 3 vol% DIO or 3 vol% CN in CF is involved, we simplify the CF solution with 3 vol% DIO or 3 vol% CN as CF + DIO or CF + CN in the following descriptions. In order to ensure the validity and repeatability of the data, we measured at least 20 pixels (size = 2 × 2 mm2) for each device configuration. The average PCE values of Devices 1–6 are 0.73%, 0.89%, 3.69%, 3.91%, 4.18% and 4.59%, respectively. Table 1 also presents the series resistances (Rs) and shunt resistances (Rsh) of the devices obtained from the slopes of J–V curves at Voc and Jsc, respectively (Fig. 2a). Compared to the only-CF devices (Devices 1 and 2), a decrease of Rs and an increase of Rsh are apparent when an additive (DIO or CN) was utilized in the solution of the active layer. MT can further change the resistances. Jsc and FF increases of the devices (Devices 3–6) with an additive (DIO or CN) are attributed to the resistance changes. In addition, the electrical leakage for the devices with an additive is suppressed because Devices 3–6 have higher rectification ratios at ±1 V than the only-CF devices (Fig. S3†). It indicates that the solvent additives and/or MT can improve the diode quality and FF value. In order to detect a discrepancy in Jsc, which can easily lead to an overvalued PCE,34 external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of Devices 1–6 from 300 nm to 900 nm were measured and are shown in Fig. 2b. The Jsc values calculated from the integration of the EQE spectra of Devices 1–6 are 2.69, 2.93, 9.05, 9.82, 10.35 and 11.05 mA cm−2, respectively, which closely match Jsc = 2.9 mA cm−2 for Device 1 (ca. 7.2% error), Jsc = 3.1 mA cm−2 for Device 2 (ca. 5.5% error), Jsc = 9.73 mA cm−2 for Device 3 (ca. 7.0% error), Jsc = 10.3 mA cm−2 for Device 4 (ca. 4.7% error), Jsc = 10.89 mA cm−2 for Device 5 (ca. 5.0% error) and Jsc = 11.64 mA cm−2 for Device 6 (ca. 5.1% error), obtained from J–V characteristics under illumination. It means that the Jsc values measured for the PSCs are reliable and PCE values presented in this manuscript are not overvalued.

Compared to the only-CF devices, the devices with DIO or CN show higher FF values, as listed in Table 1. This implies that the solvent additive effectively improved the charge transport ability. In order to confirm that the solvent additive and MT not only enhance the electron and hole transport but also facilitate a balance of the electron and hole transport in the PSCs, the mobilities of the electrons and holes were measured in the electron-only and hole-only devices using a space charge limited current (SCLC) method (details and parameters in Fig. S4a and b†). The mobilities of the electrons and holes measured by the SCLC method are also listed in Table 1. The mobilities of the electrons and holes in the CF devices are 2.72 × 10−4 and 1.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. When the solvent additives were used, electron mobilities were slightly increased while hole mobilities were increased one order of magnitude. As a result, hole mobilities in the CF + DIO and CF + CN devices were 8.89 × 10−5 and 1.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. It is worth noting that MT further increased the mobilities of the electrons and holes in all the devices. More importantly a perfect mobility balance of holes and electrons was achieved in the CF + DIO and CF + CN devices treated by methanol.
The enhanced Jsc and higher FF in the CF + DIO or CF + CN devices imply the formation of well-connected percolated networks for each of the phase-separated components (donor and acceptor). To gain an insight into the relation between phase separation in the PDVF-8:PC71BM blend film and the device performance, morphologies of the PDVF-8:PC71BM films spin-coated from CF, CF + DIO and CF + CN were investigated using AFM and TEM. Fig. 3 shows the surface morphologies obtained by AFM, measured at ambient conditions, where a1–f1 are height images and a2–f2 are phase images. The surfaces of PDVF-8:PC71BM films from CF are quite rough due to a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 12.6 nm for the film without MT (Fig. 3a) and a roughness of 11.62 nm for the film with MT (Fig. 3b). Both Fig. 3a and b exhibit coarse cobblestone-like phase separations with large microscale domains which are consistent with observations in other DPP-polymers:PC71BM blend films from only CF35,36 and chlorobenzene (CB).20 However the surfaces of the PDVF-8:PC71BM films spin-coated from CF + DIO or CF + CN become much smoother and more homogeneous, as shown in Fig. 3c–f. Apparently aggregations were significantly suppressed by adding DIO or CN into the CF. The surface roughness of the PDVF-8:PC71BM film from CF + DIO is 1.28 nm in Fig. 3c. When the surface of the PDVF-8:PC71BM film from CF + DIO is treated by methanol, the RMS roughness becomes 1.03 nm in Fig. 3d. When using CF + CN as a solvent, the surface roughness of the PDVF-8:PC71BM film without MT decreases to 0.9 nm (Fig. 3e) and the surface roughness of the PDVF-8:PC71BM film with MT further decreases to 0.87 nm (Fig. 3f). The reduced surface roughness implies that the PDVF-8 and PC71BM were better mixed. Therefore both DIO and CN as a solvent additive led to an obvious reconstruction of the surface morphologies of the PDVF-8:PC71BM blends from the microscale to the nanoscale. The effects of the solvent additive and MT on the bulk morphologies of the PDVF-8:PC71BM blends were studied by TEM imaging as well. Fig. 4 demonstrates TEM images of the PDVF-8:PC71BM films spin-coated from CF, CF + DIO and CF + CN with (a, c and e) and without (b, d and f) MT. Large dark clusters (300–500 nm) are observed in the CF films shown in Fig. 4a and b which are consistent with the AFM images in Fig. 3a and b. The higher electron density of PC71BM compared with the polymer causes the electrons from the TEM beam to be scattered more efficiently by the PC71BM. Thus, the darker regions in the TEM images are regions of phase-separated PC71BM. Because the exciton diffusion length (<10 nm) is much smaller than the 300–500 nm clusters seen in Fig. 4a and b, photo-generated excitons will often decay before reaching the interfaces between the PDVF-8 and PC71BM in the films spin-coated from CF, resulting in the concomitant loss of photocurrent in Fig. 2a. However DIO, as an additive, results in the significantly smaller nanoscale phase separations in Fig. 4c and d. Replacing DIO with CN can further make the nanoscale phase separation finer, as seen in Fig. 4e and f. Moreover fibrillar PDVF-8 nanostructures are pronounced in Fig. 4c–f. Thus using DIO or CN leads to not only a smaller nanoscale phase separation but also better-connected percolated networks, causing the PDVF-8 network to form longer and better connected pathways. The morphology change corresponds to the large increase of hole mobility, as shown in Table 1.

Herein we try to provide a reasonable explanation for the morphology changes of the PDVF-8:PC71BM film from the microscale to the nanoscale by using small amounts of an additive (DIO or CN) as follows. Both DIO and CN are bad solvents for PDVF-8. In our experiments, we found that PDVF-8 solubility in CN was lower than 1.5 mg ml−1 and the PDVF-8 solubility in DIO was even lower than in CN. However, the PC71BM solubility in both DIO and CN was greater than 400 mg ml−1. It seems that both DIO and CN have similar working mechanism for the film morphology of PDVF-8:PC71BM from CF + DIO or CF + CN. During spin-coating, the PDVF-8:PC71BM from CF, with a low boiling point (61 °C), the intermolecular stacking of PDVF-8 and aggregation of PC71BM occur more easily and rapidly due to the quite fast evaporation of CF. Namely some portion of the PC71BM would be situated between the PDVF-8 chains to form some big size domains (300–500 nm) which hinder the formation of bicontinuous interpenetrating networks in the active layer. However, the high boiling point additive (332 °C for DIO and 260 °C for CN) gave rise to a change in the kinetics of the film growth. DIO or CN, with a high boiling point and a high PC71BM solubility, can prolong the solvent evaporation time to provide enough time for the complete film formation and for the dissolution of many PC71BM molecules, even in the bimolecular structure. This process prevents the formation of the bimolecular structure and facilitates a better nanoscale phase separation of PDVF-8 and PC71BM, leading to the bicontinuous change carrier pathway with an enlarged interfacial area.37
In order to further prove that the introduction of a little additive suppressed the aggregation of PC71BM and gave rise to better connected pathways of PDVF-8 and a bicontinuous interpenetrating network of PDVF-8 and PC71BM, we detected the distributions of sulphur (S) and carbon (C) elements of the PDVF-8:PC71BM films using TEM-energy dispersive spectrum (TEM-EDS) mapping in a smaller size. Because only PDVF-8 includes S atoms, S can be regarded as a sign of the polymer in the images. For comparison, the S and C distributions on the PDVF-8:PC71BM films from CF, CF + CN and CF + CN with MT were mapped by the SEM-EDS in Fig. 5, where yellow dots are sulfur elements (b, e, and h) and white dots are carbon elements (c, f, and i). At the same time, TEM images, at a closer magnification than Fig. 4, are also presented in Fig. 5a, d and g. For the film from CF, enriched C regions in the 4 corners of Fig. 5c correspond to the dark regions of PC71BM in Fig. 5a and enriched S regions in Fig. 5b correspond to light regions of PDVF-8 in Fig. 5a. Obviously both PDVF-8 and PC71BM have a poor discrete phase separation in the film from CF. However, the distributions of S (Fig. 5e) and C (Fig. 5f) become homogeneous for the film from CF + CN. Therefore both PDVF-8 and PC71BM have a continuous phase separation which facilitates the transport of charge carriers, in particular holes in the PDVF-8:PC71BM (1:3) blend film from CF + CN. At the same time, interfacial areas between the PDVF-8 and PC71BM are greatly improved because their phase separation changes from the microscale into the nanoscale, as shown in Fig. 5d. Furthermore, MT can lead to the denser and more uniform dots of S in Fig. 5h and C in Fig. 5i, resulting in the finer phase separation in Fig. 5g than the film without MT shown in Fig. 5d. As a result, MT, which further improved the nanoscale phase separation of PDVF-8 and PC71BM, gave rise to more enhancements in the mobilities of electrons and holes, as shown in Table 1.
 Fig. 5  Transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (TEM-EDS) images of PDVF-8:PC71BM films spin-coated from CF (a–c), and CF + CN without (d–f) and with (g–i) MT. The yellow dots (b, e, and h) signify sulfur elements; the white dots (c, f, and i) signify carbon elements; (a), (d) and (g) are TEM images. 
In addition, the EQE spectra in Fig. 2b presented some interesting information. For a given wavelength, the EQE values increase in the order of CF < CF + DIO < CF + CN, which is consistent with the Jsc values from the J–V curves under illumination. For all devices, higher EQE values are observed at 300–650 nm, which is in the absorption region of PC71BM.35 Because PDVF-8 hardly has any absorption in the short wavelength region, we assign the EQE spectra at 300–650 nm to the contribution of PC71BM and the EQE spectra at 650–900 nm to the contribution of PDVF-8. Compared to Device 1 without MT, the EQE spectrum of Device 2 with MT has a slight increase for all wavelengths at 300–900 nm. However for the devices with an additive (DIO or CN), MT only leads to a lift of the EQE spectra at 300–650 nm, as shown in Fig. 2b. The EQE spectra at 650–900 nm of the devices (Device 4 or 6) with MT are not different from the devices without MT (Device 3 or 5). Because alcohol treatments do not change the light absorption of the components in the active layer blend,38 we can infer that MT more efficiently improves the separation and transport of excitons formed in PC71BM than one of the excitons in PDVF-8. Therefore the EQE changes caused by MT originate from the reconstructed morphologies of the active layer blend, in particular the PC71BM.
Besides the lateral phase separated morphology, the vertical distribution of the components in the blend film is also critical. To verify the proposed morphology evolution during the MT, we focus on investigating the effect of MT on the vertical phase separation of PDVF-8 and PC71BM in the blend from CF + CN by employing XPS depth profiling. The S 2p peak represents the PDVF-8. The C 1s peak represents the total content of PDVF-8 and PC71BM. The S 2p/C 1s peak area ratio can be proportionally correlated to the percentage of PDVF-8 in the blend. Therefore, the PDVF-8 to PC71BM weight ratios in the vertical direction from top to bottom can be evaluated by using the S/C peak area ratios in XPS depth profiling (Fig. S5†). Fig. 6a presents the S/C ratio versus the etching time for the 70 nm PDVF-8:PC71BM film from CF + CN. Because 17 nm can be removed in 4 minutes of etching, 0, 4, 8 and 12 minute etchings approximately correspond to 70 nm (top surface), 53 nm, 36 nm and 19 nm (bottom) from bottom to top. For the pristine film without MT, the S/C ratio at the top surface is nearly three times that of the one at the bottom, suggesting a higher PDVF-8 concentration at the top surface and a higher PC71BM concentration at the bottom. When the film was treated by spin-coating methanol, the S/C ratio of the top surface reduced nearly half of that of the pristine film while the S/C ratio of the bottom increased by nearly half of that of the pristine film. This indicates that the PDVF-8 concentration at the top surface and the PC71BM concentration at the bottom are decreased while PDVF-8 concentration at the bottom and PC71BM at the top surface are increased by MT. In addition, MT makes the PDVF-8 better distributed in the vertical direction because the 4 red S/C ratios are close to each other after MT. Also, the concentration of PDVF-8 at the bottom is slightly higher than at the top surface after MT. Therefore a more uniform and homogeneous distribution was formed by MT in the vertical direction. In order to explain these findings, the detailed evolution of the phase separation in the blend film is schematically illustrated in Fig. 6b. Polymers and the small molecule PC71BM tend to aggregate on the top surface and bottom surface respectively during the spin-coating due to their different surface energies.39,40 After methanol was spin-coated on the PDVF-8:PC71BM film, it quickly penetrated into the film. Because CN is a good solvent for PC71BM and a bad solvent for PDVF-8, residual CN in the PDVF-8:PC71BM film can exist in the form of the solvent of PC71BM. During the evaporation of methanol, which is highly intersoluble with CN, PC71BM, accompanying CN, migrated and diffused from the bottom, contacting with PEDOT:PSS, to the top surface of the active layer, which is in agreement with the observations by Li et al. for the P3HT:PC61BM system41 and by Zhao et al. for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system.42 As a result, the vertical distributions of PDVF-8 and PC71BM become more uniform in the active layer of the PSCs, which not only provide a large interface area between the PDVF-8 and PC71BM for efficient exciton dissociation but also offers continuous pathways for quicker and more direct charge transportation to the corresponding electrodes.

4. Conclusion
The effects of solvent additives (DIO and CN) and MT on the device performance of PSCs based on a furan-flanked DPP copolymer, PDVF-8, have been investigated. When 3 vol% DIO or CN was used as a solvent additive to the PDVF-8:PC71BM solution in CF, the PCE can increase from 0.79% to 3.73% or 4.26%. MT can further enhance the PCE to 4.03% (DIO) and 4.69% (CN). AFM images demonstrated that both DIO and CN led to an obvious reconstruction of the surface morphologies of the PDVF-8:PC71BM blends from the microscale to the nanoscale. TEM and TEM-EDS images showed that using DIO or CN gave rise to not only a smaller nanoscale phase separation but also better connected percolated networks. XPS depth profiling proved that MT resulted in more uniform vertical distributions of PDVF-8 and PC71BM in the blend because MT induced migration and diffusion of PC71BM from the bottom, contacting with PEDOT:PSS, to the top surface of the active layer. The lateral and vertical nanoscale phase separations, with a bicontinuous interpenetrating network induced by solvent additives and MT, not only provided a large interface area between the PDVF-8 and PC71BM for efficient exciton dissociation but also offered continuous pathways for more direct and quick charge transportation to the corresponding electrodes so as to reduce charge recombination within the photoactive layer.
