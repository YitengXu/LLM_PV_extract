    , Accepted 3rd May 2022First published on 6th June 2022AbstractIn the context of global carbon capping and carbon neutrality, electrochemical methods for converting CO2 to CO are among the most promising and valuable methods for harvesting greenhouse gas pollutants and producing renewable energy. On this basis, nickel-doped layered boehmite (Ni–AlO(OH)3) was grown in situ on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as a carrier, forming composites with many active sites and good electrical conductivity. The crystal structure, morphology, specific surface area and composition of the samples were characterized. The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (ECR) performance of these catalysts was evaluated. The results show that the Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO catalyst has high product selectivity, with only carbon monoxide and hydrogen as the gas phase products and no liquid phase products, and the carbon monoxide faradaic efficiency (CO FE) can reach 92.20%, while the CO FE of AlO(OH)@RGO and Ni(OH)2@RGO can reach 44.9% and 88.2%, respectively. It was shown that composite catalysts formed by depositing Ni–AlO(OH)3 hydroxides on reduced graphene oxide had a higher CO2RR performance, which was related to the synergistic effect of bimetallic hydroxides and reduced graphene oxide.
1. Introduction
In recent years, large-scale thermal power generation has led to a rapid increase in global carbon dioxide emissions, and the increase in greenhouse gas emissions has accelerated the global warming trend.1,2 Therefore, it is urgent to convert and apply CO2 and other greenhouse gases to recycle waste into resources.3 Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (ECR) to produce CO has attracted a lot of attention from researchers.4,5 In response to the environmental and energy problems caused by CO2 emissions, several measures have been taken by various countries. For example, the development and utilization of carbon dioxide capture and transport technologies can mitigate the global warming problem to a certain extent, but this does not solve the problem at its root. Therefore, CO2 conversion and reduction technologies have attracted a lot of attention from the scientific and industrial communities. Compared with other CO2 conversion technologies, CO2 electrocatalytic reduction is driven by intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy, and can be performed at ambient temperature and pressure. Compared to photocatalytic CO2 reduction, electrocatalytic CO2 reduction has higher energy conversion efficiency and the selectivity of the product can be changed by changing the external conditions. In addition to temperature and pressure, the type of catalyst, structure and reaction potential can be changed. Therefore, electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 is a potential pathway for future CO conversion.6–8
In the ECR process, different catalysts promote the formation of different products. For 2-electron products, mostly CO and HCOOH, the metal catalysts for reduction to CO are mainly Ag, Au, Fe, Co and Ni. These catalysts use defect engineering, morphological changes, single atom doping, alloying, etc.9–13 to improve the activity of catalysts. A large number of scholars have shown that one of the main reasons for high reaction energy barriers is the excessive adsorption of CO on the catalyst surface. It has been suggested that the combination of transition metal elements with main group elements such as C and N can reduce the adsorption of CO on the catalyst surface.14–16 The M–N–C groups formed by the transition metal M (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) and the nitrogen (N) co-doped carbonyl C are considered catalytically active sites.13,17,18 Changing the electronic environment of the transition metal-center M by creating defects and introducing heteroatoms can improve its intrinsic catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction.19,20 However, it requires harsh preparation conditions and complex characterization methods to control the synthesis of the target active site, which suggests that such catalysts are difficult to prepare and apply on a large scale. Therefore, the search for a non-precious metal ECR catalyst with high activity, high selectivity, low cost and a simple preparation process is the key to achieving CO2 reduction and CO resource utilization.21,22Table 1 summarizes the properties of graphene-based non-precious metal composite catalysts studied in recent years.

For electrocatalytic applications, the supports are mainly carbon nanomaterials (CNMs), including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, etc.33 CNMs have high specific surface area and electrical conductivity, enabling high active site loading and fast electron transport, and a series of rapidly developing graphene production technologies have been developed, allowing graphene to be fabricated in large quantities and commercial applications. Graphene has a two-dimensional structure, is stable, and exhibits significant electron mobility, making it an ideal substrate for bimetallic hydroxides (LDHs). In addition, the low activity of CNMs towards HERs facilitates the suppression of competing reactions.34–37 The results show that Ru, Ni, Co and other metals have good catalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 to CO. However, the catalytic activity for carbon monoxide conversion exhibited by pure transition metal catalysts often does not meet the requirements of practical applications. Therefore, in order to obtain catalysts with excellent performance, catalysts must be designed in a targeted manner and suitable carriers and preparation methods must be selected.
Compared to precious metals, transition metal nickel is second only to ruthenium in catalytic activity and has a low cost. Due to its abundant surface acidity, certain thermal stability and flexible control properties, LDH has been widely used directly as a solid catalyst. Boehmite is a compound consisting of a positively charged main laminate and an interlayer anion assembled by non-covalent interactions. Its structure is similar to that of hydrotalcite Mg(OH)2, formed by the common edges of MgO6 octahedra. The unit layer structure has the following outstanding features. The chemical composition of the main layer can be adjusted; the type and number of interlayer guest anions can be adjusted; the particle size and distribution of the interlayer components can be adjusted. Based on the LDH precursor, the dispersion of nickel is improved, the chemical environment of the surface elements is adjusted, and the preparation of an efficient catalyst for the reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxideis achieved through the LDH–support interaction.
In this paper, a composite catalytic material with multiple active sites was grown and assembled in situ on a monolayer of reduced graphene oxide using a one-step hydrothermal synthesis method. This composite catalytic material has good electrical conductivity and selectivity, and low preparation cost. It provides a new strategy for the conversion and application of by-product CO2 at the Ningxia Energy chemical base, and also provides theoretical and technological support for the large-scale commercialization of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.
2. Experimental section
Aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O), formamide (CH3NO), urea (CH4N2O), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and graphene oxide (GO) were used. All reagents are analytically pure and require no further purification.
2.1 Materials preparation

2.1.1 Preparation of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO, Ni(OH)2@RGO, AlO(OH)@RGO and Ni–AlO(OH)3. 
Reduced graphene oxide–nickel-doped hydrated alumina composites (Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO) were synthesized by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. First, 24 mL of CH3NO was measured and mixed in a beaker containing 56 mL of deionized water and stirred well on a magnetic stirrer. Next, 2.4 g of CH4N2O was weighed and dissolved in the above mixed solution, and 80 mg of GO was weighed and dispersed in the above mixed solution and ultrasonicated for 30 minutes; 0.870 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.375 g of Al(NO3)3·9H2O were weighed and added into the mixed solution and stirred well. Third, the pH of the above mixed solution was adjusted to 10 by dropping in 1 M NaOH solution and stirring was continued for 30 min, and the above experimental procedure was carried out at room temperature. Then it was transferred to a stainless steel autoclave for 8 hours at 180 °C, cooled to room temperature, and the material was washed several times with deionized water and ethanol. Finally, the obtained solid was dried in an electric blast dryer at 60 °C to obtain Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO.
The preparation of Ni(OH)2@RGO was the same as the experimental procedure of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO described above, except that Al(NO3)3·9H2O was not added. No Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was added during the preparation of AlO(OH)@RGO. No GO was added during the preparation of Ni–AlO(OH)3.


2.1.2 Preparation of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO, Ni(OH)2@RGO, and AlO(OH)@RGO electrodes. 
5 mg of the prepared catalyst and 2 mg of carbon black were weighed and added to a test tube. A mixture solution including ethanol and Nafion was prepared at a volume ratio of 100:1. 0.5 ml of the mixed solution of ethanol and Nafion was taken in the test tube and sonicated for 30 min to form black ink. A pipette was used to take 40 μl of black ink and it was spread evenly on a 1 cm2 carbon electrode, and dried in an electric blast drying oven at 60 °C for 6 h before use.


2.1.3 Electrochemical performance test. 
In this experiment, a Shanghai Chenhua CHI660E electrochemical workstation was used to study the electrocatalytic performance of composite materials for the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide with a three-electrode system. The reference electrode was an Ag/AgCl electrode, the counter electrode was a platinum mesh electrode, and the catalyst was coated on carbon paper as the working electrode. The electrochemical properties of all catalysts were tested in an H-type double-chamber electrolytic cell. The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction was carried out in a cathodic reaction cell with 20 ml of 0.1 M aqueous potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3) solution for both the anode and cathodic reaction cells, and the pH of the electrolyte solution was adjusted to 6.8. A gas mass flow meter controlled the CO2 flow rate to 20 ml min−1, and the gas outlet of the cathodic reaction cell was connected to a gas chromatograph. The whole reaction was carried out at room temperature and pressure.

2.2 Characterization
A Rigaku RINT-2000 X-ray diffractometer (XRD) equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source was used to obtain X-ray diffraction patterns and was operated at 40 kV and 30 mA, with a step size of 0.01 and a scan rate of 8° min−1. Samples were scanned with a 2θ range from 5° to 80°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using Zeiss SIGMA 500 and JEOL JEM-2100 microscopes, respectively. The equipment used for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and the specific surface area test was an ESCALAB-250Xi and a 3H-2000PM1, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural and morphological analyses

3.1.1 Structural analysis. 

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of Ni–AlO(OH)3, AlO(OH)@RGO, Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO, Ni(OH)2@RGO and GO. Under the experimental conditions, the characteristic diffraction peaks of curves (a), (b) and (c) in Fig. 1 are all consistent with the JCPDS 88-2112 standard card. The 10 characteristic diffraction peaks appearing at 2θ are 14.461°, 28.109°, 38.257°, 48.813°, 55.092°, 60.457°, 63.883°, 64.777°, 67.532°, and 71.732° corresponding to the (020), (021), (130), (150), (151) (080), (132), (200), (171), and (152) crystal planes, reflecting the lamellar structure of Ni–AlO(OH)3. Observation of the overall pattern reveals a stable baseline with no obvious spurious peaks, and the results indicate that a small amount of nickel doping does not destroy the layered structure of hydrated aluminum hydroxide and form a new phase.38 Interestingly, the characteristic diffraction peaks of the nickel-related compound phases do not appear in the pattern, indicating that the number of nickel-related compounds formed is too small to be detected.39 The characteristic diffraction peaks of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) in Fig. 1(b) and (c) are not obvious. This is due to the adhesion of AlO(OH) and Ni–AlO(OH)3 produced by the reaction to the surface of RGO, resulting in the coverage of the characteristic peaks. Fig. 1(d) shows the XRD pattern of Ni(OH)2@RGO. The characteristic diffraction peaks of the nickel-related compounds are also not observed in the pattern. Only the 2θ peaks at 20–30° correspond to the characteristic diffraction peaks of reduced graphene oxide (002). Fig. 1(e) shows the XRD pattern of untreated graphene oxide (GO). There is a diffraction peak at 2θ of 10.596°. This characteristic diffraction peak corresponds to the characteristic peak of GO (001). After the hydrothermal reaction of all the above GOs, the characteristic diffraction peak of GO (001) at 10.596° disappears and the characteristic peak of graphene (002) appears, indicating that after hydrothermal synthesis, the oxygen-containing groups between the GO layers are reduced to form RGO.

3.1.2 SEM and TEM results. 
By SEM characterization, the surface morphology, shape and size of the catalyst materials can be obtained visually. Fig. 2(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) show the scanning images and energy spectrum (EDX) characterization of GO, Ni(OH)2@RGO, and Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO, respectively. Fig. 2(a) shows the GO without any treatment. From Fig. 2(a), it can be seen that the GO has a lamellar structure and wrinkles. From Fig. 2(b), it can be seen that the nickel compound in Ni(OH)2@RGO prepared by the hydrothermal synthesis method forms a small amount of very thin small fragments attached to the RGO, while most of the RGO is exposed, which corresponds to the characteristic XRD diffraction peaks in Fig. 1(d), wherein only the characteristic peaks of RGO can be detected. Fig. 2(d) shows the EDX map of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO. Fig. 2(d) shows the presence of Ni, Al, O and C in the composite. From the results of catalyst mapping (Fig. 2(e)), it can be acknowledged that the elements in the catalyst prepared by hydrothermal synthesis are homogeneously dispersed and no agglomerates of metal particles are formed. The EDX results show a Ni to Al content ratio of 1:16.2, and the results indicate that a small amount of Ni was successfully doped into AlO(OH).

Fig. 3(a), (b), (c) and (d) show the TEM characterization of Ni–AlO(OH)3, AlO(OH)@RGO, Ni(OH)2@RGO and Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 3(a) that there are a large number of irregular lamellar structures consisting of fibrous structural units at the edges, and the agglomerated structure inside is not favorable for the exposure of active sites. In Fig. 3(b), it can be observed that RGO and AlO(OH) are closely aligned and there is no obvious monomeric layer structure. Because there are very few phases forming Ni-associated hydroxides, only a tightly packed structure of RGO can be observed in Fig. 3(c). Fig. 3(d) shows Ni–AlO(OH)3 as a structural unit attached to the muslin-like monolayer RGO, forming a sheet-like structure, which is consistent with the SEM results in Fig. 1.

3.1.3 BET analysis. 
The specific surface areas of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO, AlO(OH)@RGO, Ni(OH)2@RGO, Ni–AlO(OH)3 and GO samples were calculated by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption method. Fig. 4 shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO, AlO(OH)@RGO, Ni(OH)2@RGO, Ni–AlO(OH)3, and GO. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that both GO and Ni–AlO(OH)3 exhibit type III isotherms, and the H3-type hysteresis loop appears in the moderate specific pressure region, indicating the presence of mesopores in the catalysts.40,41 The adsorption and desorption isotherms of the composite catalysts Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO, AlO(OH)@RGO and Ni(OH)2@RGO correspond to type IV, and the H4 type hysteresis loop appears in the medium-specific pressure region.42

Table 2 summarizes the BET specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameter of each catalyst. The results show that the minimum specific surface area of the GO catalyst with a smooth surface is 5.08 m2 g−1, and its pore volume and pore diameter are smaller than those of the composite catalyst. This is also evident in the SEM images. The specific surface area of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO is lower than that of AlO(OH)@RGO because Ni was added on top of AlO(OH)3@RGO during the preparation of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO species. Therefore, the hydroxide generated on the GO carrier during the synthesis of the sample clogs most of the pores, resulting in a small specific surface area of the sample.

3.1.4 XPS analysis. 

Fig. 5(a) shows the XPS spectra of Ni–AlO(OH)3, AlO(OH)@RGO, Ni(OH)2@RGO and Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO, which are easily observed in Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO. The peaks of C, O, Al, N and Ni are consistent with the EDX results. Fig. 5(b) and (d) analyze the changes in surface chemistry before and after the reduction of graphene oxide. From Fig. 5(b), it can be seen that a large number of oxygen-containing functional groups exist on the GO surface: 284.80 eV corresponds to CC, and C–C in the carbon skeleton of GO; 286.85 eV corresponds to C–O–C, reflecting the presence of epoxy groups on the GO surface; 288.54 eV corresponds to O–CO, reflecting the presence of carboxyl groups on the GO surface;43 in Fig. 5(d), it can be seen that the Ni–CO, O–CO, C–O–C, and C–OH bonds of RGO in AlO(OH)3@RGO are obviously reduced and the carbon to oxygen ratio is increased, indicating that the oxygen-containing functional groups on the GO surface disappear at high temperature during the thermal reduction process and the graphene oxide is effectively reduced, and reduced graphene oxide is successfully prepared. Fig. 5(d) shows the C 1s fine spectrum of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO, from which it can be seen that there are three conformations of C, namely graphene C–C/CC (284.8 eV), C–N/C–O bonds with N or O (285.44 eV), and surface adsorbed CO/CN (288.79 eV).

Fig. 5(c) shows the N 1s fine spectrum of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO. In this catalyst, there are three forms of nitrogen. The N 1s peaks in Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO are from pyridine nitrogen (398.61 eV), pyrrole nitrogen (400.06 eV) and graphite nitrogen (401.69 eV). The total doping content of nitrogen is 3.41%.44Fig. 5(e) shows the Ni 2p fine spectra of Ni(OH)2@RGO and Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO. The results in the figure show that the Ni 2p binding energy of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO is 0.05 eV higher than that of Ni(OH)2@RGO. Fig. 5(f) shows that the binding energy of Al 2p in AlO(OH)@RGO is 74.10 eV and that of Al 2p in Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO is 74.03 eV, indicating that the doping of a small amount of nickel shifts the binding energy of Al 2p toward a lower binding energy by 0.07 eV. Therefore, it can be inferred that the reason for this change may be related to the Ni2+ ion doping into AlO(OH). Related studies have shown that the Ni–AlO(OH)3 laminate is composed of infinite co-edged NiO6 and AlO6 octahedra.35,45,46 Therefore, when Ni2+ ions in solution enter AlO(OH), the Ni2+ ions replace the AlO6 octahedra. The Al3+ ions break the Al–O–Al bonds to form Al–O–Ni bonds, leading to an increase in the electron cloud density around Al and a shift toward lower binding energy. This result makes the electron equilibrium structure of Al3+ in Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO an electron-rich junction, which is beneficial for improving the electrocatalytic performance.47


3.1.5 Raman analysis. 

Fig. 6 shows the Raman spectra of GO and Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO composites. The spectrum of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO shows the graphene defect peak, the D peak of RGO, at 1311 cm−1, which represents the sp3 hybridized carbon atoms, and the characteristic G peak of crystalline carbon at 1578 cm−1, which corresponds to the sp2 hybridized carbon atoms on graphene. From the results, the ID/IG ratio of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO composites is higher than that of GO. This indicates that there are more defects in RGO in the composites, which is favorable for the formation of defective active sites.48,49

3.2 Electrocatalytic activity and stability experiment
The current density reflects the conductivity of the catalyst and the rate of the ECR reaction. Firstly, the electrochemical properties of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO, Ni(OH)2@RGO and AlO(OH)@RGO were evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) for CO2 reduction, and a preliminary relationship between the catalytic current of the samples and voltage can be obtained. Fig. 7(a) shows the total current density measured at different potentials, Fig. 7(b) shows the Faraday efficiency curve for carbon monoxide, and Fig. 7(c) shows the current density for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 (jCO). The total current density and Faraday efficiency measured at 30 min were used for the discussion. Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO maintains the maximum total current density over the entire test voltage range, and Ni(OH)2@RGO has a slightly smaller total current density than Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO. Both Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO and Ni(OH)2@RGO have significantly higher total current densities compared to AlO(OH)@RGO. During the whole test, the main products of CO2 electroreduction were CO and H2, and no liquid phase products were detected, indicating that all three catalysts have high selectivity for reduction to CO. According to the comparative analysis in Fig. 7(b), all three catalysts showed a trend of first increasing the carbon monoxide Faraday efficiency (CO FE) and then decreasing it with the increase of applied voltage. Among them, the material with the best selectivity for CO is Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO, with a CO FE of up to 92.2% at a potential of −0.9 V (vs. RHE), when the current density is −5.15 mA cm−2.
 Fig. 7  (a) The LSV curves of AlO(OH)@RGO, Ni(OH)2@RGO and Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO were recorded in a CO2 saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 solution at a scan rate of 1.0 mV s−1. (b) FE produces CO at various application potentials for AlO(OH)@RGO, Ni(OH)2@RGO and Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO. (c) jCO for AlO(OH)@RGO, Ni(OH)2@RGO and Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO at different potentials. (d) Tafel plots of CO production for the AlO(OH)@RGO, Ni(OH)2@RGO and Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO electrodes. (e) Current density differences (Δj) plotted against scan rates. (f) Stability of the Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO electrode for CO2 reduction at −0.9 V vs. RHE. 
Further comparing different composite catalysts, it is found that the specific surface area of the Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO catalyst with the highest electrocatalytic ECR in LSV is 133.29 m2 g−1, while the specific surface area of the lower electrocatalytic ECR active AlO(OH)@RGO catalyst reaching the maximum is 239.06 m2 g−1, indicating that the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide activity of the prepared catalyst is not directly related to the specific surface area.50–52
The value of the Tafel slope can indicate the difficulty of the electron transfer step in different catalyst systems. On the other hand, the Tafel curve is also a basis for intuitively judging the activity of the electrocatalyst. For ECR, generally, the smaller the Tafel slope, and the closer the catalyst to the lower right corner, the better its activity, and the lower the overpotential at the same current. Fig. 7(d) shows the corresponding Tafel curve. The Tafel slopes of AlO(OH)@RGO, Ni(OH)2@RGO and Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO are 160.4 mV dec−1, 160.0 mV dec−1, and 156.3 mV dec−1, respectively. In contrast, Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO has the smallest Tafel slope, indicating that Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO has a large current gain when the applied potential is low, which is beneficial for promoting the progress of the catalytic reaction,53,54 further confirming its superior catalytic activity. These Tafel slope values indicate that the initial adsorption process (* + CO2 + H+ + e− → *COOH) is the rate-determining step of the entire ECR process. Generally, a lower Tafel slope indicates higher kinetic activity, which would be due to the higher electron-donating capability of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO. All of these results reveal that Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO exhibits higher catalytic activity than Ni(OH)2@RGO and AlO(OH)@RGO, and such excellent activity outperforms most of the reported molecular catalysts.
To further explore the ECR catalytic mechanism of the catalyst materials and determine the reactive surface area, cyclic voltammetry curves were analyzed for AlO(OH)@RGO, Ni(OH)2@RGO and Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO and the results are shown in Fig. 7(e). The voltage window is set to −0.6 to −0.7 V vs. RHE, the scanning speed is set to 1–10 mV s−1, the current density is set to −0.65 V, and the electric double layer of the material is obtained by fitting the slope capacitance (Cdl), and then comparing the electrochemically active areas.10,55,56 The results show that the Cdl of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO has the maximum value, which means the largest electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). The larger ECSA combined with the porous structure can further explain the high ECR performance of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO.
Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO showed a certain degree of stability in a 3 hour test. In practical applications, higher demands are placed on its long-term stability. The stability of Ni–AiO(OH)3@RGO was tested for 3 h at the corresponding potential with the highest carbon monoxide Faraday efficiency. Fig. 7(f) shows the results of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO in the 3 h stability test, in which the CO Faraday efficiency decays from 92.2% to 65% for Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO in electrocatalysis, and the total current density also decreases with time. The decay of CO FE during the reaction is explained here. Since the catalyst is coated on the carbon paper electrode with a binder, on the one hand, there is no more reliable interface between the catalyst and the carbon paper; on the other hand, with the progress of the reaction, a large number of bubbles will be generated on the electrode surface, so that the catalyst coated on the carbon paper electrode is gradually carried away by the bubbles and displaced. The decrease of the effective catalyst led to the severe hydrogenation of electrolytic water, the increase of H2 FE and the decrease of CO FE.
4. Conclusion
A composite catalyst with RGO as the carrier and nickel–aluminum double metal hydroxide as the support was synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method, so that the two lamella structures are interspersed to form a certain pore channel, which is conducive to the exposure of active sites. This is conducive to the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products.
AlO(OH)@RGO and Ni(OH)2@RGO at the optimum applied voltage have CO FE values of 44.9% (−0.8 V vs. RHE) and 88.2% (−0.9 V vs. RHE) respectively, and the CO FE of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO is 92.2%. Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO has the highest CO FE and the best electrocatalytic activity, indicating that the combination of double metal hydroxide and nitrogen-doped RGO greatly improves the efficiency of electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO.
The excellent performance of Ni–AlO(OH)3@RGO comes from the abundant edge sites and defects, which promote the chemical adsorption of reactants and key intermediates. A high dispersion with a large number of pore networks is conducive to the transmission and diffusion of CO2 and electrolytes and can increase the reaction speed of ECR.
