, Accepted 11th September 2014First published on 11th September 2014AbstractSince the discovery of hydrogen evolution through the photoelectrochemical (PEC) splitting of water from n-type TiO2 electrodes, the technology of short-bandgap semiconductors (such as ZnSe, CdS and CdSe) combined with one-dimensional (1D) metal-oxide nanowire (NW) arrays (e.g., TiO2 and ZnO) to enhance their visible-light harvest efficiency has been widely studied. In this study, ZnSe/CdS/CdSe triple-sensitized ZnO NW arrays were successfully fabricated on FTO substrates via a facile hydrothermal and anion exchange reaction, followed by a chemical bath deposition (CBD) approach. Through the effective synergistic light absorption of the solar energy and the multi-type-II graded bandgap level between the core ZnO NW and the different photosensitization out layers in these composite nanostructures, a remarkable enhancement in photochemical conversion performance was achieved. The morphogenetic strategy used for the material production in this work is low-cost but effective, and it could be extended to prepare other core–multishell nanostructures with elaborate textural characteristics.
Introduction
Hydrogen has drawn considerable attention as an efficient alternative energy carrier to fossil fuels due to its clean and renewable characteristics. Since the first report on photocatalytic water splitting with TiO2 as photoanode by Fujishima and Honda in 1972,1 the generation of hydrogen utilizing simple and inexpensive procedures has received increasing attention. Recently, one-dimensional (1D) metal-oxide NW arrays (e.g., TiO2 and ZnO) have been widely explored as the PEC electrode materials because of their distinct virtues such as the long-lived photogenerated carriers, good electron mobility and facile synthesis.2–4 However, the large bandgaps of TiO2 and ZnO limited their light absorption to only the UV part of the solar spectrum, which strictly prevents the efficient utilization of the solar energy in the visible region. Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to enhance their visible light harvesting ability. For example, Li et al. reported that the hydrogen-treated rutile TiO2 (H:TiO2) nanowire arrays exhibit a much better light absorption ability and photocatalytic properties than that of the pristine TiO2 nanowires.5 Moreover, other suitable atom-doping methods were also explored to extend the working spectrum of TiO2-based and ZnO-based materials such as the red TiO2 nanoparticles reported by Nazeeruddin et al. and the N-doped ZnO nanowire arrays reported by Li and co-workers.6,7
Short-bandgap semiconductors such as ZnSe, CdS and CdSe were also combined with ZnO and TiO2 NW arrays to enhance their visible-light harvest efficiency, which is widely studied in quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSC) and water splitting.8–12 For example, as sensitizers, the light response region can be tailored by coating different kinds of semiconductor layers, allowing the energy conversion to match the spectral distribution of the incident sunlight. For light harvest devices, many studies have demonstrated that the tandem structure comprising of a combination of semiconductors with optimal band gap levels can maximize the absorption of solar light.13,14 However, the design of multijunction nanostructures for these PEC devices is still technically challenging. Recently, we reported the ZnO NW arrays that were sensitized with a composition-graded ZnxCd1−xSe alloy along the length of a substrate obtained by a temperature-graded CVD technology, which yielded a continuous light absorption from 460 to 700 nm across the surface of the core–shell NW arrays.15 Wang et al. also obtained the ZnO NW arrays on both sides of an ITO substrate, which were sensitized with CdS and CdSe nanoparticles. The results revealed that the double-sided sensitized ZnO NW arrays show a substantially improved PEC conversion efficiency in comparison to the single-sided co-sensitized NWs.16 However, to our knowledge, these photoelectrodes required more than one side (or part) to work separately, and therefore in reality it is not a single energy source.
In this study, we demonstrate a novel photoelectrode of ZnSe/CdS/CdSe triple-sensitized ZnO NW arrays that exhibit light absorption edge extended from 380 nm to 710 nm. Due to the multi-type-II graded bandgap level between the core ZnO NW and the different photosensitization out layers and a complementary light harvesting from UV part to visible region, the ZnSe/CdS/CdSe triple-sensitized ZnO NW arrays photoanode shows a substantially enhanced photocurrent density and IPCE in comparison to the single-sensitized (ZnSe or CdSe) and ZnSe/CdS co-sensitized ZnO NW arrays. To the best of our knowledge, the present work is the first attempt to incorporate a triple-sensitized ZnO photoelectrode for multi-bandgap photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation.
Experimental section
Synthesis of ZnO NW arrays
ZnO NW arrays were synthesized on FTO substrates via a hydrothermal method. The FTO substrates were cleaned separately by ultrasonication in acetone, ethanol, and deionized water, and dried in a steam of nitrogen. The as-cleaned substrates were dipped into the zinc acetate solution (5.0 mM) for 1 min and blown dry with air. This procedure was repeated ten times. After that, the FTO substrates were heated to 350 °C in air for 30 min. After cooling, the FTO substrates with the ZnO seeds were placed into a fresh aqueous solution of zinc nitrate (60 mM), hexamethylenetetramine (60 mM) and polyethylenimine (12 mM). The Teflon-lined autoclave was sealed and heated to 110 °C for 48 h without stirring. After growth in the arrays, the resultant samples were removed and rinsed thoroughly with water to get rid of any residual reactants and dried in air at 80 °C. Finally, the as-grown ZnO NW arrays were annealed at 450 °C for 1 h.
Preparation of ZnO@ZnSe core–shell NW arrays
Arrays of ZnO@ZnSe core–shell NW were prepared by immersing the ZnO NW arrays in a Se2− ion solution (6.0 mM) prepared by reacting Se powder with sodium borohydride in a round-bottomed flask and kept at 50 °C for 10 min.
Fabrication of ZnO@ZnSe/CdS core–shell NW arrays
For deposition of CdS on ZnO@ZnSe NW arrays by CBD approach, aqueous solution of cadmium acetate (100 mM) and aqueous solution of sodium sulphide (100 mM) were used as Cd2+ and S2− precursor, respectively. Briefly, the ZnO@ZnSe nanocable arrays were immersed in a solution of cadmium acetate for 1 minute to allow the absorption of Cd2+ onto the ZnO@ZnSe nanocable arrays. The substrates were then dried with a N2 stream. To form the CdS layers, the dried substrates were dipped into a sodium sulphide solution for another 1 minute, where the preabsorbed Cd2+ could react with S2−. The substrates were then rinsed with the deionized water and dried again with a N2 stream. This procedure was repeated 10 times to obtain the desired thickness of CdS.
Synthesis of ZnSe/CdS/CdSe triple-sensitized ZnO NW arrays
The deposition of the CdSe layer was similar to that of the CdS layer, except for the aqueous solution of sodium sulphide, which was replaced by sodium selenide in ethanol solution. Here, the sodium selenide solution was prepared by dissolving selenium dioxide (30 mM) and sodium borohydride (60 mM) in ethanol in a round-bottomed flask under the protection of N2. For the preparation of the ZnO@CdSe controlled sample, the CdSe sensitizer layer was directly assembled on the ZnO NW arrays.
Sample characterizations
The morphology and microstructures of the samples were characterized using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL, JSM-6700F) equipped with a EDS spectrometer and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2010F). Raman spectra of the as-obtained samples were recorded on a Renishaw InVia system with a laser operating at λ = 532 nm as the excitation source. UV-visible absorbance spectra were obtained on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2550). The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a Zolix Solar Cell QE/IPCE measurement system with a standard silicon solar cell as the reference in three electrodes configuration at zero bias versus Ag/AgCl.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The PEC measurements of these NW arrays photoelectrodes were carried out in electrolytes containing 0.35 M Na2SO3 and 0.24 M Na2S (pH 11.5) with CHI660D electrochemical workstation. The as-prepared NW arrays on FTO electrode was used as the working electrode, a Pt foil as the counter electrode, and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The photocurrent densities versus measured potential (i–v curve) measurements were performed in a standard three-electrode configuration under AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight from a 150 W Xe lamp (Sciencetech SS150). The incident light intensity was measured with a digital power meter and was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2.
Results and discussion
The typical synthesis process of ZnSe/CdS/CdSe triple-sensitized ZnO NW arrays on FTO substrates is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. Briefly, the oriented ZnO NW arrays were grown on conductive FTO substrate by a seed layer assisted hydrothermal method (step 1).17 After that, the ZnO@ZnSe core–shell structures were prepared by converting the surface ZnO into ZnSe via an anion exchange reaction (step 2).18 Finally, the ZnSe/CdS/CdSe triple-sensitized ZnO photoelectrodes were obtained by successive chemical bath deposition (CBD) of CdS and CdSe on the pre-prepared ZnO@ZnSe nanocables (step 3 and 4), respectively.19 Fig. 2a and c show the typical SEM images of the bare ZnO NW array with a rod density of about 2.1 × 109 rods per cm2 and diameters of 80–200 nm. Compared with the bare ZnO NW arrays, the ZnSe/CdS/CdSe triple-sensitized ZnO NW arrays have a rough surface (Fig. 2b and d), which is caused by the cluster growth during the sequent sensitive processes. Fig. 2e is a typical TEM image of the ZnSe/CdS/CdSe triple-sensitized ZnO NW. A closer view of the surface reveals that the thickness of CdSe, CdS and ZnSe on ZnO NW are approximately 5.8 nm, 7.6 nm and 5.2 nm, respectively (Fig. 2f).

Step-dependent EDS analysis was used to confirm the successful synthesis of the ZnSe/CdS/CdSe triple-sensitized ZnO NW arrays. As can be seen from Fig. 3a, the substances corresponding to the black curve only contain the elements Zn and O, which reveals that the sample obtained in step 1 is pure ZnO. In addition to the peaks of ZnO, the red curve also shows another moderate peak, corresponding to Se, thus suggesting the production of a ZnSe shell on the core ZnO NW after the anion exchange process. When the first CBD process was completed, the blue curve shows the emergence of Cd and S elements, as well as the peaks from ZnO@ZnSe, confirming that the composition after step 3 is ZnO@ZnSe/CdS. After the second CBD process, it was found that the signal intensities of Se and Cd increased, which corresponds to the structure of ZnO@ZnSe/CdS/CdSe (see green curve in Fig. 3a).

This structure evolution is also confirmed by the Raman spectroscopy measurements. As shown in Fig. 3b, the characteristic Raman patterns of the ZnSe/CdS/CdSe triple-sensitized ZnO NW arrays exhibit three prominent peaks at 200.8 cm−1, 250 cm−1 and 303.1 cm−1, which can be assigned to their first-order of longitudinal optical phonon modes (1LO) of CdSe,20 ZnSe (ref. 21) and CdS,22 respectively. The Raman peak intensity of ZnSe decreases gradually from the ZnO@ZnSe to ZnO@ZnSe/CdS, and then to the ZnSe/CdS/CdSe triple-sensitized ZnO NW arrays. Raman signals of ZnO were not detected for any of the sensitized samples, suggesting that the entire ZnO NWs were covered by the out layers with different kinds of sensitizers in each step.
Inset of Fig. 4 shows images of arrays of the bare ZnO, ZnO@ZnSe, ZnO@ZnSe/CdS, ZnO@ZnSe/CdS/CdSe and ZnO@CdSe on FTO substrates. The sample color changed from white for ZnO to primrose yellow for ZnO@ZnSe, to orange for ZnO@ZnSe/CdS, and then to dark brown for ZnO@ZnSe/CdS/CdSe. The color of the ZnO@CdSe NW arrays is also in dark brown, but it is brighter in color compared with the ZnO@ZnSe/CdS/CdSe NWs. The corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. 4. The as-grown ZnO NW arrays absorb only in the UV region at a wavelength shorter than 400 nm. However, after the deposition of the ZnSe layer, the absorption edge is extended up to ∼700 nm. Samples of ZnO@ZnSe/CdS and ZnO@ZnSe/CdS/CdSe NW arrays have similar absorption edges to that of the ZnO@ZnSe NWs, but the absorbance of ZnO@ZnSe/CdS/CdSe is clearly higher than that of the ZnO@ZnSe/CdS NWs. Apparently, the triple-sensitized electrode presents a synergistic effect, enhancing its light absorption ability.23–25

To estimate the electrochemical properties of photoanodes that were fabricated from ZnO NW arrays coated with various sensitizers, photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in an electrolyte solution containing 0.35 M Na2SO3 and 0.24 M Na2S (pH 11.5) under AM 1.5 G at 100 mW cm−2 illumination. Fig. 5a shows the current density versus potential (i–v) curves of the photoelectrodes, including the bare and the single- or co- and triple-sensitized ZnO NW arrays. All samples show negligible background current under the dark conditions. The linear i–v curves differ somewhat for the different photoanodes. For the single-sensitized ZnO@ZnSe and ZnO@CdSe photoelectrodes, the photocurrent density starts at approximately −0.63 V and approaches ∼0.82 mA cm−2 and ∼1.73 mA cm−2 at 0 V versus Ag/AgCl. However, for ZnSe/CdS/CdSe triple-sensitized ZnO NW arrays photoelectrode, the photocurrent onset potential (Von) is ∼−1.5 V versus Ag/AgCl, which is considerably higher than that value of the bare ZnO (∼−0.48 V), and the abovementioned two single-sensitized photoelectrodes. Furthermore, the ZnSe/CdS co-sensitized ZnO NW arrays sample shows a similar Von to that value of the triple-sensitized photoelectrode. The increase in Von is mainly ascribed to a more negative Fermi level, which is obtained in the co- and triple-sensitized composite system as compared to the single-sensitized samples.26,27 This result also suggests that the presence of the CdS shell may be crucial for the improvement of Von in the composite photoelectrodes. Furthermore, the triple-sensitized ZnO NW arrays photoelectrode also shows a significant enhanced photocurrent intensity of ∼5.3 mA cm−2 at 0 V versus Ag/AgCl, exceeding that of the single- or co-sensitized photoelectrodes and was more than 11 times higher than that of the bare ZnO NWs (∼0.43 mA cm−2).

It is well known that when a semiconductor is irradiated by light with energy higher than its bandgap, photoinduced electron–hole pairs are created. The photocurrent density is not only determined by the excited amount of electron–hole pairs but also by the transport of both electrons and holes across the electrode.28 Thus, it is believed that the optimized performance of the PEC photoanode could be attributed to the following reasons: (i) the complementary absorption of incident light from UV to the visible region, (ii) the multi-type-II bandgap arrangement at the interface among ZnSe/CdS/CdSe and the ZnO NW arrays, and (iii) the multi-electric fields in the their space-charge regions. In Fig. 6, the light absorption and the electron–hole pairs transfer process are proposed. In this case, due to the high absorption coefficient in the visible region of ZnSe, CdS and CdSe, light is absorbed by either phase, which indicates that relatively more photons could be trapped for producing the electron–hole pairs. Hence, the utilization of the solar light energy by the triple-sensitized ZnO NW arrays is significantly enhanced. Moreover, the proper matching of the energy levels of ZnO@ZnSe/CdS/CdSe leads to an appropriate step-wised type-II bandgap alignment in these core–multishell photoelectrode, which enables the quick separation of the photoinduced carriers and the fast movement of electrons from the step-wise conduction band of the shells to the core. Because the topological interfacial boundary in this core–multishell photoelectrode is always nearby, the multi-electric fields formed in the their space-charge regions are also advantageous to the electron injection and hole recovery of the system. Furthermore, the vertical standing of the ZnO NW arrays on the FTO substrate provides the photoinjected electrons with a direct pathway to the photoanode, which is also responsible for the excellent carrier transport performance of the as-obtained samples.

The transient photocurrent responses of various samples are investigated for several on–off cycles at zero bias versus Ag/AgCl in chopped light irradiation. From the results in Fig. 5b, the photocurrent values of all photoelectrodes decrease rapidly to nearly zero as soon as the light turns off, and then increases again when the light turns on. This phenomenon indicates that most of the photogenerated electrons migrate into the FTO current collector to yield the photocurrent under light illumination. Comparatively, the transient photoresponse of the ZnSe/CdS/CdSe triple-sensitized ZnO NW arrays photoelectrode is the highest, and is nearly twice the value of ZnSe/CdS co-sensitized ZnO counterpart. This result suggests a lower rate of recombination and more efficient separation of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs for the ZnO@ZnSe/CdS/CdSe photoelectrode.29–31
To get further insight into the charge transfer and recombination processes in the photoanodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out under open circuit conditions. The radius of the arc on the EIS spectra is associated with the charge-transfer ability of the photoelectrode. A larger arc radius usually represents a larger charge transfer resistance, and therefore a lower separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs.32 Fig. 7 shows the Nyquist plots of various samples of ZnO NW arrays based photoanodes under 1 sun light irradiation at room temperature. It is observed that the arc radius of the impedance decreases when the number of coating layers on the photoelectrode increases and that of the ZnO@ZnSe/CdS/CdSe is the smallest one. This result suggests that successive triple sensitization of ZnSe, CdS and CdSe on the ZnO NW arrays leads to a more effective charge separation and a faster interfacial charge transfer in the electrolyte. It is also noticed that the arc radius of the ZnO@ZnSe/CdS is much smaller than that of the pure ZnO and the co-sensitized photoelectrodes, which indicates that the introduction of the middle layer of ZnSe/CdS could change the charge distribution, and thus effectively improve the separation and transfer efficiency of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs through the interfacial interaction among ZnSe/CdS, CdSe and ZnO NWs.

To quantify the photoactivity of the samples to the incident light at various wavelengths, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) tests were performed at zero bias versus Ag/AgCl. The IPCE of the samples was calculated as follows:16,33,34IPCE = (1240 × I)/(λ × Jlight)where I is the photocurrent density, λ is the wavelength of the monochromatic light, and Jlight is the measured irradiance of monochromatic light. The IPCE curves of the ZnO, ZnO@CdSe, ZnO@ZnSe/CdS, and ZnO@ZnSe/CdS/CdSe photoanodes are shown in Fig. 8. The observed IPCE results are consistent with the corresponding absorption spectra. The photoresponse of the bare ZnO is only active in the UV region of the spectrum. After the deposition of CdSe, the photoresponse extends to a wavelength of ∼640 nm. The photoresponse of the ZnO@ZnSe/CdS photoanode is minimal until ∼550 nm, and then it sharply increases once the monochromatic light energy is bigger than the bandgap of CdS (2.4 eV). The ZnO@ZnSe/CdS/CdSe shows the widest IPCE spectrum, having a much higher efficiency in the visible region than the others. This result further confirms that the light harvesting and charge separation and transportation is more efficient in the ZnSe/CdS/CdSe triple-sensitized ZnO NW arrays photoelectrode, which is crucial for its highest photocurrent generation.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed a ZnSe/CdS/CdSe triple-sensitized ZnO NW arrays photoanode with a stepwise arrangement of type-II bandgap level from the outermost layer of CdSe to the core of ZnO NWs, which allows a complementary light absorption of the solar spectrum from UV to the visible region. This type of core–multi-shell heterostructure also facilitates the photogenerated electron–hole pair separation and the electron transfer from CdSe to CdS, ZnSe, and finally to the ZnO nanorods. By using such core–multi-shell nanowire arrays as photoanodes for PEC solar hydrogen generation, a remarkable enhancement in PEC performance is achieved.
