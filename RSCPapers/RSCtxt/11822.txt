    , Accepted 22nd June 2022First published on 22nd June 2022AbstractPorous graphitic carbon nitride with nitrogen vacancies (N–CN) has been successfully synthesized using a facile CaCO3 template method. The porous structure contributed to the increased surface area of the obtained N–CN photocatalyst. The formed N3C vacancies perturbed the localized electron distribution and tailored the electronic band structure, leading to an extended visible light response and the enhanced dissociation and transportation of photoexcited charge carriers. As a result, the as-prepared N–CN photocatalyst exhibited a 3.2-fold enhancement in the H2 evolution rate in comparison with a bulk CN photocatalyst, which was attributed to the modified architecture and the presence of N3C vacancies.
Introduction
With the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization, the high consumption of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas leads to severe air pollution and resource shortages.1–3 Hydrogen energy (H2), a low-carbon and zero-carbon energy source, has been recognized as one of the most promising energy carriers to solve energy and environmental issues for the sustainable development of society.4,5 Various technologies have been adopted to produce H2, among which water splitting driven by solar energy has attracted extensive attention, because this process is clean, environmentally friendly and low-cost.6–8 Developing high-efficiency photocatalysts is essential to achieving satisfactory H2 production activity via water splitting. Non-metallic graphitic carbon nitride (CN) is an appealing photocatalyst for H2 generation due to its earth-abundant character, visible-light response, facile synthesis and suitable redox ability.9–11 However, the undesirable H2 evolution activity of bulk CN owing to the low surface area, insufficient visible light utilization and poor photoelectric conversion efficiency blocks its large-scale industrial application.12,13
Porous morphology design is an easy strategy to increase the surface area of photocatalysts, thereby facilitating the adsorption and diffusion of reactants, exposing more active sites and thus improving their photocatalytic H2 production performance.14 Various methods have been attempted to prepare porous CN, such as the soft-templating method, hard-templating method, supramolecular assembly and interfacial assembly, among others.15–18 Due to the general presence of carbon residues in the final products obtained using the soft templating route and the complexity of supramolecular assembly and interfacial assembly, the hard templating method is preferred for the facile preparation of porous CN.19 However, the common hard templates, such as silica and anodic aluminum oxide (AAO), must be removed by hazardous etchants (HF/NH4HF2/NaOH).20–22 Accordingly, it is pressing to choose low-cost and environment-friendly templates to prepare porous CN.
Another intensive approach for further improving photocatalytic H2 evolution performance is defect engineering, which can induce localized electron redistribution to optimize the behaviour of the carriers.23 Recently, it has been found that precursor reforming or post-treatment strategies can introduce vacancies within CN photocatalysts. Wang et al. prepared CN with N vacancies using a N-deficient precursor obtained via hydrothermal treatment.24 Nguyen et al. synthesized CN with a high concentration of N vacancies through a polyethyleneimine (PEI)/alkaline co-assisted route.25 Iqbal et al. introduced N vacancies into a CN substrate by using glucose and melamine as precursors.26 Direct post-treatment techniques have been adopted to incorporate N vacancies within the CN matrix, such as photocarving or calcination in an NH3/N2 atmosphere.27,28 Nevertheless, these methods increase the time consumption and cost. Thus, it would be desirable to develop a facile and feasible method to prepare a CN photocatalyst with both a porous structure and vacancies combining the advantages of the two strategies to further improve the H2 generation performance.
In this work, we report a facile method for the preparation of a porous CN photocatalyst with N3C vacancies (N–CN) using calcium carbonate microspheres (CaCO3) as a hard template. Compared with silica templates, the CaCO3 template could be easily removed with dilute hydrochloric acid, making the synthesis process more environmentally friendly. The porous N–CN obtained after the template was removed possessed a greater surface area than that of pristine CN. The formed N3C vacancies tailored the electronic energy band structure and perturbed the localized electron distribution, resulting in extended visible light adsorption and enhanced dissociation and migration of the photogenerated charge carriers. Thus, the H2 evolution rate of the N–CN photocatalyst was 3.2 times higher than that of bulk CN.
Experimental
Materials
Dicyandiamide (C2H4N4, DCDA), chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6 6H2O) and Nafion were purchased from Aladdin Company. Commercial calcium carbonate (CaCO3) microspheres with an average size of 40 nm were purchased from Nanjing Xianfeng Nanomaterials Technology Co., Ltd. Triethanolamine (TEOA), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and ethanol were purchased from Beijing Chemical Works. All the chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without purification. Fluoride tin oxide (FTO) glass was purchased from Xiangcheng Technology Co., Ltd. Deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm) was used throughout all the experiments.
Synthetic procedures
The bulk CN photocatalyst was prepared via the thermal polymerization of DCDA. The N–CN photocatalyst was synthesized using a CaCO3 templating method. In a typical procedure, 1 g of DCDA and 250 mg of CaCO3 microspheres were added to 2 mL of deionized water. The solution was stirred for 2 h and dried in a vacuum oven. The remaining white precipitate was calcined in a muffle furnace at 520 °C for 2 h. The obtained dark-green product was dispersed in hydrochloric acid solution (HCl, 1 mol L−1) for 3 h to remove the CaCO3 templates. The precipitate was then washed with deionized water until the supernatant became neutral. The resulting light green powder was dried in a vacuum oven and denoted as the N–CN sample.
Material characterization
The morphology of the photocatalysts was observed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Hitachi S4800 and via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a FEI Tecnai F20. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were acquired using a Bruker Dimension Icon atomic force microscope in tapping mode. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using a Thermo Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at a scanning rate of 5 °C min−1. 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained using a Bruker 400M spectrometer. X-Ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using a PHI Quantera II spectrometer with non-monochromatized Al-Kα X-rays as an excitation source. The contents of the elements C and N in the CN substrate were evaluated using an Elementar Vario EL cube elemental analyzer. UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were monitored using a PerkinElmer LS-55 Luminescence Spectrometer under an excitation wavelength of 365 nm. PL decay curves were collected using a HORIBA Scientific DeltaflexFlex fluorescence lifetime system. Surface areas and pore size distributions were acquired by nitrogen physisorption at 77 K using a Nova 1200e Surface Area and Porosity Analyzer. The electron spin resonance spectra were obtained using a Bruker A300-10/12 paramagnetic resonance spectrometer.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed using a Chenhua CHI660 electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell with platinum gauze and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the counter and reference electrode. The working electrodes were prepared using fluoride tin oxide (FTO) glass coated with a photocatalyst layer. The electrolyte was 0.5 mol L−1 aqueous Na2SO4 solution saturated with N2. A 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Perfect Light) was used as a light irradiation source. Mott–Schottky plots were measured in the potential range of 0–0.6 V at a voltage magnitude of 10 mV and frequency of 1 kHz. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were tested in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz under a voltage magnitude of 10 mV.
Computational methods and models
All of the DFT calculations were performed using the Gaussian 16 package. All geometries were optimized by employing B3LYP with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set. Grimme's DFT-D3 method was applied to correct the van der Waals interactions for all molecules. Analysis of the electronic structures, including the HOMO, LUMO and density of states (DOS), was performed using Multiwfn. For the DOS calculations, the full width at half maximum was set as 0.2 eV. In this work, a minimum unit cell (CN or N–CN trimer) with one nitrogen pot was selected as the calculation model. The structural optimizations were performed without any symmetry constraints.
Photocatalytic performance measurements
The photocatalytic H2 evolution tests were performed in a sealed reactor. 50 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed into 100 mL of an aqueous solution containing 10 vol% TEOA and 3 wt% Pt. A 300 W Xe lamp was used as a light irradiation source. Before irradiation, the aqueous solution was stirred for 1 h and bubbled with N2 to completely remove dissolved O2. At specific time intervals, the gaseous products were quantified using a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 7890A).
Results and discussion
In this work, commercial CaCO3 microspheres were adopted as a hard template to synthesize a porous CN photocatalyst with N vacancies (N–CN). The preparation procedure for the N–CN photocatalyst is illustrated schematically in Scheme 1. In the first step, the CN–CaCO3 composite was obtained via the calcination of a mixture of DCDA and CaCO3 microspheres. Subsequently, the CaCO3 template was removed using dilute hydrochloric acid to obtain the final porous N–CN photocatalyst. The morphologies of the as-prepared CN and N–CN photocatalysts were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The SEM image of bulk CN photocatalyst showed a stacked layered structure with a smooth surface (Fig. 1a). In contrast, the N–CN photocatalyst exhibited numerous nanopores (Fig. 1b), demonstrating successful formation of a porous architecture within the layered structure. TEM observations also confirmed the typical layered structure of CN (Fig. 1c). After removal of the CaCO3 template, its thickness was evidently reduced and a considerable amount of nanopores was generated (Fig. 1d).

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out to obtain the real micromorphology of the N–CN photocatalyst with quantitative thickness and height features (Fig. 2a–c). The measured thickness of the N–CN sample with a height of approximately 2.0 nm indicated 6–7 monolayers,29 which was significantly lower than that of bulk CN (Fig. 1a). The morphology along with AFM characterizations suggested the CaCO3 template method contributed to reduced thickness and porous structure generation of N–CN photocatalyst, which could be further confirmed by BET tests. The type-IV isotherm of as-prepared sample revealed the mesoporous structure of the bulk CN and N–CN photocatalysts (Fig. 2d). As displayed in the inset, the mesopores in the 5–10 nm range for both the bulk CN and N–CN photocatalysts were produced via etching by the NH3 bubbles during the preparation procedure.30 The high proportion of mesopores in the 10–45 nm range in the N–CN photocatalyst originated from the CaCO3 template removal. The increased mesopores and reduced layers induced a nearly five-fold increase in the surface area of the N–CN sample compared to that of the bulk CN (Table S1, ESI†), favoring the adsorption of reactants and reducing the transport distance of photoexcited charge carriers, both of which were beneficial for improving the photocatalytic H2 generation performance.

XRD was performed to characterize the crystal structure of the synthesized samples. The negligible differences in the XRD peak positions for the bulk CN and N–CN samples illustrated that the crystal structure of CN remained unchanged after the CaCO3 template removal (Fig. 3a). Obviously, the intensity of the (002) diffraction peak corresponding to the stacked conjugated aromatic system decreased for the N–CN photocatalyst, further confirming its reduced number of layers, which was ascribed to the inhibited condensation in the presence of the CaCO3 template.31 It was observed that the bulk CN and N–CN samples showed identical FTIR spectra (Fig. S1, ESI†), revealing that the molecular skeleton was maintained in the N–CN sample. The 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectra were measured to analyze the carbon species, as seen in Fig. 3b. The bulk CN exhibited two distinct peaks centered at 157.34 and 163.66 ppm, which could be ascribed to the chemical shifts of N–CN and C–NHx in the heptazine units, respectively.32 These characteristic peaks were also observed in the N–CN sample, confirming the preserved heptazine-based structure. Moreover, the downshift in the peak (156.74 ppm) of the N–CN sample implied a more electron-rich chemical state of the carbon species, corresponding to N–CN, demonstrating that change that affected the chemical environment of the sp2-hybrid carbon atoms took place.

X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted to elucidate the elemental states of the bulk CN and N–CN photocatalysts. The survey XPS spectra of the bare CN and N–CN photocatalysts both confirmed the co-existence of the elements C, N and O (Fig. S2, ESI†). The absence of other elements indicated that the CaCO3 template had been completely removed. The high-resolution XPS spectra of the bulk CN and N–CN photocatalysts exhibited identical peak positions (Fig. 3c–e), further illustrating the CaCO3 template method did not change the C/N/O species of the CN photocatalyst.
The elemental analysis (EA) and surface atomic ratios were investigated to analyze the variation in the composition of the photocatalysts, as shown in Tables 1 and 2. The EA results exhibited an increased C/N mol ratio for the N–CN sample (0.687) compared to that of the bulk CN sample (0.663), suggesting that the CaCO3 template method could selectively etch nitrogen atoms to create N vacancies within the matrix. The surface atomic ratios of the CN and N–CN photocatalysts according to the XPS measurements are summarized in Table 2. The significantly increased surface C/N atomic ratio of the N–CN sample (1.969) compared to that of the bulk CN sample (1.328) implied that the formed N vacancies mainly existed on the surface of the N–CN photocatalyst. The XPS results, along with the 13C NMR results, confirm that sp2 carbons, C–N bonds, N–C–O, and C–O from HDMP all existed within the carbon nitride matrix.

The N vacancies within the N–CN photocatalyst were further verified using the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra (Fig. 3f). In comparison with the low ESR signal of bulk CN, N–CN showed an evident ESR response enhancement at a g value of 2.004, which stemmed from the unpaired electrons of the carbon atoms in the heptazine rings (N vacancy).33 The EA, surface atomic ratio, and ESR results confirmed the N vacancy formation within the N–CN photocatalyst realized via the CaCO3 template method. To identify the location of the N vacancies within the N–CN photocatalyst, the peak area ratio variation in the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectra was analyzed and quantified. The N 1s peaks centered at 398.8 and 400.3 eV were assigned to C–NC and N–(C)3 groups (namely, N2C and N3C). The weak N 1s peak at 401.2 eV was ascribed to the terminal –NHx groups.34 The increased peak area ratios of N2C to N3C for the N–CN photocatalyst (5.23) compared to the bulk CN photocatalyst (4.79) indicated that the loss of nitrogen atoms was from the N3C sites (Table 3). The increased terminal N–Hx group contents implied the partial cleavage of N–(C)3 bonds into N–Hx fragments. The presence of N3C vacancies led to the increased electron density of the sp2-hybrid carbon atoms in the heptazine units, in good agreement with the 13C NMR results.

In order to evaluate the expected improvement in the performance of the designed N–CN sample, measurements of H2 production via water splitting were carried out. Fig. 4a presents a comparison of the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of the bulk CN and N–CN photocatalysts. The H2 generation rate for the N–CN photocatalyst (800 μmol g−1 h−1) was 3.2 times higher than that of the bulk CN photocatalyst (251 μmol g−1 h−1), revealing that the simultaneous existence of nanopores and N3C vacancies effectively boosted the photocatalytic performance. More importantly, the activity of the N–CN photocatalyst was maintained well after four photocatalytic H2 generation cycles (Fig. 4b), confirming the excellent photo-stability of the as-prepared N–CN photocatalyst. As we know, the increased surface area of the N–CN photocatalyst was one of the reasons for its enhanced H2 evolution performance. In addition, the visible light harvesting ability and photoelectric conversion efficiency of the N–CN photocatalyst directly determined the H2 generation performance by influencing the generation, dissociation and transportation efficiency of the photoexcited charge carriers. Therefore, the optical and photoelectric properties of the N–CN photocatalyst were characterized to further clarify its H2 production enhancement mechanism.

(c) UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of CN and N–CN. (d) Variations in the wavelength-dependent photocatalytic H2 production rate of N–CN, with its light absorption spectrum provided as a reference. 
The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded to verify the visible light adsorption capacity of the as-prepared photocatalysts (Fig. 4c). The bulk CN photocatalyst exhibited an absorption edge around 460 nm arising from the semiconductor band–band transition. An obvious red shift of the adsorption edge and enhanced harvesting capacity in the visible light range of 500–800 nm for the N–CN photocatalyst could be observed. The contribution of the extended visible light utilization to the photocatalytic performance of the N–CN photocatalyst was investigated via H2 production tests under monochromatic irradiation. The H2 generation rates of the N–CN photocatalyst were 25.6, 18.8 and 11.4 μmol g−1 h−1, corresponding to monochromatic irradiation wavelengths of 490, 570 and 660 nm, respectively. In comparison, the bulk CN photocatalyst showed no photocatalytic activity under irradiation wavelengths beyond 470 nm. The variation in the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of the N–CN photocatalyst under monochromatic irradiation showed a similar trend to its light absorption spectrum (Fig. 4d), revealing that extended visible light absorbance was one factor responsible for the elevated photocatalytic performance of the N–CN photocatalyst.
The photoelectric conversion efficiency of the as-prepared photocatalysts was characterized using transient photoluminescence (PL) decay spectra, steady-state PL emission spectra, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and the periodic photocurrent response. To achieve a high-efficiency photocatalyst, the undesirable radiative recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers must be suppressed. The average lifetime (Aτ) obtained from the PL decay spectra reflected the lifetime of strongly interacting electron–hole pairs. The decreased Aτ of the N–CN photocatalyst implied a higher probability of fast dissociation of the photoexcited charge carriers (Fig. 5a and Table S2, ESI†).35 The intensity of the PL emission peak reflected the radiative recombination rate of the photogenerated charge carriers (Fig. 5b). The dramatically decreased intensity of the PL emission peak for the N–CN photocatalyst suggested inhibited recombination of the photoexcited charge carriers, which was the other reason for the enhanced photocatalytic H2 production performance. As depicted in Fig. 5c, the slope of the Nyquist plot of the N–CN photocatalyst is smaller than that of the bulk CN photocatalyst, demonstrating the decreased resistance of charge transport at the interface. Fig. 5d presents the periodic photocurrent responses of the bulk CN and N–CN photocatalysts. The increased photocurrent density of the N–CN photocatalyst was the result of the enhanced transportation of the photoexcited charge carriers. The characterization of the optical and photoelectric properties gave evidence that the improved photocatalytic activity of N–CN photocatalyst was due to the extended visible light adsorption and enhanced dissociation and migration of the photogenerated charge carriers.

It is well known that the optical and photoelectric properties of photocatalysts are primarily determined by their intrinsic electronic properties, including their electronic energy band structure and localized electron distribution. Therefore, characterization of the energy band structure and theoretical calculations were conducted to explicate the optimized optical and photoelectric properties of the N–CN photocatalyst. The band gaps of the CN and N–CN photocatalysts were determined to be 2.70 and 2.16 eV from the Tauc plot (Fig. 6a). The narrowed band gap of the N–CN photocatalyst accounted for its red-shifted adsorption edge, which favored the adsorption of incident light with lower photon energy. Fig. 6b depicts the Mott–Schottky plots of CN and N–CN photocatalysts, whose x intercepts at the tangents represented the flat band potentials (Efbvs. Ag/AgCl) and whose positive slopes confirmed the n-type semiconductor traits of the synthesized photocatalysts. The Efb (vs. Ag/AgCl) potentials of the CN and N–CN photocatalysts were estimated to −1.06 and −0.95 V, and the corresponding Efb (vs. NHE, pH = 0) potentials were derived to be −0.47 and −0.36 V, respectively. Generally, the Efb potential of the n-type semiconductor was 0.3 V more positive than the conduction band minimum (CBM) potential.36 Hence, the CBM potentials of the bulk CN and N–CN photocatalysts were identified to be −0.77 and −0.66 V, respectively. Based on the Eg values, the valence band minimum (VBM) potentials of the CN and N–CN photocatalysts were calculated to be 1.93 and 1.50 V, respectively. Combining the above results, the electronic energy band structures of the bulk CN and N–CN photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 6c. It could be observed that the introduced N3C vacancies tailored the band edge position and narrowed the band gap of the CN photocatalyst.

To explain the tail adsorption in the visible light region of the N–CN photocatalyst, theoretical calculations were carried out to visualize the role of the N3C vacancies in the energy band structure. The cell of the N–CN photocatalyst was built by introducing one N3C vacancy located in one heptazine unit. Based on the optimized configuration (Fig. 7a and d), the calculated density of states (DOS) is exhibited in Fig. 6d. The calculated narrowed band gap of the N–CN photocatalyst compared to that of the bulk CN photocatalyst was consistent with the experimental data. Additionally, a new impurity energy state emerged within the band gap, which allowed an additional band transition.37 This result enabled the absorption of photons with energies smaller than the intrinsic band gap, accounting for the appearance of tail adsorption in the visible light region of the N–CN photocatalyst. Additionally, the occupied impurity energy state formed above the valence band could accommodate the photoexcited holes, which functioned as a new transport route for photogenerated charge carriers.

Fig. 7 shows the calculated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the CN and N–CN cells, which are the counterparts of the VB and CB levels in a photocatalyst cluster.38 For the bulk CN photocatalyst, the HOMO originated from the pz orbitals of the N atoms and the LUMO primarily derived from the π/π* interaction between C–N bond orbitals (Fig. 7b and c).39 This electron distribution of the HOMO and LUMO around the heptazine motifs could lead to difficult spatial separation and high recombination probability for the photoexcited carriers. In contrast, the incorporation of N3C vacancies induced rearrangement of the electrons on the HOMO and LUMO, which was especially evident in the localization of the HOMO (Fig. 7e and f). The perturbation of the electron distribution in the HOMO and LUMO contributed to the spatial separation of the photoexcited electrons and holes for the N–CN photocatalyst, thereby accelerating the dissociation of the electron and hole pairs. On the basis of the above results, the introduced N3C vacancies tailored the electronic energy band structure and perturbed the electron distribution of the N–CN photocatalyst, resulting in optimized optical and photoelectric properties.
Conclusions
In conclusion, a facile CaCO3 template method was adopted to synthesize a porous CN photocatalyst with N3C vacancies (N–CN). The removal of the CaCO3 template contributed to a reduced number of layers and an increased number of mesopores, increasing the surface area of the N–CN photocatalyst. Simultaneously, the employment of the CaCO3 template induced the formation of N3C vacancies, which led to a narrowed band gap, impurity energy level generation, and perturbation of the electron distribution. The N–CN photocatalyst exhibited enhanced H2 evolution activity compared with bulk CN, which was attributed to the increased surface area, extended light adsorption capacity, and enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiency. This work has presented the creation of N vacancies within a CN substrate via a CaCO3 template method and demonstrated the mechanism of the enhancement of H2 production when using porous CN with N3C vacancies.
