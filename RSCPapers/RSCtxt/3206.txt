Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered potential alternatives for LIBs owing to the large availability of sodium resources, low cost, and their similar electrochemical properties to LIBs. SIBs are also considered promising options for large-scale next-generation energy storage systems. In the last few decades, extensive research has been conducted to identify suitable anode materials for the high performance of SIBs. Among the carbonaceous materials, graphene exhibited excellent physical and chemical properties for utilization as the anode material, such as high specific surface area, energy storage density, and electric conductivity. The construction of composite anode materials through the incorporation of graphene with metal oxides and metal sulfides shows promising overall performance in SIBs. This paper critically reviews the recent advancements in graphene-based composite anode materials for SIBs, focusing on synthesis and energy storage techniques.

1. Introduction
With the increase in population and urbanization, there is significant depletion in fossil fuel resources, such as coal, petroleum, and natural gases; therefore, it is important to satisfy the rapidly increasing energy demands in the most sustainable way. The increasing concerns over environmental degradation due to fossil fuel consumption have created an alarming situation, urging researchers to explore and utilize renewable energy resources such as solar, wind, and geothermal energies to fulfill the ever-increasing energy demands. Moreover, for the effective utilization of these renewable energies, development of suitable energy conservation and storage methods is essential.1 Recently, electrochemical energy storage through utilization of batteries has been gaining significant attention and researchers are extensively working on augmenting the specific energy and power density of batteries to power electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid EVs (HEVs).2 Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) possess excellent characteristics, such as high conversion efficiency, simple maintenance, stable cycle ability, adjustable power, and energy features for different grid functions.3 Sony Corporation successfully commercialized LIBs in 1991; thereafter, significant research works were conducted to establish it as the most prominent power source.4,5 LIBs are considerably commercialized and used in EVs and HEVs. In addition, grid-scale LIB prototypes with capacities in tens of megawatt hour were developed for storing renewable energy.6–8 However, the limited resources of lithium (only 0.12% corresponding to sodium and potassium as shown in Fig. 1a) have resulted in a resistance in its development, which has consequently resulted in higher costs. Moreover, the further improvement of LIBs is least anticipated as the development of LIBs has nearly reached its theoretical limits.9,10 Therefore, there is an immense need to develop economic alternatives to LIB technologies.
 Fig. 1  (a) Relative abundance of lithium (orange), sodium (gray), and potassium (blue) in the crust of the earth and (b) number of articles on graphene-based anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) published from 2010 to August 31, 2020 (data obtained from Web of Science). 
Sodium, an abundant resource (approximately 2.74%), is an alkaline metal adjacent to lithium in the elemental table; moreover, it possesses similar physiochemical properties as lithium. Owing to its abundant availability, sodium is cheaper. It is reported that the cost of sodium carbonate is approximately $200–250 per ton, which is ∼10 times less the cost of lithium carbonate (approximately $2000–2200 per ton).12 Further, both overall plant cost and cost per installed kilowatt (kW) of LIBs are more than three magnitude higher than Na-based batteries.11 Sodium has a suitable potential of −2.71 V (vs. standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) and it is more preferable in large-scale stationary grid applications where longer life cycle and lower battery cost are critical for the entire system.13 Thus, the development of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is an ideal alternative to LIBs.14 The initial studies on SIBs and LIBs were initiated side-by-side in the 1970s and 1980s; however, owing to the rapid and promising advancements in the development and successful commercialization of LIBs, the development of SIBs was largely abandoned.15–19 Further, facilities, including equipment and suitable electrolytes, were limited in terms of producing good results in SIBs. Thus, the research on SIBs has been stagnant for several years. However, since 2015, a rapid increase in the number of scientific publications focusing on SIBs has been observed, indicating that SIBs are becoming one of the most promising next-generation energy storage systems (ESSs) (Fig. 1b). Recent studies have proposed several metal oxides (MOs) and metal sulfides (MSs) anode materials capable of delivering an acceptable level of capacity. The electrochemical performances of MOs and MSs anode materials for SIBs have been well documented in Scheme 1a and b. Further, to assist in accessing these materials, we summarized the useful information concerning electrolytes (salts and solvent system) and binders based on recent reports of SIBs in Scheme 1c–h. Although, generally carbonate-based electrolytes are not suitable for SIBs while it forms relatively thick solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers on the graphite surface, which block Na+ ion transport,12 but the summery of electrolytes from graphene–MOs (Scheme 1c) and graphene–MSs (Scheme 1e) shows that the carbonate-based electrolytes systems are mostly used. Indicating a huge advantage has been achieved from graphene-based anode materials for SIBs application. Further, very common binders have been used for anode fabrication such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) which could play an important role in improving the SEI layer on the electrode surface.

SIBs consist of a positive electrode and negative electrode of sodium-inserted materials and the electrodes are connected ionically by immersion in an electrolyte containing dissolved sodium-based salts. The working principle of SIBs is illustrated in Scheme 2, which is similar to that of LIBs. During the charging process, Na+ moves from the cathode to the anode, and the converse happens during the discharging process. Considering the intercalation principle in cathodes, the chemistry of sodium and lithium is significantly similar, which signifies the possibility of using similar compounds for both LIB and SIB systems. However, the bigger size of the Na+ ions (1.02 A) when compared to that of Li+ ions (0.76 A) and its larger molecular weight (23 g mol−1 when compared to 6.9 g mol−1 for Li+) present obvious differences, which affects phase stability, transport properties, and interphase formations,20 thus leading to limited energy density.21 Therefore, variations should be expected in terms of anode materials that could adopt these properties to achieve large Na+ ion storage ability, high structural stability, and a large reversible capacity. For example, graphite is commonly used as an anode for LIBs, with a moderate capacity of ∼350 mA h g−1 at 0.1 V, versus lithium or its ions and is used to form lithium–graphite intercalation compounds in lithium cells.22 The electrochemical intercalation of Na+ ions in graphite, which is a layer-by-layer assembly of graphene sheets through π–π interaction,23–28 was first investigated with graphite/polyethylene oxide, NaCF3SO3/sodium cell in 1988.29 It was determined that Na+ ion insertion into graphite is hindered significantly owing to the larger ionic radius of Na+ ions compared to that of Li+ ions (Fig. 2a). Further, the degradation of electrode materials and electrolyte was observed during electrochemical intercalation of Na+ ions.30–32

However, this problem was solved in 2004 when graphene was first isolated layer-by-layer from graphite, and it appears to be a good candidate as an active anode in SIBs. Consequently, reduced graphene oxide (RGO),33 which is derived from chemically exfoliated graphene oxide (GO), was first reported in 2013 as a host for Na+ ions in SIBs.34 It shows remarkable electrochemical performance such as good cycle life and rate capability, which is related to the presence of defects originating from the residual oxygen-containing groups and a higher interlayer distance in graphene (0.37 nm) than in graphite (0.34 nm). Moreover, the large experimental surface area (∼1500 m2 g−1), higher electrical conductivity (∼2000 S cm−1), excellent thermal conductivity (4840–5300 W m−1 K−1), and flexibility34–36 make graphene a promising candidate for further use in SIBs as anode materials (Fig. 2b).
In recent years, researchers have designed and developed various types of composite materials for anodes, including MOs, metal phosphides (MPs), MSs, and their alloys such as Sb2O3, SnO2, Fe2O3, CuO, CuP2, NiP3, FeP4, MoS2, SnS2, CoS, NiS2 MSnO3, CoMn2O4, NiO/SnO2, FeS2/FeS, CoS2/NiS2, which are composed of graphene in the form of GO, RGO, doped graphene, or expanded graphite. However, the above-mentioned metal forms often undergo volume expansions during the charging/discharging process, which leads to poor cyclic stability. In addition, they possess low intrinsically electric conductivity and slow mitigation of Na+ ions inside the framework, which lead to lower coulombic efficiency and inadequate performance.37
Carbonaceous materials with abundant availability, excellent thermal and physical properties, and low cost have been extensively explored in recent years for composite preparation. Particularly, a two-dimensional (2D) graphene macromolecular carbon atom possesses a honeycomb structure and shows an excellent charge carrier and electron mobility of 20 m2 V−1 cm−1 and ∼15000 m2 V−1 cm−1, respectively;9 consequently, it can be considered as the best choice for composite preparation along with metal alloys, MOs, MPs, and MSs. From the perspective of commercialization, graphene-based materials satisfy all the requirements of the anode material, such as excellent cyclic stability, safety, nontoxicity, durability, and cheaper price. Thus, graphene-based composite materials were extensively explored by researchers for improving the battery performance. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there are few works reported in the literature that have comprehensively discussed the potential of all categories of anode materials (metal alloys, MOs, MPs, and MSs) that use graphene-based composites for high performance of SIBs. Considering the advantageous features of graphene-based composite materials, this state-of-the-art review provides a comprehensive summary of the most recent advancements in the graphene-based composite anodes with an elaborate discussion on the synthesis, structural configuration, and electrochemical performance of composites. Additionally, this work explores the relationship between the composite structure and electrochemical performance of the anode in SIBs. Finally, the authors present the conclusions and future perspective, which will be helpful to researchers and manufacturers in the design and development of cost-effective energy storage materials for portable electronic applications with better performance.
2. Synthesis, sodium-storing mechanism of graphene
2.1. Synthesis of graphene
Graphene with a 2D structure has a higher potential of creating more active sites for the ion carriers when compared to graphite.38 Different methods were designed and developed to synthesize graphene, such as electrochemical synthesis (Fig. 3a),39–41 CVD (Fig. 3b),42,43 thermal reduction (Fig. 3c),44,45 growing graphene on metals or SiC substrates,46,47 and liquid-phase exfoliation (Fig. 3d).48,49 Graphene can also be produced with a good yield through the reduction of GO, and this synthesis method is considered scalable and efficient.50–52 GO is a highly oxidized form of graphene, which consists of various oxygen-containing functional groups, such as carbonyl, hydroxyl, carboxyl aldehyde, ether, and epoxy groups.

These functional groups are located at the basal pane as well as at the edge of the GO nanosheet (NS), which leads to the conversion of the sp2 carbon atom of graphene into a combination of sp2 and sp3 carbon atoms in GO. Owing to the sp3 hybridization with defects, the conjugated structure of graphene changes, which decreases the strength and electric conductivity of graphene. Nevertheless, the existence of different functional groups in GO increases the process ability and promotes the application of GO as a multifunctional material. Synthesis of GO from graphite through the Hummers method53 is the most popular method which was improved further by several groups such as Marcano et al.54 and Chen et al.55,56 The GO preparation method is shown in Fig. 4. Afterwards, However, by chemical reduction, GO can be converted into RGO at room temperature or by moderate heating through the utilization of reducing agents such as hydrazine monohydrate,57 sodium borohydride,58 and hydroquinone.59 However, these chemicals are highly hazardous to the environment as well as human health and precautions must be taken while using it. Consequently, a nontoxic reduction method of RGO was prepared using ascorbic acid60,61 and electrochemical reduction at room temperature,62 where the conductivity of as-prepared RGO was determined to be 85 S cm−1 with a carbon/oxygen ratio of 23.9. Apart from chemical reduction, thermal reduction is also widely used and both the annealing temperature and the atmosphere perform important roles in the reduction of GO. Li et al.63 reported that a high annealing temperature is required to attain a good quality of RGO. Arc discharge treatment at a temperature above 2000 °C was used by Wu et al.64 for the reduction of GO; they exhibited an RGO with electric conductivity of 2000 S cm−1 and a carbon/oxygen ratio of 15–18.

2.2.1. Sodium storage in graphene. 
The morphology and structure of the carbonaceous materials have a strong effect on the efficient storage of sodium. Generally, for most of the carbonaceous materials, the mechanism of sodium storage is based on “insertion–adsorption.” Cao et al.65 studied the insertion–extraction characteristics of Li+ and Na+ ions in hollow carbon nanowires as shown in Fig. 5a. The theoretical simulation-based calculation shows that the equilibrium interplanar distance for NaC6 is higher than that of LiC6. This is due to the larger size of the Na+ ion. Thus, the Li+ ion can easily intercalate into graphite interlayers (0.335 nm); however, the Na+ ion is unable to intercalate as it must overcome a significantly higher energy barrier (0.12 eV) than Li+ ion (0.0257 eV). However, the simulation analysis indicates that if the interlayer spacings increase to 0.37 nm, the energy barrier for Na+ ion insertion drops markedly to 0.053 eV, which is sufficiently low for the Na+ ion to overcome. This clearly indicates that the exfoliated graphene and/or GO can be a good host for Na+ ions. It was demonstrated that Na+ ions exhibit similar electrochemical characteristics as Li+ ions in graphite insertion under low potential region. Qiu et al.66 reported that the reaction occurring in the high potential range (0.2–1 V) can be ascribed to the transfer of charge on the surface of the graphitic clusters, whereas the reaction in the case of the low potential range (0–0.2 V) can be attributed to the insertion of Na+ ion in the graphitic carbon interlayer (Fig. 5b). In addition, the theoretical simulations further proved that the Na+ ion can be easily inserted into the layered carbon with an interplanar distance of marginally above 0.37 nm. This mechanism of Na+ ion insertion is governed by the diffusion-controlled intercalation process (DCIP). Owing to the larger atomic size and sluggish diffusion ability of Na+ ions, DCIP does not significantly contribute to the high rate capacity.

KGaA). Inset: illustration of the insertion of Na+ and Li+ ions mechanism into carbon. 
Moreover, the surface-induced capacitive process (SCP) with double-layer capacitance along with the adsorption of Na+ ions into the voids, defects, and functional groups initiates faster diffusion of Na+ ions and enhanced structural stability in the long term. Li et al.67 designed and developed a composite anode of hierarchical graphene/amorphous carbon and explored the contributions of both DICP and SCP. The authors reported that both DICP and SCP can work in conjunction to provide high capacities, whereas only SCP can handle the poor diffusion of Na+ ion in high rates. In 2013, Wang et al.34 investigated the utilization of RGO as an anode material for SIBs, and the results revealed superior cycle life, rate capability, and electrochemical behaviors. The RGO with an interlayer distance of 0.371 nm exhibited superior sodium-storage behavior. The results showed that the RGO anode has a capacity of 174 mA h g−1 (current density = 0.04 A g−1) and reversible capacity of 95.6 mA h g−1 (current density = 1 A g−1). The augmented electrode performance was owing to the unique structure of the RGO, which significantly decreases the diffusion length of Na+ ions. Although, RGO exhibited excellent electrochemical performance when compared to the graphite, it still shows less reversible capacity than other anode materials. Thus, the Na+ ion storage characteristic of graphene-based materials can be further improved by preparing novel three-dimensional (3D) porous graphene with interconnected structure, heteroatom-doped graphene, and defective graphene.


2.2.2. Heteroatoms doping effect in graphene for sodium storage. 
The current research also implies that the heteroatoms (N, S, P, B etc.)-doped graphene materials are suitable to be anode materials of SIBs due to increasing defect sites which act as active sites in graphene materials for Na+ ion storage and thus achieve higher sodium storage capacity.68–71 Defects from heteroatoms doping in graphene not only can enhance the overall electrochemical activity but also regulate the interfacial stability. Further, the defect structure exhibits positive effect on high reaction kinetics. A comparative study between sulfur-doped graphene and doped-free graphene was conducted by Deng et al.68 In their study, they prepared a cellular architecture of sulfur-doped graphene using thiourea by gelation as self-standing electrode for SIBs application. It showed 377 mA h g−1 stable discharge capacity at 100 mA g−1 current density which was much higher than that of doped-free graphene. Consequently, Islam et al.70 have also reported a free-standing sulfur-doped graphene foam by using the simple self-assembly of polymer chains on GO by thermal treatment to generate electron-dense active sites. The SGF delivered first charge capacities of 325 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 in SIB. In the meantime, Xu et al.69 have prepared and introduced to SIB a nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped graphene which shown improved rate performance (144 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1), and good cycling stability (153 mA h g−1 after 5000 cycles at 5000 mA g−1).


2.2.3. Effect of electrolyte for sodium storage in graphene. 
The SIBs performance is also subjected to the solvation structure of Na+ ions by electrolyte molecules and critically important in battery chemistry. The Na+ solvation structure plays a critical role in the reaction kinetics and cycling stability of graphene electrode. The type and location of the anions plays a critical role in intercalation which determining the Na storage performance.72–74 The SEI is a nanometer thick layer which formed on electrode surfaces from decomposition products of electrolytes. The SEI allows ion transport and blocks electrons in order to prevent further electrolyte decomposition and ensure continued electrochemical reactions. Thus, the unstable, thick and electrically insulating SEI layer may result in the lower reversible capacity and cycle stability.75 However, the multilayered graphene acts as stabilizer of SEI layer upon the huge volume changes of anode during cycling.76,77 For example, Kim et al.76 have prepared an 8-layers graphene by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) which introduced as an SEI layer. Result showed that 8-layers graphene as SEI was more stable and achieved improved charge capacities. Further, Hu et al.77 showed that the chemically bonded antimony and multilayer graphene can stabilize the SEI upon the large volume changes during cycling. Although, it is confirmed that the multilayered graphene forms the favorable SEI, but the number of layers may not be optimized yet. Therefore, further research is required on it.

3. Graphene-based transition metal oxide composite
In recent years, significant attention has been focused on the development of MO–graphene anode materials for SIBs.78,79 Owing to various advantages such as versatile nanostructures, multiple surface plans, and large interatomic space in crystal structures, single MOs80–89 and alloyed oxides90–99 composed of graphene were designed and synthesized as anode materials for SIBs. The electrochemical properties of graphene-based MOs anode materials for SIBs are summarized in Table 1.

Electrochemical conversion reactions of metal oxides provide a new avenue to build high capacity anodes for SIBs. Conversion reactions by utilizing the multioxidation states of transition-metal bring added capacity that can significantly increase the capacity ceiling of the cell. However, the poor rate performance and cyclability from conversion type anode remains a big challenge for SIBs applications due to the sluggish kinetics and irreversible structural change during cycles.82 Therefore, the addition of graphene can be a good choice for not only increasing conductivity to facile fast reaction kinetics but also increasing the flexibility to allow volume expansion during reparative conversion. Li et al.82 has taken this strategy and prepared Fe2O3 on RGO where the Fe2O3 crystallites were uniformly anchored. Thus, RGO provides a highly conductive framework to facilitate electron transport and a flexible matrix to buffer the volume change of the material during cycling which resultant in very high reversible capacity and better stability. Further, the SnO2@G100 anode which prepared by one-pot hydrothermal method Na-storage through conversion reaction along with partial alloying reaction while comparative study showed the poor Na-storage from graphene-free SnO2 NPs. Although, intercalation chemistry provides a limited Na-storage capacity of an anode material, the breakthroughs in performance of current battery application comes from the intercalation reaction. However, the graphene addition cab be very effective approach to improve capacity along with allowing huge volume expansion from bigger sized Na+ ions during intercalation. For instance, Chen et al.101 have Introduced a novel composite of Li4Ti5O12 nanofibers confined with highly conductive 3D-interconnected graphene framework is designed and fabricated for Na-storage which shown high capacity due to the synergistic effect and super-long cycle life (up to 12000 cycles) due to allowing huge volume expansion from 3D graphene. Further, further results suggest that the kinetics of Na+ intercalation into Li4Ti5O12/graphene becomes satisfactory.
3.1. Iron-based oxides composite
Fe2O3 is the most investigated oxide among all iron oxides and has a high theoretical capacity, high abundance, and nontoxic property. Li et al.102 reported amorphous Fe2O3/graphene NSs (Fe2O3@GNS) as a promising anode composite material for SIBs. The electrochemical performance of this anode composite is superior to that of bare Fe2O3 in terms of sodium-storage properties owing to a synergistic effect; moreover, the conversion reactions, as proposed in equations (i)103 and (ii),104 occur simultaneously. Thus, Na+ cointercalation in graphite is facilitated by forming ternary graphite intercalation compounds by reduction of graphite.105 6Na+ + 6e− + Fe2O3 ↔ 3Na2O + 2Fe.(i) Na+ + y sol v + Cn + e− ↔ Na+ (sol v)yCn(ii)
Li et al.106 showed that the simple addition of GO with Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) can be a breakthrough for mass transfer of Na+ during the operation of the batteries (Fig. 6a). The Fe2O3/GO composite, which has a higher specific surface area (SSA; 44 m2 g−1) than the bare Fe2O3 (19 m2 g−1), was employed as the anode for SIBs. Nearly stable reversible specific capacity was recorded (420 mA h g−1) after 100 cycles at 0.1C. Importantly, Fe2O3/GO composite shows a good rate capability at various current densities (Fig. 6b). Comparatively better battery performances are obtained from the enwrapped Fe2O3 NPs as the flexible GO creates porosity between GO layers, which leads to facile mass transfer between the electrolyte and the anode, and improves electronic transports. Further, GO offers the structural stability and mechanical integrity of the Fe2O3/GO composite. RGO was used as a substrate for growing rhombohedral α-Fe2O3 NPs with diameters of 4–8 nm using a facile microwave method.107 Similarly, the authors showed that a controlled addition of RGO can improve the battery performance and achieve ∼2.7 times higher SSA. However, when 30 wt% RGO was introduced, the reversible capacity reached a maximum of 389.3 mA h g−1 for fluorinated graphite FG-30 sample, which was higher than that of the pure Fe2O3 sample (287.3 mA h g−1) and 50 wt% FG-50 sample (324.2 mA h g−1). The FG-30 electrode achieved a higher capacity of 289 mA h g−1 than those of other tested electrodes after 50 cycles along with 99% coulombic efficiency after 10 cycles (Fig. 6c). As mentioned previously, similar-sized amorphous Fe2O3 NPs (5 nm), Fe2O3@GNS was prepared by Li et al.102 Their investigation suggested that Fe2O3 NPs were grafted by the strong “C–O–Fe” oxygen-bridge bond (Fig. 6d). The amorphous Fe2O3 NPs in Fe2O3@GNS provided strong interfacial interaction caused by C–O–Fe bonding to relieve the volume change during insertion/extraction of Na+ ions along with more space and transmission channels for Na+ ions to reduce the diffusion paths, which resulted in a higher capacity of 440 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 current density.

Nitrogen-doped graphene NS (N-GNS) was also used along with Fe2O3 for composite preparation.108 The Fe2O3/N-GNS was synthesized using a simple hydrothermal method. Interestingly, the size of Fe2O3 NPs was lowered to ∼51 nm, and they were tightly confined onto the N-GNS upon addition of N-GNS when compared to Fe2O3 NPs in Fe2O3/GNS (1–2 μm). This improved the aggregation property of Fe2O3 NPs and minimized the volume expansion during insertion/extraction of Na+ ions, which resulted in a good reversible capacity of ∼306 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after 50 cycles.
However, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve of Fe2O3 NP-based materials produces an irreversible peak at ∼0.5 V (vs. Na/Na+), which originates from the irreversible formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer; moreover, the pronounced reduction peak at ∼0 V (vs. Na/Na+) is attributed to the reduction Fe3+ → Fe0 in the first reduction sweep. In the oxidation sweep of the same cycle, two tiny peaks were visualized at ∼0.7 and ∼1.4 V (vs. Na/Na+), corresponding to the double-step oxidation of Fe0 → Fe2+ and Fe2+ → Fe3+, respectively.108,109 In the subsequent cycles, all peaks appeared, except the peak at ∼0.5 V (vs. Na/Na+), which was due to the irreversible phase transformation during initial Na+ insertion/extraction process.
Fe3O4 is another promising iron-based graphene composite material for SIBs. Zhang et al.110 prepared ultrasmall Fe3O4 NPs (∼3 nm) on RGO through a single-step high-temperature coprecipitation approach using thiol-functionalized poly(methacrylic acid) as the capping agent and ammonia/hydrazine as the reducing agent. The as-prepared RGO Fe3O4 composite (RGOF-3) produced a higher reversible capacity of 204 mA h g−1 than the RGO/Fe3O4 (57 mA h g−1 at the second cycle) at 40 mA g−1 current density. This indicated the influence of the capping agent (Fig. 7a).

However, the CV curve for the sodium-storage behavior of Fe3O4-based samples is similar to that of Fe2O3. The formation of the SEI by the production of a broad cathodic peak at ∼0.5 V in the first scan111 and the reduction of Fe2+/3+ to Fe0 and Na2O (Fig. 7b) was observed.112,113 In the anodic process, the peak at ∼1.5 V corresponded to the reoxidation of Fe0 to Fe2+/3+ and decomposition of Na2O.112,113 The overall reversible electrochemical reaction for SIBs can be expressed as follows:111,112 Fe3O4 + 8Na+ + 8e− ↔ 3Fe0 + 4Na2O(iii)
Ding et al.113 assembled a full cell with Fe3O4@graphite/Na2.4Fe1.8(SO4)3, which produced good energy density of ∼300 W h kgcathode−1 with a working voltage of 3.2 V. It showed a good cycle stability (70% at 500 cycles under 0.1C) and rate capability (59 mA gcathode−1 at 10C, where 1C = 108 mA gcathode−1). Binary-alloyed CoFe2O4 NPs were prepared on graphene (CoFe2O4/graphene) by Li et al.,114 which showed better reversible capacity of 330 mA h g−1 at 0.05C after 75 cycles with good rate capability of 170 mA h g−1 at 1C. By merely replacing the cometal, Zhang et al.115 prepared MgFe2O4/RGO (20 wt%) using a facile microwave method that exhibited an improved reversible capacity of 347.5 mA h g−1 at 0.05C.
FeOF is another type of iron-based graphene composite material that was synthesized and used for achieving high-performance SIBs owing to a high theoretical capacity of ∼885 mA h g−1.116,117 A 13 wt% RGO containing FeOF/RGO nanocomposite was prepared through solvothermal treatment with 1-propanol, which showed discharge capacities of ∼283.2 mA h g−1 initially and 229.4 mA h g−1 at the 50th cycle with superior capacity fading rate of 0.23% per cycle. However, the Na+ storage reaction experiences insertion and conversion steps, as shown below.116 FeOF + Na+ + 1e− → NaFeOF(iv) NaFeOF + 2Na+ + 2e− → Fe0 + NaF + Na2O(v)
3.2. Sn-based oxide composites
Sn-based composite materials were intensively investigated as anode catalysts for SIBs owing to their ecofriendliness, abundant availability, and relatively high theoretical capacity (847 mA h g−1 in the form of Na15Sn4).118 However, the significant change in the volume (approximately 420%) of Sn-based anodes is the primary obstacle which leads to pulverization of the active particles, loss of electrical contact, and finally, rapid capacity fading. Thus, the of Sn/graphene composite preparation is one of the best strategies to solve this problem and promote the practical application for SIBs.119
Among Sn oxides, SnO2 is considered an ideal anode material for SIBs because of its large theoretical specific capacity (667 mA h g−1)100,120 achieved through a two-step reaction for Na+ storage in the SnO2 electrode (eqn (vi) and (vii)).119 Through both conversion (eqn (viii)) and alloying (equation ix) reactions, a theoretical capacity of 1378 mA h g−1 can be achieved during the sodiation process.
However, SnO2 undergoes severe volume change and suffers from poor electrical conductivity, which results in poor battery performance. To improve the battery performance, Xie et al.121 prepared a 3D SnO2/graphene aerogel and employed it for SIBs, which facilitated electrode–electrolyte interaction and created efficient electron pathways within the graphene networks (Fig. 7c). Through electrochemical investigation, the authors observed the formation of metallic Sn during Na+ storage based on a one-step reaction (eqn (viii)).121,122 SnO2 + 4Na+ + 4e− → 2Na2O + NaxSn(vi) NaxSn ↔ Sn0 + xNa+ + xe−(vii) SnO2 + 4Na+ + 4e− → 2Na2O + Sn0(viii) Sn0 + xNa+ + xe− ↔ NaxSn (x = 3:75)(ix)
For further improvement, nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) was also introduced123,124 along with SnO2. For example, SnO2/NG was synthesized through a one-step nitrogen doping of graphene along with the simultaneous formation of SnO2 NPs. The as-prepared SnO2/NG showed a higher initial reversible capacity of 339 mA h g−1, which was significantly higher than that of doped-free graphene-based SnO2/G composite. Further, the SnO2/NG exhibited superior capacities of 283 mA h g−1 in the 100th cycle, which is higher than that of SnO2/G (188 mA h g−1). In addition, nitrogen-doped carbon was also introduced into SnO2@graphene/nitrogen-doped carbon preparation using the microwave method,124 which achieved a capacity of over 423 mA h g−1 after 180 cycles at 5C. The improved battery performance was due to the improved electron transfer efficiency resulting from nitrogen doping.
Both the electrochemical and physical properties of SnO2-based nanomaterials are strongly related to their size and shape; moreover, the smaller size of SnO2 NPs can be homogeneously dispersed onto the 2D graphene substrate whereas it is difficult to prepare and stabilize smaller NPs. Wang et al.125 prepared spherical SnO2 quantum dots (QDs)/graphene aerogel (GA) with dimensions of 2–5 nm with no surfactant and/or reducing agent and employed it in the SIBs as anode material. The as-prepared SnO2 QDs/GA showed a higher reversible capacity of 319 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after 50 cycles, which is significantly higher than the capacity of SnO2 and GA. The better stability is due to the GA, which protected the SnO2 QDs from volume variation and agglomeration. Chen et al.126 prepared few-layered graphene (FLG) sheets with 2–4 nm sized SnO2 NPs through a synergetic effect of two reactions. Both the reduction of GO and formation of SnO2 NPs were achieved successfully in a one-step reaction, and SnO2 NPs were firmly bonded on the graphene sheets through Sn–O–C bonding. The highly dispersed 1 nm sized SnO2 NPs were prepared onto graphene or carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using supercritical CO2 (SCCO2) fluid by Chang et al.127 The electrochemical result showed that the reversible discharge (desodiation) capacity produced by SnO2/GNS-SCCO2 (400 mA h g−1) (Fig. 7d) was superior to that produced by SnO2/GNS-air (280 mA h g−1). The SCCO2 process produced smaller SnO2 NPs with less agglomeration, resulting in higher utilization, which led to high specific capacity. Through several influential experiments, the researchers confirmed that the sluggish Sn–sodium alloying/dealloying reaction is responsible for this phenomenon (Fig. 7e). Further, it was determined that the trapping of sodium in the SEI layer results in an efficiency loss after the first cycle.128
Unique hollow 3D SnO2@carbon core–shell spheres on diazonium functionalized GO were prepared using a simple microwave treatment.129 The as-prepared SnO2@C-RGO anode showed a good electrochemical performance with high capacity of 493.12 mA h g−1 and large coulombic efficiency (96.2% after 150 cycles). For improving the kinetics for Na+ transfer, SnOx–Sn secondary microgranules on FLG ((SnOx–Sn)@FLG) was synthesized by oxygen plasma-assisted milling.130 The in situ-formed FLG and residual Sn NPs can improve the electrical conductivity of the composite and relieve the volume change during cycling, which results in a high reversible capacity (448 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1) with superior stability up to 250 cycles (316.5 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1). Recently, with a similar aim, Ma et al.131 prepared ternary SnO2@Sn core–shell structure on nitrogen-doped GA, which achieved marginally improved initial discharge capacity of 448.5 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1. Moreover, Wen et al.132 prepared ternary composites, i.e., MSnO3 (M = Mn, Co, Zn) loaded RGO composites, through hydrothermal and calcination methods. In comparison, samples containing RGO were superior to those of bare MSnO3 in terms of the conductivity, discharge capacity, cycle ability, and rate performance.
3.3. Ti-based oxides composite
Ti-based oxides are particularly interesting as anodes owing to their reasonable operation voltage, cost, and nontoxicity.133,134 Recently, Ti-based oxides have exhibited excellent Na+ storage ability, which demonstrates their potential as high-performance anode electrodes for SIBs. However, Ti-based anodes have low conductivity and large volume variation during charging/discharging in addition to poor theoretical capacity (less than 200 mA h g−1). For example, the first report on TiO2-based anode (amorphous TiO2 nanotube) for SIBs delivered a reversible capacity of 150 mA h g−1.135 Combining it with a conductive material such as graphene can achieve high capacity because the graphene can form highly conductive networks to promote electron transfer.136,137 Thus, Liu et al.138 prepared an anode material with ultrasmall TiO2-coated RGO for SIBs using a one-pot hydrolysis method, which produced a discharge specific capacity of 248.5 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.05 A g−1. Specifically, it showed better rate performance (118 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1) with cycle stability of 127.7 mA h g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 after 1000 cycles. Similarly, graphene-supported porous TiO2 nanospheres (RGO–TiO2) were prepared through a facile hydrothermal process with heat treatment in a tube furnace (550 °C in an Ar-atmosphere) by Yang et al.139 The as-prepared RGO–TiO2 offered not only abundant electrochemically active surface sites and ionic channels, which confirmed the high utilization of the TiO2 NPs, but also high electronic conduction; moreover, the aggregation of the TiO2 NPs during charge/discharge process was prevented by the RGO. Consequently, the RGO–TiO2 anode produced a capacity of 300 mA h g−1 and cycling stability (208 mA h g−1 over 300 cycles) with high rate capability (123.1 mA h g−1 at 4 A g−1). Meanwhile, approximately 4 nm thick TiO2 NSs on graphene (TiO2 NSs-G) were prepared by Shoaib et al.140 for achieving a high current rate (125 mA h g−1 at 3.2C) and long cycle life (200 mA h g−1 after 700th cycle with capacity attenuation of 0.033% per cycle) (Fig. 8a) of SIBs. Metal–organic framework-derived graphene at nitrogen-doped carbon with TiO2 NPs (G-NC@TiO2) has also shown a significantly stable cycle performance (capacity retention of 93% after 5000 cycles), which is reflected by the charge/discharge profile (Fig. 8b).141 Kang et al.142 developed a TiO2/nitrogen-doped open pore channeled graphene, which showed a high reversible capacity of 405 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles at 0.05C due to the facile transfer of Na+ to each interlayered graphene sheet with increased ion diffusivity through open pores in the channeled graphene (Fig. 8c). Yeo et al.143 created a chemical bond to provide strong electrostatic interaction between the –COO− and –O− groups of the GO sheets and the surface of the –NH3+ group functionalized TiO2 nanofibers (NFs). Using this strategy, high coulombic efficiency (99.7% from the 2nd to the 200th cycle) was achieved at a high 5C rate.

Na2Ti3O7 (NTO) nanostructures in the form of spheres144 and nanowires/NFs145−147 were studied to create a good composite with graphene as anode materials for SIBs. In the form of a sphere, the NTO nanostructure showed a comparatively high capacity of 135 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 and over 650 cycles. The hollow spheres were employed to prevent the restacking of RGO and optimize the Na+ transportation at electrode level (Fig. 9a). In the nanowires/NF form, NTO–RGO composite delivered a reversible capacity of 134 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 100 mA g−1. The addition of NG QDs (N-GQD) improved the battery performances and cycle stability (capacity decreased at 92.5% after 1000 cycles with no coulombic efficiency (100%)). The following equation might occur during the Na+ insertion/extraction process (Fig. 9b).145,146 Na2Ti3O7 + xNa+ + xe− ↔ Na2+xTi3O7 (0 < x < 3.5 or 3)(x)

Xu et al.148 prepared a lithium-based freestanding electrode composed of carbon-coated Li4Ti5O12 and RGO for SIBs and achieved a high capacity of 166 mA h g−1 at 1C and superior cyclic performance of 114 mA h g−1 at 2C after 600 cycles.
3.4. Sb-based oxides composite
Several forms of SbOx such as Sb2O3,149,150 Sb2O4,151,152 Sb4O5Cl2,153 SbVO4 (ref. 154) were studied as composite anode materials along with graphene for SIBs owing to their high theoretical capacity of 660 mA h g−1 to form Na3Sb and a safe operating potential of ∼0.4 V versus Na+/sodium.155 However, Sb2O4 possesses a high theoretical capacity of 1227 mA h g−1 as it accommodates Na+ through conversion as presented by the following alloying reactions.78 Sb2O4 + 8Na+ + 8e− → 2Sb + 4Na2O(xi) 2Sb + 6Na+ + 6e− → 2Na3Sb(xii)
However, the practical applications of SbOx are limited as the conversion reaction suffers from large voltage hysteresis, low reversibility, and high redox potential. Thus, to solve these problems, conductive additives such as graphene are necessary, which enhances the electrochemical performances of SbOx nanostructures. For example, the RGO/Sb2O4 composite was prepared as an anode for SIBs by Ramakrishnan et al.,152 where the RGO sheets not only served as a buffer layer to accommodate the volume expansion of Sb2O4 NPs but also acted as a conductive substrate to facilitate charge transport. A reversible capacity of 89 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 12.2 A g−1 was achieved, signifying its good rate capability due to the addition of RGO sheets. Interestingly, Hwang et al.150 showed a mechanical conversion of Sb2O3 to metallic Sb and wrapped it with graphene with the help of Zn as a metallic slid-state reductant (Fig. 9c). The as-prepared m-Sb@Gn showed better capacity retention at just 12% after 500 cycles at 1C.
3.5. Other metal oxide composites
Mn-based oxide materials are used in SIB systems as Mn-oxide materials have low cost and are environment friendly. However, Mn-oxide materials are widely used as cathodes, whereas reports on their use as anodes are limited for SIBs.9 However, MnO,83 Na2MnSiO4,94 ZnMn2O4,99 and CoMn2O4156 prepared with graphene were investigated as anodes for SIBs.
Niobium oxide and graphene composites such as Nb2O5−x@rGO157 and Nb2O5 NCs/rGO158 are also rarely used as anodes for SIBs. However, they showed promising stability and rate capacity. For example, the black Nb2O5−x@rGO demonstrated significantly stable discharge capacity of 150 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 2000 cycles at 100% coulombic efficiency. Further, high specific capacity was maintained (123 mA h g−1) at 3 A g−1.
A graphene-based vanadium oxide hydrate microsphere showed a high discharge capacity of 336.1 mA h g−1 for the second cycle with a reversible capacity retained at 303.1 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles.159 The NiCo2O4 nanowire/RGO composites have a capacity of 422.1 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1.160 However, binary oxide-based alloyed composite, NiO/SnO2@RGO, exhibited a moderately low capacity of ∼250 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after 40 cycles.161
3.6. Alloyed metal oxide composites
Alloyed metal oxide composed with graphene is an interesting material for the anode in SIBs. Due to the larger ionic radius of Na+ ion which leads to higher volume change upon cycling and lowering energy density, a great deal of effort has been made in search suitable materials for SIBs including alloyed metal oxide-based composite materials. Huge vacancy and defect in crystals, tunable band gap, better conductivity and well-defined crystal structure make alloyed materials more advantageous for anode in SIBs.162–165 For example, Wang et al.162 have prepared Fe2O3/Fe3O4/NG nanocomposite for SIBs application to facilitate Na+ ion diffusion. As a result, Fe2O3/Fe3O4/NG anode exhibited specific capacity up to 362 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and stability than Fe3O4/NG anode due to the abundant Fe–O–C moieties which stabilized the structural integrity and enhanced the charge transfer. Similarly, Mn0.1-Fe2.9O4/G,92 Cd2GeO4/G163 and NiCo2O4@G164 nanocomposites are shown good performances. The zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-derived polyhedron ZnCo2O4 on RGO98 and it showed higher initial discharge capacity (407 mA h g−1) which was almost double tan that of polyhedron ZnCo2O4 (214.6 mA h g−1) at a current density of 100 mA g−1.
4. Graphene-based transition metal sulfide composites
Various MSs with graphene composite as anode materials were designed and synthesized for SIBs.166–175 MSs are more advantageous than the corresponding MOs. The formation of MSs by the replacement of oxygen with lower electronegative sulfur results in higher electrochemical reactivity than the corresponding MOs. Further, the M–S bonds are typically weaker when compared to the corresponding M–O bonds, which could be kinetically favorable for conversion reactions with metal ions such as Na+.12 However, when considering MSs as anode materials, the inherent volume change and poor electronic conductivity result in poor cycling stability, large decay of capacity, and inferior rate performance, which are still unresolved.79 Further, it is critical to explore systems with low working potential, large reversible capacity, and high structural stability. Composite preparation of MSs with highly conducive graphene solves these problems effectively. The electrochemical properties of graphene-based MSs anode materials for SIBs are summarized in Table 2.

4.1. MoS2 composite
Among the various MSs, MoS2 with its graphite-like layered structure has attracted considerable interest and has been widely investigated for SIBs as it is a suitable host material which allows reversible and rapid Na+ insertion and extraction (as Na+ is ∼55% larger in radius than Li+). The large interlayer spacing of MoS2 (6.15 Å) when compared to graphite (3.35 Å) can dramatically enhance the Na+ storage capacity in layered MoS2.176,177 Sun et al.178 prepared layered MoS2/GNS hybrid material using a two-step approach of ball-milling and exfoliation of commercial bulky MoS2 and graphite. The as-prepared MoS2/GNSs exhibit remarkably high rate capability (284 and 201 mA h g−1 at 20 and 50 A g−1, respectively) with excellent cycling stability resulting in capacity retention of 95% after 250 cycles at 0.3 A g−1. Typically, the Na+ storage mechanism of MoS2 consists of two steps. The intercalation/deintercalation of Na+ into/from MoS2 interlayers occurs at above 0.4 V (eqn (xiii)); then, a conversion reaction occurs below 0.4 V (eqn (xiv)),179 as shown below. MoS2 + xNa+ + xe− ↔ NaxMoS2(xiii) NaxMoS2 + (4 − x)Na+ + (4 − x)e− ↔ Mo + 2Na2S(xiv)
Li et al.180 prepared vertically oriented MoS2 on nitrogenous RGO sheets (VO-MoS2/N-RGO) using the sol–gel process and the subsequent annealing process (Fig. 10a) to solve the undesirable electrochemical activity that arises from the deformation of MoS2 layered structure during repeated Na+ intercalation. The higher sheet density and lower height were determined to be beneficial for high-density Na+ intercalation, whereas the higher density of MoS2 sheets enhanced the specific energy density; moreover, the short length of VO-MoS2 offers fast charging/discharging process due to shortening of Na+ diffusion paths (Fig. 10b). A similar result was observed in the study by Xie et al.,181 where the researchers also determined that an increase in heterointerfacial areas is beneficial for achieving a higher Na+ storage capacity and is favorable for the cycling performance of the MoS2/RGO, which is prepared with a high amount of phosphomolybdic acid, when compared to that of the bare MoS2. Singh et al.176 prepared a layered freestanding paper composed of few-layer MoS2 and RGO for SIBs as a self-standing flexible electrode. They also observed the sodiation process through several influential processes. In X-ray diffraction patterns, the sharp peak for the (002) plane of MoS2 at 14° appeared broadened after sodiation, which indicates a degradation of the MoS2 structure, most likely due to a conversion-type reaction with Na+. Further, a broad Mo peak at 29° and sodium–sulfur peak at 72° also suggest a successful sodiation process (Fig. 10c).

KGaA); (c) X-ray diffraction pattern of 60MoS2 electrode before and after first discharge cycle (0.01 V). Broadened MoS2 (JCPDS #37-1492), RGO (JCPDS #01-0646), Mo (JCPDS #01-1207), and Na2S (JCPDS #65-0525) peaks can be observed in the sodiated electrode, (reproduced with permission from ref. 182, Copyright 2014 American Chemical Society). 
It is well known that the shape of the nanoarchitecture is an important factor for superior electrochemical activity. Thus, several researchers have created nanoflower-shaped MoS2 on graphene for enhancing Na+ storage.183–185 The hierarchical flowery morphology with layered graphene wrapping reserves adequate space for achieving volume expansion. These advantages not only allow fast Na+ storage at high current density but also improve the structural stability after insertion/extraction of a large amount of Na+. Further, expanded interlayer spacing,186 addition of NG,187 C–O–Mo chemical bonds formation,188 and microwave-assisted synthesis189 were introduced for solving the large volume change over charge–discharge that leads to mechanical failure, low capacity, poor rate, and cycling performance. Moreover, mixed MS was combined with graphene by Jiang et al.190 The ternary hybrid structure MoS2/SnS2–graphene sheet exhibited reversible capacity of 655 mA h g−1 at 0.15 A g−1 for 100 cycles along with good rate capability (340 mA g−1 at 6C).
4.2. Sn-based sulfide composites
SnS2/graphene composites have generated extensive interest owing to their low cost and high theoretical capacity with combined conversion (eqn (xv) and (xvi)) and alloying (eqn (xvi)) electrochemical reactions.191,192 Further, SnS2 consists of covalently bonded S–Sn–S trilayer moiety, which is separated by a relatively large van der Waals interaction. Moreover, a large interlayer d-spacing (5.90 Å) allows the access of Na+ for facile diffusion and insertion/extraction. SnS2 + Na+ + e− ↔ NaSnS2(xv) NaSnS2 + 3Na+ + 3e− ↔ 2Na2S + Sn(xvi) Sn + xNa+ + xe− ↔ NaxSn (x = 3.75)(xvii)
Zheng et al.193 prepared 20–30 nm sized SnS2 NPs on poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) functionalized 3D RGO (3DRGO) for SIBs in which SnS2 NPs were encapsulated by the graphene layers with the assistance of PDDA. Consequently, the SnS2/3DRGO achieved a remarkable cycling performance (75.4% after 700 cycles at 2 A g−1) and high reversible capacity (753.8 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1). Comparatively, smaller sized (2–4 nm) SnS2 QDs on K+-assisted S-doped graphene (K-SnS2@SG) anode material was designed and synthesized by Jin et al.194 to shorten the transfer and diffusion path of Na+, which is beneficial for rapid reactions. Here, the addition of K+ is beneficial to the dispersion of a few layers of graphene by electrostatic adsorption of K+ on the negatively charged GO, which created a repulsive force resulting in the separation of graphene from each layer with less agglomeration; this produced a high reversible capacity of 743 mA h g−1 at 45 mA g−1 and superior rate capability (236 mA h g−1 at 27 A g−1). Later, Fan et al.195 introduced nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped graphene with SnS2 by using the aerogel preparation approach. They observed that sulfur doping along with nitrogen results in more electron-rich graphene, which causes polarization between the surfaces and SnS2 nanocrystal, resulting in a strong electronic coupling between them, termed the “bridging effect” (Fig. 11a).

As the layered structure is more favorable to the Na+ insertion/extraction, the exfoliated-SnS2 nanoplates were restacked on graphene by hydrolysis of butyllithium-assisted lithiated SnS2 followed by a facile hydrothermal method in acidulated deionized water.196 According to the equations below, the produced hydrogen flow is the driving force for exfoliating the SnS2 layers. For better electrochemical performance, layered SnS2/graphene composites were synthesized by different groups.197–199 SnS2 + n-BuLi → LiSnS2 + 1/2C8H18(xviii) LiSnS2 + H2O → (SnS2)exfoliated + LiOH + 1/2H2(xix)
Moreover, certain researchers attempted to improve the electrochemical performances by creating ternary composites such as SnS2/Sb2S3@RGO200 and GNS@MoS2@SnS2.201 For example, the GNS@MoS2@SnS2 exhibited good rate performance with a capacity of 567 mA h g−1 at 4 A g−1, which could be ascribed to the improvement of Na+ diffusion kinetics with the assistance of four-electron-transfer-based conversion reaction for Na+ storage in MoS2, as shown below. MoS2 + 4Na+ + 4e− → 2Na2S + Mo(xx)
Wu et al.202 proposed SnS (SnS–C) nanocomposite anode materials for SIB based on combined conversion (xxi) and alloying (xvii) reactions. SnS + 2Na+ + 2e− ↔ Na2S + Sn(xxi)
The SnS–C composite was prepared using a simple ball-milling process; it has a better SnS NPs crystalline structure and good carbon coating. These physical characteristics assure the electrochemical utilization along with the structural integrity during insertion/extraction of Na+. Then, superlattice-like SnS/NG with Sn–S–C moiety was introduced as an anode material for SIBs.203 The SnS is sandwiched between the NG layers enabling enlarged SnS interlayer spacing with strong interaction between adjacent SnS and NG layers by forming Sn–S–C bonding. This approach facilitates the Na+ diffusion and insertion/extraction with rapid kinetics at the conductive SnS/NG anode. Xiong et al.204 prepared durable SnS NPs on PDDA-driven positively charged NG (SnS/3DNG) by utilizing the electrostatic attraction to [SnS3]2−, which maintained an unprecedented capacity retention rate of 87.1% for 1000 cycles at 2.0 A g−1. The SnS/3DNG anode in a full SIB with Na3V2(PO4)3/C (Fig. 11b) as the cathode showed a good stability and rate capacity.
4.3. Sb2S3-based composite
Owing to its high reversibility,205 good reaction kinetics,206 and large theoretical capacity of 946 mA h g−1 obtained by accommodating approximately 12 Na+ ions based on both the conversion (eqn (xxii)) and alloying (eqn (xxiii)) reactions, the Sb2S3 (and/or graphene composite) has recently received considerable attention as an anode for SIBs. Sb2S3 + 6Na+ + 6e− → 2Sb + 3Na2S(xxii) 2Sb + 6Na+ + 6e− → 2Na3Sb(xxiii)
Pan et al.207 reported an ionic liquid (IL)-assisted Sb2S3/RGO for solving the problems of low capacity and poor rate performance. The addition of IL increased the conductivity and cooperation between the small sized Sb2S3 and RGO, resulting in a high capacity of 687.7 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1. Moreover, Xu et al.208 prepared the Sb2S3/RGO containing 10 wt% RGO using a one-step hydrothermal process that maintained a reversible capacity of 581.2 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after 50 cycles. The in situ 3D SnS/NG composite was synthesized using nitrogen-doped graphene and SnCl4·5H2O as a precursor of Sn4+.209 Consequently, the discharge and charge capacities were measured to be 612.8 and 647.1 mA h g−1, respectively, with better rate performance. Moreover, Li et al.210 introduced ∼5 nm thick carbon-coated Sb2S3 rod on graphene. In propylene carbonate/fluoroethylene carbonate electrolyte, Sb2S3/graphene showed the maximum capacity of 710 mA h g−1 with 40% capacity retention. However, N-propyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide IL electrolyte delivered a high reversible capacity of 760 mA h g−1 and retained 95% of its initial performance after 100 cycles.
4.4. Iron-based sulfide composite
As anode material for SIBs, FeS2 with graphene composite is a potential candidate owing to its high theoretical specific capacity (∼894 mA h g−1), abundant availability, low price, and nontoxic nature.211,212 The Na+ storage mechanism of FeS2-based materials has revealed a two-step reaction as shown below. FeS2 + 2Na+ + 2e− ↔ Na2FeS2(xxiv) Na2FeS2 + 2Na+ + 2e− ↔ 2Na2S + Fe(xxv)
Chen et al.213 prepared a conductive and flexible aerogel with FeS2 microspheres on lower thick RGO (∼3.44 nm) (FeS2/RGO-A) at room temperature. The surface of FeS2 microspheres was first modified by (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane and then immobilized on negatively charged RGO-A, as shown in Fig. 11c, which has a high surface area (160.8 m2 g−1). Consequently, the as-synthesized FeS2/RGO-A delivered a capacity of 370 mA h g−1 at the rate of 0.1C, which was significantly higher than that of pure FeS2, and the superiority was continued by FeS2/RGO-A at any constant rate. Moreover, it displayed significantly stable cyclic performance by low decay rate of 0.051% per cycle over 800 cycles at 1C with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency. Bu et al.214 introduced a 3D graphene (3DG) encapsulated FeS@carbon core–shell nanostructure as anodes for SIBs where the FeS was prepared in a Prussian blue form (Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3) by a one-step calcination in the presence of sulfur powder (1:3) at 800 °C for 2 h. The as-prepared 3DG/FeS@C has a carbon shell along with sulfur doping throughout the sample, which produced initial discharge and charge specific capacities of 844.4 and 507.7 mA h g−1, respectively, with 60.1% coulombic efficiency at the first cycle. However, an increase to 97% coulombic efficiency was achieved at the second cycle, and it stayed constant after 80 cycles, which was markedly higher than that of pure FeS (27.6 mA h g−1 after 60 cycles). Thus, FeS/graphene produced a superior result than other MSs.215 Consequently, Zhao et al.216 prepared hybrid FeS2/FeS binary NP-based graphene nanocomposite for SIBs that showed an initial discharge and charge specific capacities of 742 and 552 mA h g−1, respectively, resulting in a coulombic efficiency of 74.4%, which was better than that of bare FeS2/FeS electrode (discharge and charge capacities of 586 and 407 mA h g−1, respectively, with 69.4% coulombic efficiency). Generally, the initial capacity loss is due to electrolyte decomposition, irreversible phase conversion reaction, and the formation of SEI layer. In particular, it showed very stable rate performance as it achieved reversible capacity of 251 mA h g−1 under 20 A g−1. Beyond the above-mentioned iron sulfides with graphene composite, many other iron sulfides were introduced for better electrochemical Na+ storage, such as Fe7S8 NPs-NGNs,217 Fe1−xS@PCNWs/RGO.218 and (FeSb2S4/EN-RGO).219
4.5. Cobalt-based sulfide composite
Cobalt sulfides have received considerable attention in recent years for potential application in electrochemical Na+ storage that involves a conversion reaction mechanism with high theoretical capacity220 and stability.221 For example, the flaky CoS2 and graphene (CoS2@RGO) nanocomposite produced a reversible capacity of 192 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles. The CoS@RGO composite also delivered an impressive high specific capacity of 540 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 (eqn (xxvi)) with excellent cycle stability (420 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles).222 Similarly, the CoS@RGO nanoflowers223 delivered a high reversible capacity of 620 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 with superior rate capability by delivering discharge capacity of 329 mA h g−1 at 4 A g−1. Recently, certain other mixed MSs such as CoS2/NiS2–RGO and CoNi2S4/RGO composites were reported for anode application for SIBs.219,224 CoS + 2Na+ + 2e → Co + Na2S(xxvi)
A NiCo2S4 alloyed hollow prism with a size of 500–600 nm on RGO (RGO–NiCo2S4) was prepared by Zhang et al.226 The transmission electron microscopy image shows a hollow and porous structure that allows the insertion of bigger ions such as Na+ (Fig. 11d). The highly crystalline RGO–NiCo2S4 showed good discharge capacity of 496.4 mA h g−1 at the fifth cycle, with only 1.8% capacity loss, which can be shown by the following equations. NiCo2S4 + 8Na+ + 8e− → 4Na2S + Ni + 2Co(xxvii) Na2S + Ni ↔ NixS + 2Na+ + 2e−(xxviii) Na2S + Co ↔ CoxS + 2Na+ + 2e−(xxix)
Similarly, NiSx hollow nanospheres/RGO (NiSx/RGO) were prepared by Kang et al.227 The Ni nanospheres were transformed into NiSx hollow nanospheres by the nanoscale Kirkendall diffusion effect through sulfidation treatment at 300 °C under H2S (Fig. 11e). As expected, the hollow NiSx/RGO showed better initial discharge capacity (626 mA h g−1) than dense NiSx/RGO (584 mA h g−1) at a current density of 0.3 A g−1, whereas their capacity retentions were 100% and 87%, respectively, calculated from the 10th to the 150th cycle.
4.6. Alloyed metal sulfide composites
There are three categories of anode materials in SIBs: insertion materials, conversion materials and alloying materials.12 Among them, the alloyed metal sulfides have received lots of attentions as promising sodium storage materials thanks to their high theoretical capacity228 which probably due to both conversion reaction and alloy-dealloying reaction.229 For example, Gong et al.230 have prepared the CuCo2S4/rGO by a simple one-step solvothermal method which showed a good reversible specific capacity of 433 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1. Further, Zhu et al.231 have prepared SnS/SnSb NPs via vulcanization that showed a large discharge capacity of 1028 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, which was much higher than that of discharge capacity from SnS2 (∼680 at 20).187 Result indicating that the created defects in the structure which is useful for Na+ ion transport and better phase transformation of SnS, which has higher reversibility than its counterpart oxide.
4.7. Heteroatoms-doped graphene–metal sulfide composites
It is already proven that the heteroatoms-doped graphene is more conductive and suitable for the preparation of anode composite for SIBs.226 So far, both theoretical and experimental results have shown that doping with N, S, P or B atoms into graphene structure could further enhance its electrochemical behavior and electron transport capability. Thus, the outstanding battery performance can be ascribed from doped graphene–metal sulfide composites due to the presence of highly conductive and heteroatoms-doped graphene, which buffered against the high-volume changes of metal sulfide caused during charge/discharge and enhanced the Na+ diffusion rate.206 For example, He et al.217 have prepared Fe7S8 NPs anchored on nitrogen-doped graphene through a combined strategy of solvothermal and postheating process. The as-prepared composite exhibits a high discharge capacity of 393.1 mA h g−1 over 500 cycles at a current density of 400 mA g−1 with good rate performance of 543 mA h g−1 even at 10 A g−1. This result originated from the N-doped graphene that building up a robust structure to endure the repeated Na+ insertion/extraction through the reversible conversion process of Fe7S8 into Fe and Na2S. Moreover, the 1st and 2nd discharge capacity is very close which may due to the doping of graphene, while graphene consisted electrode generally exhibits comparatively large 1st discharge capacity due to the defects on graphene sheets.173,179 Similarly, Xiong et al.205 have prepared Sb2S3 NPs on sulfur-doped graphene sheets (Sb2S3/SGS) that enables a very stable capacity retention of 83% for 900 cycles with high capacities and excellent rate performances. Further, it showed very stable reversible conversion process of Sb2S3 to 2Sb and 3Na2S on SGS. This is also due to the SGS that played a critical role for enhancing long-term cyclability and rate capability of Sb2S3/SGS composites resulting from flexible volume expansion during sodiation/desodiation process. Therefore, it is advantageous to use heteroatoms-doped graphene into anode materials for SIBs.
5. Graphene/organic materials composites
The well-chosen organic molecules (such as small molecules, macro molecules, polymers) interacting with graphene through non-covalent232,233 (π–π interaction or hydrogen bonding) or covalent234 process which forming graphene–organic architectures with tunable physical and chemical properties. Typically, organic molecules possess an extended π-conjugated scaffold that can be decorated with functional groups.235 The chemical bonds between graphene and organic compounds play a central role to prevent the dissolving of electrode materials. Due to easy preparation, flexible shape, tunable electronic bandgap and conductivity, graphene–organic architectures are widely used in various research fields.
Most of the SIBs are usually inorganic and their recycling methods are limited; consequently, they require more power consumption. The toxic property along with increased power consumption caused significant environmental problems.236 Based on this, the usage of organic materials is increasing significantly, and they are composed of naturally available elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur). Moreover, these materials have several advantages over inorganic materials, such as high theoretical gravimetric capacities owing to lesser atomic weight, lesser environmental impact; they can be easily reaped using low-temperature biomass resources without metals, and the structural flexibility of molecules results in easy accommodation of huge Na+ ions reversibly without any aids; further, they are lightweight, flexible, environmental friendly, metal free, and have less cost.237 Furthermore, the simple functionalization of organic molecules and its structural diversity helps to directly control the redox properties of a battery and consequently improve the battery performance.
Several organic materials, namely, carbonyl compounds, conductive polymers, conjugated microporous polymers, nitroxyl radical polymers, organometallic polymers, Schiff bases, pteridine derivatives, and organic salts were studied as anode materials for SIBs.238,239 The usage of organic materials also has certain challenges despite the various advantages. They have a low mass density, electronic conductivity, and solubility of the active materials in the electrolyte, as well as poor cyclic stability. The inclusion of nanostructures and composition with carbon materials can satisfy the requirements of a good battery with large capacity, high power density and energy, long cycle life, and reduced solubility.240,241
The inclusion of graphene-based materials such as GO, RGO, and heteroatoms-doped graphene have introduced the use of organic-based composite materials as anodes to increase the electronic conductivity in addition to decreasing the solubility of the organic compounds.242 The graphene material has better qualities over other types of carbon-based materials, such as carbon NFs and CNTs.243,244 In improving the electronic conductivity, it is important to ensure a uniform mixing of compounds of graphene and organic materials. The strong π–π interactions between graphene and conjugated organic molecules performs a key role in simultaneously reducing the dissolution issue and enhancing the battery life. For achieving uniform mixing of composites, perfect drying is essential after the mixing of the composites, especially in small sodium salt molecule levels.237,245 The electrochemical properties of graphene/organic materials composites anode materials for SIBs are summarized in Table 3.

To satisfy the higher demand of organic material-based anodes for SIBs with satisfactory electrochemical performances and high rate capability, Wang et al.246 synthesized organic sodium terephthalate (Na2TP)–graphene (22 wt%) composite (Na2TP@GE) using a simple freeze-drying method (Fig. 12a). Instrumental characterization revealed that the composition was well synthesized with smaller particles. They observed that the prepared Na2TP@GE composite has better reversibility capacity of 268.9 mA h g−1 at the second cycle along with improved cyclability and capacity retention (77.3%) after 500 cycles, as can be observed from Fig. 12b and based on the equation, Na2C8H4O4 + 2Na+ + 2e− ↔ Na4C8H4O4. A better result was obtained by Cao et al.247 when they used antisolvent precipitation method and only 5 wt% GO to Na2TP (Fig. 12c); subsequently, the authors achieved a reversible capability of 354 mA h g−1 at the first cycle and maintained 235 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current rate of 0.1C with excellent rate capability. This result was due to better conductivity and porosity resulting from the wrapping by GO through π–π stacking, which leads to better structural stability and Na+ ion insertion, respectively. Moreover, Deng et al.248 also used graphene as a conductivity enhancer in the graphene-wrapped sodium benzene-dicarboxylate (Na2NC/G). They also observed that the presence of graphene increased the electrochemical kinetics of the anode owing to the increased electronic conductivity and active reaction area. Moreover, the novel organic nanocomposite has more than 220 mA h g−1 reversible capacity at 10C with 92% of capacity retention. Importantly, they investigated the redox mechanism of this organic anode by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Fig. 12d). As the Na2NC/G was fully discharged by 0.1 V, the typical vibration peaks at 1560 and 1412 cm−1 of –COO− became weak and shifted to lower wave numbers. The tiny shoulder peaks (1605, 1495, and 1395 cm−1) attributed to the vibrations of the CC bond of naphthalene rings completely disappeared, indicating the reduction of CO bonds with rearrangement of CC. At the full charge, all peaks recovered their intensities and positions, which suggests the structural reversibility of Na2NC. Based on this analysis, the redox reaction of Na2NC can be regarded as reversible Na+-insertion/extraction reactions, as shown in Fig. 12e.

Zhao et al.249 analyzed the anode material performance of redox-active polyimide (PI) materials assisted with graphene as an electrochemical performance enhancer. From their experiments, it was identified that the inclusion of graphene improved the storage capacity significantly from 50 mA h g−1 to 225 mA h g−1. Their study concluded that the use of PI–graphene as a negative electrode and PI–RGO as a positive electrode has achieved significantly high energy density of 21.5 W h kg−1 at 3400 W kg−1 power density. Luo et al.250 analyzed GO-assisted croconic acid disodium salt (CADS) nanocomposite as an anode for SIBs (Fig. 13a). It was observed that the capacity of pure CADS after 60 cycles decreased drastically from 250 mA h g−1 to 50 mA h g−1 owing to the large stress/strain of CADS during repeating phase changes. However, it was determined that the above problem can be diminished by introducing GO-wrapping into CADS, which allows structural changes and increases the durability with higher capacity.

Gu et al.251 examined the performance of carbonates/bicarbonates combined with RGO as anode materials for SIBs. Different base materials such as FeCO3, CoCO3, and Ni(HCO3)2) were used in this study. When compared to all the composites, FeCO3 + RGO showed excellent characteristics with a capacity of 247 mA h g−1 and was able to retain a capacity of up to 87% after 500 cycles. Wang et al.252 demonstrated the electronic performance of redox-active renewable-juglone assisted with RGO-based nanocomposite as an anode material for SIBs. This material was produced based on the method of facile and scalable self-assembly without adding any additives. Copper foils were directly immersed in the juglone/RGO mixed solution. Then, with a subsequent reduction using hydrazine vapor, an integrated, black, and rough film was grown directly on a copper substrate (Fig. 13b). The coulombic efficiency and capacity retention values of pure juglone, RGO, and juglone/RGO (Fig. 13c) as a function of cycle number are shown. It is observed that the initial charges of pure juglone and juglone/RGO drop marginally and is then stabilize at 110 mA h g−1 and 305 mA h g−1, respectively, after 10 cycles. A high reversible capacity of 280 mA h g−1 with almost 99% coulombic efficiency is observed after 100 cycles; moreover, the SIB can simultaneously retain 70% of its initial capacity after 300 cycles. The solid π–π interface between the aromatic structure and the carbon framework and synergetic effect of juglone and RGO could be the reasons for enhancements in the capacity, rate capability, and cyclability of the tested new electrode. The Na+ ion insertion/extraction was evaluated by X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES). The oxygen K-edge XANES spectra of the as-prepared electrodes (Fig. 13d) exhibit a sharp spectral peak at 532 eV, which can be attributed to the CO groups and a broad absorption in the range of 536–550 eV, which corresponds to C–O or CO groups. However, after full discharge, a sharp peak newly appeared at 534 eV, with the diminution of peak at 532 eV, which might be the indication of C–O–Na formation due to Na+ ion insertion. The reduction of the peak at 534 eV with restoration of the peak at 532 eV of charged electrode indicates the redox reaction of juglone with Na+ ions. Therefore, theoretically, a single juglone molecule can bind with two sodium atoms (Fig. 13e).
Chen et al.253 prepared an anode material comprising polystyrene–polyaniline/RGO hybrid composite for SIB application. The initial charge and discharge capacities of the hybrid composite is measured to be 336 and 852 mA h g−1, respectively, and these values decreased drastically up to 40 cycles and stabilized after 40 cycles. The Coulombic efficiency was more than 90% after 10 cycles and it was able to retain 74% of initial capacity after 5000 cycles. The authors concluded that the selected hybrid composite had higher discharging capacity and better stability than hard carbons.
Han et al.254 prepared disodium terephthalate (DST)/RGO nanocomposite as an anode material for SIB application using ultrasonic-aided coprecipitation. They observed that the augmentation in storage capacity is influenced by composites preparation through mechanical mixing (M-DST/RGO) and simple evaporation (E-DST/RGO). The DST/RGO composite achieved a high reversible capacity of 422 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, while the capacities were measured to be 303 and 368 mA h g−1 for M-DST/RGO and E-DST/RGO, respectively. However, the revisable capacity decreased more significantly in DST/RGO than in M-DST/RGO owing to the high diffusivity rate of Na+.
It is inferred from the above discussion that the use of graphene-based organic nanocomposite could deliver better anode characteristics than pure organic materials owing to the enhanced charging/discharging capacity and better retention of initial capacity. However, these types of strategies only reduce the solubility; they do not completely diminish the solubility problem. For avoiding complete solubility, a solid-state electrolyte could be a better option; moreover, it also has significantly low electronic conductivity and larger interface resistance at the solid-to-liquid transition. No study has so far reported the performance of organic/graphene composites with solid-state electrolytes in SIBs.
6. Graphene/metal phosphides composite anode
Zheng et al.255 designed Ni5P4 nanospheres covered with RGO nanostructures (Ni5P4@RGO) prepared by hydrothermal synthesis and phosphidation for use in SIBs as an anode material (Fig. 14a). It was observed that after 200 cycles, the Ni5P4@RGO delivered a specific capacity of 304 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 because of the stronger coupling between Ni5P4 and graphene layers that resulted in better electrochemical performance, which is presented by the following equations. Ni5P4 + 12Na+ + 12e− → 5Ni + 4Na3P (at first discharge)(xxx) P + 3Na+ + 3e− ↔ Na3P(xxxi)

KGaA). 
Nitrogen and phosphorus-codoped carbon comprising a core–shell structure of Ni2P (Ni2P@N, P–C) NPs were loaded onto RGO to form a new composite Ni2P@N, P–C/RGO (Fig. 14b), which was employed as an anode material by Li et al.256 It was prepared by the hydrothermal process followed by the phosphorization process. After 3000 cycles, the specific capacity was measured to be 110 mA h g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1, which indicates the superior stability of the structure (Fig. 14c) due to the advantage of core–shell structure and effective attachment with RGO. Zhao et al.257 prepared Ni2P/with RGO and CNTs and formed an intertwining anode material for SIBs. A capacity of 224 mA h g−1 was observed at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 after 100 cycles, satisfying the following equation, Ni2P + 3Na+ + 3e− ↔ Na3P + 2Ni. Moreover, with the increase in the number of cycles to 500, the anode materials maintained a reversible capacity of 91 mA h g−1 at current density 1 A g−1 with the advantage of a higher conductive network and mechanical strength.
Li et al.258 prepared ultrafine CoP/RGO materials by chemical precipitation and phosphorization. The cycle performance and the rate capability of the CoP/RGO electrode were measured, and the anode material was determined to possess a larger capacity of 490 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles with a current density of 100 mA g−1. The storage performance was improved owing to higher electrical conductivity, surface area, and interlinked porous structures. Zhao et al.259 prepared CoP material that generates a metal–organic framework on RGO through an in situ phosphorization process. The charging specific capacity was observed to be 748 mA h g−1 when CoP@NC/RGO was used as the anode material. It also possesses a higher reversible capacity of 550 mA h g−1 over 300 cycles owing to the rapid electron pathways. Furthermore, the CoP nanocrystals covered by carbon acts as a dual layer and prevent corrosion.
Ge et al.260 used CoP@C attached with RGO–nickel foam as the anode and achieved higher performance in SIBs. A half-cell configuration method was employed for evaluating the storage performance of the anode material. After 100 cycles, the unique anode materials were observed to possess a high specific capacity and current density of 473.1 mA h g−1 and 100 mA g−1, respectively, due to the linking between CoP@C polyhedrons and RGO networks. The charge transfer kinetics were enhanced by RGO networks by providing an adequate surface area. Jin et al.261 designed Co2P with unique nitrogen-doped carbon matrices by employing ZIF-67 as the predecessor and shielding with RGO nanostructures (Co2P@ N–C@RGO) for SIBs. This anode material exhibited a greater reversible capacity of 225 mA h g−1 (at 50 mA g−1) and 100 mA h g−1 (at 1 A g−1) after 100 and 1000 cycles, respectively. Moreover, excellent structural stability was provided by Co2P@ N–C@RGO, and the presence of RGO enhanced the electrical conductivity and reduced the volume change during storage.
Li et al.262 evaluated SIB performance by using FeP@CoP interlinked with RGO NSs (RGO@CoP@FeP) as an anode. These were prepared by low-temperature phosphorization using a reactant of the Prussian blue family. A specific capacity of 480.2 mA h g−1 was obtained at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. The charge kinetics were obtained by wrapping the core FeP with the carbon layer and RGO NSs. Using the FeP as the core and CoP as the shell reduces the Na+ diffusion path and provides larger space for volume changes. Jiang et al.263 synthesized FeP anchored on RGO nanostructure (FeP@RGO) by chemical deposition method followed by the phosphorization process. For 250 cycles, a specific capacity of 388.8 mA h g−1 was obtained at a current density of 100 mA g−1 and the cycling behavior and rate performance of FeP@RGO anode at various current densities were measured. The porous structure is beneficial for shortening the diffusion distance of Na+ during the discharging and charging processes in the ionic diffusion from electrolytes to electrodes. Wang et al.264 prepared a hybrid anode material to increase the cycling ability. The hybrid material of iron phosphide was bound on 3D phosphorus-doped graphitic nitrogen-rich graphene obtained from the phosphidation of RGO decorated with Fe2O3. A reversible capacity and rate capability of 613 and 422 mA h g−1, respectively, were obtained at current densities of 50 mA g−1 and 1 A g−1. These anode materials provide excellent structural stability by inducing electron transfer.
Wang et al.265 designed FeP@C/RGO nanocomposite for achieving better performance in SIBs. The FeP@C/rGO anode material possesses a specific capacity of 635.7 mA h g−1 at a current density of 20 mA g−1. After 1000 cycles, only 11.8% capacity was reduced, which showed better stability. The better performance of this anode material was shown by a low volume expansion of 55% and a high capacitive contribution of 93.9%. Li et al.266 synthesized mesoporous FeP/RGO nanostructure as anode materials for SIBs by precipitation and phosphorization processes. The specific capacity and current density were obtained as 547 mA h g−1 and 100 mA g−1, respectively, after 100 cycles. For 1000 cycles, a capacity of approximately 311 mA h g−1 was observed at the current density of 1 A g−1. The FeP and RGO significantly enhance the electrical performance. Fu et al.267 developed an electrostatic spray deposition approach for fabricating transition MPs that provide an efficient electron–ion network. The structural stability of the materials is maintained by inducing electron transfer kinetics. 3D porous Cu3P/RGO composites were employed as an anode material for sodium-ion storage. The cycle performance of the 3D porous Cu3P/RGO nanocomposite at current densities of 100 and 1000 mA g−1 was determined. The electrode showed a discharge capacity of 131 mA h g−1 (at 100 mA g−1) and 116 mA h g−1 (at 1000 mA g−1) after 1000 cycles and 2500 cycles, respectively. Moreover, the Cu3P dispersed in the carbon matrix provides greater reaction activity and outstanding structural stability, which led to a better lifespan.
Yin et al.268 prepared MoP hollow nanospheres enclosed with 3D RGO networks (MoP@RGO). After 600 cycles, the anode material showed a specific capacity of 353.8 8 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Furthermore, after 3000 cycles, it showed an improved capacity of 183.4 mA h g−1 even at a high current density of 10 A g−1 owing to the hollow structure and flexibility of RGO. Li et al.269 prepared Sn4P3/RGO hybrids as anode materials for SIBs through in situ low-temperature phosphorization. These nanostructures were formed with excellent thermal conductivity of Sn and a larger capacity of P with RGO NSs. For 100 cycles, these anode materials possessed a reversible capacity and current density of 656 mA h g−1 and 100 mA g−1, respectively. Furthermore, this composite possesses greater stability after 1500 cycles with a capacity of 362 mA h g−1. The electrochemical properties of graphene/metal phosphides composites anode materials for SIBs are summarized in Table 4.

7. Conclusions and future perspectives
SIBs have received significant attention as energy storage mediums owing to the widespread availability and lower cost of sodium over lithium. Various carbon-based materials with different structures and textures have been studied as a potential anode material for SIBs; among the carbonaceous material, graphene has received considerable attention owing to its excellent physical and chemical properties. However, the electrochemical performance of SIBs using graphene as an anode material is adversely affected owing to the lower specific capacity. Further, during the fabrication of electrodes, the tendency of the material to stack together leads to poor Na+ accessibility. However, the production of 3D porous graphene structures along with introduction of defects and heteroatoms can effectively eliminate the above-mentioned limitations. The conversion of 2D graphene structure into 3D hierarchical porous structure can considerably augment the electrical conductivity. The porous structure can provide multidirectional ion diffusion pathway, reducing the electron/ion transfer resistance and consequently enhancing the rate performance. The porous structure can also increase the mechanical strength to buffer the expansion in volume during the charging cycle. The introduction of defects and heteroatoms on the graphene NS can further improve the sodium-storage capacity owing to the increased active sites for electron/ion transfer along with the modified electronic and physical–chemical properties. In addition, the co-doping method can provide even better sodium-storage capacity owing to synergetic effects. Nevertheless, graphene with lower packing density may cause a lower energy density.
Recently, conversion-type and alloying-type anode materials are proposed for the SIBs. Their low cost exhibits significant potential for mass scale production of ESSs. However, the utilization of transition metal composite for SIBs exhibited unsatisfactory outcomes for practical requirements. The poor rate capacity and coulombic efficiency are attributed to the poor electron conductivity and sluggish ion kinetics. Therefore, the development of composite anode with graphene as the conducting material along with other materials is considered to be a significantly effective method to augment the overall performance. In general, graphene in this composite can act as solid-lubricant for dispersing of NPs in the composite materials and work as a highly conductive matrix confirming a good electrical contact. In addition, this conductive graphene matrix can inhibit the volume expansion/contraction and aggregation of nanoparticles in the composite materials during the charge and discharge process. In recent years, there has been remarkable advancements in graphene and its derivatives as anode materials for SIBs; however, certain areas must be investigated further for creating it as the most suitable option for SIBs. Thus, further research work is required to develop new and controllable synthesis of different graphene structures with optimum performance.
