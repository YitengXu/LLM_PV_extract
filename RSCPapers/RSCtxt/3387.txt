The remarkable photocurrent density (∼4 mA cm−2 at a potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl) and high solar to hydrogen efficiency of the materials obtained were ascribed to the novel branched nanostructure and efficient electron transfer from CdS to TiO2.
Hydrogen is an extremely valuable chemical commodity due to its cleanliness and high energy density. The sun is, in fact, the ultimate renewable energy resource, which will occupy a pivotal position in the future. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) splitting of water is one of the most altruistic technologies for clean and renewable hydrogen production. Since it first was reported as a PEC electrode material for water splitting,1 TiO2 has been extensively investigated as a photoanode for PEC water splitting because of its favorable band-edge position, strong optical absorption, excellent chemical stability, photocorrosion resistance, and low cost. However, TiO2-based photoanodes suffer from two major problems: (1) no absorption of light in the visible region due to a large band gap (e.g., ∼3.2 eV for anatase; ∼3.0 eV for rutile) and (2) fast recombination of excitons due to the short diffusion paths of charge carriers. Various strategies have been explored to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2, for example, doping with metal (Fe, Sn, etc.)2,3 or nonmetal (C, N, etc.)4,5 elements to induce red shift of band gap absorption, sensitizing with noble metals (e.g., Ag and Au NPs) to absorb visible light due to their extraordinary localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) properties.6–8 The modification of electronic and structural properties of TiO2 with other small band gap semiconductors, e.g., quantum dots (QDs) such as CdS,9,10 CdSe,11 CdTe,12 PbSe,13 and InP,14 is also widely used to enhance the efficiency of solar energy conversion.
Design and synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) metal oxide nanostructures such as nanorods, nanowires and nanotubes have recently attracted great attention due to their versatile applications.15,16 Aligned 1D nanostructure arrays are potential blocks for PEC water splitting due to their unique advantages.17–19 Compared to TiO2 films comprised of nanoparticles, highly ordered TiO2 nanorod arrays (TiO2 NRs) offer direct electrical pathways for photogenerated electrons,20 leading to high electron transport rates, which in turn suppresses the recombination of electron–hole pairs. Consequently, three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured photoanodes have recently received significant attention due to their unique characteristics such as large surface area, efficient charge separation and high carrier mobility, which are beneficial to PEC water splitting.21 Additionally, single crystalline branched TiO2 nanorod arrays (TiO2 B-NRs) can result in increased surface area and enhanced electron conductivity for improved photocurrent harvest efficiencies. Zheng and coworkers22 have recently reported on the synthesis of branched TiO2 nanorods and evaluation of their photoelectrochemical properties of water splitting, and have shown that the incident photon to current conversion efficiency increased to 67% at 380 nm, nearly two times higher than that of the bare TiO2 NRs. Guo et al.23 synthesized dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) on TiO2 B-NRs with a light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 3.75%. Yang et al.24 synthesized CdS QDs coated on TiO2 NRs showing a photocurrent of 2.5 mA cm−2 and a conversion efficiency of 1.91%. Zhou and co-workers25 synthesized CdS QDs sensitized TiO2 hyperbranched nanorod microspheres used in DSSCs with a short current of 2.53 mA cm−2 and a conversion efficiency of 0.71%. However, no work has been reported on the use of CdS QDs sensitized TiO2 B-NRs as photoanodes for PEC water splitting.
A good candidate for electrode materials of PEC systems possesses characteristics such as a high charge transport rate, low recombination probability of electron–hole pairs, and a wide photoabsorption range. Specifically, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency can be improved using ordered TiO2 B-NRs sensitized by CdS QDs as photoanodes in PEC water splitting (Scheme 1). Branched nanostructures of semiconductor oxides could have better charge transport and light absorption than nanoparticle films and larger surface areas compared to bare NRs. With a small band gap (∼2.4 eV) CdS can absorb more visible light. Additionally, CdS QDs have major advantages when used in PEC water splitting because of the generation of multiple excitons from the absorption of a single photon.10 Additionally, CdS QDs deposited on the surface of TiO2 branches have the capability to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency by promoting the electron transfer.26 It has also been shown that efficient charge transfer from CdS QDs to TiO2 can reduce the photocorrosion of CdS to a greater extent, which would further improve the stability of PEC electrodes.26–28

This paper describes the synthesis of CdS quantum dots sensitized TiO2 B-NRs (CdS/TiO2 B-NRs) by a three-step solution-based approach, which consists of the growth of TiO2 NRs on a FTO substrate by a hydrothermal method,29 the formation of TiO2 B-NRs by an aqueous chemical growth method followed by a sequential chemical bath deposition (S-CBD) method30 to obtain CdS QDs sensitized TiO2 B-NRs. Fig. 1a and b shows typical field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of TiO2 NRs grown directly on the FTO substrate. The NRs containing many step edges were tetragonal in shape with an average diameter of 150–200 nm and the surface density was about 2 × 107 NRs per cm2. Fig. 1b indicates that TiO2 NRs are smooth and have grown perpendicular to the FTO substrate, and the length is about 2.4 μm. Upon the treatment of TiO2 NRs with a TiCl4 solution via an aqueous chemical growth method, TiO2 B-NRs were obtained as shown in Fig. 1c and d. The TiO2 NRs were decorated with numerous secondary nanostructures uniformly and displayed a branched feature. The whole TiO2 NRs were enclosed by TiO2 nanobranched structures with a diameter of 10–20 nm, which greatly improves the specific surface area of TiO2 NRs. In order to assess the S-CBD process, we followed the deposition of CdS QDs on TiO2 B-NRs by monitoring the SEM images (Fig. S1, ESI†) and UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. S2, ESI†) at different cycles of S-CBD. Fig. 1e and f show the morphology of the TiO2 B-NRs after being sensitized with CdS QDs for nine S-CBD cycles. It indicates that the CdS QDs were coated over the branches uniformly, which is crucial to obtaining good PEC properties. Further sensitization with CdS QDs could result in the aggregation of particles at the surface of the TiO2 B-NRs films (Fig. S1, ESI†). As will be discussed later, sensitization for nine cycles was optimized with a photocurrent density of 3.98 mA cm−2 at a potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl.

The TiO2 B-NRs and CdS/TiO2 B-NRs were further characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) (Fig. 2). TiO2 NRs are single-crystalline tetragonal-rutile TiO2, in agreement with results reported previously.29 As shown in Fig. 2a, a three-dimensional nanostructure with branches was grown along the backbone of the TiO2 NRs. The diameter and length of the TiO2 branches were 10–20 nm and 80 nm, respectively. Fig. 2b shows the corresponding HRTEM image of the TiO2 branches, which indicates good crystallinity of the materials. The observed lattice spacing of 0.32 nm corresponds to the (110) crystal plane of the tetragonal-rutile phase. Fig. 2c shows a TEM image of CdS/TiO2 B-NRs, indicating the uniform deposition of CdS QDs on the TiO2 branches. The size of the CdS QDs was about 5–10 nm. The observed lattice fringes of 0.336 and 0.29 nm in the HRTEM image (Fig. 2d) correspond to the (111) and (200) planes of CdS (JCPDS 80-0019). These results confirm that the CdS QDs have been successfully assembled on the TiO2 B-NRs.

Phase structure and composition of our materials were determined from XRD patterns. Fig. 3a indicates that FTO substrates have the tetragonal rutile phase of SnO2 (JCPDS 41-1445). All the peaks can be attributed to the tetragonal TiO2 with the rutile phase (JCPDS 21-1276). The enhanced (002) diffraction peak in the curve indicates that the NRs are grown perpendicular to the FTO substrate and are well crystallized. Moreover, diffraction peaks of (110), (111) and (211) are also absent, indicating that the as-deposited film is oriented with respect to the substrates. Fig. 3b displays the XRD pattern of the TiO2 B-NRs; compared to that of TiO2 NRs, the (002) diffraction peak is strengthened, which may have been caused by the post-annealing process upon the synthesis of the TiO2 B-NRs. Additionally, no diffraction peaks of anatase TiO2 were found (Fig. 3b) indicating that the TiO2 B-NRs are single phase rutile. We also note from Fig. 3b that no CdS peaks were observed probably because the CdS QDs were mostly dispersed on the surface of TiO2 branches. The mass fraction of the loaded CdS QDs is still low, although the surface coverage is high. In order to determine the existence of CdS QDs and their ratio in CdS/TiO2 B-NRs, SEM elemental mapping of Ti, O, Cd, S and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were employed (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†). Cd and S elements are present uniformly in the material and the atomic ratio of Ti, O, Cd and S is 32.05:65.59:1.17:1.20. This result further confirms successful coating of CdS QDs on the TiO2 B-NRs.

The light absorption range of TiO2 NRs, TiO2 B-NRs and CdS/TiO2 B-NRs was determined by UV-Vis spectra (Fig. 4). The spectra of TiO2 NRs and TiO2 B-NRs show that they absorb mainly in the UV range with a wavelength below 410 nm due to their large band gap (rutile TiO2 ∼3.0 eV). Compared with TiO2 NRs, TiO2 B-NRs can absorb more light due to the presence of branched TiO2 and light reflected between the TiO2 branches attached on the NRs.31 Upon sensitization with CdS QDs for 9 cycles, the absorption range of the material can be extended to 550 nm, indicating the effective photoabsorption properties in the visible region. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows that with the increased S-CBD cycles, the CdS/TiO2 B-NRs can absorb more visible light. With the increased number of sensitization cycles, the surface of TiO2 could be completely covered with a continuous layer of CdS, which has poor stability as a result of photocorrosion. Additionally, the aggregation of CdS will lead to the recombination of the photogenerated electron–holes, thus affecting the photoelectrochemical properties.

Fig. 5 displays a set of linear-sweep voltammograms for TiO2 NRs, TiO2 B-NRs, and CdS/TiO2 B-NRs with different S-CBD cycles, which presents the effect of CdS QDs sensitized TiO2 B-NRs on the PEC performance of TiO2 B-NRs. The dark current from −1.2 V to 0 V of each sample was almost zero. The photocurrent of TiO2 NRs is 0.13 mA cm−2, which is smaller than the result reported by Yang and co-workers.19 The photoelectrochemical properties of NRs could be affected by several factors such as the differences in lengths and diameters of the NRs, the surface areas, and the degree of aggregation at the base of the NRs. Notably, the photocurrent of TiO2 NRs can also differ widely depending on the synthetic methodologies.14,18,22 For the TiO2 B-NRs, the photocurrent intensity is 1.16 mA cm−2 at a potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl. The branched nanostructure has a stronger light absorbance and more efficient charge separation and collection than the NRs, which is also good evidence.32
 Fig. 5  
I–V curves for different sensitization cycles of CdS/TiO2 B-NRs. 
As the amount of CdS increased upon increasing the S-CBD sensitization cycles to nine, the photocurrent increased drastically to a maximum of 3.98 mA cm−2 at a potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl (the standard deviation is ±0.1 mA cm−2) under the AM 1.5G simulated sunlight illumination, which is about four times larger than the pristine TiO2 B-NRs. The photocurrent of CdS/TiO2 B-NRs is significantly higher compared to CdS QDs sensitized TiO2 NRs as reported previously.24,33,34 However, when the sensitization cycles were more than 9, the photocurrent of the samples decreased gradually (e.g., 1.75 mA cm−2 at a potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl upon the sensitization for 13 cycles). This phenomenon can be explained by the morphology of the samples. First, the photocurrent increases with increasing CdS sensitizing S-CBD cycles as more CdS QDs are nucleated to absorb more visible light. Additionally, the direct contact (or close proximity) between CdS QDs and TiO2 (e.g., a full monolayer of CdS on the TiO2 surface) is essential to obtain the high-efficiency charge separation.35 The electrons generated in CdS under illumination of visible light can rapidly transfer to TiO2 branches, then to the trunk of TiO2 NRs attached on FTO substrates, and finally to the cathode to generate hydrogen. Second, when sensitized for more than 9 cycles, the aggregates of CdS QDs can be found coated at the surface of B-TiO2 NRs, which leads to a larger particle size of CdS. These large CdS particles have poor ability to generate multiple excitons from the absorption of a single photon, which is caused by the disappearance of the quantum effect. What is more, the aggregation of CdS crystallites will increase the chance of the recombination of photoelectrons and holes, which will result in the decrease in photoelectrochemical performance.36 A similar dependence of photocatalytic activities on the amount of photoactive compounds has also been reported by other groups.19,37,38
A low photocurrent onset and a saturation bias are extremely important to achieve a higher efficiency in PEC hydrogen generation. The solar to hydrogen (STH) efficiencies can be expressed by the following equation39 η = I(1.23 − V)/Plight(1)where I is the photocurrent density at the measurement applied bias, V is the applied bias (vs. RHE), and Plight is the incident light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G). In the 1 M KOH electrolyte, the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential can be converted from the Ag/AgCl reference electrode as: RHE = V(Ag/AgCl) + 1.0 V.3,5,40Fig. 6a shows calculated STH efficiencies of different samples versus the applied bias. The TiO2 B-NRs exhibit an optimal conversion efficiency of ∼0.49% at 0.67 V vs. RHE, and the CdS/TiO2 B-NRs (9 cycles) achieve the highest efficiency of ∼1.70% at a low bias of 0.57 V vs. RHE. CdS/TiO2 B-NRs are nearly 3.5 times larger than pristine TiO2 B-NRs.

To further quantify the PEC performance, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured as a function of incident light wavelength (Fig. 6b). Compared with photocurrent obtained under white light illumination, IPCE is a valuable tool to provide insight into the PEC photoproperties.41 The IPCE measurements were carried out on different photoanodes at 0 V vs. RHE. The IPCE was determined using the following equation28 IPCE = (1240I)/(λJlight)(2)where I is the photocurrent density, λ is the incident light wavelength, and Jlight is the measured irradiance. Moreover, IPCE is affected by three fundamental processes: charge generation (ηe−/h+), charge transport to the solid–liquid interface (ηtransport), and efficiency of interfacial charge collection (ηcollection), as illustrated in the following equation41 IPCE = ηe−/h+ηtransportηcollection(3)
As shown in Fig. 6b, compared to TiO2 NRs with a maximum IPCE value of 17.5% in the UV region, the TiO2 B-NRs showed a significantly enhanced photoactivity of 27%. Furthermore, CdS/TiO2 B-NRs exhibit the largest IPCE of 55.3% over the UV region. This can be attributed to the fact that TiO2 B-NRs can absorb more light due to small TiO2 branches, while the amount of light absorbed is significantly essential to the charge generation efficiency. The small branches (diameter 10–20 nm) have the same crystal structure as that of the backbone TiO2 NRs (rutile), which favors charge transfer and effectively suppresses the electron–hole recombination.22 Notably, IPCE results of the CdS/TiO2 B-NRs show substantial photoactivity in the visible-light region from 420 to 500 nm, which aligns exactly with the absorption of material in UV-Vis spectra. The curve of CdS/TiO2 B-NRs shows IPCEs of 17.9%, 12.3%, and 2.3% at 450 nm, 475 nm, and 500 nm, respectively. These results clearly confirm that CdS sensitization on TiO2 B-NRs improves visible light absorption, and electrons generated in CdS can be transferred to TiO2, which greatly increases the IPCE in the visible region.
In order to examine the photoresponse of the CdS/TiO2 B-NRs over time, the I–t curve of the material at +0.57 V was measured. Fig. 7a indicates that under illumination with light, a prompt photocurrent was observed owing to the transient effect of the excitation power, and the photocurrent remained in a steady state. The result further implies that the photogenerated electron in CdS QDs can be rapidly transferred from CdS QDs to TiO2 branch nanostructures, which effectively prevents the recombination of electron–hole pairs. The chemical stability of CdS/TiO2 B-NRs was measured in a three-electrode configuration. The results clearly show that the photocurrent of the material over 100 cycles was almost identical to that over the first scan cycle (Fig. 7b), indicating an excellent chemical stability. Additionally, the photocurrent of the CdS/TiO2 B-NRs was collected in a two electrode configuration under the applied potential of +0.57 V to further confirm the stability of the structure. As shown in Fig. 7c, the photocurrent of CdS/TiO2 B-NRs was steady for 10 hours (4.0 mA cm−2). This result indicates that the CdS/TiO2 B-NRs retain their original structure in PEC water splitting reactions. This could be due to the unique structure of the stabilized attachment of CdS QDs on the small TiO2 branches.

A model nanostructure of CdS/TiO2 B-NRs and the possible charge-transfer mechanism are proposed accordingly as shown in Scheme 1. The unique feature of the nanostructure allows fast and efficient transfer of the photogenerated electron from the CdS QDs to the FTO substrate. Additionally, the conduction band energy of rutile TiO2 (ECB = −0.09 V) is more positive than that of CdS (ECB = −0.52 V),42 and the charge generated in CdS can be readily injected into TiO2 branches and it transports to the FTO substrate through the single-crystalline TiO2 NRs. In this way, we can effectively suppress the recombination of electron–hole pairs to obtain the enhanced photocurrent. In other words, the value of photocurrent in the three-electrode configuration indicates the hydrogen generation efficiency from the photoelectrochemical process.
In conclusion, we have synthesized branched TiO2 nanorods sensitized with CdS QDs for the first time and tested their characteristics as photoanodes used in PEC water splitting. The photoanode materials not only enhance the light-harvesting efficiency but also suppress the photogenerated electron–hole combination through sensitizing CdS to TiO2, thus enhancing the overall water-splitting reaction. Our results yielded a high photocurrent of 3.98 mA cm−2 at a potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl, which is nearly four times larger than that of the pristine TiO2 B-NRs. The distance between the TiO2 B-NRs could be an important factor in tuning the PEC performance, which deserves further investigation. We anticipate that a judicious combination of single-crystalline TiO2 B-NRs and CdS QDs will open up new opportunities in various areas, including PEC water splitting, photocatalysis, and dye sensitized solar cells. More importantly, the CdS and TiO2 model systems studied here can be extended to other semiconductors for use as solar conversion materials.
Experimental
Preparation of TiO2 nanorod arrays
Synthesis of TiO2 NRs on FTO substrates has been described previously.29 Firstly, the FTO substrate (F:SnO2, 14 Ω square−1, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) was ultrasonically cleaned for 20 min each in deionized water, ethanol, and acetone, respectively. Briefly, 12 mL of deionized water and 12 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (mass fraction 36.5–38%) were mixed and stirred for 5 min, then 0.4 mL of titanium butoxide was added dropwise into the mixed solution. After stirring for another 5 min, 2 mL of a NaCl aqueous solution (5 M) was added to the solution and then the mixture was stirred for another 5 min. The solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL), where an FTO substrate (5 × 1 cm2) was placed at an angle against the wall of the Teflon-liner with the conducting side facing down. The hydrothermal synthesis was conducted at 150 °C for 14 h, followed by flowing of water to cool to room temperature. Afterwards, the FTO substrate was taken out, rinsed with deionized water and dried in ambient air.
Preparation of branched TiO2 nanorod arrays
TiO2 B-NRs were prepared using a simple aqueous chemical growth method. Briefly, FTO coated with the TiO2 NRs was immersed in 50 mL of a TiCl4 solution (0.2 M), which was prepared by mixing TiCl4 and ice, at 25 °C for 18 h, followed by rinsing with pure ethanol. Then the TiO2 B-NRs were dried at 80 °C and annealed in air at 450 °C for 30 min.
Preparation of CdS QDs sensitized branched TiO2 nanorod arrays
CdS QDs were deposited onto the TiO2 B-NRs through the sequential chemical bath deposition (S-CBD) method. Typically, the FTO substrate coated with TiO2 B-NRs was dipped into a 0.05 M Cd(NO3)2 aqueous solution for 5 min, then rinsed with deionized water, and then dipped into a 0.05 M Na2S aqueous solution for another 5 min followed by another rinsing with deionized water. The entire procedure was performed for one S-CBD cycle, the desired deposition of CdS QDs was achieved after several cycles.
Characterization of the catalysts
Morphology and microstructure of the sample were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Hitachi S-4800, 5 kV). Elemental analysis was performed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) at 15 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope at 200 kV. Prior to the measurements, the branched nanoarrays were detached from the FTO substrate and ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol, and deposited onto a copper grid with a lacey carbon film and dried under ambient conditions. The crystal structure of the sample was investigated using an X-ray diffractometer (D/MAX-2500) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5416 Å) at 40 kV and 140 mA. The XRD data were collected over a 2θ range of 20–80° at a scanning speed of 0.02° per step. Optical transmittance measurements of pristine TiO2 B-NRs and CdS/TiO2 B-NRs in different S-CBD cycles were performed using a Hitachi U-3010 UV-Vis spectrophotometer.
Photoelectrochemical tests
Photocurrent measurements of CdS/TiO2 B-NRs in various sensitization cycles on the FTO electrode were performed using a three-electrode configuration, with the CdS/TiO2 B-NRs photoanode as a working electrode, saturated Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, and platinum foil (2 × 2 cm2) as a counter electrode. A 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. An electrochemical workstation (IVIUM CompactStat) was used to measure current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the electrode, with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The illuminated area of the working electrode was about 1 cm2. In order to obtain simulated sunlight, a 300 W xenon lamp (Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co. Lt, LS-SXE300CUV) equipped with AM 1.5 filters was used as a light source, the power intensity of the light was 100 mW cm−2.
Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a Zolix Solar Cell quantum efficiency (QE)/IPCE measurement system (Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100) with a 150 W xenon lamp equipped with a monochromator (Omni-λ 3007). A standard silicon photodiode (SI 200-STD) was used to calibrate the incident light intensity. IPCE spectra were measured at the wavelength from 350 nm to 600 nm at a potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl. The generated photocurrent signals were collected using a data collector (DSC 300PA). Details of characterization can be found in the ESI.†
