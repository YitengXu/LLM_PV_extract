    , Accepted 26th October 2022First published on 27th October 2022AbstractDifferent cobalt phosphide particles having one-dimensional needle-like (1D CoP-N), two-dimensional sheet-like (2D CoP-S), and multi-dimensional pompon-like (3–2–1D CoP-P) morphologies were successfully synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method, followed by phosphorization post-treatment. A soft-template of a pompon-like Co(OH)X-P particle was first grown via a three-step mechanism: (1) the formation of a 2D micro-sheet, (2) the construction of a 3D micro-flower due to the radial growth of a 2D nano-sheet/silk on the micro-sheet, and (3) the perpendicular decoration of numerous 1D nano-needles on every 2D micro-sheet. After the phosphorization process, a hierarchical charge transfer route from a 3D micro-flower to a 2D micro-sheet and lastly to a 1D nano-needle array was effectively established in a pompon-like CoP micro-sphere in the presence of numerous electrochemical active sites. In order to serve as the electrocatalyst for triiodide ion (I3−) reduction in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the electrodes having 1D CoP-N and 3–2–1D CoP-P rendered their devices with satisfactory cell efficiencies (η) of 8.50% and 8.80%, respectively, which were better than the expensive Pt-based cell (8.24%). Under a room light illumination, the pompon-like CoP electrocatalyst rendered its device satisfactory performance up to 17.27% at 7 klux (for lampshade) and 14.22% at 1 klux (for office), implying the promising potential of CoP-based materials to replace Pt in DSSCs and other electrochemical devices.
1. Introduction
In recent years, extensive studies have focused on the synthesis of micro-/nano-structured electrocatalysts1–4 with an intention to accelerate a rate-determining step, i.e., the redox reaction of mediators, in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using earth abundant materials. Many high performance electrocatalysts have been designed to possess various micro-/nano-structures, including rod/tube/torch-like (1D),5–7 urchin-like (1D),8,9 sheet-like (2D),10–12 ball/yolk–shell-like (3D),13,14 and flower-like (3D)15,16 particles. However, the dramatic increasing demands on the performance of electrocatalysts drove many researchers to find the advanced materials simultaneously having large electrochemical active surface area, high conductivity, and low cost. Accordingly, the assembly of low-dimensional (0D, 1D, or 2D) electrocatalysts has been reported as an efficient approach to afford a hierarchical structure, and thereby to further enhance the overall electrochemical performance. For instance, the particles having hierarchical structures, including nanoparticle-decorated-rod (0D-to-1D),6,7,17,18 nanoparticle-decorated-sheet (0D-to-2D),19 nanoparticle-decorated-rock (0D-to-3D),20,21 rod-decorated-rod (1D-to-1D),17,22 rod-decorated-sheet (1D-to-2D),23,24 and rod-decorated-rock (1D-to-3D)25,26, would most likely provide better electrochemical activities than those particles having a single structure.
Our previous studies on material design revealed that both the intrinsic nature and the hierarchical structure of the electrocatalyst were two very critical factors to reach outstanding electrochemical performance. Many cobalt compounds, including oxide, sulfide, and selenide, showed competitive electrocatalytic ability to traditional platinum (Pt) in various electrochemical systems.21,27,28 On the other hand, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) were also reported as the earth abundant and high performance electrocatalyst for multiple electrochemical devices.7,29–31 To date, CoxSey-based and TMP-based electrodes rendered up to 10.46%32 and 9.76%7 of solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency to their DSSCs. These high records inspired us to explore cobalt phosphide (CoP) as the electrocatalyst for I3− reduction due to its good bulk conductivity, appropriate density of states, tunable particle morphology, and low toxicity.6,15,33 However, the applications of CoP as the electrode material are still very limited due to the severe self-agglomeration of CoP particles,33 resulting in the shortage of electrochemical active sites and ineffective charge transfer in the CoP-based electrode. Here, a soft-template of a Co(OH)X micro-sphere was synthesized to have a multi-dimensional pompon-like morphology, in which the 3D micro-flower was composed of several radially aligned 2D micro-sheets with very rough sheet-surfaces, decorated by numerous vertically aligned 1D nano-needles. After an appropriate phosphorization process, the Co(OH)X micro-sphere was gently transferred to the CoP micro-sphere without destroying the hierarchical morphology. As depicted in Scheme 1, a massive flow of charge could travel from one pompon-like CoP (CoP-P) micro-sphere to another, revealing a 3D inter-particle charge-transfer pattern. In each CoP-P micro-sphere, the facile 2D charge transfer was realized by radially aligned micro-sheets, followed by the 1D charge transfer through the vertically aligned 1D nano-needle array. Both the hierarchical 3D-to-2D-to-1D (denoted as 3–2–1D) charge transfer route and numerous electrochemical active sites were obtained simultaneously using the CoP-P electrode. Above all, superior electrocatalytic performance for triggering triiodide ion (I3−) reduction was achieved by the pompon-like CoP-P micro-sphere, as compared to the needle-like and the sheet-like CoP particles.

2. Experimental
The synthesis of CoP nano-materials with different morphologies were carried out by a two-step process, which was a hydrothermal process followed by phosphorization post-treatment. Co(OH)X with three different morphologies were synthesized as the templates by the following methods. (1) Needle-like Co(OH)X (denoted as Co(OH)X-N) was obtained via a hydrothermal process in a Teflon®-lined stainless steel autoclave at 120 °C for 12 h using a clear precursor solution containing 0.10 g of cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O; 0.34 mmol; 17 mM) and 0.06 g of urea (H2NCONH2; 1.0 mmol; 50 mM) in 20 mL of deionized water.34,35 (2) Sheet-like Co(OH)X (denoted as Co(OH)X-S) was obtained by the same hydrothermal set-up at 100 °C for 12 h using a clear precursor solution containing 0.73 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (2.5 mmol; 125 mM) and 0.70 g of urea (11.7 mmol; 585 mM) in 20 mL of deionized water.36 (3) Pompon-like Co(OH)X (denoted as Co(OH)X-P) was obtained by the same hydrothermal set-up at 90 °C for 12 h using a clear precursor solution containing 0.70 g of cobalt sulfate heptahydrate (CoSO4·7H2O; 2.5 mmol; 125 mM) and 1.40 g of urea (23.3 mmol; 1165 mM) in a 20 mL mixture of methanol/deionized water (with a volume ratio of 1/2). All the precursor solutions used in this study underwent an ultrasonic bath treatment for 1 h to achieve the complete dissociation of salts. All the Co(OH)X powders were collected by 5 cycles of the centrifugation process (under 7000 rpm for 15 min) using a washing solvent of deionized water and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight.
Different CoP electrodes were prepared by a simple drop-coating process, followed by phosphorization post-treatment. 20 mg of the as-prepared Co(OH)X (pompon, needle, or sheet) powder was individually suspended in 2 mL of deionized water, and then 90 μL of each suspension was drop-coated on a cleaned carbon cloth (CC) with an area of 1 cm2. Then, the electrodes of Co(OH)X/CC were phosphorized in a tubular furnace using an upstream reactant of sodium hypophosphite monohydrate (NaH2PO2·H2O) at 300 °C for 1.5 h with argon as the carrier gas. Finally, the CoP/CC counter electrodes containing three different particle morphologies, i.e., needle (CoP-N/CC), sheet (CoP-S/CC), and pompon (CoP-P/CC), were obtained. For comparison, a 50 nm-thick platinum (Pt) film was deposited on CC by a direct current sputtering method to prepare the Pt/CC counter electrode. All the materials, cell assembly processes, and analytical techniques used in this work are described in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structure and morphology

Fig. 1 shows the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of CoP-N, CoP-S, and CoP-P electrodes. All these CoP electrodes exhibited several diffraction peaks at 31.6° (011), 36.3° (111), 46.2° (112), 48.1° (211), and 56.8° (301), referring to the orthorhombic CoP crystal phase (JCPDS No. 29-0497). According to the signals of the standard CoP single crystal, there are two peaks located at 31.6° and 32.0°, which resulted in a merged signal at 31.6° in all the as-synthesized CoP electrodes. Similarly, the second group of two peaks (36.3° and 36.7°), the third group of two peaks (46.2° and 46.4°), the fourth group of four peaks (48.12°, 48.26°, 48.4°, and 48.54°), and the fifth group of two peaks (56.8° and 56.9°) from the CoP single crystal resulted in broad peaks at 36.3°, 46.2°, 48.1°, and 56.8°, respectively, for all the CoP electrodes. A negligible peak-shift among various as-synthesized CoP electrodes was attributed to their different particle sizes (vide infra). Besides, the low signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios were found in all the PXRD patterns of CoP electrodes, indicating the existence of many amorphous CoP crystal phases. Compared to the PXRD pattern of CoP-S, the other two PXRD patterns of CoP-N and CoP-P showed better S/N ratios, indicating that a more efficient CoP crystallization occurred in the needle-like and pompon-like Co(OH)X electrodes. This result can be substantiated by the common sheet-to-sheet stacking behavior of numerous 2D materials,37,38 which seriously forbids the crystal reorganization or recrystallization in the particles.

Fig. 2 shows the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of different Co(OH)X (Fig. 2a–c) and CoP (Fig. 2d–f) electrodes. It can be observed that all the Co(OH)X particles on the electrode were reasonably preserved their pristine morphology during the phase transition from hydroxides to phosphides. Both the Co(OH)X-N (Fig. 2a) and the corresponding CoP-N (Fig. 2d) electrodes were composed of lots of densely clustered needle-like particles with a diameter of around 100 nm and a length of about 8 μm. With a good adhesion to the CC substrate, the one-dimensional (1D) charge transfer route could be reasonably established by these needles from the clustered needle-bottom to the needle-tip. Both the Co(OH)X-S (Fig. 2b) and the corresponding CoP-S (Fig. 2e) electrodes contained several sheet-like particles with a lateral size of around 10 μm and a thickness of about 50 nm. The two-dimensional (2D) charge transfer pathway could be expected for both the Co(OH)X-S and CoP-S electrodes. The Co(OH)X-P (Fig. 2c) and the corresponding CoP-P (Fig. 2f) electrodes were composed of many pompon-like micro-spheres (∼8 μm in diameter), which were formed by the radial alignment of several micro-sheets (∼2 μm in lateral size) uniformly covered by numerous vertically aligned nano-needles array (∼50 nm in diameter; 100–200 nm in length). The distance between each micro-sheet was about 1–2 μm in average. Here, an obvious hierarchical morphology of CoP-P was successfully established. It is envisaged that the main stream of the charge could pass through one pompon-like CoP-P micro-sphere to another in an isotropic manner. In each micro-sphere, the radially aligned micro-sheets provided rapid and multiple pathways through a 2D charge transfer mechanism. Finally, the vertically aligned nano-needle arrays on the micro-sheets not only conducted the facile charge transfer through the 1D direction but also offered numerous active sites. Overall, the pompon-like CoP-P micro-spheres provided a hierarchical charge transfer route from the 3D micro-flower to the 2D micro-sheet and finally to the 1D nano-needle array (3–2–1D), as depicted in Scheme 1. Besides, the elemental composition and distribution within a pompon-like CoP-P micro-sphere were characterized by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), as shown in Fig. 3. It was found that about equal molar amounts of cobalt (46.08%) and phosphide (53.92%) elements were uniformly distributed in a pompon-like CoP-P micro-sphere, indicating a successful hydroxide-to-phosphide phase transition.

The nitrogen absorption–desorption isotherms of CoP-N, CoP-S, and CoP-P powders were obtained via Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis. In Fig. S1 (ESI†), the small hysteresis loop for the adsorption and desorption isotherms was found for all the CoP powders (CoP-N, CoP-S, and CoP-P), indicating their mesoporous/macroporous nature. Accordingly, most of the nitrogen absorption–desorption process would take place on the outer surface of a mesoporous/macroporous CoP particle, instead of the inner pore surface. The larger BET surface area was mainly attributed to the larger outer surface area of a CoP particle. From Fig. S1 (ESI†), the needle-like CoP-N exhibited a BET surface area of 17.45 m2 g−1 with an average pore size of 14.87 nm. The sheet-like CoP-S possessed a BET surface area of 15.93 m2 g−1 with an average pore size of 21.00 nm. The pompon-like CoP-P showed a BET surface area of 29.97 m2 g−1 with an average pore size of 25.44 nm. Among these CoP powders having different morphologies, the pompon-like CoP-P exhibited the highest BET surface area and the largest average pore size, owing to its 3–2–1D hierarchical morphology with the roughest particle surface (Fig. 2f). For the application in a DSSC, reasonable electrolyte penetration and adsorption/desorption of redox species can be expected by using the pompon-like CoP-P micro-sphere as an electrocatalyst.
3.2 Crystal growth mechanism of pompon-like CoP-P
During the synthesis of Co(OH)X, the particle growth was determined by the dissociation of cobalt salts (Co(NO3)2 or CoSO4) and urea (H2NCONH2) as follows. Co(NO3)2·6H2O → Co2+ + 2NO3− + 6H2O(1) CoSO4·7H2O → Co2+ + SO42− + 7H2O(2) H2NCONH2 + H2O → CO32− + 2NH3 + 2H2O+ 2OH−(3) Co2+ + xOH− → Co(OH)x(4)
In the aqueous solution, a very diluted precursor containing 17 mM Co(NO3)2 and 50 mM urea with a [Co2+]/[OH−] molar ratio of 0.17 (17 mM/100 mM)35 was reported to induce the crystal growth of Co(OH)X through the 1D orientation and thereby produce urchin-like particles. Our needle-like Co(OH)X (denoted as Co(OH)X-N) was obtained by using the same diluted aqueous precursor. On the other hand, a concentrated aqueous precursor containing 125 mM Co(NO3)2 and 585 mM urea with a [Co2+]/[OH−] molar ratio of 0.11 (125 mM/1170 mM)36 was reported to evoke the formation of sheet-like Co(OH)X particles through a preferred 2D orientation. By using the same concentrated aqueous precursor, our sheet-like Co(OH)X (denoted as Co(OH)X-S) was successfully acquired.
In this study, the pompon-like Co(OH)X micro-sphere (denoted as Co(OH)X-P) was synthesized in a MeOH/water solution containing the concentrated CoSO4 (125 mM) and urea (1165 mM) with a [Co2+]/[OH−] molar ratio of 0.05 (125 mM/2330 mM). The 2D crystal growth of Co(OH)X can be expected in domination. When the reaction time of the hydrothermal process reached 1 h, numerous ultra-thin micro-sheet-like particles were formed and were stacked together after drying (Fig. 4a). After 2 h, lots of nano-sheet/silk-like particles were irregularly grown at the possible defects on the surface of the micro-sheet-like particles (Fig. 4b). Some micro-spherical aggregations (∼1 μm in diameter) were found to be composed of nano-sheet/silk-like particles. After 4 h, many micro-flower-like particles (2–4 μm in diameter) were found to be constructed by radially aligned micro-sheets (1–2 μm in lateral size), where these micro-sheets were formed owing to the continuous growth and fusion of the previous nano-sheet/silk-like particles (Fig. 4c). In the presence of urea as the precursor salt, metal–urea coordination provided steric hindrance and induced a crystal growth in the radial direction.39–41 At this stage, the formation/assembly of the 3D micro-flower-like particle was in domination due to the fast crystal growth/aggregation of 2D micro-sheets. Therefore, each 2D micro-sheet aligned on a micro-flower-like particle showed a much smoother surface than the final product.
 Fig. 4  The schematic growth mechanism of the pompon-like Co(OH)X micro-sphere synthesized by different hydrothermal reaction times of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h, supported by the FE-SEM images at each stage. 
After 8 h, the particle diameter was further increased to 8–10 μm. Meanwhile, more and more nano-needle-like particles were vertically grown on the micro-sheets of the Co(OH)X micro-flower (Fig. 4d), indicating that the 1D crystal growth was in partial domination. Besides, the usage of a MeOH/H2O mixed solvent in this study would promote the formation of flower-like microspheres by lowering the dissociation of urea in solution.42 As a result, the slow release of hydroxide ions during the formation of Co(OH)X could allow an efficient confinement toward the crystal growth orientation. When the reaction was terminated at 12 h, the diameter of the Co(OH)X micro-flower was found to be 8–10 μm. Each micro-sheet surface on the Co(OH)X micro-flower was fully covered with the vertically aligned nano-needle arrays (Fig. 4e), indicating that the 1D crystal growth was in domination as compared to other directions. In summary, a pompon-like morphology for the Co(OH)X-P micro-sphere was successfully obtained via a three-stage crystal growth mechanism: (I) 2D micro-sheet formation, (II) 3D micro-flower construction via the aggregation of 2D nano-sheet/silk, and (III) 1D nano-needle decoration, as illustrated in Fig. 4. The first two-stage of the crystal growth mechanism can be substantiated by other literature studies reporting on the synthesis of the 2D-assembled 3D flower-like Co(OH)x,43 Ni(OH)2,44 CuO,45 and Mg(OH)246 particles.
3.3 Photovoltaic performance
The optimization of the pompon-like CoP-P/CC electrode was evaluated using a DSSC device, which was composed of a N719-adsrobed mesoporous TiO2 film as a photoanode, a CoP/CC electrode as a cathode, and an iodide-based solution as an electrolyte (see the ESI† for the detailed fabrication process of each component).26 In order to fairly compare the electrocatalytic performance of the as-synthesized CoP/CC electrodes, the solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of a DSSC was measured using the photoanodes covered by a metal mask with a diameter of 0.5 mm, leading to an identical active working area of 0.20 cm2 for all the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curve measurements. Besides, the statistical data of the photovoltaic parameters under an experimental condition were obtained from using five identical DSSCs, which indicates the usage of five photoanodes fabricated by the same procedure, five CoP/CC electrodes prepared by the same process mentioned above, and the same bottle of the iodide electrolyte. When varying the loading amount of the Co(OH)X-P suspension by 60, 90, and 120 μL on the CC substrate, three different CoP-P/CC electrodes (denoted as CoP-P-60/CC, CoP-P-90/CC, and CoP-P-120/CC, respectively) were obtained after the same phosphorization process at 300 °C for 1.5 h. In Fig. S2a (ESI†), the DSSC with the counter electrode of CoP-P-90/CC reached an optimal cell efficiency of 8.80% due to the highest short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). The satisfactory electroactive sites and film conductivity of the CoP-P-90/CC electrode were responsible for the result. Then, the phosphorization temperature of the CoP-P-90/CC electrode was further varied from 300, 400, and 500 to 600 °C for 1.5 h. In Fig. S2b (ESI†), based on the same N719-based photoanode, the increase in phosphorization temperature directly caused the decrease in JSC and FF of DSSCs, suggesting the diminishing of the electrochemical activity of the prepared counter electrodes. At higher phosphorization temperatures, the more vigorous crystal phase transition from Co(OH)X to CoP may cause the collapse of pompon-like particles, leading to the decreases in the number of electroactive sites and film conductivity.
Then, all the CoP-based electrodes were fabricated by using the same film loading amount (90 μL) and phosphorization temperature (300 °C). The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs with the counter electrodes of Pt/CC, CoP-N/CC, CoP-S/CC, and CoP-P/CC are shown in Fig. 5a. Considering the fluctuations in the thickness of a mesoporous TiO2 layer and the active working area of a TiO2/N719 photoanode, each experiment was performed by using five identical samples or cells. The active area of the DSSC was determined with the help of a metal mask, having a geometric diameter of 0.5 mm (i.e., 0.20 cm2 active area). Based on the TiO2/N719 photoanodes fabricated by the same procedure,26 the traditional DSSC using the counter electrode of Pt/CC reached an average cell efficiency of 8.24 ± 0.02% (Table 1), showing a small variation of ±0.02% in the cell efficiency, thus only accounting 0.24% of its average value. When using various CoP-based counter electrodes, the cell efficiencies of DSSCs decreased in an order of CoP-P/CC (8.80 ± 0.07%), CoP-N/CC (8.50 ± 0.13%), and CoP-S/CC (7.71 ± 0.12%) with tolerable variation accounting 0.80%, 1.53%, and 1.56% of their average values, respectively. Accordingly, the controlled quality of the TiO2/N719 photoanode ensured that the different DSSC performances can be solely attributed to the selection of different counter electrodes. Among all the CoP-based counter electrodes, CoP-P/CC provided the highest JSC (16.50 mA cm−2), which was mainly attributed to the following two key factors of pompon-like CoP-P particles: (i) the large BET surface area presumably offering numerous electrochemical active sites and (ii) the facile and directional charge transfer pathway from 3D-to-2D-to-1D (Scheme 1). The lack of the rough surface of the 1D CoP-N and 2D CoP-S particle/CC electrodes led to the lower JSC for the corresponding DSSC devices. Besides, the agglomeration of 2D CoP-S particles on the CoP-S/CC electrode would reduce the exposure of the electrochemical active sites,33 resulting in the least cell performance. Compared to the traditional Pt/CC counter electrode (8.24%), the hierarchical CoP-P/CC rendered the higher JSC and FF values, indicating its attractive electrocatalytic ability toward I3− and promising potential to replace Pt.

The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DSSCs with various counter electrodes are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Accordingly, the integrated short-circuit current density obtained from the IPCE spectra (JSC–IPCE) decreased in an order of CoP-P/CC (14.66 mA cm−2), CoP-N/CC (13.63 mA cm−2), Pt/CC (13.01 mA cm−2), and CoP-S/CC (11.44 mA cm−2), showing a good consistency with the results obtained from the J–V curves. The differences between the JSC–IPCE calculated from the IPCE spectra and the JSC obtained from the J–V curve presumably are due to the low IPCE resolution of the N719 dye in the ultraviolet region.47,48 In Fig. 5b, the DSSC performance with the optimal CoP-P/CC counter electrode was also evaluated under room light illumination (Philips TL5 14W/865 YZ14RR16/G, a correlated color temperature of 6500 K).49 At the light luminescences of 7.0 klux (2.20 mW cm−2), 3.5 klux (1.08 mW cm−2), and 1.0 klux (0.33 mW cm−2), satisfactory cell efficiencies of 17.27%, 15.75%, and 14.22% were obtained, respectively, showing the possible potential of DSSCs to join the indoor internet of things.
3.4 Cyclic voltammetry
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to measure the oxidation/reduction reaction of the I−/I3− couple at the heterogeneous electrolyte/electrode interface using a common three-electrode electrochemical system. The electrodes of Pt/CC, CoP-N/CC, CoP-S/CC, and CoP-P/CC were individually used as the working electrode, and the Pt foil and Ag/AgNO3 were applied as the auxiliary and reference electrodes, respectively (see the ESI† for details). In Fig. 6a, the reduction peak at around −0.4 V referred to I3− reduction, which is the rate-determining step occurred at the counter electrode (cathode)/electrolyte interface in DSSCs.
 Fig. 6  (a) Cyclic voltammograms, (b) ΔJ–v plots, (c) Nyquist plots, and (d) Tafel plots of different electrodes of Pt/CC, CoP-N/CC, CoP-S/CC, and CoP-P/CC. 
At a constant scan rate (v) of 100 mV s−1, the higher cathodic peak current density (Jpc) indicated the larger amount of charges transferred during the redox reaction. The lower peak separation potential (ΔEp) reflected the lower activation energy for I3− reduction due to the presence of a better electrocatalyst on the electrode. In Table 1, the values of ΔEp decreased in a trend of CoP-S/CC (1.01 V), CoP-N/CC (0.77 V), CoP-P/CC (0.73 V), and Pt/CC (0.39 V), indicating that all the CoP particles could trigger the I−/I3− redox reaction with a higher activation energy than that of the traditional Pt. The values of Jpc decreased in the order of CoP-P/CC (2.75 mA cm−2), CoP-N/CC (1.80 mA cm−2), Pt/CC (1.64 mA cm−2), and CoP-S/CC (1.39 mA cm−2), revealing the superior electrocatalytic ability of those CoP electrodes containing 1D CoP nano-particles.
At various scan rates (v), the CV curves of the electrodes of Pt/CC, CoP-N/CC, CoP-S/CC, and CoP-P/CC were obtained as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). For each electrode, the background current density difference between the forward and backward scans (ΔJ) was individually collected at a cathodic peak potential (Epc) at scan rates of 100, 80, 60, 40, and 20 mV s−1. In Fig. 6b, the slopes of the ΔJ–v plots of the electrodes of Pt/CC (11.4 mF cm−2), CoP-N/CC (21.7 mF cm−2), CoP-S/CC (14.8 mF cm−2), and CoP-P/CC (33.8 mF cm−2) were obtained, where the larger slope indicated the greater double layer capacitance (Cdl) and the bigger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) for I3− adsorption. Among all CoP-based electrodes, CoP-P/CC showed the largest ECSA, highest Jpc, and lowest ΔEp values, which were supported by the high BET surface area with an appropriate pore size and the optimal conductivity owing to the hierarchical morphology of pompon-like CoP-P particles. The CoP-P/CC electrode possessed 1.87 times higher ΔEp value than that of Pt/CC, indicating the weaker intrinsic electrocatalytic nature of CoP-P/CC. Nevertheless, the CoP-P/CC electrode exhibited a much higher ECSA (2.96 times) for I3− adsorption, thus causing larger Jpc (1.67 times) and JSC (1.09 times) values than those values of Pt/CC; this explains the better electrocatalytic and photovoltaic performances.
The electrochemical long-term stabilities of the traditional Pt/CC and our optimal CoP-P/CC electrodes were investigated via a continuous CV scanning for 500 cycles, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). After 100 cycles, the Jpc value of CoP-P/CC maintained 92% of its initial value. When it reached 300th and 500th cycles, the Jpc values decreased to 72% and 66% of its initial value, respectively, implying the possible poisoning of CoP active sites during the course of the measurement. In contrast, the Jpc values of the traditional Pt/CC electrode reached 70%, 56%, and 42% of its initial value after 100, 300, and 500 cycles, respectively. The better electrocatalytic ability and long-term sustainability of the optimal CoP-P/CC electrode can be once again substantiated.
3.5 Impedance and Tafel polarization plots
The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and Tafel polarization analyses were performed in alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) power modes, respectively, using a symmetric cell structure of the electrode/electrolyte/electrode. According to the inserted equivalent circuit in Fig. 6c, the Nyquist plots of various electrodes were applied to acquire the series resistance (Rs) by the onset point, the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) by the radius of the first semicircle, and the Warburg diffusion resistance (Zw) by the radius of the second semicircle.3,4 Based on the same CC substrate, the values of Rs are influenced by the conductivity of the electrocatalyst and the adhesion between the electrocatalyst and the substrate. In Table 1, all CoP-based electrodes exhibited smaller Rs values (3.48–5.13 Ω cm2) than that of the Pt/CC electrode (8.76 Ω cm2). This was attributed to the more compact adhesion obtained at the CoP–particle/CC interface due to the successful phosphorization process, as compared to the adhesion at the sputtered-Pt–particle/CC interface. Among all CoP-based electrodes fabricated by the same process, the optimal CoP-P/CC (3.48 Ω cm2) electrode exhibited the lowest Rs owing to its superior conductivity, compared to the others; where the satisfactory conductivity was attributed to the hierarchical 3–2–1D charge transfer route supported by its pompon-like morphology. Moreover, the lower Rct indicates the larger amount of charge transferred through the heterogeneous electrocatalyst/electrolyte interface due to I3− reduction. In Table 1, the values of Rct increased in an order of CoP-P/CC (0.32 Ω cm2), CoP-N/CC (0.47 Ω cm2), Pt/CC (0.49 Ω cm2), and CoP-S/CC (0.65 Ω cm2). The optimal CoP-P/CC electrode reached the lowest Rct, thus leading to the best electrocatalytic ability and the highest DSSC performance, which was substantiated by its largest ECSA, highest Jpc, and smallest Rs. It can be observed in Fig. 6c that the value of Zw increased in an order of CoP-P/CC (1.25 Ω cm2), Pt/CC (1.73 Ω cm2), CoP-N/CC (2.00 Ω cm2), and CoP-S/CC (9.38 Ω cm2), indicating an efficient ion migration of the iodide redox mediator within the optimal CoP-P/CC electrode. The larger Zw values of other electrodes may be attributed to the aggregation of electrocatalysts on the CC electrode.
In Fig. 6d, the logarithmic current density–voltage (LogJ–V) curves, known as Tafel polarization curves, were used to calculate the exchange current density (J0) of various electrodes at the absolute voltage ranging from 0.12 to 0.40 V, where the mass transfer resistance was negligible. When extrapolating the anodic and cathodic LogJ–V curves to 0 V, the J0 values decreased according to the order of CoP-P/CC (6.60 mA cm−2), CoP-N/CC (5.40 mA cm−2), Pt/CC (5.25 mA cm−2), and CoP-S/CC (2.39 mA cm−2), showing a good agreement with the JSC values obtained from the J–V, the Jpc values obtained from CV, and the Rct values obtained from the EIS analyses.
4. Conclusions
Three types of cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)X) particles having needle-like (1D), sheet-like (2D), and pompon-like (3–2–1D) morphologies were successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal process. After an appropriate phosphorization post-treatment, all the Co(OH)X particles acted as a soft-template and was gently transformed into cobalt phosphide (CoP) without suffering from morphological damage or particle aggregation. Among these CoP particles, the pompon-like CoP micro-sphere exhibited a hierarchical 3–2–1D morphology with the roughest particle surface, leading to the highest BET surface area, the largest average pore size, and the biggest electrochemical active surface area. Accordingly, pompon-like CoP-P/CC electrodes delivered the best electrocatalytic abilities by providing the largest Jpc, the smallest ΔEp, and the highest J0 toward I3− reduction. Meanwhile, the pompon-like CoP-P/CC electrodes possessed the least values of Rs, Rct, and Zw, which were attributed to its best electrocatalyst-to-substrate interfacial adhesion, the most facile 3–2–1D charge-transfer network, and the most suitable morphology for I3− penetration. Therefore, the DSSCs with the counter electrode of CoP-P/CC reached an optimal cell efficiency of 8.80%, which was higher than the cells with CoP-N/CC (8.50%), CoP-S/CC (7.71%), and expensive Pt/CC (8.24%). Under a T5 lamp illumination, the pompon-like CoP-P/CC electrode rendered satisfactory cell efficiencies up to 17.27% at 7 klux (for lampshade) and 14.22% at 1 klux (for office), showing promising potential to replace Pt with economic competitiveness.
