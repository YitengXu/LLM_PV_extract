    , Accepted 7th July 2022First published on 12th July 2022AbstractImmigration to Mars, which is expected to be powered mainly by photovoltaics, is one of the greatest dreams of humanity. However, the extreme temperature difference and high-energy cosmic radiation on the surface of Mars make it difficult for conventional photovoltaics to operate steadily over time. With their advantages of being lightweight, having a high irradiation tolerance, and an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE), perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown themselves to be a promising candidate for Martian applications. In this study, we simulated the low-intensity–low-temperature (LILT) environment of the Mars surface, and monitored the in situ device performance of PSCs. Surprisingly, the device PCE was not only maintained at a high level but was even improved slightly. Further investigation revealed that the self-healing effect of perovskites under LILT conditions could be attributed to the light-induced decomposition of the perovskite film and the β-phase perovskite recrystallization process at the perovskite/hole transport layer interface. Interfacial β-phase perovskites are stable at low temperatures, which can facilitate charge extraction and protect the perovskite bulk from long-term light damage. This study demonstrated the feasibility of PSCs and provides a reference for Martian applications.
1 Introduction
As the energy crisis intensifies, the world is showing increasing interest in the colonization of neighboring planets and moons in our solar system. In this context, Mars will be the first choice in the solar system. As the rotational period and tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane of Mars are similar to those of Earth, the days and seasons of Mars are comparable to those of Earth.1,2 Moreover, based on the average temperature of 210 K, the survival temperature can be ensured by developing insulation technology.3 Furthermore, Mars has abundant natural resources that may satisfy human industrial and agricultural needs.3–5 Therefore, migration to Mars is theoretically feasible and has significant implications for humanity.
Power-supply systems are vital for space engineering and Martian terraforming. Owing to the special nature of the space environment, nuclear batteries (also known as radioisotope thermoelectric generators, or RTGs) and solar cells are often employed. Although RTGs have the advantages of long lifetimes and high reliability, their extremely high production cost and limited output power (e.g., a 45 kg RTG with an output power of 110 W costs 70 million US dollars6) hinder their application in large-scale Mars probes or large-area Mars photovoltaic plants. With their advantages of being lightweight, safe, having a simple preparation process, and the feasibility of large-area placement, solar cells are the first choice of power supply on the Martian surface. Currently, the solar cells used widely in satellites and space stations are silicon or multi-junction photovoltaic cells based on III–V semiconductor materials.7 Because of the weak magnetic field of Mars, there is a high flux of high-energy particle radiation on the Martian surface, which is approximately 2.5 times higher than that at the International Space Station.8 The Martian radiation environment will seriously affect the stability of traditional space photovoltaics.9–11 Meanwhile, extreme temperature differences experienced at the surface would severely restrict the device performance, particularly in silicon-based photovoltaics.12 In addition, photovoltaic power plants require large-area and cost-controllable photovoltaics, thus limiting the adaptability of expensive III–V photovoltaic cells (US$100 per watt direct current (WDC) for III–V photovoltaic cells13 and US$0.34 per WDC for crystalline silicon14). Therefore, the development of photovoltaic technology to adapt Martian surface will be a keystone for the early stages of Mars exploration.
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which are potential game-changers among terrestrial photovoltaic technologies, have achieved a boosted efficiency of 25.7% at an unprecedented pace over the past ten years, which is comparable to that of single-crystal silicon photovoltaics.15,16 In addition to the attractive power conversion efficiency (PCE), other features, which include a high power-per-weight, mechanical flexibility, and high radiation hardness, render PSCs potential Mars-available solar cells.17–23 The irradiation tolerance of perovskite materials and PSCs in a simulated universal environment has been studied.19–21,24 In addition, the temperature tolerance of PSCs, including 25–85 °C thermal cycling and 130 K low-temperature stability, has been investigated.25,26 However, there remains a lack of long-term stability performance investigations of PSCs under low-intensity–low-temperature (LILT) conditions based on simulated Mars surfaces, which could be helpful in evaluating the application potential of PSCs on Mars. Hence, in this study, we present an in situ monitored PSC performance in a simulated LILT environment based on Martian surface conditions. We demonstrate the self-healing effect of the perovskite, which could guarantee the operational stability of PSCs in a LILT environment. These investigations indicate the great potential of PSCs as Martian photovoltaic-panel candidates.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials
Lead(II) iodide (PbI2; 99.99%), lead(II) bromide (PbBr2; 99.99%), formamidinium iodide (FAI; 99.5%), methylammonium bromide (MABr; 99.5%), cesium iodide (CsI; 99.99%), poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-tri-methylphenyl)amine] (PTAA; ), bathocuproine (BCP; 99.5%), and C60 (99.5%) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; 99.9%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; 99.8%) and chlorobenzene (CB; 99.8%) were from Sigma-Aldrich. Indium-tin-oxide (ITO) glass substrates (15 Ω sq−1) were purchased from South China Science & Technology Co. Ltd. All the materials were used directly without any further purification.
PTAA solution was prepared by dissolving PTAA powder in CB at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 with stirring overnight in a glovebox. The perovskite precursor was prepared by dissolving 163.4 mg FAI, 481.7 mg PbI2, 21.3 mg MABr, 76.7 mg PbBr2 and 50 μL CsI (1.5 M in DMSO) in 950 μL of a mixed solvent of DMF:DMSO = 4:1 (v:v) with stirring at 60 °C for 3 h.
2.2 Device fabrication
ITO glass substrates were cleaned using detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone, and isopropanol (IPA) sequentially and treated with UV/ozone for 10 min before use. Next, a thin PTAA hole-transport layer was fabricated by spin coating the PTAA solution at 4000 rpm for 50 s on top of the ITO substrates and annealing at 100 °C for 10 minutes. After cooling to room temperature, the perovskite precursor was spin-coated on the ITO/PTAA substrates, first at 1000 rpm for 10 s, then at 4000 rpm for 50 s, and 130 μL of anti-solvent chlorobenzene was dripped on the top of the perovskite film 5 s before the end of the spin-coating program. Moreover, the perovskite film was then annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. After that, 30 nm C60, 8 nm BCP, and 80 nm Cu were sequentially deposited via vacuum thermal evaporation using a metal shadow mask. The device area was 0.08 cm2.
2.3 Device and film characterization
Under normal conditions, the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured using a source measure unit (Keithley 2400) in an N2 glove box under AM 1.5G solar illumination (100 mW cm−2) from an Enlitech SS-F5S solar simulator. Solar cells were covered with a metal mask with an aperture area of 0.0615 cm2 during the measurement. For temperature-dependent measurements in the LILT environment (low vacuum, ∼1 × 10−3 Pa), a closed-cycle low-temperature vacuum probe station (ST-LN-500-1-(4CX-4PORTS), Janis Research Company, LCC) was employed to control the operating temperature of the perovskite films and solar cells. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) values of the solar cells were detected using a solar-cell quantum-efficiency measurement system (Enlitech QE-R). Electron microscopy images were obtained using a focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM; Carl Zeiss AURIGA Cross Beam) working at 30 kV and a distance of ∼7.7 mm with 20k multiplication. PL and TRPL spectra were measured at room temperature using a laser-scanned fluorescence lifetime/intensity imaging system (FLRM300, Time-Tech Spectra, LLC) with a 405 nm picosecond pulsed diode laser as the excitation source. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA). AC impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements were performed using an LCR meter (TH2826, Tonghui).
3 Results and discussion
The Martian surface environment is a complex system that experiences an extreme climate, the accumulation of dust, and high-energy cosmic radiation, which could lead to interruption of the power output of PSCs.20,27–29 To simplify the simulation process and focus on investigating the light and temperature effects on the PSC, only light and temperature variations on Mars were simulated without considering other environmental factors in this study. The test environment was set as shown in Fig. 1A.1,2 During the 12 h of daytime, the temperature was maintained at 273 K under a light intensity of 590 W m−2 (0.43·AM0, illuminated using a white-light-emitting diode), which dropped to 173 K at night. Considering the balance between stability and efficiency, we fabricated inverted PSCs based on a triple-cation perovskite system (Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3).30 A schematic of the PSC structure and the perovskite crystal is shown in Fig. 1B and C, respectively.

The J–V characteristics of the non-encapsulated PSC were initially measured in a glovebox under AM 1.5G illumination (Fig. S1, ESI†), and the PSC had an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.13 V, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 22.87 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 78.85%, and a PCE of 20.37%. The photovoltaic characteristics of the PSCs on a simulated Martian day were monitored in situ, where a bias of 0.96 V (VMAX of the initial states) was applied to the device for maximum power output, and the results are shown in Fig. 2A and B. It was observed that the PSC maintained its performance at a high level during the 12 h test in which the PCE and VOC remained unchanged. This suggests that the originally thermally induced decomposition of perovskite crystals is greatly limited under the LILT conditions, which guarantees a stable power output for the PSCs. Notably, the JSC showed a slight increase after 12 h of the daytime period. After maintaining the PSC at night (dark, 173 K, 12 h), the upward trend of the JSC did not stop, thus increasing the PCE. To monitor the device-performance changes at night, another PSC was subjected to simulated Martian night conditions (dark, 173 K, 12 h) and the J–V characteristics were measured every 30 minutes. The results are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), and it was observed that the performance of the PSC remained almost unchanged, indicating that low temperature alone has little effect on the device performance. To confirm the improvement of JSC, we further monitored the PSC performance variation over ten short thermal cycles (Fig. 2C). After every night-time period, the JSC increased slightly, resulting in ∼10% improvement of the PCE after 10 LILT cycles.

(C) Normalized J–V characteristics of PSCs measured during ten short thermal cycles. Light yellow denotes the daytime (273 K with 590 W m−2 illuminations), and light grey denotes the night-time (173 K, dark). A bias of 0.96 V (VMAX of the initial states) was applied to the devices for maximum power output during the daytime. The data are collected from 5 PSC samples, and the average value is shown in Fig. 2. 
According to a previous study, metal halide perovskites often suffer from severe light-induced degradation that can significantly affect the stability of the device.31 Although several studies have reported that light-induced degradation is reversible,32,33 the gaseous products resulting from the photodegradation can escape and render the degradation process irreversible, particularly when devices are under prolonged light illumination. In addition, PbI2 can also decompose into Pb and I2 after long-term white-light illumination.31,34 Prolonged light exposure did not improve the efficiency of the device. Unlike light illumination, the low-temperature conditions may lead to an increase in the device performance of the PSCs.26,35 Below 285 K, the phase transition of the FA-based perovskite, from the cubic α-phase to the tetragonal β-phase, was observed.36 The low-temperature-induced phase transition could contribute to the self-elimination of intrinsic defect states, thus improving the efficiency.26 However, the PCE enhancement at low temperatures is mainly attributed to the improvement of the VOC,35 which does not agree with our results. It has been reported that the conductivity of ITO changes with temperature,37,38 which may affect the performance of the devices, but no significant difference in performance was observed in our experiments under simulated Martian night conditions (Fig. S2, ESI†).
To understand the physical mechanism of JSC improvement, we employed in situ impedance spectroscopy (IS) in a simulated Martian environment. Fig. 3A shows a description of the measurement points during the environment simulation, and Fig. 3B displays the Nyquist plots from the IS spectra measured with a 0.9 V bias. The curves of the Nyquist plots are flattened semicircles superimposed by two adjacent semicircles. Each semicircle is characterized by a pair of resistances and capacitances in parallel, with the frequency constant given by the product of R and C (i.e., ω = 1/(RC)). An equivalent circuit for these devices was also evaluated, as shown in the inset to Fig. 3B. The parameters were analyzed and are listed in Table 1. In general, RS is considered to originate from the contact and sheet resistance of the device. The high-frequency impedance spectra correspond to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) between the charge-transfer layer and the perovskite absorber layer.39,40 In our case, the photoinduced change mainly occurred at the hole-transport layer (HTL)/perovskite interface; hence, the difference in Rct can be attributed to the variation in the hole-extraction process. By contrast, the low-frequency impedance spectra correspond to the charge-recombination kinetics (Rrec) at the grain boundaries and interfaces.40,41 As shown in Fig. 3C, when the light was on (points A to B), Rct and Rrec were reduced by one order of magnitude owing to the abundance of photogenerated carriers. During the daytime (points B to C), Rct was reduced slightly from 45 to 41 Ω, indicating that the charge-extraction process was enhanced slightly. In addition, Rrec increased from 0.28 × 103 to 0.31 × 103 Ω, suggesting a slight inhibition of charge recombination. When the light was off at the end of the day (point D), compared with the start of the day (point A), Rct and Rrec followed the same trends as the 12 h of daytime. At night (points E and F), Rct continued to decrease from 995 to 810 Ω, suggesting that charge extraction was further enhanced. Meanwhile, Rrec increased to 4.81 × 103 Ω owing to the suppressed charge recombination at low temperatures. On the second day (point G), when the temperature increased to 273 K, Rct increased to 971 Ω, and Rrec decreased to 1.58 × 103 Ω. Still, it demonstrated better hole extraction and a lower charge-recombination rate than the end of the first day (point D), which was in accordance with the further enhancement of PCE shown in Fig. 2. The IS results indicated that the physical mechanism of JSC improvement in the LILT environment was related to charge extraction and recombination at the perovskite and carrier-transport-layer interfaces. Since there was no obvious change in the device performance in the low-temperature dark state (Fig. S2, ESI†), this physical mechanism is related to illumination, indicating that the perovskite/HTL interface that is directly incident by light should be focused on.

To verify the carrier-transport properties at the perovskite/PTAA interface, we performed steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements for perovskite films with and without the HTL (shown in Fig. 4). A biexponential function was used to fit the PL decay, and the results are summarized in Table 2. In Fig. 4 and the subsequent figures, ‘after daytime’ means that the device was measured after 12 h of simulated Martian daytime (273 K, 590 W m−2 illuminations), and ‘after one day’ means after one simulated Martian day (12 h, 273 K, 590 W m−2 illuminations + 12 h, 173 K, dark field). As shown in Fig. 4A and C, the PL intensity and lifetime of the perovskite film without the HTL were almost unchanged throughout the entire test, demonstrating that the overall structure of the perovskite film remained intact. However, when the perovskite film was accompanied by the PTAA HTL, the PL intensity significantly decreased after daytime and thereafter continued to decrease after one day (Fig. 4B). Meanwhile, the average PL lifetime reduced from 17.7 ns to 5.7 ns after daytime and thereafter reduced to 4.3 ns after one day (Fig. 3D and Table 2). Significant PL quenching and fast PL decay indicate efficient hole-transfer extraction from the perovskite to the PTAA layer. This interfacial modifying effect that occurs at low temperatures might be the source of the JSC enhancement,42–44 which is consistent with the IS results.

To investigate the effects of the LILT conditions on the PTAA/perovskite interface, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in which the surface morphology of the perovskite films under illumination from different directions was characterized (Fig. 5). When illumination was applied directly to the surface of the perovskite film for 12 h, the surface perovskite grains were severely damaged (Fig. 5C). The blurred surface crystal boundary indicates light-induced decomposition of the perovskite. However, after one day, the blurred perovskite surface partially gained clarity, which might have originated from low-temperature recrystallization effects. By comparison, the perovskite surface underwent negligible changes when the light incident from underneath the perovskite (i.e., through the different layers) was in the normal working state. This revealed that the light-induced decomposition and crystalline reconstruction occurred only in the area where the perovskite was directly exposed to light.

(B–G) Top-view SEM images of the perovskite (PSK) films under simulated Martian conditions with illumination directions (B–D) from the PSK side and (E–G) from the glass side. (H and I) XRD patterns of the perovskite films with illumination directions (H) from the PSK side and (I) from the glass side. 
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, which can illustrate the evolution of the crystallographic structure, were carried out on perovskite films in a simulated Martian environment, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. They show that both the perovskite and residual PbI2 crystalline phases initially coexist. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 14.0, 19.9, 24.5, 28.4, and 31.8° can be assigned to cubic α-phase crystalline perovskite structures with Miller indices (hkl) = (100), (110), (111), (200), and (210), respectively, in the pmm (221) space group (a = b = c = 6.2853 Å).36,45 After 12 h of illumination of the surface of the perovskite film, new peaks appeared at 2θ = 31.2 and 36.3° (Fig. 5H), which were attributed to the tetragonal β-phase perovskite crystal (P4/mbm (127) space group, a = b = 8.9158 Å, c = 6.4083 Å36) with Miller indices (hkl) = (112) and (320), respectively. Meanwhile, the peaks of the α-phase perovskite were reduced, and the peak of PbI2 at 2θ = 12.6° disappeared. It could be inferred that the initial α-phase perovskite grains and residual PbI2 decomposed under long-term illumination, and the β-phase perovskite was generated at 273 K under the action of stress and the gravitational effect of hydrogen bonds.46 The XRD peaks at 2θ = 31.2° were further enhanced after being maintained at 173 K for 12 h, implying that the β-phase perovskite formed continuously from the decomposition products of perovskite. Notably, this low-temperature self-healing process occurs only at the interface where light-induced decomposition occurs. When light is incident from the bottom, the perovskite surface remains the same without the formation of the β-phase, suggesting that no phase transition occurs in the bulk.
According to these characterization results, we can summarize the photophysical mechanism of the PCE enhancement in Fig. 6. When PSCs operate during the daytime on Mars, long-term illumination induces decomposition of the perovskite crystals at the perovskite/HTL interface. The decomposed perovskite components are blocked and are retained at the interface, leading to the crystalline reconstruction (self-healing) of the perovskite. Light-induced decomposition and self-healing of the perovskite occurred simultaneously during the daytime on Mars while the latter continued during the night-time. This low-temperature self-healing process can not only restore the film damage caused by light-induced decomposition but can also optimize the interfacial contact for efficient charge extraction (as supported by the IS and PL results). In particular, the low-temperature stable β-phase perovskite formed at the interface can protect the perovskite bulk and guarantee the long-term stability of PSCs on the Martian surface and under other space LILT conditions.

4 Conclusions
In this study, we have preliminarily verified the stability of PSCs in a simulated LILT environment of the Mars surface. Through in situ monitoring of the device performance on a simulated Martian day, we observed that the device performance was improved slightly. Further investigation revealed that the self-healing effect of the perovskite under LILT conditions could be attributed to the simultaneous effect of the light-induced decomposition of the perovskite film and the β-phase perovskite recrystallization process at the perovskite/HTL interface. These newly grown β-phase perovskites are stable at low temperature, which can facilitate interfacial charge extraction and protect the perovskite bulk from long-term light damage. Our tentative study broadens the application of PSCs and provides preliminary research on the power-supply technology of Martian exploration.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of (A) the hypothetical Martian environment with (inset) the simulated test temperature and light intensity. (B) Typical n–i–p inverted CsFAMA-based PSC architecture, and (C) crystal structure of the CsFAMA-based perovskite material.	 

 	Fig. 2  (A) Normalized J–V performance with time and (B) J–V curves after different time periods of non-encapsulated devices under simulated Martian surface LILT conditions in one day. (C) Normalized J–V characteristics of PSCs measured during ten short thermal cycles. Light yellow denotes the daytime (273 K with 590 W m−2 illuminations), and light grey denotes the night-time (173 K, dark). A bias of 0.96 V (VMAX of the initial states) was applied to the devices for maximum power output during the daytime. The data are collected from 5 PSC samples, and the average value is shown in Fig. 2.	 

 	Fig. 3  
In situ AC impedance spectra from devices under simulated Mars surface LILT conditions (bias at 0.9 V). (A) Description of the measurement points, where light yellow denotes light on (590 W m−2), and light grey denotes light off. (B) Nyquist plot, where the inset shows the equivalent circuit. (C) Enlarged view of the Nyquist plot.
