Currently, many other technologies are also available for the CO2 reduction to produce hydrocarbons and/or alcohols. Such technologies include hydrogenation of CO2 through high temperature–pressure process, as a raw material for synthesizing industrial products through complex chemical processes and for biocatalytic conversion to hydrocarbons using algae.1 Nevertheless, the above high temperature–pressure and complex chemical processes are costly with significant energy required for the CO2 reduction, and the development of effective and vast algae with high CO2 conversion efficiency is still a great challenge.1Since the conversion of CO2 to simple C1 products such as methanol (CH3OH), formaldehyde (HCHO), formic acid (HCOOH), and trace amounts of methane (CH4) by using semiconductors such as WO3, TiO2, ZnO, CdS, GaP, and SiC as photocatalyst was demonstrated in 1979,3 photocatalytic CO2 reduction to produce marketable solar fuels has attracted extensive interest.2,4–6 Since CO2 does not absorb either visible or UV-radiation in the wavelengths of 200–900 nm, this process requires suitable photocatalyst, such as metal complexes and semiconductors, to absorb UV-vis radiation and transfer it to CO2.1–6 Heterogeneous photocatalytic CO2 reduction refers to the photoconversion of CO2 to reduce C1–C2 compounds using light-induced reactions over semiconductors, which exhibits a void bandgap that extends from the top of the filled valance band (VB) to the bottom of the vacant conduction band (CB).7 An optimal CO2 photoreduction system usually requires some characteristics such as: (1) the redox potentials of the photogenerated VB hole must be sufficiently positive for hole to act as an electron acceptor; (2) the redox potentials of the photogenerated CB electron must be more negative than that of the CO2/reduced-product redox couple; (3) reactants such as CO2 or CO32− can be adsorbed on the catalyst; (4) photocatalyst must not be prone to corrosion or production of toxic byproduct.7As an endergonic process, CO2 reduction requires hydrogen source and energy. Considering that the most abundant sources of energy and hydrogen are sunlight and water, solar photocatalytic CO2 reduction to produce fuels by using water as a hydrogen source thus has the potential to be the most feasible means to store intermittent solar energy and to recycle CO2, because, in principle, it can not only provide a package solution to the current energy crisis such as fossil fuels depletion, but also solve the environmental threats such as global warming caused by the increasing atmospheric CO2 level. The high redox potential of CO2/CO2− (−1.90 V vs. NHE, at pH 7.00) makes the one-electron reduction highly unfavorable due to the large kinetic “overvoltage” stemming from the structural difference between the linear CO2 and the bent CO2−. In contrast, proton-assisted multi-electron CO2 reduction steps are much more favorable by considering the relatively low redox potential (vs. NHE, at pH 7.00) as shown in eqn (1)–(5).7,8 CO2 + 2e− + 2H+ = HCOOH E° = −0.61 V(1) CO2 + 2e− + 2H+ = CO + H2O E° = −0.53 V(2) CO2 + 4e− + 4H+ = HCOH + H2O E° = −0.48 V(3) CO2 + 6e− + 6H+ = CH3OH + H2O E° = −0.38 V(4) CO2 + 8e− + 8H+ = CH4 + 2H2O E° = −0.24 V(5)According to the previous report,8 the CB levels of some semiconductors lie at a more negative potential than that of H+/H2 and CO2/reduced-product redox couples as shown in eqn (1)–(5), which makes them promising as photocatalysts for water splitting or CO2 reduction to produce solar fuels such as H2 and C1–C2 compounds. Generally, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency is measured by the product's yield (μmol g−1 or μmol g−1 h−1). However, the photoactivity usually depends on the quantity of catalyst, light intensity and lighting area etc., and therefore the CO2 photoreduction efficiency can also be measured by apparent quantum efficiency (AQE), which was calculated by using the product amount and the incident photon number as shown in eqn (6). What's more, when the products from the CO2 photoreduction system are complex, the number of reacted electrons refers to the sum of the reacted electrons to generate each product.9–11 (6)Photocatalytic CO2 reduction system and conditionAqueous photoreaction systemA summary of developments on the photocatalytic CO2 reduction in a photocatalyst aqueous solution suspension (aqueous photoreaction system), which is very popular in early stage, is given in Table 1. As can be seen, the great majority of aqueous photoreduction systems give CH3OH, and only a few systems produce other reduction products such as HCOOH, C2H5OH, CH4, CO and/or their mixtures.12–45 In addition to the necessary characteristics of a photocatalytic system as mentioned above, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity are mainly dependent on two factors: CO2 adsorption on the catalyst and photoinduced electron transfer towards CO2. One of the problems associated with this system is that the liquid H2O might compete with CO2 for capturing the photogenerated electrons from the semiconductor to produce H2 simultaneously, which may result in low activity and/or selectivity of the photocatalytic CO2 reduction system.17,18,36,45 In order to solve this issue, Arai and coworkers combined InP–Ru-complex polymer hybrid photocathode with a reduced SrTiO3 photoanode,46 which realised the Z-scheme system for the CO2 reduction to HCOOH, and found that this system gave a conversion efficiency from solar to chemical energy of 0.14%, improved by ∼367% as compared to that (0.03%) of a previous system utilizing TiO2 photoanode under simulated sun-light.47 Moreover, some photoelectrocatalytic system for CO2 reduction by using GaP–pyridine48 or Si–Re-complex49 as photoactive material have also been reported to synthesise CH3OH and CO, respectively. These reports indicated that both promoting the photogenerated carriers and restraining the H2 production during the CO2 photoreaction process can improve the conversion efficiency. Another aspect to be considered is the pH value of the suspension. Usually, photocatalytic CO2 reduction is carried out under alkaline solution in order to increase the solubility of CO2.14–21,27–30,41–44 The formed CO32− and HCO3− in alkaline solution can accelerate the CO2 reduction.50 Moreover, the OH− in alkaline solution also serves as a strong hole scavenger to promote the photoactivity.19 For example, the CH3OH yield can be significantly increased by adding NaOH solution into an aqueous photoreaction system.19 Generally speaking, O2 is expected as a product of aqueous systems in the absence of hole sacrificial reagent. However, the produced O2 may dissolve in the solution, release in outgas or adsorb on the catalyst surface, which makes it difficult for exactly detecting the O2 evolved amount. Moreover, the produced liquid fuels such as CH3OH or C2H5OH from an aqueous suspension can also serve as hole scavenger during a long-term reaction, which would affect the accumulation of products. Therefore, more steps such as changing the reaction system, using hole scavenger or improving the detection methods should be adopted to overcome these thorny problems. Most of all, an optimal process for the separation of the produced CO2 reduction products from an aqueous system needs to be developed.

A liquid-phase chemical reduction method was better than impregnation and in situ photodeposition methods for the Ag-loading.45Gas phase photoreaction systemA summary of developments on the photocatalytic CO2 reduction system containing photocatalyst and H2O vapour (gas phase photoreaction system) is given in Table 2. As can be seen, most gas phase photoreduction systems give CH4, and some systems produce other reduction products such as CH3OH, CO, C2H5OH, HCOOH and/or their mixtures.51–103 Different from the above aqueous system, the concentrations of gaseous CO2/H2O and the microstructures of photocatalysts are very critical influencing factors to the photoactivity and selectivity of the gas phase system. For example, Zhang and coworkers found that CH4 yields on Pt-loaded TiO2 nanotubes increased with the relative large concentration of H2O molecules surrounding the TiO2 nanotubes and high concentration of surface –OH groups, whereas the difference in the CO2/H2O ratio had little effect on the CH4 yield over Pt–TiO2 nanoparticle.63 This indicated the H2O molecule adsorption on catalyst can affect the activity of the gas photoreaction system. Because the microstructures and surface properties of materials determine the adsorption of CO2 and H2O molecules with active sites, which would lead to the different photocatalytic processes, and then to different products.52–69,83–102 In turn, the optimization and modulation of the semiconductor microstructure and surface property is a more efficient way to improve the activity and selectivity of a gas phase CO2 photoreduction system.

One is a continuous-flow reactor as shown in Fig. 1.61 In this setup, compressed CO2 gas is passed through a water bubbler to generate a mixture of CO2 and H2O vapour controlled by a mass flow controller. The reactant CO2/H2O gas is then introduced to the cylindrical continuous-flow reactor. Glass wool is placed in the reactor as the support for the glass fiber filter loaded with a thick film of photocatalyst. The glass wool support is also moisturised with deionised water to maintain saturated H2O vapour in the reactor. The effluent gas (e.g., CO, CH4, and CO2) concentrations are continuously measured by gas-chromatography (GC). This system has many advantages such as convenience for detecting the products on line, adjusting the reaction condition (especially the CO2/H2O ratio), and facilitating the reactants uniform adsorption on the photocatalysts. The other is closed-circulation system as shown in Fig. 2.82 In this setup, the catalyst is uniformly dispersed on the glass reactor. CO2 gas is followed into the reaction setup for reaching ambient pressure after vacuum-treatment several times, and then a small quantity of deionised water is injected into the reaction setup. The catalyst is allowed to equilibrate in the CO2/H2O atmosphere for several hours to ensure that the adsorption of gas molecules is complete. This setup is more easily applied in the laboratory, but it can not achieve detection on line. Much attention has been paid to optimise the reaction setup's construction, such as controlling reaction temperature or dispersing the catalyst on the optical fibre to accelerate the electron transport and improve the photocatalytic efficiency. For example, Wu's group has designed two typical gaseous photoreduction setups: an optical-fiber photoreactor (comprised of NiO/InTaO4-coated fibers) and a monolith photoreactor (comprised of NiO/InTaO4-coated pre-coated SiO2 sublayer on the internal channels of the monolith), and found the quantum efficiency of the monolith reactor was significantly improved compared to the optical-fiber reactor due to more effective photon energy utilization.96,97 Fig. 1  Schematic of experimental setup for photoreduction of CO2 with H2O.

Photocatalytic CO2 reduction conditionAs mentioned above, the photoactivity usually depends on the external environment and operating conditions, such as the type of light, quantity of catalyst, pH of the solution, CO2 pressure, amount of reductant and temperature etc. Firstly, increasing the CO2 concentration in an aqueous system by enhancing the CO2 pressure is an efficient method to improve the photoactivity and selectivity.13,14 For example, Mizuno's group reported that hydrocarbons such as CH4 and CH2CH2, which were not produced at ambient CO2 pressure, were obtained from TiO2 suspension under high CO2 pressure (2.5 MPa) due to the CO2 adsorption rate on the TiO2 surface being overcome by the hydrogen species adsorption rate with increasing CO2 pressure, and those hydrogen species then proceed to form lower-mass hydrocarbons such as CH4 and CH2CH2.14 As for a gas phase system, increasing the CO2 and H2O pressure can also accelerate the combination of reactant with active sites of the catalyst, which can also promote the photoactivity of CO2 reduction.63 Secondly, semiconductor absorbs light radiation with a threshold wavelength that provides sufficient photon energy to overcome the bandgap, and therefore the light wavelength and intensity would also affect the photoactivity and selectivity. Hou and coworker demonstrated that different mechanisms occur in Au nanoparticles (NPs) loaded TiO2-catalyzed gaseous CO2 photoreduction system under different light resource irradiation, which results in the different products such as CH4, CO, C2H6, CH3OH, and HCHO.68 Thirdly, although Fox and Dulay stated that photocatalytic reactions are not significantly sensitive to small variations of temperature because the bandgap energy is too high for thermal excitation to overcome,104 high temperatures are beneficial for enhancing not only the collision frequency and diffusion rate, but also the rate of thermally activated steps such as desorption, which occur after the photochemical reactions.51,63,101 Guan and coworkers attempted the photoreduction of CO2 with H2O vapour under concentrated sunlight using Pt/K2Ti6O13 combined with an Fe-based catalyst at high temperature, and found that the Fe–Cu–K/DAY showed significantly increased yields of HCOOH, CH3OH, and C2H5OH when the reaction temperature enhanced from 261 to 317 °C.101 Moreover, they demonstrated that water decomposition by the above photocatalyst is remarkably improved because high temperatures enhanced the H2 production rate, and the produced H2 was used in the CO2 hydrogenation process over Fe–Cu–K/DAY catalyst.101 Finally, using a hole-trapping sacrificial reagent can consume the photogenerated holes and lengthen the lifetime of photogenerated electrons, which also improve the photocatalytic efficiency.12,13,25 For example, it was illustrated that iso-propyl alcohol, acted as the positive hole scavenger in a high pressure CO2 reduction system, and can accelerate the formation of CH4.13 Whereas many aqueous CO2 photoreduction systems are carried out under an alkaline solution,14–21,27–30 and the OH− in aqueous solution can also serve as a strong hole scavenger to promote the photoactivity.19Photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reductionTiO2 and modified TiO2 photocatalysts(i) TiO2 catalysts. Since the first report on the photocatalytic CO2 reduction in 1979,3 many groups have studied the mechanism, activity and selectivity of the CO2 photoreduction by using a variety of semiconductors as UV-light-responsive or visible-light-responsive photocatalysts. As we known, the bandgap structure of semiconductor determines the feasibility of the CO2 photoreduction reaction, and different crystal forms of the same semiconductor usually show different activities for the CO2 photoreduction.16,31,52 In the majority of the CO2 photoreduction systems, TiO2, which naturally occurs as three polymorphs (anatase, brookite and rutile), is the most extensively applied UV-light-driven catalyst because of its high stability and durability with a low tendency to undergo deactivation and corrosion.12–25,51–56 Moreover, the effects of bandgap, crystal form, exposed facet, surface area/feature must be considered in the design and fabrication of catalysts for CO2 photoreduction. Therefore, extensive efforts have been made to improve the activity and selectivity of CO2 photoreduction by varying the microstructure (such as nanostructures with different particle sizes, crystal phases and exposed facets) and the morphology (such as nanoparticles, nanotubes and nanorods) of the individual crystals.12,15,16,29,52,62–66Crystal phase controlling. Usually, anatase TiO2 shows the best activities in the CO2 photoreduction among the three polymorphs due to its more negative CB position.12–24 Recently, the desired phase of anatase, rutile, or brookite were tuned by tailoring the solution pH in a hydrothermal process.16 The synthesised TiO2 nanoparticles showed remarkable activity for the CO2 photoreduction under both UV-vis and visible-light irradiation, which is attributed to the doping of carbon and nitrogen onto the TiO2, and the maximum CH3OH yield of ∼0.48 μmol g−1 h−1 was afforded by anatase–brookite bicrystalline catalyst in an aqueous system containing CO2-saturated NaHCO3 solution under visible-light irradiation, presumably due to its unique electrical band structures and efficient charge transfer between two crystallites.16 Moreover, CO2 photoreduction in the presence of H2O vapour was also studied on three TiO2 polymorphs that were designed with defect-free and oxygen-deficient surfaces.52 It was found that helium pretreatment of the as-prepared TiO2 at a moderate temperature could create surface oxygen vacancies (VO) and Ti3+ sites on anatase and brookite TiO2 but not on rutile one, and the production of CO and CH4 from the gas phase CO2 photoreduction system was remarkably enhanced on the defective TiO2 as compared to the defect-free surfaces. Among these three polymorphs, defective brookite TiO2 after helium pretreatment had the highest activity with 18.9 μmol g−1 production of CO and CH4 in 6 h UV-light irradiation, which is up to 10-fold enhancements as compared to the defect-free brookite one.52 The defective brookite was more active probably because the formation of VO is easier on brookite TiO2 than on anatase and rutile, and the experimental results suggest that defect-free TiO2 was not active for the CO2 photoreduction since no CO2− was generated, and the CO2 photoreduction to CO possibly underwent different reaction pathways on oxygen-deficient anatase and brookite via different intermediates (CO2− on anatase; CO2− and HCOOH on brookite).52Microstructure controlling. An approach to enhance the photoactivity is use of TiO2 in the form of nanotubes, nanorods and/or nanocrystals with different exposed facets.62–66 It appears that electron transport along the long axes of the one-dimensional (1D) crystallite is very fast and the charge separation is favored due to the high electron mobility, and the different crystal facets of TiO2 possessing different surface electronic and atomic structures which usually dominate the redox potentials of the photogenerated carriers and the surface active sites of the absorbed reactant molecules. For example, Vijayan and coworkers prepared TiO2 nanotubes using a hydrothermal method, and found that nanotubes calcined at 400 °C and showed maximum activity of the CO2 photoreduction to CH4 in the presence of H2O vapour.62 After calcination at >400 °C, the nanotubes undergo a transformation to nanorods, which showed lower activity than the nanotubes due to smaller surface area. Moreover, different crystal facets of the same crystal also show different photoactivities.64–66 For example, it was reported that anatase TiO2(100) facets exhibited a higher efficiency in the formation of CH4 and CH3OH than TiO2(110) facets because TiO2(100) facet has more active sites than TiO2(110) facet.64 Recently, Liu's group reported that the Pt-loaded {010} dominant anatase TiO2 nanorods are more efficient than the analogous P25 for the photocatalytic CO2/H2O vapour reduction system to produce CH4, which can be understood as the synergistic effects of both the unique surface atomic structure that the interaction of CO2 on the (010) is predicted to be stronger than that on both (101) and (001) and higher CB minimum of {010}.65 The combination of UV-vis absorption spectra with XPS valence band spectra was used to determine electronic band alignments, and the derived bandgap is 3.27 and 3.32 eV for the micro-sized and nano-sized rods, respectively. The unchanged VB maxima (1.96 eV) of both rods indicate that the CB minimum of the nano-sized rods is raised by 0.05 eV with respect to the micro-sized rods, therefore, the micro-sized rods show better activity than nano-sized rods and P25.65 Moreover, the same group subsequently reported that the hollow anatase TiO2 crystals and mesocrystals with dominant {101} facets can substantially improve the activity for CH4 generation from CO2/H2O vapour photoreduction system as a result of the synergistic effects of shortened bulk diffusion length of carriers for the decreased bulk recombination and increased surface area.66The particle size and surface area of photocatalyst are also crucial factors influencing the photoactivity and even selectivity.15,66 For example, Kočí and coworkers found that the highest CH4 (9.5 μmol g−1) and CH3OH (1.15 μmol g−1) yields were observed for TiO2 with particle size of 14 nm, while increasing or decreasing the particle size led to lower yields.15 Usually, the larger grain size will increase the distance that photogenerated carriers transfer to the catalyst surfaces, which may increase the carrier recombination. Although small grain size can shorten the electron transfer distance, too small grain size may also accelerate the carrier recombination.15 Whether in a gas or aqueous phase system, the adsorption ability of reagents (CO2, HCO3− and CO32−) depends generally on the specific surface area of materials, and the catalyst with larger surface area can show better photoactivity because of the better adsorption capacity and light utilization rate.66 Usually, TiO2 nanoparticles such as P25 would aggregate in suspension, resulting in a decrease in the surface area and compromising the photoreaction due to light scattering effects.24,25,53–61 To overcome these problems, TiO2 nanoparticles have been dispersed uniformly on the Nafion membrane or SiO2, and significantly more efficient CO2 photoreduction was observed by using TiO2 dispersed on a Nafion film or SiO2 support as compared to the suspended TiO2.24,25,53–56 In this regard, Anpo's group has made great progress in the CO2 photoreduction using TiO2 highly dispersed within zeolites and mesoporous molecular sieves.57–60 For example, highly dispersed TiO2 was prepared within the zeolite cavities by impregnation or ion-exchange process, and were tested for the CO2 photoreduction (λ > 280 nm) with H2O vapour to produce CH4 and CH3OH at 55 °C.58 It was found that TiO2 exchanged on Y-zeolites exhibited high reactivity and selectivity for the CH3OH formation while CH4 was found to be the major product using bulk TiO2 as well as TiO2 impregnated on Y-zeolite.58 This change in product's selectivity is surprising and needs to be understood. Moreover, micro- and mesoporous titanosilicates, such as TS-1, Ti-MCM-41, Ti-MCM-48 and Pt–Ti-MCM-48, have also been tested for the CO2 photoreduction.57,58 The results showed that Ti-MCM-48 exhibits the highest reactivity and selectivity in the series for the CH3OH formation, and this high activity may be explained as due to the combined contribution of a high dispersion of TiO2 particles, large pore size of the MCM-48 host and its tridirectional channel structure. Addition of Pt on Ti-MCM-48 resulted in an enhancement of CH4 yield by decreasing the CH3OH yield. Similar results were also observed by the same group by using Ti-MCM-41 as the mesoporous catalyst for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.58 They also studied the effect of TiO2 crystal form, dispersity, temperature, carrier, and CO2/H2O ratios on the photoactivity and selectivity of the CO2 photoreduction, and found that the Ti3+–O− was the active centre.57 It once again proved that oxygen vacancies (VO) and Ti3+ sites were the key factors to the CO2 photoreduction over TiO2.Surface property controlling. The surface properties of semiconductors would affect the CO2 adsorption form on the active sites and the performance of electron conduction.56–60 Therefore, surface modification is also particularly important for the CO2 photoreduction. Ikeue and coworkers have synthesized two types of Ti-β zeolites with hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties, and found that the H2O molecules added in a gas phase photoreaction system were easily able to gain access to the tetrahedrally coordinated titanium oxide species in the Ti-β(OH) zeolite, and the differences in the H2O affinity to the zeolite surface led to influence on the activity and selectivity for the CO2 photoreduction.59 Ti-β(OH) with hydrophilic property showed higher reactivity than Ti-β(F) attributed to the higher concentration of the Ti3+–O−, and a high selectivity for the formation of CH3OH was observed on the Ti-β(F) having hydrophobic property.Besides, metal such as Pt, Pd, Rh, Ag, Cu and Ni or their oxide species loaded on TiO2 or other semiconductor surfaces as cocatalyst are usually used for enhancing CO2 photoreduction activity and/or selectivity.17,19,20,22–27,34–36,54–56,67–69 For example, Wang and coworkers reported a facile method of preparing highly efficient platinized TiO2 (Pt–TiO2) nanostructured films via versatile gas-phase deposition process, and Pt nanoparticles (NPs, 0.5–2 nm) were deposited onto the TiO2 single crystals using a unique tilted-target sputtering (TTS) method.67 It was found that the Pt-loaded TiO2 nanostructured films with unique 1D structure of TiO2 single crystals coated with ultrafine Pt NPs films exhibited high CO2 photoreduction efficiency with selective formation of CH4, and the films with 1 nm Pt NPs showed the highest activity and reached a peak value of 1361 μmol g−1 h−1 at 5 h with AQE of 2.41%. The CO2 photoreduction mechanism of the Pt–TiO2 nanostructured films is schematically shown in Fig. 3.67 The Pt particle size with different energy level plays an important role in the CO2 photoreduction process. At very short deposition times, Pt NPs were extremely small and possibly had higher energy band separation due to the quantum confinement, preventing electron transfer from the TiO2 CB to Pt. But as Pt NPs become larger, their properties may be approaching that of bulk Pt, capturing both photoelectrons and holes and acting as recombination centers. Thus in order to promote the separation of photogenerated carriers, choosing the optimal size cocatalyst is particularly important. In addition, since the photoreduction of CO2 is multiple electron reaction, the separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons influenced by cocatalyst NPs supported on TiO2, can determine the photoactivity and selectivity of the CO2 photoreduction.22 Yui and coworkers found that using TiO2 treated by calcination and washing procedures for removal of the organic adsorbates, CO was photocatalytically generated as a major product in CO2-saturated solution, while CH4 was the main product using Pd-loaded TiO2.22 This experimental data also indicated that the effects of organic adsorbates on the photocatalytic products over semiconductors were noteworthy. Moreover, Yang and coworkers have confirmed that carbon residues formed during the catalyst synthesis procedures largely participate in the formation of CO over Cu-promoted crystal TiO2 catalysts, as demonstrated by the combined use of DRIFT spectroscopy and 13C labeled CO2.105 This result indicates that labeled experiment would be very important for understanding the detailed mechanism of the CO2 photoreduction. Wu's group has used Cu-loaded TiO2 derived from a sol–gel method for the CO2 photoreduction in aqueous suspension, and found the selective production of CH3OH with no other hydrocarbons such as CH4 and HCOOH was detected, and its photoactivity was twice as high as that the Cu-deposited on P25, while the pristine TiO2 or P25 showed much lower CH3OH yield, indicating the positive role of Cu-doping on TiO2.19 In their subsequent work, it was found that the Cu-doped TiO2 prepared from copper chloride and added in the early sol–gel stage showed better activity than that from copper acetate, and the Cu(I) oxidation state was the active species, moreover, higher copper dispersion and smaller copper particles on TiO2 surface correspond to a greater improvement in the activity of the CO2 photoreduction.20 Li and coworkers have reported the activity for CO2 reduction of a mesoporous SiO2 containing Cu-supported on TiO2, and found that CO is the main product with no CH4 produced over TiO2–SiO2, while the addition of Cu on TiO2–SiO2 resulted in the formation of CH4 as well as a 2-fold increase in the CO production rate.56 This change in product selectivity due to the presence of copper remains to be rationalised, and the CO/CH4 production rate decreased during the reaction course. Recycled photocatalyst still showed the production of CO and CH4 again but with a lower efficiency than with the fresh one. It is well documented in the literature that Cu0 is less active than CuI for the CO2 photoreduction and, therefore, activity decay could be due to the variation in the Cu oxidation state.56 Nevertheless, the origin of the above selectivity is unclear and, moreover, there is a lack of conceptual framework allowing rationalization of selectivity up to now.

(ii) Modified TiO2 catalysts. Development of solar fuels from CO2 requires that the CO2 photoreduction is carried out using natural sunlight, which contains less than 5% of UV radiation and about 50% of visible light. For this reason, many methods have been applied to the UV-light-responsive TiO2 to extend the photoresponsive range towards visible light. For instance, metal/nonmetal doping,18,21,61,69–71 coupling with other narrow bandgap semiconductors,28–30 photosensitization including dye (e.g., inorganic and organic compounds),37,38,74,75 noble metals (e.g., Au or Ag) with surface plasmon bands54,68,69 and quantum dot (e.g., CdSe)76,77 sensitization, are the most studied methodology.Metal or nonmetal doping. Transition metal doping has been applied not only to modify the photoactivity of TiO2, but also to influence the product selectivity.18,21,61,81 For example, various silver-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared by the sol–gel process controlled in the reverse micellar environment and used as catalysts for the CO2 photoreduction in NaOH solution.18 It was found that the main product was CH4 and CH3OH, and their yields increases when modifying the TiO2 by silver incorporation is caused by two mechanisms: up to 5% of Ag in TiO2 the Ag impurity band inside the TiO2 bandgap decreases the absorption edge and increases the carrier generation, above 5% of Ag in TiO2 Ag metallic clusters are formed in TiO2 crystals with Shottky barrier at the Ag/TiO2 interface, which spatially separates the carriers and increases their lifetimes.18 Mn-/Cu-co-doped TiO2 was also prepared via the sol–gel route as to obtain different nanocomposites for the CO2 conversion to CH3OH, and it was found that the Mn0.22–Cu0.78/TiO2 specimen yielded a maximum of 238.6 μmol g−1 with the highest quantum efficiency (26.5%).21 Moreover, Ce-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared by a simple sol–gel method, and then the Ce–TiO2 nanoparticles were dispersed on SBA-15 to form a Ce–TiO2/SBA-15 nanocomposite, which was tested as photocatalyst to convert CO2 and H2O to fuels, mainly CO and CH4, under UV-vis illumination. Compared with the pristine TiO2, TiO2 doped by 1 or 3% Ce improved the production of CO by 4 times due to the facilitated charge transfer induced by the doped Ce ions, the higher surface area of the catalyst, as well as the stabilization of anatase phase. Compared with unsupported Ce–TiO2, Ce–TiO2/SBA-15 remarkably enhanced the CO2 reduction rate, and Ce–TiO2/SBA-15 with a Ti:Si ratio of 1:4 demonstrated 8-fold enhancement in CO production and 115-fold enhancement in CH4 production.61Besides, nonmetals (such as N, C, or I) doped TiO2 can be used as visible-light-responsive catalysts for CO2 photoreduction.69–71 For example, good visible-light-responsive activity and selectivity for CO2 photoreduction to produce CH4 in the presence of water vapour was obtained over mesoporous N-doped TiO2 by means of noble metal loading.69 The unique mesoporous structure, the optical property, and the synergism with noble metal determines the overall catalyst performance. C-doped TiO2, derived from immersion and calcinations method by using citric acid (CA) as dopant material, showed evidently improved activity as a result of a noticeable shift to visible region and the enhancement of the charge separation efficiency, and CO2 was photocatalytically reduced to form HCOOH with a yield of ∼2634 μmol g−1 under the irradiation of the simulated daylight lamp for 6 h.70 Moreover, I-doped TiO2 also showed photoactivity for the CO2 reduction to produce CO under visible-light irradiation because I-dopant extended the absorption spectra of TiO2 to the visible light region and facilitated the charge separation.71 The principle of nonmetal doping is a regulation of VB structure of the semiconductor through nonmetal atom substituting lattice oxygen of TiO2, which can promote the VB position and narrow the bandgap of semiconductor. Generally, impurity level formed by nonmetal dopants may not became the recombination center of the photogenerated carriers. Therefore, nonmetal doping is an effective strategy for improving light utilization and photoreduction efficiency of TiO2.Dye-sensitization. The most widely studied light harvesters that have been exploited for the operation of solar cells are dyes that can be organic compounds or metal complexes with high extinction coefficients for the absorption bands. Dye-sensitised TiO2 as photocatalysts show the possibility of the CO2 photoreduction.37,38,74,75 For example, zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) has been adsorbed on TiO2 using different procedures such as impregnation, sol–gel and in situ chemical synthesis, and the activity of the resulting ZnPc/TiO2 was tested for CO2 photoreduction in NaOH solution.37 The highest yields of HCOOH, CO and CH4 were obtained using ZnPc/TiO2 prepared by the in situ method, while depositing ZnPc on commercial TiO2 resulted in lower yields of HCOOH, CO and CH4 as compared to those materials in which TiO2 was obtained by the sol–gel synthesis.37 Metal-doped TiO2 in combination with N3 dye (RuII(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate)2(NCS)2 as the sensitiser has been reported for the CO2 photoreduction in the presence of H2O vapour,74 and it was concluded that adding N3 dye to Cu/Fe/TiO2 coated on a glass plate as the support resulted in the enhancement of CH4 production by 2.46 fold. Very recently, Zou and coworkers synthesised a new Cu(I) complex with the ability to bind to TiO2, which exhibited impressive effectiveness for the selective CO2 photoreduction to CH4 in the presence of H2O vapour under visible light.75 The disadvantage of this approach is the low stability of the organic component that tends to photodegrade under photocatalytic conditions. One alternative to avoid unstable dyes is the use of inorganic light harvester particles such as CdSe quantum dots (QDs), which can be considered by themselves narrow bandgap semiconductors, have been used to sensitise TiO2.76,77 CdSe deposited on Pt/TiO2 has been prepared and its photoactivity towards CO2 photoreduction in the presence of H2O vapour under visible-light was studied.76 CdSe QDs can act as an antenna absorbing visible light and transferring the energy to the Pt/TiO2, and resulting in the formation of CH4 and CH3OH accompanied by trace amounts of H2 and CO, while Pt/TiO2 showed no conversion products of CO2. Subsequently, Wang and coworkers have prepared different sizes (3, 4 and 5 nm) of PbS QDs deposited on Cu/TiO2 for CO2 photoreduction, and found that deposition of PbS on Cu/TiO2 increases the photoactivity of Cu/TiO2 at least 3 times under white light irradiation.77 It is interesting to note that the 4 nm PbS QD-sensitised TiO2 shows the highest CO2 conversion rate among those PbS QDs investigated. This is confirmed by considering that the overall efficiency should result from a combination of photon absorption and the charge separation yield.77 However, the photostability of sulfide is the most concerned problem. Thus, studies on long-term test and material stability are necessary to have an idea of the potential of the above dye-sensitization method.Semiconductor coupling. One of the other promising approaches is to modify TiO2 with a narrow bandgap semiconductor which is functioned in the visible-light region.28–30 In this process, the photogenerated electrons from the CB of the narrow bandgap semiconductor excited by visible light could be injected in the CB of TiO2, resulting in the enhanced visible-light-driven activity. An effective CO2 photoreduction in KHCO3 solution using AgBr/TiO2 under visible light was studied.28 The experiment results showed that 23.2% AgBr/TiO2 had relatively high reduction yields under visible-light irradiation for 5 h, and the yield of CH4, CH3OH, C2H5OH and CO were 128.6, 77.9, 13.3 and 32.1 μmol g−1, respectively. It was found that AgBr/TiO2 was stable in the 5 repeated uses under visible-light irradiation due to the transfer of photoexcited electrons from the CB of well-dispersed AgBr to that of TiO2, which can avoid the decomposition of AgBr. Moreover, the combination of carbon-based nanostructured materials, such as multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs) and graphene, with TiO2 can induce interesting charge transfer and thus enhance the photoactivity of TiO2.78–80 It was found that the MWCNTs supported anatase TiO2 nanoparticles led to the main formation of C2H5OH for CO2 photoreduction in the presence of H2O vapour, while HCOOH was the major product using MWCNTs supported rutile TiO2 nanorods.80 Moreover, the combination of TiO2 and graphene led to significant enhancement of the photogenerated carrier lifetime, and then the improvement in activity of the CO2 photoreduction compared to TiO2 alone under visible illumination.78,79 The above results indicated that the semiconductor composite may give rise to the diversification of product, and lead to the selectivity of a certain product, which also depended on the condition of reaction system. Therefore, the diversity of products, the stability of composite materials, the relationship between the structure and product selectivity are worth consideration for the CO2 photoreduction.Noble metals with surface plasmon bands loading. A more recent approach, termed as plasmon photocatalysis, is the use of noble metals, such as Au or Ag with surface plasmon bands, to sensitise TiO2 or other semicondutors.42,43,68,69 For example, Hou and coworkers demonstrated a 24-fold enhancement in the CO2 photoreduction activity because of the intense local electromagnetic fields created by the surface plasmons of Au nanoparticles.68 The photostability of these noble metals depends on their redox potential, and for this reason Au appears as the most promising one that can avoid photocorrosion under normal conditions. Even though the price of noble metals is high, the fact that only very low loadings (around 1 wt% or below) are needed. In addition, noble metal surface modification can also adjust the electron transfer on the semiconductor surfaces, and promote the carrier separations, and the creation of surface oxygen vacancies on the materials can enhance the adsorption capacity of CO2 with the surface of materials, and then increase the photoactivity of CO2 reduction.22–25,36,54,67–69 From the above results and discussion, it can be known that the size and distribution of quantum dot or metal nanoparticles play a very significant role in the activity and selectivity for the CO2 photoreduction.Other UV-light-responsive catalysts and their modified materialsBesides TiO2, the other UV-light-responsive photocatalysts are also intensively used in the CO2 photoreduction.81–94 For instance, Pt-loaded cubic and orthorhombic NaNbO3 were used as catalyst for the CO2 photoreduction in the presence of H2O vapour, and it was found that the photocatalytic H2 evolution and CO2 reduction activities over cubic NaNbO3 were nearly twice of those over the orthorhombic one.91,92 The first-principles calculation reveals that the higher activity of cubic NaNbO3 can be attributed to its unique electronic structure, which is beneficial for electron excitation and transfer.91 Single-crystal Zn2GeO4 nanobelts with thicknesses of ∼7 nm and aspect ratios of up to 10000 were synthesised through a solvothermal route by Zou's group.82 The ultralong and ultrathin geometry of the Zn2GeO4 nanoribbon proves to greatly promote the activity toward CO2 reduction into CH4 in the presence of H2O vapour, and it was confirmed that the VB edge of Zn2GeO4 was determined to be 3.8 V (vs. NHE), more positive than E°(H2O/H+) (0.82 V vs. NHE), and the CB edge was estimated to be −0.7 V (vs. NHE), which is more negative than E°(CO2/CH4) (−0.24 V vs. NHE). This indicates that the photogenerated electrons and holes in the irradiated Zn2GeO4 can react with the adsorbed CO2 and H2O to produce CH4.82 The above report just indicates that Zn2GeO4 has photoactivity for CO2 reduction, but it is necessary to investigate the adsorption and combination form of CO2 on the Zn2GeO4 surface. For this respect, Fan and coworkers presented the structure and energetics of CO2 adsorbed onto the stoichiometric perfectly and the oxygen vacancy defect of Zn2GeO4 (010) and (001) surfaces using density functional theory (DFT) slab calculations.106 The major finding is that the surface structure of Zn2GeO4 is important for CO2 adsorption and activation, i.e., the interaction of CO2 with Zn2GeO4 surfaces is structure-dependent, and the ability of CO2 adsorption on (001) is higher than that on (010). For the (010) surface, the active sites O2c⋯Ge3c and Ge3c–O3c interact with the CO2 molecule leading to a bidentate carbonate species, and the presence of Ge3c–O2c⋯Ge3c bonds on the (001) surface strengthens the interaction of CO2 with the (001) surface, and results in a bridged carbonate-like species.106 In addition, a comparison of the calculated adsorption energies of CO2 on perfect and defective Zn2GeO4 (010) and (001) surfaces shows that CO2 has the strongest adsorption near a surface oxygen vacancy site. In other words, the oxygen vacancies on Zn2GeO4 are the active sites, which is similar to the defective TiO2 surfaces as mentioned above.52 Kudo's group demonstrated that Ag cocatalyst-loaded ALa4Ti4O15 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) photocatalysts with layered perovskite structures showed activities for CO2 reduction to form CO and HCOOH by bubbling CO2 gas into the aqueous suspension of the photocatalyst under 400 W high-pressure Hg-lamp irradiation, and found that the Ag cocatalyst prepared by the liquid-phase chemical reduction method was loaded as fine particles with the size smaller than 10 nm on the edge of the BaLa4Ti4O15 powder and showed the best photoactivities.45 There are several similar works on the UV-light-responsive catalysts reported, such as mesoporous ZnGa2O4,87 HNb3O8 nanobelts,94 and hexagonal nanoplate-textured micro-octahedron Zn2SnO4.95 Similar to the TiO2, the above mentioned UV-light-responsive photocatalysts suffer from the deficiency of visible-light absorption due to their large bandgaps. In view of the effective utilization of solar energy, it is indispensable to develop visible-light-responsive catalysts with high stability for the photoconversion of CO2. Therefore, many methods were developed to modify these catalysts, to extend their photoresponsive range towards the visible-light region.85,88 Ye and coworkers reported the mesoporous structure of N-doped Zn2GeO4 (ZGON),85 and an optimal balance between effective visible-light absorption and adequate redox potentials as well as improved crystallinity is achieved through adjusting the nitridation time. Compared with the ZGON synthesised by a solid-state reaction, the optimal mesoporous ZGON loaded with 1 wt% Pt exhibited enhanced activity in CO2 photoreduction with H2O vapour under visible light. Moreover, Zou's group simultaneously demonstrated that ZnAl2O4-modified mesoporous ZnGaNO solid solution showed higher photoactivity for CO2 reduction as compared to ZnGaNO and N-doped TiO2 due to its improved gas adsorption, narrowed bandgap and extended light absorption.88Visible-light-responsive photocatalystA more effective approach is to develop the new visible-light-responsive catalysts (such as BiVO4, Bi2WO6, WO3, N-doped microporous Zn2GeO4) with various morphologies (such as nanoparticle, nanosphere, nanotube, nanorod, and nanowire) and hybrid nanostructures (such as metallic cluster-decorated nanoparticle, quantum dots in nanowire, and core–shells nanowire) for the CO2 photoreduction.31–36,40–45,85,88,96–103 Those nanostructured materials, emerged as the novel catalysts to harvest solar energy because of their unique structural, optical and chemical properties, and exhibited many desirable photocatalytic characteristics, such as efficient and tuneable optical absorption, large surface areas, short charge carrier diffusion lengths and low reflectivity, which can enrich the flexibility to design a new generation of catalysts with improved CO2 conversion efficiency and selectivity.BiVO4 has inspired a great deal of interest because of its low toxicity and excellent visible-light-responsive activity.31,32 Liu and coworkers found that the visible-light-driven CO2 photoreduction can selectively produce C2H5OH by continuously bubbling CO2 in monoclinic BiVO4 suspension.31 Our group also found that the monoclinic lamellar BiVO4 in NaOH solution exhibited a selective CH3OH production under visible-light irradiation,32 and thought that the different catalyst structures and reaction conditions between the two works may be the main factor to the selectivity of the CO2 photoreduction. Recently, Huang and coworkers presented the well-crystallised orthorhombic Bi2WO6 hollow microspheres (HMSs) with sizes of about 2–5 μm displaying high CO2 adsorption capacity and visible-light-driven CO2 photoconversion efficiency to CH3OH without the aid of any co-catalyst in CO2-saturated solution, and found that the Bi2WO6 HMSs gave rise to 32.6 μmol g−1 of CH3OH, which is 25.5 times higher than that of Bi2WO6 prepared by solid-state reaction.33 The larger surface area and higher CO2 adsorption capacity of Bi2WO6 HMSs were the primary factor to efficient visible-light-driven CO2 photoconversion into CH3OH.33 Bi2WO6 was also demonstrated to exhibit promising activity for the CO2 photoreduction in the presence of H2O vapour.100 Ultrathin and uniform Bi2WO6 nanoplates of ∼9.5 nm thickness prepared by a hydrothermal route show great potential in the utilization of visible-light energy to the highly efficient CO2 reduction into CH4.100 On the one hand, the ultrathin geometry of the nanoplates promotes charge carriers to move rapidly from the interior to the surface to participate in the photoreduction reaction. This should also favor the improved separation of photogenerated carriers and a lower charge recombination; on the other hand, Bi2WO6 square nanoplate is proven to provide the well-defined {001} facet for two dominantly exposed surfaces, which is a prerequisite for the high level of photoactivity of CO2 reduction. Comparing the two works on Bi2WO6 for CO2 reduction, it is not difficult to find that the products between two works are different, which may be due to the photocatalytic conditions being different. One is carried out in the aqueous system; the other occurs in the presence of H2O vapour.Monoclinic WO3 with a bandgap of ∼2.7 eV is considered a promising visible-light-responsive catalyst, particularly for O2 evolution in the presence of an electron acceptor due to its very deep VB maximum.98,99 However, a rather low CB minimum (lower than −0.1 V vs. NHE, pH 7.00) has inherently limited its application in many important reactions such as, CO2 reduction to CH4 (−0.24 V, eqn (5)), O2 single electron reduction (−0.33 V) and H+ reduction to H2 (−0.41 V).98 As previously mentioned, crystal facet engineering might be a possible way to solve this problem. By investigating a couple of monoclinic WO3 crystals with different percentages of exposed {002}, {200} and {020} facets, Xie and coworkers demonstrated that a {002} dominant rectangular sheet-like WO3 crystal has an elevated CB minimum so that it can be used as catalyst in CO2 photoreduction to CH4. It is in contrast to the quasi-cubic-like crystal with a nearly equal percentage of the three facets, which show a much higher photocatalytic oxidation activity of H2O for O2 evolution.98 It was revealed that the surface of sheet-like WO3 crystals consists of a major top {002}, and minor lateral {020} and {200}. As shown in Fig. 4a, the bandgap of the quasi-cubic-like and rectangular sheet-like WO3 crystals are 2.71 and 2.79 eV, respectively. The quasi-cubic-like crystals have a deeper VB maximum by 0.22 eV than the rectangular sheet-like crystals, suggesting a stronger oxidation power of photoexcited VB holes in the former (Fig. 4b). After combined analysis of UV-visible absorption spectra with XPS valence band spectra, the elevated CB minimum of the rectangular sheet-like WO3 crystals by 0.3 eV is higher than the redox potential (−0.24 V) of CH4/CO2. So the photoexcited electrons from the CB of rectangular sheet-like crystal can viably transfer to the absorbed CO2 (Fig. 4c). Similarly, an ultrathin, single-crystal WO3 nanosheet of ∼4 nm in thickness was synthesised with laterally oriented attachment of tiny WO3 nanocrystals formed using a solid–liquid phase arc-discharge route.98 It was found that size-quantization effects in this ultrathin nanostructure alter the WO3 bandgap to enable the nanosheet to exhibit enhanced performance for CO2 photoreduction to produce hydrocarbon fuels that do not exist in its bulk form.98 The above works demonstrate a significant step toward making more efficient visible-light-driven catalysts for CO2 photoreduction by morphological and structural control.

Figure reproduced from ref. 99 with kind permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry, 2012. Taking the solar spectrum into account, it was supposed that “band engineering”, i.e., making a solid solution between wide and narrow bandgap semiconductors, will be a leading strategy in the development of visible-light-driven catalysts for sensitive CO2 photoreduction, as proved useful in the water splitting to produce H2. For the CO2 photoreduction, CuxAgyInzZnkSm solid solutions, customised with RuO2 or Rh1.32Cr0.66O3 co-catalyst with a small energy band gap <2 eV were studied for the CO2 photoreduction to CH3OH in NaHCO3 solution under visible light, and the maximum CH3OH yield (∼118.5 μmol g−1 h−1) was observed in the presence of RuO2/Cu0.30Ag0.07In0.34Zn1.31S2.41 Silver halides (AgX) decorated with Ag NPs have been used as a class of efficient plasmonic catalysts and have gained great interest in recent years.42,43,107 In this respect, metallic Ag species can significantly absorb visible light as a result of the localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) produced by the collective oscillations of surface electrons, which extends the light response of AgX to the visible region. Lately, regular cube-tetrapod-like AgCl:Ag nanoparticles and AgBr:Ag nanoplates were prepared by a facile and versatile glycerol mediated route.43 It was concluded that the as-prepared catalysts showed efficient activity on conversion of CO2 to CH3OH, and the CB edge for AgCl nanocubes and AgBr nanoplates is estimated to be −0.52 and −0.57 eV (vs. NHE), more negative than the redox potential of CO2/CH3OH (−0.38 eV). Correspondingly, the VB edge is determined to be 3.43 and 2.88 eV (vs. NHE) for AgCl and AgBr, respectively. It renders the photogenerated holes over the catalysts to oxidize water to generate H+ ions, and the novel heterostructured Ag@AgBr/AgCl also showed efficient visible-light-driven conversion of CO2 to energetic fuels.42In 2008, Wang and coworkers first reported polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as novel photocatalyst exhibited photoactivity for H2 generation under visible-light irradiation.108 Recently, Dong and Zhang directly heated the melamine to produce polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), and found that the replacement of melamine with melamine hydrochloride could result in porousification in the final product with much higher surface area (39 times) and more abundant pores, accompanied by a bandgap increase of 0.13 eV, and the porousification could enhance the photooxidation ability of g-C3N4 by providing more photogenerated holes and active sites, but lowering its photoreduction ability because of more difficult electronic excitation and abundant defects induced by porousification.102 Very recently, our group also synthesised two kinds of g-C3N4 through a pyrolysis process of urea or melamine, and found that the obtained g-C3N4 catalysts exhibited different photoactivity and selectivity on the formation of CH3OH and C2H5OH in a NaOH solution under visible light.44 The product derived from the urea (denoted as u-g-C3N4) showed mesoporous flake-like structure with larger surface area and higher activity for the CO2 photoreduction than the non-porous flaky product obtained from melamine (denoted as m-g-C3N4).44 Moreover, u-g-C3N4 can result in the formation of a mixture containing CH3OH and C2H5OH, while m-g-C3N4 only lead to the selective formation of C2H5OH. Compared with m-g-C3N4, u-g-C3N4 with larger surface area and higher photocurrent in suspension showed better performance in the CO2 photoreduction system. We concluded that the above different activity and selectivity for the formation of organic fuels over different products is possibly due to the differences in the crystallinity and microstructure of the two g-C3N4 products.44From the above investigations and discussion, it can be understood that different photoreaction conditions (such as aqueous suspension and gaseous system) can impel the formation of different products, and engineering the surface of a photocatalyst to favorable facets provides an important way to optimise the reactivity of the heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions because it is affected by both the electronic and surface atomic structures of the catalyst, which sensitively depend on the crystal facet of the catalyst with different orientations. Solid solutions and plasmonic photocatalysts can be also as new type effective catalysts for CO2 reduction, and materials with different microstructures may show different activity and selectivity. However, the above research works mainly illustrated that the materials can be as a visible-light-responsive catalyst for the CO2 photoreduction, but the discussion about the adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst surfaces, the excitation and transfer of electrons, and the relation between the microstructure and the product selectivity are lacking in these literatures. Thus, to delve into the mechanism of the activity and selectivity of the CO2 photoreduction, more advanced characterization and testing methods should be applied in this field because it would be very instructive for designing and optimizing of new type visible-light-responsive catalysts.Conclusions and outlookFrom this review, it can be concluded that we are still very far from having the scientific and technological capability to make this artificial photosynthesis practical to use due to the lack of selectivity in the product distribution, very low conversion efficiency and complex photocatalytic mechanism, though photocatalytic CO2 reduction for solar fuel production over semiconductor may not only alleviate the problem of CO2 emissions but also convert sunlight and CO2 into chemical energy in principle. Therefore, understanding the parameters that influence the photocatalysis of CO2 reduction is essential to developing this technology.First of all, choosing semiconductors with appropriate bandgap structure is the most significant element for obtaining high activity and selectivity of the CO2 photoreduction by taking the solar spectrum into account. It is supposed that “band engineering” will be a leading strategy in the development of visible-light-responsive catalysts for sensitive CO2 photoreduction. Although we do not have at the present predictive capability to design a material with special bandgap structure to enhance the visible-light-driven photocatalytic efficiency and selectivity, many strategies can be applied to improve the visible-light absorption through nonmetal-doping, coupling with narrow bandgap semiconductor, and photosensitizition by using inorganic or organic dye, noble metal with surface plasmon band, and quantum dot sensitisation. Moreover, different active sites usually affect the combining form of CO2 and H2O absorbed on the catalyst surfaces, and then the carrier separation and transfer efficiency under light irradiation, resulting in different activity and selectivity due to the multi-electron reaction process of the CO2 photoreduction. Therefore, the optimization of the bandgap structure and identification of the active sites of semiconductor by morphological and structural controlling may be effective ways for improving the visible-light-driven photoactivity and selectivity.As mentioned above, both the photocatalytic mechanism and product distributions including CH4, CH3OH, CO, H2 and HCOOH are very complicated, which limits the applicability of this process. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the link between the semiconductor structures and the product selectivity so as to have some chance of applicability for the photocatalytic production of solar fuels. In this regard, a better understanding of the photoreaction processes that occur on the catalyst surfaces during CO2 reduction under light irradiation, including adsorption–desorption of CO2 and intermediate products, as well as the role of adsorbed water is needed in order to elucidate the reaction mechanism which, in synergy with targeted synthesis, can improve overall efficiency and selectivity. Moreover, there is not much data about the mass balances of CO2 consumption or detailed analysis of the product distribution though many control tests were carried out to confirm that the carbon source is from introduced CO2 rather than from residual carbon on the catalyst surfaces. The use of 13C and 18O labelled CO2 can help to complete mass balances and determine the scrambling between CO2 and the organic compound. This may provide a more scientific way to get a clear understanding of the mechanism of the CO2 photoreduction.External environment and operating conditions must be also paid more attention to. The type of light, pH of the solution, CO2 pressure, amount of reductant and temperature determine the final productivity of the catalyst for the CO2 photoreduction. The present situation in the field is confusing and it is difficult to compare the performances of different catalysts due to the high variability in the above influencing factors. If these important conditions are optimised, this will not only provide a high reaction activity but also improve the selectivity and yield of products. Moreover, in order to realise the practical application of the CO2 photoreduction, the reaction conditions and process must be low consumption, simple and convenient. For this purpose, research on the CO2 photoreduction should be carried out under natural sunlight and mild conditions by designing and fabricating a photocatalytic system using a suitable reactor such as optical-fiber reactor, which may provide some new guidance for the practical application in future.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (21271146, 20973128, 20871096), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2081003) of China, and the Key Lab of Novel Thin Film Solar Cells (KF201111).ReferencesM.
