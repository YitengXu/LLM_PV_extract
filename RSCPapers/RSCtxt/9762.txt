    , Accepted 29th December 2011First published on 4th January 2012AbstractWe fabricated three-dimensional silicon nanopillar array (SiNP)-based photovoltaic (PV) devices using PbS quantum dots (QDs) as the hole-transporting layers. The core–shell structured device, which is based on high aspect ratio SiNPs standing on roughed silicon substrates, displays a higher PV performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.53% compared with that of the planar device (2.11%). The enhanced PCE is ascribed to the increased light absorption and the improved charge carrier collections in SiNP-modified silicon surfaces. We also show that, for the core–shell structured device, the thickness of the shell layer plays a critical role in enhancing the PV performance and around five monolayers of QDs are preferred for efficient hole-transporting. Wafer-scale PV devices with a radial PbS/SiNP heterojunction can be fabricated by solution phase techniques at low temperatures, suggesting a facile route to fabricate unique three-dimensional nanostructured devices.
Introduction
It has been revealed that three-dimensional silicon nanopillar arrays (SiNPs) with a high aspect ratio offer a potential route to build high performance photovoltaic (PV) devices due to their excellent optical and electrical properties. Theoretical simulations predict that SiNPs with an optimized morphology present an enhanced light-absorption capability in a wide spectrum range without any anti-reflection coating compared with planar thin films.1,2 In addition, it is possible to fabricate radial p–n junction solar cells using SiNPs with a low purity owing to the effective extraction of minority charge carriers.3,4 Specifically, three structures of PV device based on SiNPs have been proposed and demonstrated experimentally,5,6 as illustrated in Scheme 1. The most intuitive structure consists of an axial p–n junction along the axis of each pillar, as shown in Scheme 1(a). In the demonstrated device, the p–n junction was prepared by a high temperature (930 °C) phosphor diffusion method, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.37% was obtained.7,8 However, due to the axial p–n junction structure, the minority carriers have to travel a comparable distance to that in planar devices to be extracted; thus, high quality silicon wafers (with long minority carrier diffusion lengths) may still be required to achieve a high PV performance. The structure depicted in Scheme 1(b) illustrates the embedded architecture formed by completely filling the inter-space between the adjacent pillars with semiconductor materials, such as conjugated polymers.9 In such devices, the heterojunction is formed by SiNPs and the inserted matrix. The charge carriers flow along the radial direction of each pillar. However, the typical mobility of the embedded material is not high enough for the photo-generated charges residing far below the top electrode to be collected, which deteriorates the device performance. In some cases, due to the large size of the conjugated polymer as well as the limited inter-space between the adjacent pillars, it can be difficult for the polymer to fill the gap and the pillar array is consequentially only partially filled.10 The core–shell structure has been suggested to minimize the carrier transport distance in the shell layer by changing the transfer path from the axial direction to the radial one,3 as shown in Scheme 1(c). Light induced carriers are rapidly dissociated through the short radius of the nanopillars, which effectively reduces the recombination probability. Amorphous silicon fabricated by chemical vapour deposition and subsequently crystallized by rapid thermal annealing (RTA) have been deposited onto SiNPs to make radial heterojunctions. Due to the severe interfacial recombination, the device prepared in this manner exhibited an inferior PCE of 0.5%.11 An impressive PCE of 10.8% has been achieved in radial p–n junction PV devices based on 3.5 μm long Si nano-conical-frustum arrays on 1.5 μm thick planar Si supporting films via a novel self-powered parallel electron lithography method with sub-35 nm resolution. Ion implantation and a subsequent RTA process was used to form the radial p–n junction, and a layer of SiO2 was grown at 900 °C to passivate the silicon surface.12 Recently, both a SiN:H layer and intrinsic silicon layer have been utilized to passivate SiNPs and a PCE of 11.0% has been achieved due to the efficient suppression of interfacial charge recombination.13 Alternatively, high-temperature ion diffusion has been utilized to build radial p–n junction devices and a PCE of 7.92% has been achieved.14

However, the fabrication of the radial p–n junction requires a high temperature process, which results in the degradation of the minority carrier lifetime in low impurity silicon substrates because the silicon quality will deteriorate dramatically at the high temperatures involved in such processes as the metal impurities are able to diffuse in.15
Solution-processable lead chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs) provide a facile method to deposit uniform thin films with moderate charge mobility at room temperature.16,17 These II–VI group QDs are widely studied in a range of PV devices due to their tunable band gap and inherent improved stability over common organic semiconductor materials. In particular, lead chalcogenide QDs have gained extensive attention because they provide several possible routes to further boost the maximum performance of PV devices, such as hot-carrier extraction,18 multiple exciton generation,19 and infrared light absorption in tandem cells.17 Well passivated lead chalcogenide QDs exhibit moderate mobility and stability in the Schottky type PV devices.20–23 A stable PCE of 3.8% was observed in PbS QD Schottky solar cells without significant performance degeneration after four months of storage in a glovebox.22 Inserting a LiF layer between the QD film and the Al cathode retarded the oxidation of the metal electrode at the interface, which extended the lifetime of the unpackaged devices to tens of hours in an ambient atmosphere.20,23 In order to eliminate the extrinsic factors limiting the stability of the device performance, chemically inert gold was evaporated to form the anode in a solar cell with an inverted geometry based on a PbS QD/ZnO nanocrystal heterojunction. After 1000 h light soaking under ambient conditions, the PCE of unencapsulated devices only decayed slightly.24 Meanwhile, the oxide compounds on the PbS QD surfaces could passivate the trap states and inhibit charge carrier recombination, which led to a higher shunt resistance and improved PV performance.25 Bulk PbS is the main ore of lead on the Earth, which is stable under normal temperatures and pressures. The toxicity of PbS is relatively less than other lead compounds since it is insoluble and stable in human blood.26 PbS is decomposed at elevated temperatures (>250 °C), producing toxic lead compounds and sulfur oxides. However, the typical working temperature of terrestrial solar cells is well below the decomposition point of PbS. Furthermore, adequate encapsulation is expected to further reduce the toxic hazard and improve the device stability.
It has been found that excitons can be dissociated at the interface between lead chalcogenide QDs and other inorganic materials, for example, fullerenes,25,27TiO2,28,29 and ZnO.30–32 In our previous study, amorphous silicon was sputtered onto a PbS QD film to build PV devices giving a PCE of 0.8%, which proved the validity of PbS QD/Si heterojunctions.33 The SiNPs outperform sputtered amorphous silicon in both its mobility and light-trapping capability. It is thus interesting to inversely deposit PbS QDs onto SiNPs to combine both their advantages to achieve high-performance PV devices. CdS and CdSe QDs were coated onto the top surfaces of finished solar cells based on SiNPs p–n junctions made by conventional high-temperature diffusion and co-firing processes.34,35 However, the QD coating mainly contributed to the absorption of the already created solar cells by down-conversion and scattering effects. Here, we demonstrate a new technique to form radial heterojunctions via controlling the density of SiNPs and the thickness of the PbS QD layer. This technique provides a core–shell architecture of SiNPs coated with a few layers of PbS QDs to yield high-performance PV devices. High-temperature processes and high-resolution photolithography are avoided by the use of solution phase techniques. The core–shell structured devices benefit from both the light-scattering capabilities of the three dimensional pillar arrays and the unique properties of the solution-processable QDs.
Experimental
Preparation of SiNPs
SiNPs were prepared by a metal ion assisted electroless etching method.7 Cleaned crystalline Si (100) substrates (n-type, with a resistivity of ∼5 Ω cm and a thickness of ∼470 μm) were immersed in an aqueous solution of HF (4.8 M) and AgNO3 (0.02 M) at room temperature for 15 min. Subsequently, the substrates were dipped into a solution of HNO3 and then rinsed with de-ionized (DI) water. SiNPs were etched in aqueous HF (5 M) to remove the surface oxidation layer. The substrates were rinsed with DI water for 1 min and dried under a flowing nitrogen stream. The hydrogen-terminated SiNPs were immediately placed in a glove box with O2 < 1 ppm and H2O < 1 ppm to avoid any re-oxidation.

Methylation of SiNP substrates

Methylation of the silicon substrate was found to reduce the surface recombination velocity of charge carriers.36 The SiNPs were methylated to enhance the PV performance. After treatment with a phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) solution in the first step of the methylation process, it was observed that the density of the SiNPs was reduced as shown in Fig. 1. The sparse distribution was preferable for the QD solution to penetrate to the bottom of the SiNPs and completely coat the whole surface of each nanopillar.

Synthesis of PbS QDs
PbS QDs with diameters around 5 nm were synthesized according to the method developed by Hines and Scholes37 with a first exciton peak at 1190 nm, as shown by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image and absorption spectrum in Fig. S1†. In brief, the lead precursor was prepared by pumping 0.9 g PbO in 20 mL oleic acid for 4 h at 120 °C using a Schlenk line. Then, the lead oleate precursor was transferred into a glove box under an inert atmosphere, and 210 μL hexamethyldisilathiane in 5 mL octadecene was rapidly injected at 100 °C with vigorous stirring. After 5 min, the reaction was stopped rapidly by cooling to room temperature. The QDs were dispersed in toluene and precipitated by an excess of methanol to remove the oleic acid and unreacted debris. The PbS QDs were stored as a powder in a glovebox at ∼−20 °C.
Fabrication of the PV devices
The QDs were dispersed in octane and deposited on the SiNPs by a spin coating method. Then, the QD film was treated with 0.02 M 1,4-benzenedithiol in acetonitrile to remove the long carbon ligands to enhance the charge transport among the QDs. Two layers of QDs were deposited to minimize the pinhole area in the QD film. Afterwards, a 12 nm layer of Cu was evaporated on the QD film to yield a semi-transparent anode by a thermal evaporator. Eutectic Ga:In was applied to the back of the silicon substrate to form an Ohmic contact.
Characterization
The PV properties were characterized under simulated sunlight of 100 mW cm−2 generated by a Newport 91160 system with an air mass (AM) 1.5 G filter. The light intensity was calibrated by a standard silicon cell. A Newport monochromator (74125) and power meter (1918) with a silicon detector (918D) were used in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. All electrical data were recorded by a Keithley 2612 SourceMeter.
Results and discussion
SiNPs morphology effects on the PV performance
SiNPs provide the possibility to allow a short minority diffusion length and modest charge carrier mobility in high-performance PV devices by building the core–shell geometry.3 As shown in Scheme 1(c), the minority carrier diffusion length can be as short as the radius of a single silicon nanopillar (dozens of nanometers to a hundred nanometers) in radial heterojunctions. The hole transfer distance is the thickness of the shell layer. However, this design did not come into being and, instead, SiNPs were embedded into the bulk matrix of PbS QDs as described in previous reports,38 which resulted in a PCE of 1.8% due to the poor charge transport in the thick QD layer. A vertically oriented array of ZnO nanopillars was also infiltrated with PbS QDs to construct an embedded structure, yielding a PCE of 2%.39 An attempt to build the core–shell structure by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of PbS QDs onto SiNPs has also been reported,40 however, no PV characteristics have been presented to date. Furthermore, the PbS QDs deposited by ALD on the silicon nanopillar surface were discontinuous, which could cause many pinholes in real PV devices. Our initial efforts to build core–shell structures failed because the density of the SiNPs was too high to allow the QDs to infiltrate into the space between the adjacent pillars, as discussed below. Consequently, we developed a method to control the density of the SiNPs. The distance between the adjacent pillars dramatically increased when the structure was treated with a saturated PCl5 solution over time, as shown by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. 1. The slim pillars were etched away and only the thick ones remained. The enlarged inter-space between the pillars allowed the QDs to penetrate down to the bottom of the pillar array. Meanwhile, a conducting metal anode was uniformly coated onto the QD shells to facilitate efficient hole collection and could be achieved on the spatially well separated nanopillars. Though the light-trapping effect was slightly compromised after PCl5 treatment, the sparse nanopillar array still displayed good anti-reflection properties, as demonstrated in Fig. S2†, which shows the real devices after QDs and electrode deposition.
The device based on high density SiNPs displayed poor PV characteristics, as shown in the current–voltage (I–V) curves and the EQE spectra in Fig. 2. The device based on dense SiNPs presented a PCE of 0.036% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.338 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 0.30 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.36. The limited space between the adjacent pillars hampered infiltration of the QDs into the pillar array. The bulk QD layer was located on the top part of the SiNPs, which was responsible for the low Jsc and FF. Furthermore, the tips of the nanopillars without PCl5 treatment were too sharp and could be easily exposed to the metal electrode and act as a shorting path in PV devices. In addition, a relatively thick QD layer on top of the SiNPs blocked light from reaching the heterojunction of PbS/Si, where electron–hole pairs are dissociated. As expected, with a decreasing pillar density, the PCE was dramatically enhanced. The PV output characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The device based on SiNPs treated with a PCl5 solution for 2 h yielded a PCE of 5.9% with a Voc of 0.428 V, a Jsc of 26.4 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.52. The EQE spectrum displayed an enhanced response in the violet and visible range, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The QD layer showed a p-type behavior after ligand exchange treatment, forming a p–n junction with n-type silicon, as depicted in the band diagram in the inset of Fig. 2(a). We believe that more light can reach the PbS/Si heterojunction and be effectively converted into photocurrent for the sparse SiNPs than the dense ones without PCl5 treatment. Only the limited excitons generated in the QDs near the heterojunction contributed to the photocurrent. Meanwhile, the minority carriers in silicon cannot be effectively collected if they were too far from the anode. Thereafter, the devices with sparse SiNPs displayed an enhanced PV performance. Further decreasing the density of the SiNPs made little difference to the device performance, as summarized in Table S1†. This infers that QDs can reach the bottom of the SiNPs treated with PCl5 solution for more than 2 h. The I–V curves and EQE spectra dependence on the density of the SiNPs are also plotted in Fig. S3†.

QD shell thickness-dependent PV performance
As discussed in the introduction, the thickness of the shell layer plays a critical role in the charge transport and PV performance in radial junction devices. In general, it can be predicted that the performance of core–shell structured cells should be maximized with a dense and single monolayer of QDs if this layer is assumed to be free of pinholes. By further increasing the thickness of the shell layer, the device performance should deteriorate for several reasons. First, when the shell layer grows thicker, bulk recombination in the QDs becomes more serious due to their inferior carrier mobility compared with the silicon core. Second, the light absorption in the QD layer grows rapidly with the increasing thickness due to the large absorption coefficient of PbS. However, the extra excitons generated in the QD films recombine before they can reach the PbS/Si heterojunction due to the limited exciton diffusion length, which results in a loss of Jsc. Last but not least, the thick shell layer forms a barrier for charge extraction because of its large sheet resistance.16 However, it is rather challenging to coat a uniform and dense single layer of QDs on SiNPs. A few layers of QDs are necessary to deposit a homogeneous film without any pinholes in a real experimental setup.
In order to illustrate the dependence of the PV performance on the thickness of the QD layer, we fabricated a group of devices made by spin coating solutions of QDs with varying concentrations onto SiNPs. Fig. 3 displays the SEM images of the PbS/Si heterojunctions fabricated with 20 mg mL−1 and 80 mg mL−1 QD solutions. It was observed that the device architecture changed from a three-dimensional core–shell structure to an embedded one as the shell thickness increased. In the core–shell structure, most of the pillars were well separated from each other, standing vertically on the substrate. A thin layer of QDs was uniformly coated on to the surface of the SiNPs and the roughed substrate underneath the pillar array. In the embedded devices, the SiNPs were deeply immersed in a thick film of QDs, which was around 300 nm on average. Only the tips of the longest pillars could be identified. Fig. 5(a) shows the I–V curve dependence on the QD film thickness, which is summarized in Table 2. The optimal thickness was around five layers of QDs, which was achieved by spin coated 20 mg mL−1 QD solutions, as determined by the TEM images in Fig. 4(a). The QDs were closely packed on the surface of silicon core without any pinhole regions. In the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the PbS/Si interface, shown in Fig. 4(b), both the crystal fringes of the PbS QDs and the crystalline silicon can be clearly identified.

(b) The EQE spectra dependence on the wavelength. QD solutions with concentrations of 5 mg mL−1 (blue dotted line), 20 mg mL−1 (red solid line) and 80 mg mL−1 (green dashed line) were used to fabricate the films. The SiNPs were etched with PCl5 for 2 h. Idealized schematics of the core–shell and embedded device structures are also shown. 
In typical PV devices based on amorphous or nanocrystalline semiconductor materials, the formation of a wide depletion region is important for efficient charge extraction because the built-in potential ensures a minimal recombination rate within the depletion region. The photogenerated charge carriers in the quasi neutral region suffer from recombination before they diffuse into the depletion region. The depletion width of the PbS QD film was estimated to be around ∼110 nm in Schottky type solar cells,23 and ∼140 nm in heterojunction solar cells by capacitance measurements.41 The optimal thickness of the PbS shell layer is only ∼25 nm in the champion radial heterojunction devices, which is well below the reported depletion width of the PbS QD layer. This indicates that the thin shell layer in core–shell structured devices is fully depleted, resulting in an effective charge extraction. However, in embedded structured devices, the thickness of the PbS layer exceeds ∼300 nm. Both the depletion region and the quasi neutral region should exist, which can hinder the hole collection due to the extensive recombination in the quasi neutral region under the anode and will finally deteriorate the PV performance.
In the absence of a QD layer, devices based on both SiNPs and planar substrates displayed poor PV behavior because the formation of a metal silicide at the metal/Si interface resulted in a high recombination rate.42 This non-ideal behavior led to a low Voc of 0.05 V and a PCE of only 0.22% for the metal/SiNP device. By optimizing the number of QD monolayers, the PV performance was evidently enhanced with a Voc of 0.448 V, a Jsc of 29.2 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.499, leading to an efficiency of 6.53%. With an increasing QD layer thickness, the electrical output characteristics were first steadily enhanced and then decreased gradually, as shown in the detailed data in Table S2†. The initial performance increase was due to the elimination of pinholes. The steep increase of the Voc indicated that a full coverage of the silicon substrates by the QD layer was essential to create a large built-in field and prevent the formation of the metal silicide. A QD shell that is thicker than the optimum would finally compromise the advantages of a radial p–n junction by blocking a considerable amount of light from reaching the silicon substrates. In addition, the inefficient charge transport in a thick shell layer was also responsible for the fall off trend of the device performance.
To investigate the origin of the loss in Jsc with an increasing QD layer thickness, the EQE responses were plotted, as shown in Fig. 5(b). It is obvious that the EQE peak of the device with the thinnest QD shell is much wider than the one with the thicker QD layer, especially in the visible range. The low quantum efficiencies in the short wavelength range were due to an optical loss in the QD layer, indicating that the thickness should be kept as thin as possible. The normalized EQE spectra of the devices with various concentrations of QDs are also plotted in Fig. S4†, showing a clear tendency to decrease in the short wavelength range with an increasing concentration. In the case of the thicker PbS QD layer, the loss in the short wavelength region stems from an optical filter effect of the shell layer, since the absorbance of the PbS QDs grows rapidly with a decreasing wavelength, as shown in Fig. S1(b)†. In the case of a thinner PS QD layer, the main Jsc loss comes from the formation of a metal silicide at the pinhole area, which results in a high recombination rate. As shown in Fig. S5†, the EQE spectrum of the hybrid device without QDs displays a large infrared range loss due to extensive recombination processes at the metal/Si interface.42
Comparison with planar device structures
Devices based on planar silicon substrates with QD films coated from solution with different QD concentrations were also fabricated for comparison. The tendency of the PV performance was similar to the devices based on SiNPs. As the concentration increased, the performance reached a maximum PCE of 2.11% at 20 mg mL−1. Further increasing the QD concentration led to a poorer performance, as shown in Table 2. The Voc value for the best performing planar device was quite similar with that of the core–shell structured device. The ∼1.5 times higher Jsc value in the device with a radial junction architecture than that of the planar cell offset the reduction in the Voc due to the large interface. The planar device without a QD layer was also made as a reference. Due to inferior anti-reflection, as well as less efficient carrier collection, the planar device exhibited a PCE of 0.10%, which is lower than the one made of SiNPs (0.22%). In addition, the radial junction device displayed a higher FF than the planar one. Therefore, the superior performance in the radial junction cannot be explained solely on the basis of enhanced light absorption. The FF in the solar cell with a planar configuration was expected to be better than that in the device fabricated on vertical-aligned SiNPs, since it was quite challenging to prepare a high quality uniform coating of QDs with good electrical contact due to the high aspect ratio of SiNPs. Firstly, some of the sharp tips of the SiNPs could easily be exposed to the evaporated metal electrodes resulting in a detrimental current leak in the device. Moreover, because of the shadow effect of the SiNPs during the metal evaporation process, the deposited front electrode should have a larger series resistance than the planar one, which would also lower the FF. These two factors limited the presently reported PCE of the core–shell structured solar cells based on SiNP substrates, though the anti-reflection properties were impressive. However, the poor performance of the planar device cannot be fully understood given the higher conductivity of the front electrodes and the well defined PbS/Si heterojunction. We further analyzed the electrical characteristics of the planar devices to reveal the factors limiting the PV performance.
The shapes of the I–V curves provide unique insights into the junction structure, which allows us to distinguish between the different working mechanism of the radial and planar junctions. As shown in Fig. 6, the curves of the planar junction devices display S-kink shapes, which are different from those of the radial junction devices. The S-kink may be caused by the transport properties of the QD layer as the holes cannot be extracted sufficiently fast. The charge carrier mobility of the PbS QD film (∼0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1) is much lower compared with that of crystalline silicon (∼1000 cm2 V−1 s−1). Thus, the electric field distribution is asymmetric and arises from the imbalance in the charge carrier mobility (μe/μh), which is larger than 10000. The built-in electric field ensures that, for every extracted electron, a hole can be extracted simultaneously in the steady state under a 0 V bias. However, due to the inferior mobility, the accumulated holes in the QD layer formed a space charge region, which reduced the drop of the electric potential in silicon and increased the magnitude of the electric field in the QD layer. With an applied positive bias, the electric field across the heterojunction was reduced and electrons began to accumulate at the PbS/Si interface. In this case, recombination was intensified, resulting in a deteriorated electrical transport and, consequently, the I–V curves approached the inferior-mobility region, resulting in the S-kink shapes. In the device based on the SiNPs without PCl5 treatment, a thick QD layer was deposited on the top part of the high-density SiNPs and the radial junction was not well defined. The device structure was similar to a planar junction device, so the S-kink also appeared in the I–V curves as shown in Fig. 2a. Such S-kink shapes were not expected in the radial junction case because the electron transport direction was orthogonal to the electric field near the p–n junction. An increased bias voltage reduced the built-in field across the radial direction of the nanopillars; however, the electrons were extracted along the axial direction, which was not affected by the accumulated charges in the QD layer, and no charge accumulation was observed. This led to a smooth increase of the photocurrent in the core–shell structured devices. This comparison indicates that the introduction of radial junction nanopillar arrays could enhance the PV performance of planar cells, especially when low-quality materials with short minority carrier diffusion lengths are used.13

          PV performance at different angles of incidence
It is worth mentioning that the Jsc and PCE of devices with core–shell structures exhibited less dependence on the angle of incidence compared with the planar devices as well as the embedded ones, as shown in Fig. 7. As the angle of incidence increased, the total PCE dropped because the amount of light arriving at the devices decreased and the total reflection became stronger for all the three devices. Note that in all cases the device based on SiNPs showed a decreased dropping tendency of the Jsc and PCE than the planar ones, which is believed to be a benefit of their enhanced light harvesting capabilities. This incident angle-insensitive merit of the SiNPs is advantageous for PV applications in the real world, since it has the capability to generate more electricity even at large angles of incidence of sunlight. Meanwhile, the QD layer also contributed to the anti-reflection character due to the rough film morphology, leading to an enhanced device performance. Surprisingly, the embedded device presented a similar tendency of the PCE to decrease as the planar structure, which may indicate that the embedded structure loses its strong light-trapping capability if the majority of the adjacent space is filled with QDs. Under identical conditions, the device with the core–shell structure absorbed more light than the planar sample as well as the embedded one. The higher PCE of the core–shell structured device can be interpreted by the suppressed reflection from the front surface, which is consistent with the optical behavior of silicon nanocone arrays.43

Conclusions
In conclusion, PV devices based on core (SiNPs)–shell (PbS QDs) structures on a silicon substrate has been demonstrated with a PCE of 6.53% under AM 1.5 G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. This PCE is much higher than the device made of a planar substrate (2.11%). The increase in the PCE is ascribed to the enhanced light absorption by the array structures and improved charge carrier extraction in the radial junction architecture. We also show that the thickness of the shell layer plays a critical role in PV device performance in both radial junction devices and planar ones. This model may be applied to common three-dimensional heterojunction hybrid devices based on pillar arrays. In addition, colloidal QDs can be deposited by solution phase techniques, such as inkjet printing, which further highlights the versatility of the proposed PV device architecture.
