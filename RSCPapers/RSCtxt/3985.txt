The solution-processed OLEDs were fabricated using low turn-on voltages, which had performances with maximum power, current and external quantum efficiencies of around 8 lm W−1, 14.1 cd A−1 and 4.78%, respectively, displaying emission colors from blue to green and yellowish green. The materials had strong fluorescence emission colors between yellowish and bluish under UV irradiation.
Introduction
Fluorescent organic materials and their applications have gained great attention due to their potential use in several energy systems with lower cost, higher brightness, longer lifetime and lower power consumption.1–5 Owing to these advantages, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have recently received a great deal of attention in both industry and academic areas, particularly for high energy conversion and sustainable environmental protocols.6–8 Solution processing and evaporation methods are well-known fabrication methods for OLEDs.9,10 Solution processing in fabricating devices has widely recognized advantages over vacuum thermal deposition technology, since solution-processed films provide low-cost fabrication and large area printable OLEDs with high performance, especially for small molecule devices. Although several small materials have been applied for OLEDs fabricated by vacuum-evaporation technology, most of them are not suitable for solution processing methods on account of inadequate solubility and crystallization tendency problems.11–14
In addition to the solution-processability of small molecules, efficient charge injection and charge transport balance are also very important for the performance of solution-processed device fabrications.15–17 In order to obtain strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), push–pull heteroaromatic π-conjugated systems, which are a significant method of adjusting the electronic properties, are well-known models, such as donor–acceptor (D–A) and donor-π bridge-acceptor (D–π–A) systems. In particular, the molecular arrangement of D–π–A systems leads to terminal electron donor and acceptor group connection via a π-conjugated linker. This ICT involves a new low-energy molecular orbital, accessible through visible light excitation, which is responsible for the polarization of the materials.18–21 Various π-spacers and donor/acceptor units have been used in the design and development of aromatic push–pull systems for solution-processable fluorescence devices. Thieno[3,2-b]thiophenes (TT) have rigid, electron-rich and flat delocalized structures, making them promising π-bridges and donors to construct conjugated and low band gap organic semiconductors for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic solar cells (OSCs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), lighting lasers and photosensitizers.22–33 Another important building block is triphenylamine (TPA), having an ionization potential of 6.80 eV, lower than many organic/inorganic skeletons, which makes TPA a very strong electron-donating group for electronic materials. Moreover, TPA has a propeller-like shape with a torsion angle of 41.7° leading to a nonplanar structure with limiting intramolecular motion, which provides the resultant fluorescent molecule in solution with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) in the solid-state.34–38 Dimesitylboron (DMB), a member of the organoboron family, is at the forefront of strong electron acceptor groups as the boron atom has an empty p-orbital, which makes it a strong electron-withdrawing unit. That is why DMBs are used in D–A or D–π–A models to provide the system with push–pull interaction and create a low ICT energy for fluorescence materials.39–44
In this work, two novel D–π–A-type materials, M1 and M2, having dimesitylboron and triphenylamine groups as acceptor and donor units, respectively, and –CNPh and –Ph substituted thieno[3,2-b]thiophenes (TTs) as π-spacers were designed and synthesized. Their photophysical and electrochemical properties were thoroughly investigated. Moreover, they were used as small molecule emitters in organic light-emitting diodes, fabricated by a solution-process, using low voltage. M1 and M2 displayed remarkable properties such as perfect solution and solid-state quantum efficiencies reaching 100 and 76% and mega Stokes shift of 120 nm. Their devices, prepared by solution processing, had max current and power efficiencies of 14.1 cd A−1 and 7.94 lm W−1, respectively, and were achieved by solution processes for electroluminescence materials.
Results and discussion
Design and synthesis
Thienothiophenes (TTs) (5a,b) were synthesized according to our previously reported methods.23–28 Initially, the synthesis of the core units, thieno[3,2-b]thiophens 3a,b, was conducted starting from 3-bromothiophene 1, from which monoketones, 2a,b, were constructed in a one-pot three step reaction, (i) lithiation of 1 with n-butyllithium at −78 °C, (ii) additions of elemental sulfur and, then, (iii) 4-(2-bromoacetyl)benzonitrile. Their precursors, monoketones (2a,b), were prepared in 81 and 77% yields, respectively. The ring closure reactions in the presence of polyphosphoric acid in refluxing chlorobenzene gave the TTs 3a,b in 86 and 84% yields, which were then brominated with NBS to obtain the brominated TTs (4a,b) in 86 and 78% yields, respectively. They were subjected to palladium (0) catalyzed Suzuki coupling with TPA-borolane to give 5a,b in 86 and 82% yields, respectively. Lithiation of 5a,b with t-BuLi and then the addition of dimesitylboron fluoride produced the target materials, M1 and M2, in 88 and 84% yields, respectively (Scheme 1).

Reagents conditions: (i) n-BuLi, S8, alfa-bromoketones, Et2O, −78 °C to r.t.; (ii) PPA, chlorobenzene, reflux; (iii) NBS, DMF, −10 °C; (iv) 4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-triphenylamine, Pd(PPh3)4, K2CO3, THF, 80 °C; (v) t-BuLi, dimesitylboron fluoride, THF, −78 °C to room temperature. 
Photophysical properties
Photophysical properties of all the compounds were investigated (Table 1). As expected, the presence of the dimesitylboron unit at the peripherals had a significant effect on the optical properties. While 5a and 5b displayed π–π* absorptions around 365 and 352 nm, respectively, the dimesitylboron substituted materials M1 and M2 had absorptions with a red shift at around 408 and 377 nm, respectively (Fig. 1a). The optical band gaps were calculated to be 2.62 and 2.67 eV using onset wavelengths of 474 and 465 nm for M1 and M2, respectively. Moreover, the band gaps of the precursors 5a and 5b were also calculated, which had higher optical band gaps of 2.88 and 2.99 eV, respectively, compared to M1 and M2. This is because of the lower onset wavelengths of 5a-b. Both the absorbance and band gap values of M1 and M2 clearly showed that the addition of the dimesitylboron group led to higher conjugations and stronger pull–push interactions suggesting bathochromic shifts of π–π* transitions for D–π–A systems. The emission measurements of M1 and M2 were then performed in THF (Fig. 1b). M1 and M2 displayed fluorescence maxima of 528 and 495 nm, respectively. A similar trend of absorption with the emission bands, with longer wavelength emissions for M1 (528 nm) and M2 (495 nm), was observed compared to 5a-b. All the materials displayed mega Stokes shifts (>100 nm), specifying a fast relaxation from the excited state to the ground state owing to strong intramolecular energy transfer between the groups, emitting light with a remarkable bathochromic shift. The 4-CNPh substituted M1 had longer absorption and emission values compared to Ph substituted M2, which could be due to the presence of a strong electron-withdrawing CN unit, providing more efficient charge transfer properties to the D–π–A system. Dimesitylboron substituted M1 and M2 displayed excellent solid-state and in solution quantum efficiencies. While the solid-state quantum yields were measured to be 76 and 72% for M1 and M2, respectively, the in solution quantum efficiencies reached 100 and 95% for M1 and M2 in THF, respectively. The quantum efficiencies in solution clearly showed that M1 and M2 emit almost quantitatively all of the absorbed photons with excellent performance compared to many recent fluorophores available in the literature.45–48 They also had high solid state quantum yields of 76% (M1) and 72% (M2). A possible explanation for this is that the DMB-TT-TPA system cannot be stacked properly in the solid state as it consists of combinations of bulky groups of TPA, which is next to the phenyl moiety on the TT, and DMB, generating aggregation induced emission (AIE) features. The quantum yield reaching 100% in the solution indicates a more flexible structure leading to a better intermolecular charge transfer.

 Fig. 1  (a) Absorption and (b) emission of M1 and M2 in THF. 
In addition to solution state photophysical measurements, absorption and emission properties of M1 and M2 films coated on ITO were investigated. Solid state UV maximums were determined as 429 and 417 nm for M1 and M2, along with their emissions at 531 and 500 nm, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI‡). As expected, solid state absorption and emission maximums had red shifts compared to their absorptions and emissions in THF, indicating an enhancement of π conjugation in the film forms.
In order to investigate the charge transfer nature of M1 and M2 in detail, their solvatochromic behaviors were investigated in nine different solvents, having different polarities from polar to nonpolar, i.e. DMSO, DMF, acetonitrile, acetone, chloroform, dichloromethane, chlorobenzene, toluene and hexane (Table S1, ESI‡). While they had no significant change in their absorption bands with the solvent polarity (Fig. S2, ESI‡), they displayed bathochromic shifts visible to the naked eye in the emission spectra with increasing solvent polarity, indicating a strongly stabilized excited state through the surrounding solvents with remarkable charge transfer character and larger dipole moments compared to the ground state (Fig. 2). The bathochromic shifts of 93 nm for M1 and 53 nm for M2 with increasing polarity demonstrated their positive solvatochromic behavior. These differences in their shift showed that M1 has a higher charge transfer property than M2, a possible explanation of which could be the presence of an electron-withdrawing ‘CN’ group, providing M1 with a better polarizability in the D–π–A system.
 Fig. 2  Photoluminescence spectra of (a) M1 and (b) M2 in solvents having different polarities (from hexane to DMSO). 
The effect of solvent polarity on their fluorescence was illustrated through a Lippert–Mataga plot, which is a plot of Stokes shift (ΔV in cm−1) vs. orientation of polarizability (Δf) of the solvents (Fig. S3, ESI‡). The materials with a remarkable range of color emissions from bluish to orange due to the pull-push interaction in D–π–A system, almost showed similar trends of solvent polarity indicator and a positive slope, indicating a strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) with increasing Stokes shifts (Fig. S4, ESI‡). M1 tended to have more orange color compared to M2, possibly due to the effect of the CN group providing a better stability with the surrounding solvent molecules. It could also be emphasized that the difference of the CN group between two molecules provides M1 with higher values in both quantum yield and fluorescence shift, revealing that the TT part acts as an electron coupling unit as well in addition to being a π-spacer. Moreover, The Lippert–Mataga plots demonstrated a slope of 3412 cm−1 and 2691 cm−1 for M1 and M2, respectively, indicating that M1 with a CN moiety had a stronger CT character compared to M2.
Electrochemical properties
Regarding potential applications of such small molecules as organic semiconductors, their electrochemical properties are important as well as their photophysical properties. The HOMO and LUMO levels play significant roles in charge injection and charge transport of active materials in device fabrications. The electrochemical features were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in acetonitrile:dichloromethane (4:1) solution in the presence of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as an electrolyte at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1, using Pt wires as counter and working electrodes and Ag wire as a reference electrode (Fig. S5, ESI‡). On the basis of the oxidation onset potentials, the HOMO energies of M1 and M2 were calculated to be −5.58, and −5.55 eV, respectively, using the equation HOMO = −(Eonset(ox) + 4.40) (eV). Then, the LUMO values were calculated by applying the equation LUMO = HOMO+Eg (eV), where Eg is the optical band gap, determined from the absorption threshold. The LUMO energy levels of M1 and M2 were found to be −2.96, and −2.88 eV, respectively (Table 1). The effect of the additional strong electron-withdrawing boron unit was also observed with the increase of both the HOMO and LUMO levels of M1 and M2 compared to the HOMO and LUMO levels of 5a and 5b.

Electroluminescence properties
Proof-of-concept OLEDs were fabricated using a standard conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT: PSS(poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)polystyrene sulfonate)/TFB(poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-N-(4-sec-butylphenyl)-diphenylamine))/TAPC (1,1-bis[(di-4-tolylamino)phenyl]cyclohexane): TCTA(tris(4-carbazoyl-9-ylphenyl)amine): emitter (M1, M2)/TPBi (2,2′,2′′-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole))/LiF/Ca/Ag, where TFB acts as a hole transport material, TCTA/TAPC as hole transporting host materials and TPBi as an electron transport material (Fig. 3). Between the two emitters (M1 and M2), M1 exhibited the best device performance. While the OLED of M1 had a low turn-on voltage (Von) of 2.80 V, max current efficiency (CEmax) of 14.11 cd A−1 and max power efficiency (PEmax) of 7.94 lm W−1, the M2 device displayed a performance of Von = 3.0 V, CEmax = 13.24 cd A−1 and PEmax = 7.45 lm W−1 (Fig. 4, Table 2). Additionally, M1 and M2 had external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of 4.64% and 4.78%, respectively (Fig. 5a). According to the CIE color space chromaticity diagram, the devices were located at the coordinates of 0.26 and 0.55 for M1 and 0.23 and 0.49 for M2 (Fig. 5b). Thus, the values reached herein by the solution processable fabrication are higher compared to many combinations of TPA and DMB available in the literature by the mixed-host devices.10,41,49,50

The electroluminescence (EL) spectra of the M2 device exhibited an emission peak at 507 nm, while M1 showed emission at 514 nm with a red shift of 7 nm, which could be due to the presence of an electron-withdrawing CN moiety (Fig. 6a). Moreover, with two different 4-CNPh and Ph substituents on the DMB-TT-TPA core, significant changes in the fluorescence colors of M1 and M2 were observed in THF under irradiation at 365 nm, which ranged from yellowish (M1) to bluish (M2) (Fig. 6b and c). The PL spectra of the compounds were observed to be slightly red-shifted compared to the EL spectra of the films, which could be due to the microcavity effect.51–53

Computational chemistry
DFT calculations of the compounds were performed to gain more insight into their structural and electronic states.51 The gas-phase geometries were optimized by the Gaussian 09 program at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, considering that experimental results of organic materials produce good agreement with the predicted results by B3LYP.22,25,54,55 Optical properties were investigated by time dependent DFT (TD-DFT), including the solvent effect incorporated by the set of polarizable continuum model (PCM) as implemented in the Gaussian 09 package. In order to have absorption bands with the number of states (NStates) of 50,38,56 the structures and HOMO–LUMO orbitals (isosurface value 0.04 a.u.) of the compounds were visualized with Gauss View 5.0.
Based on the optimized geometries (Fig. 7), the dihedral angles between the TT plane and dimesitylboron were found to be similar, i.e. 16.5 and 15.7 for M1 and M2, respectively. Additionally, the angle between the TT and TPA moieties decreased after the addition of the boron acceptor to the compounds 5a-b due to the increasing interaction between the donor and acceptor units.
 Fig. 7  Optimized structures of 5a-b, M1 and M2 at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level in the gas phase. 
According to the molecular orbitals of M1 and M2 (Fig. 8), an intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) occurs between the donor TPA and acceptor DMB units. While in the HOMOs the electrons were located on TPA with a small part on TT, the LUMOs were localized on the electron poor boron atoms and slightly on TT, indicating the importance of TT moieties as a π-bridge between the TPA and dimesitylboron groups. Both the HOMO and LUMO were localized slightly on the TT unit, which supported the π-bridge properties of TT in the structures.39,57–60 The results of the TD-DFT method with the solvent effect (THF) are summarized in Table S2 (ESI‡). The optical properties of the compounds obtained from DFT were found to be in good agreement with the experimental results.

Thermal Properties
The thermal properties of M1 and M2 were investigated through thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) at 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere (Fig. 9). The initial mass loss (5%) around 100 °C could be due to residual water and/or the solvent. Although both materials showed high thermal stability, the substituents (–PhCN and –Ph) led to different thermal behaviors. While the highest decomposition of M1 took place at around 410 °C, it was observed around 350 °C with M2. In addition, M2 turned to ash around 500 °C. On the other hand, 20% of M1 remained without ash up to 800 °C, indicating that M1 had an excellent thermal stability compared to M2, the possible explanation of which could be that M1 had a better π–π stacking interaction between the –PhCN groups compared to M2, resulting in a higher thermal durability.26

Conclusion
In summary, two novel D–π–A fluorescence materials M1 and M2, having thieno[3,2-b]thiophenes (TTs) as π-bridges, triphenylamine (TPA) as a donor unit and dimesitylboron (DMB) as an acceptor unit were designed and synthesized through an easy-accessible synthetic method with high yields of 88 and 84%, respectively. The presence of 4-CNPh and Ph substituents at the π-bridges provided the whole system with important photophysical properties. Thanks to the strong push–pull force and charge transfer interaction, while the in-solution quantum yield was raised up to a quantitative amount, the maximum solid-state quantum yield reached 76%. Simple, low-cost and solution-processed organic light emitting devices of M1 and M2 were fabricated using them as emitters along with TFB as a hole transport material, TCTA/TAPC as hole transporting host materials, and TPBi as an electron transport material. The maximum power efficiency of 7.9 lm W−1, maximum current efficiency of 14.1 cd A−1 and maximum external quantum efficiency of 4.78% were successfully achieved with a low turn-on voltage. This work provides solution processible, cost-effective, thermally stable and highly efficient fluorescent D–π–A-type materials for display and lighting technologies.

To a solution of 5a (500 mg, 1.03 mmol) in dry THF (50 mL) was added t-butyllithium (0.75 mL, 1.7 M, 1.24 mmol) dropwise at −78 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 45 min, after which dimesitylboron fluoride (330 mg, 1.24 mmol) was added rapidly. The mixture was further stirred at −78 °C for 1 h, and then the temperature was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirring was continued overnight. The solution was extracted with dichloromethane, and the organic layer was washed with Na2CO3 solution (10%) and water. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by flash column chromatography eluting with a mixture of n-hexane/CH2Cl2 (3:1) and then crystallized from ethanol to give the title compound M1 as a yellow powder in 88% yield (665 mg). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.73 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 2H), 7.60 (s, 1H), 7.51 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 2H), 7.29 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 2H), 7.25 (s, 1H), 7.17 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 2H), 7.13 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 4H), 7.07 (t, J = 7.3 Hz, 2H), 6.94 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 2H), 6.85 (s, 3H), 6.82 (s, 1H), 6.75 (s, 1H), 2.32 (s, 6H), 2.17 (s, 12H). 13C NMR (126 MHz, CDCl3) δ 153.18, 147.65, 147.31, 145.66, 140.90, 139.28, 138.70, 138.01, 134.32, 132.25, 131.25, 131.19, 129.34, 128.20, 128.17, 127.50, 126.48, 124.64, 123.28, 122.41, 116.09, 115.92, 114.08, 23.53, 21.24.
