Structural characterizations and spectroscopic analyses of the Eu3+ probe evidenced the incorporation of rare earth emitting-centers into the precipitated GdF3 crystals among the glass matrix. In addition, the influence of phase evolution on the upconversion luminescence of Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped glass ceramics was systematically investigated and it was evidenced that the upconversion intensity of the orthorhombic GdF3 embedded glass ceramic was two orders of magnitude higher than that of the hexagonal GdF3 containing glass ceramic. Benefiting from greatly enhanced upconversion luminescence after glass crystallization, the present glass ceramic composites were demonstrated to have promising applications in optical temperature sensors as well as tunable displays.
Introduction
Currently, rare earth (RE) ion doped optical materials have attracted great interest due to their potential applications in solid-state lasers, bio-imaging, solar cells, displays, catalysis and sensors etc.1–10 Generally, the luminescence efficiency of these materials is bound up with the dynamics of RE activators which is restricted by the environments around the RE ions.11,12 Hence, it is effective to enhance RE luminescence efficiency by searching for appropriate hosts. Among a large number of materials, fluorides are known to be suitable media owing to their low phonon energy and high solubility for RE dopants. Unfortunately, the instability in chemicals and the complexity in fabrication seriously restrict their practical applications. On the other hand, oxide glasses, which have high chemical and mechanical stability, suffer from large phonon energies ascribed to the stretching vibration of network-forming oxide. To satisfy these problems, oxyfluoride glass ceramics (GC) emerged as required and received widespread attention.13–22 Such composites combine the merits of excellent mechanical strength, high chemical durability and thermal stability of oxide glasses, and low phonon energy of fluoride crystals. Oxyfluoride GC, made up with fluoride nanocrystals (NCs) embedding among an oxide glassy matrix, are generally achieved by controlled crystallization of the precursor glass with appropriate chemical compositions. And the partition of the optically active RE ions into the precipitated fluoride lattice plays an important role to improve optical performance.15
Lanthanide trifluorides (LnF3, Ln = La–Lu) with phonon energy lower than 400 cm−1, where the Ln host ions could be easily substituted by RE activators with the same valence, are very attractive media for doping RE emitting centers.23,24 Recently, the structures and optical properties of the RE doped LaF3 and YF3 NCs embedded glass ceramics have been well studied.25–29 In addition, the general nanocrystallization behaviors of the lanthanide trifluorides from LaF3 to LuF3 in the same aluminosilicate glass matrix were also reported.30 In fact, Thoma and Brunton et al. found that the LnF3 exhibited hexagonal structure at high temperature, and they undergone a rapid transition into orthorhombic one upon cooling.31 However, as far as we know, there is no investigation on the phase evolution from hexagonal to orthorhombic for RE-doped GdF3 NCs in glass ceramics and the related optical spectroscopy so far.
In this paper, hexagonal-to-orthorhombic phase evolution of GdF3 NCs in the glass matrix was realized by designing precursor glass composition with the addition of alkaline-earth/alkali-metal fluorides and controlling glass crystallization temperature. Using Eu3+ as probe ions, complete structural analyses were carried out to investigate local environment around RE activators. The influence of phase evolution on the upconversion (UC) performance of Er3+/Yb3+ codoped GC samples were systematically studied. Finally, the fabricated glass ceramics were demonstrated to have potential applications in optical thermometry as well as tunable display.
Experimental
The precursor glass (PG) compositions (in mol%) of SiO2–Al2O3–GdF3–MF2/AF (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba; A = Li, Na, K), the crystallization condition as well as the corresponding crystallization phases were tabulated in Table 1. The RE activators were introduced into glasses by addition of rare earth fluorides, such as EuF3, YbF3, ErF3, HoF3 and TmF3. For each batch, about 15 g raw materials were thoroughly mixed and melted in a covered alumina crucible at 1590 °C for 60 min to achieve a homogeneous melting, then was poured into a 300 °C preheated copper mold to cool down to room temperature. The as-prepared PGs were then cut into 5 mm2 square coupons and were crystallized by heat-treating at 550, 600, 650, 700 and 750 °C for 2 h to obtain GCs.

To identify the crystallization phase and determine the mean size of the crystallites, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out with a powder diffractometer (DMAX2500 RIGAKU) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). The microstructures of the samples were studied using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2010) equipped with the selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The samples were ground into a very fine powder that was placed onto a carbon coated copper grid and introduced into the microscope. High resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were performed to observe atomic planes inside the crystalline lattices. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) observation in the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) mode, being sensitive to the atomic number (Z) of the sample (scaling proportionally to ∼Z2),32 is carried out on an FEI aberration-corrected Titan Cubed S-Twin transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV. The emission, excitation spectra and decay curves of the Eu3+ doped PG and GC samples were recorded on an Edinburgh Instruments FS5 spectrofluorometer equipped with both continuous (150 W) and pulsed xenon lamps. UC emission spectra of the PG and GC samples were detected using the Hamamatsu R943-02 photomultiplier tube and the Spex 1000M monochromator with an adjustable laser diode (980 nm) as the excitation source. Visible UC decay curves of Er3+ in the PG and GC samples were measured with a customized UV to mid-infrared steady-state and phosphorescence lifetime spectrometer (FSP920-C, Edinburgh) equipped with a digital oscilloscope (TDS3052B, Tektronix) and a tunable mid-band OPO pulse laser as excitation source (410–2400 nm, 10 Hz, pulse width ≤ 5 ns, Vibrant 355II, OPOTEK). The corresponding lifetimes were evaluated via the equation of  because of non-single-exponential characteristics of these decay curves, where Ip is the peak intensity and I(t) is the time-related luminescence intensity. The temperature dependent Er3+ green UC emission spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh Instruments FS5 spectrofluorometer equipped with a homemade temperature controlling stage and a 980 nm laser diode.
Results and discussion
XRD patterns of the as-quenched PG (with composition of SiO2–Al2O3–GdF3–SrF2) and the GC samples obtained by heat-treated at various temperatures are shown in Fig. 1a. It exhibits a typical amorphous structure in the precursor glass, and still no sharp peaks can be observed after the heat treatment at 550 °C and 600 °C. With increase of heating temperature, several diffraction peaks corresponding to the hexagonal GdF3 appear and tend to be sharper. Since the XRD data of hexagonal GdF3 have not been reported, we indexed this phase according to the isostructural SmF3 (JCPDS no. 05-0563). Fig. 1b presents XRD patterns of glass ceramics with different SrF2 content heat-treated at 750 °C for 2 h. XRD pattern of GC750-6Sr sample is the amorphous diffuse humps like precursor glass while intense diffraction peaks can be observed when SrF2 content is increased, which indicates that lower SrF2 content goes against GdF3 crystallization. Furthermore, the impact of different alkaline-earth fluorides (MgF2, CaF2, SrF2 and BaF2) doping on glass crystallization was investigated, as exhibited in Fig. 1c. Obviously, no crystallization phase was detected for the MgF2 doped glass after heat-treatment at 750 °C for 2 h, and hexagonal GdF3 crystals precipitate from glass matrix for all the other samples. Notably, the degree of GdF3 crystallization in the CaF2 doped glass is lower than those in the SrF2 and BaF2 doped glasses.

Fig. 2a shows XRD patterns of LiF doped glass ceramics heat-treated at 600–750 °C for 2 h. Hexagonal GdF3 crystals were obtained for crystallization temperature lower than 600 °C. Further increasing temperature (650–700 °C) resulted in the formation of both hexagonal and orthorhombic GdF3 crystals, and finally all the hexagonal GdF3 crystals were converted into orthorhombic ones (JCPDS no. 49-1804) when the crystallization temperature reached as high as 750 °C. In addition, XRD patterns of diverse alkali-metal fluorides (LiF, NaF, KF) doped glass ceramics prepared by heat-treated at 750 °C for 2 h are shown in Fig. 2b. Different to the case of LiF doped GC, both hexagonal and orthorhombic GdF3 crystalline phase coexist in the NaF and KF doped GC samples obtained by heat-treating at 750 °C.

The microstructure of the glass ceramic samples was studied by electron microscopy. TEM bright field image of GC750-11Sr sample in Fig. 3a shows that nearly spherical GdF3 NCs with the size of 15–20 nm homogenously precipitated from the glass matrix. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern exhibits discrete polycrystalline diffraction rings, confirming the formation of hexagonal GdF3 particles after crystallization. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image for an individual GdF3 NC (Fig. 3b) verifies its single-crystalline nature with high-crystallinity. The lattice fringes are clearly resolved, and a typical d-spacing around 3.1 Å is observed, corresponding to the (111) plane of hexagonal GdF3 phase. Similarly, TEM image and SAED pattern of the GC750-Li sample (Fig. 4a) evidence that orthorhombic GdF3 nanoparticles with the size of 40–50 nm monodispersely distributed among glass matrix. HRTEM observation on an individual orthorhombic GdF3 particle demonstrates its high crystallinity and well-resolved (210) lattice plane (Fig. 4b).

Furthermore, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) operated in the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) mode, which is sensitive to the atomic number (Z) of the sample (scaling proportionally to ∼Z2),32 is adopted to investigate the microstructures of GC samples. Note that for STEM-HAADF images, contrary to previous TEM ones, the particles appear with a brighter contrast than the aluminosilicate glass matrix (Fig. 3c and 4c) due to the much larger atomic number of Gd (Z = 64) segregated in the GdF3 particles than those of Si/Al (Z = 14/13) distributed in the glass matrix. The F, Gd, Yb and Er STEM elemental mappings for the GC750-11Sr (Fig. 3d–g) and GC750-Li (Fig. 4d–g) samples reveal the localization of Gd, Yb and Er in the GdF3 NCs, whereas the equal presence of F in the particles and the glass matrix. These results indicate the incorporation of Yb3+ and Er3+ activators into GdF3 crystalline lattice.
In the SiO2–Al2O3–GdF3–MF2/AF (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba; A = Li, Na, K) glasses, the glass network can be considered to consist of [SiO4] and [AlO4] tetrahedral, and the network modifying ions, such as Li+, Sr2+ and Gd3+, are located in the interstices of the glass framework.33 The occurrence of crystallization of the specific phase in the glass is determined by the interactions among the ions of the glass components. The ionicity of the M–O or A–O bond is greater than that of the Gd–O one,34 thus the affinity of M2+ and A+ to O2− is stronger than that of Gd3+ in the aluminosilicate network. The ionicity of the bonds of the glass components with F− increases in the sequence of Si–F < Al–F < Gd–F < M–F < A–F.34 As M2+ and A+ ions tightly bond with O2−, Gd3+ is therefore the next element having the highest affinity to F−. This makes the GdF3 crystallization in the interstices of the aluminosilicate framework possible. Compared with the orthorhombic one, the hexagonal phase requires smaller interstitial space owing to its dense-packing structure. As a result, in the alkaline-earth (especially Sr2+ and Ba2+ with large ionic radii) doped glasses, i.e., hexagonal GdF3 particles are easier to precipitate from glass matrix, while in the alkali-metal (especially Li+ with small ionic radii) doped glasses, the interstitial spaces of the glass framework tend to be able to accommodate the nucleation and growth of orthorhombic GdF3 particles.
To discern the surroundings of RE activators in GC samples, room temperature excitation and emission spectra of Eu3+, acting as a structural probe, in both hexagonal GdF3 embedded GC and orthorhombic GdF3 contained GC, are recorded, as presented in Fig. 5 and 6. Two sets of excitation signals can be detected in the excitation spectra according to Fig. 5a and 6a by monitoring 592 nm (Eu3+: 5D0 → 7F1) emission: one consists of several characteristic Eu3+ excitation peaks from the 7F0 ground-state to the indexed excited-states, and the other consists of two excitation bands at 272 nm (Gd3+: 8S7/2 → 6IJ) and 310 nm (Gd3+: 8S7/2 → 6PJ) respectively, which demonstrates the existence of energy transfer from Gd3+ to Eu3+. Impressively, the dominant peak for Eu3+: 7F0 → 5L6 excitation band locates in 393 nm for PG while it converts into 396 nm for hexagonal GdF3 embedded GC (GC750-Sr, Fig. 5a), indicating the modification of Eu3+ crystal-field environment. In the emission spectra (Fig. 5b), typical Eu3+ emission lines of 4f–4f transitions from the excited states to the lower ones, i.e., 5D3,2,1 → 7FJ and 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 0–4) are observed. Compared to PG (393 nm excitation), the spectrum of GC750-Sr (396 nm excitation) significantly changes, i.e., the emission bands become Stark-splitting and narrowed, the 5D3,2,1 → 7FJ emission intensities greatly enhance, and the ratio of 5D0 → 7F2 electric dipolar transition to 5D0 → 7F2 magnetic dipolar one greatly decreases. All these results evidence the alternation of Eu3+ environment from amorphous glass to hexagonal GdF3 crystals with high crystal-field symmetry and low phonon energy (<400 cm−1) after crystallization treatment.24 Considering the approximate ionic radius between Eu3+ and Gd3+, Eu3+ activator is believed to substitute Gd3+ site in the GdF3 host. Notably, the emission spectrum of GC750-Sr obtained under 393 nm excitation is quite different to that under 396 nm excitation (Fig. 5b), suggesting that there are still some residual Eu3+ ions staying in glass matrix after crystallization. As for LiF-doped GCs, significantly spectral changes are found when hexagonal GdF3 phase is transformed into orthorhombic one with increase of crystallization temperature (Fig. 6b). The crystal-like emission spectrum of Eu3+ in GC750-Li under indirect excitation of Gd3+ (272 nm) confirmed the incorporation of Eu3+ in orthorhombic GdF3 crystal lattice. Finally, the experimental decay lifetimes for the Eu3+ excited states provides important information to evaluate the environments of the Eu3+ ions. Fig. 7 shows the fluorescence decay curves of the 5D0 level for the PG and GC samples by detecting 592 nm emission (Eu3+: 5D0 → 7F1 transition). Apparently, the obtained lifetime increases obviously after glass crystallization owing to the partition of Eu3+ ions into the hexagonal/orthorhombic GdF3 crystals with low-phonon-energy.

In the further experiment, the influence of the glass crystallization on the UC optical performance of the Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped PG and GC samples with the addition of alkaline-earth/alkali-metal ions is investigated, as shown in Fig. 8. Under 980 nm near-infrared (NIR) laser excitation, both green (2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2) and red (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) UC emissions of Er3+ appear in the emission spectra of all the PG and GC samples. In comparison to PG, significant enhancement of the UC intensity after glass crystallization (Fig. 8a and c) certifies the preferential partition of the optically active centers into the precipitated GdF3 crystalline phase, which greatly reduces non-radiative relaxation probabilities of Er3+ owing to the low-phonon-energy crystalline environments. For example, the UC intensities of GC750-16Sr and GC750-Li GC samples are about 40 and 1000 times as high as those of the corresponding PGs. As revealed in the inset of Fig. 8a, as crystallization temperature is elevated, UC intensity gradually increases and red to green emission intensity ratio monotonously decreases, attributing to the improved crystallinity and increased size of hexagonal GdF3 NCs. Generally, the greater non-radiative multi-phonon relaxation probabilities from the Er3+: 2H11/2/4S3/2 and 4F9/2 states to the lower ones in GC sample with smaller NCs can be expected as they have a high surface-to-volume ratio and therefore a larger proportion of Er3+ emitting-centers are located on the NC surfaces and under the influence of high energy vibrations of aluminosilicate glass groups.35,36

(e) Comparison of UC emission spectra between GC750-11Sr sample and GC750-Li one. Insets of (e) show the corresponding UC luminescent photographs of GC samples. 
The impact of diverse alkaline-earth and alkali-metal dopants on UC performance of GC samples has also been investigated. As shown in Fig. 8b, the UC emission intensities of GC750-11Ba and GC750-11Sr samples are far higher than those of GC750-11Ca and GC750-11Mg ones, owing to the formation of a large amount of hexagonal Yb/Er: GdF3 NCs in the former two GC samples. For the LiF doped GC samples (Fig. 8c), it can be observed that the UC emission spectra of GC700-Li and GC750-Li samples are completely different to those of GC600-Li and GC650-Li ones, confirming the formation of different phases, i.e., orthorhombic GdF3 and hexagonal GdF3, respectively. Clearly, with the conversion from hexagonal to orthorhombic, UC emission intensity is greatly intensified for all the LiF, NaF and KF doped GC samples (Fig. 8c and d). The comparison of UC emission spectra between GC750-Li and GC750-11Sr under the identical measuring condition (Fig. 8e) evidenced that the intensity of the former with orthorhombic GdF3 embedded in glass matrix has two orders of magnitude (about 400 times) higher than that of the latter with hexagonal GdF3 embedded in glass matrix. Notably, such enhanced luminescence should be attributed to the combined effects of different phase structures as well as crystal sizes.
Time-resolved decay behaviors were investigated to reveal the influence of structural variation of GC on UC luminescence. All the lifetime values are evaluated and tabulated in Table 2. For SrF2 doped GC samples, the trend of lifetime variation is consistent with that of UC intensity variation: the lifetimes for the Er3+: 2H11/2, 4S3/2 green-emitting states and Er3+: 4F9/2 red-emitting one become longer with increase of crystallization temperature, as exhibited in Fig. 9a and b. For LiF doped GC samples, the lifetimes have the same trend as the SrF2 doped samples when temperature is not exceeding 650 °C. However, up to 700 °C, the lifetimes of samples become shorter with increase of crystallization temperature (Fig. 9c and d, Table 2). Such decay behavior is believed to attribute to the phase transition from hexagonal GdF3 to orthorhombic one with increase of temperature. As demonstrated in the insets of Fig. 9c and d, the lifetimes of both green and red emitting states in the GC750-Li GC embedded with orthorhombic GdF3 NCs are lower than those in the GC750-11Sr GC embedded with hexagonal GdF3 NCs even though the UC intensity of the former GC is far higher than that of the latter one. It was well-known that the UC luminescence was highly dependent on the crystal phase structure, size and morphology. In our samples, the sizes (40–50 nm) of orthorhombic GdF3 spherical NCs in GC750-Li are larger than those (15–20 nm) of hexagonal GdF3 spherical NCs in GC750-Sr sample. Therefore, the shorten lifetime in GC750-Li should be due to the hexagonal-to-orthorhombic phase transition of GdF3 in glass matrix.

The crystal structures of hexagonal and orthorhombic GdF3 are schematically illustrated in Fig. 10. In orthorhombic GdF3 crystal, Gd3+ ion locates in the center of an irregular trigonal prism with six F− ions at the corners and other three F− ions are symmetrically disposed in front of the prism (Fig. 10a); hence, the coordination number (CN) of F− around Gd3+ is nine.37 On the other hand, in the hexagonal GdF3 crystal, there are extra two F− ions disposed up and down the prism,37 and thus the CN of F− around Gd3+ becomes eleven (Fig. 10b). Notably, the shorter Gd3+–Gd3+ ionic distance (3.593 Å) in orthorhombic GdF3 than that (4.036 Å) in hexagonal GdF3 will be beneficial for efficient energy transfer among RE (Yb/Er) activators, which results in intense UC luminescence in the orthorhombic GdF3 embedded GC.

The ability of controllable crystallization with the incorporation of RE activators into precipitated fluorides enables new research opportunities for the applications of the prepared GCs. Here, these GCs are demonstrated to have potential application in optical temperature sensors. As shown in Fig. 11, temperature-dependent UC emission spectra in the temperature range of 293–563 K were recorded. Importantly, the relative intensity of the two green emission bands of Er3+ around 521 nm (2H11/2 → 4I15/2) and 542 nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) exhibits remarkable temperature dependence (Fig. 11a and b), owing to the thermal coupling competition between 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 states of Er3+. The fluorescent intensity ratio (FIR) of these two UC emissions can be expressed by the equation38 
(1)where I521 and I542 are the integrated UC emission intensities corresponding to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, respectively, C is the constant, ΔE is the energy gap between 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 states, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. According to eqn (1), monolog plot of FIR versus inverse absolute temperature for the GC750-11Sr and GC750-Li samples are provided in Fig. 11c and d, respectively. The slopes are fitted to be 1133 and 1065, respectively. As a consequence, the corresponding energy gaps (ΔE) for GC750-11Sr and GC750-Li samples are determined to be about 788 and 741 cm−1, respectively. Furthermore, the temperature sensor sensitivity was calculated according to the equation

Monolog plots of FIR as a function of inverse absolute temperature for (c) GC750-11Sr and (d) GC750-Li samples. Dependence of sensor sensitivity of (e) GC750-11Sr and (f) GC750-Li samples on temperature. 
According to eqn (2), the maximal sensitivity can reach 0.33% K−1 at 568 K for the GC750-11Sr sample and 0.25% K−1 at 533 K for the GC750-Li sample, respectively (Fig. 11e and f). The sensitivities of GCs are comparable to previously reported values in silicate glasses (∼0.31% K−1) and fluoride micro-/nano-crystals (∼0.40% K−1).39–44 Importantly, the present GCs show improved UC performance relative to silicate glasses due to the partition of Yb3+/Er3+ activators into GdF3 crystalline lattice with low phonon energy, and exhibited better stability than pure fluorides owing to the protecting role of the inorganic aluminosilicate glass matrix. Therefore, benefited from its greatly enhanced UC luminescence, the present GC embedded with orthorhombic GdF3 NCs (Yb/Er doped GC750-Li sample) is expected to be a very promising candidate for accurate optical temperature sensing.
On the other hand, color-tunable UC luminescence can be realized by doping appropriate RE emitting centers into GCs. Fig. 12a shows the UC emission spectra of the Yb/Tm/Ho triply doped GC750-Li samples under the excitation of 980 nm laser. The blue (Tm3+ 1G4 → 3H6), green (Ho3+ 4S2, 5F4 → 5I8) and red (Ho3+ 5F5 → 5I8; Tm3+ 1G4 → 3F4) emissions are simultaneously generated. By modifying Ho3+content, the relative intensity of blue, green and red luminescence is adjustable. As demonstrated in the Commission International de I'Eclairage (CIE) 1931 chromaticity diagram (Fig. 12b), the UC luminescent color can be tuned from blue to cyan and finally to green and is clearly visible by the naked eyes (insets of Fig. 12b). In addition, pumping-power-dependent UC emission spectra of Yb/Ho and Yb/Tm doped GC samples (not provided here) evidence nearly quadratic and cubic dependence for Ho3+ green and Tm3+ blue UC luminescence, respectively. These results suggest that the electron populations in the 5S2, 5F4 states of Ho3+ and 1G4 one of Tm3+ are two-photon and three-photon UC processes, respectively. As a result, the impact of pumping power on Tm3+ 1G4 → 3H6 (blue) and 1G4 → 3F4 (red) transitions will be more significant than Ho3+ 5S2, 5F4 → 5I8 (green) and 5F5 → 5I8 (red) ones. Hence, the color of UC luminescence for GC sample is expected to finely optimize via modifying the 980 nm laser pumping power, as shown in Fig. 12c. The enhancement of both blue and red UC emissions is faster than that of green one when pumping power of 980 nm laser gradually intensifies (right of Fig. 12c). Excitation-power-dependent variation of color coordinates in CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram clearly verifies the shifting of UC emission color towards cyan region with increase of laser pumping power (left of Fig. 12c).

Conclusions
Hexagonal and orthorhombic GdF3 NCs embedded glass ceramics were successfully prepared by melt-quenching and subsequent glass crystallization. It was found that both crystallization temperature and alkaline-earth/alkali-metal dopants played a key role on the phase evolution of the precipitated GdF3 among glass matrix. Particularly, the addition of alkaline-earth fluorides such as SrF2 and BaF2 was beneficial to the crystallization of hexagonal GdF3 while the introduction of alkali-metal fluorides such as LiF induced the formation of pure orthorhombic GdF3 in the glass matrix. Elemental mapping in the scanning transmission electron microscope and optical spectroscopy analysis confirmed the partition of the active centers into the GdF3 crystalline lattice. As a result, greatly enhanced Er3+ UC luminescence was observed after glass crystallization, ascribing to modification of Yb3+/Er3+ surrounding from amorphous aluminosilicate glass matrix to GdF3 crystalline lattice with low phonon energy and high crystallinity. Moreover, the UC luminescence of the orthorhombic GdF3 embedded glass ceramic was found to be about 400 times as high as that of the hexagonal GdF3 embedded glass ceramic, relating to the combined effects of different phase structures and crystal sizes. Subsequently, rare earth doped glass ceramic containing orthorhombic GdF3 was demonstrated to be a promising material for accurate temperature sensing as well as color tunable emitting.
