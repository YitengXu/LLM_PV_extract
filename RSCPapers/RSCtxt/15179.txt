    , Accepted 23rd April 2018First published on 23rd April 2018Abstractn-Type doping has been widely employed to enhance the performance of a photoanode in a photoelectrochemical cell used for water splitting. However, little is known about how doping affects the catalytic activity during surface catalysis. Herein, we took BiVO4 as an example to investigate the effect of doping on surface catalysis from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. To enable an impartial comparison, we have prepared planar BiVO4 thin films with and without W doping. It was found that W doping had no obvious effect on the morphology, crystallinity, and light absorption of the film; however, the photocurrent was significantly enhanced upon W doping. This enhancement is contributed by two important factors: better charge separation efficiency and improved surface charge transfer efficiency. Electrochemical analysis reveals that W doping lowers the surface charge transfer resistance and forms active surface states, facilitating charge transfer. Theoretical analysis shows that W doping activates the V atoms to be reactive sites. Moreover, the adsorption energies and distance between adsorption species (OHads, Oads, and OOHads) involved in the water splitting process become more favorable for surface charge transfer. The current study provides an insight into the roles of W doping in BiVO4, especially during surface catalysis.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising route to generate hydrogen fuel to solve energy and environmental issues by converting and storing intermittent and inexhaustible solar energy into chemical bonds.1–3 Compared with the case of photocathode semiconductors used for hydrogen evolution, the low efficiency of the photoanode towards the oxygen evolution reaction poses a greater challenge to achieve a highly efficient overall water splitting.4 As a result, significant attention has been paid towards improving the performance of the photoanode. Monoclinic scheelite bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has recently been identified as one of the most promising photoanode materials for PEC water splitting.2,5–17 The theoretical solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency is about 9.1% with a band gap of 2.4 eV. Moreover, this material has favorable band edge positions, with the conduction band minimum close to the H2O reduction potential and the valence band maximum at a more positive potential as compared to the H2O oxidation potential. As a result, it shows a good onset potential for water oxidation among most visible-light responsive photoanodes.
The solar energy conversion efficiency of BiVO4 for water splitting is determined by 3 factors: solar light absorption efficiency, charge separation efficiency in the bulk of the photoelectrode, and interfacial charge transfer efficiency at the electrode/electrolyte junction. The light absorption efficiency is affected by 2 factors: the band gap of the semiconductor material and the interaction of the semiconductor material with incoming photons. The second factor depends on the surface nanostructures and thickness and can be controlled by tuning these to enhance the light absorption. After the capture of light, electrons and holes are generated, and ideally, the charges are separated towards the cathode and anode. The charge separation efficiency determines how many photo-generated carriers are successfully transported to the surfaces of electrodes. Finally, the carriers that reach the surface will either react with water to generate O2 and H2 or recombine to generate heat. It is difficult to change the band gap of BiVO4; therefore, enhancing the charge separation and avoiding surface recombination are feasible solutions. To avoid recombination on the electrode surface, the surface states play a very important role.18 In the past, many studies have been devoted to the use of co-catalysts (or electrocatalysts) to suppress the recombination, and significant progress has been achieved.11,19–21 For charge separation, it is well understood that it is affected by several factors including lattice scattering, defects trapping, and grain boundary recombination. Usually, for a photoanode such as BiVO4, poor electron conductivity is a critical factor, which limits charge transport. Doping has been widely employed to improve the performance of photoanodes. For example, W or Mo doping is normally used to improve the conductivity of BiVO4 photoanodes.6,8,11,13,15,22 The most accepted reason for the observed enhancement is the improved electron conductivity caused by n-type doping to increase the electron density of BiVO4. However, surface issues, such as surface states, are also an important area to consider as abovementioned. Doping can also potentially cause a change in the surface conditions, and this has not received significant attention to date. Therefore, a comprehensive approach is needed to investigate both the bulk charge separation and surface charge transport with a particular focus on how the surface chemistry is changed due to doping.
In this study, we have fabricated BiVO4 thin films with or without W doping using a drop-casting method reported in a previous study.23 We used a planar dense structure in this study to minimize the interference caused by the nanostructures on the light absorption; this enabled us to focus on the mechanisms behind the doping effect. The effect of W doping on BiVO4 was discussed from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. It was found that W doping changed the active sites and adsorption of water on the surface of BiVO4; this greatly enhanced the surface charge transfer.
2. Methods and characterization
2.1 Preparation of the W-doped BiVO4 thin films
Pristine and W-doped BiVO4 thin films were fabricated using the drop-casting method reported earlier.23 Bismuth trioxide, ammonium metavanadate, and ammonium tungstate hydrate were dissolved in ethylene glycol with an appropriate amount of nitric acid to form 0.1 M Bi, V, and W aqueous precursor solutions, respectively. The solutions were mixed well according to the stoichiometric ratio of Bi:V = 1:1 for pristine BiVO4 (PBVO) and Bi:V:W = 100:97:3 for W-doped BiVO4 (WBVO). The corresponding volume ratio is 500 μl:500 μl for PBVO and 500 μl:485 μl:15 μl for WBVO. Citric acid (CA) was added according to the stoichiometric ratio of CA:M = 1.5:1 (where M is the total amount of cation). The mixture was then added to 2 ml of ethylene glycol. After mixing, 60 μl of the precursor solution was drop cast onto an exposed half side of a 1 cm × 2 cm FTO substrate with the other half covered with a thermal tape. The samples were then dried at 120 °C for 30 min to obtain the gel films. After peeling off the covered thermal tape, the samples were subsequently placed in a furnace for heat treatment at 500 °C for 2 h in air. The ramping rate was set at 10 °C min−1.
2.2 Characterization
The crystallinity of the PBVO and WBVO thin films was identified using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu 6000 X-ray diffractometer) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). The morphologies of PBVO and WBVO thin films were observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM-7600F). The light absorption efficiency of the PBVO and WBVO thin films was determined based on the reflectance and transmittance spectra obtained using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, Perkin-Elmer) with an integrating sphere. The chemical state of W was investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Omicron EA125). The binding energy was calibrated by C1s (284.6 eV). PEC measurements of the PBVO and WBVO thin films were carried out using a three-electrode configuration (PCI4/300™ potentiostat with PHE200™ software, Gamry Electronic Instruments, Inc) with the PBVO or WBVO thin films as the working electrodes, Pt mesh as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. A solar simulator (HAL-320, Asahi Spectra Co., Ltd) with a power intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated using a solar reference cell was used as the light source for the PEC measurements. The photocurrent for water oxidation was measured in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution at a scan rate of 30 mV s−1. The photocurrent was also measured in the presence of a hole scavenger using a 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution mixed with 0.1 M Na2SO3 to evaluate the charge separation efficiency and charge transfer efficiency. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out under AM 1.5G solar simulator illumination in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte at an applied potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE using an AUTOLAB Potentiostat–Galvanostat (AUTOLAB PGSTAT302 N). The Mott–Schottky plot was made using the same AUTOLAB Potentiostat–Galvanostat at a fixed frequency of 1 kHz in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution in the dark.
2.3 Calculation methods
The CASTEP module of the Materials Studio software (Accelrys Inc) was employed for the quantum chemistry calculations. During the calculations, the 2 × 1 × 2 BiVO4 (space group 15) structure with the crystallographic parameters of 14.602 Å × 11.704 Å × 10.290 Å was used for the bulk property calculations. For the doped case, one V atom was replaced by a W atom to represent W-doped BiVO4. A 2 × 2 supercell of W-doped BiVO4(010) surface with a vacuum region of 15 Å was used to investigate the surface properties. The (010) surface was used because it was the most stable surface under realistic conditions.13,24,25 During the calculations, self-consistent periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) approximation was used to calculate the exchange–correlation energy. The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) scheme was chosen as the minimization algorithm. A DFT-D correction was applied during the dispersion corrections. Hubbard U-corrections to the d electrons of V (LDA+U, effective U(V) = 2.5 eV) and spin-polarization were performed during the calculations. Ultrasoft pseudopotentials in the reciprocal space were used, where the electron configuration of the valence was set as O-2s22p4, Ti-3s23p63d24s2, V-3p63d34s2, W-5p65d46s2, and Bi-5d106s26p3. Gaussian smearing scheme with a smearing width of 0.05 eV and 30% empty band was applied in the calculations. The external stress and hydrostatic pressure were set at 0 GPa. The energy cut-off was set at 380 eV, and the SCF tolerance was 1.0 × 10−6 eV per atom. The convergence criteria for structure optimization and energy calculations were set to an energy tolerance of 5.0 × 10−6 eV per atom, a maximum force tolerance of 0.01 eV Å−1, 0.02 GPa, and a maximum displacement tolerance of 5.0 × 10−4 Å. A 2 × 2 × 3 k-point sampling was used for the bulk, and 2 × 1 × 1 was used for the surface calculations. The Fermi level was simply defined as the valence band maximum (VBM) for n-type semiconductors and insulators in the CASTEP code and some other codes.26,27 Further calculation details are given in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Experimental results

Fig. 1a and b illustrate the morphologies of PBVO and WBVO. Both samples display a very similar surface morphology of a dense film with small particle nodules. The film thickness is 162 nm and 154 nm for PBVO and WBVO, respectively (insets in Fig. 1a and b). The X-ray diffraction data (Fig. 1c) show that all the peaks of PBVO and WBVO thin films agree well with those of BiVO4 (PDF#14-0688), and no peaks belonging to other phases are present except those from the substrate FTO (SnO2). These results demonstrate that W doping causes no obvious changes in the morphology and crystallinity of BiVO4. The chemical states of W were investigated using XPS, and the W 4d spectra are shown in Fig. 1d. Compared with the case of PBVO, two peaks from W 4d are observed for WBVO, which indicate that W has been successfully incorporated into BiVO4. The W content was ∼1.8 wt% or 0.58 at% based on the EDX estimation (Table S1, ESI†). The corresponding W doping level was W:Bi = 3.1:100, close to the experimental ratio of 3:100.

Fig. 2 shows the photocurrents observed for the PBVO and WBVO thin films from front- (from the liquid/sample side) and back-side (from the substrate/sample side) illumination. For the front-side illumination, the photo-excited carriers are mostly generated near the liquid/sample interface region. Thus, under illumination from the front side, the electron has to travel through a relatively long way to reach the conductive substrate, whereas the hole travels a short distance to reach the liquid; on the contrary, under back-side illumination, the photo-excited carriers are mostly generated near the FTO-BiVO4 interface region. Thus, under illumination from the back side, the hole has to travel a relatively long path to the liquid, whereas the electron will travel a relatively short distance to the conductive substrate. Hence, a comparison of the photocurrents generated from front- and back-side illumination can reflect the relative transport properties of the electrons and holes. Fig. 2a shows that the back-side illumination photocurrent is higher than the front-side illumination photocurrent; this indicates the poor electron transport properties of PBVO. However, for the W-doped sample, the front-side illumination photocurrent was higher than the back-side illumination photocurrent (Fig. 2b); this indicated much better electron transport in WBVO. Based on these observations, W doping greatly enhanced the photocurrent (Fig. 2c), and this improvement was attributed to the much improved electron transport upon increasing the electron density through W doping. The photocurrent of PBVO at 1.23 V vs. RHE was around 0.18 mA cm−2, whereas that of WBVO was increased by ∼300% to 0.74 mA cm−2. To confirm that the enhanced performance is contributed by the improved electron conductivity, Mott–Schottky plots of PBVO and WBVO (Fig. 2d) have been obtained to calculate the carrier density. The majority carrier (electron) density was estimated by (1)where A is the electrode area (1 cm2 in this study), e0 is the electron charge (1.60 × 10−19 C), ε is the dielectric constant of BiVO4 (68), ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), Nd is the donor density, and V is the potential applied at the electrode. The slope of WBVO was lower than that of PBVO; this indicated higher carrier density of WBVO. The estimated electron density of PBVO was 2.9 × 1020 cm−3 according to eqn (1), and this relatively high level was due to the n-type nature of PBVO. After doping, the electron density of WBVO increased to 5.8 × 1020 cm−3. The net increase in density, 2.9 × 1020 cm−3, agrees reasonably well with the expected increase 3.7 × 1020 cm−3 if 3% of the V atoms are replaced by W.

The electron density mainly affects the bulk film properties; the photocurrent performance is also affected by the properties of the photoanode surface. To gain a clear understanding of the observed enhancement, the light absorption efficiency, charge separation efficiency in the bulk of the film, and interfacial charge transfer efficiency were determined and analyzed.
The water oxidation photocurrent JH2O is contributed by the light absorption efficiency (ηabs), charge separation efficiency in the bulk of the film (ηsep), and interfacial charge transfer efficiency (ηtran):28 JH2O = J0 × ηabs × ηsep × ηtran = Jabs × ηsep × ηtran(2)where J0 is the theoretical solar photocurrent, which speculates that all the solar energy corresponding to the band edge can be fully converted to fuel energy (7.3 mA cm−2 for BiVO4).9 To quantitatively analyze this contribution, an effective hole scavenger, Na2SO3, was utilized to suppress the surface charge recombination due to slow oxidation kinetics. In the presence of the hole scavenger Na2SO3, the charge transfer efficiency can be approximated to be 100% (ηinj = 1) due to the fast oxidation kinetics of Na2SO3.28 Under this approximation, the Na2SO3 oxidation photocurrent is determined by28 JNa2SO3 = J0 × ηabs × ηsep = Jabs × ηsep(3)where JNa2SO3 is the oxidation photocurrent obtained using Na2SO3. From eqn (2) and (3), we can obtain the charge separation efficiency ηsep = JNa2SO3/Jabs and the charge transfer efficiency ηtran = JH2O/JNa2SO3. To begin the quantitative analysis, the light absorption efficiencies of PBVO and WBVO have to be measured. As shown in Fig. 3a, there was not much difference between the light absorption efficiencies observed for PBVO and WBVO. According to the light absorption efficiencies, Jabs was calculated to be 4.01 mA cm−2 and 4.07 mA cm−2 for PBVO and WBVO, respectively. In addition, the Na2SO3 oxidation photocurrent was measured, as shown in Fig. 3b.
 Fig. 3  The (a) light absorption efficiency, (b) oxidation photocurrent in the electrolyte in the presence of a hole scavenger Na2SO3, (c) charge separation efficiency, and (d) charge transfer efficiency of PBVO and WBVO. 
The calculated charge separation efficiency of PBVO was about 12% at 1.23 V vs. RHE, whereas that of WBVO was about 30% (Fig. 3c). The charge transfer efficiency of PBVO was about 34% at 1.23 V vs. RHE and that of WBVO was about 60% (Fig. 3d). As a result, the observed enhancement in the photocurrent was contributed by both the increased charge separation and charge transfer. The enhanced bulk charge separation originated from the enhanced electron density as abovementioned. However, further analysis is needed to understand how W doping affects the surface charge transfer.
To unravel the root cause of the enhanced surface charge transfer efficiency observed upon W doping, EIS was performed. To reflect the actual surface reactions that are occurring during water oxidation, EIS has been performed under solar illumination. Fig. 4a shows the Nyquist plots, in which the radius of the semicircle for the sample PBVO is larger than that for WBVO; this indicates the larger surface resistance of PBVO. According to a previous study, an equivalent circuit was employed to analyze the surface charge transfer (inset in Fig. 4a).29 In the equivalent circuit, Rs represents the resistances of the FTO film, the external electrical contacts, and the liquid electrolyte, C is the bulk capacitance, and Rct (charge transfer resistance) represents the resistance of charge transfer at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. The fitting results show that the Rs values are around 35 Ω for both PBVO and WBVO. The surface charge transfer resistance Rct of PBVO is about 6945 Ω, whereas that of WBVO is much smaller at around 1041 Ω. This result indicates that W doping can lower the surface charge transfer resistance; this is consistent with the observed charge transfer efficiency enhancement. To unravel how W doping affects the charge transfer, the surface condition in BiVO4 is critical.

The inset in (a) shows the equivalent circuit used to simulate the EIS. Rbulk represents the total resistance from the external circuit; C is the bulk capacitance; Rct is charge transfer resistance of holes from PBVO or WBVO surface to water. (b) The cyclic voltammetry scan of PBVO and WBVO performed in the dark at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 after holding the electrode at a potential of 1.8 V vs. RHE for 120 s under 1 sun illumination. 
It is known that hydroxy-terminated surface states will be formed on the metal oxide electrode surface in an aqueous solution.30–32 According to a previous study, the surface states will be charged by holes prior to the water oxidation step.33 These active surface states can be characterized by a reduction cyclic voltammetry scan, in which current peaks can be revealed due to the reduction of the charged surface species.33 In this study, we employed this technique to investigate the surface condition upon W doping. As shown in Fig. 4b, we carried out a cyclic voltammetry scan of BiVO4 in a Na2SO4 electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 after holding the electrode at a potential of 1.8 V vs. RHE for 120 s under 1 sun illumination. It is found that for PBVO, no obvious reduction peak is observed, whereas one obvious reduction peak around 0.7 V vs. RHE is observed for WBVO. It was thus concluded that W doping introduced an active surface state that participated in the water oxidation step. This observation also explains why W-doped BiVO4 has a lower charge transfer resistance, which contributes to the higher transfer efficiency.
3.2 Theoretical calculations
The 2 × 1 × 2 supercell models of PBVO and WBVO are shown in Fig. 5a. Monoclinic BiVO4 is composed of a layered structure along the crystallographic c-axis (Fig. 5a), in which two polyhedra units, VO4 tetrahedra and BiO8 dodecahedra, are linked to each other by edge sharing.25 In WBVO, the doping element W substitutes V and is displayed in blue color (Fig. 5a). Considering the possibility of interstitial substitution, the defect formation energy was calculated (Table S2, ESI†) for the two different interstitial sites (Fig. S2, ESI†).34 The formation energy shows that interstitial W is unlikely to occur due to its high formation energy. Thus, herein, we only calculated the defect formation energy of W replacing V. As seen from Fig. 5a, the substitution of V causes a slight deformation in the structure. The bond length of Bi–O (no. 1–5) shows a small decrease, whereas that of Bi–O (no. 6–8) shows a slight increase. However, there was not much difference in the V–O bond length. The bond length of W–O is generally slightly larger than that of the substituted V–O; this is mainly due to the larger ionic radius of W (0.6 Å) than that of V (0.54 Å). Fig. 5b shows the DOS of PBVO and WBVO. The valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) are mainly composed of the O 2p and V 3d states. The Bi 6p and Bi 6s states also contribute to the composition of the VB and CB. Compared with the case of PBVO, one feature in the case of WBVO is the formation of a localized filled state inside the band gap that is composed of the O 2p and V 3d states. This type of localized state usually serves as a recombination center. The finding of the localized state helps explain the reported performance increase at a small doping concentration that then decreases at a higher doping concentration.35 The localized state assists charge separation by increasing the majority charge carrier concentration on the one hand and promoting charge recombination on the other hand. Therefore, an optimized doping concentration is critical to achieve a balance between charge concentration and charge recombination.
 Fig. 5  (a) The crystal structure of PBVO and WBVO. The Bi, V, O, and W atoms are represented by purple, grey, red, and blue colours. (b) The density of states (DOS) of PBVO and WBVO. 
The optimized PBVO and WBVO(010) facets are shown in Fig. 6a. As seen from Fig. 6a and b, the substitution of V by W causes some deformation around the substitution sites, around which the well-overlapped O atoms (red spheres) in PBVO are now separated and can be distinguished in WBVO. The bond length was also changed. From the PDOS of the PBVO and WBVO(010) facets (Fig. 6b), a filled state inside the band gap was observed, which was contributed by the V 3d and O 2p orbitals. The spin-up (y > 0) and spin-down (y < 0) DOS are the same for PBVO. However, for WBVO, there is a substantial difference between the spin-up and spin-down PDOS. The symmetry of the spin-up and spin-down PDOS is related to the polarization of the spin moment of the transition metal (V atom).36 The un-symmetrical spin state (polarized state) PDOS inside the band gap suggests the absence of surface V atoms in a certain spin direction, and this surface termination influences the adjacent O atoms to become polarized too.36 Thus, the observed filled state inside the band gap was mainly composed of V 3d and O 2p orbitals. In the experiment (Fig. 4b), an active surface state was observed. By combining the abovementioned findings with the theoretical analysis results, it was found that the observed active surface state was likely to be a surface V site since the charge distribution on the surface V sites and a surface filled state (from PDOS) was also contributed by the V 3d orbitals. The spin density map of W-doped BiVO4 shows the localization of an electron on V (Fig. S1, ESI†).

Fig. 7 displays the adsorption of several key species involved in water oxidation on the BiVO4(010) facet with and without W doping. The adsorption energies of OHads on the Bi and V atoms of the (010) facet of WBVO are much smaller (0.5–0.51 eV) than those of PBVO (2.1–2.29 eV). In addition, the adsorption energy of OHads on the substitution site (W atom) has a similar value as that on V. This indicates that W doping greatly favors the adsorption of OHads. For Oads, the adsorption energy on the Bi atom of WBVO decreases, whereas the adsorption energy on the V atom shows a slight increase. However, the substitution site W shows decreased adsorption energy. Thus, W doping shows a favorable adsorption of Oads on the Bi and W atom sites. For OOHads, the adsorption energy on the Bi and V atoms of WBVO also decreases; this indicates the better adsorption properties of OOHads after W doping. Moreover, the bond lengths between the surface atoms (Bi, V, or W) and adsorption species (OHads, Oads, and OOHads) become smaller after W doping, especially for the adsorption of OOHads on the V atoms; this indicates that W doping facilitates the adsorption of these species. A comparison of the adsorption of surface species involved in the water oxidation clearly indicates that W doping favors the surface catalysis process.

4. Discussion
Based on the abovementioned analyses, the mechanism of the effect of W doping on the performance of the BiVO4 photoanode for PEC water splitting performance has been proposed, as shown in Fig. 8. For the bulk charge separation, W doping greatly enhances the electron density and results in better electron separation. For surface catalysis, W doping greatly influences the adsorption of several key species on the BiVO4(010) facet and plays a key role in enhancing the hole transfer for water oxidation. For pristine BiVO4, the surface holes are dispersed on the Bi atoms, and no specific active sites can be distinguished as efficient oxidation sites. However, W doping activates the V atoms to be active reaction sites, which favors the adsorption of key species involved in the water oxidation process. PDOS also indicates that V contributes to the surface filled state. From the experimental observations, an active surface state was found after W doping, which was consistent with the theoretical calculations. It is reasonable to deduce that the active surface state is the surface V site, which functions as a charge transfer center. In addition, the bond lengths between the surface atoms (Bi, V, or W) and adsorption species (OHads, Oads, and OOHads) become smaller after W doping. The prediction from theoretical calculations is consistent with the observation of the active surface states and the lower hole transfer resistance found in the experiments. Thus, an enhanced surface hole transfer efficiency was observed after W doping into BiVO4.

5. Conclusion
Planar structured BiVO4 thin films with and without W doping have been successfully prepared. W doping did not change the morphology and crystallinity of the films. However, W doping significantly enhanced the photocurrent. The enhancement mainly originates from the improved charge separation and enhanced surface charge transfer. The enhanced charge separation is due to the improved carrier density caused by W doping. W doping also lowers the surface charge transfer resistance and forms active surface states that facilitate charge transfer. Theoretical analysis shows that W doping has changed the reactive surface sites from the Bi atom to the V atom. W doping also facilitates the adsorption of OHads, Oads and OOHads involved in the water splitting process. In addition, the bond lengths between the surface atoms (Bi, V, or W) and adsorption species (OHads, Oads, and OOHads) are shortened after W doping. The current study provides an important insight into the role of W doping in BiVO4, especially during surface catalysis.
