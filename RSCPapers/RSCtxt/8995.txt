    , Accepted 15th November 2021First published on 16th November 2021AbstractA novel quaternary oxysulfide, FeOCuS has been successfully synthesized with a tetragonal anti-PbO-type structure and a visible-light bandgap of about 1.37 eV. Driven by only a 0.4 V bias voltage under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination, a high photocurrent density of 3.89 mA cm−2 has been achieved, revealing the potential optoelectronic applications.
In recent decades, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their promising applications in superconductors,1 photovoltaics,2 thermoelectrics,3 battery electrodes,4 photodetectors5 and so on. However, up to now, TMDCs with excellent photoelectric properties are mostly confined to those with chalcopyrite structures and the related derivatives, such as CdTe,6 CuInS2 (CIS),7 Cu(InxGa1−x)Se2 (CIGS)8 and Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS),9 which still pose many challenges as they are environmentally unfriendly, are composed of scarce chemicals and have low efficiency. Recently, several layered oxychalcogenides (e.g. Bi2O2S(Se),10 and Bi4O4SeCl211), have been demonstrated as a special kind of quasi-two-dimensional (2D) layered materials with the advantages of ultra-high electron mobilities, suitable optical band gaps and reliable environmental stability, and have great potential in high-speed and low-power devices, quantum transport devices, and ultra-fast and high-sensitivity infrared light photoelectric detectors, etc.10a,b,11 However, among the 2D layered metal chalcogenides, the highest photoelectric efficiency of only 5.23% was achieved in monolayer MoS2 heterojunction solar cells so far.12 Although an outstanding conversion efficiency as high as 18.8% has been reported in layered oxychalcogenide BiOCuS using theoretical calculation studies,13 the experimental photocurrent of layered oxychalcogenides is still far lower than that of traditional chalcogenide photoelectric materials (on the order of mA cm−2), such as CIGS8 and CdTe.14 Hence, the exploration of new layered oxychalcogenides with superior photoelectric performance, and that are low-cost and environmentally friendly is highly desired for the practical application of layered oxychalcogenides.
Hydrothermal synthesis has been extensively employed to prepare various oxides and chalcogenides with excellent crystallinity, controllable morphology, uniform particle size and high purity.15 Moreover, single-crystal samples are considered the ideal candidate for the investigation of intrinsic physical properties.16 Therefore, either for fundamental research or practical application, it is of great significance to explore stoichiometric and high-quality single-crystal layered oxychalcogenides using an appropriate method. In this work, hydrothermal synthesis has been adopted for the fabrication of layered oxysulfide FeOCuS single crystals. In fact, the appealing performance of most 2D metal chalcogenides was only reported in their monolayer or multilayer species, resulting in high costs, low environmental stability, and inevitable defects. Interestingly, excellent photoelectric performance has been observed in bulk samples of FeOCuS, indicating its promising prospects in optoelectronic applications. Moreover, it can be expected that appropriate ionic doping and suitable ionic intercalations would introduce unique properties and new phenomena in this new type of layered oxysulfide, such as: Se doping for improved photoelectric properties; Li+ intercalation for application in batteries; and an expanded interlayer spacing leading to a striking HER performance.
FeOCuS crystallizes in a tetragonal structure with the space group P4/nmm. The lattice parameters of the title compound are a = b = 3.8219 Å and c = 8.6450 Å (detailed structure parameters are given in Tables S1 and S2, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1a, each Fe atom is coordinated to four O atoms to form the FeO4 tetrahedron and each Cu atom is coordinated to four S atoms to form the CuS4 tetrahedron. The MQ4 (M = Fe and Cu, Q = O and S) tetrahedra are arranged into a two-dimensional tetrahedral framework via edge sharing. The crystal structure features an anti-PbO-type layered structure constructed from [FeO] and [CuS] tetrahedral blocks alternately stacked along the [001] direction (see Fig. 1b and Fig. S1, ESI†). The interlayer spacing between the FeO4 and CuS4 layers and the thicknesses of the [FeO] and [CuS] blocks were calculated to be 2.3324 Å, 1.2864 Å and 2.6938 Å, respectively. The interlayer spacing is comparable with the typical two-dimensional material, graphene (∼3.2 Å),17 which shows great potential in lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and other fields due to its ionic intercalation properties. From Fig. 1c, it can be found that the identical Cu–S bond lengths of 2.3379 Å and the two similar S–Fe–S angles of 109.384° and 109.646° reveal an almost regular CuS4 tetrahedron, whereas the FeO4 tetrahedron exhibits a severe distortion with identical Fe–O bond lengths of 2.0163 Å and two distinct O–Fe–O angles of 95.840° and 142.796°. The phase purity and crystallinity of the FeOCuS powder sample were confirmed using powder XRD measurements. As shown in Fig. 1d, all the Bragg peaks from the powder XRD pattern are consistent with the simulated one derived from the single-crystal XRD data, revealing the high purity and excellent crystallinity.

The microstructure of FeOCuS was further confirmed using HRTEM. As shown in Fig. 2a, it can be observed that many individual clusters with distinct lattice fringes are separated from each other, which can be attributed to damage or deformation on the surface of the test sample caused by the powerful electron beam from the TEM. From the enlarged HRTEM micrograph (top-right inset in Fig. 2a), the two lattice fringes with d-spacings of 2.864 Å and 2.892 Å can be assigned to the typical (102) and (003) crystallographic planes viewed at the [100] direction, corresponding to the structural parameters derived from the XRD analysis. Furthermore, all the diffraction points from the electron diffraction pattern (see the bottom-right inset in Fig. 2a) can be well indexed using the structure model derived from the single-crystal XRD data. The appearance of the polycrystalline ring also reveals that the test sample is slightly defective. The morphology and crystallinity of FeOCuS were investigated using SEM (Fig. 2b). It can be found that microcrystalline FeOCuS presents a lamellar shape with a thickness of about several microns. EDS was conducted to determine the chemical composition of these lamellar crystals. As shown in the bottom-right inset in Fig. 2b, the elemental mapping images clearly indicate the uniform distribution of the elements Fe, Cu, O and S in a single crystal. All the elements in the selected regions analyzed using EDS show a constant ratio (Fig. S2, ESI†), which is in accordance with the stoichiometry of FeOCuS. The chemical compositions of the sample were also confirmed using ICP–OES measurements, which show an Fe/Cu/S atomic ratio of 1:0.98:0.95 (see Fig. S3, ESI†).

XPS spectra were obtained to check the oxidation states of the Fe, Cu, O and S atoms in FeOCuS. As shown in Fig. S4a (see the ESI†), the two peaks located at 710.8 and 724.9 eV could be identified as the binding energies of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively, which is in accordance with those of the previously reported Fe3+ oxidation state.18 The binding energies of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 (932.2 and 952.1 eV, Fig. S4b, ESI†) correspond to the typical Cu+ oxidation state.19 The XPS peaks of O 1s at 531.7 eV and S 2p1/2 at 163.4 eV (Fig. S4c and d, ESI†) correspond to the FeO4 and CuS4 tetrahedra as reported previously.20 The survey XPS spectra and C 1s reference spectra are given in Fig. S4e and f (see the ESI†). In fact, it is hard to distinguish Cu+ from Cu0 as the difference is only 0.1–0.2 eV. Thus, the Auger Cu LMM energy peak in the XPS spectra was utilized to distinguished the oxidation state of the Cu atoms in FeOCuS. Apparently, the associated Auger line Cu LMM at 569.5 eV (see Fig. S4g, ESI†) was much larger than that of Cu0 (568.0 eV) and was comparable to the typical value for Cu2S (569.6 eV),21 indicating that the Cu atom was in the form of Cu+.
UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was performed to identify the optical properties of FeOCuS. Commonly, for a direct band-gap material, the absorption coefficient can be depicted by the equation (αhν)2 = A(hν − Eg), where α is the absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, and ν is the frequency of the incident photon.22 As shown in the inset of Fig. 3a, by plotting (αhν)2versus the energy in eV and extrapolating the linear region to the x-axis intercept, the Eg of the sample can be obtained as 1.37 eV, which is very close to the ideal optical band gap of 1.5 eV for applications in the photoelectric field. Theoretical calculations have also been employed to gain deeper insight into the electronic structures of FeOCuS, such as the band structure, and the total and partial densities of states. As shown in Fig. S5 (see the ESI†), a direct bandgap can be obtained at about 1.38 eV at the G point, which matches well with the experimental result. Furthermore, the valence band maximum (VBM) is mainly composed of the Cu 3d and S 2p electronic states, whereas the conduction band minimum (CBM) is mostly contributed to by the Fe 3d and O 2p electronic states.

DTG measurements have been carried out to check the thermal stability of FeOCuS. As shown in Fig. 3b, almost no weight loss can be detected from room temperature to 562 K, revealing the excellent thermal stability of FeOCuS below 562 K. However the weight loss became extremely fast above 562 K and reached about 28.5% at 695 K, suggesting the decomposition of FeOCuS above 562 K. It is worth noting that the total weight ratio of the elements S and O in stoichiometric FeOCuS is about 28.7%. Thus, this 28.5% weight loss seems to correspond to the escape of the elements S and O (probably in the form of SO2 and S gas). However, according to the XRD results for the sample after annealing at 703 K (Fig. S6a, ESI†), the final decomposition products can be identified as Fe, FeS and Cu2S. Associated with a 2% weight increment from 695 to 892 K, two possible reactions in the heating process were proposed as: 2FeOCuS → Fe + Cu + SO2↑ + S↑ (from 552 to 695 K) and Fe + 2Cu + 2S → FeS + Cu2S (from 695 to 892 K). Additionally, no signal from Cu metal can be identified in the XRD pattern, as well as a weak XRD signal from Fe metal, which can be attributed to the formation of FeS and Cu2S coating on the surface of the Fe and Cu metals. Under an external magnetic field (see Fig. S6b, ESI†), the annealed sample can be easily lifted by a magnet while the pristine sample has no response to the magnet, suggesting the existence of Fe metal. Thus, in order to ensure the phase stability of FeOCuS for the resistivity and photoelectric measurements as discussed later, the annealing of the ceramic sample was performed below 562 K.
The magnetic and electrical properties of FeOCuS were investigated using PPMS. From the 1/χ vs. T plot with the ZFC model (see Fig. S7, ESI†), the high temperature region data can be fitted well using the Curie–Weiss (CW) law with a negative θ value (−98.54 K), indicating the dominance of the antiferromagnetic contribution in FeOCuS. Considering that Cu+ is nonmagnetic, these results directly revealed the antiferromagnetic nature of the FeO4 tetrahedra. The thermal stability of the annealed ceramic sample was confirmed using XRD analysis (as shown in Fig. S8, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4a, the resistivity exhibits a typical exponential temperature dependency, indicating the semiconducting nature of FeOCuS. Generally, three electronic transport models have been utilized to describe semiconducting transport behavior, namely, the thermal activation (TA) model, the variable range hopping (VRH) model, and the small polaron hopping (SPH) model. A detailed description of these three models has been given in the ESI.† Herein, the ρ(T) curve was analyzed using all three models. From the insets of Fig. 4a the fitting results demonstrate that the ρ(T) curve can be well fitted using the VRH model in almost the entire temperature range, whereas it can be only fitted using the TA and SPH models in the initial high temperature region. The fitting parameters obtained from the fitting results for the high temperature region of the VRH model are presented in Table S3 (see the ESI†). In the present system, the alternating stacks of CuS4 and FeO4 tetrahedra constructed an anti-PbO-type layered structure. The eg electron has to hop between the layers, resulting in semiconducting behavior. Thus, the electronic transport behavior of FeOCuS can be described well using the VRH model rather than the SPH model, corresponding with the results for many other layered oxychalcogenides.23

(b) The I–V curves of FeOCuS in the dark and under visible-light illumination at room temperature. (c) The I–T curve of FeOCuS at a 0.05 V bias voltage following on–off visible–light exposure. 
Considering the visible-light absorption and semiconducting nature, the photoelectric properties of FeOCuS were detected using the ceramic sample. Fig. 4b shows the photocurrent voltage (I–V) curves of the ceramic sample measured in the dark and under visible-light illumination. A notable photoconductive effect can be observed in FeOCuS under illumination, corresponding to its small Eg and semiconducting nature. It is worth noting that the dark current of FeOCuS seems somewhat large, which is probably caused by its relatively small resistivity at room temperature (∼7.05 Ω cm−2 at 293 K). However, the photocurrent is still on the order of mA cm−2, revealing the intrinsic excellent photoelectric properties of FeOCuS. To substantiate this claim, the steady state photocurrent–time (I–T) curve for the ceramic sample was measured at a 0.05 V bias voltage under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) as shown in Fig. 4c. Interestingly, the high photocurrent density can reach 1.23 mA cm−2 driven by only a 50 mV bias voltage, which is much higher than some outstanding photoelectric detectors, such as Bi9O7.5S623b and Bi2O2S.10b Actually, it has been demonstrated previously that the bias voltage plays an important role in the photoelectric properties of semiconductors. As shown in Fig. S9 (see the ESI†), with increasing bias voltage, the photocurrent increases almost linearly up to 0.4 V, and tends to be constant (∼3.89 mA cm−2) above 0.4 V, indicating the powerful driving force offered by the external electric field for the efficient separation of photogenerated carriers. Additionally, the response time of the ceramic sample was obtained as 0.93 s, which was defined as the time required to rise from the end of the dark current to the turning point of the photocurrent curve (see Fig. S10, ESI†). When the turning point is crossed, the photocurrent keeps increasing monotonically, which could be attributed to the photothermal effect as previously reported for many other photoelectric materials.24 This photoelectric performance renders FeOCuS a promising candidate for optoelectronic applications.
In summary, a new layered quaternary oxysulfide FeOCuS has been synthesized hydrothermally. Its anti-PbO-type tetragonal structure with a space group of P4/nmm has been determined using single-crystal XRD diffraction. The oxidation states of Fe3+ and Cu+ are demonstrated using XPS measurements. The magnetic studies of FeOCuS reveal its antiferromagnetic nature, which originates from the FeO4 tetrahedral layers. The electrical property of FeOCuS exhibits a semiconducting behavior and can be better explained using the VRH model than the SPH model. Additionally, a notable visible-light photoelectric response has been observed in FeOCuS, indicating that this new layered oxysulfide has great potential in the field of optoelectronic devices.
