    , Accepted 14th December 2017First published on 14th December 2017AbstractA novel environmentally-friendly hyperbranched electrolyte PNSO3Na organic interfacial layer has been synthesized; this can tune the interfacial energy alignment and induce the upper active layer to form a bi-continuous nano-micro phase separation face-on orientation. Based on a PBDB-T:ITIC active layer, the device with a ZnO/PNSO3Na ETL exhibits a high efficiency of 11.2%.
Recently, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted increasing attention due to their outstanding advantages such as being low-cost and lightweight and their large-area printing through low-cost solution processing.1–5 BHJ PSCs have seen dramatic progress in the past decade and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been boosted to over 13%.6–8 However, there is still a long way to go for their commercial large-scale printing production. Recently, to further enhance the PCE of the device, considerable efforts have been focused on the development of nonfullerene PSCs.9–11 The morphologies of the active layers play crucial roles in the photoelectric conversion process. Moreover, it's very difficult to improve the morphology of the active layer by fine design and synthesis of the donor and acceptor materials. Interfacial engineering is also very critical for optimizing the PCE of nonfullerene PSCs. Nevertheless, many efforts have been dedicated to the synthesis of new active layer materials. Until now, few studies have been devoted to the interfacial engineering of nonfullerene PSCs. Introducing an appropriate interfacial layer between the active layer and the cathode electrode is an effective way to decrease the exciton recombination probability and interfacial barrier, and to acquire matched energy levels.12,13 The decreased interfacial barrier and improved interfacial contact are beneficial for efficient charge separation, transportation and collection, which can enhance the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of PSCs.14–20 Among all the interlayers, organic small molecule electrolytes (SMEs) have attracted more and more research interest due to their unique intrinsic advantages, such as easy purification, facile synthesis, well-defined chemical structure, being uniform batch-to-batch and so on.21–26
Apart from high performance active layer materials, interpenetrated network bi-continuous nano-micro phase separation morphologies and a preferable face-on orientation of the donor and acceptor are also necessary for improving the device performance. However, the construction of a bi-continuous nano-micro phase separation of the active layer is always much more difficult and complex than developing a new simple interlayer material. In fact, interface induction of the self-assembled organic electron transport layer (ETL) is a facile way to simultaneously optimize the morphology of the active layer and improve the interfacial contact, especially in inverted PSCs. However, most studies of organic ETLs only focus on tuning the energy levels. The formation of a bi-continuous nano-micro phase morphology of the active layer modulated by the ETL has never been reported. Chen and co-workers performed a thorough study on the effects of the number of polar groups in the ETLs on the performances of the PSCs and the results suggested that increasing the number of polar groups in the ETLs is favorable for forming an active layer with a smooth and homogeneous morphology, as well as for improving the PCE of the device.27 If the SME not only contains several polar pendants, but can also induce the active layer to self-assemble into bi-continuous nano-micro phase separation morphologies, it could be the most promising ETL.
In this work, using a simple, green, one-step reaction with non-halogenated solvents, we first design and synthesize a new hyperbranched self-assembled SME, 5,8,11,14,17-pentabutylsulfonic sodium-1,21-disulfonic sodium-5,8,11,14,17-pentamine (PNSO3Na), then employ ZnO/PNSO3Na as the ETL for nonfullerene PSCs. Owing to the seven butyl sulfonate sodium groups, the hyperbranched SME PNSO3Na ETL can form interfacial dipoles and lower the work function of ZnO coated ITO substrates, boosting the charge extraction and enhancing the PCE of PSCs. Notably, a well-defined nanofiber morphology of the self-assembled ZnO/PNSO3Na ETL can further act as a template to induce the upper active layer to form a bi-continuous nano-micro phase separation structure, as well as a preferable face-on orientation. As a result, the device based on a PBDB-T:ITIC active layer with a ZnO/PNSO3Na ETL shows an outstanding PCE of up to 11.2%.
The structure of the hyperbranched SME PNSO3Na ETL is shown in Chart 1 and the detailed synthetic route to the hyperbranched SME is displayed in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The hyperbranched SME, PNSO3Na, is first prepared by a green, one-step simple reaction between tetraethylene pentamine and 1,4-butanesultone with non-halogenated solvents and purified by easy dialysis. Thanks to the polar butylsulfonic sodium groups, the butylsulfonic sodium can be readily dissolved in environmentally friendly polar solvents, such as water and methanol. The chemical structure of PNSO3Na is confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (NMR) (Fig. S1, ESI†).
 Chart 1  Chemical structure of the hyperbranched small molecule electrolyte (SME), PNSO3Na. 
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the UV-vis absorption spectra of the ZnO and ZnO/PNSO3Na and the UV-vis absorption and cyclic voltammogram (CV) spectra of PNSO3Na film are shown in Fig. S2–S4 (ESI†).
The polar branched chains in the hyperbranched SME, PNSO3Na, prefer to form an aligned dipole moment at the metal electrode/organic active layer interface, which can modify the work function (WF) of the electrode due to the shift of the vacuum-level.28 Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) is performed to explore the effects of the hyperbranched SME, PNSO3Na, on the energy levels of ZnO (Fig. S5a, ESI†). The energy levels of ZnO and ZnO/PNSO3Na are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Fig. S5b (ESI†) is the schematic energy-level diagram of the PSCs and electrical contacts of the ETLs based on a PBDB-T:ITIC device. To further explore the interfacial interaction and the effects of the interface dipoles on the WF of the electrode, the effective WF of pristine ZnO and PNSO3Na modified ZnO has been measured by Kelvin probe microscopy (KPM), as presented in Fig. S5c (ESI†). The WF of bare ZnO is 4.40 eV. Delightfully, with respect to bare ZnO, the WF of PNSO3Na modified ZnO has decreased by 0.48 eV, with a WF of 3.92 eV. To more visually understand the variation of WF between ZnO and ZnO/PNSO3Na, the bar graphs of work function according to KPM are shown in Fig. S5d (ESI†). The KPM result is consistent with the UPS measurement. In addition, both the results of KPM and UPS demonstrate that a strong interfacial interaction and interfacial dipole have been formed in the interface of ZnO and PNSO3Na, which can decrease the WF of the ITO electrode and improve the interfacial contact between ITO and the active layer. The interfacial dipoles originate from the dipole moments of PNSO3Na itself and the interfacial interaction between PNSO3Na and ZnO. The dipole moment of PNSO3Na calculated using a theoretical calculation is 8.2839 D (Fig. S6, ESI†). This improved interfacial contact is beneficial for charge separation and transport.
To explore the effects of the hyperbranched SME, PNSO3Na, on the performance of PSCs, ZnO and ZnO/PNSO3Na are utilized as the ETLs with a device configuration of ITO/ETLs/PBDB-T:ITIC/MoO3/Ag and the detailed information of the device’s fabrication process is described in the ESI.† The illuminated current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics based on the PBDB-T:ITIC active layer measured under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 1a, and the corresponding device parameters are shown in Table S2 (ESI†).
 Fig. 1  (a) J–V characteristics of the PBDB-T:ITIC-based devices with ZnO and ZnO/PNSO3Na ETLs and (b) EQE. 
The device with a bare ZnO ETL exhibits a PCE of 9.9% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.861 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.815 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 64.7%. Intriguingly, the efficiency of the device based on the ZnO/PNSO3Na ETL has been dramatically enhanced, with a PCE of up to 11.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.874 V, a Jsc of 18.658 mA cm−2 and a FF of 68.7%. Note that all the device parameters, including Voc, Jsc, PCE and FF, have been improved simultaneously. Obviously, the enhanced Voc value originates from the improved interfacial contact between the active layer and the ZnO. The enhanced Jsc and FF values should be ascribed to the well-defined bi-continuous nano-micro phase separation morphology of the active layer induced by the self-assembled ZnO/PNSO3Na ETL. To further understand the greatly enhanced Jsc, we measured the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the inverted devices based on ZnO and ZnO/PNSO3Na ETLs, as presented in Fig. 1b. Evidently, the device based on the ZnO/PNSO3Na ETL possesses higher EQE values between 450–710 nm than that based on the ZnO ETL. Moreover, the Jsc obtained from the EQE with the ZnO/PNSO3Na ETL is 0.93 mA cm−2 higher in comparison to that of the ZnO ETL, which is consistent with the result of the illuminated J–V curves with consideration of instrument error.
Since the active layer morphology of the bulk heterojunction PSC potentially depended on the substrate underneath, in order to investigate the causes of the dramatically enhanced Jsc and FF, and to prove that the self-assembled ZnO/PNSO3Na ETL can induce the upper active layer PBDB-T:ITIC to form a bi-continuous nano-micro phase separation morphology, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is performed. The height images are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding phase images are presented in Fig. S7 (ESI†). For bare ZnO, a typical spheroidal structure can be observed with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.80 nm (Fig. 2a), while for ZnO/PNSO3Na well-defined nanofiber structures are formed and the RMS roughness is increased to 7.03 nm (Fig. 2b). ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC shows a smooth morphology with a RMS roughness of 2.83 nm (Fig. 2c). Delightfully, a well-organized bi-continuous nano-micro phase separation morphology with a RMS roughness of 5.67 nm is indeed formed when PBDB-T:ITIC is spin-coated on the ZnO/PNSO3Na ETL (Fig. 2d).

From the phase images in Fig. S7 (ESI†), we can also clearly observe that the well-defined nanofiber structures of ZnO/PNSO3Na can further act as a template to induce the upper active layer PBDB-T:ITIC to form bi-continuous nano-micro phase separation structures, which are beneficial for realizing efficient exciton dissociations and transfer in the device, as well as for the significant enhancement of the Jsc and FF values. Meanwhile, the three-dimensional AFM images of ZnO, ZnO/PNSO3Na, ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC and ZnO/PNSO3Na/PBDB-T:ITIC films are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†).

Fig. 3 shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the morphology of the ETL and the corresponding active layer. A typical spherical structure has been observed in bare ZnO. Interestingly, a large amount of nano-fibers can be clearly observed in the ZnO/PNSO3Na film. The TEM image of ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC exhibits a classical PBDB-T:ITIC film morphology, however, plenty of bi-continuous nano-micro phase separation fibers can be found in the ZnO/PNSO3Na/PBDB-T:ITIC film, which is in good agreement with the AFM measurements. The bi-continuous nanofibers of the active layer are very beneficial to charge separation and transfer. The improved morphologies of the interlayers and the active layer can account for the increase in Jsc and FF values.

To further determine whether the well-defined bi-continuous nano phase-separation morphologies of the active layer will facilitate the exciton dissociations and transfer, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL decay measurements are carried out with a configuration of ITO/ETL/PBDB-T:ITIC. As listed in Fig. S9 (ESI†), compared to ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC, ITO/ZnO/PNSO3Na/PBDB-T:ITIC causes strong fluorescence quenching, indicating more efficient charge separation and transformation from the active layer to the ETL. In addition, from the time-resolved PL decay measurements, the average PL decay time (τaver) is found to be 1.3666 ns for ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC, nevertheless, the τaver value decreases to 0.7997 ns for ITO/ZnO/PNSO3Na/PBDB-T:ITIC. The fluorescence quenching and the reduced the PL decay time can further demonstrate that the nano-phase separation morphologies of PBDB-T:ITIC induced by the ZnO/PNSO3Na interlayer are in favor of efficient electron separation and transport.
The UV-vis spectra of the upper active layer PBDB-T:ITIC films deposited on the ZnO and ZnO/PNSO3Na ETLs are shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). Compared with the ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC film, that of ZnO/PNSO3Na/PBDB-T:ITIC shows a red-shift band with higher intensity, indicating a more ordered arrangement of the active layer. Moreover, an obviously enhanced shoulder peak at about 710 nm has been observed in the ZnO/PNSO3Na/PBDB-T:ITIC film relative to that of the ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC.
The molecular packing behaviors of the PBDB-T-ITIC film spin-coated ZnO and ZnO/PNSO3Na ETLs are assessed by two-dimensional grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D GIWAXS) measurements, as shown in Fig. 4a and b. Remarkably, compared to ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC, ZnO/PNSO3Na/PBDB-T:ITIC exhibits a more ordered preferential face-on orientation with respect to the electrode substrates. The out-of-plane and in-plane line cuts from the GIWAXS are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). We note that the peak positions of PBDB-T and ITIC have overlap in the q-range of 1.7–1.8 Å−1.29 Obviously, stronger out-of plane π–π (010) stacking peaks at q = 1.79 Å−1 (PBDB-T:ITIC) are observed for ZnO/PNSO3Na/PBDB-T:ITIC in contrast to ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC, indicating that ZnO/PNSO3Na/PBDB-T:ITIC exhibits a more ordered preferential face-on orientation. The predominant face-on arrangement is favorable to charge transport, which can well explain the largely enhanced Jsc value.

In summary, one novel hyperbranched SME, PNSO3Na, has been designed and synthesized via a green one-step reaction with non-halogenated solvents and purified using a dialysis bag. The ZnO/PNSO3Na ETL exhibits high transparency and a well-defined nanofiber morphology. Meanwhile, due to the seven moles of butyl sulfonate sodium, a hyperbranched SME, PNSO3Na, organic interfacial layer can form interfacial dipoles, lower the work function of ZnO coated ITO substrates and decrease the interfacial barrier. More importantly, the well-defined nanofiber morphology of ZnO/PNSO3Na can further induce the upper active layer to form bi-continuous nano-micro phase separation morphologies. Furthermore, in comparison to bare ZnO, ZnO/PNSO3Na can induce the upper active layer to form a more ordered dominating face-on orientation. The PBDB-T:ITIC-based inverted PSCs with an outstanding PCE of 11.2% are obtained through incorporation of a solution processed ZnO/PNSO3Na ETL. These results demonstrate that the hyperbranched PNSO3Na modified ZnO ETL is an attractive and facile way to modulate the morphology of the active layer and to improve the performance of PSCs, especially for large-scale fully printed applications.
