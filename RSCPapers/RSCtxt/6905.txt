1 Introduction
As the modern industry rapidly develops, the ever-increasing combustion of traditional fossil fuels (mainly coal, petroleum, and natural gas) has caused excessive release of CO2, leading to severe global environmental and climate change.1–5 Currently, the energy crisis and climate change are the two major worldwide challenges to human beings. The development of effective technologies for renewable energy production and carbon emission reduction becomes a critical and imperative task. Conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals is highly expected to be a sustainable alternative to simultaneously solve these two issues. The current approaches of CO2 conversion generally include biological, thermochemical, plasma, electrochemical, and photocatalytic methods.6–9
Conversion of biomass to fuels is one of the practical approaches for CO2 conversion.6,7 The basic process usually consists of three steps, intake of CO2 in the atmosphere via photosynthesis for biomass production, conversion of biomass to bioethanol or biodiesel via a biochemical procedure, and generation of biogas (CH4) using the biological residue. Although the production of fuels from biomass is rapidly increasing year by year, the highest conversion efficiency is only about 1%, and the extra energy input required for biomass processing further reduces this value. Accordingly, biofuels are unlikely to play a crucial role in future energy infrastructure.8 Direct decomposition of CO2 into CO and O2 is involved in the thermochemical conversion process.6 The resultant CO can be mixed with H2 produced from renewable energy to obtain syngas. For 100% CO2 conversion, the reaction temperature should reach at least 3075 °C.10 Theoretically, the yield of CO can reach about 30% when the temperature approaches 2400 °C.11 However, in fact, the efficiency is much lower than this value due to the presence of reverse reactions. Additionally, rapid separation of the products is another major issue in such a single-step process. Compared to thermochemical methods, the use of plasma to convert CO2 to CH4 has the advantage of relatively low temperature and pressure.9 However, high energy is still required to generate the electrons and free radicals during the reaction process. Electrochemical reduction is another route for the efficient transformation of CO2 to chemicals and fuels.12–16 However, a large amount of energy is consumed due to the high overpotential for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, which becomes a bottleneck for commercial applications.
Mimicking natural photosynthesis, solar-driven catalytic CO2 conversion to value-added chemicals provides a promising route to address both environmental and energy concerns via direct utilization of endless and sustainable solar energy.17–22 Since the first study of photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction reported by Halmann in 1978 and by Inoue in 1979, solar-driven CO2 reduction has attracted extensive attention.23,24 There have been several informative reviews on photocatalytic CO2 conversion in the past few decades, which focus mainly on the general design and synthesis of various semiconductor catalysts and reactors, as well as CO2 reduction principles.25–34 Currently, no specific or updated review is available on zinc chalcogenide-based catalysts, though they are widely used for CO2 reduction.
Being important group II–VI semiconductor catalysts, zinc chalcogenides have been intensively studied due to their rich morphology at the nanoscale, good photocatalytic performance, low cost, nontoxicity, and environmentally benign nature.35–38 Zinc chalcogenides possess similar crystal structures in the bulk form at ambient pressure, which can crystallize in a hexagonal wurtzite structure (W), cubic zinc blende structure (ZB), or both.35 As exhibited in Fig. 1a, the ZB and W structures are composed of tetrahedrally coordinated zinc and chalcogen atoms stacked in the ABCABC and ABABAB patterns, respectively. The major difference between these two structures lies in the coordination environment of the fourth interatomic bond or in their dihedral conformations. ZB has a cubic close-packed and a face-centered cubic structure, while W has a hexagonal close packing structure. In addition, ZB has four asymmetric units in its unit cell, while W has two asymmetric units.

Fig. 1b shows the alignment of energy levels for zinc chalcogenides. ZnO and ZnS are inactive under visible-light illumination, and are only responsive to UV light due to the wide bandgap nature (3.2 and 3.7 eV, respectively).36,37 In comparison, ZnSe has a narrow bandgap of 2.7 eV, while ZnTe possesses the narrowest bandgap of 2.2 eV.35,38 So ZnSe and ZnTe are visible-light-responsive photocatalysts. Considering that the redox potentials of most CO2 reduction products are at around −0.24 to −0.61 V (vs. NHE), from the thermodynamic point of view, all the zinc chalcogenide-based catalysts are promising for CO2 photoreduction since the potential of the conduction band (CB) is negative enough. Moreover, many properties of the zinc chalcogenides can be finely and readily tuned by controlling the microstructure (like defects, morphology, and exposed facets), such as adsorption/desorption of chemical species and band structure (bandgap, position of the CB and valence band (VB)), and thus photocatalytic performance can be readily modulated. For instance, defects like cation vacancy (VZn) and anion vacancy can be readily formed and adjusted. As a consequence, adsorption (desorption) of the reactants (products), light harvesting, and charge separation can be easily modulated. Furthermore, the surface hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of zinc chalcogenide-based catalysts can also be regulated in the presence of defects, which usually has an impact on the CO2 photoreduction. A hydrophobic surface can slow the transport rate of H2O and limit the accessibility of H2O molecules to the catalyst surface owing to the hydrophobic effect, leading to suppressed H2 evolution.39–41 So competitive CO2 reduction over H2 production can be readily controlled.
Among the zinc chalcogenide-based catalysts, ZnX is an n-type semiconductor when X is O, S and Se, while ZnTe is a p-type semiconductor. Thus, type-II, p–n and Z-scheme heterojunctions can easily be fabricated among themselves and/or with other semiconductors possessing a suitable band structure. Last but not least, zinc chalcogenide-based catalysts can bear a rich variety of ligands via surface functionalization, which can immobilize various molecular catalysts on the surface, providing a perfect platform for the fabrication of highly efficient hybrid systems. Thus, an updated review is highly expected considering the great progress achieved.
In this review, the representative work on solar-driven zinc chalcogenide-based nanocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction is systematically summarized, including nanocatalysts based on ZnO, ZnS, ZnSe and ZnTe (Table 1). The basic principles of CO2 photoreduction are first briefly discussed. Then various strategies used to modulate the photocatalytic performance are elaborated based on the three major photocatalysis processes of light harvesting, charge separation and surface reactions (Fig. 2), such as microstructure modulation, surface functionalization, formation of ternary zinc chalcogenides, heterojunction construction, and hybridization with molecular catalysts. Finally, the challenges and future outlook are summarized. We envision that this review can facilitate the rational design of novel photocatalysts with high activity and selectivity for CO2 photoreduction.

 Fig. 2  Various strategies to improve the CO2 photoreduction performance of zinc-chalcogenide catalysts. 
2 Fundamentals of CO2 photoreduction
Generally, semiconductor photocatalyst powders are suspended in a CO2-saturated solution, in which solar light provides the driving force for CO2 photoreduction. The photocatalytic reaction usually consists of three crucial processes, as shown in Fig. 3.31–33 First, electron–hole pairs will be generated upon illumination with the photon energy equal to or above the bandgap value of the semiconductor photocatalyst. The carriers are subsequently separated and migrate to the catalyst surface, during which the majority of electrons and holes will be annihilated via surface/bulk recombination. Finally, the surviving electrons can reduce CO2 into value-added chemicals, and the holes can oxidize H2O into O2. The band structure of semiconductor photocatalysts plays a crucial role in dominating the CO2 photoreduction performance. Specifically, the energy levels of the CB and VB, respectively, determine the reduction and oxidation power of charge carriers. Theoretically, a semiconductor should have a more negative CB minimum than the reduction potential of product(s)/CO2, and a more positive VB maximum than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O. Besides the thermodynamic requirement, the sluggish kinetics should be considered too, which usually manifests as a high overpotential associated with a multi-electron transfer process.
 Fig. 3  Photocatalyst powders suspended in a CO2-containing solution and schematic description of the different processes involved in photocatalytic CO2 reduction over a semiconductor photocatalyst. 
CO2 is a linear molecule containing two CO bonds. The orbitals of the carbon atom are sp-hybridized, combining with oxygen atoms to form two σ bonds, and the two remaining nonhybridized p orbitals in the carbon atom connect with the p orbitals in oxygen atoms to form two π34 bonds. The dissociation energy of the CO bond in CO2 can reach as high as 750 kJ mol−1, which is much higher than the bond energy of C–H (411 kJ mol−1), C–O (327 kJ mol−1) and C–C (336 kJ mol−1). The extreme stability of the CO2 molecule indicates that a tremendous energy input is needed to break the CO bonds during the CO2 reduction reaction.28,29 Moreover, various reduction products (such as CH4, CO, HCOOH and CH3OH) can be produced during the CO2 reduction. Table 2 summarizes the standard enthalpy (ΔHθ) and Gibbs free energy (ΔGθ) of CO2 photoreduction. Compared with the ΔGθ of H2O splitting (237 kJ mol−1), the CO2 reduction process requires a much higher ΔGθ value, implying that the CO2 reduction is much more endothermic and thus is thermodynamically unfavorable.

The thermodynamic redox potentials for various products of CO2 photoreduction and water splitting are listed in Table 3. One widely recognized mechanism for CO2 photoreduction is adsorption and activation of the CO2 molecule to form a  intermediate via single-electron transfer.29,30 Transformation from a linear structure to a bent  radical requires very high reorganization energy, which is often considered the rate-determining step for CO2 reduction that is thermodynamically unfavorable because of the high potential of −1.9 V (vs. NHE). Most of the semiconductors cannot provide enough driving force for this single-electron transfer since the CB minimum is less negative than this potential. As a result, this one-electron reduction process can hardly occur without an external force.

Alternatively, CO2 reduction can be achieved through a multiple-proton coupled multiple-electron transfer process, and the large activation barrier can be significantly lowered via simultaneous transfer of electrons and protons.30 As shown in Table 2, various CO2 reduction products can be obtained, corresponding to different number of transferred protons and electrons. Clearly, a low energy barrier is required for the multiple-proton coupled charge transfer process. However, sufficient electrons and protons are required, such as six and eight electrons (protons) for CH3OH and CH4 formation, respectively. As a result, the efficiency and selectivity are greatly limited by the sluggish kinetics. Though significant progress has been made in the conversion of CO2 to CO and HCOOH, CO2 reduction into products like CH4 and CH3OH has been reported only with very low efficiency. To overcome these thermodynamic and kinetic difficulties in the CO2 photoreduction into hydrocarbons, one needs to focus on the factors that can influence the aforementioned three key steps involved in the photocatalysis, especially charge generation/separation and surface chemical reactions. Typical strategies to promote the CO2 photoreduction performance over zinc chalcogenide-based photocatalysts are thus discussed thoroughly in the following sections.
3 Microstructure modulation
3.1 Morphology, particle size and crystal structure
The morphology, particle size and crystal structure of a semiconductor catalyst have a strong impact on the charge separation and migration,42 which are usually modulated for the enhancement of CO2 photoreduction performance. The specific surface area is closely related to the catalytic performance and is strongly dependent on the morphology of a photocatalyst. Thus, the morphology with a hierarchical structure is preferred for high specific surface area. For instance, Wan et al. synthesized porous rectangular and assembled hexagonal ZnO plates via different decomposition processes of NH4Zn3(OH)6NO3.43 The porous ZnO plates show better CO2 photoreduction performance owing to their large specific surface area. Lee et al. demonstrated the synthesis of mesoporous ZnS and ZnSe via the utilization of mesoporous silica KIT-6 as the template.44 The mesoporous ZnS shows much higher CO2 photoreduction performance than ZnSe since the latter exhibits high photoluminescence. Similarly, Fahad et al. synthesized hollow mesoporous ZnTe microspheres by a solvothermal method for CO2 reduction, in which NaOH plays an important role in controlling the hollow morphology of ZnTe (Fig. 4a–d).45 After 8 h illumination, 8.4 and 5.6 μmol g−1 yield of CH4 was, respectively, obtained for the ZnTe microspheres and nanocrystals (Fig. 4e). The higher activity for the hollow mesoporous microspheres is ascribed to their larger surface area and higher CO2 adsorption capacity than those of the nanocrystals.

Besides the morphology, particle size is also one important factor affecting the photocatalytic activity of nanocatalysts.42 On the one hand, decreasing the particle size usually leads to increased active sites and surface area, which are vital to the surface catalytic reactions. On the other hand, the diffusion pathway of charge carriers will be shortened as the particle size decreases, thus greatly suppressing the charge recombination. For instance, Baran et al. prepared two ZnS nanocrystals with different sizes via different procedures, ZnS-A (3.3 nm) and ZnS-B (20.6 nm).46 ZnS-A shows superior CO2 photoreduction activity to ZnS-B, which is mainly due to the differences in particle size. ZnS/MMT nanocatalysts were prepared by depositing ZnS nanoparticles on montmorillonite (MMT) (Fig. 4f and g).47 Although the pristine MMT shows no CO2 reduction activity, all the ZnS/MMT composites can catalyze the CO2 photoreduction, depending on the loading amount of ZnS. This is because the ZnS amount can influence the agglomeration degree on the MMT, which further changes the electronic structure of ZnS, and thus correlates with the CO2 reduction activity of ZnS/MMT. A similar phenomenon was also reported by Johne et al.48 ZnS was loaded on the SiO2 substrate with a large surface area (340 m2 g−1) for CO2 photoreduction, and the maximum production rate of formate is observed with the loading of 13% ZnS on SiO2.
The correlation between size and photocatalytic performance was studied by Heagy et al.49 Wurtzite nanoparticles (nP-Wurtz), sphalerite nanoparticles (nP-Sphal) and large sphalerite microparticles (mP-Sphal) were used for CO2 photoreduction. No significant difference is observed in the bandgap and band structure among these particles, while an obvious difference exists in their photocatalytic activity. nP-Wurtz shows the highest activity, and mP-Sphal shows the lowest. Besides the particle size, these results also imply that the crystal structure of the catalysts may also affect the efficiency of CO2 photocatalytic reduction.
As a matter of fact, the crystal structure is another important factor that has a great effect on the CO2 photoreduction activity. In general, semiconductors with mixed crystal structures exhibit superior performance to the single phase. Li et al. reported ZnS nanoparticles with sphalerite and wurtzite mixed crystal structures synthesized via simple hydrothermal decomposition of a ZnS(en)0.5 precursor (Fig. 5a and b).50 It is found that ZnS nanoparticles with the phase junction exhibit high photocatalytic performance towards solar fuel production. After 4 h illumination, the H2 and CO yield reached 31.5 mmol g−1 and 279.3 μmol g−1, respectively. The improved performance can be ascribed to the greatly promoted charge separation owing to the phase junction in the ZnS nanoparticles. More importantly, the competition mechanism between CO2 photoreduction and hydrogen evolution is clarified by combining both dynamic and thermodynamic results. It is demonstrated that the sluggish CO desorption greatly hinders the photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance, which is the rate-determining step, and thus leads to relatively higher H2 selectivity (Fig. 5c).

3.2 Crystal facet engineering
Semiconductor photocatalysts with different crystal facets possess different atomic arrangements and electronic structures, exhibiting distinctive photocatalytic performance. Thus, tailoring the crystal facet is an effective approach to tune the photocatalytic activity of semiconductor catalysts.51–54 Liu et al. prepared ZnO catalysts with three different morphologies (nanorods, microspheres, and microflowers) via a facile solvothermal approach with water and ethanol as the solvent.55 The different exposed crystal facets of ZnO can be tailored via altering the volume ratio of water and ethanol. The photocatalytic results demonstrate that ZnO with a high ratio of exposed {0001} facets exhibits higher CO yield (3.814 μmol g−1 h−1) than the microspheres (3.357 μmol g−1 h−1) and microflowers (1.627 μmol g−1 h−1). Hu et al. synthesized ZnO micro- and nano-structures with controlled morphology using a facile hydrothermal method.56 As the pH value of the precursor increases, sheet-like ZnO mainly exposing a polar crystal plane changes into rod-like ZnO with a predominant nonpolar crystal plane. Sheet-like ZnO exhibits superior photocatalytic performance to rod-like ZnO due to the different catalytic activity of different crystal planes.
To elucidate the related photocatalytic mechanism of the effect of exposed crystal facets on CO2 photoreduction, Li et al. studied the CO2 photoreduction activity and selectivity over ZnO nanosheets with exposed {110} and {001} facets (Fig. 6a–d).57 It was found that ZnO with a {110} facet shows significantly higher activity than the {001} facet, and the reason is systematically analyzed on the basis of theoretical calculations and experimental characterization. The time-resolved fluorescence decay and photocurrent response demonstrate that ZnO nanosheets with an exposed 110 facet (denoted as ZnO-110) exhibit higher charge separation efficiency (Fig. 6e and f). Additionally, ZnO-110 is beneficial to the adsorption and activation of CO2 (Fig. 6g and h). As a result, ZnO-110 shows superior CO2 photoreduction performance due to the synergic effect of the promoted separation of carriers and effective CO2 adsorption and activation.

3.3 Defect engineering
Defect engineering is regarded as a promising approach to tune the photocatalytic performance of nanocatalysts, and has recently attracted widespread attention.58–65 The formation of defects is inevitable during the synthesis of semiconductor nanocatalysts, and is intimately associated with light absorption, charge carrier separation, and CO2 activation. Oxygen vacancy (VO) is the most studied defect in metal oxides, and plays an important role in modulating the CO2 photoreduction activity. Guo et al. prepared ZnO2-promoted ZnO nanorods via treatment with H2O2.66 The excess ZnO2 can increase the surface area and enhance the concentration of VO defects. The presence of VO defects significantly enhances the CO2 adsorption capacity, leading to good photocatalytic activity. The surface VO can also provide active sites for adsorption and activation of CO2, which can help to lower the position of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital via the interaction with CO2 molecules. As a consequence, the activation energy can be lowered and formation of b-CO32− and HCO3− intermediates can be greatly enhanced, which eventually have a positive effect on the selectivity for CH4 and CH3OH production.
In addition, Li et al. synthesized porous ZnO nanoplates with VO defects via the thermal treatment of ZnS(en)0.5 in air.67 The concentration of VO defects can be tailored by changing the annealing temperature, and thus the photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction. It is found that the defects are beneficial for charge separation. Additionally, the defects are also beneficial for adsorption and activation of CO2 on the ZnO surface. Besides the single VO, Xin et al. fabricated three ZnO samples (ZnO particles, nanorods and nanosheets) with VO and zinc vacancy (VZn) using different preparation methods (Fig. 7a–i).68 In comparison with ZnO nanoparticles and nanorods, the porous ZnO nanosheets exhibit much higher activity because of the existence of VO and VZn (Fig. 7j). These defects can decrease the recombination of charge carriers and facilitate generation of basic zinc carbonate via a Lewis acid–base reaction, which is a critical intermediate species for CO2 photoreduction (Fig. 7k). ZnO nanoparticles and nanorods with limited defects possess weak CO2 adsorption capability, resulting in inferior CO2 photoconversion activity.

Besides the VO and VZn defects, sulfur vacancy (VS) can be easily formed in the ZnS catalyst, which can also influence the CO2 photoreduction activity. Yanagida et al. synthesized quantized nanocrystalline ZnS with a low concentration of defects.69 They found that the presence of defects is crucial for efficient CO2 conversion into formate because surface defects can serve as the separation centers to decrease the recombination and simultaneously enhance CO2 adsorption. Additionally, surface defects can also influence the reaction pathways of CO2 reduction. The increased concentration of VS defects in ZnS has little impact on the catalytic activity, but can change product selectivity between CO and formate; meanwhile, the decreased VS can lead to enhanced catalytic activity for the formate production.70,71 The influence mechanism of VS on the product selectivity can be explained using the scheme shown in Fig. 8a and b. Upon UV-light illumination, the generated electrons in ZnS migrate to the adsorbed CO2, leading to the formation of  on the Zn atom. Subsequently, the formed  is attacked by a weakly adsorbed hydrogen atom to form HCOOH on a surface with a low density of surface VS. However, the population of adsorbed hydrogen atoms will decrease in the vicinity of  when the density of VS increases. As a result,  reacts more easily with another CO2 molecule to form a Zn2+OCOCO2 complex and is further reduced to CO.

Pang et al. successfully constructed Ni-doped colloidal ZnS nanocatalysts for CO2 reduction.72 Efficient CO2 conversion into formate can be achieved at an appropriate doping amount, and the respective apparent quantum yield (AQY) can reach 59.1% and 5.6% at wavelengths of 340 and 420 nm. This is because a large amount of VS defects in the pristine ZnS nanocrystals can result in severe charge recombination and decrease the activity, while the Ni doping tends to localize the electrons from VS and reduce the amount of VS, leading to enhanced charge carrier separation. Doping with a small amount of Ni leads to abundant VS defects, while doping with a large amount of Ni causes the loss of some VS defects. Thus, only an appropriate doping amount can achieve optimal CO2 reduction activity. Similar to that for ZnO, cation vacancy (VZn) can also act as catalytically active sites.73 VZn-rich well-crystalline ZnS was prepared by acid etching, and the selectivity of formate production can reach 85% in aqueous solution without a cocatalyst. The free energy configuration is calculated to reveal the effect of VZn on the CO2 reduction kinetics (Fig. 8c–e). Free energy calculation for the CO2 reduction pathways is carried out on the surface of pure and defect-containing ZnS, respectively. The ZnS surface with VZn is not as favorable as the pure one for hydrogen production. Moreover, the formation of COO−* and HCOO* intermediates is crucial for efficient CO2 reduction to formate over ZnS. The activation barrier for the formation of the COO−* intermediate can be greatly decreased in the presence of VZn on the surface, which can facilitate the entire photocatalytic CO2 reduction process. The VZn-rich surface of ZnS can greatly hinder the proton adsorption too, which is the origin of the high selectivity for CO2 reduction in competition with H2 generation.
It should be mentioned that various types of vacancy defect may co-exist in a semiconductor, while which vacancy plays a dominant role in the improved photocatalytic activity is still an open question. More importantly, considering the competition of H2 evolution, it is necessary to gain deep understanding of how the vacancy defects affect the CO2 photoreduction selectivity. Li and coworkers prepared ZnS nanoplates respectively with dominant VS and VZn–VS–VZn defects via annealing a ZnS(en)0.5 precursor in Ar and air.74 It was found that ZnS nanoplates with more VS defects exhibit superior photocatalytic activity and selectivity for CO than those with dominant VZn–VS–VZn (Fig. 9a). The influence of defects on CO2 reduction was thoroughly studied by various techniques. The photocurrent response and time-resolved fluorescence decay curves show that VS defects can facilitate the separation of charge carriers (Fig. 9b and c). TPD curves of CO2 and in situ DRIFTS results reveal that VS defects are favorable for the adsorption and activation of CO2 and play a crucial role in the enhanced catalytic solar fuel production (Fig. 9d–f).

4 Surface functionalization
Surface functionalization (such as grafting amine functional groups, loading cocatalysts, etc.) is also a valid means to regulate the performance of CO2 reduction. Liao et al. synthesized amine-functionalized ZnO nanocatalysts through a facile hydrothermal approach by using monoethanolamine.75 The terminal amine groups on the ZnO surface can significantly promote the chemisorption and effective activation of CO2, and thus enhance the activity of CO2 photoreduction.
Loading an appropriate cocatalyst on the nanocatalysts can effectively accelerate the surface chemical reaction. Serrano et al. explored various morphology modification strategies to improve the performance of ZnO catalysts.76 N-doping seems to have little impact on the photocatalysis, while deposited Cu can serve as a cocatalyst and suppress the charge recombination, leading to enhanced photocatalytic efficiency. Baran et al. reported the synthesis of ZnS nanocatalysts functionalized with Ru nanoparticles for CO2 photoreduction.46 The deposited Ru particles can improve CO2 adsorption and lower the CO2 activation energy. Meanwhile, Ru nanoparticles serve as an “electron sink” to increase the lifetime of charge carriers. Introduction of a cocatalyst can simultaneously enhance the photocatalytic performance and target product selectivity. Meng et al. performed CO2 photoreduction over a ZnS colloid.77 The activity is enhanced by 1–2 orders of magnitude via regulating the reaction solvent and loading an appropriate cocatalyst. In an optimal case, a selectivity of 95% for HCOOH production with 76% AQY at a wavelength of 280 nm can be achieved over a Cd2+ modified ZnS colloid. Furthermore, two functional elements, Cu+ and Cd2+, were simultaneously modified on the surface of ZnS for selective CO2 photoreduction.78 The photocatalytic results reveal that ZnS can show a visible-light photoresponse with Cu+ doping, and the selectivity for HCOOH production can reach as high as 99% with simultaneous Cd2+ modification (Fig. 10a–c). The fluorescence spectra indicate that Cd2+ effectively hinders the recombination of photogenerated charge carries (Fig. 10d), which is further supported by theoretical calculation. DFT results clarify that the s orbital of Cd has a much higher density of states (DOS) near the band edge than that of the Zn s orbital, which is favorable for the charge transfer from the CB of ZnS to the existing surface states generated by Cd2+ (Fig. 10e). As a result, high CO2 reduction activity and high selectivity for HCOOH generation can be achieved.

5 Multicomponent zinc chalcogenides
The wide spectral response and appropriate CB/VB potential are crucial for a semiconductor to exhibit high photocatalytic activity. Downshifting the CB level or upshifting the VB level of a semiconductor can narrow the bandgap so as to achieve high light harvesting performance; meanwhile, the redox driving force is weakened. So the contradiction between the good light harvesting and strong redox power seems inevitable. In this regard, formation of solid solutions can be a valid composition-engineering strategy to minimize this contradiction.79–83 Compared to the pristine binary zinc chalcogenides, ternary zinc chalcogenides possess some distinct strengths of tunable band structure and visible-light absorption. As a result, the CO2 photoreduction performance can be significantly enhanced.
Tang et al. prepared band structure-tunable ZnxCd1−xS solid solution nanospheres for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.84 It is found that the reduction product selectivity can be influenced by the composition of the obtained solid solutions. The major products of CO2 reduction are CH3OH and CH3CHO in water with x = 0.2 and 0.5, while C2H5OH can also be detected over the Zn0.8Cd0.2S sample. Kozlova et al. reported that the activity of Cd1−xZnxS photocatalysts increases as the Cd molar fraction increases, originating from the improved visible-light absorption.85 The Cd0.94Zn0.06S photocatalyst exhibits the highest activity, with a yield of 2.9 μmol g−1 h−1 CO and 0.22 μmol g−1 h−1 CH4. Besides the ZnxCd1−xS solid solutions, Li et al. synthesized ZnS1−xSex nanobelt solid solutions via annealing the ZnS1−xSex(en)0.5 precursor.86 As the Se/S ratio increases, the bandgap of the obtained ZnS1−xSex can be tailored from 3.69 to 2.68 eV. Benefiting from the optimized balance between the efficient light harvesting and appropriate reduction potential, the ZnS0.75Se0.25 sample shows the best performance for CO2 photoreduction among all the ZnS1−xSex solid solutions.
ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) is also a promising ternary zinc chalcogenide photocatalyst with a direct-bandgap value of 2.06–2.85 eV, owing to its good visible-light response and photoelectric properties, environmental benignity, low cost, and facile synthesis.87–89 Moreover, its CB potential is negative enough for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. ZIS nanosheets with different crystal (hexagonal and cubic) structures were used for CO2 photoreduction.90 Under visible-light irradiation, a methyl formate yield of 762.36 and 629.62 μmol g−1 is achieved after 4 h illumination in pure methanol over hexagonal and cubic ZIS, respectively. Here methanol plays multiple roles in the CO2 photoreduction, as the absorbent for concentrating CO2, sacrificial agent for the photogenerated holes, and reactant that can esterify the produced formic acid. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is used to study the charge separation. A weaker PL emission intensity of the hexagonal ZnIn2S4 nanosheets indicates their higher charge separation efficiency than that of cubic ZnIn2S4. Moreover, the CB potential of hexagonal ZnIn2S4 is more negative than that of cubic ZnIn2S4, implying higher reduction power of ZnIn2S4. This accounts for the higher methyl formate production of the hexagonal ZnIn2S4.
Jiao et al. successfully synthesized one-unit-cell ZIS atomic layers (Fig. 11a).91 ZIS with abundant VZn defects exhibits a CO yield of 33.2 μmol g−1 h−1, which is about 3.6 times higher than that with a small amount of VZn. This is because a large amount of VZn defects not only greatly facilitates the charge separation, but also leads to increased light absorption, high CO2 adsorption capacity, and strong surface hydrophilicity (Fig. 11b). In addition, 3D hierarchical ZIS with VZn was prepared via a solvothermal route by He et al.92 The CO2 photoreduction efficiency of ZIS with abundant VZn is 19 times higher than that of the bulk ZIS. The greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity is described as “hitting three birds with one stone”. First, the introduction of numerous VZn defects can expand the light-harvesting range and greatly accelerate the separation and transport of charge carriers. More importantly, CO2 can be activated by VZn active sites, facilitating the formation of key intermediates. Additionally, VZn is also beneficial for the formation of surface hydroxyl groups, which may play a key role in the CO2 photoreduction.

Besides the ternary zinc chalcogenides, quaternary zinc chalcogenide catalysts for CO2 photoreduction have also been investigated. Zeng et al. reported the synthesis of quaternary flower-like ZnxCa1−xIn2S solid solutions via a one-pot hydrothermal approach (Fig. 11c).93 With the increase of Ca2+ ratio, the photoresponse edge of ZnxCa1−xIn2S gradually red-shifts and the corresponding bandgap (Eg) continuously narrows (Fig. 11d). Simultaneously, the CB level first upshifts and then downshifts, and the most negative potential is obtained over the Zn0.4Ca0.6In2S4 sample (Fig. 11e). The photocatalytic CO2 reduction results demonstrate that the yield of CH4 and CO over the Zn0.4Ca0.6In2S4 sample can reach 0.877 and 0.224 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively, which is much higher than that over the pure ZnIn2S4 and CaIn2S4 samples (Fig. 11f and g). Furthermore, similar phenomena can also be observed in the ZnxCd1−xIn2S solid solutions.93
6 Heterojunction fabrication
As discussed above, simultaneously possessing good light harvesting ability and strong redox power for a single semiconductor photocatalyst is still a big challenge. Heterojunction fabrication is an effective means to improve the catalytic performance due to the tunable band structure and facilitated separation of charge carriers,94–96 and is mainly classified into type II heterojunction, p–n junction, and Z-scheme heterojunction in the field of CO2 photoreduction (Fig. 12).
 Fig. 12  Diagram of charge transfer in different types of heterojunction: (a) type II, (b) p–n, and (c) Z-scheme. 
6.1 Type-II heterojunction
As shown in Fig. 12a, S1 and S2 with a suitable alignment of energy levels are closely combined together, resulting in the formation of a type II heterojunction. Upon light illumination, the photogenerated holes from the VB of S2 will transfer to those of S1, while the photogenerated electrons from the CB of S1 will transfer to that of S2. Accordingly, the charge separation can be greatly promoted owing to the unique staggered band structure in the type II heterojunction. For instance, Zhang et al. reported a methanol production rate of 1581 μmol g−1 h−1 from the CO2 photoreduction over ZnSe/ZnO, which is much higher than those of pure CdS (503.88 μmol g−1 h−1) and ZnO (763.9 μmol g−1 h−1) owing to the facilitated separation of charge carriers by the formation of a type II heterojunction.97 Zhang et al. fabricated a CdS/ZnO heterojunction via a facile two-step hydrothermal approach.98 The obtained CdS/ZnO shows good CO2 photoconversion efficiency in the absence of sacrificial agents and cocatalysts, which is 11 times higher than that of the pristine CdS under visible-light illumination. The boosted photocatalytic activity is mainly attributed to the good light absorption of CdS, the promoted CO2 activation on the ZnO surface, and efficient charge separation originating from the type II heterojunction.
6.2 The p–n junction
The p–n junction can also be fabricated to improve the charge separation.94 Owing to the difference of Fermi levels between the p-type and n-type photocatalysts, the electrons in the n-type semiconductor tend to diffuse toward the p-type semiconductor through the p–n interface, leaving behind the positively charged species, while the holes in the p-type semiconductor tend to migrate to the n-type semiconductor, leaving behind the negatively charged species (Fig. 12b). As a consequence, an internal electric field with the direction from the n-type to the p-type semiconductor is formed at the interface. The charge separation can be efficiently separated under resultant built-in electric field in this p–n junction structure.
Recently, construction of the p–n junction using zinc chalcogenide photocatalysts has drawn great attention. Chen et al. reported the fabrication of ZnO/NiO porous hollow spheres via the thermal treatment of bimetallic organic frameworks.99 The n-type ZnO and p-type NiO can mix homogeneously and have intimate contact with each other via the decomposition of a heterothallic Zn–Ni MOF precursor. The formation of plenty of p–n junctions can enhance the charge separation and thus significantly boost the photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction. Similarly, p-type CuO nanowires/n-type ZnO islands were successfully prepared by using atomic layer deposition.100 Both CuO and ZnO surfaces can serve as active sites for water oxidation and CO2 reduction. The highest CO2 conversion performance is obtained when ZnO islands are just impinging on each other and the island perimeter length maximizes. Iqbal et al. prepared a ZnO/Cu2O p–n heterostructure by selectively photodepositing Cu2O on the tips of ZnO nanorods.101 In addition, ZnO/ZnTe heterostructured nanorod arrays were prepared by a one-step electrodeposition method.102 The photocatalytic results from both systems indicate that the heterostructures are more efficient than the pristine ZnO nanorods, due to the boosted charge generation, separation and transport originating from the formation of the p–n junction. A ZnTe/ZnO heterostructure was also synthesized via a one-pot hydrothermal method, and it shows high activity for CO2 reduction with a ZnTe atomic percentage of ∼3.35% under visible-light illumination.103 Fahad et al. synthesized a ZnTe/SrTiO3 cage-like structure and ZnTe/TiO2 coral-like structure via a hydrothermal method, which exhibit higher CO2 photoreduction activity than the corresponding single counterparts.104,105 Moreover, there is an optimal ratio in the heterostructure to obtain the best CO2 photoconversion performance.
6.3 Z-scheme heterojunction
Designing and fabricating a Z-scheme heterojunction is another strategy to boost CO2 photoreduction efficiency.106–109 Typically, the band structure of the Z-scheme is similar to that of the type II heterojunction. The difference lies in the transfer directions of photogenerated charge carriers across the interface (Fig. 12c). In a Z-scheme heterojunction, unlike the type II one, the photoexcited electrons from the CB of S1 can recombine with the photogenerated holes in the VB of S2. As a result, the strong reduction power of electrons and strong oxidation power of holes are preserved in different regions of the heterostructure. So the photocatalytic performance can be greatly improved.
So far, some Z-scheme heterojunctions based on zinc chalcogenide catalysts have been investigated to achieve high CO2 photoconversion efficiency. A Z-scheme ZnO/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/UiO-66-NH2 heterojunction was fabricated via a solvothermal approach.110 The obtained ZnO/rGO/UiO-66-NH2 heterojunction can achieve efficient charge separation originating from Z-scheme charge transfer. As a consequence, the CO2 photoconversion into CH3OH and HCOOH is significantly enhanced. Zubair et al. reported a highly efficient hybrid Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS)–ZnO photocatalyst with good stability.111 A CH4 production rate of 138.90 ppm g−1 h−1 can be achieved over the optimum CZTS–ZnO sample, which is 31 and 22 times higher than those of pure ZnO nanorods and CZTS nanoparticles, respectively. The enhanced performance can be attributed to the promoted light harvesting and accelerated separation of the photogenerated charge carriers based on the Z-scheme mechanism. Nie et al. prepared polydopamine (PDA)-modified ZnO microspheres via a self-assembly method.112 The increased light utilization and charge transfer efficiency result in efficient CO2 photoreduction. The in situ XPS results verify the direct Z-scheme mechanism of charge transfer in the PDA/ZnO heterojunction. In addition, a g-C3N4/ZnO Z-scheme heterojunction was prepared via an electrostatic self-assembly approach.113 Intimate interface contact between g-C3N4 and ZnO is achieved via simply utilizing the opposite surface charge. Compared with bare g-C3N4 and ZnO, g-C3N4/ZnO shows greatly improved activity for CO2 photoreduction to CH3OH, which originates from the efficient charge transfer of the g-C3N4/ZnO Z-scheme heterojunction. Similarly, Yu et al. prepared a g-C3N4/ZnO photocatalyst via a one-pot synthesis procedure.114 Hydroxyl radical analysis confirms the validity of direct Z-scheme charge transfer, leading to the boosted photocatalytic activity by a factor of 2.3 in comparison with pristine g-C3N4.
Although the physical method is a facile and convenient approach to combine two semiconductors together to construct the Z-scheme heterojunction, the chemical method is believed to be a more effective strategy because of the much more stable and intimate interface formed via chemical bonding. In situ oxidation is one approach to achieve in situ growth of one semiconductor on another. For instance, Li et al. prepared ZnS@ZnO via in situ growth of ZnO on the surface of ZnS by facile air-assisted annealing of a ZnS(en)0.5 precursor.115 The composition of the ZnS@ZnO core–shell structure can be adjusted by changing the calcination time (Fig. 13a). The Z-scheme charge transfer is verified by using the experimental results of ESR and PL (Fig. 13b and c). The intimate contact at the interface and interfacial defects (like ZnSxO1−x) caused by in situ growth with common Zn cations play a key role in the enhanced charge transfer. As a result, the obtained ZnS@ZnO nanostructures exhibit superior CO2 reduction activity to ZnS.

In situ cation-exchange is another method to achieve in situ growth of one semiconductor on another via an interface chemical reaction. Recently, Z-scheme ZnSe/CdSe composites were fabricated by preferential growth of CdSe nanoparticles on the polyhedral-shaped surface of ZnSe nanoparticles via the cation-exchange method (Fig. 13d and e).116 The obtained ZnSe/CdSe composites significantly boost the photocatalytic activity of pristine ZnSe (Fig. 13f), with an optimal CO yield of 116.9 μmol g−1 at an optimized loading of CdSe (Cd/Zn = 0.125:1), which is 33.4 times that of ZnSe (3.5 μmol g−1). ESR and DFT calculations can prove the Z-scheme charge transfer at the interface of ZnSe/CdSe composites, in which the efficient utilization of charge carriers with strong redox power is simultaneously achieved (Fig. 13f and g). Moreover, enhanced light absorption due to the narrow-bandgap CdSe and increased CO2 adsorption induced by the Se vacancy generated upon in situ growth can also account for the remarkably improved CO2 reduction activity.
7 Hybridization with molecular catalysts
As is known, it usually takes a large amount of energy to reduce the highly stable CO2 molecule. Generally, a much more negative potential of −1.90 V is needed for the formation of the initial anion radical via single electron reduction. It is noted that the molecular catalysts are beneficial for the multi-electron charge transfer, and thus have been widely investigated for CO2 reduction.117–124 Moreover, molecular catalysts usually exhibit much higher activity and selectivity than their inorganic counterparts. However, molecular catalysts often exhibit poor stability and inferior light harvesting ability, which limit their real applications. In contrast, semiconductors usually show good durability and light absorption, but inferior catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction. So semiconductor/molecular catalyst hybrid systems can possess the strength of both molecular catalysts and semiconductors, and thus provide a promising solution to develop CO2 reduction systems with high performance.125–130 In such hybrid systems, the semiconductor acts as a sensitizer and the molecular catalyst is the catalytic center, i.e., electrons transfer from the CB of the semiconductor to the molecular catalyst. Accordingly, the charge generation can be perfectly separated from surface catalytic reactions, and thus significantly boost the photocatalytic activity.
Zn-based sulfides are promising in semiconductor/molecular catalysts for efficient CO2 reduction owing to the relatively negative CB, which facilitates charge transfer between the semiconductor and molecular catalyst. Suzuki et al. prepared hybrid systems coupling various Zn-based sulfides (i.e., (AgIn)0.22Zn1.56S2, (CuGa)0.8Zn0.4S2 and Ni-doped ZnS) with different Ru-complex catalysts for the CO2 photoreduction.131 Ni-doped ZnS and (AgIn)0.22Zn1.56S2 combined with a Ru-complex incorporating a phosphonate ligand [Ru(4,4′-diphosphonate-2,2′-bipyridine)(CO)2Cl2] exhibit enhanced HCOOH production and stability. In addition, Kuehnel et al. reported a hybrid system synthesized via the combination of visible-light responsive ZnSe quantum dots (QDs) with a functionalized Ni(cyclam) catalyst for CO2 photoreduction.132 ZnSe QDs act as light absorbers (i.e., photosensitizers), and Ni(cyclam) plays the role of catalytic center for CO2 reduction (Fig. 14). The hybrid combining a phosphonic acid functionalized Ni(cyclam) (NiCycP) exhibits high activity for CO production (TON > 120), while Ni(cyclam)Cl2 without functionalization produces three times less CO (Fig. 14a and b). Further modifying ZnSe with 2-(dimethylamino)ethanethiol can partially suppress hydrogen evolution and enhance the CO generation. As a result, a selectivity > 33% and TON > 280 for CO production over hydrogen evolution are achieved (Fig. 14c and d). Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy was used to reveal the electron transfer kinetics in the ZnSe/NiCycP hybrid system. The photoinduced absorption at about 470 and 590 nm within 2 ps of excitation can be observed for pure ZnSe. The positive features at 470 and 590 nm disappear in the presence of ascorbic acid. This broad bleach is ascribed to the trapped photoelectrons (Fig. 14e). In the presence of ascorbic acid and NiCycP (Fig. 14f), the recovery of bleach at 550 nm due to trapped electrons is clearly accelerated (Fig. 14g). Such transient absorption spectral results indicate that the fast hole scavenging and electron trapping occur in ZnSe QDs upon bandgap excitation. The electron transfer from ZnSe to NiCycP is in the ps timescale. Such fast electron transfer dynamics is crucial for achieving high CO2 reduction performance over the ZnSe/NiCycP hybrid system.

Besides the Ru and Ni molecular catalysts, Lian et al. reported hybrid catalysts of CuInS2/ZnS QDs with a meso-tetraphenylporphyrin iron(III) chloride (FeTPP) catalyst (Fig. 15a).133 The TON for CO production of the obtained CuInS2/ZnS/FeTPP system is 18 times higher than that of the system with a fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium sensitizer using 450 nm light (Fig. 15b). The electron transfers of FeIIITPP → FeIITPP and FeIITPP → FeITPP generally occur in the range of less than 200 fs. The high photocatalytic efficiency is ascribed to this ultrafast electron transfer from the CuInS2/ZnS QDs to FeTPP (Fig. 15c). To further promote the interactions between the semiconductor and FeTPP, FeTCPP with –COOH group modification was synthesized. Li et al. combined the ZnxCd1−xS solid solution with tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin iron(III) chloride (FeTCPP) for the CO2 photoreduction.134 The optimal hybrid photocatalyst (atom ratio of Zn:Cd = 0.25:0.75) produces 1.28 μmol of CO after 4 h reaction, with a selectivity of 93%, exhibiting much higher activity than the ZnxCd1−xS solid solutions. This is because the presence of VS and Zn atoms facilitates efficient interfacial electron transfer from ZnxCd1−xS solid solutions to FeTCPP.

8 Conclusions and perspectives
In summary, this review presents the recent progress in CO2 photoreduction based on zinc chalcogenide nanocatalysts. It is encouraging that great achievements have been made in developing zinc chalcogenide-based materials, especially those with a controlled size, morphology, and crystal structure. The CO2 photoreduction activity of zinc chalcogenide-based catalysts can be greatly enhanced with various strategies like microstructure modulation, surface functionalization, formation of solid solutions, heterojunction fabrication, and hybridization with molecular catalysts, due to the facilitation in generation/separation/migration of the holes and electrons and/or adsorption/activation of the CO2 molecule.
However, the real application of zinc chalcogenide-based photocatalysts is still facing challenges, not just in terms of the low activity, but also the low selectivity of the target product, as photocatalytic CO2 reduction is a complicated process. Although tremendous effort has been made to develop photocatalysts for efficient CO2 reduction, the conversion efficiency is still far below 1%. A multiple-proton coupled multiple-electron transfer process is involved in CO2 reduction, leading to the simultaneous formation of various products like CO, CH3OH and CH4. Furthermore, the hydrogen evolution is an inevitable competitive reaction in the aqueous solution. In addition, the separation of various products and photocorrosion of the catalysts are two other big challenges for the real application.
Future developments are desperately needed and more effort can be devoted to the following aspects. Firstly, the majority of current photocatalytic systems usually focus on the isolated reduction half reactions and employ a sacrificial reagent for the oxidation half reaction. Though this is beneficial for improving photocatalytic performance via suppressing the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes and gaining scientific insights into the CO2 reduction as it is not necessary to consider the oxidation half reactions, the photogenerated holes are not effectively utilized for something good like production of value-added chemicals or removal of pollutants. Or, H2O would be the hole scavenger, if one has to use sacrificial reagents. Actually in this case the useful O2 or H2O2 can be produced via H2O oxidation. Thus, more efforts should be devoted to developing multifunctional catalysts for both half reactions, i.e., efficient utilization of both electrons (for CO2 reduction) and holes (such as for water oxidation). Secondly, most of the zinc chalcogenide-based catalysts suffer from relatively poor stability during photocatalysis in the aqueous solution. A surface protection layer can thus be introduced to substantially improve the stability, which can be prepared by various techniques like sputter deposition and atomic layer deposition. However, the quality of the surface protection layer (such as thickness and porosity) should be optimized since it may decrease the light absorption and/or block the reactions, leading to low photocatalytic activity. Thirdly, although the Z-scheme design seems promising for CO2 photoreduction, the mechanism remains largely unclear and is still an open question in some sense. Theoretical simulation based on first-principles calculations combined with experimental results should be simultaneously performed to provide an overall picture of the photocatalytic reactions. Fourthly, as is always expected, it is significant and meaningful to use theoretical calculations for the R&D of efficient photocatalysts, especially the high-throughput screening based on the Materials Genome Initiative. The high-throughput computation can help rationally design the catalysts and optimize reaction pathways, leading to enhanced activity and selectivity. Last but not least, the hybrids that couple semiconductors with molecular catalysts can provide a potential opportunity for mimicking natural photosynthesis with high efficiency and selectivity. However, the study in this area is still in its infant stage, especially the compatibility between molecular catalysts and semiconductors, which is critical to the charge transfer. Although the utilization of bridging ligands is beneficial for the interfacial charge transfer, some detrimental effects also take place due to the extended electron transfer distance and inadequate stability of ligands. Hence, unique and effective interfacial modification strategies are highly expected in the near future. We envision that the continuous and ever-growing investigation in this field can facilitate the development of photocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction with high performance.
