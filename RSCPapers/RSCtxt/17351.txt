    , Accepted 5th September 2018First published on 5th September 2018AbstractIn the present work, an improved hot injection technique, namely microwave-assisted hot injection, for mass production of Mn2+-doped CsPbCl3 (Mn2+:CsPbCl3) perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) was reported. This strategy combines the advantages of both microwave irradiation and hot injection, which represents characteristics such as homogeneous heating and rapid production of Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs with a homogeneous size distribution. Meanwhile, it exhibits the capacity for gram-scale synthesis of Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs. The Mn2+ doping concentrations can be facilely tailored by controlling the reaction temperatures and feed ratios of the MnCl2 precursor, resulting in their enhanced optical properties with a PL QY up to 65%, which is the highest among the Mn2+-doped perovskite NCs ever reported. The as-constructed light emitting diodes (LEDs) based on Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs emit highly bright white light, suggesting their potential applications in optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Over the past few years, the exploration of lead halide perovskite (APbX3, where A is an organic or inorganic cation and X is a halide anion) nanocrystals (NCs) has attracted enormous interest. For instance, their photo-conversion efficiencies have increased from 3.8 to 22.1%,1,2 suggesting their highly bright future for application in optoelectronic devices. To date, the all-inorganic CsPbX3 NCs are recognized as a promising alternative to II–VI and III–V semiconductors in various applications, such as light-emitting devices (LEDs),3–5 photodetectors,6–8 and solar cells.9,10 To push forward their practical applications, one of the keys is to realize the mass production of the CsPbX3 NCs with high quality and desired performance.
Among the various strategies for the synthesis of CsPbX3 NCs, the so-called hot injection is considered as the most popular one. It exhibits significant advantages for the growth of the NCs with a uniform size distribution, owing to its strictly limited time for the nucleation and growth of the NCs in a very small temperature window.11–16 However, this route encounters a great challenge to realize the large-scale preparation of the NCs, because of the intrinsic inhomogeneous heating process. In comparison, microwave (MW) irradiation holds unique advantages such as homogeneous and rapid heating,17,18 and is facile and versatile for fabricating materials in nearly all systems.19–22 However, the NCs synthesized by MW irradiation often have an unexpected large size distribution, owing to the nucleation and growth of the NCs over the whole heating and cooling process with a wide temperature window.23–26 This might be responsible for the fact that, to date, the PL QY of the as-synthesized Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs is very low (∼26%).25 That is to say, there still lacks a strategy for mass production of CsPbX3 NCs with high quality and excellent properties.
Accordingly, here, we report an improved hot injection strategy, namely microwave-assisted hot injection, to accomplish the mass production of Mn2+:CsPbCl3 perovskite NCs, which combines the advantages of both microwave irradiation and hot injection. The effect of the key parameters such as reaction temperatures and feed ratios of the raw materials on the Mn2+ doping concentration and optical properties of the Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs has been investigated systematically. In comparison to the reported Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs synthesized by other methods, the obtained counterparts grown by microwave-assisted hot injection exhibit a more homogeneous size distribution with an enhanced PL QY up to 65%, which is the highest one ever reported. Furthermore, the as-fabricated Mn2+:CsPbCl3 perovskite NCs are used as the sole material for the exploration of white-LEDs, which gives rise to a bright white light emission with CIE color coordinates of (0.32, 0.29), representing their promising applications in optoelectronic devices.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 schematically illustrates the typical preparation procedure for the growth of Mn2+:CsPbCl3 perovskite NCs via microwave-assisted hot injection. First, the solid–liquid mixtures, composed of ODE, DGBE, OA, OAm, TOP, RNH3Cl, PbCl2 and MnCl2, are completely added into a three-necked flask (Fig. 1(a)), followed by being placed in a microwave oven. When the mixtures are heated up to the given temperature, the Cs precursor is then injected (Fig. 1(b)) for the growth of Mn2+:CsPbCl3 perovskite NCs under microwave irradiation for ∼5 s (see the details in the Experimental section). The obtained product exhibits brilliant light emission under UV light (Fig. 1(c)).

Fig. 2 shows the digital photographs of the Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs obtained in one pot within 15 min (without purification) under room-light (Fig. 2(a)) and UV-light radiation (Fig. 2(b)). In this case, we scaled the reactant amounts up to 20 times in a 500 mL flask to show the scalability of the present strategy. Fig. 2(c) (under room light) and (d) (under UV light) show the corresponding collected dry powders of Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs of 1.78 g, representing that the yield is ∼57%, which is comparable to that of the previous reports.25,27 The typical TEM and HRTEM images and the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized NCs are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI,† evidencing that the obtained NCs have a homogeneous size distribution with high crystallites in spite of a substantially expanded synthesis environment. Notably, the size uniformity in the current work is superior to that (Fig. S2 in the ESI†) in the reported studies,25 in which nanocrystals are prepared by traditional microwave irradiation. Based on the discussion mentioned above, it can be concluded that our proposed strategy combines the advantages of both microwave irradiation and hot injection, which represents characteristics such as homogeneous heating and rapid production of Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs with a homogeneous size distribution.

To show the effect of reaction temperatures on the doping concentrations and optical properties of the as-synthesized NCs, the samples with an Mn/Pb molar ratio of 1:1 are prepared at 150, 170, 190 and 210 °C, leading to the growth of CsPbCl3 NCs with tailored Mn2+ concentrations (relative to Pb2+) of 3.5, 4.9, 6.5 and 16.5%, respectively. These experimental results imply that the Mn2+ incorporations are increased with the increase of reaction temperatures. Notably, the doping concentration is remarkably increased when the temperature is up to 210 °C, suggesting that the incorporation of Mn2+ into CsPbCl3 NCs is more effective at higher reaction temperatures. Fig. 3(a–d) are the corresponding TEM images for this series of Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs with tailored Mn2+ doping concentrations, disclosing that the resultant NCs all have a cubic morphology with average sizes of ∼12.6, 13.5, 14.1 and 16.0 nm, respectively (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The bottom right insets are their corresponding photographs under UV light (365 nm), disclosing their excellent PL properties. Fig. 3(e) shows the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the sample prepared at 190 °C, in which the lattice fringe with an interplanar spacing of 3.96 Å coincides with the (101) plane of tetragonal CsPbCl3. Both the HRTEM image and SAED pattern (Fig. 3(f)) reveal that the as-grown Mn2+:CsPbCl3 nanocubes are single crystalline. Furthermore, with respect to the (101) plane diffraction (Fig. 4), a 0.1° shift toward a higher angle is clearly observed as the reaction temperature increases. This verifies the lattice contraction of the Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs, attributed to the substitution of larger Pb2+ ions (133 pm) by smaller Mn2+ ones (97 pm).28

Fig. 5(a and b) show the absorption and PL spectra of this series of Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs obtained at different reaction temperatures. It seems that the NCs synthesized at 150 °C (i.e., with a low doping concentration of 3.5% Mn2+) have an absorption band peaked at ∼402 nm, which would be gradually shifted to 384 nm when Mn2+ concentrations are increased up to 16.5%. This is mainly attributed to the effect of Mn2+ alloying with the host CsPbCl3,15 instead of the quantum confinement, because the diameters of these NCs exceed the Bohr exciton diameter (∼5 nm) for CsPbCl3.29 The PL spectra of these Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs all exhibit two peaks at ∼405 and ∼600 nm, respectively (Fig. 5(b)). The blue-violet PL band can be ascribed to the band-edge emission of the CsPbCl3 host, which has a very narrow (∼12 nm) full width at half maximum (FWHM). Meanwhile, the red PL band with a larger FWHM (88–99 nm) should be assigned to the internal electron transition of Mn2+ from the first excited state of 4T1 to the ground state of 6A1, which can be confirmed by the long excited-state lifetime (typically on the millisecond scale) (Fig. 5(c)).12,30–32 The excitation spectra of the red emission in Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs (Fig. S4 in the ESI†) closely follow their absorption spectrum, implying the energy transfer from the photo-excited CsPbCl3 host to the Mn2+.12,29,33,34 The band edge emission in Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs is distinctively different from that in traditional Mn2+-doped II–VI NCs, mainly due to their relatively slower energy-transfer process (often on the nanosecond scale)13 than that in Mn2+-doped II–VI NCs (often on the tens of picoseconds scale).35,36 As a result, the Mn2+ emission as well as the band edge emission coexist in Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs, while only Mn2+ emission is detected in the traditional Mn2+-doped II–VI NCs.

Fig. 5(c) shows the time-resolved Mn2+ emission decay curves of these Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs. It suggests that single-exponential PL decay is observed in Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs synthesized at low temperatures (i.e., with low Mn2+ concentrations). However, double exponential is required for the NCs synthesized at a high temperature of 210 °C (i.e., with a Mn2+ concentration of 16.5%). The average lifetimes are reduced from 1.76 to 1.52 ms with the increase of Mn2+ concentrations (see Table S1 in the ESI†). It is known that the Mn2+ emission decay characteristic reflects only the relaxation process of the Mn2+ excited state (4T1) without the energy-transfer process. Thus, the double-exponential decay indicates a non-uniform distribution of Mn2+ in the NCs. It should be related to the changing of the crystal field environment of Mn2+, mainly due to the different ionic radius of Pb2+ and Mn2+, especially at a higher Mn2+ doping concentration.37,38

Fig. 5(d) shows the PL QYs of the Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs synthesized at various temperatures. It discloses that their PL QYs increase and reach a maximum value of 65% for the NCs obtained at the reaction temperature of 190 °C (i.e., with an Mn2+ concentration of 6.5%), and then decrease with the further increase of Mn2+ concentrations (Fig. 5(d)). It is generally considered that the Mn2+ emission QY is dependent not only on the internal QY of Mn2+ d–d radiative decay, but also on the efficiency of energy transfer from the host to the dopant.32,39 The increase of the Mn2+ PL QY first with the increase of Mn2+ concentrations is mainly due to the enhanced probability of energy transfer from the CsPbCl3 host exciton to Mn2+ when more Mn2+ is incorporated, which is consistent with the decreased ratio of CsPbCl3 host emission in the samples with higher Mn2+ concentrations (Fig. 5(b)). When the Mn2+ doping concentration exceeds 6.5%, the PL QY exhibits a drop trend, and the Mn2+ emission lifetime decreases with the increase of Mn2+ concentrations, accompanied by a PL red shift,40 which could be mainly attributable to the formed Mn2+–Mn2+ pair and enhanced energy migration to traps at elevated Mn2+ concentrations.12,34,41,42 It is worth noting that the PL QY of 65% (obtained from a mean value from several data and the used average decay factor of the filter shown in Fig. S5 and S6 in the ESI,† respectively) in the current work is the highest record of Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs ever reported, as shown in Table S2 in the ESI.†
To further disclose the growth of Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs synthesized by the microwave-assisted hot injection strategy, different feed ratios of Mn/Pb (i.e., 0.2/1, 0.5/1, 1/1, 1.5/1, 2/1 and 3/1) are introduced, corresponding to the Mn2+ concentrations (relative to Pb2+) tailored from 0.9% to 32.5% with the Mn/Pb molar ratios adjusted from 0.2/1 to 3/1 (see Table S3 in the ESI†). That is to say, in terms of the experimental results discussed above, the Mn2+ doping levels could be effectively tailored by adjusting the Mn/Pb ratios and reaction temperatures. Fig. S7 in the ESI† provides the typical TEM images of these samples with different feed ratios of Mn/Pb. It seems that all the obtained NCs exhibit a cubic morphology, and their average sizes are ∼17.1, 14.6, 14.1, 11.6, 10.5 and 11.5 nm, respectively (Fig. S8 in the ESI†). The bottom right insets in Fig. S7 in the ESI† are the corresponding HRTEM images of the as-synthesized Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs. The corresponding lattice fringes and XRD patterns (Fig. S9 in the ESI†) indicate their highly crystalline nature. Furthermore, the shift of the XRD (101) peak toward a higher angle like in Fig. 4 is also observed, suggesting the incorporation of Mn2+ dopants within the NCs. The top right insets in Fig. S7 in the ESI† present their corresponding photographs under UV light (365 nm), showing the strong PL emission of all samples. Fig. 6 shows the PL and time-resolved Mn2+ PL decay curves as well as PL QYs of this series of Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs. It is disclosed that with the increase of Mn/Pb ratios, the optical properties show a similar trend to those by varying the temperatures. The red PL peaks show a large FWHM (83–93 nm) and exhibit a long PL lifetime of 1.34–1.86 ms (Fig. 6(b) and Table S4 in the ESI†). The total PL QYs first exhibit an increase followed by reaching a maximum value of 65% at the dopant concentration of 6.5%, and then decrease with the further increase of the Mn/Pb feed ratios, which is similar to the samples prepared at different reaction temperatures.

To investigate the luminescence dynamics of Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs in more detail, temperature-dependent PL is also studied. Fig. 7 presents steady-state and time-resolved PL data for Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs (prepared at 190 °C with the Mn/Pb feed ratio of 1/1), which are collected as a function of temperatures from 80 to 400 K. It seems that the PL intensities of the exciton decrease with the increase of the temperatures, while those of the Mn2+ exhibit the opposite trend (Fig. 7(a) and Table S6 in the ESI†). Such an inverse correlation of these two intensities, especially in regard to the increased Mn2+ PL intensities at high temperatures, suggests that the Mn2+ PL emission should be related to the temperature-dependent energy transfer from the photo-excited CsPbCl3 host to the Mn2+ dopants. In this case, the exciton recombination is more efficient at low temperatures. However, at elevated temperatures, the exciton recombination is limited, and the energy transfer to Mn2+ becomes more competitive, leading to the increase in Mn2+ PL intensity with the increase of the temperatures as observed experimentally.15 Meanwhile, a blue shift of the Mn2+ PL peaks is observed with the increase of the temperatures (see Table S5 in the ESI†), which could be mainly ascribed to the decreased crystal-field strength induced by thermal expansion of the host lattice43 and the thermal activation of vibronic hot bands. Furthermore, with the increase of the temperatures, the PL decays become faster gradually but always remain in single-exponential form (Fig. 7(b) and Table S5 in the ESI†), which is regarded as an intrinsic characterization of Mn2+ in the CsPbCl3 lattice.15

Fig. 8 displays a white light LED lamp fabricated by coating Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NC/PDMS composites outside the violet LED (365 nm), followed by evaporation of chloroform. The luminescence spectrum of the as-fabricated white LED under 80 mA current is provided in Fig. 8(a). The top left inset in Fig. 8(a) shows the optical photograph of the white LED, indicating that the as-prepared Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs can effectively convert the emission of the LED chip to a white light emission with high brightness. The luminous efficacy of the LED was calculated to be 0.8 lm W−1. It is in agreement with ref. 25, in which the LED device was also structured with single fluorescent materials. The corresponding CIE coordinates (0.32, 0.29) are shown in Fig. 8b, disclosing the CRI and the correlated color temperatures (CCTs) are 84.9 and 6266 K, respectively, which represents the potential applications of Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs in optoelectronic devices with good photometric and chromatic performances.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated an improved hot injection technique, namely microwave-assisted hot injection, for mass production of Mn2+:CsPbCl3 perovskite NCs. This strategy combines the advantages of both microwave irradiation and hot injection, which holds characteristics such as homogeneous heating and rapid production of Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs with a homogeneous size distribution. Meanwhile, it exhibits the capacity for gram-scale synthesis of Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs with a high yield of 57%. The Mn2+ doping concentrations can be facilely tailored by controlling the reaction temperatures and feed ratios of the MnCl2 precursor, resulting in their enhanced optical properties with a PL QY up to 65%, which is the highest one among the Mn2+-doped perovskite NCs ever reported. Besides the emission of the CsPbCl3 host, the as-prepared NCs exhibit a strong Mn2+ related emission, attributed to the energy transfer of photo-induced excitons from the CsPbCl3 host to the doped Mn2+. The as-prepared Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs are further employed as a single color-converter to fabricate a white-LED on a commercially available 365 nm GaN LED chip, which emits highly bright white light with good photometric and chromatic performance, suggesting their potential applications in optoelectronic devices.
Experimental section
Materials
Cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 99.99%), lead(II) chloride (PbCl2, 99.99%), oleic acid (OA, 90%), oleylamine (OAm, 80%), trioctylphosphene (TOP, 90%), manganese chloride (MnCl2, 99%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 33.4%), octadecene (ODE, 90%), diethylene glycol butyl ether (DGBE, 98%), hexane (97%, anhydrous grade), and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) were purchased from Aldrich. All chemicals were used directly without further purification.
Preparation of OAm–HCl (RNH3Cl)
In a typical process, 10 mL OAm and 1 mL HCl were loaded in a 25 mL 3-necked flask. At 80 °C, the mixture was purged with N2 for 1 h. Then the solution was heated for 2 h at 120 °C under an N2 atmosphere, and was then stored under an inert atmosphere. While being used, the stock solution was heated again and kept at 80 °C.
Preparation of Cs-oleate
In a typical process, 0.8 g Cs2CO3, 2.4 mL OA and 30 mL ODE were loaded together into a 3-necked flask, followed by drying for 1 h at 120 °C, and then heated up to 150 °C for 30 min under an N2 atmosphere, until the Cs2CO3 was dissolved completely. Since Cs-oleate precipitates out of ODE at room-temperature, it has to be preheated to 100 °C before injection.
Synthesis of Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs
In a typical procedure, 111 mg PbCl2, different amounts of MnCl2, 13 mL ODE, 2 mL DGBE, 2 mL OA, 2 mL OAm, 2 mL TOP and 2 mL RNH3Cl were loaded in a 25 mL three-necked flask, and heated up to 190 °C with an irradiation power of 400 W under an Ar atmosphere. Then 0.85 mL Cs-oleate was injected rapidly. Consequently, the Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs were then allowed to grow for 5 s at the fixed temperatures of 150, 170, 190 and 210 °C, after which the obtained mixture was cooled down to room temperature in a water bath. The resultant products were precipitated with hexane and acetone and re-dispersed in hexane for the next use.
Fabrication of LEDs based on Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs
Commercially available GaN LED chips (365 nm, 1 W) without phosphor coating were purchased from Advanced Optoelectronic Technology Inc, China. For the preparation of the color conversion layer, the as-fabricated Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs were mixed with a curable resin, and then transferred into a vacuum chamber to remove the bubbles. After this, the mixtures were used to fill the cup-shaped void of the LED chip, followed by being cured under UV light for 2 min.
Characterization studies
The morphology, structure and composition of the obtained Mn2+:CsPbCl3 NCs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan), ICP optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Ultima 2, Horiba Jobin Yvon, France) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany). The UV-Vis measurements of the obtained NCs were performed on a UV-Vis scanning spectrophotometer (U-3900, Hitachi, Japan). The PL spectra, PL QYs and PL decay curves were recorded using a spectrometer (FluoroMax-4P, Horiba Jobin Yvon, France) equipped with a quantum-yield accessory and a time-correlated single-photon-counting (TCSPC) spectrometer. The PL decay curves were analyzed using DAS6 software. The spectrum of the LED was recorded under ambient conditions at room temperature by combining a PR-650 spectrophotometer with an integrated sphere and a computer-controlled direct current power. The color of the light was identified by the CIE (Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage 1931) calorimeter system.
