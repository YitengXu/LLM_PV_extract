    , Accepted 1st April 2021First published on 8th April 2021AbstractTo pave the way for InGaN-on-Si integrated photovoltaics, uniform and close-packed n-GaN/(Al)InGaN/p-GaN nanowire (NW) arrays with a ∼0.29 μm thick absorption segment of ∼2.35 eV energy bandgap were fabricated on a Si substrate using Ti-mask selective area growth (SAG) in a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) chamber. Instead of using thick and insulting buffer layers, this SAG process was realized by employing a 3 nm AlN/GaN: Ge buffer layer to facilitate electrical and thermal conduction between NWs and Si. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy mapping revealed the discontinuities of AlN and the embedments of GaN:Ge which contribute to a negligible resistance of the NWs-on-Si interface. AlInGaN active segment exhibits core–shell structures, which suppress nonradiative surface recombination at NW surfaces. Working of AlInGaN core–shell NW solar cells was demonstrated with improved open-circuit voltage (Voc) and higher energy conversion efficiency (η) than those reported for InGaN NW solar cells. Stable output characteristics including the Voc of 1.41 V and η of 2.46% were obtained under 30-Sun illuminations. Such NWs-on-Si devices use Si substrate as the bottom electrode. With a low series resistance of ∼1 Ω, this work paves the way to monolithically integrate MBE-SAG III-nitride devices and Si-based electronics, such as Si solar cells and CMOS devices.
1. Introduction
The monolithic integration of InGaN devices on Si is a desired approach to make full-solar-spectrum InGaN/Si multiple-band devices. Si solar cells (SCs) with a bandgap of ∼1.1 eV are ideally suited as the bottom junction of double-junction photovoltaics (PVs) or double-band photosynthesis.1 InGaN alloy can exhibit a tunable energy bandgap from ∼0.7 to 3.4 eV. Theoretical works report that such double-band PV devices exhibit an energy conversion efficiency (η) up to ∼31% under 1-sun air-mass (AM) 1.5G illumination and higher under concentrated sunlight.2,3 Using III-nitride growth temperature lower than 900 °C,4 molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is a good candidate technique for growing III-nitride alloy on industrial Si SCs.
The epitaxy of GaN-based crystals on a Si substrate and/or Si SCs can significantly lower manufacturing cost5 by eliminating the need for expensive substrates and additional integration processes such as mechanical stacking6 and wafer bonding.7,8 GaN-based planar heterostructures on Si exhibit large defect densities which limit their carrier lifetime and device efficiencies. The fundamental cause is the large lattice mismatch (∼17%) between GaN and Si. GaN-on-Si heterostructures have been widely explored using different growth methods, such as metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)9–11 and MBE.12–14 In the earlier works of MOCVD III-nitride planar heterostructures,15,16 the thickness of the AlN buffer layer was generally 200–300 nm or more. However, such thick buffer layers are generally not desirable in nitride MBE growth, due to its slower growth rate.
It also remains difficult to realize efficient In-rich InGaN planar heterostructure on lattice-matched substrates, due to phase separation,17 presence of large defect densities,18 large strain-induced polarization field, the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE),19 and relatively poor p-type conduction.20 High-efficiency InGaN SCs generally require a thick absorption segment21 with high indium composition (≳25%)22,23 corresponding to a green spectral range or longer wavelengths. Recently, significant progress has been made in growing In-rich InGaN nanowire (NW) heterostructures exhibiting effective strain relaxation.24 However, the self-organized process of spontaneously grown InGaN NWs leads to relatively large fluctuations in NW diameter, length, and position, which cause spatial composition variations, diameter-dependent variation in dopant incorporation and random gaps between NWs. Such variations degrade the material, optical and electrical properties, such as the spectral intensity and linewidth, current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and device efficiency. The selective area growth (SAG) technique enables the epitaxy of uniform GaN-based NW arrays with precisely controlled dimensions and position,25–27 which is promising to grow thick In-rich InGaN for PV applications.28–30
SAG techniques have been recently used in MOCVD for GaN-on-Si microLED technology, such as μm-scale III-nitride heterostructures31 and NWs.32 NW SAG techniques have been used in MBE to realize monolithic, full-color-tunable InGaN microLED pixels on GaN/sapphire in one single-step growth.27 However, different from MOCVD-based SAG-techniques on Si, MBE-based SAG techniques encounter a challenge to control the NW size on Si12,14,33,34 without a buffer layer.
Different from spontaneously grown NWs1 in MBE, AlN/GaN buffer layers (≳40 nm) are generally used for III-nitride MBE SAG on Si.12,33,34 However, such buffer layers act as a barrier through which tunneling probability decreases dramatically with its barrier height.35 A thinner AlN layer exhibits a smaller barrier height, which was determined to be ∼6 eV, 1.67 eV and 0.78 eV for 60 nm-thick,36 7.4 nm-thick35 and 0.7 nm-thick35 AlN layers, respectively. Using the n-Si substrate as the n-contact, A.-L. Bavencove et al. characterized vertically-aligned InGaN/GaN core/shell wire LED with AlN buffer layer in the electrical path.37 Such devices exhibit an estimated series resistance (Rs) of ∼10 Ω.37 As such, there have been no reports of MBE-based SAG techniques to use a Si substrate as the electrical contact, due to either the usage of buffer layers (≳40 nm) with a large sbarrier height or difficulty in controlling NW size on Si. The resistance of such buffer layers is a bottleneck in using MBE-based SAG techniques to realize NWs-on-Si device applications, such as NWs-on-Si vertical field-effect transistor (FETs)38 and InGaN/Si multiple-junction PVs.
For nanostructured materials and devices, such as Si nanocrystals,39 GaAs NWs,40 asymmetric nanoporous gold nanostructures,41 perovskite film SCs42 and In–Ga–Zn–O film transistors,43 their electrical, optical and/or chemical characteristics can be largely affected by defect properties of surfaces or interfacial regions. The commonly reported axial III–V NWs suffer from large nonradiative surface recombination (NSR) associated with the presence of surface states, hence exhibiting short carrier lifetime.40,44 The NSR effect leads to low fill factor (FF),45,46 large leakage current45,47,48and Voc46,49 in NW SCs as well as poor carrier injection efficiency in NW LEDs.53 Various approaches have been used to suppress NSR. With multiple thin AlGaN layers incorporated in the NW active region, the efficiency and output power of InGaN NW LEDs can be significantly improved.50,51 By employing MOCVD coaxial core–shell structure, n-GaN/i-InGaN/p-GaN single-NW SC exhibits improved Voc and FF, but still limited in Jsc (0.39 mA cm−2) and η (up to ∼0.19%) under 1-sun illumination.10,52 Taking advantages of CdS surface passivation, spontaneously grown InN NW array SCs exhibit improvements in Voc, FF, η and a reduction in the reverse leakage current.45 In our previous study, Al incorporation during the self-organized growth of a ∼70 nm-thick InGaN segment leads to a core–shell passivation structure and hence improved LED output.53 However, the incorporation of multiple AlGaN layers and creating large barriers for carrier collections are not suitable for PV applications. In this work, Al incorporation in the SAG process of a relatively thick InGaN (∼0.29 μm) segment was investigated for its effects on PV applications.
The PV output of single-junction InGaN-based NW SCs lag behind that of single-junction InGaN-based planar SCs. On GaN/sapphire and freestanding GaN substrates, Voc of 1.62–2.23 V, Jsc of 1.59–1.82 mA cm−2, FF of 52–61%, η of 0.98–1.41% were obtained from n-GaN/InGaN/p-GaN SCs grown by using MOCVD.54 Liou et al.23 have achieved Voc of 2.72–2.92 V, Jsc of 2.72–2.97 mA cm−2, FF of 61.51–74.89%, η of 4.97–5.95% from InGaN/GaN MQWs SCs grown on a SiCN/Si(1 1 1) substrate by using MOCVD. Such a large gap between NW SCs and planar SCs are attributed to a large NSR of NWs, a relatively small packing fraction55 of spontaneously grown NWs, challenges for uniform device fabrication and other issues. This work is dedicated to developing an approach of making uniform, close-packed (Al)InGaN NW-array SCs to improve the PV characteristics of NW SCs as well as paving the way for monolithic InGaN/Si multi-junction SCs.
Uniform and close-packed (Al)InGaN quaternary NW arrays were grown on a Si substrate by employing a 3 nm-thick AlN/GaN:Ge buffer layer using selective area growth. Ti-mask SAG process of such green-spectral-range p–i–n NW arrays was conducted using radio frequency (RF) plasma-assisted (PA) MBE. With the spontaneously formed the core–shell structure in AlInGaN segment,53 NWs were precisely and vertically aligned for a high packing fraction. The resulting NW SCs exhibits Voc of 1.10 V, Jsc of 3.12 mA cm−2, FF of 0.659 and η of 2.27% under 1-sun AM 1.5G illumination. Al incorporation suppresses NSR of SAG InGaN NWs and enhances the photoluminescence (PL) and PV characteristics. This work demonstrates SAG NWs-on-Si PV applications operated under 1-sun and concentrated illuminations. Under 30-sun illumination, NW SCs exhibit stable and repeatable output characteristics with the benefits of using the Si substrate as an electrical contact.
2. Experimental
2.1 Selective area growth of NW arrays on Si

Fig. 1a schematically shows SAG p–i–n NW heterostructures on patterned n-Si substrate. Nanohole-array Ti mask was fabricated on a 3 nm AlN/GaN:Ge buffer layer in which GaN:Ge layers were grown on AlN. AlN has been widely adopted as the seed layer for GaN or InGaN hetroepitaxy on Si due to its relatively small thermal expansion coefficient and well-suppressed interfacial reactions with Si. The incorporation of the GaN:Ge layer is essential for subsequent GaN-based NW epitaxy because of its functions for: (I) surface planarization, (II) protection of AlN in the mask fabrication steps such as thermal/mechanical/chemical-based cleanings and etchings, (III) presence as a homoepitaxial buffer layer for the subsequent GaN NW.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic of Ti-mask patterned Si substrate and SAG NWs (plot not to scale). In the nucleation stage, GaN epitaxially accumulates in nanoholes. Subsequently, full NWs grow with their bottoms shaped by nanoholes. A NW array forms with single NWs packed closely. (b) High angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image of the interface between GaN:Si segments and Si substrate with Ti mask. The thickness of the AlN/GaN:Ge buffer layer was measured to be 3 nm. 

Preparations of patterned substrate. 
After cleaning Si wafers by using acetone, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and deionized (DI) water, Si wafers were dipped in buffered oxide etchant (BOE) for 2 min. AlN/GaN:Ge layers were grown on Si wafers by using RF-PA MBE (Veeco, GEN II). The growth of the 3 nm AlN/GaN:Ge buffer layer was conducted with a substrate temperature (Tsub) of 810 °C. At the beginning of AlN growth, a short pulse of Al beam flux was introduced prior to the nitridation with a nitrogen flow rate of 0.45 sccm. After the 1 min growth of AlN, the GaN:Ge buffer layer was grown for 2 min with Ga and Ge beam fluxes and a nitrogen flow rate of 0.35 sccm. It is worthwhile mentioning that hereafter Tsub refers to thermocouple temperature. By using e-beam evaporation, a 10 nm-thick Ti layer was then deposited on the buffer layer as the mask material. A PMMA e-beam resist layer was then spin-coated onto the Ti layer, and nanohole-array patterns were defined into the PMMA layer by using e-beam lithography (MIRA3 XMH equipped with a Schottky field emission electron gun). To transfer the patterns from PMMA to the Ti layer, the exposed Ti material was etched using CHF3 reactive ion etching (RIE). After that, PMMA resist was removed by using a two-step process including O2 RIE and organic solvent cleaning with NMP based removers (Remover 1165). The patterned substrates underwent a clean using concentrated HCl (37%) before being loaded into the MBE chamber.


Epitaxy of AlInGaN NW arrays. 
The SAG process of GaN:Si/(Al)InGaN/GaN:Mg NWs was conducted in an RF-PA MBE chamber (Veeco, GenXplor). Prior to NW epitaxy, the nitridation of the Ti mask was carried out at 350 °C for 10 min. The n-GaN growth parameters included Tsub of 885 °C, the N2 flow rate of 0.35 sccm, nitrogen plasma power of 350 W, Ga beam equivalent pressure (BEP) of 2.35 × 10−7 Torr and Si Knudsen effusion cell temperature of 1175 °C. As shown in Table 1, (Al)InGaN growth parameters were varied for samples A, B, C and D, while N2 flow rate was kept the same as 1.5 sccm. Mg-Doped p-GaN segment included one bottom layer and one top layer grown with Mg BEP of 2.14 × 10−9 and 2.89 × 10−9 Torr, respectively. Other p-GaN growth parameters included Ga BEP of 2.35 × 10−7 Torr, Tsub of 870 °C and a N2 flow rate of 0.55 sccm.

2.2 Structural and optical characterization

STEM of NWs-on-Si interface. 
The sample was made by using the focused ion beam (FIB) lift-out method. HAADF-STEM images were taken using an FEI Titan TEM operated at 200 kV. The HAADF images were acquired with a convergence semi-angle of 19.1 mrad and the collection angle was between 50 to 200 mrad. One of the typical features for HAADF images is the Z contrast is that the heavier atom has brighter intensity. The microscope was fitted with a high-resolution energy-loss spectrometer (Gatan GIF model 966) with the state-of-the-art K2 Summit direct electron detector camera. The spectrum images were acquired with a GIF collection semi-angle of 20.7 mrad. The dwell time of each pixel (size: ∼2 Å) for EELS mapping was 2 ms to increase the mapping area and minimize the beam damages.


SEM and PL of NW arrays on Si. 
The bird's-eye-view SEM images of NWs on Si were taken with a 45-degree angle (FEI Inspect F-50 FE-SEM). PL measurements of NW arrays were performed under 405 nm laser excitation. A neutral density filter was used to vary incident photon flux density in the range of 4.10 × 1020–8.13 × 1023 m−2 s−1. An iHR550 spectrometer with a liquid N2 cooled CCD was used to resolve the emitted light. Low-temperature PL measurements were carried out at 78.0 K by using a liquid N2 closed-loop cryostat.

2.3 Device fabrication and photovoltaic characterization

NWs-on-Si device fabrication. 
After dipping NWs-on-Si samples in BOE, Ti (20 nm)/Au (100 nm) were deposited onto the backside of the n-Si substrate to serve as n-metal contacts. A polyimide resists layer was spin-coated onto samples to fully cover NW arrays for planarization, followed by O2 plasma RIE to expose GaN:Mg at the NW top. The exposed GaN:Mg segments are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Thereafter, a SiOx layer was deposited onto exposed GaN:Mg arrays, followed by standard photolithography and etching to create openings. After the samples were dipped in concentrated HCl (37%) for 1 min, thin Ni (6 nm)/Au (6 nm) was deposited by an e-beam evaporator to serve as a p-metal contact layer. Following that, a 100 nm indium tin oxide (ITO) was deposited by using RF sputtering deposition for efficient carrier transport. After p-contact (Ni/Au/ITO) layers lift-off, p-contact only forms in SiOx openings. The p-contact layers were further processed with two-step annealing including rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at ∼550 °C in ambient N2 gas for 1 min and annealing at 300 °C in vacuum for 1 hour. Ni (20 nm)/Au (100 nm) metal grid contact was then fabricated on the ITO layer.


PV characterization. 
The J–V characteristics of SAG NW devices were measured in the dark environment and under 100 mW cm−2 illumination from an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Newport, Oriel, LCS-100). The J–V characterizations under 30-sun illumination were performed by using a Xenon arc lamp (Excelitas Technologies, Cermax, R400-1) with an AM 1.5G filter. The NW devices were placed on a cooling plate (TE technology Inc., CP-031) integrated with a thermoelectric temperature controller. The electroluminescent characterizations and J–V characterizations were performed by using a source meter (Keithley, SMU 2400) for forward bias.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characteristics of conductive NWs-on-Si interface
Vertical-type devices with top and bottom electrodes enable large device density on a single chip. Thousands of vertical-type components, such as vertically-aligned p–i–n single SAG NWs,24 can be deposited and fabricated at the same time. The manufacturing process of such chips reduces the time and cost for production and test process. Such devices with conductive substrates facilitate efficient carrier collection/injection.24,56 The SAG NW-on-Si approach enables such a manufacturing process with scaling advantages over lateral devices.57 Another advantage of SAG NW-on-Si structure is a straightforward fabrication of metal contact at the backside of Si substrates. In contrast, devices on high-resistance substrates generally require a side electrode. The side-electrode fabrication includes selective-area etching active materials down to the bottom n-GaN or n-AlGaN layer and deposition of contact next to active regions.38,58
In order to make the resistance of the AlN/GaN:Ge buffer layer negligible, a very thin (a few nm) AlN/GaN:Ge buffer layer was used in this SAG work. As shown schematically in Fig. 1a, on the exposed AlN/GaN:Ge buffer layer, nanoholes are firstly filled to form n-GaN nucleation sites for the subsequent epitaxy of p–i–n NW heterostructures. As shown in Fig. 1b, the HAADF-STEM image justifies the schematic illustration of the NWs-on-Si interface. This STEM study was conducted on a sample with a 100 nm thickness along the electron beam direction. The thickness of the ultra-thin AlN/GaN:Ge buffer layer between Ti mask and Si substrate was measured to be 3 nm. A high-resolution HAADF-STEM image of the NW-on-Si interface is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).
As shown in Fig. 2, Al, Ga, N, Si and Ti elemental distributions at the NWs-on-Si interfacial region were characterized by using high-resolution EELS mapping. As shown in Fig. 2b and d, N and Ga distributions clearly present the profiles of NW bottom segments. The sharp and smooth interface of Si distribution (Fig. 2a) justifies the extremely high precision and sensitivity of EELS mapping. At the 3 nm thick NWs-on-Si interface, both Ga and Al distribution are discontinuous, in contrast to the continuous N distribution. At the interface, the discontinuities (dark or intensity close to zero) in Al elemental distribution indicate the existence of large number of pits and voids in the AlN layer, considering that the pixel size of EELS mapping (∼0.2 nm) is much smaller than the Al discontinuities (maximum size: ∼10 nm). The subsequent epitaxy of the GaN:Ge layer also shows discontinuities (maximum size: ∼16 nm), such as in positions 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (marked with white dashed lines in Fig. 2d and e), where Ga shows no visible intensity, while Al shows strong intensity. Importantly, the growth of GaN:Ge takes place in some pits and voids of the AlN layer, such as positions 3, 4 and 9 (marked with red dashed lines in Fig. 2d and e), where Ga shows a relatively strong intensity, while Al shows discontinuities. In addition, it is highly possible that Ga, Ge, and Al interdiffuse during high-temperature NW growth, resulting in the formation of AlGaN:Ge, GaN:Ge, Ti and AlGaN:Ge fill in structural vacancies of the AlN layer, facilitating carrier transport and carrier tunneling through the buffer layer. Similar approaches to filling the vias in the AlN layer with highly conductive n-AlGaN have been reported to facilitate carrier transport through AlN.57

(d) Ga and (e) Al distributions are compared at the position 1–9 marked with white and red dashed lines. 
The high electrical conductivity of such AlN layer was justified by the Jsc and η of Si solar cell (with a p+-Si/n-Si tunnel junction) deposited with AlN, shown in Fig. S3 and Table S1 (ESI†). The high electrical conductivity of the 3 nm AlN/GaN:Ge buffer layer and the advantages of the SAG n-GaN NW array on the Si substrate have been further demonstrated by photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen generation and the associated PEC characteristics. Under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination, the PEC characteristics of 880 nm-long SAG n-GaN NW array photoanode on the Si substrate exhibit a photocurrent density of 0.61 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). A photocurrent density of 0.3 mA cm−2 at 1.35 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) has been reported for SAG NW photoanode using 14 μm-long SAG GaN-InGaN core–shell microwire arrays grown on GaN/sapphire substrate.59
3.2 SAG process of NWs-on-Si
The presence of a weak but noticeable N K intensity in the Ti mask layer (Fig. 2b) indicates the formation of TiNx in the 3 min nitridation process prior to NW epitaxy and during NW epitaxy. However, the resulting Ti mask layer is a Ti-majority Ti/TiNx alloy because N K distribution is weak and relatively limited in the Ti mask region. This observation reveals the nature of the SAG alloy mask layer, which is critical for atom sticking and NW selectivity. In addition, there is almost no Ga signal (Fig. 2d) on the mask layer, indicating good selectivity during the NWs-on-Si SAG process.
The n-GaN nucleation site, which is confined and shaped by nanohole of Ti mask, can be clearly observed at NW bottoms, shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. 2. That bottom-most region exhibits a smaller diameter due to the restriction of nanohole. Once n-GaN grows beyond Ti mask, NW diameter increases with a lateral growth rate.
On the patterned Si substrate, n-GaN/(Al)InGaN/p-GaN NW arrays were grown with controllable NW diameter and positions. Such p–i–n (Al)InGaN NW consists of ∼0.49 μm GaN:Si bottom segment, ∼0.29 μm (Al)InGaN active segment and ∼0.15 μm GaN:Mg top segment. Taking advantage of the SAG flexibility of controlling nanohole diameter and periodicity, the NW array-packing fraction can be increased to be nearly unity to improve light absorption. With careful tuning of MBE parameters and growth duration of the n-GaN segment, a high packing fraction was obtained for the AlInGaN NW array without coalescing between neighboring NWs, as shown in Fig. 3a. The SAG NW array exhibits Ga-polarity based on the observation of semipolar top facets and hexagonal pyramid morphology at the top. As a result of Ga-polarity crystal structure, the nano-pyramid features at the top of SAG NWs can further improve light harvesting.60 For those NW arrays, the nanohole-array pattern on Ti maskhad a hexagonal opening with a 102 nm side length (a diameter of 204 nm) and the array was arranged in a triangular lattice with a 320 nm periodicity.
 Fig. 3  (a) Close-packed AlInGaN NW Arrays with a FESEM view angle of 45°. The top-view SEM image is shown in the inset. NW array was arranged in a triangular lattice with a 320 nm lattice constant. (b) PL spectra of (Al) InGaN NWs A, B, C and D, showing a blueshift in the emission peak with increasing Al BEP and increasing Tsub. 
To obtain uniform and closed-packed AlInGaN NW arrays with high crystal quality, it is essential to grow uniform GaN:Si NW segments with perfect SAG selectivity. This requires optimized MBE parameters (III/V ratio, Tsub and Ga flux) and well-controlled pattern parameters (nanohole size and periodicity). In the case that undesired GaN:Si grows on the Ti mask, the subsequent AlInGaN and GaN:Mg continue growing on those undesired GaN. Those undesired crystals may grow and combine with neighboring SAG NWs, leading to coalescence and shadowing effect.
To study the effects of Al incorporation into the SAG InGaN active region on the performance of NWs-on-Si SCs, MBE parameters of (Al)InGaN segments were varied, as shown in Table 1, for NWs A, B, C and D. Their MBE parameters of GaN:Si and GaN:Mg segments were kept the same among these growths. The desorption of In atoms is much stronger compared than that of Al and Ga atoms.61 To enhance In incorporation in (Al)InGaN segments, Tsubstrate was reduced to 700–715 °C and the N2 flow rate was increased to 1.5 sccm. The adopted III/V ratio for the (Al)InGaN segment was much lower than that for n-GaN and p-GaN segments.
3.3 Characteristics of SAG AlInGaN core–shell structure
PL emissions of NWs A, B, C and D are shown in Fig. 3b. Summarized in Table 1, their peak emission wavelength (λPL) varies in the range of 513.8–527.9 nm, corresponding to the photon energy of 2.349–2.413 eV. With increasing Al BEP and increasing Tsubstrate, Al content of (Al)InGaN segment increases, leading to the blueshift of peak wavelength. PL full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) varies in the range of 32.4–42.9 nm, corresponding to 146–200 meV. Such FWHM is smaller than that reported for self-organized green InGaN NW array and InGaN quantum wells (QWs) epilayers.18,19,58 The reported relatively broader emissions (∼58–87 nm (ref. 50 and 62)) of self-organized InGaN NW array are resulting from inhomogeneous In distribution in each NW, and compositional variations due to fluctuations in NW diameter and position, which is also a challenge to improve the packing fraction. Grown on GaN/sapphire, SAG green InGaN/GaN QW NW arrays with a thin InGaN segment (∼50 nm) exhibits narrow spectral linewidths, such as linewidths of ∼27 nm (135 meV)26 with λPL of 506 nm and linewidths of 31.5–37.5 nm (ref. 25) with λPL of 529.1–543.3 nm. In the current study of the SAG AlInGaN NW array on the Si substrate, Al incorporation and thick active segment (∼5 times thicker) do not increase the linewidth significantly, compared to those linewidths of 31.5–37.5 nm (ref. 25) with λPL of 529.1–543.3 nm.
A two-dimensional In-deficient shell (AlGaN shell) was formed surrounding the In-rich core in the AlInGaN segment of SAG NWs, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The underlying formation mechanism is caused by both low In incorporation63 at the lateral surfaces (m-plane) and strong In desorption. Under relatively high Tsubstrate, In atoms experience much stronger thermal desorption compared to Ga and Al atoms.61 At NW growth front (polar c-plane), direct impingent and diffusive In adatoms can immediately compensate the desorbed In atom. However, the In supply to the lateral surfaces is limited due to the shadowing effect of neighboring NWs.61,64 The spontaneous formation of an AlGaN shell surrounding In-rich core is also attributed to smaller Al atom diffusion length compared to that of Ga and In atoms.44 Importantly, such a large-bandgap AlGaN shell provides radial surface passivation for In-rich core to suppress non-radiative surface recombination.53
To further reveal the effect of Al incorporation on thick InGaN segment and the effect of incident photon flux density (ϕ) on absorption edge of (Al)InGaN segments, power-dependent PL measurements were conducted on NW A (InGaN) at room temperature (RT) and NWs C (AlInGaN) at both RT and 78.0 K. Variations of λPL, PL FWHM, and integrated PL peak intensity versus ϕ are summarized in Fig. 4a–c, respectively. In Fig. 4a and b, the λPL blueshift and the narrowing of PL FWHM with increasing ϕ are observed at both RT and 78.0 K, when ϕ is less than ∼5 × 1022 m−2s−1. These results mainly from state filling of the localized state formed by potential fluctuation and the screening of QCSE. The presence of QCSE leads to a redshift of bandgap energy compared to that of III-nitride without QCSE, however, photoexcited carriers screen the QCSE. The redshift caused by QCSE is reduced with increasing photoexcited carriers, equivalent to a blueshift with increasing ϕ.
 Fig. 4  Variations of (a) PL peak wavelength, (b) FWHM of PL peak, and (c) integrated PL peak intensity versus 405 nm laser photon flux density, summarized from PL spectra of NW A (InGaN) measured at room temperature (RT) and NW C (AlInGaN) measured at both room temperature and 78.0 K. (a) and (b) are plotted with photon flux density in log-10 scale and (c) is plotted with photon flux density in linear scale. ϕ1-Sun in (a) is photon flux density of 1-Sun solar spectral portion with photon energy >2.35 eV and ϕ30-Sun corresponds to that of 30-Sun illumination. 
As shown in Fig. 4a and b, in the low-ϕ range, λPL of AlInGaN NWs measured at 78.0 K shows a larger blueshift and a more significant narrowing than that measured at RT. This indicates a considerable thermal broadening effect and thermal redshift effect of NWs at RT. In the high-ϕ range shown in Fig. 4a, relatively smaller peak blue shifts are mainly attributed to the state-filling effect, considering that QCSE is screened in the high-ϕ range. In the high-ϕ range, the linewidth broadening of AlInGaN NWs (RT) is moderate compared to that of InGaN NWs (RT). This indicates less thermal broadening effects on the AlInGaN NW array with the benefits of suppressed non-radiative surface recombinations.
The AlInGaN segments can only absorb photon flux with photon energy higher than its energy bandgap. Namely, AlInGaN segments can only absorb ultraviolet portion and some of the visible portion of the solar spectrum, the international standard of which is ASTM G-173 solar spectra.65 In Fig. 4a, ϕ1-Sun (blue dotted line) is photon flux density of 1-Sun solar spectral portion with photon energy >2.35 eV, and ϕ30-Sun (blue dotted line) corresponding to that of 30-Sun illumination. The variation of AlInGaN energy bandgap of NW C versus the photon flux density of solar illumination can be revealed approximately by investigating its λPL blueshift under 405 nm laser excitation of ϕ1-Sun and ϕ30-Sun. Compared to the peak wavelength of ϕ1-Sun, the peak wavelength of ϕ30-Sun exhibits a blueshift. Such a blueshift corresponds to a blueshift of λPL from 526.9 nm to 523.9 nm and a blueshift of λPL + FWHM/2 from 545.9 nm to 540.4 nm. This indicates an absorption-edge blueshift for NWs C SC when the illumination is changed from 1-Sun illumination to 30-Sun illumination.
As shown in Fig. 4c, the integrated PL intensity (2FWHM range) of the AlInGaN NW array is nearly 2.5 times as high as that of InGaN NW arrays. This is attributed to the formation of the AlInGaN core–shell structure. For NWs, excited by continuous-wave incident photons, the equilibrium between optical charge carrier generation rate G and recombination rates is described as G = Rr + Rnr = Rr + Rnr–bulk + Rnr–surface(1)where Rr is radiative recombination rate, Rnr is non-radiative recombination rate, Rnr–bulk is non-radiative recombination rate of Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination in the bulk region, and Rnr–surface is non-radiative recombination rate mediated by surface states. Rnr–bulk66 and Rnr–surface67,68 can be described as functions of electron concentration n and hole concentration p: Rnr–bulk = np/(nτp + pτn)(2) Rnr–surface = npσ(νnνp)0.5(3)where τp and τn are non-radiative SRH lifetimes of electrons and holes, σ is the capture cross-section of surface non-radiative recombination, and νn and νp are mean thermal velocity of electrons and holes, respectively. τp and τn are inversely proportional to the trap densities in the bulk region. σ is a constant proportional to the surface state density. PL intensity IPL can be described by using n = p in eqn (2) and (3): IPL = ηdetRr = ηdet[G − n/(τp + τn) − n2σ(νnνp)0.5](4)where ηdet is the detection efficiency. G is proportional to ϕ, and n increases with G. The third term n2σ(νnνp)0.5 can be reduced by proper surface passivations. As shown in Fig. 4c, AlInGaN segments exhibit higher PL intensity with a core–shell structure, which provides surface passivation and thus a smaller σ than that of InGaN NWs. For InGaN NWs, its nonlinear portion of IPLversus ϕ (ϕ:2.8 × 1023–8.1 × 1023 m−2 s−1) is speculated to be caused by strong non-radiative surface recombination, since the surface recombination term n2σ(νnνp)0.5 increases nonlinearly with n.
3.4 Photovoltaic characteristics of SAG NW arrays on Si
As shown in the schematic of the SAG NWs-on-Si device (Fig. 5a) and the SEM image of the NW device with p-contact (Fig. 5b) of Ni/Au/ITO, p–i–n AlInGaN NW arrays can be fabricated to form top-illuminated SCs integrating n-Si as the bottom contact. SAG process of (Al)InGaN NWs provides an approach for PVs via precise control of NW size and morphology to obtain a high degree of size uniformity and a high packing fraction for relatively thick AlInGaN absorption segments.
 Fig. 5  (a) Schematic illustration of SAG GaN:Si/AlInGaN/GaN:Mg NW solar cells on Si substrates. The top p-contact consisting of thin Ni/Au and ITO exhibits high transmissivity in the solar spectral range. The Ti/Au layer and Ni/Au grid contact were respectively deposited at the backside of the n-type Si substrate and on the top p-contact to supply electricity to an external circuit. (b) A bird's-eye-view SEM image of SAG AlInGaN NW array at the top of which p-contact (Ni/Au/ITO layers) were deposited in the opening of SiOx dielectric mask. The inset of (b) is the magnified SEM image near the boundary between the SiOx mask and the p-contact area. (c) J–V output characteristics of SAG NW solar cells by using NWs A, B, C and D. The Al composition of NW samples is A < B < C < D, and Voc increases from NWs A to NWs D. The electroluminescent (EL) image of green-emitting SAG AlInGaN NW device under forward-bias condition is shown in the inset of (c). 
As shown in Fig. 5c, the J–V output characteristics of NW A (InGaN) exhibits a relatively low Voc of 0.34 V, and its J increases remarkably in the reverse biasing region, indicating a considerable leakage current. Its PV performance is limited by carrier leakage and significant nonradiative carrier recombination associated with NW surface states. Voc, FF and η increase remarkably with the increase in Al incorporation of active segments, attributed to the afore-described core–shell structure. Such AlInGaN NW SCs exhibit much higher Voc, FF and η than the commonly reported values of InGaN NW SCs,46,49 without compromising Jsc.46,49,52
Based on Boltzmann statistics and Born-Oppenheimer theory, Voc for SRH recombination can be described as:66 eVoc,SRH = Eg − 2kTln{N0.5CN0.5V/[G(τp + τn)]}(5)where Eg, k, T, NC, NV are bandgap, Boltzmann constant, absolute temperature, effective density of states in the conduction band, and that in the valence band, respectively. By using a similar mathematics approach presented in the literature,66 the dependence of Voc on non-radiative recombination mediated by surface states can be obtained by using eqn (3): eVoc,nr–surface = Eg – kTln(NCNV/np) = Eg − kTln(NCNVσν0.5nν0.5p/G)(6)
It can be concluded from eqn (6) that a smaller capture cross-section σ leads to a higher Voc. This explains the observation of higher Voc in AlInGaN core–shell structures which provide surface passivations to NW SCs. Higher Voc in NW SCs with surface passivations can also be explained by using eqn (5). With surface states being understood as SRH traps,67 non-radiative lifetimes τp and τn increase significantly with passivated surfaces and thus higher Voc.
The effect of Al incorporation on PV characteristics of NW SCs (Voc from 0.34 to 1.10 V, FF from 0.385 to 0.659, η from 0.585% to 2.27%) is significant, making the bandgap variation of 2.349–2.413 eV negligible. The improvements in Voc, FF and η were obtained by optimizing the Al incorporation. However, with increasing Al incorporation, Jsc reduces from 4.415 mA cm−2 of NW A (InGaN) to 3.123 mA cm−2 of NW D (AlInGaN). AlInGaN NW SCs exhibit higher Voc and higher η than those reported for InGaN NW solar cells in literature. The PV output characteristics and η of NWs C and D SCs are comparable to those reported for some InGaN planar SCs grown on GaN/sapphire,54 however, they are still lower than those reported for InGaN planar SCs grown on the SiCN/Si(1 1 1) substrate.23 As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), further increased Al incorporation leads to reductions in Jsc and η, due to increased bandgap of the active segment and possible higher strain.
To analyze PV current–voltage (I–V) characteristics, the following equation has been frequently used:69 I = I0{exp[q(V − IRs)/(nkT)] −1}–IL(7)where I0, q, Rs, n and IL are saturation current, electronic charge, series resistance, ideality factor and light-generated current. The following equation can be obtained by differentiating both sides of eqn (7): Rs + nkT/[q(I + IL + I0)] = dV/dI ≈ ΔV/ΔI(8)where ΔV and ΔI are the step-size increase of V and I in the measured I–V characteristics. Rs of SAG n-gaN/AlInGaN/p-GaN NW arrays on n-Si can be evaluated by using Eqn (8). As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), Rs of NWs C and NWs D on n-Si is ∼1.0 Ω, which is comparable to that of SAG p–i–n NW-array device on GaN/sapphire and the reported Rs of Si SCs is in the range of 0.38–3.5 Ω.69 This indicates that 3 nm AlN/GaN:Ge is negligible in resistance.

Eqn (7) is rewritten as the following J–V relationship to analyze J–V characteristics of NWs C: J = J0{exp[q(V − JARs)/(nkT)] −1}–JL(9)where J0, A and JL are saturation current density, device area and light generated current density, respectively. By organizing eqn (9) and replacing its ARs by using eqn (8), which is ARs ≈ ΔV/ΔJ–nkT/[q(J + JL + J0)], V–J relationship can be obtained as V = (nkT/q)ln[(J + JL)/J0 + 1] + J{ΔV/ΔJ − nkT/[q(J + JL + J0)]}(10)where ΔJ is the step-size increase of J in the measured J–V characteristics.
As a function of J, ΔV/ΔJ can be calculated from the measured J–V characteristics of NWs SCs.
The V–J characteristics of NW C (AlInGaN) in a dark environment, under 1-Sun illumination, and under 30-Sun illumination are shown in Fig. 6. JL can be obtained from the least-square fittings of V–J characteristics by using eqn (10). The high-intensity illumination generally increases the output power logarithmically and photocurrent proportionally.70 However, the derived JL, does not increase proportionally with light intensity. As shown in Fig. 6, JL (100.088 mA cm−2) of 30-sun illumination is less than 105.270 mA cm−2, which is 30 times JL (3.509 mA cm−2) of 1-sun illumination. JL = 100.088 mA cm−2 corresponds to a 4.92% reduction compared to 105.270 mA cm−2. Such a reduction in JL is mainly associated with the blueshift of absorption edge when the incident photon flux density increases from ϕ1-Sun to ϕ30-Sun. The blueshift of the absorption edge can be revealed approximately based on the blueshift in PL measurement. The blueshift of the absorption edge, corresponding to the blueshift of λPL + FWHM/2 from 545.9 nm to 540.4 nm, leads to a 4.28% reduction in the absorption of solar radiation.65
 Fig. 6  
V–J output characteristics of NW C (AlInGaN) SC measured and fitted for a dark environment, 1-Sun illumination and 30-Sun illumination. The NW SC was placed on a cold plate at 25 °C. The measured V–J curves are shown as symbols which merges as bold lines. The measured curves are fitted using eqn (10) and JL = 0, 3.5 and 100.1 mA cm−2 are derived, respectively. 
The J–V characteristics of NW D (AlInGaN) in a dark environment, under 1-Sun illumination and under 30-Sun illumination are shown in Fig. 7. In the dark environment, the AlInGaN NW SC exhibited good diode characteristics, with a rectifying ratio of ∼313 measured at −1.0 and 1.0 V. Under 30-Sun illumination, Jsc, Voc, FF and η of NW D SC were measured to be 83.43 mA cm−2, 1.41 V, 0.628 and 2.46%. Notably, 30-sun illumination leads to a high Jsc of 83.43 mA cm−2, promising for high-power photovoltaics on Si. The heat generated by the Xenon arc lamp, non-radiative recombination processes and contact resistance increase the temperature of NW SCs. As summarized in Fig. 7b, Voc and Jsc depend on temperature. With increasing temperature from 1.4 °C to 27.0 °C, Voc decreases from 1.41 V to 1.31 V and Jsc increases from 83.43 mA cm−2 to 89.43 mA cm−2. As shown in Fig. 7c, without cooling, AlInGaN NW SC exhibits stable and repeatable Voc under 30-Sun illumination. This observation shows the robustness and stability of AlInGaN NW devices integrating the Si substrate as the bottom contact with the electrical and thermal advantages.

4. Conclusions
Uniform and close-packed p–i–n GaN-based nanowire arrays were selective-area grown on a patterned Si substrates with a negligible-resistance AlN/GaN:Ge buffer layer, enabling SAG GaN-based NWs-on-Si devices with a relatively low series resistance of ∼1 Ω. The results on selective area epitaxy and NW devices demonstrate that such a 3 nm-thick AlN/GaN:Ge buffer layer maintains the effectiveness and flexibility of the SAG technique to grow a uniform NW array with controlled dimensions and position on the Si substrate. High-precision HAADF-STEM and EELS-STEM characterizations of NWs-on-Si interface support the SAG NW architecture. Ga, Al and Ti elemental distributions explain the negligible resistance of the AlN/GaN:Ge buffer layer. During the selective area epitaxy of AlInGaN segments, In-rich core is surrounded by a spontaneously formed AlGaN shell, which can effectively suppress the nonradiative surface recombination and improve NW optical and photovoltaic characteristics. Such a core–shell structure, obtained by using proper Al corporation during the MBE process, improves Voc from 0.34 to 1.10 V, FF from 0.385 to 0.659 and η from 0.585% to 2.27% under 1-Sun illumination. The light-generated current density of AlInGaN NWs SC does not increase proportionally with illumination intensity and it is mainly associated with the blueshift of the absorption edge with increasing photon flux density. The use of a relatively thick absorption segment (∼0.29 μm), AlInGaN core–shell structure, and Si substrate significantly increase the device stability and performance for high-power photovoltaics without cooling, by absorbing high-intensity illumination, minimizing nonradiative recombination, and enhancing the heat dissipation. The SAG NWs-on-Si structure paves the way to monolithically integrate SAG III-nitride/Si integrated electronics by using MBE, such as InGaN/Si tandem solar cells and CMOS-compatible III-nitride on-chip electronics.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic of Ti-mask patterned Si substrate and SAG NWs (plot not to scale). In the nucleation stage, GaN epitaxially accumulates in nanoholes. Subsequently, full NWs grow with their bottoms shaped by nanoholes. A NW array forms with single NWs packed closely. (b) High angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image of the interface between GaN:Si segments and Si substrate with Ti mask. The thickness of the AlN/GaN:Ge buffer layer was measured to be 3 nm.

B	1.46	7.65	1.78	700	526.2
C	3.36	8.46	1.78	710	522.3
D	4.26	9.52	1.78	715	513.8

 	Fig. 2  Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) mapping results of the interface between SAG NW and Si substrate. (a–e) Si, N, Ti, Ga and Al EELS mapping results acquired at the same position. (d) Ga and (e) Al distributions are compared at the position 1–9 marked with white and red dashed lines.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Close-packed AlInGaN NW Arrays with a FESEM view angle of 45°. The top-view SEM image is shown in the inset. NW array was arranged in a triangular lattice with a 320 nm lattice constant. (b) PL spectra of (Al) InGaN NWs A, B, C and D, showing a blueshift in the emission peak with increasing Al BEP and increasing Tsub.	 

 	Fig. 4  Variations of (a) PL peak wavelength, (b) FWHM of PL peak, and (c) integrated PL peak intensity versus 405 nm laser photon flux density, summarized from PL spectra of NW A (InGaN) measured at room temperature (RT) and NW C (AlInGaN) measured at both room temperature and 78.0 K. (a) and (b) are plotted with photon flux density in log-10 scale and (c) is plotted with photon flux density in linear scale. ϕ1-Sun in (a) is photon flux density of 1-Sun solar spectral portion with photon energy >2.35 eV and ϕ30-Sun corresponds to that of 30-Sun illumination.

 	Fig. 5  (a) Schematic illustration of SAG GaN:Si/AlInGaN/GaN:Mg NW solar cells on Si substrates. The top p-contact consisting of thin Ni/Au and ITO exhibits high transmissivity in the solar spectral range. The Ti/Au layer and Ni/Au grid contact were respectively deposited at the backside of the n-type Si substrate and on the top p-contact to supply electricity to an external circuit. (b) A bird's-eye-view SEM image of SAG AlInGaN NW array at the top of which p-contact (Ni/Au/ITO layers) were deposited in the opening of SiOx dielectric mask. The inset of (b) is the magnified SEM image near the boundary between the SiOx mask and the p-contact area. (c) J–V output characteristics of SAG NW solar cells by using NWs A, B, C and D. The Al composition of NW samples is A < B < C < D, and Voc increases from NWs A to NWs D. The electroluminescent (EL) image of green-emitting SAG AlInGaN NW device under forward-bias condition is shown in the inset of (c).
