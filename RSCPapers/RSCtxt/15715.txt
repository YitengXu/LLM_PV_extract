    Abstract[6,6]-Thienyl-C61-butyric acid ester derivatives with methyl, hexyl and 2-ethylhexyl at the 5-position of thiophene ring (TCBM-Cn, n represents the number of carbon atom in the alkyl chain) were synthesized. Unlike [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), these methanofullerene derivatives ([6,6] adduct) can be directly obtained from the typical diazo addition under mild conditions, and high temperature isomerization is unnecessary. With a hexyl or 2-ethylhexyl group at the 5-position of thiophene, the solubility of TCBM-Cn in chlorobenzene is as high as 180 ± 10 mg ml−1. Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic solar cells were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):TCBM-Cn (1:0.8 w/w)/LiF/Al. The device based-on TCBM-C6 exhibited the best performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 4.26%.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted more and more attention as a renewable energy sources due to their easy and cheap processing.1–5 For this type of device, a blend of electron-donating materials (p-type conjugated polymers) and an electron-accepting material (n-type materials) is used as the active layer, and a derivative of buckminsterfullerene (C60), i.e. [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), is the most often used electron-accepting material.6 To further improve the device performance, different C60 derivatives7–20,24 have been synthesized. Particularly, many efforts have been devoted to modify the PCBM skeleton by introducing substituents on the phenyl ring,12,15,16 exchanging methyl groups with long alkyl17 chains, an ethyleneoxy moiety18 or a perfloroalkyl chain19 to tune the miscibility, thermal properties and energy levels, and the resulting C60 derivatives have been successfully used to control the film morphology, raise the open circuit voltage (Voc), and improve the device stability.
Although PCBM is the most popular acceptor materials so far for BHJ PSCs, it is questionable whether it is the best for polymer donor materials with the huge diversity of chemical structures. Therefore, it is still very important to explore new C60 derivatives, particularly those with ease of synthesis and purification. It is well known that thiophene is an aromatic ring characterized by easy modification. Recently, a PCBM analogue, i.e. [6,6]-thienyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (TCBM), has been reported to exhibit device performance close to PCBM with regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the donor.20,24 To further explore the easily made high performance C60-based acceptors for BHJ PSCs, herein we synthesized a series of TCBM analogues with different alkyl chains (methyl, hexyl and ethylhexyl) on the thiophene ring, as shown in Fig. 1. BHJ PSCs based on the blend of P3HT and these new C60 derivatives exhibited power conversion efficiencies (PCE) identical to or slightly higher than those prepared from P3HT and PCBM or TCBM. Most importantly, these C60 derivatives can be made directly by the typical diazo addition without high temperature isomerization.

Measurements

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV 300 spectrometer at 300 MHz and a Bruker AV 600 spectrometer at 600 MHz. Elemental analysis was performed on a varioEL elemental analysis system. UV-Vis-NIR spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a CHI660a electrochemical analyzer with a three-electrode cell in a solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in CH2Cl2 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. A platinum disc electrode with a diameter of 10 mm, a Pt wire, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the working electrode, the counter electrode, and the reference electrode, respectively. The potential was calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were estimated by the equations: LUMO = −(4.80 + Eonsetred) eV.26 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEOL JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV.
Photovoltaic device fabrication and characterization
The PSCs were fabricated with the device structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/P3HT:TCBM-Cn (1:0.8 w/w)/LiF/Al. The ITO glass was precleaned and modified by a 40 nm PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P4083) layer which was spin-coated from a PEDOT-PSS aqueous solution on the ITO substrate, and was dried subsequently at 120 °C for 30 min. The active layer of the blend of P3HT and TCBM-Cn was prepared by spin-coating the chlorobenzene solution of the P3HT and TCBM-Cn (1:0.8, w/w) with the P3HT concentration of 10 mg ml−1 on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode. The thickness of the active layer was controlled to ca. 115–125 nm by adjusting the rotating speed of the spin-coater. Then the LiF/Al cathode was deposited at a vacuum level of 4 × 10−4 Pa. The thicknesses of the LiF and Al layers are 1 and 200 nm, respectively. The devices were annealed at 160 °C for 10 min in the glove-box. Eight devices were fabricated per material to ensure the reproducibility of results. The effective area of the unit cell is 12 mm2. The current–voltage (I–V) measurement of the devices was conducted on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. A xenon lamp (500 W) was used as the white light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a Model SR830 DSP Lock-in Amplifier coupled with a SBP500 monochromator, a DSC102 date acquisition system and a Model SR540 chopper controller. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photodiode.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
As shown in Scheme 1, TCBM derivatives, i.e.TCBM-C1, TCBM-C6 and TCBM-C2,6 with methyl, hexyl and 2-ethylhexyl groups at the 5-position of the thiophene ring, were synthesized following the procedure for preparation of PCBM and TCBM,6a,20 but without high temperature isomerization. TCBM was also synthesized for comparison. First, 2a–d were prepared from 1a–d by Friedel–Crafts acylation25 in yields of 52 to 86%. Compounds 3a–d were prepared from 2a–d by esterification. They were reacted with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in methanol under reflux to afford compounds 4a–d. For preparation of the final compounds, C60 was dissolved in dried ODCB by ultrasonic method, and the resulting solution was added to the solution of 4 and sodium methoxide in pyridine. Unlike the preparation of PCBM, the successive reaction at 75 °C for 24 h directly afforded [6,6] isomers instead of the mixture of [5,6] and [6,6] adducts without further isomerization at high temperature, such as 180 °C typically for PCBM-type compounds as reported in the literature.6a,12,16–18 The resulting TCBM-Cn were purified by column chromatography on silica gel with toluene as eluent to give TCBM, TCBM-C1, TCBM-C6 and TCBM-C2,6 in yields of 40, 40, 46 and 49%, respectively. The enhanced yields for TCBM-C6 and TCBM-C2,6 are attributed to their high solubility, which makes the compounds easily recovered from chromatography. Actually, the solubility of TCBM and TCBM-C1 in chlorobenzene is 50 ± 5 mg ml−1, lower than 80 ± 5 mg ml−1 of PCBM. However, the solubility of TCBM-C6 and TCBM-C2,6 is as high as 180 ± 10 mg ml−1. This high solubility of TCBM-C6 and TCBM-C2,6 is promising for the device fabrication.

The structures of TCBM-Cn were validated by NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Both 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra indicate their [6,6] structural features. Fig. 2 shows the 1H NMR spectra of TCBM-C1 and 13C NMR spectra of TCBM-C2,6 as an example. As reported in the literature,6a,23 the 1H NMR signals of ArC(CH2)3COOMe are different for [5,6] and [6,6] isomers in terms of chemical shift. The presence of three sets of signals at ∼2.9, 2.6 and 2.2 ppm assigned to the aforementioned methylene groups in 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 2a) together with the 13C signals at ∼80 ppm attributed to the bridgehead carbons in 13C NMR spectrum (Fig. 2b) clearly indicate the formation of the neat methanofullerene structure, that is the [6,6] isomer.

Electrochemical properties
Electrochemical properties of TCBM-Cn were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 with CH2Cl2 and Bu4NPF6 as the solvent and supporting electrolyte, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1, all C60 derivatives including TCBM and PCBM have a similar CV scans with three quasi-reversible redox waves in the potential ranging from 0 to −2.0 V. The first half-wave potentials for all C60 derivatives (Ered1½) are around −1.07 V vs. Fc/Fc+, corresponding to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of −3.77 eV (Table 1). This indicates that the introduction of an alkyl chain onto the thiophene ring does not affect the LUMO level of TCBM derivatives.

Photovoltaic properties
BHJ PSCs with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:TCBM-Cn (1:0.8, w/w)/LiF/Al were fabricated for evaluation of the properties of the new acceptors. Control devices based-on P3HT/PCBM or TCBM were also prepared under identical conditions for comparison. As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 4, the performance of the control devices are well comparable to the reference report with average PCEs of 3.90 and 4.00% for PCBM and TCBM, respectively.24,27 The devices of TCBM-C1 show an average PCE of 3.95%. The devices of TCBM-C2,6 exhibit a slightly lower fill factor (FF) of 0.57, leading to the lowest PCE of 3.84%. TCBM-C6 shows the best device performance with a Voc of 0.63 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 10.61 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.64, leading to a PCE of 4.26%. This is different from the results reported by Troshin et al.,24 who reported that the device efficiencies were related to the solubilities of C60 derivatives, and the better device performance was achieved with solubilities of C60 derivatives in the range of 30 to 80 mg ml−1.

The films of P3HT/TCBM-Cn with a thickness of ∼30 nm were prepared under conditions identical to the device fabrication for TEM observation. TEM images of P3HT/PCBM, P3HT/TCBM-C6 and P3HT/TCBM-C2,6 films are shown in Fig. 5. All films are uniform with absence of large aggregates, which is consistent with the good device performance of these materials.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that [6,6]-thienyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (TCBM) and its alkyl-substituted derivatives (TCBM-Cn) can be synthesized directly from the typical diazo addition, and that the additional isomerization at high temperature is unnecessary. The yields of the TCBM-C6 and TCBM-C2,6 are as high as 46% and 49%, respectively. Meanwhile, these two C60 derivatives are highly soluble with a solubility of up to 180 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene. PSCs of TCBM-C6 exhibit the best device performance with a PCE of 4.26% (Jsc = 10.61 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.63 V, FF = 0.64). Easy synthesis, high solubility and excellent device performance qualify thienyl substituted C60 derivatives as promising alternatives to PCBM, the well known electron-accepting materials for BHJ PSCs.
