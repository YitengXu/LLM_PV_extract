Hundreds of polymeric matrices have been proposed over the years, and their functionalization with several groups, the variation of their molecular weight and the tuning of the crosslinking degree have been investigated. However, the true effect that polymeric matrices have on the cell parameters has often been addressed superficially, and hundreds of papers justify the obtained results with a simple bibliographic reference to other systems (sometimes completely different). This work proposes a system of nanoscale growth and crosslinking of a polymer electrolyte inside a nanostructured photoanode. Electrochemical and photovoltaic parameters are carefully monitored as a function of thickness and degree of penetration of the electrolyte. The results derived from this study refute many clichés generally accepted and taken for granted in many literature articles, and – for the first time – a compromise between the amount of polymer, cell efficiency and stability is achieved.
1. Introduction
Mimicking chlorophyllian photosynthesis was the strategy that allowed O'Regan and Grätzel to invent the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC)1,2 by making use of exceptionally cheaper and more readily available materials than those employed in other photovoltaic devices. After more than twenty years, DSSCs have now established themselves as the ideal device when low cost and good performance are required,3 and their implementation on an industrial scale has successfully started.4
DSSCs have given enormous contributions to the world of chemistry and materials science.5–8 In fact, being composed of very different materials, DSSCs constantly require more and more efficient (metal–)organic dyes,9,10 oxidic semiconductors,11 metallic12 and polymeric counter electrodes,13 liquid14 and quasi-solid15 electrolytes, hole-transporting16 and sealing17 materials. Efficiencies up to 13% have been obtained,18 and scientific research in this field is still very active, pushing towards new frontiers. Among these, the use of graphene as a counter electrode,19 the flexibilization of devices,20 the production of wire-shaped cells for textile applications,21 the increase in performance and stability through multifunctional coatings,22 the integration with water splitting devices,23 and the use of electrolytes with an aqueous matrix24,25 will be challenging and represent the promised lands of success for the next decade.
One of the most active research areas in recent years is that of quasi-solid electrolytes, because they have been demonstrated to be able to make DSSCs very stable over time, without significantly sacrificing their efficiency with respect to their liquid counterparts.26,27 Quasi-solid electrolytes are usually obtained by gelling a liquid solution containing the redox mediator and several additives. The gelation is achieved by using functionalized inorganic nanoparticles,28 gelling agents29 or polymeric matrices.30 Among these, polymers are the best choice due to their low cost, wide availability, absence of phase separation phenomena over time and high sunlight-to-electricity conversion efficiency.31,32
When comparing the performance of devices containing gel-polymer electrolytes to those of their liquid counterparts, a photocurrent decrease and photovoltage increase are usually obtained.31–33 This behavior is commonly justified by saying that the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of a quasi-solid DSSC is lowered by the polymer matrix which slows the diffusion of the redox mediator ions between the electrodes.34 On the other hand, the higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) of quasi-solid DSSCs is motivated by the decreased recombination phenomena at the photoanode/electrolyte interface when a protective polymeric shell is introduced, thus creating a barrier between the injected electrons and the I3− ions.35 However, the latter explanation contrasts with a common drawback that occurs in quasi-solid DSSCs, i.e. the poor polymer electrolyte penetration into the dye-sensitized photoanode mesopores which results in poor contact between the oxidized dye molecules and the redox mediator ions, thus lowering the regeneration efficiency and the overall cell performance.36 This drawback is a consequence of the fact that the average size of the photoanode mesopores is around 15–20 nm, whereas commonly used polymeric matrices have a coil shape in solution with a much bigger diameter (e.g., the coil diameter of poly(ethylene oxide) is 100–120 nm when its molecular weight is one million).37 For these reasons, the justification for an increased Voc on the basis of the polymer barrier created around the dye molecules should not be considered to be an indisputable concept, but should be studied in more detail and with a meticulous scientific approach.
In this study, the effect of a polymer matrix on the photocurrent and photovoltage of a quasi-solid DSSC is presented by a combined approach of polymer nano-growth in the photoanode mesopores and in situ photoelectrochemical measurements on the resulting cells. By choosing monomers with a low molecular weight and a combined in situ electrodeposition/photopolymerization process at the nanoscale, it is shown how the presence of the polymer leads to a decrease in Voc and an increase in Jsc, contrary to what is usually reported in the literature. Then, by varying certain experimental parameters, it is shown that this trend can be reversed and that the long term stability of the resulting cells is affected. This study joins others recently published with the aim of disproving some clichés in the field of DSSCs. These clichés have often been proved to be wrong, having been derived from measurement errors38,39 or from the increasingly widespread trend of justifying experimental data by simply citing papers published by other scientists, quite often on different systems.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Bisphenol A ethoxylate dimethacrylate (BEMA, average Mn: 1700), poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA, average Mn: 500), sodium iodide (NaI), iodine (I2), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), acetonitrile, chloroform (CHCl3), ethanol and acetone were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 2-Hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenyl-1-propanone (Darocur® 1173) from Ciba Specialty Chemicals was used as the free radical photoinitiator. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plates (sheet resistance 7 Ω sq−1, purchased from Solaronix) were cut into 2 cm × 2 cm sheets and used as substrates for the fabrication of the photoanodes and platinized counter electrodes. The sensitizing dye cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719, Ruthenizer 535 bis-TBA) was purchased from Solaronix.
2.2. Preparation and characterization of polymer electrolytes
A 35:65 weight ratio of the two liquid monomers, BEMA and PEGMA, was selected. They were easily mixed together with the photoinitiator (3 wt%). Such a reactive mixture was electrodeposited onto DSSC photoanodes by means of a NANON-01A electrospinning machine purchased from MECC. It was equipped with a syringe pump setup (that can operate at a flow rate between 0.1 and 99.9 mL h−1) and a high voltage power supply (HVU-30P100, whose operating voltage can vary from 0.5 to 30 kV). The reactive mixture was introduced into a syringe (6 mL) connected with a needle (27 gauge × 15 mm). The voltage applied from the tip of the needle to the grounded plate collector was equal to 21 kV, while the distance between the tip of the needle and the collector was 15 cm. The intensity of the applied electric field was calculated as ΔV/d = 21 kV per 15 cm ≅ 1.4 kV cm−1. Such a value guaranteed the deposition of the UV-curable reactive mixture. The BEMA/PEGMA formulation had a low viscosity, thus an electrospray process, leading to the formation of charged drops instead of a continuous charged polymeric jet (typical of a standard electrospinning process), was employed. During electrodeposition, the photopolymer precursor was exposed to UV-light (35 mW cm−2, as measured by means of a UV Power Puck® II radiometer, EIT) coming from a medium pressure mercury lamp equipped with an optical guide (LC8, Hamamatsu).
The gel content (crosslinked fraction) was determined on thicker light-cured samples prepared on microscope slides by measuring the weight loss after 24 h extraction in CHCl3 at room temperature, according to the standard test method ASTM D2765-84. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the UV-cured polymers was measured with a differential scanning calorimeter 204 F1 Phoenix® (Netzsch) instrument, equipped with a low temperature probe, over a temperature range of −65 to +70 °C under N2 flux at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The thermal stability of the UV-cured samples was tested by thermo-gravimetric analysis, with a TG 209 F1 Libra® (Netzsch) instrument, over a temperature range of 25–600 °C under N2 flux at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The morphology of the polymer-coated TiO2 photoelectrodes was investigated by means of a ZEISS Auriga Dual Beam system.
2.3. Fabrication and characterization of DSSCs
The front electrodes were prepared by depositing a single layer of mesoporous TiO2 on the top of conductive substrates (previously cleaned with acetone and ethanol) using a screen printer instrument (AT-25PA, Atma Champ Ent. Comp) with a 43 T mesh frame. After deposition, the samples were heated at 100 °C for 10 min and then sintered at 525 °C for 30 min. The fabricated electrodes, whose thicknesses were measured by profilometry (P.10 KLA-Tencor Profiler), were then soaked overnight in a 0.35 mM ethanolic N719 dye solution. Finally, the electrodeposition/photopolymerization process of the UV-curable monomers was performed as described above. Concerning the counter electrode preparation, 5 nm Pt thin films were deposited by sputtering (Q150 T ES, Quorum Technologies Ltd) onto cleaned FTO glasses. The cells were assembled by means of a microfluidic architecture developed in our laboratories,40 whose details are given in the ESI.† Photocurrent–photovoltage curves were measured using a Keithley 2440 Source Measure Unit under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) provided by a Newport 91195A class A solar simulator (calibrated through a Newport 91150 V silicon reference solar cell). The active area of the cells was defined as 0.16 cm2 using a black mask. Impedance spectroscopy measurements were carried out in dark conditions using an Autolab PGSTAT128 potentiostat equipped with a FRA32M module. The bias voltage was kept constant at cell open circuit values, while the superimposed sinusoidal signal had an amplitude of 10 mV and a frequency variable in the range 0.1 Hz–30 kHz.
3. Results and discussion
In order to study the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface at the nanoscale, a reactive mixture, containing a photoinitiator and two low molecular weight monomers, was electrodeposited on a TiO2 electrode sensitized with the standard metal–organic dye N719. The conditions of the electrodeposition process (detailed in Section 2.2) allowed for perfect infiltration of the reactive mixture within the mesopores of the nanostructured electrode. Moreover, the electrodeposition was performed in combination with low intensity UV irradiation (Fig. 1A), so as to crosslink the monomers in very close contact with the photoanode nanoparticles. Due to the high photoreactivity of the two monomers, bisphenol A ethoxylate dimethacrylate (BEMA) and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA),34 their photoinitiated curing was completed within a few seconds, without forcing the photoanode to bear long UV irradiation times or thermal polymerization steps which could be potentially detrimental to the dye molecules. The particularly favorable (for DSSC application) physico-chemical and thermal properties of this polymer are thoroughly detailed in Fig. S1 and 2 in the ESI.†
 Fig. 1  (A) Experimental setup for the electrodeposition/photopolymerization process; (B) FESEM image of a BEMA/PEGMA-covered TiO2 photoanode when te = 20 s; (C) te = 45 s and (D) 80 s are also reported with their corresponding inset views. 
The electrodeposition time (te) was varied from 0 to 80 s, thus polymeric layers with different thicknesses were obtained. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was useful to estimate such thicknesses by means of comparing the TiO2 nanoparticle size before and after the electrodeposition/photopolymerization process. The sample prepared with te = 20 s showed polymeric layers with a thickness of around 5–10 nm, but a great discontinuity in the BEMA/PEGMA macromolecular network was observed in several areas of the photoelectrode, as shown in Fig. 1B. By increasing te to 45 s (Fig. 1C), a perfect 20–25 nm-thick coating of the TiO2 nanoparticles was observed, which would be ideal for their application in DSSCs and, in particular, to maximize the dye regeneration process by means of a close contact between the sensitizer molecules and the polymer electrolyte. Upon further increasing te (to 80 s), the polymeric shell around the TiO2 nanoparticles reached 80–110 nm and some BEMA/PEGMA aggregates were observed on the top of the photoanode (Fig. 1D). In summary, careful tuning of the electrodeposition time allowed us to obtain perfectly uniform and aggregate-free light-cured coatings for te values between 45 and 60 s.
The advantage of this adopted preparation technique and of the selected monomers is that both the permeation of the nanostructured photoanode and the formation of an extremely thin polymer coating around the TiO2 nanoparticles were obtained; furthermore, the whole process took less than a couple of minutes, while catalysts, solvents or thermal steps were not required for the formation of the crosslinked polymer.
The coated photoanodes and Pt-sputtered counter electrodes were assembled in DSSC devices by means of a smart microfluidic architecture developed in our laboratories (see Section 2.3).40 A liquid electrolyte composed of NaI (0.45 M), I2 (0.056 M) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (0.55 M) dissolved in acetonitrile41 was introduced into the sealed cells. Such an electrolyte was able to fill the space between the two electrodes, permeating the three-dimensional polymeric network, and finally reaching the chemisorbed dye molecules. After this activation process with the I−/I3− redox mediator, the nanosized polymeric film turned into a true polymer electrolyte. Its effective penetration in the mesoporous photoanode was assessed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). To this end, TiO2 films with various thicknesses were screen-printed on Pt-coated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates and the charge transport resistance at the Pt/electrolyte interface (RCE) was measured.42 As shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI,†RCE values remain nearly constant with increasing film thickness up to 9 μm, thus indicating that the UV-curable monomers present an efficient penetration in this film thickness range. For greater thicknesses, the RCE gradually increased, which meant that monomer penetration into the nanostructured electrode became more difficult. Therefore, photoanodes with a thickness equal to 8 ± 0.25 μm were used for the fabrication of the DSSCs reported in this work.
Photocurrent–photovoltage curves measured under 1 sun irradiation are reported in Fig. S5 in the ESI,† while the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The duration of the electrodeposition process of the UV-curable reactive mixture strongly influenced the cells parameters, as can also be appreciated from Fig. 2. It is possible to distinguish two regimes for each photovoltaic parameter, with a reversal in the observed trend occurring when te exceeded 60 s. The most significant part of these graphs, which are also useful for understanding the effect of the polymer electrolyte in the DSSC, is the part at low electrodeposition times. In this range, an increase in Jsc and a decrease in Voc were observed. This behavior is in contrast with those of other quasi-solid polymer electrolytes reported in the literature.35 In other words, we show how the establishment of a polymer–photoanode interface does not always lead to a photovoltage increase. To explain this trend, a likely scenario is based on the fact that the polymer–TiO2 interaction results in a downshift of the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor. Consequently, the driving force for the electronic injection from the excited sensitizers to the TiO2 CB increases, and the photocurrent follows the same trend. However, this polymer–TiO2 interaction also causes the TiO2 CB level to approach that of the redox potential of the I−/I3− mediator, with a consequent decrease in Voc.

Reversal of this trend was observed when the thickness of the polymer electrolyte was increased by employing longer electrodeposition times. Indeed, for processes longer than 60 s, an increase in Voc and a decrease in Jsc were observed. In this context, the effect of the polymer matrix changed completely and a pure steric effect became predominant. In fact, a thick crosslinked polymeric layer can hinder the approach of I3− ions towards the photoanode, thus preventing charge recombination between the injected electrons and the acceptors in the redox mediator. The effect of this filtering results in a decrease in recombination phenomena at the electrode/electrolyte interface, thus leading to increased photovoltage values. However, even a decrease in the photocurrent was observed when prolonged electrodeposition times were adopted. This adverse effect was caused by the fact that the mobility of the I− ions (necessary to regenerate the oxidized dye molecules) met an increased diffusion resistance due to the presence of a thick polymeric network around the photoanode nanoparticles. Such a steric effect was in contrast to and predominant over the above reported Jsc increase caused by the displacement of the TiO2 CB.
The above reported hypotheses were successfully confirmed by EIS analysis performed on complete DSSCs. The Nyquist plots of the impedance of the different cells measured in dark conditions at the open circuit voltage are shown in Fig. 3. The typical spectra obtained for DSSCs, constituted by two main arcs,43 can be clearly observed (a third arc is not visible due to low frequency limitations). The high frequency arcs, which are related to the electrolyte/counter electrode interface, are not significantly different for the different cells. This result is to be expected, since this interface is identical for all the analyzed DSSCs. On the contrary, the presence of the polymeric network around the TiO2 nanoparticles strongly affects the photoanode/electrolyte interface. In particular, the charge transfer resistance RR (being roughly the width of the middle-frequency arc, measured on the real part of the Nyquist plots,44) experiences a decrease upon increasing the electrodeposition time to 60 s, and then starts increasing for longer te values. Since this resistance is associated with the recombination of charges,45 it can be concluded that the presence of the polymeric shell increases the back reaction, thus contributing to the reduction of the open circuit voltage, in accordance to what is reported in Fig. 2B. When the thickness of the polymer layer becomes sufficiently large, an effective shield against electron–hole recombination is formed, and the RR (and Voc) values increase. On the other hand, in the Nyquist plots, the imaginary part of the impedance Z′′ is related to the capacitive behavior of the interface, which in the case of photoanode/electrolyte double layer is often referred to as chemical capacitance Cμ,46 and this was found to be related to the CB density of states (DOS).47 In Fig. 3, the trend observed for the middle frequency arc widths is also reflected in their heights, meaning that an enlargement of the chemical capacitance occurs when the nanoparticles are covered by the polymer. Indeed, the accumulation of charges at this interface induces a downward shift of the TiO2 CB of the semiconductor, which is responsible for the enhancement of the photocurrent (see Fig. 2A for comparison).46 As reported above, for te values larger than 60 s, the limited mobility of the I− ions makes the number of holes at the interface lower, and this is reflected in a reduction of the chemical capacitance values.

In order to pass from a qualitative analysis to a quantitative one, the impedance spectra were fitted through an equivalent circuit.48 The calculated curves are shown in Fig. 3, superimposed on the experimental data. By exploiting the fitting procedure, RR and Cμ = (QμRR)1/β/RβR (where β is the constant phase element index48) were obtained for all the cells, and their values are reported in Fig. 4 as a function of the electrodeposition time. In accordance with the discussion above, the same trends can be observed by comparing Fig. 4A with Fig. 2A and Fig. 4B with Fig. 2B, respectively: a larger chemical capacitance reflects a higher current, while a reduced recombination resistance implies a lower open circuit voltage. Despite a RR value of 48 Ω, a large 2.4 mF value was obtained for the Cμ of the cell fabricated with 60 s of polymer deposition, which is characterized by the largest photocurrent and efficiency values (see Table 1).

The present findings are in contrast to some typical clichés present in the literature. For example, Yang et al. reported that a polymer electrolyte can increase the Voc by reducing the dark current thanks to its polymer chains covering the TiO2 electrode surface.35 However, this group used high molecular weight poly(methyl methacrylate) for their study, which is unable to permeate and uniformly cover the nanostructured photoanode. Similarly, Lee et al. used poly(styrene) beads with a mean size of 250 nm, and the improved photovoltage was attributed to the passivating effect of the TiO2 surface promoted by the polymer.49 However, it is really unlikely that 250 nm-sized nanoparticles were able to effectively cover a thick electrode consisting of 20 nm-sized TiO2 nanoparticles. A different explanation for the improved Voc values is usually given for biopolymeric electrolytes. For example, Huang et al. reported that their electrolyte, consisting of modified hydroxypropyl cellulose, gave a Lewis acid–base interaction with the TiO2 electrode, so that the trap states of the latter were shielded by the biopolymer chains and the recombination rate was reduced.50 However, the critical point is still the same: a swollen hydroxypropyl cellulose matrix with a molecular weight of 100000 cannot interact (especially by means of atomic Lewis acid–base interactions) with a nanostructured electrode. Other studies explained the enhancement of Voc by a negative shift of the TiO2 CB (the opposite to that observed in this work).51 However, in those cases a concentrated poly(ethylene oxide)-based gel electrolyte was used, which was recently demonstrated not to be able to penetrate the photoanode when high molecular weights are adopted.36 The extreme case of these questionable explanations occurs when crosslinked polymer electrolytes are prepared ex situ and then interposed between the electrodes: the far-fetched explanation in this case, as has often been reported, is that the voltage increase can occur through the wrapping of the TiO2 nanoparticles and enveloping of the dye molecules by the polymer segments, thus consequently hindering the back electron transfer.52 It is immediately obvious to the reader that a polymer electrolyte membrane that has simply touched the photoanode cannot wrap the nanoparticles, contained in a 10 μm-thick photoelectrode, one-by-one! Therefore, a careful analysis of the preparation methods of the electrolytes and cells must be carried out before accepting all the claims proposed by each scientific group.
The long-term stability is another factor to be considered when evaluating the performance of a polymer electrolyte-based DSSC. It has often been noticed that increasing both the molecular weight of the polymer and its quantity with respect to that of the redox mediator solution help to increase the cell durability.53 In contrast, quasi-solid cells assembled with a minimum amount of polymer dissolved in the redox mediator solution have shown higher efficiencies but poor long-term stability.54 In this regard, it is useful to remember what the causes of rapid aging of these photoelectrochemical devices in the liquid state are: (i) evaporation of some electrolyte components (solvent, additives); (ii) the resulting creation of photoanode areas that are not regenerated anymore by the redox mediator; (iii) other secondary factors (photo-degradation and corrosion of the cell components).55 If attention is focused on the first two points, it is intuitive that preparing a polymer electrolyte capable of efficiently trapping the redox mediator solution is not difficult, while it is not easy to guarantee that such an electrolyte will remain in contact with the entire photoanode nanostructure for a long time, thus ensuring the consistent and complete regeneration of the dye molecules over a prolonged period.
To the best of our knowledge, the literature does not report any study that correlates the penetration of a quasi-solid electrolyte in the photoanode with the cell stability. However, our electrodeposition/photopolymerization system allows us to deposit low molecular weight monomers onto TiO2 nanoparticles and then crosslink the system, thus ensuring a stable and complete coating. As reported above, all the presented samples showed the same monomer penetration in the nanostructured photoanode, but had different thicknesses depending on the electrodeposition time. In order to assess the long-term stability of the fabricated DSSCs, a 1000 h ageing test was carried out at a temperature of 60 °C under dark conditions, and the cells were tested every 50 h. The resulting curves, shown in Fig. 5, show that the reference liquid cell was able to retain less than 70% of its initial efficiency after aging. This finding is consistent with those usually reported in the literature for liquid lab-scale cells,56 and also confirms the tendency of liquid electrolytes not to be able to provide stable long-term performance. In contrast, the quasi-solid DSSCs presented in this work showed a reduced decay from their initial efficiency. This means that the polymeric shell around the photoelectrode effectively retains the redox mediator in the proximity of the dye molecules, thus guaranteeing their continuous regeneration. Furthermore, Fig. 5 shows that increasing the electrodeposition time increases the stability of the cells. In other words, while keeping the degree of electrode permeation constant, the additional thickness created by the electrodeposition/photopolymerization process allows trapping of a greater amount of redox mediator within the thicker 3D polymer network, thereby lowering the volatility of the electrolyte components. However, such a stability improvement reached a plateau when te = 60 s. Indeed, cells treated for 60 and 80 s showed a similar decay (2–3%) from their initial efficiency, meaning that further polymer addition was not useful in improving the long-term stability. Therefore, 60 s was confirmed to be the best te value since it was able to ensure at the same time the best efficiency and better stability of the resulting device. This fact is truly innovative and challenging, since the literature often presents a considerable imbalance between electrolytes containing small or large amounts of polymeric matrix, resulting in hardly comparable efficiencies and stabilities. On the contrary, the preparation method presented in this work allows for simultaneous study of these two parameters that, together with the low cost of the UV-induced process, represent the golden triangle in the field of DSSCs.

4. Conclusions
A combined electrodeposition/photopolymerization approach has been presented to introduce low molecular weight monomers within the mesopores of DSSC photoanodes, followed by the in situ crosslinking of the polymeric matrix. A study at the nanoscale allowed us to investigate what the real effects are – caused by the presence of a polymer electrolyte – that regulate the cell parameters in a quasi-solid DSSC, while disproving many implausible explanations given in the literature. Furthermore, by combining the photovoltaic, electrochemical and aging data, the existence of an optimal quantity of polymeric matrix able, at the same time, to ensure the fabrication of efficient and stable devices was demonstrated for the first time ever.
