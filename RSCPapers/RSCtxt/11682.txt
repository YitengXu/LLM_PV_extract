    , Accepted 14th October 2020First published on 14th October 2020AbstractNaphthalenediimide (NDI) based copolymers have been widely used as n-type materials in organic field-effect transistors and organic solar cells due to their good electron-accepting abilities and high electron mobilities. However, electron transport mechanisms for these copolymers remain elusive. In particular, whether intra-chain or inter-chain electron transfer controls the transport performance is debated. Here, we have investigated the intra-chain conformations, inter-chain stacking structures, and electron transport properties in a series of NDI based copolymers using oligothiophenes (OT) as donors by means of multiscale theoretical simulations. The results indicate that these copolymers exhibit large twists between the NDI and OT units and tortuous backbone conformations, causing the intra-chain electron transfer to be dominated by the super-exchange (SE) couplings between adjacent NDI units with taking the in-between OT unit as a bridge. Also, the twisted intra-chain geometries prevent long-range ordered inter-chain packing. Consequently, neither intra-chain nor inter-chain electron transfer can individually form a continuous transport network. However, NDI units have plenty of inter-chain short contacts and the combination of intra-chain and inter-chain couplings results in a robust percolation network for efficient electron transport. In addition, the electron mobility can be improved by balancing the intra-chain SE couplings and inter-chain direct couplings with an appropriate donor length.
Introduction
Organic π-conjugated donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers have displayed great potential in organic optoelectronic devices, such as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic solar cells (OSCs).1 Charge transport plays a critical role in determining the operation and performance of these devices, and it is highly desirable to improve the charge carrier mobilities. Generally, for high-mobility polymers, the conjugated backbones should be as planar as possible to increase intra-chain charge transport directly and inter-chain charge transport via improved packing order and crystallinity.2–6 Nevertheless, an overwhelming number of naphthalenediimide (NDI) based copolymers have been developed by taking different donor units including a series of oligothiophenes (OT).7–16 Despite the large torsion angles between the NDI and donor units (>40°),17–19 these D–A copolymers show electron mobilities as high as ∼1 cm2 V−1 s−1 measured using OFETs and ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 when using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.20–22 In particular, P(NDI2OD-T2) with bithiophene as the donor unit (labelled as NDI-2T here, see Fig. 1) has been widely used as an electron acceptor in all-polymer OSCs and obtained a high power conversion efficiency over 11%.22–26 It should be noticed that the electron mobilities of NDI-2T can be significantly changed by the molecular weights and processing solvents,21,27,28 indicating that inter-chain packing could play an important role in determining the charge transport properties. On the other hand, efficient charge transport was found for amorphous or low-concentration NDI-2T films.29 This implies that the charge transport might be controlled by intra-chain rather than inter-chain electron transfer, namely, the inter-chain short contacts seem sufficient for efficient charge transport. Therefore, efficient electron transport mechanisms are still debated for NDI-based D–A copolymers.

Because of the strong electron-withdrawing ability of NDI and large backbone torsions, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which mediates electron transfer, should be localized on the NDI units for the NDI-based copolymers (Fig. S1, ESI†). Consequently, both intra-chain and inter-chain electron transport in these polymers can be described using the hopping model, namely, electrons migrate through continuous hopping among the NDI units.30 Because the intra-chain adjacent NDI units are spatially separated by the donor units, the direct electronic couplings are negligible and the super-exchange (SE) couplings must be considered with the donor units as a π-bridge. Recently, the SE charge transfer mechanism has been manifested in a number of systems, such as π-bridged perylenediimide compounds, D–A mixed-stack molecular crystals as well as D–A copolymers.31–35
It should be noted that a number of π-conjugated polymers including NDI-based copolymers were observed to have crystalline packing in thin films.18,36 Their precise packing structures could be resolved by molecular simulations with carefully re-parameterized force fields in contrast with the experimental measurements via X-ray scattering, solid-state NMR, and UV-vis spectroscopy.37 This is very helpful to establish a reliable correlation of electronic and charge transport properties with molecular structures. Nonetheless, the semicrystalline films must contain a major portion of amorphous regions, especially for polymers with highly twisted backbones. Besides, the overall charge transport performances are limited and determined mainly by amorphous regions with relatively poorer mobilities rather than crystalline regions with better mobilities.
Herein, to gain an in-depth understanding of the origin of efficient electron transport in amorphous NDI-based copolymers, we have investigated the polymer chain conformations, inter-chain stacking structures, and electron transport properties for a series of NDI-based copolymers with different lengths of OT as the donor units (see Fig. 1) using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations (see the computational details in the ESI†). The results show that, because of the very twisted backbone and tortuous conformations, continuous charge transport cannot occur merely through either intra-chain or inter-chain electron transfer. However, benefitting from the large number of inter-chain short contacts for NDI units in combination with effective intra-chain SE electron transfer, a robust percolation network can be formed to achieve highly efficient electron transport. Moreover, since the intra-chain SE electron transfer and inter-chain direct electron transfer are well balanced by an optimal donor length, NDI-2T exhibits the highest electron mobility among the studied NDI-based copolymers.
Results and discussion
To preliminarily evaluate intra-chain electron transport properties, we optimized the geometric structures of NDI-OT-NDI triads and estimated the direct and SE couplings between the NDI units using DFT calculations. There are two local minimum configurations for the adjacent NDI and thiophene units (the dihedral angle α, around 45° or 120°) or the adjacent thiophene moieties (the dihedral angle β, around 30° or 160°), which is consistent with the previously calculated results and vibrational spectroscopy measurements.18,37 Consequently, the NDI-OT-NDI triads have many local geometries. Fig. 2 shows the lowest-energy geometries and the electronic couplings for electron transfer between NDI units for the triads. It is found that the donor lengths have little influence on the intra-chain dihedral angles. As expected, because the NDI units are spatially separated by the donor units, the direct couplings (Vdrt) appear to be vanishingly small. In contrast, the effective SE couplings (Veff) are very significant. As the number of thiophene units is increased from 1 to 4, Veff is decreased from 96.6 to 23.0 meV, which is similar to DTDPP based copolymers.32 Considering that the relative energies are very close for different local geometries, Fig. S2 (ESI†) displays the electronic couplings for the highest-energy local geometries with a reverse configuration for every dihedral angle. Since all the dihedral angles between the adjacent NDI and thiophene units or between the adjacent thiophenes get relatively more perpendicular, Veff for the highest-energy geometries are decreased (11–44 meV), but remain around one half of those for the lowest-energy geometries. To understand the different SE couplings among the NDI-OT-NDI triads, we analyze the contribution of each molecular orbital of the OT donor. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), Veff is controlled by a few essential OT orbitals, and the main contribution comes from the interaction between the NDI LUMO and the LUMO and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of OT. When the OT length is increased, the electronic densities on the linking carbon atoms for the HOMO and LUMO of OT are substantially decreased, leading to a reduction in the direct couplings of the NDI LUMO with the OT orbitals and thereby Veff, although both the HOMO and LUMO energies of OT get closer to the NDI LUMO.

To further uncover the polymer conformations and inter-chain packing structures in solid films and their influence on the intra-chain and inter-chain electron transfer, atomistic MD simulations were performed to obtain the molecular packing morphologies of the four NDI based copolymers, according to a quasi-equilibrium strategy to imitate the solvent evaporation process.38–40 Here, each simulated film contains 50 polymer chains with 8 repeat units in each chain. To obtain a more reliable description of the backbone conformations and inter-chain interactions, the inter-ring torsion potentials were re-parameterized according to DFT calculations (Fig. S4, ESI†). The distributions of the polymer backbone dihedral angles (α and β) extracted from the four simulated films are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The dihedral angles show a very broad distribution due to the thermal fluctuation effect and inter-chain interactions, whereas the positions at the maximum distribution correspond well to the potential energy surface minima, i.e., ca. 45° and 120° for α and ca. 35° and 150° for β. As a result, the intra-chain Veff exhibit a large range of distribution (Fig. S6a, ESI†). The average intra-chain Veff in the films are provided in Table 1, which show a similar decreasing trend with the number of thiophenes in OT. Because of a large distribution around 90° for the α dihedral angle, the average intra-chain Veff are smaller than those for the DFT-optimized geometries (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2, ESI†). Nonetheless, even for NDI-4T, the average intra-chain Veff is larger than 5 meV, which can bring about fairly good intra-chain electron transfer.

Now it is desirable to evaluate the polymer backbone ductility to determine whether intra-chain electron transfer is enough for charge transport throughout the devices.41 The ductility can be estimated by the radius of gyration (Rg) and the root-mean-square end-to-end distance (RMSD). The Rg and RMSD values for the polymer chains in the films show a broad distribution (Fig. S7, ESI†) and the average values are substantially smaller than the max values (Table S2, ESI†). As the number of thiophenes in OT is increased, the distribution becomes broader. These results indicate that the polymer chains have rich conformations and most of them are distorted. The shortest, medium, and longest conformations were then extracted from the MD simulated morphologies (Fig. S8, ESI†) and are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The backbone conformations for all the NDI based copolymers appear to be quite tortuous, making it difficult to accomplish charge transport only through intra-chain electron transfer, especially for the coil conformations.42 Besides, the distorted conformations of the polymer chains are unconducive to form long-range ordered inter-chain packing.
The overall inter-chain packing structures can be characterized by center-of-mass (COM) radial distribution functions (RDFs).38,39,43 As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), no obvious RDF peak is found for the NDI–NDI and NDI-thiophene pairs in the films of the four NDI based copolymers, indicating that there are no preferential relative orientations and long-range ordered inter-chain packing for the NDI units. When the COM distance is less than 0.5 nm, the NDI–NDI or NDI-thiophene pairs can be roughly regarded as π–π stacking (see representative structures in Fig. 3a). As expected, all four copolymers have very few NDI–NDI π–π stacking, but the number of NDI–NDI π–π stacking is continuously increased with the OT length (Fig. 3b), which is consistent with red shifts in the long-wavelength UV-vis absorption in experiments.9 Relatively, more NDI-thiophene π–π stacking is found because there is no alkyl side chain on thiophenes. Furthermore, the inter-chain short contacts for NDI are counted according to the nearest distances between heavy atoms. As shown in Fig. 3c, the average number of NDI neighbours per NDI unit can be quite large, reaching ca. 0.26 for NDI-1T and ca. 0.37 for other copolymers with longer OT donors at a cutoff distance of 0.35 nm, and surpassing 0.6 at 0.5 nm for all the copolymers. This means that inter-chain short contacts between NDI units can play an important role in inter-chain electron transfer, which is similar to the intermolecular electron transfer in the dimeric perylenediimide derivatives.35,39 It should be noted that at most three consecutive inter-chain NDI–NDI short contacts can be observed (Table S3, ESI†), indicating that there is no long-range inter-chain packing and it is also difficult for the charge transport only via inter-chain electron transfer.

Based on the extracted inter-chain NDI–NDI pairs (the shortest inter-atom distance <0.5 nm), the direct electronic couplings (Vdrt) for inter-chain electron transfer were calculated, which also exhibit a broad distribution (Fig. S6b, ESI†). In contrast to the intra-chain Veff, the average inter-chain Vdrt are slowly increased from 17.1 to 24.3 meV with the donor unit length (Table 1). Interestingly, the inter-chain Vdrt and intra-chain Veff are well balanced for NDI-2T. Besides, the presence of a large number of A–D π–π stacking and short contacts in the copolymers with a long OT unit (Fig. 3d) can promote inter-chain electron transfer through super-exchange couplings. We then calculated the inter-chain Veff for the NDI-OT-NDI triads with the nearest inter-atomic distance >0.5 nm between two NDI units and <0.5 nm between the NDI and OT units. The inter-chain Veff are appreciable (Fig. S6c, ESI†) and the average values reach 1.2–1.5 meV (Table 1).
At this stage, we would like to analyze the mesoscopic electrical connectivity by using the calculated electronic couplings.44 When the electronic coupling is larger than a given threshold value (VT) and the NDI LUMO energy difference is smaller than 0.3 eV, the related two NDI units are regarded as electrically connected. Then the percolation networks can be obtained according to the connected NDI units. The number of networks (Nnet) and the number of NDI units in the largest network (Nmax) can be used to describe the mesoscopic electrical connectivity and its robustness. Generally, the less Nnet and the more Nmax, the better connectivity across the bulk. As shown in Fig. 4, Nnet is increased and Nmax is decreased with the VT value. Consistent with the distorted intra-chain conformations and short-range inter-chain packing, Nnet is very large and Nmax is very small when considering only the intra-chain connections or the inter-chain connections. Notably, after taking both the intra-chain and inter-chain connections into account, Nnet is substantially decreased and Nmax is significantly increased. The max network includes more than 320 NDI units (80%) at VT = 2 meV or 200 NDI units (50%) at VT = 3 meV. This implies that the connected NDI units can form a robust percolation network across the bulk which is beneficial for efficient electron transport. At VT = 3 meV, Nnet follows the trend NDI-1T ≈ NDI-2T < NDI-3T < NDI-4T and NDI-2T exhibits the largest Nmax (NDI-2T > NDI-1T > NDI-3T > NDI-4T), so NDI-2T would show the best transport capability among the four copolymers. To intuitively visualize the contributions of intra-chain and inter-chain connections, the max connection networks are illustrated in Fig. 5. It can be clearly seen that both intra-chain and inter-chain connections are indispensable for charge transport across the whole bulk and they are intermixed with each other in the percolation network. Because of the enhanced inter-chain couplings and reduced intra-chain couplings, the proportion of inter-chain connections is gradually increased with the OT length. As VT is increased from 2 to 4 meV, NMAX is decreased sharply for NDI-4T while being relatively very slow for the other systems.

The solid lines denote Nnet and Nmax obtained by considering both intra-chain and inter-chain connections, while the dash and dot lines denote those obtained by considering only the intra-chain and inter-chain connections, respectively.

The green balls denote the center of mass of the NDI units, whereas the blue and red lines represent the intra-chain and inter-chain connections, respectively. 
Finally, the electron mobilities of the four copolymers were estimated by using KMC simulations in combination with the semi-classical Marcus electron transfer theory,45 as in our previous works.38,39,46,47 As shown in Fig. 6, the calculated mobilities are of the same order of magnitude of 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 as the experimental measurements.22 As expected, with the increasing number of thiophenes in OT, the electron mobility is firstly increased and then gradually decreased, and NDI-2T has the highest mobility due to the most balanced intra-chain and inter-chain electron transfer capabilities. Compared with NDI-2T, the lower mobility of NDI-1T is ascribed to the much less inter-chain NDI–NDI short contacts, although it has the strongest intra-chain Veff. From NDI-2T to NDI-3T and NDI-4T, while the inter-chain NDI–NDI short contacts and Vdrt remain similar or are slightly increased, the intra-chain Veff is steadily decreased, leading to a reduction of mobility. In addition, the inter-chain Veff can indeed improve the electron mobilities, especially for the copolymers with a longer donor unit. For instance, the mobility of NDI-4T is increased twice after considering the inter-chain Veff. This can be mainly attributed to the sharply increased number of inter-chain Veff when elongating the donor unit although their values are small.

Conclusions
In summary, NDI based copolymers show very twisted backbone conformations and the inter-chain NDI units are packed through short contacts; thus, neither intra-chain nor inter-chain electron transfer can accomplish electron transport across the whole bulk. However, both the intra-chain super-exchange couplings and the inter-chain direct couplings for electron transfer are quite strong, and a robust percolation network can form by combining the intra-chain and inter-chain connections, which contributes high electron mobilities for the NDI based copolymers. In addition, as the number of thiophene units in the OT donor is increased, the intra-chain super-exchange couplings become weaker while the inter-chain short contacts are enhanced. Therefore, the intra-chain and inter-chain electron transfer can be well balanced by tuning the donor unit lengths, and the highest electron mobility is obtained for NDI-2T. Moreover, the inter-chain super-exchange couplings can increase the electron mobilities, especially for the copolymers with a longer length of donor units. This work sheds light on the origin of high electron mobilities for the very twisted copolymers based on NDI and would be helpful for the development of amorphous high-mobility organic semiconducting materials.

 	Fig. 3  (a) Illustration of representative inter-chain π–π stacking modes (all alkyl chains are replaced by methyl for clarity); (b) average number of π–π stacks; (c) average number of neighbouring NDI units as a function of the inter-chain NDI–NDI distance and (d) average number of neighbouring OT units as a function of the inter-chain NDI-OT distance for every NDI unit (the distances are measured as the shortest distance between heavy atoms).	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Number of networks (Nnet) and (b) number of NDI units in the largest network (Nmax) as a function of electronic coupling threshold (VT). The solid lines denote Nnet and Nmax obtained by considering both intra-chain and inter-chain connections, while the dash and dot lines denote those obtained by considering only the intra-chain and inter-chain connections, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 5  Illustration of the max connection networks with the electronic coupling threshold (VT) set as 2 meV (a), 3 meV (b), and 4 meV (c). The green balls denote the center of mass of the NDI units, whereas the blue and red lines represent the intra-chain and inter-chain connections, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 6  Electron mobilities calculated with or without (w/o) considering the inter-chain super-exchange couplings.
