    , Accepted 5th May 2021First published on 6th May 2021AbstractA novel concept of Na-based dual-ion batteries (Na-DIBs) has been designed via a perovskite K0.79Ni0.25Co0.36Mn0.39F2.83@reduced graphene oxide (KNCMF@rGO) hetero-nanocrystal anode, showing surface conversion and insertion hybrid mechanisms. The KNCMF@rGO//graphite (KS6) DIBs deliver superior energy/power densities and cycling stability and have a significant impact on developing energy storage devices.
With the shortage and exhaustion of various energy sources, the research on wind and solar energy is attracting more attention. However, considering sustainability, researchers have to develop alternative sustainable and clean energy. Meanwhile, some new types of energy storage systems such as metal-ion batteries, metal-ion capacitors and metal–air batteries have also been extensively researched. Nevertheless, there are some characteristics of these energy storage systems, for example, metal-ion batteries have higher stored volume and gravimetric energy density, but they are restricted by the discovery of cheap and abundant new cathode materials;1 metal-ion capacitors can deliver high-power density but the redox reaction kinetics of the electrode is slower than that of the non-faradaic capacitive counterparts;2 and theoretically, the energy density of metal–air batteries is high, about 3–30 times that of Li-ion batteries, however, due to the challenges associated with metal anodes, air cathodes, and electrolytes, they are not reaching their full potential.3 For these reasons, researchers need to look for a new type of energy storage system. Dual-ion batteries (DIBs) are considered as the next generation batteries due to their high cell voltage, simple design, and sustainable, available, and feasible raw materials.4
Initially, the DIBs were developed from dual-graphite batteries (DGBs) or dual-carbon batteries (DCBs), which means that DIBs use graphite or carbon as the electrode material at the two poles. During the charging/discharging process, cations and anions insert/extract into/from the graphite layer of the two electrodes, respectively.5 In recent years, many DIBs based on Li+ using non-graphite as anode materials have been reported, such as, WS2-graphite,6 Si-graphite,7 core/shell aluminum@carbon nanospheres,8 and NaNbO3-graphite,9etc. It is worth nothing that the balance between the supply and demand of Li resources can be crucial, as the consumption of Li will account for 1/3 of the world's total consumption by 2050.10 So, we can turn to the research of DIBs based on Na+. DIBs based on Na+ storage materials are rarely reported because of the absence of suitable anode materials for insertion/extraction of Na+ (as the radius of Na+ (1.02 Å) is larger than that of Li+ (0.76 Å)).
Herein, a new perovskite fluoride material as a DIB anode based on Na+ is studied in this work. The crystal structure of perovskite fluorides (ABF3, A = K, Na, H2O, NH4+, etc.; B = Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, etc.) is stable. When the A or B particles of the metal are replaced by other metal ions, the crystal structure will not change fundamentally, while other properties are improved. The perovskite type fluorides have strong architecture, crossed tetragonal cavity chains and inherent three-dimensional (3D) diffusion channels. Due to the high ionic and strong electronegative species of the M–F bond, perovskite type fluorides show high redox potential, high energy density, and excellent cycling stability.11 Therefore, they can potentially serve as Na+ storage anodes. As anodes, the perovskite fluorides have been researched (Na0.85Ni0.45Co0.55F3.56,12 KNi0.1Co0.9F3,11 KCo0.54Mn0.46F313 and K1.1Zn0.17Mn0.83F3.0314) for Li-ion capacitors (LICs), Li-ion batteries (LIBs), and Li-ion dual-ion batteries (Li-DIBs) so far. Differently, we first report polymetallic atom doped perovskite fluoride K0.79Ni0.25Co0.36Mn0.39F2.83@reduced graphene oxide (KNCMF@rGO) containing K+ and F− vacancy defects for a Na-DIB anode. Due to the existence of cation (K+) vacancies, this special structure can adapt to the volume expansion caused by Na+ inserted/deintercalated during the reversible charge and discharge process.15 The anion (F−) vacancies in KNCMF@rGO can promote the diffusion of Na+.16 Hence, the K and F vacancies can provide excellent performance with high rate and long-term cycling. The KNCMF@rGO anode has showed surface conversion and insertion hybrid mechanisms and pseudocapacitive–diffusion mixed kinetics. The fabricated KNCMF@rGO//graphite (KS6) Na-DIBs exhibit remarkable behavior.
The XRD patterns of the KNCMF@rGO samples (Ni:Co:Mn = 1:0:0/0:1:0/0:0:1/1:1:1) are demonstrated in Fig. 1, in which the patterns of the KNiF3@rGO, KCoF3@rGO, and KMnF3@rGO samples correspond with the cubic KNiF3 (PDF#21–1002), KCoF3 (PDF#18–1006), and KMnF3(PDF#17–0116) standard patterns with pm3m space group, respectively. The ideal KMF3 perovskite structure shows that the F contains M ions (MF6), which form a three-dimensional cubic lattice through angular connection (the crystalline structures of KMF3 and crystalline parameters of KNiF3, KCoF3, and KMnF3 can be seen in Fig. S1, ESI†). The diffraction peaks of the KNCMF@rGO exhibit a negative or positive shift with the increase or decrease of the Ni/Co/Mn ratios, and the (110) crystal plane of these samples can be well observed. The main reason for the peak shift is the partial substitution of Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+ sites in the KNCMF structure, which indicates the successful synthesis of Ni/Co/Mn doping perovskite fluorides.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of KNF@rGO, KCF@rGO, KMF@rGO, and KNCMF@rGO samples. 
Fig. S2a, b and S3 (ESI†) exhibit a polyhedral nanocrystal morphology with the size of 20–500 nm and show a thin transparent nanosheet with an amorphous carbon structure of the KNCMF@rGO by SEM and TEM. The HRTEM in Fig. S2c (ESI†) illustrates a d-spacing value of 0.41 nm for the marked (100) crystalline plane, which is between the corresponding values for KNiF3 (0.402 nm) and KMnF3 (0.4191 nm), and the d-spacing value of the (002) plane of rGO is 0.52 nm. The randomly distributed local defects are visible as some dark spots can be observed in Fig. S2c (ESI†), which might be the missing K or F atoms.17 The SAED in Fig. S2d (ESI†) exhibits polycrystalline diffraction characteristics, and the standard crystal planes are (100), (110), (111), and (200), etc., indicating the typical cubic perovskite structure of the sample KNCMF@rGO, and this result is in good agreement with XRD. Additionally, some diffraction spots are enlarged in Fig. S2d (ESI†), which arises from the structural defects.18 Fig. S2e–l (ESI†) illustrate the mapping of the KNCMF@rGO sample with a scanning scale level of 5μm, which indicates a uniform distribution of K, F, Ni, Co, Mn, C, and O elements. The EDS (Fig. S4, ESI†) indicates the presence of Ni, Co, Mn, K, F, C, and O elements. The K/Ni/Co/Mn/F ratios of the KNCMF@rGO sample are determined as 0.79/0.25/0.36/0.39/2.83 by ICP–OES (Fig. S5, ESI†), which slightly deviates from the theoretical values of 1.00/0.33/0.33/0.33/3.00. And it shows that there are K+ and F− vacancies in the perovskite structure. According to the principle of electric neutrality, the ratio of M2+/M3+ is 0.96/0.04, and the formula can be further resolved as K0.79M(II)0.96M(III)0.04F2.83@rGO, M = Ni, Co, and Mn. From the TG curve (, Fig. S6, ESI†) of mass loss at 200–600 °C, it can be inferred that the mass percentage of rGO in the KNCMF@rGO sample is 14.4%, and a main DTG peak is observed at 428 °C. The nitrogen sorption isotherms in Fig. S7 (ESI†) show a meso/macro-hierarchical porous nature (2.05, 30.85, and 52.39 nm) with a specific surface area and pore volume of 25.3344 m2 g−1 and 0.247233 cm3 g−1.
During the first discharging process in Fig. 2a, the cathodic peaks at around 0.1–0.3, 0.6–1.2, and 1.8–2.0 V can be attributed to the Na+ intercalations into the KNCMF@rGO, the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) films and irreversible conversion reactions with the products of Ni, Co, Mn, KF, and NaF; during the first charging process, the anodic peaks at around 1.4–1.7 and 2.2–2.5 V can be ascribed to the Na+ extraction out from the KNCMF@rGO, the reversible conversion of Ni, Co, and Mn metals to NiF2, CoF2, and MnF2 and the partial decomposition of SEI films.19,20 In the following cycles, the cathodic peak shifts to C (1.2–1.5 V) while the anodic peaks basically remain at A (1.6–1.8 V) and B (2.4–2.5 V), revealing the conversion–insertion hybrid mechanisms of the KNCMF@rGO. For the storage of Na+, the reversible interfacial Na+ intercalation in the Ni, Co, Mn, and NaF matrix in the low potential region may contribute to the storage capacity of Na+;21 Na+ inserts/extracts through the large pores of the rGO nanosheets and adsorbs/desorbs on/out of the graphene sheets increasing the Na+ storage capacity of KNCMF@rGO.22 Fig. S8 (ESI†) illustrates the first three CV plots of the KNF@rGO, KMF@rGO, and KCF@rGO electrodes at 0.3 mV s−1. The cathodic/anodic peaks during the discharging–charging processes of the KNF@rGO (1.2–1.5 and 1.2–1.5/2.5–3.0 V), KCF@rGO (0.9–1.2 and 0.7–1.2/1.9–2.3 V), and KMF@rGO (0.8–1.0 and 1.6–1.8 V) in Fig. S8a–c (ESI†) are roughly similar to those of the KNCMF@rGO electrode. In (Fig. 2b), the GCD process occurs in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V and the discharge capacity is 787 mA h g−1, and the initial Coulombic efficiency of KNCMF@rGO is only about 25%. There are three possible solutions to improve the first cycling Coulombic efficiency: (1) carbon coating;23 (2) changing the electrolytes;24 and (3) using interfacial catalysis to tune the SEI film formation.25 For the first cycle, low discharged plateaus around 1.22, 0.53, and 0.14 V are observed at 0.02 A g−1, which corresponds with the CV plot. The specific capacity and cycling stability (Fig. 2c and d) of the KNCMF@rGO exhibit the performance (208.4–43.9 mA h g−1/0.02–1.0 A g−1/66% retention/500 cycles/0.3 A g−1). In Fig. S9 and Table S3 (ESI†), the KNF@rGO shows high specific capacity and poor cycling performance compared to other candidates; the KCF@rGO and KMF@rGO show relatively stable cycling performance; and the KNCMF@rGO shows better comprehensive electrochemical performance, which is largely owing to the optimal synergistic effect of Ni, Co, and Mn electroactive sites. In Fig. S10b, c and Table S3 (ESI†), the KNMF@rGO(Ni:Mn = 1:1) shows a relatively high rate capability and cycling stability compared to the other electrodes. To further gain insight into the electrochemical kinetics of the KNCMF@rGO, Fig. S12a (ESI†) shows the CV plot at scan rates of 0.1–1.0 mV s−1. A fluctuation at 0.25 V in the CV curve at 1.0 mV s−1 is due to the slow kinetics and poor reversibility of the sodium deposition at higher sweep speed. The slopes of the lg i−lg v plots of the KNCMF@rGO (Fig. S12b, ESI†) for the two anodic peaks and the cathodic peak are 0.71–0.84. Fig. S12c (ESI†) shows that about 52% of the total capacity of KNCMF@rGO is attributable to a hybrid battery-capacitive storage feature. The proportion of pseudocapacitive contribution at 0.1–1.0 mV s−1 can be shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). The surface capacitive contributions of the materials can be seen in Fig. S12d (ESI†). The pseudocapacitive charge storage has obvious advantages at higher scan rate which endows the KNCMF@rGO with excellent electrochemical performance. There are three types of pseudocapacitive mechanisms: (1) underpotential deposition; (2) redox pseudocapacitance; (3) intercalation pseudocapacitance. The KNCMF@rGO electrode material belongs to redox pseudocapacitance and this material has also been termed extrinsic pseudocapacitance which is due to the fast kinetics of nanostructuring.26

The conversion–insertion hybrid mechanisms of the KNCMF@rGO electrode for Na-ion storage were revealed by ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). Fig. S14a (ESI†) depicts the survey of XPS spectra of the pristine, fully discharged/charged to 0.01/3.0 V states. In Fig. 3a, at a much lower binding energy in comparison with the pristine state, the Ni 2p of the fully discharged/charged states shows new shoulder peaks. In (Fig. 3b), the Co 2p of the fully discharged/charged states show negative shifts (−4.0/−2.5 eV for 2p3/2; −4.5/−3.6 eV for 2p1/2) in comparison with the pristine state and the Mn 2p of the fully discharged/charged states show negative shifts (−3.7/−2.0 eV for 2p3/2; −5/−2.1 eV for 2p1/2) in comparison with the pristine state in (Fig. 3). That indicates the presence of Ni, Co, and Mn metal phases during the discharging/charging processes.12–14 And during the low-voltage discharge progress, the electrochemically reduced Ni, Co, and Mn metal nanoparticles can store numbers of spin-polarized electrons, which results in a large excess surface capacitance.27 The peaks of Co 2p3/2/Co 2p1/2 of the fully charged states are more positive (+1.5/+0.9 eV) than the discharged state but close to the pristine state, and the peaks of Mn 2p3/2/Mn 2p1/2 of the fully charged states are more positive (+1.7/+2.9 eV) than the discharged state but close to the pristine state. That indicates Na-ion insertions in the KNCMF@rGO electrode dominated by the Co and Mn sites due to the K-ion vacancies.28 The F 1s spectra (Fig. 3d) reveal the NazKMF, K–F, Na–F, M–F, K–M–F (M = Ni, Co, and Mn), and F–C bonds in the fully discharged and charged states, while only M–F, F–C (from PVDF binder) and K–M–F bonds can be resolved for the pristine state, indicating the existence of NazKMF, K–F, NaF, and MF2 species in the reactions. The K 2p3/2/K 2p1/2 spectra (Fig. 3e) of the fully charged states are more positive (+1.6/+1.7 eV) than the discharged state but close to the pristine state, and it shows the K–M–F bonds at the pristine state, due to the processes of insertion and conversion reactions, the NazKMF and K–F can be resolved, respectively, in the fully discharged and charged states. The XPS shift is a characteristic shift to the Fermi level. The K and F vacancies aggrandize the equilibrium electron density, thus pushing the Fermi level upward. The increased binding energies can be observed in Table S5 (ESI†) compared with some systems without vacancies.29 The Na 1s signals (Fig. 3f) of the fully discharged and charged states come from the NazKMF (Na+ insertion in KMF), NaF and Na2CO3 (from SEI films). The C 1s/O 1s spectra (Fig. S14b and c, ESI†) for the fully discharged/charged states show the signals of C–C, C–O, C–O–C, C–OH, CO, ROCO2Na, Na2CO3, and C–F that are the sign of SEI film formation, in addition, CC, C–C, C–O, CO, and HO–CO in C 1s and CO, C–O–C, and C–OH in O 1s are from rGO. Fig. S15 (ESI†) shows the pristine and fully discharged/charged state XRD signals of the KNCMF@rGO, where the structure becomes very faint and the peak positions changed slightly (−0.04°/−0.02°) for discharge and charge in enlarged peaks of the (110) planes accompanying some small news of certain phases in comparison with the pristine state, indicating the conversion–insertion reactions. Based on the above analysis, conversion–insertion hybrid mechanisms of the KNCMF@rGO electrode proposed with partial reversible reaction of the SEI film along with an intercalation reaction of Na+ within M (M = Ni, Co, Mn)/NaF matrix and the spin polarization surface capacitance at the metals (Ni, Co, Mn)/NaF interface in the low potential range, and Na+ insertion into rGO can be deduced in eqn (S1)–(S7) (Fig. S16c, ESI†) (schematics of the processes are listed in Fig. S16a and b, ESI†).

Na-DIBs were assembled with the KNCMF@rGO anode and KS6 cathode (Fig. S17, ESI†). Fig. 4 shows the electrochemical performance of the KNCMF@rGO//KS6 Na-DIBs with m−:m+ = 1:1.5–1:1–1.5:1 under room temperature (25 °C). Fig. 4a shows the CV curves of different quality ratios at 10 mV s−1 and exhibits approximate triangle shapes with slight redox peaks/plateaus in the potential range of 0.5–5.2 V, suggesting typical battery behavior. Fig. 4c, d and Table S6 (ESI†) exhibit advanced energy/power densities and cycling stability with the anode pre-sodiation at 0.05 A g−1 and the ratio of m–:m+ = 1:1 exhibits better properties (229.64–16.96 W h kg−1/0.84–6.1 kW kg−1 with 60% retention/100 cycles/2 A g−1/25 °C) than the other two ratios (1:1.5 and 1.5:1). The KNCMF@rGO//KS6(1:1) Na-DIBs exhibit the excellent performance at −20 °C and at 40 °C (Fig. S19, S20 and Table S7, ESI†). Based on the results (Table S8, ESI†), the KNCMF@rGO//KS6(1:1) Na-DIBs showed advanced energy/power densities and cycling stability, comparable to or even better than many of the most advanced systems.

In summary, the vacancy defective perovskite KNCMF@rGO anode is introduced for advanced Na-ion storage systems with surface conversion–insertion and pseudocapacitive-diffusion storage hybrid mechanisms. The designed Na-DIBs show outstanding performance in a wide temperature range. This work provides a new view to address the vacancy defective perovskite fluorides as an anode for Na-DIBs.
