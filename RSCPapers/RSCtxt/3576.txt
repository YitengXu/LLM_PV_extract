    , Accepted 3rd January 2023First published on 3rd January 2023AbstractThere has been rapid development of organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in recent years, but efficiency and stability challenges remain due to the massive defects in perovskite films. Here, the organic dye Th-azi-Pyr (ethyl 2-(2-(3-methyl-5-oxo-1-phenyl-1,5-dihydro-4H-pyrazol-4-ylidene) hydrazineyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophene-3-carboxylate) with carbonyl, pyrazolone structure, and benzene ring was synthesized and used to prepare high-quality perovskite film as an additive. Th-azi-Pyr formed relatively stable intermediate ligands with uncoordinated Pb and I, slowing the crystal growth and reducing the grain boundary defects of perovskite. In addition, the benzene ring in the dye protected against moisture and increased the stability of the perovskite film. Therefore, the Th-azi-Pyr-modified PSC assembled in an air environment exhibited a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.27%, which is superior to the 15.33% of the control PSC. Additionally, 88% of the original performance was maintained after 300 h at 25 ± 5 °C and 50 ± 10% relative humidity, implying that the modified PSCs exhibited greater stability than the untreated PSCs. This work indicates that simple and low-cost organic dyes are excellent defect passivators for high-performance PSCs.
1. Introduction
The organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite is the most promising material for solar cells due to its unique characteristics such as high carrier mobility, long carrier diffusion length, high defect tolerance, and low binding energy.1,2 This results in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) ranging from 3.8% to 25.7%.3–5 However, halide perovskite is sensitive to light, heat, and water, resulting in an unstable crystal structure, which limits increases to the PCE and the stability of PSCs as well as their scale-up fabrication.6,7
In the typical solution fabrication process for perovskite films, a large number of defects are usually formed due to their low binding energy (especially when under air conditions) during the process of crystallization.8,9 These defects mainly include leaving undercoordinated lead ions and dangling bonds at the grain boundary and surface defects caused by the terminal growth of perovskite crystals. Undesirable defects can lead to unfavorable carrier recombination and ion migration in perovskite films, which affects the efficiency or stability of devices.10,11 Therefore, to further improve the optoelectronic performance of perovskites and produce highly efficient and stable PSCs, many defect passivation methods have been developed to improve the quality of perovskite films, including solvent annealing,12 additive engineering,13 and surface modification.14 An additive strategy is simple, universal, and effective. Recently, scientists found that antisolvent treatment using small organic molecules or polymer molecules containing functional groups such as cyanogen (CN),14,15 carbonyl (CO),15,16 and sulfoxide (SO)17 can be used to inactivate electron-deficient Lewis bases.
Among the numerous additives, dye compounds are useful due to their multifunctional group structure and appropriate absorbance. Guo et al. introduced the natural organic dye indigo with carbonyl (CO) and amino (–NH2) groups as passivators into perovskite film, achieving a PCE of 23.22%.18 When Feng et al. used the aza-dipyrometene (aza-DIPY) dye molecule with pyrrole, benzene rings, and chlorine functional groups as additives, the average PCE of PSCs increased from 16.71% to 20.46%, with increased stability.19
Thus far, many studies have demonstrated that molecules containing amino, hydroxyl, carboxyl, carbonyl, and pyridine groups can act as passivators for defects in perovskite, thereby decreasing the non-radiative recombination. However, the development of defect passivation and stability for PSCs still faces a considerable challenge, in particular, under an ambient atmosphere, and therefore it is necessary to accurately design molecules to effectively passivate these defects.
In this work, a dye referred to as Th-azi-Pyr (ethyl 2-(2-(3-methyl-5-oxo-1-phenyl-1,5-dihydro-4H-pyrazol-4-ylidene) hydrazineyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophene-3-carboxylate) was synthesized that contains carboxyl (CO), a pyrazolone structure, and benzene ring, as shown in Fig. 1a. These can effectively control the surface morphology and suppress the defects in the perovskite films, thus promoting the formation of high-quality perovskite films and high-performance PSCs. As a result, the average PCE of Th-azi-Pyr-passivated PSCs fabricated under air conditions was as high as 19.27%. After being stored in ambient air (25 ± 5 °C, 50 ± 10% relative humidity) for 300 h, the PSCs based on Th-azi-Pyr-modified perovskite maintained 88% of their original PCE. This work demonstrates the potential applications of Th-azi-Pyr-based dyes in the fabrication of high-performance planar devices.

2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
FTO glass substrates were purchased from Advanced Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. Titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol) and isopropanol (IPA), acetone, and other solvents were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. PbI2, CH3NH3I (MAI), [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM, 99%), PEDOT:PSS, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxy-phenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD, 99.5%), lithium bis(trifleoromet-hanesulphonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corporation.
2.2. Preparation of Th-azi-Pyr

Diazotization reaction. 
Aniline (5 mmol), concentrated hydrochloric acid (3 mL), and water (2 mL) were added to a two-neck flask, and stirred vigorously for dissolution at room temperature. Then, the reaction flask was placed in an ice water bath to cool to approximately 0 °C. Next, a pre-prepared aqueous sodium nitrite solution (0.4 g NaNO2/3 mL dihydrogen oxide) was slowly added while maintaining the temperature at approximately 0 °C for 30 minutes. A starch potassium iodide test paper was used to detect whether there was excessive nitrous acid. If necessary, urea was added to remove any excess nitrous acid to obtain a diazonium salt solution.


Coupling reaction. 
1,2-Dihydro-5-methyl-2-phenyl-3H-pyrazol-3-one (5 mmol) and water (5 mL) were added to a three-neck flask. Then, sodium bicarbonate was added to maintain the pH value of the aqueous solution at 8–9 during the dropping process (the reaction flask was placed in an ice water bath to cool to approximately 0 °C). After the sodium bicarbonate addition, the mixture continued to react for 3 h until the reaction finished. After the reaction, the pH value of the solution was adjusted to neutrality by the addition of hydrochloric acid solution (2 mol L−1). The mixture was left to stand, and then suction-filtered. Finally, the reaction product was dried in an oven at 60 °C to obtain the target product. The product was a red power (0.86 g) with a yield of 70%. The NMR data are as follows: 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 14.7 (s, 1H), 8.01 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.40 (dd, J1 = J2 = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.18 (dd, J1 = J2 = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 4.45 (q, J = 8 Hz, 2H), 2.80 (dd, J1 = 8.0 Hz, J2 = 4.0 Hz, 2H), 2.67 (dd, J1 = 4.0 Hz, J2 = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 2.33 (s, 3H), 1.84–1.78 (m, 4H), 1.58 (s, 3H), 1.41 (dd, J1 = 8.0 Hz, J2 = 4.0 Hz, 3H). The corresponding 1H NMR spectrum is shown in Fig. S1.†

2.3. Fabrication of the perovskite solar cell

The planar heterojunction PSCs were fabricated according to our previous work20,21. 
The FTO glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in acetone and absolute ethanol, each for 15 min. Then, the substrates were pre-cleaned with isopropanol (IPA). Before deposition of the TiO2, the substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 15 min. Next, 70 mg and 150 mg of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) were each added to ethanol (1 mL) to form TiO2 solutions. A compact TiO2 layer (70 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto clean FTO substrates at 2000 rpm for 20 s, and subsequently annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. Next, a more compact TiO2 layer (150 mg mL−1) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 20 s, annealed from 20 °C to 450 °C (86 min in total) at the rate of 5 °C min−1, heated at 450 °C for an additional 30 min, and then cooled.
As shown in Fig. 1b, the perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving PbI2 (461 mg) and MAI (159 mg) in mixed solvent dimethylformamide (DMF, 600 mg) and DMSO (78 mg). Afterwards, the perovskite solution was spin-coated onto the FTO/TiO2 substrate at 2000 rpm for 10 s, and then 4000 rpm for 25 s. At 10 s before the end of spin-coating, different amounts of Th-azi-Pyr were added to ethyl acetate (EA) to form a mixed antisolvent solution (0 mg mL−1, 0.5 mg mL−1, 1.0 mg mL−1, and 1.5 mg mL−1), which was then dripped onto the spin-coating substrate and annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, 60 μL of spiro-OMeTAD solution, which consists of 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD powder, 28.8 μL of tBP, and 17.5 μL of Li–TFSI solution in 1 mL of chlorobenzene, was spin-coated onto the top of the perovskite films at a rate of 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 80 nm Ag was evaporated on the hole-transporting layer and served as a top electrode. The PSC with the structure of FTO/TiO2/Th-azi-Pyr-perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag is shown in Fig. 1c, and its active area was 0.06 cm2. All devices were assembled in an air environment (30–40% relative humidity) at room temperature (20–25 °C).

2.4. Measurement and characterization
Top-view and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a field emission scanning electron microscope (Ultra55, ZEISS). The crystal structures of MAPbI3 films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Thermo ARL-X′ TRA) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The elemental chemical states of perovskite films were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-Alpha) with the Fermi edge as the energy benchmark. Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) measurement was carried out using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 900). The transient-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) were recorded by a PG2000-Pro-EX spectrophotometer (Shanghai Ideaoptics Corporation) and transient fluorescence spectrometer (FLS980, Edinburgh Instruments), respectively. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were acquired with a Bruker VERTEX 70 in the range of 4000–500 cm−1. Water-contact-angle images of MAPbI3 films were obtained by a contact-angle instrument (Krȕss Optronic). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using an electrochemical workstation (Zennium Pro). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs were tested by a source meter (Keithley 2400-SCS) under AM 1.5 illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
To study the influence of the Th-azi-Pyr additive on device performance, the J–V curves of PSCs with and without Th-azi-Pyr were measured, as shown in Fig. 2a. Compared with the control PSCs, the PSCs with various concentrations of Th-azi-Pyr exhibited higher power conversion efficiencies. As the amount of Th-azi-Pyr increased, the PCE increased, reaching the highest values at 1 mg mL−1 and then gradually decreasing. The PSC with 1.0 mg mL−1 Th-azi-Pyr displayed the most optimal PCE of 19.27% in the reverse scan, with a JSC of 23.24 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.091 V, and a FF of 75.58%. In contrast, the control PSC displayed a PCE of 15.33%, with a JSC of 21.71 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.022 V, and a FF of 69.09% under reverse scan. Additionally, the hysteresis index (HI) of the PSCs treated with Th-azi-Pyr was significantly reduced compared with the control PSCs (Fig. 2b and Table S1†).

As illustrated in Fig. 2c, in order to verify the authenticity of the PCE, the steady-state efficiency was measured by applying a constant voltage of 0.88 V. A stable photocurrent density of 23.24 mA cm−2 and stable PCE of 19.03% were obtained, but the control device acquired a photocurrent density of 20.94 mA cm−2 and stable PCE of 15.13%. The results were very similar to the PCE obtained by J–V characteristics. The devices with 1 mg mL−1 Th-azi-Pyr produced the highest PCE, with an overall increase in JSC, VOC, and FF (ESI, Fig. S2†), indicating that the moderate amounts of additive maximized the impact on PSC performance. The lower PCE with 1.5 mg mL−1 was due to the poor perovskite crystallization and smaller grains (ESI, Fig. S3–S4†).22,23 Therefore, the optimum concentration of Th-azi-Pyr additive was determined to be 1 mg mL−1, and this concentration was used for all the following tests.
With the aim of understanding the enhancement mechanism of Th-azi-Pyr on the photoelectric properties of PSCs, some measurements were carried out. First, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to determine the electronic state of elements to obtain the chemical composition changes on the surface of perovskite films and the chemical interactions between Th-azi-Pyr and perovskite. The S-element of Th-azi-Pyr powder, control perovskite film, and Th-azi-Pyr-based perovskite film were used. After Th-azi-Pyr treatment, the S signal peak appeared in the Th-azi-Pyr-based perovskite film, indicating that Th-azi-Pyr molecules were successfully introduced into the perovskite film (Fig. S3†).24
As shown in Fig. 3a, after careful comparison of the Th-azi-Pyr powder and Th-azi-Pyr-based perovskite film, the binding energy of the S 2p1/2 for the Th-azi-Pyr-based perovskite film shifted from 164.0 eV to 164.1 eV, and the binding energy of S 2p3/2 shifted from 165.1 eV to 165.15 eV, illustrating the chemical interaction between S and perovskite. According to previous reports, this spectral peak shift indicates the formation of Pb–S.25Fig. 3b depicts the two main peaks at 138.20 eV and 143.05 eV of the pristine perovskite film, which were ascribed to the Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 level. With the incorporation of Th-azi-Pyr, the Pb 4f binding energy shifted to 138.03 eV and 142.88 eV, respectively.

As indicated in Fig. 3c, the XPS signals of I 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 of the Th-azi-Pyr-modified perovskite layers also moved to a slightly lower binding energy compared to those without the Th-azi-Pyr modification. Characteristic peaks at 401.65 eV for the control perovskite film and 401.45 eV for the Th-azi-Pyr-based perovskite film are shown in Fig. S4.† The N 1s signals shifted to a slightly lower binding energy after Th-azi-Pyr modification, indicating the interaction between the –NH and perovskite surface (halide I−) via hydrogen bonding, which was helpful to passivate defects.26 For the perovskite film with Th-azi-Pyr, the characteristic binding energy peaks of Pb (Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2) and I (I 3d3/2 and 3d5/2) moved to a lower binding energy compared to the control perovskite film, which indicated the chemical interaction between the Th-azi-Pyr and the perovskite.
According to previous reports,27 this Pb shift might be attributed to the coordination bond between O and Pb via Lewis based-acid interaction between the CO bond of Th-azi-Pyr and the Pb2+ in the perovskite film.28 From the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy spectra (Fig. 3d), the CO peak displayed a blueshift, indicating that the CO of Th-azi-Pyr possibly interacted with some component of perovskite.26 From the above results, the passivation mechanism of Th-azi-Pyr is shown in Fig. 3e, and indicates that the carbonyl group and S atom interact with Pb2+, and the –NH interacts with perovskite via hydrogen bonding, which further passivates ionic defects in the perovskite film, providing a bifunctional passivation impact for perovskite.
To confirm the influence of Th-azi-Pyr on the morphology of perovskite films, the SEM is illustrated in Fig. 4. With addition of Th-azi-Pyr into perovskite films, obvious changes in the perovskite grain sizes can be observed in Fig. 4 and Fig. S6 (ESI†). After treatment with Th-azi-Pyr, the perovskite films presented more uneven crystal grain sizes, but the larger the crystal grain size, relatively speaking, the fewer grain boundaries and fewer defects.
 Fig. 4  Surface and cross-sectional SEM images of (a and c) untreated and (b and d) Th-azi-Pyr-treated perovskite films. 
The grain sizes of perovskite significantly increased to 522 nm from 402 nm, implying that the amount of grain boundary was obviously reduced. From the cross-sectional SEM, the control perovskite layer displayed the same thickness (≈400 nm) after Th-azi-Pyr treatment. The larger grain sizes and more uniform morphology indicated fewer grain boundaries and pinholes, which would contribute to reducing the defect density, inhibiting non-radiative carrier recombination, and improving the carrier transfer characteristics, thus improving the device performance and stability.8
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed and is shown in Fig. 5a to illustrate the facet orientation of the Th-azi-Pyr-incorporated perovskite. The diffraction peaks of the perovskite films with and without Th-azi-Pyr were located at 14.20°, 28.52°, and 32.0°, and correspond to the (110), (220), and (310) planes, respectively.29,30 There was no peak shift and no new peaks appeared, which indicated that Th-azi-Pyr did not cause the formation of impure phases in perovskite films.31 Careful comparison of the (110) diffraction peak indicated that the peak intensity of the Th-azi-Pyr-based perovskite film was the strongest, and narrowest at full width half maximum (FWHM), as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), implying a higher crystallinity of the perovskite films. These results showed that the Th-azi-Pyr additive can play an important role in improving the crystallinity and facilitating crystal growth of larger grain sizes (Fig. S7, ESI†).
 Fig. 5  (a) XRD patterns of the perovskite films with and without Th-azi-Pyr. (b) UV-Vis absorption spectra, (c) PL spectra, and (d) TRPL spectra of the perovskite films with and without Th-azi-Pyr. 
The corresponding UV-Vis absorption spectra are presented in Fig. 5b. The absorption intensity was high for the perovskite films, in the visible light range of 400–800 nm,32 and there were no distinct differences in the light absorption bandgap between the untreated and Th-azi-Pyr-treated perovskite films (Fig. S9, ESI†). Notably, the absorption intensity of Th-azi-Pyr-based perovskite films was slightly higher than that of the original perovskite films due to the satisfactory absorption ability of dyes in the visible light region (Fig. S10, ESI†),33 which was beneficial for enhancing the current density of PSCs.
To further demonstrate the influence of Th-azi-Pyr on the photoelectric properties of the perovskite films, the steady photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained, and the corresponding results are presented in Fig. 5c and d. The PL intensity of the Th-azi-Pyr-modified perovskite film was nearly three times stronger than that of the control perovskite films, implying lower non-radiative recombination induced by the incorporation of Th-azi-Pyr.34,35 In addition, a slight blueshift of the PL peak was observed from 766 to 763 nm for the Th-azi-Pyr-treated perovskite film, which implied that the trap density can be reduced by effectively passivating or suppressing defects in perovskite film.36,37 To analyze the TRPL spectra, a bi-exponential model was used to fit the PL decay to obtain information about the charge carrier dynamics. The carrier lifetime can be calculated by eqn (1):38 (1)
The rapid lifetime was related to the nonradiative recombination at the surface defect, and the slow lifetime was related to the radiative recombination in the bulk perovskite film. The average lifetime (τave) of the perovskite film was calculated from eqn (2): (2)
For the pristine perovskite, the τ1 and τ2 were 166 ns and 4 ns, respectively, resulting in a τave of 161 ns. After incorporation of Th-azi-Pyr, the τ1 and τ2 increased to 226 ns and 5 ns, respectively, corresponding to a τave of 222 ns. The extended lifetime implied that the Th-azi-Pyr treatment would promote the transmission of charge carriers and reduce non-radiation compound loss, further suggesting that the defect density was decreased.39
To validate the reduction of the trap-state density in perovskite layers, the defect density of perovskite in electron-only devices (FTO/TiO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag) was calculated by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) technique.40Fig. 6a shows the dark current–voltage properties of the devices fabricated using the perovskite films without and with Th-azi-Pyr treatment. The defect density was obtained by measuring the trap-filling limit voltage (VTFL), which was an intersection between ohmic and TFL fitting curves. The trap density (Nt) was estimated from the VTFL using eqn (3):41 (3)where e denotes the elementary charge, L denotes the thickness of the perovskite film, ε0 denotes the vacuum permittivity, VTFL denotes the trap-filling voltage, and ε denotes the relative permittivity of MAPbI3. The VTFL values of the perovskite films with and without Th-azi-Pyr were determined to be 0.26 V and 0.33 V, respectively. The Nt of the pristine perovskite layer was calculated to be 4.675 × 1015 cm−3, while after the incorporation of Th-azi-Pyr, the Nt was reduced to 3.683 × 1015 cm−3. The decrease in defect density induced by Th-azi-Pyr treatment was attributed to the effective passivation of the perovskite film by Th-azi-Pyr. A trap-free SCLC region was used to determine the charge mobilityt high bias, which was calculated using eqn (4):42 (4)

(b) Nyquist plots of electrical impedance spectra (EIS). (c) J–V curves of devices under dark conditions at a bias between −1.5 V and 1.5 V. 
It was calculated that the electron mobility of Th-azi-Pyr-based perovskite was 5.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1, which was higher than that of the control perovskite film (2.83 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1), indicating that the quality of the perovskite film had been improved. A pure-hole device (FTO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite (with and without Th-azi-Pyr)/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag) was constructed to elucidate the hole transport properties (Fig. S11†). The Nt of the Th-azi-Pyr-based perovskite film and the control perovskite film were 3.83 × 1015 cm−3 and 4.96 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. Accordingly, the hole mobility was 9.87 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1 for Th-azi-Pyr-based perovskite, which was much higher than that of the control perovskite film (7.85 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 S−1). The improvement of the defect density and carrier mobility implied that the Th-azi-Pyr could passivate the defects and enhance the charge transfer efficiency of perovskite films.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also conducted to provide insight into the charge transfer and recombination processes in PSCs. As displayed in the illustration of Fig. 6b, the model involves series resistance (RS) and composite resistance (Rct) in the high frequency region and low frequency region of EIS, respectively. After addition to Th-azi-Pyr, the radius of the traditional semicircle increased at low frequency. The higher Rct for the Th-azi-Pyr-modified perovskite film-based PSC indicated that the charge recombination rate decreased, and therefore supported the promoted VOC and FF.43 The dark J–V characteristics of the corresponding PSCs were measured and are presented in Fig. 6c. There were smaller leakage currents for the Th-azi-Pyr-passivated perovskite film-based devices as compared to the control devices, indicating the passivation of perovskite grain boundary defects with fewer electrons trapped by the traps,44 which verified the previous higher JSC, VOC, and FF.

Fig. 7a shows that there was a linear relationship between VOC and light intensity, and its slope represents the composite intensity inside the PSC. The traditional PSC possessed a slope of 1.46kT/q, whereas there was a smaller slope of 1.19kT/q for the PSC assembled by the Th-azi-Pyr-treated film, indicating that the trap-assisted recombination can be reduced, and the recombination strength can be minimized via the Th-azi-Pyr treatment. The corresponding incident photon–electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves are plotted in Fig. 7b. The IPCE spectra of PSCs with Th-azi-Pyr showed higher photon-to-current conversion efficiencies than the control PSCs in the wavelengths ranging from 450 to 800 nm. The integral current densities for the control PSC and the Th-azi-Pyr-containing PSC were approximately 21.85 and 23.22 mA cm−2, respectively, which was consistent with that of the JSC extracted from the J–V curves in Fig. 2a.

The inset of (c) shows the contact angle of a water droplet on the top of untreated and Th-azi-Pyr-treated perovskite films. 
Long-term stability of PSCs is necessary for their industrial application. Hence, we investigated the stability of the PSCs in a humid ambient environment. Fig. 7c demonstrated that there was greater stability for the device with Th-azi-Pyr as compared to the control cell at 25 ± 5 °C (humidity of 50 ± 10%) after aging for 300 h. The PCE of PSCs with Th-azi-Pyr treatment remained at 88% of its original efficiency, while the PCE of the untreated PSC was at 38% of its initial efficiency. This was ascribed to the decrease in the grain boundary density by Th-azi-Pyr and the increase in hydrophobicity by the presence of benzene rings.45,46 The water contact angle of the Th-azi-Pyr-treated perovskite film was 56.4°, which was larger than that of the perovskite film without Th-azi-Pyr treatment (47.0°). These results implied that a more hydrophobic membrane surface can be obtained by Th-azi-Pyr treatment. Thus, the surface passivation by Th-azi-Pyr was responsible for the increased stability,47 which was in satisfactory agreement with the previously described results.
4. Conclusions
A Th-azi-Pyr dye with carbonyl (CO), pyrazolone structure and benzene ring functional groups was synthesized and served as a multi-functional passivator to improve the stability and the performance of PSCs. The interaction between Th-azi-Pyr with uncoordinated Pb ions and I ions effectively passivated the defects at the grain boundaries, enhanced the crystallization quality of perovskite films, reduced the defect density, and restrained the carrier recombination of the PSCs. The PSC with Th-azi-Pyr achieved a higher PCE of 19.27% compared to the unmodified PSC (15.33%). Additionally, the Th-azi-Pyr-based PSC exhibited increased stability in air due to the improvement of the perovskite film quality and hydrophobicity, and the Th-azi-Pyr-based PSCs maintained 88% of the initial PCE after 300 hours in ambient air (25 ± 5 °C and 50 ± 10% humidity). Multifunctional dye molecules can conveniently and effectively assist in achieving high-performance PSCs and further developing PSCs with greater efficiency and stability.
