    , Accepted 15th September 2022First published on 19th September 2022AbstractSodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been rapidly developed as an effective replacement or supplement for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to the high natural abundance and low cost of sodium resources. Sodium super ion conductor (NASICON)-type materials have high ionic conductivity and excellent structural stability, making them one of the potential electrode candidates for SIBs. V(vanadium)-based polyanionic compounds have been the most extensively studied NASICON-structure materials. However, the environmental pollution and high-cost issues of V-based materials demand serious consideration. Currently, V-free NASICON-type electrodes have garnered a lot of attention. In this review, V-free NASICON electrodes for SIBs are first systematically summarized. The latest advances in related cathode/anode materials with various metal redox couples are classified and introduced in terms of their preparation method, structural characteristics, and electrochemical performance. Moreover, the performance improvement strategies and future prospects are discussed. It is expected that the insights may inspire future research into the development of more clean, efficient, and low-cost electrodes for SIBs.
1. Introduction
So far, energy supply remains largely reliant on fossil fuels. However, the widespread burning of fossil fuels emits a great deal of carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming.1,2 Therefore, it is urgent to develop and utilize clean, safe and sustainable renewable energy, such as solar and wind power. After nearly 30 years of development, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are being widely used in consumer electronics, electric vehicles, and renewable energy storage.3–5 They have the advantages of high energy density, long cycle life, low self-discharge rate, and no memory effect. Meanwhile, with the continuous diversification of secondary batteries, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as another promising rechargeable battery, which began in the 1980s and developed almost simultaneously with LIBs.6
More importantly, unlike the increasingly scarce lithium resources, sodium resources are cheaper, more abundant, and widely available around the world.7,8 However, because of Na's large ionic size (1.02 Å) and its relatively low standard electrochemical potential (∼2.71 V vs. Na+/Na) compared with Li (0.76 Å and 3.04 V vs. Li+/Li, respectively), low power and energy densities prevent the further development of SIBs.9,10 In the past few years, as electrodes for SIBs, a wide range of new materials has been introduced and evaluated. Similar to LIB chemistry, layered and polyanionic compounds have been extensively studied as cathode materials, and carbon-based materials, metal oxide compounds and metals have been studied as anode materials.11–14 In just a few years of research, electrode materials with different redox potentials and capacities have been discovered, some of which have achieved energy densities comparable to those used in LIBs.15 Overall, these two secondary batteries complement each other, and related electrode materials are continuously researched and updated to improve performance.
Sodium super ion conductor (NASICON) structured materials have a good structure and good ionic conductivity, resulting in particular attention.16,17 Na1+xZr2P3−xSixO12(0 ≤ x ≤ 3) was the first known NASICON as a typical solid electrolyte.18,19 The NASICON structure is characterized by the formula of AxMM′(XO4)3, and there are some possible elements in NASICON-type materials (Fig. 1a): A = Li, Na, K, Mg and Ca, M or M′ = Fe, V, Ti, Zr, Sc, Mn, Nb and In, X = S, P, Si and As. In the NASICON structure, the XO4 tetrahedra, representing a lantern-shaped basic unit, share all their corners with the MO6 and M′O6 octahedra.20,21 As each lantern is attached to six others, a large interstitial space is generated, which can hold 0 to 5 alkali cations per structural formula. The alkali cation numbers depend on the oxidation states of M and M′ as well as on the element X.22 NASICON compounds of the same composition may exhibit different crystal structures: rhombohedral (r-) and monoclinic (m-) structures as shown in Fig. 1b and c. For the rhombohedral structure, the M–M′ dimers ([MO6]2[XO4]3) are well aligned along the c-axis, whereas the M–M′ dimers of the monoclinic structure display a zigzag alignment. Therefore, the same element composition may show different electrochemical behaviors.

The NASICON-type materials have numerous advantages, including ion conductivity, safety, structural stability, etc., which make them potential candidates for SIBs.23–26 NASICON structured materials serve as cathodes, anodes and electrolytes. For example, Na3V2(PO4)3 has attracted much attention as an electrode material due to its excellent properties.27–29 This material has a theoretical capacity of ∼117.6 mA h g−1 in the potential range of 2.4 to 3.7 V, and the (PO4)− is covalently bonded leading to a very strong and stable framework and hence to a long-term cyclability. Moreover, at 3.4 V and 1.6 V, the redox potentials correspond to V4+/V3+ and V3+/V2+, respectively, making Na3V2(PO4)3 both a cathode and an anode.30 However, V2O5 is toxic as a precursor material for preparing Na3V2(PO4)3. Vanadium compounds range between high toxicity and moderate toxicity, among which vanadium pentoxide is the most toxic. Vanadium(V) is a rare metal with a high melting point. Vanadium compounds pollute the environment and can affect human health and cause acute and chronic poisoning. Environmental vanadium pollution mainly comes from vanadium mining and smelting, production of vanadium-containing alloy steel, organic and inorganic chemistry, glass and ceramic fabrication, textile, electronics, pigment, printing and dyeing, leather, paint, national defense and other industries, and can settle after diffusion, thereby polluting water sources, crops and pastures.31,32 In addition, vanadium can also be released in exhaust gases, ash, and soot from coal and oil combustion. These sources are therefore the most important sources of vanadium pollution in residential areas.33 Because of the above reasons, it is very meaningful to develop V-free electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries.
In recent years, NASICON-structured electrode materials for SIBs have developed rapidly. A summary of the published papers on vanadium-free/vanadium-containing NASICON-type cathodes and anodes for SIBs in the past ten years is shown in Fig. 2a, which suggests that the NASICON especially environment-friendly V-free SIB electrodes have attracted great and fast-growing interest. Typical V-free NASICON cathode materials like Na4MnCr(PO4)3,34 Na3Fe2(PO4)3,35 and Na3MnTi(PO4)3,36 have been studied extensively, and some electrochemical properties even exceed that of the V-containing NASICON cathodes. NaTi2(PO4)3 with a NASICON structure is gaining increased attention as a promising anode material due to its low cost, ‘zero stress’ framework, large theoretical capacity (133 mA h g−1) and high Na-ion conductivity.37–39 It can offer anode materials with excellent electrochemical performance, long-term cycling stability and better safety characteristics. Besides, some common transition metals such as Fe, Ti, Mn, Zr, Cr, and V were used in preparing the NASICON structures.40–43 Among them, the abundance of vanadium in the crust is near the lowest and vanadium has the highest price (Fig. 2b). The V content increases the cost of SIBs and hinders the development of SIBs in electrochemical energy-storage systems. Moreover, Fig. 2c summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of several common transition metal elements when used as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.44 Therefore, the environment and resource price should be considered comprehensively, and vanadium-free electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries should be developed vigorously.

In this review, the recent progress of vanadium-free NASICON as SIB electrode material is reviewed and its future development guidelines are discussed. We systematically summarize the crystal structure, sodium storage mechanism and electrochemical properties of a vanadium-free NASICON cathode and anode materials with different metal redox couples. It is believed that this review can provide readers with insight into the rationale and importance of vanadium-free NASICON electrode materials, which are expected to serve as powerful candidates for sodium-ion batteries.
2. NASICON electrode materials
Electrodes based on NASICON exhibit a wide range of electrochemical potentials, high ionic conductivity, and distinguished structural and thermal stability.45 First-principles calculations can be used to analyze the thermodynamic stability and the intercalation voltages of 3d transition metal-based NASICON phosphates, which have the formula NaxMM′(PO4)3 (with M and M′ = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni) and consist of (M, M′)O6 octahedral, PO4 tetrahedral units, vacancies and Na sites(Fig. 3a–d).46 As shown in Fig. 3e, the voltages of 28 plausible combinations of 3d TMs in NaxMM′(PO4)3 were consolidated with M and M′ in a 1:1 ratio. NASICON electrode materials tend to provide different electrochemical properties through redox reactions of transition metal elements, which can affect the charge/discharge voltage, capacity, cycle life and so on. Therefore, metallic redox couples can be used as a classification to summarize and discuss the structure and properties of the vanadium-free NASICON cathode and anode materials.

3. Cathode materials
3.1 Mnx+/Mny+ redox-couple based materials
Manganese-based NASICON structures can provide multiple redox couplings, such as Mn3+/Mn2+(∼3.5 V vs. Na+/Na) and Mn4+/Mn3+(∼4.0 V vs. Na+/Na), leading to multiple electron transfer.30,47 Therefore, these materials can provide superior energy density. Many manganese-based materials have been reported recently, such as Na3MnZr(PO4)3,48,49 Na3MnTi(PO4)3,50,51 Na4MnCr(PO4)3,52–54 Na4MnAl(PO4)355 and Na4Mn3(PO4)2(P2O7).56,57

3.1.1 Na3MnTi(PO4)3. 
Among different manganese-based NASICON materials, Na3MnTi(PO4)3 is one of the widely explored cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. In 2016, Gao et al. reported the application of Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (NMTP) in sodium-ion batteries.58 NASICON Na3MnTi(PO4)3 is composed of separated TiO6 and MnO6 octahedra, which share all angles with PO4 tetrahedra, and there is a large channel between them. The oxidation-reduction of transition metals is inductively controlled by strong covalent PO4 units. And, structural stability and intrinsic safety can be achieved with polyanionic phosphate even under high voltage conditions. In the framework structure, an immobile M1 atom is located at the gap site of six-fold coordination, and a reversible M2 atom is located at the gap site of eight-fold coordination. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, under different voltage windows, the number of redox pairs that can be excited is also different. It is well known that manganese-based polyanion compounds usually suffer from severe structural deformation during charge/discharge cycles due to the emergence of the Jahn–Teller effect.59,60 The incorporation of the titanium element can ensure that the fraction of Mn3+ in Na3MnTi(PO4)3 does not exceed 50% of the total position of transition metals providing benefits for the repeated extraction/insertion of sodium ions during the charging and discharging process, maintaining the stability of the NASICON structure.58 To further understand the structural changes of NMTP during the sodiation/desodiation processes, Zhu et al. performed in situ XRD tests.47 Two main changes in the diffraction peaks can be seen in Fig. 5a. One is the left/right shift of the diffraction peaks, indicating that a solid solution reaction occurred in the process. The second is the appearance/disappearance of diffraction peaks, indicating that a two-phase reaction occurred in the process. That is, the sodium storage mechanism of NMTP involves a solid solution reaction and two-phase reaction. Fig. 5b presents the structural changes of NMTP during charging and discharging. During the first desodiation process, two Na+ are removed from NMTP. During the subsequent sodiation/desodiation process, three Na+ are reversibly inserted into and extracted from the NMTP framework.47 Recently, Zhang et al. discovered a low discharge voltage plateau at around 2.5 V for NMTP, which not only leads to a decrease in capacity but also leads to severe voltage hysteresis.61 They believe that the voltage hysteresis is due to Na+/Mn2+ cation mixing. During the charging process, the Mn2+ located at the M1 site can be oxidized to Mn3+ or Mn4+, accompanied by a gradual decrease in the ionic radius, resulting in a strong mismatch between the large M1 cavity and the small Mn3+ or Mn4+ ions (Fig. 4c). As a result of this mismatch, the Mn3+ or Mn4+ cations may migrate to another more favorable thermodynamic site, such as the adjacent TM site. The migration of transition metal cations in layered electrode materials may lead to voltage hysteresis. Then, they successfully solved this problem by adopting a non-stoichiometric synthesis method. Comparing Fig. 4d and e, it can be clearly found that the discharge plateau at around 2.5 V has disappeared, and the gap between the charge and discharge curves has become smaller.

Although Na3MnTi(PO4)3 has the advantages of structural stability, safety and environmental protection, its low electronic conductivity limits its practical application.
Carbon compounding is an effective way to improve the electronic conductivity of materials.62,63 Zhu et al. synthesized reduced graphene oxide-coated NMTP microspheres by spray drying (Fig. 6a–c).64 Li et al. also synthesized reduced graphene oxide-coated NMTP microspheres by the sol–gel method(Fig. 6g).65 Due to the existence of a 3D conductive network structure, both the rate capability and long-term cycling performance of the electrodes are improved after doping carbon materials. And, Sun et al. synthesized NMTP and single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) composites by the sol–gel method.66 The morphology of the material was observed after charge–discharge cycles, and it was found that the structure of the material was basically unchanged(Fig. 6d), showing excellent structural stability. Li et al. successfully prepared Na3MnTi(PO4)3 particles embedded in N-doped carbon-based materials by a sol–gel method.67 N-doping introduces different N active sites and N vacancies, all of which are beneficial to the adsorption of sodium ions (Fig. 6e and f), reduce the energy barrier for the redox reaction of sodium ions through the carbon layer, greatly promote the storage process of Na and enhance the pseudocapacitive effect. In summary, the composite carbon material and NMTP particles are used to build a three-dimensional conductive network structure. Firstly, the introduction of carbon materials improves the electronic conductivity of the material. Secondly, the carbon layer strengthens the contact between the NMTP particles and the electrolyte, which is conducive to increasing the migration rate of Na+. Thirdly, an excellent carbon layer structure can mitigate the volume change to a certain extent and maintain the stability of the structure.

3.1.2 Na4MnCr(PO4)3. 
Na4MnCr(PO4)3(NMCP) is another promising cathode material for Na-ion batteries. Like Na3MnTi(PO4)3, it also has three redox pairs: Mn2+/3+ (3.5 V vs. Na+/Na), Mn3+/4+ (4.0 V vs. Na+/Na), and Cr3+/4+ (4.35 V vs. Na+/Na). The feasibility of synthesizing Na4MnCr(PO4)3 was evaluated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and compared with NaxMnM(PO4)3 (M = Ti and Zr) with the same NASICON structure(Fig. 7a).53 Among the three materials, the theoretical specific capacity of NMCP is the largest, reaching 165 mA h g−1. They also investigated the electrochemical performance of NMCP at different temperatures. It can be found from Fig. 7b that in the voltage region around 3.6 V, the capacity of the battery gradually increases with the increase in temperature, while the trend in the voltage region around 4.2 V is completely the opposite. And on the whole, the performance difference of the battery at various temperatures is not very large, which also provides a possibility for us to prepare batteries that work under extreme conditions. Zhao et al. synthesized Na4MnCr(PO4)3 with excellent electrochemical performance(165 mA h g−1 at 30 mA g−1, 73.3% capacity retention after 500 cycles within the potential region of 2.5–4.6 V).52 They believed that the evolution of the cathode electrolyte interphase was one of the important reasons for its excellent performance. Therefore, the composition of the CEI was further studied by TOF-SIMS analysis. Each component of the CEI exhibits a three-layer structure with obvious spatial distribution (Fig. 7d). Combined with Fig. 7c, it can be seen that C2HO− corresponding to organic carbonate rocks is mainly concentrated in the outer layer, NaF2− and NaC2− constitute the middle layer of the CEI, a large amount of CrO− and MnO− exist in the inner layer of the CEI and accompanied by C10− penetrates the inner layer of the CEI. That is to say, during the charging and discharging process, CrO− and MnO− still exist in the electrode body without migrating to the surface, and the structure of NMCP is not seriously damaged, which also confirms the excellent stability of the NASICON structure. Through Rietveld refinement in NPD mode, Zhang et al. calculated that the lattice of NMCP is larger than that of Na3V2(PO4)3, which means that NMCP has sufficient Na+ diffusion channels.54 No additional characteristic peaks of long-range order between Mn and Cr were observed in the diffractogram (Fig. 7e), suggesting that Mn and Cr ions are randomly distributed in the NMCP lattice. NMCP nanoparticles with an average size of 100–200 nm were uniformly embedded in the carbon matrix, and a carbon layer with a thickness of about 6 nm uniformly covered the nanoparticles (Fig. 7f and g). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis found that Na, Mn, Cr, P, O and C elements were uniformly distributed within the particles as shown in Fig. 7h. The material exhibits very good electrochemical performance (160.5 mA h g−1 at 0.05C).

In order to deeply understand the reasons for the excellent rate performance and excellent Na storage behavior of the Na4MnCr(PO4)3 electrode, Zhang et al. used the DFT calculation method to study the intrinsic Na+ ion diffusion energy barrier of the Na4MnCr(PO4)3 electrode.68 As shown in Fig. 8a–d, four possible migration pathways are rationally built following Na(1)–Na(1), Na(2)–Na(2), Na(1)–Na(2)–Na(1), and Na(2)–Na(1)–Na(2). The diffusion barriers for the four paths are 5.6 eV, 2.46 eV, 0.2 eV, and 0.37 eV, respectively. Hence, the Na(1)–Na(2)–Na(1) and Na(2)–Na(1)–Na(2) paths are favorable for the diffusion of sodium ions in the Na4MnCr(PO4)3 structure. NMCP has a low energy barrier for ion diffusion and good electrical conductivity with good reaction kinetics and excellent rate performance. Overall, the introduction of the Cr3+/4+ redox pair can not only improve the discharge capacity, operating voltage, and energy density but also effectively suppress the Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn3+ at room temperature, ensuring the stability of the NASICON structure during cycling.

It is worth noting that trace amounts of Cr3+ are beneficial elements for the human body; however, when oxidized to Cr6+, it is toxic and poses a great danger to the environment and humans.69,70 Therefore, from the perspective of green environmental protection, the addition of the Cr element is not an optimal solution. Of course, this also gives us a new challenge, and we believe that the synthesis of environmentally friendly NASICON will be a hot topic in the future.


3.1.3 Na3MnZr(PO4)3. 
Recent studies have shown that Na3MnZr(PO4)3 (NMZP) possesses promising electrochemical performance as a cathode material for Na-ion batteries. Unlike NMTP and NMCP, NMZP has only two redox pairs: Mn4+/Mn3+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ when used as a cathode material for Na-ion batteries.48,49 The crystal structure of Na3MnZr(PO4)3 consists of MnO6 and ZrO6 octahedral units bridged with corner-sharing PO4 tetrahedral units to form a framework structure with interstitial sites (Fig. 9a). Like other manganese-based materials, there are two pairs of redox peaks in the CV curve: Mn3+/Mn2+ (3.6 V/3.5 V) and Mn4+/Mn3+ (4.1 V/4.0 V), the corresponding electrochemical reaction process is as follows: Na3MnZr(PO4)3 ↔ Na2MnZr(PO4)3 + Na+ + e−(1) Na2MnZr(PO4)3 ↔ NaMnZr(PO4)3 + Na+ + e−(2)

In the lowest-energy Na2MnZr(PO4)3 structure, the MnO6 center has two distinct localized environments (Mn1 and Mn2) (Fig. 9b and c). It is not difficult to find that in both environments, the Mn–O1 bond is longer than the Mn–O2 bond. Comparing the bond distributions of the two Mn sites, Gao et al. found that the orientation of the local Jahn–Teller twist is subtly related to the order of the local Na(2), where preference is maximized for the Jahn–Teller effect that shares oxygen with the Na(2) site.49 While the MnO6 site is distorted on a local scale, the Na(2) site lacks long-range order, suggesting that in other materials the cooperative Jahn–Teller distortion of the Mn3+ center would be suppressed, which is beneficial for long-term cycling stability. Some polyanionic cathode materials can have great temperature suitability and high energy density. Ma et al. synthesized Na3MnZr(PO4)3 microspheres, composed of an interconnected conductive network with reduced graphene and oxide amorphous carbon, by spray drying(Fig. 9d).48 The interconnected two-carbon network provides a fast electron transport pathway, buffers the volume change and avoids the formation of cracks in the NMZP@C-rGO microspheres. Fig. 9e shows that the material has good rate capability in a wide temperature range, which also provides an effective way to develop a cathode material with good temperature adaptability for sodium-ion batteries.


3.1.4 Mixed polyanion manganese-based NASICON. 
The polyanionic structural((XO4)3n−) units are tightly connected by very strong covalent bonds, which can support the crystal structure of stable materials with excellent chemical, thermal and electrochemical stability. In addition, the higher electronegativity of X ions weakens the covalent properties of M−O bonds through the M-O-X induction effect, resulting in NASICON materials with higher redox potentials.20,25 Moreover, a wider variety of polyanions can be formed and the redox potential of the material is easily adjustable. Therefore, in addition to the substitution of transition metal positions, the substitution of anionic positions is also a viable method to improve performance.
Mixed polyanion manganese-based NASICON is another class of cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.71–73 Kim et al. reported a pyrophosphate-substituted mixed polyanionic manganese-based material Na4Mn3(PO4)2(P2O7).56 Through first-principles calculations and experiments, it was found that the Na+ migration rate of this material increases with the enhancement of the Jahn–Teller distortion. This anomalous characteristic enables it to provide batteries with excellent cycling stability and rate performance. Tang et al. synthesized a new mixed polyanion material Na4Mn2Co(PO4)2(P2O7) composited with carbon nanotubes by the spray-drying method.74 With the excellent framework of carbon nanotubes, the material exhibits a reversible initial discharge capacity of 96.1 mA h g−1 and a high operating voltage of 3.86 V. In conclusion, the emergence of mixed polyanionic NASICON materials provides a way for us to prepare high-performance, low-cost, and pollution-free sodium-ion batteries.

3.2 Fex+/Fey+ redox-couple based materials

3.2.1 Na3Fe2(PO4)3. 
Similar to manganese-based materials, iron-based materials also have two redox pairs: Fe3+/Fe2+ and Fe4+/Fe3+.20,75 Unlike manganese-based materials, most iron-based materials only use the redox pair of Fe3+/Fe2+, and the working voltage is also a little lower(∼2.5 V vs. Na+/Na). Among many iron-based NASICON materials, Na3Fe2(PO4)3 (NFP) is the most common one. Like the typical NASICON structure, Na3Fe2(PO4)3 consists of PO4 tetrahedra and FeO6 octahedra forming a framework structure with open channels(Fig. 10a).76 Computational modeling techniques were used to investigate the defect chemistry, sodium-ion diffusion paths, and doping properties in Na3Fe2(PO4)3 cathode materials. Fig. 10b shows the defect of Na3Fe2(PO4)3, and the lowest energy defect process is Na-Frenkel, which indicates that Na vacancies will contribute to the diffusion of Na+ in this material. It is also pointed out that doping Zr at the Fe site and doping Si at the P site can promote the formation of Na vacancies and Na interstitials in the material. This provides theoretical guidance for our preparation of new NASICON cathode materials. Liu et al. used ex situ XRD measurements(Fig. 10d) to understand the structural changes of Na3Fe2(PO4)3 during charging and discharging.77 During the discharge process, with the insertion of sodium ions, a new diffraction peak appeared at around 40.5°, indicating that a two-phase reaction occurred. Na3Fe2(PO4)3 is gradually transformed into Na4Fe2(PO4)3 or Na5Fe2(PO4)3. Fig. 10c shows the porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 material prepared using the sol–gel method.78 The abundant pore structure increases the specific surface area, which makes the sample fully come into contact with the electrolyte, accelerates the migration rate of Na+, and improves the intercalation/deintercalation kinetics of Na+. After that, they also modified it by doping K at the Na site. From the CV curve (Fig. 10e), it can be seen that in addition to the redox peak pair of 2.47 V/2.65 V (Fe3+/Fe2+), there are two pairs of redox peaks at 2.09 V/2.21 V and 1.83 V/1.93 V. This is due to K+ intercalation/delamination, which means that K doping can significantly improve the electrochemical performance of NFP. At the same time, the ionic radius of K is larger than that of Na, and K doping can increase the lattice distance and inhibit the structural damage from Na3Fe2(PO4)3 to Na5Fe2(PO4)3.79 Moreover, Rajagopalan et al. reported for the first time the application of the Fe3+/Fe4+ redox couple in sodium-ion batteries.75 The redox pairs indicated by arrows in the CV curve (Fig. 10f) represent Fe3+/Fe4+. Its discharge specific capacity is ∼109 mA h g−1, and the capacity retention rate is >96% after 200 cycles. CV, XPS and XANES analyses revealed the formation of Fe4+ oxidation states and confirmed the reversibility of the Fe3+/Fe4+ redox couple. This provides a new solution for developing stable Fe3+/Fe4+ redox couple-based SIB cathode materials.

3.2.2 Mixed polyanion iron-based NASICON. 
Similar to manganese-based materials, there are also many mixed polyanion NASICON materials for iron-based materials.71,72 Wu et al. reported a novel NASICON material, NaFe2PO4(MoO4)2 (Fig. 11a).80 The incorporation of a large number of MoO4 groups makes the crystal gap larger, which shortens the Na+ migration path and accelerates its migration rate. Under the action of Fe2+/Fe3+, NaFe2PO4(MoO4)2 can provide a reversible specific capacity of 80 mA h g−1 at 0.1C. Konda Shiva et al. reported a low-temperature synthesis of NaFe2PO4(SO4)2 with a capacity close to 100 mA h g−1 and a coulombic efficiency close to 100% at 0.1C in the voltage range of 2 V–4 V.81 Subsequently, NaFe2(PO4)(SO4)2 was prepared as a pure phase for the first time.82 During discharge at a rate of C/20, the compound has a capacity of 89 mA h g−1. The relatively low electrical conductivity and sodium ion diffusion rate of this material are important reasons for limiting its electrochemical performance. Through first-principles calculations and experiments, Kim et al. found that the sodium removal of the NaxFe3(PO4)2(P2O7) electrode occurs through a single-phase reaction with a reversible Fe2+/Fe3+ redox reaction, accompanied by very small volume changes.83 It is unusual for such a small volume change to occur and it is attributed to the open framework of polyanionic compounds with P2O7 dimers that can twist and rotate to accommodate structural changes. Moreover, Chen et al. used BVS and DFT calculations to study the local transfer energy barrier of Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7).84 This material has three different types of Na+ as shown in Fig. 11b, and constitutes four Na+ diffusion paths (Fig. 11c). We can find that the energy barriers of these four Na+ diffusion paths are all very low, less than 0.9 eV, which makes it have a good Na+ migration rate. In addition, the material is also compounded with graphene85 and multi-walled carbon nanotubes,86 and shows excellent electrochemical properties. From the above, because the cost of iron resources is quite low (Fig. 2b), iron-based NASICON materials have the potential to become a strong contender in the cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries applied in future large-scale energy storage systems.

3.3 Other vanadium-free NASICON cathodes
In addition to the common manganese-based materials and iron-based materials, there are other types of vanadium-free NASICON used in sodium-ion battery cathode materials such as Na3Cr2(PO4)3,87 Na4Co3(PO4)2P2O7,88–91 and Na4Ni3(PO4)2P2O7.92,93
Na3Cr2(PO4)3 has a high-voltage operation based on the Cr4+/Cr3+(4.5 V vs. Na/Na+) redox pair, which is the key to improving the energy density of rechargeable batteries. Kawai et al. studied the application of the Cr4+/Cr3+ redox couple in the framework of polyanions in the cathode of high-voltage (Fig. 12a) sodium batteries.87 Although the material obtained a good initial discharge specific capacity of 98 mA h g−1 at 0.5C, the material's cycle stability was not good enough; after several cycles of charge and discharge, the capacity decayed rapidly (Fig. 12b). Moreover, excessive oxidation or spontaneous disproportionation can produce highly toxic Cr6+, which also limits its large-scale application. Na4Co3(PO4)2P2O7 (Fig. 12d) is a cathode material with a high working voltage, which was successfully applied in Na-ion batteries as early as 2013.89 It had multiple redox reactions within a voltage window of 4.1 V to 4.7 V and could provide a reversible capacity of about 95 mA h g−1 (Fig. 12e). Moriwake et al. studied the structural changes of Na4Co3(PO4)2P2O7 during charging and discharging by using theoretical calculations.88 When Na4Co3(PO4)2P2O7 is de-sodiumized to NaCo3(PO4)2P2O7, all Co2+ ions are oxidized to Co3+ ions. Continued de-sodiumization to obtain Co3(PO4)2P2O7 requires oxidizing the oxygen 2p orbitals in the P2O7 polyhedron, rather than oxidizing Co3+ to Co4+. The resulting pores are expected to be strongly self-trapped, rendering them immobile at room temperature. Simultaneously, during the final step of de-sodiumization, a large volume contraction was observed, which constricted the sodium migration channel. This also means that it is very difficult to completely de-sodiumize Na4Co3(PO4)2P2O7. P. Ramesh Kumar et al. reported Na4Ni3(PO4)2P2O7 with the highest Ni2+/Ni3+ redox potential of 4.8 V.92 The Na4Ni3(PO4)2P2O7 electrode exhibits a stable discharge capacity of 51 mA h g−1 (Fig. 12c) for 40 cycles at a rate of 0.1C, corresponding to 1.3 reversible intercalation/deintercalation of Na+. In addition to the removal of 1.3 Na+, structural deformation was also observed during charge–discharge, which was confirmed by in situ PXRD measurements. Furthermore, B. Senthilkumar et al. successfully synthesized a novel cathode material Na4Ni3(PO4)2P2O7 by the facile solution combustion synthesis technique.93 Due to the reversible redox reaction of Ni2+/Ni3+ and the effect of carbon coating, the material exhibits a high capacitance of 1094 F g−1 in 2 M NaOH aqueous solution. This provides guidance for improving the performance of high-voltage Na4Ni3(PO4)2P2O7 materials for next-generation sodium-ion batteries. Finally, the electrochemical performance of vanadium-free NASICON as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries is summarized (Table 1).

4. Anode materials
The ionic radius of sodium ions is larger than that of lithium ions, making it difficult to find a suitable anode material for sodium-ion batteries. Currently, there are some main types of anode materials for sodium-ion batteries: carbon-based materials,113,114 titanium-based materials,115,116 organic materials,117,118 alloy materials,119,120 and conversion/conversion-alloying materials.121,122 Specifically, alloy materials and conversion/conversion-alloying materials have an ultra-high specific capacity of 200–2000 mA h g−1.123 However, these materials also have major disadvantages, namely, poor reaction kinetics, and huge volume changes before and after sodium intercalation and de-intercalation (about 400% for phosphide, about 150–250% for oxide), which lead to pulverization of the material during cycling.37 After the electrical contact in the materials, and between the materials and the current collector is lost, the specific capacity decays rapidly, making practical applications difficult. The NASICON-type material has a stable structural framework, high ionic conductivity, and good thermal stability. Therefore, it exhibits excellent long-term cycle stability and a high capacity retention rate during cycling, which is suitable for sodium-ion batteries. There is also considerable competitiveness in anode materials. And under continuous research in the future, it is also expected that NASICON materials with high specific capacity and high stability will be developed.
4.1 Tix+/Tiy+ redox-couple based materials

4.1.1 NaTi2(PO4)3. 
Sodium titanium phosphate (NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP)) is used as a common titanium-based SIB anode.24,37 The material also has two redox pairs: Ti2+/3+ (∼0.5 V vs. Na+/Na) and Ti3+/4+ (∼2.1 V vs. Na+/Na). Like other NASICON compounds, the crystal structure of the compound consists of corner-sharing tetrahedral PO4 and octahedral TiO6 (Fig. 13a), in which Na atoms are located in the tunnel, presenting an excellent 3D open crystal structure, leading to superior ion mobility. The Na storage mechanism in NTP is a Na+ based insertion/extraction process.124,125: NaTi2(PO4)3 + 2Na+ + 2e− ↔ Na3Ti2(PO4)3 (at ∼2.1V)(3) Na3Ti2(PO4)3 + Na+ + e− ↔ Na4Ti2(PO4)3 (at ∼0.5V)(4)

NaTi2(PO4)3, as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries has good potential and stable structure, and its three-dimensional porous framework structure enables high Na+ diffusivity. However, the low electronic conductivity also severely limits the practical application of NTP in SIB application. Pang et al. synthesized mesoporous NaTi2(PO4)3/CMK-3 material by the solvothermal method;126 as shown in Fig. 13b, many NTP particles with sizes ranging from a few nanometers to tens of nanometers were uniformly distributed inside and outside the CMK-3 mesoporous channel. CMK-3 acts as a rigid carrier for the NTP nanoparticles, preventing agglomeration and growth of the NTP nanocrystals during calcination and continuous cycling. Fang et al. used the spray drying method to composite NTP and reduced graphene oxide together to form microspheres with a particle size of about 2 ∼ 8 μm (Fig. 13c).125 An extensive three-dimensional conductive network is formed by tightly covering the surface of the microspheres with graphene sheets. The synthesized NTP@rGO composite exhibited high reversible specific capacity (130 mA h g−1 at 0.1C) and excellent long-term cycling stability (77% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 20C) within the voltage window of 1.4 V to 3 V. Besides, Wei et al. successfully synthesized porous NTP/C nanofibers by electrospinning.127 As shown in Fig. 13d, the nanofibers are porous nanostructures, and the NTP particles are uniformly dispersed on the nanofibers, and the nanofibers are intertwined with each other like wool in a sweater. They fabricated sodium-ion full cells with NiHCF as the cathode and NTP/C-NFs as the anode. From the rate performance graph(Fig. 13e), it can be found that even if the current density is as high as 1000 mA g−1, the capacity is still close to 84.8 mA h g−1, and the whole battery has excellent reversibility. The transport paths of electrons and Na+ in NTP electrodes are random and irregular, resulting in a decrease in conductivity. After being combined with different carbon materials (Fig. 13f takes carbon nanotubes as an example128), electrons can migrate with the carbon materials. At the same time, the carbon materials with different morphologies increase the specific surface area, which can increase the contact area between the material and the electrolyte, and greatly improve the migration rate of Na+. This has a positive effect on improving the electrochemical performance of the material.

Due to the structural stability and suitable potential range of NTP, it also has a wide range of applications in aqueous sodium-ion batteries.124,129 Aqueous ion batteries are one of the ideal systems that can meet the requirements of large-scale energy storage because they use a neutral salt water solution as the electrolyte, avoiding the flammability problems of organic electrolytes and overcoming the disadvantages of traditional aqueous batteries such as high pollution, short life (e.g. lead-acid batteries) and expensiveness (e.g. nickel-metal hydride batteries).130 Therefore, in recent years, the research and development of aqueous ion batteries has attracted more and more attention. Park et al. reported for the first time the application of NaTi2(PO4)3 in aqueous batteries.131 They compared the electrochemical performance of NTPs using different electrolytes (Fig. 14a and b). Obviously, the cycle performance and rate capability of the aqueous electrolyte system are better than those of the organic electrolyte system. Zhang et al. prepared a novel aqueous rechargeable sodium-ion battery with NaTi2(PO4)3 as the anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 as the cathode and explored the different electrical properties of aqueous full batteries by adjusting the mass ratio of the cathode to the anode.132 As shown in Fig. 14c, when the anode is in excess (named cathode limited), the NTP anode partially participates in the reaction, and no hydrogen evolution reaction occurs. In contrast, when the cathode is in excess (anode limited), the NVP cathode part participates in the reaction, but the hydrogen evolution reaction occurs at the anode end this time. Obviously, when the anode is in excess, the whole cell exhibits superior rate performance and high power density, which has important guiding significance for the development of novel aqueous full cells. Benefiting from the multiple pairs of redox couples in Na3MnTi(PO4)3, Gao et al. prepared an aqueous symmetric battery(Fig. 14d).133 The redox couples of Ti4+/Ti3+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ acted on the anode and cathode sides, respectively. Cathodes and anodes with the same active material can simplify the manufacturing process, reduce manufacturing costs, and buffer electrode volume changes (cathode shrinkage is accompanied by anode expansion and vice versa). The emergence of aqueous symmetric sodium-ion batteries provides a solution for large-scale stationary energy storage.

4.1.3 Metal-ion doping of NTP. 
Ti is very expensive. In order to reduce the cost of batteries, researchers usually dope the transition metal sites of NTP. Wang et al. synthesized a new NASICON material Na2CrTi(PO4)3 by incorporating Cr.134 As shown in Fig. 15a, the redox pairs of 1.98 V/2.27 V and 0.32 V/0.47 V correspond to Ti4+/Ti3+ and Ti3+/Ti2+ respectively, and 1.44 V/1.67 V corresponds to the redox pair of Cr3+/Cr2+. Under the action of multiple pairs of electrons, the material exhibits a reversible capacity of over 220 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and a specific capacity of 110 mA h g−1 at 20C, demonstrating excellent electrochemical performance. Moreover, Na3MgTi(PO4)3135 and Na2Ti3/2Mn1/2(PO4)3,136 were both used as cathode materials for aqueous sodium-ion batteries with good performance. In addition to doping at transition metal sites, researchers also studied the substitution of the Na sites. Zhan et al. reported a new NASICON structure Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3(MTP).137Fig. 15b shows that two small peaks are observed at around 0.08 V/0.1 V, which may be due to Na+ insertion/extraction in the super P conductive additive. The initial discharge specific capacity of MTP@rGO is 201.7 mA h g−1 only under the action of the Ti3+/Ti2+ redox pair. This holds great promise for high-performance anodes in sodium-ion battery applications. Besides, Zheng et al. reported KTi2(PO4)3(KTP), a material that can be used in lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries.138 The morphologies of pure KTP and KTi2(PO4)3/NC are shown in Fig. 15c and d with a regular cube shape and smooth surface. After compounding the NTCDA-derived carbon layer, the particle size became smaller and the surface was rougher. Fig. 15e shows the long-term cycling performance of the two samples at 2.6C, which indicates that the performance of KTP is greatly improved under the protection of the carbon layer. In conclusion, using atomic substitution at the transition metal sites or the Na sites, the performance of the material has been significantly improved, which provides a good idea for the design of NASICON anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.

4.2 Other vanadium-free NASICON anodes
Compared with cathode materials, vanadium-free NASICON is less used in anode materials. Meanwhile, except for the above titanium-based compounds, other types of vanadium-free NASICON anodes have been studied even less. The reason for this is that among the variable–valence transition metal elements, Ti has a low redox potential and is suitable as the anode material for sodium-ion batteries. And the tetravalent Ti element can be stable in air and exhibit different sodium storage potentials in different crystal structures.
Wang et al. used solid phase synthesis to prepare a NASICON anode (NaZr2(PO4)3(SZP)) for SIBs, which exhibited good reversible charge/discharge capacity at different C-rates.139 In SZP, the open and strongly bonded crystal structure can lead to superior mobility of the Na+ tunneling across the PO4–ZrO6 polyhedral chain. The formation energy of Na+ in protocells was estimated using the first-principles theory. The formation energy decreases to a more negative value with increasing Na+ addition. And, the stability of the lattice Na+ in the crystals increases with the decrease in the formation energy. Therefore, it can be estimated that more Na + can be inserted into the SZP lattice. At the same time, with the increase in the number of Na+ in the molecule (from 1.0 to 3.0), the unit cell volume increased by only 10%, showing excellent structural stability. Moreover, Qiu et al. applied Na3Fe2(PO4)3 as an anode material in aqueous sodium-ion batteries, which was introduced in the cathode material above.140 Due to the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple, there is reversible Na+ insertion in Na3Fe2(PO4)3, and the capacity reaches ∼60 mA h g−1 for 1000 cycles at a rate of 10C. After 1000 cycles, the anode exhibits a capacity retention of 61% at 100C. In short, with the development of science and technology, more and more vanadium-free NASICON materials are expected to be developed and applied to anodes of sodium-ion batteries. Finally, the electrochemical performance of vanadium-free NASICON as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries is summarized (Table 2).

5. Conclusions and perspectives
In this review, we report the recent progress of the vanadium-free NASICON as an electrode material for Na-ion batteries in recent years. Fig. 16 provides a comparative analysis of the electrochemical performance of some common vanadium-free NASICON materials for sodium-ion batteries. The structural features of vanadium-free NASICON materials and the impact of the sodium storage mechanism on batteries are discussed. And, the vanadium-free NASICON materials as SIB anodes and cathodes are summarized in detail, and the methods to improve the electrochemical performance are introduced.
 Fig. 16  Voltage and the specific capacity of several vanadium-free NASICON electrode materials. The anode materials are in the blue shaded area, and the other region represents cathodes. 
However, the materials currently being studied have certain drawbacks. For example, if a vanadium-free NASICON structure material is used as a cathode, its high operating voltage is a favorable property, but if used as an anode, the same property reduces energy density, limiting practical applications. Furthermore, despite the high ionic conductivity of vanadium-free NASICON structural materials, their electronic conductivity is low, which greatly affects the overall performance of the battery system. Most importantly, long-term cycle stability also needs to be further improved. In vanadium-free NASICON structured materials, common effective strategies to alleviate this problem are doping or mixing of transition metal sites, carbon composites, morphology regulation and non-stoichiometric synthesis. Besides, doping alkali K on the Na site and the composition of dual XO4 in the NASICON (AxMM′(XO4)3) like the pyrophosphate-substitution have been confirmed as valid innovative ways to improve the properties of the electrodes. Furthermore, new NASICON-type materials are expected to be explored further and developed by researchers. Meanwhile, since uniform morphology is a key factor for achieving stable and excellent electrochemical performance in battery systems, the control method for material synthesis has been a challenge for vanadium-free NASICON structural materials. Therefore, to achieve ideal electrochemical performance, not only good preparation techniques but feasibility in practical applications also need to be considered.
In conclusion, the search for NASICON without vanadium, chromium and other toxic elements as an environmentally friendly and low-cost electrode material shows great promise. However, there are still many challenges to be solved to achieve a wide range of practical applications. The development of energy in the future must be green, sustainable, safe and clean, and we believe that continued research efforts addressing these challenges will open up a new frontier for next-generation rechargeable batteries.
