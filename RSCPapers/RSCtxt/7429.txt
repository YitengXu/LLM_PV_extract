    , Accepted 9th May 2013First published on 10th May 2013AbstractTransition metal nitrides of group 4–6 (Mo2N, W2N, NbN, Ta3N5, and TiN) were synthesized by the urea-glass route and screened for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrodes in PEMFCs. In terms of electrochemical stability and activity, TiN was selected as the most promising candidate as a catalyst for ORR. To further enhance the activity for ORR, TiN was modified with nanostructured carbon supports including CNTs, graphene (GR), and CNT–GR hybrid. The obtained nanocarbon-supported TiN catalysts exhibited small particle sizes of TiN (<7 nm) and a good TiN–support interaction with reduced aggregation and no free-standing TiN particles away from the supports compared to bare TiN. In particular, TiN supported on the CNT–GR hybrid (TiN/CNT–GR) showed greatly enhanced ORR activity than bare TiN and other supported TiN catalysts. It exhibited a high onset potential (0.83 V) and the highest current density among the reported nitride-based electrocatalysts. The enhancement was ascribed to a synergistic effect between TiN nanoparticles (NPs) and CNT–GR hybird support, roles of which were to provide active sites for ORR and a facile electron pathway to NPs, respectively. Besides, TiN/CNT–GR exhibited large mesopores that could allow easy access of the electrolyte due to the formation of a 3-D CNT–GR structure assembled between 2-D graphene and 1-D CNTs. Further, it showed an excellent methanol tolerance compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Thus, our TiN/CNT–GR could be a promising ORR electrocatalyst for PEMFCs and DMFCs.
Introduction
Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are attracting great attention as a promising power source for transportation and residential applications due to their high energy conversion efficiency, noise-free, pollutant-free operation, and long-lasting systems due to a lack of moving parts.1 However, the high price of Pt, the most effective electrocatalyst for both anode and cathode, restricts wide-spread dissemination of PEMFCs. In particular, sluggish and corrosive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in cathodes of PEMFCs requires a large amount of Pt and causes durability problems.2 Thus, development of noble metal-free and stable alternative materials for ORR is of great importance to make PEMFCs commercially viable. So far, many noble metal-free catalyst candidates have been reported for ORR, including macrocycles,3 chalcogenides,4 metal oxides,5 carbides,6 nitrides,7 and nitrogen-doped carbons.8 Unfortunately, these materials do not satisfy the activity and stability requirements at the same time. Here, we investigate the electrochemical properties of pure transition metal nitrides (TMNs) of group 4–6 metals as a new class of ORR catalysts. Among the tested TMNs, the TiN catalyst exhibited the most promising performance in activity and stability, and it was modified with nanocarbon supports of CNTs, graphene (GR), and CNT–GR hybrid. The obtained catalyst, i.e. TiN nanoparticles (NPs) on a CNT–GR hybrid support (TiN/CNT–GR), represents a low cost, noble metal-free ORR catalyst exhibiting a high onset potential of 0.83 V comparable to Pd-based catalysts9–11 and the best ORR current density among the reported nitride-based materials.7,12–15
TMNs have unique physical properties, such as hardness, wear resistance, and superconductivity, responsible for their various applications like coating agents for cutting tools and refractory materials. They also have been considered as a possible replacement for Pt-group metal catalysts in various heterogeneous catalyses, including isomerization, hydrodesulfurization, and hydrogenation reactions16 due to their similar electronic structures to those of noble metals.17 Recently, many nitride materials have received considerable attention in energy applications including fuel cells,12,18 photocatalysts,19,20 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),21,22 and hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs).23 Particularly in fuel cell applications, many nitride-based materials, oxynitrides,24 carbonitrides,25 and partially oxidized carbonitrides (CNO)13 have been reported as potential ORR catalysts, pioneered by Ota and coworkers. Their Zr, Nb, and Ta-based CNO catalysts showed very high onset potentials above 0.85 V with high stability in acid media. However, due to their high synthetic temperature (>1500 °C), these catalysts did not provide high surface area, small particle size, or high density of active sites, resulting in low current densities. To increase the activity of nitrides for ORR, TiN NPs were loaded on carbon black (CB) using a mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4) template by Domen et al.12 Here, mpg-C3N4 acts as a nitrogen source as well as a template for growth of TiN NPs. Due to the aid of the template, uniform-sized TiN NPs were synthesized on CB and the resultant TiN/CB exhibited better activity for ORR than bare TiN NPs, and high onset potential (0.8 V). However, various steps in their synthetic method (mpg-C3N4 synthesis on CB, silica removal, Ti precursor impregnation, and heat treatment) require long time and tedious efforts. Thus, to use nitride materials as ORR catalysts, general electrochemical information about the activity and stability of pure TMNs is necessary for proper selection of candidate materials, and a simple but effective synthetic method is also needed to enhance their performance.
In the present work, to broaden the scope of TMNs as electrocatalysts for ORR, electrochemical screening of group 4–6 TMNs for ORR was carried out. The simple synthetic method of urea-glass route26,27 was employed to fabricate the TMNs. Next, to provide a highly conductive electron pathway and large surface area, nanostructured carbons (CNTs, GR, and CNT–GR) were introduced to form TMN–carbon composites by the modified urea-glass route proposed here. The resultant TiN/CNT–GR exhibited small TiN particle sizes of less than 7 nm and a good metal–support interaction featuring less aggregation and no free-standing TiN particles away from the support. Furthermore, it showed increased large mesopores that allowed easy access of the electrolyte to active TiN sites due to the formation of a 3-D-like structure between CNTs and GR. Thus, our TiN/CNT–GR exhibited high activity and stability for ORR in acid media with a high onset potential and an enhanced current density due to a synergetic effect between TiN NPs and CNT–GR hybrid support. In addition, it also showed a strong methanol tolerance for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). We have demonstrated a useful general strategy to develop an efficient, Pt-free electrocatalyst for ORR, i.e. search of an active and stable phase for ORR (TiN in our case) and its modification by using the CNT–GR hybrid support to provide a highly conductive electron pathway and large mesopores for facile access of the electrolyte to the active phase.
Experimental
Synthesis of TMNs by the urea-glass route
Metal chlorides (MoCl5, WCl4, NbCl5, TaCl5, and TiCl4) were used as metal precursors for synthesis of TMNs. In a typical synthesis, 1 g of metal chloride was dispersed in 2.53 ml of ethanol, and an appropriate amount of urea, as a nitrogen source, was added to the solution. The molar ratios of urea to metal precursors were 1–9. After 1 h stirring, the viscous metal–urea complex formed was transferred to a tubular furnace and calcined at 750 °C for 3 h under a N2 atmosphere. More detailed descriptions for the synthesis of TMNs including the exact amount of reagents and post-treatment conditions (for NbN as an example) were given in the ESI.†
Synthesis of TiN NPs supported on GR, CNTs, and CNT–GR by the modified urea-glass route
Nanocarbon-supported TiN catalysts were synthesized by a simple modification of the urea-glass route named the modified urea-glass route. Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized by Hummer's method,28 and CNTs were purchased from Hanwha Nanotech (CMP-310F). GO, CNTs, and a mixture of GO and CNTs with a 1:1 weight ratio were used as starting materials for supports. The amount of Ti metal was fixed to 60 wt% in supported TiN catalysts. Thus, 2.53 ml of ethanol solution containing 1 g of TiCl4 was dispersed ultrasonically in 15 ml ethanol solution containing 95 mg of each support (GO, CNTs, and CNT–GO). After vigorous stirring for 1 h with 1583 mg of urea, the resulting solution was dried in a 100 °C oven to evaporate the excess amount of ethanol. After heat treatment under the same conditions as for TiN synthesis, supported TiN nanoparticles were obtained.
Catalysts' characterization
The crystalline structure of synthesized catalysts was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a PANalytical pw 3040/60 X'pert diffractometer, and structural information was elucidated with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-7410F) and a high resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F). Surface areas and pore structures of the catalysts were obtained from N2 sorption isotherms measured at 77 K on a constant volume adsorption apparatus (Nanoporosity-XQ, Mirae Scientific Instruments, Korea). X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) was applied to investigate the local structure of TiN NPs, from data collected on 7D beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PLS-II, 3.0 GeV), Korea. The incident beam was monochromatized using a Si (111) double crystal monochromator. At room temperature, the spectra were taken for the K-edge of Ti (E0 = 4966 eV) in a transmission mode with He-filled and N2-filled IC Spec ionization chambers for incident and transmitted beams, respectively. The obtained data were analyzed with ATHENA and ARTEMIS in the IFEFIT suite of software programs.29 The reference material used as a standard for fitting experimentally derived Radial structural functions (RSF) was generated with Feff 8.2 code30 by using a known TiN crystal structure.31
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were carried out in a conventional three electrode cell with N2 or O2 saturated aqueous solution of 0.5 M H2SO4 using an Ivium potentiostat (Ivium technologies). The Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) electrode and a Pt plate were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. In this paper, all the potentials were referred to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) without specification. For electrochemical screening tests of TMNs, working electrodes were prepared by dispersing 20 mg of catalyst in 2 ml of deionized water and 40 μl of 5% Nafion solution and pipetting out 5 μl of slurry onto a glassy carbon electrode (0.0707 cm2). 3 μl of Nafion solution was added on top to fix the electrocatalyst. The CV tests were performed in a range of 0 V–1.2 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The LSV measurements of TMNs were carried out at the potential range of 1.1 V to 0.2 V with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The ORR on the TiN-based catalysts was studied using a rotating disk electrode (RDE, PAR Model 636 RDE system). Fabrication of catalyst slurry with TiN-based catalysts is the same as that of TMNs. 15 μl of slurry and 9 μl of Nafion solution were transferred onto a glassy carbon electrode (0.19635 cm2) to prepare a working electrode. During CV and LSV measurements, the working electrode was rotated at 1600 rpm with the same applied potentials and scan rates for TMNs. In the identical cell setup, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out. The frequency range was from 100 kHz to 1 mHz with a modulation amplitude of 10 mV at 0.6 V bias voltage. The EIS spectra were fitted by the Z-view software.
Results and discussion
Screening of TMNs for ORR
For electrochemical screening for ORR, pure phases of TMNs were fabricated by a simple synthetic method of urea-glass route.26,27 Thus, nitrides of group 4–6 (Mo2N, W2N, NbN, Ta3N5, and TiN) were synthesized. Fig. S1a† displays the XRD patterns of synthesized TMNs. All the TMNs exhibited cubic structures except for Ta3N5, which showed a hexagonal structure. TMNs were well-matched to their reference XRD patterns of Mo2N (JCPDS no. 00-25-1366), W2N (00-025-1257), NbN (00-038-1155), Ta3N5 (01-079-1533), and TiN (00-038-1420). No peaks of impurities, including oxides or metals, were observed. Using the Scherrer equation, the average particle sizes of TMNs were estimated to be 6.8 nm, 2.1 nm, 6.4 nm, 26 nm, and 7.5 nm for Mo2N, W2N, NbN, Ta3N5, and TiN, respectively. SEM images of synthesized TMNs are presented in Fig. S1b–f.† In all cases, particles of TMNs exhibited a spherical morphology and no impurity phases were observed, which revealed the large scale homogeneity of synthesized TMNs.
Electrochemical stabilities of TMNs in an acid medium (0.5 M H2SO4) were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV). Some TMNs are known to be weak under corrosive conditions of ORR.32–34 Thus, general potentials with 20 scans were applied to sort out unstable catalysts from the synthesized TMNs. The CV results are presented in Fig. 1 with the dotted lines representing the first scan. Mo2N showed a very large oxidation current even in the first scan of CV measurements from 0.6 V, which was the corrosion current originated from the transformation of Mo2N into molybdenum oxide. Thus, Mo2N is not suitable as an ORR catalyst for PEMFCs due to its instability in the acid medium. W2N exhibited relatively better stability without the large oxidation current compared to Mo2N. However, reduction of peak intensity in the hydrogen adsorption/desorption region was observed with increasing number of scans due to dissolution of W2N in the acid medium.32 Further, there exists a small oxidation current from 0.6 V. And also, W2N is not a good catalyst for ORR considering the electrochemical instability. On the other hand, NbN, Ta3N5, and TiN showed similar good stability in CV measurements. Their currents increased with increasing number of scans and were stabilized before the 20th scan. No specific oxidation currents were observed in their CV traces. The results verified the electrochemical stability of NbN, Ta3N5, and TiN. Therefore, the electrochemical stability of TMNs can be aligned in the following order: Mo2N ≪ W2N < NbN, Ta3N5, TiN.

Fig. 2 shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results of TMNs for ORR to reveal the electrochemical activities for ORR. Dotted and solid lines exhibit the measured currents in O2– and N2–saturated sulfuric acid solutions, respectively. All the LSV tests (except for Mo2N) were performed after CV measurements to clean and stabilize the catalyst surface. In the case of Mo2N, we were not able to observe any ORR activity after CV due to the formation of inactive molybdenum oxide. Hence, fresh Mo2N catalysts without prior CV tests were used for LSV measurements. The ORR current density (JORR) could be determined by the difference of current densities between O2 and N2 saturated solutions. Mo2N exhibited a fairly large ORR current density from 0.6 V as shown in Fig. 2a. However, due to the instability in the potential range of ORR, its activity has no practical meaning. W2N did not generate a significant ORR current density in Fig. 2b. A tiny ORR current density was observed from 0.3 V, but the onset potential and the scale of ORR current density were negligibly small. Considering its activity and stability, W2N is not a suitable catalyst for ORR either. These results on Mo2N and W2N are not consistent with previous reports. Zhong et al. showed good activities and stabilities of carbon supported Mo2N and W2N.14,15 However, we suspect that a large portion of their activity and stability may have originated from nitrogen-doped carbon. For the synthesis of nitride materials, they used the typical ammonolysis method using NH3 gas. Heat treatment of carbon in NH3 gas would form nitrogen-doped carbon with Mo2N or W2N, which is known as an active catalyst for ORR. The effect of nitrogen-doped carbon on ORR will be discussed in the next section.

NbN exhibited ORR activity from 0.6 V with a current density of ∼1 μA. The onset potential of Ta3N5 was 0.5 V, which was similar to the one reported in a previous study.7 Still, its ORR current density was rather low. In the case of TiN, its onset potential for ORR was 0.6 V. However, TiN exhibited nearly 10 times higher ORR current densities compared to NbN and Ta3N5. As a result, electrochemical activities of TMNs can be aligned in the following order: W2N < NbN, Ta3N5 ≪ TiN < Mo2N. The results lead us to conclude that TiN is the most promising ORR catalyst considering the electrochemical stability as well as the activity in the potential range of ORR. Yet, its activity is still rather low compared to noble metal-based ORR catalysts including Pt or Pd-based catalysts. As an effort to improve the performance of TiN catalysts, nanocarbon supports were introduced to these TiN NPs.
TiN on a CNT–graphene hybrid support
Three nanostructured carbon materials, CNTs, GR, and CNT–GR hybrid, were used as supports for TiN NPs. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of synthesized TiN supported on various nanostructured carbons are presented in Fig. S2† with those of bare TiN for comparison. Their XRD patterns were well-matched to reference XRD patterns of TiN (JCPDS no. 38-1420) without any undesired product peaks such as titanium dioxide or titanium metal, indicating the synthesis of TiN with a pure phase. And supported TiN catalysts showed small peaks around 24–26° in Fig. S2b†, which originated from CNTs or GR.36 By the Scherrer equation, the average particle sizes of TiN NPs were estimated to be 7.5 nm, 7.0 nm, 6.8 nm, and 6.9 nm for TiN, TiN/GR, TiN/CNT, and TiN/CNT–GR, respectively. Estimated particle sizes were generally consistent with TEM results shown below. The supported TiN, in general, exhibited a little smaller particle size although the difference was marginal. Thus, the significant difference in physicochemical properties and electrochemical performances between bare and supported TiN catalysts (as discussed below) could not be attributed to particle size effects. However, synthesized TiN catalysts exhibited small particle sizes less than 7 nm with high crystallinity and high purity, which are general requirements for good catalysts or electrocatalysts. Furthermore, considering the synthesis of small particles of TiN of less than 10 nm is rare35 due to high temperatures involved in the synthesis (>750 °C), these results demonstrate the effectiveness of our modified urea-glass route method to fabricate TiN NPs on nanocarbon supports.
SEM images of synthesized catalysts are exhibited in Fig. 3 together with the schematic representation of the morphology of each sample in the inset. Spherical-shaped TiN NPs were heavily agglomerated as shown in Fig. 3a. In the case of TiN/GR in Fig. 3b, the morphology of GR was clearly found and TiN NPs were loaded on the GR sheets, which were horizontally stacked each other. The stacking of GR sheets is commonly observed for this 2-D carbon and decreases potential sites for active component loading present between GR sheets.36 Even for the active component placed between the two GR sheets, it is hard to be accessible by the electrolyte. In Fig. 3c, bundled CNTs were observed with randomly located TiN NPs. The TiN NPs generally located on the outer surface of bundled CNTs (inset of Fig. 3c), which reduces the actual surface area for TiN particles to settle down on the support. Thus, we could not utilize the high surface area of CNTs effectively.37 Furthermore, like stacked GR sheets in TiN/GR, TiN NPs somehow intruded into the CNT bundles and are not easily accessible by the electrolyte, and thus the number of TiN NPs that can join ORR decreases. However, in CNT–GR hybrid layers shown in Fig. 3d, monotubes of CNTs were located between GR monosheets. Apparently, CNTs act as a spacer to block the stacking of GR sheets. At the same time, GR sheets also block the bundling of CNTs. As shown in Fig. S4,† highly bundled and entangled CNTs were observed in the SEM image of TiN/CNT (Fig. S4a†). In contrast, in the presence of GR, the CNTs were much more disentangled compared to CNTs alone (Fig. S4b†). These observations are consistent with previous reports on the composite of graphene oxide and CNTs.38,39 Thus, our CNT–GR hybrid could alleviate the stacking of graphene and bundling of CNTs by acting as a spacer for each other.

Fig. 4 displays the TEM images to analyze the structural details of synthesized catalysts. Spherical TiN NPs with an average particle size of 7.7 nm were observed in Fig. 4a. The lattice spacings of 0.242 nm and 0.207 nm shown in the inset image of Fig. 4a are consistent with the known d values of (111) and (200) planes of TiN. However, heavy aggregation of the primary TiN NPs was observed. In the TEM images of TiN/GR in Fig. 4b, formation of GR from reduction of graphene oxide could be confirmed by a wrinkled paper-like morphology of GR sheets and an interlayer distance of 0.345 nm corresponding to the d(002) value of GR (0.34 nm).40 Thermal reduction of graphene oxide is a method to fabricate graphene from graphene oxide, and the high synthetic temperature (750 °C) is enough to reduce graphene oxide.41,42 In a stark contrast to bare TiN, the TiN NPs with an average particle size of 7.3 nm were highly dispersed over the GR sheets in TiN/GR without severe aggregation. Furthermore, there were no free-standing TiN particles which were located away from the GR sheets (Fig. 4b and Fig. S5a†).
 Fig. 4  TEM images of (a) TiN, (b) TiN/GR, (c) TiN/CNT, and (d) TiN/CNT–GR. Insets show high resolution TEM images of each sample. (See Fig. S3† for enlarged inset images.) 
Less aggregation and no free-standing particles of TiN were common observation for TiN/CNT (Fig. 4c and Fig. S5b†) and TiN/CNT–GR (Fig. 4d and Fig. S5c†). These results lead us to conclude that there exists a good TiN–support interaction,43,44 which could prevent TiN NPs from self-agglomeration and separation from the supports. The interaction could also facilitate the electron transfer from the nanocarbon supports to TiN NPs when applied as an ORR catalyst. Fig. 4c shows the TEM images of TiN/CNT with a clear multi-walled CNT (MWCNT) structure (inset image). The TiN particles, with a size of 7.1 nm, adhered well onto CNTs. In Fig. 4d, the TEM images of TiN/CNT–GR exhibit that CNTs were randomly distributed on GR sheets, and TiN particles with an average size of 7.1 nm were attached well on both CNTs and GR. By XRD and TEM analyses, we could confirm that our preparation method (the modified urea-glass route) is an effective way to synthesize hybrid materials of TiN NPs on nanocarbon supports featuring a good metal–support interaction, which has been revealed by reduced aggregation and no free-standing particles away from the nanocarbon support. We believe this preparation method proposed here can be easily applied to the synthesis of various nitride materials on nanocarbon supports for other electrochemical reactions.
The local structures around Ti in bare and supported TiN were examined with X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS). No particular changes were observed in the Ti K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) of TiN NPs including the pre-edge peak due to 1s → 3d transition (Fig. S6a†). It is due to an octahedral symmetry of Ti having one 3d electron. However, the Fourier-transformed EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure) in Fig. S6b† showed that the peak intensities for supported TiN catalysts were all similar but clearly lower than that of bare TiN catalysts. The decrease in the peak intensity indicates a lower coordination number or a larger Debye–Waller factor. Therefore, we calculated structural parameters through a nonlinear least squares fitting and the results are given in Table S2.† The Ti–Ti coordination number of bare TiN was slightly larger than those of carbon-supported catalysts, in agreement with its slightly larger particle size. In addition, the Debye–Waller factors of the supported TiN, an indicator of the structural disorder, were larger than those of bare TiN. The distances of Ti–N and Ti–Ti for supported TiN were shorter by 0.01 Å than those for bare TiN catalysts. These results suggest that carbon supports interfere with the crystallization process of TiN NPs to some degree and provide additional evidence of TiN–carbon interaction in supported TiN catalysts. But these structural differences are not large enough to account for the marked differences in electrochemical properties between bare and supported TiN NPs as discussed below.
Textural properties of synthesized catalysts were analyzed using N2 sorption isotherms. The surface area and pore size distribution (PSD) of the catalysts were determined by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) methods, respectively. TiN-based catalysts exhibited type IV isotherms as in Fig. 5a, which was characteristic of mesoporous materials.45 The BET surface area of bare TiN (156 m2 g−1) was relatively high compared to other TiN catalysts synthesized by the traditional ammonolysis method or commercial TiN NPs (<60 m2 g−1).18,46 TiN/CNT showed the highest BET surface area (300 m2 g−1) because of the high surface area of CNTs.37 However, the BET surface area of TiN/GR (168 m2 g−1) increased only slightly higher due to the stacking of GR sheets. By adopting the CNT–GR hybrid as a support for TiN, the BET surface area increased markedly (270 m2 g−1), only slightly less than that of TiN/CNT. This trend of BET surface area was consistent with that of nanocarbon supports without TiN.47Fig. 5b shows the BJH pore size distribution plot. Sharp peaks shown at 3.5 nm in every catalyst may be originated from the pores in TiN NPs. In addition, all carbon supported catalysts developed larger pores of 7–20 nm in the following order: GR ≪ CNTs < CNT–GR. Thus the total pore volume of TiN/CNT–GR (0.5460 cm3 g−1) was the highest, followed by TiN/CNT (0.4744 cm3 g−1), TiN/GR (0.3456 cm3 g−1), and bare TiN (0.2404 cm3 g−1). Large pores could play an important role in electrochemical reactions, because they could facilitate the contact between catalysts and electrolyte. The creation of large pores may come from the formation of 3-D structure between 1-D CNTs and 2-D GR, which avoids the stacking of GR and bundling of CNTs as shown in the schematic diagram in Fig. 3d.

Electrochemical properties and oxygen reduction reaction
Electrochemical properties of synthesized catalysts were investigated by CV and the results are shown in Fig. 6a. As confirmed in CV results of TMNs (Fig. 1), bare TiN was highly stable in the potential range of ORR. Nanocarbon supported TiN catalysts were also stable, showing saturated current densities before the 20th scan without any sign of corrosion. Most interesting in the CV results was the huge double layer-induced current exhibited by TiN/CNT–GR in spite of its lower BET surface area than TiN/CNT. The large pores in TiN/CNT–GR (see Fig. 5b) created by the formation of a 3-D structure between CNTs and GR could promote the contact with the electrolyte, thus resulted in the largest double layer current.

Nanocarbon supported TiN catalysts showed enhanced onset potentials of 0.8 V for TiN/GR and TiN/CNT, and 0.83 V for TiN/CNT–GR compared to 0.6 V for bare TiN. The good conductivity of carbon support materials may serve to increase the activity of TiN NPs for ORR. The onset potential of TiN/CNT–GR was comparable to those of Pd-based catalysts synthesized by simple chemical reduction or thermal decomposition methods, which are frequently studied for ORR as a substitute for Pt. Reported onset potentials of Pd-based catalysts for ORR were between 0.6 and 0.9 V. For example, 0.68 V for Pd/C,10,11 0.83 V for PdFe/C,10 0.82 V for PdV/C,11 and 0.80 V for PdCo/C.9 In general, onset potentials of Pd-based catalysts are highly affected by synthetic methods. Morphology controlled Pd-based catalysts, such as Pd or PdFe nanorods, exhibited high onset potentials of 0.9 V.48,49 However, Pd and Pd alloys have a durability problem due to dissolution of Pd or leaching of 2nd metals in acid media,50 and Pd is a relatively expensive noble metal itself.
In addition to enhancement in onset potential, TiN/CNT–GR exhibited higher ORR current density than bare and other supported TiN catalysts in the whole potential range. Particularly, it showed enhanced activity in the high potential region (i.e. in the low overpotential region). The ORR current density (JORR) of our TiN/CNT–GR at 0.8 V (−0.4 mA cm−2) and 0.7 V (−1.4 mA cm−2) represents the best values among the reported nitride-based catalysts, including carbon supported Mo and W nitrides (not active at 0.7 V),14,15 TaON (−5 μA cm−2 at 0.7 V),7 Zr, Nb, and Ta-based CNO (−0.1 mA cm−2 at 0.7 V),13 and TiN/CB (−0.6 mA cm−2 at 0.7 V).12 The activities of nitride-based materials for ORR are summarized in Table S3.† High activity in the high potential region is of importance considering the operation of single cells. This activity enhancement in TiN/CNT–GR is ascribed to the increased number of active sites (TiN NPs) accessible by the electrolyte due to the unique morphology of the CNT–GR hybrid with markedly increased large mesopores, as the structural properties of TiN NPs (including primary particle sizes) were similar both in supported and bare TiN catalysts as confirmed by XRD and XAFS analyses. This also leads us to attribute the difference in ORR performance among different nanocarbon supports to their different morphologies. For TiN NPs loaded on the CNT–GR hybrid, the chances to contact with the electrolyte increase owing to the abundant large mesopores, thus more TiN NPs could participate in the ORR process and contribute to the increased current density. The ORR activity of TiN/CNT–GR is not that much inferior to the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts, which exhibit high onset potentials of 0.95–1.0 V with high current density (−1 mA cm−2 at 0.9 V).44,50 The activities of TiN-based catalysts were compared with that of Pt/C and are shown in Fig. S7a.† Besides high activity, the ORR performance of the TiN/CNT–GR catalyst did not decrease significantly after 500 cycles of potential sweep between 0.6 and 1.0 V, indicating a good stability for ORR, as shown in Fig. S7b.†
As discussed in the previous section, nitrogen-doped carbon could be formed inadvertently in supported TiN catalysts under the synthetic conditions involving carbon, urea as a nitrogen source, and high temperature. To clarify the influence of nitrogen-doped carbon on ORR activity in our catalysts, we carried out various sets of LSV measurements for a reference nitrogen-doped carbon sample (urea/CNT–GR) prepared by the same synthetic method of TiN/CNT–GR but in the absence of Ti precursor. In addition, to identify the effect of nanocarbon support on ORR, TiN powders were physically mixed with the CNT–GR hybrid support (TiN–CNT–GR). As shown in Fig. S8,† relative to bare TiN, urea/CNT–GR exhibited the similar onset potential (0.6 V) and a slightly increased activity for ORR. The onset potential of 0.6 V was reported in nitrogen-doped carbon showing a moderate activity for ORR.51,52 The performance is in stark contrast to TiN/CNT–GR that exhibited an enhanced onset potential of 0.83 V and a marked increase in ORR activity. Thus, the formation of nitrogen-doped carbon had an insignificant effect on the active phase of ORR in our TiN/CNT–GR. Physically mixed TiN–CNT–GR showed an onset potential of 0.8 V, and ORR activity was slightly better than urea/CNT–GR, but much lower than TiN/CNT–GR. The result indicates that the strong TiN–support interaction is essential for the high ORR activity. Essentially the same observation was made for TiN/CNT (Fig. S9†) and TiN/GR (Fig. S10†). Therefore, the effect of nanocarbon supports, not that of nitrogen-doped carbon, was the dominant reason for the enhanced ORR activity of TiN/CNT–GR. Nitrogen-doped carbon may have merely contributed to the increased current density below 0.6 V.
In addition to the improved textural properties of carbon-supported TiN, the nanostructured carbons could also provide a highly conductive electron pathway to enhance the performance of the electrocatalyst. Thus, the electron transport process occurring in bare and carbon-supported TiN was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 7a shows the Nyquist plots of EIS measurements for the synthesized catalysts. The Nyquist plots were also fitted with a simple equivalent RC circuit model shown in Fig. 7b, which consisted of charge-transfer resistances (Rct) across the interfaces present in the electrocatalyst and constant phase elements (CPE) in parallel, and the resulting fitting parameters are summarized in Fig. 7b. A semicircle shown in the Nyquist plot is closely related to the interfacial charge transfer process at the catalyst–electrolyte interface.

The high frequency region was magnified and shown in the inset. (b) The equivalent circuit model and relevant fitting values to fit the measured EIS spectra. 
Compared to the bare TiN, supported TiN catalysts showed increased simulated capacitances indicating increased surface areas of the catalyst layer, which were consistent with PSD (Fig. 5b) and CV (Fig. 6a) results. In particular, TiN/CNT–GR exhibited 20 times higher capacitance value than that of bare TiN, which revealed the effectiveness of the CNT–GR hybrid as a catalyst support providing a high surface area. Introduction of carbon supports also greatly decreased the charge transfer resistance (Rct), which varied inversely with the activity of the electrocatalysts. The lowest value of Rct in TiN/CNT–GR (2.25 kΩ) was nearly 15 times lower than that of bare TiN (33.5 kΩ), which is consistent with its highest electrocatalytic activity for ORR.
Thus, the EIS results lead us to conclude that the enhanced activity of TiN/CNT–GR for ORR mainly originated from the synergistic effect between TiN NPs and CNT–GR hybrid support, roles of which were to act as active sites for ORR, and to provide a large surface area and a facile electron pathway to TiN NPs, respectively. Introduction of the CNT–GR hybrid support does not affect much of the properties of TiN itself except hindering the aggregation of NPs, but it dramatically improves its ORR activity by two major roles. First, it provides large mesopores due to the formation of a 3-D like morphology assembled from 1-D CNTs and 2-D GR, which allows easy access of the electrolyte to active TiN sites. Second, it provides a highly conductive electron pathway that shuttles electrons from an external circuit to TiN NPs. For the second role, electric connectivity between TiN and the support should be critical, and such a close interaction seems realized in the present system because the support hinders the aggregation of TiN NPs and there are no free-standing NPs away from the support.
Methanol tolerance of supported TiN electrocatalysts
An efficient ORR catalyst is needed for both PEMFCs and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). For application in DMFCs, ORR catalysts should satisfy an additional requirement, i.e. satisfactory tolerance to methanol that crossed from the anode side through the membrane. Methanol tolerance properties of the TiN/CNT–GR catalyst were investigated in comparison with a commercial Pt/C (E-TEK) catalyst using CV and LSV measurements in the presence of 0.1 M methanol. During the CV measurement, the Pt/C catalyst showed typical large oxidation peaks in a methanol-containing sulfuric acid solution (Fig. 8c). However, regardless of the presence of methanol, TiN/CNT–GR exhibited no oxidation peaks in its CV traces as shown in Fig. 8a. Like CV results, Pt/C showed a large oxidation peak again in the LSV trace, indicating a drastic decrease in the ORR activity (Fig. 8d). In contrast, TiN/CNT–GR showed little activity loss (Fig. 8b) indicating an excellent tolerance to methanol. Thus, CV and LSV results in the presence of methanol demonstrate the potential use of TiN/CNT–GR as a promising methanol tolerant cathode catalyst for DMFCs.

Conclusions
Five TMNs (Mo2N, W2N, NbN, Ta3N5, and TiN) were synthesized by the urea-glass route and screened for their electrochemical stability and activity for ORR by CV and LSV. The electrochemical stability could be aligned as Mo2N ≪ W2N < NbN, Ta3N5, TiN, whereas the activity was aligned as W2N < NbN, Ta3N5 ≪ TiN < Mo2N. The selected TiN was modified with nanocarbon supports for further improved activities for ORR. Nanocarbon-supported TiN NPs exhibited small particle sizes of TiN (<7 nm) and a good TiN–support interaction with reduced aggregation and no free-standing TiN particles away from the supports compared to bare TiN. In particular, TiN/CNT–GR showed much higher ORR activity than other reported nitride-based catalysts as well as bare TiN, TiN/GR, and TiN/CNT. This dramatic enhancement was ascribed to a synergistic effect between TiN NPs and CNT–GR hybrid, roles of which were to provide active sites for ORR and an electron pathway to TiN NPs, respectively. In addition, TiN/CNT–GR exhibited the formation of large mesopores due to the formation of 3-D like CNT–GR structure assembled between 2-D GR and 1-D CNTs, which could allow easy access of the electrolyte. Furthermore, TiN/CNT–GR also showed a good methanol tolerance for DMFCs, indicating that our TiN/CNT–GR could be a promising ORR electrocatalyst for DMFCs as well as PEMFCs.
