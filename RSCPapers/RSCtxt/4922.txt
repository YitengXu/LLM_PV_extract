    , Accepted 15th November 2018First published on 16th November 2018AbstractThe resonantly enhanced near-surface electromagnetic field of Al nanostructures (NSs) excited with UV light offers an effective and precise approach to obtain vibration information in complex mixtures up to a single-molecule magnitude. In this work, we propose a facile, cost-effective and large-scale way to fabricate self-assembled Al NSs with systematically controllable configuration and size for the preparation of SERS substrates. The stalagmite-shaped Al nanoparticles (NPs) are directly utilized based on the Volmer–Weber model and drastically develop as a function of the annealing temperature with tunable optical properties, resulting in a maximum enhancement factor of the vibrational Raman signal from adenine molecules up to 3.49 × 107. With a variation of the deposition thickness at an identical temperature, the self-assembled Al NSs sensitively evolve from stalagmite-shaped NPs to worm-like nano-mounds with increased light consumption induced by scattering, which inherently leads to a noticeable reduction in the EF due to the reduced plasmon coupling between NSs with the sparse distribution. The enhancement effect of the SERS substrates is theoretically discussed with the FDTD simulation, providing an instructive reference for promising applications in the bio-sensing technique.
Introduction
The surface electromagnetic (EM) field of metallic nanostructures (NSs) can be spontaneously enhanced with incident light excitation owing to coherently oscillating electrons, known as localized surface plasmon resonance, offering an effective approach to increase absorption and scattering at the near-field.1–3 Therefore, the metallic NSs, especially noble metals,4–6 have been regarded as a suitable candidate for achieving high emission efficiency,7,8 energy conversion efficiency,9–11 and sensitivity12,13 for LEDs, solar cells, and various sensors at an identical wavelength, which can be facilely tunable depending on the shape and size of the metallic NSs.14 Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), as an extremely sensitive detecting technique based on the plasmonic resonance on metallic NSs, is capable of obtaining vibration information even up to a single-molecule magnitude, which has evoked tremendous research interest with exponentially increasing numbers of published papers reaching 15857 since 1974.15 Given that the absorption lines of proteins and many DNA based molecules are located in the UV region, the UV SERS substrates become desirable to selectively analyse the vibrational behaviour of particular species in complex mixtures at relatively low concentrations.16
Constrained by the interband transitions, the classical plasmonic materials, gold and silver,17 commonly undergo the plasmon damping for wavelengths below 400 nm, which in turn severely limits the applications in the UV spectral region. Compared with the noble metals, as a naturally abundant and economical material, Al nanoplasmonics have attracted increasing research interest due to their intrinsic properties,18 which can be potentially employed in devices within a wide wavelength range from the UV to the near-IR regions.19 Additionally, the plasmonic coupling of the Ag nanostructures (NSs) usually degrades over time due to their anabatic oxidation,20 which can be effectively avoided by the self-terminating oxidation on the Al surface.21 To date, rapid and productive fabrication of metallic NSs has become essential to modern science and technology, which can be mostly achieved by chemical synthesis22 and nanolithography.23 The chemical synthesis of the metallic NSs has been well developed for the preparation of various-shaped NSs, which commonly suffers from complex reactants and the challenge of SERS substrates fabricated using liquid solutions.24 Meanwhile, nanolithography can guarantee high uniformity of the NS arrays but is accompanied by high expense in terms of time-consuming and complicated processes,25 and the arrays can easily peel off due to the weak binding between metallic NSs and substrates.
In this work, we demonstrate a facile, cost-effective and large-scale fabrication approach with high mechanical stability to utilize the self-assembled Al NSs on glass as UV SERS substrates for adenine molecule detection. With systematic control over the annealing temperature and the deposition thickness, the self-assembled Al NSs undergo an apparent evolution in terms of size and configuration, resulting in a tunable plasmonic resonance along with the morphological evolution. The prominent intensified vibrational signals from adenine molecules excited using a 325 nm laser are witnessed from each SERS substrate, and the maximum EF reaches 3.49 × 107, suggesting an ingenious and efficient way for the preparation of the UV SERS substrate as a potential tool of the DNA sequencing project.26
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the morphological evolution of the self-assembled Al nanoparticles (NPs) with an identical deposition thickness of 6 nm by varying the annealing temperatures from 200 to 650 °C for 900 s. The AFM side-views are shown in Fig. 1(a)–(e), and the height and diameter distribution histograms of the resulting Al NPs are revealed in Fig. 1(a-1)–(e-1) and (a-2)–(e-2), respectively. The corresponding AFM top-views are shown in Fig. S1(a)–S1(e),† and the cross-sectional line-profiles and 2D FFT power spectra obtained from the AFM top-views are presented in Fig. S1(a-1)–(e-1) and (a-2)–(e-2);† the surface morphologies were uniform throughout the whole temperature range as shown in Fig. S2.† The elemental mapping for Al, O and Si was also carried out and is shown in Fig. S3.† In general, the stalagmite-shaped Al NPs directly formed after deposition, and sensitively responded to the annealing temperatures, resulting in a radically morphological development along with the elevated temperatures. specifically, the tiny stalagmite-shaped Al NPs were directly fabricated with packed distribution after evaporation as shown in Fig. 1(a), (a-1) and (a-2). As shown in Fig. 1(b), the Al NPs slightly expanded at 200 °C, leading to the isotopically increased size as seen in Fig. 1(b-1) and (b-2). From the EDS analysis, it can be found that the resultant nanostructure is evenly distributed throughout the surface indicating the formation of Al. Similarly, from the EDS spectra, the peak appeared at ∼1.5 keV which demonstrates the existence of aluminum. With further increase in temperature between 500 and 600 °C, the surface morphologies drastically developed as shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d), resulting in a significant size expansion as evidenced in Fig. 1(c-1)–(d-1) and (c-2)–(d-2). Fig. 2 depicts the growth mechanism of the self-assembled Al NPs with the increased annealing temperatures. The development of the average height (AH), average diameter (AD), average density and average distance of the resulting Al NPs is plotted in Fig. 2(e) and (f), and the root-mean-square roughness (RRMS) and the surface area difference (SAD) as a function of the annealing temperature are presented in Fig. 2(g) and (h). The corresponding values are summarized in Table 1. Initially, as illustrated in Fig. 2(a), given that the binding energy between Al adatoms (γAl) was relatively stronger than that between Al adatoms and the quartz substrate (γI), the Al adatoms were inclined to spontaneously nucleate into tiny NPs after deposition based on the Volmer–Weber growth model27 as clearly seen in Fig. S1(a) and (a-1).† Compared with Al, the Au NPs can be commonly fabricated at a relatively higher temperature above 200 °C (ref. 28) due to the relatively lower binding energy of Au atoms than that of Al.29 By providing them with thermal energy, the Al adatoms can be excited to nucleate into larger NPs as shown in Fig. 2(b), and the annealing temperature (T) dependent diffusion length (lD) of the Al adatoms can be expressed by:30 (1)

where D0 is the ideal diffusion coefficient constant, γE is the diffusion barrier, k is the Boltzmann constant, and τ is the diffusion time. Thus, the lD can be exponentially determined from the T, and a much more radical agglomeration of Al adatoms can be expected with the increased annealing temperatures as shown in Fig. 2(c). As a result, the morphological evolution occurred much more drastically as shown in Fig. S1(b)–(d) and (c-2)–(d-2).† However, at 650 °C, the size of the Al NPs notably shrunk as shown in Fig. 1(e), leading to reduction in the height and diameter as revealed in Fig. 1(e-1)–(e-2). Herein, the sublimation rate (rS) of Al adatoms can be directly deduced from the T and equilibrium vapor pressure (Peq):31 (2)where MAl is the atomic weight of Al (26.98) and the Peq increases exponentially as a function of the T. In addition, the melting point of the bulk Al is ∼660 °C,32 indicating a much higher Peq at 650 °C. Therefore, we can expect a relatively smaller size of Al NPs at higher temperature due to the accelerated rS. As a result, when the temperature increased to 200 °C, the AH and AD slightly increased by 1.2 and 1.1 times due to the unfavourable surface diffusion as shown in Fig. 2(e). Meanwhile, between 200 and 600 °C, the AH and AD exponentially increased by 7.4 and 2.5 times because of the enhanced surface diffusion. At 650 °C, the AH radically dropped from 19.9 to 11.5 nm, and the AD similarly decreased from 63.1 to 42.2 nm due to the accelerated sublimation. To compensate for the size expansion, the average density of the Al NPs continuously decreased from 6.45 × 1010 to 7.49 × 109 cm−2 and the average distance tended to increase at the same time as shown in Fig. 2(f). Correspondingly, the RRMS and SAD consistently increased by 6.9 and 15.8 times with the increase in temperature, suggesting an enlarged surface area with control of the annealing temperature. As shown in Fig. 2(g) and (h), the RRMS and SAD eventually dropped to 2.2 nm and 2.2%, respectively. The topological evolution can be also witnessed from the gradually shrinking bright spot in the 2D FFT power spectra, manifesting that the vertical size increase was as a function of the annealing temperature.
The tuneable optical properties controlled by the topological development of the self-assembled Al NPs fabricated at various temperatures between 200 and 650 °C are shown in Fig. 3. The absorption and transmittance spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), and the average absorption and transmittance over a range between 200 and 1000 nm are revealed in Fig. 3(c) and (d). Generally, regardless of the configuration of the Al NPs, the characteristic absorption and transmission peaks were observed for each sample, and the blue shift of the peaks occurred along with the morphological evolution. Noticeably, for the tiny Al NPs fabricated below 200 °C, the absorption exhibited a broadened band throughout the whole wavelength range with a center peak at ∼780 nm as a result of significant electromagnetic (EM) dipole resonances among the packed Al NPs,33,34 as shown in Fig. 3(a). Nevertheless, the absorption band began to obviously shrink at relatively higher annealing temperatures owing to the drastic configuration variation, and a gradual blue shift of the absorption bands occurred below 400 nm as a function of the annealing temperature. As a piece of evidence, a similar behaviour was witnessed in the transmittance spectra depending on the evolution of the Al NPs as shown in Fig. 3(b). Additionally, depending on the surface morphology, as shown in Fig. 3(c), the absorbance underwent an evolution within two phases: for the dense Al NPs, the average absorbance was 17% owing to the wide range absorption within the wavelength range. Meanwhile, for the sparsely distributed Al NPs, the absorbance significantly decreased to 3%, suggesting an enhanced transmittance over the visible range as evidenced in Fig. 3(d).

The Raman analytes, aqueous adenine solution with a concentration of 1 mM, in which the vibrational signals are spatially separated at 1248, 1332, 1484, and 1601 cm−1 (ref. 35) (Table 2), were employed for the validation of the surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates with the Al NPs. Strikingly, each characteristic vibration mode was sharply enhanced on the SERS substrates compared to the signals acquired from the bare quartz substrate as shown in Fig. 4(a). The Raman signals of the absorbed adenine molecules on SERS substrates were excited using a 325 nm laser with a spot diameter of 1 μm as shown in Fig. 4(b). Fig. 4(c) shows the peak intensity of 1332 cm−1 Raman vibration mode (I1332) and the corresponding enhancement factor (EF) for each sample is plotted in Fig. 4(d) (calculations in the ESI†). The I1332 constantly decreased along with the elevated annealing temperatures as shown in Fig. 4(c), which can be ascribed to the obvious reduction in the effective area for signal enhancement. Correspondingly, the EF exhibited a similar trend, resulting in a maximum value of 3.49 × 107. To theoretically understand the high Raman signal enhancement of the stalagmite-shaped Al NPs, the EM field distribution of the resulting stalagmite-shaped Al NPs with different sizes was simulated by a finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The configuration of the Al NPs was the averaged value acquired from the AFM images as summarized in Table 1, and each NP was coated with a 3 nm native oxide layer. As shown in Fig. 4(e) and (h), the EM distribution of the dense tiny Al NPs appeared much more intense than that of the sparse ones, and the electromagnetic enhancement was highly localized in the gap regions between NPs. Correspondingly, the magnitude of the maximally enhanced EF (E/E0) was 40 times higher than that of the incident light. However, only 6 times enhancement was obtained from the larger sparse NPs, which indicated that the electromagnetic enhancement can be determined from the gap between NPs.

The deposition thickness effects on the morphological evolution of the self-assembled Al nanostructures (NSs) from the stalagmite-shaped NPs to worm-like nano-mounds (NMs) are shown in Fig. 5. Compared with the temperature effect, a slight variation of the deposition thickness tended to induce a radical morphological development including the size and configuration of the Al NSs based on the coalescence model36 as shown in Fig. 5(a)–(d) and Fig. S6(a)–(d).† That is, the irregular dimension expansion of the Al NSs homogeneously occurred along the transversal and longitudinal directions as observed from the AFM top-views in Fig. S5(a)–(d),† resulting in the reduced area of the exposed substrate as shown by the shrinking bright spot of the 2D FFT power spectra in Fig. S5(a-3)–(d-3).† Therefore, as shown in Fig. 5(e), the RRMS significantly increased by 20 times owing to the predominantly axial aggregation of the Al NSs between 6 and 8 nm. Subsequently, the axial agglomeration of the Al NSs gradually saturated, leading to the decrease of the RRMS owing to the accelerated in-plane growth. To verify the element distribution of the resulting Al NSs, the worm-like nano-mounds (NMs) were analysed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as shown in Fig. S3.† As obviously witnessed from the elemental maps (Fig. 5(g)–(i)), the O was evenly detected over the surface and the Al was only observed within the NMs. Similarly, Kα peaks of Al and Si were observed at 1.48 keV and 1.74 keV in the EDS spectra as shown in Fig. S4(a).37 As revealed by the XPS spectra in Fig. S3(b) and (c),† the Al2O3 peak at 74.3 eV increased after annealing, indicating the formation of the Al2O3 cap layers on Al NSs at the expense of Al atoms.38

The variation of the optical properties for the self-assembled Al NSs fabricated with different configurations is revealed in Fig. 6. With the increase in the deposition thickness, the absorption of the resulting samples gradually increased owing to the increased coverage rate by the self-assembled Al NSs as witnessed from the absorption spectra in Fig. 6(a), resulting in the increase from 6% to 17% as shown in Fig. 6(b). Correspondingly, the transmitted light intensity slowly decreased as a function of the deposition thickness as observed in Fig. 6(d).

The configuration effects of the Al NSs on the Raman signals obtained from the adenine molecules are shown in Fig. 7. Likewise, each vibrational mode of adenine was significantly enhanced by the Al NS substrate as shown in Fig. 7(a). The I1332 as a function of the deposition thickness is plotted in Fig. 7(b) and the corresponding EF values of each sample are shown in Fig. 7(c). From 6 to 8 nm, the I1332 decreased due to the significant reduction in the density of Al NSs during agglomeration, and correspondingly, the EF also sharply decreased from 5.5 × 106 to 3.3 × 105 as a result of diminished plasmon coupling between Al NSs with the widened distance. Subsequently, with the further increased deposition thickness, the intensity kept increasing as clearly seen in Fig. 7(b), which manifested a noticeable enhancement of the Raman vibrations of the adenine molecules to compensate for the deduction of the Al NSs due to intensified scattering. Therefore, the EF slowly increased to 6.4 × 105 along with the morphological evolution as shown in Table 3, which was still much lower than that of 6 nm due to the moderated plasmon coupling. Fig. 7(e) and (g) show the simulated EM field distribution of the Al NSs in different configurations as depicted in Fig. 7(d) and (f). According to the simulation, the worm-like Al NMs exhibited much stronger light attenuation surrounding the NMs than that of the stalagmite-shaped NPs, which can be supposedly induced by much more radical scattering.

The limit of detection of the resultant SERS sensor was determined by carrying out SERS measurements on the sample annealed at 200 °C for different concentrations of adenine from 1 mM to 100 nM, the sensitivity of aluminium NPs can effectively reach 100 nM as evidenced in Fig. 8(a) and (a-1). Meanwhile, the Raman signals were evenly distributed as shown in the Raman map in Fig. 8(b). The adenine spectra extracted from the three points from the map appeared similar, which confirmed that the SERS substrate possessed good reproducibility. As shown in Fig. 8(d), the adenine SERS spectra were comparable for the sample fabricated after three months, suggesting excellent stability of the SERS substrates due to the self-terminated oxidation of Al NSs. This long term stable and reproducible performance of the SERS substrates can make them suitable as robust platforms for the UV-SERS study.

Conclusions
In summary, we reported the precise control of the annealing temperature and deposition thickness on the fabrication of self-assembled Al NSs for the preparation of UV SERS substrates with high sensitivity and stability. With the increased annealing temperatures, the Al NPs spontaneously aggregated with 6 nm deposition based on the Volmer–Weber growth model, and gradually developed in size and density owing to the enhanced surface diffusion. The evolution of the Al NPs inherently induced a decreasing light absorption due to the degraded coupling among NPs, and the maximum EF was obtained with the packed Al NPs as deposited. With the variation of the deposition thicknesses, a drastic configuration development was observed from the stalagmite-shaped Al NPs to worm-liked Al NMs, correspondingly inducing a strengthened scattering around Al NSs. The EM field distribution of the Al NSs with various configurations was calculated to explain the tunable optical properties based on the FDTD simulation. The resultant SERS substrate exhibited outstanding stability and reproducibility, which can be promisingly adapted in the industrial manufacture of highly sensitive and reliable bio-sensing devices for applications within the UV regions.
Experimental
Fabrication of the self-assembled Al nanostructures
In this work, the fabrication of the self-assembled Al nanostructures (NSs) was carried out in a rapid temperature annealing (RTA) system on quartz substrates. Prior to the growth, substrates with a size of 2 × 2 cm2 were initially subjected to a sonication process in deionized water and acetone for 5 min to remove surface contamination, respectively. Subsequently, each substrate was degassed at 500 °C under 1 × 10−4 Torr for 1800 s in a RTA furnace to desorb water and particles. To investigate the deposition thickness effect on the evolution of the Al NSs, the variations of the deposition thicknesses between 6 and 20 nm were determined at a growth rate of 2 Å s−1 with an ionization current of 3 mA under 1 × 10−4 Torr via thermal evaporation. For the annealing temperature effect, samples with an identical deposition thickness of 6 nm were annealed at various temperatures between 200 and 650 °C for 900 s at a ramping rate of 10 °C s−1 and directly quenched down to room temperature.
Morphology and elemental analysis of Al nanostructures
Subsequent to the fabrication, surface morphologies were characterized by using an atomic force microscope (AFM, Bruker Dimension Edge) in tapping mode at a resonant frequency of 270 kHz. To minimize the tip convolution effects, AFM characterization was performed with the same type of tip from a single batch. The acquired data were analysed by the NanoScope Analysis (Bruker Corporation) including AFM top-views and side-views, cross-sectional line-profiles, and FFT power spectra. The FFT power spectrum indicates the directional height distribution via converting the height information from the spatial domain to the frequency domain based on the Fourier filter transform. The surface area difference (SAD) was given as  
where αG is the geometric area in two-dimensions and αT is the topologic area in three-dimensions. Scanning electron microscopy (Gemini SEM 300, Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Corp) was adapted for the morphological characterization of the resulting Al NSs within a relatively larger area. The elemental analysis was performed with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) system (Gemini SEM 300, Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Corp.) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB250Xi) with an Al KR X-ray source. The XPS data of Al were baselined by the Shirley method and then fitted by Gaussian function as shown in Fig. S2(b) and S2(c).†
Optical properties and SERS measurement
The absorbance and transmittance spectra of the samples were recorded with a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (UV 3600 Plus, Japan) over the wavelength range between 200 and 1200 nm. For the SERS measurement, a 20 μL adenine (∼95% Purchase from Sigma-Aldrich) solution of 1 mM was dropped on the substrates and incubated for 2 h. The Raman spectra between 800 and 2000 cm−1 were recorded with a 15× objective lens of a Raman microscope (LabRAM HR800, Horiba Jobin Yvon Corp., France). The signals were obtained with excitation using the 325 nm UV He–Cd laser with a laser power of 0.3 mW to avoid any photo-degradation, and acquired with a grating of 1800 lines per mm. For the detection of sensitivity, 20 μL adenine solution from 1 mM to 100 nM was dropped on the SERS substrate with a 3 mW laser power and a 40× objective lens. For each sample, the exhibited Raman spectra were averaged out from Raman signals obtained at 6 random sites with an acquisition time of 10 s.
