    , Accepted 8th August 2018First published on 8th August 2018AbstractIn this work we aim to investigate the relationships among the ratios of vinyl linker, crystallinity and charge carrier mobility in a series of benzothiadiazole–quarterthiophene based conjugated polymers. Four polymers, PB4TV0, PB4TV1, PB4TV2 and PB4TV3, containing 0 to 3 vinyl linkers in the repeating unit were synthesized, and their corresponding bottom gate/bottom contact organic field effect transistors were fabricated and examined. The results manifest escalating hole mobilities along the increasing ratio of vinyl linker, with PB4TV3 reaching a high hole mobility up to 0.36 cm2 V−1 s−1. On the other hand, further investigations have revealed a gradual reduction in the crystallinity with rising vinyl ratio after a slight enhancement at first. The difference between the mobility and crystallinity variation tendency is caused by the combined influences of intra-chain charge transport enhancement and the conformational isomerization nature of the vinyl linker, which could provide new thoughts in designing high performance conjugated polymers for OFETs in future.
Introduction
Since the first development of an organic light emitting diode based on poly(phenylenevinylene) (PPV) in the 1990s,1,2 conjugated polymers have opened vast possibilities for organic electronics such as photovoltaics, sensors, transistors and batteries.3–9 High performance conjugated polymers with newly developed functional donor and acceptor groups have sprung up in the past decades, achieving power conversion efficiencies of over 10% in polymer solar cells10,11 and carrier mobility surpassing 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 for organic field effect transistors (OFETs).9,12–16 However, regardless of how it changes in the donor and acceptor structures, the linker connecting these functional groups still remains a crucial factor for the semiconducting properties of the conjugated polymers, even though the choice for a linker is rather limited. Nevertheless, researches in the effects of those linkers are still much less reported compared with the structure construction for donors and acceptors.17–23
Vinyl linkage is often considered the most conjugated connection among the three linking methods (direct link, by vinyl and by ethynyl).24,25 Nevertheless, in constructing a conjugated polymer for OFETs, the utilization of vinyl linkers is rather subtle. The carrier mobility in conjugated polymers is determined by two aspects, the inter-chain charge transport and intra-chain transport. It has been established that introducing vinyl can improve the conjugational length and co-planarity of the polymer backbone, and therefore improve the intra-chain charge transport.14,17,18 On the other hand, the vinyl linker possesses both a configurational (trans- & cis-) and a conformational isomerization nature, which could jeopardize the intermolecular packing in the solid state, and consequently reduce the inter-chain charge transport.26,27 The balance between the two sides of introducing a vinyl linker is hard to handle. For instance, while the carrier mobility in a single vinyl containing conjugated polymer PDVT (Fig. 1) has largely been improved to 4.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared with the non-vinyl polymer PDQT (0.97 cm2 V−1 s−1),18 a double vinyl containing polymer PBT6V2 exhibits an obvious diminishing mobility (2.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) compared with the original non-vinyl polymer PBT6 (0.75 cm2 V−1 s−1).28

It is a reasonable deduction that the probability of vinyl isomerization increases with increasing ratio, which would amplify the molecular packing disorder in the solid state, exhibiting a weakened crystallinity for the polymer, followed by a reduced inter-chain charge transport and lowered carrier mobility. Such is in accordance with the mobility and thin film analysis results from a former reference.28 Nevertheless, some exceptions have also been reported recently. For example, a multi-vinyl containing conjugated polymer PTBTV based on benzothiadiazole and dithiophene has exhibited a rather high hole mobility up to 3.2 cm2 V−1 s−1.14 Clearly, there is still a large scope in which to understand the regulations between the vinyl linkers and conjugated polymer functions. Meanwhile, practical research on the ratio effect of vinyl linkers is still rare.
In this work, we aim to investigate how the different vinyl ratios in a 4 donor (D)–1 acceptor (A) conjugated polymer system affects the carrier mobility for transistors. Four polymers—PB4TV0, PB4TV1, PB4TV2 and PB4TV3—based on benzothiadiazole and quarterthiophene were synthesized, with 0 to 3 vinyl linkers in the repeating unit of each polymer, respectively. Their carrier mobilities were obtained from the bottom contact bottom gate OFET devices fabricated with conventional technique, and their crystallinities as well as molecular packing were evaluated via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results manifest a continuously increasing hole mobility along with a rising vinyl ratio, yet a rather different variation tendency in crystallinity.
Results and discussions
Synthesis
The synthetic procedures are displayed in Scheme 1. Compounds 1 and 2 were obtained via methods from previous literature.8 Note that owing to the selectivity advantage from the reported synthetic route, vinyl linkers of compound 2 exhibit trans-configuration in an overwhelm majority.14 Since the following Stille polymerization doesn’t involve a configurational shift of vinylene, the three polymers containing vinyl linkers are all initially considered with major trans-configurational backbones. The molecular weights of the polymers are all evaluated by gel permeation chromatography with THF as the eluent. The results are Mn = 13.9 and PDI = 2.1 for PB4TV0, Mn = 18.5 and PDI = 2.7 for PB4TV1, Mn = 14.8 and PDI = 2.6 for PB4TV2, and Mn = 13.3 and PDI = 2.2 for PB4TV3.

Optical and electrochemical properties
A comparison of UV-Vis absorption spectra from the four polymers in both their solutions and thin films is included in Fig. 2. The four polymers exhibited similar absorption behaviors in solution, with maximum absorption peaks (λmax) at around 570 nm. Thin film absorption spectra for all four polymers exhibit strong shoulder peaks, which are considered to be related to the molecular aggregation in the solid state. The detailed characteristics of the absorption spectra are summarized in Table 1. Interestingly, a secondary absorption peak at 740 nm was also observed for PB4TV1 in the solution state, which indicates a possible pre-aggregation. This phenomenon is believed to be owing to the strong inter-chain interaction, which usually echoes with a highly ordered crystallinity in the solid state.29 This also reflects a possibly stronger molecular aggregation state for PB4TV1 in the solid state among the four polymers, which is in accordance with the further grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) evaluation results.

The cyclic voltammetry curves of the four polymers are also displayed in Fig. 2. The corresponding highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels were estimated and are included in Table 1 too. Notably, the onset oxidation potentials gradually blue shifted as the number of vinyl linkers in the polymer increased, corresponding to an escalating HOMO level along the raised ratio of vinylene. The non-vinyl containing PB4TV0 exhibited a HOMO of −5.65 eV, whereas PB4TV1, PB4TV2 and PB4TV3 showed HOMOs of −5.50, −5.48 and −5.41 eV, respectively. This complied with the previous literature that introducing a vinyl linkage would lead to a strengthened co-planarity of the polymer backbone and extended conjugational length, and thus a higher HOMO level is in order.17 Density functional theory calculations for the corresponding oligomers (n = 2) of the four polymers were also carried out. The results of the dihedral angle between the functional units showed good agreement with our expectation (see Fig. S2 for details, ESI†).
Thin film morphology and crystallinity
Thermal gravimetric analysis indicated that all four polymers possess a fine stability, with decomposition temperatures over 350 °C (see ESI† for details), and the DSC curves of the four polymers are as shown in Fig. 3. As depicted, PB4TV0 exhibits three clear endothermic peaks at Tm1 = 36 °C, Tm2 = 107 °C and Tm3 = 185 °C in the heating process, while an exothermic peak at Tc3 = 172 °C can still be observed in the cooling cycle. According to the previous literature, Tm1 is possibly related to the melting of the alkyl, whereas Tm2 and Tm3 correspond to the melting of the main chain crystalline phase.28 The coexistence of these thermal peaks is suggested to represent a smectic-like layered arrangement of the polymer chains in the solid state.30 Similarly, PB4TV1 exhibits endothermic peaks at Tm1′ = 115 °C and Tm2′ = 186 °C, while Tc2′ = 168 °C can be observed in the cooling process. On the other hand, for PB4TV2 only one endothermic peak, Tm1′′ = 221 °C, was revealed during the whole heat flowing cycle, whereas for PB4TV3 no obvious thermal effect was observed at all. These results reflect a relatively higher crystallinity for PB4TV0 and PB4TV1 in the solid state.§

To further evaluate the relationship between the crystallinity and vinyl ratio, GIXRD and AFM measurements of the optimized thin films of the four polymers were carried out.¶ As depicted in Fig. 4, PB4TV0 exhibited two ordered lamellar peaks at 2θ = 4.6° (100) and 9.1° (200) for the out-of-plane direction, corresponding to a d-spacing of 19.2 Å, and a π–π interaction peak at 22.5° (3.9 Å) for the in-plane direction. This indicates a typical ‘edge on’ molecular orientation for PB4TV0 in the solid state, which is believed to be a better packing mode for interchain charge hopping than the ‘face on’ orientation.31–35 Meanwhile, the AFM image also revealed small lamellar crystal structures for a thin film of PTB0V. Interestingly, for PB4TV1, the lamellar peaks for the out-of-plane direction extended to the third order, which are 2θ = 5.0° (100), 10.0° (200) and 15.0° (300), corresponding to a d-spacing of 17.6 Å, similar to that from PB4TV0. The π–π interaction peak for the in-plane direction was also observed at around 23° (3.9 Å). These results manifest the same ‘edge on’ packing but stronger crystallinity for PB4TV1 than PB4TV0. The AFM image from the thin film of PB4TV1 also corroborates this conclusion. As is shown, the thin film of PB4TV1 exhibits an obvious larger grain size and clearer boundaries than those of PB4TV0. As for PB4TV2 and PB4TV3, they also exhibited ‘edge on’ molecular orientations in the solid state. However, their lamellar peaks for the out-of-plane direction reduced to two orders and one peak, respectively, and their corresponding thin film AFM images exhibited no obvious crystalline structure. Yet their π–π interaction peaks for the in-plane direction still exist, with a distance of 3.9 Å. These results suggest a reduced crystallinity for PB4TV2 and PB4TV3 than that of PB4TV1. The detailed GIXRD characteristics are also included in Table 1. Notably, despite the similar π–π interaction distance, the four polymers exhibit slight different lamellar d-spacings. This might be related to the linearity of the polymer backbone, among which the more waved backbones usually exhibit longer d-spacing.8

From the analysis above, a relationship between the vinyl ratio and polymer crystallinity can be drawn. In the 1A–4D based system, in our case, the benzothiadiazole–quarterthiophene conjugated polymers, when introducing one vinyl, crystallinity is slightly strengthened. This is in accordance with many reported cases, suggesting that in the TVT structure, the existence of vinylene has increased the rotation potential energy between the two thiophenes, thus resulting in a strengthened planarity,18,36–39 yet the effect of vinylene conformational isomerization is not so significant, since the vinyl ratio is relatively low. Nevertheless, when the ratio of vinylene increases, in this case, for PB4TV2 and PB4TV3, the isomerization effect of vinylene is amplified, which leads to a gradually reduced crystallinity. The crystallinity sequence of the four polymers can be summarized as PB4TV1 > PB4TV0 > PB4TV2 > PB4TV3. Notably, this echoes well with the absorption spectra results suggesting a pre-aggregation for the PB4TV1 in solution state. In addition, the deduction on the amplification of the isomerization effects has been partially verified by the FT-IR spectra analysis (see Fig. S4 in ESI† for details).
OFET characteristics
As mentioned previously, it is usually believed that charge carrier mobility is positively related to material crystallinity in the solid state.40 Thus, according to the crystallinity results, PB4TV1 should possess the highest charge carrier mobility among the four polymers. However, the actual results are otherwise. The bottom contact/bottom gate (BGBC) OFET devices of the four polymers were fabricated via a conventional spin coating technique. All the devices were examined in ambient conditions and their corresponding output and transfer characteristics were measured as displayed in Fig. 5. As is shown, all of the four polymers exhibit typical p-type properties with devices working under a negative voltage. The highest device performance was obtained from PB4TV3 after annealing at 160 °C, with a hole mobility up to 0.36 cm2 V−1 s−1, on/off ratio of 106, threshold voltage of −5 V. Mobilities of PB4TV1 and PB4TV2 up to 0.20 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, were also obtained after annealing at 160 °C. These three polymers show no further performance improvement after further annealing at higher temperatures. Meanwhile, PB4TV0 exhibited the hole mobility only up to 0.063 cm2 V−1 s−1 after annealing at 120 °C, which is similar to the previous literature.8 Detailed performances of the OFET devices based on the four polymers are included in Table 1.

It seems that the carrier mobility increases along with the vinyl ratio in our benzothiadiazole–quarterthiophene based conjugated polymer system. A brief summary regarding the vinyl ratio, crystallinity and carrier mobility is included in Fig. 6, with the crystalline intensity simply represented by the lamellar diffraction orders. As mentioned previously, for PB4TV1, the introduction of vinyl slightly strengthened the crystallinity. Accordingly, in PB4TV1, both the intra-chain and inter-chain charge transport should be enhanced, and therefore a large mobility improvement from PB4TV1 to PB4TV0 was achieved. However, for PB4TV2 and PB4TV3, the crystallinity is gradually weakened due to the conformational disorders in the solid state, and thus the inter-chain charge transport should be reduced. Nevertheless, the additional vinyl linkers have also brought extra enhancement to the intra-chain charge transport, which might be enough to overcome the inter-chain charge transport reduction. Therefore, escalating mobilities for PB4TV2 and PB4TV3 with the further increased vinyl ratio are still feasible. Notably, despite the lowered lamellar crystallinity, PB4TV2 and PB4TV3 still possess a considerable π–π intermolecular interaction bridge for charge hopping, which is crucial for maintaining a higher charge carrier mobility in the solid state.

Traditionally, increasing the crystallinity of a conjugated polymer has been deemed as an effective way to enhance charge carrier mobility in OFETs. However, such methods would be inevitably stalled due to the semi-crystalline nature of conjugated polymers. Our present work has shown that fusing multiple vinyl linkers into D–A conjugated polymers possesses promising potential in designing high performance materials for OFETs. Furthermore, such methods could provide high mobility materials with relatively low crystallinity, which are more suitable for flexible devices due to their better mechanical resilience.40 It also corroborates the latest studies, which suggest that charge transport in semiconducting polymers predominantly occurs along the back-bone, which requires only occasional intermolecular hopping through short π–π stacking bridges.41,42
Conclusions
In summary, four conjugated polymers based on benzothiadiazole–quarterthiophene with different vinyl ratios were synthesized. The mobility of the four polymers exhibited progressive enhancement with increasing vinyl ratios, and a relatively high hole mobility of up to 0.36 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved. However, their crystallinities exhibit gradual reductions after an initial slight enhancement at first. The principle behind such regulation is that the raised ratio of the vinyl linker would amplify the probability of its conformational isomerization nature, which can cause a lowered crystallinity in the solid state, resulting in an impaired inter-chain charge transport, but at the same time the enhanced intra-chain charge transport from the extra vinyl linkers might overcome such a negative effect, creating an improved apparent mobility. Alternatively, this work could bring new ideas in designing high performance materials for OFETs. Further research in this vein deserves attention.
Experimental
OFET device fabrication
Bottom-gate/bottom-contact FETs were fabricated. A heavily doped n-type Si wafer and a layer of dry oxidized SiO2 (300 nm, with roughness lower than 0.1 nm and capacitance of 11 nF cm−2) were used as a gate electrode and gate dielectric layer, respectively. The drain–source (D–S) gold contacts were fabricated by photolithography. The substrates were first cleaned by sonication in acetone and water for 5.0 min and immersed in piranha solution (2:1 mixture of sulfuric acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide) for 30 min. This was followed by rinsing with deionized water and isopropyl alcohol several times, and it was blow-dried with nitrogen. Then, the surface was modified with n-octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS). After that, the substrates were cleaned in n-hexane, CHCl3, and isopropyl alcohol. The films of the four polymers were fabricated by spin-coating with their o-dichlorobenzene solutions (5.0 mg mL−1) at 2000 rpm. The annealing process was carried out in vacuum for 1.0 h at certain temperatures.
The field-effect characteristics of the devices were measured with a Keithley 4200 SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer under ambient conditions. The mobility of the OFETs in the saturation region was extracted from the following equation:  where IDS is the drain electrode collected current; L (50 μm) and W (1440 μm) are the channel length and width, respectively; μ is the mobility of the device; Ci (11 nF cm−2) is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer; VG is the gate voltage, VT is the threshold voltage, the VT of the device was determined by extrapolating the (IDS,sat)1/2vs. VG plot to IDS = 0.

The detailed route is as follow: compound 1 (203 mg, 0.2 mmol) and 5,5′-bis-(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (98 mg, 0.2 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of toluene, stirred and purged three times by vacuum/argon cycling. Then Pd2(dba)3 (1.83 mg, 2 mol%) and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (1.83 mg, 6 mol%) were added into the reaction mixture in a liquid nitrogen bath and purged three times to remove oxygen from the catalyst and ligands. The reaction solution was stirred at 110 °C for 48 h. The crude product was poured into methanol. The precipitate was filtered. The solid was extracted by Soxhlet with acetone and hexane, then the product was extracted with chloroform, and the chloroform was then removed under reduced pressure to provide a black solid (170 mg, 83%). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.71 (br, 4H), 6.87 (br, 4H), 2.74 (br, 4H), 1.79 (br, 2H), 1.30 (br, 52H), 0.88 (br, 12H).
