    , Accepted 12th August 2022First published on 24th August 2022AbstractDue to the high sodium ion conductivity, sodium super ionic conductors (NASICONs) are among the most promising candidates as solid electrolytes in solid state batteries and have therefore gained enormous attention in recent years. Previous experimental and computational investigations show excellent sodium ion conductivity for Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 with x = 2–2.5. In order to elucidate the conductivity maximum at high substitution levels, we investigate the influence of the cation environment on the site energies of sodium ions and the correlated migration using density functional theory. The results reveal that the site energy strongly depends on electrostatic effects. In addition, an increasing fraction of sodium and silicon ions enhances the correlated migration due to the increasing coulombic repulsion of sodium ions and opening of the bottleneck along the migration path. Based on the results, we generate an energy model to predict configurational and migration energy in subsequent Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. We show that sodium ions are trapped due to introduced silicon ions but percolate in the system for x≥2.0, which greatly increases the ionic conductivity.
1. Introduction
Clean and sustainable energy is becoming increasingly important as the extensive use of fossil fuels has raised concerns in terms of resource limitations and environmental impact.1–3 However, the supply of renewable energies, such as wind and solar power, is not adjustable and there is a large gap between production and demand. Large-scale energy storage and conversion devices are required to integrate renewable energies smoothly into the electrical grid and expand sustainable energy supply.4 Therefore, it is crucial to develop and improve reliable electrochemical energy storage (EES) technologies. In particular, batteries provide high energy density and conversion efficiency combined with long cycle life as well as low maintenance.5,6
One of the most established storage devices are lithium-ion batteries with high energy densities and output voltage.7 Nevertheless, the availability of resources leads to concern about its cost development.8–11 Sodium is a promising alternative due to its unlimited abundance and low cost as well as its low redox potential that is only 0.3 V above that of lithium. Admittedly, sodium is larger and heavier than lithium leading to lower energy density.11–16 Nevertheless, sodium-ion batteries can be an alternative to lithium-ion batteries where energy density requirements are less demanding, such as stationary EES systems.17–20
The efficiency of electrochemical devices depends crucially on the ionic conductivity of the applied electrolyte. Ceramic electrolytes are promising alternatives to conventional liquid electrolytes due to their high thermal stability and mechanical strength as well as wide electrochemical window. Furthermore, they can potentially enable both high energy and power density of batteries. Due to the numerous advantages, sodium based all-solid-state batteries receive increasing attention.21–29 However, not only the interfacial compatibility between electrolytes and electrode materials could be poor but also the ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes, which depends on the structure and composition poses a major challenge.21,24,26–31
NASICON (Na+ superionic conductor) materials are attracting considerable attention within the group of ceramic electrolytes since the observation of fast sodium ionic conductivity in Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3).28,31–33 The flexible framework allows a great compositional diversity that leads to many possible applications.31,34,35 Depending on the composition and temperature, the ionic conductivity of NASICON materials varies by several orders of magnitude.28,31 An extensive literature study of doped NaxM2SixP3−xO12 NASICONs by Guin et al. shows that materials exhibit highest conductivities when containing 3–3.5 sodium ions per formula unit, M cation with an ionic radius close to r = 0.72 Å as well as silicon ions substituting phosphorous ions.35 Ma et al. reported one of the highest total conductivities of 5 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature for Na3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12.36
1.1 Structure
At room temperature, Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 crystalizes in the rhombohedral phase (Rc), but in the compositional range of 1.8 ≤ x ≤ 2.2 a monoclinic distortion (C2/c) occurs. The low-temperature monoclinic structure undergoes a second order phase transition to rhombohedral symmetry at around 150 °C.32,36–45 Both structures consist of a framework of corner sharing PO4 tetrahedra and ZrO6 octahedra with sodium ion sites filling the cavities (Fig. 1). In the rhombohedral structure, there are two different sodium sites, the Na1 (6b) and Na2 (18e) site, whereas in the monoclinic structure there are the Na1 (4d), Na2 (4e) and Na3 (8f) sites.32,40,42,46–48 In the structure with x = 0 all sodium ions occupy the energetically more favorable Na1 positions.46,49–51 With increasing x the phosphorus ions get substituted by silicon ions and the overall charge is maintained by an increasing amount of sodium ions. In the fully substituted structure with x = 3, all sodium sites are occupied, as shown in Fig. 1. Additionally, transient mid-Na sites located between Na1 and Na2 sites are reported in structures with intermediate Na contents.43,49,51–54 Coulombic forces between sodium ions increase with x, which leads to a shift of some Na1 ions to mid-Na positions towards unoccupied Na2 sites. The occupation of mid-Na sites excludes the occupation of adjacent Na1 and Na2 sites. For that reason, the occupation of mid-Na sites tends to zero in structures above x = 2 since there are no unoccupied Na2 sites.43,49,51,52 For sake of simplicity, we focus on the occupation of the equilibrium Na1 and Na2 sites in this work.

1.2 Migration
The excellent ionic conductivity of NASICON materials is attributed to the three-dimensional framework of the structure with multiple sodium positions that provides high mobility of the charge carriers.32,33 The pioneering work of Hong and Goodenough et al. and following experimental32,33,47,48,55 as well as computational51–53,56 studies show that the sodium ions migrate via Na1 and Na2/Na3 sites rather than solely Na2/Na3 sites. As suggested by lower energy barriers, the concerted migration mechanism which involves the interstitialcy-like correlated migration of sodium ions on regular lattice sites (Na2/Na3–Na1–Na2/Na3) is preferred over single ion migration. During the correlated migration, the potential energy is transferred from ions at energetically higher Na2/Na3 sites to ions at energetically lower Na1 sites leading to a reduction of the migration energy barrier.52,53,57,58 Coulomb repulsion between the mobile ions pushes one ion to a neighboring site and causes another pushing-out event. Bottlenecks formed by ZrO6 octahedral and PO4 tetrahedral edges determine the migration energy.28,45,48,51,53–55 The high conductivity of compositions with x = 2–2.5 is not only attributed to the high concentration of mobile charge carriers, but also to the widening of the bottleneck that promotes the ion mobility.28,32,40,45,47,54 Furthermore, increasing sodium ion concentration enhances the correlated migration by increasing sodium–sodium coulombic repulsions.49,52 This type of collective migration appears also in fast lithium ion conductors, such as in NASICON-,59,60 LISICON-61,62 and garnet63–65 type structures.
The understanding of ionic motion is essential to improve the conductivity of solids. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and computational simulation techniques enable investigations of sodium ion migration in NASICON structures on multi-scale level as demonstrated in the past.51–53,56,66–70 Here, we studied the sodium ion migration and conductivity in the NASICON structure with composition Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation. We investigated the different sodium sites and the influence of the cation arrangement on the sodium site energies. In addition, we investigated the migration energy of mobile sodium ions regarding different pathways and compositions. Finally, we applied the ab initio results in subsequent KMC simulations allowing the investigation of ionic conductivity in large systems. Thus, the macroscopic sodium ion conductivity is linked to the local ionic environment and different migration pathways and energies. Our study reveals that not only the increasing amount of charge carriers and coulombic sodium–sodium repulsion as well as opening of the bottleneck of migration pathway enhances the ionic conductivity but also trapping and percolation effects of the charge carriers due to introduced silicon ions must be taken into account.
2. Method and model
2.1 Density functional theory

General computational setup. 
Optimization of monoclinic and rhombohedral structures and calculations of sodium ion migration within these structures were performed by Kohn-Sham DFT71,72 using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP).73–76 The exchange correlation contribution was described by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) parametrized by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBEsol).77 Plane waves with energy cut-offs of 500 eV for constant pressure and 400 eV for constant volume calculations were used and the projector augmented wave (PAW) method was applied.78 After optimization of the cell parameters, the volume was kept fixed in subsequent calculations. The convergence criteria of ionic and electronic relaxation were set to 0.01 eV Å−1 and 10−4 eV, respectively. A k-point mesh centered at the gamma point according to Monkhorst and Pack scheme was used to sample the Brillouin zone.79 For calculations of conventional cells a 2 × 2 × 2 mesh and for calculation of supercells a 1 × 1 × 1 mesh was chosen. The 2p63s1 electrons of sodium, the 4s24p64d25s2 electrons of zirconium, the 3s23p2 of silicon, the 3s23p3 electrons of phosphorous and the 2s22p4 electrons of oxygen were considered as valence electrons.


Configurational energies. 
Optimization of volume and lattice parameters was performed using conventional unit cells containing up to 126 atoms. The influence of the cation arrangement on configurational energy was investigated in cubic supercells with up to 168 atoms built from the primitive cell with optimized volume and lattice parameters using the following rotation matrices. If necessary, a homogeneous background charge was introduced to compensate the defect charge.  


Migration energies. 
The concerted migration of two sodium ions as well as the single ion migration was calculated in structures with x = 0, 1, 2, 3. In the case of the unsubstituted system with composition Na1Zr2P3O12 (x = 0), one additional sodium ion was introduced into the cell, while in the case of fully substituted system with composition Na4Zr2Si3O12 (x = 3), one vacancy was created by removing one sodium ion. The resulting defect charge of +1 in unsubstituted and −1 in fully substituted system was compensated by introducing a uniform background charge to maintain the charge neutrality. A distinction was made between three different migration pathways depending on their angle of about 80°, 90° and 180°. The minimum energy paths (MEP) of sodium ion migration in supercells were calculated by the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method with up to five interpolated images.80

2.2 KMC simulation
KMC methods allow the simulation of ionic conductivity of systems with different composition and at various temperatures.81 KMC simulations were performed with the MOCASSIN program using the null-event algorithm.82,83 The transport of ions is described by the activation barrier Emig that, according to transition state theory, depends on the energy of initial, transition and final state. The energies of the initial and final states depend on the local ionic configuration. As the calculation of the exact energy of all possible configurations by DFT exceeds the computational limit, the configurational energies are described by a pair interaction model. The approximation includes the number of pair interactions Ndij of the cations i and j at distance d and the corresponding interaction energies εdij without considering any many-body interactions. (1)The activation barrier Emig of the migration depends on both the local environment and the migration pathway. Therefore, a linearized interpolation is used to describe the activation barrier Emig including the configurational energy difference of initial state Econf,i and final state Econf,f and the migration energy Emig,0 which depends on the migration direction.84 (2)The pair interaction energies εdij as well as the migration energies Emig,0 were extracted from the DFT calculations as described before.
Simulations were conducted in 10 × 10 × 10 supercells of Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 with x = 0.2–2.8 in a temperature range of T = 300–500 K. Phosphorus, silicon and sodium ions were randomly distributed and only the sodium ions were considered to be mobile.
The ionic conductivity σi of a species i is calculated from the species charge qi, concentration ci and mobility ui. Based on linear response theory, the mobility ui is described by the averaged ensemble displacement 〈i〉, electric field modulus |E| and time t when electric field with strength n is applied.85 In this study, an electric field with n = 107 V m−1 was applied which ensures the independence of conductivity from the applied field (Fig. S1, ESI†). (3)The event time step Δt is described as a function of number of sites of mobile species in the lattice Nsite, the average number of jump possibilities per site 〈NJump〉 and the attempt frequency of ν0 = 1013 s−1.
3. Results
3.1 Structure analysis
The volume and cell shape of conventional cells of Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 (x = 0–3) were optimized for various compositions and configurations. With increasing x the amount of silicon ions and sodium ions increases. For both, the monoclinic and rhombohedral structures, the cell volume expands with x as shown in Fig. 2. This can be explained by the substitution of phosphorus ions by larger silicon ions (rSi4+ = 0.26 Å; rP5+ = 0.17 Å) and the simultaneous increase of sodium ion concentration.86 The trend is in agreement with experimental data except for x > 2 in the rhombohedral structure where the experiments shows a decrease of the volume.32,50 However, the computed increase for x > 2 is rather small. Furthermore, the computed and experimentally determined cell parameters are in good agreement.32,40,49–51,87 The decrease of the c parameter, explained in earlier studies by SiO4/PO4 tetrahedra disorder, is reproduced for x > 2 in the rhombohedral structure.49,88 In addition, calculated bond distances between the cations and oxygen ions are in accordance with experimentally determined values (Tables S1–S4, ESI†).32,40,70

3.2 Configurational energy
In the Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 structures with x = 0 and x = 3 the P5+/Si4+ P/Si sites are exclusively occupied by phosphorous or silicon, respectively, and thus only the distribution of the sodium ions affects the configurational energy. In contrast, different distributions of phosphorous and silicon ions in x = 1 and x = 2 have an additional impact on the configurational energy.

Phosphorus and silicon distribution. 
Supercells with different phosphorus and silicon distributions were investigated to identify low energy configurations. Five different configurations with increasing clustering of P5+ as well as Si4+ cations but equal arrangement of sodium ions were calculated. Fig. 3 shows the energy of the configurations depending on the number of silicon–phosphorus pairs in distance of up to 5.1 Å. The energy of both the monoclinic and rhombohedral phase decreases with increasing number of silicon–phosphorus pairs. Thus, a homogeneous distribution of phosphorus and silicon ions is more favorable rather than clustering in accordance with previous studies.41,68 The finding could be explained by Coulomb repulsion of the higher charged P5+ ions and steric hindrance of the larger Si4+ ions. In addition, clustering is accompanied by a slight distortion of the ionic positions, probably due to the unbalanced ionic interactions and the high level of strain in the crystal system.

Key: Na1 (yellow), Na2 (light green), PO4 tetrahedron (purple), SiO4 tetrahedron (blue). 


Sodium distribution. 
The energetic differences of the Na1, Na2 and Na3 sites were investigated in the monoclinic structure with composition NaZr2P3O12 (x = 0) by shifting up to three sodium ions from the Na1 to the Na2/Na3 position resulting in the corresponding number of Na1 vacancies (VNa1). Fig. 4 shows the averaged energy of structures with different sodium ion arrangement. The energy increases linearly by about 0.7 eV for each VNa1. No differences between Na2 and Na3 sites are found except for the case with three VNa1 where the lattice shows significant distortion. Consequently, the Na2 and Na3 sites can be considered as energetically equivalent.

In addition, rhombohedral structures with composition Na4Zr2Si3O12 (x = 3) and one VNa were investigated. In accordance with the previous results VNa1 is energetically less favorable than VNa2 by 0.21 eV. There are six P5+ ions in second Nearest Neighbor (NN) distance to Na1 site while there are three P5+ ions in 1NN distance and two P5+ ions in 2NN distance to Na2 sites. The more favorable occupation of Na1 sites can thus be explained by less electrostatic repulsion with adjacent phosphorus ions. Based on these results, only cells with fully occupied Na1 sublattice are considered and the Na1 sites will not be analyzed in more detail in the following.


Energy model. 
Generally, the configurational energy depends on the distribution of the P5+/Si4+ ions and occupation of Na2/Na3 sites. To describe the influence of the local cation occupation on the energy of each sodium site, a pair interaction model was created. According to eqn (4), the model includes the number of sodium–sodium pairs NNa and sodium-silicon pairs NSi as well as the corresponding interaction energies ENa and ESi. In this way, a model is set up that is as simple as possible in order to limit the computational demand and still ensures physical interpretability as already successfully shown in the past for other crystalline systems.89–91 (4)Sodium–cation pairs in a distance of up to 5.1 Å were taken into account. The neighboring ion positions and corresponding distances to Na2/Na3 sites are illustrated in Fig. 5. There are no differences between the monoclinic and rhombohedral structure regarding the number of neighbors and their distances in each shell. The Na2/Na3 sites are surrounded by two Na1 ions in 1NN position as well as ten Na2/Na3 in 2NN position. In addition, the Na2/Na3 sites are surrounded by three P/Si ions in 1NN and two in 2NN position.

Since the Na1 sites are always fully occupied, only pair interactions of sodium ions in 2NN distance have to be considered when determining the configurational energy. Table 1 shows the sodium–cation pair interaction energies obtained by multiple linear regression according to eqn (4), taking into account a total of 754 different configurations. Neighboring sodium ions increase the sodium site energy while neighboring silicon ions decrease the energy. Therefore, electrostatic, and steric repulsion of sodium ions seem to have an unfavorable effect onto the configurational energy. Negative interaction energies for EiSi suggest that sodium ions prefer positions close to silicon ions as could be expected by the less positive charge of Si4+ compared to P5+. There are no energy differences between monoclinic and rhombohedral structure due to identical distances between the ions.

The configurational energies obtained by the pair interaction model and calculated with DFT are compared in Fig. 6. The configurational energy increases with x due to the repulsion among the increasing number of sodium ions. Despite the deviations from the perfect fit to the DFT data, the model represents the correct trends regarding the configurational energy and is considered in subsequent KMC simulations.

3.3 Migration energy
Single ion jumps according to an interstitial mechanism are not considered in detail, since calculations in cells with x = 0, 1, 3 show high migration energies of Emig,0 = 2–3 eV. Only the correlated migration of sodium ions are investigated in cells with composition Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 (x = 0, 1, 2, 3) for different cation configurations. During the migration process, one sodium ion moves from a Na2/Na3 site towards the neighboring occupied Na1 site and pushes this sodium ion to another neighboring unoccupied Na2/Na3 site. The sodium ions jump through bottlenecks, which are each formed by three oxygen ions of one SiO4/PO4 tetrahedron and one ZrO6 octahedron as illustrated in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  Correlated migration mechanism of sodium ions with highlighted bottleneck of the migration pathway. Key: Na1 (yellow), Na2 (light green), O (red), ZrO6 octahedron (blue), SiO4/PO4 tetrahedron (purple). 
The three different migration pathways, defined by their angle of about 80°, 90° and 180°, are shown in Fig. 8. The migration of sodium ions is possible in a, b and c direction due to the 3D framework of the structure. At one central Na1 position, there are in total three possible pathways in 180° direction and six possible pathways in each 90° and 80° direction.

In the compositions with x = 0 and x = 3 there are no local variations of the cation occupation, and the migration barrier only depends on the migration angle. Energy profiles of the different migration paths in rhombohedral structures are shown in Fig. 9. No significant differences between the monoclinic and rhombohedral structure were found. The results are in agreement with the recent findings of Zou et al.53 for 180° and 90° in composition x = 0.
 Fig. 9  Energy profiles of different migration pathways in 80°, 90° and 180° in rhombohedral structure with composition Na3+xZr2Si2+xP1−xO12 with x = 0 (a–c) and x = 3 (d–f). 
The local minimum along the 180° migration path in the structure with x = 3 corresponds to the mid-Na site suggesting that this site occurs due to high sodium content and resulting coulombic repulsion.43,49,51–54
The migration energy decreases with increasing angle of pathway due to less steric hindrance of the migrating sodium ions. In addition, the alignment of the sodium ions migrating in 180° direction, which repel one another, may promote the correlated migration. The energy differences between the three distinct pathways are larger in structures with x = 0 than with x = 3. In the structure with x = 0 there are no sodium ions adjacent to the migration pathway which could sustain the correlated migration in 80° and 90° direction due to additional coulombic repulsion. For this reason, the 180° migration may be particularly favored, due to the alignment of the sodium ions along the migration direction, as described above. In contrast, all sodium sites are occupied in the structure with x = 3. In this case, the migration energies of the different pathways are similar due to similarly strong coulombic repulsion of neighboring sodium ions. Consequently, the change in energy x = 0 to x = 3 is most pronounced for the 80° pathways and least for the 180° pathways.
Furthermore, the migration energy decreases with increasing substitution level. Increasing sodium ion concentration leads to the increase of electrostatic sodium–sodium repulsion, which facilitates the correlated migration mechanism. Investigations of the structural changes during the sodium ion migration show that the sizes of the bottlenecks of the three different pathways do not differ significantly. However, the area of the bottlenecks is smaller in structures with x = 0 compared to structures with x = 3 (Fig. S2, ESI†). With increasing substitution level, phosphorus ions are replaced by larger silicon ions and the concentration of sodium ions increases leading to a larger cell volume and thus to a larger area of the bottleneck. The larger bottleneck facilitates the migration of the ions and thus reduces the energy barrier. These results agree with previous studies which suggest that sodium ion diffusion increases with opening of the bottleneck.40,42,47,54,88
For structures with composition x = 1 and x = 2 and different cation configurations, multiple migration pathways were investigated. The migration energies Emig,0 were extracted from the energy profiles of various configurations according to eqn (2). Shown in Fig. 10, the migration energies differ because of the different local cation environments of the pathways and structural distortions (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†). Although the calculated migration energies scatter widely, the averaged values of 80° and 90° migration pathway are in very good agreement with the interpolated values between those of x = 0 and x = 3. For 180° migration, the average values for x = 1 and x = 2 are higher than the interpolated values, which might be due to distortion in different local environments. However, it should be noted that the range of values calculated for these compositions is large.
 Fig. 10  Migration energies Emig,0 of pathway in 80° (green), 90° (blue) and 180° (purple) in dependence of substitution level x. Interpolation between migration energies for Na3+xZr2Si2+xP1−xO12 with x = 0 and x = 3 as well as range between minimum and maximum values of migration energies for x = 1 and x = 2 is shown. 
In summary, the decrease in the migration energy with x can be explained by the increase of sodium ion concentration, which increases the Coulomb repulsion and activates more correlated jumps. In addition, the framework expands, enlarging the bottlenecks of the pathway, resulting in less structural rearrangement during sodium ion migration. Our results are in accordance with the recent study of Zou et al. that distinguishes between 90° and 180° migration in rhombohedral structure53 and investigate 180° migration in monoclinic structure.54
3.4 KMC simulations
Based on the derived energy model, KMC simulations were performed to investigate the influence of the composition, local site energies and migration pathway on the ionic conductivity in Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12. Four different simulation models were applied to differentiate the effect of different energy contributions. Although the energy model is simple and we applied a fixed volume and attempt frequency, the simulations are expected to reveal the origin of the conductivity maximum at high sodium content that was observed in previous studies. In model 1 no pair interaction energy is considered whereas in model 2–4 the pair interaction model according to eqn (4) is applied. Furthermore, the definition of the migration energy Emig,0 differs in the models:
Model 1 & 2: Single Emig,0 for all compositions and migration pathways set to the average energy of the 180° migration for x = 0 and x = 3.
Model 3: Individual Emig,0 for different migration pathways corresponding to the averages of x = 0 and x = 3.
Model 4: Emig,0 depends on the migration pathway and the composition according to Fig. 10.
In the following, the results of simulations in the rhombohedral structure are shown as the structure exists in a wider range of compositions and temperatures. Since the conductivity is anisotropic, we show the averaged conductivities from simulations with an electric field in x-, y- and z-direction and compare these values with experimental values of polycrystals. In addition, we discuss the corresponding activation energies and we analyze the energy distribution of the jumps in each direction.

Fig. 11 depicts the conductivity as a function of the composition for all simulation models. The results of model 1 (Fig. 11(a)) show the conductivity maximum at x = 1.5 where half of the Na2/Na3 sites are occupied leading to the maximum number of jump possibilities. The partial conductivities resulting from migration in 80°, 90° and 180° direction are the same and thus contribute equally to the total conductivity (Fig. S5(a–c), ESI†).
 Fig. 11  Conductivity σ of rhombohedral structure in dependence of substitution level x obtained from simulations using model 1–4 (a–d). For comparison, experimentally determined conductivities obtained at 573 K are shown (e).33,37,40,46 
The results of model 2 (Fig. 11(b)) show similar behavior at temperatures above 450 K. At lower temperatures, various effects determine the conductivity due the introduced pair interactions. As expected, the conductivity increases at small substitution levels (x < 0.5) due to the increase of sodium ions and decreases at high substitution levels (x < 2.8) due to an insufficient number of vacant sites. Between 1 ≤ x ≤ 2 the conductivity decreases slightly as sodium ions are trapped in low energy states next to silicon ions. However, the favorable ratio of occupied to unoccupied sodium ion positions leads to a local conductivity maximum at x = 1.5. The partial conductivities resulting from 80°, 90° and 180° migration are similar for very low and high x (Fig. S5(d–f), ESI†). However, in compositions with 1 ≤ x ≤ 2 the partial conductivity of 180° migration decreases sharply at low temperature due to very small number of succeeded jumps which will be discussed in more detail below.
The results of model 3 (Fig. 11(c)) are similar to those of model 2 and can be explained accordingly. However, the absolute conductivities are lower, since 80° and 90° migration possess higher energy barriers. Since the migration energy decreases with increasing angle of pathway, the partial conductivities resulting from 180° migration are the highest. Conductivities from 90° migration are negligible only at low temperatures, while those resulting from 80° migration are negligible at all temperatures (Fig. S5(g–i), ESI†).
In model 4 (Fig. 11(d)), the conductivity maximum shifts to x = 2.5–2.8. Here, the migration energy decreases with increasing angle of pathway and substitution level and leads to high conductivity at high x. However, at very high values of x the conductivity decreases due to low amount of vacant sodium positions, as seen in the previous results. The slight decrease in conductivity at small substitution level and low temperatures can again be explained by trapping effects of silicon ions. However, the impact of sodium ion trapping is less pronounced compared to the variation of the migration energy. As the previous results show, the partial conductivity resulting from 180° is the highest and from 80° and 90° migration negligible for very low substitution level (Fig. S5(j–l), ESI†). Between 1 ≤ x ≤ 2 the partial conductivities converge due to trapping effects of sodium ions at low temperature. With increasing x, the partial conductivities from 90° and 180° migration increase sharply. While in case of 180° migration mainly the percolation effects influence the conductivity, in case of 90° migration the strongly decreasing migration energy has decisive impact. The conductivity resulting from 80° migration is very low and increases only slightly with increasing x which can be explained by lower number of succeeded jumps, as discussed below.

Fig. 11(e) shows experimental values obtained at 573 K with a maximum at around x = 2.0, similar to the results for model 4.33,37,40,46 It is noted that the simulated values are about one order of magnitude higher than the experimental values, which could be due to the fixed attempt frequency and inaccuracies in the DFT derived energies. However, Ma et al. revealed that the total conductivity is underestimated in literature and reported high bulk conductivities of composition Na3+xZr2Si2+xP1−xO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) with a maximum of 1.5 × 10−2 S cm−1 for x = 2.4 at 25 °C which is similar to our results.36 In addition, the simulated conductivity maximum is shifted to higher values of x compared to the experiments. This is probably due to the fact that the energies were interpolated between the composition of Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 with x = 0 and x = 3 and thus the migration barriers for large values of x are underestimated. Nevertheless, the simulations show the trend of the shift of the maximum to higher x values due to the changes in the migration barrier as well as percolation of the sodium ions and contribute to further explanation of existing results in literature.
The activation energies EA are determined by an Arrhenius plot (Fig. S6, ESI†). For model 1 the value is EA = 0.17 eV according to constant the constant Emig,0 without pair interactions. Total activation energies obtained for models 2–4 are shown in Fig. 12(a) and the individual contributions from 80°, 90° and 180° migration are given in Fig. 12(b–d).
 Fig. 12  Total (a) and partial activation energies of 80° (green), 90° (blue) and 180° (purple) migration (b–d) of Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 (x = 0.2–2.8) obtained from Arrhenius plot for models 2–4. Comparison of activation energies of model 4 with experiments33,37,38,40 and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations53 (e). 
In model 2, the partial activation energies for the migration of different directions are similar as Emig,0 is independent of the angle. The activation energy first increases and then decreases as different local ionic environments lead to states of various energies. At low substitution levels (x < 1), sodium ions are trapped in low energy states resulting in an increase of EA with maximum between 1 ≤ x ≤ 2. At high substitution levels (x > 2), the percolation of sodium ions between favorable silicon rich positions leads again to a decrease of the activation energy.
The results of model 3 show a similar trend, but the activation energies are higher since the partial activation energies increases with decreasing angle according to the different Emig,0. Between 1 ≤ x ≤ 2, the activation energies of 90° and 180° migration are similar. In this case, the trapping of the sodium ions influences the activation energy more than the lower migration energy.
The maximum of EA for model 4 is shifted to lower substitution levels. In the case of 180° migration, the activation energy reaches a maximum at x = 1 due to sodium ion trapping. The activation energy of 80° and 90° decreases with increasing x due to sharply decreasing values of Emig,0. Due to trapping effects, in all cases the migration energy decreases less sharply for 1 ≤ x ≤ 2 compared to higher x when sodium ions percolate in the system.
For a more detailed analysis of the impact of substitution and pathway on the activation energy, the energy-dependent number of attempted and succeeded jumps in all directions are considered (Fig. S7–S9, ESI†). As there are no differences in Emig,0 for different angles in model 2, the jump histograms of 80°, 90° and 180° direction are equal. The histograms can be classified in three groups according to the compositions with equal or similar ratio of the amount of charge carriers and vacant positions. The composition with (i) x = 0.2 and 2.8, (ii) x = 0.5 and 2.5, (iii) x = 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 show identical energy distribution of the jumps and thus identical activation energies, as observed in Fig. 12. With a more heterogeneous energy landscape towards x = 1.5 the range of energies is broadened and shifted to higher values. The number of succeeded jumps in each direction show a minimum at x = 1.5 due to sodium ion trapping. Since the number of succeeded jumps in 180° direction is very low at 1 ≤ x ≤ 2, the partial conductivity decreases strongly in this range compared to partial conductivity resulting from 80° and 90° migration. These results support the previous explanations concerning the course of the activation energy and the conductivity at low temperatures.
The trends of model 3 are similar but with 80° and 90° jumps shifted to higher energies. Therefore, at very low and high x, mostly 180° jumps succeed thus determining the activation energy. However, with x approaching 1.5 the number of succeeded jumps in 180° direction decreases the most, and thus the influence of 90° and 180° jumps on activation energy is similar. The number of succeeded jumps in 80° direction is very small which explains the low conductivity and insignificant influence on activation energy.
In model 4, attempted jumps appear over a wider range of energies according to interpolated migration energies (compare Fig. 10). At low substitution levels, the migration energies of different pathways increase strongly with smaller angle. Thus, the number of succeeded high energy jumps in 80° and 90° direction is negligible which explains the low partial conductivity and small influence on total activation energy. The number of succeeded jumps in 180° direction show a minimum at x = 1.0 due to trapping of sodium ions. For 1.0 < x < 2.0, the number of succeeded jumps in all directions increases slightly even though sodium ions are trapped as the migration energies decrease. When x > 2.0, the number of succeeded jumps increases strongly due to additional percolation effects of sodium ions. At high substitution levels, the migration energies of 90° and 180° converge and therefore jumps appear at similar energies. Since there are twice as many jump possibilities in 90° direction, the number of succeeded jumps is higher compared to those of 180°. The number of succeeded jumps in 80° is the lowest due to higher energies and thus the partial conductivity and influence on total activation energy.

Fig. 12(e) shows the comparison of activation energies obtained from simulation 4 with literature values. The determined activation energies are in good agreement with the results obtained from a.c. conductivity measurements,33,37,38,40 especially with the findings of Goodenough et al.,33 and obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.53 Nevertheless, it is apparent that the literature values fluctuate strongly and a direct comparison is not straightforward.
4. Conclusion
We investigated the sodium ion transport in the rhombohedral and monoclinic structure of composition Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 using DFT calculations and KMC simulations. DFT calculations reveal that the sodium site energy strongly depends on electrostatic interactions with the adjacent cations. Lower sodium and phosphorus content in local environment leads to lower sodium site energy. We constructed a pair interaction model to generalize these findings. Although the configurational energies cannot be described precisely with the model, the physical interpretability is ensured. Furthermore, our calculations reveal that there are three different pathways for correlated sodium ion migration, defined by their angle, with the 180° path being most favorable. The migration energies decrease with increasing angle of pathway and substitution levels due to lower steric hindrance and increasing Coulomb repulsion.
The DFT results were applied in subsequent KMC simulations that show highest conductivity at x = 2.5–2.8 when directional and compositional dependence of migration energy is considered. Our results reveal further explanations of the behavior and dependence of ionic conductivity in NASICON materials. The maximum of ionic conductivity cannot only be explained by increasing Coulomb repulsion, enlarging of the bottleneck and the direction of the migration pathway. Also, the percolation of sodium ions by adjusting the dopant content need to be considered in order to optimize the NASICON compositions.
