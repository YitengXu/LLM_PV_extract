Based on the positions of the spacer (π) and acceptor (A) in the polymers, a dodecyl chain (P2) and an octyloxy chain (P3), respectively, were introduced. Both chains were introduced to the spacer and acceptor of P4. The obtained polymers (P2–P4) were soluble in organic solvents such as chlorobenzene, THF and o-dichlorobenzene at room temperature. Also, the introduction of a dodecyl chain to the spacer reduced the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level (−5.5 to −5.56 eV) but increased the tilt angle (45.4–53.0°), which had prevented the main chain from π–π stacking. The orientation of the obtained polymers in thin films was confirmed by XRD measurement. P3 with only an octyloxy chain showed a face-on-rich structure with a π–π stacking distance of 3.7 Å compared to other polymers. The polymer solar cells were fabricated through a solution process, and showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.6%, with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 8.9 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.88 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 45.7%. With the introduction of poly[9,9-bis(6′-(diethanolamino)hexyl)fluorene] (PFN-OH), a PCE of 3.9% was confirmed.1 IntroductionOrganic electronic devices such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),1–5 organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs),6–10 and organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs)11–14 have been attracting attention owing to their easy manufacturing based on solution processing. As a result, solubility, oxidative stability, and high charge-carrier mobility have been important properties in active materials. Recently, OPVs have been gaining attention as the major research area because of the use of the enhanced molecular engineering technology of π-conjugated polymers. However, the low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPVs is a major obstacle. Therefore, in order to enhance the PCE, it is necessary to tune the optoelectronic properties of the photoactive material, i.e., the π-conjugated polymer. Methods of tuning the properties include (1) lowering the energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to achieve a high open-circuit voltage (Voc), (2) decreasing the bandgap to enlarge the absorption region, and (3) enhancing the molecular weight of the π-conjugated polymer.15Among the derivatives that lower the HOMO energy levels, the most common are fluorene derivatives.16,17 These derivatives also have good oxidation stability owing to the low HOMO energy level of fluorene.18,19 Moreover, because of the introduction of two side chains to the 9-position of fluorene, the poor solubility of π-conjugated polymers can be improved. A method to enlarge the absorption region by decreasing the bandgap involves the introduction of an electron-withdrawing acceptor unit into the main chain of donor–acceptor (D–A)-type polymers. Typical acceptor units that play such a role are 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) and di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT). There have been many studies on the improvement of OPV properties by introducing DTBT instead of BT. Compared to BT, DTBT can relieve steric hindrance between a donor and BT, thereby increasing the hole mobility. Therefore, the DTBT unit has been widely used as the active material in high-efficiency bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs).20,21 However, because of thiophene units in DTBT, it has a stronger stacking ability than BT. As a result, polymers synthesized with DTBT have low solubilities and low molecular weights.22,23 Therefore, many studies have focused on increasing the molecular weight by using derivatives in which the side chains are introduced to the low-solubility DTBT.23–31 You et al. reported the PBDT–DTBT series by taking bithiophene fused with a benzene moiety (BDT) as a donor and themodified DTBT as an acceptor, and the molecular weight and PCE increased over three times by introducing a side chain to the thiophene spacer.23 Li et al. synthesized D–π–A polymers with a poly(2,7-(9,9′-dioctylfluorene)-alt-5,5′-(4,7-di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)) (F-T-BT-T) structure. When the side chain was introduced to the thiophene spacer instead of BT, a higher increase in molecular weight (over 30 times, to 175 kDa) and a similar PCE (2.2%) were observed. However, the molecular weight of the polymer in which an alkoxy side chain was introduced to BT was low (77 kDa), whereas PCE was higher (3.1%) than the former.27 But, fluorene has two alkyl side chains connected to the C atom with a “sticking-out” configuration. Therefore, even though the substituted alkyl chain improved the solubility of polymers containing fluorene, it is difficult to form a two-dimensional π-stacking morphology, which thus limits close-packing and the charge-carrier mobility.18,32 McCulloch et al. proposed alkylidene fluorene instead of fluorene for close-packing because of the use of the -lidene functional group, which is sp2-hybridized. This functional group removes the sticking-out effect of the alkyl side chain. Therefore, it has been reported that the alkylidene fluorene homopolymer has a very low intermolecular distance (<0.4 nm) and is available for coplanar conformation. In addition, its HOMO level decreases and an efficient conjugation is enabled along the chain-length.18 However, this polymer has a wide bandgap (−2.5 eV), which is not sufficient to absorb the solar spectrum.Recently, Zhang et al. performed a study on the close-packing characteristics of polymers. They reported the synthesis of D–π–A-type close-packed polymers by taking DTBT as an acceptor and alkylidene fluorene28 and carbazole,33 instead of fluorene, as donors. In a separate study, Dai et al. concluded that the side chain of the donor polymer in D–π–A-type polymers plays an important role in controlling polymer crystallinity by regulating the main-chain stacking.32 In particular, EI-PFDTBT, to which sp2-hybridized alkylidene fluorene was introduced, revealed coplanar characteristics. In addition, a device that was spin-coated at 120 °C showed a PCE of 5.07%. However, a low PCE was found (1.53%) in a device that was fabricated at room temperature. Because of the low solubility of polymers, a high-temperature process could be required to form a pinhole- and particle-free uniform and smooth film.27,28,32In this study, D–π–A-type polymers with coplanar conformation, which can be processed at room temperature with high solubility, were synthesized. 9-(1′-Decylundecylidene)fluorene, which has good mobility and oxidative stability with low HOMO levels, was used as an electron donor (D). In addition, alkyl and alkoxy side chains were introduced to the spacer (π) and acceptor (A), respectively, and a poly[alkylidenefluorene-alt-di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole] (PAFDTBT) series was polymerized, as shown in Fig. 1. When the synthesized polymers were fabricated to PSCs at room temperature, a PCE of 3.6% was confirmed. Also, the results revealed a PCE of up to 3.9% by introducing a poly[9,9-bis(6′-(diethanolamino)hexyl)fluorene] (PFN-OH) layer. At 480 nm, 60% incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was demonstrated. Fig. 1  Chemical structures of P1–P4. 2 Results and discussion2.1 Polymer synthesisScheme 1 shows the general synthetic routes towards both monomers and polymers. In this study, 9-(1′-decylundecylidene)fluorene monomers (D1) were used as the donor and di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT, A1) was used as a strong acceptor. In addition, DTBT-adopted dodecyl and octyloxy chains were introduced, depending on the position. As shown in Scheme 1, derivatives with the dodecyl chain (A2) and the octyloxy chain (A3) were introduced to the thiophene spacer and benzothiadiazole, respectively. A4, with both side chains, was also synthesized. Using D1 and DTBT derivatives (A1–A4), D–π–A-type polymers (P1–P4) were synthesized through a palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction (Fig. 1). Polymerization was performed in 2 M aqueous potassium carbonate solution, using toluene as a solvent with Pd(PPh3)4(0) as a catalyst and Aliquat 336 as a surfactant at 100 °C for 48 h. Once the polymerization was completed, the samples were end-capped with bromobenzene and phenyl boronic acid. The polymer yields precipitated in methanol (P1–P4) were 65, 90, 80 and 80%, respectively. The obtained powders were again purified in a Soxhlet apparatus with methanol, acetone, and chloroform. Finally, the chloroform-soluble portion was re-precipitated in methanol. P1 was obtained as a dark violet powder, whereas P2, P3 and P4 were obtained as red powders. The polymers were all well soluble in tetrahydrofuran (THF), chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene at room temperature. The structures of the obtained polymers were confirmed by 1H NMR spectra (see in ESI†). It was also confirmed that the monomers in which the dodecyl and octyloxy chains were introduced to benzothiadiazole and the thiophene spacer, respectively, were successfully synthesized. Also, according to an analysis of the structure of the obtained polymers, P2 showed peaks at approximately 2.9–2.6 ppm, which come from the hydrogen bonded to the α-carbon of aromatic thiophene, and P3 showed peaks at 4.3–4.0 ppm and 2.9–2.6 ppm, which come from the hydrogen bonded to the α-carbon and β-carbon, respectively, of the oxygen in the side chain. In the case of P4, aliphatic protons of both P2 and P3 were observed. Scheme 1  Synthesis of monomers and polymers. Table 1 shows the results of the measurement of molecular weights of P1–P4. The polymers showed a narrow polydispersity index (PDI) distribution (1.60, 1.54, 2.07, and 1.87) with number-average molecular weights (Mn) of 4.7, 10.1, 17.7, and 8.7 kDa, respectively. P1 showed a low degree of polymerization with low solubility of the main chain during the polymerization. P4, similar to P1, also showed a low degree of polymerization despite having both side chains in the thiophene spacer and BT. However, in P2 and P3, both Mn and the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) were improved. In particular, P3 showed the highest degree of polymerization.

In addition, a similar increase in molecular weight was reported when 4-ethyl octyl was introduced at the 5,6-position of BT.23 However, the octyloxy chain introduced to BT gave higher molecular weights than the linear dodecyl chain introduced to the thiophene spacer of DTBT.2.2 XRD measurementFig. 2 shows the X-ray diffraction measurements of the film to analyze the ordered structure of P2–P4. According to a report by Liu et al., a strong diffraction peak was observed at 3.9° and 21.3° in EI-PFDTBT, which has a similar structure to P1. In addition, the distance between the main chains and the π–π stacking distance were reported to be 22.6 Å and 4.1 Å, respectively.32 In the out-of-plane of P2, a broad diffraction peak was prominently detected at 21.8° which indicates the formation of π–π stacking. According to a calculation based on Bragg's law (λ = 2dsin θ), a π–π stacking distance (dπ) of 4.1 Å was revealed. The diffraction pattern of P3 showed a sharp diffraction peak at 4.5°, which indicates the formation of a highly ordered (100) lamellar structure as an out-of-plane peak. The lamellar d-spacing (d1) was calculated to be 19.7 Å. In the (010) crystal plane related to π–π stacking, a broad diffraction peak was observed at 23.8°. The π–π stacking distance (dπ) of P3 was 3.7 Å. Zhang et al. reported that the XRD diffraction peak of PAFDTBT is 2θ = 4.9° (d1 = 17.9 Å) and 2θ = 21.4° (dπ = 4.1 Å). Accordingly, the π–π stacking distance (dπ) of P3 is smaller than that of PAFDTBT.28 In terms of the diffraction pattern of P4, a sharp diffraction peak at 3.3° and a lamellar d-spacing (d1) of 26.6 Å was observed. Moreover, in the (010) crystal plane associated with π–π stacking, a broad diffraction peak was detected at 19.9°, and a π–π stacking distance of 4.5 Å was observed. Therefore, the smallest π–π stacking distance and face-on-rich structure were found in P3. And, it can be estimated that an efficient charge transfer would occur in the perpendicular direction. In the case of P2 and P4, because of the dodecyl chain, an amorphous structure was found in P2, whereas an edge-on-rich structure was detected in P4. Fig. 2  X-ray diffraction patterns of polymers. 2.3 Optical and electrochemical propertiesFig. 3 shows the UV-visible spectra of all polymers in both solution and film. All polymers were measured at a concentration of 10 μg mL−1 in chloroform. All polymers showed two absorption bands. The results are summarized in Table 2. The maximum absorption peak (λmax) of P1 was 513 nm in solution and the absorption coefficient of P1 was calculated to be 2.6 × 104 M−1 cm−1. In the case of the P1 film state, the results were red-shifted to 30 nm (λmax = 543 nm) as compared to the solution. This was due to strong π–π stacking of polymers in the solid state. The absorption edge of P1 was 675 nm and the calculated optical bandgap was 1.84 eV, which is the lowest among all the synthesized polymers in this study. Therefore, P1 might undergo absorption in the broadest area of the visible region. In solution, λmax of P2 was 505 nm. Here, the absorption coefficient was 3.28 × 104 M−1 cm−1. As compared to the solution, a 21 nm red-shift (λmax = 526 nm) was observed in the film. The absorption edge of P2 was 639 nm, and the calculated optical bandgap was 1.94 eV. Moreover, the P2 absorption spectra were blue-shifted by 13 nm in solution and by 17 nm in film compared with P1. Therefore, anchoring the dodecyl side chain at the 4-position of a thiophene such as in P2 strengthens the electron donating characteristics. As a result, the absorption coefficient around λmax and the bandgap were increased, whereas π–π stacking tendency is decreased. The UV-visible spectra of P3 were similar to those of P1. P3 in solution had a λmax of 524 nm, and the absorption coefficient was 3.04 × 104 M−1 cm−1. As compared to the P3 solution, a 17 nm red-shift (λmax = 541 nm) was observed in the P3 film. The absorption edge of P3 was 643 nm and the calculated optical bandgap was 1.92 eV. These results are similar to the results of the study by Zhang et al.28 By introducing the alkoxy chain, the electron-withdrawing characteristics of the acceptor were weakened and the bandgap of P3 was increased compared to P1. Thus, the alkoxy chains are to make BT less electron-accepting. Comparing the UV-visible spectrum behaviours between P1 and P3, it was found that P3 was more red-shifted in solution, whereas P1 was more red-shifted in the film. Because the value of the red-shift difference from the solution to the solid state of P3 (17 nm) is greater than that of P1 (25 nm), the π–π stacking of P1 is stronger than that of P3. This phenomenon means that film aggregation in P3 is interrupted by the introduced octyloxy chain. As a result, P3 has a more unstable chain conformation than P1. Finally, λmax of P4 in solution was 343 nm and the absorption coefficient was calculated to be 5.94 × 104 M−1 cm−1, which is greater than the results found for P1–P3. In other words, the optical absorption is greater in P4. In the solid state a 3 nm red-shift (λmax = 346 nm) was observed compared with that of the solution. The absorption edge of P4 was 583 nm and the calculated optical bandgap was 2.12 eV. The UV-visible spectra of P4 were similar to those of P2. Here, the electron-donating characteristics and absorption behaviours in the short-wavelength regions were increased because of the dodecyl chain. These results indicate a further increase in the effect of a delocalized π–π* transition.34 As compared to P2, the P4 spectra in solution were blue-shifted. In addition, the value of red-shift difference from the solution to the solid state was the lowest (3 nm).

Also, the bandgaps of P2–P4 were increased by the introduced side chains because of decreasing electron-withdrawing characteristics. Especially, when a dodecyl chain is anchored at the spacer, the short wavelength absorption coefficient was enhanced because it gives electron donating characteristics to polymers. Even though all the polymers have the same structure as that of the main chain, the absorption behaviour differed depending on the position of the side chain. The results of the UV-visible spectra were consistent with those of previous studies that were blue-shifted by the introduced side chains to the spacer.27,29,30,34 However, a study reported by You et al. showed a red-shift resulting from the side chain at the 4-position of the spacer compared to that without side chains.23 Also, a blue-shift resulting from the introduction of a side chain to the BT core at the 5,6-position is observed.23,27 This result is due to chain conformation. But the UV-visible spectra of the P3 solution in this study were observed to be red-shifted compared to P1 solution. Therefore, the chain conformation of P3 is more stable than that of P1 due to the presence of alkoxy chains.To check the differences in energy levels as a function of side chains, cyclic voltammograms of the P1–P4 thin films were measured by using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium-hexafluorophosphate (TBAHFP) in acetonitrile solution, as shown in Fig. S2† and are summarized in Table 2. The dodecyl chain-less P1 and P3 showed oxidation onset potentials of +1.14 V and +1.10 V, respectively. The HOMO levels of P1 and P3 were similarly calculated to be −5.41 eV and +5.37 eV, respectively. Therefore, we confirmed that the octyloxy chain in P3 had little effect on the HOMO levels. As reported by Zhang et al., these results were similar to the HOMO level (−5.32 eV) of PAFDTBT.28 However, P2 and P4 with dodecyl chains have a greater number of delocalized π electrons. As a result, the oxidation onset potentials of the two polymers were +1.29 V and +1.23 V, respectively. In other words, the deeper HOMO levels of P2 and P4 (−5.56 and −5.50 eV, respectively) were calculated as compared to those of P1 and P3. Therefore, the HOMO levels of the polymers decreased because of the increased number of delocalized π-electrons of the alkyl chain. And these results are consistent with the results of previous studies that show reduced HOMO levels, similar to the results of UV-visible spectra.27,29,30 As compared to P1 and P2, the HOMO levels of P3 and P4 slightly increased because of an alkoxy chain which makes BT less electron-accepting. This result agrees well with that reported by Zhang et al. that the octyloxy chain has a minimal effect in controlling the HOMO levels.27 Hence, P2 has the lowest HOMO level, whereas P3 attains the highest HOMO level. P4 was influenced by both alkyl and alkoxy chains. However, as reported by You et al., the HOMO levels of polymers were increased by spacers with side chains, whereas those of polymers were decreased by BT with side chains.232.4 Computational studyTo have a better understanding of the electronic properties of the synthesized polymers, the molecular geometries and electron density distribution of states were simulated using density functional theory (DFT). The DFT was calculated using Gaussian 09 for the hybrid B3LYP correlation functional and split valence 6-31G(d) basis set. Oligomers, which have two repeat units, were selected as a calculation model. The calculated HOMO and LUMO orbitals are shown in Fig. 4. The HOMO orbitals were delocalized to the polymer main chain, whereas the LUMO orbitals were localized to the acceptor BT because of the structural characteristics of forming quinoid, non-bonding electron pair of nitrogen, and electron-withdrawing characteristics of sulphur.35 As measured in the cyclic voltammogram, the lowest HOMO level (−4.86 eV) was found in P2, whereas the highest HOMO level (−4.74 eV) was found in P3. In addition, both were influential in P4. Fig. 4  Calculated HOMO and LUMO orbitals of polymers. The dihedral angles between the two thienyl groups with central BT and alkylidene fluorene were measured. The results are shown in Fig. 4 and are summarized in Table 3. We then attempted to determine the steric hindrance resulting from the introduction of the side chains. In Fig. 4, the dihedral angles 1 of P1 and P3 were 24° and 26°, respectively. However, the dihedral angles 1 of P2 and P4, each with thiophene-bound dodecyl side chains, were almost twice those of P1 and P3, at 53° and 45.4°, respectively. Therefore, the alkyl chain at the 4-position is enhancing the steric hindrance. This steric hindrance essentially reduces π–π stacking among the polymers, which can reduce charge transport.23P3 and P4, which include alkoxy-chained BT, showed an increase in dihedral angles 2 and 3 because of the interaction between oxygen in the alkoxy chain and sulphur in the thiophene spacer.

Fig. 5(a) reveals the J–V curve of BHJ PSCs with and without a PFN-OH layer in P3 and P4, and Fig. 5(b) shows IPCE. The photovoltaic properties of all polymers were evaluated after fabricating PSC devices with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/BaF2/Ba/Al structure. All fabricated devices were encapsulated in a glove box. The J–V characteristics were measured in an ambient atmosphere with an active area of 4 mm2. The PV properties of the fabricated PSCs are listed in Table 4. In P1, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 2.7 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 28.4% were observed with a PCE of 0.55%. Excessive aggregation of P1 would lead to formation of polymers-only domains so large that excitons cannot reach a donor–acceptor interface.23 However, the side-chain-anchored polymers, P2–P4, showed improved PV properties as compared to P1. In addition, P2 revealed a high Voc of 0.92 V because of a lower HOMO level. However, the increased absorbance was not converted into a photocurrent because P2 overlapped with the absorption region of the PC71BM acceptor. As a result, the increase in Jsc was not significant (Jsc = 3.1 mA cm−2). Moreover, because of increased steric hindrance by the alkyl chain, FF somewhat decreased to become 27%. In P3, Voc and FF improved despite showing electro-optical properties similar to those of P1. In particular, the greatest increase in Jsc was found in P3, from 2.7 to 8.9 mA cm−2, an increase of 330%. As a result, PCE exhibited an increase of 3.6% because the dissociation of excitons became easier without an energy loss after the series resistance (Rs) reduced. With the other polymers, the greatest Voc was found in P4 (0.98 V), which had a low PCE of 1.5%. This result of P4 is because it failed to attain the optimum energy level after an increase in both bandgap and LUMO levels, despite an increase in Voc after the HOMO level became low. As compared to P2, the Jsc and FF of P4 improved by 51% and 17%, respectively. Fig. 5  (a) The J–V curve and (b) the IPCE curve of P3 and P4 with or without PFN-OH.

As a result, Voc and FF in P3 slightly increased and PCE increased up to 3.9%. Even though Voc decreased in P4, Jsc increased. In addition, PCE increased up to 1.7% in P4.Consequently, the energy level and steric hindrance changed, depending on the position of the side chain. As a result, in P2 and P4, which have low HOMO levels owing to the dodecyl chain, high Voc values (≥0.9 V) were detected. However, because of the steric hindrance, there was no remarkable change in Jsc or FF. In P3, the lowest Rs was obtained with the introduction of the planar conformation-enabled octyloxy chain.33 Furthermore, P3 showed a significant increase in the Jsc and FF. Fig. S4(b)† reveals that IPCE of all the polymers exhibited an absorbance of light at 300–700 nm. In particular, P3, which revealed the highest Jsc, exhibited an IPCE of 60% at 480 nm and a conversion rate of ≥50% with the absorbance of light at 420–520 nm. In the same wavelength region, P1 and P2 exhibited an IPCE of 25%, whereas P4 exhibited an IPCE of 40%.2.6 Morphology analysisThe morphology of the polymer/PC71BM-blend film was measured with atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the results are shown in Fig. 6. The dark-coloured and light-coloured areas correspond to PCBM domains and polymers, respectively. Polymer channels could not be formed in P1, P2, or P4. However, in P3, well-defined phase separation between the polymers and PC71BM occurred. In other words, channels were well formed among the polymers. These results are consistent with the high Jsc in P3. In addition, because the roughness of P3 is large as compared to P1 and P2, polymer rearrangement occurred. As a result, an ordered structure has become possible, which may be a factor in enhancing the efficiency of PSCs.38P4 has a large root mean square roughness (RMS) of 1.280 nm as compared to the rest of the polymers because of its high steric hindrance.

A mixture of 4,7-dibromo-5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazole (1.23 g), 2(4-dodecylthiophene-2-yl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (2.2 g), and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4) (0.13 g, 5 mol%) was dissolved in dry toluene (18 mL) and 2 M K2CO3 aqueous solution (3:2 in volume). The solution was refluxed for 48 h, then cooled and poured into water. The mixture was extracted twice with chloroform. The organic phases were combined, washed with brine, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the crude product was purified by column chromatography using chloroform–hexanes as the eluent (ratio 1:3) to afford the product as a green powder (0.5 g, 24%). δH (400 MHz; CDCl3; Me4Si): 8.31 (s, 2H); 7.08 (s, 2H); 4.09 (t, 4H, J = 8 Hz); 2.71 (t, 2H, J = 8 Hz); 1.93 (m, 4H); 1.72 (m, 4H); 1.44–1.32 (m, 60H); 0.88 (t, 6H, J = 8 Hz).3.1.2 4,7-Bis(5-bromo-4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(octyloxy)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (A4). 4,7-Bis(4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(octyloxy)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (7) (1.3 g) was dissolved into a mixture of acetic acid and chloroform (48 mL) (ratio 1:1). Then N-bromosuccinimide (0.567 g) was added at 0 °C, and after the addition of NBS, the cooling bath was removed and the reaction was stirred at ambient temperature for 24 h. The solution was then heated up to 55 °C for 24 h. The reaction was carefully monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The reaction mixture was cooled and poured into water. The mixture was extracted three times using chloroform. The chloroform parts were combined, washed with brine, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The crude product was purified by column chromatography using chloroform–hexanes as the eluent (ratio 1:4) to afford the product as a yellow solid (0.5 g, 32%). δH (400 MHz; CDCl3; Me4Si): 8.32 (s, 2H); 4.11 (t, 4H, J = 8 Hz); 2.65 (t, 2H, J = 8 Hz); 1.94 (m, 4H); 1.67 (m, 4H); 1.46–1.25 (m, 60H); 0.89 (t, 6H, J = 4 Hz).

MALDI TOF MS: m/z = 1050.26 (calculated m/z = 1050.42).3.2 General polymerizations3.2.1 Representative procedure for polymerization: polymerization of poly[2,2′-(9-(1-decylundecylidene)-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl)-alt-4,7-bis(4-dodecylthiophene-2-yl)-5,6-bis(octyloxy)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (P4). A mixture of 2,2′-(9-(heptadecan-9-ylidene)-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl)bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane) (0.196 g), 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-dodecylthiophene-2-yl)-5,6-bis(octyloxy)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (0.290 g) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4) (4 mg, 1 mol%) was dissolved into dry toluene (22 mL) and 2 M K2CO3 aqueous solution (3:2 in volume). The mixture was vigorously stirred at 80–85 °C for 48 h under nitrogen atmosphere. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, it was poured into water. The organic mixture was separated and washed with aqueous HCl, ammonium solution and deionized water, respectively. Then, the solvent was removed under the reduced pressure. The organic fraction was precipitated in methanol. The polymer was further purified by washing with methanol and acetone, respectively, in a Soxhlet apparatus for 24 h. The chloroform part was reprecipitated with methanol and then filtered, dried under reduced pressure at 60 °C (0.3 g, 80%).3.3 MeasurementsThe 1H NMR (400 MHz) spectra were recorded using a Brüker AMX400 spectrometer in CDCl3, and the chemical shifts were recorded in units of ppm with TMS as the internal standard. Mass spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu Biotech Axima confidence matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOD) mass spectrometer. The elemental analyses were measured with an EA1112 using a CE Instrument. The absorption spectra were recorded using an Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectroscopy system. The solutions that were used for the UV-visible spectroscopy measurements were dissolved in chloroform at a concentration of 10 μg mL−1. The films were drop-coated from the chloroform solution onto a quartz substrate. All of the GPC analyses were carried out using THF as an eluent and a polystyrene standard as the reference. The TGA measurements were performed using a TG 209 F3 thermogravimetric analyzer. The cyclic voltammetric waves were produced using a Zahner IM6eX electrochemical workstation with a 0.1 M acetonitrile (substituted with nitrogen for 20 min) solution containing tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) as the electrolyte at a constant scan rate of 50 mV s−1. ITO, a Pt wire, and silver/silver chloride [Ag in 0.1 M KCl] were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. The electrochemical potential was calibrated against Fc/Fc+. The HOMO levels of the polymers were determined using the oxidation onset value. Onset potentials are values obtained from the intersection of the two tangents drawn at the rising current and the baseline changing current of the CV curves. The LUMO levels were calculated from the differences between the HOMO energy levels and the optical band-gaps, which were determined using the UV-vis absorption onset values in the films. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the photovoltaic devices were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source measurement unit (SMU) that was equipped with a Class A Oriel solar simulator under an illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2). Topographic images of the active layers were obtained through atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode under ambient conditions using an XE-100 instrument.4 ConclusionsIn this study, four polymers were successfully synthesized through Suzuki coupling reaction by anchoring alkoxy and alkyl side chains to alkylidene fluorene (donor) and di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) derivatives (strong acceptor). The side-chain-less polymer P1 exhibited the lowest bandgap (1.84 eV) because of aggregation by strong π-stacking, however, its solubility and molecular weight were low. When side chains were introduced to both the spacer and the acceptor, soluble characteristics and molecular weight increased at room temperature. In P3, in which an octyloxy chain was introduced to the acceptor core, the highest molecular weight and face-on-rich structure were attained. In P4, which had both alkoxy and alkyl side chains, the strongest steric hindrance and edge-on-rich structure were found. Among the side-chain polymers, a high Voc of 0.88–0.98 V was detected. The highest PCE (3.6%) was observed in P3.NotesThe authors declare no competing financial interest.AcknowledgementsThis research was supported by a grant from the Fundamental R&D Program for Core Technology of Materials funded by the Ministry of Knowledge Economy, Republic of Korea.
