    , Accepted 13th February 2019First published on 14th February 2019AbstractTailoring the geometric and electronic structure is dynamically important for designing highly active catalyst materials, which remains a great challenge. Herein, our combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the electrocatalytic and photoelectrochemical activity of WO3 changes non-monotonically with the Mn or V doping concentration due to local changes in the reduced nature of WO3 and the formation of oxygen vacancies. For the hydrogen evolution reaction, at optimal Mn and V doping concentrations, the overpotential to reach ∼10 mA cm−2 is reduced by −97 mV and −38 mV vs. RHE; the Tafel slope is also reduced from 121 to 68 and 41 mV per decade (mV dec−1) compared to the undoped WO3, respectively. The improved activity arises from the fine tuning of the electronic structure and lessened free energy for atomic hydrogen adsorption. For photoelectrochemical water splitting, the photocurrent density is increased from 0.61 mA cm−2 for the undoped WO3 to ∼1.38 mA cm−2 and 2.49 mA cm−2 for optimal Mn and V doping, respectively. The photocurrent density at an optimal V doping is approximately 1.8 and 4.1 times higher than that at the optimal Mn doping and undoped WO3, respectively. Our work indicates a promising interface-engineering strategy for designing highly active non-precious electrocatalysts and photocatalysts for green energy conversion applications.
1 Introduction
Splitting water (2H2O → 2H2 + O2) to produce hydrogen (H2) and/or oxygen (O2) gases using either electrical energy or sunlight is extensively considered as a critical step in sustainable energy applications.1–3 In particular, progressive catalysts that provide vital chemical reactions in water splitting, namely the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), are based on noble metals such as Ru, Pt and Pd, whose scarcity and high cost obstruct their potentially scalable water splitting technologies.4–6 Thus, it is necessary to search for alternatives that are inexpensive, earth-abundant and possess a catalytic performance that is, at least, comparable to that of noble metal based catalysts. Recently, the quest for ideal and low cost alternative materials for water splitting reactions has been the subject of intensive investigation,7 in particular for use in large-scale applications where hydrogen gas may be generated in a clean and sustainable way.8,9 As a result, a wide range of chemical complexes, such as transition metal oxides, have been explored to advance electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting in acidic, alkaline and neutral media.10–14
In general, to attain a highly efficient HER activity, an appropriate hydrogen adsorption (Hads) Gibbs free energy (ΔGH) of electrocatalysts is essential.15,16 According to the Sabatier principle,17 the optimal value of ΔGH should be neither too positive nor too negative, signifying that hydrogen is bonded neither too weakly nor too strongly.18 Typically, a catalyst with high intrinsic electrical conductivity is also of great interest as this will ensure fast charge transfer kinetics and lower the Schottky barrier at the charge transfer interfaces.18 The use of a catalyst with highly exposed active sites at the surface will also accelerate the electrocatalytic reaction. Progress towards low-cost electrocatalysts for the HER with synchronized optimization of these factors is highly desirable, but remains technically challenging. For PEC water splitting, the choice of an appropriate photocatalyst with significant light absorption in the visible region is a prerequisite to increase the efficiency, which is dependent on the band-gap of the semiconductor.19–21 Hence, the band-gap energy between ca. 1.9–3.2 eV for a photoelectrode is desirable to achieve sizable photo-voltages.21 In addition, slow charge recombination is an important factor contributing to high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiencies. It is likely that rapid surface reaction kinetics can avoid surface charge accumulation, which would otherwise lead to electron–hole recombination. Finally, strong catalytic activity and stability are essential.22–24
A crucial step towards practical water splitting is to develop an approach for inexpensive scale-up of water splitting devices with the key characteristics described above. Among various potential semiconductors, tungsten oxide (WO3) has established itself as one of the best candidates for a wide range of research areas,25–27 including electrocatalytic28–30 and photoelectrochemical water splitting.31–33 Since the material is naturally abundant, cheap, with a tunable composition and is thermodynamically stable in an acidic environment, it has attracted intense research interest.2,34,35 However, in an acidic environment, WO3 exhibits a relatively poor HER activity, since the Hads on the W-site is not suitable.29 It is of interest to note that for electrocatalytic activity the adsorption energies of reactive intermediates can be tailored by tuning the geometric and electronic configurations of the catalytic material, resulting in an enhancement of catalytic activity.36,37 Thus, several approaches have been utilized to stimulate the HER activity of this metal oxide; this includes local atomic structure modulation,28 thermal reduction,29 doping,38 and creation of oxygen vacancies with conductive supports including carbon materials,39 which have been proposed for tungsten oxide to enhance the Hads strength. Similar strategies have also been utilized to enhance the PEC water splitting performance of WO3.31,40–42 In this regard, existence of oxygen vacancies and conductive supports was proposed to play a role in activating WO3 for the HER and/or OER reactions, and thereby increase the performance. Nonetheless, the core mechanism for water splitting reactions is yet to be absolutely elucidated, especially the role of tailoring the electronic structure. Moreover, tuning the geometric and electronic structures of WO3 to improve the OER and HER activity continues to remain a great challenge.
Huda and Wang et al. reported the possibility of tailoring the band structure of WO3 through metal doping.43,44 Metal dopants have the potential to influence any catalyst by four basic mechanisms: (i) creation of oxygen defects/vacancies and metallic nature, thereby increasing the electrical conductivity;45,46 (ii) enhancement of the separation of electron–hole pairs by selective trapping, typically at a low doping concentration;47 (iii) reduction of charge carrier lifetimes by the dopant acting as a charge recombination center;48 (iv) enhancement of optical absorption in a wider visible range by band gap shrinkage.44,49 We envisage that metal doping has the potential to be an effective approach for improving both the electrocatalytic HER and the PEC performance of WO3 based on the discussion above.
Herein, for the first time we developed a highly efficient electrocatalyst and/or photocatalyst by introducing manganese (Mn) or vanadium (V) into host WO3 nanoparticles. In order to find the optimum amount of doping, we adopted a facile synthesis strategy to prepare a series of samples including bare (undoped) WO3 and Mn or V doped WO3 nanoparticles. Structural, chemical and opto-electronic transport analyses support the nature of the degenerate semiconducting behavior of the Mn or V doped tungsten oxide samples. Due to the desirable ΔGH, high conductivity, and high active surface area provided by low Mn or V doping concentrations in WO3 nanoparticles with the appropriate morphology, the VW-S2 NPs with an optimum amount of V doping (3 wt%) create modest oxygen vacancies and reduce the WO3 content; as a result the VW-S2 catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic HER performance with a small overpotential of −38 mV at −10 mA cm−2 and a low Tafel slope of 41 mV dec−1. Further, during PEC water splitting tests, the VW-S2 NP photoelectrode exhibited ∼2.49 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The enhanced functional properties are attributed to the optimum electronic structural tuning, which creates the degenerate semiconducting behavior via appropriate V doping concentration (3 wt%) in the WO3 nanoparticles. This is confirmed by the DFT analyses of the electronic structure of WO3 doped with Mn or V, which shows that the dopants could lead to band gap shrinkage which can provide a highly active semiconducting metal oxide with higher electrical conductivity compared to the undoped WO3. In addition, this adjustment is accompanied by a significant reduction in ΔGH close to zero, which is ideal for the electrocatalytic HER.29
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Synthesis of bare WO3 and Mn or V doped WO3
The synthetic method of Mn-doped WO3 is as follows: Initially, analytical grade Na2WO4·2H2O (1.25 g) was dissolved in 40 mL deionized water under stirring at 90 °C. Then, H2SO4 solution (0.5 M) was added dropwise into tungstate solution to adjust the pH to 2 and then sonicated for 15 min followed by heating at 130 °C for 12 h. Later, different concentrations of MnCl2·4H2O (1 wt%, 3 wt% and 5 wt%) were added into the above-mentioned precursor solution under continuous stirring, then 3 mL of NaBH4 solution (0.1 M) was added dropwise to form Mn doped WO3 products. The resultant solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and was kept in an oven which was maintained at 120 °C for 24 h. After the hydrothermal reaction, the precipitates were washed several times with 1:1 ratio of deionized (DI) water and ethanol by filtration and dried in air. Finally, the products were dried at 450 °C for 3 h to obtain the final Mn-doped WO3. The same conditions were adopted for V doped WO3 (whereas NH4VO3 was used as a precursor solution instead of MnCl2·4H2O) and bare WO3 product (except the addition of V and/or Mn doping) synthesis. For easy classification, the 1 wt%, 3 wt% and 5 wt% of Mn doped WO3 samples were named MW-S1, MW-S2 and MW-S3, respectively. Likewise, 1 wt%, 3 wt% and 5 wt% of V doped samples were named VW-S1, VW-S2 and VW-S3, respectively.
2.2 Characterization methods
The crystallographic structures were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD, Rigaku-X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation; Rigaku Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The surface morphologies, elemental maps and energy dispersive spectra (EDS) were obtained using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM JEOL JSM 6500F; JEOL, Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, JEM-ARM200F; JEOL Ltd, USA.) The chemical states of the prepared samples were examined using a Thermo Scientific K-alpha X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA) instrument. Optical absorption studies and Raman analysis (vibrational, rotational and other low-frequency modes) were performed using an Analytik Jena SPECORD210 plus UV-Vis spectrometer (Analytik Jena Inc., Germany) and a Thermo Scientific DXR Raman spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA), respectively. Electrical properties were measured using a conventional four probe measurement system (Keithley 4200; Keithley Instruments, USA). A Micromeritics ASAP 2020 gas-sorption system (Micromeritics Inc, Germany) was adopted to study the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm at 77 K. The chemical composition was analysed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; NexIon300X, PerkinElmer). Finally, the oxygen vacancies were determined using an electron spin resonance (ESR, Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Germany) spectrophotometer.
2.3 Electrocatalytic hydrogen generation
All electrochemical studies were executed using an electrochemical workstation (BioLogic Science Instruments, SP-50, USA) coupled with a modulated speed rotator (MSR) electrode from Pine Research Instrumentation employing a three-electrode system with a modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 5 mm diameter) as a working electrode at room temperature, and Pt wire and Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. To prepare the working electrode, 5 mg of catalyst and 40 μL of 5 wt% Nafion solution (Sigma-Aldrich) were dispersed in 1 mL of water/ethanol (4:1 v/v) by sonication for at least 45 min to form a homogeneous catalyst ink. Then, 10 μL of the ink was deposited onto a 5 mm diameter GCE (loading amount 0.285 mg cm−2). Then the modified GCE was left to dry at 35 °C. For comparison, GCEs were also modified with commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) from Alfa Aesar. The electrocatalytic activity of the prepared catalysts towards the HER was scrutinized by polarization curves using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in high purity hydrogen saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. All of the potentials in this work were calibrated to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).28
2.4 Photoelectrochemical water splitting

2.4.1 Photoanode fabrication. 
For typical electrode fabrication, initially, the precursor solution was prepared by adding 0.35 g polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to a mixed solvent containing 3 mL N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) mixed with 1 mL ethanol, and stirred for 3 h. Then, 1 g of the catalyst was added to the above solution, followed by stirring for 1 h to obtain a homogeneous solution. Subsequently, substrates of fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass electrodes with an area of 1 × 1 cm−2 were pre-cleaned by successive ultra-sonication for 10 min in water/ethanol solution. Before the coating of the nanoparticles, the FTO substrates were preserved in a UV–O3 chamber for 10 min. Finally, the prepared precursor solution was spin coated on the FTO glass substrate (2000 rpm for 40 s, using 50 μL of the precursor for each deposited layer), whereas the thickness of all electrodes was maintained at 600 nm. These electrodes were dried on a hot plate preheated to 180 °C for 5 min and then annealed at 250 °C for 1 h.


2.4.2 Photoelectrochemical water splitting testing. 
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) tests were performed using a three-electrode electrochemical workstation (IvimStat, IVIUM Tech) at room temperature. The system was composed of a photoelectrode (1 × 1 cm−2) as the working electrode, a platinum (Pt) wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. Freshly prepared 0.1 M aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte solution was used for the PEC test. The PEC performance was determined using a solar simulator (10500, Abet Tech, Xe lamp, AM 1.5 global filter, one sun power). Finally, the measured potential vs. Ag/AgCl was calibrated to RHE.28 All experiments were performed with a sweep rate of 20 mV s−1. To further evaluate the performance of the prepared photoelectrodes, the applied bias photo-to-current conversion (ABPE) of all samples was calculated using the following equation;50 ABPE = J(1.23 − V)/Ilight(1)where V is the applied bias vs. RHE, J is the photocurrent density at the measured bias, and Ilight is the irradiance intensity of 100 mW cm−2.

2.5 Computational studies

2.5.1 DFT analysis of electronic structure tuning. 
All DFT computations were performed by using the plane-wave technique as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) with ultra-soft pseudo potentials.51,52 Spin-polarized local density approximation was employed for the exchange–correlation energy53 with a plane wave cutoff of 500 eV. A gamma-centered 5 × 5 × 5 k-mesh was used to optimize the structure until all residual forces decline below 0.02 eV Å−1, while a 7 × 7 × 7 k-mesh was adopted for total energy and electronic structure calculations.


2.5.2 Free energy calculation method. 
For HER activity calculations, first-principles calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package with the spin-polarized Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange–correlation functional,53 including the van der Waals correction of Grimme.54 A cutoff energy of 450 eV was used for the plane-wave expansion.55,56 A four-layer R 45° slab with a vacuum layer of 15 Å thickness was used to model the WO3 (001) surface. Due to the reduction conditions in the HER, WO2 termination was employed. Since the slabs are asymmetric, a dipole correction was used.57
The Brillouin zone is sampled using a (3 × 3 × 1) k-mesh using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme. The geometry is optimized until all residual forces are less than 0.01 eV Å−1. The adsorption energy of H on surfaces is defined as, Ead = EH/surf − 1/2EH2 − Esurf(2)where EH/surf, EH2, and Esurf are the total energies of H adsorbed surfaces, H2 molecules in the gas phase and clean surfaces, respectively. The change of Gibbs free energy for H adsorption is, ΔGH* = Ead +ΔZPE − TΔS(3)with ΔZPE and ΔS being the zero-point energy and entropy differences between the adsorbed state and the gas phase. Since ΔZPE − TΔS is approximately 0.20 eV,28 we obtain ΔGH* = Ead + 0.20 eV.

3 Results and discussion
At the start, we assumed that Mn or V doping can activate tungsten oxides for water splitting reactions. In addition, it is noted that achieving a smaller particle size, higher surface area, and larger number of active sites is also a promising structural design approach for the improvement of water splitting performance. Therefore, we aimed to prepare WO3 nanoparticles with sufficient amounts of Mn or V doping and thus provide abundant active sites and high conductivity. The crystalline structure and chemical nature of the prepared products were characterized using XRD, XPS and Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of WO3, MW-S1, MW-S2, MW-S3, VW-S1, VW-S2 and VW-S3 NPs. In pristine WO3, all diffraction peaks could be easily indexed to the monoclinic pattern of standard WO3 (JCPDS card no. 043-1035). However, the Mn doped WO3 (see Fig. 1a) and V doped WO3 (see Fig. 1b) samples display a mixture of a major monoclinic pattern (JCPDS card no. 043-1035) with two minor orthorhombic phases (JCPDS card no. 043-0679) in the XRD pattern with the orthorhombic peaks detected at 2θ = 19.06° and 30.51° for Mn doped WO3 samples, and at 2θ = 52.81° and 57.40° for V doped WO3 samples. These peaks might be due to the lattice distortion of the crystal structure by the incorporation of Mn and V atoms. This phenomenon has been reported previously in the literature, especially for nanoparticles prepared by a hydrothermal method.58–60 Besides, it is also noted that for the strongest peak, the intensity decreases and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) increases with the increase of dopant concentration of Mn or V. Furthermore, the peaks are shifted toward the lower angle side compared to the pristine WO3 (see insets in Fig. 1). This is due to the similar ionic radius of Mn2+ (0.81 Å), Mn3+ (0.72 Å), V5+ (0.68 Å), V4+ (0.72 Å) and V3+ (0.78 Å) ions to that of the W6+ (0.74 Å) ion; (multiple valences are revealed by XPS, as can be seen from Fig. 2). Smaller ions of Mn or V can easily enter the crystal site of W which might result in a minor orthorhombic phase by lattice distortion, and also lead to a higher FWHM and lower diffraction angle. In addition, for Mn doped WO3 samples, no other diffraction peaks related to Mn2O3, Mn3O4 or Mn were identified; and for V doped WO3 samples, no other diffraction peaks related to V, V2O3, VO2, or V2O5 phases were observed. These results suggest that the Mn or V dopant ions were highly dispersed in the WO3 lattice. This is in good agreement with XPS and Raman analysis. Notably, the small amount of doping can effectively tune the electronic nature of WO3, without any original structural modification of WO3. Compared to Mn doping, V doping creates optimum impurity levels below the WO3 conduction band, thus decreasing the band gap (Eg) as shown in Fig. S1 and Table S1 in the ESI.† These results are consistent with our DFT modelling (see Section 3.4), that is, usually the contributions from dopants (e.g. Mn or V in our case) at a low doping concentration are treated as defect levels, which are not expected to alter the semiconducting nature of the host. If the doping concentration is high enough, dopants are likely to destroy the semiconducting nature of the host.49

Fig. 2, S2 and S3† show the W4f, O1s, Mn2p and V2p core level spectra of the prepared products. For the undoped WO3, only two sharp peaks with binding energies at 35.66 and 37.73 eV can be observed, which are associated with the characteristic W4f7/2 and 4f5/2 peaks of the W6+ species.28 In the cases of MW-S2 and VW-S2 NPs, both peaks are slightly broader with binding energy regions of 35.64 and 37.83 eV, and 35.12 and 37.42 eV, respectively. The core-level spectra of W4f7/2 can be deconvoluted into typical binding energies of W5+ of ∼34.93 and 34.81 eV (ref. 28 and 29), respectively, for MW-S2 and VW-S2, indicating the co-existence of W5+ ions with oxygen (O) vacancies. In addition, the visibly different peak areas of W5+ show that the VW-S2 nanoparticles possess considerable oxygen vacancies compared with the MW-S2. In the deconvoluted O1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 2d), the peak at 531.02 eV is related to an oxygen vacancy, which further suggests that VW-S2 contained moderate amounts of oxygen vacancies.28,30 In addition, the oxygen vacancies were determined by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy (Fig. S4†), a tool for probing unpaired electrons in materials. The VW-S2 sample uniquely displays a symmetrical ESR signal at g = 2.008, demonstrating the trapping of electrons at oxygen vacancies.61 Chemical stoichiometries based on the relative atomic ratio of the prepared products from XPS and EDS analyses are shown in Table S2.† Moreover, the percentages of Mn and V dopants were measured by ICP-MS. The contents of Mn in MW-S1, MW-S2 and MW-S3 were 0.83%, 2.79% and 4.56%, and those of V in VW-S1, VW-S2 and VW-S3 were 0.78%, 2.83% and 4.63%, respectively.

Fig. 3 presents the Raman spectra of the prepared products, where the peaks at 273 cm−1 and 325 cm−1 are due to the O–W–O bending vibration, and the peaks at 716 cm−1 and 806 cm−1 are ascribed to the O–W–O stretching vibration. Notably, the samples MW-S1, MW-S2 and MW-S3 exhibit sharp patterns similar to the undoped WO3, whereas Mn peaks become visible and increased if the doping concentration is too high (i.e. 5 wt% of Mn). As shown in Fig. 3a, the strongest and increased peak intensity at 886 cm−1 belongs to the symmetric Ag vibration of the terminal WO2.62,63 Remarkably, compared to the Mn doped WO3 samples (i.e. MW-S1 to S3 samples), V doping increases the WO3 loss/reduction features in VW-S1 to S3 samples, which also correlates with the XPS analysis. For the VW-S2 sample, all the modes are very weak and broad with a small shift toward lower wavenumbers compared to undoped WO3. This may be ascribed to the presence of abundant defects or oxygen vacancies or reduced WO3 after V doping of 3 wt%,28 which correlates with high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images (see Fig. 4). Notably, at an optimal V concentration (i.e. 3 wt% of V on WO3), the decreases in the stretching vibrations are characterized by broadening and suppression of the peaks at 716 cm−1 and 806 cm−1 in Fig. 3b, and development of terminal bonds W6+O (intensity of the peak at 960 cm−1).64 There are no other peaks analogous to the stretching modes of V3–O (∼520 cm−1), V2–O (∼650 cm−1) and V5+O (∼1029 cm−1).65 From these results, it may be concluded that V occupying the substitutional site in WO3 gives rise to a bond similar to W6+O and with a slight lattice distortion and stronger interaction with the nearest neighbors; there is also a slight broadening of the peaks in the range between 940 cm−1 and 960 cm−1.64,66,67 Similar observations of the reduced nature of WO3 were previously reported by Li et al.28 and Zheng et al.,29 and this unusual property is highly favored and can be considered as a promising strategy to improve the electrocatalytic activity of tungsten oxide based systems.

 Fig. 4  (a–c) and (d–f) are TEM images and insets in (c) and (f) are the SAED patterns of MW-S2 and VW-S2 samples, respectively. 
As shown in Fig. S5–S11,† all the prepared products exhibited a nanoparticle dimension. Typical TEM images (Fig. 4) reveal that the MW-S2 and VW-S2 products exhibit a nanoparticle morphology with a lateral size of ∼50–70 nm and 20–30 nm, respectively. Fig. 4c shows an HRTEM image of MW-S2. Two sets of lattice fringes are visibly perceived with a lattice spacing of 0.362 nm and 0.373 nm, corresponding to the (200) and (020) planes of tungsten oxide. The VW-S2 product exhibited a lattice spacing of 0.375 nm, corresponding to the (020) plane of tungsten oxide. In addition, disorders and distortions can be found, which are possibly caused by the substitution of metal ions during the synthesis process and offer an unusual defect-rich structure.68–70 Further, electron density mapping and the corresponding chemical compositions were identified and are shown in Fig. S5–S11.†
Electrocatalytic HER measurements were performed using a standard three-electrode setup in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Fig. 5a shows the representative polarization curves of the undoped WO3, Mn doped WO3 and V doped WO3 products, along with the benchmark Pt/C (20 wt% Pt) for comparison. The undoped WO3 displays low HER activity with a high overpotential exceeding −411 mV vs. RHE. In contrast, the Mn doped WO3 exhibited appreciably lower overpotentials and higher current densities (Fig. 5a and S12†). Surprisingly, the VW-S2 NPs exhibited a remarkable HER activity with a low onset potential near zero and a small overpotential of −38 mV vs. RHE at a current density of −10 mA cm−2, and those for MW-S2 and undoped WO3 are approximately −97 and −411 mV vs. RHE, respectively. The resultant Tafel plots in Fig. 5b indicate that doping with Mn or V significantly reduces the Tafel slope from 121 mV dec−1 for the undoped WO3 to 68 mV dec−1 and 41 mV dec−1 for MW-S2 and VW-S2, respectively, approaching that of commercial Pt/C (32 mV dec−1). As such, the rate limiting step for undoped WO3 is the Volmer reaction, whereas that for doped systems is the Heyrovsky reaction71,72 and more negative potentials drive a rapid increase of the cathodic current, suggesting the potential of VW-S2 as a high performance electrocatalyst for hydrogen generation. Indeed, at an optimal concentration (3 wt% of V), this highly efficient HER performance of the VW-S2 is higher than that of previously reported tungsten-based HER electrocatalysts and comparable to that of the best non-precious-metal based HER electrocatalysts (Table S3†). The accelerated HER reaction kinetics is induced by the creation of oxygen vacancies by metal ion doping and simultaneous reduction of WO3 (which is also confirmed by DFT analysis, see Section 2.5). Moreover, the electrical resistivities at 300 K are 0.46 × 102 and 0.11 × 102 Ω cm for MW-S2 and VW-S2, respectively, which are lower than that of the undoped WO3 (1.20 × 102 Ω cm, Table S1†). Mn and V doping therefore significantly enhanced the conductivity of the undoped tungsten oxide. These electrical transport properties indicate that the electronic behavior of Mn or V doped WO3 materials is intermediate between those of the semiconductor and the metal, which is related to that of a degenerate semiconductor nature.

The long-term durability of VW-S2 was also assessed by chronoamperometry (i–t) at a constant potential of −100 mV vs. RHE in 0.5 M H2SO4 (Fig. 5d), showing that the catalysts worked for a long period of 14000 s with an almost stable current density, whereas only a small current reduction (∼17.3% of current degradation (i.e. ∼3.32 mA) after 14000 s) is observed. In addition, after durability tests, a small positive potential shift was observed during linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) (Fig. 5d). After the durability test, the composition and structure remained almost the same as before the HER tests (Fig. S13†). Significantly, the excellent HER performance by experimental analysis of VW-S2 indicates that, compared to the low level of Mn doping, V doping may create optimum oxygen vacancies where the metallic nature and the reduced WO3 introduce gap states around the Fermi level in the VW-S2 products. Upon Mn or V doping, the appearance of new electronic states could provide a fast charge transport reaction and also allow favorable hydrogen adsorption, both of which activate the WO3 metal oxide for the HER (which is also confirmed by DFT analysis, see theory section). Meanwhile, for the VW-S2 products, the small particle size (20–30 nm), the enhancement in metallic nature and the defect structure are also significant structural factors to provide superior HER activity, which provide larger surface areas, highly conductive nature and abundant active sites.29
As for the PEC tests, a standard three-electrode system was used with undoped WO3 or Mn or V-doped WO3 as the working electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode and a wire of Pt as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. A commonly used electrolyte of 0.1 M Na2SO4 was used to assess the PEC performance of the prepared products (Fig. 6). The photocurrent density of the undoped WO3 is ∼0.61 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The achieved photocurrent density of undoped WO3 is comparable with that of previously reported high performance photoelectrodes (see Table S4†). For Mn or V-doped WO3, an improved PEC water splitting activity was initially observed with an increase in doping concentrations up to a specific level (see Fig. 6). The photocurrent density is increased from 0.61 mA cm−2 to ∼1.38 and 2.49 mA cm−2 for MW-S2 and VW-S2 samples, respectively, whereas a cathodic shift in potential is observed. Remarkably, the photocurrent density of VW-S2 is approximately 1.8 and 4.1 times higher than that of MW-S2 and the undoped WO3, respectively. However, a further increase in the doping concentration results in a rapid decrease in water splitting performance and this is observed for both Mn and V doping. Additionally, an ABPE calculation has been performed to determine the photocurrent conversion efficiency of the prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 6b, compared with undoped WO3 and Mn doped samples, an improvement in ABPE was detected in 3 wt% V-doped WO3 (VW–S2), which was reliable with their J–V characteristics. The MW-S1, MW-S3, VW-S1 and VW-S3 materials exhibit a relatively low ABPE value under visible light conditions. The decreased performance for a higher doping concentration (i.e. 5 wt%) could be attributed to the increased number of recombination sites generated by excessive doping. Moreover, the photo-stability and photon sensing properties of the prepared electrodes were tested at an overpotential of 0.9 V vs. RHE for 1600 s, as shown in Fig. 6c, while the current density remains almost stable. As shown in Fig. S14,† the VW-S2 photoelectrode exhibited excellent long term PEC water splitting durability for ∼10000 s with only a slight photo-current loss (∼0.11 mA cm−2). It is believed that the enhanced PEC water splitting performance observed with an optimal amount of V doping in VW-S2 is more likely due to the enhanced optical absorption by electronic structure tuning, improved donor density and electrical conductivity. In addition, a comparatively smaller particle size (20–30 nm) and higher surface area of the VW-S2 sample exhibited higher photocurrent density than other samples, possibly due to the reduced diffusion path length for holes. It remains a great challenge to improve the intrinsic electronic structure or decrease density of trap states of WO3 materials so that a longer photoexcited charge carrier lifetime and more efficient charge separation can be achieved. Furthermore, to evaluate PEC performance of our prepared photoelectrode, a comparison of the photocurrent with previous reports is presented in Table S4.† It can be found from this table that WO3 containing an optimal amount of V as the building block of the PEC electrode possesses a high photocurrent and is a potential candidate for next-generation photocatalytic energy conversion materials.

On the basis of the above experimental studies, we thus systematically studied the electronic structures and hydrogen binding ability of their most stable surface. Initially, first-principles calculations were used to understand the electronic structures of WO3 tuned by Mn or V doping. A monoclinic WO3 unit cell containing 8 W and 24 O atoms was built (Fig. 7a), since XRD analysis indicated the monoclinic structure (space group P21) of the undoped WO3.47 Considering the XRD analyses (Fig. 1), the prepared Mn or V-doped WO3 seems to persist in the monoclinic form and low-level substitutional doping is highly preferred in this system, thus one tungsten (W) atom has been replaced by a Mn or V atom in the WO3 to signify the doped system, as shown in Fig. 7a and b. The Eg of undoped WO3 is found to be ∼1.31 eV, which is much lower than that attained from the experiment (∼2.69 eV; Fig. S1†). We attribute this discrepancy to the computational analysis and several researchers have described a similar band gap for WO3 (indirect band gap nature, 1.1 eV to 1.4 eV) using DFT modeling.43,47,73,74 Therefore we envisage that this Eg value is suitable for the system (Table S5†).

The band structures of (c) pristine and (d and e) Mn (or V)-doped WO3, where red lines in (d) and (e) indicate the contribution from Mn and V dopants, respectively. 
For an ideal surface, i.e. undoped WO3, the density of states (DOS) offers a classic semiconducting nature, whereas the Fermi level is positioned within the mid of the band gap without any electron distribution nearby the Fermi level (Fig. 7c), which is consistent with previously reported results.43,47 When Mn was introduced into WO3, new energy levels appear at the conduction band minimum (CBM) of W5d, see Fig. 7d. In addition, the existence of Mn or V atoms provides the WO3 slab with improved DOS at the CBM of W5d, see Fig. 7e. Remarkably, for the two models with Mn or V doping, although there is a band gap shrinkage, the Fermi levels cross the conduction band minimum (CBM) of W5d, which is the usual characteristic of a degenerate semiconductor.29,39,75 A degenerate semiconductor is a perfectly doped semiconductor where the Fermi level is located in the conduction or valence band, which has been largely used in electronic and optoelectronic device applications.75,76 As shown in Fig. 7 and S15,† the existence of state density distribution around the Fermi level directs to a number of charge carriers, which results in the degenerate semiconductor acting more like a metal than a semiconductor. In our case, WO3 with Mn or V doping should be a degenerate semiconductor with a large number of electrons in the conduction band, giving rise to an increase in electrical conductivity. In support of this theoretical analysis, the absorption of the prepared samples has been red-shifted with an increase in Mn or V concentration (3 wt%); accordingly, the results of our theoretical modeling are consistent with the experimental absorption spectrum (Fig. S1†) that an optimal amount of doping is essential. In addition, after metal ion doping, the decrease of the CBM and an increase of the VBM in metal doped semiconductors have also been reported by other research studies,44,47,49 which are beneficial for energy conversion systems.
Based on the electronic structures of the tungsten oxide with Mn and V doping, we further evaluated the HER activities of the W sites on the (001) surface (see Table 1, S6† and Fig. 8). The ΔGH, scaling with ΔGH* and bond lengths between H and the bonded atom (dH–A) on undoped and Mn- or V-doped WO3 surfaces, has been successfully used as a descriptor of HER activity.77,78 It has been revealed that the value of ΔGH is strongly dependent on the electronic structures of materials. As shown in Fig. 8b–d, both Mn and V dopants energetically prefer to stay in the surface layer sites, which suggests that Mn or V doping reduces ΔGH* to −0.11 and 0.08 eV at Ob sites, respectively, signifying that Mn- or V-doped WO3 can exhibit higher HER activity than the undoped WO3 system, which strongly supports our experimental results (Fig. 5 and Table S3†). Our DFT observations thus suggest that (i) Mn or V incorporated into WO3 systems indicates that low concentration metallic dopants create defect levels that are responsible for optical band gap reduction in WO3, (ii) compared to Mn doping, the multivalent V bonding with terminal oxygen in the WO3 lattice gives rise to localized covalent bonds and results in an increase in HER activity and (iii) if the dopant concentration is high, dopants are likely to destroy the semiconducting nature of the host. Moreover, WO3 doped with Mn or V serves as a degenerate semiconductor, with potential to serve as a promising low cost and naturally abundant HER catalyst.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we combined experimental and DFT analyses to explore the effect of Mn or V doping concentration on WO3 towards HER and PEC water splitting reactions. Experimentally, we synthesized bare WO3, Mn- or V- doped WO3 nanoparticles using a facile hydrothermal method. With the optimal amount of vanadium doping (3 wt%), oxygen vacancies, metallic nature of the material, tuned electronic properties, high electrical conductivity and suitable Gibbs free energy were obtained. These factors, combined with the nanoparticle size (20–30 nm) provide a high active surface area. The 3 wt% V-doped WO3 (VW-S2) exhibited excellent HER catalytic activity compared to all other samples (including undoped and Mn doped WO3) and it approaches that of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, compared with the undoped WO3 and Mn doped WO3 samples, significantly improved PEC performance was observed for 3 wt% V-doped WO3 (2.49 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE). The improvement was ascribed to the enhanced optical absorption by electronic structure tuning, improved donor density as well as electrical conductivity and reduced diffusion path lengths after doping. In addition, the creation of oxygen vacancies and reduced nature of WO3 were achieved after doping, which provided increased charge carrier density in marginally doped WO3. In addition, DFT studies revealed that the Mn or V doping transforms a conventional WO3 semiconductor into a degenerate WO3 semiconducting material, with improved metallic nature and more suitable Gibbs free energy. Notably, both Mn and/or V dopants are energetically favorable to stay in the surface layer sites of WO3, which tunes the electronic nature of the WO3. Moreover, Mn and V doping reduces the free energy of ΔGH* to −0.11 and 0.08 eV at Ob sites, respectively, which explains why Mn- or V-doped WO3 possesses higher HER activity compared to the undoped WO3 system. From the present study, both experimental and theoretical analyses elucidate the mechanism of the interfacial catalyst, which paves a new strategy to develop highly efficient and noble-metal-free electrocatalysts and photocatalysts for green energy applications.
