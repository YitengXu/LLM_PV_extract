    , Accepted 24th October 2017First published on 24th October 2017AbstractThe intense red up-conversion luminescence in Sc2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ synthesized using a biphasic solvothermal (ST) method was observed upon laser diode pumping at 980 nm. Compared with that found in the bulk sample synthesized using a solid state (SS) reaction at the same sintering temperature (700 °C), the green and red up-conversion luminescence are enhanced by a factor of 19.7 and 23.4, respectively. The relative red intensity of the sample prepared using the ST method at 700 °C for 2 h was enhanced up to 6.6 times compared to that obtained by the SS reaction method at 1600 °C for 6 h. On analyzing the spectral distribution, power dependence and decay curves of Yb3+, we revealed that the red emission of the Er3+:4F9/2 level in Sc2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ was populated via three possible routes, i.e. excited-state absorption (ESA), two-step energy transfer up-conversion (ET) and non-multiphonon relaxation mechanism from the (2H11/2, 4S3/2) via cross-relaxation and energy back transfer (CRB). For the green up-conversion of the Er3+:(2H11/2, 4S3/2) level, a three-photon process described as Yb3+:2F5/2 + Er3+:4F9/2 → Yb3+:2F7/2 + Er3+:2H9/2 occurs in the Sc2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ material. The results indicate that ST-Sc2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ can act as an efficient up-converting red light emitter and ST-Sc2O3 is an appropriate oxide host for up-conversion luminescence.
1. Introduction
Since the discovery of up-conversion luminescence (UCL) by Auzel in the 1960s,1,2 it has undergone rapid development, particularly, over the past two decades. Potential applications include solar cells, novel displays, sensors3–5 and, more recently, biolabelling and in vivo biomedical imaging.6–8 Up-converting materials used as probes for single molecule imaging in biological cells require nanoparticles with high brightness and continuous emission as well as a minimal spectral overlap with cellular autofluorescence. Among the previously reported up-conversion materials, trivalent rare earth ion combinations, such as Er3+/Yb3+, Tm3+/Yb3+ and Ho3+/Yb3+, have been typically used as activators due to their abundant electronic states, long-lived intermediate metastable state, and ladder-like energy levels, where consecutive absorptions of low-energy light push electrons up to higher energy levels.9–12
The Er3+/Yb3+ combination has been recognized as an excellent red UCL emitter because it is capable of up-converting a near infrared beam issued from a 980 nm laser diode (LD) into a 650 nm red emission and 550 nm green emission. It allows both the pump and dominant UCL wavelengths within the tissue optical transmission window (650–1300 nm), which is advantageous for deeper penetration and detection in tissues.13,14 However, due to effective coupling to the lattice vibrations of the host materials, most of the intermediate-state excitations relax quite rapidly to lower lying levels producing non-radiative relaxation. The UC efficiency is significantly hampered due to the phonon quenching effect. Fluoride, such as hexagonal Na(Y, Lu)F4, is generally considered to be the best host material for achieving the most efficient UCL.15,16 Nevertheless, a highly efficient UCL is still strongly expected in oxide materials due to their higher chemical durability and thermal stability.7,13,17
Cubic sesquioxide materials (such as Y2O3, Lu2O3, Sc2O3, etc.) have attracted attention due to their favourable structural characteristics (no charge compensation with RE3+ doping, short cation–cation distances and high doping concentration) and physical properties, such as relatively low phonon frequency, large Stark splitting, chemical stability and high thermal conductivity.18 To date, Y2O3 has been widely adopted as the typical oxide host exhibiting the most efficient UCL in oxide up-converting materials.13,19 The Er3+/Yb3+ UCL efficiency in Y2O3 was reduced by 4 times compared to that observed in NaYF4.19 The oxide Y2O3 presents higher chemical and thermal stability in air compared with the fluoride NaYF4.
In the family of sesquioxide materials, Sc2O3 has the smallest lattice parameter, which causes highest density of cationic sites (3.338 × 1022 cm−3) and the shortest Sc–Sc distance (3.27 Å). The short Sc–O bond length in Sc2O3 can produce a strong crystal field, resulting in the larger splitting of doped ions (Yb3+/Er3+). The short distance within an Yb3+–Er3+ pair can speed up Yb3+ → Er3+ ET. However, a major shortcoming of the sesquioxides is their very high melting temperatures, which makes the sample preparation of Sc2O3via a conventional SS method require a high temperature sintering step.18,20 Moreover, the applications of the Sc2O3 material obtained via the SS method are restricted in biological assays and medical imaging due to their large size and poor dispersion. In the present work, to the best of our knowledge, up-converting Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped Sc2O3 materials with intense red emission UC were synthesized using a biphasic ST method for the first time. Additionally, the UCL properties and UC mechanism of Sc2O3:Er3+,Yb3+ phosphors were investigated by spectra distribution, power dependence, and lifetime measurements.
2. Experimental
2.1 Sample preparation
The Sc2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ samples were prepared using a biphasic ST method. The nanoparticles were prepared via the hydrolysis of relevant mineral salts in an ethanol–toluene solvent system. The high purity raw materials of Sc2O3, Er2O3, and Yb2O3 powders were dissolved in dilute HNO3 and deionized water to obtain cationic nitrates solutions. The Sc(NO3)3, Er(NO3)3, and Yb(NO3)3 solutions with the corresponding molar ratios were dissolved in absolute ethanol (20 mL) and stirred to form a homogeneous solution. Then, the pH of the solution was modulated to the desired value (pH = 7) upon the addition of tert-butylamine with stirring for 30 min. Subsequently, an organic solution of oleic acid (2 mL) and toluene (15 mL) was mixed with vigorous stirring for 60 min until it became transparent. The gelatinous solution was transferred into a closed Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with 50 mL capacity and heated at 160 °C for 24 h. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed several times with absolute ethanol. The powder was obtained after being dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h and annealed at various temperatures (600, 700, and 800 °C) for 2 h. For comparison, we prepared Sc2O3 bulk powders using the SS method at various sintering temperatures (700, 1000, 1300, and 1600 °C) for 6 h.
2.2 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) on an X-ray powder diffractometer (Rigaku D/Max IIA). TEM images were obtained using a transmission electron microscopy (JEM-2000EX) system operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded at room temperature on a spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-7000) equipped with a power-controllable 980 nm CW diode laser. The infrared spectra were measured using a FLS920 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, UK). In the fluorescence lifetime measurements, an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) was tuned to 980 nm as an excitation source, and the signals were detected on a Tektronix digital oscilloscope (TDS 3052).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Phase purity and crystal structure
The sintering temperature in the experimental process has a great effect on the crystallinity and photoluminescence intensity of the sample; thus, it was necessary to determine an optimal synthesis temperature. The structures characterized by the XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 1(a) for the Sc2O3:10%Yb3+,1%Er3+ phosphors prepared using a biphasic ST method at different annealing temperatures (600, 700, and 800 °C) for 2 h, accompanied by the XRD curves of the bulk Sc2O3 powder prepared using a SS method at various sintering temperatures (700, 1000, 1300, and 1600 °C) for 6 h. For the ST-Sc2O3:Yb3+/Er3+ sample annealed at 600 °C, the characteristic diffraction peaks are in good agreement with the standard cubic phase of Sc2O3 (JCPDS no. 84-1884). The broad XRD peaks are ascribed to the low reaction temperature,21,22 which indicate the samples synthesized by ST method have small sizes. The diffraction peaks become narrower as the annealing temperature is increased for the ST samples, suggesting that the crystal size increases gradually. The average crystal size of the agglomerates was calculated using the Debye–Scherrer formula and increased from ∼145 nm to ∼1000 nm when the annealing temperature was increased from 600 °C to 800 °C. In the SS synthesis, pure phase Sc2O3 was detected until 1600 °C. The Yb2O3 raw material (JCPDS no. 41-1106) still remains in the samples sintered at 1300 °C. The dopants Yb3+ and Er3+ ions do not completely enter the lattice of the host when temperature is below 1600 °C in the SS reaction. Fig. 1(b) shows the crystal structure of Sc2O3, which corresponds to the mineral bixbyite with Ia (Th2) symmetry. The coordination number for Sc3+ was six and there are two coordinated Sc3+ sites in Sc2O3. The six-fold Sc3+ has a small radius (0.745 Å), which determines the rather small cubic lattice parameter a = 9.857 Å. The two Sc–O distances are 2.119 Å and 2.124 Å.

The morphology of the ST-Sc2O3:Yb3+/Er3+ sample annealed at 700 °C was characterized by TEM as shown in Fig. 2. The rod-like nanoparticles with lengths up to 10 nm are bunched forming wires. At an annealing temperature of 700 °C, the as-obtained nanoparticles are agglomerated.

3.2. Concentration dependence of the emission spectra

Fig. 3 shows the UCL spectra of Sc2O3:10%Yb3+,1%Er3+ prepared using the ST and SS methods pumped using a laser diode at 980 nm with an output power density of 3 mW mm−2. The spectra exhibit two UC emission bands corresponding to green and red emission peaking around 520–580 nm and 630–730 nm, which are assigned to the (2H11/2, 4S3/2) → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, respectively. The UCL emission spectra of the Sc2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ sample prepared using the solvothermal (ST) method at different annealing temperatures (600, 700, and 800 °C) for 2 h are shown in Fig. S1.† The UCL intensity increases as the annealing temperature increases. The high temperature, on one hand, promotes the crystallization of the sample and on the other hand, seems to cause aggregation and growth of the nanoparticles, which reduces the surface defects leading to an enhanced UCL. Fig. 3(a) shows the UCL spectra of the samples achieved using the two approaches and sintered at an identical temperature of 700 °C. It reveals that the UCL has been dramatically enhanced for the ST sample compared with the SS sample. The calculated enhancement factor of the green and red UCL are as large as 19.7 and 23.4, respectively. This is because the Yb3+ ions can completely enter the lattice of the host at a lower temperature in the ST method. In particular, the red UCL was aspired to be selectively enhanced. Fig. 3(b) shows the UCL spectra of the pure phase samples prepared using the ST method at 700 °C for 2 h and SS reaction method at 1600 °C for 6 h. The spectra have been normalized by the green emission intensity. The relative red intensity of the sample prepared using the ST method was 6.6 times that prepared using the SS reaction method. The population of the (2H11/2, 4S3/2) and 4F9/2 levels is strongly governed by the non-radiative relaxation from the 4I11/2 to the 4I13/2 levels; hence, the increase in the red relative intensity was due to the increased non-radiative transition rate of Er3+:4I11/2 → 4I13/2 in the ST samples.

In order to describe the population mechanism in the Yb3+ and Er3+ co-doped Sc2O3 material, the dependence of the spectral distribution on the Yb3+ and Er3+ concentrations was studied in detail. The UCL spectra of Sc2O3:10%Yb3+,x%Er3+ (x = 0.5, 1, 2, 4) under excitation at 980 nm are presented in Fig. 4(a). For a fixed Yb3+ concentration of 10%, the strongest UCL (red and green) was observed for an Er3+ concentration around 1%. When the Er3+ concentration is over 1%, the intensity begins to diminish because of the cross relaxation of Er3+ ions.23 The UCL spectra of Sc2O3:y%Yb3+,1%Er3+ (y = 5, 10, 20) are presented in Fig. 4(b). For the Er3+ singly doped Sc2O3, the UC emission was very faint. The ET process of Yb3+ → Er3+ plays a dominant role in the UCL enhancement. For the optimal Er3+ concentration of 1%, the UCL was strongest when the Yb3+ concentration was 5%.

The infrared emission spectra from 1000 nm to 1650 nm of the same series of Sc2O3:y%Yb3+,x%Er3+ (x: 0.5–4, y: 0–20) samples are presented in Fig. 5. The infrared spectra show the typical 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 emission of Yb3+ around 1050 nm and a broad band around 1600 nm corresponding to the Er3+:4I13/2 → 4I15/2 transition. Fig. 5(a) shows that the Yb3+ emission has a monotonic decline as the Er3+ concentration increases. This can be considered as an indication of efficient Yb3+ → Er3+ ET. The Er3+ emission declines slightly as the Er3+ concentration increases over 1% as a result of Er3+ self-absorption.23Fig. 5(b) shows that the Yb3+ emission reaches a maximum when the Yb3+ concentration reaches 5% and then decreases quickly. At the same Yb3+ concentration, the Er3+:4I13/2 emission reaches a maximum. The distances of the Yb–Yb and Yb–Er pairs decrease as the Yb3+ concentration increases, and then the enhanced energy migration among Yb3+ ions speeds up the ET from Yb3+ to Er3+.23 This leads to the population in the Yb3+:2F5/2 level to decrease. Moreover, due to the quenching of Yb3+ ions, the Er3+:4I13/2 emission reaches a maximum and then decreases.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum excited at 380 nm was measured and is shown in Fig. 6 and compared with the UCL spectrum. In the PL measurements, 380 nm was selected to excite the Er3+:4G11/2 level, from which the excitation subsequently relaxes to the (2H11/2, 4S3/2) levels.21 We find that the red emission of the Er3+:4F9/2 level in the UCL spectrum was dramatically enhanced compared with the PL spectrum. Under excitation at 380 nm, the population of the 4F9/2 level can only originate from its upper levels (2H11/2, 4S3/2) through multiphonon relaxation (MPR). In the UCL mechanism, the population of the 4F9/2 level has three other possible routes, except for MPR from its upper levels.

(a) Excited-state absorption (ESA).
Er3+:4I15/2 → Er3+:4I11/2 (GSA), Er3+:4I11/2 → Er3+:4I13/2 (MPR), Er3+:4I13/2 → Er3+:4F9/2 (ESA).
(b) Two-step energy transfer up-conversion (ET).
The first step: Yb3+:2F5/2 + Er3+:4I15/2 → Yb3+:2F7/2 + Er3+:4I11/2
Er3+:4I11/2 → Er3+:4I13/2 (MPR).
The second step: Yb3+:2F5/2 + Er3+:4I13/2 → Yb3+:2F7/2 + Er3+:4F9/2.
At low 980 nm excitation densities, the ET up-conversion from the lower intermediate 4I13/2 state is generally considered dominant for the population of the 4F9/2 level in the Yb3+ and Er3+ co-doped system. Therefore, the UCL red emission reaches its strongest when the Yb3+:2F5/2 emission and Er3+:4I13/2 emission reach a maximum for a Yb3+ concentration of 5%.
(c) The non-MPR mechanism for populating the Er3+:4F9/2 level from the (2H11/2, 4S3/2) levels. The mechanism involves a cross relaxation (CR) ET: Er3+:(2H11/2, 4S3/2) + Yb3+:2F7/2 → Er3+:4I13/2 + Yb3+:2F5/2; then, an energy back transfer: Yb3+:2F5/2 + Er3+:4I13/2 → Yb3+:2F7/2 + Er3+:4F9/2 is involved. The CRB mechanism promotes the excitation of the Er3+:4F9/2 level and takes place only at the nearest Er3+–Yb3+ pair. Thus, it is fast and efficient at low excitation densities.14
The observation of a very strong red emission in the UCL and a very weak red emission in the PL spectra indicate that the MPR process is inefficient for the population of the Er3+:4F9/2 level under excitation at 380 nm and that the Er3+:4F9/2 level was populated predominantly by the ET, ESA, and CRB routes in the UCL processes, as shown schematically in the energy level diagrams shown in Fig. 7. The CRB process in this case takes place within the same Er3+–Yb3+ pair and is independent of the excitation density, which is similar to the MPR. In fact, the CRB process under excitation at 380 nm was also present. However, it is much less efficient than that observed under excitation at 980 nm. This is because all of the Er3+ ions in the materials are excited under excitation at 380 nm. However, the Er3+ ions, which are far away from the Yb3+ ions, are useless for the CRB process. In contrast, only the Er3+ ions close to the Yb3+ ions are excited under excitation at 980 nm and they can all take part in the CRB process. Under excitation at 380 nm, the CRB process is very inefficient, and hence the red emission of the Er3+:4F9/2 level is very weak.

3.3. The pump power dependence of the emission intensities
In order to further understand the UC mechanism for populating the Er3+:(2H11/2, 4S3/2) and 4F9/2 levels under excitation at 980 nm, we measured the UCL spectra under different pump powers as shown in Fig. 8. For the UCL processes, the up-converted emission intensity (IUCL) depends on the pumping laser power (P) according to the following equation: I ∝ Pn, where n is the number of pumping photons absorbed per up-converted photon emitted.24 The n value can be determined from the slope of the linear plots between log(I) and log(P). The 980 nm pumping power dependence of the (2H11/2, 4S3/2) → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 emission intensities are plotted as double logarithmic scales in the inset of Fig. 8. The slope n values for the red and green UCL are 2.2 and 2.9 at a low pump power density, respectively. We found that the n values obtained are both larger than 2. Moreover, the n value for the green UCL was larger than that observed for the red UCL, indicating a faster growth of the green UCL than that of the red UCL upon increasing the pumping power. This indicates, except for the two-step process populated (2H11/2, 4S3/2) levels [Yb3+:2F5/2 + Er3+:4I11/2 → Yb3+:2F7/2 + Er3+:(2H11/2, 4S3/2)], a three-photon process was involved in the green UCL. This can be described as follows: Yb3+:2F5/2 + Er3+:4F9/2 → Yb3+:2F7/2 + Er3+:2H9/2, as shown in Fig. 7(b). The samples display the dominant red emission in the UCL spectrum of the sample prepared using the ST method shown in Fig. 3. The large population of the Er3+:4F9/2 level can increase the chances of the (2H11/2, 4S3/2) levels populated by the third step ET process. The n value for the green UCL was higher than 2. The population of the Er3+:4F9/2 level partly originates from the green emitting state (2H11/2, 4S3/2) levels; hence, the n value for the red UCL was slightly higher than 2. This phenomenon has also been observed in the nano-sized Lu2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ sample.21 At a high pump power density, the two slopes gradually reduce to 1 due to upconversion becoming dominant.25

3.4. Lifetime measurements
The temporal evolutions of the Er3+:4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (red) and Er3+:4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (green) UCL emissions under pulsed excitation at 980 nm of the Sc2O3:10%Yb3+,1%Er3+ sample are presented in Fig. 9(a). The decay times for the red and green emissions were calculated by integrating the area under the corresponding decay curves with the normalized initial intensity, reaching τd = 8.06 μs and 2.28 μs, respectively. For the green emission, the fast decay during the first few nanoseconds corresponds to the pulse of the optical parametrical oscillator (7 ns pulse) that could not be filtered completely due to the small signal intensity of the green emission. Fig. 9(b) and (c) show the intensity data at the short times for this sample on a linear scale, in comparison with that in the Yb3+-free Sc2O3:1%Er3+ sample. At the end of the excitation pulse, no luminescence intensity was observed for 4F9/2 and the transient exhibited a typical delayed rise and decay, as shown in Fig. 9(b). This is a clear indication of the ET up-conversion process. Fig. 9(c) shows that the 4S3/2 level has a fast and nearly instantaneous increase during the excitation pulse in addition to a delayed rise after the end of the excitation pulse, showing that both the ESA and ETU processes are involved in the 4S3/2 green level population. In addition, Fig. 9(b) and (c) show that the lifetimes for the green and red emissions in Sc2O3:10%Yb3+,1%Er3+ are longer than those measured in the Yb3+-free sample, which confirms that the ET up-conversion was obviously enhanced when co-doped with Yb3+ ions. The rise time for the green emission was shorter than that observed for the red emission. The short transient indicates the competition between the ESA process and ET up-conversion process.11 The lifetime of the Yb3+:2F5/2 level in the Sc2O3 sample reported in the literature was 232 μs.26 The decay lifetime values for the red and green emissions in the current work exhibit a great difference with this value. This may be due to the following reasons that induce the shorter decay lifetime values. First, both the ESA and ET up-conversion processes play an important role in the energy level populations in the ST-Sc2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ sample. Second, the nano-sized ST-Sc2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ sample has a relatively high surface area. Moreover, the Sc2O3 oxide host lattice has a high cut-off phonon frequency of about 625 cm−1.27 Both the abundant surface groups and high phonon frequency can efficiently enhance the non-radiative relaxation of the emission level. Third, the experimental samples have a relatively high Yb3+ co-doped concentration. The lifetimes of the Er3+:4S3/2 and 4F9/2 levels become shorter as the Yb3+ concentration increases, which is due to back ET from Er3+ to Yb3+ by the emission of phonons.28,29 The decay times of the Er3+:4F9/2 level were close to those of the Er3+:4S3/2 level, meaning the population of the Er3+:4F9/2 level partly originates from the green emitting Er3+:4S3/2 state mainly through the CRB process under excitation at 980 nm.

4. Conclusions
Pure cubic Sc2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ crystals were synthesized using a biphasic ST method at different annealing temperatures (600, 700, and 800 °C) for 2 h. Compared with the bulk Sc2O3 powders prepared via an SS method, the ST-Sc2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ sample possesses a lower synthesis temperature and small size. The intense red UCL in the ST-Sc2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ sample has been observed upon laser diode pumping at 980 nm. Compared with that in the bulk sample synthesized via the SS reaction at the same sintering temperature (700 °C), the green and red UCL were enhanced by a factor of 19.7 and 23.4, respectively. The relatively enhanced red intensity of the sample prepared using the ST method at 700 °C for 2 h was up to 6.6 times that obtained using the SS reaction method at 1600 °C for 6 h. Furthermore, the optical properties of the Sc2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ oxide crystals in the visible-light and infrared regions were investigated in detail as a function of the dopant concentrations. The Sc2O3:5%Yb3+,1%Er3+ sample was optimized to obtain the highest UCL intensity.
The spectral distribution, power dependence and lifetime measurements reveal that the UCL mechanisms involved in the Sc2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ crystals. In the UCL process, the red emission of the Er3+:4F9/2 level was populated via three possible routes, i.e. excited-state absorption (ESA), two-step ET up-conversion, and non-MPR mechanism from the (2H11/2, 4S3/2) by CRB. For the green up-conversion of the Er3+:(2H11/2, 4S3/2) level, a three-photon process occurs in the Sc2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ crystals, which can be described as Yb3+:2F5/2 + Er3+:4F9/2 → Yb3+:2F7/2 + Er3+:2H9/2. The lifetimes of the green and red emissions for Yb3+ and Er3+ co-doped Sc2O3 sample are longer than those measured in the Yb3+-free sample, indicating the existence of enhanced ET up-conversion in the co-doped sample. Due to competition between the ET process and ESA up-conversion process, the rise time for the green emission was shorter than that found for the red emission. The decay time of the green emission was close to that of the red emission, declaring that the CRB process was subsistent in the population of the Er3+:4F9/2 level partly originating from the Er3+:(2H11/2, 4S3/2) levels.
