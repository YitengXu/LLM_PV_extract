    , Accepted 21st December 2020First published on 22nd December 2020AbstractMetal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline porous materials with a broad range of practical applications. A plethora of MOFs based on a variety of metal ions including s-, p-, d-, and f-block elements have been developed over the past decade. Despite the abundance, cheapness, and recognized non-toxicity, s-block MOFs are less explored than those of MOFs based on transition metals and f-block metal ions. Given that s-block MOFs adopt outstanding features (e.g., low density, dense Lewis active centers and open metal sites, biocompatibility, and high catalytic activity), they have been used for potential applications such as gas storage and separation, chemical delivery, catalysis, electrochemical applications, and sensing. This review includes the recent advances of s-block MOFs. The properties of MOFs based on s-block metal ions are the first aspect in our discussion; the second one is the description of the chemical structures of s-block MOF constituents including organic linkers and metal clusters; furthermore, the function of crystal structures and applications of s-block MOFs are specially addressed in gas sorption and separation, chemical delivery, catalysis, sensing, and others types of practical applications. Providing viewpoints on how to expand the scope of s-block MOF chemistry is considered as our final goal in an attempt to orient the chemistry, properties, applications, and future directions of s-block MOFs as advanced materials for multiple purposes in the future.Mohamed A.

1. Introduction
Adopting the intriguing features of architectural rigidity, high porosity, thermal and chemical stability, crystalline frameworks, and limitless structural functionalization, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising candidates for energy-related applications1–6—IUPAC identifies that one of ten innovations in chemistry7 that could change the world is using MOFs for water harvesting;8–14 the applicability of MOFs, however, is much further than that.15–22 The unified pore structures which can be decorated with targeted motifs by physical and/or chemical inclusion,23–25 the ability of organic linker functionalization without disturbing the structural topologies, and the chemical diversity of metal clusters26–28 (i.e. organic linkers and metal clusters are two components, termed secondary building units, or SBUs, that construct the hybrid frameworks of MOF materials) are what make MOFs interesting. Particularly, MOFs with hybrid functional structures are advanced platforms for catalysis,20–22 adsorption,29–31 magnetic applications,22,32 and sensing,19,33 to name a few.34–36
Metal-based clusters that MOF chemistry relies on are very diverse: MOF structures consist of organic linkers and almost all metals in the periodic table,37,38 including s-block metals, p- and d-block transition metals, and rare-earth elements. Owing to the pronounced characteristics of transition metals that include visible light absorption, multiple oxidation states, and various coordination geometries, MOFs based on p- and d-block elements are the most dominant. This has been proven by many well-established MOF structures consisting of clusters of Ti(IV),38–46 Zr(IV),47–52 Cr(III),53,54 Fe(III),55,56 Cu(II),57–59 Zn(II),60,61 and Al(III),62–64etc. Recently, attention has been paid to rare-earth (RE) MOFs65–71 due to the high coordination numbers of RE clusters leading to higher stability and fascinating structures with various topologies. In contrast to p-, d-, and f-block MOFs, MOFs made up of s-block main group elements, alkali and alkaline earth metals, have been less considered in both the fundamental and applied chemistry because of their low stability and most importantly, preconceived chemical features,72—i.e., the shortage of the formation of predictive structures and the challenge to reticulate those of active s-block metals into extended frameworks.73 As a result, research efforts, published articles from 1995 to date, on s-block MOFs only hold a small fraction of 1.02% compared to all MOFs (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Data showing the number of articles of s-block MOFs compared to all MOFs published from 1995 to date based on a Web of Science search, conducted on August 22, 2020. 
Despite the limited structures and difficulties in the structural formation of s-block MOFs originating from the unpredicted coordination behavior of metals in groups 1A and 2A, s-block MOFs adopt many distinctive, appealing, and intriguing features that are suited to many applications. In particular, s-block MOFs inherit the characteristics of s-block main group elements that have (1) naturally high abundance, making them inexpensive; (2) less toxicity, unlike the other MOFs based on transition metals, thus expanding their applicability in various fields, especially in biological processes; and (3) low density, one of the essential factors for gas sorption applications.72–74
In order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of s-block MOFs (e.g., the coordination behavior of metal clusters and crystal structures of MOFs that are formed by linking those of metal and organic SBUs) and their practical applications, we summarize the progress, the discoveries, and the uses of s-block MOFs (i.e., discussing the structural features, and interpreting the related applications of alkali- and alkaline-earth-based MOFs) in detail. We finally consider some research directions, as important as the discussion of the chemical features and applications of s-block MOFs, which help diversify and expand the scope of s-block MOFs for the design and synthesis of more complex structures.
2. Properties of s-block MOFs
Although MOFs based on s-block metals have been less considered, they afford several interesting properties:
(i) Some s-block metal ions such as Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Ba2+ present important biological properties.75 The biocompatibility makes the aforementioned metals attractive to design biocompatible MOFs.76,77 For instance, Ba is widely used as an X-ray contrast agent;78 therefore, linking such s-block metal ions with biocompatible linkers would be of great interest for medicinal applications.79
(ii) Low-density s-block metal ions (e.g., Li or Mg) can construct MOFs that possess low-density frameworks with a high surface area leading to increased gas uptake capacity.80 For instance, researchers used Li+ for gravimetric modification of MOFs that adopt promising gas sorption properties.81 Moreover, Mg-MOFs have been largely explored for selective CO2 capture and separation.82,83
(iii) MOFs constructed from s-block metals provide open metal sites (OMS) accomplished through elimination of coordinated solvent molecules for gas uptake enhancement. The requirement for using OMS-based MOFs for sorption is that the unsaturated frameworks must be stable and have to maintain permanent porosity after activation.84 Removal of such coordination centers, however, often comes at the cost of structural collapse and loss of porosity.85 In this context, post-synthetic metalation using s-block metals (i.e., doping Li) holds promise to solve such problems.86,87 Given the advantages afforded by Li and other alkali metals, scientists have applied the doping strategy using different alkali metals to MOFs to increase CO2, CH4, and H2 uptake capacity.88–91
(iv) Along with the OMS, structures of s-block MOFs often consist of infinite chain SBUs which are strong Lewis acidic centers. Such infinite SBUs not only enhance the gas uptake capacity but also promote organic transformations due to the dense catalytically active sites. Therefore, s-block MOFs are suitable for organic reactions requiring catalysts with Lewis acidic active centers such as C–C bond formation or cycloaddition of CO2.
These interesting properties will be discussed in detail in the application section.
3. Structural features of organic linkers of s-block MOFs
There are different synthetic approaches (e.g., slow diffusion, hydrothermal, and solvothermal methods) that yield various morphologies and structures of s-block MOFs. Among them, solvothermal synthesis is the most commonly used method.92 Although the restricted coordination of s-block metal ions limits their structural diversity,74 finding suitable conditions matching the coordination numbers of organic linkers and s-block elements (i.e., from 4 for Li to 12 for Cs) results in multiple architectural structures, as reported by Thuéry.93 In this study, tetracarboxylic acid, pyrazine tetracarboxylic acid, and bicyclo [2,2,2]oct-7-ene 2,3,5,6 tetracarboxylic acid were used to form various complex structures. This work indicates that multiple functional linkers will be likely dominant for the formation of s-block MOFs that present sophisticated structures with interesting properties (Fig. 2).

According to the hard soft acid base principle,94 s-block metal ions are hard metals. Consequently, they react with hard heteroatom-based organic linkers to form extended structures with ionic bonds in nature (Fig. 2). There are few reports of using organic linkers with soft atoms (e.g., N of pyridine and imidazole based on carboxylic acids)95,96 to construct extended frameworks with s-block metals. In these cases, s-block metals binding to soft atoms, mainly N-based carboxylate linkers, will generate more stable structures. As in the case of {[Sr(μ2-H2mPyMIDC)2(DMF)2]n·H2O}n,94 the versatile connectivity modes of the H3mPyMIDC linker (H3mPyMIDC stands for 2-(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-1H-imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid) to the metal ion facilitate the formation of a 3D chiral MOF consisting of two well-defined 1D helical chains. Apparently, the flexibility of the pyridinylmethyl group of the imidazole-based dicarboxylate linker with dihedral angles between imidazole and pyridyl rings in the range of 0–60° allows them to rotate freely around the C–C facilitating the MOF formation. The linker adopts a μ2-kN,O:kO' mode binding to two Sr2+ ions in a N,O-chelating monodentate fashion. This linkage makes the MOF structure rigid.
Most organic linkers in s-block MOFs are aromatic polycarboxylate anions whose bond strength with alkali (1A) and alkaline earth (2A) ions mainly leads to increased rigidity in s-block MOF structures.72 Particularly, the rigidity of s-block MOFs is based on the strong ionic interaction resulting from the large difference in electronegativity between the s-block metal ions and the donor atoms (e.g., carboxylate functional groups) of organic linkers (an exception is the Be ion which has the highest charge/radius ratio compared to other s-block elements, thus forming covalent bonds in Be-based extended structures).97 This type of bonding differs from that of MOFs based on p-, d- and f-block metal ions, in which diverse structures are formed by covalent bonds.98,99 Limited development of s-block elements as metal centers for MOFs is attributed to their instability in air and aqueous medium. Once exposed to air, M–O bonds, M stands for s-block metals, adsorb moisture and form M–OH species, hence protonating the bond and thereby destroying the MOF structure. The hydrolytic behavior is prone to be faster in aqueous medium, especially under various pH conditions. This is caused by the high electronegativity and ionic nature of the metal centers with their carboxylate oxygen atoms. It is thus difficult to exert control over s-block MOF coordination geometry which is determined by the orientation of these functional groups.73,100–103 For applications including desalination, separation of organic molecules, drug delivery, and proton conduction, among others, there is an inevitable need for high stability of the MOF in an aqueous environment. MOF-74-Mg for instance losses 80–90% of its original porous structure when exposed to water at 95% relative humidity (RH).104 A similar trend is observed in carbonate-based electrolyte medium in which small metal ions like Li suffer instability which notably hinders their development as electrode materials for batteries.105
Thermal stability, which is essential in gas adsorption and separation applications, however, is comparatively high among s-block MOFs. The large radius coupled with high electronegativity increases thermal stability behavior in s-block MOFs with most of them having Td (decomposition temperature) values of ca. 400 °C, if not above.101,102 This robust property makes s-block MOFs stable for gas uptake studies similar to other MOFs. Similarly, in a nonpolar chemical environment, s-block MOFs exhibit higher stability due to the M–O bonds which are strong enough not to be hydrolyzed by such nonpolar solvents and high charge density as well as the large ionic size that accounts for the larger coordination environment. Therefore, finding the way to implement strong linkages into rigid s-block MOF structures is essential for enhancing the stability of resulting frameworks and further expanding the chemistry and applications of s-block MOFs—the last section in this review, future perspectives, covers this encounter.
4. Structural diversity of SBUs of s-block MOFs
In this section, we selectively outline some emerging metal clusters of s-block MOFs (clusters of Li-, Na-, Mg-, Ca-, and Ba-MOFs) which were reported in the literature without considering applications. In the next section, applications of s-block MOFs, we will comprehensively and interpretatively discuss the interplay between s-block MOF structures, including metal clusters and connectivity of linkers, and their applicability.
4.1. Li-based clusters
In s-block metals, Li is the lightest element normally crystallizing in the tetrahedral geometry, as found in Li4(L1)2(H2O)(DMF)2 (L1 = 4,4′-(dimethylsilanediyl)dibenzoic acid; DMF = N,N′-dimethylformamide), termed IMP-22 and reported by Pugh et al.106 In this MOF structure, there are two distinctive subunits of SBUs: the first subunit (Fig. 3a) is a tricyclic consisting of the central 8-membered ring (Li2O4C2) which connects to two 4-membered rings (Li2O2); the second subunit is the Li6O16C6 cluster formed by six carboxylate functionalities, linked to six Li cations, and two coordinated solvent molecules (water and DMF; Fig. 3b). Although Li-MOFs with SBUs that adopt alternating octa- and tetra-cyclic rings have been reported,72 IMP-22 is the first Li-MOF possessing tricyclic SBUs, in which Li+ polyhedra are tethered by carboxylate-functional groups (Fig. 3c).

4.2. Na-based clusters
Na2(L1)(DMF)2, denoted by IMP-23, is an isoreticular structure of IMP-22.106 Both IMP-22 and IMP-23 feature 1D rod-like SBUs. Particularly, IMP-23 has two crystallographically independent Na+ ions. Each Na+ ion is a 6-coordinate unit formed by four carboxylate groups (one of which binds to the Na atom in a bidentate chelating mode, and the other three carboxylate moieties link to the Na atom in a monodentate chelating fashion) and one DMF solvent molecule. Unlike IMP-23, IMP-25 with unique 3D SBUs comprises the H3L2 linker (H3L2 = 4,4′,4′′-(methylsilanetriyl)tribenzoic acid) and Na+ ions surrounded by the distinctive coordination environment: Na+ ions connect to oxygen atoms of the carboxylate linkers in a 3D arrangement of continuous triangular channels (Fig. 4a).
 Fig. 4  Structures of SBUs in Na-based MOFs. (a) 3D arrangement of the SBUs of IMP-25. (b) SBU structure of IMP-26. (c) Repeatable SBU of IMP-27Na crystallizing in an infinite chain. Atom colors: Na, aqua and orange; C, gray; O, red. H atoms are omitted for clarity. 
H3L2 also reacts with Na+ ions to form IMP-26, formulated as Na42(L2)14(H2O)3. IMP-26 is constructed by parallel penetrated 1D Na+ SBUs arranged in a 3D architecture (Fig. 4b).
The reaction between NaNO3 and H4L3 (H4L3 corresponds to 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-silanetetrayltetrabenzoic acid) leads to the formation of IMP-27Na, formulated as Na4(L3)(DMF)4(H2O)4. The structure of IMP-27Na is made up of H4L3 and infinite Na+ chains formed by repeating two alternating building units. One unit consists of three plane- and edge-sharing Na polyhedra; the other unit consists of two identical edge-sharing Na polyhydra. The two units are bridged through carboxylate functionalities and solvent molecules (Fig. 4c).106
4.3. Mg-based clusters
Wöhlbrandt and co-workers reported the synthesis and characterization of [Mg(H5L4)(H2O)2]·H2O (H5L4 = 4-{[bis(phosphonomethyl)amino]methyl}benzenesulfonic acid).107 In the [Mg(H5L4)(H2O)2]·H2O structure, each Mg2+ connects to six oxygen atoms, four of them are from three H3L2− linkers binding to Mg2+ through the phosphonate groups and the other two are from coordinated water molecules. These connections form a MgO6 polyhedron (Fig. 5a). Each linker connects to three Mg2+ ions (Fig. 5b) and the H-bonding is formed by the third water molecule located among the linear chains.

Atom colors: Mg, aqua; C, gray; O, red; N, blue; S, yellow; P, orange. H atoms are omitted for clarity. 
Formed by different synthetic routes, [Mg(H3L)(H2O)2]·H2O and [Mg2(HL)(H2O)6]·2H2O were reported by the same research group.107 The structure of [Mg2(HL)(H2O)6]·2H2O SBU is presented in Fig. 5c. Two edge-sharing Mg1 polyhedra are located at the center of the cluster crystallizing in the same coordinative environment: each Mg1 connects to two different phosphonate-functional linkers and three water molecules. Moreover, the two Mg2 ions also display a symmetrically coordinative environment similar to Mg1 atoms where each Mg2 is 6-coordinated: one phosphonate-based linker and five water molecules. Fig. 5d presents the coordinative environment of the Mg2+ polyhedra. In this MOF, the non-coordinating water molecules also participate in the H-bonding formation.
4.4. Ca-based clusters
Ca-based clusters in s-block MOFs usually crystallize in infinite chains with various coordination numbers. For example, Asha et al.108 reported a Ca-based MOF, formulated as [H2N(CH3)2[Ca7(BTB)5(H2O)8(DMF)4]·4H2O (BTB = 1,3,5-benzenetribenzoic acid). In this MOF, Ca2+ ions adopt various coordination numbers: Ca1 connects to seven oxygen atoms to form a CaO7 polyhedral structure; Ca2, in the form of a CaO9 polyhedron, bonds to nine oxygen atoms. The other two Ca2+ ions, Ca3 and Ca4, crystallize in the distorted octahedral shape. BTB linkers connect to Ca2+ ions to yield a 3D structure, in which Ca2+ ions are tethered via Ca–O–Ca bonds in the form of infinite zigzag patterns (Fig. 6).

Another Ca-based MOF with infinite rod-like SBUs, termed Ca(DHBq)(H2O)2(H2DHBq = 2,5-dihydroxybenzoquinone), was reported by Sumida et al.109 In the SBUs of Ca(DHBq)(H2O)2, each Ca2+ links to six oxygen atoms of DHBq2− organic linkers and two water molecules to form an 8-coordinate unit. Four DHBq2− moieties bind directly to the Ca2+ metal center: one in chelating coordination and the other three carboxylate functionalities link to adjacent Ca2+ cations to yield a zigzag 1D SBU (Fig. 7). The formed polyhedra connect to each other through the opposite ends of the DHBq2− linkers. As a result, diamond-shaped cavities are generated.

4.5. Ba-based clusters
Ba-oxo clusters are quite similar to Ca-based clusters but they tend to crystallize in a layer-by-layer fashion. In the first example, a Ba-MOF, formulated as C24H14O24Ba5·7H2O and termed BM,110 was reported by Rajendrababu and co-workers. In this structure, Ba atoms linked to maleic acid (MA) linkers crystallize in three different coordinative geometries, namely Ba1, Ba2, and Ba3 corresponding to 10-, 12-, and 8-coordinated units, respectively (Fig. 8a). In the asymmetric unit, one carboxylate group of MA chelates to Ba1 and the other carboxylate group of the linker is free. The second MA linker connects to Ba atoms through two carboxylate functional groups where one carboxylate group connects to Ba1 in a monodentate fashion. Additionally, the opposite carboxylate moiety links to Ba1, Ba2, and Ba3 in a bidentate fashion. The third MA linker acts as a monodentate coordinating to Ba3 from one end while the another end links to Ba1, Ba2, and Ba3 in a tridentate fashion. The 2D structure of C24H14O24Ba5·7H2O, presented in Fig. 8b is built from coordinated water molecules that form intermolecular H-bonding with oxygens of lattice water molecules and nearby carboxylate groups. This intermolecular H-bonding configuration stabilizes the C24H14O24Ba5·7H2O structure.

In the second example, Tang et al.111 synthesized two Ba-based MOFs, [Ba(2,5-PZDC)(H2O)4]·2H2O and Ba(2,5-PZDC)(H2O)2 (2,5-PZDC = 2,5-pyrazinedicarboxylic acid), using different Ba sources. The two MOFs have different crystal structures; Ba2+ ions in both MOFs adopt different coordinative environments. Particularly, in [Ba(2,5-PZDC)(H2O)4]·2H2O, Ba2+ is a 10-coordinate unit formed by connections of four water molecules, two oxygens from the carboxylate moiety, and two nitrogen atoms from the pyridine-based units. The square-planar edge-sharing mode is found in the two adjacent Ba2+ ions and each Ba2+ ion crystallizes in the binuclear geometry. The two Ba2+ units are tethered by oxo atoms to form the infinite SBU (Fig. 9a). Similar to [Ba(2,5-PZDC)(H2O)4]·2H2O, Ba(2,5-PZDC)(H2O)2 has one crystallographically independent Ba2+ ion which is 10-coordinated. This Ba atom links to four carboxylate-based linkers through the chelating modes (i.e., two linkers are monodentate) and four water molecules (Fig. 9b). Each Ba2+ shares edges with four surrounded metal polyhedra to form the 2D layer structure (Fig. 9c).

In the last example, Ba-oxo clusters feature 1D chains. Particularly, Wöhlbrandt et al. reported a Ba-MOF, formulated as [Ba(H3L4)(H2O)]·H2O,107 using tritopic linker H5L4 (H5L4 corresponds to 4-{[bis(phosphonomethyl)amino]methyl}benzenesulfonic acid). This special linker with multiple binding sites connects to four monocapped square antiprism BaO9 polyhedra. Two of the polyhedra are linked by the sulfate anions, and the other two polyhedra are tethered by two different phosphate groups (Fig. 10a). Each BaO9 polyhedron shares edges with the adjacent BaO9 unit, thus giving rise to the zigzag 1D SBU (Fig. 10b) which combines with the sulfonate and phosphate groups of the organic linkers to generate the 3D MOF structure (Table 1).

5. Applications of s-block MOFs
The potential applications of s-block MOFs in gas storage and separation are based on permanent porosity and OMS. Meanwhile the shape, size, functionality of pore structures, and active metal sites mainly correspond to catalytic applications. Most importantly, the biocompatibility of s-block MOFs makes them attractive platforms for chemical/drug delivery and medicinal applications. The following sections describe the interplay between the structures and most common applications of s-block MOFs in detail.
5.1. Adsorption of gases and small molecules
Using MOFs for gas sorption and small molecule uptake has been successfully achieved.1,112 The uptake of small molecules using s-block MOFs, however, has been explored recently by Yan et al. reporting a Ca-based MOF, made up of the H3BTC (H3BTC = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid) linker and Ca clusters and formulated as [Ca(HBTC)(H2O)]·2H2O.99 [Ca(HBTC)(H2O)]·2H2O exhibited linear zigzag SBUs which link to the organic linkers to generate open pores with a dimension of 7.9 × 5.6 Å. There is only one distinctive Ca2+ ion in the asymmetric unit and this Ca2+ bonds to eight oxygen atoms: seven of them, in two different binding modes, belong to five different carboxylate linkers and the other one is from the water molecule. The resulting polyhedra share edges to form 1D zigzag SBUs. Each Ca2+ in the chain coordinates to three BTC linkers to generate the [Ca(H2O)(BTC)3] chain which further connects to the other six chains via BTC linkers to form a 3D network with solvent accessible pores. This MOF exhibited high thermal stability and retained the structural framework intact after activation; therefore, it was studied for the removal of Hg0 at 150 °C. Nevertheless, about 50% of Hg0 was reduced after 50 min, and the concentration of Hg0 was raised again after 75 min. The observed poor adsorption ability of [Ca(HBTC)(H2O)]·2H2O was attributed to its small pores.
The second example of using s-block MOFs for small molecule uptake is credited to Mandal et al.113 who synthesized a Ba-MOF, formulated as [Ba3(C9H3O6)2(H2O)4]·2H2O denoted by 1-B. [Ba3(C9H3O6)2(H2O)4]·2H2O is based on mixed linkers, H3BTC and BIA (H3BTC = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid; BIA = 5-boronoisopthalic acid). The 3D framework of [Ba3(C9H3O6)2(H2O)4]·2H2O consists of trimeric Ba-based SBUs linked to BTC3− linkers. [Ba3(C9H3O6)2(H2O)4]·2H2O was examined for its applicability in adsorption of cis-diol compounds including glucose, galactose, mannose, and xylose. Boric acid was added to substitute some of the BTC ligands in the MOF structure to create defects, thus, improving the adsorption affinity between the MOF and cis-diol compounds. The adsorption studies of cis-diol compounds decreased in the order of galactose > glucose > mannose > xylose. The MOF regeneration, however, was hindered by its instability in acidic medium.
It should be noted that there are very few studies that report the use of s-block MOFs for the uptake of organic compounds, Hg0 removal, and environmental applications. This limitation is mainly due to the stability and porosity of s-block MOFs, both must be improved for such kinds of applications.
Despite the limited applicability in the removal of molecular complexes, s-block MOFs show promising properties in gas sorption.
First, Koner and co-workers114 reported two 3D MOFs, formulated as [Ca2Na2(CA)2(H2O)6]n·nH2O and [Sr3(CA)2(H2O)9]n·2nH2O (CA = chelidamic acid). [Ca2Na2(CA)2(H2O)6]n·nH2O consists of CA linkers and repeated dinuclear SBUs having two crystallographically independent Ca2+ ions. The two Ca polyhedra (dinuclear units) crystallize in the edge-sharing form of Ca2O2. The dinuclear unit links to four 1D chains of Na-oxo clusters (Fig. 11a). Each Na+ links to four bridging oxygen atoms from two carboxylate linkers connecting the adjacent Na+ ions to form the 1D chain. The 3D framework is further generated by the interconnection between the Na+ chains through dinuclear Ca2+ units; and each dinuclear Ca2+ connects to four Ca2O2 units in various directions via the phenolate and carboxylate oxygens.

(a) Dimeric Ca-based SBU structure of [Ca2Na2(CA)2(H2O)6]n·nH2O, connected to four 1D Na-oxo clusters and the organic linkers. (b) Structure of 1D Sr-based SBU of [Sr3(CA)2(H2O)9]n·2nH2O. Atom colors: Ca and Sr, aqua; Na, orange; C, gray; O, red; N, blue. H atoms are omitted for clarity. 
As for the [Sr3(CA)2(H2O)9]n·2nH2O 3D MOF, it is constructed from 1D Sr-based SBUs. The chain SBU comprises alternating dinuclear units of Sr2 (Sr2O3) and mononuclear Sr1 (Sr1 and Sr2 are connected through oxygen atoms of the carboxylate linkers) (Fig. 11b). Each Sr2 coordinates to two oxygen atoms from the carboxylate linker and four 1D chains through the phenolate and carboxylate to form a 3D framework. The activated Ca- and Sr-MOF exhibit high sorption capacity for H2 (ca. 1.6 wt% for the Ca-MOF and 1.1 wt% for the S-MOF) and CO2 (ca. 13 wt% at 298 K for the Ca-MOF and 19.4 wt% at 298 K for the Sr-MOF) at 1 atm. Particularly, [Sr3(L)2(H2O)9]n·2nH2O shows higher H2 uptake than the other ascribed to its high surface area (1857 m2 g−1) and the presence of OMS. Moreover, the high uptake of both MOFs was attributed to the high surface area of the MOFs and the strong quadruple interaction between CO2 molecules and OMS.2
Second, Plonka et al.115 synthesized two Ca-based MOFs, termed SBMOF-1 (Ca(SDB); SDB = 4,4′-sulfonyldibenzoate) and SBMOF-2 (Ca(TCPB); TCPB = 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)benzene) and further explored the applicability of the aforementioned MOFs for the sorption of hydrogen carbons. The Ca2+ ion in SBMOF-1 is 6-coordinated to oxygen atoms and crystallizes in octahedral geometry. Five of the coordinated oxygen atoms are from five different carboxylate groups and one from the sulfite group. Interestingly, joining the zigzag SBUs with the v-shaped SDB linkers leads to the formation of an extended MOF structure, adopting diamond-shaped channels (Fig. 12). Likewise, the SBU of SBMOF-2 is formed by hexa-coordinated Ca2+ cations. Unlike SBMOF-1, the Ca2+ ion in SBMOF-2 coordinates to six oxygen atoms from six different carboxylate groups. The 3D structure of SBMOF-2 is made up of octahedral CaO6 clusters with a half deprotonated TCPB linker with diamond-shaped channels similar to SBMOF-1 (Fig. 12). Both SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 were examined for the adsorption of CH4 and C2H6. In addition, SBMOF-2 was studied for C3H8, CH2CHCH3, and C4H10 sorption. The gas uptake isotherms were measured at 273, 278, 288, and 298 K under the standard atmospheric pressure. SBMOF-1 exhibited a moderate adsorption for C2Hn at 298 K, whereas for CH4, SBMOF-1 showed a lower adsorption capacity under the same conditions. The difference in adsorption uptake of CH4 and C2Hn is ascribed to the electrostatic interaction of C2 gases with the pore surface of SBMOF-1 which is higher than those of CH4. SBMOF-2 showed higher C2Hn uptake than SBMOF-1 at the identical temperature and pressure. Furthermore, SBMOF-2 was also tested for the uptake of C3 and nC4 gases, exhibiting a saturation of longer chain hydrocarbons at low pressures.

The third example is a Ca-based MOF, [Ca2L(DMF)2]·2DMF (Ca-SBF; L = 9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetracarboxylic acid) assembled from tetranuclear Ca-oxo clusters by Duan et al.116 In this structure, there are two crystallographically independent Ca2+ ions (each Ca2+ coordinates to seven atoms): Ca1 ion adopts a distorted capped octahedron, while Ca2 presents a distorted pentagonal–bipyramidal geometry. The two ions are joined in the edge-sharing mode to form the zigzag chain SBU. The chain clusters connect to each other through eight linkers; each linker bridges to four different clusters through the carboxylate anion crystallizing in μ2–η1:η1 and μ2–η2:η1 modes (Fig. 13a). The Ca-SBF crystals undergo a single-to-single transformation in methanol and a new structure, formulated as [Ca2L(CH3OH)2(H2O)2]·CH3OH·4H2O and denoted by Ca-SBF-1 (Fig. 13b), was formed. Ca-SBF-1 has two crystallography independent Ca2+ ions: Ca1 crystallizes in a distorted octahedral geometry, and Ca2 crystallizes in a distorted dodecahedral shape. Ca-SBF with a microporous structure exhibits a characteristic of Type I isotherm presenting an uptake of 44.9 cm3 g−1 CO2 at 1 bar and 273 K and 35 cm3 g−1 at 298 K (Table 2). Although this Ca-SBF has a lower surface area than the previously reported SBF MOFs,117–119 it possesses higher CO2 uptake capacity.117 The isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) of Ca-SBF (16.6 kJ mol−1) represents a moderate interaction between the MOF framework and CO2 molecules at low gas coverage.

The chemical properties of MOFs arise from the structural designs through functionalized linkers and metal SBUs. Targeting the infinite rod-like chain SBUs of MOFs, Hou et al.120 designed a linker, N,N′-bis(isophthalic acid)-oxalamide (H3BDPO), having four carboxylate functional groups and one Lewis basic functionality—the dual linking unit perfectly coordinates with oxophilic Ba2+ ions to generate an oxalamide-functionalized MOF with promising active sites for gas adsorption and catalytic applications. Particularly, a honeycomb-like 3D MOF, {[Ba2(BDPO)(H2O)]·DMA}n, featuring Ba2+ rod SBUs and having both exposed Lewis basic and acidic sites at the surface of hexagonal channels, was synthesized (Fig. 14). Remarkably, the generated hexagonal channels (8.2 Å) with the infinite rod SBUs enhance the rigidity and inhibit the interpenetration of {[Ba2(BDPO)(H2O)]·DMA}n. The pore channels bear amine functionalities at the surface and OMS in the backbone. This MOF displayed a high CO2 uptake capacity of 134.7 and 93.8 cm3 cm−3 at 273 and 298 K, respectively, the highest value reported for Ba-based MOFs121–123 (Table 2). The Qst was calculated to be 32.4 kJ mol−1 representing a high binding affinity toward CO2 molecules. CH4 uptake was also studied for {[Ba2(BDPO)(H2O)]·DMA}n exhibiting a low uptake capacity at 1 atm and 298 K (19.1 cm3 cm−3). The significant CO2 uptake was ascribed to the oxalamide units and OMS which generate strong dipole–quadrupole interaction with CO2 (4.30 × 10−26 esu cm2). In addition, CO2 has a polarizability value of 29.1 × 10−25 cm3 which is higher than that of CH4 (25.9 × 10−25 cm3). These factors indicate that {[Ba2(BDPO)(H2O)]·DMA}n selectively captures CO2 over CH4 at 1 atm, surpassing both JUC-199 and UiO-66.124,125 Moreover, {[Ba2(BDPO)(H2O)]·DMA}n can adsorb C2H6 and C2H4 with a sufficient uptake of 96.6 cm3 cm−3 for C2H6 and 103.9 cm3 cm−3 for C2H4 at 273 K.

As discussed above, s-block MOFs show poor structural stability due to the ionic metal–linker bonds prone to react with atmospheric water. In this context, Vitillo et al.104 used an approach that relies on the removal of adsorbed solvent to study the Mg2(DOBPDC) stability. Air stability tests for Mg2(DOBPDC) with coordinated solvent (sol-MOF) and activated Mg2(DOBPDC) (act-MOF) were conducted under different humidity conditions, 25–50% RH (indoor) and >86% RH (humid) at 22–25 °C for 24 h. Especially, the surface area of most of the MOF samples reduced by >80% compared to the pristine samples (the samples before conducting the stability test). Interestingly, the act-MOF under the indoor conditions was stable and retained its surface area. The sol-MOF under the humid conditions showed higher structural stability than the sol-MOF under the indoor conditions. This is attributed to the high RH which suppresses the evaporation process of solvent molecules residing in the pores of MOFs, thus maintaining its structural integrity. Unexpectedly, the MOF with the highest degree of structural loss exhibits a high CO2 uptake capacity, 60% higher than that of the theoretical value (only 10%). This interesting behavior is related to the maintained Mg2+ open sites (30% of Mg2+ sites was damaged) with which CO2 molecules highly interact.
Along with the use of OMS, linkers with basic active sites can be introduced into MOF structures to enhance the affinity with adsorbates. Tanase et al.111 applied this strategy to synthesize five MOFs based on three different alkaline earth metal ions and 2,5-pyrazinedicarboxylic acid (2,5-PZDC). Especially, the 2,5-PZDC linker with two electron donor groups allows the formation of hydrophilic MOFs with high thermal stability and selective binding sites toward H2O molecules. The resulting MOFs, [Ca(2,5-PZDC)(H2O)2]·H2O, Ca(2,5-PZDC)(H2O)4, [Sr(2,5-PZDC)(H2O)4]·H2O, [Ba(2,5-PZDC)(H2O)4·2H2O], and Ba(2,5-PZDC)(H2O)2, adopt 3D structures with hydrophilic 1D channels occupied with H2O molecules. [Ca(2,5-PZDC)(H2O)2]·H2O contains one crystallographically independent Ca2+ ion, two 2,5-PZDC2− linkers, two coordinated water, and one lattice water molecule (Fig. 15a). The 2,5-PZDC2− linkers coordinate to the Ca2+ ions in two different modes: one to six and one to two Ca2+ ions (Fig. 15b, c). These Ca2+ ions connect to each other via 2,5-PZDC2− moieties, giving rise to 1D channels.

(c) Binding mode of 2,5-PZDC2− linkers coordinating to six Ca2+ ions. Atom colors: Ca, aqua; C, gray; O, red; N, blue. H atoms are omitted for clarity. 
[Ca(2,5-PZDC)(H2O)2]·H2O and [Sr(2,5-PZDC)(H2O)4]·H2O were chosen to further study the water uptake ability. The water uptake measurements were conducted for the as-synthesized MOFs and activated MOFs (at 100 °C to remove guest H2O molecules from the MOF structures). The as-synthesized [Ca(2,5-PZDC)(H2O)2]·H2O showed 3.96 wt% water uptake capacity, indicating that each metal ion is capable of adsorbing a half water molecule. The activated MOF, however, showed a lower water uptake of 0.9 wt% attributed to the irreversible change in the MOF structure because the coordinated water molecules were removed causing the distortion of the hydrophilic 1D channels. [Sr(2,5-PZDC)(H2O)4]·H2O, however, exhibited an opposite trend. In particular, the activated MOF adsorbed more H2O (4.8 wt%) than the as-synthesized form (2.16 wt%). This is because the crystalline framework of the activated MOF was maintained after activation, resulting in reversible coordination with H2O molecules.

5.2. Chemical/drug delivery
The uses of MOFs to entrap and deliver compounds for specific purposes (e.g., chemical delivery, drug carriers) have been extensively studied126,127 thanks to the high porosity, strong host–guest interaction, and well-defined pore structures of MOFs. Furthermore, owing to the high degree of flexibility—structural customization has been controlled at the molecular level—MOFs can be appropriately tailored to incapsulate and deliver specific compounds under targeted conditions. For instance, Auras et al. synthesized CDMOF-a and CDMOF-b consisting of potassium precursors and gamma cyclodextrin units (γ-CDs). Both structures showed a hydrophilic interior and hydrophobic exterior.128 Especially, CDMOF-a and CDMOF-b can encapsulate acetaldehyde–acetaldehyde is a water-soluble material, volatile, highly reactive and toxic—and its release can precisely be controlled. Indeed, CDMOF-b with the γ-CD backbone exhibited better encapsulation and release of acetaldehyde than CDMOF-a and previously reported CD-MOFs.129 This behavior was attributed to the aldol self-condensation reaction occurring in the pores of CDMOF-b bearing the residual hydroxide ions. The encapsulation of acetaldehyde in CDMOF-a, however, resulted in a formation of residual products that was indicated by a color change.
Similar to CD-MOFs, the applications of s-block MOFs for biochemical applications rely on their nontoxicity and biocompatibility of metals, especially Ca and Sr. For example, Joseph et al.130 synthesized a mixed metal CaSr-MOF made up of trimesic acid and Ca and Sr clusters. The CaSr-MOF was investigated for in vivo delivery of Ca and Sr osteoinductive metals to enhance bone regeneration. This study also revealed that the CaSr-MOF could induce in vitro biomineralization from pre-osteoblastic MC3T3 cells and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Additionally, CaSr-MOFs were capable of encapsulating dimethyloxalylglycine and inducing the production of vascular endothelial cells from hMSCs.
Furthermore, Sun, Wang, and co-workers reported the synthesis of MOF@CaP,131 a biodegradable nanoscale Mg-gallate core encapsulated by a calcium phosphate (CaP) nanostructured shell, for drug delivery. The CaP shell reduces the degradation of the Mg-MOF core and allows the MOF composite to encapsulate bioactive entities that can be released under low pH conditions. Particularly, MOF@CaP releases the inflammatory microenvironment stimuli-responsive to the anti-inflammatory bioactive protein cytokine interleukin 4 (IL4). MOF@CaP nanoparticles were mixed with a collagen solution (Col) to prepare the MOF@CaP/Col composite. The in vivo study within a period of eight weeks showed that cranial bone defects in IL4-MOF@CaP/Col were successfully recovered to a nearly indistinguishable state compared with the early state of injury.
It is undoubtable that the biocompatibility of alkali and alkaline earth metals makes them attractive to build MOF systems for potential biomedical applications as discussed in several examples mentioned above. In addition, Sr is a non-toxic metal and plays a vital role in human tissue (e.g., bone). It has positive effects on bone stabilization that can stimulate osteoblast differentiation and prevent osteoclast formation and resorption.132 Moreover, Sr lessens cartilage degeneration and chondrocyte apoptosis on the osteoarthritis therapy.133,134 Studies have shown that Sr not only efficiently reduces inflammation but also relieves pain caused by osteoarthritis.135–137 In this context, Tang and co-workers138 reported the synthesis of the Sr/HCOOH-MOF and tested its activity for ketoprofen (an anti-inflammatory drug) release. Particularly, loading and releasing experiments showed that only 3% ketoprofen was loaded and nearly 80% was released within 8 h. It was noticed that there was a rapid increase at the beginning of the period of 8 h attributed to ketoprofen being close to the surface and cage walls. Following the rapid release, a slower release between 12 and 36 h was indicative of a release of ketoprofen from smaller pores and the release was stopped after 36 h when the framework collapsed.
Moreover, the anti-inflammatory effect of the Sr/HCOOH-MOF was studied for the in vitro qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) detection technique of three inflammation-related genes: IL-1β, iNOS, and RANKL, proving the promising applicability of the Sr/HCOOH-MOF in osteoarthritis treatment.

5.3. Catalysis
Like other MOFs adopting permanent porosity and catalytically active sites, s-block MOFs are capable of promoting organic transformation. In this section, we highlight the application of s-block MOFs for organic synthesis by exploiting the OMS or Lewis acidic sites.
The catalytic activities of the previously mentioned [Ca2Na2(CA)2(H2O)6]n·nH2O and [Sr3(CA)2(H2O)9]n·2nH2O were evaluated by Koner and co-workers.114 The dehydrated forms of the two MOFs are unique, have higher surface area, and contain more OMS than the hydrated structures. Therefore, the catalytic activity of [Ca2Na2(CA)2(H2O)6]n·nH2O and [Sr3(CA)2(H2O)9]n·2nH2O was evaluated for hydrogenation of styrene under mild conditions (60 °C, 1 atm H2; Scheme 1). Both MOFs perform a quantitative conversion of styrene within 4–5 h. Moreover, [Ca2Na2(CA)2(H2O)6]n·nH2O and [Sr3(CA)2(H2O)9]n·2nH2O were able to hydrogenate trans-stilbene, bulker than styrene, with a low conversion yield indicating that the hydrogenation of styrene took place inside the pores (i.e., the shape and size of pores were selective platforms preventing bulky alkene, trans-stilbene, from the complete hydrogenation).

For exploiting the strong Lewis acidity of s-block MOFs, we discuss the synthesis of a 4H-pyran derivative. Indeed, 4H-pyran derivatives possess a wide variety of biological applications. Many conventional catalysts were implemented for the synthesis of pyran derivatives. Using such catalysts, however, comes along with disadvantages of tedious synthesis including high reaction temperatures, complicated workup, and low yield. Jannalagadda et al. synthesized a Mg-MOF catalyst, formulated as [Mg3(NDC)3(DMF)4]·H2O (NDC = 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid),139 for promoting 4H-pyran derivatives under mild conditions.
[Mg3(NDC)3(DMF)4]·H2O is a 3D structure containing three crystallographically independent Mg2+ ions, surrounded by NDC linkers and DMF molecules. In the trimeric form of Mg clusters, Mg1 coordinates to six different carboxylate groups of NDC, while Mg2 links to three carboxylates from three different NDC linkers and two DMF molecules. The trinuclear SBU was established by oxygen atoms that bridge to both Mg1 and Mg2 through two different chelating modes (μ2–η1:η1 and μ2–η2:η1; Fig. 16).
 Fig. 16  Representation of the trimeric SBU of [Mg3(NDC)3(DMF)4]·H2O adopting Mg OMS. Atom colors: Mg, aqua; C gray; O, red. H atoms are omitted for clarity. 
[Mg3(NDC)3(DMF)4]·H2O was active for 4H-pyran heterocycle synthesis using cyanoacetamide, malonitrile, and 2,5-dimethoxy benzaldehyde as starting materials. The reaction was performed under different polar and non-polar solvents. Moreover, various aldehyde derivatives having electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups were investigated for their reactivity under the [Mg3(NDC)3(DMF)4]·H2O catalyst. The catalytic results revealed that the reaction did not proceed under non-polar organic solvents (toluene and n-hexane). The reaction, however, occurred efficiently in polar solvents and the activity was not affected by the substitute aldehydes. [Mg3(NDC)3(DMF)4]·H2O with large void space and Lewis acidic sites catalyzed the reaction with high selectivity and high yield. Particularly, the Mg OMS facilitate the condensation reaction between aldehyde and malononitrile to yield an aryldinemalonitrile intermediate that in turn reacts with cyanoacetamide to form the corresponding 4H-pyran compound (Scheme 2).

It should be noted that s-block MOFs often present the structure with infinite SBUs. In such structures, the density of metal sites per unit cell is very high, thus benefitting the catalytic activity of s-block MOFs. This behavior can be found in Mg-MOF-74 having strong Lewis acidic sites, active for several organic transformations. Indeed, the catalytic activity of Mg-MOF-74 consisting of 2,5-DHTA (2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid) and Mg-based rod clusters140 was investigated for converting sugars into methyl lactate (Scheme 3) and compared to that of M-MOF-74 (M = Co, Ni, and Zn). For methyl lactate production, Mg-MOF-74 showed the highest catalytic performance (highest yield and selectivity) attributed to its large surface area and strong Lewis acidic centers141 compared to Co, Ni, and Zn centers.

The OMS in MOFs have been recognized for enhancing the interaction between the MOF framework and adsorbates. As described by Hou et al.120 OMS in {[Ba2(BDPO)(H2O)]·DMA}n not only serve as binding sites for CO2 but also act as Lewis acid sites for CO2 fixation. Particularly, the CO2 fixation with propylene oxide was conducted in the presence of the TBAB (tetrabutylammonium bromide) cocatalyst under ambient conditions. High turnover frequency (TOF) was obtained (196.2) along with a high conversion (98.1%) after 48 h. This high catalytic activity was attributed to tabular shape channels that are suitable for the diffusion of both reactants and products. Other epoxides with different sizes and functionalities (–CH3Cl, –CH3Br, –C2H5, –Ph and –OPh) were also fixated with CO2 under identical conditions (Fig. 17). The different epoxide substrates reacted with CO2 to form the corresponding products with high yield. Styrene oxide and glycidyl phenyl ether, however, exhibited a low conversion of 19.8% and 52.3%, respectively. Despite its larger size, glycidyl phenyl showed higher conversion than styrene oxide because glycidyl phenyl has high polarity strongly interacting with the polar pore surfaces of the catalyst. And the low percent conversion of styrene oxide was ascribed to the low activity of β-carbons. The proposed mechanism suggested that the reaction started when oxygen atoms of epoxides bound to the exposed Lewis acidic sites, Ba2+ ions (this process occurred at the same time with CO2 adsorption on the framework of the catalyst). The Br− anion of TBAB then attacked the epoxide, opened the ring, and allowed cycloaddition of CO2 to the corresponding cyclic carbonate.

One of the classic organic reactions required both active acidic and basic centers is Knoevenagel condensation. To apply the Lewis catalytic sites of s-block MOFs, Abbasi et al.100 synthesized a series of MOFs based on BDC-OH linkers (BDC-OH = 2-hydroxyterephthalate), Mg2(BDC-OH)2(DMF)3, Ca(BDC-OH)(DMF)2, and Sr(BDC-OH)(DMF), termed Mg-HBDC, Ca-HBDC, and Sr-HBDC, respectively. Each MOF exhibits a different crystal structure (Fig. 18). Mg-HBDC presents a 3D structure with gra structure type (topology); Ca-HBDC is the first example of the Ca-MOF-based BDC-OH ligand adopting the pts topology; Sr-HBDC exhibits a 3D framework containing triangular 1D pore channels. The Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde and ethyl cyanoacetate was used as a model reaction to examine the catalytic activity of the three MOFs. Mg-HBDC, Ca-HBDC, and Sr-HBDC catalyze the Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde and ethyl cyanoacetate under mild conditions, outperforming previously reported MOFs that required higher temperatures for this reaction. Given that the Knoevenagel condensation requires acidic and basic catalytic sites. M-HBDC (M = Mg, Ca, and Sr) possesses Lewis acidic active sites which interact and polarize the aldehyde carbonyl groups. The –OH functionality on HBDC-OH corresponds to a basic site activating –CH2– of ethyl cyanoacetate (Scheme 4).

5.4. Separation
Selectively separating CO2 from the flue gas stream is one of the most important applications of MOFs in CO2 capture and sequestration. MOFs used for this application require high stability under humid conditions. Therefore, MOFs based on linkers with heteroatoms are mostly considered. It is rare, with a few exceptions of Mg-based MOFs, to use s-block MOFs for CO2 capture and separation. In this context, Yaghi et al.142 reported two Na-based MOFs, formulated as Na4(BDA)(CH3OH)(H2O) (MOF-705; BDA = (2S,2′S)-2,2′-(terephthaloylbis(azanediyl))disuccinic acid) and Na4(BPDA)(H2O)2 (MOF-706; BPDA = (2S,2′S)-2,2′-(([1,1′-biphenyl]-4,4′-dicarbonyl)bis(azanediyl))disuccinic acid) (Fig. 19). The infinite Na-oxo clusters connect to the flexible aspartate linkers to form edge- and corner-sharing polyhedra mainly contributing to the highly stability of MOF-705 and MOF-706. With the small pore and high thermal stability, both MOF-705 and MOF-706 can selectively separate CO2 from the flue gas stream (a CO2/N2 mixture). Indeed, the two MOFs efficiently separate 98% CO2 from the mixture flow of 16% CO2 and 84% N2 (v/v). In particular, MOF-705 exhibits a higher adsorption rate compared to MOF-706 (Table 6).

Nowadays, nuclear energy is an alternative to fossil fuels and provides a massive density of energy with small carbon emission. Nevertheless, its radioactive waste needs to be handled and separated safely. The separation of Xe/Kr is among the important treating processes. Apart from their harmful effects on the atmosphere, high grade Xe or Kr is valuable for applications in medical imaging, laser, and commercial lighting.143 Xe and Kr atoms have no dipole or quadrupole moment; therefore, separating them from other gases is challenging.
Another two gases having similar physical properties are ethylene and acetylene. Ethylene is widely used in the petrochemical industry for polyethylene manufacturing. Petroleum refining produces ethylene as a byproduct along with a small fraction of acetylene (1%).144 Although the availability of acetylene in a mixture of ethylene and acetylene is at the ppm level, it poisons catalysts and even causes explosion if the pressure exceeds 0.2 MPa. Therefore, the process of separating ethylene from the ethylene/acetylene mixture is comparably challenging similar to that of Xr/Kr separation. Consequently, discovering new materials for selectively separating these compounds is intriguing. In this context, Luo et al.145 reported the synthesis of [Sr4(TCPE)2(DMF)4(H2O)4]n·solvent using the TCPE (TCPE = tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)ethylene) linker with a quadrangular pore structure suitable for gas separation. The activated Sr-MOF possesses two types of quadrangular pores 3.6 Å (type-1) and 4.4 Å (type-2) which perfectly matches with the kinetic diameters of Xe (4.1 Å) and C2H4 (4.2 Å). The Sr-MOF shows notable performance for Xe capturing. Particularly, the single-component Xe adsorption measurement presents a type-I isotherm with a steep uptake at low pressure, proving the strong interaction between the Sr-MOF and Xe molecules. At the same time, the Kr isotherm of Sr-MOF implies a weaker interaction between the framework and Kr molecules. As for C2H2/C2H4, the adsorption isotherms show that Sr-MOF interacts with C2H2 stronger than with C2H4 and totally adsorbs C2H2 with an uptake of 38.6 cm3 cm−3, higher than that of C2H4 (26.7 cm3 cm−3).
The careful selection of organic building units along with suitable metal nodes can generate MOFs with appropriate pore structures beneficial to size-selective separation, an interesting property of MOFs for gas separation applications. As reported by Bao et al.146 the Ca-Sq (Sq = squarate ion) MOF constructed from squaric acid and Ca-based SBUs features a 1D pore channel of 3.4 Å × 3.4 Å. This channel diameter is similar to that of acetylene (3.3 Å) and smaller than those of ethylene and ethane (4.16 Å and 4.44 Å, respectively). This interesting structural feature made Ca-Sq capable of separating C2 from gas mixtures. Especially, C2H2 is separated from a C2H2/C2H4 mixture (50/50 v/v) with a selective constant of 8.1, much higher than that of C2H4 (5.9) from a C2H4/C2H6 mixture (50/50 v/v). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the framework affinity toward C2H2 is stronger than C2H4—this is due to the π–π interaction between C2H2 and squarate moieties.
The highlighted separation and storage applications of s-block MOFs are summarized in Table 6.
5.5. Sensing
MOFs have recently been explored for their potential as chemical sensors; the tunability of MOF structures and properties provides a certain advantage in the field of chemo-sensory materials. Sensing capabilities of several s-block MOFs have been examined and summarized.
Recently, luminescent frameworks have been considered as a direct consequence of several key factors, one of which is the production of a signal that is observable by the naked eye. Several MOFs have been included in this summary. The two MOFs, [Ca(HBTC)(H2O)]·2H2O and Rb(HBDC), which were previously mentioned in Section 5.1 were studied for their photoluminescence (PL) properties.99 In Rb(HBDC), each Rb cation connects to six carboxylate linkers. The resulting RbO6 polyhedra share edges to form 1D chains. These infinite chains are connected in a parallel manner via the carboxylate groups of the organic linkers. Each carboxylate linker is shared between two different Rb+ ions from two parallel chains. The photoluminescence properties of the two MOFs were studied at room temperature. Rb(HBDC) exhibited blue photoluminescence at 427 nm upon irradiation at 317 nm. Similar behavior was observed in the free H2BDC linker. This behavior is a result of the ligand-centered π*–n transition. Photoluminescence studies revealed a hypochromic blue shift for the [Ca(HBTC)(H2O)]·2H2O as compared to the free ligand H3BTC. The shift was attributed to the change of non-bonding orbital energy for oxygen atoms because of coordinated Ca2+ and hydrogen bonding to the carboxylate groups of the linker.
Motivated by the photoluminescence of MOFs based on H3BTC, Lu et al.147 reported [Sr(HBTC)(H2O)]n showing promising results in photoluminescence. The MOF has one crystallographic independent octa-coordinate Sr ion crystallizing in a distorted square antiprism structure. The Sr ion is penta-coordinated to five HBTC units binding through seven connected carboxylate oxygen atoms in different chelating and bridging modes, resulting in the formation of a 2D layered structure. The 2D layers are extended and linked through remaining carboxylate to form a 3D framework. A photoluminescence study was conducted using a pulse laser at different excitation powers, and two main peaks were observed; a strong peak was detected at 330 nm and it was considered as a ligand-based emission, and a weaker peak was detected at 640 nm which referred to ligand–metal charge transfer, representing a direct optical band gap energy of 1.94 eV. This experimental band gap was in good agreement with the theoretical value (2.04 eV) obtained by DFT calculations.
MOF frameworks with high conjugation provide attractive photoluminescence features for sensing applications. In order to obtain such structures, Sun et al.148 designed and successfully synthesized Ba5(ADDA)5(EtOH)2(H2O)3·5DMF (H2ADDA = 3,3′-(anthracene-9,10-diyl)diacrylic acid), termed UPC-17. The structure of UPC-17 exhibits an asymmetric unit with five Ba2+ ions, five ADDA linkers, two ethanol, and three coordinated water molecules. The five independent Ba2+ ions have coordination numbers from 7 to 10. Each Ba2+ connects to five organic linkers through different coordination modes, three of which are trans isomers while the remaining two are cis isomers. Ba2+ ions links to the carboxylate of ADDA ligands to form 1D rod-shaped SBUs. The 1D SBUs are then bridged by the backbone of ADDA ligands forming the porous 3D framework.
PL measurements of Ba5(ADDA)5(EtOH)2(H2O)3·5DMF at room temperature showed an emission at 546 nm when being excited at 330 nm. This transition can be attributed to the transition of π*–n or π*–π. PL measurements were also varied to detect metal ions in different organic solvents including methanol, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and acetone. In methanol, UPC-17 showed a 48 nm-peak shift as compared to the solid-state PL measurements. By conducting fluorescence titration, the gradual increase of Fe3+ concertation quenched 90% of the initial PL emission (turn-off) indicating high sensitivity toward Fe3+. Nevertheless, only 23% quenching was observed when using acetone indicating lower selectivity. Moreover, a 4.5-fold enhancement for Fe3+ detection in THF was observed. An increase in the PL emission intensity of the fluorescence enhancement (turn-on) was also observed upon the gradual addition of Fe3+. The sensing performance of the MOF was also tested for the detection of Al3+. An increase in the emission intensity was detected upon the gradual addition of Al3+ in THF, however, no effect was observed when using acetone or methanol. Furthermore, a sensing study of different nitroaromatic compounds resulted in varied quenching results. Remarkably, the MOF showed the highest sensitivity for 4-nitrophenol in acetone, THF, and methanol with 80%, 75%, and 60% quenching fluorescence percentage, respectively.
Mandal and co-workers reported the reaction of the H3BTB linker (1,3,5-benzenetribenzoic acid) with three alkaline earth metal ions (Ca, Sr, and Ba),108 which leads to the 3D formation of [H2N(CH3)2][Ca7(BTB)5-(H2O)8(DMF)4]·4H2O, [H2N(CH3)2][Sr5(H2O)(BTB)4], and [H2N(CH3)2][Ba(H2O) (BTB)], respectively. Especially, [H2(CH3)2][Ca7(BTB)5-(H2O)8(DMF)4]·4H2O comprises 1D zigzag chains of Ca–O–Ca arrays; [H2N(CH3)2][Sr5(H2O)(BTB)4] consists of Sr5O28 pentameric clusters; and [H2N(CH3)2][Ba(H2O)(BTB)] comprises 1D Ba–O–Ba arrays.
The band gap energies of [H2(CH3)2][Ca7(BTB)5-(H2O)8(DMF)4]·4H2O, [H2N(CH3)2][Sr5(H2O) (BTB)4], and [H2N(CH3)2][Ba(H2O) (BTB)] were found to be 2.65 eV, 3.22 eV, and 3.32 eV, respectively. The variation of optical band gaps in the three MOFs is due to the change of the coordinative environment around the metal ions. For example, Ca2+ ions adopt six to nine coordination, Sr2+ ions adopt six and eight coordination, and Ba2+ ions only crystallize in nine coordination geometry. With a larger optical band gap, [H2N(CH3)2][Ba(H2O) (BTB)] was investigated for piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties. Indeed, [H2N(CH3)2][Ba(H2O) (BTB)] crystallized in a non-centrosymmetric space group Pna21, which is responsible for its piezoelectric behavior originating from the motion of dimethylammonium cations located in the pores which resulted in a switching phase under the applied electric field. The second harmonic generation of [H2N(CH3)2][Ba(H2O)(BTB)] was also studied. [H2N(CH3)2][Ba(H2O) (BTB)] was the first stable MOF based on alkaline earth metal that was active as a nonlinear optical material.
The sensing capability of MOFs toward volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a prominent focus in the field of chemo-sensory materials. The hydrophobic characteristics paired with the moderate surface area of the Ca-SBF MOF made it promising for the selective response toward different VOCs.116 In a mixture of toluene, ethanol, acetone, and benzene, the signal of toluene vapor in a Ca-SBF modified quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor was the most sensitive in the concentration range of 0–60 ppm. Sensing saturation was reached at 100 ppm with a response recovery less than 1 min after flushing with N2. The high selectivity of Ca-SBF for toluene vapor was attributed to its nanoporous structure which led to weak interaction between toluene molecules and the MOF framework. The effect of pore size on the sensing capability of the Ca-SBF modified QCM transducers was studied using different substituted benzene compounds. It was suggested that increasing the number of alkyl groups on the benzene ring (e.g., mesitylene) will increase the σ–π and π–π interactions between the substituted alkyl groups and aromatic wall of the MOF framework as indicated by the slower frequency response of the QCM sensor modified with Ca-SBF.
Seco et al.149 synthesized a 3D MOF formulated as [K8(PTCA)3(H3O)4]n consisting of H4PTCA linkers (H4PTCA = perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylate) and dinuclear K-based clusters. K+ ions in this structure have two different coordination geometries: one K+ cation connects to eight oxygen atoms from five carboxylate groups and the other links to six oxygen atoms forming a distorted octahedral geometry. The π–π conjugation in this MOF makes it promising in fluorescent applications. Accordingly, a luminescence study on [K8(PTCA)3(H3O)4]n and H4PTCA was conducted in water at different concentrations of [K8(PTCA)3(H3O)4]n (15 μM to 3.75 mM). Two intense bands around 482 and 512 nm were observed which may result from π*→π electronic relaxations in the PTCA4− ligand and the electronic transitions involving the metal clusters, respectively. The strongest emissions were observed for the most diluted sample (15 μM) which makes [K8(PTCA)3(H3O)4]n a highly efficient fluorophore both in solution and the solid state. Signal loss was observed upon increasing the concentration of [K8(PTCA)3(H3O)4]n resulting from dynamic and/or static mechanisms.150 Interestingly, [K8(PTCA)3(H3O)4]n shows a capacitive response below 40% RH; at higher RH, its impedance turns conductive with a very sharp response. The advantage of using this 3D K-MOF relies on its behavior that changes from capacitive to resistive in less than 5% RH.
Guo et al.151 developed a Ba-MOF, [Ba(o-CbPhH2IDC)(H2O)4]n, using the H4PhIDC linker (H4PhIDC = 2-(2-carboxylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid) for ammonia gas sensing. The SBU of [Ba(o-CbPhH2IDC)(H2O)4]n consists of two adjacent Ba2+ atoms interconnected via two aqua bridging molecules and two μ2 imidazole carboxylate groups. The dimeric units are further connected via two o-CbPhH2IDC linkers, creating the infinite 1D chain. The chains are tethered through intermolecular hydrogen bonds to switch the 2D architecture into the 3D framework. This MOF exhibited high proton conductivity under relatively high humidity conditions which made it suitable for potential sensing applications. Indeed, subsequent experiments on ammonia sensing revealed that [Ba(o-CbPhH2IDC)(H2O)4]n could detect ammonia with a trace-level concentration under mild temperatures and high RH. Interestingly, [Ba(o-CbPhH2IDC)(H2O)4]n selectively detects ammonia in the presence of ten interfering gases.
As mentioned above, MOFs based on a highly conjugated backbone potentially contribute to sensing applications. While UPC-17, a Ba-MOF based on H2ADDA, is good for Fe3+ and Al3+ detection, another Ba-MOF whose structure also comprises H2ADDA and Ba-based clusters, [Ba2(ADDA)2(H2ADDA)(H2O)2]n, is capable of nitro-compound sensing.152 The coordinative environment around the Ba2+ ion includes six carboxylate groups, binding to Ba2+ in the bridging mode and chelating fashion, and one coordinated water molecule. As a result, the Ba2+ atom crystallizes in a distorted tricapped trigonal prism. Two neighboring Ba2+ atoms connect to two carboxylate groups creating an edge-sharing binuclear unit. Such units are further connected through carboxylate groups creating the infinite chain (Fig. 20). Adjacent rod chains are linked via ADDA2− bridging and H2ADDA linkers, thus forming a 3D framework.

The fluorescence response of [Ba2(ADDA)2(H2 ADDA)(H2O)2]n toward nitroaromatic compounds was investigated using a PL study. Upon dispersing the MOF in DMF, an intense peak appeared at 557 nm when excited at 380 nm. A turn-off response was obtained when the MOF encountered nitroaromatic compounds (e.g., 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), 2,6-DNT, 4-nitrotoluene (4-NT), 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP), and 4-nitrophenylamine (4-NPA)). Nevertheless, the opposite response (turn-on) toward 4-nitrobenzoic acid (4-NBA) was observed. To understand the turn-on behavior, dynamic 1H-NMR spectra were measured. The 1H-NMR spectrum revealed that characteristic peaks for the H2ADDA linker were observed upon the addition of 4-NBA indicating the release of H2ADDA from the MOF framework in solution. Based on the fluorescence study, the linker has higher fluorescence intensity than that of the MOF. Therefore, the release of the linker is responsible for the observed turn-on response. This MOF is the first luminescent MOF that exhibits the turn-on property for 4-NBA sensing.
Tang et al.111 synthesized [Sr(2,5-pzdc)(H2O)4]·H2O whose structure is filled by water molecules pointing toward the center of 1D channels. This is the main reason that makes this MOF proton-conductive. Indeed, the proton conductivity was measured at different RH and temperatures. It was observed that as RH increased, more coordinated and lattice H2O molecules were adsorbed into the 1D channels by hydrogen bonding with the oxygen atoms of the carboxylate groups. This behavior suggests that there is an interplay between conductivity and amount of water available where H2O molecules act as proton carriers improving the conductivity up to 9.05 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 98% RH.
To understand the mechanism, impedance was measured at constant humidity and varied temperatures. The authors conclude that the Grotthuss mechanism is responsible for this phenomenon, where protons jump from proton donors to proton acceptors through hydrogen bonds. Sr2+ ions increased the acidity of the coordinated H2O molecules facilitating them to donate protons to neighboring hydrogen-bonded lattice H2O molecules, forming a coordinative network for the proton transfer. Regardless of this occurrence, the asymmetric hydrogen bonding along the 1D channels formed by the discrete arrangement of H2O molecules is likely the reason for the low proton conductivity; this was also observed in different proton-conductive MOFs.111
Imidazole has been used in the doping strategy to improve proton conductivity in MOFs. Bearing this in mind, Chen et al. used a linker that is based on an imidazolate entity, H3PhIDC linker (H3PhIDC = 2-phenyl-4,5-imidazole dicarboxylic acid), to synthesize a proton-conductive MOF, [Sr(μ2-H2PhIDC)2(H2O)4]·2H2O.153 The proton conductivity of [Sr(μ2-H2PhIDC)2(H2O)4]·2H2O was studied under various conditions (temperatures from 30–100 °C at 93–98% RH). There was a directly proportional relationship between conductivity and temperature. Particularly, the conductivity increased as temperature increased. The conductivity reached a maximum value at 90 °C followed by a slight decrease of conductivity at 100 °C. The authors claim that this decrease could be attributed to the desorption of water molecules at high RH (98%).153 The authors also examined the effect of the vapor environment on the proton conductivity of the MOF using ammonia vapor. In particular, six different ammonia concentrations (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 M) were tested at 30–100 °C. The conductivity increased when the temperature increased for all different concentrations of ammonia solution. For example, the conductivity of 3.0 M ammonia solution increased from 2.89 × 10−7 S cm−1 to 4.76 × 10−2 S cm−1 when increasing temperature from 30 °C to 100 °C. Additionally, at 100 °C, the proton conductivity of [Sr(μ2-H2PhIDC)2(H2O)4]·2H2O increased from 2.30 × 10−5 S cm−1 (in 0.01 M ammonia solution) to 4.76 × 10−2 S cm−1 (in 3.0 M ammonia solution). These results firmly demonstrate the correlation between temperature and conductivity.
Fluorescent MOFs have interesting applications as sensors because they possess a high surface area as well as intense and controllable fluorescence. In this regard, Kojima et al.154 prepared a fluorescent Ca-based MOF using the 1,4-NDC linker (1,4-NDC = 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid), {(H3O+)2[Ca(NDC)(C2H5O)(OH)]}4·1.1H2O, denoted by CaNDC-MOF. The excitation spectra of 1,4-NDC and CaNDC-MOF were studied. For the linker, the fluorescence peak was observed at 470 nm when excited at 385 nm, while CaNDC-MOF showed a violet fluorescence peak at 395 nm when excited at 350 nm. The authors discussed two possible pathways corresponding to the observed fluorescence in the MOF. First, the detected blue shift in the fluorescence peak of CaNDC-MOF is ascribed to the LMCT transition in the MOF where Ca2+ ions bonding to the linkers resulted in a 75-nm shift in the PL spectrum. The blue shift also confirms that the linker was incorporated into the framework of CaNDC-MOF lengthening distances between molecules. LMCT-based fluorescence MOFs reported so far have exhibited red-shifts, however, the CaNDC-MOF is the first MOF that shows a blue shift attributed to the LMCT transition. Second, the fluorescence originating from the linker and Ca2+ ion did not contribute to the fluorescence spectra. This suggestion was proposed after studying the fluorescence of 1,4-NDC solution in a mixture of water and ethanol which showed a fluorescence peak at 412 nm when excited at 369 nm. These similar results to those of the CaNDC-MOF are ascribed to the linker being dispersed in the crystalline structure of the MOF, which is similar to the solution resulting in similar fluorescence behavior.
Two isoreticular and photoluminescence Sr-MOFs, Sr(BPDCNO2)2(DMF)2(H2O)2, (H2BPDCNO2 = 2-nitro-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid) and Sr4(BP(NO2)2)4(DMF)2(H2O)4·2DMF, (H2BP(NO2)2 = 2,2′-dinitro-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid), termed WUF-15 and WUF-16, respectively, were reported by Richardson and co-workers.155 The SBU structure of WUF-15 crystallizes in a linear chain having two independent edge-sharing Sr2+ ions. On the other hand, the linear SBU chain of WUF-16 consists of four crystallographically independent Sr2+ ions arranged in pairs and an alternating fashion which further generate the 3D structure. WUF-15 and WUF-16 exhibited high porosity and large pore volume which reveals two types of void channels: triangular and square (Fig. 21a and b). Especially, the triangular channels share edges to form the separate square channels with a diameter of 18 Å, the largest reported pore size among Sr-MOFs.
 Fig. 21  Structural representations of WUF-15 (a), WUF-16 (b), and WUF-17 (c). Atom colors: Sr, aqua; C, gray; O, red; N, blue. H atoms are omitted for clarity. 
The authors have also successfully crystallized another Sr-MOF, Sr(BC)(H2O)2, (H2BC = benzo[c]cinnoline-3,8-dicarboxylic acid) termed WUF-17. Sr2+ ions in WUF-17 connect to four carboxylate groups, two aqua bridging ligands, and one water molecule. Each two adjacent Sr2+ ions are plane-sharing to the other two to finally form the infinite Sr-based clusters. The stacking of the BC linkers in the chain results in the 3D structure (Fig. 21c).
Sr2+ and the linear nitro-functionalized biphenyl dicarboxylate linkers in the three MOFs were chosen for their torsional angles and flexibility in the photoluminescence application. Emission spectra of WUF-15 and WUF-16 and their nitro-functionalized ligands were recorded. Both MOFs and their corresponding linkers were weakly fluorescent. WUF-17 and H2BC linkers, however, exhibited interesting photoluminescence properties. Particularly, H2BC displayed two peaks at 374 nm and 524 nm likely resulted from either the π*→π transition of the aromatic structure or from the ligand-to-ligand charge transfer. Along the similar peaks in the PL spectrum compared to H2BC, WUF-17 was very emissive and showed an extra shoulder at 486 nm due to the close π–π stacking between H2BC moieties in the MOF structure presenting a new pathway for emission.
Another strategy applied in designing sensing materials is doping metal ions into a MOF structure (PSM method). In this regard, emissive metals are used. For example, Eu ions were doped into [Ba(DPA)2(H2O)2]n termed Eu@BCP (DPA stands for dipicolinic acid) and Tb ions were incorporated into [Ba(DPA)2(H2O)2]n termed Tb@BCP.156 Both Eu@BCP and Tb@BCP showed strong emission upon UV irradiation: Tb@BCP exhibited an intense green emission and Eu@BCP featured a red emission. Moreover, the fluorescence spectra of Eu@BCP and Tb@BCP presented dual-emitting characteristics while the emission spectrum of Eu@BCP nanosheets displayed a broad band at 415 nm attributed to the host lattice with the emission signal that corresponds to the electronic transitions from excited Eu3+ ions to the lower states. On the other hand, the emission spectrum of Tb@BCP nanosheets displayed an emission band of the host-lattice peaks corresponding to the electronic transitions from excited Tb3+ ions to the lower states.
With the interesting emission properties, Eu@BCP and Tb@BCP were then evaluated as temperature sensors and for PDA detection. First, for temperature sensing, the fluorescence intensity of the host lattice was enhanced upon raising the temperature from 20 °C to 90 °C. The fluorescence intensity of bare BCP nanosheets at 415 nm decreased indicating the efficient energy transfer from BCP to Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions. The trend of decreasing fluorescence intensity when increasing temperature indicates that the energy transfer from BCP to Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions is temperature dependent. Second, for DPA sensing, the emission intensity of Eu@BCP and Tb@BCP nanosheets was recorded in different concentrations of DPA (0–35 μM). When the concentration of DPA increases, the fluorescence intensity will increase. The detection limits were 0.038 M DPA for Eu@BCP and 0.033 nM DPA for Tb@BCP.
The last example is a Mg-based MOF adopting a frustrated backbone (i.e., unreacted functionalities). Especially, Zhang and co-workers157 reported the synthesis and characterization of a novel 3D Mg-based luminescent MOF formulated as [Mg2(APDA)2(H2O)3]·5DMA·5H2O (Mg-APDA; H2APDA = 4,4′-(4-aminopyridine-3,5-diyl)dibenzoic acid). Mg-APDA possesses 1D hexagonal microporous channels which bear amine functionalities (i.e., the Lewis basic sites) and dangling carboxylate moieties. Owing to such unique structural features, Mg-APDA (Fig. 22) was active in detecting Fe3+ ions, pesticides, and antibiotics.
 Fig. 22  Structural representation of Mg-APDA. Atom colors: Mg, aqua; C, gray; O, red; N, blue. H atoms are omitted for clarity. 
In terms of structure, Mg-APDA consists of two crystallographically independent Mg2+ ions. Mg1 crystallizes in a distorted octahedral geometry; Mg1 binds to three oxygen atoms from three different carboxylate groups, one nitrogen atom from the pyridine ring, and two water molecules. Mg2 crystallizes in a regular six-coordinated octahedral geometry which is formed from three oxygen atoms from three different carboxylate functionalities, one nitrogen from pyridine occupying the equatorial position, and two water molecules occupying the axial positions. The dinuclear SBU, Mg2(–COO)2(μ-H2O), of Mg-APDA was formed by linking Mg1 and Mg2 via two bridging carboxylate groups and one water molecule in a μ–H2O binding mode. The 3D framework is formed by interconnecting each SBU to its 12 neighboring SBUs which forms 1D hexagonal channels.
In the photoluminescence study, the authors used different metal ions, of which Fe3+ exhibits almost complete quenching effect on the luminescence of Mg-APDA, whereas other metal ions show insignificant quenching effects on the fluorescence emission of Mg-APDA. This result indicates a high selectivity for detection of Fe3+ ions. Remarkably, it was found that the detection limit of Mg-APDA for Fe3+ ions is comparable to that of other reported fluorescent MOFs. Owing to the positive sensing capability of Mg-APDA toward Fe3+ ions, further sensing exploration for different antibiotics was attempted. Particularly, Mg-APDA can detect nitrofurans (NF) such as nitrofurazone (NZF) and nitrofurantoin (NFT). NZF and NFT were detected by the Mg-APDA sensing material with a detection limit of 108 ppb and 126 ppb, respectively. Quenching efficiencies of NZF were 97.2% and NFT 97.6%. Mg-APDA showed negligible or insignificant effects on the luminescent intensity for other antibiotics.
The effect of five different pesticides on the fluorescence emission of Mg-APDA was also studied. The fluorescence emission is quenched by 2,6-dichloro-4-nitroaniline (DCN), while the other pesticides have no apparent effects on the luminescence intensity. Competition experiments showed that the co-existence of other pesticides has no effect on the luminescence quenching response induced by DCN. In conclusion, Mg-APDA can be used as a promising fluorescent probe for selective detection of Fe3+, NF class of antibiotics, and DCN.

5.6. Other applications

5.6.1. Antibacterial materials. 
Microbial resistance from pathogenic bacteria is growing at an alarming rate and conventional antibiotics are getting ineffective due to the mutating nature of the resistant bacteria. Nair et al.158 prepared a Sr-MOF layer based on L-dimalatepentahydrate termed DSM with a chemical formula of Sr2(C4H4O5)2·5H2O. The anti-bacterial properties of DSM were tested against different bacterial strains including Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 902, Staphylococcus epidermis MTCC 435(SE), Bacillus subtilis MTCC 2756(BS), Escherichia coli MTCC 2622(EC), Klebsiella pneumoniae MTCC 109(KP), and Proteus mirabilis MTCC 425(PM); of which Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 902, Staphylococcus epidermis MTCC 435(SE), and Bacillus subtilis MTCC 2756(BS) are Gram positive, whereas Escherichia coli MTCC 2622(EC), Klebsiella pneumoniae MTCC 109(KP), and Proteus mirabilis MTCC 425(PM) are Gram negative.
The antimicrobial activities (measured as the diameter of the zone of inhibition formed for discs in mm) of DSM were determined by the disc diffusion method against the aforementioned bacteria. Moreover, the activities were compared with the those of standard piperazine. The diameter of the zone of inhibition formed for discs was found to be active except for the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. Compared to the activity of piperazine, Gram positive Staphylococcus aureus was found to be more active while the others show lower activity.


5.6.2. Electrochemistry. 
A K-MOF formulated as [C7H3KNO4]n was synthesized from pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (H2PDA) and employed as an anode in organic potassium-ion batteries (OPIBs) with a long life cycle.159 [C7H3KNO4]n shows a unique and reversible three-step redox reaction and displays a superior electrochemical performance thanks to the assistance of abundant N–K/O–K coordination bonds. Indeed, [C7H3KNO4]n exhibits an average specific capacity of 115 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 for 300 cycles with a capacity retention of 92%.
Xu et al. reported a Ca-MOF as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries.160 The MOF delivers a reversible capacity of higher than 140 mA h g−1 and durably works for at least 300 cycles. This remarkable performance is attributed to the high structural stability in electrolytes. This study showcases the ability of Ca-MOFs suffering adverse electrolytic conditions—which is rare and impressive—thus, encouraging more research in this field using s-block MOFs in general.
In another study reported by Li et al.,105 the effect of water molecules in both anhydrous and hydrated form of a Ca-terephthalate MOF (CaTPA and CaTPA·3H2O, respectively) was investigated. The anode activity of CaTPA·3H2O (CaC8H4O4·3H2O) for lithium-ion batteries was compared to that of its anhydrous counterpart, CaTPA (CaC8H4O4). The transformation of this MOF from the hydrated form to anhydrous form involves breaking the bonds between metal ions and oxygen atoms of the carboxylate moieties. This process is associated with the change of metal coordination number. In particular, the Ca2+ ion in CaTPA·3H2O is an 8-coordinate unit, a dodecahedral geometry, consisting of 4 coordinated water molecules and 4 oxygen atoms. In contrast, the Ca2+ ion in CaTPA coordinates to 6 oxygen atoms with a coordination number of 6. The cycling performance of CaTPA is affected by the presence of unstable water molecules in the structure. In general, water molecules change the coordinative environment around the metal ion which in turns reduces the order of Ca–Ca layers and increases the crowdedness of active oxygen atoms in the carboxylate functionalities. This behavior also negatively affects the cycling performance of CaTPA·3H2O. This work is a preliminary study on the interplay between structures and electrochemical properties and casts light on new perspectives in designing new electrode materials based on MOFs as well as expanding the scope of MOFs in various applications.

5.6.3. Pyrotechnic applications. 
Pyrotechnics has always been an essential component of festivities, and its history dated back thousands of years in the ancient civilization. In modern times, the function of pyrotechnics has been expanded to cover a wide range of applications from civilian to military. The reaction in these compounds is basically explosive, and as such they must contain components that are oxidative and easily combustible to enable redox reactions. To a greater extent, such reactions are useful, however, the combustion of chlorine-based pyrotechnics has side effects on human health. Therefore, development of chlorine-free pyrotechnics is widely sought. Among the novel green combustible, azole-based energetic MOFs (EMOF) hold promise. In principle, nitrogen-rich azole EMOFs have promising properties including their high enthalpy of formation that provides the primary energy source and the green combustion reaction that produces greener products. In fact, the generated products allow metal ions to distribute in a monoatomic fashion inside the flame which in turn produces an enhanced color performance. EMOFs based on s-block metals adopt highly oxidizing properties.139 In particular, a Cs-based MOF synthesized from N-(5′-amino-1H,1′H-[3,3′-bi(1,2,4-triazol)]-5-yl)nitramine (HABTNA) ligand, termed EMOF-1, was studied by Wang et al.161 EMOF-1 shows promising energetic and colorant properties that are essential in the development of pyrotechnics. EMOF-1, a highly thermal-stable structure, crystalizes in a 3D structure with abundance of N-based entities and balanced oxygen content. Therefore, it is safe to handle. The authors proved that EMOF-1 is non-hygroscopic, insensitive, and contains high combustible energy, offering a new alternative to replace toxic chlorine-based MOFs.
Most of the conventional compounds used in pyrotechnics are flammable and can cause self-oxidative combustion. They are sensitive to water causing wetting inconvenience along with other health related risks. EMOF-1 paves the way for developing novel research that would make explosive materials more safe and pyrotechnics appealing to the public.

6. Conclusion and future perspectives
This review summarizes the versatile structures and applications of s-block MOFs. Particularly, the properties, coordinative environments of the SBUs of s-block MOFs, linker designs, and the relationship between their structural features and applications in gas storage and separation, adsorption of small molecules, chemical/drug delivery, catalysis, sensing, and many more were discussed comprehensively. Our highlights in this article indicate the groundbreaking features of s-block MOFs which will attract more considerable attention from the research community for multiple applications.
In s-block MOF chemistry, structures rely on ionic bonds and the structural dimensionality depends much on the connectivity between organic linkers and metal ions (e.g., Li, Na). For heavier metal ions, the resulting extended structures tend to be more complex and advocate against interpenetration. Additionally, using s-block metals with a large ionic radius for MOF construction leads to low charge density frameworks, and they are prone to accommodate coordinated solvents; removing such guest molecules binding to metal clusters during activation often results in structural collapse. For MOFs based on alkaline earth metal ions, there is no solid evidence that presents the specific trend in the formation of MOFs. Indeed, like the alkali ions, as the atomic size increases, the coordination number of metals in MOFs based on group 2A increases; and 3D structures are expected to form, although such structures are serendipitously produced rather than systematically designed.
MOFs based on s-block metal ions have not been thoroughly investigated because of the following reasons:
(1) The unpredictable structures originating from the reactive metal sources often prevail.
(2) Balancing the high porosity and stability remains challenging.
(3) The ionic bonds between metal ions and linkers negatively affect the synthetic conditions.
(4) There is a lack of predesigned SBUs that can overcome the synthesis challenges to form multiple and complex structures.
In order to expand the scope of s-block MOFs, we herein present the future perspectives through several questions that should be addressed in sequence.
(1) How to overcome the structural instability of s-block MOFs?
The ability of light s-block metal ions to form a tetrahedral environment makes their frameworks vulnerable and unstable compared to that of d- or f-block metal ions. Moreover, due to the electronic nature and a lack of ligand field stabilization energy of s-block metal ions, s-block MOFs show most instability. In addition, the inability of s-block metal ions to form higher valence preventing them from forming a strong electrostatic interaction with heteroatoms of coordinating linkers results in less stable frameworks. It should be noted that the robustness of the frameworks depends on the geometry and connectivity of the linkers and SBUs. Toward obtaining structures with inherent porosity while maintaining the robustness of structural architectures, a higher coordination number of metals or higher connectivity of SBUs (i.e., high connectivity of points of extension) must be obtained. In order to fulfill this task, the organic linker may contain multiple functional groups instead of only carboxylic acid. Additionally, functionalities that enable μ3-based linkages with metal clusters (e.g., O and P) would be interesting to investigate the structural formation of s-block MOFs. Such linkages will enhance the rigidity of MOFs and further avoid coordination of guest molecules, thus improving the stability of s-block MOFs.
(2) How to synthesize more complex s-block MOF structures?
Not many linkers with different connectivity or linkers with multiple functionalities have been investigated for making s-block MOFs. We believe that functionalized linkers with specific properties can adopt a higher coordination environment, thus improving the complexity of s-block MOFs. For example, CD-based linkers react with various s-block metals (K, Ca, Na) to form sophisticated sugar-based structures. Modifying functionalized linkers with similar properties may expand the scope of s-block MOF structures with interesting applications. As we discussed in the structural features of organic linkers used for the synthesis of s-block MOFs, s-block metals binding to heteroatoms (e.g., N-based carboxylate or azolate linkers) will generate stable extended structures. The combination between multiple functionalities and heteroatom-based linkers would solve two problems, stability and multiplicity, of s-block MOFs. Finally, we review recent findings from Frenking and Zhou et al. who firmly state that Ca, Sr, and Ba may use their genuine valence orbitals of (n−1)d functions to coordinate to ligands that are based on CO or N2 functionality. As a result, Ca, Sr, and Ba can be 8-coordinate units which strongly enhance the robustness and diversity of the framework.162–164 These studies imply that there exist opportunities for us to reticulate specific multitopic linkers into extended structures based on s-block metal SBUs mimicking the donor–acceptor interactions of transition metals.
(3) How to expand the scope of s-block MOFs in practical applications?
Expanding the scope of s-block MOFs in practical applications lies at the heart of obtaining more functionalized and complex MOFs. In other words, this task depends much on the structural diversity of s-block MOFs which must be prioritized.
Finally, we think that the future trend for syntheses and uses of various s-block MOFs gathers all aforementioned properties of organic linkers and most importantly, multibinary systems with diverse functionalities should be mainly considered and applied in rational ways for the designed synthesis of s-block MOFs. Especially, functional groups beyond carboxylates are strongly required for obtaining a variety of stable and appealing MOFs based on s-block elements.
