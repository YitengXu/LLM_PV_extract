    , Accepted 15th July 2016First published on 27th July 2016AbstractA novel method has been developed to recharge and rejuvenate perovskite solar cells by immersing the device into methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) solution and heating at 70 °C for 40 s. We demonstrated that Au electrodes are more robust than Al and Ag electrodes for ZnO planar structures rather than ZnO and TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). In addition to this, the degradation mechanism of the device has been discussed. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy are evidence that the perovskite crystals have been regenerated after degradation (60 days) with the help of MAI as a rejuvenating agent. After long-term aging tests with rejuvenation in 185 days, its PCE value is still around 11% compared to the original one of 11.6%.
1. Introduction
Organic and inorganic solar cells are an icon of the quest for renewable energy. Devices that never need batteries and in some cases, don't even have an off button are a wonder in science. Efforts in harvesting the sun’s energy have been under way for decades. The notion or perception of the use of free electricity from the sun is a never ending promise. On a bright, glorious day, the sun’s rays produce ∼1000 Watts of energy per square meter of the earth's surface. If we could collect all of that energy, we could easily power our homes and offices for free. Solar cells: how exactly can they turn light into energy and store it?
There are several challenges in the literature to name a few: (1) power conversion efficiency,1–24 (2) auxiliary chemicals which can enhance the stability of active layers,25–28 (3) performance in different temperature, light and humidity conditions,29–37 (4) ecotoxicity and recyclability,28,38–40 and (5) stability of perovskite solar cells.41
Here we address a few of these to some extent, and try for the first time to recharge the perovskite solar cell device using MAI as a rejuvenating agent. Of general concern, several pioneers such as Miyasaka, Yang-Yang, Grätzel and Snaith et al., have been continually talking about the improvement of perovskite solar cells.1,3,11,42 However here we did so, yet there is still a lot to know about the commercialization process of solar panels from the lab to home benefits.
In a very recent report, Huang and coworkers used polythiophene as a hole transporting layer to enhance the stability and preserved the device under irradiation in a N2 glovebox at a temperature of 35 °C over 33 days.43 Karunadasa and coworkers used PEA (C6H5(CH2)2NH3+) to fabricate the perovskite layer and the device can be preserved for more than 46 days under 52% relative humidity.26 Ma and coworkers used carbon as an electrode and the device can be preserved for 83 days with 6% PCE in air in the dark.44 Compared to their research, our rejuvenation method is the first reported and it is simple to rejuvenate the device which can be prolonged for over 100 days with a PCE of 11%.
2. Experimental section
Device fabrication
ITO glass substrates (purchased from Wintek, Taiwan; sheet resistance 30 Ω sq−1) were cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in an ultrasonic bath and then dried overnight in an oven at >100 °C. Zinc acetate dihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 10 mg mL−1) and a small amount of ethanolamine (Sigma-Aldrich) was spin-coated on pre-cleaned ITO substrates and baked at 160 °C for 10 minutes in the air to form a planar ZnO layer.45 A TiO2 nanoparticle layer was spin-coated at 6000 rpm/80 s and baked at 160 °C for 10 minutes (10 mg mL−1 in ethanol). A ZnO nanoparticle layer was spin-coated at 3000 rpm/40 s three times (6 mg mL−1 in n-butanol, methanol and chloroform). The PbI2 solution (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) at a concentration of 460 mg mL−1 was spin-coated on top of the electron transporting layer at 3000 rpm for 15 s. After drying for 10 minutes in the glove box, the substrate was heated on a hot plate at 70 °C for 10 minutes. Then, the substrate was dipped into a solution of CH3NH3I (Front Materials Co. Ltd) in anhydrous IPA (10 mg mL−1) for 45 s and washed with IPA. Subsequently, the solution of Spiro-OMeTAD purchased from Front Materials Co. Ltd (80 mg Spiro-OMeTAD, 28.5 mL 4-tertbutylpyridine and 17.5 mL lithium-bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) all dissolved in 1 mL chlorobenzene) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the metal electrode (∼80 nm) was evaporated through a shadow mask under vacuum (<10−6 Torr). Each sample consists of four independent pixels defined by an active area of 0.04 cm2 and the preparation of ZnO and TiO2 nanoparticles was according to previous reports.46,47

ZnO nanoparticles. 
Zinc acetate dihydrate (2.95 g) was dissolved in methanol (125 mL) at 65 °C; a solution of KOH (1.48 g in methanol 65 mL) was added in 15 min to the zinc acetate dihydrate solution under stirring. After 2.5 h, the nanoparticles started to precipitate and the solution became turbid. The heater and stirrer were removed. The precipitate and the mother liquor were separated by centrifugation, and the precipitate was washed twice with methanol (20 mL). After the washing steps, the precipitate was dried in ambient air.


TiO2 nanoparticles. 
One milliliter of TiCl4 was introduced to a glass vial containing 5 mL of anhydrous ethanol. 20 mL of anhydrous benzyl alcohol was added, and the container was left open with the whole mixture at 80 °C and continuously stirred for about 11 h. The white precipitate was then washed in ethanol and centrifuged again. The final suspension was dried in ambient air.

Device characterization
The devices were characterized in air under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 simulated light (Yamashita Denso solar simulator). Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs were obtained by a Keithley 2400 SMU. Solar illumination conforming to the JIS Class AAA was provided by a SAN-EI 300W solar simulator equipped with an AM 1.5G filter. The light intensity was calibrated with a Hamamatsu S1336-5BK silicon photodiode.
Rejuvenation method
After two months, the devices were immersed in a 20 mL vial filled with MAI (10 mg mL−1 IPA) and heated at 70 °C for 40 seconds. Later on, the devices were rinsed with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 10 seconds and dried with a gas flow.
3. Results and discussion
Selection of working electrode
Some literature is concerned with the effect of various metal electrodes with different work functions. At first, Chen and coworkers pointed out that Ag/Al is a stable electrode that can be used for more than 14 days with 50% efficiency compared to the original.48 Later on, Yang and coworkers proposed that the Cr2O3/Cr electrode improves the stability without the S-shape in the J–V curve.49 However, this electrode reduced the performance at the same time. Afterwards, Ko and coworkers used Mo as a robust electrode which has superior resistance and restoration capability against external scratches or deformation.50 Here, we also investigate three commonly employed metals – aluminum (Al), silver (Ag), and gold (Au) – as working electrodes to analyze the effect of different work functions in ambient air.
These device structures are ITO/P-ZnO/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/metals (Al, Ag, and Au). Photographs of these devices are shown in Fig. 1. A rapid oxidation of aluminium to aluminum oxide is observed when using the aluminium electrode in ambient air, as shown in a comparison of Fig. 1a and d. This indicates that the low work function of aluminium allows it to be easily oxidized, suggesting that it is not a suitable electrode. The silver electrode turns grey, which indicates the formation of silver oxide as shown in Fig. 1e. Compared to the aluminium and silver electrodes, the gold electrode retains its metallic lustre because of its high work function, as shown in a comparison of Fig. 1c and f. After 18 days, the degradation of perovskite is obviously visible, as shown in Fig. 1d–f. The results show that the underlying perovskite absorbing layer is well protected by the gold and the selection of the metal electrode is extremely important for the stability of PSCs.

(a), (b), and (c) show the original devices with aluminum, silver, and gold electrodes, respectively, in ambient conditions with a relative humidity of 80%. (d), (e), and (f) show the devices in (a), (b), and (c), respectively, after 18 days in ambient conditions with a relative humidity of 80%. All the electrodes have been coated on planar ZnO structures. 
Selection of electron transporting layer
Having demonstrated the necessity of using gold as a working electrode, we further investigate the various metal oxide-coated substrates of perovskite to test the extent of degradation in ambient air with a relative humidity of 80%. In a very recent report, Snaith and coworkers doped Al into TiO2 in a high temperature sintering step as an electron transporting layer.51 Gong and coworkers modified the ITO surface with Cs2CO3 as an electron transporting layer and preserved the devices for more than 13 days under 20% relative humidity.52 According to this literature, they envisioned that choosing a suitable ETL for perovskite solar cells is important. Recently, low temperature syntheses of ZnO and TiO2 have attracted significant attention due to their potential use in roll-to-roll processing. As a result, we prepared devices with three different metal oxide-coated substrates, as shown in Fig. 2. Specifically, the three devices are TiO2 NP, ZnO NP, and planar ZnO-based structures. Fig. 2a–c show the metallic luster of gold in the three devices’ original states. After 18 days, the areas not covered by gold have turned yellow, indicating the formation of PbI2. The obvious yellow region in the active layer indicates a weak resistance to moisture in the TiO2 and ZnO NPs-based structures (Fig. 2d and e). Showing the advantages of the ZnO compact, planar layer, the device exhibits an unscratched active layer with a dark brown color (Fig. 2f). Moreover, it demonstrates the excellent stability of the planar ZnO structures that outperform the NP-types of TiO2 and ZnO.

(d), (e), and (f) show the devices in (a), (b), and (c), respectively, after 18 days in ambient conditions with a relative humidity of 80%. Au was used as a working electrode. 
The effect of moisture erosion on vertical and horizontal directions
Both the metal electrode and the electron transporting layer (ETL) affect the device stability. However, they do not explain why the moisture invades vertically more rapidly than horizontally in the experiments above. We attribute this phenomenon to the surface area effect as shown in Fig. 3a, where the top side surface area is larger than the edge side surface area. A larger surface area means more contact with oxygen and moisture. Thus, the vertical invasion of moisture through the top surface, shown with a big yellow arrow, (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm), is greater than the horizontal invasion through the edge side, shown with the smaller arrow (4 × 1.5 cm × 500 nm). Furthermore, the top surface can be divided into major and minor parts when we discuss the erosion in the active layers as shown in Fig. 3b. Here, we define the major invading parts as the areas without protection by the gold electrode. The major parts are prone to degradation of perovskite, indicating the importance of the metal electrode. In the minor parts where the top surface is covered by the gold electrode, moisture invasion is minimized, and only occurs in the horizontal direction. This result is consistent with a recent study by Kamat and coworkers.37 They indicate that the moisture slowly permeates through the perovskite film due to the formation and the strength of CH3NH3+-hydrogen-bonds on the surface.
 Fig. 3  (a) Top view of the device in 2D: thick and thin yellow arrows show major and minor invasion. (b) Cross-sectional 3D view of the device under the electrode: big and small blue arrows represent that the moisture invasion in the vertical direction is greater than in the horizontal direction. 
Rejuvenation and device lifetime
The degradation process can be divided into two parts in the device lifetime as shown in Fig. 4. Here, we defined status I as a pristine condition. In that state, the device is prepared and preserved in ambient air with a relative humidity of 50%. After long term aging in ambient air, the device is in status II. The perovskite is pristine only in the areas with gold metal protection and it shows the color of PbI2 in the other areas. We attribute this degradation process to the surface area effect as we mentioned before. As a result, the degradation is more severe in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction. By taking advantage of the gold electrode, the active layer can be well protected in the vertical direction. Moreover, to address the issue of horizontal degradation, we propose a simple approach that immerses the aging devices in a solution of CH3NH3I as shown in ESI,† S1. This efficient method rejuvenates the aging device from status II to status I, thereby prolonging the device lifetime.

Device performance
The J–V characteristics of the device are shown in Fig. 5 and summarized in Table 1. The original device has a PCE of 11.59% with a Voc of 0.98 V, a Jsc of 18.77 mA cm−2, and a FF of 63%. These numbers indicate a moderate PCE compared to the current performance of OMPSCs.53 Moreover, when we immerse the device which has been kept in ambient air for two months in CH3NH3I solution, the device delivers a stable PCE of 11.59% with a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 18.53 mA cm−2, and a FF of 69%. The consistent performance is attributed to this rejuvenating method. After 80 days and 120 days of aging the rejuvenated device shows a PCE of 11.44%, and 11.31%, respectively; their Voc is 0.95 V and 0.92 V, their Jsc is 18.24 mA cm−2 and 17.28 mA cm−2, and their FF is 66% and 71%, respectively. Thereafter, we immerse the device in the CH3NH3I solution again up to 185 days. The device has an unchanged PCE of 11.04% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 17.22 mA cm−2, and a FF of 70%. Once again, we demonstrate that this method is useful and reproducible. In conclusion, the structure of the device protects it well vertically, while the rejuvenating method can protect it horizontally by minimizing its contact with water and oxygen. Thus, we successfully prolong the device lifetime by more than four months. As far as we know, this is the longest lifetime (4 months) of perovskite solar devices with a similar PCE of 11% in an ambient environment. The performances (PCEs) of other devices (ITO/ZnO – planar/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Al, Ag, Au and ITO/ZnO – planar and ZnO, TiO2 NPs/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au) have been tabulated in the ESI,† Tables S1 and S2.

SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and XRD (X-ray diffraction)
To further confirm the rejuvenating method for the perovskite absorbing layer, we use SEM to prove this strategy. Fig. 6 reveals the surface morphology of status I and II. Fig. 6a shows the morphology of pristine PbI2 with lots of voids. Fig. 6b presents an image of pristine perovskite with high surface coverage after dipping the PbI2 thin film into the solution of MAI at 45 seconds. After long-term aging, the image of degraded perovskite is shown in Fig. 6c. We found that the degradation process from perovskite to PbI2 was accomplished with a reduction in volume. This result coincided with a recent report by Seok and coworkers.14 It implied that the device was more permeable to moisture and oxygen when it degraded to PbI2. To alleviate this issue, the rejuvenation method was demonstrated. As shown in Fig. 6d, it exhibited a mixture of cubic crystals and voids. This evidence proves that the rejuvenating method does indeed work.

Additionally, we also use XRD to check the crystallographic data. Fig. 7a shows diffraction signals of (001), (002), (003), and (004) for the PbI2 thin film. After dipping the PbI2 in the MAI solution, the thin film presents the signals of perovskite of (110), (112), (211), (202), (220), (310), (312), (224), (411), (314), and (204) as shown in Fig. 7b. However, it still shows a very small amount of the PbI2 signals. In previous reports, little residual PbI2 is beneficial to the performance of perovskite and this result is consistent with our findings.53 After long-term aging, as shown in Fig. 7c, the signals of perovskite crystals disappear and the signals of PbI2 are presented. Furthermore, when the rejuvenating method was used to recharge the aging devices, we found that the hybrid signals of PbI2 and perovskite re-appeared. The results coincided with the evidence of the SEM, which implied that the better surface coverage was able to resist the invasion of oxygen and moisture.

4. Conclusions
We prepared a stable device, ITO/ZnO/perovskite/Spiro-OMe TAD/Au, in which we prove that high work function Au and planar ZnO structures are a good combination to improve the perovskite stability. The SEM, XRD and J–V curves reveal that the device is rejuvenated and recharged after 60 days. Here we propose for the first time a MAI assisted rechargeable and rejuvenation approach which could be stable for more than 100 days with a sustained PCE of 11%.
