    , Accepted 11th April 2013First published on 12th April 2013AbstractFabrication of single crystalline, oriented one-dimensional (1D) rods or wires of titania on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrates have enormous significance in the area of photoelectrochemical research owning to their unique optoelectronic properties. It is possible to modify the electrical conductivity and optoelectronic properties of titania by intentional inclusion of atomic impurity in the material. Here for the first time, we have doped lanthanum homogeneously in TiO2 nanorod arrays. The homogeneous distribution of lanthanum in titania lattice is confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) elemental mapping and line scanning analysis. After doping with lanthanum, there is a negative shift of the flat-band potential of the TiO2 nanorods and the charge carrier density of the nanorods is also improved. The energy-conversion efficiency of a dye-sensitized solar cell based on 4 mol% La-doped nanorods is increased about 21% compared with the undoped one.
Introduction
Oriented one dimensional (1D) metal oxide structures directly grown on substrates are of substantial interest due to their widespread application in fuel cells, Li-ion batteries, photoelectrochemical water splitting, solar cells etc.1–5 These nanorods or nanotubes based electrodes have been developed for various optoelectronic applications due to large aspect ratio and reduced grain boundary which favor efficient transport of charge carriers. There is a lot of interest in fabrication of 1D rods or wires of titania in desired crystalline facets due to their unique optoelectronic properties. The single crystalline, oriented nanorods directly grown on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrates have a number of applications in the area of solar photovoltaics and several other optoelectronic devices due to the enhanced electron transport and lower exciton recombination rates.5–10 By introducing doping impurities in the lattice structure, electrical and magnetic properties of these materials can be altered and manipulated. Doping is routinely performed in bulk semiconductors as well as nanoscale materials.11,12 Due to typical electronic configuration of Ti4+ ions in TiO2, it is possible to alter its optoelectronic properties by preferential doping with s, p, d, or f block elements. Thus, incorporation of atomic impurity in titania can tailor the band gap and electrical conductivity of the material.13 Usually, 1D nanorods are synthesized in non-equilibrium conditions. Various high temperature methods are used for this purpose. But it is very difficult to homogeneously dope any 1D structure. At high growth temperature homogeneous doping is really a hard job. In contrast, low temperature solvothermal method is useful for synthesis of doped nanostructures. The direct growth of single crystalline TiO2 nanorods on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates by hydrothermal and solvothermal method was first reported a few years ago14,15 followed by a general method to synthesize TiO2 rods on various substrates.5,16,17 The growth mechanism and dependence of morphology of titania nanorods on the surface chemistry of substrates have also been studied.5 The same method is useful for direct synthesis of homogeneously doped nanorods on substrates. Due to the low synthesis temperature the physical properties of the substrates will also remain unaffected. It is reported that doping of lanthanum with titanium ion can increase the oxygen vacancy of titania surface.18 In dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) the carboxylic group of the dye molecule is attached with titanium ion. More oxygen vacancy on the surface can led to more dye absorption which can enhance the photovoltaic performance of the cell. In this paper, for the first time, we have doped various amount of lanthanum homogeneously in TiO2 nanorod arrays directly grown on FTO substrates. The homogeneous distribution of lanthanum in titania lattice is confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) elemental mapping and line scanning analysis. The optical characteristics of the as-synthesized nanorods have been thoroughly studied through various experiments like UV-visible-DRS, photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy. The change of flat-band potential (VFB) and carrier density of the nanorods with doping has also been calculated through Mott–Schottky measurements. The photon to electron conversion efficiency of these La-doped TiO2 nanorods has also been measured after absorbing the nanorods in dye and fabricating liquid-junction dye-sensitized solar cells where these dye adsorbed nanorods were used as the photoanode.
Materials and methods
(A) Synthesis of TiO2 and La-doped TiO2 nanorods on FTO substrates
La-doped and undoped TiO2 nanorods were synthesized on polycrystalline FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide, sheet resistance = 8 ohm/square) coated glass substrates through solvothermal chemistry. For the doped one, titanium butoxide (TBOT) (purity ≥97%, Aldrich Co.) and lanthanum(III) nitrate hexahydrate (La(NO3)3·6H2O) (purity 99.99% Aldrich Co.) were used as precursor. In a typical synthesis process, first the substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in a mixed solution of deionised water, acetone and isopropanol and then dried in N2 flow. 30 mL H2O and 30 mL concentrated (35%) HCl was stirred for 10 min in a 100 mL Teflon vessel followed by the drop-wise addition of 1 mL titanium butoxide and various amounts of La(NO3)3·6H2O solution and stirring for another 10 min at room temperature. The substrates were placed horizontally within the Teflon vessel and the vessel was loaded inside a 100 mL autoclave for the hydrothermal reaction at 150 °C for 20 h in a furnace. After synthesis, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature and the substrates were washed vigorously with DI water and then dried in air.
(B) Fabrication of DSSC
To fabricate a solar cell, at first, the as-synthesized TiO2 nanorods on FTO substrate were annealed in air at 400 °C for 30 min. Then it was cooled to 80 °C and was immersed in a 0.5 mM ethanolic solution of N-719 dye (cisbis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyrridyl-4-4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium) (as-received from Solaronix Co.) for 24 h in order to enable sufficient adsorption of the dye which will act as the sensitizer in the presence of light. After completing the adsorption of the dye, the substrate was washed very carefully with ethanol and dried for 1 h. After that a platinum coated FTO substrate which will be used as the counter electrode was placed above the dye adsorbed FTO substrate and an electrolyte containing 0.6 M 1-hexyl-2-3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in methoxyacetonitrile was injected into the space between the anode and the cathode to complete the assembly of the DSSC.
(C) Characterization techniques
In order to confirm the crystalline phase of TiO2 nanorods, X-ray diffraction (XRD) study was performed using a PANalytical X′PERT PRO instrument and the iron-filtered Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) in the 2θ range of 10–80° with a step size of 0.02°. To analyze the shape and size of the synthesized nanorods scanning electron microscopy (FEI Quanta 200 environmental scanning microscope) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (FEI (model Tecnai F30) high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) equipped with a field emission source operating at 300 kV voltage to image TiO2 nanocrystals on carbon-coated copper TEM grid) were done. Optical properties of the as synthesized TiO2 nanorods were investigated by UV-visible spectrophotometer. UV-Vis-DRS spectroscopy measurements were performed on a Jasco UV-vis-NIR (Model V570) dual beam spectrometer operated at a resolution of 2 nm. PL spectra were acquired using a Fluorolog Horiba Jobin Yvon fluorescence spectrophotometer, equipped with a 400 W Xe lamp as an excitation source and a Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier tube (PMT) as a detector. Raman spectroscopy measurements were recorded at room temperature on an HR 800 Raman spectrophotometer (Jobin Yvon, Horiba, France) using monochromatic radiation emitted by a He–Ne laser (633 nm), operating at 20 mW. Mott-Schottky measurements were obtained in 3 M KCl solution at 298 K at frequency 10 KHz using a Solartron S1287 Electrochemical Interface and 1255 B Frequency Response Analyzer (Solartron Analytical, UK). Current–voltage characteristics were calculated by irradiating the cell with 100 mW cm−2 (450 W xenon lamp, Oriel instrument), 1 sun AM 1.5 G filter was used to simulate the solar spectrum. The active area of the cell was 0.5 cm2. The photocurrent was measured by using a Keithley 2400 source.
Results and discussion
In order to confirm the crystalline phase of La-doped TiO2 nanorods, XRD study was done. From the XRD, it is confirmed that the different mol% La-doped TiO2 nanorods grown on FTO substrates are in rutile phase. In Fig. 1, the XRD patterns of various amounts of La-doped and undoped TiO2 nanorods synthesized on FTO coated glass substrates, FTO coated glass substrate and PDF file # 21-1276 have been compared. It is clear from the diffraction peaks that the nanorods are highly oriented with respect to the substrate along the (002) plane. If the intensity of the (002) peak is compared with the standard TiO2 data (PDF data file #21-1276), it is found that the relative intensity of (002) peak is increased ∼10 times from ∼10% to 100%. From XRD pattern, it is confirmed that almost no peak-shift takes place as the amount of doping is very little. Thus, the presence of impurity phases such as La2O3 or La2Ti2O7 can be ruled-out which can be further proved from Raman and TEM analysis. As the size of La3+ (0.115 nm) ion is larger than Ti4+ (0.068 nm) ion, it is quite difficult for La3+ ions to enter into the lattice structure of TiO2. So, here the probability of formation of structural defect is less and for that reason lattice parameters of doped TiO2 nanorods will not change and almost no distortion will take place. In Fig. S1 in the ESI† the zoom view of the XRD patterns has been shown. In the zoom view too there is no noticeable peak shift in the doped nanorods. So from the XRD pattern it can be confirmed that the lattice parameters of the TiO2 nanorods remain unchanged after doping with lanthanum due to mismatch of ionic radius.

Fig. 2 and 3 represent the top and cross sectional view SEM images of various amounts of La-doped TiO2 nanorods grown on FTO substrates respectively. From the images it is confirmed that the nanorods are densely packed and perfectly oriented in the out-of-plane direction with respect to FTO. The substrates are evenly covered by the nanorods. It is clear from the figure that the top facets of the rods are square shaped which also supports the expected growth habit of tetragonal crystal. From the horizontal and cross sectional view of the images it is seen that the top surface of the as-synthesized rods are quite rough but the side walls of the nanorods are relatively smooth. A closer look of the images also exposed that the nanorods are consisted of a number of thinner nanowires. It is found that with increase in the amount of lanthanum dopant the density of the nanorod arrays decreased gradually. The average diameter, length and density of the as-grown nanorod arrays have been determined from the SEM images. The results are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI†. From an earlier report it was found that La-dopant can inhibit the growth of TiO2 nanocrystals.19 So, it can be assumed that as the amount of dopant concentration is increased in the growth solution, the nucleation density of the seed layer is decreased slowly and thus the compactness of the rods, grown on FTO substrates was minimized. Further, from EDX analysis the chemical stoichiometry of the TiO2 nanorods was estimated and the calculated data is shown in Table S2 (ESI†).

In order to study the formation and composition of the nanorods in detail, further structural characterization was carried out through TEM. Fig. 4 shows the TEM and HRTEM image of an individual representative 2 mol% La-doped TiO2 nanorod grown on FTO substrate. In Fig. 4(C) lattice fringes with interplanar spacing d101 = 0.24 nm corresponding to the rutile phase of titania can be identified clearly. No core/shell type structure was seen. Sharp and clean selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) for the nanorod grown on FTO substrate (Fig. 4(B)) was visualized nicely along [10] zone axis which was the inveterate evidence of the single crystallinity of the nanorods. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (Fig. 4(D)) of the high resolution phase contrast image (Fig. 4(C)) also confirms the single crystallinity of the nanorods. In Fig. 4(E) the reciprocal lattice points not corresponding to the c-plane were removed to further analyze the lattice structure. The remaining lattice points and the inverse FFT (IFFT) image are shown in Fig. 4(E) and 4(F) respectively. The IFFT image revealed a more clear structure with high crystallinity and minimal distortion.

(D) FFT pattern of the nanorod. (E) Reciprocal lattice points not corresponding to the c-plane has been removed. (F) Results of IFFT based on the lattice points shown in (E). 
STEM elemental mapping was done in order to inspect the distribution of lanthanum in the nanorods. In this technique, a two dimensional map of the samples can be visualized nicely where the relative location of individual element of a particular material can be spotted. Here through color intensity the relative amount of the element present can be judged. Fig. 5 shows the STEM image of 2 mol% La-doped TiO2 nanorod and corresponding elemental mapping of the as synthesized nanorod. In this figure the dark field image of an individual nanorod and the elemental maps of Ti–K and La–M are shown. The dark field image of the nanorod provides a reference to locate the particles in the elemental map. From the elemental mapping it was confirmed that lanthanum was distributed homogeneously throughout the rods. Thus from STEM and line scanning analysis (Fig. 5(D)) it can be proved that the as-synthesized TiO2 nanorods were homogeneously doped with lanthanum and no secondary phase was present.

In order to study the effect of La-doping on the optical properties of TiO2 nanorods the UV-vis-DRS spectra of the doped and undoped nanorods was measured. All the samples showed sharp absorption edge around 420 nm (Ebg ∼ 3.0 eV). It is found that the shape of the curve remained almost unchanged but with doping the amount of absorption increased (Fig. 6A). As discussed earlier due to huge size difference of La3+ and Ti4+ ions it is difficult to incorporate La3+ ions in TiO2 lattice and that is the main reason for not changing the absorption curve shape with doping. The increase in absorption may be due to the presence of surface state caused by oxygen vacancy.20,21 As lanthanum and titanium are in different valence states as a consequence, oxygen vacancies can be generated. All the doped and undoped samples exhibit a wide range of absorption below 420 nm. This can be due to band–band electron transition of the rutile TiO2 at its band gap energy i.e. around 3 eV. The tail around 420–500 nm can be attributed to the surface state.21 So it can be said that lanthanum doping did not give rise to any new spectral phenomena. Assuming that the rutile TiO2 nanorods possess a direct transition the band edge energy of the as-synthesized nanorods are calculated by plotting (αhν)2 against hν (where α is absorption coefficient and hν is photon energy). After calculating the band gap from the intercepts (Fig. 6B) it is found that with doping a little amount of red shift takes place from 3.0 eV to 2.9 eV.

Fig. 7 shows the photoluminescence property of the as synthesized doped and undoped TiO2 nanorods grown on FTO. It is known that if stable chemical state of dopant has half filled or full filled outer electron configuration then normally it will not generate a different PL phenomena as it is unable to capture electrons.22 So it is found that TiO2 and La-doped TiO2 exhibit similar type of PL signals with no difference in curve shape. The doped and undoped nanorods show strong and wide PL signal at a range from 400 to 500 nm at 380 nm excitation wavelength. The reason behind this wide range of PL emission may be attributed to binding excitons.19,20 The peak around 415 nm (∼2.98 eV) is due to band–band emission of rutile TiO2 nanorods as the photoexcited electrons radiatively return back from conduction band to valence band.20 The peak around 464 nm is the characteristic peak of rutile TiO2.23 The reason for this emission signal is due to metal–ligand charge transfer transition from Ti4+ to oxygen anion in TiO68− complex. Although the doped and undoped sample exhibit almost similar type curve shape but the PL intensity of the peaks can be heavily influenced as a result of the change in surface structure of the material due to alternation of oxygen vacancy.22,24 It is found that the PL intensity increased gradually as the amount of La-dopant increased. This trend is followed till the amount of La content is 3 mol%. But after that the intensity of the PL peaks decrease as the amount of dopant increases. The decrease in PL intensity can be due to the presence of a large number of Ti–O–La bonds which can decrease the content of surface oxygen vacancies. Moreover the effective area of TiO2 for absorbing light can be less.19

Fig. 8 shows the Raman spectra of TiO2 and La-doped TiO2 nanorods at room temperature. In both pure and doped samples the characteristic peaks for rutile TiO2 nanocrystals were found which again supports the formation of rutile structure. The two Raman active fundamental modes, Eg (∼444 cm−1) and A1g (∼610 cm−1) and the second order effect at ∼244 cm−1 due to multiple phonon vibration of B1g mode can be clearly distinguished.25,26 It is found that in La-doped sample the principle peak at 444 cm−1 gradually shifted to higher frequency (∼448 cm−1) up to 3 mol% and then again a slight red shift takes place at 4 mol% (∼442 cm−1). This peak shift can be a cause to an increase in oxygen vacancy which can also be proved from PL spectra.24 It also indicates that the Ti–O bond is slightly shorter and stronger due to bond contraction in case of lanthanum doping. No peak of La–O is seen in the spectra which supports the XRD result. It can be due to interstitial doping of lanthanum. For that reason La is incorporated in the interstitial site of TiO2 lattice.

Electrochemical impedance measurement was done to study the role of La-doping on the transport properties of the nanorods. Fig. 9 shows the Mott–Schottky plot of TiO2, 2 and 3 mol% La-doped TiO2 nanorods. All the samples show a positive slope which is the property of the n-type semiconductor.27 Compared to TiO2 nanorods the doped one showed smaller slopes which indicate that with doping charge carrier density increases. The flat-band potential (VFB) and carrier density of the doped and undoped nanorods were calculated from Mott–Schottky equation.1/C2 = (2/e0εε0Nd)[(V − VFB) − kT/e0]where e0 is the fundamental charge constant, ε the dielectric constant of TiO2, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, Nd the donor density, V the electrode applied potential, VFB the flat- band potential and kT/e0 is a temperature-dependent correction term. It was found from the calculation that with increase in doping concentration donor density increases. The calculated results are shown in Table 1. As no evidence of core/shell structure was found from TEM and STEM analysis the possibility of carrier concentration gradient can be ruled-out.

These single crystalline oriented nanorods grown on FTO substrates can effectively act as photoanode in sensitized solar cells. Due to the single crystalline structures of these nanorods rapid and efficient transfer of electrons take place from the sensitizer to collecting conducting substrate. Moreover, as the nanorods are directly synthesized on the transparent substrate, so more incident light can be passed through the backside of the photoelectrode and hence able to generate more photoelectrons. Fig. 10 shows the current density–voltage curves of the assembled solar cell under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The average performance characteristics of the cells in terms of short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and photoelectric conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 2. It is found that with doping VOC value increases from 0.704 V to 0.749 V. The increase in open circuit voltage is due to the elevation of flat band potential as conduction band edge of the doped TiO2 nanorods is shifted towards more negative potential. The JSC value also increases from 2.38 mA cm−2 to 3.81 mA cm−2 after doping. The plausible reason for increment of current density can be attributed to an increase of loading of more amount of dye. The photon to electron conversion efficiency of the TiO2 nanorods was increased ∼21% after doping with lanthanum. It is known that lanthanum doping can increase the oxygen vacancy of titania surface. The amount of dye adsorption can also be increased with increase in oxygen vacancy which might be a reason for this efficiency improvement. However, it is very difficult to know the precise reason for the increase in energy-conversion efficiency of DSSC, as betterment of the efficiency of a cell depends not only on the shape, size and inherent properties of the metal oxide materials used but also on various other parameters.

Conclusion
In summary, single crystalline oriented La-doped TiO2 nanorods have been synthesized on FTO substrates. Homogeneous doping of lanthanum throughout the nanorods has been proved by STEM analysis. Detailed optical studies of the as synthesized doped and undoped nanorods have been done through UV, PL and Raman spectroscopy. Electrochemical impedance measurement was done to investigate the band edge position and to know the trend of electron carrier density in the doped nanorods. The La-doped TiO2 nanorods have been successfully used as a photoanode in a DSSC. Photon to electron power conversion efficiency was increased by 21% after doping the TiO2 nanorods with 4 mol% lanthanum. This simple hydrothermal synthesis method can be applied considerably to homogeneously dope any metal cations with titanium ion. Systematic investigation of doping of metal cations with Ti4+ ions for synthesis of homogeneously doped single crystalline nanorods directly grown on substrates will provide valuable information for designing high-performance photoelectrochemical devices.
