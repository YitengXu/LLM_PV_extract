    , Accepted 30th April 2018First published on 1st May 2018AbstractLithium sulfide (Li2S) is considered as a promising lithium storage material because of its high theoretical specific capacity of 1166 mA h g−1. The electrochemical performance of Li2S can be remarkably improved by introducing carbon to form Li2S–carbon composites. However, the complex preparation process of Li2S–carbon composites limits their large-scale applications. Herein, we present a green and facile strategy to synthesize porous carbon-coated Li2S–carbon nanotube composites (Li2S@PC–CNT) by heating carbon disulfide (CS2) and the lithium hydride–CNT mixture at a temperature below 250 °C, which is the lowest temperature for in situ synthesis of Li2S–carbon composites reported till date. For the Li2S@PC–CNT composites, Li2S@PC particles are connected with neighboring particles through the 3D CNTs network skeleton. This unique nanoarchitecture not only prevents the loss of active materials and diffusion of polysulfides, but also significantly facilitates fast electron and ion transport. As a result, a high specific capacity (820 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 10 cycles) and a remarkable cycle life (502 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 300 cycles) are achieved. The rationally designed structure and superior electrochemical performance of the Li2S@PC–CNT composites will pave a new avenue for realizing high energy density of Li–S batteries.
Introduction
Environmental deterioration coupled with resource depletion have accelerated the process of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. Tremendous attention has been paid to developing wind energy, solar power, geothermal energy and hydro-energy as renewable and alternative energy sources.1–5 The intermittent and/or regional problems of these renewable sources are believed to be easily solved by employing high-performance rechargeable battery systems for energy storage. Therefore, rechargeable batteries are crucial for the large-scale applications of renewable energy sources. Lithium–ion batteries (LIBs), as one of the most important commercial rechargeable batteries, have been used as power sources for portable electronic devices, electric vehicles and grid-based energy storage system.6–10 However, the energy density of currently available commercial LIBs is less than 400 W h kg−1 owing to their reversible lithium storage in the intercalation-type cathode (i.e., lithium transition-metal oxide) and anode (i.e., graphite),11 thus failing to meet the ever-increasing demand for the onboard LIBs with higher energy densities. Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising rechargeable batteries with high energy density due to their theoretical energy density being as high as 2600 W h kg−1 or 2800 W h L−1.12,13 Moreover, the cathode material sulfur is naturally abundant, very cheap and environmentally benign as compared with the lithium transition-metal oxide cathode of LIBs.14–16
After full lithiation, active sulfur is converted into Li2S through a multielectron reaction mechanism. A large volume expansion (∼80%) is inevitable in the electrochemical lithiation process of sulfur. The fully lithiated product of Li2S is at the maximum volume state. Thus, the unstable electrical contact and structural integrity of electrodes, mainly originating from the large volume expansion during repeated lithiation/delithiation, can be overcome by substituting sulfur active material with Li2S.14,17 In addition, the Li2S cathode can be coupled with lithium-free anodes (such as graphite, silicon and tin) to form LIBs, alleviating the safety hazards caused by lithium dendrites.18,19 However, the commercial application of Li2S cathode is greatly hindered by the low electronic conductivity of fully lithiated/delithiated products and the high solubility of lithium polysulfide intermediates in organic electrolytes. Various strategies, including introducing conductive carbons, coating polymers or sulfides and adopting new electrolytes,14,20–25 have been proposed to address the abovementioned problems. Among them, combining Li2S with conductive carbons to form Li2S–carbon composites is considered as the most promising strategy because the low-density nanocarbons possess good electronic and ionic conductivity,14,26 controllable microstructures and morphologies,26,27 and good interfacial compatibility with active materials.28,29
In the view of the combination of Li2S with carbon, Li2S–carbon composites can be prepared by four methods: (i) physically mixing Li2S with carbon;30,31 (ii) wrapping Li2S in carbon;29,32 (iii) encapsulating a Li2S core in a carbon shell;30,33 and (iv) anchoring Li2S on the surface of carbon.34,35 Among these, fabricating the core–shell structure has been demonstrated to be the most efficient method to suppress the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides.26,30 A two-step method consisting of the synthesis of Li2S and subsequent introduction of carbon from carbonaceous precursors is the widely applied route to synthesize Li2S–carbon composites with the core–shell structure (Li2S@C), but this method still has several formidable challenges. First, commercial Li2S is very expensive because of its complex preparation process and the tedious solid–liquid separation.26,27 Generally, the widely reported synthetic strategy of Li2S is based on the chemical reaction between sulfur and lithium triethylborohydride (LiEt3BH) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) under argon atmosphere.26,33 This complex preparation process and harsh reaction conditions restrict the large-scale applications of Li2S in Li–S batteries. Second, the formation process of the core–shell structure of Li2S@C is usually accompanied with toxic and harmful gas emissions due to the pyrolysis reaction of the organic substances.33,36 Finally, since this is a multistep reaction, the overall preparation is time-consuming and the microstructure and morphology of the obtained Li2S@C, particularly the particle size of Li2S, is difficult to control.30 Therefore, it is crucial to develop a facile, green and one-step strategy to fabricate Li2S@C composites with excellent electrochemical performances for advanced Li–S batteries.
Very recently, in our pioneering study, we reported a green and facile strategy to synthesize porous carbon through a self-propagating reaction between LiH and CO2 (4LiH(s) + CO2(g) → C(s) + 2Li2O(s) + 2H2(g)),37 which opens up a new avenue for tackling energy crisis and greenhouse effect at the same time. Inspired by this study, we herein designed a new and facile route to synthesize porous carbon-coated Li2S composites (Li2S@PC) by reacting LiH with CS2 at an extremely low temperature below 200 °C. To further improve the electrical contact between Li2S@PC particles and the structural integrity of Li2S cathodes, CNTs were introduced to fabricate Li2S@PC–CNT composites. Our results demonstrate that CNTs are tightly embedded in the Li2S@PC particles and linked the neighbored Li2S@PC particles, which served as a highly conductive network skeleton. Owing to this unique microstructure, the Li2S@PC–CNT composites exhibit good electrical contact, stable structural integrity and excellent electrochemical lithium storage performance.
Results and discussion
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the rationally designed Li2S@PC–CNT composites were synthesized by a facile one-step strategy in a homemade reactor. During the heat-treatment from room temperature (RT) to 250 °C, Li2S@PC–CNT composites were produced by reacting LiH with CS2 in the presence of CNTs. A detailed description of the synthesis procedure can be found in the Experimental section. The sample temperatures in the sealed reactor were monitored by a thermocouple. Fig. 2a shows the time dependence of the sample temperatures in the synthesis process of Li2S@PC–CNT composites. The sample temperature elevated to 297 °C in 5 s after the sample was heated from RT to 174 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the lowest reaction temperature and the shortest reaction time reported to date for the in situ synthesis of Li2S–carbon composites (Fig. 2d).34–36,38–40 The very rapid increase in the sample temperatures implies the exothermic nature of the fast chemical reactions involved in the synthesis of Li2S@PC–CNT composites. At the same synthesis conditions as mentioned above, CNT is found to not react with LiH and CS2 during both mixing and heating processes (Fig. S1†). The same exothermic phenomenon is also observed in the heating process of the LiH–CS2 mixture (Fig. 2b). These results suggest that LiH may react with CS2 to release a large amount of heat within 5 s and produce Li2S and C on the conductive network skeleton of CNT.

The solid products of the exothermic reactions were further analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Fig. 2c). The XRD peaks of Li2S phase are detected in both Li2S@PC and Li2S@PC–CNT composites, implying that Li2S can be obtained by reacting LiH with CS2. It should be noted that the XRD peaks attributed to CNTs cannot be observed in the XRD patterns since the crystallinity degree of CNTs is very low (Fig. S1†). Moreover, the compositions of the obtained solid products from the abovementioned exothermic reactions were confirmed by elemental analysis using an elemental analyzer. As shown in Table S1,† carbon can be clearly detected in the solid products and the carbon contents in Li2S@PC–CNT and Li2S@PC are 31.5 and 11.3 wt%, respectively. Additionally, hydrogen (H2) is desorbed in the synthesis process of Li2S@PC–CNT and Li2S@PC composites (Fig. S2 and S3†).
Based on the aforementioned analysis, the chemical reaction involved in the in situ synthesis of Li2S@PC composites can be described as follows: 4LiH(s) + CS2(g) → 2Li2S(s) + C(s) + 2H2(g)(1)
According to eqn (1), the theoretical carbon content of Li2S@PC and Li2S@PC–CNT composites are 11.6 and 32.3 wt%, respectively, which are very close to their respective experimental values. The standard formation enthalpies of the reactants and products (Table S2†) were adopted to calculate the enthalpy changes of chemical reactions. The reaction heat of eqn (1) is 637.5 kJ mol−1. The exothermic nature of eqn (1) is in good agreement with the very rapid increase in the sample temperatures in the synthesis of Li2S–carbon composites (Fig. 2a and b). However, the exothermic reaction between LiH and CS2 can only occur at the temperature above ∼196 °C (Fig. 2b) due to the high kinetic barrier. The thermodynamic and kinetic properties of eqn (1) are quite similar to those of our reported reaction between LiH and CO2.37
The morphologies of Li2S–carbon composites were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). As depicted in Fig. 3a, the one-dimensional (1D) CNTs have cross-linked networks in three dimensions. Defects and non-uniformities in the CNT networks may serve as nuclei for the formation of Li2S@PC–CNT composites. After introducing Li2S@PC, the three-dimensional (3D) networks of CNTs can also be clearly seen in Li2S@PC–CNT composites (Fig. 3b and c). The Li2S@PC particles are well connected with neighboring particles through the 3D CNTs network skeleton. Consequently, the particle size of Li2S@PC–CNT is greater than that of Li2S@PC (Fig. S4†). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images reveal that the particle size of Li2S ranges from 5 nm to 15 nm. In addition, these Li2S nanoparticles are tightly embedded in the porous carbon (Fig. 3d–f). Furthermore, the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) results (Fig. S5†) show an uneven distribution of sulfur and carbon, demonstrating the uneven distribution of Li2S in the Li2S@PC–CNT composite. As reported in the literature,26,30 such core–shell structure composed of Li2S (core) and carbon (shell) will be favorable to boost the electric conductivity of Li2S and retard the migration of the intermediate polysulfides (Li2Sn, 4 ≤ n ≤ 8) into the organic electrolyte. Interestingly, the cross-linked CNTs network can be vividly observed in Li2S@PC–CNT composites, which can function as a conductive network skeleton to connect the neighboring nanosized-Li2S@PC particles. Such highly porous carbon may be ascribed to the H2 blowing effect originating from the reaction between LiH and CS2 during the in situ synthesis process.37,41

Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured to characterize the porosity of Li2S@PC and Li2S@PC–CNT. As shown in Fig. 4a, both Li2S@PC and Li2S@PC–CNT samples display a typical type IV adsorption–desorption curve, corresponding to the mesoporous feature.37,42 As shown in Fig. 4b, the size distribution of mesopores within the Li2S@PC–CNT sample is centered at ca. 3.8 nm, which is almost the same as the mesopore size distribution in the Li2S@PC sample. Furthermore, a uniform distribution of pores with size in the range of 5–90 nm is observed. The introduction of CNTs into Li2S@PC leads to an increase in the size of mesopores in the range of 10–70 nm. The ratio of the volume of mesopores to the total volume of pores is 0.22 cm3 g−1, indicating that abundant mesopores are present in Li2S@PC–CNT composites. The specific surface area of Li2S@PC–CNT composites is calculated to be 68.2 m2 g−1.

The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of Li2S@PC–CNT composites are shown in Fig. 5a. It has been reported that a high initial charging voltage can be applied to overcome the kinetic barrier of the conversion reactions from Li2S to polysulfides.27,43 In our study, a cutoff voltage of 3.8 V was used to electrochemically activate Li2S in the first delithiation process. A multistep oxidation reaction from Li2S to S occurs in the first anodic scanning as the continuous multi-peak curve is detected in the voltage range from 2.4 to 3.8 V (Fig. 5a), indicating a high kinetic barrier to the electrochemical activation of Li2S. However, it should be noted that the activation voltage of the Li2S@PC–CNT sample is lower than that of our Li2S@C composites synthesized by the ex situ two-step method,44 suggesting that the decrease in particle size of Li2S accelerates the activation kinetics of the composites. Compared with those of the Li2S@PC–CNT sample, broader voltage range and higher activation voltage can be found in the initial activation process of the Li2S@PC sample (Fig. S6†). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was further used to investigate the electronic and ionic conductivity. Fig. 5b displays the Nyquist plots of the Li2S@PC and Li2S@PC–CNT electrodes at the fresh state. It can be seen that the introduction of CNTs increases electronic and ionic conductivity of the Li2S@PC electrode. The CV and EIS results indicate that both the decrease in particle size of Li2S and the increase in electronic and ionic conductivity may be responsible for the decrease in activation voltages of the Li2S@PC–CNT electrode in the initial charging process.26,43

(c) Voltage–capacity profiles of Li2S@PC–CNT and Li2S@PC electrodes at different cycles. (d) Cyclic performance comparison of Li2S@PC–CNT and Li2S@PC electrodes at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. The mass loading of Li2S was ca. 1.34 and 1.73 mg for the electrode with 31.8 and 14.6 wt% carbon, respectively. 
In the subsequent cathodic scanning cycles, the Li2S@PC–CNT electrode shows the typical redox peaks of S electrode in the voltage window of 1.5–3.0 V. Two reduction peaks at around 2.3 and 2.0 V are attributed to the formation of soluble lithium polysulfides (Li2Sn, 4 ≤ n ≤ 8) and the further conversion to insoluble Li2S2/Li2S, respectively.45,46 Conversely, an oxidation peak at around 2.4 V corresponds to the transformation from Li2S to S.46,47 After the first cycle, the Li2S@PC–CNT sample presents good electrochemical reversibility for lithium storage (Fig. 5a) since the succeeding CV curves are well overlapped.

Fig. 5c shows the charge–discharge profiles of the Li2S@PC–CNT and Li2S@PC electrodes in the initial three cycles. In order to electrochemically activate Li2S, the cutoff voltage and current density were set to 3.8 V and 0.05 A g−1, respectively, in the first charging process. Apparently, the charge and discharge voltage plateaus of Li2S@PC–CNT and Li2S@PC are consistent with the CV results (Fig. 5a). It should be noted that the Li2S@PC–CNT electrode displays lower irreversible capacity of 134 mA h g−1 than that of the Li2S@PC electrode (329 mA h g−1), which could be attributed to the improved electronic conductivity of the Li2S@PC–CNT composites achieved by introducing the 3D network skeleton of CNTs. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 5d, the Li2S@PC–CNT electrode can not only deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 1017 mA h g−1, but also retain a good discharge capacity of 683 mA h g−1 (equal to 981 mA h g−1 sulfur) after 50 cycles. It should be noted that the initial discharge capacity is 87.2% of the theoretical capacity of Li2S (1166 mA h g−1), implying the high utilization of Li2S in the Li2S@PC–CNT electrode. In contrast, the Li2S@PC electrode has lower initial discharge capacity of 716 mA h g−1 as compared with that of Li2S@PC–CNT electrode at 0.1 A g−1. Moreover, the initial coulombic efficiencies of the Li2S@PC–CNT and Li2S@PC electrodes are 88.3% and 68.5%, respectively, in the initial cycles, which gradually increase to 97% and 93%, respectively after 5 cycles. The higher coulombic efficiency and lithium storage capacity of the Li2S@PC–CNT electrode may result from the unique 3D CNT network structure. In order to prove our hypothesis, the Li2S@PC electrode with the same carbon content as that of the Li2S@PC–CNT electrode was prepared by adding carbon black into the Li2S@PC composite. As shown in Fig. 5d, the coulombic efficiencies and lithium storage capacities of this electrode are higher than those of the Li2S@PC electrode with lower carbon content, but lower than those of the Li2S@PC–CNT electrode. This result indicates that both the 3D network structure of CNTs and the increase in carbon content (CNT) are responsible for the improved lithium storage performance of the Li2S@PC–CNT electrode.
The rate performance of the Li2S@PC–CNT and Li2S@PC electrodes were further evaluated at various current densities. As presented in Fig. 6a, the reversible capacities of Li2S@PC–CNT at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1 A g−1 are 875, 748, 645 and 573 mA h g−1, respectively. Although the specific capacity of the Li2S@PC–CNT electrode slightly decreases along with an increase in current density, a remarkable reversible capacity of 766 mA h g−1 still can be restored when the current density is returned to 0.1 A g−1. The rate capability of Li2S@PC–CNT is clearly superior to that of Li2S@PC. Furthermore, the long-term cycling performance comparison between the Li2S@PC–CNT and Li2S@PC electrodes was conducted at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 (Fig. 6b). Li2S@PC–CNT can deliver high reversible capacities of 583 mA h g−1 and 502 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles and 300 cycles, respectively. However, the Li2S@PC composites present lower reversible capacities of 356 mA h g−1 at the 100th cycle and 321 mA h g−1 at the 300th cycle (Fig. 6b). To examine the microstructural stability during cycling, the Li2S@PC–CNT electrodes at different cycles were collected for FESEM observation. As the number of charge–discharge cycles increases, the surface of the Li2S@PC–CNT electrode gradually becomes even or smooth, resulting from the chemical interaction between the electrolytes and electrode materials (Fig. 7a–c). After 300 cycles, the 3D CNT network can be still observed in the Li2S@PC–CNT composites detached from the current collector (Fig. 7d), indicating good structural stability during repeated delithiation/lithiation. These results demonstrate that the Li2S@PC–CNT electrode has excellent cycling performance owing to its unique microstructure and structural stability. Nowadays, the high mass loading of sulfur electrode is an important criterion for the high energy density of Li–S batteries in practical applications. As illustrated in Fig. 6c, the thick Li2S@PC–CNT electrode with a high mass loading of 7.5 mg cm−2 still delivers the satisfactory reversible capacities of 504 and 431 mA h g−1 at 0.5 and 1.0 A g−1, respectively, even after 100 cycles.

The carbon content of the Li2S@PC–CNT electrode is determined to be 31.8 wt%. In comparison with that of other Li2S–carbon electrodes (Table S3†), the carbon content of this Li2S@PC–CNT electrode is among the lowest considering both carbon black of the conductive agent and carbon contained in the Li2S–carbon composites. The Li2S content in the Li2S@PC–CNT electrode is not the highest, but much higher than the average values reported in other papers (Table S3†). The as-synthesized Li2S@PC–CNT electrode with the 3D network structure exhibits high reversible lithium storage capacities, good cycling performance and improved rate capability (Table S3 and Fig. S7†). This excellent electrochemical performance of the Li2S@PC–CNT electrode can be mainly attributed to the synergistic effects of carbon-coated Li2S and the 3D CNT network. On the one hand, the carbon coating on the surface of Li2S nanoparticles could significantly improve the electronic conductivity of Li2S and alleviate the shuttle effect of polysulfides and volume change during the electrochemical reaction. On the other hand, the 3D network skeleton of CNTs could tightly connect Li2S@PC particles to enhance the structural integrity of the Li2S@PC–CNT composites and at the same time, serve as steady “highways” to accelerate electron transport.
Conclusions
In summary, a facile, rapid and environmentally benign strategy was developed to prepare the Li2S@PC–CNT composites via the one-pot exothermic reaction between CS2 and LiH. This in situ synthesis method generated a unique core–shell structure of Li2S@PC, in which the core of Li2S nanoparticle was tightly encapsulated by the shell of porous carbon. As a result, the electronic conductivity of Li2S is greatly enhanced and the shuttle effect of polysulfides also can be well suppressed. Most importantly, the introduced CNTs served as the 3D network skeleton to connect the Li2S@PC particles and provide “highways” for the fast electron transfer. Owing to the synergistic effects, this rationally designed Li2S@PC–CNT composite exhibits high capacity (683 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 50 cycles), superior rate performance and excellent cycling stability (502 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 300 cycles). We believe that this green and efficient strategy could be generalized to other Li2S@PC/carbon composites (such as Li2S@PC/graphene and Li2S@PC/porous carbon) for advanced Li–S batteries.
Experimental section
Chemical reagents and pre-treatment
LiH powder (97%, Alfa Aesar), CNTs (XF NANO) and anhydrous CS2 solution (99%, Aladdin) were used as received. Before use, CNTs were dried under vacuum at 300 °C for 5 h to remove moisture completely. All samples were handled inside an argon-filled glovebox (MBRAUN) with the O2 and H2O levels maintained below 0.5 ppm.
Materials synthesis
Initially, 0.2 g LiH and 4 mL CS2 solution were loaded into a stainless-steel reactor (∼30 mL) and then heated to 250 °C. After the reaction, the products were treated at 250 °C under vacuum for 3 h to degas the excessive CS2. The synthesis of Li2S@PC–CNT is same as that for Li2S@PC, except the use of 0.2 g mixture (0.1 g LiH and 0.1 g CNT) instead of 0.2 g LiH.
Characterization
The crystal structures of the obtained samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert Pro diffractometer, Cu Kα, λ = 1.5418 Å) with a 2θ range of 10–80°. The carbon content of Li2S@PC and Li2S@PC–CNT was determined on an elemental analyzer (Vario Macro Cube). The composition of the generated gas was identified by a mass spectrometer (QIC-20, Hiden). The morphology was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI, Nova NanoSEM 450) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI, TF20). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption tests were performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer. The specific surface area was determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model. The pore diameter distributions were calculated based on the Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model.
Electrochemical measurement
The working electrode was fabricated as follows. For the Li2S@PC electrode with 14.6 wt% carbon and the Li2S@PC–CNT cathode, the active materials (i.e., Li2S@PC and Li2S@PC–CNT) were mixed with Super-P and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder at a weight ratio of 85:5:10. For the Li2S@PC electrode with 31.8 wt% carbon, the corresponding weight ratio was set as 65.6:24.4:10. N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was used as a solvent to form a uniform slurry. The slurry was deposited on an aluminum foil and then dried under an Ar atmosphere at 120 °C for 5 h. The Li2S mass loading of each thin electrode was ca. 1.34–1.73 mg. For the thick electrode, the mass loading was ca. 7.73 mg. The CR2025 coin-type cells were assembled in a glovebox to evaluate the electrochemical performance. A lithium foil and a Celgard 2400 polymer membrane were served as a counter electrode and a separator, respectively. The electrolyte was composed of 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI, 98%, Alfa Aesar) salt dissolved in dimethoxyethane (DME, 99%, Alfa Aesar, 50 vol%) and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL, 99.5%, Alfa Aesar, 50 vol%) solvents with LiNO3 additive (99%, Alfa Aesar, 1 wt%). The electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio was controlled to ∼30 and ∼11 μL mg−1 for thin and thick electrodes, respectively. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on a CHI650B electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai) with a fresh cell from the open-circuit voltage to 3.8 V and then between 1.5 and 3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. The galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were performed on a Neware battery test system (Shenzhen Neware Battery, China) at room temperature. The initial charging process was started from the open-circuit voltage and ended at 3.8 V with a current density of 0.05 A g−1. Following this, all the charge and discharge cycles were tested in the voltage range of 1.8–2.85 V. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was carried out on a CHI650B electrochemical workstation with the frequency range of 105–10−2 Hz.
