    , Accepted 11th June 2023First published on 29th June 2023AbstractIn this study, we aim to change the number of anchoring groups and their spacers on zinc(II) phthalocyanine (ZnPc) rings to improve the performance of ZnPcs used as photosensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). For this purpose, two new A3B type asymmetric ZnPcs are achieved using a statistical condensation method with a different number of 2,4-di-tert-butyl-6-(3,4-dicyanophenoxy)benzoic acid, 4-(2,4-di-tert-butylphenoxy), and 4-(6-carboxy-2-naphthoxy) moieties on the peripheral positions of Pc rings. The structures of these novel asymmetric phthalocyanines were elucidated by spectroscopic methods such as elemental analysis, MALDI-TOF MS, 1H-NMR, FT-IR, and UV-Vis, and then electrochemical analysis. The electrochemical data show that both ZnPcs undergo one oxidation and three reduction reactions whose positions are slightly altered with the substituents' different electron-releasing/withdrawing features. In situ spectroelectrochemical results are used to assign the electron transfer reactions to the Pc-based processes of both ZnPcs. The positions of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) which are derived from the first reduction and oxidation couples indicate their appropriateness as photosensitizers in DSSCs. The photovoltaic data indicate the significant role of the nature of the spacer groups and the number of anchoring groups in the electron transfer from the photo-excited ZnPcs into the semiconductor on the anode of the DSSC, which enhances the efficiency of the DSSC. ZnPc(6) bearing three benzoic acid and naphthoic acid anchoring groups, three benzene spacers and one naphthalene spacer exhibits higher open circuit potential (VOC) (760 mV), current density (JSC) (9.97 mA cm−2) and FF (41%), incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) (50%), and power conversion efficiency (η) (2.97%), than ZnPc(7) bearing three benzoic acid anchoring groups and three benzene spacers.
1. Introduction
Metallo phthalocyanines (MPcs) have been intensely investigated as functional materials in diversified electro–optical applications like sensors,1–3 electrochromophores,4–6 photocatalysts,7,8 and sensitizers in various light-to-energy conversion devices.9–11 These complexes have superior features when harvesting light within the wide region of the solar spectrum from UV to IR with very high molecular extinction coefficients. Additionally, their rich redox activity and the possibility of their redox responses by manipulation with more than 70 metallic cations in the Pc core and numerous peripheral, non-peripheral, and axial substituents enhance their functionality in desired application fields.1,12,13 Recently, MPcs have been intensively studied in DSSCs as sensitizers; however, there are only a few reports that have a greater value than 3% for efficiency14–16 due to some handicaps such as preventing injection of electrons efficiently into the semiconducting band and hole transport to the electrolyte due to the π–π supramolecular interactions (J- or H-aggregates), misappropriation of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, adsorption geometry and orientation of the sensitizers.16–18 As a solution for these problems, many MPcs have been synthesised by using various substituent environments and metal centers. As an example, Cid et al. used tert-butyl substituents to diminish aggregation and used different carboxylic anchoring groups to facilitate the electron injection and reached an outstanding IPCE (80%) and power conversion efficiency (η) (3.52) with ZnPc bearing three tert-butyl and one carboxylic acid substituents at the peripheral positions of Pc.16 In another paper, Eu et al. reported η of 0.57% and 4.9% maximal IPCE with a zinc phthalocyanine carboxylic acid (ZnPc) that was heavily substituted.19 Giribabu and his coworkers prepared three sterically demanding unsymmetrical zinc phthalocyanines with different nonaggregating groups and different carboxylic acid-based anchoring groups and reported a maximum η of 1.01%.20 Recently, Yıldız and his coworkers obtained η of 2.52% with the DSSC bearing an unsymmetrical zinc phthalocyanine dye that contains six electron-donating hexyl sulfanyl groups and a pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid anchoring group with a bridging oxygen atom.21 When the oxygen bridging between the pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid and the Pc ring was removed, the power conversion efficiency was enhanced by up to 2.52% due to the electron injection from Pc to the semiconductor being facilitated.22 To enhance the performance of DSSC-bearing MPcs, we recently reported a series of MPcs bearing different metal cations, anchoring and spacer groups23,24 and we reached a maximum efficiency of 3.97% in power conversion with DSSC-bearing TiOPc peripherally substituted with tetra-4-carboxyethylenephenoxy.25 As a continuity of our studies, we aim to increase the performance of DSSCs with new ZnPcs decorated with different anchoring and spacer groups to increase the performance we have achieved so far. For this reason, we prepared A3B type asymmetric ZnPc(6) bearing three benzoic acid and naphthoic acid anchoring groups, three benzene spacers, one naphthalene spacer and ZnPc(7) bearing three benzoic acid snchoring groups and one benzene spacer. Then we performed detailed electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and photovoltaic analyses to study their DSSC performance.
2. Experimental
An argon inert gas atmosphere and anhydrous solvents were utilized in the reactions within the scope of the study. 4-Nitrophthalonitrile (1) and 3,5-di-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (2) were used as supplied commercially. 4-(6-Carboxy-2-naphthoxy) phthalonitrile (4) and 4-(2,4-di-tert-butylphenoxy) phthalonitrile (5) were obtained according to the literature.26,27 (For more details, please see the ESI†.)
2.1. Synthesis and characterization

2.1.1. 2,4-di-tert-butyl-6-(3,4-dicyanophenoxy)benzoic acid (3). 
1.45 g (5.8 mmol) of 3,5-di-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (2) and 1.0 g (5.8 mmol) of 4-nitrophthalonitrile (1) were mixed in 40 mL of dry DMSO. 2.40 g (17.4 mmol) of K2CO3 was added to the reaction and stirred for 76 hours at 70 °C under an argon atmosphere. The reaction progress was controlled regularly by TLC. After leaving the reaction mixture to cool down to 25 °C, it was added to 150 mL of ice water and stirred for 15 minutes. By adding HCl (1:1, v/v) slowly to the solution, the pH was decreased to 1. After filtering the precipitate and washing it multiple times with cold water, the filtrate pH was changed to 7. The substance was dried at 50 °C under vacuum and then the cream-colored raw substance was crystallized using cold methanol. The new ligand obtained from the reaction is soluble in acetone, DCM (dichloromethane), THF, DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide), DMF (dimethylformamide), and chloroform.

2.2. Electrochemical, in situ spectroelectrochemical, and photovoltaic measurements
CV (cyclic voltammetry), SWV (square wave voltammetry), and CPC (controlled potential coulometry) analyses were performed by following the procedures provided in the literature by using a Gamry Reference 600 Potentiostat/Galvanostat in a standard three-electrode cell.23,28 A Pt wire counter electrode, a GCE working electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode were utilized as a three-electrode system in the DMSO/TBAP electrolyte at room temperature. DSSC measurements were completed by following the procedures provided in the literature.24 Detailed electrochemical and DSSC measurement procedures are given in the ESI.† First of all, a TiO2 paste was applied to the clean surface of FTO glass (active square area: 25 mm2) with the doctor-blade technique. Then FTO/TiO2 was immersed in 0.4 mM ZnPcs dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solutions and ZnPcs were adsorbed to the electrode for 24 h and used as the photoanodes. Pt-coated FTO glasses were used as the cathode of the DSSCs. The spacer allowed for the creation of a sandwiching cell structure. Iodolyte AN-50 liquid was used as the electrolyte of the cells.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and characterization
The new ligand, 2,4-di-tert-butyl-6-(3,4-dicyanophenoxy)benzoic acid (3), was obtained by base-catalyzed nucleophilic aromatic nitro displacement reaction of compound 1 and 2 in the presence of K2CO3 as the base in dry DMF under an argon atmosphere at 70 °C for 76 h in 71% yield. New asymmetric zinc phthalocyanines (6 and 7), including di-tert-butyl phenoxy units with carboxyl anchor groups at the peripheral regions, were synthesized, respectively, by reacting the new phthalonitrile compound (3) with ligands of 4 and 5 in DMF and the presence of DBU at 175 °C under an inert atmosphere (Scheme 1). The phthalocyanines synthesized were purified by column chromatography (CH2Cl2:ethanol (100/1, v/v)). The obtained new asymmetric phthalocyanine compounds (6 and 7) containing carboxyl anchor groups were synthesized with 12% and 13% yield, and their characteristic structures were elucidated by elemental analysis, FT-IR, UV-Vis, 1H-NMR, and MALDI-TOF MS. Then, the spectroelectrochemical, electrochemical, and dye-sensitized solar cell features of these compounds were investigated. The structure of the ligand (3) and the formation of metal complexes (6 and 7) were confirmed by all the applied analytical and spectral methods.

When the FT-IR spectra of compounds 1 and 3 were compared, it was seen that the targeted structure was achieved. In the IR spectrum of ligand 3, NO2 bands disappeared at 1535 cm−1 and 1350 cm−1, while the Ar–O–Ar band was seen at 1233 cm−1. The –OH peaks of the carboxy groups seen between 3600–2500 cm−1 and the carbonyl –CO peaks appearing at 1714 cm−1 and 1717 cm−1 in the FT-IR spectra of the 6 and 7 complexes, respectively, prove that carboxyl groups are present in these structures. In the IR spectrum of 3–5, the powerful –CN band, respectively at 2233, 2234, and 2230 cm−1,26,27 disappeared after the conversion to metallophthalocyanines (6 and 7). The peak bands of stretching vibration belonging to groups of Ar–H, alkyl –CH, and Ar–O–Ar in the phthalocyanines were seen at 3063–3064 cm−1, 2831–2971 cm−1, and 1220–1224 cm−1, respectively. 1H-NMR spectra of all the compounds taken in d6-DMSO confirm their intended molecular structures. When evaluating the 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 3, the proton of the carboxylic acid group δ 12.07 ppm′ was seen, while the 5 aromatic protons of the compound were detected within the range of δ 8.23–7.48 ppm. The peaks that appear as singlets at δ 1.38 and 1.25 ppm belong to the protons of the t-Bu(CH3)3 groups in the ligand 3 compound (Fig. 1a). In the 1H-NMR spectra of 6 and 7 the aromatic protons appeared as a broad band at δ 8.66–7.39 and δ 8.67–6.97 ppm and –OH protons were observed at δ 13.05 and δ 12.36 ppm, respectively. In the 1H-NMR spectra, two singlets at 1.89 and 1.74 ppm for 6 were visible as protons taking part in every t-Bu(CH3)3 group, while they were seen as four singlets at 1.85, 1.79, 1.61 and 1.57 ppm for 7 (Fig. 1b and c).

Intense electron delocalization in phthalocyanines produces sharp absorption peaks in the UV-Vis region. Thanks to these peaks, it is understood whether the formation and structure of the phthalocyanine compound is metal or non-metal. Phthalocyanine compounds in solution give a Q band between 700 and 600 nm and B or Soret band between 400 and 300 nm. The Soret band is the characteristic phthalocyanine band that corresponds to the π → π* transitions and is seen around 300 nm.29 Considering the UV-Vis spectra in DMSO of asymmetric zinc phthalocyanines (6 and 7) including carboxyl anchoring groups, Q bands appeared at 676 nm and 681 nm and also weak shoulder-shaped absorption bands were seen at 611 and 612 nm, respectively (Fig. 2). When we compare the spectra of the two compounds, the 6-carboxy-2-naphtoxy groups in compound 6 caused the Q band to shift in blue color in the absorption spectrum. Shifting of the Q and B bands to red color is caused by electron-donating groups in phthalocyanine compounds, while electron-withdrawing groups shift to blue.30,31 In the UV-Vis spectra of 6 and 7, B bands were also seen at 340 and 352 nm in the given order.

When the aggregation behaviors of complexes 6 and 7 were examined in DMSO in the concentration range of 2 × 10−6 and 12 × 10−6 mol dm−3, it was observed that they did not exhibit any aggregation. At increased concentrations, the absorption intensity of the Q bands was also incremented. The Beer–Lambert law was followed for both compounds at varying concentrations. These electronic spectra show the non-aggregating forms of phthalocyanines (Fig. 3a and b).32,33

The characteristic molecular ion peaks of compounds 3, 6, and 7 were observed at m/z: 394.21 [M + NH4]+, 981.96, [M − C34H51O6 + Na + 2H]+, 1274.91 [M − C15H21O2 − 2H]+, 1509.57 [M]+, 1534.75 [M + Na + 2H]+ and 1292.86 [M-C15H21O3 + 7H]+, 1529.45 [M + 2H]+, respectively, in the mass spectra. These data are positively correlated with the expected figures. It was proved by all of the spectral data (Fig. S1–S12, ESI†) given in the ESI† that compounds 3–7 were successfully synthesized.
3.2. Voltammetric and spectroelectrochemical measurements
The redox properties of MPcs are the key factor for their photoelectrochemical application fields, such as DSSCs, thus here electrochemical characterization of ZnPc(6) and ZnPc(7) is performed with CV, SWV, and CPC measurements. Electrochemical characterization is carried out in DMSO/TBAP electrolytes and then basic electrochemical parameters derived from the voltammograms including half-wave peak potentials (E1/2), peak-to-peak separations (ΔEp), peak current ratio (Ipa/Ipc), HOMO–LUMO energies, and band gaps, are listed in Table 1.

As shown in Fig. 4 and 5, both ZnPc(6) and ZnPc(7) exhibit two reductions and one oxidation redox couple. Due to the different substituent environments, slight differences are observed in the electrochemical parameters, especially for the E1/2 values and reversibility of the couples. While the reduction couples of both complexes are electrochemically reversible concerning ΔEp and Ipa/Ipc values, the oxidation processes of the complexes are observed as quasi-reversible with CV measurements. The SWVs of the complexes well demonstrate the invertability of the corresponding redox couples. As shown in Fig. 4, Oxd(1), Red(1) and Red(2) couples are observed at −0.66, −1.06, and 1.02 V for ZnPc(7) bearing three benzoic acid anchoring groups and a tert-butylphenoxy electron releasing group. When the tert-butylphenoxy electron releasing group was exchanged with a naphthoic acid anchoring group the redox processes slightly shift towards the negative potentials and make the reduction harder, thus Oxd(1), Red(1) and Red(2) couples are observed at −0.68, −1.03, and 1.02 V for ZnPc(6) (Fig. 5). Table 1 indicates that the redox data of ZnPc(6) and ZnPc(7) have consistency with similar ZnPcs existing in the literature. However, because of the redox inactivity of the central Zn2+ cation, the redox responses are completely different from MPcs that have redox active metal centers, like Co2+ and Mn3+. Because of the inactivity of the central metal, all redox processes are assigned to the Pc-based processes, thus HOMO and LUMO levels of the complexes are derived from the Red(1) and Red(2) processes and tabulated in Table 1. Moreover, the peak assignments and energy levels of the orbitals are supported by the in situ spectroelectrochemical (SEC) analyses discussed below. As clearly shown in Table 1, altering the substituents on MPcs causes shifting of the redox processes because of the altering of the electron density of the Pc ring by electron-donating or releasing effects of the substituents. As shown in this table, the redox processes of ZnPc(6) and ZnPc(7) are observed at more positive potentials than for the other ZnPcs because of the higher electron withdrawing features of the substituent environment of these complexes.

It is well reported that the LUMO and HOMO levels of MPcs can be driven by the first Pc-based reductions and oxidation processes. These values of ZnPc(6) and ZnPc(7) are derived from the voltammetric analysis, and the data are tabulated in Table 1. To support the Pc-based character of the electron transfer reactions of the complexes, their peak assignments were also determined with in situ spectroelectrochemical (SEC) analyses. Additionally, SEC characterization is used to identify light absorption behaviors and determine the altering of the light absorption and HOMO and LUMO levels during the electron transfer reactions. Due to the electronic push–pull structures through asymmetrical substitutions ZnPc(6) illustrates characteristic B bands at 338 and 387 nm and the Q band and its shoulder at 679 and 635 nm. These bands were observed at 336, 394, 685, and 636 nm, respectively. Both complexes exhibit sharp and red-shifted Q bands, and the position of the Q band supports their band gaps which are derived from voltammetric measurements. Both complexes exhibit very similar SEC responses, thus in situ UV-Vis changes of ZnPc(6) are shown in Fig. 6 as an example. Neutral ZnPc(6) gives the characteristic B bands at 338 and 387 nm and the Q band at 679 nm, and its shoulder at 635 nm. During the R(1) process, while the Q band intensity diminishes with no shift, a characteristic ligand-to-metal charge transfer (MTLCT) band is detected at 570 nm in Fig. 6a. The spectral transformations are in accordance with the Pc-based processes; thus the R(1) couple is assigned to [Zn2+Pc2−]/[Zn2+Pc3−]1− reduction.13,34–36 The observation of the Q band at the same potential without a shift for the neutral and reduced ZnPc moieties indicates that the photosensitizing activity does not diminish during the electron injection from ZnPcs to the electrodes of the energy harvesting devices. Characteristic Pc-based spectral changes were also observed for the [Zn2+Pc3−]1−/[Zn2+Pc4−]2− reduction for the Red(2) process. Spectral changes during the Oxd(1) process give important information about the formation of hole and hole transfer from ZnPc to the mediator species of the DSSCs, thus SEC analyses are also performed for the Oxd(1) process, and the spectral changes are demonstrated in Fig. 6b. Observation of the Q band without a shift with a decrease in intensity indicates the oxidation of [Zn2+Pc2−] to [Zn2+Pc1−]1+. Decreasing of all bands without observation of isosbestic points may be due to the decomposition of the electrogenerated [Zn2+Pc1−]1+ species under applied potential. These spectral changes show that the HOMO energy level does not alter during the electron transfer reaction in DSSCs.

3.3. Photovoltaic measurements
FTO/TiO2/ZnPc(6) and FTO/TiO2/ZnPc(7) electrodes of DSSCs are prepared by adsorption of the ZnPcs from their DMSO solutions. The amount of the ZnPc(6) and ZnPc(7) loaded on the FTO/TiO2 substrates was determined from the absorbance differences before and after the adsorption processes and determined to be 5.6 × 10−11 mol for ZnPc(6) and 2.2 × 10−11 mol for ZnPc(7) on the 1.0 cm2 surface area of the FTO/TiO2 substrates. The adsorption of ZnPc(6) is 2.5 times higher than that of ZnPc(7), which may be the result of the presence of more anchoring groups on ZnPc(6) than on ZnPc(7). The high amount of the adsorbed ZnPcs on the FTO/TiO2 substrates suggests the formation of dense dye films on the electrodes.37
It is well documented in the literature that for the carboxylic acid anchor, six major types of possible anchoring modes have been identified: a monodentate ester, bidentate chelating, bidentate bridging, monodentate and bidentate H-bonding, as well as monodentate coordinating mode through CO groups. Because of the excellent electron-withdrawing ability of carboxylic acid anchors, these groups are used in most organic D–π–A dyes, in which these anchoring groups typically act as electron acceptors, given their excellent electron-withdrawing capabilities.38,39 In most MPc-based dyes bearing carboxylic acid anchors, the molecule is attached perpendicularly to the TiO2 surface. In the literature, there are different examples of the effect of the number of anchors.40–42 It was observed that because of the strength of the carboxylic anchor, the presence of only one such group is necessary in order to maintain contact with the surface.43 No evidence supporting the assumption that additional anchoring groups provide significantly stronger adsorption was observed, and the overall device performance is likely to be more closely related to the light absorption performance of the dyes which may be manipulated with the number of carboxylic acid groups. The anchoring side most probably influences the amount of the dye loading, so a higher dye loading amount of ZnPc(6) indicates anchoring this molecule from the naphthalene side which has a less bulky environment around the carboxylic acid end.
The performances of the as-prepared DSSCs are determined by using linear sweep voltammetry ((LSV) current–voltage (I–V)) and EIS measurements. The fundamental parameters of the devices including open circuit potential (VOC), FF values, and current density (JSC) are tabulated in Table 2.

Fig. 7 illustrates the photocurrent density (J) vs. voltage (V) responses of DSSCs based on ZnPc(6) and ZnPc(7) under a standard AM 1.5 solar condition. The ZnPc(6) based device shows a higher photovoltaic performance than the ZnPc(6) based device. The FTO/TiO2/ZnPc(6) photoanode device exhibits a Jsc of 9.97 mA cm−2 and a VOC of 760 mV, yielding a power conversion efficiency (η) of 3.89%. These performances for the device bearing ZnPc(7) are 9.77 mA cm−2, 760 mV, and 2.97%, respectively (Table 2). In contrast, the fill factors (FF) were nearly the same for both devices. The high performance of the FTO/TiO2/ZnPc(6) photoanode compared with the FTO/TiO2/ZnPc(7) photoanode points to a linker-dependent injection and/or recombination processes. In ZnPc(6), the presence of one more carboxylic acid is linked with the naphthalene group, which has a higher electron density in the anchoring group and the Pc ring. Moreover, linkers also influence the dye–TiO2 distance and the location of dye on the electrode surface, which influence the electron injection from the dye to the TiO2 due to the different electronic push–pull structures.44,45 The highest IPCE values in the visible region explain the highest JSC, so the IPCE spectra of both devices are in harmony with their absorption properties.46 Maximum IPCE values are observed as 50% for both devices. Also, under AM 1.5G sun irradiation, the integrated photocurrent density for ZnPc(6), ZnPc(7), and N719 is computed as 8.84, 8.53, and 18.23 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 8).

When the photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs bearing FTO/TiO2/ZnPc(6) and FTO/TiO2/ZnPc(7) electrodes are compared with those of similar MPc based devices published, it is clear that the devices studied here are among the ones achieving the highest performance with respect to VOC and η reponses in particular. High VOC values most probably result from the high adsorbed amount of them on the photoanode of the devices. Additionally, ECB and the number of electron injections and charge recombination influence the VOC values. High VOC values also reflect an improvement in the electron injection efficiency from the dye to the TiO2 semiconductor and the reduced charge recombination process.47 Although FTO/TiO2/ZnPc(6) and FTO/TiO2/ZnPc(7) based devices have the highest VOC and η performance, their FF values are generally worse than the reported ones. The lower FF may be due to the shunt resistance of the cell which resulted from the charge recombination between the reduced sensitizer and the photoanodes. Improving the push–pull features of the dyes may improve the negative effect of the dye/electrode recombination and increase the FF.48 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) contributes to a sound understanding of the equivalent circuit of the devices, and their charge transfer resistance (RCT), charge injection, and recombination features.48 The EIS analyses of the FTO/TiO2/ZnPc/electrolyte/Pt/ITO devices are carried out between 0.1 Hz and 100 kHz frequency with 10 mV amplitude under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2 light (Fig. 9). Nyquist plots of both FTO/TiO2/ZnPc(6)/electrolyte/Pt/ITO and FTO/TiO2/ZnPc(7)/electrolyte/Pt/ITO devices illustrate two semicircles corresponding to the charge-transfer resistances at the electrolyte/Pt interface (RPT) at the high-frequency region and the TiO2/ZnPc/electrolyte interface (RCT) at the middle-frequency region respectively (Fig. 9a). RPT is so small thus it is not obvious and overlapped by RCT, representing the interfacial charge-transfer resistance.47 Both devices have the same equivalent circuit as illustrated in Fig. 9b. From the corresponding equivalent circuit, the resistances and electron lifetime were derived and tabulated in Table 3.

TiO2/ZnPc/electrolyte interface (RCT) responses are more related to the efficiency of the devices and this value of ZnPc(6) (436.92 Ω) is lower than that of ZnPc(7) (493.7 Ω) which is in harmony with the higher efficiency of ZnPc(6). The Bode plots indicate the pseudo capacitance features of the devices which deviated from the ideal capacitors (less than 90°). High deviation from the ideal capacitor reflects better electron injection. Thus ZnPc(6) has a high phase angle compared with the commercial N719 dye and low phase angle compared with ZnPc(7) (Fig. 9b). The higher electron lifetime (τe: 0.77 ms) of the exited electrons for the ZnPc(6) is also consistent with its better photovoltaic performance. Overall, the ZnPc(6) device shows lower RCT and longer τe values as compared to ZnPc(6) devices, thus illustrating enhanced charge transfer processes. The percentage of photoinjected electrons that reach the electron collector without recombining with either the oxidized dye or an oxidized component in the redox electrolyte is referred to as the charge-collection efficiency (ηCC).43ηCC is described by the relationship ηCC = [1 + (Rs/RCT1)]−1. The higher charge collection efficiency is a result of a longer electron lifetime.44 So, the charge collection efficiency of the species is in harmony with their electron lifetime (Table 3).
To investigate the charge carrier separation efficiency, the room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the prepared electrodes, FTO/TiO2/ZnPc(6) and FTO/TiO2/ZnPc(7), were obtained (Fig. 10). Both electrodes exhibit two emission bands at the hypsochromic and bathochromic regions, which are attributed to TiO2 and ZnPcs respectively. FTO/TiO2/ZnPc(6) presents a narrow emission band at 700 nm with a small band at 755 nm. These bands shift towards the longer wavelength, and get wider and increase in intensity for the FTO/TiO2/ZnPc(7). These differences in the PL spectra indicate that FTO/TiO2/ZnPc(6) has higher efficient electron–hole separation, long-lived carriers, and lower recombination tendency of the charge carriers with respect to FTO/TiO2/ZnPc(7).49,50 The higher electron lifetime of the FTO/TiO2/ZnPc(6) observed with PL measurements supports the EIS responses of these electrodes.

The stability of the dye, electrolyte, photoanode, and Pt is a major contributor to the overall stability of DSSCs. Thus, using 50 trials of LSV and EIS, we performed stability studies on all DSSCs as shown in Fig. 11 and 12. As shown in these figures, both devices retain the stability of all-photovoltaic performances over 50 cycles.

4. Conclusion
Two novel sensitizer ZnPcs, ZnPc(6) and ZnPc(7), which differ in their anchoring number and one of the linkers of the anchoring group, were prepared and characterized using different optic methods as well as electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical analyses. Both complexes illustrated characteristic B and Q bands with high molar extinction coefficients in the UV-Vis part of the solar spectrum. Well-defined reduction and oxidation processes and the positions of these redox processes indicated the suitability of these complexes as sensitizers in DSSCs. Thus, FTO/TiO2/ZnPc/electrolyte/Pt/ITO devices bearing ZnPc(6) and ZnPc(7) were constructed and tested under 1 sun and AM 1.5 conditions. ZnPc(6) exhibited higher performances than ZnPc(7), due to the difference in the linker and anchoring groups. The FTO/TiO2/ZnPc(6) photoanode device exhibited a Jsc of 9.97 mA cm−2, a VOC of 760 mV, an FF of 41%, and a power conversion efficiency (η) of 3.89%. These performances are among the highest reported performances for ZnPc-based DSSCs. Additionally, EIS responses supported that using a naphthalene linker with one more carboxylic acid group on ZnPc(6) made it a more suitable photosensitizer for DSSCs.
