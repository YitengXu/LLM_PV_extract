    , Accepted 27th November 2015First published on 30th November 2015AbstractSandwich-like nitrogen-doped porous carbon/graphene nanoflakes (NPCFs) are prepared via a two-step approach, firstly by using in situ polymerization of pyrrole (Py) on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) and then by KOH activation under an Ar atmosphere. As the shape-directing agent and conductive matrix, graphene sheets play an important role in enhancing NPCFs’ electrochemical performance. The NPCFs exhibit high specific surface area (2502 m2 g−1), short ion diffusion path (ca. 30 nm), high conductivity (72 S m−1) and a considerable nitrogen level (6.3 wt%). These intriguing features render NPCFs a promising electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitors, which displays high specific capacitance (341 F g−1), excellent rate capability (over 71% retention ratio at 50 A g−1) and outstanding cycling stability (almost no capacitance loss after 2000 cycles) in a 30 wt% KOH aqueous electrolyte. Besides, the assembled symmetrical supercapacitor delivers a high gravimetric energy density of 11.3 Wh kg−1 in an aqueous electrolyte and 66.4 Wh kg−1 in an organic electrolyte.
Introduction
With the rapid development of human society as well as severe environmental issues associated with the use of fossil fuels, the demand for renewable energy has greatly increased, such as wind, solar, nuclear, and geothermal energies. However, these kinds of energies are intermittent, the conversion and storage of electricity produced by these renewable sources thus become much more important.1,2 Supercapacitors have been considered to be one of the most promising energy-storage devices due to their high power density, long cycle life and cost effectiveness.3 Nowadays, various carbon materials are used as electrode materials for supercapacitors owing to their superior physical and chemical properties such as high specific surface area (SSA), tunable pore structure, superior electrical conductivity, chemically inert nature and low cost.4,5 However, two fatal weaknesses, namely, low energy density and fast capacitance deterioration at high current densities, limit their potential application as power sources.6
Increasing the specific surface area of carbon materials is one of the most widely used and effective approaches to enhance the energy density. It is generally accepted that micropores are crucial for electrical double layer capacitance (EDLC), and most microporous carbons possess high specific capacitance at low current densities.7 However, pore paths are always too long in microporous carbon materials, which drastically increases ion-transfer resistance from bulk electrolytes to micropore inner surfaces. The poor ion transportation process consequently limits the power density of supercapacitors, especially at high current densities. For example, zeolite-templated porous carbons, with a SSA of 2750 m2 g−1 and sole microporosity show a capacitance of 127.8 F g−1 in a 2 M H2SO4 electrolyte at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. However, these carbons could only maintain 33.4% of their initial capacitance at a current density of 20 mA cm−2.8 MOF-derived microporous carbons, exhibit a SSA of 1523 m2 g−1 and a high capacitance of 251 F g−1 in a 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Nevertheless, the capacitance decreases to 63% of its initial capacitance at 200 mV s−1.9 Another example is microporous carbon nanospheres, which exhibit a high micropore ratio of 93% and a SSA of up to 2264 m2 g−1. The specific capacitance of this kind of nanosphere reaches up to 190 F g−1 in a 6 M KOH electrolyte at a current density of 0.02 A g−1, but decreases fast to 110 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1.10 All the above-mentioned microporous carbons possess a poor rate performance due to their large particle sizes. Therefore, the design and development of novel microporous carbon materials with high specific surface areas and short pore paths would be significant in reducing the capacitance deterioration and enchancing the rate capability.
Instead of increasing the specific surface areas and shortening the diffusion paths, another effective way for improving electrochemical performances is to modify carbon materials with oxygen,11 nitrogen12,13 or phosphorus14 containing functional groups. These heteroatoms could affect the hydrophilicity and electron distribution of the carbon matrix, thus improving the wettability and enlarging the electro-active areas of electrode materials.15 Specifically, the active nitrogen atoms can also enhance the total capacitance through the pseudocapacitance effect.16,17 Recent research indicates that nitrogen doping of carbon materials seems to be the most promising method for capacitance enhancement while maintaining their superb cycling durability.18 What's more, nitrogen doping can also boost the electronic conductivity of the carbon matrix, in favor of the high power density and rate capability of carbon-based supercapacitors.19
Herein, 2D sandwich-like nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanoflakes (NPCFs) with a graphene layer in between have been fabricated by using graphene oxide as the shape-directing agent. The as-prepared NPCFs with a low pore aspect ratio facilitate ultrafast ion transportation during the charge/discharge process. Besides, the large interior surface and heteroatom-containing functional groups act as “ion adsorption sites” and “faradaic reaction sites”, respectively, which enhance the overall capacitance of NPCFs.
Experimental section
Materials
Natural graphite was purchased from Qingdao Ruisheng Graphite Co., Ltd. Pyrrole was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and stored at 0 °C. Concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl), concentrated sulphuric acid (H2SO4), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), and ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd and used without further purification. Deionized water (DI) was prepared by using a Millipore pure water system.
GO synthesis and purification
GO was prepared by using a modified Hummers method.20 In a typical synthesis, 0.5 g of graphite, 0.5 g of NaNO3, and 23 mL of H2SO4 were firstly mixed together in an ice bath. Then 3 g of KMnO4 was slowly added, and the dispersed suspension was transferred to a 35 °C water bath. After vigorous stirring for about 1 h, 40 mL of water was added, and the solution temperature was raised to 95 °C. Finally, 100 mL of water and 3 mL of H2O2 (30 wt%) was dropped into the solution, turning the colour from dark brown to yellow. The warm solution was then filtered and washed thoroughly with deionized water. The filter cake was then redispersed in water by mechanical agitation. Low-speed centrifugation was performed at 1000 rpm about 3–5 times until all visible particles were removed from the solution. The supernatant then underwent high-speed centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 15 min to remove small GO pieces and water-soluble impurities. Finally, the sediment was redispersed in a certain amount of water by sonication, giving a homogeneous solution of exfoliated GO (1 mg mL−1).
Synthesis of polypyrrole/GO composites
PPy/GO composites (denoted as PG-50) were prepared by in situ polymerization of the pyrrole monomer on the surface of GO. Typically, 1 g of pyrrole was dissolved in 130 mL of water, followed by mixing with 20 mL of GO solution. After sonicating for 30 min, 50 mL of FeCl3·6H2O aqueous solution was added into the above mixture drop by drop, slowly initiating the polymerization process. The molar ratio of the pyrrole monomer to FeCl3·6H2O was 1:2. After reaction at 0 °C for 8 h, the resulting black precipitates were filtered and washed with ethanol and water alternately at least 3 times, then dried at 80 °C overnight. For comparison, pure polypyrrole (PPy) without GO was synthesized by using the same method.
Chemical activation of PG-50
The black powder PG-50 was firstly mixed with KOH pellets in an agate mortar for 5 min at mass ratios of 1:1 and 1:2, respectively. Then the activation process was performed at 700 °C for 2 h with a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1 under an Ar atmosphere. After cooling down to room temperature, the activated composites were washed with HCl (10 wt%) and water to remove the residual inorganic salts until the pH value of the filtrate became neutral, and finally dried at 120 °C for 12 h. The nitrogen-doped porous carbon/graphene nanoflakes were denoted as NPCFs-X (X = 1, 2), where X is the mass ratio of KOH and PG-50. Besides, activated polypyrrole (APPy-2) and reduced graphene oxide was used for comparison. APPy-2 was prepared by activating PPy under conditions the same as NPCFs-2. RGO was prepared by quickly moving GO from room temperature to 700 °C under an Ar atmosphere.
Material characterization
The morphologies of all the samples were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Sirion 200, Netherlands) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2100UHR, Japan). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K by using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 equipment. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was calculated using the adsorption branch data in the relative pressure (P/P0) range from 0.06 to 0.3, and the total pore volume was determined from the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at a relative pressure (P/P0) of 0.99. The pore size distribution (PSD) was calculated by quenched solid state density functional theory (QSDFT) using nitrogen adsorption branch data, employing the slit pore model. Phase analysis was performed on a PANalytical X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation. The graphitic structure was investigated by Raman spectroscopy (RM2000, Renishaw, Gloucestershire, UK). The surface properties of NPCFs were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5000 VersaProbe, ULVAC-PHI, Japan) with an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). Chemical compositions of the samples were determined using an elemental analyser (EA, Vario EL cube, Germany).
Electrochemical measurements
The carbon material was mixed with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, 5 wt%) as a binder at a weight ratio of 95:5, followed by sonication treatment for 20 min and dried at 105 °C for 4 h. Approximately 2 mg of the mixture was put onto nickel foam with an area of 1 cm2 and pressed under the pressure of 10 MPa to fabricate the electrode. In order to guarantee the working electrodes could be well wetted by the electrolyte, the electrodes were vacuum impregnated with 30 wt% KOH solution for evaluating their capacitive behavior in the aqueous electrolyte (30 wt% KOH). The model capacitors with the organic electrolyte were also assembled in a glovebox filled with argon (Mikrouna Universal 2440/750, H2O and O2 < 1 ppmv) by placing two electrodes sandwiched with a fiber separator in a 1 M TEABF4/AN electrolyte. All electrochemical tests, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out on a CHI660D testing station. In a three-electrode system, CV, GCD and EIS were measured using a platinum film as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. CV and GCD tests in a 30 wt% KOH electrolyte were recorded in the potential window of −1–0 V (vs. SCE). A potential window of 0–2.5 V was applied to the electrochemical measurements in the TEABF4/AN electrolyte. The specific gravimetric capacitance in the three-electrode system was calculated from the galvanostatic discharge curves, according to the following equation:21 (1)where I (A) is the current density, Δt (s) is the discharge time, m (g) is the mass of the active material contained in the working electrode, and Δv (V) is the potential window. For the two-electrode system, the total capacitance of a supercapacitor was calculated from the galvanostatic discharge process according to the following equation: (2)where m (g) is the total mass of the active material in both electrode and I (A) is the current density. dv/dt is calculated from the slope of the GCD curve. The specific capacitance of the single electrode is thus calculated by the following equation: Csingle = 4Ctotal(3)
The multiplier of 4 adjusts the capacitance of the cell and the combined mass of two electrodes to the capacitance and the mass of a single electrode. The energy and power density were calculated using eqn (4) and (5), respectively: (4) (5)where Ctotal is the total capacitance of symmetric configuration (F g−1) according to the GCD curves, Δv is the voltage scan range (V) and Δt is the discharge time (s). Coulombic efficiency, η, is calculated using eqn (6) with the same current used for charging and discharging, i.e. (6)where tD and tC are the times spent in discharging and charging, respectively.
Results and discussion
NPCFs were prepared by a simple two-step strategy, as depicted in Fig. 1. Firstly, PPy/GO composites were prepared via an in situ polymerization method, using pyrrole and GO as the monomer and shape-directing agent, respectively.22 Ferric chloride hexahydrate was employed as the initiator. Secondly, the PPy/GO composites were mixed with KOH, followed by heating at 700 °C for 2 h under Ar gas flow.

Fig. 2 shows the morphologies of the as-prepared samples. The PG-50 composites possess a uniform sheet-like structure with a smooth surface, indicating that GO nanosheets are coated homogeneously with PPy (Fig. 2a and b). Compared with the PPy/GO composites, pure PPy tends to form spherical agglomerates because of the absence of GO nanosheets (Fig. S1†). After the activation process, the lamellar structure of PG-50 composites is conserved without obvious framework collapse (Fig. 2c and d). The rough surface of NPCFs-2 is due to KOH corrosion at high temperature. From the high-magnification scanning electron microscopy image (Fig. 2d), the thickness of NPCFs-2 is measured to be about 60 nm. Considering that ions can diffuse into the inner pores from both sides, the ion diffusion path is supposed to be around 30 nm. However, the diffusion path should be longer when considering the tortuosity of pore channels.

In agreement with the above mentioned SEM observations, the TEM image also shows the 2D sheet-like architecture of NPCFs-2 (Fig. 2e). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image further confirms that the sandwich-like structures possess a graphene layer in the center and two microporous carbon layers on both sides (Fig. 2f). The abundant micropores mainly originate from the reaction between KOH and carbonized polypyrrole at high temperature. This unique sandwich-like structure with graphene in the center would be beneficial for rapid transfer of electrons during the charge/discharge process, and substantially enhance the rate capability of NPCFs-2. All in all, the sandwich-like NPCFs-2 sample with 2D structures, massive micropores and short ion diffusion paths is beneficial for rapid ion diffusion and transport.
To investigate the influence of KOH dosage on the microstructure of carbon materials, all the products were characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As depicted in Fig. 3a, two broad diffraction peaks can be observed at around 2θ = 25.0° and 43.1°, which can be assigned to the (002) and (100) planes of graphite, respectively.23 This suggests the existence of partially graphitic structures after the activation process. A sharp increase in the low-angle scatter region indicates the presence of abundant micropores, which is in good agreement with the HRTEM observation (Fig. 2f).24

The Raman test was further conducted to clarify carbon microstructures and the Raman spectra are shown in Fig. 3b. The obtained samples display two broad peaks at 1350 and 1590 cm−1, attributed to characteristic D and G bands, respectively. As previously reported, the G peak is due to the relative motion of the sp2 carbon atoms, while the D peak is linked to the breathing modes of sp2 atoms in the rings, which is directly related to defects or disorder.25 Besides, the relative intensity of the D and G bands (ID/IG) is proportional to the number of defect sites inside. The ID/IG value (as listed in Table 1) for NPCFs-1 and NPCFs-2 is 0.91 and 0.94, respectively. The higher ID/IG value for NPCFs-2 suggests that more KOH dosage would contribute to an increase of defects and disorder due to the formation of more nanopores by KOH activation. However, the ID/IG ratios of both NPCFs-1 and NPCFs-2 are below 0.95, implying that they are partially graphitized.26

The detailed textural characteristics of the obtained carbon materials were demonstrated by nitrogen adsorption–desorption at 77 K. As shown in Fig. 3c and d, the NPCFs-1 sample shows a type I adsorption isotherm, and gets saturated at a relative pressure (P/P0) of ca. 0.23, revealing its microporous nature. However, as the KOH dosage increases to twice the mass of PPy, the isotherm changes to type IV with a significant hysteresis loop, which suggests the formation of mesopores. The BET specific surface area and pore volume of NPCFs-2 is 2502 m2 g−1 and 1.7 m3 g−1, respectively, which is slightly higher than that of APPy-2 (2360 m2 g−1 and 1.3 m3 g−1), and much higher than that of NPCFs-1 (1349 m2 g−1 and 0.9 m3 g−1). The larger pore volume of NPCFs-2 is owing to the higher KOH dosage, which is coincident with the pore size distribution curves (Fig. 3d). Particularly, the as obtained NPCFs-2 possesses the highest BET surface area and the most apparent hierarchical pore size distribution. There is no doubt that the existence of mesopores could facilitate rapid ion transportation during the high rate charge/discharge process. All of the textural data are summarized in Table 2.

Elemental analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and elemental dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were performed to analyze the chemical composition of the samples. From EA results, the N content in NPCFs-2 is 6.3 wt% (as shown in Table 1). The type and relative content of nitrogen species are analyzed by XPS measurement (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4c and d, the high resolution XPS spectra of N 1s could be deconvoluted to four types of nitrogen species: pyridinic (N-6, 398.7 eV), pyrrolic (N-5, 400.3 eV), quaternary (N-Q, 401.4 eV), and pyridine-N-oxide (N-4, 402.8 eV) nitrogen, respectively. Pyridinic-type and pyrrolic-type nitrogen take up more than 90 at% of the total nitrogen content (Table S1†). Hulicova reported that nitrogen located at the edge of graphene layers, i.e. pyridinic-type and pyrrolic-type nitrogen, could induce a pseudocapacitance effect.27 Besides, XPS analysis also presents a high content of oxygen species on the surface of these carbon materials. These oxygen-containing functional groups are mainly introduced during the KOH activation process. EDS mapping (Fig. S2†) shows a homogeneous doping of elemental N and O in the NPCFs-2 sample. Rich nitrogen and oxygen functional groups can not only considerably contribute to additional pseudo-capacitance, but also improve the wettability of carbon materials to aqueous electrolytes.

The supercapacitor performance of the as-prepared samples was first evaluated by a conventional three-electrode system with 30 wt% KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte. Fig. 5a shows the CV curves at different scan rates in the voltage window of −1–0 V. The charge/discharge branches of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) display quasi-rectangular shape, demonstrating that the energy storage mechanism for RGO is the near-ideal electric double layer capacitance. However, the CV curves of those N-doped porous carbon materials within the potential window from −1 to −0.3 V are distorted, which is derived from two reasons: first, the heteroatoms (N, O) on the surface could induce faradaic reactions;16 second, the solvated ions penetrate into ultramicropores under a strong electrostatic force at high voltages.7,28 Moreover, for the NPCFs-2 and NPCFs-1 samples, there is an increase of current density within the potential window of −0.3–0 V during the discharge process in CV curves, which is in accordance with the long discharge duration time in this potential range of GCD curves (Fig. 5c). Previous work attributed this phenomenon to undesirable interactions between solvated ions and heteroatom-containing carbon surfaces.29 The integrated area of NPCFs-2 in CV curves is larger than those of the other samples, suggesting a relatively higher capacitance. Notably, the CV curve of NPCFs-2 retains a distorted rectangular shape at a scan rate as high as 100 mV s−1 (Fig. 5b), indicating that ultramicropores can be utilized even under harsh conditions. This confirms that the unique 2D sandwich-like structure of NPCFs could facilitate quick charge-propagation capability and high rate performance.

GCD tests were carried out at different current densities in the voltage window of −1–0 V (vs. SCE) to further evaluate the electrochemical behaviors of the as-prepared carbon materials. As shown in Fig. 5c, all the GCD curves are nearly linear and the discharge curves are generally symmetrical to their charging counterparts without an obvious voltage drop at the starting point, demonstrating their excellent reversibility and small internal resistance. The coulombic efficiencies, η, (discharge capacitance/charge capacitance) are higher than 94%. NPCFs-2 shows the longest discharging time and thus possesses the highest specific capacitance, which is in agreement with the results obtained from CV experiments. The specific capacitance of NPCFs-2 is 341 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, 298 F g−1 at 5 A g−1and still maintains 244 F g−1 at 50 A g−1 with a capacitance retention ratio of 71% (Fig. 5d). In addition, as calculated by CV curves, NPCFs-2 also exhibits a very high capacitance retention ratio of 61% as the scan rate increases from 5 to 500 mV s−1 (Fig. S3†). The excellent rate performance of NPCFs-2 is attributed to its preponderant 2D porous structure, i.e., high aspect ratio, short diffusion channels, hierarchical pore size distribution and intermediate graphene layers serving as conductive frameworks. Besides, the heteroatom-containing functional groups can enhance the wettability of carbon surfaces, thus improving the accessiblity of electrolyte ions.
The Nyquist plots for NPCFs-2 electrode and other samples are shown in Fig. 6a. In the high-frequency region, the Nyquist plot shows a semicircle shape and the real axis intercept represents the equivalent series resistance (ESR). The ESR of NPCFs-1 and NPCFs-2 is 0.74 and 0.59 Ω, respectively. The high-frequency semicircle is generally interpreted as the charge transfer resistance of faradaic reaction. As shown in Fig. 6a and the inset, NPCFs-2 has a smaller semicircle radius when compared with that of NPCFs-1 and APPy-2, which originates from its lowest heteroatom content. The transition region between the high-frequency semicircle and the vertical line region shows a diagonal line with a slope of 45°, indicating typical Warburg impedance. This result reflects that the NPCFs have a porous structure as confirmed by TEM, XRD and BET results. In the low frequency region, the plot manifests itself by a line that intersects with the real axis at a near 90° angle, which is consistent with ideal EDLC behavior.

The inset shows the GCD curves from 2000 to 3000 s and from 9000 to 10000 s; (c) specific capacitance measured in a two-electrode system at various current densities from 0.1 to 50 A g−1; (d) Ragone plot showing the position of NPCFs-2 relative to those of 3D-GR,30 GMCS,31 ACNO-6M,32 HPGC,33 MCFs,34 NG,35 OMC,36 RGO-CMK-5,37 and PANI GNRs-20.38 The dashed lines symbolize the current drain time. 
Cycle life is another important property for practical application of supercapacitor electrode materials. The cycling stability of NPCFs-2 was evaluated by repeating the GCD test for 10000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 6b, NPCFs-2 exhibits outstanding electrochemical stability and superb reversibility in constant current charge–discharge cycles.
For better evaluating the capacitive performance in the aqueous electrolyte, the specific capacitance of the carbons was also measured using the GCD method in a two-electrode symmetrical supercapacitor. Fig. 6c shows the specific capacitance of all the samples at different current densities. The specific capacitance values for NPCFs-2 based on symmetrical supercapacitors are 335 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, 220 F g−1 at 30 A g−1 and 188 F g−1 at 50 A g−1, which is superior to other carbon materials reported recently (Table S2†). The Ragone plot (Fig. S4†) shows that the energy density of NPCFs-2 is much higher than those of pure APPy-2, NPCFs-1, and RGO at all power densities. Moreover, NPCFs-2 was compared with other recently reported representative carbon materials.30–38 As shown in Fig. 6d, in the current drain time of 36–1.8 s, NPCFs-2 manifests superiority to other carbon materials in the aqueous electrolyte at the same current drain time.
In order to further clarify the superior capacitive performance of NPCFs-2, a two-electrode cell was constructed using 1 M TEABF4/AN as the organic electrolyte and its performance is shown in Fig. 7. The CV tests show rectangular curves from 0 to 2.5 V over a wide range of voltage scan rates (Fig. 7a). Even at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, the CV curve remains rectangular, indicating good charge propagation within the NPCFs-2 electrode. The symmetrical triangles of the charge/discharge plots with small IR drops even at a high current density of 5 A g−1 indicate small ESR and high coulombic efficiency (Fig. 7b). The specific capacitances calculated from the discharge curve at various current densities are plotted in Fig. 7c. The specific capacitance of NPCFs-2 is 306 F g−1 at the current density of 50 mA g−1, 286 F g−1 at 500 mA g−1 and still maintains 188 F g−1 at 5 A g−1 (Fig. 7c). This high rate capability could also be ascribed to the 2D porous structure of NPCFs-2, providing a short diffusion path for electrolyte ions.

The Ragone plot in Fig. 7d compares the NPCFs-2 sample with other carbon materials in the organic electrolyte system reported recently.39–45 The highest energy density of 66.4 Wh kg−1 is achieved in the 1 M TEABF4/AN electrolyte at a low power density of 156 W kg−1. The energy density is still as high as 36.4 Wh kg−1 at a high power density of 31 kW kg−1. In the current drain time of 1080–3.6 s, the energy density of NPCFs-2 is superior to the other reported carbons in the organic electrolyte, confirming that the NPCFs-2 sample would be an excellent electrode material for high performance supercapacitors.
The outstanding supercapacitive performance of NPCFs-2 could be ascribed to the following reasons: (1) the micropores within the carbon layers, together with partial mesopores, can provide numerous active sites to accommodate mounts of electrolyte ions, which could contribute to a large specific EDLC; (2) the conductive graphene sheets within the 2D nanoflakes enhance the conductivity notably, serving as ultrafast pathways for electron transportation; (3) ultrathin carbon layers on both sides of graphene reduce ionic diffusion resistance, thus improving the fast charge/discharge rate capability; (4) the introduction of nitrogen heteroatoms can not only improve the surface permeability but also generate additional pseudocapacitance, which also contributes to the overall capacitive performance.
Conclusions
In summary, sandwich-like nitrogen-doped porous carbon/graphene nanoflakes were rationally designed and synthesized by using in situ polymerization of pyrrole on the surface of GO followed by KOH activation. The high specific surface area, short ion diffusion path and high conductivity make NPCFs-2 exhibit enhanced supercapacitive performance, such as high specific capacitance, outstanding rate capability, and excellent cycling stability. Besides, this kind of NPCF can also be a promising electrode material in Li-ion or Na-ion batteries, a catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and a component for other clean energy storage devices.
