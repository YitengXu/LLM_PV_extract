1. Introduction
Solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have been receiving a great deal of attention in recent years due to their lightweight, low cost, and large-area flexible fabrication.1–6 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-junction polymer-based BHJ solar cells have exceeded 9.0%.7–12 However, the purification of polymers is one of the most difficult problems. The impurity and relative polydispersity of molecular weight would significantly affect the performance of the resulting photovoltaic devices.13–15 Compared with polydisperse polymers, solution-processed small molecules for BHJ solar cells have attracted much attention due to their definite molecular structures, accurate molecular weights, and simple purification processes.16–19 The PCEs of small molecule based BHJ solar cells are beyond 8.0%.20–22 However, small molecule based BHJ solar cells showed a lower overall performance than their polymer counterparts.23,24 Thus, it is necessary to design more small-molecule donors to obtain high PCEs.25,26
Triphenylamine (TPA) is regarded as a promising unit for hole-transporting and light-emitting material and efficient photovoltaic material due to its good electron donating and superior hole-transporting capabilities. Three-dimensional star-shaped TPA-based molecules with a single TPA unit as the core have received extensive attention and exhibited high performances.27–29 In our previous work, we have reported a four-armed TPA-based molecule [Th4(DTPAB)] with a linear conjugated molecule [TPA–benzothiadiazole (Bz)–TPA] containing two TPA units as the core and 4-hexylthiophene as the arm and its application in BHJ OSCs.30 The absorption spectrum of Th4(DTPAB) is extended to lower energy regions compared with that of a star-shaped TPA molecule containing a similar arm structure due to its intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in the TPA–Bz–TPA structure core. Moreover, Th4(DTPAB) has good miscibility with commercial [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) to achieve optimum morphology in the active layer of BHJ OSCs, which is corroborated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) measurements.30 To further study the relationship between the structure and properties of four-armed TPA molecules, herein we reported two wide band gap four-armed TPA-based small molecules (SM1 and SM2) with the TPA–thiazolothiazole (TTz)–TPA core instead of the TPA–Bz–TPA core. TTz is a widely used electron-accepting heterocycle due to the electron-withdrawing nitrogen of imine (CN). TTz has a rigid and coplanar fused ring and thereby ensures a highly extended π-electron system and strong π stacking. A wide band gap is favorable for obtaining deep HOMO levels to yield high open voltage (Voc), because Voc is correlated with the difference of the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor.31 In addition, these wide band gap small molecule donors have potential for use in preparing tandem solar cells. The thermal, photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the molecules are studied. The small molecule SM2 with the extended arm structures has better miscibility with commercial PCBM and stronger absorption intensity compared with the molecule SM1. The OSCs based on these small molecule donors have high Voc.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and measurements
All reagents and chemicals were purchased from a chemical supplier (Aldrich, Alfa) and used without further purification except that toluene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were dried and purified by fractional distillation over sodium/benzophenone and handled in a moisture-free atmosphere. 4,4′-(Thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-2,5-diyl)bis(N,N-diphenylaniline) (1) and 4-(3-dodecyl-5-(tributylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)-N,N-diphenylaniline were prepared following published procedures.32,33

1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian Inova 400 (Varian, USA) system with TMS as the internal standard at 298 K. The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra were recorded using an Autoflex III Smartbean (Bruker, Germany). UV-visible absorption spectra were obtained on a UV-2550 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Co., Japan) at room temperature. PL spectra were obtained using an F-2500 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted using a CHI610D electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instrument Co., China) in a tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP, 0.1 mol L−1)/acetonitrile electrolyte at room temperature at the scan rate of 50 mV s−1. A Pt electrode, a platinum wire, and a standard calomel electrode (SCE) were respectively used as the working electrode, the counter electrode, and the reference electrode. Thermogravimetric (TG) curves were recorded in air on a Netzschsta 409P (NETZSCH-Gerätebau GmbH, Germany). Topographic images of the films were obtained on a Bioscope Catalyst Nanoscope-V atomic force microscope (AFM) (Veeco instruments, USA) in the scan mode with an aluminium reflex coating silicon cantilever at the force constant of ∼5 N m−1, and the scanning rate for the image size (5 μm × 5 μm) was 1.0 Hz. A JSM 7001F scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the surface morphology of the small molecule–PC71BM blend film. The wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) analyses were performed using an X'pert powder diffractometer in the reflection mode. Cu-Kα radiation was used at 20 kV and 40 mA. The analyses were performed at angles of 5° to 45° and the scan step was 0.052 (in 2θ) with a counting time of 20 s per step.
2.2. Fabrication and characterization of photovoltaic devices
The OSCs were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/small molecule:PC71BM/LiF (0.6 nm)/Al (100 nm). The ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by sonication in a neutral detergent, distilled water, acetone and 2-propanol. Subsequently, PEDOT:PSS (40 nm) was spin-coated on a cleaned ITO substrate and heated at 120 °C for 15 min under vacuum before the active layer was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. A predissolved composite solution in chloroform was filtered through a syringe filter and spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO substrate to form the active layer. Finally, the counter electrode, consisting of LiF (0.6 nm) and Al (100 nm), was deposited onto the active layer under a pressure of less than 4 × 10−4 Pa by vacuum evaporation and the active area of the solar cells was 4.5 mm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were determined through illuminating the cells using simulated solar light (AM 1.5G) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (solar simulator Model ss-50A, Photo Emission Tech., Camarillo, California). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using an IQE-200 test system (Oriel Co., USA) with the solar cells illuminated with chopped monochromatic light through the ITO side.

1 (314 mg, 0.5 mmol) was dissolved in 30 mL chloroform. Subsequently, N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) (374 mg, 2.1 mmol) in 30 mL chloroform was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 4 h, and poured into water. The organic layer was extracted with chloroform, collected, washed with brine and then dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate to remove the solvent under reduced pressure. The residue was recrystallized in ethanol to give compound 2, a yellow solid (354 mg, 75%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, ppm): 7.81–7.79 (m, 4H), 7.38–7.36 (m, 4H), 7.28–7.31 (m, 4H), 7.11–7.13 (m, 4H), 7.05–7.07 (m, 4H), 6.99–7.01 (m, 4H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz, ppm): 168.2, 150.2, 149.5, 146.4, 146.0, 132.5, 129.7 127.6, 127.4, 125.4, 124.4, 122.3, 116.3.

2.3.2. Synthesis of four-armed TPA-based molecule SM1. 
Under a N2 atmosphere, compound 2 (236 mg, 0.25 mmol), tributyl(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)stannane (914 mg, 2 mmol), Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (18 mg, 0.026 mmol), and well-dried THF (25 mL) were added into a 50 mL three-necked flask. The mixture was refluxed for 12 h, then cooled to room temperature, poured into water, and extracted with CH2Cl2. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine and then dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was removed through vacuum distillation and the residue was purified by column chromatography [silica gel, petroleum ether/CH2Cl2 (3:1)] to produce a yellow solid product SM1 (210 mg, 64%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, ppm): 7.87–7.86 (m, 4H), 7.56–7.54 (m, 4H), 7.44–7.42 (m, 6H), 7.23–7.02 (m, 10H), 2.65–2.62 (t, 8H), 1.60–1.58 (m, 8H), 1.36–1.28 (m, 24H), 0.88–0.86 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz, ppm): 150.5, 145.7, 144.4, 143.2, 132.6, 127.5, 126.9, 126.5, 126.3, 124.3, 122.7, 119.3, 116.9, 32.8, 31.7, 30.4, 29.7, 29.3, 27.1, 25.2, 24.5, 22.7, 21.4, 21.1, 20.6, 20.1, 19.7, 14.1.

2.3.3. Synthesis of four-armed TPA-based molecule SM2. 
According to the similar synthesis method of SM1, 4-(3-dodecyl-5-(tributylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)-N,N-diphenylaniline (1.96 g, 2.5 mmol), instead of tributyl(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)stannane (914 mg, 2 mmol), affords the title product as a yellow solid (310 mg, 48%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, ppm): 7.84–7.82 (m, 4H), 7.52–7.50 (m, 10H), 7.40–7.38 (m, 4H), 7.24–7.31 (m, 21H), 7.02–7.14 (m, 45H), 6.83 (s, 4H), 2.65–2.57 (t, 8H), 1.63 (s, 8H), 1.31–1.23 (m, 72H), 0.88–0.84 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz, ppm): 150.2, 146.9, 144.5, 139.2, 132.5, 129.7, 129.3, 125.2, 124.6, 123.0, 122.6, 31.9, 31.7, 31.0, 30.6, 30.4, 29.7, 29.6, 29.5, 29.3, 29.0, 22.7, 22.6, 14.1.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and thermal properties
The synthetic routes of these small molecules are shown in Scheme 1. SM1 and SM2 were synthesized by Stille coupling reaction with moderate yields. Both of the resulting small molecules showed good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, toluene, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene. The thermal stability of the resulting molecules was investigated by TG analysis. The decomposition temperatures of 5% weight loss were around 376 °C and 344 °C for SM1 and SM2 respectively in an air atmosphere (Fig. 1). Apparently, both molecules have good thermal stability, which was appropriate for applications in optoelectronic devices.

3.2. Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of SM1 and SM2 in dilute chloroform solution (concentration: 1 × 10−5 mol L−1, non-normalized), a neat donor film and small molecule/PC71BM (1:3, w/w) blend film (normalized) are shown in Fig. 2a and b respectively. As shown in Fig. 2a, both molecules show three absorption bands in the range of 300–500 nm in the solution. The first and second absorption bands at the shorter wavelength are attributed to the localized aromatic π–π* transition. The stronger absorption of SM2 in these absorption bands is attributed to its increasing TPA units. The third strong absorption band with the absorption maxima (λmax) at 430 and 439 nm for SM1 and SM2 is attributed to the ICT from the electron-donating TPA units to the electron-deficient TTz unit. According to Beer's Law equation, molar extinction coefficients (ε) at λmax of SM1 and SM2 are calculated to be 5.39 × 104 mol L−1 cm−1 and 8.59 × 104 mol L−1 cm−1, respectively. Besides, the absorption spectra of these molecules in the thin film are slightly red-shifted compared to those in chloroform solution, which indicates the existence of aggregation or π–π* stacking in the film. The less red-shifted absorption of SM2 might be attributed to the additional anchoring nonplanar TPA unit, which impedes intermolecular packing in the solid film compared to that of SM1 (Fig. 2b). The optical band gaps (Eoptg) are obtained from the absorption onsets in their thin films. The Eoptg are calculated to be 2.40 eV and 2.43 eV for SM1 and SM2, respectively (Table 1). The absorption spectra of the blend films show two absorption bands (Fig. 2b). The first absorption band shows an intense band at ca. 378 nm due to the absorption of PC71BM and the second absorption band of these small molecules, and the second broad band at 466 nm is due to the ICT in small molecules and the optical contribution of PC71BM. SM2/PC71BM blend film (1:3, w/w) has stronger absorption than SM1/PC71BM blend film (1:3, w/w) (Fig. S1, ESI†).

The PL spectra of the small molecules and small molecule/PC71BM (1:3, w/w) blend film spin-coated from chloroform solution under 380 nm excitation are shown in Fig. 3. Both SM1 and SM2 molecules emit blue-green light with maximum peaks at 501 nm and 516 nm, respectively. The PL emission of SM2 is red-shifted about 15 nm than that of SM1 because the extended arm structure can enhance the π-system. For the blend films, there is no luminescence detectable, which indicates complete exciton dissociation at the small molecule–PC71BM bulk interface.

To further investigate the electronic properties of the resulting molecules, the electrochemical behaviors are studied through CV measurements to estimate their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. The onset of the oxidation wave (Eox) is 0.83 V (vs. SCE) for SM1 and 0.78 V (vs. SCE) for SM2, respectively. According to the empirical formula [EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.4) (eV)],34 the HOMO energy levels of SM1 and SM2 are estimated to be −5.23 and −5.18 eV. The HOMOs are analogous to those of T0–T2 with thiazolothiazole as the acceptor unit, TPA as the donor unit and thiophene with a different number as the bridge (−5.31 eV, −5.30 eV and −5.28 eV respectively),35 which is beneficial for obtaining high Voc. Meanwhile, from the HOMO energy levels and Eoptg using the equation ELUMO = EHOMO − Eoptg, the LUMO energy levels of the small molecules are estimated to be −2.83 and −2.75 eV, respectively. The data are summarized in Table 1.
3.3. Quantum chemistry calculations
To further study the electronic structure of these molecules, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations for SM1 and SM2 were performed by using the Gaussian 09 program suite at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. The resultant HOMOs and LUMOs were extracted from visualized Multiwfn software.36,37 In the calculations, the alkyl chains of SM2 were replaced by methyl groups to simplify the calculations. The resultant HOMOs and LUMOs were shown in Fig. 4. The HOMO of SM1 is evenly distributed on the central block (TPA–TTz–TPA) and the arm units (thiophene rings). In comparison with SM1, the HOMO of SM2 merely stretched to the phenyl rings on the adjacent thiophene rings, due to the non-planar property of the additional anchoring TPA unit. Furthermore, the electron density of the LUMO of SM1 and SM2 was located on the TTz unit. On the whole, the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of these small molecules indicated an effective ICT transition within the D–A–D core. The TPA terminals have little effect on the electronic structure, but might significantly affect the compatibility of this molecule with PCBM due to its non-planar property.

3.4. Photovoltaic properties
The synthesized small molecules have been used as donors for the solution-processed fabrication of OSCs as the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/small molecule:PC71BM/LiF (0.6 nm)/Al (100 nm). The active layers were spin coated from different solvents (o-dichlorobenzene and chloroform) using different weight ratio blends of small molecule donor:PC71BM, respectively. And we found that chloroform is better than o-dichlorobenzene. Fig. 5 shows the J–V curves of the photovoltaic cells fabricated using small molecule:PC71BM at the optimized ratio from chloroform solution under AM 1.5G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Table 2 and Table S1 (ESI†) summarize the photovoltaic characteristics as a function of PC71BM weight ratios. The optimized donor/acceptor weight ratio for SM1/PC71BM and SM2/PC71BM is 1:3. At the optimized donor/acceptor weight ratio, the OSCs employing the SM2 as the donor exhibit a PCE of 2.10% with a Jsc of 6.80 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.86 V and a FF of 0.36, which is higher than the OSCs prepared with the SM1 donor with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 6.28 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.32, resulting in a PCE of 1.64%. The rather higher Jsc, Voc and FF of SM2 can be attributed to better compatibility with PC71BM and stronger absorption compared to the SM1 molecule. In all cases, FF is relatively low; may be the relatively poor film-forming property of small molecules leads to discontinuous paths for hole transport, which is common for the amorphous small molecule donors.32,38 The poor overall device performances mainly resulted from the low Jsc and FF. To further study the device performances of these small molecule donors, small molecule based OSCs after annealing at 120 °C for 10 min were prepared. Unfortunately, the PCEs based on small molecule:PC71BM (1:3, w/w) are reduced after annealing at 120 °C for 10 min (Table 2 and Table S1, ESI†), which may be due to the poor miscibility of SM1 or SM2 with PC71BM after annealing (Fig. S2, ESI†). Other materials synthesized with similar structures have similar rules after annealing (unpublished data). This may be the characteristic of such materials.

The EQE spectra of the OSCs fabricated with small molecule:PC71BM (1:3, w/w) are shown in Fig. 6. Two blends show the broad photoresponses within the range from 300 nm to 600 nm. The maximum value for SM1:PC71BM and SM2:PC71BM devices was 55.7% at 461 nm and 58.6% at 465 nm. It is believed that the higher molar absorption coefficient and the broader absorption are responsible for the better EQE spectra of SM2.

The thin film morphology of the photoactive layers of solar cell devices is a decisive factor in the performance of OSCs. The AFM and SEM analyses have been done to investigate the morphological properties of the blend SM1:PC71BM (1:3, w/w) and SM2:PC71BM (1:3, w/w) films spin-coated from chloroform solution. In the AFM scanning mode height images (Fig. 7), the RMS values of SM2:PC71BM film and SM1:PC71BM film are respectively 0.40 nm and 1.01 nm, which indicates that SM2:PC71BM blend film is more homogenous and smooth than SM1:PC71BM blend film. From the SEM images (Fig. S2, ESI†), we can see that SM2:PC71BM blend film has finer phase distribution than SM1:PC71BM blend film. The crystallinity of blend films and PC71BM is tested by using XRD (Fig. S3, ESI†). Both blends are partially crystalline. 2θ of the diffraction peak for the blend is consistent with that of PC71BM and there are no diffraction peaks for SM1 or SM2, which indicates that the crystallization is attributed to PC71BM, and SM1 and SM2 are amorphous. The results above indicate better blending or miscibility of SM2 with PC71BM. In general, better miscibility means finer D:A phase separation leading to higher exciton dissociation efficiency.39 Therefore, the Jsc of SM2 based OSCs is higher than that of SM1 based OSCs because the Jsc correlates to the product of exciton dissociation and charge transport.

4. Conclusions
Two wide band gap four-armed TPA-based molecules have been designed and synthesized. To investigate the photovoltaic properties of these two molecules, organic solar cells with the resulting molecules as the electron donors and PC71BM as the electron acceptor are fabricated. The best power conversion efficiencies of 1.64% and 2.10% were achieved for the photovoltaic devices with SM1 and SM2 as donors, respectively, without annealing or other solvent additives. The enhanced Jsc, Voc and FF are mainly attributed to the homogeneous blending of SM2 with PC71BM, which displays the uniform thin film morphology in the fabricated devices. The PCEs based on small molecules:PC71BM (1:3, w/w) are reduced after annealing. This property may be the characteristic of such materials. Moreover, by adjusting the structure of the materials, it is possible to obtain donor materials with good device performances without annealing and solvent additives. This work is in progress.
