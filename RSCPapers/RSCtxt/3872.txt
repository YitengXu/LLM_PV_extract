    , Accepted 28th July 2018First published on 31st July 2018AbstractIn this work, we demonstrate the first successful multiple blend polymer solar cells (PSCs) via a multiple cascade energy level alignment strategy which also have more efficient energy transfer pathways. Based on a pristine poly{4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-4,6-diyl} (PTB7) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) binary blend, a series of two-dimensional (2D) conjugated benzodithiophene-thiophene copolymers (PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT) were used as additional polymeric additives to finely tune the energy levels, absorption, crystallinity, carrier mobility and morphology of the studied active layer in PSCs. These ternary blends provided more charge and energy transfer channels for improving the photon harvesting, exciton dissociation and carrier transport, giving rise to improved device performances. After adding 10 wt% of these polymeric additives, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 8.96%, 9.35% and 9.18% were achieved for PBDTT-TABT-, PBDTT-TANT- and PBDTT-TSNT-based ternary devices, respectively. By introducing a greater number of different bandgap copolymers with similar molecular backbones, steadier energy level alignment and more charge transfer channels were formed in the devices, without destroying the compatibility and morphology of the active layer, and this could promote further charge transfer more smoothly than the respective binary and ternary PSCs. When 4 wt% PBDTT-TANT, 4 wt% PBDTT-TSNT and 2 wt% PBDTT-TABT were added into the pristine PTB7:PC71BM blend, the multiple blend PSCs exhibited the highest PCE of 10.40%, which is the best value for PTB7-based PSCs reported so far. Our work demonstrates a facile design strategy via multiple blend engineering to increase open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) simultaneously to achieve high-performance PSCs.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure, composed of both a conjugated semiconductor and a fullerene derivative, have spotlighted the future of renewable energy conversion due to their attractive properties of low cost, light weight, mechanical flexibility, and roll-to-roll printing technique for the fabrication of large-area devices.1–4 In the past decade, enormous efforts have been devoted to integrating innovations in both delicate material design and diverse device engineering to elevate the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.5–10 However, the ultimate device efficiency is limited by the two factors of insufficient light absorption and low carrier mobility.11,12 Therefore, it is still a challenge to break through the critical point for the commercial application of PSCs.
In order to resolve the above problems of binary PSCs, tandem solar cells have been put forward, with stacks of two or more sub-cells in parallel or series with different bandgap conjugated polymer donors.5,6,13–17 Although a PCE of over 14% has been achieved with tandem cells, 19 tandem solar cells were involved in an intricate device design and fabrication, which limited their practical utilization. Recently, ternary blend PSCs have attracted considerable attention.11,18–32 As an alternative and effective strategy, ternary blend cells are expected to improve the PCEs of binary BHJ devices, while retaining their simple device fabrication technology.18–32 Generally, ternary blends contain two donors with one acceptor (D1:D2:A) or one donor with two acceptors (D:A1:A2), which would generate the complementary absorption spectrum and optimized morphology compared with their binary blends.18–32 As a result, the elevated device performance would complement the improved short circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) by adding a third component. For the most studied double donor cases, the additional donor materials commonly include more red-absorbing small-molecule sensitizers,21,33,34 polymer sensitizers,18,20 or quantum dot sensitizers.35,36 However, the third components with a red-shifted absorption in such ternary blend PSCs usually have a smaller bandgap and an inherently shallower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level relative to the parent donor material. Because the open circuit voltage (Voc) of ternary blend devices is fixed by the higher-lying HOMO level of the donor material,37–40 the additional red-absorbing donor will limit the further elevation of the Voc and PCE values in this type of ternary PSC. In order to avoid the above limitation of Voc, we recently studied ternary blend PSCs by incorporating a third component donor with a larger bandgap and lower-lying HOMO level, which complement the absorption of the host polymer donor within the shorter wavelength region and increase the Voc of their binary devices.11 Sun et al. also reported similar results for ternary PSCs by adding another type of additional high-performance copolymer with a large bandgap of 1.93 eV.23 Although the concept of ternary blend PSCs exhibited superior features over the respective binary blend devices by complementing the absorption, fine-tuning the energy levels, improving the crystallinity, and optimizing the morphology of the active blends, the ternary system would also provide more energy and charge transfer channels in solar cell devices, which could contribute further photon application and promote smoother hole/electron transfer to elevate the Jsc, FF and PCE values of the corresponding PSCs.18–40 Therefore, it is appealing to develop highly efficient PSCs via a multiple blend strategy. Yang et al. reported the first multiple donor PSCs, but the device performance was not satisfactory (the PCE was lower than those of their ternary blend devices).39 Recently, we demonstrated the first successful quaternary blend PSCs with a high efficiency of 10.2% by incorporating two polymer donors and two fullerene acceptors at the same time.11 This encouraged us to develop more efficient PSCs using a multiple cascade energy level strategy.
In this work, we report the first successful multiple donor PSCs with a PCE of 10.40% by careful selection of a series of high-performance copolymer donors (Fig. 1a). Poly{4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-4,6-diyl}(PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) is chosen here as the parent binary blend, because this active blend system is the most efficient and widely studied candidate so far for PSCs.41,42 A series of the two-dimensional (2D) benzodithiophene-thiophene copolymers, PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT, were selected as the additional polymer donors because these copolymers had Voc values as high as ca. 1.0 V.43 This was expected to elevate the Voc of the respective multiple blend PSCs based on the parent PTB7:PC71BM blend. In addition, the inherent crystallinity and the 2D molecular structure of the additional copolymers43 would also finely tune the compatibility, morphology and carrier mobility of the corresponding active multiple-blends to achieve satisfactory Jsc and FF, by carefully adjusting the different types and blend ratios of the polymer donors used. What is more, the improved charge and energy transfer channels enabled by the multiple blend system could effectively reduce the charge recombination with a higher photocurrent output. When 2 wt% PBDTT-TABT, 4 wt% PBDTT-TANT and 4 wt% PBDTT-TSNT were added into the PTB7:PC71BM host blend, the fabricated multiple blend devices showed a high PCE of 10.40%, which is the best efficiency for PTB7-based single-junction fullerene PSCs reported so far.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Basic properties of the studied copolymers
The absorption and energy level are the important factors that should be taken into consideration to select appropriate donors and acceptors in multiple blend PSCs. Fig. 1b shows the absorption curves of the studied copolymer donors and PTB7. It can clearly be seen that these copolymers dominate two mainly distinct regions in the shorter wavelength region relative to that of PTB7. PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT exhibit strong absorption below 600 nm due to their large bandgaps, while PTB7 shows an absorption in the range of 550–720 nm with a relatively low bandgap. Therefore, a complementary absorption was achieved to match solar light by a combination of the above large bandgap copolymers and PTB7, which should be beneficial for charge generation inside the designed multiple blend devices. The energy level alignments of the components considered are also presented in Fig. 1c. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PTB7 and PC71BM were −5.19/−5.38 eV and −6.0/−4.0 eV, respectively. The relatively large difference in HOMO levels between PTB7 and PC71BM would hinder effective hole transport.40 The HOMO and LUMO levels of PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT were measured in our previous work to be −5.45/−3.31 eV, −5.37/−3.39 eV and −5.41/−3.44 eV, respectively.43 For PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT, energy levels are positioned between those of PTB7 and PC71BM, which would form the expected cascade energy levels, and thus facilitate charge transport at the D/A interface.40,44 However, PBDTT-TABT exhibits a HOMO level between those of PTB7 and PC71BM but a higher LUMO level than either PTB7 or PC71BM, which would prevent efficient charge transfer in a ternary system.22,23
2.2 Photovoltaic performances of the ternary blend PSCs
Ternary blend PSCs were first fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PBDTT-TABT or PBDTT-TANT or PBDTT-TSNT:PC71BM/Ca/Al to investigate the effect of the additional amount of the third component on the performance of PTB7:PC71BM-based devices. The overall ratio of polymer donor to PC71BM was maintained at 1:1.5 (w/w). The weight percentages of the different polymeric additives relative to the total polymer donors were varied from 0% to 100%. The thicknesses of the optimal active layers were around 100–110 nm. To clarify the effect of the polymeric additive, a control binary device based on parent PTB7:PC71BM was also fabricated and evaluated under the same conditions. Under each condition, at least twenty devices were fabricated to calculate the average PCE values. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the device performances could be increased at first by increasing the content of the polymer additives up to 10%, but they then decreased when the polymer additives were increased to more than 10%. However, almost linear increases in Voc were observed with a continuous increase in the polymer additives, due to their lower-lying HOMO levels. These phenomena had also been observed previously in an alloy model.45,46 In this work, alloy states could be formed between PTB7 and the polymer additives. Therefore, the mixed new quasi frontier orbitals density of the alloy states depended strongly on the additional amount of polymer additive, leading to a monotonically increased variation in the Voc of the devices.45,46
We further optimized the ternary devices within a 20% addition of the polymer additives (Fig. S2–S4, ESI†). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimal devices are shown in Fig. 2a. The related photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 1 and Table S1 (ESI†). The variation profiles with different amounts of polymer additives are presented in Fig. 3. The binary PTB7:PC71BM device exhibited a Voc of 0.72 V, a Jsc of 16.44 mA cm−2, and an FF of 65.5%, yielding a PCE of 7.76%, values which are comparable with those in the previously reported literature.39,47 Significant improvements in the above photovoltaic parameters were obtained by adding a certain content of polymeric additives relative to that of the control binary device. In order to make a clearer comparison, the differences in Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE values, depending on addition percentages, are presented in Fig. 3. The ternary devices exhibit different improvements in Voc when 5 wt% PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT or PBDTT-TSNT were added, which were 0.765 V for the PTB7:PBDTT-TABT:PC71BM device, 0.750 V for the PTB7:PBDTT-TANT:PC71BM device, and 0.735 V for the PTB7:PBDTT-TSNT:PC71BM device. Because these copolymers possess different HOMO levels (Fig. 1c), they exhibited different Voc values for their binary PSCs in our previous work.43 Among the above three additional copolymers, PBDTT-TABT has the lowest-lying HOMO level, which gives rise to the largest elevation in Voc in the corresponding ternary PSCs (Fig. 3a).18,19 Apart from the Voc tuning, the Jsc and FF values were also affected by the content of additional copolymers. After adding 5 wt% of the third copolymers, the ternary PSCs showed improved Jsc values of 16.41 mA cm−2, 17.00 mA cm−2 and 16.94 mA cm−2, and elevated FF values of 67.4%, 69.2% and 67.6% for the PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT devices, respectively, which resulted in an obvious increase in the respective PCEs to 8.46%, 8.65%, and 8.59%. When the additive amount was increased to 10 wt%, the device performance could be further improved. For example, the PBDTT-TANT device exhibited a much higher PCE of 9.35% with a simultaneously increased Voc of 0.75 V, Jsc of 17.64 mA cm−2 and FF of 70.7%. However, by continuously increasing the amount of the third copolymers added to 15 wt% and 20 wt%, the device performance would gradually decrease, which is attributable to the gradual decrease in Jsc and FF values. EQE measurements of the ternary PSCs were subsequently performed to better illuminate the above enhancement in Jsc. As shown in Fig. 2b, the control binary device exhibited a maximum EQE value of 67%. On the other hand, the ternary devices with 10% PBDTT-TABT, or 10% PBDTT-TANT or 10% PBDTT-TSNT showed higher maximum EQE values of 70%, 75% and 72%, respectively. To examine their accuracy, the Jsc values were also calculated from integration of the EQE curves with the AM 1.5G reference spectrum. The calculated Jsc values are close to those obtained from J–V measurement.

As discussed above, absorption compensation is an effective strategy to make sufficient usage of sunlight, thus greatly increasing the Jsc value. The UV-vis absorptions of PTB7:PC71BM, PTB7:PBDTT-TABT (10 wt%)/PC71BM, PTB7:PBDTT-TANT (10 wt%):PC71BM and PTB7:PBDTT-TSNT (10 wt%):PC71BM films were then measured. As shown in Fig. 4a, the addition of the third copolymers would positively increase the absorption of binary PTB7:PC71BM blend in the wavelength region between 300 and 600 nm, which was in good agreement with the related EQE curve. However, the binary blend displayed higher absorption in the wavelength region beyond 600 nm, but brought about a lower EQE response. This might originate from its relatively low crystallinity, hole-mobility and inferior morphology (vide infra), resulting in inadequate charge separation and extraction. Obviously, PBDTT-TANT had the highest extinction coefficient,44 which induced the best absorption of its ternary blend, and thus increased the Jsc to the largest extent in the respective ternary PSCs.

The charge transport property of the active blend is significantly associated with the crystallinity of the conjugated polymers. A feasible way to improve the carrier mobilities of the active layers is to increase the crystallinity by adding additional highly crystalline copolymers or small molecules.24,33 To investigate the effect on the crystallinity of the ternary blends of adding the third copolymers, X-ray diffraction was conducted on PTB7, PTB7:PBDTT-TABT (10 wt%), PTB7:PBDTT-TANT (10 wt%), and PTB7:PBDTT-TSNT (10 wt%) blend films, respectively (Fig. 4b). Because of relatively low crystallinity, the pristine PTB7 film exhibited two weak broad diffractions, identified as (100) and (010) diffractions with 2θ in the ranges of 2.5–5° and 20–30°, which were ascribed to lamellar stacking and π–π stacking, respectively. By adding 10 wt% copolymers, the diffraction peaks increased in height and were right-shifted. The (100) peaks were around 2θ = 4.64°, 4.76°, 5.05°, 4.88°, and the (010) peaks were around 2θ = 22.7°, 23.0°, 23.2°, 23.2° for PTB7:PBDTT-TABT (10 wt%), PTB7:PBDTT-TANT (10 wt%) and PTB7:PBDTT-TSNT (10 wt%), respectively, corresponding to a lamellar stacking distance (dl) of 19.1 Å, 18.8 Å, 17.7 Å, 18.4 Å, and a π–π stacking distance (dπ) of 3.90 Å, 3.86 Å, 3.83 Å, 3.83 Å. The strongest diffraction response with the smallest dl and dπ values for PTB7:PBDTT-TANT (10 wt%) implied the highest crystallinity, which could be responsible for the highest Jsc value in the resulting ternary blend PSCs. The hole mobilities of the PTB7-based binary and ternary blend films were also measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.48 Hole-only devices were then fabricated using the architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au. As shown in Fig. 4c, the hole mobilities of the ternary blends are 2.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 4.80 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 2.90 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PTB7:PBDTT-TABT (10 wt%), PTB7:PBDTT-TANT (10 wt%) and PTB7:PBDTT-TSNT (10 wt%), respectively, which are higher than that of the PTB7 binary blend (1.37 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The results indicated that adding a certain amount of the above third copolymers into the PTB7-based binary blend could increase the crystallinity, leading to enhanced carrier mobilities.21
The photocurrent density versus effective voltage (Jph–Veff) curves of PSCs have been used to investigate their charge collection efficiency.49,50Jph = JL − JD, where JL is the current density under illumination and JD is the current density in the dark. Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph = 0 and V is the applied voltage (Fig. 4d).49,50Jph has a nearly linear dependence on the voltage at a low value of Veff, and reaches saturation (Jsat) when the effective voltage Veff increases. For the PTB7 binary control device, the Jph showed a stronger field-dependence across a large bias range and saturated at even higher Veff, indicating a significant geminate and/or bimolecular recombination and less efficient interfacial contact, leading to a lower FF compared with those of ternary blend devices. By adding an amount of the third components, the Jph/Jsat values shifted to higher values, which were 0.89, 0.91, 0.94 and 0.92 for PTB7-based binary and PBTT-TABT, PBTT-TANT, and PBTT-TSNT-based ternary devices, respectively, confirming the enhanced exciton dissociation and charge collection.
Apart from the improvement in absorption and crystallinity discussed above, the higher performance might also come from the improved energy and charge transfer enabled by the third component.32 To study the possible working mechanisms, a photoluminescence (PL) study was conducted. As shown in Fig. 5, the wide bandgap polymer donors exhibited PL peaks around 720 nm, which were located within the absorption range of PTB7 (Fig. 1). After blending these polymers with PTB7, their characteristic PL peaks declined. Only one PL peak came from PTB7: that located around 830 nm. This observation indicated that there was energy transfer from these wide bandgap polymers to low bandgap PTB7, which would reduce the radiation recombination in the ternary blends. It was interesting to find that compared to the pristine PTB7 PL septum, PTB7:10% PBDTT-TABT exhibited a higher PL intensity while PTB7:10% PBDTT-TANT and PTB7:10% PBDTT-TSNT displayed a lower PL intensity. Besides the energy transfer, charge transfer might have occurred between PTB7 and PBDTT-TANT (or PBDTT-TSNT), but no charge transfer was found in the PTB7:PBDTT-TABT blend.22,40 Thus, devices based on pure polymers or polymer blends without PC71BM as the active layers were fabricated (Fig. S5–S7, ESI†). The J–V curves of PTB7:PBDTT-TANT and PTB7:PBDTT-TSNT exhibited higher Jsc values than their pristine polymer counterparts (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†), which implied that the charge transfer between PTB7 and PBDTT-TANT (or PBDTT-TSNT) occurred at the PTB7:PBDTT-TANT (or PBDTT-TSNT) interface.51 In contrast, PTB7:PBDTT-TABT devices displayed Jsc values between those of the PTB7 and PBDTT-TABT devices, indicating negligible charge transfer between PTB7 and PBDTT-TABT (Fig. S7, ESI†).45,46,52 Such differences originated mainly from the energy level differences between these components. PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT have HOMO and LUMO levels which are both lower than those of PTB7 (Fig. 1c), favoring hole transfer from PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT to PTB7 and electron transfer from PTB7 to PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT (Fig. 5b).40 However, PBDTT-TABT has a lower HOMO level but a higher LUMO level (Fig. 1c), which prevent the electron transfer from PTB7 to PBDTT-TABT, blocking the effective charge transfer between them (Fig. 5b).22 Therefore, it is reasonable that PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT-based ternary devices exhibited higher efficiencies than that of PBDTT-TABT-based ternary devices. Moreover, PTB7:10% PBDTT-TANT displayed the highest PL quenching property and the highest Jsc, implying the best charge transfer efficiency, which thus contributed to the highest device performance in the ternary blend PSCs.

2.3 Photovoltaic performances of the multiple blend PSCs
To further reduce the charge transfer barrier within the components of the active layer and to decrease the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes, an inorganic semiconductor with a more continuous band-like structure would be expected to obtain a panchromatic absorption coverage.39 Therefore, the well-defined energy cascade alignment would provide a suitable prerequisite for good charge collection.24 Bearing these in mind, we fabricated further multiple blend devices by introducing two or more additional donor materials in order to comprehensively investigate the bridge effect. Quaternary blends, PTB7 (90%):(PBDTT-TSNT:PBDTT-TABT) (10%):PC71BM (150%), PTB7 (90%):(PBDTT-TANT:PBDTT-TABT) (10%):PC71BM (150%), PTB7 (90%)/(PBDTT-TANT:PBDTT-TSNT) (10%)/PC71BM (150%), and quintuple blend PTB7 (90%):(PBDTT-TANT:PBDTT-TSNT:PBDTT-TABT) (10%):PC71BM (150%) were then studied and the blending ratios were systematically optimized. Based on the optimized device performance of the ternary blend PSCs, the total addition amount was kept at 10 wt% (Fig. S8–S11 and Table S1, ESI†). The best device performances of these multiple blend PSCs are also shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2.

By introducing two additional copolymer donors at the same time, synchronously improved Jsc and FF values were observed in the quaternary blend PSCs. The optimized PCE obtained was 9.83% with the addition of 6 wt% PBDTT-TANT and 4 wt% PBDTT-TSNT, with a Voc = 0.75 V, a Jsc = 17.83 mA cm−2, and an FF = 73.5%. Similar improvements could also be achieved in the quaternary blend PSCs by blending 2 wt% of PBDTT-TABT and 8 wt% PBDTT-TANT (or PBDTT-TSNT), yielding a PCE of 9.58% (or 9.27%). It is exciting that a much higher PCE of 10.40% was finally obtained when all three copolymers were mixed in a ratio of 2 wt% PBDTT-TABT, 4 wt% PBDTT-TANT and 4 wt % PBDTT-TSNT. The elevation in device performance was mainly attributed to the enhancements in Jsc (18.24 mA cm−2) and FF (75.4%), as discussed above. The significantly improved Jsc and FF values should come from the improved crystallinity and optimized morphology by incorporating high-crystallinity polymers into the PTB7-based binary blend, which contributed to the enhanced carrier mobility and thus reduced the charge recombination.21,26 In addition, the ternary blends provided more charge transfer channels, which could also suppress the charge recombination and had a positive effect on enhancing the Jsc and FF values in the devices.21,32 The improved Jsc was confirmed by EQE evaluation and reached a plateau of over 80% for the champion device (Fig. 6b). The promoted EQE response could also be found in a wider wavelength range from 400 to 700 nm in the multiple blend devices over those of the ternary blend counterparts. Because the absorptions of the multiple blends and the ternary blends exhibited little variation (Fig. 7a), the enhanced EQE response should not only be due to the improvements in absorption, but also to the more efficient exciton separation and diffusion (vide infra).

(c) Jph as a function of effective voltage plots of the optimized multiple blends. (d) J1/2–V characteristics of the hole-only devices measured at ambient temperature. 
Similar to the ternary blends, the XRD diffractions of the multiple blends exhibited a (100) peak at around 4.85° and a (010) peak at around 23.0°, corresponding to a dl of 18.2 Å and a dπ of 3.86 Å (Fig. 7b). The intensity of the XRD patterns for quaternary blends increased slightly with an elevation in the related device performance, which was a little weaker than that of the PBDTT-TANT-based ternary blend. The quintuple blend which featured the best device performance also exhibited a slightly decreased diffraction intensity than those of the quaternary blends. The results indicated that the introduction of PBDTT-TANT could improve the crystallinity of the multiple blends, but PBDTT-TABT had little effect. Hole mobilities were measured to be 3.42 × 10−4, 4.36 × 10−4, 6.41 × 10−4 and 7.83 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the multiple blends of PTB7 (90%):(PBDTT-TSNT:PBDTT-TABT) (10%), PTB7 (90%):(PBDTT-TANT:PBDTT-TABT) (10%), PTB7 (90%):(PBDTT-TANT:PBDTT-TSNT) (10%):PC71BM (150%), and PTB7 (90%):(PBDTT-TANT:PBDTT-TSNT:PBDTT-TABT) (10%):PC71BM (150%), respectively, which were in accord with the variation trend of the measured Jsc values (Fig. 7c). In addition, these multiple blends exhibited more effective charge extraction at low Veff: the Jph/Jsat values were over 0.95 due to the more continuous energy level alignment, as discussed above (Fig. 7d).
To study the evolution in morphology induced by adding the additional copolymers, atom force microscopy (AFM) was conducted on different optimized blend films. As shown in Fig. 8, all the blends exhibited a similar morphology without distinct changes, which indicated that these copolymers had good miscibility with each other. The root-mean-square (RMS) of the PTB7 binary blend was 1.30 nm. After adding the third copolymers, it increased to 1.38 nm, 1.54 nm, and 1.45 nm for PBDTT-TABT-, PBDTT-TANT- and PBDTT-TSNT-based ternary blends, respectively. The slightly higher RMS values originated from the molecular aggregation enabled by the introduced copolymer additive, which further facilitated the nanophase separation. As for the multiple blend system, it was measured to be 1.40 nm, 1.44 nm, and 1.49 nm for the quaternary blends of PTB7 (90%):(PBDTT-TSNT:PBDTT-TABT) (10%):PC71BM (150%), PTB7 (90%):(PBDTT-TANT:PBDTT-TABT) (10%):PC71BM (150%), PTB7 (90%):(PBDTT-TANT:PBDTT-TSNT) (10%):PC71BM (150%), respectively, and 1.47 nm for the quintuple blend of PTB7 (90%):(PBDTT-TANT:PBDTT-TSNT:PBDTT-TABT) (10%):PC71BM (150%), which were lower than that of PTNT-based ternary blend. Compared to the PTB7 binary blend, the slightly enhanced nanophase separation could be favorable for efficient charge transport, leading to higher Jsc, FF and PCE values. However, excessive PBDTT-TANT would induce much larger domain aggregation and thus decrease the corresponding photovoltaic performances.

To comprehensively understand the multiple blend effect, the photovoltaic data were collated and plotted onto 2D ternary contour maps, in which the weight ratios of PBDTT-TANT (x), PBDTT-TSNT (y) and PBDTT-TABT (z) were set as the three variables (Fig. 9). In these ternary contour maps, the respective copolymer amount in the PBDTT-TABT:PBDTT-TANT:PBDTT-TSNT system was defined as (x, y, z), where x + y + z = 10%.

As shown in Fig. 9, all four maps exhibited three main areas: blue sea, green land and red mountain. It is interesting to find that none of the photovoltaic parameters, including Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE, reached the mountain top in the 2D ternary contour maps by just blending a single copolymer additive. The highest Voc was around (2, 2, 6), while the maximum values of both Jsc and FF were located around (4, 4, 2). Compared to Jsc and FF, Voc had little impact on the final device performance. The additional PBDTT-TABT could improve the Voc of the PSCs (Fig. 9a, red area) but it decreased the related Jsc (Fig. 9b, blue area) and FF (Fig. 9c, blue area). The amount of PBDTT-TANT exhibited the largest effect on Jsc (Fig. 9b, red area) and FF (Fig. 9c, red area); however, the corresponding devices showed the lowest Voc (Fig. 9a, blue area). PBDTT-TSNT blends with a high content (over 6%) were located mainly in the green land, which indicated that adding a proper amount of PBDTT-TSNT could give rise to much higher Jsc and FF values. Therefore, a synergetic effect of the three copolymer additives used pushed the device performance up from the bottom of the blue sea to the top of the mountain (Fig. 9d). The PCE map could be divided into five main parts. PBDTT-TABT devices dominated the blue and green parts, representing the lowest PCEs. On the other hand, PBDTT-TSNT devices dominated the yellow part, representing medium PCEs. Clearly, PBDTT-TANT dominated the red part, which would bring out the highest device performance. As a result, the crimson part for the highest PCE could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the three additional copolymers. The 2D ternary contour maps revealed the influence and status of these studied copolymers, which contributed to an intensive understanding of the mechanism of multiple blends for seeking highly efficient multiple blend PSCs.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a feasible way to realize highly efficient multiple blend PSCs by simultaneously blending a series of copolymer analogues with a well-defined energy level alignment. The similar backbones of the additional copolymers guaranteed their good compatibility with each other. By changing the side-chains to ones with different electronic states, the absorption, energy levels and crystallinity of the copolymer additives could be fine-tuned. Due to their low-lying HOMO levels, these copolymers performed as hole-cascade polymeric donors in PTB7-based ternary PSCs. The strong electron-withdrawing property of the 2D conjugated side chains could also contribute to more effective exciton separation and charge transportation. After adding 10 wt% of these polymeric additives, PCEs of 8.96%, 9.35% and 9.18% were achieved for PBDTT-TABT-, PBDTT-TANT- and PBDTT-TSNT-based ternary devices, respectively. The PBDTT-TANT-based ternary device exhibited the smallest Voc of 0.75 V; however, the Jsc of 17.64 mA cm−2 and FF of 70.7% could be enhanced to their largest values, yielding a PCE of 9.35%, which originated from the more efficient charge and energy transfer processes in such ternary systems. By introducing a greater number of different bandgap copolymers with similar molecular backbones, steadier energy level alignment and more charge transfer channels were formed in the PSCs without destroying the compatibility and the morphology of the active layer, and this could promote further charge transfer more smoothly than the respective binary and ternary PSCs. When 4 wt% PBDTT-TANT, 4 wt% PBDTT-TSNT and 2 wt% PBDTT-TABT were added into the PTB7:PC71BM pristine binary blend, the multiple blend devices showed the highest PCE of 10.40%, which is the best efficiency for PTB7-based single-junction PSCs reported so far. Our work demonstrated a facile design strategy via multiple blend engineering to increase Voc, Jsc and FF simultaneously for achieving highly efficient PSCs.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials
PTB7 was purchased from 1-material Chemscitech Inc. (Canada), and PC71BM was purchased from Solenne BV (Netherlands) with 99% purity. PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT were synthesized according to our previously reported literature.43 All the other chemicals were purchased as reagent grade from Aladdin, Adamas, Aldrich, and Alfa Aesar Chemical Co., and used without further purification.
4.2 Device fabrication
The PSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al. The active layer varied from the binary blend to the quintuple blend, and the D/A ratio was kept at 1:1.5 (w/w) for all types of devices. Here, the ternary blends were defined as PTB7:PBDTT-TABT:PC71BM, PTB7:PBDTT-TANT:PC71BM and PTB7:PBDTT-TSNT:PC71BM, the quaternary blends were defined as PTB7:PBDTT-TANT:PBDTT-TABT:PC71BM, PTB7:PBDTT-TSNT:PBDTT-TABT:PC71BM, and PTB7:PBDTT-TANT:PBDTT-TSNT:PC71BM, and the quintuple blend was PTB7:PBDTT-TANT:PBDTT-TSNT:PBDTT-TABT:PC71BM. A glass substrate with a pre-patterned ITO (sheet resistance = 15 Ω □−1) was ultrasonically cleaned in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol in turn. The cleaned ITO substrates were dried and treated with UV-ozone for 20 min in order to increase their work function and hydrophilicity. A thin layer of 30 nm poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrene sulphonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) (Bay P VP AI4083, Bayer AG) was then spin-coated on the ITO substrate at 5000 rpm for 60 s and baked at 140 °C for 15 min in air. The different blends in chlorobenzene solution with 3 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) were subsequently spin-coated onto the surface of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The thickness of the active layer was controlled at about 100–110 nm (measured using a Dektak 6 M surface profilometer). Finally, a calcium (ca. 20 nm) and aluminum cathode (ca. 100 nm) were evaporated in turn onto the surface of the photosensitive layer at a high chamber pressure of ∼5.0 × 10−5 Pa. The device area was 0.04 cm2. All fabrication processes were conducted in a glove box.
4.3 Measurements and characterization
The I–V characterization of the devices was carried out on a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measurement system. The EQE values were tested with a Newport Model 77890 (Newport Co. Ltd) during illumination with monochromatic light from a xenon lamp. A solar simulator was used as the light source, and the light intensity was monitored by a standard Si solar cell. UV-vis spectra were obtained on a Cary 300 spectrophotometer. XRD patterns of the blends were recorded on a Philips X-ray diffractometer operated in reflection geometry at 40 mA, 40 kV with CuKα radiation. AFM images were obtained by using a Bruker Inova atomic microscope in tapping mode.
