    , Accepted 18th August 2017First published on 18th August 2017AbstractOpen circuit voltage (Voc) is a critical parameter for ternary organic solar cells, while its mechanism is obscure. Here we employed two non-fullerene molecules TPE-4PDI and FT-2PDI (perylenediimide, a PDI-based small molecule) to form acceptor alloys with ITIC-Th (indacenodithieno, an IDDT-based small molecule) for ternary systems. The results demonstrated that the experimental Voc values fit the simulation data accurately based on the equation not only in our new ternary systems but also in other reported small molecular alloy based ternary systems. More importantly, TPE-4PDI is more efficient to enhance the Voc of ternary solar cells as the third component than FT-2PDI, since TPE-4PDI possesses a larger quasi frontier orbital density (Ne) value. Thus, upon tuning the weight ratio of the TPE-4PDI:ITIC-Th acceptor alloy, high performance ternary solar cells with an efficiency over 11% were achieved. This contribution has shed light on understanding the mechanisms of ternary solar cells and demonstrated a method for enhancing Voc efficiently to achieve high performance solar cells.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted much attention in the past few decades due to their light weight, flexible structure and potential low cost fabrication.1–5 Consisting of a blend of a donor material and an acceptor material as the active layer, bulk heterojunction OSCs have shown remarkable progress and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 11% has been achieved.6,7 However, binary OSCs have disadvantages including insufficient light absorption, unbalanced charge mobility, and large energy loss to split excitons, which hinder the improvement of their PCE. The design of ternary structures is one effective strategy to solve these problems to further enhance the efficiency of OSCs. Through introducing one additional donor or acceptor material into binary blends, the light absorption, the energy levels and the morphology of blend films were tuned and optimized, which are beneficial to the short current density (Jsc), Voc, fill factor (FF), and thus PCE.8–11 As one of the important parameters, Voc is critical to achieve high performance OSCs since energy loss of Voc relative to the optical bandgap is the main reason for PCE loss.12,13 For charge transfer and energy transfer mechanisms, the Voc is close to that of binary solar cells,14–18 while the Voc changed along with the addition of the third component for the parallel and alloy mechanisms.19,20 Previously, we found that, when an acceptor alloy was composed of one fullerene derivative and one small molecule, the energy of the new molecular frontier orbital was influenced by the quasi frontier orbital density Ne of these two materials, which can be calculated according to eqn (1), where Voc Binary1, Voc Binary2 and Voc Ternary are the Voc of binary solar cells and ternary solar cells, Ne1 and Ne2 are the quasi frontier orbital densities of acceptor 1 and acceptor 2 in the acceptor alloy, and f1 and f2 are the weight composition ratios of acceptor 1 and acceptor 2 in the acceptor alloy. The experimental data fit the simulation line accurately, though the single ternary system is limited.21 (1)
Compared with fullerene derivatives, small molecules possess advantages such as excellent absorption of visible light, tunable molecular structures and morphological stability.22–24 Not surprisingly, state-of-the-art OSCs based on non-fullerene materials have shown encouraging development.25–28 Sun et al. used two non-fullerene acceptors to fabricate non-fullerene ternary OSCs with a PCE over 10%.29 They discovered that the Voc adopted a linear relationship with respect to the content of the third component. Subsequently, McCulloch and coworkers reported other non-fullerene ternary OSCs with a PCE over 11%,30 which is the highest PCE of non-fullerene ternary OSCs to date. However, the mechanisms of the Voc are obscured in both systems, though it is critical to design novel high-efficiency ternary systems.
Herein, we utilized two small molecules TPE-4PDI and FT-2PDI with different Ne values as the third component,31–33 respectively to combine with classical semiconductor materials, poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th)34 and ITIC-Th,35,36 to probe the mechanisms of Voc. The results showed that the Voc of small molecule ternary OSCs fits the simulation line based on eqn (1). Importantly, ternary solar cells based on TPE-4PDI:ITIC-Th with a higher Ne value demonstrated higher Voc than FT-2PDI:ITIC-Th based ternary solar cells at the same weight ratio, which is beneficial to improve the PCE of OSCs. As a result, the optimized PCE of TPE-4PDI:ITIC-Th based ternary solar cells was improved from 8.34% to 9.18% with the enhancement of all three important parameters, Voc, Jsc and FF. The high performance ternary systems were systematically studied by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), atomic force microscopy (AFM), impedance spectroscopy, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD), resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to probe the mechanism of charge generation and collection. To demonstrate the versatile applications, the acceptor alloy TPE-4PDI:ITIC-Th was combined with another donor material, poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T),25 to fabricate ternary solar cells, which exhibited a high efficiency over 11%.
Results and discussion
Materials synthesis and characterization
The chemical structures and the energy levels of all materials are shown in Fig. 1. The FT-2PDI was synthesized through coupling of the thiophene core with two PDI units, followed by oxidative fusion with FeCl3 according to a reported method.33 The structure was identified by 1H and 13C NMR and MALDI-TOF. The TPE-4PDI and FT-2PDI adopt similar LUMO energy levels which are higher than that of ITIC-Th, and thus can increase the Voc of PTB7-Th:ITIC-Th based binary solar cells. Meanwhile, both TPE-4PDI and FT-2PDI absorb light in the spectral range from 400 nm to 550 nm, offering complementary absorption to ITIC-Th as shown in Fig. 2(a).

TPE-4PDI adopts a 3D-star “core-arm” configuration, which can generate the quasi molecular orbitals.37,38 The density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the electron was delocalized on four different “arms”. Thus, the four quasi-degenerate LUMOs of TPE-4PDI have little energy difference (<0.1 eV). On the other hand, FT-2PDI and ITIC-Th possess no quasi-degenerate LUMOs due to their fused structures and electron delocalization among the whole backbone as shown in Fig. S1.† In this way, “Ne” values of these materials were calculated (ESI II†) and the results are listed in Table 1. As expected, the “Ne” value of ITIC-Th is about 0.57 times that of TPE-4PDI, and is about 1.09 times that of FT-2PDI. The distinct difference in “Ne” values suggested TPE-4PDI and FT-2PDI to be excellent choices to investigate the relationship between Voc and Ne in ternary systems.

According to the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements as shown in Fig. S2 and S3,† the reduction potentials of TPE-4PDI:ITIC-Th and FT-2PDI:ITIC-Th varied along with the change of the content of the third component, which indicates that both of them had formed acceptor alloys,39–41 which provided the basis to study the mechanisms of Voc.
Device fabrication and results
By utilizing PTB7-Th as the donor material, the ternary devices were fabricated with an inverted sandwich structure, ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. Ternary solar cell 1 (TSC1) was based on TPE-4PDI:ITIC-Th, while ternary solar cell 2 (TSC2) was composed of FT-2PDI:ITIC-Th. In order to optimize the performances of ternary solar cells, the weight ratios of TPE-4PDI:ITIC-Th and FT-2PDI:ITIC-Th were systematically tuned by dichotomy. The device performances of these two ternary solar cells are listed in Tables S1 and S2.† In both systems, the Voc was enhanced along with the increase of the third component (TPE-4PDI or FT-2PDI). For TSC1, with addition of 10% TPE-4PDI, all three parameters were enhanced simultaneously, resulting in an optimal efficiency of 9.07%, with a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 16.62 mA cm−2, and an FF of 68.2%, which is significantly higher than those in binary systems based on PTB7-Th:ITIC-Th (8.25%) or PTB7-Th:TPE-4PDI (4.90%). Similar phenomena were observed in TSC2. When 25% SF-2PDI were incorporated into the ternary system, an average efficiency of 8.87% was achieved with a Voc of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 16.10 mA cm−2, and an FF of 68.0%, much higher than those in binary systems based on PTB7-Th:ITIC-Th (8.25%) or PTB7-Th:TPE-4PDI (2.64%).
Analysis of Voc
In TSC1, the value of Ne ITIC-Th is half that of Ne TPE-4PDI, while it is similar to that of the Ne FT-2PDI in TSC2. Using eqn (1), the curves of Vocvs. third component content simulated by the MATLAB based on the value of Ne ITIC-Th, Ne TPE-4PDI, and Ne FT-2PDI provide excellent fit for the experimental data as shown in Fig. 2(b). Interestingly, the Voc of TSC1 is higher than that of TSC2 in all weight ratios due to the use of the higher Ne value material. These results suggested that employing a high Ne value material as the third component is an efficient method to steeply enhance Voc, one of the most important parameters of OSCs. Experimentally, the 3D-star structure with electron-deficient units as “arms” has potential to efficiently increase the Voc of ternary solar cells as the third component, since the high Ne value originates from the multiple identical sub-structures in the small molecule. In order to demonstrate the versatility of the Ne mechanism, we investigated two reported ternary systems based on small molecule alloys. One system employed DR3TSBDT (D1) and DRCN5T (D2) as donor alloys,42 and PCBM(70) as the acceptor, while the other system used TPE-4PDI(OD) (A1) and SF-4PDI (A2) as acceptor alloys, and PTB7-Th as the donor.43 The chemical structures and DFT calculations about these materials are shown in Fig. S4 and S5.† The calculated results of Ne of these materials are listed in Table 1. The Ne value of DR3TSBDT is about 0.72 times that of DRCN5T, and the Ne value of TPE-4PDI is about 0.81 times that of SF-4PDI. As shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d), the simulation lines based on eqn (1) match the experimental data in both systems. These results show strong evidence to support eqn (1). And more detailed discussion about eqn (1) can be seen in the ESI.†
Analysis of Jsc
TSC1 was chosen as an example to probe the influence of the third component on the charge generation and transport in the ternary system. To understand the enhancement of Jsc in the TSC1, UV-Vis absorption spectra and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the ternary systems were investigated. As shown in Fig. 3(a), with the increase of the content of TPE-4PDI, the absorption coefficient of the blend films increased from 450 nm to 550 nm, but decreased from 550 nm to 750 nm. Fig. 3(b) shows the EQE curves of the ternary solar cells with different ratios of TPE-4PDI. In general, the trend of EQE curves were consistent with the UV-Vis absorption spectra. However, when 10% TPE-4PDI was incorporated into PTB7-Th:ITIC-Th, EQE values were enhanced across the whole spectrum, different from the global absorption spectra as discussed above. Thus, the extra enhancement in EQE may be ascribed to the improved morphology or a better electronic state when TPE-4PDI was incorporated into specific functional domains. The deviations between the current densities integrated from EQE and those read from J–V measurements are mostly under 5%, indicating a good consistency of the photovoltaic results.

Furthermore, Jsc values of devices were measured at different light intensities (Plight) and the results are shown in Fig. 3(c). The relationship between Jsc and Plight can be described as (Jsc ∝ PlightS), where S can reflect the bimolecular recombination ratio of the blend film. The closer the value of S is to 1, the weaker the bimolecular recombination is. Here, the values of S were 1.018, 1.014 and 1.045 for 0%, 10% and 25% TPE-4PDI based devices, respectively, suggesting that the 10% TPE-4PDI devices may possess the weakest bimolecular recombination.44
AFM was employed to probe the roughness of five different blend films with 0%, 10%, 25%, 50% and 100% TPE-4PDI. The height and phase images of blend films are shown in Fig. S6 and S7.† The root-mean-square roughness of these five different blend films is 3.022 nm, 2.153 nm, 1.514 nm, 1.357 nm and 1.307 nm, respectively. As the amount of TPE-4PDI increases, the blend films turned smoother, which may be ascribed to its lower crystallinity compared to ITIC-Th. It is noted that smooth blend films can prevent the formation of the pin-holes on the surface and charge carrier recombination,45 and are beneficial to the interfacial contact between the active layer and the hole transfer layer (MoO3), resulting in high Jsc. To further study the charge-transfer resistance (RCT) at the interface, impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed in the dark. Fig. 3(d) shows the Nyquist plots of the measurement result, the equivalent circuit and the simulation line. All of the ternary blends have low values of sheet resistance (RS), consistent with the resistance of whole solar cells, indicating the remarkable device fabrication.46 The values of RCT of these blends with 0%, 10%, 25%, 50% and 100% TPE-4PDI are 4, 3, 7, 18 and 21 kΩ, respectively, which were represented by the diameter of the semicircle of Nyquist plots. The value of RCT of the 10% blend film is smaller than that of the 0% blend film, indicating that the former possessed the less energy loss due to the smoother surface than that of 0%.47 This is consistent with the higher Jsc of 10% blend film devices.
Morphology analysis
GIXD (Fig. 4) was employed to investigate the influence of TEP-4PDI on the morphology of the ternary system. Fig. 4(f) shows the two dimensional (2D) GIXD pattern for pristine films of PTB7-Th, where the (100) stacking peak appears at qxy = 0.28 Å−1 and a strong out-of-plane π–π stacking peak appears at qz = 1.60 Å−1, indicating that PTB7-Th favored the face-on orientation with respect to the substrate. Similar to the pristine film of PTB7-Th, a strong out-of-plane (010) stacking peak appears at qz = 1.80 Å−1 in the 2D GIXD pattern for the ITIC-Th's film, and there is also a lamella stacking peak that appears at qxy = 0.4 Å−1. However, there is no obvious sharp diffraction peak but a broad semiarc appears at scattering vector q = 1.25 Å−1 observed in the pristine film of TPE-4PDI, indicating the lower crystallinity compared to PTB7-Th and ITIC-Th.48 This lower crystallinity may contribute to the lower roughness of the 100% TPE-4PDI blend film than the 100% ITIC-Th blend film. In blend films, the (100) and (010) diffraction features of three materials were combined, resulting in more broad peaks. Not surprisingly, the (010) π–π stacking of PTB7-Th became indistinctive, indicating that the material stacking was perturbed when multiple components were added. For ITIC-Th, the lamella stacking peak appears at qxy = 0.49 Å−1, indicating the tighter packing compared to the pristine film. Importantly, the out-of-plane (010) stacking peak of PTB7-Th in the 10% TPE-4PDI ternary blend film is much stronger than that of the 0% TPE-4PDI blend film. This suggested that little amount of amorphous TPE-4PDI can significantly induce the face-on stacking of PTB7-Th, which benefits the charge transport in the blend film and enhances the FF of the device. Moreover, the out-of-plane (010) stacking peaks of PTB7-Th were also observed in the 25% and 50% blend films, but rather in the 100% blend film. This may be caused by the vast amount of amorphous TPE-4PDI disturbing the stacking of the polymer.

RSoXS and TEM were employed to study phase separation in ternary blends. As shown in Fig. S9,† the RSoXS profile of the PTB7-Th:ITIC-Th blend film showed a diffuse scattering at 0.01 Å−1, corresponding to phase separation of 63 nm (center-to-center distance), which indicated a large domain size of ∼32 nm, similar to the reported result. Meanwhile, the RSoXS profile of the PTB7-Th:TPE-4PDI blend film showed a diffuse scattering near to 0.02 Å−1, corresponding to a small domain size of about 15 nm. One should note that due to a similar chemical nature of PTB7-Th and TPE-4PDI, the contrast of these materials at different photon energies is small, resulting in an unclear profile.49 In addition, the RSoXS profile of 10% TPE-4PDI blend films showed a diffuse scattering at 0.012 Å−1, in accordance with a suitable domain size of about 26 nm, which is beneficial for exciton diffusion and separation. The TEM images also showed that the domain sizes gradually decreased along with the increased content of TPE-4PDI as shown in Fig. S10.†
Versatile applications of the acceptor alloy
In order to investigate the versatile applications of the acceptor alloy for high performance ternary solar cells, a medium bandgap donor polymer, PBDB-T50,51 was used to fabricate OSCs with the acceptor alloy, since the donor polymer offers complementary absorption to the acceptor alloy. Furthermore, the deep HOMO of PBDB-T may afford a high Voc for ternary OSCs. After optimization through varying the ratio of TPE-4PDI as listed in Table 2, the optimized PCE of ternary solar cells reached 11.04%, with a Voc of 0.87 V, a Jsc of 17.34 mA cm−2, and an FF of 73.2%. Again, all of the three parameters were enhanced in comparison to those in binary solar cells. The J–V curves and EQE curves are shown in Fig. S11.† Interestingly, when the 90% ITIC-Th + 10% TPE-4PDI mixture was used as the acceptor alloy, 0.02 V enhancement of Voc was achieved, which is the same as that of PTB7-Th based ternary solar cells. This also demonstrated that the 3D-structure TPE-4PDI, which has a high Ne value, is an efficient material for enhancing Voc. The 12% enhancement of PCE also suggests that this kind of acceptor alloy may be versatile for different high performance donor materials.

Conclusions
In summary, two different kinds of non-fullerene acceptor alloys were employed for high performance ternary solar cells to investigate the relationship between Ne and Voc. Together with the two reported systems, the results showed that the experimental data fit the theoretical values accurately, which demonstrated the generality of the Ne theory. Furthermore, we observed that the materials with higher Ne values as the third component can enhance the Voc of ternary solar cells more efficiently. Thus, using the 3D star small molecule TPE-4PDI as the third component afforded high-performance ternary solar cells with an efficiency over 11%. This contribution has shed light on understanding the mechanism of ternary solar cells and demonstrated a method for enhancing Voc efficiently to achieve high performance solar cells.
