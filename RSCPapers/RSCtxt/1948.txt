    , Accepted 30th April 2021First published on 30th April 2021AbstractCompared to bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) in organic solar cells (OSCs), planar heterojunctions (PHJs) avoid complicated morphology control entirely and morphology disorder caused by physical blending, and show huge potentials to realize less traps and better stability for OSCs. In this study, solution-processed fused-ring electron acceptors, replacing traditional fullerene acceptors such as C60 and C70, with several vacuum-deposited donors were employed to fabricate PHJ-OSCs. PHJ-OSCs exhibit a much lower trap density of 1015 cm−3 magnitude than that of BHJ counterpart devices (1016 cm−3 magnitude). Furthermore, PHJ-OSCs achieved the highest electroluminescence efficiency of 5.8 × 10−3 and the smallest non-radiative open-circuit voltage loss of 0.13 V in the field of OSCs to date. Meanwhile, PHJ-OSCs presented much better stability under illumination than BHJ devices. Moreover, this simple PHJ-OSC fabrication method can be further extended to different acceptor systems to build efficient and stable OSCs.
Introduction
Solar cells can directly transform solar energy into electric power, which is the one of the most popular alternative energies to fossil energy. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) constructed by organic blend active layers developed rapidly with power conversion efficiency (PCE) growing over 18%,1,2 and also showed great potentials in flexible and transparent optoelectronics. However, the metastable blend morphology is extremely complicated to be manipulated to acquire high PCE and long life time simultaneously, which block the progress of commercialization.3–5 Fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs), such as ITIC6 and its derivatives,7–11 have received flourishing development in past years, presenting flexible designed structures and high performance in BHJ OSCs.12 Very recently, Y6 FREA and its derivatives represented the state of the art of BHJ OSCs,13–15 but they still suffered relatively severe non-radiative recombination in BHJ films, compared to those of solar cells based on inorganic/hybrid semiconductors, such as crystalline silicon16 and hybrid perovskite.17 The severe non-radiative recombination results in a large open-circuit voltage (VOC) loss and is the one of main impediments to further enhance the PCEs of OSCs.18 Furthermore, BHJ-OSCs also suffered from the stability issues of worse photo-stability, which can be partly attributed to the unstable blend morphology.19
The planar heterojunction (PHJ) configuration born before the BHJ configuration in OSCs,20 but has drawn less attention in recent years.21–24 Through sequential spin-coating and/or blade coating, the pseudo planar junction can be layer-by-layer achieved without a clear donor/acceptor interface even though using orthogonal solvents,25–28 in which the morphology disorder of the mixed regions, such as in BHJ, could induce harmful trap states and metastable phase, resulting in energy disorder and phase separation. The energy disorder caused by the disordered morphology is one of the main sources of electronic traps in OSCs.29 Vacuum-deposited PHJ can form a strict interface between donor and acceptor layers, realizing the perfect p–n junction structure and minimizing the trap density induced by physical blending. However, the traditional vacuum-deposited materials such as C60 and C70 possess wide band gaps and short exciton diffusion lengths (7–20 nm),30 which limit the absorption and transformation of photo energy. FREAs exhibit super extinction coefficient at long wavelength regions and relatively long exciton diffusion lengths (20–45 nm),30 but cannot be vacuum deposited because of the high sublimation point.
In this study, we employed Y6, a widely-used high performance FREA, and varied vacuum-deposited donors (VDDs) to fabricate PHJ-OSC by combining vacuum deposition and solution process. The as-fabricated PHJ-OSCs exhibited a high electroluminescence efficiency of 5.8 × 10−3, with an ultra-low non-radiative open-circuit voltage loss of 0.13 V, which is the smallest value for OSCs to the best of our knowledge,31–33 even comparable to hybrid perovskites.34 The trap density of the PHJ configuration (as low as 2 × 1015 cm−3) was one order lower than that of BHJ counterparts. The OSC devices with the PHJ configuration also behaved better photo-stability than BHJ devices. Moreover, this simple PHJ fabrication method can be further extended to different acceptor systems to build high performance OSCs and boost the industrial production process of OSCs.
Results and discussion
Solar cells with different configurations
To realize the strict PHJ (Fig. 1a), donor layers were fabricated via vacuum deposition on acceptor layers. Firstly, one of the most popular FREAs, Y6, was spin-coated from the chloroform solution on a indium-tin-oxide (ITO)/zinc oxide (ZnO) substrate. Then, VDDs, including rubrene (Rub), ditolylaminothienyl–benzothiadiazole–dicyanovinylene (DTDCTB) (Fig. 1b), and others (Fig. S1a, ESI†), were deposited on the top of the Y6 film, respectively, followed by depositing MoO3 and Ag to construct inverted devices with ITO/ZnO/FREA/VDD/MoO3/Ag. The deposition of donors on acceptor films avoids diffusion always happening in the pseudo-bilayer configuration by sequential solution processing.22 For comparison, the inverted devices with the BHJ configuration of Rub:Y6 and DTDCTB:Y6 were fabricated through one step spin-coating method using the blend solution. The devices with PHJ and BHJ configurations were controlled to the same thickness (ca. 70 nm) during fabrication. The energy levels of photovoltaic materials are presented in Fig. 1b and Fig. S1b (ESI†). The Rub and DTDCTB donors have higher highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels (−5.4 eV for Rub35 and −5.30 eV for DTDCTB36) and higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels (−3.2 eV for Rub and −3.44 eV for DTDCTB), than those of the Y6 (HOMO/LUMO, −5.65/−4.05 eV37) acceptor, which can generate an efficient drive force for exciton dissociation on the acceptor/donor interface. However, the other two VDDs we used, namely pentacene (Pen) and α-sexithiophene (α-6T), possessed HOMO levels with −4.9 eV38 and −4.7 eV,39 respectively, much higher than that of Y6, resulting in large energy losses and relative low VOC in the OSC devices (Table 1). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of thin film samples of the single component (Y6, Rub, and DTDCTB), BHJ configuration (Rub:Y6 and DTDCTB:Y6), and PHJ configuration (Rub/Y6 and DTDCTB/Y6), are shown in Fig. 1c and d. The film of Rub showed two absorption peaks at 497 nm and 531 nm, and the film of DTDCTB showed a wide single absorption peak at 684 nm, and both of them were complement with the absorption spectra of Y6. When forming bilayer films and blend films, the absorption onset of Y6 red-shifted, indicating that the effective coupling of local-excitation and charge transport (CT) state happened between the donor and acceptor in both configurations, corresponding to the unobvious CT absorption shoulders for both configurations discussed below.40,41

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices are given in Fig. 2a and b. For Rub-based devices, the BHJ device exhibited a PCE of 1.22% with a Voc of 0.509 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 7.25 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 32.9%, respectively. However, the counterpart PHJ device delivered an extremely higher VOC of 0.927 V with an improved photovoltaic PCE of 1.35%. For the device employed DTDCTB as donor, the VOC of the PHJ configuration was much high than its BHJ counterpart as well; the BHJ device exhibited a PCE of 0.63% with a Voc of 0.379 V, a Jsc of 4.38 mA cm−2, a FF of 38.2%, respectively, and the corresponding PHJ device presented a higher PCE of 1.71%, with a higher Voc of 0.852 V, a Jsc of 5.03 mA cm−2, a FF of 39.9%, respectively. The dark current densities of devices with the PHJ configuration were over one order lower than those of the BHJ configuration in both devices employed Rub and DTDCTB, as shown in Fig. 2a and b, which was consistent with the higher Voc in the PHJ device than that in the BHJ device.42 The external quantum efficiency for devices employed Rub and DTDCTB with PHJ and BHJ configurations are illustrated in Fig. S2 (ESI†), in which the calculated integration current density with the AM 1.5G spectrum had <5% mismatch with the J–V measurement.

Open-circuit voltage loss analysis
The VOC of PHJ OSCs is higher than that of BHJ devices employing either Rub or DTDCTB donors, confirming that PHJ configurations benefit reduced VOC loss for OSCs. Given the devices used the same acceptor of Y6, Eopt of the devices with different configurations is the same of 1.33 eV. The VOC loss (ΔVloss) can be given by eqn (1):43 qΔVloss = Eopt − qVOC(1)where q is the elementary charge. ΔVloss of PHJ configurations can be quantified as 0.40 V for the Rub-based device and 0.48 V for the DTDCTB-based device, which are low to around half of those of BHJ counterpart devices (0.82 V for the Rub-based device, 0.95 V for the DTDCTB-based device).
To clarify the ingredients on the VOC loss of OSCs, we first investigated the Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy external quantum efficiency (FTPS-EQE) spectra of PHJ and BHJ devices. As shown in Fig. S3a and b (ESI†), the FTPS-EQE spectra of devices with the PHJ configuration and BHJ configuration did not show any sub-gap absorption features, implying that the interface between the donor and acceptor could drive charge generation and separation without strong low-energy CT states.44 Furthermore, the electroluminescence (EL) spectra of devices with different configurations were obtained. Fig. S3c and d (ESI†) show the normalized EL spectra of PHJ and BHJ OSCs, respectively. The Rub/Y6 device exhibited a strong EL peak of Y6 at 903 nm and a weak EL peak of Rub at 564 nm. In contrast, the EL peak of Y6 has the comparable intensity with that of Rub in the Rub:Y6 BHJ devices. DTDCTB/Y6 and DTDCTB:Y6 devices showed similar EL spectra of at 903 nm, which can be attributed to the EL of Y6. In all devices mentioned above, there are no obvious additional emission peaks from the CT states. Both of FTPS-EQE and EL measurements indicated the absence of the CT state in devices with PHJ and BHJ configurations, indicating that the radiative recombination energy loss was negligible in these devices.
Relative to the BHJ configuration, PHJ avoids physical blending, which is then promising in reducing the trap density caused by a disordered blend morphology and suppressing non-radiative recombination in the photovoltaic films. To verify this, we performed the thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS) method, which was successfully used in solar cell devices to characterize the trap density at varied energy depths in devices with either PHJ or the BHJ configuration.45 The energetic profile of the trap density of states (tDOS) can be described by a function of angular frequency-dependent capacitance according to eqn (2) and (3):45 (2) (3)where ω0 is the attempt-to-escape frequency, ω is the angular frequency of applied bias, C is the capacitance, kB is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature (taken at 300 K), W is the depletion width (approximated by thickness of the film), and Vbi is the built-in potential. W and Vbi were extracted from the Mott–Schottky analysis.46 For Rub-based devices, the trap density distributed in the range of 4 × 1015–5 × 1017 cm−3 (Fig. 3a) at varied energy depths. With an energy depth of 0.20–0.30 eV, the PHJ configuration showed the lowest trap density of 4 × 1015 cm−3, which was almost one order lower than that of the BHJ configuration and much lower than those values (1016–1018 cm−3) reported for the thin film of organic semiconductors.47 For the DTDCTB-based devices, the trap density distributed in the range of 2 × 1015–2 × 1018 cm−3 (Fig. 3b). Within the energy depth range of 0.10–0.20 eV, the PHJ configuration showed the lowest trap density of 2 × 1015 cm−3, which was also much lower than that of the BHJ configuration (2 × 1016 cm−3). In addition, the low trap densities of Rub and DTDCTB based devices with the PHJ configuration are comparable to the typical high-performance halide perovskite thin film (1014–1015 cm−3),29,48 and lower than those of some inorganic thin films (1016 cm−3 for amorphous silicon,49 and 1017 cm−3 for metal oxides50), which indicates the great potential to suppress non-radiative recombination and realize small non-radiative VOC loss in OSCs using the PHJ configuration.

Then, we investigated the non-radiative energy loss of devices quantificationally by electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) measurements. The non-radiative VOC loss (ΔVnr) of the OSCs caused by non-radiative recombination can be analyzed according to eqn (4):51,52 qΔVnr = −kBTln(EQEEL)(4)where kB is the Boltzmann's constant and T is the absolute temperature (taken at 300 K). The Rub/Y6 PHJ device exhibited an excited EQEEL of 5.8 ×10−3 at one sun equivalent injection current density, which is the highest values for high performance OSCs (Fig. 3c).31–33 In contrast, the Rub:Y6 BHJ device exhibited three-orders lower EQEEL of 6.7 ×10−6. Then, the calculated ΔVnr for the Rub/Y6 device was only 0.13 V, much lower than that (0.31 V) of Rub:Y6 BHJ device. The DTDCTB-based devices performed similar tendency (Fig. 3d). For the DTDCTB/Y6 PHJ device, the measured EQEEL was 2.1 ×10−4 and the calculated ΔVnr was 0.22 V. In contrast, the DTDCTB:Y6 BHJ device exhibited an EQEEL as low as 1.8 ×10−6 with a much higher ΔVnr of 0.34 eV. The reduced ΔVnr values observed in the PHJ configuration are well consistent with the lower trap densities in the PHJ configuration discussed above. These results confirmed that the pure donor and acceptor domains in the PHJ configuration ensured the minor structural disorder of the morphology and thus restrict the disorder of the energy, inducing less traps in the device and resulting in the minimized ΔVnr of the devices.
Stability analysis
Deterioration of the metastable morphology of blend films is one of the vital issues in the stabilizing performance of BHJ OSCs.53–56 In the PHJ configuration with the vacuum deposited top active layer (donor layer in our devices), there is no mixed regions between donor and acceptor layer. The separate double phases could avoid the metastable morphology in BHJ and result in photovoltaic layers with the stable morphology.57
We investigated the stability of devices employed Rub and DTDCTB as donor layers with PHJ and BHJ configurations under illumination. The devices were encapsulated in a glove box then exposed under a light emitting diode (LED) in air condition. The Rub/Y6 PHJ device exhibited a steady performance of average 94% of the initial value during 200 hours illumination (Fig. 4a). The slight decrease (6%) in the PCE was derived from the weak attenuation (6%) of VOC, which could be seen in Fig. 4b, while the JSC and FF of the Rub/Y6 PHJ device maintained almost 100% of the initial values during the whole stability test. The photo-stability of the Rub:Y6 BHJ device was much worse than that of the PHJ device. As shown in Fig. 4b–d, the VOC of the Rub/Y6 device dropped 30% after 200 hours illumination, accompanied with JSC and FF descending to 80% and 87% of the initial values separately, inducing a dramatic loss of a half of the original PCE. For the DTDCTB-based device, the PHJ configuration also performed better photo-stability than the BHJ configuration. The PCE of the DTDCTB:Y6 device decreased to 66% of the initial value after 25 hours illumination, while the DTDCTB/Y6 device performed the same drop of PCE after 200 hours illumination, indicating that the PHJ device damaged much slower than the BHJ device (Fig. 4e). The VOC of the PHJ device showed slower descending tendency than that of the BHJ device as well (Fig. 4f). Except that, the JSC and FF of the DTDCTB/Y6 device only lost 6% and 4% of the initial values individually after 200 hours illumination (Fig. 4g and h). In comparison, the device with the DTDCTB:Y6 BHJ configuration showed 80% left of JSC and FF. For either Rub or DTDCTB-based PHJ devices, JSC and FF exhibited excellent stability. According to previous study,4,19,58 the degradation of JSC and FF was strongly associated with the deterioration of the morphology. In the BHJ film, small nonfullerene photovoltaic molecules possessed low diffusion; thus, most probably form small scale isolated domains from the amorphous mixed regions in blend films as morphological traps, enhancing the charge trapping and recombination losses, and significantly reducing JSC and FF.4 However, in the PHJ configuration, the donor and acceptor layers formed their own domains separately, in which no isolated domains could generate in another layer. Thus, the disordered morphology was inhibited in the PHJ configuration, which benefited the constant charge transport during illumination. As a result, the morphology-related instability can be inhibited in the PHJ configuration to a large extent. Furthermore, the PHJ devices with Rub as the donor showed better stability than the PHJ device with DTDCTB as the donor. The DTDCTB film in the PHJ configuration obviously aggregated during irradiation and formed shallow pits dispersed on the whole donor film (Fig. S4, ESI†), which did not happen in the PHJ device based on Rub. The phenomenon inspired us to consider aggregation behavior of photovoltaic materials in the PHJ device construction in the future.

Conclusions
In summary, we employed the solution-processed FREA layer and VDD layer to fabricate PHJ OSCs, in which a simple bilayer structure avoided unfavorable phase separation in BHJ OSCs, but provided continuous pathways for hole and electron transport. The PHJ configuration showed a reduced non-radiative open-circuit voltage loss compared to the BHJ counterpart because of the decreased trap density in PHJ active layers. Moreover, the stability of PHJ devices under illumination was much better than that of BHJ OSCs, which can be partly attributed to the stable morphology of the PHJ film. The very high EQEEL of 5.8 ×10−3 with a very small ΔVnr of 0.13 V obtained in PHJ OSCs is the state-of-the-art for OSCs, and even comparable to some inorganic/hybrid counterparts. Developing organic photovoltaic materials with efficient exciton dissociation and/or long exciton diffusion is necessary for obtaining high PCEs of PHJ OSCs in the future. Along with good photo-stability, PHJ OSCs should be a promising candidate for efficient and stable OSC applications. The PHJ architecture should be given more attention in OSCs as well as in other electronic devices, such as ultrafast photodetectors, which require active layers with low trap density and stable morphology.
