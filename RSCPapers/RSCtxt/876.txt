S(TPA–DPP) exhibited excellent thermal stability, strong absorption, and very high open-circuit voltage (1.18 V) in solution-processed organic solar cells based on P3HT:S(TPA–DPP).
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are a promising cost-effective alternative for utility of solar energy, and possess light-weight, low-cost, and flexibility advantages.1 During the past decade, solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs have attracted much attention with encouraging power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 8%.2 With regard to photoactive materials, fullerenes and their derivatives, such as [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), have been the dominant electron acceptor materials in BHJ OSCs, due to their large electron affinity, high electron mobility and isotropy of charge transport.3 However, fullerenes have a few disadvantages, such as weak absorption in the visible region, high-cost production and purification. Furthermore, in a typical BHJ system of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):PC61BM, energy levels mismatching between a donor and an acceptor results in low open-circuit voltage (VOC) and energy loss. To solve these problems, new electron acceptor materials with strong and broad absorption spectra, appropriate energy levels and low cost are necessary. Recently, non-fullerene small molecule acceptors have been developed, however, very few reports on solution-processed fullerene-free OSCs have shown PCEs approaching or exceeding 2%.4 High anisotropy in light absorption and charge transport is a critical concern for one- and two-dimensional non-fullerene acceptor materials. To our knowledge, there have been no three-dimensional (3D) non-fullerene acceptors reported so far.
Due to several attractive properties of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) dyes, such as strong light absorption, good photochemical stability, and facile synthetic modification, DPP-based materials have been proven promising donors for OSCs;5 blended with fullerene acceptors, DPP-based small molecules yielded PCEs over 4%,6 and DPP-based polymers yielded PCEs over 6%.7 Since some DPP-based materials have exhibited very high electron mobility (>1 cm2 V−1 s−1),8 several linear DPP-based materials were also tested as acceptors in OSCs. However, these DPP-based acceptors provided low PCEs (≤1%), when blended with P3HT donors in BHJ devices.9
Triphenylamine (TPA) has special propeller starburst molecular structure due to the sp3 hybrid orbital of the nitrogen atom. As a result, amorphous materials with isotropic optical and charge-transporting properties could be expected when combining TPA with linear π-conjugated systems. Recently, we reported that solution-processed OSCs based on a star-shaped small molecule donor with TPA as a core gave PCEs up to 4.3% without any post-treatments, which is the highest reported for solution processed BHJ OSCs based on TPA-based molecules and star-shaped molecules.10
Here we report synthesis of a novel star-shaped acceptor based on TPA as a core and DPP as arms (S(TPA–DPP), Scheme 1) and its application in OSCs as the first example of a 3D non-fullerene acceptor. S(TPA–DPP) exhibited excellent thermal stability, strong absorption, and appropriate energy levels. Solution-processed BHJ OSCs based on P3HT:S(TPA–DPP) showed PCEs as high as 1.20%, with very high VOC up to 1.18 V. The VOC of 1.18 V is among the highest values reported for single OSCs.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route of S(TPA–DPP). 
S(TPA–DPP) was synthesized through high yield Suzuki coupling reaction between tris(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)amine and 3-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-6-(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c] pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst (Scheme 1). S(TPA–DPP) was fully characterized by MALDI-TOF MS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and elemental analysis (synthesis and characterization details, see ESI†). S(TPA–DPP) is readily soluble in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform and dichlorobenzene at room temperature, owing to six solubilizing 2-ethylhexyl substituents. The thermal properties of S(TPA–DPP) were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This star-shaped molecule exhibits excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) at 400 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S1, ESI†). The DSC traces for this compound show glass transition at ca. 100 °C and no melting peak from room temperature to 250 °C, suggesting that it could be amorphous (Fig. S2, ESI†).

Fig. 1a shows the normalized spectra of optical absorption of S(TPA–DPP) in dichloromethane solution (10−6 M) and in thin solid film. S(TPA–DPP) in solution exhibits relatively strong absorption with the maximum extinction coefficient of 4.69 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 596 nm. In thin film, S(TPA–DPP) shows a broader absorption band relative to that in solution, and the optical band gap estimated from the absorption edge (670 nm) of the thin film is 1.85 eV.

The electrochemical property of S(TPA–DPP) was investigated by a cyclic voltammetry (CV) method in film on a glassy carbon working electrode in 0.1 M [nBu4N]+[PF6]− CH3CN solution at a potential scan rate of 100 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 1b, S(TPA–DPP) exhibits irreversible reduction and quasi-reversible oxidation waves. The onset oxidation and reduction potentials versus FeCp2+/0 are 0.46 and −1.54 V, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energies were estimated to be −5.26 and −3.26 eV from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively, assuming the absolute energy level of FeCp2+/0 to be 4.8 eV below vacuum. The HOMO and LUMO energies are lower than those (−4.76 and −2.74 eV) of P3HT, respectively.11 The LUMO gap (0.52 eV) and HOMO gap (0.50 eV) between P3HT and S(TPA–DPP) are large enough to guarantee efficient exciton dissociation.12 The difference between the LUMO of S(TPA–DPP) and the HOMO of P3HT is as large as 1.5 eV, which could result in high VOC of solar cells.
To demonstrate potential applications of S(TPA–DPP) in OSCs, we used S(TPA–DPP) as an electron acceptor and classical polymer P3HT as an electron donor, and fabricated BHJ OSCs with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:S(TPA–DPP)/Ca/Al. Table 1 summarizes VOC, short circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and PCE of the devices at different donor/acceptor weight ratios. These devices yielded very high VOC as we expected, and the VOC values of 1.08–1.12 V are almost insensitive to the donor/acceptor weight ratio. The blend at donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:1 gave the best performance: VOC, JSC, FF and PCE reaches 1.12 V, 1.33 mA cm−2, 0.36 and 0.54%, respectively. Thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min improves JSC to 2.68 mA cm−2. Ultimately the improved JSC results in an enhanced efficiency of 1.20%, 122% enhancement compared to that for the as-cast device (Table 1 and Fig. 2a). Furthermore, the VOC of 1.18 V achieved in devices after thermal annealing is among the highest values reported for single OSCs; this result is mainly attributed to very large difference (1.5 eV) between the LUMO of S(TPA–DPP) and the HOMO of P3HT. The incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) of the blend film with donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:1 without and with annealing at 150 °C are shown in Fig. 2b. These blend films show broad IPCE spectra from 300 to 700 nm, and thermal annealing improves IPCE maximum to 16% at 475 nm along with a shoulder to 13% at 600 nm.

The active layer morphology was examined by an atomic force microscope (AFM) technique in tapping mode. The actual surface morphology of blend films of P3HT:S(TPA–DPP) (1:1, w/w) as cast and after annealing is shown in Fig. 3. The film as cast exhibits crystalline grains with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 7.0 nm. After thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min, the crystalline grains change to larger size domains, the roughness increases to 15.4 nm. The crystalline grains or domains are probably a result of P3HT self-organization, which is beneficial to ordered structure formation and charge transport in the thin film.13

The hole and electron mobilities in the BHJ blend film were measured by a space-charge limited current (SCLC) method with device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:S(TPA–DPP)/Au and Al/P3HT:S(TPA–DPP)/Al, respectively (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†). A hole mobility of 2.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 6.8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for the blend of P3HT and S(TPA–DPP) with annealing at 150 °C for 10 min, nevertheless the electron/hole mobility ratio (0.02) is relatively low, which led to low FF (<0.4) in OSC devices.
In summary, the first 3D star-shaped non-fullerene acceptor (S(TPA–DPP)) with TPA as a core and DPP as arms was synthesized. S(TPA–DPP) has excellent thermal stability, strong and broad absorption, and appropriate energy levels matched with P3HT. The BHJ OSCs based on P3HT:S(TPA–DPP) blend after annealing at 150 °C for 10 min gave a PCE of 1.20% and a very high VOC of 1.18 V. This preliminary work demonstrates that 3D small molecule acceptors with isotropic optical and charge-transporting properties may be promising non-fullerene acceptors for solution-processed OSCs.
