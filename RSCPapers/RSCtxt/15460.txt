    , Accepted 26th October 2022First published on 4th November 2022AbstractFour novel tri-substituted supramolecular materials (CTGC1–CTGC4) have been synthesized by converting cyclotriveratrylene to cyclotriguaiacyclene followed by esterification using 4-n-alkoxy derivatives of trans cinnamic acid (B1–B4). The synthesized materials were characterized by IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and MALDI-TOF analysis. The liquid crystalline properties of these cinnamate-based trimers were confirmed by polarized optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry and small and wide-angle X-ray scattering analysis. These compounds displayed an enantiotropic type columnar hexagonal (Colh) phase with broad thermal stability. The higher alkoxy tail substituted mesogens (CTGC3 and CTGC4) with decyloxy and tetradecyloxy groups stabilized the mesophase at 32.0 °C and 26.0 °C, respectively. The synthesized CTG-linked trans-cinnamic acid trimers with alkoxy side groups exhibited self-assembly, which makes them good candidates for device applications. The current–voltage relationship indicates the ohmic-type behavior for the pristine and 100 °C annealed films while 200 °C films showed deviation. The optical properties indicate the high transmittance of 200 °C annealed films in visible and near IR regions. As wide optical energy band gaps of 2.93 eV, 2.87 eV and 3.45 eV were observed for CTGC3 thin films, they could be utilized as optical window in second and transport layers in third generation solar cells.

Design, System, Application
Recent developments in liquid crystals with columnar self-assembly have permitted the development of functional supramolecular materials with self-assembly nature which are potentially active in the energy and electro-optic fields. Molecular engineering of these CTG-linked trans cinnamate based compounds are enabled to exhibit room temperature liquid crystalline properties with higher thermal stability. We have demonstrated CTG based molecular design and engineering to construct columnar mesogens and could be successfully applied as window layer for solar cell applications. The supramesogens based on a CTG core can serve as potential alternative candidates to implicate as optical window in second generation and transport layer in third generation solar cell devices while other constituent layers would need individual optimization to ensure desired performance.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, the demand for energy is increasing and with limited supply, the problem is compounded with potentially severe economic and social consequences. With limited availability of non-renewable energy sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas, there is a constant search for renewable energy sources such as solar cells, wind, hydro, tidal, geothermal and biomass to fulfill the demands of society. In this regard, fabrication of solar cells has gained much attention because of their ability to maximize the utilization of solar energy as an alternative energy source.1 Solar cells possess some versatile features such as versatility, compatibility, and flexible nature, besides low-cost and the possibility for scale up as compared to conventional expensive inorganic materials and polymers.2
Discotic liquid crystals (DLCs) are of tremendous interest as semiconducting materials due to their photoconducting abilities.3 DLCs having excellent charge-transport properties thus find wide applicability in preparing bilayer solar cells, and bilayer heterojunction solar cells.4 Gregg and Petritsch et al. were the first to report the photovoltaic effect in porphyrin and phthalocyanine-based DLCs.5 In a similar study, Schmidt-Mende et al. demonstrated a well-defined photovoltaic (PV) solar cell having hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC)-based DLCs.6 A better solar cell material comprises features like efficienct absorption of incident irradiance, efficient charge generation and efficient charge collection at the respective electrodes which contribute in photocurrent. So far cadmium-based materials with a wide energy band gap are used to transmit the maximum level of incident light to the respective absorption layer in solar cells.7,8 In CdTe based solar cells, CdS is widely used in the window layer preparation. However, due to the carcinogenic properties of this compound there is a need to have an alternative window material that should possess desired properties in view of CdS applicability so far. In this context, supramolecular compounds can serve as a suitable alternative due to their easy scale-up and purification process in fabrication of low-cost devices as compared to other organic or inorganic compounds.9,10
The columnar mesophase is a type of liquid crystalline state in which molecular compounds organize into a cylindrical type of self-assembly due to the presence of π–π interactions between the central cores with a peripheral alkoxy side chain.11–13 Further, researchers have focused on designing columnar phases with long-range order classified by 2D-lattices like hexagonal, rectangular, oblique, and tetragonal phases. Besides, lower crystalline tendency, fluorescent nature, higher temperature range, charge carrier mobility and thermal stability of materials are an important key factors for device fabrication.14–16 Furthermore, these materials are able to form 2D columnar structures which make them more promising materials for solar cells or photovoltaic applications.17–19 These materials are low-cost, processable, can be scaled up, self-healable with light emitting properties and also easy to operate in contrast with small organic molecules (single crystals). In addition, they exhibit higher conductivity, mobility, and supramolecular order than polymeric compounds.20,21 Reported molecular systems with central functionalized cores such as triphenylenes, heterocyclic compounds, calixarene, resorcinarene, porphyrins, perylene, and phthalocyanines have shown promising mesogenic properties.22–26
Cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) is a bowl-shape macrocyclic compound with C3-symmetry. The molecular cavity makes them more useful for molecular host–guest sensing applications.27 CTV is a cyclic trimer of the veratrole compound with a relatively rigid bowl-shape and crown conformation. The CTV functionalized materials with variable alkyl chain length have displayed nematic type mesogenic properties.28 Yang et al. synthesized CTV based triazole linked triphenylene units and investigated their liquid crystalline behaviour.29 Further, the demethylation of CTV was carried out using different reagents and reactions conditions to form a cyclotriguaiacyclene (CTG) core having three hydroxy groups.30 The hydroxyl groups of the CTG core can be easily substituted by various moieties for use in host–guest chemistry, self-assembly, sensing, and biomedical application, and in the formation of organic and metal-linked organic ligands (Fig. 1). Recently, 4-n-alkoxy trans-cinnamic acid is widely used as a linking unit to prepare a number of various shaped liquid crystals (LCs) with higher thermal stability, molecular rigidity and molecular length, and has provided enhanced stability to the mesophase compared to a normal ester linking unit.31–34

In this work, we have prepared CTG-linked trans-cinnamic acid with alkyl arm based columnar hexagonal liquid crystals and studied the impact of the alkyl chain length on the mesogenic properties. The results suggested that the CTG based cinnamate materials showed a columnar hexagonal mesophase in both heating and cooling cycles, with a stabilized mesophase below 50.0 °C. However, materials with higher alkoxy side arms stabilized the mesophase up to 25.0 °C. These tri-substituted supramesogens showed higher thermal stability and stable crown conformation displaying self-assembly at room temperature. Additionally, the synthesized CTG linked cinnamate based supramesogens were studied for optical and electrical properties to seek their applicability in devices by developing thin films on glass and indium doped tin oxide glass substrates through solution processed recipe. The prepared thin films were thermally annealed in air ambient at 100 °C and 200 °C. We successfully prepared thin films of selected CTG-linked cinnamate based compound with a decyloxy chain for suitability as optical window which may further replace toxic cadmium-based compounds in the next generation of solar cells.
2. Materials and method
All chemicals and reagents used in the study were procured from Avra Synthesis Private Limited (Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India). The solvents used were purified using reported standard methods. The synthesized compounds were purified by column chromatography using silica gel with 200–300 mesh size. The IR study was performed on a TENSOR 27 (Bruker) in the range of 3800–600 cm−1. The 1H and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance (500 MHz, 126 MHz) using CDCl3 solvent. The liquid crystalline phase was identified using a polarizing optical microscope (Nikon Eclipse LV-100 POL) with a temperature-controlled LTSE 420 heating stage (Linkam Scientific Instruments, Tadworth, Surrey, UK) for temperature regulation. The confirmation of the mesophase state was done employing a Shimadzu DSC-50, at heating and cooling rates of 10 °C min−1. The XRD measurements were performed on a Rigaku-Ultima IV powder diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα source (λ = 1.5418 Å and 1.6 kW, X-ray tube with applied voltage and current values as 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively) and also a Philips X'PERT MPD. For sample analysis, glass capillaries were used for the measurements. To seek applicability as optical and constituent layers in devices, the thin films of optimized materials were developed where optical properties were studies by a Shimadzu modeled UV-1780 UV-visible spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 300–900 nm. Further, the current–voltage measurements were performed by an Agilent source-meter (model: B2901A) coupled with SMU computer code.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route to obtain CTG functionalized trans-cinnamic acid with alkyl arms is illustrated in Scheme 1. The alkylation of 4-hydroxy benzaldehyde was carried out with alkyl bromides (R–Br) with lower and higher members in the presence of anhydrous K2CO3 using acetone as the solvent.35 The products (A1–A4) were obtained in good yields in the liquid state and the IR study showed the absence of a hydroxyl group. Further, the obtained 4-n-allkoxy benzaldehyde was subjected to a Knoevenagel condensation reaction with malonic acid using a catalytic amount of piperidine in dry pyridine solvent to obtain 4-n-alkoxy trans cinnamic acid (B1–B4) in good yield.36CTV a cyclic trimer of veratrole with a bowl-shaped conformation was synthesized by the acid catalyzed reaction of 3,4-dimethoxy benzene with formaldehyde at room temperature for 3 h.37 The confirmation of the methylene bridge and methoxy group was achieved by 1H and 13C-NMR spectroscopy and the absence of hydroxy group was confirmed by the IR study. The demethylation of CTV was carried out with 36 equivalent of AlCl3 as the dealkylating reagent in dichloromethane to produce selectively demethylated CTG in 65% yield at room temperature.38 The CTG-linked cinnamate trimers (CTGC1–4) were synthesized by the esterification reaction of CTG and 4-n-alkoxy trans cinnamic acid (B1–B4) using N-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC·HCl) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as a catalyst in dichloromethane (DCM).39 The reaction was monitored on TLC plates using a mobile phase consisting of 5% methanol:DCM. After completion of the reaction, pure compounds were obtained by a simple trituration method. Recrystallization of the products was carried out in chloroform to achieve yellowish brown colored crystals. The target compounds, CTG linked cinnamate trimers (CTGC1–CTGC4), were obtained in good yields (73–76%). The crown conformation of the compounds was established using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MALDI-TOF analysis, and IR-spectroscopy (see the ESI† file). Further, the detailed information regarding the synthesis, method and characterization of all intermediates and target materials is provided in the ESI.†

3.2 Polarizing optical microscopy study
The mesomorphic properties of the CTG functionalized trans cinnamate unit with a terminal substituted alkoxy tail group were investigated by using polarizing optical microscopy (POM) upon heating and cooling runs. The obtained phase transitions from crystalline (Cr) to columnar hexagonal (Colh) and Colh to isotropic (I) were studied by the changes in the birefringent pattern of the textures. The optical POM texture images of the synthesized cyclotriguaiacyclene based supramolecular materials are illustrated in Fig. 2. All four symmetrical tri-substituted bowl-shaped CTG based compounds adopted a crown conformation and displayed pseudo-focal conic textures accompanied with four fringes, a common texture pattern obtained for the Colh phase in discotic type liquid crystalline compounds. The POM texture was obtained after cooling down to an isotropic liquid and further to a mesomorphic state after annealing the materials from a solid crystalline to an isotropic state. The observed texture pattern of the columnar phase is further correlated with high temperature XRD results to confirm the molecular arrangement pattern in the mesomorphic state. All the compounds showed a higher temperature range of the mesophase and further stabilized the columnar mesophase up to 24.0 °C in the cooling cycle. The compounds CTGC1, CTGC2, CTGC3 and CTGC4 exhibited first phase transition (Cr to Colh) at 114.0 °C, 107.0 °C, 44.0 °C and 26.0 °C and second phase transition from Colh to I at 176.0 °C, 173.0 °C, 121.0 °C and 108.0 °C upon heating cycle. A similar texture pattern of the columnar mesophase was attained at 108.0 °C, 102.0 °C, 36.0 °C and 24.0 °C in the cooling cycle. It was evident that with an increase in the alkoxy side chain length there was a significant impact on their flexibility. Besides, there was a reduction in the crystallinity of the materials and as a result compound CTGC4 with a tetradecyloxy side group (–OC14H29) displayed liquid crystalline properties with the self-assembly formation at 24.0 °C. Further, all synthesized compounds exhibited enantiotropical type mesogenic properties. The mesophase temperature range of compounds (CTGC1–CTGC4) were 62.0 °C, 66.0 °C, 77.0 °C and 82.0 °C, respectively under heating conditions. It is clearly evident that compounds with a higher alkoxy chain showed a higher mesophase temperature as compared to lower alkoxy substituted compounds. This could be due to the presence of a crown conformation of the centrally substituted CTG core which is stabilized by the higher alkyl chain and also reduces their tendency to crystallize.40 In the columnar type mesophase, the self-assembly formation is mainly due to the strong π–π interactions between the aromatic cores to form columns with a circular cross-section phase in functionalized molecular systems.41 Further, we captured the phase sequence of selected compound CTGC4 with a tetradecyloxy chain (–OC14H29) at different temperatures in the cooling cycle. The phase sequence of compound CTGC4 was captured from the isotropic liquid state to solid state at 24.0 °C (Fig. 3) which showed clear transformation of the isotropic liquid to mesophase at variable temperature which was further confirmed by the DSC study. The phase behavior in heating and cooling cycles showed a descending tendency for both the phase transitions of CTGC4 (Fig. 4). It was also observed that the melting point of the supramolecules varies regularly with the variable alkyl chain length in the terminally substituted alkoxy group (–OR). This may be due to the molecular architecture with different polarizability, polarity and dipole moments those impact the system with the electron cloud.42

All the four cyclotriguaiacyclene linked trans cinnamate materials exhibited two endotherms and exothermic peaks in the second heating and cooling cycles. The reversible thermotropic peaks indicate enantiotropic phase transition properties of the synthesized supramolecular CTG-based compounds. The DSC thermograms of all the four derivatives are shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  DSC scanning curves of compound CTGC1 (a); comp. CTGC2 (b); comp. CTGC3 (c); comp. CTGC4 (d) (scan rate 10 °C min−1). 
The onset values of temperatures associated with the DSC study were in good agreement with the POM results. The synthesized compounds with hexyloxy, octyloxy, decyloxy and tetradecyloxy side chains exhibited a first transition peak of the solid to columnar mesophase at 118.5 °C, 110.7 °C, 49.63 °C and 32.82 °C on heating and at 113.1 °C, 109.8 °C, 38.91 °C and 29.54 °C in the cooling run. The second endothermic peaks related to the columnar phase to isotropic liquid were detected at 180.8 °C, 176.2 °C, 116.7 °C and 103.6 °C on heating and at 173.2 °C, 169.3 °C, 114.3 °C and 101.3 °C in the cooling cycle. The observed sharp DSC peaks indicated the good thermal behavior of synthesized supramolecular compounds. It can be observed that the mesogenic temperatures decreased with the higher flexible alkoxy chain. The greater flexibility can have an impact on the molecular rigidity, polarizability, and other molecular interactions.37 The bar graph clearly shows the phase behavior of the synthesized CTG-based compounds with a flexible alkyl chain (Fig. 6). The bar graph showing the stability of the mesophase to isotropic phase transition is higher as compared to the solid to mesophase phase transition, respectively. Additionally, the compounds showed thermally stable room temperature liquid crystalline properties. Further, the thermal stability of the materials was also investigated by TGA analysis. It can be observed that the stable crown conformation of CTG as the central core is responsible for the higher thermal stability of the compounds. Additionally, the tri-substituted linking unit with an alkyl arm holds the molecules in a more ordered type as compared to normal supramolecular materials. On other hand, all the four materials showed a broad temperature range of mesophase due to the presence of the highly stable cinnamate linking group in addition to the alkyl chain on the tri substituted CTG core. This further enhanced the stability of the molecules those are stacked in layers and side-by-side configurations and reduced the crystalline nature of the compounds with stabilization of the mesophase at lower temperature.
 Fig. 6  Bar graphs representing the thermal behavior of the compounds (CTGC1–CTGC4) in the heating cycle (a) and the cooling cycle (b). 
The TGA data of the synthesized compounds are presented in Fig. 7. The thermal stability of the supramesogens (CTGC1–CTGC4) was investigated within the temperature range of 50 to 500 °C. All four supramesogens showed single-stage type thermal decomposition behavior. The compounds with a higher alkoxy tail showed lower thermal stability as compared to lower alkoxy tail scaffolds. From the TGA curves, it was observed that the compounds, CTGC3 and CTGC4 with decyloxy (–OC10H21) and tetradecyloxy (–OC14H29) tail groups displayed a minimum weight loss of nearly 20% and 17%, respectively at 313–403 °C (Tmax = 334 °C). However, the other remaining residues were completely decomposed close to 500 °C. The compounds, CTGC1 and CTGC2 with hexyloxy (–OC6H13) and octyloxy (–OC8H17) tail groups showed 24% and 19% weight loss, respectively between 310 and 375 °C with complete degradation at around 500 °C. The decomposition of the compounds may be owing to the cleavage of vinyl-ester groups with substituted alkoxy side arms.42 These results suggest that the substitution of a higher alkoxy side chain leads to a lower weight loss as compared to lower chain substituted compounds. Importantly, the higher thermal stability of the compound is mainly dependent on the properties and stability of the functionalized central core having conjugation and stable conformation.

3.4 XRD analysis
The presence of the columnar mesophase as evident from POM and DSC analysis was further confirmed using small and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) experiments to determine the molecular arrangement pattern in the mesogenic state. The analysis was performed at the mesogenic transition temperatures obtained from DSC and POM investigation. The XRD patterns of all the derivatives (CTGC1–CTGC4) are embraced in Fig. 8. The diffraction patterns of the two supramolecular compounds with a lower alkoxy chain showed three reflections in the low region while the other two diffused signals appeared in the higher angle region. This clearly indicates the presence of the liquid-like order of the aliphatic alkyl chain and π–π stacking behavior of the central CTG core linked trans cinnamate substituted derivatives. The SAXS/WAXS pattern of compound CTGC1 with a hexyloxy tail group at a temperature of 108.0 °C showed three peaks at 4.3°, 5.6° and 6.2° in the small angle region, and the corresponding d-spacing values were 20.54 Å, 15.78 Å and 14.27 Å. Likewise, for CTGC2 with an octyloxy tail group the peaks appeared at 3.5°, 5.2° and 6.6° with d-spacing values of 25.22 Å, 16.40 Å and 13.39 Å. The ratio of the observed reflections was found to be 1:1/:1/, which suggests the presence of the [100], [110] and [200] planes in the hexagonal lattice. CTGC3 with a decyloxy tail group displayed three diffraction patterns at 3.3°, 5.1° and 6.4° and the calculated d-spacings were 26.96 Å, 17.34 Å and 13.82 Å. In CTGC4 with a tetra decyloxy tail group, the observed diffraction patterns were at 2.7°, 4.9° and 5.8° and the calculated d-spacing values were 32.69 Å, 18.03 Å and 15.23 Å, respectively. Further, the diffraction peaks in the broad angle region were at 22.6° and 23.7° for CTGC1, 22.5°and 24.5° for CTGC2, 22.1° and 23.9° for CTGC3, and 22.4° and 23.6° for compound CTGC4. The d-spacing values for the first broad halo (ha) peaks found were 4.01 Å, 4.02 Å, 4.09 Å and 4.04 Å which confirm the molecular arrangement with respect to the central rigid core unit while the d-spacing values corresponding to the other weak peaks (hc) were 3.83 Å, 3.71 Å, 3.80 Å and 3.84 Å, respectively for CTGC1–CTGC4. The presence of one broad peak (ha) and one weak peak (hc) in all four supramolecular compounds is mainly due to the presence of π–π stacking behavior in the self-assembly formation with core–core interactions of CTG-functionalized vinyl-ester linked arms.43 Additionally, the CTG–core stabilized columnar mesophase was enhanced due to functionalization with polar conducting arms which further hold the column matrix.44
 Fig. 8  X-ray diffraction patterns of compound CTGC1 at 108.0 °C (a); compound CTGC2 at 102.0 °C (b); compound CTGC3 at 36.0 °C (c); compound CTGC4 at 30.0 °C (d); the inset pictures show ball-sticking models of the corresponding target CTG based compounds. 
Reported studies so far have also demonstrated similar diffraction patterns with self-assembled supramolecular LCs having a columnar type molecular arrangement.45–47 The estimated molecular length of the target mesogens (CTGC1–CTGC4) were found to be 21.03 Å, 24.55 Å, 27.08 Å and 32.17 Å, respectively, which is close to the molecular length of the symmetrical tri-substituted crown conformation adopted target supramolecular systems. Hence, the obtained d-spacing values at small angle region were closely fitted to the hexagonal lattice. The systematic representation of the molecular arrangement in the columnar hexagonal phase of CTGC1 is shown in Fig. 9. The equatorial reflections indicate the two-dimensional positional order of the respective column which is further assigned to a hexagonal columnar type of pattern. Thus, such supramolecular liquid crystalline compounds with a stabilized columnar mesophase at room temperature and high thermal stability can serve as important materials for the applied target domain asssociated to the device which could cater current and future energy need of the society.

3.5 Thin film study for photovoltaics

3.5.1 Thin film deposition. 
The compound with a decyloxy tail (CTGC3) was selected to seek applicability as optical window and constituent layers in second and third generation solar-cell devices due to its room temperature mesogenic properties and for providing a large number of intermolecular forces with charge carrier mobility. The thin films of CTGC3 were deposited by using spin coating method at 3000 rpm for 5 min on glass and indium doped tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates followed by ex situ drop casting recipe where solution is preaded over the target substrates by drops using a medical syringe and then desiccation at room temperature till drying. Prior undertaking coats of the thin films, the ITO and glass substrates were cleaned with acetone and isopropyl alcohol to minimize contamination and to remove other impurities present on the substrate surface. After the deposition of the thin films, the as-deposited/pristine thin films were annealed in air ambient at temperature 100 °C and 200 °C in muffle furnace. The samples are optimized by subjecting these to the optical and electrical analysis tools. The proposed architecture of the supramolecular liquid crystal (CTGC3) layer based device is shown in Fig. 10 where optimized layers could be employed while other constituent layers need to be optimized in accordance with the device architecture. Such thin films can be employed as optical window in CdTe based solar cell devices to augment perfornace together with environment aspects as the prevalent CdS optical window material is a known toxic compound while one needs to ensure required properties in analogy to the champion CdS layer.8,48 There are some reports in the literature where supramolecular LCs are used in various solar cell devices to acquire higher efficiency. Levitsky et al. reported a solar cell based on n-type nanoporous Si (PSi) filled with copper Pc (CuPc).49 The developed solar cell device revealed a power conversion efficiency up to 2%. Fujii et al. studied various Pc DLCs in PVs. They primed an OPV device based on the Pc derivative 1,4,8,11,15,18,22,25-octahexylphthalocyanine (C6PcH2) as a donor and the fullerene derivative PC61BM as an acceptor.50 The achieved power conversion efficiency was up to 3.1%. Also, Jurow et al. reported several thioalkyl-substituted Pc derivatives and observed that a number of thioalkyl-substituents estimated between 3 and 10 where some of these mixtures were found to be discotic liquid crystalline materials.51 The solar cells developed from these DLC materials revealed a power conversion efficiency between 0.06% and 0.15%.

3.5.2 Optical study. 
Several liquid crystalline compounds have been reported with a wide range of properties like thermal stability, mobility, and charge-transport ratio, and other anisotropic properties, however, they do not demonstrate applicability in solar cells.52 Thus, our aim was to measure the physical properties of the synthesized CTG-linked cinnamate derivatives those are relevant to solar cell applications such as desired optical absorbance and transmittance together with effectual electrical properties. In the present investigation, we have selected a cinnamate linking unit with vinyl and ester groups to achieve the desired stability along with the optical properties of the target CTG-linked materials having mesomorphic properties. The absorbance and transmittance are measured in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm followed by undertaking extinction coefficient. Fig. 11 presents the absorbance and transmittance spectra of as-deposited and annealed thin films of the selected compound CTGC3. The absorption spectra showed a rapid decrease in absorbance till 500 nm and then remain almost constant. Typically, the right edge of the spectra could be red-shifted, which may be due to the size effect which impacts the spin–orbit coupling and restrains the excitation positions46 but, it is not visible herein. The substituted trans form of cinnamic acid could show a slight blue shift with an intense behavior due to its flat conformation, which may get slightly altered as compared to the cis form of cinnamic acid. It could also show to a red shift when it is linked with alkyl arms on the three sides of the central core while as stated the edge is not visible. The presence of red-shift together with higher absorption in both the UV and visible regions is one of the most key factors for the fabrication of solar cells53 which is needed to be done in due course. There was a slight increase in the absorption spectra of the CTG-based thin film annealed at 100 °C and on further heating demonstrating a decreasing tendency where the 200 °C annealed films showed lower absorbance demonstrating their aplicability as constituent layer with the absorber. The synthesized compounds display good electronic nature with the presence of an electron donor and acceptor site, besides π-electron cloud is responsible for reactivity of the supramolecular materials. Additionally, it can also be correlated with the absorption of light at a definite wavelength with a number of different types of light absorbed units.53 Importantly, the optical absorbance of organic based pristine and lower temperature annealed materials could be higher as compared to the inorganic materials, which was also observed in the present work.54
 Fig. 11  (a) Absorbance and (b) transmittance spectra of the as-deposited and air annealed supramesogen (CTGC3) based thin films. 
The extinction coefficients of the selected compound, CTGC3 based thin film, is illustrated in Fig. 12. Furthermore, for the pristine and lower temperature annealed films, the spectra show a descending tendency up to 550 nm and then show a gradual increasing trend in the higher visible region while as visible, 200 °C annealed samples demonstrating varied extinction coefficient in analogy with the absorbance spectra but wavelength multiplier augment it. This could also be ascribed to the roughness of the surface and some pores in the prepared thin films as revealed by the literature.54 As stated, the extinction coefficient of the pristine and lower annealing temperature processed thin films is found higher and further decreased at 200 °C which may be attributed to attaining an isotropic state. These results suggest that the pristine and 100 °C processed supramolecular liquid crystal based films could be useful for a specific target applied domain where higher absorbance is required and annealing at 100 °C may be performed for diffusion and stability aspects. Herein, the target is applicability as optical window and trasnport layer to the devices and thus, 200 °C annealed samples are desired.
 Fig. 12  Behaviour of the optical extinction coefficient with the wavelength for the as-deposited and air annealed supramesogen (CTGC3) based thin films. 
The optical transmittance curves appear to rise with an increase in the wavelength. The thin film annealed at 200 °C displayed higher transmittance of more than 90% and lower for the as-deposited and 100 °C annealed films. This observed behavior in transmittance could be due to the relative change in the crystal growth of the thin films. The band gap of the prepared supramolecular (CTGC3) based thin film was measured by applying an empirical Tauc plots method of the selected materials with a decyloxy tail and room temperature mesogenic properties which are shown in Fig. 13. The optical band gap analyzed using the Tauc plots was found to be 2.93 eV, 2.87 eV and 3.45 eV for the as-deposited and annealed thin films at 100 °C and 200 °C, respectively. The synthesized CTG based materials could show good electrical behavior due to the presence of active sites on the molecular system which is briefly discussed in the following section. Additionally, the annealing also impacts the optical energy band gap as evident from the blue shift due to annealing.55 On the other hand, the increasing alkyl chain on the terminal end towards the molecular systems may also impact the energy band gap which could be further affected by the active sites of the central CTG rigid core. However, the increased energy band gap with annealing and the thermal stability of the supramolecular compounds with a stable conformation are more likely to fulfill the need for the target applied domain to implicate as optical window or constituent layer material. Thus, the prepared supramolecular compounds with a stable columnar hexagonal mesophase and having a wide optical band gap can serve potential to implicate in solar cells as optical window and transport layers, in analogy with toxic metal salts of inorganic materials together with environment aspects.

3.5.3 Electrical study. 
The transverse current–voltage (I–V) characteristic curves for the as-deposited and annealed CTGC thin films are depicted in Fig. 14. The variation in current with voltage for the CTGC thin films is found to follow the ohmic trend except 200 °C annealed films which need further material and interface engineering to ensure ohmic nature. For both the pristine and 100 °C annealed films, the characteristics show a linear dependence of current with voltage in both the forward and reverse directions, which confirms the ohmic behavior of contact between the film surface and underlying ITO layer. For 200 °C annealed films, the current decreases, which implicates the decrease in conductivity of the CTGC films. However, there was an explicit increase in the conductivity of the CTGC film annealed at 100 °C. This observed increment may be due to the enhancement in crystal size and reduced crystal defects while the contamination during the annealing process might lead to a reduction in conductivity.56 Nevertheless, the optical and electrical properties of the optimized supramolecular CTGC3 are explored while as stated, at the time of device development, one needs to ensure ohmic behavior of the optimized films together with optimization of other counterparts of the proposed device in accordance with the architecture.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized tri-substituted CTG based supramolecular liquid crystals (CTGC1–CTGC4) by functionalizing a CTG core with three side substitution of a trans cinnamic linker embedded with an ester group and alkoxy arms. All the four CTG-linked cinnamate compounds exhibited an enantiotropic columnar mesophase with good thermal stability. The materials with higher alkoxy chain length (–OC10H21 & –OC14H29) stabilized the mesophase up to 32.0 and 24.0 °C. The synthesized compounds showed a higher temperature range of the mesophase with a low crystallization tendency at lower temperature. This work illustrates formation of a stable crown conformation by functionalizing a CTG core to obtain columnar liquid crystalline compounds with important features like thermal stability and optical properties, making them suitable candidate as optical window and transport layer for solar cell applications. Further, the CTGC3 based thin film demonstrates ohmic type behavior and efficient electrical conductivity except 200 °C annealed films which further needs material and interface engineering. The optical energy band gap suggests applicability of CTG based liquid crystal thin films. The current findings warrant that CTGC3 based thin films annealed at 200 °C have higher transmittance and energy band gap, and thus may serve as a suitable alternative to replace the champion CdS optical window material in second generation solar cell devices while its electrical properties still needs interface engineering those should be in analogy with the prevalent material and the other constituent layers would be optimized in accordance with the device architecture as per need of the currect era of cutting edge technology.

Design, System, Application
Recent developments in liquid crystals with columnar self-assembly have permitted the development of functional supramolecular materials with self-assembly nature which are potentially active in the energy and electro-optic fields. Molecular engineering of these CTG-linked trans cinnamate based compounds are enabled to exhibit room temperature liquid crystalline properties with higher thermal stability. We have demonstrated CTG based molecular design and engineering to construct columnar mesogens and could be successfully applied as window layer for solar cell applications. The supramesogens based on a CTG core can serve as potential alternative candidates to implicate as optical window in second generation and transport layer in third generation solar cell devices while other constituent layers would need individual optimization to ensure desired performance.
