, Accepted 9th October 2015First published on 16th October 2015AbstractIn order to prevent the metal-sulfide film from falling off a substrate during in situ preparation, a solvent-free element-direct reaction was developed. To exploit this new strategy, lead sulfide (PbS) film was selected to grow on Indium-Tin-Oxide-coated glass (ITO/glass) at 150 °C. The prepared PbS film exhibited outstanding adhesion on the substrate according to the tape test results. The analyses of X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated the PbS film possessed good crystallinity and nearly balanced stoichiometry. In addition, the prepared PbS film exhibited intensive blue-shifted interband absorption. Moreover, photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements illustrated that it possessed great photosensitivity and n-type conductivity. Other important properties such as crystal structure, film thickness, current–voltage (I–V) characteristics, surface roughness and topography were studied in detail.
1. Introduction
Metal sulfides are widely exploited for their novel semiconductor properties such as photosensitivity1 and quantum confinement effect.2 Among these metal sulfides, lead sulfide (PbS), especially in the form of film, has attracted considerable attention for application in solar cells,3 infrared detectors,4 gas sensors5 and so on. To date, lots of methods, including chemical bath deposition (CBD),6 chemical vapor deposition (CVD)7 and thermal evaporation8 driven by the reaction in the liquid, vapor–liquid–solid or vapor–solid states respectively, have been developed to synthesize metal-sulfide films. Although these methods are useful and are of widespread importance, intrinsic deficiencies still exist, limiting their utilization for scaling up applications. For example, some methods require expensive equipment, relatively high temperature, or significant energy input, and others use toxic metal organic compounds or toxic reagents like H2S. In order to integrate them with device fabrication, considerable effort has been made to develop a convenient, low-cost and effective way to synthesis them on a large scale.
One of the most straightforward ways to synthesize metal sulfides is the direct combination of sulfur and metal at a high temperature. With traditional element-direct reaction, it is easy to prepare metal sulfides in the form of powder, but it is hard to obtain the form of film. Moreover, the high reaction temperature often leads the product to agglomerate more easily or exhibit relatively large grain size. Thus, it is desired to explore new synthesis strategies with low temperature, easy operation and high efficiency to generate metal sulfides in the form of film by an economic way. In recent years, our group has developed an element-direct solvothermal method to in situ synthesize films of binary PbS,9 CdSe,10 In2S3,11 Ag2S,12 CuS,13 Ag2Se,14 ternary ZnIn2S415 and quaternary Cu2ZnSnS416 at large scale with oriented, uniform, ordered and unique surface microstructure. Briefly, the reaction only needs bulk element S or selenium (Se) powder, a metal foil or metal film on any substrate, and a common solvent like ethanol or ethylenediamine. No other compound or chemical additive is required. Besides, in situ preparation can make a film directly and stably root in or grow on a substrate. Therefore, it can be used to simplify synthesis steps, facilitate device fabrication or improve device performance. Furthermore, the strategy is very suitable for in situ synthesis of metal-sulfide film on its corresponding metal foil. For example, perfect peony-like PbS film can be in situ grown on flexible Pb foil by only employing ethylenediamine as solvent.9
However, the PbS film produced by element-direct solvothermal process is substrate selective, which will fall off if we use a substrate with Pb film deposited on Indium-Tin-Oxide-coated glass (ITO/glass) instead of Pb foil. Besides, solvothermal methods will result in some surface impurities due to the absorbed solvent on film surface. Furthermore, organic solvent is usually harmful to the environment and not appropriate for use on a large scale.
In this paper, we will introduce a solvent-free direct-element reaction to in situ grow PbS film on ITO/glass, on which Pb film was sputtered as precursor. In addition, ITO/glass is widely used as the transparent substrate in semiconductor devices. As a proof of concept, the reaction was done with a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave as a reactor at a low reaction temperature of 150 °C. As comparison, this new strategy is more simplified and energy-efficiency than the reported two-step process about the sulphurization of metallic precursors, which usually employs sophisticated control systems, high temperature or vacuum condition.17–19 In this work, the PbS film prepared by our newly developed method exhibited outstanding optical switch performance and excellent response at short wavelength infra-red (SWIR) spectrum range within PEC cell.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
All reagents, ammonia (NH3·H2O), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), were of analytical grade. The reactants were high-purity Pb target (99.99%) and sublimated sulfur (≥99.5%). ITO/glass, with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1, was cut into 10 × 20 mm2 and used as substrate.
2.2 Cleaning of ITO/glass
A high quality substrate is very important to ensure good adhesion of the deposited film in the following processes. Thus, rigorous solution-based cleaning steps were taken to clean the ITO/glass. Firstly, the substrates were ultrasonically washed in an aqueous detergent for 30 min to remove the grease and dust. After ultrasonically rinsing with deionized (DI) water for 10 min three times, they were boiled in a mixed solution of NH3·H2O, H2O2 and DI water with a volume ratio of 1:2:5 at 80 °C until no bubbles generating, indicating all organic residue were removed from the surface. At the end, they were ultrasonically rinsed again in DI water for 10 min three times, and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 2 h.
2.3 Sputtering of Pb film on ITO/glass
After installing Pb target, clean substrates were put on the holder of table sputter coater with ITO sides facing up (K575XD, Emitech). Then, the top area of each ITO film was covered by glass slide for protection (transparent part in Fig. 1a), leaving ITO as an electrode to connect with external circuit. The sputter coater was closed and the sputtering current was set as 60 mA. Film thickness of 200 nm was controlled precisely by using monitor option, which is the thickness usually applied in PbS film based photoelectronic devices.20,21 The chamber was pumped down to 1.0 × 10−3 mbar vacuum at ambient temperature to start the process of sputtering. Finally, black and mirror-like Pb film as thick as 200 nm was achieved on ITO/glass under Ar atmosphere (Fig. 1a).

2.4 In situ synthesis of PbS films
A square Teflon groove (1 × 1 cm2) filled with 0.04 g sublimated sulphur was put in a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave laid flat in an oven. The sulphur residue left at the end of the reaction indicated the excess amount of sulphur powder was used in the reaction. To avoid evaporated sulphur being deposited on the glass surface, the Pb/ITO/glass was covered with glass slides on both sides except the part of Pb film, and supported with brackets. Then, it was also put into the same Teflon-lined autoclave with Pb film facing downward, but not directly toward the sulphur-powder filled square groove. It was fixed at a height of 1 cm and kept a distance from the square groove to inhibit evaporated sulphur from absorbing on the surface of Pb film directly to prevent vapor–solid reaction (Fig. 1b).
In order to find the optimum temperature to trigger the reaction of sulphur powder, the Teflon-lined autoclave was sealed and heated at 80 °C, 100 °C, 120 °C and 150 °C, respectively. We found that the sulphur powder hardly changed when the temperature was lower than 120 °C, due to low saturated vapor pressure of sulphur according to its phase diagram. High saturated vapor pressure will accelerate the evaporation of sulphur and promote the element-direct reaction. From the phase diagram, saturated vapor pressure of sulphur will increase greatly with temperature above 120 °C. Besides, the maximum temperature that the Teflon-lined autoclave can bear is 180 °C. In addition, low reaction temperature is often desired for substrate that can't resist high temperature. Therefore, 150 °C, which is between 120 °C and 180 °C, was chosen as the reaction temperature.
As for the reaction duration, less than 2 h was confirmed to be too short to convert Pb film into PbS with a thickness of 200 nm according to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results. Subsequently, the reaction was prolonged from 2 h to 5 h, 8 h, 10 h and 20 h step by step. XRD analysis indicated the duration of 5 h was long enough to finish the transformation from Pb film into PbS, while the film crystallinity was further improved by extending the reaction to 8 h and 10 h successively. However, further increasing the reaction duration to 20 h didn't have obvious improvement of film crystallinity. Thus, in order to get the PbS film with good crystallinity in an energy-efficient way, 10 h was chosen for the reaction duration.
Finally, the Teflon-lined autoclave was sealed and heated at 150 °C for 10 h, followed by purging nitrogen (N2) gas to replace air in it. As soon as the reaction finished, the product of PbS/ITO/glass was taken out of the Teflon-lined autoclave immediately without cooling to protect the obtained PbS film from being deposited by cooled sulphur vapor. As a consequence, the obtained dark-grey PbS film exhibited mirror-like surface.
2.5 Tape test
To establish the adhesion of PbS film to the substrate, tape test was carried out with a transparent tape as wide as 19 mm (Scotch, 3 M 600). Two complete laps of the tape were removed from the roll and discard to insure the cleanness of the tape. Then, an additional length was removed at a steady rate to avoid any damage on tape properties and a piece of tape as long as ∼50 mm was cut for the following test.
PbS film was blown by cool air as soon as it was taken out of Teflon-lined autoclave to make sure it was dry and clean before tape test. The center of the tape was placed at the center of PbS film with the tape running in all directions as the smaller angles. Smooth the tape by finger and rub firmly with the eraser. Within ∼120 s of application, the tape was removed by seizing the free end and pulled off rapidly back upon itself at an angle as close to 180° as possible. These steps were repeated for three times. According to the inspection, there wasn't any obvious substance glued on the tape which indicated the PbS film exhibited outstanding adhesion on the substrate.
2.6 Characterization
XRD patterns were detected on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.54178 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA) over the 2θ range of 20°–60° with a step size of 0.02°. In order to confirm chemical composition of the PbS film, both energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, genesis 2000, EDAX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were studied. The excited voltage was 4 keV for EDX measurement, and analytical grade PbS powder was tested firstly to calibrate standardless light-element coefficient (SEC). The XPS was performed on a Kratos Axis Ultra spectrometer with monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) as the exciting source. The C 1s peak located at 284.6 eV was used as the reference to calibrate the spectra, and survey spectrum was scanned within an area of 300 μm–700 μm. Film thickness and surface morphology were revealed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, S-4800, HITACHI), in which secondary electrons were employed for imaging. Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Dimension 3100, Veeco) was employed to investigate surface roughness and current–voltage (I–V) characteristic. The standard cantilever with nominal spring constant of ∼40 N m−1 was used for image scanning at tapping mode and conductive cantilever was used for I–V curve measurement. Optical absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Varian) by using a piece of blank ITO/glass as the control sample at room temperature.
2.7 PEC measurement
PEC analysis was performed using a potentiostatic and three-electrode quartz cell. PbS film coated ITO/glass, 10 × 10 mm2 active area, was used as the working electrode, while Pt wire acted as counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference (Fig. 2). The working electrode was placed in the electrolyte of aqueous Na2SO4 (0.10 M) without any sacrificial reagent, and front illumination was used with the conductive side oriented facing the incident light. Light source was a xenon lamp with a power of 300 W, the output of which was chopped by an automatic mechanical shutter with an interval of 10 s. An 800–2200 nm wavelength filter was used to obtain the light within SWIR spectrum range. The changing of transient photocurrent density with time was recorded by an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, CH Instrument Company, China).

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structure and crystallinity
XRD analysis (Fig. 3) indicated the Pb film has been completely transferred into PbS film by this newly developed solvent-free element-direct reaction, and the prepared PbS film exhibited cubic structure and good crystallinity.
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of (a) Pb film on ITO/glass, (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) of the product obtained after the reaction lasted for 0.5 h, 2 h, 5 h, 8 h, 10 h and 20 h respectively, and (h) blank ITO/glass. The standard PDF card (No. 5-592) is put under curve 3d, and diffraction peaks coming from ITO (*), Pb (■) and PbS (▼) are labeled. 
For the precursor (Fig. 3a), the diffraction peaks from both Pb and ITO films were observed. After reaction was run at 150 °C for 0.5 h, diffraction pattern (Fig. 3b) of the product barely changed comparing with that of its precursor, which indicated element Pb and S reacted hardly, because sulphur evaporation also requires time to take part in the element-direct reaction. Further increasing the reaction time to 2 h (Fig. 3c), the diffraction peaks from PbS appeared, however, the peak from the precursor can also been identified at 31.6° (labeled by square upon curve 3c), indicating the Pb was not fully converted into PbS. When the reaction duration was prolonged to 5 h, we found that the peaks from prepared film (Fig. 3d) were only attributed to PbS and ITO, referring to standard PDF card No. 5-592 and the pattern of blank ITO/glass (Fig. 3h). No other peaks were detected except the ones from PbS and ITO, which indicated that the Pb film was completely transformed into PbS film. Furthermore, the peaks from PbS and ITO overlapped at 30.1°, and the PbS film was polycrystalline essentially with a pure cubic structure. In addition, the peak positions hardly shifted as compared to the standard PDF card No. 5-592, which illustrated that the defect caused by strain within PbS films can be ignored. The lattice constant was calculated based on (111) peak, which matched well with the value of standard bulk PbS (a = 5.9362 Å). Further extending the reaction duration to 8 h (Fig. 3e), 10 h (Fig. 3f) and 20 h (Fig. 3g), the diffraction pattern kept the same, while the relative intensity (R) of peak at 25.9° to the main peak at 30.1° increased at different degree. R5 h, R8 h, R10 h and R20 h were calculated to be 0.33, 0.40, 0.52 and 0.53 respectively, which indicated the crystallinity of prepared PbS film was improved stage by stage through extending the reaction duration, while strong and sharp diffraction peaks within curve 3f and 3g demonstrate that PbS film exhibits good crystallinity.
3.2 Chemical compositions
Both EDX and XPS spectra illustrated the PbS film prepared by this newly developed solvent-free element-direct reaction possessed nearly balanced stoichiometry.
As shown in EDX spectrum (Fig. 4), the peaks from element Pb, S, carbon (C) and oxygen (O) are observed without any other peak. The presence of C and O is supposed to be caused by adsorbed gaseous molecules due to the high surface-to-volume ratio of PbS film with many grains on film surface as shown in the following FE-SEM images. Quantitative calculation for atomic ratio of Pb to S gave a result of ∼1.03:1, which was near-stoichiometry with element Pb slightly rich in the film. This result gave better stoichiometry as compared with some reported results.22–24

To further confirm the stoichiometry of PbS film, XPS, as a highly sensitive characterization technique, was preformed to detect all elements except hydrogen (H) and helium (He). As displayed in Fig. 5, the survey spectrum illustrates the presence of Pb, S, C and O without any other element from impurities, and all observed binding-energy values were indexed on the handbook of elements and native oxides (1999 XPS International, Inc.).25 In addition, the high-resolution XPS for C 1s indicated the element C came from the chemical bonds of C–C, C–H, C–OH, C–O–C and O–CO (inset in Fig. 5). Since no organic reagent was used during the whole synthesis process, it further proves our above statement that the C as well as O peaks is believed to be from the adsorbed gaseous molecules or dust because of the exposure to atmosphere. Based on the peak areas of Pb 4f and S 2p, molar ratio of Pb to S was calculated to be 1.05:1, which also satisfied the stoichiometry requirement within experimental uncertain limits, although element Pb was a little bit rich on film surface.

3.3 Surface morphology and film thickness
The precursor was prepared by sputtering, resulting in Pb grains uniformly distributed on the surface with gaps between them, and a compact Pb layer closer to the substrate (Fig. 6a and b). During the in situ element-direct reaction, more Pb content within the grains will promote PbS growing faster to generate over-grown grains which also dispersed uniformly on the surface. Correspondingly, the compact underlying Pb layer transferred to the dense and compact PbS film on the substrate (Fig. 6e).
 Fig. 6  FE-SEM images of (a–c) for Pb film, and (d–f) for PbS film at different magnifications; (c and f) are cross-section views. Insets: Pb grain in (b), two over-grown PbS grains in (d) and PbS grain from underlying lay in (e). 
As revealed by FE-SEM images, the surface of Pb film is composed of ∼500 nm grains with barely over-grown grains and they distribute orderly over the entire surface shown in Fig. 6a. Furthermore, gap exists distinguishably between different grains (Fig. 6b), and every grain is consisted of cuboid-like particles with the size of ∼20 × 20 × 50 nm3 (inset in Fig. 6b). From cross-section view (Fig. 6c), the thickness of Pb film was identified to be ∼200 nm as expected.
After solvent-free element-direct reaction, Pb film was completely transformed into PbS film, with many over-grown grains evenly dispersed over the entire surface (Fig. 6d). The grains exhibited a diameter of ∼1.5 μm, and each grain was constructed by ∼300 nm particles (insert in Fig. 6d). As for the underlying compact film (Fig. 6e), many angular grains with four crystal planes were grown on the surface (insert in Fig. 6e). Film thickness was identified to be ∼200 nm as shown in the cross-section view (Fig. 6f), which roughly kept the thickness of its precursor. In addition, the height of over-grown grains can also be estimated to be ∼800 nm.
Noted that, over-grown grains were usually observed on film surface, and they often possessed arbitrary shapes, sizes and distribution.23,26,27 Whereas, the over-grown grains with regular morphology and size were uniformly grown on PbS film surface, which formed a kind of three-dimensional (3D) surface structure. In addition, much effort has been made to synthesize the film with unique microstructure on its surface, which will construct 3D surface instead of traditional planar one. The 3D surface with unique microstructure will make the film exhibit some potentially new phenomena to exploit the distinctive optical or electronic property.28–30 The evenly distributed PbS grains could increase the surface area and help with providing better photoelectrical performance. The plausible part is that such phenomenon is repeatable and following PEC measurement confirmed that our PbS film has shown great photocurrent response to the light within the whole spectrum, especially in the range of SWTR spectrum.
3.4 Surface topography and roughness
According to the characterization of AFM micrograph for PbS film without over-grown grains (Fig. 7), some especially small particles existing between different grains on film surface were identified, which caused a blue-shift interband absorption within PbS film. In addition, the average roughness (Ra) was approximately reduced to be the half of that presented by Pb film and comparable to the reported results of other PbS films.27,31
 Fig. 7  (a) 2D AFM, (b) sectional, and (c) 3D AFM images for Pb film, and (d) 2D AFM, (e) sectional, and (f) 3D AFM images for PbS film. 
Based on the two-dimensional (2D) AFM micrograph in Fig. 7a, grains, obvious gaps, and grain composed of particles are observed on the surface of Pb film. In addition, the grain size is measured to be ∼500 nm from sectional image as shown in Fig. 7b, similar to the estimation from FE-SEM image. 3D AFM image exhibits surface topography (Fig. 7c), a visualized surface roughness. The roughness was quantified by the Ra, which was ∼55.2 nm for the Pb film.
2D AFM image for the compact PbS film (Fig. 7d) displays a granular morphology with not only ∼200 nm grains, but also some especially small particles existing between different grains which can be further confirmed by the sectional image (Fig. 7e) based on above FE-SEM images. The existence of these small particles is supposed to be the reason to cause a blue-shift interband absorption within PbS film. Moreover, the Ra was ∼29.1 nm according to 3D AFM micrograph (Fig. 7f).
3.5 Optical absorption
Energy-level structure was studied by optical absorption (Fig. 8). Because PbS has a large exciton Bohr radius (18 nm) at room temperature, some small particles growing on PbS film, exhibited a similar absorption feature with that of ∼10 nm PbS quantum dots.6,32–34
 Fig. 8  Absorption spectrum for PbS film. Inset: FE-SEM image of PbS film. 
The dark-grey PbS film displays a absorption band between 1.3 eV and 3.2 eV primarily from the intrinsic absorption of bulk PbS, which indicates electrons can be excited from valence band to conduction band, and it should start from the band-gap energy of PbS at ∼0.41 eV at room temperature. Whereas, a different peak appeared at ∼0.7 eV, which is supposed to originate from a blue-shift interband absorption within PbS for quantum confinement effect.
3.6 I–V characterization
A heterojunction was formed for the PbS film prepared in situ on ITO/glass. I–V characteristics is significant to reveal the performance of both the film and devices based on this kind of heterojunction. I–V curves were measured at room temperature in dark with applied voltage from −1 V to +1 V (Fig. 9). As introduced in the Experimental section, the PbS film was unintentionally doped and showed an n-type conductivity, discussed in the following section of transient photocurrent response. Correspondingly, the electrical analysis based on the obtained I–V curves indicated the newly formed heterojunction exhibited rectification characteristics. Similar phenomenon is also reported in other kind of heterojunctions, like ITO/Si,35 CuS nanotubes–ITO,36 InN nanorods/Si37 and so on.26,38
 Fig. 9  I–V curve for PbS film. 
As shown in Fig. 9, the I–V curve was non-linear and asymmetric due to the rectifying behavior of the heterojunction formed at the interfaces of PbS film and ITO. The current increased under forward bias and blocked between 0 and −0.6 V under reverse bias. According to the electrical theory of semiconductor junction, the charge carriers will recombine at the junction and create a depletion region. Under forward bias, the I–V dependence of the PbS/ITO heterojunction displayed an exponential rise at a low voltage range (0 V–0.6 V), with a turn on voltage of ∼0.3 V, because of the decreasing in the width of depletion layer at the interface. Moreover, the I–V relationship is almost linear at a relatively high voltage range (0.6 V–1.0 V) due to the minimized depletion layer at the junction. Under reverse bias, the depletion layer increased for the introduction of high barrier potential and resulted in a fairly small current in the junction until the reverse bias increased to the breakdown voltage of ∼−0.6 V. As for the rapid increment in the reverse current at high reverse voltage, it was most likely caused by the leakage current arising from the surface layer.
3.7 Transient photocurrent response
Current investigation about photocurrent response (Fig. 10) indicated the newly prepared PbS film exhibited n-type conduction and excellent photosensitivity within the whole spectrum range, especially in SWIR spectrum range (800–2200 nm) which will make the PbS more useful to be applied in infrared devices, and this point was also supported by chemically deposited PbS film.34 In addition, low dark current guarantees the outstanding optical switch performance of the PEC cell.
 Fig. 10  Transient photocurrent response of PbS film excited by the light within the whole (a) and SWIR (b) spectrum ranges, respectively. 
Transient photocurrent response was characterized by transient photocurrent–time behavior by using a PEC system under intermittent irradiation of the light within the whole (Fig. 10a) or SWIR (Fig. 10b) spectrum ranges at 0 V bias vs. SCE, photocurrent appeared and went up to the maximum immediately, but it disappeared once the irradiation was switched off. The phenomenon is the characteristic of anodic photocurrent, suggesting the PbS film exhibited n-type conductivity.39 This indicated some donor levels caused by some impurities or defects, like the vacancy of element S and the interstitial of element Pb, formed within the prepared PbS film, which may be introduced into the film during synthesizing process. According to PEC theories, the generation and separation of charge carriers happens at electrode/electrolyte interface, and then transition happens between electrode surface and underlying substrate due to semiconductor photoexcitation.40 For n-type semiconductors, the anodic photocurrent should be dominated by instantaneous photo-induced transition of electrons between electrolyte and ITO/glass via PbS film (Fig. 2).
Although the photocurrent and dark current within PdS film was not so stable at a certain level due to surface states, the photocurrent exhibited a good reproducibility during the successive light on–off cycles. Moreover, no overshoot phenomenon was found, which will destroy the square-wave characteristics of the signal and it is usually observed in inorganic semiconductor based PEC cells.40–42 The suppression of photocurrent overshoot here means back electron transfer was slower than the electron transfer from the conduction band of PbS film to the electrolyte.40,41 More impressively, the PbS film can also be excited by the light within SWIR spectrum range. When PdS/ITO/glass electrode was excited by light within the whole spectrum range, it exhibited a pronounced Jp of 10.4 μA cm−2, roughly 3.8 times larger than that measured when it was excited by the light in SWIR spectrum range (Table 1). In dark, PbS/ITO/glass electrode produced an anodic current density (Jd) of ∼0.26 μA cm−2. The ratio of Jp to Jd (i.e. photosensitivity30,43) increased from ∼11 to 40 when the excited light range was extended from SWIR to the whole spectrum range.

4. Conclusions
In this study, a facile solvent-free element-direct reaction has been applied to in situ grow PbS film on ITO/glass. Firstly, the sulfur was evaporated to have a vapor–solid reaction with the Pb film coated on ITO/glass in a sealed Teflon-lined autoclave without oxygen. After reacting for 10 h at 150 °C, Pb film was completely transformed into cubic PbS film with good crystallinity. The atomic ratio of Pb to S was calculated based on EDX and XPS spectra, both results indicated the prepared PbS film was near-stoichiometry. Many over-grown grains formed on the surface of PbS film because of un-even Pb content distribution within the precursor film. The ∼1.5 μm grains as high as 800 nm distributing evenly over the entire surface, while the underlying PbS film was mainly consisted of particles as big as ∼200 nm. Besides, some small particles existed between the grains to exhibit an intensive blue-shifted interband absorption as ∼10 nm PbS quantum dots. PEC study showed that the PbS film displayed an efficient photocurrent response and n-type conductivity.
Overall, a unique and efficient solvent-free element-direct reaction process was developed to prepare high quality PbS film with great adhesion on Pb coated ITO/glass substrate. Thanks to the solvent-free process, the film delamination issue in other element-direct-solvothermal processes was avoided. The method provides a new strategy to simplify synthesis steps and reduce production cost. More importantly, it provides a potential common route to prepare other types of metal-sulfide films on the desired substrates.
