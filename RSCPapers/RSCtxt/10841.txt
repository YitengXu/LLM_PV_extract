    , Accepted 7th August 2021First published on 9th August 2021AbstractA low cost H3PW12O40 (PW12)/CoS2 complex is prepared and used as a counter electrode (CE) to combine with sandwich quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) composed of a TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanode and polysulfide electrolyte to study their photovoltaic properties via a simple hydrothermal method. Under standard simulated sunlight, the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2%PW12 (PW12-2/CoS2) doped CEs was 6.29%, which was significantly 67.7% higher than those of QDSSCs based on undoped CoS2 CEs (3.75%). Due to the introduction of PW12, the nanoparticles forming the hollow structure of CoS2 changed from regular octahedra to rough nanoparticles, which increase the active sites. At the same time, the work function of CoS2 decorated with PW12 is decreased. This study and discovery demonstrate that POMs can be used to optimize CE materials and improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of QDSSCs, which provide an experimental and theoretical basis for subsequent investigations.
1. Introduction
As the continuous consumption of non-renewable energy intensifies the problem of environmental pollution and global warming, it is extremely urgent to search for novel environment-friendly renewable energy sources. Solar energy is favored due to its abundant reserves and wide range of applications, among which solar cells have attracted widespread attention. Particularly, quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) belong to the third generation of solar cells,1,2 and possess a similar structure to dye-sensitized cells (DSSCs), which have a sandwich structure composed of a photoanode with a quantum dot sensitizer, a polysulfide electrolyte, and a counter electrode.3 QDSSCs have the advantages of controlling the size of quantum dots to adjust the band gap,4 a wide light absorption range, a high extinction coefficient,5 a multi-exciton effect (MEG),6 a low material cost and a simple operation process. Thus, they are considered as promising photovoltaic cells with certain development potential and application prospects.7 At present, making use of ZnCuInSe (ZCISe)/ZnSe quantum dots with a core–shell structure as the photoanode and nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon supported by titanium mesh (N-MC/Ti) as the counter electrode is investigated by Zhong's group, and the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) certified by this kind of cell is 13.49%.8 Nonetheless, it is still far from the theoretical limit of photoelectric conversion efficiency (about 40%).9 Furthermore, it is also conspicuously inferior to the conversion efficiency of DSSCs.10 Hence, it is extraordinarily necessary to optimize their components to boost the photoelectric performance of QDSSCs.
In recent years, several research studies have focused primarily on quantum dot sensitized photoanodes, but relatively few investigations have focused on counter electrodes in the research field of QDSSCs. Nevertheless, the CE is indispensable in the composition of QDSSCs and principally plays a crucial role in collecting and transporting electrons and catalytic reduction electrolytes.11–13 Generally speaking, the reported counter electrode materials are principally divided into five categories, namely precious metals, polymers, metal compounds (sulfides and oxides), carbon derivatives, and composites. Pt, as the most common precious metal, exhibits high catalytic activity for the I−/I3− electrolyte in DSSCs.14 However, the catalytic effect of Pt in QDSSCs is unsatisfactory; it will adsorb sulfur atoms in the polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−) electrolyte, resulting in the increase of the resistance to the counter electrode interface and electrolyte, while reducing the cell performance. Moreover, precious metals are expensive and the production cost is high.15–17 Polymers used as electrode materials primarily include PEDOT, polypyrrole (PPy) and polythiophene (PT). Among the polymer CEs, although PEDOT has good cell efficiency, its catalytic effect is non-ideal, and the polymer electrode needs further exploration.18 At present, most of the counter electrodes of QDSSCs adopt metal sulfides (such as CuS, Cu2S, CuxS, NiS, CoS, CoS2, PdS, CuInS2, etc.), which have high catalytic activity for the polysulfide electrolyte and low resistance.19–27 However, they also have certain disadvantages under this circumstance. The stability of sulfide CEs becomes poor and the lifetime becomes shorter due to the long-term corrosion of the electrolyte. In order to alter this situation, carbon materials can be introduced to form composite CEs such as RGO/Cu2S, which combine the high stability and conductivity of carbon materials with the superior catalytic activity of sulfides to enhance their cell performance.28 In addition, because composite materials combine the multiple advantages of different materials to promote their conversion efficiency, other composite CEs in QDSSCs have also been studied extensively, such as Cu2S/PbS, CoS/NiS, NiS/PdS, Cu/SnS, Ti3C2/CuS, etc.29–33 However, continuously optimizing and discovering novel counter electrode materials is a pivotal move that researchers recognize as essential to improve the photoelectric performance of QDSSCs.
The bonding ability of sulfur–metal is so weak that it can be easy to perform a conversion reaction in transition metal sulfides. Among these sulfides, CoS2 has a pyrite structure and belongs to the AB2 type cubic crystal compound with high theoretical capacity, electrical conductivity and good electro-catalytic performance, which can commendably stimulate the transformation of polysulfides.34,35 In addition to the above benefits, CoS2 reserves are considerable and distributed over a wide area, it has low operation cost, and has the prospect of further development. It is a low-cost material with high natural abundance.36 In a nutshell, the advantages have enabled it to be extensively applied in the field of electrodes and electrocatalysis, such as lithium batteries, and solar cells.37–41 In view of this, many scientists have worked to realize this and have made great progress in this field. Paber et al. prepared a CoS2 film CE on the basis of thermally vulcanizing a simple cobalt film on glass, and obtained a 4.16% PCE in QDSSCs.25 Punnoose et al. obtained a conversion efficiency of 2.27% using a hydrothermal deposition method, depositing nano-sized CoS2 films on FTO as a counter electrode using 3-mercaptopropionic acid.42 Nevertheless, the limited research conducted thus far indicates relatively few investigations into CoS2 as a counter electrode in QDSSCs; consequently, further exploration and optimization of CoS2 CEs are still needed.
In this work, a TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS co-sensitized photoanode was selected. CdS and CdSe QDs have complementary effects on light capture. In the cascade structure of the TiO2/CdS/CdSe electrode, the energy level recombination between CdS and CdSe forms a stepped energy level structure with edges, which is conducive to the electron injection and hole recovery of CdS and CdSe quantum dots.43 The ZnS passivation layer inhibits the recombination of excited state electrons at the electrode/electrolyte interface, which is beneficial for improving the performance of solar cells.44,45
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a type of metal–oxide cluster compound formed by virtue of transition metal ions through oxygen connection. By virtue of the diversity of the structure and composition of POMs, the properties of POMs are also varied among oxidation reducibility, photocatalytic performance and photoelectrical performance.46–48 POMs can receive and transfer excited electrons in semiconductor materials, reducing the combination of electrons and holes.49 The efficiency of electron transport can be improved, thus elevating the efficiency of cell conversion by means of combining semiconductor materials with suitable POMs.
As far as we know, there has been little related research focused on doping Keggin-type H3PW12O40 (PW12) in the process of hydrothermal synthesis of CoS2, and using composite materials (PW12/CoS2) as counter electrodes to investigate the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs. Therefore, a novel preparation method relying on high-performance PW12/CoS2 counter electrodes for quantum dot sensitized solar cells via etching octahedral CoS2 with PW12 is put forward. First and foremost, cobalt chloride (CoCl2·6H2O) was used as the cobalt source, and sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3·5H2O) as the sulfur source was used to synthesize the low-cost hollow structure CoS2 using a hydrothermal method. Subsequently, PW12 was combined with CoS2 according to different mass ratios. The morphological structure, valence and electrochemical properties of CoS2 doped with PW12 were investigated and analyzed by multiple characterization tests in detail.
The surface work function is regarded as an extraordinarily imperative physical parameter. As far as semiconductor materials are concerned, it can be regarded as the ability of photo-generated electrons to migrate to the surface in photocatalytic reactions.50,51 Hence, it is feasible to use appropriate doping in the system to adjust the surface work function of semiconductor materials to promote the dynamic behavior of photo-generated carriers and improve the photovoltaic performance of the cell. Based on the effect of surface work function, we try to apply this method to the characterization of CEs in QDSSCs. In this work, the doping of PW12 reduces the surface function of CoS2, and the smaller electron confinement ability promotes the migration of electrons participating in the chemical reaction, thus improving the CE performance.
Ultimately, the photovoltaic performance test revealed that the CoS2 CE doped with 2% PW12 (PW12-2/CoS2) displayed a higher short-circuit current density (JSC) of 21.08 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.662 V, a filling factor (FF) of 0.45, and a photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.29%. All performance parameters were certainly improved in contrast with a bare CoS2 CE. At the same time, electrochemical analysis reveals that the addition of PW12 can effectively increase the active sites, reduce the charge transfer resistance between the CE and electrolyte, and strengthen the electrocatalytic activity and electrochemical stability.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O, AR), sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate (Na2S2O3·5H2O, AR), Keggin-type polyoxometalate H3PW12O40·xH2O (PW12), terpineol (C10H18O, CP), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, AR), thiourea (H2NCSNH2, AR), potassium chloride (KCl, AR), zinc acetate dihydrate (C4H6O4Zn·2H2O, AR), sodium sulfite (Na2SO3, AR), trisodium nitrilotriacetate (N(CH2COONa)3, AR), and absolute methanol are Sinopharm reagents. Sodium sulfide (Na2S·9H2O, AR), titanium oxide (TiO2, Degussa, P25), cadmium sulfate (CdSO4·8/3H2O, AR), chromium chloride (CdCl2·5/2H2O, AR), Se powder and S powder are Aladdin's reagents.
2.2 Preparation of CoS2 and PW12/CoS2
CoS2 was synthesized using a simple hydrothermal method according to the literature.52,53 5 mmol CoCl2·6H2O (1.379 g) and 10 mmol Na2S2O3·5H2O (2.482 g) were dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water and stirred continuously for 1 h. The resulting solution was pink. It was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-lined autoclave, and heated to 140 °C for 12 h, and then naturally cooled to room temperature. The black precipitate produced via the reaction was collected by centrifugation and then washed several times with distilled water and ethanol. Eventually, the product was added into an oven and dried at 60 °C for 12 h.
The overall preparation method of PW12/CoS2 is similar to that mentioned above except adding PW12. Three PW12/CoS2 CEs (PW12-1/CoS2, PW12-2/CoS2, PW12-3/CoS2) with mass percentages of 1%, 2% and 3% were prepared, respectively.
2.3 Preparation of CoS2 and PW12/CoS2 counter electrodes
According to the ratio of 1:3, 0.06 g of CoS2 (PW12/CoS2) and 0.18 g of terpineol were added to an agate mortar, followed by adding 6 ml of ethanol and ground for about 1.5 h to form a paste. The ground paste was printed on the conductive surface of FTO glass by a screen printing method, and baked on an electric heating plate at 80 °C for 20 min. It was then annealed at 350 °C for 35 min to increase the bonding between the CE film and the FTO conductive surface.
2.4 Preparation of the TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanodes
A certain amount of TiO2 (P25) and terpineol were ball-milled for 12 h to form TiO2 slurry according to a mass ratio of 1:6. Then TiO2 paste was coated on the pretreated FTO conductive surface (0.9 × 0.9 cm2 active area) by scraping and coating methods, and finally dried at 80 °C, and annealed at 500 °C for 35 min.
According to the literature,21 CdS and CdSe quantum dots were successively deposited on the TiO2 film by a chemical deposition bath. First, CdS quantum dot solutions were prepared by dissolving 0.183 g of CdCl2, 0.177 g of NH4Cl, and 0.533 g of thiurea in 50 mL of deionized water and stirring. The pH of the mixed solution was adjusted with ammonia water to 9.5. The TiO2 photoanode was immersed in CdS solution and kept in a 5 °C refrigerator for 4 h. Then it was removed and rinsed with deionized water, and dried naturally. Next the CdSe quantum dot solution was prepared. 0.384 g of CdSO4 and 0.7712 g of N(CH2COONa)3 (NTA) were dissolved in 15 mL of deionized water, respectively, and the two solutions were mixed. 15 mL of the Na2SeSO3 solution (0.1 M Se powder reflux into 0.3 M Na2SO3 solution, condensing reflux at 105 °C for 8 h and collecting the filtrate) prepared in advance was poured into the mixed solution. The TiO2/CdS photoanode was immersed in CdSe solution and kept for 6 h in a refrigerator at 5 °C. Finally, the TiO2/CdS/CdSe photoanode was used to deposit the ZnS passivation layer. The TiO2/CdS/CdSe photoanode was immersed in 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2 solution and 0.1 M Na2S solution four times in turn, each time for 2 min. Deionized water was used to flush the photoanode during ion exchange.
2.5 Fabrication of QDSSCs
The TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanode and CoS2 (PW12-1/CoS2, PW12-2/CoS2, PW12-3/CoS2) counter electrodes were clamped, and injected with a polysulfide electrolyte (0.5 M Na2S, 0.125 M S, 0.25 M KCl and methanol–water (3:7 volume ratio)), and then sealed with hot melt. The effective active surface area of the cell was set to 0.12 cm2.
2.6 Characterization
A Siemens D5005 diffractometer with Cu-Kα (L = 1.5418 Å) radiation was used for the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) test, and the test range of the sample was 20 to 80°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed by using a USWHA150 photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic light source Al Kα (1486.6 eV). A scanning electron microscope (Hitachi SU-8000 FE-SEM) with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDX) was used to analyse the morphology and composition of the sample. A transmission electron microscope (TEM) with a JEM-2100 F microscope was used to perform imaging tests on samples at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. A CHI661D electrochemical workstation was used to obtain photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) curves under simulated sunlight (500 W xenon lamps filtered by using AM 1.5 G filters with an average light intensity of 100 mW cm−2). To further study the electrochemical catalytic performance of the counter electrodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel-polarization curves tests were performed on the CHI661D electrochemical workstation under dark conditions. Electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at an amplitude of 0.01 V and in a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 1 M Hz. The scanning rate was 5 mV s−1 when Tafel-polarization curves were tested.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the synthesis process of the PW12/CoS2 complex and its application in QDSSCs. The PW12/CoS2 complex with a hollow structure was prepared by a simple hydrothermal method, and the complex was used as a counter electrode, then the QDSSCs were formed together with a CdS/CdSe QD co-sensitized photoanode and polysulfide electrolyte.

3.1. Morphology and composition
The morphologies of CoS2 and the PW12/CoS2 complex were observed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 2a and b show the SEM images of CoS2; as can be seen from Fig. 2a, the morphology of CoS2 is a hollow structure made up of regular octahedra. Fig. 2d and e reveal the SEM images of PW12-2/CoS2. With the etching of PW12, the morphology of PW12-2/CoS2 becomes a hollow structure made up of rough nano-particles, exposing more active sites. The morphology of PW12-1/CoS2 and PW12-3/CoS2 is similar to that of PW12-2/CoS2 (Fig. S1†). Fig. 2c and f show the cross sections of the thin films of the CoS2 and PW12-2/CoS2 samples prepared by screen printing, respectively. Through EDX analysis, the Co, S, P and W element signals in the sample are given in Fig. S2,† and the composition of the sample PW12-2/CoS2 is further explained. Fig. S3 and S4† display the element mapping distribution of the CoS2 and PW12-2/CoS2 samples respectively, manifesting that the Co and S element signals stem from the CoS2 sample, and the Co, S, P and W element signals arise from the PW12-2/CoS2 sample.

Fig. 3a shows a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the PW12-2/CoS2 complex, allowing us to further understand the morphological hollow structure of the PW12-2/CoS2 complex. It turns out that PW12-2/CoS2 is a hollow structure piled up with an abundance of nanoparticles. Fig. 3b shows a high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the PW12-2/CoS2 complex. The lattice fringe spacing on the sample surface is 0.28 nm, corresponding to the (200) plane of the cubic crystal system CoS2. The PW12-2/CoS2 hollow structure has internal void space, which reduces the ion diffusion distance, thus improving the reaction kinetics. Moreover, the exposed active sites on its rough surface can improve the catalytic activity of the reaction. Its special morphology can contact closely with the electrolyte, and the reaction is more sufficient, so as to obtain superior electrochemical performance, which is also an important part of improving the efficiency of the cell.54

In order to more accurately prove the composition of the sample, the XRD measurement was carried out. The XRD patterns of the prepared CoS2 and PW12-2/CoS2 samples are shown in Fig. 4. Fig. S5† shows the XRD patterns of the PW12/CoS2 complexes of other proportions. The PW12-2/CoS2 complex shows apparent diffraction peaks at 2θ = 27.9°, 32.2°, 36.4°, 39.7°, 46.4°, 54.9°, 57.6°, 60.2° and 62.6°, which correspond to the (111), (200), (210), (211), (220), (311), (222), (230) and (321) crystal surfaces of cubic CoS2, respectively, and is analogous to pure CoS2. The content of PW12 in the PW12-2/CoS2 complex is relatively low; no characteristic diffraction peak of PW12 has been detected. The result of the test adheres to the standard card of CoS2 (JCPDS: 41-1471) and makes clear that CoS2 and the PW12-2/CoS2 complex have been successfully prepared.
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of CoS2 and PW12-2/CoS2. 
The infrared spectra of the PW12, CoS2 and PW12-2/CoS2 complex are shown in Fig. 5, respectively. It can be observed that two broad peaks, in the ranges of 1080–1054 cm−1 and 1016–887 cm−1, appear in the spectrogram of the PW12-2/CoS2 complex. The wide peak at 1080–1054 cm−1 is the result of the joint oscillation of the P–O bond at 1071 cm−1 in PW12 and the CoS bond at 1077 cm−1 in CoS2. The peaks in the range of 1016–887 cm−1 are drawn by the common oscillation of the WO bond at 972 cm−1 in PW12, the W–Ob–W bond at 890 cm−1 and the CoS bond at 1013 cm−1 in CoS2.38,47 The above mentioned test results demonstrate that PW12 is successfully combined with CoS2.
 Fig. 5  FTIR spectra of PW12, CoS2 and PW12-2/CoS2. 
The XPS measurement was performed to further determine the chemical element composition and corresponding valence state of the CoS2 and PW12-2/CoS2 samples. As described in Fig. 6d, the characteristic peaks of Co 2p, S 2p, and W 4f are observed in the XPS scan spectra of PW12-2/CoS2. As shown in the XPS scan spectra of CoS2 in Fig. S6†, the characteristic peaks of Co 2p and S 2p in the CoS2 compound were observed. In addition, the high resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p are presented in Fig. 6a. The peaks appearing at 778.3 eV and 793.3 eV are attributed to the binding energy of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 in the PW12-2/CoS2 complex, respectively, which confirms the existence of Co2+ in the complex. The energy level difference between Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 is approximately 15 eV, which conforms to the standard spectrum of Co. The two peaks with binding energies of 783.0 eV and 800.1 eV are satellite peaks of Co2+.38 As depicted in Fig. 6b, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of S 2p reveals two pairs of peaks in S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2. The peaks of S 2p in the PW12-2/CoS2 complex correspond to the binding energies of 162.1 eV and 163.5 eV, attesting that the state of S in the complex is S22− with the valence state of −1, and the peak at 168.6 eV is the satellite peak of S22−.55 Furthermore, in Fig. 6c, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of W 4f reveals that the W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 orbitals correspond to the binding energies of 35.7 eV and 37.7 eV, respectively.56 Compared with CoS2 in Fig. 6a and b, the binding energy of Co 2p and S 2p in the PW12-2/CoS2 complex moves slightly towards the direction of lower binding energy. Since the negative shift of the binding energy represents the increase of the electron density, it means that after doping PW12, the electrons transfer towards CoS2, which makes its electron density increase and binding energy slightly decrease.57,58 Consequently, the sample was prepared successfully on the basis of the XPS measurement.

3.2. Photovoltaic performance of the QDSSCs
In order to investigate the CE repeatability of the QDSSC devices, we tested 10 groups of QDSSC devices based on CoS2 and the PW12-2/CoS2 CEs. Their PCE distribution histogram is depicted in Fig. 7a, which mirrors the repeatability of these cells. Besides, the related photovoltaic performance parameters are generalized in Table S1.†
 Fig. 7  (a) PCE distribution histogram of 10 cells measured for CoS2 and PW12-2/CoS2, (b) J–V curves of QDSSCs with different CEs. 
QDSSCs assembled with different counter electrodes were tested to investigate the catalytic activity of the PW12/CoS2 complexes with different proportions. Fig. 7b illuminates the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the QDSSCs based on the CoS2 CEs and PW12/CoS2 CEs doped with different proportions of PW12. The relevant photovoltaic performance parameters (JSC, VOC, FF and PCE) are listed in Table 1. Conspicuously, it can be seen that the QDSSC assembled with the CoS2 CE possesses the parameters of JSC = 17.17 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.568 V, FF = 0.38 and PCE = 3.75%. However, the photovoltaic performance parameters of the QDSSCs based on the PW12/CoS2 CEs are improved, among which the QDSSC equipped with the PW12-2/CoS2 CE is superior over others and shows the best performance (JSC = 21.05 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.662 V, FF = 0.45 and PCE = 6.29%). It is becoming increasingly clear that PW12 can be used as an excellent electron acceptor to enhance the photovoltaic performance of the CoS2 CEs. Nevertheless, when the content of PW12 increases to 3%, the photovoltaic performance of the PW12-3/CoS2 CE (JSC = 18.67 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.598 V, FF = 0.41, PCE = 4.62%) is distinctly inferior to that of the PW12-2/CoS2 CE, which uncovers the fact that excessive PW12 can have a passive bearing on electronic transport. The I–t measurement results describe that excessive PW12 doping results in reduced photogenerated carrier separation (Fig. S7†). Hence, the results demonstrate that the appropriate amount of PW12 doped in the CoS2 CE can effectively assist in the electron transfer and collection of the CE and reduce the interface recombination, so that the electron transport can be improved and the catalytic activity of the CE can be enhanced to obtain higher performance parameters (FF, VOC and JSC). So, the PCE of QDSSCs was also improved. That is, the overall photovoltaic performance was optimized.

3.3 Electrochemical properties of the counter electrodes
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to analyze the electrocatalytic activity and charge transfer of the CE materials. The Z-view software was used for fitting, and the Nyquist plots of CoS2 and different PW12/CoS2 CEs are displayed in Fig. 8a. The fitting parameters are shown in Table 1. The starting point of the curve in the Nyquist plots was the series resistance (Rs) of the cells. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) between the electrode and the electrolyte can be estimated in accordance with the diameter of the first semicircle (a semicircle in the high frequency region), which represents the process of charge transfer. Furthermore, the right low frequency region denotes the diffusion resistance (Rw) inside the electrolyte. The Rs value of the CoS2 CE (2.878 Ω) is significantly superior to that of the PW12-doped electrodes, and among them, the PW12-2/CoS2 CE has the smallest Rs value (2.049 Ω). The smaller the Rs value, the better the electron transfer between the CE material and the FTO substrate.59,60 Generally, the value of Rct is negatively correlated with the electrocatalytic activity of CEs. The low Rct value plays an imperative role in promoting the PCE and FF of cells. Among them, the Rct value of the PW12-2/CoS2 CE is the smallest, only 0.414 Ω, and indicates good electrocatalytic activity compared to the PW12-1/CoS2, PW12-3/CoS2 and CoS2 CEs. This is because an appropriate amount of PW12 can act as an electron acceptor to capture electrons, reducing the recombination of electrons and holes. Moreover, the conduction band (absolute vacuum scale) of PW12 is −4.72 eV (AVS) and it matches the conduction band of CoS2 (−5.49 eV (AVS)), which is conducive to electron transfer.61 The catalytic activity of the CEs can be enhanced through the synergistic effect of PW12 and CoS2. However, excess PW12 converts from an electron transport intermediary to an electron trap filling site, and prevents the captured electrons from being transferred rapidly, resulting in a reduction in the catalytic performance.49 For the PW12-2/CoS2 CE, the rough nanoparticle surface and small particle size facilitate the charge diffusion within the polysulfide electrolyte, which reduces the Rw value and further promotes the JSC value of the cells.

Moreover, the Bode phase curves are shown in Fig. 8b. We can estimate the electron lifetime (τe) by using the value of the characteristic frequency peaks (fmax) for these CEs and the equation τe = (2πfmax)−1.32 Obviously, the electron lifetime in the CoS2 CE is relatively short, and the CE with PW12 exhibits a longer electron lifetime. The calculation results are shown in Table 1, which shows that the introduction of an appropriate amount of PW12 can prolong the lifetime of the electrons in the CE and enhance their electrochemical performance.
The electrochemical performance of the CEs was further evaluated by the Tafel polarization test. Fig. 9a shows the Tafel polarization curves for different CEs, which denotes the current density logarithm (logJ) and bias voltage changes. Theoretically, the curve is divided into three regions: the low-voltage part (close to 0 V) is the polarization region, the middle curved part is the Tafel region, and the high-voltage part near the horizontal line is the diffusion region.62 Parameters related to electrocatalytic activity can be estimated in the Tafel and diffusion zones; they are exchange current density (J0) and limiting diffusion current density (Jlim). The exchange current density (J0) is obtained at the intersection of the equilibrium potential line, tangent of the cathode and anode branch in the Tafel region. J0 signifies the charge transfer rate between the CEs and the electrolyte when the reaction is in equilibrium.51 The value of J0 is negatively correlated with the value of Rct, and the formula is J0 = RT/nFRct, where R, T, n and F express the gas constant, temperature, number of the transferred electrons involved in the reaction and Faraday constant, respectively. It can be observed from Fig. 9a that the size relationship of J0 is PW12-2/CoS2 CE > PW12-3/CoS2 CE > PW12-1/CoS2 CE > CoS2 CE. Hence, PW12-2/CoS2 exhibits good electrocatalytic activity, which is consistent with the results of the EIS test. The limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) can be estimated by using the current density in the high potential diffusion zone. The PW12-2/CoS2 CE has a high Jlim value, making clear that the electrode has high catalytic activity during the redox reaction with the polysulfide electrolyte, which inhibits the charge recombination and is extremely beneficial for electron transfer. The above test results indicate that the PW12-2/CoS2 CE exhibits good catalytic performance when doped with an appropriate amount of PW12.

Open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) tests were performed to assess the carrier composite dynamics of the QDSSC assembled with these different CEs. As can be demonstrated from the decay curves in Fig. 9b, the QDSSC assembled by the PW12-2/CoS2 CE has a slow VOC decay. It is proved that doping with an appropriate amount of PW12 can effectively decrease the charge recombination rate and prolong the electron lifetime, which is beneficial for improving the photovoltaic performance of the cell.
The chemical stability of the CE materials was observed by virtue of a multi-period cyclic voltammetry (CV) scanning test, and two symmetrical counter electrodes were used for the test. Fig. 9c and d show the C–V curves of the PW12-2/CoS2 CE and CoS2 CE after 50 consecutive periods of scanning, respectively, and the scanning speed is 100 mV s−1. The insets in Fig. 9c and d show only the CV curves for the 1st and 50th cycles. By comparison, it can be seen that the repeatability of the PW12-2/CoS2 CE is visibly superior to that of the CoS2 CE. After multiple cycles, the current density and curve shape of the PW12-2/CoS2 CE have a little change, while the change in those of the CoS2 CE is larger, proving that the electrochemical stability of PW12-2/CoS2 CE is more superior. Hence, doping an appropriate amount of PW12 reduces the recombination of electrons and holes and maintains stable electron transfer, which can not only improve the catalytic activity of the material, but also enhance its electrochemical stability.
The working function of the samples was measured by Kelvin probe technology; CPD means the potential difference between the sample and Au probe.63 The formula for calculating the surface work function of the sample is φsample = φAu + eCPD, (φAu = 5.1 eV). In Fig. 10, the work function of CoS2 decorated with PW12 is decreased, suggesting that the electrons are less bound in PW12-2/CoS2 and have an increased ability to migrate as they participate in chemical reactions. Therefore, decorating with an appropriate amount of PW12 in semiconductor materials can adjust the surface function of the material, improve the dynamic performance of the carrier, and use more effective photoelectric carriers to enhance the photovoltaic performance of the cell.

4. Conclusions
In general, hollow structured CoS2 and PW12/CoS2 samples were prepared by a simple low-temperature hydrothermal method in this paper, and the photovoltaic properties of the samples in QDSSCs were investigated in depth. The photovoltaic performance parameters obtained from the test show that the CE with PW12 can improve the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs to a certain extent. The PCE of the PW12-2/CoS2 CE was the highest (6.29%), which was 67.7% higher than that of the CoS2 CE without PW12. The addition of PW12 not only has a certain influence on the morphology and structure of CoS2, but also plays a mediating role in promoting the electron collection and transportation of CEs, and inhibiting charge recombination. In addition, EIS, Tafel polarization, OCVD and CV tests showed that the addition of an appropriate amount of PW12 can improve the electrocatalytic activity and electrochemical stability of the CoS2 CE. This study provides a new idea for CE material performance optimization, and provides a theoretical basis for the application of environment-friendly polyoxometalates in QDSSCs.
