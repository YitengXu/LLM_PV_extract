    , Accepted 31st October 2021First published on 3rd November 2021AbstractHerein, new iodonium salts based on a 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indecene (B-1) chromophore have been introduced to 3D printing applications. Iodonium salts with different anions such as tosylate, hexafluorophosphate, hexafluoroantimonate, and triflate absorbing in the range up to 600 nm are reported. The usefulness of the new BODIPY derivatives in initiating cationic photopolymerization processes such as epoxide, vinyl ether, oxetane, and glycidyl monomers in the wavelength range from 365 to 520 nm was confirmed using real-time FT-IR and photo-DSC methods. The initiation efficiency of a one-component system was also compared with that of a two-component system consisting of the chromophore (the same as that used for conducting iodonium salts) and iodonium salt – bis-(4-t-butylphenyl)-iodonium hexafluorophosphate. Moreover, the photochemical mechanisms were investigated by steady-state photolysis, ESR fluorescence experiments, theoretical calculations of molecular orbitals, and electrochemical analysis. These studies allowed us to determine the effect of the anion type in iodonium salts on the rate of proton acid generation. The BODIPY derivatives are also efficient for the initiation of cationic and free-radical polymerization. Optical microscopy experiments demonstrated that different patterns can be obtained by experiments with resolution test targets and 3d-printing. Moreover, photoinitiators based on the B-1 chromophore can be used not only for initiating the photopolymerization processes but also as colorimetric sensors for measurements of the degree of photopolymerization.
1. Introduction
Currently, 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (DPPI) known as BODIPY is the prominent fluorophore for life sciences.1–4 DPPI is used in a number of scientific disciplines due to its several valuable properties. DPPI is characterized by high photostability.5 Its valuable properties also include large extinction coefficients,6,7 luminescence emission in the long-wave range,8,9 and high luminescence yield.10–12 DPPI also has fairly long excited singlet state lifetimes, and is characterized by hypersensitivity to environmental perturbation.13 Due to such valuable properties of BODIPY derivatives, they are used in many scientific disciplines. In particular, many literature reports indicate that DPPIs are used in photodynamic therapy14–18 and also as chemosensors.19 They are also used as fluorescent switches,20,21 as labeling reagents,22 and also as fluorescent dyes that both emit and absorb light in the long-wavelength range.23,24 They are also utilized as energy transfer cassettes as well as solar cells sensitized to dyes.25,26
In addition, the dynamic progress in chemistry and photoinitiation process technologies has led to the development of new generation monomers and polymers,27–30 new methods for monitoring photopolymerization processes,31–33 and also new photoinitiation systems (PISs).34,35 Therefore BODIPY is successfully used as a photosensitizer of iodonium salts to initiate cationic photopolymerization. In particular, new PISs based on a pyrromethene dye operating in the visible wavelength range under laser diode irradiation for epoxy monomers and vinyl ethers have been developed.36 On the other hand, in another work, new photoinitiators based on BODIPY and boranil chromophores were proposed. In this work, these photoinitiators were proved to be useful for photosensitization of iodonium salt decomposition. These initiators are useful for initiating cationic photopolymerization of various monomers such as epoxy monomers, epoxy-silicone monomers and also vinyl ethers. The efficient initiation process occurs under the irradiation of laser diodes with wavelengths of 405, 457, 473 and 532 nm.37 BODIPY in combination with an iodonium salt successfully initiates cationic polymerization of epoxy and vinyl monomers under laser diode irradiation. It was also proved that photoinitiating systems based on BF2 derivatives and tetramethylammonium phenyltriethylborate salts are useful for the initiation of photopolymerization of acrylate monomers.38 Recently, novel BODIPYs based on PAGs with D–A and D–π-A conjugation structures have been designed and synthesized. Green and red LED induced acid generation was achieved.39 Recently, BODIPY derivatives have been presented as photosensitizers used in rapid high resolution digital light processing (DLP) by irradiation with a green LED centered at 530 nm.40
Nevertheless, one-component photoinitiators are very interesting due to their initiation efficiency. Several single-component photoinitiators are known for initiating photopolymerization processes, e.g., N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]-1,8-naphthalimide derivatives for initiating radical polymerization at 405 nm or poly(propylene oxide)-thioxanthone as a one-component Type II polymeric photoinitiator for free radical polymerization with low migration behavior.41,42 However, cationic photoinitiators based on diphenyl iodonium salts have a poor matching of the absorption characteristics with the emission characteristics of industrial UV light sources, the so-called medium pressure lamps and UV-LED and Vis-LED diodes. Both for medium-pressure mercury lamps and lamps equipped with UV-LEDs (365 nm, 385 nm, and 395 nm) or Vis-LEDs (e.g., 405 nm, 420 nm, 450 nm, 455 nm, 470 nm, 490 nm, 505 nm, and 530 nm) only a small part of the energy is emitted in the absorption of commercial iodonium photoinitiators. Most cationic initiators do not absorb in the visible range. As a result, the currently used cationic photoinitiators based on diphenyliodium salts have the weak match between the absorption and emission characteristics of industrial UV light sources such as medium pressure lamps along with UV-LEDs and Vis-LEDs.43–47
Therefore, the development of new cationic photoinitiators that will show light sensitivity in the field of medium pressure mercury lamp emission or in the visible range is crucial due to the application phenomena.
Currently, only a few iodonium salts are known to be useful as photoinitiators for polymerization processes that exhibit light absorption above 300 nm. However, initiators that absorb the visible range above 500 nm have not been developed. One of the first initiators that exhibit light absorption above 300 nm is a system based on fluorenone conjugated to an iodonium salt in the form of (9-oxo-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-phenyl-iodonium hexafluoroantimonate(V).48 This photoinitiator has four absorption maxima (267 nm, 298 nm, 380 nm, and 394 nm). It exhibits absorption in the visible range. Nevertheless, the longest-wavelength band located at 394 nm is more than 100 times less intense than the shortest-wavelength band located at 267 nm. The molar extinction coefficient at 394 nm is just ε = 400 mol dm3 mol−1 cm−1, while the molar extinction coefficient at 267 nm is up to ε = 42000 mol dm3 mol−1 cm−1. For this reason (9-Oxo-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-phenyl-iodonium hexafluoroantimonate(V) is not used in industrial applications.
For nearly the next ten years, no significant progress was noted in the development of new iodonium salts that would exhibit improved spectroscopic properties and adjustment of absorption characteristics to the emission characteristics of UV-LED or Vis-LED sources of light. The situation was changed radically when in 2012 Polish scientists published a paper on the new iodonium salts based on the coumarin skeleton.49 They obtained a number of derivatives including (7-alkoxy-4-methylcoumarin-3-yl)phenyl-iodonium, (7-alkoxy-4-methylcoumarin-6-yl)phenyl-iodonium, (5,7-dialkoxy-4-alkylcoumarin-8-yl)phenyl-iodonium, and (7,8-dialkoxy-4-alkylcoumarin-3-yl)phenyl-iodonium. Recently, the mechanism of selected photoinitiators based on coumarin chromophores was also described.50 The position of the absorption maxima for the obtained coumarin-phenyl-iodate salts depends mainly on the conjugation of the phenyliodine group with the coumarin chromophore. Moreover, all of the obtained imitators exhibit good performance in initiating ring-opening cationic polymerization of epoxides (3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane-carboxylate) and cationic polymerization of divinyl ethers. These initiators exhibit high speed and conversion even when using cationic monomers of light sources such as UV-LEDs with 365 nm wavelength and Vis-LED diodes.51
In 2016, detailed photochemical studies on the iodonium photoinitiators based on 1,8-naphthalimide(IV) were published. Therefore, the initiators that exhibit the maximum absorption at 340 nm allowed for efficient cationic photopolymerization of monomers using UV-LEDs.52 However, these initiators are still not commercially available because of the synthesis costs. In this case, the chemical structure of the iodonium salt was complicated, due to the above aspects, the molar mass of the photoinitiator increased, and consequently, the molar efficiency of protic acid generation during the photopolymerization process decreased.
In this paper, new iodonium salts based on the B-1 chromophore with different anions such as tosylate, hexafluorophosphate, hexafluoroantimonate, and triflate absorbing in the range up to 600 nm are presented. The obtained reaction products have been described using spectroscopic methods, which included comprehensive absorption characteristics. Thereafter photochemical mechanisms were investigated, including steady-state photolysis, theoretical calculations, ESR fluorescence experiments, and electrochemical testing. These studies allowed us to determine the effect of the anion type in the iodonium salt on the proton acid generation rate.
Novel iodonium salts based on the B-1 chromophore were proposed for the cationic polymerization of epoxy, epoxy-silicone, and vinyl ether monomers under exposure to different diodes. The usefulness of the new BODIPY derivatives in initiating cationic photopolymerization processes in the wavelength range from 365 to 520 nm was confirmed. Moreover, the initiation efficiency of a one-component system was also compared with that of a two-component system consisting of a chromophore (the same as that used for conducting iodonium salts). Therefore, this study approach examined the structure/reactivity/effectiveness relationship of novel BODIPY derivatives in cationic photopolymerization under different Vis-LED light sources.
2. Experiments
2.1. Materials
The four novel iodonium salts based on the 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indecene chromophore were investigated for the role of photoinitiators using cationic photopolymerization processes and one chromophore (B-1) which was used to conjugate iodonium salts. Tosylate phenyl[4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene]iodonium (B-IOD-TsO), hexafluorophosphate phenyl[4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene]iodonium (B-IOD-PF6), hexafluoroantimonate phenyl[4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene]iodonium (B-IOD-SbF6), and triflate phenyl[4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene]iodonium (B-IOD-CF3SO3) were used. Compounds B-IOD-TsO, B-IOD-PF6, B-IOD-SbF6, and B-IOD-CF3SO3 are photonitiators based on chromophore B-1, having different anions: tosylate (B-IOD-TsO), hexafluorophosphate (B-IOD-PF6), hexafluoroantimonate (B-IOD-SbF6), and triflate (B-IOD-CF3SO3). The new photoinitiators were synthesized according to the procedures described in the patent.53 The structures of these compounds are shown in Fig. 1 and the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra are presented in Fig. S1–S8.†

2.2. Monomers and other chemicals
Triethylene glycol divinyl ether (TEGDVE, Sigma Aldrich) as a model vinyl ether monomer and 3,4-epoxy cyclohexylmethyl 3,4-epoxycyclohexanecarboxylate (CADE, commercial name UVACURE® 1500, Allnex) as a model epoxy monomer were used for the compositions photo-cured by cationic photopolymerization. 2-Bis[4-(glycidyloxy)phenyl]propane (bisphenol A diglycidyl ether – DGEBA Sigma Aldrich) and 1,4-bis[(3-ethyl-3-oxiranylmethoxy)methyl]benzene (OXT121, Tagosei Co., Ltd) were employed for the compositions polymerized for photo-DSC experiments.
Moreover, in a two-component photoinitiating system consisting of chromophore B-1 and iodonium salt, for the role of a cationic photoinitiator bis-(4-t-butylphenyl)-iodonium hexafluorophosphate (Speedcure 938, Lambson) was utilized. Trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA, Allnex) as an acrylate monomer and ethyl 4-(dimethylamino)benzoate (EDB, Sigma Aldrich) were used in two or three component systems based on chromophore B-1. Diethyleneglycol divinyl ether (DVE-2 Sigma Aldrich) was used for the experiment with the resolution test targets. The structures of these compounds are presented in Fig. 2.

2.3. Spectral measurements (absorbance and steady state photolysis)
The absorption spectra of the new BODIPY derivatives were recorded in acetonitrile (analytical grade from Sigma Aldrich) using a SilverNova spectrometer (StellarNet, Inc., Tampa, FL, USA). The spectrometer was coupled to a broadband tungsten deuterium UV-Vis light source (StellarNet, Inc., Tampa, FL, USA). For this study a quartz cuvette with an optical path of 1.0 cm was used. During the measurements, cuvettes with the appropriate BODIPY were irradiated with UV-LED-365 M365L2, Vis-LED-405 M405L3, Vis-LED-420 M420L3, Vis-LED-455 M4550L3, Vis-LED-470 M470L3, Vis-LED-490 M490L3, Vis-LED-505 M505L3, and Vis-LED-530 M530L3 (Thorlabs Inc., Tampa, FL, USA) emitting light with wavelengths at λmax = 365 nm, 405 nm, 420 nm, 455 nm, 470 nm, 490 nm, 505 nm, and 530 nm in 20 minutes time. The light source was powered by a DC2200 regulated power supply (Thorlabs Inc., Tampa, FL, USA). UV-Vis spectra were recorded with a deuterium-halogen UV/Vis SL5 light source (StellarNet, Inc., Tampa, FL, USA).
2.4. ESR spin-trapping (ESR-ST) experiments
An X-band spectrometer (Magnettech MS400) was used to ESR-ST experiments. The radicals were generated under LED@470 nm exposure at room temperature. A tube with 5 mm outside diameter (NMR tube) for the chromophore (B-1) or a 50 μl capillary for initiators were used. Speedcure 938 and co-initiator (B-1) were dissolved in tert-butylbenzene and the initiators were dissolved in tert-butylbenzene-acetonitrile (50:50). Subsequently, the test samples were purged with nitrogen. Then they were irradiated in the cavity (TE102) of the spectrometer. The radicals were trapped by the reagent phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN, TCI).
2.5. Computational procedure for new iodonium salt – prediction of homolytic and heterolytic cleavage of the I–C bond
Molecular orbital calculations were carried out with the Gaussian03 program. The HOMO and LUMO for novel cationic photoinitiators were calculated with the time dependent density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-31G* level on the relaxed geometries calculated at the uB3LYP/6-31G* level.
2.6. Determination of oxidation and reduction potentials using electrochemical investigations
The cyclic voltammetry method was used to measure the oxidation and reduction potentials of new compounds, derivatives of BODIPY. The description of the procedure to perform the tests was presented in a previous article.50
2.7. Real-time FT-IR method for monitoring kinetics of photopolymerization processes
The real-time FT-IR method has been used to study cationic photopolymerization processes using new photoinitiators. The apparatus consisted of an i10 NICOLET™ spectrometer with a horizontal adapter (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
The compositions for the experiments were prepared in a darkened room and in dark glass vials. The photoinitiator or chromophore/Speedcure 938 and the monomer were placed in the dark vials and the whole mixture was mixed on a magnetic stirrer.
The final conversion rates of the given functional groups were calculated from eqn (1): (1)where, AB is the area of the absorbance band that is characteristic of a given monomer as well as the type of photopolymerization before the photopolymerization and AA is the area of an identical absorbance peak, however, after the polymerization process.
For each type of photopolymerization process, and thus for each type of monomer, characteristic absorbance bands are assigned. The progress of the cationic photopolymerization process of the vinyl monomer (TEGDVE) was monitored at a wave number of 1620 cm−1 for 500 s, while for the epoxy monomer (CADE) the characteristic wave number was 790 cm−1. The photopolymerization process of CADE was performed for 900 s. To expose the compositions, the same diodes were used as for the photolysis process. The exact values of the current and irradiance of the diodes are given later in the article, in the Results and discussion section. The UV-LED or VIS-LED was activated 10 s after the beginning of the spectral recordings. The distance between the optical fiber with the integrated diode and the test composition was 2.1 cm.
2.8. Photo-DSC for monitoring the photopolymerization processes
A Photo-DSC 204 F1 Phoenix® (Netzsch, Gerätebau GmbH – Germany) was used to perform photo-DSC tests. For the photopolymerization processes, a UV-LED at 365 nm Bluepoint LED eco spot curing system (manufactured by Hönle UV Technology, Germany) was employed. For the experiments, the light intensity was set to 1.4 W cm−2 at the end of the optical fiber. It was measured using the OmniCure® R2000 radiometer (Excelitas Technologies®, Ontario, Canada). All photo-DSC measurements were carried out under an inert atmosphere. The nitrogen flow rate was 20 ml min−1. In addition, they were conducted at a constant temperature of 25 °C. The tested sample of mass 2 ± 0.5 mg was placed in aluminum crucibles. The heat flow of the photopolymerization process was registered as the time function. The conversion (α) depends on many parameters such as: the molecular weight of the monomer, its density, functionality and the theoretical enthalpy per one mole of a functional group of the given monomer (ΔHtheoretical). ΔHtheoretical values were 107 kJ mol−1 for oxetane monomers,54 80.6 kJ mol−1 for glycidyl monomers,55 and 96.7 kJ mol−1 for epoxy monomers.56 Conversion was calculated with eqn (2):  (2) where, M is the molecular mass of the monomer [g mol−1]; f is the functionality of the monomer; ΔHo is the enthalpy of polymerization [J mol−1] (calculated in one functional group); H is the heat flow [W]; and mp is the sample mass [g].
The polymerization rate (Rp) was also calculated from the following eqn (3): (3)where, dm is the density of composition [g ml−1]; ΔHo is the enthalpy of polymerization [J mol−1] (calculated in one functional group); H is the heat flow [W]; and mp is the sample mass [g].
2.9. Time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy – fluorescence lifetime
Fluorescence lifetime measurements were carried out using DeltaFlexTM (Horiba). A nanoLED with a maximum at 370 nm was used as the pulsed excitation source. A Ludox colloidal silica solution (Sigma Aldrich) strongly diluted in distilled water was employed as the scatterer. The deconvolution procedure using software allowed us to estimate the fluorescence lifetimes of the tested compounds by matching the decay curves. The fluorescence decay curves were adjusted with the exponential function to obtain the lifetime τ.
2.10. Nanosecond laser flash photolysis (LFP)
Nanosecond laser flash photolysis (LFP) experiments were performed analogously to a previous paper.50
2.11. Experiment with the resolution test targets
For standard resolution target experiments, the one component initiators consisting of BODIPY derivatives and different monomers were used. The investigated compositions were placed near the imaging lens of the source of light, a 405 nm M405LP1 Vis-LED (1.4 A, Thorlabs Inc., Tampa, FL, USA). The compositions were deposited onto microscope slides and were polymerized under polypropylene films. The generated patterns were analyzed with a numerical optical microscope (DSX-HRSU OLYMPUS corporation).
2.12. 3D printing experiments
For laser writing and 3D printing experiments, a laser diode at 405 nm with an intensity of 3500 mW cm−2 (spot size ∼50 μm) was used for spatially controlled irradiation (NEJE Master 3500 mW). The photosensitive formulations (1 or 2 mm thick) were deposited onto a microscope slide. Then the compositions were polymerized under air. The patterns were analyzed by using a numerical optical microscope (DSX-HRSU from OLYMPUS Corporation).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Spectroscopic properties of BODIPY derivatives
The UV-Vis spectra of the BODIPY derivatives were recorded in acetonitrile to obtain the absorption characteristic maxima and then the associated extinction coefficient at the wavelength of maximum absorption. The ground state absorption spectra of the novel iodonium photoinitiators based on the B-1 chromophore are shown in Fig. 3. The use of various anions has a non-significant influence on the spectroscopic properties of the novel iodonium salts. Nevertheless, the proposed iodonium salts absorb strongly at a visible range of spectrum up to approximately 600 nm. These compounds exhibit an absorption maximum within the long-wavelength range between 474 and 476 nm. Moreover, all investigated cationic photoinitiators are characterized by good molar extinction coefficients in the 400–600 nm range, which reach values around 28000–32000 [dm3 mol−1 cm−1]. The molar extinction coefficients of BODIPY derivatives at different wavelengths are listed in Table 1. It is also important that the use of various anions does not affect the absorption spectrum shift, but only affects the intensity. The highest intensity of the spectrum was recorded for the hexafluorophosphate phenyl[4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene]iodonium (B-IOD-PF6) and the lowest intensity for the tosylate phenyl[4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene]iodonium (B-IOD-TsO). In addition, the chromophore exhibits a bathochromic shift of the absorption spectrum and simultaneously a slightly lower molar extinction coefficient of 22115 dm3 mol−1 cm−1 compared to iodonium salts.

In summary, BODIPY derivatives are shifted to longer wavelengths due to the built BODIPY chromophore compared to commercial iodonium salts, which allow an efficient matching with the emission of diodes such as 470 nm.
3.2. Photolysis in acetonitrile under the Vis-LED at 470 nm and different currents for BODIPY derivatives
During the spectroscopic investigation of the BODIPY derivatives, their steady state photolysis was also analyzed upon exposure to the Vis-LED at 470 nm (and 0.65 mW cm−2). During the photolysis experiment of chromophore B-1 in acetonitrile, no changes in the absorption spectrum were observed (Fig. 4A). This shows that B-1 is stable and does not undergo degradation upon exposure to the Vis-LED at 470 nm (0.65 mW cm−2). On the other hand, the steady state photolysis of the photoinitiators based on the chromophore BODIPY occurs very fast. In Fig. 4B the photolysis of hexafluorophosphate phenyl[4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene]iodonium under irradiation with the Vis-LED at 470 nm (0.65 mW cm−2) is presented. The steady state photolysis of the remaining compounds is shown in Fig. S13–S16.† It can be seen that absorption bands at 476 nm decrease and, simultaneously, the absorption band at 502 nm increases. The increase of the band at 502 nm indicates that the chromophore or its derivative was regenerated. The hexafluorophosphate phenyl[4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene]iodonium (B-IOD-PF6) decomposes as a result of exposure to the Vis-LED at 470 nm (0.65 mW cm−2). An isobestic point at 489 nm suggests a clean cleavage process without side reaction (see below).

In the next step, the effect of light intensity on the photoinitiator decomposition rate was investigated. For this purpose, the hexafluorophosphate phenyl[4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene]iodonium (B-IOD-PF6) in acetonitrile was irradiated using the Vis-LED emitting light with the wavelength at λmax = 470 nm and the following light intensity values on the sample: 0.65, 1.95, 3.25, 6.50, and 16.25 mW cm−2 (Fig. S17–S21†). Fig. 5 show profiles demonstrating the changes in the absorbance with time for B-IOD-PF6 at 470 nm and different light intensities. It can be seen that the higher the light intensity used, the faster the initiator decay and regeneration of the chromophore or chromophore derivative was faster. The photolysis process is completed after around 50 seconds when the sample is irradiated with the Vis-LED at 470 nm and an intensity of 16.25 mW cm−2. On the other hand, when the sample was irradiated with the Vis-LED at 470 nm and an intensity of only 0.65 mW cm−2, the photolysis process lasted approximately 800 seconds.

3.3. Impact of initiator absorption (B-IOD-PF6) on the photolysis rate
The effect of light sources used on the decay rate of the B-IOD-PF6 photoinitiator was also investigated. For this purpose, the initiator in acetonitrile was irradiated by using different UV-LEDs and Vis-LEDs (@365 nm, @405 nm, @420 nm, @455 nm, @470 nm, @490 nm, @505 nm, and @530 nm, respectively) with the same light intensity on the sample (1.95 mW cm−2) for 800 seconds (Fig. S22–S29†). In Fig. 6, profiles illustrating changes in absorbance overtime of the hexafluorophosphate 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene upon exposure to UV-LED @365 nm, Vis-LED @405 nm, Vis-LED @420 nm, Vis-LED @455 nm, Vis-LED @470 nm, Vis-LED @490 nm, Vis-LED @505 nm, and Vis-LED @530 nm, respectively, are presented. The correlation between the value of the molar extinction coefficient and the speed of the photolysis process is observed. The greater the molar extinction coefficient, the faster the photolysis. The highest molar extinction coefficient for the B-IOD-PF6 initiator is at 470 nm (30047 dm3 mol−1 cm−1). The lowest molar extinction coefficient for the B-IOD-PF6 initiator is at 530 nm (5536 dm3 mol−1 cm−1). Such a low molar extinction coefficient at 530 nm means that the photolysis process does not take place.

3.4. Photolysis in acetonitrile under the Vis-LED at 470 nm and a constant current of 1.95 mW for cationic photoinitiators with different anions
The influence of the anion in the initiators on their decay rate was also investigated. In Fig. 7 the dependence of A/A0 at 476 nm on time for different BODIPY derivatives under irradiation with the Vis-LED at 470 nm and a constant current (1.95 mW cm−2) is presented. The photolysis process for novel photoinitiators occurs at different speeds, which results from the different nucleophilicities of anions in the photoinitiator. In general, new initiators have the same cation and different anions with different nucleophilicities. The larger the size of the anion, the lower its nucleophilicity and the faster the photolysis process and thus the faster the speed of photopolymerization propagation. The decrease of absorption bands at 476 nm is the fastest for hexafluoroantimonate 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (B-IOD-SbF6) and the slowest for tosylate phenyl[4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene]iodonium (B-IOD-TsO).

3.5. Chemical mechanism
All novel photoinitiators based on chromophore B-1 were photo-dissociated as a result of light absorption. After irradiating the photoinitiators with 470 nm wavelength, photodissociation typically occurred from an excited singlet state. Photodissociation of the photoinitiators may occur by both homolytic and heterolytic carbon–iodine bond breaking mechanisms (Fig. 8). Simultaneously in ESR spin trapping experiments (Fig. 9) phenyl radicals Ph˙ are observed during the photolysis of BODIPY derivatives–iodonium salts (hyperfine coupling constants: aN = 14.6 G; aH = 2.6 G for the Ph˙/PBN adducts). The radicals/PBN adducts are produced before irradiation. This is due to the fact that the ESR experiments are highly sensitive (typically in the nanomolar range) and the signals before irradiation just show the sensitivity of the iodonium to day light (even with some protection); the visible light absorption of these compounds is very good and free radicals can be observed.57 The radicals are formed from the cleavage of the C–I (1) bond, presented in eqn (1). Nevertheless, theoretically it is possible to break another C–I (2) bond. Therefore, the possible dissociation mechanisms of BODIPY derivatives were calculated at the uB3LYP/LANL2DZ level. Molecular orbital calculations showed that the bond dissociation energy (BDE) for C–I (1) is 32.44 kcal mol−1 and for Ph–I (2) it is 69.25 kcal mol−1. Rather, this suggests a selective I–Ph cleavage reaction, which is in full accord with the detection of only one type of carbon-centered radical (Ph˙) in ESR-ST.

It was proved that in the steady state photolysis of these initiators the ground state absorption bands decreased at about 470 nm as a result of eqn (1) and, concomitantly, the absorption at 502 nm increased. This suggested that the photoproducts were formed. Moreover, the presence of isosbestic points shows that no side reaction occurs.
3.6. Applicability of BODIPY derivatives as one-component photoinitiators for cationic photopolymerization of various types of monomers
In the next step, the cationic polymerization of the epoxy monomer (CADE) and photopolymerization processes of the vinyl monomer (TEGDVE) in the presence of one-component novel BODIPY derivatives was investigated. For the CADE monomer, the characteristic band appears at wavelength 790 cm−1. During the photopolymerization process, the disappearance of the band at this wavelength occurs, which is associated with the disappearance of the oxirane bonds in the CADE monomer (Fig. 10A), whilst for the vinyl monomer TEGDVE the characteristic band appears at 1620 cm−1. During the photopolymerization process the disappearance of this band occurs, which is related to the disappearance of double bonds in the TEGDVE monomer (Fig. 10B). The photopolymerization of the CADE monomer was conducted in air, while the TEGDVE monomer was measured in the laminate.
 Fig. 10  FT-IR spectra before and after photopolymerization under the Vis-LED at 470 nm (12.7 mW cm−2) irradiation of the composition with B-IOD-PF6, with 3% w/w compound as the initiator: (A) for the CADE monomer and (B) for the TEGDVE monomer. The thickness of the sample was 25 μm. 
Firstly, the effect of the concentration of B-IOD-PF6 and B-IOD-SbF6 initiators on the efficiency of initiating the photopolymerization processes of the CADE monomer polymerization according to the cationic mechanism with ring opening during exposure to the LED@470 nm diode with an intensity on the sample of 12.7 mW cm−2 was examined. Compositions consisting of 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, 3.0%, and 5.0% by weight of B-IOD-PF6 and B-IOD-SbF6 were prepared. In Fig. 11 the polymerization profiles of CADE upon exposure to the LED@470 nm in the presence of B-IOD-PF6 and B-IOD-SBF6 is presented. Generally, it is observed that the higher the concentration of the B-IOD-PF6 initiator, the higher the degree of conversion. The use of 0.5% by weight and 1% by weight of the initiator does not affect the amount of conversion achieved. In the case of the use of 5% by wt. initiator, the plateau of the profile was not reached. In the case of the B-IOD-SbF6 initiator, the highest degree of conversion was achieved for a concentration of 3% by weight. In other cases, the conversion rates reached similar values. Such a low conversion at 5% by weight of this initiator may be due to its consumption. Therefore, further study compositions of the initiators at concentrations of 3% by weight were selected (Table 2).

The irradiation starts at t = 10 s. The thickness of the sample was 25 μm.

In the next step, the influence of the radiation source on the efficiency of initiating the B-IOD-PF6 initiator for photopolymerization processes of the CADE epoxy monomer was examined. Therefore, the indirect influence of the extinction coefficient on the photopolymerization rate and degree of conversion of B-IOD-PF6 and the epoxy CADE monomer and vinyl TEGDVE monomer was tested. The system was irradiated with 365 nm, 405 nm and 450 nm diodes with the same light intensity on the sample (22.8 mW cm−2) for 900 seconds. It was observed that the shortest induction time was recorded when the sample was exposed to light with a wavelength of 450 nm, which correlates with the highest molar extinction coefficient at this wavelength (Table 1). The highest induction time and the lowest polymerization rate were detected for the 365 nm diode, which correlates with the lowest extinction coefficient for the iodonium salt at this wavelength (Fig. 12A).
 Fig. 12  Polymerization profiles of CADE (epoxy function conversion vs. irradiation time) upon exposure to the LED@365 nm, LED@405 nm, and LED@450 nm in the presence of hexafluorophosphate 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (B-IOD-PF6) upon irradiation with (A) a constant current (22.8 mW cm−2) and (B) hexafluoroantimonate 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (B-IOD-SbF6) (on the right) upon different irradiation. The thickness of the sample was 25 μm. 
Real-time FT-IR measurements of compositions consisting of B-IOD-PF6 (3% by weight) with diodes of maximum intensity on the sample (Fig. 12B), 505 nm (7.9 mW cm−2), 365 nm (3.8 mW cm−2), and 470 nm (12.9 mW cm−2), respectively, were also studied. In each case, high conversions ranging from 57.2% for the 470 nm diode and intensity on the sample of 12.9 mW cm−2, to 79.0% for the 405 nm diode and intensity on the sample of 22.8 mW cm−2 were achieved. In addition, photoinitiators based on the B-1 chromophore can be used not only for initiating the photopolymerization processes but also as colorimetric sensors of the degree of photopolymerization. Before the cationic photopolymerization of the CADE monomer, the composition is green in colour (495–570 nm), but after the photopolymerization process the composition turns yellow (570–590 nm) (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  Color of the composition consisting of B-IOD-PF6 (3% w/w) and the CADE monomer before and after photopolymerization. 
Dark polymerization processes were also studied. The dark polymerization efficiency is an important parameter for the global performance of different initiating systems. For this purpose, the composition consisting of the B-IOD-PF6 initiator (3% by weight) and CADE monomer was irradiated with the same diodes of the same intensity as in the above studies (Fig. 12), with the difference that the diode was turned off 350 seconds after exposure. Under irradiation at different diodes (Fig. 13), using B-IOD-PF6, the dark polymerization has high efficiency. The photopolymerization of the CADE monomer proceeds after the light is switched off after 350 s of irradiation. For this photoinitiator, an increase in conversion of about 6% after just 900 seconds was observed.
 Fig. 13  Polymerization profiles of CADE (epoxy function conversion vs. irradiation time) upon exposure to the LED@365 nm, LED@405 nm, and LED@450 nm in the presence of hexafluorophosphate 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (B-IOD-PF6) upon irradiation with (A) a constant current (22.8 mW cm−2) and (B) hexafluoroantimonate 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (B-IOD-SbF6) (on the right) with different concentrations upon irradiation at 22.7 mW cm−2. The light was switched off after 350s. The irradiation starts at t = 10 s. The thickness of the sample was 25 μm. 
Dark polymerization for this composition occurs also when the diode at 505 nm (intensity 7.9 mW cm−2) is off, after 200, 300, 350, and 500 seconds. Nevertheless, after 100 seconds from switching off the diode, the dark polymerization not observed. The highest increase in conversion was recorded 200 seconds after the radiation source was turned off. It amounted to 7.5% (Fig. 14).
 Fig. 14  Polymerization profiles of CADE (epoxy function conversion vs. irradiation time) upon exposure to the LED@505 nm in the presence of hexafluorophosphate 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (B-IOD-PF6) upon irradiation at 7.9 mW cm−2. The light switched off after different times (100 s, 200 s, 300 s, 350 s, and 500 s). The irradiation starts at t = 10 s. 
The investigated photoinitiator B-IOD-PF6 was also tested for the cationic photopolymerization of the vinyl monomer. The B-IOD-PF6 initiator (3 w/w) is also very effective at initiating the cationic photopolymerization of the TEGDVE monomer. Thin samples of 0.25 mm in the laminate when exposed to a LED source with an emission at different diodes and different intensities of the sample were investigated using the real-time FT-IR method. Photopolymerization profiles are presented in Fig. 15. Fig. 15A presents the profiles for the composition upon exposure to the LED with emission at different diodes but the same intensity on the sample (12.9 mW cm−2). Fig. 15B presents the profiles for the composition when exposed to a LED with emission at different diodes and the maximum intensity on the sample (12.9 mW cm−2). The photopolymerization process of the TEGDVE monomer is very fast. In any case, very high conversion rates of up to 92% were obtained (Fig. 15 and Table 3).

The irradiation starts at t = 10 s. The thickness of the sample was 25 μm.

3.7. FT-IR research for BODIPY initiators with different anions
In the next step, the influence of anions in the iodonium salt based on BODIPY derivatives on the efficiency of the initiation of cationic photopolymerization processes of both the TEGDVE vinyl monomer and CADE epoxy monomer was investigated. It is very important because, in order to use the compound consisting of an onium salt, i.e., in the form of the iodonium salt, as a cationic photoinitiator of the photopolymerization processes, the anionic part of the onium salt must be non-nucleophilic. Otherwise, the creation of π bonds between anions and growing macrocations will lead to termination or completion of the photopolymerization process. That is why oniums (mainly iodonium), which have perfluorinated anions in their structure, are most often used as cationic photoinitiators, while the type of perfluorinated anion directly affects the strength of the proton acid photoinitiation. The strength of the acid produced affects the rate of initiation. Thus, the kinetics of the cationic photopolymerization reaction is strongly dependent on the anion that is built into the structure of the iodonium or sulfonium salt. The size of the anion and the electron density affect the rate of separation in the ion propagation pair. The larger the size of the anion, the lower its nucleophilicity and the higher the rate of photopolymerization propagation. The order of reactivity of perfluorinated anions is as follows:58BF4− < PF6− < AsF6− < SbF6− < B(C6F5)4− < Ga(C6F5)4−
Salts that contain anions such as Ī and C are not reactive. This is due to the fact that these anions are highly nucleophilic. On the other hand, salts containing nucleophilic tetrafluoroborate anions and hexafluorophosphate anions are often used for photopolymerization of epoxy monomers. However, for extremely reactive monomers, like vinyl ethers, the more nucleophilic triflates or perchlorate anions can also be used. Fig. 16 shows the results of the conversion of the CADE epoxy monomer and TEGDVE vinyl monomer, respectively, during the cationic photopolymerization process upon irradiation with light at 470 nm (1000 mA, which corresponds to 12.9 mW cm−2). Based on the registered kinetic profiles using the real time FT-IR method, it was shown that the B-IOD-SbF6 initiator is the most effective, because the SbF6− anion is the least nucleophilic (Table 4).

The irradiation starts at t = 10 s.

3.8. Research using the photo-DSC technique
The photo-DSC method allowed us to determine the initiation efficiency of new initiators during the photopolymerization process and thus determine the degree of conversion. This method involves measuring the heat flow from the sample during the process, and gives information about the relationship between the speed of the polymerization reaction and its time. The conversion rate was calculated as the ratio of the amount of total heat released in the composition before photopolymerization, corrected of given thermal effects (that do not result directly from the photopolymerization process), to the total quantity of heat of polymerization. The total amount of heat of polymerization corresponds to a 100% conversion rate. Using photo-DSC, the progress of photopolymerization of the sample consisting of B-IOD-PF6, (3 w/w) and oxetane monomers (1,4-bis[(3-etyl-3-oxiranylmethoxy)methyl]benzene OXT121, glycidyl (2-bis[4-(glycidyloxy)phenyl]propane BisGly) and 3,4-epoxy cyclohexylmethyl 3,4-epoxycyclohexanecarboxylate (CADE) were monitored. The oxetane monomers were characterized by low viscosity, while the glycidyl monomers were characterized by high viscosity, which makes applying the composition to the pellet or between the films difficult or impossible in the real-time-FT-IR technique. Therefore, a better solution is to carry out photopolymerization measurements using the photo-DSC method. The photopolymerization process was carried out in each case for 800 seconds (Fig. 17).

The dependence of the Rp polymerization rate on time was also determined (Fig. 17B), using eqn (4) to determine the kinetics of the photopolymerization process of various monomers with the B-IOD-PF6 initiator. The conversion ranged from 36.84% for the epoxy monomer to as much as 91.26% for the OXT121 oxetane monomer (Fig. 18). Based on research, it can be concluded that oxetane monomers are the most reactive, while glycidyl monomers are the least reactive (Table 5).

3.9. Performance of the 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indecene in the role of photosensitizers in bimolecular photoinitiating systems
The effectiveness of the one-component initiator system consisting of B-IOD-PF6 was also compared with that of the two-component system consisting of a chromophore as a co-initiator and the commercially available commonly used iodonium salt – Speedcure 938. In two-component systems, the initiation is the result of photosensitization. Photopolymerization sensitization is a process involving the transfer of energy between a photoinitiator, which can be e.g. an iodonium salt, and a photosensitizer. A sensitizer is a compound that absorbs electromagnetic radiation in the longer-term range compared to a photoinitiator. In this process, the photoinitiator plays the role of an electron acceptor, which it receives from the excited photosensitizer. The photosensitizer plays the role of an energy donor. As a result of energy transfer, the photoinitiator is excited, followed by classic photochemical relaxation. From the thermodynamic point of view, the singlet state electron transfer for a bimolecular photoinitiating system based on 4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indecene and Speedcure 938 is allowed (ΔGet (S) = −0.61 [eV]). However, a triplet transition is thermodynamically not allowed (delta G greater than zero) (Table 6).

On one hand, the initial triplet state absorbance decreases as a result of the addition of the iodonium salt to the B-1 co-initiator solution (Fig. 19). On the other hand, at singlet states, the electron transfer reaction between Speedcure 938 and the B-1 co-initiator was controlled by diffusion. This is due to the large directional coefficient in the Stern–Volmer equation (Fig. 20). Therefore, it is suggested that the singlet state pathway predominates as the formation of the triplet state (via intersystem crossing) is in competition with the quenching of the singlet state by iodonium.

Normally, approx. 0.1% by weight co-initiator and 1% iodonium salt are used for kinetic measurements. The measurement of the cationic photopolymerization of the TEGDVE monomer was performed using this system when exposed to diodes of different wavelengths and intensities on the sample. Then, the conversion achieved was very low (Fig. 21). However, in order to compare the initiation efficiency of a one-component system with a two-component system, compositions were prepared in such a way that the molar extinction coefficient at a given wavelength (corresponding to the diode used) was the same for the B-IOD-PF6 initiator and the B-1 chromophore (Fig. S104–107†). Then the degrees of conversion for B-IOD-PF6 and B-1 were very similar to each other (Table 7).

3.10. Investigation of photoinduced electron transfer
The results indicate that the chromophore 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indecene (B-1) can be used as a co-initiator in oxidation processes resulting in electron transfer from the excited state of this chromophore to the photoinitiator iodonium salt (Speedcure 938). On the other hand, these studies show that the investigated chromophore is efficient in the photoreduction process. In this case, there is an electron transfer from the amine (in this case ethyl 4-(dimethylamino)benzoate) to the excited state of the investigated chromophore B-1. Fig. 22 shows the kinetic profiles for the radical photopolymerization process upon LED irradiation at 470 nm for 3 different photoinitiating systems; chromophore and amine; chromophore and iodonium salt; and chromophore, amine and iodonium salt. It was then shown that chromophore B-1 can act as a two-component initiator system by both photoreduction and photooxidation processes. Nevertheless, the highest conversion rates were obtained for the ternary initiator system in the form of the chromophore iodonium salt amine. Despite the fact that it is not as good as the one-component initiator, it has the advantage that it can be used for work in the photoredox cycle (Fig. 22).

3.11. Experiment with the resolution test targets
In the next step, the composition consisting of B-IOD-PF6 (1% w/w) and TMPTA/DVE-2 (3:7 w/w) was irradiated by using an M405LP1 Vis-LED (1.4 A, from Thorlabs Inc., Tampa, FL, USA) emitting light with the wavelength at λmax = 405 nm and an intensity of 1200 mW cm−2. It was shown that this composition under the influence of high-power 405 nm diode radiation was cured within 30 seconds (Fig. 23 and 24). However, it was necessary to use a polypropylene film to prevent oxygen inhibition. Therefore, letter patterns with a small thickness (30 μm) were obtained (Fig. 23 and 24).

A slightly thicker pattern was obtained for the system consisting of B-IOD-PF6 (1% w/w) CADE/TMPTA upon irradiation through a mask for 1 minute (Fig. 25).

3.12. 3D printing experiment
Considering that photocurable 3D printing is becoming more and more popular, we also investigated photoinitiators based on BODIPY in 3D printing. For this purpose, we have chosen a mixture of two monomers in a weight ratio of 1:1. The first was the acrylate monomer TMPTA, and the second was the CADE epoxy monomer. Nevertheless, 3D printing from acrylate monomers themselves has a number of significant disadvantages. The main limitation of using acrylate resins in 3D printing is the high polymerization shrinkage and the stickiness of these resins. Based on the available literature, the solution to this problem is to use epoxy monomers for 3D printing, which polymerize according to the cationic mechanism. We believe that the connection of two monomers that polymerize by both radical and cationic mechanisms will allow us to obtain 3D prints with good resolution and would be effective and bring many benefits in 3D printing. Fig. 26 and 27 show objects obtained by 3D printing by irradiating the composition with a laser with a maximum emission at a wavelength of 405 nm. The composition consisted of the initiator B-IOD-PF6 (1% w/w) and the mixture of TMPTA/CADE monomers in a 1:1 weight ratio. In the case of the irradiated area (WIiTCh logo), a slightly thinner (1 mm) pattern was obtained. In the case of the letter B, the obtained pattern was already about 2 mm thick. Thus, in this 3D printing experiment, prints with good spatial resolution in a remarkably short time were obtained. The only limitation of the spatial resolution is the size of the laser beam, which is a spot with a diameter of 50 μm. In addition, it is worth noting that the obtained patterns fluoresce when exposed to a UV-LED with a maximum emission of 366 nm (Fig. 26D and Fig. 27D).

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the study revealed that the tested photoinitiators based on the B-1 chromophore showed different efficiencies of the photoinitiation of cationic photopolymerization. The type of anion in the photoinitiator affects the efficiency of the initiation of cationic photopolymerization. Compound hexafluoroantimonate phenyl[4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene]iodonium (B-IOD-SbF6) shows the highest reactivity due to the most nucleophilic character of the anion. Nevertheless, the new photoinitiators are effective photoinitiators for cationic photopolymerization processes. These initiators efficiently initiate the polymerization process of monomers such as epoxides, ethers, glycidyls and also oxetanes. They are also suitable for photopolymerization of hybrid monomers: divinyl/triacrylate and diepoxide/triacrylate. As a light source it is possible to use diodes of wide spectrum, with the emission maximum in the range of 365–490 nm. The applicability of the new photoinitiators was also investigated: with 3D printing epoxy and acrylic resins, patterns with very good resolution were obtained. Moreover, photoinitiators based on the 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indecene chromophore can be used not only for initiating the photopolymerization processes but also as a colorimetric sensor of the degree of photopolymerization. Before the cationic photopolymerization of the CADE monomer, the composition is green (495–570 nm), while after the photopolymerization process the composition is yellow (570–590 nm). In addition, the two-component system consists of the B-1 chromophore and the bis-(4-t-butylphenyl)-iodonium hexafluorophosphate (Speedcure 938) can be used for photopolymerization of the vinyl monomer. Despite the fact that it is not as good as the one-component initiator, it can be used for work in the photoredox cycle.
