    , Accepted 6th April 2018First published on 6th April 2018AbstractNa–air batteries have received significant attention as possible candidates for alternative battery systems due to their high specific energy density (1683 W h kg−1). However, the undesirable sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limit the practicality of the production of rechargeable Na–air batteries. Recently, pyrochlore oxides (A2B2O7) have received great attention as effective bifunctional electrocatalysts. However, the comprehensive understanding of catalytic activity with the development of new pyrochlore catalysts is unsatisfactory due to the limited use of B-site cations. Here, we report the use of a novel nanocrystalline bismuth rhodium oxide (Bi2Rh2O6.8) crystal with a pyrochlore structure as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. Moreover, the surface of Bi2Rh2O6.8 was modified via phosphate-ion functionalization (P-Bi2Rh2O6.8) to enhance its surface chemical reactivity, resulting in fast and efficient charge transfer with high ORR and OER activities. During electrocatalysis, the functionalized H2PO4− ion can not only significantly enhance the surface reactivity for a fast and efficient electron/charge-transfer reaction but also facilitate the oxidation of Bi and Rh ions and boost the electron donation by improving the electron transport. Finally, the first successful translation of the bifunctional electrocatalytic activities of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 to a practical device, an aqueous Na–air battery, was demonstrated.
The recent rapid development of technologies for renewable energy harvesting (e.g., wind and solar energy) causes the need for effective energy conversion and storage devices to meet the cyclic energy production of renewable sources and the challenges of increasing energy demand.1,2 Among the diverse electrical energy storage systems (EESs), metal–air batteries are focused on as promising candidates for novel electrical energy storage technologies because of their outstanding power and energy density performance.3 Especially, the mixed aprotic/aqueous (referred to as “aqueous”) sodium–air (Na–air) batteries have great attention compared with non-aqueous Na–air batteries considering the side reaction and round-trip efficiency. In a non-aqueous electrolyte, the discharge product is an insoluble and nonconductive metal oxide that is easily deposited in the pores of the air electrode, thereby progressively covering active reaction sites and blocking O2 diffusion pathways. This leads to the degradation of the air electrode and of the battery performance as well. However, in an aqueous electrolyte, highly water-soluble sodium hydroxide is the discharge product, which reduces electrode clogging and electrical conductivity deterioration. This behavior enables full cell discharge, resulting in enhancement of cell performance.4,5 However, the undesirable sluggish kinetics of electrocatalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limit the practical production of rechargeable Na–air batteries.6,7 To date, a wide range of ORR and OER electrocatalysts, including metal oxide, nonprecious metal, metal free-based materials, have been reported for highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts.8–17 Among these various electrocatalysts, metal oxides are spotlighted as a promising electrocatalysts due to their catalytic activity and structural stability, and they demonstrate comparable ORR and OER characteristics with those of the current, state-of-the-art Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts.18–22
Along with metal oxide-based materials, pyrochlore oxides (A2B2O7), such as Pb2Ru2O7−x,23 Bi2.4Ru1.6O7,24 Pb2[Ru2−xPbx4+]O6.5,25 Bi2[Ru2−xBix]O7−y,26 Bi2Ru2O7,27,28 and Pb2Ru2O6.5,29 have been widely investigated for obtaining high ORR and OER activities. The chemical bonding nature and electronic environment of A and B site cations can determine the metallic conduction behaviors of pyrochlore oxides, resulting in high electrical conductivity and catalytic activity.30 However, previous studies on B-site cations were limited to Ru4+ ions, which limits the understanding of the pyrochlore structure.23–29 Therefore, research studies using additional B-site cations could help identify the catalytic mechanism of pyrochlore oxide. For example, Rh4+ cations, which have a similar ionic radius to Ru4+, can be considered as a new B-site cation of the A2B2O7 pyrochlore oxide. In addition, along with the Rh4+ for the B-site cation, Bi3+ ions are promising candidates for determining the A-site cation of the A2Rh2O7 pyrochlore oxide because of the similar Pauling electronegativity values of Rh (2.28) and Bi (2.02). The similarity of the A-site Bi ion and B-site Rh ion Pauling electronegativities results in a largely covalent bond between Rh–O–Rh/Bi, which results in long-range order delocalization of the shared electrons throughout the Rh–O–Rh/Bi covalent bonds.30 The delocalization of electrons in Bi2Rh2O6.8 allows for a quick response to the charge-transfer reactions during the OER and ORR. Owing to these desirable characteristics, the development of Bi2Rh2O6.8 as novel electrocatalyst provides a good opportunity to clarify the pyrochlore structures and their catalytic origin. However, the limited surface chemical reactivity of this pyrochlore oxide hinders its electrocatalytic activity. Therefore, it is challenging to tailor the surface reactivity of pyrochlore oxides to fully realize their catalytic potential.
Herein, phosphate ion (H2PO4−) functionalized bismuth rhodium oxide pyrochlore (P-Bi2Rh2O6.8) nanoparticles are synthesized as highly active and stable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for use in air electrodes in rechargeable aqueous Na–air batteries. In a recent study, the Xia group reported that phosphate ion functionalization of Co3O4 nanosheet surfaces greatly enhanced the surface reactivity for fast and efficient faradaic reactions, which led to significantly enhanced pseudo-capacitive performance for pseudocapacitors.31 In addition, the Lee group reported that phosphate doping of BiVO4 enhanced its photo-electrochemical water oxidation activity by significantly improving its charge-transfer properties.32 Considering these results, we expect that the functionalized phosphate ion can significantly improve the surface chemical reactivity of Bi2Rh2O6.8, facilitating effective charge transfer to achieve high ORR and OER activities. As expected, the fabricated P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 shows highly effective bifunctional catalytic activity in an alkaline medium. The P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 exhibits an oxygen electrode activity of 0.67 V (the potential difference between the ORR and OER potential at a current density of −3 and 10 mA cm−2, respectively), which is significantly lower than those of Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts. The high catalytic activity of the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 can be explained by the enhanced covalent character provided by the functionalization with phosphate ions, resulting in a more favorable oxidation nature of the Bi and Rh ions. Significantly, an aqueous Na–air battery employing a P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 air cathode was firstly developed and presented superior round trip efficiency compared to that of Ir/C- and Pt/C-based cells with high power density and cycle stability.
The preparation method of the phosphate ion functionalized nanocrystalline pyrochlore oxide of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The Bi2Rh2O6.8 was synthesized via a sol–gel method using the uniformly cross-linked Bi3+ and Rh4+ ions with citric acid (C6H8O7) as a chelating agent.30 The prepared cross-linked precursor particles were crystallized at 1350 °C to generate single crystalline Bi2Rh2O6.8 nanoparticles. Finally, the Bi2Rh2O6.8 nanoparticles were treated with ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH4H2PO4) in order to functionalize the phosphate ions (H2PO4−) on the surface. Fig. S1† presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Bi2Rh2O6.8, indicating the cubic phase crystal structure with the space group of Fdm symmetry. Clearly, the XRD diffraction peaks of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 were also well-indexed to the cubic phase, indicating that no phase transformation occurred during surface functionalization. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, Fig. S2†) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Fig. 1(b)) images of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 show that irregular polyhedral shapes of nanoparticles of the pyrochlore aggregated, which are below 200 nm in size. Fig. 1(c) presents the X-ray spectrometry (EDS) mapping images for P-Bi2Rh2O6.8, showing the uniform distributions of Bi, Rh, O, and P throughout the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 nanoparticles. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 along the [1 1 0] main zone axis represents the cubic phases of the pyrochlore structure, which is consistent with the unit spots of (−1 1 −1) and (−1 1 1) (Fig. 1(d)). In addition, as shown in Fig. 1(e), the lattice interlayer distances are 0.51 and 0.59 nm and correspond to the (0 0 2) and (1 1 1) diffraction planes, respectively. Similarly, Fig. 1(f) shows the SAED pattern for P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 along the [1 1 1] main zone axis, indicating a typical cubic phase response with the unit spots of (0 −2 2) and (−2 0 2), with the d-spacing value of 0.36 nm for the (0 2 2) and (2 2 0) crystal planes (Fig. 1(g)). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to investigate the surface functionalization of Bi2Rh2O6.8. Fig. S3(a) and (b)† show the O 1s core-level XPS spectra of both Bi2Rh2O6.8 and P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 samples, with one strong peak centered at 530.2 eV, corresponding to the Rh–O and Bi–O bond, and a small peak at 533.2 eV, arising from the multiplicity of the chemically and physically bound water at the Bi2Rh2O6.8 and P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 surfaces. The shoulder peak observed at 531.36 eV for Bi2Rh2O6.8 is associated with the hydroxyl groups (–OH) on the surface; however, for the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 sample, the shoulder peak is observed at 531.58 eV, which arises from the oxygen species of the H2PO4− ion.33 This substitution of hydroxyl groups to H2PO4− ions indicates the successful phosphate ion functionalization of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 during NH4H2PO4 treatment. Further evidence of phosphate ion functionalization can be observed by confirming the existence of H2PO4− ions in the P 2p core-level XPS spectra of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 (Fig. S3(c) and (d)†).34

For potential application as a bifunctional catalyst in the air-cathode of Na–air batteries, the electrocatalytic activity of the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 catalyst toward the ORR and OER was evaluated in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution by rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements. For comparison, the bifunctional electrocatalytic activities of Ir/C and Pt/C were also examined to identify a catalyst activity benchmark for the OER and ORR, respectively. The ORR activity of the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 and Bi2Rh2O6.8 catalysts were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in O2- and N2-saturated solutions. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and S4,† the cathodic reduction peaks are apparent in the O2-saturated KOH solution, which can be ascribed to the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction on the electrode. The P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 catalyst shows a more positive ORR peak potential (∼0.81 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) than the Bi2Rh2O6.8 (∼0.76 V) and shows higher cathodic current densities, indicating more effective ORR activity. Fig. 2(b) shows the ORR linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) polarization curves of the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 catalyst, demonstrating an onset potential of ∼0.93 V and a limiting current density of −5.846 mA cm−2, which are higher than those for Bi2Rh2O6.8 (∼0.87 V and −5.458 mA cm−2, respectively). In addition, the reduction potential at a current density of −3 mA cm−2 for the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 catalyst (0.846 V) is higher than that of the Bi2Rh2O6.8 catalyst (0.797 V), representing the favorable oxygen reduction behavior for the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 catalyst. Although the reduction and onset potentials of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 are still more negative compared to those of Pt/C, the ORR activity of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 is comparable to previously reported nonnoble, metal-based electrocatalysts (Table S1†). To gain a deeper insight into the ORR activity, LSV curves were obtained at different rotation speeds ranging from 400 to 3200 rpm at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Fig. S5† clearly shows that the limiting current density increases with the increase of rotation speed. The electron transfer number (n) for the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8, Bi2Rh2O6.8, and Pt/C catalysts can be determined from the slopes of the Koutecky–Levich (KL) plots (Fig. S6†) at various potentials (Fig. 2(c)). The P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 exhibits an n value ranging from 3.76 to 3.88 over the potential range, which is similar to that of the Pt/C catalyst (n: 3.83–3.91), indicating that the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 exhibits favorable four-electron reduction in the ORR process.

ORR polarization curves of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8, Bi2Rh2O6.8, Pt/C and Ir/C in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH (rotation rate: 1600 rpm, scan rate: 10 mV s−1). (c) Electron transfer number of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8, Bi2Rh2O6.8 and Pt/C at different potentials. (d) OER polarization curves of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8, Bi2Rh2O6.8, Pt/C and Ir/C in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH (rotation rate: 1600 rpm, scan rate: 10 mV s−1). (e) Tafel plots of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8, Bi2Rh2O6.8 and Ir/C. (f) The overall polarization curves of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8, Bi2Rh2O6.8, Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts within the ORR and OER potential window (the inset illustrates the comparison of the oxygen electrode activity of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8, Bi2Rh2O6.8, Pt/C and Ir/C). 
The OER activities of the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8, Bi2Rh2O6.8, Pt/C, and Ir/C catalysts were investigated by examination of the anodic polarization curves, which were measured in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm. Although the OER was initiated at a slightly higher potential, the Bi2Rh2O6.8 catalyst exhibits similar overpotentials to those of the Ir/C at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (0.44 and 0.37 V). After phosphate ion functionalization, the overpotential of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 corresponding to the 10 mA cm−2 current density significantly decreased to 0.28 V, which is much lower than that of the Ir/C catalyst, indicating improved OER catalytic activity (Fig. 2(d)). The Tafel slope was obtained from the Tafel equation (η = a + blog|J|, where η, b and J are the overpotential, Tafel slope and current density, respectively) using the OER polarization curves.35 As shown in Fig. 2(e), P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 exhibits the smallest Tafel slope (67 mV dec−1) compared to those of the Ir/C (80 mV dec−1) and Bi2Rh2O6.8 (113 mV dec−1) catalysts, indicating the desirable fast OER kinetics of phosphate ion functionalized Bi2Rh2O6.8. Fig. 2(f) shows the overall ORR and OER catalytic activities for the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8, Bi2Rh2O6.8, Pt/C, and Ir/C catalysts obtained by calculating the potential difference between the ORR and the OER potential at a current density of −3 and 10 mA cm−2, respectively (ΔE = EOER,J10 − EORR,J-3).36 A more desirable bifunctional catalyst is characterized by a lower ΔE value. As shown in Fig. 2(f), P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 shows the smallest ΔE value (0.67 V) compared to Bi2Rh2O6.8 (0.87 V), Ir/C (0.97 V) and Pt/C (1.02 V) catalysts, representing its outstanding oxygen electrode activity. The ΔE value for P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 is comparable or even much lower compared with the previously reported bifunctional electrocatalysts such as perovskite oxides and pyrochlore oxides, indicating superior bifunctional catalytic activity (Table S2†).
To investigate the origin of the high ORR and OER catalytic activity of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8, the oxidation state of the Bi and Rh ions in the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 catalyst was analyzed by ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Fig. S7† shows the normalized Rh K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of Rh metal and Rh2O3, Bi2Rh2O6.8, and P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 catalysts. In both Bi2Rh2O6.8 and P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 spectra, the peak at the photon energy of 23233 eV is attributed to the bound of dipole-allowed transition from Rh 1s to 5p states and the peak located at 23242 eV is assigned to the continuum.37 In addition, Fig. S8† shows the Bi LIII-edge XANES spectra of Bi2Rh2O6.8, and P-Bi2Rh2O6.8, which exhibit intense peaks located at 13444 eV that can be associated with the dipole-allowed transition from Bi 1s to 6p states.38 After completion of the ORR, the peaks of the Rh K-edge and Bi LIII-edge XANES spectra of the Bi2Rh2O6.8, and P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 shifted to higher photon energy values, indicating that the oxidation states of the B-site Rh ions and A-site Bi ions increased (Fig. 3(a) and (b)).39 In the same manner, the Rh and Bi ions were also oxidized during the OER as indicated by the peak shift to higher photon energies (Fig. 3(d) and (e)). Importantly, P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 exhibits a more positive peak shift of photon energies than that of Bi2Rh2O6.8 during the ORR and OER process, representing the higher degree of oxidation of the Bi and Rh ions in P-Bi2Rh2O6.8. Therefore, the more favorable oxidation nature of Bi and Rh ions in P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 occurred during the ORR and OER leading to high bifunctional catalytic activity. The functionalized phosphate ions greatly improve the surface reactivity, resulting in differences in the oxidation degree of the A and B site ions in the Bi2Rh2O6.8 pyrochlore oxide. The reactivity of the materials can be determined by their chemical bonds and the corresponding electronic environment of the metal site.40 Therefore, the covalent character of chemical bonds can be obtained based on eqn (1):31 Covalent character (%) = 100 × exp[−0.25(Xa − Xb)2](1)where Xa and Xb are the Pauling electronegativity values of the anion and cation, respectively. Since the Pauling electronegativity values of Bi, Rh, –OPO(OH)2, and O are 2.02, 2.28, 3.13, and 3.44, respectively, the covalent character of the Rh–O and Rh–OPO(OH)2 bonds were calculated to be 71.43% and 83.47%, respectively, and that of the Bi–O and Bi–OPO(OH)2 bonds were 60.4% and 73.48%, respectively. Therefore, P-Bi2Rh2O6.8, which contains Bi–OPO(OH)2 and Rh–OPO(OH)2 bonds, has a higher covalent character than Bi2Rh2O6.8. The more dominant covalent character of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 indicates the higher degree of covalency, representing that the electrons in the 4d orbitals of Rh and 6p orbitals of Bi have higher energies. Furthermore, the smaller electronegativity values of –OPO(OH)2 than elemental O resulted in a weaker attraction of the electrons in the 4d orbitals of the Rh cations and 6p orbitals of the Bi cations in P-Bi2Rh2O6.8. Therefore, oxidation of the Rh and Bi ions in P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 was easily achieved because less energy is required to extract electrons during the ORR and OER, resulting in the fast catalyst kinetics and improved surface reactivity of the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8.

Fig. S9† shows the O K-edge XANES spectra of Bi2Rh2O6.8 and P-Bi2Rh2O6.8, with a number of holes in the t2g orbital (the peak at the photon energy of 525.3 eV) and eg orbital (the peak located at 528.4 eV) of Rh 4d.41 The higher intensity of the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 peaks indicate more significant covalent Rh-O bonding characteristics because the higher covalent character of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 results in larger hole density in the O 2p orbital by strong hybridization between O 2p and Rh 4d orbitals.30 To quantify the covalency of the Rh–O bonds of the Bi2Rh2O6.8 and P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 catalysts, the degree of covalency (Fig. S10†) was calculated using eqn (2):42 (2)
The absorbance of Rh covalency, which represents the excitations of O 1s to the Rh 4d–O 2p bands, was obtained by the integration of the difference between the pre-edge peak and fitted linear background.42–44 The P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 catalyst exhibits a much higher degree of covalency value (0.73) than the Bi2Rh2O6.8 (0.64), metallic Pb2Ru2O6.5 (0.65),30 and insulating Sm2Ru2O7 (0.39)30 catalysts. These results indicate that the surface of the phosphate ion functionalized Bi2Rh2O6.8 has covalent Rh–O bonds due to strong hybridization between the Rh 4d and O 2p orbitals, which results in enhanced electrocatalytic activities. Fig. 3(c) and (f) illustrates the origin of the catalytic activity of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8, showing oxidation of the Bi and Rh ions in P-Bi2Rh2O6.8. During electrocatalysis, the reaction proceeded by first oxidizing the cations and then donating the electrons simultaneously. During the oxidation, the functionalized H2PO4− ions can facilitate the oxidation of Bi and Rh ions and boost the electron donation by improving the electron transport. Further, with rapid movement, the donated electrons can easily reach the surface and inner layers, with a low-resistance pathway during the OER and ORR.39
To examine the potential applications of Na–air batteries, the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 pyrochlore oxides were coated onto carbon paper and incorporated into an air cathode. Fig. 4(a) shows the rechargeable aqueous Na–air battery configuration, which consisted of a Na metal anode in 1 M NaCF3SO3/TEGDME electrolyte solution and a catalyst-coated carbon paper air cathode in 0.1 M NaOH aqueous electrolyte solution separated by NASICON solid electrolyte.5 The charge/discharge mechanism of the Na–air battery is as follows; in the discharge process, Na+ ions are formed by the oxidation of Na metal and the Na+ ions were transported into NaOH, and the ORR occurs at the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8-coated air electrode by reducing O2 to OH−.45 In the charge process, Na+ ions were transported into the anode side and reduced to be deposited as Na metal, while the OER occurs at the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8-coated air electrode.46 Therefore, the overall charge/discharge reaction can be described as 4Na (s) + 2H2O (l) + O2 (g) ↔ 4NaOH (aq), with a calculated theoretical cell voltage of 3.11 V. However, allowing for the pH of the 0.1 M NaOH aqueous electrolyte solution, the theoretical voltage of the cell is calculated as Ecell = 3.17 V.47Fig. 4(b) presents the typical charge/discharge profile of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8, Ir/C, Pt/C and bare carbon paper at a current density of 0.01 mA cm−2. Although there is a gap between charge/discharge curves and the theoretical voltage value (∼3.17 V) of the Na–air cells, the cell with the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 catalyst showed the best charge/discharge behavior of all catalysts tested. Based on the charge/discharge profile, the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 air cathode exhibits the lowest overpotential gap (0.17 V) and highest round trip efficiency (94.9%) compared to the cell with bare carbon paper (0.72 V, 79.1%), Ir/C (0.32 V, 90.2%) and Pt/C (0.21 V, 93.6%) due to the highly desirable bifunctional activity of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 (Fig. S11†). The cycling stability for catalysts was investigated by performing a charge–discharge measurement up to 50 cycles at a current density of 0.01 mA cm−2. As shown in Fig. 4(c) and S12,† no significant drop or change in the terminated charge–discharge voltage or round trip efficiency was observed, representing the excellent cycling stability of the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 air electrode. The rate capability of the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 air electrode was also investigated by applying various current densities (from 0.01 to 0.05 mA cm−2) during the charge/discharge process (Fig. 4(d)). Importantly, along with a fivefold increase in the current density, the Na–air cell with the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 catalyst exhibits the lowest drop of the round trip efficiency compared to those of the other catalysts (Fig. 4(e)), indicating the outstanding rate capability of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8. The rate performance of the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 air electrode was further investigated by increasing the current densities step by step from 0.01 mA cm−2 to 0.02, 0.03, and 0.05 mA cm−2 for 50 cycles. As shown in Fig. S13,† the round-trip efficiency for the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 air electrode steadily decreased with the increase of current densities. After the high-rate cycles, the current density returned to 0.01 mA cm−2, and the round-trip efficiency recovers to 94.2%, indicating excellent rate performance. In addition, the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8-based cell was found to deliver a maximum specific power density of 181.2 mW g−1 at a current density of 120 mA g−1 (Fig. 4(f)). Table S3† summarizes the electrochemical performance of the P-Bi2Rh2O6.8-based Na–air battery with other previously reported non-aqueous/aqueous Na–air batteries, representing the superior round-trip efficiency, power density, cycling stability performance.

In conclusion, the phosphate ion functionalized Bi2Rh2O6.8 nanoparticles with a pyrochlore structure were successfully developed as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for use in Na–air batteries. The prepared P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 catalyst showed the smallest potential gap between the ORR and OER potential at the current density of −3 and 10 mA cm−2, respectively (ΔE = 0.67 V), indicating significantly enhanced bifunctional catalytic activities. The high catalytic activity of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 can be ascribed to its enhanced covalent character through functionalization with phosphate ions and to the covalency of the Rh–O bonds in Bi2Rh2O6.8. The high degree of covalency causes weaker attraction of the electrons in the 4d orbitals of Rh cations and 6p orbitals of Bi cations in P-Bi2Rh2O6.8, which leads to the increased oxidation activity of the Rh and Bi ions during the ORR and OER. Consequentially, we achieved a highly improved electrochemical performance of the rechargeable aqueous Na–air battery by using a P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 air cathode with a high round-trip efficiency and power density with excellent cycling stability. We strongly believe that the use of pyrochlore oxides with surface modification reveals new possibilities for the development of highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts for electrochemical applications such as in metal air batteries and fuel cells.
