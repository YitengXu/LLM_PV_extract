    AbstractFine BiVO4 particles with a tetragonal scheelite structure (s-t) were synthesized from Bi2O3 and V2O5 in an aqueous acetic acid solution. The crystal phase of BiVO4 changed from s-t to monoclinic scheelite structure (s-m) by calcination at 673 K. The fine BiVO4 photocatalysts showed O2 evolution from an aqueous silver nitrate solution and methylene blue decoloration under visible light irradiation. BiVO4(s-m) electrodes were readily prepared by pasting the obtained fine BiVO4(s-t) particles on FTO plates and subsequently calcining at 673 K. The BiVO4 electrode gave an excellent anodic photocurrent with 12% of an IPCE at 440 nm at 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. A wet photovoltaic cell consisting of the BiVO4 photoelectrode and a Pt counter electrode was constructed for water splitting. H2 and O2 evolved from water with an externally applied bias smaller than 1.23 V vs. the Pt counter electrode under visible light and simulated sunlight irradiation.
Introduction
Many studies on light energy conversion using semiconductor photoelectrodes have been conducted since the report of Honda-Fujishima effect.1–38 Photoelectrochemical water splitting has the advantage that H2 evolves separately from O2. Most photoelectrodes reported are stable metal oxides. Photoelectrodes such as TiO2,1–3,10 SrTiO3,4–6,14 BaTiO3,7 and KTaO38 have been reported for water splitting under UV irradiation. The TiO2 electrode requires an external bias to split water under UV irradiation, while SrTiO3, BaTiO3, and KTaO3 electrodes do not. It has also been reported that carbon and metal ion-doped TiO2,9,13 TiO2 thin film,31,36 metal ions-doped SrTiO3,13,15 Fe2O3,12,17,20,26,27,37 WO3,21,28,34 Cu2O,24 and BiVO429,32,38 electrodes respond to visible light. However, the number of electrode materials with visible-light-response for water splitting has been limited.
Many powdered photocatalysts with visible light response for H2 and O2 evolution from aqueous solutions have been developed.39 Even if powdered photocatalysts do not possess band potentials suitable for water splitting (the bottom of the conduction band < 0 V and the top of the valence band > 1.23 V vs. NHE at pH 0), water splitting may be achieved by application of these photocatalysts with visible-light-response to photoelectrodes by applying some external bias. Moreover, if water splitting proceeds under applying an external bias smaller than 1.23 V of a theoretical voltage needed for water splitting, H2 is able to be obtained by photon energy conversion. BiVO4 is one of the attractive materials for the photoelectrode, because BiVO4 is a highly active visible-light-driven photocatalyst for O2 evolution (apparent quantum yield: 9% at 450 nm).40 Sayama et al. reported water splitting using a BiVO4 thin film electrode with 1.6 V of an external bias.29 As far as the authors know, there are no reports about photon energy conversion using the BiVO4 electrode. Moreover, a simple preparation method of the photoelectrode is desired from a viewpoint of large-scale application of a photoelectrode system to realistic solar water splitting.
BiVO4 has three crystal systems; scheelite structure with monoclinic (s-m) and tetragonal (s-t) systems, and zircon structure with a tetragonal system (z-t).41–43 The conduction band and the valence band of the BiVO4 photocatalyst consist of V3d orbitals, and Bi6s and O2p hybrid orbitals, respectively. This band structure is the characteristic point of BiVO4, being difference from ordinary oxides which have valence bands consisting of only O2p orbital. Many synthesis methods of BiVO4 such as solid-state,42,44–46 aqueous process,40,43,47–49 hydrolysis,50 hydrothermal,51–56 and sonochemical methods57 have been reported. The crystal system and the shape of BiVO4 are able to be controlled by synthesis condition.40,43,49 Therefore, the improvement of photocatalytic activity and application of BiVO4 particles to a photoelectrode are expected by investigation of synthesis method.
In the present study, a new synthesis where fine BiVO4 particles were obtained from Bi2O3 and V2O5 in an aqueous acetic acid solution was developed. Photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical properties of the obtained BiVO4 were investigated. Water splitting was also demonstrated using a wet photovoltaic cell employing the BiVO4 electrode in order to explore the possibility of solar energy conversion reaction.
Experimental
Preparation of powdered BiVO4 photocatalysts
BiVO4 powders were prepared by a liquid-solid state reaction. Starting materials, 2.3 g of Bi2O3 (Kanto; 99.9%) and 0.9 g of V2O5 (Wako; 99%), were vigorously stirred in 0.5–2 mol L−1 of an aqueous acetic acid solution (50 mL) at room temperature for 1–11 days. The obtained BiVO4 powder was elaborately washed with distilled water to remove the acetic acid. The obtained BiVO4 powder was calcined at 373–773 K, if necessary. For the comparison, BiVO4 was also prepared by stirring Bi2O3 and V2O5 in an aqueous nitric acid solution (0.5 mol L−1) for 2 days.49 The obtained BiVO4 was denoted as (Concentration)(A: Acetic acid or N: Nitric acid)-BiVO4(Crystal form). For example, BiVO4 with scheelite structure with monoclinic system prepared in an aqueous acetic acid solution (1 mol L−1) was denoted as 1A-BiVO4(s-m) (Table S1, ESI†).
Characterization of powdered BiVO4 photocatalysts
The crystal form of obtained powder was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (Rigaku; MiniFlex). Diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained using a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer (JASCO; Ubest-570) and were converted from reflection to absorbance by the Kubelka–Munk method. The powders were observed using a scanning electron microscope (Jeol; JSM-6700F). Raman spectra were recorded using a Raman spectrometer (Jasco; NRS3200) with a semiconductor laser as an excitation source (785 nm).
Photocatalytic reactions
Photocatalytic O2 evolution reactions from aqueous AgNO3 and FeCl3 solutions were carried out in a gas-closed circulation system. BiVO4 power (0.3 g) was dispersed in an aqueous AgNO3 (50 mmol L−1) or FeCl3 (2 mmol L−1) solution (120 mL) in a top-irradiation cell with a Pyrex window. The pH of the aqueous FeCl3 solution was adjusted to 2.4 with H2SO4. The photocatalyst was irradiated with visible-light through a cutoff filter (Kenko, L42) from a 300 W Xe lamp (Parkin Elmer, CERMAX LX-300BUV). An amount of evolved O2 was determined with gas chromatography (TCD, MS-5A, Ar carrier gas).
Photocatalytic decoloration of methylene blue (MB) was carried out under 1 atm of air as a model reaction of treatment of water containing dyes. BiVO4 power (0.1 g) was dispersed in an aqueous MB solution (50 mL). About 40 μmol L−1 of an aqueous MB solution was employed for the photocatalytic decoloration of MB at the beginning of photo irradiation (at 0 h in Fig. 4) after saturation of MB adsorption on photocatalysts. A light source was a 300 W Xe lamp. Incident light was adjusted at 420 nm with a band-pass filter (Kenko, BP-42). The decoloration of the methylene blue was monitored by the absorbance at 664 nm using a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer.
Preparation of BiVO4 electrodes
50 mg of BiVO4 powders, 50 μL of acetylacetone (Kanto; 99.5%), and 150 μL of distilled water were mixed in an agate mortar. BiVO4 electrodes were prepared by pasting the mixture on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) transparent electrodes, and subsequent calcination at 373–773 K for 2 h in air.
Photoelectrochemical reactions
Photoelectrochemical properties were evaluated using a potentiostat (Hokuto denko; HZ-3000) with a three-electrode cell consisting of the BiVO4 electrode, a Pt electrode, and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. 0.1 mol L−1 of an aqueous K2SO4 solution was used as an electrolyte. The working electrode was irradiated from the FTO side with visible-light through a cutoff filter (L42) from a 300 W Xe lamp (Parkin Elmer, CERMAX LX-300BUV). A 300 W Xe lamp (ASAHI SPECTRA; MAX–301) with band-pass filters was employed for IPCE measurement. The number of incident photons was measured using a photodiode head (OPHIRA; PD300-UV) and a power monitor (NOVA). IPCE was calculated as follows.[IPCE/%] = 1240 × [Photocurrent density/μA cm−2]/([Wavelength/nm] × [Photo flux/W m−2])
Photoelectrochemical water splitting was carried out applying an external bias using a two-electrode cell consisting of a BiVO4 working electrode and a Pt counter electrode. The light sources were a 300 W Xe lamp (Parkin Elmer, CERMAX LX-300BUV) with a cut-off filter (Kenko, L42) and a solar simulator AM−1.5 (Peccell Technologies; PEC-L11). The evolved H2 and O2 were determined with gas chromatography. Solar energy conversion efficiency was calculated as follows.[Solar energy conversion efficiency/%] = 100 × [△G0(H2O)/J mol−1] × (1.23 – Eapply/1.23) × [Rate of H2 evolution/mol h−1] / (3600 × [Solar energy (AM1.5)/W cm−2] × [Dimension of electrode/cm2])
Results and discussion
Effects of acetic acid concentration and preparation time on crystal forms of obtained BiVO4
Starting materials, Bi2O3 and V2O5, were stirred in 0.5–2 mol L−1 of an aqueous acetic acid solution at room temperature for 1–11 days. XRD patterns of obtained Bi–V compounds were shown in Fig. 1. At low concentration and short stirring time (Fig. 1-(a) and (b)), the patterns of BiO(CH3COO) and V2O5 were only observed. In contrast, pure BiVO4(s-t) was obtained by stirring in 1 mol L−1 and in 2 mol L−1 of aqueous acetic acid solutions for 11 days and 9 days, respectively. BiVO4(s-t) was obtained by using an aqueous acetic acid solution, while BiVO4(s-m) was obtained by using an aqueous nitric acid solution as reported in the previous paper.49 This result suggested that the obtained crystal phases were changed depending on the kinds of acid, and that the concentration of an aqueous acetic acid solutions equal to or higher than 1 mol L−1 was required to obtain BiVO4(s-t). The authors have previously reported that the BiVO4(z-t) and BiVO4(s-t) powders were produced at the early stage of the preparation in strongly and weakly acidic conditions, respectively.43,49 Because BiVO4 particles formed through dissolution and precipitation processes from starting materials, concentrations and chemical species of Bi(III) and V(V) depending on pH affected the obtained crystal phase of BiVO4. Fig. 2 shows SEM images of BiVO4 prepared in aqueous acetic and nitric acid solutions. The particle sizes of each BiVO4 prepared in aqueous acetic acid solutions (< 200 nm) were smaller than those prepared in an aqueous nitric acid solution. Moreover, the 2A-BiVO4(s-t) was slightly smaller than 1A-BiVO4(s-t). It is considered that the acetic acid molecules worked as a protective group against crystal growth of BiVO4 particles by coordination to Bi3+ and V5+ ions. The difference in the XRD patterns between BiVO4(s-m) and BiVO4(s-t) is able to be judged by splitting of peaks at around 18.5° and 35° of 2 theta. Although the peak around 35° was singlet before calcination as shown in Fig. 1-(c) and (d), it split after calcination at 673 K for 5h as shown in Fig. 1-(c′) and (d′), indicating that the crystal form of BiVO4 was changed from s-t to s-m by calcination. Although the peak around 18.5° in Fig. 1-(c′) and (d′) should also split as shown in Fig. 1-(e), they seemed as a singlet probably due to the low crystallinity of BiVO4(s-m) prepared using aqueous acetic acid solutions. Therefore, the calcined A-BiVO4(s-t) sample can be denoted as A-BiVO4(s-m). The 0.5 N-BiVO4(s-m) sample was made up of single-crystal-like particles with clear faces (Fig. 2-(c)), whereas A-BiVO4(s-m) was a spherical particle without clear faces (Fig. 2-(a′) and (b′)). The particles of A-BiVO4(s-m) were slightly grown by calcination. The band gap absorption of 1A-BiVO4(s-m) was blue-shifted than that of 0.5 N-BiVO4(s-m). The band gap for 1A-BiVO4(s-m) was estimated to be 2.5 eV as shown in Fig. 3. The authors have reported that the band gap for BiVO4 prepared by hydrothermal synthesis became wider due to the change in the contribution of Bi to valence band by distortion of local structures.53 The change in the contribution of Bi can be known from shifts of Raman spectra. There were no shifts in the Raman spectra between 0.5 N-BiVO4(s-m) and 1A-BiVO4(s-m), indicating that there was no difference in the distortion of local structures (Fig. S1, ESI†). Therefore, it was considered that the blue shift as shown in Fig. 3 was due to a quantum size effect by the formation of fine crystals. Thus, the fine BiVO4(s-m) particles were able to be obtained using an aqueous acetic acid solution process.

Photocatalytic activities of BiVO4 prepared in acetic acid solutions

Table 1 shows photocatalytic O2 evolution over BiVO4 from aqueous solutions containing AgNO3 and FeCl3 under visible light irradiation. Although all BiVO4 showed photocatalytic activities for O2 evolution, the activities of A-BiVO4(s-m) were lower than that of N-BiVO4(s-m). This difference in activities was due to lower crystallinity of A-BiVO4(s-m) than N-BiVO4(s-m). The particles with the low crystallinity were rich in recombination sites. Therefore, the number of photogenerated electrons and holes decreased before reaching reaction sites on the surface. The exposed surfaces would also affect the activities. The edge surfaces of the plate-like and well-crystallized particle of N-BiVO4(s-m) as shown in Fig. 2 (c) are highly active sites for a photocatalytic oxidation reaction. Such well-crystallized surface was lack in the spherical A-BiVO4(s-m) particles as shown in Fig. 2-(a) and (b).

Fig. 4 shows photocatalytic MB decoloration over 2A-BiVO4(s-t), 2A-BiVO4(s-m), and 0.5N-BiVO4(s-m). It has been reported that the dye was degraded by electron injection from the dye to TiO2, when the dye was excited by incident light.58 Therefore, the author employed the monochromatic light at 420 nm for this experiment because this monochromatic light can excite only BiVO4 (Fig. S2, ESI†). The MB was not degraded in the absence of BiVO4 under the monochromatic light irradiation, indicating that the photochemical decoloration of MB did not proceed. The amounts of MB adsorbed on 2A-BiVO4(s-t) and 2A-BiVO4(s-m) were much larger than that on 0.5N-BiVO4(s-m) in the dark as shown in Fig. 4, because 2A-BiVO4(s-t) and 2A-BiVO4(s-m) had larger surface areas due to smaller particle sizes than 0.5N-BiVO4(s-m). We had made the MB adsorption almost saturate on all BiVO4 samples before photo irradiation. Therefore, the decrease in the concentration of MB under the monochromatic light irradiation was due to not adsorption but photocatalytic decoloration. All BiVO4 showed photocatalytic activities for the MB decoloration under visible light irradiation. Among them, 0.5N-BiVO4(s-m) showed the highest activity even if it possessed a poor adsorption property for MB. There was no relationship between the adsorption property and the photocatalytic decoloration. This result reflected the intrinsic photocatalytic activity of BiVO4 for the MB decoloration, not predominated by the adsorption property.

The order of activities for MB decoloration agreed well with that for O2 evolution. However, the difference between the rates of MB decoloration over 2A-BiVO4(s-m) and 0.5N-BiVO4(s-m) was not drastic compared with that between the rates of O2 evolution over their photocatalysts. This is because the mechanism of O2 evolution is different from that of MB decoloration. The crystallinity of the photocatalyst and the active surfaces are important for photocatalytic O2 evolution by water oxidation, because the O2 evolution accompanied with 4-electron oxidation is a tough reaction. On the other hand, MB decoloration proceeds accompanied with oxidation not only by holes but also by an O2− radical. Thus, A-BiVO4(s-m) also showed a reasonable photocatalytic activity for the MB decoloration under visible light irradiation.
Photoelectrochemical properties of BiVO4 prepared in acetic acid solutions
BiVO4 electrodes were prepared by pasting the A-BiVO4(s-t) powders on an FTO plate and subsequently calcined at 373 K–773 K for 2 h. Fig. 5 shows XRD patterns and anodic photocurrent of BiVO4 electrodes at 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl under visible light irradiation. It has been reported that the crystal form of BiVO4 changes from s-t to s-m at 528 K.41,43 The BiVO4 electrode calcined at 373 K was pure s-t, judging from the singlet peak around 35°. When the BiVO4 electrode was calcined at 573 K, the peak around 35° slightly split and seemed to consist of three peaks. The existence of three peaks indicated that the BiVO4 electrode calcined at 573 K consisted of a mixture of s-t and s-m. The peak around 35° completely split after calcination at 673 K, indicating that the crystal form of BiVO4 electrode completely changed from s-t to s-m. This BiVO4 electrode calcined at 673 K (denoted as A-BiVO4(s-m) electrode) gave an excellent anodic photocurrent compared with that calcined at 373 K (denoted as A-BiVO4(s-t) electrode) as shown in Fig. 5. The order of BiVO4(s-m) > BiVO4(s-t) in the photocurrent density shown in Fig. 5 corresponded to the order in the photocatalytic activity for O2 evolution shown in Table 1 and the previous report.43 The anodic photocurrent is affected by not only the intrinsic photocatalytic property but also the contact among particles of BiVO4 and an FTO substrate. That contact is a significant factor for a photoelectrode system, but not for a photocatalyst system. Since the particle size of A-BiVO4(s-m) on the FTO substrate was similar to that of A-BiVO4(s-t), the contact among particles of A-BiVO4(s-m) and an FTO substrate was not significantly different from that of A-BiVO4(s-t). Therefore, the superior property of the BiVO4(s-m) photoelectrode to BiVO4(s-t) was due to the intrinsic photocatalytic property. It was confirmed that the BiVO4(s-m) was a good visible-light-responsive material compared with BiVO4(s-t). Thus, the relationship between the crystal form and photoelectrochemical performance of BiVO4 was able to be systematically evaluated.
 Fig. 5  XRD patterns of BiVO4 on FTO calcined at (a) 373 K, (b) 573 K, and (c) 673 K, and anodic photocurrent by BiVO4 electrode (1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl) in 0.1 mol L−1 K2SO4. The BiVO4 was synthesized in 1 mol L−1 CH3COOH for 11 days. Light source: 300 W Xe lamp (λ ≥ 420 nm). 
In order to examine the effect of a preparation method of BiVO4 powder on the photoelectrochemical performance, N-BiVO4(s-m) and BiVO4(s-m) powders synthesized by urea method47 were also employed. These powders were also loaded to FTO plates and subsequently calcined at 673 K for 2 h. These electrodes were denoted as N-BiVO4(s-m) and U-BiVO4(s-m) electrodes, respectively. Fig. 6 shows I–V curves and SEM images of the BiVO4 electrodes. All BiVO4 electrodes gave anodic photocurrent under visible light irradiation. However, the anodic photocurrent of the A-BiVO4(s-m) electrode was two orders of magnitude larger than those of the N-BiVO4(s-m) and U-BiVO4(s-m) electrodes. This result would be opposite to the result expected from the high photocatalytic activity for O2 evolution of N-BiVO4(s-m) as shown in Table 1. SEM observation revealed that the A-BiVO4(s-m) particles were loaded on a FTO plate with uniform and good contact as shown in Fig. 6 (d). In contrast, N-BiVO4(s-m) and U-BiVO4(s-m) particles were built up on a FTO plate due to the large particle sizes, resulting in poor contacts among particles of BiVO4 and an FTO substrate. As mentioned above, the main reason why A-BiVO4(s-m) showed a low photocatalytic activity was the large number of charge recombination sites due to the low crystallinity. However, an externally applied potential can promote the charge separation in the photoelectrochemical system. The positive effects of the good contact due to a small particle size and the enhancement of the charge separation by the externally applied potential overwhelmed the negative effect of the large number of recombination center for the A-BiVO4(s-m) electrode. In contrast, the poor contact in the electrode structure for N-BiVO4(s-m) and U-BiVO4(s-m) resulted in the low efficiencies, being different from their intrinsic photocatalytic performances.

Fig. 7 shows the photocurrent of the A-BiVO4(s-m) electrode under visible light irradiation. The onset of the anodic photocurrent was around 0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl during sweeping to negative potential direction, whereas that rose up around −0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl during sweeping to positive potential direction. This different onset potential would be due to the change in the character of BiVO4 depending on the sweep direction of an applied potential. The cathodic photocurrent was observed from 0.3 V to −0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl during sweeping to negative potential, whereas it was not observed during sweeping to positive potential. It was considered that p-type-like semiconductor character appeared due to hole doping into BiVO4 by applying a positive potential to the BiVO4 electrode.

Fig. 8 shows an action spectrum of the A-BiVO4(s-m) electrode for incident photon-to-photocurrent efficiency (IPCE) at 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The IPCE was measured using monochromatic light controlled with band pass filters. The onset of the IPCE agreed well with that of the diffuse reflectance spectrum of BiVO4. This result indicated that the anodic photocurrent was attributable to the band gap transition of BiVO4.

A wet photovoltaic cell consisting of BiVO4 and Pt electrodes shown in Fig. 9(a) was employed in order to examine photoelectrochemical water splitting into H2 and O2 under visible light irradiation as shown in Fig. 9(b). Water splitting did not proceed without an external bias, whereas H2 and O2 evolved in the stoichiometric ratio at 0.8 V of an applied bias vs. the Pt counter electrode under visible light irradiation. Under this experimental condition, about 20 μA of anodic photocurrent was observed. The H2 evolution rate was calculated to be 0.37 μmol h−1 from the photocurrent. This calculated H2 evolution rate agreed well with the measured activity as shown in Fig. 9(b), indicating that anodic photocurrent was almost consumed for water splitting. Thus, the overall water splitting under visible light irradiation was achieved using the photoelectrode system employing the powdered photocatalyst which could not split water. Photoelectrochemical water splitting was also examined using a solar simulator (AM 1.5). H2 (0.14 μmol h−1) and O2 (0.11 μmol h−1) evolved at 0.8 V of an applied bias to the Pt counter electrode under simulated sunlight irradiation. The solar energy conversion efficiency was estimated to be 0.0014% from H2 evolution. Thus, the solar water splitting was achieved using the BiVO4 electrode.

Conclusions
Fine BiVO4 particles with tetragonal scheelite structure (s-t) were synthesized from Bi2O3 and V2O5 in an aqueous acetic acid solution. The BiVO4(s-t) particles transferred to fine BiVO4 particles with monoclinic scheelite structure (s-m) by calcination at 673 K. The BiVO4(s-m) showed higher photocatalytic activities for O2 evolution and MB decoloration than BiVO4(s-t). It was confirmed that the monoclinic scheelite structure was more suitable crystal form than tetragonal scheelite structure for photocatalytic reactions. BiVO4(s-m) electrodes were readily prepared by just pasting the obtained BiVO4(s-t) particles on an FTO plate and subsequently calcining at 673 K. The BiVO4(s-m) electrode gave an excellent anodic photocurrent under visible light irradiation. Although the BiVO4(s-m) electrode is basically an n-type semiconductor, it showed the possibility of a p-type semiconductor after applying a positive bias. Photoelectrochemical water splitting using a wet photovoltaic cell consisting of the BiVO4 photoelectrode and a Pt counter electrode proceeded under visible light and simulated sunlight irradiation with applying an external bias smaller than 1.23 V which was a theoretical voltage required for water splitting. The rates of evolved H2 and O2 corresponded to the observed photocurrent. Thus, the overall water splitting under visible light irradiation was achieved, and the photon energy conversion system using the BiVO4 electrode was successfully constructed.
