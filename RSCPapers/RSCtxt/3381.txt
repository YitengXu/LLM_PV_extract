1. Introduction
Photosensitization of semiconductors with dyes for solar energy conversion has already been studied since the 1960's.1 However, interest in this field started to grow considerably after O'Regan and Grätzel reported the development of a 7% efficient dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) consisting of a highly porous titanium dioxide electrode loaded with the ruthenium dye Ru(dcbpy)2(μ-(CN)Ru(CN)(bpy)2)2 in contact with an electrolyte containing the I−/I3− redox couple.2 During the past two decades, DSSCs have been investigated intensively and have gained acceptance as an alternative concept to traditional p–n junction photovoltaics, because they offer significantly reduced production costs and at the same time reasonable conversion efficiencies of up to 12.3%.3 Such state-of-the-art cells could still be improved by careful optimization of sensitizer regeneration kinetics.4
Apart from TiO2, other wide-bandgap semiconductors in combination with various photosensitizers have also been studied.5–7 Zinc oxide has particularly attracted interest as alternative semiconductor material for DSSCs because it offers good electrical properties (e.g. a high electron mobility).8,9 In many studies it was found that the electron collection efficiency in nanostructured ZnO is high enough to allow the construction of efficient DSSCs.10,11 Devices based on ZnO, however, do not reach the performance of TiO2 cells but are severely limited by poor injection and/or regeneration of the sensitizer.10 On the other hand, ZnO offers advantages in film preparation since it can be synthesized with high crystallinity under mild conditions, which allows its deposition on temperature-sensitive substrate materials like plastics or textiles.12–14 For example, electrochemical deposition in the presence of a structure-directing agent (SDA) represents a low-temperature (∼70 °C) and low-cost method for the preparation of porous yet highly crystalline ZnO electrodes that are well suited for application in dye-sensitized solar cells.12,15–17 The deposition bath usually consists of an oxygen-saturated aqueous electrolyte containing zinc chloride and the xanthene dye eosin Y as SDA.17 Interaction of the SDA with the growing zinc oxide layer results in the formation of sponge-like, nanoporous ZnO crystals with eosin Y occupying the pores.12 Following electrodeposition, the SDA can be removed from the hybrid film by soft alkaline treatment in pH 10.5 aqueous KOH.16,18 Subsequent adsorption of suitable sensitizers onto the large inner surface of the ZnO films yields active photoelectrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells.18 Many different dyes were investigated as sensitizers for ZnO, including ruthenium complexes,19,20 substituted metallophthalocyanines21–23 and various fully organic dyes.24–26 The highest conversion efficiency reached so far for DSSC based on electrodeposited ZnO is 5.56% and was accomplished using the fully organic indoline dye D149.12,24
Both the dye content as well as the film thickness can significantly influence the photovoltaic performance of dye-sensitized solar cells.19,27 For instance, increasing the film thickness and thus the internal surface area while keeping the total dye content constant was found to decrease the open circuit photovoltage because of the presence of additional electron recombination pathways.27 However, thicker films can be loaded with more dye and hence absorb a larger fraction of incident light.28 In thinner films, an increased dye loading will increase the aggregation probability, which promotes radiationless decay and thereby decreases the probability of electron injection.29,30
SECM has been found to be a powerful technique for probing a wide range of interfacial kinetics.31,32 SECM feedback mode approach curves based on approaching an ultramicroelectrode (UME) to a substrate and following its current response as a function of the distance from the surface offer attractive advantages as a means of studying dye regeneration kinetics in dye sensitized photoelectrochemical cells.33–38 The principle of the SECM measurement of photoelectrochemical redox kinetics in DSSC in a highly localized area has been introduced in our previous report33 and is shown schematically in Fig. 1. Briefly, the dye-sensitized ZnO electrode is operated as a substrate (sample) in the SECM setup with back illumination. A Pt wire connects the fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) back contact to the I3− electrolyte. The surface area of the wire is large compared to the illuminated area at the sample and several millimetres separated from the DSSC. If the substrate is under illumination, iodide ions electrogenerated at the UME with radius rT in a distance d (d < 5rT) to the sample rapidly diffuse to the substrate and reduce the photo-oxidized dye molecules adsorbed onto the surface and form I3− which diffuses back to the UME, where it is reduced. Therefore, the photoelectrochemical redox reaction on the sample surface induces a change of the UME current as the UME approaches the interface. Our previous study33,34 could relate the current change with I3− mediator bulk concentration [I3−]* and the wavelength λ and/or intensity of illumination Jhυ using a simplified kinetic model for dye regeneration.

In this study, ZnO–D149 films of different film thickness lfilm and dye loading ΓD were prepared by varying the ZnO deposition time as well as the residence time in the D149 adsorption solution. The dye loading of the films was measured using UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy. Basic photovoltaic parameters of the films (open-circuit photovoltage VOC and short-circuit photocurrent Jsc) were determined from current–voltage characterization. Time-resolved photovoltage measurements were used to derive the effective electron lifetime τn.39,40 The kinetics of D149 regeneration by iodide ions in the electrolyte was studied using a SECM feedback mode approach on the films under two different experimental conditions (varying I3− mediator bulk concentration and illumination intensity). The result was interpreted using a revised SECM kinetic model for dye regeneration. The perspective of correlating the SECM kinetic parameter to the macroscopic solar cell characteristics is discussed.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of D149-sensitized ZnO thin films
Porous zinc oxide–eosin Y hybrid films on FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) coated glass substrates (Asahi glass, sheet resistance <12 Ω square−1, effective transmittance >85%) were electrodeposited at 70 °C in a thermostat-controlled cell using a three-electrode arrangement with FTO glass as a working electrode, a zinc rod (Riedel-de-Haën) counter electrode and a RedRod (Radiometer) reference electrode (0.04 V vs. SCE). For the deposition, 110 mL of an aqueous, 0.1 M solution of KCl (Merck, ≥99.5%) were filled into the deposition cell and saturated with O2 (Air Liquide, technical grade) gas. The FTO-coated glass substrate was pre-treated by immersing it into 45% HNO3 (Roth) for 2 minutes. After that, the substrate was mounted on a rotating electrode holder, contacted by an electrically conductive tape (Chomerics CCK-36-101) and fixed by an insulating tape (neo-Lab) leaving uncovered a circular active electrode area of 2 cm in diameter. The substrate was immersed into the O2-saturated KCl solution and a rotating speed of 500 rpm (Radiometer CTV101) was set. Using a Wenking potentiostat LPG03 (Bank Elektronik), a constant potential of −1.1 V vs. SCE was applied. The substrate was then activated by electrolysis in the oxygen-saturated KCl solution for 5 minutes. After this, an aqueous ZnCl2 (Merck, ≥98%) solution was added to the electrolyte so that the concentration of zinc chloride in the electrolyte was adjusted to 5 mM. This triggered the growth of a compact zinc oxide film (blocking layer). After another 5 minutes, an aqueous eosin Y (Kanto, 85%) solution was added to adjust the concentration to 50 μM eosin Y and to initiate the deposition of a ZnO–eosin Y hybrid film, which was carried out for 10, 20 or 30 minutes. Following electrodeposition, the films were rinsed with water and dried in a nitrogen flow.
To remove eosin Y out of the pores, the samples were immersed in aqueous solution (adjusted to pH 10.5) of KOH (Roth, ≥85%) and were irradiated with the light of two fluorescent tubes, which accelerates the eosin Y desorption process. The indoline dye D149 (5-[[4-[4-(2,2-diphenylethenyl)phenyl]-1,2,3,3a,4,8b-hexahydrocyclopent[b]indol-7-yl]methylene]-2-(3-ethyl-4-oxo-2-thioxo-5-thiazolidinylidene)-4-oxo-3-thiazolidineacetic acid synthesized as reported earlier24) was adsorbed from a solution containing 0.5 mM D149 and 1 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (Fluka BioChemika, 98.0%) in a mixture of acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%, anhydrous) and tert-butanol (Roth, ≥99.5%) (1:1 by volume). The adsorption was carried out in the dark at room temperature. Adsorption times of 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min or 120 min were used. Samples were divided and pieces of identical samples were characterized by different techniques.
The total ZnO–D149 film thickness was determined from confocal laser microscopy images of small pieces cut out of the ZnO–D149 films recorded with a Keyence VK-9700K. At the cutting edges, the ZnO–D149 films were partly scratched off the FTO-coated glass substrate to measure the step height between FTO and the ZnO–D149 films. The thickness was determined at three different sites of each piece of film and the obtained values were averaged. This method was confirmed by profilometry (Tencor Instruments α-step 10-00020) performed at the border of the films (defined during deposition by the insulating tape).
Atomic absorption spectrometry was used to determine the zinc content of small pieces of the ZnO–D149 samples of known area. For this purpose, the films were dissolved in 40 mL of 0.2% HNO3 solution. Atomic absorption of the solutions at a wavelength of 213.9 nm (characteristic for zinc atoms) was measured by a PerkinElmer Analyst 300. A linear calibration curve using three standard solutions containing 0.2 mg L−1, 0.6 mg L−1 and 1.2 mg L−1 zinc was obtained. The AAS measurements yielded the zinc concentration of the sample solutions, from which the amount of zinc oxide in the film was calculated. Porosities p (void volume over total volume of the porous part of the ZnO film) were calculated from the amount of ZnO in the porous part of the film and the volume of the porous part of the film determined by the thickness lporous of the porous layer. The blocking layer thickness and the amount of ZnO in the blocking layer were estimated from the amount of charge transferred during the blocking layer electrodeposition using Faraday's law and assuming a current efficiency of 90% for the electrodeposition of compact ZnO.41
UV–Vis absorption spectra of the D149-sensitized ZnO films were measured in transmission using a tec5 UV–Vis spectrometer system (consisting of an LS-CH device for illumination and an LOE-USB device for detection) or a Lambda900 spectrometer (PerkinElmer). For the determination of the D149 loading ΓD [mol cm−2], i.e. the amount of dye per geometric sample area of the ZnO–D149 films, a small piece was cut from each of the samples and was immersed into 3 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) to dissolve D149 out of the films. When the dye had been completely dissolved, UV–Vis absorption spectra of the obtained solutions were recorded using a Lambda900 spectrometer (PerkinElmer). This allowed determining the amount of D149 via the Lambert–Beer law using an extinction coefficient of 68000 L mol−1 cm−1 of D149 in DMF solution at 531 nm.42 The D149 loading was then calculated by dividing this amount by the area of the piece of film determined by pixel count analysis of photographic images of the pieces using image analysis software. The ratio ΓD/(plporous), the dye concentration referred to the total pore volume in the film, is used as a rough measure for the amount of dye per internal surface area of the films. This is valid if the pore geometry and size are assumed to be constant for all films.
2.2 Photoelectrochemical measurements
In order to allow direct comparison with the SECM measurements (Section 2.3) the photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode arrangement instead of a sandwich-type two-electrode cell as it would be more appropriate to provide optimum comparability to other work on DSSCs. The dye-sensitized ZnO film was mounted as a working electrode, a Pt wire as a counter electrode and a Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode with acetonitrile as internal solvent. The electrolyte was composed of a mixture of acetonitrile and ethylene carbonate (1:4 by volume) dissolving 0.5 M tetra-N-butylammonium iodide (TBAI) and 0.05 M iodine. An IviumStat potentiostat/galvanostat was employed for all measurements. For the measurement of the time-resolved photovoltage at open circuit as well as the current–voltage curves, the illumination was performed by a 1000 W Xenon arc lamp (LOT Oriel) equipped with a water filter. Neutral density filters were used to adjust the light intensity measured by a thermopile (Laserpoint) to 100 mW cm−2 and the illumination time was controlled using a mechanical shutter (Prontor magnetic E/40m, response time of 12 ms).
2.3 SECM apparatus and procedure
The basic SECM apparatus used for photoelectrochemical experiments was described previously.34 A three-electrode cell made of Teflon base with small opening from back side was placed on a home-made 2-axis tilt platform, which allowed parallel adjustment of the sensitized ZnO electrode with respect to the lateral movement of the SECM tip. A custom made potentiostat μP3 (M. Schramm, University of Düsseldorf, Germany) was used to control the potential of the UME, while the current was acquired using AD/DA (PCI DAS 1602/16, plug in Elektronik, Eichenau, Germany) data acquisition card through home developed SECMx software. A solution of 0.057 mM–2.01 mM KI3 in acetonitrile–tetra-N-butylammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate (TBAS) was used as a redox mediator. The solution was prepared by mixing equimolar amounts of KI and I2 in acetonitrile–TBAS and diluting the resulting stock solution to the required concentration. KI, iodine (Fluka) and acetonitrile (Spectrochem, HPLC grade) were purified before use as described previously.34
The dye-sensitized ZnO film was illuminated through glass/FTO by a green LED with maximum emission intensity at 529 nm wavelength. The LED intensity was controlled using an XPOT potentiostat (Zahner electric, Kronach, Germany). The LED was placed close to the cell and focused on the dye-sensitized film by an objective lens (10×, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) so that the photo-illuminated spot had a diameter of about 0.7 mm (1.54 × 10−2 mm2). The integrated light intensity at the position of the sample was measured using a laser power meter (FieldMaster, Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, USA).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Film characterization

Fig. 2 shows absorption spectra of D149 adsorbed on the porous ZnO films of varied thickness and dye loading. The spectra clearly reveal broad absorption bands peaking at approximately 532 nm, superimposed to a background signal due to scattering of light by the zinc oxide film. This proves the successful impregnation of the films with the dye and thus accessibility of the pores for all films. The absorption maximum for 120 min adsorption time is out of scale, i.e. the transmitted light intensity was below the detection limit of the instrument. This is probably due to high dye loading in the film and/or pronounced light scattering. Table 1a summarizes the thickness lporous of the porous part of the ZnO films, their porosities p, the dye loading ΓD and the ratio ΓD/(plporous), as determined by solution UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy after dissolving the dye out of the films. For effective description, we assign a sample code , with X being a sample number, ΓD given in 10−8 mol cm−2 and lporous given in μm (Table 1a). The trend of the ΓD as a function of residence time in the dye bath and film thickness is in line with the trend of peak heights in the solid-state absorption spectra (Fig. 2). However, the sample 2.3S22.6 shows a smaller ΓD than 3.3S33.0, although its absorbance measured by solid-state UV–Vis spectroscopy appeared to be higher (out of scale). This means that the off-scale absorbance was probably caused by strong light scattering rather than by a large ΓD.

3.2 Photoelectrochemical properties of D149-sensitized ZnO photoelectrodes

Current–voltage characteristics. 

Fig. 3 and Table 1a show current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the nanoporous D149–ZnO films 1.3S11.2 to 0.4S62.9 in contact with an I−/I3− redox electrolyte at an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Changes are observed both in open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) for the films of different lporous and ΓD. A correlation was computed among all the quantities investigated here (Table 1b). The Jsc increases with increasing ΓD, characteristic for an increased absorption of light. Jsc also increases with ΓD/(plporous), even more significantly. It is thereby indicated that the efficiency of electron injection is not limited by deactivation of excited states by dye aggregates which becomes more likely at increased proximity of dye molecules on the inner ZnO surface. Close proximity of indoline dye molecules on oxide semiconductor surfaces can on the other hand lead to direct hole hopping among the molecules.43 Such additional charge transport could lead to an increased photocurrent by facilitated dye regeneration as explicitly investigated below.
 Fig. 3  Current–voltage characteristics of ZnO–D149 films of different thickness and different D149 loading with white light illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (close to AM 1.5 conditions). The film thickness and dye loading were given in Table 1a. The electrolyte consisted of 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M TBAI dissolved in acetonitrile:ethylenecarbonate (1:4) was used. 
As can be seen from Table 1a, the open-circuit photovoltages observed for the samples analyzed in this study range from −404 mV to −515 mV. No clear correlation between Voc and any of the structural characteristics is found (Table 1b). In the present experiments Voc seems to be mainly determined by recombination processes between the semiconductor and the electrolyte and is widely independent of either blocking of recombination by adsorbed dye molecules or dye-mediated recombination. It is reasonable to assume that the observed variation of Voc stems from changes in the density and energetic distribution of trap states in ZnO which are not explicitly analyzed in the present study.


Time-resolved photovoltage measurement. 
Time-resolved measurements of the decay of the open-circuit voltage following an illumination pulse are used to characterize the recombination dynamics in D149–ZnO solar cells. The decay curve provides access to the electron lifetime τn in the dye-sensitized porous semiconductor as a function of the open-circuit voltage (i.e. the position of the electron quasi-Fermi level) via the relationship (1)where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, e is the elementary charge and t is the time.44
The lifetime curves obtained for the samples of different film thickness and dye loading are shown in Fig. 4. In the high voltage range the curves reflect the recombination rate that is significant for device performance under realistic conditions. In this range, typically a linear relationship between log τn and Voc is expected, reflecting recombination determined by detrapping of electrons from an exponential distribution of localized states in the porous semiconductor.45 However, in the present study the curves are all slightly non-linear, indicating a non-exponential trap distribution. To analyze possible correlations of the lifetime under operating conditions with the structural characteristics of the films, the values of τn at the highest photovoltage reached by all samples (−0.4 V) were inserted into the correlation matrix (Table 1b). No clear correlation could be found with either of the structural parameters (lporous, p, ΓD, ΓD/lporous or ΓD/(plporous)). This means that the amount of dye molecules and their distribution on the porous ZnO surface are not decisive for the overall rate of recombination in the present set of samples. Most likely the differences in the lifetimes between the six samples are caused by differences in the density of traps that influence recombination between ZnO and the electrolyte.45
 Fig. 4  Effective electron lifetime of ZnO–D149 films of different thickness and different D149 loading as determined by open-circuit voltage decay measurements. The film thickness and dye loading were given in Table 1a. 
For lower voltages, the shape of the curves in Fig. 4 differs significantly for the six samples. This could again be caused by different densities and distributions of localized states in the porous ZnO, in this case those with energy levels far below the conduction band level. On the other hand, it is known that recombination via the FTO-coated substrate can lead to a strong decrease of the electron lifetime in the lower voltage range.46 In this sense, the results could indicate that insulation by the blocking layer is insufficient for some of the samples, e.g.1.3S11.2 and 2.3S22.6, while it is better for others, e.g.1.8S44.6 and 0.4S62.9.

3.3 SECM measurement of the dye regeneration rate
There is a serious lack of systematic studies on the effect of dye loading and film thickness on the rate of dye regeneration. A lot of studies about film thickness and dye loading refer to macroscopic characteristics of solar cells (e.g. Voc and Jsc) and not to reaction rate e.g. rate of dye regeneration. These quantities depend on the rate of regeneration but also on rates of other phenomena. SECM feedback measurement allowed analysis of dye regeneration kinetics at a microscopic sample.33,34,38 The extent of feedback at the dye-sensitized substrate could effectively be controlled by regulating tri-iodide bulk concentration [I3−]*, photon flux Jhv, dye loading ΓD and film thickness lfilm.
SECM feedback mode approach curves on D149–ZnO film electrodes in the electrolyte solution containing I3− redox species were measured with an ultramicroelectrode (UME) biased at a tip potential of −0.7 V against the Pt quasi-reference electrode with an approach speed of 2 μm s−1. At this potential the reduction of I3− to I− at the UME is diffusion-controlled. At first, the distance of the closest approach to the surface was estimated by recording approach curves above the non-illuminated D149–ZnO film substrate and comparing it to the theoretical approach curve to an electrically insulating surface using the analytical approximation of Amphlett and Denuault47 (ESI†). Then, the UME was withdrawn and a series of approach curves was measured on illuminated D149–ZnO films with different I3− mediator bulk concentrations [I3−]* and illumination intensities expressed in photon flux Jhν. The iodide I− produced at the UME tip reacts at the illuminated dye-sensitized film producing a flux of I3− back to the tip. This influences the tip current compared to that observed when the tip is far from the surface. The approach curves are displayed in normalized form, in which the UME current iT and distance d from the substrate were divided by the steady state current far from the substrate iT,∞ and UME tip radius rT, respectively.

Approach curves with varying [I3−]*. 

Fig. 5 and Fig. S1 (ESI†) show the normalized SECM approach curves recorded with Pt UME (rT = 12.5 μm) approaching to D149–ZnO films of varied film thickness and dye loading. The working solution contained different [I3−]* in 0.1 M TBAS–acetonitrile solution. The top and bottom dashed lines represent theoretical curves for diffusion-controlled reaction at the substrate (positive feedback) and hindered diffusion (no reaction at the sample, “negative feedback”), respectively. Open symbols are experimental data and solid lines are theoretical fits to the analytical approximation by Cornut and Lefrou for first order finite heterogeneous kinetics at the substrate48 (ESI†). The fitting of the normalized approach curves yields a dimensionless normalized rate constant κ. With the knowledge of rT and the diffusion coefficient of I3− in the electrolyte, an effective heterogeneous first order rate constant keff [cm s−1] is obtained. (2)
 Fig. 5  Normalized SECM approach curves obtained with Pt UME (rT = 12.5 μm) on D149–ZnO films of sample 1.3S11.2 containing different [I3−]*: (2) 0.057 mM, (3) 0.124 mM, (4) 0.248 mM, (5) 0.687 mM, (6) 1.24 mM and (7) 2.01 mM with ET = −0.7 V and Jhν = 9.1 × 10−9 mol cm−2 s−1. The summary of κ obtained from the best fits of experimental data (open symbols) to the theoretical model (solid lines) was: (2) 2.1, (3) 0.94, (4) 0.5, (5) 0.28, (6) 0.22, (7) 0.21. Curves (1) and (8) represent responses limited by diffusion-controlled feedback and hindered diffusion, respectively. 
Table S1a (ESI†) summarizes the keff derived from the κ values as a function of [I3−]*. A common feature for all curves in Fig. 5 and Fig. S1 (ESI†) is that they all lie in the finite kinetics regime, indicating that heterogeneous reaction at the substrate is slower than the mediator diffusion. It must be emphasized that the low [I3−]* and the comparatively large radius of the UME (rT = 12.5 μm) were intentionally selected to drive the reaction into a kinetically controlled regime that allows analysis of the substrate kinetics. The normalized approach curves depend very strongly on the thickness of the film and concentration of adsorbed dye. It is found that for the given Jhv and [I3−]*, keff decreased with increasing film thickness and dye loading. For example, D149 regeneration at Jhν = 9.1 × 10−9 mol cm−2 s−1 and [I3−]* = 0.124 mM yields keff of 1.03 × 10−2 cm s−1 with sample 1.3S11.2, while sample 2.3S22.6 under the same conditions produces only 8.22 × 10−3 cm s−1, see Table S1a (ESI†). For a given sample (characterized by ΓD, lporous, and p) one expects a decrease of keff with increasing [I3−]*. An increase of [I3−]* increases [I−] after diffusion controlled reduction at the UME. At sample surfaces with a limited number of reaction sites, increasing the available [I−] does not lead to proportionally increased reaction currents at the sample. On the other hand iT,∞ increases proportionally to [I3−]*. The normalized current IT = iT/iT,∞ thus decreases with increasing mediator concentration at such samples. Similar effects are common for the investigation of immobilized redox enzymes.49,50


Approach curves under varied light intensity. 
The influence of illumination intensity on the kinetics of dye regeneration was studied in the presence of a fixed [I3−]*. Fig. 6 shows normalized approach curves acquired above sample 1.3S11.2 in a solution with [I3−]* = 0.124 mM and illuminated at different Jhν. For low intensities κ values for I3− regeneration at the surface are very close to the value obtained at the non-illuminated D149–ZnO film, whereas its value increases strongly as the Jhν is increased. Increasing Jhν increased κ and hence keff, which levels off at higher Jhν. A similar behavior was observed for other D149–ZnO electrodes (see ESI†, S2b). However, in these cases lower κ were found (except for 2.3S22.6). The summary of Jhν and keff values is given in Table S1b (ESI†).

The summary of κ obtained from the best fits of experimental data (open symbols) to the theoretical model (solid lines) was: (2) 0.14 (3) 0.25, (4) 0.44, (5) 0.74, (6) 0.83, (7) 0.91. Curve (1) represents response controlled by hindered diffusion. 


Analysis of keff for dye regeneration rate. 
In order to relate the calculated curve to the more complicated case of dye regeneration, we followed an example of Liu et al.32 for relating the kinetics at ferrocene-terminated self-assembled monolayers to SECM feedback curves. A derived expression of IS for the more complicated mechanisms is compared to the one for an uncomplicated electron transfer with the normalized first order rate constant κ = keffrT/D. Such an analysis has been carried out by assuming that the dye is uniformly accessible to light and mediator.33
Previously, our group reported a SECM kinetic model for dye regeneration in SECM feedback experiments at the illuminated dye-sensitized electrode by assuming the reaction rate law of order 1.5 with respect to [I−].33 In a recent paper we treated the kinetics of a TiO2–N719 DSSC with a model of reaction order one because a transient spectroscopic method had proven several intermediates of the mechanisms and provided indications for this reaction order.51–54 In this paper, we treat the dye regeneration kinetics at ZnO–D149 by an effective rate law of order one. The mechanisms provided below add arguments for this reaction order although less spectroscopic work has been reported compared to the TiO2 system and Ru dyes. A comparison to a model of order 1.5 is provided in the S4 (ESI†) and discussed below.
The regeneration of the dye and formation of I3− at the sample as for the SECM configuration in Fig. 1 occurs by coupled reactions at the dye-sensitized electrode–electrolyte interface. Here we consider a molecular mechanism of dye regeneration at D149–ZnO analogous to N719–TiO2 solar cells. Therefore, at the illuminated D149-sensitized ZnO electrode–electrolyte–UME probe: (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) I3− + 2e− → 3I− (at the Pt microelectrode)(8)
The reciprocal of the total substrate current under steady-state 1/IS could be expressed in terms of individual current contributions (eqn (3)–(7)) in their respective normalized form55,56 as (9)where IT,cond corresponds to the normalized UME current due to I3− diffusion between the UME and the substrate surface (eqn (8)), IK,lim is the normalized limiting finite kinetic substrate current and Iel,film is the normalized limiting electron conduction current in the ZnO film. IK,lim arises due to light absorption by the dye D (eqn (3)), electron injection into the ZnO conduction band (eqn (4)), heterogeneous electron transfer between I− and D+ or [D⋯I] complex formation (eqn (5)), I2−˙ formation (eqn (6)) and I2−˙ disproportionation (eqn (7)). By assuming negligible recombination kinetics, the kinetically controlled substrate current iK could be expressed as: iK = nFA(k1ΓD[I−]s)(10)
The limiting iK,lim is achieved if [I−]S = 3[I3−]*. Further simplifications are obtained by introduction of effective constants for light absorption and dye regeneration (khν,eff)−1 = (ϕhνJhν)−1 + (kinj)−1 ≈ (ϕhνJhν)−1 and ()−1 = (k1)−1 + (k2)−1. Considering mass balance for different forms of dye D followed by appropriate substitution results in eqn (11). (11)where ϕhν is absorption cross-section of dye molecules and A = πr2T is the active area of the UME and approximately the area of the D149–ZnO film that participates in dye regeneration. The experimentally determined dye loading is related to a volume concentration [Do] of the dye in the nanoporous ZnO by ΓD° = [D°]lporous. Details of the derivation are given in S3 (ESI†).
Under the conditions of low [I−] and low light intensities used in this experiment, we assume that iel,lim is not limiting the overall tip current. The following detailed estimation shows that this assumption holds within the thickness investigated here. The electron transport through the porous ZnO material is controlled by diffusion according to Fick's law.57 We assume that the diffusion coefficient of electrons in ZnO is approximately equal to that of the charge-balancing ions Dion in the electrolyte. Furthermore Dion is similar to the diffusion coefficient D in the bulk solution. This agrees with electron diffusion coefficients determined earlier for similar ZnO materials.11,58 The maximum electron concentration Nel,max occurs at the film electrolyte interface, i.e. at distance l. Under conditions of steady-state, the concentration gradient of Nel,max must be approximately linear if no loss processes are important. Thus, iel,lim could be approximated as: (12)
The ratio of the maximum electron concentration Nel,max in ZnO and [I3−]* is determined by the sequences of reactions at the film surface (eqn (3)–(7)) and back reaction of electrons from the ZnO conduction band 2e− + I3− → 3I−. A typical value is Nel,max = 1.7 × 10−4 mol cm−3.59 Using eqn (12) quantitative data for Iel,lim can be obtained from known values of the following parameters: Dion = D = 1.37 × 10−5 cm s−1, rT = 12.5 × 10−4 cm, lfilm = 1.4 × 10−4 cm (sample 1.3S11.2) and [I3−]* = 1.24 × 10−7 mol cm−3. The value of Iel,lim = 4804.5 (normalized quantity) was obtained. This is greater than any of the normalized currents we might encounter in any of the SECM experiments which are carried out under conditions of very low [I−] compared to the operational DSSC. Even if l and [I3−]* would be increased, Iel,lim would still be much larger than the kinetic current and thus not limiting for the overall current. Therefore, substituting eqn (11) in eqn (9) and assuming that iel,lim≫iT,cond or iK,lim on the level of this very simplified kinetic analysis and comparison of the resulting expression to the uncomplicated first order process at the sample55 leads to keff as a function of [I3−]* or Jhν (eqn (13)), details in S3, ESI.† (13)
Fitting experimental keff to the theoretical approximation model eqn (13) allows determining  and ϕhν as the fitting parameters.

Fig. 7a shows the fit of keffvs. [I3−]* and Fig. 7b shows the fit of keffvs. Jhν for six samples with systematically varied lporous and ΓD. For each sample in both plots, the best fit of experimental and theoretical response of keff([I3−]*, Jhν) yielded the same  (Table 1a). Furthermore, all samples have been fitted with identical ϕhν = 2.91 × 107 cm2 mol−1. The keff values decrease with increasing [I3−]* and increase with increasing Jhν as expected by the model. Steady-state plateaus are reached at high values of [I3−]* or Jhν for all samples investigated. We have also analyzed these data using the kinetic equation of the dye regeneration reaction order 1.5 with respect to [I−]33 (see Fig. S4, ESI†). For this kinetic model consistent values of kox and ϕhν were found as well (Table S2, ESI†), suggesting that either model could empirically describe the feedback approach curve data for dye regeneration. However, in contrast to eqn (13), the kinetic model for the reaction order of 1.5 predicts a decrease of keff for very low mediator concentrations (Fig. S3, ESI†). This decrease has never been observed experimentally for mediator concentration as low as 0.06 mM. But this alone may not be a sufficient reason to reject another reaction order because experimental uncertainties in this concentration range might be substantial. A reaction order of 1.5 could occur in a porous solid in contact with a fluid phase. A typical example is in heterogeneous catalysis if transport in the internal solid is important60 where an apparent reaction order napp = 0.5(nreal + 1) is found. If the real reaction order nreal is one, also the apparent order would be one. If nreal = 2, napp would be 1.5.
 Fig. 7  Plot of (a) keffvs. [I3−]* and (b) keffvs. Jhν for six different D149-sensitized ZnO photoelectrodes with systematically varied thickness and dye loading. The corresponding data for [I3−]*, Jhν and keff were given in Table S1a and S1b (ESI†). Symbols correspond to experimental keff data and lines are theoretical fittings of the model described in eqn (13). The best fit of experimental and theoretical keff([I3−]*, Jhν) yields ϕhν value of 2.91 × 107 cm2 mol−1 and  values given in Table 1a. 
Furthermore, from eqn (13), it can be seen that 1/keff should be proportional to the ratio [I3−]*/Jhν and the intercept of the plot of 1/keffvs. [I3−]*/Jhν provides a constant from which  can be obtained. It is found that for small ratios of [I3−]*/Jhv the data are indeed on a line with reasonable scatter. The  of 6.3 × 105 mol−1 cm3 s−1 can be obtained for sample 1.3S11.2 from the linear fit of the points positioned on the line (Fig. 8) and it is in reasonable agreement with the values that we found from fitting all data values. For larger ratios of [I3−]*/Jhν the results for the variation of [I3−]* and Jhν clearly depart from each other. Variation of light intensity seems to follow the linear trend found for small ratios [I3−]*/Jhν, but variation of concentration seems to fall below the expectation of the linear model. It means that we observe a higher rate constant than what we would expect from the initial trend at low [I3−]*. Similar trends are observed for other samples (S5, ESI†).

As confirmed by various fitting procedures, a considerable difference is observed in  values among the six D149–ZnO electrodes of varied lporous and ΓD. It is found that  values are negatively correlated to the thickness of the ZnO layers but positively correlated to the dye loading ΓD (Table 1b). Our very simplified model assumes uniform accessibility of the dye molecules with respect to illumination and I− diffusion. The obtained  values are therefore effective parameters. This would be the real value if all dye molecules would have uniform accessibility for light and mediator. The effective quantities provide consistent descriptions if one electrode is analyzed under different mediator conditions (within the validity range of the model, i.e. at low mediator concentrations (≤1 mM) and low Jhν). However, when comparing different samples, the internal mass transport processes of I− inside the films become more important with increasing lporous and the effective  values tend to decrease with increasing electrode thickness as a consequence of the limitations by internal mass transport processes. We have seen an analogous behavior for the SECM investigations of immobilized enzymes in multilayer arrangements of intentionally reduced complexity.61,62 The situation in the DSSC is considerably more complex and it is remarkable that a similar conclusion could be drawn here. The other important parameter ϕhν came out as constant for all electrodes in our set. This is reasonable because it depends on the extinction coefficient of the dye which can be considered constant even at high packing densities of D149 since only very little spectral broadening was observed for D149 adsorbed on ZnO.
It was found that  shows direct correlation with ΓD/(plporous) which also correlated directly with Jsc. The quantity ΓD/(plporous) is taken as a measure for the amount of dye molecules per internal surface area. This is justified if the pore geometry and pore size are assumed to be constant for all films. Correlation to this quantity would indicate effects caused by the lateral distance between dye molecules on the surface. This shows that the distance between the dye molecules is of importance for the dye regeneration. With increasing concentration of D149 molecules,  increases, i.e. the regeneration of oxidized dye molecules is facilitated by hole conduction within adsorbed layers of D149, as also concluded from independent cyclic voltammetry at D149 adsorbed to TiO2.43 The short-circuit photocurrent shows the same increase with ΓD/(plporous) indicating the dependence on dye regeneration rate. It is concluded that regeneration of the dye molecules rather than charge transport through the semiconductor matrix is limiting the photocurrent in the present system. Since no influence of the dye concentration on the open circuit photovoltage or the electron lifetime is seen, neither a blocking nor a facilitation of recombination by the dye molecules is detected in the present experiments.

4. Conclusions
The photovoltaic performance, electron recombination, and dye regeneration kinetics by the I−/I3− redox couple, all relevant in dye-sensitized solar cells, were studied depending on film thickness and dye loading of D149-sensitized ZnO photoelectrodes. It was found that the photocurrent increased with the total dye content ΓD and, even more clearly, with the dye concentration on the inner surface ΓD/(plporous). Close proximity of the sensitizer molecules seems to assist the photoelectrochemical efficiency rather than decreasing it by radiationless decay in dye aggregates. The photovoltage and the electron lifetime, however, showed no clear correlation to neither ΓD nor ΓD/(plporous) suggesting that they are mainly determined by the electronic structure of the semiconductor. From SECM feedback approach curve analysis, considerably different effective heterogeneous first order rate constants  for the D149 regeneration are observed among the photoelectrodes of systematically varied thickness and dye loading. It is found that  does not depend on ΓD but correlates very strongly with ΓD/(plporous). This suggests that dye regeneration is heavily supported by close proximity of the sensitizer molecules. By systematic variation of film thickness and dye loading, non-uniform accessibility of dye molecules for I− as well as unequal light intensity reaching dye molecules in different vertical distances from the back contact become more pronounced. Further refinement of the SECM model avoiding the assumption of a constant accessibility of the dye molecules by the redox electrolyte is necessary in order to incorporate structural variations within the pore system and to more directly address functional characteristics of dye-sensitized ZnO films from different characterization methods into predictive models. The aggregation effects of the dye could be important and the dye loading may influence the tendency for recombination. The strong scattering in the films makes a description of the local light intensity difficult. In addition it turned out to be challenging to prepare films in which only one parameter is changed while all other structural parameters are kept constant. Furthermore, gradients in dye concentration across the film thickness cannot be excluded because even after long adsorption times, the dye loading still seems to increase for a given material thickness. Furthermore, surface effects (ion absorption, Donnan exclusion) not considered in the model may influence the response. Adsorption or association of negatively charged ions within the pores in ZnO or at the dye molecules may hinder the access of negatively charged I− into the pores. The extent of this effect will depend on the mediator concentration but also on the pore diameter that seems to vary between the preparations.
