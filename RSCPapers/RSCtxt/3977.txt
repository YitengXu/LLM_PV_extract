    , Accepted 22nd February 2023First published on 23rd February 2023AbstractCobalt phosphides (CoP) are considered as ideal bifunctional electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline condition. However, their performance and stability are significantly limited by their low conductivity and severe surface reconstitution. To counter this, herein, a copper foam supported N-doped carbon nanowire array confined CoP nanoparticle hybrid (CoP@NCNWAs/CF) as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting (OWS) is prepared by an impregnation–cation exchange–phosphating strategy. Theoretical and experimental results verify that NCNWAs can not only boost electron transfer and regulate the electronic structure of CoP, but also suppress excessive surface reconstruction to form CoOOH during the OER process, thus enhancing the electroactivity and stability of the HER and OER. As a result, the as-prepared CoP@NCNWAs/CF exhibits outstanding catalytic electroactivity towards the HER and OER, including low overpotentials of 166 and 287 mV at a current density (j) of 100 mA cm−2, respectively. Moreover, a CoP@NCNWAs/CF-based electrolyzer delivers a j of 400 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of only 1.83 V, even surpassing commercial Pt + RuO2 catalysts. This work provides guidance for further design of high-performance CoP-based electrocatalysts.
Introduction
To meet the increasing demand for energy, it is crucial to explore clean and sustainable alternative fuels. Hydrogen (H2) with the highest gravimetric energy density, zero-carbon emission, and recyclability is the most appealing and competitive next-generation energy carrier.1 Electrochemical water splitting (EWS) under alkaline condition powered by clean and renewable energy sources (wind energy, solar, etc.) is regarded as one of the most efficient strategies to produce H2.2 However, the sluggish reaction kinetics of the HER and OER in alkaline electrolytes make it challenging to obtain H2 with high production efficiency. To reduce the reaction energy barrier and boost the kinetics, high activity electrocatalysts are often required in practical applications.3–5 Nowadays, Pt and RuO2/IrO2 are the state-of-art HER and OER electrocatalysts, respectively. But their rare reserves, poor durability, and high cost make them unsuitable for large-scale industrial utilization. Moreover, a single Pt/C or RuO2/IrO2 cannot efficiently facilitate the EWS process due to the limitation of activity.6 Hence, many studies have been conducted on designing noble-metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysts such as sulfides, phosphides, nitrides, and carbides.7–10 Among them, CoP-based catalysts owing to their low cost and high catalytic activity are considered as advanced substitutes.11–13 Unfortunately, their low conductivity and excessive surface reconstruction greatly reduce the activity and stability of CoP-based electrocatalysts in practical applications.14
In recent years, lots of research studies have shown that a unique capsule structure constructed using CoP coated with carbon layers (CoP@C) is one of the most ideal strategies to overcome the above issues.15,16 The CoP/carbon interfaces can effectively manipulate surface electronic features and enhance charge transfer at the interfacial regions to reduce the adsorption and activation energy for intermediates.17 Moreover, the confinement effect of carbon layers can inhibit excessive corrosion of the catalyst surface and enhance the charge transfer. However, most reported CoP@C-based materials were synthesized in the form of powder and often required a polymer binder (e.g. Nafion) in practical use, which inevitably hampers the charge transfer, blocks the active sites, and inhibits the penetration of the electrolyte and the diffusion of gases. Furthermore, the coated powder electrocatalysts are easily peeled off from the electrode due to the fast release of H2/O2 bubbles during the long-term operation at a large current density (j at 200–1000 mA cm−2).18 Direct growth of nanoarrays with a 1D or 2D unique structure on conductive substrates (copper/nickel foam, carbon paper, etc.) is an efficient way to enhance the electroactivity and stability because the strong interaction between nanoarrays and conductive substrates can boost the conductivity and durability, especially under high current conditions.19–21 However, most of the reported conductive substrate-supported catalysts are synthesized by the hydrothermal method.22 But the complex process results in uneven load and difficulty in adjusting the structure of the catalyst, which are not conducive to fully realize the activity of the catalyst. So, it is necessary to explore a more convenient and efficient synthesis of CoP@C based self-supporting bifunctional electrocatalysts for HER and OER.
Herein, a 1D novel N-doped carbon nanowire array encapsulated CoP nanoparticle hybrid supported on copper foam (CoP@NCNWAs/CF) is prepared by using 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) as the precursor through a chemical impregnation–cation exchange–phosphating strategy. The theoretical and experimental results reveal that NCNWAs reduce the binding energy of the Co atom in CoP, which helps in lowering the H2O dissociation energy. Moreover, NCNWAs impede the production of excess CoOOH due to the confinement effect, thus forming abundant CoP/CoOOH interfaces which greatly reduce the reaction energy barrier of the OER rate determining step. Owing to the synergistic effect between CoP and NCNWAs and the open 3D architecture, the CoP@NCNWAs/CF exhibits outstanding HER and OER activity with low overpotentials (η) of 166 and 287 mV at a j of 100 mA cm−2, respectively. More importantly, the CoP@NCNWAs/CF based electrolyser only needs low cell voltages of 1.48 and 1.69 V to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm−2 for OWS and enables long-term operation at a j of 400 mA cm−2 with nearly negligible decay.
Experimental
Reagents and materials
All the reagents used in this experiment were obtained from commercial suppliers and directly used without further purification. Copper foam (CF) was supplied by Shenzhen Green and Creative Environment Science and Technology Co., Ltd. 7,7,8,8-Tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), acetonitrile (MeCN), and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were bought from Shanghai McLin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium hypophosphite hydrate (NaH2PO2·H2O), and Nafion (5 wt) were purchased from Energy Chemical. Argon (Ar) gas was supplied from Messer. Deionized water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm obtained from an ultra-pure water purification system (Millipore-Q) was used in all experiments.
Preparation of Cu(TCNQ)/CF
The synthesis of Cu(TCNQ)/CF was according to the previous reports but with a few slight modifications.23,24 In the typical synthesis procedure, three pieces of CF (1 cm × 1 cm) were well cleaned by sonication sequentially in hydrochloric acid (3 M), deionized water, and ethanol for 10 minutes before use to remove the surface oxides and impurities. The cleaned CF was dipped into a 7 × 10−3 M TCNQ/MeCN solution at 60 °C for 2.5 h. The solution turned green and the CF surface turned purple, indicating the formation of Cu(TCNQ). The sample was then rinsed several times with deionized water and dried prior to the next step.
Preparation of Co(TCNQ)2/CF
Co(TCNQ)2/CF was prepared via the cation exchange method. In the typical synthesis procedure, the as-obtained Cu(TCNQ)/CF was immersed in 10 mg mL−1 Co(NO3)2·6H2O/MeCN solution at 60 °C for 3 h. The sample was rinsed several times with deionized water and dried prior to the next step.
Preparation of CoP@NCNWAs/CF
In the typical synthesis procedure, a piece of as-prepared Co(TCNQ)2/CF (1 cm × 1 cm) and 400 mg of NaH2PO2 were placed at two separate positions in a porcelain boat with NaH2PO2 at the upstream side of the tube furnace. The samples were annealed under an Ar atmosphere for 1 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and then naturally cooled to ambient temperature. Phosphidation was performed at temperatures of 300 °C, 350 °C, and 400 °C to study the influence of the phosphidation degree on the electrocatalytic performance. The loading of CoP@NCNWAs/CF-350 is 5.8 mg cm−2.
Material characterization
The microstructures of the samples were analyzed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; S-4800, Hitachi) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Tecnai G2-F20) operating at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. A Bruker D8-Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation as the X-ray source and a wavelength of 1.5406 Å was used for X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis to record the crystal phase of different samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Phi X-tool instrument using Al Kα) was performed to obtain the elemental compositions and chemical states of the materials. For the core-level spectra, the carbon 1s feature located at 285.0 eV was used to calibrate the binding energies.
Electrochemical measurement
All electrochemical measurements were performed in a typical three-electrode setup with an electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Inc., Model CHI 760E) at room temperature. For the three electrode tests, the self-supported CoP@NCNWAs/CF was directly applied as the working electrode, with a graphite rod as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode. All potentials were presented here with 95% iR compensation and calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the conversion formula: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + 0.197 V.
The HER and OER performances were evaluated in a N2-/O2-saturated 1.0 M KOH solution, respectively. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was carried out at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The Tafel slope is derived from the polarization curves according to the Tafel equation, η = blogj + a, where η, j, and, b represent the overpotential, current density, and Tafel slope, respectively. The electrochemical durability was first examined using an accelerated durability test (ADT) by continuous cyclic voltammetry (CV) scanning for 3000 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in the voltage range from 0 to −0.2 V (HER) and from 1.2 to 1.5 V (OER) vs. RHE. The current–time (i–t) chronoamperometric response was tested at the overpotential corresponding to the current density of 100 mA cm−2. CV curves were measured in a potential window with no faradaic processes under different scan rates (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mV s−1) to calculate the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl). The slope of the plot of current density differences versus the scan rates is twice the value of Cdl. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) can be calculated from the equation ECSA = Cdl/Cs, where Cs is the specific capacitance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed by conducting alternating current (AC) impedance tests at the applied potential corresponding to the overpotential of 100 mV for HER and 300 mV for OER within the frequency range of 100 kHz–0.01 Hz. The electrolyte resistance (Rs) was derived from EIS plots and used for iR compensation with the equation EiR-corrected = Eoriginal − I × Rs.
For the overall water splitting test, two pieces of the as-prepared CoP@NCNWAs/CF catalysts were directly used as the cathode and anode in a two-electrode configuration. For comparison, the noble metal couple Pt/C || RuO2 was also tested. The polarization curves were recorded at a rate of 5 mV s−1 within the potential range from 1.0 V to 2.0 V and the stability tests were carried out under a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 at room temperature.
DFT calculations
DFT calculations were performed with the open-source planewave code, Quantum Espresso. In all calculations, the spin polarized generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and ultrasoft pseudo-potentials were used for the core electrons. The plane-wave cutoff energy was set to “fine”. The convergence of forces and energy on each atom during structure relaxation were set to 0.04 eV Å−1 for force and 10−6 eV for energy, respectively. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid. The vacuum space along the z-direction was more than 15 Å, large enough to avoid interplanar interactions. The unit cell of CoP was in the Pnma symmetry group, respectively. For computing the hydrogen adsorption energy, layer slab models of pure CoP, N-doped CoP and CoOOH were used. The heterogeneous interface model was built using CoP(101) and N-doped C(001) as well as CoP(101) and CoOOH(001) with a matching error of less than 5%. For geometry optimization of all slab models, the top two layers were allowed to relax.
The computational hydrogen electrode was used to obtain adsorption energies for each state. The free energy of hydrogen adsorption on CoP(101), N-doped C(001), and the N-doped C/CoP hybrid nanostructure was calculated by using the following equation: ΔG = ΔEH* + ΔEZPE − TΔS(1) ΔEH* = E(surface+H*) − (EH* + Esurface)(2)where E(surface+H*) and Esurface denote the energy of substrates with an adsorbed H atom and the energy of bare substrates, ΔEH* denotes half of the energy of H2, ΔZPE is the variation in zero-point energies and ΔS is the change in entropy before and after the reaction. T is temperature and equals to 298 K. Therefore, the free energy of the adsorbed state can be taken as ΔG = ΔEH* + 0.24 eV.
The free energy of OER adsorption on the CoP(101) and CoOOH/CoP hybrid nanostructures was calculated by using the following equation: * + H2O(l) → *OH + e− + H+(3) *OH → *O + e− + H+(4) *O + H2O(l) → *OOH + e− + H+(5) *OOH → * + O2(g) + e− + H+(6)where * stands for an active site on the catalyst surface, (l) and (g) refer to the gas and liquid phases, respectively, and *OH, *O and *OOH are adsorbed oxygenated intermediates.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 schematically illustrates the preparation process of the CoP@NCNWAs/CF catalyst, which mainly involves three steps. Firstly, Cu(TCNQ) nanorod arrays (NRs) on CF (Cu(TCNQ)/CF) are prepared by a facile chemical impregnation method (Cu + TCNQ → CuTCNQ). The CF shows a 3D open structure (Fig. S1†). Then, by a room-temperature cation exchange between Cu+ and Co2+, Cu+ ions in Cu(TCNQ) nanorods are replaced by Co2+ to fabricate Co(TCNQ)2/CF. Finally, CoP@NCNWAs/CF was obtained by phosphatizing Co(TCNQ)2/CF with NaH2PO2 as the phosphorus source at 350 °C for 1 h in flowing Ar. The morphology and structures of the as-prepared samples are first characterized by SEM and TEM measurements. In Fig. 2a, the CF is completely covered by Cu(TCNQ) NRs with smooth surfaces. It is noteworthy that after cation exchange between Co2+ and Cu+, the as-obtained Co(TCNQ)2/CF (Fig. 2b) still retains NR features but only gets slightly thicker. Impressively, after the phosphating treatment, one can find that numerous nanoparticles are formed on the surface (Fig. 2c). On further observing the TEM images (Fig. 2d), one can find that CoP@NCNWAs/CF displays a unique capsule nanostructure with hollow interiors and the CoP nanoparticles (NPs) are encapsulated in NCNWAs. The phase details of CoP@NCNWAs/CF are first analyzed by HRTEM (Fig. 2e), in which well-defined lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 2.50 Å can be observed which correspond to the (111) facet of orthorhombic CoP.25 Moreover, the SAED pattern (Fig. 2e inset) exhibits clear diffraction rings of CoP(011) and CoP(111), which is further verified by the HRTEM result. Furthermore, as depicted in Fig. 2f, the SEM and EDS-based mapping images reveal the even distribution of C, N, Co, and P over the entire sample and the corresponding content is 30.63, 11.70, 21.28, and 36.39 wt%, respectively, close to the ICP-AES result (Table S1†). Altogether, all these characterization results confirmed the successful preparation of the CoP@NCNWs/CF catalyst.

The crystalline phases of the as-obtained samples are further recorded by XRD analysis. In Fig. S2 and S3,† the diffraction peaks of TCNQ, CuTCNQ, and Co(TCNQ)2 are well-matched with the reported XRD results. After phosphating, seven characteristic diffraction peaks can be observed (Fig. 2f), belonging to the (011), (111), (112), (211), (103), (301) and (203) planes of CoP,26,27 respectively, which further indicates that CoP is successfully synthesized. The elemental compositions and valence states of CoP@NCNWs/CF are analyzed by XPS measurements. The XPS full spectrum (Fig. S5a†) implies that CoP@NCNWs/CF is composed of Co, C, N, and P elements, identical to the result of the TEM-mapping analysis. The presence of the O element may be due to the absorbed H2O or surface oxidation, and the signals of Cu are from the copper foam substrate. The asymmetric C 1s spectrum (Fig. S5b†) can be divided into three peaks at 284.5, 285.3, and 288.6 eV, corresponding to the sp2 C, C–N/CN, and O–CO bonds,28 respectively, confirming the formation of N-doped carbon matrices. For the N 1s spectrum (Fig. 2h), the peaks at 398.7 and 400.0 eV can be assigned to the pyridinic N and pyrrolic N, respectively.29,30 The high-resolution P 2p spectrum can be fitted with three peaks (Fig. S5c†), and the peaks at 129.0 and 130.2 eV can be ascribed to P 2p3/2 and P 2p1/2 of Co–P species,31 respectively, further confirming the existence of CoP, while the peak at 133.8 eV reflects the existence of the P–O groups from the phosphates species due to the exposure to air.32 The Co 2p XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 2i, in which the peaks at 782.3 and 798.0 eV can be allocated to Co2+ and the peaks at 786.3 and 803.5 eV correspond to the satellite peak (sat.).25 More importantly, the binding energy of Co 2p in CoP@NCNWAs/CF obviously shifts toward lower energy as compared to CoP/CF, suggesting that there is a strong electronic interaction between CoP/NCNWAs, i.e. the electron from NCNWAs transfer to CoP. The electron-rich Co sites produced by the localized structural polarization can reduce the energy barrier of water dissociation during the reaction, which is beneficial for accelerating the HER.
The HER and OER electrocatalytic performances of CoP@NCNWs/CF are explored using the standard three-electrode configuration in 1.0 M KOH solution. For comparison, Pt/C, RuO2 and CoP/CF are also studied. Fig. 3a demonstrates the HER LSVs of all samples, where Pt/C displays a remarkable HER activity with a low overpotential of 91 mV to drive 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3b). However, its maximum current density can reach only 200 mA cm−2 due to the severe peeling off of Pt/C from the CF support. It is noteworthy that CoP@NCNWs/CF shows excellent performance with η values of 85 and 163 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, better than those of CoP/CF (112 and 295 mV). Moreover, we also explore the influence of the phosphating temperature on the HER performance of CoP@NCNWAs/CF. As shown in Fig. S6,† CoP@NCNWAs/CF-350 exhibits the optimized activity among the three samples. Impressively, the CoP@NCNWs/CF catalyst is comparable to and even superior to many non-noble-metal-based self-supported electrocatalysts reported recently (Table S2†). In order to understand the HER kinetic mechanism, Tafel plots are obtained based on the LSVs. Of note, CoP@NCNWAs/CF displays a lower Tafel slope of 43.46 mV dec−1 than CoP/CF (175.2 mV dec−1), which is even comparable to that of Pt/C/CF (31.18 mV dec−1) (Fig. 3c). According to the corresponding value of the Tafel slope, the HER process of CoP@NCNWAs/CF follows the Volmer–Tafel mechanism (Volmer reaction: H2O + e− → OH− + H*, Tafel reaction: 2H* → H2), in which the chemical desorption is the rate determining step (RDS).33

(h) The TEM image (inset: the SAED pattern) and (i) the HRTEM image of CoP@NCNWAs/CF, respectively. 
Electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) calculation and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are carried out to further understand the cause for the increased HER activity. By seeing the EISs in Fig. 3d, one can find that CoP@NCNWAs/CF possesses a lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) of only 3.0 Ω during the HER process, much smaller than that of CoP/NF, which indicates that CoP@NCNWAs/CF shows a faster electron transfer rate. In addition, as shown in Fig. S7,† the electrochemical double-layer capacity (Cdl) for the HER process is analyzed by the CV method in the non-faradaic potentials range (0.0–0.1 V vs. RHE), and the Cdl values of CoP@NCNWAs/CF and CoP/CF are 100.89 and 66.3 mF cm−2 (Fig. 3e), respectively, suggesting that CoP@NCNWAs/CF shows a larger ECSA than CoP/CF, which can provide more exposed active sites. In order to ignore the influence of ECSA, the normalized HER LSVs are also analyzed as shown in Fig. S8† and the results suggest that NCNWAs can enhance the intrinsic activity of CoP to some degree. The lower Rct and higher intrinsic activity, to some degree, can explain the reason for the high HER performance of CoP@NCNWAs/CF.
Apart from the electrocatalytic performance, high durability is also a key parameter for practical applications. The HER stability of CoP@NCNWAs/CF is analyzed by the accelerated durability test (ADT) and the chronoamperometry (i–t) test. As presented in Fig. 3f, the i–t curves of the HER reveal that after continuously running for 36 h at 100 mA cm−2, there are barely any decrease in current density compared to CoP/NF. Similarly, after 3000 CV cycles (Fig. 3f inset), the HER LSV of the CoP@NCNWAs/CF catalyst showed negligible catalytic degradation relative to the initial curve. The above results suggest that CoP@NCNWAs/CF possesses high robustness and durability for HER in the 1.0 M KOH solution. To better understand the excellent HER stability, the morphology and phase of CoP@NCNWAs/CF after the long-term HER test are analyzed by XRD and TEM analyses. As shown in Fig. 3g, the XRD pattern shows that the CoP phase did not change significantly after a long time HER test. The TEM image (Fig. 3h) shows that the morphology of CoP@NCNWAs/CF did not change significantly. Moreover, the SAED patterns (Fig. 3f inset) and HRTEM images (Fig. 3i) further indicate that the CoP phase can be retained. The clear diffraction rings and lattice fringes of CoP(111) can be observed. The results show that the structure and the active site of CoP@NCNWAs/CF are well maintained after a long-term HER test, thus ensuring the excellent stability of the HER.
Subsequently, the OER performances of the as-prepared samples are also tested in Fig. 4a, in which CoP@NCNWAs/CF shows the most optimal OER electroactivity in 1.0 M KOH solution. Its η values are only 210 and 280 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4b), respectively, much better than those of RuO2/CF (240 and 320 mV) and CoP/CF (250 and 380 mV). Also, it is clearly found that the sample annealed at 350 °C displays the optimized OER activity (Fig. S9†). The corresponding Tafel plots (Fig. 4c) show the smallest Tafel slope value of CoP@NCNWAs/CF (73.2 mV dec−1) compared with those of CoP/CF (96.1 mV dec−1), and RuO2/CF (132 mV dec−1). More importantly, as shown in Table S3,† one can find that the CoP@NCNWs/CF catalyst also shows better OER electroactivity than most reported advanced catalysts. From the EIS (Fig. 4d) and ECSA analyses (Fig. 4e and Fig. S10†), one can find that CoP@NCNWAs/CF also displays a smaller Rct (2.0 Ω) and a larger Cdl (15.55 mF cm−2) compared to CoP/CF (6.0 Ω, 8.16 mF cm−2) during the OER process, meaning the positive effect of cation exchange and phosphidation on the enhanced charge transferability. Moreover, the normalized LSV shows that CoP@NCNWAs/CF has higher intrinsic activity towards the OER. In addition, the durability test of CoP@NCNWAs/CF was conducted in the same way as the HER. The ADT and i–t results (Fig. 4f) demonstrate negligible catalytic activity degradation for CoP@NCNWAs/CF towards the OER after 3000 CV sweeps or 36 h of electrolysis at 100 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH, which suggests that CoP@NCNWAs/CF also has excellent OER stability compared to CoP/NF under alkaline conditions.

During the OER process, CoP as the catalyst suffers from severe refactoring and the real active sites should be the reconstructed species, not CoP itself.34 To clarify the real active site and the outstanding activity, the samples after a long-term OER test are characterized by XRD, XPS, and TEM. The CoP crystalline phases can still be observed in the XRD pattern of CoP@NCNWAs/CF (Fig. 4g), and the new characteristic diffraction peaks at 20°, 39°, and 51° belong to the (003), (012), and (015) planes of β-CoOOH, respectively,35 while there are only β-CoOOH phases in the XRD pattern of CoP/CF after the OER test, which suggests that NCNWAs can effectively inhibit excessive surface reconstruction of CoP to form CoOOH. The P 2p and Co 2p spectra further confirm the above results. In Fig. 4h, the peaks of P 2p3/2 and P 2p1/2 for CoP@NCNWAs/CF can still be found, but the peaks for CoP/CF disappear completely. Moreover, the Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 4i) shows that Co3+ was generated on the surface of the sample after the OER test, and the ratio of Co3+ in CoP/CF is higher than that of CoP@NCNWAs/CF. From the TEM image in Fig. S12a,† the morphology of CoP@NCNWAs/CF does not change significantly compared with the initial sample. Besides the CoP phase, the SAED and HRTEM images (Fig. S12b and c†) also display the diffraction rings and lattices of β-CoOOH, and there are clear interfaces between CoP and CoOOH. Based on these facts, it is reasonable to conclude that the in situ formed CoOOH/CoP species act as the real activity site for the OER.
In order to further clarify the most likely active sites in the actual reaction process, the Gibbs free energies of the CoP and CoP/CoOOH interfaces in the OER and the CoP, N–carbon, CoP/N–carbon interfaces in the HER process are calculated, respectively (Fig. S13†). Due to the different types of active species in different reactions, different analyses are performed separately. First of all, the process of HER (Fig. 5a) involves three steps, namely H2O dissociation, proton adsorption (H*), and H2 desorption. As shown in Fig. S14,† compared to CoP (4.83 eV), the CoP/NC interface shows a lower H2O adsorption energy of about −5.95 eV, indicating that H2O is more easily adsorbed at the interface and activated to OH− and H*, thus improving the Volmer process. Meanwhile, according to the Sabatier principle,36 the catalyst with the best adsorption strength can be judged by calculating the adsorption energy of H*. The free energy changes in Fig. 5b show that the ΔGH value of NC is relatively large, so it exhibits extremely weak H adsorption. Further analysis showed that the ΔGH value of the Co site at the CoP/N–carbon interface is closer to the zero point, which is more conducive to H* adsorption/desorption, indicating that it is the main HER active site in CoP@NCNWAs/CF.

(c) Side-view schematic models showing the pathway of the OER on the CoP/CoOOH interface. (d) Theoretical calculations of free energy diagrams for the OER. (e) Projected DOS and d bands of CoOOH, CoP/CoOOH interface, CoP/carbon interface, and CoP. 
The OER reaction process (Fig. 5c) calculation was based on a typical 4e− mechanism including the formation of the intermediates of *OH, *O, *OOH, and O2, and the surface Co centers of the heterojunction are most likely to act as the adsorption sites of the oxygen intermediates. Note that the difference in the adsorption energy between the ΔG*OOH and ΔG*O intermediates, which is the third elementary step (from *O to *OOH) (Fig. 5d), is a key descriptor for the OER activity of the CoP/CoOOH interface. One can see that the formation of *OOH on the CoP/CoOOH interface exhibited a relatively low energy barrier of 1.76 eV as compared to the key descriptor (from *OH to *O) on pristine CoP (ΔG = 1.84 eV). That is, the CoP/CoOOH interface is anticipated to exhibit a higher electrocatalytic activity because of the optimized electronic structures and lower reaction energy barrier.
Furthermore, from the calculated density of states (DOS), one can see that the CoP/CoOOH interface manifests metallic character with a zero-band gap and the d-states are closer to the Fermi level (EF) as compared to pristine CoP (Fig. 5e). The d-band center (Ed) values of Co at the CoOOH and CoP/CoOOH interfaces are −2.39 eV and −2.3 eV, indicating that the distance between Ed and the Fermi level of Co atoms at the CoP/CoOOH interface is smaller. The up-shift of the d band energy of the CoP/CoOOH interface indicates that the antibonding energy states rise and the interaction between the adsorbates and hetero-interface is strengthened, which is a critical step towards enhanced OER. Meanwhile, compared with CoP, the d-band center of CoP/NC is −3.25 eV and the distance of the d-band center is far away from the Fermi level, indicating that the adsorption of H on CoP/NC is relatively weak, further indicating that the CoP/N–carbon interface has good HER activity.
Encouraged by the outstanding HER and OER electrocatalytic activity and durability, we further assessed the OWS activity using two pieces of the as-prepared CoP@NCNWAs/CF as both the cathode and anode. For comparison, the noble metal couple RuO2/NF||Pt/C/NF was also tested. The test device is illustrated in Fig. 6a. From the LSVs of OWS (Fig. 6b), the CoP@NCNWAs/CF catalyst displays a superb water splitting activity with a cell voltage of 1.48 V to achieve 10 mA cm−2, superior to the RuO2/NF || Pt/C/NF electrolyzer (1.52 V). In addition, the cell voltage of CoP@NCNWAs/CF is only 1.83 V at a large current density of 400 mA cm−2. Moreover, one can find that the CoP@NCNWAs/CF-based electrolyzer can basically remain stable at 400 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH for at least 120 h (Fig. 6b inset). As shown in Fig. 6c, the ratio of H2 to O2 produced by EWS is close to 2:1 and the efficiency is close to the theoretical value. Further comparison shows that the electrolysis activity of CoP@NCNWAs/CF is even comparable to many other advanced electrocatalysts reported recently (Fig. 6d).20,37–53 The results imply that CoP@NCNWAs/CF has excellent electroactivity and durability towards OWS, thus showing its huge potential for practical applications.

Conclusion
In summary, an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst, nitrogen-doped carbon nanowire array encapsulated CoP nanoparticles supported on copper foam (CoP@NCNWAs/CF), is successfully prepared through a chemical impregnation–cation exchange–phosphatizing strategy. CoP@NCNWAs/CF exhibits outstanding bifunctional activity and stability towards the HER and OER, requiring overpotentials of 163 and 280 mV to drive 100 mA cm−2, respectively. More importantly, low cell voltages of 1.48 and 1.69 V are needed at 10 and 100 mA cm−2 for OWS, which enable long-term operation with nearly negligible decay. By the analysis of the theoretical calculation and experiment, we attributed such high activities to the following reasons: (1) the 1D NCNWAs and 3D CF enhance the mass and charge transfer in the catalytic reaction; (2) the CoP/NCNWA interface reduces the H2O dissociation energy and optimizes H adsorption, thus promoting the HER performance; (3) the confined effect of NCNWAs restrains the excessive reconstruction of CoP and effectively generates and protects high OER activity sites (CoP/CoOOH interface) during a long term test. This work provides a feasible idea for the design of CoP-based catalysts with high efficiency and stable catalytic activity for water electrolysis.
