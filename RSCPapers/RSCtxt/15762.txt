    , Accepted 30th April 2020First published on 30th April 2020AbstractExploration of photovoltaic materials has received enormous interest for a wide range of both fundamental and applied research. Therefore, in this work, we identify a CsSi compound with a Zintl phase as a promising candidate for photovoltaic material by using a global structure prediction method. Electronic structure calculations indicate that this phase possesses a quasi-direct band gap of 1.45 eV, suggesting that its optical properties could be superior to those of diamond-Si for capturing sunlight from the visible to the ultraviolet range. In addition, a novel silicon allotrope is obtained by removing Cs atoms from this CsSi compound. The superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of this phase was estimated to be of 9 K in terms of a substantial density of states at the Fermi level. Our findings represent a new promising CsSi material for photovoltaic applications, as well as a potential precursor of a superconducting silicon allotrope.
Introduction
The search for a candidate material for harvesting solar energy has attracted great attention, since it is a promising and available renewable resource for its abundant, clean, and sustainable merits.1–5 Photovoltaics (PV), as important materials for harvesting solar energy, could directly convert sunlight into electricity, where silicon-based materials are commonly accepted to be the most common PV materials.6,7 Compared to non-silicon-based PV materials, such as GaAs, CdS, CuInSe2, silicon-based materials have their own advantages, including stability, nontoxicity and low cost. However, silicon's indirect fundamental band gap (1.1 eV) and much wider direct band gap (3.4 eV)8 are still far from the optimal value (around 1.4 eV) for solar cell applications.9 Silicon can react with other elements to form a variety of stable binary Zintl phases, which were named after the pioneering chemist Eduard Zintl.10 Zintl phases are intermetallic compounds that contain a strongly electropositive metal, such as an alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, or lanthanoid, and a somewhat less electropositive metal (typically from the late d block or the early p block).11–14 In Zintl silicides, electron charge could transfer to the silicon atoms from other elements, forming a variety of sub-network structures with Si–Si covalent bonds.14–16 In the past few decades, Zintl silicides have drawn much attention owing to their excellent physical and chemical properties.17–32
Among Cs–Si Zintl silicides, CsSi, Cs8−xSi46 and Cs7Si136 have been studied experimentally. The ambient pressure phase of CsSi is thought to adopt the KGe structure type (space group P3n, Z = 32),33,34 while the high-pressure phase adopts the NaPb structure type (space group I41/acd, Z = 32).35 Meanwhile, it is found that the Clathrate-I phase of Cs8−xSi46 and the Clathrate-II phase of Cs7Si136 can be obtained using CsSi as a starting material via under high pressure or thermal decomposition.36,37 Recently, a semiconducting Imm symmetry CsSi6 phase is predicted.38 Moreover, alkali metal silicides are found to be important precursors in the preparation of new silicon allotropes, which can be synthesized by oxidation or thermal decomposition to remove the metal atoms.39 For example, a new Cmcm-Si6 phase with a quasi-direct band gap near 1.3 eV was obtained by removing Na from Na4Si24.40 Furthermore, an Imm symmetry Si allotrope with a band gap of 1.17 eV is predicted to be stable after removing Cs from Imm CsSi6,38 and also, a metallic P6/m-Si6 allotrope with an interesting Tc of 12.2 K at ambient pressure was proposed via a P6/m-NaSi6 compound as a precursor.41
As mentioned above, it is still required to search for new PV materials for scientific interests and potential applications. In this work, we predict a new CsSi compound with a Zintl phase at ambient pressure. Electronic structure calculations reveal that it is a semiconductor with a quasi-direct band gap of 1.45 eV. Moreover, the optical properties of this phase exceeded those of diamond-Si (dia-Si) as indicated by the simulations. CsSi, based on our simulations, could be a precursor material to synthesize a Immm symmetry silicon allotrope by removing the Cs atoms. Immm-Si4 is dynamically and thermally stable, and also exhibits remarkable superconductivity feature at atmospheric pressure.
Computational details
CsSi compounds are predicted at ambient pressure via the CALYPSO (Crystal structure Analysis by Particle Swarm Optimization) methodology,42,43 combined with first-principles calculations. This method has been successfully used for the prediction of new stable and mestastable materials.44–47 The ab initio structural relaxations and electronic property calculations were performed within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).48 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)49 functional was used to approximate the electronic exchange and correlation interaction. We used projector augmented wave (PAW)50 potentials with 5s25p66s1 and 3s23p2 electrons treated as valence electrons for Cs and Si atoms, respectively. An energy cutoff of 700 eV and dense Monkhorst–Pack k-meshes were used to ensure the total energies were converged to within around 1 meV per atom in the structural optimizations. Phonon calculations were performed to determine the dynamical stability of the predicted structures using a supercell approach as implemented in the PHONOPY package.51 Since the semi-local DFT PBE functional is known to underestimate the band gap of the predicted structures, the hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof functional (HSE06)52 was used to calculate the electronic and optical properties. The electron phonon coupling constant was obtained from first-principles density-functional perturbation theory as implemented in the QUANTUM ESPRESSO package.53 Ultrasoft pseudopotentials and an energy cutoff of 80 Ry were employed, with a 3 × 5 × 5 q-grid and a 12 × 20 × 20 k-grid. The broadening which was converged to within 0.001 was 0.04 Ry.
Results and discussion
Herein, the computational prediction of novel CsSi structures was carried out using the particle swarm method with simulation cells of up to four formula units at ambient pressure. Our structure search identified a previously unknown orthorhombic CsSi Zintl phase (space group I, 16 atoms per cell), as shown in Fig. 1. In our predicted I-CsSi structure, silicon atoms form an isolated tetrahedron, corresponding to the typical characteristics of Zintl monosilicides with an alkali metal. At ambient pressure, the optimized lattice parameters are a = 10.107 Å and c = 7.022 Å, with Cs atoms occupying the 8g (0.112, 0.259, and 0.909) and Si atoms occupying the 8g (0.115, 0.96, and 0.619) Wyckoff sites. A Bader charge analysis54 revealed that 0.68e are transferred from the Cs atoms to the Si atoms in I-CsSi.

The phase stability of I-CsSi was investigated by calculating the enthalpy of formation, which is given via ΔH = [H(CsSi) − H(Cs) − H(Si)]/2, where H(CsSi) is the enthalpy of I-CsSi, H(Cs) is the enthalpy of elemental bcc Cs, and H(Si) is the enthalpy of elemental Si in the diamond structure. The formation enthalpies of the known P3n and I41/acd-CsSi phases were also considered in our simulations. The enthalpy of I41/acd-CsSi is lower than that of the Pn structure above 3.3 GPa, indicating that the I41/acd phase becomes stable above this pressure, which is consistent with the experimental preparation of I41/acd-CsSi at 4 GPa.35 Our results revealed that ΔH of I-CsSi is −0.032 eV per atom at ambient pressure, which is 27 and 50 meV per atom higher than that of I41/acd and P3n-CsSi, respectively. To investigate the dynamic stability of I-CsSi, we computed the phonon dispersion curves at ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 2a. There is no imaginary frequency in the whole Brillouin Zone, demonstrating the dynamically stable nature of our predicted I-CsSi. The I-CsSi compound is thus a low-lying metastable phase. Upon increasing the pressure to 49.2 GPa, I-CsSi becomes enthalpically more favorable than P3n-CsSi, although I41/acd still remains the most stable phase.

For materials used in PV devices, the band gap is a critical parameter because the conversion efficiency from sunlight into electrical power is a function of the band gap. The electronic band structure of I-CsSi was calculated, as shown in Fig. 2b. It is well known that the PBE functional normally underestimates the band gap, while the screened hybrid functional of Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof (HSE) usually gives more accurate electronic band gaps. I-CsSi was calculated to have a band gap of 1.42 eV with the HSE06 functional, and 0.92 eV with the PBE functional, from the minimum of the conduction band at the M-point to the maximum of the valence band close to the Γ-point along the Γ–Z direction. The direct band gap of I-CsSi, which is located at the M-point, was 1.45 eV with the HSE06 functional (0.93 eV with PBE), indicating that I-CsSi is a semiconductor with a quasi-direct band gap.
To further explore the potential applications for photovoltaic devices, we simulated the optical absorption spectrum of I-CsSi using the HSE06 functional, as shown in Fig. 3. The absorption spectrum of the dia-Si phase is also simulated for comparison with the reference air mass (AM) 1.5 solar spectral irradiance.55 For I-CsSi, the absorption of low-energy photons starts from ∼1.5 eV, which is close to its band gap. The I-CsSi phase exhibits considerably stronger absorption than dia-Si in the visible light range of 1.7–3.2 eV, and the absorption spectrum overlaps significantly with the solar spectrum. The decrease of the direct optical band gap as compared to that of dia-Si is beneficial for improving the absorption, thus, the photo current of the solar cell. This suggests that the I-CsSi phase could potentially be employed in highly efficient Si-based solar cells.

It is well known that Zintl phases play a critical role as precursors for the synthesis of Si and Ge allotropes or other metastable compounds using chemical oxidation and thermal decomposition. Thus, the Cs atoms in the I-CsSi structure were removed to obtain the pure silicon allotrope. After full structural optimization, the phase evolved into a new orthorhombic silicon allotrope with the Immm space group (Fig. 4a). This Immm-Si4 phase contains open channels formed from six-membered Si rings along the crystallographic c axis, and differs markedly from the tetrahedral motifs present in the I-CsSi structure.

(c) Phonon dispersion, Eliashberg spectral function, and electron phonon coupling integral, as well as (d) the band structure and total densities of states of the Immm-Si4 phase at ambient pressure. 
It has been found experimentally that the silicon sublattice of the product differs from that of the precursor in the formation of Ge allotropes by oxidation of Na12Ge17 or Na4Ge9.56,57 The Na atoms template the formation of the Ge136 framework as the [Ge4]4− and [Ge9]4-polyanions are oxidized and are then emptied from the clathrate framework cages as the reaction progresses.39 The transformation of polyanionic clusters into the Ge136 framework requires not only new Ge–Ge bonds to be formed but also existing Ge–Ge bonds to be broken.39 At ambient pressure, the optimized lattice parameters of Immm-Si4 are a = 6.195, b = 3.248, and c = 3.496 Å, with Si atoms occupying the 4e (0.191, 0.5, 0.5) Wyckoff sites. The bond lengths of Si1–Si2 and Si1–Si3 are 2.495 and 2.368 Å, respectively (Fig. 4a).
The total energies of the experimentally known dia-Si, R8,58,59Cmcm-Si6,40 and Fdm-Si13660 phases, and the theoretically predicted Immm-Si4, and P6/m-Si641 phases of silicon were calculated. Fig. 4b shows that dia-Si is the most thermodynamically stable phase, as expected. The total energies of Cmcm-Si6 and P6/m-Si6 are 0.09 eV per atom and 0.35 eV per atom higher than that of dia-Si, respectively, which is in good agreement with previous computations.41 Moreover, the energy of Immm-Si4 is lower than that of Fdm-Si136, a phase that has been synthesized using thermal decomposition.60Fig. 4c shows no imaginary frequencies are observed in Immm-Si4 throughout the whole Brillouin zone, indicating that it is dynamically stable at ambient pressure.
To further understand the electronic properties, we calculated the band structure and density of states of Immm-Si4, as shown in Fig. 4d. The results indicate that Immm-Si4 exhibits metallic behavior. The previously reported pure Si allotropes are almost semiconductors except the recently proposed metallic P6-m Si phase with a Tc of 12.2 K at ambient pressure.41 Therefore, we calculated the electron–phonon coupling constant, λ, from first-principles density-functional perturbation theory, and the superconducting critical temperature, Tc, was estimated using the Allen–Dynes-modified McMillan formula,61,62 with a Coulomb pseudopotential μ* of 0.1. The logarithmic average of phonon frequencies, ωlog, and λ obtained from the Eliashberg spectral function, α2F(ω), was 259 K and 0.70, respectively. Our results predict that the Immm-Si4 allotrope is a superconducting phase with an estimated Tc of 9 K at ambient pressure.
Conclusions
In summary, we predicted an I-CsSi compound via crystal structure search carried out at ambient pressure. Compared to the known CsSi phases, it is thermally metastable and dynamically stable. Electronic structure calculations indicate that I-CsSi has a quasi-direct band gap of 1.45 eV, which perfectly matches the optimal value of ∼1.4 eV for solar cell applications. The calculated optical absorption of I-CsSi reveals that its optical properties are superior to those of dia-Si. Moreover, a novel silicon allotrope of Immm-Si4 was obtained by removing Cs atoms from the I-CsSi compound followed by structural relaxation. Immm-Si4 is dynamically stable at ambient pressure with an estimated Tc value of 9 K. Immm-Si4 is 0.05 eV per atom more stable than the previously synthesized Fdm-Si136 phase, indicating that it is likely to be synthesized in the lab. Our current results represent that I-CsSi is not only a new promising material for photovoltaic applications, but also a potential precursor of a novel superconducting Immm-Si4 allotrope.
