    , Accepted 13th August 2022First published on 16th August 2022AbstractQuasi two-dimensional (Q-2D) perovskite cells have attracted much attention due to their excellent stability compared to their 3D counterparts. However, the Q-2D perovskite thin films prepared by the solution method have been confirmed to be a mixture of small-n phases and large-n phases instead of a pure phase, where the amount and distribution of these phases have a great significance on the performance of Q-2D perovskite solar cells. Here, commercialized 3D perovskite powder was simply added to an ACI perovskite precursor solution to get a uniform and closely connected heterostructure in which the large-n phases can work as pathways for charge transfer. The characterization results of the films and devices show that the appropriate amount of MAPbI3 in the precursor solution could distribute the 3D phases homogeneously within the final film to promote the photovoltaic performance of the devices. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency of the Q-2D ACI perovskite solar cell has been increased from 10.4% to 13.82% (with a 32.8% performance improvement).
1. Introduction
2D perovskites formed by breaking the infinitely connected octahedral 3D structure with large-size organic cations show better long-term stability than 3D perovskite materials and are expected to replace their 3D counterparts as light-absorption layers in solar cells, and are thus being widely studied by researchers.1 The large-size insulating organic spacer can effectively protect the 2D perovskite layers from water and oxygen, improving their air stability.2,3 At the same time, these large-size organic cations can block ion migration, resulting in better electrical stability of the 2D perovskite materials.4 Q-2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with super-high stability were first reported in 2014, and showed negligible decomposition after exposure to ∼50% relative humidity (RH) for 46 days.5 Despite their inspiring stability, these devices only had a PCE of 4.73%, lagging far behind their 3D counterparts.5 It is necessary to improve the PCE of Q-2D PSCs to maximize the advantages of Q-2D perovskite materials.
There are many reasons for the low efficiency of 2D PSCs. In the 2D perovskite structure, a quantum well structure is formed by two insulating organic layers and one conductive inorganic layer, resulting in a quantum confinement effect.6 Accordingly, 2D perovskites have wider band gaps, weaker light absorption and higher exciton binding energies compared to 3D perovskites.7,8 These intrinsic optoelectrical properties of fixed-n (n is the number of inorganic octahedral layers) 2D perovskites result in their poor photovoltaic performance when used as a light-absorbing layer in solar cells. At the same time, a crystal orientation unfavorable to charge transfer is easily formed in the small-n phases.5 Generally, 2D perovskite films with larger n values show better photovoltaic performances and lower stability. Among the three types of 2D perovskite materials, perovskites with alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI perovskites), which have a large organic cation spacer located in the organic interlayer alternating with the A-site cations, have greater photovoltaic potential than Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) and Dion–Jacobson (DJ) 2D perovskite materials due to the relatively close distance between the inorganic layers.9–11 Organic cation spacers like GA+ can form an ACI perovskite with small exciton binding energy, reduced band gap width and other unique characteristics.12–14
Besides, when Q-2D perovskite films are prepared by the simple and convenient solution method, both large-sized organic spacer cations and A-site organic cations are in the precursor solution. The coexistence of organic cations with different characteristics makes the crystallization of Q-2D perovskite films a complicated process.15 Liu et al. confirmed that the films prepared by the solution-processed method were mixtures of perovskite phases of different n values, including both small-n phases and large-n phases, instead of the pure phase of single n value.16–18 The charge transfer and/or energy transfer between low dimensional phases and the 3D phase in the thin film relates to this phase mixture, which is obviously affected by their components and distributions. Some researchers have already demonstrated this by varying the amount of the 3D phase in the film by changing the molar ratio of ammonium iodide in the precursors (that is, changing the n value).19 The energy level mismatch and energy loss among different phases are the key reasons for the PCE decline of Q-2D perovskite cells.20 In previous studies, Q-2D perovskites with small to large n are found vertically distributed in the films from bottom to top, which is believed to be a beneficial phase distribution because of its cascade energy alignment for better transferring of electrons and holes simultaneously.21–23 Another way to avoid the energy loss is to obtain 2D perovskite with pure phase (n value is definite). Efforts such as large organic cation selection by crystallographic data analysis and first-principles calculations, using a single crystal of 2D perovskites to prepare precursor solution, adding additives, and so on were made by researchers to fabricate 2D perovskite films with pure phase.20,24,25 Besides the pure phase and vertical phase distribution, the uniform phase distribution has also been proved to be the way out for high performance Q-2D PSCs. Zhang et al. introduced vacuum poling treatment to accelerate nucleation during crystallization, thus getting an even distribution of perovskite phases with different n values in the film.26 For the ACI perovskite, it is composed of microcrystals where the ACI perovskites are crystalized in the 3D perovskite networks. It was confirmed that the tightly bound excitons in 2D phases thus could transfer their energies to 3D phases and then separate into free charge carriers due to the weak exciton binding energy in the 3D or 3D-like phase perovskite.27,28 Cheng et al. also showed experimentally that ultrafast charge transfer appears at these 2D/3D hybrid perovskite heterostructures.29 Consequently, the existence of 3D phases and phase distribution play an important role in charge transport and photovoltaic performance.
In view of the great significance of 3D phases and phase distribution of the Q-2D ACI perovskite, here, different amounts of commercialized 3D MAPbI3 powder are introduced into the precursor of the ACI perovskite in order to adjust the phase composition and distribution. The influence of 3D MAPbI3 on the ACI films and the devices is explored by several techniques. It is proved that with the proper amount of 3D phases, a uniform large-n phase distribution and a stronger connection between phases can be achieved. The PCE is enhanced from 10.4% of the reference without adding MAPbI3 to 13.82% of the device with optimized MAPbI3 addition, which stems from more large-n phases in the films and uniform phase distribution. Compared with perovskite solar cells made of 3D perovskite films, both devices made of Q-2D ACI perovskite film with and without 3D MAPbI3 addition show excellent stability with negligible degradation of PCE after storing in the nitrogen-filled glove box for two months.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
Methylammonium iodide (MAI, >99.99%), lead(II) iodide (PbI2, >99.99%), lead(II) chloride (PbCl2, >99.99%), (PEDOT:PSS, Clevious PVP Al4083), and fullerene (C60, >99.9%) were brought from Sigma-Aldrich. Solvents used in this work, including N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethyl alcohol, and chlorobenzene (CB), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Guanidinium chloride (GACl, >99.5%) was purchased from Adamas. Bathocuproine (BCP, >99%) was purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. The commercialized 3D perovskite (MAPbI3, >99%) was purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. The chemicals mentioned above were used without further processing and purification.
The ACI perovskite precursor was prepared by dissolving 0.175 M GACl, 0.7 M MAI, 0.7 M PbI2, (GACl:MAI:PbI2 = 1:4:4, n = 4) in a co-solvent of DMSO and DMF (vol. ratio = 9:1) in a glove box followed by stirring overnight at room temperature. For the ACI perovskite precursors with 3D additives, 0.0310 g (0.05 M), 0.0620 g (0.1 M), and 0.2170 g (0.35 M) were added respectively into the pristine ACI perovskite precursor.
The 3D perovskite precursor was prepared according to our previous report by dissolving 1.4 M CH3NH3I, 1.26 M PbI2, and 0.14 M PbCl2 in a co-solvent of DMSO and DMF (vol. ratio = 9:1) in a glove box followed by stirring overnight at room temperature.
2.2 Fabrication of solar cells
The glass/ITO substrate was firstly cleaned with deionized water with 5% detergent (Decon 90) and then washed with pure deionized water four times in an ultrasonic cleaning machine (KQ3200DV). Once cleaned, the PEDOT:PSS solution was spin coated on the ITO substrate at 6000 rpm for 40 s, followed by annealing at 120 °C for 25 min in air. After annealing, the substrate with a PEDOT:PSS film was transferred to the nitrogen-filled glove box once it cooled down to room temperature. For the preparation of the Q-2D ACI perovskite film, a hot-casting method was applied, i.e., preheating the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate on an 85 °C hot plate for 10 min before spin-coating. After preheating, the substrate was transferred to the spin-coater immediately. The ACI perovskite film was prepared by a two-step spin-coating method with 400 rpm for 3 s and then 4000 rpm for 30 s. During the second step, the CB (200 μL) was dropped on the spinning substrate at the 11th second before the end of the second step. After that, the perovskite film was annealed at 85 °C for 25 min. Then, 40 nm C60 and 10 nm BCP were deposited as the electron transport layer and buffer layer, respectively. Finally, 100 nm Ag was thermally evaporated on top of the BCP film at ≈10−6 Torr as the electrode to complete the device fabrication.
2.3 Characterization
The current–voltage (J–V) measurement was performed by a Keithley 2400 source meter. The device was illuminated by a solar simulator (Newport, 94043A) under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2). During the test, the J–V curves were recorded by scanning the voltage from +1.2 to −0.2 V with a voltage step of 10 mV with no delay time. The surface morphology and grain size of the perovskite films were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-6700F). The ultraviolet absorption spectrum was tested by Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrometer. The crystallization of the perovskite film was investigated by an XRD-7000 X-ray diffractometer (XRD) from SHIMADZU, Japan, at a speed of 4° min−1. A lock-in amplifier (SR-830) was employed to record the photocurrent generated from the modulated monochromatic light. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the device was recorded by calculating the photocurrent and the light intensity obtained with a lock-in technique. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were taken on an FLSP920, and the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained with an FLS 980 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd) and the excitation source is a 365 nm laser. The laser was irradiated from the perovskite side. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were measured by ESCALAB 250Xi photoelectron spectrometer (calibrated by the C 1s carbon peak (284.8 eV) under the standard lens mode with a step of 1 eV). EIS diagrams were measured using the CHI6600d Electrochemical Workstation in dark room.
3. Results and discussion
Here, the precursor solution of the pristine film was prepared according to a molar ratio of GA+:MA+:Pb2+ = 1:4:4 (n = 4) at a concentration of 0.7 M. The structure of ACI phase perovskite (n = 4) is illustrated in Fig. 1a. The typical hot-casting and anti-solvent method were applied in the perovskite film preparation process.30,31 Different amounts of 3D MAPbI3 (0.05, 0.1, 0.35 M) were added to change the content and distribution of the 3D phase in the final film (Fig. 1b). The Q-2D ACI perovskite film prepared in the above described manner was used as a light-absorbing layer in solar cells with a p-i-n structure, as demonstrated in Fig. 1c. Here, the molar ratio of our precursor is GACl:MAI:PbI2 = 1:4:4, in which case MACl may leave the film surface during the thermal annealing process. Thus, the chemical formula of the ACI perovskite here is described as GAMAPb4IxCl13−x. With the introduction of 3D MAPbI3, the amount of 3D phases, which are beneficial for light absorption and charge transport in the films, are absolutely increased compared with the one without the addition of 3D MAPbI3. Furthermore, the proper amount of 3D MAPbI3 added to the precursor may change the crystallization process of the ACI film and lead to a favorable phase distribution. Further characterization and analysis of the film and devices were carried out to confirm the above conjectures.

(d) XRD patterns of the 0–0.35 M 3D MAPbI3 samples without annealing. (e) UV-Vis absorption spectra of the 0–0.35 M 3D MAPbI3 samples without thermal annealing. 
To explore how the 3D MAPbI3 changes the crystallization processes, the XRD of thin films with different amounts of added 3D MAPbI3 before annealing was conducted, and the results are shown in Fig. 1d. Weak diffraction peaks appear at positions less than 10°, corresponding to the phases with low n value and the intermediate phases formed with DMSO.32 Diffraction peaks at around 12° and 16° marked with asterisks are mainly attributed to a series of (00k) reflections of (GAMA)MAn−1PbnI3n+1 with different n values.33 Charge carrier transport along the vertical direction will be hindered by the 2D spacer layers, and thus crystal growth in the (00k) direction should therefore be avoided. With the increasing amount of 3D MAPbI3, the marked diffraction peaks became weaker and then disappeared when 0.35 M 3D MAPbI3 was added, indicating that the introduction of 3D MAPbI3 changed the crystallization process of the perovskite film and reduced the orientation, which was not beneficial for charge transfer.34
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of unannealed films are shown in Fig. 1e. Due to the existence of the quantum limiting effect of the low-dimensional perovskite phases, apparent exciton absorption peaks corresponding to different n values appear, which is considered to be strong evidence of the existence of small-n phases.35 Obvious exciton absorption peaks can be observed with or without the addition of 3D MAPbI3, but no obvious absorption band edge can be observed, indicating that the small-n phase can be formed after spin coating and anti-solvent dropping without annealing, mainly due to the low nucleation potential barrier of these phases.34,35Fig. 1e showed exciton absorption peaks at 590 and 625 nm, corresponding to the phases of n = 2 and 3, respectively, consistent with previous reports on ACI perovskite films.36 When the amount of 3D MAPbI3 is increased to 0.35 M, the intensity of the exciton absorption peak is weakened, and the light absorption of the short wavelength declined, indicating that the content of the low-dimensional phase in the crystallization process decreases with the increase of 3D MAPbI3. The light absorption in the short wavelength range shows a decreasing trend, which also proves that the small-n phases mainly absorb the light in the short-wavelength range, while the 3D phase has a stronger light absorption ability in the long wavelength range. Ultraviolet absorption spectra confirmed that the introduction of the 3D phase does regulate the crystallization process, and the content of low-dimensional perovskite phase shrinks.
To explore the influence of 3D MAPbI3 addition on film quality and phase distribution, the steady state PL spectra excited from the front perovskite side and back glass side, respectively, from 560–815 nm were carried out and are presented in Fig. 2a and d. When excited from the perovskite side, emission peaks corresponding to small-n phases and 3D phases can be seen. When 0.05 to 0.1 M 3D MAPbI3 was added, the peak intensity turned out to be stronger, which means fewer defects and better film quality. However, when 3D MAPbI3 was increased to a large proportion (0.35 M), the emission peak corresponding to 3D phases declined a lot unexpectedly. It can be concluded that the increase of 3D phases is not always beneficial to the performance improvement of Q-2D perovskite solar cells. It may be related more to the phase distribution and carrier transport in the film, which deserves special attention. The enlarged PL spectra from 690 to 820 nm are shown in Fig. 2b and e. With 0.05 M 3D MAPbI3 added, the red shift of the peak scan cannot be distinguished. The peak intensity increased further, and the red shift of the emission peak can be clearly observed when 0.1 M 3D MAPbI3 was added. The peak intensity dropped significantly, and the red shift disappeared with 0.35 M 3D MAPbI3 addition. The occurrence of the red shift may stem from the increase in 3D phase content in the film to decrease the thickness of the quantum well and then reach saturation. In addition, the PL spectra excited from the front and back sides show some obvious differences in the short wavelength range, as shown in Fig. 2c and f. The excitation peaks at different wavelengths are assigned to low-dimensional phases with different n values, where the chemical formula is GAMAPbnIxCl3n+1−x (GACl:MAI:PbI2 = 1:n:n). Arrows are used to directly mark the corresponding two-dimensional perovskite phase. In the case of 0.35 M MAPbI3, the emission peak with a low n value is the weakest when excited from the back side and the strongest when excited from the front side, which indicates that the phase with a small-n value is distributed close to the surface of the film. Otherwise, the smallest difference was found with 0.1 M MAPbI3, where the phases with low n value distribute uniformly in the film. In brief, the introduction of the 3D phase not only changes the content of the stable low-dimensional phase and the 3D phase in the film, but also affects the phase distribution in the entire film. The introduction of a suitable amount of 3D MAPbI3 (0.1 M) enables the film to have better uniformity and stronger interlayer interaction.

The high-resolution XPS spectra of Pb 4f, I 3d, N 1s, and Cl are shown in Fig. 3a–d. In the Q-2D perovskite film, after introducing 0.1 M 3D perovskite in the precursor, the shape and position of the characteristic peaks of each element are almost exactly the same, indicating that the chemical environment (chemical bond) stays the same as before.

Careful analysis showed that the two peak positions coincided completely, but there were differences in binding energy shift. The spectra of several elements are further analyzed. Lead, iodine, and nitrogen are the characteristic elements of 3D commercial perovskite. Through comparative analysis, the binding energy of lead, iodine, and nitrogen moved to the low binding energy by 0.19, 0.17, and 0.22 eV, respectively, with the introduction of 3D perovskite. The blue shift of binding energy indicates the strong interaction between 2D perovskite and 3D perovskite after the introduction of additives, which is attributed to the increase in electron cloud density around lead, nitrogen, and iodine. It is noted that the content of chlorine is very low, which may be caused by the volatilization of GACl/MACl during thermal annealing.

Fig. 4a shows the XRD patterns of the annealed films. The diffraction peaks assigned to the low n phases (as shown in Fig. S1†) disappeared compared to the pristine film, which will be more beneficial for charge transfer. As can be seen from the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the annealed film in Fig. 4b, within the whole wavelength range, the light absorption of the ACI film with 3D addition is significantly enhanced. The exciton absorption peaks corresponding to n = 2, 3 phases still exist after thermal annealing, but the peak intensity reduced considerably. We speculate that the smaller size MA+ can move easily during thermal annealing to transform the 2D ACI phases to 3D phases. The absorption band edge of the annealed film appears at near 780 nm, which proves the existence of the 3D phase.37 With 0.35 M 3D MAPbI3 added, the absorption spectrum is very close to the 3D perovskite film, which shows strong absorption in the whole wavelength range. Fig. 4c shows the corresponding TRPL decay spectra of the ACI perovskite films. The TRPL spectra were fitted with a bi-exponential function: Y = A1exp(-t/τ1) + A2(-t/τ2) + Y0, where τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes for the fast and slow recombination, respectively.38,39 The corresponding charge carrier lifetimes are summarized in Table S1.† For ACI perovskite film without 3D MAPbI3 addition, τ1 = 95.22 ns, and τ2 = 427.83 ns. For ACI perovskite film with 0.1 M 3D MAPbI3 addition, τ1 = 146.66 ns and τ2 = 992.27 ns. Both τ1 and τ2 of the film with 0.1 M MAPbI3 are longer than that of the film without MAPbI3 addition. The MAPbI3-optimized film has a longer lifetime compared to that of the pristine film, which suggests significantly reduced defect density and suppressed trap-induced non-radiative recombination losses in the perovskite layer.40,41 The low n phases have a passivation effect when distributed uniformly around the large n value phases for better contacts. TRPL results showed that the Q-2D perovskite films with different n value nano-plates uniformly dispersed showed a longer carrier lifetime. Simultaneously, a sudden lifetime decline appears with 0.35 M 3D MAPbI3. Though there are abundant 3D phases with excellent photovoltaic properties, a more uneven phase distribution was formed for the 0.35 M case. In this situation, the low-dimension phases may work as traps and carrier recombination centers.

Then, the photovoltaic performance of devices based on the ACI films with different amounts of 3D MAPbI3 was analyzed under the illumination of AM 1.5G simulated light, as presented in Fig. 4d, and its photovoltaic performance parameters are shown in Table S2.† It can be seen that when the amount of 3D MAPbI3 is relatively small, the photovoltaic performance is slightly improved. Compared with the reference sample, the Jsc of all devices was increased after adding 3D MAPbI3, reaching the maximum of 17.31 mA cm−2 when 0.1 M 3D MAPbI3 was added. The PCE increased to 13.82% accordingly. However, further increasing the amount of 3D MAPbI3 to 0.35 M declined the photovoltaic performance to a relatively low level (Voc = 0.951 V, Jsc = 16.95 mA cm−2, FF = 73.53, PCE = 11.85%). Nevertheless, the Jsc of the device made of the 0.35 M MAPbI3-ACI film is smaller than the 0.1 M MAPbI3-ACI device, which is the result of uneven phase distribution as described above. Further characterizations of EQE measurements were performed to confirm the J–V measurements.
The EQE and integrated Jsc are shown in Fig. 4f. The wider bandgap and inefficient charge transfer of the low-dimensional perovskite phase are the reasons for the lower Jsc of devices made of low-dimensional perovskite than that of its 3D counterpart. The Q-2D perovskite films show a relatively poor light absorption, and it has proved to be very sensitive to the thickness of the light-absorbing layer.18Fig. 4f indicates that the EQE of the optimized device has been improved in the whole wavelength range. This indicates that the light absorption and charge generation efficiency of ACI films are enhanced successfully by regulating the phase distribution inside the films, which is also consistent with the results of UV-Vis absorption spectrum. The integral current increased from 15.3 to 17.3 mA cm−2, which is also consistent with the Jsc obtained in Fig. 4e.
Here, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is performed to understand the charge transport and recombination behavior (Fig. 5). We fitted the Nyquist plot and displayed the resistance value in Fig. 5. The series resistance and charge transfer resistance (Rct) showed little difference in the high-frequency area. Yet, the composite resistance (Rrec) is much larger for the optimized device, indicating much less charge recombination and higher Voc.

To investigate the influence of GACl and MAPbI3 on the crystallization kinetics, we performed an in situ PL test (excited from the bottom of the substrate at 405 nm) during the spin-coating process. As shown in Fig. 6a–d, the difference is mainly reflected in the content amount of low dimensional phase and three-dimensional phase under different conditions. The control film shows an intense signal of the 3D phase. The 3D phase signal becomes weaker when more MAPbI3 is added. For the whole spin coating process, the introduction of the 3D phase is beneficial to prolong the existence time of the two-dimensional phase in the spin coating crystallization process and then affect the content and distribution of the low-dimensional phase and three-dimensional phase in the mixed phase film. According to the device performance results and the previous analysis, when 0.1 M MAPbI3 is introduced, the content and distribution of the low-dimensional phase and three-dimensional phase in the thin film are most favorable to the device performance.

Based on the above analysis, a corresponding model of the phase distribution and charge transfer in the ACI perovskite thin film is established in Fig. 7. In the pristine film, phases with low n value surround and gather together, where the pathway of the photogenerated and tightly bound exciton is blocked (Fig. 7a). With the proper amount of 3D additions, the formation of low-dimensional perovskites of small n value decreased, and there were more phases with larger n value (n ≥ 4). The introduction of 3D phase additions improves the crystallinity, phase distribution, light absorption, and charge transfer efficiency of the ACI perovskite film, improving the device performance. It is worth noting that further 3D additions did not result in a higher PCE because the phase distribution, crystal orientation, trap density, and so on may not be at the ideal state.

The effect of the 3D MAPbI3 addition on the ACI films can also be traced from the morphological properties of the ACI perovskite thin films directly. The top-view FESEM images of the pristine ACI films and ACI films with added 0.1 M 3D MAPbI3 are demonstrated in Fig. 8a and b, respectively. It can be seen clearly that the surface of the pristine film is very rough, and layered grains are stacked together. For the 0.1 M 3D MAPbI3 added film, the layered grains become wider and flatter, and the distribution is more orderly and uniform. In previous studies, GA+ was used to replace a certain proportion of MA+ in 3D perovskite. When the proportion of GA+ increased to a certain ratio, 2D perovskite peaks appeared in XRD, but significant differences could not be observed in the morphological images.42 Particularly, the difference between adding the commercialized MAPbI3 and the separated MAI and PbI2 of the same molar ratio was further distinguished through morphological properties directly. With 0.1 M (MAI + PbI2) added, the obvious rod-like grains extending to several micrometers can be seen (Fig. 8c), which is caused by the incompatibility of 1D and 2D perovskite phases according to previous reports on the crystallization transition process of ACI perovskites.36 It has been reported that in the crystallization process of low-dimensional perovskite, the 3D phase can be used as a template for 2D phase growth.43 We speculate that this may be the reason why 3D perovskite acts differently from MAI + PbI2 as an addition. The amplified FESEM images are shown in Fig. S2.† The J–V curves of 40 devices were prepared and measured under the same situations to track the reproducibility, and the results are shown in Fig. 9a. In order to analyze the stability of the devices, the stability of the device in the glove box was tracked (Fig. 9b). The device of 3D films kept about only 75% of its initial PCE after storing it for 36 days in the glove box. However, after storing for two months, the efficiency of the ACI perovskite solar cell device remained over 85% of its initial PCE, demonstrating better stability. It is worth noting that the GA chosen in this study is not the best choice for air stability. GA+-based ACI perovskite films show inferior environmental stability compared to other 2D perovskite materials due to the amino group, which is hydrophilic.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we improved the photovoltaic performance of Q-2D ACI perovskite solar cells by introducing the commercialized 3D MAPbI3 into the perovskite precursor. It is confirmed to be a simple and effective way to manipulate the content and distribution of small-n and large-n phases in Q-2D ACI perovskite films. In our work, we highlighted the role of the large-n phases, where a strong connection between phases and effective charge transport is achieved. In view of the phase-impurity properties of the Q-2D perovskite films, it is crucial to control the phase distribution inside the film for better photovoltaic performance.
