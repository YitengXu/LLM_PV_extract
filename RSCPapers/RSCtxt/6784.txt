    , Accepted 30th March 2007First published on 20th April 2007AbstractWe investigated the influences of the titania precursor chemistry and hydrothermal temperature in the sol–gel procedure on the growth of TiO2 nanocrystallites. The nanocrystallites were prepared either from Ti(OiPr)4 (OiPr = isopropoxide) in acetic acid solution or from Ti(OiPr)3(OAc) (OAc = acetate) in water followed by nitric acid acidification. Nanocrystallites formed from the first method were 20–40% larger than those produced from the second method. The average size of calcined TiO2 nanocrystallites formed from Ti(OiPr)4 varied from 16–36 nm over the hydrothermal temperature range of 180–300 °C, while the average size of those prepared from Ti(OiPr)3(OAc) varied from 13–23 nm over temperatures of 200–250 °C. Significantly, the size of the crystallites displayed a linear dependence on the hydrothermal temperature. Crystal growth in acetic acid was enhanced in the [001] direction with increased autoclave temperature, whereas crystallites formed in the presence of nitric acid grew less rapidly in the [001] direction. The mechanisms for the preferential growth direction of the nanocrystals are discussed.
Introduction
Titanium dioxide nanostructures have been widely investigated as materials for solar cells,1 photocatalysis,2,3 optoelectronic devices,4 photoelectrochromic windows,5 and sensors.6 For these applications, the forms of titania—their crystal size, shape, and structure—are critically important to their performance. The simplest and most commonly reported synthetic procedure for preparing TiO2 nanostructures is the sol–gel method in which titanium alkoxide or titanium chloride precursors are hydrolyzed in an aqueous solution. Nanoparticles,7 nanowires,8,9 nanotubes,10,11 and ordered 2- and 3-dimensional porous films12 are just some of the architectures available to researchers via sol–gel chemistry. Despite the research advances in this area, it is still challenging to predict a priori the crystal size and structure from a particular synthetic protocol. Furthermore, the reproducible synthesis of small-batch TiO2 nanocrystals remains a challenge. The synthetic knowledge to vary systematically the morphological and electronic properties of nanostructured systems in a reproducible way is important for advancing both fundamental and applied research. This is especially true for TiO2 nanoparticles used in the fabrication of mesoporous films for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs; Grätzel cells),13,14 one of the promising unconventional future technologies of interest to the solar cell community. For instance, varying the particle shape can affect the particle packing density, which, in turn, can alter light harvesting15 and electron transport in TiO2 films.16 Variation in the particle density (porosity) changes the average coordination number of particles in films, the consequence of which alters the electron transport pathway and, therefore, the electron dynamics.15
Although the sol–gel process is the general method for preparing TiO2 particles for DSSCs, small differences in the syntheses can affect the film morphology and, consequently, the solar conversion efficiency. Synthetic parameters known to influence the TiO2 particle size, shape, and crystal structure include the titania precursor, the acid catalyst used in hydrolysis, and the autoclave pH, time and temperature.7,17–21 For instance, varying the autoclave temperature has led to particles with sizes between 10.8–14.5 nm.7 It would be advantageous to have the synthetic knowledge to vary the size of nanocrystals over a wider range without significantly affecting the nanocrystal shape. Having this capability was critical for recent studies that identified the location of transport limiting sites in TiO2 nanocrystalline films and quantified the effect of varying the film surface area on recombination.22,23 The synthetic procedure for altering the particle size and the effect of certain sol–gel parameters on the nanocrystal shape were not published at that time, however. To our knowledge, no synthetic procedure has been reported for controlling the growth of TiO2 nanocrystallites over a broad range of sizes and a narrow range of shapes.
In this paper, we present the results of our investigation of the influence of the titania precursor chemistry and hydrothermal (autoclave) temperature on the growth of TiO2 anatase nanocrystals. The crystallites were prepared by two methods that differed in the titania precursors, acid catalysts, pHs, and hydrothermal temperature ranges. Nitric acid and acetic acid—two of the most commonly used acids for TiO2 particle synthesis by the sol–gel route24—were selected for the reaction media. By varying the acid and autoclave temperature, the size of the crystallites can be adjusted systematically over a wide range, from 13–36 nm. At a given autoclave temperature, smaller TiO2 particles were produced from the hydrolysis of Ti(OiPr)3(OAc) (OiPr = isopropoxide; OAc = acetate) in nitric acid solution than from the hydrolysis of Ti(OiPr)4 in acetic acid solution. Significantly, the crystallites displayed a linear growth dependence on the autoclave temperature. Unexpectedly, when the hydrothermal temperature was increased, TiO2 crystal growth in acetic acid was enhanced in the [001] direction, whereas particles formed in nitric acid grew at a lower rate in the same direction.
Experimental
Starting materials
Titanium isopropoxide (Aldrich, 97%) and concentrated nitric acid (Fisher) were used without further purification. Glacial acetic acid and 2-propanol were distilled prior to use. Water was doubly distilled in air; the resistivity of the resulting water was 0.4 MΩ cm. All preparations were performed under ambient conditions (average relative humidity <40%) unless otherwise noted. The conducting glass plates (TCO; LOF TEC8 F-doped SnO2 glass; Hartford Glass Company), which were used as the substrate for deposited films, were cleaned ultrasonically in isopropanol and acetone, rinsed with water, and then dried under a gaseous nitrogen stream.
Synthesis

Fig. 1 outlines schematically the two synthetic routes (Methods A and B) used for preparing the TiO2 nanocrystals.
 Fig. 1  Synthetic schemes (Methods A and B) for preparing TiO2 nanocrystals via the sol–gel process. 

Method A: Water (160 mL, 8.9 mol) and glacial acetic acid (51 mL, 0.89 mol) were added to a 500 mL round bottom flask. After cooling the solution to 0 °C, a mixture of 2-propanol (6.0 mL, 0.078 mol) and Ti(OiPr)4 (24 mL, 0.081 mol) was added dropwise to the vigorously-stirred solution over 30 min. The mixture was heated to 78 °C over 1 h and held at this temperature with stirring for another 3.5 h while blowing a gentle stream of nitrogen (ca. 1 L min−1) into the neck of the flask to aid evaporation of 2-propanol.
The resulting colloidal solution was concentrated via rotary evaporation to 200 mL ([Ti] = 0.4 M; pH 1.9) and loaded into a Teflon insert of a 600 mL titanium autoclave (Parr Instrument Company; pure grade 4 titanium; total reactor volume with insert was 520 mL). The autoclave was heated in a convection oven to 180, 200, 250, or 300 °C over 1 h and then held at the desired temperature for 12 h. After cooling, the mother liquor containing the crystalline TiO2 nanoparticles was transferred to a beaker and sonicated using a Branson Sonifier 450 cell disruptor equipped with a Ti tip (duty cycle 70%, power 8, 5 min) to break up aggregates and re-suspend the crystals. The resulting milky-white colloid was concentrated to 12 wt% TiO2via rotary evaporation (total colloid weight ca. 52 g). A portion of the 12 wt% TiO2 colloid (5.00 g, 0.60 g TiO2) was combined with hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC, MW = 80000, Aldrich, 0.300 g, 50 wt% with respect to TiO2), and this mixture was stirred at room temperature for at least 24 h until the HPC had dissolved fully.

Method B: This preparation was adapted from the literature.20 A beaker was loaded with Ti(OiPr)4 (31.7 g, 0.108 mol, Aldrich, 97%) in air and then covered with parafilm. A slow N2 stream was introduced over the Ti(OiPr)4. Acetic acid (6.49 g, 0.108 mol) was added dropwise, via an addition funnel, to the stirred Ti(OiPr)4 over 10 min, producing Ti(OiPr)3(OAc) as a pale-yellow liquid. After stirring for 15 min, the modified precursor was quickly poured into vigorously stirred water (157 mL), which resulted in the immediate formation of a white precipitate. After this mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature, the colorless solution had a pH of 2.8. Concentrated nitric acid (2.16 mL, 70% solution, 0.034 mol) was then added to the solution. The acidified mixture (pH 1.4) was heated to 78 °C over 45 min at which point it was held at this temperature for 75 min while a gentle stream of nitrogen was blown into the neck of the flask to aid evaporation of 2-propanol as in the case of Method A. The resulting slightly translucent bluish sol was concentrated via rotary evaporation to 150 mL, then added to the Teflon liner of the Ti autoclave as in Method A. The flask was rinsed with water (2 × 25 mL) to ensure complete TiO2 recovery and to bring the total solution volume to 200 mL. The combined sol and washes (pH 1.1) were heated in the titanium autoclave over 1 h to 200, 220, 230, or 250 °C and held at the desired temperature for 12 h.
After adding 1.3 mL of concentrated HNO3 to the cooled sol and precipitated solids, the mixture was sonicated using the cell disruptor as described for Method A and then concentrated via rotary evaporation to 18 wt% TiO2 (total colloidal solution weight 46.7 g). The colloidal solution was partitioned between four 60 mL centrifuge tubes, and the solids were separated at 12000 rpm (15 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was discarded, and the TiO2 nanoparticles were washed with ethanol (3 × 40 mL for each tube) to remove excess nitric acid.
A 10 wt% ethanolic solution of ethylcellulose (EtCel, 22.2 g; 0.74 : 0.26 (w/w) Fluka 5–15 mPa s/30–50 mPa s; the EtCel dissolves with stirring over 2–3 d), ethanol (50 mL), and α-terpineol (39.2 g, Aldrich, 90%) was added to the as-washed nanoparticles, and the mixture was dispersed using the cell disruptor discussed above. The resulting thin paste was mixed using an IKA Ultra Turrax T25 disperser (5 min, 20–24000 rpm). This sonication and dispersion process was repeated two additional times to ensure a homogeneous mixture. Ethanol was removed via rotary evaporation, giving a moderately viscous, pale-beige paste. The paste was smoothed on a 3-roll mill for ca. 20 min before being stored in a sealed vessel under ambient conditions.
Mesoporous TiO2 films were deposited via the doctor blade method using the TiO2 nanoparticle pastes from Methods A and B on TEC8 substrate. Wet films were dried on a hot plate by heating at 120 °C for 30 min (ramp rate 2 °C min−1) and then calcined at 450 °C for 30 min (ramp rate 2 °C min−1). The films were about 12 µm thick. The nanoparticles were characterized after calcination.
Characterization
TiO2 nanoparticle films were characterized using a Bruker Scintag X-ray diffraction (XRD) system (CuKα radiation (λ = 1.540598 Å); 45 kV; 36 mA; 15° < 2θ < 90°; scan rate 4.00°/min). The average crystallite size was calculated from the Scherrer equation using the anatase (101) reflection at 2θ = 25.3°.25 Within the detection limit of 3–5%, only the anatase crystal phase was observed for particles prepared from both Methods A and B at all autoclave temperatures. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained with a Phillips CM-30 instrument operating at 200 kV. Average particle sizes and standard deviations for each sample were determined by the average length and width of each particle from a population of 130 individual particles. Surface area, porosity, and pore volume were determined by nitrogen sorption measurements from a Quantachrome NOVA 2000 high-speed sorption analyzer and calculated by applying the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method to the desorption isotherm.
Results and discussion

Fig. 2 and Table 1 compare the effects of autoclave temperature on the growth of TiO2 anatase nanocrystallites prepared from the precursor Ti(OiPr)4 in acetic acid solution (Method A) and from the precursor Ti(OiPr)3(OAc) in water followed by nitric acid acidification (Method B). The sizes of the particles are seen to increase with temperature, a phenomenon attributed to Ostwald ripening in which the dissolution of small crystallites, driven by the reduction of surface energy, feeds the growth of fewer but larger crystallites.7,26 The average size of calcined TiO2 crystallites formed from Method A varied from 16–36 nm over the hydrothermal temperature range of 180–300 °C, while the average size of those prepared from Method B varied from 13–23 nm over the temperature range of 200–250 °C. Significantly, Fig. 2 also reveals that the crystallites displayed a linear growth dependence on the autoclave temperature. The implication of this observation is that by simply varying the autoclave temperature, one can tune systematically the average size of crystallites. Table 1 demonstrates that as the particle size increases, the surface area of the film decreases and the pore size increases in concurrence with expectations from geometric considerations and with the observation of others.7,26

Fig. 2 and Table 1 show that TiO2 particles formed from Method A are 20–40% larger than those synthesized from Method B at the same autoclave temperature. The distinct precursor, acid, and pH used in the two methods (Fig. 1) are expected to strongly influence the difference in crystallite growth. Particle growth is a complex process,27 which begins with the exchange of isopropoxide ligands (OiPr) for hydroxyl groups. Under the aqueous acidic hydrolytic conditions of this study (pH > 1), the titanium hydroxy species condense to form a gel containing an extended network of primary particles in the form of amorphous hydrous titanium oxides TiO2·nH2O with diameters in the range of 1–5 nm.27 We find that these gels are easily disrupted by mechanical shaking, suggesting that neighboring particles comprising the network interact via weak van der Waals forces. Further crystallization, dissolution and reprecipitation (Ostwald ripening)7 are accelerated by autoclaving owing to their strong dependence on the temperature and pH.
The disparate conditions of Methods A and B are expected to influence both condensation and Ostwald ripening and, therefore, to affect particle growth. In Method A, Ti(OiPr)4 is added to an aqueous solution containing a 10-fold excess of acetic acid (with respect to Ti), whereas in Method B Ti(OiPr)3(OAc) is added to water. Although the pH of the precursor solution during hydrolysis is reported to have no substantial effect on the final crystallite size,7 acetic acid has been demonstrated to slow hydrolysis dramatically and to result in the formation of smaller and more monodisperse primary particles.28 The slower hydrolysis and longer gel time result from the chelating ability of acetic acid. Thus, the favorable condition for producing such small particles, owing to the 10-fold excess of acetic acid for Method A, promotes the growth of larger crystallites in hydrothermolysis via Ostwald ripening.7 Conversely, for Method B in which the Ti : acetate ratio is just 1 : 1, fewer small primary particles are formed, thus reducing markedly the extent of Ostwald ripening and, consequently, leading to smaller TiO2 nanocrystals produced during the autoclave step.
The higher initial autoclaving pH of the sol generated from Method A (pH = 1.9) also favors larger crystallites than those produced from Method B (pH = 1.1). Several studies show that the hydrothermal treatment of sols under basic conditions (pH > 7) leads to larger particles than that under acidic conditions.7,29 In highly acidic environments (pH < 1), condensation and crystallization do not occur until the hydrothermal step, whereas in slightly less acidic conditions (pH > 2), colloids are formed prior to autoclaving.26,30 This is due to the fact that at high acidity (pH < 1), species of the form [Ti(OH)(OH2)5]3+ are solvated and do not form primary particles during hydrothermolysis when all other parameters are fixed.31,32 The unfavorable pH condition for primary particle formation should also hinder Ostwald ripening during hydrothermolysis. Accordingly, we suggest that the smaller TiO2 crystallites formed in Method B (cf. Method A) (Fig. 2) during the hydrothermal step are due, in part, to the low pH (pH 1.1) of the solution. Conversely, the relatively higher pH used in Method A (pH = 1.9) should favor crystallite growth via the Ostwald ripening mechanism.

Fig. 3 displays the XRD diffraction patterns of the calcined TiO2 nanocrystallites that were formed from Methods A and B. The average crystallite size determined from the Scherrer equation25 applied to the anatase (101) peak at 2θ = 25.3° was 10–25% larger than the crystallite size evaluated from TEM analyses (Table 1). The Scherrer equation emphasizes larger sized particles of a population by calculating the volume-weighted average rather than the surface area-weighted average,32 whereas TEM analyses attach equal weight to particles irrespective of their volume.
 Fig. 3  XRD diffraction patterns of TiO2 nanoparticle film; particles were prepared at an autoclave temperature of 250 °C by Method A (Ti(OiPr)4 in acetic acid) and Method B (Ti(OiPr)3(OAc) in nitric acid). 
It is noteworthy that the ratio of the integrated area under the (004), (200), (105), (211), and (204) peaks with respect to the area under the (101) peak in the wide-angle XRD pattern for Method A (Fig. 3) changed only slightly over the entire autoclave temperature range. The integrated XRD data show that, upon heating from 180 to 300 °C, the crystallites become longer in the [001] direction by ca. 15% based on an increased intensity of the (004) peak. This result is consistent with experimental33,34 and theoretical35–37 studies, which show that the truncated octahedral crystal geometry, dominated by the {101} and {001} surfaces (Fig. 4b), is the most thermodynamically stable geometry for the anatase crystal phase.35,37 The observed lengthening of the crystal in the [001] direction by 15% can be envisioned as the result of elongation of the truncated bipyramidal geometry toward the fully octahedral geometry containing exclusively the {101} face (Fig. 4a). Increasing the hydrothermolysis temperature is thus expected to favor the more thermodynamically stable {101} face resulting in elongation of the nanocrystals with an increased proportion of the {101} face. These data can be understood from mechanistic studies.32 Briefly, the growth rates of TiO2 crystallites in the [001] and [101] directions vary over time. Initially the crystallites grow faster in the [001] direction than in the [101] direction, which results in a relatively lower percentage of the {001} surface. Later, the crystallites grow faster in the [101] direction until eventually the rates of growths in the two directions equilibrate such that the {001} faces reach a critical (constant) size even with further growth of the {101} faces. Adding organic compounds such as glycine is found to reduce the growth rate in the [001] direction during the initial stage of fast growth.32 Inasmuch as acetic acid binds to TiO2 surfaces similarly to glycine,32 it is reasonable to expect that the large excess of acetic acid (Method A) also suppresses initial growth along the [001] direction. Thus, as equilibrium is approached rapid growth along the [001] direction should be highly favorable. Accordingly, the lengthening of the crystallites is consistent with the subsequent faster growth along the [001] direction than along the [101] direction during hydrothermolysis. TEM images (a representative image is shown in Fig. 5) support the effect of temperature and acetic acid on the growth direction of the nanocrystals.

In contrast to the TiO2 crystallites prepared by Method A, the ratio of the integrated area under the (004), (200), (105), (211), and (204) peaks with respect to the area under the (101) peak in the wide-angle XRD pattern of crystallites synthesized by Method B (Fig. 3) show that the crystallite dimensions were shortened in the [001] direction by as much as 25% when the autoclave temperature was increased. Based on similar reasoning as discussed above, we attribute the truncated nanocrystals in the [001] direction to two factors: synthesis in nitric acid solution (Method B) rather than in a 10-fold excess of acetic acid (Method A) and the lower pH of 1.1 (cf. pH of 1.9 for Method A). Synthesis of TiO2 crystallites in acetic acid solution leads to a high proportion of {101} faces, whereas nanocrystal growth in nitric acid solution results in a much lower proportion of {101} faces.18 From these observations, it follows that acetic acid solution favors growth in the [001] direction, whereas nitric acid solution disfavors such directional growth. In addition, lower pH values reduce growth rates in the [001] relative to the [101] direction.32 Under the lower pH conditions of Method B, such slower growth in the [001] direction would result in a larger percentage of the {001} surface. Consistent with these conclusions, TEM images of particles prepared from Method B (Fig. 6) display truncated crystallites with respect to those prepared by Method A. It should be emphasized that even though Methods A and B produce distinct crystal growth patterns, in both cases the overall geometric change that occurred over the range of crystallite sizes was quite small. Thus, these synthetic procedures may be used to prepare similarly shaped nanocrystals that differ mainly in their average size.

Conclusion
The titania precursors, acid catalysts (nitric acid and acetic acid), pH, and hydrothermal temperatures are found to influence the growth of anatase TiO2 nanocrystallites in specific ways. Significantly, the crystallite size can be varied linearly over a broad range of sizes and a narrow range of shapes simply by changing the hydrothermal temperature. Furthermore, the crystal growth direction may be slightly altered by varying the acid catalyst and pH. This study makes available reproducible routes for controlling the size and shape of TiO2 nanocrystallites for use in dye-sensitized solar cells. Investigations of the consequences of these morphological changes on the photoconversion processes should lead to improved solar energy conversion efficiencies.
