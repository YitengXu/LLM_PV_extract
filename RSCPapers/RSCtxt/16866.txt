    , Accepted 31st December 2021First published on 1st January 2022AbstractRecently reported non-noble metal–iridium mixed oxides not only exhibit excellent activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in acidic media, but also reduce the cost. However, most of them fail to overcome the poor stability of amorphous iridium oxide formed on the surface after leaching of the non-noble metal. Herein, we describe a LiLa2IrO6 electrocatalyst with a thin IrO2 shell (IrO2/LiLa2IrO6) that achieves a win–win situation for both activity and stability under harsh acidic conditions. The synthesized IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 catalyst exhibits outstanding activity for the OER in 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte, and needs a low overpotential of 278 mV to deliver the benchmark of 10 mA cm−2, superior to commercially available IrO2 and most recently reported catalysts. More significantly, IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 shows enhanced electrochemical stability with only 160 mV increase in potential after testing over 13 h, in contrast to commercial IrO2 that almost lost its activity toward the OER in 7 h. This demonstrates that the high performance for catalyzing the OER is ascribed to the in situ formed IrOx highly active layer by surface reconstruction as well as the strong interaction between IrOx and bulk LiLa2IrO6.
Introduction
The increasing energy demands in modern society force humans to wisely and widely secure new energy sources.1–3 However, renewable energy sources including tidal power, solar and wind are intermittent in nature, and suffer from the regional and seasonal constraints.4,5 Therefore, advanced energy conversion and storage techniques are much required to realize the usage of these energy sources at any desired time.6–8 Due to the carbon free feature and high energy density, hydrogen has been identified as the most appropriate energy carrier.9–11 Proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis is an ideal strategy to produce hydrogen.12,13 As one of the most important half reactions, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which involves a sluggish four-electron transfer kinetic process, largely determines the energy conversion efficiency.14–16 However, the oxidative environment and harsh acidic conditions make most OER electrocatalysts noneffective.17,18 Therefore, developing efficient and stable OER electrocatalysts is of great significance in improving the electrolytic efficiency as well as promoting the industrialization of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis technology.
At present, iridium (Ir)-based catalysts are considered to be the advanced acidic OER catalysts due to their relatively adequate corrosion resistance.19,20 As we know, Ru-based electrocatalysts have satisfactory catalytic activity for the OER, but they are easily oxidized to RuO4 under highly anodic potential and consequently, dissolved in acidic media.21–23 However, IrO2 also faces similar problems, and will be oxidized under high applied potential to form IrO3 (IrVI) and then dissolved into the electrolyte.6,20,24–26 Moreover, the small reserves on earth and low activity toward the OER limit the practical application of Ir-based catalysts at scale.27 Thus, the design and development of high activity, high stability and cost-effective OER electrocatalysts in acidic media is a challenge but very worth doing. Recently, many Ir and non-noble metal mixed metal oxides, such as IrOx/SrIrO3,28 6H-SrIrO3,29 La3IrO7,30 Pr3IrO7,24 La2LiIrO6,31 SrCo0.9Ir0.1O3,32 Y2Ir2O7,33 Y2−xBaxRu2O7,34 Nd2Ir2O7,35 Gd2Ir2O7,36 and Yb2Ir2O7,37 have been developed as highly efficient OER electrocatalysts in acidic electrolytes.38,39 On one hand, their mixed metal oxide form can decrease the use of noble metals compared to the most advanced commercial iridium oxide to reduce the cost;40 on the other hand, the flexibility of composition and structure for those mixed metal oxides allows for the regulation of electronic structure and then OER performance.41–43 As is well known, alkali/rare earth metals are thermodynamically unstable under acidic conditions, and the dynamic surface reconstruction phenomenon is likely to occur on the surface of mixed oxides containing rare earth metals and alkali metals, which produces active surface oxygen atoms that act as electrophilic centres to react with water and thus greatly contribute to the OER activity.29,44,45 As reported by Alexis Grimaud and co-authors, the La2LiIrO6 electrocatalyst would undergo a drastic surface reconstruction during the OER process in acidic electrolyte and the Ir atoms migrate from the bulk to the surface. Thus, the high OER activity of La2LiIrO6 comes from the formed active surface oxygen atoms but at the expense of surface stability. Therefore, the design of new electrocatalysts for the OER requires an optimal balance of activity, stability, and cost in order to maximize catalytic performance for large-scale applications.
Herein, we report a novel IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 catalyst prepared using a simple one-step solid-state reaction as an even superior acidic OER electrocatalyst. IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 exhibited largely enhanced OER properties compared to commercially available IrO2 in 0.1 M HClO4 solution. In detail, the overpotential of the catalyst to reach 10 mA cm−2 is 278 mV, preceding the commercial IrO2 and ranking among many recently reported advanced OER electrocatalysts. The corresponding value of the Tafel slope is 45 mV dec−1, signifying faster reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the durable activity is maintained for IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 with less than 160 mV increase in potential after continuous testing for 47000 s at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, whereas the potential of IrO2 increases to more than 2 V (vs. RHE) within 30000 s under the same conditions. Further analysis demonstrates that the highly improved performance of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 toward the OER could be attributed to the in situ formed IrOx surface layer during the electrochemical process as well as the electronic interaction between IrOx and bulk LiLa2IrO6 that inhibited the peroxidation and dissolution of iridium to a certain extent. More importantly, the synthesis method can be facilely extended to fabricate other Ir and non-noble metal mixed oxides, further expanding the iridium catalyst family.
Results and discussion
The IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 catalyst was prepared through a facile one-step solid state reaction method under ambient conditions. The structure and morphology of the as-prepared IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 catalyst were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. S1,† except for a small bulge present between 15° and 25° indicating the existence of a partial amorphous structure, all the XRD diffraction peaks belong to the perovskite structured LiLa2IrO6 (PDF No. 01-073-5824) and tetragonal IrO2 with cell parameters a = b = 4.498 Å and c = 3.154 Å (PDF No. 00-015-0870). Fig. 1a shows a typical SEM image of the as-synthesized catalysts, presenting irregular polyhedral particles within 0.8–3 micrometers in diameter. The HRTEM image in Fig. 1b shows an amorphous area between two areas with excellent crystallinity, which is in accordance with the XRD analysis results. The measured lattice fringe distances of 0.22 nm and 0.31 nm are attributable to the (200) and (110) planes, respectively, of tetragonal IrO2 (Fig. 1c), while the lattice fringe distance of 0.326 nm is related to the (012) plane of perovskite LiLa2IrO6 (Fig. 1d). The inset image in Fig. 1b is the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern corresponding to the LiLa2IrO6 part, demonstrating the nature of the single crystal structure. In the amorphous region, there are fuzzy boundaries and random arrangements without lattice fringes, exhibiting structural disorder. Therefore, lattice expansion would occur to adjust the lattice difference between the crystalline and amorphous regions.46 Disordered amorphous structures can produce a mass of “dangling bonds”, providing abundant active sites with unsaturated electronic structures. This would improve the adsorption properties of the reactants. In addition, the structural flexibility of the amorphous phase facilitates the transfer of charge and electron between the active sites and the intermediates.17,47Fig. 1e–h show the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) maps, unveiling the uniform distribution of La, Ir, and O elements in the polyhedral particles.

For the purpose of further revealing the surface elemental composition and corresponding valence states of the IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 catalyst under working conditions, the advanced characterization studies of high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) were performed. Fig. S2† shows the XPS survey spectrum of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6, further manifesting that the chemical components of the catalyst are Li, La, Ir and O. Fig. 2a shows the Ir 4f XPS spectra of pristine IrO2 and IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 before and after continuous electrolysis for 1 h in 0.1 M HClO4. For IrO2/LiLa2IrO6, two doublets can be fitted for the Ir 4f spectrum: the peaks with binding energies (BEs) of 61.5 eV (4f7/2) and 64.5 eV (4f5/2) are assigned to Ir4+, and are slightly negatively shifted compared with those of pristine IrO2; while the other two peaks located at BEs of 62.4 eV (4f7/2) and 65.4 eV (4f5/2) are ascribed to Ir5+ and the adjacent two peaks are their shake-up satellites at BEs of 63.5 and 66.6 eV.30,48 These results show that the catalyst contains a mixture of Ir4+ and Ir5+, consistent with the XRD results. Moreover, the relatively small peak area of the Ir 4f peaks for the IrO2 part in IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 demonstrates the low content of IrO2 in the composite. After OER testing, the spectral shape of A-IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 (catalyst collected after OER testing in acidic electrolyte) is changed, and the peaks corresponding to Ir4+ disappear, which is attributed to the oxidation of IrO2 to IrOx during the OER process. This could contribute to the enhanced OER activity. The two remaining peaks appeared at BEs of 62.2 eV and 65.2 eV related to 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively, of Ir5+, and the doublets at 63.3 and 66.1 eV belong to their satellite peaks.32 The apparent negative shift of Ir5+ indicates that the electron density of the Ir site increases during the OER process. This may be attributable to the strong interaction between newly formed IrOx and bulk LiLa2IrO6, which inhibits the over-oxidation of surface Ir ions to IrVI and thus reduces the dissolution of Ir. This would be beneficial to the long term durability.31 The O 1s spectrum of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 in Fig. 2b shows signals of Ir–OH and Ir–O appearing at 530.4 and 531.3 eV. These two peaks are slightly shifted to higher BEs than those of pristine IrO2. The peak at 532.2 eV is assigned to oxygen of adventitious carbon species.49,50 Besides, the peak at a low binding energy of 529.1 eV belongs to the lattice O that is bound to Li or La. When undergoing the electrochemical OER process, the peak related to lattice oxygen bound to La or Li disappeared, manifesting the potential leaching of La and Li ions during the OER process. For A-IrO2/LiLa2IrO6, the O 1s spectrum shows one big peak at a BE of 531.8 eV which is related to Ir–OH, and two small peaks at 533.0 eV and 535.1 eV are assigned to the oxygen in adventitious H2O and carbon species, which are generated from the adsorbed Nafion solution that is used as a binder during OER testing. In Fig. S3,† La 3d5/2 spectra exhibit two doublet peaks with BEs of 833.5 and 835.1 eV, and the shake-up peaks at 837.2 and 838.7 eV are assigned to La3+ in IrO2/LiLa2IrO6. After OER testing, the positions and profiles of the two sets of peaks changed substantially. A large peak appears at 835.8 eV, and two small peaks are located at BEs of 829.6 eV and 838.5 eV. The considerable difference between the La 3d XPS spectra of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 before and after OER testing may be attributed to the leaching of La from LiLa2IrO6 lattices during the OER process and the re-precipitation in the form of lanthanum carbonate species on the catalyst surface. Fig. S4† shows the La 4d spectra as well as Li 1s spectra of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 and A-IrO2/LiLa2IrO6. The significant decrease in peak intensity further effectively demonstrates the leaching of La and Li during OER testing.

(d) The corresponding k3-weighted Fourier transforms of Ir LIII-edge EXAFS spectra for IrO2/LiLa2IrO6, A-IrO2/LiLa2IrO6, Ir foil, IrCl3, and IrO2. 
The iridium LIII-edge XANES spectra of references Ir foil, IrCl3, and IrO2 and IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 and A-IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 catalysts are shown in Fig. 2c, and display broad white lines corresponding to the transition from occupied 2p to empty 5d states.30 The main absorption peak of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 is at 11221.6 eV, which is positively shifted by 1.2 eV compared with that of reference IrO2, implying the higher oxidation state of Ir in hybrids than pure IrO2. However, the position of the Ir white line peak for A-IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 shifts to the lower photon energy side, demonstrating the reduction of the Ir valence state in IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 after OER testing. The presented change of the Ir valence in the prepared IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 during the electrochemical process matches well with the XPS results. The corresponding Ir LIII-edge EXAFS spectra of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6, A-IrO2/LiLa2IrO6, Ir foil, IrCl3, and IrO2 are shown in Fig. 2d. The peak associated with the Ir–O bond appears at 1.607 Å for IrO2/LiLa2IrO6, which is lengthened to 1.62 Å for IrO2, implying the higher valence state of Ir in the composite than pristine IrO2. After OER testing, the Ir–O distance of A-IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 is slightly increased (1.615 Å) compared to that of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6, again indicating the reduction of the Ir oxidation state during the electrochemical process. Accordingly, the reduced Ir oxidation state could be ascribed to the loss of oxygen on the catalyst surface according to the following equation:  The XANES and EXAFS spectra of the La K-edge for IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 and A-IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 are displayed in Fig. S5.† The main absorption peaks of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 and A-IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 are very close to each other, located at about 38945.7 eV. However, the pre-edge position of A-IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 is slightly right shifted compared to that of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6. Correspondingly, the EXAFS spectrum of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 shows a main peak at 1.97 Å, which is positively shifted to 2.02 Å for A-IrO2/LiLa2IrO6, demonstrating an obvious change before and after OER testing.
The OER performance of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 was evaluated in a typical three-electrode electrochemical system in 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte and the OER activity of commercially available IrO2 was also measured for comparison. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve in Fig. 3a shows that the overpotential to reach the benchmark 10 mA cm−2 is 300 mV for commercial IrO2, in accordance with most previous studies.51 Encouragingly, IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 exhibits enhanced OER activity evidenced by a low overpotential of 278 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−2. More importantly, the Tafel slope of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 is 45 mV dec−1, which is much lower than that of commercial IrO2 (67 mV dec−1), indicating that IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 has a faster reaction kinetics (Fig. 3b). Such enhanced OER activity may be attributed to the highly active IrOxin situ formed on the surface of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 during the electrochemical process. Fig. S6† shows the CV curves of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 and commercial IrO2 at various scan rates from 20–120 mV s−1 to determine the double layer capacitance, and the tested electrochemical window is in a non-faradaic potential window (from 1.05–1.15 V vs. RHE). As evidenced in Fig. 3c, the calculated Cdl value is 23 mF cm−2 for IrO2/LiLa2IrO6, smaller than that of IrO2 (31.5 mF cm−2). However, the OER current density of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 at a potential of 1.55 V vs. RHE is 0.046 mA cm−2, which is 2.42 times higher than that of commercial IrO2, convincingly proving high intrinsic activity of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6.12 The calculated value of the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is 54.2 cm2 for IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 and 74.2 cm2 for IrO2. The corresponding ECSA-normalized polarization curves of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 and commercial IrO2 are shown in Fig. S7.† Electrode conductivity and OER kinetics can be assessed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As shown in Fig. 3d, the smaller diameter of the semicircle demonstrates the smaller charge transfer resistance of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6, which suggests higher conductivity and favourable OER kinetics.

Electrochemical stability is a significantly important indicator of catalyst performance to evaluate whether the catalyst can be applied in practice. As illustrated in Fig. 3e, the durability of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 and IrO2 was investigated via the chronopotentiometric method at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2. Evidently, the potential of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 is still lower (1.67 V vs. RHE) after continuous testing for more than 13 h. In sharp contrast, commercial IrO2 almost lost its OER activity within 7 h. The enhanced electrochemical stability indicates that the introduction of the LiLa2IrO6 core can stabilize the highly active IrOx surface layer to a certain extent. Comparing the overpotential of IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 at 10 mA cm−2 with those of the recently reported electrocatalysts in acidic media, the IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 ranks among the most active electrocatalysts (Fig. 3f and Table S1†).
The effects of synthetic conditions including annealing temperature and the molar ratio of Li to La on the catalytic performance were also investigated. First, the optimum preparation temperature of the catalyst was explored by changing the annealing temperature from 1000 to 1400 °C. Obviously, the target catalyst prepared at 1200 °C has the highest activity (Fig. 4a). Moreover, the Tafel slope of the catalyst prepared at 1200 °C is lower than those of the catalysts prepared at 1000 and 1400 °C (Fig. 4b). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S8†) curves obtained with various scan rates from 20 mV s−1 to 120 mV s−1 were applied to determine the double layer capacitance (Cdl). As shown in Fig. 4c, the Cdl value of catalyst-1200 (catalyst-T, T = 1200 °C) is the largest (23 mF cm−2). As evidenced by the XRD patterns in Fig. S1 and S9,† the composition of catalyst-1000 °C is LiLa2IrO6, while the composition of catalyst-1200 is LiLa2IrO6 with a thin IrO2 shell (IrO2/LiLa2IrO6). Thus, we speculate that the in situ formed IrO2 shell may significantly contribute to the increased ECSA and thus, expose more active sites. Besides, the semicircle diameter in the EIS spectrum (Fig. S10†) for catalyst-1200 is the smallest among the three catalysts, indicating that it has the lowest resistance and the fastest OER kinetics. To explore the optimal ratio of Li to La, a series of experiments with various molar ratios of Li to La (from 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4, to 2:1) were conducted. As evidenced in Fig. 4d–f and S11,† the IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 catalyst prepared with the molar ratio of Li:La = 1:4 showed the best OER performance with the highest OER activity, the smallest Tafel slope and the largest ECSA determined by Cdl.

Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated a simple solid-phase synthesis method to in situ prepare a LiLa2IrO6 catalyst with a thin IrO2 shell, which exhibited a superior acidic OER performance with a low overpotential of 278 mV to attain 10 mA cm−2 current density as well as better stability. Specifically, the overpotential increased by less than 160 mV over continuous testing for 13 h at the benchmark of 10 mA cm−2, in contrast to commercially available IrO2 that almost lost OER activity within 7 h. The formed IrOx produced from surface reconstruction during the electrochemical process may contribute to the high activity toward the OER. Besides, highly active IrOx could be stabilized by LiLa2IrO6 to a certain extent by the electron interaction, which inhibited the over-oxidation and delayed the dissolution of IrOx, resulting in enhanced stability. We highly expected that this work can provide an effective strategy for designing stable and efficient electrocatalysts for catalyzing the OER in acidic media.
