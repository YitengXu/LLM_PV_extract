    , Accepted 11th July 2022First published on 12th July 2022AbstractThe current work describes the Michael addition (MA) reaction between amine group appended NDI derivatives and α,β-unsaturated ketones (chalcones) with an aim to tune the optical and electrochemical properties of NDI derivatives via an easy and scalable synthesis method. Two NDI derivatives having aromatic (1) and aliphatic (2) amine N-imide substituents were synthesized and further used for the synthesis of MA products. The products were evaluated for their optical, electrochemical and transport properties. Aggregation behavior of the molecules was studied and established by absorption and emission spectroscopy. It is observed that NDIs and their respective MA derivatives (3 and 4) show strong aggregation behavior. Most interestingly the HOMO–LUMO energy levels in MA products were uplifted which is generally not achieved by imide-N substitutions. The driving force for intramolecular electron transfer  was calculated from their first oxidation and reduction potentials indicating the formation of charge separated states. MA products also showed improved electron mobility compared to their NDI precursors. Intramolecular charge transfer interaction was established by fluorescence and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS). The materials have been studied for their use as electron transport layer (ETL) materials in inverted organic solar cells and an efficiency of 3% has been obtained. Overall, Michael addition reaction on NDI has resulted in effective tuning of optical properties, energy levels and transport properties without involving tedious multistep core substitution reactions.
1. Introduction
Research in the field of organic solar cells by the modulation of electronic and optical properties of rylene diimides is increasing very fast.1 Fullerene based acceptors suffer from limitations like weak light absorption, stability issues and limited tunability of their optical properties.2 Therefore, an urgent need has arisen for the synthesis of new rylene based n-type semiconductor materials due to their strong visible light absorption, high electron affinity and high electron mobility.3,4 Naphthalenediimide (NDI) and perylenediimide (PDI) are an important class of rylene based materials, which have attractive optical and electrical properties, possess electron deficient π surfaces, show the tendency of forming self-assembled structures and undergo at least two reversible electrochemical reductions.5–7 Naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTCDA) is used as a precursor for the synthesis of a variety of derivatives. Several types of reactions are reported for derivatization of NTCDA,8 such as imide substitution, which generally does not have a substantial effect on its optical and electronic properties.9 Attachment of substituents at the core position may uplift the HOMO energy level for favourable oxidation or can lower the LUMO energy level for favourable reduction.10 Incorporation of rigid groups onto the NDI framework enhances the solubility and stability of these molecules.11 The solubility of NDI derivatives in polar and non-polar solvents can be enhanced by introduction of bulky aliphatic substituents. However, bulky aryl substituents do not contribute enough for enhanced solubility due to aggregate formation.12 The comparative study of saturated and unsaturated side chains in NDI derivatives showed a significant influence on molecular aggregation and therefore optical and electrical properties.13 Our group has also studied the effect of different aromatic and aliphatic substituents at imide-N on the photophysical, electrochemical and electronic properties of NDI.14 The self-assembly properties of the N,N′-di(hexadecyl) naphthalenetetracarboxylicdiimide (HD-NDI) derivative, forming an effective channel for high electron mobility ∼1.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, are reported.15 By the choice of substituents at the core position, the photophysical and electronic properties of NDI derivatives have been tuned for a wide variety of applications. We have also recently published the effect of number of substituents at the core position on the optoelectronic properties.16 For application of these materials in organic electronics, energy level tuning is required which is generally not observed with imide-N substitutions.17 However, the introduction of electron donating groups like thiophene, alkyl, etc., at the core position uplifted the HOMO–LUMO levels of NDI.18 On the other hand, derivatization using electron withdrawing groups like cyano, chloro, bromo, perfluoroalkyl, etc., at the conjugated core resulted in lower LUMO levels and higher stability.19 As the core substitution reactions are usually multistep reactions, require costly catalysts and also suffer from low yield,20 there is the need of an easy synthesis process delivering NDI derivatives with tuning of energy levels. Various coupling reactions like Suzuki, Stille, Sonogashira, etc., have been reported for the tuning of optical and electrochemical properties of naphthalenediimides.21–24 To enhance their properties further derivatization can be performed with the complementary functional groups present on NDI molecules.25–27 Kurdi et al., reported an asymmetric hydroxyl functionalised naphthalenediimide which was further esterified with exo-5-norbornene carboxylic acid to give a regiorandom polymer with enhanced power conversion efficiency compared to the other small NDI molecules.28 As imide substitutions are the easiest, fastest and commercially viable reactions, a derivatization method on the imide substituent needs to be introduced delivering tuned energy levels and improved optical and transport properties. The electron transport layer (ETL) plays an effective role in the enhancement of device performance; the J–V characteristics of photovoltaic devices exhibit an S-shaped curve in the absence of ETL due to poor electron transport and a Schottky barrier is formed which doesn’t allow extraction of electrons from the semiconductor to the electrode.29 Generally NDI based derivatives are used as acceptor materials with the donors as a blend in the photoactive layer or as an ETL in perovskite solar cells. NDI derivatives possess good electron mobility and suitable HOMO and LUMO levels which makes them promising materials to be used as an ETL for organic solar cell devices. Inverted device structures in which the ETL is present on the side of incident light require an ETL of around 5–10 nm in thickness as increased thickness may create parasitic absorption in the visible region. Here these conjugated systems have resulted in improved electron mobility and lower series resistance, and the well matched LUMO and HOMO levels of the ETL materials to the conduction and valence band of the active layer prevent the loss of Voc and enhance electron extraction. The presence of nitrogen and sulphur rich species on the ETL material helps in passivating the defects and hence improves the device performance.30 An amine substituted coronenediimide (CDIN) has been used as the ETL in perovskite solar cells; its low temperature processability, solubility in alcohols and the π conjugated planar structure allow efficient face-on π–π stacking and hence higher performance, and an efficiency of up to 10% with CDIN as the ETL and 11% with ZnO/CDIN as the ETL has been obtained.31 The charge transport behavior of the devices has been studied with CDIN as the ETL with an electron mobility of 6.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 measured by the SCLC technique as coronenediimides facilitated efficient exciton dissociation. Substitution with various lipophilic, hydrophilic, alkoxy and aliphatic chains with a thiol terminal at the imide position of NDI leads to an increase in solubility which is an important criterion for formation of pristine and homogeneous blend films.32 In the present study, we are introducing Michael addition reactions for NDI derivatization. Here, the α–β unsaturated carbonyl group present in chalcone functions as a Michael acceptor while the free terminal amine group of the NDI derivative acts as a Michael donor to form Michael addition (MA) products in the presence of a base catalyst. The products thus synthesized show special photophysical properties and tuning of energy levels without disturbing the naphthalene core. The structures of NDI precursor molecules 1 (PPD-NDI) and 2 (EDA-NDI) and their respective MA products 3 (MA-PPD-NDI) and 4 (MA-EDA-NDI) are shown in Fig. 1, where 3 bears an aromatic linker while 4 has an aliphatic linker between the NDI core and the terminal moiety. The structures of the synthesized products have been established via different spectroscopic techniques. Photophysical properties have been studied by steady state absorption, emission and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Finally, the electron mobility of the products is estimated by fabricating electron-only devices. These imide substituted NDI derivatives have been further tested as ETL materials in inverted OSCs as it avoids the need of the hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer which is needed in conventional OSCs. The synthesized derivatives show solubility in orthogonal solvent methanol and suitable HOMO–LUMO level alignment with the active layers to be used as ETLs in OSCs. An average PCE of up to 3% has been obtained in devices where Michael addition products are used as the ETL.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials and characterization techniques
1,4,5,8-Naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTCDA) and amines, i.e., p-phenylene diamine and ethylene diamine, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Merck) and were used as received. The reactions were carried out in an anhydrous solvent in oven-dried glassware in an inert environment of nitrogen. Thin-layer chromatography was used to monitor the progress of the reaction and the products were purified by column chromatography. To confirm the structure of the products, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed on a PerkinElmer FTIR Spectrum 2. The sample was ground with anhydrous KBr, and pellets were prepared to record the spectrum from 4000 to 400 cm−1. Before scanning the sample, the background spectrum in air was collected. The products were also characterized by 1H NMR on a Jeol 400 MHz spectrometer in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. A Shimadzu UV-Vis 2600 spectrophotometer was used to record the UV-vis absorption spectra of compounds in the given solution. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out for these compounds in different solvents using a Varian (CARY eclipse) fluorescence spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed in dichloromethane solution of NDI materials with a 3-electrode system using Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, a Pt disc as the working electrode, platinum wire as the counter electrode and 0.1 M TBAPF6 (tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate) as the supporting electrolyte. The potential was calibrated using ferrocene as an internal standard. All measurements were performed under an inert atmosphere and the solution was degassed for ∼15 min before each run. Current (I) vs. voltage (V) was measured using an Autolab electrochemical workstation at 100 mV−1 s−1 scan rate. Ultrafast optical pump–probe transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) was performed in solution form (DCM). A train of optical pulses from a Ti:Sapphire laser amplifier (35 fs, 4 mJ per pulse, 1 kHz, 800 nm) gets split into two beams with a beam splitter. The high intensity beam works as a pump and an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS, Light Conversion) was employed to vary the wavelength of this pump beam from 190 nm to 2600 nm. The other beam with weak intensity was propagated through a CaF2 crystal to generate a white light continuum (WLC) covering the whole spectrum of visible light to be used as a probe beam. Here we have performed ultrafast pump–probe spectroscopy using a 300 and 350 nm pump beam at normal incidence and the changes in absorption were detected by using a gated CMOS detector.
2.2 Electron only device fabrication
The charge carrier mobility of all the materials was investigated by fabricating electron only devices using SCLC measurements. The ITO coated glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with soap solution, acetone and isopropyl alcohol sequentially and dried in a vacuum oven. The zinc oxide (ZnO) precursor solution was spin coated on cleaned ITO substrates and then heated on a hot plate at 250 °C for 30 minutes. The active layer solution of both the NDIs and the MA products (35 mg mL−1) in methanol was spin-coated on top of ZnO coated ITO substrates with annealing at 80 °C for 10 minutes. Finally, the substrates were loaded into a thermal evaporator for the deposition of the metal electrode (Al) of ∼150 nm thickness under high vacuum. I–V characteristics were recorded at room temperature under dark conditions using a computer controlled Keithley 2420 source measurement unit.
2.3 Fabrication of inverted organic solar cell devices
Inverted organic solar cells with geometry ITO/ETL/PTB7:PC71BM/MoOx/Ag were fabricated under ambient conditions. ITO coated substrates were cleaned using a detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol and finally dried in a vacuum oven. NDI derivatives (3 mg mL−1, 5 mg mL−1 and 7 mg mL−1) were spin coated at 1000 rpm over cleaned ITO substrates followed by annealing at 100 °C for 15 min. The active layer solution of PTB7:PC71BM (1:1.5, 25 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) was spin coated onto them at 1500 rpm followed by annealing for 8 min at 70 °C. After that a hole transport layer of MoOx (∼8 nm) and a ∼100 nm Ag layer as the anode were thermally deposited under vacuum. The I–V characteristics of fabricated devices were measured under standard testing conditions (AM 1.5 G, 1000 W m−2, 25 °C) using a calibrated Keithley 2420 source meter and a Photoemission Tech. (PET) CT100AAA solar simulator.

3. Results and discussion
In the present work, we have synthesized two Michael addition products from two different NDI precursors (1 and 2) (Fig. 1). Products 1 and 2 possess aromatic and aliphatic amine end groups respectively providing aromatic and aliphatic linkers in their respective MA products. Chalcone, the α–β unsaturated ketone, has been synthesized via Claisen–Schimdt condensation of acetophenone with aldehydes (Fig. S1(a), ESI†). This reaction leads to the formation of enone where an α–β double bond is present next to phenyl ketone.36 The synthesis of Michael addition products 3 and 4 is shown in Fig. S1(b) (ESI†). To the best of our knowledge, Michael addition reactions are not known in NDI derivatization and have been introduced in the current work. Michael addition reactions are the reactions in which the olefinic bond of chalcone is attacked by the anion and the reaction is carried out under strong basic/acidic conditions in the presence of a suitable solvent.37 Chalcone synthesized in this work acts as a Michael acceptor and NDI with a terminal free NH2 group acts as a Michael donor. Reactions have been carried out in the presence of base catalyst triethylamine (NEt3) or sodium ethoxide (NaOEt). A low product yield of ∼10% was obtained with NEt3 however; NaOEt on the other hand gave better yield. Therefore, reactions were carried out in the presence of NaOEt as a catalyst at 90 °C for 72 hours.
3.1 Structural characterization
The structure of the products was confirmed by spectroscopy techniques. The FTIR spectra of products 1, 2, 3 and 4 are shown in Fig. S2(a) (ESI†). Carbonyl peaks at 1778 and 1761 cm−1 in NTCDA are shifted to 1713 and 1665 cm−1 in 1 and 1668 and 1659 cm−1 in 2 respectively confirming the imide formation. N–H stretching was observed at 3412 and 3365 cm−1 in 1 and at 3445 and 3368 cm−1 in 2 for the free primary amine N–H bond stretching. The FTIR spectra of chalcone A are shown in Fig. S2(b) (ESI†). In acetophenone, the CO stretching peak was observed at 1676 cm−1 which is shifted to 1656 cm−1 in chalcone. The CC bond stretching observed at 1596 cm−1 and the aliphatic C–N stretching at 1226 cm−1 confirm the structure of chalcone.
In the FTIR spectra of Michael addition products 3 and 4 shown in Fig. S2(a) (ESI†), an additional stretching peak at ∼1726 cm−1 and 1707 cm−1 (in 3 and 4 respectively) is observed for the carbonyl group attached to the terminal phenyl ring. The stretching peaks at 3486 and 3466 cm−1 in 3 and 4 respectively confirm the presence of the secondary N–H group in MA products. The characteristic stretching frequency of one carbonyl group is increased due to loss of conjugation and also broadening in the peaks was observed in the Michael addition products. 1H NMR spectra shown in Fig. S4 to S8 (ESI†) confirm the structure of chalcone A, NDI (1 and 2) and Michael addition products (3 and 4). Mass spectral analysis of products 1, 2, 3 and 4 also supports the formation of the products (Fig. S9).
3.2 Steady state absorption and emission spectroscopy study
To study the optical and aggregation properties of NDI (1 and 2) and MA products (3 and 4), steady state absorption and emission experiments were performed in solution. The qualitative absorption spectra of NDI and MA products in dilute tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution (1 μM) are shown in Fig. 2(a). NDI 1 shows absorption bands at 376, 353 and 336 nm for (0–0), (0–1) and (0–2) electronic transitions with extended absorption in the region from 400 to 650 nm indicating high aggregation behaviour due to the presence of the aromatic amine end group. The molecule 2 shows the characteristic absorption bands of monomeric NDI molecules at 378, 358 and 340 nm.38,39 NDI molecules exist in a self-assembled form due to the effective π–π interaction which is a result of H-bonding and intermolecular charge transfer interactions.40 The absorption spectrum of chalcone A is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) where bands at 338 and 413 nm are observed. Michael addition products mostly show broad extended absorption as shown in Fig. 2(a). Extended absorption indicates the high tendency of bulky-end group bearing MA products to form aggregation even in dilute solution due to the presence of strong inter/intramolecular charge transfer interactions.
 Fig. 2  Normalized UV-vis absorption (a) and emission spectra (b) of 1, 2, 3 and 4 (1 μM) in THF solution. 
The aggregation behaviour in NDI derivatives is probed by the shift in absorption bands on increase in concentration. Molecules aligned parallel to each other with hypsochromic shift exist in the form of H-type aggregates while head to tail arrangement along with bathochromic shift indicates J-type aggregation.41,42 The comparative absorption spectra of the products in dilute (1 μM) and concentrated solutions (1 mM) are shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). Products 1 and 3 showed improved absorption on increasing the concentration. New bands appeared in 1 at 413, 526 and 569 nm due to the strong inter/intramolecular CT interactions among the free aromatic amine end groups. A slight red shift in the absorption bands of both the products was observed in concentrated solution. Products 2 and 4 with an aliphatic amine end group and an aliphatic linker respectively showed quenched absorption on increasing the concentration. The clear transition bands of 2 are also lost with extended absorption up to 500 nm. However, no shift in band position was noticed for both the products. To further explore the aggregation behaviour, we investigated the absorption spectra of these products in fresh and 48 hour aged samples using concentrated (1 mM) solutions in different solvents (polar and nonpolar) as solvents play an important role in determining the morphological assembly of molecules. We have previously reported the aggregation behaviour of NDI substituted with aliphatic and aromatic groups in different polarity solvents in their fresh and aged samples showing less tendency of aggregate formation.13 1 mM solutions were prepared in toluene, DCM, CHCl3, THF, 1,4-dioxane and DMF. Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectra of the products in different solvents under fresh and aged conditions.
 Fig. 3  UV-Vis absorption spectra of products 1, 2, 3, and 4 in different solvents under fresh and 48 h aged conditions. 
NDI and MA products show broad absorption bands in fresh as well as in aged samples in all the solvents. The absorption spectra of fresh and 48 h aged solutions of 1, 2, 3 and 4 in different solvents are shown in Fig. S11 to S14 (ESI†). Slight red shifts were observed in absorption bands on aging (Table S1, ESI†) indicating the J-type aggregation behavior of the products. For fresh samples of 2 (1 mM) in different solvents a monomeric nature was observed and the peak for 0–2 transition disappeared. Extended absorption at 404 nm is observed in DCM, CHCl3, toluene and dioxane while in THF and DMF it is not observed. In 48 h aged samples, red shift is observed in polar solvents DCM, CHCl3, DMF and dioxane, indicating J-type aggregation. Aromatic solvents like toluene interact with the naphthalene core and therefore disrupt the intermolecular interaction of NDI molecules. However, in the case of polar solvents, the π–π interaction of the NDI core gets enhanced resulting in increased interaction as observed here and causing broadening and red shift.43,44 At higher concentrations there are vibrational transitions between the vibronic levels present in the electronic excited states causing broadening of bands. Similar to NDI, MA products also show slight red shift in polar solvents DCM, CHCl3 and THF, while the aged samples did not show any significant shift as also observed in our previous studies, and only the broadening in bands was observed.
The A0–1/A0–0 ratio explains the tendency of NDI molecules to undergo aggregation in different polarity solvents. Higher the ratio, higher is the extent of aggregation of NDI molecules in that solvent.12 The absorbance ratio of fresh and aged samples of product 2 in six solvents and product 1 in three solvents is calculated and the data are summarized in Table 1. Product 1 in toluene, chloroform and DCM and MA products 3 and 4 in all the six solvents do not show defined (0–0) and (0–1) transition absorption bands and therefore the ratio could not be calculated. However, this shows their high aggregate forming tendency. The A0–1/A0–0 ratio is increased for 1 and 2 on aging. In product 2 the ratio still remains near 1 and 2 shows lower aggregation behavior among all the products.

Photoluminescence study of the molecules was carried out as fluorescence is sensitive to aggregation. The qualitative emission spectra of products 1, 2, 3 and 4 in THF are shown in Fig. 2(b). The excitation wavelength used for NDIs was 350 nm and for MA products it was 300 nm. The emission spectra of all the products show broad emission between 350 and 650 nm for the excimer emission due to aggregate formation.45–47 Restriction in the rotation of intramolecular bonds, J-type aggregation, hydrophilic interactions and excimer formation are some of the factors which are responsible for aggregation induced emission in the molecules.48,49 NDI molecules show low Stokes shift while MA products show high Stokes shift with structure less emission in dilute solutions.
To further explain the aggregation behaviour, photoluminescence study was performed in different solvents using 1 mM solution (Fig. 4). Strong excimer emission is observed in all the solvents; however, the overall emission intensity was lower in MA products than in NDI precursors. The effective inter/intramolecular charge transfer between terminal groups and the naphthalene core in MA products causes the emission quenching. To further probe into the type of CT present in molecules, we recorded the emission spectra in chloroform solution with the addition of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). If aggregation is observed in the NDI derivatives due to presence of intermolecular CT interactions, then the monomeric nature of these NDI derivatives can be obtained on addition of triflouroacetic acid which is generally used to break the aggregation. For all the products, the emission intensity increases with the addition of TFA (Fig. S15, ESI†) but still the monomeric behaviour is not observed, which suggests that a very strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction is present in all the molecules. A transient absorption spectroscopy study was performed to further confirm the ICT interactions in products.

3.3 Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) study
From the absorption and emission study, it has been found that the aromatic amine end group linker plays an important role in aggregate formation in products 1 and 3. Both the MA products show CT interaction due to the presence of terminal branched groups as a singlet energy donor and a singlet energy acceptor NDI core. For effective intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) the femtosecond ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) study was performed using 300 and 350 nm pump wavelength and probed in the visible region. TAS is one of the important spectroscopic tools to study the generation of ultrafast transient species and their kinetics. The effect of type of linker on ultrafast dynamics in MA products, where an aliphatic linker provides flexibility while an aromatic linker gives a rigid but conjugated path, will be interesting to study. The effect of two types of end groups as well as the aliphatic vs. aromatic linker effect has been explored by TAS. Fig. 5A and B show the TA spectra of 1 and 2 where both the NDI show early appearance of transient species. In 1, TA appears after 885 fs of excitation between 500 and 700 nm with maxima at ∼638 nm for the singlet excited state formation. On the other hand, 2 shows the appearance of TA after 1.36 ps of excitation with clear maxima at ∼515 nm. In 1 there is the appearance of a transient band after 1 ps of delay time at ∼730 nm with long lived species of ∼186 ps for the charge transfer state formation. In 2, no such band appears, clearly indicating that the aromatic amine end group provides an efficient path for the charge transfer interactions. The lifetime of the different transitions is summarized in Table 2.

Fig. 5C and D show the TA spectra of MA products. Similar to precursor NDI (1), MA products also show strong TA in the 500–700 nm region for singlet state absorption. Both the MA products show new strong and long lived transient absorption in the 700–800 nm region compared to their NDI precursors. Product 3 in comparison to 4 gives very strong TA at ∼725 nm. The corresponding GSB is also seen in 4. These transitions are attributed to charge transfer state formation due to ICT as also discussed in previous sections. All other features are similar to those of NDI precursors. As depicted in Fig. 5, clear CT state formation is evident in the TA spectra of MA products. The lifetime of the CT state is longer in product 3 in comparison to product 4. This indicates that the aromatic linker facilitates stabilization of the transient state.
3.4 Electrochemical analysis and electron transfer driving force
Electrochemical studies were performed for the determination of the HOMO–LUMO energy levels of the redox active species by application of forward and reverse potential scans. Anodic waves for oxidations appear in the positive forward scan and the corresponding cathodic waves appear in the reverse scan. Fig. S16 (ESI†) shows the cyclic voltammograms of the products and the data are summarized in Table 3. Two reversible reductions are observed in 1 and 2 which are well known for N-substituted NDI derivatives. With the increase in the electron donating character due to derivatization on the imide nitrogen, an oxidation peak is also observed in MA products. Product 3 shows one quasi reversible reduction and two quasi reversible oxidation potentials. In case of aliphatic amine substituted Michael addition product 4, two reversible oxidation and one reversible reduction was observed. The LUMO energy level of n-type NDI derivatives and MA products was estimated from the onset of reduction potential using the empirical formula ELUMO = −(Eonset(red) + 4.8 eV), where 4.8 eV is the accepted HOMO energy level of ferrocene.50 In NDI derivatives, due to the presence of localised LUMOs on the NDI units, an ELUMO of −3.9 eV is generally observed and is very challenging to tune. Takimiya et al. showed upliftment of HOMO–LUMO levels by attachment of two electron rich thiophene units at the core resulting in lowering of the band gap by uplifting of the HOMO and a slight shift in the LUMO.51,52 Also the tuning of HOMO–LUMO in a conjugated NDI dimer has been shown by introduction of electron withdrawing (4-trifluoromethyl) phenyl at the core downshifting the HOMO–LUMO and electron donating 4-diphenyl amino uplifting them.53 The reduction potential undergoes cathodic shift from the NDI precursors to their Michael addition products, which indicates that higher potential is required for reduction of MA products due to the electron donating nature of the substituents. This observation is in accordance with the photophysical study where also we observed strong ICT interaction. Fig. 6 shows the energy level diagram of the products; we can clearly see the uplifting of both HOMO and LUMO energy levels in MA products 3 and 4.

Using these electrochemical data, the driving force for intramolecular electron transfer  was calculated for MA products (Table 3).54 The driving force for intramolecular charge recombination processes from the NDI core radical anion to the terminal moiety can be calculated by the Weller equation:55 (1) is the first oxidation potential of the donor molecule, whereas  is the first reduction potential of the acceptor molecule. The driving force for the intramolecular charge separation process is obtained by eqn (2): (2)
Here, ΔE0–0 is the energy of the 0–0 transition, i.e., the energy gap between the lowest singlet excited state and the ground state. MA products show lower driving force for charge separation and higher driving force for charge recombination resulting in the formation of a more efficient charge separated state by ICT. The Gibb's free energy for charge separation is significantly lower in 3 compared to 4. This result corroborates well with the absorption/emission analysis showing efficient ICT in product 3 due to the presence of the aromatic linker.
3.5 Electron mobility measurements
Electron only devices of the structure ITO/ZnO/product/Al were fabricated and the mobility measurements of the devices were performed by the space charge limited current (SCLC) technique. Several transient techniques can be adopted for the mobility measurement like ToF (time of flight), dark injection transient current (DITC) and charge injection by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV), but these techniques are not very versatile – ToF requires nonconductive and thinner films (thinner than 1 μm).56 DITC experiences capacitive effects for thin films and charge trapping with thick films and CELIV requires conductive films. The SCLC technique is adopted for mobility measurements due to reproducible results, steady state and the requirement of modest equipment.57
To calculate the electron mobility of the materials by SCLC method, there should be two electrodes of which one should efficiently inject the required charge carriers and other should be capable of blocking charge carriers of opposite polarity. For uniform charge carrier mobility, the steady state current JSCLC is a function of applied voltage V, film thickness L, permittivity of the film ε, and steady state charge carrier mobility μSCLC is obtained with the help of the Mott–Gurney equation in which quadratic dependency of current on voltage at room temperature was observed:58 (3)
Electron mobility in the MA products has been increased by one order of magnitude by substitution with electron rich groups which results in enhanced transport properties of the molecules. The dark J–V data are presented as log(JSCLC) versus log(V) curves for 35 mg mL−1 solution in methanol in Fig. S17 (ESI†). Products 1 and 2 show an electron mobility of ∼1.1 × 10−5 and 2.12 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively. On substitution, the mobility increased by one order of magnitude in the Michael addition products. Product 3 undergoes four times increase in mobility and shows a mobility of ∼4.64 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and product 4 also undergoes enhancement in mobility by one order of magnitude in comparison to 2 (2.07 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). The aromatic end group/linker provides easy ICT and formation of long lived charge separated states; thus, more efficient transport of electrons results in better mobility in products 1 and 3. Mobility data are in good agreement with the Gibb's free energy calculated for charge separated state for 3, and also higher lifetime of CT states of 3 is observed in TAS. Further, the trap density is also calculated from logJ–V characteristics of the electron only devices and the values are summarized in Table 4.59 The traps in an organic semiconductor can originate due to disorders, contamination and degradation, and as a portion of charge carriers get trapped in these trap states, the effective electron mobility is lowered.60 The trap density can be calculated using the following equation: (4)where VTFL is the trap filled limited voltage and at this voltage the trap states are filled with charge carriers. Here, Nt is the trap density, q stands for electronic charge, L is the thickness, ∈ is the dielectric constant of the material and ∈0 is the permittivity of free space. From logJ–V curves, VTFL for products 3 and 4 is lowered due to the increased extent of charge transport. Using VTFL, the trap density was calculated and lower trap density in the aromatic NDI derivative supports its higher mobility. Also, the trap density is lower in products 3 and 4 than in the NDI precursors due to better delocalization of charge carriers and can effectively suppress charge trapped recombination at the interface as also observed through transient absorption spectroscopy and driving force studies.61

3.6 Device fabrication with NDI and MA products as the ETL
A highly crystalline nature and good film forming capabilities are the required characteristics for application of organic materials as electron transport layer (ETL) materials in OSCs. The feasibility of NDI materials for device fabrication is achieved through their solubility in methanol. In this work similar behavior is observed for NDI derivatives; their solubility in methanol and π–π stacking allow the use of these materials as ETL materials and inverted organic solar cell devices were fabricated with geometry ITO/NDI derivatives/PTB7:PC71BM/MoOx/Ag.62 The presence of nitrogen in these derivatives also affects their device performance as also reported by Kim et al., on incorporating nitrogen atoms into the backbone of dithiophene benzothiadiazole NDI derivatives, the electron mobility and device performance improved due to appropriately aligned energy levels and enhanced miscibility of this NDI derivative which works as acceptor with the PBDB-T donor.63 The champion cell for products 1, 2, 3 and 4 with their photovoltaic parameters is shown in Fig. S18 (ESI†) and the device data for the photovoltaic parameters ideality factor, series resistance and shunt resistance are summarized in Table 5. The device performance of inverted device without the presence of ETL layer has also been included (Table 5 and Fig. S20, ESI†). Here the aromatic amine NDI Michael addition derivative 3 shows higher performance than its precursor NDI, while in the aliphatic amine Michael addition derivative 4, the photovoltaic characteristics are nearly the same. Solutions of different concentrations were prepared (3 mg mL−1, 5 mg mL−1 and 7 mg mL−1) in methanol and tested as the ETL for optimization (Table S2–S5, ESI†). It can be observed that with the increase in concentration the thickness increases and a concentration of 3 mg mL−1 spin coated at 1000 rpm s−1 showed a film thickness of ∼8–10 nm and the best device performance for the materials. So, the device performance deteriorates with the increase in thickness. The parameters to study device performance like series resistance (RS), shunt resistance (Rsh) and ideality factor have been evaluated by theoretical fitting using the Breitenstein–Ribland model via the nanohub module and the values with J–V curves are shown in Fig. S19 (ESI†).64 In the case of NDI derivatives the device performance is improved due to better ohmic contact and small potential barrier at the interface between ITO and photoactive layers. Here, the non-ideality of the J–V characteristics is observed due to the presence of deeply trapped charge carriers rather than the trap induced recombination.65 A low value of series resistance Rs eliminates the potential induced due to loss of charge neutrality at high bias voltage and hence improves the fill factor. In the case of 3, a fill factor of 54% is observed due to its high shunt resistance and low series resistance which makes it a better performer in comparison to other products which have high series resistance and low shunt resistance. Although the performance is not as good as with the standard ZnO devices which show very high shunt resistance, the performance can be further optimized for better device efficiency.66

3.7 Self-assembly study
Photophysical study of the molecules shows π–π interactions and formation of excimers, so to study the stacking arrangement in the films SEM analysis is required. We performed scanning electron microscopy analysis of films cast over a glass substrate with 0.5 mM solutions in methanol followed by annealing at 50 °C. In the case of 1 flake like structures are observed, while with 2, needle like structures are observed.67 In 3 and 4, irregular globular shaped and flower like self-assembly was observed respectively as shown in Fig. 7. The inset of the figure represents the images at higher magnification. Products 3 and 4 show a higher extent of agglomeration due to the presence of bulky substituents at the terminal position. A flower like morphological arrangement was observed between a NDI bola amphiphile and melamine as observed in Michael addition product 4 due to the presence of H-bonding and π–π interactions.68 Naphthalenediimide (NDI) based amphiphilic molecules possessing a benzyl ester group at both terminals showed spherical nanoparticles and self-assembly through J-aggregation.69 This shows that molecules exist in a highly aggregated form in solution undergoing J-aggregation as observed from absorption and emission spectroscopy.
 Fig. 7  SEM images of (A) 1, (B) 2, (C) 3, and (D) 4. 
Overall, in the current study we analyzed the optical, electrochemical and transport properties of NDI 1 and 2 and their corresponding MA products 3 and 4. All the products show aggregation behavior in their concentrated solutions and J-type aggregation is observed. The aromatic end group linker in 1 and 3 shows a high tendency of aggregate formation as structure less absorption was observed in dilute as well as in their concentrated solutions. However, the aggregation pattern facilitates easy transport of electrons and formation of stable charge separated states. Michael addition products, in addition, show effective uplifting of HOMO–LUMO energy levels which is not easy to achieve by mere imide N-functionalization. The synthesized NDI derivatives in this work result in an efficiency of almost 3% with these ETL materials, also improvement in the fill factor is observed as the MA derivatives possess lower trap density than their NDI precursors.
Conclusions
N-imide substitution for the synthesis of NDI generally does not contribute towards tuning the electrochemical and charge transport properties substantially. Here, we have shown the effect of side chain substitution on the electron mobility of MA products. Tuning of the electrochemical properties has been observed with upliftment in HOMO and LUMO levels, resulting in lowering of the band gap. Due to the supramolecular arrangement of molecules, aggregation is observed. Molecules show more extent of aggregation in toluene. MA products undergo J-type arrangement in different polar and non-polar solvents. Self-assembly study of the molecules also confirms that these molecules exist in an aggregated form. From the calculated driving force for intramolecular electron transfer, lower driving force for charge separation in the Michael addition products supports the presence of intermolecular CT interactions. Charge transfer interaction has been clearly observed by TAS study which is important for efficient charge transport in organic solar cells. The products worked effectively as the ETL in organic solar cell devices and the aromatic linker provides better charge transport and better efficiency. The synthesized products with tuned optical and electrochemical properties find various applications in the field of optoelectronics.
