    , Accepted 23rd January 2018First published on 23rd January 2018AbstractWe present a theoretical modeling of the point defect screening by the CH3NH3+ dipoles in CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) perovskites. The organic sublattice of these materials is believed to be related to the exceptional performance of the perovskite solar cells. Our work is based on a statistical model with the short-range and dipolar interactions between the CH3NH3+ cations. We extend the model to account for the long-range charge–dipole interactions between the defects and organic cations. The model is studied by the Monte Carlo simulations on a three-dimensional lattice. We investigate the charge screening in different structural phases of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite for various values of the charge–dipole interaction energy. We demonstrate that a substantial interaction disturbs the antipolar long-range order of the CH3NH3+ cations giving rise to a multidomain phase with a small electric polarization. We also discuss the screening of two neighboring charges which might be important in a context of the photogenerated electron–hole pair separation.
1 Introduction
In the past decade, the perovskite methylammonium lead halides CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) have been extensively investigated as materials for effective and affordable solar cell devices.1,2 The power conversion efficiency of cells containing these hybrid compounds is already above 20%.3 The high performance of these materials arises from the combined interplay of several physical factors such as large absorption coefficient,4 suitable bandgap,5 long carrier diffusion length,6–8 low exciton binding energy9 and exceptional defect tolerance.10–14
Some of these factors are related to the relatively high polarizability (dielectric constant) of the organic methylammonium CH3NH3+ (MA+) sublattice.11,15 Several studies proposed that the mechanism behind the defect tolerance is screening of the charged defects by the MA+ cations.15–17 This effect should reduce the carrier capture cross section leading to the high carrier diffusion lengths and reduced electron–hole recombination rates.
The defects and their formation energies in MAPbX3 perovskites were substantially investigated using density functional theory (DFT)18–21 and other22 theoretical methods. Most of the studies revealed that the majority of defects with the low formation energy form shallow states within the bandgap.12,13 However, under certain crystal growth conditions, some of the defects form deep states that may significantly contribute to the electron–hole recombination.10,23–25 Various experimental techniques also revealed both shallow and deep defect traps in MAPbX3 perovskites and solar cells.26–31
The relatively unhindered motion of the organic cations32–34 may also contribute to the screening-related separation of the photogenerated charge carriers resulting in the experimentally observed low exciton binding energy.9,35 Gong et al. observed a decrease of the carrier lifetime upon deuteration of the MA+ cations revealing a tight relation between the cation inertia and carrier transport.36 Several recent studies also point to a combined phonon and methylammonium screening effect resulting in large polaron11,37,38 or hyperpolaron15 assisted charge transfer. Contrary to this notion, recent theoretical investigations25,39 stimulate further attention to this topic by suggesting that the organic sublattice does not contribute to the charge separation.
In this study we investigate the charge screening by the MA+ dipoles in MAPbI3 perovskite using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. To our knowledge, there are no similar computational studies of screening effects in these systems. We chose the MC approach, since the screening phenomenon involves ensembles of many interacting particles that can be rather easily simulated at various temperatures using this method. Our study is based on the phase transition model which was previously used by us to successfully describe the antipolar order in this material.40 The original model is slightly extended to incorporate the charged defect sites that interact with the surrounding MA+ cations. We deduce the interaction parameters required for a substantial screening and investigate the temperature and phase transition effects on the dipole arrangement around the defect sites. We also show how the charged defects can disturb the antipolar long-range order of the MA+ cations resulting in the multidomain phase with a nonzero electric polarization.
2 Model and simulation details
This study is based on the extended statistical model proposed and employed by us to describe the MA+ cation ordering and phase transition sequence in MAPbX3 perovskites.40 The original model consists of six vector states that correspond to different orientations of the MA+ cations (see Fig. 1a). Each state is directed to a face of a cube which represents the inorganic lead-halide framework. The cation states interact via the two strain-induced short-range interactions depicted in Fig. 1b. These interactions occur only between the perpendicular states lying in the ab-plane. The corresponding interaction energies are denoted as e1 and e2. In our previous study, we used e1 = −43 and e2 = −13 meV.40

(b) Two main short-range interactions e1 and e2 between the cation states in the ab-plane. (c) A cross section of the three-dimensional lattice of our model demonstrating a cutoff radius rc used to evaluate the dipole–dipole and charge–dipole long-range interactions. 
In addition to the short-range interactions, the long-range dipole–dipole interactions between the MA+ cations play an important role in the ordering.40 The dipole–dipole Hamiltonian is expressed as (1)where i is a unit vector of the electric dipole moment at the lattice site i. The dipole vector of each state is i = p0i, where p0 is 2.29 D.5 A vector ij joins two dipole moments i and j situated at the lattice sites i and j. rij and ij denote the absolute value and the unit vector of ij, respectively. The distance rij is expressed in units of the cubic lattice constant a. The sum is evaluated using a cutoff radius rc which is up to 10 in our calculations (see Fig. 1c). The strength of the dipolar interaction is characterized by the energy parameter edd which was estimated in our previous study to be about 8.6 meV.40
The dipolar and two short-range interactions are sufficient to successfully reproduce the whole phase transition sequence and transition temperatures in MAPbI3.40 We found that during the cubic-tetragonal phase transition, the MA+ cations partially order into two sublattices in the ab-planes, while the complete long-range order is established in the orthorhombic phase. In this phase, the cations are also ordered along the c-axis forming stripes of the antiferroelectric (antipolar) arrangement. Thus, the total electric polarization in all phases is zero supporting recent evidence of the non-ferroelectric nature of MAPbX3 perovskites.15,41,42
To describe the defect screening, we slightly modified our original model. First, we extended the number of cation states from 6 to 26. The new states are depicted in Fig. 1a and correspond to the MA+ cations pointing to the corners and edges of a lead-halide cube. Such extension is necessary, since the original six states are not sufficient to properly mimic the screening of charged defects on a large distance scale. The additional states interact only via the dipolar interactions. We note that a 26-state model was also used by Leguy et al.43 to investigate the ordering of the MA+ cations.
The introduction of additional states in our model does not change the cation arrangement in the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases. However, this model modification lowers the temperature of the cubic–tetragonal phase transition to Tc1 = 225 K. To compensate this effect, we increased the value of the e2 parameter from the previously used −13 to −21 meV. This results in the phase transition temperature of about 290 K which is much closer to the experimental value.44 The temperature of the tetragonal–orthorhombic phase transition is almost unaffected by the model extension and its value is Tc2 = 140 K.
The defect sites in our model are the stationary point charges. Mostly we study negative charge defects which represent the vacancies of the MA+ cations. The defects interact with all states of the neighboring MA+ dipoles. The Hamiltonian of such long-range charge–dipole interaction for a single defect at site j is (2)Here rij denotes the distance between the defect and MA+ cation situated at site i. ij is the corresponding unit vector. Note a substantially weaker decay of this interaction with distance compared with the dipole–dipole interaction. The sum is calculated using the cutoff radius rc around a defect (see Fig. 1c). For several defects in the system, the Hamiltonian is evaluated by summing over all defect sites.
The strength of the charge–dipole interaction is characterized by the parameter ecd which can be expressed as: (3)where Q is a defect charge with a magnitude equal to the elementary charge. ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and ε denotes the dielectric constant of the inorganic framework. Using this equation, we estimated that ecd should not exceed 90 meV which roughly corresponds to 2|e1|. Note that here the magnitude of ecd was obtained using a simple electrostatic picture which does not take into account lattice strain effects that may occur around a defect site. The lattice deformations could significantly alter the e1/ecd ratio in the vicinity of a defect. Hence, in our calculations we decided to keep the ecd parameter as a variable.
The final Hamiltonian of our system is (4)where the first term denotes the short-range strain-induced interactions characterized by the e1 and e2 energy parameters (see Fig. 1b).
We perform the MC simulations based on the single-flip Metropolis algorithm using this Hamiltonian. The calculations are performed starting from the disordered lattice with a fixed defect concentration. During a simulation, a lattice site containing a cation state is randomly chosen and its interaction energy Ei is calculated. Then the initial state is randomly changed to one of the remaining cation states and the final energy Ef is obtained. The final state is accepted with a probability min(1,e−ΔE/kBT), where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the thermodynamic temperature and ΔE = Ef − Ei. Afterwards a new lattice site is randomly chosen and the described procedure is repeated.
The simulations are performed on a three dimensional simple cubic lattice of size L × L × L, where L = 10–30 (in units of the lattice constant a). The periodic boundary conditions are implemented to mimic the thermodynamic limit. The thermodynamic averages are calculated by discarding the initial 104–105 and accumulating 105–106 MC steps per lattice site.
The charge screening in our model is studied using the local and integral screening parameters. The local parameter σi expresses the average dipole moment component directed to the defect. It is calculated for each lattice site i containing a MA+ cation as σi = 〈i·ij〉,(5)where i is the unit vector of a cation state at site i. The defect is situated at the lattice site j. The unit vector ij joins defect and MA+ cation sites. The angle brackets denote the MC average. For a cation pointing directly to (from) the defect, σi = 1(−1), while it is zero for the perpendicular arrangement.
The integral screening parameter σ for a single defect is (6)The sum includes all MA+ cation sites that fall into a sphere with volume Vc and radius rc around the defect site. Parameter σ0 is the maximum integral screening attainable in our model. Due to the finite number of the MA+ state orientations, this parameter is smaller than 1 for .
The normalized electric polarization vector of the whole MA+ cation system is calculated as (7)where V = L3, and the sum runs over all sites containing MA+ states.
3 Results and discussion
First, we investigated the arrangement of the MA+ cations around a negative defect site (MA+ vacancy) in MAPbI3. Fig. 2 presents the snapshots of such arrangements in the ab-plane for different values of ecd parameter and temperature. The temperature of 400, 225 and 75 K corresponds to the cubic, tetragonal and orthorhombic phases, respectively. The defect screening is negligible in all phases for ecd = |e1| = 43 meV, since the cations are rapidly fluctuating in the cubic phase. The charge–dipole interaction is too weak to significantly disturb the long-range cation order in the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases. For ecd = 5|e1| = 215 meV, the screening of the charge is more pronounced, as more dipoles point to the defect site. Such value of ecd is also sufficient to disturb the long-range order around the defect in the orthorhombic phase. The screening is best seen for ecd = 10|e1| = 430 meV, where most of the neighboring dipoles are directed to the defect. Note that due to the charge–dipole interaction, the monodomain order is disturbed and breaks into several domains.
 Fig. 2  Arrangement of the MA+ cations around a single negative defect in the ab-plane obtained at different temperatures and ecd interaction energies. Temperatures correspond to the cubic, tetragonal and orthorhombic phases of MAPbI3. The domains of the MA+ cations at 75 K are shaded in different colors. The red circles around the defects mark the apparent screening radius. Other simulation parameters: e1 = −43, e2 = −21, edd = 8.6 meV and rc = 10. 
We also simulated the screening of the lead and halogen vacancies. The snapshots of the MA+ cation arrangement around these defect sites are presented in the ESI† revealing a very similar screening behavior as calculated for the MA+ vacancies. Thus, in the following we concentrate on the MA+ defect screening as such simulations require smaller lattices and are less computationally demanding.
The presented snapshots reveal only a tiny fraction of possible cation distribution around the defect. To investigate the screening effect in more detail, for each lattice site containing a MA+ state, we calculated the average dipole moment component directed to the defect (see eqn (5)). The obtained color maps of such local screening parameter σi are presented in Fig. 3 for a single negative defect in the ab-plane. For brevity, we call such figures the screening maps.
 Fig. 3  Color maps of the local screening parameter σi of a single negative defect in the ab-plane obtained at different temperatures and ecd energies. The screening projections crossing the defect site are indicated on the left and the top of each map. The red curves on the top-projections at 400 K indicate the Lorentzian fits. Other simulation parameters: e1 = −43, e2 = −21, edd = 8.6 meV and rc = 10. 
The obtained maps indicate that the screening for ecd = 43 meV and 400 K is very small, since the nearest-neighbor (NN) dipoles have on average about 0.2p0 component pointing to the defect. For more distant dipoles, σi is practically zero due to the thermal fluctuations. In the tetragonal phase, the partial order assists the screening along one direction, but interferes along the other. A complete long-range order is established at 75 K and the charge-defect interaction is too weak to perturb it. For ecd = 215 meV, the defect screening in the cubic phase is much more efficient, since the average NN dipole component is about 0.8p0. The dipoles form a regular sphere around the defect site indicating an isotropic screening. The screening in the tetragonal phase is anisotropic due to the partially ordered MA+ cations. This effect is even more pronounced in the orthorhombic phase. A similar situation is observed for ecd = 430 meV, where the average NN dipole component is p0 in all phases meaning that these cation states are always directed to the defect. Note the substantially disturbed long-range MA+ order around the defect site in the low temperature phase. The calculated screening maps for a defect in the ac-plane reveal analogous behavior (not presented).
The obtained average screening maps can be used to evaluate the width of the dipole cloud around the defect (screening length λ). For this purpose, we represent σi parameter for lattice sites receding away from the defect along a and b-axes (see the top and the left of each map in Fig. 3). The obtained curves for the cubic phase were approximated with the Lorentzian peak function, and the screening length λ was assigned to the FWHM. Note that due to the screening anisotropy and non-monotonic behavior, we did not extract the screening length for the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases. Fig. 4 presents the temperature and ecd-dependence of λ (expressed in terms of the lattice constant a). The screening length at 350 K roughly ranges from one to four unit cells as ecd is increased from 43 to 430 meV. The decrease of λ with increasing temperature is due to the thermal fluctuations that cause random reorientation of the cation states and reduce the effective screening. However, this effect is rather small in a broad temperature range.

To investigate the screening of a single negative defect in all structural phases of MAPbI3, we calculated the temperature dependence of the integral screening parameter σ (see eqn (6)). The obtained results for different ecd energies are presented in Fig. 5. For ecd ≲ 86 meV, the screening level is very low and stays almost constant as temperature is lowered down to the tetragonal–orthorhombic phase transition at Tc2. Below this temperature σ approaches zero, since the long-range order of the MA+ cations prevails. In contrast, the calculated curves for higher charge–dipole interaction energies approach substantial nonzero values as some of the dipoles remain oriented towards the defect even in the ordered phase. Note that a slight decrease of σ parameter is also observed just below Tc1 due to the established partial order in the tetragonal phase. A further increase of screening with decreasing temperature in this phase is caused by the diminishing thermal fluctuations.

We also studied the screening of two charged defects that are separated by different distances. The screening maps for the same and the opposite charges in the ab-plane are presented in Fig. 6. For oppositely charged defects, the screening is slightly enhanced in the space between them, since the orientation of the MA+ cations is favorable for both defects. The situation is different for the charges of the same sign, since the screening is reduced in the space between them. This behavior occurs because for these MA+ states the charge–dipole interactions partially cancel. As the charges of the same type approach each other, the screening clouds start to merge into a common cloud of bigger radius.
 Fig. 6  Screening maps of two separated defects with the (a) opposite and (b) identical charges. The parameter σi was obtained with respect to the closest charge. Simulation parameters: e1 = −43, e2 = −21, edd = 8.6, ecd = 430 meV, rc = 10 and 400 K. 
We note that the oppositely charged defects can also be considered as the photoexcited electron–hole pair. Thus, our calculations support the idea that the low exciton binding energy may occur due to the screening by the MA+ sublattice.9,35 The measurements of this energy revealed that it increases with decreasing temperature9 which is in a qualitative agreement with our calculations of the temperature dependent screening level for smaller values of ecd (see Fig. 5).
Finally, we investigated the influence of the defects on the long-range MA+ cation arrangement. In our previous study we demonstrated that the cation order in the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases is antipolar meaning that the total spontaneous electric polarization is absent at all temperatures.40 This result was supported by the pyrocurrent measurements of the CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) perovskites that indeed revealed a very small electric polarization. We speculated that a nonzero values were obtained due to the defects in the materials. We further support this idea by calculating the electric polarization for a system containing defects. The temperature dependence of the normalized polarization along a-axis (see eqn (7)) is presented in Fig. 7. The calculated component for different ecd values is zero in the cubic and tetragonal phases in agreement with the defect-free system. However, in the orthorhombic phase the polarization is nonzero for ecd > 0 meV supporting the idea that defects are responsible for the observed small pyrocurrent.40 We note that our polarization calculations involve only the contribution of the MA+ cations. The results of our pyrocurrent experiments and many other studies15,41,42 imply that the polarization of the lead-halide framework is either negligible or canceled in different sublattices. Therefore, in our polarization calculations we ignore the effect of this framework.

Concentration of MA+ vacancy defects is about 1018 cm−3. Other simulation parameters: e1 = −43, e2 = −21, edd = 8.6 meV and rc = 10. 
4 Summary and conclusions
In this study, we investigated screening of the charged point defects by the MA+ dipoles in MAPbI3 perovskite using MC simulations. We employed the statistical model which was previously used to successfully analyze the ordering of the MA+ cations in this system.40 To properly describe the screening, we slightly extended the model by introducing additional MA+ dipole states and incorporating defects at the MA+ sites. The defect interaction with the organic sublattice was implemented via the long-range electrostatic charge–dipole interaction characterized by the energy parameter ecd.
Simulation of screening at different temperatures revealed that for ecd ≲ 43 meV the screening effect is almost negligible in all structural phases of MAPbI3 perovskite. In the cubic and tetragonal phases, the screening is very weak due to the thermal fluctuations, while it is completely quenched by the long-range MA+ order of the orthorhombic phase. For stronger charge–dipole interaction, the screening is present at all temperatures although it is slightly reduced below each phase transition temperature due to the dipole ordering. The screening width in the cubic phase extends to four unit cells around the defect site for ecd = 430 meV which was the highest charge–dipole interaction energy investigated in this study.
We also studied the screening effects of two opposite and identical charges separated by different distance. This calculation is relevant in the context of the photogenerated electron–hole pair separation. We found that for substantial values of ecd parameter the MA+ sublattice contributes to the screening of these carriers. In addition, the temperature dependence of screening level is in a qualitative agreement with the measured temperature behavior of the exciton binding energy.9
Finally, we demonstrated that the defect–dipole interaction can disturb the antipolar MA+ cation order of the orthorhombic phase. This results in the uncompensated dipolar moments of some MA+ cations providing a nonzero value of the total electric polarization. This observation explains the previously reported pyrocurrent measurements that yielded a small value of the polarization.40
In this study the charge–dipole interaction energy ecd was varied in a rather broad range. We expect that the sophisticated ab initio calculations may significantly narrow this interval. This would allow to deduce the most feasible screening regime in the real MAPbX3 systems. In addition, the proposed model is universal, since it can be easily modified to describe the screening effects in materials containing different organic sublattice (e.g. formamidinium) and halide anions.

 	Fig. 2  Arrangement of the MA+ cations around a single negative defect in the ab-plane obtained at different temperatures and ecd interaction energies. Temperatures correspond to the cubic, tetragonal and orthorhombic phases of MAPbI3. The domains of the MA+ cations at 75 K are shaded in different colors. The red circles around the defects mark the apparent screening radius. Other simulation parameters: e1 = −43, e2 = −21, edd = 8.6 meV and rc = 10.	 

 	Fig. 3  Color maps of the local screening parameter σi of a single negative defect in the ab-plane obtained at different temperatures and ecd energies. The screening projections crossing the defect site are indicated on the left and the top of each map. The red curves on the top-projections at 400 K indicate the Lorentzian fits. Other simulation parameters: e1 = −43, e2 = −21, edd = 8.6 meV and rc = 10.	 

 	Fig. 4  Screening width of a single negative defect in the cubic phase at different (a) temperature and (b) ecd values. Other simulation parameters: e1 = −43, e2 = −21, edd = 8.6 meV and rc = 10.	 

 	Fig. 5  Temperature dependence of the integral screening parameter of a single negative defect at different ecd energies. Other simulation parameters: e1 = −43, e2 = −21, edd = 8.6 meV and rc = 4.	 

 	Fig. 6  Screening maps of two separated defects with the (a) opposite and (b) identical charges. The parameter σi was obtained with respect to the closest charge. Simulation parameters: e1 = −43, e2 = −21, edd = 8.6, ecd = 430 meV, rc = 10 and 400 K.	 

 	Fig. 7  Temperature dependence of the electric polarization component along the a-axis in the presence of the negative defects. Calculations performed using different values of ecd parameter. Concentration of MA+ vacancy defects is about 1018 cm−3. Other simulation parameters: e1 = −43, e2 = −21, edd = 8.6 meV and rc = 10.
