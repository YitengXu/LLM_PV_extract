    , Accepted 5th June 2013First published on 11th June 2013AbstractIn the present study, electrical and microstructural properties of electroplated screen-printed Ag metal contacts in crystalline silicon solar cells have been investigated. The metal contacts were formed by a fire-through process at different firing temperatures (700–850 °C) in ambient air. This is followed by a low temperature annealing step at 450 °C in ambient nitrogen. Subsequently, an electroless Ag deposition step using AgNO3 solution under light illumination was performed to improve the electrical properties of the Ag contacts. The specific contact resistance, ρc (Ω-cm2) of the Ag contacts was measured by applying the three-point probe method. It shows that a ρc = 2.16 × 10−5 Ω cm2 was measured for the fire-through Ag contacts. It is found that the specific contact resistance of the fire-through Ag contacts was improved to about 2.35 × 10−6 Ω cm2 after applying an electroless Ag deposition step on the Ag contacts. The cross-sectional view of the Ag metal/doped Si contact region by SEM measurement shows that the Ag metal firmly coalesces with the doped Si region. However, the microstructure of the Ag metal has found a large number of micropores and voids. These may be formed due to the burn off of the volatile organic constituents of the Ag metal paste during the sintering process. The deposition of the pure silver (Ag) metal during the electroless Ag deposition step fills up the micropores and voids in the Ag contacts. As a result, finger conductivity and the electrical properties of the fire-through processed Ag contacts are improved.
Introduction
The screen-printed Ag thick film is the most widely used front side contact metallization scheme in industrially processed silicon solar cells. One of the main objectives of current single crystalline silicon photovoltaic cell research is to enhance the conversion efficiency of the solar cell and to reduce the solar cell cost per watt.1 Different approaches have been experimentally demonstrated to improve the efficiency of the solar cells.2 Another potential area to improve the efficiency of the solar cell is the front side metallization where efforts are mainly focused on the formation of the good quality screen-printed front side Ag contacts.3–6 This is because the formation of the good quality front contacts is necessary for the carrier injection mechanism to occur between the screen-printed Ag metal contact and the doped emitter region of the solar cell. However, formation of the good quality screen-printed Ag contact is difficult due to the complexities associated with glass frit contained in the metal paste. The composition of the Ag metal paste, sintering temperature and emitter surface doping level have a deterministic role in deciding the electrical quality of the screen-printed Ag contacts.7,8 The glass frit also affects the metal powder sintering kinetics.9 Two important parameters in the study of the metal and semiconductor contacts are the contact resistance (Rc) and specific contact resistance (ρc). The specific contact resistance is a particularly useful area-independent parameter for comparing the contacts of different geometries. It is defined as,10 (1)where J is the current density across the metal-to-semiconductor interface and V is the applied voltage across the junction.
The front metal electrodes are usually realized by depositing the Ag metal paste on the silicon nitride (Si3N4) anti-reflection coating (ARC). The rear contact consists of full-area coverage of the Al metallization using the Al paste followed by deposition of the Ag pads. However, when an appropriately thick ARC layer is present between the screen-printed Ag metal contacts and doped Si region, the contact firing needs to be performed at a higher firing temperature in order to improve the barrier properties of the contact structure.6,8 The metallurgy of the contact structure and its detailed electrical behaviour is surprisingly complex when the screen-printable thick film metal pastes used for the contact metallization.6–9,11 This is particularly true in case of the screen-printed fine line front Ag grid contacts. The contact resistance problem of the rear contact is less of an issue than the front electrodes as it is fully covered and the metal paste usually forms a back surface field (BSF) due to the presence of the Al in the silver/aluminium (Ag/Al) paste. However, these metal contacts have a lower aspect ratio due to the limitation of the screen-printing process, and reported to possess a finger conductivity that lowers the efficiency of the solar cells.11 One of the simplest approach to obtain an acceptable value of the contact resistance as well as to improve the finger conductivity of the front Ag contacts of the solar cells, without adding any substantial increase in shadowing losses, is the so-called ‘two layer concept’.12,13 In this approach, first a thin Ag metallic layer is deposited that forms a good contact with the doped emitter region upon sintering. Then, a seed layer with a higher electrical conductivity is deposited on the top of sintered Ag metal contacts. In the present study, electrical and microstructural properties of electroplated screen-printed Ag metal contacts in crystalline silicon solar cells have been investigated. The metal contacts were formed by a fire-through process at different firing temperatures (700–850 °C) in ambient air. This is followed by a low temperature annealing step at 450 °C in ambient nitrogen. Subsequently, an electroless Ag deposition step using AgNO3 solution under light illumination was performed to improve the electrical properties of the Ag contacts.
Experimental
The starting material was (100) oriented boron doped Czochralski (Cz) single crystalline silicon wafers of 1 Ω cm resistivity. The Si wafers were cleaned in trichloroethylene solution to remove the dirt followed by a short-dip in HF solution and 5 min cleaning in de-ionized (DI) water of 18 MΩ resistivity. The n+-Si emitter region was formed by phosphorous diffusion that involves the pre-deposition at 860 °C for 20 min. Subsequently, a drive-in stage is carried out for 10–15 min under nitrogen. The diffusion source consists of liquid phosphorous oxychloride (POCl3) maintained at 18 °C. The phosphorous diffusion was carried in a horizontal diffusion furnace (Inotherm, Inc). The sheet resistance of heavily doped Si emitter region was 42 Ω/sq, measured by a four-point probe method. The phosphorous silicate glass (PSG) formed during the diffusion step was removed by an etching step in dilute HF solution. The edge and junction isolation step was performed in a cold solution of HF (48%):HNO3 (70%):CH3COOH (4%) (1:4:1 by volume ratio). The Si3N4 ARC layer was deposited on the front doped emitter region by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD). The process gases used are ammonia (NH3), nitrogen (N2) and silane (SiH4). The silane flow rate is varied over a wide range to get refractive indices of the Si3N4 films in the range of 1.9–2.2. The details about the deposition system and the deposition parameters have been reported elsewhere.14 The thickness and refractive index of the deposited Si3N4 ARC layer are 85 nm and 1.85, respectively measured with an ellipsometer at the helium:neon laser wavelength of 632.8 nm.
The Ag metal paste was screen-printed on the Si3N4 ARC layer using a semi-automatic DEC245 model screen-printing machine and the rear side of the Si wafer is fully metalized by Al paste followed by the deposition of the Ag pads. The applied metal contacts were then soft baked at 240 °C in an oven under inert ambient conditions in order to remove the chemical binders from the metal paste. The contact sintering consists of a co-firing step which involves a fire-through process at temperatures ranging from 700 to 850 °C in dry air followed by a low temperature annealing step at 450 °C under nitrogen for 15 min.11
An Ag electroless deposition step15 was performed on just the sintered Ag metal electrodes in order to further improve the electrical properties of the fire-through processed Ag contacts of the solar cells. This consists of dipping finished solar cells in an electrolyte containing silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution (5 gm of the AgNO3 pellets dissolved in 100 ml DI water). The light illumination from the top will help to generate an electric current necessarily required for the Ag electroless deposition to proceed. Illuminated current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of finished solar cells were measured under 100 mW cm2 at 25 °C (A.M. 1.5 solar spectrum). The standard power loss equations were applied to evaluate individual contribution to the total power losses associated with the current traveling through various resistive components of the device.16,17 The microstructural properties of the Ag metal contacts were characterized by SEM measurements using the JOEL JSM 6000 model operating at 15 kV. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) equipped with SEM was used to analyze the average elemental composition. The specific contact resistance of the Ag metal electrodes was estimated by applying the three-point probe method.18
The test structure for the contact resistance measurement consists of a slice directly cut from finished solar cells. The scribed part is normally 1 cm wide and typically taken between the two busbars. It consists of only front Ag gridlines in a ladder-like contact pattern as shown in Fig. 1. It has 5 or more parallel and equi-distant planar metal contacts patterned on the doped semiconductor surface. The dimensions of the metal electrodes in the test structure are similar to that of the solar cell grid design. The contact length (W) were designed to ensure the approximation [(Rs/ρc) d] ≫ 1 valid for an electrically long contact.7,19 A current typically below 10 mA is injected between the outer grid contacts that generates a spatially uniform voltage drop (Vn) across the pair of adjacent metal contacts, 1–2, 1–3, 1–4, 1-n patterned on the test structure. The voltage generated between the pair of adjacent metal contacts is directly related to the contact resistance (Rc) of the metal contacts at the interface of the metal and semiconductor and the sheet resistance (Rs) of the doped semiconductor as defined by, (2)where n is the number of the metal contacts (1,2,3…n, etc.) patterned on the semiconductor slab, W is the length of the metal contact, and L is the separation between the metal contacts. Here, d is the width of the metal contact. The 2 in eqn (2) is due to a pair of adjacent metal contacts. Fig. 2 shows the plot of the total resistance (R) as a function of increasing Ag metal gridline spacing (n). The linear least-square fit to experimental data then yields the contact resistance of the metal contacts. The best fit gives the slope of the line as, m = (LRs/W) and the intercept of the straight line on the y-axis gives the 2Rc from which the value of the contact resistance can be deducted.18 The value of the ρc was then estimated from the product of the contact resistance (Rc) and the area of the contact metallization (Ametal) as,10 ρc = RcAmetal(3)

Results and discussion

Fig. 3 shows the SEM cross sectional view of the fire-through processed Ag contact and doped Si surface. The interface of the Ag metal and doped Si contact region is relatively smooth which imply that fire-through processing at higher temperatures has not resulted the formation of any Ag spikes, i.e., the local formation of the Ag intrusion, at the interface of the Ag metal and Si contact region. Therefore, the sintering–annealing step during the fire-through contact formation results in a controlled dissolution etching of heavily doped Si surface at the contact interface by the molten glass contained in the Ag metal paste.20 However, the microstructure of sintered Ag contacts has observed a large number of micropores and voids. It may be resulted from the burn off of the volatile constituents present in the metal paste that is expected to change the viscosity of the metal paste during the contact firing. There are many hypotheses that speculate on chemical interactions taking place between the various constituents of the metal paste during the firing step. At a temperature typically above 600 °C, the glass frit melts and becomes highly reactive in its molten state. This molten glass frit effectively etches the Si3N4 ARC layer deposited over the doped Si emitter. The fire-through process of the contact formation on silicon nitride (Si3N4) ARC has reported that at a temperature of about 820 °C, the molten glass frit is able to etch and dissolve almost 70 nm Si3N4 very quickly.21 When the Si3N4 ARC layer is completely etched or reacted through, the glass frit starts to interact with doped Si surface.6 The glass frit in its molten state exhibits a sufficiently low viscosity to allow an essential rearrangement of the Ag grains and their compaction by capillary action22 improves the grain packing and minimizes the porosity.11,23 In this process, some amount of the silver and Si were also dissolved in the molten glass and the Ag metal diffuses only part of the way through the Si surface.18 The Ag particle begins to sinter concurrently with interfacial reactions and promotes the adhesion of the Ag metal with the doped Si emitter region. As a result, a low-resistance ohmic contact structure between screen-printed Ag metal and doped Si surface is formed.3–5 Upon cooling down, the excess silicon in the glass frit epitaxially crystallizes and some of the dissolved Ag metal in the glass frit precipitates as the Ag crystallites. The reaction of the glass frit and the silicon follows a redox reaction and the reaction mechanism between Si3N4 ARC and the glass frit follows accordingly,24 2PbO + Si → SiO2 + 2Pb(4) 12PbO(glass) + 2Si3N4 → 12Pb + 6SiO2(glass) + 4N2(gas)(5)
 Fig. 3  Cross-sectional view of the Ag metal and doped Si contact region by SEM indicate that the Ag metal is firmly coalesced with the doped SI region upon sintering at a higher firing temperature. 
It shows that during the redox reaction, silicon is oxidized to silicon dioxide (SiO2) and is incorporated into an already existing glass layer. At the same time, lead oxide (PbO) is reduced to elemental lead (Pb).4 The SEM image also indicates that a thin layer of a conductive glassy layer is observed at the interface of the Ag metal and doped Si surface. A large number of tiny Ag crystallites seem to be embedded at the interface of the Ag metal and doped Si contact and form a direct contact with the Si emitter.11 The size, shape and orientation of these Ag crystallites are strongly decided by the composition of the metal paste and firing conditions.3 This is because the amount of borosilicate glass contained in the metal paste is an important factor to promote the adhesion strength of the Ag metal paste with doped Si surface during the initial firing step.8 The tunneling probability through the conductive glassy layer may be increased due to the chemical modification of the glass frit during the firing process. These Ag crystallites have a very small contact area due to the tiny size. The Ag crystallites are believed to have isolated metal–semiconductor contact regions that are responsible for the current transport from the heavily doped Si emitter region to the Ag metal contacts.3 Two mechanisms are believed to dominate the current flow from the Si emitter into the Ag fingers: a direct electron tunneling through the glass layer25 and multi-step carrier tunneling through the metal particles embedded in the glass layer.11 The glassy layer helps to inhibit the Ag diffusion into the doped Si surface during the sintering step.8,11
The typical height and width of the screen-printed front grid line contacts before the sintering step are 15 μm and 100 μm, respectively.1 These metal contacts are expected to cover 8–10% of the total front emitter surface. One way to increase the aspect ratio of the sintered Ag grid contacts without any substantial increase in the shadowing losses is to provide an electroless Ag deposition using AgNO3 under light illumination. Fig. 4 shows the SEM image of the Ag metal contacts plated with pure silver metal. The Ag electroless plating results in the deposition of the pure Ag metal crystallites on sintered Ag metal contacts, thereby fill up micropores and voids in the Ag metal contacts. This enhances the finger conductivity of the Ag metal contacts. Fig. 5 shows the EDAX spectra of the electroplated Ag metal contact. It shows that relative composition of the Ag metal and silicon in the Ag metal/doped Si emitter structure is about 18.22% and 72.26% respectively. Some amount of oxygen (∼9.52%) and lead (1.2%) were also present in the composite. The mean finger width and height of the Ag electroplated metal contacts were evaluated from SEM measurements. Fig. 6 and 7 shows the average finger height and average finger width as a function of the Ag deposition time. It shows that electroplated Ag contacts have a better aspect ratio (height-to-width ratio), resulting in less shading loss from the active metal coverage of finished cells. The average finger height of the front Ag contact is increased to about 16–20 μm indicating pure Ag metal is deposited during the electroless Ag deposition step. SEM observations shows that the finger width is increased to about 114–118 μm. This slight change in the finger width of sintered Ag contacts may be attributed to the glass wettability resulted from the variations in the viscosity of the metal paste during the firing temperature.23 The finger resistivity of the Ag electroplated metal contacts was estimated by measuring the finger resistance with the four-point probe method and was found to be about 4.12 × 10−6 Ω cm. This value is found to be very close to the resistivity of the bulk silver, 1.59 × 10−6 Ω cm.12

The theoretical relationship between the specific contact resistance (ρc) and doping level (Ns) of heavily doped semiconductor surface indicates that specific contact resistance decreases with increasing the surface doping level26–28 and becomes a strong function of the ΦBNS−½,27 (6)where ρco is the specific contact resistance for the infinite active impurity doping level and ΦB is the barrier height. Fig. 8 shows the resultant specific contact resistance of the Ag electrodes after (i) contact sintering at temperature range 700–850 °C and (ii) electroless Ag deposition, respectively. It shows that the ρc of the Ag electrodes has a decreasing trend with the increase in the peak firing temperature. The measurement of specific contact resistance shows that ρc ∼ 2.16 × 10−5 Ω cm2 is obtained for the fire-through Ag contacts. This value of the ρc can be compared with the recently reported value of specific contact resistance, ρc ∼ 1.02 × 10−5 Ω cm2 for the screen-printed Ag metal contacts.29 It is found that the ρc of the fire-through Ag contacts was improved to about ρc = 2.35 × 10−6 Ω cm2 after applying an electroless Ag deposition on the Ag contacts. The improved electrical properties of the Ag contacts sintered at higher firing temperature are attributed to the reduction of the barrier height at the interface of the Ag metal and doped Si emitter. This in turn improves the large value of the contact resistance of the contact structure at the interface of the Ag metal and doped Si emitter. As a result, the potential barrier at the interface of the Ag metal and doped Si contact region is lowered according to the Schottky theory,10 allowing photogenerated carriers to travel across the junction with a small potential drop at the interface of the Ag metal and doped Si region.15

Fig. 9 shows the comparison of the I–V characteristics of typical screen-printed solar cell after (i) contact sintering and (ii) electroless Ag deposition. It shows that the performance of the solar cell is improved after electroless Ag deposition. This improvement is attributed to the reduction of the ohmic losses resulting from a lower finger conductivity of the electroplated Ag metal contacts. It shows that improvements are more evident in case of the fill factor (FF) and the short-circuit current (Isc) of the Ag electroplated solar cell. The electroless Ag deposition has very little influence on the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the device. It shows that initial FF of the solar cell (∼0.69) has improved to about ∼ 0.78 after electroless Ag deposition. As the area of the solar cell increases, the ohmic and shadowing losses due to the grid fingers becomes the dominating factor in deciding the power loss of the solar cell. The following equations are used to calculate the power loss associated with the current travelling through different resistive components of the solar cell normalized to unit cell area,17,29 (7)

Table 1 shows the different physical and electrical parameters measured. Fig. 10 represents the comparison of the power losses of the solar cell after (i) sintering and (ii) Ag electroless plating respectively. It shows that the ohmic losses associated with the contact resistance of the front grid contacts are very small (<3%) as compared to other resistive components. This implies that Ag electroless plating on the screen-printed Ag contacts of the solar cells has resulted excellent electrical quality. The best value of specific contact resistance, ρc ∼ 2.35 × 10−6 Ω cm2 is obtained on electroplated Ag metal contacts.2,10

Conclusion
The effectiveness of the electroless Ag deposition and its effects on the electrical and microstructural properties of the fire-through processed Ag metal contacts of the solar cells have been studied. The SEM and EDAX measurements of the electroplated Ag contacts show that pure silver is deposited on the fire-through processed Ag metal electrodes. As a result, this fills up micropores and voids in the fire-through Ag contacts and hence, improves the finger conductivity of plated Ag contacts. The evaluation of specific contact resistance (ρc) of the Ag contacts by using the three-point probe method has shown that ρc = 2.16 × 10−5 Ω cm2 was measured for the fire-through Ag contacts formed at 850 °C. It is found that the ρc of the fire-through Ag contacts was improved to about ρc = 2.35 × 10−6 Ω cm2 after applying an electroless Ag deposition on the Ag contacts. The improvement in electrical properties of the screen-printed Ag contacts was evaluated by analyzing the illuminated I–V characteristics and power losses associated with the current travelling through various resistive components of the solar cells.
