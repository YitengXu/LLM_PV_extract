    , Accepted 7th March 2019First published on 7th March 2019AbstractThe crystalline quality of the perovskite film plays a key role in improving the optoelectronic properties and the performance of planar perovskite hybrid solar cells (PSCs). In this study, a methodology employing post-annealing microwave treatment (MPAT) for fine tuning the crystallization of perovskite films is proposed. It was found that the microwave induced electromagnetic waves result in the vibration of dipoles and ions at high frequencies in perovskite crystals, which catalyzes the Ostwald ripening process and results in good quality perovskite films. High quality perovskite films were obtained after being subjected to MPAT with 350 watts of power for 25 seconds. The resulting films, demonstrating an inverted solar cell architecture, and showed a champion efficiency of 13.39%. This was a significant improvement in the performance compared to those of the devices employing films without MPAT treatment (PCE = 11.5%). The MPAT provides a way to prepare high quality perovskite films that are of particular significance for the manufacturing of large area perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
In only a few years, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved great accomplishments. The photovoltaic power conversion efficiency (PCE) has increased from 3.8% to 23.3%1 and is very close to the theoretical efficiency of ∼31%.2,3
The photovoltaic performance of PSCs is attributed to not only the morphology5,6 and composition7 of the perovskite films, but also the charge extracting capacity of the hole and electron transporting layers.8–10 The homogeneous thermal gradient demonstrated over an entire area of substrate is one of the key factors deciding the quality of the perovskite film.11,12
Wang et al. used an imidazole doping treatment for the PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer to tune the pH value, resulting in an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 15% for CH3NH3PbI3 based inverted perovskite solar cells.4 However, for the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite absorber with an inverted architecture, the efficiency still lacked behind. For CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, it was reported that the film was annealed at 100 °C for 90 min.13 However, the conventional hot plate annealing process often suffers from inhomogeneous thermal gradients over large areas, resulting in inhomogeneous crystallization for perovskite films and poor reproducibility for high efficiency solar cells.20,34 Alternative processes have recently been developed to replace the traditional annealing process. These include hot-pressing,14 solvent annealing,15,16 IR radiation17 and ultrasonic vibration.18–20 Unfortunately, all these methods are time-consuming. Therefore, it is of key importance to quickly find alternative methods for the conventional annealing technology. Herein, we proposed a microwave post-annealing treatment (MPAT) that can generate a more homogeneous thermal domain for solvent evaporation, and the co-associated high frequency vibration can improve the Ostwald ripening process by fusing smaller crystals into large crystallites.35,36 Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging from one meter to one millimeter.21–23 Over the last 30 years, microwave treatment technologies have had breakthrough achievements in photoelectron manufacturing.24–27 For example, the microwave technology has improved the heating rate and thermal efficiency, and most strikingly solved the problem of uneven heating over a large area.28–30 Moreover, electromagnetic radiation can cause vibration of the electrons and dipoles in the atoms present in the absorber layer.31 For the perovskite absorber annealing process, the microwave technology is ideal to provide a more homogeneous and high-efficiency thermal annealing environment.32,33
It was reported that microwave irradiation is useful for many functions.31,36–38 Cao et al. previously reported the use of microwave irradiation for obtaining good quality CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films that resulted in a 14.91% device efficiency.39 The difficulty involved in tuning the chlorine/iodine ratio should be considered.40,41 In this study, we demonstrated the use of microwave post-annealing treatment (MPAT) to form good quality mixed halide CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite films. Application of MPAT resulted in a more homogeneous thermal domain to evaporate the solvent. At the same time, the co-associated high frequency vibration improved the Ostwald ripening process by fusing smaller crystals into large crystallites.35,36 Unlike the conventional annealing process at 100 °C for 90 minutes, the MPAT involves microwave post-annealing treatment (MPAT) where a perovskite absorber is radiated with microwaves for thermal annealing at 100 °C for 70 minutes. In this hybrid processing treatment, microwave treatment allows for the formation of homogeneous perovskite catalytic grains at regular intervals and the annealing enhances the high quality crystal growth.
CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite films prepared using MPAT showed homogeneous and high quality crystalline growth as confirmed by X-ray diffraction, UV-Vis spectroscopy and surface morphology characterization. As a result, the employment of solar cells yielded a champion performance of 13.39%. This is a much higher performance compared to those of the devices made using conventional annealing (efficiency of 11.58%).
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials and preparation
Poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) was purchased from Heraeus (Germany). Lead(II) chloride (PbCl2) (99.999%) and anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (99.9%) were purchased from Alfa-Aesar. PCBM and Bphen were produced by Nichem Fine Technology Co., Ltd (Taiwan).
Methylamine iodide synthesis (CH3NH3I): 20 mL of hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in H2O) was added to 48 mL of methanol (40 wt%) in an ice bath and the solution was stirred for 2 h. Then, the resulting solution was distilled in a rota-evaporator at 55 °C to remove the solvents. The precipitate was washed with diethyl ether 3 times. Finally, a white powder was collected and dried at 60 °C for 24 h under vacuum.
Perovskite precursor solution preparation: the mixture of PbCl2:CH3NH3I with 1:3 molar ratios was dissolved in DMF and then stirred at 60 °C overnight. The solution was filtered using a 0.45 μm filter and directly used for spin coating.
Microwave equipment: for microwave irradiation, Whirlpool MAX39 equipment was used (Fig. S1, ESI†). The selected power of the microwave radiation was tuned to 150 W, 350 W and 500 W.
2.2. Solar cell fabrication
The ITO-coated glass substrate (15 Ω sq−1) underwent ultrasonic-coating in acetone and ethanol at room temperature for 20 minutes, followed by UV-Ozone cleaning for 15 minutes. The PEDOT:PSS films with a thickness of ≈45 nm were spin-coated onto the ITO substrate at 4500 rpm and annealed at 140 °C for 25 minutes. The as-prepared perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm. For the reference cell, the conventional thermal annealing process was employed to prepare the perovskite films. This involved a gradual increase in the temperature from 60 to 100 °C at a rate of 10 °C/10 minutes. Then, the cell was subjected to annealing on the hot plate for 90 minutes. For the MPAT processed perovskite films, the cell was also annealed at 100 °C like the reference device, but the subsequent placement time was 70 minutes instead of 90 minutes on the hot plate. The cells placed for 70 minutes were irradiated with microwaves in a confined glass chamber purged with a nitrogen environment. The microwave power and the irradiation time can strongly influence the quality of the perovskite film. A number of sets were investigated using microwaves to irradiate the perovskite films. It was found that the sets of 160 W-30 s, 350 W-25 s and 500 W-15 s exhibited good reproducibility for obtaining high-quality perovskite films. Once the perovskite films were deposited, the PCBM layer was deposited using a 20 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene solution at 2000 rpm. 0.5 mg mL−1 of Bphen in absolute ethanol was coated onto the PCBM layer at 4000 rpm. Finally, 100 nm thick Ag (mask area of 0.0725 cm2) was deposited on top of the Bphen layer by thermal evaporation under 10−4 Torr.
2.3. Characterization
Perovskite solar cells were fabricated in the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Perovskite/BCP/PCBM/Au architecture. The J–V characteristics, open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) response and dark current were tested using a programmable Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5 G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). The incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was measured with a 1000 W halogen lamp and grating monochromator (Acton Spectra Pro 2300i). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was surveyed by an IM6e electrochemical work station (ZAHNER, Germany). The dielectric constant (εr) and the corresponding dissipation factor (δ) as a function of frequency were measured using a precision impedance analyser (Agilent 4294A). The absorption spectra were measured with an UV-Vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 750). The surface and cross-sectional morphologies were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta 200 FEG, FEI Co.). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was obtained using the PAN Analytica 80 equipment (Empyrean, Cu Kα radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm). In order to evaluate the solar cell stability, the non-encapsulated devices were exposed to ambient air.
3. Results and discussion
The films subjected to MPAT (160 W-30 s, 350 W-25 s and 500 W-15 s) showed an enhanced crystallization and absorbance compared to those by the films prepared using conventional annealing (reference devices). This was evidenced by the enhanced X-ray diffraction patterns and UV-Vis absorbance spectra (Fig. 1(e and f)). It was found that the devices prepared using the MPAT showed improved JV characteristics compared to those of the reference devices. The JV characteristics and EQE measurements are shown in Fig. 1(a and b). The detailed results are listed in Table 1.

Particularly, the films subjected to 350 W-25 s MPAT processing showed the highest performance of 13.39% hysteresis-free efficiency (Jsc = 17.70, Voc = 0.99 and fill factor = 0.74). However, the reference perovskite cells showed a PCE of 11.5% (Jsc = 16.56, Voc = 0.96 and fill factor = 0.71) with significant hysteresis. The statistical data for 30 devices prepared with and without MPAT perovskite films are presented in Fig. S5 (ESI†).
The IPCE curves of the PSCs prepared by different annealing processes are shown in Fig. 1b. The devices prepared by employing MPAT treatment had a higher IPCE value in the 300–800 nm wavelength range compared to those of the reference devices as a result of the improved quality of the films after MPAT treatment. For the films subjected to MPAT 350 W-25 s, the integrating current density reached 17.67 mA cm−2 (Fig. 1(a)), which was further confirmed by the Jsc value obtained from the EQE measurements (Fig. 1(b)). The PCEs of the cells with MPAT at 350 W-25 s and reference cells are presented in Fig. 1c. The statistics for 30 devices employing the perovskite films processed with MPAT (350 W-25 s) showed a narrow distribution, indicating the excellent reproducibility of the devices (Fig. S5, ESI†).
The open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) response time of the solar cell was used to investigate the photovoltage and charge recombination dynamics at the perovskite and PEDOT:PSS interface. As shown in Fig. 1d, the OCVD data of the cells includes three parts. (i) Formation of the photovoltage with illumination. As illustrated, the voltage of the films with MPAT was larger than those of the reference devices. (ii) The decay time of the photovoltage with the light shutter is defined as . The voltage decay in the films with the MPAT took a longer time to reach a flat and steady value. This meant that more compact and smooth perovskite films were formed by a MPAT, which could possibly be reducing the charge recombinations.42–44 From the curves, the obtained lifetime of the photovoltage for the perovskite devices employing the MPAT processed films was longer (0.45–1.2 s) than those of the reference cells (0.3 s). (iii) The dark recovery step provided information about the enhanced electrostatic potential (Velec) of the interface using the equation Voc = Vbi + Velec.45 Because of MPAT, the devices had a high Velec, which resulted in a high Voc. The crystallization of the perovskite films is one key factor in the photoelectric performance of the PSCs. Thus, we further characterized the perovskite film characteristics using ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. The results are listed in Fig. 1e and f. For the UV-Vis absorption, the perovskite films with MPAT (350 W-25 s) showed the strongest absorption intensity as well as crystalline quality. Based on the XRD analysis, the main diffraction intensities of the film with MPAT at 14.2° increased considerably, thus confirming the improved crystallinity of the perovskite films.46
Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic waves. Thus, the main effect of the electric component should be considered in this study. Dielectric relaxation is the momentary lag in the dielectric constant, which relates to the ionic or electronic polarization of the perovskite films. Therefore, the capacitance of the solar cells is measured as a function of frequency. Fig. 2a and b present the dissipation factor (tanδ) and the relative dielectric constant (εr) for the PSCs with and without MPAT under darkness at room temperature, respectively. As previously mentioned, MPAT can induce the thermal annealing effect and the polarization effect along the electric field of the microwave. This effect will result in the formation of highly ordered, homogeneous crystalline domains for MPAT processed films. Enhanced crystal planes (110, 2θ = 14.9°) could be detected from the X-ray diffraction measurement of the MPAT processed films. The crystalline, homogeneous films can also induce an enhanced effect on the dielectric constant. Fig. 2a shows that at low and high frequency,47 the dielectric constant, εr, did not show a similar trend for the films prepared with and without MPAT processing. However, in the middle frequency, the proper MPAT processed films induced an obvious effect on the dielectric measurement. This is possibly due to the lower dissipation factors (tanδ) (Fig. 2b).

The measured capacitance as a function of the forward bias (C–V) for the devices is summarized in Fig. 2c, where the positive pole was set on the ITO plate and the DC voltage was swept from 0 V to 1.1 V at a frequency of 10 kHz. The capacitance can be written as48 (1)where q is the applied elementary charge, V is the applied forward bias, ND is the carrier density and Vbi is the built-in potential. The inverse capacitance squared, 1/C2, should be a linear function of V, whose intersection with the voltage axis yields the extrapolated Vbi.49 and the slope of the linear region yields the ND.48 The detailed results are listed in Table 2. In the linear region, the perovskite films with MPAT generated a decreased Vbi and an increased ND. For the reduced Vbi, the pre-polarization charge came from the bipolar perovskite molecules that formed the built-in potential and was disturbed by the microwaves in the MPAT process. The increased ND also indicates that there were fewer defects in the perovskite film because of the high quality films obtained with MPAT processing. Furthermore, the increased ND gave a larger contribution to the Velec. Therefore, with MPAT, the Voc still showed an increasing trend compared to those of the reference cells although the Vbi decreased according to the equation Voc = Vbi + Velec.

The surface morphology SEM images and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images showed the excellent quality of the MPAT processed perovskite films. The top-view SEM images of the perovskite films with and without MPAT processing are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. For 350 W-25 s MPAT, smooth-compact and pinhole free perovskite films were formed. Moreover, the mean grain size of the perovskite crystal was estimated using a Nano measure program. The statistical result is shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). It was found that the grain size of the film with MPAT (350 W-25 s) reached 1538.96 nm, which was larger than the grain size of the reference films (943.35 nm). The three-dimensional (3-D) AFM micro-graphs of the films with and without MPAT processing are presented in Fig. 3c and d, respectively. As illustrated, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the perovskite film for the MPAT (350 W-25 s) processed films was about 13 nm. This value is lower than that of the reference films without MPAT processing (21.3 nm). In summary, the SEM and AFM measurements further confirmed that MPAT gives high-quality perovskite films.

(e) and (f) SEM cross-section of the respective photovoltaic devices prepared by employing the perovskite processed with MPAT and without MPAT. 

Fig. 3(e and f) present the cross-sections of the devices prepared without and with MPAT treatment, respectively. The solar cell employing the MPAT processed perovskite films showed a denser and thicker monolithic perovskite absorber layer with less pinholes than the perovskite films without MPAT treatment. The stability of the non-encapsulated solar cells prepared with and without MPAT processing was measured at 1 sun illumination and in an ambient atmosphere (>25% humidity). The MPAT (350 W at 25 s) processed perovskite devices exhibited a better stability, even after 240 hours of continuous 1 sun illumination. In contrast, the efficiency of the reference devices prepared without MPAT treatment rapidly decreased by half after 100 hours of illumination (Fig. S7, ESI†). For the as-deposited perovskite films, there were unevaporated DMF solvent, MA+ cations and [PbI6]4− cage nanoparticles. Therefore, MPAT and associated electromagnetic vibration can energetically prompt the small particles to fuse together, leading to the formation of large crystal grains. In addition, the electromagnetic vibration can also drive the hollow perovskite grain to become solid, which results in larger and high-quality crystallization. As a result, the grain boundaries were seamed and pinholes padded showing Ostwald ripening. Fig. 4 and Fig. S8 (ESI†) show the different SEM images of the reference film and the film with MPAT at 350 W with different times for the reference film (5 s, 25 s and 35 s). The corresponding UV-Vis spectra and XRD patterns are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†).11,30 Results demonstrate that the MPAT with 350 W 25 s was the proper condition to induce Ostwald ripening in crystals. However, an increased MPAT time resulted in the decomposition of the perovskite into PbI2 and MAI12,39 (Fig. S10, ESI†), leading to the appearance of pinholes. The schematic presented in Fig. 4e shows the crystallization process for the perovskite films with a MPAT time from 5 s to 35 s.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated a hybrid treatment that combines the advantages of microwave treatment followed by annealing (MPAT) to obtain reproducible, high-quality CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite films in an ambient environment without the use of conventional anti-solvent methods that require mandatory and expensive glove-box processing. The improved quality of the perovskite films after MPAT was confirmed from the UV-Vis spectra, X-ray diffraction studies and SEM images. The films prepared using the MAPT were employed in the inverted device architecture, and yielded an improved performance, reproducibility and less-hysteresis compared to those of the films prepared without MPAT processing. The advantages and the mechanistic insights of MPAT on the superior quality of perovskite films make this technique beneficial for the large-scale fabrication of high-quality mixed halide films.
