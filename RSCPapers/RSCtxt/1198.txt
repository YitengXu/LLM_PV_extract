    First published on 26th May 2020AbstractFurans represent one of the most important classes of intermediates in the conversion of non-edible lignocellulosic biomass into bio-based chemicals and fuels. At present, bio-furan derivatives are generally obtained from cellulose and hemicellulose fractions of biomass via the acid-catalyzed dehydration of their relative C6–C5 sugars and then converted into a wide range of products. Furfural (FUR) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) are surely the most used furan-based feedstocks since their chemical structure allows the preparation of various high-value-added chemicals. Among several well-established catalytic approaches, hydrogenation and oxygenation processes have been efficiently adopted for upgrading furans; however, harsh reaction conditions are generally required. In this review, we aim to discuss the conversion of biomass derived FUR and HMF through unconventional (transfer hydrogenation, photocatalytic and electrocatalytic) catalytic processes promoted by heterogeneous catalytic systems. The reaction conditions adopted, the chemical nature and the physico-chemical properties of the most employed heterogeneous systems in enhancing the catalytic activity and in driving the selectivity to desired products are presented and compared. At the same time, the latest results in the production of FUR and HMF through novel environmental friendly processes starting from lignocellulose as well as from wastes and by-products obtained in the processing of biomass are also overviewed.

1. Introduction
In the past century, the fossil-based industry opened the door to the modern era allowing not only an economic growth but also our cultural and scientific progress. This global development has been accompanied by a consolidation of the industrial chemistry that played an important role in ensuring fuels, fertilizers/agrochemicals, detergents, pharmaceuticals, food additives, polymers and textiles. In the collective imagination, fossil resources appeared so far endless, ready-available and low-cost thus generating the development of a disposable society. Today we are paying the price of the extensive use of fossil reserves and we are dealing with the necessity to preserve global resources. Moreover, the projected increase of the world population and of the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita will have a deep impact on the global economy and on the cumulative energy demand.1,2 In this context, the real challenge of the industrial chemistry is to guarantee the production of chemicals and materials that can improve our everyday life reducing, at the same time, their environmental impact in line with the “12 Green Chemistry principles” and the “benign-by-design concept” (the design of efficient, economically viable and environmentally benign chemical processes).3,4
In 2015, the United Nations adopted the “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” with 17 Goals and 169 targets aimed at achieving a shared global vision towards a sustainable development.5
The chemical industry can contribute significantly to reaching these goals in the framework of four key pillars:6
– low-carbon economy: the reduction of CO2 emissions and of other greenhouse gases (GHGs) by using clean and renewable technologies;
– resource efficiency: the design of more efficient chemical processes with less energy and material inputs;
– circular economy: the recycling, reuse and valorization of waste raw materials;
– care for people and planet: the development of products with minimum impacts on health, safety, security and environment (HSSE) improvements.
Lignocellulosic biomass, including hardwoods, softwoods, grasses, agricultural residues and urban wastes, is a globally available and renewable carbon-neutral resource that represents the most viable alternative for the sustainable production of biofuels and bioderived chemicals.7–16
The main components of lignocellulosic biomass are cellulose (30–50 wt%), hemicellulose (20–40 wt%) and lignin (10–20 wt%) with a weight percentage composition that may significantly vary in passing from plant species to residues and wastes.17 Cellulose and hemicellulose (mainly formed of C6–C5 sugars) are compressed in a lignin shelter composed of etheric aromatic monomers.18 Before their direct use as bio-feedstocks, physico-chemical pre-treatments generally need to be carried out with the aim to (i) break down the complex structure of lignocellulose; (ii) reduce the cellulose crystallinity; (iii) preserve pentoses from hemicellulose improving the sugar availability; (iv) maintain unaltered the aromatic structure of lignin and (v) limit the formation of degradation products.19–27
Together with mechanical, catalytic, physico-chemical and biological pretreatments, integrated reductive catalytic fractionation processes (lignin-first approach) gained a lot of attention.28–30 Once the lignocellulose is deconstructed, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin fractions can be subsequently converted into platform chemicals, that can be further transformed into target molecules, added value chemicals, solvents and materials.31–40
A list of the most promising bio-derived platform molecules was released in 2004 by the U.S. Department of Energy and updated and revisited by Bozell and Petersen in 2010.41,42 Among them, furfural (FUR) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) are getting increasing consideration being versatile biobased C5 and C6 platform molecules. While some precautions need to be taken in the use of furans and its derivatives as “green solvents” due to their higher toxicity level than standard petrochemical solvents (furfural, for example, is qualified as a dangerous substance and listed under various internationally derived hazardous-material classifications as CMR carcinogen with toxic effects on the human body),43–46 their use as biobased starting substrates for the production of biorefinery building blocks and materials is generally recognized (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Lignocellulosic catalytic upgrading to added value chemicals via furfural (FUR) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) platform molecules. 
Furfural is obtained from hemicellulose-derived xylose or from other pentose rich polysaccharides.43,47–53 The furfural market size is projected to grow from EUR 500 million in 2019 to EUR 630 million by 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.9% with Austria, Belgium, China, Dominican Republic, India, Italy, Slovenia, South Africa and US being the key market players.54 While almost 100 chemicals can be directly or indirectly produced from FUR,55,56 at present, furfuryl alcohol (FAL), tetrahydrofuran (THF), maleic anhydride (MA), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) and 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PeOL) are the main furan-derivatives manufactured on a commercial scale.54
5-Hydroxymethylfurfural is produced from the dehydration of hexoses (mainly fructose) or via acid-catalyzed hydrolysis/dehydration of cellulose.57–64 A slower growth of the HMF worldwide market, with respect to FUR, is expected (EUR 55 million in 2024 from EUR 50 million in 2019 with a 1.4% CAGR).65 The presence of both an aldehydic and a hydroxymethyl group permits the conversion of HMF into a plethora of high value products such as 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), levulinic acid (LA), γ-valerolactone (GVL), 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furan carboxylic acid (HMFCA), 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF), 5-formyl-furan carboxylic acid (FFCA) and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA).66–71
Even if HMF has enormous potential to become one of the most important C6-platform chemicals for biorefinery (it is widely known as “the sleeping giant” of sustainable chemistry),72 at present, its high production costs limit its competitiveness at an industrial scale.19,71 The use of HMF as a renewable commodity in the biobased chemical industry requires a scale-up production of 100–1000 KTA (kilo metric ton per annum).72 Nonetheless, economic aspects, such as feedstock prices and the performance of industrial processes, also need to be taken into account. The overall economics of HMF production at an industrial scale can be surely improved by using “real” cheap biomass as the starting feedstock. Non-edible biomass and food wastes represent a valid alternative to glucose and fructose.73–76 Food wastes (e.g. vegetables, fruits, cooked rice, bread, pasta and beverage waste) represent a valid HMF resource being characterized by a high concentration of starchy carbohydrates, cellulose and free soluble sugars. In particular, beverage and fruit squeezing wastes (rich in simple sugars such as glucose, fructose and sucrose) are getting more and more attention as a renewable resource for large production volumes of HMF.77
In the presence of molecular hydrogen, FUR and HMF can undergo many reaction processes including CO and CC hydrogenation, decarbonylation and C–O and C–C hydrogenolysis (Fig. 2 and 3).67,68,78–83 Catalytic hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions have been largely studied since they allow the reduction of the oxygen content in furan as well as in other biomass-derived platform molecules.37,40,84,85 Hence, several noble (Pt, Pd, Ru, Co) and non-noble (Cu, Ni, Fe) monometallic and bimetallic heterogeneous catalysts have been efficiently adopted in the reductive upgrading of FUR and HMF.85–109

 Fig. 3  Simplified reductive and oxidative catalytic transformations of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to added value chemicals. 
Also the oxidation reactions of furans have attracted the attention of researchers since a wide range of important commodity chemicals can be produced (Fig. 2 and 3).34,80 Among many, the catalytic oxidation of HMF allows the production of FDCA which is one of the two key starting building blocks for the production of polyethylene furanoate (PEF), a 100% bio-based polymer that should replace in the next years polyethylene terephthalate (PET).110,111 PEF shows excellent barrier properties towards water, oxygen and carbon dioxide being characterized by a higher glass transition temperature and a tensile strength when compared with PET.111 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid will reach the market value of around EUR 770 million in 2025 with a CAGR of about 11%.112
Avantium Holding BV has currently a pilot plant in Geleen (Netherlands) for the production of PEF (and is planning the construction of a 5 kilotons FDCA flagship plant).113 Other chemical companies developed proprietary catalytic technologies for the production of FDCA (ADM and Good Scents Co, Alfa Aesar Gmbh, Asta tech Inc, AVA-Biochem, Carbone Scientific, Chemsky, Corbion Purac, Novamont S.p.A., Satachem, SynbiaS, Stora Enso, Tokyo Chemical Industries, V&V Pharma Industries). For example, in October 2019, Novamont S.p.A. announced a 10 million-euro investment for the construction in Italy of a demonstration plant dedicated to FDCA production based on the catalytic oxidation of HMF.114 The market makers’ expectation is that PEF will not reach the volumes and price points of PET, at least in the near future.115 Thus, PEF will enter a commercial niche market where barrier performance, mechanical properties and recyclability are key factors driving the consumer choice (e.g. multilayers, films).116
Heterogeneous Au-based systems are surely the most extensively investigated catalysts for the oxidation of bioderived furans.117–125 Other heterogeneous catalysts, based on noble metals such as Pt, Pd, Ru and Ag, show good results in the conversion of HMF into HFCA, FDCA and DFF.126–140 Reactions are generally carried out in the presence of a base promoter, in the temperature range of 100–150 °C by using molecular oxygen as the oxidizing agent (1–10 hours reaction time).113–142
In the course of the years, we have witnessed the publication of several important reviews based on both hydrogenation and oxidation of biomass derived furans into added value chemicals.19,34,68,78–83
Therefore, the aim of the present review is to go beyond “traditional” preparation methods of furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and their “classical” thermocatalytic reductive and oxidative reactions, highlighting recent contributions via unconventional catalytic upgrading (benign-by-design processes instinctively devoted to environmental sustainability) promoted by heterogeneous catalytic systems.
Moreover, innovative preparation methods will be addressed including novel technologies, such as microwave-assisted synthesis, effective catalytic materials and solvent systems, as well as different strategies, for instance combining chemo and enzymatic catalysis.
With respect to the catalytic upgrading reactions, a particular emphasis will be given to the transfer hydrogenation (CTH),143–146 electrocatalytic (ECR)147–154 and photocatalytic (PCR)155–162 processes that are emerging as green and sustainable leading approaches for the conversion of biomass derived furans, with a discussion on the role of heterogeneous catalysts in driving the product selectivity. These processes are directly competing with the standard reductive and oxidative conversion of FUR and HMF since, in the presence of an appropriate heterogeneous catalyst, they generally require milder experimental conditions and the use of an indirect hydrogen- or oxygen-source achieving, at the same time, high selectivity in the production of a target product in the framework of the principles of the green chemistry.
2. Recent advances in the catalytic production of furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
As mentioned above, furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural can be obtained by acid hydrolysis and dehydration of carbohydrates (xylose, glucose and fructose).
The synthesis of furfural can be achieved through the acid-assisted depolymerisation of pentosans to xylose and its further dehydration to furfural. This preparation procedure can be performed following a one-step process, where the acid cleavage of pentosans and the dehydration take place concurrently, or a two-step process, by dissolution and depolymerisation of the carbohydrate under moderate conditions and subsequent dehydration to furfural.163–165 Hydrolysis of hemicelluloses involves a four step mechanism involving
(1) the protonation of the oxygen forming the bridging etheric bond;
(2) the formation of a carbocation and a hydroxyl group by scission of the oxygen etheric bond;
(3) the reaction of the aforementioned carbocation with water;
(4) the final formation of a hydroxyl group by deprotonation of the intermediate.
In the first instance, furfural formation from xylose can occur through protonation of O-pyranose, 1-OH or 2-OH groups.166 In the case of protonation of pyranose oxygen, the reaction pathway goes through an “acyclic” mechanism via a ring opening intermediate. On the other hand, a direct “cyclic” mechanism is suggested in the case of protonation of 1- or 2-OH groups.
Furfural production by dehydration of monosaccharides includes two consecutive 1,2 eliminations followed by a 1,4 elimination. In this regard, the 1,2 elimination affords two CC bonds, while the 1,4 elimination leads to the cyclization of the ensuing molecule, leading to the final formation of FUR.50,167
The HMF synthesis from glucose has been explained on the basis of several mechanistic pathways, including both cyclic and acyclic routes. The reaction can, in some cases, take place through fructose isomerization and it has been suggested that the acyclic mechanism occurs by protonation of the oxygen in the glucose ring. The consequent ring opening can be followed either by the aldose acyclic mechanism or by an isomerization process leading to fructose. In turn, the cyclic mechanism goes through a previous 2-OH protonation followed by fructose formation involving a furanose tertiary carbocation, or through HMF formation via furanose secondary carbocation.166,168
A lot of investigations have been focused on finding innovative and efficient protocols for the preparation of HMF and FUR, using catalytic materials, solvent systems, feedstocks and suitable reaction conditions.83,169–174 The direct transformation of biomass has received a lot of attention from the scientific community, since it could represent an innovative and crucial advance towards sustainability by the chemical industry. Several biomass derived feedstocks have been employed for the production of both chemicals. For instance, the use of sugarcane bagasse, eucalyptus wood and corn stalk has been reported.175,176
When corncob was treated with a biphasic system formed by water (diluted with sulfuric acid) and toluene, a 65.67 mol% of furfural yield was obtained after 10 min of reaction.175 Most of the furfural content, namely 84.73%, was found in the toluene phase, which greatly favors its recovery (Fig. 4).175

The corn stover has also been employed for the synthesis of furfural. In this case, a catalytic material based on sulfonated and thermally treated calcium citrate was tested, achieving a 51.5% yield of furfural under moderate reaction conditions and in aqueous media. Moreover, the developed procedure could have potential applications at the industrial scale.176
In another example, poplar wood was treated with p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH) at low temperature (below 90 °C), resulting in fractionation into a water-insoluble cellulosic solid and a liquid extract enriched in lignin and xylan (Fig. 5). Such fractions were used for the production of furfural. In particular, a direct dehydration of the liquor fraction leads to a higher furfural yield (68.4%) and concentration (5.44 g L−1).177

Southern cattail was found to be an attractive feedstock for the extraction of hemicellulose and its further conversion into furfural. In this case, the best results for the hydrolysis of the raw material were obtained by using a temperature of 177–189 °C in 30–45 minutes. This process, under optimum conditions, converts xylans into furfural with an overall yield of 20–25%. The so obtained furfural was then separated by extraction with chloroform and subsequent distillation.178
Moreover, humins could represent a novel and less explored source of HMF. Recent studies on humin decomposition and structure elucidation have indicated that such biomass derived residues, which are inevitably and undesirably produced in several industrial processes, afford HMF and 5-methoxymethylfuran-2-carbaldehyde (MMF) by transfer-hydrogenolysis. Remarkably, a continuous flow regime was used in the aforementioned reaction.178,179 Continuous-flow conditions have been also employed for D-fructose dehydration into HMF, in the presence of several ion exchange resins, including Amberlyst-15 and DR-2030, as solid acid-catalysts. These studies reveal promising results, since high HMF yields are reached (up to 80%) suggesting that the continuous flow strategy could open new opportunities for scalable processes.180,181
In another case, the watermelon peel was used as a feedstock for the production of HMF, with potential industrial applications. It is worth highlighting that the work developed by Zhao et al. includes an economic analysis, demonstrating that 1 t of watermelon peel could lead to 1.52 kg of HMF. Interestingly, the transformation was carried out by employing a microwave-assisted hydrothermal liquefaction process.181
Microwave technologies could represent a novel and noteworthy possibility for the production of FUR and HMF, taking into account their inherent advantages pertaining to low reaction times and their high yields.182,183 As well, microwave-assisted synthesis could lead to products and reaction pathways that usually are not found under conventional heating protocols.184
In this regard, the influence of microwave irradiation on the hydrolysis of xylan and the concurrent epimerization of D-xylose to D-lyxose has been studied. Such monosaccharides were further dehydrated to furfural, achieving a 53% FUR yield. The microwave strategy gave rise to higher conversion values and faster reaction times, in comparison with conventional heating approaches.184 Carrion-Prieto and co-workers have also developed a microwave-assisted protocol for the valorization of Cistus ladanifer L. and Erica arborea L. biomass hydrolysates, leading to HMF and FUR formation.185
Furthermore, microwave assisted dehydration of fructose into HMF, employing HCl as a homogeneous acid catalyst, has been accomplished. Remarkable values of fructose conversion (52%) and HMF selectivity (63%) were achieved in only 1 s of reaction time at 200 °C, under microwave irradiation. It was observed that at higher reaction times (up to 60 s), higher fructose conversion occurs, but, at the same time, a lower HMF yield is obtained.186 Microwave protocols have been also employed for the production of furfural by catalytic torrefaction of the douglas fir sawdust, employing metal chlorides and hydrochloric acid as catalytic systems.187
The scalability of microwave technologies is hindered by several limitations including the restricted penetration depth of irradiation (normally around a few centimeters, at the typical frequency of 2.45 GHz) into absorbing materials, solvents/reaction-media. In the light of this physical limitation, microwave continuous flow reactors have been recently developed.188 In this case, the reaction mixture passes through a small microwave heated flow cell, avoiding the aforementioned penetration depth issues.189–191
Importantly, the use of effective and selective catalytic materials is a crucial factor that can lead to more efficient processes for FUR and HMF production.192 Nowadays, furfural is commercially synthesized under both batch and continuous flow conditions employing mineral acids. Formic acid has also been reported as a catalyst for the production of furfural from xylose.173 As well, an initial research study concerning the preparation of HMF implies the use of bench acids.193–195 Such homogeneous catalysts possess inherent disadvantages associated to their toxic and corrosive nature, as well as a difficult recovery procedure. Therefore, many investigations have been focused on the design of novel heterogeneous catalytic materials.
For instance, Len et al. have, so far, reported the design of a nature inspired catalytic system based on the acidity of sporopollenin (Fig. 6).196 This natural biopolymer, which can be found on the outer walls of pollen grains, was modified by a sulfonation reaction, enhancing its acid properties. The catalytic performance of such innovative material was examined in the microwave-assisted dehydration of D-xylose and xylan to furfural, reaching 69% and 37% yield, respectively. Remarkably, the catalytic material displayed outstanding stability, allowing its reuse up to 10 times, without loss of activity.196 In this sense, the transformation of xylose into furfural employing functionalized carbonaceous materials has also been reported. In particular, starbons, which are a family of mesoporous carbons derived from polysaccharides (such as starch and chitosan), were modified with sulfonic groups achieving a 70 mol% of furfural yield with full xylose conversion.197

Conversion of xylose into furfural has been also studied in the presence of γ-Al2O3 and CaCl2. In this case, a synergistic effect between both materials was interestingly found. Notably, CaCl2 leads to the shift of the α-xylopyranose/β-xylopyranose anomeric equilibrium, favouring the α-anomer, which in turn benefits the dehydration process. Additionally, γ-Al2O3 was found to promote furfural production;198 Zn doped CuO nanoparticles,199 synthesized by employing sonochemical methods, and niobium-based nanomaterials have also been used.200 In this regard, Bossola et al. have reported xylose dehydration promoted by niobia–titania heterogeneous systems under continuous flow conditions. Moderate reaction parameters were employed.200 Furfural production from xylose has also been attempted by employing Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs). Such emerging catalytic materials were integrated into a membrane reactor in order to achieve in situ furfural separation via a vapor permeation process, displaying improved furfural yield results, in comparison with conventional reactors.43,201,202 Studies on the application of MOFs as catalytic materials for biomass valorization reactions constitute a novel and challenging topic, that still demands a lot of efforts from the scientific community.
Zeolite based-materials have been widely adopted in promoting the before mentioned reactions.167,203–205 Particularly, by combining the Sn-beta zeolite with a Brønsted acid catalyst, the furfural synthesis from xylose could be achieved in aqueous solution under moderate temperature conditions.171 As well, the same catalytic systems have been reported to work in the conversion of different carbohydrates (including glucose, cellobiose and starch) to HMF. It is worth highlighting that, under acid conditions and in saturated aqueous salt solutions, the Sn-beta zeolite is able to transform glucose to fructose, that further facilitates the conversion of aforementioned carbohydrates to HMF.206 In this sense, the concept of “tandem reaction” (involving both glucose isomerization and subsequent fructose dehydration) has been evaluated by He et al. by using a bifunctional catalytic material based on the aminosilane-grafted SiO2–ZrO2 polyamide-imide hollow fibers. Outstandingly, this reaction was also performed under a continuous flow regime.207
Furthermore, glucose dehydration into HMF has been performed by employing a mixture of water and γ-valerolactone, as a green and renewable alternative solvent, in the presence of an aluminium-modified p-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid resin catalyst.208 GVL has been successfully used for the simultaneous preparation of FUR and HMF,209 since it enhances the reactivity of pentose and, in the case of FUR, it inhibits further decomposition reactions. GVL has been employed also in combination with several solvents for the synthesis of furfural from xylose, arabinose, xylan and corn stalk, displaying remarkable results (Fig. 7).210

HMF production from glucose has been also reported to occur using β-tungsten oxide with improved surface area and Brønsted acidity. Furthermore, the same material can be doped with early transition metals that modify the chemical properties of the catalysts leading to different catalytic performances.211
The above-named reaction also occurs in the presence of a wide range of catalytic systems including also organocatalysts.212,213
Hybrid enzyme and chemo-catalytic processes were also used in the HMF synthesis. The process proceeds through three steps: (1) isomerization of glucose to fructose by using the immobilized glucose isomerase enzyme followed by fructose extraction through an organic phase; (2) extraction of fructose from the organic phase with an ionic liquid and (3) dehydration of fructose to HMF by means of in situ extraction with an organic solvent. On using this protocol, HMF yields higher than 80% have been reached. This approach can be also adopted in the valorization of the corn-stover hydrolysate.214
Furthermore, HMF and FUR synthesis has been performed using both monophasic and biphasic systems. Regarding the biphasic systems, different combinations of water/organic solvents were studied.215 Organic solvents such as 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (a biomass-derived compound with low toxicity) and cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) are widely adopted.216 Although considerable advances have been so far achieved, the search of an optimum biphasic solvent system is still a challenge for the scientific community.
In turn, monophasic systems have mainly included ionic liquids,217 organic solvents and supercritical fluids.218 In the production of HMF from fructose, water-based monophasic systems have several inconveniences, due to the formation of undesired side-products, like levulinic acid and humins.15,219 Therefore, many studies have been carried out using organic solvents. In particular, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) showed, so far, the most promising results.172 However, in this case, the main drawback is HMF separation from DMSO.220,221 Thus, alternative solvents are actually explored including, for instance, tetramethylene sulfone (also known as sulfolane) that results to be the most versatile solvent.222
Ionic liquids could play several roles in HMF and FUR synthesis, since they behave as acidic catalysts in pentose dehydration enhancing, in the case of FUR, the furfural yield.48,223,224 In addition, eutectic solvents were also reported in the synthesis of HMF and FUR. For instance, a system like choline chloride/citric acid can be employed in the production of HMF from glucose, as well as in the enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated wood dust as a feedstock.225 Moreover, several anhydrous and aqueous choline chloride–dicarboxylic acid mixtures were investigated in furfural synthesis from oil palm fronds, in the absence of a catalytic system.226 Research investigations in this sense are an open building site with a lot of new solutions still to be discovered.
Production of HMF has been also carried out by employing high-pressure CO2. The synthesis of HMF from inulin in a CO2 rich medium has been reported. In this case, CO2 reacts with water, generating carbonic acid, and the ensuing protons act as a catalyst. The employment of CO2 is becoming a very attractive option, since it represents a recyclable, sustainable and a low-cost alternative to the use of acid catalysts.227,228
Although less explored, several attempts have been reported related to the use of photocatalysis for FUR and HMF production, employing TiO2 based materials and UV-light irradiation.229–231 The cellulosic biomass waste undergoes a photocatalytic reaction leading to HMF by dehydration of fructose in an acid environment. Nonetheless, optimization of HMF production needs to be accomplished.231 In addition, the furfural synthesis from xylose has also been carried out using a photocatalytic process in the presence of zirconia and titanium-based heterogeneous catalytic materials.229
A summary of the reaction conditions adopted in the catalytic processes described so far concerning the production of furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural is reported in Table 1.

3. Reductive upgrading via catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) processes
The reductive upgrading of FUR and HMF, traditionally carried out in the presence of molecular H2, can be performed by using alternative sources of hydrogen via catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) processes.143–146
Even if the CTH is a very well-known reaction (discovered by Knoevenagel in the early 1900s), its fame is recently growing since it can be applied in the valorization of biomass including reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) processes where organic solvents (mainly C1–C4 alcohols or dioxane) are used as such or in combination with water to separate lignocellulose fractions both in the presence and in the absence of added hydrogen.28–30
Since molecular hydrogen is poorly soluble in water as well as in several organic solvents,232,233 the use of an indirect H-source in CTH reactions ensures several important benefits such as:
– the adoption of milder reaction conditions;
– an increase of the security conditions of biorefinery plants;
– a reduction of infrastructure costs related to the purchase, transport and handling of explosive H2.
Moreover, the minor availability of hydrogen allows achieving higher selectivity in the hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of CO and C–O groups thus reducing, at the same time, costs related to the purification from secondary and undesired products.
Over heterogeneous catalytic systems, besides the hydrogenation of the furan ring, the reductive processes of FUR and HMF involve basically both CO and C–OH groups.
In the absence of added hydrogen, two main mechanisms may generally occur (Fig. 8). One is the direct hydrogen transfer from the donor molecule to the acceptor, assisted by the catalytic surface, with the formation of a six-membered transition state, universally indicated as the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley (MPV) mechanism. In this case, acid–base pair sites play a crucial role in the CTH process with (Lewis) acid sites involved in the coordination of the hydroxyl (donor) and carbonyl (acceptor) groups. At the same time, the base site subtracts the hydrogen of the alcoholic group and promotes the final hydrogen transfer to the acceptor molecules (Fig. 8). Alternatively, the hydrogen of the H-donor molecules can be transferred to the catalyst surface with the consequent formation of metal hydride species that can promote both CO hydrogenation and C–OH hydrogenolysis reactions. This kind of mechanism can occur via both monohydride and dihydride routes. In the first case (monohydride mechanism), only the α-hydrogen atom of the H-donor molecules is transferred to the metal surface. Conversely, in the case of a dihydride mechanism, both the hydrogen of the hydroxyl group and the α-hydrogen atom of the H-donor molecule are transferred to the catalyst surface (Fig. 8).
 Fig. 8  Possible CTH reaction pathways over heterogeneous catalysts: “direct hydrogen transfer” and “indirect hydrogen transfer” mechanisms. 
3.1 CTH promoted by simple aliphatic alcohols as H-donor molecules
Liquid organic molecules can be efficiently employed as green and benign H-donor molecules in these processes.232,233 Short chain aliphatic alcohols are surely the most investigated since they are directly obtainable from biomass (or, at least, most of them), inexpensive, easy to handle and afford relative oxidized products that can be recycled and/or reused.
Secondary alcohols, 2-propanol and 2-butanol in particular, were found to be generally the most efficient H-donors since, with respect to primary alcohols, they are characterized by (i) higher reduction potential as well as (ii) an enhanced stabilization effect of the secondary carbocation formed during the hydride transfer.234
The main drawbacks, when aliphatic alcohols are used, can be the poor commercial value of the relative oxidative products and the presence of self-etherification as side reaction (especially in the presence of an acid catalyst).235,236
A summary of the reductive upgrading processes of FUR and HMF promoted by heterogeneous noble metal catalysts, in the presence of aliphatic alcohols, as H-donor molecules, is reported in Table 2.

Intensive research efforts have been made in the course of the last few years by the research group of Prof. Vlachos.237–242 FUR and HMF can be reduced into 2-MF and DMF, respectively, over the Ru/C catalyst under CTH conditions at temperature as low as 120 °C.237,238 However, higher temperatures (180–200 °C) are necessary in order to maximize the production of 2-MF suppressing the etherification reaction of FA.239 Accordingly, the 2-MF yield can be increased by increasing the polarity of the H-donor/solvent as well as its dehydrogenation activity.239
In the case of FUR, it was demonstrated that the initial hydrogenation reaction (FUR → FA) is slower than the hydrogenolysis process (FA → 2-MF). Furthermore, the catalytic performance of the Ru/C catalyst can be enhanced by adding homogeneous Lewis acids as co-catalysts with lanthanides showing the best performance in terms of both FUR conversion (100%) and FA yield (97%) at 180 °C after 3 hours.240
By using XAFS, XPS and high-resolution TEM analysis, it was demonstrated that both metallic Ru and RuO2 sites are synergic active phases for the catalytic tandem hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of HMF into DMF.241 A combined isotopic labelling and kinetic investigations allowed elucidation of the CTH conversion of FUR into 2-MF over the Ru/RuOx/C catalyst in the presence of 2-propanol-d0 or -d8 as a H-donor in toluene solution.242
The bifunctional nature of Ru/RuOx/C is crucial for an effective conversion of FUR into 2-MF since the hydrogenation of the CO bond proceeds via the MVP mechanism promoted by Lewis acid sites while the hydrogenolytic cleavage of the C–OH bond occurs mainly through a ring-activation mechanism that involves both metal and Lewis acid sites (Fig. 9).
 Fig. 9  Schematic representation of the CTH conversion of FUR into 2-MF over the Ru/RuOx/C catalyst via CO hydrogenation on Lewis acid sites (1st step) and C–OH hydrogenolysis on both Lewis acid and metal sites (2nd step).

Other supports (multiwall carbon nanotubes – MWCNTs, hydrotalcites, Co3O4, spinnel ferrites – NiFe2O4) can be efficiently adopted to support Ru in the CTH of FUR and HMF.243–246 Coprecipitated Fe2O3-supported Cu, Ni and Pd catalysts were used by Scholz et al. in the CTH upgrading of FUR and HMF using 2-propanol as the H-donor with the Pd/Fe2O3 system giving the best results under batch and continuous flow conditions.247 The coprecipitated Pd/Fe2O3 catalyst has been largely investigated by numerous research groups showing excellent performances in the CTH of several lignocellulosic derived compounds including polyols and aromatic ethers/esters as a consequence of the strong metal–support interaction and the well dispersed Pd nanoparticles (1–2 nm).248–251
When N-doped porous carbon is used as a support for palladium nanoparticles (2–4 nm) a high FUR conversion (97%) and FAL yield (92%) can be obtained using 2-BuOH as a solvent/H-donor, due to the synergistic effect of nitrogen species and palladium sites on the carbon network.252
By modifying the palladium ratio in bimetallic Cu–Pd/ZrO2 catalysts, it is possible to drive the selectivity towards 2-MF (lower Pd content) or 2-MTHF (higher Pd content).253
The ability of palladium in hydrogenating the furan ring was confirmed by Bhogeswararao and Srinivas, who compared the activity of Pd/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 in the CTH of FUR.254 The Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was found to be very selective in the hydrogenation of the CO bond, while at higher reaction temperatures (240 °C), Pd/Al2O3 allows furan formation in good yield (85%).254
Non-noble metal catalysts have been proved to be a valid alternative to analogous noble metal-based systems in the CTH of FUR and HMF (Table 3). Their use in the valorization of biomass and biomass-derived molecules is of foremost importance due to their relatively high availability, reduced costs and lower environmental impact.

Heterogeneous Cu-based catalysts have been widely adopted255–263 considering also their well known lower ability, when compared with that of noble metal catalysts, in the hydrogenation of the CC bond264,265 thus allowing to preserve the furan ring. Cu nanoparticles supported on activated carbon (AC) can promote the transfer hydrogenation of FUR to FAL.255,256 If the sulfonate group (–SO3H) is grafted on AC, an enhanced CTH ability is registered together with good reuse/recycle properties.256 Cu–Al hydrotalcite systems were found to be very efficient in the reductive upgrading of FUR and HMF using methanol.257,258 In such catalytic systems, Zhang and Chen demonstrated that, in the presence of MeOH as a H-donor, Cu2+ species can efficiently promote the hydrogenation of the CO group of FUR giving FAL in high yield (94,0%). On the other hand, upon reduction with H2/N2 at 500 °C, Cu metallic sites favour the conversion of FUR into 2-MF (94.1% yield) via two consecutive transfer hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis reactions.257 Analogous catalytic systems were used, under continuous flow conditions, using 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO) as a H-donor with the CTH reaction products that can be tuned by varying the residence time.259 The use of 1,4-BDO (now obtainable from fermentation of biomass)266 in CTH reactions is very interesting since its oxidative process releases two equivalents of H2 allowing, at the same time, the formation of the added-value γ-butyrolactone.256 Copper nanoparticles supported on bifunctional MgO–Al2O3 and MgAl2O4 supports show a good catalytic performance in the CTH of FUR and HMF; however a good balance of Cu loading and Lewis acidity of the support is necessary in order to drive the selectivity to the desired CTH products.257–259
NiO nanoparticles were efficiently adopted by the research group of Prof. Riisager in the CTH of FUR and HMF under relatively mild CTH conditions (120–150 °C, 3 hours of reaction time). A reaction pathway was proposed assuming a MPV reduction mechanism facilitated by acidic (Ni2+) and basic (O2−) sites (Fig. 10).267,268 Moreover, a gram-scale FAL production under CTH conditions was validated over 3D nano-/micrometer-scaled NiO nanoparticles. Good results in terms of both catalytic activity and catalyst recyclability were obtained.268

Comparative batch vs continuous flow studies on the CTH of furfural over Ni/AC and Ni–W/AC catalysts were carried out by Luque and co-workers.269,270 Ni/AC shows a good performance (in terms of 2-MF selectivity) under batch conditions.269 A change in product selectivity from 2-MF to FAL, upon catalyst re-utilization, was observed suggesting that – in analogy with copper based catalysts257 – Ni2+ species promote the transfer hydrogenation reaction of the CO group while metallic Ni sites are effective also in the transfer hydrogenolysis of the C–OH bond. The performance of the Ni/AC system, under continuous flow conditions, can be enhanced by adding tungsten as a co-catalyst.270 The Ni–W/AC catalyst performs better than the analogous monometallic Ni/AC in terms of 2-MF selectivity even if lower stability is observed.270 Accordingly, the activity of Ni/AC in the CTH of FUR can be increased by doping the activated carbon support with –N or –SO3H groups.271,272
Other Ni-based bimetallic systems have been successfully used.273–275 The CTH performance of the RANEY®-Ni catalyst is strongly influenced upon the addition of a second additive.274 In particular, the addition of acetone (the oxidation product of 2-propanol) promotes carboxylation and furan ring hydrogenation reactions.273
Bimetallic Ni–Cu276,277 and Ni–Fe246,247 systems have shown interesting results in the CTH of FUR and HMF with the latter being of particular interest since it can be easily recovered magnetically from the reaction media.
While Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 have been used as efficient supports in promoting transfer hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis reactions,247–251 Fe-based catalysts have found limited applications in the CTH of FUR and HMF.278–281 FeVO4 was found to be a valid catalyst in the vapour-phase conversion of FUR into 2-MF (80% yield at 320 °C) using MeOH as a solvent/H-donor.280 The study of the CTH products allowed also to clarify the overall reaction pathways, and the key role of the in situ generated formaldehyde in driving the hydrogenation process as well as the hydroxyalkylation reaction of MF to 2-DMF was demonstrated (Fig. 11).280
 Fig. 11  Proposed reaction pathways for the CTH of FUR promoted by the FeVO4 catalyst in the presence of MeOH as a H-donor. Reproduced from ref. 280 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry, copyright 2017. 
Also cobalt-based catalysts have been poorly investigated even if, when used, very interesting CTH performances were reported.282,283 Co3O4 nanoparticles (3 nm) supported on mesoporous carbon can efficiently promote the transfer hydrogenation of several α,β-unsaturated aldehydes under low temperature conditions (120 °C) with excellent results in the CTH of FUR and HMF.282 Furthermore, a gram-scale experiment was successfully carried out (160 °C, 4 h reaction time, 2-PrOH as a solvent/H-donor) with a complete conversion of FUR (100%) and 97% selectivity to FAL.282 Good results were also obtained in the CTH of FUR to FAL (74% yield) over a Co3O4–Al2O3 hydrotalcite-derived catalyst.283
Commercial alumina (γ-Al2O3) and alumina–carbon composite catalysts (Al2O3–S) represent an inexpensive solution for the promotion of the transfer hydrogenation of FUR via a MPV reaction mechanism.284,285 However, it was shown that the presence of water in the reaction medium causes the transformation of CTH-active Lewis acid sites into the Brønsted ones, thus poisoning the catalytic systems.284
Alkaline earth oxide catalysts have been largely adopted in both batch and continuous conditions.286–292 Particular attention has been paid to the use of MgO catalysts, with some significant contributions coming from the research group of Prof. Cavani.288–290 By using MeOH as a H-donor, a pure MgO catalyst is able to reduce FUR into FAL at a low reaction temperature (below 350 °C). Upon increasing the reaction temperature, the formation of 2-MF, associated with the partial rearrangement of the furan ring into cyclopentanones, was observed.288 Interestingly, in the presence of Fe as a co-catalyst, an increase of the Lewis acidity of the system driving the product selectivity to 2-MF is observed, independent of the reaction temperature adopted.288,289,291 Accordingly, the incorporation of Al into MgO was found to enhance, together with the CTH process, the aldolization of FUR into C8 products.292
Among all non-noble metal catalytic systems employed for the transfer hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of biobased furans, zirconia-based catalysts are surely the most widely investigated. The reasons, beyond the research efforts, are related to the synergistic effect between the base and Lewis acid sites that positively promotes an efficient MPV reduction on the ZrO2 surface.293
A vast selection of zirconium-based catalysts have been synthesized, through several preparation methods, for the reductive conversion of FUR and HMF into FAL and DHMF, respectively.294–304 Excellent FAL yields were obtained by using ZrO2294 and Zr(OH)4295 systems as well as zirconium based catalysts prepared by using humic acids (directly extracted from lignite) as a template.296 Right modification of the zirconium surface on adding phosphates,297 heteropoly acids,298 thiophene- and furan-dicarboxylate299,300 can strengthen the interaction of acid and basic sites of the catalysts enhancing the conversion of FUR into FAL. Good results were also obtained starting from HMF with 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF) being the main reaction product by using both ethanol and 2-propanol as the solvent/H-donor.301–303 Addition of Fe304 and BaO305 increases the total amount of Lewis sites. In particular, in the presence of BaO, the Brønsted acid activity of the Zr-SBA catalyst becomes negligible.305
Interestingly, the analogous Zr-SBA-15 catalyst was found to promote the combined transfer hydrogenation and alcoholysis of FUR into alkyl-levulinates in the presence of MeOH306 or 2-PrOH307 as a solvent. Other single-state processes, concerning the direct conversion of FUR into alkyl-levulinates, promoted by bimetallic Zr–Al308 and Nb2O5–ZrO2309 systems, have been proposed. In all these works, the synergistic role played by both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, with the latter being the active catalytic center in promoting the ring opening reaction, was highlighted.310 Furthermore, the presence of heteropoly tungstate311 and banzylphosphonate groups312 can further push the conversion of FUR and HMF into γ-valerolactone (GVL), which is another important bioderived molecule, generally obtained via a hydrogenation process of levulinic acid or its esters,313–316 with innumerable applications as a biofuel, green solvent, food additive, and building block for the production of bio-based polymers.317
The possibility to opportunely tune the interaction of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites in heterogeneous zeolites and metal–organic frameworks makes these systems very interesting heterogeneous catalysts for the cascade conversion of bioderived furans into GVL.318–320 Román-Leshkov and Corma proposed a reaction pathway for the conversion of FUR to GVL by using 2-butanol as a H-donor molecule and an alcoholysis agent in which Lewis acid sites are responsible for CTH processes while the intramolecular C–O bond cleavage is promoted by Brønsted acid sites (Fig. 12).318,319

Finally, Lewis acid zeolites have been efficiently used for the tandem transfer hydrogenation and etherification reactions concerning the transformation of HMF into fuel additives under batch321 and continuous flow322 conditions.
3.2 CTH promoted by other H-donor molecules
Besides aliphatic alcohols, other H-donor molecules have been investigated in the CTH of FUR and HMF, with formic acid and silanes being the most used (Table 4).323–340

Formic acid can be a sustainable H-donor system because it is an easy product from biomass-derived carbohydrates and, most importantly, CO2 is formed as a unique side product.341,342
Monometallic and bimetallic palladium-based catalysts are surely widely adopted in promoting the CTH reactions of FUR and HMF by using formic acid as a H-donor.323–326
In the presence of formic acid, the reductive conversion of FUR and HMF allows the production, in good yield, of 2-methyl furan (2-MF) and dimethyl furan (DMF). The research group of T. B. Rauchfuss demonstrated that, upon addition of a small amount of H2SO4, the reaction pathway to DMF promoted by Pd/C using formic acid as a reagent implies (i) the formation of BHMF as the reaction intermediate and, most importantly, (ii) the esterification of the OH group and the subsequent CO2 removal (Fig. 13).323,324 Moreover, the presence of CO2 in the reaction media suppress the hydrogenation of the furan ring. A similar reaction pathway was proposed by Tao et al. for the CTH of HMF over Au–Pd/C in a very interesting report on the integrated conversion of HMF and ethylene glycol (EG) to p-xylene.325
 Fig. 13  Reaction pathway for the CTH conversion of FUR and HMF promoted by the Pd/C catalyst in the presence of formic acid as a H-donor and H2SO4 as a promoter. 
On the other hand, when zirconium phosphate was used to support palladium nanoparticles (Pd/ZrP), the direct formation of 1,6-hexanediol from HMF, via hydrogenolytic ring opening promoted by Brønsted acid sites of the support, was obtained.326
Physically mixed CuO–Pd/C catalysts can efficiently promote the preparation of FA from FUR by using formic acid as a H-donor molecule.327 Furthermore, a synergistic effect of the CuPd alloy (formed upon in situ reduction) in promoting FUR conversion and of Cu nanoparticles in enhancing product selectivity was emphasized.327
Monometallic cobalt particles supported on mesoporous N-doped carbon (Co–N–C) and bimetallic Ni–Co/C catalysts were found to be very efficient in the CTH of FUR and HMF, respectively.328,329 The Co–N–C system shows, in the presence of formic acid, a superior performance than commercial Pd-, Pt- and Ru catalysts affording FA in an almost quantitative yield (99%).328 The presence of formic acid as a H-donor is crucial for obtaining high yields of FA: analogous reactions carried out in the presence of molecular H2 as a direct reductive agent proceeded to give a lower FUR conversion and the product mixture included furan and ring hydrogenated compounds.328
Nickel was found to be a valid co-catalyst in the CTH of furan derivatives promoted by Co and Cu based systems.329–332 The bimetallic Ni–Co catalyst allows a good production of 2-MF from FUR (90% yield) with 5-methyl-furan being the key intermediate.329 An analogous yield of 2-MF (92%) can be also obtained over the Ni–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst in the presence of both formic acid and 2-propanol, with the latter which can contribute to the overall CTH process favouring the reduction of the carbonyl group of furfural.332 On the other hand, monometallic Cu nanoparticles, supported on MgAl2O4 (MA), characterized by acid–base properties and a strong metal support interaction, can promote the transfer hydrogenation of FUR into FA with good results in terms of catalyst stability and reuse.333
Finally, in the presence of formic acid, the embedded Rh/ED-KIT-6 catalyst shows a better performance in the CTH of FUR to FA with respect to analogous Ru, Pd and Ni systems.334 The superior catalytic activity of the Rh/ED-KIT-6 system was attributed to the cooperative effect of the nitrogen functionality and the ultra-small Ru nanoparticles (1.2 nm).334
Interesting results were also obtained in the presence of polymethylhydroxysiloxane (PMHS), an inexpensive coproduct of the silicone industry which is considered to be a sustainable H-donor molecule being non-toxic and water/air insensitive.335–337 By using a commercial Pd/C catalyst, starting from FUR, it is possible to obtain four different added value products (formic acid, 2-methylfuran, 5-hydroxy-2-pentanone and n-butyl levulinate) in high yield (≥90%) by simply controlling the reaction conditions adopted (water doping content, acid type, reaction temperature and H-donor dosage).336 Accordingly, under mild reaction conditions (80 °C, 6 h), also Cs2CO3 is able to convert FUR into FAL with H3SiMe being the key hydride species formed in situ by activation of PMHS in the presence of carbonate species.337
Only few other molecules have been investigated as H-donors for the reductive upgrading of FUR and HMF.338–340 In this regard, the surface defect of Ru–Co/C catalysts can efficiently promote the chemisorption of the CO group of FUR (and of other carbonyl compounds) favouring the H-transfer from benzyl-alcohol.338
4. Electrocatalytic conversion
In the last decade, we have witnessed a significant advancement of electrocatalysis applications in the sustainable transformation of biomass derived molecules.343–349 There are several reasons behind this growing attention, including
– the use of renewable energy sources (i.e., solar, eolic, hydropower) instead of stoichiometric amounts of oxidizers or reducing agents;
– mild operating temperature (typically below 100 °C) and pressure conditions;
– the absence of high cost and hazardous molecular H2 (water can be efficiently used as a proton source);
– the possibility to drive the chemo-selectivity of redox reactions by opportunely tuning the electrochemical parameters;
– an easy control of the degree of the reaction progress by using simple and quick analytical techniques (e.g. cyclic voltammetry).
A schematic representation of electrocatalytic devices (in alkaline electrolytes) is represented in Fig. 14.
 Fig. 14  Schematic representation of electrocatalytic devices in alkaline electrolytes. 
The electrocatalytic valorization of FUR and HMF can embrace both reductive and oxidative processes (Fig. 15) that are generally conducted in fuel cells and electrolysers.343,344
 Fig. 15  Simplified electro-reduction and electro-oxidation processes of furfural and HMF. ΔrG0 is the Gibbs free energy according to ref. 345 and 346. 
Electro-reductive (ER) processes include hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions that involve energy and hydrogen consumption. The hydrogen necessary for the electro-reduction process (also known as Electro Catalytic Hydrogenation – ECH) of FUR and HMF is generated on the surface of the electrode under both acidic (1) and neutral/alkaline (2) conditions: H3O+ + e− ⇆ Hads + H2O(1) H2O + e− ⇆ Hads + OH−(2)In this regard, it is worth underlining the necessary control of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that consumes Hads reducing the faradaic efficiency of the overall process: 2Hads ⇆ H2(3) Hads + H3O+ + e− ⇆ H2 + H2O(4)The Gibbs free energy for the reductive conversion of FUR and HMF and the standard cell potentials were reported, respectively, by Huber and Verevkin (Fig. 15).343,344
Since the electro-reduction processes are performed either at a constant cathode potential as well as at a constant current density, an optimal condition needs to be found in order to maximize the adsorption of both furans and Hads on the catalyst/electrode surface and to drive the hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis process.345–347
The electrocatalytic reduction of furfural allows the production, among others, of furfuryl alcohol (FAL) and 2-methylfuran (2-MF), while 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF) and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) are the main reaction products starting from HMF.348
These hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis processes are generally coupled with oxygen evolution reactions (OER) or other electro-oxidative (EO) processes of biomass derived chemicals.
EO of biomass derived compounds gained a lot of attention since the oxidation of water is kinetically unfavored and its product (O2) is not of significant value.349 With respect to furanics, the electro-oxidation of FUR permits the production of furoic acid (FA) as the only possible reaction product, while HMF can be efficiently used as a starting substrate for the sustainable production of several important chemicals such as 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF), 5-formyl-furan carboxylic acid (FFCA), 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furan carboxylic acid (HMFCA) and 2,5-furan dicarboxylic acid (FDCA).
4.1 Electro-reduction reactions
The chemical nature of the cathodic catalyst has a deep impact on both EO efficiency and product selectivity.
Cathode materials based on copper are by far the most investigated systems in the electro-reduction of furfural and HMF.350–359 The reason can be explained taking into consideration that copper (together with Fe, Ni, Ag and Pb) is characterized by a medium/high HER onset potential thus allowing a higher production of hydrogenated compounds.147
Under basic conditions, Cu cathodes can effectively promote the transformation of furfural into furfuryl alcohol showing, at the same time, higher FUR conversion and a superior current efficiency when compared with analogous C, Fe, Ni, Pb, Pt and Ti systems.350–353 In contrast, under (strong) acidic conditions, copper can catalyze the production of 2-MF; however, a decrease of the cathodic current is observed by increasing the FUR concentration.354,358 Recently, Biddinger and co-workers demonstrated that also the structural order of the electrode has a deep impact on the electrochemical hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of FUR: microcrystalline and nanocrystalline Cu systems present an enhanced activity in the production of FAL and 2-MF, when compared with analogous standard Cu cathodes.357
Ni, Fe and Pt were found to be good catalysts for the formation of FOL under acidic conditions. However, when platinum was used as a cathodic material, poor current efficiencies were registered as a result of the well-known ability of Pt-group metals (PGM) in promoting hydrogen evolution reactions.353,354
Among PGM, Pd/C shows a much higher activity (4.4 times) and current efficiency (50 times) than the Pt/C catalyst in the hydrogenation of FUR carried out in an electrocatalytic membrane reactor (equipped with a PEM fuel cell) at a power input of 0.1 W.343 The conversion of FUR can be pushed up by increasing the power input, while an increase of the reactor temperature as well as the direct use of hydrogen at the anode has less effects.343
On the other hand, addition of a co-metal has a positive effect on the ECH performance with the lanthanum trivalent ion doped nano-TiO2 film electrode exhibiting higher electrocatalytic activity in the reductive upgrading of furfural than the undoped nano-TiO2 electrode.360
The surface area of the electrode has a deep impact on the electrocatalytic conversion of FUR. Its conversion, in fact, increases from 5% to 80% when Pt is supported on activated carbon fibers (surface area = 1863 m2 g−1) as a result of an increased coverage of Hads on the electrocatalytic surface.361
Accordingly, an increase of the substrate concentration increases the coverage on the catalytic surface thus positively influencing the ECH process and lowering, at the same time, the HER reaction.352,354 For example, Chadderdon et al. demonstrated that an increase of the reductive faradaic efficiency is observed, together with a concurrent decrease of the HER efficiency, when passing from 0.01 to 0.1 M FUR concentration.350 Nigel and Schröder confirmed that, on using a copper electrode, the increase of the furfural concentration causes a decrease of the cathodic current; however, an opposite behaviour was registered on using a lead electrode.354
Basic, neutral and mildly acidic electrolytes favour the conversion of FUR into FAL, while strong acid solutions tend to promote also the formation of 2-MF.354,355,362 From a mechanistic point of view, it is worth underlining that, in contrast with classic batch processes where FUR is firstly converted into furfuryl alcohol that (in a successive reaction) can be further reduced to 2-methylfuran, FAL and 2-MF are generated in parallel under electrochemical conditions.352,362 DFT calculations on Ag, Pb, and Ni single crystals, as electrocatalysts for furfural reduction, confirm that partially hydrogenated intermediates can also undergo C–O hydrogenolysis, having a reduced energy barrier (with respect to the direct C–O bond cleavage of FUR), revealing also potential paths for parallel production of FAL and 2-MF.363
Interestingly, FUR can be used in both electrolytic chambers allowing the simultaneous formation of furoic acid (at the anode) and furfuryl alcohol (at the cathode).350,351,358 In this regard, recently, a two-electrode catalytic system based on Cu3P nanosheets and granular Ni2P nanocrystals supported on commercial carbon fiber cloth (CFC) afforded a complete FUR conversion with almost 100% FAL (faradaic efficiency = 92.0–98.0% over the applied potential range of −0.05 to −0.55 V) and FA (faradaic efficiency = 90.0–98.0% at an applied potential of 1.2–1.7 V vs. RHE) selectivity (Fig. 16).

The product distribution in the electrocatalytic hydrogenation reduction of HMF is also influenced by the nature of the cathode and pH conditions.364 The electro-reduction of HMF is not strongly catalyst-dependent since all investigated cathodes are characterized by an analogous onset potential (−0.5 ± 0.2 V). However, under neutral conditions (0.1 M Na2SO4) Fe, Ni, Ag, Zn and Cd allow the production of DHMF while hydrogenolysis derived products were detected in the presence of Co, Au, Cu, Sn and Sb. Moreover, the product selectivity can be tuned over Pd, Al, Bi and Pb catalysts by controlling the applied potential. On the other hand, acidic conditions (0.5 M H2SO4) lower the activation energy for the reductive upgrading of HMF on using several investigated metal catalysts, which can be divided into three groups: metals mainly forming DHMF (Fe, Ni, Cu, and Pb) or DMDHF (Pd, Pt, Al, Zn, In, and Sb) or DHMF and DMDHF (2,5-dimethyl-2,3-dihydrofuran) depending on the applied potential (Co, Ag, Au, Cd, Sb, and Bi).365 The onset potentials of EO and HER are positively shifted in acidic solutions with respect to those measured in neutral conditions with Pd showing the most marked pH dependence.
A strong dependence on pH was also demonstrated by Royalance and Choi in the conversion of HMF to 2,5-hexanedione (HD) over a Zn cathode.366 The etheric C–O bond hydrogenolysis of the furan ring was found to be an acid catalyzed process with product selectivity that shifts from 2,5-hexanedione (HD) to DHMF when passing from an acid solution (pH = 2) to a neutral one (pH = 7.2). Moreover, a reverse effect, upon increasing the acidity of the reaction solution, was also observed. By combining the Clemmensen reduction and a ring-opening mechanism, a predictive model for the reduction of 5-MF (the key reaction intermediate) to HD on the Zn surface (Fig. 17) was suggested.366
 Fig. 17  Electro-reduction of 5-MF to HD via a combined Clemmensen reduction and ring-opening mechanism. Reproduced from ref. 366 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry, copyright 2016. 
Despite the various attempts made so far, it is not easy to elucidate the mechanism of HMF hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis under electrochemical conditions since the hydrogen necessary for the reductive process may arise from Hads as well as from water (neutral conditions) or H3O+ species (acidic conditions): HMF + 2Hads ⇆ DHMF + 2Hads(5) HMF + 2H2O + 2e− ⇆ DHMF + 2OH−(6) HMF + 2H3O+ + 2e− ⇆ DHMF(7)However, in the case of Pb, the mechanism by which hydrogen arises from Hads should be discarded since the onset potential of HER is about 600 mV lower than that of HMF hydrogenation.365
From a systematic investigation of the HMF reduction, on the Ag electrode surface at various applied potentials, Choi and co-workers suggest that, in the potential region of −1.0 V ≥ E > −1.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the reduction mechanism of HMF does not involve Hads while in the region −1.1 V ≥ E > −1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl the formation of surface-adsorbed hydrogen atoms is a necessary prerequisite for the formation of DHMF.366 Once DHMF is formed, it is not significantly reduced over Ag, Cu Pb and Sn metals under neutral conditions, while it can be converted into MFA and DHMF only under acidic conditions.364,365
4.2 Electro-oxidation reactions
The electro-oxidation of furans generally requires metallic and bimetallic catalysts based on Au, Ni, Pd and Pt.
The electrochemical conversion of FUR into FA was less investigated in comparison with oxidative reactions of HMF; however, in the last few years, there have been some important contributions which need to be highlighted.351,367–369,373
In one of the first reports, Belgsir investigated the EO of FUR on noble (Au and Pt) and non-noble (Pb, Cu and Ni) metal electrodes.351 Furfural is weakly oxidized on Au (20% conversion); however, high selectivity to FA was registered (95%). The best FA yield was obtained on nickel anodes in a strong alkaline medium (0.5 M NaOH – 0.8 mA cm−2). The same research group presented probably the first example of the concurrent electrochemical production of furoic acid and furfuryl alcohol from furfural on modified graphite felt electrodes under controlled current in a divided flow cell.350 The electro-oxidation was also performed on a Ni anode (nickel modified graphite felt anodes – NiGF) and a complete conversion of FUR was achieved in a phosphate buffer (H3PO4 + NaOH, pH = 6.6) with FA obtained up to 95% yield at an appropriate flow rate (2.5 mL min−1). However, when the FUR reduction was paired, a lower yield of FOL was registered.
A density functional theory study concerning the electrochemical oxidation of FUR on the anodic Pt(111) surface was also published.367 After comparing possible furfural oxidation paths leading to furoic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, and maleic anhydride, the authors concluded that the electro-oxidation of FUR preferentially proceeds to FA as a result of the high energy required for C–C bond breaking. Most importantly, DFT analysis of elementary steps, regarding both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects, suggests that the product selectivity in the EO of FUR can be tuned by varying the electrode potential.367
Romań et al. utilized differential reactor studies with online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OLEMS) and in situ infrared spectroscopy attenuated total reflectance-surface-enhanced infrared reflection–absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) to elucidate the electro-oxidation pathways of FUR on platinum catalysts in the presence of an acidic electrolyte confirming that the product selectivity is potential-dependent.368 At low potential (below 1.2 VRHE), FA and 5-hydroxyfuroic acid are the primary products, while at higher potentials, the selectivity shifts toward 5-hydroxy-furan-2(5H)-one (HFN) and maleic acid (MA) (Fig. 18).

Recently, MA was obtained in a relatively good yield (65%) by Kubota and Choi in an aqueous medium under ambient temperature and pressure over the PbO2 catalyst without the use of oxidizing agents.369 The key driving factor is the presence of acidic media that promote furan ring opening during the electro-oxidation, which proceeds via 2-furanol as the reaction intermediate.
Another important reaction product in the EO of FUR is surely 5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (HFO), which is an important bioactive intermediate compound.
Metal chalcogenides were found to be simple and efficient electrocatalysts in the electrocatalytic transformation of FUR into HFO in the presence of the [[Et3NH]NO3–MeCN–H2O] anolyte with H2O being the oxygen-source.370–373 CuS nanosheets, used as electrocatalysts, show the best catalytic performance providing a good HFO yield (58.7%) presenting, at the same time, long-term stability. Furfural electro-oxidation into HFO proceeds via multistep reactions, including C–C cleavage, subsequent ring opening/oxidation, and intramolecular isomerization (Fig. 19).373
 Fig. 19  Reaction mechanism relative to the electrochemical oxidation of FUR to HFO over the CuS/CP electrode. Reproduced from ref. 373 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry, copyright 2019. 
The electro-oxidation of HMF, in alkaline media, over supported Au, Pd and Au–Pd nanoparticles has been proved to be dependent on the chemical nature of the anode and on the applied potential.374 The Au/C catalyst was found to be very active in the HMF oxidation to 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) with 98% selectivity on using a potential from 0.6 to 0.9 V. By increasing the electrode potential, HFCA can be further oxidized to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). In contrast, the oxidation of HMF, on the Pd/C catalyst, follows two competitive routes strictly related to the applied electrode potential. Interestingly, Pd–Au bimetallic catalysts allow the formation of FFCA and FDCA at lower potentials than monometallic systems with a product distribution clearly dependent on the Pd/Au ratio and the anode potential.374
The Au/TiO2 catalyst shows a better electrocatalytic activity than Pt/C, Pd/C, Ru/C and Rh/C anodes under strong basic conditions with pH 13 being the maximum pH value where HMF is stable for EO and does not degrade into humin type products.375 On the Pt surface, the alcoholic group oxidizes faster than the aldehydic functionality under neutral/acid conditions, whereas at higher pH values, the alcohol EO appears to be the rate-limiting step.
The Pt anode allows the production of FFC (with 100% selectivity) in a biphasic medium (H2O/CH2Cl2).376 FFC can be obtained, in high yield (80%), also with a Pb-modified Pt electrode starting from DHMF in a basic solution (0.1 M NaOH), applying a potential of 0.9 V vs. RHE for 10 s followed by a regeneration-pulse of 1.9 V for 2 s.377 The introduction of Fe3O4 increases the reaction rate when Pt on graphene oxide (Pt/Fe3O4/rGO) is used in the oxidation of HMF into FDCA (100% conversion and 98% yield after 8 h in a 0.05 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution).378 The Pt/Fe3O4/rGO catalyst can be reused up to 5 times without a significant loss of activity and, most importantly, can be easily recovered magnetically.
In a very elegant contribution, it was proved that if the EO of HMF is promoted by manganese oxide in acidic media, FDCA can be easily separated by spontaneous precipitation without varying the pH of the reaction solution.379
Since the first report of Grabowski et al., the use of monometallic and bimetallic nickel-based anodes for the EO of HMF has attracted a lot of attention.380–387 FDCA was obtained (90% yield with a faradaic efficiency of about 80%) in a continuous electrochemical process with integrated product separation by using a Ni/NiOOH foam anode.381
A Ni foam modified with NixB was able to produce FDCA in an almost quantitative yield (98.5%) with a faradaic efficiency close to 100% using also the in situ ATR-IR analysis, revealing that HMF is preferentially electro-oxidized to FDCA.382
Other bimetallic Ni systems (3D Ni2P nanoparticle array, NiSe@NiOx and Ni3N@C) were found to be very efficient electrodes not only for the EO of HMF but also for the HER.383–385 Huber presented bimetallic NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets grown on a carbon fiber paper that allow HMF oxidation at a higher rate than that of water thus being a cheap earth-abundant anode for alkaline H2 evolution in water splitting cells.386 Also a hierarchically porous Ni3S2/Ni foam was efficiently used as an electrocatalyst for the oxidation of HMF to FDCA with the decoupled H2 generation at the integrated cell voltage reduced by ∼200 mV with respect to that obtained with the pure water splitting.387
Cobalt was found to be a good co-catalyst in the EO of HMF.388,389 In recent papers, the research group of Prof. Cha presented very stable Ni/Co2O4 nano-systems characterized by filament and wire architectures.388 The NiCo2O4 catalyst showed an almost complete conversion of HMF (99.6%) and high FDCA selectivity (90.8%). NixCo3−xO4 catalysts grown vertically on a 3D Ni foam (NF), prepared through a low-temperature hydrothermal method, were efficiently used as electrocatalysts for 5-hydroxymethyl-furfural oxidation with NiCo2O4 nanowires exhibiting the best electrocatalytic performance (100% faradaic efficiency and nearly 90% FDCA yield).389
Cobalt phosphate on a copper foam (Co–P/CF) shows a high electrocatalytic performance in the oxidation of HMF (100% conversion, 90% FDCA yield) under ambient conditions (room temperature, 1 atm) in alkaline media (0.1 M KOH).390
Co–P increases also the performance of bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoelectrodes in promoting the TEMPO-mediated oxidation of HMF with the concurrent suppression of OER. TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) is a non-precious homogeneous catalyst, very well known for being the best mediator in the photo-assisted EO of HMF that can drive the selective production of FDCA (a detailed description of photo-assisted electrocatalytic processes is provided in the next paragraph).349,391,392 In fact, in the presence of TEMPO, HMF is converted into FFCA and FDCA is formed soon after the electrolysis promoted by the Co–P electrocatalyst.391
Interestingly, the selectivity towards oxidation products, facilitated by 4-acetamido-TEMPO in the presence of an inexpensive carbon felt electrode, was found to be insensitive to the anode potential in the combined electrocatalytic hydrogenation and oxidation of HMF.393 In this contribution, an efficient conversion of HMF was presented by pairing reduction and oxidation half-reactions in one paired electrocatalytic cell having the anode (4-acetamido-TEMPO) and the cathode (Ag/C catalyst) and electrolytes separated by an anion-exchange membrane.393
Furthermore, considering that the initial amount of HMF in the cathodic cell was three times greater than that on the anodic one, the stoichiometry of the overall electrocatalytic reaction can be summarized as follows: Anode: HMF + 6OH− → FDCA + 6e− + 4H2O(8) Cathode: 3HMF + 6H2O + 6e− → 3BHMF + 6OH−(9) Overall: 4HMF + 2H2O → FDCA + 3BHMF(10)Fig. 20 shows the yield of redox reactions (%) and the relative electron efficiency (%) of the electrocatalytic HMF conversion to BHMF and FDCA using unpaired and paired cells. The yields and electron efficiencies were very similar to those achieved in separate cells, clearly indicating the applicability of the paired electrocatalytic systems.393

The paired electrocatalytic oxidation and reduction of HMF is also efficiently promoted by vanadium nitride-based electrocatalysts.394 Both reactions show excellent performances with high HMF conversion (above 90%) and selectivity toward FDCA (≥96% with a faradaic efficiency ≥84%) and DHMTHF (≥88% with a faradaic efficiency ≥86%) (Fig. 21).

5. Photocatalytic upgrading
In photocatalytic processes, light-induced electron (e−) and hole (h+) pairs accelerate a redox reaction.155–162 The heterogeneous photocatalysis already represents one of the core sustainable technologies for water and air remediation, artificial photosynthesis (CO2 photoreduction), fine chemical synthesis and many other catalytic applications. Photocatalytic upgrading of lignocellulosic biomass and its derived feedstocks is getting more and more attention since it is generally conducted at standard ambient temperature (25 °C) and pressure (1 atm). The fundamental principles of heterogeneous photocatalysis are well known and imply the photoexcitation (with an energy greater than or equal to the bandgap energy of the semiconductor photocatalysts) of an electron (e−) from the filled valence band (VB) to the empty conduction band (CB) with the consequent formation of a hole vacancy (h+). The electrons on the conduction band are responsible for the reductive processes while oxidation reactions occur on the valence band catalyzed by photoinduced holes (Fig. 22).
 Fig. 22  Mechanism of heterogeneous photocatalysis: photoconductor activation and reductive/oxidative reactions occurring on its surface. 
The oxidation of organic species can be catalyzed either (i) directly by the generated high potential holes or (ii) indirectly by radicals formed on the valence band (for example ˙OH radicals formed from water derived OH− species). Obviously, charge recombination may occur on the photocatalyst surface decreasing the overall efficiency.
TiO2 based materials are the most frequently chosen catalysts; nevertheless, also graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), graphene oxide (GO), zinc oxide (ZnO) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) systems have been efficiently used in a plethora of photocatalytic applications.395–404
5.1 Photo-reduction reactions
Very few contributions are present in the literature on the reductive conversion of FUR and HMF via a photocatalytic route.405–408
3% Pd/SiC was found to be a very efficient catalyst for the selective photohydrogenation of furan derivatives, at room temperature, in a n-amyl alcohol solution under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp (wavelength range: 400–800 nm).405 The higher catalytic activity of Pd/SiC with respect to analogous Pd/SiO2 and Pd/TiO2 systems can be attributed to the Mott–Schottky support–metal contact that facilitates a quick transfer of photo-generated electrons from SiC to Pd nanoparticles. Moreover, a tight correlation between furan conversion and the adopted light intensity (or the chosen wavelength) was observed (Fig. 23).

Photo-oxidative processes of biomass derived furans can be carried out both in the presence and in the absence of molecular O2. If the semiconductor is exposed to air, it is generally accepted that oxygen is reduced to superoxide radicals ˙O2 that act as reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxygen-free conditions generally permit a higher degree of chemo-selectivity; however, their use is sometimes limited by the expensive working conditions necessary for technical applications.147,154
Lignocellulosic biomass-derived compounds can be used as sacrificial agents (electron donors) for the photocatalytic hydrogen production. This catalytic approach is now widely used in photoelectrochemical cells (PEC) and is getting more and more attention since, with respect to classic water-splitting reactions (WSR), it has several important benefits: (i) the production of high value products on the surface of the photo anode (O2 is not of significant importance), (ii) it reduces the voltage input for H2 evolution from water; (iii) it increases the safety and operative-cost effectiveness (the recombination of H2 and O2, in the headspace of an electrolyzer, presents tremendous handling problems requiring costly gas separation apparatus).409–413 However, at the industrial level, such kind of approach may represent an expensive source of H2 due to the cost related to separation/purification of furan derivatives from reaction media thus implying a further co-valorization of H2 (i.e. methanation).414,415
A schematic comparison of a conventional water splitting electrolyzer and a photoelectrocatalytic electrolyzer is represented in Fig. 24.
 Fig. 24  Schematic representation of a conventional water splitting electrolyzer (left) and a photoelectrocatalytic electrolyzer (right). 
At present, to the best of our knowledge, there has been only one contribution concerning the photocatalytic oxidation of FUR. Zhou et al. demonstrated the complete photocatalytic conversion of FUR into 2-furanoic acid (FA) in the presence of Au nanoparticles supported on TiO2, under both ultraviolet and visible-light conditions, using air as an oxidant at ambient temperature, in the presence of Na2CO3 that acts as a visible-light oxidation promoter as well as a ROS inhibitor under UV light.397 Kinetic experiments demonstrated that the aldehyde group of HMF is preferentially photo-oxidized rather than the hydroxyl group and that furfuryl alcohol can be efficiently oxidized into foric acid via the formation of furfural as the reaction intermediate.416,417
The introduction of a metal generally enhances the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 in the oxidation of furan derivatives; however, unselective reactions as well as mineralization processes are also observed.418,419 Palmisano and co-workers investigated the effect of the crystalline phase of commercial and home-prepared anatase, rutile, and brookite TiO2 nanoparticles on the photocatalytic oxidation of HMF to FDC.420 It was demonstrated that a high surface area and low crystallinity cause higher FDC selectivity with a concurrent decrease of the photocatalytic activity as a consequence of an extensive degree of electron–hole recombination.
HMF was largely investigated with heterogeneous catalysts based on g-C3N4.421–427 The metal-free g-C3N4 catalyst (prepared through a simple calcination of melamine) was efficiently used in the conversion of HMF into 2,5-diformylfuran(DFF) under visible light irradiation.421 Reactions were performed in the presence of molecular oxygen that was found to play a key role in the photooxidation process, being the source of superoxide radicals that act as dominant active species (Fig. 25).

Accordingly, the occurrence of a solvent effect was demonstrated using the apolar benzotrifluoride (PhCF3) that allows higher HMF conversions as a result of its superior ability to dissolve O2. On the other hand, the addition of polar solvents lowers HMF conversion increasing, at the same time, the selectivity towards DFF.421
Thermally exfoliated g-C3N4 with a high surface area (154 m2 g−1) shows higher conversion and FDC selectivity with respect to analogous g-C3N4 samples.422 Most importantly, exfoliated carbon nitrite materials can be applied in real-life conditions since photocatalytic tests, carried out under natural solar irradiation, result in higher FDC yields when compared to those performed in the laboratory. It is worth underlining that not all preparative methodologies of nanostructured carbon nitrite materials can improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4.423 The thermal exfoliation treatment shows a superior photocatalytic performance than chemical ultrasonic irradiation, ball milling and hydrothermal treatments under both artificial and solar light irradiation.423
By preparing a polymeric carbon nitride–hydrogen peroxide adduct (PCN–H2O2),424,425 good thermal stability up to 200 °C (in an aqueous suspension under UV and solar irradiation) and also discrete FDC selectivity due to the presence of H2O2, which creates a steric hindrance for HMF with the amino group limiting unselective oxidation processes, were observed.
By doping g-C3N4 with WO3, a reduction of charge recombination was observed with a consequent increase of the catalytic activity in the photo-assisted conversion of HMF to DFF.426 The dispersion of cobalt thioporphyrazine on g-C3N4 (CoPz/g-C3N4) allows obtaining an excellent catalytic activity in the photo-oxidation of HMF into FDC under simulated sunlight, using air as a benign oxidant at pH = 9.18.427 CoPz/g-C3N4 can be reused up to five times with only negligible change in both HMF conversion and FDC selectivity. On the other hand, under the adopted reaction condition, g-C3N4 itself promotes the direct conversion of HMF to CO2 and H2O. By lowering the pH (4.01), a surprising switch of the photocatalytic chemoselectivity was observed with DFF becoming the main reaction product under acid reaction conditions.
On the other hand, in a recent contribution, it was demonstrated that when HMF was used as a sacrificial agent in the visible light-driven production of H2 from water splitting, the addition of Pt to mesoporous carbon nitrite (SGNC) has no significant role in photo-oxidation reactions but it only helps in charge separation (Fig. 26).428

Bimetallic Au–Ru nanoparticles, supported on reduced graphene oxide (rGO), show an excellent photocatalytic performance and stability – much higher than those registered with analogous Au/rGO and Ru/rGO systems in the partial oxidation of HMF into DFF under both laboratory and natural sunlight conditions – as a result of the transfer of photo-excited electrons from Ru to Au through the conductive graphene support.429
Besides TiO2 and g-C3N4, other heterogeneous systems were recently investigated,430–435 with cadmium-sulfide (CdS) based catalysts receiving increasing attention.430–432 Furthermore, ultrathin Ni/CdS nanosheets show good performance and robust stability in the photo-oxidation of DHMF to HMF and DFF using blue LED light (450 nm, 8 W) coupled with H2 production in water media.430 Computational investigations demonstrated the ancillary role of the aldehyde group in the conversion of HMF into DFF that adsorbs on the NiO(001) surface thus favouring the oxidation of the OH group. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity can be efficiently enhanced by doping the CdS support with phosphorus (P-ZnxCd1−xS)431 or by introducing nitrate salts (e.g. lithium, magnesium, calcium and manganese).432
In a very recent report, the research group of Prof. Triantafyllidi demonstrated that cheap and metal-free 1D manganese(IV) oxide nanorods are able to promote an almost complete HMF conversion into DFF (99% conversion, 100% DFF selectivity) under ambient conditions without the addition of bases or oxidants.433 Photo-reactions were carried out by using a LED light (365 nm) in acetonitrile media without H2 production in the reactor headspace suggesting the key role of O2 (in promoting photo-oxygenation and in inhibiting C–C bond cleavage) and H2O formation (in the deprotonation process) (Fig. 27).433

Excellent DFF selectivity can also be obtained in the presence of Nb2O5 and Fe(III)–Bi2MoO6 catalysts (90.0 and 95.3%, respectively); however, a much lower HMF conversion is registered.434,435
The n-type nanoporous BiVO4 photoanode was probably the first efficient attempt in the photoelectrochemical TEMPO-mediated HMF oxidation/H2 production.349 Furthermore, a borate buffer solution (0.5 M – pH 9.2) was used as an electrolyte with HMF (5.0 mM) added only to the TEMPO anolyte separated from the catholyte by a fritted glass (Fig. 28). The same research group used an identical photoassisted system for the reduction of HMF to DHMF clearly indicating the importance of pairing photo- and electro-catalysis for the simultaneous reductive and oxidative upgrading of biomass derived furanics in the absence of an external energy input.356

6. Conclusions and future prospects
Furfural (FUR) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) are widely considered among the most versatile bioderived platform molecules that can ensure the definitive consolidation of the modern biorefinery ensuing the necessary twilight of the fossil-based industry.
In this review, we focused on the recent advances in the preparation of FUR and HMF and in their unconventional catalytic upgrading into added value chemicals. An efficient production of biofuranics, with innovative and low environmental impact technologies, still requires a lot of efforts from the scientific and industrial community in order to increase FUR and HMF yields, but also to facilitate their separation and purification.
The preparation of FUR and HMF, starting from wastes and by-products obtained in the chemo-catalytic processing of biomass (e.g. humins), is surely an interesting and a possible way forward. Novel approaches involving heterogeneous catalytic materials, moderate reaction conditions, and green solvent systems are highly desired. A deeper understanding of the potentialities of MOFs for this type of reactions, as well as insights into the possibilities of photocatalysis, employing for instance sunlight irradiation, could be interesting options to be explored in the coming years. Remarkably, the scalability of FUR and HMF synthesis, employing environmentally friendly protocols, is also a challenging goal which needs to be achieved with continuous flow processes worth deep investigations.
With respect to their reductive and oxidative upgrading, in the last few years, unconventional catalytic routes have been explored with huge progress registered in the development of transfer hydrogenation (CTH), electrocatalytic (ECR) and photocatalytic (PCR) processes. FUR and HMF can be reductively converted, over a widespread plethora of monometallic and bimetallic heterogeneous catalysts, into furfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran and 2,5-dimethylfuran by using renewable liquid organic molecules (short chain aliphatic-alcohols, formic acid and silanes) as green and benign H-donor molecules. In this regard, excellent results were also obtained with non-precious metal systems with inexpensive zirconia-based catalysts and heterogeneous zeolites/metal–organic frameworks showing, under opportune reaction conditions, a direct conversion of FUR and HMF to γ-valerolactone (another important bioderived molecule with numerous practical applications) and to valuable C8–C12 fuel additives.
Transfer hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis reactions can be rapidly transferred into an industrial scale since they generally use technology processes (e.g. batch or semi-continuous mode) widely adopted by petroleum-based refineries. A higher impact of CTH of biomass derived FUR and HMF is plausible in the near future if reductive catalytic fractionation processes (lignin-first biorefining) will get a foothold. However, many scientific and technological challenges still lie ahead. In particular, 2-propanol is the most adopted solvent/H-donor molecule now; therefore, more research efforts in the use of renewable H-donors such as ethanol, methanol, 2-butanol and glycerol as well as life-cycle assessment studies on the overall environmental impact of CTH processes are needed. However, if the coproduct arisen from the dehydrogenation reaction of the H-donor/solvent does not constitute an added value chemical with its own market, it could give rise to issues on the separation costs and on the overall atom economy of the catalytic process. From this point of view, the use of formic acid (easily obtainable from renewable resources and characterized by low toxicity and flammability under mild reaction conditions) as a H-donor appears to be a green and sustainable solution.
At the same time, the increasingly competitive cost of renewable energy from the sun and wind makes the electrocatalytic conversion of furanics a valid asset for modern biorefinery also considering that most of the proposed reductive and oxidative electro-processes are generally performed at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Furthermore, FUR and HMF can be also used in both electrolytic chambers allowing the simultaneous formation of added value oxidative (at the anode) and reductive (at the cathode) products in high yield. Among all possible electro-oxidative reaction products, furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), being the biobased precursor of polyethylene furanoate (PEF) which will probably replace PET in the next few years, is attracting a lot of interest with photoassisted electrocatalytic processes being a new fascinating frontier to be explored. Nevertheless, the industrial applicability of the electrocatalytic conversion of biomass derived furans remains a breaking new ground. At present, the components of electrocatalytic devices are not standardized with no “all-inclusive” setups and with instruments’ costs higher than those of biorefinery technologies.
The photocatalytic upgrading of lignocellulosic derived furans is now becoming also a concrete alternative to standard thermochemical transformations with TiO2 and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) based materials being the most frequently chosen catalysts for their excellent performance in both reductive and oxidative reactions. Photocatalytic processes ensure the unquestionable benefit of the use of inexhaustible and costless solar energy; however, the engineering design/modeling and scale-up of reactors is foremost challenging since key aspects such as the optimization of phase interactions of biomass with light and catalytic surface, the complete control of mixing efficiency, heat and mass transfer as well as its integration with other biorefinery processes need to be fully addressed before their real adoption at an industrial scale.
However, even if the catalytic upgrading of FUR and HMF via CTH, ECR and PCR processes represents a significant opportunity, at present, most of the contributions are based on laboratory conditions that generally adopt diluted substrate feed (<2–5 wt%) in order to minimize the amount of humins and other by-products formed. Therefore, the real objective for the next upcoming years will be the transfer of these catalytic processes from laboratory to industrial scale paying also attention to maximizing solvent reuse and catalyst recycling.
At the same time, due to the high cost and lower availability of noble metals, more efforts should be made in the design and development of highly selective, cheap and long term stable non-noble metal catalytic systems able to convert biomass derived furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural into target products under mild reaction conditions. The preparation of stable and high-performing catalysts and the optimization of the reaction conditions can also overcome the intrinsic difficulties of the separation of furanic derivatives and their analogs from the reaction media at the end of the reaction.
In any case, whatever catalytic process is used, it is worth underlining the necessity to adopt safer industrial procedures and to take the right caution for human health and environment due to the intrinsic toxicity of biomass derived furans.
In conclusion, we hope that this review can provide a comprehensive overview of the actual state-of-the-art concerning novel preparation methods of bioderived furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and their innovative catalytic upgrading with the aim to promote scientific community's interest in the further development of these promising processes.
