The observed electrical conductivity is higher than the well-established Dirac materials, and is almost carrier concentration independent with similar behaviour of both n and p type carriers, which may certainly attract device applications. The low range of thermal conductivity is also evident from the phonon dispersion. Our present study further reports the gradual phase change of ZnGeSb2 from a normal semiconducting state, through massive Dirac states, to a topological semi-metal. The maximum power factor is observed in the massive Dirac states compared to the other two states.
1 Introduction
The increasing energy demand leads scientists to look for alternative energy sources. Thermoelectric materials (TEs) are one of the energy conversion materials which play a significant role in this area. Even though the research regarding thermoelectric materials started decades ago, the limitations in the efficiency of the existing TE materials have made this research an essential topic until today. TE materials can be used to convert waste heat into electricity. Through this waste heat conversion, this material will help to reduce environmental pollution and this makes this energy source unique. The dimensionless quantity known as the figure of merit ZT is the parameter that defines the efficiency of a TE material. The figure of merit is defined as ZT = S2σT/κ, where S, σ, κ, and T are the thermopower, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and absolute temperature, respectively. κ includes both the electronic κe and the lattice κl contributions.1 A good thermoelectric material should have a high Seebeck coefficient, high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity. To attain the maximum Seebeck coefficient, a material with a high band mass is essential, and for achieving good electrical conductivity the mobility of the material should be high, leading to lower band mass carriers, implying the need for a mixture of heavy and light bands in the band structure. These contradicting dependencies limit the value of the figure of merit, which leads to low efficiencies of thermoelectric materials. Though compounds like Bi2Te32 have been used commercially, research is more focussed on improving the performance of TE materials and this happens in several ways leading to the search for new materials, improvement of existing bulk TE materials by super-lattice structures and the application of pressure, identification of low dimensional materials,3etc. The general trend of enhancing the performance of a TE material is mainly via two methods: one is enhancement of the power factor, which mainly depends upon the electronic properties, and the other is to suppress the lattice thermal conductivity. Since the power factor is highly dependent on the electronic structure, the enhancement of the power factor can be controlled by tuning the electronic structure of the material, and this can be achieved by the application of pressure or strain.4,5 In the recent past, the thermoelectric properties of materials were found to be connected with different quantum states of matter like topological insulators, semimetals, Dirac materials, etc., and studies have proved that a significant number of TE materials are topological insulators.6,7 One such example is the potential application of graphene, a 2D Dirac material8 which influenced materials research, and it became a dominant research area in condensed matter theory and experimental research. There are several studies reported on the thermoelectric properties of graphene,9,10 and the latest study revealed the enhancement of the power factor in graphene/hBN devices.11 Apart from graphene and graphene like materials, topological insulators like TlBiSe2,12 Bi2Te3,13etc., also host surface Dirac states. Subsequently some of the 3D materials like Cd3As2 and Na3Bi were found to show Dirac cones in the bulk14–16 form, and this discovery accelerated the research on 3D Dirac materials. In 3D Dirac materials, the conduction and valence bands will touch each other at a particular point, and from that point we can observe linearly dispersive energy eigenstates in all momentum directions. This can be described by a pseudo-relativistic Dirac equation, and these materials can be considered as 3D analogues of graphene. Spin–orbit coupling plays a crucial role in these materials, and in addition to that small perturbations like strain and chemical potential can help in tuning the 3D bulk Dirac states in these compounds. In Dirac materials themselves, massless and massive Dirac fermions are observed, and graphene has massless Dirac fermions, and compounds like Pb1−xSnxTe have massive fermions also,17 and this arises due to the small opening between the Dirac points. Current studies on graphene showed that a small band gap between Dirac points is helpful for good device applications,18,19 which enabled further studies to improve the application of graphene by opening a gap between the Dirac cones. The wide range of applications of materials that carry massless or massive Dirac fermions has motivated scientists to add further compounds to this family. To our knowledge there are very few studies available which connect the Dirac states and transport properties.20 This further encourages us to examine how a massive Dirac state will influence thermoelectric properties. We have chosen ZnGeSb2, which is a member of the chalcopyrite family, to explore the TE properties further.
Chalcopyrite type materials find applications in non-linear optics devices, solar cells, photovoltaic materials, thermoelectric devices, etc.21–24 Generally these materials crystallize in a tetragonal structure, and can be considered as isoelectronic analogues of the zinc blende structure. The high melting point and earth abundance of these compounds make them more attractive towards different device applications. Many compounds like ZnGeP2 and CdSiP2 are found to have applications in non-linear optical devices,25,26 while Au and Cu based compounds have emerged as good thermoelectric materials, and one Cu based compound, CuGaTe2, has a figure of merit of around 1.4.27 A recent study revealed the thermoelectric properties of Zn based pnictide semiconductors,28 and some chalcopyrite and pnictide based compounds are reported as topological insulators,29 and this inspired us to choose a compound from this family. Here we are trying to explore the electronic structure and thermoelectric properties of ZnGeSb2. A previous study on the chalcopyrite family revealed the possibility of tuning a compound to topologically non-trivial states using strain.29
2 Methodology
Structural optimization and phonon calculations are carried out using the pseudopotential method implemented in the plane wave self-consistent field (Pwscf) program.30 The electronic properties were calculated using a full potential linearised augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method implemented in the WIEN2K package.31,32 It is well known that traditional exchange functionals like the local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) underestimate the band gap of semiconductors and insulators, so we have used the Tran–Blaha modified Becke–Johnson (TB-mBJ) functional.33,34 As we know that spin orbit coupling has a crucial role in the electronic properties, we have included spin orbit coupling in our calculations. For total energy calculations, band structures and density of states, we have used 10 × 10 × 10 k-points in the full Brillouin zone. Transport coefficients such as the thermopower (S in μV K−1) and electrical conductivity scaled by the relaxation time (σ/τ in Ω−1 m−1 s−1) were calculated using the BoltzTraP code35 with a dense k-mesh of the order of 50 × 50 × 50 k-points. The BoltzTraP code is based on the rigid band approximation (RBA)36–38 and the constant scattering time approximation (CSTA), and these approximations have been successfully applied for several thermoelectric materials.39–43
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structural, electronic and thermoelectric properties under ambient conditions
The investigated ZnGeSb2 compound crystallizes in the tetragonal chalcopyrite type structure with space group I2d as seen in Fig. 1(a). In this structure, each Sb anion is coordinated by two Zn and Ge type cations, and each cation (Zn or Ge) is tetrahedrally coordinated by Sb atoms. The optimized lattice parameters of ZnGeSb2 are given in Table 1. The phonon dispersion plot represented in Fig. 1(b) further validates the stability of ZnGeSb2. The primitive cell of ZnGeSb2 has 8 atoms in the unit cell which cause 24 phonon modes for each wave vector in this compound. The acoustic modes are represented in a blue colour and the optical modes are represented in a red colour. From the phonon dispersion plots it is clear that the low frequency optical modes interact with the acoustic modes with a frequency of around 50 cm−1, which indicates strong phonon–phonon scattering, and leads to low thermal conductivity in this compound.44 For further investigation we have calculated the electronic structure properties. Since traditional exchange functionals like the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) underestimate the band gap of semiconductors, we have calculated the electronic properties using the TB-mBJ functional. The calculated band structures at the optimized volume along different high symmetry directions, Γ–Z and Γ–N, are given in Fig. 2(a and d). From the figure one can clearly see the highly linearly dispersive band structure near the Fermi level at around the Γ point. To capture the proper nature of this band structure, we have given the three-dimensional representation of band projection in the kx, ky and ky, kz planes (see Fig. 2(b, c, e and f)). Now one can see the dispersion, which exactly represents a gapped Dirac state in the low energy region, with small anisotropy along different high symmetric directions (Γ–Z and Γ–N). The three-dimensional representation of the projection along different momentum directions gives a clear idea that the dispersions along the different momentum directions are the same, indicating the presence of a 3D Dirac cone in the band structure. The band gap of the compound is direct. The presence of time reversal symmetry has been verified using spin-polarised calculations. Highly linearly dispersed bands imply the carriers to exhibit a low band mass, which we have confirmed using effective mass calculations (see Table 2). The calculated elastic constants of ZnGeSb2 at the optimized volume are represented in Table 3, and this confirmed the stability of this compound. The calculated Debye temperature is comparable to other chalcopyrite materials and a few zintl phase compounds,45,46 and the low value of the Debye temperature indicates the possibility of a low thermal conductivity of this compound.

The thermoelectric properties of a material are derived from its transport coefficients like the thermopower, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity. The discussion regarding thermal conductivity can be taken up separately. The parameters like the thermopower and electrical conductivity scaled by the relaxation time under ambient conditions are summarised in Fig. 3. The magnitude of the thermopower is found to vary slowly as a function of carrier concentration. This behaviour is different from the normal semiconducting nature where the magnitude of the thermopower is found to decrease with carrier concentration; to compare the behaviour with a semiconductor we have represented the variation of the thermopower of ZnGeAs2 in the same figure. We have observed the electrical conductivity scaled by the relaxation time to increase by several orders of magnitude (around 3 × 1025 Ω−1 m−1 s−1) compared to a normal semiconductor (see the ZnGeAs2 case in Fig. 3(b)), and it showed almost the same value for all studied concentrations. Both the thermopower and electrical conductivity scaled by the relaxation time show unusual responses compared to normal semiconductors, which also indicate the highly linearised dispersion in this compound. The carrier independent nature of the thermopower and electrical conductivity opens up the possibility of TE applications in a wide range of concentrations, which may be attractive for experimentalists. The huge value of the electrical conductivity will play a very crucial role in the thermoelectric properties of this compound, which will be discussed in the next section. The fine tuning of these kinds of compounds using some perturbations like spin orbit coupling, strain, and chemical substitutions can lead to different states in this compound, which motivated us to check the electronic and thermoelectric properties in a range of volumes slightly higher and lower than our optimized volume.

3.2 Electronic and thermoelectric properties under strain
We have examined how the band profile of ZnGeSb2 is changed by the application of strain (hydrostatic strain has been applied with respect to the optimized volume). The band gap is found to be decreased with the application of expansive strain, and increased for compressive strain. The band structure along the Γ–Z high symmetric direction and the projection along k vector directions at the compressive strain volume are presented in Fig. 4. The calculated band gap at this compressive volume (−4.6%) is 0.33 eV, and the parabolic nature of the band structure observed in this certainly reveal the volume dependent electronic properties of this compound. With the expansion of the volume, the band gap decreases, and it is found to close at 2.4% strain, and for further strains it starts opening again at around 3.2%. The band structures for a few strains are represented in Fig. 5(a–d). The band profile at 1.6% strain is represented here, and it shows a similar behaviour as the optimized structure, with a lower band gap. This kind of highly linearly dispersive nature is an indication of Dirac states; here the valence and conduction band tips are not touching each other, indicating this state to be a massive Dirac state. For further strains, at around 2.4%, the band gap is found to be closed, and in this state the conduction band is just touching the Fermi level. For 2.6% strain also the band nature is the same but the conduction band starts dipping down to the valence band, by maintaining a small gap between the conduction band tip and the valence band tip. At around 2.6% strain, the dispersive nature of the band is observed similar to 2.4% strain, but we have observed that the conduction band is further moving towards the valence band. The details of the relative conduction and valence band tip positions from the Fermi level along with the gap between the conduction and valence band tips are given in Table 4. For further strain at around 3.2%, the band nature has changed, that is the conduction band is lifted upward, and the valence band started crossing the Fermi level. The band structure of this strained state is given in Fig. 5(d), where we can observe the crossing of the valence band through the Fermi level along Γ–X. The closing and opening of the bulk band gap and the change of the band nature from an indirect band gap to a direct band gap along with the application of hydrostatic strain prompted us to check the topology change in this compound. For this purpose we have plotted the band structure at different strains together with the total ‘s’ character; see Fig. 5(e–h). At a compressive volume around −4.6% strain, ZnGeSb2 is found to be an indirect band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 0.33 eV. At this state, s like (Γ6) bands dominate near the CBM (conduction band minimum) and p like (Γ8) bands dominate near the VBM (valence band maximum). The parameter E0 is defined as the energy difference between s like Γ6 bands and p like Γ8 bands (E0 = E(Γ6) − E(Γ8)). At this volume, E0 is around +0.35 eV, and this positive value confirms the normal semiconducting nature at compressive strain, and this is in good agreement with a previous study.29 At 2.4% strain the band order is found to be reversed, at the Γ point, where the s like bands are shifted below the VBM and aligned below the ‘p’ like bands (see Fig. 5(f)). The size of the circle represents the s character, and upon hydrostatic expansion one can easily observe the size of the circle at the Γ point in the conduction band to reduce and in the valence band it is found to increase. This is an indication of band inversion which is crucial in topological insulating behaviour. In this expanded state we found that the value E0 became negative at around −0.07 eV, where the s like Γ6 band is aligned 0.07 eV below the VBM. The schematic of the electronic structure over a range of volumes is given in Fig. 6. While analysing the band structure systematically, one can clearly see that at compressive strain (see Fig. 4), the compound is a normal semiconductor, at around our optimized volume it shows a highly linearly dispersive band profile and this profile continued up to 3.2% strain, and at around 2.4% strain we have observed band inversion also. This clearly indicates the three states of this compound, normal semiconductor, massive Dirac states and topological semi-metal. In addition to this, tuning of massive Dirac states can be observed by the application of expansive strain. Below 2.4% the Fermi level is aligned in between the Dirac states, and after 2.4% strain, the Fermi level is aligned just above the Dirac states. At 2.4% strain we can see the Fermi level to be very close to the Dirac states, which means that there are three stages, below and above 2.4% strain, the Fermi level is far from the Dirac states, and at 2.4% strain, the Fermi level almost lies on the Dirac states. We can connect this with the conductivity of this compound in these strained states, implying that at 2.4% strain the density of states near the Fermi level will be very low because of the Dirac states, and this may restrict the conductivity, but above and below 2.4%, the Fermi level is far from the Dirac states, so a sufficient density of states can be expected, so that these states lead to good electrical conductivity, a similar situation to the case of graphene.47 From the calculated electronic structure we have found the semiconducting, massive Dirac and topologically inverted states of ZnGeSb2. In the following paragraph we will discuss the transport properties of these states.

 Fig. 6  Schematic of the electronic structure as a function of strain. 
The interesting part of the electronic structure of this compound has already been discussed, and now one can analyse the thermoelectric properties, and these are summarised in Fig. 7. In this figure, the variation of the transport coefficients as a function of strain at a carrier concentration of around 5.0 × 1019 cm−3 at 300 K and as a function of carrier concentration from 1.0 × 1018 cm−3 to 1.0 × 1020 cm−3 is given. As expected from the electronic structure, peculiar behaviours of the thermoelectric coefficients are observed. The magnitude of the thermopower is found to be decreased for expansive strain and increased for compressive strain, which indicate that in the compressive states, the compound has a normal semiconducting nature where the thermopower is high compared to the ambient and expanded states, which are the ones where the system has massive Dirac states. The reduction of the magnitude of the thermopower might be due the small band mass near the Fermi level. The thermopower has a local peak at 2.4% strain, where the electronic topology is changing. The electrical conductivity scaled by the relaxation time exhibits a huge increment (in the order of 1 × 1025 Ω−1 m−1 s−1) in the Dirac states compared to normal semiconducting states. Fig. 7 shows that for negative strains the electrical conductivity scaled by the relaxation time is less than those of the ambient and expanded states (massive Dirac states). To understand the overall thermoelectric properties, we have given the power factor also, where one can clearly observe from the figure that at around the optimized volume there is a huge increment in the power factor, with a subsequent decrease, and after 2.4% it starts increasing. Among the massive Dirac states, one can clearly see that the strained states which hold the Fermi level far from the Dirac points are more favourable. Similar observations were mentioned in graphene based studies.48 From the figure it is evident that the magnitude of the power factor is similar for both holes and electrons, which indicates the possibility of device applications for this compound. There is huge anisotropy in the power factor observed in the Dirac states, the ‘c’ axis is more beneficial than the ‘a’ axis for the optimized volume. One point we would like to mention here is that all the Dirac states observed in this study were massive Dirac states, where we have observed a gap between two Dirac points, which is beneficial for device applications, unlike the massless state in graphene. Recent research on graphene is evolving in a direction where people are trying to open a small gap between the degenerate Dirac points.47 This shows the significance of the investigated material. Overall the maximum power factor observed at the optimized state is several orders of magnitude higher than the power factor observed for the normal semiconducting state, and also the magnitude of the power factor observed in the Dirac state is higher than the power factors of well-known thermoelectric materials.28,49 In Fig. 7(f), we have compared the power factor of our investigated compound at its massive Dirac state with other materials. The magnitude of the thermal conductivity also plays a crucial role in the performance of thermoelectric materials. The investigated phonon dispersion and calculated Debye temperature gave strong evidence of low lattice thermal conductivity. The magnitude of the thermal conductivity of the chalcopyrite family has been previously investigated,50 and it has been reported that the prototype structures ZnGeP2 and ZnGeAs2 have lattice thermal conductivities of 158 mW (cm K)−1 and 117 mW (cm K)−1, respectively. As we know that the magnitude of the lattice thermal conductivity will be reduced if one replaces As with Sb; the magnitude of the lattice thermal conductivity of ZnGeSb2 can be expected to be less than that of ZnGeAs2.

(f) Comparison of the power factor with other materials: PbTe49 and ZnSiP2.28 Solid line for p-type and dashed line for n-type. 
To estimate the range of the power factor (S2σ), which is independent of the relaxation time, we have assumed the relaxation times to be 1 × 10−14 s and 1 × 10−15 s, and the calculated electrical conductivity (σ) and power factor (S2σ) are given in Table 5. We have observed a high power factor due to the ultra-high conductivity. The conductivity values observed for both the relaxation times are very high compared to other established materials; the comparison is given in Table 5. In addition to this, the conductivity value is higher than the reported conductivity of the Dirac semimetal Cd3As2.51 In Fig. 8, we have summarised the TE properties of ZnGeSb2 in a schematic way. In the area of thermoelectric materials, we have observed an enhancement of the power factor (S2σ) due to some external effects like pressure or a reduction of the dimensions. Here in the present study, the bulk optimized structure itself showed a huge power factor. To predict the exact figure of merit, knowledge of the relaxation time is needed. The spin relaxation time of graphene is predicted to be on the order of 1 × 10−15.52 If one can experimentally verify the lattice thermal conductivity and relaxation time of ZnGeSb2, it will turn out to be an excellent thermoelectric material.

4 Conclusion
Highly tunable massive Dirac states and their transport properties were discussed systematically. The investigated compound is found to be an excellent material for thermoelectric applications due to massive Dirac states, which lead to a huge power factor, ultra-high conductivity and low thermal conductivity. In addition to that the topological inversion in this compound is also analysed. The mechanical and dynamical properties revealed the stability and low thermal conductivity of this compound. Compared to other chalcopyrite thermoelectric materials the present compound exhibits a huge power factor in its stable massive Dirac states. The electrical conductivity scaled by the relaxation time and the thermopower is found to be almost carrier independent, which may certainly lead to device applications and needs to be verified experimentally.
