    , Accepted 26th July 2021First published on 26th July 2021AbstractOwing to perovskite possessing the outstanding optoelectronic properties, perovskite-based solar cells show prominent performance. The stability of perovskite-based solar cells hampers the progress of commercialization, so it is important to understand the microstructure mechanism of perovskite degradation under the humidity and oxygen environmental conditions. In this study, a meaningful Debye-type dielectric relaxation was observed under water vapor and oxygen co-treatment conditions. Interestingly, the relaxation was not observed under water vapor or oxygen treatment individually. This new dielectric relaxation is identified as a direct result of dipole jump, and its activation energy was measured to be 630 ± 6 meV. According to photoelectron spectroscopy and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance data, we suggest that the dipoles are formed by CH3NH3+ (MA+) and superoxide (O2−), which originate from the distorted crystal lattice and water vapor-weakened hydrogen bonds of Pb–I cages. In addition, the activation energy fitted by dielectric relaxation might be the energy of ion migration. This study contributes to understanding the mechanism of perovskite degradation from the view of microstructure relaxation and evolution, and also provides a method for the analysis of ion migration energy.
Introduction
Owning to its ease-of-fabrication as well as excellent properties such as optical absorption and charge carrier diffusion lengths, methylammonium lead halide is a star material for applications in photovoltaics, light emission and photodetectors.1–6 In particular, its solar cells have seen a rapid rise in power conversion efficiencies, which rival those of commercially available devices based on silicon, GaAs and CIGS.7–10 However, its long-term stability remains an issue to be addressed. Approaches in this direction include mixed cation doping,11–13 defect passivation,14–16 low-dimensionality,17–19 and optimization of transport materials.20–22
Theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that the degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 can be attributed to the actions of water, oxygen and light.23–27 Wang et al. found that the perovskite is highly sensitive to moisture.28 Kamat et al. investigated its ground-state and excited-state optical absorptions in the presence of water, and found that it does not simply decompose into PbI2 and MAI, but forms a hydrate product.29 Infrared spectroscopy by Lovrinčić et al. reveals that fast infiltration proceeds at much lower humidity than previously reports.30 They suggested that absorbed water molecules significantly weaken the hydrogen bond between an MA cation and the Pb–I cage. Li et al. locate the decomposition at gain edges and void areas.31
Oxygen also plays a destructive role. Aristidou et al. attribute this to the formation of highly reactive superoxide O2− and remarkably fast oxygen diffusion,25 which is in agreement with Wang et al.27 Using in situ techniques to probe the mechanism, Kelly et al. identified isolated PbI64− octahedra as degradation occurs, but stability can be enhanced through the selection of the hole transport layer.32 Bao et al. observe surface dipoles induced by chemisorbed oxygen, leading to shifts in work function and ionization potential.23 Most recently, Long et al. demonstrate that the charge carrier life time can be strongly influenced by oxygen species.33 Encapsulation can improve stability significantly;34,35 nevertheless, Cheng et al. report that devices so protected still degrade after prolonged aging at high temperature and humidity.36 The post-mortem analysis shows that the perovskite has decomposed into HI and CH3NH2, both gases known to corrode silver layers. Miyano et al. ascribe the degradation to deep trap states.37
Much efforts have revealed the perovskite degradation process and its degraded products, which is induced by water and oxygen. However, in this study, we focus on the initial stage of the perovskite exposed to water vapor and oxygen (the exposure time is 30 min). We find that the morphology has no changes after water vapor or oxygen exposure, but the temperature-dependent dielectric spectrum shows significant signals. It means that the microstructure was evolved after short time water vapor and oxygen exposure. To analyze the role of water vapor and oxygen in microstructure evolution, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) were utilized to assess the physical and chemical environment of perovskite components. In addition, the activation energy is calculated by the dielectric relaxation and regarded as the energy of MA ion migration.
Results and discussions
Temperature-dependent dielectric spectroscopy is an efficient measurement for the polarization of materials. It is known that some asymmetric molecules and defects can be equivalent to dipoles in a dielectric medium. When measuring the medium materials in a temperature-dependent dielectric spectrum system, these dipoles will turn around to follow the alternative electric field. The dipoles can follow the alternative electric field closely when the electric field frequency is low. However, in the case of high frequency, phase difference occurs between the electric field frequency and the turning of dipoles. Then, the lagging of dipole reorientation under extra electric field will result in the dielectric loss (DL), which can reflect a relaxation processes arising from the presence of either space charge or electric dipoles in the medium.
The perovskite powders before measurement were exposed at different environments: nitrogen (labeled pristine), water vapor (humidity = 45 ± 5%), oxygen, water vapor and oxygen co-existence (water–oxygen). Notably, all perovskite materials were prepared in a N2-filled glove box, and then transferred to target environments. In order to further simulate the initial stage of water and oxygen induced degradation, gas pressure was kept at 1 atm and the exposure time was 30 min under dark condition to exclude the light impact. Fig. 1a shows the DL of pristine CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) powder in a temperature range from 220 K to 345 K under selected frequencies (111 Hz, 316 Hz, 626 Hz, and 1111 Hz). It clearly shows that the DL increased smoothly and is dependent on temperature. Under water vapor and oxygen treatment conditions (Fig. 1b and c), the DL exhibited the same increment with pristine samples, suggesting that there is no change in the polarization signal originating from the material interior. However, a sharp peak was observed at 266 K in the case of oxygen. From the analysis of the normalized spectrum of permittivity (Fig. S1, ESI†), a mutation also occurred at the temperature of 266 K, indicating that a phase transition occurred under oxygen treatment. According to the previous first principles calculation by Li et al., the adsorbed oxygen could induce the octahedral cage rotation, resulting in crystal structure distortion.38 Therefore, the distorted crystalline lattice may be attributed to the observed phase transition, which was recorded by temperature-dependent dielectric spectrum measurement. This result also further confirms the theoretical calculation conversely.

Interestingly, a Debye-type relaxation (Fig. 1d) was observed at room temperature under water–oxygen condition. Moreover, the oxygen-induced phase transition disappeared. Considering the co-existence of water vapor and oxygen, we think that water vapor can weaken the hydrogen bonding between the organic cation and Pb–I cage, thus altering the octahedral rotation along the Z axis when oxygen is adsorbed, resulting in a Debye-type relaxation. In addition, the inset confirms the relation lnf = ln(f0) − Ea/k* (1/T), where f and T denote excitation frequency and temperature, respectively, and k is the Boltzmann constant, with usual notations for the Arrhenius parameters. From least squares fitting, this Debye-type relaxation has an activation energy (Ea) of 630 ± 6 meV.
In the practical application, perovskite solar cells are usually composed of a sandwich structure with perovskite film, carrier transport layers (electronic transport layers and hole transport layers) and electrodes. Therefore, the temperature-dependent dielectric spectrum was further applied to the perovskite films to investigate the dielectric properties (Fig. 2a). After the water–oxygen treatment, the relaxation can be observed clearly (Fig. 2b), but the activation energy is 465 ± 15 meV, which is different from powders. This result implicates that an analogous origination of relaxation in the different form polycrystalline perovskite materials. This difference will be summarized in the following discussion.

The Dielectric loss of MAPbI3 single crystal with (c) pristine and (d) water–oxygen treatment. Insets in (b and d) are the Arrhenius fit to loss peaks. 
Regarding their origin, it can be hypothesized that charge carriers including ions drifting under electric field, carrier accumulation near grain boundaries or interface cause space charge polarization.39–41 To seek confirmation, we analyze the temperature-dependent dielectric spectroscopy measurements on single crystal MAPbI3 to provide evidence for relaxation origination. Fig. 2c and d present its DL spectra. No loss peaks appeared in pristine, but relaxation was observed when exposing to water–oxygen. From the insertion in Fig. 2d, the activation energy of the relaxation is derived as 675 ± 35 meV. Therefore, even in the absence of grain boundaries, water vapor and oxygen also induced relaxation, and the activation energy rose significantly after eliminating errors. This result demonstrates that the relaxation originates from dipoles, rather than space charge polarization. Further confirmation of the dipoles from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements is presented in Fig. 3a. The derived energy level diagram from Fig. 3a of pristine and water–oxygen treatment samples are shown in Fig. 3b. The valence band maximum clearly downshifts to the lower energy after water–oxygen exposure; however, the Fermi level upshifts discernibly that close to the conduction band minimum, suggesting the formation of dipoles and n-type doping. Also, the changes may be ascribed to oxygen and water, respectively.23

Previous studies have reported that water and oxygen can decompose the perovskite into PbI2 and MAI.28,42 We applied the temperature-dependent dielectric spectrum measurement on PbI2 and MAI, respectively. The results are presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†). After water–oxygen exposure, the dielectric loss shows smooth increment, and no relaxations are observed. It means that the dipoles are related to the intrinsic perovskite. Further evidences are also seen in the XRD (Fig. S3, ESI†) and SEM results (Fig. S4, ESI†). After a short-time water–oxygen treatment, the perovskite crystal lattice was not destroyed. This confirms that the relaxation is not attributed to PbI2 and MAI. However, the performance of solar cells has declined. Fig. 3c shows the statistical results of device parameters obtained from the same batch of 25 individual devices based on pristine and water–oxygen treatments. The champion and average values are summarized in Table 1. These results further indicate that the dipoles can decrease the device performance.

For further characterization of the microstructure evolution under water–oxygen treatment, the solid-state 13C NMR experiments were carried out on MAPbI3.43Fig. 3d illustrates the spin–lattice relaxation time (T1) obtained at various temperatures from 20 °C to 90 °C. The T1 values for the water–oxygen sample observed at 23.30 °C, 34.52 °C, 45.75 °C, 56.97 °C, 68.20 °C, 79.42 °C and 90.65 °C is 12.23 s, 13.07 s, 14.08 s, 14.75 s, 15.00 s, 14.95 s and 14.69 s, respectively, all lower than the corresponding values of 13.61 s, 15.07 s, 16.11 s, 17.17 s, 17.66 s, 17.69 s, 17.40 s for pristine. The accelerated relaxation of the methyl radical under the magnetic field implies its slower spin, which may be attributed to steric hindrance from the O2− radical. This suggests that water–oxygen can influence the environment of the MA cation. Further implication is that dipole relaxation depends on the cation. Considering the reorientation of dipoles under electric field, the activation energy of relaxation could be corresponded to the migration energy of MA ions. In addition, the higher barrier height for a single crystal (compare with polycrystalline) perovskite might be attributed to the higher energy of ions migration, and the conclusion is also feasible to perovskite powder and film, as obtained above.
For clarification on how absorbents affect the cations, FTIR was performed on MAPbI3, as compacted pellets after mixing with KBr, followed by conditioning in different atmospheres. All samples displayed medium strong CH3 rocking at 910 cm−1, NH3 rocking at 960 cm−1, C–H scissoring at 1470 cm−1, N–H bending at 1630 cm−1 and NH3 stretching at 3110 cm−1.44–46 However, the sample exposed to water–oxygen present indiscernible changes (Fig. 4a), meaning none of new or disrupted chemical bonds are present, which indicates that the dipoles stem from physical adsorption. XPS further demonstrates this viewpoint. The XPS survey spectra (Fig. 4b) and Pb 4f, I 3d, N 1s (Fig. S5a–c, ESI†) show none of new features after water–oxygen exposure, suggesting that there is negligible effect on perovskite chemical composition in our short-time exposure. In addition, the area increments of O 1s (Fig. S5d, ESI†) provide the evidence for the fast oxygen adsorption in air.

According to the aforementioned evidence, we conclude that the absorbed water molecule weaken the hydrogen bonding between the organic cation and the Pb–I cage, resulting in a relatively weak distortion of the perovskite crystal and decomposes the terminate surface. Owning to the impurities in the perovskite and the small binding energy of excitons, there might be free carriers even without light illumination at room temperature, which can readily react with the oxygen to form superoxide (O2−).47,48 Moreover, this distorted crystal lattice can be beneficial for the coupling between superoxide (O2−) and MA cation. Therefore, the generated ion O2− forms a dipole with the MA cation at the surface of the altered crystal. The proposed schematic is illustrated in Fig. 4c. Combining the 13C NMR experimental results mentioned above, it is concluded that the migratory ion is MA cation, and the migration energy of MA cation derived by relaxation is in well agreement with the former theoretical predictions range (0.46 eV–0.84 eV).49,50 Furthermore, it also implied that the MA migration energy might be different in polycrystalline and single crystal perovskite, which could be ascribed to the proved lower trap-density. As for the perovskite powder and films, the different synthesis process of perovskite materials may cause the difference in ion migration energy. For the MA/FA mixing system, if the dominate cation is MA, the similar degradation mechanism is expected.
Conclusion
A Debye-type dielectric relaxation co-induced by water and oxygen was observed by the temperature-dependent dielectric spectrum under low frequency, and it serves as a probe to investigate the initial stage of perovskite degradation. The relaxation observed in both perovskite powders, films and single-crystal MAPbI3 indicates that the relaxation originated from dipoles formed by water and oxygen, and further confirmed by ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy. Combining the 13C NMR, FTIR and XPS measurements, we deduced that the water vapor can weaken the hydrogen bonding between CH3NH3+ and the Pb–I cage, and then the superoxide, originated from excess carries, act as the negative pole to coupling with the MA cations. According to the reorientation of dipoles under electric field, the results further indicate that the migration energy of MA is 630 ± 6 meV. In addition, this dipole may act as recombination centers to further trigger the performance deterioration in perovskite solar cells. This study provides a physical view through dielectric measurements, which will be helpful for comprehending the perovskite degradation mechanism.
Experimental
Materials and samples preparation
PbI2, CH3NH3I (MAI), and CH3NH3PbI3 powder were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The perovskite precursor were prepared by dissolving 1.1 mol MAI and 1.1 mol PbI2 into a DMF and DMSO solvent (DMF:DMSO = 4:1). Then, the as-prepared precursor was stirred at 60 °C for 6 h before use. The parameters of perovskite film fabrication process was reported previously.51 The process of inverted perovskite solar cells with the structure of ITO/NiO/perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag are following: an ITO/glass substrate was cleaned with acetone, ethyl alcohol and deionized water for 20 min each, followed by UV-ozone treatment for 20 min. The NiO particle ink was spin-coated on top of the ITO substrate according to the previously reported.52–54 Then, the perovskite precursor was then deposited upon the NiO film at 1000 rpm for 6 s and 4000 rpm for 25 cs. Then, 120 ul ethyl acetate was dripped during spin-coating. Moreover, the samples were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Then, 25 nm C60, 8 nm BCP and 100 nm Ag were thermal evaporated at vacuum <5 × 10−4 subsequently.
Dielectric measurement
CH3NH3PbI3 in powder, film or single crystal was investigated inside a home-made vacuum chamber fitted with liquid–nitrogen cooling and resistance heating, containing a hygrometer (model 1360A from TES) and the sample holder (with Cu electrodes) for 2-terminal measurement. In the case of a powder specimen, a hollow cylindrical Teflon tube of 1 cm in diameter was tightly filled with the powder to 1 mm in depth, and then capped with copper plates at both ends. The data were recorded by an Agilent E4980A meter at twelve selected frequencies under an application of 1.0 V as it was reheated to 473 K at the controlled rate of 1 K min−1. During the heating its temperature was independently monitored by a Cu–CuNi thermocouple calibrated to 0.1 K in reproducibility and accuracy.
Measurement and characterization
A Prestige-21 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) was used to examine films before and after the treatment in oxygen with water. 13C Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were also recorded in a Bruker Advance III 500M spectrometer running Topspin 3.2 software. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected of oxygen–water treated films in a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer using Cu K radiation of 1.5406 Å. The morphology of the perovskite was characterized by SEM (Zeiss Sigma 300, with an InLens detector). A Keithley 2400 source meter helped to trace the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of fabricated cells; all tested under AM 1.5G solar simulation with 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The XPS and UPS measurements were recorded by a ThermoFisher 250xi spectrometer.
