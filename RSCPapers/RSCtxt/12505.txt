    First published on 8th September 2016AbstractThe development and utilization of solar energy in environmental remediation and water splitting is being intensively studied worldwide. During the past few decades, tremendous efforts have been devoted to developing non-toxic, low-cost, efficient and stable photocatalysts for water splitting and environmental remediation. To date, several hundreds of photocatalysts mainly based on metal oxides, sulfides and (oxy)nitrides with different structures and compositions have been reported. Among them, perovskite oxides and their derivatives (layered perovskite oxides) comprise a large family of semiconductor photocatalysts because of their structural simplicity and flexibility. This review specifically focuses on the general background of perovskite and its related materials, summarizes the recent development of perovskite photocatalysts and their applications in water splitting and environmental remediation, discusses the theoretical modelling and calculation of perovskite photocatalysts and presents the key challenges and perspectives on the research of perovskite photocatalysts.

1. Introduction
Solar energy is the ultimate source of renewable energy for addressing the energy crisis and global warming challenge. The utilization of solar energy in environmental remediation and solar chemical conversion is being intensively studied worldwide.1,2 Among a variety of solar conversion technologies, semiconductor photocatalysis driven water splitting and CO2 reduction (or artificial photosynthesis) have been demonstrated as promising ways for converting solar energy into chemical fuels.3–5 Using the same concept, semiconductor photocatalysis has also been extensively investigated for potential applications in environmental remediation including the degradation and removal of organic pollutants in aqueous/air phase,6,7 reduction of heavy metal ions,8–10 bacterial inactivation,11–13etc. During the past few decades, tremendous efforts have been devoted to developing efficient, low-cost and stable photocatalysts, especially those that can work under visible light such as In1−xNixTaO4,14 (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx),15 CaBi2O4,16 Ag/AgCl,17 AgPO4,18 hydrogenated TiO2,19 and metal-free photocatalysts including graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4),20 boron carbide,21 elemental α-sulfur,22 rhombohedral boron,23 P-doped graphene,24 nanoporous carbon,25 carbon dot embedded C3N426 and organic polymer photocatalysts.27–29 Although water splitting in suspension systems is considered as not practically feasible as that in photoelectrochemical systems in terms of the separation of generated H2 and O2 for inhibition of back recombination,30–33 this drawback could be overcome by constructing a Z-scheme system34 or selectively loading H2 and O2 evolution co-catalysts on different sites in a single particulate catalyst.35 In addition, a particulate semiconductor photocatalyst has the following interesting features that distinguish itself from a photoelectrochemical system: (1) electrolytes are not needed; (2) each photocatalyst works as a microphotoelectrode; (3) it possesses large surface areas (104 to 106 cm2 g−1), and the flux of the photogenerated carriers per unit surface is very small, compared with that of the bulk electrode; (4) it is much simpler for large-scale applications, which do not require applying an external bias and manufacturing nanostructured photoelectrodes. To date, a few hundred photocatalysts mainly including metal oxides, metal sulfides and metal (oxy)nitrides have been reported. However, the reported external quantum yield at a given visible light wavelength for pure water splitting in a particulate system is still far below the solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency goal of 10% for practical applications.36 Considering the huge potential of “solar + water → clean fuel”, photocatalysis has been considered as one of the Holy Grails of chemistry and material fields, and it is highly desirable to develop new photocatalysts to boost the solar conversion efficiency. This has also led to decades-long intensive research efforts on the search for new photocatalysts, especially for those that can harvest the full range of visible light photons.
Among a large library of photocatalyst materials, perovskite oxides and their derivatives (layered perovskite oxides) comprise a large family of promising semiconductor photocatalysts because of their structural simplicity and flexibility, good stability and efficient photocatalytic performance. The ideal perovskite has a cubic structure with a general formula of ABO3. The A and B sites can accommodate most of the metal elements in the periodic table into the crystal structure, which thus extends the family of perovskite oxides by rationally combining different metal ions at A and B sites.37 Apart from the ideal cubic perovskite, structural distortion can be induced by multiple metal cation substitutions. Such structural distortion can inevitably change the physical, electronic and photocatalytic properties of pristine materials. In addition, a series of layered perovskites consist of infinite 2D slabs of the ABO3 structure which are separated by embedded blocks (metal oxides). The possibility of preparing multicomponent perovskites by either partial substitution of metal cations in A or B sites or inserting metal oxides into a layered structure allows researchers to explore and modulate the crystal structures and the related physicochemical and catalytic properties of the perovskite oxides. To date, more than two hundred perovskites or perovskite-related photocatalysts have been reported, and more importantly some perovskite-based materials have been recorded with “benchmark” performance for photocatalytic applications. Thus, perovskite materials have shown great potential for future applications on the basis of devoting more efforts to them.
Although a number of excellent review articles targeting semiconductor photocatalysts have been published recently,38–41 only a few of them paid attention to inorganic perovskite (mainly ABO3-based) photocatalysts.42–44 A comprehensive classification and full coverage of this material family, for instance, layered perovskite photocatalysts is still lacking. The aim of this review is to summarize the recent development of perovskite photocatalysts for water splitting and environmental remediation, discuss recent findings and advances on perovskite photocatalysts and give a perspective on the future research of perovskites. After a brief introduction on the general structure of perovskite materials, the reported perovskite photocatalysts are summarized, classified and discussed based on photocatalyst preparation, optical properties including the band-gap and band edge position, morphologies as well as the photocatalytic activities of the materials. In order to develop more efficient perovskite photocatalysts, theoretical modelling is a powerful tool to give a comprehensive understanding of the band structure configuration of semiconductors and to predict new semiconductor photocatalysts with promising performance. Some typical examples on the theoretical calculation of perovskite photocatalysts will be illustrated. Finally, a summary will be given to comment on the recent progress and development of perovskite photocatalysts for solar energy utilization. The potential applications, current challenges and the research direction in future will be addressed in the last part. However, the fundamentals on semiconductor photocatalysis and processes in photocatalytic water splitting and environmental remediation will not be covered in this review, since these aspects are already well addressed in the literature.38–41
2. Fundamentals of perovskite materials
2.1 Perovskite structures
The general formula of perovskite-type oxides can be described as ABO3, where the A cation (normally much larger than B) is 12-fold coordinated and the B cation is 6-fold coordinated to the oxygen anions. Fig. 1a depicts the representative coordinated skeleton of the ABO3 structure, which is composed of a three-dimensional framework of corner sharing BO6 octahedra and an A cation at the centre. In the ABO3 structure, the A cation is normally an alkali or alkaline earth metal or a rare earth element, while the B cation is typically a metallic transition metal element. An ideal ABO3 perovskite has a cubic crystal structure with a tolerance factor (t) = 1, which is defined as t = (rA + rO)/√2 (rB + rO), where rA, rB and rO are the ionic radii of A, B and oxygen elements, respectively.37 For composing a stable perovskite, it is normally accepted that the t value should lie between 0.75–1.0. A lower t value (<1) produces a slightly distorted perovskite structure with orthorhombic (Fig. 1b) or rhombohedral symmetry. The ideal cubic perovskite structure only exists in limited cases where t is very close to 1 and often at high temperatures. Although the t value, determined by the ionic size, is an important index for the stability of perovskite structures, the octahedral factor (u) u = rB/rO and the contribution of the chemical nature of A and B atoms, such as the coordinating number of the constituent elements, need also to be considered.45 Taking into account those influencing factors and the electroneutrality, the ABO3 perovskite can accommodate a wide range of pairs of A and B with the same or different valences and ionic radii. Furthermore, either A or B cations can be partially substituted by the other dopants, to extend the ABO3 perovskite into a broad family of AxA1−x′ByB1−y′O3±δ. The substitution of multiple cations into the A- or B-sites can alter the symmetry of the pristine structure and hence the physicochemical and catalytic properties. In particular, the change in electronic and optical properties has a great influence on the photocatalytic process.

2.2 Layered perovskite related structures
In addition to the general ABO3 structure, other typical polymorphs of the perovskite structure are Brownmillerite (A2B2O5) and K2NiF4 structures. Brownmillerite is a kind of oxygen deficient perovskite, in which the unit cell is composed of ordered BO6 and BO4 units. Due to the oxygen deficiency, the coordination number of A-site cations decreases to eight. The structure of oxygen deficient perovskite will be discussed in the next paragraph. The K2NiF4 structure is a combination of oxygen defects and ordered B sites, which is well studied as a superconducting material. The K2NiF4 structure consists of the KNiF3 perovskite unit and the KF rock salt unit. Because the rock salt unit is embedded in the c-axis direction, K2NiF4 materials exhibit layered properties. Based on the intergrowth of different numbers of KNiF3 and KF units, there are many structures that can be classified as {100}, {110} and {111} layered perovskites according to the layered orientation relative to the principal axis of an ideal cubic perovskite. The general formula for the most well-known layered perovskite oxides is described as (Bi2O2)(An−1BnO3n+1) (Aurivillius phase), An+1BnO3n+1 or A2′An−1BnO3n+1 (Ruddlesden–Popper phase) and A′[An−1BnO3n+1] (Dion–Jacobson phase) for {100} series, (AnBnO3n+2) for {110} series and (An+1BnO3n+3) for {111} series. In these structures, n represents the number of BO6 octahedra that span a layer, which defines the thickness of the layer. Representative examples of these layered structures are shown in Fig. 1c–g. For Aurivillius phases, their structures are built by alternating layers of [Bi2O2]2+ and pseudo-perovskite blocks. Bi2WO6 and BiMoO6 (n = 1), found as the first ferroelectric Aurivillius compounds, recently have been intensively studied as visible light photocatalysts. For Ruddlesden–Popper phases, their structures result from the intergrowth of perovskite ABO3 and A′O as the intermediate spacing layer. These compounds possess interesting properties of magnetoresistance, superconductivity, ferroelectricity and catalytic activity. Sr2SnO4 and Li2CaTa2O7 are the examples of simple Ruddlesden–Popper type photocatalysts. The Dion–Jacobson phases with a general formula of A′[An−1BnO3n+1] (n > 1), where A′ separates the perovskite-like blocks and is typically a univalent alkali cation. The representative Dion–Jacobson type photocatalysts are RbLnTa2O7 (n = 2) and KCa2Nb3O10 (n = 3). Members of the AnBnO3n+2 and An+1BnO3n+3 structural series with different layered orientations have also been identified in a number of photocatalysts such as Sr2Ta2O7 and Sr5Ta4O15 (n = 4).
2.3 Defects in perovskites
Perovskite (ABO3) materials have three different ionic species, making for diverse and potentially useful defect chemistry. In addition to the partial substitution of A and B ions allowed while preserving the perovskite structure, deficiencies of cations at the A-site or of oxygen anions are frequent. By substitution of parent cations with similar-sized cations of different valence, defects can be introduced into the structure. The defect concentrations of perovskites can be controlled and tailored by doping. Oxygen ion vacancies or interstitials can be generated by the substitution of B-site ions with cations of lower or higher valence, respectively, producing compounds of AB(1−x)Bx′O3±δ. A common oxygen deficient perovskite structure is Brownmillerite (A2B2O5), in which one-sixth of oxygen atoms are removed. A-site vacancies can be introduced by the substitution of A-site ions with cations of higher valence, giving compounds of stoichiometry of A1−xAx′BO3. The substitution of A-site ions with lower-valence cations results in oxygen vacancy formation giving compounds of A(1−x)Ax′BO3−δ. B-site vacancies in perovskite oxides are not as common as they are not thermodynamically favoured because of the large charge and the small size of the B cations. A-site vacancies are more observed because the BO3 array in the perovskite structure forms a stable network, the large A cations at 12 coordinated sites can be partially missing. Recently, introducing appropriate defects onto the surface of metal oxide semiconductors has been intensively studied as a means of altering the electronic structures and optical absorption properties of the parent materials. For example, hydrogenated TiO2 (black TiO2) has been reported as an efficient photocatalyst that can split water under UV or visible light irradiation.23 From this point of view, perovskite materials provide a huge platform for defect engineering to change the photocatalytic properties of perovskite photocatalysts.
3. Perovskite materials for photocatalysis
A wide range of perovskite photocatalysts have been developed for water splitting and organic pollutant degradation under UV or visible light irradiation during the past few decades. These representative examples and brief experimental results on them are summarized according to their structures, which can be classified into five groups. Specifically, ABO3-type perovskites, AA′BO3, ABB′O3 and AB(ON)3-type perovskites, and AA′BB′O3-type perovskites are listed in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3, respectively.

3.1 ABO3 type

3.1.1 Tantalates. 
NaTaO3 has long been recognized as an efficient UV-light photocatalyst for overall water splitting.46–57 It has a band gap of 4.0 eV and can be synthesized by solid-state,46–48,53,56 hydrothermal,49,52,54,55 sol–gel50,51 and molten salt methods.57 As a first example, Kato and Kudo reported highly efficient splitting of pure water into H2 and O2 over the NaTaO3 photocatalyst. The quantum yield of the NaTaO3 (0.05 wt% NiO as a co-catalyst) photocatalyst prepared by the solid-state reaction method was 28% for water splitting at 270 nm.46–48 In order to increase the surface area of NaTaO3 bulk particles, many researchers attempted to use other synthetic routes to prepare nano-sized particles as an extension of the study on the NaTaO3 photocatalyst. Kondo et al. synthesized a colloidal array of NaTaO3 nanoparticles using three-dimensional mesoporous carbon as a template, which was replicated by the colloidal array of silica nanospheres. After burning out the mesoporous carbon matrix, a colloidal array of NaTaO3 nanoparticles with a size of 20 nm and a surface area of 34 m2 g−1 was obtained. Compared to non-nanostructured bulk NaTaO3 particles, the nanostructured NaTaO3 exhibited more than 3 times higher photocatalytic activity for overall water splitting.54 Shortly afterwards, Shi and Li et al. developed a fast and facile method for the preparation of NaTaO3 nanocrystals via a microwave-assisted hydrothermal process.55 An indirect transformation route from Ta2O5 to Na2Ta2O6 and to NaTaO3 was proposed as the main reason for that pure NaTaO3 could be synthesized in a rather short time (less than 3 h) under mild conditions. The water splitting efficiency of NaTaO3 nanocrystals prepared by this approach was more than two times higher than that prepared from conventional hydrothermal synthesis. Recently, the nano-sized NaTaO3, prepared by an exo-template method with a crystallite size of about 25 nm, showed an 18 times higher hydrogen evolution rate than NaTaO3 synthesized by a solid-state reaction method (Fig. 2).56 The hydrogen production activity of NaTaO3 obtained from the exo-template synthesis could be further improved by about 30–40 times by mixing with reduced graphene oxide and using Au as a co-catalyst. However, it did not show the improvement of activity for NaTaO3 prepared from solid-state reaction under identical conditions.

In addition to the nanostructure engineering of NaTaO3, much effort has been made to achieve a higher activity of NaTaO3 by doping with lanthanide58–66 or alkaline-earth cations.67 Kudo et al. found that the photocatalytic activity of NiO-loaded NaTaO3:La was 9 times higher than that of the non-doped sample.58,59 The maximum apparent quantum yield of the NiO/NaTaO3:La photocatalyst reached 56% at 270 nm (highest record). It was explained that La doping reduced the particle size of NaTaO3 from 2–3 μm to 0.1–0.7 μm and created an ordered surface nanostructure with many characteristic steps, which accounts for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. The bulk recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes was less in smaller particles with high crystallinity. In addition, the back recombination of H2 and O2 was inhibited because of the effective separation of the reaction sites for H2 and O2 evolution. Afterwards, La-doped NaTaO3 powders with high surface area and good crystallinity were prepared using a microwave irradiation method61 and a H2O2 assisted sol–gel route.65 The highest H2 production rate of 2.86 mmol h−1 g−1 was obtained for a 2.0 mol% La-doped sample from a 10% methanol solution.65 In addition to La-doping, Kudo et al. also systematically investigated the effect of alkaline earth metal ion dopants (Ca, Sr and Ba) on water splitting with NaTaO3 powder.67 Interestingly, doping of Ca, Sr and Ba can also create surface nanostep structures on doped NaTaO3 when the amount of dopants was larger than 0.5 mol%. The formation of a nanostep structure could dramatically enhance water splitting efficiency. However, both positive and negative effects existed for Sr-doping as proved by photoluminescence measurements. A small amount of Sr dopant enhanced charge separation, whereas a large amount of Sr dopant created a significant amount of defects as recombination centers. These studies demonstrated that doping of La and alkaline earth metals is a useful approach for suppressing electron–hole pair recombination by reducing the particle size of NaTaO3 as well as forming a surface nanostep structure, however the concentration of dopants needs to be considered for maximizing the photocatalytic performance.
Recently, a major research topic on NaTaO3 is trying to extend the absorption spectrum of NaTaO3 into visible light by doping of metals such as Ta4+,68 Cr,69 Eu,70 Bi,71–73 Mn and Fe,74 and non-metals such as N,75 C,76 or co-doping of La/Cr,77,78 La/N79 and N/F.80 The doping mechanism on band gap narrowing of NaTaO3 is generally accepted that d orbitals of metal elements and s or p orbitals of non-metal elements contribute some intermittent energy levels within the band gap of NaTaO3, which are mainly determined by Ta 5d and O 2p orbitals.74 For example, Chen et al. prepared 5% Bi-doped NaTaO3 powders by solid-state reaction by varying the ratio of Na/Ta in starting materials.71,72 They have found that the Na/Ta molar ratio strongly influenced the doping sites of Bi in the lattice of NaTaO3 and optical and photocatalytic properties. The visible light absorption of Bi-doped NaTaO3 prepared under mild Na-rich conditions was extended up to 550 nm, because Bi dopants were located both at Na and Ta sites. As a result, this sample was the most active one for the degradation of methylene blue under visible light irradiation compared to others prepared under Na-deficient or strongly Na-rich conditions. Although doping of metal or non-metal elements into NaTaO3 (likewise doping of TiO2) can be realized by various synthetic methods, it is worth mentioning that Cao and Hu et al. developed self-doped (Ta4+) NaTaO3 nanoclusters by a facile one-pot low-temperature solvothermal method.68 Compared to foreign element doping, the self-doping method benefits from a more homogeneous feature. Furthermore, low-temperature synthesis avoids the increase of the particle size and aggregation during prolonged high temperature synthesis. Doping of Ta4+ greatly reduced the band gap of NaTaO3 from 3.94 eV to 1.70 eV as indicated by the reddish colour of the doped NaTaO3 sample. In addition, Zhou and Li et al. theoretically calculated the band structures of Mn and Fe-doped NaTaO3 and they found that Mn-doped NaTaO3, with a band gap of 2.82 eV, was only active for the photo-oxidation of water. Fe-doped NaTaO3 (2.03 eV) was capable of overall water splitting.74
Following the early studies on NaTaO3, other tantalate photocatalysts including ATaO3 (A = Li and K) and AgTaO3 were also reported. Kudo et al. compared the alkali tantalate ATaO3 (A = Li, Na and K) photocatalysts for water splitting under UV-light irradiation.47 The ilmenite LiTaO3 photocatalyst showed higher activity than NaTaO3 and KTaO3, when no co-catalyst was employed. However, in the presence of a NiO co-catalyst, NaTaO3 exhibited the highest activity and the activity of the NiO/NaTaO3 was enhanced by 1 order of magnitude compared to the pure NaTaO3. Furthermore, the activity of KTaO3 could be enhanced by Zr-doping as an acceptor. The Zr dopant plays the roles of reducing the charge density in the sample and increasing the lifetime of photoexcited charges.81 Shortly afterwards, they also found that AgTaO3 (3.4 eV) can split water with or without co-catalysts under UV-light irradiation.82
Tantalate-based perovskite oxides are considered as a group of promising UV-light photocatalysts with wide band gaps. The band structures are mainly determined by Ta 5d and O 2p orbitals, whereas the A site cations (A = Li, Na, K and Ag) have little effect. Through nanostructure engineering and doping modification, the photocatalytic performance of the parent tantalates could be dramatically enhanced, as demonstrated by the fact that the apparent quantum yield of La-doped NaTaO3 (with NiO co-catalyst) reached 56% at 270 nm.58,59 In addition, doping of tantalates with appropriate metals or non-metals makes them active under visible light.68–80


3.1.2 Titanates. 
SrTiO3, one of the earliest studied perovskite photocatalysts, has a band gap of 3.2 eV and suitable band levels for water splitting. A SrTiO3 single crystal was found to generate H2 from highly alkaline conditions ([NaOH] > 5 M) under UV-light illumination.83,84 The hydroxide ions at or near the photocatalyst surface were suggested as facile hole acceptors to increase the lifetime of electrons for proton reduction. Reduced Ti3+ surface species were found on the illuminated crystal surface, which might be involved in the production of H2 under UV-light illumination. Almost simultaneously, Domen et al. also reported the photocatalytic splitting of water vapor on NiO (1.7 wt%) loaded SrTiO3.85 Later on, they found that liquid water splitting was 3 times faster than water vapor splitting with the NiO/SrTiO3 photocatalyst.86 The NiO loading was crucial for the significant enhancement (100 times) of the water splitting performance. Through further study of the structure of the NiO co-catalyst,87 it was revealed that a core/shell structure was formed on the surface of SrTiO3 during the pre-treatment process (Fig. 3). The NiO on the surface of SrTiO3 has undergone a reduction and re-oxidation process forming a Ni/NiO core/shell structure. The Ni metal in contact with SrTiO3 was important for the photocatalytic activity. On the other hand, the NiO in the outer layer was partly changed to Ni(OH)2 during the reaction with water under irradiation. This work reminds us that the co-catalyst engineering (e.g. structure, morphology, distribution and composition tuning) is also vitally important to enhance the photocatalyst performance.

These early studies have demonstrated that SrTiO3 is an excellent material for water splitting under UV-light irradiation. Recently, various nano-structured SrTiO3 particles with high surface area were prepared by hydrothermal88–91 or sol–gel92 methods to improve the performance. For example, single-crystal-like porous SrTiO3 nanocube assemblies were prepared via a facile hydrothermal reaction at 150 °C using layered protonated titanate hierarchical spheres of sub-micrometer size as a precursor template.90 The hierarchical 3D assemblies were formed by oriented stacking of SrTiO3 nanocubes of 60–80 nm, as a result of topographic transformation in crystallography between the layered titanate and perovskite structure as well as Ostwald-ripening assisted oriented attachment. Similarly, single-crystal-like mesoporous SrTiO3 sub-micrometer spheres with a wormlike structure were synthesized by a hydrothermal method using polyvinyl alcohol as an additive.89 Despite the well-documented roles in nanoscale engineering of solid photocatalysts, Osterloh et al. have observed that the activity for overall water splitting of SrTiO3 decreases from 28 μmol H2 per g per h (bulk SrTiO3) to 19.4 μmol H2 per g per h (30 nm SrTiO3), and 3.0 μmol H2 per g per h/(6.5 nm SrTiO3).93 The reasons for this decrease were ascribed to an increase of the water oxidation overpotential for the smaller particles and reduced light absorption due to a quantum size effect. They suggested that the catalyst particles based on SrTiO3 should be larger than 30 nm for overall water splitting under UV-light irradiation. The controversial results on the nanoscale engineering of solid photocatalysts should be considered in future studies.
Recent studies on SrTiO3 are concentrated on doping SrTiO3 for achieving visible light activity. Doping of single metal elements such as Cr,94,95 Fe,96 Mn,97 Ir,97 Ru,97 Rh,97 Er,98 Zn99 and Ti(III),100,101 and non-metal elements such as N102 and F103 as well as co-doping of Cr/Sb,104 Cr/N,105 Cr/Ta,106 Cr/La,107 La/Ni,108 S and C,109 N/La,110 Ni/Ta111 and La/Rh112 have been intensively investigated for showing photocatalytic activities under visible light irradiation. Among the different noble metal ions, Rh ion was the best one than the others like Ru and Ir. The donor level located at ca. 1.0 eV above the valence band was formed by Rh3+ doping, which behaved as a visible light absorption centre and a surface reaction centre for oxidation of methanol (hole scavenger).97 Later on, Cr-doped SrTiO3 was also evaluated for photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. The Sr0.95Cr0.05TiO3 sample prepared by the hydrothermal method extended its visible light absorption up to 540 nm and exhibited 3 times higher activity than that synthesized by solid-state reaction due to the increased surface area.95 Note that the Cr3+ substitution of Ti4+ sites in SrTiO3 would create oxygen defects and/or generate Cr6+ ions to keep the charge balance, which may increase the recombination between photogenerated electrons and holes. The positive doping effect for Cr3+ was suggested only for the substitution of Sr2+ sites in SrTiO3. Recently, La and Rh co-doped SrTiO3 and Mo-doped BiVO4 powders embedded into a gold layer in a Z-scheme system have been developed for water splitting with a solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of over 1% and an apparent quantum yield of over 30% at 419 nm was achieved. Another important feature is that the photocatalyst sheet is scalable by screen-printing an ink containing the mixed photocatalysts.112 In addition to the foreign element doping, self-doped SrTiO3−x was prepared through a one-step combustion method followed by annealing at high temperatures under an Ar atmosphere.100 The oxygen vacancy played dual roles: enhancing the visible light absorption and chemical adsorption of CO2 onto catalysts, which improved the artificial photosynthesis to produce hydrocarbon fuels from CO2 and H2O as a result of the synergetic effect. However, as observed from Sun's group, oxygen vacancy on the surface of SrTiO3 induced by chemical reduction can only improve the UV-light photocatalytic activity due to the enhancement of charge separation, but it had little effect on the visible light activity.101 In the case of doping of non-metal elements, mesoporous N-doped SrTiO3 was prepared using glycine as both a nitrogen source and a mesopore creator.102 The doped sample has a higher specific surface area (52.3 m2 g−1) with a lower band gap of 2.9 eV, and exhibits excellent activity in photodegradation of dyes.
In contrast to forming donor/acceptor levels within the band gaps through doping of metal or non-metal ions, a series of upconversion luminescent materials (e.g. Er3+ doped SrTiO3 photocatalysts) have been demonstrated to be active for visible light driven water splitting with sacrificial agents.98 The upconversion luminescent agents (e.g. rare earth elements) such as Eu3+, Nd3+ and Er3+ can emit high-energy photons by absorbing two or more low-energy photons. By this approach, visible light photons can be firstly up-converted into UV-light photons so as to excite the large band-gap semiconductors if the upconversion material is properly trapped in the large band gap semiconductor host as shown in Fig. 4.

Other titanates including BaTiO3,113–115 Rh or Fe-doped BaTiO3,116,117 CaTiO3118,119 and Cu,120 Rh,121 Ag and La-doped CaTiO3122 and PbTiO3123,124 were also reported as UV or visible light photocatalysts. It was interestingly found that the Pt loaded CaTiO3 photocatalyst exhibited an enhanced production rate of hydrogen from a mixture of water vapor and methane due to the simultaneous photocatalytic steam reforming of methane and water decomposition.119 The activated methane species or reaction intermediates would accelerate the water splitting or suppress the reverse reaction. This result implies that renewable sources such as methane from biogas can be utilized for producing H2 by photocatalytic steam reforming. BaTiO3, an n-type semiconductor with a band gap of 3.0 eV, was studied by doping Rh species in order to generate a new absorption band in the visible light region. The Rh-doped BaTiO3 powder prepared by the polymerized complex method was examined for water reduction with a sacrificial agent under visible light irradiation.116 Interestingly, the Rh-doped BaTiO3 or SrTiO3 electrode125 generated a stable cathodic photocurrent, in contrast to the anodic photocurrent generated from the un-doped BaTiO3 electrode under UV light irradiation. Thus, Rh-doped BaTiO3 is regarded as a p-type semiconductor, which is rarely observed for doped metal oxides. Similar to the reported Rh-doped SrTiO3, the substitution of Ti4+ sites with Rh3+ ions without forming oxygen vacancies yields positive holes due to the charge compensation and thus changes the semiconducting properties from n-type to p-type. However, it should be noted that doping Rh into n-type oxide semiconductors does not always produce p-type character.
Titanate photocatalysts, represented by SrTiO3 as a prototype perovskite, are attractive in the research field of photo(electro)catalysis. In a similar manner to that employed in tantalate photocatalysts, nanostructure engineering and doping modification are two of the most commonly adopted strategies to improve the photocatalytic performance of titanates. However, the smaller particle size of the solid photocatalyst cannot guarantee higher water splitting efficiency due to the quantum size effect. On the other hand, SrTiO3 is a good candidate for investigating the surface defects related to visible light activity and adsorption properties due to the flexible conversion between Ti3+ and Ti4+.


3.1.3 Niobates. 
Alkaline niobates such as KNbO3 and NaNbO3 have been widely investigated as UV-light photocatalysts. The bulk KNbO3 with a band gap of 3.12 eV was synthesized by hydrothermal reaction under supercritical water conditions in an earlier report.126 By heating at 400 °C, a single phase of K4Nb6O17 was gradually transformed into a single phase of KNbO3 in 24 h. However, the mixed phases of K4Nb6O17 and KNbO3 were found to be more photoactive for water splitting than pure K4Nb6O17 and KNbO3 under UV-light irradiation. Nano-structured KNbO3 with different morphologies of nanowires, nanorods, nanocubes, nanocrystals and microcubes can be prepared by hydrothermal synthesis,127–133 which basically involves the hydrothermal treatment of a mixed aqueous solution of KOH and Nb2O5 at about 180–200 °C in an autoclave for several hours. The variation of hydrothermal parameters such as the temperature, reaction time, pH of solution and concentration of precursors changes the morphologies. For example, cubic, orthorhombic and tetragonal KNbO3 microcubes were prepared by varying the ratio of KOH and Nb2O5 in a precursor solution.129,130 The cubic KNbO3, with a relatively larger BET surface area and band gap compared to the tetragonal and orthorhombic samples, exhibited the highest H2 production rate. At the same time, Yi et al. proposed a dissolution–recrystallization mechanism to explain the formation of the corresponding nanostructures.131 In addition, gold nanoparticle deposited KNbO3 microcubes were prepared for utilizing visible light induced surface plasmon resonance effects on gold nanoparticles.132 N-doped KNbO3 nanocubes with a band gap of 2.76 eV were prepared and tested for water splitting with sacrificial agents under visible light.133
Compared to KNbO3, NaNbO3 showed a relatively lower photocatalytic activity probably because of its relatively larger band gap.134,135 However, an interesting phenomenon was found that the KNbO3 film exhibited photoinduced hydrophilicity under UV-light irradiation, even though the photocatalytic oxidation of the dye by the KNbO3 film was negligible.136 Normally, photoinduced hydrophilicity was observed for the TiO2 film because of the photocatalytic decomposition of organic compounds re-generating a hydrophilic surface. These results confirm that photoinduced hydrophilicity was not caused solely by the photocatalytic oxidation. In addition, N-doped NaNbO3137,138 and Ru-doped NaNbO3 nanocubes and nanowires139 were also reported for the photocatalytic decomposition of phenol and 2-propanol under visible light irradiation.
In contrast to the alkaline niobates, AgNbO3 has a smaller band gap of about 2.8 eV and can be prepared by solid-state, sol–gel, solvothermal and molten-salt flux techniques.140–143 For example, a polyhedron-shaped AgNbO3 photocatalyst with surface nanosteps was prepared by a solvothermal method.142 The well-defined edges and corners on the polyhedron-shaped AgNbO3 were found to be able to enhance its photocatalytic activity, in a similar manner to that observed on La-doped NaTaO3. Likewise, the formation of a 20–50 nm terraced surface microstructure was also observed on the AgNbO3 nanoparticles synthesized by molten-salt flux, whereas there was no well-defined morphology and microstructure for the sample prepared from solid-state synthesis.143 In order to further enhance the photocatalytic activity of AgNbO3, La-doped AgNbO3 was prepared by a solid-state reaction method.144 The Ag0.88La0.12NbO3 sample showed a 12-fold higher rate for photocatalytic decomposition of gaseous 2-propanol under visible light irradiation. The enhanced performance was assumed to be due to several possible reasons such as the enlarged surface area, enhanced mobility of photo-generated electrons, deposition of metallic silver and A-site defects in the perovskite structure.
Recently, nonstoichiometric Sr1−xNbO3 (x = 0.1–0.2) has been reported as a novel metallic visible light photocatalyst by Irvine et al.145,146 A series of strongly coloured red materials with a band gap energy of 1.9 eV were obtained by controlling the nonstoichiometry in the perovskite (Fig. 5). The band structures of metallic oxide conductors are assumed to be different from semiconductor oxides, in which the valence and conduction bands are clearly distinguished. For metallic Sr1−xNbO3, it was described that the band below the conduction band as the highest fully occupied band (B−1) and that above it as the lowest unoccupied band (B1), respectively. Therefore, photon excitation by visible light might be involved either from B−1 to the conduction band or from the conduction band to B1. The high conductivity of the sample might allow the fast separation and mobility of charge carriers. As a result, Sr0.9NbO3 showed the highest efficiency for H2 or O2 evolution from a sacrificial aqueous solution.

Niobate perovskite photocatalysts are less studied than those tantalate and titanate-based photocatalysts, probably because of their relatively lower activities and stabilities. Most of the studies on alkaline niobate photocatalysts are focused on the preparation of nano-structured niobates with different morphologies.127–133,140–143 In an exceptional case, nonstoichiometric Sr1−xNbO3 (x = 0.1–0.2) has been demonstrated as a novel metallic visible light photocatalyst,145,146 which opens up a new research direction in searching for visible light photocatalysts.


3.1.4 Ferrites. 
Magnetic BiFeO3, known as the one of the multiferric materials in magnetoelectric applications, was also studied as a visible light photocatalyst for water splitting and degradation of organic pollutants due to its small band gap (ca. 2.2 eV). Both BiFeO3 nanoparticle powders and films were prepared for evaluating their photo(electro)catalytic performance.147–156 In an early report, BiFeO3 with a band gap of about 2.18 eV synthesized by a citric acid assisted sol–gel method has shown its visible light photocatalytic activity by the decomposition of methyl orange dye.147 The following studies on BiFeO3 are mainly focused on the preparation of novel structured BiFeO3 with different morphologies. For example, Lin and Nan et al. synthesized BiFeO3 uniform microspheres and microcubes by a controlled hydrothermal method as shown in Fig. 6.150 The band gaps of BiFeO3 materials were estimated to be about 1.82 eV for BiFeO3 microspheres and 2.12–2.27 eV for microcubes. The clear shift for the absorption edge among these samples was influenced by the particle size, morphology and crystal-field strength. The microcube sample exhibited the highest efficiency for the photocatalytic degradation of congo red dye under visible light irradiation because of the relatively larger band gap. Later on, a facile aerosol-spraying approach was developed to prepare mesoporous BiFeO3 hollow spheres with enhanced activity for the removal of RhB dye and 4-chlorophenol, due to enhanced light absorbance resulting from multiple light reflections in a hollow chamber and a higher surface area.148

In addition, a remarkably enhanced water oxidation activity on Au nanoparticle loaded BiFeO3 nanowires under visible light irradiation was reported.154 The Au–BiFeO3 hybrid structure was induced by the electrostatic interaction of positively charged BiFeO3 nanowires and negatively charged Au nanoparticles at pH 6.0 according to their different isoelectric points. An enhanced absorbance between 500 and 600 nm was observed for Au/BiFeO3 samples due to the typical Au surface plasmon band in the visible light region. The amount of O2 produced from Au/BiFeO3 nanowires with 1 wt% Au loading was 30 times higher than that from parent BiFeO3 nanowires during the first 4 h reaction. More interestingly, a synergistic effect was found between the Au nanoparticles and the BiFeO3 nanowire support, as the photocatalytic activity of self-assembled Au/BiFeO3 nanowires was much higher than the composite of Au and BiFeO3 nanowires. The photoluminescence study suggested the occurrence of efficient charge transfer from BiFeO3 to Au, which explained the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity. In addition, Ba, Ca, Mn and Gd doped BiFeO3 nanofibers and nanoparticles have shown obvious room temperature ferromagnetic behaviours and photocatalytic activity for the decomposition of dyes.157–161
Various nanostructured LaFeO3 with different morphologies such as nanoparticles, nanosheets, nanotubes, nanorods, and nanospheres have also been prepared as visible light photocatalysts for water splitting and degradation of organic dyes.162–170 Other ferrites like PrFeO3,171 SrFeO3172,173 and GaFeO3174 were reported as novel visible light photocatalysts. Particularly, GaFeO3, with a band-gap of 2.7 eV, exhibited an attractive overall water splitting activity without any co-catalyst loading from pure water. The hydrogen and oxygen yields were about 10.0 and 5.0 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light irradiation.
Considering the ferroelectric and magnetoelectric properties of ferrite materials, it is more attractive to develop multifunctional photocatalysts as demonstrated by the study of BiFeO3 and LnFeO3, even though their photocatalytic activities are not as good as their counterparts such as titanate and tantalate perovskites. For example, ferroelectric BiFeO3 has recently been used in photovoltaic devices for coupling of light absorption with other functional properties.175,176


3.1.5 Others. 
Other perovskites such as BaZrO3,177–179 Mg, Ta-doped BaZrO3,180,181 MSnO3 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba)182–186 and BaCeO3187 were barely studied as UV-light photocatalysts with relatively large band gaps of over 4.0 eV. Among them, SrSnO3 nanorods prepared by the hydrothermal method exhibited much better photocatalytic water splitting performance.183 The hydrogen and oxygen yields with Pt-loaded SrSnO3 in the sacrificial systems were 8200 and 2500 μmol g−1 h−1 under UV-light irradiation, respectively. In addition, LaCoO3,188–190 C, Fe-doped LaCoO3191,192 and LaNiO3193,194 are active for the photocatalytic degradation of dyes and water splitting under visible light irradiation.

3.2 AA′BO3 type
The substitution of an A ion in ABO3 by an A′ ion with a different valence state will alter the valence state of the B metal ion or induce some defects and oxygen vacancies into the structure, which would significantly influence optical and photocatalytic activities. Thus, this strategy offers us more options to design new perovskite photocatalysts by rational combination of dual metal ions with consideration of the charge balance. For illustration, sodium bismuth titanate (Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3) has been widely used for piezoelectric, ferroelectric and pyroelectric devices. It was also studied as a UV-light photocatalyst with a band gap of ca. 3.0 eV.195–197 Hierarchical micro/nanostructured Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 was synthesized by in situ self-assembly of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 nanocrystals under controlled hydrothermal conditions, during which the growth mechanism was studied in detail.195 It was proposed that the hierarchical nanostructure was built through a process of nucleating and growth and aggregation of nanoparticles and subsequent in situ dissolution–recrystallization of the microsphere nanoparticles with prolonged heating time and increased temperature or basic conditions. The 3D hierarchical Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity for the removal of methyl orange dye due to the increased surface area and adsorption of dye molecules. The activities of Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 were also evaluated by photocatalytic production of H2 from water and removal of nitric oxide in the gas phase.196,197 Another example is that K-doping in the Na1−xKxTaO3 photocatalyst transformed the distorted perovskite NaTaO3 to a pseudo-cubic phase, which significantly promoted the photocatalytic water splitting activity.198 In terms of the crystalline structure, approximately 180° (a value ideal for the delocalization of the excited energy in tantalates) Ta–O–Ta bond linkage caused by K-doping facilitates the separation of photogenerated charges as to enhance the photocatalytic activity. La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, as a visible light photocatalyst, was investigated for solar photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange.199 In addition, La0.5Ca0.5NiO3,200 La0.5Ca0.5CoO3−x201 and Sr1−xBaxSnO3 (x = 0–1)202 nanoparticles were prepared for showing enhanced photocatalytic degradation of dyes.
3.3 ABB′O3 type
In a similar manner to A-site substitution, B-site substitution by a different cation is another option for tuning the physicochemical or photocatalytic properties of perovskites. KTaO3 is well known as a good UV light photocatalyst for water splitting. Ishihara et al. systematically investigated the effect of doping a series of cations (Zn2+, Y3+, Al3+, Ga3+, In3+, Ce4+, Ti4+, Zr4+, Hf4+, Si4+, Ge4+, Nb5+, Sb5+ and W6+) to substitute Ta in KTaO3.203 It was found that 8% doping of Zr4+ exhibited the highest rate for water splitting under UV-light irradiation. The increased activity was proposed to the enhancement of the lifetime of photoexcited charge due to the decreased charge density. Later on, they further combined KTa(Zr)O3 with various organic dyes for water splitting in a Z-scheme system.204 The cyanocobalamin sensitized K0.95Ta0.92Zr0.08O3 exhibited the highest photocatalytic water splitting efficiency with a formation rate of 575.0 and 280.4 μmol g−1 h−1 for H2 and O2, respectively. The enhanced charge transfer mechanism on the porphyrinoid modified K0.95Ta0.92Zr0.08O3 was further studied by photoluminescence spectroscopy in detail as shown in Fig. 7.205 Unlike dye sensitization, photo-excited electrons transferred from K0.95Ta0.92Zr0.08O3 to dyes and Z-type excitation was successfully achieved. The photogenerated charges were spatially separated between KTa(Zr)O3 and Cr-TPP dye as in a photosynthetic system. This work shows great promise for organic–inorganic hybrid Z-scheme systems for water splitting, compared to all-solid-state Z-scheme systems.

Another series of M(NxNb1−x)O3, (M = Ca, Sr and Ba; N = Co, In and Zn) solid solution samples were synthesized by solid state reaction and their performance was evaluated for water splitting under UV-light irradiation.206–211 Among these different compositions, BaZn1/3Nb2/3O3 seemed to be the most active photocatalyst for pure water splitting and generation of H2 from a methanol containing aqueous solution under UV-light irradiation. Raman spectra indicated that different binding modes of M–O–Nb may be the dominant factors in the migration of photogenerated charge carriers and affecting the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, highly electronegative non-transition metal Pb or Sn ions were incorporated into the perovskite lattice of (BaIn1/3M1/3M1/3′)O3 (M = Sn, Pb; M′ = Nb, Ta).212,213 The Pb-containing quaternary metal oxides Ba(In1/3Pb1/3M1/3)O3 possess a much narrower band gap of ca. 1.50 eV when compared to those of the ternary oxides Ba(In1/2M1/2)O3 (2.97–3.30 eV) and the Sn-containing Ba(In1/3Sn1/3M1/3)O3 derivatives (2.85–3.00 eV). These results provided a new method of developing efficient visible light photocatalysts by doping electronegative non-transition metal cations.212 In addition, A-site strontium based perovskites such as SrTi(1−x)FexO3−δ, SrTi0.1Fe0.9O3−δ, SrCo1/2Fe1/2O3−δ, and SrNb1/2Fe1/2O3 compounds were synthesized through solid-state reaction and sol–gel methods, and were investigated for the degradation of dyes under visible light irradiation.214–218 Another group of A-site lanthanum based perovskites such as LaNi1−xCuxO3 and LaFe1/2Ti1/2O3 were demonstrated as efficient visible light photocatalysts for the generation of H2 from HCHO aqueous solution and degradation of p-chlorophenol under visible light irradiation.219–221 The other ABB′O3 type photocatalysts including Ba(ZrSn)O3,222 Ca(TiZr)O3,223 Bi(MgFeTi)O3,224 Na(BiTa)O3,225 Na(TiCu)O3,226 and Ag(TaNb)O3227 have also been reported.
Compared to AA′BO3 type perovskites, the ABB′O3 type structure provides more flexibility in composing the perovskite photocatalyst, because normally the B-site cations in ABO3 mainly determine the level of the conduction band, in addition to build the framework of perovskite structure with oxygen atoms. The band structures of photocatalysts can be finely tuned by rationally combining dual or ternary metal cations at the B-site, or varying the ratio of multiple cations, which has been well demonstrated by the examples given above. Further investigations on ABB′O3 type photocatalysts are expected to explore their new exciting photocatalytic performance.
3.4 AB(ON)3 type
In addition to A- or B-site doping, nitridation of perovskite oxides to form oxynitride-type perovskite AB(ON)3 is another effective approach to reduce the band gap of ABO3 and enhance the photo(electro)catalytic performance under visible light. Since the N 2p orbitals can introduce new intermittent energy levels above the valance band edge constructed by O 2p orbitals, most of the AB(ON)3 materials have strong visible light absorption up to 600–650 nm. The development of oxynitride photocatalysts successfully makes visible light driven water splitting possible at an irradiation wavelength of over 600 nm. For example, LaTiO2N developed by Domen and co-workers has been studied as a visible light photocatalyst for water splitting.228–234 It has a band gap of 2.1 eV and exhibits both photocatalytic H2 and O2 evolution from a sacrificial aqueous system under visible light irradiation up to ca. 600 nm.229,230 By loading LaTiO2N with a CoOx co-catalyst, the O2 evolution efficiency can be greatly enhanced.228,231 However, it shows a relatively lower activity for H2 evolution even with a Pt co-catalyst. The infrared spectroscopic analysis suggests that photoexcited electrons in LaTiO2N cannot efficiently transfer to the Pt co-catalyst.232 It was thought that LaTiO2N prepared by the nitridation process may contain a lot of defects, especially in the surface region, which would prevent the charge transfer at the interfaces between the photocatalyst and co-catalyst. Recently, eliminating such surface defect layers on LaTiO2N with appropriate acid etching gave rise to significant improvements in the photocatalytic activity for both H2 and O2 evolution reactions.233 Furthermore, the LaTiO2N powder can be fabricated into a photoanode for photoelectrochemical water splitting.235–240 The LaTiO2N photoanode decorated with IrO2 co-catalysts exhibited a markedly improved anodic photocurrent based on water oxidation.
Tantalum or niobium oxynitride series (ABO2N, A: Ca, Sr and Ba; B: Ta and Nb) are other successful examples that can generate H2 or O2 from aqueous sacrificial solution under visible light irradiation up to ca. 600 nm. In the case of ATaO2N, the band gaps decrease with increasing radius of alkaline-earth metals with 2.5, 2.1, 2.0 eV for A = Ca, Sr and Ba, respectively.241 Only H2 was produced from an aqueous methanol solution with these photocatalysts, while no O2 evolved even from the silver nitrate solution. Thus, ATaO2N is usually used as a H2 production photocatalyst in a Z-scheme water splitting system.242,243 Recently, doping of pentavalent W-species into BaTaO2N significantly improved the activity for O2 evolution from aqueous silver nitrate solution in the presence of an IrO2 co-catalyst.244 The optimum ratio of W/Ta = 0.005 was found for the O2 evolution. Since the W-doping did not largely alter the band gap structure of BaTaO2N, a plausible explanation for the enhanced oxidation of water was proposed to the pronounced upward band-bending, because holes in the valence band are able to migrate easily to the surface according to the upward band-bending. The BaTaO2N fabricated photoanode can achieve water splitting under visible light irradiation up to a 660 nm wavelength. The IPCE value was estimated to be about ca. 10% at 1.2 V vs. RHE under 600 nm, which is the highest record among the photoanodes excited beyond 600 nm for water oxidation.245 Niobium-based oxynitrides generally have much smaller band-gaps than the corresponding tantalum analogues. The band-gaps of ANbO2N are 2.0, 1.8, 1.7 and 1.6 eV for A = Ca, Sr, Ba and La, respectively.246 However, only CaNbO2N is photoactive for H2 and O2 evolution under sacrificial conditions. SrNbO2N powder showed a weak photocatalytic O2 evolution activity even in the presence of silver nitrate, but generated an anodic photocurrent due to the water oxidation upon irradiation with visible light photons up to 700 nm, even without an externally applied potential.247 Under visible light irradiation with an applied potential of 1.0–1.55 V vs. RHE, stoichiometric H2 and O2 evolution was achieved on the SrNbO2N electrode decorated with a colloidal IrO2 co-catalyst.
The nitridation approach can efficiently narrow the band gap of ABO3 oxide and increase the capability of visible light absorption, and thus has been widely employed for developing new materials in both photochemical and photoelectrochemical systems. The development of nitridized materials is indeed a great success in extending visible light response of the photocatalysts and photoelectrodes. However, it is not faultless. Nitridized materials suffer from stability challenge during the water oxidation process, as the nitrogen component would be easily oxidized to nitrogen gas instead of water oxidation.233 Therefore, how to improve the stability of nitridized materials is important and requires further investigation.
3.5 ABO3-A′B′O3(A′B′O2N) type
Because of the high capacity of accommodating a wide range of cations and valences at both A- and B-sites, ABO3 type perovskite oxides are promising candidates for producing solid-solution photocatalysts. In this case, both the A and B cations can be replaced by equivalent cations resulting in a perovskite with the formula of (ABO3)x(A′B′O3)1−x. Since most of the reported visible light photocatalysts are not capable of generating H2 and O2 simultaneously due to the unsuitable band edge positions, it is thus expected that the band structures of solid solution materials can be tuned by combining a H2 evolution photocatalyst and an O2 evolution photocatalyst, in order to achieve the purpose of overall splitting of water on a single-phase material under visible light irradiation.
For instance, SrTiO3 (3.2 eV) and AgNbO3 (2.7 eV) have been reported as H2 and O2 evolution photocatalysts, respectively, due to their different band gap energies and band edge potentials. Ye et al. developed a series of solid-solution samples (AgNbO3)1−x(SrTiO3)x (0 < x < 1), which have shown modulated band structures and enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity.248,249 Rietveld refinement revealed that the perovskite-type solid solutions (AgNbO3)1−x(SrTiO3)x were crystallized in an orthorhombic phase (0 < x < 0.9) or a cubic phase (0.9 < x < 1). (Ag0.75Sr0.25)(Nb0.75Ti0.25)O3 exhibited the best visible light activities for O2 evolution and decomposition of gaseous 2-propanol.
Another example is BaZrO3–BaTaO2N solid solution photocatalysts developed by Maeda and Domen et al.250–253 BaTaO2N with a band gap of 1.8–1.9 eV has been shown as a H2 evolution photocatalyst over 600 nm irradiation. However, the apparent quantum yield is very low (<0.1% at 420–440 nm) in a two-step water splitting process, when combined with Pt-loaded WO3 as an O2 evolution photocatalyst. By composing a solid solution with BaZrO3(4.8 eV), the BaZrO3–BaTaO2N solid solution (Zr/Ta = 0.05) exhibited a much higher activity for H2 evolution in aqueous NaI solution under visible light (>420 nm) than BaTaO2N.250,251 When Pt–WO3 was employed as an O2 evolution catalyst in NaI solution, stoichiometric water splitting into H2 and O2 was achieved under visible light. The apparent quantum yield was calculated to be about 0.6% at 420–440 nm, which was at least six times higher than that obtained with the optimized Pt/BaTaO2N. Furthermore, the BaZrO3–BaTaO2N solid solution has been demonstrated to be active for both photocatalytic water reduction and oxidation under visible light irradiation.252,253 The overall water splitting on the BaZrO3–BaTaO2N based material was also tested in a photoelectrochemical cell system. This is the first single photoanode material with a band gap smaller than 2.0 eV for overall water splitting. It should be mentioned that IrO2-loading is indispensable to achieve stable water oxidation over BaTaO2N-based photocatalysts owing to self-oxidation. When colloidal IrO2 was deposited on the solid solution anode, the anodic photocurrent was significantly improved. In addition, the onset potential was shifted to ca. −0.3 V vs. RHE, indicating that colloidal IrO2 loaded onto BaTaO2N promoted water oxidation, which was consistent with the results of photocatalytic reactions. Recently, Pan and Domen et al. tried to solve the self-oxidation problem by double-coating a mixture of silica and titania layer (SiOxH/TiOxH) on a complex perovskite-type oxynitride, LaMgxTa1−xO1+3xN2−3x (x ≥ 1/3), namely the solid solution of oxynitride LaTaON2 and the complex oxide LaMg2/3Ta1/3O3.254 The amorphous coating layer successfully prevented N2 evolution due to the accumulated hole oxidation of nitrogen species. By employing RhCrOy as a H2 evolution co-catalyst as shown in Fig. 8, TiOxH/SiOxH-deposited LaMg1/3Ta2/3O2N exhibited stable overall water splitting performance at wavelengths of up to 600 nm. However, the quantum efficiency of overall water splitting is still low (ca. 0.03% at 440 ± 30 nm).

Other solid solution samples including CaZrO3–CaTaO2N,255 SrTiO3–LaTiO2N,256 La0.8Ba0.2Fe0.9Mn0.1O3−x,257 Na1−xLaxFe1−xTaxO3,258 Na0.5La0.5TiO3–LaCrO3,259 Cu-(Sr1−yNay)(Ti1−xMox)O3,260 Na1−xLaxTa1−xCrxO3,261 BiFeO3–(Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3,262 and Sr1−xBixTi1−xCrxO3263 have been reported as visible light photocatalysts for water splitting in a sacrificial system and degradation of organics.
In brief, with the hope of increasing the visible light harvesting, charge separation and transfer, and surface photocatalytic efficiency, research on the ABO3 type and modified ABO3 type perovskite photocatalysts has been heavily focused on nanostructuring, morphology control, band-gap engineering by doping of metal and non-metal dopants and forming a solid solution. Among these ABO3-related photocatalysts, La and Rh co-doped SrTiO3 has been demonstrated to be the so far best candidate for hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation as demonstrated by Domen et al.112 On the other hand, ABO2N and its solid solution compounds have been recorded with “benchmark” performance by extending the threshold of excitation wavelength near to 700 nm for water splitting.247 However, the solar energy conversion efficiency and the stability of these nitridized perovskites need to be further improved. Although great progress on the ABO3 perovskite photocatalysts has been achieved during recent decades, considerable research is needed to develop new perovskite-based photocatalysts or to design more efficient composites based on the reported materials.
4. Layered perovskite materials for photocatalysis
In addition to the “ideal” ABO3 and the modified ABO3 materials discussed above, a number of layered perovskite photocatalysts are also reported. According to their structural characteristics, the reported layered perovskite photocatalysts are classified and discussed along with the summary as shown in Table 4.

4.1 Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) phase
In the general formula of the RP phase, An−1A2′BnX3n+1, A and A′ represent alkali, alkaline earth, or rare earth metals while B refers to transition metals. The A cations are located in the perovskite layer and have a 12-fold cuboctahedral coordination to the anions. The A′ cations have a coordination number of nine and are located at the perovskite boundary with an intermediate block layer. The B cations are located inside the anionic octahedra, pyramids and squares. A series of RP-type layered tantalates, A′2ATa2O7 (A′ = H, Li, K and Rb; A = La2/3, Ca and Sr), as well as their hydrated products were presented as UV-light photocatalysts for water splitting.264–268 The band gaps of these RP-type compounds are about 3.9–4.1 eV. The first example of RP-type layered tantalates with a hydrated interlayer, A2SrTa2O7·nH2O (A = H, Li, K and Rb), was prepared by conventional solid state reaction and cation exchange methods.264 Overall water splitting was achieved on H2SrTa2O7·nH2O and K2SrTa2O7·nH2O. The hydrated catalysts showed higher H2 and O2 evolution rates than anhydrous Li2SrTa2O7 and KTaO3. From the study of photoluminescence, they concluded that the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in hydrated tantalates was less. Thus, the photogenerated charges can be more effectively reacted with water to generate H2 and O2. In addition, they further substituted Sr in A2SrTa2O7 with La, and the hydrated A2La2/3TaO7 exhibited higher activity than anhydrous perovskites (KTaO3 and La1/3TaO3).265 The incorporation of Ni(II) species into the interlayer space, as the effective sites for H2 evolution, was found to enhance the photocatalytic water splitting activity. Other tantalates such as K2Sr1.5Ta3O10,266N-alkyl chain grafted H2CaTa2O7,267 Li2CaTa2O7,268 and H1.81Sr0.81Bi0.19Ta2O7269 were studied as UV-light photocatalysts for degradation of dyes.
A2La2Ti3O10 (A = K, Rb and Cs) and doped A2La2Ti3O10 comprise another family of RP-type layered titanates. Domen et al. firstly reported the ion-exchangeable layered perovskites with a general formula of A2−xLa2Ti3−xNbxO10 (A = K, Rb, Cs; x = 0, 0.5, 1) for water splitting.270 As shown in Fig. 9, Rb2La2Ti3O10 showed the highest activity (869 and 430 μmol g−1 h−1 for H2 and O2, respectively) with 4% Ni loading under UV-light irradiation among all of these compositions. A partial substitution of Ti4+ by Nb5+ reduced the number of alkaline metal cations located to keep the charge balance at the interlayer space. As a result, the hydration of the interlayer in Nb5+ substituted layered perovskites was inhibited, which reduced the photocatalytic activity consequently. Furthermore, a K2La2Ti3O10 sample was also prepared by polymerized complex and hydrothermal methods.271,272 The polymerized complex synthesis helps to reduce the calcination time and enhance the purity of the sample. The optimized Ni/KaLa2Ti3O10 prepared by this method was more photoactive than conventional Ni/K2La2Ti3O10 for water splitting, even though they have similar surface areas and band gaps. Later on, a series of Sn, Cr, Zn, V, Fe, Ni, W and N-doped K2La2Ti3O10 samples were prepared to reduce the band gap of K2La2Ti3O10 for performing photocatalysis tests under UV and visible light irradiation.273–278 However, only Sn-doping effectively reduced the band gap of K2La2Ti3O10 from ca. 3.6 eV to 2.7 eV. The band gap of N-doped K2La2Ti3O10 was estimated to be about 3.4 eV. Other RP-type titanates such as Sr3Ti2O7,279 Sr4Ti3O10,280 Sr2SnO4,281 Cr-doped Sr2TiO4,282 Rh and Ln-doped Ca3Ti2O7283 and Na2Ca2Nb4O13284 have also been investigated.

4.2 Aurivillius phase (AL)
The Aurivillius phase is a form of perovskite represented by the general formula of (Bi2O2)2+(An−1BnO3n+1)2−, where A represents the 12-fold coordinated cation with low valence in the perovskite sub-lattice, B denotes the octahedral site occupied by ions with high valence, and n is the number of perovskite layers between the [Bi2O2]2+ layers. Bi2MO6 (M = W and Mo), composed of perovskite-like [MO4]2− layers sandwiched between bismuth oxide [Bi2O2]2+ layers, are the simplest members of the Aurivillius family and the most studied samples in this family. They were firstly reported by Kudo and co-workers for photocatalytic water splitting under visible light irradiation.285–288 Bi2WO6 (2.8 eV) exhibits higher O2 evolution efficiency than Bi2MoO6 (3.0 eV) from aqueous AgNO3 solution under visible light irradiation. Due to the suitable band gap energy, relatively high photocatalytic activity and good stability, Bi2MO6 compounds have been intensively studied as the AL-type visible light photocatalysts. More than one hundred papers related to the Bi2WO6 and Bi2MoO6 photocatalysts have been reported so far. Most of the studies in the literature are focused on the preparation of various nanostructured Bi2WO6 and Bi2MoO6 including nanosheets, nanofibers, hierarchical architectures, ordered arrays, nanoplates, inverse opals, hollow spheres and films etc., by different preparation methods such as hydrothermal, solvothermal, molten salt, electrospinning, microwave and thermal evaporation deposition. The hydrothermal synthetic route has been mostly employed to control the morphologies and shapes of the particles. The photocatalytic activities of these nanostructured materials are mainly evaluated by the degradation of organic pollutants and selective organic transformations. In addition to the studies on the bare Bi2WO6 and Bi2MoO6, doping of Zn, Mo, F, Er, N, Zr, Gd and W into Bi2WO6 and Bi2MoO6 was investigated for improving the photocatalytic behaviour under visible light. A summary of these Bi2MO6 photocatalysts is not given here, since more detailed discussions can be found in several specific reviews.289–292
ABi2Nb2O9 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba and Pb) is another member of the AL-type layered perovskite with n = 2.293–299 PbBi2Nb2O9 with a band gap of 2.88 eV was firstly reported as an undoped, single-phase oxide photocatalyst working under visible light.293 Under visible light irradiation, Pt/PbBi2Nb2O9 gave a QE of 0.95% for H2 evolution from aqueous methanol solution, and a QE of 29% for O2 evolution from AgNO3 solution. However, the other niobates like ABi2Nb2O9 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) have the larger band gaps of about 3.3–3.5 eV.296–299 Under UV-light irradiation, Ag/ALa4Ti4O15 (A = Ca, Sr and Ba) photocatalysts with ca. 3.8 eV of band gaps can reduce CO2 to CO and HCOOH by bubbling CO2 gas into an aqueous suspension of the photocatalyst powder without any sacrificial reagents.300 Among these perovskites, Ag/BaLa4Ti4O15 is the most active photocatalyst. Under specific loading of an Ag co-catalyst on the edge of BaLa4Ti4O15, the main reduction product from Ag/BaLa4Ti4O15 suspension was CO rather than H2. As shown in Fig. 10, it was proposed that the edge and the basal plane of BaLa4Ti4O15 were the reduction and water oxidation sites, respectively. Loading fine Ag particles (10–20 nm) onto BaLa4Ti4O15 by impregnation and H2 reduction or a liquid phase reduction method, CO2 reduction to CO and HCOOH predominated over water reduction to form H2. The stoichiometric ratio of reduction and oxidation products (H2 + CO:O2 = 2:1) suggested that water was consumed as an electron donor for the CO2 production.

In addition to unique magnetoelectric properties, a nanostructured four-layered Bi5FeTi3O15 perovskite with a band gap of ca. 2.1 eV also exhibits visible light photocatalytic activities.301,302 The hydrothermal synthesis can produce nanoplate-based, flower-like hierarchical morphology, and the detailed growth process, from nanonets to nanoplate-built microflowers was revealed. The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared Bi5FeTi3O15 was evaluated by the photodegradation of acetaldehyde and rhodamine B under visible light irradiation.301 By degradation of rhodamine B under solar-light irradiation, the photocatalytic performance of La substituted Bi5−xLaxTi3FeO15 (x = 1, 2) with band gaps of 2.0–2.7 eV was also evaluated.303 Other AL-type compounds such as K0.5La0.5Bi2M2O9 (M = Ta, Nb),304 Bi4Ti3O12,285 BaBi4Ti4O15,285 Bi3TiNbO9,285 Cr-doped Bi4Ti3O12,305 and Bi2ASrTi2TaO12 (A = Bi, La)306 have been studied as UV light photocatalysts for water splitting.
Among AL-type perovskites, only Bi2MO6 (M = W or Mo), PbBi2Nb2O9 and Bi5Ti3FeO15 are active under visible light. Considering the band edge positions, these perovskites are more useful for water oxidation and pollutant degradation owing to the deep valence band positions, whereas their activities for H2 production are much lower even loading with a Pt co-catalyst. PbBi2Nb2O9 is a unique AL-type perovskite that shows a QE of 29% for O2 evolution in 0.05 M AgNO3 solution,293 yet the presence of toxic lead in the compounds is still a concern from the environmental point of view.
4.3 Dion–Jacobsen (DJ) phase
A series of layered lanthanide tantalates and their ion-exchanged compounds with the general formula of A(Lnn−1TanO3n+1) (A = K, Rb, Cs, Ag and H; Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm; n = 2 and 3, respectively) were studied as DJ-type photocatalysts.307–309 The band gaps of these tantalates are in the range of 3.8–4.3 eV. Upon UV-light irradiation, RbNdTa2O7 was firstly demonstrated by Machida et al. for efficient evolution of stoichiometric H2/O2 even without loading metal catalysts.307 Later on, they further investigated the H2 and O2 evolution from MLnTa2O7 tantalates (M = H, Na, Rb and Cs; Ln = La, Pr, Nd and Sm). In the case of M = Rb, the activity follows in the order of Ln: Nd > Sm > La > Pr.308 The effect of Ln was explained from the aspect of the energy level of the Ln 4f bands and the degree of Ln–O–Ta hybridization in the band structure dominated by Ta 5d and O 2p orbitals. Furthermore, they evaluated the effect of ion exchange of interlayer cations (M = H, Na and Rb) on the photocatalytic activities of MLnTa2O7.309 The photocatalytic activity of hydrated HLaTa2O7 was very low regardless of the unchanged band gap energy. The hydrated interlayer would lead to a considerable modification of the valence band structure and the formation of structural defects as evident from the XRD study, which was suggested as the possible reason for the reduced activity. Unlike the hydrated forms of layered perovskites such as K4Nb6O17 and K2La2Ti3O10, which are highly active for overall water splitting, the hydration of MLaTa2O7 may not allow successive photooxidation reactions inside the interlayer. To further elucidate the effect of interlayer hydration, another group of DJ-type tantalates (MCa2Ta3O10, M = Cs, Na, H and C6H13NH3) with a triple-layer structure was synthesized.310,311 In the presence of 0.5 wt% NiOx, the hydrated Na-exchanged phase exhibited an order of magnitude higher activity compared to the anhydrous Cs phase and the hydrous H phase for overall water splitting. While the organic C6H13NH3-intercalated phase was not stable in the photooxidation reactions. The hydrated interlayer was found as the active sites for water splitting by H2O/D2O isotopic experiment. Thus, the effect of hydration, associated with the mobility of water molecules inside the interlayer space, is different among the DJ-type layered perovskites. On the other hand, N-doped CsCa2Ta3O10 with a band gap of 2.0 eV was reported as the first example on the utilization of N-doped ion-exchangeable layered perovskite photocatalysts for water oxidation under visible light.312
In the case of layered niobates with the DJ phase, APb2Nb3O10 (A = K, Rb, Cs and H) was initially studied for H2 evolution from an aqueous alcohol solution.313 The band gaps of most of the layered niobates are wide, however, RbPb2Nb3O10 sheets have an absorption band in the visible light region up to ca. 500 nm with a broad band tail absorption, which may be due to the existence of defects in niobate sheets. RbPb2Nb3O10 was not efficient for H2 evolution under visible light, even loading with a Pt co-catalyst. However, when Rb+ ions were exchanged by H+ ions, the hydrated HPb2Nb3O10 exhibits remarkable enhancement of H2 evolution activity. This enhancement was suggested due to the fast migration of reactants (H2O and CH3OH) into the interlayer space of HPb2Nb3O10. Another series of layered AB2Nb3O10 (A = H, Li, Na and K; B = Ca and Sr) based materials have relatively larger band gaps.314–322 The colloidal KCa2Nb3O10 nanosheet suspension was immediately flocculated when added to an aqueous alkali hydroxide solution. The delaminated nanosheets were restacked together with accommodating alkali metal ions and water molecules between the nanosheets. Such an exfoliation/restacking process generated porous aggregates with a high surface area and enhanced the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution from an aqueous methanol solution under UV-light irradiation.315 Furthermore, by incorporation of RuOx into the exfoliated/restacked material as active sites for water oxidation, overall water splitting with a stoichiometric ratio was achieved upon UV-light illumination.316 Mallouk's group found that the photocatalytic activity of restacked triple-layered nanosheets (HSr2Nb3O10) was an order of magnitude higher than that of the double-layered HLaNb2O7 nanosheets, even though there was little difference in the physicochemical characteristics.320 In addition, they constructed a visible light H2 production system from HCa2Nb3O10 nanosheets utilizing Ru–bipyridine dye as a sensitizer.321,322 Recently, Pt nanoclusters with a diameter smaller than 1 nm were deposited on the interlayer nanospace of KCa2Nb3O10. The Pt incorporated material exhibited an eight-fold greater photocatalytic activity for water splitting than the previous RuO2 loaded sample.317
The interlayer cation effect was also studied by silver-exchange of A-site cations in RbLaNb2O7 and RbA2Nb3O10 (A: Ca and Sr).323,324 The substitution of silver cations into the interlayer spacing of these layered compounds is able to reduce the band gap by about 0.5–1.0 eV. The Ag-exchanged products exhibited significantly improved activity by an order of magnitude than those prior to Ag-exchange for H2 production under UV-light irradiation. The Ag-exchanged RbCa2Nb3O10 with a loaded 1.0 wt% Pt co-catalyst exhibited the highest photocatalytic H2 production rate (ca. 13616 μmol g−1 h−1) from 20% methanol solution under UV-light irradiation, but it was not active under visible light irradiation. Ag+ at the particle surfaces was reduced to Ag particles during prolonged UV-light irradiation, which was one of the reasons for enhanced activities. In addition, hydrated HLaNb2O7 and H1−xLaNb2−xMoxO7 were also studied for H2 production from methanol solution under UV-light irradiation.325,326
4.4 {111} layered perovskites
Layered perovskite A5B4O15 (A = Ba and Sr, B = Nb and Ta) with a plane in parallel with {111} was investigated as a series of UV-light photocatalysts. A Ba5Nb4O15 photocatalyst was firstly prepared by conventional solid-state reaction and polymer-complex methods for water splitting under UV-light irradiation.327 By loading a suitable amount of NiO co-catalysts, Ba5Nb4O15 exhibited remarkably enhanced H2 and O2 evolution rates of 4.8 and 2.4 mmol h−1 g−1, respectively. At the same time, Zhu et al. synthesized monomolecular-layered Ba5Ta4O15 nanosheets with a hexagonal structure by a hydrothermal method.328 The thickness of the nanosheets is ca. 1.1 nm, which corresponds to a monolayer of Ba5Ta4O15. The mono-layered structure of Ba5Ta4O15 facilitates the migration of electron–hole pairs to the sample surface, as demonstrated by the degradation of rhodamine B and gaseous formaldehyde. H2 evolution on the Rh-loaded Ba5Ta4O15 from an aqueous methanol solution was also reported with a rate of 1600 μmol g−1 h−1 under UV-light irradiation.329 After that, the photophysical and photocatalytic properties of Sr5Nb4O15 and Ba5Nb4O15 were compared with La4Ti3O12 and ALa4Ti4O15 (A = Ca, Sr and Ba) layered perovskites.330 Their band gaps are ca. 3.7–4.1 eV. The NiOx loaded BaLa4Ti4O15 and NiOx/Ba5Nb4O15 are the most active photocatalysts for water splitting among the tested titanates and niobates.
Recently, N-doped layered Ba5Ta4O15 and Sr5Ta4O15 were studied for water splitting under visible light irradiation.331,332 N-doping markedly reduced the band gaps from ca. 4.0 eV to 1.78 eV for the doped Ba5Ta4O15 and 2.2 eV for the doped Sr5Ta4O15, respectively. The strong absorption of visible light for the N-doped Ba5Ta4O15 was also demonstrated by the red-shift of the absorption band in the UV-Vis absorption spectrum as shown in Fig. 11.331 For the doped Sr5Ta4O15, both conduction and valence band edges of Sr5Ta4O15−xNx estimated from Mott–Schottky measurements possess sufficient potentials for the respective water reduction and oxidation. This is the first example of nitrogen-doped tantalum-based layered oxide that is able to achieve both the two half reactions of water splitting under visible light illumination.

4.5 {110} layered perovskites
{110} layered perovskite materials have a general composition of AnBnO3n+2 (A = Sr, La; B = Ta, Nb, Ti; n = 4, 5). For example, Sr2M2O7 (B = Ta and Nb) with the perovskite slabs parallel to the {110} face were studied as UV-light photocatalysts.333–337 Lee's group firstly reported Sr2Nb2O7 La2Ti2O7, and La4CaTi5O17 photocatalysts for overall water splitting with maximum quantum yields at 23% for Sr2Nb2O7 in the presence of a Ni co-catalyst under UV-light irradiation.333 The band gaps of these materials are estimated in the range of 3.2–4.3 eV. Among these tested materials, La4CaTi5O17 exhibited the highest H2 evolution rate of 499 μmol h−1 g−1 with 1.0 wt% Ni deposition. Kudo's group examined Sr2Ta2O7 and Sr2Nb2O7 photocatalysts for water splitting and investigated the factors influencing the photocatalytic activity between the tantalates and niobates.337 Sr2Ta2O7 has a wider band gap (4.6 eV) and a much higher conduction band level than that of Sr2Nb2O7 (3.9 eV). In the presence of a NiO co-catalyst, conduction band electrons from Sr2Ta2O7 can easily transfer to the NiO co-catalyst due to the higher conduction band level. Whereas this electron transfer process seems to be hard for Sr2Nb2O7, leading to a significant lower activity for NiO/Sr2Nb2O7. On the other hand, from the aspect of delocalization of electron–hole pairs, the bond angle of O–Ta–O in Sr2Ta2O7 is close to 180 °C in contrast to the twisted Sr2Nb2O7, which promotes the movement of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in Sr2Ta2O7. Solid solutions of Sr2Ta2−xNbxO7 (x = 0–2) were also prepared by different methods and evaluated for their photocatalytic activities.335,336 N-doped Sr2Ta2O7 coupled with graphene sheets has been shown to give increased photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light.338 By specifically loading a Pt co-catalyst onto a graphene support as a solid-state electron mediator, a ca. 80% increase in hydrogen production and a quantum efficiency of 6.45% were achieved.
The La2Ti2O7 family is another group of {110} layered perovskites that has a wide band gap of ca. 3.8 eV.333,339–345 La2Ti2O7 exhibited a QE up to 12% for water splitting with a NiO co-catalyst.333 By doping of different metals such as Ba, Sr, Ca, Cr, Fe and Rh, the band gap of La2Ti2O7 can be reduced and the photocatalytic activities were further improved under UV or visible light irradiation.346–349 Ba-doping gave the largest enhancement on the rate of H2 formation, with a QE = 50% on NiO/Ba-La2Ti2O7 in the presence of a NaOH suspension, which is slightly lower than the best catalyst, La-doped NaTaO3 (56%) in the presence of NaOH.346 Only Cr, Fe and Rh doping can induce intense absorption of visible light, and produce H2 from a methanol solution under visible light irradiation. The origin of the visible light activity was found to be the electron transition from the partially filled 3d bands of Cr3+ and Fe3+ to the conduction band of La2Ti2O7.347,348 Recently, Rh-doped La2Ti2O7 prepared by molten salt synthesis was active under visible light irradiation up to 540 nm.350 Rh3+ doping into the Ti sites of La2Ti2O7 generated electron donor levels within the band gap in analogy with Rh-doped SrTiO3. The visible light activity originated from the electron transition from these Rh3+ donor states to the conduction band, and the oxidized Rh4+ species returned back to their original states via oxidization of CH3OH.
In summary, layered perovskites are usually prepared by solid-state reaction, and the protonated form could be obtained by the acid-exchange method, which has been summarized in Table 4. Layered perovskites are easily transformed into a nanosheet structure via an exfoliation process using tetra(n-butyl)ammonium hydroxide. The exfoliation/restacking process could enhance the surface area of the perovskite materials. The layered perovskites reported so far possess wide band gaps as the common characteristics, which therefore requires band-gap engineering to improve their performance under visible light irradiation. For example, Wang et al. have demonstrated N-doping of the layered perovskites such as CsCa2Ta3O10,312 Ba5Ta4O15331 and Sr2Ta2O7338 successfully reduced their band-gaps to ca. 2.0 eV, however the photocatalytic water splitting performance still needs to be improved. Exceptionally, Bi2WO6 and Bi2MoO6 are the simplest and the most studied visible light photocatalysts in Aurivillius phases.285–288 Many research papers refer to the preparation of novel nanostructures for the applications of water splitting and pollutant degradation. Another key feature of these layered perovskites, especially for the RP-type and DJ-type niobates, tantalates and titanates, is possessing the ion-exchangeable and hydratable capabilities owing to the presence of structural channels in the crystal interlayers. The hydrated photocatalysts generally show better photocatalytic water splitting performance. These interlayer spaces could be utilized for loading co-catalysts as to enhance the distribution of co-catalysts on photocatalysts. By this approach, the water splitting reaction would occur not only on the surface of a photocatalyst, but also possibly in the inner region of a photocatalyst. In addition, compared to the {100} layered perovskites, there are few research examples on {110} and {111} layered perovskites. Among them, NiO/Ba-La2Ti2O7 is one of the most active photocatalysts with a QE = 50%, which is slightly lower than the best La-doped NaTaO3 sample under strong UV-light irradiation.346
5. Theoretical modelling and calculation of perovskite photocatalysts
Compared to binary metal oxides, perovskite and perovskite-related structures with three or more compositions provide a very wide platform to tailor the properties of materials by controlling both the compositions and stoichiometry as demonstrated in the above sections. To rationally design and synthesize perovskite photocatalysts, it is highly necessary to understand the underlying relationships between the composition, structure and performance of materials. Although many modern powerful experimental characterization techniques can provide some insight into the dependence of the physicochemical properties and performance on the compositions and crystal structure of materials, there is still a large gap between them to be bridged by theoretical modelling and calculations. Increasing efforts in this aspect have mainly focused on the theoretical electronic band structures of perovskite materials, which intrinsically control the light absorption, band edges and transport properties of charge carriers and thus reactivity and stability. This consequently deepens the understanding of such dependence at the electronic structure level. The progress of theoretical studies can be roughly divided into two parts. These include the electronic band structures of unmodified and modified perovskite materials and representative results are summarized below.
The band structure of a crystalline material with defined compositions and stoichiometry is sensitive to its phase. A most famous case in the photocatalysis area is anatase and rutile TiO2 showing a band gap difference of around 0.2 eV and remarkably different photocatalytic activity as a result of different crystal structures. A similar phenomenon also exists in perovskite materials. NaTaO3, a very active photocatalyst for overall water splitting under UV irradiation, usually has two different crystal structures of monoclinic P2/m and orthorhombic Pmcn.50,351,352 The band structure and density of states calculated on the basis of the density functional theory (DFT) in Fig. 12 show that both phases have their conduction and valence bands with major Ta 5d and O 2p states, respectively, and the monoclinic phase with an indirect bandgap has a slightly larger bandgap than the orthorhombic phase with a direct band gap.351 A couple of favorable electronic features of the monoclinic phase for photocatalysis include a larger number of effective states available for the photo-induced electrons and holes and a much smaller recombination rate for the photo-induced electron–hole pairs due to the involvement of phonons in the gap transition.50 On the other hand, the nearly linear bond angle of Ta–O–Ta for the monoclinic phase favors the delocalization of the excited energy in tantalate crystals. As a consequence of these favorable electronic and crystal structures together with its large surface area, the monoclinic NaTaO3 crystals prepared by a sol–gel route gave a much higher photocatalytic activity in overall water splitting than the orthorhombic NaTaO3 crystals prepared by a solid-state reaction. Besides these two phases, the third phase of NaTaO3 is cubic. Theoretical electronic structures show that, similar to the monoclinic phase, the cubic phase has an indirect band gap.353 However, its band gap is the smallest among the three phases and smaller by about 0.4 eV than that of the orthorhombic phase. Considering the low recombination probability of the photo-induced charge carriers and a wide absorption range enabled by a small indirect band gap, the cubic NaTaO3 could be a competitive candidate for photocatalytic water splitting and deserves more experimental attention.

The NaNbO3 crystal is another typical ternary perovskite photocatalyst and also gives an obvious phase dependent electronic structure and photocatalytic activity. Both the cubic and orthorhombic phases experimentally and theoretically have indirect band gaps and the cubic phase has a smaller band gap.354 Besides a narrower band gap of cubic NaNbO3, two other electronic structure features favouring photocatalysis were theoretically revealed. These are (1) the more dispersive conduction band gives a smaller electron effective mass and thus favors electron migration; (2) the delocalized orbital at the bottom of the conduction band enables the isotropic transfer of photogenerated electrons along the x, y and z directions. These advantageous features were proposed to be responsible for the higher photocatalytic hydrogen generation of the cubic phase from the mixture of water and methanol than the orthorhombic phase.
The surface structure/morphology of a photocatalyst plays an equally important role in controlling photocatalysis efficiency by modulating surface charge transfer processes between reactant molecules/ions and photocatalysts. Taking NaTaO3 as an example, the stepped-surface structure formed in both La doped and oxygen deficient NaTaO3 was considered to be a key factor for enhancing photocatalytic activity.50,59 The edge and groove of the nanosteps was identified to spatially separate reductive and oxidative sites, respectively. To illuminate the origin of forming such important surface steps, Liu et al. theoretically investigated the influence of oxygen vacancies and La doping on the surface structure of cubic NaTaO3 (the cubic structure was used in order to save computational expense in this study).355 It was found that the La doping at Na sites and oxygen vacancies can result in a similar zig-zag distortion of the original regular flat atom layers in the modified surfaces seen in non-defective surfaces (Fig. 13). The shrinkage and expansion of the lattice parameters in the region neighbouring the La dopant and oxygen vacancies, caused by such zig-zag distortions, was proposed to induce the formation of stepped-surface structures observed in the La-doped NaTaO3 particles and high-T treated non-doped NaTaO3 particles. These findings provide some implications for constructing a desired surface structure at the nanoscale of the photocatalyst by introducing intrinsic defects or heteroatoms.

Compared to the phase dependent photocatalytic activity illuminated above, the trend of the activity change with the compositions of perovskites is much more complex. Many early theoretical studies82,179,182,186,299,356–364 attempted to reveal the underlying relationships between the photocatalytic activity and the compositions of (cubic & distorted) ternary ABO3 perovskites and ordered double A2BB′O6 perovskites in terms of the band gap, mobility of charge carriers and band edges. Eng et al. systematically investigated the electronic structure of d0 (Ti4+; Nb5+; Ta5+; Mo6+; and W6+) transition metal oxides belonging to the perovskite family.356 It was revealed that the band gaps of d0 transition metal oxide perovskites is dependent on the effective electronegativity of the transition metal ion, the connectivity of the octahedra, and the deviation from linearity of the B–O–B bonds. The band gap sensitively increases as the effective electronegativity of transition metal ions decreases (the electronegativity follows the order of Mo6+ > W6+ > Nb5+ ∼ Ti4+ > Ta5+). The transition from the three-dimensional connectivity of the ternary perovskite structure to the isolated electronic structure of the ordered double perovskite increases the band gap by 0.8–1.5 eV as a result of the decreased conduction bandwidth. Distorting the linear B–O–B bonds allows for an increased band gap by up to 0.5 eV due to the narrowing of the conduction bandwidth. In contrast, reducing the dimensionality of the structure from the 3-D connectivity of the ternary perovskite structure to the 2-D and pseudo 2-D connectivity of the layered perovskite phases has a minimal influence on the band gap if the size and shape of BO6 octahedra is retained. In addition, the identity and concentration of inert A ions (A: alkali, alkaline-earth, or rare-earth ions) also has a minimal influence on the band gaps, as also demonstrated in ABi2Nb2O9 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba).299 However, the replacement of these common A ions with Ag+ leads to a great decrease in the band gap of ABO3 due to the formation of a more negative valence band of hybrid Ag 4d and O 2p orbitals than the valence band of dominant O 2p orbitals (for example, AgTaO3 and AgNbO3 have a smaller band gap by 0.6 eV than NaTaO3 and NaNbO3, respectively).82 Similar changes were also observed in layered Dion–Jacobson phases RbLaNb2O7 and RbA2Nb3O10 (A = Ca, Sr) and the Ruddlesden–Popper phase Rb2La2Ti3O10 by using silver ions to exchange ions in the interlayers.325 The knowledge obtained could provide important guidelines for tailoring the band gaps of perovskites by rationally choosing appropriate transition metal ions and controlling stoichiometry.310,365–370
Besides the band gap that controls the light absorption range, the position of band edges, dispersion of band structures and bandwidth are also crucial factors affecting the photocatalytic activity. Their roles were theoretically investigated together with the experimental results in different systems.179,186 For MSnO3 (M2+ = Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+),179 photocatalytic reactions for H2 and O2 evolution in the presence of sacrificial reagents follows the order of CaSnO3 > SrSnO3 > BaSnO3 and CaSnO3 < SrSnO3 < BaSnO3, respectively. The order of H2 generation was consistent with not only that of the conduction-band edges but also with that of the transferred excitation energy, while that of O2 generation was consistent with that of the angle of the Sn–O–Sn bonds as well as the delocalization of excited energy, revealed by theoretical results. Similarly, the activity of photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange with MSnO3 follows the order of CaSnO3 > SrSnO3 > BaSnO3 as a consequence of the dipole moments from the octahedral tilting distortion, widened band gap and increased surface area.371 Yuan et al. proposed that the largely dispersed conduction band, 180° Zr–O–Zr bond angle, and highly negative flat-band potential are responsible for the high photocatalytic activity of BaZrO3 for water splitting.179
Many promising perovskite oxides with a d0 electronic configuration have a large band gap so as to have the ability of splitting water to produce hydrogen and oxygen under UV irradiation only. Attempts containing theoretical studies to address this issue include doping,120,207,214,263,282,305,348,372–390 forming oxynitrides and oxysulfide,359,391–396 introducing intrinsic defects,100,145,146,397–399 and forming solid-solutions.249,258,259,400,401 Early studies mainly focused on doping cations in the B site of ABO3 and derived complex perovskites. ACo1/3Nb2/3O3 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) with a random distribution of Co2+ and Nb5+ in the M site in a charge-balanced manner showed a visible light absorption band.207 The origin of the visible light absorption revealed by DFT calculations is the strong hybridization of Co2+ states with O 2p states to form a more negative valence band. Cr or Fe doping in layered La2Ti2O7 introduced an additional visible light absorption band without changing its intrinsic absorption edge as a result of forming partially filled 3d band in the band gap.348 Similar results were also observed in Cr doped Sr2TiO4.282 Importantly, the substitutional Sc doping for Ti atoms in Sr2TiO4 not only reduced the band gap but also enhanced the dispersion of conduction and valence bands (partially contributed from the generation of O vacancies).382 The DFT calculations of SrTixM1−xO3 (M = Ru, Rh, Ir and Pt) implied that the highest visible light photocatalytic activity of SrTixRh1−xO3 was due to its suitable band energetics, and the induced hybridized Ti/Rh orbitals in the band gap of SrTiO3.214
Anion doping provides a flexible way of modifying the valence band or introducing intermediate band/localized states above the valence band as in the widely studied anion doped TiO2.402 Among all anion doping, nitrogen doping is the most widely used to increase the visible light absorption of perovskites. One advantage is the capability of narrowing the band gap to around 2 eV, an ideal value for fully harvesting the visible light part of the solar spectrum, due to the more negative energy level of the N 2p states than O 2p states. The second is the close ionic radii of O2− and N3− (1.35 Å vs. 1.46 Å) to enable a minimal lattice distortion caused by the substitutional doping of N for O. The third is the experimental feasibility of introducing N into perovskites by heating materials in easily available gaseous ammonia atmospheres. The experimental results indeed demonstrated the effectiveness of nitrogen doping in increasing visible light absorption of wide-bandgap perovskites such as Sr2Nb2O7, La2Ti2O7, SrTiO3, NaTaO3 and Ba5Ta4O15.102,109,273,331,349,372,403–409 Theoretical studies were conducted to understand the mechanism of anion doping in increasing visible light absorption. The mixing of N 2p and O 2p orbitals to elevate the valence band edge was theoretically found to contribute to the band gap narrowing of N doped layered perovskite Ba5Ta4O15.331 The effect of different doping states of nitrogen in La2Ti2O7, a layered monoclinic perovskite, on electronic structure modification was studied.387,389 Only localized states are formed in the band gap when N substitutes O or the substitutional N for O is coupled with interstitial Ti. While the complex of two substitutional N with oxygen vacancies creates a continuum energy band just above the valence band maximum, which is considered to account for the band gap narrowing of N doped La2Ti2O7 obtained experimentally without increasing additional electron–hole recombination centers. On the other hand, by surveying more than 40 models with different ionic states of dopants, the distance between dopants, doping concentrations and the formation of oxygen vacancies, the model with three dispersed substitutional N atoms at O sites and one oxygen vacancy in 87-atom supercell was identified to explain both the shift-up of the valence bands and the narrowed band gap of N-doped La2Ti2O7 observed experimentally.387
Although N doping can effectively extend the visible light absorption range of doped perovskites, two major challenges associated with N doping in oxides include a low solubility of nitrogen in doped materials and charge imbalance between N3− and O2−. They cause an incomplete hybridization of N 2p orbitals with O 2p orbitals, and increased recombination centers of photogenerated electrons and holes, respectively. Co-doping of cation–anion or anion–anion in perovskites was actively pursued and their unique advantages have been demonstrated by synergistically addressing these challenges.376,377,379–381 Nisar et al. showed that, although a respective mono-doping of N and Mo in Sr2Nb2O7 can increase visible light absorption by introducing partially unoccupied states/bands above the valence band or below the conduction band (the left panel of Fig. 14), these states/bands act as the recombination centers of photogenerated electrons and holes.376 Co-doping of N and Mo with a “far” configuration can significantly reduce the band gap by negatively shifting the valence band edge with the newly formed occupied states (the right panel of Fig. 14) as a result of the charge compensation effect between N and Mo. The valence band edge consists of the hybrid N 2p, O 2p, and Nb 4d orbitals and the bottom of the conduction band edge dominantly consists of Mo 4d orbitals. Moreover, the band edges of co-doped Sr2Nb2O7 with a narrow band gap are still suitable for overall water splitting. The role of cation–anion mediated charge compensation in realizing band gap narrowing by removing the localized states of dopants in the band gap was also validated in (V,Nb,Ta)/(N) co-doped La2Ti2O7.380 Furthermore, the stability of the co-doped system is improved due to coulomb interactions and charge compensation effects.

A greatly improved concentration of the nitrogen dopant in oxide perovskites can lead to the formation of corresponding oxynitride perovskites with much narrowed band gaps. Theoretical studies were conducted to understand the mechanism of band gap narrowing in oxynitride perovskites.372,393,396 Ji et al. compared the electronic structures of nitrogen doped Sr2Nb2O7 (Sr2Nb2O5N2) and SrNbO2N.372 As a result of a higher concentration of N in SrNbO2N, SrNbO2N has a much smaller theoretical band gap than Sr2Nb2O5N2 (0.2 eV vs. 2.23 eV). The Ti–(O,N) covalent bonding and the existence of N atoms are responsible for the reduced band gap of the LaTiO2N photocatalyst.393 The valence band edge in oxynitrides is dominantly composed of N 2p states, which have a more negative level than O 2p states. On the other hand, thanks to the rapid increase of computational power, it is possible to make computational screening of a huge number of perovskites affordable.358,359,410–414 This definitely promotes the discovery of new unknown visible light photocatalysts. By screening 19000 cubic perovskites obtained by combining 52 different metals with oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and fluorine as anions, 20 and 12 materials with potential interest for one- and two-photon water splitting were suggested by considering efficient light absorption, suitable band edges for water splitting, and appropriate electron/hole mobility.411 Most of these materials are oxides and oxynitrides. However, further theory calculations of the intermediate energetics for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution, conducted by Montoya et al.,414 suggest that none of the materials proposed above has satisfactory surface chemical properties that should allow for total water splitting in a single material. Therefore, co-catalysts are still necessary to overcome the kinetic limitations for water splitting. Although the surveyed oxysulfides have the same order of magnitude as the oxynitrides as a result of the close electronegativity of sulfur to nitrogen, they show low stability due to a large difference in atomic radius between sulfur and oxygen.
Forming solid solutions, which can be considered as a kind of cation–cation co-doping with a specific molar ratio of two cation dopants, represents an alternative to tuning the electronic band structures of perovskites in a wide range by changing both conduction and valence bands. Many solid solution perovskites such as (AgNbO3)1−x(SrTiO3)x,248,249 NaTaO3–LaFeO3,258 and Na0.5La0.5TiO3–LaCrO3259 show increased visible light absorption due to band gap narrowing. The band gap of a solid solution is usually located between the band gaps of its two pristine components by simultaneously lowering the conduction band edge and elevating the valence band edge. For example, the band structures of AgNbO3, SrTiO3 and solid solution samples are shown in Fig. 15 based on the experimental and theoretical calculation results.248,249 The Ag 4d orbitals move up the valence band edge composed of O 2p orbitals, while the conduction band edge composed of Nb 4d orbitals is more negative than that composed of Ti 3d orbitals. For (AgNbO3)0.75(SrTiO3)0.25 with optimum performance, both the band gap energy and band edge potentials are in the middle of the parent AgNbO3 and SrTiO3, due to the hybridization of (Ag 4d + O 2p) orbitals and (Ti 3d + Nb 4d) orbitals, respectively. However, it should be pointed out that doping introduces trap states in the gap and so can effectively reduce the band gap, which is suggested as an alternative model. The modulated band structure takes advantage of the more negative conduction band edge of SrTiO3 and the less positive valence band edge of AgNbO3. As a result, it gave rise to a significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for O2 evolution and CH3CHO decomposition.

Tailoring intrinsic defects or structures100,397–399 can also modify the electronic structure of perovskites to extend the light absorption range. N-type SrTiO3 with intrinsic oxygen vacancies is a promising photocatalyst for overall water splitting. Different from point defects of oxygen vacancies usually formed in metal oxides, line defects associated with oxygen vacancies along {100} and {001} directions were proposed and created in SrTiO3 with a high concentration of oxygen vacancies (i.e., SrTiO2.75).100 Theoretical results imply that such a line defect creates a fully filled new band composed of Ti d–Ti d bonding states across the vacancy sites in the band gap because of the formation of Ti–Ti bonds in the framework of SrTiO3 with heavy loss of oxygen. The excitation of electrons in the newly formed band to conduction bands is responsible for the additional visible light absorption band. On the other hand, Fu et al. showed that the electronic states induced by the combination of oxygen and strontium atoms on the surface of SrO-terminated nanowires lead to a shift in the conduction band toward the valence band and thus narrow the band gap.397 A similar phenomenon was also observed in CaO-terminated CaTiO3 nanowires.398 It is interesting that the creation of vacancies in the A site can significantly change the electronic band structure of SrNbO3 for a wide absorption range up to 700 nm.145 On the basis of DFT calculations, the origin of the strong visible light absorption band of the metallic Sr1−xNbO3 obtained was proposed to stem from the optical transitions of electrons in the partially occupied band to the unoccupied one above. A systematic theoretical investigation of the electronic structure and optical transition of three typical d1 metallic oxides SrNbO3, SrVO3, and CaVO3 by Zhu et al. indicated that electron direct transition in the visible light region can only occur in SrNbO3 due to the different parity of band edge wave functions as a result of the mixing of Sr d states with Nb eg states.399 Moreover, the large bandwidth of the unoccupied band of SrNbO3 accounts for a smaller effective mass of photogenerated carriers and thus favors the transport of the carriers to surface reactive sites. These features were considered to be the key for realizing visible light photocatalytic activity in such a metallic material.
6. Potential applications
Since the discovery of the photoelectrochemical water splitting phenomenon in 1972, great effort has been devoted to this promising field with the hope of developing new generation and sustainable solar conversion systems that can address the energy and environmental challenges. Fundamentally, how to make better use of the redox power from photo-generated charge carriers (electrons and holes) is the key towards the feasible application of semiconductor photocatalysis. The reduction capability of the photo-generated electrons has been heavily used for water splitting to produce hydrogen and CO2 reduction, while the oxidation power provided by the photo-generated holes or secondary radicals are important for many reactions involving organic decomposition and disinfection processes. Over the past few decades, a vast amount of literature has been accumulated in the research and development sectors towards possible commercialization of the semiconductor photocatalysis technologies, including water splitting for solar hydrogen, organic pollutant degradation in air/water, and solar driven CO2 conversion. Among these demonstrated photocatalysis applications, over half are based on TiO2 photocatalysts.
Compared with TiO2 materials, perovskite photocatalysts have their unique features in terms of tunable compositions, crystalline and electronic/energy band structures, which in some cases lead to more effective photo-induced reduction and oxidation efficiencies. To date, perovskite photocatalysts have been demonstrated to be active in both environmental remediation and solar fuel generation fields. Examples of water splitting for hydrogen fuel generation have been intensively discussed in the above sections and also in the photocatalyst (Tables 1–4). It is important to note that due to the lack of measurement standard, the comparison of solar hydrogen and oxygen yields (Tables 1–4) from one material system to another is not appropriate in many cases. The photocatalyst itself including the amount and form of the sample, the loading of co-catalysts, and reaction conditions such as reactor design and configuration, light sources and reaction solvents (for sacrificial systems) are all playing important roles in determining the photocatalytic water splitting performance. One reasonable way to screen the photocatalyst materials is to use quantum yield (QE). Encouragingly, to date the water splitting QE record is held by a member of the perovskite family, NaTaO3 (56%, under strong UV irradiation), which has also subsequently inspired great research efforts in exploring other perovskite family members with the purpose of improving the QE and better use of visible light, as indicated in Tables 1–4. It is clear that there is still much room for our researchers to work on, if we are set to solve the 10% STH efficiency target in the years ahead. Another even more challenging topic is to use perovskite photocatalysts for CO2 reduction to produce some valuable chemicals but the examples in this field have been quite limited so far.
In the environmental remediation sector, the use of photocatalysts has more diverse options depending on the application purposes. The chemicals in various water sources represent a large group of pollutants that could be potentially decomposed by a photocatalytic process. As listed in Tables 1–4, a number of organic compounds including colourful dyes (MO, MB, RhB, etc.), phenol and its derivatives, pesticides, and acetaldehyde have been used to testify the photocatalytic performance of various perovskite photocatalysts, and some of the systems are working quite effectively. However, for any practically feasible photocatalytic water treatment process, one has to consider not only the photocatalyst itself, but also the reaction kinetics of the organic mineralization, and reactor engineering. The immobilization of particulate photocatalysts in thin films can overcome the challenging photocatalyst recovery issue, while at the cost of reduced surface areas for efficient photocatalytic processes to happen. In the air pollutant removal or self-cleaning coatings sector, predominant work has been done in TiO2 based systems while quite rare examples were demonstrated in the perovskite photocatalyst system.
7. Conclusions and perspectives
Photocatalysis on semiconductor nanomaterials represents a potential strategy to utilize abundant solar energy to tackle the challenging energy and environmental issues that we are facing. Thanks to the continued research efforts for a few decades, semiconductor photocatalysis has seen accelerated development in recent years with an impressive number of >5000 research publications in 2015. Among these, one of the most exciting latest progresses is the perovskite based composite photocatalyst SrTiO3:La,Rh/Au/BiVO4:Mo developed by Domen et al., which exhibited a remarkable solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of over 1%, as briefly discussed above. However, considering the targeted STH efficiency of 10% for the practical application of solar fuels, we still have a relatively long journey to realize our ambition. Likewise, the use of photocatalysis in environmental remediation also has the same challenges, and photocatalytic CO2 reduction, or in other words, artificial photosynthesis, is even more challenging with very low selectivity and conversion efficiency. However, we should bear in mind that our mother Nature has evolved for millions of years to realize the <2% photosynthesis efficiency, and we should have every confidence in achieving commercially feasible solar to fuel conversion efficiency in the years ahead.
From the viewpoint of practical applications, a semiconductor photocatalyst should at least have the merits of high photocatalytic activity, low cost, scalability and long-term stability. In this regard, the selection, design and development of new types of photocatalysts hold the key for sustainable photocatalytic solar energy utilization. Some perovskite photocatalysts have demonstrated their potential for efficient photocatalysis, yet the vast options for material systems represents a huge task for our researchers to conquer. In addition to the conventional “trial and error” approach which has been used by many researchers in photocatalyst development, theoretical prediction and high throughput material genome should provide very powerful tools to guide us for rationally designing better photocatalysts with efficient light harvesting, facilitating charge separation/transfer and appropriate redox power to drive the redox reactions. These new approaches could be particularly suitable to the multi-compositional perovskite material systems. Due to economic concerns, use of rare metal elements should be avoided. Considering that ∼90% of the elements in the periodic table could be included in the generic inorganic perovskite structure, it is recommended to use alkali or alkaline earth metal elements in the A-site and first-row transition metal elements in the B-site to compose the perovskite matrix. Another strategy is to develop new types of double perovskites or triple perovskite photocatalysts as demonstrated from the reported literature. Facet control, surface decorations, conceptual Z-scheme design, band structure alignment and interfacial engineering on the perovskite photocatalysts can also be critically important towards efficient photocatalysis, which are worth further investigating.
In addition to the material development discussed in this article, other aspects in the whole photocatalysis processes are equally important. This includes the fundamental understanding of the photocatalysis process and products by using advanced in situ characterization, the design of photoreactors which can allow better sunlight utilization, efficient mass transfer for the reactants to adsorb/desorb on the surface of photocatalysts, and recovery/regeneration of the photocatalysts for long cycle life. Despite decades of intensive research efforts, the standardization of semiconductor photocatalysis measurement and evaluation is still not available to date. While the photocatalysis society will need to work collaboratively to achieve this goal, for our individuals, the use of simulated sunlight, and evaluation of quantum yield in our reported photocatalytic systems will be valuable for our peer researchers to better understand, to compare and to improve photocatalysis systems, thus facilitating knowledge sharing and accelerated progress in this challenging yet highly promising field.
Under the current global climate of having huge demand for developing a sustainable energy supply and environmental solutions, the utilization of solar energy through the photocatalysis process has a bright future for simultaneously addressing the energy crisis and environmental challenges. It is important for our research community to work together not only in the fundamental understanding of better photocatalyst design, but also in the engineering of whole low-cost and scalable photocatalysis processes to achieve sustainable solar utilization systems.
