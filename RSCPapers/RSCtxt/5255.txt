    , Accepted 21st November 2011First published on 6th January 2012AbstractMicroscopic algae occupies every photic niche on Earth and provides an efficient and inherently scalable sunlight energy capture and chemical storage mechanism. However, fuel production from algae remains outside economic viability due to limitations in biomass cultivation and feedstock extraction. In particular, extraction strategies require prohibitive energy inputs to breach the cell wall and separate lipids, while underutilizing polysaccharide- and protein-rich leftovers. Also due to focus on lipids, cultivars become either unstable or unproductive. Meanwhile, recent advances have demonstrated the synthesis of a variety of fuels and other chemicals from sugars and proteins. Here, the energy-efficient deconstruction of algae cell walls, resulting in release of cell contents, is reported. This occurs by dissolution and hydrolysis of wet algae biomass in ionic liquids without acids, bases or other catalysts. Deconstruction reached completion in <50 min regardless of algae species, at 100 to 140 °C and atmospheric pressure. Based on this finding, a simple process that converts wet algae biomass into constituent fractions is proposed and modeled. These results show it is possible to eliminate intensive energy demand currently hindering the economic viability of algae while co-producing sugar and protein feedstocks that tie into emerging fuel and chemical conversion paths.
Introduction
Worldwide energy demand could be satisfied by a mere ∼0.013% of Earth's incident sunlight.1 Therefore, realizing the grand challenge of a sustainable energy mix will likely require scalable sunlight capture, storage and transmission technologies.1,2 Microscopic algae can maintain much higher photosynthetic conversion efficiencies than crop plants 3 and occupy every photic niche on Earth,4 scaling both capture and storage as it reproduces. However, algae-sourced feedstocks remain confined to niche markets: low-volume production of high-value molecules. This market barrier arises from the high cost of biomass cultivation and feedstock extraction, which prevents entry into high-volume, low-cost markets, such as much-needed renewable fuels.5–7 Feedstock extraction is particularly problematic because algae is protected by tough cell walls that require intensive and cost-prohibitive energy inputs or other extreme and environmentally unfriendly conditions to breach.5,6,8,9Cell walls are composite structures of linear and branched polysaccharides, including cellulose. Linear topologies aggregate into microfibrils that form networks with strong semi-crystalline patterns.10 For example, the mechanical strength of bacterial polysaccharide of similar crystallinity measured a toughness of ∼9 kJ kg−1 (ESI text†), approaching that of carbon fibers (∼12 kJ kg−1).11 Some species also have an additional mineral layer, such as silica (e.g. diatoms), further strengthening the cell. As a consequence, extraction alone accounts for 30–50% of the overall biodiesel production cost, which remains 6 to 10-times higher than petroleum-sourced diesel.5,7,12
Existing extraction schemes are not only costly but also underutilize the algae cell. Current strategies focus exclusively on the separation of lipids, while anaerobically digesting polysaccharide- and protein-rich leftover with subsequent biogas combustion. Alternatively, use of leftover as animal feed is perhaps more economical but cannot scale to the production levels required by fuel demand.5 Hence, significant efforts have been devoted to screening oleaginous species13 and coaxing metabolic pathways towards the accumulation of triacylglycerols (energy storage lipids) using strategies such as photo-oxidative stress, nutrient stress and genetic engineering.5,6,13,14 However, these approaches have consistently destabilized cultures and reduced cell productivity,6,13 nullifying gains in lipid yield per cell. Meanwhile, other researchers have demonstrated the chemical and biochemical synthesis of fuels and other useful molecules starting from sugars and proteins. For example, simple sugars were fermented to biodiesel by Escherichia coli;15 various hydrocarbons, alcohols and other useful structures by metal catalysis;16 and to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in organic solvents17 and ionic liquids.18 The latter molecule, a furanic, can be hydrogenated to produce the gasoline-like molecule 2,5-dimethylfuran, or transformed into various other valuable chemicals, including plastics. Also, amino acids from algae protein hydrolysates were converted to C4 and C5 alcohols by genetically-engineered deamination in E. coli.19 Together, these advances could enable the manufacture of fuels and chemicals from algae sugars and proteins as well as lipids, thus utilizing a larger portion of the cell and relaxing the dependence on fragile lipid overproduction. To accomplish this, we require an efficient means of processing algae into its constituents.

Depolymerization of algae cell wall polysaccharides could result in the deconstruction of the cell wall, including the phospholipid membrane, and creation of a cell-free mixture that can be separated into constituent fractions. Depolymerizationviahydrolysis of glycosidic bonds is ubiquitous in both nature and industry (saccharification). However, to become a viable process for algae, hydrolysis must be carried out both energy-efficiently and under conditions mild enough to preserve the chemical integrity of all constituents. For terrestrial plant biomass (e.g. corn stover, switchgrass, soft and hardwoods), lignocellulose hydrolysis to sugars has been carried out in both acidic and basic aqueous slurries at elevated temperatures and/or pressures,20 and in sub- or supercritical water.21 These harsh process conditions were necessary to overcome water-insolubility and recalcitrance of lignocellulose, but demanded large energy expenditures that caused further conversion of sugars into side-products, degrading yields. Binder and Raines remedied this problem with the use of ionic liquids that can dissolve lignocellulose in significant quantities.22,23 They demonstrated the conversion of sugars and furanics in high yields using surprisingly mild temperatures and only atmospheric pressure. Yet, due to the high recalcitrance of lignocellulose, this reaction benefitted from the presence of a strong acid, such as HCl. The presence of acids in the more diverse chemical environment of algae biomass, which also contains significant quantities of lipids and proteins, besides sugars, could catalyze extensive alterations or become consumed in the process. On the other hand, a mild reaction without acids or other additives could enable a very simple and cost-effective process for converting algae, which are not as recalcitrant, into a variety of valuable feedstocks.
The work presented here addresses the absence of an energy-efficient process for converting algae biomass into feedstocks for fuel and chemical production. In what follows, a simple reaction between undried algae and ionic liquid is demonstrated. Several algae species are shown to become quickly solubilized and hydrolyzed, creating cell-free mixtures. A simple process employing this strategy is proposed and modeled. The overall process energy is estimated to be an order-of-magnitude lower than current extraction methods. The net energy gain from algae cultivation to biodiesel is also modeled. Other potential implications for algae-sourced production, including sustainability aspects, are discussed.
Methods summary
In a typical experiment, algae cultures peaked ∼10 days after inoculation in 1 L of standard culture media at adequate temperature, luminosity, and CO2 supply. Culture batches were screened for bacterioplankton contamination. Cells were dewatered by vacuum decantation after 12 h of settling. Recovered cells were washed by three rounds of 10-fold dilution in ultra-filtered and deionized water, followed by centrifugation and removal of supernatant. Final harvested cells had ∼90% water. A flat-bottom, 4-mL glass reaction vial was charged with 1.0 mL of ionic liquid and heated to 110 °C. About 100 μL of harvested cell suspension was added to the reaction vial and hand-tumbled gently for about 30 s, causing water and algae to disperse quickly and uniformly throughout the ionic liquid. The vial was left uncapped at the set temperature for up to 1 h. Reaction aliquots of ∼50 μL were sampled every 2 to 20 min and quickly diluted 5-fold in water to quench the reaction, precipitate any dissolved polysaccharides, and increase contrast for inspection under a brightfield microscope. About 10 to 20 micrographs were recorded at random positions. By the end of the reaction, the vial was allowed to equilibrate with room temperature and the final lysate was extracted with an equal volume of chloroform after hand-tumbling for 1 min and centrifuging to accelerate phase separation. Extract mass spectra were obtained by electrospray ionization time-of-flight (ESI-TOF) and matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) techniques. Unknown identification relied on primary ion peaks and comparison to the LipidMaps library (http://www.lipidmaps.org/).
Results
Algae experiments

          Cells suspended in just enough water (∼90% water) to allow easy pipetting (Fig. 1a and S2–S4†) were mixed with hydrophilic ionic liquids in uncapped 4-mL reaction vials at several temperatures and ratios (Table 1). During the reaction, cells were periodically sampled and inspected on a brightfield microscope. At a 1:10 ratio of Chlorella pyrenoidosa suspension, a species comprising a polysaccharide cell wall (cellulosic algae), to 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]Cl) by volume, cells appeared intact regardless of time when below 80 °C. Approaching 100 °C, after 15 min organelles were altered extensively and a few cells became spherical and devoid of organelles (Fig. S2†). Above 100 °C, >95% of cells vanished within 15 min, indicating successful dissolution. To precipitate cells and enhance contrast for visualization, aliquots were diluted 5-fold in water. However, the complete absence of cells or cell walls, and the presence of cellular debris showed that algae had been lysed. Cellular debris consisted of small dark-green bodies and were accompanied by a change in background hue to light-green, consistent in appearance with free-floating chloroplasts and dispersed chlorophyll (Fig. 1b and S2–S4†). Hence, the reaction degraded both the polysaccharide cell wall and the phospholipid chloroplast membrane, producing a cell-free mixture.

Labels identify major lipid categories. 

          Lysing took longer (∼50 min) for Scenedesmus quadricauda. This species, which is characterized by a silica cell wall (siliceous algae), is often found as colonies of 4 cells and has an elaborate, three-layer cell wall structure with a porous middle silica layer terminating in four cauda (tails), a thick polysaccharide inner layer and an outer pectic layer in a hexagonal pattern 24 (Fig. 1c). Heating in contact with [BMIM]Cl emptied the cell but left the silica middle layer intact, as evidenced by visible cell “outlines” nearly absent of organelles (Fig. 1d). Pores in the silica layer allowed exit of cell contents, necessarily after removal of both outer and inner layers. The absence of chloroplasts outside cells also indicate lysis of their phospholipid membranes and release of chlorophyll, similarly to what was observed in cellulosic algae.

Mass spectra of chloroform extracts of ionic liquid lysates were similar to Bligh & Dyer (B&D)25 extracts, indicating that lipids were not significantly altered by the reaction, and of larger integrated intensities, suggesting higher yields than B&D were obtained (Fig. 1e). Other imidazolium-based ionic liquids were similarly effective lysing agents, and those extracted similar lipid profiles from the same cell batch (Fig. 1f). The only exception was 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, which returned somewhat lower yields. Overall, ionic liquids extracted lipids at higher yields relative to B&D (Fig. 1g). This was expected since B&D extracts across the cell wall using a lipophilic co-solvent and vigorous agitation, similarly to current algae extraction processes.5,6,8,9 In contrast, ionic liquids remove the cell wall and solubilize all cell contents except for lipids, which are nearly immiscible, further aiding in their separation.

Mass spectra primary peak identification spanning m/z = 50–1400 revealed the whole range of lipids expected from algae, including C12 to C20 fatty acids, sterols, glycerophospholipids and glycerolipids (Fig. 1h). When ionic liquids were substituted for water, in otherwise identical experiments, no significant extraction occurred. That is, wet algae samples were repeatedly heat-treated for extended periods both with and without ionic liquids (Table 1). The lack of cell lysing or even wall disruption during these and other controls (Fig. S2 and S3†), and the resulting absence of lipids in the extract phase (Fig. 1h) confirmed the role of the hydrophilic ionic liquids in lysing. Conversely, imidazolium-based, but hydrophobic ionic liquids did not solubilize or lyse, even when most of the water was evaporated (Fig. S5†). Several cellulosic algae species varying considerably in both size and morphology lysed at similar rates (Table 1). Reactions using dewatered samples suspended in the original growth medium (no washing) did not alter the extent or rate of lysis.

Hydrolysis

It is conceivable that lysis occurred merely due to dissolution and softening of the cell wall microfibril network, and not necessarily by subsequent extensive hydrolysis of microfibril polysaccharides. A simple experiment was carried out to distinguish these hypotheses. Here, cells were dried on a microscope slide under gentle heating, forming an adsorbed layer. Then, a ∼230 μm air gap between slide and coverslip was created to allow microscopic visualization during contact with flowing ionic liquid maintained at 120 °C. Cells were rapidly dissolved (<1 min), as cell wall boundaries became undistinguishable, but did not lyse, as evidenced by organelles remaining inside the cell (Fig. 2). The absence of chemical alteration in dry ionic liquid is consistent with cellulose dissolution work by others.26 The necessary presence of water for lysis indicates a hydrolysis reaction.

The fast rate of hydrolysis without acids or bases suggest the ionic liquid itself is acting as both solvent and catalyst. In nature, glycosidases must also solvate polysaccharides (by local adsorption) and catalyze glycolysis to impart oligomerization.27 This may provide a valid analogy for ionic liquids. Specifically, inverting glycosidase mechanisms depend on the formation and stabilization of dissociated water forms as enzyme adducts that act as Lewis acid and base in a coordinated attack on the glycosidic bond. In the ionic liquid bath, polar water forms are also favored, in this context by the high ionic strength environment. Also, polysaccharides are dissolved effectively in ionic liquids, in this case via the disruption of extensive inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding by the formation of electrostatic bonds to hydroxyl hydrogens with greater stability due to the high dipole moment of the ionic pair.28Hydrogen bonding across glycosylated monomers are equally disrupted, weakening the polymer chain. Given these considerations, a simple mechanism consistent with all observations is proposed (Fig. 3). If correct, the mechanistic similarities with glycosidases would be noteworthy considering that ionic liquids are much simpler structures (∼10−1 kDa vs. 102–3 kDa). With greater simplicity comes an inherent lack of biochemical specificity necessary to regulate metabolic pathways in vivo, but also greater robustness and lower synthetic cost. This trade-off makes ionic liquids likely better suited for catabolic-only, ex vivo reactions in biorefinery processes, such as algae extractions.

(a) Two ionic liquid molecules (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride shown) solvate and dissociate a water molecule, further dissociating into one hydronium and hydroxide pair. (b) A third ionic liquid molecule disrupts the hydrogen bond across glycosylated mannose units, solvating one unit (other H–O–H and O–H–O hydrogen bonds are also disrupted and solvated but were omitted for clarity). The stabilized hydroxide anion acts as a nucleophile on the anchoring carbon. A proton is subsequently donated to the bare oxygen intermediate. (c) The glycosidic bond is broken and two mannane fragments are created. Both fragments and water remain solvated. 

Extraction process
Current algae extraction processes consist of mechanical disruption, such as by pressure gradients, followed by lipophilic solvent extraction, and consumes 4–9 MJ kg−1 of biomass under best case scenarios.6,8,9 Alternative methods, such as acoustic modulation, electroporation, steam explosion, and nano-milling,29 merely recast the same inefficient strategies of untargeted energy discharge and mechanical disruption of the cell wall. Pressure gradients, electrical currents, and other forms of untargeted discharge are highly dissipative because cell walls comprise <1% of biomass when dewatered but still wet, and raising this fraction by drying creates an even larger demand due to the very large wetted surface area (∼106 m2 kg−1, ESI text†) and related capillary forces between cells. Since energy demand drives production cost,5,7,12 it is instructive to estimate the corresponding energy consumption of a process centered on the ionic liquid based reaction.
To this end, a simple ionic liquid based process scheme was conceptualized to take wet algae input at 10% (w/w) solids content and deliver outputs of water, lipids, and ionic liquid solubles including sugars and proteins (Fig. 4a). Harvested but still wet biomass flows into a countercurrent heat exchanger. Here, biomass is heated and its water is partially evaporated before entering the ionic liquid charged reactor. Both water and algae are dissolved in the ionic liquid, resulting in hydrolysis and release of algae constituents. An external source supplies the reactor with heat to drive off excess water. Thanks to the negligible vapor pressure of the ionic liquid,30 and the low volatility of lipids, sugars and proteins, water distillation is efficient and results in a relatively pure steam, except for perhaps trace amounts of short-chain fatty acids and other volatile organics. Steam flows back into the heat exchanger, and heat is recovered through condensation and cooling, outputting water that could be recycled back to the pond or photobioreactor.

(c) Some major uses for algae-derived lipids, sugars and proteins towards fuels and chemicals. Chemical and biochemical paths arrows are color-coded. 
An ionic liquid chromatographic step forms a second continuous loop with the reactor. Here, ionic liquid is separated from algae products and recycled back to the reactor. Among the algae products, lipids are not substantially miscible in the ionic liquid and can be liquid-extracted straightforwardly. The soluble fraction can be removed by exploiting the differences in ionic character between solutes and solvent. For instance, ion-exclusion chromatography can effect good separation, as was demonstrated by others.22 This laboratory technique can be recast as a continuous large scale process using a simulated moving bed geometry.31 Unfortunately, these unit operations can be costly and may require dilution ratios large enough to necessitate a post-processing step to re-concentrate sugars and proteins outputs to useful levels. Innovation is much needed on this front.
At steady-state operation, the estimate for energy demand (heat and work) for the entire process, comprising heat exchange, reaction and separation (chromatography), reached ∼0.4 MJ kg−1 of product. Of this amount, ∼0.1 MJ kg−1 is work (electricity) and the rest is heat (for calculation details please refer to ESI text and Table S1†). This result suggests that an order-of-magnitude reduction in algae extraction energy is possible. Interestingly, the energy spent directly on cell wall deconstruction is negligible compared to other processing steps. As for economics, if such a low overall energy is realized, the cost-limiting factor is likely to become the rate of ionic liquid loss. Currently, ionic liquids are shipped at 2 to 10-fold higher prices than common organic solvents. Binder and Raines estimated that ionic liquid recovery losses of <2% are required for a cost-effective lignocellulosic process.22 Reactive losses, or reactions resulting in loss of ionic liquid integrity, could also hamper scale-up. This issue is either mostly unexplored or contentious. For instance, while a recent study has noted carbon–carbon bond formation between the C2 position of the imidazolium ring and the reducing end of cellulose,32 others have not detected such degradation.33
Well-to-station net energy gain
The proposed extraction process was employed in the calculation of the Net Energy Gain (NEG) across the “well-to-station” path. That is, from absorption of solar energy to fuel (Table 2). The NEG is a useful metric for comparing the energy productivities of alternative fuel sources. It is defined as the ratio of created to spent energy over one or several processing steps. Hence, a NEG equal to 1 indicates no net energy gain or loss. The recent analysis by Lardon et al. for biodiesel production by conventional algae cultivation, harvesting, extraction, and lipid transesterification was used as a starting point.8 In their work, both balanced nutrient (Normal) and nitrogen-starved (Low N) aquacultures were investigated, as well as dry and wet extraction alternatives, combining into four distinct algae-to-biodiesel production scenarios. Here, actual reported performances6,9 were included to derive a more accurate range of values for the wet extraction cases. Energy flows for cultivation, harvesting and transesterification were adopted from wet extraction to the present study of algae hydrolysis. Those were combined with the heat and electricity consumptions estimated previously for the ionic liquid based process. The resulting overall NEG was close to unity for dry extraction, and reached 2 to 4 for wet extraction. These figures corroborate the current absence of a compelling energy upgrade path from algae to biodiesel, even though they were predicated on 100% energy extraction from biomass leftovers (oilcake). The same model suggests a NEG of ∼10 for a processing path utilizing algae hydrolysis instead of pressure homogenization with solvent extraction, but no other improvements (Fig. 4b). This theoretical result matches or surpasses Brazil's ethanol production from sugarcane (∼8) 34 with an order-of-magnitude higher annual energy production per surface area.3,35

The first four columns represent balanced nutrient (Normal) and nitrogen-starved (Low N) algae processed via dry and wet extraction. These values include both estimates8 and actual reported performances.6,8,9 Both algae hydrolysis scenarios (ionic liquid based process, last two columns) assume only the extraction heat and electricity are modified by the proposed process. The Net Energy Gain, or NEG, is the ratio of energy production over consumption for each biodiesel production path (a NEG = 1 indicates no production or consumption of energy). The heat and work balance embodied in the NEG differs from a lifecycle analysis in that energy fluxes related to material flows, such as nutrients for algae cultivation and ionic liquid synthesis, were neglected.

Discussion

          Upstream advantages

          Downstream ionic liquid based conversion may also confer significant upstream advantages. In general, mechanical disruption is sensitive to algae species since its performance depends on cell wall strength, cell size and buffer composition, mandating that extraction be tailored to a given species.6,8,9 As a result, algae is typically grown under monoculture conditions using mechanical barriers (e.g. photobioreactors) or extreme aquatic environments (high salinity, low pH, etc) to prevent contamination from airborne invasive species, invariably increasing complexity and cost.13,36 For example, Scenedesmus spp. is a common airborne invader. After contamination, it competes for resources causing a sink in productivity as it cannot be disrupted effectively by mechanical means due to its siliceous wall. Here, cell-free mixture formation from several species, including Scenedesmus quadricauda, demonstrates species-insensitivity and enables the effective processing of mixtures of algae species along with other microorganisms, including those commonly regarded as invasive. Hence, robust cultivation in cheap open ponds could become possible by employing species and culture conditions optimized to the local environment and available resources, instead of having cultivation options limited by the extraction process. In short, decoupling extraction from cultivation could realize parallel and substantial reductions in biomass cost.
Integrated sustainability
The reported reaction could enable an energy-efficient process that requires mostly heat at about 100 °C and atmospheric pressure. Such mild requirements, even at large scales, could be met by cheap local resources, such as low-temperature geothermal or waste-heat from nearby processes. Alternatively, heat and work could also be supplied by other renewable sources, such as thermal solar and photovoltaic collectors of modest relative size. This low requirement, combined with the flexibility of processing algae biomass from multiple sources into multiple feedstocks, lends itself well to integration with other processes. For instance, it is not difficult to envision the implementation of CO2 waste from coal-fired power plants to direct rapid algae growth on cheap open ponds with municipal waste waters, followed by the utilization of waste heat from other processes to power algae harvest and extraction of feedstock that supplies production of hydrocarbons, furanics, pharmaceuticals and several other molecules (Fig. 4c). The overarching concept is to interlink processes with complementary input and output streams in order to minimize the overall environmental impact while maximizing revenues, what others have termed a “smart green grid”.37
Conclusion
This work reports an energy-efficient reaction that creates cell-free mixtures from wet algae biomass, potentially solving the long-standing problem of energy-intensive feedstock extraction currently preventing adoption of algae as a renewable source of chemicals and fuels. Reactions were carried out in hydrophilic ionic liquids at 100 to 140 °C and atmospheric pressure, helping to preserve the chemical integrity of algae constituents, yet returning high rates and yields. This one-step conversion, which does not require acids, bases or other catalysts, permit an inherently simple, compact and scalable process. Here, such a process was conceptualized and estimated to increase the NEG from sunlight to biodiesel from the current 2 to 4, to ∼10 thanks to water-tolerance and frugal energy use, suggesting a significant increase in the economic viability of algae products is possible.
These results are not limited to lipids or biodiesel. The creation of cell-free mixtures makes all algae constituents available and provides starting materials for a wider range of molecules. Notably, this would add tremendous value and flexibility to algae biomass, which will likely prove essential to the economics of modern biorefineries. That is, feedstock flexibility would afford better insulation from price volatility, therefore protecting businesses during scale-up towards low-cost production. Still, reaching materiality will undoubtedly require, at a minimum, parallel breakthroughs in algae cultivation and massive deployment. In this regard, the present results highlight the potential benefits of focusing research efforts towards increasing algae photosynthetic efficiency and total energy density. For example, by engineering chlorophyll antennas with wider absorption bands and carbon-fixation cycles with lower O2 sensitivities.38 Some challenges remain. Nevertheless, algae continues to hold the potential to become a major contributor to sustainable fuels and chemicals as a versatile, land-efficient and carbon-sequestering source.
Materials and methods
Algae preparation
Microscopic algae were grown in laboratory conditions to maintain a controlled source for cells used in all subsequent experiments. Culture batches consisted of 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks with standard culture media (Alga-Gro Freshwater Medium, Carolina Biological Supply Co.) diluted in 1 L of ultra-filtered and deionized water (Milli-DI, Millipore). Broad-spectrum fluorescent light bulbs (McMaster-Carr) placed above and sideways relative to the culture flasks provided continuous illumination for photosynthesis. Each culture flask was capped by a two-hole rubber stopper with glass tubes through each hole. A small air pump connected by flexible Tygon tubing (Saint-Gobain) to one glass tube provided bubbling of ambient air through the culture to deliver sufficient CO2 and maintain cell suspension. The other glass tube had a cotton insert to allow air out while preventing contamination. Cultures were maintained between 25 and 30 °C and greening peaked 1 to 2 weeks after inoculation. Neochloris pseudostigmata was supplied externally in cooled and partially dewatered suspensions. Before harvesting, cultures were inspected under a brightfield microscope (Fisher Scientific) for signs of contamination (bacterioplankton) and discarded accordingly (∼1 out of 10 batches). Cultured algae were allowed to settle in a beaker for 12 h, and supernatant media was removed by vacuuming. Selenastrum capricornutum did not settle appreciably and instead was harvested by gentle centrifugation. Recovered cells were washed by three rounds of suspension in 10-fold ultra-filtered and deionized water by volume, followed by centrifugation and removal of supernatant. Typical yields were ∼1 g L−1 and final harvested cells had ∼90% water.
Lysis experiments
In preparation for each experiment, 50 μL of harvested cells were sampled, diluted 5-fold in water, and inspected under a microscope to: i) certify the absence of fragmentation, and ii) set baselines of cell number density and appearance for a given culture batch. Flat-bottom, 4-mL glass reaction vials (Thermo Scientific) were loaded with 0.50 or 1.0 mL of ionic liquid (IoLiTec GmbH) heated to a set temperature on a custom-made heating block designed to minimize temperature gradients and provide accurate temperature monitoring. Reaction temperatures from 25 to 140 °C were investigated. Harvested cells were added to reaction vials at 1:20 to 1:1 volume ratios and hand-tumbled gently, causing water and algae to disperse quickly throughout the ionic liquid. Reaction vials were left uncapped at the set temperature for up to 1 h. Reaction aliquots were sampled at 2 to 20 min intervals for microscopic visualization. By the end of the reaction, vials were allowed to equilibrate with room temperature. The ionic liquid lysate mixture was extracted by adding an equal volume of chloroform and hand-shaken for 1 min. For control experiments, the lysate–chloroform mixture was vortexed at maximum speed for 2 min. The result was centrifuged at ∼5000 × g for 2 min to accelerate separation. The chloroform extract was kept refrigerated before chemical analysis.
Ionic liquids
The six ionic liquids investigated were purchased from IoLiTec GmbH (Germany). These were four hydrophilic species: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, or [BMIM]Cl; 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, or [EMIM]Cl; 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, or [AMIM]Cl; 1-(2-hydroxylethyl)-3-methylimidazolium chloride, or [HEMIM]Cl; and two hydrophobic species: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, or [BMIM]PF; 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, or [BMIM]TSO. All samples were shipped at >99% purity and were used in experiments without further purification.
Control experiments
None of the following control experiments resulted in lysis or even partial disruption of cells, as evidenced by similar cell densities relative to direct sampling and the absence of cell fragments: i) non-diluted and 10-fold water diluted cells vortexed vigorously in small centrifuge tubes for 4 min, followed by repetitious pipetting through a narrow orifice tip, ii) heating in boiling water for 1 h, and iii) osmotic shock in saturated NaCl solution followed by boiling for 1 h. Sonication in a 80 W unit (FS20, Fisher Scientific) for 20 min in water and water:methanol:chloroform (1:1:2) two-phase solvent managed to disrupt and noticeably fragment ∼50% of cells. Control lipids were obtained by solvent extraction using a standard Bligh & Dyer protocol.25 These extracts were kept refrigerated before chemical analysis.
Microscopic visualization
Reaction aliquots of 50 μL were quickly diluted 5-fold in water to quench the reaction and precipitate any dissolved cells, cell walls, or other water-insolubles out of solution. Dilution also lowered the refractive index of the surrounding medium to enhance contrast. All visualizations were done in a standard brightfield microscope (Fisher Scientific) with resolution ∼0.22 μm. Cell images were recorded blindly at randomized positions throughout the microscope slide to eliminate bias, and subsequently inspected and annotated.
ESI-TOF

Mass spectra were acquired by an electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI-TOF) unit (Q-TOF Premier, Waters Corporation). Samples either in chloroform or methanol were injected at a flow rate of 50 μL min−1 with a mobile phase of acetonitrile, or 1:1 acetonitrile in water. The ion source voltage was set to 3 kV for positive and negative ion acquisitions modes. Also, the sampling cone was at 37 V and the extraction cone was at 3 V. For both modes, the source and desolvation temperatures were maintained at 120 °C and 225 °C, respectively. The desolvation gas flow rate was 200 L h−1. TOF scanning was set from m/z = 100–1400 at 1 s with 0.1 s inter-scan delay using extended dynamic range acquisition with centroid data format. Noise reduction software was applied. Putative identification of unknowns relied on primary ion peaks compared to the LipidMaps library (http://www.lipidmaps.org/).
MALDI-TOF

Mass spectra were also acquired by a matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) unit (Microflex LT, Bruker Daltonics). For sample preparation, one microlitre of chloroform extract was pipetted onto the target plate in triplicate for drying at room temperature. The samples and calibration standard were overlaid with 1 μL of saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (HCCA) solution in 50% acetonitrile and 2.5% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) prepared daily. Ablation and soft ionization was carried out by nitrogen laser (337.1 nm) pulsations at 250 μJ. Detection occurred in linear mode, summing over 500 laser pulsations in both positive and negative ion reflector modes. The acceleration voltage was set to 25 kV, giving good resolution over a m/z range between 50 and 1400. Bruker Daltonics proprietary noise reduction software was applied. Putative identification of unknowns relied on primary ion peaks and comparison to the LipidMaps library (http://www.lipidmaps.org/).

            . (a, b) Chlorella pyrenoidosa. (a) Intact. (b) after 10 min in [BMIM]Cl at 120 °C (run #6). (c, d) Scenedesmus quadricauda. (c) Intact. (d) after 50 min in [BMIM]Cl at 130 °C (run #13). Lower-right bar measures 10 μm. (e) Mass spectra (ESI-TOF) of chloroform-extracted lysate of Chlorella pyrenoidosa reacted in [BMIM]Cl for 15 min at 120 °C compared to a Bligh & Dyer extract of the same cell batch. (f) Mass spectra (ESI-TOF) of chloroform-extracted lysates of Chlorella vulgaris reacted in four hydrophilic ionic liquids for 30 min at 140 °C. (g) Averaged and normalized yields for each ionic liquid, Bligh & Dyer, and water-substituted control. Error bars indicate the standard error. Ionic liquid structures are depicted. (h) Mass spectra (MALDI-TOF) of chloroform-extracted lysate of Neochloris pseudostigmata reacted in [BMIM]Cl for 20 min at 120 °C and in boiling water for 1 h. Labels identify major lipid categories.

Putative mechanism of glycosidic bond 
hydrolysis
 in ionic liquid. Reacting structures, mannane polysaccharide and water, are shown in blue. (a) Two ionic liquid molecules (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride shown) solvate and dissociate a water molecule, further dissociating into one hydronium and hydroxide pair. (b) A third ionic liquid molecule disrupts the hydrogen bond across glycosylated mannose units, solvating one unit (other H–O–H and O–H–O hydrogen bonds are also disrupted and solvated but were omitted for clarity). The stabilized hydroxide anion acts as a nucleophile on the anchoring carbon. A proton is subsequently donated to the bare oxygen intermediate. (c) The glycosidic bond is broken and two mannane fragments are created. Both fragments and water remain solvated.

 process, well-to-station net energy gain and feedstock uses. (a) A schematic of the entire process from pond or photobioreactor to feedstock output streams. The algae hydrolysis process is marked by a gray box and linked to the dewatered algae source by wet algae input and water output (recycle). The main unit operations of countercurrent heat exchanger, hydrolysis reactor, and ionic liquid chromatography are shown. Heat, work, and material flows are indicated. (b) Residual net energy gains (NEG) for alternative paths from algae cultivation to transesterification into biodiesel (Table S2†). Both “Wet” and “Dry” paths relate to continuous mechanical disruption and lipid solvent extraction best cases. “Hydrolysis” represent the ionic liquid based process, but keeps currently-used algae cultivation, harvest and transesterification steps. (c) Some major uses for algae-derived lipids, sugars and proteins towards fuels and chemicals. Chemical and biochemical paths arrows are color-coded.
