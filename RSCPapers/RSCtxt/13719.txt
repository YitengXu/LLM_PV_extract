        Phase-pure, single-crystalline, monodispersed sphalerite CuInSe2 lamellar nanoplates were synthesized by a novel, green, ambient pressure solution chemical synthesis using ethylenediamine-assisted triethylene glycol solvent. The lamellar nanoplates were used to prepare ethanol-based colloidal inks and then deposit highly (112) oriented chalcopyrite thin films by ink dip-coating and subsequent annealing.
I–III–VI group chalcopyrite compounds, typically CuInSe2 (CIS) and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS), are leading candidates as light-absorbing semiconductors for thin film solar cells due to their unique combination of optical and electric properties, such as direct band gap, strong optical absorption, high quantum efficiency and long-term excitation stability.1,2CIS-based solar cells with oriented polycrystalline structure have demonstrated nearly 20% solar energy conversion efficiency, the highest record for any polycrystalline thin film devices.3 Recently, there have been increasing efforts in developing non-vacuum, solution based methods to fabricate thin film solar cells in order to decrease the fabrication cost and environmental pollution, in which an ink-coating technique has been proposed.4–6 The preparation of suitable nanocrystals and its colloidal inks is an essential strategy for the scalable ink-coating process to develop low-cost thin film solar cells. Up to now, various solution chemical processes have been developed to grow CIS nanoparticles with spherical or near spherical shapes, such as solvothermal growth,7–9 microwave-assisted syntheses,10 molecular single-source precursor synthesis,11 organic compound decomposition synthesis,12,13 and coordinating and noncoordinating solvent syntheses.4,14–16 Recently, the CIS nanocrystals with non-spherical shapes have also been reported, such as CIS nanorings and trigonal pyramidal nanocrystals prepared in oleylamine solvent.5,17 However, the synthesis of CIS nanocrystals with unique shapes and improved dispersivity is still a challenge for both basic research and especial application purposes by now.
Tailoring the preferred orientation of CuInSe2 based thin films is of great interest for understanding of basic light active layer properties. This is particularly important because oriented plane surfaces mean that the heterojunction that forms the active device primarily involves the plane surfaces. It has been known that the lowest surface energy planes on chalcopyrite CIS are the {112} planes.18 The low surface energy of the close-packed polar {112} planes could be explained by surface reconstructions,19 charge compensation either by cation-on-cation antisites, cation vacancies, Se adatoms, or Se addimers.20 The process that forms the heterojunction for the photovoltaic device strongly prefers these surface features with low surface energy because it effectively passivates dangling bonds on the surface and unpins the Fermi energy level. A number of thin film deposition have demonstrated predominantly preferred orientation of CuInSe2 based thin films, such as (220)/(204) orientation in the record-efficiency CIGS solar cells,3 (112) orientation in physical vapor deposition,21,22 sputtered epitaxial films23–27 and spin coated Cu–In naphthenate decomposition and selenization28 of high efficiency CIS-based solar cells. Nevertheless, there is so far no report on preparation of the oriented CIS thin films by solution chemical nanocrystal ink processing. Here, we present an approach for tailoring highly (112) oriented chalcopyrite CIS thin films from stable colloidal ink consisted of monodispersed, single-crystalline and near-stoichiometry sphalerite CIS lamellar nanoplates (NPs) with high diameter–thickness ratio. The thin films were prepared by dip-coating with NP ethanol-based colloidal ink and annealing in Ar atmosphere at 500 °C for 20 min. The CIS NPs were synthesized by a novel, green, ambient pressure solution chemical synthesis using ethylenediamine-assisted triethylene glycol solvent at an injection temperature of 210 °C and copper chloride, indium chloride and selenium powder as precursors (see the ESI† for detail).

Fig. 1 presents basic structural characterization data for the synthesized CIS NPs. The X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 1(a)) shows that the synthesized CIS NPs have cubic sphalerite structure (δ-CIS) in good agreement with the simulated sphalerite pattern due to no chalcopyrite characteristic peaks of (101), (103) and (211) planes.5 When the XRD pattern is indexed with the tetragonal unit cell, the lattice parameters are a = b = 0.5802 nm and c = 1.1591 nm. The ratio of lattice constants (c/2a) as the tetragonal distortion factor is 0.999, mostly equal to 1, strongly indicating cubic sphalerite tendency. Actually, crystal structures of the CuInSe2 semiconductor are closely related to the zinc blende structure, common to III–V and II–VI group compounds. It can be derived from II–VI groups by substitution of group I (Cu) and group III (In) atoms for group II atoms in the situation of the same selenium atom sublattice where each selenium atom is bonded with two group I atoms and two group III atoms instead of four group II atoms as in zinc blende. When Cu and In atoms are highly randomly distributed in metal atom sites, CIS prefers forming cubic sphalerite structure (δ-CIS). The tetragonal chalcopyrite structure (α-CIS) with space group I2d tends to be formed in the specific metal atom ordering, such as Cu occupying the (0, 0, 0) sites and In occupying the (1/2, 1/2, 0) sites of the metal atom sublattice. The different length between the I–VI bonds and the III–VI bonds results in the tetragonal distortion and the close-packed planes are (111) in the cubic lattice and (112) in the tetragonal lattice. So, the sphalerite structure means that the present solution chemical synthesis induces highly random distribution of Cu and In atoms in metal atom sites due to rapid nucleation and growth during the solution reaction process. Also, it is seen that the ratio of (111) peak height to (220) one is 3.7 in the present diffraction pattern, larger than the conventional value of 1.96 for powder diffraction, clearly displaying the preferred orientation of CIS NPs along with the (111) plane. The chemical composition of the sphalerite NPs is analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and has a Cu/In/Se molar ratio of 0.98:1:2.02, nearly stoichiometry of 112 phase (Fig. 1(b)). Fig. 1(c) and (d) show the NPs growing appearance with different magnification, showing monodispersed, lamellar plate-shaped CIS nanocrystals and the diameter range of NPs is 200–300 nm. The inset of Fig. 1(c) shows the thickness of ∼30 nm of a nanoplate with a diameter of ∼300 nm, the corresponding diameter–thickness ratio is ∼10. Fig. 1(e) shows the HRTEM image of a nanoplate, displaying that the nanoplate is a single-crystalline structure and an interplanar distance of 0.204 nm for the (220) planes of sphalerite CIS. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern with incident electron beam perpendicular to the NP surface, the inset in Fig. 1(e), shows single-crystalline diffraction spots with typical hexagonal symmetry for the face-centered cubic lattice, demonstrating that the CIS NPs are {111} orientation of the cubic sphalerite structure. The band gap energy of the sphalerite NPs is determined to be 1.08 eV by the Tauc's relation (Fig. 1(f)), which is consistent with the report of ref. 1 for δ-CIS.

Fig. 2 reveals that TEM images of the sphalerite CuInSe2 resultants synthesized with different injection temperatures of 210 °C, 230 °C, 250 °C and 270 °C for 20 min, respectively. It is seen that the injection temperature of 210 °C and 230 °C led to lamellar shaped sphalerite NPs. NPs derived from 230 °C show a more regular edge profile with hexagonal and triangular facets than one from 210 °C and a similar geometric size with the sample from 210 °C. The TEM image of the NPs derived from 250 °C shows a mixed morphology of CIS nanoplates and nanoparticles with smaller size, and the image of the NPs derived from 270 °C shows more nanoparticles mixed with nanoplates. The results indicate that the solution chemical synthesis with ethylenediamine-assisted triethylene glycol solvent had rapid chemical reaction characteristics and involved in explosive nucleation and following growth within a refluxing time of 20 min to form synthesized resultants. The explosive nucleation and following growth shared all driving forces of the chemical synthesis, i.e. precursor solution supersaturation at certain temperature, for formation of CIS resultants. The single nanoplates, such as that derived from the injection temperature of 210 °C and 230 °C, could be created by a suitable shared proportion of the precursor solution supersaturation, which was strongly dominated by combination of injection temperature with refluxing temperature, to explosive nucleation and following growth. High injection temperatures, such as 250 °C and even 270 °C, assigned more the driving force of chemical synthesis to explosive nucleation by consuming precursors in reaction solution, resulting in a large number of crystal nuclei and further small nanoparticles without power to grow up into nanoplates due to depletion of the precursor solution supersaturation.

The CIS nanoplates were used to prepare the ink-coated films. Thin films were deposited on clean glass substrates using layer-by-layer dip-coating with ethanol solvent ink. The ink-coated thin films were annealed in Ar atmosphere at 500 °C for 20 min (see the ESI† for detail). Fig. 3(a)–(d) show plane-view and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of the CuInSe2 thin films before and after annealing at 500 °C in Ar atmosphere. It is seen that CIS thin films were deposited in a configuration of organization in which the plate surface of CIS NPs is parallel to the substrate surface by the layer-by-layer ink dip-coating, leading to flat and relatively close-packed film morphology both before and after annealing. The side-view FESEM images clearly show the layer-by-layer configuration of organization of CIS NPs during film deposition before and after annealing. The film thickness is obviously changed after annealing at 500 °C in Ar atmosphere and reduced from about 680 nm before annealing to 530 nm after annealing, showing the densification with over 20% shrinkage. Fig. 3(e) shows the XRD patterns of CIS thin films after annealing. It only shows the single characteristic peak at 2θ = 26.6°, strongly demonstrating that the CIS thin film has a preferred orientation along with this direction. The characteristic peak at 2θ = 26.6° can be assigned to the (111) plane for sphalerite structure or the (112) plane for chalcopyrite structure. Close inspection of the XRD pattern further reveals that there is a diffraction peak at 2θ = 27.68°, corresponding to the (103) plane of chalcopyrite structure α-CIS (the inset of Fig. 3(e)), identifying that sphalerite CIS has transformed into chalcopyrite structure by annealing at 500 °C. So, it is concluded that the characteristic peak at 2θ = 26.6° is (112) plane diffraction of α-CIS. The result means that phase transition from δ-CIS to thermodynamically stable α-CIS occurred by ordered lattice arrangement at metal atom subsites during the annealing in Ar atmosphere, which is favorable for photovoltaics. The band gap energy of the annealed CIS thin film is 1.04 eV by the absorption spectrum applied to the Tauc's relation (Fig. 3(f) and the inset), which is in good agreement with that of the chalcopyrite CIS bulk material. The value of the optical gap of the chalcopyrite thin films (∼1.04 eV) is slightly smaller than that of the sphalerite nanoplates (∼1.08 eV). It can be attributed to the bond-length alternation among copper atoms, indium atoms and their neighboring selenium atoms which has an electronic effect of reducing the band gap energy to the compound with the chalcopyrite structure, relative to that of the sphalerite structure with identical chemical composition, because the latter has a disordered cation sublattice. This band gap reduction effect is known as optical bowing according to the referenced article.1Table 1 shows the Hall measurement data of the all solution chemical CIS thin films with highly (112) preferred orientation, and electrical resistivity, carrier concentration and mobility of the annealed CIS thin films exhibiting p-type conductivity is 9.055 × 10−1 Ω cm, 1.44 × 1019 cm−3 and 4.79 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 S−1. The result is basically consistent with the CIS thin films with nearly 112 phase stoichiometry reported in ref. 29.

In summary, we have described synthesis of sphalerite CuInSe2 lamellar nanoplates with phase-pure, single-crystalline, near-stoichiometry, monodispersed and high diameter–thickness ratio by a novel, green, ambient pressure solution chemical synthesis using ethylenediamine-assisted triethylene glycol solvent and inorganic precursors in the injection temperature range of 210–230 °C. Morphology of the CIS nanocrystals was strongly dependent on injection temperature. Highly (112) oriented polycrystalline chalcopyrite CIS thin films could be obtained by layer-by-layer dip-coating with sphalerite CIS nanoplate ethanol-based stable colloidal ink and annealing at 500 °C in Ar atmosphere for 20 min. The present solution approach provides an accessible way which applies solution-based processing to produce the oriented polycrystalline structure CIS based light-absorbing layer, similarly to some physical vapor depositions leading to high photovoltaic performance for thin film solar cells.
