    , Accepted 28th October 2015First published on 18th November 2015AbstractSince the triplet–triplet annihilated upconversion (TTA-UC) materials work efficiently only in degassing organic solvents, it is of significance to find a new medium without toxicity and volatility and that promotes TTA-UC. Here, we firstly reported the effect of an OH-containing medium on low power upconversion and found that in alcohol solvent containing β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), the phosphorescence lifetime (τp) of the sensitizer (PdTPP) and the fluorescence quantum yield (Φf) of the acceptor (DPA) were enhanced with the increase in the number of OH-groups of the medium. A large triplet–triplet quenching constant (kq, 1.91 × 109 M−1 s−1) and high upconversion efficiency (ΦUC, ∼36%) of PdTPP/DPA were obtained under the excitation of a diode laser (532 nm, 60 mW cm−2). Under our green-to-blue upconversion irradiation, in a demonstration experiment the photocurrent was recorded at 0.09 μA cm−2, resulting from photocatalytic water splitting by a Cd0.7Zn0.3S photoanode and a Pt counter-electrode in a photoelectrochemical cell. The importance of this study suggests that upconversion-powered photoelectrochemistry possesses potential application for hydrogen generation from water under excitation of sun energy.
Introduction
Photon upconversion (UC) can convert low-energy photons to high-energy photons based on a two-photon absorption (TPA)1–3 or triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA)4–7 mechanism. The triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) mechanism involves a bimolecular system containing a sensitizer and an acceptor. Firstly, the sensitizer harvests the excitation energy toward its triplet excited state by intersystem crossing (ISC), then the triplet energy of the sensitizer transfers to the acceptor (i.e., triplet–triplet energy transfer, TTT). Lastly, two excited triplet acceptors would annihilate (i.e., triplet–triplet annihilation, TTA) and one of them irradiates the high-energy light (upconversion) from the excited state to the ground state.5 Since the processes mentioned above, including ISC, TTT and TTA, are transition-allowed, the TTA-UC can be achieved at ultra-low excitation power that is less than the terrestrial solar radiation (ca. 100 mW cm−2),6,7 which shows widespread practical applications such as in solar cells,8–13 photocatalysis/photodegradation,14–16 photodynamic therapy of cancer17–19 and displays.20
Presently, the TTA-upconversion is investigated either in solution21–25 or in the solid state.26–33 The reported upconversion efficiencies (ΦUC) in solid matrices never exceed 6% under the excitation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 because the TTA-UC is diffusion controlled34 and the diffusion is intrinsically inhibited in the solid state.26 On the other hand, the chromophore diffusion in solution can be significantly promoted, which gives the solution-based upconversion very large efficiency (as high as 39%).21–25 However, the TTA-UC solvents usually employed are organic solvents such as benzene,7 DMF,21,22 toluene,23 dichloromethane,24 and acetonitrile.25 These deleterious organic solvents obviously produce critical environment problems. Moreover, since the TTA upconversion materials work efficiently only in the degassing solution,35,36 the volatile organic solvents apparently bring about some application limitations.
We herein reported a new OH-containing medium, which is comprised of an alcohol solvent and β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), acting as an effective solvent for TTA-UC performance. Dynamic data indicated that in this medium, the sensitizer (PdTPP) presented a long phosphorescence lifetime (28.31 μs) and the acceptor (DPA) lay in favorable fluorescence deactivation. The Stern–Volmer equation confirmed that an efficient triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTT) from the sensitizer to the acceptor was achieved in this medium. Selective excitation of metalloporphyrin (PdTPP) in the n-propanol/glycerol/β-CD media containing DPA resulted in green-to-blue upconversion with efficiency as high as ∼36%. Since the OH-containing medium shows many advantages, such as the absence of toxicity and volatility, and being economical and environmentally friendly, it is of great significance for TTA-upconversion applications. Photocatalysis under our green-to-blue upconversion (λ = 436 nm) irradiation is firstly investigated in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell. Using Cd0.7Zn0.3S as a photoanode and Pt-rod as the counter-electrode, the upconversion-powered photocurrent was obtained. Based on the energy level analysis, O2 evolution on the photoanode Cd0.7Zn0.3S and H2 evolution on the Pt-pole were achieved.
Experimental section
Chemicals and OH-containing solvents
The sensitizer Pd(II) tetraphenylporphyrin (PdTPP) was synthesized and characterized according to the literature,37,38 9,10-diphenylanthracence (DPA) and β-cyclodextrin (abbreviated as β-CD) were commercially available. β-CD was re-crystallized before measurements. OH-containing solvents, including n-butanol (abbreviated as BuOH), n-propanol (abbreviated as PrOH) and glycol (abbreviated as Gly) were of spectral purity and used without further purification.
The solutions containing PdTPP, DPA and PdTPP/DPA are prepared in different alcohol solvents with varying polar parameter (ET(30)) values (see Table 1); the ET(30) values of BuOH and PrOH were obtained from the literature,39 and the ET(30) of mixed solvents were estimated based on the respective content (weight coefficient). We noticed that PdTPP, DPA and PdTPP/DPA dissolved well in these alcohol solvents (shown in Fig. S7, ESI†).

Cd0.7Zn0.3S was synthesized according to the literature.40 A specific amount of zinc acetate (Zn(Ac)2·2H2O, 0.36 g) and cadmium sulfate (3CdSO4·8H2O, 0.92 g) was added to 40 mL of deionized water under magnetic stirring. Then, 20 mL of sodium sulfide aqueous solution (Na2S, 0.45 M) was added dropwise into the solution. The mixture solution was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 10 h. After centrifugation, the solid was isolated, washed with deionized water 3 times and dried at 70 °C. The resultant yellow samples were stored in darkness before measurements.
Absorption and photoluminescence
The absorption spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U-3500 spectrophotometer using quartz cuvettes of 1 cm path. Steady-state emission and time-resolved decay curves were recorded on an Edinburgh FLS 920 fluorophotometer equipped with a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) card. With the aid of nF900 software, the fluorescence lifetime (τf) was measured, which is detected under an nF lamp at room temperature; while the phosphorescence lifetime (τp) was measured under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature, and detected under a microsecond xenon flash lamp (Edinburgh Analytical Instruments, μF900). For all radiation decay (fluorescence and phosphorescence), monoexponential or diexponential fits give acceptable statistical parameters of χ2 < 1.1 (χ2 is the “reduced chi-square”). Fluorescence quantum yields (Φf) were measured using quinine sulfate (in 0.1 mM dm−3 aqueous NaOH, Φr = 0.53) as the standard according to the literature;41 similarly, phosphorescence quantum yields (Φp) were obtained. The radiative (kf = Φf/τf) and nonradiative (knr = kf(1 − Φf)/Φf) decay rate constants for DPA in OH-containing media are calculated.
TTA-upconversion
A diode solid state laser (532 nm) was used as the excitation source for TTA-upconversion. The laser power was measured using a photodiode detector. For TTA-upconversion experiments, the mixed solutions containing a sensitizer and an acceptor were degassed for about 10 min with N2. Then the solution was excited with the laser. The upconverted fluorescence was observed using a PR655 Spectra Scan colorimeter. (1) TTA-upconversion efficiency (ΦUC) can be calculated using eqn (1),26 where subscripts ‘‘s’’ and ‘‘r’’ represent the sample (either sensitizer or acceptor) and the reference (Rhodamine 6G in EtOH was used as standard, ΦF = 88%), respectively. Φr is the fluorescence quantum yield of reference, A is the absorbance, F is the integrated fluorescence intensity and η is the refractive index of solvents. The equation is multiplied by a factor of 2, accounting for the fact that two absorbed photons are required to produce one upconverted photon.
Upconversion powered photoelectrochemistry
The photoelectrochemical behaviors were measured using a CHI660D potentiostat/galvanostat electrochemical analyzer in a three-electrode system consisting of a working electrode, a platinum wire as a counter-electrode and Ag/AgCl (0.1 M) as a reference electrode.42 The working electrode was prepared by coating the ethanol suspension of Cd0.7Zn0.3S powders onto a clean indium tin oxide (ITO) glass and was dried under vacuum at 70 °C. The electrodes were immersed in a supporting electrolyte solution (1.0 M H2SO4). Prior to the measurement, the solution was deaerated by bubbling Ar for 1 h. During the measurement, the working electrode was irradiated by our upconverting irradiation from a quartz cuvette containing PdTPP/DPA in PrOH/Gly/β-CD (1/2/2.4, v/v/mM). Cd0.7Zn0.3S with 1 cm2 active area and 1 μm thickness was deposited on ITO glass that was placed close to the quartz cuvette. A diode pumped solid state laser (532 nm, 60 mW cm−2) was used as the excitation source for the upconversion.
Results and discussion
Absorption and photoluminescence properties
As presented in Fig. 1a, the absorption spectra of PdTPP in different alcohol solvents show strong absorption in the Soret-band (413 nm) and weak absorption in the Q-band (523 nm); and the photoluminescence spectra show dual fluorescence bands at >650 nm and dual phosphorescence bands at >650 nm, as identified by the time-resolved decay measurements. Detailed data for absorption and photoluminescence are presented in Table 1. With the increase in the number of OH-groups of solvent, the phosphorescence quantum yield (Φp) and the phosphorescence lifetime (τp2) of PdTPP increased from 0.86% and 14.39 μs in BuOH, 1.23% and 16.69 μs in PrOH, 2.74% and 18.13 μs in PrOH/Gly (2/1, v/v), 3.26% and 21.77 μs in PrOH/Gly (1/1, v/v), 4.86% and 26.03 μs in PrOH/Gly (1/2, v/v) to 5.34% and 28.31 μs in PrOH/Gly/β-CD (1/1/2.4, v/v/mM) (Fig. 1b, Table 1).

In the meantime, the quantum yield (Φf) of DPA presents an increase in different alcohol solvents with more OH-groups. As shown in Table 2, the Φf values of DPA increased from 89.32% in BuOH, 89.44% in PrOH, 91.39% in PrOH/Gly (2/1, v/v), 93.57% in PrOH/Gly (1/1, v/v), 94.05% in PrOH/Gly (1/2, v/v) to 94.48% in PrOH/Gly/β-CD (1/1/2.4, v/v/mM), with a concomitant 2-fold increase in the fluorescence lifetime (τf). The calculated kf/knr values of DPA are in the order of 8.38 in BuOH < 8.50 in PrOH < 10.60 in PrOH/Gly (2/1, v/v) < 14.61 in PrOH/Gly (1/1, v/v) < 15.77 in PrOH/Gly (1/2, v/v) < 17.21 in β-CD (1/1/2.4, v/v/mM).

All of these discussed above suggest that the alcohol solvent with more OH-groups is not only beneficial to the triplet population of the sensitizer (PdTPP), but also favorable to the fluorescence deactivation of the acceptor (DPA), which probably results from intermolecular H-bond formation in the solvent. In the presence of β-CD that can provide many more OH-groups, the triplet lifetime of PdTPP (28.31 μs) was enhanced ulteriorly. At the same time, DPA tends to enter the cavity of β-CD and its free rotation is restricted, which results in the additional increase of the Φf value (Fig. 2).

TTA-upconversion in OH-containing media
Using the diode laser (532 nm, 60 mW cm−2) as the excitation source, the green-to-blue upconversion was observed at 436 nm (Fig. 3a). Power-dependent upconversion intensity of DPA/PdTPP in PrOH exhibited a quadratic integral enhancement as a function of incident power density of 10.3–60.0 mW cm−2 (Fig. 3b and inset), implying that TTA-UC is a nonlinear optical process. Based on eqn (1), the ΦUC values of DPA/PdTPP in different solvents are calculated to be in the order of 35.89% in PrOH/Gly/β-CD (1/2/2.4, v/v/mM) > 29.1% in PrOH/Gly (1/2, v/v) > 25.4% in PrOH/Gly (1/1, v/v) > 22.9% in PrOH/Gly (2/1, v/v) > 20.7% in PrOH > 18.4% in BuOH (Table 3), showing a dramatic increase as the number of OH-groups of the medium increases.

 Fig. 3  (a) Upconversion spectra of DPA/PdTPP (2.4 mM/8 μM) in different OH-containing solvents excited by a diode laser (532 nm, 60 mW cm−2) and (b) power-dependent upconversion intensity of DPA/PdTPP (2.4 mM/8 μM) in PrOH (inset: logarithmic plots of upconversion integral versus power density). 
To gain insight on whether the solvent effect on the TTA-upconversion is caused by polarity or not, we investigated polarity-dependent TTA-upconversion of DPA/PdTPP under identical measurement conditions. Interestingly, the results indicated that the protonic and aprotic solvent effects exhibit two different trends (Fig. 4). That is, ΦUC in the protonic solvent is increased with an increase of the solvent polarity parameter ET(30). For example, the ΦUC value increased from 18.4% in BuOH (ET(30), 49.7), 20.7% in PrOH (ET(30), 50.7), 22.9% in PrOH/Gly (2/1, v/v) (ET(30), 52.6); 25.4% in PrOH/Gly (1/1, v/v) (ET(30), 53.5) to 29.1% in PrOH/Gly (1/2, v/v) (ET(30), 54.6). In contrast, the ΦUC value in an aprotic solvent decreased with increasing solvent polarity, that is, at 8.1% in acetonitrile (ET(30), 45.6), 12.9% in DMF (ET(30), 43.2), 25.6% in ethyl acetate (ET(30), 38.9), 30.7% in toluene (ET(30), 33.9) and 35.4% in cyclohexane (ET(30), 30.9) (Fig. 4, inset). (Detailed absorption and photoluminescence spectra of PdTPP and DPA as well as the upconversion spectra of DPA/PdTPP in aprotic solvents are presented in Fig. S1–S5 and Table S1, ESI†). So, the comparative investigation of protonic and aprotic solvent effects upon the TTA-upconversion implied that the influence of the OH-solvent on the TTA-upconversion is not exerted by polarity but by intermolecular H-bonding.

Excitation conditions: 532 nm laser at 60 mW cm−2. (A: BuOH; B: PrOH; C: PrOH/Gly (2/1, v/v); D: PrOH/Gly (1/1, v/v); and E: PrOH/Gly (1/2, v/v)). 
In order to further examine the OH group effect on the upconversion efficiency (ΦUC), we measured the TTA-upconversion behaviors of DPA/PdTPP in the presence of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) that can provide many more OH-groups. As anticipated, with the addition of β-CD to alcohol solvent, the upconversion intensities of DPA/PdTPP were indeed enhanced (Fig. 5a–c). We noticed that the optimized additional concentration of β-CD is equal to the concentration of DPA (Fig. 5d), suggesting that one molecule of DPA enters the cavity of β-CD to form the supra-molecular DPA:β-CD (1:1, mM/mM), where the free rotation of DPA is restricted within the hollow ring of β-CD′. As a result, the ΦUC value shows an increase from 29.1% in PrOH/Gly (1/2, v/v) to 35.89% in PrOH/Gly/β-CD (1/2/2.4, v/v/mM), reaching about a 1.24-fold increase in comparison with the solvent (PrOH/Gly) without β-CD. Similar conditions are also observed in other alcohol solvents (see Fig. 5d): that is, 18.4% in BuOH vs. 23.65% in BuOH/β-CD (1/2.4, v/mM) and 20.7% in PrOH vs. 25.75% in PrOH/β-CD (1/2.4, v/mM).

Theoretically, TTA-UC efficiency (ΦUC) is affected by a series of processes including the triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTT) from the sensitizer to the acceptor, the fluorescence quantum yield (Φf) and the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) of the acceptor, as presented by eqn (2). ΦUC = ΦTTT × ΦTTA × Φf(2) (3)
Here, TTT efficiency (ΦTTT) can be estimated according to the Stern–Volmer equation, eqn (3), where P0 and P are the phosphorescence intensities of PdTPP without and with DPA. KSV is the Stern–Volmer constant; kq is the phosphorescence quenching constant which can stand for the ΦTTT value; τ0 is the phosphorescence lifetime of PdTPP and [Q] is the concentration of DPA. Thus, the relationship between P0/P and [Q] is plotted in Fig. 6, where the linear slope is equal to KSV (Table 3), showing an order of 4.56 in PrOH/Gly/β-CD (1/2/2.4, v/v/mM) > 3.97 PrOH/Gly (1/2, v/v) > 3.31 in PrOH/Gly (1/1, v/v) > 2.60 in PrOH/Gly (2/1, v/v) > 2.11 in PrOH > 1.64 in BuOH. If the phosphorescence lifetime of the sensitizer (τp = τp1·x% + τp2·(1 − x%)) is taken into account (see Table 1), the quenching constants (kq, 109 M−1 s−1) are in the order of 1.91 in PrOH/Gly/β-CD (1/2/2.4, v/v/mM) > 1.80 in PrOH/Gly (1/2, v/v) > 1.71 in PrOH/Gly (1/1, v/v) > 1.48 in PrOH/Gly (2/1, v/v) > 1.37 in PrOH > 1.22 in BuOH (Table 3), that is, the TTT efficiency (ΦTTT) shows a gradual increase as the number of OH-groups of the medium increases. On the other hand, these kq values show almost one order of magnitude lower than the diffusion limit in aprotic organic solvents such as benzene (kd = 1.1 × 1010 M−1 s−1) and DMF (kd = 8.3 × 109 M−1 s−1),21,43 strongly suggesting that the triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTT) in alcohol solvents is different from that in aprotic organic solvents.

Based on the above analysis, the proposed TTA-UC mechanism in the OH-containing medium is that the intermolecular H-bond of the medium contributes to the triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTT) and the fluorescence quantum yield (Φf). In the presence of β-CD, the hydrogen bond network of the cyclodextrin ring could slightly attract the metal ion of metallated porphyrin to form weak metal–oxygen interactions,44 which would likely be beneficial to enhance the TTT efficiency (kq, 1.91 × 109 M−1 s−1). Meanwhile, the Φf value of DPA shows further enhancement (94.48%) and the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) of DPA would also be increased since the free rotation of DPA is restricted and all other excited relaxation is decreased within β-CD. In this way (Fig. 7), high upconversion efficiency (ΦUC, ∼36%) was lastly obtained.

Upconversion-powered photoelectrochemistry
In recent years, many substantial efforts have been made towards the development of high efficiency energy conversion systems for turning solar light into chemicals, considering the sustainable and inexhaustible character of sunlight.45–47 Here, a potentially useful strategy toward TTA-upconversion is firstly applied for upconversion-powered photocatalysis in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell, which is the most advanced method to produce hydrogen by water splitting.48 Under the excitation of a diode laser (532 nm, 60 mW cm−2), the blue upconverted photons can radiate from the quartz cuvette containing the bimolecular PdTPP/DPA in PrOH/Gly/β-CD (1/2/2.4, v/v/mM) media. Using a computer controlled electrochemistry station, the photoelectronic current (Ii) can be recorded. In order to eliminate the photocurrent directly resulting from the upconverted composition, the contrastive experiment was conducted under identical conditions except for using a quartz cuvette containing only blank solvent. The results indicated that the Cd0.7Zn0.3S photoanode produced photocurrent density (Ii) at ∼0.09 μA cm−2 (Fig. 8a).
 Fig. 8  (a) The recorded photocurrent curve in the PEC cell and (b) the proposed mechanism for photocatalytic H2-production under green-to-blue upconversion irradiation. 
The optical behavior of the Zn0.3Cd0.7S film was investigated by UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (Fig. S4, ESI†). The absorption band edge of the Zn0.3Cd0.7S film at around 527 nm corresponds to its band gap energy (2.35 eV) with the valence band (VB) at 2.010 eV and the conduction band (CB) at −0.360 eV.49 A possible mechanism of photocatalysis is proposed in Fig. 8b, which shows the redox potentials of Zn0.3Cd0.7S in relation to the normal hydrogen electrode potential (NHE). The appropriate energy levels of the conduction and valence band edges ensure that Zn0.3Cd0.7S acts as a photoanode. Under the green-to-blue upconversion irradiation, the photogenerated electrons (e) are excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of Zn0.3Cd0.7S. The electrons then transfer to the Pt counter-electrode, where they can react with H+ to form H2. The holes remaining on the surface of Zn0.3Cd0.7S react with water to produce O2.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated for the first time that the alcohol solvent containing β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is a feasible medium for triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC). In this medium, the sensitizer (PdTPP) is found to have a longer phosphorescence lifetime (28.31 μs) and promotes the triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTT), as confirmed by the Stern–Volmer equation. In the presence of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), the free rotation of DPA is restricted with the result that both the fluorescence deactivation and the triplet–triplet annihilation of the acceptor (DPA) are enhanced. Thus, a significant increase in the upconversion efficiency (ΦUC) up to ∼36% was obtained under excitation of low power density at 60 mW cm−2 (λex = 532 nm).
A demonstration experiment of photocatalytic water splitting using semiconducting catalysts has been carried out in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell, wherein the oxidation takes place at a Zn0.3Cd0.7S semiconductor photoanode and hydrogen is produced at a platinum rod counter-electrode. Thus, the photocurrent resulting from the hydrogen generation is recorded at ca. 0.09 μA cm−2. The importance in this study suggests that upconversion-powered photoelectrochemistry possesses potential application for hydrogen generation from water under excitation of sun energy.
