1. Introduction
Variable infrared (IR) optical property technology has attracted increasing interest due to the promising applications in commercial thermal control and environmentally adaptable military camouflage.1–4 For promising thermal management, the two basic strategies are to change the local temperature T of the target, and tune the local surface emissivity of the target according to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, P = εσT,4 where ε is the surface emissivity, σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature of the surface. Due to the huge energy consumption and inconvenience of temperature control, several well-designed strategies have been proposed, which focus on manipulating the surface emissivity across both the mid-wave IR (3–5 μm) and long-wave IR (8–14 μm) without changing the temperature of the surface. For instance, phase change materials such as VO2,5–7 Ge3Sb2Te6 (GST)8,9 and manganese oxides10 have been demonstrated to be infrared-modulating materials in emissivity engineering applications because they can realize a dramatic change in the infrared optical properties by the thermally induced phase transitions; however, they feature high operating temperatures, hysteresis during cycling, and structural characteristics that are difficult to control. In addition, carbon materials such as CNTs and graphene11–13 can display significant tunable optical absorptions in the IR region stimulated by electric fields, electrical double layers and intercalation species, but there are still challenges due to the lack of low-cost manufacturing techniques and visible compatibility. Moreover, cephalopod-inspired systems modulate the infrared light intensity by altering their microstructured surfaces of active areas but they are subjected to inadequate total IR emittance changes and high triggering voltage.14,15 Furthermore, reversible metal electrodeposition (RME) modifies the infrared signatures by manipulating the deposition and dissolution of a metal on a conductive substrate but requires complexity and high cost of fabrication, restricting implementation in a wide range of applications.16,17 Consequently, to enable a broad range of practical applications (such as camouflage, thermal management), ideal IR management systems should be equipped with a simple actuation mechanism, low working temperature, tunable spectral range, fast response, stability to repeated cycling, etc.
Electrochromic (EC) technology provides an efficient approach to achieve IR modulation under the application of a low driving voltage.18,19 EC materials and their assembled EC devices (ECDs) demonstrate optical modulation behaviors (including transmittance, absorbance and reflectance) in a broad wavelength range from the visible light region to the IR region.20,21 With the development of characterization technology, research on the EC materials modulating IR emissivity has made substantial progress in recent years. The EC materials with IR modulation behaviors are mainly transition metal oxides and conducting polymers, which been have further developed into integrated devices. Electrochromic devices capable of modulating IR emissivity are usually called infrared electrochromic devices (IR-ECDs), whose configurations are similar to conventional ECDs with multilayer structures but have some special components toward IR modulation. The IR-ECDs can realize reversible switching between the different IR optical states (transmittance, reflectance or emittance), which are promising in both civilian and military applications, such as building smart windows, thermal control, and military camouflage.22–25 Compared with other IR modulation technologies, the EC technology demonstrates some unique advantages, such as wide IR modulation ranges, low energy consumption and operating voltage, reversible cycling stability and low-cost manufacturing. Despite many insightful reviews concerning EC materials and devices, almost all of them are focused on optical modulation in the visible light region, to the best of our knowledge. Considering the advantages of ECDs in IR modulation, there is the need for comprehensive summaries and discussions on the construction of IR-ECDs to promote advanced EC technology in the applications concerning variable IR emissivity. In this review, recent progress and advances in some electrochromic devices with infrared performance modulation are summarized and discussed in detail. Firstly, we present the fundamentals of the IR-ECDs including the working principle, special device configuration and main performance parameters. The latest research progress on the IR-ECDs is then reviewed in detail based on the classification of inorganic and organic infrared EC materials. Finally, some challenges and prospects are proposed for the future development of high-performance IR-ECDs. We anticipate that this review will provide a route for the construction of advanced IR-ECDs towards real-world applications in smart windows, sensors, thermal control and military camouflage (Fig. 1).
2. Fundamentals of infrared electrochromic devices
2.1 Working principle
Infrared electrochromic materials constitute the core of IR-ECDs, which manipulate the infrared EC properties and thermal management. Conventional electrochromic materials are mainly divided into two categories: organic and inorganic electrochromic materials. Among the inorganic materials, transition metal oxides (TMOs) such as WO3,26–28 TiO2,29,30 V2O5,31,32 MoO3,33,34 NiO,35–37 MnO2,38,39 IrO2,40 Co3O4,41,42 Nb2O543 and Ta2O544 have long been studied for possessing electrochromic performance. It is widely accepted that the injection/extraction of electrons results in the electrochromic phenomena of TMOs.45–47 However, only a few TMOs materials such as WO3, NiO and Li4Ti5O12 can provide the capability of regulating the IR electrochromic characteristics via a reduction or cation intercalation. As the best-known electrochromic material, the electrochromic reaction eqn (1) of WO3 can be described as follows: WO3 (bleached) + xM+ + xe− ↔ MxWO3 (colored)(1)where the M+ cation can be either H+ or an alkali metal ion such as Li+, Na+, or K+. The WO3 layer reversibly changes from optically transparent to deep blue upon positive-ion insertion and extraction, accompanied by exhibiting significant IR emissivity modulation. The varying concentration of free electrons induced by intervalence electron transfer from W5+ to W6+ leads to the different bandgaps and triggers the different absorptions of the IR light.48,49 The similar EC mechanism and reversible infrared EC properties also occur in other TMO (i.e., NiO, L4Ti5O12) materials. A deeper understanding of the principles of the modulation of infrared light by the TMOs will be beneficial for effectively improving the ability to regulate emissivity and establish relationships between the material design and performance optimization.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of representative infrared electrochromic applications with high IR performances. 
For organic electrochromic materials, it mainly includes organic small molecules50 (such as viologen51), transition metal–ligand complexes (such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)52–54) and conjugated polymers (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT),55–57 polypyrrole (PPy),58 polyaniline (PANI)59,60 and polyindole61). In terms of the electrochromic performance of conjugated polymers, they present high coloration efficiency, large color contrasts, rapid response times, and low power consumption during the operation. Unlike the EC mechanism of electrochromic TMOs, conjugated polymers undergo electron transfer during the electrochemical reduction in the material, called the doping/dedoping process.62–64 This process results in the altering of the structures of their π-conjugated systems, thus leading to changes in both energy gap and optical modulation.65,66 Conducting polymers (CPs), as part of conjugated polymers, have been intensively investigated as dynamic infrared regulatory materials that can change their infrared emissivity via the formation and elimination of charge carriers such as polarons and bipolarons at their conjugated chain.67 Another accepted theory for explaining the IR regulation mechanism of CPs is the energy level theory. These CPs display semiconducting behavior in neutral states with an energy gap (Eg) between the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and the Lowest Occupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO), which is similar to the bandgap in inorganic semiconductors. The electrochemical doping-induced charges change the electronic structure, thus leading to a reduction in the HOMO–LUMO energy gap and triggering the transition of the polymer from a neutral state to single-charged (polaron) and double-charged (bi-polaron) states.68–70 During the process, it always involves a change of conductivity by switching between the doped and undoped states. The correlation between infrared reflectivity and conductivity can be expressed by using the Hagen–Rubens approximation through eqn (2):71 (2)where Rω is the reflectivity at angular frequency ω and σ is the conductivity. Eqn (2) suggests that the better the conductivity, the higher the reflectivity.
2.2 Device structure
The structure of the EC device depends on the practical electrochromic applications in different wavelength regions. For example, some ECDs configurations for applications such as smart windows, goggles, e-papers and rearview mirrors, etc., have been designed to require the ability of tunable visible and near-infrared (NIR) light modulation.72–76 Many requirements for EC applications in the infrared region are relatively stringent, which demands efficient manipulation of the IR light and heat through reflection, transmission, and emission. Therefore, the design and preparation of IR-ECDs need to be considered for their applications in optical and thermal regulation. The generic infrared electrochromic device usually demonstrates the multilayer configuration that involves the infrared electrochromic layer, high reflectance conductor layer, electrolyte and ion storage layers (Fig. 2a). Such a device structure is similar to the conventional ECDs (Fig. 2b), but some critical components in the device need to be well designed to ensure the IR characteristics. In this section, the specific materials and device designs for constructing high-performance IR-ECDs are described.
 Fig. 2  Comparisons of the structures of the IR electrochromic (a) and conventional devices (b). 

2.2.1 Electrochromic layer. 
As the core component, the infrared EC layer determines the infrared emissivity modulation performance of the IR-ECDs. The EC layer is composed of materials that can modulate the IR emissivity. The representative EC materials involve some transition metal oxides including WO3, NiO and Li4Ti5O12, and some conducting polymers, such as PEDOT, PANI and their derivatives. Unlike conventional ECDs whose electrochromic layer is sandwiched between the conductor layer and electrolyte layer (Fig. 2b), the EC layer of IR-ECDs is required to be exposed on the top of the whole device as shown in Fig. 2a. In such device design, only the outward-facing EC electrode is mainly in charge of the surface IR optical regulation.


2.2.2 Conducting layer. 
The conducting layer must feature a high conductivity to provide certain voltages for driving the electrochromic phenomenon. Considering that the device needs to control the IR light and heat through reflection, transmission and emission, the conducting layer can be generalized into two types: the IR transmissive-type and IR reflective-type. Similar to the conventional ECDs with the conducting layers being the outermost layers, IR transmissive-type conducting layers should have high transparency in the IR region. The widely used materials as the conducting layer are the wide-spaced metal grids (such as Au, Ag and Al).77–80 The main advantages of these metal grids lie in their excellent mechanical stability, high conductivity, as well as low-cost fabrication, which are superior to indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass. Importantly, the metal grids have the interspaces for IR to pass through.81,82 Some materials such as barium fluoride (BaF2), zinc selenide (ZnSe), single-crystal germanium (Ge) and silicon (Si) are promising candidates as IR-transmissive-type conducting layers. They can also act as the protective coating for eliminating the adverse effects of environmental factors on devices.83–85
Regarding IR reflective-type materials, unlike conventional ECDs with two outermost conducting layers, the conducting layer lies between the EC layer and electrolyte layer. In this case, metals (such as Au and Al) with high IR reflectivity are usually used in the conducting layer. However, the ionic diffusion path is constrained by the metal layer. In other words, the electrolyte can hardly pass through the metal layer to have an electrochemical reaction with the EC layer. Besides, the flexibility is limited to meet the requirements of IR-ECDs. To overcome the above barriers, the approach involves utilizing microporous substrates (such as microporous polyethersulfone (PES), porous nylon 66, etc.), onto which a metallic layer (typically Au) is deposited. The porous structure allows the conductive surfaces to establish an electrical connection with the electrolyte. Therefore, the unique materials and structure design of conducting layer are necessary for IR-ECDs.


2.2.3 Ion conductor layer. 
The ion conductor layer is also called the electrolyte layer, which provides ions for electrochemical reactions at the interface between the EC layer and the ion conductor layer under the applied voltage. Formulating the ideal electrolyte layer in IR-ECDs is about finding the right combination of both physical and chemical properties. Generally, the electrolytes used in IR-ECDs are solid-state electrolytes, gel electrolytes and ionic liquids. For example, all-solid-state IR-ECDs based on TMOs are commonly integrated with inorganic solid-state electrolytes such as LiTaO3,86 ZrO287 or Ta2O5,88,89 which exhibit considerable advantages such as good durability, and no bubble formation and electrolyte leakage problems during manufacturing. However, low ionic conductivity and poor mechanical stability remain a challenge. Ionic liquids (IL) are molten salts that are liquid at room temperature and are comprised of dissociated ions with no intervening solvent.90 The high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window, as well as excellent physical and chemical stability of ILs91–93 are highly desired for IR-ECDs and their practical applications in extreme space vacuum and temperature conditions. Although ILs show promising characteristics for use as electrolytes in EC applications, their electrolyte leakage, high cost and other safety issues limit their use as the sole electrolyte. The gel polymer electrolytes are commonly considered to be candidate electrolytes due to the integrated advantages of the cohesive properties of solids and the diffusive transport properties of liquids. As gel polymer electrolytes, they are composed of liquid electrolytes dissolved in some polymer material that is capable of forming a stable gel with the polymer host structure.94,95 There are some representative polymer matrix materials such as poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and poly(vinylidenefluoride-hexafluoro propylene) (PVDF-HFP), which have received much more attention in electrochromic applications. These gel polymer electrolytes are characterized by a higher ionic conductivity and flexibility but the poorer mechanical property is the main obstacle that restricts the further development of gel polymer electrolytes.


2.2.4 Ion storage layer. 
In the device design, the ion storage layer (counter electrode) with or without electrochromism functions as the ion storage and balances the charge generated at the EC layer.96 NiO,97,98 IrO2,99 Prussian Blue (PB)100 and MnO2101 are reported in a considerable number of studies as the ion storage layer in which NiO and IrO2 are typically used in IR-ECDs based on TMOs, and are widely investigated. In addition, the design principle of IR-ECDs based on CPs is usually to exploit the dual-polymer systems in which the EC and ion storage layer are the same or complementary conducting polymers. Notably, ion storage layer materials play an indispensable role in different types of IR-ECDs. For example, in IR-ECDs with ideal variable transmittance, ECDs require the ion-storage layer, as well the electrolyte to maintain high IR transmittance and make as little impact on the infrared tunability as possible. In this respect, Shim et al.102 investigated the effects of NiO with various microstructures on the electrochromic properties of the ECDs. The ECDs showed high transmittance contrast (Tcolored/Tbleached) of 0.66 and 0.72 in the mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) and long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) ranges, respectively, which ensured high transmittance in the window mode as an infrared sensor system.

2.3 Performance parameters
The IR modulation behavior of the IR-ECDs is usually evaluated by the main performance parameters of the IR modulation amplitude, thermal management, cycling performance, response time and coloration efficiency, etc. In this section, the key parameters for evaluating the performance of an IR-ECDs are listed systematically.

2.3.1 IR modulation amplitude. 
The most important performance parameter of IR-ECDs is the IR modulation amplitude because it directly determines the thermal control efficiency of its applications. It is defined as the maximum optical change (IR emissivity, reflectivity or transmittance) at a specific wavelength range between the different redox states of the active EC materials. For ideal IR-ECDs in their practical applications, better values of optical modulation are expected. Notably, the relationship between the emissivity (ε), transmittance (T), absorptivity (A) and reflectivity (R) are subjected to eqn (3):103 T(λ) + A(λ) + R(λ) = 1(3)
In addition, if the material or the device is opaque (non-transmitting) in a particular spectral region, the emissivity can be calculated from eqn (4): ε = 1 − R(4)
According to Kirchhoff's radiation law, the absorptivity of objects also equals the emissivity in thermal equilibrium conditions though eqn (5):104 A = ε(5)
The blackbody spectrum (B(λ)) is usually derived from Planck's blackbody radiation law. The emissivity can be calculated from the experimentally measured reflectance spectrum (R(λ)) by using B(λ) for a particular wavelength and integrating over the measured wavelength range according to the following eqn (6) and (7):105 (6) (7)where c1 is the first radiation constant (3.7418 × 108 W μm4 m−2), c2 is the second radiation constant (1.4388 × 104 μm K), λ is a given wavelength and T is the temperature. The λ1 and λ2 in eqn (7) represent the wavelength range.


2.3.2 Cycling performance and durability. 
The cycling performance is an important index for evaluating the stability of IR-ECDs, which is characterized as the evolution of charge density or the optical change for the number of switching cycles without significant degradation. Cycle stability is mainly determined by the electrochemical stability of the EC materials, electrolyte, ion storage layer, as well as external perturbations. Considering the special applications of IR-ECDs, such as military camouflage and in outer space, the ideal IR-ECDs in these fields are required to possess higher stability in contrast to civilian equipment. However, general organic materials such as PANI and PEDOT are restricted by their intrinsic structural fragility and are unsatisfactory for practical use. Many efforts have been made to improve EC characteristics, such as the formation of EC nanocomposites, optimized design of devices and suitable electrolytes.106–108 Durability is also an essential parameter for characterizing the operation state of the device in harsh environment conditions (such as temperature adaptability, acid and alkali, UV rays, etc.). In other words, the devices must have excellent weathering and electrochemical stability to avoid early failure during use.


2.3.3 Response time. 
The response time is defined as the time required for the IR-ECDs to switch between different electrochromic states. In this regard, it is generally expressed in two forms to evaluate the switching speed. One is measuring the time required for the optical changes (usually the emittance change) from 0 to 90% at a special wavelength. Another approach is to record the electric changes (i.e. current evolution) for a specified percentage by applying a potential or current using the chronoamperometric/chronopotentiometric measurements. Response time mainly depends on the electric field intensity, electronic conductivity of electrodes, microstructure of EC materials, ionic conductivity of electrolytes and ion diffusion process inside the device. In general, organic electrochromic materials commonly have higher switching speeds as compared to the traditional inorganic EC materials due to their high electrical conductivity and ionic transporting efficiency.109 As ideal IR-ECDs, a fast switching time is extremely attractive, but the expected performance is also determined by the field of applications. For example, a fast response speed is desired for devices applied in military equipment, but a relatively long switching time in electrochromic windows and eyewear is also accepted.


2.3.4 Coloration efficiency. 
Colouration efficiency (CE) is a basic metric of IR electrochromic material or IR-ECDs, which is defined as the optical density change (ΔOD) caused by a unit charge density (Q). It can be obtained from the following eqn (8): (8)where ΔOD is the change in the optical density, measured in the form of reflectance or emittance at a specific wavelength. Q is the charge transferred per unit area. Based on the formula, a high CE is required for a large optical modulation with a small charge consumption. Compared with inorganic materials, organic IR materials have higher coloration efficiencies because of their higher molar absorption.


2.3.5 Memory effect. 
Memory effect, also called bistability, is an intrinsic parameter of IR-ECDs, which refers to the ability to retain the optical properties of devices at the open-circuit state or minimal power requirements. Notably, the realization of excellent memory effect in devices is a promising approach for efficiently reducing power consumption and is of great importance for their practical applications, such as smart windows, thermal control and information displays. Many factors dramatically influence the bistability, including ambient atmospheric conditions, interfacial charge transport, the nature of the electrolyte and the active material in the ion storage layer.110–112 The good memory effect will further accelerate the development of infrared EC technology in various applications, especially the contribution to saving energy and thermal control on spacecraft.

3. Inorganic infrared electrochromic devices
Inorganic EC materials, especially the TMOs, have demonstrated dynamic optical tunability over the visible and infrared region, and have attracted significant research interest for infrared-related applications in recent years. As a critical role in inorganic infrared electrochromic devices composed of TMOs, these materials rely on the intercalation and de-intercalation of ions and electrons inducing IR optical modulation, and have exhibited great potential in the adaptive dynamic regulation of thermal radiation. In this section, we review the recent progress in IR-ECDs based on TMOs in terms of suitable IR-EC materials, device structural designs, performance optimization, thermal control properties, as well as potential applications. To sum up, the properties and characteristics of the IR-ECDs based on TMOs are summarized in Table 1.

3.1 WO3-based infrared electrochromic devices
As a most promising infrared EC material, tungsten oxide (WO3) is extensively studied for its dramatic changes in optical properties in the visible to the infrared region under external voltage stimuli. The dynamic and effective regulation of the infrared light, the various states of WO3, including the thin films, powders and incorporation in rigid or flexible devices, which exhibit tunable IR modulating performance, are the focus of these studies. In early reports, Rougier et al.113 synthesized WO3 thin films deposited on an FTO and Au substrate through a radio frequency sputtering (RFS) method. With the optimization of the deposition conditions, RFS-WO3 thin films showed a reflectance contrast of 73% in 3–5 μm and less than 30% in 8–12 μm. Sauvet et al.114 fabricated WO3 thin films deposited on a Au blank substrate that displayed efficient control of reflectance over the full infrared spectrum, especially the MW (3–5 μm) and LW (8–12 μm) bands. Under voltage bias, high infrared reflectance contrasts of 73% and 50% were observed in the MW and LW regions shown in Fig. 3a. Such reflectance contrast could change the amount of thermal radiation on the surface of WO3 films. Note that the measured apparent temperature of the inserted state of WO3 film was higher than that of the deinserted state, and the apparent temperature difference between the two states was about 35 °C (Fig. 3b), which enabled the potential thermal camouflage and thermal management applications. Moreover, they also demonstrated that the WO3 single layer could be suitable for incorporation into rigid and flexible ECDs for infrared modulation. Recently, Zhao et al.115 synthesized multi-color WO3 film with a Fabry–Perot (F–P) cavity structure on a tungsten layer via the magnetron sputtering method (Fig. 3c and d). By modulating nanocavity resonances, the WO3 film presents various structural colors in the visible region (Fig. 3e). The corresponding reflectance spectra exhibited a large reflectance modulation of 83%, and a large redshift from 462 nm to 710 nm was also obtained (Fig. 3f). In addition, the IR reflectance can be tuned by the layer thickness of the WO3. After parameter optimization, the infrared reflectance of green WO3 films can be modulated significantly at the different applied potentials. The maximum reflectance modulation (ΔR) was about 0.46 at 3–5 μm and 0.1539 at 8–12 μm (Fig. 3g). They further demonstrated potential thermal management capability. All results confirmed the promising IR optical properties of WO3 thin films.

The aforementioned electrochromic properties of WO3 mainly concentrates on the WO3 single layer. While considering the real applications, the WO3 material is commonly assembled into a multi-layered structured device with IR modulating characteristics. Hale et al.116 designed emissivity modulating ECDs by utilizing WO3 film as an IR material, which realized an emissivity variation of about 0.538 over the 2 to 13.8 μm spectral range. Although a conductive grid was introduced to serve as the top electrode of the device, the WO3 film responds to a majority of the emittance modulation. Larsson et al.87 designed two types of all-thin-film electrochromic devices with a similar glass/ITO/NiVxOyHz/ZrO2/WO3/Al-grid (Fig. 4a) structure and made a comparison of the infrared emittance modulation between the two devices.

The double WO3 layer device presented a higher emittance modulation (Δε) of 0.26 in the wavelength range of 2 μm to 50 μm, superior to that of the single WO3 layer device, which is attributed to the existence of an extra layer of WO3 suppressing the reflectance of the Al grid. Sauvet et al.117 fabricated a WO3-based device, where WO3 was the main active electrochromic layer, Ta2O5 was the electrolyte and NiO was the counter electrode, respectively (Fig. 4b). As a transparent conductor in the IR region, Au grids were deposited on the WO3 active layer by a photolithography method. Note that BaF2 material was selected as a protective layer for the device due to the high IR transparency in the region, and it could also improve the optical and thermal performance. As a result, the IR absorptance difference of the device between the colored and bleached states reached 0.27 in the mid-wavelength band (3–5 μm) and 0.18 in the long wavelength band (8–12 μm) (Fig. 4c).
According to previous studies, the crystallinity of WO3 plays a very important role in determining the electrochemical and optical properties.118–120 Both crystalline and amorphous WO3 possess EC performance upon ionic insertion but show different behaviors in the coloration and bleaching process. Amorphous WO3 (a-WO3) features a fast response time and high coloring efficiency due to the disordered arrangement of the octahedron in the structure, which provides open polygonal voids for ion transport.121–124 However, the degradation of its optical modulation is typically observed due to the loose structure and low chemical stability.125,126 Crystalline WO3 (c-WO3) shows high stability due to the long-range order of the atoms in the crystal, denser structure, stronger inter-atomic bond bonding, as well as lower dissolution rate in the electrolyte.127 The c-WO3 also has lower coloring efficiency and poor switching speed, which hinder its practical applications.128–132 The different optical properties between a-WO3 and c-WO3 is due to the electron localization or delocalization. In a-WO3, the absorptance modulation mainly occurs in the visible and near-infrared regions of the spectrum when the ions are inserted and the electrons become localized. However, in c-WO3, the injected electrons were to a significant extent delocalized and behaved like free electrons; the free-electron-like behavior resulted in optical modulation in the infrared region, which can be described by a modified Drude model. It should be noted that the different crystallinities of WO3 materials have their own selective optical tunabilities in the visible to IR region. Recent studies concentrated on c-WO3 and a-WO3 demonstrated their ability to tune the emittance/reflectance in both the visible and IR spectra. For example, Kislov et al.133 developed a-WO3 layers on polyimide (PI) and Si substrates, which realized high emittance modulation of 0.31 and 0.24 in the 2–20 μm, respectively. Such emittance modulation provides enhanced thermal control in spacecraft. Sheng Ly et al.134 designed a visible-to-mid-infrared broadband modulation of a-WO3 based ECDs with a five-layered structure composed of two metal-grid-based conductive layers sandwiching two layers of c-WO3 and a-WO3 (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, the emissivity of the as-fabricated device in the bleached state is overall higher than the colored one, exhibiting an emittance modulation of 0.2 in the whole IR spectral range (Fig. 5b). Except for the dynamic tunable IR emissivity, they further discussed the thermal camouflage performance by comparing with the apparent temperature of the device at different states. For c-WO3, it has also been proven for use in constructing IR-ECDs with dynamic emittance modulation characteristics. Huang et al.131 fabricated c-WO3 film on ITO glass, which realized a high emissivity modulation of 0.328 in the range of 1.5–20 μm. Franke et al.83 synthesized c-WO3 films by using a radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering technique and assembled it in the c-WO3/Ta2O5/a-WO3-based device. Note that the assembled device showed an emittance regulation of 0.16 in 2–40 μm between its bleached and colored states. To further improve the emittance modulation, Franke et al.135 developed an all-solid-state electrochromic reflectance device that includes a highly IR reflecting Al mirror and a 90% IR-transmissive Al grid top electrode (Fig. 5c). After optimizing the thickness of each layer, the device achieved an emittance variation of 0.2 in the spectral region from 2 to 40 μm (Fig. 5d). Zhang et al.86 fabricated five-layered all-solid-state ECDs with the structure of glass/ITO/NiOx/LiTaO3/WO3/ITO, where c-WO3 film acts as the top electrochromic layer to modulate IR emittance (Fig. 5e). The c-WO3-based device showed an emittance modulation of 0.15 in the spectral range of 8–14 μm (Fig. 5f).

Apart from the anhydrous tungsten oxide, the monohydrated tungsten oxide (WO3·H2O) has demonstrated improved IR optical properties due to the higher ion diffusion coefficient in the WO3·H2O material as compared to WO3.136 Bessie're et al.137 fabricated a series of flexible all-plastic IR electrochromic devices using WO3·H2O powder synthesized by the Freedman method on a plastic matrix. The WO3·H2O has an orthorhombic structure that belongs to the pnmb space group (Fig. 6a), and is formed from sheets of distorted octahedral units of tungsten atoms coordinated by five oxygen atoms and a water molecule, which is very favorable for ion insertion. Fig. 6b illustrates that the WO3·H2O powder showed about 40–90 mm platelet-shaped particles grain-oriented toward the surface. The smaller grains are favorable for lithium intercalation. The assembled electrochromic plastic device was composed of LiCoO2/Li electrolyte/WO3·H2O, and is shown in Fig. 6c. WO3·H2O can be switched from an insulator (IR nonreflecting) to a metal-like compound (IR reflecting) through Li+ intercalation. The fabricated device shows the highest reflectance modulation of 0.41 and 0.53 between the Li+ unintercalated and intercalated states in the 3–5 and 8–12 μm spectral ranges, respectively (Fig. 6d). These results suggest that WO3·H2O-based devices also have large infrared modulation as compared with the anhydrous WO3 and can fulfill the requirements for a good infrared modulator.

To improve the intercalation efficiency of ions and to further promote the EC properties of WO3, nanostructuring is an effective strategy for improving the electrochromic performance. Zhou et al.138 fabricated nanostructured WO3 materials by combining hydrothermal and electrodeposition methods. The electrodeposited a-WO3 shell was intimately coated on the c-WO3 core nanowire forming a 1D core/shell nanowire arrays nanostructure of c-WO3@a-WO3 (Fig. 7a and b). This optimized core/shell nanostructure of c-WO3@a-WO3 film showed the largely improved reflectance modulation in the visible to infrared region (0.703 at 750 nm, 0.42 at 2000 nm and 0.514 at 10 μm) as compared to the WO3 films and WO3 nanowires (Fig. 7c). Due to the large active surface induced by the core–shell structure, fast switching speed (3.5 s and 4.8 s), high coloration efficiency (43.2 cm2 C−1 at 750 nm) and excellent cycling performance (68.5% after 3000 cycles) were also achieved. Cai et al.139 also observed that the WO3 films with special nanostructure could highly enhance the EC performance. They successfully synthesized WO3 arrays with the vertically aligned hierarchical nano-architecture on FTO glass through a template-free solvothermal method. The prepared WO3 arrays showed the different nano-architectures, including nanocluster, nanotree and nanowire arrays when the HCl concentrations were regulated (Fig. 7d). Importantly, the nanostructured WO3 nanotree arrays consisted of a diameter of 50 nm of the WO3 trunk and some branches with diameters of 20 nm and lengths of 150 nm (Fig. 7e). Such nanostructures provide high surface area and short diffusion distance, resulting in remarkable enhanced optical modulation in the visible (66.5% at 633 nm), NIR (73.8% at 2 μm) and mid-infrared ranges (57.7% at 8 μm) (Fig. 7f).

In addition, the doping/embedding of other suitable types of metals also could enhance the EC performance. Cai et al.140 prepared the nanoscale interconnecting Ti-doped WO3 network on FTO-coated glass via a hydrothermal method as shown in Fig. 8a. The as-fabricated 3% Ti-doped WO3 film showed superior EC performance to the undoped one in terms of high optical contrast for both the visible and the near-infrared light spectra regions (i.e., 49.1% at 750 nm and 64.6% at 2000 nm) (Fig. 8b). With suitable amounts of Ti doping, the 1% Ti-doped WO3 film delivered a maximum reflectance modulation of 0.593 at 10 μm (Fig. 8c). The improved IR performance of the Ti-doped WO3 film was attributed to its nanostructure construction that provides numerous active sites and shortens the ions diffusion paths. Similar phenomena were also found for the hybrid TiO2@WO3 materials system. Cai et al.141 synthesized the TiO2@WO3 films with the core/shell nanorod array structure on FTO-coated glass by the combination of the hydrothermal and electrodeposition method (Fig. 8d). By regulating the WO3 content, the EC film based on optimized TiO2@WO3 exhibited not only a larger transmittance modulation (40.3% at 750 nm, 70.3% at 1800 nm) and IR reflectance modulation (38.4% at 10 μm) superior to pure TiO2 and WO3 films (Fig. 8e and f), but also delivered a fast switching speed (2.4 s and 1.6 s), high coloration efficiency (67.5 cm2 C−1 at 750 nm) and better cycling performance (65.1% after 10000 cycles). The performance optimization was due to the large active area of nanosized TiO2@WO3, facilitating the insertion of more ions into the materials. These beneficial attempts have greatly promoted the EC performance of WO3-based IR-ECDs.

3.2 Li4Ti5O12-based infrared electrochromic devices
Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) is extensively used as a promising anode material in lithium-ion batteries due to its notable “zero-strain” characteristic and excellent reversibility for lithium insertion and extraction. In an early report, Li4Ti5O12 was observed to change color from white to dark blue upon lithium insertion under an applied voltage, which implies that Li4Ti5O12 is also a promising active EC material.142 Recently, the electrochromic properties of LTO have exhibited tunable emissivity or reflectivity from visible to infrared wavelengths. For example, Li et al.143 firstly revealed the optical and thermal management performance of Li4Ti5O12 during charging/discharging via computational and theoretical investigation. The simulated reflectivity in the solar spectrum (0.25–2.75 μm) of LTO can be tuned by the amount of intercalated Li (Fig. 9a), and the resulting maximum reflectivity variation was calculated at about 0.35 at 2.5 μm. Within the 3–5 μm and 8–14 μm regions, the reflectivity modulation of LTO became larger, which can be tuned to about 0.41 and 0.46, respectively (Fig. 9b).

In addition, Mandal et al.144 reported the broadband electrochromic properties of Li4Ti5O12 with highly reversible lithium-ion (Li+) intercalation, and exhibited large tunable emissivity or reflectivity as well as excellent thermal stability from visible to infrared wavelengths. Upon Li+ intercalation, LTO changed from a wide band-gap semiconductor (Li4Ti5O12) to a metal (Li7Ti5O12), leading to a drastic change in the optical properties between the two states in the visible to infrared region (Fig. 9c). As shown in Fig. 9d, the measured emissivity tunabilities of ∼0.74, ∼0.68, and ∼0.30 were obtained in the solar spectrum (0.4–2.5 μm), mid-wave infrared (3–5 μm), and long-wave infrared (8–13 μm) regions, respectively. Such emissivity tunabilities achieved by the LTO-based electrodes can allow them to blend with the surroundings by reflecting their environment's temperature (Fig. 9e). Moreover, they also demonstrated the large tunable temperature range (18 °C) and sub-ambient (by 4 °C) temperatures attained by LTO under sunlight, which enabled the promising application for thermal camouflage.
4. Organic infrared electrochromic devices
Organic infrared electrochromic materials have emerged in real-world applications in areas as varied as military camouflage, spacecraft thermal control and smart windows. Compared to most inorganic materials, organic materials exhibit remarkable advantages, such as adjustable molecular structure, rich color options, fast response, simple processing and low manufacturing cost.145,146Table 2 shows the current organic IR-EC materials used for modulating the IR emissivity mainly focused in the conducting polymers, including polythiophene, poly(3-hexyl thiophene), polyaniline and their derivatives.

4.1 PEDOT-based infrared electrochromic devices
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) has been extensively explored in recent years as an ideal IR organic material for IR-ECDs. PEDOT can change color from light blue to dark blue, and can also convert from a high IR transparent state (neutral state) to a high IR emissive state (oxidized state) by applying different voltages. For instance, Louet et al.147 prepared a series of PEDOT films with different dopant anions (ClO4− and TFSI−) on ITO electrodes by a potentiostatic method, which were used for studying IR performance in their doped and dedoped states. In this work, the two sides of the PEDOT:ClO4 film and the PEDOT:TFSI film (side 1 and side 2) indicate a drastic difference in surface morphology (Fig. 10a), resulting in significant reflectivity variation due to scattering phenomena. Side 2 of the PEDOT:ClO4 film and PEDOT:TFSI film exhibited a smooth and flat morphology as compared with side 1 (Fig. 10b and c), which allowed a maximum ΔR with a value of 0.23 for PEDOT:ClO4 (side 2) and 0.32 for PEDOT:TFSI (side 2) between the doped and dedoped states in the wavelength range of 8–20 μm (Fig. 10d). As a result, the IR reflectivity of the PEDOT film with smoother morphology will be enhanced by about 35–40%, as compared to those with rough surface morphologies. They also demonstrated that the significant electronic conductivity variation of the dedoped and doped states of PEDOT films have a direct correlation to IR reflectivity. To date, further studies have integrated PEDOT for use in ECDs to design an organic emissive infrared modulator. Due to the innovation of the device structure and the excellent conductivity of PEDOT, some types of PEDOT-based infrared ECDs have been reported and further expand the infrared ECD application field.

To date, further studies have integrated the PEDOT for use in ECDs to design an organic emissive infrared modulator. The development of PEDOT-based devices with semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN) macromolecular architecture is a common configuration for exploring IR performances. IPN, commonly consisting of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR), can be regarded as a combination of two polymer networks synthesized and/or cross-linked in the presence of each other.148 The IPN exhibits the function of simplifying the device structure and improving mechanical properties. Petroffe et al.149 studied the influence of different ionic liquids on the IR optical properties of semi-IPN electro-emissive devices based on PEDOT. The fabricated device doped with ionic liquid had the largest reflectivity variation of 0.29 in the range of 2.5–20 μm. Teissier et al.150 investigated the infrared emissivity regulations of semi-IPNs electro-emissive devices based on PEDOT and demonstrated the feasibility for the thermal control of satellites. The devices exhibit a maximal emissivity contrast of 0.31 in 5–50 μm with a switching time of less than 3 min. Goujon et al.151 developed an all semi-IPN device made of an active layer of semi-IPN and two gold-metalized pieces (Fig. 11a). The as-prepared semi-IPN has a three-layer system, where the PEDOT layer was interpenetrated into the NBR/PEO for the working electrode and counter electrode, and a central part (NBR/PEO) containing ionic liquid electrolyte was the supporting matrix (Fig. 11b). When increasing the applied voltage from −2.5 to 1.5 V, the device showed the transition from the low reflectance state (reduced state) to the high reflectance (oxidized state) state, resulting in reflectance modulation of about 26% and 41% in the 3–5 μm and the 8–12 μm regions, respectively (Fig. 11c). Furthermore, the device exhibited good mechanical properties, even suffering bending and rolling up due to the presence of the soft and flexible NBR network. As the PEDOT' amount increases, the stress at break of the device can increase from 1.2 to 8.2 MPa with an elongation at break of between 84% and 14% (Fig. 11d). Notably, the devices with similar configurations have demonstrated good thermal regulation performance under conditions close to the space environment (−25 °C to +80 °C), as well as excellent cyclability (>4000 cycles) and a switching time of less than 3 min. These results indicate that IR-ECDs with configurations based on PEDOT could provide a new method for thermal control application.

Benefitting from the high conductivity and EC features, the PEDOT material could serve as the IR-EC active layer, and can also be used as a current collector instead of metal electrodes (ITO or gold), which makes it possible to design flexible and robust free-conducting electrode IR-ECDs. Based on this design, Brooke et al.152 proposed two types of metal-free flexible infrared electrochromic device-based PEDOT:Tos films (Fig. 12a), in which the PEDOT:Tos film can sufficiently conduct as electrodes, and also show IR electrochromic characteristics between the oxidized and the reduced states. The lateral device exhibited a significant modulation in the emissivity of about 15.3% between the reduced and oxidized state over both the visible and IR regions (Fig. 12b). In addition, lateral and vertical electrochromic devices further exhibited effective temperature differences of about 10 °C and 7 °C, respectively, as well as good optical memory (∼10 hours), fast switching speed (1.9 s, and 3.3 s) and good continuous cyclic stability (∼100 cycles). Apart from the variable emissivity or reflectivity IR-ECDs, the transparent IR-ECDs have also demonstrated IR modulation capacity. Kim et al.153 presented a design of transmissive IR-ECDs by using PEDOT film as a working electrode and grid-patterned PEDOT as a counter electrode (Fig. 12c). The device with optimized architecture delivered a high transmittance contrast ratio of 25% at a wavelength of 6–14 μm under the voltages of +2.5 and −2.5 V (Fig. 12d). Moreover, it showed stable temperature changes from 31.1 to 34.0 °C between the neutral state (−2.5 V) and the doped state (+2.5 V) (Fig. 12e). Benefiting from the grid electrodes, this device showed stable cyclability, as there was no significant degradation after 20 cycles, while the device without grid-patterned PEDOT dropped by more than 70% after 20 cycles (Fig. 12f). The excellent cyclability can be attributed to the grid-patterned PEDOT reducing gold degradation while maintaining transparency.

However, the IR performance of PEDOT is still far from the requirements of further commercial applications. Optimizing the polymer molecular structure of PEDOT has been regarded as an efficient method to improve the IR modulation performance. Dimethyl substituted poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) (PProDOT-Me2), as a derivative of PEDOT, is also an outstanding candidate material in IR-ECDs. Schwendeman et al.154 reported a dual polymer ECD, which was composed of PProDOT-Me2 active EC layer and [3,6-bis(2-(3,4-ethylenedioxy)thienyl)-N-methylcarbazole] (PBEDOT-NMeCz) counter electrode with reversible diffusion of the gel electrolyte between the two electrodes (Fig. 13a). Specifically, remarkable reflectance modulation in the visible, NIR, and mid-IR regions were achieved via transition of the neutral, doped and undoped state of PProDOT-Me2. By applying difference voltage, a reflectance modulation of 55%, 80%, 50% in the visible, 1.3–2.2 μm, 3.5–5.0 μm regions, respectively (Fig. 13b). Good flexibility, short switching time within 3 s and long-term stability for 6 days were also obtained. In addition, Holt et al.85 developed two types of transmissive IR-ECDs-based poly (3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) (Fig. 13c). To maximize the transmittance modulation of P3HT in the 2–6 μm region, ITO-coated double polished silicon wafers and germanium wafers were used as IR transparent electrode substrates. By regulating the salt type, salt concentration and polymer film thicknesses, a maximum transmittance modulation of 30% was achieved by switching the deactivated state and activated state in the 2–6 μm region. In addition, simple doping of PEDOT has also been realized as an efficient and facile method for improving the infrared properties of the devices. Tan et al.155 developed a new type of device composed of the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), gold-coated non-porous polyimide substrate and gel electrolyte. For the high-performance PEDOT active films and devices, poly (styrenesulfonate) (PSS) was introduced as an effective doping acid to prepare the PSS-doped-PEDOT (PEDOT/PSS) film via the potentiostatic method. Some properties of PEDOT/PSS film, such as high electronic conductivity, low redox potentials can be obtained. The PEDOT/PSS film with polymerization charges of 1.0C deposited on the non-porous substrate displayed a much smoother and more homogeneous topography with small-grained particles (Fig. 13d). As a result, the as-prepared device showed a larger reflectance contrast of 0.566 in 3–5 μm, effective temperature changes of approximately 16 °C, and exhibited a fast switching time (1.5 s and 9.4 s) (Fig. 13e and f), which can be applied in military camouflage against thermal detection and satellite thermal control.

4.2 PANI-based infrared electrochromic devices
PANI not only achieves color changes in the visible region, but also exhibits high IR emissivity adjustment capability in the infrared region. It is known that the dynamic IR properties of PANI depend on polaron generation and elimination from their different redox states. In an earlier report, Chandrasekhar et al.156 first reported IR electrochromic performances in conducting polymers and assembled a flexible IR electrochromic device by utilizing the polymeric (poly(diphenyl amine) (PDPA))-doped PANI films (PANI/PDPA) as the conducting polymer deposited on the Au-covered microporous membrane, which delivered a dynamic variation of infrared emissivity from 0.32 to 0.79 in the region of 2.5–45 μm. The obtained device also exhibited flexibility, fast switching speed (<2 s), excellent stability (1–3 × 105 cycles), optical memory (3 days) and temperature durability (−35 °C to +85 °C). Through this significant study, a variety of PANI-based IR-ECDs have been explored and developed widely for potential use as military camouflage and spacecraft intelligent thermal control. It is worth noting that the acid dopant is the main factor affecting the IR electrochromic performances of PANI. The currently reported PANI with different EC abilities are mainly doped with single acids, including inorganic acids (such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and perchloric acid (HClO4)) and organic acids (such as camphor sulfonic acid (CSA), and dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (DBSA)). For example, Li et al.157 adopted Chandrasekhar's patented device design to study the electrochromic properties of IR-ECDs based on PANI with a H2SO4 dopant. However, the device yielded a low performance with an average dynamic emissivity variation of 0.24 in 8–12 μm. Research and progress on the improvement of the IR performance of H2SO4-doped PANI devices are under development. Sun et al.158 proposed self-powered flexible IR-ECDs, in which H2SO4-doped PANI film deposited on Au/PES and Au/PET substrates were selected as the electrochromic and ion storage layers, respectively (Fig. 14a). By applying a reversible bias of ±0.8 V, the device exhibited an average reflectance modulation of 0.46 in the 8–14 μm region (Fig. 14b), as well as thermal control. The device could be integrated with a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) system, which exhibited the potential for use in self-powered camouflage and thermal control applications. In addition, Xu et al.159 synthesized H2SO4-doped PANI films on an Au deposited nylon 66 porous substrate to prepare a visible-to-infrared broadband flexible electrochromic device, which yielded high infrared emissivity changes of 0.4 and 0.3 in the wavelength ranges of 8–14 μm and 2.5–25 μm, respectively. Moreover, noticeable thermal regulation performances at different oxidation states were observed via IR camera, demonstrating the thermal camouflage function (Fig. 14c). Zhang et al.160 prepared HClO4-doped PANI films via in situ electrochemical deposition on an Au/microporous substrate and assembled them in flexible IR-ECDs. This device showed a higher IR emissivity modulation of 0.419 at different redox states in the wavelength range of 2.5–25 μm (Fig. 14d). In addition, this study revealed that the realized emissivity modulation was mainly responsible for the existence and elimination of polarons and bipolarons delocalized on PANI chains. For organic acids-doped PANI, Topart's group67 designed the non-flexible IR-ECDs based on CSA-doped PANI film. By applying potentials from −0.2 to 0.45 V, the specular reflectance of the device could be continually adjusted between 0.2 and 0.65 at 12 μm. Besides, Li et al.161 developed a flexible IR electrochromic device by introducing DBSA-doped PANI film as the active layer, a poly (ether ether ketone) (PEEK) porous membrane with high liquid electrolyte loading as the electrolyte layer. By taking advantage of the porous structure of PEEK, continuously high-speed ion transfer channels could be obtained. As result, the device exhibited significantly improved Δε, i.e. 0.47, 0.25 and 0.48 in the wavelength ranges of 2.5–25 μm, 3–5 μm and 8–14 μm, respectively, fast switching time (<10 s) and good cycling stability. These studies above provided potential methods along with promising candidates for thermal management, energy saving, and other applications of PANI-based ECDs.

Although the above PANI-based IR-ECDs showed promising IR tunability properties and some potential applications, the intrinsic inferior electrochemical stability of the molecular structure of PANI during the charge exchanging process remains a significant challenge. For this issue, molecular modification will be an efficient strategy to achieve improvement in the IR modulation performance of PANI. It is generally desirable to use the copolymerization method by combining the advantages of both monomers, resulting in better electrochemical or optical properties for copolymers. Chandrasekhar et al.162 prepared a copolymer film containing aniline and diphenylamine with polymeric materials as the dopant. The optimized devices have achieved some breakthrough developments, such as space durability (>7 months), high flexibility, fast switching times of 6–9 s, as well as larger emissivity variation exceeding 0.47. Such the device design was lightweight and inexpensive, and suitable for the design of small spacecraft for thermal control. In addition, Wu et al.163 successfully synthesized an IR electrochromic copolymer film composed of aniline and o-anisidine. The as-synthesized film was composed of countless particles and the particles were uniformly distributed (Fig. 15a). In addition, it showed an average emissivity dynamic of the copolymer film of 0.408 in the wavelength range of 8–14 μm by applying different potentials, which revealed the enhancement of the emissivity in the copolymer as compared to the polyaniline film (Fig. 15b). Zhang et al.164 prepared a new copolymer of aniline and o-nitroaniline via the electrochemical polymerization method, which realized fast response times (1.89 s and 4.47 s), high coloration efficiency, more color variation (apple green, dark green, and blue), significant optical modulation (60% at 500 nm) and a large average emissivity modulation of 0.203 in the wavelength range of 2.5–25 μm as compared to the single component. Wang et al.165 designed a series of H2SO4-doped novel binary copolymer films (PFANI, PCANI and PBANI) by electro-polymerizing aniline and haloaniline monomers on porous Au electrodes, and employed them to fabricate IR electro-emissive devices based on a “sandwich structure” including two EC copolymer films as both front and back electrodes and an electrolyte membrane between the two electrodes (Fig. 15c). Among these copolymer films, the PFANI film presents the maximum emittance modulation of 0.417 in 8–14 μm, which is higher than that of pure PANI film (0.388). Moreover, the PFANI-based electro-emissive device achieved the highest IR emissivity modulation capability (Δε = 0.312) at 2.5–25 μm (Fig. 15d).

PANI can also be composited with other nanomaterials to form new hybrid EC materials, which is another efficient and facile method for obtaining better EC properties. Wang et al.166 developed a novel PANI/Au composite film with a neoteric mosaic structure by using the galvanostatic method (Fig. 16a). The as-prepared PANI/Au film displayed IR emissivity variation of 0.552 at 13 μm between the leucoemeraldine base (LB) and emeraldine salt (ES) state. This obvious improvement in performance was due to the synergistic effect of Au particles and PANI and the local surface plasma resonance (LSPR) phenomenon, eventually achieving the improvement of electron conduction efficiency and the optimized morphologies of polymer films. Beyond that, the electro-emissive devices (EEDs) based on PANI/Au composite films showed a change in IR emissivity (Δε) as high as 0.402 in the wavelength range of 8–14 μm (Fig. 16b), as well as excellent thermal regulation capability. Xu et al.167 prepared a new composite EC film composed of PANI and MXene through a wet chemical method followed by the chemical polymerization technique. The PANI was successfully polymerized on the surface and between layers of MXene (Fig. 16c). As a result, the dual-function electrochromic device-based MXene/PANI yielded an IR emittance modulation of 0.39 at 8–14 μm between the oxidized and reduced state (Fig. 16d). In addition, different thermal radiation capabilities were also observed in the oxidized and reduced states (Fig. 16e).

However, considering the continuous energy supply needed for driving PANI-based ECDs operation, the development of advanced IR-ECDs with low energy consumption is desirable. Our group has recently been making some advances in PANI-based IR-ECDs design, regulation mechanism, fabrication, as well as characterization. We have proposed a flexible self-driven IR-ECD based on PANI, which was constructed for achieving variable optical and thermal management in a low-energy mode.168 The fabrication process is described in Fig. 17a. In the device configuration, the PANI cathode, Al foil anode and a gel electrolyte were integrated into the device assembly. This device could operate with nearly zero energy consumption by manipulating the contact of the cathode and anodes instead of applying external voltage. Self-driven bleaching occurred as soon as the PANI electrode and Al foil were connected. The device changed from a low IR reflection state to a high IR reflection state (Fig. 17b), which endowed the device with average temperature modulation of 5.6 °C between the two states (Fig. 17c). Note that the optical and thermal management processes are reversible and energy-efficient because the device could integrate with the solar panel without requiring additional electrical connections. The device also exhibited reflectance tunability in the ranges of 0.2–2.5 μm and 8–14 μm as high as ∼0.2 and ∼0.11 under a reversible bias of 0.4 and 2.0 V (Fig. 17d). For other performances, the switching time (∼6 s), high CE (93.6 cm2 C−1 at 1500 nm) and good stability (steadily operating up to 60 fully reversible cycles) were also achieved.

5. Conclusions and outlook
With the development of EC technology, the construction of advanced ECDs with IR modulation behavior has attracted increasing interest and many great advances have been made in recent years. Nonetheless, there is still a long way to go for the development of high-performance IR-ECDs and the achievement of their real-world applications.
5.1 Preparation of the IR-ECDs
The IR-ECDs usually involve a multi-layered structure, which inevitably brings complex and expensive manufacturing processes. Substantial improvements in the cost-to-performance ratio by adopting low-cost manufacturing pathways equipped with new functionalities to meet the strict price and performance consideration are still encouraged. Thus, it is urgent to design low-cost synthesis routes for high-performance IR-modulating ECDs and advanced assembly processes for large-area devices still need to be developed and improved. It is worthwhile to optimize the device design toward robust and simple structures for more cost-effective devices.
5.2 Boosting the performance of the IR-ECDs
To meet the requirements of real-world applications, it is necessary to improve the EC performance of the IR-ECDs. Firstly, the operation life and cycling performance need to be enhanced. Considering the inevitable degradation of EC materials, electrolytes, etc., more attention should be paid to the exploitation of suitable device materials with better chemical/electrochemical stabilities to extend the cycling life of the device. Further understanding of the IR electrochromic materials' characteristics is critical to promote the performance and enhance the stability in terms of structures and optical performances. The optimization of electrolytes should also be taken into account. For example, electrolytes with higher ion conductivity, larger operation voltage and excellent stability are necessary.
5.3 Energy recovery from the IR-ECDs
The IR-ECDs usually require a continuous supply of external electric energy to maintain stable performance. In spite of a low applied voltage, there is still considerable energy consumption during the long-term operation of the IR-ECDs. The memory effect of an ECD is the ability to maintain a given redox state after cutting off the electric supply, which means allowing the electrochromic device to maintain EC characteristics without a continuous power supply. Hence, the recent requirements for IR modulating ECDs demand that they should not only simultaneously regulate the IR performance but should also maintain a high or low IR irradiative state without a continuous power supply for some time. Another challenge is to balance the device performance and energy-saving maximization. A future development trend is to develop low-voltage driven IR electrochromic materials or devices for saving more electric energy, which may significantly expand the practical applications of IR-ECDs. The integration of IR-EC technology with energy storage may effectively reduce the energy consumption and should gain considerable attention for future development.
Herein, the latest advances and progress of the IR-ECDs have been reviewed and discussed in detail. Some critical performance metrics in terms of emittance/reflectance modulation, switching time, thermal management and cycling stability, are the basis of the measurement and evaluation of IR electrochromic materials and devices. We also illustrate the classification of IR electrochromic materials, which is mainly divided into transition metal oxides and conducting polymers. Importantly, the infrared modulation mechanism of these active materials is also systematically summarized, which could provide basic principles for the design of high-performance IR-ECDs. Extensive studies have been carried out to improve the IR properties, including the enhancement of the IR reflectance/emittance modulation, switching speed, thermal management and cycling stability, by utilizing the strategies of device structure optimization, nanostructuring, metal doping and nanocompositing. In addition, IR-ECDs can achieve a self-power supply by integrating them into the energy harvesting technology, such as photovoltaic (converting solar radiation into useable electricity) and nanogenerator-driven systems (collecting other energies, such as mechanical energy), towards developing multi-functional devices, which is urgent and attractive for future practical applications. It is envisaged that more advanced IR electrochromic materials and advanced technologies are constantly developing, and will be developed to realize extensive applications in smart windows, infrared military camouflage, thermoregulation in spacecraft and so on.
