    , Accepted 23rd February 2015First published on 23rd February 2015AbstractManipulating Ag nanowire (AgNW) assembly to tailor the opto-electrical properties and surface morphology could improve the performance of next-generation transparent conductive electrodes. In this paper, we demonstrated a water-bath assisted convective assembly process at the temporary water/alcohol interface for fabricating hierarchical aligned AgNW electrodes. The convection flow plays an important role during the assembly process. The assembled AgNW film fabricated via three times orthogonal dip-coating at a water-bath temperature of 80 °C has a sheet resistance of 11.4 Ω sq−1 with 89.9% transmittance at 550 nm. Moreover, the root mean square (RMS) of this assembled AgNW film was only 15.6 nm which is much lower than the spin-coated random AgNW film (37.6 nm) with a similar sheet resistance. This facile assembly route provides a new way for manufacturing and tailoring ordered nanowire-based devices.
Introduction
Due to the emergence of flexible plastic devices and the scarcity of indium resources, finding novel transparent conductive electrode (TCE) materials to replace indium tin oxide (ITO) becomes more urgent. Recent research has focused on several alternatives including conductive polymers,1 carbon nanotubes,2–5 graphene,6,7 metal grids8 and silver nanowires (AgNWs).9–11 Among them, AgNWs with their high conductivity, excellent flexibility and solution processing have proven to be the most promising candidate alternative to ITO and competing amorphous oxides.12 AgNW networks can be achieved by many means, such as spin-coating,13,14 drop-casting,9,15 rod-coating16,17 and spray-coating.18,19 However, the high contact resistance from the loose contact between individual AgNWs and high topological roughness due to AgNWs aggregation remain a critical issue, thus making extra processing steps necessary in order to achieve low sheet resistance values, high transmittance and uniform surface for practical applications. Many strategies have been proposed to address this issue, including mechanical pressing,16,20 vacuum filtration,12,21 metal-oxide nanoparticle fusing or surface encapsulation,22,23 nanoscale joule heating24,25 and plasmonic welding process.26,27 While concerning a rapid production process, some of these methods are time-consuming and energy-consuming. This suggests a need for tunable, novel and scalable approaches to fabricate AgNW films.
For random AgNW films, the insufficient wire–wire cross-junction is also a critical defect. Most of the AgNWs pile up to form high peaks during general random film processes so that a few wire–wire cross-junctions are formed using a single AgNW. To overcome this drawback, a layered and aligned AgNW film is required. Metallic nanowire assemblies offer a wide variety of potential applications with improved performance. Many of these assembly techniques have been developed to fabricate the aligned nanowire films. For instance, the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) technique has been used to align nanowires at the air/water interface by assisted surface compression and applied in nanoelectronic devices or as sensing substrates for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).28–30 Fluid flows and rheological behavior were employed to direct the nanowires to form well-ordered structures due to the shear flow, and this offered a general pathway for bottom-up assembly of nanosystems.31,32 Blown bubble film techniques,33 dielectrophoretic techniques34,35 and stirring-assisted assembly36 have also been introduced to align nanowires. Recently, self-assemblies of AgNWs between two-phase or three-phase (e.g., air/water, water/oil, and oil/water/air) interfaces have attracted great interest due to their unique structures and potential applications in nanoscale electronics and optoelectronics.37–39 Most multi-phase interface assemblies reported are focused on an oil/water immiscible interface. Very few studies have been carried out at the water/alcohol miscible interface.
In this paper, we report a facile route to fabricate monolayer aligned AgNW films via water-bath assisted convective self-assembly at a temporary water/alcohol interface and then transfer these aligned AgNWs onto a glass substrate to form ordered multilayer AgNW (OM-AgNW) films by dip-coating orthogonally to the previous layer. The thickness, optical transmittance and sheet resistance of OM-AgNW films can be easily tailored by varying the water-bath temperature and the number of dip-coating cycles. The OM-AgNW film obtained via three times orthogonal dip-coating at an optimum water-bath temperature of 80 °C exhibited a superior performance of 11.4 Ω sq−1 sheet resistance and 89.9% transmittance at 550 nm. The improved performance of the OM-AgNW film can be attributed to the hierarchical aligned nanowire structure enhancing the number of wire–wire cross-junctions between nanowires and reducing nanowire aggregation.
Experimental
AgNW suspensions in isopropanol and in water (AW030-L, 1 wt%) were purchased from Kechuang Advanced Materials Technology Co., Ltd (Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China). The employed AgNWs have an average diameter and length of approximately 25 nm and 20 μm, respectively. In order to minimize agglomeration of AgNWs, the purchased AgNW isopropanol suspension was diluted in isopropanol to form a 0.12 wt% AgNW dispersion. Ultrapure water (resistivity 18.2 MΩ cm, Sciencetool Co., Ltd) was added into a glass beaker. Then, the beaker was placed into a water-bath trough and heated. 150 μL of a prepared AgNW isopropanol dispersion was added onto the hot water surface drop by drop using a pipette. The location of the drop was kept near the center of the water surface to make AgNWs spread out effectively. 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 glass substrates were cleaned with acetone, deionized water and isopropanol each for 10 min in an ultrasonic bath. To avoid deposition on the back-sides, two glass substrates were clamped back to back when dip-coating. An automatic dip-coater was used to transfer the assembled film to the glass substrates. A 2000 μm s−1 pull-out velocity was applied during transfer. Random AgNW films for the control group were prepared by spin-coating multiple times at 1500 rpm with the same diluted AgNW isopropanol dispersion. Both the self-assembled AgNW films and the spin-coated AgNW films were then heated on the hotplate at 100 °C for 5 min to evaporate the remaining solvent.
In the device fabrication, a PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP Al 4083) layer was deposited by spin-coating onto the AgNW networks at 2500 rpm for 60 s, and annealed at 120 °C for 10 min. The rest of the device fabrication steps were carried out in the nitrogen glove box. A 2 wt% 1:0.8 P3HT:PC61BM (American Dye Source, Inc.) blend from dichlorobenzene was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer at 800 rpm for 45 s following a 7 h solvent annealing in a covered Petri dish. After annealing at 120 °C for 10 min, a Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm) cathode was thermally deposited at 2 × 10−6 Torr. All device areas were 0.15 cm2.
The optical transmittance spectra of the films were measured using a UV-vis spectrometer (Agilent Technologies 8453). The surface morphology of the AgNWs was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ZEISS Ultra 55) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, NT-MDT). The sheet resistances of the films were measured using a four-point probe system (KD-1, Kunde Technology Co., Guangzhou, China). Each of the sheet resistances reported is the average value obtained after at least ten multiple measurements. The J–V performance of the devices was determined by means of a solar simulator (Oriel model 91160) and a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit. All J–V characteristics were obtained in the dark and under 100 mW cm−2 of AM 1.5 G illumination.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the schematic of the self-assembly of monolayer AgNW fabrication processes. Fig. 1b–f compares the SEM images of self-assembly monolayer AgNW films fabricated by one dip-coating at room temperature (RT), 50 °C, 70 °C, 80 °C, and 90 °C, respectively. Distinct differences between the self-assembled films with and without a water-bath were the surface coverage and alignment of the AgNWs. At room temperature, a random AgNW mesh was formed by dip-coating. The surface coverage of AgNW mesh fabricated at RT was not uniform and AgNW aggregation can be observed. This is similar to the situation reported by Sachse et al.40 A certain scale of ordered AgNW monolayer was obtained when the water-bath temperature was increased from RT to 50 °C (Fig. 1c). The surface coverage of AgNWs on the substrate became uniform and the AgNW build-up effect did not occur. The interval of two adjacent AgNWs was reduced and better dense ordered AgNW arrays were formed as the water-bath temperature increased.

The improvement in the morphology of the AgNW monolayer using a water-bath should be attributed to the likelihood of temperature enhancing solvent convection flow-induced AgNW self-assembly. During water-bath heating, the liquid convection circulation has an uprising stream at the center of solvent and down-flowing stream near the beaker wall caused by the nonuniform temperature (Fig. 1a). Generally, when a small droplet of an aqueous surfactant is slowly dropped on a thin water surface, the gravitational forces can be neglected and the droplet of the aqueous surfactant will not dissolve into the water immediately but spread first due to the Marangoni effect.41 In our experiments, the same phenomenon was observed when dropping isopropanol on the water surface. Without a water-bath, when dropping the AgNW isopropanol dispersion on the water surface, AgNWs quickly sedimented in the water due to the gravity and the convective flow of weak nature though they had the tendency to spread (Fig. S1a, initial, ESI†). As a result, a AgNW water–isopropanol mixed solvent dispersion was formed and became more and more opaque as the number of drops in the AgNW dispersion increased (Fig. S1a, final, ESI†). In contrast, when AgNW isopropanol dispersion was dropped on a hot ultrapure water surface, the droplet was not sedimented immediately but stayed on the water surface and spread out (Fig. S1b, initial, ESI†). This can be attributed the hypothesis that the uprising stream toward the evaporating liquid surface exerted enough drag of the droplet to overcome the gravity (at least temporarily) and there was enough time for the AgNWs isopropanol dispersion to spread out before sedimentation. During the process, a water/alcohol interface is temporarily formed and the enhanced solvent flow along the water/alcohol surface drives AgNWs and makes them orientate and align due to the shear force caused by the convection flow. AgNWs then gradually self-assembled at the water/air interface as the isopropanol evaporated and appeared as a shiny mirror-like thin interfacial layer (Fig. S1b, final, ESI†). Finally, the high surface tension of water can allow the self-assembled AgNWs to float on the water surface rather than sediment with the downflowing stream (Fig. S1b, ESI†). This solvent flow induced nanowire assembly similar to previous evaporating droplet and convective assembly reported by M. C. P. Wang et al.42 and Huang Y. et al.31 As they reported, the movement of a fluid or solid object against a second fluid or solid object can create a shear force. The orientation of the nanowire dispersion can be realigned by the shear force and the reorientation of the nanowires will be parallel to the direction of the corresponding force. The similarity of our results with those of Huang Y. et al.31 indicate that the similar model can be used to explain the assembly of AgNWs here. Therefore, shear forces might be the main force for the initial assembly of the AgNWs at the temporary water/alcohol interface.
The influence of the shear force has been further investigated. In our experiments, when the AgNW isopropanol dispersion was replaced by AgNW water dispersion to drop on the hot water surface, the droplet of AgNW water dispersion sedimented and redispersed into the water directly and no assembly was observed (Fig. S1c, ESI†). The same sedimentation has been obtained when dropping the AgNW isopropanol dispersion on a hot isopropanol surface (Fig. S1d, ESI†). In both experiments, for the homogeneous solvent, weak shear forces were created during the dropping process though there was an enhanced solvent convection flow in the beaker. Furthermore, the low surface tension of the isopropanol could not exert enough drag on the AgNWs to float on the hot isopropanol surface. Therefore, it could not be assembled to drop the AgNW dispersion on the hot surface of the homogeneous solvent. Other properties such as viscosity, surface tension, boiling point and density may have an influence on the assembly process. The relative effect of the parameters on the assembled AgNW film will be further investigated and optimized.
To explain the effect of the water-bath temperature on the performance of monolayer AgNWs, the absorption spectra of AgNWs from the solvent under the water/air interface have been measured (Fig. 2). The reducing absorption spectra with the increasing water-bath temperature further indicated that the temperature enhancing the convection flow contributed to the initial assembly of the AgNWs. As the temperature increased, the droplet would suffer from stronger drag due to the enhanced uprising stream and obtain more time to spread out before sedimentation. Consequently, there were more nanowires self-assembled at the water/air interface. Thus, the number of AgNWs sedimented into the water would reduce with increase of the water-bath temperature. This is consistent with the much greater coverage and density variation of the aligned AgNWs in Fig. 1c–f.

In consideration of the rapid production process of the aligned AgNW film, our method is quite flexible and simple. As a result, this method should work as long as the temperature of the self-assembled solvent is higher than the room temperature. The deposition process was repeated to fabricate layered three-dimensional (3D) crosswire structures simply by rotating the substrate orthogonally to the deposition direction of the previous layer (Fig. 3a). OM-AgNW films have been fabricated to evaluate the optical and electrical properties of such a self-assembled AgNW electrodes. In general, the optical transmittance and sheet resistance (Rsq) are expressed by:43   where σOp is the optical conductivity and σDC is the DC conductivity of the film. A transparent electrode is commonly rated by a figure of merit, the ratio of DC to optical conductivity (σDC/σOp). A high performance electrode should maintain a low sheet resistance and a high optical transmittance, which corresponds to a high value of σDC/σOp. Fig. 3b compares the optoelectrical performance of OM-AgNW films fabricated at the different water-bath temperatures and number of dip-coating layers. It can be seen that both the sheet resistance and optical transmittance decrease upon increasing the dip-coating layer number at the same water-bath temperature or increasing the water-bath temperature at the same dip-coating layer number. The transmittance spectra of the corresponding OM-AgNW films are shown in the ESI,† Fig. S2. Fig. S3 (ESI†) demonstrates AFM images of the AgNW films with the different layers at the water-bath temperature of 80 °C. The RMS of the corresponding AgNW films increased from 8.2 nm of one layer to 25.4 nm of five layers. More detailed sheet resistances of OM-AgNW films to the different water-bath temperatures and dip-coating layer number are listed in the ESI,† Table S1. For all the self-assembled monolayer AgNW films, sheet resistances were not obtained. This indicates that the same orientation of AgNWs leads to few crosswire junctions between the AgNWs to form a desirable inter-wire conductive path. However, when the substrates were rotated through 90° towards the deposition direction of the last layer and repeated dip-coating, hierarchical 3D crosswire AgNW structures were achieved, resulting in an enhancement of the contact pathway between nanowires. In addition, for all the AgNW films dip-coated within 5 cycles at RT, no sheet resistance was observed. This may be attributed to the non-continuous coverage of the nanowires on the substrates under room temperature. The values of σDC/σOp deduced from the best-fit curves in Fig. 3b improve from 250 to 302 as the water-bath temperature increases from 50 °C to 80 °C. However, the value begins to drop at a higher water-bath temperature such as 90 °C. The higher water-bath temperature results in a smaller interval of two adjacent AgNWs. Therefore, more crosswire junctions on AgNWs can be obtained after deposition of the follow-up ordered AgNW layers, improving the overall conductivity of the AgNW films. On the other hand, the excessively narrow span of two adjacent AgNWs can make the optical transmittance of the AgNW films poor, leading to a relatively lower value of σDC/σOp. OM-AgNW film by three times orthogonal dip-coating at a water-bath temperature of 80 °C exhibited an optimum sheet resistance of 11.4 Ω sq−1 and transmittance of 89.9% at 550 nm.

(b) Comparison of the opto-electrical performance of the OM-AgNW films from the different water-bath temperatures and dip-coating layer number. 

Fig. 4a and b show the SEM images of OM-AgNW films fabricated by two and three times orthogonal dip-coating at 80 °C. As a comparison, shown in Fig. 4c, the random AgNW film was fabricated by spin-coating and controlled at a similar sheet resistance with the OM-AgNW film fabricated by three times orthogonal dip-coating at 80 °C. It can be seen that the coverage of AgNW network is very uniform and ordered after multi-dip-coating deposition. This uniform coverage can enhance wire–wire cross-chance and reduce the overall roughness of the film. A hierarchical ordered AgNW structure can make the distribution of wire–wire cross-nodes more uniform and form a more continuous conductive path relative to the random stacking structure. For the spin-coated random AgNW film, nanowire aggregation and stacking occur, leading to less wire–wire cross-chance and higher film roughness. In addition, the transmittance of the AgNW film by spin-coating is lower than that of the OM-AgNW film obtained via dip-coating due to more AgNWs stacking in order to obtain the similar sheet resistance (Fig. 5). The inset of Fig. 5 significantly illustrates AgNW aggregation at four corners during the spin-coating process, resulting in those four corner areas of the random AgNW film being darker than the center.

Random AgNW networks cannot make full use of each single AgNW to form a large-scale continuous film. As described above, more AgNWs are required to reduce the sheet resistance of the random AgNW film to the similar sheet resistance level of the OM-AgNW film. Excessive AgNWs result in more AgNW agglomeration to aggravate optical performance and topography of the AgNW films. Fig. 6a shows a typical atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of the spin-coated AgNW film with Rsq = 11.8 Ω sq−1. The RMS roughness of the film reached 37.6 nm and the peak-to-valley height was about 192 nm, which indicates that there may be seven AgNWs vertically stacking together estimated from the single AgNW with an average diameter of 25 nm. Such high roughness has a serious effect on organic device fabrication due to the great risk of shorting between two electrodes in the stack structure. The AFM image of three times dip-coated AgNW film with Rsq = 11.4 Ω sq−1 is plotted in Fig. 6b. The RMS roughness and peak-to-valley height were significantly reduced to 15.6 nm and 78 nm, respectively, which is consistent with three layers of aligned AgNWs stacking by dip-coating three times. This low roughness is very helpful for the electrodes of the organic devices.

In order to investigate the performance for practical application of the OM-AgNW electrodes in organic devices, organic solar cells were fabricated based upon the following architecture: glass/AgNWs/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PC61BM/Ca/Al. Fig. 7 shows the current–voltage characteristics of the organic solar cells with random AgNWs and OM-AgNWs as the transparent anodes under 100 mW cm−2 of AM 1.5 G illumination and in the dark. It can be seen that the random AgNW device shows a low short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc). The random stacking AgNW network fabricated by spin-coating leads to AgNWs tilted out of plane towards the top electrode, suggesting a potential for shorting of the device. However, the Jsc and Voc are significantly increased from 7.10 mA cm−2 to 9.12 mA cm−2 and 0.51 V to 0.58 V for the OM-AgNW anode due to AgNWs being mostly parallel to the glass substrate. From the dark J–V curve (Fig. 7b), the shunt resistance was calculated to increase from 0.47 kΩ cm2 to 8.47 kΩ cm2. The corresponding power conversion efficiency (PCE) was increased from 1.72% to 2.94%. We note that the literature reports of devices using a similar architecture and ITO as the bottom electrode reached similar efficiencies,13,44 demonstrating the applicability of OM-AgNW films as an alternative to ITO.

Conclusions
We report a novel and facile approach to fabricate ordered monolayer AgNW films via water-bath assisted convective self-assembly. The introduction of a water-bath makes a remarkable difference in manipulating nanowire assembly. The surface coverage of AgNWs on the substrate and the interval between two adjacent AgNWs can be adjusted by varying the water-bath temperature. Hierarchical aligned AgNW films can be formed simply by a repeated orthogonal dip-coating process. The optical and electrical properties of the aligned AgNW electrode can be tailored by adjusting the temperature and the number of deposited layers. Three layers of OM-AgNW film fabricated at a water-bath temperature of 80 °C obtained a maximum value of σDC/σOp = 302. The RMS of the corresponding AgNW film was only 15.6 nm. Organic solar cells fabricated on this OM-AgNW electrode reached a PCE of 2.94%. In conclusion, the approach described here has a great potential for being generalized to other metal nanowires and a range of plastic substrates for applications beyond organic photovoltaic devices.
