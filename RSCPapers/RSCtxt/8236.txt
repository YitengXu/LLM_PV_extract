    , Accepted 5th September 2019First published on 6th September 2019AbstractA helical perylene diimide oligomer (PDI2) is gradually emerging as a promising building block for the construction of organic optoelectronic materials. Motivated by the advancements made in earlier studies by our and other groups, in this contribution, a PDI2 tetramer based non-fullerene small molecule acceptor (SMA), namely SF-4PDI2, was designed and synthesized. Thanks to the orthogonal configuration of the 9,9′-spirobifluorene (SF) core, the resultant SMA shows a highly twisted 3D geometry, which can avoid the formation of large crystalline domains and may result in a three-dimensional charge-transporting network. The optoelectronic properties of SF-4PDI2 have been systematically investigated. Using the commercially available PTB7-Th as the electron donor, a best PCE of 7.69% was achieved for the SF-4PDI2 based organic solar cells (OSCs), which is higher than that of the corresponding PDI tetramer-based ones. These results demonstrate that PDI2 is a promising alternative building block and shows magnificent potential in the photovoltaics field.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their advantages of light weight, low cost, easy processing and flexibility.1–4 In the past decade, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have emerged as alternatives to the conventional fullerene acceptors and gradually become the mainstream in the photovoltaics field.5–11 Thanks to the continuous efforts in materials design and device engineering, remarkable high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for non-fullerene based devices have been achieved.12–19 Perylene diimide (PDI) is one of the most commonly studied building blocks of NFAs because of its outstanding characteristics such as low cost, good stability, strong absorption in the visible region and ease of chemical functionalization.20–24 Due to the large π-conjugated plane, the pristine PDI usually displays strong π–π intermolecular interactions, which results in a strong tendency of molecular aggregation. The strong intermolecular electronic coupling of the planar PDI can facilitate charge transport.25 On the other hand, excessive aggregation will lead to the formation of micrometer scale crystalline domains. The oversized PDI phase domain will result in an inefficient exciton diffusion/separation, and consequently poor performances. Therefore, restricting the crystallinity of PDI appropriately without sacrificing the efficient charge transfer and mobility is the key design principle for PDI based NFAs.26,27 There are two main molecular design concepts to bear in mind regarding this trade-off. One is linking two or three PDI units directly together at the imide, ortho or bay position, and the other one is coupling several PDI units to a congested core at the ortho or bay position.28–38 The resultant molecules will possess twisted geometries due to the steric hindrance. Benefitting from the variety of the congested cores, an astonishing number of PDI based NFAs have been developed. Among these NFAs, the PDI tetramer as well as the dimer based on 9,9′-spirobifluorene (SF) have attracted special research interest from different groups, which may be ascribed to the intramolecular orthorhombic structure and multidirectional reaction sites of SF.39–53 The orthorhombic configuration of SF can prevent the formation of oversized domains. However, the large extent of the intramolecular twisting of SF based acceptors might lead to poor electron transport ability. This partially explains why most of the devices based on SF-core PDI tetramers and dimers show unsatisfactory performance with PCE lower than 6%. Yan and co-workers illustrate that reducing intramolecular twisting of 3D molecular acceptors appropriately could improve their photovoltaic performance.54 To take a different tact, keeping the SF core, we hypothesized that replacing the four PDI panels with π-extended derivatives could also improve the performance in OSCs. In light of this, the helical PDI oligomer (PDI2), which can be easily accessed and shows bright potential in organic optoelectronic devices, comes into our mind.55–69 In the effort described below, a PDI2 tetramer based non-fullerene small molecule acceptor (SMA), namely SF-4PDI2 (Scheme 1), was designed and synthesized. The optoelectronic properties of SF-4PDI2 were well studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence spectrometry, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The OSC devices based on SF-4PDI2 and commercially available PTB7-Th (Fig. S1, ESI†) blends were fabricated and characterized. A best PCE of 7.69% was achieved, which verifies the validity of our hypothesis.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The novel synthetic strategy of PDI oligomers (PDI2), developed by Nuckolls and Wang independently,55–59 facilitates the scalable gram-scale synthesis of SF-4PDI2. The SF-4PDI2 was obtained by one step Suzuki coupling reaction between spirobifluorene tetra-boronic acid tris(pinacol) ester (SF-4Bpin) and monobrominated PDI2 (PDI2-Br) in a yield of 36% (Scheme 1 and Scheme S1, ESI†). The target molecule exhibits excellent solubility in common organic solvent, such as dichloromethane, THF and toluene. 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectra (see in the ESI†) were well characterized to confirm the chemical structure. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of 385.2 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere, demonstrating that SF-4PDI2 possesses great thermal stability (Fig. S2, ESI†).
DFT calculations
To get insight into the optimal geometric configuration and molecular frontier orbitals of SF-4PDI2, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. To simplify the calculations, the alkyl chains were replaced by hydrogen atoms. The optimized geometry of SF-4PDI2 is presented in Fig. 1 and Fig. S3 (ESI†). The dihedral angles between the SF-core and inner PDI segments of PDI2 were 42.4°, 47.2°, 42.4° and 70.2°, respectively (Fig. S3a and b, ESI†). The two fluorene panels of the SF-core were approximately orthogonally arranged (∼86.8°) (Fig. S3d, ESI†). The helical structure of PDI2 is well persevered in SF-4PDI2 and the dihedral angles in the PDI2 moiety were 23.6°, 24.7°, 24.6° and 23.8° (Fig. S3c, ESI†), respectively. These results illustrate that SF-4PDI2 possesses a highly twisted configuration, which can efficiently suppress excessive aggregation. Thus, in terms of the geometric configuration, SF-4PDI2 could be a promising NFA. The electron density in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of SF-4PDI2 is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The HOMO level was mainly located on the SF core and the inner PDI moieties with a little contribution from the peripheral PDI moieties. The LUMO energy level distributed on one of the PDI2 panels and the inner and peripheral PDI moieties contributed equally. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels as well as the energy gap (Ecalgap) are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The Ecal(HOMO) and Ecal(LUMO) values of SF-4PDI2 were −6.03 and −3.82 eV, respectively, which were in agreement with the experiment results (vide infra).

Optoelectronic properties
The optoelectronic properties of SF-4PDI2 were studied by UV-vis absorption spectra and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The UV-vis absorption spectra of PTB7-Th film and SF-4PDI2 neat films as well as the donor–acceptor blend films are presented in Fig. 2. SF-4PDI2 displays a broad absorption band range from 350 to 650 nm in the film state with maxima of 395 nm and 539 nm, which complement well with the absorption bands of commonly used electron donor PTB7-Th to ensure full harvesting of light in the 350–800 nm range. The absorption band around 395 nm can be assigned to the characteristic absorption of the PDI2 moiety.55–69 In comparison with that in the solution of chloroform, the absorption spectrum in the film state exhibits a slight red-shift in peak maxima and a broadening of the profile (Fig. S5a, ESI†). This result illustrates a weak self-aggregation of SF-4PDI2 in the thin film. The molar extinction coefficient (ε) of SF-4PDI2 was calculated to be 2.3 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for the long wavelength absorption maximum at 538 nm, while it was 4.6 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for the maximum at 392 nm, according to the absorption spectrum in the solution of chloroform. The optical band gap was established to be 1.99 eV based on the onset of absorption, which coincided well with the DFT calculations.

The CV pattern of SF-4PDI2 (Fig. S6, ESI†) was characterized in dichloromethane solution. The HOMO level of SF-4PDI2 was calculated to be −5.93 eV from its oxidation onset, while the LUMO level was estimated to be −3.80 eV from the reduction one (Table 1). Thus the band gap was 2.03 eV according to the CV data, which is well matched with the result of optical measurements. As shown in Fig. 2b, the energy levels of SF-4PDI2 were well aligned with those of PTB7-Th, in conjunction with their complementary absorption spectra, indicating that PTB7-Th is a suitable donor material for SF-4PDI2 to construct OSC devices.

OSC device performance
In order to evaluate the photovoltaic potential of SF-4PDI2, the inverted device configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag was fabricated (Fig. 2c), using blended films of PTB7-Th:SF-4PDI2 as photoactive layers. The device performance was measured under simulated solar illumination of Am 1.5 G at 100 mW cm−2 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The photoactive layer was spin-coated from a o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) solution and the optimal conditions for preparing the devices were obtained by scanning the weight ratio of donor/acceptor (D/A), thermal annealing temperatures and annealing time. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2 and Tables S2–S4 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3a, the devices prepared from the identical condition of a D/A ratio of 1:1.2, annealing 60 °C for 10 minutes showed the best photovoltaic performance with a best PCE of 7.69%. The as-cast devices without annealing also exhibited considerable PCE of 7.35%, along with a Voc of 0.826 V, Jsc of 15.79 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 55.7%. This characteristic highly fulfilled the requirement of practical applications that the fabrication procedure should be as simple as possible. The photovoltaic performances of previous reported SF-core PDI tetramers as well as dimers with various electron donors including PTB7-Th are summarized in Table S5 (ESI†). It is worth noting that most of these PDI tetramer based OSCs displayed much lower PCEs (<6%) than that of the SF-4PDI2 based one, which can be mainly ascribed to the relatively lower Jsc. This result illustrated that replacing the PDI panels in the SF-core tetramer with the π-extended helical PDI2 can improve the Jsc value, and consequently, give better photovoltaic performance.

To further probe the accuracy of the high Jsc value obtained from J–V measurement, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for the optimal devices were characterized. As shown in Fig. 3b, the PTB7-Th:SF-4PDI2 blend based OSCs exhibit a broad photoelectron response ranging from 300 nm to 800 nm, which well coincided with the absorption profile of the donor and acceptor blend films. The highest EQE values of 74.8% and 78.8% at 690 nm were obtained for the as-cast and annealed PTB7-Th:SF-4PDI2 blend based devices, respectively. This result illustrated that SF-4PDI2 based devices possessed excellent light-harvesting properties and sufficient charge collection abilities during the optical-electron conversion process. The calculated short-circuit current density (Jcalsc) integrated from the EQE spectra was 15.34 mA cm−2 for the as-cast and 16.06 mA cm−2 for the annealed device. These data are consistent well with Jsc values obtained from J–V measurement within 3% mismatch (Fig. S7, ESI†).
To investigate the exciton dissociation efficiency of blend films, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of SF-4PDI2 and PTB7-Th neat films as well as the blend films were measured (Fig. S8, ESI†). The PL quenching efficiencies of the as-cast PTB7-Th:SF-4PDI2 films were 89.91% and 92.11% compared to PTB7-Th and SF-4PDI2 neat films, respectively (Table S6, ESI†), while the annealed blends showed very similar quenching efficiencies. The significant PL quenching illustrated an efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer. The light intensity dependence of Jsc was conducted to gain insight into the exciton recombination dynamics of the devices (Fig. S9, ESI†). The Jsc is fit to a power-law relation Jsc ∝ Pαlight, where Plight is the light intensity and the exponent α is related to charge transfer in the system.64 If the value of the exponent is approaching 1, it implies a weak bimolecular recombination and efficient carrier collection. The α values for the as-cast and annealed PTB7-Th:SF-4PDI2 blend based devices were 0.95 and 0.96, respectively, which indicated a weaker bimolecular recombination and more efficient free carrier collection for the annealed devices. Moreover, the relationship between Voc and light intensity can be described as Voc ∝ nkT/qln(Plight), which was employed to evaluate the degree of trap-assisted recombination. In principle, if the value of n equals to 1 (the slope equal to kT/q), it indicates that the device only has bimolecular recombination, while a slope equal to 2kT/q implies that trap-assisted recombination dominates in OSCs.70 As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the slopes of the as-cast and the annealed devices were 1.08kT/q and 1.01kT/q, respectively, which demonstrated that the PTB7-Th:SF-4PDI2-based OSCs exhibited a negligible trap-assisted recombination.
The space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method was applied to explore the hole and electron mobilities of PTB7-Th:SF-4PDI2 blend based devices. The hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated with configurations of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:SF-4PDI2/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:SF-4PDI2/LiF/Al, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 3, the as-cast device based on PTB7-Th:SF-4PDI2 showed a hole mobility of 1.96 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 1.44 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the annealed blend films (60 °C for 10 min) exhibited increased hole and electron mobilities of 2.13 × 10−3 and 4.64 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Owing to the higher hole and electron mobilities, SF-4PDI2 based devices showed a better photovoltaic performance than that of the SF-core PDI analogue. These results were well matched with the data discussed above and verified the validity of our hypothesis that π-extension improves the photovoltaic performance on the premise of preventing the formation of oversized domains.

The surface morphologies of the as-cast and the annealed PTB7-Th:SF-4PDI2 blend films, which is vital to the OSC performance, were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), smooth surface morphologies were observed for the as-cast and annealed blend films, with small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 0.651 and 0.654 nm, respectively. The RMS value illustrates a small phase domain size and good miscibility of the polymer donor and the small molecular acceptor, which can suppress exciton recombination efficiently and is beneficial for exciton diffusion.
Conclusions
To probe the validity of the hypothesis that π-extension improves the photovoltaic performance on the premise of preventing the formation of oversized domains, in this contribution, a novel SF-based PDI oligomer tetramer SF-4PDI2 was designed, synthesized and well characterized. The photovoltaic performance of this tetramer was also investigated using the commercially available PTB7-Th as the electron donor. In comparison with the reported SF-core PDI tetramers, most of whose PCEs were lower than 6%, SF-4PDI2 showed a considerable high PCE of 7.69%. This was benefited from the π-extension of the helical π-conjugated PDI2 panels, which can lead to high charge transport abilities. Moreover, the helical configuration of PDI2, along with the orthogonal configuration of SF, endows SF-4PDI2 with good compatibility and miscibility with PTB7-Th, and then favorable morphology, and consequently, good photovoltaic performance. This study will pave the way for reasonable design of new highly efficient PDI and helical PDI oligomer based acceptors for OSCs.
Experimental section
Synthesis of SF-4PDI2
A 100 mL flask was charged with Pd(PPh3)4 (100 mg, 0.086 mmol), K3PO4 (400 mg, 1.88 mmol), PDI2-Br (1.5 g, 0.93 mmol, 5.2 equiv.) and SF-Bpin (145 mg, 0.177 mmol, 1 equiv.). The charged flask was evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen for 30 minutes. Oxygen-free THF/H2O (v/v = 4:1, 50 mL) was introduced to the flask as a solvent via a syringe. Then the mixture was heated to 80 °C for 60 h. The solution was then cooled to room temperature and diluted with water and dichloromethane. The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure. And the crude solid was purified by silica gel chromatography eluted with petroleum ether/CH2Cl2 from 2:1 to 1:3, and further recrystallization with DCM/MeOH afforded the target molecule SF-4PDI2 as a dark red laminar solid (410 mg, 36%).

Organic solar cell fabrication
The inverted devices were fabricated with the structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The pre-patterned (sheet resistance, 15 Ω sq−1) ITO-glass substrates were sequentially cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with detergent (Alconox Inc.), de-ionized water, acetone and isopropanol. The oven-dried substrates were then treated by oxygen plasma (180 W) for 5 min. The ZnO precursor solution (110 mg mL−1) was prepared by dissolving 0.22 g ZnAc2·2H2O in 2 mL 2-methoxyethanol and 0.056 mL ethanol amine and then stirred for at least 24 h before use. The ZnO precursor solution was spin-cast onto the ITO substrate with a spinning rate of 5000 rpm for 60 s and the thickness was ∼32 nm. The as-cast film was then annealed in ambient circumstances upon 150 °C for 60 min to form a compact ZnO layer. The blend solutions of PTB7-Th:SF-4PDI2 (D/A ratio, 1:1.2, weight ratio) mixtures were processed with o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) with an identical concentration of 20 mg mL−1. All these solutions were heated at 60 °C and stirred overnight (or 100 °C for 3 h) to obtain well-mixed blend solutions. The active layer thicknesses of these three devices were carefully optimized through spinning rate 3500 rpm. And, the spinning duration was fixed at 50 s. The active layers were thermally annealed at 60 °C in a glove box for 10 min to get rid of residual solvent. A MoO3 (8 nm) layer and an Ag layer (100 nm) electrode were sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation using a shadow mask under a vacuum of <1.0 × 10−4 pa. The effective device area, defined by the overlap region of ITO and Ag electrodes, was 0.0625 cm2.
The J–V measurements were conducted under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 using an AAA solar simulator (SP94023A-SR1, NEWPORT). The illumination intensity was calculated with a standard photovoltaic cell (91150V) which was incorporated with a quartz window (1000P072). External quantum efficiency (EQE) was determined by an EQE system (Zolix, China). The film thicknesses were determined on a Bruker DektakXT Stylus Profling System.
