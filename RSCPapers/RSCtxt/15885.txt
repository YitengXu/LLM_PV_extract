1. Introduction
Optoelectronics that are used for light emitting, modulating, transmitting or sensing have a fast-expanding market and a diverse range of novel applications including displays,1–3 photovoltaics,4,5 and photodetectors.6–8 Techniques of micro/nanostructure fabrication from optoelectronic materials in a high-resolution, large-scale, and low-cost fashion are critically important, especially for size reduction, which contributes to the improved performance and increased integration density. Optical lithographic techniques, which are capable of fabricating features with sizes below 100 nm, are dominating the semiconductor industry right now and this trend will continue for a long time. Nevertheless, developments in optoelectronics provide immense incentives to expand the diversity of materials, substrates and structures, e.g., optically and thermally sensitive organic materials for sensing or detection, flexible and stretchable substrates for wearable electronics, and curved or three-dimensional electronics for higher integration. Such developments in optoelectronics lead to the inapplicability of conventional lithographic techniques and require alternative micro-/nanoscale manufacturing techniques that offer complementary capabilities.
With the priority of low-temperature and cost-effectiveness, inkjet printing9 that directly deposits functional materials onto desired substrates has been widely used in fabricating optical, electrical, and biological devices. However, the relatively coarse resolution (typically larger than 20 μm, mainly determined by the nozzle size) of the printed patterns has restricted its further development. Reducing the nozzle size leads to smaller droplets, but it requires a higher actuation effort that is impractical for many viscous inks and prone to cause nozzle blockage.
Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) jetting, which uses a high electric field force to pull the fluids rather than push them to form small droplets, offers an attractive solution to micro/nano manufacturing.10,11 The voltage applied between the nozzle and the substrate leads to the accumulation of mobile ions near the pendent meniscus liquid–air surface, thereby deforming the meniscus into a conical shape known as a Taylor cone. When the electrostatic stresses overcome the surface tension, a very thin jet or small droplets will be emitted from the Taylor cone with a resolution even smaller than one thousandth of the nozzle orifice, presenting unique advantages of high resolution12 (<1 μm) and compatibility with a wide viscosity range of inks13–15 (1–10000 cps), making it the focal point of current research in printed electronics. By tuning ink properties and process conditions, EHD jetting is capable of creating thin film layers by electrospraying,16,17 micro/nanofibres by electrospinning18–20 and micro/nanodroplets by EHD jet printing,21,22 as shown in Fig. 1. This jetting mode tunability presents advantages for optoelectronic device fabrication, considering that solar cells need micro/nanoscale homogeneous thin films, displays need high resolution and uniform structures, and sensors and detectors need more complex patterns with a high specific surface area, and all these requirements can be fulfilled by the same EHD deposition equipment. A combination of different EHD jetting modes to realize the deposition of dots, fibers or films, and integrating them into optoelectronics fabrication has recently been reported,23–25 demonstrating the capability of EHD jetting for producing multilayer devices. Within these specific advantages of resolution, ink compatibility and jetting mode tunability, various fascinating optoelectronic materials (e.g., perovskites, quantum dots, TiO2, ZnO and P3HT) have been explored for deposition by EHD jetting into micro/nanoscale dots/fibers/films to form solar cells, photodetectors and displays (Fig. 1), and EHD deposition has become feasible in commercial applications other than just in the lab for micro/nano patterning and optoelectronics manufacturing. Previous reviews have covered the potential applications of EHD deposition in bioelectronics,26,27 flexible electronics,28,29 additive manufacturing,30etc., but most of them mainly focus on one deposition mode or one kind of optoelectronics. This paper aims to provide a better understanding of and comprehensive insights into the multi-mode tunability of EHD deposition and its applications in various optoelectronic material depositions and device fabrication.

This review highlights recent advancements of EHD deposition techniques and their applications in optoelectronics manufacturing. In section 2, the mechanism of cone-jet formation, the transition between different jetting modes, and the development of each jetting mode are discussed. Meanwhile, the influences of ink characters and process parameters are discussed, and various types of nozzles are introduced to provide insights into the control of the EHD deposition process. Section 3 summarizes a few state-of-the-art applications of EHD deposition technologies in optoelectronics manufacturing, including solar cells, photodetectors, lighting/display and transparent electrodes. Section 4 concludes the paper and proposes an outlook on future perspectives. As EHD deposition techniques can overcome the challenges existing in traditional fabrication processes, they will possess new functionalities and boost the cost-effectiveness and performance of the existing ones.
2. Principles of EHD deposition technologies
2.1 Three basic modes of EHD jetting
Different from conventional inkjet printing which “pushes” ink out of the nozzle through a resistive heater or a piezoelectric transducer, EHD jetting is a “pull” process as an extra electric field is employed between a nozzle and a grounded substrate. The electric field leads to the accumulation of mobile ions in the ink in regions near the surface of the pendent meniscus. Coulombic repulsion between these ions deforms the meniscus into a conical shape known as a Taylor cone. At sufficiently high electric fields, droplets eject from the cone as the electrostatic stresses overcome the surface tension. The electrohydrodynamic behavior for jet/droplet formation is complex, as shown in Fig. 2a,31 and is affected by ink properties, such as viscosity, surface tension, electrical conductivity, dipole moment, and process-related factors including applied voltage, offset height, pressure, and flow rate. By changing the above parameters, a number of ejection behaviors can be observed, like dripping, micro-dripping, cone-jets, and multi-jets,32 as shown in Fig. 2b and c.33 Among them, the cone-jet, where a single micro/nano thin jet is emitted from the Taylor cone, attracts the most attention as it provides the required controllability for precise manufacturing, and it is capable of producing micro/nano dots, lines and films by tuning the jet stability into three modes (electrospray, electrospinning, and EHD jet printing), as shown in Fig. 2d–f.

(i) Diagram of the whipping and varicose instability, where δμ ∝ 1/μ, Γ ∝ E2.38 Copyright 2019, American Physical Society. 
The jet issuing from a Taylor cone may experience a wide range of competing instabilities, including surface-tension-driven axis-symmetric varicose instability, and electrically driven non-axisymmetric whipping/bending instability (Fig. 2g).34 For electrospraying, varicose instability dominates the process and manifests varicose waves on the surface of an EHD jet. When the surface charge density reaches the Rayleigh limit,35 the jet breaks up to form highly charged fine particles/beads, dispersed in a radial fashion due to Coulomb repulsion. For electrospinning, the whipping instability36 can be explained as follows: if a small portion of the jet moves slightly off its axis, the charge redistributes along the surface and the electrical forces will promote the growth of non-axisymmetry. This effect enhances the solvent evaporation rate, and thus favors fiber formation. For EHD jet printing, all these jet instabilities are inhibited for the micro/nano manufacturing of high-precision features and structures. Whether the electrified jet breaks up or becomes chaotic depends on the competition of the interfacial forces, e.g., surface tension, viscosity force, normal coulombic force, and tangential electric stress. Hohman et al. analyzed the stability of an electrified jet and drew an operating diagram of an aqueous polymer, shown in Fig. 2h.37 The lower stability boundary demarcates the varicose instability and the steady jet, and the upper one demarcates the steady jet and the whipping instability. The linear stability analysis showed that both viscosity and surface charge are important to capture the long-wavelength and whipping features of the instability. Xia et al. further studied the jetting instability through a substantial number of experiments and achieved an operating diagram of instability modes in terms of Γ = ε0E2R/ε0γ and δμ = (γ2ρε0/μ3K)1/3, where E, R, ε0, γ, ρ, K are the electric field intensity, character radius, permittivity of ambient air, surface tension, density, and conductivity, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2i.38 A detailed review of charged jet stability can be found in ref. 16. These three modes of EHD jetting can be achieved with the same setup by tuning the ink properties and process conditions, and are promising for various micro/nano-structure depositions.
In the following part, we will give a brief introduction of the development of each jetting mode. Electrospraying is a relatively mature research field. It utilizes an electrical force to develop a pointed meniscus and a liquid micro-jet, whose breakup produces charged droplets to fabricate large area thin films in nanoscale thickness, as shown in Fig. 2d.39,40 In 1882, Lord Rayleigh developed a famous theoretical model, named the Rayleigh Limit, to explain the breakup of a charged droplet.35 His result implies that the stability criterion is equivalent to the condition that the electric stress outward is equal to the surface tension stress inward. Zeleny41 first reported and photographed electrospray phenomena in 1917, and then Taylor analyzed the electro-hydro-static equilibrium of the conical meniscus, and finally established the Taylor cone theory.42 After that, using cone-jet electrospraying to generate highly uniform charged droplets in the nanometer range started to attract a lot of attention. For example, Prof. John B. Fenn pioneered the electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS)43 that eventually brought him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2002, the LISA Pathfinder project applied electrospraying in a micro-propulsion system for space-based gravitational wave observatories,44 and many researchers started to use electrosprays to prepare functional films with nano-thickness.17 In electrospraying, the uniformity of the droplet size is important as it enables the creation of homogeneous, ordered, or periodic structures. Generally, deposition under a stable cone-jet has the useful characteristic of droplet size monodispersity, and a comprehensive review can be found in ref. 16 and 45.
Electrospinning is a straightforward, cost-effective and high-efficient method to fabricate fibers with diameters ranging from several micrometers to tens of nanometers, which overlaps with contemporary textile fiber technology. The evolution of electrospinning can be broadly divided into three stages: (1) traditional electrospinning for the fabrication of nonwoven mats, where the charged jet experiences a short stable straight segment near the tip of the nozzle, and then suffers a catastrophic bending instability46,47 caused by charge repulsion. (2) Field-induced electrospinning for the assembly of aligned fibers, where dynamic rotating collector-like wheels48 are employed to drag the polymer jet out of the spinner, or an electrostatic lens is used,49 and a pair of parallel conducting electrodes50 are introduced to control the electrical field distribution. (3) Digital electrospinning for direct-writing patterns, which includes near-field electrospinning (NFES),51 that restricts the nozzle-to-collector distance within the straight segment, and mechano-electrospinning (MES)52 or helix electrohydrodynamic printing (HE-printing),53 which introduce a drag force to extend that distance to the first whipping segment. These improvements realize the direct writing of patterned fibers with diameters ranging from tens of nanometers to several micrometers (Fig. 2e47,54,55), which could fulfill the requirements in the development of printed fiber-based electronics.
EHD jet printing is capable of producing droplets at least one order of magnitude smaller than the nozzle size, such as complex patterns with a high-resolution as small as 1 μm.10 Traditional EHD jet printing uses a constant voltage between the nozzle and substrate, in which the pulsating frequency and the droplet size cannot be varied independently as they are both coupled to the applied voltage. As a solution to this limitation, a pulse voltage has been adopted to drive the printing process, where the voltage pulse peak induces a jetting mode for a short duration and the voltage pulse baseline is picked to ensure that the meniscus is always deformed to nearly a conical shape that is prepared for the pulsation. This approach enables precision and high-resolution drop-on-demand printing, thus greatly broadening the application of EHD jet printing in 2D/3D nanostructure fabrication, as shown in Fig. 2f.12,56,57 Further research investigated the controllability of the printing volume and frequency. Qian et al.58 analyzed the relationship between the droplet volume and the process parameters, and found that the droplet volume highly depended on the flow rate, nozzle size and printing frequency. Stachewicz59 demonstrated that the hydrodynamic phenomena inside the capillary put an upper limit on the ejection frequency, above which droplet ejection could not occur effectively. Choi et al.60 developed a scaling law for determining the pulsation frequency. Yang et al.61 proposed an optimized voltage waveform to reduce the meniscus oscillation amplitude, which may be helpful to increase the maximum frequency for consistent jetting. These results provide valuable guidance for high-speed printing, and the EHD jetting frequency has reached above 10 kHz.
Based on the three basic jetting modes, some new types of EHD deposition technique, like coaxial,62 parallel,63 and mixed64 jetting, have recently been employed to fabricate special micro/nanostructures. Coaxial jetting uses two concentrically located needles as the nozzle, and two or more different inks as the inner and outer layer, to form a coaxial jet with one ink coated by another. Through this process, capsules65 and coaxial fibers or nanotubes66 can be easily fabricated, as shown in Fig. 3a left, which broadens the application of EHD deposition in micro-encapsulation and optical waveguides. Parallel jetting uses a nozzle with a side-by-side geometry, and a bipolar jet can be maintained63 as shown in Fig. 3a middle, to form micro/nanospheres or fibers with multicomponents. Mixed printing enables a quick switch and mixing of different inks into a continuous structure,64 as shown in Fig. 3a right, which provides a method for fabricating chemically architected materials and devices. These newly developed EHD deposition methods expand EHD jetting from a single, homogeneous material deposition technique to a multi-material, programmable structure construction technique.

2.2 Ink engineering and process optimization
Unlike traditional inkjet printing, which imposes quite stringent requirements on the fluidic properties of the inks (e.g., low-viscosity inks, <20 cps), EHD deposition has good compatibility with a wide viscosity range of ink (1–10000 cps), and a broad range of functional materials have been successfully used in EHD deposition. Solutions, suspensions, and molten materials are good examples, where functional materials can be dissolved or suspended in solvents, or simply melted with heat to prepare liquid-phase inks that can flow out of the nozzle. These functional materials include nanoparticles (e.g., Au, Ag, Cu nanoparticles, quantum dots), polymer inks (e.g., PEO, PVP, PVDF, PEDOT:PSS) that mix the polymers with solvents (e.g., water, ethanol, glycerol, acetone), biomaterials and bioagents (e.g., protein, DNA, cells), molten polymers and metal alloys, and one-dimensional (1D)/two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials. To achieve the required ink properties, additives (such as surfactant and humectant) are often added to the ink to adjust its fluidic properties (e.g., surface tension, viscosity, and density) and electric properties (e.g., conductivity and dipole moment).
The proper selection of the material properties is essential for successful EHD jetting. Generally, the EHD jetting process can be divided into three stages: the liquid cone formation, the cone-jet transition, and the development of jet stability. The first two stages are the competition between the electrostatic forces and the surface tension. Therefore, for materials with a large surface tension, it is difficult to form a stable cone-jet.67 At this time, adding surfactant into the ink to decrease the surface tension is a commonly used method.68,69 The conductivity of the liquid is another important factor. In a typical EHD deposition system, the charge relaxation time te (, where ε0, εr, and k mean the vacuum permittivity, fluid relative permittivity, and electrical conductivity, respectively) should be smaller than the hydrodynamic time th (the characteristic time of the fluid supply).33 For liquids with high conductivities, the te is short and sufficient charge can accumulate on the surface to counteract the surface tension force. Oppositely, insulating liquids with low conductivity are difficult to deform into a conical shape, as there is insufficient time to develop an appreciable surface charge, but a jet can also be ejected for liquids with low conductivities (e.g., 10−13 S m−1) by using some special methods to accelerate charge accumulation, like inserting a tip electrode into the tube, applying high voltage pulses, and exerting external tractions. The relative permittivity of liquid that is determined by the alignment of dipoles also influences the electrical relaxation time te. For liquids with a higher relative permittivity, a larger potential is required to achieve cone-jet formation as it has a larger charge relaxation time.33 Viscosity or viscoelasticity plays an important role in stabilizing the jet.70 This effect is prominent with polymer jets, where the viscoelastic effects and elongational viscosity prevent the capillary instability, reduce the ionic mobility, and generally lead to a longer/thicker jet, and a lower printing frequency.
In addition to ink properties, processing conditions also affect the deposition quality. The harmony of ink and process conditions is of importance in producing the desired jetting mode, as shown in Table 1. The dimensionless voltage and distance are , where R is the nozzle radius, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, and γ is the surface tension of the ink. Generally, electrospraying prefers ink with high conductivity, low surface tension and low viscosity that corresponds to easier electrostatic atomization, and a high voltage and large nozzle-to-collector distance are always preferred. Electrospinning requires high-viscosity polymer-based ink, a high voltage and a large nozzle-to-collector distance that benefit jet elongation and whipping. EHD jet printing prefers ink with medium conductivity, surface tension, and viscosity and a relatively low voltage and nozzle-to-collector distance that prevent the jet from developing any instabilities. Although the EHD phenomenon has been known for over 200 years, the actual process is not completely understood, and it is not always possible to know beforehand the mode obtained when the values of the main parameters are given, considering the complexity of EHD phenomena controlled by multi-parameters. Recently, dimensional analysis has been used to give a qualitative description of the operating diagram, jet diameter and emitted current. For example, Lee et al.33 organized six dimensionless parameters to draw the jetting maps for ethanol/terpineol mixtures, which provides an effective way of obtaining the operating diagram of the cone-jet mode and evaluating the jet stability. A comprehensive review of the dimensional analysis of EHD jetting can be found in ref. 71.

2.3 EHD deposition nozzles
The nozzle is the most important part of the EHD deposition equipment, and directly influences the EHD deposition efficiency and accuracy. Stainless steel nozzles (inner diameter: 60–500 μm) and pulled glass pipettes (tip diameter: 0.3–50 μm) are the most widely used in EHD jetting systems, especially the latter, which can achieve a printing feature size smaller than 100 nm. Besides the above hollow nozzles, some special nozzles, such as coaxial nozzles72 and parallel nozzles,73 were designed to fabricate structures with double/triple layers. Meanwhile, piezoelectric hybrid driving nozzles74,75 and airflow assisted nozzles76 were designed to improve the printing frequency or accuracy.
To solve the efficiency bottleneck in EHD deposition, high-density and individual controllable nozzle arrays are desperately needed. Different kinds of nonaddressable/addressable nozzle arrays are shown in Fig. 3b and c. Assembling a plurality of stainless-steel nozzles or glass capillaries into a nozzle array is a simple and effective method,77 but these coarse nozzle arrays with mm-level spacing cannot meet the requirements for high density and accuracy. Using MEMS-based techniques to prepare high-precision glass or silicon nozzle arrays has gradually become a focus, and various high-precision cylindrical78–80 and pyramid-shaped nozzle arrays81 have been fabricated. Besides MEMS-based technology, special processing techniques like laser etching,82 micro-machining83 and high-precision 3D printing84,85 also show tremendous potential in EHD nozzle array fabrication. Besides increasing the nozzle array density, individual control to realize the drop-on-demand printing of complex patterns is critical. Nozzles equipped with an individual ink supply or driving voltage source86 can realize addressable jetting, but this method is not suitable for large-scale nozzle arrays. Placing an electrode ring underneath each nozzle87 and regulating the potential between the nozzle and ring via a switch array is a more promising way to realize addressable jetting. However, no large-scale and addressable nozzle array has been reported since its principle verification, which may be caused by the high-voltage crosstalk and breakdown, demanding precision in fabrication and assembly. In a word, these nozzle arrays are still in a primary R & D stage, especially for high precision drop-on-demand applications, and there is still a long way to go to eliminate high-voltage crosstalk, realize independent jetting control, and ensure printing uniformity and stability.
3. Applications via EHD deposition
3.1 Solar cells via electrospray
Solar cells that directly convert the clean, renewable and abundant solar energy into electricity play an important role in the 21st century for the limited fossil fuel resources and serious pollution. Recently, solution-processible solar cells, which mainly include polymer solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and perovskite solar cells, have emerged as one of the best candidates for low-cost renewable energy technologies compared with silicon-based solar cells. To make solution-processible solar cells commercially viable, several coating techniques, such as shearing plate coating, slot-die coating, screen printing, inkjet printing and spray coating, have been investigated. Among them, the electrospray deposition method has recently been considered as a promising coating process for organic thin film devices.17,88 It utilizes a high electrostatic force to generate micro/nanoscale charged droplets, which is conducive to the formation of thinner, more homogeneous films and improves the alignment/orientation of the polymer molecules. This section reviews the efforts and progress in electrospraying in the fabrication of polymer solar cells, DSSCs, and perovskite solar cells. Table 2 summarizes the materials, process parameters and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of deposited solar cells.

Most studies on electrosprayed polymer solar cells are based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), which is a classic and well-studied P-type conjugated polymer. To achieve stable electrospray deposition, uniform film morphology and high-performance solar cells, various attempts based on mixed solvent methods, optimized process parameters and post-treatment have been performed.17 For example, Zhao et al.89 pointed out the importance of electrical conductivity. Polar solvents are favoured organic solvents in electrospray processes; for non-polar solvents with low conductivity, Zhao et al. achieved a stable cone-jet by adding acetic acid into the solution to increase the conductivity, which benefits the balance between the surface tension and the electric stress. Moreover, compared with acetone and acetonitrile, the active layer formed by a solvent containing high electrical conductivity acetic acid enhanced the vertical segregation distribution, improved the P3HT crystallinity, and produced better device performance (PCE 2.99 ± 0.08%). During electrospraying, the high electrostatic force is capable of changing the polymer chain stacking orientation90 (Fig. 4a), which drastically influences the charge carrier mobilities (for example, spin-coated thin films of P3HT exhibit a mobility of ≈10−5 cm2 (V s)−1 in the plane of the film, but ≈10−4 cm2 (V s)−1 in the direction perpendicular to the plane91). Kim et al.92 studied the influence of post-treatment on film morphology (Fig. 4b). The results indicate that solvent vapor soaking followed by thermal annealing treatment rewelded the original interfacial boundaries among the deposited pancakes, reduced the film roughness, and led to enhanced charge transport and improved PCE (3.25%). Zhao et al.93 derived the Damkhöler number (Da) equation to clarify the interplay of nine independent parameters involved in an electrospray process, and the combined effect on the morphology/crystallinity of the active layers, as well as the performance of the solar cells. Fukuda et al.94 studied the newer system of PTB7-Th:PC71BM blending by electrospraying. They found that both the crystallite size and PCE increased with the solvent evaporation time, and a highest PCE of 8.6% was achieved. Kimoto et al.95 used electrospraying to fabricate double-layered (P3HT and PC70BM) and triple-layered (P3HT, interlayer, and PC70BM) solar cell devices. To avoid degradation of the organic materials, a differential pumping system was adopted to reduce the applied voltage from 5 kV to 2 kV. They optimized mixed solutions with different polarities and boiling points to ensure that the deposited film was semi-wet, which facilitates the formation of a flat film during the drying process. These studies provide references for the ink preparation and process optimization of P3HT-based solar cells to achieve stable cone-jet electrospraying, uniform film morphology/crystallinity, and multi-layer deposition.

DSSCs have stimulated intensive interest recently due to their facile, low-cost and environmentally friendly features in both material preparation and device manufacturing. A typical DSSC device consists of four basic elements: photoanode, dye, electrolyte, and counter electrode. TiO2 in nanocrystalline mesoporous form is frequently used as a photoanode for DSSCs; it plays a key role in improving the cell performance, which requires a large specific surface area for dye adsorption, and an efficient electron transport path for electron collection. By introducing monoethanolamine (MEA) into the precursor solution,96 nanoparticle TiO2 electrodes with a controllable particle size, film transparency and adhesion were deposited using the electrospray method, and an overall light to electricity conversion efficiency of 2.91% was obtained. To improve the device efficiency, efforts like developing novel film nanostructures, incorporating a second semiconductor with a different band gap, and incorporating efficient charge transport materials have been attempted. For example, Hwang et al.97 prepared hierarchically structured mesoporous TiO2 spheres through electrospraying, and achieved a high PCE of over 10%, mainly because of the advantages conveyed by the sphere-shaped particulate electrodes, e.g., the large surface area, scattering effects, and large porosity (Fig. 4c). Zhu et al.98 studied the influence of dispersion solvents on TiO2 suspensions. They found that dispersion solvents with more OH groups resulted in a higher suspension stability and higher TiO2 concentration, which benefits the mass production of high-performance solar cells. Liu et al.99 prepared stacked graphene–TiO2 photoanodes by the electrospray method, and found that graphene films could improve the charge transfer and suppress the charge recombination at the interfaces of the TiO2/dye and TiO2/electrolyte (Fig. 4d). In addition, one-dimensional TiO2 nanofibers100,101 fabricated by electrospinning have also been widely investigated for DSSC applications, considering their large surface area and few grain boundaries.
In a very short time, perovskite solar cells (based on CH3NH3PbI3 or its analogues) have shown tremendous potential to be a future dominant photovoltaic technology in the market. They offer high efficiency (>25.2%102) owing to the ideal material properties (e.g., high ambipolar mobilities, efficient high light absorptions, and long charge-carrier diffusion lengths). To obtain high-quality perovskite films with scalable fabrication capabilities, the electrospray process has recently been investigated. Hong et al.103 developed a continuous electrospray coating system for the rapid and scalable fabrication of perovskite solar cells (Fig. 5a and b). By modulating the applied electrical potential to control the size of CH3NH3PbI3 precursor droplets, pinhole-free and large grain-sized perovskite solar cells with the best PCE of 13.27% were obtained. Heo et al.104 utilized vertically aligned TiO2 nanorod electrodes with straight macropores to form void-free dense films, thus enhancing the reproducibility of SCs fabricated by the electrospray-coating process. Han et al.105 presented a sheath-gas-assisted electrospray system (Fig. 5c) to enable stable high-flow electrospraying of perovskite precursor solutions into small charged droplets; they obtained high-quality perovskite film and a PCE of 14.2%. Jiang et al.106 used electrospraying to print three functional layers (ETL, perovskite, and HTL) for solar cells in ambient air, and achieved all electrospray-printed devices with a PCE up to 15.0%. They optimized the precursor ink formulation and electrospray parameters to ensure that the droplet flight time was shorter than the evaporation time. The deposited continuous wet precursor films lead to high-quality dry functional films (Fig. 5d). Oppositely, some researchers think that the de-wetting of the precursor film may cause inhomogeneous crystallization of the perovskite layer, especially in large area conditions. Lin et al.107 optimized the electrospray process to deposit solidified crystalline precursors on substrates, which were then converted to perovskites through a solid-state reaction under suitable annealing conditions. A hybrid cell fabricated by this way exhibits a PCE of 9.3%, comparable to conventional spin-coated devices, which is worthy of further investigation. Kavadiya et al.108 proposed a two-step process to form the perovskite layer. PbI2 film was first deposited by spin coating, and then solvent-free MAI nanoparticles were electrosprayed on the PbI2 layer (Fig. 5e). The perovskite solar cells fabricated at ambient humidity exhibit high efficiency (12%) and stability (4000 h), which may be caused by a controlled solvent-free reactivity that results in the formation of a smooth perovskite film.

In summary, electrospraying is a competitive technique in solar cell fabrication, as it can handle different solutions to form uniform or nanostructured films for various types of PV device. However, the fundamental physics behind solvent selection, heat and the mass transfer of tiny droplets impact dynamics on substrates, and space charge reduction remains to be studied, for example the composition and proportion of mixed solvents with proper conductivity, surface tension and boiling point to form a stable Taylor cone, the influence of droplet diameter and charge on film morphology, and the effect of kV level high voltage and high current on device performance.
3.2 Photodetectors via electrospinning
Photodetectors, which convert light signals into precise electrical signals, have remarkable applications in a wide range of fields, such as optical communications, biomedical imaging, environmental monitoring, space exploration, security, night-vision and motion detection. Currently, the photodetection market is dominated by products made from bulk crystalline-Si, Si/Ge heterojunctions or III–V semiconductor alloys, which require the use of thick materials to achieve sizeable responsivity and are difficult to use in flexible and transparent photodetection application scenarios. Electrospun nanofibers, characterized by high porosity, flexibility, a large specific surface area and a wide range of materials/spectral responses, are the ideal candidates for sensitive, fast-responding, and user-friendly photodetectors. Generally, the photoresponses of electrospun nanofibers to light irradiation with different wavelengths mainly depend on their band gap. Materials with large band gaps (e.g., ZnO, SnO2 and In2O3), moderate band gaps (e.g., CdS, Si and In2Se3), and narrow band gaps (e.g., In2Te3 and InAsSb) are chosen as the active materials for UV, visible and infrared photodetectors, respectively.
UV photodetectors are essential to a broad range of practical applications such as in flame detection, confidential space communications, and biological and environmental sensing. Among various 1D inorganic nanostructures, ZnO nanowires are the most extensively studied building blocks for UV photodetectors due to their distinctive properties such as a wide direct bandgap (3.4 eV), large exciton binding energy (60 meV), prominent biological inertness, and manufacturing flexibility. Recently, Liu et al.109 (Fig. 6a and b) presented an all-printable ZnO nanowire array UV photodetector on a polyimide substrate, with a tunable channel and density inherited from the NFES process, and a granular nanowire structure after calcination of an electrospun zinc acetate/PVP nanofiber array. The NFES process utilized mechanical force to align the nanofibers/channels in a straight line with a controllable density. Due to the rough and porous structure-induced large surface area of the electrospun-sintered fiber, and the grain-boundaries-induced unique band-edge modulation along the nanowire axial direction, the devices show high photoconductive gain, responsivity and detectivity up to 3.3 × 1017 Jones. SnO2, a typical n-type wide-bandgap semiconductor (3.6 eV), has also been widely explored for UV detection. For example, Li et al.110 demonstrated a UV photodetector based on an electrospun polycrystalline SnO2 nanotube film. The device showed a combination of a high photo/dark current ratio (850) and relatively fast time response characteristics (the rise and decay time at 1.0 V are 5 s and 15 s, respectively). Huang et al.111 engineered electrospun SnO2 nanofiber webs into a buckling open-mesh configuration, by which highly stretchable (≈160%) and transparent (>86% at 550 nm) UV photodetectors can be realized. Tian et al.112 fabricated a high-performance, fully transparent photodetector from electrospun ZnO–SnO2 heterojunction nanofibers, and this strategy can be extended to other heterostructural nanomaterials, such as TiO2–SnO2 and ZnO–TiO2. Similarly, TiO2 nanowires,113 GaN nanowires,114 bimetallic GaInO3 nanowires,115 SnO2–NiO heterojunctions,116etc., have been used to fabricate high-performance UV photodetectors based on an electrospinning process.

Visible light (typically 400–750 nm) photodetectors have wide applications in optical communication, surveillance, spectrum analysis, fluorescent biomedical imaging, etc., and a wide range of 1D inorganic semiconductor nanomaterials and their compounds have been applied to fabricate 1D-nanostructure-based visible light photodetectors.6 Li et al.117 reported a type of electrospun methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite (MAPbI3)/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) composite fiber (Fig. 6c), where the former material decides the absorption edge and the optical gap of the composite fiber, and the latter improves the moisture stability and thermal stability of the perovskite materials. The photoresponse of the detector was highly sensitive to broadband visible light, and reached 6.5 μA W−1 at 700 nm with a voltage bias of 10 V. Compared with pure MAPbI3 photodetectors, this composite fiber photodetector has improved stability and flexibility, which can be used to detect motion-related angular changes. Zheng et al.118 reported a flexible and transparent photodetector with a broad response range and improved optoelectronic properties based on co-electrospinning of TiO2 nanotubes/MAPbI3 QDs. The process adopted PVP/Ti(OiPr)4 ink as the shell solution and heavy mineral oil as the core solution, which means that nanotubes (NTs) would be deposited instead of NWs. The photodetectors showed an improvement in responsivity by three orders of magnitude in the visible range and maintained good performance in the UV region compared with TiO2 NT photodetectors (Fig. 6d). Moreover, their photoelectric properties were stable even when exposed to wet air for 72 h or heated at 100 °C. In order to broaden the spectral response range of ZnO from UV to visible light, Zheng et al.119 fabricated a ZnO–CdO hybrid NW array by fusing ZnO and CdO nanoparticles into the same nanowire. The hybrid nanowire array exhibited improved properties compared with pure ZnO and CdO, and it could be assembled into a fully transparent (95%) and flexible UV-visible photodetector with a wide spectral range response (400–800 nm), fast response speed (3 s), and high stability (>200 bending cycles).
Near infrared (NIR) photodetection shows a broad range of applications in biological/medical imaging, thermal imaging, telecommunication, target tracking, remote sensing, etc. Khalil et al.120 presented infrared photodetectors based on copper oxide (CuO) nanofibers synthesized in the form of a dense mesh via an electrospinning technique. The device exhibited a low response time (1–2 ms) when illuminated with an infrared laser diode (808 nm, 10–40 mW cm−2), due to its unique morphology defined by tiny crystalline domains attached in a linear 1D fashion, which provides a very high surface-to-volume ratio and efficient electron transport. Zheng et al. demonstrated an enhanced UV–vis–NIR photodetector based on electrospun ZnO NW array/PbS QD heterostructures that were constructed via ligand exchange121 (Fig. 6e). PbS QDs were chosen for NIR detection because of their inherent narrow (1.3 eV) and tunable bandgap. This heterostructure-based photodetector showed an enhanced response speed in the UV range and high flexibility/stability in the UV–vis–NIR range, even after extreme (up to 180°) and repeated (up to 200 cycles) bending conditions. This simple and effective electrospinning and ligand exchange process could also be applied to other 1D and 0D material heterostructures like ZnO/PbSe QDs and CdO/PbS QDs, evidencing the universality of this strategy. Hosseini et al.122 introduced high-performance UV–vis–NIR photodetectors based on the plasmonic effect in decorated ZnO nanofibers with optimized coverage of Au nanoparticles. The granular structure of the electrospun fibers improved the photodetection performance due to the existence of many grain boundaries. A 4 nm Au nominal thickness was found to provide the highest UV on/off ratio (∼460), and responsivity (∼332 A W−1), detectivity (∼2.93 × 1011 Jones) and faster rise and decay times compared with pure ZnO nanofibers, and an 8 nm Au nominal thickness increased the detection range from the UV to the vis–NIR region originating from the localized surface plasmon resonance absorption of the Au nanoparticles and effective separation and transport of photogenerated carriers.
Next-generation photodetectors designed with flexibility, transparency, multi-function and compact integration have attracted wide attention, and some new concepts of photodetectors based on 1D nanostructures are rapidly expanding, for example stretchable photodetectors111 that show great advances for wearable devices, self-powered photodetectors123 that enable wireless, light and compact applications, and humidity124 or strain125,126 assisted photodetectors that have tunable/enhanced detection performance. Although significant progress in electrospun-fiber-based photodetectors has been made, there is still a long way to go for their practical application. Table 3 summarizes the materials, process parameters and performance of the photodetection devices. How to improve the device performance, such as the bandwidth, efficiency and uniformity, is still challenging as it is a complex system optimization process involving ink design, printing/post-processing control, and the device interface manipulation.

3.3 Light-emitting devices via EHD jet printing and electrospinning
With the development of technology, lighting and displays are omnipresent in our lives. Compared with traditional liquid crystal displays, emerging flat-panel display technologies, like organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) and perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs), are considered as the next-generation display technology, due to their excellent performance in luminous efficacy, brightness and ultra-thin/flexible characteristics. Recently, intensive studies have been conducted on introducing semiconductor colloidal nanocrystals and organic semiconductors into inks. To enable the patterning/stacking of red-green-blue (RGB) inks into high-resolution, pixelated geometries with accurate position control and efficient material utilization, EHD printing techniques have been introduced.
The development of alternative OLED fabrication technologies for high-definition and low-cost displays is an important research topic as conventional fine metal mask-assisted vacuum evaporation has reached its limit in reducing pixel sizes and manufacturing costs. Recently, the EHD jet printing of organic small-molecule OLEDs with a pixel width as small as 5 μm (ref. 127) (Fig. 7a), and a passive matrix OLED display device of 2115 PPI (pixels per inch)128 has been reported. This resolution is beyond the capabilities of conventional inkjets, and exceeds the requirements for commercial OLED displays (e.g., >300 PPI), demonstrating the potential of EHD printing in the fabrication of high-definition and low-cost displays.

Copyright 2019, Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Quantum dots are nanoscale semiconducting crystals with size-dependent electrical/optical properties that can be exploited in devices like solid-state lighting, information displays and imaging detectors, due to their wide-range color tunability, high brightness, and narrow emission bandwidth. Kim et al.21 demonstrated high-resolution EHD printing of QD layers with a precisely controlled thickness and lateral resolution down to submicronmeter. By applying a bias voltage between a substrate and a metal-coated glass capillary with fine opening (e.g., 5 μm), QD ink could be pulled from the nozzle to the substrate to form micro/nanoscale dots, lines and films with a height resolution of tens of nanometers and a lateral resolution of sub-micrometer proportions. And an arbitrary patterning of QD layers could be realized by simultaneously controlling the substrate movement and driving voltage. The final EHD-printed green QLEDs and red QLEDs showed a maximum luminance and an EQE of 36000 cd m−2 and 2.5%, 11250 cd m−2 and 2.6%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7c. Li et al.22 employed EHD printing and a mixed solvent method to fabricate high-resolution pixelated QLEDs. By optimizing the mixed solvent ratio to obtain coffee-ring-free QD films, and introducing pixel-defining layers to prevent color mixing and device electric breakdown, high-resolution QLEDs with a pixel density of 306 PPI can be achieved.
Benefitting from the high printing resolution characteristics, EHD printing offers new capabilities for nanophotonics applications. Kress et al.129 used EHD printing to place fluorescent QD patterns with an arbitrary color, shape, and intensity in sub-diffraction resolution and nanometer precision on planar and structured substrates. The QDs could be electrostatically guided toward electromagnetic hotspots on structured plasmonic substrates, demonstrating a simple method for near-field light design for nanophotonics. Richner et al.130 prepared EHD printed full-color images with a diffraction-limited resolution based on red, green, and blue colloidal QDs, representing an RGB color space analogous to the one applied in modern displays, with a color gamut far exceeding the standard RGB norm.
Recently, hybrid perovskites have demonstrated great potential for display due to their tunable emission, high color purity, and strong photoluminescence/electroluminescence. To meet the requirements for full-color and high-resolution display applications, Zhu et al.131 introduced EHD printing to fabricate in situ crystallized perovskite patterns with high resolution (5 μm), strong PL, and full color via a simple precursor mixing of perovskite inks without adding antisolvent (Fig. 7d). Later, by using a smaller nozzle, nanoscale perovskite patterns have been achieved. Li et al.132 added long-chain PVP into the perovskite solution to increase the ink viscosity, which helps to eliminate the coffee ring and generate small perovskite grains due to spatial confinement during evaporation. Altintas et al.133 employed EHD printing to form closely spaced stripes of perovskite nanocrystals of various colors and integrated these films together to create a white LED with high photometric performance (color rendering index of 91.3, luminous efficacy of optical radiation >300 lm W−1opt, and correlated color temperature of ca. 7000 K). The as-printed full color, micrometer-scale patterns and pictures exhibit compatibility with flexible substrates, demonstrating the potential of EHD printing in future halide perovskite-based high-quality lighting/display manufacturing.
Compared with bulk materials or thin films, electrospun nanofibers have recently attracted great attention toward light-emitting nanofibers for their unique properties in terms of charge/energy transport and thermal dissipation due to their large length-to-diameter ratio. Fig. 8a134 shows that the electroluminescent fibers deposited from [Ru(bpy)3]2+(PF6−)2/PEO mixtures on gold interdigitated electrodes (with gaps of 5 μm and 500 nm) had low turn-on voltages (3–4 V), approaching the band gap limit of the organic semiconductor. As the size of the light source is determined by the inter-electrode spacing, emission from electrospun light-emitting nanofibers is confined to nanoscale dimensions, which is attractive for lab-on-a-chip integration. Yang et al.135 adopted coaxial-electrospinning to build a 1D electroluminescent device (composed of a liquid metal core cathode, an iTMCbased polymer shell layer, and an evaporated ITO anode layer) into a single self-supporting fiber at the sub-micrometer scale, as shown in Fig. 8b. Such 1D polymer light sources are flexible, lightweight, and conformable, and they exhibit great potential in applications of bioimaging, high-resolution microscopy, and flexible panel displays. Tsai et al.136 proposed coaxial-electrospinning to enable the in situ formation of perovskite-polymer core–shell fibers (Fig. 8c), which exhibit color-tunability by simply tuning the perovskite composition, and a high resistance to air and water owing to the hydrophobic characteristics of the polymer shell. Besides the direct use of the electrospun nanofibers, adopting them as a sacrificial layer is also important. For example, Cho et al.137 direct-write PVK fibers as pixel separator arrays to realize chemical additive-free pixel patterning for large-area OLED displays.

The above studies demonstrate the superiority of EHD printing in structural resolution (tens of nanometers to tens of micrometers). However, it faces problems of poor device performance and low manufacturing efficiency. The currently reported EQE of display devices fabricated by EHD printing is smaller than 5%,11,127 which is much lower than that of spin coating or vacuum evaporation (>25%).138–140 And these devices/patterns are all fabricated via a single nozzle, as there is no mature product of a multi-nozzle EHD printhead. To make the EHD printing technique practical in device manufacturing, it is imperative to improve the device performance and accelerate the development of addressable nozzle arrays.
3.4 Transparent electrodes via EHD jet printing and electrospinning
From section 3.1 to section 3.3, we have discussed the recent advances in the EHD deposition of solar cells, photodetectors and light-emitting devices. Apart from the photoactive layer, the transparent electrodes (TEs), which transmit light and conduct electrical current simultaneously, are also essential elements in optoelectronic devices. Currently, the commercially used TEs in most optoelectronic devices are made of ITO, generally prepared by evaporation and sputtering, facing problems of material waste and expensive fabrication, and incompatible with flexible/stretchable requirements. EHD printing, which enables the nano- to micro-pattering of various conducting inks or precursors into interconnects, electrodes and contact pads, has attracted growing interest in the fabrication of transparent, flexible/stretchable conducting electrodes.
Generally, the preparation of TEs by EHD printing can be divided into three ways: (1) direct deposition of conductive materials, e.g., Au, Ag, Cu nanoparticles/nanowires, CNT, and graphene; (2) transforming EHD-printed precursor solutions into conductive patterns through reduction or carbonization processes; and (3) using EHD-printed patterns as a high-precision template, upon which metal or other functional materials are deposited by sputtering or evaporation processes.
Silver nanoparticles suspended in organic solvents are the most widely studied ink for patterning conductive tracks by EHD-jet printing, and an annealing process is required to remove ligands that cover the nanoparticles and sinter the particles into a continuous dense structure. Prasetyo et al.141 conducted a detailed study of the uniformity of EHD-jet printed silver dots and achieved uniform dot patterns below 10 μm. They found that on hydrophobic silicon wafers, increasing the substrate temperature and the number of overprints could be used as an alternative method to increase the aspect ratio of dot and suppress the coffee-ring effect. Zhou et al.142 combined EHD printing and the coffee-ring effect to obtain ring structures with linewidths below 50 nm, and these interconnected nano-rings also have significant potential in TE applications. Yu et al.143 prepared highly viscous suspensions of silver nanoparticles with a diameter of 10 nm in deionized water to which polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was added, and achieved an average sheet resistance of 0.037 Ω after thermal curing (200 °C for one hour), which was twice that of bulk silver. Jang et al.144 adjusted the line-to-line pitch of the Ag-grid to balance the electrical and optical properties of TEs (Fig. 9a). At a grid spacing of 150 μm, the EHD jet-printed TE had a sheet resistance of 4.87 Ω sq−1 and a transmittance of 81.75% after annealing at 200 °C. Schneider et al.145 utilized EHD nanodripping to deposit 3D silver/gold metal grids with invisible line widths from 80 to 500 nm; these nanoscale 3D grids improve the electrical performance while maintaining the optical transmittance at a high level (97% at a sheet resistance of 20 Ω sq−1) (Fig. 9b). Wei et al.146 extended this deposition process to insulate substrates by using AC-pulsed voltage. Ag patterns deposited by an AC voltage had alternate charge polarity to ensure that the residue charge on the substrate was neutralized. Similarly, copper147 and aluminium148 nanoparticles have been printed through EHD techniques.

Besides nanoparticles, nanowires,149 two-dimensional nanomaterials150,151 and low-melting-point metal alloys152 have also been deposited into conductive patterns via EHD techniques. For example, Lee et al.149 successfully aligned the AgNWs inside an electrospun AgNWs/PEO composite ribbon by using NFES, where the shear effect caused by the velocity distribution of the charged jet near the nozzle tip is one of the main factors for orderly aligning (Fig. 9c). Cui et al.153 also used a AgNW/PEO solution to realize the printing of AgNWs on various substrates, including PDMS, PET, glass, paper, and polycarbonate filter (Fig. 9d). After post-treatment to remove PEO, AgNW patterns with a high conductivity (∼5.6 × 106 S m−1) can be obtained. Low-melting-point metal alloys, which can be printed combined with a heating process, represent another promising way to create conductive paths with excellent conductivity and flexibility.152
The pyrolysis of polymer and metal precursors along with the nucleation and growth of metal nanoparticles is a common strategy to prepare conductive nanowire arrays or grids. For example, Lee et al.154 successfully transformed electrospun poly(vinylpyrollidone) (PVP) and Cu(II) trifluoroacetate (Cu(CO2CF3)2, CTA) composite nanofibers into polycrystalline Cu nanofibers by two steps of calcination (Fig. 10a). The prepared Cu nanofiber has a diameter of about 710 nm and a resistivity of 14.1 μΩ cm, which is slightly higher than that of bulk Cu (1.68 μΩ cm). Similarly, by replacing the composite of PVP/CTA with that of PVP/silver trifluoroacetate (STA)/CTA, individually controlled AgNW with an average diameter of about 695 nm and a low resistivity (5.7 μΩ cm, comparable to that of bulk Ag 1.6 μΩ cm) were achieved followed by one calcination step in ambient air.155 Recently, 2D sheet-type AgNW transparent electrodes with a high transparency (94.7%), low sheet resistance (26.9 Ω−1) and low optical haze (<1%) have been fabricated for OLED application by a precise control of the position and orientation of the AgNWs during printing. The green OLED device with stripe-patterned AgNWs showed a higher maximum current efficiency and external quantum efficiency (100.1 cd A−1, 25%) than the ITO-based device (86.3 cd A−1, 20.7%)155 (Fig. 10b). Bai et al.156 utilized a rotatable substrate to realize the continuous fabrication of extra-long (in kilometers range) silver fibers with a minimum diameter of around 200 nm from AgNO3/PVP composite precursors (Fig. 10c). This approach enabled high-throughput production (∼8 m s−1), as well as freestanding, suspended ultrathin fibers and woven mats with high performance (7 Ω sq−1 at 96%) and remarkable flexibility.

Using electrospun fibers as a mask represents another promising way to create high-performance TEs. Azuma et al.157 obtained transparent Al nanowire networks with a high transmittance and low sheet resistance (80%, 45 Ω sq−1) by depositing PS nanofibers on an Al-coated film, followed by etching the unmasked Al and dissolving the PS mask. The electrospun mask is not limited to a linear or planar structure: it can be a complex serpentine pattern or 3D pattern by controlling the movement path of the electrospinning jet, as shown in Fig. 10d.158 Min et al.159 utilized well-aligned organic nanowire arrays as metallization templates (Fig. 10e). By electroless plating of a metal layer on the surface of printed ONWs, a core–sheath structured conducting NW array with low resistivity (7.5 μΩ cm), high optical transmittance (>90%) and flexibility was attained.
4. Summary and outlook
EHD jetting is an emerging deposition technology that is capable of producing high-resolution micro/nano-features for a wide range of functional materials on various substrates, including unconventional flexible and stretchable substrates. Along with different process conditions and ink properties, EHD jetting is applicable for creating mist drops by electrospraying, micro/nanofibers by electrospinning and micro/nanodroplets by EHD jet printing, making it suitable for optoelectronics device fabrication, as it can fulfil all the requirements for high-performance solar cells (uniform thin films), displays (high resolution patterns), and sensors/detectors (structures with a large specific surface area).
In this review, we first discussed the tunability of the jetting modes, and summarized the development of each jetting mode. The influences of ink properties (e.g., conductivity, surface tension, viscosity, dielectric constant) and process parameters (e.g., flow rate, voltage, nozzle size, stand-off height, environment) on the concrete jetting behaviours are discussed, which help people better understand and utilize this technique. We also introduced the development of multi-nozzle arrays to enhance the deposition efficiency and some special nozzle types to realize heterostructure deposition. Then we summarized the recent advances of EHD deposition techniques in optoelectronics fabrication, including high-performance polymer/dye-sensitized/perovskite solar cells fabricated via electrospray, UV/visible/NIR photodetectors realized by electrospinning, high-resolution OLED/QLED/PeLEDs realized by EHD jet printing, and transparent/flexible Au/Ag/Cu electrodes via EHD jet printing or electrospinning. These encouraging achievements prove that EHD deposition techniques have great potential in optoelectronics manufacturing.
In spite of the considerable achievements of EHD deposition, the following issues are suggested for further consideration. (1) Further understanding of the EHD jetting mechanism. EHD jetting is a complex process, and whether the cone-jet is stable and which jetting mode it may experience are influenced by a combination of ink properties and process parameters. Although there have been some scaling laws for EHD jetting, it is still difficult to predict the complex electrorheological behaviour, and the success with EHD deposition is mostly achieved by conducting experiments. Systematic studies that establish relationships between the jetting mode, the ink properties, and the deposition conditions would be of great value. (2) Improvements in the performance of EHD-deposited optoelectronic devices. The research into the EHD deposition of optoelectronics has just begun, and there is still a large gap in device performance compared with other technologies. For example, the device efficiency of EHD-deposited solar cells or light-emitting diodes is far behind that fabricated by conventional processes like spin coating or vacuum evaporation (<18%160vs. >29%161 for solar cells, and <5%11,127vs. >25%140 for light-emitting devices). It is important to optimize ink properties, substrate wettability and the deposition environment to regulate the structural morphologies and device performance. (3) Improvement of deposition efficiency. For the fabrication of large area devices, printheads with large-scale nozzles (e.g., >1000) are imperative, which requires eliminating the crosstalk between electrified jets, and designing a corresponding drive control system. These efforts will accelerate the transition of EHD deposition technology from laboratory research to a commercially competitive manufacturing technology.
