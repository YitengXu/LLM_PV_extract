    , Accepted 15th January 2019First published on 16th January 2019AbstractEngineering crystals of titanium dioxide (TiO2) to expose the most reactive facet has been proved to significantly improve its photocatalytic performance. While most TiO2 with facets reported in the past was in a particle form, herein we directly grow TiO2 with arbitrarily tunable facets onto a transparent conductive substrate. This could reduce interparticle boundaries, and thus suppress charge recombination and facilitate more efficient charge transport compared to particle-assembled films. Combined systematic experimental and theoretical (density functional theory, DFT) studies reveal that fluoride ions (F−) and protons (H+) could play a synergistic role in controlling TiO2 crystals in the way that F− ions change the crystal phase of TiO2 to anatase with low-index facets, while H+ ions increase the {001}/{101} ratio. Moreover, the reductive and oxidative sites of facets are clearly elucidated by selective photodeposition of a noble metal and metal oxide. Different photocatalytic tests manifested that the {001} facet, which is conventionally believed to be the most reactive facet, does not always show the highest performance. On the other hand, the facets' reactivity appeared to depend on the types of reactions (reduction or oxidation) and the co-existing synergy of facets. These findings would provide a clear understanding of the true factors controlling facets, and the true order of reactivity of each facet that has remained controversial, and pave a way to improve both the efficiency and selectivity of TiO2 in a wide variety of photocatalytic applications in the future.
Introduction
In heterogeneous catalysis, surface properties of catalysts are critical factors determining catalytic performance. Crystal facet control is the basis of strategies to improve the surface properties and enhance both the catalytic reactivity and selectivity of catalysts, due to the difference in the inherent atomic configuration and coordination in a particular facet.1 The conventional understanding is that the facets with a larger amount of lower-coordinated atoms and higher surface energy are usually more active.2–4 Unfortunately, high energy facets are rapidly dominated by lower energy facets during crystal growth processes. A typical example is anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2), the major photocatalyst extensively utilized in various energy and environmental applications.5–12 According to the Wulff construction, the lower reactive {101} facet of anatase is more thermodynamically stable (surface energy = 0.44 J m−2) than the higher reactive {001} facet (surface energy = 0.90 J m−2), and dominates more than 90% of the single-crystalline particles of anatase under equilibrium conditions.13 In 2008, Yang et al. predicted that, among various ions theoretically studied, fluorine ions (F−) could reduce the relative surface energy of {001} facets to lower than that of {101} facets, and the amount of {001} facets was experimentally increased to 47% by using hydrofluoric acid (HF) as the F− source.14 This breakthrough spurred the research on facet-engineered TiO2 crystals to be one of the hottest research topics in the past decade.15 The initial focus of the following research studies was on further increasing the percentage of {001} facets, until nearly 100% {001} facets could be achieved, generally by increasing the concentration of HF.16–19 Hence, it has been concluded by many studies that the percentage of {001} facets could be increased with respect to the increase of the amount of F− ions.4,19,20
However, these facet-controlled syntheses of TiO2 typically provided products in a particle form, which could be unbeneficial when assembled to fabricate photoelectrodes. In photovoltaic devices such as solar cells, photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells, and optoelectronic glasses, grain boundaries between particles could obstruct the mobility of charge carriers and also act as charge recombination centers deteriorating the performance of the devices.21 Therefore, developing photoelectrodes with fewer interparticle boundaries but a highly reactive surface has been highly desirable. Many previous studies have demonstrated that nanostructures directly grown onto conductive substrates, especially vertically aligned nanostructures, show superior performance in photovoltaic devices compared to the assembled nanoparticle films, due to reduced grain boundaries facilitating fast charge transport and collection.22–26 Nevertheless, it remains a challenging task to directly grow anatase with tunable reactive facets on transparent conductive glass substrates, which could be beneficial for various applications in optoelectronic devices. Moreover, the true order of reactivity of facets is still controversial. Many reports in the later years showed that anatase with a larger percentage of {001} facets does not always have higher photocatalytic reactivity than the lower percentage one,2,20,27–29 but the reasons and mechanisms are still unclear. The prerequisite to determine the true order of facet reactivity is to obtain crystals with different facets by an identical synthetic route; however, this has long been a big challenging task. Although there have been some successful cases of direct growth of faceted anatase on transparent conductive glass substrates reported,30,31 to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports on systematically tuning the percentage of facets of anatase nanostructures that are directly grown on transparent conductive substrates by one synthetic route.
In the present work, we develop a one-pot hydrothermal synthesis which can directly grow vertically aligned nanostructures of anatase with tunable percentages of {101}, {001}, and {010} facets on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. Our synthesis method using only one synthetic route to comprehensively tune the morphology thus makes precise comparison of their photocatalytic behaviors possible. In contrast to the conventional understanding that increasing the amount of F− ions results in a larger percentage of {001} facets, our systematic study revealed that protons (H+) actually appear to increase the percentage amount of {001} facet towards that of the other facets rather than F− ions. Combination of the experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveals that F− ions play a role in changing the crystal phase to anatase with low-index facets, while H+ ions diminish the growth of {101} facets, resulting in an increase of the {001}/{101} ratio. Moreover, direct evidence of oxidative and reductive selectivities of these facets is clearly elucidated by selective deposition of a metal and metal oxide. We found that the samples dominated by {101}, {001}, and {010} facets are specifically suitable for different applications, possibly due to the oxidative and reductive powers of these facets as well as their synergistic effects.
Results and discussion
We started the study under the hydrothermal synthetic conditions reported by Liu et al.22 that can directly grow TiO2 nanostructures on a FTO substrate using hydrochloric acid (HCl), water, and tetrabutyl titanate (TTBT). This condition (Exp. 0 in Table 1) successfully provides vertically aligned rutile nanorods, as shown in Fig. 1c, and we use this condition as a reference. Then, only one more chemical substance (ammonium hexafluorotitanate, AFT), which acts as a F− source, was added into the system to study the effect of F− ions. Unlike the conventional method using HF, in this work H+ and F− ions come from different sources, namely, HCl and AFT, respectively, which can separately clarify the effects of each type of ion. Interestingly, as shown in the schematic image (Fig. 1a), when 0.20 g of AFT was simply added in Exp. 0, both the morphology and crystallinity of TiO2 are changed. The X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. 1b) indicate that the characteristic peaks of rutile (101) and (002) at two theta (2θ) = 36.0 and 62.7° (PDF-01-089-0554) disappeared after adding AFT. On the other hand, appearance of the unique peaks of anatase (101), (200), (211), and (204) at 2θ = 25.3, 48.0, 55.0, and 62.6° (PDF-01-070-8505), respectively, confirms that the crystal phase was changed to anatase. Moreover, as seen in Fig. 1c and d which are the cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the films on FTO, rutile nanorods are transformed to anatase bounded by clear facets ({101} and {001}). These results are consistent with the top-view observation shown in Fig. 1e and f. Microstructural analyses by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) reveal a different atomic construction in both structures. As shown in Fig. 1g, the HRTEM image of a rutile nanorod reveals an interplanar spacing of ∼0.32 and ∼0.29 nm, corresponding to the characteristic d110 and d001 of rutile, respectively. On the other hand, HRTEM of an anatase plate (Fig. 1h) shows two orthogonal lattice spacings of 0.19 nm, corresponding to the characteristic d200 and d020 planes of anatase. The SAED patterns of both the rutile nanorod and the anatase nanoplate (insets of Fig. 1g and h, respectively) show spot patterns, indicating that both are single-crystalline nanostructures and were taken at [1–10]22 and [001]14 zone axes, respectively.

The above mentioned evidence strongly indicates that F− ions play a key role in both crystal phase transformation and structural reconstruction during crystal growth. To gain insight into this role, DFT calculations were performed. Under Wulff construction equilibrium, the {110} facet is the most stable facet of rutile, while that of anatase is {101}.7 Therefore, we calculated the surface energies at various F− coverages based on these two facets, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. As seen in Fig. 2a, without F− on the surface (0.0 monolayer, ML), the surface energy of the rutile {110} facet (γR110 = 0.60 J m−2) is lower than that of the anatase {101} facet (γA101 = 0.67 J m−2). Thus, the rutile {110} facet is more favorable than the anatase {101} facet which agrees with Exp. 0 that without F− ions, only rutile nanorods are obtained. When F− ions are gradually adsorbed more on the surfaces, both γR110 and γA101 decrease but the effect is more pronounced on the anatase {101} facet. γA101 clearly switches to become lower than γR110 at a F− coverage of approximately 0.7 ML, as seen in Fig. 2b–c. This agrees with the experiment that anatase particles with facets begin to appear after ∼0.10 g of AFT was added in Exp. 0, when we tested the effects of trace amounts of AFT as seen in ESI S1.† A theoretical study has demonstrated the effect of F− ions in inducing lower surface energies of the anatase {101} facet compared to the rutile {110} facet, which results in more rutile phase transformation into anatase with facets when a sufficient amount of AFT is added. This is in excellent agreement with the experimental results, as only anatase with clear facets is observed when the amount of AFT is larger than 0.20 g (see Exp. 1–Exp. 3 in the next section).

(b and c) Top view of atomic models of rutile (110) and anatase (101) at ∼0.7 ML of F− coverage, where the favourability of rutile (110) and anatase (101) is switched. The corresponding structures of each F− coverage are shown in ESI S10.† 
We comprehensively studied the other crucial factors that could affect the crystal growth, namely, the amount of F−, H+, and Ti4+ ions, reaction temperature, and reaction time, by systematically varying these factors. Totally, 20 synthetic conditions were examined and separately discussed in detail in ESI S2,† and the conditions that cause significant morphological changes are selected for discussion in the main text (in Table 1). First, we further investigated the effect of the amount of F− ions by increasing the amount of AFT from 0.20 g to 0.40 and 0.60 g (Exp. 1–3 in Table 1). Interestingly, it was found that the thickness of the crystals increased with respect to the increase of AFT, as shown in the corresponding SEM images in Fig. 3a–c. The thickness of the particles synthesized under the conditions Exp. 1, 2 and 3 was ∼121, 165 and 383 nm, respectively, and the corresponding percentage of the {001} facet in the three samples quantified by Raman spectra32 was 66.53, 32.71, and 11.13%, respectively (the detailed calculation can be found in ESI S3†). This evidence strongly suggests that increasing F− ions does not directly increase the ratio of {001} facets in the particles. On the other hand, when the amount of AFT was fixed at a particular value and then the amount of H+ ions was varied by increasing the volume ratio of 37% HCl:H2O from 45.8 to 54.2 and 58.3 vol% (Exp. 4–6 in Table 1), the resultant crystals became thinner with respect to the increase of HCl concentration, as shown in Fig. 3d–f. In other words, increasing H+ ions increases the ratio of {001} facets in a crystal by preferentially suppressing the growth of {101} facets. Note that anatase crystals in a particle form also follow a similar trend (discussed separately in detail in ESI S4†). Additionally, DFT calculations were applied to calculate the surface energies of (001) and (101) facets at various coverages of H+ while the coverage of F− was fixed at approximately 0.5 ML (Fig. 3g). Fig. 3g shows that the surface energies of (001) facets are lower than those of (101) facets at all varied H+ coverages, and the gap between the two gradually becomes larger with respect to an increase of H+ coverage. Thus, a larger amount of H+ favors the growth of (001) facets than (101) facets which agrees with the experimental observation. The approximately 0.5 ML of fixed F− coverage was selected due to the relatively close surface energies of A(101) and A(001) surfaces when H+ is not present on the surfaces. Also, the fixed coverage of F− was varied between 0.5 and 1.0 ML with the presence of H+ coverage at 1 ML. The results showed the lower surface energies of A(001) than A(101) (ESI S10–S4†) yielding a similar suggestion that the large amount of H+ favors the growth of (001) facets rather than (101) facets.

(g) Calculated surface energies of (101) and (001) facets at various H+ coverages when the F− coverage is fixed at approximately 0.5 ML. The corresponding structures of each coverage are shown in ESI S10.† (h) Schematic figure demonstrating the roles of F− and H+ ions. F− ions act as low-index controlling agents, while H+ ions act as {001} cutting agents, increasing the ratio of {001} facets to the other facets in anatase particles. 

Fig. 3h summarizes the roles of F− and H+ ions based on the aforementioned findings. In this case, F− ions induce the change of the TiO2 crystal structure from rutile to anatase and play a role in keeping the morphology of anatase enclosed by low-index facets. On the other hand, H+ ions act as {001}-cutting planes making the crystals thinner, thus increasing the relative percentage of {001} facets. Importantly, this evidence is contrary to conventional understanding.19 Conventional studies indicated that increasing F− ions promotes a larger percentage of {001} facets in a particle which is possibly because most reports used hydrofluoric acid (HF) as a shape-controlling agent.17,19,20,33 Thus, increasing the amount of HF means both F− ions and H+ ions were simultaneously increased. This would lead to an unclear understanding of the roles of each type of ion species.
To ensure that the morphology change is affected by F− and H+ ions, and not the other ions in the system, such as Cl− (from HCl) and NH4+ (from AFT), we further conducted additional experiments using H+ and Cl− from other sources, which is discussed in detail in ESI S5.† The results show that Cl− and NH4+ ions in this system do not have a pivotal effect on the morphology and the percent ratio of {001} facets in the TiO2 particles, as when the other acid (acetic acid) and the other source of F− ions (titanium fluoride, TiF4) were used instead of HCl and AFT, anatase TiO2 with low-index facets was also successfully constructed in the same way as varying the amount of HCl and AFT. Moreover, the influence of the amount of Ti4+ precursor was also investigated, as discussed in ESI S2.† Basically, the amount of Ti4+ precursor has an effect on the density of TiO2 particles on FTO and also the thickness of TiO2 particles. As seen from Fig. S2.10–S2.13,† the thickness and density of the particles on FTO increased with respect to an increase of Ti4+ precursor; however, the particles keep exposing {001}–{101} facets.
Based on the results in the previous sections that the particle thickness was increased when the amount of F− ions and Ti4+ precursor were increased and the amount of H+ ions was decreased, we tried to further increase the amount of Ti4+ and F− ions and decreased the amount of H+ in the synthesis (conditions Exp. 8–10 in Table 1). As a result, as shown in Fig. 4a, interesting morphological changes were observed during the crystal growth process. It was found that the {010} facet gradually appears replacing the {101} facet in the crystal. As seen from Fig. 4b, which is the resultant product of condition Exp. 7, the particles expose trapezoidal {101} and square {001} facets with the angle of ∼68.3°. When the amount of Ti4+ and F− ions was further increased but the amount of H+ ions was decreased according to condition Exp. 8, there was a co-existence of {101}, {010}, and {001} facets in the resultant particles, as shown in Fig. 4c. The side-view of these particles (inset of Fig. 4c) clearly shows that the {101} facet is cut by the {010} facet and just few {101} facets are left in the particles. The angle of 90° between the {001} facet and this cutting plane confirms that this cutting plane is the {010} facet. These shapes are consistent with the prediction of anatase crystals with low-index facets by Barnard and Curtiss.34 Moreover, when the amount of Ti4+ and F− ions was further increased and the amount of H+ was further decreased according to condition Exp. 9, the {101} facet completely fades out, and only {010} and {001} facets dominate the surface of particles, as shown in Fig. 4d.

The effects of the reaction time and the reaction temperature were also investigated and discussed in detail in ESI S2.† Generally, it was found that the particles grew to larger sizes when the reaction time was longer. The result also showed that the particles appeared to grow faster when the reaction temperature was higher. However, the reactions occurring outside the temperature range of 130–180 °C cause irregular shapes of the particles. Noticeably, when the ratio of H+, F−, and Ti4+ was kept the same, the dominant facets in the crystal did not change with respect to the reaction time and temperature. However, when the low amount of 37% HCl (below 33.3 vol%) was used in the reaction, the crystals with facets seem to reach their full-grown stage much quicker than the crystals grown under the conditions with the higher amount of H+. Through a prolonged period of reaction, small spherical particles could be generated and deposited on the surface of the faceted crystals. For example, the crystals synthesized under the conditions shown in ESI S6† reached their full-grown stage with clear facets within just five hours. After that, when the reaction was allowed for ten hours, there were some spherical particles decorating on the surface of the faceted crystals, and these spherical particles fully covered the surface of the faceted crystal after 20 hours. Therefore, to obtain clear facets in the case of low-H+ conditions, the reaction time must be shortened, and the reaction temperature should be kept between 130 and 170 °C. This result is in agreement with a previous report, showing that a shorter reaction time was needed when a lower amount of acid was used in the system.2
To determine the true order of photocatalytic reactivity of facets, it is necessary to obtain various facets by an identical synthetic route. This ensures that the photoreactivity would dominantly be influenced by facets, and not by other factors, such as, capping agents on the surface, additives used during particle assembly to form a thin film and assembly skills. Our developed technique successfully controls anatase crystals exposing delicately tunable facets on the conductive FTO substrate which could limit the effects of other factors. Thus, the technique allows precise facet photoreactivity comparison. Based on the new understanding mentioned above, we tune the crystals and select the samples that expose clearly different facets. As shown in Fig. 5a–c, the anatase crystals dominated by {101}, {010} and {001} facets were denoted as A101, A010 and A001, respectively, while the crystal co-exposing facets {101}–{001} and {010}–{001} were denoted as A101–001 and A010–001 as shown in Fig. 5d and e, respectively. The specific conditions to synthesize these samples are shown in Table 1 (Exp. 10–14). Basically, UV-visible light absorption spectra exhibit a blue shift when the particles become thinner (see ESI S7†), possibly caused by the increase of the conduction band minimum of the {001} facet35 (their transmission spectra and calculated band gaps are also found in ESI S7†). Therefore, the band gaps gradually become larger with respect to an increase in the {001} facet ratio in the samples. However, the shifts in the light absorption spectra and corresponding band gaps seem to have no clear effects on photoreactivity in two different types of photocatalytic reactions tested; namely, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting and photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction, as the results from the two tests showed contrasting trends. As seen from Fig. 5g, the i–t curves of the selected films tested in PEC water splitting showed that A001 can generate the highest photocurrent of 0.46 mA cm−2, which is almost two fold greater than that generated from the second most active A001–101 (0.24 mA cm−2), followed by A001–010, A010, and A101 which can generate photocurrent of 0.17, 0.08 and 0.07 mA cm−2, respectively (the time-resolved gas evolution generated by these samples can be found in ESI S8†). It turned out that the photocurrent is increased with respect to the increase of the percentage of {001} facets, which was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy (ESI S3†), the most precise technique to quantify the percentage of {001} facets of TiO2.32

All SEM images in this figure were taken at an identical magnification (×50k). (f) i–t curve of the films tested in PEC water splitting. The applied potential was 0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and 1 M KOH was used as an electrolyte. (g) Reduced CO2 products tested in CO2 photoreduction. 
Interestingly, the order of photoreactivity of the films tested in CO2 photoreduction seemed to have the opposite trends to the PEC water splitting test. As shown in Fig. 5h, A001 showed the lowest photocatalytic reactivity among the single-facet dominant samples (A101, A010, and A001), as the total reduced CO2 products (carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4)) generated by this sample were just 0.266 μmol h−1 cm−2, while that of A101 and A010 were 0.417 and 0.629 μmol h−1 cm−2, respectively (the time-resolved reduced CO2 products generated by a particular sample and the detailed turnover number can be found in ESI S9†). Besides, it is noticeable that A010 appeared to be more selective to CH4 among the samples tested. Moreover, it was found that the co-existence of facets boosted the overall photocatalytic performance, especially in the case of A010–001 which can generate the highest total reduced CO2 products of 0.807 μmol h−1 cm−2. The results agree with the previous reports demonstrating that co-exposure of facets showed more promising photocatalytic CO2 reduction than {001} facets.20,36 The proposed reason for photocatalytic enhancement was that a mixture of facets could help charge separation and thus shows higher photoreactivity than the {001}-dominated samples.37
In addition, it is noticeable that CH4 productivity in A010 was approximately four times higher than that in the second best performing A001–010, as the CH4 production rate over A010 was 0.199 μmol h−1 cm−2, while that of A001–010 was 0.049 μmol h−1 cm−2. It would be considered that the amount of CH4 was increased with respect to an increase of {010} facets in the crystals. This result suggests that the {010} facet could be more kinetically favorable than the other facets, as CO2-to-CH4 conversion proceeds via an eight-electron pathway, while CO2-to-CO conversion is a two-electron process, according to the equations below:38 CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → CO + H2O(1) CO2 + 8H+ + 8e− → CH4 + 2H2O(2)
The true reactivity order of facet-engineered TiO2 has been still a controversial issue. Many reports claimed that TiO2 with a higher percentage of {001} facets showed higher photocatalytic reactivity than that with a lower percentage,35,39–42 but reports in later years revealed contrasting results in many applications,2,20,27,28,36,37 possibly due to the multitude of different testing conditions. In other words, the samples with a higher percentage of {001} facets do not always show superior photocatalytic reactivity. However, the reason why the photocatalytic reactivities in various applications are not well aligned is still unclear, as there was no palpable direct evidence. We also observed a contrasting trend of photoreactivity of facets in the two different types of photocatalytic tests (PEC water splitting and photocatalytic CO2 reduction as mentioned above).
To clarify these conflicting results, we tried to perform selective photodeposition of a noble metal and a metal oxide on the facets of TiO2 crystals. This selective deposition is very powerful to verify the oxidative and reductive sites and spatial charge separation in a microcrystal.43,44 In this study, silver (Ag) and manganese oxide (MnO2) were used as the indicators. Ag particles are likely to deposit on electron-rich parts of the crystal, while MnO2 particles prefer to deposit on hole-rich parts (see Fig. 6a) according to the following equations: Ag+ + e− → Ag0(3) Mn2+ + 2H2O + 2h+ → MnO2 + 4H+(4)
 Fig. 6  (a) Schematic demonstration of selective photodeposition of Ag and MnO2 on TiO2 films with different facets. (b–d) SEM images showing Ag photodeposition on A101–001 to A101–010 and A010, respectively. (e–g) SEM images showing MnO2 photodeposition on A101–001 to A101–010 and A010, respectively. 
Selective photodeposition disclosed interesting phenomena. We purposely selected samples with clearly different facets and tested them in the same reaction batch to ensure that the reaction was performed under identical conditions. Interestingly, it was found that Ag particles selectively anchored on {101} and {010} facets (Fig. 6b–d), while hair-like MnO2 particles selectively deposited only on the {001} facet. This evidence strongly suggests that the {001} facet is preferable for oxidative reactions, while the {101} and {010} facets are more selective to reduction reactions. This could explain why A001 was the most active in PEC water splitting, and the reactivity decreased when the ratio of {001} facets decreased (ESI S6†). On the other hand, the samples with a larger percentage of {001} facets appeared less active for reduction reactions such as CO2 photoreduction. As clearly shown in Fig. 6b–d, the particle size of Ag is larger in the sample dominated by {010} facets. As seen in Fig. 6b and d, the particle size of Ag in the {010} dominant sample (Fig. 6d) is much larger than that in the {101} dominant sample (Fig. 6b), although the deposition conditions were identical (see the Experimental section). This evidence would suggest that, among the facets which prefer reduction reactions, the {010} facet has higher reduction power than the {101} facet. This also supports the fact that the samples with {010} facets (A001–010, and A001) generated a larger amount of reduced CO2 products compared to the sample with {101} facets (A001–101), and the sample with a larger percentage of {010} facets can produce a larger amount of CH4, which requires more electrons.
In addition, based on this selective photodeposition evidence, we propose that the co-existence of reductive and oxidative facets such as {001}–{101} and {001}–{010} in a particle could encourage spatial separation of electrons (e−) and holes (h+) to move in a different direction in a particle.20,36,37 Charge recombination could be consequently suppressed, which results in the enhanced photocatalytic performance for applications without applied bias like CO2 photoreduction. For example, A001–101 and A001–010 showed more than two-fold larger reduced CO2 products compared to that of A001. On the other hand, in the application with applied bias, it has a better exposed facet that is selective to a particular reaction as much as possible. In the PEC water splitting, for instance, when TiO2 films act as a photoanode for oxidizing water molecules, the samples with a larger ratio of {001} facets which are selective to oxidation reactions showed higher photocatalytic reactivity (Fig. 5e). Particularly, A001 which has nearly one hundred percentage of {001} facets exhibited distinctively superior performance in this application. This is because the {001} facet is likely to attract h+ for performing oxidation reactions and repel e− to other facets due to a slight difference in the band edge potentials of these facets.20 Without applied bias, e− would quickly recombine with h+ because the particles do not have a spatial charge separation effect, resulting in poor performance. On the other hand, with applied bias, e− could be extracted to the counter electrode efficiently, leaving h+ for oxidative reaction at {001} facets, thus maximum PEC performance can be achieved in A001.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we successfully controlled the growth of single-crystalline anatase to expose various facets directly on a conductive FTO substrate. The vertically aligned TiO2 nanostructures directly grown on FTO could reduce interparticle boundaries, and enhance the contact between the material film and the substrate, thus promoting efficient charge transport and collection compared to particle-assembled films. A systematic experimental study of the factors affecting facet growth combined with a theoretical study revealed the fact that could challenge the conventional understanding. It was clarified that although F− ions play a significant role in keeping the morphology of anatase to expose low-index facets but do not increase the percentage of {001} facets. In fact, the amount of H+ ions increases the percentage of {001} facets instead of the increase of F− ions. Moreover, facets with oxidative and reductive powers of anatase were explicitly elucidated by tangible evidence. Our developed synthetic method makes it possible to tune the ratio of facets to optimize photocatalytic performance in different applications, as demonstrated in PEC water splitting and carbon dioxide photoreduction. This finding could broaden the fundamental knowledge of crystal facet control, and pave a way for improving both the reactivity and selectivity of TiO2 in various photocatalytic applications.
Experimental section
Synthesis
Anatase particles enclosed with various facets can be grown on an FTO substrate by mixing x mL of deionized (DI) water with 60–x mL of 37% hydrochloric acid (HCl, Carlo Erba) in a 200 mL beaker under continuous stirring. Then, 0.5–1.5 mL of tetrabutyl titanate (≥98%, Acros Organics) and 0–0.8 g of ammonium hexafluorotitanate (99%, Acros Organics) were respectively added, and the mixture was further mechanically stirred until a clear solution was observed. After that, the mixture was poured into a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) autoclave containing two pieces of 1.5 × 5 cm2 fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates (OPV tech, 7–8 Ω □−1) with the FTO side facing down against the wall of the PTFE-liner. The PTFE vessel was fitted with a stainless-steel shell, and heated in an oven with an assigned temperature (140–180 °C). After a desirable reaction time (5–24 h), the reaction vessel was allowed to cool down naturally to room temperature. The resultant TiO2-coated FTO was taken out from the reaction vessel and rinsed with a copious amount of DI water. The film was then dried in a vacuum oven (80 °C) for 12 h, and calcined at 600 °C (the ramp rate was 2 degrees min−1) for 2 h in a muffle furnace under ambient conditions to remove fluorine ions capped on the surface of TiO2 before further use.
Characterization
The morphology of TiO2 products was observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi SU8030) operated at 10–15 kV. Microstructural characteristics were investigated using a transmission electron microscope (JEOL 2100Plus) operated at 200 kV. A Bruker D8 Advanced X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (wavelength = 1.54060 Å) was used to determine the crystalline phases of the films. Raman spectra were measured using an NTEGRA Spectra (NT-MDT). UV-visible light absorption spectra of various films were measured using a Genesys 10S UV-vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Hitachi AFM5300E) was used to evaluate the roughness and surface area of the thin films.
PEC test
PEC water splitting was performed in a standard three-electrode configuration. The working, counter and reference electrodes were the as-prepared TiO2-coated FTO, a platinum wire, and Ag/AgCl, respectively. Simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G) was generated using a Newport LCS-100 (100 W). Photoelectrochemical measurement was performed on a PalmSens Potentiostat. 1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) was used as an electrolyte. The reaction chamber was purged with nitrogen gas around 20 minutes prior to the measurement. For obtaining i–t curves, 0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied, and light was focussed on the front side of the working electrode with an aperture diameter of 1 cm. The generated gases were collected at a regular time interval (30 min) and analysed using a gas chromatograph (SHIMADZU GC-2010Plus) equipped with a RESTEK column (ShinCarbon ST 80/100), and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Argon (99.995%) was used as the carrier gas.
Photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction test
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was conducted in a continuous-flow system. The main reactor was made of stainless-steel with a quartz glass seal at the top. The internal diameter and depth are 60 mm and 10 mm, respectively. The incident light was from a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300UV, Perfect Light Co. Ltd, China) with an AM 1.5G filter. In a typical test, the TiO2-coated glass with an area of 3.5 × 3.5 cm2 was placed at the bottom of the reactor. At the beginning, CO2 (99.9999%) was purged at 120 ml min−1 in the system through a water bubbler (50 °C) for 1 h to remove any impurity gases. Afterwards, the gas flow was reduced to 3.0 ml min−1 for the reaction. The light was turned on after the flow was stabilized. A gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A, USA) with two flame ionization detectors (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used for analysing the gaseous products. The control experiments in the dark, with N2 rather than CO2 and without a catalyst, were also conducted to verify that the products are evolved by photocatalytically reducing CO2. The reduced CO2 products presented in Fig. 5h represent the average values after a three-hour reaction.
Selective photodeposition of a noble metal and metal oxide
For noble metal deposition, the films on which clearly different dominant facets were grown (sample A101–001, A001–010, and A010) were cut to ∼0.5 × 0.5 cm2. All three films were soaked in 10 mM silver nitrate (AgNO3) at the same time, and then irradiated with simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G) to ensure that all films are photodeposited by Ag under identical conditions. Irradiation was allowed for 3 h, and then the films were gently rinsed with distilled water and dried in a vacuum oven set at 80 °C. Metal oxide deposition was performed in a similar procedure to noble metal deposition, except that a solution containing 10 mM manganese nitrate (Mn(NO3)2) and 20 mM sodium iodate (NaIO3) was used instead of 10 mM AgNO3.
Computational method
The Vienna ab initio simulation program (VASP)45,46 was applied to perform the periodic plane-wave DFT calculations. The calculations used the PBE functional47,48 with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the projector augmented-wave function (PAW)49,50 methods to imitate the non-valence core electrons. The pseudopotentials were used to model the semi-core p states of Ti atoms. It was suggested that the dispersion effect cannot be neglected for an accurate description of structural and energetic characteristics of TiO2.51 Thus, we included the long-range dispersion using the semiempirical dispersion potential corrected DFT-D3 method.52,53 The Gaussian broadening54 and a smearing width of 0.05 eV were employed. The applied plane-wave cutoff energy was 450 eV. The convergence criteria for electronic self-consistent iteration was set to 1 × 10−6 eV. The ionic relaxation loop convergence is set such that all forces are smaller than 0.02 eV Å−1. The bulk structure calculations employed 11 × 11 × 11 k-point Monkhorst–Pack mesh sampling and a 3 × 3 × 1 k-point mesh was employed for surface structure calculations. Adsorbates and all atoms are fully relaxed without any constraint. The results were checked for convergence with respect to the applied numbers of k-points and cutoff energy.
Structural models
Bulk structures of rutile and anatase TiO2 were firstly optimized. The calculated lattice parameters of anatase TiO2 are: a = 3.796 Å, b = 3.796 Å, c = 9.503 Å, and Ti–O(2X) bond length (d) = 1.988 Å. They are in very good agreement with the experimental values (a = 3.782 Å, b = 3.782 Å, c = 9.502 Å, and d = 1.979 Å).55 The calculated lattice parameters of rutile TiO2 also agree with the experimental values. The calculated values are: a = 4.611 Å, b = 4.611 Å, c = 2.956 Å, and Ti–O bond length (d) = 1.984 Å and the values obtained from the experiments are: a = 4.587 Å, b = 4.587 Å, c = 2.954 Å, and Ti–O bond length (d) = 1.976 Å.55 The slab model of a 2 × 2 supercell was employed for the anatase (001) surface with 3 atomic layers containing 81 atoms and for the anatase (101) surface with 6 atomic layers containing 96 atoms. A 3 × 3 supercell was employed for the rutile (110) surface with 5 atomic layers containing 108 atoms. A vacuum region of ∼20 Å is included in the z direction. The slab models are shown in the ESI S10.† All atoms are relaxed without any constraint.
The coverage (monolayer, ML) of F− is defined as the number of adsorbed F atoms (n) divided by the total number of Ti surface atoms. The coverage (monolayer, ML) of H+ is defined as the number of adsorbed H atoms (n) divided by the total number of O surface atoms. The number of Ti and O surface atoms in the surfaces of rutile TiO2 (110), and anatase TiO2 (001) and (101) is 9, 9 and 8 atoms, respectively.
Surface energy calculation
Surface energies, γ, were calculated using eqn (5). (5)where, Eslab is the total energy of the slab (with F/H atoms adsorbed), N is the total number of TiO2 units contained in the slab structural model, Ebulk TiO2 is the energy per unit of TiO2 in the bulk structure, Nadsorbate is the number of adsorbed H/F atoms, Eisolated molecule is the energy of isolated H2 and F2 molecules, and A is the surface area of a slab structural model. In the case of H and F adsorption, Eisolated molecule is 0.5 times the energy of isolated H2 and F2 molecules, respectively.
