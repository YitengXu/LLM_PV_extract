    , Accepted 30th September 2022First published on 3rd October 2022AbstractAqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) based on high-safety zinc metal anodes have advantages of low cost and high theoretical capacity and are considered as a promising large-scale energy storage system. Their practical application, however, is hampered by slow transport kinetics, low energy density, and poor cycling performance. In this work, we design and successfully synthesize ultrastable lattice water-rich VO2·xH2O materials by considering the fact that abundant crystallized water can act as “water lubrication”, and a charge shielding medium to weaken the electrostatic effect. As a result, VO2·xH2O as a cathode for AZIBs can provide a specific capacity of 376 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 1 A g−1 and no apparent capacity decay after 8000 cycles at 15 A g−1. The excellent zinc storage performance can be ascribed to the efficient kinetics and abundant reaction sites of the VO2·xH2O electrode. A series of in situ and ex situ characterizations indicate that it is the H+/Zn2+ co-intercalation mechanism to store zinc in the VO2·xH2O electrode. In short, the abundant crystallized water vanadium-based materials may be excellent candidates for advanced cathode materials of AZIBs.
1. Introduction
With the tremendous growth of the social economy, the demand for energy is rising, which needs renewable and clean energy sources, such as solar, geothermal, and wind power, as a supplement to traditional fossil fuels. Transmission and storage of energy determine the efficiency of clean energy consumption. The conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy is a versatile method for storing renewable energy during intermittent supply and large-scale delivery. There has been a lot of success with rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).1,2 These batteries have become the go-to option for many different electronic products. The disadvantages of limited lithium resources, high cost, and the flammability of electrolytes prevent widespread application of this technology, although it does have many applications.3 As an alternative, it is absolutely essential to develop innovative water-based metal-ion batteries (Na, K, and Zn) that are inexpensive safe, and environmentally friendly with good cycle performance.4–7 The aqueous zinc-ion battery (AZIBs) is a promising candidate because zinc metal has a high theoretical capacity (820 mA h g−1), low electrochemical potential (−0.763 V), sizeable natural abundance, and small hydrated ionic radius.8,9 These characteristics make zinc metal a promising candidate for hotspots. Furthermore, substituting the alkaline electrolyte with a pH-neutral (or slightly acidic) solution can eliminate the zinc dendrite problem in alkaline zinc batteries, lowering operating costs. After the anode and electrolyte difficulties are resolved, it is vital to develop cathode materials with high electrolyte stability but low electrostatic effect to optimize the electrochemical performance of AZIBs. However, this is a difficult task to accomplish. Prussian blue analogs, cobalt-based oxides, manganese-based oxides, vanadium-based oxides, and organic materials have all been used as cathodes in AZIBs in recent years.10
Compared with other cathode materials for AZIBs, vanadium-based cathodes with multivalent states and unique structures generally exhibit excellent electrochemical performance (higher reversible capacity, better rate capability, and longer cycle life). These characteristics make vanadium-based cathodes deserving further investigation. Vanadium-based cathodes include the layered or tunnel vanadium oxides, vanadates, VS2, and vanadium-based NASICON.11–14 The most common types of vanadium-based cathodes have been reported and significant progress has been made in the research on zinc ion diffusion channels, crystal structures, energy storage mechanisms, and battery performance of vanadium-based cathodes, but some key issues still exist, such as suboptimal reaction kinetics, complex and controversial storage mechanism, low voltage plateau and cycling stability, etc. Actually, the vanadium-based oxides are a promising candidate for AZIBs, like monoclinic VO2 with an open tunnel structure based on two-electron redox reactions.15–17 The tunnel-type cathodes possess special one-dimensional diffusion channels with high structural stability and sufficient storage sites for Zn ions, and generally exhibit a high voltage plateau and theoretical specific capacity (646 mA h g−1). Kinetics will be slowed down, irreversible phase formation and structural damage will occur due to the strong electrostatic interaction between divalent Zn2+ and the VO2 cathode.18–20 Crystalline water is pre-embedded in vanadium-based cathode materials, which can play an important role of “water lubrication” to stabilize the reversible intercalation/deintercalation structure, and therefore accelerate the rapid transport of zinc ions. Moreover, the crystal water can also act as a charge shielding medium, which can reduce the electrostatic interaction between the intercalated Zn2+ and the active material. This would lead to an improved kinetics for the transport of fast Zn2+ between the electrolyte and the electrodes.21–23
Based on the above analysis, herein, we propose a simple and scalable hydrothermal method to successfully design and synthesize metastable vanadium dioxide nanobelts (VO2·xH2O) with crystal water. To highlight the importance of polyacrylamide carbon source in synthesis process, we synthesized a comparative sample of (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O without using the polyacrylamide carbon source. Both VO2·xH2O and (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O were used as cathode materials for AZIBs. VO2·xH2O showed better electrochemical performance, which is mainly attributed to the network structure formed by the interweaving of nanobelts and the one-dimensional ultra-stable tunnel structure and facilitate the transport and storage of ions. A reversible capacity of 376 mA h g−1 was obtained in VO2·xH2O electrode after 200 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A g−1. Furthermore, at a current density of 5 A g−1, the reversible capacity can be as high as 289 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles. More importantly, even at a current density of 15 A g−1, this cathode can achieve excellent high-rate performance, with a discharge capacity of 206 mA h g−1 and a capacity retention rate of 105% after 8000 cycles. Furthermore, using a series of in situ and ex situ characterizations, the structural and morphological evolutions of VO2·xH2O nanobelt cathode during cycling were systematically investigated, and the energy storage mechanism was also revealed.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of VO2·xH2O and (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O composite
A straightforward hydrothermal method was used to synthesize VO2·xH2O. In a typical procedure, 1.2 g of NH4VO3 and 0.7 g of polyacrylamide were weighed, dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water, and stirred for 2 h at 80 °C to form a transparent, pale yellow colloid. 10 mL of 2 M HCl and 4 mL of 35% H2O2 were successfully added to the above solution, which was then stirred for 0.5 h at 80 °C to produce a dark red solution. The aforementioned solution was transferred to a 50 mL polytetrafluoroethylene reaction kettle and reacted for 12 h at 180 °C. The dark blue samples were obtained through two washes with deionized water and ethanol, followed by 15 h of vacuum drying at 70 °C. The synthesis of (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O is exactly the same as that of VO2·xH2O. The only difference is that 0.7 g of polyacrylamide was not added during the synthesis.
2.2 Materials characterizations
The as-prepared samples were analyzed using Power X-ray diffraction (PXRD, Rigaku D/max-2500V, Cu Kα radiation), Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Nicolet 380 FTIR spectrometer, 4000–400 cm−1 region, the thickness of the sample: ∼0.3 mm), and Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw in plus, excitation wavelength: 785 nm, excitation power: 3 mW, spot size: ∼1.2 μm) to determine the structure. Under air conditions, the Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) test was carried out on a Netzsch STA 449F5 instrument. The Brunner–Emmet–Teller (BET) surface areas and pore size distribution (BJH model) were measured by an accelerated surface area and porosimetry analyzer ASAP 2460 (Micromeritics Instrument Corp, analysis adsorptive: N2). In order to determine the surface compositions of the composites, an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) with the model number PHI ESCA-5000C was utilized. The patterns of the simulated PXRD were determined by the Reflex module. The refinement of the experimental PXRD of VO2·xH2O was conducted by GSAS to optimize the lattice parameters iteratively until the Rwp value converges. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI S-4700), and Transmission electron microscope (TEM) with scanning transmission electron microscopy (TFEI ECNAI G2 F20) were conducted on the as-prepared samples and ex situ electrodes to study their morphology and morphological changes. In ex situ SEM, TEM, and HRTEM, the electrodes contain 80% active material, 10% Super P, and 10% PVDF. Before conducting the experiments, the electrodes were prepared by first disassembling the cycled cells at various voltages, then washing them three times with water, and finally drying them at 60 °C for 12 h under a vacuum. The in situ XRD measurement was performed by the Bruker D8 Advanced instrument in the reflect mode with beryllium windows. The current collector was a Ti foil that was thinner than coin cells, and the interval term was set to 720 s for each 2θ scan. The electrodes that are used in in situ tests are the same as those that are used in ex situ SEM. The only difference is that the mass loading needs to be increased to at least 5 mg cm−2 and that the electrodes were assembled in specific test equipment in a manner that is just like the method used for coin cells.
2.3 Electrochemical measurement
CR2032 coin-type cells were used for the electrochemical measurements. In the fabrication of the working electrode, the active material, conductive carbon black (Super P), and PVDF were combined on titanium foil in a weight ratio of 8:1:1, and the mixture was allowed to dry at 60 °C for 12 h while under vacuum. The loading of the electrode materials on the titanium foil was approximately 1.5 mg cm−2 with the electrolyte volume of 40 μL mg−1 in every cell. A solution of 2 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 in water, glass fiber and zinc foil were used as the electrolyte, the separator, and the reference electrode, respectively. On the CHI760E electrochemical workstation, the CV test (with a scan rate ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1) and the EIS test (with a frequency range ranging from 105 to 0.01 Hz) were performed. A LAND-CT2001 test system was selected for the galvanostatic charge–discharge tests under varying current densities (voltage range: 0.2–1.6 V), and the Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT) measurements.
3. Results and discussion
VO2·xH2O nanobelts with crystal water was successfully designed and synthesized by a facile and easily scalable hydrothermal method, as shown in Fig. 1. The spontaneous nucleation and aggregation of nanoparticles are primarily responsible for the formation of nanobelt morphology, where nanoparticles have a tendency to grow into nanobelt, which in turn reduces the total surface energy of the system. Additionally, the reaction of carbon with NH4VO3 under H2O2 oxidation of polyacrylamide (NH4VO3 + C → NH3↑ + VO2 + CO2↑ + H2O↑) is primarily responsible for the formation of VO2.24 To highlight the importance of polyacrylamide carbon source, we also synthesized a comparison sample of (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O without adding the polyacrylamide carbon source during the synthesis. To investigate the difference in structure and morphology between VO2·xH2O and (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O samples generated by adding carbon source during synthesis, a series of characterizations were used, including power X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), Brunner–Emmet–Teller (BET), field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), high angle angular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), etc. The crystal structure of VO2·xH2O was analyzed by PXRD along with Rietveld refinement (Fig. 2a and Table S1†), denoting a monoclinic structure (space group C2/m(12)), and the lattice parameters are a = 6.296112 Å, b = 6.297671 Å, c = 6.427364 Å, α = 73.845°, β = 73.817°, γ = 34.114°, V = 136.732 Å3 with Rwp = 5.25%, Rp = 3.97%. The synthesis of (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O (JCPDS No. 26-0097) was verified by the PXRD pattern (Fig. S1†).25,26 Several typical diffraction characteristic peaks are located at 2θ = 8.578°, 16.402°, 25.879°, 26.267°, and 50.976° corresponding to the (001), (200), (003), (−111), and (021) crystal planes, respectively. Both (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O and VO2·xH2O have tunnel structures, while the (001) plane of (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O at a smaller angle indicates a larger lattice spacing, which may cause its structural instability.

Fig. 2b is the Raman spectrum of VO2·xH2O and (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O in the low frequency range (100–1100 cm−1). Three peaks at approximately 140, 281, and 404 cm−1 are consistent with monoclinic VO2.27 Among them, the peak at 140 cm−1 is closely related to the tunnel structure, while the peak at 281 cm−1 is associated with a VO bending vibration bond. High-resolution XPS characterization was performed to better analyze the elemental valence state of samples. The full spectrum of VO2·xH2O is shown in Fig. S2a,† indicating the presence of two elemental compositions of O and V in VO2·xH2O nanobelt. The XPS spectrum of V 2p in VO2·xH2O is dominated by two peaks, which are assigned to V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 2c). The peaks at 515.5 eV, 516.8 eV, 522.9 eV, 524.2 eV correspond to V4+2p3/2, V5+2p3/2, V4+2p1/2, and V5+2p1/2, respectively.28–30 The presence of V5+ in VO2·xH2O is mainly attributed to the high surface area of the material allowing partial interaction with oxygen upon atmospheric exposure. In addition, the presence of multivalent vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide can enhance the electrical conductivity of the material, thereby improving the electrochemical performance of the material.29 There are three typical peaks at 529.4, 531.6, and 532.8 eV in the XPS spectrum of O 1s, which can be assigned to V–O, –OH and low coordination oxygen ions, respectively (Fig. 2d).31 Furthermore, the XPS full spectrum of (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O shows that it is composed of three elements: N, O, and V. (Fig. S2b†). The V 2p XPS spectrum in (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O is split into two peaks at 515.8 and 517.1 eV, corresponding to V4+ and V5+, respectively (Fig. S3a†). In Fig. S3b and c,† the peaks located at 530.1/532.1 eV and 400.8 eV can be assigned to O 1s and N 1s in (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O.
Generally, the surface properties of the materials have some effects on the Zn storage kinetics of cathode materials. FTIR was employed to investigate the surface properties of the products. Fig. 2e and S4† depict the V–O, VO, and V–O–V vibrational peaks and crystal water peaks of VO2·xH2O and (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O samples, respectively.27 For (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O, however, N–H vibrational peaks were also detected at 1401 and 2975/3120 cm−1.26 Using TGA, the crystal water content of VO2·xH2O was determined (Fig. S5†). The total mass loss is due to the physical absorption of water (30–100 °C) and the evaporation of lattice water between 100 °C and 390 °C. On the basis of a weight loss of 7.1%, each VO2 is estimated to contain 0.35 crystal water.32 After 390 °C, a slight rise phenomenon can be seen, which can be attributed to the phase transition of the material when it is exposed to high temperature. This finding is in line with the observation from earlier literature. Fig. 2f depicts the specific surface area and pore size distribution of VO2·xH2O. It has a large specific surface area (52.7 cm2 g−1) and a mesoporous structure, which increases the contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte and facilitates large ionic radius zinc ion transport.
The SEM, TEM, and HRTEM characterization were used to investigate the effect of polyacrylamide carbon source addition on the morphology and microstructure of the synthesized VO2·xH2O and (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O. (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O exhibits a nanobelt structure with cross-linked and unclear outline, while VO2·xH2O exhibits a nanobelt structure of 10–30 nm (Fig. 3a–h and S6†). The well-defined nanobelt of VO2·xH2O can be interwoven to form a stable nano-network structure, which is beneficial to the transport and storage of zinc ions. Furthermore, the lattice spacing of 0.62 nm can be clearly observed in Fig. 3i and S7,† which can be attributed to the (001) plane of the VO2 crystal. The HAADF-STEM elemental mapping images of VO2·xH2O (Fig. 3j–l) indicate the presence and uniform distribution of oxygen and vanadium elements. Moreover, the HAADF-STEM elemental mapping image of (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O can not only observe the existence of oxygen and vanadium, but also the existence of nitrogen (Fig. S8†).

The electrochemical performances of VO2·xH2O and (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O were measured by using CR-2032 coin-type cells. These cells utilized a zinc anode, a 2 M aqueous Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte, and a glass fiber separator. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic discharge–charge tests were performed to explore the electrochemical behavior of VO2·xH2O and (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O during zinc storage. The first three CV curves of VO2·xH2O as the cathode for AZIBs are shown in Fig. 4a. During the first cycle of charge–discharge, the peaks at 0.51 V and 0.58/1.05 V are mainly attributed to the Zn2+ intercalation/extraction process, which is consistent with the plateau of the charge–discharge curve (Fig. 4b).33,34 In the next two cycles, the two pairs of reduction/oxidation peaks located at 0.57/0.92 V and 0.68/1.07 V almost overlap, indicating the good reversibility of the VO2·xH2O electrode. However, the positions of the redox peaks for the first cycle and the following two cycles are significantly different, indicating that there is an irreversible reaction in the first cycle. The VO2·xH2O cathode delivered a high discharge/charge capacity of 302/373 mA h g−1 in the first cycle at a current density of 1 A g−1, with a corresponding coulombic efficiency of 81.0% (Fig. 4b). During the following two cycles of charge and discharge, the discharge/charge capacities are as high as 360/370 mA h g−1 and 367/373 mA h g−1, respectively, and their corresponding coulombic efficiencies are also improved to 97.3% and 98.4%. This indicates the excellent reversibility of the insertion/extraction process of Zn2+, which is attributed to the unique structure of VO2·xH2O cathode. Similarly, two pairs of peaks appear at 0.52/0.87 V and 0.73/1.09 V in the CV curve of (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O electrode (Fig. S9a†).26 The charge–discharge curves of the (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O electrode at a current density of 1 A g−1 for the first three cycles are shown in Fig. S9b.† However, the discharge/charge capacity of the first cycle is only 221/244 mA h g−1.

(c and d) Cycling performance of (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O and VO2·xH2O at the current densities of 1 and 5 A g−1, respectively. (e) Rate capability of (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O and VO2·xH2O at different current densities. (f) Long-term cycling performance of VO2·xH2O at the current densities 15 A g−1. 
The cycling diagrams of VO2·xH2O and (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O electrodes at a current density of 1.0 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 4c. The capacity of VO2·xH2O electrode increases significantly in the first 35 cycles due to improved diffusion kinetics and better electrolyte injection during repeated cycling. The VO2·xH2O electrode can achieve ultra-high capacitances of 448 and 376 mA h g−1 after 35 and 200 cycles, respectively, and the coulombic efficiency is close to 100%. The (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O electrode only had a charge capacity of 134 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles. Besides, the obtained VO2·xH2O and (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O electrodes maintained charge capacities of 289 mA h g−1 and 100 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles at 5 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 4d). Additionally, it was found that the (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O electrode presents a noticeable capacity decrease throughout the cycle test, which is mostly attributable to the structural instability due to the larger lattice spacing of the electrode. Overall, VO2·xH2O exhibits much superior electrochemical performance than (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O, which is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of the VO2·xH2O stabilized nanobelt structure, crystal water, and unique pore structure. The rate capabilities of VO2·xH2O and (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O electrodes were presented in Fig. 4e, where the VO2·xH2O electrode maintained charge capacities of 429, 390, 355, 330, and 304 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0 A g−1, respectively. When the current density was restored to 0.5 A g−1, the capacity was 452 mA h g−1, highlighting the excellent rate capability of the electrode with VO2·xH2O nanobelt structure. In the same test conditions, the rate performance of (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O is obviously inferior to that of VO2·xH2O electrode. The (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O electrode has only a charge capacity of 117 mA h g−1 at a current density of 15 A g−1. Besides, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) value of VO2·xH2O electrode is also lower than that of (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O after the first cycle, which further confirms that VO2·xH2O has excellent zinc storage kinetics (Fig. S10†). It is worth noting that the VO2·xH2O electrode has a capacity retention rate of 105% under the ultra-long cycle test of 8000 cycles at a high current density of 15 A g−1. Compared to previously reported VO2-based materials for AZIBs, the VO2·xH2O electrode in this study exhibits excellent Zn-storage performance including high capacity and long cycle life (Table S2†). The synergistic effect of ultra-stable nanobelt structure and crystal water is primarily responsible for the outstanding electrochemical performance of VO2·xH2O electrode. In addition, structural water in VO2·xH2O is also important for the kinetics of Zn2+ insertion, because it reduces the effective charge of Zn2+ and the electrostatic interaction between layers. The structural water acts as a “lubricant” for allowing Zn2+ to diffuse more easily and therefore improves electrochemical performance.
The CV at different scan rates and Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT) were used to further investigate the kinetics of zinc storage at the VO2·xH2O electrode. When the scan rate was increased from 0.2 mV s−1 to 1.0 mV s−1, the shape of the CV curves remained similar, but the characteristic redox peak width increased and shifted slightly (Fig. 5a). In general, the relationship between the peak current (i) of the CV curve and the scan rate (v) can be expressed as i = avb, where a and b are adjustable parameters.35–37 The b value is generally between 0.5 and 1.0, reflecting the mode of the electrochemical process. For a diffusion-controlled process, b = 0.5, whereas b is 1.0 for a capacitively-controlled process. From the log(i) and log(v) curves of the characteristic peaks, the b values of the four peaks are 0.77, 0.80, 0.73 and 0.81, respectively, indicating that the VO2·xH2O electrode is controlled by both diffusion and capacitance (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, the (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O electrode was tested at various scan rates by CV measurements. The b values of the two characteristic peaks were calculated to be 0.49 and 0.59, indicating that the process is primarily controlled by diffusion (Fig. S11†). Besides, the current response can be divided into diffusion control and capacitive contribution: i = k1v + k2v1/2. Fig. 5c and d show the capacitance contributions of VO2·xH2O electrode at 0.2 mV s−1 to 1.0 mV s−1 is 48.8%, 55.7%, 60.8%, 64.9%, 67.9%, respectively. The gradual increase in capacitive contribution with increasing scan rate demonstrates that the electrochemical behavior of the VO2·xH2O electrode is dominated by the capacitive effect, which will contribute to the high rate performance of VO2·xH2O.38 The results show that the capacitive contribution increases gradually with the scan rate, which can be attributed to the suppression of the zinc ion diffusion process at high rates. Meanwhile, the GITT test can be used to calculate the diffusion coefficient of Zn ions during the zinc storage process of VO2·xH2O and (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O electrodes. GITT data was collected in the discharge/charge state for 15 minutes and the rest state for 60 minutes (Fig. 5e and S12a†). The calculated results of the zinc ion diffusion coefficient are shown in Fig. 5e, f and S12b.† During the first cycle of charge and discharge, VO2·xH2O (10−10.8–10−10.3 cm2 s−1) exhibits a higher Zn2+ diffusion coefficient than (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O (10−11.7–10−10.8 cm2 s−1), which further explains why VO2·xH2O has better zinc storage performance.39–41 In addition, the high diffusion coefficient suggests that the electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and the host material is weak. To gain a better understanding of the kinetic behavior, the in situ EIS tests of the VO2·xH2O electrode were performed during the first discharge–charge cycle (Fig. 5g). In the first full cycle, there is no discernible change in the slope line part under various voltages, indicating the Warburg diffusion characteristics of the VO2·xH2O electrode.36 Compared to the initial state, the impedance is significantly reduced in the subsequent discharge and charge process, indicating gradual activation of the VO2·xH2O electrode.42

To better comprehend the Zn storage mechanism of the VO2·xH2O electrode, the crystal structure evolution during the intercalation/deintercalation of Zn ions was investigated using in situ XRD. Fig. 6a–d depicts full and enlarged colormap 3D waterfall plots with the projection of in situ XRD of the VO2·xH2O electrode during the first three cycles, and Fig. 6e depicts the corresponding in situ XRD patterns. The (001), (200), (110), (−202), (002), (401), (312), (601), and (022) planes can be assigned to the diffraction peaks of VO2·xH2O at 2θ = 14.4°, 15.3°, 25.3°, 28.7°, 29.0°, 38.3°, 49.5°, 53.9°, and 58.4°, respectively.43 These diffraction peaks gradually shifted to the low-angle side during the discharge process, indicating that the lattice framework expanded. The obvious characteristic peak of VO2·xH2O at 2θ = 14.4° shifted to 14.1°, and the lattice spacing increases, owing to the intercalation of Zn2+ into the material structure and a reduction in electrostatic bond strength. The diffraction peaks of VO2·xH2O undergo the opposite process during the subsequent charging process. Furthermore, two new peaks at 13° and 19° for the VO2·xH2O electrode can be seen in the discharge process, which are well-matched with the phase of pure Znx(CF3SO3)y(OH)2x−y·nH2O.27 During subsequent charging, however, the two peaks gradually faded away. Meanwhile, during the following two cycles, a similar situation can be observed, indicating that the by-product undergoes a reversible reaction during the cycle, which is consistent with previous reports.44–47 It can be seen from the in situ XRD test results of the VO2·xH2O electrode that its zinc storage process is based on the proton (H+) and Zn2+ co-intercalation/de-intercalation process. Fig. 6f shows a schematic diagram of the reaction pathway of H+ and Zn2+ cooperating with the monoclinic structure VO2·xH2O. H+ and Zn2+ will synergistically intercalate into the host structure of VO2·xH2O in the discharge process, and an increase in OH− concentration in the electrolyte will result in the formation of Znx(CF3SO3)y(OH)2x−y·nH2O. In the charging process, the extraction of H+ and Zn2+ from the host structure of VO2·xH2O into the electrolyte results in the decomposition of by-products. To better understand the zinc storage mechanism of VO2·xH2O, we performed a series of ex situ characterizations in fully discharged and charged states. The SEM (Fig. S13†) and TEM (Fig. 6g and k) were used to characterize the morphological characteristics of the VO2·xH2O electrode in the fully discharged and fully charged states of the first circle. The VO2·xH2O nanobelt structure can be seen to be intact, indicating that it has a stable structure. Due to the co-intercalation of H+/Zn2+, the lattice spacing of the (001) plane of VO2·xH2O increases from 0.62 to 0.64 nm after the first discharge to 0.2 V (Fig. 6h and i).24 Furthermore, the HAADF-STEM image reveals that in the fully discharged state, the Zn element is uniformly dispersed in VO2·xH2O (Fig. 6j). The lattice spacing of the (0 0 1) plane of VO2·xH2O shrinks back to its original state after charging to 1.6 V (Fig. 6l and m), indicating that the structural change is reversible. Fig. 6n shows that the Zn element in the fully charged VO2·xH2O electrode is significantly reduced.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we successfully prepared monoclinic VO2·xH2O nanobelt using a simple hydrothermal method. VO2·xH2O can be used directly as the cathode material for AZIBs. The ultrastable VO2·xH2O containing crystal water can act as a lubricant and can also weaken the electrostatic interaction between the intercalated cations and the active material and enhance the kinetics of ion transport between the electrolyte and the electrode. As a result, the VO2·xH2O cathode has a high capacity (376 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 1 A g−1), a long cycle stability (105% capacity retention rate after 8000 cycles at an ultra-high current density of 15 A g−1), and a high rate performance (289 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles at 5 A g−1). In situ XRD and a series of ex situ characterization tests revealed that VO2·xH2O presented the H+/Zn2+ synergistic storage mechanism. Meanwhile, the cycle is accompanied by the reversible formation/decomposition of by-products. Therefore, our work provides an efficient and straightforward synthetic method for producing monoclinic-type VO2·xH2O cathodes for AZIBs, which will be useful for the development of high-performance AZIBs.
