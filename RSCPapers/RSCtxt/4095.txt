    , Accepted 22nd December 2005First published on 12th January 2006AbstractPulsed laser photolysis combined with transient absorption spectroscopy and resonance fluorescence was used to examine the photolysis of OIO at a number of wavelengths corresponding to absorption bands in its visible spectrum between ≈530 and 570 nm. Photolysis at 532 nm was found to result in substantial depopulation of the absorbing ground state, enabling an estimate for the absorption cross section of OIO at 610.2 nm of (6 ± 2) × 10−18 cm2 molecule−1 to be obtained. No evidence was found for I atom formation following photolysis of OIO at 532, 562.3, 567.9 and 573.8 nm, enabling an upper limit to the I atom quantum yield of <0.05 (560–580 nm) and <0.24 (532 nm) to be established.
1. Introduction
Halogen oxides have been recognised as important reactive atmospheric trace gases for several decades, and have a strong impact on the ozone chemistry of the stratosphere e.g.1–4 and the mid-latitude and polar troposphere5–8 although the role of iodine oxide appears at present to be mainly restricted to the marine boundary layer9,10 where it takes part in ozone destroying cycles.6,11–13 An iodine oxide that has only recently received attention is OIO, which was first observed in laboratory studies of the reactions of IO with itself, reaction (R1)14–17 and with BrO, reaction (R2)15,18 and also in field experiments.19 In reactions (R1) and (R2), OIO is formed in yields of ≈40% and ≈80%, respectively.15,20,21 The reaction channels which are usually considered to be significant are listed below: IO + IO → OIO + I(R1a) IO + IO → 2 I + O2(R1b) IO + IO + M → I2O2 + M(R1c) IO + BrO → OIO + Br(R2a) IO + BrO → I + Br + O2(R2b)In the atmosphere, the reaction of the halogen atom with O3 is responsible for formation of IO and BrO (reactions (R3) and (R4)), and the combination of (R3) with (R1), or (R4) with (R2) results in chemical cycles that destroy ozone. I + O3
						→ IO + O2(R3) Br + O3
						→ BrO + O2(R4)The efficiency with which ozone is destroyed depends on the relative rates of formation of I atoms in the reaction pathways listed above. For example, maximum ozone destruction in reaction (R1) is achieved if channel (R1b) is dominant (both I atoms released) whereas formation of OIO in (R1a) represents a partial chain terminating step if OIO is stable with respect to formation of I and O2. As OIO is known to possess a strong absorption spectrum between ≈450 and 600 nm,14 the possibility that, similar to its chlorine analogue OClO, OIO can be removed by photolysis in the atmosphere needs to be considered: OIO + hν (460–620 nm) → O(3P) + IO(R5a) OIO + hν (460–620 nm) → I(2PJ) + O2(R5b)In addition, OIO has been implicated in the formation of new particles in the marine boundary layer,22–24 which may proceed via formation of I2O4 in a self reaction of OIO. The efficiency of this process will depend sensitively on the concentration of OIO, which in turn may be influenced by its dissociation by sunlight.
In a previous study from this group, we were able to show that the photolysis of OIO to form O(3P) was inefficient at 532 nm, with a measured upper limit to the quantum yield, ΦO532(OIO), of 7 × 10−3.16 This result is consistent with quantum chemical calculations of the bond-dissociation energy of OIO, which indicate that formation of O(3P) is thermodynamically unfeasible in a single photon process at this wavelength.25 In the same study, by monitoring I(2PJ), Ingham et al.16 derived an upper limit of 0.15 for the single photon quantum yield of I atom formation, ΦI532(OIO) = 0.15. We note that for formation of ground state I atoms, I (2P3/2), this process is thermodynamically feasible at wavelengths as long as ≈4000 nm.
Together, these results are not in accord with recent, high resolution spectroscopic studies of OIO which provide evidence of predissociation, or with its apparent lack of observable fluorescence.26 In order to try to clarify this situation, we have conducted further experiments on the photolysis of OIO. The experimental set up has been modified to generate higher concentrations of OIO and to allow detection of I atom formation following OIO photolysis at a number of wavelengths using a tuneable dye laser as well as at the same 532 nm Nd-YAG laser as previously. We also monitor loss of OIO following absorption of a 532 nm photon, which can provide e.g. the overall quantum yield of dissociation at this wavelength.
2. Experimental
Several aspects of the experimental set up were described in our previous publication,16 new features are described below and displayed schematically in Fig. 1. The central component of the experimental set up is a Pyrex tube (id = 4 cm) of either 44 cm or 130 cm length, which serves as reaction vessel. Quartz end-windows were used to transmit light from the xenon lamp and the lasers. A small flow of gas purged the insides of these windows to prevent built up of solid deposits (often encountered in photochemical studies involving iodine oxides) which otherwise caused slight drifts in the transmitted light intensity. The lasers were coupled into the reaction cell via dielectric mirrors which were transmissive at the analysis light wavelengths (see caption to Fig. 1 for details). The analysis light was provided by a 75 W, high pressure xenon lamp, which was collimated, passed through a high-pass cut-off filter (400 or 500 nm) and apertured down to ≈5 mm before being directed (counter propagating to the lasers) on the main axis through the cell. The transmitted light was focussed onto the entrance slit of a 50 cm monochromator equipped with a 1200 line mm−1 grating and a photomultiplier tube (PMT 1). This set-up was used for the detection of transient absorption signals at discrete, selected wavelengths. As IO and OIO have structured absorption spectra between ≈400 and 580 nm, it was important to make sure that the monochromator could accurately and reproducibly scan to the required wavelength in this range. The calibration of the monochromator was therefore regularly checked by using the lines of a low pressure Hg Penray-lamp at e.g. 435.8, 507.3 (second order reflection of the 253.65 line) and 546.07 nm. Alternatively, by shifting the moveable mirror (MM), the light was directed to a 25 cm monochromator, equipped with a 600 line mm−1 grating which allowed simultaneous detection of a ≈160 nm range of wavelengths (usually 360–520 nm) by a linear array of diodes. In this configuration, the concentrations of stable species flowing through the cell (e.g. I2) could be monitored. Fig. 2 shows the spectra of the iodine species monitored in this study by absorption spectroscopy. The spectra of IO and OIO were taken from the studies of Bloss et al.15 and Gómez-Martín et al.,17 respectively, and were normalised to cross sections as indicated in the caption. Note that the Bloss et al. spectrum of IO was preferred to other available spectra, as it correctly reproduces the near-zero absorption between the vibronic bands at wavelengths greater than 425 nm, which we also observe.27

The single wavelength data points for the OIO spectrum were taken from the present study at 610.2 nm, Bloss et al.15 and Gómez-Martín et al.17 at ≈549 nm, and Joseph et al.37 at ≈568 nm. 
The I2 spectrum (0.1 nm resolution) was taken from the recent study of Saiz-Lopez et al.,28 which was normalised to the 500 nm cross section of Tellinghuisen.29 We have previously confirmed that the cross sections of Tellinghuisen in the continuum at wavelengths less than 500 nm are accurate.30
Pulsed photolysis at 193 or 248 nm (pulse width ≈20 ns) was provided by an excimer laser (Lambda-Physik LPX/Novatube). The frequency doubled, 532 nm pulsed emission from a Nd-YAG (Quantel-Brilliant B, pulse width 6 ns) was either directed directly into the reaction vessel via a set of expanding optics to increase beam diameter to ≈1.5 cm, or was used to pump a dye laser operating with Rhodamine 6G (560–575 nm). Careful alignment along the central axis of the cell ensured that the volume swept out by the laser light completely encompassed that of the analysis light. Detection of fluorescent emission was achieved by two photomultiplier tubes (PMT2 and PMT3) located at the upstream end of the flow tube. A solar blind PMT (PMT2) was used to detect emission from I atoms that was excited by using a microwave powered resonance lamp (normal to the major cell axis and the PMTs) through which a mixture of I2 highly diluted in He and Ar was flowed at ≈1–3 Torr total pressure as described previously.31 The resonance lamp output was transmitted into the cell via a quartz lens of 5 cm focal length, which served to mildly collimate the emission and filter out shorter wavelength emissions due to H, N and O atoms.
A third PMT (PMT3) was located as shown in Fig. 1, and used to monitor laser induced fluorescence (excited in this case at 532 nm by the Nd-YAG laser). This PMT was screened by a 560 nm long-pass filter to minimise laser stray light. Whilst detecting I atoms, we ensured that sufficient O2 was present (typically 3–4 Torr) in the reaction vessel so that any metastable I(2P1/2) atoms formed were rapidly quenched to the ground state I(2P3/2). The lifetime of I(2P1/2), <3 μs, was calculated from the quenching rate constant32 with O2 of ≈3 × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 and the O2 pressure. I(2P1/2 ) + O2
						→ I(2P3/2) + O2(R6)With this set-up, all I atoms, I(2PJ) were thus detected as I(2P3/2).
Typical flow rates in the cell were 5–6 L (stp) min−1 so that the contents of the reaction vessel were replaced between laser pulses (typically at ≈1 Hz) during measurement of transient absorption along the cell length. For the resonance fluorescence experiments, the laser repetition rate could be increased to ≈5 Hz, as only the volume of the cell upstream of the RF port needed to be replenished between pulses.
For the transient absorption experiments, the PMT1 signal was amplified and transferred via a low-pass filter (response time ≈10 μs) to a digital oscilloscope for averaging, before transfer to a PC for storage and analysis. Typically, 32 or 64 IO profiles and 256 or 512 OIO profiles were averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The signal from the resonance fluorescence photomultiplier was amplified before being digitised and counted using a multichannel scaler. Typically 1000 laser pulses were averaged with dwell times of 5 μs per channel.
Signals from the laser induced fluorescence PMT (PMT 3), were delivered directly to the 50 Ohm input of the digital storage oscilloscope, where they were averaged over 16–128 laser pulses.
2.1. Materials
Ozone was prepared using a commercial ozoniser, and was stored on silica-gel at 195 K. It was admitted to the cell by passing a regulated flow of N2 or He through the silica gel at this temperature. Flows of I2 or CH2I2 were generated by passing N2 or He through a U-tube containing I2 crystals or a bubbler containing CH2I2 at ambient temperature. CF3I was added directly via a flow controller. The stated purity of the chemicals used were: I2 (99.8%, Aldrich), CF3I (99%, Aldrich), CH2I2 (99%, Aldrich), N2O (Messer Griessheim, 99%), He (99.996%, Linde), N2 and O2 (99.996%, Linde). I2 was re-distilled prior to use, N2O, CF3I and CH2I2 were used without further purification.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Generation of OIO
The first hurdle to overcome when conducting studies of OIO photochemistry, is the generation of this reactive species at a sufficient concentration. We used Schemes 1–4 which mainly relied on the IO self-reaction
 Scheme 1  248 nm Photolysis of O3 in the presence of I2. The O3 concentration was varied between 5–10 × 1014 molecule cm−3 and that of I2 between 5–10 × 1014 molecule cm−3. A 248 nm laser fluence of ≈30–35 mJ cm−2 was sufficient to generate ≈1 × 1014 IO cm−3. Higher concentrations of O3 were avoided to prevent excessive attenuation of the laser light and the resulting gradients in radical concentrations. 
 Scheme 2  248 nm Photolysis of O3/CH2I2. In this case, both CH2I2 and O3 were dissociated and the relative contribution to IO formation from reactions (R3) and (R11) was controlled by the concentrations and 248 nm absorption cross sections of CH2I2 (6–8 × 1014 molecule cm−3, σ248 = 1.57 × 10−18 cm2 molecule−133) and O3 (5–9 × 1014 molecule cm−3, σ248 = 1.07 × 10−17 cm2 molecule−1.34), though O3 photolysis was generally dominant. 
 Scheme 3  193 nm Photolysis of N2O in the presence of CF3I. Typical concentrations of N2O and CF3I were 3 × 1017 molecule cm−3 and 9 × 1015 molecule cm−3, respectively. Due to its relatively small absorption cross section at 193 nm (8.95 × 10−20 cm2 molecule−135) high concentrations of N2O were used to generate sufficient IO. For this reason, all experiments were carried out in N2 bath gas to minimise the reaction of O(1D) with N2O. 
 Scheme 4  193 nm Photolysis of O3 in the presence of CF3I. This scheme, used in experiments to detection I photofragments from OIO photolysis, utilises the fact that O3 absorbs relatively weakly at 193 nm (σ193nm = 4.36 × 10−19 cm2 molecule−134) to enable the use of high concentrations, which result in efficient recycling of I atoms formed in the IO self reaction, and thus maximising the OIO yield. It also suppresses the background I atom concentration, which was important in experiments where I atoms were detected directly. The yield of IO in reaction (R13) has been shown to be about 0.9. 27,36 Experiments using this IO generation scheme were carried out in N2 bath gas at pressures generally close to 70 Torr, with a few Torr of O2 added. The O3 concentration was generally 1–3 × 1016 molecule cm−3, with CF3I present at ≈7–11 × 1015 molecule cm−3. 
In addition, a few exploratory experiments were carried out using the simultaneous 193 nm photolysis of O3 and CHBr3 in the presence of CF3I, which resulted in OIO formation mainly viareaction (R2) of IO (formed in (R13)) and BrO (formed in reaction (R4)). As the amount of OIO obtained with this source was not significantly larger than use of the IO self reaction, this was not pursued further.
As an example of the datasets obtained, Fig. 3 displays an IO profile (obtained at 427.2 nm) and two OIO profiles (obtained at 549.1 and 532 nm) which were obtained back-to-back, i.e. separated in time by ≈10 min. In a chemically stable system, the relative strength of the OIO absorption at 532 and 549.1 nm reflects the cross section at these two wavelengths (see Fig. 2). As is apparent from Fig. 3 we are able to generate reasonably large concentrations of both IO and OIO. The maximum IO concentration in this example can be calculated from its maximum optical density (OD ≈ 0.1 at t = 2.5 ms after the laser pulse), its cross section, σ, at this wavelength (3.55 × 10−17 molecules cm−3)27 and the optical path length (l) according to Beer’s law (OD = σl[c]) as ≈2 × 1013 molecule cm−3.
 Fig. 3  Transient absorption due to IO at 427.2 nm and OIO at 532 nm and 549.1 nm following the pulsed photolysis at 193 nm of mixture of O3/CF3I/N2/O2 at 70 Torr. 
As has been previously observed15,16,37 OIO is a short lived transient and has reacted almost to zero within ≈1–2 ms of the laser pulse. The loss processes are presently unknown but may involve several reactive species present, including O(3P), IO, I2O2, I and OIO itself. For the purpose of the present experiments, this simply constrains the time frame in which experiments on its photodissociation can be conducted.
The assignment of the transient absorption at these wavelengths to IO and more importantly, OIO was confirmed by back-to-back experiments in which the detection wavelength was shifted to adjacent minima in the absorption spectra. In the present example this was at 434 nm for IO and 535 nm for OIO.
Off-peak measurements were also useful in identifying and eliminating laser induced offsets (electronic and window/filter effects), which were manifest as time independent signal changes just after the excimer laser pulse, and which were typically equivalent to changes in OD of 5 × 10−3. All the transient absorptions displayed or used to evaluate quantum yields have been corrected for such effects.
3.2. Photolysis at 532 nm, detection of OIO depletion
In these experiments, we monitored the loss of OIO following absorption of a photon at 532 nm. Usually OIO was detected at 610.2 nm as this wavelength is sufficiently isolated from the photolysis wavelength that optical interference can be reduced and also because the dielectric mirrors (DM1) are transparent above ≈600 nm, but highly reflective between 500 and 570 nm. In addition, OIO has similar absorption cross sections at 532 nm and 610.2 nm with σOIO532/σOIO610.2 = 1.3.17 This relative cross section is used to convert the measured optical density at the monitoring wavelength (610.2 nm) to that at the laser wavelength (532 nm). The laser fluence was varied between about 11 and 75 mJ cm−2 so that detectable depletions in OIO were observed.
In a typical experiment, the following procedure was adopted: first, a known amount of I2 (≈1014 molecules cm−3) was admitted to the flowing system (N2 bath gas only) and was monitored at 480 nm or 500 nm during a photolysis experiment at a certain laser fluence. The measurement of δI2 (the instantaneous change in I2 concentration caused by the laser pulse) provides the necessary data to calculate the effective laser fluence at the photolysis wavelength (see below). Use of in situ chemical actinometry to derive the laser fluence was preferred to use of a calibrated joulemeter, as the former does not need correction for beam profile and divergence, imperfect overlap between the laser beam and the analysis light beams or window transmission, and thus provides an “effective”, in situ laser fluence.
A typical experimental trace is given in Fig. 4A, which demonstrates that I2 is dissociated promptly, as expected. From the change in optical density at 480 nm measured before and after the laser pulse we calculated the change in the I2 concentration. Control experiments showed that the change in I2 varied linearly with the joulemeter reading of laser fluence over the range covered.
 Fig. 4  Upper panel (A): Depletion of I2 and OIO following photolysis at 532 nm. The I2 measurement serves to derive the effective, in situ laser fluence as described in the text. Lower panel (B): Expanded view of OIO profile with numerical simulations. 
From the measured change in optical density of I2, , we calculate the effective laser fluence (I0, in photon cm−2) from eqn (i), which is derived from the Beer–Lambert law, and the usual definition of the dimensionless quantum yield, Φoverallλ, as the ratio number of molecules dissociated, divided by the number of photons absorbed, (i)where  is the optical density of I2 at the laser wavelength, 532 nm, normalised for 1 cm pathlength,  is the cross section of I2 at 480 nm (1.25 × 10−18 cm2 molecule−1),29Φoverall532(I2) is the quantum yield of I2 dissociation (unity) and l is the absorption path length (44 cm). Note that, in order to calculate the optical density of I2 at 532 nm, we require its cross section at the laser wavelength. As the visible bands of I2 have fine rotational structure at high resolution38 and our photolysis laser has a linewidth of ≈1.4 cm−1 we did not use an available low resolution spectrum to read-off the cross section at 532 nm, but used the YAG laser at considerably reduced power as analysis light source. The cross section at 532 nm was thus obtained relative to the cross section at 500 nm in separate experiments using flowing mixtures of I2 in N2 in which the optical absorption at 500 was determined by the monochromator/xenon lamp set up, whereas that at 532 nm was measured using the Nd-YAG laser at reduced power and a joule-meter as detector. A linear relationship between optical density at 500 nm and at 532 nm (Fig. 5) enabled a relative cross section of σ(532 nm)/σ(500 nm) = (0.9 ± 0.15) to be derived. Using the 500 nm cross section of Tellinghuisen,29 as reference, we determined the effective cross section at 532 nm as (2.0 ± 0.2) × 10−18 cm2 molecule−1 which is displayed in Fig. 2. We note that this method of calculation of the laser fluence relies not only on knowing the cross section of I2 at the laser wavelength of 532 nm, but also assumes that the quantum yield of dissociation of I2 is unity.
 Fig. 5  Plot of optical density due to a flowing mixture of I2 in N2 at 500 nm (measured by diode array) versus optical density of the same gas mixture at the nominal laser wavelength of 532 nm as determined by change in transmitted laser intensity as I2 was admitted to the cell. The slope, 0.9 ± 0.15, gives the relative cross section of I2 at 532 nm compared to 500 nm. 
At low pressures and at visible wavelengths, I2 dissociates via predissociation of its B 3Π+0u excited state into one ground state I atom (2P3/2) and one metastable I atom (2P1/2) as well as via
					Π1u repulsive states with quantum yields that are wavelength dependent (i.e. excited state vibrational quantum number dependent) and which vary between unity and <0.2.39–41 I2 + hν (532 nm) → I2*(R15)At higher bath gas pressures (e.g. of N2, H2 or Ar) excited I2 dissociates via collisional energy transfer: I2* + M → 2 I + M(R16)The rate constant for collisional, dissociative quenching of I2* by N2 bath gas following excitation at wavelengths close to 530 nm is ≈2 × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1.39 At a bath gas pressure of 70 Torr N2, dissociation therefore takes place over a ≈20 ns time scale so that the dissociation quantum yield can be considered to be close to unity.42 This could be confirmed by conducting experiments in which the laser induced depletion of I2 was investigated at a series of pressures between 28 and 200 Torr. No significant dependence on pressure was observed within the experimental uncertainty (≈10%) supporting the conclusion that a quantum yield of unity is appropriate for all the experiments reported here.
Once the effective laser fluence was established, an IO precursor mixture according to any one of Schemes 1–4 was introduced into the cell, and photolysed to generate IO. Fig. 4A displays data that were obtained using Scheme 4, with the IO and OIO profiles monitored at 427 nm and 610.2 nm, respectively.
The 532 nm laser was triggered close to the maximum of the OIO profile, in this case at 0.5 ms. Similar to I2, OIO also shows prompt depletion following the laser pulse, whereby “prompt” implies within the time step of our analysis (≈10 μs). Whereas I2 recovers only rather slowly after the laser pulse, presumably due to recombination of I atoms and diffusion of I2 into the analysis light, the OIO profile shows more rapid recovery. In some experiments the recovery was sufficiently rapid that, within about 0.2–0.4 ms, the OIO profile was realigned with the trace obtained without 532 nm photolysis.
A potential explanation for this behaviour is the chemical reformation of OIO following dissociation to either O(3P) + IO or I + O2. The former can be ruled out as O(3P) formation has been shown to be insignificant (see Section 1.0) and also because the generation of IO would cause a significant perturbation to the IO profile, which was not observed. The formation of I atoms could however lead to OIO reformation viareactions (R3) and (R1) in those systems where O3 was present. In order to test this hypothesis, we numerically simulated the reaction system using Facsimile.43 The IO profile was first simulated using the measured concentrations of reactants with the excimer laser fluence adjusted to match the observed IO concentration. Following this, the OIO profile was simulated using the known IO self-reaction kinetics and branching ratio to OIO (R1), and various loss processes of OIO. As the loss processes for OIO are not well established, no attempt was made to find a consistent set of reactions to reproduce all OIO profiles, but the focus was on obtaining the correct balance between the formation and loss rates so as to reproduce the experimental OIO profile. This generally required a number of reactions of OIO (e.g. with itself) with rate coefficients close to collisional (i.e. > 10−10 cm3 molecule−1 s−1). This will be subject of a manuscript on the IO self reaction, and is not discussed further at this point.
Once the IO and OIO profiles were satisfactorily reproduced, a 532 nm laser pulse was simulated by adding an adjustable number of photons so that OIO was promptly depleted (to form I + O2) by an amount commensurate with the observation. The results of such a simulation are displayed as the lower solid line in Fig. 4B, which clearly does not reproduce the observed recovery of OIO. The slight recovery which is observed in this simulation was influenced only insignificantly by the formation of I atoms from OIO photolysis, and is mainly due to the continued presence of IO, which maintains a flux to OIO formation through reaction (R1).
In a similar manner, the potential effect of the 532 nm dissociation of O3 to O atoms on the OIO profile was also investigated. Based on the known amounts of O3 and the laser fluence, and using the O3 cross section44 at 532 nm of ≈2.8 × 10−21 cm2 molecule−1, we calculate that ≈1012 O atoms cm−3 can be generated by this scheme. The simulations showed that some OIO recovery could indeed be partially caused by the injection of 1012 O(3P) atoms cm−3. However, experiments in which the influence of O3 on the recovery rate of OIO was investigated by varying the O3 concentration by a factor of ≈4, whilst maintaining the same IO and OIO concentrations revealed no significant change in the OIO recovery rate. This effectively rules out a substantial role of O3 dissociation.
A further possibility is that the absorption of a 532 nm photon by OIO does not lead to dissociation, but results in sufficiently long-lived depopulation of the ground state so that a “temporary” change in optical density is observed, i.e. a photo-bleaching process. This has been proposed by Joseph et al.37 to explain their observation of a rapid (microsecond) recovery of OIO following photolysis at wavelengths between 558 and 578 nm, whereby rapid internal conversion from the excited 2B2 state populates high vibrational levels of the 2B1 ground state, which relax on the microsecond timescale. To test whether our observations are consistent with this hypothesis, numerical simulations were carried out whereby absorption of a photon by OIO resulted in formation of an excited state (OIO*) with variable lifetime with respect to relaxation to OIO. For the dataset displayed in Fig. 4B, the best result was obtained with a relaxation lifetime of 200 μs, which is ≈2 orders of magnitude longer than that observed by Joseph et al. 37 We note that in this simple simulation no attempt was made to differentiate between electronic or vibrational excitation, and we assume that OIO* does not undergo reaction on the time scale of its relaxation, both of which are coarse approximations of a very complex chemical and photo-physical system.
In order to gain further insight in to the origin of the OIO recovery, several datasets were obtained under different experimental conditions. This included variation of bath gas identity and pressure (He, air or N2, 12–70 Torr) and the chemical scheme used to generate OIO. Back-to-back experiments in which the bath gas was switched between N2, He or air or in which ≈3 Torr of N2O was added did not change the recovery rate of OIO, suggesting that vibrational relaxation was not rate limiting, or that N2, O2 or N2O are inefficient quenchers of OIO*. There appeared to be some dependence of the extent and rate of recovery of OIO on the chemical scheme used to initiate its formation, however the large variability from one experiment to the next, precluded detection of a trend. With the aim of searching for evidence of vibrational excitation in OIO following excitation at 532 nm, a limited set of experiments were conducted to examine the OIO profile at a number of band maxima and minima around 550 to 575 nm, which involved use of different dielectric windows to allow both transmission of analysis light and reflection of 532 nm laser light. The experiments were carried out using Scheme 2 as OIO source. Unfortunately, the OIO absorption profiles thus obtained were strongly contaminated by the growth of I2 on roughly the same time scale as OIO formation.
We are therefore able to conclude only that the rate and extent of OIO recovery was controlled by a mixture of both chemical and photo-physical effects, which could not be unravelled in the present experiments.
Several experiments were also carried out in which the 532 nm fluence was varied, and the magnitude of the OIO depletion just after the laser pulse was measured.
For a single photon process, the prompt change in absorption of OIO at 610.2 nm following photolysis, δODOIO610.2, is determined by the 532 nm laser fluence I0 (in photon cm−2), the cross section and, for a dissociative process, the quantum yield of OIO: (ii)where ODOIO532 is the optical density of OIO at the laser wavelength, 532 nm, normalised for 1 cm optical path length, σOIO610.2 is the cross section of OIO at 610.2 nm, and l is the absorption path length (44 cm). The parameter ODOIO532 was obtained from the measured optical density at 610.2 nm, and the ratio (1.3) of OIO cross sections at 532 and 610.2 nm.17
The parameter I0 was taken from the I2 actinometry experiments. Note that this equation is valid if the calculated number of photons absorbed (via the Beer–Lambert equation) is less than the number of absorbing species. Beyond this threshold, OIO is completely depleted. A plot of δODOIO610.2versus the number of photons absorbed by OIO at 532 nm, , should give a straight line with the slope equal to the cross section of OIO at 610.2 nm, multiplied by the quantum yield and the optical path length (44 cm).

Fig. 6 displays the data obtained plotted according to eqn (ii). The extent of OIO depletion varied between ≈10 and 80% as the fluence was varied between 11 and 75 mJ cm−2. At higher fluences the OIO was, within experimental uncertainty completely depleted, and the dependence on fluence thus disappeared.
 Fig. 6  Plot of change on optical density at 610.2 nm due to OIO depletion versus number of photons absorbed (calculated from the effective laser fluence and the Beer–Lambert law, see text for details). Error bars represent statistical errors originating from noise on the OIO profile at 610.2 nm. 
Although the data shows some scatter, the change in optical density with the number of photons absorbed broadly obeys eqn (ii). The slope of the fit line is (2.5 ± 0.2) × 10−16 cm3 molecule−1, which, when divided by the optical length of the cell (44 cm) yields a value for the cross section of OIO at 610.2 nm of (5.7 ± 0.5) × 10−18 cm2 molecule−1 (errors are 2σ statistical only). Examination of the dataset shows that the statistical errors cannot account for the scatter around the fit line, implying additional sources of error. We note that some data points, if analysed alone, would give rise to cross sections as large as 1.0 × 10−17 or as low as 3.5 × 10−18 cm2 molecule−1. For this reason, we expand our error limits to quote a final value of (6 ± 2) × 10−18 cm2 molecule−1.
This method of estimating the cross section assumes a value of the “quantum yield” of unity for the photo-bleaching process, which implies only that no excited state OIO can return to ground state on the time scale of measurement of δODOIO610.2 (i.e. in 10 μs) and may therefore represent a lower limit to the true cross section. We note however that in some experiments at high fluence we were able to observe depletions of OIO of close to 100%, suggesting that any underestimation of δODOIO610.2 could not have been significant.
As discussed above, recent work by Joseph et al.37 suggests that the complete relaxation of excited OIO occurs within 2 μs. Experiments carried out under rather similar experimental conditions including use of the same source of IO (N2O photolysis at 193 nm in the presence of CF3I) and similar concentrations still resulted in a much slower recovery of the OIO signal in our experiments. This may be related to use of a different photolysis wavelength (532 nm in our experiments, 570–590 nm in the Joseph et al. experiments) resulting in excitation of different vibronic states of varying lifetime.
In order to compare our OIO cross section at 610.2 nm with literature numbers, we have taken the relative OIO spectrum of Gómez-Martín et al.17 and normalised it to a value of 6 × 10−18 cm2 molecule−1 at 610.2 nm (See Fig. 2). The resultant spectrum shows good agreement with the value of (1.08 ± 0.21) × 10−17 cm2 molecule−1 reported by Bloss et al.15 and Rowley et al.18 at 549 nm, which was based on a complete kinetic analysis of OIO formation in reactions (R1) and (R2).45 As discussed by Bloss et al.,15 the previously published lower limit to the cross section of Ingham et al.16 was based on a simplified analysis, and was probably erroneous. Very recent data from Joseph et al.,37 using an approach which was similar to that used here, returns a value of (1.51 ± 0.18) × 10−17 cm2 molecule−1 at 567.93 nm, which is presented in Fig. 2. Gómez-Martín et al.17 derive a value of (1.3 ± 0.3) × 10−17 cm2 molecule−1 at 549.15 nm based on a complete spectroscopic and kinetic analysis of the IO self reaction. Given the difficulties associated with the generation and quantification of this reactive radical, the more recent determinations of the OIO cross section can be considered to be in reasonable agreement.
3.3. Photolysis at 532 nm, detection of I atoms
In these experiments, OIO was generated using Scheme 4 only, using the 130 cm cell. The 532 nm Nd-YAG laser was triggered to coincide with the OIO absorption profile, with simultaneous resonance fluorescence detection of I atoms. The experimental procedure was as follows: First, transient absorption due to IO (at 427.2 nm) was measured (trace A in Fig. 7), before the monochromator wavelength was shifted to obtain OIO profiles at 532 nm and then to 535 nm (adjacent minimum to the band at ≈532 nm). These profiles were examined in order to calculate the optimal delay between the excimer and Nd-YAG lasers. This is also displayed in Fig. 7 (trace B), in which corrections for instrumental offsets etc. (see above) have been applied, as has a scaling factor of five for clarity of presentation. Note that the negative spike in the OIO profile at 0.5 ms is due to electrical interference caused by the Q-switch (the Nd-YAG was kept pulsing to maintain stability, but the emission was blocked from entering into the reaction cell). Next, the I atom profile was measured under the same conditions (trace C in Fig. 7) i.e. with the Nd-YAG laser still blocked. The initial strong signal (decreasing in intensity between t = 0 and t = 0.1 ms was due to optical interference caused by the 193 nm excimer laser, and was often (but not always) present in the absence of iodine chemistry. The I atom signal increases between 0.1 and 0.4 ms, which is the behaviour expected from its formation in the IO self reaction, and the observed IO profile (trace A).
 Fig. 7  Transient absorption due to IO (trace A) and OIO (trace B, multiplied by 5) and resonance fluorescence due to I atoms formed in the IO self reaction (trace C). Trace D is the difference in I signal between an experiment in which the Nd-YAG laser was activated at 0.5 ms after the excimer laser pulse (at t = 0) and one in which it was deactivated (i.e. trace C). Trace E is the I atom signal generated by the photolysis of the I2 actinometer. 
This step was then repeated, but with the Nd-YAG laser (532 nm) directed through the cell. The laser fluence was recorded at the end of the cell as 2.2 mJ pulse−1 cm−2. The resultant profile (not shown) was almost identical with C and is therefore displayed as the difference between the two profiles (YAG-laser on minus YAG-laser off), which is trace D. From trace D it is apparent that there is a slight increase in the I atom signal caused by the 532 nm photolysis pulse. In order to calibrate this signal, an actinometry experiment was conducted in which the excimer laser was deactivated, and a flow of I2 added to the flows of O3, CF3I, N2 and O2 already passing through the reaction vessel. Trace E displays the resultant strong signal due to I atoms formed in the photolytic excitation of I2. As discussed in Section 3.2, the I atoms in our system are formed both directly and via collisional predissociation, and initially are present as both I(2P3/2) and I(2P1/2). The presence of 3–4 Torr of O2 ensures that we detect all I(2PJ) as I(2P3/2).
The I(2P3/2) signal initially decays exponentially from an initial signal of 1 × 106 to one of 1 × 105 counts per second (cps) due to its removal by reaction with O3. Subsequently, reformation of I atoms in the IO-self reaction perturb this form of this decay. Nevertheless, the exponential decay over a factor of 10 change in concentration from an initial value of close to 1 × 106 cps serves to confirm that the RF signal due to I atoms varies linearly with [I] in this range. This is an important consideration in analysing the I atom signals formed in the OIO experiments, where a high background I concentration was present. After moving dielectric mirrors DM1 and aluminium mirror MM, the amount of I2 flowing into the cell was monitored by diode array absorption spectroscopy. Once the I2 concentration was known, the optical density at the photolysis wavelength, 532 nm could be calculated using the cross section reported in Section 3.2. As the laser fluence and the I2 concentration are measured, we can estimate the sensitivity of our resonance fluorescence set-up to I atoms. We calculate that at a fluence of 2.2 mJ cm−2, about 3 × 1011 I atoms cm−3 are generated from 2 × 1013 molecules cm−3 of I2. This resulted in a resonance fluorescence signal of 9.5 × 105 cps with a pre-pulse rms noise level of ≈5000 cps. We thus calculate a sensitivity of ≈2 × 10−6 cps per I cm−3 and a detection limit of ≈3 × 109 I cm−3 for an integration time of 5 ms (1000 scans with dwell time of 5 μs).
In theory, the calibrated sensitivity could be used to convert the I atom signal from OIO (79 000 cps in trace D) into an absolute concentration, and this in turn converted to a quantum yield, which requires knowledge of the cross section of OIO to derive its concentration from the measurement of ODOIO532. However, as long as the Beer–Lambert law applies, and the calculated number of photons absorbed (based on measured optical density and laser fluence) is less than the concentration of the absorbing species, we can define the relative I atom signals from I2 photolysis Isig(I2), compared to OIO photolysis, Isig(OIO) as: (iii)where ΦI532(X) is the quantum yield for photodissociation (to I atoms) at 532 nm, Ei is the laser fluence in both experiments and Fi is a parameter related to the detection efficiency (e.g. cps per I atom). In back to back experiments, neither Ei or Fi change significantly, and eqn (iii) can be rearranged to:

 

(iv)The requirement that F not be changed in these back to back experiments is fulfilled as the optical set-up is unchanged and, for low concentrations of added I2, attenuation or quenching of the I atom fluorescence by I2 itself is negligible.46
From the data displayed in Fig. 7, we have ODOIO532 = (5 ± 1) × 10−3 at t = 0.5 ms after the excimer laser pulse, Isig(OIO) = (7.9 ± 0.5) × 104 cps and Isig(I2) = (9.5 ± 0.5) × 105 cps. The optical density of I2 at 532 nm can be calculated from its concentration and the cross section at 532 nm (see above) as  = (5.7 ± 1.7) × 10−3. Under our conditions, the quantum yield of photolysis of I2 at 532 nm is known to be 1 (see Section 3.2), which implies an I atom quantum yield of ΦI532(I2) = 2.
Putting these values in eqn (iv) results in a quantum yield of I formation from OIO photolysis at 532 nm of ΦI532(OIO) = (0.20 ± 0.08) where the errors are propagated from the numbers given above.
In a further, similar set of experiments at 532 nm but with higher concentrations of IO and OIO, and consequently a shorter lived OIO, we obtained a value of ΦI532(OIO) = (0.18 ± 0.07). Combining the results from these two experiments we derive ΦI532(OIO) = (0.19 ± 0.08). The errors given do no include systematic error in e.g.ΦI532(I2) or uncertainty caused by drifts in sensitivity (i.e. changes in Fi) or drifts in the chemical system (i.e. OIO concentration between the measurement of OIO by absorption and its photolysis). As the back-to-back experiments are generally separated by 10–30 minutes, we estimate that this could add a further 20% error.
A further systematic error that would reduce this number is caused by divergence of the excimer laser beam, which results in higher radical concentrations at the entrance end of the reaction vessel (where the RF port is located) compared to the exit end and thus also compared to the average concentration over the length of the reaction cell, which is used to determine the OIO absorption. This implies that the true absorption of OIO at the resonance fluorescence port is higher than used in the calculation. This argument does not apply for I2 actinometry as the I2 is not formed in a laser pulse, meaning that the term  and thus the quantum yield should be smaller. Unpublished data from this laboratory on the IO self reaction under similar (high ozone) conditions have shown that the relative concentration of IO and OIO does not vary significantly with amount of IO formed despite the fact that the OIO production rate must depend quadratically on the IO concentration (reaction (R1)). As the maximum IO concentration varies approximately linearly with laser fluence, we therefore expect that the concentration of OIO does this also. The divergence in the 193 nm excimer beam results in a change of a factor of ≈1.5 in laser fluence between the resonance fluorescence port and the exit end of the cell (a distance of ≈1 m). The concentration of OIO at the RF port is thus expected to be a factor of ≈(1.2 ± 0.2) greater than that measured along the length of the cell by optical absorption. The correction for laser divergence results in ΦI532(OIO) = (0.16 ± 0.08) or an upper limit of 0.24.
As it is not possible with the Nd-YAG laser to vary the photolysis wavelength to explore maxima and minima of the OIO spectrum and confirm that OIO is the source of the I atoms which we observe, the time between the excimer and YAG was instead adjusted. The results from a set of experiments in which the 532 nm Nd-YAG laser was triggered at various delay times after the excimer laser (t = 0) is shown in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  Raw data from an experiment in which the 532 nm YAG laser was triggered at various times after the excimer laser. Trace A, OIO absorption profile; trace B–E, I atom profiles. Traces B, C and D are offset by 1.1 × 106, 0.7 × 106 and 0.35 × 106 cps, respectively. The vertical lines indicate the time at which the 532 nm Nd-YAG laser was triggered, e.g. TD indicates the time at which the YAG was triggered during acquisition of trace D. 
Immediately apparent from this data set is the comparably strong I atom signal following 532 nm photolysis at 2 ms after the excimer laser (trace C), and easily detectable signals at 4 and 7 ms also. All of these prompt signals were obtained at reaction times where the OIO concentration had decayed to zero (trace A), and can clearly not be associated with its photolysis. The assignment of these signals to I atoms is confirmed by their decay rate, which is consistent with the rate coefficient for reaction of I with O3 and the O3 concentration.
One likely precursor of the I atoms observed at long reaction times and at 532 nm photolysis is I2, which may be formed in the reaction mixture. The signal we observed at t = 2 ms was 1.7 × 105 cps, which, by comparison to the actinometry experiments, in which I2 was photolysed at the same laser energy, may be attributable to ≈4 × 1012 I2 molecules cm−3.
The measurement of I atom photofragments in a complex reaction mixture cannot however provide unambiguous evidence of the role of I2 as the source of I atoms. We therefore made use of the fact that I2 can be detected by laser induced fluorescence (LIF) following excitation into its banded absorption spectrum above 500 nm (B 3Π+0u
					← X 1Σ0g transition),47 albeit at reduced sensitivity due to the rapid quenching of I2* at these pressures. Experiments were undertaken in which laser induced fluorescence (excited at 532 nm) was detected by a red sensitive PMT (PMT 3 in Fig. 1) screened by a 560 nm cut off filter to reduce stray light from the excitation laser.
The results of such an experiment are displayed in Fig. 9, which shows four LIF traces obtained at various time delays after the excimer laser was triggered. Trace A was obtained at 0.5 ms delay, which coincides with the maximum of the OIO signal, and reveals no LIF signal. At longer delays, e.g. 2, 4 or 7 ms a signal is however observed, and can be compared to the strong signal of a calibration experiment (trace E) in which a known amount of I2 was added to the mixture. This comparison is purely qualitative, as the dependence of the LIF signal on I2 concentration was not investigated for this particular set of experiments. The assignment of these signals to I2-LIF could conceivably be confirmed by measuring the decay rate of fluorescence and comparing this to the lifetime of the excited B 3Π+0u of I2. Although the collision free lifetime of the B 3Π+0u state is ≈1 μs for 532 nm excitation, it is rapidly quenched under the conditions of our experiment with a lifetime of ≈10 ns for 70 Torr N2.47 The observed signal decay rates were indeed consistent with such a rate constant, and serve to rule out that the LIF is caused by fluorescence of a molecule with a long lived excited state. However, given that the pulse width of the excitation laser is ≈6 ns, electron transit times in the PMT are tens of ns, and that the 100 MHz oscilloscope used for data acquisition cannot resolve such fast events, analysis of the decay rate cannot provide unambiguous assignment to I2. We also note that the signals presented in Fig. 9 are the difference signals obtained when the excimer laser is either on or deactivated. The raw signals are both orders of magnitude larger than the difference, and over interpretation of these signals should be avoided.
 Fig. 9  Fluorescence signals induced by 532 nm excitation following the 193 nm photolysis of O3/CF3I. The OIO profiles are displayed in Fig. 8. As in Fig. 8, the 532 nm laser was delayed relative to the excimer laser (193 nm) by (A) 0.5 ms (peak of OIO profile), B 2.0 ms, (C) 4.0 ms and (D) 7.0 ms. The strong signal (trace E) is due to LIF of added I2 (≈2.7 × 1013 molecule cm−3). 
In summary, we see I atom photofragments following laser photolysis at 532 nm, and we see short lived LIF signals following laser excitation at the same wavelength. The evolution of the signals have similarities (i.e. none or small signals at short times, ruling out OIO as photolyte, and increasing signals at longer times after the excimer laser), yet are different as the LIF signal is roughly constant between 2 and 7 ms, whereas the I atom signal maximises at 2 ms and subsequently decays. It is unclear whether I2 is chemically stable in a chemical environment containing several higher oxides of iodine such as OIO and I2O2, so the fact that the I atom precursor decays with reaction time does not rule out that I2 is the photolyte. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assign the origin of these observations (or at least part of the origin) to the presence of I2. At a concentration of ≈1 × 1012 molecules cm−3, I2 could arise directly from a minor channel in the self-reaction of IO. As this initial IO concentration was ≈2 × 1013 molecules cm−3, this would constitute a minor branching ratio of ≈10%. In effect, as we see that the apparent I2 signal decays with time, this branching ratio would have to be higher to take loss of I2 during the IO self reaction into account. A branching ratio of >10% is not consistent with the results of several studies, which have shown that this reaction channel is not important.15,48–50 The secondary formation of I2 in studies of the IO self reaction has however been observed on several occasions15,48,49 and has been suggested to involve reactions of I atoms with a product of the IO self reaction,48 or with IO to form I2O that further reacts with I atoms to generate I215,49 rather than be formed directly. I + IO + M → I2O + M(R17) I2O + I → I2 + IO(R18)
A further possibility, proposed by Joseph et al.37 is that I2 is formed in the reaction of OIO with I atoms: I + OIO → I2 + O2(R19)Given that the I atom signals measured from the 532 photolysis arise partially (or wholly) from photolysis of species that clearly cannot be assigned to OIO, the measured quantum yield of ΦI532(OIO) = (0.16 ± 0.08) should be regarded as an upper limit.
This result is entirely consistent with a previous determination from this group16 which relied on estimations of photon fluence rather than in situ actinometry to derive an upper limit to the quantum yield of 0.15 for I atom formation from photolysis of OIO at 532 nm. In contrast to the present study, Ingham et al.,16 observed I atom signals which had a temporal profile similar to that of OIO, (suggesting that OIO was the precursor) yet only were observable at very high laser fluences (90–140 mJ cm−2). In order to explain this, and the lack of I atom formation at lower fluences (2 mJ cm−2) at which substantial fractions of OIO would have been converted to detectable amounts of I atoms, the authors suggested that I atoms were formed in a sequential two-photon process, with saturation of the first transition. A simpler explanation of these observations is that the I atoms observed at high laser fluence were actually formed from photolysis of small amounts of I2 or another weakly absorbing, I containing species which was formed in their chemical system, and which had a similar temporal profile to OIO. Indeed, Joseph et al.37 point out that the OIO spectrum presented by Ingham et al.16 appears to be contaminated by I2.
As Ingham et al. used a different source chemistry for IO formation, the photolysis of CH2I2 at 351 nm in the presence of O3, and worked with different initial IO and OIO concentrations compared to the present study, it is not surprising that the coincidental overlap of the I atoms precursor profile which was found in that work could not be reproduced here. In this context, we note that in the present experiments we report significant I2 formation when CH2I2 photolysis was used as OIO source (Section 3.2).
3.4. Photolysis of OIO at different wavelengths with I atom detection
In the experiments at 532 nm, we were unable to detect dissociation of OIO to form I atoms. In order to investigate the possibility that excitation into some of the vibrational bands at longer wavelengths can lead to dissociation, a series of experiments were carried out using a pulsed, tuneable dye laser as photolysis laser. Photolysis was carried out wavelengths corresponding to both maxima (562.3 nm, 567.9 nm and 573.8 nm) as well as minima (566.0 nm and 572.0 nm) of the OIO spectrum. Photolysis at wavelengths in which the bending motion of electronically excited OIO brings the two O-atoms closer together, which may aid elimination of the central I atom, might conceivably be more efficient than for wavelengths at which this bending motion is not excited. At the three wavelengths listed above, the quantum number (ν′2) for the bending motion of upper state OIO is 2, 1 and 0, respectively for 562.3 nm, 567.9 nm and 573.8 nm.14 For 532 nm experiments, ν′2 is equal to 1.
The experiments were conducted in the same manner as those described for 532 nm photolysis in Section 3.3. i.e. following measurement of an IO profile at 427.2 nm, the OIO profile, ODOIOλ/nm, was measured at the wavelength at which was subsequently to be photolysed, usually a peak in its spectrum. An absorption trace in an adjacent trough of the OIO spectrum was always measured to confirm the identity of the absorber, and to enable correction for wavelength independent optical and electrical interference. This profile of OIO was then inspected to define the appropriate delays between the excimer and YAG lasers to photolyse OIO at the maximum of its transient absorption profile. Actinometry with known amounts of I2 and the same laser fluence was subsequently performed.

Eqn (iv) can be used to analyse the data, with ODx532 replaced by the measured value of ODxλ (where x = I2 or OIO). As previously, we adopt a wavelength independent quantum yield of dissociation of I2 of 1.0, or a yield of 2 for formation of I atoms. The value of the OD due to I2 at the photolysis wavelength, was obtained by first converting the absorbance spectrum of I2 (obtained using the diode array) to a concentration by spectral fitting to the reference spectrum, before converting the concentration to an OD at the photolysis wavelength by use of cross sections at each single wavelength. These cross sections (at 562.3, 566.0, 567.8, 572.0 and 573.8 nm) were obtained in separate experiments by measuring the extinction of the laser light at each wavelength using the joulemeter as detector, compared to the extinction at 480 nm in the continuum part of the I2 spectrum using the xenon lamp as light source and monochromator and PMT for detection. The resulting cross sections at the laser wavelengths are displayed in Fig. 2, where they are compared to a literature spectrum. As expected, there are obvious differences, which reflect the lower instrumental resolution of the literature compared to the fine structure of the I2 spectrum, and the small linewidth of the laser (nominally < 0.14 cm−1). The cross sections obtained (in units of cm2 molecule−1) were (9.4 ± 0.9) × 10−19 (562.3 nm), (1.5 ± 0.3) × 10−18 (566.0 nm), (7.4 ± 1.4) × 10−19 (567.9 nm), (1.2 ± 0.07) × 10−18 (572.0 nm) and (7.5 ± 1.0) × 10−19 (573.8 nm). The errors are given to reflect the unexpectedly high scatter in multiple measurements, which may have been the result of poor wavelength reproducibility due to e.g. temperature changes. Effects of laser intensity and cell flush rate were found to be small compared to this variability.
No evidence was found for formation of I atoms in any experiment when the dye laser pulse coincided temporally with the maximum of the transient absorption profile of OIO, and its wavelength coincided with an absorption peak in the OIO spectrum. As no signals were observable above the noise levels in these experiments, either at maxima or minima of the OIO absorption spectra, only upper limits can be obtained for I atom signals arising from OIO dissociation. The variability of the chemical system and the different laser intensity at the different wavelengths investigated resulted in some scatter in the measurement of the upper limit to the quantum yield at each wavelength. The best values (i.e. lowest upper limits) were obtained in experiments with large amounts of OIO, high laser fluence and a photolysis wavelength at the peak of an absorption band of OIO. The data obtained is consistent with a value of ΦIλ/nm(OIO) < 0.02 for measurements at the peaks of the absorption bands, as displayed in Fig. 10, which also shows the OIO spectrum over the range of photolysis wavelengths used in this study. Considerations of potential systematic errors including cross sections in I2 at the laser wavelengths and possible non-linearity of the I signal at high concentrations leads to quote a final, conservative upper limit of 0.05.
 Fig. 10  Wavelength dependent upper limits to the quantum yield of I atom formation, ΦIλ/nm(OIO). The horizontal lines at the bottom of the figure indicate the triplet structure of the OIO absorption. The change in the vibrational quantum number for the bending vibration, increases from 0 to 2 in going from the longest to the shortest wavelength band in each triplet. 
In addition to photolysis at the maximum of the OIO absorption trace, experiments were carried out at various delays between the excimer and dye laser. As in the case of experiments at 532 nm, signals due to I atom photofragments were indeed observed as the delay was extended to beyond the chemical lifetime of OIO. The results of an experiment in which we observed I atom signals at various photolysis wavelengths, and at various delays is displayed in Fig. 11. At a photolysis wavelength of 562.3 nm (peak in OIO spectrum) the signal due to I atoms is seen to increase when the delay was increased out to 1 ms (at this reaction time the absorption due to OIO has almost decayed to zero), and then decreased at a delay of 1.5 ms. At this delay the laser wavelength was then sequentially changed to 566, 567.9 and 572 nm, and I atom signals recorded.
 Fig. 11  Data showing I atom formation at different dye laser photolysis wavelengths and at different delay times after the excimer laser. The OIO absorption profile is also displayed. 
The data points in Fig. 11 have been normalised for variations in laser fluence as the laser wavelength was adjusted. The results are essentially the same as those observed at 532 nm, i.e. I atoms are only observed at long delays, corresponding to times that exceed the chemical lifetime of OIO. Clues to the identity of the photolytic I atom precursor responsible for these signals could in principal be derived from their wavelength dependence. A comparison with the cross sections of I2 which we measured at the laser wavelengths (see above) shows that the signal does not vary consistently with I2 cross section, possibly because the signals do not stem solely from photolysis of I2 and possible also due to wavelength inaccuracies when working with finely structured absorbers.
4. Conclusions and implications for the atmosphere
OIO was generated in situ in sufficiently high concentrations to examine its photolysis at several wavelengths that correspond to both absorption maxima and minima in its visible spectrum.
By observing the prompt depletion of OIO following absorption of a known number of photons at 532 nm we have been able to derive an absorption cross section at 610.2 nm of (6 ± 2) × 10−18 cm2 molecule−1. A significant recovery of the OIO signal was observed over a time scale of ≈0.5 ms, indicating that the observed depletion of OIO could not be attributed to bond dissociation, but some evidence for temporary bleaching of the ground state via population of a sufficiently long lived excited species was obtained. In complementary experiments, we placed upper limits to the I atom quantum yield of 0.24 at 532 nm and 0.02 at 567.9, 573.8 or 562.3 nm. These results confirm our previous observations that I atoms were not detectable at low laser fluences, and together with our previous results on O(3P) formation,16 quantum chemical calculations of the enthalpy of formation of OIO 25 and the recent experiments of Joseph et al.,37 suggest that OIO is rather stable with respect to photolysis in its visible bands. Observation of I atom photofragments that occurred after the OIO concentration had decayed to zero strongly suggested that the chemical system which we use to generate OIO is a rather complex one, which contains other I atom generating photolytes, with I2 likely to be an important contributor.
This work has established that the quantum yield of photolysis of OIO is small, and for the purpose of the following discussion of atmospheric implications we can assume a conservative value of less than ≈0.1. OIO possesses strong absorption bands in a region where the flux of sunlight in the boundary layer is large. Indeed, based on a previous calculations51 of the atmospheric dissociation rate constant for OIO of 0.28 s−1 (which assumes a quantum yield of unity) we can easily calculate the lifetime to be less than one minute even if the quantum yield is taken to be just 0.1. Assuming that the IO self reaction is the only source of OIO and photolysis its only loss process, a simple steady state analysis assuming 5 ppt of IO and using the presently recommended rate constant and branching ratio to OIO in the IO self reaction52 enables us to calculate a steady state concentration of OIO of less than 1 ppt. On the other hand, a quantum yield of 0.02 (the lowest value measured in these experiments) would result in a steady state concentrations of OIO that are similar to those of IO, and probably detectable by differential absorption spectroscopy. Even this low quantum yield would still assign to OIO a relatively insignificant role as reservoir of reactive iodine, and renders other potential loss processes such as reaction with NO or OH rather unimportant.51 The present study has provided some clues to the photochemical activity of OIO in the atmosphere, but further laboratory research is clearly desirable to better constrain model calculations of its impact and role in the chemistry of the marine boundary layer.

 	Scheme 1  248 nm Photolysis of O3 in the presence of I2. The O3 concentration was varied between 5–10 × 1014 molecule cm−3 and that of I2 between 5–10 × 1014 molecule cm−3. A 248 nm laser fluence of ≈30–35 mJ cm−2 was sufficient to generate ≈1 × 1014 IO cm−3. Higher concentrations of O3 were avoided to prevent excessive attenuation of the laser light and the resulting gradients in radical concentrations.	 

 	Scheme 2  248 nm Photolysis of O3/CH2I2. In this case, both CH2I2 and O3 were dissociated and the relative contribution to IO formation from reactions (R3) and (R11) was controlled by the concentrations and 248 nm absorption cross sections of CH2I2 (6–8 × 1014 molecule cm−3, σ248 = 1.57 × 10−18 cm2 molecule−133) and O3 (5–9 × 1014 molecule cm−3, σ248 = 1.07 × 10−17 cm2 molecule−1.34), though O3 photolysis was generally dominant.	 

 	Scheme 3  193 nm Photolysis of N2O in the presence of CF3I. Typical concentrations of N2O and CF3I were 3 × 1017 molecule cm−3 and 9 × 1015 molecule cm−3, respectively. Due to its relatively small absorption cross section at 193 nm (8.95 × 10−20 cm2 molecule−135) high concentrations of N2O were used to generate sufficient IO. For this reason, all experiments were carried out in N2 bath gas to minimise the reaction of O(1D) with N2O.	 

 	Scheme 4  193 nm Photolysis of O3 in the presence of CF3I. This scheme, used in experiments to detection I photofragments from OIO photolysis, utilises the fact that O3 absorbs relatively weakly at 193 nm (σ193nm = 4.36 × 10−19 cm2 molecule−134) to enable the use of high concentrations, which result in efficient recycling of I atoms formed in the IO self reaction, and thus maximising the OIO yield. It also suppresses the background I atom concentration, which was important in experiments where I atoms were detected directly. The yield of IO in reaction (R13) has been shown to be about 0.9. 27,36 Experiments using this IO generation scheme were carried out in N2 bath gas at pressures generally close to 70 Torr, with a few Torr of O2 added. The O3 concentration was generally 1–3 × 1016 molecule cm−3, with CF3I present at ≈7–11 × 1015 molecule cm−3.	 

 	Fig. 3  Transient absorption due to IO at 427.2 nm and OIO at 532 nm and 549.1 nm following the pulsed photolysis at 193 nm of mixture of O3/CF3I/N2/O2 at 70 Torr.

The slope, 0.9 ± 0.15, gives the relative cross section of I2 at 532 nm compared to 500 nm.

 	Fig. 6  Plot of change on optical density at 610.2 nm due to OIO depletion versus number of photons absorbed (calculated from the effective laser fluence and the Beer–Lambert law, see text for details). Error bars represent statistical errors originating from noise on the OIO profile at 610.2 nm.	 

 	Fig. 7  Transient absorption due to IO (trace A) and OIO (trace B, multiplied by 5) and resonance fluorescence due to I atoms formed in the IO self reaction (trace C). Trace D is the difference in I signal between an experiment in which the Nd-YAG laser was activated at 0.5 ms after the excimer laser pulse (at t = 0) and one in which it was deactivated (i.e. trace C). Trace E is the I atom signal generated by the photolysis of the I2 actinometer.

Traces B, C and D are offset by 1.1 × 106, 0.7 × 106 and 0.35 × 106 cps, respectively. The vertical lines indicate the time at which the 532 nm Nd-YAG laser was triggered, e.g. TD indicates the time at which the YAG was triggered during acquisition of trace D.	 

 	Fig. 9  Fluorescence signals induced by 532 nm excitation following the 193 nm photolysis of O3/CF3I. The OIO profiles are displayed in Fig. 8. As in Fig. 8, the 532 nm laser was delayed relative to the excimer laser (193 nm) by (A) 0.5 ms (peak of OIO profile), B 2.0 ms, (C) 4.0 ms and (D) 7.0 ms. The strong signal (trace E) is due to LIF of added I2 (≈2.7 × 1013 molecule cm−3).

The horizontal lines at the bottom of the figure indicate the triplet structure of the OIO absorption. The change in the vibrational quantum number for the bending vibration, increases from 0 to 2 in going from the longest to the shortest wavelength band in each triplet.
