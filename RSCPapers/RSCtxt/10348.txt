    , Accepted 8th January 2013First published on 9th January 2013AbstractA mathematical model for a photosynthesis-inspired regenerative photogalvanic device, for transient rather than exclusively steady-state conditions, based on molecular electrochemistry rather than electron transfer processes involving semiconductors, is considered within this work and which is adapted from an experimental system previously developed (J. E. Halls and J. D. Wadhawan, Energy Environ. Sci., 2012, 5, 6541). Computational simulations suggest that pragmatically achievable systems behave as middle-of-the-range photo-rechargeable electrochemical capacitors for light-to-electrical energy storage; in contrast the system performance as a light-to-electrical energy convertor (viz., solar cell), for cells constructed from electrochemically reversible redox couples with fast photo-induced electron transfer reactions is critically dependent on the concentration of the supersensitiser; maximum power conversion efficiency of ca. 6.5% under 500 nm light, 2.4 mW cm−2 intensity for typical experimental parameters, neglecting Ohmic losses, and employing galvanostatic discharge, with a power conversion efficiency that is capable of being increased by a factor of five (to ca. 34%) when the supersensitizer concentration increases by an order of magnitude (from 5.0 to 50.0 mM). Under an AM 2.0 solar spectrum, numerical simulations suggest that one potentially pragmatically achievable embodiment of this regenerative system is able to perform with a solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiency of 4.5% – an attractive realistic single cell value.
1. Introduction
Solar-to-electrical energy conversion is currently an active field,1 motivated by desires to generate “carbon-free” electricity at low fiscal cost, and to exploit this through the increased electrification of energy by the end-user.2 For direct electricity generation, the efficient harvesting of light energy necessitates an asymmetry to be embedded within the charge separation process that occurs within the spatial region close to an illuminated electrode. This has empowered several types of low cost, semiconductor-based photovoltaic (PV) devices which function through the photochemical production of either weakly bound (Wannier) or strongly bound (Frenkel) excitons;3 the dissociation of the latter at the interface between donor and acceptor fluids (fashioned either in a planar bilayer,4a or in a blended,4b bulk heterogeneous arrangement) is exploited in organic semiconductor solar cells, with electron–hole separation of Wannier exitons underpinning the operation of both solid-state based extremely thin absorber solar cells4c and electrochemical PV (“wet PV”) devices, such as dye-sensitized mesoscopic systems.4d The latter devices exploit light energy to drive an endoergic reaction at a semiconductor electrode at a potential not possible in the dark, with the reverse reaction essentially taking place at the counter electrode, so that electrical power is produced without net chemical conversion. Such devices, though attractive through “cost-per-watt” assessments, only permit the direct conversion of light energy – there is no embedded route to the storage of this energy, except through the powering of the turbines in hydropower stations, via compressed-air energy storage, or in the charging of electrochemical devices such as batteries.2 Moreover, the use of sometimes highly environmentally toxic materials5 as the light-harvesting material is not an ideal scenario for a truly “green” light-to-electrical energy conversion system; indeed, Natural Selection has empowered a molecular approach through light-induced transformation of a (bio)chemical fuel source.1a
In this respect, photogalvanic (PG, chemical consuming, but rechargeable) cells based on molecular, rather than semiconductor,6 systems then become attractive, and low cost, routes for the direct conversion of light energy with storage of electrical potential energy: power-producing photogalvanic cells operate through a solution-based, light-driven redox reaction that is thermodynamically non-spontaneous in the dark, allowing the system to act as a solar cell in a charged state, in addition to empowering the battery to be charged in the light, and discharged in the dark. Conventional PG systems involve the following series of generic reactions:6,7
in the solution: A + Z ⇄ B + Y  A* + Z → B + Y
at the electrodes:B → A ± e−, orY ± e− → Zwhere it is the photo-induced homogeneous electron transfer reaction that changes the concentration ratio of species A/B and Y/Z, allowing for power generation. However, these systems have not been considered to be mainstream or pragmatic cells for the efficient conversion of solar power: although, under AM 2.0 conditions (corresponding to a Sun elevation angle of 30°), maximum power conversions of 5% (for green photons) or 18% (for a red photon redox reaction) have been calculated for idealised homogeneous,7a semiconductor-free systems in which species Y and Z are of concentrations much greater than species A and B, practical cells afford typically much less than 1% power conversion, even under monochromatic conditions.6,7
In order to address this, whilst noting that liquid–liquid interfaces exhibit similarity with semiconductor–electrolyte interfaces, so that asymmetry of charge separation may be maintained through the use of a pseudo liquid–liquid interface,8 we have recently advocated the use of lyotropic liquid crystals in the normal lamellar (Lα) phase as frameworks for these devices,9 since the alternating hydrophobic/hydrophilic layers can be doped with different photoredox-active species whilst affording a spatial separation of chemical species based on their lipophilicity, and so that transport lengths of individual species are vastly reduced compared with conventional systems.6,7,9 Owing to these framework materials being viscous, mass transport is slow (typical diffusion coefficients are on the order of 10−7 cm2 s−1). Inasmuch as this then impacts on the rate of bimolecular reactions, it also implies that conventional PG cell chemistry cannot operate efficiently within this framework, leading to the requirement of cells based on different electrode reactions – one controlled by light, the other being unaffected by the light reaction. For these purposes, we demonstrated that a sacrificial dark electrode acting as one half of the cell can be used advantageously so as to dominate the open circuit voltage of the resulting device.10 This “trick” allows for a high voltage at open circuit, and ensures that the photo-induced electron transfer process affects only the illuminated electrode, and so that the system resembles the chemistry of a fuel cell with irreversibly chemically consumption of a fuel source X:
close to the electrode:  A* + X → B + X˙−
at the illuminated electrode:B + e− → A
at the dark electrode:P − e− → M
Indeed, in a previous work,9 we showed that such systems based on zinc anodes can afford maximum power conversion efficiencies of 1.8% under violet light. We note that our advocated approach fundamentally differs from the molecular PG cells mathematically characterised by Albery and Archer6,7 in that it holds zero requirement for the reactions at both electrodes to be chemically dependent on each other via an electron transfer shuttle occurring within the bulk of the device; in our system, as in the case of traditional semiconductor PG devices,6b a series of photochemically induced electron transfer reactions affect one electrode, with the other electrode having a potential controlled by a separate redox couple, so that the electrode reactions are connected only via the current drawn by a load in the external circuit. Unlike those semiconductor PG systems, our cell exploits a single quasi-biphasic phase as the reaction medium, and so does not demand the deployment of a membrane separator; our system is membrane-free, whilst holding the additional advantage of employing low-resistance metallic electrodes that do not suffer from photocorrosion.
In order for such systems to be of pragmatic value as solar cells, both aqueous and surfactant pseudophases need to be electrically conductive and light absorption should be at least around 500 nm since this is close to the maximum in solar irradiance, under AM 2.0 conditions.11 Furthermore, it is preferable that as much of the light is absorbed as possible; this requires a large depth of light penetration, with the resulting photoredox reaction affecting the potential of the illuminated electrode. Accordingly, to exploit the Lα framework effectively, and to keep the system entirely regenerative (“self-sustaining”) under illumination, we need to embed an electron transport chain to relay the effects of the light perturbation to the electrode, whilst ensuring that the products of a photoredox reaction are spatially separated from the parent species, so that a kinetic asymmetry in the rates of the forward and backward electron transfers is built into the system.
Here we illustrate, through mathematical modelling and numerical simulation, how an electron transfer relay may be introduced to the experimental system we have previously reported.9 Whilst the simulated case studied is an idealised, but crude, supersensitized, regenerative PG cell, we place particular emphasis placed on the production of insight into the limitations of pragmatically achievable systems.
2. Theory
2.1 Development of a mathematical framework for a regenerative PG device
Since the Lα framework considered in our earlier work9 is a single, thermodynamic phase, we consider, for simplicity, the whole medium as though it is effectively diffusionally-isotropic when it is sandwiched between two electrodes. This has been suggested in earlier work both within our laboratory, and in others.12 For the system to behave as though it is a regenerative PG cell, we consider the following idealised and general mechanism occurring within a single, effectively homogenous environment, noting that the quasi-biphasic nature of the system allows for the species that participate in the electrode reactions (A, B, M and P) may be spatially separated, empowering the occurrence of differential electrode kinetics – it is thus not necessary in this work to consider the development of “mixed-potentials” at the electrodes.
Light-induced reactions in the solution:      
At the illuminated electrode:B + e− ⇄ A E0′, ks, α
At the dark electrode:P − e− ⇄ M E0′2, ks2, α2
Note that we have ignored the possibility of unimolecular decay of the photoexcited state, as we wish to simplify the system; this is tantamount to faster loss of S* through reaction with A compared with its own relaxation to the ground state. Note that we do not explicitly consider a sacrificial dark electrode, since we wish to focus on the light reactions, and thereby illustrate the cell for a generalized one-electron process. In these reactions, S is a supersensitizer, whose rôle is to capture light energy at a wavelength within the visible spectrum. In the calculations developed in this work, we shall assume this wavelength is 500 nm – a value close to that corresponding to the maximum irradiance in AM 2.0 solar light.11 All other species are assumed to be photochemically inactive. In this crude model, the supersensitiser (S) and its reduced form (S−) are considered to be inactive at the electrode surface; it is assumed that the photoexcited state (S*) is quenched at the electrode.
Species A is oxidised by the photoexcited supersensitiser, so that the regenerative step is reaction of the reduced form of the latter (S−) through a collisional deactivation with a third body, Z. We shall assume that the latter is of high concentration, and that the regenerative reaction occurs under diffusional control, so that this bimolecular process is pseudo-first order, with rate constant k2. Furthermore, we make the assumption that both Z and Z− are electro-inactive at the surface of both electrodes, so that the calculation is further simplified by not requiring their further consideration.
Thus, we may write the following transport equations, where we assume that all diffusion coefficients (D) are identical, and that the system is fully electrochemically-supported so that electrical migration contributions to the transport are negligible, and so that we may neglect variations in activity coefficients. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) In the above, we assume that one spatial dimension (denoted as x) is sufficient for modeling diffusion-only transport within parallel-electrode cell given in Fig. 1, ci represents the concentration of species i, t is the temporal variable, ε is the molar extinction coefficient of species S, ϕ is the quantum yield of the light absorption (assumed throughout this work to be unity) and I is the molar light flux.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the idealistic model employed within this work. 
We further assume that light enters the device (of thickness ) through the illuminated electrode which is on the left-hand electrode as depicted in Fig. 1, with intensity I0 at x = 0 (the surface of the illuminated electrode). Provided this electrode does not absorb any incident light from the source, I0 will be the incident light flux. By the time the light reaches the dark electrode at x = , its intensity will be attenuated through the condition , where we have further assumed ε ≠ ε(x). Indeed, this is the familiar Lambert–Beer law, I = I0e−εcSx. For simplicity, we shall assume that the light intensity is not spatially variable, so that its intensity is kept at I = I0 for all x; Taylor expansion of the Lambert–Beer law then suggests that for typical supersensitizers in low (millimolar) concentrations (ε = 15000 M−1 cm−1, cS = 5.0 mM),  is then restricted to being ca. 25 μm, for a less than 20% attenuation of light intensity across the cell. For the Lα phase employed in our previous work,9 this is not a drastic assumption – the fundamental repeat unit of this structure, as determined through X-ray scattering, is known13 to be ca. 61 Å. Nevertheless, we chose to use an alternative way of expressing this, viz. through restricting the timescale employed to being typically 10 s, and at most 20 s (in light-charge or electrical-discharge mode), exploiting the Einstein–Smoluchowski view, , where D is, as noted earlier, typically 10−7 cm2 s−1. This formulation allows for the consideration of thick ( = 1.0 mm) cells, as employed in earlier experimental work,9 whilst benefiting from the additional simplification of not having to consider natural convective transport.14
The pertinent boundary conditions under which the transport equations are solved are as follows, where we assume the Butler–Volmer formulation of the electrode kinetics (parameterized by heterogeneous rate constants ks and ks2, and symmetry coefficients of α and α2, for the illuminated and dark electrodes, respectively) is sufficient to describe the electrode reactions.  where  and F is the Faraday constant, with R being the molar gas constant, T the absolute temperature, and EL and ED representing the potentials of the illuminated and dark electrodes, respectively against the same reference. The current (i) flowing in the external circuit then is given by: (6)where S is the geometric area of the electrodes (assumed to be the same for both illuminated and dark electrodes). Note that we do not consider the capacitative current at either electrode.
Thus, under galvanostatic control, the transport equations may be solved numerically through normalization of concentrations by (c0A + c0B), and conversion into finite difference form, through linearization of the bimolecular terms:15 (7)in which reduced concentrations are expressed in lower case, j being a particular spatial node and t denotes the temporal variable. To circumvent any problem resulting through the lack of rigorous control over material conservation in the finite difference method,16a we chose to simulate only one half of the redox couple at each electrode (viz. species A and M), thereby allowing mass conservation to be imposed for the calculation of species B and P. In noting that the five partial differential equations are all coupled, with the exception of that pertaining to species M, we chose to solve all of these equations in one sweep using a bespoke undecadiagonal matrix algorithm (q.v. Appendix), solving through LU decomposition in a manner similar to Newman's tridiagonal BAND(J) subroutine16b and White's pentadiagonal extension MBAND.16c This approach was observed to be more computationally efficient than similar multidiagonal matrix algorithm solvers we have employed.16d
2.2 Calculation of cell potentials under polarisation
The determination of the concentrations of species A and B at the illuminated electrode, and species M and P at the dark electrode empower the ready computation of the potentials at the electrodes, since the relevant surface concentrations of species A and M may be determined through:  so that, (8) (9)if the symmetry factor is 1/2 for both electrode reactions. Note that only the positive root is taken in these expressions, so as to afford real values of the electrode potentials. For the cases where the symmetry factor was not 1/2, the above values were used as the first approximation in a Newton–Raphson iterative scheme, with subsequent approximations (indexed by dummy variable q) given in adimensional form:  where χ = exp(ξ) and ζ = exp(ξ2). It was observed this approach required at most five iterations under the most extreme value combinations of the rate constants and symmetry factors tested, to a dimensionless tolerance level of 10−20 in χ or ζ. Note that the cell voltage, Ecell, is given through the expression Ecell = EL − ED.
2.3 Assessment of the cell performance characteristics
Accordingly, these calculations enable the determination of galvanostatic discharge curves (ignoring any Ohmic losses), under any arbitrary state of charge in the presence or absence of illumination, thereby providing a route to the determination of the relevant figures-of-merit17 for the performance of this system either as a solar cell, or a solar-rechargeable battery: for the latter, the important parameter is the energy conversion efficiency (ECE) defined as the ratio between the electrical energy delivered to the light energy input: (10)where the numerator represents the energy density delivered through electrical work via integration of the discharge curve in the dark (over the time when electrical discharge occurs in the dark, as soon at the light is turned off), and the denominator is light energy density input during the open circuit charging period: h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, λ is the wavelength of irradiation, ton is the time over which irradiation occurs.
For the assessment of the light-to-electrical power conversion efficiency (PCE) – the most important parameter for the assessment of the device acting as a solar cell, for any given state-of-charge of the device, the energy delivered in the dark under a specific constant current discharge was first determined, and compared with that observed when the discharge occurred under illumination at the same specified constant current. Normalisation of the difference between the electrical work done in the presence and absence of light by the illuminated discharge time and the incident light power affords the PCE: (11)Note that this formulation of the PCE is best-suited for the time-limited transient approach we have chosen to adopt for this work; the only other suitable alternative would require all the discharge curves to be run until a particular voltage cut-off point.
We consider the characteristics of the cell under both types of operation only under λ = 500 nm with fast electrode kinetics (ks = ks2 = 1.0 cm s−1; α = α2 = 1/2), since spontaneous (discharge) reactions do a maximum amount of work under thermodynamically reversible conditions. We note that since both ECE and PCE are directly proportional to the illumination wavelength, these will both increase as the incident photon energy is decreased. Likewise, unless otherwise specified, simulations were undertaken with the following experimentally realistic variables: E0 = +0.86 V vs. SHE, E02 = −0.76 V vs. SHE, c0A + c0B = 15 mM, c0M = 10 mM, c0P = 1000 mM (with the latter kept at the standard concentration, to account for unity activity of the solid sacrificial electrode employed in our previous9 experimental work), c0S = 5 mM, I0 = 100 μeinstein m−2 s−1 (corresponding to 2.39 mW cm−2), ε = 15000 M−1 cm−1,  = 1.0 mm, D = 10−7 cm2 s−1, and with fast homogeneous kinetics occurring close to the Smoluchowski diffusion limit for the case of second-order process, so that assessments are not limited by the rate electron transfer to the supersensitiser, viz., k1 = 1010 M−1 s−1, k2 = 5 × 107 s−1.
2.4 Computing
Numerical solution proceeded through the Backward Implicit method, rather than employing the Crank–Nicholson approach, owing to the greater stability of the former, with dense spatio-temporal grids so that numerical convergence of the resulting concentration profiles occurred, for greater accuracy of the simulation. Typical grids employed 20000 spatial nodes, and 50000 temporal nodes; simulations were undertaken through program encoding in GNU FORTRAN using the freely available G77 compiler, and were executed on an Intel Pentium processor (of speed, 2.4 GHz, with 1.98 GB of random access memory). Single charge/discharge experiments involving ca. 500 trillion calculations typically took just over 24 min of CPU time.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Performance as a solar-rechargeable battery

Fig. 2a illustrates charge/discharge curves obtained for typical experimental parameters (see legend), when the cell is charged for 20 s with light, and discharged at a constant current in the dark immediately. We observe that the energy conversion efficiency is rather small (q.v.Fig. 2b) – this does increase as the applied current density decreases below 100 μA cm−2, but this requires discharge times greater than the 20 s maximum we have imposed.
 Fig. 2  (a) Performance characteristics of the idealised model as a light-chargeable battery, in which the initial concentration of species A was 15 mM and species B was 0.0 mM. The cell is charged with light (I0 = 100 μeinstein m−2 s−1) in the first 20 s under open circuit conditions, and discharged galvanostatically in the second 20 s with current densities of 1.0 (blue), 2.0 (red) and 4.0 (black) A m−2. All other parameters were kept as given in the text. (b) Variation of the energy conversion efficiency (red squares) and power conversion efficiency (blue circles) with the discharge current density for the system in (a). 
As anticipated, the power conversion efficiency follows the opposite trend, and increases with discharge current density. This essentially verifies our previous inference9 that these systems may, at best, act merely as a mid-ranging,18 photo-rechargeable electrochemical capacitor, rather than a battery per se: for discharge under constant current density of 100 μA cm−2, the system exhibits a specific energy density of ca. 0.5 W h kg−1 and specific power density close to 2 W kg−1, when a cell thickness of 1.0 mm is employed, assuming that the phase density is approximately 1.0 g cm−3; as the cell becomes thinner, these specific performance data increase: when the cell thickness is approximately equal to the Nernst diffusion length of the cell, viz., we observe that the power density becomes 70 W kg−1 with energy density of 20 W h kg−1. Thin cells then become attractive and useful as power sources for portable equipment/medical devices,18,19 in line with our previous conclusions,9 albeit using normalisation through the mass of the phase, rather than the mass of the electroactive reagents.19
We next examine the performance of the device as a solar cell.
3.2 Performance as a solar cell

Fig. 3a depicts galvanostatic discharge curves for the cell under various states of initial charge in the presence and absence of light. In the dark, these curves follow the expected shape at all current densities (Fig. 3a(i)).
However, in the presence of light (Fig. 3a(ii)), even as weak as 1.0 μeinstein m−2 s−1, under small current drain (corresponding to low load), the cell potential may increase – a consequence of the more rapid formation of B compared with its consumption; the regenerative rate competes with the drain rate. Such effects are most dramatic for the highest states-of-charge of the system. This leads to these states being the most efficient for the direct generation of power from incident light (see Fig. 3b, c and Table 1), with the maximum PCE observed to be close to 7%. For the system probed, it is clear that the optimum load affords a maximum power of around 160 μW cm−2 for light of intensity 100 μeinstein m−2 s−1.

These plots were constructed through simulating the temporal discharge characteristic at constant current density, followed by variation of the latter.

It is notable that if the concentration of the supersensitizer is increased (q.v.Table 1) by an order of magnitude (an entirely experimentally reasonable scenario), the PCE under monochromatic conditions at 0.5 mA cm−2increases to ca. 30%, highlighting the potential of this approach as a viable, pragmatic, semiconductor-free light-to-electrical energy conversion system.
In this respect, we examined the performance of the system under air-mass 2.0 (AM 2.0) solar radiation conditions (of total irradiance 749 W m−2, and corresponding to a sun elevation angle of 30°), under which the molar flux of green (500 nm) photons is (ref. 7) 420 μeinstein m−2 s−1. It is clear from the data provided in Table 1 that, as expected, as the photon flux increases, so does the current under which the cell may be effectively drained, with a maximum PCE under these conditions of 4.5% at a current density of 2.0 mA cm−2, giving rise to a power density of 3.4 mW cm−2, with a supersensitizer concentrations of 0.1 M (an order of magnitude smaller than that employed as the redox electrolyte within dye-sensitized solar cells).
The fact that this PCE approaches the 5% anticipated by Albery and Archer7a under this type of illumination for a conventional PG device is not surprising – the supersensitizer concentration is high and its regenerative kinetics are fast, essentially causing all second-order reactions in which it is involved to be pseudo-first-order; our spatially-separated, single phase system then effectively becomes equivalent to the conventional molecular PG system, even though there are fundamental differences in the underlying chemistries.
4. Conclusions
In this work we have developed a finite difference computational model for the simulation of a regenerative photogalvanic cell. Unlike other models,6,7 this system is capable of affording a temporal-dependent response. For the realistic and experimentally plausible reaction constraints of electrochemically reversible electrode kinetics, diffusion-controlled photo-redox catalysis with no reactant cross-over, such cells behave as middle-of-the-range electrochemical capacitors, with a power conversion efficiency that is dependent on the supersensitiser concentration, with 4.5% power conversion under AM 2.0 conditions when the supersensitiser is photoexcited in green light.
The underlying benefits of this model, semiconductor-free, molecular solar cell20 include its inherent lower environmental toxicity cf. semiconductor-based devices, its potential low cost and ease of manufacture/assembly,21 even with embedded electron transfer cascades,22,23 and its ability to store energy.9
Appendix: an undecadiagonal matrix algorithm
Consider the attempt of the solution of N simultaneous equations which may be written in the form  where the vectors {u} and {y} represent unknown and known quantities, respectively, and [T] is a matrix of known coefficients, such that it may be expressed as follows.  
The solution proceeds through LU decomposition of the 11-diagonal matrix into two triangular matrices. Hence, defining the following parameters through forward recursion, as appropriate,  and i = 6 → N,  
It then follows that the following vector {x} can be deduced from the lower triangular matrix.x1 = y1; x2 = y2 − z2x1; x3 = y3 − α3x1 − z3x2; x4 = y4 − β4x1 − α4x2 − z4x3; x5 = y5 − γ5x1 − β5x2 − α5x3 − z5x4;i = 6 → N: xi = yi − εixi−5 − γixi−4 − βixi−3 − αixi−2 − zixi−1
These calculations then engender the computation of the unknown vector {u} from the upper triangular matrix, using backward recursion, as appropriate.  i = N − 5 → 1

 	Fig. 2  (a) Performance characteristics of the idealised model as a light-chargeable battery, in which the initial concentration of species A was 15 mM and species B was 0.0 mM. The cell is charged with light (I0 = 100 μeinstein m−2 s−1) in the first 20 s under open circuit conditions, and discharged galvanostatically in the second 20 s with current densities of 1.0 (blue), 2.0 (red) and 4.0 (black) A m−2. All other parameters were kept as given in the text. (b) Variation of the energy conversion efficiency (red squares) and power conversion efficiency (blue circles) with the discharge current density for the system in (a).	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Performance characteristics of the model system for the case when c0A = 2.0 mM and c0B = 13.0 mM acting as a solar cell with light intensity of (i) 0.0 and (ii) 100 μeinstein m−2 s−1, all other experimental parameters as given in the text. These plots were constructed through simulating the temporal discharge characteristic at constant current density, followed by variation of the latter. (b) Variation of the PCE of the system in (a) with initial composition of the cell and discharge current density. (c) Variation of the maximum PCE with initial composition of the cell. The blue circles represent the values obtained through simulation; the red line fits to  with a Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient of 0.993.
