    , Accepted 2nd January 2019First published on 16th January 2019AbstractAccelerating inorganic nanocrystal-based photovoltaic technology needs more efficient synthetic protocols for large scale manufacture, high yield and excellent quality nanocrystal materials. We, for the first time, investigated the highly concentrated synthesis of PbS quantum dots (QDs) and systematically explored their properties and photovoltaic performance. We revealed that the precursor concentration can be scaled up from 0.079 M to 15.8 M (200-fold) while excellent nanocrystal quality is maintained. We found that the size, size distribution, optical properties, and composition of the PbS QDs synthesized with various concentrations show negligible difference. As a result, all the solar cells based on these PbS QDs show excellent performance with stable efficiency in the range of 10% to 10.5%. And the results from carrier recombination, trap density and carrier concentration measurements are consistent with the corresponding photovoltaic performance. More importantly, we proved that the highly concentrated synthesis is a general approach that can be applied to different lead precursors. Thus our approach can successfully provide large-scale production of high quality PbS QDs, providing insights into future large-scale manufacturing of QD solar cells.
1. Introduction
Colloidal lead chalcogenide nanocrystals possess advantages like large exciton Bohr radius,1,2 size-tunable bandgap,3 multiple exciton generation4–11 and strong quantum confinement effects.1,12 Their superior properties have attracted tremendous attention in the field of optoelectronic devices,13–16 especially photovoltaic (PV)17–21 devices, which are regarded as the most promising renewable power sources. Lead sulfide (PbS) QD solar cells are upcoming new players and have now become attractive frontrunners in the field of third-generation photovoltaics.22–25 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have increased rapidly up to 12%26 and PbS QD solar cells show unprecedented stability during long periods of storage time.27 Despite the fast advance in QD photovoltaic technology, currently one big obstacle to its large scale commercialization is the relatively low production of QDs, which is also a challenge in the field of nanocrystal synthesis. The toxicity of the heavy metal component is another factor that limits their large-scale commercial prospects. One approach to this challenge is to encapsulate and recycle such solar cell devices to largely reduce the possible pollution. The other way is to design and synthesize efficient lead-free photovoltaic nanocrystals.28,29
High quality nanocrystal synthesis at a large-scale is the core step of nanocrystal development. In addition, from the perspective of optoelectronic application, it is highly desirable to invent simple and highly reproducible methods to obtain high quality nanocrystals with an ideal size distribution and in sufficient amount. In the lab-scale synthesis, hot-injection protocols are mainly used for producing monodisperse QDs.30,31 Among these synthetic methods, precursors are rapidly injected at certain temperatures and then reacted for a usually short duration (<10 min).32–34 This approach has played a significant role in advancing nanomaterials science by providing universal access to a broad library of nanocrystal materials, as well as size, shape and composition optimization.35–37 However, one of the major bottlenecks that hamper the hot injection protocols for commercialization purpose is the relatively small-scale reactions (roughly <100 mg yield).38,39 Along this important direction, many efforts in the field of nanocrystals have been dedicated to achieve an economical synthesis at an enhanced scale that could produce high-quality nanocrystals with high yields. Among them, expanding the volume of the reaction is a widely adopted method to increase the yields. Zhang et al. reported the in situ halide passivation method to produce PbS QDs at a yield of 47 grams (g) in a 2 liter (L) flask.40 Yarema et al. described an improved hot-injection method utilizing atmospheric pressure to produce PbS QDs at a yield of 17.2 g.41 One major obstacle for these methods is the stringent requirements for the synthetic reaction. On the other hand, the concentration intensification method has been recently reported by Williamson et al. for the synthesis of Cu2−xS nanocrystals.42 This method normally heats the reaction mixture with a previously unexplored high concentration near the solubility limit of the precursors, which demonstrates a 10 to 1000-fold increase in nanocrystal production. However, all these previous efforts are only focused on the increase of nanocrystal production, whereas the quality of the scale-up synthetic nanocrystals and their resultant device applications have rarely been investigated. Moreover, as a ubiquitous and superstar nanocrystal for QD solar cell application, there have been few efforts in studying the concentration intensification synthesis of PbS QDs.42 Therefore, further optimization of PbS QD synthesis together with characterisation of the resultant photovoltaic properties would be extremely important, in order to accelerate the commercialization step of the emerging QD PV technology.
In this contribution, we reported the concentration intensification synthesis of PbS QDs at a wide PbO precursor concentration: 0.079 M (1-fold), 0.395 M (5-fold), 0.79 M (10-fold), 1.58 M (20-fold), 2.37 M (30-fold), 3.95 M (50-fold), 7.9 M (100-fold) and 15.8 M (200-fold) using the classical hot-injection method. We investigated the relationship between the QD size and the reaction temperatures based on eight parallel control reactions; we found that the absorption peaks of PbS QDs (related to the size of QDs) synthesized at different precursor concentrations are almost linearly related to the reaction temperature. In order to eliminate the variation in the PV performance caused by the QD size effect, we optimized the reaction temperature and time for each concentration. And the sizes of the resultant QDs are nearly indistinguishable, which is also further proved by the absorption, photoluminescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. Finally, the solar cells based on these PbS QDs show similar performance despite the different precursor concentrations. Additionally, we further extended the investigation using lead acetate instead of lead oxide as the lead precursor based on our recent work.24 Interestingly, the results exhibit a similar trend but with the solar cell efficiency improved to ∼10.5%, which indicated the universality of our synthesis approach. We believe these results will be valuable when considering large-scale fabrication of efficient QD solar cells.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials and instruments
Lead(II) oxide (PbO) (99.9%, Alfa), lead(II) acetate trihydrate (Pb(OOCCH3)2·3H2O) (99.9%, Alfa), 1-octadecene (ODE) (tech. grade, 90%, J&K), oleic acid (OA) (tech. grade, 90%, Alfa), bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide [(TMS)2S] (98%, J&K), hexane (95%, J&K), acetone (99.5%, J&K), isopropanol (95%, J&K), tetra-n-butylammonium iodide (TBAI) (98%, Alfa), 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) (98.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), acetonitrile (99%, Alfa), and methanol (99%, Alfa). All the chemicals are used as received. The UV-Vis-NIR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer model Lambda 750. The morphologies of PbS QDs were characterized using TEM (Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin transmission electron microscope). The TEM samples were prepared by drop casting on copper grids with a carbon membrane. The time-resolved PL spectra were detected using a Hamamatsu streak camera with a cathode sensitive to near-IR radiation.
2.2 Synthesis of PbS nanocrystals
The synthesis of PbS nanocrystals was performed under an inert atmosphere using a typical vacuum device. The method of synthesis followed a reported protocol,43 with a molar ratio of OA:PbO/PbAc2·3H2O:(TMS)2S = 5:2:1. In a 50 mL three-necked flask with a condenser and a stirring bar, PbO/PbAc2·3H2O and OA were mixed in ODE solvent with a specific Pb concentration (0.079–19.8 M). The detailed reaction quantities are provided in Table S1 (ESI†). The mixture was degassed and heated up to 100 °C and vacuumed for 2 h to dry the solution and obtain lead oleate. The solution was further cooled down or heated up to the required reaction temperature and (TMS)2S in ODE (4 mL) was swiftly injected into the flask with vigorous stirring under dry nitrogen. The reaction mixture was kept at this temperature for the corresponding reaction time and then quenched by pouring twice the volume of anhydrous isopropanol into the mixture under N2 protection. The products were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min and then redissolved in anhydrous hexanes (10 mL). The PbS QDs were collected by flocculating the materials with a mixture of acetone and hexanes (1:1) and centrifuging once at 8000 rpm for 5 min. The QDs were dried under a stream of nitrogen and then dissolved in hexanes for photophysical characterization. It is worth mentioning that the synthesis procedure of PbS is identical when using PbO or PbAc2 as the lead precursor.
2.3 Photovoltaic device fabrication and characterization
PbS nanocrystal solar cells were fabricated on an ITO coated glass substrate. Immediately prior to device fabrication, the ITO glass was cleaned using ultrasonic baths of organic solvents (acetone and isopropanol) and UV-ozone treatment for 15 min. A 40 mg mL−1 solution of PbS in hexanes was used to prepare the active layer. In this work, we employed ITO/ZnO/PbS-TBAI/PbS-EDT/Au as the device structure and used TBAI and EDT as the exchange ligands to replace OA and bridge the nanocrystals. Each nanocrystal layer was fabricated via layer-by-layer spin-coating at 2500 rpm for 10 s. Solid-state ligand exchange was performed by soaking the film in a TBAI solution (10 mg mL−1 in methanol) or an EDT solution (0.04 vol% in acetonitrile) for 30 s, followed by two rinse-spin steps with acetonitrile. This process was repeated until the desired thicknesses were obtained. Then the films were stored in air overnight at a humidity of 15%. Finally, 100 nm of Au was thermally evaporated on top of the nanocrystal layer through shadow masks (active area 0.0725 cm2) at a base pressure of 10−6 mbar. The current density–voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 (I–V) digital source meter under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). The light intensity is calibrated using a certified Oriel Reference Cell (91150V) and verified using a NREL calibrated Hamamatsu S1787-04 diode. The capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were performed using a precision impedance analyzer 6500B series.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Highly concentrated synthesis of PbS QDs
As illustrated in Fig. 1a, PbS QDs are synthesized under a nitrogen atmosphere via the classical standard Schlenk line techniques, adopting a widely reported protocol in this field: ODE as the noncoordinating solvent, OA as the ligand, PbO as the lead source and (TMS)2S as the sulfur source. Herein, we expand the PbO precursor concentrations from the conventional 0.079 M up to 19.8 M (250-fold) (details can be found in Table S1, ESI†). First of all, we need to know the precursor concentration window for controllable synthesis. We found that when the concentration was higher than 15.8 M (200-fold), a large amount of black precipitates appeared immediately after the injection of (TMS)2S (Fig. S1a, ESI†), hindering the further formation of PbS QDs. We hypothesize that these precipitates are the strongly aggregated PbS nanocrystals, which are overgrown due to the limited formation of nuclei and highly concentrated reaction mixture. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were further performed. As shown in Fig. S1b (ESI†), the peak positions of the black precipitates and regular PbS QDs are almost identical. However the black precipitates exhibit a significant increase in peak intensity, indicating the growth and increase of the crystallite size.44 A similar trend can also be found in the TEM characterizations (Fig. S1c, ESI†). Therefore, we revealed that the upper limit of the lead precursor concentration in our highly concentrated synthesis was around 200-fold relative to the conventional ones (0.079 M). Then we tried to study the evolution of QD sizes at different precursor concentrations, since the QD sizes are directly related to their photovoltaic performance. In general, the QD size is closely related to the reaction temperatures. Therefore, we further investigated the relationship between the reaction temperature and the QD size at eight different precursor concentrations. We varied the reaction temperature from 60 °C to 140 °C to study the evolution of the QD sizes. It was worth noting that in the reaction system with a precursor concentration higher than 3.95 M (50-fold), the relatively high viscosity of the reaction mixture required a minimum reaction temperature of 100 °C, as the viscous system greatly hindered the injection process of (TMS)2S at lower temperature. Thus for the 50, 100, and 200-fold synthesis, the studied temperature ranges are changed to 100–180 °C. As shown in Fig. 1b and c, the first excitation peak of synthesized PbS QDs at different precursor concentrations exhibits almost a linear dependence as a function of reaction temperature. Quite interestingly, as the precursor concentration increases in the reaction system, the slope gradually decreases: slope = 2.9 (0.079 M), 2.6 (0.395 M), 2.5 (0.79 M), 2.3 (1.58 M), 2.1 (2.37 M), 1.4 (3.95 M), 1.1 (7.9 M) and 0.9 (15.8 M). All these results indicated that the reaction equilibrium sensitivity of our highly concentrated system was improved compared to the conventional synthesis at low precursor concentrations. A similar trend can be found in a previous report.42 Experiments showed that the heat capacity was related to the nanoparticle concentration.45–47 Higher precursor concentration increased the heat capacity and viscosity (μ) of the solution. And on the other hand, the viscosity could be translated to mass diffusivity (D) using the Stokes–Einstein–Sutherland equation (i.e., D = kBT/6πμr) for nanoparticles with hydrodynamic radius r.42 Therefore, the diffusivity in the highly concentrated condition was lower than that under conventional conditions. High heat capacity and low mass diffusion resulted in better reaction equilibrium sensitivity of the highly concentrated system. In summary, we reveal that the PbO precursor concentration window for the highly concentrated synthesis of PbS QD is from 0.079 M to 15.8 M (200-fold). The reaction will not be controllable at a higher precursor concentration. At different precursor concentrations, the QD sizes all follow a linear relationship with the reaction temperature, while the slope decreases with increasing temperature. We conclude that the reaction equilibrium sensitivity of the highly concentrated system was improved compared to the conventional condition.

3.2 Size control and yield of PbS in highly concentrated synthesis
In order to further investigate the photovoltaic performance and eliminate the variation in the device performance caused by the QD size effect, we chose the PbS QD with the first excitonic peak at ∼860 nm, which has been previously reported as the ideal PbS QD for solar cell applications.24,48 As indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 1b and c, the corresponding reaction temperatures to synthesize 860 nm PbS QDs in the eight different systems can be obtained, which are gradually increased with higher precursor concentrations (Table S2, ESI†). We observed that the QD sizes are sensitive to both reaction temperature and precursor concentration. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), with low precursor concentration, the QD absorption peak can be fixed for a relatively long time, indicating a stable “size focusing” stage. In contrast, with an increased precursor concentration and reaction temperature, this “size focusing” time becomes shorter. At high concentration and temperature, the absorption peak as well as QD sizes will change rapidly with the reaction time, attributed to Ostwald ripening.49–51 Thus the reaction time is controlled to be shorter in higher concentration synthesis (see Table S2, ESI†) to allow fair comparison of the dependence of QD size on precursor concentration as well as temperature.
The reaction yield is a critical issue in large-scale synthesis to obtain high-quality nanocrystals in an efficient and economical way. However, the surface of PbS QDs is protected by oleic acid ligands,52 and it is difficult to calculate the exact molar mass of the Pb, which makes it hard to calculate the conventional reaction yield. In order to make a reasonable comparison of our highly concentrated system, here, we defined the reaction yield by a parameter , where k1 is the weight of the output PbS and k2 is the weight of the input PbO. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), in comparison with the conventional system (0.079 M), the yield of the highly concentrated system gradually increases, with the peak value appearing in the 2.37 M system. After that the yield slightly decreases but is still comparable to that of the conventional system. We hypothesize that the increased yield may be due to the increasing concentration of the precursor which leads to fast nucleation with the formation of more nuclei. Similar results can also be found in the previous report.36 When the monomer concentration increases, the number of nuclei will also increase, resulting in an increased quantity of nanocrystals. Meanwhile, with the formation of more nuclei, fewer monomers are left for QD growth and the sizes of the synthesized QDs are smaller at the same reaction temperatures. The slightly decreased yield in the highly concentrated system may be due to the aforementioned increased viscosity. Due to the high viscosity of the precursor solution, the initially injected (TMS)2S solution cannot quickly disperse and uniformly mix with lead oleate, which leads to the formation of a lower number of nuclei.42,53
3.3 Properties of PbS in highly concentrated synthesis
In order to confirm the size and distribution of the obtained QDs, a series of essential characterizations were further performed. The optical properties, size and size distribution of these QDs need to be carefully characterized before subjecting to further solar cell investigation. As shown in Fig. 2a, the UV-Vis absorption spectrumof the desired PbS QDs synthesized at eight different precursor concentrations exhibits almost no appreciable differences in the peak position (∼860 nm). Meantime, very similar photoluminescence spectra were obtained and are shown in Fig. 2b. Then the dynamic PL lifetime of these PbS QDs in hexane solution was measured using Time-Resolved Photoluminescence (TRPL), as shown in Fig. 2c, with the calculated lifetime value listed in Fig. 2d. Since the QD PL lifetime is directly related to the surface trap states, the similar decay curves and lifetime values for all PbS QDs indicate that the difference in the surface condition for all these QDs is almost negligible. In order to obtain an in-depth understanding of the properties of the QDs synthesized at different precursor concentrations, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of their absorption and PL peaks was calculated according to the previously reported method (Fig. S4, ESI†),54 which is an intuitive parameter that can reflect the size distribution of the nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 2d, the FWHM values of both absorption and photoluminescence peaks of QDs exhibit small variations with the synthesis condition. However, no apparent ascending or descending trend can be observed, indicating that the QDs synthesized with different precursor concentrations can achieve an analogous size distribution compared to those obtained under the conventional condition.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was further used to confirm the size and distribution of the synthesized nanocrystals. As shown in Fig. 3, the morphology of the PbS QDs obtained from different precursor concentrations does not show a significant difference, and all these QDs exhibit a relatively small size around 3.1 nm. In addition, the corresponding size histograms were computed to gain insight into the size distribution of these PbS QDs. The size distribution of different systems is not exactly the same. However, we don’t observe an increased size range for QDs synthesized at higher concentrations. In short, the TEM results are consistent with the absorption and photoluminescence characterization, indicating that the nanoparticle size and distribution can be maintained well in our highly concentrated PbS synthesis.
 Fig. 3  (a–h) TEM images of the PbS QDs synthesized with increasing concentrations. 
The QD composition and crystal structure are also important factors for determining the properties of nanocrystals. In order to simplify the comparison, we select four samples (control, 20-fold, 100-fold and 200-fold) to study the change in crystal structure and S/Pb ratio. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the QDs synthesized at different concentrations are almost identical; all these samples exhibit exactly the same peak position and similar FWHM values, indicating a similar crystal structure and size of these QDs. Subsequently, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results (Fig. S6, ESI†) reveal that the S/Pb ratios of these PbS QDs are 0.70 (0.079 M), 0.71 (1.58 M), 0.66 (7.9 M), and 0.68 (15.8 M). The S/Pb ratio of different QDs shows only a small variation, which we believe is within the margin of measurement error. All these results demonstrate that increasing the precursor concentration from 0.079 M to 15.8 M (200-fold) will not significantly influence the size, crystal structure and surface composition of the resultant PbS QDs.
3.4 Photovoltaic performance of PbS obtained in highly concentrated synthesis
The previously reported scale-up synthesis usually focused on increasing the NC yields, while the device performance of the resultant NCs has rarely been investigated. In order to explore the possible balance between NCs’ quantity and quality, we seek to compare the photovoltaic performance of QDs synthesized with different concentrations, by adopting a widely used device structure of ITO/ZnO/PbS-TBAI/PbS-EDT/Au. As shown in Fig. 4a, we introduce ZnO nanoparticles as the electron extracting layer, TBAI treated PbS (PbS-TBAI) as the active layer,52,55 EDT treated PbS (PbS-EDT) as the hole transporting layer52 and gold as the top anode. The thicknesses of each constituent layer of the device are measured to be 80 nm, 200 nm, 40 nm and 100 nm for ZnO, PbS-TBAI, PbS-EDT and Au, respectively (Fig. 4b). The solar cell devices were fabricated according to the widely used protocols.24,48 We only change the PbS QDs to investigate the effect of precursor concentration on the solar cell performance. To ensure the reproducibility of the results, six devices were fabricated and tested for each condition. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PbS QDs prepared from different precursor concentrations are measured under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination, as shown in Fig. 4c and d. The relevant photovoltaic parameters are provided in Table 1 and Fig. 5. The VOC, JSC and FF of the devices using PbS QDs prepared from the conventional concentration (0.079 M) is 0.57 V, 22.99 mA cm−2 and 63.49%, respectively, resulting in a best PCE of 8.32%. Increasing the precursor concentrations to 5-fold and 10-fold slightly enhances JSC and FF, leading to a best PCE of 8.83% and 8.72%, respectively. On further increasing the precursor concentrations to 20-fold, 30-fold and 40-fold, all these solar cell devices exhibit a similar PCE around 8.4%, which is comparable to that of the control device. And the PCEs of the resultant device start to decrease slightly when the concentration reaches 100-fold (7.9 M) and 200-fold (15.8 M), with a best efficiency of 8.25% and 8.16% respectively. Nonetheless, these efficiencies are decreased only by ∼2% in comparison to the PCE of 8.32% for the control device, which can be neglected. In summary, all these results demonstrate that PbS QDs prepared at different precursor concentrations (1–200 fold) exhibit comparable solar cell performance. Quite recently, we reported that the selection of different lead precursors in synthesis had a significant impact on the resultant CQD solar cell performance.24 We found that upon using lead acetate instead of conventional lead oxide as the lead precursor, the synthesized PbS QDs exhibit fewer trap states, and show improved efficiency compared with PbO based QDs. In order to investigate the universality of this highly concentrated synthesis method, we conducted the same study by changing the lead precursor source from lead oxide to lead acetate. The relevant photovoltaic parameters for the corresponding PbS CQD solar cells are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 5. Apparently, the new lead precursor is also compatible with the highly concentrated synthesis method, and similar conclusions can be made. As shown in Table 1, PbS CQD solar cells exhibit best PCEs of 10.02%, 10.45%, 10.43%, 10.08%, 10.05%, 10.17%, 10.03% and 10.00% for different concentrated systems. These values are significantly improved compared to the PbO precursor based systems. Nonetheless, both systems show stable device performance in a wide range of precursor concentrations, indicating that the highly concentrated synthesis may become a universal approach to provide high quality photovoltaic CQD materials for future practical device fabrication.

 Fig. 5  Optimized photovoltaic parameters of the PbS QD solar cell as a function of different precursor types and concentrations. 
To further confirm the device performance by probing the device charge dynamics, we investigated the variation of JSC and VOC as a function of the illumination intensity. Then we can gain insight into the charge recombination in these devices. The power law dependence of JSC upon the illumination intensity can generally be expressed as JSC ∝ Iα, where I is the light intensity and α is the exponential factor.56 The values of the exponential factor (α) of the device made from four different precursor concentrations are found to be close to unity (Fig. 6a), indicating that all these devices show very little bimolecular recombination under short-circuit conditions. In VOC-light intensity dependence measurements, the VOC should follow a power law relationship as VOC ∼ sI, where s > 1.0kT/q is indicative of significant trap-assisted recombination.56 As shown in Fig. 6b, the value s is determined to be 1.42kT/q (0.079 M), 1.48kT/q (1.58 M), 1.45kT/q (7.9 M), and 1.45kT/q (15.8 M). Therefore, both VOC and JSC-light intensity measurements exhibit a similar trend for PbS QDs prepared at different precursor concentrations (1–200 fold), indicating analogous surface condition and charge recombination.

Since charge recombination in QD solar cells is largely determined by the QD trap states. We investigated the trap density of the TBAI exchanged PbS QD films through the SCLC method (see Fig. S7, ESI†),26 and the results are shown in Fig. 6c. The trap density of PbS QDs synthesized under different conditions can be calculated to be 1.7 × 1017 cm−3 (0.079 M), 1.6 × 1017 cm−3 (0.395 M), 1.8 × 1017 cm−3 (0.79 M), 1.7 × 1017 cm−3 (1.58 M), 1.86 × 1017 cm−3 (2.37 M), 1.75 × 1017 cm−3 (3.95 M), 1.9 × 1017 cm−3 (7.9 M) and 1.86 × 1017 cm−3 (15.8 M). These values are very similar to and consistent with the reported values in efficient PbS QDs.24,57 In addition, the similar trap density confirms the aforementioned results in carrier recombination and device performance. Finally, the carrier concentrations were also investigated by capacitance–voltage (C–V) analysis.58,59 The calculated carrier concentration Nd is plotted in Fig. 6d, again, showing similar values. All these results indicate that the carrier concentration, trap density and charge recombination in these PbS QDs are similar despite the different precursor concentrations, which are important for achieving comparable solar cell efficiencies. Considering the significantly enhanced QD production and high photovoltaic performance maintained, we believe our highly concentrated synthetic approach can provide PbS QDs with both excellent quantity and quality.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we, for the first time, investigated the highly concentrated synthesis of PbS QDs and systematically explored their properties and photovoltaic performance. We reveal that the precursor concentration can be scaled up from 0.079 M to 15.8 M (200-fold) while excellent nanocrystal quality is maintained. We found that the size, size distribution, optical properties, and composition of the PbS QDs synthesized with various concentrations show negligible difference. As a result, the solar cells based on these PbS QDs show excellent performance with stable efficiency in the range of 10% to 10.5%. And the results from carrier recombination, trap density and carrier concentration measurements are consistent with the corresponding photovoltaic performance. More importantly, we proved that the highly concentrated synthesis can be a general approach for different lead precursors. Our approach can afford large production of high quality PbS QDs, paving the way for the future large-scale manufacturing of QD solar cells.
