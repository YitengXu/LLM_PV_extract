    , Accepted 7th October 2019First published on 11th October 2019AbstractStainless steel (SS) foil is made of abundant materials and is a durable and flexible substrate, but the efficiency of a solar cell on SS foil deteriorates via the diffusion of impurities from the SS substrate into a Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) absorber layer. In this work, the properties of the diffusion barrier for CZTSSe solar cells is investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The industrially relevant oxide materials ZnO and SiO2 are used as diffusion barriers against impurities. The formation of a ZnSe reaction with Se degrades the barrier properties of the ZnO barrier layer. As a result, ZnO fails to act as a diffusion barrier, and Fe is observed in the absorber layer. On the other hand, the intrinsic diffusion barrier properties of SiO2 are superior to those of ZnO, and SiO2 is a stable diffusion barrier even after selenization. Therefore, SiO2 was applied to flexible solar cells, and a power conversion efficiency of 10.30%, the highest efficiency for CZTSSe on SS foil, was obtained.
Introduction
Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin-film solar cells have attracted attention because they are composed of earth-abundant materials and are a low-cost flexible photovoltaic (PV) technology.1–3 CZTSSe solar cells on flexible substrates can be applied to new fields, such as building-integrated photovoltaics and flexible electronics, because of their light weight and flexibility.4–9 However, a reduction in power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to that for a rigid substrate is a disadvantage of solar cells on flexible substrates.10–19 CZTSSe cells are produced using nanocrystal-based ink and roll-to-roll printing solution-based methods to produce CZTSSe Al foils (1.94%)12 and flexible glass substrates (6.9%).13 Concerning vacuum-based methods, sputter deposition is used to produce CZTSSe solar cells on polyimide (PI) substrates (4.9%),14 Mo foil (10.34%)15 and stainless steel (SS) substrates (6.29%).16 Thus, there is a difference between the PCE of CZTSSe flexible solar cells and that of CZTSSe cells on a soda lime glass (SLG) rigid substrate (12.6%).17,18
SS foil is composed of abundant materials and is a durable and flexible substrate,16,19 but impurities diffuse from the SS foil, which reduces the efficiency.20–23 Consequently, the prevention of impurity diffusion is required for solar cells on SS foil substrates. To prevent impurity diffusion, metal (Cr20,23 and Ti16,24), oxide (SiO2,25–27 ZnO,27–30 and Al2O3 (ref. 31–33)) and nitride (TiN and Si3N4)34 diffusion barrier layers have been used for CZTSSe and CuInxGa(1−x)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells on SS foil substrates. In particular, CIGS solar cells on SS foil substrates demonstrated a PCE of 17.7%,35 which is a higher efficiency than that of CZTSSe solar cells but is lower than that of CIGS on a PI substrate (20.8%)36 or SLG rigid substrate (23.35%).37 This is because the process temperature is low to avoid impurity diffusion,34 as diffusion barriers are ineffective.22 In previous studies, even if the same material is used as a diffusion barrier, the result may vary depending on the heat treatment time,38 temperature,35 distribution of the grain boundaries39 and thickness of the barrier material.29 In particular, since the grain boundaries have a higher diffusion coefficient than does the bulk,40 crystalline or amorphous phases, which do and do not have grain boundaries, respectively, affect the diffusion. Moreover, because the absorber layer in CZTSSe and CIGS solar cells has to undergo high-temperature heat treatment, the temperature tolerance of the diffusion barrier is an important factor in these solar cell devices. Furthermore, it is shown herein that because the CZTSSe solar cell needs heat treatment in a S or Se atmosphere, degradation of the diffusion barrier performance due to reaction with S and Se and impurities from the SS foil must be considered. To confirm the reliability and stability, as well as to prevent increases in production costs due to an excessively thick barrier layer, it is important to reveal what leads to poor performance of the diffusion barrier. Thus, although various materials have been used as barriers in the study of CZTSSe and CIGS solar cells on SS foil substrates, a detailed understanding of the diffusion barrier properties of the materials is required.
In this research, industrially relevant oxide materials, ZnO and SiO2, are used as diffusion barriers against impurities from the SS foil. ZnO is a fundamental material used in the window layer in kesterite solar cells.29,30 Therefore, additional investment due to the diffusion barrier processes is not necessary. SiO2 is a well-known diffusion barrier and is easy to use in commercial manufacturing.27,38,41 Through experiments that use harsh conditions, the factors influencing diffusion barrier properties are determined, and it is found that the barrier ability is weakened by reactions between the barrier material and the chalcogens. The diffusion of impurities into the absorber layer is observed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Then, SiO2 is chosen after considering the factors required for a diffusion barrier for a CZTSSe solar cell. The NaF layer, which is well known to improve the performance of CZTSSe solar cells,42 was deposited on the Mo layer before the precursor layer. Consequently, a PCE of 10.30%, the highest efficiency observed so far for a flexible CZTSSe solar cell on SS foil, is obtained.
Experimental section
Barrier property investigation
The SiO2 and ZnO diffusion barrier films were prepared on 430 SS (Fe ≤ 82 at%, Cr 16–18 at%, Mn ≤ 1.0%, Si ≤ 1.0%) foils. The 500 nm SiO2 and 500 nm ZnO films were fabricated by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) and radio frequency (RF) sputtering, respectively. The 500 nm molybdenum layer was deposited by sputtering on SS foils with SiO2 or ZnO barriers or without a barrier. A furnace with an Ar atmosphere was used for high-temperature treatments. The sample of the SS foil with (diffusion barrier (SiO2 or ZnO)) or without a barrier/Mo structure was annealed at 800 °C for 1 hour. For harsh conditions in a Se atmosphere, diffusion barrier-exposed films (SiO2 or ZnO on SS foil) were annealed in a furnace in a Se atmosphere at 550 °C for 30 min. Only Se was used to clearly analyze the crystalline phase in the XRD. NaF (10 nm) was deposited on the Mo layer before the precursor using thermal evaporation in the all sample. Works on an optimization of the thickness of the NaF layer is not covered in this paper, since it has been reported by other researchers.33,43 To fabricate the absorber layer, the precursor metal films were prepared on SS foil with (diffusion barrier (SiO2, ZnO)) or without a barrier/Mo as a stacked tri-layer (Zn/Cu/Sn). To fabricate high-efficiency solar cells, rapid thermal processing (RTP) was used to fabricate the absorber layer. The precursor sample of the SS foil/diffusion barrier (without a barrier or with ZnO or SiO2)/Mo (500 nm)/NaF (10 nm)/Zn/Cu/Sn was placed in an annealing jig consisting of a quartz boat and cover plate in a sample holder made of SiC-coated graphite. For the sulfo-selenization process, a boat made of quartz loaded with Se (250 mg) was placed in an annealing jig. H2S (250 sccm) and Ar (2000 sccm) gas was supplied to the RTP in preparation stage of annealing until the chamber pressure reached 700 Torr. When the pres-sure reached 700 Torr, all gas supply was stopped, and the heating process was performed. The sample was heated at a heating rate of 30 °C min−1 from room temperature to 300 °C and then held at 300 °C for 15 minutes. The sample was then heated to 480 °C at a heating rate of 6 °C min−1 and then held at 480 °C for 10 minutes. Then, a 50 nm cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer was deposited by chemical bath deposition. A 50 nm intrinsic ZnO layer and a 300 nm Al-doped ZnO (AZO) layer were fabricated by RF sputtering. A 2 μm aluminum grid was deposited by thermal evaporation as the top electrode. Details of these procedures were described in our previous study.15
Analysis and characterization
SEM (Hitachi Co., model S-4800) was used to study impurity diffusion on the annealed SS foil/barrier/Mo surface. To identify the crystal structure, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed in a PANalytical Empyrean instrument with Cu Kα radiation. Ion depth profiles of the samples were determined with ToF-SIMS, with the depth profiling area of 300 × 300 μm2, and a 30 keV Bi cluster primary ion gun was used for the analysis, along with O2+ ion guns for sputtering. The TOF-SIMS results also used the barrier layer thickness information to convert the x-axis sputtering time to a depth scale. The J–V and external quantum efficiency (EQE) performance of the cell on SS foil with the highest efficiency of 10.30% was certified by the Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER) (ESI Fig. S1†). An LCR meter (E4980A, Agilent) was used to estimate the space charge width and carrier density according to capacitance–voltage (C–V) and drive-level capacitance profiling (DLCP) measurements. Admittance spectroscopy (AS) was carried out to obtain the defect levels, and I–V–T was used to calculate the activation energies. The statistics of the optoelectronic properties were determined according to the 1.5 AM illuminated J–V characteristics (94022A solar simulator Newport Co., Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system) in our laboratory.
Results and discussion
To compare the diffusion barrier properties of the SiO2 and ZnO barriers, samples comprising SS foil/SiO2 or ZnO barriers and samples without a barrier/Mo structure were annealed at 800 °C for 1 hour. After annealing a sample at a temperature higher than that required for the chalcogenization process, the Mo surface was observed by SEM (Fig. 1). In the sample without a barrier (Fig. 1a) comprised of a Mo back electrode layer on only an SS foil substrate, the impurities diffused away from the SS foil to form a crystalline structure. In the sample using ZnO as a diffusion barrier (Fig. 1b), the impurities also diffused enough to form a crystalline structure, but the impurities were sparse and small compared with those in the sample without a barrier (ESI Fig. S2†). On the other hand, in the sample that contained the SiO2 diffusion barrier (Fig. 1c), impurities from the SS foil were not found. The TOF-SIMS analysis performed to support these results showed that impurities did not pass through the SiO2 diffusion barrier layer in the sample of SiO2 (ESI Fig. S3†). In summary, the impurities diffused away from the SS in the sample without a barrier (Mo single layer), and the sample that used a ZnO barrier (ZnO/Mo on SS foil) also contained impurities after experiencing harsh conditions at a high temperature. Conversely, SiO2 prevented impurity diffusion. To discuss the impurity diffusion in more detail, we evaluated the diffusion barrier material through the diffusion coefficient, Dmaterial, which is commonly used when dealing with diffusion properties.38,44,45 The diffusion coefficient of a material, Dmaterial, is defined by the following equation:Dmaterial = D0exp(−EA/kT) (cm2 s−1)where D0 is the pre-exponential factor, EA is the activation energy (J mol−1), k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. According to this formula, the diffusion coefficient is determined by the fundamental properties of the material (D0, EA) and increases exponentially with the temperature, T. The difference in the barrier properties between SiO2 and ZnO can be seen in published reports. SiO2 is known to maintain a stable barrier performance with a low diffusion coefficient, even at high temperatures and after long annealing times.38,41 On the other hand, although Fe diffusion though ZnO at high temperatures has been reported,46 the diffusion coefficient of Fe through ZnO was not specifically reported but can be confirmed indirectly. The diffusion coefficient of Fe through ZnO should be similar to the self-diffusion coefficient of Zn.47 Therefore, we can roughly estimate the diffusion coefficient of Fe using the self-diffusion coefficient of Zn through ZnO, where DZnZnO = 1.3 × 10−5exp(−43.5 ± 11.0 (kcal)/RT) cm2 s−1 and R is the gas constant.44 The diffusion coefficient of Fe through SiO2 is .38 At 800 °C, DZnZnO and  are 2.02 × 10−14 cm2 s−1 and 4.89 × 10−17 cm2 s−1, respectively. Thus, we expected that the diffusion coefficient of Fe through ZnO would exceed that in SiO2. In addition, ZnO and SiO2 were in a crystalline and an amorphous phase, respectively, as revealed by XRD (see the blue line and red line in Fig. 2a for ZnO and SiO2 on SS foil, respectively). Since the diffusion coefficient at the grain boundaries is known to be higher than that in the bulk material,39,40 the diffusion coefficient may increase depending on the grain boundary distribution. Therefore, it can be seen that SiO2 is a superior diffusion barrier compared to ZnO for Fe from the SS foil.

(a) Mo/SS foil structure, (b) Mo/ZnO/SS foil structure, and (c) Mo/SiO2/SS foil structure after annealing at 800 °C for 1 h. The impurity crystals were (a) large in the sample without a barrier and (b) relatively small in the sample using the ZnO barrier. (c) On the other hand, no impurity crystals were observed in the sample using the SiO2 barrier. This tendency was the same at a large scale (see ESI Fig. S2†). In the TOF-SIMS of the sample of the SiO2 diffusion barrier, Fe and Cr were not detected in the SiO2 barrier region, and thus, the SiO2 diffusion barrier was sufficiently used as a diffusion barrier (see ESI Fig. S3†).

The diffusion of Fe was prevented in the sample using the SiO2 barrier (red line in (b)), but the diffusion of Fe was observed in the sample using the ZnO barrier (blue line in (b)). 
To compare the performances of the two oxide barrier materials more precisely, we investigated the diffusion barrier/SS foil structure in which the barrier material was exposed to a Se atmosphere similar to that used for the heat treatment conditions of the absorber layer. The anneal was performed at 550 °C with a Se atmosphere for 30 minutes. XRD and TOF-SIMS were used as analytical tools to confirm the differences between the barrier materials (Fig. 2). In the XRD results (Fig. 2a), the sample using the SiO2 barrier did not show any crystalline phases before or after annealing. The SiO2 was grown on the SS foil as an amorphous phase before heat treatment, and no phase transition or crystallized material was found after heat treatment. On the other hand, the ZnO diffusion barrier on SS foil was crystallized. After annealing, Zn(S,Se) and ZnFe2O4 crystalline phases were observed, and the ZnO peak disappeared. It is possible that ZnFe2O4 formed at the interface between the ZnO and SS foil and Zn and that Fe diffused in both directions, which is known as a Wagner counter-diffusion reaction.48
When the depth profile was viewed on a log scale (Fig. 2b), the sample using the ZnO barrier showed a distinct difference compared to that of the SiO2. Fe was not detected in the bulk of the SiO2 diffusion barrier, but a relatively large amount of Fe was detected in the bulk of the ZnO diffusion barrier. In particular, Fe accumulated at a point near the interface (<60 nm). The Fe diffusion in ZnO seemed to be accelerated by another reactant, ZnSe, that appeared in the XRD spectrum after selenization (Fig. 2a). The diffusion coefficient of Fe through ZnSe is ∼10−10 cm2 s−1 at 1000 °C,45 and it is large compared to the diffusion coefficients of Fe through ZnO and SiO2, which are ∼10−13 cm2 s−1 and ∼10−15 cm2 s−1, respectively, at the same temperature. As a result, not only was the basic barrier performance of ZnO poorer than that of SiO2 but the reactants produced by selenization, ZnSe and ZnFe2O4, also deteriorated the performance of the ZnO barrier.
Furthermore, it is possible that synthesizing an increased amount of reactant at an elevated temperature and an extended annealing time accelerates the deterioration of the barrier properties. On the other hand, the SiO2 barrier had excellent barrier properties and did not suffer from degradation due to reactant formation, even at high temperatures and long annealing41,49 times. These results suggest that the selection of the barrier material should be based on the intrinsic diffusion properties of the material as well as the reaction with Se and S during the annealing process.
To confirm the diffusion barrier properties of the actual absorber selenization process, TOF-SIMS and XRD were used for analysis of the CZTSe absorber using SiO2 and ZnO barriers and without a barrier on SS foil (Fig. 3 and ESI Fig. S4†). To fabricate the absorber layer, samples with a Mo back contact and a Zn/Cu/Sn layer on the SiO2 or ZnO barrier and samples without a barrier on the SS foil were annealed in a Se atmosphere. In the XRD pattern, no significant texture changes could be distinguished between the samples of SiO2 and ZnO, but new peaks appeared in the sample without a barrier (ESI Fig. S4a†). The peak is estimated to be the (111) peak of SnSe, but it is not clear whether its presence is due to impurity diffusion. As the CZTSSe (112) peak region was magnified, peaks at almost the same position were observed (ESI Fig. S4b†). It was reported that Fe diffusion in the absorber layer did not produce any change in the CZTSe peak of the XRD pattern.20 Therefore, the identical XRD patterns recorded for the samples of ZnO and SiO2 do not indicate the same in amounts of Fe diffusion. To accurately observe the differences between each of the samples, TOF-SIMS analysis was performed to detect the impurities that diffused into the absorber. In the case of the SS foil/Mo/absorber structure (Fig. 3a) without a diffusion barrier, Fe was detected in the CZTSSe absorber range. However, the chromium occupying 16–18 at% of the SS foil did not diffuse to the absorber region, even without the barrier (blue line in Fig. 3a and black line in Fig. 3e). According to other research on diffusion barriers, Cr was successfully used to prevent the diffusion of impurities depending on the experimental conditions.35 Conversely, Cr diffusion from a Cr steel substrate or an inserted Cr layer resulted in reductions in all performance parameters, such as the PCE (EFF), open circuit voltage (VOC), current density (JSC), and fill factor (FF).50,51 These discrepancies are due to a combination of factors, such as the thickness and growth conditions of the Mo layer and the heat treatment temperature and time. In our experiment, the MoSe2/Mo region seemed to prevent Cr diffusion even without the diffusion barrier. In the sample using the ZnO barrier (Fig. 3b), Se was detected over a wide range of ZnO. During the heat treatment for selenization of the absorber, Se diffused through the absorber and the Mo electrode layer into the ZnO barrier layer (see Fig. 3b red arrow). As previously shown in a heat treatment experiment using ZnO/SS foil structures in which ZnO was directly exposed to a Se atmosphere, ZnO easily reacted with Se to form ZnSe. Thus, at the point where the intensity of Se increases, a kink is observed in the profile of Fe (see Fig. 3b and d green arrow), which is caused by the diffusion coefficient changing due to the formation of ZnSe. Eventually, the ZnO barrier did not sufficiently prevent Fe diffusion as in the harsh condition test, and then Fe was detected in the absorber region. Impurities were not detected in the absorber layer for the SiO2 barrier (Fig. 3c), which retained excellent barrier properties during the harsh annealing conditions. On the other hand, in the Fe depth profile, it can be seen that Fe accumulated in the MoSe2 and Mo interface regions in the samples with the ZnO barrier and without a barrier. We expect that an increase in the impurity intensity at the MoSe2 and Mo regions appeared due to differences in the diffusion coefficient52 and accumulation at the interface.53

In summary, it was found that the ZnO barrier (Fig. 4a) had a crystalline phase with grain boundaries, which presented a high diffusion coefficient and did not provide a stable diffusion barrier to the reactants ZnSe and ZnFe2O4. Thus, SiO2 was better than ZnO as a diffusion barrier due to comprising an amorphous phase and possessing excellent intrinsic diffusion barrier properties and stability at a high temperature in a Se atmosphere (Fig. 4b). Depending on the annealing time, temperature, atmosphere (Se or S), and barrier thickness, for example, the impurity diffusion can change. However, because ZnO has weaknesses as a diffusion barrier, such as its grain boundaries, relatively high diffusion coefficient, and reactivity with Fe and Se, it is advisable to avoid ZnO. Otherwise, these weaknesses can lead to fatal efficiency degradation of the device. These results suggest that the selection a diffusion barrier and reactivity, as well as the corresponding intrinsic barrier properties, is very important.

The diffusion of the impurity was enhanced by the grain boundaries and ZnSe reactant. (b) However, at the amorphous SiO2 barrier, which has a lower diffusion coefficient and no grain boundaries, the Fe impurities were suppressed by the diffusion barrier. 
The SS foil with SiO2 as the diffusion barrier was selected from the above results, and the CZTSSe flexible solar cell was optimized and obtained an EFF of 10.30%, FF of 64.70%, VOC of 531.2 mV, and JSC of 29.96 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5a and ESI Fig. S1†). Fig. 5b shows the EQE. This is the highest efficiency on an SS foil substrate and flexible-substrate CZTSSe solar cell reported to date. The highest efficiency reported to date from a CZTSSe solar cell via vacuum-based processing from the Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST) is very close in terms of the VOC and FF (EFF of 12.62%, FF of 65.9%, VOC of 541 mV, and JSC of 35.39 mA cm−2).18 The Cu/(Zn + Sn) and Zn/Sn ratios of the precursors were 0.653 and 1.425, respectively, as obtained by XRF (X-ray fluorescence). This result was similar to that obtained for the CZTSSe absorber on Mo foil, which is a Fe-free metal substrate, in our previous report. The Cu/(Zn + Sn) and Zn/Sn ratios of the CZTSSe absorber on Mo foil were 0.656 and 1.434, respectively.15 The S/(Se + S) ratio, 0.169, was obtained by XRF. This result is similar to a previously reported result concerning the relationship between the S/(Se + S) ratio and band gap of CZTSSe (1.108 eV, Fig. 5b).54 The VOC deficit was 0.557 eV, which was obtained from the band gap (Eg) (Fig. 5b insert) and VOC (VOC deficit = Eg/q − VOC, where q is the electron charge), and this value is lower than the VOC deficits of 0.617 eV and 0.589 eV obtained from the best IBM and DGIST CZTSSe cells reported to date, respectively.17 In terms of the stability of the diffusion barrier, the average efficiency was high in eight devices (ESI Fig. S5†). However, there was a current loss in the EQE data (Fig. 5b) compared with that of the rigid substrate,17 which resulted in a gap in the efficiency. The loss of the quantum efficiency in the entire wavelength band seemed to have affected the current loss.

Fig. 6a shows the capacitance–voltage (C–V) and DLCP results of the best CZTSSe solar cell on SS foil using SiO2 as the diffusion barrier, which is shown in Fig. 5. Conventional C–V profiling overestimates the carrier density value by projecting a trap density at the interface of the CZTSSe-CdS buffer layer.55 On the other hand, DLCP is not sensitive to the interface trap density because it uses low-order terms from nonlinear differential equations.56 Therefore, the difference between the carrier density obtained from the DLCP (NDL) and C–V (NCV) at zero bias indicates a trap density at the interface (NIT) of the CZTSSe absorption layer-CdS buffer layer.57 The drive-level density (NDL) was approximately 1.76 × 1016 cm−3, and the depletion width (at zero bias) was 0.117 μm. The C–V curve had a higher value than the DLCP result, and the NCV was 2.53 × 1016 cm−3. Therefore, the trap density (NIT) in the interface of the CZTSSe-CdS buffer layer was 7.62 × 1015 cm−3. This is similar to the NIT characteristic of CZTSSe, with the highest efficiency of 12.6% reported by IBM.17 On the other hand, the carrier density (NDL) obtained from DLCP was measured to be relatively high. Such a high carrier density may result in a decrease in the depletion length of 0.117 μm and an increased probability of recombination, which leads to a decreased JSC. A detailed study of this is discussed next. To further confirm the characteristics of the interface of the CZTSSe absorption layer-CdS buffer layer, see Fig. 6b, in which the temperature dependence of the VOC was confirmed. To confirm the activation energy (EA) at the interface of the CZTSSe absorber-CdS buffer layer, the following correlation between the VOC and T was examined:VOC = EA/q − AkT/q × ln(J00/JL),where A is the diode ideality factor, kT/q is the thermal voltage, J00 is the reverse saturation current prefactor, and JL is the photocurrent.58,59 When data in the range of the VOC measurement temperatures (90 K < T < 300 K) were linearly extrapolated, it was observed that the EA was the value at T = 0 K. When the main recombination mechanism in the depletion region of the CZTSSe absorber follows the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) process, the activation energy (EA) equals the band gap (Eg).58–60 However, if there are other recombination processes, such as interface recombination at the CZTSSe absorber-CdS buffer layer interface, the difference Eg − EA increases. The difference Eg − EA was 0.038 eV in the best CZTSSe solar cell on SS foil. In the case of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) on SLG with an efficiency of over 10%, the difference Eg − EA was 0.25 eV.61 Therefore, this result indicates that the density of recombination centers at the interface of the CZTSSe absorber-CdS buffer layer was relatively low, which is consistent with the low NIT value at V = 0 V (see Fig. 6a).

Fig. 6c shows the AS measurement results of the best CZTSSe solar cell on an SS foil substrate. To verify the defect activation energy, we constructed an Arrhenius plot of the inflection points from the AS curves, as shown in Fig. 6d. The Arrhenius plot was calculated using:62ω0 = 2πν0T2exp(−Ea/kT)where ω0 is the inflection point of the capacitance function, Ea is the energy level of defects from the valence band maximum (VBM), and ν0 is the pre-exponential factor.57 These defects appear in the form of vacancies (VA), interstitials (Ai), AB antisites (A replacing B), and defect clusters. As shown in Fig. 6d, the shallower main defect energy level was 51 meV (Ea1), corresponding to the main defect energy level being 80 meV (Ea2), produced by VZn−, CuZn−, and ZnSn− defects.63 Therefore, the defect effect caused by the impurities from the SS foil was not observed due to the prevention of impurities by the SiO2 diffusion barrier. These acceptor defects and donor defects may compensate and attract each other, forming defect clusters. The defect clusters that can be predicted from Fig. 6d include VCu + ZnCu, CuZn + ZnCu, ZnSn + 2ZnCu, 2VCu + SnZn, VZn + SnZn, ZnSn + SnZn, and 2CuZn + SnZn. Among these defect clusters, the formation energies of VCu + ZnCu, CuZn + ZnCu, ZnSn + 2ZnCu, and 2CuZn + SnZn are relatively low, and these clusters are likely to be generated as high-population clusters.63 In particular, 2CuZn + SnZn can act as an electron trapping cluster because of the bandgap narrowing effect in the absorption layer. In light of these results, intrinsic defects in the CZTSSe absorber layer are not detrimental because they exhibit relatively shallow defect energy levels, but they can cause VOC loss through 2CuZn + SnZn defect clusters originating from these intrinsic defects.
Conclusion
We showed that the diffusion barrier material for CZTSSe solar cells on SS foil substrates may have an adverse effect on the diffusion barrier properties due to reactivity with Se, S and the impurities from the SS foil. In particular, ZnO is not only a poor diffusion barrier due to the presence of grain boundaries and its high diffusion coefficient compared with that of SiO2 but is also a poor diffusion barrier because ZnO is deteriorated by the formation of ZnSe. As a result, ZnO failed as a diffusion barrier; thus, Fe diffused into the absorber layer from the SS foil. In contrast, SiO2 was suitable as a diffusion barrier in the CZTSSe solar cell because it is amorphous, does not have grain boundaries and has a low diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, SiO2 maintained excellent diffusion barrier properties even at the high temperature of 800 °C while in a Se or S atmosphere. Thus, SiO2 was used in the CZTSSe solar cell on SS foil, resulting in a PCE of 10.30%, which is the highest efficiency recorded thus far for flexible CZTSSe solar cells on an SS substrate. This solar cell demonstrated the best performance of the cells considered herein, namely, VOC = 531.2 mV, JSC = 29.96 mA cm−2, FF = 64.70%, and EFF = 10.30%. Fe impurities were not found in the SIMS, NIT from C–V, DLCP or AS defect analysis results. This means that SiO2 is an effective diffusion barrier and enables CZTSSe as well as CIGS thin-film solar cells to be considered for advanced flexible solar cells using SS foil as the substrate.

 	Fig. 1  SEM images of the surface of the Mo back contact layer for various diffusion barriers. (a) Mo/SS foil structure, (b) Mo/ZnO/SS foil structure, and (c) Mo/SiO2/SS foil structure after annealing at 800 °C for 1 h. The impurity crystals were (a) large in the sample without a barrier and (b) relatively small in the sample using the ZnO barrier. (c) On the other hand, no impurity crystals were observed in the sample using the SiO2 barrier. This tendency was the same at a large scale (see ESI Fig. S2†). In the TOF-SIMS of the sample of the SiO2 diffusion barrier, Fe and Cr were not detected in the SiO2 barrier region, and thus, the SiO2 diffusion barrier was sufficiently used as a diffusion barrier (see ESI Fig. S3†).	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) XRD patterns of SS foil (grey), as-prepared (blue) and selenized (dark blue) ZnO/SS foil structures, and as-prepared (red) and selenized (dark red) SiO2/SS foil. In the as-prepared ZnO/SS foil (blue), the reflections indexed to ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451). ZnSe (JCPDS 70-0777) and ZnFe2O4 (JCPDS 00-022-1012) were present in the selenized ZnO/SS foil (dark blue). TOF-SIMS depth profile of Fe in SiO2 (red) and ZnO (blue)/SS foil after selenization on (b) a log scale of intensity. The diffusion of Fe was prevented in the sample using the SiO2 barrier (red line in (b)), but the diffusion of Fe was observed in the sample using the ZnO barrier (blue line in (b)).

 	Fig. 4  Scheme of the CZTSe absorber on the SS foil using (a) ZnO and (b) SiO2 diffusion barriers. (a) The impurity (Fe) diffused through the ZnO barrier and the Mo layer into the absorber. The diffusion of the impurity was enhanced by the grain boundaries and ZnSe reactant. (b) However, at the amorphous SiO2 barrier, which has a lower diffusion coefficient and no grain boundaries, the Fe impurities were suppressed by the diffusion barrier.
