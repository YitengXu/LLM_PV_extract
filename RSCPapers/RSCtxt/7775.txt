    , Accepted 19th February 2016First published on 19th February 2016AbstractA low-cost spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX) based organic hole transport material (HTM) termed X60 was designed and synthesized using a two-step synthetic route. Devices with X60 as HTM showed high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) amounting to 7.30% in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (ssDSCs) and 19.84% in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G solar illumination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of an easily synthesized spiro-structured HTM that shows comparable performance with respect to the well-known HTM Spiro-OMeTAD in both ssDSCs and PSCs. Furthermore, the facile synthesis of X60 from commercially available starting materials makes this HTM very promising for large-scale industrial production in the future.

Broader context
A great deal of research progress on solid state dye sensitized solar cells (ssDSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been made during the past few years. Spiro-OMeTAD is considered to be the most successful HTM and has achieved the best device performance in both ssDSCs and PSCs. However, it has been widely demonstrated that the lengthy synthetic route and high synthetic cost of the 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-9,9′-spirobi[fluorene] (4Br-SBF) core of Spiro-OMeTAD will significantly limit its large-scale application in the future. Therefore, the development of a new generation of HTMs that are low-cost and exhibit high performance in ssDSCs and PSCs is highly important. Recently, a low-cost spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX) based HTM termed X60 has been synthesized via a two-step synthetic route and investigated in ssDSCs and PSCs by our group. Devices with X60 as HTM showed high PCEs of 7.30% in ssDSCs and 19.84% in PSCs under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G solar illumination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case where an easily synthesized spiro-structured HTM has shown comparable performance with Spiro-OMeTAD in both ssDSCs and PSCs. Furthermore, the facile synthesis of X60 from cheap commercially available starting material makes this HTM very promising for the large-scale industrial production of ssDSCs and PSCs in the future.

Solution processable photovoltaic devices, such as solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells1 (ssDSCs) and perovskite solar cells2,3 (PSCs) have shown great potential to replace conventional semiconductor-based solar cells. Their ease of manufacture and high efficiencies indicate their usefulness for low-cost and large-area solar electrical energy generation in the near future. To date, the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) for ssDSCs is 7.7% and this was achieved using Spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene) (Fig. S7, ESI†) as a hole transport material (HTM) combined the organic dye LEG4 (Fig. S7, ESI†), which has a high molar extinction coefficient, as a photosensitizer.4,5 The record PCEs for PSCs of >20% have also been obtained using Spiro-OMeTAD as a HTM combined with state-of-the-art perovskite materials as light absorbers.6–8 The organic HTM plays an important role in regenerating the oxidized state of the light absorber in ssDSCs and in scavenging photogenerated holes in PSCs, and it also aides the transport of holes to the counter-electrode in both ssDSCs and PSCs, thus making it a vital component for efficient photoelectric conversion.9–12 Although a large number of novel HTMs have been developed recently based on both small molecules13–19 and polymer20–23 materials, Spiro-OMeTAD is still considered to be the most successful HTM. However, it has been widely demonstrated that the complex synthetic route and purification of the 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-9,9′-spirobi[fluorene] (4Br-SBF) core of Spiro-OMeTA, renders it with a high synthetic cost and significantly limits potential large-scale application in the future. The total synthesis involves four steps including a Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction, a Grignard reaction, a cyclization reaction and a bromination reaction from commercially available raw materials with a total yield of less than 30%.24–26 In addition, the Grignard reaction used in the synthesis normally requires harsh reaction conditions. Although several spiro-structured HTMs27–29 have been developed for PSCs, the simplification of their syntheses and their photovoltaic performance are still not competitive.
Herein, we have designed and synthesized a low-cost spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX) based HTM termed X60 (Fig. 1) based on a route with only two synthetic steps, which can be applied to both ssDSCs and PSCs. Devices using X60 as HTM exhibited high PCEs of up to 7.30% for ssDSCs and up to 19.84% for PSCs under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G solar illumination. These values are comparable to the reported record PCEs of 7.7%5 (ssDSCs) and 20.8%8 (PSCs) obtained using the well-known Spiro-OMeTAD as HTM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of an easily synthesized spiro-type HTM that shows comparable performance to Spiro-OMeTAD in both ssDSCs and PSCs. Furthermore, the facile synthesis of X60 based on commercially available starting materials makes this HTM very promising for large-scale industrial production in the future.

The synthetic route (Scheme 1) towards X60 only requires two steps and uses commercially available raw material, which is much simpler than that of the synthesis of Spiro-OMeTAD (five steps).26 Firstly, the 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromospiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (4Br-SFX) core was constructed using a one-pot approach30 with 4-bromophenol and 2,7-dibromo-9-fluorenone as the starting materials resulting in a high yield (91%). It is also notable that no column purification was required in advance of the next synthetic step. Subsequently, a palladium-catalyzed, Buchwald–Hartwig cross-coupling reaction was utilized to obtain the target compound X60. The overall yield of this synthetic route is >70% (two steps), and no air sensitive, corrosive or toxic reagents need to be used during the synthesis. Most importantly, the estimated synthesis cost of 4Br-SFX is thirty times lower than that of 4Br-SBF, which is promising for mass production. The detailed synthetic procedure and a cost estimation can be found in the ESI.†

The redox potentials (Eox) of X60 were determined by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S3, ESI†) and differential pulsed voltammetry (DPV) (Fig. S4, ESI†) in dichloromethane (DCM) solution, and the corresponding data are collected in Table 1. The Eox value of X60 was determined to be 0.65 V vs. NHE, which is slightly higher than that of Spiro-OMeTAD (0.63 V) under the same conditions. Thus, a slightly higher photovoltage was expected in X60-based devices. Absorption and fluorescence spectra (Fig. S5, ESI†) in toluene were recorded at a concentration of 10−5 M. All photophysical data for the HTMs are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). X60 exhibits similar absorption and emission bands as Spiro-OMeTAD positioned at about 389 nm and 419 nm, respectively. These similar optical properties might be attributable to the similar chemical structures of the two compounds. The transition energy E0–0 and optical band gap of X60 could be obtained from the intersection of the emission and absorption spectra (Table S1, ESI†).

The calculation of the reorganization energy (ER) of each molecule was carried out using Gaussian 09, and the corresponding values are listed in Table 1. The results obtained from these density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that X60 is expected to show a smaller ER value (426 meV) than Spiro-OMeTAD (495 meV), and this may indicate that X60 can exhibit faster hole-transport in a HTM film. Subsequently, the hole mobility of X60 was determined by using space-charge-limited currents (SCLCs)31,32 with Spiro-OMeTAD used as a reference. Fitting the J–V curves (Fig. 2a) of the materials to a space-charge model gave the mobility data listed in Table 1. The hole mobility of X60 is slightly higher than that of Spiro-OMeTAD, which is in good agreement with the results from the computational data with respect to the difference in reorganization energy. The conductivities of the X60 and Spiro-OMeTAD-based films were determined by using a two-contact electrical conductivity set-up following a previously reported procedure,31 and the obtained results are shown in Fig. 2b and Table 1. It should be noted that the measured conductivity of the X60 film is 1.1 × 10−4 S cm−1, which is comparable to that of the Spiro-OMeTAD based film (1.5 × 10−4 S cm−1) under the same conditions. Clearly, the optical, electrochemical and electronic properties of X60 are quite similar to those of Spiro-OMeTAD due to their similar chemical structures.

Due to its spiro structure, X60 possesses high solubility in chlorobenzene (>2000 mg mL−1), which is beneficial for solution processing. In this work, we fabricated ssDSC devices using X60 as HTM in combination with the high-absorbing organic dye LEG433 as a photosensitizer. The concentrations of additives, such as bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP), used in the devices were the same as those for Spiro-OMeTAD (detailed information can be found in the ESI†).5 The J–V curves of the best devices under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G solar illumination with reverse and forward scans are shown in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding parameters are stated in Table 2. The X60-based ssDSCs device exhibited a highest efficiency of 7.30%, with a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 11.38 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) of 0.89 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.72 under reverse scan conditions, while a PCE of 7.16% was obtained under forward scan conditions with a JSC of 11.12 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.92 V and an FF of 0.70, thereby yielding an average PCE of 7.23%. The efficiency achieved using X60 as HTM in a ssDSC was close to the reported record PCE for Spiro-OMeTAD based devices. It is interesting to note that we also observed a small amount of hysteretic behavior in the X60-based ssDSCs.34 However, further studies found that the PCEs of the ssDSCs were not affected by the scan rates used. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the best device is shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The calculated photocurrent from the IPCE spectrum agrees well with the measured JSC, which is shown in Table 2.

The above results clearly show that X60 can be used as an excellent HTM in ssDSCs. This encouraged us to also fabricate solar cells employing a state-of-the-art perovskite material as the light absorber. The configuration of this type of solid-state PSC was as follows: compact TiO2/nc-TiO2/perovskite/HTM/Au, where the perovskite layer was prepared by mixing formamidinium iodide (FAI), lead iodide (PbI2), methylammonium bromide (MABr) and lead bromide (PbBr2) in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (volume ratio 4:1).8 The molar ratios of each component were as follows: PbI2/PbBr2 = 85/15, PbI2/FAI = 1.05 and PbBr2/MABr = 1/1.8 In addition, due to the low conductivity of small molecule-based HTMs, X60 also needed to be doped into the devices. The doping concentrations of X60 that were used in the devices were the same as Spiro-OMeTAD (detailed information can be found in ESI†).8J–V curves obtained from the best performing solar cells under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G solar illumination obtained from reverse and forward scans are shown in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The best X60 based PSC device exhibited a PCE of 19.84%, with a VOC of 1.14 V, a JSC of 24.2 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.71 under reverse scan conditions, and a 19.26% efficiency was obtained under forward scan conditions with a VOC of 1.14 V, a JSC of 24.1 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.69, thereby yielding an average efficiency of 19.55%. The obtained PCE for the PSC based on X60 rivals the reported record efficiency of Spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs.8 In addition, almost no hysteretic behavior35–37 could be observed in the X60-based PSCs, and the photovoltaic parameters of the devices were not affected by the scan rates used. The IPCE spectrum of the best solar cell is displayed in Fig. S10 (ESI†), and the calculated photocurrent was very close to the measured JSC (see Table 2). In brief, our results clearly demonstrate that this low-cost HTM, X60, shows excellent performance in both ssDSC and PSC photovoltaic devices.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a low-cost methoxydiphenylamine-substituted organic HTM denoted X60 based on a spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX) core for high performance ssDSCs and PSCs. The X60-based devices exhibited high efficiencies in both ssDSCs (7.30%) and PSCs (19.84%) under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G solar illumination. These results are competitive with the reported record PCEs of ssDSC and PSC devices based on the well-known HTM Spiro-OMeTAD. Moreover, the synthetic route towards X60 is simple, requiring only two steps from commercially available starting materials, no intermediate purification and an overall yield of >70%, making this HTM very promising for large-scale industrial production. The presented results clearly qualify this new spiro-type organic HTM as a base material for the future development of materials for commercial application in high-efficiency ssDSCs and PSCs.

Broader context
A great deal of research progress on solid state dye sensitized solar cells (ssDSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been made during the past few years. Spiro-OMeTAD is considered to be the most successful HTM and has achieved the best device performance in both ssDSCs and PSCs. However, it has been widely demonstrated that the lengthy synthetic route and high synthetic cost of the 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-9,9′-spirobi[fluorene] (4Br-SBF) core of Spiro-OMeTAD will significantly limit its large-scale application in the future. Therefore, the development of a new generation of HTMs that are low-cost and exhibit high performance in ssDSCs and PSCs is highly important. Recently, a low-cost spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX) based HTM termed X60 has been synthesized via a two-step synthetic route and investigated in ssDSCs and PSCs by our group. Devices with X60 as HTM showed high PCEs of 7.30% in ssDSCs and 19.84% in PSCs under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G solar illumination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case where an easily synthesized spiro-structured HTM has shown comparable performance with Spiro-OMeTAD in both ssDSCs and PSCs. Furthermore, the facile synthesis of X60 from cheap commercially available starting material makes this HTM very promising for the large-scale industrial production of ssDSCs and PSCs in the future.
