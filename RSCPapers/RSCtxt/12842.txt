    , Accepted 21st February 2018First published on 22nd February 2018AbstractBy dicyanomethylenation on the central squaric acceptor core, three unsymmetrical squaraines (USQ), namely diCN-USQ-1–3, were synthesized, and in-depth comparative studies between them and their reference compounds (USQ-1–3) were carried out. The results indicate that the presence of dicyanomethylene groups on the central squaric ring will lead to distinctly altered properties on the entire π-conjugated system of the fluorophore, such as lowering of the optical bandgap, deepening of the HOMO energy level, increasing of the dipole moment and changing on the dipole moment direction. Consequently, solution-processed bulk-heterojunction small molecule organic solar cells (BHJ-SMOSCs) using these diCN-USQs as electron donor materials could simultaneously show much enhanced open-circuit voltage and significantly increased short-circuit current density, and hence drastically higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) than their corresponding USQ-based reference devices (PCE: 1.46%, 1.91%, and 4.58% for diCN-USQ-1–3, and 0.45%, 0.77%, and 3.05% for USQ-1–3 in sequence). Note that the diCN-USQ-3-based device shows a PCE of 4.58%, which is the highest value among all the reported organic solar cells based on centrally substituted squaraines.
1. Introduction
Owing to their unique properties like intense absorption and emission in the visible near-infrared (Vis–NIR) spectral regions and excellent photostability, squaraine (SQ) dyes have received considerable attention in organic solar cells (OSCs),1–3 photodynamic therapy,4,5 nonlinear optics,6,7 fluorescent probes,8–10etc. As a consequence, the structural modification of SQ dyes has become an active research area.
Generally, squaraines are prepared through 1,3-dicondensation reactions of squaric acid with electron-rich arenes (e.g., anilines, pyrroles)11,12 or heterocyclic methylenic bases (e.g., indolenines)13 to render a donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) molecular skeleton, and hence most of the structural modifications of SQs were focused on the alteration of D units to construct either symmetrical11 or unsymmetrical14 squaraine (USQ) derivatives. However, some research efforts have been devoted to the modification on the central squaric A subunit by replacing one of the two oxygen atoms of the acceptor segment with an electron-deficient group, such as dicyanomethylene (diCN),15–17 1,3-indanone,18,19 barbituric acid,20,21etc. Excitingly, the resultant central modified squaraines were found to show more red-shifted absorption, lower optical bandgaps and closer intermolecular packing as well,18 and hence could act as quite fascinating materials for various applications. In fact, it has been demonstrated that in comparison with normal SQ derivatives, central diCN-modified SQs are more promising in organic thin-film transistor applications.22
Nonetheless, in the organic photovoltaic (OPV) field, to date, there have been only few reports on central diCN-substituted SQs.20,23–25 As far as their molecular framework is concerned, these diCN-modified OPV squaraines could be classified as either type-A (D subunits are linked to the A subunit via methylidene bridges) or type-B (D subunits are connected to the A subunits via a pyrrole and a methylidene bridge, respectively.) (Fig. 1). Although it was exhilarating that the central diCN-modified SQs were all found to show better OPV performance than their non-substituted counterparts, the PCE data of BHJ photovoltaic devices based on them were still rather unsatisfactory (≤2%), which should be ascribed to the quite poor photovoltaic performance of the reference SQs (PCE < 0.5%). Hence we conjectured that if the dicyanomethylenation was carried out on the squaric core of SQs, they were capable of showing higher OPV performance; for example, in the central unsubstituted type-C SQs,26–29 relatively high photovoltaic performance might be obtained successfully. Nevertheless, despite our enormous efforts, little success has been achieved with regard to type-C SQ compounds (videFig. 2). Fortunately, in 2015, Lee et al. reported that a type-C SQ molecule could be prepared through the condensation reaction between 4e and dibutylaniline with a very low yield of 8%.30 Enlightened by their work, herein, we successfully reported the synthesis of a central substituted type-C SQ derivative diCN-USQ-1 bearing a quite similar molecular structure to the compound reported by Lee et al. in a much higher yield (58.6% vs. 8%, videFig. 2) through a modified synthesis route. More importantly, using this synthesis route, two type-C SQs bearing extended π-conjugation systems and hydroxyl (–OH) substituents capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen-bonds, namely diCN-USQ-2 and diCN-USQ-3, were rationally designed and synthesized for OPV applications. In addition, to gain insight into the effects of the central dicyanomethylenation on the photovoltaic performance of SQs, three reference compounds USQ-1–3 were also synthesized, and comparative studies were carried out. The results indicate that the presence of a diCN group on the central squaric ring will result in drastically altered properties of the fluorophores, such as bandgap lowering, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level deepening, dipole moment increasing, and dipole moment direction altering, most of which are beneficial to the OPV performance. Accordingly, solution-processed bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) using diCN-USQ-1–3 as electron donor materials all displayed drastically better photovoltaic performance than their corresponding USQ-based reference devices. It is noteworthy that the diCN-USQ-3-based device showed a PCE of 4.58%. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest PCE value among all the reported organic solar cells based on central substituted squaraines (Fig. 3).

2. Experimental
2.1. Instruments and characterization

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance AVII (400 MHz) instrument with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. High resolution mass spectra were measured on a Waters Q-TOF Premier. Element Analysis carried out on a Flash EA 1112. Absorption spectra of the target compounds in 2 × 10−6 M chloroform solution and thin film states were measured with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 950 UV-Vis scanning spectrophotometer. The morphologies of the blend films were analyzed through atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode under ambient conditions (MFP 3D Asylum Research instrument), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation was performed on a JEM-2100 plus. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were performed on a LK2010 electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. All CV measurements were carried out at room temperature in a conventional three-electrode configuration employing a Pt disk as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and a Ag/AgNO3 electrode as the reference electrode. Dichloromethane was freshly distilled from phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) under dry argon. Tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (0.1 M) was used as the supporting electrolyte. Ferrocenium/ferrocene redox couples (with an absolute energy of −4.80 eV under vacuum) were used as the internal potential reference for USQ-3 and diCN-USQ-1–3, and the external potential reference for USQ-1-2, respectively. The HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of these USQ dyes were calculated from the peak of the first oxidation and reduction waves by comparison with the Fc/Fc+ redox couple according to the equation of HOMO = −(Eox + 4.80) (eV) and the equation of LUMO = −(Ered + 4.80) (eV), respectively. The samples for AFM measurements were prepared by spin-casting the blend solution of USQ/PC71BM (1:3 in wt%) on glass substrates. Samples for TEM measurements were prepared by spin-casting the blend solution of USQ/PC71BM (1:3 in wt%) on PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO substrates, then floating the films on a water surface and transferring them to the TEM grids.
2.2. Synthesis
Compound USQ-3 was synthesized according to our reported procedures.31 The synthesis routes to the intermediates and target molecules are illustrated in Scheme S1 (ESI†) and Scheme 1.23,25,32N,N-dibutylaniline reacted with freshly prepared squaric chloride to give the corresponding semi-squaric chloride 1a. Then 1a was converted into its semi-squaric ethyl ester 3a, followed by treatment with malononitrile in the presence of triethylamine (TEA) to afford the intermediate 4a. Through condensation of 4a with 3-butyl-2-methylbenzo[d]thiazol-3-ium iodide (5), the objective compound diCN-USQ-1 was readily prepared. Similarly, the other two objective compounds diCN-USQ-2 and diCN-USQ-3 were synthesized by condensation of intermediate 4b with 5 or 4c with 6, respectively. For the reference compounds USQ-1-2, they were synthesized via condensation reactions between squaric chloride and aniline derivatives with or without hydroxyl substituents to render the intermediates 1a and b. After hydrolysis, the resultant intermediates 2a and b were condensed with 5, as described in our previous report33 to afford USQ-1-2.

2.3. Device fabrication
The BHJ cells bearing USQ:PC71BM photoactive layers were fabricated as follows: patterned indium-tin-oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were cleaned using detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol in sequence in an ultrasonic bath. The cleaned substrates were dried and kept in an oven at 65 °C and exposed to UV–ozone for 20 min, and then were immediately transferred into a high-vacuum chamber (2 × 10−4 Pa) for the deposition of a 8 nm MoO3 thin layer. Photoactive layers with thicknesses of 65 ± 5 nm were fabricated by spin-coating USQ:PC71BM solution (20 mg mL−1 in chloroform) on the MoO3 pre-coated ITO substrates in a N2-filled glovebox. Then the substrates were transferred back to a high-vacuum chamber where BCP (6 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited on the top of the electrode at pressures of less than 6 × 10−5 Pa with a rate of 0.20 Å s−1 and 2 × 10−4 Pa with a rate of 1.5–4.0 Å s−1, respectively, so that OSCs with a device structure of ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/USQs:PC71BM (65 nm)/BCP (6 nm)/Al (100 nm) were obtained. The active area of each cell is 0.09 cm2 defined by the overlap of the ITO anode and the Al cathode.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and characterization
Generally, central unsubstituted type-C SQs are synthesized in the following three steps: (1) squaric diester is condensed with 1.0 equivalent of a heterocyclic methylenic base to afford the corresponding semi-squaric ester; (2) the semi-squaric ester is subject to hydrolysis to yield the corresponding semi-squaric acid; (3) the semi-squaric acid is condensed with an electron-rich arene derivative to render central unsubstituted type-C SQs. Yet with regard to central diCN-modified type-C SQs, although we have successfully synthesized the intermediate 4d, we failed in the third step of the condensation of 4d with an N-phenylindoline derivative, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Nevertheless, in 2015, Lee30 and co-workers reported that type-C SQs could be successfully prepared via condensation of 4e with dibutylaniline, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Despite the ultra-low yield of 8%, this research finding re-aroused our interesting in constructing novel central diCN-modified type-C SQs for OPV applications.
However, it is really frustrating that through the synthesis procedure reported by Lee et al., we still failed in acquiring diCN-USQ-1 in the last step, despite its quite similar molecular structure with the compound reported by Lee et al. (videFig. 2). Since in terms of the electronic effect, the presence of more electron-deficient diCN than an oxygen atom in 4f should promote the reactivity of the semi-squaric acid, we conjectured that our failure in the last condensation step should originate from the bulky steric hindrance the dicyanomethylene group brought in. Taking into consideration that the heterocyclic methylenic base segment should be more spatially accessible than the arene segment when condensed with semi-squaric acid, herein, we inverted the conventional condensation steps for diCN-USQ-1, i.e., firstly, squaric chloride was condensed with N,N-dibutylaniline followed by alcoholysis and dicyanomethylenation to afford the semi-squaric acid 4a, and then 4a was condensed with the heterocyclic methylenic base 5 (shown in Scheme 1 and S1 in the ESI†).34,35 Excitingly, using this inverted condensation strategy, diCN-USQ-1 can be prepared in a quite satisfactory yield of 58.6%. Encouraged by this observation, diCN-USQ-2 bearing an extra hydroxyl (–OH) substituent capable of forming more intramolecular hydrogen-bonds than diCN-USQ-1 and diCN-USQ-3 bearing a more extended π-conjugation system than diCN-USQ-2 were successfully synthesized for OPV applications with moderate yields of >26%. Moreover, three reference compounds of type-C USQ-1–3 were synthesized to gain insight into the structure–property correlations.
The molecular structures of the objective and reference compounds were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HR-MS. It should be pointed out that for reference compound USQ-2, the protons of the OH groups and the methylidyne unit split into two peaks, (OH for 12.01 and 11.87 ppm) and (CH for 6.01 and 6.10 ppm), which is due to the presence of two conformational isomers for USQ-2 in solution, according to our previous reports.31 Upon dicyanomethylenation, the chemical shifts of the protons of the methylidyne unit are significantly downfield-shifted (from 6.11–6.24 ppm in USQ-1–3 to 6.89–7.02 ppm in diCN-USQ-1–3), indicative of the much stronger electron-withdrawing nature of the diCN group than the oxygen atom. It is noteworthy that all these SQ dyes show solubility in CHCl3 (>10 mg mL−1), and high-quality thin films could be obtained through spin-coating, suggesting that they are solution-processable.
3.2. Single crystal X-ray crystallography
To gain insight into the intermolecular interactions of these compounds, X-ray crystallographic analysis were carried out on the single crystal samples of USQ-2 and diCN-USQ-2. The corresponding intermolecular packing patterns are shown in Fig. 4, and the corresponding crystallographic data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4, the two compounds display similar planarized π-scaffolds, and diCN-USQ-2 just shows a few larger twists (φ = 8.86°) between the squaric core and phenyl moiety than those of USQ-2 (φ = 6.34°) due to the larger steric effect that originated from the diCN group. However, the two molecules show quite different packing patterns. In the case of USQ-2, it is found to pack in a head-to-tail arrangement to form a staircase-type J-dimer with a relatively small angle of slippage of 32.4°, indicative of J-aggregate characteristics. In the case of diCN-USQ-2, however, the molecules aggregate in an antiparallel way to form a sandwich-type arrangement (H-dimer) with a relatively large slippage angle of 71.8°. diCN-USQ-2 exhibits a significantly different packing mode compared with USQ-2, even though they have similar molecular structures. The different packing mode could arise from the diCN group because the diCN group affects dipole–dipole interactions and has been also observed in the crystal structures of similar acceptor-substituted squaraines as well as merocyanines.22,36 In addition, USQ-2, strong interplane π–π stacking could be discerned with a π–π distance equidistant from the upper and lower neighbour of 3.80 Å; while for diCN-USQ-2, both interplane π–π and edge-to-π stacking could be observed, and the shortest π–π distance is 3.59 Å.

3.3. Optical absorption characterization
The optical properties of USQs were investigated via UV-Vis absorption spectra in both dilute chloroform solution (2 × 10−6 M) and thin film states. As depicted in Fig. 5 and Table 1, all the compounds show intense absorption (molar extinction coefficient > 105 M−1 cm−1) in Vis–NIR regions. The λmax of diCN-USQ-1–3 is 672–720 nm, ∼40 nm red-shifted than their counterparts USQ-1–3, indicating that the presence of a diCN moiety in USQ dyes can trigger more extended conjugation systems and/or intensified intramolecular charge transfer within the molecules.37,38 It is noteworthy that the absorption bands of diCN-USQ-1–3 are broader (full width at half maximum, FWHM: 60, 49, and 65 nm, respectively) than those of USQ-1–3 (FWHM: 47, 37, and 48 nm) in solution. In the thin solid film state, all these compounds show significantly broadened absorption spectra, and most of them have their λabs red-shifted than those in solution, indicative of the presence of strong molecular aggregation in the solid film state. From the onset of the absorption spectra in the thin film state, the optical bandgaps were calculated to be 1.67, 1.64, and 1.57 eV for USQ-1–3, and 1.61, 1.53, and 1.49 eV for diCN-USQ-1–3 in sequence. It is noteworthy that in sharp contrast to other compounds, diCN-USQ-2 has its λabs located at 632 nm, which is 52 nm blue-shifted than that measured in dilute solution. Since generally, H-aggregates will display hypochromic-shifted λabs in their absorption spectra,39,40 and according to the X-ray crystallographic analysis results, H-dimers are discernible in the crystal structure of diCN-USQ-2, and the spectral changes of diCN-USQ-2 in solid films can be safely ascribed to the formation of H-aggregates.22

3.4. Electrochemical characterization
The energy levels of the frontier orbitals of these USQs were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in CH2Cl2 solution, as shown in Fig. 6 and Table 1, by comparison with the Fc/Fc+ redox couple whose energy level is −4.80 eV in vacuum.41 From the onset of the first oxidation potential, the HOMO energy levels of the objective compounds were calculated to be −4.97, −5.01, and −5.11 eV for diCN-USQ-1–3 in sequence; while those for the reference compounds USQ-1–3 were −4.88, −4.89, and −5.02 eV in sequence. In all the cases, the objective compounds show ∼0.1 eV deeper HOMO energy levels compared to their corresponding reference compounds, suggesting that a diCN group is more electron-deficient than an oxygen atom. Therefore, higher Voc can be expected in diCN-USQ-based OSCs compared to their corresponding USQ-based reference devices. From the onset of the first reduction potential, the LUMO energy levels of diCN-USQ-1–3 were calculated to be −3.34, −3.52, and −3.60 eV, respectively, which are 0.1–0.2 eV lower than those of their corresponding reference USQ compounds. Note that for all these USQ compounds, their LUMO levels are more than 0.3 eV higher than that of PC71BM. This is beneficial to efficient exciton dissociation and charge separation in the blending system of PC71BM/USQ.42
 Fig. 6  Cyclic voltammograms of the objective compounds (ferrocenium/ferrocene redox couple were used as the internal potential reference for USQ-3 and diCN-USQ-1–3, and external potential reference for USQ-1-2, respectively). 
3.5. Theoretical calculation
To gain insights into the effects of diCN-substitution on the electronic properties and intermolecular interactions of these USQ dyes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using Gaussian at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the HOMO and LUMO of USQ-1–3 show similar delocalized electronic structures, which leads to a relatively narrow absorption band. However, for diCN-USQ-1–3, the electronic structures of their HOMO and LUMO are different, since the diCN group contributes much to the HOMO but little to the LUMO. Consequently, compared with USQ-1–3, diCN-USQ-1–3 should not only exhibit a broader absorption band, but also possess a deeper HOMO level due to the electron-deficient diCN group. The results are well consistent with the optical and electrochemical characterization, which reveal the reliability of the computational calculations.
Interestingly, for the three reference compounds USQ-1–3, the direction of their molecular dipole moments are quite similar: from the centre of the four-member-ring to the methylidyne-bridged heterocyclic ring, as shown in Fig. 7, and the dipole moment values for USQ-1–3 are 1.86, 2.69, and 2.94 D, respectively. Yet for the diCN-modified diCN-USQs, the direction of their dipole moments are found to be from the centre of the squaric core to the oxygen atom of the four-member-ring, and the dipole moment values for diCN-USQ-1–3 are 7.32, 5.30, and 6.48 D in sequence. These results indicate that the central diCN-substitution can not only lead to a significantly changed dipole moment direction, but also result in drastically increased dipole moment values, which will change the molecular interaction, and then might affect the molecular packing and surface energy of materials. For example, diCN-USQ-2 shows quite different packing patterns in comparison with USQ-2.

3.6. Photovoltaic performance
In order to investigate the effects of the diCN-substituent on the photovoltaic performance of these USQ dyes, BHJ-OPV cells using these USQs as the electron donor material and PC71BM as the electron acceptor material were fabricated, and the device structure was ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/USQ:PC71BM (65 nm)/BCP (6 nm)/Al (100 nm), and the USQ:PC71BM blending ratio was 1:3 in wt%. The relevant photovoltaic data and current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 8a. Obviously, in all the cases, the diCN-USQ-based devices show much higher photovoltaic performance than those of USQ-based devices. All the diCN-USQ-based devices show ∼0.1 V higher Voc than their corresponding reference devices, which should be attributed to the ∼0.1 eV deeper HOMO energy levels of diCN-USQs compared to their corresponding USQ counterparts. It is worth noting that among all three objective devices, the diCN-USQ-3-based one shows the highest Voc of 0.88 V and the smallest energy loss (Eloss) of 0.61 V, despite the lowest bandgap of diCN-USQ-3 among all three objective compounds (1.49 vs. 1.61 or 1.53 eV).

In addition to the higher Voc, all the objective devices show drastically enhanced Jsc compared to their reference devices (6.01–10.57 vs. 3.14–8.16 mA cm−2). In general, Jsc correlates highly with the light harvesting capability, carrier mobility, and morphology characteristics of the active layer.43,44 To elucidate the origin of the enhanced Jsc in diCN-USQ-devices, the EQE curves of these devices were measured. As shown in Fig. 8b, in the region of 300–800 nm, all the objective devices show much higher EQE values than those of their reference devices, and their integrated values are consistent with the Jsc from the J–V curves. Taking into consideration that the integration area of the absorption spectra of the active layers in the objective and reference devices are slightly different (AdiCN-USQ/AUSQ: 1.18, 1.10, and 0.87, respectively), while there are large differences in the Jsc values (JdiCN-USQ/JUSQ: 1.91, 1.76, and 1.22), it is rational to correlate the increased Jsc highly with the different charge transport and/or film morphological properties.
To verify this conjecture, the hole mobility of the active layers were measured via a space charge limited current (SCLC) method. As depicted in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and Table 2, the hole mobility of the USQ:PC71BM blended layers was calculated to be 8.51 × 10−7, 4.47 × 10−6, and 5.13 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for USQ-1–3-based thin films, and 9.33 × 10−7, 1.66 × 10−6, and 4.26 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for diCN-USQ-1–3-based thin films in sequence. The similar hole-mobility values of the active layers in the objective and reference devices implied that the difference in charge-transporting properties should not act as the dominant factor accounting for the increased Jsc in the objective devices.
As the morphological character of the active layers is the other key factor influencing the device performance, water contact angle measurements were carried out to investigate the surface energy properties of these SQ dyes in the thin film state. As shown in Fig. 9, the water contact angles were determined to be 84.5° for USQ-1, 88.5° for USQ-2, and 87.5° for USQ-3, but 90° for diCN-USQ-1-2 and 89° for diCN-USQ-3. Taking into consideration that the water contact angle of the PC71BM thin film is 94°, the larger contact angle of the target compound relative to its reference compound suggests that diCN-USQs may show better compatibility with PCBM than USQs. Additionally, based on our previous findings that thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis might act as a facile method to preliminarily forecast the compatibility between PCBM and donor materials bearing similar molecular skeletons, the smaller difference in Rf between the donor compound and PC71BM, and the smaller phase separation size in the [6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)/donor blend films,31 TLC tests were carried on these USQs and PC71BM using CH2Cl2 as the eluent. As depicted in Fig. 10a, the Rf value is 0, 0.06, and 0.18 for USQ-1–3, but 0.35, 0.53, and 0.69 for diCN-USQ-1–3, respectively. As the Rf value of PC71BM is as high as 1.0, the much higher Rf values of diCN-USQs than those of their corresponding USQs implied that diCN-USQs may show better compatibility with PC71BM than their corresponding USQs, and hence smaller phase domain size might be expected in diCN-USQ-based blend films. Subsequently, the morphological characteristics of the SQ/PC71BM blended active layers were investigated through transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results indicated that in all the cases, the diCN-USQ-based blend films display much smaller phase separation sizes than their reference samples (videFig. 10b, the relatively dark and bright regions indicate the PCBM-rich and SQ-rich regions, respectively), which confirmed our conclusion that diCN substitution can alter their compatibility with PCBM by changing the molecular dipole moment, and then their arrangement and surface energy. Note that this experimental observation is consistent with the expectation derived from TLC tests. Taking into consideration that the exciton diffusion length of squaraine dyes is generally quite short (ca. 1–10 nm),45 the relatively small phase separation size within these blend films should be propitious to the diffusion processes of excitons to the donor/acceptor interfaces, leading to increased Jsc.

Owing to the simultaneously enhanced Voc and Jsc, all the diCN-USQ-based OSCs are observed to show much higher PCE values (1.32–4.37%) than their corresponding USQ-based reference devices (0.53–2.88%). Upon thermal annealing, the PCE of the diCN-USQ-based devices are all further enhanced. By adding a hydroxyl group, diCN-USQ-2 exhibits a better PCE than that of diCN-USQ-1 (1.91% vs. 1.46%). Note that, based on the better PCE of USQ-3, diCN-USQ-3 exhibits the best photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 4.58%.
4. Conclusions
In summary, three central diCN-substituted typed-C squaraines were successfully obtained by modifying the synthesis strategy. From the results of UV-Vis absorption and CV measurements, it can be concluded that the introduction of central diCN-substitution can decrease the material bandgap and HOMO energy level; DFT calculations demonstrate that introduction of central diCN-substitution can increase the molecular dipole moment as well as change the direction, which further significantly changes molecular packing patterns and the surface energy of the USQ derivatives; the TEM results indicate that introduction of central diCN-substitution can improve the miscibility between diCN-USQ and PC71BM. Consequently, the bulk-heterojunction organic photovoltaic devices (BHJ-OPVs) based on diCN-USQ all exhibit better photovoltaic performance with higher Voc and Jsc in comparison with that of the reference compounds. Note that the PCE of the diCN-USQ-3 based device is high up to 4.58%, which is the highest PCE for OSCs of central substituted squaraines. These results indicate that designing new type-C molecules may be a new way to obtain photovoltaic SQs with high performance.
