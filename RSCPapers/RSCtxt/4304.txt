    , Accepted 14th July 2022First published on 14th July 2022AbstractSeveral strategies have been considered in search of more efficient organic materials for charge transfer in photovoltaic devices. Among them, the integration of donor–acceptor (D–A) functional units on a conjugated copolymer has been widely applied. In this framework, we evaluated four terpolymers made up of donor moieties derived from 9,9-dioctylfluorene and 9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-9H-carbazole combined with 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, the acceptor moiety, in different monomer ratios and polymerization routes (block and random microstructures). The preferred molecular orientation and charge transfer dynamics of the polymeric films were assessed by near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) and resonant Auger electron spectroscopy (RAES) around the sulfur K-edge. Charge transfer times (τCT) were estimated by the Core–Hole Clock (CHC) method. Films with a high degree of organization were identified for the block terpolymer and random terpolymers with uneven amounts of donor units, showing a preferred orientation of the benzothiadiazole (BT) molecular plane parallel to the substrate surface. The values of τCT measured for all terpolymers were higher than those for typical polymers used in photovoltaic devices, which is not desirable for this type of optoelectronic application, but this may be correlated to the strong acceptor character of BT, the unit probed. To investigate the effect of film formation on the excited state behavior, steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements were also conducted. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to characterize the surface chemical composition of the terpolymer films. Based on the spectroscopic data the block copolymer appears to be the most suitable for the desired application.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are of great interest due to advantages such as light weight, low cost, reduced carbon footprint of manufacturing, high flexibility, and large-scale manufacturing compatibility. Moreover, these devices comprise thin layers, requiring relatively small quantities of materials.
In the last years, the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer was considered the most promising configuration for PSCs.1 In this configuration, a blend of two components, usually a polymer (electron donor, a p-type semiconductor) and a small molecule (acceptor, n-type semiconductor), forms a bicontinuous interpenetrating network with a great number of p–n junctions. Therefore, the development of semiconductor terpolymers is a good approach to improve many parameters of the BHJ active layer, such as miscibility, light absorption, deep energy levels, charge mobility, solubility, efficiency, and durability.2,3 Following the strategy of using conjugated donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating copolymers as the donor component of the BHJ,4 these materials incorporate three functional monomeric units (e.g., one donor and two acceptors) in their polymeric backbones.
Many authors have recently reported syntheses of new terpolymers for organic solar cell application with excellent performance. Fan and coworkers reported a D–A–A terpolymer comprising bithiophene as the donor moiety and a benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione and thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole as the acceptor units. The terpolymer-based PSC achieved a promising power conversion effciency (PCE) of 8.1%.2 Moreover, terpolymer derivatives of the well-established PBDB–TF copolymer (also known as PM6) have also yielded remarkable results. There are examples of introducing functionalized benzodithiophene5 as the extra donor unit; and double-ester-substituted thiophene6 and s-tetrazine derivatives7 as the extra acceptor unit. When paired with the Y6 molecule in the device's BHJ, the terpolymer-based PSCs reached PCE values over the 16%-mark, exceeding PBDB–TF/Y6 original devices.5–7
Fluorene and carbazole monomers are commonly adopted as donor units of D–A conjugated copolymers for PSCs.4 Due to the presence of the tricyclic unit in fluorene, the rigid biphenyl ring generates greater planarity, and the C9 carbon allows functionalization, improving solubility. In addition, they have a low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, thus generating greater hole mobility, improving the Voc (open circuit voltage) and Jsc (short circuit current density) parameters.8 The carbazole unit is rich in electrons and binds to the electron-deficient fullerene derivatives (common acceptor component in BHJ), allowing the donor–acceptor arrangement of the BHJ. As a result, it introduces the intramolecular effect of charge transfer, which increases spectrum absorption.9 As for acceptor units, benzothiadiazole (BT) is a strong acceptor moiety and stands out as the most selected unit for this function in D–A polymers.4
One promising advance toward widening the absorption of the solar spectrum is block and random terpolymers. The synthesis of a block terpolymer can provide an optimized structure by creating well-defined macromolecules with molecular weight control, suggesting that the block synthesis strategy can produce more ordered polymers.10 On the other hand, random terpolymerization is a route that enhances physicochemical properties, allowing to obtain broad absorption, low-lying HOMO level, high charge mobility, and good solubility by varying monomers ratio.11–13
Although promising advances when using the terpolymer approach were recently verified, their successful application in photovoltaic devices is still subject to many investigations, especially related to the morphology of the polymeric film. Film morphology impacts many important factors to the device's efficiency, such as recombination rate, charge separation, and mobility.14 And at the smallest length scale of the BHJ, molecular orientation plays a decisive role in interchain charge transport due to chain packing.14,15 For these reasons, a more thorough understanding of the details of the terpolymer film morphologies is essential for enhancing charge transport. X-ray absorption and resonant Auger decay spectroscopies are synchrotron radiation-based techniques that can be combined for this purpose.16–18
Here, we assess the preferential molecular orientation of four D1–A–D2–A terpolymers (three random and one block copolymer) with possible application in organic photovoltaic cells based on the dependence of X-ray absorption on the radiation incidence angle. The polymers are made up of 9,9-dioctylfluorene and 9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-9H-carbazole derivatives as donor units and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole as the acceptor. We identified a preferred orientation of the BT molecular plane parallel to the substrate surface and the influence of the copolymer type and donor units’ proportion on the film organization through the absorption dichroism. In addition, charge transfer times (τCT) were estimated by the Core–Hole Clock (CHC) method,19,20 and demonstrated slower charge transfer dynamics than other common polymers applied in PSCs, such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), which we believe is due to the strong acceptor character of the BT unit. The polymeric films were further characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS); steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements were also conducted.
Experimental
Materials
Four terpolymers composed of two electron donor moieties – fluorene-derived monomer (M1) and carbazole-derived monomer (M3) – and one electron acceptor moiety – benzothiadiazole-derived monomer (M2) – were synthesized as reported in a previous work of Santos and co-workers.21 They differ by the type of copolymer synthesized (random or block copolymer) and monomer proportion, summarized in Table 1. The structural formulas of both copolymer types are illustrated in Fig. 1. Fluoride tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (Flexitec Eletrônica Orgânica, Brazil) with average sheet resistance ≤5 Ω sq−1 was used as substrate.

Sample preparation
FTO substrates were first cleaned by sequential sonication in Hellmanex solution, deionized water, isopropanol, and deionized water again for 10 min each and then dried under a nitrogen stream. Next, the terpolymer solutions (chloroform, 0.5 mg mL−1) were spun onto precleaned FTO substrates at 900 rpm for 180 s, followed by 1200 rpm for 30 s.
Measurements
XPS analyses were carried out using the Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV). Using a 600-micron spot, survey and high-resolution spectra were acquired with a pass energy of 100 eV and 25 eV, respectively. Energy calibration was performed using Au 4f photoemission line at 84.0 eV. The peak fitting process was performed with the Avantage software (version 5.982).
Near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) and resonant Auger electron spectroscopy (RAES) experiments were carried out at the SXS beamline of the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS), using a Si(111) double-crystal monochromator. S K-edge absorption spectra were recorded in the total electron yield (TEY) mode, in which the sample drain current was normalized by the current of a thin gold grid placed in the photon path before reaching the sample. The main transition of the polythiophene spectrum22 was used for energy calibration. Angular dependence of the absorption spectra was evaluated by varying the radiation's angle of incidence from 20° up to 90°. Using a hemispherical electron energy analyzer with a pass energy of 20 eV, sulfur KL2,3L2,3 Auger decay spectra were acquired for a set of relevant NEXAFS photon energies. Peak fitting of RAES spectra was achieved by using linear combinations of Gaussian and Lorentzian profile shape functions, along with a Shirley function for background correction.
Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was measured with an Edinburgh Instruments Lifespec 2time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) operating in reverse mode. The samples were periodically excited with an Edinburgh Instruments EPL405 picoseconds pulsed diode laser (λexc = 405 nm, Δλexc = ±5 nm). The samples emission was measured at their maxima as determined using steady-state PL (Δλem = 20 nm). The TRPL decays obtained were reconvoluted with the instrument response time. Fitting was carried out using a single exponential decay: (1)where τ is the lifetime of excited charge carriers in the fluorophore and is equal to the inverse of the sum of the radiative kr and non-radiative knr recombination rates.
Steady-state photoluminescence was measured with an Horiba Fluoromax-4 fluorometer. The samples emission was measured between 500 and 800 nm (Δλem = ±1 nm, 1 nm step, λexc = 400 nm, Δλexc = ±1 nm).
Absorbance was measured between 350 and 600 nm with a PerkinElmer Lambda 9 Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer.
Results and discussion
Surface characterization
The surface chemistry characterization of the terpolymers films was achieved by XPS measurements. Core level emissions detected in the XPS survey spectra, Fig. 2, indicate the presence of C, N, and S from the polymers along with significant O and Si contributions. The detection of these two last elements suggests a non-uniform polymeric coating of the FTO substrates. Moreover, oxidative degradation of organic films, as a consequence of air exposure, can also introduce oxygen into the sample.23Table 2 compares the atomic percent (at%) estimated from the survey spectra with those derived from each terpolymer chemical structure. When disregarding O and Si contributions, all terpolymers show compatible values with the reference stoichiometries. Although the differences between the stoichiometries of the terpolymers are subtle, some are noticeable in the experimental data, such as the slightly higher amount of N in P3 due to the higher carbazole content.

High-resolution spectra at the C 1s, N 1s, and S 2p core-level regions of the four samples are displayed in Fig. 3. The most distinctive features in each region are common to all terpolymer films, as expected for copolymers comprising the same monomers. This result also implies that any synthetic differences between the copolymerization processes did not affect the expected end products.
 Fig. 3  C 1s, N 1s and S 2p high resolution XPS spectra of P1, P2, P3 and P4 terpolymers. Minor contributions in C 1s spectra are highlighted in the insets. 
Two intense contributions dominate the C 1s high-resolution spectra: the first one centered around 284.6 eV can be assigned to carbons in double covalent bonds (CC); the second at 285.0 eV is associated with carbons in single bonds between other carbons or hydrogens (C–C/C–H).24 According to the terpolymers' chemical structure, the proportion between the sp2 and sp3 chemical states should be around 1:1.10. As demonstrated by Table 3, the surface analysis yields larger ratios (up to 1:1.30) due to higher C–C/C–H at%, along with a lower CC at% for most of the polymers. P3 is the only exception; its CC portion measured is actually higher than its chemical structure predicts, compensating the C–C/C–H deviation. The observed imbalances between these two chemical states probably result from mild oxidative degradation of the film surface – attested by the presence of oxidized carbon states highlighted in the insets – and adventitious carbon contamination, both caused by air exposure.

A third relevant feature also appears in C 1s spectra, around 286.0 eV, related to C–N chemical states found in the carbazole and benzothiadiazole subunit structures.24 The amount of C–N in the terpolymers varies with the proportion of carbazole-derived monomer in their structure. And this variation is noticeable in the surface analysis, indicating that the terpolymers are, in fact, different and were successfully synthesized and deposited.
The same can be observed at the N 1s high-resolution spectra, in which the proportion between the CN–S contribution from the benzothiadiazole unit23,25–29 and the N–(C)3 from the carbazole24,29 varies accordingly. Again, the low-intensity oxidized states were fitted and may also be contributing to the at% deviation from reference numbers.
Finally, the S 2p high-resolution spectra present only one significant doublet structure, with the 2p3/2 peak at 165.5 eV and the 2p1/2 peak at 166.7 eV, characteristic of the S–N chemical state from the benzothiadiazole unit.23,26–28 As observed at all other core levels, minor contributions, probably related to oxidized states, are present. However, the surface oxidation of the films appears to be smooth and does not compromise their qualities.
Molecular orientation
Sulfur K-edge NEXAFS spectra of the terpolymers are presented in Fig. 4. Since benzothiadiazole is the only sulfur-containing moiety present, the features observed in the spectra are mostly related to the photoabsorption processes of this specific unit. Hence, all terpolymers in the series have basically the same absorption profile, which could be interpreted as a fingerprint of the BT unit in this type of material. The second derivative of the spectra indicates three main features (grey-shaded areas): A1 at 2472.0 eV, A2 at 2473.8 eV, and A3 at 2475.4 eV. The first two are compatible with the pair of strong peaks observed in the spectrum of benzothiadiazole in the gas-phase, which are assigned to 1s → π*(SN) and 1s → σ*(S–N) transitions, respectively.30 For the gas phase molecular system, there is also a third (and weak) peak appearing as a shoulder of the σ* resonance, assigned as a transition to a Rydberg state (1s → 4p).30 Despite being in the same region, the A3 feature is probably not related to such a transition, since these types of states are rarely observed in condensed systems due to their large size.31,32 So it's not completely clear which transition is associated with this particular feature. It presents opposite behavior to the A2 peak, but a theoretical approach to the polymer's photoabsorption spectrum would be necessary to clarify its assignment. However, the π* and σ* resonances are sufficient to draw conclusions about the preferred molecular orientation in the series.

Fig. 5 shows the angle dependence of each terpolymer absorption spectrum. In order to better visualize the trends, it is also presented the intensity difference between the spectrum of a given incident angle and the grazing incidence (20°) spectrum. Therefore, it can be observed that all samples present almost the same pattern of dichroism, in which the intensity of the A1 peak decreases with the increase of the incidence angle, while the A2 peak has the opposite behavior. Considering the correlation between the spatial orientation of π and σ molecular orbitals and the angle dependence of the absorption spectra, the observed pattern reflects a BT molecular plane preferably oriented parallel to the substrate surface, also known as face-on configuration.

Although all terpolymers films have the same preferred orientation, apparently the extent of this order is not the same for all of them. The dichroism observed for P1 is noticeably less pronounced than the other series members. This suggests a less ordered film, at least when compared to the others. The same deposition method was applied to all films studied; thus, differences in the degree of ordering must arise from chemical and structural aspects of each terpolymer, such as the monomer proportion and the type of polymer. Therefore, it seems that a block copolymer, such as P4, is more likely to form a well-ordered film based on its dichroism magnitude, corroborating what is expected in the literature.9 In addition, the proportion of donor units significantly impacts in the organization of random copolymer films. An unbalanced proportion of donor units, as in P2 and P3, appears to provide more ordered films. We believe that the fact that the polymer is dominated by one of the donor unit, P2 with the highest contribution of fluorene-derived monomer (M1) and P3 of carbazole-derived monomer (M3), facilitate a preferential ordering of the film.
Charge transfer dynamics
The charge transfer times (τCT) of all polymers – P3HT included for comparative purposes – were estimated by applying the CHC method. For this, the resonant (IRes) and normal Auger (INA) contributions were evaluated by deconvolution of sulfur KL2,3L2,3 resonant Auger decay spectra taken at some relevant photon energies according to the NEXAFS spectrum of the terpolymer. The τCT corresponding to the resonance maximum in the terpolymer absorption spectra, peak A2, are listed in Table 4.

All terpolymers show τCT values higher than 12.7 fs, the method upper limit for sulfur KL2,3L2,3 decay, due to a low normal Auger (NA) contribution in their RAES spectra, as demonstrated by Fig. 6. Consequently, the values are not comparable. However, this result attests to a slower charge transfer dynamics than typical polymers applied in photovoltaic devices, such as P3HT, whose times are usually shorter than 12 fs.16,33 The sulfur KL2,3L2,3 Auger decay spectrum shows a low charge transfer rate when probing the BT unit, which may indicate a low charge transfer susceptibility that may be related to its strong acceptor character.4 This can be explained by the fact that the unoccupied energy levels probed are not sufficiently delocalized to promote efficient charge transfer. For instance, Damas et al. reported in a density functional theory (DFT) study of a similar oligomeric system large torsional angles between BT and adjacent fluorene donor units, which negatively affects the oligomer molecular planarity and electron delocalization. The authors also observed well-localized states around the least unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the oligomer formed mainly by the unoccupied orbital of the BT units.34

Optical characterization

Fig. 7 summarizes the optical characterization of the most ordered terpolymeric films, including their absorbance, steady-state photoluminescence, time-resolved photoluminescence, TRLP lifetime and absorbance-corrected PL intensity. P2 and P4 present an absorption front at ca. 525 nm compared to P3, closer to 550 nm. All polymers have fairly broad absorption bands, particularly P2 and P3. P2 has the highest absorbance, although a slight variation in film thickness between samples may be consistent with the observed photoluminescence emission offset. Although P4 is the less absorptive sample, it has the highest PL emission. Adding that to its very short carrier lifetime as measured using TRPL, it suggests that P4 has a higher radiative recombination rate than P2 and P3. When switching the monomer proportion from P2 to P3, increased carrier lifetime and emission intensity are observed.

Conclusions
Terpolymers made up of donor moieties derived from 9,9-dioctylfluorene and 9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-9H-carbazole combined with 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole – the acceptor moiety – in different monomer ratios and polymerization routes (block and random microstructures) were evaluated by spectroscopic techniques to access chemical composition, film morphology, charge transfer dynamics and photoluminescence properties. The block copolymer with an equal proportion of donor moieties (P4) and random copolymers with unbalanced proportions (P2 and P3) formed more organized films based on their dichroism as measured by NEXAFS, showing a BT molecular plane oriented preferably parallel to the substrate surface (face-on configuration). Of all the terpolymers studied, P4 was the one with the highest ordering. Estimated charge transfer times are much longer than that observed for P3HT, for example, a well-known polymer used as a donor in PSCs. This result reflects the different donor and acceptor character of the probed units, thiophene and BT respectively, commonly used in D–A copolymers. Measurements by TRPL suggest that P4 has a higher radiative recombination rate than P2 and P3. And a decrease in the fluorene/carbazole ratio from P2 to P3 promotes a rise of the terpolymeric film's carrier lifetime and emission intensity. Finally, the integrity of the terpolymer films was verified by photoelectron spectroscopy. From the spectroscopic data, the block copolymer proves to be the most suitable for the desired application.
