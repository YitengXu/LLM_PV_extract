    , Accepted 4th October 2019First published on 9th November 2019AbstractAntimony selenide (Sb2Se3) thin films are attractive light-absorbing materials used in low-cost and highly efficient thin-film solar cells. In order to increase the efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells based on a tin oxide (SnO2) buffer layer, an ultrathin cadmium sulfide (CdS) film was introduced at the interface between the fluorine doped SnO2 glass (FTO) and the SnO2 film. Different thicknesses of the CdS/SnO2 compound buffer layers were used to form p–n junctions with the Sb2Se3 film. The ultrathin CdS layer not only increased the carrier connection and transport, but also decreased the conduction band offset and grain boundary density of the Sb2Se3 film. Lastly, an efficiency of 5.27% for the FTO/CdS (10 nm)/SnO2 (40 nm)/Sb2Se3/Au solar cells was obtained, which is higher than the reported highest efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells based on a SnO2 buffer layer.
1. Introduction
Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) thin films are light-absorbing materials used for the low-cost, large scale production of highly efficient thin-film solar cells. These materials are composed of abundant, nontoxic, inexpensive constituent elements, and have a fair carrier mobility and also an ideal band gap of approximately 1.03 (indirect) and 1.17 eV (direct), with a predicted maximum theoretical efficiency of over 30%.1,2 As a result, Sb2Se3 is a promising alternative for existing chalcogenides, such as copper zinc tin sulfide (Cu2ZnSnS4, also called CZTS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cells.3,4 However, the highest reported efficiency for a Sb2Se3 solar cell is 7.6% for an FTO/CdS/Sb2Se3/Au structure,5 and 9.2% efficiency for a Mo/Sb2Se3/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Ag structure.6 Previously, various methods have been used to fabricate Sb2Se3 solar cells. These include rapid thermal evaporation (RTE),7 vapor transport deposition (VTD),8 close space sublimation (CSS),9 evaporation,10 and sputtering.11 Until now, most of the Sb2Se3 solar cells fabricated using the above methods have been based on the CdS buffer layer, which is toxic and is an environmentally damaging material.
In order to reduce the amount of cadmium-rich waste generated, other buffer layers have been used to replace the CdS film such as zinc oxide (ZnO),12 titanium oxide (TiO2),13 and tin oxide (SnO2).14 Currently, the maximum efficiencies for Sb2Se3 solar cells with ZnO, TiO2, and SnO2 buffer layers are 6.0%, 5.6%, and 3.05%, respectively. The efficiency of cells containing a SnO2 buffer layer is far below the efficiency of the others even though SnO2 is a low-cost, non-toxic, highly stable semiconductor with a large bandgap, high mobility, high carrier concentration, reduced mismatch and better electronic transportation with fluorine doped SnO2 glass (FTO).15 Originally, Lu et al. reported that the efficiency of the SnO2/Sb2Se3 solar cells was mainly limited by the surface roughness and crystallinity.14 However, in our previous work,16 the SnO2 film prepared by a simple solution method had a good surface roughness and crystallinity, but the efficiency was still lower than the other types of buffer layers. Therefore, we suspect that the low efficiency may result from other reasons. Many factors can affect the efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells, especially the suitable crystallographic orientation of the Sb2Se3 film which will determine the carrier transport of the device. After conducting further experiments, we found that the Sb2Se3 film based on the SnO2 film presents a stacking growth manner which will limit the carrier transport of the device. In addition, it was also found that the efficiency of the SnO2/Sb2Se3 solar cells is limited by the small grain size (higher grain boundary density) and unsuitable energy band structures. Solving those three problems are the key to improving the efficiency of the SnO2/Sb2Se3 solar cells. As we know, double buffer layers have been used in CdTe solar cells to increase the efficiency of solar cells, such as CdS/Cd1−xZnxS16 and ZnO/CdS17 buffer layers. Therefore, in this paper an ultrathin CdS film was introduced at the interface between the FTO and SnO2 film. To our surprise, all of the problems were solved by introducing the ultrathin CdS film at the interface between the FTO and SnO2 film.
In this study, an ultrathin CdS film, fabricated using the chemical bath deposition (CBD) method, was introduced at the interface between the FTO and the SnO2 film. It was found that upon addition of the ultrathin CdS film the growth pattern of the Sb2Se3 film changed from stacking to columnar growth, decreasing the conduction band offset and increasing the grain sizes of the Sb2Se3 film by adding a thin CdS film. The new buffer layer not only reduces the use of cadmium sulfide, but also improves the efficiency of the SnO2/Sb2Se3 solar cells. Different thicknesses of the CdS buffer layer have been used as the interface layer. All efforts have been made to reduce the thickness of the CdS layer. Lastly, a 5.27% efficiency for the FTO/CdS (10 nm)/SnO2(40 nm)/Sb2Se3/Au solar cells has been obtained, and the efficiency is higher than the reported highest Sb2Se3 solar cells based on a pure SnO2 film.
2. Experimental
2.1 Fabrication of the CdS/SnO2 laminate buffer layer
The CdS film in this study was deposited using the CBD method. CdSO4 (99.99% Aladdin), CH4N2S (99.0% Aladdin), and NH3·H2O (25–28% Shanghai Ling Feng Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) were used. The concentration of CdSO4 and CH4N2S were 15 mmol L−1 and 75 mmol L−1, respectively. The CBD process was carried out at 65 °C in a solution consisting of 250 ml deionized water, 15 ml CdSO4 solution, 15 ml CH4N2S solution and 19 ml NH3·H2O solution. The total process used for the CBD of CdS was similar to that used in previous reports.17,18 Following the deposition of the CdS film, the SnO2 film was deposited using the spin-coating method at 5000 rpm for 30 s (15% tin oxide in colloidal dispersion in H2O, Alfa Aesar) to fabricate different thicknesses of the SnO2 layer. The layer thickness of the SnO2 is dependent on the number of times the spin-coater is repeated. Finally, the sample was annealed on a hot plate at 150 °C for 30 min. The CdS film for the Sb2Se3/CdS solar cells was also fabricated using the CBD method. After the CBD method the CdS film was treated using CdCl2 solution and was annealed in air at 400 °C for 15 min.
2.2 Solar cell fabrication
The Sb2Se3 solar cells were fabricated using a standard device structure of FTO/CdS/SnO2/Sb2Se3/Au. The CdS/SnO2 laminate buffer layer was fabricated as stated above, following which the Sb2Se3 film was deposited onto the surface of the buffer layer. The preparation methods for Sb2Se3 used in this study are consistent with those used in our previous work.19 After the deposition of the Sb2Se3 film, 100 nm-thick gold back-contact electrodes with an area of 0.0225 cm2 were installed using the evaporation method. A detailed schematic diagram of the fabrication process of the Sb2Se3 solar cell based CdS/SnO2 buffer layers is shown in Fig. 1.

2.3 Characterization
The structure of the SnO2, SnO2/CdS, CdS and Sb2Se3 films was observed using an X-ray diffractometer system (Rigaku D/MAX-2500). The morphology of the films was analyzed with an S4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, Japan). The surface roughness of all of the films was measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Nanoman VS). The optical transmittance of the films was measured using a UV-vis-2250 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The C–V was measured using the Keysight Precision LCR Meter (Keysight E4980AL) in darkness at room temperature at 10 kHz. The efficiency of the solar cells was measured using a I–V tester (Cell tester) under AM1.5 global spectrum conditions. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was detected by a photovoltaic characterization system (PV Measurements QEXL)
3. Results and discussion
In order to investigate the influence of adding the ultrathin CdS film onto the SnO2 film, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and AFM have been used to test the three buffer layers. Fig. 2a shows the XRD pattern of the CdS/SnO2 buffer layer. It can be seen that the CdS/SnO2 buffer layer is a mixed phase which includes the CdS and SnO2 phase. In addition, compared with the XRD patterns of pure SnO2 and the CdS layer (Fig. S1, ESI†), the CdS/SnO2 layer is well orientated and crystalline. Fig. 2b–e shows the XPS patterns of the SnO2, CdS/SnO2 and CdS buffer layer. It can be seen that the valence state of the Sn, O and Cd elements are consistent with those reported previously,20 except S, which is in the +4 state, which is different from the pure CdS layer. According to the previous report, a new phase CdSOx may have formed during the fabrication process.17,18 As we know, the test depth of XPS is lower than 10 nm, meaning the signal for CdS could not be detected. According to the XPS data for the three buffer layers, we suspect that the CdS and SnO2 may spread to each other and form a new buffer layer. Fig. 2f shows the transmittance spectra of the three buffer layers. As shown in the figure, all of the three buffer layers have a high transmission. Compared with the three buffer layers, the transmission of the SnO2 film is higher than the others in visible light. In addition, the transmission of CdS/SnO2 is higher than the pure CdS layer in the range of 300–600 nm. The increase in transmission between 300–600 nm may have resulted from the formation of CdSOx. In the range of 600–900 nm the transmission of the CdS/SnO2 and CdS buffer layers are equivalent. Therefore, the overall transmission of the CdS/SnO2 buffer layer is higher than that of the pure CdS layer. The band gaps of the three buffer layers are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), and the band gaps of SnO2, CdS/SnO2 and CdS are 2.45, 3.57 and 3.97 eV, respectively. It can be seen that the band gap of SnO2 has decreased upon the addition of the ultrathin thin CdS film. The decrease in the band gap is mainly due to the formation of CdSOx which corresponds to the previous reports.21

Fig. 3a–c shows the SEM images of the three buffer layers. Fig. 3a and c shows the SEM images of the pure SnO2 film and the CdS film, it can be seen that both films present good crystallinity and no heterogenous phase is found on the surface. Fig. 3b shows the SEM images of the CdS/SnO2 buffer layers. It also presents a good crystallinity and compactness. However, compared with the pure SnO2 film, there are many white heterogenous phases on the surface of the film, which may be the new phase CdSOx and result from the diffusion of CdS. The surface roughness of the three buffer layers was also measured using AFM. Fig. 3d–f shows the AFM images of the buffer layers. Compared with the three AFM images, it can be seen that there are some protrusions on the surface of the CdS/SnO2 layer, which are consistent with the SEM results. In addition, the values for the surface roughness of the three buffer layers are 9.2, 9.7 and 12.8 nm, respectively. It was observed that the surface roughness of the SnO2 film increased with the addition of a thin CdS film. The increased surface roughness may result from the protrusions on the surface.

According to previous work,7 the columnar growth manner of the Sb2Se3 film can be observed using XRD. It often presents as the intensity of the (120) and (221) diffraction peaks. If the intensity of (221) is higher than the (120) diffraction, the Sb2Se3 film will have grown in a columnar manner and exhibit better carrier transport.7Fig. 4a shows the XRD patterns of Sb2Se3 films based on the SnO2 film (the SnO2 film was prepared using different methods). Note that the intensity of the (120) diffraction peaks is higher than that of the (221) diffraction peaks, indicating that the Sb2Se3 film grew in a stacking manner on the SnO2 films and has a reduced carrier transport ability. Fig. 4b shows the XRD patterns of the Sb2Se3 films based on different buffer layers. For the Sb2Se3 films based on SnO2 buffer layers, the intensity of the (120) diffraction peaks is much stronger than that of the (221) diffraction peaks. After adding the thin CdS film onto the FTO substrate, the intensity of the (120) diffraction decreased, similar to the Sb2Se3 films deposited on the thick CdS film. The XRD results show that after the addition of a thin CdS film, the Sb2Se3 films present columnar growth instead of a stacking growth pattern.6 In order to further confirm that the growth pattern of the Sb2Se3 film has been changed after the addition of the ultrathin CdS layer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the distance between the lattice lines. It can be seen in Fig. 4c that the distances between the lattice lines are 0.31 nm, which corresponds to the (221) plane. The XRD patterns of the Sb2Se3 films based on the different thicknesses of the CdS/SnO2 layer are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Note that the intensity of the (221) diffraction peaks is higher than that of the (120) diffraction peaks, which indicates that adding a CdS layer can give crystalline orientation optimization and increase the carrier transport of the Sb2Se3 solar cells.6

In order to verify the growth patterns of the Sb2Se3 film based on the three buffer layers, SEM was applied to measure the cross-sectional morphology of the Sb2Se3 films. Fig. 4d shows the cross-sectional SEM images of the Sb2Se3 films based on the pure SnO2 layers. The Sb2Se3 film based on SnO2 film was compact. In addition, The Sb2Se3 films based on the SnO2 film present a stacking growth pattern, which is consistent with the XRD results. Fig. 4e shows the cross-sectional SEM images of the Sb2Se3 films based on a CdS/SnO2 buffer layer. By adding a thin CdS film, the Sb2Se3 films show a columnar growth pattern which will increase the carrier transport of the device. Fig. 4f shows the cross-sectional SEM images of the Sb2Se3 film based on the thick CdS film. The result shows that the Sb2Se3 film based on the thick CdS film presents columnar growth, but the crystallinity of Sb2Se3 seems lower than that of the Sb2Se3 film based on the CdS/SnO2 film. The poorer crystalline nature may result from the higher surface roughness of the CdS film. By comparing the three films, the crystallinity of the Sb2Se3 films based on the CdS/SnO2 buffer layers is higher than the others, implying that the CdS/SnO2 buffer layer not only aids in the development of columnar growth, but also increases the crystallinity of the Sb2Se3 films. Fig. S4–S7 (ESI†) show the cross-sectional SEM images of the Sb2Se3 films based on the different thicknesses of the CdS/SnO2 buffer layer. All of the Sb2Se3 films show columnar growth when based on the CdS/SnO2 buffer layers. Furthermore, this can be seen clearly when the thicknesses of CdS and SnO2 are 10 and 40 nm, respectively. The Sb2Se3 film shows the best columnar growth manner and the largest grain size. Cross-sectional energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping has also been performed for the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the CdS/SnO2 buffer layers (Fig. S8, ESI†). It can be seen clearly that the structure of the CdS/SnO2/Sb2Se3 solar cells and all elements are distributed uniformly over the buffer layer. In addition, the mapping result also shows that the CdS has diffused into the SnO2 film. This result is consistent with our XPS results.

Fig. 5a shows the structure of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the CdS/SnO2 layer. From the bottom to the top, the order is FTO, CdS, SnO2, Sb2Se3 and gold. The type of conductivity of the CdS and SnO2 is n-type, while the Sb2Se3 is p-type. Fig. 5b shows the photocurrent density voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 1.

By adding the thin CdS film under the SnO2 layer, the Voc, Jsc and FF all increase, and the efficiency improves from 2.33% to 5.27%. In addition, the efficiency of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the CdS/SnO2 layer is also higher compared to that of films based on a pure CdS layer owing to the obvious increase of Jsc. Fig. 5c shows the EQE of the three buffer layer samples. In the visible range, all three solar cells have good absorption. By adding a thin CdS layer, the EQE of the Sb2Se3 solar cells is much higher than that of the pure SnO2 solar cells in the visible range, therefore we infer that the increase in the Jsc is mainly due to this increased absorption in the visible range for the CdS/SnO2 solar cells. In addition, the EQE of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on CdS/SnO2 cells is higher than that of the pure CdS cells in the range of 300–1000 nm. This may be the reason for the higher Jsc of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on CdS/SnO2 solar cells than those based on the pure CdS layer. The increase in the long wavelength may result from the high quality of the Sb2Se3 film and long depletion zone width. In order to verify the higher depletion zone width, the C–V measurement was used to test the depletion zone width of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the three buffer layers. Fig. 5d shows the C–V of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the three buffer layers. Compared to the pure SnO2 and CdS buffer layer, the Vbi increased with the addition of a thin CdS film. In addition, the Vbi of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on CdS/SnO2 and CdS are very similar, which is consistent with the similar Voc. The NC–V result (Fig. 5e) indicates that adding an ultrathin CdS film can increase the depletion zone width of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the SnO2 film. In addition, the depletion zone width of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the CdS/SnO2 layer (330.81 nm) is higher than that based on the pure CdS (313.07 nm) and the SnO2 (82 nm) film, which indicates a better carrier collection for the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the CdS/SnO2 film than those based on the pure SnO2 and CdS film. The increased depletion zone width is consistent with the EQE result. It can also be found that the carrier concentration of the Sb2Se3 film based on the CdS and CdS/SnO2 layer are higher than those based on the pure SnO2 layer. We suspect that the reason for the increased Voc of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the CdS/SnO2 film is the increased carrier concentration. Fig. 5f shows the dark IV result for the Sb2Se3 solar cell based on the SnO2, CdS/SnO2 and CdS films. The result indicates that the Sb2Se3 solar cell based on the CdS/SnO2 film has a lower series resistance and higher ideal factor than the device based on the SnO2 and CdS film. The higher ideal factor results in a better diode quality for the Sb2Se3 solar cell based on a CdS/SnO2 film and a higher FF. The light-soaking stabilities of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the three buffer layers are shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). It can be seen that the SnO2/Sb2Se3 solar cells show a good light-soaking stability compared to the other two buffer layers. The light-soaking stability of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the CdS/SnO2 layers are higher than that of the pure CdS film. The stable performance of the CdS/SnO2/Sb2Se3 devices has promising indications for their potential application.
In order to verify the reproducibility of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the three buffer layers, 15 individual cells were fabricated. Detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. 6. All of the photovoltaic parameters for the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the CdS/SnO2 buffer layer are higher than the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the pure SnO2 buffer layer. The increase in all of the photovoltaic parameters of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the CdS/SnO2 buffer layers is mainly due to the altered growth pattern of the Sb2Se3 films. Sb2Se3 is a one-dimensional structure, and the longitudinal conductivity of a Sb2Se3 film with columnar growth is higher than that of a stacked growth Sb2Se3 film, which will result in better carrier transport and collection.22,23 Comparing the photovoltaic parameters of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the CdS/SnO2 and pure CdS buffer layers, it is apparent that the Voc, Jsc, and FF of the CdS/SnO2 solar cells are all higher than the pure CdS film cells. We postulate that the increased Jsc of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on a CdS/SnO2 buffer layer is mainly due to the increased transmission and higher depletion zone width compared with the pure CdS film, which is shown in Fig. 2f and 5e.
 Fig. 6  Statistics for the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the different buffer layers: Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE. 
In order to further investigate the reason for the increased efficiency of the Sb2Se3 solar cell based on CdS/SnO2 buffer layers, the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) data for the SnO2, CdS/SnO2 and CdS films have been studied (Fig. 7a–c). The energy level diagram patterns according to the UPS data for those films are shown in Fig. 7d–f. Firstly, it can be seen that the SnO2, CdS and CdS/SnO2 layers are all an N-type semiconductor (the Fermi level was closer to the conduction band maxima (CBM) than the valence band maxima (VBM)), while the Sb2Se3 thin film is a P-type semiconductor (the Fermi level was closer to the VBM than the CBM) (Fig. S11, ESI†). By comparing the pure SnO2 film and the CdS/SnO2 film, it was found that the Fermi energy of the CdS/SnO2 film is more closed to the CBM, which means a high carrier concentration for the CdS/SnO2 film. This may be the reason for the increased depletion width. We also hypothesize that the reason for the increased Voc of the CdS/SnO2/Sb2Se3 solar cells is the increasing distance of the Fermi energy split compared to the SnO2/Sb2Se3 solar cells. In addition, the conduction band offset of the CdS/SnO2/Sb2Se3 was 0.03 eV which is smaller than conduction band offset of the SnO2/Sb2Se3 solar cell. The low conduction band offset provides an easier carrier transport in the structure of the CdS/SnO2/Sb2Se3 solar cell and this may be another reason for the increasing efficiency of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the CdS/SnO2 solar cell (the band alignment is shown in Fig. 8). As we know the band gap of SnO2 is higher than that of CdS. Therefore, the structure of the CdS/SnO2/Sb2Se3 solar cells will easily form a barrier between the CdS and SnO2, which will prevent the transportation of the carrier and decrease the efficiency of the Sb2Se3 solar cells. However, in the structure of the CdS/SnO2/Sb2Se3 solar cells the thickness of CdS is very thin and from the XPS data we know that it has already diffused into the SnO2 film. The efficiency and ideal factor also show that the PN junction quality between the 10 nm CdS/Sb2Se3 is very poor (Fig. S12, ESI†). Therefore, we suspect that it is hard for the thin CdS film in this structure to form an ideal junction and will not form a barrier to prevent the transportation of carriers.

The surface SEM images of the Sb2Se3 films based on the three buffer layers are shown in Fig. S13a–c, ESI.† It can be seen that the grain size of the Sb2Se3 film based on the SnO2 films is smaller than the Sb2Se3 film based on the pure CdS film. However, with the addition of the ultrathin CdS film, the grain size of the Sb2Se3 film increased and became larger than that based on the pure CdS film. The trend for the detailed grain size distribution of the Sb2Se3 films based on the three buffer layers is shown in Fig. S13d–f (ESI,† the images have been processed using the MIPAR software24). It can be clearly seen that the grain size of the Sb2Se3 films based on the CdS/SnO2 buffer layers is larger than the others. The small grains result in a lower grain boundary density and reduce the probability of electron capture. On the other hand, compared with the Sb2Se3 film based on the CdS/SnO2 and CdS buffer layer, some pinholes can be seen and some of the secondary phase can be found on the surface of the Sb2Se3 films based on the CdS film. This will result in an interface recombination and leakage of the CdS/Sb2Se3 solar cells (Fig. S14, ESI†). This may be another reason for the high efficiency of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the CdS/SnO2 film.25 In addition, the grain sizes were also calculated using the Debye–Scherrer equation based on the XRD data (Fig. S15, ESI†). The result shows that the grain size of the Sb2Se3 film based on the CdS/SnO2 film is higher than that based on the CdS film, which is consistent with the SEM results. Fig. S16 (ESI†) shows the AFM images of the Sb2Se3 films based on the three buffer layers. It can be seen that the bright protuberance on the surface of the Sb2Se3 films based on the CdS/SnO2 layer is lower than the others, which indicates that the Sb2Se3 film based on the CdS/SnO2 film has a better nucleation than the others.
4. Conclusions
In summary, an ultrathin CdS layer fabricated using the CBD method was introduced at the interface between the FTO and the SnO2 film. It was found that the added ultrathin CdS film not only increased the carrier transport and connection, but also decreased the conduction band offset and the grain boundary density. Different thicknesses of the CdS film were used as the interface layer and when the thickness of the CdS film was 10 nm, the device obtained the highest efficiency. Finally, a 5.27% efficiency for the solar cell with a novel FTO/CdS (10 nm)/SnO2(40 nm)/Sb2Se3/Au structure has been obtained. This is the highest reported efficiency for the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the SnO2 buffer layer. We believe that the efficiency of this solar cell can be further improved by increasing the carrier concentration and carrier lifetime, and decreasing the interface defects. We also think that this buffer layer could have potential applications in preparing low-cost and high-efficiency solar cells.
