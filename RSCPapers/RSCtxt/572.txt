    , Accepted 17th December 2014First published on 22nd January 2015AbstractA visible light responsive nanoporous sulfur doped TiO2 nanophotocatalyst was prepared by a greener approach using ultrasonic irradiation. The synthesized product was characterized by physicochemical techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy. The elemental composition, morphology and surface area were determined by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDXS), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis, respectively. The results confirmed the formation of a nanoporous S-doped TiO2 photocatalyst having the anatase phase and exhibiting a particle size of about 8–24 nm. The influence of sulfur doping on the phase transition, band gap and crystalline size of the TiO2 was investigated by varying the molar ratio of titanium and sulfur. Sulfur doping leads to the lowering of the band gap of TiO2 from 3.25 eV to 2.47 eV and also delays the phase transition of TiO2 from the anatase to rutile form. The response of the synthesized catalysts towards the photo-induced degradation of an organic pollutant was investigated in different regions (490 nm, 565 nm and 660 nm) of the solar spectrum using 2-chlorophenol as a model compound. Maximum photocatalytic degradation efficiency was found with S-550 at pH 6 under visible light of 660 nm. The synthesized S-doped TiO2 photocatalyst showed profound improvement in photocatalytic activity under solar light as compared to TiO2 Degussa and TiO2 Merck.
1. Introduction
The remediation of organic pollutants from the environmental matrix has emerged as an issue of great concern for the sustainable development of modern civilization. Water, being the basic primary requirement for any activity, needs to be protected in pure form and to be preserved for the future generations. This has led to a flurry of research activities in the area of waste water treatment technologies, which can phase out pollutants from the environment. The literature study reflects that semiconductor based photocatalysis may be employed as a potential destructive technology for the degradation of contaminants from the environmental matrix.1 Investigations are mainly focused on semiconductor TiO2, being a preferred photocatalyst because of its physiochemical properties such as non-toxicity, low cost, strong oxidizing power, and biological and chemical inertness.2,3
In spite of the availability of sufficient scientific findings and supported data in the field of heterogeneous photocatalysis, the transfer of this valuable technology to industries requires solutions to certain practical limitations. Semiconductor photocatalysis can pave the way to solve this issue. One of the major challenges is to make the process cost effective by developing photocatalysts which will be able to respond to the natural light. However, the existing widely used photocatalyst TiO2 absorbs mainly the UV light because of its larger band gap (3.25 eV).4 Therefore, the impetus of the current research is on the modification of TiO2 to make it visible light responsive, i.e. shifting the absorption wavelength from UV to the solar region. The various possibilities explored for the modification of TiO2 to make it a visible light responsive photocatalyst include semiconductor coupling, surface modification, band gap modification by creating oxygen vacancies and doping of metals and non-metals.5–8 Doping of semiconductors in controlled amounts is done for the purpose of narrowing the band gap.
Mills and Hoffmann9 demonstrated that doping of a catalyst with a suitable material (non-metal and metals) can enhance its photocatalytic performance in the visible region. Mohamed et al.10 discussed the possibility of doping of p-block elements (C, N, F, P or S) in the anatase phase of TiO2. Sulfur doped TiO2 was synthesized by researchers using the hydrothermal method or the sol–gel method.11–16 Hussain et al.17 reported the size-controlled synthesis of sulfur doped TiO2 (anatase) nanoparticles by the reaction of titanium tetrachloride, water and sulfuric acid with the addition of NaOH at room temperature. The photo-catalytic properties of synthesized photocatalysts were studied for the conversion of CO2 and H2O and the degradation of phenol. Han et al.18 reported the synthesis of innovative, visible light activated sulfur doped TiO2 films by the sol–gel method. These films were effectively used for the degradation of hepatotoxin microcystin–LR under visible light. Szatmary et al.19 prepared sulfur doped TiO2 nanoparticles by a reaction of titanium butoxide and thiourea in methanol. Yang et al.20 reported low temperature solvothermal synthesis of visible light responsive S-doped TiO2 nanocrystals using thiourea as the sulfur source to enhance sulfur incorporation into the TiO2 lattice and used for the degradation of methylene blue and phenol molecules. Ma et al.21 reported the fabrication and photo-catalytic properties of cationic and anionic S-doped TiO2 nanofibers by the electrospinning technique for the degradation of rhodamine B. Xiang et al.22,23 reported the synthesis of nitrogen self-doped TiO2 and N–S-co-doped TiO2 nanomaterials using the solvothermal method and the hydrothermal method, respectively. Zhou et al.24 applied the density functional theory (DFT) calculation to understand the response of N–S co-doped anatase TiO2.
The method to synthesise a catalyst plays a dominant role in determining structural, physical and optical properties of the catalysts. Ultrasound radiations assisted synthesis results in the formation of metal oxide nanoparticles with a controlled morphology and desired properties in lesser time. No study has been reported in the literature for the green synthesis of S-doped TiO2 to improve the band gap and photo-catalytic activity. The present study is an attempt to synthesize nanoporous S-doped TiO2 by using an inorganic template ethanedithiol (bidentate ligand) under ultrasonic irradiation. The synthesized catalysts are characterized and their photo-catalytic activity for the degradation of an organic compound (2-chlorophenol) is also investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemicals
Titanium isopropoxide (98%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ethanedithiol used as a sulfur precursor was also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ethanol used was of analytical grade. 2-Chlorophenol was purchased from S.D. Fine-Chem. Limited.
2.2 Synthesis and characterization of S-doped TiO2
Titanium isopropoxide and ethanedithiol in a molar ratio (1:1, 1:0.1 and 1:0.5) was dissolved in 20 ml of ethanol with constant stirring respectively. The resultant solution was further stirred for half an hour followed by the addition of NH4OH solution. Thereafter the resultant mixture was put under an ultrasonic bath and was exposed to sound waves of 40 kHz for 40 min and kept overnight. The obtained precipitates were filtered by vacuum filtration, crystallized and dried in oven at 100 °C for 2 hours. The yellow colored precipitates obtained were calcinated at different temperatures (350°, 450°, 550° and 750 °C). The S-doped TiO2 photocatalyst was characterized for elemental composition, morphology, crystallinity and optical properties.
The phase and structure identification of the as-synthesized sulfur-doped TiO2 was carried out by the X-ray diffraction technique. An X-ray diffractometer (XPERT-PRO) employing Cu Kα radiation (=0.15406 nm) having a scanning rate of 5° min−1 in the 2θ angle ranged from 20° to 80°. The IR spectrum was recorded on a Fourier Transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer (Spectrum One, Perkin Elmer). The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples were recorded using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu). The morphology and size of TiO2 nanoparticles were measured using a high resolution transmission electron microscope (TECNAI 200 kV TEM) Fei, electron optics and a scanning electron microscope (JSM-6610-JEOL/EO) at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The Raman spectrum was recorded using a Model-iHR Spectrograph (Make-JY-HORIBA). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area was determined by the N2 adsorption method using a smartsorb 91/92 instrument after preheating 100 mg samples at 150 °C for 1 hour. The samples were regenerated at 175 °C for 90 min.
2.3 Experimental setup and the procedure for photocatalytic degradation
The photocatalytic activity of the synthesized S-doped TiO2 was assessed by performing experiments in specially designed double walled reaction vessels (volume 250 ml) in the photo-catalytic chamber. The chamber was equipped with LED bulbs having different wavelengths. The photocatalytic activity of as synthesized S-doped TiO2 has been investigated by the irradiation of 50 ml suspension of 2-chlorophenol and S-550 (50 mg) under visible light. The solution was constantly stirred by using magnetic stirrers. The aeration was ensured by using aerators. At different time intervals, an aliquot was taken out with the help of a syringe and then filtered through a Millipore syringe filter of 0.22 μm. The rate of degradation of 2-chlorophenol was determined spectrophotometrically, by monitoring the changes in absorption spectra recorded at 273 nm. The degradation efficiency (%) has been calculated as follows: Efficiency (%) = (C0 − C)/C0 × 100(1)
3. Result and discussion
A uniformly distributed nanosized S-doped TiO2 photocatalyst was obtained by the ultrasound method. Sound wave imposition on solution results in the production of acoustic cavitations, which leads to localized hot spots having high temperature (about 5000 °C) and high pressure (1000 atm).25 The inter-particle collisions result in the formation of uniformly distributed nanomaterials, which may lead to higher catalytic activity.
3.1 XRD analysis
The XRD-analysis of synthesized S-doped TiO2 calcinated at 550 °C (S-550) was performed to investigate the crystal structure. The XRD patterns of the samples calcinated at 550 °C (S-550) show strong diffraction peaks at 25.4°, 37.05°, 38.6°, 48.15°, 53.92° and 75.28° and are depicted in Fig. 1. The observed patterns were matched with JCPDS card number 01-073-1764. The values of lattice parameters (a, b, c, α, β and γ), lattice strain and cell volume of S-550 are given in Table 1. The results confirmed anatase as the main phase and the tetrahedral crystal system for S-550. The smallest average crystallite size of 14–72 nm was thus determined for the S-doped TiO2 catalyst using the Scherer equation for the most intense peak (101), the diffraction peak of anatase.8 The XRD of the calcinated synthesized S-doped TiO2 catalyst at various temperatures, 350 °C, 450 °C, 550 °C, shows the same crystalline structure and phase. However, at 750 °C the phase transformation occurs and peaks for both the anatase and rutile phases were observed. The sample shows peaks at 25.4°, 37.05°, 38.6°, 48.15°, 53.92° and 27.49°, 36.1°, 39.22°, 41.26°, 44.07°, 53.87°, 56.70°, 62.63°, 69.08°, 72.61°, 76.61° respectively for anatase and rutile at 750 °C. The observed patterns were matched with JCPDS card number 01-073-1764 and 01-089-4920.

In order to study the influence of sulfur doping on the transformation of the anatase to rutile phase, experiments were carried out using S-doped TiO2 calcinated at 750 °C. Table 2 gives X-ray diffraction data of S-doped TiO2 calcinated at 750 °C prepared by varying the molar ratio of TiO2 and ethanedithiol (1:1, 1:0.1 and 1:0.5). The percentages of phase transformation from the anatase to rutile phase obtained are 11.9:88.1%, 58.2:41.8% and 89.5:10.5%, when the molar ratio of TiO2:dopant varies from 1:0.1, 1:0.5 and 1:1, respectively. The sulfur atoms of the precursor ethanedithiol (bidentate ligand) bind strongly to the TiO2 lattice and causes delay in the transformation of the anatase to rutile form. The stability of the anatase phase is evident from its percentage (89.5%) even at 750 °C.

3.2 Morphological studies and elemental composition
The surface morphology and elemental composition of the synthesized S-doped TiO2 nanoparticles calcinated at 550 °C (S-550) have been investigated by SEM and EDX (Fig. 2a and b). The micrograph shows the formation of global and uniform nanoporous particles having 0.10 weight% of sulfur doped into the TiO2 lattice. The presence of peaks at around 2.1 and 2.3 keV clearly confirms the presence of sulfur. Fig. 3 and 4 depicts the effect of calcination temperature (i.e. at 350 °C, 450 °C, 550 °C and 750 °C) and the dopant concentration on the surface morphology of the synthesized photocatalyst. Both parameters (calcination temperature and dopant concentration) resulted in the improvement of porosity of the sample (S-550).

The TEM observation of S-550 (Fig. 5) confirms the formation of a nano-range (8–24 nm) photocatalyst, and the observed pattern shows that the nanoporous particle has a particle size of 17 nm. The surface area of S-550 was investigated by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) studies and was found to be 61.822 m2 g−1.

3.3 Spectroscopic studies
The FTIR spectrum of the S-550 sample (Fig. 6a) showed a strong absorption band at 2500–3700 cm−1 and a narrow band at 1627.58 cm−1 assigned to the hydroxyl group stretching and bending vibrations. The IR peaks observed at 1400.63 cm−1, 1142.61 cm−1 and 1051.62 cm−1 were assigned to the SO stretching mode, S–O stretching vibration and Ti–S stretching vibration, respectively. A broad, intense peak was observed at 400–900 cm−1 corresponding to the vibration mode of the anatase skeletal Ti–O–Ti bond. This is in confirmation with the previous results shown by researchers.11,18

The Raman spectrum (Fig. 6b) supports the formation of anatase as a predominant phase. The main peak at 143 cm−1 was flanked by small peaks at 197, 397, 512, 637 cm−1. The results are in agreement with previously reported studies.10
The UV-Vis spectrum of S-550 (Fig. 6c) shows the main absorption band in the UV region (300–400 nm) and improved absorption in the visible region (500–700 nm) as compared to Degussa P25. The band gap energy of the S-doped TiO2 sample was calculated by using an equation: E(eV) = hc/λ = 1239.95/λ(3)where E is the band gap energy (eV), h is Planck's constant, c is the velocity of light (m s−1) and λ is the wavelength in nm. The as synthesized S-doped TiO2 shows a band gap of 2.47 eV as compared to the band gap of 3.25 eV of Degussa P25, which may result in a better activity of S-550 in the visible spectrum.
3.4 Photo-degradation of 2-chlorophenol using S-550
The response of S-550 towards the visible light induced photo-degradation of 2-chlorophenol was investigated in various wavelength regions of the solar spectrum. The measured amount of 2-chlorophenol loaded with S-550 was irradiated to light corresponding to the different wavelengths (490 nm, 565 nm, and 660 nm), and the degradation efficiency of S-550 was investigated. Fig. 7 shows the percentage degradation of 2-chlorophenol at different wavelengths. The degradation efficiency of S-550 at different wavelengths, 660, 565, 490 nm, was found to be 86.7, 71.5, and 71.4%, respectively. As the maximum degradation was observed at 660 nm this region was selected for further investigations.

Fig. 8 depicts the time dependant absorption spectrum for the degradation of 2-chlorophenol using S-550 at 660 nm. The intensity of the absorption peak at 273 nm was diminished gradually under irradiation, and 86.7% degradation of 2-chlorophenol was obtained within 180 min. The degradation process is initiated by the photoexcitation of the catalyst. The photocatalyst on exposure to light energy equal to or greater than its band gap energy results in the formation of a photo-generated electron–hole pair. Furthermore, these entities can migrate to the catalytic surface, where they can enter into a redox reaction via the formation of ˙OH radicals. The formation of ˙OH is also confirmed by the photoluminescence technique by Xiang et al.22 Priti et al.26 identified the formation of a hydroxylated dye as an initial step for the degradation of AO7. The comparative study of the photo-catalytic activity of S-550, TiO2 Merck and Degussa P25 was also carried with the aqueous solution of 2-chlorophenol. The results show weak photo-degradation of 2-chlorophenol about 37.7% on Degussa P25 and 50.1% on TiO2 Merck, whereas for S-550 86.7% of the 2-chlorophenol was degraded (Fig. 9). The promising degradation efficiency (86.7%) observed with S-550 is due to higher absorption in the visible region, which results in better performance of S-550 as a photocatalyst in the wavelength range of 660 nm. The degradation of 2-chlorophenol with TiO2 Merck and Degussa P25 under visible light irradiation may be due to the generation of photo-excited electrons and holes from the rutile side of the band bending region which moves the barrier potential in the opposite direction i.e. towards the anatase conduction band and makes it visible light active.27 The biphasic property of the catalyst plays a major role in the formation rate of ˙OH because it reduces the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes and enhance the ˙OH index.24,28 The other possible reason cited by Xiang et al. is the formation of substrate–surface complex.23

The parameter which plays a dominant role in the photocatalytic degradation of the organic pollutant is pH. Therefore, experiments were carried out to optimize pH by varying pH from 2 to 10. The maximum degradation was obtained at pH 6 for the constant pollutant (2-CP) concentration (25 mg L−1) and catalyst loading (50 mg) (Fig. 10). The results confirm that at pH 6 maximum degradation was obtained (86.7%), followed by 63.1%, 75.9%, 60.6% and 69.6% at 10, 8, 4 and 2, respectively.

4. Conclusion
The present investigation reports the greener synthesis of nanoporous S-doped TiO2 calcinated at 550 °C (S-550) using ultrasonic irradiation. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy results established the formation of a nanoporous structure having the particle size of approximately 8–24 nm. The synthesized S-doped TiO2 photocatalyst (S-550) calcinated at 550 °C has the anatase phase with improved absorption in the visible light region. The maximum degradation (86.7%) of 2-chlorophenol was observed in the visible region at a wavelength of 660 nm after a time interval of 180 min at pH 6. The investigation on the photocatalytic activity of the S-doped TiO2 nanoparticle shows promising results as compared to Degussa P25 and TiO2 Merck. The findings support that the ultrasound assisted synthesis of the nanophotocatalyst can be employed as a greener technique for the production of nanomaterials with a diverse structural morphology having improved photo-catalytic properties.
