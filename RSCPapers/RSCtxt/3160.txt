    , Accepted 30th December 2019First published on 31st December 2019Abstract2D/3D mixed perovskites have been recognized as very promising materials for simultaneously achieving high efficiency and stability in solar cells. In this work, we developed a seed-mediated and solvent-assisted Ostwald ripening method to form 2D PEA2PbI4 with a gradient distribution in the underlying 3D perovskite layer by a two-step deposition process with DMF as an additive. Using this method, the reaction of PEAI with MAPbI3 seed grains is prone to produce pure PEA2PbI4 which gives a graduated cladding on the 3D perovskite grains rather than a traditional 2D/3D planar heterostructured perovskite. We demonstrate that this type of perovskite simultaneously delivers a better optical performance and a higher stability than traditional perovskites. The devices made by our method exhibit an average enhancement of 15.5% in power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared with the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) made with 2D/3D planar heterojunction perovskites. Besides, the PCE of the proposed cell without encapsulation remains at above 88% of its original value after 15 days of storage in an air environment at 35–55% humidity, which is higher than the 83% delivered by the 2D/3D planar heterojunction PSCs. Moreover, this kind of cell shows superior operational stability at maximum power under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 over 1 h relative to the regular 3D PSCs. Our results demonstrate an important strategy for the preparation of highly efficient and stable PSCs for future photovoltaic applications.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites are regarded as promising solar cell materials due to their excellent optoelectronic properties and low-cost preparation. Since their first application in photovoltaics in 2009, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has soared from 3.8% to 25.2%, indicating that PSCs have tremendous potential for future photovoltaic applications.1–8
Despite the significant improvements in PCE, the sustained operational stability of PSCs remains a large barrier to their further development and application. The organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials tend to degrade rapidly in humid, high temperature and light environments, resulting in a long-term stability that is far behind that of silicon solar cells. In order to overcome this problem, complex and expensive packaging technologies have often been used, but these still cannot fundamentally solve the problem of perovskite stability.9–13 Recently, it was found that layered two-dimensional (2D) perovskites, which have long-chain organic cations with strongly hydrophobic groups as the terminal layer (such as phenethylammonium (PEA) and butylammonium (BA)14–17), show much better stability than 3D perovskites. However, the PSCs with a 2D perovskite layer as a light absorber often have poor PCEs due to their large energy band gaps, strong exciton binding energies, low charge carrier mobilities and short diffusion lengths.14–17 Hainhan Tsai et al.18 attempted to overcome this issue by producing layered perovskite (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 thin films with near-single-crystalline quality, wherein the crystallographic planes of the inorganic perovskite component had a strongly preferential out of plane alignment in relation to the contacts in planar solar cells. Thus efficient charge transport was facilitated and the PCE of 12.52% was obtained. Wang et al.19 developed a p–i–n bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSC by the incorporation of a p/n-type polymer into quasi-2D perovskites to obtain the PCE of 12.1%, which was attributed to improved exciton dissociation in low-dimensional layers. However, these methods needed strict and precise control of processes such as temperature or doping concentration. In addition, the efficiency of these 2D layered perovskites was still much lower than that of their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts. Chen et al.20 reported an effective and reproducible approach for enhancing the stability of and suppressing the hysteresis in PSCs by incorporating a small quantity of 2D PEA2PbI4 into the grain boundary of 3D MAPbI3, and thus a comparable PCE to that of a 3D MAPbI3-based cell was achieved. However, the films obtained by spin-coating 2D–3D mixed precursor solutions always have poor morphology because the long chain cations have substantially larger sizes than the commonly employed MA cations. In contrast, it is more controllable and reproducible to fabricate 2D/3D heterojunction perovskite films for achieving high efficiency and good ambient stability simultaneously. The 2D/3D heterojunction perovskite films are often obtained by post-treating 3D perovskite films to coat them with a solution of long chain organic molecules, such as PEAI.21,22 However, using this method, the organic halide salt PEAI, rather than the 2D layered PEA2PbI4 perovskite is often formed on the top of 3D perovskite.23
Here, we developed a seed-mediated and solvent-assisted Ostwald ripening method to form 2D PEA2PbI4 with a gradient distribution in an underlying 3D perovskite layer using a two-step deposition processes with DMF as an additive. In contrast to previously reported methods, the reaction of PEAI with MAPbI3 seed grains is prone to produce pure PEA2PbI4 and gives a graduated cladding on the 3D perovskite grains. This type of 2D/3D mixed perovskite has better stability and optical performance than those of regular perovskites with 2D/3D planar heterojunctions. As a result, more stable inverted PSCs were achieved with a PCE enhancement of 15.5% on average compared with that of a PSC with a 2D/3D planar heterojunction due to the significant improvement in short-circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF). After 15 days of storage in an air environment at 35–55% humidity, the PCE of the proposed cell without encapsulation remained at above 88% of its original value, which is higher than the 83% delivered by the 2D/3D planar heterojunction PSC under the same conditions. Moreover, this kind of cell shows good operational stability at maximum output power under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 over 1000 h relative to the regular 3D PSCs.
Results and discussion
Perovskite films with 2D/3D gradient mixed perovskite interface layers were prepared by two-step deposition, as shown in Fig. 1. First, 3D MAPbI3 perovskite seed grains were obtained utilizing an excess of polar sec-butyl alcohol as an anti-solvent to limit the crystallization of the perovskites.24–26 Then the seed films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 s to remove the residual solvent. Subsequently, PEAI dissolved in isopropanol with a DMF additive was spin-coated on the as-prepared 3D perovskite seed grains and then annealed at 100 °C for 20 min. More experimental details can be seen in the Experimental section.

As reflected in Fig. 2a, the seed film consists of small crystal grains with sizes of about 100–400 nm, which is completely different from that of a 3D MAPbI3 film prepared by a traditional method which has a large crystal grain distribution and vertical grain boundaries24,25 (see Fig. 2b). After post-treatment involving PEAI solution-induced Ostwald ripening, perovskite films with large grain distributions are obtained (see Fig. 2c). It is clear that a distinct capping layer is formed on the top of the 3D MAPbI3 perovskite film through layer by layer deposition in the absence of DMF in the PEAI solution, which suggests a 2D/3D planar heterojunction structure. When a small amount of DMF is used as an additive, the capping layer disappears gradually. The capping layer disappears completely when DMF is added at a 1% volume ratio. It can be deduced that the 3D seed film has been converted into a 2D/3D gradient mixed perovskite layer. Compared with the 1% DMF film, some small pits appear on the surface of the films when the concentration of DMF is increased to 1.5%, resulting in a rough surface. This could originate from the erosion of the perovskite film by too much DMF due to its strong polarity (see Fig. 2c). All of these results indicate that the DMF additive plays a significant role in the Ostwald ripening process.

In order to understand the role of DMF in the Ostwald ripening process and confirm the composition and structure of the PEAI post-treated perovskite films, we conducted further experimental characterization. It is found from Fig. 3a that the absorption band edges of the perovskite films after Ostwald ripening with and without the DMF additive are both blue-shifted compared with that of a regular 3D film. Considering the wide band gap of 2D perovskite, it was suggested that the 2D perovskite could form after Ostwald ripening irrespective of the use of a DMF additive. However, no new diffraction peaks are observed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the PEAI post-treated films with the DMF additive compared with that of 3D perovskite. It is likely that a small amount of 2D perovskite is mixed into the 3D perovskite and hence it is hard to detect by XRD.20,27,28 Furthermore, the fact that there are no shifts in the main diffraction peaks shows that the long chain organic cations are not arranged in the crystal lattice of the 3D perovskite and rather form 2D perovskite at 3D grain boundaries. When we observe the XRD of PEAI post-treated film without the DMF additive, a new peak at 4.2° can be seen, and besides, there seem to be some weak peaks at 12.5° to 17.5°. In order to observe these more clearly, we used higher concentrations of PEAI for Ostwald ripening and then analyzed the corresponding XRD patterns. As the concentration of PEAI increased, we noticed some new peaks appear at 7.5°, 12.5°,16.5° and 27.5° in the XRD pattern of the film without the DMF additive, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). These peaks can be indexed to 2D perovskite, PEAI and PbI2.14,27,29 However, the XRD pattern of the film prepared in the presence of DMF remains unchanged. These results indicate that PEAI does not completely react with MAPbI3 in the absence of DMF, and thus forms a capping layer of 2D perovskite that includes some PEAI and PbI2 on the top of the 3D perovskite, as reflected in eqn (1). Once some DMF is added into the PEAI solution, MAPbI3 converts into an amorphous phase of MAI–DMF–PbI2. PbI2, MAI and PEAI have high solubility in such an amorphous phase so they can diffuse a longer distance in this environment. Therefore, DMF promotes not only the growth of perovskite grains but also the conversion of 3D MAPbI3 to 2D (PEA)2PbI4 by eqn (2), wherein 2D (PEA)2PbI4 can distribute in the crystal boundary rather than in the crystal lattice of 3D perovskite. By the abovementioned characterization and analysis, the possible structure and composition of PEAI-treated films with and without DMF are proposed, as shown in Fig. 4. PEAI-treated film without DMF has a 2D/3D heterojunction structure with a 2D perovskite capping layer including a small amount PEAI and PbI2. In contrast, PEAI-treated film with the DMF additive is composed of 2D perovskite coating 3D perovskite grains with a gradient distribution on the top of the 3D perovskite. (1) (2)

In order to confirm the distribution of 2D (PEA)2PbI4 inside the perovskite film, Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) measurements were carried out for two kinds of 2D/3D perovskite films. The ToF-SIMS depth profiles of PEA+ and MA+ are shown in Fig. 5. For the 2D/3D planar heterojunction, one can find that the intensity of PEA+ ions is very high at the near-surface of the film and then decreases steeply towards a very low level with the increase of sputter time to 19 s, meaning that there is a high accumulation of PEA+ ion on the top of the 3D perovskite film. In contrast, for the perovskite film made by our proposed method, the intensity of the PEA+ ions decreases gently to a very low level as the sputter time is increased to 70 s, indicating that PEA+ has diffused into the 3D perovskite film with a gradient distribution, which proves the hypothesis proposed in Fig. 4.

Fig. 6 displays the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of different perovskite films and the corresponding contact potential difference (CPD) images obtained by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). From Fig. 6a, it is found that the 2D/3D gradient film has a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.89, which is higher than that of the regular 3D film and lower than that of the 2D/3D planar heterojunction film. This means that Ostwald ripening with a small amount of DMF is favorable for smoothening the surface of the perovskite film. Compared with the regular 3D film, the surface potentials of the 2D/3D gradient film and the 2D/3D planar heterojunction film become more uniform (see Fig. 6b), which may be due to the partial elimination of sub-gap defect states by 2D perovskite.30,31 The mean surface potential of the 2D/3D gradient film is 145 mV, being higher than that of the regular 3D perovskite film (115 mV) and lower than that of the 2D/3D planar heterojunction film (178 mV); the corresponding surface work functions were then calculated according to the method described in the literature.32 The calculated results indicate that the work function reduces successively from 4.535 eV to 4.505 eV and 4.472 eV in the order regular 3D film >2D/3D gradient film >2D/3D planar heterojunction film; that is, the Fermi energy level is up-shifted successively (see Fig. 6b), which is consistent with the reports in the literature.33 The work function of the 2D/3D gradient film is higher than that of the 2D/3D planar heterojunction film, which is probably because PEA2PbI4 favors gradient growth in boundaries of 3D perovskite in the presence of DMF rather than deposition only on the top of the 3D perovskite.

Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were done to investigate further the carrier dynamics for the different perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 7. One can see clearly from Fig. 7a that the steady state PL peaks are located at 764 nm for the 2D/3D gradient film and at 766 nm for the 2D/3D planar heterojunction film, with blue-shifts of 6–8 nm relative to the peak of the regular 3D perovskite film. This could result from the presence of a small amount of 2D PEA2PbI4 which has a wider band gap of 2.36 eV compared to that of MAPbI3 (1.55 eV), consistent with the blue-shifting of the abovementioned absorption band edge. Besides, the PL intensity of the 2D/3D gradient mixed film is the highest among all films, which could originate from the defect passivation effect of 2D PEA2PbI4 on MAPbI3 reducing the numbers of recombination centers and thus suppressing nonradioactive recombination. From the time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay curves displayed in Fig. 7b, one can find that the average lifetimes of the 2D/3D gradient mixture film and 2D/3D planar heterojunction perovskite are prolonged to 275 ns and 230 ns, respectively, much longer than that of regular 3D perovskite (123 ns). Such a large increase in carrier lifetimes also indicates the reduced nonradioactive recombination by the passivation effect of PEA2PbI4 or PEAI;33–35 this result is consistent with the abovementioned uniform surface potential for the PEAI-treated films. Compared with the 2D/3D planar heterojunction film, the PL intensity and carrier lifetime of the 2D/3D gradient film are both increased. This means that the Ostwald ripening process with DMF as an additive promotes the formation of a higher quality perovskite, and hence leads to fewer trap states. It is worth noting that when we tested the TRPL decay from the bottom of the perovskite films (see Fig. S2, ESI†), the 2D/3D gradient film and 2D/3D planar heterojunction film showed carrier lifetimes of about 142 ns and 135 ns, respectively. Such large differences of the PL lifetime with top/bottom-side photoexcitation suggest that the 3D MAPbI2 exists at the bottom of PEAI-treated films, while 2D PEA2PbI4 is located on the top of 3D MAPbI2, coating the 3D perovskite grains with a gradient distribution instead of being uniformly incorporated into the 3D MAPbI2, in agreement with the SIMS results (see Fig. 5). We also tested the TRPLs of the 2D/3D gradient mixture and 2D/3D planar heterojunction perovskite films with PCBM as an electron extraction layer, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The 2D/3D planar heterojunction film with PCBM shows the carrier lifetime of about 21.5 ns, which is longer than that of the 2D/3D gradient mixture film with PCBM (10.1 ns). These results indicate that the accumulation of PEAI or 2D perovskite on the top of the 3D perovskite film is disadvantageous for electron transfer while the 2D/3D gradient mixed perovskite is better for electron extraction from perovskite to PCBM due to the fact that its energy level is better matched to that of PCBM.

Furthermore, the performances of different kinds of PSCs were investigated, as summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 8 (data were obtained on the basis of 20 devices of each kind). The 3D seed grain cells show a terrible performance with an average PCE of only 11.28%, which is lower than that of the regular 3D MAPbI3 device (15.61%), due to the poor crystallization of the seed grains. The performances of PSCs are improved obviously after post-treatment by PEAI/isopropanol solution with the DMF additive. On the one hand, this can be attributed to the more efficient Ostwald ripening, wherein DMF facilitates the recrystallization of small-size crystals into large perovskite grains and thus reduces pinhole formation. On the other hand, DMF as an additive promotes the growth of 2D PEA2PbI4 and induces the 2D PEA2PbI4 gradient mixture in the grain boundary of 3D MAPbI3. In order to confirm the role of the DMF additive in Ostwald ripening, the performances of PSCs made with different concentrations of DMF are compared in detail, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). One can see that when 1% DMF is used, the optimal device is achieved with the best PCE of 16.64%, which is obviously higher than the PCE of the 2D/3D planar heterojunction device made without the DMF additive (13.72%). However, the utilization of too much DMF leads to poor device performance due to the poor surface morphology of the resulting perovskite film (see Fig. 2). In addition, it is observed from Table 1 that both the 2D/3D gradient mixture and 2D/3D planar heterojunction cells show higher open-circuit voltages (Voc) of 1.02 V and 1.04 V, respectively, compared to that of the regular 3D perovskite device; this is mainly due to the existence of 2D PEA2PbI4 resulting in the up-shift of the Fermi energy level and the increase of Vbuilt-in, as reflected in Fig. 6c. However, the Jsc (16.88 mA cm−2) and FF (0.763) of the 2D/3D planar heterojunction cell are obviously lower than those of regular 3D perovskite cells due to the low carrier transport and mismatching energy level of the 2D perovskite capping layer. Moreover, the residual PEAI and PbI2 in the capping layer may bring new trap states, as reflected in the abovementioned PL spectra. In contrast, for the 2D/3D gradient device with 1% DMF as the additive, Jsc and FF are increased to 19.53 mA cm−2 (further verified by external quantum efficiency (EQE), see Fig. 8b) and 0.802, respectively, being very close to or higher than those of the regular 3D perovskite cell. These results indicate that the 2D/3D gradient mixture film has similar carrier transport and extraction performance to those of the regular 3D perovskite film. In turn, this may provide indirect evidence for the existence of 2D perovskite in the grain boundary of 3D perovskite. In short, the seed-mediated and DMF-assisted Ostwald ripening is a very efficient method for achieving high Voc, Jsc and FF simultaneously (the PCE histogram of the 2D/3D gradient mixture, 2D/3D planar heterojunction, and regular 3D PSCs can be seen in Fig. S4, ESI†). The performances of the 2D/3D gradient mixture and 2D/3D planar heterojunction cells with different PEAI concentrations were measured, as reflected in Fig. S5 and Tables S2, S3 (ESI†). One can find that a high PEAI concentration has a negative influence on the cell performance because an excess of PEAI is not beneficial for carrier transport. We also tested the hysteresis in cells with different perovskite layers at a scan rate of 0.08 V s−1 (see Fig. 8c). The 2D/3D gradient device shows the least hysteresis among all the devices. It is reported that the hysteresis is related to the modulation of interfacial barriers due to ion migration and charge accumulation formed between the charge generation layer and the charge transfer layer.20,34 The reduction of the hysteresis in the 2D/3D gradient devices is an indicator of the suppression of ion migration due to the presence of 2D perovskite at grain boundaries.20 However, the hysteresis is significantly increased in 2D/3D planar heterojunction devices. This can be attributed to the accumulation of PEA+ on the top of the perovskite film which increases the interface resistance due to the enhanced insulating property, leading to charge accumulation between the perovskite layer and the electron transport layer (ETL), hence resulting in the lower FF in the forward scan.34

Furthermore, it is found that our proposed method is suitable for other 2D organic halide salts, as shown in Fig. 9 (the data were obtained on the basis of 20 devices of each kind). When DMF is added into BAI/isopropanol or PAI/isopropanol solution, it has the same effect as in PEAI/isopropanol solution (more details can be seen in Tables S4 and S5, ESI†). This means that this method has good universality and prospects for application.

Next, the stability of each kind of cell was investigated. From Fig. 10a we can see that the regular 3D cell shows fast degradation after exposure to an ambient environment with humidity of 45 ± 10% for 15 days. The moisture stability of the PSCs is significantly improved when 2D perovskite exists on the top of or located at the 3D perovskite grain boundary due to the hydrophobicity of PEA2PbI4. The PCE of the 2D/3D gradient cell remains at above 88% of the original value after 15 days, which is slightly higher than the 83% retained by the 2D/3D planar heterojunction cell in the same conditions. Besides, steady-state output measurements were carried out at maximum power for the different cells under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and 50% relative humidity (RH) over 1 h (see Fig. 10b). It is found that all cells show a fast response after the light is switched on. Both the 2D/3D gradient and 2D/3D planar heterojunction devices exhibit excellent stability at maximum power, while the 3D device shows an obvious decay in current density from 19.16 mA cm−2 to 17.50 mA cm−2 during the steady-state operation process. This result is consistent with the moisture stability test. This could be due to the hydrophobic benzene groups in PEA+ which prevent the invasion of H2O from surfaces and grain boundaries in high humidity environments. The results are further confirmed by the SEM images of perovskite films stored in an ambient environment with humidity of 45 ± 10% for 10 days (see Fig. 10c). One can see from Fig. 10c that the regular 3D perovskite film has been seriously degraded and the cracks in the grain boundaries of the 2D/3D planar heterojunction film become larger after 10 days. In contrast, the 2D/3D gradient film shows no change after the same time, despite the higher water contact angle of the 2D/3D planar heterojunction film compared to that of the 2D/3D gradient film. Compared with 2D/3D planar heterojunction and 3D perovskite films, the excellent moisture resistance ability of the 2D/3D gradient film demonstrates that 2D perovskite should be located at 3D perovskite grain boundaries rather than randomly distributed inside 3D perovskite crystal grains.

Conclusion
In summary, highly-efficient and stable 2D/3D gradient mixed PSCs were fabricated by seed-mediated and DMF-assisted Ostwald ripening. It is demonstrated that DMF induces grain growth and promotes PEAI to convert into PEA2PbI4, coating the 3D perovskite grains with a gradient distribution rather than forming a 2D/3D planar heterojunction. This type of perovskite simultaneously delivers a better optical performance and a higher stability than traditional 2D/3D planar heterojunction perovskites. A best PCE of 16.46% is achieved and this is maintained at 88% of its initial value after 15 days in an air environment with humidity of 45 ± 10% under unencapsulated conditions. Moreover, this kind of cell shows excellent operational stability at maximum power under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 over 1 h. Besides, this fabrication method works for other 2D organic halide salts and exhibits good universality. We believe that this work provides a simple and effective method for the fabrication of stable and high-efficiency PSCs.
Experimental section
Fabrication of perovskite layers

3D seed grains. 
The MAPbI3 perovskite precursor solution was formulated by dissolving a mixture of PbI2 (99.99%, Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp.) and MAI (99%, Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp.) in the molar ratio of 1:1.05 in a mixed solvent prepared using DMF (99.5%, Aladdin) and DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide, 99.5%, Aladdin) at the volume ratio of 9:1. Then the precursor solution was spin-coated on a PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrate at 6000 rpm, and after a delay time of 9 s, the rotating wet film was washed by dripping it with 500 μl sec-butyl alcohol (98%, Aladdin). After spinning for 30 s, the film was annealed briefly at 100 °C for 10 s.

Ostwald ripening process
PEAI/IPA solutions (each 20 μl at 2 mg ml−1) with different volume ratios of DMF or in the absence of DMF were spin-coated on seed perovskite films at 4000 rpm. Finally, the films were annealed at 100 °C for 20 min.
Regular 3D film
The MAPbI3 perovskite precursor solution was formulated by a similar method to that used for the 3D seed grain film. Then the precursor solution was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrate at 6000 rpm, and after the delay time of 9 s, the rotating wet film was washed by dripping it with 250 μl sec-butyl alcohol (98%, Aladdin). After spinning for 30 s, the film was annealed at 100 °C in air for 30 min and then annealed in a DMSO atmosphere at 100 °C for 10–15 min.
Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using a JSM-7100F (JEOL). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and contact potential difference (CPD) images were obtained using a Park Systems NX10 equipped with a scanning Kelvin probe microscope. J–V characteristics of all solar cells under AM 1.5G illumination were measured using a programmable SourceMeter (Keithley 2400) and a solar simulator (ABET SUN3000). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using a Rigaku D/Max-B X-Ray diffractometer. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a power source (ZOLIX CSC1011) with a monochromator and a source meter. The steady-state and transient-state PL spectra were measured using a xenon lamp at 467 nm and a nanosecond-pulsed laser at 376.2 nm by fluorescence spectrometry (FLS980, Edinburgh instruments). The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2600 and the static contact angles were measured using instrument XG-CAMA1. The Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was measured using an IONTOF GmbH 5.
