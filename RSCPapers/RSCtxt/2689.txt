E-mail: genevieve.sauve@case.eduReceived 17th July 2013, Accepted 15th August 2013First published on 11th September 2013AbstractA novel strategy for the design and synthesis of functional materials with excellent acceptor properties is presented. The materials are based on homoleptic metal(II) complexes of azadipyrromethene (aza-DIPY) derivatives, and exhibit intense red absorption and high electron affinity. Their strong accepting properties were demonstrated by fluorescence quenching experiments using poly(3-hexylthiophene) as the donor. DFT calculations showed that the homoleptic metal(II) complexes of 2,8-di(4-tert-butylphenylacetylene)-1,3,5,7-tetraphenylazadipyrromethene had a similar distorted tetrahedral geometry to the complexes of 1,3,5,7-tetraphenylazadipyrromethene, but with additional conjugated ‘arms’ extending in 3 dimensions (3D). A unique feature of these complexes is that the two aza-DIPY ligands are π-stacked with each other, with frontier molecular orbitals delocalized over the two ligands. These complexes can therefore easily accept electrons, delocalize the negative charge over a large conjugated structure and have the potential of transporting charges in 3D. These properties make them attractive alternatives to fullerene derivatives for use as acceptors in organic solar cells, photo-detectors and other optoelectronic applications.IntroductionFullerene derivatives have been used as the acceptors of choice for organic photovoltaic applications, due to their high electron affinity, excellent electron accepting properties, and good isotropic electron transport ability.1–5 However, fullerene derivatives have disadvantages, including poor absorption in the visible and near infrared regions, and restricted tuning of energy levels due to poor electronic communication between the fullerene and its substituents.6–10 An ideal acceptor would combine the electronic properties of fullerene derivatives with better light absorption and energy tunability, but finding such an acceptor remains a challenge. Promising alternative acceptors are limited in number, and are usually planar π-conjugated molecules with charge transport in one dimension.11–14 Power conversion efficiencies using non-fullerene acceptors are usually low, less than 4%,15 compared to those higher than 8% using fullerene derivatives.16,17 One reason why fullerene derivatives work so well is that they are spherical, allowing easy charge hopping and transport in many directions. Additionally, once an electron is accepted by fullerene, the electron is delocalized over a large volume, thus facilitating charge separation.18 There is therefore a strong need to develop new fullerene alternatives that also delocalize the charge over a large volume and transport charges in 3D. We are aware of one report where a non-planar star-shaped acceptor using a triphenylamine core was developed with the intention of increasing the charge transport anisotropy.11One overlooked class of candidates for use as acceptors are azadipyrromethene (aza-DIPY) dyes and complexes derived from them. These dyes have high absorption in the red to near-IR region, and tunable properties through substitutions and coordination with BF2 and transition metals.19,20 Both computational studies and cyclic voltammetry analyses suggest that aza-DIPY dyes should be good electron acceptors due to their high electron affinity.21–23 The electron accepting properties of BF2-coordinated aza-DIPY were recently demonstrated in triads, where the aza-DIPY dye is covalently bonded to electron donors such as zinc porphyrin and zinc phthalocyanine.24,25 Although aza-DIPY derivatives have been used as donors in organic photovoltaic cells,26 they have not been reported as acceptors.The main advantage in using aza-DIPY dyes instead of fullerenes as acceptors would be the ability to extend light harvesting to the near-IR, which better complements the absorption spectra of the donor. The most popular and easiest to synthesize aza-DIPY dye, 1,3,5,7-tetraphenylazadipyrromethene (ADP, Fig. 1), has an absorption maximum at 600 nm. A number of strategies have been explored to red-shift the absorption spectra of ADP, including coordination by BF2,27 adding electron rich substituents on the phenyl rings,28–30 restricting the conformation of the aza-DIPY core,31,32 replacing the phenyl rings with thiophene,33 extending the conjugation through the phenyl groups,34,35 making B,O-chelation,36 or making benzannulated derivatives.37 Fig. 1  (a) Structures of 1,3,5,7-tetraphenylazadipyrromethene and its complexes; (b) chemical structure of previously synthesized conjugated oligomers and polymers based on ADP.35,38 In all these cases, while the absorption band is red-shifted, it is narrow, thus limiting the light harvesting ability. Broader absorption bands have been obtained by synthesizing homoleptic complexes of transition metals(II), e.g. ADP2M in Fig. 1a.39–42 Interestingly, the crystal structure of ADP2Zn reported by Gray and coworkers showed interligand π–π stacking with a distance of 3.63 Å between proximal phenyl groups of one ligand and pyrrole groups of the other ligand.39 This inter-ligand π–π stacking explains the absorption band broadening, and would be advantageous in the design of compounds that can delocalize the charge over large volumes. We have also recently demonstrated that greater broadening and red-shifting can be accomplished by incorporating ADP into alternating conjugated oligomers and polymers, as shown in Fig. 1b.35,38These two approaches have their own advantages: the first one leads to 3D conjugated molecules that could have anisotropic charge transport, and the second one leads to materials with very broad absorption extending to the near-IR. Combining these two approaches should provide a solution to creating materials with 3D structures and broad near-IR absorption. However, we found that coordinating aza-DIPY-based polymers with transition metals having 4 accessible coordination sites leads to insoluble materials, since the metals act as cross-linkers.38 We therefore shifted our attention to complexes with aza-DIPY ligands bearing conjugated moieties at the pyrrolic positions to emulate the conjugated polymer properties and enhance broad based absorption qualities. Additionally, the extra conjugated moieties could act as additional ‘conductive arms’ that could further enhance 3D charge transport.Herein, we report the synthesis of 2,6-bis(phenylacetylene)-1,3,5,7-tetraphenylazadipyrromethene (WS1, Scheme 1) and its chelates with BF2 and with four-coordinate transition metals Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II). The optical and electrochemical properties of all new materials have been measured and compared with analogous complexes bearing the ADP ligand. The accepting properties of WS1 and ADP complexes were further explored through fluorescence quenching experiments. Finally, DFT calculations were conducted to elucidate the optimized geometry and frontier molecular orbital compositions. Scheme 1  Synthesis of WS1 molecules and complexes. Experimental sectionMaterials and methods4-tert-Butylphenylacetylene (Aldrich), CuI (Acros), triethylamine (Aldrich), xylenes (Fischer), Pd(PPh3)4 (Aldrich), diisopropylethylamine (Acros), trifluoroboron etherate (Aldrich), zinc acetate (Aldrich), nickel acetate tetrahydrate (Aldrich), and cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (Aldrich) were used as received. Common solvents were obtained from Aldrich or Fisher Scientific. ADP, ADPBF2 and ADP2M were synthesized according to the procedures reported by O'Shea and co-workers.28,401H and 19F NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian AS-400 spectrometer. Chemical shifts (1H) are reported in parts-per-million relative to Si(CH3)4. Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were performed using the optimum combustion conditions by Robertson Microlit Laboratories. UV-Vis spectra were collected on a Cary 500 spectrophotometer in HPLC grade chloroform. MALDI-TOF MS spectra were acquired in reflective negative mode on a Bruker autoflex III smartbeam MALDI-TOF/TOF spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TA instruments Q500 thermogravimetric analyzer. Emission spectra were recorded using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer. The quantum yield of WS1BF2 was determined at room temperature in HPLC grade tetrahydrofuran (THF) relative to zinc phthalocyanine as the reference (Φ = 0.23 in THF).43 Both reference and analyte samples were diluted to obtain a maximum absorbance of less than 0.2. Samples were excited at 654 nm and the quantum yield was obtained using the following equation:  where s and r indices refer to the analyte and reference samples, respectively, A is the absorbance at the excitation wavelength, η is the average refractive index of the solution, and D is the integrated area under the emission spectrum.2,8-Di(4-tert-butylphenylacetylene)-1,3,5,7-tetraphenylazadipyrromethene, WS1. Compound 1 (0.250 g, 0.357 mmol) and CuI (15 mg) were added into a dry flask, and degassed with N2 for 10 min, and evacuated. The reaction flask was charged with Pd(PPh3)4 in the glove box (110 mg). The flask was then taken out of the glove box and xylene (8 mL) and triethylamine (8 mL) were added. Both xylene and triethylamine were dried over molecular sieves and purged with N2 for 30 min prior to use. 4-tert-Butylphenylacetylene (118 mg, 0.748 mmol) was added via a syringe to the purple solution. The reaction mixture was stirred at 70 °C under N2 for 36 h and turned blue. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation, dissolved in chloroform (∼150 mL) and passed through Celite. The solvent was evaporated and the crude product was purified by column chromatography using silica gel (first with 1:4 chloroform/hexanes then with 1:1 chloroform/hexanes) to afford a blue solid.

WS1 (33 mg, 0.044 mmol) was dissolved in dry dichloromethane (DCM) (15 mL) and 100 μL of diisopropylethylamine was added. Trifluoroboron etherate (200 μL) was added to the mixture via a syringe. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The solution was washed with distilled water (50 mL × 2) and dried over anhydrous Mg(SO4)2. The solvent was rotary evaporated to obtain a dark blue solid. The product was further purified by column chromatography on silica gel with 1:1 DCM/hexanes to afford a purple-blue solid.

WS1 (50 mg, 0.067 mmol), zinc acetate [Zn(OAc)2] (13 mg, 0.071 mmol) and 5 mL 1-butanol were mixed and stirred for 2 h at reflux. The solvent was evaporated. The product was dissolved in ∼5 mL of dichloromethane and filtered through Celite.

All glassware was thoroughly cleaned and oven-dried overnight before use. Dichloromethane was distilled over calcium hydride and stored in the nitrogen glovebox. Ferrocene was purified by sublimation. A typical three-electrode configuration was used, with a glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode and two platinum wires as counter and pseudoreference electrodes. Ferrocene/ferrocenium was used as an internal standard. The measurements were performed with a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1 in degassed DCM with tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte. The electrolyte was purged with nitrogen for ∼10 min prior to each measurement.Fluorescence quenchingThe fluorescence of P3HT was monitored as a function of the concentration of aza-DIPY based acceptors. The concentration of P3HT was 10 mg mL−1 in chloroform and the concentration of acceptors (quencher) was varied between 0 and 30 μM. The excitation wavelength was 360 nm. Since the acceptors also absorb at 360 nm, the emission spectra of P3HT were corrected for the inner filter effect at each wavelength using the following equation:  where Fcorr is the corrected fluorescence intensity, Fobserved is the observed fluorescence intensity, Aex is the absorption of solution at 360 nm, Aem is absorption of solution at the fluorescence wavelength being corrected, s is the excitation beam thickness (0.10 cm), g is the distance from the edge of the sample beam to the edge of the cuvette (0.40 cm), and d is the width of the cuvette (1.0 cm). The corrected data were analyzed using the Stern–Volmer equation:   where [Q] is the quencher concentration, Ksv is the Stern–Volmer constant and F0 is the corrected fluorescence intensity of the pure donor (P3HT) at 570 nm and F is the corrected fluorescence intensity of the solution (P3HT + quencher) at 570 nm.The Förster overlap integral was calculated using the MATLab program a∣e UV-Vis Spectral Software 1.0 by FluorTools, using the following equation:44J(λ) = ∫∞0FD(λ)εA(λ)λ4dλwhere FD(λ) is the corrected fluorescence intensity of the donor in the wavelength range λ + Δλ, with the total area under the curve normalized to unity, and εA is the molar absorptivity of the acceptor at λ. The Förster distance (R0) was calculated as follows:R0 = 0.211(κ2n−4QDJ(λ))1/6where κ2 is the transition dipole (κ2 = 2/3), a factor describing the relative orientation in space of the transition dipoles of the donor and acceptor, n is the refractive index of the solvent (1.49 for chloroform), QD is the quantum yield of the donor (QP3HT = 0.33),45 and J(λ) is the overlap integral. The efficiency of energy transfer was calculated using the following equation:   where r is the distance between the donor and the acceptor, assuming that the donor and acceptor are points separated by a fixed distance.Samples for the film fluorescence quenching experiment were prepared by spin coating at 400 rpm for 1 min a filtered (0.2 μm PTFE filter) solution of 10 mg mL−1 P3HT for the neat P3HT film, or solutions of 10 mg mL−1 P3HT and 10 mg mL−1 acceptor for the 1:1 w/w blend films. Film thicknesses were 250 nm to 300 nm. The emission spectra of all films were recorded under the same conditions.DFT calculationsSpin-restricted (Zn) and unrestricted (Ni, Co) density-functional theory calculations proceeded within Gaussian 09 rev. A.02.46 Geometries were fully optimized without imposition of symmetry. Calculations used the exchange-correlation functional of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBEPBE),47,48 and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set for all atoms. Converged geometries were confirmed to be local minima of their potential energy hypersurfaces in harmonic frequency calculations. Continuum solvation in chloroform (ε = 4.9) was specified with the polarizable continuum model of Tomasi and co-workers.49 Mulliken population analyses50 were performed using AOMix by Gorelsky.51,52Results and discussionSynthesisThe synthesis of the new molecules is depicted in Scheme 1. WS1 was synthesized by Sonogashira coupling of 2,8-diiodo-1,3,5,7-tetraphenylazadipyrromethene (1) with 4-tert-butylphenylacetylene, and isolated in 51% yield. The t-butyl groups were chosen because they promoted the solubility of WS1 and its complexes in organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, toluene, xylene, dichloromethane, and chloroform. Column chromatography using a very low loading (e.g. 100 mg for a 6 cm diameter by 40 cm height column) was required to rigorously purify WS1, since the starting material and mono-substituted by-products were difficult to separate from the desired product by other means. WS1 was thus isolated as an air-stable blue powder. The identity and purity of WS1 were confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS, 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis (as detailed in the ESI†). The reaction of WS1 with trifluoroboron etherate afforded an air-stable purple-blue powder, WS1BF2, in 63% yield after isolation. 19F NMR spectroscopy analysis revealed a quartet around 131 ppm consistent with the tetracoordinated state of boron.Homoleptic M(II) complexes of WS1 were synthesized in high yield by reaction of WS1 with the corresponding metal acetates in n-butanol. For comparison, the corresponding ADP, ADPBF2 and ADP2M complexes were also synthesized.28,53 Unlike the ADP2M analogues, the complexes of WS1 did not precipitate out of solution or readily crystallize and were therefore purified by chromatography. All complexes were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF MS and elemental analysis. MALDI-TOF MS confirmed the 1:2 stoichiometry ratio of metal:ligand for all complexes.The 1H NMR resonances for the closed shell, diamagnetic WS12Zn complex were well-resolved and located in the typical 0–10 ppm range. On the other hand, the 1H NMR spectrum of the paramagnetic Co and Ni complexes displayed considerable peak shifts, in a range between 0 ppm and 17 ppm for Co and −1 ppm and 45 ppm for Ni. As mentioned by O'Shea and co-workers about ADP2Ni, the 1H spectrum of the Ni complex is interesting because four coordinate Ni(II) complexes usually prefer to adopt a square planar geometry, but with the tetraphenylazadipyrromethene type ligands, this is not possible due to steric hindrance caused by phenyl groups and the complex adopts a pseudo-tetrahedral geometry instead.53 We expect that Ni complexes of WS1 will behave very similarly, as discussed in the calculation section later. On comparing the 1H NMR of WS12Ni with ADP2Ni, we note that the most downfield signal observed for ADP2Ni is at 61.6 ppm and was assigned to the pyrrolic protons of ADP. Since WS1 does not have any pyrrolic protons, we did not observe any signal near 61 ppm. The most downfield signal we observed is most likely due to the ortho-protons on the phenyl groups of azadipyrromethene that are closest to the metal center. In the case of WS12Ni, these protons have a chemical shift and integrated intensity of 40.98 ppm (8H), compared with 34.6 ppm (8H) for ADP2Ni. The larger chemical shift for the ortho-protons in the complex of WS1 suggests that those protons are closer to the metal center than those of complexes of ADP. This may be due to steric hindrance caused by the phenylacetylene groups that would cause the phenyl groups on the aza-DIPY core to rotate.All aza-DIPY based compounds were thermally stable, with 5% weight loss onsets occurring in the range of 240 °C to 461 °C (see Fig. S11 and Table S1†). The ADP2M complexes were generally more stable (Td 428 °C to 461 °C) than the WS12M complexes (Td 240 °C to 360 °C).Optical propertiesThe UV-Vis absorption spectra and optical properties of the new WS1 compounds are given in Fig. 2 and Table 1. The optical properties of ADP2M are reported in Table S2† and are consistent with the literature.53,41Fig. 2a shows that the absorption spectra of WS1 and WS1BF2 are broader and red-shifted compared to the spectra of their ADP analogues. The λmax in the red region for WS1 was 625 nm, compared to 596 nm for ADP, a bathochromic shift of 29 nm that is attributed to the extended conjugation through the phenylacetylene moieties. The effect was enhanced with BF2 coordination, where a bathochromic shift of 87 nm was observed (λmax = 649 nm for ADPBF2 and 736 nm for WS1BF2). Coordination of BF2 enforces planarity of the aza-DIPY core and reduces rotational freedom at the core.27 The UV absorption bands of WS1 and WS1BF2 are also broader than their ADP analogues due to the absorption of the phenylacetylene groups.

(b) UV/Vis absorption spectra of WS1, WS1BF2 and WS12Co; (c) UV/Vis absorption spectra comparing ADP with WS1 homoleptic metal(II) complexes.

This effect is illustrated in Fig. 2b for the Co(II) complex, where the absorption spectra of the complex are strong between 550 nm and 775 nm, encompassing both the absorption bands of WS1 and WS1BF2. The WS12M complexes have very high molar absorptivities, reaching 91 000 M−1 cm−1 for WS12Zn.Fig. 2c demonstrates that WS12M had broader and significantly red-shifted absorption spectra compared to the ADP analogues, with λmax,red bathochromic shifts in the range of 60 nm to 80 nm. The extinction coefficients at λmax were also all higher for the WS12M complexes. While the WS12M complexes had undetectable fluorescence, WS1BF2 had a measurable fluorescence with a maximum at 792 nm (Fig. S12†) and a quantum yield of 0.06.Electrochemical propertiesThe cyclic voltammograms of the WS1 chelates are shown in Fig. 3 and the electrochemical properties are summarized in Table 2. Table 2 also includes the electrochemical properties of ADP compounds for comparison. WS1 displayed two consecutive reversible reduction peaks and two irreversible oxidation peaks. Compared to ADP, the two reductions of WS1 are shifted anodically by 150 mV and 200 mV, respectively. This observation is consistent with WS1 being able to stabilize the radical anions better than ADP due to the extended conjugation through the phenylacetylene groups. The 1st oxidation of WS1 shifted anodically by 110 mV compared to ADP, due to the electron rich character of the phenylacetylene groups.

Coordination of WS1 with the metals, on the other hand, shifted the first reduction peak cathodically and the second reduction peak anodically, resulting in a smaller difference between the two reduction peaks. For example, the difference between the two E1/2,red for WS12Co was 0.26 V, compared to 0.60 V for WS1. The oxidation peaks shifted cathodically and became more reversible. The difference between the two E1/2,ox also decreased compared to WS1, but the change was not as pronounced as that for the reduction peaks. A similar behavior was observed for ADP2M complexes (Fig. S13†), consistent with the literature.41 These results point to a more delocalized system for the WS12M (and ADP2M) complexes.The nature of the metal(II) center had little effect on the oxidation potentials of the WS12M complexes, suggesting that the first oxidation processes are centered on the WS1 ligands. The nature of the metal had only a small influence on the first reduction process: the peaks of Zn(II) complexes cathodically shifted by 70 mV and 100 mV compared to WS12Co and WS12Ni, respectively. Because this change is very small, we surmise that the metal center is not directly reduced and that the observed reduction processes are ligand centered, consistent with the literature for homoleptic metal(II) complexes of ADP for Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II).41 In contrast, ADP2Cu complexes were reported to be unstable because Cu(II) was directly reduced to Cu(I), resulting in the loss of one ADP ligand.41 All the complexes studied here are electrochemically stable, as indicated by their reversible redox properties.HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated from the E1/2 values in solution and are displayed in Fig. 4. A common and well-studied electron donor poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and electron acceptor phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) were also measured in our laboratory and added for comparison. The comparison with P3HT is approximate because the HOMO–LUMO energy levels of P3HT were estimated from the oxidation onset of films instead of E1/2 in solution. The HOMO energy level of PCBM was estimated using our estimated LUMO energy level and the published HOMO–LUMO gap value of 1.7 eV.54 All aza-DIPY based compounds had a HOMO energy level deeper than the air stability threshold of −5.2 eV,55 suggesting that they should be oxidatively stable in air. The LUMO energy levels of the WS1 series are all well below that of the P3HT donor, and could be tuned from −4.39 eV to −3.83 eV. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of all complexes are appropriate for an acceptor paired with P3HT. We note that based on their LUMO energy levels and reversible oxidation behavior, the metal(II) complexes could also be used as donors in combination with acceptors that have deeper LUMO energy levels. Fig. 4  Estimated HOMO–LUMO energy levels, compared with P3HT and PCBM. Derived from the CV measurements using the value of −5.1 eV for Fc/Fc+. Fluorescence quenchingTo explore the accepting properties of aza-DIPY based compounds, we performed solution fluorescence quenching experiments using P3HT as the donor. All aza-DIPY derivatives were found to quench the fluorescence of P3HT. To quantify the quenching ability of these acceptors, we measured the fluorescence of P3HT as a function of acceptor concentration. This could be done because these aza-DIPY based compounds either do not fluoresce, or, in the case of the BF2 complexes, emit at much longer wavelengths than P3HT and therefore do not interfere with the emission intensity of P3HT monitored at 570 nm. Since the acceptors also absorb at the excited wavelength of 360 nm, the fluorescence intensity of P3HT was corrected for inner filter effects. The corrected fluorescence intensity was analyzed using the Stern–Volmer equation.56 The linear trends were fitted to a straight line and the Stern–Volmer constants were extracted (see Fig. S14–24†) and are reported in Table 2. For comparison, we also performed the same experiment with PCBM. The Stern–Volmer constants for all aza-DIPY based compounds were similar to or higher than that of PCBM, with the exception of ADPBF2, which had a lower Stern–Volmer constant than both PCBM and ADP for reasons that are not understood at this time.Interestingly, the Stern–Volmer constants for the homoleptic metal complexes of WS1 were significantly higher (28000 M−1 to 30000 M−1) than that of PCBM (16000 M−1). If electron-transfer was the only fluorescence quenching mechanism operating, this would suggest a greater ability of the complexes to accept electrons than PCBM. However, because the absorption spectra of these complexes significantly overlap with the emission spectra of P3HT, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is also possible. To quantify the degree of spectral overlap, we calculated the overlap integral, J(λ), and the values are summarized in Table 2. The overlap integrals for WS12M complexes were between 67 × 1014 M−1 cm−1 nm4 and 74 × 1014 M−1 cm−1 nm4. As expected, these overlap integrals are significantly larger than that of PCBM (1 × 1014 M−1 cm−1 nm4). These large J(λ) values significantly increase the probability of having energy transfer from P3HT to WS12M. To assess whether the larger Stern–Volmer constants for the aza-DIPY based compounds were due to FRET, we plotted the overlap integral versus quenching constant (Fig. S25†). Although there is no consistent trend amongst all the aza-DIPY based acceptors, we can say that the complexes having the largest Stern–Volmer constants also tended to have the largest overlap integrals.The larger spectral overlap between the emission of the donor and the absorption of the acceptor also increases the FRET efficiency at a certain distance between the donor and the acceptor. The dependence of the energy transfer efficiency on the distance between donor and acceptor was therefore examined, Fig. S26,† and the Förster distance R0 was calculated and is reported in Table 2. This distance is calculated using the spectral properties of the donor and acceptor, and corresponds to a distance where the energy transfer efficiency is 50%. In our system, this efficiency is an upper bound, because other processes, such as charge transfer, are competing with FRET. R0 values are typically between 20 Å and 60 Å. The calculated R0 values for the aza-DIPY derivatives were between 43 Å and 55 Å, and those for the WS12M complexes were either 54 Å or 55 Å. These latter distances are about twice as large as that of PCBM (26 Å). Although these calculated R0 values are for solution and not for films, we do expect larger R0 for films resulting from the large visible absorption of these complexes. This would be advantageous in organic solar cells and other optoelectronic applications, where FRET has been proposed as a way to increase exciton harvesting. FRET provides a way to efficiently transport excitons to the donor–acceptor interface over larger distances than by exciton diffusion.57–59Since devices use solid-state films and not solutions, we also performed fluorescence quenching experiments in the solid state, comparing the fluorescence of neat P3HT films and of 1:1 w/w blends of P3HT and aza-DIPY based acceptors. We found that, except for ADP, complete quenching of the P3HT fluorescence was observed, Fig. 5. ADP did not completely quench the fluorescence of P3HT, probably due to a larger phase separation between P3HT and ADP (which we have observed by AFM). These experiments indicate that the complexes of ADP and WS1 efficiently quench the fluorescence of P3HT, a pre-requisite for exciton dissociation in organic photovoltaic cells. Fig. 5  P3HT fluorescence quenching with aza-DIPY derivatives in films. Quantum chemical calculationsTo gain a better understanding of the opto-electronic properties of WS12M complexes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the PBEPBE functional with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. To simplify the calculation, the t-butyl groups on WS1 were replaced with hydrogen atoms. Geometry optimizations were carried out with the spin restricted RDFT approach for closed shell molecules (Zn molecules) and with the spin-unrestricted UDFT approach for open shell molecules (Co and Ni molecules). The metal complexes showed a distorted tetrahedral geometry, and the spin state was taken as a quartet, triplet and singlet for cobalt (d7), nickel (d8) and zinc (d10) complexes respectively. No symmetry constraints were enforced, and in all cases, several input geometries were considered in attempting to locate the local minimum energy geometry. Here, we studied (1) optimized geometric structures, (2) cube calculations to generate plots of frontier orbitals, and (3) Mulliken population analysis. All calculations included a continuum treatment of chloroform solvation.Fig. 6 presents the optimized geometry structures obtained for ADP2Zn and WS12Zn. Optimized geometry structures for all other complexes are given in Fig. S27† and selected geometric parameters are compiled in Table S3.† To validate the calculated optimized geometries, we compared the geometric parameters of ADP2M with published crystal structures and found that they were very similar (see Table S3†). The calculated optimized geometries of all metal complexes displayed distorted tetrahedral geometry with the metal-nitrogen bond angles deviating from 109°. Bond and dihedral angles were the same for all metal complexes, and M–N bond lengths were slightly lower for the WS1 metal complexes than for the ADP metal complexes. Examination of the WS12M calculated structures revealed that the proximal phenyl rings of one WS1 ligand lie at a π-stacking distance of 3.6 Å from the pyrrolic ring of the opposite WS1 ligand, just like for the ADP2M analogues. This is illustrated in Fig. 6b. Because there are four proximal phenyl rings (two on each ligand), this results in π–π interactions in four places. In addition, the aza-DIPY core and the phenylacetylene groups are on the same plane, thus extending conjugation of the aza-DIPY core through the pyrrolic positions and providing additional ‘conjugated arms’ that can extend in more directions than the corresponding ADP2M complexes. Fig. 6  (a) Optimized geometry structures for ADP2Zn and WS12Zn in two views; (b) optimized geometry structure of WS12Zn showing interligand π-stacking; (c) optimized geometry structures drawn using the same scale and placed into a box, showing how the size of the molecules was estimated. To estimate and visualize the size of these complexes, we placed the calculated structures into a box, Fig. 6c, and calculated the box dimensions, reported in Table S4.† For comparison, we also estimated the box dimensions for PCBM. The box volumes were approximately 1400 Å3 for PCBM, 1800 Å3 for ADP2M complexes and 4700 Å3 to 5300 Å3 for WS12M complexes. While the box volumes for ADP2M were slightly larger than those for PCBM, the volumes for WS12M were significantly larger than those for PCBM. By comparing WS12M with ADP2M, we find that while the heights are similar, both the width and depth of the WS12M boxes were significantly larger due to the four extra phenylacetylene groups extending in 3D.The calculated energy levels are shown in Fig. 7. The LUMO energy levels of the WS1 series were stabilized compared to the ADP series, similar to what was observed experimentally. The calculated HOMO energy levels for WS1 series, on the other hand, were similar or a bit higher than those for the ADP series, a trend that is different from what was observed experimentally. Estimated HOMO–LUMO energy gaps are smaller than experimentally estimated energy gaps. Fig. 7  Calculated eigenvalues for ADP and WS1 derivatives. One important difference between the free ligands (ADP, WS1) and their corresponding homoleptic metal(II) complexes is that the LUMO and LUMO+1 energy levels are much closer to each other for the complexes than for free ligands. The same trend is observed for HOMO, HOMO–1, and HOMO–2. The increased number of molecular orbitals and the smaller energy gap between them are consistent with the two ligands interacting with each other to create a larger, 3D delocalized structure.The increased electronic delocalization could be due to the coupling with the metal orbitals and/or through the π–π interaction of the two WS1 (or ADP) ligands. We have already established interligand π-stacking. One remaining question is whether the metal orbitals are also involved. To answer this question, we examined the frontier molecular orbitals of all metal complexes, Fig. S28–33.† To help understand the contribution of different parts of the molecule to the molecular orbitals, and to see whether the metals are involved in the conjugated system, we performed Mulliken population analysis. The results for the WS12M complexes are shown in Fig. 8, and those for the ADP2M complexes are reported in Fig. S34.† The fragments used were aza-DIPY core, distal phenyl groups, proximal phenyl groups, metal center and phenylacetylene groups. Looking at the LUMO and LUMO+1 patterns for WS12M compounds, we see that these frontier orbitals are mainly governed by two aza-DIPY cores, accounting for about 2/3 of the molecular orbitals. The other third is roughly split equally between the four phenylacetylene groups, the four distal phenyl groups and the four proximal phenyl groups. Interestingly, the metal contribution to the LUMO and LUMO+1 is minimal, and the Zn(II) shows the smallest contribution of the three. The distribution is similar for ADP2M complexes, minus the phenylacetylene groups. An electron in the LUMO or LUMO+1 molecular orbital would therefore be delocalized over 70 atoms for the ADP2M complexes and 102 atoms for WS12M complexes. For comparison, fullerene's LUMO is delocalized over 60 carbon atoms. This large number of atoms involved in the conjugation system should be beneficial for charge separation.18 Fig. 8  Estimated calculated contribution of different segments of WS12M complexes obtained by the Mulliken population analysis. (a) WS12Co; (b) WS12Ni; (c) WS12Zn. Another interesting result from these calculations is that the contribution from the aza-DIPY core of each ligand to the occupied frontier MOs is nearly equal. This is illustrated in Fig. 8 by using different patterns for each aza-DIPY core coming from each ligand. This result is consistent with the ligands being highly conjugated with each other.In the case of the HOMO and HOMO–1, the contribution from the aza-DIPY cores and the phenylacetylene is about equal. The contribution from the phenyl rings varied, with a larger contribution from the proximal phenyl groups in the HOMO and HOMO–1 and a larger contribution from the distal phenyl groups in the HOMO–2 orbitals.Interestingly, Co(II) had a substantial contribution to the HOMO of WS12Co, whereas Ni(II) contributed to the HOMO–2 of WS12Ni, and Zn(II) did not significantly contribute to any of the three frontier molecular orbitals of WS12Zn. Co(II) and Ni(II) have half-filled d orbitals with unpaired electrons that can delocalize with π electrons of aza-DIPY ligands and contribute to the HOMOs.60–63 On the other hand, Zn(II) does not participate in frontier MOs because it has filled d orbitals with a closed shell electronic configuration [Ar]3d10 and no free unpaired electrons to delocalize with π electrons of aza-DIPY. In these complexes, therefore, Zn(II) plays the role in supporting and bridging the two aza-DIPY ligands, which has been observed for other zinc(II) complexes.64 These calculations suggest an hypothesis for why Co(II) and Ni(II) complexes absorb at longer wavelengths than the Zn(II) complexes: Co(II) and Ni(II) metals may contribute to extending conjugation whereas Zn(II) does not.ConclusionsWe extended the degree of conjugation of 1,3,5,7-tetraphenylazadipyrromethene (ADP) by combining two approaches: installing phenylacetylene groups at the pyrrolic positions and making homoleptic metal(II) complexes. The resulting complexes had broad intense red to near infrared absorption with onsets at around 800 nm. They exhibited two reversible reduction and two reversible oxidation peaks, as observed by cyclic voltammetry, and their estimated HOMO and LUMO energy levels could be tuned depending on the ligand and metal used. We showed for the first time that homoleptic metal(II) complexes of WS1 and of ADP quench the fluorescence of P3HT efficiently, both in solution and films, a pre-requisite for efficient exciton dissociation. Due to their strong absorption in the visible, the homoleptic complexes were found to have large overlap integrals with the donor emission, and the estimated Förster distances were large, 52 Å to 55 Å, about twice as long as that of PCBM. Although these R0 values obtained in solution are not the same as R0 distances that would be obtained in donor–acceptor blend films, they do suggest that these highly absorbing aza-DIPY acceptors can enhance FRET, a process that can be used to increase exciton harvesting. DFT calculations showed that the complexes are large, conjugated systems. The electronic delocalization results from the π–π stacking interaction between the two ligands, consistent with the reported crystal structure of ADP2Zn.39 This combination of properties makes homoleptic metal complexes of WS1 and of ADP promising candidates for use in organic solar cell applications, especially as the next generation of soluble non-fullerene acceptors with absorption complementary to current polymer donors. Further work is underway to study their solid-state properties and test them in solar cells. The BF2 chelate could also find applications in biological imaging and light emitting diodes.AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to the National Science Foundation (CHEM 1148652) for funding this project.
