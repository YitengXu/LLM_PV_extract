    , Accepted 27th May 2015First published on 5th June 2015AbstractRecently, solar cells with hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites have achieved a great success and their power conversion efficiency reaches about 17.9%. For practical applications, one has to avoid the toxicology issue of lead, to develop lead-free perovskite solar cells by using metal substitution. It has been shown that tin is one of possible candidates as a replacement for lead. Herein, a step-by-step protocol based on the first-principles calculations is performed to investigate the geometrical and electronic properties of mixed Sn and Pb perovskite MAPbxSn1−xI3 with different crystal symmetries. At first, a GGA functional with the inclusion of the van der Waals interaction, vdW-DF3, is used to optimize the geometries and it reproduces closely the unit cell volume. Then, a more accurate hybrid functional PBE0 combined with the spin–orbit coupling effect is used to perform electronic-structure calculations. The calculated results reveal that the band gaps of MAPbxSn1−xI3 are sensitive to the ratio of Sn/Pb, and are proportional to the x component, consistent with the previous reports. Further investigations show that the crystal symmetry can also modify the band gap in an order of Pnma > I4cm > P4mm at x = 0.5. The random rotation of organic cations, which makes the band alignments in the compounds, facilitates the separation and transfer of holes and electrons. Interestingly, the computed binding energies of the unrelaxed exciton have the same trend as band gaps, which decreases with decreasing x, the binding energies of MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 also decrease as the crystal symmetry decreases, implying a faster exciton dissociation with lower x and lower symmetry at an ambient temperature.
I. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites, introduced in 2009 by Kojima et al.1 for solar cells, have been attracting considerable attention in the scenario of emerging photovoltaic technologies. Perovskites have the capability to efficiently convert sunlight to electricity, and the reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) attained with methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) has been in excess of 17% in photovoltaic cells,2–14 much higher than those of liquid dye sensitized cells, and various thin film-based photovoltaics. Among lead halide perovskites, MAPbI3 has been proven to be the most successful photosensitive material and a stable crystal.15 However, despite surging efficiencies, the problems such as environmental pollution caused by Pb and the chemical stability of materials are highlighted and have to be overcome. Taking into account the pollution, several studies have suggested to develop Pb-free perovskite solar cells by using metal substitution.16,18 As a group 14 element with a comparable ionic radii, Sn was first explored to replace Pb in solar cells.17,20 Transition metals such as Ge2+, Cu, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni have also been found to be promising alternatives to Sn and Pb, owing to their rich chemistries and multiple oxidation states. Some successful implementation of Pb-free perovskites as photovoltaic absorbers has been observed, and the related studies have been reviewed in ref. 18.
However, methylammonium tin iodide (MASnI3) perovskites are less stable than their lead counterparts due to the facile oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+. The measured PCE in MASnI3-based solar cells is around 6%,17,20 much lower than that based on MAPbI3. Recently, the photovoltaic performances of all-solid state mixed Sn and Pb halide-based perovskite solar cells are reported.21,22 It has been demonstrated that the increasing Sn concentration in CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3 lowers the band gap,19,21,22 and shifts the electronic absorption spectra to a long wavelength regime (about 1060 nm). These mixed materials are also environmentally friendly. To build the structure–functional relationship and further enhance PCE, gaining insight into the inherent mechanism of the photovoltaic performance and the micro-physical information on mixed Sn–Pb halide perovskites is essential and becomes urgent. Several theoretical studies on the (opto)electronic properties of MAPbI3 and MASnI3 have thus been performed recently (e.g., ref. 23–31). The possible ferroelectric order in these systems has also been investigated.42–48 In spite of the wide interest in halide perovskites, the characterization of their hybrid structures and the understanding of their chemical and physical properties are still in an early stage. For instance, different phase structures of mixed Sn–Pb halide perovskites in different environments and the corresponding electronic properties have not been investigated. In particular, the rotation of organic molecules within halide perovskites at room temperature, which significantly affects the structures of MAPbI3, should also appear in the mixed Sn–Pb halide perovskites. The exciton properties of mixed Sn–Pb halide perovskites with different symmetries, such as binding energy, are important for their performance in solar cells. In this paper, we therefore focus on describing the structure–property relationship of mixed Sn–Pb MASnxPb1−xI3 with different crystal symmetries.
Perovskites are intrinsically complex materials, and there are various types of interactions and structural disorders. Two tetragonal structures and one orthorhombic structure composed of four MAPbI3 units have been observed. Besides, in the perovskite crystals, CH3NH3+ is bound to [PbI6]−4 octahedra by hydrogen-bonding interactions and CH3NH3+ cations therefore exhibit a dynamic-disordered tetragonal perovskite phase at room temperature even without illumination. These structure manifolds may also appear in MASnxPb1−xI3. It is therefore interesting to see how different ratios of Sn/Pb, phase symmetry and the orientational disorder of organic cations affect the geometric and electronic properties. Here we calculate not only their geometric and band structures, but also the effective masses of valence and conduction bands and the binding energies of the unrelaxed exciton. The effective mass and the exciton binding energy give the clues to the speed of carrier motions and exciton dissociation, respectively. Meanwhile, different orientations of CH3NH3+ in cavities between [PbI6]−4 octahedra are also investigated, and the effect on the geometric and electronic structures of MASnxPb1−xI3 will be revealed.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly introduces the theoretical methods and the computational details. In Section 3, the calculated results are presented and analyzed. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 4.
II. Computational details
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out within the plane wave basis and pseudopotential framework as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).49–51 The standard projected augmented wave (PAW) potentials has been used for H, I, Sn and Pb elements, and soft potentials for C and N elements. An energy cutoff of 280 eV is employed and the atomic positions are optimized using a conjugate gradient scheme without any symmetric restrictions until the maximum force on the each of them is less than 0.02 eV Å−1. The potentials and the energy cutoff of 280 eV adopted by our calculations have been confirmed to be suitable for MAPbI3 systems of Menendez-Proupin et al.,24 who have performed test calculations with hard PAW potentials for carbon and nitrogen, which have a maximum cutoff of 400 eV, and found that with hard PAW potentials, variable cell relaxation gave a cell volume of only 2% larger than with soft potentials, and the C–N bond distance variation is smaller than 0.01 Å. In this work, we thus adopt soft potentials for C and N elements and an energy cutoff of 280 eV.
In this work, compounds MAPbxSn1−xI3 with crystal symmetries Pnma and P4mm are modeled with 3 × 2 × 3 Γ-centered grids for k-point sampling while those with crystal symmetry I4cm are modeled with 3 × 3 × 2 Γ-centered grids for k-point sampling. Test calculations have been done for similar systems with k-point grids up to 7 × 5 × 8 in ref. 24, showing that the current k-point grids are sufficient which allow the total energy converged within 0.01 eV per atom.
The DFT functional, vdW-DF3,54 which includes the dispersion interaction, is used to perform the structure relaxations. This functional is expected to improve the accuracy of predicted geometric and electronic structures. To get stable phase structures for the above compounds, we optimize the lattice parameters by performing explicit calculations for the energy as a function of volume. Initially, the experimental lattice parameters are used as starting guesses and the forces on the atoms are minimized at a given cell volume where the ratios of the unit cell vectors are fixed at the experimental values. To change the volume, we only change a unit cell vector but keep the ratios of vectors unchanged, and constructed cell volumes spanning about 4% of the experimentally reported values.
The hybrid DFT functionals, PBE052 or HSE,53 appear to be capable of capturing the complex correlated physics of this class of oxide materials and have been proposed to be applied for the band structures of perovskites.55 Here we combine PBE052 with the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect to perform the calculations of (opto)electronic properties of MASnxPb1−xI3 since the SOC, operated on the CB, has been found to have a dominating effect on the band gap of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite lead.31 The hybrid functional PBE0 includes a fraction α, of screened, HF exchange to improve the derivative discontinuity of the Kohn–Sham potential for integer electron numbers. In the calculations, we set α = 0.248 since this value can yield excellent agreement between the computed and experimental direct band gap (1.65 eV)20 for the MAPbI3 phase with a tetragonal crystal symmetry (I4cm).
III. Results and discussion
A. Geometric properties
The mixed Sn–Pb halide perovskites have typical compounds MAPbxSn1−xI3, where x scan rates are from 1 to 0. The MAPbxSn1−xI3 adopts the perovskite-type structure consisting of a network of corner-sharing [PbxSn1−xI6]−4 octahedra in which the metal site is randomly occupied by either Sn or Pb atoms. The two end members, namely MAPbI3 and MASnI3, crystallize in pseudocubic P4mm and tetragonal I4cm space groups, respectively, under ambient conditions, as indicated in the previous experimental studies.21,32–34 With the increasing temperature (at ∼330 K), MAPbI3 undergoes a reversible structural phase transition from the I4cm to P4mm space group, and becomes isostructural to MASnI3. Meanwhile, the same structural transition is seemly observed in the MAPbxSn1−xI3 solid solution for an x ∼ 0.5 value at room temperature.21
To balance the computational cost and computational accuracy in this work, we relaxed MAPbxSn1−xI3 with space group I4cm with different values of x (1.0, 0.75, 0.50, 0.25 and 0), and MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with space groups Pnma and P4mm, which are tetragonal with a total of four units of MAPbI3 or MASnI3 per cell. Before discussing the effect of crystal symmetry on geometries, we show the x component dependence of geometries. The results demonstrate that the optimized lattice constants exhibit a maximum difference of only 0.05 Å from the experimental values of MAPbI3 and MASnI3,21,32 shown in Table 1, much better than those obtained by the PBE functional without vdW interactions reported in previous literature.35,36 Due to the smaller radii of Sn than Pb, the optimized volumes decrease associated with reduced values of x, also in agreement with experimental observations.21,22 In the absence of experimental values, the lattice parameters of compound MAPb0.25Sn0.75I3 are optimized with the same ratios of the unit cell vectors of MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3. Table 2 shows the calculated angles (θ, see Fig. S1 in the ESI†) of the octahedra tilting and the ranges of Pb–I and Sn–I bond lengths in compounds with different x values. It is found that the angles follow the same trend of the lattice constants, i.e., the angles decrease with decreasing x. The Sn–I and Pb–I bond lengths are in the ranges of 3.11–3.18 Å and 3.16–3.28 Å, respectively, for the compounds MAPbI3 and MASnI3. For the mixed Sn–Pb halide perovskites, Pb–I and Sn–I bonds both coexist in the compounds, resulting in some Pb–I bond lengths slightly decreasing and some Sn–I bond lengths slightly increasing.

We now focus on the crystal symmetry. Fig. 1 shows the models of MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with symmetries Pnma, I4cm and P4mm (a supercell containing  cubic cells is constructed for P4mm symmetry). It is interesting to note that the four metal sites are occupied by two Pb and Sn atoms with two different modes, namely, ortho- and meta-modes, only in the compound MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3, and this compound is also demonstrated to be the best candidate for photo-absorption by an experiment.21,22Table 1 lists the obtained results at the minimized-energy geometries of MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with symmetries Pnma, I4cm and P4mm. In the case of P4mm symmetry, the ortho occupying mode displays slightly larger lattice constants than the meta occupying mode. In contrast, for symmetries Pnma and I4cm, the lattice constants are nearly independent of occupying modes. Meanwhile, with the decrease of symmetry, the compound volumes increase with an order, Pnma < I4cm < P4mm, and mass densities become smaller.
 Fig. 1  Optimized structures of MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with symmetries Pnma, I4cm and P4mm (front view and top view). The metal sites are occupied by two Pb and Sn atoms with two different modes, namely, ortho- and meta-modes. Blue = N, gray = C, white = H, brown = I, dark = Pb and purple = Sn. 

Table 2 lists the calculated angles and bond lengths. It is noted that the only compound with symmetry I4cm has obvious angles (θ) of the octahedra tilting. The Sn–I and Pb–I bond lengths of compounds with a lower symmetry have broader ranges than that with a higher symmetry. These properties may be explained by the rotations of organic cations. In the compounds with a lower symmetry, the organic cations rotate more freely in the cavities between [Pb0.5Sn0.5I6]−4 octahedra. Through the interaction between organic cations and halogens by H–I hydrogen bonds, Pb–I and Sn–I bond lengths change randomly and lead to a broader distribution.
B. Band structures and band gaps
As indicated by previous studies,32,33 structural transitions of MAPbI3 undergo different crystal symmetries with increasing temperature. The same structural transition could be realized in the MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 solid solution at room temperature.21 Herein, we thus focus on the electronic structure calculations for the six models, ortho-MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 and meta-MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with symmetries Pnma, I4cm and P4mm. Fig. 2 shows the band structures of MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 produced by the PBE0 functional without the SOC effect. It is seen that the band gaps of MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with both the occupying modes become narrower with a lower symmetry. However, MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with a meta occupying mode has a broader band gap than the ortho occupying mode. Table 3 obviously displays those band gaps together with those of MAPbxSn1−xI3 with a I4cm symmetry for comparison. Meanwhile, we find that the topology of band structures is influenced by the occupying modes. The high valence bands (VBs) in a range of −2 to 0 eV, whose top energies are located at the Γ points, become more dispersive and more separating with the meta occupying mode. In contrast, the effects are not obvious for the low conduction bands (CBs).

To investigate the SOC effect on electronic structures, we calculate the band structures and density of states (DOS) for all six models by the PBE0 functional with and without the SOC effect. Fig. 3–5 display the calculated band structures and DOS of MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with symmetries Pnma, I4cm and P4mm, respectively. The corresponding data are summarized in Table 3. It is observed that the SOC effect makes the energy gaps narrower for all the structures, and it becomes stronger with a lower symmetry and leads to a narrower energy gap in an order of Pnma > I4cm > P4mm. Interestingly, the dominating effect of SOC on the band structures is to lower the CB minimum (CBM), whereas it keeps the VB maximum (VBM) nearly unchanged. It is also noted that the energy gaps of compounds with a meta occupying mode are broader than those with an ortho occupying mode.

 Fig. 5  Band diagram and DOS of compounds MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with symmetry P4mm computed by PBE0 + SOC. The valence band at top is set to zero. 
An experiment was conducted to measure the band gap of MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with symmetry P4mm and showed a measured value of 1.17 eV,21,22 which is very close to our calculated value of 1.16 eV for the meta-MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with symmetry P4mm. It is thus expected that the experimental compound should correspond to the meta occupying mode because the band gap with the ortho occupying mode is 1.05 eV, smaller than the experimental value. Comparing the geometry of meta-MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with a strawberry-cake-type structure, the ortho-MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 has a sandwich configuration alternately stacked by a layer of [PbI6]−4 octahedra and a layer of [SnI6]−4 octahedra. From the chemical intuition, the meta occupying mode is expected to be a more reasonable configuration.
We further investigate the electronic properties by varying the values of x components in MAPbxSn1−xI3 with symmetry I4cm (the band structures are shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI†). From the results calculated by the PBE0 functional without the SOC effect, we find that the band gaps of MAPbxSn1−xI3 decrease with decreasing x, in agreement with the experimental studies.21,22 When the SOC effect is switched on, the VBs keep almost unchanged whereas the low-lying CBs become more separated (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†). As x increases, the energy space of low-lying CBs becomes larger and band gaps become narrower. No matter with and without the SOC effect, the x-dependence tendency of band gaps is similar. Fig. 6 shows the band gap variation versus the x component, and Table 3 also summarizes the results. For the compounds MAPbxSn1−xI3, the CBMs have the characters of the p orbitals of Pb and Sn atoms. Note that the SOC effect is mainly associated with the Sn and Pb centers, and the heavy Pb atoms have a stronger SOC effect than Sn atoms. Therefore, an increase of Pb atoms greatly enhances the SOC effect. Consequently, the reduction of band gaps induced by the SOC effect decreases with decreasing x.

C. Optoelectronic properties
In perovskite-based solar cells, the PCE is significantly influenced by the carrier mobilities, which are closely related to the effective masses of carriers. We therefore calculate the effective masses of MAPbxSn1−xI3 by fitting the energy dispersions of VBM and CBM to parabolic functions along different k directions in the vicinity of Γ point. Table 4 presents the effective mass tensors calculated by PBE + SOC, where mxx, myy and mzz correspond to the Γ–X, Γ–Y and Γ–Z directions, respectively. Among MAPbxSn1−xI3 with symmetry I4cm, MAPbI3 has the largest averaged masses for both electrons (mc) and holes (mv), and the value of mc is smaller than mv, agreeing with the previous calculations.23,36 Generally, the average electron and hole masses decrease with decreasing x. MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with symmetry P4mm has the smallest average electron and hole masses due to the lowest symmetry. Meanwhile, we also calculate the reduced exciton masses . It is found that the calculated reduced exciton mass of 0.143 m0 (m0 is the electron mass) for the compound MAPbI3 with symmetry I4cm agrees well with the experimental value of 0.15 m0.37 With increasing x, the reduced exciton masses μ decrease and the compound MASnI3 has the smallest reduced exciton mass. Similarly, the lower symmetry results in smaller reduced masses for compounds MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3.

In order to estimate the magnitude of excitonic effects on the band gaps, we calculate the exciton-binding energies using a simple Wannier exciton model.38 The exciton-binding energy in the Wannier model is given by Eb = μ/ε∞E1s, where E1s is the energy of the fundamental state of hydrogen atoms, μ is the reduced exciton mass and ε∞ is the dielectric constant. The dielectric constants are calculated at a DFT level using density functional perturbation theory39,40 with a 4 × 4 × 4 k-point grid. The obtained dielectric constant of 6.5 for MAPbI3 is in agreement with the experimental dielectric constant of 6.5.41 The binding energy of MAPbI3 with symmetry I4cm is 45.6 meV, which closely matches the experimental value of 50 meV measured from optical absorption spectra.37 The computed binding energies of the unrelaxed exciton of compounds MAPbxSn1−xI3 with symmetry I4cm have the same trend of band gaps (see Table 4), and they decrease with decreasing x. Meanwhile, the binding energies with respect to the symmetry are in the order of Pnma > I4cm > P4mm. For compounds MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with symmetries Pnma and I4cm, the calculated binding energies of meta-MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 are slightly larger than that of ortho-MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3. However, the calculated binding energy of ortho-MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 is somewhat larger for compounds MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with symmetry P4mm. Omitting the small difference of binding energies at different occupying modes, the order of the binding energies decrease with lower symmetries, implying a faster exciton dissociation of the compounds MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with a lower symmetry at an ambient temperature.
D. Effect of orientational disorder of organic cations on the properties
To gain insight into the variation of the electron structures induced by the disorder of organic cations CH3NH3+, we investigate the properties of meta-MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with symmetry P4mm, in which the organic cations are arranged along with four different orientations (see Fig. 7). Fig. 7 shows that different orientations of the organic cations significantly affect the structures of meta-MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3, and it is seen that H–I hydrogen bonds significantly change the angles of octahedra tilting. Fig. 8 displays the corresponding DOS of the four models, and the calculated band gaps are about 1.16, 1.55, 1.62 and 1.25 eV, respectively. Obviously, different organic cation orientations tune the visible light absorption range of meta-MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3. At room temperature, a large number of organic cations rotate in the cavities in between octahedra. The random rotations result in different band structures in local regions, and perform the band alignments in compounds meta-MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3. The band alignments in compounds would facilitate the spatial separation and transfer of holes and electrons, as indicated by our previous studies.56,57 Similarly, other compounds MAPbxSn1−xI3 with symmetry P4mm should have similar properties.

IV. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have performed a step-by-step protocol based on the first-principles calculations to investigate the geometrical and electronic properties of MAPbxSn1−xI3 with symmetry I4cm, and MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with symmetries Pnma and P4mm. First, the structures of MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with symmetries Pnma, I4cm and P4mm are built and optimized. The functional, vdW-DF3, closely reproduces the experimental volumes of unit cells. Then, the electronic structures are calculated by the hybrid functional PBE0 with the SOC effect. The computed band gaps of MAPbxSn1−xI3 with symmetry I4cm decrease with decreasing x, in agreement with experimental and other theoretical results.19,21 Through investigating compounds MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with three different symmetries, we have found that compounds with lower symmetries have smaller band gaps in an order of Pnma > I4cm > P4mm. In contrast, the band gap reductions induced by the SOC effect have the opposite trend, with an order of Pnma < I4cm < P4mm. The meta-MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 have a broader band gap than the ortho-MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 in case of the same symmetry. At a room temperature, the band alignments induced by organic cation rotations in MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with symmetry P4mm would facilitate the spatial separation and transfer of electrons and holes. The computed binding energies of the unrelaxed exciton have the same trend of band gaps, i.e., they decrease with decreasing x, implying a faster exciton dissociation with a lower x at ambient temperature. For the MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 with different symmetries, a low symmetry leads to a smaller binding energy. The present calculations provide an interpretative basis and theoretical framework to gain insight into the observed structure–property relationship of the hybrid organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite materials. The different phases of perovskite and doping proportion affect the properties of perovskites, which should be considered as a key factor when designing perovskite-based devices.
