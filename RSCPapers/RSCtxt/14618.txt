Herein, by investigating the prominent temperature dependence of electrocatalytic water oxidation catalyzed by first row transition metal oxides, we present how to elevate the operating temperature of the electrolyzer as an effective and universal method to improve its electrocatalytic performance. Consequently, a triple device model combining a photothermal collector with a photovoltaic (PV) cell coupled to a water splitting device is proposed to realize the comprehensive and efficient utilization of solar energy: solar heat + PV + electrolyzer.
Introduction
The development of renewable energy systems is crucial for the modern civilization of human beings since the fossil fuels consumed nowadays not only damage the environment but also cause climate change.1 Fortunately, these problems could be solved if more than 0.01% of the solar energy shone on the Earth could be converted into fuels for human usage.2 Solar energy can be utilized by photothermal, photovoltaic (PV) and photochemical conversion. Currently, the main commercialized domestic applications for using solar energy are solar heat collectors (photothermal conversion) and silicon solar cells (photovoltaic conversion). However, exploiting applications based on the photochemical conversion of solar energy is extremely valuable for extending the utilization techniques of solar energy.3
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells have been designed to realize the photochemical conversion of solar energy into renewable clean fuels (e.g. H2, CO, HCOOH, CH3OH, CH4).2,4 Recently, different types of PEC cells have been reported for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen; some of which can possibly be further developed into practical devices.5 We note that the indirect conversion system based on a PV cell-coupled electrolyzer (PVE) device shown in Fig. 1 is more attractive for large scale application and closer to potential commercialization. The PVE device completes the complicated solar-to-fuel process by separating it into two processes, photovoltaic conversion and water electrolysis,6 making the design and fabrication of the whole system much simpler. In addition, it can protect the light harvesting part from the damage caused by the electrolyte and the catalytic reactions. Recently, a number of successful PVE devices have been reported, such as AlGaAs/Si cell coupled RuO2/Ptblack (with a solar to hydrogen efficiency (ηSTH) of 18.3%),7 3jn-a-Si cell coupled Co–OEC/NiMoZn (with a ηSTH of 4.7%)8 and perovskite tandem cell coupled NiFe LDH/NiFe LDH (with a ηSTH of 12.3%).9

The water oxidation reaction can release four protons and four electrons, which can be used to produce fuels of hydrogen or carbon-based chemicals, such as CO and HCOOH. However, water oxidation is a remarkably difficult energy-uphill reaction.10 Therefore, water oxidation anodes with low overpotential and high current density–voltage characteristic are the key determinants for building a PVE device with high ηSTH. Plenty of efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation have been developed during the past few years.11–17 In order to further improve the activity of an existing efficient water oxidation electrocatalyst, such as Co–Pi14 and NiFeOx,13 we discuss and highlight the possibility of elevating the operating temperature of the electrolyzer as a simple, feasible, and efficient way to enhance the activity of metal oxide based water oxidation anodes. The remarkable temperature dependences of Co–Pi, Ni–Bi and Cu–Bi water oxidation anodes were studied in this work. Moreover, we proposed a triple device model integrated with solar heat (photothermal collector) and a PVE device to realize the comprehensive and efficient utilization of solar energy.
Results and discussion
As a well-known water oxidation electrocatalyst, Co–Pi films with different thickness were first prepared by electrodeposition via passing through different amounts of charge.14 The catalytic activities of the as prepared Co–Pi anodes were investigated under various temperatures that are controlled by a double-walled electrolytic cell connecting with a thermostatic water bath circulator (Fig. S1†). All potentials reported herein were referenced to NHE. The LSV curves of the thin Co–Pi film in 0.1 M pH 7.0 phosphate buffer solution at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 2a. As the temperature increases from 15 °C to 65 °C, the catalytic current densities dramatically increase, while the catalytic onset potentials decrease with a temperature coefficient of −5.6 mV °C−1 (Fig. S2†). The potential for reaching a current density of 1.0 mA cm−2 decreases from 1.29 V to 1.04 V when the temperature is raised from 15 °C to 65 °C. The bulk electrolysis of the thick Co–Pi film was performed at 1.4 V under various temperature conditions (Fig. 2b). The steady current densities at 1.4 V greatly increase with the elevated temperature. The current density of 5.8 mA cm−2 reached at 65 °C is over four times higher than that at 15 °C, 1.39 mA cm−2. The plots of the current density at 1.4 V versus the temperature express a linear relationship with a slope of 0.9 mA cm−2 per 10 °C (Fig. S3†). When biased galvanostatically at 2 mA cm−2, the potential applied on the electrolyzer operating at 65 °C is 1.22 V, which is 250 mV lower than that at 15 °C (Fig. S4†). The above results distinctly show that the catalytic activity of Co–Pi can be promoted by simply elevating the operating temperature.

To verify that the effect of elevating temperature is both effective and universal, Ni–Bi18 and Cu–Bi19 anodes were also prepared according to reported methods and investigated electrochemically under various temperatures. As expected, the catalytic current densities of both Ni–Bi and Cu–Bi anodes at 1.3 V are dramatically increased with elevating temperature. The temperature effects on the current densities of Ni–Bi and Cu–Bi anodes at 1.3 V are 0.7 mA cm−2 per 10 °C and 0.62 mA cm−2 per 10 °C, respectively (Fig. S5 and S6†). Moreover, the potentials applied to Ni–Bi and Cu–Bi anodes at 65 °C for obtaining a current density of 2.0 mA cm−2 are respectively 400 mV and 350 mV lower than those at 15 °C (Fig. S7 and S8†). Therefore, the catalytic properties of the Ni–Bi and Cu–Bi anodes are also dramatically promoted by the elevated operating temperature. Remarkable increases in catalytic activities of NiFeOx, NiO/Ni–CNT and Cr2O3-blended NiO under strong alkaline conditions have been reported very recently by other groups as well.20–22 Photoanodes, such as WO3 and BiVO4, have also shown significantly enhanced activity by simply increasing the operating temperature.23,24 All these results provide evidence that elevating the operating temperature of the electrolyzer can be an effective and universal method to further improve the performance of water oxidation anodes.
Complementally, we suggest that a specific value of temperature instead of “room temperature”, which is a generalized fuzzy concept, should be clearly mentioned in the literature when reporting a new water oxidation anode activity. Although “room temperature” has an agreed upon value of 23 °C in science fields, it is normal that the difference between the winter “room temperature” in a lab located in a high-latitude area and the summer “room temperature” in a lab located in a low-latitude area can be over 20 or even 30 degrees. Moreover, we do regard that a 10 degrees fluctuation of room temperature in one lab is normal, especially between winter and summer, or between noon and evening. However, the activity of the anode may even be doubly changed when the operating temperature changes in the range of room temperature (15 °C to 30 °C). This can be clearly evidenced by the temperature-dependent results of Co–Pi, Ni–Bi and Cu–Bi anodes from the present work.
Understanding the origin of the remarkably improved activity at high temperature is significant for applying this simple but efficient method to developing a more advanced device. Various aspects related to the elevated operating temperature will influence the catalytic activity. First, the thermodynamics of the water oxidation reaction (eqn (1)) is altered by the elevating temperature. The Gibbs free energy (ΔG) is mathematically expressed as eqn (2), where ΔH is the enthalpy and ΔS is the entropy of the reaction.25 The reversible potential (Erev) based on the Gibbs free energy is given by eqn (3), where F is the Faraday constant. Considering that Gibbs free energy is temperature-dependent, an empirical expression of the reversible potential for water oxidation has been reported to model this behavior (eqn (4)).26 On the other hand, influenced by the concentration of the reactants and products, the reversible potential is evolved to give the Nernst potential (ENernst), which is given by eqn (5). Consequently, the change of Nernst potential resulting from the elevated temperature can be given in eqn (6). H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−(1) ΔG = ΔH − TΔS(2) (3) Erev = 1.23 − 0.9 × 10−3(T − 298)(4) (5) ΔE = (0.9 × 10−3 + 1.99 × 10−4pH)ΔT(6)
Substituting pH = 7.0 into eqn (6) results in a slope of −2.3 mV °C−1 which is the temperature coefficient of the water oxidation reaction attributed to thermodynamics.
The experimental temperature coefficient (−5.6 mV °C−1) of the onset potential of the Co–Pi anode is substantially higher than the one (−2.3 mV °C−1) deduced from the thermodynamic change of the water oxidation reaction. This is because the thermodynamics and kinetics of the catalytic process occurring on the Co–Pi catalyst also contribute to the temperature coefficient of the onset potential. This is evidenced by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the thin Co–Pi film at various temperatures in Fig. 3. The CV curve obtained at 15 °C showed an oxidation peak attributed to CoII/CoIII at 0.97 V and a reduction peak at 0.83 V.27 Comparatively, one more oxidation peak corresponding to the pre-equilibrium redox process CoIII–OH ↔ CoIV–O obviously appeared in the CV curves obtained at temperatures higher than 25 °C, indicating that the kinetics of the catalytic process are influenced by the operating temperature.27 As the temperature increased from 15 °C to 65 °C, both the oxidation and reduction peaks shifted to more negative potential, from 0.97 V to 0.78 V, and from 0.83 V to 0.68 V, respectively. After fitting the plots of the oxidative potentials and the corresponding temperature, a good linear relationship with a slope of −3.8 mV °C−1 was found (Fig. S9†). Moreover, the redox peak currents obviously increase with the elevation of temperature, revealing that the rates of catalytic processes are promoted by the elevated operating temperature. These changes evidence that the thermally increased activity of Co–Pi catalyst is contributed to not only by the thermodynamic promotion of the water oxidation reaction but also the thermodynamically and kinetically improved processes of the catalyst, such as CoII → CoIII and CoIII–OH ↔ CoIV–O etc.27

The other factors such as pH value, insulation resistance (iR) and mass transport are also affected by the operating temperature, and these factors may bring changes to the catalytic activity as well. The slight decrease of the buffer solution’s pH values during elevating temperature were recorded in Fig. S10.† Since the pH change is slight and can simply be compensated by adding base to the electrolyte, its negative effects on activity is negligible and solvable. The iR of the electrolyzer equipped with a thick Co–Pi anode slightly decreases with the elevated temperature (Fig. S11†). The smaller iR of the electrolyzer at high operating temperature is beneficial to enhancing the catalytic current density at a certain potential. Simply based on Fick’s law, Nernst-type diffusion and the Stokes–Einstein equation, the mass transport can be mathematically presented as:22 (7)where D is the diffusion coefficient, cb is the concentration of electrolyte, x is the diffusion layer thickness, k is Boltzmann’s constant, a represents the ion radius and μ is the viscosity of the solution. It is clear from the eqn (7) that the mass transport increases with temperature. Therefore, the enhancement of the catalytic reaction at high temperature is also due to the improved mass transport, especially when the catalytic current density is high.22 In addition to the above factors, the rate of gas evolution from the electrode surface is also related to activity and changes with increasing temperature. High rate of gas evolution results in less accumulation of bubbles on the electrode surface that will facilitate mass transport and reduce solution resistance. Gas solubility increases with the elevating temperature, which consequently reduces the formation of bubbles on the surface of anode.22 On the other hand, a higher temperature causes bubbles having higher thermal energy to leave the surface.22,28 Hence, the acceleration of gas evolution by elevated operating temperature in addition enhances the activity of an electrolyzer as well.
The above results and discussions clearly prove that elevating the operating temperature can efficiently improve the electrocatalytic activity of a water oxidation anode thanks to the enhancement of many factors involved in the reaction. On the other hand, photothermal collectors have been widely used in domestic life for obtaining hot water. Therefore, combining a photothermal collector with a PVE device to perform the electrolysis under high temperature can be a simple and promising way to realize water splitting more efficiently at high temperature. The proposed triple device (T-device) model is shown in Fig. 4a. Potentials required for driving the electrolyzer in the T-device is: E = ENernst + ηOER + ηHER + ηΩ(8)where ENernst is the thermodynamic potential required for water splitting, ηOER is the overpotential for oxygen evolution, ηHER is the overpotential for hydrogen evolution, and ηΩ represents the overpotential for overcoming the iR. All these potentials will be dramatically reduced when the photothermal collector supplies heat to elevate the operating temperature of the electrolyzer. Consequently, the water splitting taking place in the electrolyzer of the T-device is driven by the PV cell and promoted by the photothermal collector, realizing comprehensive and efficient utilization of solar energy (photothermal, photovoltaic and electrochemical conversion).

For the purpose of clearly displaying the superiority of a T-device, we simulate in Fig. 4b the property of a T-device by coupling the J–V curves of a Co–Pi Ni foam anode and Pt cathode integrated electrolyzer with the J–V curve of a hypothetical solar cell (ηPV = 18.6), which was obtained by adjusting the J–V curve of a reported GaInP cell.6,29,30 Operating point I in Fig. 4b represents the performance of a normal PVE device working at 25 °C. Operating point II represents the performance of the PVE device working at 55 °C, namely showing the performance of a T-device. Generally, the ηSTH of a PVE device can be calculated by: (9)where Je is the water splitting current density, ηFar is the Faradaic efficiency, JMP and VMP are the current density and potential of the PV cell at the maximum power point, respectively. Assuming a ηFar of 100% is reached, ηSTH of the above PVE at 25 °C and 55 °C can be calculated. As a result, the ηSTH of the PVE device increases from 9.5% to 15.7% when the operating temperature of the Co–Pi Ni foam anode integrated electrolyzer was raised from 25 °C to 55 °C. Hence, compared to a PVE device with the same PV cell and electrolyzer, the T-device can produce more fuels from solar energy due to the assistance of thermal energy provided from the photothermal collector, revealing the superiority of the T-device for future domestic usage.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated the prominent temperature dependence of electrocatalytic water oxidation by metal oxide based anodes. The observed dramatically enhanced activity is mainly attributed to the thermodynamic promotion of the water oxidation reaction, the thermodynamically and kinetically improved processes of the catalyst, enhanced mass transport and bubble evolution. Consequently, elevating temperature as an effective and universal method for improving the performance of water oxidation anodes was presented and a T-device model was proposed for the production of solar fuels. In addition to solar water splitting for hydrogen generation, this T-device model can also be used with the electrolyzer where water oxidation occurs at the anode and CO2 reduction occurs at the cathode, generating carbon based fuels, such as CO, HCCOH or CH3OH. Since photothermal collectors have been widely used in domestic life, the proposed T-device model is a feasible, valuable and promising candidate for future domestic usage of solar energy conversion. This work provides a simple strategy to improve the efficiency of integrated solar conversion devices without changing the electrode material and the light absorber, realizing comprehensive and efficient utilization of solar energy.
Experimental section
Materials
Ultra pure water (18.2 MΩ cm−1) for all the reactions or measurements was obtained from a Milli-Q system. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates were purchased from Pilkington (resistance of ∼8 Ω cm−2) and were previously cleaned by an ultrasonic bath in water and ethanol for 30 min. All other chemicals for preparation of Co–Pi, Ni–Bi and Cu–Bi anodes are commercially available from Sigma Aldrich.
Preparation of metal oxide based water oxidation anodes
Co–Pi, Ni–Bi and Cu–Bi anodes were prepared from electrodeposition method according to the related literature.14,18,19 In a typical experiment, a three-electrode cell equipped with a FTO electrode (1.0 cm2) as the working electrode, a Pt mesh as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl aqueous KCl (3.5 M) as the reference electrode was used for electrodeposition.
The thin Co–Pi anode was deposited from a solution of 0.1 M pH 7.0 KPi containing 0.5 mM Co(NO3)2·6H2O by bulk electrolysis at 1.4 V vs. NHE with passage of 100 mC cm−2 charge. The thick Co–Pi anode was deposited from a solution of 0.1 M pH 7.0 phosphate buffer (KPi) containing 0.5 mM Co(NO3)2·6H2O by bulk electrolysis at 1.4 V vs. NHE for 2.0 hours.
The Ni–Bi anode was deposited from a solution of 0.1 M pH 9.2 KH2BO3/H3BO3 electrolyte (KBi electrolyte) containing 1.0 mM Ni(NO3)2·6H2O by bulk electrolysis at 1.3 V vs. NHE for 10 hours.
The Cu–Bi anode was deposited from a solution of 0.2 M pH 9.0 KBi electrolyte containing 1.0 mM Cu(NO3)2·3H2O by bulk electrolysis at 1.3 V vs. NHE for 3.0 hours.
Co–Pi modified Ni foam (Co–Pi NF) was obtained according to the method of Nocera’s work.29 Deposition of the Co–Pi on the 1.0 cm2 Ni foam was performed in 150 ml solution of 0.1 M MePi buffer (pH 8.5) electrolyte containing 1.0 mM Co(NO3)2·6H2O applying a bias of 1.3 V vs. NHE with vigorous stirring to mitigate Co2+ mass transport limitations within the Ni foam.
Electrochemical measurements
A CHI 660e potentiostat was employed for all electrochemical experiments. Electrochemical experiments were run in a three-electrode single-compartment cell. The cell was a double-walled electrolytic cell which was equipped with Co–Pi, Ni–Bi or Cu–Bi electrodes as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl (3.5 M KCl in water) as the reference electrode. All potentials reported herein were referenced to NHE (E(Ag/AgCl) = 0.205–7.3 × 10−4(T − 25) V vs. NHE). Linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry and long-term controlled-potential electrolysis were carried out in 0.1 M pH 7.0 KPi buffer for the Co–Pi anode, in 0.1 M pH 9.2 KBi buffer for the Ni–Bi anode and 0.2 M pH 9.0 KBi buffer for the Cu–Bi anode, respectively, at various temperatures. The temperature was controlled by connecting the double-walled electrolytic cell with a thermostatic water bath circulator (Fisher Scientific Polystat 36) as shown in Fig. S1.† Bulk electrolysis of the Ni–Bi anode and the Cu–Bi anode were carried out with stirring.
Simulation of a T-device
The electrolyzer for simulating the T-device was built with a Co–Pi NF as the anode, a Pt mesh as the cathode, 1.0 M pH 7.0 KPi buffer solution as the electrolyte and a double-walled electrolytic cell for controlling temperature. The linear sweep voltammetry of the electrolyzer was measured at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 with slight stirring. The J–V curve of the hypothetical solar cell was obtained by increasing the Voc by 10% and decreasing the Jsc by 10% of a reported GaInP cell.6,30
