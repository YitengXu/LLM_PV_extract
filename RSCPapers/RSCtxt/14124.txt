    , Accepted 15th November 2013First published on 22nd November 2013AbstractA simple method has been developed to synthesize reduced graphene oxide (rGO)–AgTCNQ and rGO–copper–TCNQ nanocomposite films (TCNQ = 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane) from electrodeposited rGO–Ag and rGO–Cu films. The method is based on voltammetric co-reduction of a dispersion containing graphene oxide and a silver or copper metal cation precursor followed by reaction of the rGO–metal films with TCNQ. The morphologies of the organic charge transfer nanomaterials, AgTCNQ and copper–TCNQ, are reaction time dependent. Introduction of the metal–TCNQ nanostructures leads to p-doping of reduced graphene oxide. Pure phase II AgTCNQ nanorods/nanocubes were generated in the reduced graphene oxide film whereas pure phase I copper–TCNQ micro/nanorods grew along the reduced graphene oxide structure. In the Cu case, the bulk material was fully consistent with formation of microcrystalline CuTCNQ but evidence for an underlying film which includes nanocrystalline CuTCNQ (1.3:1 Cu:TCNQ ratio) and Cu2+ species was also obtained. The achievement of semiconducting phase II AgTCNQ or phase I CuTCNQ in the reduced graphene oxide structure may provide a route for the development of electronic switching devices.
Introduction
7,7,8,8-Tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) is an excellent electron acceptor. This feature, along with the presence of the four cyano groups in the structure (Fig. 1) and the propensity to undergo π–π stacking, allows TCNQ to form stable compounds with a wide diversity of electron-donating materials,1–5 to give M+(TCNQ)˙− salts or organic semiconducting complexes with higher order stoichiometries, such as (n-Bu4N)2(TCNQ)5.6
 Fig. 1  Molecular structure of TCNQ. 
Micro- or nanostructured metal–TCNQ materials such as CuTCNQ and AgTCNQ have gained special attention for their semiconducting properties as well as on/off switching characteristics, which make these materials promising candidates for information technology applications, in areas such as erasable photochromatic laser disks and memory storage devices.7,8 The on/off switching characteristics of AgTCNQ and CuTCNQ arise from their capacity to exist in two different stable states,9 with transformation between the two states being achieved by electrical or optical stimuli. For AgTCNQ, the two states are represented in eqn (1): (1)
On the left hand side of this equation, the fully charge transferred salt, Ag+TCNQ−, is said to be in the “off” state, while the “on” state on the right hand side is due to a partial dissociation of AgTCNQ into neutral Ag and TCNQ entities.10
AgTCNQ and CuTCNQ can be synthesized by a wide variety of methods to produce different morphologies, phases and film thicknesses on substrates. These include (a) spontaneous electrolysis wherein neutral TCNQ molecules in solution react with redox active metallic species;11 (b) electrochemical methods, utilizing electroreduction of TCNQ in solution in the presence of [Cu(MeCN)4]+ or [Ag(MeCN)4]+,12,13 (c) photoinduced crystallization based on photochemical reduction of TCNQ in acetonitrile in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor and the relevant metal cation14 and (d) approaches such as chemical vapor deposition of TCNQ on metal surfaces and other synthetic methods involving TCNQ and metal salt precursors.15–17
Graphene sheets that are used as the CuTCNQ or AgTCNQ substrate in this study consist of a 2D layer of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, arranged in a hexagonal lattice. This substrate material exhibits impressive mechanical and electronic properties18 (mechanical stiffness = 1 TPa,19 charge-carrier mobility = 250000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature20 and thermal conductivity = 5150 W m−1 K−1).21 Interest in making, processing and doping of graphene based materials to obtain new functionalities is growing rapidly.22–24
Combinations of graphene and nanoparticles have provided the basis for new applications in gas sensing (graphene/WO3),25 lithium ion batteries (graphene–Co3O4)26 and electrochemical pseudocapacitors (graphene/Ni(OH)2).27 The preparation of these graphene–metal composites is normally carried out by chemical or thermal reduction of mixtures containing graphene or graphene oxide (GO) and metallic precursors. Typically, multiple step synthetic methods are employed using toxic chemicals and high temperatures. An alternative synthetic approach that has emerged recently is simple, fast and green and utilizes the one-step electrochemical codeposition of reduced graphene oxide (rGO)–metal composites. This method has facilitated the preparation of Au28 and PtNi29 graphene composites for sensor applications.
A property of graphene that limits its application in some areas is its zero-gap characteristic. Surface functionalization with TCNQ (a p-dopant) increases the band gap of graphene.30,31 It has been reported that stacking graphene multilayers enhances the extrinsic conductivity, and the power conversion efficiency for use in high-performance organic solar cells.32 Moreover, using layer-by-layer graphene–TCNQ stacked films can significantly increase the hole carrier concentration and decrease the device sheet resistance.33 In contrast, the preparation of rGO–metal–TCNQ nanocomposites has not been explored in the literature. In this context, we now report the synthesis and characterization of rGO–AgTCNQ and rGO–CuTCNQ nanocomposites, based on the reaction of metal nanoparticles embedded in reduced graphene oxide structure in a confined system with TCNQ. We also examine the morphology and phase behavior associated with the formation of rGO–AgTCNQ and rGO–CuTCNQ nanocomposites.
Experimental
Chemicals
Potassium ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6]), AgNO3, 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquidodimethane (TCNQ) and KCl (Aldrich), Na2HPO4 (Fluka), tri-sodium citrate and acetonitrile (Merck) and CuSO4 (Univar) were used as received from the manufacturer. Deionized water from a Milli-Q-MilliRho purification system was used to prepare all aqueous electrolyte solutions.
Graphene oxide was prepared from natural graphite (crystalline, 300 mesh, Alfa Aesar) using the Hummers method.34
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass slides (surface resistivity: ∼15 Ω per sq, Flexitec) were cleaned by sequential sonication in acetone and ethanol for 10 min.
Electrodeposition of rGO–Ag and rGO–Cu films
The electrodeposition of the rGO–Ag film was achieved by a method similar to the ones reported in the literature.28,35,36 In this particular study, the potential of the working electrode (glassy carbon or FTO) was cycled ten times at a scan rate of 0.05 V s−1 between 0.0 and −1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl to reduce graphene oxide and AgNO3 from an aqueous solution containing 1 mg mL−1 of graphene oxide, 0.05 M Na2HPO4 and 0.1 mM AgNO3. The electroreduced graphene oxide deposits and aggregates onto the electrode surface. To enhance the deposition rate, the solution was maintained under constant magnetic stirring. rGO–Cu film electrodeposition was achieved from a stirred solution containing 1 mg mL−1 of graphene oxide, 0.05 mol L−1 Na2HPO4, 0.5 mM CuSO4 and 2.5 mM of tri-sodium citrate by cycling the potential for 10 cycles between −0.5 and −1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl using glassy carbon (GC) or FTO working electrodes at a scan rate of 0.05 V s−1. Tri-sodium citrate was introduced to prevent precipitation of Cu2+ as a phosphate complex.
All solutions used in electrochemical experiments were purged with nitrogen for 15 min before measurements started, and then the cell was maintained under a positive pressure of nitrogen at all times.
rGO–AgTCNQ and rGO–copper–TCNQ nanocomposite film preparation
To obtain rGO–MTCNQ (M = Ag or Cu) films, the precursor rGO–metal nanoparticle film was washed with high purity water to remove any electrolyte components that may have been present in the film and then dipped into a 10 mM TCNQ solution in acetonitrile for 5 s or 15 min at room temperature (295 ± 2 K). After reaction, the films were washed twice with 5 mL of acetonitrile. Control experiments were also carried out by dipping a Ag or Cu wire into a 10 mM TCNQ solution in acetonitrile for 15 min followed by washing with acetonitrile.
Electrochemistry
Voltammetric experiments were carried out using a CHI 760D electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Austin, Texas, USA) with a three-electrode cell arrangement. For electrodeposition experiments, a glassy carbon (3.0 mm diameter) or an FTO working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and a Ag wire sealed in a glass tube containing 3 M KNO3 with a porous glass frit separating it from the solution was used as a quasi-reference electrode. The potential of the Ag quasi-reference electrode was calibrated against a Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) reference electrode using the mid-point potential of the Fe(CN)63−/4− couple obtained from cyclic voltammograms derived from an aqueous electrolyte solution containing 1 mM K3[Fe(CN)6] and 0.1 M KCl. All potentials are referenced to Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl).
Other instrumentation
Raman spectra of films deposited onto FTO substrates were obtained with a Renishaw Invia confocal micro-Raman spectrophotometer. An Innova Ar+ laser (514.5 nm) was used as the light source with a power of 0.2 mW over the 3000–500 cm−1 range.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected from nanocomposite samples deposited on FTO using an FEI Quanta 3D FEG SEM instrument equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer. EDX analysis was conducted at 5 kV.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of AgTCNQ and CuTCNQ surfaces deposited on FTO were obtained using a VG ESCALAB 220i-XL spectrometer equipped with an Al X-ray source which emitted a photon energy of 1486.6 eV at 10 kV and 22 mA. Survey scans were carried out over the 1200–0 eV binding energy range with 1.0 eV step size and 100 ms dwell time. Narrow high resolution scans were run over the 20 eV binding energy range with 0.05 eV step size and 250 ms dwell time. The base pressure in the analysis chamber was below 7.0 × 10−9 mbar.
The grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns were obtained from the films deposited on the FTO substrate with a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA coupled with a thin film analysis attachment THA-1101. The incidence angle was 0.1° with respect to the film surface, and a scanning 2θ angle of 5–60°.
Results and discussion
rGO–AgTCNQ nanocomposite films
Cyclic voltammetric reduction at a glassy carbon electrode of the exfoliated GO dispersion in aqueous 0.05 M Na2HPO4 electrolyte containing 0.1 mM AgNO3 is presented for 10 cycles of potential over the range of 0.0 to −1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl in Fig. 2A. The process at about −1.15 V is attributed to the reduction of oxygen surface groups of GO to give reduced graphene oxide.37,38 Standard potential data suggest that reduction of Ag(aq)+ to give Ag(metal) should occur at the initial potential and hence well in advance of GO reduction,39 and indeed over the entire potential range displayed in Fig. 2A. The continuous increase of the current with each cycle of potential is consistent with the deposition of highly conducting material onto the GC electrode. Electrochemical generation of a rGO film on GC (Fig. S1†) and FTO electrodes in the absence of AgNO3 occurs with significantly smaller currents implying that rGO deposition is more efficient in the presence of Ag nanoparticles.

(B) Cyclic voltammograms obtained in aqueous 0.5 M KCl electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 for (a) a GCE, (b) a rGO modified GC and (c) a GC–rGO–Ag electrode. 
The capacitance current derived from electrodeposited reduced graphene oxide films on GC was studied over the potential range of −0.1 to −0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.1 M KCl solution using cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 2B, the capacitance current lies in the order of GC < rGO–GC < rGO–Ag–GC which is as expected if the surface area of the electrode is increased by rGO modification and particularly when accompanied by introduction of Ag nanoparticles. The rGO–Ag electrode is highly stabile for at least 50 cycles of potential as shown in Fig. S2a† and shows the expected linear dependence on the scan rate (Fig. S2b†).

Fig. 3 presents SEM images of rGO and rGO–Ag films electrodeposited on FTO. The rGO film (Fig. 3a) is constructed from multilayers of reduced graphene oxide. In the rGO–Ag film case (Fig. 3b), the SEM image shows an array of Ag particles with a diameter of ∼25 nm. EDX analysis of deposited rGO (Fig. 3c) shows the presence of C, attributed to reduced graphene oxide along with O and Sn related to the FTO substrate. The presence of the O peak also may be attributed to functional groups on the rGO. For rGO–Ag films, EDX analysis (Fig. 3d) confirms the presence of Ag in the film.

The modified FTO electrodes were fabricated by electrodeposition from aqueous 0.05 M Na2HPO4 solution of (a) reduced graphene oxide from a GO solution and (b) rGO–Ag from a GO solution containing AgNO3 using 40 cycles of potential between 0 and −1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) in both (a) and (b). 
When rGO–Ag films on FTO substrates were immersed in 10 mM TCNQ acetonitrile solutions for 5 s or 15 min followed by washing with acetonitrile, the films became royal blue (Fig. S3†), consistent with the formation of blue AgTCNQ.40,41 SEM images (Fig. 4) show that when the reaction of the rGO–Ag film with TCNQ is carried out for only 5 s, AgTCNQ nanorods of size ∼120 nm × 1 μm embedded in the rGO (Fig. 4a). On the other hand, when the reaction is allowed to occur for 15 min, the formation of AgTCNQ nanocubes (180 nm) is detected on the rGO layers (Fig. 4b). The change in morphology may be a result of the partial solubility of AgTCNQ in acetonitrile.42 After AgTCNQ rods form they can partially dissolve and redeposit onto the growing layer of AgTCNQ. The net effect is to cause the rods to change into the nanocube morphology.

EDX analysis (Fig. 4c) of composites found after 5 s or 15 min is similar. The presence of C and Ag is retained, but now N (0.4 eV) from TCNQ, not observed in the rGO–Ag film, is detected, and corroborates the formation of rGO–AgTCNQ. Although SEM images show reaction time dependent morphologies, X-ray diffraction data (Fig. 4d) provide convincing evidence that the same crystalline structure (phase II)15 of AgTCNQ is present in both cases. Analysis of the intensity ratio of the peaks at 9.9 and 10.4 degrees (related to the (002) and (020) planes,41 respectively) suggests that the AgTCNQ nanorods have a preferential growth direction in the (020) plane.

Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectra derived from the different films prepared on FTO, while Table 1 summarizes the data obtained from these experiments. All Raman spectra of the carbonaceous materials (Fig. 5a–c) display the typical bands expected for carbonaceous materials: the D band related to the presence of disorder in the sp2 carbon network; the so-called G band, associated with the sp2 carbon atom vibrations along the structure axis and the 2D (or G′) band, corresponding to a second order dispersive Raman mode.43,44 The G mode frequency blue shifts as a function of both electron and hole doping.45–47 We can see a blue shift for GO (Fig. 5b) compared to graphite (Fig. 5a). This shift is attributed to the presence of the reduced number of sheets, and the presence of isolated double bonds separated by functional groups on the carbon network of GO.48 The electrochemical reduction of GO and consequent formation of rGO (Fig. 5c) restore the G band to 1592 cm−1, indicating the recovery of the hexagonal network of carbon atoms with defects.49

The presence of Ag nanoparticles in the graphene structure gives rise to a blue shift in the G′ band (compared with graphene) as a result of the interaction between the reduced graphene oxide and Ag nanoparticles (Fig. 5d).
After rGO–AgTCNQ formation, the Raman spectrum (Fig. 5e) contains features that are characteristic of AgTCNQ.50 Raman spectra of AgTCNQ formed by dipping a Ag wire into a TCNQ acetonitrile solution are shown in Fig. 5f. In this case, overlap with reduced graphene oxide bands is avoided. Clearly, the Raman vibrations obtained from solid TCNQ (Fig. 5-g) are affected by reduction to TCNQ− and coordination to Ag(I). In particular, the shift of 18 cm−1 to lower energy for the 2226 cm−1 band (CN stretching) along with a reduction of its relative intensity provides a Raman fingerprint for the formation of AgTCNQ.51 Important information also comes from analysis of the rGO bands in the absence and presence of the AgTCNQ. Table 1 shows that the presence of the p-charge transfer dopant (AgTCNQ)52,53 gives rise to a further Raman G-band shift. This is consistent with stiffening of this band by p-type doping that is achieved by electrochemical doping54 when applying negative top/back gate voltages on graphene. The G′ band also shifts to higher wavenumbers indicating graphene doping by holes.55
The formation of AgTCNQ was further confirmed by XPS analysis (Fig. S4†), with the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 signals showing essentially identical binding energies for the Ag 3d orbital in accord with Ag(I),56 and also presenting a spectrum characteristic of a single oxidation state for silver,57 with very high symmetry and low full width at half maximum (FWHM), which suggests that Ag exists as Ag+ in the structure.58
rGO–copper–TCNQ nanocomposite films
In principle, it would be expected that the analogous electrochemical synthesis approach used for rGO–Ag nanocomposite formation could be extended for rGO–Cu film preparation. However, addition of Cu2+ leads to a precipitate being formed in aqueous 50 mM Na2HPO4 media. Tri-sodium citrate were therefore added to the dispersion containing GO and Na2HPO4 to form a soluble copper(II)-citrate complex and hence avoid copper-phosphate precipitation. Another important consideration leads to a change in the potential range used for rGO–Cu deposition during cyclic voltammetric experiments. In order to prevent oxidative stripping of the Cu metal from the electrode, the potential range scanned was restricted to −0.5 to 1.4 V. Under these conditions, cyclic voltammograms obtained during rGO–Cu film deposition on GC (Fig. 6a) exhibit similar characteristics to those obtained for the rGO–Ag case. That is, an increase of the current occurs on cycling the potential, as expected with electrochemical deposition of rGO–Cu.

(d) EDX analysis of samples shown in (b) and (c). 

Bulk microcrystalline material on the surface of the substrate. 
SEM images of the rGO–Cu film on FTO (Fig. 6b and c) reveal the presence of nanoparticles of ∼30 nm diameter, homogeneously distributed along the reduced graphene oxide structure. The presence of Cu and C (along with O from the substrate of carbon functional groups) was verified by EDX analysis, as shown in Fig. 6d. In order to obtain rGO–copper–TCNQ films, the rGO–Cu precursor films were dipped in 10 mM TCNQ acetonitrile solution for either 5 s or 15 min. Copper–TCNQ formation as a function of reaction time was tracked using SEM. Microrods with a diameter of 0.4 μm and a length of 1 μm (approximately) were found to be embedded in the reduced graphene oxide structure when the reaction time was 5 s (Fig. 7a). In contrast, much smaller nanorods with dimensions of 180 nm × 0.7 μm size were observed when the reaction time was increased to 15 min (Fig. 7b). Thus, while the surface confined material is referred to as a CuTCNQ film, in reality an array of microcrystals has been formed. The variation in crystal size, as a function of reaction time, for CuTCNQ compared with AgTCNQ may arise from their different solubilities in acetonitrile. The process of metal–TCNQ formation involves three steps: (i) growth, (ii) partial dissolution and (iii) saturation leading to the deposition of solid. For AgTCNQ, a reaction time of 15 min is sufficient to allow the complete process to occur. However, for Cu–TCNQ, due to the higher solubility in acetonitrile compared with AgTCNQ, a reaction time of 15 min is insufficient to allow complete saturation, allowing dissolution and formation of smaller nanorods compared to those detected with a 5 s reaction time. Dunbar et al. reported that the kinetically formed CuTCNQ (phase I) is sparingly soluble in acetonitrile and that saturation that accompanies conversion to thermodynamically favored phase II only occurs after 1 hour reaction time.16

EDX data were consistent with the formation of copper–TCNQ with Cu, C and N being detected (Fig. 7c). XRD data obtained from rGO–copper–TCNQ films are presented in Fig. 7d. After a 5 s reaction time, characteristic diffraction features associated with phase I copper–TCNQ are detected.16,59 The XRD diffractogram collected after 15 min reaction time is still dominated by features characteristic of phase I copper–TCNQ, indicating that no significant phase change occurs during the 15 min reaction time. This conclusion is supported by cycling voltammetric experiments with copper–TCNQ material adhered to a GC electrode (Fig. S5†) which shows only the presence of phase I.60 Thus, conversion of kinetically favored phase I to thermodynamically favored phase II has not occurred, suggesting that phase I copper–TCNQ is very stable in the composite on the timescale of the experiments.
The electrolysis method of forming copper–TCNQ utilizes the fact that a solution of TCNQ reacts spontaneously with bulk copper metal (wire, film, plate, etc.). Copper–TCNQ phase I (kinetically favored product), is formed rapidly followed by slow conversion to copper–TCNQ phase II (thermodynamic material), resulting in a mixture of the two phases on a Cu plate.61 In the case of the arrays of copper microcrystals prepared in this work, the quantity of copper available for reaction on the surface of the nanoparticles is much less than that of copper bulk metal, limiting the generation of copper–TCNQ and consequently phase conversion can be controlled.62 This phase I structure exhibits electrical conductivity due to the band structure induced by π–π interactions within the column structure.16 Switching behavior caused by the change of electronic structure from full charge-transfer to the partial charge-transfer form (see eqn (1) for the Ag case) is characteristic of phase I of copper–TCNQ. Consequently, the stable phase I rGO–copper–TCNQ composite film prepared selectively may be advantageous in some device applications.59,63
Copper–TCNQ films on FTO were also analyzed by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 8A). The rGO–Cu structure (Fig. 8a) displays the typical carbonaceous bands discussed above with reference to Fig. 5, suggesting the maintenance of the rGO structure after the co-electrodeposition of Cu. After copper–TCNQ formation (Fig. 8b), the carbonaceous bands seen in Fig. 8a are retained, and features attributed to the symmetric modes (A1g) of copper–TCNQ64,65 are found as seen more clearly in the spectrum of copper–TCNQ (Fig. 8c) formed by dipping a Cu wire in acetonitrile. An important outcome of Raman studies of the rGO–copper–TCNQ film (Fig. 8b) is the shift and broadening of the band assigned to CN stretching 2215 cm−1, from 2227 cm−1 found for neutral TCNQ (Fig. 8d), attesting the presence of TCNQ˙− in the copper–TCNQ structure.64–66 UV-Vis analysis of the film (see Fig. S6†) also confirms the generation of TCNQ˙−, via noting the bands at 437 and 647 nm, which can be attributed to intramolecular transitions in copper–TCNQ and intermolecular charge transfer between two TCNQ˙− units,64 respectively.

Underlying the nanocrystalline thin film on the surface of the substrate. 
The bulk microcrystalline material formed on the substrate is CuTCNQ. However, careful inspection of Raman spectra analysis (Fig. S7†) after prolonged washing with acetonitrile revealed the presence of the band at 1183 cm−1. The material giving rise to this spectral feature has been assigned to a contribution from the TCNQ dianion, indicating that a different stoichiometry is possible for very thin copper–TCNQ films.67 The Cu–TCNQ nanocrystals giving rise to this Raman band have the stoichiometry Cu–TCNQ = 1.3:1 and so have an excess of Cu, relative to that in the bulk CuITCNQ material identified above.
After copper–TCNQ preparation, and again after extensive washing with acetonitrile, the presence of a dark green film was noted (Fig. S3†). This color does not accord with the classic dark blue color obtained for bulk CuITCNQ material prepared by the reaction of TCNQ in acetonitrile and Cu metal.61,68,69 Instead, it is an indicative of either Cu2+ formation as in CuII–TCNQ material,69–71 non-stoichiometric material obtained from CuITCNQ,67 as revealed in Raman spectra (Fig. S7†), or other CuII compounds.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to probe the Cu oxidation state in the very thin film of nanocrystalline surface confined material. Fig. 8B shows one example of the copper 2p core electron spectra derived from the reaction of copper with TCNQ. Major peaks arising from the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 electrons, located at 955.2 and 935.5 eV, respectively, are observed, combined with intense shakeup satellites, on the higher binding energy sides of the 2p peaks, characteristic of an open 3d9 shell of Cu2+ species.72–75 Shoulders at 953.0 and 933.2 eV are also present on the Cu 2p peaks.
The broadened Cu 2p peaks can be mathematically resolved into two peaks separated by approximately 2 eV, with the lower energy one being assigned to Cu0/+ and the higher one to Cu2+.73,75,76 The relative Cu2+ content estimated from analysis in the particular case shown in the inset in Fig. 8B is ∼88%, so there is only a small contribution from Cu0 and/or Cu+. Since the Cu 2p binding energies of Cu0 and Cu+ are very close, the Cu 2p peaks at 953.0 and 933.2 eV cannot be used to resolve these two redox levels.76,77 Therefore, the detection of Cu0 and/or Cu+ peaks in the thin film can be attributed to: (1) the presence of residual copper nanoparticles which remain from incomplete reaction with TCNQ,40 (2) XPS-induced reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+,78,79 where this reaction is favored by the presence of carbonaceous materials,73,80 (3) the presence of a small amount of bulk CuITCNQ, and (4) the presence of Cu2O. In other samples examined, the Cu+ redox level detected by XPS was dominant, but Cu2+ was always detected (≥20%).
The high Cu(II)/Cu(I) ratio seen by XPS in material predominantly devoid of bulk microcrystals of CuITCNQ suggests that CuII material is the major component of this thin film.81 Given that TCNQ2− is present in thin film as evidenced by Raman spectra, this implies that bulk CuITCNQ may disproportionate in part to CuII–TCNQ2− based material. The Cu–TCNQ ratio in some nanocrystals is 1.3:1(ref. 67) and the presence of both TCNQ− and TCNQ2− has been established. The detection of Cu2+ by XPS could therefore be attributed to the formation of a CuII–TCNQ nanomaterial, stabilized by the graphene environment, which can act as a cross-link matrix.82,83 Alternatively, residual stabilization by citrate or other ions adsorbed to the reduced graphene oxide surface could occur so that more negative potentials than usual are needed for CuII reduction.84 Cu2+ detection in XPS data could arise from oxidation of Cu nanoparticles to CuO that occurs rapidly and before reaction with TCNQ.79,85 XPS experiments with the Cu–rGO film before the reaction with TCNQ (Fig. S8†) are dominant by Cu+/Cu0,76,77 but do show some Cu2+ content (≤25%) observed for the rGO–copper–TCNQ composite film. Another potential compound is DCTC− (α,α-dicyano-p-toluoylcyanide) as studied by Qi et al.,86 which may form Cu2+ complexes that are difficult to reduce.
In summary, the nanocrystalline thin film probably contains a mixture of non-stoichiometric CuTCNQ with a ratio of Cu–TCNQ = 1.3:1 and Cu2O.

Conclusions
The electrochemical codeposition of rGO–Ag and rGO–Cu nanocomposite films was achieved by the simple one-step electrochemical reduction process of GO and Ag+ or Cu2+ (cyclic voltammetric conditions). With this method, well-dispersed materials with a high density are loaded into the electrochemically reduced graphene oxide. The rGO–Ag and rGO–Cu nanocomposites provide effective precursors for the formation of rGO–AgTCNQ and rGO–copper–TCNQ materials. The inclusion of metal TCNQ compounds provides p-doping of the rGO. The ability to tune the morphologies of organic charge transfer nanomaterials by controlling the reaction time is also shown. The use of Cu nanoparticles leads to the formation of phase I CuITCNQ as bulk microcrystalline material, providing rGO–copper–TCNQ material with important characteristics involving its application in memory devices and switches, but also another Cu2+-base TCNQ material. However, nanocrystalline material having a different composition to the bulk material is also present.
