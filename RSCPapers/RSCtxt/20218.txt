    , Accepted 14th August 2015First published on 14th August 2015AbstractSemiconductor nanostructures with photocatalytic activity have many potential applications including remediation of environmental pollutants and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. An effective way of promoting photocatalytic activity is by creating heterogeneous photocatalysts. In this paper, a hybrid nanostructured photocatalyst with desired three-dimensional (3D) nanoarchitecture by assembling Sn3O4 nanosheets on N-doped TiO2 nanotubes has been constructed with enhanced broad spectrum photocatalytic properties, which can harness UV and visible light to decompose organic contaminants in aqueous solutions and split water to hydrogen. Photocatalytic tests showed that the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures possessed a much higher degradation rate of methyl orange and hydrogen evolution rate than that of the unmodified TiO2 nanotubes, N-TiO2 nanotubes, Sn3O4 nanosheets and Sn3O4/TiO2 hybrid nanostructures. The mechanism related to the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity was discussed. Deposition of Sn3O4 nanosheets onto N-TiO2 nanotubes resulted in a dramatic increase in light-induced generation of hydroxyl radicals, superoxides and singlet oxygen, and the production of holes and electrons. This work is the first instance of combining Sn3O4 with N-TiO2, the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures show good photocatalytic performance. This study is potentially applicable to a range of 3D hybrid nanostructures with promising applications in photocatalysis and relevant areas.
Introduction
In modern society, the technology of semiconductor-based photocatalysis for degrading environmental pollutants and splitting water to produce hydrogen by taking advantage of solar energy has been considered as one of the most important approaches to solving the world energy crisis.1 Hence, the development of necessary semiconductor photocatalysts has undergone considerable research.2 Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been widely investigated as a photoanode for photodegradation and water splitting because of its favorable band-edge position, strong optical absorption, superior chemical stability and anti-photocorrosion properties, biocompatibility3 and low cost.4,5 However, pure TiO2 can only absorb ultraviolet light which accounts for only about 4% of the energy of the sunlight, due to its large bandgap (3.2 eV for anatase), which greatly impedes its widespread applications.6,7 Therefore, developing highly active photocatalysts coupled with efficient photocatalysis techniques is valuable.8
Now, many methods have been developed to pursue highly active photocatalysts: firstly, reducing the band gap of photocatalysts to the visible light region through bandgap engineering including metal and non-metal doping in semiconductors to broaden the absorption from the UV region to the visible light region.9 In particular, due to the compatible size of oxygen and the small formation energy required for the substitution of Ni, N, V and Co, they have been widely used as the dopant to modify the electronic structure of oxide semiconductors.10–13 Secondly, exploring novel kinds of photocatalysts with a narrow bandgap, in which Sn3O4 has been experimentally confirmed to possess absorption bands in the visible-light region, has attracted a great deal of attention for its good photocatalytic performance in energy conversion14 and remediation15 under visible light irradiation, which accounts for about 48% of the incoming solar energy, due to the comprehensive understanding of heterovalent semiconductor oxides. Thirdly, constructing hybrid nanomaterials with different semiconductor or semiconductor/metal nanoparticles is demonstrated as an efficient way for promoting photo-induced carrier separation based on p–n heterojunctions,16 Schottky heterojuctions17 and band structure matching physical mechanisms.18
In recent years, nanostructured materials have attracted considerable attention for photocatalysis due to their unique physical and chemical properties compared to their bulk counterparts.19 These diverse nanostructures such as nanoparticles,20 nanoporous structures,21 nanospheres,22 nanobelts,23 nanorods,24 nanowires25 and other more complex structures26 have demonstrated extraordinary unconventional properties, which can greatly enrich the material selection and open a new degree of freedom for the design of effective photocatalytic systems.27 Meanwhile, the availability of a broad range of nanostructures can allow for flexible integration of multiple functional components to create heterogeneous structures with unique characteristics or unprecedented performance.28,29
Recently, TiO2-based material nanocomposites have attracted a great deal of research attention.30 And its main purposes are to broaden the absorption spectrum and to promote the separation of photocarriers using the heterostructures. The TiO2-based nanocomposites are mainly particulate, film-like and fibrous (or banded) structures.7 However, TiO2 nanoparticle composites are easy to from an unexpected formation (a core–shell structure) that blocks UV light absorption and restricts the diffusion of photoinduced charge carriers to the composite surface.31 Although the film-like composite can realize UV and visible light photocatalysis by adjusting the density of the secondary phase material, the film is a two dimensional (2D) structure, so the unit mass photocatalytic performance is very low. Recent studies show that TiO2 nanobelts have been studied extensively.32 In comparison with nanoparticles and films, TiO2 nanobelt composites display new properties and can improve the UV-visible photocatalytic performance.33 However, it is difficult to achieve mass preparation due to the complex synthesis method. TiO2 nanotube synthesis by an electrospinning method can overcome the problem.34 Furthermore, it is a polycrystalline nanotube consisting of nanoparticles, so it has a large active surface. More importantly, the mutual connection between these particles is conducive to photocarrier transport. At the same time, due to the nanotube structure, the catalytic active site is not limited to the surface of the nanotubes, it can also be realized in the tube cavity. Moreover, it is more appropriate to build a flexible photocatalytic system using the TiO2 nanotube.
Inspired by the correlation between shape/morphology and performance of the photocatalysts, we report the discovery of a novel photocatalyst of desired 3-D nanoarchitecture by assembling Sn3O4 nanosheets on N-doped TiO2 nanotubes. A hybrid nanostructured photocatalyst with enhanced broad spectrum photocatalytic properties has been constructed, which can harness UV and visible light to decompose organic contaminants in aqueous solutions and catalyse water splitting. An investigation of the material's photocatalytic abilities indicates that the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures exhibit an enhanced photocatalytic activity in the decomposition of MO and promote hydrogen evolution from water solution under UV and visible light irradiation. Furthermore, these Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures can be easily recycled without a decrease in the photocatalytic activity due to their 3D nanostructured nature. It is expected that the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures with high photocatalytic activities will greatly promote their practical application in eliminating organic pollutants from waste water and producing hydrogen.
Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1, all the diffraction peaks of the TiO2 (curve a) and the N-TiO2 (curve b) matched these of anatase (PDF-#21-1272)35 meanwhile those of Sn3O4 (curve c) matched those of PDF-#16-0737.15 Otherwise, besides TiO2, no other nitrogen-containing compounds or other titanic polymorphs were detected in the N-TiO2 nanotubes (curve b). Furthermore, there was no evident shift of the XRD peaks indexed to the anatase phase after nitrogen doping. Thus, it is inferred that the crystallinity of the anatase TiO2 doesn't decrease after nitrogen doping. For the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 (curve c) and the Sn3O4/TiO2 (Fig. S1†) hierarchical hybrid nanomaterials, all of the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to either N-TiO2 or Sn3O4, indicating that the nanomaterials are compounds of Sn3O4/N-TiO2.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of TiO2 nanotubes (curve a), N-TiO2 nanotubes (curve b), Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures (curve c); Sn3O4 nanosheets (curve d). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was employed to investigate the crystal phase of TiO2 nanotubes, N-TiO2 nanotubes, Sn3O4 nanosheets and Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures. 
The morphology of the as-prepared N-TiO2 nanotubes, Sn3O4 nanosheets, and Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The N-TiO2 shows good uniformity and a relatively smooth surface without secondary nanostructures from Fig. 2a. The diameter of the nanotubes range from 200 to 300 nm, and the length of the nanotubes range to several hundreds of microns. As shown in Fig. S2,† the morphology of the nanotubes shows no visible change after nitrogen doping compared to the TiO2 nanotubes. Fig. 2b shows an amplified image of the N-TiO2 nanotubes. We can clearly see the inner diameter is about 200 nm, and the wall thickness is about 20 nm. As shown in Fig. 2c, the low magnification SEM images indicate that the product of Sn3O4 consists of a wealth of 3-D flower-like microstructures with a diameter of 3–4 μm, while the high magnification image (Fig. 2d) shows that each flower is composed of a large quantity of nanopetals with smooth surface. Fig. 2e shows a typical SEM image of the as-synthesized Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures, where the N-TiO2 nanotubes are uniformly decorated with Sn3O4 nanosheets. The nanosheets are evenly distributed over the entire surface of each nanotube and are connected to each other, forming a network of relief features on the rough surface of each nanotube. From Fig. 2f, it is easy to observe that the Sn3O4 nanosheets are in fact very thin flakes with an average thickness of about 8 nm and an average edge length of about 100–150 nm.

Fig. 3a–c show the typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the N-TiO2 nanotubes, the Sn3O4 nanosheets and the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures. The Sn3O4 nanosheets have a narrow size distribution. They possess a size of around 50 nm, coinciding with the results from the SEM observations. As shown in Fig. 3d, the HRTEM image of the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hybrid nanostructures clearly displays two types of lattice fringes. One set of the lattice spacings is about 0.352 nm, corresponding to the [101] crystal orientation of anatase TiO2.36 Another set of the lattice spacings is about 0.329 nm, corresponding to the [111] crystal orientation of Sn3O4. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. S4d†) of a single nanosheet clearly demonstrates the high crystallinity of the nanosheet. The TEM image of the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hybrid nanostructure reveals that highly dense Sn3O4 nanosheets have grown on the primary N-TiO2 nanotubes, coinciding with the results from the SEM observation.

The chemical composition and valence state were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The full range of XPS spectra of Sn3O4/N-TiO2 are shown in Fig. S7.† It shows that the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures are in the range of 50–950 eV. And impurities even carbon residue were not observed in the spectra. As shown in Fig. 4a, the binding energies (BE) of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 are 458.3 and 464.1 eV respectively, which are ascribed to the Ti4+ oxidation state.37,38Fig. 4b shows the Sn 3d5/2 peak at 486.3 eV and Sn 3d3/2 peak at 494.8 eV from the Sn3O4 material.14 From Fig. 4c, O 1s can be seen and it will be useful in identifying the core levels. An additional peak for N-TiO2 appeared at about 531.3 eV, which is attributed to the presence of Ti–O–N bonds.39 The formation of oxidized Ti–N led to the appearance of Ti–O–N structures and this result coincides with the fact that the presence of oxidized nitrogen should appear at a higher binding energy (>−400 eV).40Fig. 4d shows the N 1s XPS spectra of the pristine and the N-doped TiO2 nanotubes. Only one N 1s peak at 407.5 eV is present in the spectra of the N-doped samples.41

Fig. 5 shows the photodegradation of MO under UV and visible light irradiation which was used to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the catalysts. In the experiments, pure TiO2 nanotubes, N-TiO2 nanotubes and pure Sn3O4 nanosheets were used as a photocatalytic reference to study the photocatalytic activity of the Sn3O4/N (5%)-TiO2 (mole ratio N-TiO2:Sn3O4 = 2:1) hierarchical nanostructures. Fig. S8† shows control experiments performed under different conditions: (1) UV or visible light irradiation but in the absence of the photocatalysts, and (2) in the presence of the photocatalysts but in the dark. The result of Fig. S8† indicates that no degradation effect is observed if there is no light in the photocatalyst contained system or if there is no photocatalyst in the experimental system under light irradiation. Fig. 5a shows the degradation curves of MO on the pure TiO2 nanotubes, N-TiO2 nanotubes, Sn3O4 nanosheets, Sn3O4/TiO2 and Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures under UV irradiation. Within 25 min, for the pure TiO2 nanotubes, about 30% of MO is degraded. For the N-TiO2, the degradation ratio is about 37%. For Sn3O4, it is only about 20%. Surprisingly, for the Sn3O4/TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures, about 90% of MO can be degraded. And for the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures, the photocatalytic performance is significantly improved and MO can be completely degraded within 25 min. As mentioned above, Sn3O4 is not a good UV active photocatalyst, the enhanced UV photocatalysis activity of Sn3O4/N-TiO2 nanotube composites should be attributed to the hybrid nanostructures of Sn3O4 and N-TiO2. Under visible light irradiation (Fig. 5b), the TiO2 nanotubes and the N-TiO2 nanotubes had no photocatalytic activity within 80 min, except for the good adsorption of MO. Meanwhile, the Sn3O4 nanosheets exhibited negligible photocatalytic activity and the photodegradation efficiency of MO just reached about 22% after 80 min of reaction. In comparison, 76% of MO is photocatalytically degraded by Sn3O4/TiO2 and 95% of MO is photocatalytically degraded by Sn3O4/N-TiO2. Comparison of the photocatalytic activities of the Sn3O4/TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures at different mole ratios of TiO2 and Sn3O4 and at different content of N under either (a) visible or (b) UV light irradiation are shown in the Fig. S9 and S10.†

And photocatalytic degradation of MO by the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructure in repeated experiments under (c) visible and (d) UV light irradiation. 
To examine the photocatalytic stability of the catalysts, the efficiency of the MO photodegradation was evaluated in a repetitive mode using the same photocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 5c and d, the MO dye was quickly decomposed after every injection of the MO solution and the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 nanotube hybrid nanostructures are stable under repeated experiments with a nearly constant photodecomposition rate. Thus, the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 nanotube hybrid nanostructures are an effective and stable photocatalyst under UV and visible light irradiation.
To further demonstrate the enhanced photocatalytic property of the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures, the evolution of hydrogen was measured according to the photocatalytic water-splitting process. As shown in Fig. 6, the amount of hydrogen increases linearly with the irradiation time over 6 h for TiO2 nanotubes, N-TiO2 nanotubes, Sn3O4 nanosheets, Sn3O4/TiO2 and Sn3O4/N (5%)-TiO2 (mole ratio N-TiO2:Sn3O4 = 3:1) hierarchical hybrid nanostructures. The hydrogen generation rate of the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures is about 32 μmol h−1 g−1, while the hydrogen generation rate of the Sn3O4/TiO2 and N-TiO2 nanotubes is about 19 μmol h−1 g−1 and 5.5 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively. Neither the TiO2 nor the Sn3O4 materials exhibited obvious H2 evolution. These results indicate that the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures have the highest photocatalytic activity among these materials. Photocatalytic H2 evolution from an aqueous methanol solution for the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures at different ratios are shown in the Fig. S11.† More importantly, after four cycles of 6 h reaction, the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures still retained high photocatalytic activity, which demonstrates their stability (Fig. 6b).

Fig. 7a shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of TiO2 nanotubes, N-TiO2 nanotubes, Sn3O4 nanosheets, Sn3O4/TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures, and Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures. The UV-vis spectra of TiO2 can be used to explain the enhancement of the photocatalytic properties of the hybrid nanostructure under visible light. The spectrum of TiO2 nanotubes exhibited the typical absorption behaviour of a wide-band-gap oxide semiconductor, which has an intense absorption band with a steep edge at about 380 nm (the band gap is about 3.26 eV). The N-TiO2 have an absorption band edge at about 400 nm (the band gap is about 2.97 eV). The band gap of the pure Sn3O4 nanosheets was calculated to be about 2.38 eV. The band gap of the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hybrid nanostructures ranges from 2.69 eV to 2.48 eV and decreases as the molar ratio of N-TiO2:Sn3O4 increases from 4:1 to 1:1 (see Fig. S13†). The red shift of the absorption band edge should lead to a better photocatalytic efficiency, especially under visible-light irradiation.42 It was observed that the pale yellow product exhibited strong absorption in the UV range and had little absorbance in the visible range.

(b) Photocurrent response for N-TiO2 nanotubes, Sn3O4 nanosheets and Sn3O4/N-TiO2 under 0.1 V bias. 
To further explain the enhancement of the photocatalytic property of the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructured catalyst, the photoelectrochemical performance of TiO2 nanotubes, N-TiO2 nanotubes, Sn3O4 nanosheets and Sn3O4/N-TiO2 were measured under 0.1 V bias. Fig. 7b shows the I–t measurements to examine the photoresponse of the samples over cycles of light on-off under 0.1 V bias. When the irradiation was interrupted, the photocurrent rapidly dropped to almost zero (steady-state value), and the photocurrent reverted to its original value once the light was switched on again.43 The photocurrent of the TiO2 nanotube and the N-TiO2 nanotube anode is about 2 μA cm−2 and 2.15 μA cm−2, the photocurrent of the Sn3O4 nanosheet anode is about 0.3 μA cm−2, while the photocurrent of the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructured anode approaches 6.3 μA cm−2, which is almost 3 times that of the N-TiO2 nanotube anode. The significant photocurrent enhancement was ascribed to the improved charge separation of the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 heterojunction structure.
Based on the above results, the photoelectrochemical water splitting mechanism is proposed in Scheme 1. When Sn3O4 contacts N-TiO2 cores to form a heterojunction, the band structure of Sn3O4/N-TiO2 shells is reconfigured. The energy bands of the N-TiO2 and Sn3O4 shift upward and downward along with the diffusion of carriers until the Fermi levels of N-TiO2 and Sn3O4 reach equilibrium. Under light irradiation, photogenerated holes and electrons appear in the valence bands (VB) and conduction bands (CB) of N-TiO2 and Sn3O4, respectively. Due to the band position of N-TiO2 and Sn3O4, the photogenerated electrons in the Sn3O4 CB were easily injected into the TiO2 CB, meanwhile the photogenerated holes in the TiO2 VB were injected into the Sn3O4 VB. In addition, the morphology of Sn3O4/N-TiO2 seems to be a special Junes system, the photogenerated holes in the N-TiO2, the minority carrier, had a very short migration distance to Sn3O4 due to the thin N-TiO2 nanotube wall (20 nm) as mentioned before. So, photogenerated electrons have a very small chance to recombine with the holes. Furthermore, the inner surface of N-TiO2 is an open tube, so electrons can be consumed to achieve a chemical reduction reaction for H2 evolution at these sites. Meanwhile, from the thin N-TiO2 nanotube wall also arises a short migration distance for electrons. Therefore, the electrons in the TiO2 CB which not only came from the TiO2 UV irradiation, but also Sn3O4 injection, have a high chance to contribute to the reduction reaction. In one word, for our hybrid photocatalyst, the photogenerated electron–hole pairs are effectively separated, under the synergistic effects between band structures and morphology, which is crucial for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. We believe that the combined effects of the introduction of N and the formation of the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 heterojunction contribute to the enhancement in the efficiency of photocatalytic activity.

Experimental
Materials
All the reagents in this work are analytical grade and commercially available. Tetrabutyl titanate (Ti(OC4H9)4), tin(II) chloride dehydrate (SnCl2·2H2O), NaOH, acetic acid, acetylacetone, trisodium citrate dehydrate, methyl orange and urea were purchased from China National Medicines Corporation Ltd, and the polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 1300000) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Synthesis

Preparation of N-doped TiO2 nanotubes. 
Firstly, 1.05 g polyvinylpyrrolidone powder (PVP, Mw = 1300000) was added to a mixture of 6.0 g absolute ethanol and 19 g acetic acid in a capped bottle. The obtained solution was stirred for 1 h to generate a homogeneous solution. Then 14.85 g Ti(OC4H9)4 and 3.0 g acetyl acetone were added to the solution, and the mixture was continuously stirred for another 1 h to make a precursor solution. 12.5 g mechanical pump oil was added to the solution, and the mixture was continuously stirred for 12 h. Then 1 mL of the solution was placed in a 5 mL syringe equipped with a blunt metal needle of 0.8 mm diameter. A stainless steel plate covered with a sheet of aluminium foil was employed as the collector. The distance between the needle tip and collector was 25 cm, and the voltage was set at 22 kV. The as-collected nanotubes were calcined at 500 °C for 2 h to form anatase TiO2 nanotubes. The detailed experimental conditions for the fabrication of N5%, N10%, N15%, and N20% are listed in Table S1.†


Fabrication of Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures. 
In a typical experiment, 0.016 g N-TiO2 nanotubes, 0.27 g SnCl2·2H2O and 0.882 g Na3C6H5O7·2H2O were dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water under magnetic stirring, respectively. The solution was adjusted to pH = 5.5 with NaOH. Then the resulted clear solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was heated to 180 °C and maintained for 12 h. Then, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature. The obtained composite nanotubes were washed with deionized water and ethanol to remove any ionic residue, then dried in an oven at 80 °C for 4 h. The as-fabricated sample was denoted as Sn3O4/N-TiO2. By tuning the precursor concentration for synthesizing Sn3O4, three other samples of Sn3O4/N-TiO2 were fabricated. And Sn3O4 was synthesized in the absence of TiO2 nanotube. The detailed experimental conditions for the fabrication of 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 and 4:1 are listed in Table S1.†

Material characterization
XRD patterns of the samples were recorded by an X-ray diffraction spectrometer with Cu Kα radiation (D8-advance, Bruker AXS, Germany).
The morphology and microstructure of the samples were examined by SEM-a HITACHI S-8020 microscopy. The composition of N-TiO2 was analysed by an energy-dispersion spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford link system) analyser, which was equipped to the SEM.
The TEM images were acquired on a JEOL JEM 2100 microscope with an operating voltage of 200 kV. The sample for TEM was prepared by dropping a methanol suspension of the sample powder onto a copper microgrid. The sample was thoroughly dried in vacuum prior to observation.

Photocatalytic test. 
The photocatalytic activity of Sn3O4/TiO2 was assessed by the photodegradation of MO using photochemical reaction apparatus. In a typical experiment, 20 mL aqueous suspensions of MO (20 mg L−1) and 40 mg of sample were placed in a 50 mL beaker. Prior to irradiation, the suspensions were magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 min to establish adsorption/desorption equilibrium between the dye and the surface of the catalyst at room temperature. A 300 W mercury lamp with a maximum emission of 356 nm was used as the UV light source and a 350 W Xe lamp with a cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm) was used as the visible light source. For comparison, photodegradation abilities of 40 mg TiO2 nanotubes and 40 mg Sn3O4 nanosheets were evaluated under the same experimental conditions. At varied irradiation time intervals, the residual MO concentration in the supernatant was analyzed by UV-vis spectroscopic measurement (Shimadzu UV-3600). Four consecutive cycles were tested. The samples were washed thoroughly with water and dried after each cycle.
UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the samples were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu) with an integrating sphere attachment within the range of 200 to 800 nm and with BaSO4 as the reflectance standard.
The H2 evolution experiments were carried out in a gas-closed circulation system. In a typical reaction, 100 mg of the catalyst powder was dispersed in CH3OH aqueous solution using a magnetic stirrer (80 mL of distilled water + 20 mL of CH3OH). A commercial solar simulator (300 W) equipped with a xenon lamp was used as the light source for photocatalytic H2 generation. The power density of the incident light was about 100 mW cm−2. The H2 evolution was measured with an on-line gas chromatograph (GC-7900).


Photoelectrode fabrication. 
50 mg of photocatalyst sample was mixed with 20 mL of terpineol and stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 10 h. The suspension was dip-coated onto the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate. A doctor blading technique was employed to ensure the same thickness for each photoelectrode. The photoelectrode was dried on a hot plate at 80 °C, and then heated in a quartz tubular furnace in Ar at 200 °C for 2 h. Digital pictures of the N-TiO2, Sn3O4, Sn3O4/N-TiO2 anode are shown in Fig. S9.† A Cu wire was connected to the FTO substrate with the silver colloid paste. Finally, epoxy was solidified to cover the FTO substrate, the silver paste and the Cu wire to avoid short current in the measurement.


Photoelectrochemical measurement. 
Photoelectrochemical analyses were carried out using a standard three-electrode cell with Ag/AgCl as reference electrode and Pt sheet as the counter electrode in the KCl solution (1 M). The electrolyte was bubbled with N2 for 2 h to remove O2. The light source used was identical with that used in the photocatalytic H2 generation testing.



In situ XPS analysis. 
In the present work, visible light irradiation was carried out in the XPS preparation chamber, and the sample was then transferred to the XPS analysis chamber without being exposed to the air. This “in situ” setting makes it possible to eliminate the influence of environmental pollution, thereby permitting the detection of the intrinsic surface reaction under visible light irradiation. A mercury–xenon lamp (LC8, HAMAMATSU, 200 W, Japan) with 420 and 800 nm cutoff filters was used as an excitation light source, and was introduced into the XPS preparation chamber though a sapphire window. Prior to the illumination of the sample, CH3OH was adsorbed onto the surface of the sample by vacuum drying of the suspension. After the irradiation in the XPS preparation chamber, the photoinduced holes were quenched by the photocatalytic oxidation of CH3OH, whereas photoexcited electrons remained in Sn3O4. Thus, the differential spectrum between before and after irradiation was attributed to the electrons in Sn3O4.

Conclusions
In summary, to the best of our knowledge, the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures with novel architecture were successfully fabricated for the first time using the solvothermal process and electrospinning technology. Compared to the pure TiO2 nanotubes, Sn3O4 nanosheets, N-TiO2 nanotubes and Sn3O4/TiO2, the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructures exhibited a high photocatalytic performance for the decomposition of MO and water splitting. These results indicated that the Sn3O4/N-TiO2 hierarchical hybrid nanostructure is a promising candidate material for wastewater treatment and hydrogen evolution.
