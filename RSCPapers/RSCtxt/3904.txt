    , Accepted 5th October 2020First published on 6th October 2020AbstractIn the past 30 years, researchers have worked towards reducing the size of ordinary three-dimensional (3D) materials into 1D or 2D materials in order to obtain new properties and applications of these low-dimensional systems. Among them, functional nanofibers with large surface area and high porosity have been widely studied and paid attention to. Because of the interesting properties of nanofibers, they find extensive application in filtration, wound dressings, composites, sensors, capacitors, nanogenerators, etc. Recently, a variety of nanofiber preparation methods such as melt blowing, electrospinning (e-spinning), centrifugal spinning and solution blow spinning (SBS) have been proposed. This paper includes a brief review of the fundamental principles of the preparation of nanofibers for solution jet spinning, the influence of experimental parameters, and the properties and potential applications of the solution-blown fibers. And the industrialization and challenges of SBS are also included.
1. Introduction
In recent years, nanomaterials with new properties have been widely studied in the fields of the environment, energy,1–3 medicine,4,5etc.,6–11 and nanomembranes, nanospheres, nanotubes, and nanofibers have received extensive attention. Among the 1D nanostructures, nanofibers are most thoroughly studied. Methods for preparing nanofibers, such as electrospinning (e-spinning),4 centrifugal spinning,12,13 self-assembly techniques, template synthesis, near-field e-spinning14 and solution blow spinning (SBS),15,16 are well-studied. Table 1 shows the advantages and disadvantages of several spinning methods.

Although the nanofibers prepared by e-spinning technology have been widely used in biomedicine, energy, the environment, catalysis, etc., due to the high-voltage static electricity used in the preparation of nanofiber membranes, safety and equipment process problems are likely to occur. Secondly, the e-spinning technique also requires a certain conductivity of the polymer solution, which limits the spinnability of many non-conductive polymers. At the same time, the most important point is that nanofibers prepared by e-spinning have a low yield and it is difficult to achieve the mass production of nanofibers, thus greatly hindering their industrial scale production. In order to solve various technical problems occurring in the preparation process and improve the yield of nanofibers, centrifugal spinning and solution jet spinning have been proposed to realize the production of nanofibers to overcome the safety problems in the e-spinning process.
SBS is a new nanofiber preparation technology, which originated from the combination of e-spinning and traditional melt blowing technology. Compared with the e-spinning technology, SBS has a high yield, short preparation time and high usage value. Secondly, relatively more polymers and spinning solutions are suitable for SBS. Conductivity is not required, which expands the application range of the polymer solution; in addition, high-voltage electrostatic field support is not required in the solution spinning process, so that the safety is relatively higher, and the device requirement is lower. Compared with melt blowing technology, SBS has a richer source of raw materials and stronger material suitability. It is very suitable for some polymer raw materials which are soluble in non-toxic and volatile solutions but not suitable for melt blowing. In addition, since the process uses normal temperature compressed air, it can effectively prevent the thermal degradation of the polymer.24 Moreover, the SBS process, as a new spinning technology in recent years, has gradually become the focus of attention, and the current research studies are focused on its feasibility process,19,25,26 and fiber properties and applications,27–29 in which all aspects have been thoroughly studied. This paper summarizes the principles of SBS, influencing factors, application developments in various fields, current difficulties, etc.
2. Fundamental principles and research progress of SBS
The SBS technology was first proposed by Medeiros15 in 2009. Polylactic acid (PLA) and polystyrene (PS) nanofibers were successfully prepared by the blow spinning technology, and the influence of the blown fiber morphology was studied. Various factors laid the foundation for the development of the solution spinning technology. Zhang24 found that other conventional melt-blown devices could be used as prototypes to simplify and improve them. The polymer solution was used instead of the melt for spinning, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) microfibers were successfully prepared using a similar device. It has been proved that the solution blow spinning method can be used as a new method for preparing ultrafine fibers. After that, Shi30 and Zhuang31 successfully prepared polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofiber membranes with an average diameter of only 300 nm by solution spinning, and the performance was proved to be good. In addition, nanofibers such as chitosan (CS),32 nylon 633 and SiC34 were successfully prepared by solution blow spinning. The speed of solution spinning is faster than that of e-spinning, and the electrical parameters of polymer solution are much less limited. SBS has been used in various applications such as sensors,35 filtration31 and biomedical applications.36,37
2.1 Physical mechanisms of SBS
The main theoretical basis for solution blowing nanofibers is the high-speed stretching principle of airflow and the Bernoulli principle. The working diagram is shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 4b, when the high-pressure gas stream P1 leaves the outer nozzle, the pressure drops to Patm, at which time the jet flow energy increases and the gas velocity increases, which in turn promotes a drop in the pressure P2 at the center of the jet, forming a driving force to accelerate polymer solution. The formation process of the solution jet is shown in Fig. 1c. The high velocity gas flow also causes shearing force at the gas/solution interface, thereby deforming the polymer solution from a droplet to a conical shape. When this shearing force overcomes the surface tension of the polymer solution, a solution jet is generated. During the flying (Fig. 1d), the solvent rapidly evaporates and polymer fibers finally deposit on the collector.15

(c) The formation process of a solution jet. Reproduced with permission from ref. 15. (d) Motion image of the solution jet. Reproduced with permission from ref. 39. 
Between the tips of the nozzle and the collector, the jet has two transient forms: a straight shape and a disturbed curved shape (as shown in Fig. 2). At the tip of the needle, the cross section of the solution jet is relatively large and resists the effects of bending. This can be explained by Newton's method and non-Newton's method. Sinha-Ray et al. studied the physical mechanism of solution jet spinning to prepare nanofibers under the assumption of isothermal conditions. Eqn (1) gives the mass reduction of the unit length of the linear part:40 (1)where x represents the axial coordinate of the solution jet, f represents the size of the cross section (assumed to be circular), and a is the radius. V represents the jet velocity, hm is the mass transfer coefficient, and Cs,eq(T) and Cs,∞ are the solvent vapor volume fractions at the jet surface and far away, respectively.41hm can be expressed by the following formula: (2)Da is the diffusion coefficient of solvent vapor in the air. Re = V2a/va is the Reynolds number, Sc = va/Da is the Schmidt number, and va is the kinematic viscosity of the air. The momentum balance that maintains a straight jet is represented by eqn (3), (3)where ρ is the polymer solution density, σxx is the longitudinal stress of the solution jet, and qτ is the aerodynamic drag in the x axis direction that pulls the solution jet; the expression is as follows: (4)
 Fig. 2  Image of the liquid jet. Reproduced with permission from ref. 40. 
In this expression, c represents the empirical constant, ρa represents the air density, and Ua represents the absolute velocity of air in the x-axis direction.
Daristotle et al.42,43 believed that the ability of polymer solution to form fibers mainly depends on the influence of polymer molecular chains. The overlap concentration (c*) is the critical point when polymer molecular chains start to overlap, causing entanglements. When the overlap concentration reaches a certain value, the polymer solution becomes semidilute, and the interaction between the entangled polymer chains causes the viscosity to increase. c* is expressed as follows: c* = 63/2Mw/(8Na〈R2〉3/2)(5)
〈R2〉 is the approximate value of the mean-square end-to-end distance of the polymer, expressed as: 〈R2〉 = α2C∞(2Mw/M0)l2(6)α is the Flory temperature expansion coefficient, C∞ is the characteristic ratio, l is the bond length, Mw is the weight average molecular weight of the polymer, and Na is Avogadro's number.
2.2 Factors influencing the SBS process
So far, researchers have tried several times to confirm the parameters that control SBS. The attenuation of the polymer solution jet is affected by unstable bending, whipping, stretching and the solvent evaporation rate.44 The type and concentration of the polymer also affect the fiber morphology. In addition, the gas flow velocity, the polymer solution injection rate, the receiving distance, and the protruding distance of the inner needle are also important factors of the technology. Table 2 summarizes some of the major elements affecting the fiber formation when using solution blow spinning technology. The effects of the concentration of the polymer solution, the polymer solution injection rate, and the size of the nozzle on the morphology and diameter of the fiber are similar to the influence of the gas pressure, as shown in Fig. 3, Axisymmetric velocity field in the air spinning that simulates a state dimensionless.40

2.3 SBS device development and modification
In 2009, Medeiros et al.15 proposed SBS for the first time. The device is shown in Fig. 4a. Afterwards, researchers made some improvements to the SBS device, such as the air source, collection device, and coaxial nozzle. The blow spinning machines used in the laboratory mainly include cylinders (providing high-speed gas), pressure regulators, injectors, propulsion pumps, coaxial nozzles and collectors. As shown in Fig. 1a and b, the collecting pole can be a roller or a mesh gauze that controls the speed. The high velocity gas is ejected from the outer shaft of the nozzle and the polymer solution is extruded from the inner shaft. Fig. 4b shows a schematic diagram of the coaxial nozzle,15Fig. 4c shows a simplified schematic diagram of the solution jet spinning device used in the laboratory.25 Recently, the use of commercial spray guns for SBS has been reported (Fig. 4d). Although this method is simple and convenient, its disadvantages are also obvious. The main problem is the uncontrollable feeding rate of the polymer solution which will affect the fiber morphology. In addition, as shown in Fig. 4e, Gao et al.39 designed a portable SBS device. Just like the development history of computers, the development trends of SBS devices will also be towards miniaturization and portability. At present, the biggest challenge of the portable SBS device is to develop a small-volume air pump that can work for a long time and provide at least 0.3 MPa high-pressure gas.

As a new spinning technology for manufacturing nanofibers, solution spinning has many advantages over e-spinning, even though there are still some disadvantages, such as uneven distribution and easy folding of fibers and filaments. In response to these problems, the researchers further improved the jet spinning device by introducing an electrostatic field into the solution spinning device, allowing the blown polymer solution jet to be charged, thereby making the fibers more refined on the basis of the original blow spinning. The resulting nanofibers are more uniform (referred to as electro-blown spinning technology, “EBS”), as shown in Fig. 5a, which shows a schematic diagram of the EBS device for the laboratory.45 The device component is added with a power supply system (high-voltage power supply) on the original spinning device. The high-voltage power supply is grounded at one end and connected at another end. Stainless steel nozzles provide an electrostatic field. The air flow during spinning is controlled by a flow valve. And the solution is blown through a high velocity gas stream and electrostatic stretching to obtain nanofibers on the collector after solidification of the polymer and evaporation of the solvent. The process of introducing the electrostatic field into the solution spinning can effectively enhance the traction and stretching effects on the solution jet, which optimize the fiber distribution effect, and have lower voltage requirements at the same time, resulting in higher safety and operability. Shi et al.46 carried out some research on the comparison between SBS and electro-blown spinning (EBS). First, PTFE/PVA/BA composite fibers were prepared, and then PTFE fibers were obtained after calcination. The SEM images and diameter distribution of the fibers are shown in Fig. 5b1–c3. They clearly show that the fibers prepared by EBS are finer and more uniform.

If nanofibers with a core–shell structure are prepared, the improvement of the spinning device as shown in Fig. 6a can be made. The TEM images of PVP/PCL core–shell fibers and nylon 6-chitosan core–shell fibers are shown in Fig. 6b and c. In addition, an electro-blown core–shell fiber device25 and an electrostatic induction-assisted SBS device47–50 are shown in Fig. 6d and e. Both the electro-blown spinning and electrostatic induction-assisted SBS add electric field force in the SBS process. Due to the synergistic effect of the airflow force and electric field force for stretching and splitting the solution jet, finer and more uniform fibers are finally obtained.

3. Applications
The advantages of SBS technology are a high yield, a short preparation time and a high practical value; solution blowing is not restricted by static electricity and the solution dielectric constant, and it is suitable for voltage sensitive polymers. Fibrous nonwovens have high porosity and good gas permeability. Moreover, it is possible to mass-produce nanofibers and realize large-scale industrial production. As a new spinning technology in recent years, the SBS process has gradually received more attention. Recently, solution blow spinning has been widely used in biomedicine, filtration, battery separator materials, electrode materials, sensors, and catalysis.
3.1 Biomedical materials
Nano- and micro-fibers prepared by solution blow spinning have been widely applied to biomedical fields, such as wound dressing,88 tissue engineering,89 immobilized enzymes90 and artificial blood vessels.91 Biodegradable polymers such as polylactic acid (PLA) have been applied to drug delivery, bone remodeling and tissue engineering by converting them into PLA nanofibers. The effect of solution-blown polylactic acid nanofibers on the adhesion and proliferation of vascular prosthesis surface endothelial cells was also studied.92 In another study, solution blown polylactic acid (PLA) nanofibers and PLA nanofibers containing hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and tetracycline hydrochloride (THC) were achieved using two solvents – acetone/chloroform and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE).77 Antimicrobial tests on E. coli and M. monocytogenes using diffusion methods got similar results for both microorganisms, demonstrating the positive antibacterial performance of HPMC samples. In terms of drug release, Souza et al.76 produced poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) nanofibers by e-spinning and solution spinning, and they also did research on encapsulation. The release characteristics of diclofenac sodium in PHBV nanofibers determined the effect of the drug on their fiber morphology and structural properties. Studies have shown that both the e-spinning and solution blow spinning PHBV membranes can effectively encapsulate diclofenac sodium. In addition, PLGA is widely used in biomedical fields due to its good biocompatibility and biodegradability. Behrens et al.36 produced PLGA nanofibers by solution spinning and applied them to multiple surgical models of piglets, including lung resection, intestinal anastomosis, superficial liver injury and paralysis.
Recently, the solution blow spinning technology has also been applied to artificial blood vessels. Akentjew et al.93 combined SBS and dip spinning to produce small diameter vascular grafts (SDVG). As shown in Fig. 7a and b, poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) fibers were deposited on the rotating collecting rod at specified angles. Then the rotating collection rod was controlled to move up and down. When the rotating collection rod moves down, it will dip in the gelatin-alginate (GEAL) solution and be coated with a humid GEAL layer. After crosslinking treatments by ultraviolet light, a uniform GEAL layer will be obtained. Small diameter vascular grafts obtained by this method have excellent clinical potential.

(e) Cross-sectional image of the SDVG. (f) Evidence of eco-Doppler blood flow. Reproduced with permission from ref. 93. 
Visceral hemostasis has always been one of the medical challenges. Daristotle et al.94 proposed a surgical sealant with low toxicity, and high burst pressure and adhesion. The precursor solution contains 10% w/v PLGA, 5% w/v PEG, and 5% w/v 620 nm silica particles (the solvent is acetone). Polymer fibers were deposited on the incision of the pig liver using a solution blow spinning device, and the experimental results proved that the hemostatic effect was quite good. Gao et al.39 applied solution blow spinning technology to minimally invasive surgery hemostasis. The operation space of minimally invasive surgery is narrow, so the high voltage electricity required for electrospinning poses a great threat to the human body and medical equipment. To solve this problem, Gao et al. designed a portable solution blow spinning device, which has a good spinning effect. Then the device and minimally invasive surgery were combined to carry out the hemostasis experiment of the pig liver (the hemostatic material is medical glue). The experimental results are shown in Fig. 8a–e. In addition, the hemostasis experiment of pig spine operation was carried out, and the experimental pictures are shown in Fig. 8f–i. This work proves that solution blow spinning has good potential in minimally invasive surgery hemostasis and wound dressing. However, SBS has some disadvantages in visceral hemostasis, mainly for the following two points: (1) due to the existence of airflow, the adhesion between fibers and tissues is not enough; and (2) high velocity gas flow may cause secondary damage to some soft tissues.

3.2 Energy materials
Solution-blown nanofibers are used in energy materials, such as electrode materials for fuel cells and supercapacitors. Deng et al.95 studied the preparation of a PCNF-CNT-S composite and used it in the cathode of lithium–sulfur batteries. The customized porous structure and CNTs in the composite help in building highly conductive pathways and storing more S/polysulfide. Besides, it also inhibits the solubility loss of intermediate S species in electrolytes due to acidified PVA-based porous carbon nanofibers. At the same time, the porous structure and CNTs can effectively reduce the volume change during battery cycling. The obtained PCNF-CNT-S cathode exhibits excellent performance in a Li–S battery, has a high initial discharge capacity of up to 1302.9 mA h g−1 and has an extremely stable capacity (809.1 mA h g−1) after 300 cycles. Jia et al.96 used a pair of parallel rods as the collector of a solution blow spinning device, which is based on the precursor polymer PAN, and finally obtained ordered carbon nanofiber (CNF) yarns. The prepared nanofibers are carbonized to reduce their diameter and applied to supercapacitor electrodes. They have good stability and large capacitance (70 F g−1), which is significantly larger than that of the electrospun disordered carbon nanofiber electrodes (60 F g−1). Shi et al.30 obtained ZnO nanoflake-encapsulating carbon nanofibers (Fig. 9a) for electrode materials of supercapacitors based on solution blow spinning. The charge–discharge curves of electrode materials with different ZnO contents are shown in Fig. 9b. The electrode (ZnO/CNF-2) has a high specific capacitance of 216.3 F g−1 and exhibits excellent cycle performance (Fig. 9c) with only 5.41% loss of capacitance. In addition, carbon nanofibers (CNFs) spun from PAN solution have also been reported as electrodes for microbial fuel cells. The current density of the CNFs is 17 A m−2, and the current density increases to 21 A m−2 with the addition of carbon black.28 Liu et al.16 prepared PVDF nanofiber membranes by solution blow spinning. The traction stretching of the gas flow can promote the transformation of the α phase to the β phase of PVDF. Therefore, the piezoelectric effect of the PVDF nanofiber film is studied and a simple nano-generator device is prepared. The mechanical deformation of the device can generate electric current, and supply energy for tiny electronic devices, and the movement of the joints of the body can also generate electric current.

Wang et al.97 studied the introduction of a hot pressing process in the preparation of proton exchange membranes due to the relatively high porosity of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and sulfonated polyethersulfone (SPES) nanofibers prepared by solution spinning. Therefore, they were fabricated into a composite proton exchange membrane with a transmembrane transport channel, and a series of research tests were performed. The results show that the SPES/PVDF composite proton exchange membrane has excellent performance in blocking dyes. Xu et al.47 synthesized composite membranes of sulfonated poly(ether sulfone) and cellulose nanofibers. It was found that the composite membrane showed the highest proton conductivity (0.13 S cm−1, 80 °C) when the mass fraction of cellulose nanofibers was 5 wt%. Recently, Zhao et al.98 obtained cellulose nanofibers by solution blow spinning and hydrolysis. Then, the cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) were modified with FAAs (Cell-FAAs) and the Fmoc-protecting groups were removed to obtain amino acid clusters supported by the cellulose nanofibers (Cell-AA NFs: Cell-Gly, Cell-Val, Cell-Ser, Cell-Asp and Cell-Leu). Subsequently, the amino acid clusters supported by the cellulose nanofibers (Cell-AA NFs) were impregnated into sulfonated polysulfone (SPSF) solution and dried to finally obtain several different proton exchange membranes (hybrid PEMs: SPSF-Gly, SPSF-Val, SPSF-Leu, SPSF-Asp and SPSF-Ser). It can be seen from Fig. 10b and c that the SPSF-Ser 20 (20 wt% Cell-Ser NFs) proton exchange membrane has the best proton conductivity (0.264 S cm−1), far exceeding that of the Nafion membrane. Fig. 10d shows a direct methanol fuel cell test. It shows that SPSF-Ser has the best power density (87.22 mW cm−2). In addition, Wang et al.99 solution blow spun γ-poly(glutamic acid) (γ-PGA)/polylactic acid (PLA) composite nanofiber mats. The composite nanofiber mat was then impregnated into sulfonated poly(ether sulfone) solution. After drying and hot pressing, a proton exchange membrane (PEM) was obtained. As shown in Fig. 10f–h, SPES-30 (30 wt% γ-PGA/PLA composite nanofibers) has the highest proton conductivity (0.261 S cm−1) and the highest power density (202.3 mW cm−2), showing excellent battery performance.

Extracting uranium from seawater is considered to be an effective means to alleviate energy problems. Although there are abundant seawater resources on earth, the uranium concentration in seawater is very low. To extract and collect uranium from seawater, current researches mainly focus on efficient adsorbents. As shown in Fig. 11a, Li et al.68 prepared composite nanofibers containing amidoximated polyacrylonitrile (AOP) and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether-b-poly(L-arginine) (PPLA) by solution blow spinning (AOP 18 wt/v%, PPLA 15 wt/v%, the solvent is DMF). This composite nanofiber membrane exhibits good antibacterial properties and high uranium adsorption rates. In addition, Yuan et al.100 prepared montmorillonite–polyacrylamidoxime (MON-PAO) composite fibers (Fig. 11b) using solution blow spinning. Then the composite fibers were soaked in deionized water and shaken moderately for 24 h, and eventually a composite material (SMON-PAO, Fig. 11c) for uranium adsorption was obtained. After a series of tests, it was found that when the mass ratio of PAN to montmorillonite in the precursor solution was 1, the adsorption effect of the adsorbent was the best. Fig. 11d and e show that the adsorbent has good reusability and the ability to adsorb uranium and vanadium respectively.

3.3 Sensors
With the development of artificial intelligence, sensors have become the focus of scientific researchers. Miranda et al.101 prepared polystyrene nanofibrous (PSNF) mats doped with bromothymol blue (BTB) indicator by solution blow spinning, which can be used for pH testing of wine samples. Choi et al.102 made a humidity sensor based on PVDF nanofibers. And experiments show that doping ZnO and LiCl improve the performance of the humidity sensor. ZnO improves the response and recovery time of the sensor, and LiCl increases the sensitivity of the sensor. Among them, 4%LiCl-PVDF and 40%ZnO–3%LiCl-PVDF have the best sensor performance. Khattab et al.103 used solution blow spinning to achieve the doping of a novel tricyanofuran-hydrazone (TCF-H) pH-sensory disperse dye into PAN nanofibers. Based on these composite nanofibers, a solid colorimetric sensor for sensing pH changes was prepared. The sensor is suitable for alkali steam and water media, and it shows reversibility. In addition, Ho et al.104 proposed a composite fiber nonwoven fabric of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). As shown in Fig. 12b and c, they used this fabric to make a capacitive sensor and sensor array. Finally, four signals (Fig. 12e–h) were measured using the fabric as electrodes for biomedical devices. This work opens a new path for SBS technology in wearable electronics.

Wang et al.105 prepared several metal oxide nanofibers based on solution blow spinning: indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO), CuO, indium tin oxide (ITO), and Cu. Firstly, functional thin film transistors based on IGZO fibers were fabricated, a functional thin-film transistor array (Fig. 13c) was fabricated on a SiO2/Si substrate, and IGZO thin film transistors were used for NO2 gas sensors (Fig. 13d and e). Secondly, a stretchable IGZO resistor was fabricated on a SEBS substrate. The tensile strains and cycling tests are shown in Fig. 13g and h, and the experimental results prove the good stretchability of IGZO fibers. Finally, a wearable electronic skin was designed based on IGZO, ITO and CuO films. Fig. 13j shows the signals of the integrated sensor upon exposure to different stimuli. The relative current changes of the three resistors are shown in Fig. 13k. The flexible semiconductor and conductor materials proposed in this work will promote the development of wearable electronics.

3.4 Filtration materials
Solution-blown fibers have high porosity and are widely used in filtration. Shi et al.33 prepared nylon-6 3D crimped nanofibers by SBS technology and subjected them to a filtration test. The filtration efficiency can reach 93.5%. As shown in Fig. 14a, Bilal Khalid et al.63 prepared several polymer (PAN, PVP, PMMA, nylon-66) nanofibers as transparent air filtration membranes for indoor PM pollution protection, testing the optical transparency and PM removal efficiency of nanofiber membranes. Among them, PAN fiber membranes show excellent transmittance (80%), filtration efficiency (>99%) and pressure drop (Fig. 14b–d). In addition, when the air condition is good, the fiber membrane can be easily removed from the window screen, which is very convenient. Tao et al.106 prepared activated carbon nanofibers with diameters between 200 and 500 nm using PAN nanofibers as precursors. The adsorption amount of phenol was measured, the adsorption value was 119 to 251 mg g−1, and activated carbon nanofibers have high surface area (2921.263 m2 g−1) and pore volume (2.714 cm3 g−1). Mercante et al.62 prepared polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) porous nanofibers by SBS technology, coated them with graphene oxide, and then used them in the adsorption detection experiment of methylene blue; then the maximum methylene blue was determined experimentally. The amount of adsorption can reach 698.51 mg g−1. Ren et al.73 prepared a novel composite nanofiber mat by SBS and in situ polymerization through polyaniline coated polyacrylonitrile (PAN) material, and its hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) removal potential was studied. The experimental results show that the polyaniline/PAN composite fiber mat exhibits good adsorption performance for Cr(VI). In addition, factors affecting the removal rate of Cr(VI) in aqueous solution were systematically studied. The experimental data were fitted to various kinetic models and isothermal adsorption processes, and the thermodynamic parameters of the adsorption process were calculated. The experiment also proved that the polyaniline/PAN adsorbent has good recovery performance, and its adsorption and regeneration mechanism has been studied in detail.

PM is the main source of air pollution, and controlling from the source is an effective means. However, the temperature of exhaust gas is very high, so the research into high temperature resistant filtration materials is particularly important. As shown in Fig. 15a, Wang et al.107 obtained a high temperature resistant yttria-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) nanofiber sponge (Fig. 15b) by SBS and subsequent calcination. The filtration efficiencies of PM0.3–10 at different airflow velocities were measured with the filtration device shown in Fig. 15e. The filtration efficiency (>99.7%) is shown in Fig. 15f. Fig. 15g shows the automobile exhaust filtration efficiencies (>98%) of PM particles with different particle sizes. Such excellent filtration efficiencies and high temperature resistances prove that the YSZ sponge has good prospects in high temperature filtration.

Recently, Jia et al.108 reported a ZrO2 nanofiber membrane stabilized with Al2O3. The schematic of the SBS device and the photo of the fiber membrane are shown in Fig. 16a and b, respectively. The membrane has excellent high-temperature resistance, flexibility and filtration performance. NaCl particles were used to test the filtration performance of the fiber membrane, and the filtration performance was tested by changing the areal density of the fiber membrane and air flow velocity. As shown in Fig. 16e, the filtration efficiency of the fiber membrane with a density of 56 mg cm−2 under an airflow velocity of 5.4 cm s−1 is excellent. Fig. 16c and d show SEM images of the fibers before and after filtration. Fig. 16f shows the excellent filtration stability of the fiber membrane. The flexible high temperature resistant material proposed by this work will have good prospects in high temperature filtration. For SBS, the difficulty of high temperature filtration lies in the preparation of high temperature resistant flexible inorganic fibers. Firstly, it is necessary to develop a solution system with an excellent spinning effect. Secondly, the calcination temperature needs to be accurately controlled, especially for fiber membranes with porous structure; uneven heating will affect the performance of the material. Finally, it is necessary to improve the filtration performance, such as filtration efficiency, pressure drop, and filtration stability.

3.5 Other applications of functional materials
In addition to its application in the above fields, SBS also has broad prospects for application in catalysis, high temperature superconducting materials and thermal insulation materials. Rapid and large-scale production of mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers by solution blow spinning adds a suitable template (for example, Pluronic polymer) to alter the microstructure and porosity of the TiO2 nanofibers. Experiments have shown that blow-spun TiO2 nanofibers exhibit good performance in the photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline, and because of their large aspect ratio, they can be easily removed from aqueous tetracycline.109 In addition, using solution spinning to prepare high-temperature superconducting materials is of great significance in both energy conversion and electric power.
Cena et al.110 reported that solution-blown PVP/bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) precursor microfibers were heat-treated to synthesize BSCCO superconducting fibers, which showed typical resistance of superconducting materials in electrical measurements of the fibers. The temperature curve has opened up a new effective way for the preparation of high temperature superconducting materials. Ceramic fibers have good stability at high temperature. Wang et al.79 synthesized several ceramic fiber sponges (TiO2, ZrO2, YSZ and BaTiO3) based on SBS. These ceramic fiber sponges have extremely low density and good elastic recovery. Fig. 17b and c show an ultra-light and high temperature resistant TiO2 sponge. As shown in Fig. 17h, after 10 compression cycles at 400 °C, the Rt/Ro variation amplitude of the TiO2 sponge only slightly changed, indicating that the TiO2 sponge exhibits good high temperature stability and piezoresistive properties. Fig. 17i shows that the TiO2 sponge exhibits good photocatalytic properties. The stress–strain curves of the yttria-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) sponge compressed at 800 °C for 10 cycles are shown in Fig. 17g. The changes in the stress–strain curves are very small, so the YSZ sponge shows excellent resilience at high temperature. Fig. 17j shows the excellent heat insulation ability of the ZrO2 sponge. Table 4 summarizes functional materials obtained via SBS and their potential applications.

Recently, Jia et al.111 made some contributions to thermal insulation materials. As we all know, PVA/tetraethyl orthosilicate solution can yield SiO2 fibers through two processes of spinning and calcination. Jia et al. doped AlCl3 in the precursor solution and obtained a three-dimensional SiO2–Al2O3 sponge (Fig. 18b) with SBS and calcination. The presence of Al2O3 can improve the flexibility of the fibers so that the SiO2–Al2O3 sponge exhibits excellent elasticity (Fig. 18c and d). And because the sponge is a three-dimensional porous structure, the sponge is light in weight (Fig. 18b) and exhibits good thermal insulation properties (Fig. 18e and f). The use of SBS and combining with cage-like collectors to prepare a three-dimensional structured fiber network provides a good means for the preparation of three-dimensional nanomaterials and thermal insulation materials.

4. Industrialization and challenges
Different from e-spinning and melt blowing, SBS can produce nano- and micro-fibers on a large scale without a high-voltage electrostatic field and ultra high temperature. Due to the above advantages, SBS has developed rapidly since 2009. Actually, both e-spinning and melt-blown technology have been applied in industry to prepare fibers for air filtration such as medical surgical masks. Currently, SBS mainly remains in the laboratory experimental stage due to the short development time. However, some researchers tried to achieve the industrial production of solution blown nanofibers. Zhuang and Cheng from Tiangong University123,124 have designed several dies (Fig. 19a) for SBS and developed pilot-plant equipment (Fig. 19b). The diameters of the prepared nanofibers ranged from 150 nm to ∼350 nm, and the capacity of one production unit reached ∼100000 m2 per year. But in reality, there is still a long way to go for SBS, especially in the research of basic theory and material application, which needs to be improved and developed greatly. Since January 2020, melt-blown nonwovens and e-spun nanofibers have been playing a huge role in fighting against COVID-19. Why can’t SBS play a key role? It should be known that the filtration efficiency of a nanofiber mat prepared by electrostatic-induction-assisted SBS can also reach 99.923%.123 The key challenges of large scale application for solution blow spinning can be concluded as follows. (i) Immature technical equipment. A complete set of SBS equipment that can fully adapt to large-scale industrial production is still in the research stage. (ii) How to recover solvent? The mass production of fibers will result in a lot of solvent volatilization, which will increase production costs and damage to the environment. (iii) Though SBS has a richer source of raw materials and stronger material suitability, special raw materials for SBS may be necessary to ensure continuous and stable production. (iv) More product application development of solution blown nanofibers may further promote the development of SBS technology.

5. Conclusions
As a new technology for rapid and large-scale preparation of nanofibers, SBS has been developed rapidly in the past decade due to its advantages of large fiber surface area and suitability for a wide range of polymer solutions. And more and more researchers are working on their impact parameters and improving their equipment processes to improve and optimize the preparation of nanofibers. In this paper, the physical mechanisms of SBS technology and several improved SBS devices, influencing parameters and current solution-blown fibers and their applications in various fields are reviewed. Although SBS can greatly improve the yield of nanofibers and achieve industrial scale production relative to e-spinning, there are still many shortcomings, such as the morphological control of the spun fibers and the uniformity of distribution. Besides, the fiber diameter distribution and application of solution-blown materials need to be continuously improved. However, in general, the ease of operation of the SBS technology and the low equipment configuration have facilitated the research and development of new applications of nanofibers. In terms of fiber structure, solution-blown nanofibers have unique fiber morphology structures (such as 3D crimp and high porosity) that are distinct from e-spun nanofibers and rely on their structural advantages in medical, filtration, adsorption, and battery separator materials. At the same time, the SBS technology can also be transformed into a hand-held simple spinning device, which also has broad prospects for application in hand-held fast wound dressings. The solution jet spinning technology can achieve a spinning efficiency 10 times or more than the e-spinning technology, without the support of a high voltage electric field, low energy consumption, and simple device structure. In the mass production commercialization of nanofibers, the technology provides a new and promising technical route.
