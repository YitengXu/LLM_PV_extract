    , Accepted 19th May 2020First published on 19th May 2020AbstractThe photovoltaic (PV) response of SnOx/Si heterojunctions (HJs) through the change of the SnO and SnO2 ratio in the samples that allows us to obtain p- or n-type SnOx films is investigated in this work. The values of short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are found to be 12.6 mA cm−2, 0.23 V, 27% and 8.3%, for the p-SnOx/n-Si HJ and 10.3 mA cm−2, 0.20 V, 20% and 4.5% for the n-SnOx/p-Si HJ. The enhanced PV effect observed in the p-SnOx/n-Si HJs can be attributed to a small band offset between SnOx and Si, which lowers the diffusion length that can contribute to higher recombination rate and smaller series resistance. Furthermore, the values of Jsc, VOC, FF and PCE were enhanced up to 30.9 mA cm−2, −2.0 V, 19% and 10.9%, respectively, through the insertion of a 0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3-0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 (BCZT) ferroelectric layer between n-Si and p-SnOx. The built-in field developed at the Si/BCZT/SiOx/SnOx interfaces together with the depolarizing field, provides a favorable electric potential for the separation and further transport of photo generated electron–hole (e–h) pairs. This work provides a viable approach by combining ferroelectrics with p-SnOx/n-Si HJs for building efficient ferroelectric-based solar cells.
1. Introduction
Ferroelectric materials are being widely investigated for various device applications such as field-effect transistors (FETs), resistive random access memories (RRAMs), photovoltaic devices, etc.1–3 Despite their different applications and fundamental principles of operation, the interest in the use of ferroelectric materials is due to their spontaneous ferroelectric polarization that can be switched by an external electric field. Typically, by handling the inherent spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric materials it becomes possible to tune the energy band bending at the heterojunctions and the respective Schottky barrier profile, which is responsible for the enhancements of the ON/OFF ratio of FETs and resistive switching ratios of RRAM devices, as well as the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the photovoltaic effect (PV) in solar cells.1,3–5
Among the aforementioned devices, the application of ferroelectrics to photovoltaic (PV) devices is still at an early stage. However, the application of ferroelectrics as PV cells has unique features such as above-bandgap photovoltages, switchable photocurrents and a polarization controlled PV response.6,7 Due to these undoubtful merits, the ferroelectric PV effect is promising for a wide range of applications such as optoelectronic memories, solar cells, photo-sensors, etc.8
Several perovskite ferroelectric materials, such as BiFeO3 (BFO), Pb(Zr, Ti)O3 (PZT), BaTiO3 (BTO) and 0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3-0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 (BCZT) have been investigated for solar cells.6,9–12 Among them, BiFeO3 seems to be the most attractive for solar cells due to its narrow bandgap (Eg) of ∼2.7 eV, at room temperature.7 Furthermore, BFO exhibits a high saturation polarization of ∼90 μC cm−2, which is capable to induce a large above band gap open-circuit voltage and the spontaneous separation of e–h pairs.13
Moreover, different approaches are being employed to improve the PCE of BFO films, such as doping effect and interface engineering. In this context, Nechache et al. showed that a double perovskite oxide, Bi2FeCrO6, with a bandgap of ∼1.4 eV and a saturation polarization of ∼30 μC cm−2, exhibits an unprecedentedly high PCE of 8.1%, which is dependent on the Fe/Cr cationic order in the films.14 The narrowing of the ferroelectric's bandgap can definitely enhance the PCE. However, it also causes the degradation of the spontaneous polarization and an increase in the leakage current, which is detrimental for the device. Therefore, it is still a challenge to obtain an efficient ferroelectric solar cell.
On the other hand, cheap and eco-friendly solar cells, based on heterojunctions (HJs) between transition metal oxides (TMOs), such as ZnO and SnO2, and Si, were developed.15,16 In the case of SnO2/p-Si HJs, theoretical models predict an efficiency of 20%,17 while experimental reports have shown a lower efficiency of 6.3 and 4.9% for SnO2/n-Si and SnO2/p-Si HJs, respectively.16,18
A possible solution to enhance the PCE of the Si/SnO2 HJs lies in the integration of a ferroelectric interface layer within the stack. In this kind of structures, one can use the depolarizing field and the interface charge coupling between the ferroelectric and semiconductor layers for the separation and transport of the photo generated e–h pairs and thus enhancement of the PV effect. In this context, BCZT seems to be a promising solution since it exhibits a superior ferroelectric and piezoelectric performance, comparable to PZT, due to its morphotropic phase boundary (MPB).19 Thus, we have chosen BCZT as the ferroelectric layer.
Therefore, in the present work we first optimize the PV performance of the Si/SnOx HJs through the growth of p or n-type SnOx layers on appropriate p or n type-Si substrate in order to form a p–n junction. Then, the effect of the ferroelectric BCZT layer integration with the Si/SnOx HJs on their performance is investigated. The PV mechanism in a metal/silicon/insulator/ferroelectric/semiconductor/metal (MSIFSM) structure, particularly the origin of the PCE enhancement is proposed. The role of the polarization-dependent interfacial coupling effect on the separation of photoinduced charge carriers, through systematic measurements of the photovoltaic current–voltage curves at various polarization states is performed. Also the detailed analysis of energy band diagrams is given.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 depicts the XRD patterns of SnOx films with a thickness of 45 (blue curve) and 200 nm (red curve) deposited on n-type and p-type Si substrates respectively. Besides the presence of the Bragg reflection from the Si substrate at ∼55.5°, which corresponds to the (311) reflection, several peaks from the SnOx layers can be observed. The peaks located at 26.9°, 33.1°, 37.2°, 47.8°, 50.8°, 56.5° and 61.8°, correspond respectively to the (101), (110), (002), (200), (112), (211) and (202) reflections of the tetragonal – SnO phase (JCPDS card no. 55-0837). The peaks located at 33.3°, 54.7°, 57.7° and 61.3° can be indexed to the (101), (220), (002) and (310) reflections of the tetragonal rutile SnO2 structure (JCPDS card no. 41-1445). Diffraction peaks from metallic Sn are also observed at 30.7°, 32.1°, 45.0° only in the case of SnOx film deposited on p-Si substrate. The present results are in good agreement with the ones obtained in thinner and thicker SnOx films deposited on borosilicate glass substrates, as reported in our previous work.20

In order to explore the chemical composition and oxidation states in the tin oxide films, XPS measurements were performed. Fig. 2(a) and (c) display the typical core-level (CL) spectra assigned to Sn 3d for the thinner (45 nm) and thicker (200 nm) SnOx films, respectively, while the typical core-level spectra assigned to O 1s, are shown in Fig. 2(b) and (d), respectively. The chemical compositions and the oxidation states of Sn (i.e., Sn0, Sn2+ or Sn4+) were determined by fitting the Sn 3d5/2 core-level spectrum with Sn0, Sn2+, and Sn4+ components. The XPS spectra were analyzed using the Shirley-type function (i.e. non-linear background) and a sum of Voigt functions to the experimental results, using the KolXPD software.21 In the case of the 45 nm SnOx film, the Sn 3d5/2 contributes to the XPS spectrum with two peaks assigned to Sn2+ 3d5/2, at 486.2 ± 0.1 eV, and to Sn4+ 3d5/2, at 486.9 ± 0.1 eV, respectively. These peak positions are consistent with the reported values.22,23 In the case of the 200 nm SnOx films, an additional peak is observed, which can be assigned to a Sn metallic contribution, at 484.4 ± 0.1 eV,24 validating the XRD analysis. The best deconvolution of the XPS peak assigned to the O 1s was obtained by using three Voigt functions, positioned at 530.1 ± 0.1 eV, 530.8 ± 0.1 eV and 532.1 ± 0.1 eV, respectively. Typically, the first spectral component is allocated to the O–Sn2+, while the second one is assigned to O–Sn4+.20 The last component is assigned to Ox− ions of oxygen containing surface species.20 Moreover, the evolution of O 1s spectra agrees well with that of Sn 3d spectra and the contents of SnO2 and SnO in the 45 nm thick SnOx film were calculated using the Sn 3d spectra and were found to be 47.9 and 52.1%, respectively. In the case of the 200 nm SnOx film, the contents of SnO2, SnO and Sn were estimated to be 57.4, 37.1 and 5.5%, respectively. Typically, the n-type films are attributed to the increase of SnO2 content and decrease of the SnO.20,25 Thus, from now on, the thinner and thicker SnOx films are indexed as p-type and n-type SnOx films, respectively.

The optical properties of the SnOx thin films were investigated by depositing the films, under the same conditions, on borosilicate glass substrates. Fig. 3(a) exhibits the absorbance spectra of the p and n-type SnOx films. It reveals that the p-type SnOx film absorbs more light than the n-type one. The band gap energy values for both SnOx thin film films were estimated by using the following expression:20 α = B(hν − Eg)n(1)where hν is the incident photon energy, α is the absorption coefficient, B is the absorption edge width parameter, Eg is the band gap, and ‘n’ is the exponent dependent on direct (n = 0.5) or indirect (n = 2) transitions across the band gap. The value of the direct Eg is calculated using a regression analysis by extrapolating the linear region of the (αhν)2vs. hν plot towards zero, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The p and n-type SnOx films show a direct transition of 2.70 ± 0.01 eV and 3.00 ± 0.01 eV, respectively. The band gap value observed for the p-type SnOx film is similar to the observed in p-type SnOx films,20 while the band gap value obtained for the n-type films is closer to the one observed in a n-type SnO2 films.20,24 Therefore, the p-type films exhibit a lower band gap value than the n-type one, and the optical results corroborate the XRD and XPS analysis.

Spread resistance force microscopy was employed to evaluate the surface resistivity of the p-type SnOx/n-Si and n-type SnOx/p-Si HJs, as is shown in Fig. 4(a)–(d). Both 5 × 5 μm2 area scans over the p-type SnOx/n-Si and n-type SnOx/p-Si HJs revealed a non-homogeneous surface with an average roughness of ∼44 nm. The spread resistance scans shown in Fig. 4(a) and (c) for the p-type SnOx/n-Si and n-type SnOx/p-Si HJs revealed a non-uniform response. They display wide regions with poor conductivity and smaller localized regions with relatively high conductivity without any systematic correlation to topography. Moreover, it is possible to observe that the p-type SnOx film exhibits more conductive regions, possibly due to the higher concentration of SnO, which typically has better conductivity than SnO2.26

Fig. 4(b) and (d) show the current–voltage (I–V) curves for the p-type SnOx/n-Si and n-type SnOx/p-Si HJs obtained in the relatively conductive and resistive regions. The non-linear I–V curves profiles are typical for HJs and a saturation is reached below 4 V. In addition, no I–V hysteresis was observed.
Photovoltaic properties of the p-type SnOx/n-Si and n-type SnOx/p-Si HJs were studied at room temperature and the results are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively. The red and blue curves correspond to current density–voltage (J–V) under dark and light illumination conditions, respectively. The values of short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are 12.6 mA cm−2, 0.23 V, 27% and 8.3%, for the p-SnOx/n-Si HJ and 10.3 mA cm−2, 0.20 V, 20% and 4.5% for n-SnOx/p-Si HJ.

In order to understand the PV effect in the HJs, Fig. 6(a) shows the bands alignment on the p-Si/n-SnOx HJ under equilibrium. The build-in potentials were determined from the I–V characteristics. The energy of the Fermi levels in silicon at 300 K was calculated from the resistivity (doping concentration – Nd) given by the producer of the wafers, accordingly to the equation for n-type:27 (2)where NC is the effective density of states in the conduction band and for p-type:27 (3)where NV is the effective density of the states in valence band.

The values of energy bands were estimated from the optical properties and the values of the work function for the p-SnOx and n-SnOx were determined from Scanning Kelvin Probe method. The Fermi energy levels were estimated as described in ESI† and the estimated values are given Table S1.† In addition, to confirm the p-/n-type nature of the SnOx films, we have measured the surface photovoltage (SPV) through the same method. In Fig. S3(a) and (b)† it is shown the SPV as a function of time under light excitation pulses, for the p-SnOx and n-SnOx films, respectively. The response allows us to confirm the p- or n-type nature of the SnOx films.28 As shown in Fig. 6(a), the valence band offset is bigger than the conduction band offset and the main source of current are electrons in this case. Fig. 6(b) shows the same junction under illumination in open circuit state. The electron–holes pairs are generated in the absorber, which in this case is Si. The build-in field separates the carriers, so that the electrons go to the n-type side, and holes stay in the p-side. The carriers are accumulated in the opposite layers, which is the source of the potential difference known as open circuit voltage. In Fig. 6(c) the same junction under illumination in short circuit state is shown. The n and p sides are connected externally through electrodes. The electron–holes pairs are again generated in the Si. The electrons are swept to the n side, but they do not stay there, because the junction is shorted, so they move to the p-side of the junction and they meet with the hole, closing the circuit.
In the case of n-Si/p-SnOx HJ, the bands alignment is shown in Fig. 6(d)–(f), under equilibrium, and under illumination in open circuit state and in short circuit state. In this case the valence band offset is lower than the conduction band offset and the main source of current are the holes in this case. Due to the lower energy gap difference between SnOx and Si in this HJ, the offset is lower than in the previous case. This may reduce interfacial recombination. In fact, Knutsen et al.29 have shown that a large band offset between ZnO and Si causes a high concentration of interfacial defects that can contribute to high recombination, lowering the PCE.
In general, the PCE is affected by Voc, Jsc and fill factor (FF). The Voc is very similar for both HJs, so we have to analyze both FF and Jsc. The FF is usually dependent on shunt resistance (Rsh) and series resistance (Rs), which are different for both HJs. As the spread resistance measurements show, the p-SnOx is less resistive and, therefore, the Rs is lower, which can cause a higher rectification and, consequently, a better junction. In order to understand the Jsc values obtained for the HJs, EQE measurements were done and are shown in Fig. 5(c). Two distinct regions can be observed. Below 550 nm, the n-SnOx/p-Si HJ has a higher EQE, while above 550 nm, the p-SnOx/n-Si HJ has higher EQE. Moreover, for the n-SnOx/p-Si HJ the shape of the curve is more rectangular, as expected for the EQE, but the signal is lower. For the p-SnOx/n-Si HJ the shape is more triangular. Overall, the decrease in EQE is caused by loss due to the reflection or by the short diffusion length. In order to distinguish both causes, we measured the reflection on the HJs and they are shown in Fig. 5(d). Since the reflection of the p-SnOx/n-Si HJ is higher in the studied range, the reflection is not the reason for high EQE above 550 nm. Therefore, the low diffusion for the carriers in the junction should be the reason. Moreover, the generated photocurrent can be limited by the higher series resistance of the n-SnOx/p-Si junction in comparison to the p-SnOx/n-Si for longer wavelengths. The decrease of the EQE for lower wavelengths is generally caused by the recombination at the surface. Since the conduction in p-SnOx is mainly of hole type, as it was shown before, the high hole recombination at the surface defects possibly can cause the small EQE at the shorter wavelengths. In n-SnOx, where electrons are the main source of conduction, the hole recombination is not so impactful.
The Jsc values were also estimated through the integration of the EQE spectra and they were found to be equal to 7.2 mA cm−2 and 4.7 mA cm−2 for the p-SnOx/n-Si and n-SnOx/p-Si HJs, respectively. These values are usually lower than the ones obtained from the J–V curves due to the difference in the light illumination conditions between the J–V and EQE measurements. In the EQE measurement, the effect of the carrier recombination is expected to become more significant since the photocurrent generated at a selected λ, which is much weaker than that under AM1.5G illumination.30
After selecting the best HJ configuration that allows optimizing the PV response, the influence of inserting a thin ferroelectric BCZT layer between the Si substrate and the p-type SnOx film was analysed. Firstly, the structure was examined by XRD.
Additionally to the XRD diffractogram of the n-Si/p-SnOx HJ, the XRD pattern of the n-Si/BCZT/p-SnOx HJ exhibits two extra peaks located at 31.6° and 44.6°, which correspond to the (101) and (002/200) reflections of the perovskite tetragonal phase of BCZT (JCPDS card no. 05-0626), without any secondary phase (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  XRD patterns of the SnOx/n-Si and SnOx/BCZT/n-Si HJs. 
The structural quality of the n-Si/BCZT/p-SnOx HJ was investigated by TEM. Fig. 8(a) shows a low-magnification TEM image of the n-Si/BCZT/p-SnOx structure. Besides the presence of the BCZT and SnOx layers, it reveals the presence of a 3 nm SiOx native oxide layer at the n-Si/BCZT interface. Although its formation is unintentional, this layer can act as a passivation layer in a PV device.31 Therefore, it may be appropriate to taken into its effect on the PV response.

Fig. 8(b) is the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, where the main diffraction rings can be indexed as the characteristic rings of the SnO2 tetragonal rutile and BCZT perovskite phases, respectively. Moreover, no diffraction rings can be indexed to SnO due to the fact that SAED is a local technique. With a selected area aperture, we have chosen a small region from the sample on which we perform an electron diffraction, and the concentration of the SnO is small, as it was shown by spread resistance microscopy. However, we were able to unequivocally identify the presence of SnO in the SnOx layer by XRD and XPS measurements. Fig. 9 shows the high angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image at low-magnification and the EDS maps (on the right side of Fig. 9) revealing the distribution of Si, Ti and Sn elements in the layers. Moreover, a RGB image was obtained overlapping all the mentioned elements and clearly points to a sharp interface without any perceptible atomic interdiffusion between the layers, confirming the sharp high quality of this HJ. Moreover, it confirms the presence of the n-Si/BCZT/p-SnOx HJ structure, including a BCZT layer with a thickness of 145 ± 3 nm and a SnOx layer with a thickness of 45 ± 3 nm.

To investigate the role of the ferroelectricity of the BCZT layer on the PV response of the n-Si/SiOx/BCZT/p-SnOx HJ, PFM method was used. To achieve this, the ferroelectricity at the nanoscale level was investigated in a n-Si/SiOx/BCZT structure, as exhibited in Fig. 10(a)–(f). PFM scans of BCZT layer surface revealed an uniform film comprised of discrete crystallites not exceeding 100 nm in diameter, resulting in an average roughness of ∼0.63 nm, as evidenced in Fig. 10(a). Fig. 10(a–c) and (e–f) reveal that some contrast of ferroelectric domains can be traced to topographic features, namely outward domains pinning in some crystallites apexes. In plane phase, the scan shows a relatively stable signal, while off-plane phase scan spreads full 180° scale, revealing that the preferred polarization direction is off-plane. Moreover, in Fig. 10(d) a clear butterfly-shaped amplitude and hysteresis phase loops are obtained in the range ±35 Vdc, through all the film surface, confirming the ferroelectric nature of the BCZT layer.13,32 The asymmetric shape of the hysteresis loops is due to the asymmetry in the HJ.32 The saturation is reached above 9 Vdc, and the local coercive voltages (Vc), taken as the minima of amplitude loop, are found to be approximately −6.8 and +3.4 V. The coercive voltage was estimated to be 5.1 V.

The role of insertion of a ferroelectric BCZT layer between the Si substrate and the p-type SnOx film was investigated by spreading resistance force microscopy to locally evaluate the effect of such inclusion. Scan over 5 × 5 μm2 area of p-type SnOx surface on BCZT/SiOx/Si substrate revealed regular μm size crystallites resulting an average roughness ∼14 nm, as shown in Fig. 11(a). Spreading resistance scans also revealed no particular correlation with topography and relatively high conductivity through the entire surface, in contrast with the stand-alone SnOx film deposited on Si substrate. Local I–V curves in the ±5 Vdc range revealed at least 2 distinct profiles possibly due to a non-uniform local oxidation of SnOx film surface, besides the interaction with the ferroelectric BCZT film underneath. These two profiles are shown in Fig. 11(b) and are significantly different from the ones observed in p-type SnOx/SiOx/n-Si HJ (Fig. 4(b)). The I–V curves clearly show the effect of an exchange bias field induced by the BCZT layer polarization reversal, resulting in a I–V hysteresis curve. This I–V hysteresis behavior was already described in several ferroelectric-semiconductor heterostructures19,33 and is associated with the formation of a depletion region in the SnOx layer. Therefore, the I–V hysteresis can be understood by the barrier potential profile modulation at the depletion region, in the BCZT/SnOx junction, via ferroelectric polarization switching of the BCZT layer,19,33 and constitutes an evidence for the charge coupling between the layers.

In order to unravel the charge coupling between the layers, the band bending at the SnOx/BCZT interface was evaluated by XPS using CL spectra of Sn 3d5/2 and Ti 2p3/2, collected separately from the SnOx and BCZT films, respectively. Moreover, the CL spectra of Sn 3d5/2 and Ti 2p3/2 from a very thin SnOx layer (less than the photoelectron escape depth of photoelectrons generated in the SnOx) deposited on top of a 145 nm BCZT layer was also collected. The band bending induces the shifts in the atomic CL at the interface and the associated CL separation could then be used in the determination of the ΔEV. Fig. 12(a) shows the XPS of p-type SnOx (45 nm)/SiOx/n-Si HJ in the 490–(−4) eV energy range, where the peak assigned to the Sn 3d5/2 and the valence band (VB) are observed. Fig. 12(b) shows the XPS of BCZT (145 nm)/SiOx/n-Si HJ in the 461–(−1.5) eV energy range, where the peak assigned to the Ti 2p3/2 and the valence band (VB) are observed. Moreover, Fig. 12(c) displays the peaks assigned to Sn 3d5/2 and Ti 2p3/2 collected from a SnOx (2 nm)/BCZT (145 nm)/SiOx/Si HJ. The ΔEV at the SnOx/BCZT interface was determined using these measured CL spectra with the following equation:34,35 (4)where  is the energy difference between Ti 2p3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 CLs measured in the thin heterojunction SnOx/BCZT, while  and  are the VB energies with reference to the CL positions of thick SnOx and BCZT layers, respectively. As shown in Fig. 12(d), the ΔEV was found to be 0.53 eV. The ΔEC at the SnOx/BCZT interface was estimated from the following equation:34,35 (5)where  and  are the band gap values for the SnOx (Eg = 2.70 eV) and BCZT (Eg = 3.12 eV)36 layers, at room temperature. The ΔEC was found to be 0.11 eV, and in Fig. 12(d) is shown the energy band diagram for the SnOx/BCZT heterojunction. It is possible to conclude that the SnOx/BCZT heterojunction forms a type-I heterostructure,37 which is beneficial for PV applications since the problem of electron–hole recombination can be overcome with these band offsets.

Photovoltaic properties of the n-Si/SiOx/BCZT/p-SnOx HJ were measured at room temperature and the results are shown in Fig. 13(a)–(c). Fig. 13(a) shows the J–V dark curves, while in Fig. 13(b) it is shown the J–V curves under light illumination, with different −Vmax to +Vmax conditions. From Fig. 13(a) it is possible to observe a diode behavior, confirming that a p–n junction is formed. The current density at 5 V, under the dark and light, for −5 V to +5 V bias condition (Fig. 13(a) and (b)) is found to be 393.0 mA cm−2 and 355.0 mA cm−2, respectively. The decrease of the current density under light could be due to the field developed by the separation of charge carriers that lowers their mobility. However, the dark current density (at 0 V) is around 10 mA cm−2, which is lower than the one observed under light conditions. Besides, a J−V curve obtained for the −2 V to +2 V bias conditions under the dark is shown in inset of Fig. 13(a). The dark current in Si/SiOx/BCZT/p-SnOx HJ as shown in the inset of Fig. 13(a) is 0.13 mA cm−2, which is much lower compared to value of 31.8 mA cm−2 obtained in SnOx/n-Si HJ, at +0.6 V, as shown in Fig. 5(a). This clearly suggests that BCZT layer and BCZT/SnOx interface govern the charge transport properties. The magnified current density–voltage (J–V) curves around the origin are shown in the inset of Fig. 13(b), under light and different bias conditions. It is possible to observe that the Jsc and VOC are strongly dependent on the bias conditions. In order to highlight the impact of the bias conditions in the PCE, the PCE curves as a function of the applied voltage are shown in Fig. 13(c). It is possible to observe that the PCE increases from 3.4% up to 10.9% by increasing the bias conditions from ±2 V to ±6 V. The effect of bias voltage on the PV performance of Si/SiOx/BCZT/p-SnOx HJ is summarized in Table 1. The increase trend of Jsc and VOC and PCE with the increase of bias voltage further confirms ferroelectric polarization induced photovoltaic effect Si/SiOx/BCZT/p-SnOx HJ through the charge coupling between ferroelectric and semiconductor layer. Thus, by sweeping the I–V curve from −6 V to +6 V, the values of Jsc, VOC, fill factor (FF) and PCE are maximum and equal to 30.9 mA cm−2, −2.0 V, 19% and 10.9% for the n-Si/SiOx/BCZT/p-SnOx HJ. The PCE obtained in this HJ is 31% higher than the one without the BCZT ferroelectric layer. Usually the photoinduced charge carriers screen partially the polarization in ferroelectric films. However, the increase of Jsc, VOC and PCE with the increase of the bias voltage, as shown in Table 1, suggests that the ferroelectric polarization retains and is responsible for the charge separation.

In order to further understand the PV effect in the HJ, Fig. 14 shows a schematic band diagram of the HJ. At low bias conditions (from ±2 V up ±5 V), the initial ferroelectric polarization in BCZT layer is weak, because the applied voltage is below the coercive voltage of the BCZT layer, and the PCE is decreased when compared to the n-Si/SiOx/p-SnOx HJ. However, at ±6 V, we are able to polarize the BCZT layer and a depolarization field (EBCZT) emerges in the BCZT layer and is always against the polarization direction. Moreover, the contact between SnOx and BCZT produces an extra build-in electric field (Ebi-1) due to the formation of a p–n junction. At the same time another build-in electric field (Ebi-2) is formed at the BCZT/SiOx/n-Si HJ due to the band gap and carriers concentration difference at this interface.
 Fig. 14  Energy band diagram with the internal electric fields distribution and the generation, separation and motion of photo-induced carriers under incident light in n-Si/SiOx/BCZT/p-SnOx HJ. 
In spite of the fact that the barrier height/width increases at the SnOx/BCZT interface due to the direction of the ferroelectric polarization, Fig. 14 it clearly shows that an optimal alignment of internal fields is achieved in the n-Si/SiOx/BCZT/p-SnOx HJ and this leads to the enhanced PV effect. From the same figure it is also possible to follow the generation, separation and motion of photo-induced carriers under incident light in the n-Si/SiOx/BCZT/p-SnOx HJ. Table 2 shows a comparison of the PV performance obtained in this work with the ones presented in the literature for ferroelectric and ferroelectric-semiconductor devices. The attractive PV feature of the present device is its excellent PCE value (10.9%), which is significantly higher than the values reported in literature on ferroelectric-based devices.

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, we believe that the insertion of a ferroelectric BCZT layer in a n-Si/SiOx/p-SnOx HJ is a viable strategy to improve the PV performance of heterojunctions between transition metal oxides and Si. The spread resistance and piezo force microscopy together with XPS confirmed the impact of the interfacial charge coupling effect at the BCZT/SnOx interface that allows the fundamental understanding of the PV response of the HJs. Moreover, the insertion of the BCZT ferroelectric film provided a depolarizing field that facilitates the carriers' movement in a PV device. By inserting the BCZT layer, the PCE of the n-Si/SiOx/p-SnOx HJ increases 31%, from 8.3% up to 10.9%.
Therefore, the present work provides a promising route for the development of high-efficiency ferroelectric photovoltaic devices.
4. Experimental
First, Tin (Sn) films with thicknesses of 45 and 200 nm were grown by thermal evaporation, with a deposition rate of 2 Å s−1 at a base pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar, on n and p-type Si (100) substrates (Si-Mat), respectively. Consequently, an annealing at a temperature of 375 °C for 2 h in the presence of air to obtain the corresponding oxide films was done. We have shown previously that thinner films are p-type, while thicker films are n-type SnOx films.20
In order to grow the Si/BCZT/SnOx structure, first a BCZT film with a thickness of 145 nm was deposited using ion beam sputter deposition (IBSD) technique on top of a n-type Si substrate under the same conditions as described in ref. 44. After the deposition, the BCZT film was annealed in air during 30 minutes, at 750 °C. Next, a 45 nm thick p-type SnOx layer was grown. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out in a Bruker D8 Advance DaVinci Bragg–Brentano diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), produced at 40 kV and 40 mA, 2θ range: 25–65°; step size: 0.04°/1 s.
The chemical composition and oxidation states of the films were evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique. The measurements were carried out on an ultra-high vacuum surface analytical system equipped with SPECS Phoibos 150 hemispherical analyzer working in regime of multi-channel detection. The analyzer worked in the retarding-field mode using pass energy of 20 eV. Mg Kα was used for excitation and the binding energy scale of all XPS spectra was calibrated according to the C 1s reference (285.0 eV). The electron take-off angle was 90° and the analyzed area was a circle with 6 mm of diameter.
The TEM investigations have been performed with an analytical electron microscope JEM-ARM 200F operated at 200 kV. Cross-section TEM specimens have been prepared from the samples by mechanical polishing down to ca. 30 μm, followed by ion milling in a Gatan PIPS machine at 4 kV accelerating voltage and 7° incidence angle. Low-voltage (2 kV) milling was used as final ion polishing stage in order to reduce the amorphous surface layer enveloping the specimen.
For the electrical measurements, bottom Al electrodes (an ohmic contact on the Si wafer backside) were attached by electric spark. Piezo force microscopy (PFM) and spread resistance force microscopy were performed in a scanning probe microscope NT-MDT Solver Next equipped with an internal lock-in amplifiers and NT-MDT NTEGRA with external lock-in amplifier, using 21.(1) kHz driving frequency and commercial silicon probes with Cr/Pt coating Tap190E-G from Budget Sensors with a radius of curvature about 30 nm, resonance frequency ∼190 kHz and spring constant k about 48 N m−1. Current–voltage curves were obtained in the range ±5 Vdc and PFM loops in the range ±35 Vdc. The images were processed via WSxM 5.0 develop 9.1 software.
For the photoelectric measurements, an indium tin oxide (ITO) top electrode with 2 × 6 mm2 size was deposited by IBSD as reported in ref. 5. The photovoltaic (PV) response was investigated by performing current–voltage (I–V) measurements, both in the dark and under light illumination, with a maximum power density of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 G) using a ReRa Solutions solar simulator. Moreover, a computer controlled four-quadrant source-measure unit was used to apply an external bias and to measure the current. Additionally, the PV external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by using a Bentham PVE 300 system. The PV results are a reflection of 3 measurements in each 3 cells and correspond to their average. The same system was used for reflectivity measurements, using the integrating sphere. Scanning Kelvin Probe measurements were performed using SKP5050 system from KP Technology.
