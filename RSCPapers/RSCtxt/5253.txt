    , Accepted 15th March 2014First published on 17th March 2014AbstractThe practical application of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) requires high photovoltaic efficiency and good photovoltaic stability. This work reports nanocomposites of two-dimensional graphene oxide (GO) and one-dimensional multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as the gelator of gel electrolytes for quasi-solid state DSCs. The composite gels are formed by immobilizing an organic solvent, 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN), with GO and MWCNTs, and the gel electrolytes are prepared by adding iodine, 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, guanidinium thiocynate and 4-tert butylpyridine into the GO–MWCNT–MPN composite gels. GO sheets can gel organic solvents because of their hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains. The MWCNTs can reinforce the solid networks formed by GO sheets and reduce the ionic diffusion length of the redox species within the electrolyte as MWCNTs are conductive and catalytic toward the electrochemical reduction of I3−. The presence of MWCNTs in the gel electrolyte increases both the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and the short-circuit current (JSC) of DSCs so as to increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE). The optimal PCE of the DSCs with GO–MWCNT–MPN gel electrolyte is 7.12% under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2), which is significantly higher than that (6.54%) of the gel DSCs without MWCNTs.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are regarded as the next-generation solar cells due to their merits, including low fabrication cost and decent power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–7 A PCE of >12% has been observed on DSCs.8 A DSC is fundamentally a photoelectrochemical device. The architecture of DSCs includes a mesoporous TiO2 photoanode anchored with a monolayer of dye molecules, an electrolyte containing redox species and a catalytic counter electrode. There are five major steps during the light-to-electricity conversion of DSCs. The first step is light absorption by the dye molecules, which stimulates the excitation of electrons from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The second step is the electron injection from the LUMO of the dye molecules into the conduction band of TiO2. The third step is electron transport across the mesoporous TiO2 film to the external circuit. The fourth step is the regeneration of dye molecules by obtaining electrons from the redox species like iodide in the electrolyte. The last step is the transport of redox species to the counter electrode and regeneration of the redox species by acquiring electrons from the counter electrode. The operation mechanism indicates that the electrolyte plays a pivotal role in the photovoltaic process of DSCs. The electrolyte is involved in at least the regeneration of the dye molecules and the transport of the redox species. To facilitate mass transport, organic solvents like acetonitrile and valeronitrile are often used as the solvent of the electrolyte in DSCs, because they have high a diffusion coefficient for the redox species. These liquid electrolytes can give rise to high power conversion efficiency (PCE) for DSCs. However, they are highly volatile and cause severe leakage problems for DSCs.9–11 Several approaches have been investigated to solve this problem. Non-volatile materials, including room temperature ionic liquids,12,13 inorganic p-type semiconductors,14,15 organic hole transport materials16,17 and gel electrolytes,18–28 have been reported to replace the liquid electrolyte. Gel electrolytes provide a practical solution to attain DSCs with high efficiency and good stability, since gel electrolytes can behave like solids in terms of their mechanical properties and like liquid electrolytes in terms of their ionic diffusion.
Gel electrolytes can give rise to quasi solid-state DSCs with good photovoltaic stability and high PCE. The properties of a gel electrolyte strongly depend on the gelator. In a gel, the fluid is immobilized by three-dimensional solid networks formed by the gelator.29 In terms of the nature of interactions among the gelator molecules, gels can be categorized into physical gels and chemical gels.30 The solid networks are formed due to the inter-molecular interactions among the gelator molecules for the physical gels. They are usually thermally reversible and can effectively penetrate into the mesoporous TiO2 electrode. Thus, they are often used as the electrolyte for quasi-solid-state DSCs because they have solid-like mechanical behaviour while having liquid-like ionic conductivity. The gelators of physical gels include polymers,18,19 low molecular weight organic molecules,20,21 and nanoparticles.22,23 Novel gelators are always important for the development of high-performance quasi solid-state electrochemical devices including DSCs. Carbon nanomaterials have gained considerable attention, and they have been investigated in DSCs. However, research has concentrated on their application in the working and counter electrodes of DSCs by exploiting their electrical conductivity and catalysis.29–34 Little effort has focused on applying carbon nanomaterials in the electrolytes of DSCs. Aida et al. observed that carbon nanotubes could gel ionic liquids,35 and ionic liquid/carbon nanotube gels were investigated for quasi solid-state DSCs.36,37 However, these DSCs exhibit PCEs of lower than 2.5%, because ionic liquids are viscous. Addition of a small amount of oxidized carbon nanotubes can reduce the viscosity of the ionic liquids and lead to the improvement in the PCE of DSCs.38 Recently, we found that graphene oxide (GO, chemical structure shown in Scheme 1) can serve as a gelator for polar organic solvents due to the presence of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains.39 Although hydrogels and aerogels with two-dimensional graphene or graphene oxide have been reported,40–45 their properties and application are quite different from gel electrolytes. We still know little about gel electrolytes with two-dimensional materials. The ionic conductivity is very important for gel electrolytes. Gels with two-dimensional nanometer materials can be significantly different from conventional gels with polymers, small molecules or nanoparticles as the gelator. Much more work is needed to understand the GO gel electrolytes and their application.

In order to further improve the mechanical properties of the GO gel electrolytes and the PCE of DSCs, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were incorporated into the GO gel electrolytes and the composite gel electrolytes were used for quasi solid-state DSCs in this work. The reason for incorporating one-dimensional MWCNTs into the GO gel electrolytes is that the composites of graphene with polymers or carbon nanotubes exhibit superior functions to graphene only, such as electrocatalysts for DSCs46 and as electrodes for energy storage.47–49 However, there is no report on gel electrolytes with two-dimensional GO and one-dimensional MWCNTs. We found that the presence of MWCNTs in the gel electrolyte can reinforce the GO gels and remarkably improve the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current (JSC) so as to increase the PCE of the quasi solid-state DSCs. The optimal PCE of the DSCs with GO–MWCNT gel electrolyte is 7.12%, saliently higher than that (6.54%) of the DSCs without MWCNTs in the gel electrolyte.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Natural graphite powder (SP-1 graphite, purity > 99.99%) was purchased from the Bay Carbon Inc. It had an average particle size of ∼30 μm. MWCNTs produced by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) were obtained from the Chendu Organic Chemicals Co Ltd. The purity was >95%, outer diameter was 8–15 nm, inner diameter was 3–5 nm, length was ∼50 μm and specific surface area was >233 m2 g−1.
DSL 18 NR-T (20 nm) and WER2-O (350–400 nm) pastes were supplied by Dyesol. Ruthenium 535-bis TBA (N719 dye) and Surlyn (ionomer films ∼25 μm thick) were purchased from Solaronix SA. Guanidinium thiocynate and titanium tetrachloride were supplied by Fluka and Merck, respectively. Other chemicals, including tert-butanol anhydrous (purity > 99.5%), acetonitrile anhydrous (purity > 99.8%), chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, purity = 99%), 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII, purity > 98%), iodine (purity > 99.99% trace metal basis), 3-methoxyproponitrile (MPN, purity > 98%), 98% sulphuric acid, 37% hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrate (purity > 99%), potassium permanganate, and hydrogen peroxide solution (>30%), were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
2.2. Preparation of GO
GO was prepared through a modified Hummer's process.50,51 1 g natural graphite powder was mixed with 1 g sodium nitrate and 48 mL 98% sulfuric acid. Under vigorous stirring, 6 g potassium permanganate (VII) was slowly added into the mixture. The solution was stirred in an ice bath for 90 min and then in a water bath at 35 °C for 2 h 40 mL de-ionized water was dropwise added into the mixture over 30 min. The temperature of the mixture rose to 90 °C. 100 mL deionized water and 10 mL 30% hydrogen peroxide solution were added. GO was collected by centrifugation. It was then successively rinsed with 5% HCl solution and de-ionized water until the pH value of the solution reached 7. Finally, GO was frozen with liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried with a Laconco Freezone freeze drier for two days.
2.3. Preparation of GO–MWCNT–MPN gels and gel electrolytes
3-Methoxyproponitrile (MPN) was used as the solvent of the gels. The GO/MPN gels were prepared according to the procedure presented in our early report.40 The GO–MWCNT–MPN composite gels were prepared by mixing GO and MWCNTs with MPN and mechanically grinding the mixtures in an agate mortar. Ultrasonication produced by a Sonics & Materials Vibracell VC 505 ultrasonic processor was applied for some GO–MWCNT–MPN to disperse MWCNTs.
The gel electrolytes were prepared by adding 0.2 M I2, 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII) , 0.1 M guanidinium thiocynate and 0.5 M tert-butyl pyridine into the MPN solutions dispersed with GO at 80 °C. The solutions became gels at room temperature. MWCNTs were then added by mechanical grinding or ultrasonication dispersion.
2.4. Fabrication of DSCs
DSCs were fabricated by the conventional method.52,53 The TiO2 working electrode was comprised of a 10 μm-thick mesoporous TiO2 layer (Dyesol DSL 18NR-T paste) and a 5 μm-thick scattering TiO2 layer (Dyesol WER4-O reflector paste). The TiO2 electrodes were immersed in a 0.5 mM N719 dye solution of tert-butanol and acetonitrile (volume ratio of 1:1) for 24 h. A GO–MWCNT–MPN gel electrolyte was spread uniformly across the dye-impregnated TiO2 photoanode. This photoanode was subsequently assembled with a counter electrode with a 25 μm thick ionomer film.
The counter electrode was fabricated through the pyrolysis of an ethanol solution of 0.2 M H2PtCl6 on a FTO glass at 400 °C for 15 minutes.
2.5. Characterization of materials and DSCs
Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images were taken using a Zeiss supra 40 field emission scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images were acquired with a JOEL 100CX 2010F with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The thicknesses of the TiO2 films were determined using a Tencor P-10 Alpha-Step profiler. Dynamic mechanical analyses were performed using an Advanced Rheometric Expansion System (ARES) G2 Rheometer in the dynamic mode. The cone diameter and cone angle were 20 mm and 1 degree, respectively. The ionic conductivities of the gel electrolytes were determined with a CDM 210 Conductivity Meter equipped with a CDC 641 cell and a temperature sensor. Steady-state cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out with an ECO CHEMIE Autolab system. A platinum microelectrode with a diameter of 25.6 μm, a platinum strip and a Ag/AgNO3 electrode were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The potential scan rate was 10 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed with an ECO CHEMIE Autolab (PGSTAT 302N and FRA2) system. The frequency range was 105–10−1 Hz. A dc bias of the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of DSCs was superimposed on an ac signal of 10 mV.
The photovoltaic performance of the DSCs was measured with a computer-programmed Keithley 2400 source meter under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) by a Newport's Oriel class A solar simulator, which was certified by the JIS C 8912 standard. A circular mask with a diameter of 5.2 mm was placed over the cells during each test. The DSCs were kept in the dark at room temperature for the device ageing study.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Formation and characterization of GO–MWCNT–MPN gels
GO was characterized using FTIR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the results confirmed the presence of the functional groups, such as hydroxyl, ketone and carboxylic groups.39 As reported in our previous work, GO can gel MPN when its loading is greater than 2.5 wt%.39 The GO–MWCNT–MPN organogels were prepared by mixing GO and MWCNTs with MPN and mechanically grinding. The incorporation of MWCNTs hardly affects the minimum GO loading required for the gel formation.
The rheological properties of GO–MWCNT–MPN mixtures were investigated using dynamic mechanical measurements. Fig. 1 shows the frequency dependences of the storage (G′) and loss (G′′) moduli of two mixtures with and without MWCNTs. G′ and G′′ represent the elastic and viscous components of the material, respectively.54,55G′ is always greater than G′′ in the whole frequency range, and both are almost insensitive to the frequency for both mixtures. These results suggest that the two mixtures with and without GO behave as gels, but the presence of 0.25 wt% MWCNTs remarkably increases both the G′ and G′′ values. This implies that MWCNTs make the 3-dimensional solid networks stronger. As reported by Huang et al., there are both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains in GO sheets.56–59 MWCNTs are hydrophobic and can have strong π–π interaction with the hydrophobic domains of GO sheets. Thus, MWCNTs can bridge the GO sheets in the gels and lead to improvement in the mechanical strength of the gels. Carbon nanotubes have been used as additives to reinforce polymer gels by other labs.60,61

In order to understand the structure of the 3-dimensional solid networks in the gel, the morphologies of the xerogels prepared from the GO–MPN and GO–MWCNT–MPN organogels were studied by SEM (Fig. 2). The xerogels were prepared by freeze drying the corresponding organogels with liquid nitrogen. The MWCNTs have a remarkable effect on the morphology of the xerogels. Solid networks are formed by the GO sheets for the GO–MPN gel, while MWCNTs are dispersed in the GO networks for the GO–MWCNT–MPN gels.

The SEM images also indicate that the solid networks of the GO–MWCNT–MPN gels are affected by the MWCNT dispersion. MWCNT bundles can be observed when they are dispersed in the gels by mechanical grinding without ultrasonication. The MWCNTs can be de-bundled more by ultrasonication.62 The MWCNT bundles become noticeably smaller after ultrasonication, and they are dispersed uniformly in the solid networks. In addition, the MWCNT dispersion affects the pore size and pore density of the xerogels. There are big pores for the xerogels with MWCNTs dispersed by mechanical grinding without ultrasonication. The pore size is remarkably reduced after ultrasonication is applied.
GO–MWCNT xerogels were studied with TEM to understand the interaction between GO and MWCNT in the gel (Fig. 3). Nanotubes with a diameter of around 10 nm can be observed. The tubular structures are black on the edge while the color becomes lighter in the middle. This suggests that the MWCNTs may be wrapped with GO sheets because GO has hydrophobic domains. As Huang et al. observed, GO can actually serve as a surfactant to stabilize carbon nanotubes in solvents.58 GO forms a structure like a micelle to accommodate carbon nanotubes inside. The interconnections of the MWCNTs can be observed as well. This interconnection makes the networks stronger and conductive.

GO is used as the gelator for the gel electrolyte in this work. This is different from the work recently reported by Chen et al.63 They used GO as an additive for polymer electrolytes and observed that the addition of GO can enhance the ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolytes.
3.2. Ionic conductivity and I3− diffusion coefficient of MWCNTs–GO–MPN gels
Gel electrolytes were prepared by blending guanidinium thiocynate, 4-tert-butylpyridine, PMII and I2 into the MWCNTs–GO–MPN gels. Both PMII and I2 can slightly reduce GO. The reduction of GO increases the mechanical moduli of the gel electrolytes.39
The room-temperature ionic conductivity of the gel electrolytes depends on the MWCNT loading and the MWCNT dispersion (Fig. 4). The ionic conductivities of gel electrolytes with various amounts of MWCNTs that were dispersed by ultrasonication for 20 min were measured (Fig. 4a). The gel electrolyte without MWCNTs has the highest ionic conductivity of 11.21 mS cm−1. It decreases to 9.58 mS cm−1 in the presence of 0.125 wt% MWCNTs in the gel electrolytes, but the ionic conductivity then increases with an increase in MWCNT loading. The effect of the MWCNT loading on the ionic conductivity of the gel electrolytes can be ascribed to two factors. The presence of more solids in the gel electrolyte lowers the ionic conductivity.39 However, when the MWCNT loading is so high that the MWCNTs interconnect and form conductive networks, the ionic conductivity increases as the diffusion distance of the ions decreases. The decrease in the ionic diffusion distance caused by the presence of conductive nanoparticles and nanotubes has also been observed on polymer gel electrolytes and ionic liquids.64–69
 Fig. 4  Dependence of room-temperature ionic conductivity of (a) 2.5 wt% GO–MWCNT–MPN gels on the MWCNT loading and (b) 2.5 wt% GO-0.25 wt% MWCNT–MPN gels on the ultrasonication time of the MWCNTs. MWCNTs for (a) were ultrasonicated for 20 min. 
The effect of the MWCNT dispersion on the ionic conductivity of the gel electrolytes was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 4b, the gel electrolyte with MWCNTs dispersed by mechanical grinding without ultrasonication has the highest ionic conductivity of 10.3 mS cm−1. The ionic conductivity slightly decreases to 10 mS cm−1 after ultrasonication for 10 min. The room-temperature ionic conductivity of the gel electrolytes decreases with an increase in ultrasonication time for MWCNTs. Better dispersion of MWCNTs makes the three-dimensional solid networks stronger, which leads to a decrease in the ionic conductivity.
The ionic conductivities of the gel electrolytes were investigated from 25 up to 70 °C (Fig. 5). All the ionic conductivities increase at higher temperatures. The temperature dependency of the ionic conductivities was analyzed with the Vogel–Tammann–Fulcher (VTF) model,70,71  where σ0 is the pre-exponential component, Ea is the activation energy for ionic diffusion, R is the gas constant, and T0 is the glass transition temperature of the electrolyte. The activation energy is dependent on the MWCNT loading (Fig. 6a). The gel electrolyte without ultrasonication on MWCNTs has the lowest activation energy of 3.33 kJ mol−1. It increases after the addition of MWCNTs. The highest activation energy of 3.42 kJ mol−1 appears for the gel electrolyte with 0.125 wt% MWCNTs. The variation of the activation energy with the MWCNT loading is in good agreement with the room-temperature ionic conductivity of the gel electrolytes. The effect of the MWCNT loading on the activation energy of the gel electrolytes can be understood using the same reasons for its effect on the room-temperature ionic conductivity.

 Fig. 6  Dependence of the activation energy of the ionic conductivity of (a) MWCNTs-2.5 wt% GO–MPN gel electrolytes on the loading of MWCNTs, which were ultrasonicated for 20 min and (b) 0.25 wt% MWCNTs-2.5 wt% GO–MPN gel electrolytes on the ultrasonication time of the MWCNT. 
The activation energy also depends on the MWCNT dispersion in the gel electrolytes (Fig. 6b). It is 3.34 kJ mol−1 for the gel electrolyte without ultrasonication on MWCNTs. It slightly increases with an increasing ultrasonication time of MWCNTs. It becomes 3.42 kJ mol−1 for the gel electrolyte with MWCNTs ultrasonicated for 60 min. The effect of the ultrasonication time of MWCNTs on the activation energy is consistent with that on the room-temperature ionic conductivities of the gel electrolytes.
The ion diffusion in the gel electrolyte was further investigated with steady-state cyclic voltammetry. In a DSC, the concentration of the I− ions are significantly higher than that of the I3− in the electrolyte. Hence, the I3− ions are the charge limiting species in the electrolyte of a DSC and the diffusion of these ions affects the current of the device. The apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp) of I3− at 25 °C was investigated with steady-state cyclic voltammetry using a platinum microelectrode as the working electrode (Fig. 7). The cathodic current correlates to the reduction of I3− ions. The Dapp values of I3− could be determined in terms of the equation,72Iss = 4nrCFDapp,where Iss is the steady state current, n is the number of electrons transferred per molecule, F is the Faraday constant, r is the radius of the microelectrode, and C is the concentration. Fig. 8a illustrates the dependence of the I3− diffusion coefficient of the 2.5 wt% GO–MWCNT–MPN gel electrolytes on the MWCNT loading. The I3− diffusion coefficient is 4.09 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 for the gel electrolyte without MWCNTs. It decreases after MWCNT incorporation. It then increases with increasing MWCNT loading. The minimum I3− diffusion coefficient appears for the gel electrolyte with 0.125 wt% MWCNTs.

 Fig. 8  Dependence of the I3− diffusion coefficient of (a) 2.5 wt% GO–MWCNT–MPN gel electrolytes on the MWCNT loading and (b) 2.5 wt% GO-0.25 wt% MWCNTs–MPN gel electrolytes on the ultrasonication time of the MWCNTs. The MWCNTs for (a) were ultrasonicated for 20 min. 
The I3− diffusion coefficient also depends on the MWCNT dispersion as shown in Fig. 8b. The I3− diffusion coefficient of the gel electrolyte with MWCNTs dispersed by mechanical grinding without ultrasonication was 4.06 × 10−6 cm2 s−1. It decreases to 3.92 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 when MWCNTs were ultrasonicated for 10 min. It further decreases with a further increase in the ultrasonication time. The results of the ion diffusion obtained by steady-state cyclic voltammetry are consistent with those of the measurements on the ionic conductivity of the gel electrolytes. Similarly, the dependency of ion diffusion on the MWCNT loading and the ultrasonication time can be ascribed to the reinforcement of gels by MWCNTs and the decrease in the ion diffusion distance caused by the conductive MWCNT networks.
3.3. Quasi solid-state DSCs with GO–MWCNT–MPN gels
The GO–MWCNT–MPN gel electrolytes were used for quasi solid-state DSCs. The photovoltaic performances of the DSCs with gel electrolytes of different MWCNT loadings are presented in Fig. 9, and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The incorporation of MWCNTs into the gel electrolyte can simultaneously increase both the VOC and JSC, so as to increase the PCE of the quasi solid-state DSCs. The DSCs with 0.25 wt% MWCNTs in the gel electrolyte exhibit an optimal PCE of 7.12%. This is significantly higher than that (6.54%) of the DSCs without MWCNT in the gel electrolyte. The increase in JSC can be ascribed to the reduction of the ion diffusion length because MWCNTs can catalyze the iodide reduction and conduct the electrons. However, MWCNTs as nanometer materials also scatter light. Too high a MWCNT loading leads to less light absorption by the dye molecules.73 In addition, a high MWCNT loading may affect the penetration of the gel electrolytes into the pores of the mesoporous TiO2 working electrode, because MWCNTs reinforce the gel electrolytes.

As discussed above, the MWCNT dispersion affects the morphology of the solid networks and the ionic conductivity of the gel electrolytes. The effect of the MWCNT dispersion on the performance of DSCs was investigated (Fig. 10 and Table 2). JSC, VOC and PCE remarkably increase when the MWCNTs are ultrasonicated for about 20 min in comparison with the DSCs without ultrasonication for MWCNTs. However, the PCE drops when the ultrasonication time is longer than 20 min. As discussed previously, increasing the ultrasonication time can reduce the bundle length and the bundle size of the MWCNTs. This improves the dispersion of the MWCNTs throughout the solid network and thus increases the exposed surface area of the MWCNTs. This leads to enhanced catalysis for the electrochemical reduction of I3− and further reduces the ionic diffusion length of the redox species. Hence, this will decrease the possibility of electron–hole pair recombination within the electrolyte, leading to an improvement in both the JSC and VOC of the devices. However, longer ultrasonication gives rise to better MWCNT dispersion in the gel electrolytes and low ion diffusion coefficient. Thus, if MWCNTs are ultrasonicated for too long, the PCE of the DSCs decreases.

The optimal efficiency of the DSCs with GO–MWCNT gel electrolyte reaches 7.12%. This is almost the same as that of the liquid cells. As presented in our earlier report, DSCs with MPN solvent exhibited the following photovoltaic performance: VOC = 0.74 V, JSC = 12.90 mA cm−2, FF = 0.75, and PCE = 7.18%.35
The high photovoltaic efficiency implies that the presence of conductive MWCNTs in the gel electrolyte does not lead to a short circuit. This is probably related to the contact between the gel electrolyte and the TiO2 working electrode. TiO2 is hydrophilic, while MWCNTs are hydrophobic. Thus, MWCNTs are not in direct contact with TiO2 when the loading of MWCNTs is low.
DSCs with different gel electrolytes were analyzed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Fig. 11a presents the Nyquist plots in the whole frequency range, and Fig. 11b shows only the semicircles in the high frequency range. There are usually two semicircles in the Nyquist plot of a typical DSC. The semicircle at the higher frequency region accounts for the charge transfer at the counter electrode, while the one at the low frequency region corresponds to the charge transfer at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, TiO2/dye interface and electron transport through the mesoporous TiO2 anode. The interfacial charge recombination resistance (Ri) across the TiO2/electrolyte and the TiO2/dye interfaces could be determined by fitting the Nyquist plots with the equivalent circuit displayed in the insets of Fig. 11a. The Ri value is 63.9 Ω for the DSC without MWCNT, and it slightly increases to 64.2 Ω when 0.25 wt% MWCNTs is added into the gel electrolytes by mechanical grinding without ultrasonication. Ri increases to 65.3 Ω when the MWCNTs are ultrasonicated for 20 min. These results implied that the dispersion of 0.25 wt% MWCNTs without ultrasonication has no noticeable effect on the charge recombination processes. In fact, the two DSCs have almost the same photovoltaic performance. However, the addition of MWCNTs by ultrasonication for 20 min increases the Ri value, which suggests a reduction in the interfacial charge recombination and thus improves both the VOC and JSC.

(b) Magnified Nyquist plots for the semicircles in the high frequency range. Active area of DSCs was 0.21 cm2. The inset in (a) is the equivalent circuit. Ri and C1 are for the resistance and capacitance at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, Rct and C2 are for the resistance and capacitance at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface, W and Rs are for the Warburg and series impedance, respectively. 
The ageing stability of the DSCs with 2.5 wt% GO-0.25 wt% MWCNTs–MPN gel electrolyte and MPN liquid electrolyte was investigated for a period of 30 days (Fig. 12). The DSC with the gel electrolyte is clearly more stable than that with the liquid electrolyte. The PCE of the DSC using the GO–MWCNT–MPN gel electrolyte decreases by only 16% after 30 days, while that using the liquid electrolyte decreases by 21.5%. This is because the gel electrolyte is less volatile than the liquid electrolyte.

4. Conclusions
Nanocomposites of GO and MWCNTs were used as the gelator of gel electrolytes. The GO–MWCNT composite gel electrolytes were used for quasi-solid state DSCs. GO sheets can gel organic solvents due to the presence of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains, while MWCNTs can reinforce the solid networks formed by GO sheets by bridging the GO sheets. In addition, MWCNTs can reduce the ionic diffusion length of the redox species within the electrolyte because MWCNTs are conductive and catalytic toward the electrochemical reduction of I3−. The ionic conductivity of the gel electrolytes depends on the loading and dispersion of MWCNTs. The presence of MWCNTs in the gel electrolyte significantly improves the PCE of the gel DSCs. The optimal PCE of DSCs with the GO–MWCNT–MPN gel electrolyte is 7.12%, which is significantly higher than that (6.54%) of the gel DSCs without MWCNTs.
