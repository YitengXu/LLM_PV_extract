    , Accepted 6th September 2017First published on 6th September 2017AbstractIodide–fullerene π interactions play decisive roles in n-doping and electron transport of fullerenes at the perovskite–PCBM interface in the devices of perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs). But instability issues of perovskites due to halide anion migration greatly limit the practical application of Pero-SCs. To fully understand the properties of these interactions, we conducted systematic studies on fullerene ammonium halides containing I−, Br−, and Cl− that exist in perovskites. Our findings show that fullerene is an overwhelmingly strong electron acceptor that activates relatively inert halide anions (Br− and Cl−) and initiates the n-doping process by forming anion–π interactions, which are closely related to the performance and stability of the p–i–n Pero-SC devices based on a CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br, and Cl) light absorber and a fullerene (C60 or PCBM) electron transport layer (ETL). At the perovskite–fullerene interface in the p–i–n Pero-SC, n-doping occurs by forming iodide–fullerene π interactions, which facilitates charge transport and improves the performance of the devices by suppressing hysteresis. On the basis of experimental evidence and computational results, we propose a plausible mechanism for iodide migration attributed to its n-doping at the interface and subsequent hopping of slidable iodide to a neighbouring fullerene given that space and energy are favorable. Thus, the migration of halide anions through the fullerene layer results in perovskite degradation and performance decay of the devices. This work highlights the importance of halide anion–fullerene π interactions in materials chemistry and explores the introduction of a halide anion blocking ETL in p–i–n Pero-SCs.
Introduction
The introduction of halogen into π-functional systems in organic semiconducting materials endows these materials with tunable optoelectronic properties and broadens their applications in organic light-emitting diodes, organic field-effect transistors, and organic solar cells.1–6 Therefore, covalently linked halogen–π functional systems have been extensively studied in the past few decades. In recent years, weak halide anion–π noncovalent interaction, attracted more and more attention because of the importance of π-rings in anion recognition and transport anions in key chemical and biological processes.7–17 Coincidentally, such an interaction has emerged as a new route in generating a functional motif in molecules to derive unique properties, especially in optoelectronic systems involving halide anions in the presence of fullerenes exhibiting a unique spherical π-conjugated electronic structure.18–26 In contrast with classical anion–π interactions, little is known about the properties of halide anion–fullerene π noncovalent interactions, which could endow fullerene materials with unique optoelectronic functions.
We had performed systematic studies on the electronic and spatial structure of the stable and highly conductive fullerene ammonium iodide (PCBANI) and elucidated the mechanism of a cross self-n-doping process involving strong anion–π noncovalent interactions between iodide anions and core fullerenes and the head-to-tail cation–π interactions of its side chain (Scheme 1a). Furthermore, we proposed an electron transport model in a PCBANI film based on the solid evidence.24 We also found that fullerene ammonium bromide (PCBDANBr) exhibits a relatively high conductivity (1.05 S m−1).19 It suggests that bromide acts as a dopant which could be partially oxidized by the fullerene core to form bromide anion–fullerene π interactions. Then, how about fullerene ammonium chloride, namely, whether partial redox occurs between chloride and fullerene to realize n-doping. Moreover, the factors that are crucial in determining the properties of halide anion–fullerene π interactions in n-doped fullerene ammonium halides remain unknown. Therefore, PCBANI's analogues, namely fullerene bromide (PCBANBr) and fullerene chloride (PCBANCl) (Scheme 1a), were prepared and characterized using the developed comprehensive method to fully understand the properties of halide anion–fullerene π interactions and to clarify the influence of halide anions on self-n-doping. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the super oxidative properties of fullerene that enable the activation of inert halide anions. Given that the halide anion and fullerene species coexist in some energy conversion processes, such as Pero-SC devices, the issues related to halide anion–fullerene π systems are expected to increasingly attract attention.

Organic metal halide PSCs have been rapidly developed in recent years and thus have reached a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 22.1% for conventional n–i–p Pero-SCs. Moreover, emergent p–i–n Pero-SCs have been extensively investigated because of their simple fabrication and low hysteresis, and have yielded an efficiency of as high as 20.3%.27–29 At the perovskite–fullerene interface in the p–i–n Pero-SC device, n-doping commonly occurs by forming iodide–fullerene π interactions to produce highly conductive n-doped fullerene, which facilitates charge transport and improves the performance (such as PCE, Jsc, and FF) of Pero-SCs with reduced hysteresis.30–35 For example, Jeng et al. verified the formation of a donor–acceptor interface at the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite/C60 buck heterojunction and the modulation of photovoltaic performance by using acceptors with varied LUMO levels.30 Bastiani et al. found that under device operation, iodide migrates to PCBM which serves as an electron-extraction layer, resulting in evidently improved charge extraction.34 Moreover, a study on transient phenomena of perovskite films shows that ions can specifically interact with a PCBM layer, inducing electronic doping. Researchers speculated that such an I−/PCBM interaction is at the origin of the preconditioning requirement for stabilizing the device and for improving its open circuit voltage with respect to the first scan. Moreover, Xu et al. reported on a perovskite–PCBM hybrid solid with significantly reduced hysteresis and recombination loss.35 In another respect, a considerable effort has been currently devoted to addressing the issue of the instability of Pero-SC devices given that such an instability resulting from perovskite degradation greatly limits their practical applications.36–41 Water and oxygen are ever believed to be the major degradation sources for Pero-SC devices. However, studies where devices were encapsulated or measured in a glovebox still show significant device degradation. Conings et al. demonstrated that significant decomposition already occurs during the annealing of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite at 85 °C even in an inert atmosphere.42 Recently, the migration of halide anions was demonstrated and regarded as a critical factor in the performance and lifetime of Pero-SC devices. For example, perovskite–PCBM interfacial degradation in planar p–i–n Pero-SCs was observed by Guerrero and Yang.43 Wang et al. provided direct evidence supporting the diffusion of iodide and methylammonium ions through the PCBM ETL and their accumulation at a Ag inner surface at a high operating temperature of 85 °C.44 Thus, they proposed a mechanism for the silver electrode-induced thermal degradation of perovskites. These studies show that iodide n-doping of fullerene at an interface is inevitable, indicating that iodide migration is closely related to the fullerene electron transport layer (ETL). However, the detailed pathway and mechanism remain to be elucidated. Considering that we are interested in the applications of fullerenes in photovoltaic cells (OSCs and Pero-SCs),18,19,45–48 we are intrigued by the instability issues of Pero-SC devices and thus we attempt to address the instability issues.
Perovskites are materials with the formula ABX3, where X is an anion and A and B are cations with different sizes. In Pero-SCs, the halide anion X is generally iodine (RX = 0.220 nm), although Br and Cl are also commonly used (RX = 0.196 nm and 0.181 nm); a halide anion is usually incorporated into mixed perovskites (such as CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx) to fine tune the properties of the latter.28 In p–i–n Pero-SCs, fullerene (i.e., C60 or PCBM) is commonly spin-coated on the perovskite layer to act as the ETL (Fig. 1). We speculate based on our study on self-n-doping of PCBANI that the issues on device performance and stability are closely related to halide anion n-doping of fullerene, resulting in the migration of anions at the perovskite–fullerene ETL interface. On the basis of the mechanism of halide anion's doping of fullerene, we perform a systematic study on an iodide–fullerene model system involving a doping effect and iodide migration through the fullerene ETL in p–i–n Pero-SCs. This study highlights the importance of halide anion–fullerene π interactions and illustrates the mechanism of halide ion migration via n-doping, which could improve the performance of fresh devices but may result in perovskite degradation. Moreover, this study indicates a strategy for stabilizing perovskite by introducing a halide ion blocking ETL.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of PCBANBr and PCBANCl
To systematically study the halide anion–fullerene π interaction system, we synthesized fullerene ammonium salts, PCBANBr and PCBANCl (Scheme 1a), containing various halide ions that exist in perovskites by using the method for the preparation of PCBANI.19 To ensure the feasibility of the operation, we used ethyl bromide and propyl chloride as quaternization reagents. The structures of PCBANBr and PCBANCl were characterized using NMR, MALDI-TOF-MS, and elemental analysis.
Electronic and spatial structure studies

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey. 
XPS survey was used to explore the electronic structure and chemical state of the related elements in PCBANI, PCBANBr, and PCBANCl. For the halide ions in these corresponding fullerene ammonium salts, the binding energy increases by 0.26 eV for I 3d peaks (Fig. 2a), 0.26 eV for Br 3d peaks (Fig. 2b), and 0.75 eV for Cl 2p peaks (Fig. 2c), suggesting an electron-deficient environment around I−, Br−, and Cl− compared with that in their respective analogues, namely tetramethylammonium iodide (TMAI), tetramethylammonium bromide (TMAB) and tetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC, Scheme 1b). The significant increase in the binding energy for Cl− indicates that more electrons have transferred from Cl− to the fullerene core in PCBANCl than its two counterparts. These findings likely agree with the decreasing Lewis basicity Cl− > Br− > I−.49,50 In Fig. 2d the binding energy decreases by 0.27, 0.39, and 0.21 eV for C 1s peaks versus that in their semiconducting precursor PCBAN46 (Scheme 1c), demonstrating an electron-rich environment around fullerene's carbon. These relevant changes in the electronic structure of halide anions and the fullerene core indicate that an electron transferred from the anion to the fullerene core and demonstrate that fullerene is an overwhelmingly strong electron acceptor to initiate a doping process.

The binding energy scale was calibrated using the C 1s line (284.80 eV) from the carbon contamination. 


Electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical studies. 
Detailed electrochemical studies were successively performed to determine the electronic structures of PCBANBr and PCBANCl. Fig. S1† shows their cyclic voltammogram (CV) measured in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMIH) DMSO solution. Under electrolysis in the absence of the supporting electrolyte, BMIH, PCBANBr and PCBANCl are electroactive in DMSO aqueous solution, similar to PCBANI. Thus, the AgBr and AgCl precipitation method could be used to test the generation of Br− and Cl−. In a control experiment, AgBr and AgCl precipitations were observed when several drops of AgNO3 aqueous solution were added into the electrolyte solution (Fig. S2†). These results indicate that the partial oxidation of Br− and Cl− occurred due to n-doping and that Br− and Cl− dissolved in the solution during reduction.

In situ spectroelectrochemical investigation was subsequently performed to study the change in the electronic structure of the fullerene core under reduction. When PCBANBr and PCBANCl DMSO (anhydrous without oxygen) solutions were electrolyzed at −0.60 V vs. the SCE, an absorption peak at 1026 nm appeared, and this absorption peak is a characteristic of the NIR absorption of fullerene anion radicals (Fig. S3†).51 The absorption intensity increased as a function of time during the reduction. This finding reveals the formation of fullerene anion radicals during the reduction. Therefore, partial redox is reasonable and helpful for us to understand the structure and eventually propose an electron transport model for PCBANBr and PCBANCl.


Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study. 
To confirm the occurrence of self-n-doping, we conducted EPR measurements for PCBANBr and PCBANCl samples and the spectra were recorded (Fig. S4†). Paramagnetic signals were observed in the solution and films of the samples. Therefore, we concluded on the results of the XPS survey and electrochemical and EPR studies that the delocalization of valence electrons from the halide ion to the fullerene core resulted in the n-doping. Under reduction, the generation of pure halide ions (Br− and Cl−) and fullerene anion radicals agrees well with the changes in their chemical states.


Charge transport property study. 
Electron-only devices for PCBANI, PCBANBr, and PCBANCl with the structure ITO/TIPD/Film/Al (TIPD, and titanium (diisopropoxide) bis(2,4-pentanedionate)) were tested for the comparison of their electron conductivity. As shown in Fig. 3, at the same film thickness of 100 nm, the conductivity decreased successively from PCBANI to PCBANBr and to PCBANCl. This result indicates that the charge transport property is likely related to the size of halide ions.
 Fig. 3  
J–V characteristics of the electron-only devices of PCBANI, PCBANBr, and PCBANCl films. 
Thus, we conclude that the n-doping effect also exists in both PCBANBr and PCBANCl, in which partial electron transfer occurs from the halide ion to core fullerene followed by the formation of strong noncovalent anion–π interactions, which are weaker than covalent bonding,7,13,14 in which the halide ion shares valence electrons in the molecular orbital with core fullerene driven by the difference in electron affinity between the two counterparts. These findings demonstrate that fullerene is an overwhelmingly strong electron acceptor that activates relatively inert halide anions (Br− and Cl−) and initiates a doping process. On the basis of our proposed electron transport model,24 we attribute the decrease in the charge transport property to the reduced size of halide anions; smaller anions cannot be tightly sandwiched between fullerenes and they are not suitable for charge transport.

Computational modeling
To further understand the difference of the n-doping degree among the abovementioned fullerene ammonium halides, we performed quantum mechanics calculations by using Gaussian 03. The initial and final structures were proposed and fully optimized at the LanL2DZ pseudo-potential for iodine and bromine and at the 6-31G* level of theory for other elements. As an example, Fig. 4a shows the optimized structures of PCBANI with natural bond orbital (NBO) atomic charge distribution on each atom before and after n-doping, as well as the charge transfer from the halide ion to the fullerene core.
 Fig. 4  (a) PCBANX (X = I, Br and Cl): initial and final structures of the self-n-doping process. (b) PCBANI: structures by setting net charges as 0 e and −1 e for fullerene. 

Table 1 shows that the charge of halide anions decreases and charge transfer occurred from the halide anion to the fullerene during the self-n-doping. Charge transfer is highest in PCBANCl and lowest in PCBNAI. These results agree with the electrochemical and XPS data, in which the increased binding energy of PCBANCl is 0.75 eV, whereas those of PCBANI and PCBANBr are much lower (approximately 0.26 eV). This finding indicates that the higher the increase in binding energy, the higher the charges transfer. This relationship demonstrates that charge transfer is related to the radius of halide ions. A chlorine ion has the smallest radius; thus, it demonstrates the shortest separation from the fullerene core and shows the highest charge transfer.

Fig. 4b shows the optimized structure of PCBANI (as an example) with NBO atomic charge distribution on each atom with the net charges for fullerene set as 0 e and −1 e. It shows that both the separations from the fullerene core and the charges on fullerene increase. The energy of PCBANI decreases mostly during the process (Table 2), indicating that it is considerably easier for PCBANI to transport charge and to release the anion. This finding is consistent with the experimental result, showing that PCBANI has higher conductivity than PCBANBr and PCBANCl. As a result of the large radius and high deformability (related to polarizability) of iodide, the electron cloud of this anion tends to move from one fullerene to the neighbouring one. Thus, the radius and deformability of the anion play important roles in charge transfer.

Mechanism of halide ion migration in p–i–n Pero-SCs
Based on the properties of halide anion–fullerene π interactions, the mechanism of halide ion migration in the p–i–n Pero-SCs is studied. Methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) is the current benchmark for organic metal halide perovskites used in Pero-SCs. In p–i–n Pero-SCs, when iodide meets fullerene at the interface, intermolecular doping commonly occurs by forming iodide–fullerene π interactions, similar to the previously illustrated self-n-doping process. At the perovskite–fullerene interface, iodide anions are pushed close to PCBM under built-in potential (along with the strong oxidative potential of fullerene) to produce highly conductive n-doped PCBM, which facilitates the charge transport. This phenomenon is supported by the improvement in the performance (such as PCE, Jsc, and FF) of devices with reduced hysteresis, as reported in our study and in several literature studies.30–34,46 However, Wang et al. recently provided direct evidence for thermally derived and Ag cathode-induced ion diffusion through the PCBM ETL in Pero-SC devices.44 Although iodide–fullerene π interactions are weak, the slidable iodide dopant may further diffuse and dope the neighbouring fullerene if space and energy are favourable. Therefore, we speculate that the ability of iodide to slide along the fullerene surface and to hop to the neighbouring fullerene results in its significant migration and in the degradation of perovskite iodide, causing the decay of devices.
To further elucidate the migration of iodide within the PCBM layer, we resort to quantum mechanics calculations and verify that a surface with equipotential energy causes iodide to shift around the fullerene's lower hemisphere. We attempted to illustrate that iodide tends to move from one PCBM to another after its doping of the fullerene core. The iodide was placed in different positions in the hemisphere of PCBM for the calculation of the total energy of the molecule. The result shows that data on energy are approximately similar (within 2 kJ mol−1); thus, the hemisphere of PCBM could be considered an equipotential energy surface (Fig. 5). Moreover, the results indicate that the iodide tends to freely move on this equipotential energy surface, allowing the ion to move to a nearby PCBM.
 Fig. 5  Equipotential energy surface of PCBM. 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed to determine the distance between two fullerene cores of PCBM in its film, which was spin-coated from its chlorobenzene solution according to the procedure for device fabrication. Fig. 6 shows a strong peak at 2θ ≈ 9.2° corresponding to a spacing of 0.93 nm between the neighbouring fullerene molecules, which is approximately equal to the experimental results of Rispens et al.52 This information indicates that in most cases, two fullerene cores are approximately 1 nm apart, and this value could be used to set the distance between two fullerene cores for calculation.
 Fig. 6  XRD pattern of the PCBM film spin-coated from its chlorobenzene solution. 
Calculations involving the two PCBM molecules with an iodide were performed to illustrate that it is possible for iodide to move by overcoming the energy barrier. Fig. 7a shows the initial structure demonstrating that iodide is close to one PCBM molecule but away from another one and that the intermediate structure is demonstrated by the presence of iodide between the two PCBM molecules. The intermediate structure displays a low energy, where the distance between the two PCBM molecule surfaces decreases from 9.3–10 Å to 6.6–7 Å (according to the contact angle of the two molecules); additionally, the iodide is simultaneously located on the equipotential energy surfaces of the two PCBM molecules. Iodide stays away from one PCBM, moves toward the middle of a lower-energy site, and crosses the energy barrier to get closer to the other one, whose surface exhibits an equipotential energy. The energy of the entire system first decreases and then increases. The energy barrier is approximately 16 kJ mol−1 (Fig. 7b), which is approximately equivalent to the hydrogen bond strength if two water molecules in a liquid are H-bonded.53 This energy barrier is related to the angle of the initial structure of the two PCBM molecules. Thus, one can conclude that it is possible for iodide to migrate from one fullerene core to the neighbouring one.
 Fig. 7  (a) Iodide ion moves from one PCBM molecule to the neighbouring one. (b) Energy barrier for the iodide ion moving from one PCBM molecule to the neighbouring one. 
We consider two important factors, namely thermal energy and internal electric field, to cause the migration of iodide in the perovskite layer. On the one hand, Conings et al.42 and Wang et al.44 have observed that considerable decomposition occurs during the annealing of a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite at 85 °C. This process provides a thermal energy of approximately 4.47 kJ mol−1 (3/2 RT). On the other hand, for the contribution of an internal electric field, the open-circuit voltage of the device is approximately 1.1 V, and the thicknesses of the PCBM layer (d), perovskite layer, and hole transporting layer (HTL) are 25–30 nm (regarded as 30 nm), 250–300 nm (regarded as 300 nm), and 25–30 nm (regarded as 30 nm), respectively. In addition, the relative dielectric constants of the PCBM and perovskite are taken to be 4 and 32,54,55 respectively. We assume the dielectric constant of the HTL to be 16. Then, based on Maxwell's principle of an equal electric displacement vector,56 the voltage applied on the PCBM layer (V) is approximately 0.44 V. If the charge of iodide (q) is considered 1 e, the distance that the iodide has travelled from the middle position between the two PCBM molecules to the equipotential surface of one PCBM molecule (s) is approximately 0.3 nm. In this work, the work done by the electric field force during the process is expressed as follows: (1)where NA is the Avogadro constant. The result obtained is 0.42 kJ mol−1.
The above calculation shows that compared with the contribution of the thermal effect, that of the internal electric field is very small (<9%), indicating that the thermal effect is the major factor that determines iodide migration. Although the overall effects of the thermal and internal electric field reach 4.89 kJ mol−1, which remains considerably smaller than the energy barrier of 16 kJ mol−1, it provides the iodide with a certain probability (approximately 2.4%) to cross the barrier. As a result, it is possible but not very frequent for iodide to migrate from the fullerene core to the neighbouring one.
Based on the above studies, a schematic was drawn to illustrate the iodide migration pathway through the PCBM layer (Fig. 8). Iodide doping of PCBM at the interface initiates the process that improves contact and facilitates electron transport. Within randomly packed PCBM, it is crucial for iodide to hop from one fullerene to another within a desirable distance, taking advantage of its migration along the surface with equipotential energy. Otherwise, iodide would be sandwiched between PCBM and blocked by side chains in a narrow space to “stick to” the fullerene core. This mechanism is similar to the cooperative multi-ion hopping through aligned multiple anion–π sites, where π-acidic aromatics can be linked together to produce an unbendable scaffold with multiple binding sites, allowing anions to move across a lipid bilayer membrane.14 In electron transport, which depends on the linking of delocalized fullerene's π–π electron system, as long as the surrounding spherical fullerene cores are located within a desired distance, normally approximately 1 nm, electrons could be transferred between fullerenes and could not be hindered by side chains. Therefore, in the PCBM ETL, electron transport is considerably faster and easier than iodide migration. According to the above mechanism, a halide ion blocking electron-conductive interfacial layer should be introduced between the perovskite and PCBM layers to suppress ion migration.

The residue was dried in vacuo at room temperature for 48 h to give a brown solid, PCBANCl (217 g, yield 50%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, d6-DMSO, δ): 0.89 (s, 3H), 1.66 (s, 2H), 2.01 (s, 4H), 2.56 (s, 2H), 2.91 (s, 2H), 3.04 (s, 6H), 3.18–3.25 (m, 4H), 4.06 (s, 2H), 7.48–7.58 (m, 3H), 8.04 (s, 2H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, d6-DMSO, δ): 10.49, 15.35, 21.72, 32.84, 32.93, 48.53, 50.07, 52.20, 60.09, 60.95, 64.29, 80.23, 128.32, 128.39, 132.05, 136.26, 136.63, 137.65, 140.04, 140.24, 141.55, 141.63, 141.79, 142.40, 143.22, 143.27, 143.42, 143.76, 143.88, 144.20, 144.49, 144.62, 145.16, 145.81, 147.98, 149.21, 172.47. MALDI-TOF-MS: calcd for [C79H30NO2]+·Cl−, 1059.2, found [M − Cl]+, 1024.2.
XPS measurements
XPS measurements of the samples were carried out using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer. All spectra were recorded using a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.8 eV) X-ray radiation source at 180 W. The typical operating pressure was 2 × 10−7 Pa. The binding energy scale was calibrated using the C 1s line (284.6 eV) from the carbon contamination.
EPR measurements
EPR measurements were performed using an ESRA-300 electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer (Bruker Co.) at room temperature under nitrogen.
Fabrication of electron-only devices
ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned sequentially with detergent aqueous solution, acetone, deionized water, and absolute ethyl alcohol, each for 10 min. The cleaned substrates were then treated with air plasma for 10 min. After coating with TIPD, the PCBANI (or PCBANBr, PCBANCl) DMSO solution (200 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 3 min inside a glovebox. Finally, the devices were completed after the deposition of 100 nm Al as the electrode.
Computational modeling
Quantum mechanics calculations were performed with a hybrid B3LYP functional. The LanL2DZ pseudo-potential was chosen for iodide and the 6-31G* basis was employed for all other elements. Based on various experimental facts, the initial structures before and after self-n-doping were first guessed and then fully optimized. Frequency analyses were performed to confirm the resulting optimized stationary points. To show the quantity of the charge transport, atomic point charges were calculated with natural bond orbital (NBO) theory. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 03 program package.
Conclusions
In conclusion, systematic studies on self-n-doped fullerene ammonium halides containing I−, Br−, and Cl− were performed to elucidate the properties of halide anion–fullerene π interactions. Our findings show that fullerene is an overwhelmingly strong electron acceptor that activates inert halide anions. Moreover, this study demonstrates the universality of halide anion (I−, Br−, and Cl−) n-doping of fullerene; thereby, the conductivity of the fullerene derivatives can be increased. By contrast, the conductivity decreased successively from PCBANI to PCBANBr and to PCBANCl. On the basis of all the solid evidence combined with the computational results, we conclude that the size of halide anions is a crucial factor that determines the electron transport property of fullerene ammonium salts. Moreover, the results could explain the mechanism of halide ion migration in the p–i–n Pero-SCs consisting of the methylammonium lead halide perovskite CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br, and Cl) absorber and fullerene (i.e., C60 and PCBM) electron transport layer. Taking MAPbI3 Pero-SC as an example, based on the n-doping mechanism resulting from halide anion–fullerene π interactions combined with the computational results, we propose a plausible pathway and mechanism for iodide migration from perovskites to the cathode through the fullerene ETL. At the perovskite–fullerene interface, iodide doping of fullerene could improve device performance. However, for weak iodide–fullerene π interactions, the slidable iodide could further dope a neighbouring fullerene if space and energy are favourable, resulting in perovskite degradation and ultimately causing decay of the device. This work highlights the importance of halide anion–fullerene π interactions and indicates that the introduction of a halide ion blocking electron-conductive interfacial layer between perovskites and PCBM layers is important to suppress ion migration. Subsequent development of this kind of ETL material is underway.
