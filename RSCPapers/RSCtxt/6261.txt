    , Accepted 21st April 2020First published on 22nd April 2020Abstractβ-Carotene (bCar) is a natural organic semiconductor that photo-degrades within a few minutes when exposed to sunlight in ambient conditions and that can be employed as electron donor in organic solar cell (OSC) active layers. Its fast photo-degradation kinetics make bCar an ideal molecule to study strategies to improve the durability of OSCs. Mixing bCar with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) in a 1:4 ratio considerably delays the bCar photo-bleaching to produce thin films that are relatively stable when exposed to sunlight for more than an hour. Furthermore, when coated with OSC top electrodes, these active layers exhibit an even stronger resistance again photo-oxidation. Despite the easily photo-oxidized nature of bCar, the resulting bCar:PC71BM OSCs maintain their photovoltaic performances for over 6 months without additional encapsulation and display high thermal stability. In fact, the binary bCar:PC71BM active layers with a large relative concentration of PC71BM exhibit a longer operational stability than reference air-stable active layers in the organic photovoltaic field, namely, poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-dithienylbenzothiadiazole):PC71BM active layers prepared with the same electron donor to PC71BM ratio (1:4). The superior durability of bCar OSCs compared to PCDTBT ones can be ascribed to their higher morphological stability which is associated with lower mixing energies in small molecule:fullerene systems with respect to polymer:fullerene ones. Our results thus indicate that small molecule donors combined with PC71BM into active layers have a high potential to produce OSCs that simultaneously achieve high power conversion efficiencies and durability.
Introduction
As they can be fabricated through low-cost and low carbon footprint solution processes, organic solar cells (OSCs) demonstrate a much higher potential than silicon photovoltaics when it comes to energy return on investment provided that long-term operational stability can be achieved.1 Although the record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs are now over 16%,2,3 efficient strategies to achieve long-term operational stability are still lacking. The best performing fullerene acceptor based OSCs have lower PCEs than those employing non-fullerene acceptors,4–6 but fullerene acceptors such as [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) demonstrate a much higher resistance against photo-oxidation leading to long device lifetimes in conjugated polymer:PC71BM OSCs.7–9 Among these conjugated polymer:PC71BM active layers, poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-dithienylbenzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT):PC71BM thin films have shown long-lasting performances, even without encapsulation.8,9 The durability of OSCs is essentially limited by two main factors. The first issue is associated with the loss of optical properties (bleaching) of organic semiconductors resulting from their photo-oxidation. In addition to these intrinsic properties, when electron donors and electron acceptors are spin-coated into bulk heterojunction active layers, the resulting thin films are in an unstable kinetic state. Over time, such bulk heterojunctions may evolve into a more thermodynamically stable phase-separated state. Therefore, as charge separation occurs at the donor/acceptor interface in OSC active layers, developing binary thin films with high morphological stability is an essential step to translate towards durable OSC fabrication.
According to derivations of the Flory-Huggins theory, the molecular weights of blended materials strongly influence the mixing energy of binary thin films.10 Longer molecules will produce larger Gibbs free energy of mixing, leading to bigger phase separated domains. Although several studies have demonstrated that small molecule electron donors can produce OSCs with PCEs above 11%,11 there has been no report on small molecule OSCs that exhibit long-term operational stability up to date. Previous studies suggest that PC71BM molecules have relatively low oxygen reactivity and that they could considerably limit the diffusion of oxygen into the OSC active layer.12 The lack of durability previously measured in small molecule OSCs may thus be a consequence of the low PC71BM concentrations in their active layers.13
Recently, we fabricated OSCs using β-carotene (bCar), a natural electron donor that is well-known for its fast photo-degradation kinetics when exposed to sunlight in the presence of oxygen.14–18 Despite the relatively low photovoltaic performances of bCar OSCs, the rapid photo-oxidation kinetics of bCar make it an ideal model molecule to study the impact of PC71BM concentration on OSC durability. In fact, in the study presented here, we investigate the impact of the relative PC71BM concentration in binary bCar:PC71BM active layers on the photo-degradation kinetics of bCar present in these thin films. The adequate PC71BM content in the binary thin films combined with the oxygen barrier molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) hole conducting layer functions as efficient in situ encapsulation for bCar:PC71BM active layers in inverted OSC architectures. As a result, the bCar:PC71BM OSCs exhibit stable operation for more than 6 months without additional encapsulation. The bCar:PC71BM OSCs also exhibit high thermal stability up to 100 °C. We compare the durability of the bCar:PC71BM OSCs with that of the reference PCDTBT:PC71BM OSCs to further elucidate the impact of morphological stability on the durability of OSCs.
Experimental details
bCar, PCDTBT and all the solvents employed for the thin film and device fabrication were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich, while PC71BM, MoO3 and silver (Ag) were purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp. Glass substrates covered with indium tin oxide (ITO) purchased from Atsugi Micro were cleaned with acetone, surfactant, isopropanol and hot isopropanol before spin-coating a zinc oxide (ZnO) precursor solution composed of 500 mg ZnOAc·H2O and 101.4 mg 2-aminoethanol in 5 ml of 2-methoxyethanol at 3000 rpm for 40 s. The precursor layer was converted into ZnO by annealing the substrates at 200 °C for 30 min followed by slow cooling back to room temperature. 30 nm thick active layers were deposited from chlorobenzene solutions with a concentration of 37.5 mg ml−1 on the ITO/ZnO substrates with bCar:PC71BM ratios of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4. For PCDTBT:PC71BM active layers fabrication, the concentration for the 1:4 blends in dichlorobenzene was 20 mg ml−1 and 60 nm thick active layers were deposited at a spin-coating speed of 2000 rpm. The concentrations and spin-coating speeds of bCar, PC71BM and PCDTBT only films were adjusted to produce films with similar thicknesses around 30 nm.
100 μl of epoxy resin (Ossila Ltd) and a cover glass were employed to encapsulate some spin-coated bCar films. The stack was then exposed to ultraviolet curing at 254 nm for 10 min. To finalize the OSCs, 10 nm of MoO3 and 65 nm of Ag were thermally evaporated on top of the active layers after leaving the substrates in high vacuum overnight to ensure complete removal of the solvent.
The long-term operational stability or shelf-life of the OSCs was characterized by measuring their photovoltaic properties at regular intervals up to 180 days (6 months). On each measurement day, the J–V characteristics of the OSCs were measured using a Keithley 2401 source meter for 3 hours of continuous irradiation conditions under 1 sun (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). The initial average PCEs for bCar:PC71BM (1:4) and PCDTBT:PC71BM (1:4) are 0.62% and 6.1%, respectively. The absorption spectra of the thin films or multilayers deposited onto glass/ITO/ZnO substrates were measured after exposure to the solar simulator (1 sun) for 0, 3, 10, 60 and 1440 min. The absorption spectra were measured using a Xenon lamp (L2175) and a photonic multichannel spectral analyzer (PMA-11) from Hamamatsu Photonics. To reflect the OSC conditions and ensure that enough light is transmitted through the sample, 10 nm of MoO3 and 15 nm of Ag were deposited onto ITO/ZnO/bCar:PC71BM multilayers and characterized following the same procedure. Thermal stability of the active layers was assessed by annealing the OSCs at 75 °C, 100 °C or 125 °C for 10 min and measuring the J–V characteristics, photoluminescence properties and nanomorphology of the resulting active layers. Solid-state photoluminescence was measured with a JASCO FP-6500 spectrofluorometer using excitation wavelengths of 450 nm and 580 nm for PCDTBT:PC71BM and bCar:PC71BM thin films, respectively. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were collected in tapping mode under ambient conditions.
Results and discussion
Although bCar can be found in several natural systems, it is well known for its fast degradation kinetics when exposed to light in the presence of oxygen.14–18 In fact, the absorbance spectra of bCar clearly indicate that upon exposure to simulated sunlight (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), complete photo-bleaching of bCar occurs within 10 min (Fig. 1(a)). On the other hand, PC71BM exhibits no photo-bleaching when continuously exposed to simulated sunlight for 24 h (Fig. 1(b)). We observed a slight increase in PC71BM absorption at exposure times above 1 h which can be ascribed to PC71BM dimerization or de-dimerization resulting from an annealing-like effect in fullerene films exposed for long times.19

The absorption spectra presented in Fig. 1 and the corresponding photographs (Fig. S1, ESI†) clearly indicate that adding PC71BM to bCar thin films considerably reduces the photo-bleaching of the natural organic semiconductor. After 24 h of exposure to simulated sunlight, complete photo-bleaching of bCar occurs in all films independently of their PC71BM contents. Therefore, the absorption of thin films exposed for 24 h can be ascribed to PC71BM. We used the absorbance after 24 h as baseline for the calculations of bCar degradation (Table 1). The summarized data in Table 1 reveals that an increasing amount of PC71BM in the bCar:PC71BM blends considerably delays the photo-bleaching of bCar. In bCar only thin films, complete photo-bleaching can be observed within 10 min. For the same period of light exposure, the blends with 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4 bCar:PC71BM ratios only exhibit 21.2%, 14.8% and 9.4% of photo-bleaching, respectively. In the 1:4 blends, the photo-bleaching rate is also considerably lower than other films at longer exposure times.

Note that these photo-bleaching rates remain much higher than those of PCDTBT and PCDTBT:PC71BM thin films (Fig. S2, ESI†). In fact, the latter only displays a minor decrease in absorption after 24 h of constant exposure under light irradiation. Despite such highly stable behavior against photo-oxidation, PCDTBT:PC71BM (1:4) OSCs exhibit a much stronger initial burn-in effect than bCar:PC71BM OSCs prepared with the same donor:acceptor ratio (Fig. 2(a)).
 Fig. 2  (a) Evolution of the PCE of bCar:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM OSCs measured under constant irradiation; (b) evolution of the photovoltaic parameters of bCar:PC71BM OSCs under constant irradiation. 
The PCE of PCDTBT OSCs is reduced to 90% of its initial value within 15 min, which is consistent with results presented in previous reports and mainly caused by a drop in open-circuit voltage (Voc).20,21 A similar drop in Voc can be observed for the bCar:PC71BM devices which is compensated by mild increases in short-circuit current densities (Jsc) and fill factors (FF) during the first measurement hour. As the Jsc and FF of PCDTBT:PC71BM OSCs fabricated with the same device architecture do not increase, we can remove the hypothesis that such behavior in the bCar:PC71BM OSCs is a result of the light-soaking effect often found in inverted OSC architectures employing metal oxides as bottom cathodes.22–25
Light absorbed by the active layer is usually not entirely converted into photocurrent. Therefore, a significant amount of the incoming energy is transformed into heat, resulting in a low temperature annealing-like effect which could explain the mild increase in Jsc and FF of the bCar:PC71BM OSCs. Annealing at higher temperatures may induces morphological changes within the active layer and is generally associated with a decrease of Jsc in polymer:PC71BM OSCs as large phase separation reduces the amount of donor/acceptor interface.26Table 2 summarizes the decreases in Jsc observed for bCar:PC71BM or PCDTBT:PC71BM OSCs annealed at various temperatures for 10 min.

Although minor decreases can be observed for both OSCs for a low annealing temperature of 75 °C, the differences between the two devices become larger with increasing temperatures above 100 °C. According to previous studies, crystallizations of bCar, PCDTBT and PC71BM start around 90 °C, 140 °C and 180 °C, respectively.27–30 Therefore, the only significant crystalline transformation in the range of temperature studied here corresponds to that of bCar. Nevertheless, the AFM images in Fig. S3 (ESI†) indicate that only minor morphological changes can be observed upon annealing the bCar:PC71BM active layers at 100 °C and 125 °C. On the other hand, despite the higher crystallization temperature of PCDTBT, clear changes attributed to phase separation are seen in the morphology of PCDTBT:PC71BM films upon annealing at 100 °C. By increasing the annealing temperature to 125 °C, even larger phase-separated domains appear. Note that, as PCDTBT only exhibit weak crystallization even at 160 °C, we can safely assume that the changes in PCDTBT:PC71BM morphology are unrelated to the crystallization behavior of the active materials. The evolution of the bCar:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM active layer morphologies is consistent with the photoluminescence spectra measured from the two blends (Fig. 3). The photoluminescence from bCar:PC71BM thin films exhibits almost no annealing temperature dependence. On the other hand, photoluminescence from the PCDTBT:PC71BM gradually increases especially for annealing temperatures above 100 °C. Assuming that the two donor/acceptor combinations have similar interaction parameters, our results correlate well with the expected higher thermodynamic stability of small molecule active layers with respect to those employing a polymer electron donor. Note that the Jsc decrease at 125 °C may also be in part due to the deterioration of the active layer/MoO3 interface.31 However, the resistance of bCar:PC71BM (1:4) thin films towards thermal annealing is not sufficient to explain the constant Jsc measured for bCar:PC71BM OSCs under constant exposure to simulated sunlight for 24 h. In fact, complete photo-bleaching of bCar can be observed in bCar:PC71BM (1:4) thin films after 24 h of exposure (Fig. 1(e)).
 Fig. 3  Photoluminescence spectra of (a) bCar:PC71BM and (b) PCDTBT:PC71BM thin films at room temperature (RT) and annealed at 75 °C, 100 °C and 125 °C for 10 min. 
When coated with MoO3 and Ag, the bCar:PC71BM thin films exhibit a much higher resistance towards photo-oxidation (Fig. 4(a)). Note that the data in Fig. 4(a) does not correspond strictly to the absorbance and that part of the light is reflected by the MoO3/Ag electrodes. Additionally, as MoO3/Ag electrode do not transmit light uniformly, some spectral differences are found between the bare and coated bCar:PC71BM absorbance (Fig. 4(b)). Similarly to PC71BM-only thin films (Fig. 1(b)), the coated bCar:PC71BM exhibit a small increase in absorbance which is likely caused by light-induced rearrangement of PC71BM. Such rearrangement could also promote charge transport and would thus be consistent with the initial increase in Jsc and FF observed for the constant irradiation J–V measurement (Fig. 2(b)). These results also correlate well with past studies in which MoO3 prevented oxygen or moisture related degradation in both regular and inverted OSCs.32–35 In fact, the combined in situ encapsulation of bCar by PC71BM and MoO3 seems to yield similar photo-degradation kinetics as bCar thin films characterized in the absence of oxygen (Fig. S4, ESI†).

To ensure efficient in situ encapsulation by PC71BM and MoO3, it is thus important to avoid spinodal decomposition in the binary active layers as this may cause undesired burn-in effects.36 As PCDTBT:PC71BM active layers are more likely to demix than bCar:PC71BM films, a longer shelf-life can be expected from bCar:PC71BM OSCs. The PCDTBT:PC71BM OSCs maintain high photovoltaic performances for 3 months with less than 10% decrease in average PCE compared to the initial value for unencapsulated devices kept in the dark in ambient conditions (Fig. 5). After 4 months, the PCDTBT:PC71BM OSCs start degrading faster and a 30% decrease in PCE can be observed after 6 months of measurement.
 Fig. 5  Evolution of the PCE of unencapsulated bCar:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM OSCs kept in the dark under ambient conditions. 
In comparison, the bCar:PC71BM OSCs display PCE values between 3% and 15% higher than the PCE measured in fresh OSCs for the same 6 months measurement period. This peculiar behavior is in complete contrast with the fast photo-bleaching kinetics of bCar molecules when exposed to simulated sunlight in the presence of oxygen. A schematic representation that explains the enhanced stability of bCar OSCs with respect to PCDTBT ones can be found in Fig. 6. The low oxygen reactivity PC71BM molecules and the MoO3 layer form barriers that impede the diffusion of oxygen into the active layer. As photo-degradation of bCar originates from reactions with oxygen, such combined in situ encapsulation completely removes the necessity for additional encapsulation with epoxy resins and/or cover glasses. Protection against oxidation can similarly be found in the PCDTBT OSCs. However, due to their lower morphological stability, PCDTBT:PC71BM active layers phase separate more easily which leads to a faster drop in photovoltaic performances for PCDTBT OSCs with respect to bCar ones, in particular when phase separation leaves some oxygen-sensitive PCDTBT-rich sites exposed to air.
 Fig. 6  Schematic representation of the prevention against photo-oxidation by in situ encapsulation of inverted OSC active layers containing a high concentration of PC71BM and of the appearance of O2 sensitive sites due to phase separation in aged PCDTBT:PC71BM active layers. 
As Ag electrodes are prone to oxidation in the long term, the shelf-life of MoO3-coated bCar:PC71BM could not be measured for periods longer than 7 months. We should mention here that semi-transparent OSCs prepared with a 15 nm thick Ag electrode only demonstrate stable operation for up to 2 months, which strongly suggests that the failure mechanism of bCar:PC71BM after 7 months is due to oxidation of the metal layer. Replacing Ag with gold or using thicker Ag layers could yield even longer shelf-lives but this is outside the scope of this study.
Conclusions
Unlike bCar thin films that completely photo-bleach in air within 10 min, bCar:PC71BM active layers with a 1:4 donor:acceptor ratio maintain their optical properties for hours. This drastic change in photo-degradation kinetics results from the low oxygen reactivity of PC71BM molecules and their capacity to block the diffusion of oxygen inside the active layers. In inverted OSC architectures, the metal oxide layers provide an additional in situ encapsulation that promotes long-term stability. As a result, inverted bCar:PC71BM OSCs exhibit no major drops in PCE when exposed to sunlight for up to 6 h and the photovoltaic performances of bCar:PC71BM OSCs are maintained for periods exceeding 6 months when kept in air under dark conditions between measurements. To produce these highly stable photovoltaic performances, no additional encapsulation step was necessary after deposition of the metal electrodes. Our results thus suggest that in situ encapsulation by PC71BM and MoO3 could considerably facilitate the manufacturing of stable OSCs.
Furthermore, the durability of OSCs containing the highly oxygen-sensitive bCar is even higher than that of PCDTBT:PC71BM ones, which are often considered as references when it comes to stability issues in the OSC field. Unlike bCar:PC71BM active layers that exhibit minor morphological changes upon accelerated aging experiments at 100 °C and 125 °C, PCDTBT and PC71BM phase separate into large domains despite the amorphous nature of the two materials in the studied range of temperatures. When combined with fullerene derivatives, long macromolecules can be expected to phase separate into larger domains compared to small molecules or oligomers. The formation of larger phase separated domains in the PCDTBT:PC71BM active layers likely induces the appearance of exposed oxygen sensitive sites in the OSCs which considerably accelerates the degradation of the polymer-based OSCs (Fig. 6). Our findings thus suggest that developing methods to minimize the Gibbs free energy of mixing of donor/acceptor systems could be an efficient strategy to produce long-lasting OSCs.
Compared to polymer donors, small molecule donors have a higher potential to reduce the mixing energy and produce active layers with stable morphologies. Taking these aspects into consideration, we expect that the results we reported here will inspire future studies related to small molecule-based OSCs with high PC71BM concentrations that can simultaneously achieve high PCEs and durability.
