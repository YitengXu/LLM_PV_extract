    , Accepted 14th March 2016First published on 15th March 2016AbstractA series of novel electron-donating building blocks of alkyltriazolyl substituted benzodithiophene were synthesized on the basis of Cu(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition. The alternating donor–acceptor type of π-conjugated copolymers by using such alkyltriazolyl substituted benzodithiophene as donor units and diketopyrrolopyrrole as acceptor units were synthesized via Suzuki polymerization. The resultant copolymers exhibited good thermal properties and can be easily dissolved in various organic solvents. All copolymers show quite comparable absorption profiles in the range of 300–850 nm with the absorption onset at about 1.4 eV, where the copolymer with longer side chains exhibited a slightly enhanced absorption coefficient. The cyclic voltammetry measurements indicated the highest occupied molecular orbitals and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals located at about −5.40 and −3.40 eV, respectively, which were nearly independent of the size of alkyl side chains. Polymer solar cells based on the resultant copolymers as electron-donating materials and PC71BM as the electron-accepting material exhibited moderate photovoltaic performances.
1. Introduction
Due to the unique advantages of light weight, low cost, solution processing, and potential fabrication of flexible devices, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much interest from both academic and industrial communities.1–7 A typical photoactive layer of PSCs consists of the physical blends of electron-donating semiconducting polymers and electron-accepting fullerene derivatives to form bulk-heterojunction structures, which can allow for efficient charge separation and transport in bi-continuous percolated systems. Recent progress in electron-donating semiconducting polymers enables the rapid development of the donor–acceptor (D–A) type of narrow band-gap conjugated polymers.8–21 In this D–A type of conjugated polymer, the electron-rich unit (donor, D) and the electron-deficient unit (acceptor, A) were alternately conjugated along the polymer backbone, where the hybridization of molecular orbitals can result in a comparatively narrow band-gap. Of particular interest is their easily tunable band gaps and energy levels by controlling the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effects between the donor and acceptor moieties.22
Among the various reported D–A type of conjugated polymers, benzodithiophene (BDT) as the D unit has been extensively used and has been proved to be one of the most promising donor units for high-performance PSC materials.23–27 Early reports demonstrated that conjugated polymers based on BDT can attain an impressive hole mobility of 0.25 cm2 V−1 S−1, as measured by organic field effect transistors.28,29 Recently, a range of D–A type of conjugated polymers have been developed and have exhibited impressive photovoltaic performances. It was realized that by replacing the alkoxyl substituents with the 2-(2-ethylhexyl)thienyl moiety, the resulting BDT derivatives can lead to an obviously enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs.30–32 For instance, Hou et al. reported that the copolymers based on the incorporation of an alkylthiol-substituted BDT unit as the D unit and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene as the A unit lead to a comparatively high PCE of 9.4%, which can be further improved to about 10% by using solvent additives.33,34 These findings indicated the great potential of BDT derivatives.
It is well-established that “Click chemistry” has been extensively applied to develop new materials for drug delivery, biomacromolecules, sensors, and optoelectronic materials, due to their specific advantages of high stereo- and regio-selectivity with excellent yields under mild reaction conditions.35–39 As an effective “Click” reaction, the one-pot synthesis of Cu(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuIAAC) has been widely used for the reaction of alkynyl groups and azide compounds to produce triazole derivatives. With the motivation of developing novel BDT derivatives, we herein designed the alkyltriazolyl substituted BDT unit, namely TzBDT, which can be synthesized from the precursors of the alkynyl-substituted BDT unit through the CuIAAC approach. The geometry optimization of the TzBDT moiety and its counterpart of a thiophene-substituted BDT unit (ThBDT) with two methyl groups is carried out using the Gaussian 09 package40 at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory (Fig. 1). It was noted that the triazole unit exhibited smaller dihedral angles of about 24.9° than that of 51.7°, indicating stronger intermolecular stacking of TzBDT based copolymers. In addition, the proposed alkyltriazolyl substituted BDT unit can also affect the electronic structures of the BDT unit owing to the electron-deficient properties of the triazole moiety. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the BDT unit consisting of these electron-deficient substituents. Detailed synthesis, photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic performances will be introduced.

2. Experimental
2.1. Measurement and characterization

1H and 13C NMR were characterized using a Bruker AVANCE 500 MHz spectrometer in deuterated chloroform solution at 298 K. Chemical shifts were reported as the δ value (ppm) relative to an internal standard of tetramethylsilane (TMS). MALDI-TOF-MS was measured on a Bruker BIFLEXIII. Number-average (Mn) and weight-average (Mw) molecular weights were determined by using a Waters GPC 2410 in THF and a calibration curve with standard polystyrene as a reference. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a Netzsch TG 209 in nitrogen at heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a Netzsch DSC 204 under nitrogen flow at heating and cooling rates of 10 °C min−1. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a HP 8453 spectrophotometer. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were conducted on a CHI600D electrochemical workstation with a platinum working electrode and a Pt wire counter electrode at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1 against an Ag/Ag+ (0.1 M of AgNO3 in acetonitrile) reference electrode with a nitrogen saturated anhydrous solution of 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in acetonitrile. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out using a Digital Instrumental DI Multimode Nanoscope IIIa in the tapping mode.
2.2. Device fabrication and characterization
Before fabrication of the device, indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in deionized water, acetone, isopropyl alcohol and dried in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h before used. Then, the ITO substrates were transferred into a nitrogen protected glovebox where H2O concentration is ≤0.5 ppm and O2 concentration is ≤20 ppm. Differing from the conventional device configuration, inverted polymer solar cells were fabricated with the structure of the ITO/PFN-OX/copolymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Al under conditions as follows: the cross-linkable polymer poly[9,9-bis(6′-(N,N-diethylamino)hexyl)-fluorene-alt-9,9-bis(3-ethyl(oxetane-3-ethyloxy)-hexyl)-fluorene] (PFN-OX) was spin-coated on precleaned ITO substrates to form an about 5 nm thin film, and then the cross-linking process was carried out by heating the half-dried films at 150 °C and under fluorescence lamp illumination for 20 min.47,48 The copolymers and PC71BM were co-dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) in the weight ratios of 1:2 and typical concentration of the copolymer/PC71BM blending solution used in this study was 10 mg mL−1. All active layers were then spin-coated from the prepared blending solutions with a thickness of 90 nm. To complete the device fabrication, 10 nm of MoO3 and 100 nm of Al were thermally evaporated onto the active layer to form the top electrode of the device subsequently. The effective device area was measured to be 0.16 cm2 by the shadow mask.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were investigated using a Keithley 236 source meter. The spectral responses were measured using a commercial photomodulation spectroscopic setup (Oriel). A calibrated Si photodiode was used to determine the photosensitivity.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of the monomers and copolymers are outlined in Scheme 1. The compounds 2,6-dibromobenzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (M1) and 2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-bis[5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxoborolan-2-yl)thiophene-2-yl]-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (M5) were prepared according to the reported procedures.41,42 By treating compound M1 with n-butyl-lithium at −78 °C followed by tin(II) chloride at the ambient temperature, compound 2,6-dibromobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-diyl-bis(ethyne-2,1-diyl)-bis(trimethylsilane) (M2) was obtained in a good yield of 80%. A series of azido-alkanes 5-(azidomethyl)undecane (M3a), 7-(azidomethyl)pentadecane (M3b) and 9-(azidomethyl)octadecane (M3c) were synthesized by treating alkyl-bromide compounds with sodium azide in nearly quantitative yields. The target monomers 4,4′-(2,6-dibromobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-diyl)bis(1-(2-butyloctyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole) (M4a), 4,4′-(2,6-dibromobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-diyl)bis(1-(2-hexyldecyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole) (M4b) and 4,4′-(2,6-dibromobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-diyl)bis(1-(2-octyldodecyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole) (M4c) can be synthesized on the basis of Cu(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuIAAC) by using M2 and M3a–c as the starting materials. It is worth mentioning that the “Click” reaction of CuIAAC is remarkably efficient, which gives the target 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole products (M4a–c) in excellent yields (>90%) with nearly quantitative regioselectivity as indicated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. To our knowledge, it is the first report on the BDT unit consisting of these electron-deficient substituents. The molecular structures of all intermediates and monomers were confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (see Fig. S3–S14 in the ESI†).
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of monomers and copolymers. 
The target copolymers P1, P2 and P3 were afforded in good yields through palladium-catalyzed Suzuki polymerization of M5 with M4a, M4b and M4c, respectively. All resultant copolymers were purified by sequential Soxhlet extraction with acetone, hexane, and chloroform, and gave the target copolymers as dark solids. The number average molecular weights (Mn) of the copolymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in THF using polystyrene as a standard, which was estimated to be 24.5, 25.4 and 11.5 kg mol−1 for P1, P2 and P3, respectively with the polydispersity index (PDI) in the range of 1.4–1.8 (Table 1).

3.2. Thermal properties
Thermal properties of the copolymers were evaluated by differential scanning chromatography (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). From TGA measurements we note that all copolymers have good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) higher than 310 °C (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). No distinct thermal transition feature can be observed in the scanning range of 30–250 °C in DSC measurements (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). Detailed thermal analysis data are summarized in Table 1.
3.3. Photophysical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of these copolymers were recorded both in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution and as thin solid films (Fig. 2). All copolymers show quite comparable absorption profiles with dual characteristics both in THF solutions and as thin films, indicating the trivial effect of the length of alkyl side chains in the TzBDT unit on the absorbance. The absorption peak at a short wavelength of about 420 nm can be attributed to the π–π* transition of their conjugated backbone, while the absorption peaks at a long wavelength of about 700 nm can be correlated to the strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction between the TzBDT unit and the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) unit.43 The copolymer films show a maximum absorption coefficient of 2.8 × 104 cm−1, 3.2 × 104 cm−1 and 3.3 × 104 cm−1 for P1, P2 and P3, respectively. It was realized that copolymers P2 and P3 with a longer alkyl side chain in the TzBDT unit exhibited a slightly higher absorption coefficient. Moreover, it was found that the absorption spectrum of P3 in solid thin films has a stronger shoulder peak at ∼750 nm than those of P1 and P2, indicating a good intermolecular π–π stacking of P3. All copolymers exhibited nearly identical onsets (Fig. 2b), with the corresponding optical bandgap of around 1.4 eV. However, the optical bandgap of these copolymers is slightly lower than the PBDTT-DPP44 polymer consisting of a thienyl substituted BDT unit. The slightly bathochromic shift in absorption may stem from the HOMO-coupling of the DPP unit, which has also been realized in various DPP-based copolymer systems,45,51 the variation of the electron-donating capability of the TzBDT unit, or intermolecular interaction that results in different packing motifs. Detailed optical properties data are summarized in Table 2.

3.4. Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were used to evaluate the frontier molecular energy levels of these copolymers. The CV characteristics of copolymers as shown in Fig. 3 were recorded by using tetra(n-butyl)ammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M in acetonitrile) as the supporting electrolyte, a platinum button working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode and a Ag/Ag+ (0.1 M of AgNO3 in acetonitrile) reference electrode. All measurements were carried out under the inert atmosphere. The potential of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was used as the standard. The potential of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple was measured at 0.30 V relative to the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. Thus, the highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels (EHOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels (ELUMO) of these copolymers were calculated according to the following equation:EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.50) (eV);ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.50) (eV).where Eox and Ered are the onsets of oxidation and reduction, respectively. It was recorded that the recorded Eox was about 0.91 V for copolymers P1 and P2, and 0.90 eV for P3, thus the calculated EHOMO was about −5.41 eV for copolymers P1 and P2, and −5.40 eV for P3. In addition, the recorded Ered was −1.10, −1.14 and −1.08 V, thus the calculated ELUMO was −3.40, −3.36 and −3.42 eV for P1, P2 and P3, respectively. These findings indicated that the size of side chains in the TzBDT unit did not lead to significant differences in energy band gaps. We also noted that the EHOMO of these copolymers was slightly lower than that of about −5.30 eV for the counterparts consisting of the thienyl substituted BDT unit.43 The fact is understandable since the existence of the electron-withdrawing nitrogen on the imine (CN) bond in the triazole ring can effectively decrease the electron density. In contrast, the EHOMO of the alkylthiazolyl substituted BDT polymer is −5.18 eV,46 which is higher than the thienyl substituted copolymer PBDTT-DPP (EHOMO = −5.30 eV),43 and also higher than our current polymers P1–P3 (EHOMO ≈ −5.40 eV). Nonetheless, the relatively deep EHOMO indicated good oxidation stability of the resultant copolymers. The corresponding electrochemical data were summarized in Table 2.

3.5. Photovoltaic properties
In order to investigate the photovoltaic performances of the three new copolymers, polymer solar cells with an inverted structure of the ITO/PFN-OX/copolymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Al were fabricated. A thin layer of poly[9,9-bis(6′-(N,N-diethylamino)hexyl)fluorene-alt-9,9-bis(3-ethyl(oxetane-3-ethyloxy)hexyl)fluorene] (PFN-OX) was used as the interlayer because it has been proved to be an effective interlayer that can facilitate electron collection.47,48 The photoactive layers were fabricated by spin-coating the blend chlorobenzene solutions of the :PC71BM polymer with an optimized weight ratios of 1:2, and the solution consisting of the solvent additive of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO, 3 v/v%). The current density as a function of voltage (J–V) curves of these copolymers are shown in Fig. 4 and detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 3.

All photovoltaic devices based on these copolymers exhibited quite comparable open circuit voltages (VOC) of about 0.7 V, which is in good accordance with the analoguous EHOMO energy levels of these copolymers.49 Despite the slightly lower EHOMO of the resulting copolymers, the VOC is comparable with the polymer counterpart based on the BDT unit. The devices based on P1:PC71BM exhibited a relatively low device performance of 0.33%, with a VOC of 0.72 V, a short circuit current (JSC) of 1.75 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.26. Devices based on copolymer P2, which has a slightly longer alkyl side chain of the TzBDT unit, exhibited a slightly increased JSC of 2.43 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.54, and a moderate PCE of 0.94%. Devices based on copolymer P3, which has the longest alkyl side chain of the TzBDT unit, resulted in the slightly improved JSC of 2.58 mA cm−2 and a slightly improved PCE of 1.01%. We note that the PCEs of the resulting polymers are much lower than those of about 6% as obtained from polymer counterparts based on the BDT unit consisting of alkylthiophene as the substituents,43 primarily in terms of lower JSC and FF, which might be correlated to the inefficient charge separation or unfavorable nanoscale phase separation in the photoactive layer.
3.6. Hole mobility
To investigate the effects of side chains in the TzBDT unit on the hole mobility of the resultant copolymers, hole-only devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PFN-OX/copolymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Al. The weight ratio of copolymer:PC71BM was 1:2 and the films were fabricated under exactly the same conditions as those for polymer solar cells. The hole mobility was determined by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. From the plots of J1/2versus V as shown in Fig. 5, hole mobilities of the resultant copolymers were calculated on the basis of the following equation:  where J is current, μh is the hole mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the permittivity of the material, d is the thickness of the active layer, and V is the voltage drop across the device. V = Vappl − Vrs − Vbi, where V is the effective voltage, Vappl is the applied voltage, Vrs is the voltage drop, and Vbi is the build-in voltage. The calculated hole mobilities of the copolymers are shown in Table 2. The calculated hole mobilities of the copolymers P1, P2 and P3 were 2.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. It was found that the hole mobilities for copolymers P2 and P3 are about one order of magnitude higher than P1, illustrating that the TzBDT unit with longer side chains can be more favourable for charge carrier transportation. Nevertheless, the hole mobilities of the resulting copolymers were 0.27 × 10−4–1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 which are much lower than the reported polymer PBDTT-DPP (μhole = 2.35 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1).50 Note that this mobility of PBDTT-DPP is measured based on pure polymer films,50 while the hole mobility in the current work is measured on the basis of polymer:PC71BM blend films.

3.7. Film morphology
The surface morphology of the photoactive layers was investigated by using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM images of blend films of copolymers:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) are shown in Fig. 6. It can be clearly observed that P1:PC71BM exhibited a relatively rough morphology with the existence of large aggregates, which can be correlated with the unfavorable miscibility of P1 and PC71BM. The root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of the P1:PC71BM film is 2.8 nm, which is much larger than that of 1.4 nm and 1.2 nm for the copolymer:PC71BM films based on longer side chain copolymers P2 and P3, respectively. We surmise that the rough film morphology of P1:PC71BM is not favorable for charge transportation, thereby leading to a much lower short circuit current than those of P2 and P3.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a series of novel alkyltriazole functionalized benzodithiophene derivatives were developed based on Cu(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition. The developed compounds can be used to as electron-donating moieties to construct a new donor–acceptor type of narrow band-gap conjugated polymers, which exhibited high thermal stability and good solubility in common organic solvents. Despite the fact that all copolymers exhibited quite comparable absorption profiles with nearly identical optical band gaps, copolymers with longer alkyl side groups exhibited a slightly higher absorption coefficient. It was also realized that the alkyl side groups in the triazole unit have trivial effects on the electrochemical properties. The solar cell devices based on the copolymer with the shortest alkyl side chain exhibited the rougher film morphology and lower charge carrier mobility. The bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells by using these polymers as the electron-donating materials and PC71BM as the electron-accepting materials exhibited moderate photovoltaic performances.
