    , Accepted 29th May 2017First published on 5th June 2017AbstractPoly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is a promising p-type polymer to optimize the architecture, charge transfer, and environmental stability in electronic devices. Therefore, it can be a suitable material for a hole transporting layer in lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the mismatch of band alignment with perovskites suppresses efficient charge extraction and transfer. This results in the significant loss of open-circuit voltage (Voc) and resultant device performance deterioration. Therefore, modifying the energy level is essential to improve band alignment with perovskites. Here, a cobalt complex, tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine) cobalt(II) di[bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide] (Co(II)-TFSI) is used as a p-dopant in P3HT. This enhances the conductivity and leads to a downward shift of the energy levels. The efficient charge extraction and transfer from perovskite considerably improves the device performance, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.28% and Voc of 1.061 V. Moreover, a flexible device incorporating Co-P3HT exhibits impressive 11.84% PCE and mechanical stability up to 600 bending cycles. And the flexible Co-P3HT device shows better air stability than the Li-doped P3HT (Li-P3HT) device for 40 days. These results suggest that Co(II)-TFSI is an alternative to Li salts to realize high performance in PSCs incorporating polythiophene derivatives.
Introduction
Lead halide perovskites have attracted great attention due to their excellent charge carrier mobility (66–217 cm2 V−1 s−1 for single crystal and 11.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for polycrystal),1–3 light absorption coefficient (5.7 × 104 cm−1 at 600 nm),4 long electron–hole diffusion length (>175 μm for single crystal and 0.1–1 μm for polycrystal),5–7 and tunable band gaps that can be used for versatile optoelectronic devices including solar cells,8–11 light-emitting diodes,12–15 and photodetectors.16–18 By virtue of the many efforts put into the development of thin films of perovskites via structural variations, compositional engineering, and morphological optimization, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells has been boosted up to 22.1%, which is comparable to that of polycrystalline Si solar cells.19–25 Moreover, flexible devices have been realized by means of low-temperature solution processing of perovskites. The rational design of charge transporting layers in the interface has considerably improved the performance of such devices by up to 17.3%, which suggests the high feasibility of building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems as well as wearable energy supplies.26–34
Hole transporting layers (HTLs) in flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been developed with two classes of materials – metal oxides and organic semiconductors. In case of metal oxides, nickel oxide (NiOx) is often considered a representative of the metal oxide-based HTLs.35–41 Sintering Ni precursors to prepare NiOx thin films or pre-synthesis of NiOx nanoparticles is essential.35–40 In this regard, p-type polymers or small molecules are desirable to achieve both flexible architecture and high device performance. Thus far, PSCs employing 2,2,7,7-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as the hole transporting material have exhibited the best performance.22–24,42 Spiro-OMeTAD has a high conductivity (2 × 10−3 S cm−1) after Li-doping and has a low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level (−5.3 eV) that is suitable for band alignment with the valence band maximum (EVBM) of perovskites.43
Meanwhile, polythiophene derivatives have been thought of as an alternative hole transporting material to spiro-OMeTAD, from the perspectives of the film forming quality. The faster crystallization of small molecules than that of polymers hampers the formation of high-quality thin films since the crystallization rate is inversely proportional to the molecular weight of organic materials.44 Recently, high density of pin holes within a spiro-OMeTAD thin film has been observed during spin coating.45,46 These defects led to the direct contact between perovskite and metal electrodes, thereby the device performance was degraded.45,46 Therefore, pin hole-free polymer thin films would be a suitable HTL to further expand their active area as well as to guarantee the high uniformity of device performance. In this regard, polythiophene derivatives can be a promising candidate as a polymer HTL of PSCs for large-area devices.
Moreover, many reports on the environmental stability of organic HTLs have demonstrated that polythiophene derivatives showed better stability than small molecules due to their oxygen impermeability and robust hydrophobicity.47 Nevertheless, the higher HOMO level (−4.8 to −5.1 eV) of P3HT than that of spiro-OMeTAD results in a significant loss of the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the PSCs. Therefore, the devices using Li-doped P3HT (Li-P3HT) have not been able to achieve a PCE of 16%, this drawback was attributed to the low Voc (0.9–0.95 V). Even though some effort was made to improve PCEs through the modification of P3HT films by doping tetrafluoro-tetracyano-quinodimethane (F4TCNQ) or by mixing carbon nanotubes, the impressive device performance was not shown.48,49 Recently, Grätzel et al. demonstrated that the doping of a cobalt complex, tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine) cobalt(III) tri[bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide] (Co(III)-TFSI) in spiro-OMeTAD significantly improved the Voc of the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) and PSCs.23,50,51 The strong oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD by Co3+ lowered its HOMO level, which facilitated better band alignment of spiro-OMeTAD and perovskites.52 But, an additional dopant, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), was still required to produce high conductivity in spiro-OMeTAD, since the poor miscibility of Co(III)-TFSI in the solution restrained doping at a high concentration. Moreover, the hygroscopic nature of Li-TFSI rapidly corrodes the perovskites and eventually deteriorates the device performance.
In this work, we selected another Co dopant, tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine) cobalt(II) di[bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide] (Co(II)-TFSI), to achieve both high performance and environmental stability in P3HT-based PSCs without additional Li doping. The good miscibility of Co(II)-TFSI with a P3HT solution facilitates p-doping in P3HT with a high molar concentration (1.6 mM). The intercalation of Co2+ between the thiophene backbones effectively oxidizes thiophenes, and the HOMO levels of P3HT drop dramatically from −4.94 eV to −5.23 eV; at the same time, its conductivity increases from 4.37 × 10−5 S cm−1 to 1.53 × 10−3 S cm−1. This significantly improves the photovoltaic parameters of CH3NH3PbI3-based devices, especially the Voc, which increases from 0.868 V to 1.061 V and leads to an impressive PCE of 16.28%. Moreover, highly efficient and flexible devices (active area = 1.4 cm2) are also realized with an average PCE of 11.44%. The Co-doped P3HT (Co-P3HT) devices exhibit better environmental stability than Li-P3HT devices due to the higher redox potential of the Co complex.
Experimental
Materials
P3HT (regioregular, 99%), PCBM (>99%), Li-TFSI (99.95%), poly(ethyleneimine)-ethoxylated (PEIE) (80% ethoxylated solution), anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) (99.8%), anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (99.9%), anhydrous diethyl ether (99.9%), anhydrous m-xylene (>99%), anhydrous chlorobenzene (99.8%), anhydrous acetonitrile (99.8%), anhydrous 2-methoxyethanol (99.8%), 4-tert-butyl pyridine (tBP) (96%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PbI2 (99.9985%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) (99.98%) and Co(II)-TFSI were purchased from Dyesol. The CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution was prepared via the Lewis base adduct method from a previous report; 461 mg of PbI2, 159 mg of MAI, and 78 mg of DMSO were mixed with 600 mg of DMF.53 The Co-P3HT solutions were prepared in two steps; initially, 12 mg of P3HT was dissolved in 1 mL of m-xylene at 60 °C. After 1 h, 18 μL of acetonitrile, 6 μL of tBP, and Co(II)-TFSI of different molar concentrations (α = 0–2.24) were added to the P3HT solution. The solutions were kept at 60 °C. The PEIE solution was prepared by dilution of 2 wt% PEIE in 2-methoxyethanol, and the PCBM solution was prepared by dissolving 2 wt% of PCBM in chlorobenzene. All solutions were filtered by a syringe filter with a 0.45 μm pore size.
Solar cell fabrication
Etched ITO/glasses (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) and ITO/PEN (4 cm × 4 cm) substrates were rinsed with acetone and 2-propanol (1:1 volume ratio) under ultrasonication for 10 min. They were further rinsed with deionized water and dried in a N2 atmosphere. Subsequently, they were treated with UV–ozone for 20 min. The PEIE solution was spin-coated at 6000 rpm for 50 s onto the desired substrate. The substrate was baked at 100 °C for 5 min. A PCBM solution was spin-coated onto the ITO–PEIE coated substrate at 1500 rpm for 30 s. The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated onto the sample at 4000 rpm for 25 s and 0.5 mL of diethyl ether was dripped, for 10 s, on the rotating sample.53 This sample was then heated at 65 °C for 1 min and at 100 °C for 2 min. The Co-P3HT solution was spin-coated onto the perovskite coated sample at 3000 rpm for 30 s. All steps from the deposition of PEIE to that of Co-P3HT were performed at a relative humidity of 25%. Afterwards, the Au electrode was deposited at a constant rate of 0.5 Å using a thermal evaporator. The film thickness of PEIE, PCBM, CH3NH3PbI3, P3HT and Au was 2 nm,54 40 nm, 450 nm, 70 nm and 120 nm, respectively.
Characterization
UV-Vis spectra of Co-P3HT were obtained by using a UV-Vis spectrometer (Scinco S-3100). The P3HT morphologies were investigated using an AFM (Dimension 3100, Digital Instrument Co.). XRD analysis was performed using a X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Ultima IV). UPS measurements were performed on a scanning XPS microprobe (PHI 5000 VersaProbe, Ulvac-PHI) equipped with a HeI monochromator (21.2 eV). Time-resolved PL measurements were performed at the PL maxima of the perovskite (760 nm), using a time-correlated single photon counting module (TCSPC, MPD-PDM Series DET-40 photon counting detector and Pendulum CNT-91 frequency counter); this module was combined with a monochromator and a second-harmonic-generated 400 nm laser, derived from a 800 nm Ti:Sapphire laser (Mai Tai, Spectra-Physics), which served as a detector and an excitation source, respectively. The I–V curves were obtained by using an Agilent E5270A parametric measurement mainframe. The J–V curves were obtained by using a Keithley model 2400 source meter unit. A 180 W xenon lamp in a solar simulator was used as the light source. The light intensity was adjusted to AM 1.5G by using an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with a KG-1 filter. The active areas of 0.12 cm2 and 1.4 cm2 were defined using metal masks. EQE spectra were obtained at wavelengths ranging from 300 nm to 850 nm using IPCE equipment (PV Measurement, Inc.).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1A presents the schematic of Co doping in P3HT. The Co2+ acts as a redox shuttle and a donor of charge carriers in P3HT. The intercalation of Co2+ among the P3HT backbones occurred by electrostatic attraction between the unpaired electrons of a sulfur atom and Co2+, where the cation bridges reduce the distance between the backbones. As a result, the π-conjugation of the backbones becomes stronger. This was reflected in the variation of the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra of the Co-P3HT thin films (Fig. 1B). The increasing molar concentration (α, mM) of Co(II)-TFSI enhanced the intensity of the shoulder peaks at 605 nm and they saturated at α = 0.64. In addition, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis clearly demonstrated the intercalation of Co2+, as shown in Fig. 1C. The filling of Co2+ in the interchain space caused a slight increase in the lattice distance.55 The main peaks of P3HT, (x00) (x = 1, 2, 3…), shifted towards smaller angles. When the (100) peaks shifted from 5.57° to 5.12°, the estimated lattice constant (a) for the a-axis of P3HT increased from 1.61 nm to 1.73 nm. At a certain point (α = 1.6), the shift in the peaks saturated due to the saturation of ions in the P3HT matrix.

The surface morphologies of P3HT also changed as α increased. The surface energy of the polymer chains was inversely proportional to the concentration of the metal salts.56 The electrostatic attraction between the functional group (i.e., ether, pyridine, thiophene) and the metal cation is accompanied by a decrease in the chain mobility, leading to peculiar film morphologies.57–59Fig. 2 illustrates the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of 70 nm thick Co-P3HT thin films. The typical morphology of the pristine P3HT thin film was also observed (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, P3HT nanocrystallites emerged at α = 0.32 and short nanorods (<200 nm) were created by the electrostatic attraction-induced π-conjugation at α = 0.64, these observations corresponded well with the UV-Vis spectra (Fig. 2B and C and ESI Fig. S1†). It should be noted that the additional growth of nanorods to nanofibrils was not observed at α > 0.64, since the suppressed chain mobility favors puddle-like film morphologies rather than the nanofibrillar structure. Fig. 2D–H show the broadening in the puddles with a gradual increase in the average surface roughness (Ra) from 0.58 nm to 2.15 nm. (ESI Fig. S2†). At above α = 1.92, the precipitation of excess Co(II)-TFSI was observed due to the cobalt complex reaching its maximum solubility limit and phase separating from P3HT. Large particles with several tens of micrometers were generated and they would lead to a degradation in the device performance (ESI Fig. S3†).

Effective single-electron oxidation of a thiophene is enabled by Co complexes with deep oxidation potential. Their oxidation potential shows some deviation from the general trend of Co complexes because the spin configuration is strongly affected by the ligands surrounding Co cations.39 The oxidation potential of Co(III)-TFSI is around 0.08 V higher than that of Co(II)-TFSI, that is, more effective oxidation of thiophenes can occur by reaction with Co(III)-TFSI.60 However, Co(III)-TFSI was poorly miscible in a P3HT/m-xylene solution, while Co(II)-TFSI showed good miscibility and stability in the solution even after 24 h. The abrupt drop in the solubility of P3HT by Co(III)-TFSI generated many P3HT particles immediately after the salt was injected, as shown in the ESI Fig. S4.† Therefore, the use of Co(II)-TFSI is more likely to guarantee high-quality Co-P3HT thin films. Fig. 3 describes the spectral responses of Co-P3HT, obtained by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Both the cut-off binding energy (Ecut-off) and Fermi edge (EF,edge) were negatively shifted by the oxidation of thiophenes (Fig. 3A and B). From the analysis of the Fermi levels (EF = Ecut-off − 21.2 eV), the HOMO levels (EHOMO = EF − EF,edge) were found to be −4.94 eV, −5.09 eV, −5.23 eV, and −5.22 eV for α = 0, 0.64, 1.6, and 2.24, respectively. They were saturated at α = 1.6 at which point the p-doping was maximized. Furthermore, the difference in the oxidation potentials of P3HT and Co(II)-TFSI was found to be 0.29 V, which was in excellent agreement with previous reports.60,61

In addition to the downward shift of energy levels, the electrical conductivity of P3HT was improved by Co doping. The donation of charge carriers in Co2+ to the thiophenes led to an increase in the charge carrier density. Fig. 4A exhibits the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of Co-P3HT at different α values. The conductivity (σ) can be estimated by the following equations, (1) (2)where ρ is the resistivity, R is the resistance, A is the cross-sectional area (thickness = 70 nm and width = 1500 μm) of the P3HT films, and L is the distance between the Au electrodes (150 μm) (ESI Fig. S5†). The increase in the conductivity was proportional to α, and was found to be 4.37 × 10−5 S cm−1, 1.76 × 10−4 S cm−1, and 1.53 × 10−3 S cm−1 for α = 0, 0.64, and 1.6, respectively. However, at α > 1.92, large Co(II)-TFSI precipitates acted as severe defects in the films and restricted the electrical connectivity in the films; hence, the conductivity was dramatically reduced from 8.3 × 10−4 S cm−1 to 3.59 × 10−4 S cm−1 when α increased from 1.92 to 2.24. The HOMO levels and the conductivity of Co-P3HT are summarized in Table 1.

Now the optimized HOMO levels and the conductivity of P3HT would promote efficient charge extraction and transfer from perovskites (CH3NH3PbI3). We measured the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decays to investigate the charge extraction and transfer at the interface of the P3HT and the perovskite (Fig. 4B). The inset briefly describes the process of PL measurement of the samples. The incident laser with a 400 nm wavelength excited charge carriers and the PL was detected at 760 nm. The PL decay transients and the corresponding PL lifetimes were fitted with a bi-exponential decay function. The fitted parameters for glass/perovskite/P3HT at different α values are summarized in ESI Table S1.† The fast decay (τ1) suggests the quenching of charge carriers from the perovskite to the P3HT, and the slow decay (τ2) corresponds with the radiative decay within the perovskite film.62 Further, the PL decay and PL lifetimes of the glass/perovskite/P3HT were also considerably affected by α. The average PL lifetimes (τ) were found to be 19.78 ns, 11.17 ns, 3.94 ns, and 8.27 ns for α = 0, 0.64, 1.6, and 2.24, respectively. The PL lifetimes got shorter, accompanied by the increase in the amplitude related to the fast decay suggesting that the charge extraction from the perovskite became dominant. That is, τ1 and τ2 becoming shorter as α increased suggested that the depopulation of photogenerated charge carriers became more dominant through charge collection at perovskite/P3HT, accompanying delayed radiative recombination.63 Therefore, the faster hole transfer from the perovskite to the Co-P3HT suppressed the charge recombination, which led to the higher Jsc.63 And the increase in τ at α = 2.24 was attributed to the Co(II)-TFSI precipitates that suppressed efficient charge transfer.
In order to realize Co-P3HT based PSCs with an n–i–p planar structure, the indium tin oxide (ITO) surface should be modified with PEIE, which increases the work function of the ITO up to −4.0 eV; this increase was attributed to the dipole injection from the imine group of PEIE.64 [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an electron transporting layer (ETL) was spin-coated onto ITO–PEIE. Because the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of PCBM is about −3.9 eV, the increase in the work function of the ITO would reduce the energy loss and facilitate electron transfer from the conduction band minimum (ECBM) of perovskite.30,64Fig. 5A shows the cross-section field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) image of the device architecture. A 450 nm thick perovskite layer was deposited onto a 40 nm thick PCBM by employing the Lewis base adduct method.53 The highly crystalline (grain size = 100–500 nm) and pin hole-free morphology was obtained as shown in ESI Fig. S6.†Fig. 5B illustrates the schematic of an energy diagram of the device accounting for the transfer of charge carriers generated in the perovskite. The Co-P3HT devices showed a noticeable change in the performance in proportion to α. As shown in Fig. 5C, PCEs of 16.28% and 15.87% were obtained at α = 1.6, when subjected to backward and forward sweeps at a scan delay time of 200 ms, respectively. It should be noted that all the photovoltaic parameters were significantly improved. Voc, Jsc, and FF jumped from 0.868 V to 1.061 V, from 15.04 mA cm−2 to 21.83 mA cm−2, and from 0.477 to 0.703 at α = 0 and 1.6, respectively. At α = 2.24, the large precipitates on the Co-P3HT film hindered metal contact and charge transfer, which significantly reduced the device performance (PCE = 7.62%). Therefore, the slight increase in the Ra of the P3HT films after doping did not affect the device performance; on the other hand, the maximum miscibility of P3HT and Co(II) would determine the device performance. Except the device at α = 2.24, all other devices showed hysteresis-less behavior since the capacitive hysteresis was suppressed at the interfacial contact of perovskite and organic semiconductors, as was shown in the inverted planar PSCs.65 Compared to the Li-P3HT device, a low Voc of 0.901 was observed along with a comparable Jsc = 20.71 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.677 in the Co-P3HT device, thus producing the lower PCE of 12.63% (ESI Fig. S7†). The deviation in the Voc of the Co-P3HT and Li-P3HT devices was attributed to the degree of charge recombination and energy loss that is determined by the band alignment between the HOMO level of P3HT and the EVBM of perovskites.66 The Voc can be simply determined by the following equation,66 Voc = Efn − Efp(3)where Efn is the electron quasi-Fermi level and Efp is the hole quasi-Fermi level. A decrease in the hole injection barrier (ϕp) by a downward shift of the HOMO level would lower the Efp, which is accompanied by an increasing Voc, as shown in ESI Fig. S8.† Therefore, Co doping would be more helpful than Li doping in improving the Voc of P3HT-based PSCs.

(C) Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of Co-P3HT devices (at α = 0, 0.64, 1.6, and 2.24) measured with a backward–forward scan for 200 ms of scan-delay time. The measurements were performed under standard AM 1.5G illumination. (D) Steady-state photocurrent density of the devices measured at the corresponding Vmax at α = 0, 0.64, 1.6, and 2.24. (E) EQE spectra of the devices at α = 0, 0.64, 1.6, and 2.24. (F) Histogram of PCEs for 20 devices (α = 1.6). 
As mentioned above, the conductive Co-P3HT provided fast decay of PL lifetimes of the perovskite, which suggested the suppressed charge recombination. This allowed the facilitation of charge transport at perovskite/P3HT, thereby photocurrent would increase. The FF can be determined by interfacial resistance at perovskite/P3HT.30 And the improved conductivity in P3HT after Co doping reduced interfacial resistance, therefore, increasing FF was observed as α increased up to 1.6.

Fig. 5D shows the steady-state photocurrent density of Co-P3HT devices. The saturated Jsc was obtained at the maximum power point (Vmax), this result is consistent with the PCEs obtained from the J–V curves. The better the device performance, the faster was the saturation of photocurrent, since the photoresponse rate was strongly dependent on the rate of the charge transfer.17,67,68 The saturated Jsc was found to be 11.87 mA cm−2 (Vmax = 0.433 V), 15.56 mA cm−2 (Vmax = 0.635 V), 18.68 mA cm−2 (Vmax = 0.82), and 13.81 mA cm−2 (Vmax = 0.475 V) at α = 0, 0.64, 1.6, and 2.24, respectively. Fig. 5E shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices. The spectral peaks appeared around 500 nm, but the EQE of the device for α = 0 started to decrease dramatically at this point, while that of the other devices was retained up to 750 nm since the charge transfer from pristine P3HT to Au was suppressed.68 These observations agree well with the integrated Jsc from the EQE spectra and the Jsc obtained from the J–V curves, which were found to be 13.08 mA cm−2, 17.12 mA cm−2, 20.35 mA cm−2, and 15.98 mA cm−2 for α = 0, 0.64, 1.6, and 2.24, respectively. The histogram demonstrates the high reproducibility with 20 devices (Fig. 5F). The average PCE of the best performing device (α = 1.6) was 15.32%. The photovoltaic parameters determined for these PSCs are summarized in Table 2.

Organic semiconductors are suitable materials for deformable electronic devices due to their excellent mechanical flexibility and the possibility of low-temperature fabrication.69 Therefore, in our device architecture, a plastic substrate such as poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PEN) can be used to fabricate flexible PSCs. Fig. 6A depicts the photograph of an actual flexible device. The inset shows the schematic of a configured flexible device with dimensions of 4 cm × 4 cm. The three-active areas are patterned with a large area of 1.4 cm2 (total area = 4.2 cm2) each, and they exhibited impressive PCEs of 11.53%, 11.84%, and 10.94% for Channel 1, Channel 2, and Channel 3, respectively (Fig. 6B). The photovoltaic parameters of the device are summarized in Table 3. When the active area was small (0.12 cm2), the PCE of the flexible cell was found to be 14.25% (ESI Fig. S9†). The low performance at a large active area was attributed to the increase in the interfacial resistance.34,70 Before bending, the integrated Jsc of Channel 2 from the EQE spectrum was found to be 18.4 mA cm−2, which was consistent with the current density (19.75 mA cm−2 obtained from the J–V curve shown in Fig. 6C). The flexible device demonstrated excellent durability despite bending and even twisting, when it was used to operate a small fan at 1 sun condition as shown in ESI Video S1.† To further elucidate the bending durability, the J–V curves of the Channel 2 were measured after recovery from the given bending radii (r) (Fig. 6D). The PCEs were found to be 11.46%, 11.16%, 9.79%, and 3.89% at r = 15 mm, 10 mm, 7 mm, and 4 mm, respectively. The drop in the PCE at r = 7 mm was attributed to the plastic deformation of the substrate.28 Further bending (r = 4 mm) of the device generated ITO cracks that propagated the mechanical stress to the upper layers so that they were broken, resulting in a significant degradation in the device performance (ESI Fig. S10†). The mechanical stability of two independent devices was demonstrated up to 600 bending cycles at r = 15 mm and 10 mm. After 600 bending cycles, the initial efficiencies of 11.65% and 11.56% were found to be 11.28% and 10.76% at r = 15 mm and 10 mm, respectively (Fig. 6E). The histogram shows the high reproducibility of 20 devices with an average PCE of 10.68% (Fig. 6F). Lastly, we also investigated the environmental stability of the flexible devices. Co(II)-TFSI, which is more air-stable than Li-TFSI, due to the higher redox potential of Co2+ (−0.28 eV) than that of Li+ (−3.04 eV), would suppress the adsorption of water or oxygen molecules and improve the air stability of the devices. The flexible Co-P3HT and Li-P3HT devices with an active area of 0.12 cm2 were kept in a dark box at a relative humidity of 20%. After 40 days, the initial efficiency was reduced to 71.8% and 43.7% of the initial value (PCE = 14.25% and 12.15%) for Co-P3HT and Li-P3HT devices, respectively (ESI Fig. S11†). These results suggest that the robust and efficient Co-P3HT would be a promising HTL in PSCs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed Co-P3HT as an efficient HTL for PSCs. The changes in the morphology and electrical properties of the P3HT thin films were investigated after Co doping. It is suggested that the electrostatic attraction between thiophene and Co2+ reduced the chain mobility, which resulted in the evolution of puddle-like regions on the films. The downward shift of the HOMO levels and the increase in the conductivity of P3HT by Co doping significantly improved the device performance. Especially, Voc was significantly improved up to 1.061 V, owing to the desirable band alignment of P3HT and perovskite reducing the hole injection barrier and facilitating the charge extraction and transfer from the perovskite. The best PCE of 16.28% was obtained for the Co-P3HT device, which was much higher than that of the Li-P3HT device (12.63%). Moreover, a flexible device was also realized by employing PCBM and P3HT as the charge transporting layers. The flexible device exhibited an impressive PCE of 11.84% with a large active area of 1.4 cm2. Mechanical flexibility and durability of the devices were demonstrated up to 600 bending cycles at r = 10 mm, thus proving that the 93.1% of the initial efficiency was retained. Due to the higher redox potential of Co(II)-TFSI as compared to Li-TFSI, better environmental stability was observed. The Co-P3HT and Li-P3HT devices retained 71.8% and 43.7% of their initial efficiencies, respectively. The strategy of Co doping has the potential to become a new protocol that effectively improves the performance of PSCs incorporating polythiophene derivatives as a HTL.
