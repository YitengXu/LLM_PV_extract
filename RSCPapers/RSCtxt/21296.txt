    , Accepted 30th August 2018First published on 30th August 2018AbstractPoly(3,4-thylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate), PEDOT:PSS, is a popular and cost effective conducting polymer for electrodes that can also be used as a hole transport layer (HTL) in optoelectronics. In this article, we investigated the role of ethylene glycole (EG) in the conductivity enhancement of PEDOT:PSS and WOx doped PEDOT:PSS films. Multiple EG solvent treatments increase the conductivity up to 3000 S cm−1 (PEDOT:PSS) and 1980 S cm−1 (PEDOT:PSS:WOx). EG treated PEDOT:PSS:WOx thin films exhibited transmittance as high as 95% in the visible range and sheet resistance as low as 35 Ω sq−1. And, PEDOT:PSS films exhibited sheet resistance of 25 Ω sq−1 at 90% transmittance, which is the lowest value reported to date to the best of our knowledge. Additionally, thin films treated with EG multiple times exhibit improved thermal stability; thin films annealed at 250 °C have shown a remarkable stable conductivity. Furthermore, these layers are investigated as HTLs for high efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Neat PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx, and EG treated PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx integrated in PSCs demonstrated a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.17%, 10.42%, 12.31% and 12.69%, respectively. The improved performance of cells with modified PEDOT:PSS HTLs results in improved current density and fill factor.
Introduction
Due to the fast development of optoelectronics (light emission diodes (LEDs), solar cells, liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and sensors, etc.), there is a huge demand for low-cost and highly transparent electrodes. Indium tin oxide (ITO) is the most commonly used material for transparent electrodes but its extreme brittleness and the global scarcity of indium make it unsuitable for low-cost flexible electronic devices. Additionally, high temperature processing, low transparency in the blue region, and diffusion of indium and oxygen from ITO into organic layers are the main reasons to look for alternatives.1 Consequently, a lot of research studies have focused on developing ITO-free electrodes, and graphene,2 carbon nanotubes,3 metal grids,4 and conducting polymers5,6 have emerged as possible alternatives to ITO.
PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-thylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)) is a well-known conducting polymer. However, an as-prepared PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH1000) thin film from its aqueous solution produces a low conductivity close to 1 S cm−1, which hinders its use as an alternative for a transparent electrode. Numerous studies have been done to improve the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. Zhang et al., in early 2000, first showed that the sheet resistance of pristine PEDOT:PSS (1.5 × 10−5 Ω sq−1) can be reduced by glycerol to 1.3 × 10−3 Ω sq−1, and by sorbitol to 1 × 10−3 Ω sq−1 through solvent mixing.7 Since then, owing to its simplicity, addition of solvents to aqueous PEDOT:PSS has gained huge attention. Numerous solvents, such as organic polar solvents (diethylene glycol (DEG),10,11meso-erythritol,12 ethylene glycol (EG),10,13,14 glycerol,7 sorbitol,7 dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),11,13–15N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF),13,15 butanol,16 and ethanol17), organic salts,18 surfactants,19–22 and ionic liquids23 have been explored. The conductivity of PEDOT:PSS shows two to three orders of improvement up to 1000 S cm−1, and a sheet resistance higher than 100 Ω sq−1. Furthermore, a conductivity higher than 1000 S cm−1 is reported when polar solvents or acid solutions are dropped on hot PEDOT:PSS films followed by rinsing and drying,24–27 or when the PEDOT:PSS films are dipped in polar solvents or acids.28–30 Among them, a strong acid, H2SO4, and a relatively weak acid, H3PO4, produce the highest conductivity which is higher than 3000 S cm−1, and a sheet resistance close to 45 Ω sq−1, and transparency as high as 85% in the visible region, which is comparable to that of ITO.25,31,32 However, acids are corrosive in nature, which could corrode the plastic substrate and can damage the interlayers. Therefore, alternative solvents are needed. The conductivity enhancement of PEDOT:PSS treated thin films with various solvents is summarized in Table S1 (ESI†).
The main mechanism explaining the increase of the conductivity is to increase the phase separation between large domains of conducting PEDOT and insulating PSS, transforming coil formation of the PEDOT:PSS network into a linear chain of PEDOT and PSS.8,9 In addition, solvent treatment washed away part of the PSS, and thus a PEDOT rich surface is formed. PEDOT grains are hydrophobic which causes coating issues for the depositing layer due to its non-wetting surface. For instance, ethanol/H2O treatment increases the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS but when these interlayers were integrated into perovskite solar cells (PSCs) they demonstrated an adverse effect on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of cells compared to neat PEDOT:PSS, used as a hole transporting layer (HTL).17 Such issues could be resolved by increasing wettability by adding hydrophilic content of PSS-Na to PEDOT:PSS, however, this reduces its conductivity.17 Alternatively, it has been shown that the perovskite precursor spin coated on the non-wetting surface decreases surface tension dragging force, which decreases the nucleation site, and thus larger perovskite grains can be formed by increasing grain boundary mobility in the presence of heated substrates and/or solvents during thin film processing.33 This could provide an effective strategy for the non-wetting surface of the hydrophobic PEDOT surface. Furthermore, hygroscopic properties of PEDOT:PSS could significantly be reduced by metal oxide incorporations. Metal oxides acting as a dopant in PEDOT:PSS have shown an increase in the conductivity and greater environmental stability of LEDs and organic photovoltaics (OPVs),34–41i.e., WOx doping in PEDOT:PSS could reduce WOx to lower oxidation states such as WO4−, WO3−, and WO2−, which could act as an anion by replacing PSS from the PEDOT:PSS network.34 Therefore, environmental stability can be improved significantly.
In this article, we studied conductivity enhancement of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx films by treatment with ethylene glycol (EG) for multiple treatments, annealing times, and annealing temperatures. Thin films are characterized via conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Additionally, PSC devices are fabricated to support the argument.
Results and discussion
The chemical structures of PEDOT:PSS and EG are depicted in Fig. 1(a). The EG treatments were carried out with two different methods; process 1 depicts multiple EG treatments on one time coated PEDOT:PSS:WOx thin films and process 2 depicts EG treatments carried out each time on multiple coated PEODT:PSS:WOx thin films. A significant enhancement in the conductivity is observed in process 1 and process 2 of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx (Fig. 1(c)). The optimized thickness and conductivity of neat PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx thin films are 50 and 40 nm, and 1 and 10 S cm−1, respectively. The electrical conductivity of a single PEDOT:PSS (PEDOT:PSS:WOx) layer after one time of EG treatment improves to 1900 S cm−1 (1400 S cm−1). Furthermore, PEDOT:PSS thin films treated 4 times with EG have the highest conductivity up to 2900 S cm−1. WOx doped PEDOT:PSS thin films show less improvement (1980 S cm−1) with multiple (3 times) EG treatments. Further EG treatments reduce the conductivity owing to carrier delocalization and overscreening of the negative charge from PSS by increased EG concentrations.42 We believe that the structural modification of the PEDOT:PSS films upon WOx incorporation restrains further modifications, which is discussed later. The optimized conductivities of EG treated PEDOT:PSS and metal oxide (MO) doped PEDOT:PSS are depicted in Table 1. Among the conductivities obtained from the various PEDOT:PSS:MO mixtures, PEDOT:PSS:WOx shows the highest conductivity.

Conductivity of EG treated PEDOT:PSS (PEDOT:PSS:WOx) increases with annealing temperature up to 180 °C (150 °C) as shown in Fig. S1(a) (ESI†). Further annealing of both the thin films up to 240 °C and annealing time up to 40 (30) min results in stable conductivity values (Fig. S1(a) and (b), ESI†).
Furthermore, the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS:WOx does not vary between 30 min and 1 h, which is a significant improvement due to improved stability of thin films at elevated temperature. This suggests that the multiple EG treated PEDOT:PSS, especially PEDOT:PSS:WOx films, demonstrate a better thermal stability than previously studied single EG treated or EG dipped PEDOT:PSS films.25,31,32 The highest conductivity of 3000 (1980) S cm−1 is obtained on multiple layers of PEDOT:PSS (PEDOT:PSS:WOx) after EG treatment was carried out on each layer, which is close to the conductivity obtained on a single layer after 4 (3) times of EG treatment (Fig. S2(a), ESI†).
The electrical conductivity calculated from the sheet resistance resembles the conductivity calculated by Hall effect measurements as shown in Fig. 2(a). Fig. 2 (a)–(c) and Fig. S2(a)–(c) (ESI†) depict conductivity, carrier concentration and mobility of multiple times of EG treatment on single and multiple layered PEDOT:PSS (PEDOT:PSS:WOx), respectively. The enhanced conductivity of EG-treated thin films is believed to arise from the structural rearrangement from coil formation to elongated grains of PEDOT and phase separated PSS.8,9 Furthermore, satisfactory arguments are made on partial removal of PSS from PEDOT:PSS after solvent treatment which induces structural transformation from the benzoid and quinoid phase of PEDOT:PSS to the mostly quinoid phase.8,9,37 Since conductivity is the by-product of carrier concentration and mobility, with increasing conductivity these values also increase as shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c). The carrier concentrations of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx films increase with increasing EG treatment time and reach 1023 cm−3 (4 times) and 1022 cm−3 (3 times), respectively.

PEDOT:PSS:WOx films exhibited one order lower carrier concentrations than PEDOT:PSS, however, these values are still ten-times and four times higher than those of the pristine PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx films, respectively.
Further EG treatment starts to decrease the carrier concentration. Similar observations are made on multiple EG treatments on multiple coated thin films, despite little variations which might be due to the difference in the film thicknesses as shown in Fig. S2(b) (ESI†). Carrier concentrations reported in this work are more than one order higher than the previously reported values (1019 cm−3 for without-treated PEDOT:PSS, and 1020 for EG and DMSO and 1022 for H2SO4 treated PEDOT:PSS thin films).43,44 On the contrary, the Hall mobility of PEDOT:PSS:WOx is much higher as compared to PEDOT:PSS. The mobility of PEDOT:PSS:WOx films shows a drastic increment from 0.1 to 2.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 whereas the mobility of PEDOT:PSS increases from 0.02 to 0.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with EG treatment. With WOx doping, PEDOT:PSS observed changes in the chemical structure from a mixture of benzoid and quinoid to mostly quinoid.37 Additionally, it is shown that the nanoparticles incorporated in the PEDOT:PSS films result in a weak electron–phonon coupling effect that leads to an increase in mobility.45 Thus, we believe that the increased mobility of WOx nanoparticles is the result of the combined effect of chemical structural modification and weak electron–phonon coupling effect. Table 2 depicts the relationship between thickness and sheet resistance for w/one-time EG treatment on a single layer of (PEDOT:PSS:WOx) and w/o EG treatment. Sheet resistances decrease with decreasing thickness.

Furthermore, we calculated the mean deviation values of the conductivity and sheet resistance of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The sheet resistance after EG treatment (corresponds to highest conductivity) is as low as 25 Ω sq−1 for PEDOT:PSS and 35 Ω sq−1 for PEDOT:PSS:WOx. These are the lowest values reported for the sheet resistance to date to the best of our knowledge.25,31,32 The transparency of the optimized PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx films w.r.t. the highest conductivity values, before and after EG treatment, are shown in Fig. 2(d). A closer inspection reveals that the PEDOT:PSS:WOx films have relatively higher transmittance than PEDOT:PSS films, primarily due to a decease in thickness of the optimized PEDOT:PSS:WOx films of 10 nm. The transmittance plots of multi-layered PEDOT:PSS:WOx with EG treatment on each layer and a single layer of PEDOT:PSS:WOx treated multiple times with EG are shown in Fig. 2(e) and (f), respectively. The transmittance is over 90% (visible range) and increases more than 10% compared to PEDOT:PSS:WOx films without EG treatment. However, as the thickness increases with the number of layers of PEDOT:PSS:WOx transmittance decreases. An interesting observation is made when neat WOx films, prepared by the sol–gel process, are treated with EG (Fig. S3, ESI†) and compared with before and after EG treated PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx films. Transmittance of neat WOx films increases with EG treatment, indicating the partial removal of WOx nanoparticles. Furthermore, PEDOT:PSS:WOx films show a higher transmittance in the green and red emission region (530–800 nm) as compared to PEDOT:PSS, implying that WOx nanoparticles not only modify the structural properties of PEDOT:PSS but also prove to be an important factor for higher transmittance. For applications in optoelectronics, highly transparent electrodes are required, which is better performed by PEDOT:PSS:WOx.

Fig. 3 shows the topography (a) and conducting (b) AFM images, while Table 3 gives the values of the surface root mean square (rms) roughness and the average current for PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx by increasing EG treatment time. The bright and dark regions on topographical images can be assigned to PEDOT and PSS phases, respectively.24–26 The surface roughness and surface current of PEDOT:PSS films increase with increasing EG treatment from 1.50 nm and 13.05 pA (neat) to 3.17 nm and 13.42 pA (1 time EG treatment) and 4.90 nm and 13.84 pA (3 times EG treatment). Increase of the surface current and roughness indicates increased crystallinity by increasing density of conductive PEDOT grains on the surface.11,45 Similar conclusions are made in previous studies.11 Moreover, migration of solvent components and clustering of PEDOT grains on the surface of the films increase surface roughness (Fig. 3(a), 3 times of EG treatment).11 With WOx doping, the PEDOT:PSS:WOx film depicts surface roughness of 1.57 nm which is similar to that of neat PEDOT:PSS. On the contrary, with increasing EG treatment times the surface roughness reduces but the surface current increases to 0.97 nm and 13.55 pA (1 times) and 1.15 nm and 14.53 pA (3 times). Increasing surface current indicates an increase in the conductivity, however, lower surface roughness implies a difference in the mechanism for conductive enhancement (high carrier density in PEDOT:PSS films and higher mobility in PEDOT:PSS:WOx films) in the presence of WOx as illustrated in the schematic in Fig. 3(c). A recent study on CuBr2 doped PEDOT:PSS depicts lower surface roughness and improved conductivity as compared to PEDOT:PSS films dipped in CuBr2 containing solvent, suggesting that the charge screen effect in PEDOT:PSS films varies with the process involved.46 To investigate charge screening or PSS removal by the presence of chemical bonding states via X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS), which might explain the origin of the difference in the morphology in the presence of WOx doped PEDOT:PSS films, we looked into the possible interactions that might take place in PEDOT:PSS:WOx films with EG treatment. We learnt from the transmittance plots that EG treatment(s) partially remove WOx nanoparticles. EG (HO–CH2–CH2–OH) can be dissociated into HO–CH2–CH2–O− and H+, where H+ ions can react with PSS−, resulting in a PSSH neutral phase that does not contribute to the Columbic attraction. PSSH formation would lead to conformational change in PEDOT:PSS, while in WOx doped PEDOT:PSS thin films, WOx is present in its anionic state.34 Therefore, WOx can react with PEDOT+, resulting in a PEDOT+:WOx− mixture which (a) reduces clustering of PEDOT grains and results in elongated PEDOT grains (smooth morphology) and (b) affects the charge screen process in PEDOT:PSS.

Initially, WOx seems to interact with PEDOT chain, however it washes away with EG treatment but could be found on the bottom of the thin films.

XPS spectra of pristine PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx thin films before and after EG treatment are shown in Fig. 5. To gain more insight in the bulk of neat PEDOT:PSS and after EG treatment films, XPS depth profiles are examined. Similar to our previous assumptions, in PEDOT:PSS:WOx films, the W4f peak disappears after EG treatment. Consequently, WOx is on the surface of untreated PEDOT:PSS:WOx. Furthermore, PSS which can be dissociated into PSS-H and PSS-Na, a higher binding energy component can be identified with the S(2p3/2) peak between 170 ± 0.2 and 166 ± 0.2 eV, respectively.46–48 Additionally, the lower binding energy S2p peak between 166 ± 0.2 eV and 162 ± 0.2 eV indicates the presence of PEDOT.46–48 Deconvolution of S2p (PSS and PEDOT) spectra of pristine PEDOT:PSS and after EG treatment on the surface of the thin films is shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), indicating reduction of PSS-H and a slight increase of the PSS-Na intensity. S2p spectra of pristine PEDOT:PSS and after EG treatment in the bulk of the films show significantly higher PEDOT than the surface (w and w/o EG treated films) and complete disappearance of PSS-Na as shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). This resembles our assumptions that the presence of EG leads to the formation of neutral PSS-H which slightly washes away with EG treatment. Furthermore, deconvolution of S2p (PSS and PEDOT) spectra of PEDOT:PSS:WOx films is shown in Fig. 4(e)–(h). On the contrary, the PSS-H peak intensity remains the same and PSS-Na peak intensity is reduced significantly in comparison with neat PEDOT:PSS, indicating that charge screening processes are different in the presence of WOx. The S2p peak of PEDOT broadens and an additional peak arises after WOx incorporation, implying that WOx interacts with PEDOT. Additionally, WOx lying on the surface is more likely to wash away (disappearance of an additional peak) by EG treatment, resulting in lower surface roughness (Fig. 3(a)). Since we suspect that PSS is partially washed away by EG treatment, further analysis is made on the PSS to PEDOT ratio.
 Fig. 4  Deconvolution of S2p spectra of neat PEDOT:PSS (PP) and EG treated PEDOT:PSS (a and b) on the surface and (c and d) bulk (5 nm of sputtering), respectively. Similarly, (e and f) S2p spectra of WOx doped PEDOT:PSS (PP:WOx) and EG treated PEDOT:PSS:WOx thin films (e and f) on the surface and (g and h) the bulk (5 nm of sputtering), respectively. (i) PSS thickness, (j) O1s/S2p ratio, and (k) C1s/S2p ratio on the surface and after a 5 nm etch of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx thin films before and after EG treatment. 
PSS dominates on the surface of the thin films, but the PSS to PEDOT ratio reduces significantly after a 5 nm etch, which shows the phase separation of PSS from PEDOT. The PSS to PEDOT ratio is determined by quantitative analysis of the S(2p) core-level spectra from Fig. 4(a)–(h) and depicted in Fig. 4(i). The PSS to PEDOT ratios (derived from S2p area integral) on the surface of pristine PEDOT:PSS films and after EG treatment are 2.06 and 1.89, respectively. In neat PEDOT:PSS:WOx films, the PSS to PEDOT ratio increases to 2.15, while after EG treatment of the PEDOT:PSS:WOx films, it reduces to 1.69. From the vendor's perspective, the PSS-to-PEDOT molar ratio is 1.2, which is significantly lower than the ratios measured on the surface via XPS.49 Therefore, phase segregation takes place, with an excess of PSS (both on the PSS–PEDOT and the PSS-Na components) on the surface region. In order to obtain a rough estimation about the length scales involved, a simple model of two ideally separated polymers, PSS and PEDOT, in the form of a ‘layer over layer’ structure may be employed. This model is useful to obtain an estimate for the thickness of the outermost PSS-rich layer. Since we are comparing internally, sites from core levels of exactly the same type, S(2p), the relevant expression becomes particularly simple, and has the form:50 d = λln[{(IPSS/I0,PSS)/(IPEDOT/I0,PEDOT)} + 1],(1)where d is the thickness of the outermost layer, λ denotes the electron inelastic mean free path, and I and I0 account for the measured and expected signal intensities from PSS and PEDOT respectively. The effects of the dependence of the electron inelastic mean free path on kinetic energy, photoionization cross-sections, and the transmission function of the spectrometer, etc., cancel each other for the same type of core levels. The thicknesses of the outermost segregated layer of PSS estimated from the equation (eqn (1)) utilizing S2p core spectra (Fig. 4(a)–(h)) and depicted in Fig. 4(i) are 1.66, 1.07, 1.04, and 0.99λ, using the inelastic mean free path data of Clark et al., which gives 31.4, 29.0, 28.3, and 26.7 Å for PEDOT:PSS (PP), PP:EG, PP:WOx and PP:WOx:EG, respectively.51 This number should be treated as a rough estimate for the length scale on which the phase segregation occurs. However, after 5 nm of sputtering, the PSS–PEDOT ratio and PSS thickness reduces to 4.9, 4.8, 5.8, and 5.6 Å, respectively. Furthermore, the presence of O1s and C1s is evaluated w.r.t. S2p as shown in Fig. 4(j) and (k), respectively. Higher O1s is observed on the surface, indicating contamination of the films upon exposure to air. However, except EG treated PEDOT:PSS films all other films depict lower C1s concentrations on the surface, which reveals high PEDOT concentrations on the surface of thin films.
Finally, perovskite solar cells utilizing CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x as a mixed halide semiconductor are fabricated by using modified PEDOT:PSS as HTL (Table 4). A 40 wt% CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x precursor is obtained by mixing methylammonium iodide (MAI) and lead halide (PbCl2, PbI2) in a 1:1 molar ratio in DMF solvent.52 Inorganic lead halide precursors, PbI2 and PbCl2, in CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x are mixed in a 3:1 molar ratio. Fig. 1(a) and (b) depict the device structure and energy band alignment of perovskite (CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x) solar cells with metal oxide doped PEDOT:PSS as HTLs. The work function of PEDOT:PSS (4.84 eV) increases to 4.96 and 5.15 eV by NiOx and WOx doping, respectively. The work functions of ITO and metal oxide doped PEDOT:PSS are used from our previous report and the work functions of perovskite thin films are taken from the literature.35,37,52 The hole transport properties of the modified PEDOT:PSS are calculated using the following geometry (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Al) as shown in Fig. 1(c). The current density of PEDOT:PSS increases upon metal oxide doping due to increased conductivity. Further enhancement of current density resembles the improved conductivity after EG treatment. These highly conductive interlayers are integrated into PSCs to observe the performance of the cells (Fig. 5(d) and (e)). A decent PCE of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x absorber of 9.17% is obtained which is close to the previously reported performance utilizing pristine PEDOT:PSS as HTL.13,17 The PCE with MO doping increases to 9.34% (PEDOT:PSS:NiOx) and 10.42% (PEDOT:PSS:WOx). A 14% enhancement of the PCE mainly contributed to improved current density and fill factor with WOx doping. The PCE of cells integrating EG treated PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx interlayers can further be increased, owing to increased conductivity. EG treated PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx demonstrated 34% (12.31%) and 36% (12.69%) enhancement of the PCE. The current density and fill factor of pristine PEDOT:PSS after EG treatment increase from 16.26 mA cm−2 and 61.25% to 18.31 mA cm−2 and 71.25%, respectively. And, EG treated PEDOT:PSS:WOx produces a high current density and fill factor of 18.69 mA cm−2 and 75.36%, respectively. Despite the higher conductivity of the EG treated PEDOT:PSS as compared to PEDOT:PSS:WOx, PSCs with PEDOT:PSS:WOx have higher PCE than those with PEDOT:PSS due to low leakage current (Fig. 5(e)) and surface roughness (Fig. 3(a)). High fill factors with increasing conductivity of the films are probably due to increased crystallinity of perovskite on a non-wetting surface as suggested by Huang et al.33 Moreover, higher mobility of PEDOT:PSS:WOx increases the charge carrier collection efficiency of photoexcited carriers.

Experimental section
Preparation of PEDOT:PSS thin films
PEDOT:PSS solution Clevios™ PH 1000 was purchased from Hereaus. Ammonium metatungstate (66.5% W) and ethylene glycol were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 1 mmol solution of tungsten oxide was prepared in DI water. Prior to spin coating, glass slides were sonicated in acetone, methanol, IPA and DI water for 15 min each and exposed to UV ozone for 15 min. PEDOT:PSS was spin coated at 4000 rpm for 25 s and baked for 20 min at 120 °C, resulting in a 50 nm thin film (the operation was repeated n times to obtain n layered films). PEDOT:PSS:WOx was obtained by mixing 1 mmol WOx with PEDOT PSS (1:1 v/v ratio) and stirred for 6 h and spin coated under the same conditions as above, resulting in a 40 nm thick thin film.
Fabrication of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x perovskite solar cell devices
The ITO substrates were cleaned with methanol and IPA for 15 min each, followed by UV-Ozone treatment for 15 min. 40 and 30 nm thick PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:metal oxide were spin-coated on ITO and annealed at 150 °C for 15 min, respectively. 300 nm thick CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x thin films were obtained by spin coating on PEDOT:PSS:MO. Thin films were annealed at 100 °C for 20 min in air. To remove the good solvent (DMF) by the bad solvent (CB) for fast recrystallization, 0.5 ml of CB was dropped at the 30th s during spin coating. Finally, top electrodes Liq (1.0 nm) and Al (100 nm) were thermally deposited (1.0 × 10−7) using a shadow mask.
Conclusion
In this study we demonstrated that the conductivity, thermal stability, carrier concentrations and Hall effect mobility of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx can be enhanced significantly by EG solvent treatment. These improvements depend on optimized multiple EG treatments on single layer or multiple layer coated PEDOT:PSS (PEDOT:PSS:WOx) films. The maximum conductivity of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx films with multiple EG treatments on a single layer is about 3000 S cm−1 and 2000 S cm−1, respectively. PEDOT:PSS films observed one order higher charge carrier density than PEDOT:PSS:WOx films; on the contrary, PEDOT:PSS:WOx observed one order higher Hall mobility than PEDOT:PSS films. The sheet resistance and transmittance of EG treated PEDOT:PSS:WOx films are as low as 35 Ω sq−1 and as high as 95%. When these thin films are integrated into perovskite solar cells as HTLs, the PCE of the PSCs improves by 36% (EG treated PEDOT:PSS:WOx).
