    , Accepted 23rd February 2021First published on 24th February 2021AbstractHerein, we disclose the synthesis of new D–π–A push–pull chromophores (10 examples; 2a–2j) by tethering tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) as an auxiliary group instead of previously reported tetracyanoethylene (TCNE). This molecular engineering strategy of incorporating TCNQ on the D–π–A backbone permits a much-extended optical absorption in the near-infra red region compared to TCNE derived analogues. The impact of a dicyanoquinodimethane (DCNQ) moiety on the optoelectronic and electrochemical properties was calculated and correlated with density functional theory/time-dependent density functional theory (DFT/TD-DFT) calculations. The computations revealed an appropriate optical band gap as well as energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) matching the requirement of donor materials for organic solar cells (OSC). Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells by exploring the synthesized chromophores as donor components along with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the acceptor showed power conversion efficiencies ranging between 5.22 and 7.09%. This boosted device efficiency based on TCNQ chromophores compared to TCNE counterparts (1.95 to 3.33%) is ascribed to the favourable molecular structure of the former to contribute for extended light absorption, elevated HOMO energies and better molecular parameters. With respect to cell fabrication, the best performed donor 2j in a 1:1 blend ratio with PCBM seems to be optimal as it exhibits good interdigitated nanostructures and film quality. Processing the best blend (2j:PCBM-1:1 wt/wt) by solvent vapour annealing (SVA) results in better surface morphology, self-ordered structure and charge transport properties to enhance the efficiency up to 7.79%. Overall, this paper validates the influence of the TCNQ acceptor in controlling the physical properties of D–π–A dipolar chromophores for enhanced OSC performance and could inspire the logical selection of this acceptor as an approach to boost the photovoltaic efficiency.
Introduction
Push–pull chromophores are a special class of organic π-semiconductors that have drawn considerable interest in recent times for various optoelectronic applications.1 The efficacy of these chromophores (otherwise molecular semiconductors) was showcased in applications such as dye-sensitized solar cells,2 optical chemosensors,3 organic light emitting diodes,4 organic field effect transistors,5 organic photovoltaics,6 nano-dielectrics,7 non-linear optics,8 bio-imaging,9 and piezochromic10 and electrochromic switches.11 In particular, dipolar chromophores possessing a donor–acceptor (D–A) arrangement have received special attention as π-semiconducting materials appropriate for small molecule organic solar cells (SMOSC). Because of their unsymmetrical electronic arrangement, excited electronic states of low-lying D+A− feature appear as a consequence of enabled D → A intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).12 This scenario leads to an improved excitation charge transfer, thereby narrowing the band gap for better light harvesting propensity.13 In this context, rational synthesis of new push–pull chromophores fulfilling the requisite structural and molecular criteria for SMOSC applications has gained paramount importance. The common strategy from a chemist's perspective to enhance the device performance of a π-semiconductor relies on fine-tuning the physico-chemical properties through structural modification. By far, the focus of such approaches is to modulate molecular properties like the optical band gap, molar absorptivity, HOMO–LUMO energy levels, molecular packing, crystallinity, solubility and charge-carrier mobility.14 Of late, one such strategy relied on integrating a strong electron accepting unit like tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD) within the push–pull system to impart high electron affinity with extended light absorption.15 In general, these molecular scaffolds can be synthesized from alkyne and tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) through [2+2]-cycloaddition/retrocyclization chemistry. Despite the fact that TCBD moieties inherently possess a distorted geometry which may lead to the breaking of D–A π-conjugation paths,16 they have been continuously attempted as active layer materials in SMOSC fabrication.17 Perhaps their strong ICT characteristics which extend the light absorption to the near infrared (NIR) region of the photon flux spectrum override their geometrical restraint. Another advantageous feature of the twisted arrangement is the tendency to form amorphous films of good optical quality by vapour phase deposition techniques rather than crystalline films.18 To name a few relevant works on the application of twisted chromophores in SMOSC, Blanchard et al. were the first to construct planar heterojunction solar cells based on symmetrical and unsymmetrical D–π–A–π–D chromophores to realize an efficiency (η) of up to 1.08%.17a The team of Misra and Sharma explored various unsymmetrical D–A–A–π–D chromophores constructed around a benzothiadiazole skeleton as suitable active layer material for solution processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells to achieve a maximum η of 6.22%.17d In a further endeavour, the same team showed D–A–A type chromophores possessing a naphthalimide tether as a non-fullerene acceptor for BHJ solar cells with η reaching up to 6.11%.17e Likewise, the D–A–A architecture possessing a terminal chromene functionality resulted in an η of 4.21% in a solution processed photovoltaic cell.17f D–A–π–A chromophores possessing a benzothiazole end group were reported to display an η of around 5.27%.17g Diketopyrrole positioned in different D–A arrangements were found to demonstrate an efficiency ranging between 3.90 and 7.19% in BHJ cells.17j Phenothiazine donors flanked in a D–A–D–π–D configuration exhibited an η of 7.35% with an open-circuit voltage >1.0 V in a BHJ device.17k Unsymmetrical D–A–D–π–D chromophores adjoined with ferrocene as lateral groups were reported to show a cell performance of 4.27%.17l In a similar vein, our group has also established a series of D–π–A type thienyl chromophores flanked by TCBD and triphenylamine (TPA) groups as the acceptor and donor respectively. These chromophores produced an encouraging power conversion efficiency ranging from 1.95 to 3.33% in solution processed BHJ solar cells.19a As a logical extension of this work coupled with our research endeavour on π-conjugated semiconductors,19 we envisaged to replace TCNE with tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) to realise much improved molecular properties which in turn is expected to influence the device performance (Fig. 1). The structural variance by incorporating TCNQ brings an additional π-conjugation effect to the molecular backbone and could be pivotal in improvising the physical properties. Moreover, substitution of TCNE by highly electron affinitive TCNQ can promote the crystallite formation via local dipole alignments and/or secondary molecular interactions.20 This scenario could in turn favour effective charge carrier properties and widen the optical transition towards longer wavelength, thereby increasing the power density of the solar spectrum.21 Therefore, understanding the correlation between the structure and properties of TCNQ derived chromophores to their SMOSC performance is the particular emphasis of our study.

In the aforementioned context, we herein disclose the multi-step synthesis of a new series of TCNQ based distorted π-conjugated chromophores. These chromophores were built on a dipolar D–π–A framework by utilizing tri-substituted amine as electron donors (D), thienyl as central electron spacers (π) and TCNQ as the electron acceptor. The aptly positioned TCNQ as the terminal π-accepting group allowed significant variation in the optical and electrochemical properties, attributed to the powerful electron withdrawing property of TCNQ. Computational calculations of the HOMO–LUMO levels correlated well with the experimental photophysical and electrochemical data. BHJ solar cells fabricated using these chromophores as donor materials against PCBM as the acceptor in a 1:1 ratio resulted in an encouraging power conversion efficiency ranging from 5.22 to 7.09%. In fact, the recorded photovoltaic efficiency is on par with the efficiency of most of the twisted molecular semiconductors reported in recent times.17 This is because of the extended absorption edge of our chromophores, which contributes to the much improved short circuit current density (JSC = 11.3 to 17.07 mA cm−2), the highest among TCBD/DCNQ-built small molecular chromophores.17 Among the range of TCBD and DCNQ incorporated semiconductors, the highest efficiency of >7% was reported only in two findings so far.17h,17k More precisely, active layers made of diketopyrrole17h and phenothiazine17k molecules displayed 7.19% and 7.35% efficiencies respectively. However, the best candidate 2j that emerged from our investigation exhibited a better efficiency of 7.79%, the maximum among this class of twisted molecules. In particular, the reported JSC of 17.07 mA cm−2 is the highest for a TCBD/DCNQ based solar cell. It was found that, through SVA treatment of the active layer, the efficiency improved up to 7.79% for the best chromophore 2j. Apparently, the blend ratio and SVA processing are also found to play a crucial role for efficiency enhancement. Our overall results included in this paper unravel the promotional effect of TCNQ in balancing the property requirements of D–π–A based donors and their potentiality in furthering the efficiency of SMOSCs.
Results and discussion
Chemical synthesis
It is pertinent to mention that the synthesis of requisite enyne precursors 1a–1h has already been established through our previous work.19a Thus, we subjected these intermediates to a [2+2]-cycloaddition/retrocyclization chemistry with TCNQ. The resulting non-alkylated chromophores 2a–2h, as shown in Scheme 1, were obtained in yields ranging from 71 to 92%. In spite of their fair solubility in common organic solvents to accomplish solution-processed cell fabrication, we also wanted to explore alkyl chain incorporated chromophores such as 2i and 2j (Scheme 2). This sort of alkyl group engineering could be beneficial in morphological control of the BHJ composite.22 In particular, terthiophene spacers possessing an alkyl substituent at the 3rd or 4th positions has been proven to form an effective D–A structure with strong ICT and broad absorption in OPVs.23 To this end, we speculated 2i by incorporating a 3-alkyl side chain which not only enables solubilization but also holds the 3rd thienyl ring in planarity by avoiding steric interactions with the DCNQ unit and also influences the electron affinity.24 As donors with an –NBu2 group were also explored in BHJ solar cells,25 we also looked into the possibility of replacing –NPh2 by a –NBu2 group in the donor portion in view of comparing the photovoltaic properties of 2j with –NPh2 containing chromophores. From the aforementioned considerations, the synthesis commenced from the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction between commercially available 5′-iodo-2,2′-bithiophene-5-carboxaldehyde I and 3-hexylthiophene-2-boronic acid pinacol ester II to form terthienyl intermediate III. The later upon electrophilic iodination with N-iodosuccinimide followed by Sonogashira coupling with 3-ethynylthiophene V results in the cross-coupled intermediate VI. A Wittig olefination of VI with phosphonium ylide VII26 affords the penultimate enyne intermediate 1i. The last stage of synthesis involves a [2+2]-cycloaddition/retrocyclization step between (1i) and TCNQ to afford the product 2i. Likewise, in an endeavour towards the synthesis of 2j, we initiated a Sonogashira coupling between iodo-precursor I and 1-butyl-4-ethynylbenzene VIII to prepare alkynylated intermediate VIII. The later upon subjecting to a Wittig olefination with ylide X27 lends the enyne intermediate 1j. As a final step, TCNQ were allowed to react with 1j in a typical [2+2]-cycloaddition/retrocyclization manner to generate the desired chromophore 2j. As per our expectation, alkyl group substitution in 2i and 2j enhanced the solubility in solvents like acetone and chloroform compared to the non-alkylated variants 2a–2h (Table S1, ESI†). Structural characterization of all products and intermediates were confirmed by FT-IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS techniques. As a descriptive example, the FT-IR of 2a showed a characteristic nitrile absorbance at 2210 cm−1 and a conjugated CC stretching vibration at 1587 cm−1 respectively. In the 13C NMR spectrum recorded in acetone-d6 solution, two peaks at δ 73.4 and 88.7 ppm agree with the two carbon atoms linked to the (CN)2 group. The four peaks resonated at δ 112.5, 114.1, 118.6, and 121.8 ppm correspond to the four nitrile carbon atoms. HRMS displayed a molecular ion peak at m/z(obs.) = 657.1986 which is in good agreement with the expected value of m/z(expd.) = 657.1987 [M]+.

Optical spectroscopy
To glean information regarding optical band gap (Eoptg), molar absorptivity (ε) and aggregation behaviour, UV-visible electronic spectra of all chromophores in solution (Fig. 2a and Fig. S1, ESI†) as well as in the solid state (Fig. 2b and Fig. S2, ESI†) were recorded (Table 1, left panel). As chloroform solution (C = 4.0 × 10−5 M), chromophores 2a–2i displayed almost similar absorption peaks with λmax located between 712 and 735 nm. Compared to chromophores 2a–2i possessing –NPh2 groups, 2j with a –NBu2 group significantly shifts the λmax to 806 nm. This red shift can be attributed to the electronic differences between –NBu2 and –NPh2 groups in the donor moiety. While the presence of –NPh2 in 2a–j permits an additional conjugative effect with the phenyl rings, it could limit the molecular polarizability and contribute less to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). As 2j possesses only two butyl chains, any additional conjugating effect is not possible, which thereby leads to increased molecular polarizability contributing to a strong ICT and significant component of n–π* transition.28 The spectral transition of all chromophores is consistent with the ICT arising from the HOMO of the donor to the LUMO of the acceptor. In view of molar absorptivity, 2c and 2h emerged as the highest with ε = 38400 and 38750 M−1 cm−1 respectively, which is indicative of the better planarity of their π-conjugated backbone.29 The optical band gap (Eoptg) of all chromophores calculated by the factor, Eoptg (eV) = 1240/λonset was found to be between 1.16 and 1.37 eV. Because of their reduced band gap, these chromophores are expected to harvest low energy photons from the NIR region and thus could influence an efficient photocurrent generation.30 The large ICT magnitude could be attributed to the combination of strong π-accepting DCNQ moiety alongside thiophene π-linkers in influencing the photoexcited properties of the dipolar push–pull system.31 Furthermore, the solid-state spectra of all chromophores displayed red-shifted absorption edges with λonset ranges between 1027 and 1225 nm (1.01 and 1.20 eV). The lowering of band gap moving from solution to solid state suggests the likelihood of J-aggregation.32 Gratifyingly, this extended absorption could favour the enhancement of short circuit current (Jsc) through enlarged spectral overlap with the photon flux spectrum.33 Indeed, this extended absorption is much greater than a standard donor like P3HT and could therefore be beneficial for higher light harvesting efficiency.34 At this point of our investigation on the optical properties of products 2a–2i, we were also curious to recognise the same for the newly synthesized precursors 1i and 1j (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†). To this end, we inspected the UV-vis and photoluminescence of 1i and 1j in chloroform (C = 4.0 × 10−5 M). As depicted in Table S2 (ESI†), the maximum absorption (λmax) for these chromophores corresponding to π–π* transition was found to be 436 and 390 nm for 1i and 1j respectively. Likewise, Eoptg (1i = 2.44 eV; 1j = 2.66 eV) and ε (1i = 47250 M−1 cm−1; 1j = 27950 M−1 cm−1) values were also found to be in good agreement with previously synthesized alkynyl analogues.17a Understandably, the reduced Eoptg and higher ε in 1i compared to 1j can be ascribed to the combination of extended π-conjugation in the spacer as well as donor. This is also the case in their photoluminescence spectra, wherein 1i and 1j displayed green (λem = 525 nm) and blue (λem = 473 nm) emissions respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†). The low energy emission of 1i might be reasoned to its better π–π interaction than 1j, thereby enabling facile formation of an excited species.

Electrochemical properties
The redox properties and HOMO–LUMO energy levels of all chromophores (2a–2j) were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Both these electrochemical experiments were performed in dry chloroform (C = 2.0 × 10−3 M) using nBu4PF6 (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte. A three-electrode set-up comprising of glassy carbon, platinum foil and silver wire were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes respectively. A standard ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) redox couple showing a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.48 V was employed for calibration. The electrochemical data of the chromophores are listed in Table 1 (right panel) and the corresponding cyclic voltammogram and differential pulse voltammogram are shown in Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†) respectively. At the outset, all compounds displayed no oxidation potential in the forward cycle, even when the potential window was set between 0 and 1.5 V. This denotes that the analytes are electrochemically inactive in the defined potential window leading to insignificant current response.35 However, the compounds displayed reversible and quasi-reversible reduction CV peaks in the reverse cycle. This two-step cathodic wave corresponding to the in situ formation of radical-anionic species could be attributed to the sequential one-electron transfer in each-step.36 All compounds exhibited the first reduction potential (ECVred1) between −0.10 and −0.39 V, which is indicative of their strong electron-accepting nature. The LUMO energy (ECVLUMO) of the chromophores was calculated from the respective ECVred1 values using Pommerehne empirical relation, ECVLUMO = –[(ECVred1 − E1/2(ferrocene)) + 4.71] eV.37,38 To this end, the ECVLUMO of all chromophores was estimated to be between −3.84 and −4.13 eV, which is slightly higher than the ELUMO of PCBM, a standard n-type acceptor (−4.3 eV).39 This minimum offset of ∼0.3 to 0.4 eV between the LUMO of chromophores and that of PCBM is a necessary criterion for efficient exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interface,40 thereby ensuring an enhanced short-circuit current density (JSC) in BHJ solar cells. Because of the non-oxidative nature of the chromophores, the HOMO energies were calculated using the factor ECVHOMO = ECVLUMO − Eopt(soln)g. Accordingly, the ECVHOMO was found to be in the range of −5.38 to −5.15 eV, which is rather close to the values of frequently encountered hole-transporting (donor) materials in BHJ solar cells.39,41 The electrochemical properties explored by CV were also validated by DPV, which revealed a similar reduction behavior (Fig. S6, ESI†). Much like CV, most of the compounds exhibited a double reduction wave consistent with the electrochemical reduction of the DCNQ moiety.42 As an exception, compounds 2d, 2f and 2h demonstrated only one reduction wave and could be ascribed to the successive complex reactions triggered by electron transfer of the initially formed radical-anionic species. Nevertheless, the onset of the first cathodic potential (EDPVred1) required to derive the LUMO energy (−3.87 to −4.11 eV) was found to be in good correlation with the ECVred1 values in the same trend (−3.84 to −4.13 eV).
Theoretical calculations
To gain insight into the molecular structure of 2a–2j, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out at the B3LYP/6-31G** level.43 The ground state energy optimized structures of all chromophores in the gas phase are shown in Table S3 (ESI†). The bond length between specific groups in a D–A arrangement is one of the crucial geometrical parameters for controlling the band gap.44 In an effective π-delocalization, the C–C and CC bond length respectively increases and decreases. Therefore, we calculated the carbon–carbon (C–C) single bond length connecting the donor and spacer (BLSD) as well as that of the spacer and acceptor (BLSA). The BLSD and BLSA for all molecules were found to be around 1.43 Å, which is probable for C–C possessing a partial double bond character. This bond length alteration towards the shorter side is an indication of increased electronic communication, a characteristic of dipolar chromophores by virtue of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).45 To glean information on co-planarity, the torsional potential (θ) between C(CN)2 and dicyanoquinone of the accepting unit were examined. The θ value of the gas phase structures was found to be between 67.2° and 81.0°, revealing an orthogonal conformation (+syn-clinial). Though this non-planarity of the acceptor unit could be detrimental for π-electron delocalization, the advantageous factor is the significant reduction of LUMO position to result in a bathochromic shift and a strong electronic communication through the π-spacer.46 These combined molecular features will be in turn beneficial to harvest low energy photons for SMOSCs despite their non-planar accepting unit.17 Apparently, the dicyanoquinone moiety attained co-planarity with a thiophene π-spacer, which could be an added advantage for extended absorption to realize better spectral overlap with the solar photon flux spectrum. At this point of our study, we also performed DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level on chloroform to corroborate the experimental optoelectronic and electrochemical results obtained in chloroform. The electronic structure of frontier molecular orbitals obtained from this calculation is depicted in Table 2. For all compounds, the HOMO contour is found to align throughout the aromatic portions of the π-conjugated backbone and the LUMO is majorly concentrated on the acceptor fragment. This is typical of a dipolar molecule, due to which they tend to exhibit an unsymmetrical push–pull transition leading to a facile and strong ICT from the HOMO of the donor to the LUMO of the acceptor.47 The simulated HOMO–LUMO energies and energy gap of all compounds were found to be in good agreement with the experimental optical and electrochemical results. The higher HOMO energy of all compounds ranging between −4.90 and −5.12 eV compared to the HOMO of fullerene acceptors like PCBM (−6.0 eV) or C60 (−6.2 eV)39 suggests an efficient charge transfer, which in turn could enhance the open-circuit voltage (Voc).48 Similarly, the energetically higher LUMO position (−3.60 to −3.73 eV) of the compounds compared to that of the standard PCBM acceptor (−4.3 eV) ensures ideal donor behavior for effective charge separation to maximize the Voc of the solar cell.

For instance, the HOMO of analogues containing a mono-thiophene spacer (2a, −5.12 eV; 2c, −5.12 eV and 2d, −5.11 eV) is deeper than those with a more rigid thieno[3,2-b]thiophene spacer (2g, −5.07 eV and 2h, −5.07 eV). Chromophores with a 2,2′-bithiophene spacer (2b, −5.01 eV; 2e, −5.01 eV and 2f, −5.0 eV) showed an even higher HOMO, indicating a relatively decreased π-conjugation due to the enforced torsional effect between the two thiophene rings.49 For a similar reason, the compound with a terthiophene spacer (2i, −4.9 eV) would lead to larger perturbation of the backbone conjugation, thereby displaying the highest HOMO among all compounds. Moreover, the lowered LUMO level (−3.67 eV) in this system could be attributed to the existence of additional π-electrons with more thiophene units. It can also be argued that the HOMO energy of analogues containing electron-rich alkyl chains (2i, −4.90 eV and 2j, −4.92 eV) was estimated to be slightly higher than the non-alkylated analogues (2a–2h).50

Using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), we gained insights on parameters like electronic transition, major orbital contributions, oscillator strength and light harvesting efficiency (Fig S7 and Table S4, ESI†). The absorption in the IR and visible region of the electronic spectra was assigned to ICT and π–π* bands respectively. For all chromophores, the major vertical transition at these regions corresponds to the S0 → S1 transition. It was found that the oscillator strength (f) values consistent with ICT were considerably higher than that of π–π*. This observation suggests that the photon harvesting is largely contributed by ICT (HOMO → LUMO) compared to π–π* transition (HOMO → LUMO+1 or HOMO−1 → LUMO). As a consequence, the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) promoted by ICT is comparatively higher than that by π–π*. Despite the somewhat higher wavelength of simulated absorption compared to experimental UV-vis results, the spectral pattern was retained in good agreement. This minor discrepancy could be attributed to the possibility of neighbouring orbitals to show quasi-degenerate energy levels at the boundary region, which in turn result in imprecise description of the π-orbitals. To this end, the total density of states (TDOS) has been outlined in Fig S8 (ESI†), which represents the molecular orbitals composition as well as their contribution to chemical bonding.51
In order to understand the molecular structure, chemical stability and reactivity of the compounds, we derived the global chemical reactivity descriptors (GCRD) and other secondary quantum chemical parameters from the computed HOMO–LUMO energies (Table S5, ESI†).52 Since the polarizability of different dipolar chromophores could alter the electronic properties of n-type acceptor in the BHJ blend by varying donor–acceptor interactions, we computed the dipole moment (ρ).53 The high ρ values (22.6 to 28.7 D) observed for all chromophores is an indication of strong intermolecular interactions typical of a dipolar D–π–A molecule. Particularly, 2j bearing a –NBu2 donor fragment showed the highest ρ value of 28.7 D could stimulate an enhancement in the local concentration at the D–A interface. The computed chemical potential (μ) ranging between −4.26 and −4.42 eV is sufficiently higher than the standard acceptor PCBM (−4.92 eV),54 which is rather suggestive that the compounds could serve as donors against PCBM as the acceptor in p/n BHJ solar cells. Likewise, the chemical hardness (η) value of 0.61 to 0.74 eV is quite small compared to PCBM (2.35 eV), which is a sign of easy distribution of electrons from compounds to PCBM. In other words, the higher chemical softness (σ) of our compounds (1.35 to 1.63 eV) compared to PCBM (0.42 eV) further specifies their electron donating tendency. Because of the presence of four nitrile groups, the electronegativity (χ) values (4.26 to 4.42 eV) are slightly on the higher side, yet lower than PCBM (4.92 eV); indicating that the compounds are able to donate electrons to PCBM.
Thermal characteristics
Dipolar push–pull chromophores with a non-linear electron-accepting group have been developed to exhibit improved thermal stability in several instances.55 To assess thermal stability and structural changes, all compounds 2a–2j were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. TGA and DSC curves depicting the detailed degradation modes and structural changes are shown in Fig. S9 and S10 (ESI†) respectively. As shown in Table S6 (ESI†), the compounds are thermally stable with the first weight loss temperature (Td) of 5% found to be between 149 and 222 °C. In particular, 2j possessing the –NBu2 group displayed better thermal stability compared to –NPh2 analogues (2a–2i) which may be due to the compact molecular packing in the solid state. However, we don’t have any experimental proof for this reasoning, since it is not the focus of our present work. Nonetheless, all compounds showed adequate stability after the first weight loss temperature (Td) by retaining a substantial amount of mass, which is quite advantageous for high temperature device fabrication. The TGA curves showed the presence of surface bound moisture from the portion of curves around 90 °C. The reason for the surface bound moisture may be due to the capture of atmospheric moisture while weighing in the instrument pan. Despite this inevitable error, the first weight loss temperature (Td) obtained from TGA for all compounds retained sufficient mass balance. On the other hand, smooth flexion endotherms with a shape characteristic of a glass-transition (Tg) for all compounds was observed in DSC thermograms. An attempt to find out the melting point (Tm) in open-air capillaries did not display a clear transition from solid to liquid state. Therefore, we assigned this change to the decomposition temperature (Tdec) rather than melting point of respective compounds. Nevertheless, high Tdec values ranging from 145 to >250 °C obtained for all compounds indicate their higher thermal stability. However, DSC exhibited high melting points (Tm) for all compounds between 243 and 559 °C. This discrepancy in thermal values, Tdec from open-air capillaries and Tm from DSC, is because of the fact that open-air capillary works at atmospheric temperature, where the interference of oxygen could oxidize the compounds at the rising temperature. However, DSC and TGA are working as closed systems (inert condition) under a nitrogen or argon atmosphere avoiding unwanted chemical reactions.
BHJ solar cell results
To validate the potential applications of 2a–2j as donors in SMOSCS, we blended these with standard acceptor PCBM in a 1:1 ratio and constructed an inverted solar cell of ITO/ZnO/BHJ/V2O5/Ag configuration. The current–voltage (J–V) features of the best SMOSCs under illumination (AG1.5, 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 4. Under this condition, the obtained photovoltaic parameters like open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill-factor (FF) are summarized in Table 3. At the outset, a promising and much improved power conversion efficiency (η) ranging from 5.22 to 7.09% was accomplished. This superior efficiency compared to our previous TCNE series (1.95 to 3.33%)19a is rationalized to the much-reduced optical band gap appropriate to harvest low energy photons. Analysis of the OPV results led to the following inferences: (i) the active layer made of all chromophores (2a–2j) showed higher efficiency in comparison to a standard P3HT:PCBM device. (ii) 2j and 2i possessing peripheral alkyl chains emerged as the most effective with an η of 7.09 and 7.03% respectively. (iii) chromophores containing the 2-thienyl end group constructed on a bithiophene (2f) and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (2h) spacers turned out to be the second best among the screened series by exhibiting an η of 6.95 and 6.92% respectively. (iv) 2g with a thieno[3,2-b]thiophene spacer in conjunction with 3-thienyl end group was the third most efficient by showing η = 6.65%. (v) 2e (η = 6.34%) and 2d (η = 6.27%) in which bithiophene and monothiophene spacers were respectively attached with 3-thienyl and 2-thienyl end groups showed slightly reduced, yet comparable efficiency. Likewise, 2c with 3-thienyl end group and monothiophene spacer also displayed moderate performance with η = 5.75%. (vi) As a last series, chromophores with phenyl end groups exhibited an efficiency of η = 5.42% for 2b and η = 5.22% for 2a. It is apparent that the JSC for all cells is sufficiently large (11.39 to 16.13 mA cm−2) attributing to the extended absorption of 2a–2j in the electronic spectrum. In particular, the much higher JSC of the device based on 2j (16.13 mA cm−2) compared to others, ultimately emerged as the best candidate by exhibiting a high efficiency of 7.09%. Understandably, this can be reasoned to its extended absorption profile compared to the rest, thereby contributing significantly to the increase of power density. Although the JSC for all cells is quite high, only modest Voc (0.70 to 0.80 V) was observed, due to the slightly elevated HOMO levels of 2a–2j, thereby limiting the η of the device. This is due to the fact that Voc is directly related to the difference in energy between the HOMOdonor and LUMOacceptor.56 Gratifyingly, an enhanced FF for all cells ranging between 55 and 61.9% indicates good charge transport/collection properties of the active layer.57 Overall, it is to be remembered that the obtained η values (5.22 to 7.09%) from our findings are comparable with OPVs based on other twisted π-semiconductors so far reported.17

Active layer morphology
It is to be remembered that after several initial trials of donor:acceptor ratio, the optimum result was obtained for a blend ratio of 1:1 (wt/wt). Therefore, to unravel the role of acceptor concentration, the performance of the best device based on 2j was investigated by changing the PCBM weight ratio (1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4) and the corresponding J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. S11 and Table S7 (ESI†). It was found that the efficiency decreased gradually with respect to increase in acceptor concentration; (η = 4.01% for 1:2 wt/wt; η = 3.53% for 1:3 wt/wt and η = 3.37% for 1:4 wt/wt). Therefore, to understand the co-relation between the blend ratio and efficiency, field emission scanning electron microscopic (FESEM) investigation on active layer films of different ratios was performed. As shown in Fig. 5, a difference in morphologies with respect to various blend proportions was observed. The 1:1 blend showed interdigitated nanostructures in the film with better-quality interface and continuity. However, a 1:2 ratio exhibits the formation of isolated aggregates with a domain size of greater than 200 nm. A similar kind of overlarge phase domain with poor continuity of films is also observed for the active layer made of a 1:3 and 1:4 ratio. This agglomeration phenomenon could be ascribed to the large difference in specific surface energy which results in immiscibility of the D/A blend at a higher concentration of acceptor.58 As the exciton diffusion length of an ideal D/A blend is sufficiently small (10 nm), the aggregated domains formed at higher concentration could be detrimental to device efficiency.59 However, at a 1:1 ratio, the surface-energies between 2j and PCBM can be well-matched to form a homogeneous network, thereby favouring effective dissociation of excitons and charge transport. This investigation clearly revealed that a 1:1 ratio of D/A mixture is crucial to improvise the efficiency. Another possible explanation is that at higher concentration, the absorbance of PCBM could dominate over that of the donor, leading to a net reduction in absorbance of the active layer, which in turn could reduce the efficiency (Fig. S12, ESI†).60
 Fig. 5  FESEM morphological images (scale bar = 200 nm) of the 2j:PCBM blend at ratios of (a) 1:1 (wt/wt) and (b) 1:2 (wt/wt). 
In order to further enhance the performance, the best performed blend made of 2j:PCBM at a 1:1 weight ratio was subjected to solvent vapour annealing (SVA) using o-dichlorobenzene. As depicted in Fig. S11 and Table S7 (ESI†), the efficiency increased from 7.09% for pristine to 7.79% for SVA treated films. Therefore, to reveal the role of SVA processing in efficiency, atomic force microscopic images (AFM) of the pristine and annealed active layer were obtained (Fig. S13, ESI†). Apparently, the thickness and surface morphology of these films somewhat differ from each other and correlate with the J–V characteristics (Fig. S11 and Table S7, ESI†). As revealed by 3D topography and phase images, the root-mean square roughness of the pristine film (σRMS = 3.20 nm) slightly reduced after annealing (σRMS = 3.09 nm) along with minor uneven accumulation of the heterojunction morphology. Nevertheless, the lowered coarsening of the annealed film indicates an increased interface, which in turn is key for effective exciton dissociation at the p/n heterojunction.61 As mentioned in Table S6 (ESI†), the FF increased to 57.8% in the annealed film compared to the non-annealed film (55%). This suggests that annealing facilitates the decrease of space charge owing to the balance in hole and electron transport of the device.62 In addition, the JSC increased from 16.13 mA cm−2 for the pristine film to 17.07 mA cm−2 for the annealed film. This could possibly be attributed to the decrease in π–π stacking after annealing, thereby contributing to the increase of PCE. However, relative scattering patterns of pristine and annealed films from GIWAXS are necessary to conclude this rationale which is beyond the scope of the present work.63 Since solvent additives are known to enhance the nanoscale morphology of the BHJ layer, we also attempted 1% DIO (1,8-diiodooctane) in o-dichlorobenzene for processing.64 Contrastingly, the roughness (σRMS = 3.59 nm) enhanced after DIO treatment with a slight aggregation of phase. This morphology can be disadvantageous for an efficient photocurrent generation, due to the lack of effective interfacial area. This tendency correlates with the drastic reduction in η from 7.07 to 4.90% upon additive processing. Therefore, the net results from AFM suggest that SVA treatment is significant in improving the cell efficiency from 7.07 to 7.79%.
EQE, PL quenching and crystallinity
As shown in Fig. 6a, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of both pristine as well as annealed solar cells made of 2j:PCBM displayed wide photoresponses between 300 and 1200 nm, which is in parallel agreement with the absorption spectrum of the blend film (Fig. S12, ESI†). The resemblance of EQE spectra and thin-film absorption revealed that both acceptor and donor sections contribute to the photo-generated current. It is clear that EQE values are maximal for the annealed device compared to its pristine counterpart throughout the wavelength region. For the spectral peak at 938 nm, the annealed and as-cast fabricated cells showed an EQE of 71% and 65% respectively. The higher EQE is suggestive that annealing facilitates the photon to current conversion compared to the as-cast cells.
 Fig. 6  (a) EQE and (b) PL spectra of 2j:PCBM (pristine and annealed). 
The increase in efficiency, when the blend film was annealed can be corroborated to its increased dissociation efficiency after exciton formation compared to the as-cast film. Therefore, photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments were performed to provide the evidence for exciton dissociation, which in turn is a crucial factor to influence JSC.65 As shown in Fig. 6b, the pristine film of 2j:PCBM (1:1) blend exhibited a PL peak at 616 nm.66 However, the intensity of the same peak quenched effectively in the annealed film. This quenching in luminescence is suggestive of more effective exciton separation in the annealed film compared to the as-cast film. This investigation implies that annealing facilitates the optimal phase separated nanoscale morphology for better photoinduced charge transfer at the interfacial area between 2j and PCBM.
Yet another important factor for efficient exciton dissociation is the crystallinity of the active layer. To glean information on molecular packing, XRD patterns of the pristine and annealed active layer of 2j:PCBM were recorded (Fig. 7). A cursory analysis of the XRD pattern indicates that the pristine film exhibited relatively weak peaks suggesting a weak self-ordered structure of the blend. However, the peaks intensity increased significantly for the annealed film, indicating an increased crystallinity with respect to temperature. The as-cast films showed diffraction peaks at 2θ = 9.46, 9.72 and 9.93 with a d spacing of 9.33, 9.07 and 8.89 Å respectively. In the case of the annealed film, the diffraction is stronger with a negligible shift of peaks at 2θ = 9.54, 9.83 and 9.93 with a d spacing of 9.25, 8.98 and 8.89 Å. To calculate the crystallite size of the pristine and annealed films, the well-known Scherrer formula (D = Kλ/βcosθ) has been used. Here, D is the crystallite size, K is the dimensionless shape factor, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray beam, β is the full width half maximum (FWHM) and θ is the diffraction angle. Thus the calculated crystallite size of the pristine film at 2θ = 9.46 and 9.93 was found to be 1.46 and 1.95 nm respectively. Thus, the average crystallite size (D/2) of the pristine film is 1.70 nm. Likewise, the D value of the annealed film at 2θ = 9.54 and 9.93 was calculated to be 2.82 and 1.84 nm respectively with an average crystallite size of 2.33 nm. From this observation, it clearly suggests that the annealing process contributes slightly to increasing the crystallite size of the blend films.67 This increase in crystallinity is rather advantageous to increase the hole mobility and charge transport, which in turn is a crucial parameter to enhance the JSC and FF.68 For this reason, the annealed film exhibited better JSC (17.07 mA cm−2) and FF (57.8%) compared to the pristine blend (JSC = 16.13 mA cm−2; FF = 55%).

Charge transport properties
To obtain insight into the influence of SVA treatment on the charge transport properties, the space charge limited current (SCLC) scheme was employed to determine the electron and hole mobilities of the pre-annealed and annealed active layer using electron and hole only devices. As per the SCLC method, the current density can be represented by Mott–Gurney law: J = (9/8)μεoε(V2/L3).69 Here, V is the applied voltage, L is the film thickness, μ is the charge carrier (electron or hole) mobility, εo is the dielectric permittivity of free space and ε is the dielectric constant of the active layer. The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the 2j:PCBM BHJ films were calculated from the J–V characteristics on hole-only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ/Au) and electron-only (ITO/Al/BHJ/Al) devices respectively. The J–V features of hole-only devices of pristine and annealed BHJ films are shown in Fig. 8a, which clearly revealed a higher hole-mobility for annealed films (μh = 6.53 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) compared to pristine films (μh = 5.49 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Apparently, the change in electron mobilities after annealing (μe = 2.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) with respect to pristine films (μe = 2.59 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is negligible. This observation of improvement in hole mobility with not much change in electron mobility will favour more balanced charge transport properties within the BHJ active layer. Understandably, the photovoltaic parameters enhanced after annealing (FF = 57.8%; JSC = 17.07 mA/cm2) compared to the as-cast one (FF = 55%; JSC = 16. 13 mA cm−2).
 Fig. 8  (a) J–V characteristics of hole only devices based on the 2j:PCBM blend (pristine and annealed). 
In order to gain insight on the role of the trap-assisted recombination process against bimolecular recombination, we estimated the illumination intensity (Pin) dependence of the open-circuit voltage. As depicted in Fig. 8b, the plot of Voc shows a linear relationship with increase in Pin, with a slope of kT/q (where, q = electronic elementary charge, T = temperature and k = Boltzmann's constant) for second-order recombination.70 For the pristine and annealed BHJ layer, we found similar slope values of 1.35 and 1.30 kT/q respectively. The slightly reduced value of 1.30 kT/q indicates that annealing assists in reducing the trap-assisted bimolecular recombination compared to pristine, but not to a greater extent. Nevertheless, the decreased slope value of the annealed films is suggestive of a better heterojunction interface to favour better charge extraction. The high cell performance of the BHJ composite after annealing compared to the pristine form can also be inferred from the illumination intensity dependent short circuit current density (Fig. 8c). The change in JSC with respect to light intensity (Pin) can be explained by the power law, JSC ∝ (Pin)S. Here, S is the power-law scaling exponent and its value closer to 1 implies a negligible second-order recombination. The “S” for the as-cast and annealed active layer film was deduced to be 0.85 and 0.99 respectively. The greater “S” value for the annealed film solar cell compared to the pristine counterpart suggests the suppression of bimolecular recombination contributes to the balanced charge carrier mobilities,71 thereby increasing the JSC and FF after annealing.
For understanding the enhancement in JSC after annealing, we analysed the changes in charge photogeneration of the pre- and post-annealed cells. As depicted in Fig. 8d, the photocurrent density (Jph) changes with respect to the internal effective voltage (Veff) for both devices. Here, Jph = JL − JD, where JD and JL refer to the measured current density under dark and light conditions respectively. On the other hand, Veff = VO − Vapp with Vapp being the applied voltage and VO being the voltage at which Jph is zero. For the cells processed with a pristine and annealed active layer, the photocurrent starts to saturate at Veff = 1.69 V and 1.0 V respectively with a complete saturation at Veff = 2.5 V and 2.1 V respectively. Since the saturated photocurrent density is comparatively higher for the annealed (14.5 mA cm−2) over the pristine active layer (13.37 mA cm−2), it is indicative that annealing facilitates the generation of free charge carriers after exciton dissociation. This will in turn ensure the relatively better charge collection at the electrodes with suppressed bimolecular recombination, thereby contributing to the increase in FF.72
Conclusions
In summary, we have disclosed the synthesis of 10 new π-conjugated chromophores on a D–π–A format by incorporating tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) as the end group. The reported series of TCNQ based chromophores emerged as better performing donor materials for BHJ solar cells (η = 5.22 to 7.79%) compared to previously disclosed TCNE series (η = 1.95 to 3.33%). This sweeping increase in efficiency was comprehended to their favourable physical properties such as reduced optical energies, elevated HOMO positions and appropriate quantum chemical parameters as revealed by both experimental as well as theoretical calculations. Among 10 chromophores, the active layer using 2j as the donor material in combination with PCBM as the standard acceptor resulted in a high efficiency of 7.09%. Further optimization of the blend ratio of this particular active layer indicates that a 1:1 wt/wt is crucial for attaining good nanoscale morphology. Another key parameter which seems to influence the cell performance up to 7.79% was found to be solvent vapour annealing (SVA). The surface morphology, PL quenching studies and thin-film XRD also revealed that the active layer processed by annealing displays more favourable active layer properties to enhance the Jsc and FF. Our overall study validates that replacement of TCNE with a DCNQ module on the D–π–A conjugated backbone is advantageous not only for fine-tuning the optoelectronic properties but also for the inferior device efficiency. Looking from this perspective, there is plenty of scope to enhance the cell efficiency of other chromophores also by fine-tuning an array of device fabrication parameters. Hence, we are currently exploring the device engineering of all the synthesized chromophores as active layer materials and the compiled results will be reported shortly. In parallel, we are directing our studies to understand the role of TCNQ acceptors on the physical properties of other forms of D–A architectures and their influence on molecular devices.
