    , Accepted 12th April 2019First published on 15th April 2019AbstractTwo novel sensitizers, 2a and 2b, with D/A–π–D–π–A architectures were designed and synthesized based on a phenothiazine framework connected via ethylene with 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl (A) and p-methoxyphenyl (D), and with cyanoacrylic acid as an anchoring group, acting as an acceptor (A). A comparative analysis was performed to investigate the effect of the electronic character of end-capped D and A groups on the photophysical properties and photovoltaic performance of 2a and 2b. The optical, thermal, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the dyes were thoroughly investigated and confronted with DFT and TD-DFT calculations. Compound 2b of D–π–D–π–A type showed better photovoltaic parameters, which verify the general trends, although the parameters for compound 2a of A–π–D–π–A type do not differ significantly from those for 2b. The metal-free 2a and 2b-based DSSC devices exhibited higher power conversion efficiencies of 6.11% (2a) and 5.03% (2b) compared to 3.56% for the N719-based device.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, new solutions in the area of renewable energy are desirable because of the inevitable depletion of non-renewable energy sources. The effective conversion of solar energy into electricity occupies an important place in scientific research. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on metal-free components are an attractive alternative to those composed of Ru complex sensitizers (N719, N3, and N749) due to their easy production processes, flexibility in tuning the molecular architecture, easy purification, compliance with environmental regulations, high power conversion energy (PCE) and potentially low cost.1–7 The DSSC has a sandwich structure and is a photoelectrochemical system consisting of a TiO2 layer, redox electrolyte, a counter electrode and a dye sensitizer.8–10 A particularly important element of the whole system is the dye sensitizer as well as the porous oxide layer applied onto a semiconducting, transparent substrate. Dye molecules are attached to the surface of the oxide layer, forming a bond between the surface hydroxyl group of TiO2 and the carboxylic moiety in the dye molecule's structure.11,12 The high photovoltaic performance of the DSSC is dependent on the processes occurring at the interface between the semiconducting metal oxide, the dye, and the electrolyte. At the dye/metal oxide interface, the potential of the excited state of the dye is required to be sufficiently negative in order to inject an electron into the metal oxide conduction band effectively.13
Phenothiazine (PTZ) is a heterocyclic compound that contains both electron-rich sulfur atoms and a nitrogen atom. Due to the construction of the skeleton, phenothiazine is a strong electron-donating group widely used in donor–acceptor (D–A) systems with significant photophysical properties. Furthermore, in the ground state, phenothiazine has a non-planar conformation (“butterfly structure”), which can significantly suppress molecular aggregation and the formation of intermolecular excimers.14 Thus, phenothiazine was successfully applied, in addition to optoelectronics15,16 and medicine,17–19 as a photosensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).20–28
Recently, numerous phenothiazine derivatives of the D–π–A type have been obtained by multi-stage syntheses and studied as a sensitizer in DSSCs.21–28 Yong et al. synthesized a series of phenothiazine D–D–π–A dyes with a cyanoacrylate anchoring group, a 4-(hexyloxy)phenyl group at the 7-position of PTZ as an additional donor moiety, and with different lengths of the alkyl chain (ethyl, hexyl, octyl, dodecyl) at the N atom of phenothiazine. It has been shown that varying the alkyl chain length at the N atom of PTZ has a considerable impact on the photovoltaic performance, where PTZ with a hexyl chain has the highest PCE (8.18%) compared to the standard Ru-based N719 (7.73%).21 Organic dyes with a D–D–π–A architecture based on phenothiazine (D), with and without indolo[2,3-b]quinoxaline (D), thiophene (π-bridge), and cyanoacrylic acid (A) showed excellent photovoltaic performances under a standard 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 G) irradiation with a high PCE ranging from 6.82 to 8.28%. It has been established that the incorporation of an additional donor, such as indoloquinoxaline, to a phenothiazine-thiophene dye will result in a higher short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) ranging from 14.0 to 15.3 mA cm−2 and a higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) ranging from 705 to 557 mV, and achieve a superior PCE.22 The influence of terminal donor groups in D–D–π–A dyes (WR8-WR10) based on PTZ donors on the light-harvesting, electrochemical properties, and photovoltaic performance was studied.23 The exchange of the terminal donor from carbazole in WR8 to the bulky N-phenyl-9,9-dipropyl-N-(9,9-dipropyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-9H-fluoren-2-amine (DPFA) (WR10) extends the conjugation of the dye but leads to the hypsochromic-shifted absorption with a worse molar extinction coefficient. This was explained by the much lower probability of a HOMO to LUMO transition for the dye with DPFA compared to other dyes, as supported by DFT calculations. The WR8 dye with a simple terminal donor achieved the highest overall conversion efficiency of 7.13% under standard AM 1.5 sunlight.23 The modification of oligothiophene incorporated as the π linker in the organic dyes based on PTZ (JY31-33) in a D–D–π–A type of DSSC was presented.26 The incorporation of alkyl chains in oligothiophene and the 4-butoxyphenyl group in phenothiazine moiety suppressed the intermolecular π–π stacking of the organic dye and resulted in a high PCE of 7.48%, whereas the PCE for N719 was 9.01% under standard conditions.26
The effect due to the variation of π-spacers (benzene, furan, thiophene) in dyes based on PTZ on the photoelectric properties was studied and compared with that of the dye without a π-spacer.27 The dyes containing thiophene and furan π-spacers were found to be superior to that with a modified benzene spacer. Moreover, the general effect due to the introduction of a modified benzene π-spacer was worse than those due to the dye with a thiophene and furan π-spacer and even the dye without a spacer. The best photovoltaic performance was achieved for thiophene and furan spacers with an overall PCE of up to 4.34%.27 The impact of the number of anchoring groups of PTZ dyes (TP2, T2P2, and TP3) containing triarylamine as the additional donor and the bridging group was demonstrated, where the importance of the double donor unit toward the DSSC performance was evident in comparison to the mono-anchoring type (TP). Although the di-anchoring dyes showed good conversion efficiencies of 6.60–7.06%, even better DSSC performance was found when T2P2 bearing two additional donors was used as a sensitizer, which was due to its high VOC and high charge transfer resistance.28 The above results revealed that the structural modification of PTZ derivatives by the incorporation of additional donor groups, the number of anchoring moieties, or a substituent at the N atom of PTZ is particularly important to attain high efficiency and long-term stability of DSSCs.
In this work, we synthesized two novel sensitizers based on a phenothiazine framework (2a and 2b) with a D/A–π–D–π–A architecture. Our strategy was to elongate the π-conjugation by ethylene-linked phenothiazine with D and A groups first, and second, to introduce donor and acceptor moieties, p-methoxyphenyl and (3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl), respectively, at the 7-position of PTZ and determine their effective impact on the photophysical and thermal properties and photovoltaic performance.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and instruments
All chemicals and starting materials were obtained from commercial sources and were used without further purification. All reactions were carried out under an argon atmosphere. Column chromatography was carried out on Merck silica gel. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on silica gel (Merck TLC Silica Gel 60). The NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 MHz instrument using DMSO-d6 as a solvent. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) measurements were conducted by using a Mass Spectrometer QTOF (Impact HD, Bruker). The samples were weighed and dissolved in chloroform to give a sample concentration of 1 mg mL−1. The samples were then diluted 10–10000 times with a solution of water:acetonitrile 10:90 (v/v) with the addition of a mixture of 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate in acetonitrile and water 90:10 (v/v). Other instrument characterization is presented in the ESI.†

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis
The two novel phenothiazine derivatives (2a–2b) of A/D–π–D–π–A type, containing 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl and p-methoxyphenyl moieties connected via an acetylene linker with a phenothiazine ring, were synthesized by the widely used Knoevenagel condensation of 1a and 1b with cyanoacetic acid (Scheme 1). The compounds were isolated in high yields (85–90%) and characterized by NMR and mass spectroscopic techniques (ESI†).

3.2 Thermal properties
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were carried out to determine the thermal properties of the examined phenothiazine derivatives 2a and 2b. The TGA and DSC measurements were conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 15° and 20 °C min−1, respectively. The obtained TGA/DTG and DSC thermograms are presented in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†), and the data are compiled in Table 1.

The studied molecules 2a and 2b are thermally stable; a 5% weight loss of each sample occurred at 232 °C for 2a and 258 °C for 2b. The same tendency for T10% was observed, wherein 10% weight loss occurred at a higher temperature for 2b in comparison to that of 2a. The first derivative of the TGA curve (DTG) shows the number of maximum decomposition rate, which is higher for 2a (five Tmax values), whereas for 2b two Tmax values were observed. The char residues at 900 °C for 2a and 2b were almost the same. The novel dyes 2a and 2b possess a low decomposition temperature, but are still satisfactorily high compared to those of 1a and 1b due to the presence of a more stable formyl group in the latter. DSC measurements revealed that the prepared phenothiazine derivatives 2a and 2b were partially amorphous, and showed a glass transition temperature (Tg) at 49 and 65 °C for 2a and 2b, respectively (Table 1). Compound 2b has a higher melting temperature (Tm) than 2a, whereas the Tg is similar.
3.3 Theoretical studies
The theoretical calculations were performed by using the methods based on the DFT (density functional theory) and TD-DFT (time-dependent density functional theory) with the B3LYP exchange–correlation functional with a 6-31G** basis set using the Gaussian 09 program.29 All calculations were conducted in a chloroform solution in the polarisable continuous model (PCM). The results of the TD-DFT calculations are discussed in the section dedicated to optical properties. First, the geometries of 2a and 2b were optimized, as presented in Table 2. The percentage contribution of particular components of the molecules in the frontier orbitals (HOMOs and LUMOs), energies of these orbitals and values of energy gaps (ΔE) are also presented in Table 2.

The energy gap in 2a (2.93 eV) is higher than that in 2b (2.69 eV) due to the significant differences between the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbitals of particular molecules. Moreover, due to the various electron affinity of the substituents, i.e. accepting 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl and donating 4-methoxyphenyl, the significant differences in contribution in the creation of HOMOs was observed. In the case of 2a, the acceptor group causes the localization of the highest occupied molecular orbital clearly on the phenothiazine motif (86%), whereas substituent participation equals 4%. The acetylene linker and anchoring group (–CHC(CN)COOH) are involved in 5% each. In contrast to 2a, 2b with donor groups has HOMO contributions consisting of 65% of phenothiazine followed by 20% of the substituent, 11% of acetylene linker, and 4% of the anchoring group. The LUMOs of the studied molecules 2a and 2b are located on the anchoring group with contributions of 64 and 61%, respectively. A deep insight into the optimized geometries of 2a and 2b showed that the substituents are coplanar in relation to phenothiazine whereas the characteristic “butterfly structure” of phenothiazine exhibited an angle of 138.04° for 2a and 138.35° for 2b between the two planes (butterfly's wings) in the ground state. The values of the same angles in the first excited state are larger, 155.20° and 157.32°, respectively for 2a and 2b (Fig. 1), which is in accordance with the literature data.30 Moreover, in the ground state, the anchoring group in the case of 2a is twisted 43.47° in relation to the plane of phenothiazine whereas the same group for 2b is coplanar.

The theoretical investigations were extended to calculations of the structures of dye-sensitized solar cells, which can be presented as the system type dye/TiO2. The quantum-chemical calculations were performed at the same level of theory B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) with the LANL2DZ basis set for Ti atoms. Based on the literature data,31,32 the (TiO2)9 cluster was implemented in order to reproduce the appropriate properties of dye-TiO2 systems. The starting Cartesian coordinates were prepared based on the chemisorption model33 with the geometry of the (TiO2)9 cluster described in the literature.34 The results of the conducted calculations are presented in Table 3. The HOMO localizations for 2a/(TiO2)9 and 2b/(TiO2)9 is very similar to those of the corresponding dyes 2a and 2b, but the LUMOs are localized only on the (TiO2)9 cluster, which is the commonly observed tendency for this kind of system.35 The calculated energy gap for 2a/(TiO2)9 (2.12 eV) is higher than that for 2b/(TiO2)9 (1.86 eV), similar to the dyes. The optimized geometries did not show any significant differences between the optimized dye 2a and 2b and their corresponding dye-TiO2 systems (Fig. S4, ESI†).

3.4 Photophysical properties and TD-DFT study
The absorption and emission spectra of the novel 2a and 2b dyes were recorded in a chloroform solution and the photophysical parameters are presented in Table 4. The absorption spectra for both compounds consist of two main maxima in the range of 250–550 nm (Fig. 2a). The high energetic band located between 250 and 350 nm is assigned to the π–π* transition, whereas the broad band situated in the range of 370–560 nm corresponds to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).36–38 The ICT band of 2b with a p-methoxyphenyl (D) group is slightly (about 5 nm) red-shifted from that of 2a with the 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl (A) moiety, indicating that the character of an additional D or A group has an imperceptible impact on the profile of the absorption spectrum. The similar value of the molar extinction coefficient for both dyes (ε = 10000 M−1 cm−1) confirms this phenomenon.

 Fig. 2  (a) Absorption and (b) photoluminescence spectra of 2a and 2b in chloroform solution (c = 10−5 mol L−1). 
Moreover, time-dependent density functional theory calculations (TD-DFT) with different functionals (B3LYP, M06, CAM-B3LYP, wB97XD) were employed to find the best correlation of experimental absorption with theoretical data (Table 5). The absorption spectra of 2a and 2b dyes predicted by all four functionals resemble the experimental profile (Fig. S3, ESI†). However, among the applied functionals, the results from CAM-B3LYP and wB97XD showed a considerable deviation in the absorption maxima values (mainly of ICT band), whereas B3LYP and M06 had good agreement with the experimental results. Therefore, we relied on DFT and TD/DFT calculations with B3LYP and M06 functionals to analyse the absorption with an emphasis on the ICT band, energy gap, and dipole moment of 2a and 2b dyes. The ICT absorption band computed with functional M06 coincides with the experimental data and in the case of B3LYP, is red-shifted by around 40 nm for both dyes. The strength of the oscillator of the ICT band for 2b (f = 0.50) is higher than that for 2a (f = 0.44), corresponding to the lower energy band gap for 2b (Table S1, ESI†). The optical band gap for 2a and 2b was determined to be 2.30 and 2.26 eV, respectively, which is in good agreement with the theoretically (TD/DFT with B3LYP) calculated band gaps. Nevertheless, a noticeable discrepancy was observed between band gap values obtained from other methods in the range of 3.14–6.64 eV, although the trend of a higher Eg for 2b was noticeable in all methods.

The ICT absorption bands originate mainly from the HOMO → LUMO transition from donor to acceptor moieties comprising 98% share. The efficient light absorption and charge separation in DSSCs depend on efficient electron transfer from donor to acceptor units, which requires good electron injection from the excited dyes. The contribution of the relevant components of 2a and 2b to the HOMO–LUMO transitions indicates the desired charge separation and electron transfer from donor to acceptor and the predisposition of presented dyes to demonstrate an excellent photovoltaic performance.
The comparison of the calculated absorption spectra of 2a and 2b with their analogs containing a (TiO2)9 cluster showed the significant differences between the absorptions’ maxima with the lowest energy (Fig. S5, ESI†). The bands for 2a/(TiO2)9 and 2b/(TiO2)9 are shifted towards longer wavelengths by 42 nm for 2a/(TiO2)9 and 27 nm for 2b/(TiO2)9 (Table S2, ESI†).
The lowest energy bands were analyzed using the Natural Transition Orbitals (NTOs), which are presented in Table S3 (ESI†) and Table 6 for 2a and 2b, respectively. The nature of the excited states, which are associated in the absorption spectra, is represented by the hole/electron pair. The “holes” represent the occupied transition orbitals, whereas “electrons” are unoccupied transition orbitals. Due to the complexity of the dominant molecular orbitals that take part in the creation of the particular absorption band, the NTO analyses allow us to obtain information about the representative transitions. For system 2a/(TiO2)9, excited states S4, S5, S6, and S9 can be distinguished, whereas in the case of 2b/(TiO2)9, S6, S8, and S9 are visible. The “holes” in both cases are identical to the highest occupied orbitals, but the “electrons” are localized mainly on various parts of the (TiO2)9 cluster with the contribution of phenothiazine.

The calculated ground state dipole moment using TD/DFT methods (Table S4, ESI†) for both dyes was comparable and large of 10.2 D. The dipole moment in vacuum for 2b is higher than that for 2a that are determined to be 9.11 and 8.65 D, respectively, clearly showing the influence of the electron-donating nature of p-methoxyphenyl in 2b confirmed by its direction (Table 7). However, calculations in the chloroform solution indicate that 2a with an electron-withdrawing 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group possesses a slightly higher dipole moment than 2b, facilitating the effective and intense ICT band for 2b, which is consistent with the experimental absorption spectrum.

To further assess the impact of peripheral units (3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl and p-methoxyphenyl) in 2a and 2b on their properties, we measured the emission spectra and determined the quantum yields and lifetimes of 2a and 2b in chloroform solutions (Fig. 2b and Table 4). The recorded emission spectra for 2a and 2b are identical in shape with a maximum at 572 and 574 nm, respectively. Both dyes are weakly emissive with fluorescence efficiencies of 15% (2a) and 18% (2b). The high quenching of fluorescence is caused by ICT. The fluorescence decay curves for 2a and 2b were bi-exponentially fit, in which the second decay components can be associated with the efficient lifetime value. The effective lifetimes of 2a (4.54 ns) and 2b (2.89 ns) are rather short suggesting that the fluorescence may originate from an ICT excited state.
Preliminary investigation of the photophysical properties supported by TD/DFT calculations offers broad insight into the influence of the electronic ability of a peripheral D or A moiety in 2a and 2b on their optical behavior, and in addition, is evidence that many photophysical parameters should be taken into account in order to consider the best photovoltaic predispositions of dyes.
3.5 Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical behavior of samples 2a and 2b in a chloroform (CHCl3) solution was investigated by two techniques, namely, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The electrochemical data are presented in Table 8.

The ionization potentials (IP) and electron affinities (EA) of the samples were calculated using the electrochemical oxidation and reduction onset potentials, respectively. It was assumed that the IP of ferrocene (Fc) equals −5.1 eV.39 The calculated ionization potential values and the electrochemical band-gap energy (Eg) are presented in Table 8. For PTZ-based compounds, the onset of the reduction peak was recorded at the potential of −1.99 V vs. Fc/Fc+ for 2a and −1.88 V vs. Fc/Fc+ for 2b (Fig. 3). The peak is better resolved for the electron-withdrawing 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl derivative and corresponds to the incorporation of the electron into the acceptor part of the D–A dye system.
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms recorded during the reduction of 2a and 2b in CHCl3. The measurements were performed with a platinum working electrode and referenced against the Fc/Fc+ couple; sweep rate v = 50 mV s−1. 
The oxidation potential of PTZ-based dyes is 0.31 V vs. Fc/Fc+ for 2a and 0.38 V vs. Fc/Fc+ for 2b. The first redox system corresponds to the oxidation of the PTZ part of the molecule.40,41 Its low value reflects the electron-donating nature of the PTZ ring. The lower oxidation potential for the 2a system reflects its higher likelihood for oxidation in comparison to the 2b one. Although the electron donating p-methoxyphenyl substituent is present in 2b, while 2a contains an electron-withdrawing 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group, it seems that it is mainly the PTZ core unit that predominantly influences the first oxidation potential value. The further oxidation steps can also be visible with two sequential oxidation stages. The electrochemically determined Eg value is 2.30 eV for 2a and 2.26 eV for 2b. These values are identical with the optical band gaps and in accordance with the Eg order found with DFT calculations.
3.6 DSSCs characterization
DSSC devices were fabricated based on the obtained phenothiazine derivatives 2a and 2b as sensitizers, and the structure is presented in Fig. 4a. Moreover, the reference device containing N719 was prepared. All of the devices were prepared in the same way. The immersion time in the appropriate dye solution was 24 h.
 Fig. 4  (a) Scheme of prepared solar cells and (b) energy level diagram of HOMO, LUMO and Eg values of phenothiazine derivatives determined by DFT together with the conduction band of TiO2 and redox potential of I3−/I− redox couple.32 
Before focusing on the photovoltaic parameters, it is useful to discuss the frontier orbital energy levels of the synthesized compounds in relation to the device layers, the UV-Vis absorption of TiO2 with absorbed dyes and its morphology. Since the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of dyes are important for the evaluation of the electron injection and dye regeneration efficiency, the energy level diagram of applied sensitizers together with the TiO2 conduction band edge and the redox potential of I3−/I− are presented in Fig. 4b. As can be seen, the LUMOs and HOMOs of the tested compounds are higher and lower than the TiO2 conduction band edge and the oxygen reduction potential of the I3−/I− couple, respectively. Thus, the photogenerated electrons at the LUMOs can be injected into the conduction band of the TiO2 semiconductor, whereas appropriately located HOMOs enable the regeneration of the oxidized dye by the transfer of the electrons from the electrolyte. The energy gaps decrease in the order of N719, 2a, and 2b. Next, the light harvesting ability of compounds after binding to TiO2 was evaluated. The registered and simulated UV-Vis spectra of such systems are depicted in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Experimental and calculated UV-Vis spectra of adsorbed compounds on TiO2. 
Compared with the compounds in solution, the maximum absorption wavelength of the dye binding to the semiconductor was bathochromically shifted to 463 and 458 nm for 2a and 2b, respectively, due to the interaction between the compounds and TiO2. However, the absorption band of 2b on TiO2 was broadened to the lower energy region (Fig. S6, ESI†). The morphology of the TiO2 surface and TiO2 with adsorbed dyes was analysed for the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The RMS of the anodes were found to be 92, 75 and 37 for the TiO2 layer, with anchored 2a and 2b, respectively. Thus, the photoanode with anchored 2b exhibited the smallest RMS value. The smoother photoanode surface may be a result of filling some of the pores with dye molecules, which may lead to better device performance and PV parameters.42 Considering the discussed parameters, it can be expected that compound 2b has more potential as a sensitizer in DSSCs.
Finally, the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the prepared cells were measured. The obtained photovoltaic parameters, such as the short-circuit current (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and the power conversion efficiency (PCE), are collected in Table 9, whereas the photocurrent density–voltage curves of the DSSCs are given in Fig. 6.

It was found that the devices prepared on the basis of phenothiazine derivatives demonstrated better photovoltaic performances than the tested solar cell containing a commercial metal-dye (N719). In our experimental conditions, the DSSC bearing N719 reached an efficiency of 3.56%. It should be noted that in the literature, DSSCs based on N719 exhibited various efficiencies ranging from 1.95 to 8.87% depending on the kind of electrolyte and other supporting materials and procedures applied for device preparation.43–47 The highest PCE (6.21%) was measured from the DSSC with a p-methoxyphenyl moiety connected via an acetylene linker with the phenothiazine ring (2b). The best conversion efficiency of this device results from the improved electron injection and less dark current, as indicated by the higher JSC (16.74 mA cm−2) and VOC (759 mV). It can be concluded that the presented phenothiazine derivatives seem to be promising materials for further studies as novel, cheaper, easier to synthesize metal-free dyes for solar cells.
4. Conclusions
Two dyes, 2a and 2b, with D/A–π–D–π–A architectures were designed and synthesized based on phenothiazine (PTZ) bearing 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl (A) and p-methoxyphenyl (D) groups connected via an acetylene linker with PTZ and cyanoacrylic acid as an anchoring group (A). The influence of the end-capped D and A groups in dyes 2a and 2b on the thermal, electrochemical and photophysical properties was thoroughly studied and discussed using DFT/TD-DFT theoretical calculations. The DSSC devices based on 2a and 2b displayed a high PCE of 5.03% and 6.21%, respectively, with respect to the reference N719-based dye (3.56%). The photovoltaic performance of 2b with the D–π–D–π–A architecture revealed a potential short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 16.74 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) of 756 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.49, showing that the additional donor (p-methoxyphenyl) and elongation of π-conjugation (acetylene linker) is advantageous in the design of photosensitizers applied in DSSCs. Moreover, dye 2a (A–π–D–π–A architecture) with an electron-acceptor (3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) group demonstrated a slightly lower PCE of 5.03% with insignificantly lower photovoltaic parameters than 2b, suggesting that it can also be successfully used as a photosensitizer in DSSC devices.
