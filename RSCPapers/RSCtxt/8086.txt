    , Accepted 17th January 2020First published on 18th January 2020AbstractBoron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)-based conjugated materials can show absorption spectra in the near-infrared (NIR) region, but organic solar cells (OSCs) based on these materials as donors provide an unsatisfactory photo-response, low photocurrent and hence low performance. Herein, a small band gap BODIPY-polymer as a donor combined with a fused ring electron acceptor was applied into non-fullerene OSCs, producing a broad photo-response from 300 nm to 1000 nm and hence a high short-circuit current density of over 21 mA cm−2. As a consequence, a record efficiency of 9.86% was obtained for the BODIPY-polymer, indicating its potential applications in semitransparent devices.
Boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)-based conjugated materials possess unique optical and electrochemical properties, such as outstanding photothermal stability, high molar extinction coefficients and high photoluminescence quantum yields.1 In addition, the BODIPY core can be easily linked with functional groups to afford numerous materials2–4 with widespread applications in the fields of biochemistry5–8 and organic electronics.9–12 Particularly, absorption spectra of BODIPY-based materials can be easily extend to the near-infrared (NIR) region, which is beneficial for harvesting sunlight. So that, these molecules have been widely applied for organic solar cells (OSCs) in the past few years.13,14 For example, a BODIPY-polymer pendant with porphyrin units was used for OSCs and realized a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.8%.15 The PCE for a BODIPY-thiophene copolymer as donor could be enhanced to 9.3%.16 However, the PCEs based on BODIPY-conjugated materials are still far lagging behind traditional non-fullerene OSCs with PCEs over 16%.17–21 One of the drawbacks is their relatively low short-circuit current density (Jsc < 17 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. 1a) despite their excellent absorption properties in the NIR region. For comparison, porphyrin with four pyrrole units in a single core is similar with BODIPY and has also been applied into designing conjugated materials for OSCs, in which PCEs over 13% and Jscs over 20 mA cm−2 have been realized.22–27 Since the BODIPY core contains two pyrrole units, it has simplified synthetic routes while showing similar optical properties as porphyrin derivatives. Therefore, a rational molecular design involving BODIPY-conjugated materials is very important for realizing high Jscs and PCEs in OSCs.

In our previous study, we found that methyl units have a significant impact on the photovoltaic performance of BODIPY polymers.28 The methylation of the BODIPY core at the α-position could tune the frontier energy levels to a high position, enhance the absorption coefficient and provide high hole mobility for the polymer PMBBDT (Fig. 1b); all-polymer solar cells based on PMBBDT as a donor and a naphthalene diimide-based polymer as an acceptor provided a PCE of 5.8%. In addition, we are interested in the design and synthesis of halogenated conjugated materials. Several halogenated fused-ring electron acceptors were developed via a simple and efficient Knoevenagel condensation.29 It was found that the halogenated materials could not only provide high electron mobilities in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) but also high PCEs in OSCs. We propose that the combination of PMBBDT as a donor and halogenated fused-ring electron acceptors could solve the low Jscs in OSCs.
With these motivations, herein, we studied OSCs based on the methylated BODIPY-polymer PMBBDT as a donor and two chlorinated electron acceptors (ITIC-2Cl and BTP-2Cl, Fig. 1c and d). Both the donor and acceptor exhibit absorption spectra in the NIR region, providing a high Jscs of above 21 mA cm−2 in OSCs with a broad photo-response range from 300 nm to 1000 nm. Therefore, a record PCE of 9.86% based on the PMBBDT as donor could be obtained. Considering their photo-response in the NIR region and the high photocurrent, we envision that these OSCs have potential applications in semitransparent devices.30
The donor polymer PMBBDT and the acceptor ITIC-2Cl29 were prepared according to our previous study. The acceptor BTP-2Cl was synthesized via procedures similar to those for the acceptor Y6,17 as shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). All the conjugated materials exhibit absorption spectra in the NIR region (Fig. 2a). This property will ensure their light-harvesting ability in the NIR region and hence enhance the Jscs in the OSCs. The frontier energy levels of these conjugated materials as determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement are shown in Fig. 2b and Table S1 (ESI†). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level offset between PMBBDT and ITIC-2Cl/BTP-2Cl is about 0.25 eV. This result ensures a sufficient driving force for charge separation in the non-fullerene OSCs.49

The excellent absorption properties and suitable energy levels of both PMBBDT and the electron acceptors inspired us to fabricate OSCs for which the inverted configuration of the ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag was used. The photoactive layers containing PMBBDT as the donor and ITIC-2Cl/BTP-2Cl as the acceptor were carefully optimized, including the amount of additive (1,8-diiodooctane, DIO), the ratio of donor to acceptor and the thickness of the active layers (Tables S2–S5, ESI†). The optimized J–V characteristics are presented in Fig. 3, and the corresponding parameters of these cells are summarized in Table 1. The PMBBDT:ITIC-2Cl-based cell had a PCE of 7.56% due to the limited Jsc of 17.4 mA cm−2, while the PMBBDT:BTP-2Cl cell provided a higher Jsc of 21.44 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 9.86%. This result represents the highest PCE with a BODIPY-conjugated material as an electron donor. Interestingly, although the donor and acceptor show a low absorption intensity in the visible region, their photo-responses in this region are comparable with those in the NIR region (EQE above 0.5, Fig. 3b). This property partially contributed to the high Jscs in these cells.

To compare the reported PCEs over 16%,17–21 the performance in these cells still requires optimization. When using the optical modelling with the wavelength-dependent refractive indices and extinction coefficients of all the layers in the devices, we could determine the theoretical Jscs and the internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) of the cells, as shown in Fig. 3c and d.50 Both of the cells show IQEs above 0.70 with a maximum at 0.80, so the theoretical Jscs for the PMBBDT:BTP-2Cl (100 nm) cells could be over 27 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3c). However, this cell with its 100 nm photo-active layers showed significantly reduced FF, resulting in low PCEs. In another aspect, we determined the energy of the charge transfer state (ECT) of these cells using a highly sensitive EQE (sEQE) by using the Marcus theory51 (Fig. 3e and f), in which both of the cells performed with a similar ECT (Table 1). In addition, we found that the electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) of the PMBBDT:BTP-2Cl cell is higher than that of the PMBBDT:ITIC-2Cl cell (Fig. S2, ESI†), suggesting a lower non-radiative recombination voltage loss (ΔVnon-rad) in the PMBBDT:BTP-2Cl cells (Table 1), which explains its higher Voc. The energy loss (Eloss), determined as the difference between the optical band gap and eVoc, is 0.54 eV for the PMBBDT:BTP-2Cl cells, which is among the lowest Eloss in non-fullerene solar cells.52
These analyses clearly demonstrate that the relatively low PCEs in BODIPY-based polymer solar cells originate from the low FFs. In general, FF in OSCs is determined by the phase separation in the blended thin films and the charge carrier mobilities. The surface morphology of the two blends was probed via atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 4a, b and Fig. S3 (ESI†). Both films show fibrillar structures on the surface, indicating strong aggregation/crystallinity of PMBBDT, which is beneficial for charge transport in OSCs. Two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was further used to investigate the crystalline behavior of these blended films (Fig. 4c and d). The diffraction patterns and corresponding crystallographic parameters are shown in Fig. S4 and Table S6 (ESI†). Both the polymer donors and acceptors in these blends present a face-on orientation, with the diffraction peak (100) at q ≈ 0.30 A−1 in the in-plane direction (corresponding to lamellar stacking) and the peak (010) at q ≈ 1.67 A−1 in the out-of-plane direction (corresponding to π–π stacking). The coherence length (CL) of the peaks in the PMBBDT:BTP-2Cl film is higher than that of the PMBBDT:ITIC-2Cl film, indicating the better crystallinity in the PMBBDT:BTP-2Cl film. From the AFM and GIWAXS measurements, we infer that the phase separation in the blends is not responsible for the low FFs in these cells.

We further studied the charge transport properties of these cells by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S5, ESI†). The hole and electron mobilities are summarized in Table S7 (ESI†). Both the PMBBDT:ITIC-2Cl and PMBBDT:BTP-2Cl cells provided high hole and electron mobilities, demonstrating their ordered microstructures. Notably, the hole mobilities are one order of magnitude higher than the electron mobilities, causing unbalanced charge transport and enhancing charge recombination. This result explains the relatively low FFs in the PMBBDT-based cells.
In conclusion, BODIPY-based polymer donors and chlorinated electron acceptors with absorption spectra in the NIR region were applied for use in OSCs, in which a broad photo-response from 300 nm to 1000 nm with an EQE above 0.50 was realized. As a consequence, a high Jsc above 21 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 9.86% were obtained, which also represent the highest photocurrent and efficiency among OSCs based on BODIPY-polymer donors. These results demonstrate that BODIPY polymers have great potential applications for high performance OSCs. The development of new BODIPY polymers such as focusing on extending the π-conjugated backbones, introducing heteroatoms (O, S, F and Cl) and changing the copolymerized units as well as investigating naphthalene diimide/perylene diimide derivatives as potential electron acceptors to match with the BODIPY-polymer donors, are in progress in our lab.
