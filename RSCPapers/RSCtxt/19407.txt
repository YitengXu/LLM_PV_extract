    , Accepted 10th April 2012First published on 13th April 2012AbstractMonodisperse TiO2 hollow spheres assembled by nanospindles were prepared via the facile hydrothermal reaction of peroxotitanium complex precursors. Time dependent trails revealed that the shape evolution involved a one-step chemical conversion from amorphous Ti complex microspheres to anatase TiO2 hierarchical hollow spheres. Meanwhile, the sizes of the spheres could be tuned in a region of 400–1000 nm by simply adjusting the ammonia dosage of the precursor solution. Furthermore, these as-prepared hollow spheres were deposited as a scattering layer on top of the TiO2 nanocrystalline film, and a high energy conversion efficiency of 8.10% was demonstrated based on the bilayer photoanode, in contrast to a 7.29% conversion efficiency for the cell with a pure nanocrystalline photoanode.
1. Introduction
Since the breakthrough report in 1991, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been considered as a promising candidate for next generation low-cost solar cells.1 Much effort was thereafter devoted to optimizing the performance of DSSCs and solar energy conversion efficiencies of ∼11% have been demonstrated.2 Apart from the design and synthesis of more efficient, stable and low-cost dyes, various TiO2 structures such as nanoparticles,3,4 mesoporous beads,5–9 nanorods and nanotubes10–14 have been applied to enhance the performance of TiO2 photoanodes. Considering that ruthenium-based dyes were attached to the oxide surface through monolayer adsorption, traditional nanocrystalline photoanodes with an enormous surface area have the intrinsic advantages of providing more active sites for dye loading. However, these nano-sized particles (10–30 nm) can hardly scatter incident light backwards. On the other hand, the sensitizers (typically, N3 and N719) have a low absorption efficiency in the red region, which may lead to poor light harvest efficiency in the wavelength range of 600–800 nm. Therefore, bilayer photoanodes have been proposed to introduce an additional scattering layer on the nanocrystalline film to reinforce the red light harvesting by means of light scattering effects.15–18 Large TiO2 particles have been commonly used as scattering layers. However, their low surface area has inevitably resulted in insufficient dye loading and a somewhat reduced energy conversion efficiency. Therefore, an ideal scattering material should fulfil the two foremost requirements of a high surface area for dye loading and a large particle size to enhance the harvest of red and near-infrared light.19 To this end, several examples using hollow microspheres with a high surface area as the scattering layer, such as nano-embossed hollow spherical TiO2 and double-shell TiO2 hollow spheres, have been previously reported.20,21 The diameters of these bi-functional hollow materials were comparable to the wavelength of the red and near-infrared light which could enhance the light harvesting of the photoanodes. Moreover, the multiple-reflection effect occurring inside the interior cavities could trap the incident light in the photoanode for a longer duration, which brought forth more opportunities for light absorption.22,23 In addition, these hollow spheres possessed a high surface area, which could alleviate the loss in dye loading amount compared with bulk scattering materials. Therefore, enhanced energy conversion efficiencies were demonstrated for these DSSCs with bilayer structured photoanodes employing TiO2 hollow spheres as scattering layers.
Hollow structured TiO2 materials with different building blocks and compositions were intelligently fabricated and exhibited improved performances compared to their solid counterparts.24–28 Although the straightforward template-engaged strategies have the merits of recovering the shape of the templates and realizing size tunable preparation, they suffer from many disadvantages such as high cost, tedious procedure and the collapse of the hollow structure when removing the templates.29–31 Therefore, it is necessary to develop a template-free method to overcome these pitfalls. In general, the template-free strategies for the preparation of TiO2 hollow spheres fall into two categories: Ostwald ripening and self-template transforms. The former start from solid aggregate spheres and the hollowing is driven by the different surface free energies of the primary particles, which could be described as the dissolving of the inner particles (with higher free energy) and the growing of the others (with lower free energy) distributed on the outer radius.32–34 On the other hand, the self-template method usually begins with the formation of an amorphous precursor. Afterwards, the surface of the amorphous template is firstly crystallized and the template with poor stability would be gradually removed. Therefore, the as-generated Ti species from the decomposition of the amorphous core leads to the continuous growth of the crystallized shell and the formation of a hollow structure.35–37 Although these methods have many advantages such as low-cost, high-efficiency and easy to scale up, to the best of our knowledge, only hollow spheres with irregular diameters could be obtained through these one-step processes. Therefore, it is still a challenge to develop a facile method for the preparation of hollow spheres with uniform and tunable diameters.
Herein, we developed a one-step hydrothermal method to directly convert commercial P25 powders into monodisperse TiO2 hierarchical hollow spheres. This unique structure is assembled from well-crystallized nanospindles with lengths ranging from 10 nm to 200 nm and the diameter of the hollow spheres could be tuned from 400 nm to 1000 nm by simply adjusting the ammonia content of the precursor solution. Moreover, nitrogen adsorption isotherm analysis demonstrated that the obtained TiO2 hierarchical hollow spheres have a high specific surface area. Furthermore, we used these hierarchical hollow microspheres as the scattering layer to balance the dye adsorption and scattering effect in DSSCs and an 8.10% solar energy conversion efficiency was demonstrated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of TiO2 hierarchical hollow spheres
0.32 g P25 (Degussa) was dispersed in a mixture solution of 70 mL hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30 wt%) and 20 mL ammonia (NH4OH, 26–28 wt%). After being stirred at room temperatures for 24 h, the suspension turned into a clear light yellow precursor solution. Then, 10 mL of this yellow precursor was extracted and transferred into a 50 mL Teflon container with additions of 10 mL distilled water and 20 mL absolute ethanol. The mixture was sealed tightly with a stainless jacket and heated at 160 °C for 24 h. The final residue was centrifuged and washed with water and ethanol, respectively. Finally, the as-prepared sample was dried at 60 °C for 2 h. In addition, the ammonia dosage in the precursor solution was adjusted, while keeping the total volume (90 mL) unchanged, to control the size of the final hollow products.
2.2. Preparation of 15–20 nm TiO2 nanocrystals
The preparation of 15–20 nm TiO2 nanocrystals was based on a previous report.38 Typically, 7.5 mL of titanium isopropoxide (Sigma) was added into 45 mL of 0.1 M HNO3 aqueous solution. The suspension was placed in an 80 °C water bath and stirred for 8 h. The concentrated suspension was then transferred into a 50 mL autoclave and heated at 230 °C for 12 h. The as-prepared TiO2 colloid particles were collected by centrifugation and stocked for later use without drying.
2.3. Materials characterizations
The morphologies and structures of the products were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI, S4800), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai F30), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.1542 nm, 40 kV, 100 mA) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, Micrometrics ASAP 2010). Moreover, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford, INCA MICSF+), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Bruker, VECTOR22), thermo-gravimetric and differential scanning calorimeter analyses (TG-DSC, thermal analysis, SDT Q600) were also performed. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were carried out on a laser light scattering spectrometer (ALV/DLS/SLS-5022F) equipped with an ALV-5000/EPP Multiple Tau Digital Correlator and a JDS Uniphase 1145P 22 mW He–Ne laser (632.8 nm wavelength).
2.4. Preparation of the photoanodes
To prepare the paste, hydroxypropyl cellulose (Aldrich) was added to diethylene glycol with a concentration of ∼10 wt%. The paste was added into the stock TiO2 colloids wet product (containing ∼15% net TiO2) in a proportion of ∼40% of TiO2 weight. The mixture was vigorously stirred for about 2 h to obtain the slurry for the semi-transparent adsorption layer. The paste was also added into the obtained hollow spheres (∼750 nm) product with a ratio of ∼40 wt% of TiO2. After stirring, the slurry for the scattering layer was prepared. The bilayer film was constructed by the doctor-blade method through two-step calcination. Nanocrystals were spread onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate (TEC-8, LOF) with adhesive tape to control the film thickness. After drying in air, the film was heated up to 450 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1 and maintained for 30 min. After calcination, another layer of hollow spheres or large TiO2 particles (300 nm, Beijing Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.) were deposited on the semi-transparent layer and annealed with the same heating profile. After cooling to 80 °C, the films were sensitized in a solution of cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate) ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium (N719, Solaronix SA, Switzerland) in ethanol (3 × 10−4 M) for 24 h. The dyed films were then sandwiched together with platinized FTO counter electrodes and the electrolyte was then injected into the cell from the edges by capillarity. The content of the electrolyte is 0.05 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine and 0.6 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII) in 3-methoxypropionitrile.
2.5. Photovoltage measurements
Photocurrent–voltage (I–V) measurements were performed on a Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system using simulated AM 1.5 sunlight with an output power of 100 mW cm−2 produced by a solar simulator (Newport 69911). The incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded on a Keithley 2000 sourcemeter under the irradiation of a 150 W tungsten lamp with 1/4 m monochromator (Spectral Product DK240). The optical diffuse-reflection spectra were measured by a spectrophotometer (HITACHI U-4100).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure and morphology

Fig. 1a displays the SEM image of the as-prepared sample, indicating a narrow size distribution with an average diameter of 750 ± 30 nm. The higher-magnification SEM image in Fig. 1b shows a hierarchical structure composed of nanospindles interlaced with each other and the size of these spindles ranges from 10 nm to 200 nm. Meanwhile, it can be found that the inner parts of these spherical products are completely hollowed (Fig. 1c and d). Furthermore, the HRTEM image of an individual nanospindle indicates a highly crystallized anatase phase structure. The inter-plane spacings of 0.48 nm and 0.35 nm imply that the spindle is growing along the 〈001〉 direction and enclosed with the {101} facets.

The XRD pattern of the hierarchical hollow spheres with a diameter of ∼750 nm is presented in Fig. 2a, in which all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to anatase TiO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1271). The nitrogen adsorption isotherm exhibits a type-IV isotherm with H1-type hysteresis at high relative pressures, which confirms the existence of large pores in this sample (Fig. 2b). A narrow pore size distribution (10–30 nm) with a peak size of about 18 nm is observed in the pore-size distribution curve (the inset of Fig. 2b). Moreover, the BET surface area of the sample is measured as ∼84.9 m2 g−1.

3.2. Growth mechanism and size control
Time-dependent experiments were carried out to shed light on the growth mechanism of this unique hollow structure. The precipitates collected at different time intervals were characterized by SEM and TEM, as shown in Fig. 3. After the peroxotitanium complex precursor was introduced into the hydrothermal system and maintained at 160 °C for 30 min, the as-obtained intermediate product consists of two types of spheres: microspheres with a diameter of about 500 nm and nanospheres of 30–50 nm (Fig. 3a and b). The XRD pattern demonstrates that these spheres are amorphous. Both EDS and TG-DSC analysis (Fig. S2a and S2b, ESI†) prove that organic ligands exist in this Ti containing intermediate product (Fig. S1, ESI†). In the corresponding FTIR spectra (Fig. S2c, ESI†), the peaks centered at 1640 and 1400 cm−1 can be ascribed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of carboxyl groups, revealing the coordination between the Ti and carboxyl groups. In the present reaction, the carboxyl groups are probably derived from the oxidation of ethanol molecules to acetates with the aid of hydrogen peroxides under hydrothermal conditions.39 Moreover, the large frequency separation (Δν = 240 cm−1) between the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations suggests that the acetate acts preferably as a monodentate rather than bidentate ligand for the Ti centers.40–42
 Fig. 3  SEM and TEM images of the intermediate products collected at different time intervals: (a–c) 30 min; (d–f) 4 h; (g–i) 8 h and (j–l) 16 h. 
When the reaction was prolonged to 4 h, as shown in Fig. 3d–f, the nanospheres disappeared. Meanwhile, nanospindles of about 50–150 nm in length were observed, distributed on the surface of the microspheres. Weak diffraction peaks belonging to anatase phase TiO2 could be identified in the corresponding XRD pattern (Fig. S1, ESI†), indicating that the newly formed spindles are anatase. When the reaction time was further increased to 8 h, these nanospindles grew both in length and diameter and the microspheres were covered with the interlaced spindles (Fig. 3g and h). However, as displayed in Fig. 3i, no obvious cavity was found at this stage. Until the reaction was carried out for 16 h, the solid microspheres were partially transformed to a hollow structure (Fig. 3j–l). When the reaction time finally reached 24 h, the titanium precursors in the microspheres were completely removed, and larger cavities were formed. TiO2 + H2O2 + OH− → [Ti(H2O2)n·(OH)4−n]n+(OH)n(1) C2H5OH + H2O2 + OH− → CH3COO− + H2O(2) [Ti(H2O2)n·(OH)4−n]n+(OH)n + CH3COO− → [Ti(H2O2)n·(OOCCH3)4−n]n+(OH)n + H2O(3)
Based on the above observations, a growth mechanism was tentatively proposed, as displayed in Scheme 1. At the initial stage, TiO2 powders were dissolved into the mixture of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia to produce a stable peroxotitanium complex [Ti(H2O2)n·(OH)4−n]n+(OH)n (eqn (1)).43–48 After mixing with an equal volume of alcohol, these peroxotitanium complex might further aggregate into nano-sized amorphous spheres (Fig. 3a–c), which can be proven by dynamic laser scattering with a peak centered at ∼40 nm (Fig. S3, ESI†). Under hydrothermal conditions, ethanol could be oxidized into acetate by the excessive hydrogen peroxide (eqn (2)). Moreover, because of the ambient alkalinity, the carboxyl groups with unpaired electrons had strong coordinating capacity and could substitute the hydroxyl ligands to form a new Ti complex ([Ti(H2O2)n·(OOCCH3)4−n]n+(OH)n) (eqn (3)). Subsequently, both hydrolytic and non-hydrolytic condensation processes occurred in the water–ethanol system and finally formed amorphous microspherical products.39,49 Under hydrothermal conditions, due to its higher surface free energy, hydrolysis reactions would occur preferably on the nanospheres to release Ti species for nucleation on the surface of the microspheres. Because the large amount of NH4+ in the reaction system could hinder the growth of lateral facets of the anatase structure,50 the anatase TiO2 particles selectively grew along the 〈001〉 direction to form spindle-like particles. As the reaction proceeded, the inner microspheres began to decompose and served as a reservoir of Ti species for the later growth of the nanospindles. Finally, the amorphous microspheres were completely removed and shaped the cavities of the hierarchical hollow spheres. Due to the nuclei forming at different stages, the as-obtained nanospindles had a wide size-distribution. During the growing process, the growth of well-crystallized nanospindles occurred at the expense of amorphous micro/nanospheres, which was driven by the minimization of the system free energy.

Interestingly, we found that the diameters of the hollow microspheres were strongly dependent on the ammonia concentration of the precursor solution. When the ammonia dosages were increased from 5 mL to 10 mL and 25 mL, as shown in Fig. 4, the average diameters of the hollow spheres could be tuned from 500 ± 25 nm to 650 ± 30 nm and 930 ± 45 nm, respectively. It is reasonable that with increasing ammonia dosage, the pH value of the reaction solution would increase accordingly, which results in a rapid polycondensation process of the [Ti(H2O2)n·(OOCCH3)4−n]n+(OH)n complex and large sized microspheres.

3.3. Photovoltaic performance
In order to investigate the scattering effect of the hierarchical hollow spheres on the photovoltaic performances, we compared four cells with different film structures. Semi-transparent films composed of a single layer of TiO2 nanocrystals with a thickness of ∼8 μm and ∼13 μm were labeled as Film-1 and Film-2, respectively. The commercial TiO2 large particles (∼300 nm in diameter) and the as-prepared hollow spheres with an average diameter of ∼750 nm were respectively deposited as the scattering layer (∼5 μm) on the TiO2 nanocrystalline film (∼8 μm) to fabricate the bilayer films which were labeled as Film-3 and Film-4. The structure of Film-4 is shown in the inset of Fig. 5. Moreover, the corresponding DSSCs assembled from these photoanodes were respectively denoted as Cell-1, Cell-2, Cell-3 and Cell-4. The cross-section view of Film-4 is displayed in Fig. S4a (ESI†), which indicates that the hierarchical hollow spheres are homogeneously deposited on the nanocrystalline layer. Fig. S4b and S4c (ESI†) depict that the hollow spheres are well-preserved after rigorous stirring and calcination, and the nanocrystalline film is assembled from nanocrystals of 15–20 nm in diameter.

I–V curves of the DSSCs based on different photoanodes measured under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). The inset displays the structure of Film-4. 
The photocurrent–photovoltage (I–V) characteristics of the DSSCs based on the four photoanodes are shown in Fig. 5 and the corresponding photovoltaic characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Since the filling factor (FF) and open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) varied little among the four cells, the variation of the energy conversion efficiency (η) mainly came from the change in the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc). Compared with Cell-1, Cell-2 had an enhanced conversion efficiency of 7.29%, which was attributed to the increased dye loading capacity of the thicker film (3.20 × 10−7 mol cm−2). When commercial TiO2 large particles were deposited to form a scattering layer, the Jsc of Cell-3 was further increased to 16.90 mA cm−2 and the η of Cell-3 was improved to 7.82%. Considering the small change in the dye loading amount of Film-3 (2.50 × 10−7 mol cm−2), the main function of this large particle layer was not to produce photocurrent itself but to scatter the incident light backwards.20 For Cell-4, apart for the scattering effect, the hierarchical hollow spheres could provide a high surface area for a greater dye loading amount (2.87 × 10−7 mol cm−2). Moreover, these well-crystallized nanospindles with a high aspect ratio may also improve the transport of photoelectrons because of the diminished grain boundaries, which finally helped to improve the collection efficiency of the DSSC.51 Therefore, the photocurrent of Cell-4 was greatly improved to 17.49 mA cm−2 and a high conversion efficiency of 8.10% was obtained.

Fig. 6 presents the UV-Vis reflection spectra of the single-layer films composed of hollow spheres with diameters of 500, 750, and 930 nm before and after dye loading. For the purpose of comparison, films composed of 15–20 nm nanocrystallites and commercial TiO2 particles (∼300 nm in diameter) were also prepared. It can be seen that before loading with N719 dyes, all the hollow sphere films possessed a strong scattering effect in the wavelength region of 400–1400 nm (Fig. 6a). Furthermore, characteristic photonic reflection peaks were observed in the hollow sphere films by subtracting the reflection background (the inset of Fig. 6a), indicating a red shift of the peak with an increase in the size of the hollow spheres. Moreover, additional weak reflectance peaks were also observed for the hollow sphere films with sizes of 500 and 930 nm, which are in good agreement with the size dependent behavior of the light scattering.52 After loading with N719, drastic reflectance decreases were observed for the films made of hollow spheres, indicating that they had better dye adsorption capacity than the commercial large particles (Fig. 6b).

The inset in (a) gives the characteristic photonic reflection peaks after subtracting the reflection background. (The film thicknesses are all controlled at ∼13 μm.) 

Fig. 7 shows the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra as a function of wavelength for the four cells. Owing to the improved scattering effect, Cell-3 and Cell-4 had higher IPCE values in the long wavelength region ranging from 500 nm to 750 nm compared with the nanocrystalline cells. In addition to the scattering effect, the interior cavities of the submicron-sized hierarchical spheres could function as trapping chambers to confine the incident light and reinforce the light harvesting by means of multiple-reflection.21,22 Moreover, the hierarchical hollow spheres could also provide a high surface area for dye anchoring; therefore, the absolute IPCE of Cell-4 was higher than the other cells in the entire wavelength region, which was in good agreement with the corresponding high Jsc. Although Cell-2 and Cell-3 had similar IPCE peak values, the IPCE of Cell-2 was higher at 400–550 nm but lower at 550–750 nm than that of Cell-3, suggesting the Jsc increment of Cell-2 was attributed to the increased dye loading amount. In contrast, the Jsc increment of Cell-3 mainly derived from the improved scattering effect of the TiO2 large particles. Because of the lower dye loading amount and high transparency, Cell-1 exhibited the lowest IPCE value in the whole wavelength range.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have prepared monodisperse TiO2 hierarchical hollow spheres assembled from nanospindles and the growth mechanism was intensively studied. The bilayer structured DSSC employing the hollow spheres as the scattering layer demonstrated a high conversion efficiency of 8.10%, in contrast to 7.82% and 7.29% respectively for the cells employing commercial TiO2 large particles as the scattering layer and using single layer nanocrystalline film. The efficiency enhancement was mainly attributed to the increment of photocurrent density from 16.14, 16.90 to 17.49 mA cm−2. Moreover, based on the UV-Vis reflectance and IPCE analyses, the Jsc increment derived from the synergistic effect of the hierarchical hollow spheres, because they could balance the dye loading capacity and the scattering effect of the photoanode. Considering the fact that the diameter of the hollow products could be tailored by simply altering the ammonia dosage in the precursor solution, we believe this material could find further applications in high efficiency energy conversion devices.
