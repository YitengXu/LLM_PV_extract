    , Accepted 9th May 2014First published on 12th May 2014AbstractNanostructured ZnO films are promising photoanode materials in photoelectrochemical water splitting. While such ZnO photoanodes have achieved high activity and good light conversion efficiency in the UV spectral region, their application in water splitting devices has been hampered by the susceptibility of ZnO towards photocorrosion in aqueous electrolytes. We report a systematic investigation aimed at optimising the electrolyte solution to improve the long-term stability of ZnO photoanodes. A stability diagram, based on the band edge positions of ZnO and the pH-dependent photodegradation potentials of ZnO (relative to the decomposition of water), indicates that the optimum pH operating conditions for ZnO photoanodes lie between pH 9–12.5. To verify this prediction experimentally, the activity and long-term stability of uniform screen-printed nano-ZnO films was tested in a wide range of buffered and non-buffered electrolytes (pH 6–13.5). The ZnO films were more active in buffered, than in non-buffered electrolytes, and the highest activities were observed close to the pKa of the phosphate and borate buffers used. Under zero applied potential, these screen-printed films achieved the highest reported photocurrents to date (0.42 mA cm−2 at pH 6 and 0.67 mA cm−2 at pH 10.5) for any pristine or modified ZnO-based water oxidation catalyst. The films were subjected to 12 h of controlled potential electrolysis, in selected electrolytes, under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight. The results are in good agreement with calculations based on thermodynamic data for ZnO. Films tested at pH 6 and 7 (representing typically used operating conditions) degraded rapidly, whereas they exhibited the highest stability when tested in a pH 10.5 borate buffer. In this case, 75% of the initial photoactivity was preserved after 12 hours, indicating that the lifetime of the electrode could be increased by over an order of magnitude compared to standard testing conditions.
Introduction
Photocatalytic water splitting over semiconductor electrodes has been the subject of intense research since the 1972 discovery of the Honda–Fujishima effect on titanium dioxide surfaces.1 In the past four decades, a wide range of semiconductors have been evaluated for their potential as efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen production by direct solar water splitting vide infra.2–11
In general, if sufficient photovoltage is generated at the interface of an n-type semiconductor and the aqueous electrolyte, photo-oxidation of water by minority carriers (holes) can occur at the anode. Similarly, photo-reduction of water can be achieved by electrons generated at a p-type semiconductor photocathode.12 For these reactions to proceed, the band alignment of the semiconductor electrodes is crucial. Photo-oxidation at the anode becomes possible if the upper edge of the valence band of an n-type semiconductor lies at a potential more positive than that required for water oxidation. Analogously, photo-reduction proceeds when the lower edge of the conduction band of a p-type cathode is more negative than the potential required for hydrogen evolution by water reduction.13
Examples of materials studied as potential photocathodes include p-GaP,14 p-InP,15 p-GaInP2,16 p-Si,11a CdTe,10,17 p-WS2 (ref. 18) and Cu2O.19 Semiconductors, such as TiO2,1 WO3,2 GaN,20 SnO2,21 Fe2O3,3 SrTiO3,5 BaTiO3,5 ZnO22 or ZnS23 are promising photoanode candidates because they absorb high energy photons and are, therefore, capable of generating enough photovoltage (a minimum of 1.23 V) to drive unassisted water oxidation or both water oxidation and reduction (e.g., TiO2, TaON).24 The disadvantage of wide-bandgap semiconductors is that their light absorption is mostly limited to the UV region of the solar spectrum.11a Recently, advances have been made towards extending the absorption of these materials into the UV, either by incorporating dopants to narrow the bandgap25 or by the addition of hydrophobic dyes onto the electrode surface.11b
Apart from the fundamental limitation of light absorption, photocorrosion of semiconductor electrode materials in aqueous electrolytes is a major issue that has hampered their practical use.24 At the illuminated surface of an n-type semiconductor anode surface, two main competing reactions take place; the decomposition of water by the photogenerated holes and, less desirably, the corrosion of the electrode itself due to destabilization caused by hole trapping on the semiconductor surface.13,26 Based on thermodynamic and kinetic criteria, the possibilities of avoiding photodecomposition of the anode material can be determined. Gerischer and co-workers published a series of studies discussing these criteria, focusing partly on ZnO (amongst other materials, such as TiO2 or CdS).13,26,27
ZnO has attracted much attention in the past decades as a favourable photoanode material towards achieving efficient photoelectrochemical water oxidation, due to its good electron mobility, excellent optical properties, wide availability and relatively low toxicity.22b,28 More recently, nanostructuring of ZnO films has been shown to improve photocurrent yields due to their large surface area relative to their illuminated geometric area, decreased reflectivity and improved charge transfer to the conducting electrode substrate.22a ZnO nanorods, nanosheets, nanowires and various nanoparticles have been synthesised in order to increase the efficiency of water oxidation.22,25,28a,29
Many recently developed ZnO-based photo-electrocatalysts for water oxidation exhibit improved light absorption properties with high photocurrent densities. Relatively little data is available, however, on the photostability and long-term performance of these electrodes. Yang et al. reported that the activity of N-doped ZnO nanorods, prepared by a hydrothermal method, when tested in a 0.5 M NaClO4 electrolyte (pH 7),22b dropped by ∼25% within the first 20 minutes, but then increased up to 90% of the original level after 90 minutes. The authors suggested that the chemical instability of ZnO could be reduced by covering the ZnO nanowire core with, for example, a thin TiO2 shell. Liu et al.29e tested this approach by coating ZnO nanowire arrays with a thin, passivating TiO2 layer. Testing in highly alkaline electrolytes revealed a 10% drop in photoactivity for the uncoated ZnO NRAs after 1 hour, whereas the activity of the passivated ZnO NRAs remained unchanged within the same timeframe. According to the authors, this was the first report to use ZnO-based water oxidation catalysts in highly alkaline electrolytes. Indeed, most studies on ZnO photoelectrocatalysts focus on their operation in close to neutral media.
Qiu et al. tested undoped and N-doped ZnO nano-tetrapods in a pH 7.0 Na2SO4 electrolyte solution,29a and found that the initial activity of the N-doped films was higher compared to the undoped films. When operated continuously over one hour, however, the activity of the undoped nanorods remained close to 100%, while the N-doped nanorods retained 90% of their activity within the same timeframe. Hassan et al. claimed ‘exceptional stability’ for (undoped) ZnO nano-tetrapods prepared by a thermal evaporation method when tested in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution.29b Inspection of their controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) data, collected over a 20 minute period, confirms that the less active catalyst film indeed retains close to 100% activity, while the performance of the more active sample drops by approximately 20% over the same testing period. This result, in fact, seems to correspond well with the data reported by Yang et al.22b for studies at pH 7.
While the optimum pH and electrolyte composition for maximum oxygen evolution has been extensively studied for “dark” electrocatalysts,30 these conditions have not been well established for semiconductor photocatalysts. Phosphate and borate buffers have been shown to enhance the rate of oxygen evolution when used with various water oxidation catalysts, for example, manganese, cobalt or nickel oxides, mainly by improving proton conduction between the anode and cathode.31 By preventing the accumulation of protons near the anode surface (which could destabilise the electrode material), these buffers significantly increase the lifetime of the catalysts.
Mohamad and co-workers studied the pH conditions for the sol–gel synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles, concluding those synthesized in the pH 8 to 11 region possessed optimal optical properties.32
In this study, thermodynamic considerations are used in an attempt to optimise the operating conditions for water splitting cells employing ZnO-based photoanodes. The pH range where the ZnO anode is theoretically stable against photodecomposition was first predicted with the help of an E-pH stability diagram comparing decomposition potentials for the aqueous electrolyte and the ZnO electrodes. To test the prediction experimentally, reproducible ZnO nanoparticle films were screen-printed and their photocatalytic performance was tested in a range of electrolyte solutions. The effects of the phosphate and borate buffers on photocurrent generation and on the long-term stability of ZnO under operational conditions are discussed. A particularly promising result was the observation of photocurrent even in the absence of an applied bias in an optimised, buffered electrolyte.
Background

Stability of ZnO photo-electrocatalysts: thermodynamic considerations. 
The principles of the photodegradation of semiconductor electrodes in aqueous media had been established as early as the 1970's. For example, a series of studies by Gerischer and co-workers describe the thermodynamic criteria that need to be met to protect electrodes from photocorrosion during operation in water splitting cells.13,26,33
Briefly, a semiconductor is protected against photodecomposition by electrons if its cathodic photodecomposition potential (EDCe−) lies negative to the conduction band and against photodecomposition by holes if its anodic photodecomposition potential (EDCh+) lies positive to the valence band edge. This “ideal” situation is shown in Fig. 1A. Zinc oxide is stable against photodecomposition by electrons but is intrinsically unstable to photodecomposition by holes, as shown in Fig. 1B.
 Fig. 1  (A) Band diagram for an ideally stable n-type semiconductor at pH = 0. (B) Band diagram of ZnO at pH = 0. EFB, marked with *, was calculated based on measurements presented in this study. 
Decomposition can be avoided, however, when water is oxidised at a potential negative to EDCh+. Towards this end, the relative positions of the potentials corresponding to the competing reactions need to be determined over the accessible pH range. The Nernstian shift (−59 mV/pH) in the redox potential of the 1/2 O2/H2O couple with increasing solution pH is well known.34 The anodic photodecomposition potential of semiconducting oxides is generally independent of pH, but this does not hold true for zinc oxide.24 The decomposition potential is determined by the dissolved products formed when the electrode photocorrodes.35 A constant decomposition potential over the entire pH range would only be possible if the same product formed at any given solution pH. The Pourbaix-diagram of zinc oxide, however, indicates that at acidic to neutral pH, the predominant dissolved zinc species is Zn2+, at highly alkaline pH ZnO22−, and HZnO2− between pH 9.2–13.2.36 Accordingly, the equations describing the electrode decomposition are: ZnO + 2p+ = Zn2+ + 1/2O2(1) ZnO + 3OH− + 2p+ = HZnO2− + 1/2O2 + H2O(2) ZnO + 4OH− + 2p+ = ZnO22− + 1/2O2 + 2H2O(3)
The solubility of ZnO is the lowest at pH 9.3 (10−7–10−8 M), and increases exponentially both towards more acidic and alkaline pH values.35 (Naturally, soluble species can co-exist in same solution, their relative concentrations determined by equilibria, as indicated in the Pourbaix diagram.)
The decomposition potential EDCh+ for each reaction can be calculated from the change in the Gibbs free energy upon the breakdown of the electrode material: ΔG = −RT lnK(4) ΔG = −nFEDCh+(5) (6)where K is the equilibrium constant for reactions (1)–(3), R is the ideal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, n is the number of electrons involved in eqn (1)–(3) and F is the Faraday constant. According to Zhang, the decomposition potentials under acidic (1) and highly alkaline (3) conditions are at 0.89 V and 0.43 V vs. SHE, respectively.35 The EDCh+ corresponding to (2) was calculated in this study as 1.08 V vs. SHE. Based on these calculations and experimental EIS data, a proposed stability diagram across the pH spectrum was constructed.

Experimental
Screen printing of the ZnO films
Screen printing, a well-established method for the preparation of highly uniform TiO2 nanoparticle films in DSC fabrication,37 was adapted to deposit commercial zinc oxide nano-powders. The ZnO nanoparticles (Sigma Aldrich, d < 200 nm) were printed onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass slides (10 Ω per square, DyeSol) using a modified screen-printing method adapted from a published procedure.30a In a typical preparation, ZnO nanoparticle powder (1.0 g) was mixed with 5.0 ml ethylcellulose binder solution (10 wt% in ethyl alcohol, Sigma Aldrich 433837) and 4.0 ml terpineol. The paste was screen-printed onto FTO glass substrates in 1, 2 and 3 layers (resulting in a thickness of 0.6 μm, 1.7 μm and 2.4 μm, respectively). The films were sintered in air on a hotplate according to a heating program developed for TiO2 and indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) films in dye sensitized solar cell (DSC) fabrication.38
The photocatalytic activity of the ZnO films was tested by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in a 0.6 M Na2SO4 solution (pH 6). Based on this initial study, the 2-layer films were chosen for subsequent characterization and photocatalytic testing.
Phosphate (0.6 M, pH 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8.5 and 12) and borate (0.6 M, pH 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5 and 11) pH buffer solutions as well as Na2SO4 and NaClO4 solutions (0.6 M) were made freshly with Millipore quality water just prior to electrochemical testing.
Film characterisation and testing of photocatalytic activity
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was performed with a JEOL JSM-7001F FEGSEM instrument fitted with a Bruker 10 mm2 Si drift detector analysis system, operated at 30 kV. The films on the FTO glass substrate were previously sputter-coated with platinum (1 nm). SEM characterisation was carried out the Monash Centre for Electron Microscopy (MCEM).
X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Philips instrument with powder XRD capability. The printed films were gently scraped off the supporting glass slides and sprinkled onto a quartz plate thinly coated with Vaseline. XRD scans were taken using Cu Kα radiation, with a 1° divergence slit, 0.2° receiving slit and carbon monochromators at a 0.5° min−1 scan rate (2Φ range 25°–80°).
Testing of catalytic activity of the electrodeposited ZnO films was performed using a Bio-Logic VSP Modular 5-channel potentiostat, at room temperature (20 °C), in a Zahner-Elektrik PECC-1 electrochemical cell. The flat quartz window of the electrochemical cell helped to ensure well reproducible conditions during photoelectrochemical performance testing. Photocurrent generation was systematically tested in electrolytes with pH ranging from 6 to 13.5, with particular focus on the pH 7.0–10.5 region. Illumination was provided by an Oriel 150 W solar simulator equipped with an ozone-free Xe lamp and an AM1.5G filter to match the solar spectrum. A fresh film was used for each measurement. The electrolytes used were: 0.6 M Na2SO4, 0.6 M phosphate buffers (at pH 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 12), 0.6 M borate buffers (at pH 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, 10, 10.5 and 11), a 0.6 M NaClO4 solution adjusted to pH 12 with NaOH and a 0.6 M NaOH solution (pH 13.5).
Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) testing was carried out at a 5 mV s−1 scan rate, −0.2 to 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl, in the positive or oxidative direction, under chopped illumination (5 s on, 5 s off) at 1 Sun light intensity (100 mW cm−2). The overpotential for O2 evolution was calculated as the difference between the applied potential (Eapp) vs. Ag/AgCl and the E0 of oxygen evolution at the appropriate pH (vs. Ag/AgCl), based on the Nernst equation, referenced against Ag/AgCl: η(V) = Eapp(V) − E0(V) = Eapp(V) − (1.23 V − 0.2V − 0.059 pH).
Incident Photon to Charge Carrier Conversion Efficiency (IPCE) was measured at pH 10.5 (in a borate buffer) following a previously described procedure,39 using a 150 W Oriel solar simulator (with a horizontal lightbeam) equipped with an AM1.5G filter and bandpass filters.
The dependence of photocurrent on light intensity was measured by recording linear sweep voltammograms of each film between −0.5–1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl, at a 5 mV s−1 scan rate. The light intensity was adjusted to 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 Suns using neutral density filters.
Long-term performance was tested by Controlled Potential Electrolysis (CPE), at 120 mV overpotential corresponding to 670 mV, 620 mV, 490 mV, 410 mV, 320 mV and 230 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, at pH 6.0 (0.6 M Na2SO4), 7.0 (phosphate buffer), 9.0 (borate buffer), 10.5 (borate buffer), 12.0 (phosphate buffer and 0.6 M NaClO4/NaOH) and 13.5 (0.6 M NaOH), respectively; under 1 Sun illumination over 12 hours. Additionally, CPE was carried out at −0.2 V, 0 V and 0.66 V (η = 250 mV) vs. Ag/AgCl under 1 Sun illumination in a pH 10.5 borate buffer for 12 hours.
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy measurements (Mott–Schottky plots) were recorded using a Bio-Logic VSP Modular 5-channel potentiostat operated in Staircase Potentio-Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (SPEIS) mode. Mott–Schottky plots were recorded −1 V to +1 V vs. Ag/AgCl, using a RC equivalent circuit fitting model.
Inductively Coupled Plasma-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-TOF-MS) analysis was carried out using a GBC Optimass 9500 instrument. Raw count rates from the analyses were externally standardised by means of a calibration curve constructed using Zn2+ stock solutions (containing Zn2+ ions in 0, 10, 25, 50 and 100 ppb concentrations). Indium was used as an internal standard. The pristine and post-12 hour operation ZnO films (of 0.49 cm2 surface area each) were dissolved in 10 ml 70% nitric acid and diluted to 50 ml stock solutions prior to the ICP-MS analysis. Electrolyte solutions after 12 hours of film operation were also analysed.
Results and discussion
Flatband potential and stability diagram
In aqueous electrolytes, the flatband potential, which is defined by the relative positions of the band edges, is strongly influenced by the solution pH. At each pH, the flatband potential can be experimentally determined using the Mott–Schottky relationship: (10)where e is the electron charge, ε is the dielectric constant of ZnO, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, ND is the donor density, E is the applied potential at the electrode, EFB is the flatband potential of the ZnO electrode and k is the Boltzmann constant.
Gerischer et al. found that, due to the formation of an additional electric double layer by the interaction of the ZnO surface with H+ and OH− ions present in the solution, the pH dependence of the flatband potential over a large pH range follows a Nerstian behaviour, i.e., a shift of −59 mV/pH.33 Therefore, the relative positions of the band edges and the water oxidation and reduction potentials remain unchanged over a large part of the pH scale. The −59 mV/pH shift was confirmed experimentally within the examined pH 6–10.5 range (marked by crosses in Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  Stability diagram of ZnO. Black crosses mark the EFB values calculated based on Mott–Schottky measurements. Vertical dashed lines represent the equilibrium pH between the three main dissolved Zn-species. The light blue line shows the thermodynamic O2 evolution potential, while the light red line represents the anodic photodecomposition potential of ZnO by photogenerated holes (EDCH+). The photoanode is stable in the pH region where EDCH+ is more positive than the O2 evolution potential, approximately between pH 9–12.5. The dark blue line shows the thermodynamic hydrogen evolution potential, which lies positive to the cathodic decomposition potential (EDCe−, marked with the dark red line) of ZnO across the entire pH range. 
Anodic and cathodic decomposition potentials were taken from Zhang.35 Where data was not available, the potentials were calculated based on the change in Gibbs free energy upon formation of the photodecomposition products and equilibria between the dissolved species (defined by the Pourbaix diagram.) ZnOH+, which forms in a small amount around pH 9, was not included in this calculation. The proposed ZnO stability diagram is shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2 suggests that long-term operation of a ZnO-based water oxidation catalyst without extensive photodegradation should be possible in the pH 9–12.5 range. At pH 6 and 7, dissolution of the film is expected even if water oxidation reaction occurs without applied overpotential (i.e., at the thermodynamic limit). If an overpotential is required, the blue line indicating oxygen evolution from water shifts to more positive potentials, which narrows the window for optimum operation even further.
These considerations are valid when no other species are present in the electrolyte that could either form a precipitate with ZnO or complex with the dissolved zinc species. When operating in buffered electrolytes, such possibilities need to be considered.
Based on these theoretical considerations a working hypothesis was developed and tested in practice by examining the pH-dependent activity and long-term stability of ZnO films during photo-electrochemical water oxidation.
Film deposition and characterization
The crystal phase of the ZnO films was confirmed to be the commonly occurring wurtzite phase by powder-XRD diffraction (see Fig. S1†). SEM studies showed that the porous catalyst films are composed of small spherical (40–50 nm) and larger, “brick-like” particles, approximately 50 × 100–200 nm in size (see below). The uniformity of the two-layered films was tested by ICP-MS analysis (as described in the Experimental section). The films were found to contain the same amount of Zn (31 μg) within a ±2% error (based on analysis of three fresh films).
Testing of the activity of the ZnO films by LSV in a 0.6 M Na2SO4 solution revealed that the photocurrent was very similar for the 1- and 2-layered films, (see Fig. S2†) which decreased slightly on addition of a third layer. Based on these results, the more robust two-layer films were used in further studies. A dark current above 1.2 V applied bias (vs. Ag/AgCl) was observed in each case, which could be due to the degradation of ZnO, as predicted by the stability diagram, as well as water oxidation.
Testing of photocatalytic activity as a function of pH
LSV scans recorded at pH 7.0 (phosphate buffer), pH 9.0 (borate buffer) and pH 13.5 (0.6 M NaOH) are shown in Fig. 3. The onset of dark current was found at 1.0 V, 1.1 V and 0.7 V, (vs. Ag/AgCl), at pH 7.0, 10.5, and 13.5, respectively. These values correspond to the upper stability limit of ZnO, and could be arising in part from film degradation.
 Fig. 3  LSV testing of the screen-printed ZnO photoanodes under 1 Sun chopped illumination, at pH 7 (blue line), pH 10.5 (red line) and 13.5 (black line). Dashed vertical lines represent the thermodynamic O2 evolution potential at the corresponding pH. The inset shows photocurrents at 0 mV overpotential at each pH, measured in various buffered and non-buffered electrolytes. 
Under illumination, significant photocurrents were observed even at −0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which equals 0 V applied potential vs. SHE (zero bias condition). At pH 7, the photocurrent increased with the applied bias up to 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, where it reached a plateau of 0.75 mA cm−2. At pH 10.5 and 13.5, the photocurrent showed little change throughout the measured voltage range and maximised at 0.70 and 0.55 mA cm−2, respectively. These relatively high photocurrents at close to 0 V applied potential set the screen-printed ZnO apart from other recently reported high-performing nano-ZnO -based water oxidation catalysts, where the photocurrent was typically found to be highly dependent on the applied bias.22,29f,g
The photocurrent density for the screen-printed ZnO photoanodes scales almost linearly with illumination power (up to 2 Suns, with near-saturation at 3 Suns) at low applied potentials. At the higher applied potentials (>1.2 V), the dark (degradation) current contributes to the measured current, and the difference between the currents recorded with and without illumination diminishes (Fig. S3†). The incident photon-to electron conversion (IPCE, shown in Fig. S4†) was found to be relatively high at 370 nm (41%) and 390 nm (10%), but effectively zero beyond 410 nm, as typically found for ZnO photoanodes.22b,29g
The dependence of photocurrent generation on pH is shown in the inset of Fig. 2. For the non-buffered Na2SO4 electrolyte at pH 6.0, the photocurrent (0.28 mA cm−2) was much lower than that measured for the buffered electrolytes (0.70 mA cm−2 was measured at pH 6.5 in a phosphate buffer). In the phosphate and borate buffers, the photocurrents fluctuate with local maxima close to their pKa. The highest photocurrent (0.82 mA cm−2) was measured at pH 7.5 in a phosphate buffer (pKa2 = 7.2) and at pH 9.5 in a borate buffer (pKa2 = 9.2), where buffering was the most effective. The variation in photocurrent within the buffering range was relatively small, although the photocurrent dropped quite significantly at pH 11, where the boric acid/sodium borate buffer is less effective. Higher current was measured again at pH 12 in a phosphate buffer, within the Na2HPO4/Na3PO4 buffering range (pKa3 = 12.7). When an unbuffered NaClO4/NaOH electrolyte was used at the same pH, the current dropped slightly from 0.69 to 0.56 mA cm−2. A similar photocurrent was measured at pH 13.5, in a 0.6 M NaOH solution. Thus, little variation in photocurrent with pH was observed when the electrolyte provided sufficient buffering capacity. More pronounced differences in the catalytic performance of the ZnO films with pH were observed when the cells were subjected to long-term constant potential electrolysis (CPE).
Long-term stability

Fig. 4 shows that in the pH 6.0 electrolyte, the activity, initially quite high (0.78 mA cm−2) decreased to 0 mA cm−2 within just 90 minutes. Even in the buffered pH 7.0 electrolyte, complete degradation was observed after 2 hours. At pH 9, stability was much improved, 58% of the initial photocurrent was still preserved after 12 h. An even better stability was observed at pH 10.5, where approximately 75% of the photocurrent was retained after 12 h. At pH 12, stability was decreased; the current dropped to 50% after 4 hours and was almost completely deactivated by the end of the 12 hour electrolysis. At 13.5, the photocurrent dropped by 50% in less than 90 minutes and then stabilised at close to 25% of the initial photocurrent.
 Fig. 4  Long-term stability over 12 h, under 1 Sun light intensity, (η = 120 mV) of the ZnO screen-printed films at various pH. (pH 6:0.6 M Na2SO4; pH 7 and 12:0.6 M phosphate buffers; pH 9 and 10.5:0.6 M borate buffers; pH 13.5:0.6 M NaOH). 
SEM images taken of the catalyst films before and after CPE testing, are shown in Fig. 5. The film tested at pH 6.0 was completely dissolved off the FTO glass substrate. At pH 7.0, the film had also almost completely dissolved, and the FTO crystals can be seen underneath the remains of the film in Fig. 5B. According to Awad and Kamel,40 phosphate ions (especially when present as a mixture of Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4), can result in the formation of complex phosphates on the surface. A highly polymerised, semi-glassy interface has been proposed to be formed via a dissolution–precipitation process:41 Zn2+ + 2H2PO4− ↔ Zn(H2PO4)2(7) 3Zn(H2PO4)2 ↔ Zn3(PO4)2·4H2O + 4H3PO4(8)
 Fig. 5  SEM images of (A) a fresh screen-printed ZnO film, (B–F) after 1 h CPE testing under 1 Sun illumination. (B) pH 7 (phosphate buffer); (C) pH 9 (borate buffer); (D) pH 10.5 (borate buffer); (E) pH 12 (phosphate buffer); (F) pH 13.5 (0.5 M NaOH). 
The resulting interface is likely to adversely affect the catalytic activity of the ZnO film and possibly accelerate the breakdown of the film. The breakdown of the passive film was postulated to involve diffusion of Zn2+ ions through the passive layer. The formation of H2PO4− near the film surface could also promote the dissolution process.
At pH 9.0, the nanoparticles are preserved, but are covered with very small particles, possibly indicating deposition of a borate species on the catalyst surface (Fig. 5C). The solubility zinc species is the lowest at pH 9.3 (between 10−7 and 10−8 M), and, incidentally, the solubility of borates (mostly in the form of H4BO7− and B4O72−) is also the lowest between pH 7–9.5 (ca. 10−2 to 10−3 M).36 Insoluble zinc borate species could passivate the ZnO surface, significantly decreasing the surface area available for contact between the catalyst and the electrolyte, leading to loss of activity. At pH 10.5, there is less degradation and no borate deposition was observed, correlating well with the good stability of photocurrent over 12 h (Fig. 5D).
At pH 12, the loss in activity was accompanied by extensive degradation of the ZnO film, accelerated by the presence of PO43− ions (see Fig. 5E). The breakdown and coverage of the catalysts with a zinc-phosphate passive layer is evidenced by the formation of nodules with high phosphorous content on the surface.42 The long-term behaviour of the ZnO catalyst film was also tested in a 0.6 M NaClO4/NaOH solution at pH 12 to examine film degradation in the absence of phosphate ions. In this case, the photocurrent was somewhat more stable (20% retained after 12 h), and the particles showed less degradation than in the phosphate buffer (shown in Fig. S5†).
At pH 13.5, the formation of larger, spherical grains was observed (Fig. 5F). Aurian-Blajeni and Tomkiewicz proposed that these passive films are composite layers of the electrolyte and the oxide film,43 often found to retain properties typical of an amorphous semiconductor film.44 The passivation processes at highly alkaline pH were summarised by Dirkse.45 The Zn(OH)2 film on the surface of ZnO film dissolves as Zn(OH)3− or Zn(OH)42− and, once the electrolyte layer covering the electrode becomes supersaturated, re-deposits again as amorphous Zn(OH)2. XRD analysis after the 12 hour CPE at pH 13.5 confirmed that the crystalline wurtzite phase had become more disordered and much less crystalline (see Fig. S1†). The less crystalline material was found to generate a stable photocurrent over the next 10 hours of CPE, but it was less active than the crystalline phase. The formation of larger particles also reduces the surface area and decreases the number of active surface sites, and most likely contributes to the lower activity observed after 2 hours.
Long-term stability was also investigated as a function of applied potential at pH 10.5. As shown in Fig. 6, the photocurrent versus time profile followed the same pattern over 12 hours of testing at −0.2, 0 and 0.66 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The current density increased when a small bias was applied (0 V vs. Ag/AgCl = 0.2 V vs. SHE), but did not increase further at higher potentials. The loss of activity was the same (%) in all three experiments.

The good stability of the ZnO films at pH 10.5 was also confirmed by ICP-MS analysis of the electrolyte and the used films. The amount of zinc that leached into solution was <15% of the total Zn-content of the corresponding films (see Table S1†).
The experimental data correlate well with the proposed stability diagram: the most stable operating conditions were in the pH 9–12.5 region, with a maximum stability at pH 10.5. Below pH 9 and at pH 13.5 rapid degradation of the films was observed. The screen-printed ZnO films also compare favourably with data available on the activity of recently reported water oxidising ZnO nanostructures, especially under zero bias conditions (see Table 1). Stability data, where available, is also presented.

The comparison of photocatalytic activity at 0 V applied potential (vs. SHE) shows that the screen-printed ZnO films reached the highest activity when an energy input was provided only by illumination (at 1 Sun light intensity). Stability data (for maximum of 90 minutes) was available for only a few of the presented ZnO-based catalysts. The screen-printed ZnO films decayed to 26% of their initial activity after 1 hour when a non-buffered Na2SO4 electrolyte was used at pH 6. The ∼100% stability of the screen-printed films at pH 10.5 over 1 hour was only matched by TiO2-coated ZnO nanorods reported by Liu et al.29e at pH 13.
Conclusions
The pH and potential dependence of photocatalytic activity and long-term stability of screen-printed ZnO photoanodes was investigated. The films exhibited high activity in water oxidation, even when little or no external potential was applied to the photo-electrochemical cell. The activity of the films effectively doubled when the electrolyte solution was buffered due to improved proton conduction between the anode and cathode. The long-term stability of the ZnO films was studied via controlled potential electrolysis over 12 hour of illumination. The lifetime of the catalyst films increased from approximately 2 hours at neutral pH to beyond 12 hours in mildly alkaline pH buffers. The optimum operating conditions were at pH 10.5 (borate buffer) where >75% of the initial photoactivity was retained after 12 hours of catalyst operation. This result was corroborated by ICP-MS analysis of the Zn-content of the electrolyte solutions after 12 hours, which showed a minimum zinc “leakage” from the film. These findings could be used to improve the lifetime of other high-performing ZnO-based catalysts. The screen-printed ZnO anode materials are promising candidates for integration with dark co-catalysts, such as electrodeposited or screen-printed water oxidising metal oxides. Sensitization of the ZnO films with light-harvesting dyes could also be a promising approach for future applications, and with their activity further enhanced, ZnO films could represent an attractive option for commercial water splitting.
