    , Accepted 4th July 2016First published on 5th July 2016AbstractMicro-sized Gd6O5F8 particles doped with Yb3+, Ho3+ and Li+ ions have been synthesized by a facile hydrothermal route. The dual-model up- and down-conversion luminescence was investigated under visible blue (VIS-B) light (451 nm) and near infrared (NIR) light (980 nm) excitations. The structural properties of the products are analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Upon excitation to the 2F5/2 level of Yb3+ using a 980 nm laser diode, Gd6O5F8:Yb3+,Ho3+ exhibits intense up-converted green and red emission at 545 nm and 660 nm, which correspond to the 5S2 → 5I8 and 5F5 → 5I8 transitions of Ho3+, respectively. The nearly quadratic dependence of the green/red emission intensity on the excitation power indicates that a two-photon up-conversion process was involved to populate the green (5S2) and red levels (5F5) of Ho3+. In contrast, upon excitation Ho3+ to its 5F1 level by 451 nm blue light, both visible and near-infrared emissions peaking at 545 nm, 660 nm, 980 nm and 1191 nm are simultaneously observed in the emission spectra, which are assigned to the 5S2 → 5I8 (Ho3+), 5F5 → 5I8 (Ho3+), 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 (Yb3+) and 5I6 → 5I8 (Ho3+) transitions, respectively. Meanwhile, the emission intensities of the up-converted green emission and down-converted emissions were further enhanced by co-doping Li+, which can be confirmed by the fact that the emission intensities of the up-converted green emission and down-converted NIR emission were increased 50% and 90% after co-doping 7% Li+. The energy transfer processes between Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions and the mechanisms of Li+ doping for the emission enhancement have been investigated and discussed. Additionally, the time-resolved luminescence traces are measured, and the luminescence lifetimes of the Ho3+ ions are calculated. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent up-conversion and down-shifted luminescence of Gd6O5F8:Yb3+,Ho3+,Li+ are investigated, and the results show that the ratio of up-converted green to red emission as well as the ratio of down-shifted green to blue emission in Gd6O5F8:Yb3+,Ho3+,Li+ all respond single exponentially to temperature, which could be applied to sense temperature.
Introduction
Lanthanide (Ln3+) ions are generally used as luminescence centers of phosphors because of their abundant electronic states, long-lived intermediate meta-stable states and ladder-like arranged energy levels.1 Micro-materials doped with Ln3+ ions have gained significant attention, not only for basic scientific interest but also for their diverse applications in flat-panel displays, solar cells, three-dimensional display technologies, bio-imaging, etc.2–5 Moreover, the abundance of 4f electronic states of Ln3+ ions generally result in multiple overlapping emission bands, and it is necessary to quantify or purify the emission color in some special applications such as displays and illuminating fields.6 Consequently, spectrally pure single band three primary color (red, green and blue) emissions in a single material were strongly desired in various applications in pixelated 2D/3D displays.7,8
Materials are able to convert short wavelength light into longer wavelength light, among which a special case is that they can convert one absorbed photon with higher energy to two photons with lower energy, which is called a down-conversion (DC) process when the appropriate combinations of Ln3+ dopants are selected. And the reverse process called up-conversion (UC) is also possible; UC is a process in which two or more photons from the infrared or NIR range can be converted to photons with a higher energy. What is more, due to their potential applications, materials that exhibit UC properties have attracted particular attention.9–17 There is growing interest in researching UC micro-particles (MPs) for solving current challenges in bio-imaging, cancer diagnosis and therapy, and in the utilization of solar energy and security markers.18–20 Materials that exhibit both DC and UC properties simultaneously are especially interesting, as well as extremely rare, which can be called dual-mode luminescence.
Rare-earth oxy-fluorides have comparatively low phonon energy relative to the oxide matrix, as well as the high chemical and mechanical stability of fluorides, and they have become a research focus in the field of UC materials. However, enhancement in the efficiency of UC materials is still a key scientific problem. The luminescence intensity of Ln3+ ions can be improved by co-doping with elememnts such as, bismuth, lithium, calcium, barium, strontium, aluminium, magnesium, zinc, silver, gold and manganese.21–33 Due to its small size, the Li+ ion can easily enter into the host lattice, occupying not only the substitutional sites but also the interstitial sites, which can enhance the UC luminescence by breaking or distorting the crystal field around lanthanide ions.34,35
The morphologies and multifunctional luminescence properties of micro-sized Gd(OH)2.14F0.86/Gd6O5F8:Eu3+/Tb3+/Tm3+ have been explored in detail.36 In the present study, we reported the dual-model up/down-conversion luminescence of Gd6O5F8:Yb3+,Ho3+, and examined the influence of Li+-co-doping on its up/down-conversion properties, as well as investigating and discussing the energy transfer processes between Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions and the luminescence intensity enhancement mechanisms of Li+ doping. In addition, the temperature sensing behaviors in the developed phosphor have been investigated.
Experimental
Gd6O5F8:Yb3+,Ho3+,Li+ was synthesized using a hydrothermal method at pH = 8 at 180 °C for 10 h followed by post-annealing at 600 °C for 3 h. The synthesis process is similar to the one reported in ref. 36, except Yb2O3, Ho2O3 and Li2CO3 were used as dopants. The raw materials Gd2O3, NH4F, Yb2O3, Ho2O3 and Li2CO3 were all purchased from General Nonferrous Metals Research Institute, Beijing, and used directly without further purification.
Characteristics
The phase purity was determined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D2 PHASER X-ray diffractometer with a graphite monochromator using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å), operating at 30 kV and 15 mA with a scanning step of 0.02° in the 2θ range from 10° to 80°. The morphologies of the as-prepared samples were inspected using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi, S-4800). The UC photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured by using a 980 nm laser diode as the excitation source, with a HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer system. PL and PL excitation (PLE) spectra were recorded using an FLS-920T spectrophotometer with Xe 900 (450 W xenon arc lamp) as the light source. Thermal quenching was tested using a heating apparatus (TAP-02) in combination with PL equipment.
Results and discussion
Structure and morphology
No additional secondary phase, impurities or amorphous forms are found in all synthesized samples Gd6O5F8:Yb3+,Ho3+,Li+. The crystallographic data of Y6O5F8 (JCPDS no. 52-1810) with space group Pcmb (no. 57) were used as the starting model for Gd6O5F8. Rietveld refinement on the XRD pattern of Gd6O5F8 has been explored in detail in ref. 36. As an example, Fig. 1a presents the XRD patterns of the Li+-free and 7%-Li-doped Gd6O5F8:Yb3+,Ho3+ samples. It is found that the intensity of the main diffraction peak increases 30% and the positions of the diffraction peaks shift toward a larger angle, suggesting that Li+ ions are incorporated into the host and Li+-doping improves the crystallinity of samples (see Fig. 1b). This result confirmed that high Li+-doping levels are achievable in the Gd6O5F8 host material without altering the structure of the host under the given synthesis conditions.

Fig. 1c and d show a morphology comparison between the Li+-free and 7%-Li+ doped samples. The Li+-free sample has a hexagonal prism shape with an inhomogeneous distribution (Fig. 1c), while the Li+-co-doped sample shows a uniform and smooth-certain-face rod-like shape (Fig. 1d), indicating that introducing Li+ ions influences the crystal growth process of Gd6O5F8:Yb3+,Ho3+.
UC and DC luminescence properties of MPs
The luminescence of the Gd6O5F8:Yb3+,Ho3+ MPs exhibits a dual nature. These MPs can be excited by NIR radiation due to Yb3+ absorption and energy transfer between dopant ions or by UV radiation due to the f–d and f–f electronic transitions within the Ho3+ ions. Both excitation methods yield efficient green luminescence of the Ho3+ ions. Due to their complex spectroscopic nature and interactions between the ions, they can exchange energy, transfer charge and undergo other processes. The presence of Yb3+ and Ho3+ dopant ions strongly influences the observed luminescence properties, because these ions are responsible for dual mode excitation. To evaluate the luminescence performance of the as-synthesized MPs, UC and DC luminescence spectra of the obtained sample are recorded and are shown in Fig. 2 and 3, respectively.

The UC emission spectra of the as-synthesized Gd6O5F8:Yb3+,Ho3+ phosphors excited by a continuous NIR 980 nm laser at room temperature are presented in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The emission spectra are composed of intense green emission at 545 nm and relatively weak red emission at 660 nm, which are assigned to 5F4/5S2 → 5I8 and 5F5 → 5I8 transitions of Ho3+, respectively. The UC emission spectra of Gd6O5F8:xYb3+,2%Ho3+ (x = 1%, 3%, 5% and 7%) are excited by a 980 nm diode laser with an excitation power of 99 mW (see Fig. 2a). It is clearly observed that the intensity of the red and green emissions increases initially and reaches the maximum when x = 5%, and then decreases with the further increase in Yb3+ doping concentration. This is caused by the concentration quenching effect. Upon increasing the Yb3+ ions' concentration above the optimum value (5%), the distance between the Ho3+–Yb3+ ions decrease, which may promote non-radiative energy back transfer (EBT) from Ho3+ to Yb3+ and result in the reduction of the UC emission intensity (see Fig. 4). For the emission spectra of samples with constant Yb3+ contents (x = 5%) but variable Ho3+ contents, the variation in emission spectra is similar to the case of fixing the Ho3+ concentration and changing the Yb3+ concentration (see Fig. 2b). Due to the concentration quenching effect, the UC emission intensity starts to decrease, when the concentration of Ho3+ exceeds 0.3%. From the results presented in Fig. 2a and b, the optimum doping concentrations of Ho3+ and Yb3+ are determined to be 0.3% and 5%, respectively.
 Fig. 4  Proposed UC and DC energy transfer process occurring in Gd6O5F8:Yb3+,Ho3+. 
The typical DC luminescence excitation spectrum is measured by monitoring the emission at 545 nm (show Fig. 3a). The spectrum contains narrow bands in the 350–500 nm range from the f–f transitions of Ho3+ ions. Among these bands, the strongest excitation peak at 451 nm results from the 5I8 → 5F2, 3K8 transitions, while other excitation bands at 362, 419 and 489 nm originate from the 5I8 → 5G4, 3K7, 5I8 → 5G5 and 5I8 → 5F3 transitions, respectively. In the DC process, the Yb3+ concentration has no distinct influence on the emission intensity, which may alter slightly the crystal field around the Ho3+ ions.37 The DC emission spectra of samples with various Ho3+ concentrations (0.3 and 2.0%) and a constant Yb3+ concentration (5%) are presented in Fig. 3b, which are similar to those obtained by NIR (980 nm) excitation, except for the additional emission peak at 490 nm from the 5F3 → 5I8 transition and NIR emissions from 870 nm to 1300 nm. The strongest DC emission peak after excitation at 545 nm with VIS-B radiation can be observed, which comes from the 5F4/5S2 → 5I8 Ho3+ electronic transition. In the NIR region (870 nm–1300 nm), two strong emissions are observed, one centered at 980 nm, and the other at 1191 nm, which are assigned to the DC transitions of 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 (Yb3+)/5S2 → 5I6 (Ho3+) and 5I6 → 5I8 (Ho3+), respectively.
According to the above results, possible energy processes upon NIR excitation and blue light excitation occurring in the Gd6O5F8:Yb3+,Ho3+ MPs are presented in Fig. 4. The diagram summarizes the interactions between the dopant ions that are responsible for the observed NIR- and VIS-B-excited, dual-mode luminescence and other spectroscopic properties.
Upon 980 nm NIR light excitation, the 5I6 state of the Ho3+ ion is populated through ground state absorption (GSA) of a 980 nm photon as well as by energy transfer (ET) from Yb3+ to Ho3+ ions. Owing to the larger absorption cross-section at 980 nm of Yb3+ than that of Ho3+, the ET process is more predominant than the GSA process. The excited ions in the 5I6 state are again promoted to the 5F4/5S2 or 5F3 level by excited state absorption and an efficient energy transfer process. The population of the metastable state 5I4 is a result of the cross-relaxation (CR) process and could be excited to the upper level 5F2 by the ET process. Then the populated 5F2 state is relaxed the 5F4/5S2 level through a non-radiation (NR) transition. In the above processes, two-photon process plays a main role due to the low probability of CR. Thus, the populated 5F4/5S2 level relaxes radiatively to ground states 5I8 and emits intense green emission around 545 nm. A part of the population in these states can also relax to the 5F5 level via multi-phonon relaxation and from there radiative relaxation to the ground state gives red emission at about 660 nm. The red emission strongly depends on the NR transition probability.
After their excitation by VIS-B irradiation (451 nm), the 5F1 state of the Ho3+ ion is populated through the transition of the 5I8 state, from which the NR transition occurs that emits green light, red light and NIR light at 490 nm, 545 nm, 660 nm and 1020 nm and 1191 nm, respectively. In view of the energy match between the Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions, the Ho3+ ion could relax from the 5F5 level to the 5I7 level or from the 5S2 level to the 5I6 level and then transfer its energy to only one Yb3+ ion, which belongs to the CR process. Thus, the NIR emission of Yb3+ ions at 980 nm is obtained.
The effects of Li+-co-doping on UC and DC emission in Gd6O5F8:Yb3+,Ho3+

Fig. 5 shows the UC luminescence spectra of Gd6O5F8:5%Yb3+,0.3% Ho3+,xLi+ (x = 0%, 7%) under 980 nm excitation. Co-doped Li+ ions significantly enhance the green emission at 545 nm but have little influence on the red emission at 660 nm (see Fig. 5a), which can be seen by the observation that the green emission at 545 nm increases by 47%, while the red emission changes slightly when the 7% Li+ ions are incorporated into Gd6O5F8:5%Yb3+,0.3%Ho3+ (see Table 1, the visual CIE diagram is shown in Fig. 10). Meanwhile, the green to red ratio is increased from 2.99 to 3.77 upon co-doping with Li+, and the CIE colour coordinates shift towards the pure green region, which indicates an improvement in the purity of the green colour emitted from the sample due to the change in the crystal microstructure. Fig. 5b and c present the dependence of the UC emission of Li+ free-doped and Li+ co-doped samples on the pumped power, respectively. For the unsaturated UC process, the number of photons required to populate the upper emitting state can be described by the following relation:38 Iup ∝ Pn(1)where Iup is the UC emission intensity, P is the pump laser intensity, and n is the number of pump photons required. The slope (n values) obtained are 1.64 and 1.52 for the 545 nm and 660 nm emissions in the Gd6O5F8:5%Yb3+,0.3%Ho3+ sample and that are 1.70 and 1.56 for the Gd6O5F8:5%Yb3+,0.3%Ho3+,7%Li+ sample (see Fig. 5b and c). Both results indicated that a two-photon process was involved to populate the green (5S2/5F4) and red levels (5F5) in the Li+-free and Li+-doped samples. Since Li+ has no energy levels in the NIR region, it can neither absorb 980 nm light nor transfer its energy to Ho3+, as a result, it is considered that Li+ doping will not affect the up-conversion mechanisms in Gd6O5F8:5%Yb3+,0.3%Ho3+. However, it is found that the n values change slightly with the change of Li+ ion concentration and are smaller than those of the Li+-free sample. According to relation (1), a larger UC rate may mean a smaller slope (n values). Introducing Li+ can increase the UC rate leading to the enhancement of the UC luminescence intensity.39 It is assumed that this significant enhancement in the UC emission intensity is due to the presence of the local field around the Ho3+ ions followed by the substitutional effect and the crystallinity of the samples. The smaller ionic radii of the Li+ ions replace the larger ionic radii of the Gd3+ ions, hence inducing a contraction in the host lattice, and then improving the crystallinity of the samples which can be proved by XRD and SEM. Due to the substitutional effect, the local crystal field symmetry around the rare earth ion (Ho3+) is modified.40

The normalized UC decay profiles of the 5S2/5F4 → 5I8 (545 nm) transitions for Gd6O5F8:5%Yb3+,0.3%Ho3+ MPs without and with 7% Li+ ions are measured (see Fig. 6). All decay curves of the samples could be well fitted to a double exponential function.41 The fitted lifetimes of the Ho3+ ions for Gd6O5F8:5%Yb3+,0.3%Ho3+,xLi+ (x = 0, 7%) MPs are shown in Fig. 6, where τ1 and τ2 represent the rise and decay times of the transient for the exponential components. The average lifetime can be determined by the following equation:42 (2)where A and τ represent the amplitude and lifetime corresponding to the depopulated level, respectively. The average lifetime of the 5S2/5F4 states of Ho3+ in Gd6O5F8:5%Yb3+,0.3%Ho3+ and Gd6O5F8:5%Yb3+,0.3%Ho3+,7%Li+ is determined to be 58.05 and 83.38 μs, respectively. Doping Li+ ions can prolong the lifetime of the 5S2/5F4 state, which could arise from the tailored local environment of the Ho3+ ions.43 The long lifetime of the 5S2/5F4 state can lead to strong green UC luminescence, which agrees well with the experiment results shown in Fig. 5.42,43
 Fig. 6  UC normalized luminescence decay curve of 5S2/5F4 → 5I8 (545 nm) transitions in Gd6O5F8:5%Yb3+,0.3%Ho3+ MPs with (a) 0% Li+ ions; (b) 7% Li+ ions excited at 980 nm. 
The DC emission spectra and decay curves of Gd6O5F8:5%Yb3+,0.3%Ho3+,xLi+ (x = 0%, 7%) MPs are measured by 451 nm excitation (see Fig. 7), which is similar to the UC luminescence (see Fig. 5), Li+ doping greatly increases the DC luminescence intensity. In particular, in the VIS region, the green emission increases 89% and the ratio of green to red emission is increased from 26.12 to 44.11 by co-doping Li+ (see Table 1, the visual CIE diagram is shown in Fig. 10). In the NIR region, it can be observed that the peak at 1191 nm dramatically increases, while that at 980 nm decreases slightly with the introduction of Li+ ions. The doping with Li+ ions has greatly increased the purity of the green colour leading the colour coordinates to shift slightly towards the pure green region due to the change in the crystal microstructure. The DC luminescence decay curves of 5S2/5F4 → 5I8 (545 nm) transitions for Gd6O5F8:5%Yb3+,0.3%Ho3+,xLi+ (x = 0%, 7%) MPs excited by 451 nm excitation are presented in Fig. 7b and c, respectively. Their fitting exponential function is also similar to that of UC, which is a double exponential function, τ1 and τ2 represent the rise and decay times of the transient for the exponential components. The calculated values for the lifetimes are τ1 for the short component and τ2 for the long component.44 From Fig. 7b and c, it can be calculated that the lifetime of the sample with no doped Li+ ions is shorter than that with doping 7% Li+ ions, 104.49 and 111.78 μs, respectively, presumably due to surface effects.45 The phenomenon indicates that the Li+ ion co-doping has enhanced the DC luminescence intensity.

To sum up, the introduction of Li+ ions can increase the intensities of UC and DC luminescence.
Temperature sensing properties of UC and DC in Gd6O5F8:Yb3+,Ho3+,Li+
To investigate whether Gd6O5F8:Yb3+,Ho3+,Li+ can be used to sense temperature, the temperature dependent UC and DC emission spectra are measured (see Fig. 8 and 9).
 Fig. 8  (a) Temperature dependent UC emission spectra of Gd6O5F8:5%Yb3+,0.3%Ho3+,7%Li+ samples; (b) the normalized intensities of green and red light; (c) single exponential fitting of the ratio of green (540 nm) to red (660 nm) emission to temperature.

For the temperature dependent UC emission spectra, it can be observed that the UC emissions of bands centred at 545 nm and 660 nm decreased with the increase of the heating temperatures but the peak positions do not shift (see Fig. 8a), and the green emission decreases much faster than the red emission (see Fig. 8b). Then, at higher temperature (498 K) red emission will be stronger than green. The variation in the intensity ratio of green to red emission has been estimated and is displayed in Fig. 8c. With the increase of the heating temperature, the ratio of green to red emission decreases rapidly, presenting a good single exponential relationship, hence the purity of the green colour emitted from the sample reduces. Furthermore, the CIE colour coordinates of the UC luminescence shift from the green region to the red region, and result in a lower resolution (see Table 2, the visual CIE diagram is shown in Fig. 10).

For the temperature dependent DC emission spectra, the down-converted green emission at 545 nm decreases with the increase of temperature, and its intensity decreases slightly when the temperature reaches 423 K; in contrast, the intensity of the weak blue-green emission at 490 nm increases with the increase of temperature, however, the increased magnitude is very small (see Fig. 9b). The CIE colour coordinates of the DC luminescence also shift from the green area to the red area, which is similar to that of UC (see Table 2, the visual CIE diagram is shown in Fig. 10).
 Fig. 10  Numbers represent the CIE colour coordinates of UC and DC, respectively: 1,3 without Li+ co-doping; 2 and 4 with 7% Li+ co-doping; the red arrows with ‘DC’ sign show the effects of temperature on the CIE colour coordinates (x, y) in DC of Gd6O5F8:5%Yb3+,0.3%Ho3+,7%Li+; the red arrows with ‘UC’ sign in the illustration show the effects of temperature on the CIE colour coordinates (x, y) in UC of Gd6O5F8:5%Yb3+,0.3%Ho3+,7%Li+. 
Nevertheless, compared with the two CIE colour coordinates in UC and DC at different temperatures, the CIE colour coordinates of DC luminescence shift less than those of UC luminescence.
Conclusion
In conclusion, micro-sized Ho3+/Yb3+-doped Gd6O5F8 has been synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. This phosphor can be efficiently excited by blue light at 451 nm and near infrared light at 980 nm, giving strong down-converted emission at 1191 nm and up-converted emission at 545 nm and 660 nm, respectively. Both up-converted and down-converted emission can be further improved by Li+ doping. The main reason responsible for the enhancement is discussed, which can be attributed to the improvement of the crystallinity and an increase in the transition probability of emitting states. The up-conversion and down-conversion purities of the green colour emitted from samples improve, and the CIE colour coordinates are closer to the ideal values. Furthermore, both the ratios of the up-converted green (545 nm) to red emission (660 nm) and down-converted green (545 nm) to blue-green (490 nm) emission respond single exponentially to temperature, which could enable this phosphor to be used to sense temperature. The present Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped Gd6O5F8 phosphors offer good green up-converted and down-converted emission and could be considered as potential candidates for displays and illuminating technology.
