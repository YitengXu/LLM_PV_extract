    , Accepted 19th June 2017First published on 21st June 2017AbstractTin (Sn) halide perovskite absorbers have attracted much interest because of their nontoxicity as compared to their lead (Pb) halide perovskite counterparts. Recent progress shows that the power conversion efficiency of FASnI3 (FA = HC(NH2)2) solar cells prevails over that of MASnI3 (MA = CH3NH3). In this paper, we show that the organic cations, i.e., FA and MA, play a vital role in the defect properties of Sn halide perovskites. The antibonding coupling between Sn-5s and I-5p is clearly weaker in FASnI3 than in MASnI3 due to the larger ionic size of FA, leading to higher formation energies of Sn vacancies in FASnI3. Subsequently, the conductivity of FASnI3 can be tuned from p-type to intrinsic by varying the growth conditions of the perovskite semiconductor; in contrast, MASnI3 shows unipolar high p-type conductivity independent of the growth conditions. This provides a reasonable explanation for the better performance of FASnI3-based solar cells in experiments with respect to the MASnI3-based solar cells.
I. Introduction
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of methylammonium lead tri-halide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) has skyrocketed from less than 5% to over 22%,1–11 in the past few years, due to the extraordinary optoelectronic properties of perovskite semiconductors.12–14 The possibility for fabricating PVSCs using low cost solution processes makes them an even more appealing photovoltaic technology. Considering the broad applications and commercialization, a key scientific challenge is to replace the toxic Pb in the perovskite absorber with nontoxic elements, such as Sn, Ge, etc. In 2014, Kanatzidis's group and Snaith's group independently demonstrated methylammonium tin iodide (MASnI3, MA = CH3NH3) based Pb-free PVSCs with PCEs of around 6%.15,16 However, very limited progress based on the MASnI3 system has been made over the past two years probably due to the instability and poor reproducibility of the material. Recently, formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI3, FA = HC(NH2)2) based Pb-free perovskite solar cells have started to attract further attention,17,18 with Yan's group reporting efficient FASnI3-based solar cells with a PCE of up to 6.22% and much better device reproducibility.19 Nevertheless, there were very limited studies dedicated to understanding the intrinsic difference of the material properties between FASnI3 and MASnI3,20–26 which is critically important to further improve the performance of the Pb-free perovskite solar cells.
One important approach to provide better insights into the material properties of perovskites is through theoretical investigation.27–29 In 2014, Wei's group studied the defect properties of inorganic Pb-free perovskite semiconductor CsSnI3 and depicted the influence of defects and synthesis conditions on the photovoltaic performance.27 They found that due to the strong Sn 5s–I 5p antibonding coupling, Sn vacancies have very low formation energies in CsSnI3, leading to a very high concentration of Sn vacancies and therefore high p-type conductivity, regardless of the growth conditions. As a consequence, CsSnI3 behaves like a conductor, rather than a semiconductor, limiting its application for photovoltaic devices. To our surprise, similar calculations had not been applied for comparing the defect properties of the MASnI3 and FASnI3 semiconductors despite that these systems were widely used for device demonstrations.
Therefore, in this letter, we study theoretically the defect properties of the two Pb-free Sn-based organic–inorganic perovskites, FASnI3 and MASnI3. We reveal that the larger ionic size of FA weakens the antibonding coupling between Sn-5s and I-5p as compared to MA. This leads to lower formation energies of Sn vacancies in FASnI3 than those in MASnI3, and thus results in a much smaller hole density in the FASnI3 system in comparison with that in MASnI3. We find that the conductivity of FASnI3 can be tuned from p-type to intrinsic by varying the growth conditions. Meanwhile, MASnI3 shows a unipolar p-type conductivity with very high hole densities, which is unfavorable for efficient solar cell applications. These results explain the experimental observations that FASnI3-based solar cells generally perform better than MASnI3-based solar cells.
II. Theoretical methods
The electronic structure calculations of the Sn-based perovskites, MASnI3 and FASnI3 were performed based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code30 with the standard frozen-core projector augmented-wave (PAW) method.31,32 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)33 functional is employed for the exchange–correlation potential. The cut-off energy for basis functions is 400 eV and the k-point mesh was obtained using the Monkhorst–Pack34 method with a reasonable grid density. The defect calculations are based on a (3 × 3 × 3) or (3 × 2 × 2) supercell with a single G point. The lattices of supercells with defects are fixed based on the optimized primitive cell. Atoms are fully relaxed until the Hellmann–Feynman forces on them are within 0.05 eV Å−1. The energy difference per atom between the calculations with 400 eV and 500 eV cutoff energies is less than 2 meV. Moreover, the lattice changes are within 1% for the primitive cell when the cutoff energy changes from 400 eV to 500 eV. Projected crystal orbital Hamilton population (pCOHP) curves are calculated using the computer program LOBSTER (Local-Orbital Basis Suite Towards Electronic-Structure Reconstruction), which enables chemical-bonding analysis based on the periodic plane-wave DFT output.35–37
For defect calculations, more accurate functionals are preferred in general, for example, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof hybrid functional with the spin–orbit coupling (HSE-SOC) would be better.38,39 Practically, however, HSE and HSE-SOC calculations are very time consuming and show a similar high defect tolerance in perovskites.38 For FASnI3, our PBE calculated bandgap (1.19 eV) is only slightly narrower than the experimental bandgap of 1.4 eV.19 The PBE calculations of FASnI3 with SOC and without SOC are depicted in Fig. 1S† for showing the small change of bandgap values which is 0.21 eV, unlike the situation in Pb-based perovskites.40 So the PBE-SOC calculated bandgap is 0.98 eV, which is 0.42 eV smaller than the experiential bandgap. Fortunately, we found later that the doping properties are mainly determined by the shallow defects, such as Sn vacancies, MA or FA vacancies, I vacancies, MA or FA interstitials. The shallow defect levels typically shift with the band edges whose characteristics will not be changed with and without SOC.
The transition and formation energies41 of intrinsic defects were calculated by equations below ε(0/q) = [εΓD(0) − εΓVBM(host)] + [E(α,q) − (E(α,q) − qεκD(0))]/(−q)(1) ΔHf(α,q) = ΔE(α,q) + ∑niμi + qEF(2)Here ε(0/q) is the transition energy, ΔHf is the defect formation energy, and E(α,q) is the total energy for a supercell containing a defect α in a charge state of q. The formation energy also depends on the atomic chemical potentials μi and the electron Fermi energy EF.
III. Results and discussion
FASnI3 has an orthorhombic (Amm2) crystal structure,19 and MASnI3 has a pseudocubic crystal (P4mm) structure.15 Both structures are established on the basic octahedral Sn–I framework. Fig. 1(a) shows the atomic structure of FASnI3, with the white, red and light blue ones representing the organic FA molecule, I atom, and Sn atom respectively. The calculated band structure of the FASnI3 system is depicted in Fig. 1(b) showing a direct band gap value of 1.19 eV, which is in line with the experimental value (1.4 eV).19 In the Pb halide perovskite systems, the unique s–p antibonding coupling contributes significantly to their remarkable optoelectronic properties. In the Sn-based systems, obvious Sn-5s and I-5p antibonding was also formed at the VBM, which is indicated by the charge distribution in Fig. 1(c).

Considering the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, the existence of FASnI3 should satisfy μFA + μSn + 3μI = ΔHf(FASnI3) = −4.67 eV(3)where μi (i = FA, Sn, and I) is the chemical potential of the constituent element referring to its most stable phase and ΔHf(FASnI3) is the formation enthalpy of FASnI3. For μFA, we choose a body-centered-cubic phase of FA which was also found in the Cs counterpart. To exclude the possible secondary phases of SnI2, SnI4, FAI (rock-salt phase) and FA2SnI6, the following constraints must also be satisfied: μFA + μI < ΔHf(FAI) = −2.91 eV(4) μSn + 2μI < ΔHf(SnI2) = −1.55 eV(5) μSn + 4μI < ΔHf(SnI4) = −1.94 eV(6) 2μFA + μSn + 6μI < ΔHf(FA2SnI6) = −7.98 eV(7)
The chemical potentials of Sn and I satisfying eqn (3)–(7) are shown as the red region in Fig. 1(d). Different from the Pb-based system, the narrow chemical range will be cut off partially by the competing SnI4 and FA2SnI6 phases. The narrow red chemical range indicates that the growth conditions for synthesizing the FASnI3 phase should be carefully controlled, which is also indicated by the small dissociation energy of 0.21 eV of FASnI3 to FAI and SnI2.
To evaluate how the organic cations may affect the defect properties, we have calculated the transition energies and formation energies of the most possible intrinsic point defects, including FA, Sn, and I vacancies (VFA, VSn, and VI), FA, Sn and I interstitials (FAi, Sni, and Ii), FA on Sn and Sn on FA cation substitutions (FASn and SnFA) and four antisite substitutions, FA on I (FAI), Sn on I (SnI), I on FA (IFA), and I on Sn (ISn). The transition energies of these twelve defects are shown in Fig. 2S(a) (see ESI†). Since the formation energies of point defects depend on the chemical potentials of the constituent elements, we have chosen three typical points, labeled A (I-rich/Sn-poor), B (moderate) and C (I-poor/Sn-rich), in the chemical range shown in Fig. 1(d). The formation energies of the considered point defects as a function of the Fermi level position at chemical potential point A, B, and C are shown in Fig. 2(a), (b) and (c), respectively. At point A or B, FASnI3 shows good p-type characteristics due to the dominant acceptor VSn with the lowest formation energy. At point C, FASnI3 should be an intrinsic (low conductivity) semiconductor as the dominant donor FAi will compensate for acceptor VSn and the Fermi level will be pinned at the middle location of the band gap, pointed out by the black arrow in Fig. 2(c). These results indicated that the conductivity of FASnI3 strongly depends on the growth conditions and it is possible to tune its conductivity by choosing the desired growth conditions. In FASnI3, the dominant donor FAi and dominant acceptors VSn have comparable formation energies. The low formation energy of VSn in FASnI3 is due to the energetically unfavorable s–p antibonding coupling, which resembles the s–p antibonding coupling in MAPbI3 (ref. 42) and the p–d antibonding coupling in CuInSe.43 The fully occupied antibonding state between Sn-5s and I-5p coupling does not gain energy significantly and thus tends to break a weak bond and easily forms a vacancy. The lower formation energy of FAi could be expected due to the weak van der Waals interaction formed between the organic molecule FA and the Sn–I framework.

However, the situation in the MASnI3 system is different. We have calculated the twelve intrinsic defects in analogy with FASnI3, including three vacancies VMA, VSn, and VI, three interstitial defects MAi, Sni, and Ii and six substitutions MASn, SnMA, FAI, SnI, IFA and ISn (see Fig. 2S(b), ESI†). The small dissociation energy of MASnI3 to MAI and SnI2 is 0.23 eV. Here we also have chosen three typical growth conditions with different chemical potentials similar to the case in the FASnI3 model, point A still represents the I-rich/Sn-poor environment, B is the moderate one, and C represents the I-poor/Sn-rich environment indicated by Fig. 3S (ESI†). No matter how the chemical potential is varied, VSn is the invariable dominant defect under different growth conditions, with the lowest formation energy across the whole Fermi energy range as shown in Fig. 3(a)–(c). Such a phenomenon could be attributed to the energetically unfavorable s–p antibonding coupling, which leads to the low formation energies of Sn vacancies in the MASnI3 system. Under the I-poor/Sn-rich condition C, we also found that the defect VI could be formed easily, which becomes a dominant defect in the wide Fermi level region. Therefore, the stronger s–p antibonding coupling in MASnI3, compared with that in FASnI3, leads to invariably the lowest formation energies of Sn vacancies in MASnI3.44

For the Pb-free Sn-based perovskite systems, the VBM is also derived from the I-5p and Sn-5s orbitals. The coupling strength will finally determine the energy position of the VBM. The average Sn–I bond length is 3.31 Å in FASnI3, which is longer than that of 3.23 Å in MASnI3. As mentioned above, the shorter bond length will result in stronger anti-bonding coupling, which leads to an increase of the VBM of MASnI3 to a higher energy level in comparison with that in FASnI3. Furthermore, in order to provide a better picture on the distribution of electronic states in the two Sn-based systems, their partial densities of states (DOSs) were calculated and are shown in Fig. 4. After aligning the I-5p levels, indicated by the grey arrow, it is clearly seen that the upper Sn-5s level is higher in energy in FASnI3 than in MASnI3. The fact that the Sn-5s orbital energy in MASnI3 is higher than that in FASnI3 is consistent with the average Sn–I bond lengths in FASnI3 and MASnI3, mainly due to the smaller size of the MA molecule, as compared with FA. Consequently, the VSn defects will have relatively lower formation energies in MASnI3 than in FASnI3 under similar growth conditions.

The difference of antibonding coupling in FASnI3 and MASnI3 has been depicted qualitatively according to the comparison of their electronic properties. To take one step further, we also performed quantitative analysis based on the −pCOHP calculation, which had been used to analyze the chemical bonding/antibonding type and bonding strength45,46 and applied in perovskite systems.28,46 Here the energy window from EVBM − 2 eV to EVBM + 2.5 eV is set to compare the bonding of Sn-5s and I-5p around the VBM. The blue line and the blue area represent the −pCOHP of MASnI3 and its integration, respectively, while the red ones represent those of the FASnI3. Obviously, the orbital overlap population of MASnI3 is much higher than the one of FASnI3 shown in Fig. 5, which further emphasizes the weaker antibonding coupling of Sn-5s and I-5p in FASnI3.

IV. Conclusion
With a theoretical investigation of intrinsic defects of FASnI3 and MASnI3 under possible growth conditions, we reveal that the semiconductor nature of FASnI3 can be tuned from p-type to intrinsic by changing the growth conditions, while MASnI3 shows a unipolar p-type characteristic with very high hole density. This explains the experimental observations of a better PCE performance of FASnI3-based solar cells with respect to the MASnI3-based one. Furthermore, we found that the higher formation energy of Sn vacancies in FASnI3 is mainly due to the weaker Sn-5s and I-5p antibonding coupling originating from the larger size of FA and longer bond length of Sn–I, which suggests that composition engineering of Sn-based perovskites would be an important strategy to improve the physical properties of the material.

Note: we notice that the formation energies of Sn vacancies are negative in the whole Fermi energy range at point A (I-rich/Sn-poor) for both FASnI3 and MASnI3 (cf.Fig. 2(a) and 3(a)) are unphysical, and it is attributed to some unknown competing defected phases of ternaries although we have taken FA2SnI6, MA2SnI6 and SnI4 into consideration. The relative formation energy of Sn vacancies in FASnI3 and MASnI3, as well as the main conclusions of the letter, will not be affected by further refinement of the stable chemical potential ranges.
