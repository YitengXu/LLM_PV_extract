    , Accepted 7th October 2012First published on 11th October 2012AbstractVertically oriented graphene (VG) nanosheets are synthesized for counter electrodes (CEs) of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The VG electrode exhibits charge transfer resistance about 1% of the Pt electrode and improves power conversion efficiency of DSSCs from 4.68% (for Pt CEs) to 5.36%.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) represent a viable alternative to silicon-based solar cells due to their potential low cost, easy fabrication, and high efficiency (over 12%).1–3 In a typical DSSC operation, the iodide (I−) in the electrolyte is oxidized at the dye-sensitized porous nanocrystalline TiO2 under illumination, while the triiodide (I3−) is reduced at the counter electrode (CE) for the purpose of dye regeneration. The counter electrode usually consists of a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer deposited with a thin layer of catalyst. Platinum is often selected for use as the catalyst because it has high catalytic activity toward I3− reduction and is sufficiently corrosion-resistant to the iodine species present in the electrolyte.4–7 However, since platinum is a highly valued metal, much incentive exists to develop DSSC counter electrodes using cheaper, more abundant materials that are equal or greater in their catalytic activity.
Many inorganic materials, including metal oxides, nitrides, carbides, sulfides, selenides, have been studied as potential counter electrodes in DSSCs.8–13 Along with inorganic materials, carbon nanomaterials and carbon–metal composites have attracted attention due to their activity for I3− reduction, high electronic conductivity, and easy availability.14–18 It is advantageous to use carbon nanomaterials because of their electrical conductivity and extremely large and tunable surface area. Manipulating these nanostructures also allows for the control and use of defect-rich edge plane materials, which facilitate the electron kinetics associated with the reduction of I3−.19 Graphene has emerged as a potential catalyst for a DSSC cathode due to graphene's exceptional specific surface area and conductivity.20–23 Kavan et al., for example, have used graphene nanoplatelets in the form of thin semitransparent films on F-doped SnO2 (FTO) to achieve a photo-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.4%, exceeding their platinum control cell at 8.2% (with Co(bpy)33+/2+ electrolyte).21 Aksay et al. reasoned that the catalytic activity in graphene may be due to the oxygen-containing functional groups (hydroxyls, epoxides, carboxyls, and carbonyls).22 By controlling the amount of oxygen functional groups via thermal annealing, Aksay et al. showed a peak PCE of 4.99% compared with 5.48% for the Pt cell.22
Recently, vertically oriented graphene (VG) has attracted growing research interest due to its large accessible surface area, high electrochemical activity, and attractive applications in energy storage.24–28 This study examines the use of VG as a CE of DSSCs. Based on our earlier research on VG, this material has many advantages over planar graphene, such as easy fabrication, porous structure with more accessible surface areas, and abundant surface oxygen functional groups.29–31 The catalytic activity of VG for the reduction of I3− is studied using electrochemical techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The VG electrode achieved a charge transfer resistance (RCT) of 7.3 × 10−3 Ω cm2versus 0.59 Ω cm2 for platinized FTO glass (Pt/FTO). To the best of our knowledge, this is the lowest RCT for I−/I3− redox couple of a DSSC CE.
The VG sheets were grown on stainless steel plates using a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process. Detailed experimental methods are available in the ESI.† Four different electrodes (VG-1, VG-2, VG-3, and VG-4) were grown with different moisture content by increasing the ratio of argon flow bubbled through water to pure/dry argon flow (1:9, 3:7, 6:4, and 10:0, respectively). The morphology and structure of VG grown on stainless steel plates were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. S1a,† the VG formed dome-like structures standing on a stainless steel plate. At an angle view, the height of the VG dome is estimated as about 2 μm. A close view reveals a great number of graphene sheets tightly and orderly packed together to form a highly branched structure (Fig. S1b†). Fig. 1a–d show cross-sectional SEM images of the VG electrodes. The water vapor concentration significantly affected the VG morphology. The VG-1 and VG-2 samples grown with a low water vapor concentration show a pillar-like structure with large spacing between pillars. A thin layer of amorphous carbon (a-C) can be observed at the bottom of VG-1 and VG-2 (Fig. 1a and b, see Fig. S2c and S3c† for high-magnification images). Increasing the water vapor concentration could lead to denser VG nanosheets. The VG-3 and VG-4 samples show little spacing between VG pillars (Fig. 1c and d) and no a-C is seen at the bottom (Fig. S4c and S5c†). However, VG-4 is even more densely packed and has smaller graphene platelets than VG-3 (Fig. S4 and S5†). It is noteworthy that the pore size of each VG can be maintained throughout the electrode (Fig. S2–S5†). The as-grown VG sheets were scraped off the stainless steel substrate and transferred to lacy carbon-coated copper grids for TEM analysis. As shown in Fig. 1e, graphene sheets that grew off the stainless steel surface appeared mostly transparent under e-beam illumination, suggesting their small thickness. The as-grown substrate-bound dense networks of few-layer graphene have an interlayer spacing of ∼0.35 nm, as shown in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1f). The TEM images reveal that VG sheets were strongly connected to the stainless steel surface via a carbon layer, which is similar to our previous work.25

(f) Graphene layers and stainless steel grain can be identified in the HRTEM image. 
The oxygen content in the VG electrodes was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Survey scans show the O1s and C1s peaks of the electrodes (Fig. 2a). The atomic ratio of oxygen to carbon (area of the O1s peak divided by the area of the C1s peak, multiplied by the ratio of the photoionization cross-sections) was calculated from the XPS survey spectra. All electrodes have a similar O/C ratio except VG-1 (Fig. 2c) in which the O1s peak is absent.

Raman spectroscopy shows strong D peaks for all electrodes indicating a high fraction of defects and open edges (Fig. 2b). The intensity ratio of D peak to G peak (graphitic carbon), I(D)/I(G), is introduced to compare the fraction of defects in the electrodes.

Fig. 2c shows that the VG-1 sample had the highest I(D)/I(G) while disordered carbon in other electrodes maintained at the same level. The 2D peak is a signature of graphitic carbon in graphene-like materials.32 A very small 2D′ band (approximately at 2900 cm−1) indicates the existence of the D′ band that is convoluted with the G band.
Our previous study revealed that the water vapor enhanced the VG growth by removing amorphous carbon.33 With a low concentration of water vapor (VG-1), much amorphous carbon is left on the VG surface as evidenced by the strong D peak in the Raman spectrum. Therefore, the absence of the O1s peak in the XPS spectrum for VG-1 is likely due to the amorphous carbon coverage. The decrease in I(D)/I(G) with increasing water vapor during the VG growth agrees well with the observation in ref. 33. The I(D)/I(G) values of VG-2, VG-3, and VG-4 follow well the trend of oxygen content (Fig. 2c). The SEM observation suggests that the growth rate of VG increases by adding more water (elimination of the spacing between VG pillars).
The catalytic performance of functionalized VG toward I3− was evaluated by using electrochemical methods. Fig. 3 presents the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characteristics of symmetrical dummy cells with I−/I3− electrolyte solution and two identical VG electrodes (see Fig. S6a† for the cell configuration). Electrocatalytic activity of our VG electrodes is characterized by EIS Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 3a and b. The experimental data can be fitted to an equivalent circuit in Fig. S6a† that was proposed by Grätzel et al.20

In general, the quality of a catalytic electrode is characterized by the charge transfer resistance, RCT, that scales inversely with the exchange current density, j0: (1)where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons, and F is the Faraday constant. Assuming a typical photocurrent density of a DSSC working under full sun illumination to be ca. 20 mA cm−2, eqn (1) provides an estimate of RCT = 1.3 Ω cm2 for the same current on the cathode side.20 The RCT of our Pt electrode is about 0.59 Ω cm2 according to the EIS, which is within the range of normally reported values (0.5–1.8 Ω cm2), depending strongly on the deposition methods.5,7,22,34
By fitting the EIS data, the RCT of all VG samples is listed in Table 1. Surprisingly, the RCT of VG-4 is only 7.3 × 10−3 Ω cm2, which is negligible. Aksay et al. suggested decreasing RCT of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with removal of oxygen functional groups.22 In our experiments, the ratio of O/C kept at a constant except VG-1. Assuming oxygen functional groups are the only active catalytic sites, a very possible reason for the decreasing RCT is the growing total surface area of VG electrodes. As presented earlier in the material synthesis section, the VG growth rate was enhanced by adding water vapor. The total amount of oxygen functional groups should be proportional to the material surface area. Therefore, VG electrodes with more water vapor during the synthesis should contain more oxygen functional groups. Moreover, the hierarchical structure of VG makes more active surface area accessible to the redox species. We note that the direct measurement of the surface area of VG electrodes is extremely difficult since the mass of VG on a single electrode is on the order of 10 μg. The surface area of an electrode will also be discussed in the following cyclic voltammetry discussions.

It is noteworthy that the frequency range of the mid-frequency semicircle (2.5k–25 Hz) agrees well with that of the reported RGO film, but the high-frequency semicircle (100–2.5 kHz) associated with the Nernst diffusion impedance in the porous electrode (ZW,pore) almost disappears for the VG electrode.22,35 Only when the RCT is extremely small can a slope at the high-frequency be observed, which is related to the ZW,pore (Fig. 3b). This implies that the redox species diffuse well in the hierarchical structure. Another advantage of the VG electrode is that the stainless steel substrate accounts for much lower RS than Pt/FTO, which can be evidenced in Fig. 3a (onset of the semicircles).
To distinguish between specific catalytic activity and surface area effects, we measured cyclic voltammograms for VG electrodes and Pt/FTO (Fig. 4). To resolve the peaks, the electrolyte concentration was diluted 10 times lower than that used in a DSSC. A blank stainless steel was measured first prior to VG samples. Scanning from −0.5 to 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, no redox peak can be observed for the bare stainless steel plate at all (curve SS in Fig. 4). Two pairs of peaks were observed for either VG electrodes or Pt/FTO.
 Fig. 4  Cyclic voltammograms obtained at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 for the oxidation and reduction of I2/I3− and I−/I3− redox couples using the as-grown VG on stainless steel plates as working electrodes. A Pt/FTO electrode was measured for comparison. A blank stainless steel (SS) electrode was also scanned for the background signal. The peak-to-peak separation (ΔEp) and reduction of I3− are indicated. 
The pair of peaks at low potential can be attributed to the redox reaction shown in reaction (2), and the pair at high potential can be attributed to the redox reaction shown in reaction (3).9,36 Since the counter electrode of a DSSC is responsible for catalysing the reduction of I3− to I−, the characteristics of peaks at low potential are at the focus of our analysis. I−3 + 2e− ⇌ 3I−(2) 3I2 + 2e− ⇌ 2I−3(3)
The peak current and the peak-to-peak separation (ΔEp) are two important parameters for comparing catalytic activities of different CEs. The increase in peak current densities of triiodide reduction (and also the capacitive background current) of VG electrodes suggests increasing active electrode surface area. The peak current densities of triiodide reduction (Jred) are compared for VG electrodes and Pt/FTO in Table 1. According to Nicholson, ΔEp varies inversely with the charge transfer rate (ks, electrochemical rate constant of a redox reaction) and a minimum ΔEp indicates the highest ks.37 The ΔEp of all samples is also listed in Table 1. The higher peak current density and lower ΔEp reveal that VG-3 and VG-4 are remarkable catalytic CEs for reduction of I3−, even better than the Pt electrode.
DFT calculations were carried out to elucidate the effect of oxygen functional groups. From the perspective of understanding the role of individual species, only two scenarios were taken into account in which graphene is solely oxidized by epoxide and hydroxyl groups while the carboxyl group is neglected due to its relatively low amount. Furthermore, given the fact that an I3− complex in a virtual system is composed of molecular I2 and ion I− together with the charge neutrality problem in a typical DFT calculation, molecular I2 was considered in the calculations here. Practically, decomposition of molecular I2 into two ions I− means the extraction of charge from the electrode and the induced bond elongation. Accordingly, the capability of each functional group can be gauged in these two respects.

Fig. 5 shows the contour plots of charge transfer upon the adsorption of molecular I2 to graphene oxidized with epoxy and hydroxyl group. It can be seen that the charge is mainly transferred from the functional group into the iodide molecule in both cases. Quantitative analysis of the charge transfer range (−0.031 e to +0.081 e for epoxy vs. −0.015 e to +0.022 e for hydroxyl, the negative and positive signs indicate charge depletion and accumulation, respectively) strongly reveals that the epoxy group is more capable of transferring electrons from the underlying graphene film. This can also be reflected from the bond length of the iodide molecule. In contrast to 2.51 Å for the pure graphene case, it increased to 2.56 Å and 2.54 Å for the cases with epoxy and hydroxyl groups, respectively. Further note that the oxygen atom in the epoxy is detached from one of the carbon atoms when the I2 molecule is approaching nearby as shown in Fig. 5a. The dangling bond suggests the enhanced charge donating nature than hydroxyl with charge accumulated between the oxygen atom and the I2 molecule. Hence, it is concluded that the functional groups work as the charge transfer channels.

The green and the purple color represent charge accumulation and depletion zone, respectively. 
Finally, the performances of DSSCs with our VG CEs and Pt/FTO CEs were tested for comparison. Fig. 6 and Table 1 show the corresponding data from current–voltage characteristics under simulated solar irradiation (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). The solar cell employing VG-4 reaches a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 5%. Other photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S1, ESI.† We note that the PCE has no apparent dependence on the CEs if the RCT of CEs is very low. With highly efficient CEs, the series resistance of a solar cell is dominated by the resistance of the photoanode, which is usually larger than the RCT. Although the PCE of our DSSCs with either the Pt CE or VG CE is only around 5% without deliberate optimization of the photoanodes, the comparison is fair because the influence of CEs on DSSC performance was observed based on photoanodes produced using exactly the same procedure. We tested a number of cells for each type of CEs, and the variations of PCE are given in Table 1. In this study, DSSCs with VG electrodes showed performance comparable with that of Pt electrodes. However, according to eqn (1), for even higher-efficiency (PCE > 20%) or concentrated DSSCs, the JSC will be dominated by the CEs. In that case, a lower-RCT CE sustaining high exchange current is more advantageous.

Conclusions
In summary, VG nanosheets have been successfully grown on stainless steel through a PECVD process and shown to efficiently act as catalytic counter electrodes in DSSCs. Increasing the water vapor concentration in the synthesis can decrease the charge transfer resistance of VG electrodes to as low as 1% of that of Pt electrodes. The enhanced catalytic performance can be attributed to a large accessible surface area, a hierarchical structure, and abundant oxygen functional groups of VG. DFT calculations reveal that the oxygen functional groups, especially epoxide groups, are crucial for the triiodide reduction. Through optimizing the VG CEs, a PCE of 5.36% has been achieved, which is higher than that of DSSCs with a Pt electrode (4.68%). Considering the facile approach, low contact resistance, and low cost, the VG has significant potential in large scale production of DSSCs. This finding paves a way for cheap and highly efficient counter electrodes in DSSCs.
