    , Accepted 17th March 2019First published on 18th March 2019AbstractHexagonal polypyrrole (PPy) nanosheets with highly ordered lateral orientation were developed by the generation and directed self-assembly of dopamine induced FeOOH–PPy heterostructures on nanoscale THF/water interfaces. The size-controlled nanosheets possess attractive photothermal conversion properties, which facilitate efficient photothermal inhibition of cancer cells.
Near-infrared (NIR) light-activated phototherapies, as represented by photothermal therapy (PTT) mediated by nanoscale photothermal conversion agents (PTCAs), provide a spatiotemporally controlled approach to cancer treatment with minimal invasion and high specificity.1 NIR-absorbing/conducting/semiconducting polymers, such as polypyrrole (PPy), polyaniline and polydopamine (PDA), have recently attracted immense attention because of their strong photothermal conversion and high biocompatibility as compared to their inorganic PTCA counterparts.2–4 More importantly, these aromatic polymers possess layered subunit structures consisting of rigid planar aggregates with a π-stacking spacing of around 3–4 Å.5,6
The structural properties of these polymers show great potential in constructing advanced 2D nanomaterials which can lead to increased relaxation energy and surface bond vibration by the confinement effect, and in turn, enhanced electron–phonon interaction to trigger photothermal effects.7,8 To date, space-confined synthesis by intercalation and directed polymerization in layered solid structures has emerged as a pioneering strategy to create thin PPy nanosheets with nanoscale lateral sizes.2,9 However, simple yet effective approaches toward uniform sizes remain elusive. Polymer chains can also be assembled into 2D structures at the air/liquid or liquid/liquid interface, but macroscale films were generally obtained owing to the largely continuous interfaces.10,11 In this context, we surmise that proper nanoscale interfaces (droplets/emulsions) with suitable sizes should be an ideal candidate for the generation of PPy nanosheets. Notably, it remains a great challenge to produce well-defined nanoplates/nanosheets on highly curved interfaces, unless additional driving forces such as colloidal self-assembly,10 heterogeneous hybridization,12 facet-selective growth,13etc. are applied, as widely used inorganic nanostructures can be installed horizontally (i.e., parallel to the interface).
Inspired by recent findings on the biomineralization of hydroxyl iron oxides (FeOOH) by PDA,14 we herein demonstrate a new simple strategy for fabricating PPy nanosheets through directed growth via inorganic/organic heterogeneous hybridization on liquid/liquid (THF/water) interfaces stabilized by a nonionic surfactant F127 (PEO106PPO70PEO106). Specifically, dopamine (DA) and pyrrole (Py) were solubilized in water and THF, respectively, followed by the addition of the oxidant (Fe3+) which induced the generation of FeOOH–PPy nanosheets (NS). The molar ratio of the reagents was 1 Py:0.017 DA:0.245 FeCl3:11.76 THF:595.7 H2O:0.0064 F127.
Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) (Fig. 1a) of the product indicated a hexagonal morphology of the nanosheets with an average diameter of about 1.5 μm. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping profiles, as shown in Fig. 1(b–e), revealed homogeneous distributions of C, N, O and Fe elements in hexagonal nanosheets. Therefore, the product was composed of hybrids of PPy and iron oxide, which is also supported by the FTIR spectra (Fig. S1, ESI†). Interestingly, a morphology evolution from nanoparticles to well-defined nanosheets was observed for the final products by raising the molar ratio of DA/Py from 0 to 0.017 (Fig. S2, ESI†). Further increasing the ratio led to nanosheets with a fuzzy periphery (0.019) or nanorods (0.023–0.045) (Fig. S2d–f, ESI†), revealing the important role of dopamine in the generation of the nanosheets.

To explore the formation kinetics of the nanosheets, TEM images at varying reaction intervals were used to monitor the change in morphology. In the first hour, a large number of heterostructured nanosheets (∼30–40 nm) nucleated (Fig. 1f), possibly as a consequence of preferred growth on the nanoscale THF/water interface (∼100 nm in size) (Fig. S3a, ESI†).15,16 The observed darker dots (∼3–5 nm) in the heterostructures should be ascribed to iron oxides, which is supported by the emergence of a typical absorption peak at 565 nm for the reaction solution (Fig. 1g). Interestingly, the peak was progressively red-shifted to 578 nm (24 h) after a small plateau in the peak evolution profile (Fig. 1h), implying a subsequent structural transformation. As expected, the primary nanostructures were attached to branched aggregates (at 6–9 h) (Fig. 1i and j). The intermediates began to pack more closely and transform into loose porous nanosheets with a hexagonal contour after 16 h (Fig. 1k–m), indicating self-assembly of the primary aggregates.17–19 Other parameters that were found critical in controlling the shape were the amounts of FeCl3 (catalyst for polymerization) (Fig. S3b, ESI†) and THF (whose evaporation may accelerate the self-assembly of the primary aggregates) (Fig. S3c, ESI†), as well as the temperature (PPy polymerization by Fe3+ is exothermic) (Fig. S3d, ESI†). All trials toward a faster formation rate cannot result in regular hexagonal nanosheets. Additionally, excessive F127 may lead to a stronger stabilization of the primary structure, which restricts the self-assembly and prevents the formation of hexagonal nanosheets (Fig. S4, ESI†).
The XRD pattern of PPy nanoparticles (PPy) synthesized in the absence of DA shows a typical broad peak between 20° and 30° (Fig. 2a). Unlike PPy, NS exhibits a remarkably sharp peak at 23.4° in the same region. The other diffraction peaks match a superposition of the standard patterns from the dominating δ-FeOOH (hexagonal phase, JCPDS card no. 77-0247) and additional α-FeOOH (orthorhombic phase, JCPDS no. 29-0713) lattice. In particular, the peak corresponding to the (001) facet (19.2°) of δ-FeOOH has a very high intensity, implying that the nanosheets contain a very high percentage of (001) facets.20 Detailed examination of the high-resolution TEM image of an individual sheet (Fig. 2b) suggests the presence of heterostructures. In all regions with a darker contrast, clear lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 2.55 Å and an interfacial angle of 60° were clearly observed, which should be attributed to the (010) and (100) planes of δ-FeOOH.21,22 This is also supported by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. S5, ESI†).
 Fig. 2  Structure characterizations of NS: XRD patterns (a); HRTEM image (b); Raman spectrum (c) and XPS spectrum (d), and schematic illustration of the proposed formation mechanism of NS (e). PPy nanomaterials (PPy) synthesized in the absence of dopamine were employed for comparison in (a) and (c). 
Characteristic peaks of PPy, i.e., the C–N vibration (1330 cm−1) and the symmetric CC stretching (1580 cm−1),23,24 are observed in the Raman spectra (Fig. 2c). Moreover, the distinct peaks of NS at 934 cm−1, 987 cm−1 and 1051 cm−1 could be attributed to doped bipolaron/polaron structures of PPy. The XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) spectrum (Fig. 2d) shows that Cl− ions were doped into the nanosheets at a doping level of ∼0.41 mol%, which is lower than PPy nanoparticles obtained by conventional Fe3+ ion catalyzed polymerization.25 The results are possibly associated with the possible heterogeneous oxidation by the embedded FeOOH nanocrystals.26 On the basis of the analysis above, the formation mechanism of NS is proposed and outlined in Fig. 2e. Ferric ion-induced polymerization of DA initiated the subsequent formation of abundant δ-FeOOH nanocrystals, which drove the hybridization and growth of PPy by the interfacial polymerization reaction. With the evaporation of THF, the primary FeOOH–PPy nanosheets self-assembled into heterostructured hexagonal nanosheets by possible multiple interactions such as π–π stacking, dipolar interactions and van der Waals attractions.18,27
In order to obtain smaller nanosheets that are more advantageous for biological applications, we explored the synthesis at higher temperatures to accelerate the THF-evaporation induced self-assembly. However, a mixture of nanosheets (∼500 nm) and agglomerates (100 nm) without a two dimensional morphology was obtained from the synthesis at 50 °C (Fig. S6a, ESI†), while sole agglomerates were observed at 60 °C (Fig. S6b, ESI†). Interestingly, smaller nanosheets with a regular hexagonal morphology and lateral size of around 450 nm (Fig. 3a and b and Fig. S7a, ESI†) were obtained at 40 °C. These small nanosheets possess good dispersion stability in physiological buffers (Fig. S7b, ESI†). Furthermore, the aqueous suspensions of NS presented a significant concentration-dependent (7–24 °C, at 20–100 μg mL−1, 0.5 W cm−2) and power-dependent (17.1–65 °C, at 0.5 to 2 W cm−2) temperature increase (Fig. 3d and e) after NIR irradiation. No obvious deterioration was observed after three cycles of temperature evolution by laser irradiation (Fig. 3f), highlighting good photothermal stability. The photothermal conversion efficiency (η) (Fig. 3g) and the extinction coefficient (ε) (Fig. S8a, ESI†) of NS were calculated to be 46.4% and 5.6 L g−1cm−1, which are remarkably larger than those of PPy nanoparticles (35% and 3.6 L g−1 cm−1) (Fig. S8 b–d, ESI†). Regarding that FeOOH nanomaterials have no absorption in the NIR region,28 the good photothermal properties should stem from the contributions of polypyrrole. The bandgap of NS was measured to be 0.91 eV (Fig. S9, ESI†), which is lower than that of PPy nanoparticles (1.17 eV). Considering the low doping ratio of Cl− ions compared to the reported PPy nanosheets by the space-confined synthesis,2 we believe that the low bandgap might be caused by other reasons. First, the intensity ratio of Raman peaks of the symmetric CC stretching mode to the skeletal band (1499 cm−1) was calculated to be 1.8, which is significantly higher than that of PPy synthesized in the absence of dopamine (1.3). This result indicates a larger coplanarity of the aromatic ring and π-conjugation length.23 Secondly, the average crystallite size of NS, obtained using the Scherrer equation at the characteristic XRD peak (23.4°) of PPy, was calculated to be ∼16 Å, which is much larger than previous studies on pure PPy nanoparticles (6.3–7.8 Å).29 This indicates quite a high degree of PPy orientation and ordering with periodic interplane spacings (3.8 Å).23,27 Altogether, the high photothermal conversion efficiency is related to the coplanarity caused by the highly ordered packing of the π-conjugated rings.30

In photothermal therapy, actions of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) result in an increase in the tolerance of the cells to thermal injury. The employment of HSP70 inhibitors (for instance, 2-phenylethynesulfonamide (PES)) could improve the therapy efficiency.1 Benefiting from the large surface area of NS and favorable π–π stacking interactions on PPy,31 a high PES loading capacity (992 μg mg−1) was obtained for these small-sized NS (Fig. 3h). Additionally, the premature PES release can be efficiently prohibited under neutral pH conditions, while acidic pH (5.5) can serve as a trigger to stimulate continuous drug release (Fig. S7, ESI†).
The in vitro toxicities of NS to a model drug-resistant cell line (MCF-7/ADR cells) were quantified by cell viabilities from a standard CCK-8 assay. A good biocompatibility of NS at concentrations up to 200 μg mL−1 was observed (Fig. 4a). Afterwards, NS was labeled with a membrane-impermeable dye (i.e., calcein) to evaluate the cellular uptake (Fig. 4b).32 The strong green signals inside cells implied the efficient internalization of the nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 4c, the MCF-7/ADR cells treated with laser irradiation alone (NIR) displayed a much higher HSP70 expression than those without any treatment (control), owing to the strong heat stress response of the drug resistant cancer cells. In contrast, the HSP70 level was significantly down-regulated for cells treated with PES loaded nanosheets (24 h) and subsequent laser irradiation (0.5 W cm−2, 10 min). A concentration dependent decrease of the cell viability to 52% was observed for cells incubated with free nanosheets (0–100 μg mL−1) and NIR irradiation (Fig. 4d). Notably, NS induced PES delivery significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity (∼15% at 100 μg mL−1). CLSM images of cells by calcein-AM/PI double staining also intuitively evidenced that a combination of HSP70 inhibitor delivery and photothermal ablation can generate high efficiency in destroying cancer cells (Fig. 4e–h). Considering the large size of NS, it is speculated that future work on controlling the growth of nanosheets would generate new breakthroughs in terms of improved intracellular uptake and photothermal therapy.

In summary, this study showed that nanoscale liquid–liquid interfaces and FeOOH nanocrystals can drive and direct the polymerization and hybridization of FeOOH–PPy nanosheets in a simple synthesis. The heterostructured nanosheets possess great potential for photothermal therapy.
