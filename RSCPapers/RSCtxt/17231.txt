    , Accepted 23rd May 2019First published on 23rd May 2019AbstractVisible-light driven photocatalytic hydrogen production from water is a hotspot in renewable energy. Recent experiments have proved that 2D/2D SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions exhibit greatly improved photocatalytic activities; still lacking is a fundamental understanding of the complex mechanism as well as rationally designed schemes for highly-effective SiC/g-C3N4 photocatalysts. Using state-of-the-art hybrid density functional theory, we uncover as many as 7 advantageous factors in SiC/g-C3N4 layered photocatalysts: (1) severe bending of g-C3N4, (2) formation of type-II heterojunctions, (3) ideal bandgap widths around 2.0 eV, (4) intimate interface contact and strong interfacial interactions, (5) considerable built-in electric field, (6) suitable band edge positions, and (7) near-zero Gibbs free-energy (ΔGH*). This theoretical work not only offers a comprehensive insight into the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for 2D/2D SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions, but also provides rational strategies for designing highly-effective SiC/g-C3N4 photocatalysts in producing hydrogen.
1 Introduction
Theoretically, visible-light-driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution over a semiconductor photocatalyst could be extremely economical and environmentally friendly in harvesting and storing solar energy, which was first experimentally realized on TiO2 electrodes in 1972.1 Over the past decades, numerous efforts have been devoted to exploring more effective alternatives with high chemical stability in splitting water into hydrogen, while rarely have such photocatalysts been extended to practical applications, since these metallic photocatalysts based on metal–H bond interactions are easily corroded and hardly activated during photocatalytic reactions.2 Therefore, developing non-metal and low-cost materials with stable photo-activity to substitute metallic photocatalysts becomes a hot trend in the field of energy conversion and storage.3,4 Since graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was proved to be capable of splitting water under visible light,5 metal-free photocatalysts thus attracted intensive attention in producing hydrogen.6–8
Metal-free layered g-C3N4 has exhibited tremendous application potential as an attractive photocatalyst for water splitting, due to its earth abundance, suitable band positions, unique advantages of easy fabrication of a variety of nanostructures, and strong tolerance to acid/alkaline environments.9,10 Nevertheless, raw g-C3N4 still suffers from several shortcomings, including insufficient visible light harvesting, moderate oxidation ability, and particularly, low photogenerated charge carrier separation efficiency, which are generally known as the current major bottle-neck in the photocatalytic application of single-component photocatalysts.11–13 Accordingly, designing highly-effective g-C3N4-based metal-free photocatalysts with better separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs is of great significance. Very recently, 2D/2D nanocomposites have drawn extensive attention. As compared with 0D/2D and 1D/2D nanocomposites, 2D/2D nanostructures could enlarge the contact area of the interface region, which contributes to accelerating the charge mobility and lowering photogenerated charge carrier recombination rates in photocatalytic systems.14–17 Constructing 2D/2D g-C3N4-based heterostructures can not only retard the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, but also substantially improve some physical properties due to the synergistic effects between the two components.8,18,19
Silicon carbide (SiC), as one of the most important metal-free semiconductors, has demonstrated many exceptional features, such as high saturated carrier mobility, high strength, and good chemical inertness,20–22 which make SiC recognized as an ideal candidate for composites and heterogeneous catalyst supports.23,24 With low dimensionality, quantum confinement and shape effects, the large surface of nanocrystalline SiC can reduce the activation barrier for dissociating water molecules, resulting in superior photocatalytic activity for SiC nanosheets.25–28 Furthermore, recent progress in synthesizing ultrathin layered 2D-SiC29–31 down to a monolayer makes it also a valuable carbonaceous material in both fundamental research and practical applications. In particular, 2D/2D SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunction nanocomposites have recently been prepared by several groups,32–35 and the obviously enhanced photocatalytic ability has been confirmed. To the best of our knowledge, however, in-depth theoretical investigations on exploring the complex factors responsible for the improved photocatalytic ability are still lacking. Meanwhile, by revealing the complicated mechanism behind the promoted photocatalytic H2 evolution efficiency, highly-effective 2D/2D SiC/g-C3N4 metal-free photocatalysts could be rationally designed.
With the aforementioned considerations in mind, we performed a first-principles study to verify and reveal the complex reasons for the enhanced photocatalytic performance of 2D/2D SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions with different layer numbers and stacking sequences. Firstly, by calculating the significantly extended and enhanced UV-vis absorption spectra with the state-of-the-art TDHF-HSE06 method, we confirm the promoted photocatalytic performance of SiC/g-C3N4 nanocomposites. Subsequently, through exploring the geometrical, electronic, optical, and interfacial properties, as well as the photocatalytic activities in overall water splitting, we conclude as many as 7 reasons to explain the improved photocatalytic activities in SiC/g-C3N4 heterostructures. Finally, by comparing three different SiC/g-C3N4 layered heterojunctions, we find that the SiC/g-C3N4 multilayers obviously demonstrate better photocatalytic performance than the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer from an overall perspective, which may provide rational design strategies for SiC/g-C3N4-based metal-free photocatalysts.
2 Method and models
Our first-principles calculations were based on the density functional theory (DFT) in conjunction with the projector-augmented-wave (PAW) potential as implemented by the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). Since accurate description of long-range interactions is missing in common DFT methods, the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the approach of Grimme (DFT-D2)36 was adopted to correct the weak van der Waals (vdW) like interaction. The cutoff energy of the plane-wave basis set was chosen to be 500 eV. The Brillouin-zone integration was performed with a Monkhorst–Pack grid of 15 × 15 × 1. All SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions were fully relaxed until the force was down to 0.001 eV Å−1, and the criterion for the total energy was 10−8 eV. A vacuum space beyond 15 Å along the z direction was used to decouple possible periodic interactions. Visualizations of supercells and structures were plotted with VESTA software.37
Since the PBE functional and GGA approach usually underestimate the energy gap of a semiconductor,38 the screened hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof 2006 (HSE06) functional39 has been employed to acquire accurate electronic structures and optical properties. Our previous studies40,41 have already proved that the band gap value of g-C3N4 calculated using HSE06 is in excellent agreement with experiments.42–44 A recent study45 has just calculated the band structure of graphitic SiC monolayers also using the more accurate but computationally expensive HSE06 and obtained an indirect bandgap of 3.38 eV, and the samples run for reference systems such as 3C-SiC and 4H-SiC yielded energy gap widths of 2.145 and 3.131 eV, respectively, which agreed extremely well with experimental measurements (2.2 and 3.27 eV). In addition, our calculated energy gaps of g-C3N4 and SiC monolayers are 2.74 eV and 3.16 eV, respectively, both within reasonable ranges,5,46 indicating that our calculations are accurate enough to proceed for further study, especially for the electronic structures and optical absorption spectra of SiC/g-C3N4 layered heterostructures.
Taking excitonic effects into consideration, the frequency-dependent dielectric matrices were estimated using the time-dependent Hartree–Fock approach (TDHF) on top of the HSE06 hybrid functional calculations.47 To calculate spectra beyond the independent particle approximation and beyond RPA, the flag ALGO was set to ALGO = TDHF. In addition, the accurate spectra can also be calculated using model-BSE, which uses a parametrized model for dielectric screening.48 Accordingly, the absorption coefficients were deduced from the dielectric functions:49 (1)where the real part ε1(ω) was obtained based on the usual Kramers–Kronig transformation,50,51 while the imaginary part of the dielectric function ε2(ω) was derived by summation over empty states. Eventually, all parameters of the absorption spectra and related optical properties could be determined.
Two different condensation states usually have been demonstrated as the primary building blocks for 2D g-C3N4 networks: s-triazine units with a periodic array of single carbon vacancies and tri-s-triazine/heptazine subunits with larger periodic vacancies in the lattice.52 To strike a good balance between the computational expense and accuracy, the s-triazine rings are chosen as our building units for the g-C3N4 monolayer, which will be discussed in detail later. As tabulated in Table 1, the fully-relaxed lattice parameters of single-layered g-C3N4 and SiC are 4.780 and 3.091 Å, respectively, which are in line with other work.53–56 To simulate the SiC/g-C3N4 layered nanocomposite, we propose the following models, in which a 2 × 2 supercell of the g-C3N4 monolayer (see Fig. 1a) is built to match a 3 × 3 cell of SiC sheets (see Fig. 1c), with small lattice mismatches less than 2%. Herein, we have considered three different types of SiC/g-C3N4 hybrids, including a SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer, SiC/g-C3N4/SiC sandwich structure, and SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 trilayer. In the g-C3N4 monolayer, due to the different chemical environments, nitrogen atoms can be classified into two kinds (N1 and N2), and all carbon atoms share three nearest-neighboring nitrogen atoms,57 as plotted in Fig. 1a. Among them, N1 atoms are fully saturated by their surrounding C atoms, while N2 only connects two C atoms, leaving a non-bonding character.58

3 Results and discussion
3.1 Isolated two components
Before exploring the SiC/g-C3N4 nanocomposites, we firstly examined the isolated g-C3N4 and SiC monolayers. The geometrical and electronic structures of single-layered g-C3N4 and SiC are illustrated in Fig. 1a–d. In the 2 × 2 g-C3N4 supercell, there are a total of 12 C atoms, 4 N1 atoms, and 12 N2 atoms, denoted by brown, pink and grey spheres, respectively. Meanwhile, a 3 × 3 SiC cell contains a total of 9 C and 9 Si atoms, represented by brown and blue spheres, respectively. To be more reliable, we have considered the Brillouin zone folding effects of g-C3N4 and SiC supercells on their electronic structure. Fig. 1 and S1† both clearly show that the g-C3N4 monolayer has a direct energy gap of 2.74 eV and the SiC monolayer exhibits an indirect band gap of 3.16 eV, whose valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are dominated by N(Si) and C atoms, respectively, irrespective of the size of their supercells. The main difference is that the Brillouin zone folding effects shift the VBM of the SiC monolayer to the Γ point from the initial K point, but it won't affect our results obtained from the corresponding electronic structures.
The projected density of states (PDOS) of g-C3N4 and SiC monolayers is plotted in Fig. 1e, from which we can see that the VBM and CBM of the g-C3N4 monolayer are mainly contributed by N2 and C atoms, respectively, implying the important role of unsaturated N2 atoms in determining the electronic properties of g-C3N4-based layers. The above results deduced from the PDOS are in line with those of the corresponding band structures. To assess the optical performance of single-layered g-C3N4 and SiC, we have calculated their absorption coefficients with DFT/TDHF methods (excluding/including the excitonic effect) using the accurate HSE06 functional. The absorption spectra deduced from the TDHF-HSE06 approach are slightly stronger than those from the DFT-HSE06 method, suggesting that excitonic effects will promote the absorption strength to some extent. By comparing the absorption spectra and band gap widths of g-C3N4 and SiC monolayers, we can preliminarily draw the conclusions that the g-C3N4 monolayer has a wider optical absorption range, while the SiC monolayer has a much higher visible-light absorption coefficient overall. Now a question arises as to whether the insufficient visible-light absorption issue of the g-C3N4 monolayer will be resolved by combining it with SiC nanosheets. Consequently, we turn to investigate the 2D/2D SiC/g-C3N4 vdW heterojunctions.
3.2 Structural stabilities
Heterojunctions linked with weak vdW forces are typically fabricated by mechanical exfoliation and subsequent attachment, so the orientation can't be controlled strictly.56 For the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer, there are four most likely stacking configurations with various atom-alignment types, whose top and side views after full relaxation are illustrated in Fig. S2.† To evaluate their thermodynamic stability, the adhesive energies (Ead) are calculated as Ead = Etotal − ESiC − Eg-C3N4(2)where Etotal, ESiC, and Eg-C3N4 are the energies of the whole vdW heterojunction, SiC layers and g-C3N4 monolayer, respectively. According to this definition, the nanocomposite with a negative Ead is energetically favorable and can be fabricated easily, and a more negative value of Ead means a more stable system with more intimate interface binding. The Ead, interlayer spacing, and buckling height of g-C3N4 for the four stacking SiC/g-C3N4 patterns are given in Fig. S2.†
Clearly, the leftmost configuration in Fig. S2† is the most thermodynamically stable system, owing to the smallest value of Ead (−2.079 eV) as well as the maximum bending (1.201 Å) for g-C3N4. The isolated g-C3N4 monolayer is a perfectly planar sheet, while the strong interfacial interactions in the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer make the g-C3N4 significantly buckled. Therefore, a stronger bend basically equals a more intimate contact between the two components. Besides, from the interlayer spacing (at least 2.863 Å) we can conclude that all the configurations are vdW heterostructures with a typical vdW equilibrium distance. Among them, the leftmost (2.865 Å) and rightmost (2.863 Å) configurations share approximate and the shortest interlayer spacings, which further prove the intimate binding between the two individuals in the leftmost system. With the above considerations in mind, we unquestionably take the leftmost configuration (see Fig. S2† and 2a) as the only representative of the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer.
 Fig. 2  Top (upper panel) and side (lower panel) views of the optimized structures of (a) the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer, (b) SiC/g-C3N4/SiC sandwich structure, and (c) SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 trilayer. The interlayer spacing (along the z axis) between the two individuals, the buckling height of the g-C3N4 monolayer, and the adhesive energies of the three heterojunctions are calculated and given. 
For SiC/g-C3N4/SiC sandwich structures, there are also four stacking patterns, as shown in Fig. S4.† Undoubtedly, the leftmost configuration in Fig. S4† is the most favorable structure of SiC/g-C3N4/SiC heterojunctions, with the most negative value of Ead (−3.221 eV), the largest buckling height of the g-C3N4 monolayer (1.159 Å), and the shortest vertical separation between the two components (2.840 and 2.856 Å). Thus, the leftmost configuration (see Fig. S4† and 2b) is taken as the representative for the SiC/g-C3N4/SiC sandwich structure. To efficiently select the most stable pattern in the SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 trilayer, we directly construct the three stacking arrangements (labeled A, B, and C, see Fig. S5†) of the SiC bilayer and rapidly confirm the most stable configuration (A), due to the smallest Ead (−0.240 eV) and the nearest interlayer distance (3.230 Å), which are fully consistent with an earlier report.59 Additionally, the state-of-the-art HSE06 calculations demonstrate that the SiC bilayer exhibits an indirect band gap of 2.58 eV, which is much narrower than that of the SiC monolayer and may exhibit more efficient visible-light absorption spectra. Then, based on the same atom-alignment type in the representative SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer (see Fig. 2a), the most favorable configuration of the SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 trilayer is constructed by combining the SiC bilayer with the g-C3N4 monolayer, as shown in Fig. 2c, with an Ead of −4.072 eV, a buckling height of 1.199 Å in g-C3N4, and interlayer distances of 2.809 (between g-C3N4 and SiC) and 3.325 Å (between two SiC monolayers). In the following sections, only the most stable configurations of the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer, SiC/g-C3N4/SiC sandwich structure, and SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 trilayer are investigated, as plotted in Fig. 2.
3.3 Geometrical structures
Both the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer and trilayer have been explored in this work, and there are two reasons to study the trilayer structures. On the one hand, our previous work60 has demonstrated that the interlayer coupling in 2D few-layered vdW heterostructures can be tuned by varying the number of layers. Compared to that in the bilayer, the interlayer coupling between neighboring layers in trilayer vdW heterostructures can be dramatically enhanced by stacking a third layer, which could result in enhanced electronic properties and photocatalytic performance for multilayer heterojunctions. On the other hand, the recently experimentally fabricated SiC/g-C3N4 layered heterojunctions32–35 are more likely to be a coexistence of the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer and multilayer, so it's essential to study the trilayer as a representative of the SiC/g-C3N4 multilayer.
If we look carefully into the g-C3N4 monolayer of all the stacking patterns in Fig. 2, S2, and S4,† we should note that the atoms on the g-C3N4 monolayer closest to the SiC sheet, with no exception, are all N2 atoms, which implies the crucial role of N2 atoms in strengthening the interfacial forces in SiC/g-C3N4 hybrids. Then, we plot the PDOS of the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer as an example to further investigate the reasons behind the strong interlayer interactions and high bending of the g-C3N4 monolayer, as shown in Fig. 3d. In the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer, the valence band edges of g-C3N4 and the conduction band edges of SiC are largely dominated by N2 and Si atoms, suggesting the hybridization interactions between the two kinds of atoms. Here, let's look back into the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer in Fig. 2a, it's clear that the middle N2 atoms in g-C3N4 match a vertical alignment with Si atoms on SiC, further confirming the hybridization interactions between N2 and Si atoms. This is exactly the reason that produces the intimate interface contact and causes the severe bending of the g-C3N4 monolayer in 2D/2D SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions.

The red circles, green squares, and blue diamonds stand for the projection of g-C3N4, SiC (SiC-top, SiC-1), and SiC-bottom (SiC-2), respectively. (d) PDOS of g-C3N4 (upper panel) and SiC (lower panel) in the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer. (e) The absorption spectra of SiC/g-C3N4, SiC/g-C3N4/SiC, and SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 heterostructures with DFT and TDHF methods. 
The strong interfacial force and intimate binding between g-C3N4 and SiC should be responsible for the significant buckling of SiC/g-C3N4 layered heterojunctions. As shown in Fig. 2, S2, and S4,† the atoms on the g-C3N4 monolayer closest to the SiC sheet, with no exception, are all N2 atoms. It's known that N2 atoms in g-C3N4 only connect two C atoms and consequently leave a non-bonding character, which tend to interact with other atoms to obtain electrons. As shown in Fig. 3d and S5,† the N2 atoms demonstrate a strong hybridization with the SiC sheet. This point has further been proved by the Bader charge analysis, the N2 atoms in the three SiC/g-C3N4 heterostructures gain 1.175, 1.183, and 1.179 electrons, and 0.097, 0.107, and 0.201 electrons have been transferred from SiC to g-C3N4, respectively. Besides, the 3D charge density difference, as shown in Fig. 4, also shows the strong interfacial interactions and the intimate binding between the two components. What's more, the charge transfer in SiC/g-C3N4 trilayers (SiC/g-C3N4/SiC and SiC/SiC/g-C3N4) is much stronger than that in the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer.

(d) The profile of the planar averaged charge density difference for the above three configurations as a function of position in the z-direction. The horizontal dashed dotted lines denote the central location of each atomic layer. The positive and negative values of ρ denote electron depletion and accumulation, respectively. 
For the cases of SiC/g-C3N4/SiC and SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 heterostructures, as shown in Fig. 2 and S5,† the same conclusions can be reached. Importantly, a previous study61 has claimed that dynamic strain could improve the binding energy of hydrogen for g-C3N4 sheets, potentially resulting in better hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of g-C3N4-based layered materials. Even weak compressive or tensile strain will significantly enhance their photocatalytic activities. As a result, the severe bending in the three SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions means that a strong strain is applied on the g-C3N4 monolayer, which contributes a lot to the promotion of the photocatalytic performance of SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions. In brief, the high buckling height of g-C3N4 caused by N2 and Si atoms is the first factor that improves the photocatalytic performance of SiC/g-C3N4 hybrids.
3.4 Electronic and optical properties
Next, we investigate the electronic properties of the above three SiC/g-C3N4 vdW heterojunctions. From Fig. 3a–c we can obtain two crucial and advantageous features for SiC/g-C3N4 photocatalysts: (1) the three heterojunctions are all type-II heterojunctions, (2) the designed three types of SiC/g-C3N4 hybrids have well-suited energy gap widths (∼2 eV). In general, constructing a suitable heterojunction, such as a type II heterostructure, is recognized as the most feasible strategy for promoting the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, which greatly enhances the photocatalytic ability.62,63 As plotted in Fig. 3a–d, it can be seen that the VBM and CBM of the three systems are respectively dominated by the SiC sheet and g-C3N4 monolayer, which makes them typical type-II heterojunctions. To further prove the above results, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the three heterostructures are also given in Fig. S7.† Obviously, their HOMO and LUMO completely stem from SiC and g-C3N4 monolayers, respectively, which reveal that the electron transition in these systems will take place between different components and layers. This characteristic greatly facilitates the effective separation and effectively enhances their charge extraction efficiency.63
It's known that the ideal band gap of a semiconductor photocatalyst should be ∼2.0 eV, which could capture a variety of visible light to generate sufficient electrons and holes with strong driving forces for the photocatalytic redox reaction.64,65 The wide bandgap of g-C3N4 beyond 2.7 eV makes it merely harvest the solar light with a wavelength below 460 nm. However, by constructing SiC/g-C3N4 vdW heterojunctions, the three g-C3N4-based metal-free layers demonstrate ideal band gaps around 2 eV (2.03, 2.10 and 1.91 eV), with a much wider visible-light absorption range up to 600 nm. In order to confirm the enhanced visible-light absorption, the absorption coefficients of the above three systems have been calculated with the DFT and TDHF methods using the state-of-the-art HSE06 functional, as shown in Fig. 3e. The calculated absorption spectrum (see the inset in Fig. 1f) of g-C3N4 with TDHF methods in this paper is very similar to that of the experimental results.5 The calculated and experimental absorption spectra demonstrate an extremely approximate optical absorption range, which suggests that our spectra calculations are accurate and reliable.
Remarkably, the three systems all demonstrate much more sensible absorption spectra than the isolated individuals (see Fig. 1f), within the whole calculated ultraviolet and visible light ranges (UV-vis, 200–600 nm), and their visible-light absorption width has been largely extended (beyond 600 nm) relative to the pristine g-C3N4 monolayer. Moreover, among the three systems, the SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 trilayer shows the highest visible-light absorption coefficients on the whole, which provides a rational scheme for designing highly-effective SiC/g-C3N4 photocatalysts. Besides, to consider the exciton effect in these SiC/g-C3N4 layered heterojunctions, we have estimated the exciton binding energy, inferred from the difference between the HSE06 band gaps and the HSE06-TDHF optical gaps. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3e, according to the optical band gap values, we deduced the exciton binding energies of the three types of SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions (see Fig. 2a–c), with values of 0.31 eV, 0.44 eV, and 0.08 eV, respectively. Such small exciton binding energy facilitates the splitting of excitons into free charge carriers, which suggests that these semiconducting SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions could demonstrate excellent energy conversion efficiency under solar light irradiation.
Here, there is an important point we should notice. Is the s-triazine-based g-C3N4 reliable to be designed as the model in this work? Generally, two different condensation states have been demonstrated as the primary building blocks in a single layer of g-C3N4 networks: s-triazine units and tri-s-triazine-based g-C3N4. It has been experimentally and theoretically demonstrated that the energetically favored tri-s-triazine-based g-C3N4 is more stable than the s-triazine unit. Therefore, we add the HSE06 hybrid calculations of SiC/g-C3N4 based on the tri-s-triazine unit, as shown in Fig. S3.† To construct the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer, a 3 × 3 supercell of the tri-s-triazine-based g-C3N4 monolayer is built to match a 7 × 7 cell of the SiC monolayer. Like s-triazine g-C3N4, the tri-s-triazine g-C3N4 also exhibits approximate interface spacing and buckling height, with values of 2.865 and 1.213 Å, respectively. Meanwhile, the two units also have extremely similar electronic structures, such as the energy gap around 2 eV, type-II heterojunctions, and strong hybridization between g-C3N4 and SiC components. Based on the above results, we can conclude that the two units are very likely to obtain the same results and mechanism for these SiC/g-C3N4 layered photocatalysts. In brief, to strike a good balance between the computational expense and accuracy, the s-triazine rings are chosen as our building units for the g-C3N4 monolayer.
3.5 Interfacial properties
To explore the detailed interlayer interactions and gain an insight into the origins of the promoted photocatalytic performance in SiC/g-C3N4 heterostructures, their planar-averaged charge density difference along the z-direction and the corresponding quantitative results of charge redistribution are calculated, as depicted in Fig. 4. We visualized the three-dimensional (3D) charge density difference by subtracting the electron charge of SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions from that of the free g-C3N4 monolayer and SiC sheet. Herein the 3D charge density difference (Δρ) is defined below Δρ = ρSiC/g-C3N4 − ρSiC − ρg-C3N4(3)where ρSiC/g-C3N4, ρSiC, and ρg-C3N4 represent the charge densities of the SiC/g-C3N4 nanocomposites, SiC nanosheet, and g-C3N4 monolayer in the same system, respectively. The purple and green colors denote the charge accumulation and depletion, respectively. It's clear that the charge redistribution mainly appears around the interface region, which also reflects the strong interactions near the interface and the intimate binding between the two components. Obviously, the interface charge depletion can be regarded as direct evidence caused by the interfacial electric field, and this polarized field near the interface is beneficial to prevent the recombination of photogenerated carriers. The quantitative results of interfacial charge transfer can be seen in Fig. 4d, which demonstrates an accurate and comparative profile for the three SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions. The positive and negative values of ρ denote electron depletion and accumulation, respectively. Clearly, the charge transfer in the SiC/g-C3N4 multilayers (SiC/g-C3N4/SiC and SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 trilayers) is much stronger than that in the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer, thus revealing the stronger interfacial forces and more intimate contact between the two individuals. Moreover, the SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 trilayer exhibits the strongest charge transfer in the three nanocomposites, so this configuration is very likely to be the most promising pattern as SiC/g-C3N4 photocatalysts, with intimate binding and a considerable built-in electric field.
Meanwhile, there is somewhat a charge transfer from the SiC to the g-C3N4, and the interfacial charge transfer might lead to polarization as well as the formation of a built-in electric field at the interface. From Fig. 4a we can see that, in the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer, many electrons gather together around the N2 atoms that align with Si atoms, and the situations in SiC/g-C3N4/SiC and SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 are also similar. Further charge analysis based on the Bader method shows that N2 atoms in all gain 1.175, 1.183, and 1.179 electrons, and 0.097, 0.107, and 0.201 electrons have been transferred from SiC to g-C3N4 in the three heterojunctions, respectively. Further evidence supports that the enhanced photocatalytic activities for SiC/g-C3N4 nanocomposites are acquired by analyzing the electrostatic potential distribution. The planar averaged electrostatic potentials across the interface of these junctions and the corresponding monolayers are plotted in Fig. 5. The electrostatic potential for the three systems basically remains the same regardless of the stacking types of SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions. The considerable difference in the ionization potential of g-C3N4 with respect to SiC also implies the high possibility of type-II band alignment in their heterojunctions. The macroscopic average electrostatic potential of single-layered g-C3N4 is 3.23 eV higher than that of the SiC monolayer. On the one hand, this large potential drop in these heterojunctions indicates a strong electrostatic field across the interface between the two individuals, driving electron transfer from the SiC to the g-C3N4 layers.66 On the other hand, the large potential step that acts as a transport barrier between adjacent layers is anticipated to greatly alter the charge transport and optical properties of 2D stacked layered heterojunctions.60 Above all, the existence of this built-in electric field between the two individuals is favorable for preventing the rapid recombination of photoexcited charge carriers in g-C3N4-based photocatalysts. The bottom panel of Fig. 5 visually demonstrates that the Si atoms in SiC layers and the N atoms in g-C3N4 exhibit the highest and lowest potential, so the electrons tend to migrate from SiC to g-C3N4 layers. As a result, the unsaturated N2 atoms, the large potential drop, and the intimate interface contact contribute to accelerating charge transfer between the two individuals, and the considerable built-in electric field at the interface can prevent the recombination of transferred charge carriers, which may overcome the current major challenge for g-C3N4 single-component photocatalysts.

The top panel exhibits a profile of the planar averaged self-consistent electrostatic potential for the SiC/g-C3N4, SiC/g-C3N4/SiC, and SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 vdW heterostructures as a function of position in the z direction. For comparison, the positions are aligned with the central location of the single-layered SiC on top of g-C3N4. As a visual guide, the charge in interlayer separation in the above systems is denoted by distinguishing the central location of g-C3N4 and SiC monolayers. The bottom panel demonstrates the visual electrostatic potential of the SiC/g-C3N4/SiC sandwich structure (half of the calculated supercell). 
3.6 Photocatalytic activities in producing hydrogen
In fact, to be an eligible photocatalyst in splitting water to produce hydrogen, these heterojunctions have to exhibit appropriate band-gap positions that straddle the redox potentials of water splitting with a conduction band more negative than the reduction potential for producing H2 (0 eV at pH = 0, −0.41 eV at pH = 7) and a valence band more positive than the oxidation potential for O2 generation (1.23 eV at pH = 0, 0.82 eV at pH = 7). The band edge potentials of the three SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions at pH = 0 and 7 (vs. NHE) are shown in Fig. 6. It's easy to see that all the three heterojunctions can be utilized to split water in acid and neutral environments (pH = 0–7). More importantly, the delicate balance between the reduction reaction and oxidation reaction is another crucial condition for photocatalysts in overall water splitting.67 That's to say, the reduction reaction and the oxidization reaction should proceed simultaneously in a relatively synchronized pace. Even a small difference between the reducing power (RP) and oxidizing power (OP) can obviously inhibit the progress of the overall redox reaction. RP (OP) means the difference between the proton (oxygen) reduction and the CBM (VBM) edge potentials. The equalization of the RP and OP can simultaneously accelerate the speed of the reduction and oxidation reactions, which will further improve the photo-catalytic efficiency. By calculating the accurate band edge positions we can observe that the RP and OP of the SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 trilayer keeps the best balance at pH = 0, with the magnitudes of 0.12 and 0.19 eV, respectively. Meanwhile, the RP and OP of the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer also strike an excellent balance at pH = 7, with values of 0.35 and 0.45 eV. For comparison, the RP and OP of isolated g-C3N4 are 1.12 and 0.39 eV at pH = 0 (0.71 and 0.80 eV at pH = 7), respectively. Besides, with the pH value increasing from 0 to 7, all the SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions can strike an accurate balance between the RP and OP (RP = OP) at a critical point, while the free g-C3N4 monolayer can't achieve this ideal balance at any pH. Thus, the SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions can exhibit much better photocatalytic activities than their components in integral acid and neutral environments. This is also a factor which may contribute to enhancing the photocatalytic activities for SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions, relative to the freestanding g-C3N4 monolayer.
 Fig. 6  Calculated band edge potentials versus normal hydrogen electrodes of SiC, g-C3N4, SiC/g-C3N4, SiC/g-C3N4/SiC, and SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 layers at pH = 0 and 7. The carrier transfer and separation in the three heterojunctions are displayed. 
Eventually, the overall HER mechanism for these SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions can be evaluated with a three-state diagram comprising an initial state H+ + e−, an intermediate adsorbed H*, and a final product 1/2H2, as shown in Fig. 7. The Gibbs free-energy of the intermediate state ΔGH* has been proven to be a major descriptor to characterize the HER activity for a wide variety of catalysts.68 Catalysts with positive values give rise to low kinetics of adsorption of hydrogen, while catalysts with negative values result in low kinetics of release of hydrogen molecules.9,69 Therefore, the optimal value of |ΔGH*| should be zero or near-zero. Herein, the ΔGH* of the pure g-C3N4 monolayer is calculated to be −0.33 eV, which is completely the same as in recent work.70 This large negative ΔGH* for raw g-C3N4 suggests that the chemical adsorption of H* on its surface is too strong, hence weakening its HER ability. However, in the three SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions, the |ΔGH*| can be reduced to 0.10, 0.08 and 0.01 eV, respectively. There are different adsorption sites of H atoms on g-C3N4, and the most stable position is the priority to be considered.71 A previous study9 has proved that the most stable H* adsorption pattern is located on N2, and this work also selects this site to calculate the Gibbs free-energy. In particular, the |ΔGH*| for the SiC/g-C3N4/SiC sandwich structure has a near-zero value of 0.01 eV, which is even better than the well-known highly efficient Pt catalyst with |ΔGH*| of 0.09 eV.69 In short, by coupling with the SiC sheet, the |ΔGH*| of the g-C3N4 monolayer can be largely reduced, even close to zero, which would significantly promote the overall HER performance.

4 Conclusions
On the basis of relevant experimental results, we construct several typical 2D/2D SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions with different layer numbers and stacking sequences, including SiC/g-C3N4, SiC/g-C3N4/SiC, and SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 nanocomposites. In order to verify their substantially promoted photocatalytic performance and reveal the underlying mechanisms, we demonstrate a systematic investigation on their geometrical, electronic, optical, and interfacial properties, as well as the photocatalytic activities in producing hydrogen. Their significantly extended and enhanced UV-vis absorption spectra calculated with the state-of-the-art TDHF-HSE06 method, with respect to the two components, definitely prove their improved photocatalytic performance. More crucially, we uncover 7 advantageous factors for SiC/g-C3N4 photocatalysts: (1) the high buckling height of the g-C3N4 monolayer induced by N2 atoms could strengthen the HER performance of g-C3N4-based layered materials, (2) the formation of type-II heterojunctions is beneficial to retard the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the pure g-C3N4 sheet, (3) the ideal bandgap width (∼2.0 eV) of SiC/g-C3N4 photocatalysts could make them harvest sufficient visible light, (4) the intimate interface contact and strong interfacial interactions between the two components could accelerate the charge transfer and create a considerable built-in electric field, (5) the large electrostatic potential drop and the built-in electric field between the two individuals are favorable for preventing the rapid recombination of photoexcited charge carriers in g-C3N4-based photocatalysts, (6) the delicate balance between the RP and OP in acid and neutral environments contributes to enhancing the photocatalytic activities for SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions, and (7) the largely reduced and near-zero |ΔGH*| in SiC/g-C3N4 hybrids would significantly promote their overall HER performance. Furthermore, the SiC/g-C3N4 multilayers (SiC/g-C3N4/SiC and SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 trilayers) exhibit better photocatalytic performance than the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer, and SiC/g-C3N4 multilayers with various stacking sequences show different advantages as photocatalysts, which may provide rational schemes for designing SiC/g-C3N4-based photocatalysts. All in all, this work not only offers a comprehensive insight into the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for 2D/2D SiC/g-C3N4 heterojunctions, but also provides new strategies for rationally designing highly-effective SiC/g-C3N4 layered photocatalysts in hydrogen production.

 	Fig. 1  The (a) geometrical and (b) projected band structures of the g-C3N4 monolayer, and the (c) geometrical and (d) projected band structures of the SiC monolayer. C, N1, N2 and Si atoms are denoted by brown, pink, grey and blue spheres, respectively, and the green diamonds represent the unit cell of the g-C3N4 (SiC) monolayer. The red and blue lines respectively represent the projection to C and N(Si) atoms, and the Fermi level is set to zero for clarity. (e) PDOS of g-C3N4 (upper panel) and SiC (lower panel) monolayers. (f) The absorption spectra of g-C3N4 and SiC monolayers with DFT and TDHF methods, and the inset denotes the enlarged absorption spectrum of g-C3N4 with TDHF methods in the range of 300–600 nm.

 	Fig. 2  Top (upper panel) and side (lower panel) views of the optimized structures of (a) the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer, (b) SiC/g-C3N4/SiC sandwich structure, and (c) SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 trilayer. The interlayer spacing (along the z axis) between the two individuals, the buckling height of the g-C3N4 monolayer, and the adhesive energies of the three heterojunctions are calculated and given.	 

 	Fig. 3  Projected band structures of the (a) SiC/g-C3N4, (b) SiC/g-C3N4/SiC, and (c) SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 nanocomposites. The red circles, green squares, and blue diamonds stand for the projection of g-C3N4, SiC (SiC-top, SiC-1), and SiC-bottom (SiC-2), respectively. (d) PDOS of g-C3N4 (upper panel) and SiC (lower panel) in the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer. (e) The absorption spectra of SiC/g-C3N4, SiC/g-C3N4/SiC, and SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 heterostructures with DFT and TDHF methods.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Top and (b) side views of the three-dimensional charge density difference for the SiC/g-C3N4 bilayer. Three-dimensional charge density difference of (c) SiC/g-C3N4/SiC and (e) SiC/SiC/g-C3N4. The purple and green isosurfaces respectively represent charge accumulation and depletion in the space with respect to the isolated SiC sheet and g-C3N4 monolayer. The isovalue is 0.0005 e Å−3. (d) The profile of the planar averaged charge density difference for the above three configurations as a function of position in the z-direction. The horizontal dashed dotted lines denote the central location of each atomic layer. The positive and negative values of ρ denote electron depletion and accumulation, respectively.	 
Δρ = ρSiC/g-C3N4 − ρSiC − ρg-C3N4	(3)

 	Fig. 5  Electrostatic potential. The top panel exhibits a profile of the planar averaged self-consistent electrostatic potential for the SiC/g-C3N4, SiC/g-C3N4/SiC, and SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 vdW heterostructures as a function of position in the z direction. For comparison, the positions are aligned with the central location of the single-layered SiC on top of g-C3N4. As a visual guide, the charge in interlayer separation in the above systems is denoted by distinguishing the central location of g-C3N4 and SiC monolayers. The bottom panel demonstrates the visual electrostatic potential of the SiC/g-C3N4/SiC sandwich structure (half of the calculated supercell).	 

 	Fig. 6  Calculated band edge potentials versus normal hydrogen electrodes of SiC, g-C3N4, SiC/g-C3N4, SiC/g-C3N4/SiC, and SiC/SiC/g-C3N4 layers at pH = 0 and 7. The carrier transfer and separation in the three heterojunctions are displayed.	 

 	Fig. 7  The calculated free energy diagram of the HER at the equilibrium potential for the above three SiC/g-C3N4 nanocomposites and their two components for reference.
