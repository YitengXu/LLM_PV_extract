    , Accepted 7th March 2016First published on 9th March 2016AbstractNon-contact bi-directional micropatterning of two-dimensional (2D) layered inorganic–organic (IO) perovskite [(R-NH3)2PbI4, R = organic moiety] thin films by direct laser writing (DLW) has been reported. These 2D materials are in the form of natural multiple quantum well (MQW) structures and show excitonic luminescence at room temperature because of quantum and dielectric confinement effects. Systematic optical and structural analyses of these laser processed hybrid systems provide an insight into laser–matter interaction and a pathway to develop technology to define complex 2D material based devices with new functionalities. These laser–matter interaction studies reveal several concurrent processes: single photon absorption, material ablation, melting and agglomeration of nanostructures and chemical/physical modifications. This study also provides an insight into chemical and optical changes in laser processed 2D perovskites which subsequently can be recovered by chemical processing. Apart from controllable feature sizes, the prolonged laser exposure results in material agglomeration in the form of nano-pillars at the laser track boundaries. Low-cost micro/nano-scaffolding of IO perovskites may have several important advantages in scalable optoelectronic devices, the realisation of luminescent photonic architectures (photonic crystals and waveguides), and light harvesting elements for IO LEDs and solar cells.
Introduction
Recently inorganic–organic (IO) hybrid semiconductors have attracted a lot of attention towards optoelectronic applications.1,2 These materials are the natural molecular-scale interfaces between two diverse materials, with significant contributions and characteristic properties of individuals, resulting in diverse advantages. In particular, metal halide based perovskites, depending on the chemical interaction between inorganic and organic entities, show a wide range of crystal packings: three, two, one and zero dimensionalities, and thus display extremely diverse structural, optical and physical properties.3–9
Control of light emission and/or absorption through photonic structures is a growing field of interest for the development of new methodologies to render new generation optoelectronic devices.10 Various top-down and bottom-up fabrication techniques, such as soft-lithography, screen-printing, colloidal-templating, and chemical/dry etching, have been implemented to fabricate nano/microstructures.11–16 Exclusively the periodic/aperiodic patterning,17,18 from micron scales to nanometric sizes, has become a key to enhance the external quantum efficiencies of optoelectronic devices such as solar panels.19 Since the patterning process for both inorganic (hard) and organic (soft) materials is widely different, it requires utmost care and an in-depth study. Recently, the applications of two-dimensional (2D) IO perovskites in photonic devices were studied by embedding them into microcavities, waveguides, distributed Bragg reflectors and patterned metallic/dielectric gratings10,20–23 using complex fabrication protocols.
Among various patterning methods, direct laser writing (DLW) has attracted much attention, being a non-contact and relatively simpler method than other conventional lithographic techniques.24 So far, DLW has been successfully utilised to pattern a variety of inorganic (such as silicon) and organic (polymers and sol–gel materials) materials.25,26 However, in IO perovskites both organic and inorganic entities are together, and hence optimisation of patterning could be a formidable task, due to lack of sufficient information on laser induced chemical/physical effects of these hybrid materials. To the best of our knowledge, no such efforts have been made for inorganic–organic hybrid materials to achieve micro/nanostructures using direct methods. In the present report, the study of the laser–matter interaction of 2D perovskite ((R-NH3)2PbI4, R = organic) thin films has been presented. Since the laser–matter interaction is critically dependent on the laser characteristics as well as optical/physical/chemical properties of the materials, an in-depth study is essential prior to laser patterning. A detailed and systematic study has been performed to explain concurrent changes in the morphological and optical properties of 2D perovskites during the direct laser writing process.
Experimental Details
Thin films of 2D layered IO perovskite 2-(1-cyclohexenyl) ethylamine–tetraiodoplumbate, (C6H9C2H4NH3)2PbI4 (CHPI hereafter), are fabricated by using an intercalation method.8,27 In brief, the parent PbI2 thin films (thickness ∼135 nm) are fabricated by evaporating PbI2 powders onto the glass substrate using a thermal vapour deposition method at 10−6 mbar of vacuum.
The organic (C6H9C2H4NH3) guest (CHI hereafter) is synthesized by adding stoichiometric quantities of 2-(1-cyclohexenyl) ethylamine and hydriodic acid (55% grade). The resultant CHI precipitate is extracted and dried. Finally to obtain CHPI, PbI2 thin films are exposed to CHI solution. This intercalation process has been appropriately optimised for CHI concentration (6 mM in toluene) and exposure time (20 s).27
The experimental setup used for direct laser writing consists of a CW diode laser (410 nm, 100 mW), a microscope objective (4×), and a motorized XY stage having a resolution of 0.1 μm (Fig. 1a). The size of the focused laser spot on the sample is about 18 μm. All the experiments are carried out under ordinary room temperature conditions in air. The laser written samples, based on the fabrication, are categorised and hereafter named as (i) laser written PbI2 thin films: l-PbI2 (ii) CHPI obtained after intercalation of CHI into the l-PbI2 thin films: p-CHPI and (iii) laser written CHPI thin films: l-CHPI.

These films are characterised by photoluminescence (PL), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction and micro-Raman analysis. For PL spectra, high resolution optical images (bright field and PL images), spatial intensity maps and spectral line scans are obtained using a modified microscope equipped with a white light source (xenon lamp), a low power (<20 mW) 410 nm CW laser, a motorised XY-sample stage, a fiber-optic spectrometer and a high-resolution camera (ESI,† Fig. S1). Both PL spectra and PL images were taken using a long-pass (λ > 425 nm) filter before the spectrometer/camera.
Results
The studies are intended to understand laser–matter interaction on IO layered perovskites, leading to laser writing of a wide variety of photonic structures for many applications. The two-dimensional (2D) IO perovskites are represented by a general formula of type (R-NH3)2MX4 where R is an organic moiety (CnH2n+1, C6H5CnH2netc.), M is a divalent metal (Pb2+, Sn2+etc.) and X is a halide (such as I−, Br− and Cl−). Typically, IO perovskites are realised by the insertion of ammonium based organic moieties into layered perovskites (PbI2) as shown in Fig. 1(c). During the solution processing, one PbI42− anion and two organic R-NH3+ cations are bound together through hydrogen bonding to form self-assembled (R-NH3)2PbI4 unit cells as infinitely-extended corner-shared PbI6 octahedral sheets separated by organic bi-cations (Fig. 1c and ESI,† Fig. S2). A direct fabrication of quality thin films of 2D IO hybrids from parent PbI2 has been recently demonstrated by us via intercalation of organic moieties and the key role of the Van der Waals interactions between the perovskite layers has also been established.8,27,28 As a consequence of dielectric mismatch and quantum confinement related effects these naturally self-assembled quantum wells, unlike parent PbI2, show narrow and intense room-temperature exciton photoluminescence at about 518 nm (Fig. 1d). Due to dissimilarities in optoelectronic properties of parent inorganic (PbI2) and chemically resultant IO perovskites (CHPI), the understanding of laser–matter interaction and corresponding microstructure fabrication are thus worthy of pursuit.
The direct laser writing optimisation has been performed systematically using the experimental setup mentioned in Fig. 1. The laser induced morphological effects are studied by varying parameters such as the sample stage scan-rate, incident laser power density, etc. Apart from these experimental parameters, other factors such as the crystalline/amorphous nature of material, full-width at half-maxima (FWHM) of the laser beam, thermal conductivity of films, etc., also play a vital role in modifying the surface morphology and structural properties.29–32
The laser writing process has been successfully optimized for thermally deposited PbI2 films (of thickness ∼135 nm). Fig. 2(I) shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of micropatterned PbI2 (hereafter, l-PbI2) thin films, fabricated at various laser power densities from 3.14 × 103 W cm−2 to 2.54 × 104 W cm−2. The scan step size has been fixed at 0.01 mm for a given laser spot size of ϕ = 18 μm. Fig. 2(II) shows the resultant laser writing width variation with respect to different laser power densities. Similarly, Fig. 2(III) shows variation of writing width with respect to different sample scan step sizes at a fixed laser power density (2.54 × 104 W cm−2). It is observed that as the scan rate increases from 2.5 μm s−1 (0.1 μm step size) to 8.72 mm s−1 (8 mm step size) the laser written track width decreases (Fig. 2(III) and ESI,† Fig. S3). Periodic ripple-like structures (Fig. 2) observed at certain combinations of laser power densities and scan rates are due to the mismatch between the irradiated laser spot and the scan speed. Furthermore, below certain threshold laser power densities (<5 × 103 W cm−2) the writing width and depth decreased at the expense of surface modification. Essentially, the laser interaction with the perovskite films resulted in several simultaneous phenomenon: physical material ablation, chemical modification and/or surface roughness, and nano/microstructures within and around the laser exposed area. All these aspects are systematically discussed in the forthcoming sections. Separate tests were also conducted to ensure that the given laser powers do not affect the glass substrate.

Laser wavelength, λ = 410 nm; laser spot size ϕ = 18 μm. 
The morphology of the laser interacted areas of PbI2 (hereafter l-PbI2) and CHPI (hereafter l-CHPI) has been compared and it has been observed that both show similar physical characteristics (ESI,† Fig. S4). The l-PbI2 films are chemically processed to obtain CHPI (hereafter p-CHPI) using the procedure described in the Experimental section. The strong and narrow line width exciton PL of IO perovskites has been utilised as a tool to understand the resultant changes in chemical as well as physical properties. The room temperature photoluminescence properties (spectral-intensity spatial-mapping and confocal PL imaging) of both p-CHPI (processed from l-PbI2) and l-CHPI (direct laser written on CHPI) thin films have been studied in detail and compared. Fig. 3(a and b) show the confocal PL images of p-CHPI and l-CHPI, respectively. Laser-written and un-exposed areas of p-CHPI show considerable intense green PL, with a peak maximum at ∼518 nm. However, in the l-CHPI film the PL is undetectable within the laser written region. These observations provide an insight into the effect of laser interaction in both the systems, which will be discussed in the later sections. However, the PL from the laser written area is completely reversible, by re-intercalation of laser written CHPI (l-CHPI) with the organic moiety CHI. Fig. 3j shows the recovered PL from the laser written area after the re-interaction process. Here it is to be noted that the PL from the recovered region is slightly blue-shifted as compared to bare CHPI films (Fig. 1d).

Left and right side figures indicate p-CHPI and l-CHPI, respectively. 
In order to quantify the aforementioned observations, the PL line-scan spectral maps (Fig. 3c and d) are monitored corresponding to the optical images shown in Fig. 3(e and f) for p-CHPI and l-CHPI, respectively. The transverse line scans of PL peak intensities have been extracted and plotted separately in Fig. 3(g and h). In p-CHPI, the PL intensities in the laser written area are only slightly reduced by about 20%, whereas in l-CHPI the PL is barely detectable. In another experiment, the laser written CHPI (l-CHPI) films are re-intercalated with CHI under similar conditions, Interestingly l-CHPI has regained the strong PL in the laser written areas (Fig. 3i and j) with a slight decrease in intensity compared to the non-written areas. However, such regain in the PL is associated with a slight blue-shift in the PL peak position, as compared to bare CHPI (Fig. 1d). This blue-shift in PL can be ascribed to thickness variation, due to material removal during the laser exposure. In our previous communications, we have reported the blue-shifted PL peak positions with the decrease in thickness of IO perovskite thin films.8,10 It was concluded that such thickness variation in exciton PL peak position is either due to either distortion of the (PbI4)2− extended network or due to the low-level presence of unreacted iodine.8,10
The PL spatial mapping (Fig. 4) and AFM imaging (Fig. 5 and ESI,† Fig. S5) at the boundaries of laser written tracks for p-CHPI and l-CHPI have been performed and found to be furthermore interesting. Slight differences in the laser written channel widths and sharp edge features can be explained by considering the laser induced porosity or material debris spilled out during laser ablation. The material spillage is more in l-CHPI (direct laser writing on CHPI) than p-CHPI (laser written PbI2 and converted into CHPI) thin films. This suggests that CHPI is more fragile and porous than the bare PbI2, hence, laser ablation demonstrates more impact on l-CHPI films. Therefore, it can be speculated that the laser interaction results in the agglomeration of micro/nanoparticles and particle clusters at the boundaries which eventually increases the boundary thickness and thus increases the resultant PL intensity (Fig. 4).

To further confirm the presence of debris distribution at the boundaries, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been performed. (Fig. 5 and ESI,† Fig. S5). As seen from figures, nano-pillar like structures are distributed along both edges of the written tracks, with diameters varying from 500 nm to a few microns. The average height of nano-pillars is 230–240 nm. The formation of such nano-pillars during the laser interaction could be due to deposition of nano debris formed during the thermal ablation. The average roughness of the boundaries is about 40 nm when compared to bare films having a roughness of about 10 nm.
The laser induced material modification has been determined from elemental composition using energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). Fig. 6(a and b) are the SEM images of p-CHPI and l-CHPI. Fig. 6(c, e) and (d, f) are the SEM images of iodine (I) and lead (Pb) elemental area mapping, taken across the same area. The stoichiometric elemental densities of iodine and lead in unwritten areas are comparable to the expected composition of CHPI. In p-CHPI laser written parts the elemental compositions are nearly stoichiometric, whereas in l-CHPI significant stoichiometric variations are observed.

Discussion
The experimental demonstration of laser writing on layered perovskite thin films provides exclusive information on laser–matter interaction. Essentially the structural modification either in parent PbI2 or IO perovskite thin films strongly supports the fact that during the laser writing process several concurrent events happen, namely material ablation, melting and agglomeration of nanostructures and chemical/physical modifications. In fact, the laser wavelength (3.02 eV) is above the bandgap of PbI2 (2.5 eV) and within the overlapped spectral region of the charge transfer absorption band and direct bandgap edge (inorganic) of IO perovskite CHPI.33
Therefore, the occurrence of laser interaction in these systems is predominantly due to a single photon absorption related mechanism. The possible laser–material interaction sequences during laser writing of layered IO perovskite thin films and further consequences are explained as follows (Fig. 7):
 Fig. 7  Schematic of the laser material interaction mechanism of IO perovskite laser writing. 
1. During the laser–material interaction, the imparted energy diffuses into the surrounding area.34 Due to a relatively high power density at the laser focus spot, the local temperature of the interaction zone increases, which is known as the temperature affected zone.
2. Once the material starts melting and consequently the material evaporation takes place, forming a plasma plume which consists of evaporated hot IO perovskite nanoparticles.
3. Due to gravitational pull and temperature gradients, these hot nanoparticles release heat and start condensing at the nearby edge area (Fig. 4, 5 and ESI,† Fig. S5).
The size of the plasma plume depends on laser power density and time of interaction. As supporting evidence, the effect of laser interaction time on the size of the plasma plume is demonstrated in Fig. 8. Laser-written CHPI structures (l-CHPI) are obtained at different scan speeds from 10−4 to 10−2 mm s−1. The optical microscopy images are obtained after white light balance and the green color is due to strong ∼450–500 nm reflection from the excess CHPI powder spillage. The material agglomerated (or material spillage) width changes from ∼80 μm to ∼20 μm, with the scan speed variation from 10−4 to 10−2 mm s−1. Such dependence of the spillage length on the laser scanning rate can be attributed to the time of interaction between the IO perovskites and the laser beam. Eventually, the heat affected zone and/or the ablated region contains the IO perovskites having destroyed layered arrangement (Fig. 3 and 6). Therefore, it is convenient to speculate that with the reduction of laser–matter interaction time (scan speed) the material spillage zone of nanoparticles decreases rapidly.
 Fig. 8  Optical microscopy images of l-CHPI obtained at laser scan speeds of (a) 10−4 (b) 10−3 and (c) 10–0.01 mm s−1 (laser power density = 2.54 × 104 W cm−2, laser focus spot size ϕ = 18 μm). White line bars indicate roughly estimated widths of material agglomerated areas. 
Now let us discuss the stoichiometric changes in IO perovskites during laser irradiation, from PL measurements (Fig. 3) and compositional analysis (Fig. 6). In Fig. 3, the laser written area of p-CHPI (laser written PbI2 converted into CHPI) shows considerable PL, whereas directly written CHPI (l-CHPI), hardly shows any PL. As mentioned before, both bare PbI2 and IO perovskite CHPI are layered atomic arrangements with infinitely extended (PbI4)2− networks and are stacked along the c-axis with inter-layer separation. The exciton PL in 2D IO perovskites is strongly dependent on the layered arrangement, wherein the infinitely extended PbI6 octahedral networks are separated by two ammonium-based cations, tagged by weak hydrogen bonding (ESI,† Fig. S2). Therefore, the decrease or disappearance of PL could be ascribed to the distortion of the layered arrangement. The destabilised layered arrangement in the (PbI4)2− extended network is due to (a) evaporation of the organic moiety and/or (b) bond breaking of terminal iodine (easily removable as compared to strongly bonded bridging iodine).27
In fact PbI2, a network of interconnected bridging iodines is structurally much stable than CHPI. Therefore during the laser writing process of PbI2, the laser interaction is predominantly material ablation, whereas in CHPI it is dominated by structural deformation of the PbI network. During laser writing on PbI2, only top few layers are affected and/or dislocated, therefore after intercalation (p-CHPI) the laser written portion retains PL with some reduction in intensity. Even the composition analysis (Fig. 6) suggests a near stoichiometric Pb/I composition in p-CHPI (as well as l-PbI2), which is evidence of rigidity of bridging iodines in the PbI network. Previous studies of CW-UV laser irradiation on PbI2 have suggested that the laser induced heating effects involve two processes: the slow heat penetration perpendicular to the layers and a fast dissipation parallel to the layers.35 Such relative thermal dissipation in PbI2 was claimed due to a difference of two orders of magnitude between perpendicular and parallel components of thermal conductivity (∼1 mW cm−1 K−1 and 100 mW cm−1 K−1 respectively).35,36 Since (R-NH3)2PbI4 layered perovskite crystal packing is not very different from PbI2, similar fast heat dissipation parallel to the layers can also be expected in CHPI, which could possibly explain the evaporation of the organic moiety and partial deformation of the layered structure in l-CHPI. However, such deformation could be retained by the re-intercalation process, which is supported by the experimental evidence (Fig. 3i and j).
The experimental demonstration of laser written width variation and power density (P) dependence (Fig. 2) could be visualised as dwidth = Klog(P/Pth), where, K is a constant involving thermal diffusion, absorption coefficient, etc., and Pth is the power density threshold.37 As seen from Fig. 2(II), the experimental results are in close agreement with the aforementioned speculative expression. However, the effect of laser writing on depth could not be pursued further due to experimental limitations of 2D perovskite thin films (thicknesses limited to about 100–150 nm).8,27 In general, patterning or micro/nano-scaffolding of soft materials has several advantages: light harvesting grating and disordered/ordered mesoporous materials for LEDs and photovoltaic devices, flexible electronics and production of photonic devices such as waveguides, bio-photonic fluidic channels, photonic crystals etc.21,38,39 Recently metal halide perovskites have attracted great interest for application in solar cell and LED technologies, wherein the patterning and microstructures of perovskites are essential key factors.19,40 Therefore, the current findings offer a lot of advantages and require further exploration. For example, the studies could be further extended to ultrafast lasers wherein the laser–matter dynamics are very different and interesting in terms of the fundamental as well as applied science point of view.
Conclusion
The present work successfully demonstrated versatile and low-cost and non-contact micro/nanopatterning of inorganic–organic (IO) perovskites ((R-NH3)2PbI4 where R = organic moiety) using a direct laser writing method. Having both inorganic and organic moieties in a single entity, such patterning would not be so easy using other conventional lithography-based contact techniques. A detailed study has been performed to investigate the issues related to localised laser–perovskite material interaction. Essentially the observed structural modification in perovskites strongly supports the fact that during the laser writing process, several concurrent events happen, namely material ablation and agglomeration of nanostructures and chemical/physical modifications. Pattern sizes can be controlled by scan speed, laser power and laser spot size. Prolonged exposure to laser further resulted in the agglomeration of nanoparticles at the boundaries. The laser-induced effects on IO perovskites result in much interesting photoluminescence and structural properties and they are discussed in detail. While, the light–matter interaction in these perovskite structures is predominantly a one-photon absorption process, and it is further observed that the laser induced thermal diffusion preferentially destabilises the IO perovskite crystal packing (or layered arrangement). However, such structural changes are easily reversible by a simple chemical process. The current findings offer several advantages in IO LEDs and photovoltaic devices, flexible electronics and production of photonic devices such as waveguides, bio-photonic fluidic channels, and photonic crystals.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic of the experimental setup used for direct laser writing, (b) the SEM image of laser written PbI2 (l-PbI2) films, (c) a schematic representation of PbI2 conversion into layered perovskite CHPI and (d) exciton photoluminescence of pure CHPI, l-CHPI and re-intercalated l-CHPI thin films.	 

 	Fig. 2  (I) SEM images of laser written PbI2 thin films (∼135 nm) at different laser power densities: (a) 2.54 × 104 (b) 2.19 × 104 (c) 1.88 × 104 (d) 1.57 × 104 (e) 1.256 × 104 (f) 9.42 × 103 (g) 6.28 × 103 (h) 3.14 × 103 W cm−2. The resultant written area width is indicated by dotted yellow lines. Plots of estimated widths of written channels against (II) laser power densities (scan step size = 0.01 mm) and (III) scan step size (laser power density = 2.54 × 104 W cm−2). Laser wavelength, λ = 410 nm; laser spot size ϕ = 18 μm.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a and b) Confocal microscopy exciton PL images, (c and d) exciton PL spectral line mapping across the laser written tracks and (e and f) the corresponding optical white-light microscope images of p-CHPI and l-CHPI, respectively. (g and h) PL peak intensity (at λ = 518 nm) line scan profiles of (c) and (d), respectively. (i and j) PL images of l-CHPI films before and after re-intercalation with CHI, respectively (see text). Left and right side figures indicate p-CHPI and l-CHPI, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a and d) Optical microscopy images, (b and e) PL peak intensity (at λ = 518 nm) spatial mapping and (c and f) PL intensity line scans (extracted from (b and e)) of p-CHPI and l-CHPI, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) SEM image of laser written CHPI thin films (l-CHPI) and (b) the corresponding AFM image and (c) three-dimensional view of the image (b), which clearly shows material agglomeration as nano-pillars at the boundaries.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a and b) SEM Images and corresponding (c and d) iodine {I} and (e and f) lead {Pb} elemental maps obtained using EDX. The cross-sectional views (indicated in vertical lines in (a) and (b)) are given in (g and h) and (i and j) for iodine and lead elements. Left and right side figures indicate p-CHPI and l-CHPI, respectively. White, red, and blue lines are a guide to the eye.
