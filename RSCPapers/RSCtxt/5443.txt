    , Accepted 11th April 2023First published on 16th May 2023AbstractPhotoelectrochemical or electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to produce formate is a potential strategy to reduce greenhouse gases. In the past few years, various catalysts and modification strategies have been developed to improve the selectivity and solar-to-formate conversion efficiency, accelerating the practical applications of this technology. Among them, more attention was paid to the post-transition metal block-based catalysts due to their high formate selectivity. Herein, representative post-transition metal block-based (indium (In), tin (Sn), bismuth (Bi), etc.) catalysts and engineering strategies in regulating the CO2 reduction selectivity and activity toward formate are summarized. First, the advantages and fundamental mechanism of CO2 reduction to formate were discussed. After that, an overview of selectivity and stability of catalysts, and in situ/operando characterization were discussed for deepening the understanding of the reaction mechanisms and catalyst design theory. Subsequently, the photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction systems were analyzed to provide insight for designing the structure of the photoelectrochemical device or cell. To conclude, the future challenges, concerns, directions, and applications are summarized and prospected.
1 Introduction
Energy is the key to global economic development. However, with the rapid growth of the global population and rapid development of industrialization, the global energy demand continues to increase, leading to the continuous increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.1-4 Nowadays, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased from 320 ppm in 1960 to 420 ppm (November 2022).5
To mitigate climate change, the increased rate of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere must be reduced. In past decades, there were tremendous concerns on various strategies such as carbon capture, carbon burial, and carbon utilization. Conversion of CO2 to high-value chemicals or fuels is one of the promising ways, which included thermochemical,6 biochemical,7 photochemical,8 and electrochemical9 conversion methods. Thermochemical and biochemical conversion can take place even in the absence of light. Photochemical conversion can directly utilize sunlight for chemical conversion reactions. However, this conversion method existed the problem of the difficulty separation of catalytic materials and products.
The electrochemical approach coupled with solar energy forming a photoelectrochemical system is more attractive for practical applications to promote artificial photosynthesis, compared to the other systems, due to the merits of facile gas-product separation and material handling.10 Besides electrochemical or photoelectrochemical conversion, CO2 reduction not only can produce high-value-added chemicals and fuels but also can operate at room temperature and ambient pressure.
CO2 reduction is a complex reaction, which is related to multi-proton coupled with multi-electron transfer. And this reaction forms various carbonaceous products such as carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), ethylene (C2H4), formate (HCOO−), acetic acid (CH3COOH), ethanol (C2H5OH) etc.11 Among the products, HCOO−, as an important chemical basic raw material, is the key reaction intermediate for the synthesis of downstream products such as formate ester, formamide, and other chemicals.12 At present, the industrial production method of HCOO− is mainly methanol carbonylation, which belongs to the energy-intensive industries with the issues of environmental pollution problems.13 Therefore, the concerned electrochemical or photoelectrochemical technology to convert CO2 into HCOO− is a significant and promising technology.
As shown in Fig. 1, this strategy not only reduces the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere but also forms a zero-carbon emission system combined with clean energy such as solar or wind energy. In a future carbon-neutral society, formate can be used as hydrogen storage materials, feed preservatives, and other chemical raw materials, where the released CO2 could be cyclically utilized by photoelectrochemical or electrochemical conversion to formate.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the photoelectrochemical and electrochemical CO2RR to formate products powered by renewable solar energy and the common conversions and applications of formate. 
Currently, the electrocatalytic materials that are used for the CO2RR to formate are mainly based on In, Sn, Bi, palladium (Pd), lead (Pb), and copper (Cu) metals.14 Among them, the main group metals In, Sn, and Bi achieved more attention and have made great progress by virtue of their advantages of low toxicity, high performance, and relatively low cost.15 Herein, this review summarizes the recent advances of In, Sn, and Bi-based electrocatalytic materials in electrochemical CO2 reduction to HCOO−. We also compared the faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate with different current density ranges, the achieved maximum current density, and the maintained stability under different electrolyte etc. parameters to provide an efficient strategy to design the catalyst for the conversion of CO2 to formate. First, the physical and chemical properties of CO2 molecules are introduced. The economic viability and reaction mechanism for the electroreduction of CO2 to HCOO− are reviewed and discussed. Furthermore, the design and optimization strategy of HCOO− production was summarized and commented based on the performance parameters. Then, the photoelectrochemical CO2 electrolysis technology was analyzed by taking the CO2 electroreduction coupled solar energy. Finally, the current challenges and future industrial prospects for CO2 electroreduction to HCOO− are discussed and proposed. The main purpose of summarizing and discussing photoelectrochemical or electrochemical is to provide readers with strategies that can effectively improve catalyst selectivity and the direction of future activity regulation.
2 Advantages of CO2 reduction to HCOO−
Conventional formic acid manufacturing has four resource-intensive pathways: (1) methyl formate hydrolysis, (2) oxidation of hydrocarbons, (3) hydrolysis of formamide, and (4) preparation of free FA from formate, which produce a high carbon footprint of around 2.2 kgCO2 kgFA−1. However, the carbon footprint of the CO2RR to formate is only 0.166 kgCO2 kgFA−1.16 In terms of their market prices ($ per kg) and added values per kW h electrical energy input based on the ideal full cells, the normalized value of 0.43 $ per kW h was estimated on the production of HCOO− compared with those of other products (CO: 0.37 $ per kW h, CH4: 0.04 $ per kW h, CH3OH: 0.13 $ per kW h, C2H4: 0.31 $ per kW h and C2H5OH: 0.24 $ per kW h).17 The current formic acid market demand continues to increase.18 Herein, HCOO− is the most profitable potential product, which was indicated by technical and economic analysis.19 Developing large-scale CO2RR to formate systems coupled with renewable energy could be a promising strategy in the future.
3 Mechanism of electroreduction CO2 to HCOOH
CO2 molecules are composed of oxygen (O) and carbon (C) atoms, whose bond length and bond energy of CO are 116 pm and 803 kJ mol−1 respectively.20 They are held together by sharing electrons and hold strong electrical affinities which contain a center of symmetry, circular axial symmetry, and the horizontal plane of symmetry. Therefore, the activation of the CO2 molecule is a critical step during the CO2RR process.
3.1 Basic reaction mechanism of CO2 to formate
Given this, it is necessary to input electrons to activate CO2 into an excited state of CO2˙−, and further, achieve CO2 electroreduction.21 As shown in Fig. 2a, the active CO2 has two different adsorption forms on the surface of the electrode, which will lead to different intermediates and products. If the C atom adsorbed on the surface, *COOH was achieved, which produces the carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbon products. However, as the O atom adsorbed on the surface, the HCOO* intermediate formed, which will produce a formate product.21–23 Therefore, the reaction path of *COOH formation is a competitive reaction to form formic acid/formate.

3.2 New reaction mechanism of CO2 to formate by introduced OH groups
As electrolysis proceeds at the electrode–electrolyte interface, the nature of the catalyst surface will affect the activity and product selectivity.24 Recently, there has been an increasing interest in determining the role of surface hydroxyls during theCO2RR to formate, which is different from other formed products.25 The Andrew B. Bocarsly group demonstrated that the selectivity of CO2 to formate is enhanced by manipulating the electrode oxidation state to form a metal–hydroxide-rich surface.26 Besides, ex/in situ attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) was performed to verify the hydroxide group on In2O3/In and Sn/SnOx electrodes.26,27 And then they proposed a mechanism, where the CO2 molecule was inserted into hydroxide and formed the *OCOOH intermediate (Fig. 2b). The reaction mechanism was also verified by the density functional theory (DFT) results. The Qingfeng Ge group proposed that H2O dissociates on the perfect SnO monolayer into two hydroxyl groups symmetrically on the surface.28 CO2 energetically prefers to react with the hydroxyl, forming a bicarbonate intermediate, which can then be reduced to either formate by hydrogenating the carbon atom or carboxyl by protonating the oxygen atom. Deng et al. proposed the beneficial role of surface hydroxyls on SnOx during the CO2RR by forming H2CO3 intermediates via hydrogen bonds.29 They further proposed a volcano-type relationship between the concentration of surface hydroxyls and the rate of formate production. Higher coverage of surface hydroxyls could lead to self-reduction of the Sn–OH sites that were competing with the CO2RR. Recently, Dutta et al. showed that surface Bi–O or Bi–OH went through a partial exchange with CO2 or HCO3− to form Bi–CO3–Bi species at low overpotentials, which were intermediates to form formate but could be reduced to metallic Bi0 at high overpotentials.30
4 Electrochemical CO2RR to formate on In, Sn, and Bi-based catalysts
In this section, we will illustrate the current development status of the electrochemical CO2RR to formate on In, Sn, and Bi-based catalysts owing to their high selectivity to formate and wide popularity in the literature. Besides, elucidating the structure−activity relationship of catalysts can also benefit the rational design of highly active and selective electrocatalysts. Therefore, this section will be divided into In, Sn, and Bi-based catalysts in three parts to introduce the design strategy of the catalyst, active site regulation, stability optimization, etc. in detail. Each part starts with two main factors: selectivity, and stability, to analyze and summarize the design strategies for improving catalyst activity of CO2 reduction to formate. To aid readers in better digesting a large amount of information, we prepare Tables 1–3, Fig. 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 14 to summarize and compare the performances of different electrocatalysts covered in the following discussion.

4.1 In-based catalysts for CO2 to formate
In, a low-toxicity p-block metal, has been regarded as a potential electrocatalyst for this purpose due to its intrinsic high overpotential for the HER and high selectivity for formate production.25,31 The FE or selectivity, current density, and stability are the parameters that are of most concern for the CO2 reduction reaction. Therefore, we first summarized and presented the relationship between the performance of In-based catalysts and current density as applied in a flow cell to analyze and compare the effects of different activation strategies on catalyst performance (Fig. 3). The relationship of FE of formate and the range of current density on the In-based catalyst in 1 M KOH electrolyte is summarized in Fig. 3a. First, we found that the bimetallic or bimetallic sulfides exhibited a wider current density with FE > 90% than other types of catalysts.32,33 Compared with other catalysts, the widest current density ranging from −100 mA cm−2 to −600 mA cm−2 on the AgIn5S8 catalyst was achieved, where the corresponding FE of formate was above 90%.33 Second, the catalyst via the carbon support strategy to improve the selectivity at higher current density is another effective strategy, although its activity is lower than that of bimetallics or bimetallic sulfides.34,35 Third, modified oxygen vacancies or functional groups also enhanced the performance of the catalyst in alkaline electrolytes.36,37 Herein, we think that combining the carbon support with bimetallics or bimetallic sulfides may be an effective strategy to further improve the current density with higher formate selectivity.
Besides, some studies report the enhanced selectivity of formate on various catalysts in different electrolytes. Therefore, the relationship between FE and the current density range in different electrolytes is also summarized in Fig. 3b. The current density reached −1 A cm−2 with formate FE of 90% in 3 M KOH electrolyte on InP CQDs, which is higher than that on ZnIn2S4 in 1 M KHCO3 and AgIn5S8 1 M KOH electrolyte.38 That is to say, the increase in pH value will affect the maximum current density. The phenomenon may be due to higher ionic conductivity and concentration of OH− groups, which can increase the charge transfer rate and enhance the surface adsorption of OH groups. Although the catalysts were different, this rule can also provide some reference for the selection of electrolytes during the CO2RR. In the following, we will discuss the details of the modified strategy combined with the catalysts summarized in Fig. 3.

4.1.1 Selectivity of In-based catalysts modified by various strategies in the flow cell. 
In 1994, Hori et al. reported that the CO2RR catalyzed by the bulk In electrode achieved 95% faradaic efficiency for formate and an overall current density of −5 mA cm−2.39 To obtain high formic acid selectivity at higher current density, various strategies are proposed to optimize the performance of In-based catalysts. Especially in the flow cell, its selectivity and current density were greatly improved due to it overcoming the trouble of slow mass transport of CO2. Table 1 shows the In-based catalysts with the corresponding current density, FE, stability, and electrolyte.
Metal oxides or metal oxide-derived catalysts were considered effective materials for improving the performance of CO2 reduction. Indium oxides also presented an enhanced performance for CO2 reduction to formate.22,40 Besides, there are reports demonstrating that the OH groups form more easily on the surface of indium oxides than other metal-based oxides, which can stabilize CO2 molecules, and improve the selectivity of formate.25 Introducing metals to modify the indium oxides was also proposed by Jhong et al. They synthesized Sn-doped indium oxide nanocrystal catalysts for CO2 reduction, which possess enhanced performance and stable metal oxide character during the CO2RR.41 However, the indium-based oxides have not presented high formate selectivity at higher current density due to the reduction of indium oxides and the competitive reaction of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Therefore, various strategies such as defects,36,42 sulfide-doping,33,43 bimetallics,44-49 and carbon support34,50–52 were also proposed to stabilize the oxides and suppress the HER.
Surface defects can regulate the electron density near the Fermi level and produce unsaturated coordination sites and dangling bonds, thus enhancing the adsorption capability toward the key intermediates. Guo and co-workers used solid-state laser synthesized defect-rich indium nanoparticles (L-In), which exhibit excellent performance to formate with a faradaic efficiency of 98% with −360 mA cm−2 at −0.62 V vs. RHE.42 DFT calculations suggest that the defects facilitate the formation of the *OCHO intermediate and stabilize the *HCOOH while inhibiting hydrogen adsorption. Vacancy formation also can introduce a local defective environment, which benefits the activity of CO2. For example, Zhang and co-workers synthesized porous indium oxynitride nanosheets with the simultaneous incorporation of nitrogen dopants and oxygen vacancies (Vo-N-InON).36 The work demonstrated that nitrogen dopants and oxygen vacancies form a synergistic effect, contributing to the activation of CO2, facilitating the charge transfer, and reducing the reaction free energy of *OCHO protonation. In a word, surface defects would reduce the formation energy of *OCHO on the surface of the catalyst, and then improve the selectivity of formate.
Besides, the hydrogen adsorption on indium metal is far from the center, identifying the poor performance for the HER.56 However, formate formation needs protons, and the activation of H2O to proton is a slow step during the CO2RR in an alkaline medium.40 Therefore, providing an active proton to the key intermediate can enhance the selectivity of formate. As reported, the electron-rich S sites served as important anchors to boost the dissociation of H2O molecules and generate adsorbed H+ intermediates.43 Subsequently, H+ intermediates and electrons can favorably migrate to *CO2˙− intermediates on the surface of the catalyst, and sustainably generated *HCOO−. Here, a sulfur-doped indium catalyst was reported by the Wang group, which verified that sulfur enhances the activation of water, forming hydrogen species that can readily react with CO2 to produce formate (Fig. 4a–c).43 Finally, the FE of formate (>85%) in a broad range of current density (−25 ∼ 100 mA cm−2) was achieved. Besides, they proposed that the co-existence of oxide species, as well as the nanostructure morphology, may account for the high FE of formate by enhancing the adsorption of CO2 onto catalyst surfaces. Grigioni et al. prepared InP CQDs with 6-mercaptohexanol, where the capping ligand exchange introduces surface sulfur (Fig. 4d).38 This catalyst exhibited −1 A cm−2 current density with FEformate of 90%, which is the highest current density in the published In-based catalysts (Fig. 3b and 4e). They also pointed out that sulfur sites cleave water and provide protons to the intermediate (Fig. 4f). Besides, tuning the size of InP CQDs will increase the exposed surface indium sites per quantum dot and enable the high formate productivity achieved at low catalyst loadings. In summary, promoting the splitting of H2O molecules to protons can accelerate the formation of the *OCHO intermediate and enhance the selectivity of formate.

However, there is a problem with the S leaching in the In2S3 catalyst at higher current density during CO2 reduction.32 Therefore, another metal such as Zn, Ag, Al, or Mn was introduced in In2S3, leading to higher selectivity and stability at higher current density. Wang et al. reported ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets with abundant Zn vacancies, which achieved a partial current density of −245 mA cm−2 with a near-unity faradaic efficiency of 94% for formate.55 They contributed to the enhanced selectivity of the catalyst to abundant Zn vacancies, which increase the active surface area and optimized the intermediate binding energy. Recently, Chi et al. also reported indium sulfide with zinc added forming the ZnIn2S4 catalyst, which exhibited a formate faradaic efficiency of 99.3% at −300 mA cm−2 over 60 h of continuous operation (Fig. 5a and b).32 Combining experiments and theoretical studies, they think that zinc enhanced the covalency of In–S bonds. The sulfur site can activate H2O to react with CO2 yielding the HCOO* intermediate. These two studies achieved the same phase catalyst and similar performance. But the stability was different, which we attributed to two reasons: (1) the different operating electrolytes 1 M KOH and 1 M KHCO3. During long-term CO2 reduction in 1 M KOH, the carbonate would form on the back of the GDE, leading to flooding of the GDE and affecting its performance. And operating in KHCO3 electrolyte can mitigate this problem. (2) Another reason we think is due to the existence of Zn vacancies, which cannot stabilize the In–S bond, leading to S leaching during CO2 reduction at higher current density.

Zhang et al. introduced Mn dopants into In2S3 nanosheets to enhance both FE and current density.57 They revealed that Mn doping enables the harmonic overlaps between the p orbitals of O atoms and d orbitals of Mn atoms near the conduction band edge of Mn-doped In2S3 nanosheets during the activation of CO2. The newly formed states in the gap region are expected to facilitate the charge transfer between Mn–In2S3 nanosheets and adsorbed HCOO* intermediates, thus promoting the formation of HCOO* on the Mn–In2S3 slab. Both sulfur and silver were introduced by Zhang and co-workers for deriving a dual-decorated indium quasi-core–shell structure, which exhibited a FEformate of 94% with a partial current density of −561 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5c).33 They found that the catalyst with Ag caused the surface strain effect, which alters the electronic structure. Tuning the atomic composition and thickness of shells can engineer the strain effect (tensile or compressive), which modified the energy barrier of the CO2RR and facilitated the formation rate of formate. In general, doping metals can enhance the In–S bond or cause surface strain, which can modify the formation energy of the *OCHO intermediate and improve the selectivity of formate.
As reported, the charge transfer rate of an In-based catalyst can be enhanced by carbon layer encapsulation or compositing with carbon materials, leading to promoted selectivity of formate at higher current density. For example, Pan et al. provide a strategy by annealing the MIL-68(In) to form an In2O3@CNR catalyst, which exhibits a formate faradaic efficiency of 90.5% with ∼−108 mA cm−2 partial current density and maintains 12 h in 1 M KOH (Fig. 5d).51 Wang et al. present herein a carbon-confined indium oxide, where the carbon protection prevents the reductive corrosion of oxidative indium to the metallic state during electrolysis, meanwhile optimizing the adsorption of the intermediate.34 Wu et al. showed that adding cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to In/C leads to effective reduction of CO2 to formic acid.58 Wang et al. proposed In2O3 ⊃ NC@GO nanohybrids, in which In2O3 nanoparticles were encapsulated by an N-doped carbon (NC) shell and supported on graphene.52 The multiple components synergistically optimize the structure and electronic properties of the material. This separation effect exposes more active sites for the electrochemical reaction. And the charge transfer during the electrocatalysis process is effectively enhanced due to the carbon components. In addition, Chen et al. prepared nickel-doped indium oxide nanocrystals encapsulated in a carbon nanofiber catalyst, owing to the synergistic effect of carbon encapsulation and nickel doping in enhancing the adsorption strength of CO2 and OCHO* intermediate and accelerating the charge transfer rate by Ni doping change the electronic structure and C encapsulation improving the charge transfer (Fig. 5e and f).35 Therefore, accelerating the charge transfer rate would improve the performance of the catalyst.
There are other strategies such as core–shell structures,49,54,59 size effect,60 two-dimensional (2D) structures,55 single atoms,61,62etc., which were published and discussed that can improve the performance of the catalysts by modifying the electronic environment or adsorption of the intermediates. In a word, promoting the charge transfer rate, or changing the local electronic environment can modify the adsorption and reduce the energy barrier of intermediates formation, contributing to enhanced formate selectivity of the catalyst. Herein, the design strategy of the catalyst can be influenced by these factors in the future.


4.1.2 Stability of In-based catalysts in the flow cell. 
Stability is another key factor in measuring the performance of the catalyst. Here we have compared different electrolyte types to obtain more favorable stability test parameters. It can be seen from the summary results that many research groups have obtained considerable stability results.
As shown in Fig. 6a, different modification strategies were presented to improve the stability and selectivity at higher current density. In 1 M KOH electrolyte, the stability time can increase to 135 h at −100 mA cm−2 current density on the AgInS2 catalyst.33 However, with the increased current density, although the FE of formate still maintained above 90%, the stability decreased. Especially at the highest current density of −360 mA cm−2, the stability time decreased to 8 h on the L-In (defect-rich indium) catalyst.42 This is maybe due to the GDE flooding caused by carbonate formation during long-term CO2 reduction in the flow-cell.
 Fig. 6  Comparison of the relationship of stability, FE, and current density for In-based catalysts in (a). 1 M KOH and (b) different electrolytes in the flow cell. The details were shown in Table 1. 
For the different electrolytes, 1 M KOH, 1 M KHCO3, or 3 M KOH, they still presented a similar phenomenon. Among them, the stability time can reach 60 h on ZnInS2 in 1 M KHCO3 at −300 mA cm−2.32 Besides, the L-In catalyst also possesses a long time of 21 h in 1 M KHCO3 compared to that in 1 M KOH.42 Therefore, we think that the selection of electrolytes may be considered during long-term CO2 reactions.

4.2 Sn-based catalysts for CO2 to formate
Sn-based materials are the most promising for large-scale utilization due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high formate selectivity.63,64 However, the competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) severely reduces the economic feasibility and nurtures the desire for a method to control the CO2RR/HER selectivity.
Here, we first summarized the performance of Sn-based catalysts in the flow cell. As shown in Fig. 7, the relationship between the FE of formate and current density is summarized. The higher selectivity of formate concentrated on −50 to −400 mA cm−2 current density for the majority of Sn-based catalysts in the flow cell.65-71 The more negative current density, the fewer the catalysts with selectivity higher than 90%. Among them, only the s-SnLi catalyst shows a FE of 90% at −1.1 A cm−2 current density.65 Therefore, the performance at higher current density needs to be improved in the future.

Similar to indium oxides, the OH groups also formed on the surface of Sn oxides.25,27,28 Liu et al. reported SnO nanosheets bonded with hydroxyl groups, which achieved a faradaic efficiency of 90.5% and a partial current density of −61.8 mA cm−2 for formate at −1.06 V vs. RHE.75 The authors found that the initial OH formation on SnO enhanced the CO2 adsorption and lowered the formation energy of HCOO*, leading to the high selectivity of formate. They reported that surface-adsorbed hydroxyl (OHad) on SnO promoted CO2 reduction into formate through noncovalent interactions. The Oad enhances hydrogen species adsorption to maintain the continuity of OH−ad introduced noncovalent interactions. In addition, the surface hydroxyls can boost CO2 adsorption via hydrogen bonds. As reported by Deng et al., they synthesized Sn–OH catalysts via a cation exchange process, which offered effective sites to boost CO2 adsorption in the form of H2CO3via hydrogen bonds (Fig. 8a–c).29 They proposed that CO2 was reduced to HCOOH through H2CO3*, CO2−, and HCOO* species. In situ formed OH groups on the surface of the catalyst could enhance the CO2 adsorption leading to improved selectivity of formate.

However, the active site Sn(II/IV) would be reduced during CO2 reduction, leading to degradation of performance. Some strategies are proposed to maintain this oxidation state. For example, Pan et al. synthesized a multi-layer SnOx structure by a ligand-confined growth strategy, which could stabilize the formation of Sn(II) species to achieve a highly stable selectivity of formate.76 And the active Sn(II) state was spontaneously oxidized to Sn(IV) species on the surface of the catalyst by loss of the negative potential.
Intermetallics were also developed to improve the selectivity of formate. Introduced sulfur on the surface can suppress the hydrogen evolution, and found to play a role in stabilizing the *OCHO intermediate, weakening the interaction between CO and the electrode,67,78 which is different from In-based catalysts coupled with sulfur. Li et al. reported a catalyst based on two-dimensional SnS2 nanosheets supported on reduced graphene oxide (SnS2/rGO).78 They proposed that the metallic Sn derived from the SnS2 is the catalytic site, which stabilizes the intermediate CO2−. Wang et al. demonstrated that trace sulfur doping facilitates the second protonation and stabilizes the *HCOOH intermediate.68 They think that trace sulfur can suppress hydrogen evolution and enhance CO2 reduction. Here, we contributed this differently to the more active HER on Sn than the one on In. DFT calculation illustrated that the S–Sn surface has moderate adsorption of *HCOO and lowered formation energy for HCOOH. Besides, the polycrystalline SnSx nanofilm also can improve the performance of the CO2 reduction to formate.72 Chen et al. designed a surface oxygen-injection strategy to tune the electronic structure of SnS2 nanosheets, leading to enhanced selectivity of formate.77Operando synchrotron radiation infrared spectroscopy along with theoretical calculations further reveals that the surface oxygen doping facilitated the CO2 activation and enhanced the affinity for HCOO* species (Fig. 8d). As shown in Section 1, the introduced S can provide H to CO2− to form the HCOO* intermediate during modifying In-based catalysts. Here, the different between the suppressed hydrogen evolution on S-doping Sn and provide active proton on S-doping In was contributed to the higher HER activity on Sn than the one on In.
Besides S doping, Te or F was introduced in Sn-based catalysts and showed enhanced performance. Yang et al. developed nanoporous order intermetallic tin-tellurium (SnTe), which achieved over 90% faradaic efficiency in a wide voltage range from −1.0 V to −1.3 V vs. RHE.79 The results demonstrated that strong orbital interaction between Sn and Te lowers the barriers of oxygen cutoff hydrogenation and desorption steps by promoting the fracture of the bond between metal and oxygen, leading to the enhancement of formate production. Ko and co-workers proposed that a high electronegativity of F ions forming stronger F–Sn bonds can contribute to stabilization of the oxidation state and enhanced selectivity of formate at high current (Fig. 8e).66 The F-doped SnO2 exhibited high formate selectivity (≈90%) and was nearly constant over 7 days of operation at a current density of 100 mA cm−2. In a word, nonmetal doping could maintain the oxidation state of Sn and enhance the affinity for HCOO* species, contributing to improved selectivity of formate.
In addition, doping metals increases electron localization and lattice strains on the Sn surface, leading to the change of the adsorption energy of the key intermediates and improved performance. For example, Yan et al. developed a surface-lithium-doped tin (s-SnLi) catalyst by controlled electrochemical lithiation, which demonstrated that Li dopants introduced electron localization and lattice strains on the Sn surface (Fig. 9a–c).65 Finally, the s-SnLi exhibited a formate partial current density of −1.0 A cm−2 with a faradaic efficiency of 92%. Xie et al. developed a NiSn atomic-pair electrocatalyst, leading to the electron redistribution of Sn and reducing the energy barrier of the *OCHO intermediate.81

Cu has poor selectivity for the formate, but combining with Sn and Cu formed Sn/Cu foam, which is conducive to HCOOH formation.82 Besides, the introduction of polyethyleneimine (PEI) enhanced the catalytic capacity of the Sn/Cu foam, stabilized CO2− intermediates, and promoted HCOOH generation. Ye et al. proposed that the Sn–Cu alloy/Sn core can provide sufficient Sn sources for Sn diffusion into the shell and trigger the shell reconstruction, leading to the Sn/SnOx interface to facilitate formic acid formation by suppressing the competitive HER (Fig. 9d).69 Besides, regulating the precursor of the Cu/Sn ratio can affect the surface morphology, exposing more active sites. Wang et al. proposed a Cu2Sn5/Sn catalyst with laser-fabricated channels for improving the selectivity of formate. Chen et al. found that the Sn active site would be optimal by both S-doping and Cu-alloying, leading to improved performance of formate formation by suppressing the CO and H2 pathways simultaneously.83 Wang et al. promoted a self-adapted phase separation method on Cu2SnS3 forming the stable SnO2@CuS and SnO2@Cu2O heterojunction during the electrochemical process.71 And they found that the strongly coupled interfaces as real active sites drove the electron self-flow Sn4+ to Cu+, thereby promoting the delocalized Sn sites to combine HCOO* with H*. Li et al. synthesize a porous Cu–Sn alloy electrode, where alloying Cu with Sn atoms tunes the electronic structure of the catalyst, leading to balancing the adsorption and protonation of the CO2* intermediate.84 Chen et al. proposed electrodeposited Sn on Cu nanowires to improve the selectivity of CO2 reduction to formate, which contributed to a large electroactive surface area and low charge transfer resistance.85 Li et al. revealed the dynamic evolution process and phase transformation of a copper-tin sulfide catalyst reconstructed by in situ reductions of the precatalyst Cu2SnS3 and CuS during electrochemical CO2 reduction. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate the strong charge interaction between the adsorbate and substrate to accelerate the charge transfer and decrease the formation energies of OCHO* and HCOOH*.73
Bi is another catalyst that is preferred to produce formate during CO2 reduction. Incorporation of Bi atoms into Sn species facilitates the HCOO* intermediate to be favorably adsorbed onto the surface of Sn–Bi. Ren et al. proposed that the Sn–Bi interface pattern delivers optimum upshift of the Sn p-band center and, accordingly, the moderate valence electron depletion, which leads to weakened Sn–C hybridization of competing for COOH* and suitable Sn–O hybridization of HCOO* (Fig. 9e–g).80 The Bi L-edge in the Sn–Bi interface and the alloy is close to that of Bi foil, and shows weaker intensity at ∼13440 eV than Bi2O3. Wang et al. fabricated a hierarchical Janus electrocatalyst with SnO2 and Bi2O3 assembled outside and inside the hollow carbon nanofiber skeleton.70 They proposed that the nanostructure effect magnified the performance of Janus active sites. Metal composites can form a synergistic effect, which can regulate the electronic structure of the active center and lower the formation of HCOO*.


4.2.2 Stability of Sn-based catalysts in the flow cell. 
For Sn-based catalysts, there are few studies on stability tests in the flow cell. Besides, some reports demonstrated that the catalysts have excellent stability performance when working in MEA. Herein, we summarized the relationship of the stability with FE and current density in the flow cell and MEA, respectively (Fig. 10). In the flow cell, the SnS nanosheets at −150 mA cm−2 current density possessed 30 h stability in 1 M KOH.67 Compared with SnS nanosheets, SnO2–Bi2O3 at −210 mA cm−2 current density exhibited 48 h stability during the CO2RR.70 With a negative shift of current density to −243 mA cm−2, Sn–Cu/SnOx can maintain a 40 h stability measurement.69 That is to say, bimetallics could achieve a longer stability time than nonmetallic modification. Although the F-doped SnOx showed the longest stability of 178 h, the current density is more positive than that of other catalysts shown in Fig. 10a.66 Herein, we conclude that the stability of the non-metallic modified Sn-based catalyst is not as high as that of the Sn-based bimetallic catalyst, which may be because the non-metallic catalyst is easy to leach into the solution during the reaction process, leading to its poor stability.
 Fig. 10  Comparison of the relationship of stability, FE, and current density for Sn-based catalysts in (a). 1 M KOH in the flow cell and (b) different electrolytes in MEA. The details were shown in Table 2. 
In MEA, the s-SnLi at −120 mA cm−2 current density can maintain 150 h stability.65 The stability of s-SnLi decreased to 24 h stability at more negative current density −300 mA cm−2. With the negative shift of current density to −500 mA cm−2, the 3D hollow nanosphere SnO2 also possessed 24 h stability.74 But the FE of formate on s-SnLi and 3D hollow nanosphere SnO2 was lower than 90%. The polycrystalline SnSx at −260 mA cm−2 current density can maintain 30 h stability with 90% faradaic efficiency.72 As we know, MEA cells can mitigate the carbonate formation, contributing to longer stability. However, the stability of Sn-based catalysts is lower than that of In-based catalysts (Fig. 6 and 10). Therefore, the FE of the Sn-based catalyst needed to be improved in the future.

4.3 The Bi-based catalysts for CO2 to formate
Bi-based catalysts, even though a late start, are receiving much attention, due to their superiority in selectivity towards formic acid/formate.86 Compared with In and Sn metals, the research on Bi-based catalysts is the most. Numerous synthetic strategies have been employed to modulate the structure, morphology, composition, and defects of Bi-based catalysts for achieving high activity, selectivity, and long-term stability in reducing CO2 into formate.
We summarize the relationship between the faradaic efficiency of formate and current density in 1 M KOH for a Bi-based catalyst in the flow cell. As shown in Fig. 11, the current density is concentrated in the range from −400 mA cm−2 to −50 mA cm−2 with a faradaic efficiency of formate of above 90%.87–108 Five catalysts exhibited above FEformate of 90% at more negative current density than −400 mA cm−2. Among them, the current density of Bi NBs and Bi2S3-derived catalysts can reach ampere class.87,107 Especially for Bi2S3-derived catalysts, the current density can reach −2 A cm−2 with 93% formate faradaic efficiency, which is significantly higher than those reported to date.

The morphology and active site engineering of electrocatalysts is an efficient strategy to improve the intrinsic activity and selectivity of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. As for a Bi-based catalyst, the edge site or Bi–O edge site was considered an active site. For example, Zeng and co-workers synthesized Bi nanobelts with a high edge-to-facet ratio, leading to enhanced performance for CO2 reduction with a near-unity formate selectivity.87 The rich edge sites are conducive to the stabilization of the key *OCHO intermediate (Fig. 12b). Besides, the authors thought that the ultralong and interconnected Bi-NBs provide “expressways” for electron transfer (Fig. 12a). Li et al. reported an in-plane confined hydrogen-reduction strategy for in situ growth of edge-modified Bi nanoribbons (Fig. 12c).96 The results demonstrated that the synergistic effect of a preferentially exposed (113) facet and abundant Bi–O edge sites can contribute to reduced formation energy for the formate intermediate (Fig. 12d). Besides, the authors proposed that the active Bi–O sites within high-temperature treatment can remain stable during the whole CO2RR process, contributing to enhanced long-term performance.

(e) Operando Raman spectra of BiPO4-1 as a function of the applied potential in the CO2-saturated electrolyte.91 Copyright 2021, Wiley-VCH GmbH. 
In addition, the nanosheet structure was synthesized, which is different from nanobelts, and exhibited slightly different active sites for the CO2RR. For example, Yuan and co-workers provide bismuth nanosheets dotted with unsaturated pit sites via in situ structural reconstructions of Bi(OH)3NS.89 The mechanistic studies demonstrate that these coordinatively unsaturated sites acting as the real active sites favor the stabilization of the key intermediate *OCHO. Fu and co-workers provided a scalable chemical interface confinement reduction method for the topotactic transformation of BiOBr (001) nanosheets to metallic Bi (001) porous nanosheets.110 The high selectivity and activity of formate formation on the Bi PNS are attributed to the selectively exposed (001) surface and small-angle grain boundaries of Bi PNS, which reduce the free energy barrier for *OCHO formation. However, the Bi-oxide-based catalyst-derived nanosheets could in situ form a Bi–O active site, which is the same as that observed for the Bi-based catalysts with a nanobelt structure. For example, Wang and co-workers reported a bismuth phosphate (BiPO4) derived 2D Bi/Bi2O3 nanosheet-like electrocatalyst.91In situ generation of Bi–O active species on the surface of the catalyst was demonstrated via operando Raman, which can enhance the selectivity of formate (Fig. 12e). Liu and co-workers also reported that the stable isolated ultrasmall bismuth nanosheets with Bi–O active sites improve the selectivity of formate.99 In a word, the nanobelt or nanosheet structure will expose more Bi–O active sites, which can improve the performance of the catalyst.
In addition, metal dopants or bimetallics can lower the energy barrier of HCOO* formation on the Bi site, contributing to enhanced selectivity of formate. For example, Li and co-workers reported Sn-doped111 and Ce-doped Bi2O3 (ref. 112) nanosheets, where a strong synergistic effect was proposed between Sn and Bi enhancing the adsorption capacity of the OCHO* intermediate. Liu and co-workers reported a two-dimensional monolayer Bi2WO6 with high bismuth exposure.106 The mechanistic investigation further elucidates in operando phase transition to a “metallic intermediate state” on monolayer Bi2WO6 during the electrocatalytic process. Guo et al. introduced Ag on the Bi2O2CO3 support, where H* can be migrated from Ag to Bi and facilitate the performance of formate. The authors also coupled the CO2RR with glycerol instead of the OER and reduced the electric energy. Li and co-workers achieved an Sn–Bi/SnO2 surface by in situ formation on the Bi0.1Sn alloy, which can stabilize the CO2 to formate pathway over 2400 h at −100 mA cm−2 current density.101 The performed experimental studies as well as computational investigations show that the stabilized active sites offer near-optimal binding energy to the key intermediate *OCHO. The results demonstrated that metal dopants or bimetallics could form a synergistic effect, which contributes to proton transfer and optimal binding energy of intermediates on the surface of the catalyst.
Similar to In-based and Sn-based catalysts, different supports could modify the selectivity of Bi-based catalysts, especially the carbon-based support, which has an excellent electron transfer rate and adjustable hydrophobicity. Liu and co-workers reported Bi2O3 nanosheets grown on carbon nanofibers with inherent hydrophobicity.93 Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the hydrophobic carbon surface can repel water molecules to form a robust solid–liquid–gas triple-phase boundary and a concentrated CO2 layer, contributing to improved selectivity. Jiang and co-workers combined Bi nanospheres with superhydrophobic porous carbon nanosheets to construct the three-phase interface.113 The thermodynamic ΔG values of the initial electron transfer decreased from 0.37 to 0.07 eV and from 0.42 to 0.11 eV on Bi (012) and Bi (110), respectively. Finally, the surface of the catalyst is enriched with activated *CO2−. Zhang and co-workers synthesized a self-supported large-size 3D porous conductive network of bismuthene (Bi-ene-NW) as an electrocatalytic membrane.95 It was ultrastable to continuously operate for over 500 h at high current density, which contributed to the abundantly accessible sites with high intrinsic activity, multiple interconnected channels, and superior conductivity for mass/charge transport (Fig. 13a and b). Wang and co-workers embedded Bi nanoparticles in pyrrolic-N-dominated doped carbon nanosheets, which promoted electron transfer from N to Bi atoms and facilitated stabilization of the *OCHO intermediate.114 Yang and co-workers designed atomically dispersed Bi clusters supported on hollow carbon spheres (BiC/HCS), which show that the atomic-level Bi clusters enable high CO2 adsorption and stabilized the key *HCOO intermediate with a low free energy barrier.115 The catalyst supported by carbon-based materials could enhance the electron transfer from carbon to the catalyst surface, leading to stabilization of the key intermediates.

Metal oxides can also be a support to modify the electronic structure of Bi-based catalysts. For example, Duan and co-workers provide a bismuth/cerium oxide (Bi/CeOx) catalyst, which was derived from amorphous Bi2O2CO3/CeOx.116 The Bi-metal is present as Bi0 during CO2 measurement, and Ce is present in mixed states of Ce3+ and Ce4+. The authors proposed that the high selectivity was improved due to more delocalization of the partial density of states for surface Bi atoms on Bi/CeOx, facilitating the bonding between the catalyst and adsorbate (Fig. 13c and d). Besides, they proposed that the COOH* is preferable to be formed on CeOx and leads to the formation of CO. Therefore, the surface Bi atoms are the actual active sites for HCOOH production (Fig. 13e). CeOx can strengthen the adsorption of HCOO*. Besides, amorphous CeOx has a higher ratio of Ce3+:Ce4+ than CeOx. The more abundant unsaturated coordination of the amorphous phase and the higher content of low-coordinated Ce3+ in CeOx may promote the formation of more Bi active sites with much smaller particle sizes. 2D metal–organic-framework (MOF)-based composites have emerged as promising candidates for electrocatalysis due to their high structural flexibility and fully exposed active sites. Liu and co-workers reported a freestanding Zr-TATB MOL as a support with a tetragonal Bi2O3 nanowire catalyst.92 They revealed that the high electron transfer on Zr-TATB MOL led to enhanced performance of Bi2O3. Li and co-workers demonstrated that abundant Bi active sites existed in crystallographic channels of the MOF structure, leading to enhanced HCOO* formation.117 Combined with the carbon support strategy, accelerated charge transfer to the catalyst surface would stabilize key intermediates and promote the catalytic reaction rate.
In summary, lots of studies demonstrated that the Bi–O or the Bi-based oxide catalyst is the active site. Nanostructures, such as nanobelts or nanosheets, exhibited more edge sites and Bi–O sites to improve the performance of the Bi-based catalyst. The carbon-based support could modify the electron transfer from the support to the active site. And the metal oxides changed the electronic environment of the Bi-site, contributing to enhanced formate selectivity. Besides, the formate selectivity of Bi2S3 nanorods was explored at a different temperature, which provides a new strategy to improve the performance of the catalysts.118


4.3.2 Stability. 
Due to lots of studies concentrated on Bi-based catalysts, there are different electrolytes and the electronic cell was discussed. As shown in Fig. 14a, most catalysts exhibited <50 h stability at current density >−200 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH in the flow cell.87,88,90,94,98,99,103,105-107 Among them, the Bi2S3-derived catalyst showed 100 h stability at −250 mA cm−2 current density.107 Compared with different electrolytes, the Sn–Bi/SnO2/Bi0.1Sn catalyst performed 2400 h in pH 11 electrolyte (1 M KHCO3 to 10 M KOH) at −100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 14b).97,101,104,107 This result also demonstrated that the pH value of the electrolyte is a key factor in the stability performance. Except for the electrolyte, MEA can also be used to mitigate the carbonate formation during the long-term test (Fig. 14c).101,107,108 However, the stability performance was further improved in both the flow cell and MEA. And the pH value and cell structure needed to be optimized during the long-term CO2RR.

4.4 
          In situ analysis techniques for mechanism studies
To understand the active site and intermediate on the surface of the catalyst during the electrochemical CO2RR, various in situ/operando characterization techniques emerge as powerful tools. In this section, in situ attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR), operando Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy were discussed for deepening the understanding of the mechanism of formate production on In, Sn, and Bi-based catalysts.
ATR-IR was used to analyze the surface of the nanostructure electrode, which has the advantages of low interference of solution background signal and unimpeded mass transfer. It is more conducive to obtaining the adsorption structure and reaction dynamics information of the electrode/solution interface under electrochemical conditions. The Andrew B. Bocarsly group studied the oxide state and intermediate on the surface of In, Sn, and Bi-based catalysts by in situ ATR-IR technology during the CO2RR, and then proposed the reaction mechanism(Fig. 15a–c).26,27,119 Combined with CV measurement results in Ar and CO2-saturated 0.5 M K2SO4, they proposed that the In2O3 coupled with protons forms In(OH)3, which is not redox-active.26 Then, CO2 inserts in In(OH)3 forming active carbonate adsorbed on the In surface and be reduced to formate. The reaction mechanism of the Sn-based catalyst is similar to that of the In-based material, which was verified by in situ ATR-IR technology.27 However, the Bi-based catalyst is different from Sn and In, where bismuth electrodes are fully reduced to the metal under the same conditions certified by in situ ATR-IR.119 The authors concluded that both the reduction of H+ to H2 and the reduction of CO2 to formate occur at metallic bismuth sites at the electrode surface, and CO2 is reduced directly on the bare metallic surface of bismuth.

In 1973, Fleischmann et al. first applied Raman spectroscopy to the study of electrochemical systems. And then surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy has been developed. The state of the electrochemical system is changed by changing the potential to obtain Raman spectra. By analyzing the variation of the frequency and intensity of the characteristic peaks in the Raman spectrum with the potential, the information on the analytical structure, surface coverage, adsorption orientation, interface composition, and morphology was obtained. Recently, Abhijit Dutta and co-workers studied the sub-carbonate formation and oxidation of Bi2O3 before and during the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) by operando Raman spectroscopy(Fig. 15g).30 They monitored the gradual transition of the formed carbonate/oxide composite catalyst into its fully metallic state by operando Raman spectroscopy as a function of electrolysis time and applied potential, which was correlated with changes in FEformate. Finally, they provide two distinct reaction pathways of formate formation in the aqueous CO2-sat. 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte, which is active on (i) the partly reduced Bi2O3 foam at low overpotentials (sub-carbonate pathway) and (ii) on the corresponding metallic Bimet foam catalyst at medium and high overpotentials (Bi–O pathway). Wang and co-workers also proposed the in situ generations of the Bi–O active species on the BiPO4 catalyst surface via operando Raman measurement.91

Operando XAS measurements were performed to provide the oxidation state and local structure of metal-based catalysts during the CO2RR. Gong and co-workers carried out operando XAS measurements at the Bi L-edge, demonstrating that Bi2O3 NTs are reduced to metallic Bi before the CO2RR (Fig. 15d–f).120 The presence of the Bi–O scattering paths from the EXAFS fitting can be reasonably assigned to chemisorbed *OH and *OCHO (intermediate to formate) species. More importantly, the CN of Bi–Bi is smaller than that of Bi metal foil, evidenced by the presence of abundant defects or vacancies in our material under the actual working conditions.
There are other in situ technologies for the CO2RR. For example, Feng and co-workers found that the as-synthesized Bi2O3/BiO2 heterostructure can be transformed into a novel Bi/BiO2 Mott–Schottky heterostructure by both X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy measurements.109 Tsujiguchi and co-workers performed SECCM measurements to investigate the direct link between the local configurations of Sn/rGO and the CO2 reduction activity.121
5 Photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction to formate based on solar cell devices
Coupled with renewable clean energy, such as solar energy, forming a photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction system is a desirable route to product formation. The solar-driven CO2 reduction system can be divided into three types of structure: PV-EC,122–124 PEC,125,126 and PV-PEC.127 With the rapid development of photovoltaic devices, a lot of research was developed for CO2 reduction. Herein, we will discuss solar cell-driven CO2 reduction to formate devices.
PV-EC is a simple system, which was reported in 2014 for the first time. The Andrew B. Bocarsly group achieved thermionic solar CO2 reduction to formate energy conversion efficiency (η) of 1.8% by using an integrated silicon PV electrolyzer system.128 Due to the low FE of formate and high potential of CO2 reduction to formate, the conversion efficiency was limited. Then in 2016, the Nathan S. Lewis and Chengxiang Xiang groups reported a TiO2-protected III–V tandem photoanode coupled with CO2 reduction.124 The energy-conversion efficiency of solar-driven CO2 reduction to formate reached 10% (Fig. 16a). In 2020, Naohiko Kato et al. designed a large-scale solar-driven CO2 to formate system with 1 m2 and 1000 cm2; the conversion efficiency was 10.5% and 7.2% respectively (Fig. 16b).129

Compared with the PV-EC system, the integrated PEC devices can overcome a potential drop due to various resistances (resistances in the solar cell, between the solar cell and the electrode, and permeance at the proton exchange membrane). In 2015, Takeo Arai et al. designed a monolithic device for CO2 photoreduction to generate formate, which achieved a solar-to-formate conversion efficiency of 4.6% (Fig. 16c).130 They choose a porous ruthenium complex polymer (p-RuCP) as a CO2 reduction catalyst, iridium oxide (IrOx) as a water oxidation catalyst, and a triple-junction of amorphous silicon-germanium (SiGe-jn) as a light absorber. Here, IrOx was chosen as an anode catalyst due to the poor activity for the formate reoxidized at the anode electrode, which can avoid formate formation in the cathode to be oxidized in the anode.
6 Summary and outlook
This review summarized and underlined the progress in post-transition metal block-based catalysts for photoelectrochemical and electrochemical conversion of CO2 to formate. Due to the unique surface OH functional group adsorption or formation characteristics of the In, Sn, and Bi metals, two different mechanisms were proposed. In addition, the CO2 reduction to formate involving only a two-electron reaction path was considered as the economically feasible carbon dioxide emission reduction scheme. However, there is still a large gap from the laboratory platform to commercial application for CO2RR to formate technology. To accelerate the realization of commercial applications, formate selectivity, stability, and solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency associated with the OER replacement reaction are highlighted by the following key points:

First, improving the catalyst selectivity at ampere level

Recently, most catalysts achieved the faradaic efficiency of formate > 90% at current density < −100 mA cm−2. However, there are few catalysts with a current density exceeding −500 mA cm−2 still obtaining more than 90% Faraday efficiency of formic acid. And there are few highly active catalysts reaching the ampere level. The reason is that metal oxides will be reduced to corresponding metal at more negative potential, leading to (1) reduction of the active state, (2) nanostructure destroyed. Although some published studies showed that the metal site was the active site after reduction, the nanostructure was also achieved to expose more active sites. Herein, it is also significant to explore new strategies to maintain the oxidative active state or nanostructure active sites of the catalyst. For example, the electronic structure and coordination environment of the active center would be regulated by mixed metal oxides. According to the mechanism of the formate formation, strengthening the O atom adsorbed on the active center by tuning the type, proportion, and valence of the mixed metal oxides would enhance the OHCO* intermediate formation and suppress the *COOH formation, leading to improved selectivity of formate.

Second, enhancing the stability of the catalysts

Stability is a key factor in commercial applications. In practice, longer stability can reduce the high-cost problem caused by catalyst replacement. Recently, it has been shown that the stability can be maintained above 100 h at a current density < −200 mA cm−2. And the longest time can reach 2400 h at −100 mA cm−2. An excessively high overpotential is required and electrode stability tends to be poor over time due to a more negative shift of the current density. The reason for the degradation is similar to the activity decline of the selectivity. Besides, GDE flooding is another factor in degradation during long-term stability tests. Some studies use KHCO3 instead of KOH or use MEA instead of the flow cell to mitigate the carbonate formation during the stability test. However, the stability is still < 100 h at a current density > −200 mA cm−2. Therefore, more stable GDE and nanostructure catalysts need to be developed to improve the stability. Besides, the type of electrolyte also is another key factor needed to be considered. For example, the reasonable design of a hydrophobic layer between the electrolyte and catalyst or the catalyst and GDE can avoid the flooding of GDE, leading to enhanced stability in the future.

Third, improving the conversion efficiency in PV-EV or PEC

The conversion efficiency of solar-to-formate is lower than that of solar-to-hydrogen, which need to be further improved in the future. And the limiting factor is the high potential of CO2 to formate requirements. Increasing the performance at lower potential, or replacing the anodic OER with organic oxidation could provide strategies to reduce the required potential, which can reduce the requirements for the performance of photovoltaic devices and further improve the conversion efficiency.

Last, in situ analysis techniques

Although these published studies have achieved results proving the reaction mechanism path, lots of in situ technologies were operated at more positive than the potential with higher performance. If effective signals can be observed at more negative voltage, it will be a powerful tool for catalyst performance regulation at lower current density. Therefore, we need to design new cells or electrode structures to promote the development of in situ analysis techniques. In combination with DFT, more information on in situ reaction mechanisms can be obtained in the future.
