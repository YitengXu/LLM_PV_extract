    , Accepted 13th March 2020First published on 14th March 2020AbstractThe toxicity of lead has inspired recent interest in making lead-free photovoltaic materials, among which the bimetallic double perovskite (DP) strategy is very promising. Unlike the popular Ag(I)–Bi(III) based DPs with wider band gaps ∼2.0 eV, in our previous study we found that the Cu(I)–Bi(III) method may have narrower band gaps ∼1.6 eV. Here we expand this strategy to various amines, from which we can see that the cyclic aliphatic amines (CAAs) are critical to govern the structural dimensions, thin film orientations and band gaps of the Cu(I)–Bi(III) iodide DPs. Among these compounds, CAAs with a “Z-shape” and six-member-rings result in two-dimensional structures (compounds 1–5), while CAAs with a “C-shape” and five-member-rings result in 1D bimetallic chains (compounds 6 and 7). Regardless of the structural dimensions, all seven compounds show narrow band gaps between 1.53 and 1.67 eV, which can be correlated to the distortions of the Cu–I–Bi angles. The band gap will be narrower if the Cu–I–Bi angle is closer to 180° or the octahedral distortion is smaller. Moreover, DFT calculations reveal that such band gaps are flat and direct in nature. Interestingly, the thin films formed by these compounds show preferential orientations to the ITO substrate with respect to the symmetries of the amines. For mirror-symmetric diamines the inorganic layers tend to be perpendicular to ITO; for asymmetric diamines the inorganic layers tend to be randomly oriented on ITO; for the asymmetric mono-amines the inorganic layers tend to be parallel to ITO. Such a phenomenon is, as far as we know, unknown to the field of perovskite thin film construction. To further reveal the potential of these materials for photovoltaic application we took compound 3 as a representative to study the photoelectric properties. From 20 °C to 130 °C, the conductivity of compound 3 increases over five orders of magnitude, ramping from 3.97 × 10−10 S cm−1 to 2.78 × 10−5 S cm−1, indicating a formal semiconducting behaviour. Thus, the photo-current response experiments show a ca. 17.5 nA difference between Ilight and Idark for 3, indicating the potential application of this material for light harvesting.
Introduction
The research on inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite materials has been increasing since 2009 when MAPbI3 was found to show promising photo-current responses for solar cell application.1–4 To date, the power conversion efficiency of the perovskite solar cells has reached 25.2%.2–4 However the toxicity of lead is becoming an increasing concern for our fragile environment.5,6 To replace lead using single divalent metal ions (e.g. Ge2+, Sn2+) appears difficult and highly costly due to the chemical instability of Sn2+ and Ge2+.7–9 In contrast, the double perovskite (DP) strategy offers more choices beyond divalent metal ions. It combines metal ions with different valence states, like M4+/M0,10–12 M3+/M1+,13–15 and M2+/M2+,16 which greatly increases the variety of perovskite structures.
In recent years, many metal ions have been incorporated into hybrid DP structures, such as AuIAuIII,17,18 KIBiIII,14 AgIBiIII,19–21 TlIBiIII,22 AgISbIII,23 KIYIII,24 KIGdIII,24etc. However, these compounds are mainly chlorides and bromides with band gaps wider than 2.0 eV which are not suitable even for tandem solar cells. Iodides are expected to show narrower band gaps. In particular, first-principle calculations indicate that Bi/Cu iodide DPs would show promising optoelectronic properties with narrow band gaps and low carrier effective masses.22,25,26
Since 2001 researchers have devoted much effort to incorporate Bi3+ and Cu+ into hybrid halide coordination polymers. For example, Feldmann et al. reported CuBi7I19(C4H8O3H)3(C4H8O3H2) which contains 1D [CuBi5I19]n3n+ chains and organobismuth cation templates [Bi2(C4H8O3H)3(C4H8O3H2)]3+;27 and Chen et al. used Et4N+ or Cu(CH3CN)4+ as templates to synthesize two 1D Bi/Cu iodide coordination polymers with band gaps below 1.9 eV.28 Moreover, several 0D CuBi halide complexes with Bu4N+, PPh4+ cations or PPh3 molecules as the template have also been reported.29,30 However, in these reported 0D and 1D compounds, CuI units share edges or faces with BiI units rather than corners, and the shapes of the cations or molecular templates are equiaxed and spherical-like. Thus, these compounds do not adopt perovskite structures. Besides, an inorganic 3D coordination polymer CuBiI4 has also been reported. A wide band gap (2.67 eV) solar cell based on this material shows 0.82% PCE and a long-term stability.31–33
In order to synthesize CuBi iodide DPs with higher dimensions and narrower band gaps, the organic templates should be carefully selected to support the corner-sharing pattern between CuI6 and BiI6 octahedra. For example, the organic templates at A sites of the ABX3 halide perovskite structure should not be larger than 2.3 Å in the iodide case. Even using cations with suitable sizes, 3D CuBi iodide DPs are still unreached targets. Only one case of a 2D CuBi iodide DP has been reported by some of us by using the 1,4-cyclohexanediamine as template.34 but the systematic regulations are not studied.
In this article, we expand this cyclic aliphatic amine (CAA) strategy to other amines with various symmetry and cyclic rings using “Z-shape” hexa-member-ring CAAs; compounds 1–5 which share the common formulae of [(CAA)nCuBiI8] (for n = 2, CAA = 1,3-diaminocyclohexane 1 and CAA = 1-methylpiperidin-4-amine 2; for n = 4, CAA = cyclohexylamine 3, CAA = cycloheptylamine 4 and CAA = cyclooctylamine 5) have been isolated. These five compounds contain a similar inorganic layer of [CuBiI8]n4n− pillared by disparate amines. While using “C-shape” five-member-ring CAAs of cyclopentylamine, compounds [(CAA)10CuBi3I20] 6 and [(CAA)7CuBi2I14] 7 possessing 1D bimetallic chains are isolated. These total seven compounds show optical band gaps ranging from 1.53 eV to 1.67 eV, which can be correlated to the distortions of the Cu–I–Bi angles. We found that the band gap will be narrower if the Cu–I–Bi angle is closer to 180° or the octahedral distortion is smaller. More importantly, 2D compounds 1–5 can be made into films through the spin coating method, and the films' orientations to the ITO substrate show strong amine-dependence with respect to the symmetries of the amines. For the mirror-symmetric diamine (1,3-diaminocyclohexane) the inorganic layers tend to be perpendicular to ITO; for the asymmetric diamine (1-methylpiperidin-4-amine) the inorganic layers tend to be randomly oriented on ITO; for the asymmetric mono-amines (cyclohexylamine, cycloheptylamine and cyclooctylamine) the inorganic layers tend to be parallel to ITO. Such a phenomenon is, as far as we know, unknown to the field of perovskite thin film construction. Furthermore, conductivity studies under different temperatures, photocurrent measurements with xenon lamp irradiation and DFT calculations were carried out, suggesting the potential for optoelectronic applications of these materials.
Results and discussion
Syntheses
The majority of the reported hybrid 2D DPs use linear aliphatic amines (LAA) as templates, such as C8N2H22+,18 C7N2H20+, and18 C4NH12+.19 Compared with bulky templates, they have slim shapes with one long axis and two other short axes. These LAAs support the 2D layers into 3D structures in the direction of the long axis, while not breaking the continuity of the inorganic DP layer in the directions of the two short axes. However, the linear-template strategy has not been successfully applied in CuIBiIII DP preparation because mono-metallic products are produced by using LAAs or simple monocyclic aromatic amines.
We recently reported the first 2D CuBi DP (C6N2H16)2CuBiI8·0.5H2O using a 1,4-cyclohexanediamine (14CDA) as a template to self-assemble the inorganic part into the DP structure.34 To extend this CAA approach, we systematically studied the influence of the number of atoms in the aliphatic ring ranging from four to eight on the products. The crystal of the CuBi bi-metallic halide cannot be formed when the number is no more than four, while 1D and 2D compounds can be formed when the numbers are five and no less than six, respectively. For compounds 1–5, the cyclic parts of the amines comprise more than or exactly six atoms. From the side views (Fig. 1), the amines show well zigzag structures (‘Z’-shape), containing four or five folding segments. Thus, the CAAs are not even but undulating like the egg trough, which may easily pile up. In contrast, the side view of the cyclopentylamine in compounds 7 and 8 shows a ‘C’-shape conformation, formed by three folding segments. The 3D view of this template looks like a spoon, which does not fit into the 2D structure, so the ribbon-like 1D chains form instead.
 Fig. 1  Compounds 1–5 with “Z-shape” amines possess 2D DP structures and compounds 6 and 7 with “C-shape” amines possess 1D DP structures. The six cyclic aliphatic amines used are illustrated in the front view and side view. 
Crystal structures
The crystal structures of 1–7 are shown in Fig. 2, S1 and S3–S9† and the crystallographic data are listed in Table S1–S4.† In general, compounds 1–5 have similar inorganic anions of 2D [CuBiI8]n4n−. In contrast, compounds 6 and 7 have 1D chains of [CuBi3I20]n10n− and [CuBi2I14]n7n−.

(d) Inorganic chains of 6 and 7 isolated from the 2D CuBiI sheet with cyclopentylamine, and 3D packing view of 6 and 7. Violet, gray, turquoise, blue and white spheres represent I, Bi, Cu, N, and C atoms, respectively. 
Compounds 1–5 can be further divided into two sub-classes. 1 and 2 use diamines as the templates, which can be sorted as class I. The two amino groups at the two ends of the diamines are protonated and carry positive charges. Hence, the negatively charged [CuBiI8]n4n− inorganic layers are electrostatically attracted by the amines. As seen in the packing plots (Fig. 2b and S1†), the metal atoms are layered in an ‘eclipsed’ mode with respect to the adjacent layers' metal ions.35 If compared to the previously reported (14CDA)2CuBiI8,34 where the inorganic layers are packed in an ‘AAAA’ fashion, the layers in compounds 1 and 2 (Fig. 2b) are packed in a ‘ABAB’ configuration. The Bi–I bond lengths in 1 are in the range of 3.0592(19)–3.090(3) Å, indicating almost no distortion of the [BiI6] octahedral geometry. In the [CuI6] octahedron, the lengths of the two apical Cu–Iax bonds (2.482(3) Å) are vertical to the inorganic layer and much shorter than the other four Cu–I distances (3.041(6)–4.020 Å) within the layer (Fig. S3†). The bond angles (I–Cu–I) between the adjacent I atoms in this work are always about 90° and that between the nonadjacent I atoms are usually >160° which is quite different from the classical CuI4 tetrahedron case in the hybrid PbCu iodides.36 This kind of highly distorted octahedron could also be seen in GeI based perovskites8 and AuAuI 2D double perovskites.18 For 2, the [BiI6] octahedron with Bi–I bond distances of 3.0778(12)–3.0890(15) Å is similar to those of 1 while for the [CuI6] octahedron, the apical Cu–Iax bonds (2.5301(17) Å) are longer compared to those of 1, while the four equatorial Cu–I distances are more distorted, ranging from 2.928(3) Å to 4.302 Å (Fig. S4†).
In addition to the diammonium compounds (1 and 2), monoammonium can also stabilize the layered perovskite structures in compounds 3–5 (Fig. 2c, S1 and S5–S7†). But for the charge balance requirement the organic layer consists of two sublayers of monoamines. The amino groups of the organic amines face the inorganic layer and the alkyl tails face outwards, similar to the double-layer structure of the lipid. Thus, the inorganic layer is sandwiched by two organic amino layers, forming a neutral structure. The tails of amines between the layers interact with each other only by van der Waals force. To minimize the potential energy, adjacent layers are ‘staggered’ in these compounds (Fig. 2c). The [BiI6] octahedron in 3 is more distorted with Bi–I bond lengths ranging from 3.0677(7) Å to 3.1112(7) Å while for the [CuI6] octahedron, the lengths of the two Cu–Iax bonds are asymmetric, namely 2.470(3) Å and 2.578 Å, and the four equatorial Cu–I distances are also distorted with Cu–I distances ranging from 2.750(3) Å to 4.497 Å. For 4, the [BiI6] octahedron is even more distorted with Bi–I bond lengths ranging from 3.015(2) Å to 3.131(2) Å, but the [CuI6] octahedron shows the two Cu–Iax bond lengths of 2.458(5) Å and 2.495(5) Å and four Cu–Ieq distances ranging from 2.851(6) Å to 4.103 Å. For 5, the Bi–I bond lengths (3.029(5)–3.164(6) Å) are similar to that of 4, while the [CuI6] octahedron with two Cu–Iax bonds of 2.443(6) Å and 2.453(6) Å and four Cu–Ieq distances ranging from 2.966(9) Å to 4.127 Å is more similar to that in 1.
When a smaller ‘C’ shaped CAA (the cyclopentylamine) was used, 1D compounds 6 and 7 were obtained. Their inorganic parts exhibit 1D chain structures. The side view of the packing plot of the chains in Fig. 2d are step-like. Each inorganic chain forms one step, and the steps form a disconnected inorganic layer, and then the inorganic layers are separated by organic layers. In 6, the [BiI6] octahedron is much distorted with the Bi–I bond lengths ranging from 3.004(4) to 3.319(3) Å; while the [CuI6] octahedron is much less distorted with two Cu–Iax bonds of 2.415(2) Å and four Cu–Ieq distances of 3.398(2)–3.508(3) Å. Four bismuth iodide octahedra are connected to each CuI octahedron in a plane, extending into a 1D chain with a Cu:Bi ratio of 1:3. If the starting ratio of Cu:Bi in the precursors is changed from 1:1 to 1.5:1, compound 7 was isolated. The arrangement of organic amines in 7 is similar to those in 6, but an interesting change was that the ratio of Cu:Bi in the inorganic chain is increased to 1:2, leading to a wider ribbon-like chain. The coordination geometry of the [BiI6] octahedron in 7 is also quite distorted with the Bi–I bond lengths ranging from 2.9651(8) Å to 3.2953(9) Å, similar to that in 6. But the [CuI6] octahedron is much more distorted with two Cu–Iax bonds of 2.483(4) and 2.486(4) Å and four Cu–Ieq distances ranging from 2.887(4) Å to 4.329 Å.
Because Cu+ is small and favourable to the tetrahedron coordination mode to maintain the energetically unfavourable vertex-sharing octahedra in the DP structure, additional force to offset the energy deficit is necessitated, which renders the critical role of the cationic amines for shaping the inorganic components. Compared with bulky amines such as Bu4N+ and PPh4+,27–29 we found that CAAs have some unique functions to shape the 2D CuBi iodide DP structures. CAAs are quite small in three dimensions, so they can pack closely. Compared with linear aliphatic amines (LAAs),18,19 the structure of CAAs can be considered as combining two LAAs at both ends. This makes CAAs more rigid and able to support the inorganic layers.
Moreover, the zigzag structure of CAAs also provides some elasticity, which may help to release the stress. We reason that as the number of atoms in the CAA ring decreases, the amines become more rigid and gradually lose the ability to maintain the [CuBiI8]n4n− layer, like cyclopentylamine (five atoms in the ring) forming 1D structures and cyclobutanamine (four atoms in the ring) forming nothing after the reaction. More importantly, this subtle variation of the inorganic components, especially the variation of the Cu–I–Bi connection angles, induced by the organic cations results in the variation of the band gaps.
Amine-dependent thin film orientations
Compounds 1–7 are highly soluble in DMF. 1 mL DMF can dissolve more than 1 g of solid. By spin coating 0.5 g mL−1 DMF solutions of these compounds on glass or ITO substrates and annealing on the top of a hot plate at 70 °C, smooth films of compounds 1–7 can be readily formed (Fig. 3, S11 and S12†). From PXRD analysis we conclude that the films of compounds 1–5 could maintain their former structures after solution processes, while 1D compounds 6 and 7 could not be recrystallized back. The orientation of the polycrystal in the thin films with respect to the substrate was studied. It is apparent that the films of 1 and 3–5 show dominant crystal planes, while compound 2 shows no dominated orientation. The 2D inorganic layer of the film 1 is perpendicular to the substrate, while the layers of 3, 4 and 5 are parallel to the substrate. Fig. 3a shows peaks at (00−2), (00−4), (020), and (040) of compound 1, which are all perpendicular to the inorganic DP layer and parallel to the substrate (illustrated in Fig. 3d). Therefore, the DP layer is perpendicular to the substrate in the film of 1.

(f, g and h) Illustrations of electrostatic and van der Waals interactions among the components in 1 and 2 and 3–5 types of structures respectively. 
The spectrum of film 3 gives the dominant diffraction peak of (00−2). Other peaks appear regularly at (00−4), (00−6), etc., and they are all parallel to (00−2). The orientation relationship is illustrated in Fig. 3e, which shows that those planes are all parallel to the inorganic layer and the substrate; so the DP layers are parallel to the substrate. The spectra of 4 and 5 are consistent with those of 3 (Fig. 3c). The dominant planes are also parallel to the substrates. The shifts among the three spectra indicate the different distances between inorganic layers while the spectrum of 2 shows a random arrangement.
Orientation preferences could be influenced by many factors, such as solvent, surfactant, and surface treatment of substrates, but they all work to influence the relative crystallization speed of certain crystal planes.37,38 In this system, we reason that the orientations are mainly determined by organic amines. They could be divided into three types according to the shapes and the charge distributions which directly lead to three types of forces in the crystallization process. Different force types determine the crystallization speeds and further dominate crystal faces.37 Eventually, the films show three types of orientations. The 1,3-diaminocyclohexane in compound 1 connects to inorganic layers in both its ends by electrostatic interaction (Fig. 3f). The strong connection makes the growth along (020) and (00−2) planes easy, leading to the perpendicular structure while for 2, it's a little different in that the charge distribution of the template is not so equal on both sides. The distance between the tertiary amine ‘NH+–’ and the inorganic layer is larger than that between the primary amine ‘–NH3+’ and the inorganic layer. Since the electrostatic force is inversely proportional to the square of distance, unequal distances lead to unequal forces, see Fig. 3g. Unequal electrostatic force makes the growing speed perpendicular to the planes imbalanced and makes the crystal growth random. As a result, no priority orientation is observed. In the cases of 3, 4 and 5, organic templates only have positive charge on one side. On this side, organic templates connect to the inorganic layer by electrostatic interaction, while on the other side, the aliphatic rings come in contact with other rings by much weaker van der Waals forces. In consequence, the crystal growth perpendicular to the inorganic layer is slowed down. Eventually the parallel type could be observed. As such, the symmetry or the polarity of the amines regulates the film orientations.
The various kinds of film orientations may enable this kind of CuBiI DPs to be apply in different types of devices. In general, metal halide inorganic parts have better electron conductivity than organic parts, which will cause anisotropy. Such regulatable anisotropy in CuBi DP films may meet the large requirements in applications. For field effect transistors, the parallel type can help transfer electrons between the source and the drain along the film. For solar cells, the perpendicular type can help transfer the charge carrier between front and rear contacts across the film.
Optical properties
The UV-vis diffuse reflectance data of solid-state 1–7 were measured and converted to optical band gaps by using the Kubelka–Munk function (Fig. 4a). The band gaps of 1–7 are indicated by sharp absorption edges between 1.53 eV and 1.67 eV, which are comparable to that of the 2D Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 (n = 4, 1.6 eV, 15.4% PCE)39 and much lower than that of 3D DP Cs2AgBiBr6 (2.17 eV, 2.4% PCE).15 And at room temperature, they all show weak PL peaks (Fig. 4a) between 764.1 nm and 768.0 nm corresponding to the UV results.

A UV-vis spectrometer determined the band gaps of the powder samples (red columns); DFT simulated band gaps (blue columns); a UV-vis spectrometer measured absorption onsets of film samples (green columns). 
The band gaps of 1–5 are very close because of the common nature of the inorganic frameworks. In general, the lower dimension in the perovskite family indicates the wider band gap. However, the band gaps of 1D 6 and 7 are among those of 1–5. Although the overall structures of 6 and 7 are different from compounds 1–5, the type of the octahedral connection is still similar. Meanwhile, the stacking ways of the chains in 6 and 7 are very dense, which also contributes to their narrow band gaps. Though similar, the band gaps of 1–5 are not the same, but vary in a range between 1.53 eV and 1.67 eV. The relationships between band gaps and crystal structures have been well studied for mono-metal hybrid perovskites.40–42 But for the more complex hybrid double perovskites, the relationships are still not developed.
Since the organic components generally do not contribute to the electron orbitals near the band gap, the subtle variations in the spatial arrangement of the inorganic layers, including interlayer distance and intralayer distortion are the decisive factors. The interlayer distances of compounds 1–5 are 9.71 Å, 9.38 Å, 13.27 Å, 14.13 Å, and 15.41 Å, respectively (Fig. S13a†). Since diamine compounds 1 and 2 consist of only one layer of organic amines, their interlayer space is much smaller than that of monoamine-containing compounds 3, 4 and 5. Hence, the band gaps of 1 and 2 (1.53–1.55 eV) are about 0.1 eV smaller than those of 3, 4 and 5 (1.61–1.65 eV). From the previous discussion we can see that the [BiI6] octahedra in all compounds are slightly distorted, while the equatorial Cu–Ieq distances vary considerably, which is believed to be the decisive factor for the formation of corner-sharing Cu–Bi octahedra. Hence, the angle of Cu–I–Bi can be used to measure the intralayer distortion. The Cu–I–Bi bond angles of 1–5 are 164.3°, 169.3°, 159.6°, 164.8°, and 163.4°, respectively (Fig. S13b†). The band gap will be narrower if the Cu–I–Bi angle is closer to 180° or the octahedral distortion is smaller. For example, 3 has the smallest angle 159.6°, which indicates the largest distortion, and the largest band gap (1.65 eV) in this series (inset of Fig. 4a). In contrast, 2 has the smallest octahedral distortion, 169.3°, and its band gap is the smallest (1.53 eV). This result is consistent with previous reports for hybrid mono-metal perovskites.40,43 Considering the major contribution of inorganic components, the [CuBiI8]n4n− layers set a keynote for the band gaps of 1–5 varying in a small range of 0.12 eV. But at the same time, organic cations undeniably play a role in regulating the band gap. This regulation plays an indirect role, which might work through maintaining distances between layers or distorting the inorganic layers.
DFT calculations
The DFT calculations for the band structures and partial density of states (PDOS) of compounds 1–7 were performed (see the Computational methods and Fig. S14 in the ESI†) to study the composition and character of the electron structure near the band gap. We found that all compounds show flat band gap structures. 2D compounds 1–5 show band gaps between 1.81 and 2.01 eV, which are well consistent with the experimental results. If compared to the bulk, the thin film samples have similar band gaps to the calculated values. What's more, in all compounds, valence band maximums (VBMs) are made of Cu-d and I-p orbitals while conduction band minimums (CBMs) are made of Bi-p plus I-p orbitals. Here below we take compound 3 as a representative to discuss. Compared to the fluctuant band structures of Pb based perovskites, the relatively flat conductive band of 3 (Fig. 4d) may put some obstacles to the transport of electrons, which might be the explanation of the low conductivity at room temperature (Fig. 5). The predicted band gap of 3 is direct (1.83 eV) at G, just a little (180 meV) higher than the experiment result (1.65 eV). The TDOS of 3 (black line in Fig. 4e) near the band gap (0–1.83 eV) is mainly contributed by the inorganic part (red line), mainly consisting of I-p, Cu-d and Bi-p orbitals. Near 0 eV, the VBM is made of Cu-d and I-p orbitals, while the CBM consists of I-p and Bi-p orbitals. In other words, Cu has no contribution to the CBM and Bi has no contribution to the VBM, which are consistent with previously reported calculation results for layered Cu–Sb44 and Ag–Bi19–21,34 based DPs. Since I− ions have different positions in the crystal structure, we further studied how different I positions influence the electronic band structures. According to the relative position of I to the metal ions, I− ions are divided into three types: (i) the axial I− ions that connects to the Bi atoms (Iax Bi-p), (ii) the axial I− ions that connects to the Cu atoms (Iax Cu-p), and (iii) the equatorial I− ions in the inorganic plane (Ieq-p). According to the projected PDOS of I-p, we conclude that Iax Cu-p and Ieq-p contribute to the VBM, while the CBM consists of Iax Bi-p and Ieq-p. Hence, the overall band gap structure of 3 is dominated by the inorganic components and more like a direct band gap.

Electrical properties
To further demonstrate the semiconducting nature of these materials with narrow band gaps we take compound 3 as a representative to study the temperature-dependent and photo-irradiated electrical conductivities. As shown in Fig. 5a and S15,† the conductivity increases exponentially upon warming, indicating typical semiconductor behaviour. From 20 °C to 130 °C, the conductivity increased over five orders of magnitude, ramping from 3.97 × 10−10 S cm−1 to 2.78 × 10−5 S cm−1, due to the intrinsic excitation which causes the exponential increase of carrier density. For a temperature higher than 130 °C, the conductivity decreased because the lattice vibration scattering overwhelms the increase of carrier density. The photoconductivity of 3 was also measured using pressed-pellet samples with a 3 V bias-voltage (Fig. 5b). Under a dark environment, the current is about 2.5 nA. whereas under the photoexcitation of a xenon lamp, the current increase to about 20 nA, which proves the light-response of 3. The photosensitive conductivity further demonstrates the semiconductor nature of 3 and indicates the possibility of it being a light-harvesting and light-detecting material.
Thermal and humidity stabilities
After the films of 1–5 were kept in a dark constant temperature & humidity incubator at 90% relative humidity for 15 days the color between the fresh and aged films did not show obvious change and the PXRD patterns for films 1–4 showed no evidence of material decomposition (Fig. S17†). But for the film of 5, the PXRD pattern shows some changes. In Fig. S18,† the pattern of the newly fabricated film shows reflection planes of 〈001〉 family. In the inset graph, the expansion of 2θ between 5.3 and 6.7°, shows a small peak appearing on the left and right of the main peak after 1 day of aging, which indicates the decomposition of 5. After 2 days of aging, the small peak on the right of the main peak disappeared, while the peak on the left remained, which means that the right peak probably stands for an intermediate product, and it decomposed after 2 days of aging. Then the decomposition process seemed to stop, since the pattern of 15 days is basically the same as that of two days. The insets are two pictures of the film before and after aging, which display no obvious differences. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) conducted at a scan rate of 10 °C min−1 shows that 1–7 are stable against mass loss up to 230 °C (Fig. S16†).
Conclusions
To summarize, CAAs with more than six atoms in the aliphatic rings are able to support layered CuBi DP structures. With a smaller cyclic ring the cyclopentylamine, it can only lead to the formation of 1D CuBi iodide DP structures. Moreover, CAAs can also fine tune the band gaps of the compounds by varying the interlayer distances and the Cu–I–Bi angles. The closer the Cu–I–Bi angle to 180°, the narrower the band gap is. This is also supported by the DFT calculations, which show flat and direct band gaps governed by Cu, Bi and I atoms. Interestingly, the thin films formed by these compounds show preferential orientations to the ITO substrate with respect to the symmetries of the amines. The symmetry might indicate a deeper correlation of the compounds' polarities. Though this is still not fully understood, such a phenomenon is unknown to the field. The unambiguous semiconducting properties revealed in the representative compound 3, such as temperature-dependent conductivity, photo-current responses and high moisture/thermal stability shed light on the further application of these materials in optoelectronic devices.
