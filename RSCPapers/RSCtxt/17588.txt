    , Accepted 22nd June 2021First published on 23rd June 2021AbstractZinc sulfide, as an excellent catalyst, has attracted a lot of attention from scholars owing to its photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting in the ultraviolet (UV) region. In this work, polytype wurtzite-nH ZnS (n = 2 and 8) was synthesized successfully using thiourea (SCN2H4) as the sulfur source by hydrothermal and solvothermal methods. Compared with ZnS nanosheets and ZnS nanowires (2H), the ZnS hollow nanosphere (8H) photocatalysts exhibited the best light capturing ability, longest electric charge lifespan and highest electron (e−) and hole (h+) separation efficiency, which contributed to the superior photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate (10.35 mmol h−1 g−1) of ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) with good photostability was measured under the support of solar-light irradiation, and the highest apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 6.4% was recorded. This work not only presents the effects of the morphology and stacking order of crystal forms on the hydrogen production performance of photocatalysts, but also provides new insights into the construction of solar-light-driven catalysts for H2 production from H2O splitting.
1. Introduction
Photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution, as a H2O splitting reduction half-reaction, has attracted enormous attention from a lot of scholars owing to its clean, inexpensive and environmentally friendly nature.1–6 In the past few decades, many scientific researchers have made huge efforts to research excellent semiconductor photocatalysts for water splitting, which has been considered as a desirable approach for converting solar to chemical energy.7–12 However, due to some major limitations such as the insufficient light absorption, not enough active sites and the quick recombination of photogenerated charges, achieving high photocatalytic efficiency for H2 production is facing enormous difficulties.13–15 Therefore, developing an excellent photocatalyst, which can use visible light or UV for H2 evolution from water splitting effectively is extremely important.
As we all know, semiconductor photocatalysts must meet several criteria as follows: a suitable band structure, multiple reactive sites and good light absorption, in which way high performance towards photocatalytic water splitting could be achieved.16,17 To date, ZnS-based substances of sulfide semiconductor photocatalysts have been explored by many scientific researchers owing to their environment-friendly nature, high electrochemical stability and low cost to catalyze the H2O reduction reaction with high efficiency for H2 production, for example, Pt/ZnO-ZnS,18 Au/ZnS,19 ZnmIn2S3+m/In(OH)3,20,21 Ag2S/ZnS,22 AuNPs/Cd0.5Zn0.5S,23 ZnxCd1−xS,24,25etc. Because of photocorrosion, the instability of bare CdS is a fatal drawback during the photocatalytic reaction, where S2− can be oxidized by holes, resulting in the liberation of Cd2+ from the CdS photocatalyst.26–28 Last but not least, CdS is toxic and harmful to humans and the environment,29 and high costs of Au, Pt, In and Ag limit their applications in the field of photocatalysis.30–33 Taking into account the cost of synthetic raw materials and safety issues, we focus on single-component zinc sulfide with excellent conditions. Zinc sulfide is a competitive n-type substance with a unique electronic structure, inexpensiveness and environmentally friendly nature, which is used for the photocatalytic H2 evolution from water splitting, because it generates electron (e−) and hole (h+) pairs rapidly under UV light.34–36 Significantly, it has extremely high stability in the photocatalytic hydrogen production test, and this feature allows it to maintain a high hydrogen production efficiency during long cycles. What's more, zinc sulfide has two allotropes, the cubic zinc sphalerite structure and the hexagonal wurtzite structure, which are produced under low-temperature and high-temperature, respectively.37 ZnS can also be crystallized into many polytypes (2H, 4H, 6H, 8H, and 10H);37–42 we mainly researched 2H and 8H ZnS for photocatalytic H2 production from water splitting.
Herein, we successfully reported two facile hydrothermal and solvothermal strategies to synthesize wurtzite-8H and 2H ZnS photocatalysts via adding SCN2H4 as the sulfur source. The ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) as an extremely superior photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution exhibit the highest photostability under simulated sunlight irradiation (300 W xenon lamp, AM 1.5 G). Various kinds of characterization studies verify that ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) not only facilitate photogenerated electron (e−) and hole (h+) pair separation but also lengthen the lifespan of photogenerated charges hugely, resulting in outstanding photocatalytic performance. This work emphasizes the important effect of crystal forms and morphology on the one-component metal sulfide semiconductor catalysts and offers novel insights into the design and composite of outstanding photocatalysts.
2. Materials and method
All the chemicals (analytical reagent grade) in the below experiments were involved in the reactions and did not need additional purification.
2.1. Synthesis of the wurtzite-nH ZnS (n = 2 and 8) photocatalyst
Polytype wurtzite-nH ZnS (n = 2 and 8) was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal and solvothermal method and the growth process is described in Scheme 1. ZnS hollow nanospheres were synthesized by a frequently used one-pot hydrothermal method.43 Typically, 3 mmol CH4N2S and 1 mmol anhydrous zinc acetate were added in 60 mL deionized water (DI water) to obtain a clear solution with stirring for 30 minutes at room temperature. Then it was poured into a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 mL) and kept at 200 °C for one day. Last, the precipitates were cleaned several times with DI water and absolute ethanol to remove impurities one after another, respectively. The sample was further used after being dried in a vacuum.

ZnS nanosheets were prepared by an ethylenediamine assisted solvothermal method.44 The synthesis details of ZnS(en)0.5 are presented in the ESI.† Then 0.1 g ZnS(en)0.5 precursors were added into DI water (60 mL) and heated at 180 °C for 12 h with the hydrothermal method again. After the reaction, the ZnS nanosheets were rinsed several times with DI water, and dried at 80 °C overnight.
ZnS nanowires were synthesized using hydrazine hydrate by the substrate assisted solvothermal method reported by Chai et al.41 The synthesis method was the same as that of ZnS(en)0.5 except that ethylenediamine was replaced by hydrazine hydrate. CTAB was used to adjust the morphology of the three samples.
2.2. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was applied to measure the phase structure of the different samples on a Bruker D8 Advance super speed powder diffractometer. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were measured using a Zeiss_Supra55 system. High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were both obtained to analyze the different morphology of the three photocatalysts using a JEM-2100 electron microscope. A Horiba confocal LabRAM Aramis spectrometer was used to record Raman spectra with a 540 nm single-frequency excitation laser. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Escalab 250 system) was used to perform the surface chemical state analysis. The specific surface area of the photocatalysts was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method (Autosorb-IQ surface area analyzer). UV-vis spectra were acquired using a Cary 5000 spectrometer, and the reflectance standard was BaSO4 in all the tests. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured with an FLS 980 fluorescence spectrometer.
2.3. Photocatalytic activity tests
The H2 evolution experiments were performed at 15 °C in a Pyrex glass reactor (Labsolar-6A, Beijing Perfectlight), which was connected to a glass-closed gas circulation system with a rubber ring. In the photocatalytic experiment, the white power (20 mg) was dissolved in DI water (100 mL) by ultrasound containing 0.25 mol L−1 Na2SO3 and 0.35 mol L−1 Na2S as the hole (h+) consuming agents. The whole system was ventilated by a vacuum pump to remove a lot of air before the photocatalytic reaction, to ensure that the whole experiment occurred without the participation of oxygen (O2); after that, a 300 W Xe lamp (Beijing Perfectlight) with a cut-off filter of AM 1.5 was used as the light source for hydrogen production from water splitting. A magnetic stirrer was attached to the bottom of the reaction cell continuously, which was to maintain the small particles of the reaction solution in the suspension state all the time. The amount of H2 production was detected using an online gas chromatograph (GC-9790II, argon as the carrier gas, TCD as thermal conductivity detector). The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was also measured under the conditions similar to the photocatalytic reactions using AM 1.5 G, in detail, which was calculated by the following formula:  
2.4. Electrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, China), which was composed of a standard three-electrode cell and pre-allocated 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. In the measurement system, a platinum wire and a standard Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode respectively. We used high-purity N2 to remove O2 of the electrolyte solution for 20 minutes before all the tests. In detail, 10 mg sample was distributed in the 1 mL H2O–ethanol solution (VH2O:Vethanol =7:3); after ultrasonication for 60 minutes the average solution was acquired. The working electrode was made using a pipette through coating homogeneous photocatalyst solutions (20 μL) diametrically onto the cleaned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductor glass substrate with an effective area of about 1.0 cm2 (four sides surrounded by a label). After being dried naturally in a glass dish, it was heated at 100 °C for 3 h in an oven again. Lastly, the electrocatalytic activity of the catalysts was detected using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a potential ranging from −1.0 to 0.1 V with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 at room temperature and the transient photocurrent responses with time (i–t curve) of the working electrodes were detected at open circuit potential through several on–off illumination cycles. A 300 W xenon light (AM 1.5 G) was employed for the simulated solar-light excitation. The Mott–Schottky curve was obtained at three different frequencies of 1.0, 1.2 and 1.5 kHz for the three photocatalysts respectively. The tested potential range of the Mott–Schottky curve was the same as that of LSV. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at open circuit potential, in which the frequency was from 100 to 0.01 kHz during the test.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology analysis of the ZnS photocatalysts
The morphology of the re-prepared sample was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1a, we prepared hollow spherical ZnS (Zn:S =1:3) by a hydrothermal method successfully. The SEM images of ZnS with the different molar ratio of Zn:S =1:1, 1:2, 1:2.5, 1:3, and 1:4 (Fig. S1a–e, ESI†) reflect the growth process from the coexistence of the nanospheres and sheet-like morphology to the nanospheres, and consistent with the XRD pattern (Fig. S2, ESI†). In addition, TEM images show that ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) exhibit a diameter of average structure of approximately 180 nm in Fig. 1d. From the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1g), it can be seen that the lattice fringe spacing of ZnS hollow nanospheres was 0.309 nm, corresponding to the (008) lattice plane of the wurtzite-8H ZnS.37,42 Additionally, few defects can be seen in Fig. 1g, which suggests the near-perfect crystals of ZnS hollow nanospheres. As shown in Fig. 1j, the (008), (110) and (118) lattice planes were seen clearly in the diffraction pattern, corresponding well with the XRD patterns of ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) in Fig. 2a. We also tested the morphologies of ZnS nanosheets and ZnS nanowires (2H) through SEM and TEM technologies, which are flake and linear as shown in Fig. 1b, e and c, f, respectively. TEM and SEM images of ZnS(en)0.5 can be observed from Fig. S3a and b (ESI†), indicating that a smooth flake was obtained. The lattice fringe spacing of ZnS nanosheets and ZnS nanowires is determined to be 0.307 and 0.292 nm using the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 1h and i), which match well with the (100) and (101) facets of the wurtzite-2H ZnS. In addition, a lot of defects can be seen in the latter two samples from HRTEM images, which might not be conducive to facilitating the separation of generated carriers (e−–h+ pairs).45,46 The corresponding diffraction patterns shown in Fig. 1k–l reveal (101), (110) and (002) three lattice planes, which coincide exactly with the characteristic patterns of wurtzite-2H ZnS. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra of the three samples in Fig. 1m show the existence of Zn, S, C, and O elements. These results demonstrate the synthesis of the wurtzite zinc sulfide with different morphologies successfully.

3.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution XPS measurements of the ZnS photocatalysts
The crystalline structure of different photocatalysts with polytype wurtzite-8H and 2H ZnS was further investigated through X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. We can learn that the as-prepared samples show different diffraction peaks from Fig. 2a. The sharp peaks of the three photocatalysts indicate the good crystallinity in the structure, and every peak of ZnS hollow nanospheres is well matched with the wurtzite-8H ZnS (PDF #39-1363); however, all the peaks of ZnS nanosheets and ZnS nanowires can be well matched with the wurtzite-2H, syn ZnS (PDF #36-1450) in the card library. This appearance may be caused by different heating temperatures and times. In detail, it shows three characteristic peaks at 28.45°, 47.51° and 56.35° of ZnS hollow nanospheres belonging to (008), (110) and (118) crystalline planes, which correspond to 8H ZnS. For the other two substances, seven characteristic peaks located at 26.92°, 28.45°, 30.58°, 39.68°, 47.58°, 51.83°, and 56.48° correspond to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103) and (112) crystalline planes respectively, which coincide with 2H ZnS in the card library well.47 All the diffraction peaks for ZnS(en)0.5 in Fig. S4 (ESI†) match well with the pure structures of the ZnS(en)0.5. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the XRD patterns of ZnS with the molar ratio of Zn to S of 1:1, 1:2, 1:2.5, 1:3 (ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H)) and 1:4. In other words, no other peaks of the three samples can be seen in the XRD pattern, showing that the three photocatalysts are pure zinc sulfide. Notably, the characteristic peaks of ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) are stronger than those of the other two samples, which shows the relatively higher crystallinity and corresponds exactly to their better hydrogen production performance.
XPS spectra were measured in this work to confirm the surface chemical element valence of the as-prepared samples. The XPS survey spectrum of ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) is shown in Fig. 2b, which reveals that they were mainly composed of four chemical elements (Zn, S, C and O). The binding energy at 284.4 eV of C 1s was utilized as a reference to revise the binding energies. The two peaks in high-resolution XPS spectra of Zn 2p (Fig. 2c) for the sample located at 1043.92 and 1020.86 eV are assigned separately to Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2.48 The peaks in XPS spectra of S 2p (Fig. 2d) located at binding energies of 161.24 and 162.45 eV are attributed to S 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 of ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H),49 respectively. XPS survey spectra of the other two samples are shown in Fig. S5a and b (ESI†). Compared to the other two samples (Fig. S5c–f, ESI†), the binding energies of Zn 2p move approximately 0.06 eV toward the higher energy direction, and the binding energies of S 2p shift to the lower direction about 0.1 eV. Therefore, the analytical results of TEM, XRD and XPS verify that the ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) are synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method successfully.
3.3 Optical performances of the ZnS photocatalysts
To further investigate the existence of the stacking sequence or other defects in different zinc sulfide samples, PL spectra of the as-prepared solid phase photocatalysts were examined under the same test conditions and excited at 325 nm (Fig. 3a). ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) show a typically original diffraction peak at 385 nm; however, the typically intrinsic emission peaks of ZnS nanosheets and ZnS nanowires (2H) are at 375 nm and 350 nm,50 respectively. What's more, due to the surface states, they all indicate a shoulder peak at 460 nm.51 Compared with the other two photocatalysts, the strongest emission intensity of ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) was acquired, which indicates efficiently suppressed photogenerated carrier recombination when solar light is irradiated on the catalyst. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), FT-IR spectroscopy was performed to detect the main organic and inorganic peaks of the three substances.
 Fig. 3  (a) Fluorescence spectra (PL); (b) Raman spectra; (c) UV-vis DRS and (d) the (αhν)2versus hν curve of the three samples. 
The Raman spectra show the surface phase structure of the reprepared three samples as shown in Fig. 3b; a strong peak at 346.37 cm−1 is attributed to Raman spectra of different zinc sulfide samples, which belongs to longitudinal-optic A1(LO) and E1 (LO) phonon mode; however, a decentralized peak at 267.81 cm−1 originates from the transverse optical vibration mode (TO) of ZnS.52 The peak at 349.79 cm−1 of wurtzite-8H ZnS is the strongest compared with the spectrum of wurtzite-2H ZnS, which can be attributed to the good crystallinity. This phenomenon corresponds exactly to the XRD patterns in Fig. 2a. The intensity of Raman peaks in ZnS nanosheets and ZnS nanowires (2H) becomes broader than that of ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H), demonstrating a reduced polarizability. In contrast with wurtzite-8H ZnS, the negative moves of the two main peaks in wurtzite-2H ZnS were also observed, which is possibly due to the stronger interaction of the Zn–S bond caused. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of the three substances and the specific surface area of ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) is the smallest value (7.43 m2 g−1), but these do not result in the worst catalytic performance.
To prove the effect of the polytype on the optical/electronic properties of the as-synthesized photocatalysts, UV-vis DRS was performed (Fig. 3c). We can see that all the samples absorb solar light and a small amount of visible light clearly, indicating that all of them use solar-light to trigger photocatalytic water splitting reaction, which maybe originate from the different stacking sequence in the polytype of their structures. A red-shift is obtained in the absorption fringes as the topography changes obviously, indicating that ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) exhibit the highest absorption intensity in the three samples due to the larger hollow structure. From the Kubelka–Munk formula (αhv = A(hv − Eg)1/2, the corresponding main band structures of the different ZnS samples in the UV light region are shown in Fig. 3d. The formula is composed of the absorption coefficient (α), the photon energy (hv), the direct band gap (Eg), and a constant (A).53 The three band gaps are 3.25, 3.43 and 3.7 eV for ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H), ZnS nanosheets and ZnS nanowires (2H), respectively, and the band gap of the first sample is the smallest of the three photocatalysts, which can be seen obviously in Fig. 3d.
3.4 Photocatalytic H2 evolution performances of the ZnS photocatalysts
The photocatalytic H2 evolution stability was assessed without noble metal co-catalysts adding Na2S (0.35 mol L−1) and Na2SO3 (0.25 mol L−1) aqueous solutions as hole trapping agents under solar light irradiation (AM 1.5G) (Fig. 4a). Evidently, we can see that the ZnS nanowires (2H) exhibit extremely poor photocatalytic activity because the electrons are consumed by holes rapidly. Surprisingly, the amounts of hydrogen generation of ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) increase linearly with prolonged illumination time. Different proportions of ZnS can also be seen in Fig. S8 (ESI†); among them, ZnS hollow nanospheres (Zn:S =1:3) have the best effect on hydrogen production. The ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) display excellent photocatalytic activity (19.75 mmol g−1) under 5 h of irradiation with solar-light, comparable to multiple studies about ZnS-based photocatalysts (Table S1, ESI†). The rate of H2 evolution for the three photocatalysts under solar-light irradiation was depicted (Fig. 4b). It can be seen that the corresponding hydrogen evolution rates are 0.95, 1.40, and 10.35 mmol h−1 g−1 for ZnS nanowires, ZnS nanosheets (2H) and ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H); especially, that of the former is 7.4 and 10.8 times that of the other two samples, respectively. The AQE values are 6.4%, 0.09%, and 0.06% for ZnS hollow nanosphere (8H), ZnS nanosheet and ZnS nanowire (2H) photocatalysts, respectively. Therefore, ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) with the smallest specific surface area show the best photocatalytic activity, which may be caused by their special stacking sequence in the polytype in the structure.

(c) Recyclability testing and comparison of H2 evolution over ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) and ZnS nanosheets (2H). (d) Comparison of XRD patterns before and after the photocatalytic hydrogen production experiment of ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H). 
In addition, we further investigated the recyclability of H2 evolution of the three photocatalysts over four runs, and the results are shown in Fig. 4c. The hydrogen rate of ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) is almost identical after four cycles, which shows its superior stability and anti-photocorrosion capability. It was observed from the picture that the maximum amount of photocatalytic H2 evolution of ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) is 1.82 mmol g−1 in the four runs, whereas ZnS nanosheets (2H) have little H2 evolution activity which only reaches 0.23 mmol g−1. The fresh and used ZnS hollow nanospheres (Fig. 4d) and ZnS nanosheets (Fig. S9, ESI†) have no notable differences; the only change is that the absorption peak changed after photocatalytic reaction, which implies that they have photostability to some degree. From the color point of view, the used catalysts become darker than the fresh catalyst. These results tell us that ZnS hollow nanosphere photocatalysts with superior stability have great potential to be adopted in solar-light-driven hydrogen evolution.
3.5 Electrochemical performances of the ZnS photocatalysts
To certify the considerable function of the polytype in boosting the diffusion of photogenerated carriers, we also used EIS Nyquist plots to confirm photogenerated electron–hole pair transfer behavior of the re-prepared photocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 5a, in contrast, the ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) exhibit the smallest impedance semicircle of the three samples, which certifies the lowest recombination velocity and the best separation efficiency of charge carriers, and shows efficient photolysis of water to produce H2 under solar light irradiation. Additionally, the electrochemical hydrogen generation activities of the catalysts are studied by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) technique, too. The cathodic current interrelated with the reduction half reaction of H2O on the working electrode in Na2SO4 electrolytic solution. Because of the quick charge metastasis at the photocatalyst interface, the ZnS hollow nanospheres display lower over-potential compared with the other two samples (Fig. 5b). Whilst it requires an over-potential of −0.82 V for 1 mA cm−2, ZnS nanosheets and ZnS nanowires (2H) require a larger over-potential of −0.93 V and −0.98 V to drive 1 mA cm−2. This further indicates its superior separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs when the photocatalysts are used for photolysis of water to produce hydrogen.

In addition, the flat band potentials of the three samples are acquired from the analysis of the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots. The positive slopes of plots at frequencies of 1.2, 1.5, and 2.0 KHZ indicate that wurtzite-2H ZnS and 8H ZnS photocatalysts are both n-type semiconductors,54 which are calculated to be −0.60, −0.82 and −0.86 V vs. Ag/AgCl (equivalent to −0.40, −0.62 and −0.66 V vs. NHE) in Fig. 5c–e, respectively. Generally, the conduction band (CB) potentials of these kinds of semiconductors can be about −0.2 V negative compared to their flat band potentials.22 Therefore, the CB value can be calculated to be −0.60, −0.82 and −0.86 V vs. NHE for ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H), ZnS nanosheets and ZnS nanowires (2H), respectively. Based on the band gap value (Eg) derived from UV-DRS conversion, the valence band (VB) potentials of the three samples are +2.75, +2.71 and +2.94 V vs. NHE, separately, obtained by the equation EVB = ECB + Eg (Eg is the direct band gap).
The transient photocurrent response measurement was performed to analyze the photogenerated electron–hole pair segregation efficiencies of ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) and ZnS nanosheets (8H) during ten continuous on–off cycles under the same irradiation condition. The photocurrent intensity (Fig. 5f) of the two photocatalysts is in accordance with the photocatalytic-H2 production activities in Fig. 4a. The lower photocurrent intensity of ZnS nanowires (2H) can be seen in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) show the highest photocurrent intensity under simulated solar light irradiation (AM 1.5G), reflecting the best separation and migration efficiencies of photogenerated e−–h+ pairs. This result tells us that the excellent photocatalytic activity of hollow spherical ZnS can be ascribed to polytype 8H in the structure, improving the solar light response greatly.
3.6 Possible photocatalytic mechanism
Therefore, it is safe to assume the formation of polytype structures such as wurtzite 2H and 8H from the XRD pattern and HRTEM images. Scheme 2a displays the schematic illustration of band structures of the three photocatalysts. Scheme 2b shows the possible mechanism for photocatalytic–H2 evolution over ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) under the support of simulated solar light (AM 1.5G). The much higher photocatalytic–H2 production activity of the sample is due to two reasons as follows: firstly, the formed crystal forms of the photocatalysts are different, ZnS hollow nanospheres are wurtzite-8H and the other two are wurtzite-2H, although the energy of 2H is the lowest among the polytypes, the light absorption is extremely poor. Secondly, a lot of defects can be seen in the latter two samples, while few ones are observed in ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H), which proves that the defects are not conducive to capturing light to improve the separation of electron–hole pairs. When light is irradiated on the catalyst, the possible mechanism is that the photogenerated electrons transfer from the VB to the CB of ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H), which can reduce the H+/H2O to generate H2 effectively. Then the S2− and SO32− will be oxidized to SO42− and S2O32− by the lots of photogenerated holes accumulated in the VB of the sample. Therefore, we can draw a conclusion that wurtzite-8H ZnS has a great potential to modify photocatalysts for simulated solar-light catalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting.

4. Conclusions
In summary, hexagonal wurtzite-nH ZnS (n = 2 and 8) was successfully fabricated by the hydrothermal and solvothermal method, with thiourea as the sulfur source. The ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) exhibited the best solar-light absorption and rapid transport and separation of photogenerated carriers compared with the other two samples. Although ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) have the smallest specific surface area, the H2 evolution rate (10.35 mmol h−1 g−1) of the photocatalyst without any co-catalyst is the highest value, which is 10.8, 7.5 times higher than that of ZnS nanowires and ZnS nanosheets (2H) under solar-light irradiation with 0.35 mol L−1 Na2S and 0.25 mol L−1 Na2SO3 as the hole consuming agents. The AQE of ZnS hollow nanospheres (8H) reaches 6.4% at 15 °C. Consequently, besides the difference in heating temperature and time, there is a distinct stacking order in polytype structure, which may be the reason for the hydrogen production efficiency of the 8H ZnS much higher than that of the 2H ZnS. The work throws new light on the construction of solar-light-driven photocatalysts for H2 production from water splitting to improve solar energy capture and conversion.
