    , Accepted 3rd May 2023First published on 5th May 2023AbstractThe catalytic transformation of CO2 into valuable fuels/chemicals is a promising and economically profitable process because it offers an alternative toward fossil feedstocks and the benefit of transforming and cycling the CO2 on a scale-up. Cost-effective and high efficiency catalysts are of extremely significance to cut down the utilizing costs of CO2. Numerous studies have been carried out to develop the catalyst design for the conversion processes. Traditional metal nanoparticle-based catalysts still need to promote the active metal utilization efficiency, catalytic activity, and selectivity. Inspirationally, single-atom catalysis (SACs) has aroused significant interest of researchers owing to their maximum atom utilization, unique electronic structure, and strong metal–support interaction, offering promising strategies to facilitate the catalytic efficiency and long-term stability. The well-designed and specific structure of SACs also affords the merits to essential studies for revealing the underlying mechanism and active sites during the CO2 utilization. In this review, we summarize and emphasize the recent progress in the development of advanced SACs for electrocatalytic, photocatalytic, and thermocatalytic conversion of CO2 into versatile products (CO, CH4, CH3OH, HCOOH, and C2+ products). In addition, the general principles of SAC design and the structure–performance relationship that were also systematically and constructively investigated serve as a way to explore the key parameters in deciding the catalytic performance. Moreover, we display the catalytic efficiency of different SACs for CO2 conversion published recently to offer an in-depth assessment of these catalysts. Finally, the main challenges and perspectives in the future applications of SACs toward CO2 conversion are also considered.

Broader context
Single-atom catalysis (SACs) provides an excellent platform to understand the active centers, explore the underlying catalytic mechanism, and reveal the structure–performance relationships, and have thus drawn ever-increasing attention for CO2 conversion and utilization. Massive study efforts have been devoted to introduce SACs and their advances have been widely reviewed. However, compared with traditional metal nanoparticle-based catalysts, SACs are still in their infancy in the field of electrochemical reduction, photocatalytic reduction, and thermochemical conversion of CO2, but they have aroused substantial concern in recent years, thus illuminating their prospect in practical applications. Hence, a timely and comprehensive introduction to advanced SACs and its recent advances in converting CO2 toward various valuable hydrocarbons (CO, CH4, CH3OH, HCOOH, and C2+ products) are of great significance for the development of SACs. Herein, detailed introductions and summaries were classified into three categories based on the CO2 transformation technologies, and their corresponding versatile products have also been systematically summarized and discussed. In addition, the design principles, practical applications, as well as perspective insights of SACs in CO2 conversion are also emphasized. We believe that this review will provide some new insights into the fields of carbon resource storage and conversion.

1. Introduction
CO2 has recently attracted considerable attention owing to its massive emissions and negative effect on global climate change at an accelerating pace and is threatening the living environment of our planet. CO2 emissions have increased from approximately 16 Gt in 1970 to 36.3 Gt in 2021 based on the IEA Energy Data Centre with predominant emissions from fossil fuels.1 As shown in Fig. 1, if there is no effective solution to overcome the problem, the continuously growing annual emissions of CO2 will bring about a climb in synchronization for the global-mean air surface both on the planet and the sea-level from 1990 to 2100.2 It is also suggested that CO2 emissions should be decreased to net-zero by about 2050 to restrain the global temperature rise under 1.5 °C by 2100.3,4 In this context, CO2 fixation has attracted broad interest, and myriad of efforts have been devoted to develop various technologies for CO2 capture, carbon capture, and storage/utilization (CCS/CCU), which are significant pathways for regulating CO2 emissions from human activities.5–9 CCU aims at obtaining exhaust or atmospheric CO2 and employing them as a feedstock during industrial production to prepare more economically value-added products. CO2 transformation can be further divided into diversified fuels/chemicals, microalgae fuels, and concrete building materials, and its extensive applications in promoted oil recovery are some of the conventional routes of CCU. These can lower the emissions of CO2 from industries, substitute for fossil fuels, and favor a decrease in atmospheric CO2. CO2 conversion for the industrial applications of fuels makes up a ‘cycling’ route; hence, carbon is transformed cyclically via various industrial processes. CO2 used to synthesize fuels by renewable energy sources can further facilitate the supply of the renewable energy in an easier approach of liquid fuels, which can be conveniently stored and transported. The transformation of CO2 toward various chemicals would offer an interest in CO2 storage in about several decades. Nevertheless, the capacity of CO2 that can be cycled via chemicals is fairly low with respect to the envisioned future compared with what can be cycled by fuels.10

Instead of a valueless resource, CO2 proves to be a highly potential C1 building blocks to synthesize a variety of value-added fuels and chemicals.11–16 Compared to the CCS of CO2, the conversion of CO2 are more attractive over a long period of time.6,17–19 The utilization of CO2 can offer a substitutable method to transform the renewable feedstocks toward beneficial fuels/chemicals and concurrently achieve the high efficiency circulation of global CO2 resources.13,19–22 Direct pathways for CO2 conversion to desirable products are concerned with the conversion reaction of CO2 with H2 to generate CO, CH4, CH3OH, olefins, dimethyl ether (DME), etc., with the valuable commodities relying on the catalyst, reaction device, and manipulating the pressure and temperature. In addition, conversion of CO2 to a variety of value-added products, which was carried out via electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, or thermocatalysis, affords a practically carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative approach during the period of energy use. Consequently, it is regarded as a potentially significant approach for lowering the emissions of CO2 and forming valuable products at the same time.23–29 Nowadays, the thermocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CO, CH3OH, DME, etc., provides the advantage of more favorable kinetics and has received significant attention.4,30,31 The merit of applying the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O (OER) under the influence of an outer electric field to offer electrons is also in prospect an attractive approach, which integrates the two processes of generating H2 from H2O and CO2 transformation in a single process that can be carried out to generate high valuable and high-energy density commodities such as CH3CH2OH and HCOOH.32–35 The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 using semiconductor materials is driven via solar energy to promote the process of light absorption, charge separation and migration, and further surface reactions. It is also able to facilitate CO2 to CO, CH4, CH3OH, and other commodities, which can be handled under mild conditions without additional energy consumption.36–38
The catalysts applied in the conversion of CO2 serves as a central role in determining the comprehensive environmental and economic influence of reaction processes.39,40 Even though a variety of reports have witnessed a boom in research focused on candidate technologies, nevertheless, most of the promising technologies (electricity, photons, and heat) are still immature and need further marked advancement prior to implementation on the scale of industrialization. Similar to the majority of chemical transformation strategies, several catalysts have been fabricated and have exhibited superior catalytic properties for CO2 utilization.41–43 The most crucial issues call for innovations in catalytic systems through cost-efficient, high-activity, controlled selectivity, and long-term stability catalysts.44–46 As a result, improving and adjusting catalytic materials have become the core in the study for CO2 utilization technologies, with significant progress having been obtained at present.47 Yet, considerable challenges still remain.
As a most promising catalytic material, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have recently emerged with isolated metal atoms anchored by solid supports could cut down the cost of catalysts by maximizing metal dispersion and efficiency of atom-utilization and have obtained important research interest in the past decade.48–57 Compared with nanoparticle catalysts (include bulk metals), SACs are considered as the most economical catalyst due to a 100% atom utilization efficiency.50,58–62 This is an unique characteristic and significant from the point of view of the industrial application owing to the maximized uniform dispersion of metal for SACs could considerably decrease the amount of noble metals.63–66 The maximum metal utilization efficiency over SACs give rise to even outstanding catalytic activity per surface atom than those over nanoparticles (NPs).67–70 In addition, the strong interactions for the metal site and the carrier can realize the fine-tuning of inherent electronic configurations of the metal center by regulating coordination environments.71–73 Simultaneously, the isolated metal site could greatly influence the characteristics of their neighboring atoms.74 SACs have been considered as a bridge between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis owing to the atomically dispersed, adjustable active centers together with unique electronic, and spatial interaction with various ligands.75–78 The advantages of SACs have demonstrated an enormous potential to comprehend the connection between the catalytic structure and performance, including the explanation of catalytic mechanisms at the atomic level.78–81 Therefore, SACs have attracted extensive attention in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, which deals with CO2 utilization to generate renewable value-added products.72,73,82
In view of the recent breakthroughs published on SACs in selective conversion of CO2,4,32,83–87 we focus on the unique properties of SACs structures and their underlying applications and merits in the transformation of CO2 into diversified renewable commodities by electrocatalytic, photocatalytic, and thermocatalytic process, and the underlying structure–activity relationships are deeply discussed. We also highlight the general principles, synthesis strategy, and dynamic volution of active sites during the reaction process with an investigation to reveal the key factors in determining the catalyst performance from an economic and a technological perspective. A brief overview of this paper is displayed in Fig. 2, demonstrating these catalytic feature of SACs. On account of these characteristics, the activity of SACs for electro-, photo-, and thermocatalytic reactions has been exhibited to surpass that of traditional catalysts based on NPs.
 Fig. 2  Overview of the topics covered in this review. 
We hope this comprehensive introduction will be an in-depth understanding for viewers to investigate more efficient heterogeneous catalysts with the aim of decreasing the spending of renewable commodities so that these fuel and chemical productions can be viable alternatives to fossil energy and fossil feedstock-derived chemicals. Finally, we outline the remaining challenges and opportunities in this field.
2. Understandings of SACs
2.1 Types and synthetic strategies of SACs
Seeking suitable supports to anchor the isolated metal metals could prolong the lifetimes of the catalysts and enhance the economic benefits of industrialization. Supported SACs and single-atom alloy (SAA) are two main types of SACs. Usually, metal oxides (TiO2, CeO2, FeOx, ZrO2, CuO, Al2O3),88–91 zeolite,48,92–94 2D material,95–97etc.,55,98–100 are widely used as supports for fabricating SACs.
Metal oxides have been diffusely investigated for anchoring isolated metal single atoms and have fascinated wide concern due to their specific and diverse properties such as the face acidity, alkalinity, and redox characters, which give rise to special reaction performance. In addition, the affluent –OH groups and defect sites (corners, vacancies, steps) over the “host oxide” appearance can act as the stabilizing sites for SACs. The interactions with oxide carrier enormously affect the reaction features because of their synergistic effects. The thermodynamic stability of SACs demands an appropriate support with the affluence of anchoring sites and strong interaction between metal species on the surface.103–105 Thus, reducible supports of CeO2, CoOx, FeOx, etc., are widely investigated for anchoring isolated metal atoms. Different kinds of Al2O3, MgO, and SiO2 have also been used as non-reducible supports for thermally stable isolated single atoms by rational design. In this review, some universally reported metal oxide supports in SACs are emphasized. CeO2 is an important substrate for anchoring metal single atoms in heterogeneous catalysis and has been extensively explored. One of the most fascinating characteristics of CeO2 is its abundant vacancy content, which can be used to anchor SACs. For instance, Au1 atoms probably has vacancy sites of the surface Ce, which lead to a higher loading of metal SACs compared with the FeOx carrier.112 Besides, the power to alterably lay in oxygen and the tendency to anchor transition metals with a high dispersion level make CeO2 an active carrier during several C1-chemical involved reactions, such as DRM, WGS, CH4 oxidation, and CO2 conversion. As shown in Fig. 3a–e, isolated ionic Pd species obtained by impregnation on the surface of CeO2 nanorods are prone to reduction and agglomeration into metallic clusters during CO oxidation, while Pd single atoms on FSP-derived catalysts exhibit a high resistance against sintering. The lattice oxygen of CeO2 can be activated by Pd-doping, thus enhancing the stability and reactivity of Pd SACs at the Pd–O–Ce interface.84 The excellent stability and plentiful oxygen vacancies were also revealed due to the existence of Ce3+.106–108 The synergy effect of Ni and Ru single atoms for DRM reaction (Fig. 3f–i) was confirmed by the lowest apparent activation barrier and DFT calculation. Compared with the Ni1 or Ru1 catalyst, two sets of single-atom site catalysts displayed the highest TOF and good coke resistance.101 Compared with Pt NPs/CeO2 catalyst, atomically-dispersed Pt1/CeO2 could be acquired via the same activity and selectivity. The coordination environment and electrostatic repulsion of single atom-induced Pt sites were responsible for the catalytic behavior (Fig. 3j–m).102 The loading of Pt SACs supported on CeO2via the atom trapping method can reach 3 wt%109,110 and decrease to 0.1 wt% by the conventional electrostatic adsorption method.111 In addition, Au,112 Rh,113 Ir,114 and Cu115 supported on CeO2 were also synthesized. FeOx was also widely discussed to anchor Pt single atoms.90,116 Fe is one of the most rich metals and could readily coordinate with oxygen. Because of the redox features of Fe, different crystalline structures of FeOx are generated under various catalytic environments and pretreatment means. Previous researches on atomically-dispersed Pt atoms were stabilized on the three-fold hollow sites over an O3-terminated surface by substituting one of the original Fe atoms revealed by DFT and EXAFS.112 Pt atoms accurately captured the iron locations and boosted the generation of Ov on Fe2O3, which profoundly developed the reducibility of the carrier. Pt atoms donated electrons to the carrier, taking several positive charges (+0.45|e|), causing superior catalytic performance for CO oxidation and the first CO oxidation in an H2-rich atmosphere. Single-atom Pd,117 Ni,118 Ir,119 and Au112,120 supported on FeOx were also fabricated with analogous processes. The preparation of metal oxide SACs by a conventional method for stabilizing the single atoms on surface vacancies or step/edge sites offer stronger metal–support bindings.74,88,108,121,122

Due to molecular size and shape selectivity, acidic centers, and high specific surface areas, zeolite have been extensively employed as excellent candidates for anchoring SACs. The typical strategy of H, Na, and K ion-exchange process was used for the modulation of the zeolite microenvironment.123–125 The advantage of spatial confinement is an efficient approach for improving the synthesis of zeolite-supported SACs. A variety of organometallic complexes are encapsulated into the zeolite cavity that can be transformed into single atoms or subnanoclusters with superior catalytic performance in catalytic reactions, inhibiting the migration and aggregation of mononuclear metal centers.92,126 The strong bonding between metal cations with the –O ligands on the surface of zeolite can enable the single atoms to be strongly anchored. Similar strategies were also widely employed for the preparation of covalent organic framework (COF)127–129 and metal–organic framework (MOF)130–132-supported isolated single-atoms.
Because of the high electrical and thermal properties and diversified structures, carbon-based materials with heteroatom dopants and abundant defects have been extensively utilized to synthesize SACs.133–136 A variety of atomically dispersed transition metals (Fe, Co, and Ni) supported on the N-doped graphene (M1–N–C) with high binding energies has been successfully discussed.137–139 The structure of M1–N–C has becoming a promising catalyst for CO2 conversion due to the relatively high hydrothermal stability.140–142 Furthermore, the supports of metal carbides (TiC,143 MoC,100 WxC,144etc.) and metal sulfides (MoS2145 and FeS146) also exhibited superior properties for the preparation of SACs.
One particular classification of the SACs is the so-called single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, which are made up of bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed on a solid support comprised of one dominant majority elements mixed with a small amount of minority element, highly diluted and presumably atomically dispersed.147–151 Combining the advantages of single atom and metal alloys, SAAs have rapidly become a new research frontier in the field of materials and catalysis. SAAs were firstly illustrated to facilitate hydrogen dissociation, spillover, and hydrogenation process on Pd1/Cu(111) by Sykes's group.152 Stephanopoulos's group reported that Pt1–Cu SAAs markedly weakened the adsorption of CO on Pt single atom compared with the Pt NPs and CO tolerance, which was further enhanced during the H2 activation process.153 The maximized atom efficiency, adsorption properties, and remarkable synergetic effects from electronic and geometric characteristics consequently facilitated the high activity and selectivity obtained by SAAs.147,154–156
To achieve the stabilization of single metal atoms on the support surface, promising synthetic methods still face numerous issues to deal with migration and aggregation during the synthesis and reaction processes. To date, remarkably different high-efficiency synthetic strategies of SACs have been applied by scientific researchers, such as impregnation and coprecipitation, defect engineering, atomic layer deposition, transforming metal NPs into SA, spatial confinement(MOF, COF, zeolite, and carbon-based materials), and chemical etching.157–160 The synthetic methods and key parameters for SACs are also summarized in Fig. 4, and detailed discussion has been reported by our group recently.49–51,161

2.2 Size dependence of heterogeneous metal catalysts
The catalytic reactivity of heterogeneous catalysts is highly limited by the nanoparticle size. The activity can be markedly promoted with the decrease in the size of the active components, particularly when the particle sizes is smaller than 2–3 nm.162,163 In addition, the electronic and geometric structures of smaller nanoparticles are strongly impacted by metal–support interactions compared with larger particles.164,165 The size dependence of catalytic properties can be comprehended in view of adsorbate adsorption.166 The reason is mainly because the preferred pathways and reaction barriers are connected with the binding energies of reactants, intermediates, and products.167 Recent works show that this size dependence is particularly important in the subnanometer regime, which could obviously change the catalytic performance compared to their larger particle counterparts. For instance, Vajda and coworkers168 reported Pt8–10 clusters-supported Al2O3 are 40–100 times more active than the larger-sized Pt or V/Al2O3 catalysts in the ODH of propane into propylene. Karim et al.169 showed that subnanometer-sized Pt supported on TiO2 illustrate significant ethylene selectivity than large Pt nanoparticles for the hydrogenation of acetylene.
SACs are considered as the most economical catalyst with high mass activity and nearly 100% atom utilization; thus, reducing the active element to single atom is favorable for obtaining superior performance in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.50,51,170 The lowest limit of particle sizes thus provides new opportunities for designing SACs. It was reported171 that a series of size-controllable Cu components range from single atom to subnanometer clusters supported on graphdiyne matrix (Cu/GDY) (Fig. 5a–c) were fabricated by a facile acetylenic-bond-directed site-trapping approach. They found that the activity and selectivity in CO2/CORR were greatly dependent on the size of the Cu particles. Recently, Jiang et al. synthesized single-atom, dimer, and cluster catalysts via atomic layer deposition (ALD). The type and content of in-plane epoxy groups on the graphene surface could be regulated by modulating the number of O3 pre-etching cycles, thus enhancing the deposition of Pt species. The intrinsic activity of AB hydrolysis is highly dependent on the Pt sizes.172 As shown in Fig. 5e–g, a series of Pt species with variable sizes, from isolated single atoms and clusters, supported on the N-doped graphene, were synthesized by a general ALD method,173 which could precise control the Pt sizes, modulate the coordination environment, and create a different electronic structure of Pt. Importantly, compared with Pt subcluster and particles, the mass activity of the HER for Pt single atoms catalyst was 37.4 times higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (Fig. 5h). Besides, the single-atom coordination structure of the active region of the metal–support is uncertain to obtain the optimum catalytic properties in every aspect. Huang et al.174 reported that graphdiyne (GDY)-supported Mo3 cluster exhibits outstanding NRR properties than Mo SAC. The thermodynamics of the determining steps could be balanced via the mild and optimal N2 adsorption energy of the Mo3 clusters.

3. CO2 conversion with SACs
This part gives the recent progress of employing SACs for CO2 transformation to value-added products via electro-, photo- or thermocatalytic technologies.
3.1 Outline of catalytic CO2 conversion
CO2 is a linear molecule constituted by an atom of carbon which gives up all its four electrons to covalently double bond to two atoms of oxygen (OCO). Thermodynamically, the oxygen bonds with carbon are quite strong, making CO2 considerably stable. In addition, the Gibbs free energy of CO2 (ΔG° = −394 kJ mol−1) is much lower than that of the products (CO, −137.2 kJ mol−1; CH4, −51 kJ mol−1; CH3OH, −166.4 kJ mol−1; HCOOH, −361.4 kJ mol−1; HCHO, −109.9 kJ mol−1; (NH2)2CO, −197.5 kJ mol−1; HCN, 124.7 kJ mol−1) from CO2 conversion.175 Therefore, CO2 conversion typically requires external energy input such as electro-, photo-, or thermochemical technologies that are needed for substantial energy input and active catalyst to weaken the CO2 stability and fundamentally resolve the thermodynamic barriers.4,10,176,177 The energy input of electricity, photon, and heat in CO2 transformation needs different units and running temperature, which lead to tremendous difference about the mechanisms. Apparently, the reaction paths, conditions, and mechanisms for electro-, photo-, and thermochemical are completely different.4,178–181 Although there are only limited industrial applications using CO2 at present, a variety of promising reactions for CO2 conversion have been reported.12,182–184 Consequently, the current progress of CO2 transformation technologies are classified and discussed in this section.

3.1.1 Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. 
Electrochemical CO2 reduction is considered as CO2 transformation to renewable fuel and chemicals in an electrolytic cell utilizing electrical energy input, which has greatly attracted research concerns for energy storage and conversion.185–190 The electrolytic cell is made of the cathode or negative electrode, electrolyte, and anode or positive electrode. During electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (Fig. 6), the oxidation of H2O at the anode generates O2 and electrons/protons (e−/H+); simultaneously, CO2 is reduced into CO, CH4, HCOOH, CH3OH, CH3CH2OH, HCHO, and C2H4 at the cathode (Table 1).191 However, CO2 electrolysis or CO2/H2O co-electrolysis can also be favorable for the generation of CO/syngas and oxygen ions (O2−) at the cathode in solid oxide electrolysis cells. O2− ions are transmitted to the anode via the electrolyte, where they combine and further generate O2.192 The advantages of CO2 electrocatalytic process are as follows: (a) can receive CH4 and C2+ product under a low pressure; (b) reaction processes are relatively mild; (c) compact and modular systems are easier to expand the scale-up.10

3.1.2 Photocatalytic CO2 reduction. 
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction using water instead of hydrogen is believed as an underlying approach for renewable solar energy into high-energy chemicals (Table 1). Fig. 7 involved five major steps: (a) absorption of photons/light to generate electrons (e−) and holes (h+); (b) separation of the generated holes and electrons; (c) CO2 adsorption on the catalyst surface; (d) CO2 and e− photochemical reduction and H2O oxidation; (e) desorption of products.193 The main products of CO2 photoreduction are CO, CH4, and CH3OH. The conventional photocatalysts are metal oxides (TiO2, Nb2O5, ZnO, ZrO2, Fe2O3, perovskites, etc.), metal sulfides (CdS, ZnS, etc.), carbon materials (g-C3N4, graphene, MOFs), layered double hydroxides (LDH), SiC, and transition metal complexes.194–196 Many advantages for the photocatalytic systems have been reported by researchers, but the efficiency is low, product selectivity is difficult to handle, and the reaction mechanism also needs to be further explored.197–199

3.1.3 Thermocatalytic CO2 conversion. 
CO2 reforming of methane (DRM) and CO2 hydrogenation are the main transformation reactions for thermocatalytic CO2 conversion.200 As seen in Table 1, it offers an attractive route to simultaneously convert both the major greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4 to syngas (CO/H2), which can be used for the synthesis of high-energy products by Fischer–Tropsch synthesis process. Fig. 8 depicts the three types of CH4 reforming processes of dry reforming (DRM), bi-reforming (BRM), and Oxy-CO2 reforming (ORM); the detailed reactions are listed in Table 1, and the detailed reaction equation and enthalpy of formation at 298 K(ΔH298K) have been summarized.3,4,10 DRM is a highly endothermic reaction, illustrating the high stability of CO2 and CH4 and usually requires high reaction temperatures (600–1000 °C), which easily lead to catalyst rapid deactivation because of coke and carbon deposition.10,193,201,202 Thus, part of the active metal surface was covered, making it unavailable for the reaction.203,204
 Fig. 8  Various types of DRM processes.205 Copyright 2021, Elsevier Ltd. 
CO2 hydrogenation is regarded as the addition of renewable H2 to CO2, providing an extremely desirable route for converting CO2 to valuable compounds.184,206–209 As H2 has a higher Gibbs free energy than CO2, the activation of CO2via hydrogenation is thermodynamically favorable, which can be catalyzed by various metal oxides (ZrO2, SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, CeO2, etc.) supported Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, or noble-metal Ru, Rh, Pt, Pd catalysts under a relatively gentler reaction temperature between 250 and 400 °C.3,210 Depending on the reaction conditions and catalyst, a myriad of hydrocarbons and oxygenates may be produced. Limited by the stability of CO2 and high kinetic barriers for C–C coupling, it is quite difficult to synthesize C2+ hydrocarbons than CH4 or oxygenates (e.g., CH3OH, HCOOH, and CH3OCH3). In addition, CO2 hydrogenation can be generally divided into direct and indirect routes. The C1 products such as CO, CH4, CH3OH, and HCOOH mostly synthesized via direct route,206,211 C2+ hydrocarbons, and oxygenates (e.g., CH3OCH3, olefins, liquid fuels, and higher alcohols) are primarily performed via modified CO2-Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) or the CO2–methanol-mediated process.206,212,213 During the process of modified CO2-FTS, CO2 was firstly reduced to CO or syngas by the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, followed by CO hydrogenation into C2+ products via C–C coupling.214,215 The methanol-mediated process integrates CO2 reduction to CH3OH and CH3OH dehydration or coupling into C2+ products. Furthermore, as structural and/or electronic promoter, K, Na, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Ce were usually employed to elevate both the activity and product distribution.6,14,216–218 Although CO2 hydrogenation to C2+ products is operationally favorable, a low selectivity to the target products and wide product distribution is inevitable.210,219
Thus, overall, compared with electrocatalytic and photocatalytic reduction, thermocatalysis is evidently attractive in view of its potential industrial favorability as well as higher efficiency and yield. However, the development of these technologies is still on the road, and it is also unpredictable as to which technology will dominate the energy market in the future. Therefore, it is urgently needed to explore the promising catalysts for CO2 transformation. Because of the excellent catalytic properties of maximizing atom-utilization efficiency, tunable coordination environment, and extremely uniform active centers, SACs demonstrate a great potential to serve as ideal platforms for precisely tuning the relationship between the structure and catalytic properties as well as understanding the catalytic mechanisms at the atomic level. To achieve this target, this paper reviews the recent progress of CO2 conversion via electro-, photo-, and thermocatalytic processes catalyzed by SACs. The advantages and major challenges in the various pathways of catalytic CO2 transformation are summarized in Fig. 9.

3.2 SACs for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction
In simplified terms, CO2RR is a challenging reaction because high overpotentials was required in the first step for CO2 to CO2− because the competitive and often kinetically favored H2O reduction to H2 must be prohibited.220–223 CO is the most easily produced C1 targets in all products due to its high selectivity and current density during CO2RR compared with other pathways. Due to the low overpotentials, noble metals such as Pd, Au, Ag, Ru, Ir, Rh, and Pt catalysts have been widely investigated.224–227 Regrettably, the high costs infinitely obstructed their further application in CO2RR. Thus, making the most of metals and illustrating the influences of particle size are crucially important. A myriad of strategies such as bimetallic alloying and metal–carbide modification for boosting the catalytic properties of the metal has been reported,228–230 but high metal loadings are usually needed. Consequently, the works for efficient SACs to CO2RR have swiftly increased recently, but the comprehensive research for CO2RR based on SACs did not appear until the carbon-based SACs with noble and non-noble metals serving as the active centers were fully fabricated. Herein, we highlight the CO2RR specific products and structure–performance relationship on both noble and non-noble SACs, issues including synthesis method, chemical structure, and coordination environment, which can help in raising the productivity of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction in future work.

3.2.1 Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO. 
The activation of CO2 molecule to generate *COOH and a suitable strength of CO adsorption enhances the synthesis and desorption of CO, which are the key steps to obtain high CO productivity in CO2RR. Table 2 summarizes the performance of SACs in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO. The non-noble metals of Ni, Co, and Fe have been attracting growing interests in recent years due to their lower costs and outstanding CO2RR performance. To improve the catalytic reaction, various methods have been utilized for the preparation of SACs. The doping of N, S or boosting the interaction of isolated atom and support are usually employed to enhance the process. Zhao et al. synthesized N and S co-coordinated Ni sites employing ultrathin exfoliated NiPS3 as a template to generate a sandwich-like conjugated microporous polymer. The Ni single atom-based porous polymer nanosheets were confirmed to have N/S co-coordination by XAS. The catalyst achieved an FECO of 95% and jCO of −7.8 mA cm−2 (−0.8 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) during the CO2RR. DFT showed that the Ni–N3S single-atom sites are accountable for the high activity of CO2RR.231 Wu's group developed a flexible, self-supported, and controllable H-CPss catalyst including numerous Ni single sites via a solid-state diffusion between the compact bulk Ni metal and loose N-doped carbon (Fig. 10a–c). The scalability of the catalyst not only enables meeting industrial levels but can also be directly employed as a binder-free electrode for CO2RR. In this case, the obtained H-CPs shows an enhanced FECO of 97% and jCO of 48.66 mA cm−2 (−1 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) in 0.5 M KHCO3 solution, which outperforms most of the formerly reported results (Fig. 10d and e). In addition, DFT calculations proved that the Ni sites of NiN4, NiN3, NiN2, and NiN are more anti-oxidation than the Ni cluster. Although COOH* can be easily translated into CO* for both NiNx (x = 1, 2, 3, 4) and Ni309 clusters, CO* desorption from the Ni309 cluster is more difficult (1.13 eV) because of the relatively strong binding of CO*, which is more efficient of Ni SACs for CO2RR to CO (Fig. 10f and g).232 Xi et al. synthesized carbon-supported Ni–Nx SACs by Joule heating by applying the metal–ligand complex adsorbed by carbon black (Fig. 10h–j). Nearly 80% of N species in the catalytic material are coordinated with the Ni active centers. The optimum Ni–Nx illustrates >92% CO selectivity in the range of −0.7 to −1.9 V reversible hydrogen electrode in an H-cell of 0.1 M KHCO3 as the electrolyte. The jCO can reached 70 mA cm−2 in an H-cell at a remarkably negative applied voltage (−1.9 V). It should be pointed out that an activity loss less than 5% after 48 h at −1.5 V could greatly overcome the stability constraint of the SAC.233 In addition, MOF-templated Ni-CN SACs were also reported as promising catalysts for CO2RR. Several MOF-templated Ni–N–C catalysts with controlled Ni–N coordination numbers were synthesized by host–guest cooperative protection method. To fabricate the Ni1–Nx–C catalyst, a bimetallic MgNi-MOF-74 with a high Mg2+/Ni2+ ratio was fabricated to assist the spatial isolation of Ni2+. Polypyrrole filled into the 1D channel of the MOF served as the N source to anchor the Ni single-atom. MgO was then removed by etching to achieve the preparation of the NiSA–Nx–C catalyst (Fig. 10k and l). The NiSA–N2–C catalyst offers an FECO of 98% and TOF of 1622 h−1 at −0.8 V, which is higher than the NiSA–N3–C and NiSA–N4–C catalyst. The CO2RR activity of the Ni SACs significantly relies on their Ni–N coordination environment, which was verified by DFT (Fig. 10m).234 Recently, the Ni–N–C catalyst was investigated among different MOF-templated M–N–C catalysts (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) with an optimal FECO of 96.8% at −0.8 V and no significant loss of activity after 10 h test at −0.8 V. DFT calculation demonstrates that the COOH* species is the rate-limiting step of all M–N–C catalysts, and the Ni–N–C has the lowest energy barrier.235

Active Co SACs were also reported for CO2RR. Zhang et al. reported a solvothermal approach for the scalable synthesis of single-atom metals of Co, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Ni stabilized on Zr6-cluster-porphyrin framework hollow nanocapsules (Fig. 11a–e). The hierarchical porous structure and abundant Co–N4 active centers promote CO2 adsorption and decrease *COOH binding energy strength as well as *CO adsorption energy, thus accelerating CO2-to-CO conversion. The optimum Co–N4 illustrates the FECO of 76.8% at −0.8 V in the 0.1 M KHCO3 solution (Fig. 11f and g).236 Wang et al. reported a single-atom Co–N-C catalyst with CoN4 sites supported on Vulcan XC-72R for CO2RR (Fig. 11h and i). The catalyst obtains outstanding performance with an FECO of 98.7% at −0.66 V, jCO of −33.6 mA cm−2, and CO TOF reaching 27173 h−1 at −0.76 V, which is higher than that of the Ni–N–C catalyst in the same way. In addition, as the solar-driven reaction system consists of a Si solar cell and a flow cell, CoN4-CB demonstrates a markedly high jCO of 98.3 mA cm−2 with an average FECO of 92.1%. DFT suggests that the rate-limiting step for *COOH generation was significantly accelerated on CoN4 sites compared with the NiN4 sites and thus led to a high activity for CO production.237 The CoN5 sites were also determined by EXAFS and DFT, and a high FECO over 90% for Co–N5/HNPCSs catalyst at a wide range from −0.57 to −0.88 V was obtained. The CO2RR of Co SACs was modulated by the coordinated environment.238 Similarly, single-atom Co–Tpy–C catalyst with uniform Co–N4 sites was fabricated through the pyrolysis of the Co terpyridine organometallic complex. The Co–N4 sites exhibited superior performance of CO2RR with an FECO of 98% at −0.7 V. In addition, in gas phase electrolysis, the FECO still exceeded 90% and a high CO partial current density of 86.4 mA cm−2 was also obtained.239

As for Fe single atoms applied for CO2RR, Fe–N–C SACs were successfully fabricated through the thermal pyrolysis of hemin and melamine coadsorbed on graphene. Atomically dispersed FeN5 structure displayed a high FECO of 97% at −0.35 V, while the FeN4 structure was lower FECO of 67%. DFT proved that the electron transferring from the Fe d-orbital to p-orbitals of the pyrrolic N decreases the Fe–CO π back-donation, then leading to comparatively weak CO adsorption at the FeN5 site, resulting in the high production of CO in CO2RR.240 Li et al. prepared FeN4Cl/nitrogen-doped carbon SACs with single Fe atoms axially coordinated by a Cl atom (Fig. 11j and k). DFT revealed that Cl atom can efficiently regulate the electronic structure of FeN4 SACs and facilitate the desorption of CO* to CO, resulting in the substantially boosted activity for CO2RR (Fig. 11n). The optimal FeN4Cl/NC displays an FECO of 90.5%, jCO of 10.8 mA cm−2, and a high CO TOF of 1566 h−1 at 490 mV (Fig. 11l and m).241
Sun et al. incorporated single P atoms into the nitrogen-doped carbon supported Fe SA catalyst and displayed the FECO of 97% and jCO of 5 mA cm−2 at 320 mV over 24 h. DFT and experiments showed that single P atom in the third coordination shell of the Fe center raised the electron density of Fe and markedly caused a drop in the energy barrier in the rate-limiting step for *COOH generation, leading to outstanding CO2RR.182 Recently, Li et al. fabricated the highly dispersed Fe active sites regulated by N and P on commercial carbon black. The Fe–N/P–C catalyst displayed superior catalytic activity for CO2RR to CO with an FECO of 98% and CO TOF of 508.8 h−1 at 0.34 V. Ex situ XAS and DFT revealed that the N and P coordinated single Fe-atom boosts the adsorption and desorption of CO2 and intermediates, facilitates mass transfer, and raises the exposure of more active sites.242 Vijay et al. showed that apart from the ligand binding energies for the Fe–N–C catalyst, the catalytic properties of CO2RR on Fe–N–C SACs can also be adjusted by regulating the dipole-field interactions of CO2 adsorption, which has been already verified to be pH-dependent.243
To broaden the application in CO2RR of SACs, Hao et al. reported a novel catalyst with N-doped carbon nano-onions supports single atomic Zn (Fig. 12a and b), which demonstrates high performance for CO2RR with an FECO of 97% at −0.47 V and extremely high durability (Fig. 12c), which is the best activity and stability for CO2RR over the Zn SACs so far. The engineering interface of the Zn–N4 active center though high curvature CNO support can efficiently enhance the catalytic properties. The reaction routes for complete CO2RR on ZnN/CNO are shown in Fig. 12d.244 Guo et al. demonstrated Sn SACs with atomically dispersed SnN3O1 active sites supported on N-rich carbon matrix (Sn-NOC) by a gas transport method for efficient CO2RR (Fig. 12e and f), which illustrated remarkable activity with a peak FECO of 94% and a partial jCO of 13.9 mA cm−2 at −0.7 V. Compared with Sn-N4 sites in tin phthalocyanine (Sn-Pc), the CO TOF of SnN3O1 active sites in Sn-NOC is 23340.5 h−1, which is 400 times higher than that of the former (57.5 h−1) (Fig. 12g). SnN3O1 coordination is the intrinsically active site for CO2RR through plot the FECOvs. the Sn-N content. DFT and experimental results revealed that the atomic configuration of SnN3O1 decreases the activation energy of *CO2 and *COOH generation while raising the HCOO* generation energy barrier, thus boosting the conversion of CO2 into CO (Fig. 12h).245 Xu et al. fabricated Cu SACs embedded in N-doped graphene (Cu–N4–NG) though a two-step pyrolysis method. HAADF-STEM and XAFS revealed that the Cu atom was atomically dispersed and coordinated via four N atoms (Cu–N4) (Fig. 12i–k). Experimental results demonstrated that Cu–N4–NG provided an FECO of 80.6% at −1.0 V. The kinetics experiments illustrate that the Cu–N4 site boosts CO2 activation, while the graphene substrate improves water dissociation and formation of protons for the CO2RR. DFT further proved that CO2RR is supported on Cu–N4–NG because of the lower thermodynamic barrier (Fig. 12l).246

3.2.2 Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4. 
Cu is one of the most trustworthy metal to catalyze the reaction process of CO2RR toward CH4 to date.275–277 The design of Cu SACs is a promising way to obtain high CH4 products.262,278 Lan and coworkers synthesized a Cu-based cMOF consisting of the extremely conjugated graphene-like ligand (Cu-DBC) to produce CH4 with an FECH4 of ∼80% and jCH4 of −203 mA cm−2 at −0.9 V (Fig. 13a–c). The DFT and experimental results revealed that the Cu-DBC with O-coordinated Cu sites illustrates superior activity and selectivity above the porphyrin Cu–N4 site and phthalocyanine Cu–N4 site ECR catalysts due to the lower energy barriers of Cu–O4 sites during the ECR process (Fig. 13d and e). This research exhibits the powerful reliance of ECR selectivity on the well-defined Cu site structure and offers a platform for the design of ECR catalysts.279 Shi et al. designed the Cu SAs stabilized by graphdiyne (Cu SAs/GDY) for CO2RR (Fig. 13f–h). The adjustment of graphdiyne and the hybridization orbital leads to a change in the Cu SAs electronic structure, whose valence state is higher than that of Cu0. Consequently, Cu SAs are anchored more easily to inhibit aggregation, boost charge transfer, and regulate the intermediates in the reaction, which significantly accelerate the catalytic performance of CO2-to-CH4 conversion over Cu SAs/GDY. The catalyst exhibits a maximum FECH4 of 81% and receives a high partial jCH4 of −243 mA cm−2 in the flow-cell electrolyzer. DFT showed that the Cu–C bond was favorably established due to the unique electronic structure of GDY, thus leading to a change in the Cu SAs electronic structure and boosting the generation of *OCHO intermediates, which are favorable for the generation of CH4 (Fig. 13i).280 Cai et al. illustrated a new partial-carbonization method to fabricate a well-defined Cu SAs with unique CuN2O2 sites stabilized on CDs (Fig. 13j–l). The Cu-CDs catalyst shows an FECH4 of 78% and TOF of 2370 h−1 at −1.44 and −1.64 V, respectively (Fig. 13m). DFT verified that the outstanding catalytic properties on CuN2O2 sites are attributed to the suitable promoted CH4 and H2 energy barrier and the controllable electronic structure of Cu SAs (Fig. 13n).281 Similarly, Chen et al. reported a Cu SAs anchored though the Lewis acid for CO2RR to CH4. DFT suggested that the Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 can also modulate the electronic structure of Cu SAs by controlling intermediate absorption to boost the reaction.263

Co SACs were also researched for CO2-to-CH4. Yang et al. comprehensively explored nitrogen-doped graphene/graphdiyne heterostructure-supported transition metal (TM) (TM-N4@GRA/GDY) for CO2 electroreduction. The computational results revealed that Co–N4@GRA/GDY displays outstanding catalytic activity with quite a low limiting potential of −0.567 V for CO2-to-CH4 conversion due to the powerful electron transfer between the Co atoms and GDY.282 Zn SAs anchored by N-doped carbon was fabricated for the reduction of CO2 to CH4 using multielectron transfer and an FECH4 of 85.5% and partial jCH4 of −31.8 mA cm−2 at −1.8 V are also obtained in 1 M KHCO3 solution. DFT illustrated that Zn SAs substantially prevented the formation of CO and boosted the generation of CH4.265
Lu et al. explored transition metal (TM = Co, V, Fe, Cr, Ni, and Mn) atoms embed in 2D Nb2NO2 as the SACs for ECR by first-principles calculation. The results displayed that Cr, V, and Ni@Nb2NO2 could efficiently improve CO2 adsorption and reduction process. All of TM@Nb2NO2 display high selectivity for CH4. Furthermore, Cr, V, and Ni@Nb2NO2 exhibit low limiting potentials.283 To fully understand the mechanism the catalytic sites of CO2 reduction to CH4, 23 transition metal-coordinated nitrogen-doped carbon M–N4–C and axial O atom-coordinated M–N4O–C single-atom catalysts were researched by PDS and DFT. It was revealed that the route and catalytic activity over M–N4–C are straightforwardly associated with the electronegativity of the chosen metals and d-shell electron numbers. In addition, the axial O atom can alter the coordination structure and restrict potential step, which promotes the stability of M–N4O–C SACs and influences the adsorption capacity of the intermediate, thus enhancing the catalytic activity.284


3.2.3 Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH3OH. 
As for the currently catalytic materials, Cu is the only acknowledged high-efficiency SACs for the production of CH3OH. Zhao et al. reported an effective method to design Cu SAs-anchored MXene for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH3OH through selective etching of atomic-level hybrid Al and Cu layers from quaternary MAX phases (Ti3(Al1−xCux)C2) to methanol via (Al and Cu) due to the different saturated vapor pressures of Al- and Cu-containing products. After the Al layers were selectively etched, Cu SAs was well-maintained and concomitantly stabilized on MXene (Ti3C2Clx) by Cu–O bonds, which demonstrates a high FECH3OH of 59.1% to generate CH3OH and displays remarkable electrocatalytic stability. Based on XAS and DFT, the Cu SAs are coordinated by three O atoms with unsaturated electronic structure (Cuδ+, 0 < δ < 2), which transfers a low energy barrier for the rate-determining step (transformation of HCOOH* to absorbed CHO* intermediate), benefiting electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH3OH.266 He and coworkers also designed a facile method for Cu SAs anchored through-hole carbon nanofibers for CO2RR, which could produce practically pure CH3OH with an FECH3OH of 44% and partial jCH3OH of −39 mA cm−2 as well as over 50 h stability in the liquid phase. DFT revealed that a comparatively higher binding energy for the *CO intermediate was received on Cu SAs and can easily further transform into CH3OH instead of CO product.267


3.2.4 Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to HCOOH. 
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to HCOOH was considered as an ideal CO2 conversion pathway. Lu et al. synthesized In SAs on a nitrogen-doped carbon skeleton for efficient CO2RR to fabricate HCOOH in aqueous media with a HCOOH TOF of 26771 h−1 at −0.99 V (Fig. 14a–d). The loading of In on the carbon support remarkably enhances the CO2RR process. DFT and experimental results proved that the lower energy barrier for the generation of the *OCHO intermediate on isolated In active sites serve as a significant role in the CO2-to-HCOOH process (Fig. 14e and f).270 Qiu's group also fabricated In SACs derived from In-doped ZIF-8, which shows a high total current density from 38.94 to 81.08 mA cm−2 in the wide potential range from −0.91 to −1.41 V for CO2-to-HCOOH with an FEHCOOH of 85.2% at −1.31 V (Fig. 14g–j). Atomically dispersed In SACs exposes more active sites, facilitate reaction rate and faster electron transfer, as well as long-term durability compared with In nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped carbon.269 In addition, single Mo atom supported on ultrathin N-doped graphene was fabricated by Xie's group (Fig. 14k). When 4 mol% ionic liquids were introduced to serve as the electrolytes, the Mo SACs were considerably efficient than traditional N-doped graphene. The FEHCOOH of Mo@NG almost achieved double that of NG and ultimately triple that of NG at −1.4 V. Furthermore, an HCOOH yield of 747 mmol gcatal−1 h−1 in Mo@NG was higher than in NG of 230 mmol gcatal−1 h−1 (Fig. 14l and m).268

The catalytic performance over SACs of the transition metal–phthalocyanine monolayers were comprehensively examined with the help of DFT. The results show that the main products of Sc, Ti, V, and Fe SACs were CH4, Cr, Mn, and Zn SACs, while that of HCOOH and Co was HCHO. In addition, the lowest and highest overpotential were received on Mn and Fe SACs, respectively.285 Li's group prepared a B36-supported atomically dispersed Au could efficiently boost CO2 adsorption and reduction processes by the 2e route to form HCOOH. In addition, an outstanding charge transfer from Au to OCHO was discovered, which well explained why B36Au–OCHO and subsequent HCOOH were mainly products during the CO2RR process.286 Furthermore, the effect of CO2RR catalyzed by single-Fe coordinated though four pyridinic N atoms was fabricated. DFT showed that the 2e CO2RR occurs though the two-order proton-coupled electron transfer process––the proton transfer from the N or C site to CO2 on the FeN4C and simultaneous electron transfer from FeN4C to CO2. More importantly, the oxidation states with various spins of FeN4 can regulate the rate of the PCET process by adjusting the relevant energy barriers and modulating the overpotentials of transformation of *CO2 to *CO/*HCOOH. The energy barrier of 0.72 eV in the rate-limiting step is more favorable for the transformation of CO2 to CO, compared to that of 0.52 eV for the HCOOH generation step catalyzed by FeIIN4CM when the single-Fe is coordinated via four pyridinic N atoms.287 Lambie and coworkers reported the p-block component (Pb, Al, In, Bi, Ga, Sn) and Au-doped graphene-based SACs in the C3-site and N4-site for electrochemical CO2-to-HCOOH. DFT displayed that Sn/C3, Pb/N4, and Pb/C3 were determined to possess the lowest overpotential for HCOOH formation. By contrast, Ga/C3, Al/N4, Al/C3, and Au/C3 were recognized to generate controllable products because of the sufficiently strongly binding of HCOOH.288


3.2.5 Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products. 
C2+ products are more expected because of their high energy density and additional value. Cu have the power to lower the CO intermediate binding energy, which can further convert to the CO intermediate and lead to the following C–C coupling. Even though Cu-based catalysts can convert CO2 into C2+ products, due to the high barriers for CO2 activation and subsequent C–C coupling, electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2 and C2+ products on the SACs still suffer large overpotentials, and the efficient conversion of CO2 into C2+ products over Cu-based catalysts is sparingly reported. Recently, Wen et al. reported an isolated Cu–S on HKUST-1 and S-HKUST-1 though the local S doping method, which displays a fairly high C2H4 selectivity with a peak FEC2H4 of 60.0% at an H-type cell, and transfers a jC2H4 of 400 mA cm−2 with an FEC2H4 of 57.2% in a flow cell (Fig. 15a–c). XAFS showed that the Cuδ+ species was anchored via the Cu–S motif during CO2RR. In addition, DFT further proved that because of the moderate distance of optimal adsorption energy and coupling sites, the anchored Cuδ+ at the Cu/CuxSy interface is beneficial for the coupling of the *CO intermediate.289 Meng and coworkers fabricated a tandem catalytic method by uniformly dispersing Cu NPs on PTF(Ni) containing the atomically dispersed Ni–N sites to boost the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2H4, which leads to an FEC2H4 of 57.3% and partial jC2H4 of 3.1 mA cm−2 at −1.1 V, approximately six times greater than that of the non-tandem catalyst (main CH4 product) (Fig. 15d–f). Operando ATR-FTIR and DFT demonstrated that a high concentration of local CO produced via PTF(Ni) sites was beneficial to the synthesis of C2H4 by promoting C–C coupling on the vicinal Cu NP sites (Fig. 15g). This study gives a potential approach to fabricate high-efficiency tandem electrocatalysts for CO2RR to produce C2H4 products.274

Xu et al. fabricated carbon-supported Cu SAs employing the amalgamated Cu–Li strategy and displayed attractive features for the transformation of CO2-to-C2H5OH with an FECH3CH2OH of ∼91% at −0.7 V and an FECH3CH2OH of ∼15% at an onset potential of −0.4 V (Fig. 15h and i). Furthermore, the FECH3CH2OH of the catalysts still remained at ∼90% after 16 h. The superior FECH3CH2OH is mainly attributed to the initial dispersion of Cu SAs. Operando XAS and DFT displayed that atomic dispersion plays a vital role in the dynamic conversion among Cu SA and Cun during the CO2RR reaction (Fig. 15j). The surface hydroxyl group serves as a significant function in tuning the influences among the carbon supports and catalytic center.271 Karapinar and coworkers fabricated a Cu SACs with CuN4 coordination by the conventional pyrolytic pathway, which displays a faradaic yield of 55% at −1.2 V for CO2-to-C2H5OH conversion in 0.1 M CsHCO3. Most importantly, a faradaic yield of 80% for CO2RR to C2H5OH and C2H4 was obtained. The isolated CuN4 sites temporarily transform to Cu nanoparticles and later transform back to the CuN4 structure after electrolysis, which is further supported by XAS.272
To efficiently reduce CO2 to CH3COCH3 products, Zhao et al. reported that Cu SAs is stabilized on N-doped porous carbon (Cu–SA/NPC) by hydrothermal synthesis and subsequent carbonization for efficient and selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CH3COCH3 with an FE of 36.7% and a maximum production rate of 336.1 μg h−1 (Fig. 15k–n). DFT showed that the outstanding activity and controllable selectivity were particularly attributed to the unique Cu-pyrrolic-N4 active sites (Fig. 15o), which decreased the energy barriers for CO2 activation and C–C coupling because of the Cu–N synergistic effect, thus leading to the efficient production of CH3COCH3.290
Overall, a series of metal SACs stabilized by carbon or N-doped carbon have been comprehensively fabricated via various synthesis strategies (Table 2). The SACs of Ni, Co, Fe, Pd, Cu, display superior performance for the efficient and selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO, CH4, CH3OH, HCOOH, C2H4, C2H5OH, and CH3COCH3. The high FEproduct and jproduct are primarily due to the unique structures of SACs. The catalytic activity and selectivity of SACs were significantly influenced by the binding energies of CO, CO2, and intermediates (*CO, *HCOOH,*OCHO, etc.). As mentioned above, the FECO on Fe SACs was remarkably boosted at low CO binding energies, while Cu SACs demonstrated the two-electron reduction route for the FE to CH3OH at high CO binding energies. The high strength of CO2 adsorption over SACs surface may also facilitate the CO2RR performance. In addition, the catalytic properties of SACs are also extremely influenced except the local environment of the single atom active center and the best coordination types and numbers; the reaction conditions are also the key factors. For example, the potential and current density for CO formation via the electrochemical reduction of CO2 is known to depend on the type of cell used, the composition and concentration of the electrolyte, as well as the rate mass transfer to and from the cathode. From these aspects, further work is still needed to be carried out in the future.

3.3 SACs for photocatalytic CO2 reduction
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction by available solar energy and water is considered to be one of the most potential approaches because of the renewable sunlight, valuable carbonaceous products (such as CH4, HCOOH, C2H4, and CH3OH,), mild conditions (atmospheric temperature and pressure), and controllable reaction and extensible for industrial utilization.310–313 A series of catalysts of metal oxides, organic and inorganic complexes, MXenes, and carbon-based materials have been massively investigated by researchers (Table 3). However, because of the high chemical inertness of CO2, a large amount of energy is required for the transformation process, thus resulting in limited photocatalysts that are effective for CO2 reduction by applying solar energy. Herein, we emphasize the CO2RR specific products and structure–performance relationship on both noble and non-noble SACs, issues including synthesis method, chemical structure, and coordination environment, which can help in raising the productivity of photocatalytic CO2 reduction in future work.

3.3.1 Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO. 
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO has enormously attracted great attention by the use of metal SAs in catalysts. An efficient photocatalyst should have a low energy barrier route and high selectivity as far as the product formed is concerned. Cheng et al. fabricated a FeN4/K-g-C3N4 with spatially confined Fe SA and K ion by one-step molten salt-assisted method, which displayed a 20 μmol g−1 h−1 conversion rates and almost 100% selectivity for CO2 to CO. Based on characterizations and DFT, Fe SA bonded with four N atoms act as the active center for CO2 absorption and activation. Because of appropriate diameters, the K ions decorated in the g-C3N4 interlayers could productively boost charge transfer and separation. In addition, the spatial confinements of Fe SA and K ions embedded in g-C3N4 dramatically improved the catalytic performance for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO.297 Similarly, through the pyrolysis of superthin Co metal–organic layers (MOLs) nanosheets, the single-Co(II) sites were atomically dispersed on g-C3N4 (Fig. 16a–c). Interestingly, this photocatalyst demonstrates a superior photocatalytic CO2-to-CO transformation with the CO evolution rate of 464.1 μmol g−1 h−1, 3 times higher than that of the bulky Co-MOF (Fig. 16d).292 Confronting the reinforcement of photocatalytic activity on g-C3N4 by employing the metal single atom is markedly restricted because of the various morphologies and the overdose defects of amorphous g-C3N4. Li et al. designed a g-C3N4 nanorod-stabilized Cu SA via molten salts and reflux strategy with a CO evolution rate of 3.086 μmol g−1 h−1 in the absence of any sacrificial reagent or co-catalyst (Fig. 16e–h). As the adsorption site of CO2, Cu SA can be greatly employed to raise the CO2 adsorption ability on Cu-CCN. DFT revealed that photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO is an entropy-reducing evolution, while CO2 reduction to CH4 is an entropy-raising evolution (Fig. 16i). Consequently, the Cu SACs demonstrated almost 100% selectivity for photocatalytic CO2 to CO conversion.299 Dong et al. fabricated an amorphous ZrO2 nanowires-supported Pt SACs and displayed an outstanding CO yielding rate of 16.61 μmol g−1 h−1 and selectivity of 97.6%. The amorphous features support the catalyst with natural sufficient defects. In addition, ZrOPt charge bridges approve high-speed photoelectron transfer, which together enhanced the catalytic performance.294

A high photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency under UV illumination was received on a SACs with commercial super conductive carbon black (SP)-stabilized Co SA. The atomically dispersed Co was anchored on SP to generate Co-SA@SP-800 (Fig. 16j and k), which presented significantly improved the photocatalytic CO2RR performance with a CO yielding rate of 16400 μmol g−1 h−1 and CO selectivity of 84.2% on stream for 2 h and surpassing most of the CO2-to-CO photocatalytic SACs recently published (Fig. 16l). Characterization and DFT showed that the atomically dispersed Co–N4 active sites remarkably reduce the energy barrier of CO* desorption in the CO2-to-CO process; simultaneously, H2 evolution also was restricted (Fig. 16m).295 Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) have unexpectedly appeared to serve as the photosensitive material because of the controllable light collection characteristics. He et al. encapsulated Co SA in the pores of CTFs receive electrons for photocatalytic CO2-to-syngas with a yield of 330.3 μmol g−1 h−1 on stream 10 h. The Co SA-coordinated active centers approbate the light-generated electrons obtained from CTF and efficiently for CO2 reduction through an adsorption–activation–reaction mechanism.296 Chen et al. stabilized Co SA on Ti3C2Tx NSs by the C and O anchor sites on the surface of Ti3C2Tx. The single Co atom tremendously boosts the catalytic performance with an optimized CO yielding rate of 6060 μmol g−1 h−1 as well as evolving H2. The high conductive channels of Ti3C2Tx can accomplish the efficient transfer of light-generated electrons of light absorbers to Co SA sites. DFT displayed that Co SA coordinated with Ti3C2Tx can efficaciously raise the formation of CO, which is mainly attributed to raised CO2 adsorption and reduce the Gibbs free energy of generation.293
Recently, Li et al. favorably fabricated with an Eu3+ SAs-decorated CdS/InVO4 Type-II heterojunction via hydrothermal and in situ preparation method, which has superior photocatalytic CO2RR performance. XPS revealed that the peaks of 10-CdS/IVO:Eu3+ to O 1s, V 2p, In 3d, and Eu 3d were slightly shifted down to a low energy position; simultaneously, the peaks of Cd 3d and S 2p dropped to a position of high binding energy, which convincingly demonstrated that the transfer of electrons was from CdS to IVO due to the assistance of Eu3+. The CdS/IVO4:Eu3+ achieved an optimized CO yielding rate of 11.02 μmol g−1 h−1, nearly 2.4-fold and 1.9-fold higher than that of InVO4 and CdS, respectively. At the same time, the CH4 yielding rate of 8.24 μmol g−1 h−1 was also achieved for CdS/IVO4:Eu3+, 5.3-fold and 10.6-fold higher than that of InVO4 and CdS, respectively. DFT showed that Eu3+ SA can modify InVO4 and activate CO2 molecules but can also promote charge separation between the interface and improve the photocatalytic performance.304 Analogously, Wang's group reported Er SACs stabilized on carbon nitride nanotubes (CN-NT) with a high Er loading of 20.1 wt%. Er1/CN-NT displayed superior photocatalytic CO2RR properties with CO and CH4 yielding rates of 47.1 μmol g−1 h−1 and 2.5 μmol g−1 h−1. Uniformly dispersed Er SA helped in the outstanding photocatalytic CO2RR process, which has been identified by in situ XAFS and DFT.314


3.3.2 Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4. 
For photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4, countless efforts have been made. As we all know, this reaction is an exceptional multi-electron conversion process, which should establish high standards for photocatalyst design: (1) active centers must have the ability to accumulate affluent light-generated electrons to enhance the reaction process; (2) the H atoms formed from H2O must be transferred on priority to the metal active sites for the adsorption and activation of CO2, thus timely generating C–H bonds rather than processing H2 evolution. Therefore, the reasonable design of metal sites in conjunction with semiconductor choice is extremely essential to obtain a high yield of CH4via photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Cheng et al. perfectly fabricated Co SA stabilized on CeO2via the atomic-scale tuning method, which greatly benefit the photocatalytic process of CO2-to-CH4 conversion. The Co inserted into CeCo bimetallic is the essential characteristic enhancing a powerful electron transfer channel by S-scheme heterojunctions. In addition, Co decorated into CeO2 is indicated to have a significant impact on charge regulation and improve the power of electrons from the PTI donations to Co sites, thus promoting electronic assignability for CH4 generation. Noticeably, an unprecedented CH4 yielding rate of 181.7 μmol g−1 h−1 and selectivity of 88.3% were obtained using CeCo-PTI, which is 31 times and 121 times compared to that of Ce-PTI and PTI, respectively.315 To enhance the process, Pt SA encapsulated in ethylene glycol (EG)-regulated CTF-1 with Pt–N(C) sites was fabricated though photo-deposition way by Bi's group (Fig. 17a–c). Pt-SA/CTF-1 can both improve the higher adsorption and activation of CO2 as well as boost the higher transfer and separation of light-generated carriers, thus leading to an excellent CH4 yielding rate almost 26- and 4-fold higher compared with CTF-1 and Pt-NP/CTF-1, respectively (Fig. 17d and e). Furthermore, the feasible mechanism for photocatalytic CO2-to-CH4 conversion on Pt-SA/CTF-1 was also proposed.301

For the competitive reactions, Xiong's group reasonably constructed a synthetic strategy for modulating the Pt SA partial environment to build a Pt-CN catalyst with CH4 yielding rate of 6.3 μmol g−1 h−1 and CH4 selectivity of 99% (Fig. 17f–h). The defects and –OH were also produced for abundant CO2 on the surface. In addition, the atomically dispersed Pt atoms were coordinated with CN for localizing light-generated electrons to boost the activation of CO2 and favor the generation of CH4. Significantly, Pt SA greatly decreased the reaction energy barrier for the rate-limiting step, thus boosting the reaction and raising the *CO desorption energy, which dramatically improved the CH4 yielding rate (Fig. 17i).316
Considering the merit of dual-metal single atom, Pan er al. fabricated a dual SA of Pt and Cu decorated on self-doped-TiO2 nanotubes (Pt–Au/R-TNTs). By the MSI, Pt and Cu were dispersed on the defect-rich TNTs, which greatly enhanced the process of CO2 to CO2˙− conversion and then immediately followed by the generation of CH3˙ intermediates. Subsequently, CH3˙ combines with H to yield of CH4 or further combines with CH3˙ to yield C2H6. Pt–Au/R-TNTs displays a CH4 and C2H6 yielding rate of 360 and 28.8 μmol g−1 h−1 with a Pt–Au loading of 0.33 wt%, respectively.317 Similarly, Xiang's group reported the Pt–Cu dual-single-atoms-supported N vacancy-rich crystalline g-C3N4. The N-vacancies served as minitriming subnanometer cavities to anchor the atomically dispersed Pt and Cu SA. More importantly, PtCu-crCN displays a CH4 yielding rate of 2.8 μmol g−1 h−1 with a Pt loading of 0.32 wt%, which is much higher than that of Pt-crCN, Cu-crCN, and crCN.318


3.3.3 Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH3OH. 
CH3OH is widely used as a raw material for the synthesis of added value fuels and chemicals. Because of the thermodynamic constraints and the nonuniformity of active sites during practical operations, the byproducts are simultaneously formed during photocatalytic CO2 reduction, thus leading to the relatively low activity of CH3OH yield on the current catalysts. The design of high-performance catalysts of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH3OH is fundamentally expected and still remains a significant challenge.319 Fortunately, the reaction can be accurately regulated by changing the coordinated environment and electronic properties of the metal single-atom sites, leading to a significantly efficient photocatalytic yield of CO2 to CH3OH and other valuable products.
Ma et al. prepared Co/g-C3N4 SACs with Co–N2C active sites and ultrahigh Co loading of 24.6 wt% via the pyrolysis-induced vaporization method (Fig. 18a and b). Atomically dispersed Co–N2C sites stabilized on g-C3N4 served as electron collection centers and enhance the adsorption and activation of CO2 during the photocatalysis, thus leading to a high CH3OH yield of 235.5 μmol g−1 h−1(Fig. 18c), which was 13.4 and 2.2-fold greater than that of g-C3N4 and CoOx/g-C3N4, respectively. It is noteworthy that H2, CO, CH4, C2H4, C3H6, and CH3OCH3 were also obtained over Co/g-C3N4-0.2 SACs with a yield of 18.9, 2.9, 3.4, 1.1, 1.4, and 3.3 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively. Furthermore, an excellent stability of 12 cycles at ∼48 h was also achieved.305 As shown in Fig. 18d–g, Ru SA decorated on mC3N4 was reported for the photocatalytic transformation of CO2 into CH3OH and received a high CH3OH yield of 250 μmol g−1 h−1 with Ru loading of 0.4 wt% under visible light. EXAFS showed the N-coordination environment for the Ru SA active center, which served as a bridge promoting easier electron transfer, boosting the charge density of Ru, and a dramatic decrease in the barrier of carrier transfer, further improving the photocatalytic process of CO2 to CH3OH with H2O as the electron donor. The results obviously account the prospects of Ru SA-doped photocatalyst RuSA-mC3N4 for CO2 transformation and increasing the light-harvesting quality.302

MOF-derived SACs also displayed promising photocatalytic CO2RR. Redesigning the MOF into a metal complex is a highly effective approach for synthesizing photocatalysts. The pyrolysis-treated MOFs merely contain a few metal sites and also reduce the gas adsorption ability. Consequently, to overcome these problems, decorating the initial MOF-matrix materials is an extremely suitable method. Wang's group designed Cu SA onto the UiO-66-NH2 MOF support through photoinduction (Fig. 18h). Cu SA generation was validated by the STEM image and EXAFS (Fig. 18i–k). Significantly, Cu SAs/UiO-66-NH2 displayed the solar-driven transformation of CO2 to CH3OH and C2H5OH with a yield rate of 5.33 and 4.22 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively, which were far better than that of the UiO-66-NH2 and Cu NPs/UiO-66-NH2 samples (Fig. 18i). DFT demonstrated that Cu SAs/UiO-66-NH2 dramatically boosted the transformation of CO2 to CHO* and CO* intermediates, thus causing the outstanding production of CH3OH and C2H5OH (Fig. 18m). The work offers a novel understanding at the atomic level to fabricate a high efficiency photocatalyst for CO2RR.306


3.3.4 Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to HCOOH. 
As for the product of HCOOH, a high-efficiency gas-permeable porous MOF membranes has been reported by regulating the electronic structures and photocatalytic reactivity with Ir and Pd SAs as the catalytic centers for CO2 and O2 under moderate conditions (Fig. 19a–c). The defect-engineered MOF can boost the light-harvesting ability and modulate the chemical characteristics to considerably adjust the interactions with Ir or Pd SAs. Because of the fairly strong SMSI, Ir1/A-aUiO displayed a high selectivity of HCOOH during photocatalytic CO2RR. By contrast, Ir NPs decorated onto A-aUiO only obtained an inferior selectivity of 16.5% toward HCOOH. In addition, the GMG installation generated by the multiple pores of SA/MOF membranes greatly boost the efficient diffusion of CO2 to the Ir SAs located at the tremendous gas–solid interfaces (Fig. 19d and e). Besides, the construction of high diffusing gas–solid interface can greatly raise the usefulness of reactants in the neighborhood of active centers in contrast to the conventional gas–liquid–solid interface. Combining the advantages of the reaction interface and the single-atom catalytic center, Ir1/A-aUiO obtained a high HCOOH yield of 3.38 μmol g−1 h−1, which was 6.5 and 338-fold higher than that of the Ir1/A-aUiO particles and Ir NPs/A-aUiO, respectively (Fig. 19f).309

3.3.5 Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products. 
Until recently, the extensive research on SACs for photocatalytic CO2 reduction has mainly focused on generating CO and CH4 but no C2 and C2+ chemicals due to the restrictions for multi-electron or proton transfer and the following C–C coupling step. Consequently, it is essential to ameliorate SACs for C–C coupling to higher carbon products. Based on the well-distributed hexagonal pores, the support of h′-HxWO3 was chosen to stabilize the Cu SAs with a loading of 3 wt%, which leads to excellent photocatalytic performance for CO2 to CH3COOH by Wang's group. As shown in Fig. 19g and h, the suspension of blue h′-HxWO3 turns pale after the addition of Cu because of electron transfer from W5+ to Cu2+. Simultaneously, the portion of Cu2+ was also reduced to Cuδ+ (0 < δ < 2), then followed by hydrolysis with OH, and finally anchored the unique surface of 2D h′-HxWO3 in the form of W–O–Cuδ+. Furthermore, the stable and similar coordination environment for the isolated SA Cu+ species, containing the suitable space of the Cu sites, greatly enhanced the CO2 adsorption and activation, thus causing the high efficiency to catalyze C–C coupling. As expected, Cu/WO3 markedly improved the activity of CH3COOH with a yield rate of 2.87 μmol g−1 h−1 and selectivity of 67%, which also shows an excellent structural stability after five cycles of testing (Fig. 19i and j). The reaction mechanism on the Cu/WO3 catalyst surface was also presented (Fig. 19k).320
It was reported that the generation of CxHy on the photocatalytic CO2RR usually contains two processes: (a) CO2 adsorption, followed by reduction from CO2 to CO; (b) hydrogenation, followed by coupling with the adsorbed CO. An efficient CO2 reduction to C2H4 under visible light was also presented on SACs with COF-supported Mo single atoms.308 The atomically dispersed MoN2 sites were concentrate on COF to generate the Mo-COF SACs by the chemical impregnation strategy (Fig. 19l). The Mo-COF presented substantially enhanced photocatalytic CO2RR performance with a C2H4 evolution rate of 3.57 μmol g−1 h−1 and selectivity of 42.92%, while only CO is formed as the product of g-C3N4 and COF (Fig. 19m). From the band structure in Fig. 19n, Mo-COF displays a more negative CBM than COF, which indicates that Mo-COF has a stronger capability of transforming the reduced products. Most importantly, this is the first time that C2H4 has been generated from CO2 reduction over COF. In addition, in situ FT-IR and DFT showed that Mo SA decorated into the COF structure can boost CO adsorption and activation, thus accelerating the subsequent hydrogenation process and further decreasing the energy barriers for C2H4 generation. As mentioned above, C2H5OH, C2H6, C3H6, and CH3OCH3 were also obtained along with a large amount CO or CH4, which has also been discussed above.
In summary, SACs offer countless opportunities for boosting photocatalytic CO2 reduction by facilitating charge separation, improving the charge transfer of photoelectron, and raising the energy of CO2 adsorption. Moreover, the summarized studies in Table 3 demonstrate that the facilitation effects of SACs have been employed to utilize the 2-electron route to synthesize CO and 8-electron route to synthesize CH4, including the conversion of liquid chemicals such as CH3OH, HCOOH, and C2H5OH. Besides, a suitable metal center and carrier are also significant for optimum charge separation capability.

3.4 SACs for thermocatalytic CO2 conversion

3.4.1 CO2 reforming of methane. 
DRM is an attractive pathway to make use of CO2 and CH4 toward CO/H2, which are highly appropriate for CH3OH and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis.321,322 The process is forcefully endothermic (Table 1); to activate CO2 and CH4, fairly high reaction temperature (>700 °C) for catalysts is usually needed.323 DRM has been researched broadly over several catalysts in view of noble metals (Ir, Rh, Ru, Pt, and Pd)324,325 and transition metals (Ni, Co, etc.).326,327 By contrast, transition metals are more affordable and more effective but are also incline prone to deactivation via carbon deposition (coking) and/or sintering with the reactions of CH4 decomposition (CH4 ↔ C + 2H2) and Boudouard reaction (2CO ↔ CO2 + C).328,329 The size of the metal particles during high temperature DRM is a significant parameter for activity, selectivity, and thermal stability as well as coke resistance. Recent investigations have displayed that the smaller size or single-atom metals is extremely needed to take full advantage of atomic efficiency and restrain carbon deposition. Considering that well-defined Ni SACs has been widely identified as a most promising candidate for DRM because of the low cost and sufficient activity. Akri et al. fabricated Ni SA and Ni NP decorated onto hydroxyapatite (HAP) though the SEA method. Ni SACs displayed outstanding coke-resistance and high atomic utilization with a reaction rate of CO2 and CH4 equal to 1186.2 mol gNi−1 h−1 and 816.5 mol gNi−1 h−1, respectively, which is considerably higher than that of Ni NPs at 750 °C. In addition, the deactivation for Ni SACs is primarily due to the sintering and aggregation of Ni SA instead of carbon deposition. The stability was also greatly boosted because of PVP assistance in the synthesis of Ni SACs. In spite of Ni NPs being more coke resistance than Ni SACs, a mass of carbon is also deposited during the process. Significantly, CH4 was decomposed on Ni NPs, followed by the gasification of carbon deposition with CO2, which contributed to the formation of CO.330
Oxygen vacancies (Ov) were successfully controlled over the surface of CeO2 though the substitution of Ce4+ by doping numerous smaller-sized cations M (M = Mg, Co, and Zn) and fabricated using the precipitation-hydrothermal strategy. As shown in Fig. 20a–f, the nanorod structure of Ni1/CoCe was obtained and some darker atoms marked with pink circles around the bright Ce atoms were acknowledged as the Ni single atoms (Fig. 20b). Moreover, the DFT results show that the modification of Co atoms over CeO2 can enable guide location shifting and Ov (Fig. 20d). Compared with Zn and Mg, Co is the more profitable for Ov generation and further enhances the adsorption and activation of CO2 (Fig. 20i and j). Maximum Ov in the catalyst was obtained with outstanding activity and a TOFCH4 of 14.5 s−1 (Fig. 20g and h). When the Ov content was raised to 30.8%, the maintenance of activity at 96.5% on stream 150 h and the quantity of carbon deposition was reduced about 50%. The activated C–H via Ni SACs and the activated CO2 by Ov were synergistically constructed, which led to superior properties in terms of CH4 transformation and high efficiency carbon elimination process in the Ov-SAC catalyst.331 Similarly, Shen et al. also revealed the synergistic effect of the Pt-SACs active sites and the adjacent Olattice/Vo over the interface of Pt–CeO2–R for the transformation of CH4 to CO, and the maintained Vo is recovered though the dissociation of CO2. Pt–CeO2–R demonstrates a superior CO yield rate of 22.7 mmol gcat−1 h−1 for DRM at 350 °C.332

Because Ni atoms in SACs are definitely lower than the threshold size of coke resistance in DRM, Qiao's group displayed that Ni SA dispersed on HAP-Ce is dramatically active and fully coke-resistant in DRM at 750 °C. As shown in Fig. 20k–o, with the increase in Ni loading, Ni clusters (∼1 nm) and nanoparticles (∼1–2 nm) are generated, which enlarge to form small (1–3 nm) and large (5–10 nm) nanoparticles after 500 °C H2 reduction for 10Ni/HAP-Ce. In addition, 0.5Ni1/HAP-Ce demonstrates a specific rate of CH4 and CO2 of 373.1 and 729.2 mol gNi−1 h−1, respectively, which is much higher than that of the Ni clusters (∼1 nm) and Ni nanoparticles. The modification of Ce into HAP leads to the generation of SMSI, which can anchor Ni SA to sintering and then enhance the activation of the C–H bond in CH4, thus causing a high catalytic activity and excellent stability of 100 h with negligible carbon deposition (Fig. 20p and q).333
However, SACs have been displayed to be inferior to NPs because of its high valent state. For example, Yao's group revealed that Rh NPs in the Rh2O3-based form Rh-LTO (La2Ti2O7) displayed outstanding catalytic activity and long-period stability in DRM, while Rh SA-based Rh-LZO (La2Zr2O7) was considered to be useless in DRM for fast carbon deposition, even though Rh SA demonstrated excellent catalytic activity in CH4 activation. Furthermore, the coexistence of Rh0 and RhOx, along with the variation of Ti 2p and Rh 3d binding energy over Rh-LTO, boosted electron transfer to enhance O* migration. Besides, Rh-LTO built with Ov could firstly enhance the activation of CO2, thus enhancing the coke-resistance of the catalyst (see Table 4).334

3.4.2 Thermocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation to CO. 
As for CO2 hydrogenation to CO, Qin's group fabricated Co SACs using Co2+ SA stabilized on SBA-15 with a loading of 2.6 wt% though atomic layer deposition, which displays a high CO selectivity of 99% and a TOF of 304.6 molCO2 molCo−1 h−1 at 600 °C over 500 h. In addition, the excellent performance is mainly due to the SMSI between Co SA and SBA-15 via the Co–O–Si bonds that maintain the Co2+ valence state in the reaction. DFT revealed that the reaction involved the H-assisted dissociation of CO2 over Co SA sites and the generation of CO and H2O. The Co2+ SAs transfer between the tetrahedral and the octahedral field was beneficial for the catalytic cycle.335 Mo SA with a MoN3 structure stabilized on N-doped porous carbon (Mo/NC) for the loading of 7.1 wt% was prepared for CO2 hydrogenation to CO, which obtains a ∼100% selectivity under CO2 conversion of 46.3% at 500 °C and 0.069 MPa of H2 partial pressure. Mo SAs is determined to boost the activation and reduction of CO2 to CO*. Moreover, the maximum transition state energy for CO generation is 0.82 eV and lower than CH4 generation of 2.16 eV, which is in favor of the formation of CO. The outstanding performance of Mo SA was higher than that of MoOx particles, the CO selectivity remains over 90% on stream 68 h without a reduction in the transformation of CO2.346
Dostagir et al. used Co SA stabilized in ZrO2 with a high loading of 15 atom% for the RWGS process. Because of the out-off-balance charge, numerous Ov were generated, which boosted the adsorption of CO2 with the increase in Co loading, causing a high selectivity of CO up to 97% via the formate intermediate. Moreover, Co3O4 generation for Co loading up to 50% enhanced the methanation activity.347 Millet et al. substituted for 1–10 atom% Ni over MgO with atomic dispersion and was almost stabilized on the surface though a solid solution strategy. XPS and DFT showed that the Ni ions approved the low coordination number, which reduced the adsorption energy of CO2. In addition, the CO selectivity was greatly limited by RWGS over the Ni SACs and the 2e− redox was offered, while the multielectron process to CH3OH or CH4 were needed over the clusters. Significantly, after Ni sintering at 350 °C, a high CO generation rate was obtained with the byproduct of CH4 generation in CO2 hydrogenation.348
Jimenez et al. demonstrated Co SA/SiO2 catalyst with a tetrahedral Co2+ coordination environment for CO2 hydrogenation. The Co SACs have a high selectivity toward CO of >95% below 550 °C and low activity. Co clusters and large Co NPs were generated by regulating the reduction temperature, while the chemical structure of the Co species was obviously adjusted, which further boosted CO2 conversion.349 Szanyi and coworkers showed that the application prospect of Pt SA in catalytic conversion is originally covered via the saturated coordination of TiO2, which enables turn on through a reduction–oxidation cycle. In addition, it regulated the reducing atmosphere to stabilize the Pt SA and the generated small and amorphous Pt species could be redispersed to Pt SA via mild oxidation. Compared with fresh Pt SACs, the Pt SA obtained via redispersion displays lower coordination with surface O, thus leading to a higher catalytic activity in the RWGS process.336


3.4.3 Thermocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation to CH4. 
In terms of the reaction, the supports of porous hexagonal boron nitride (pBN) were applied to stabilize atomic Ru, which greatly boosted the activity and selectivity for CO2 hydrogenation to CH4. The vacuum filtration method enables the Ru precursor to rapidly anchor on pBN, where atomically dispersed Ru can be limited over the defects by B, N coordination. Furthermore, the valence state of atomically dispersed Ru was reduced by B, N coordination. DFT also verified that the low valence state of Ru is significant for the dramatically promotion of CH4 generation. The catalyst with Ru SA loading of 0.58 wt% displays a high selectivity of CH4 to 93.5%, stability on stream 110 h, and a reaction rate of 1.86 mmolCO2 gcat−1 s−1 at 350 °C,1.0 MPa, which were higher than that for Ru nanoparticle catalysts.338
Zhang's group demonstrated a CeO2 nanowire-stabilized Ru SA, Ru nanoclusters (∼1.2 nm), and large Ru NPs (∼4.0 nm) for low-temperature CO2 hydrogenation to CH4. Interestingly, the nanoclusters provided 98–100% selectivity toward methanation with a TOF of 7.41 × 10−3 s−1 at 190 °C. Negative CO2 reaction sequence reduces the absolute values from Ru SA into Ru nanoclusters and becomes positive in Ru NPs; at the same time, the positive H2 reaction sequence occurs in the opposite direction. In situ DRIFTS showed that the main reaction route is the CO pathway and the metal carbonyls are significant intermediates, while the active sites of Ce3+–OH and Ru close to the Ru–CeO2 interfaces are responsible for CO2 dissociation and carbonyl hydrogenation, respectively. Besides, the most powerful SMSI and H-spillover influences are separately met with stabilized Ru SA and Ru NPs, along with metal carbonyl activation and the dehydration of the carrier surfaces being restrained. The two aspects achieve a dynamic equilibrium for CeO2-stabilized Ru nanoclusters, and then the catalytic activity is maximized.350
The Pt/CeO2 SACs uniquely synthesized CO in the temperature range of 300–450 °C. On the other hand, Pt/CeO2 NC forms CO only at 300 °C, while CH4 begins forming at 350 °C and reached 100% at 450 °C. As for the catalytic activity, the Pt/CeO2 SACs exhibited excellent CO2 transformation efficiency and achieved 7.2-fold higher performance than the corresponding NC over various temperatures.351


3.4.4 Thermocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation to HCOOH. 
To deeply understand the reaction mechanism and intrinsic activity of CO2 hydrogenation to HCOOH on SACs, Sun's group provided several SA noble metals stabilized over SiO2 and identified the stability for CO2 hydrogenation with the help of DFT. DFT revealed that Ru@SiO2 is favored for HCOOH generation through the hydrogenation of *CO2 to *HCOO with an energy barrier of 23.9 kcal mol−1. A tremendously linear relationship of both the catalytic activity and the charge of the central metal was also found.352 Similarly, Ni SA stabilized over Ov defected Ti3C2O2 (Ni@Ti3C2O2) also favorable HCOOH generation and then quick desorption during the reaction process because of the smallest desorption barrier.353 Furthermore, Cu SA-decorated C2N monolayer (Cu/C2N) for CO2 hydrogenation to HCOOH was also investigated by DFT. It was found that the reaction can occur from the original co-adsorption of H2 and CO2 over Cu/C2N (H2 + CO2@Cu/C2N) and the adsorption of H2 over Cu/C2N (H2@Cu/C2N), respectively. Most importantly, the hydrogenation of CO2 to HCOOH could be obtained over Cu/C2N at room temperature.354
Huang's group fabricated a porous organic polymer-stabilized Ir SACs (Ir/AP-POP) via the wet impregnation and reduction strategy (Fig. 21a) for liquid-phase CO2 hydrogenation to HCOOH, which obtains a TON up to 6784 at 120 °C and 8.0 MPa, greatly higher than the TONs of 1.25%Ir/AC and 1.5%Ir/C3N4 NPs (Fig. 21b). In addition, the Ir/AP-POP SACs can be renewed via centrifugation and almost no activity loss (Fig. 21c). Spectral characterization and DFT show that the chemical structure of the Ir SA site is similar to the homogeneous Ir catalyst (Fig. 21d). These findings displayed that Ir SACs have a high prospect to transform CO2 into value-added products than the corresponding Ir NPs.83

CeO2 nanostructure-anchored Rh SA (Rh-SAs/CeO2) was fabricated as an efficient catalyst for the hydrogenation of CO2 to HCOOH (Fig. 21e and f). As expected, Rh SACs provided a TON as high as 221 at 200 °C, which was 4 times that for Rh-NPs/CeO2. Most importantly, the HCOOH selectivity of Rh SACs was up to 85%, which was better than that of Rh NPs (46%). It was considered that Rh SACs tremendously enhanced the catalytic performance. Furthermore, compared with Rh NPs, Rh SA restrained the dissociation of HCOOH to CO, thus accelerating the generation of HCOOH more efficiently (Fig. 21g).355
Many studies display a higher catalytic performance of SACs in CO2 hydrogenation to HCOOH than the corresponding NPs. Nevertheless, SACs have been identified to be relatively poor to NPs because of their high valent state. Yan's group synthetized Pd NPs/CeO2 with a TOF of 366 molFA molsurf. Pd h−1, which was 9-fold higher than that of Pd SACs/CeO2 of 41 molFA molsurf. Pd h−1 for CO2 hydrogenation to HCOOH. These studies indicate that because of the simple activated CO2 toward carbonaceous species, thus the rate-determining step is mainly determined by the hydrogenation step, which is regulated by the Pd species. Moreover, the Pd SACs/CeO2 displayed inferior hydrogenation activity because of the superior valence state and the absence of Pd–Pd adjacent sites compared with Pd NPs/CeO2. This work demonstrates that exploring the reaction active sites and rate-determining process are significant for preparing an appropriate catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation.339


3.4.5 Thermocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH. 
As for CH3OH products, Huang's group designed C3N4-anchored Cu SA (12 wt%) with regulated coordination structures of Cu–N4 and Cu–N3, which possess a high activity and selectivity for CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH under a low temperature of 70–150 °C. The coordination structure of Cu SA is easily operated by tuning the factors for treatment. Based on the study of mechanism, the results indicate that the reaction routes are markedly associated with the Cu SA coordination structure. In particular, Cu–N4 SACs display a CH3OH yield of 4.2 mmol g−1 h−1 with selectivity up to 95.5% at 150 °C, which is 3.2-fold greater than that of commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3. In addition, the formate route was identified to generate CH3OH over Cu–N4 SAC and generate CO over Cu–N3 SAC via the RWGS route.356 Analogously, Cu/ZrO2 SACs with Cu–O3 active sites are merely responsible for CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH with a high selectivity of 100% at 180 °C. The Cu SACs can enable the dissociation of H2 easily though the assistance of neighboring O atoms and combine with activated CO2 to form HCOO*, an important intermediate during CH3OH formation. In addition, the HCOO* route is also the only way for CO2 hydrogenation over isolated Cu1–O3 units. For comparison, small Cu clusters and/or Cu NPs with Cu–Cu structure are responsible for the generation of CO byproduct via the RWGS pathway, while large Cu NPs merely activate CO2 molecule under low temperatures. Most importantly, the geometry configuration and excellent activity displayed in Cu SACs offer an in-depth comprehension of Cu-catalyzed CO2 transformation and extend the horizon of Cu SACs in thermocatalytic CO2 conversion.357
Li et al. explored the synergetic effect of adjoining Pt monomers over MoS2, which dramatically boosted the catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation and also decreased the activation energy comparative to the isolated monomers. Adjoining Pt monomers were obtained on raising Pt loading as high as 7.5% while keeping the atomically dispersed Pt. Compared with the isolated monomers based on the study of the mechanism, adjoining Pt monomers together change the reaction energy barrier and experience various reaction routes. It is noteworthy that isolated Pt monomers favor the transformation of CO2 toward CH3OH and further suppress the generation of HCOOH, while CO2 is converted to HCOOH and CH3OH for adjoining Pt monomers.358
Furthermore, Chen et al. prepared Pt SACs (Pt1@MIL) and Pt NPs (Ptn@MIL) for CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH. The results show a higher TOF of 117 h−1 with the CH3OH selectivity up to 90.3% though the HCOO* intermediate over Pt1@MIL, and Ptn@MIL displayed a lower TOF of 20.9 h−1 with the main product of CO selectivity as high as 57.5% though the COOH* intermediate. The distinctive reaction route on Pt1@MIL decreases the reaction activation energy for the boosted reactivity and is beneficial for the high selectivity of CH3OH.342
It is noteworthy that subnano Re clusters display a higher catalytic activity and selectivity than Re SACs for CO2 hydrogenation into CH3OH. The Re clusters/TiO2 demonstrates CH3OH selectivity of ∼82% with a CH3OH yield rate of 1.8 mmol mmolRe−1 h−1, while Re SACs/TiO2 displayed a lower yield rate of only 0.2 mmol mmolRe−1 h−1, with CO selectivity of 94%. Furthermore, the structure–activity relationship demonstrates that Re subnanometer size (oxidation state: 0–4) is greatly favorable for the generation of CH3OH.359


3.4.6 Thermocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation to C2H5OH. 
Recently, to achieve the highly selective hydrogenation of CO2 into C2H5OH, Ye et al. prepared Ir1–In2O3 SACs combined with two active centers by stabilizing Ir over In2O3 support for C2H5OH generation using a wet chemistry synthetic strategy (Fig. 22a–c), which obtains an outstanding TOF of 481 h−1 with a C2H5OH selectivity of above 99%. Apparently, high loading led to the generation of CH3OH (Fig. 22d and e). STEM-HAADF and EXAFS reveals that a lower Ir loading of 0.04 wt% over the surface of In2O3 with extensive defects generated isolated Ir SA structure rather than NPs. In addition, the Ir SA couples with the neighboring Ov-generating Lewis acid–base pair can enable CO2 activation to the CO* intermediate, which is favorable for the adsorption over the Ir SA, while CH3O* is mainly adsorbed over In2O3 surface, Thus facilitating the formation of C2H5OH by C–C coupling between Irδ+–CO* and CH3O*–Ov (Fig. 22f–i).344

Rh SA decorated over Ti-doped CeO2 (Rh1/CeTiOx) has demonstrated a high C2H5OH selectivity of about 99.1% with a record-breaking TOF of 493.1 h−1 and superior stability (Fig. 22j). The structure favors Rh atoms to generate shorter Rh–O bonds (Fig. 22k) and shows a stronger energy barrier for the accumulate of Rh SAS. Consequently, Rh1/CeTiOx SACs display extremely high structural stability compared with Rh1/TiO2 and Rh1/CeO2 because of the higher bonding between the Rh single-atom sites and O atoms (Fig. 22l and m). The cooperative effects of Ti-doped and Rh SA lead to an outstanding performance by initially boosting Ov generation to form Ov–Rh Lewis-acid–base pairs, which improve the adsorption and activation of CO2; CHxOH* and COOH* were dissociated to CHx* and CO* and then generated C2H5OH via C–C coupling (Fig. 22n and o). Besides, the strong Rh–O bond originated from the Ti-doped form is evidently associated with the superior stability.360
Pd SA stabilized over the Fe3O4 surface is quite active for the conversion of CO2 to C2H5OH with a selectivity of 97.5% and activity as high as 413 mmolEtOH gPd−1 h−1 under 300 °C and even atmospheric pressure. However, Pd SA will be sintered and lead to deactivation when the temperature is higher than 350 °C, indicating a CO-favored activity as clusters and NPs. Raising the pressure also reduced the selectivity of C2H5OH and generated more CH3OH, C3H7OH, also including CO. As a reference, Pd/Al2O3 SACs was also synthesized using the same strategy with CO as the primary product for CO2 hydrogenation.345
Bifunctional SACs also have been reported and built for regulated C–C coupling by decorating Rh atom over the specific (101) crystal face of the 1D β-Mo2C nanowire for CO2 hydrogenation to C2H5OH. The synergistic effects between Mo2C and the Rh active centers are responsible for boosting the C2H5OH selectivity of 44.6%. By increasing the loading of Rh, the electronic state of the metal and support were altered, causing unmatched kinetics between CO2 hydrogenation and the C–C coupling, resulting in a lower C2H5OH selectivity. Noteworthily, the equilibrium between CO2 hydrogenation and C–C coupling was renewed by adding K to regulate the catalytic activity of β-Mo2C. Based on the optimum condition, the K/Rh/β-Mo2C catalyst provides superior C2H5OH selectivity up to 72.1% with the C2H5OH yield as high as 33.7 μmol g−1 h−1 at 150 °C.361
In general, SACs have exhibited a high catalytic ability for modulating the reaction routes toward CO2 hydrogenation. Under atmospheric pressure, most SACs were predominantly implemented via the RWGS process to generate CO, while the corresponding NPs were more favored via methanation to form CH4. Nevertheless, there are also special circumstances due to the differences in the inherent metal characteristics and temperature correlation. When the reaction of CO2 hydrogenation was manipulated under high pressure, SACs offer novel chances for synthesizing more valuable chemicals, such as CH3OH, HCOOH, and C2H5OH with higher productivity.

3.5 Combination mode of electro-, photo-, and thermocatalysis for CO2 conversion over SACs
The electro-, photo-, and thermocatalytic technologies have their own advantages and disadvantages. Combining two or three of these catalytic technologies for CO2 conversion, the intrinsic activity and reaction route of the catalyst may change to some extent. Most importantly, combining the advantages of each strategies can further enhance the catalytic efficiency. In particular, the photo-electrocatalytic system and photo-thermocatalytic system have been investigated for CO2 transformation over SACs. Table 5 summarizes the typical results over SACs during CO2 conversion.

3.5.1 Photo-electrocatalytic system for CO2 conversion over SACs. 
As for the photo-electrocatalytic system, Wang's group successfully fabricated several photo-coupled electrocatalysts by imitating the structure of chlorophyll (Fig. 23a). The Au species are in the SA form, which are revealed by HAADF-STEM and XAFS (Fig. 23b–d). As expected, FECO as high as 94.2% at 0.9 V under dark conditions and FECO of 95.2% at 0.8 V at visible light were obtained. In addition, compared with a TOF of 37069 h−1 in the dark at −1.1 V, HNTM–Au–SA displays a positive shift of ∼130 mV under a similar TOF with visible light (Fig. 23e and f). Based on DFT, the synergistic mechanism also offered and indicated that every Au atom possesses two active sites, which can combine two CO2 molecules and enhance the reduction of CO2 (Fig. 23g). Under visible light, the porphyrin ligand acts as the photoswitch to receive photons and induce outer electron transfer from the S0 state to the T1 state. Conversely, outer electrons can merely flow toward the LUMO under dark, thus requiring high overpotential (Fig. 23h–j). Consequently, the utilization of the photo-electrocatalytic system that combines light sensitivity with electrocatalytic activity offers a way to facilitate CO2 activation with a low overpotential.362

Cu, Co, and Fe single sites stabilized on 2D MOF nanosheets with well-organized and visualized mesoporous frameworks were synthesized with excellent CO2 reduction characteristics under visible light. As expected, compared with the results under dark, MOF-NS-Co receives an FECO up to 98.7% with 100 mV positive shift at −0.6 V for CO2-to-CO transformation under visible light. The CO yield rate is raised to 640.3 mmol g−1 h−1 at −1.1 V. It is noteworthy that a superior TOF of up to 11762 h−1 was obtained at −1.0 V with Co loading of 0.13%. The catalytic kinetic studies reveal that a rapid electron shift toward CO2 to generate *COO− could be promoted with supplemental light field, demonstrating that porphyrin can serve as a photoswitch to regulate the electron transfer route toward the active sites.363 Similarly, in a photocoupled electrocatalytic CO2 reduction system, CoN4-CB SACs provided an average FECO as high as 92.1% with jCO up to 98.3 mA cm−2 and solar-to-CO transformation efficiency up to ∼4.9%. By contrast, the jCO was just 21.2 mA cm−2 at −0.55 V without the assistance of solar light. This study offers a highly efficient M–N–C electrocatalyst and further accelerates the advancement of industrial application in solar-driven CO2 conversion system.237


3.5.2 Photo-thermocatalytic system for CO2 conversion over SACs. 
Because the introduction of the optional light absorbers enable to absorb the entire solar spectrum and produce few thermal radiation, Li et al. designed a photo-thermocatalytic transformation system, which can increase the temperature of catalysts up to 288 °C at one sun and favorably promote weak photocoupled thermocatalytic CO2 methanation (Fig. 24a). In addition, amorphous Y2O3 nanosheets-supported Ni SA with a loading of 3.9 wt% were synthesized (Fig. 24b and c). SA Ni/Y2O3 indicates a low-level starting temperature at 180 °C with a selectivity of up to ∼100% with CO2 conversion of ∼87% at 240 °C (Fig. 24d and e). Most importantly, the sunlight-driven photo-thermocatalytic CO2 methanation of SA Ni/Y2O3 displays 90% transformation and 100% CH4 selectivity when assisted via an optional light absorber (Fig. 24f). Furthermore, 80% CO2 conversion and CH4 yield rate as high as 80% and 7.5 L m−2 h−1, respectively, were achieved over SA Ni/Y2O3 under ambient daytime sunlight.364

Jia's group fabricated Ru-modified CdS nanorods (NRs) via a simple deposition-precipitation strategy, which indicates superior CH4 selectivity during the photothermocatalytic CO2 reaction with UV-vis-IR light irradiation. The addition of Ru SA onto CdS substantially enhances the CO2 adsorption level of the catalyst and further accelerates the separation of photogenerated electrons stemming from the conduction band of CdS, which is responsible for the transformation of CO2 to CH4. As shown in Fig. 24g and h, under UV-vis-IR light irradiation, the bare CdS displays a CO selectivity of 97.2% with a surface temperature of 237 °C, while CH4 selectivity as high as 97.6% with a CH4 yield of ∼8 μmol g−1 over 0.86%Ru/CdS is obtained at 275 °C. Noteworthily, the surface temperature is dropped to 110 °C just by IR light; the catalytic activity of CO2 conversion is not detected. Low-lying light irradiation of UV-vis-IR results in a low surface temperature of 229 °C, which exhibits an inferior catalytic performance of CH4. The thermal effect simultaneously introduced via light possesses a positive impact on photo-thermocatalysis, which can significantly boost the CH4 yield without turning the selectivity.354 Eventually, the possible pathways of photo-thermocatalytic CO2 reduction into CO and CH4 over the Ru/CdS catalyst was proposed (Fig. 24i).365
Overall, the photocoupled electrocatalytic or thermocatalytic system can tremendously improve the catalytic efficiency and act as a platform for directly applying solar energy to transform CO2 to valuable chemicals. Therefore, it is promising to design the catalyst by integrating the characteristics of electro-, photo-, and thermocatalytic method for achieving large-scale practical application. However, there are limited literature reports in terms of SACs and the products mainly focused on CO, CH4, and HCOOH (Table 5).

3.5 Challenges
As for the application of SACs for CO2 utilization into valuable fuels/chemicals, in spite of some remarkable progress that has been accomplished, it is still not enough to meet the needs of environmental and industrial-scale implementation. Technical challenges such as insufficient essential understanding, low catalytic efficiency, unsatisfactory target selectivity, as well as long-term stability have been extensively explored. Several significant challenges in the following aspects are: (a) from the viewpoint of thermodynamics and kinetics, CO2 molecules are relatively stable due to the activation of CO bonds involving great energy input of electricity, photon, and heat, which results in an inefficient CO2 conversion. In spite of significant studies for the reaction mechanisms of CO2 transformation having been widely discussed via experimental and theoretical calculations, the detailed processes for CO2 transformation into valuable chemicals are still unclear and further works are necessary. (b) The catalytic efficiency of CO2 transformation technologies is still not sufficient for real applications. In particular, the catalytic efficiency of some photocatalytic or photocoupled electrocatalytic/thermocatalytic conversion of CO2 are significantly lower than in natural photosynthesis. In addition, the overpotential for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is understandably too high to maintain the catalytic activity of SACs, leading to a limited efficiency of CO2 transformation toward valuable products. (c) Except for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction under high temperatures, relatively low product selectivity is still facing various difficulties for CO2 transformation via aqueous or non-aqueous pathways under low temperatures. Besides, byproducts are unavoidably formed and need further separation and purification. Although the product selectivity of CO, CH4, CH3OH, and HCOOH is easily raised, the C2+ hydrocarbons are relatively low and several difficulties exist, which seriously restrains the long-term stability and comprehensive catalytic performance. (d) The relationship between reactivity and stability of CO2 transformation have not been sufficiently revealed. For instance, a self-evident problem is the reduction of catalytic activity over the electrode under low temperatures, which may originate from poisoning or preventing the exposure of metal active sites. At present, the development of catalytic materials and basic studies has been carried out to cope with the stability problems. Nevertheless, the studies for this topic such as the characteristics of material behavior, understanding the reaction mechanisms, and the design of novel applicable materials are also insufficient and urgently to be further explored. (e) There are still limited for large-scale, long-life yield such as poor efficiency, expensiveness, and high energy consumption existing in CO2 transformation technologies. In spite of the countless efforts that have been undertaken to optimize the catalytic systems based on SACs, the improvements of these conversion strategies are still not enough for practical applications. In particular, the catalytic processes to synthesize versatile valuable chemicals such as HCOOH, CH3OCH3, C2H4, and C2H5OH are unprofitable, which tremendously hinder commercial and industrial development.
In short, SACs have demonstrated a great potential in CO2 conversion and brought about growing attention; however, the associated studies are still at the laboratory scale.
4. Conclusion and perspectives
The nearly 100% atomic efficiency, unique electronic characteristics, and abundant active sites make SACs a new promising catalytic material at present for transforming CO2 into various valuable chemicals. Herein, we emphasize the general principles of SAC design and the recent development of SACs for electro-, photo-, and thermocatalytic conversion of CO2, especially focusing on performance challenges and methods to obtain superior reactivity, product selectivity, and long-term stability. Although outstanding achievements have been achieved at present, there are still many challenges to be conquered.
CO2 conversion over SACs have shown great promise, and inspiring achievements have been published for versatile SACs concerning the highly efficient transformation of CO2 into valuable C1 (CO, CH4, CH3OH, HCOOH, etc.) and C2+ products (CH3OCH3, C2H5OH, C2H4, etc.) over the past few years (Fig. 25). Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction has been abundantly investigated over versatile SACs, particularly for M–N–C SACs, owing to their high current density and superior stability. The main Fe-, Ni-, and Co-based M–N–C catalysts (Table 2) displayed relatively high FECO and current densities, while Cu-based SACs exhibited the potential capabilities for the reduction of CO2 into higher valuable chemicals via 4e− transfer (CH4 and CH3OH) and 12e− transfer (C2H4 and C2H5OH). Besides, the CO2RR properties of the M–N–C SACs is also intensely influenced via the local environments of the metal center. For the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, introducing SA enabled markedly promoted charge transfer of the photoelectrons to the carrier, thus facilitating charge separation and raising the energy of CO2 adsorption. During the thermocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 under atmospheric pressure, most of the SACs were predominantly implemented via the RWGS process to generate CO, while the corresponding NPs were more favored via methanation to form CH4. When the reaction of CO2 hydrogenation was manipulated under high pressure, SACs offer novel chances for synthesizing more valuable chemicals, such as CH3OH, HCOOH, and C2H5OH with higher productivity. The abovementioned studies indicate that SACs offer special chances to change the adsorption model and energies from their corresponding NPs, and the changed adsorptions ultimately result in different catalytic performances.
 Fig. 25  Increase in the number of publications over SACs for catalytic applications from 2014 to 2021, obtained from the Web of Science database via the keywords (“single-atom catalysts” and “electro-, photo- and thermocatalytic CO2 conversion”). 
Several universal strategies of constructing selective, active, and highly stable SACs for the transformation of CO2 mainly contain: (a) accurately regulating the coordination environment of atomically dispersed metal atoms and ameliorating the homogeneity of the local environment; (b) optimum coordination environment for a counterbalanced adsorption and activation of CO2 and H2 during corresponding catalytic reactions; (c) in-depth exploration of the catalytic mechanism, comprehensive understanding of the rate-limiting step, especially effective strategies to cut down the catalytic barrier of rate-limiting steps (e.g., coordination engineering, synergistic effect of metal sites, defect design, etc.); (d) to ameliorate the long-term stability, the appropriate metal–support interaction also should be further optimized; (e) suitable metal–support configuration for higher product selectivity; (f) reaction conditions (reaction time, temperature, pressure, etc.) of the reactants should be systematically optimized.
It is noteworthy that compared with transitional bulk catalysts, SACs demonstrate enormously high reactivity and superior selectivity, along with excellent long-term stability. Nevertheless, although great achievements have been achieved in this field so far, there are still several challenges to the anticipative utilization and future advancement of SACs that demand to be precisely investigated and resolved. In general, further improvement in the subsequent aspects is prospected to be significant for boosting further growth and the practical application of SACs for CO2 utilization. A simple schematic illustration is also presented in Fig. 26.
 Fig. 26  Schematic illustration of future advancements of SACs in CO2 conversion. 
(a) Regulating the microenvironment of SACs
Electronic characteristics and corresponding reaction features of the active metal are profoundly limited, or at least evidently affected, via the coordination environment and microstructure. Consequently, it is significant to control the active site of the local structure and coordination number but are tremendously hard for supported SACs. Some efforts have been made to regulate the electronic characteristics and coordination environment. Even though the potential results have been received, it is still limited to the laboratory stage and far from being overcome. Approaches for well-regulating the coordination number and atom need to be researched and enhanced. Enlightened by the achievement for heteroatom-doped carbon materials and several 2D materials-decorated SACs, the functional modification or heteroatom doping of supports perhaps maybe an up-and-coming pathway.
(b) In-depth exploring of the CO2 activation and conversion processes
The mechanisms of adsorption and activation of CO2 require to be further investigated via machine learning and theoretical modeling. Machine learning could be applied to swiftly interpret the structure–activity relation and reaction mechanism of SACs, settling a significant scientific basis for the quick and precise design of SACs for various CO2 conversion reactions. With the help of theoretical calculation, the basic reactions and transition states during CO2 transformation demand to be further defined; mainly, the rate-limiting step and reaction routes are required to be regulated to surmount the reaction barriers. For instance, the catalytic mechanisms for CO2 conversion and the relationship to the type of active sites and its structure changes need to be comprehensively clarified to guide novel material advancement. To alleviate SACs or electrode material destruction, further basic understandings of reaction process and decomposition mechanisms during the conversion of CO2 is of great significant, which could be deeply revealed employing advanced technologies (VT-STM, XCT, SIMS, LEIS, in situ FTIR spectra, and XAS). For example, SIMS can be operated to exhibit the elemental 3D dispersion in the 3D model with fast O-incorporation routes and segregation of the electrode/electrolyte interface areas to understand the reactions for decomposition and lead to novel designs of materials. In addition, to better regulate the reactions for CO2 transformation kinetically, simulation technologies such as first-principles and DFT are required for the accurate calculation of energy barriers.
Moreover, in the practical catalytic process, the microenvironment of SACs will undergo a dynamic cycle and in situ generation of massive intermediates, while active sites also experience the evolution of the dynamic structure. Consequently, the integrated use of in situ/operando means linked with DFT studies is extremely important to explore the dynamic structure of SACs. Besides, with the help of artificial intelligence, the high-throughput sieving of the dynamic structures for SACs turns out to be easier, which will further boost the comprehensive elucidation of dynamic structure alteration.
(c) Development of advanced characterizations of SACs
Advanced characterization methods need to be further upgraded to deeply explore the coordination environment of SACs. The HAADF-STEM image, FTIR spectra, and XAS spectra are the most universally employed techniques for structure detection in SACs. HAADF-STEM images can be used for direct identification from the atomic level. But it is quite hard to distinguish SA only from the images when the analogous atomic number of metal SA is near the carrier. EXAFS and XANES combined enable to reveal the geometric configuration and understand the electronic structure of SACs. However, intrinsic disadvantages in the technique also exist. The analogous atomic number and adjacent bond distance exist in coordinated atoms (e.g., Fe–N and Fe–O bond). In this respect, it is difficult to explore the spatial and a long scattering distance structure as well as the low metal loading catalysts. Facing the above problems, high resolution EELS seems to be a feasible approach to overcome the dilemma. In addition, operando or in situ characterization and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) can be adopted to explore the dynamic structural change and reveal the intrinsic mechanism of active species over SACs during CO2 conversion.
(d) Optimized long-term stability for scale-up use
It is extremely significant to appraise their stability if the SACs are to be employed in industrial application. The intrinsic activity merit of the single atom is quite useful in the industrial catalytic system. However, the major challenge being faced at present is the poor stability, particularly when using reducing atmosphere and high temperature under practical industrial conditions. The elapsed time of catalyst stability under the industrial condition commonly takes several months or even years, which is longer than that at the laboratory scale. Consequently, how to maintain the intrinsic structure for the active sites and prevent agglomeration, migration, or loss of the active metal atoms during the practical reaction process are significant interfering factors during the follow-up advancement of the highly efficient and stable SACs. The researchers must pay more attention to seek ingenious preparation methods to design SACs with long-period thermodynamic stability. In addition, we also need to balance the reactivity and stability of SACs due to the saturated metal atom coordination that could develop the stability though unavoidably at the cost of the inherent reactivity of SACs. Therefore, if this difficulty is favorably overcome, SACs will turn into a competitive candidate for the scale-up conversion of CO2 in industrial applications.
(e) Exploring the approaches from SACs to multi-atomic catalysts
The nearly 100% atom utilization and special electronic structure for SACs have attracted widespread concern during the energy and catalysis. At present, dual/multi-atomic catalysts have also displayed superior catalytic properties in energy conversion and catalysis stem from the synergism with adjustable metal atoms. Compared with SACs, the adjustable metal atoms of multi-atomic catalysts can also work together and have certain a synergism for improving the reaction route and facilitating catalytic transformation in active centers and intermediates. Consequently, dual/multi-atom site catalysts display outstanding activity, ultrahigh selectivity, and longer running stability than the SACs. This may help to destroy the inherent linear correlation during the intermediate objects and process energy barriers, which can further boost the catalytic reactivity.
(f) Industrial scale-up and controllable synthesis of SACs
In light of the significant quantities of CO2 conversion that need harsh manipulation circumstance, the advancement of industrial-scale synthetic approaches that afford the high modification amount and stable SACs at affordable price are indispensable. Even though several methods have been presented, these means depend on strong stabilizing sites over the special carriers and then to some degree put up with the dilemma of universal practicality. Conventional immobilization strategies for the preparation of a series of wide-ranging SACs are urgently demanded. A feasible way is to study from approaches to fabricate relatively stable colloidal NPs, such as steric hindrance and electrostatic forces, which have been extensively explored and even deeply characterized over several decades. On the other hand, although more than 80% heterogeneous catalysts were synthesized though impregnation or precipitation, it is perhaps not applicable for all kinds of SACs preparation because of low contents are required to maintain the isolated single atom. Currently, simple shockwave strategies were upgraded to fabricate the heat-stable SACs. Solid-state preparations such as this way and other less traditional approaches probably discover some distinctive advantages for designing SACs in our future.
(g) Clean energy enables SACs to realize CO2 utilization
Renewable clean energy such as wind, nuclear, tide, solar, and geothermal energy are introduced to convert CO2 into value-added fuels/chemicals, and CO2 utilization and energy shortage problems can be alleviated in pace while offering better economic feasibility. For example, the transformation of CO2 to valuable products (e.g., CH4, HCOOH, CH3OH, and C2H4) though artificial photosynthesis could be implemented employing solar energy in scale-up. In addition, the co-electrolysis of CO2 and H2O could be conducted to synthesize useful products of CO/H2 employing solid oxide electrolysis cell working by electricity and heat stemming from surplus nuclear energy. Despite efforts being paid to boost these advancements, broader and extensible applications still in their early stages with integrated technologies concerning CO2 transformation systems and other renewable energy serve a significant role. Specialists in the sector of materials, heterogeneous catalysis, chemistry, as well as renewable energy can interact together to well-design the architecture of SACs to further satisfy practical application factors and reactor requirements, which is significant to improve energy utilization.

Broader context
Single-atom catalysis (SACs) provides an excellent platform to understand the active centers, explore the underlying catalytic mechanism, and reveal the structure–performance relationships, and have thus drawn ever-increasing attention for CO2 conversion and utilization. Massive study efforts have been devoted to introduce SACs and their advances have been widely reviewed. However, compared with traditional metal nanoparticle-based catalysts, SACs are still in their infancy in the field of electrochemical reduction, photocatalytic reduction, and thermochemical conversion of CO2, but they have aroused substantial concern in recent years, thus illuminating their prospect in practical applications. Hence, a timely and comprehensive introduction to advanced SACs and its recent advances in converting CO2 toward various valuable hydrocarbons (CO, CH4, CH3OH, HCOOH, and C2+ products) are of great significance for the development of SACs. Herein, detailed introductions and summaries were classified into three categories based on the CO2 transformation technologies, and their corresponding versatile products have also been systematically summarized and discussed. In addition, the design principles, practical applications, as well as perspective insights of SACs in CO2 conversion are also emphasized. We believe that this review will provide some new insights into the fields of carbon resource storage and conversion.
