    , Accepted 13th November 2020First published on 13th November 2020AbstractAmong the diverse graphitic carbon nitride (CN) nanostructures, CN nanotubes (CNNTs) are currently attracting increasing interest due to the appealing properties of CN and the geometric advantages of one-dimensional (1D) nanotubes. CN is a metal-free photocatalyst and has the advantages of exceptional electronic band structure, rich nitrogen content, and high physicochemical stability. Nanotubes have a unique 1D hollow nanostructure, and they provide large surface area, high aspect ratio, electron mobility along the axial direction, and quantum confinement effects. Therefore, CNNTs and CNNT-based materials have been extensively explored in many energy- and environment-related fields. In this review, the functional merits of CNNTs and recent progress in the precursor-based synthesis of CNNTs are discussed. Besides, the corresponding applications of CNNT-based nanomaterials are summarized, such as photocatalytic H2 production, pollutant degradation, and CO2 reduction. Moreover, the modification strategies of CNNTs using elemental doping, texture tailoring, and heterojunction engineering are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the future challenges and opportunities of CNNT-based nanostructures are proposed. With the rapid development of materials science and technology, more efforts need to be devoted toward promoting the advanced functionalities and promising applications of CNNT-based materials.
1. Introduction
Ever since the discovery of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by Iijima in 1991,1 new forms based on nanoscale have triggered tremendous research efforts in solid-state physics, chemistry, and materials science because of their potential applications. Nanotubes have unique nanostructures with novel mechanical and electronic properties, as well as improved heat conductivity; further, these characteristics depend on the geometry and defects of the tubes.2,3 Although carbon is still the main explored nanotube material in microelectronic technology, numerous works have been carried out to prepare nanotubes composed of other materials, and such nanotubes exhibit fascinating features, too. Among the reported transition metal oxides of tubular nanostructures, TiO2 nanotubes particularly prepared in electrochemical anodic oxidation are the most studied due to their high control of the physicochemical behavior.4–7 Nevertheless, the large bandgap (i.e., low solar-light absorption) of TiO2 nanotubes is their intrinsic bottleneck toward satisfying the requirements of practical applications. In the search for cheap and wide-spectrum-responsive nanomaterials, graphitic carbon nitride nanotubes (CNNTs, “g-C3N4 NTs,” or “heptazine-based CNNTs”) have attracted immediate interest, mainly due to the appealing properties of carbon nitride (CN) and its one-dimensional (1D) tubular structure.
CN, a fascinating material that is not new at all is presumably regarded as one of the oldest reported polymers.8 In particular, CN comprises C and N with some impurity of H, which are earth-abundant elements. The structure of this n-type semiconductor with the heptazine ring is similar to that of graphene, but with C substituted by N atoms forming sp2-hybridized π-conjugated polymeric systems. However, the stacking distance between the layers in CN is slightly higher and the interplanar interaction is somehow stronger than that of crystalline graphite.9,10 Wang et al. proposed this polymer in 2009 essentially as a metal-free and visible-light-responsive photocatalyst for water splitting.11 Since then, this material has been explored for various applications, such as the production of green and renewable energy carriers, reduction of CO2, fine chemical synthesis, and environmental pollutant degradation.12–16 Currently, CN can be recognized as a second-generation photocatalyst because of its low cost, tunable bandgap, suitable energy-band position, and high stability under harsh chemical conditions. In addition, because of its polymeric nature in terms of controllable surface chemistry via surface modification and flexible nanostructure, CN can also serve as a host matrix to some inorganic nanoparticles (NPs).17,18 For multipurpose applications, CN with nanoparticulated forms (by diminishing dimensions to the nanoscale) has been widely studied in order to increase the specific surface area for achieving a high overall efficiency. The nanostructures of CN can be designed and synthesized from 0D to 3D such as nanotubes, nanosheets, quantum dots, and nanospheres. Among these nanostructures, 1D CN nanostructures have aroused more attention due to their large specific surface area, high aspect ratio, and excellent ionic or electronic charge migration along the axial direction.
1D CN nanostructures can have a tube-, ribbon-, rod-, belt-, or fiber-shaped structure;19–23 in particular, hollow tubes may allow for much higher control of the physicochemical behavior. The structures of CNNTs resemble those of tiny straws. For CNNT structures, not only the surface area drastically increases but also the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties may considerably change because of quantum confinement, oriented charge migration, and strong contribution from surface reconstruction.24,25 These characteristics also significantly enhance the interactions between the material and surrounding reactants, thereby bringing a more effective system or novel reaction pathways in the channel. As such, these unique properties related to the structure, morphology, functionality, ease of modification, and suitability in hybrid nanocomposites benefit their potential applications.26–29 At present, many efforts have been devoted in CNNT synthesis toward uniform morphology, extraordinary performances, and facile operation process. However, some intrinsic drawbacks such as narrowed visible-light absorption and relatively high charge carrier recombination rate still limit the wide applications of CNNTs in some fields. Therefore, numerous modification strategies such as heterojunction engineering, elemental doping, and texture tailoring have been attempted to overcome these shortcomings. Fig. 1 shows the fabrication methods of CNNTs from various precursors, corresponding nanostructure design, and applications.

To date, there have been many inspiring review articles on CN such as 0D CN quantum dots,30 2D CN nanosheets,31–33 CN with various dimensionalities,34 noble-metal-free CN-based nanocomposites,18,35,36 graphene/CN nanohybrids,37 together with more reviews focusing on the preparation methods, characteristic advantages, and promising applications of CN.29,38–44 Considering the merits of the 1D tubular structure and the advantages of CN materials, a thorough review on the current advances of CNNTs is necessary to promote their great potential in future scientific studies and practical applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no such review article in the peer-reviewed literature. Therefore, our objective is to provide a comprehensive review in this field to shed light on the recent advances and progresses in CNNT-based nanocomposites. In particular, in this review, we will first introduce the beneficial features of bare CNNTs. Following the synthesis pathways and the specific morphologies and their relationships, we will detail the current applications of CNNT-based nanocomposites particularly in photocatalytic H2 evolution, degradation of pollutants, CO2 reduction, and so on. Besides, we will also discuss the modification strategies of CNNTs toward enhanced performances such as increased light absorption, enlarged surface area, and promoted charge separation. Finally, we will analyze the major opportunities and challenges and provide some perspectives for the future exploration of CNNT-based nanocomposites.
2. Beneficial characteristics of CNNTs
CNNTs outperform their counterparts in various applications. The main reason is that some of the intrinsic properties of CN provide the basis for exceptional features, and the 1D nanotubular structure endows fascinating characteristics such as increased fascinating light-capture ability, larger surface area, quantum confinement effect, and promoted electron–hole transfer along the axial direction. In this section, the characteristics of CNNTs—in terms of structural, optical, and physicochemical properties—will be detailed by means of theoretical studies and experimental observations; however, the reader is referred to many excellent reviews for additional details on the properties of CN material by groups such as Antonietti,45,46 Qiao,47 Yu,48 and Wang.49
2.1 Crystal structures and stability
Generally, there are seven phases of CN,50 namely, α-CN, β-CN, cubic CN, etc. In this review, CN is mainly classified into two categories according to their subunits: heptazine (tri-s-triazine or melon)- and triazine-based CN (Fig. 2a); in this review, CN refers to heptazine-based CN, unless specified otherwise. CN is relatively recognized as a more stable and energetically favorable allotrope in the ambient environment, e.g., it is thermally stable up to ∼600 °C in air, because of the aromatic C–N heterocycles.37,51 CN consists of carbon (graphitic carbon) and nitrogen (graphitic and pyridinic nitrogen), and single C–N links between the heptazine units serve to accommodate electronic repulsions. Carbon, nitrogen, and some impure hydrogen elements are earth abundant, implying that CN can be fabricated at a low cost. Owing to the strong van der Waals interactions, CN is chemically stable in conventional solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide, diethyl ether, alcohols, water, toluene, and tetrahydrofuran.48 Further, the polymeric nature of CN assures surface chemistry control and sufficient flexibility of the structure, which can serve as a host matrix of outstanding compatibility to various inorganic NPs.

Fig. 2b shows the framework of CNNTs formed by rolling up a triazine-based CN monolayer along one direction. Theoretically, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, single-walled and double-walled triazine-based CNNTs are more stable than the triazine-based single sheet of CN;54 further, the single-walled CNNTs have higher stability than monolayer and bulk CN.55 The better stabilities of these nanotubes should come from the rolled geometry for releasing the repulsion from the lone pair of electrons.54,56 Besides, the experimental analysis of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns revealed that the (002) plane indexed to the interlayer stacking of the aromatic systems in CNNTs decreases as compared to that in bulk CN and CN nanosheets, whereas the in-plane structural packing motif remains unchanged (Fig. 2c). This implies that the tubular structure presents a further decreased interlayer distance between two adjacent unit layers, and therefore, a decreased interlayer distance provides larger energy.52 Therefore, both theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated better stabilities of CNNTs in contrast to their counterparts.
2.2 1D and hollow structure
Compared with bulk CN, a tubular CN nanostructure possesses the superiorities of both 1D and hollow structure; therefore, it holds great promise in the following aspects: (1) shorter radial length with decreased electron–hole-pair migration distance, (2) longer axial length with multiple reflections of incident light accompanied by enhanced light capture,26 (3) larger surface area resulting in more active sites and mass diffusion,57 and (4) directional transfer promoting the charge separation and transport without lateral migration.58 In general, CNNTs show superior properties in contrast to their counterparts with larger dimensions. CNNTs with well-controlled compositions, crystallinity, or dimensions represent a new class of intriguing systems for investigating the structure–property relationships.
2.3 Electron transport properties
The heptazine unit possesses a larger p-conjugated system than the triazine unit, which facilitates light harvesting and increases the mobility of photogenerated carriers. Unlike the monolayer, the charge mobility of CNNTs is improved with a decreased effective mass, leading to the higher activity of CNNTs.55 From the calculation results, the electric dipole transitions in CNNTs are only operated along the axial direction, not along the y and z directions.59 As shown in Fig. 3a, after the CNNTs are activated by visible light, the photoexcited electrons transfer along the longitudinal dimension, thereby facilitating the separation and migration of charge carriers. CNNTs also have a larger surface area than bulk CN and CN nanosheets, as demonstrated by the experimental results, and the broad pore size is smaller than that of the CN nanosheets.53 Evidently, the nanotube structure generates more charge carriers and facilitates access of the reactants to more active sites and product diffusion in the channel. In particular, the hollow tubular structure is favorable to minimize the recombination rate of the electrons and holes with a decreased migration distance.

2.4 Optical properties
Polymeric CN possesses a bandgap of ∼2.7 eV, with the conduction band (CB) formed by C 2p orbitals at approximately −1.3 eV (vs. NHE) and the valence band (VB) constituted by N 2p orbitals at approximately +1.4 eV (vs. NHE) (Fig. 3a), resulting in an onset of visible-light absorbance at approximately 450 nm.18 Both smaller and larger bandgaps for CNNTs compared with those of the bulk CN are observed because of the different chirality types of the CNNTs.56 For example, Zhu et al. found that the energy levels of CNNTs prepared via a facile condensation method are shifted, and the CB and VB potentials are located at 2.12 and −0.62 eV (vs. NHE), respectively (Fig. 3a).28,60 In this case, size confinement plays an indispensable role in determining the band positions once their diameters decrease below a critical value (the Bohr radius). In another study, the bandgap energy of CNNTs prepared from urea and melamine formaldehyde (MF) resin was decreased to 2.57 eV (vs. NHE) because of the promoted electronic structure,103 and the band positions are shown in Fig. 3a. Gracia et al. computed the optical properties of CNNTs and found that the bandgaps of the resultant hexagonal nanotubes are independent of the tube size and chirality.61 Additionally, the position of the terminal groups in CNNTs plays an important role in the nonlinear optical properties.59 Chai et al. built armchair and zigzag CNNTs based on triazine units, and they found that the calculated total energy of zigzag-triazine-based CNNTs is larger than that of the armchair structure, but these materials are direct bandgap semiconductors.62
Generally, bulk CN exhibits strong blue photoluminescence (PL) at room temperature and the luminescence is observed over a wide range (410–600 nm) with a peak centered at about 460 nm (Fig. 3b). A blue-shift in the peak wavelength is observed in the spectra of the CNNTs, which can be attributed to the transition between the VB with a lone pair and the π* CB.26 The inset of Fig. 3c shows a bright blue color emitted by the CNNT samples under the illumination of a 325 nm laser, suggesting that the nanotubes can be applied as a good blue light-emitting nanomaterial.52 In contrast to the bulk CN (3.08 ns), the CNNTs present a shorter fluorescence lifetime (1.52 ns) of the electron–hole pairs, which pass via a nonradiative pathway, demonstrating the efficient charge separation and transfer in the CNNTs (Fig. 3c).26 Due to the improved optical properties of the CNNTs compared with bulk CN, CNNTs show wide applications and superior performance. For instance, CNNTs can be used in solar-energy conversion systems, such as photoelectrochemical cells, owing to the suitable electronic band structure. From the photocurrent measurement in the case of bulk CN, CN nanosheet and CNNTs with the irradiation of visible light (λ > 420 nm), CNNTs present a higher photocurrent response than bulk CN and CN nanosheets.53
3. Synthesis of CNNTs
Since the first report on the synthesis of CNNTs, a growing number of studies on the preparation of CNNTs with various geometries have been developed. The tube morphologies (length, diameter, and uniformity) and composition of CNNTs are strongly determined by the selection of precursors, synthesis techniques, and reaction parameters. From the roadmap of the evolution of fabricating CNNTs (shown in Fig. 4), it can be deduced that considerable efforts have been devoted throughout the years to explore and develop CNNTs toward easy and green operating processes. So far, many researchers have used single precursors including C2H2 and N2 gases,63–66 cyanuric chloride,67–69 and melamine23,52,70–75 to synthesize CNNTs. Other precursors such as Ni phthalocyanine76 and urea77 have also been used as a single raw material. CNNTs prepared from mixed precursors exhibit diverse morphologies. Moreover, the synthesis strategies for CNNTs have been extensively explored, including template-based and template-free methods. The template-free methods mainly involve post-synthesis treatment, chemical assembly, and self-assembly. Table 1 provides a summary of the morphologies of CNNTs developed from various types of starting precursors and different synthesis methods. In this section, the fabrication approaches according to the frequently used precursors will be introduced in detail, with a focus on the relationship between the methods and tube geometries. Furthermore, the mechanisms of the synthesis methods and their advantages and limitations will be compared and comprehensively discussed.

3.1 Gases as the precursor
When using gas mixtures as the starting materials, the hard-template method and magnetron sputtering are the two main techniques to obtain CNNTs. In the hard-template method, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) treatment of gas mixtures (e.g., C2H2–N2 gases or N2–H2–CH4 gas mixture) enables the formation of CN coating layers onto the hard template followed by the removal of the template. Shih's group used this strategy to prepare CNNTs, which could be the first report on CNNTs.63 In their study, an alumina membrane was used as the template and a gas mixture of C2H2 and N2 was used as the precursor. A bundle of straight CNNTs with a diameter of 250 nm and a length of several micrometers was obtained (Fig. 5d and e) after the template was partially removed by an acidic solution. Fig. 5a and b show the CNNT formation process. Under electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) conditions, a huge amount of the dissociation of C2H2 and N2 gases provided a relatively high plasma density at a lower temperature. In the presence of a negative dc bias, the flow of neutral dipoles and positive ions through the template was promoted toward the graphite substrate. The ion fluxes were guided via the straight channels of the alumina template for the nucleation and growth of CN. When the CNNTs grew thicker and deeper, a continuous dark layer was formed, which ultimately closed the channel entries. Thus, the flow conditions of the ion fluxes controlled the tube length and wall thickness of the CNNTs. It should be noted that the dc bias plays a key role in the formation of the CNNTs. In the absence of a dc bias, synthesis only occurs on the top surface of the template instead of the inner channels, thereby failing to achieve the 1D morphology (Fig. 5c).64

Another method of CNNT synthesis from gases is the magnetron sputtering technology.78 Suenaga and co-workers grew straight CNNTs on sodium chloride substrates by magnetron sputtering of a graphite target in mixed Ar and N2 gases (Fig. 5h). Although the as-synthesized CNNTs are well aligned, their sizes are not uniform, with a diameter of 10–50 nm and a length of approximately 50 nm (Fig. 5f and g). Besides, the crystallinity and optical properties were unsatisfactory. The N/C atomic ratio in the produced nanomaterial was below the ideal composition of 4:3, and some oxygen impurities were detected. In contrast to the magnetron sputtering method, the hard-template technique combined with CVD usually produces well-arrayed CNNTs with a more uniform size and higher crystallinity. This can be explained by the fact that the CVD of the gases onto a hard template facilitates the formation of uniform CNNTs with good alignment. Nevertheless, CNNTs obtained from the hard-template method suffer from the damage or collapse of the tubular structure after removing the template and solvents. In addition, the complete removal of the template and other chemical residues might be challenging and time-consuming and can even affect the properties of the CNNTs. As a result, an appropriate hard template that can be easily removed and mild operating conditions for the gas-induced formation of CNNTs are required for future development.
3.2 Cyanuric chloride as the precursor
When cyanuric chloride is used as the primary starting material, the chemical assembly route is applied by solvothermal treatment with benzene/cyclohexane solvents. Guo et al. reported a simple benzene-thermal process including a solvothermal reaction of C3N3Cl3, NaN3, and benzene, followed by the addition of NaCl2 and N2 gas (Fig. 6a).67 The synthesized nanotubes exhibit inner diameters of 50–100 nm and a wall thickness of 20–50 nm; however, the end of the nanotubes are not open. Different from that, Cao et al. substituted benzene for cyclohexane as the solvents by solvothermal treatment under a pressure of 1.8 MPa.68,79,80 The obtained CNNTs possessed diameters ranging from 50 to 100 nm with lengths of several micrometers or even larger (Fig. 6b). The tested N/C atomic ratio for CNNTs is very close to 1:1. Interestingly, the CNNTs obtained by this method have open ends, indicating the importance of solvents on the pore connectivity. Again, the solvents used here are usually hazardous and not environmentally friendly; a low-cost, nontoxic solvent is needed for future studies.

3.3 Melamine as precursor
Melamine is one of the most utilized precursors to synthesize CNNTs, because the pyrolysis of melamine usually yields slightly defective, polymeric species. Similar to the gas precursor, the hard-template method is also applicable to melamine, as reported by Kai et al. In their case, melamine was used as a precursor and an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane was used as the hard template.88 A relatively greener self-assembly process can simplify the synthesis route. For example, Wang et al. reported a facile calcination process for obtaining melamine-derived CNNTs via the self-supported NH3 gas in the absence of additive assistance.52 Before the calcination process, melamine was packed to a moderate degree (Fig. 7a(I)). During the thermal condensation process, NH3 gas was released and went through moderately packed supramolecules to form slightly rolled CN sheets. Meanwhile, with the pyrolysis of the intermediate, these formed CN sheets further tended to roll into tube-like structures to minimize the total surface free energy (Fig. 7a(II)). As a consequence, CNNTs were successfully fabricated by rolling the CN sheets under the assistance of the flowing NH3 (Fig. 7a(III)). The as-synthesized CNNTs exhibit a tube-like morphology with an average diameter of about 80 nm, and they are well arranged in a compact, ordered array with some nanotubes even longer than 10 μm. Additionally, from the elemental analysis, the N/C atomic ratio is determined to be around 1.26, which is close to the CN stoichiometry. To avoid the generation of irregularly arranged surfaces, Zhu et al. improved this method by removing the floating part of the moderately compacted melamine.28

Another frequently used method to prepare CNNTs from melamine is a post-synthesis treatment, where two pathways can be classified. One is to transform melamine into bulk CN and then transform to CN nanosheets/nanorods via sonication or acid treatment, followed by the hydrothermal/solvothermal process or cool-water quenching treatment. The other is to treat melamine into a melamine–cyanuric acid (MCA) complex microrods/melamine-based nanoribbon, followed by a thermal annealing process. For example, inspired by the hydrothermal synthesis of TiO2 NTs, Luo et al. reported a one-step hydrothermal/solvothermal treatment strategy for CNNT synthesis.82–84 In their studies, bulk CN was exfoliated into CN nanosheets via ultrasonic crashing, followed by a hydrothermal/solvothermal treatment. The formation of CNNTs follows a rolling-up mechanism: during the thermal condensation process, the –NH2 groups within the CN nanosheets were substituted by –OH groups; after that, the CN nanosheets were curled and scrolled to the tubular nanostructures (Fig. 7b–d). It is believed that this architecture decreased the charge imbalance on account of the dangling or unsaturated bonds at the edges of the intermediate nanostructure. Nevertheless, the length and diameter of these CNNTs are not uniform, as evidenced by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. Therefore, the sizes of the nanotubes are determined by the curly CN nanosheet unit.
By using the same mechanism, a water-induced morphological transformation method was reported to synthesize CNNTs, which comprises four main steps: (1) calcining the melamine, (2) exfoliating the bulk CN, (3) heating the CN nanosheets, and (4) cool-water quenching the hot CN nanosheets.53 The cool water plays an important role in the crimping of the CN nanosheets because of the poor thermal conductivity during the sudden hot–cold process. In another study, Huang et al. designed a new technique by heating precursors after the recrystallization of the CN nanosheets from an H2SO4/methanol solution.81 After the bulk CN powders were dissolved in the H2SO4 solution, single-atomic-layer nanosheets were obtained. Subsequently, these nanosheets were rearranged into nanorod structures in a flower-like morphology during the recrystallization process. Finally, these nanorods were calcined to form nanotubes. The H2SO4/methanol solution can introduce abundant pores in the CNNTs, endowing the nanomaterial with faster mass transfer and improved reactant diffusion. The obtained CNNTs possess a large specific surface area of 117.7 m2 g−1 due to the hole structure and low defects. Additionally, the C/N atomic ratio was tested to be 0.68, which is approximately consistent with the CN stoichiometry. However, the sizes of the nanotubes are nonuniform and the lengths are about several micrometers.
Zhang et al. found that melamine could be first treated by a hydrothermal reaction to form MCA complex microrods (Fig. 8a). The MCA complex was a desirable precursor for CN synthesis with various morphologies. After thermal polycondensation, these microrods were transformed to CN microtubes with a diameter of 1–2 μm and length of several micrometers.87 In another study, Gao et al. reported a facile method for the development of triazine-based CNNTs by the post-treatment of melamine.23 Elemental analysis revealed that the triazine-based CNNTs possess a C/N atomic ratio of 3:4.82, close to the theoretical value of CN. Briefly, the synthesis process followed these four steps: (1) dissolving melamine in ethylene glycol, (2) adding a nitric acid aqueous solution, (3) washing the formed white precipitation, and (4) annealing the white precipitation to yield CNNTs. The formation mechanism (as shown in Fig. 8b) was based on the 1D fibrous self-assembly of the protonated melamine, which was a solvent-mediated process. For the post-synthesis method using melamine as the starting material, the sizes of the nanotubes were determined by intermediate units such as CN nanosheets and MCA nanorods; therefore, the dimensions of the generated CNNTs are usually uncontrollable.

3.4 Copolymerization of mixed precursors
Other than the polymerization/condensation of a single precursor, mixed ethylenediamine and CCl4,93,94 mixed cyanuric chloride, ferrocene and sodium azide,91 mixed urea and oxamide (OA),98 mixed urea and MF resin,103 mixed melamine and another chemical such as cyanuric acid,95,99,100,105 ethylene glycol,96 urea,104 TAP,97 and phosphorous acid101 have been used as the starting raw materials. In contrast to a single precursor, the utilization of more than one kind of precursor diversifies the tubular geometries of the obtained CNNTs, considering the different polycondensation features of each precursor.
Mixed ethylenediamine and CCl4 precursors were used to synthesize CNNTs, where AAO—a porous material with well-aligned vertical pore channels—is usually used as the template to induce the formation of a nanotube structure.93 As shown in Fig. 9a, by the polymerization and carbonization of the precursors inside the pore channels of AAO, an ordered array of CNNTs with a uniform size was obtained. The obtained CNNTs have an open end and the outer diameter is approximately 300 nm with a wall thickness of around 30 nm. The average length of the CNNTs is uniform (∼60 μm), which is close to the thickness of the AAO membrane, indicating that the size of the nanotubes can be easily tuned by the length of the pore channels in AAO. In another study, CNNTs were synthesized from the polycondensation of melamine and CCl4 precursors at 290 °C under a pressure of 4.5–5 MPa, and the resultant nanotubes possessed outer diameters in the range of 70–200 nm, inner diameters of 5–20 nm, and length of several micrometers with open ends (Fig. 9b).92

Mixed melamine and cyanuric acid precursors have also been used as mixed precursors. Compared with the complicated operation of the hard-template method described above, soft templating is a relatively simpler and more convenient technique. Currently, poly(ionic liquid)s and poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-PPG-PEG) soft templates have been utilized. Zhao and co-workers synthesized CN tubes by the thermal polymerization of MCA precursors with poly(ionic liquid)s, such as poly(1-butyl-3-vinyl imidazolium bromide) (PIL1) and poly(1-butyl-3-vinyl imidazolium bromide acrylamide) (PIL2), as the soft templates.99 Similar to the hydrothermal-assisted pyrolysis approach described in Section 3.2, only the poly(ionic liquid)s were added in this case before the hydrothermal process (Fig. 10a). Poly(ionic liquid)s behave as a soft modifier on the structure of the MCA supramolecular aggregates, leading to many pores on the MCA rods. In addition, the interactions between the precursor and poly(ionic liquid)s and the solubility of precursors also significantly influence the growth direction of hydrogen bonds and the final morphology of the aggregates. With an increase in the content of poly(ionic liquid)s, the texture changes from closed-ended tubes into open-ended tubes with many pores on the walls, and the tubes become more uniform with a smaller diameter. The prepared CN tubes have a moderately high surface area of 23 m2 g−1 than bare CN that does not use soft templates (3 m2 g−1). Further, this texture also promotes charge transfer along the longitudinal dimension, thereby efficiently improving the photogenerated electron–hole separation rate.

Precursors containing additives exhibit positive influences on the polycondensation process, enabling the modification of textural, structural, electronic, and optical properties of CNNTs. Melamine and urea/cyanuric acid precursors have been used to form MCA supramolecular structures via hydrogen bonding (Fig. 10b), and the CNNTs are generated followed by a thermal polymerization process.104 Melamine-and-urea-derived CNNTs (CN-MU) exhibit a length of ∼2–3 μm and a diameter of about 250 nm, whereas CNNTs prepared from melamine and cyanuric acid (CN-MCA) have a shorter length of 200–800 nm and a smaller diameter of 150 nm. This implies that the interaction between the melamine and urea precursors results in larger geometries of the generated tubes. The C/N atomic ratio in the CN-MU and CN-MCA samples determined from the elemental analysis were 0.68 and 0.69, respectively, which are very close to the CN stoichiometry. The CN-MU material presents a higher photocatalytic H2 production rate than CN-MCA, and both materials show higher rates than those samples prepared with a single precursor (melamine or cyanuric acid), suggesting the advantages of mixed precursors over a single kind of precursor in CNNT preparation.
It is interesting that triazine-based CNNTs with bamboolike morphology can be obtained through the reaction of cyanuric chloride, ferrocene, and sodium azide in a sealed, solvent-free system.91 As shown in Fig. 9c, the bamboolike CNNTs are up to several micrometers long with diameters of 50–100 nm, and a frequent and regular compartmentalized morphology is observed. The added sodium azide reacts with cyanuric chloride to produce an s-triazine ring, which provides the feasibility to achieve the bamboolike CN structure. In another recent study, OA—similar to urea in structure and reactivity—was added in the polycondensation of urea to tailor the structural and physicochemical properties of CN.98 OA and urea compounds interacted with each other via a hydrogen bond to form a crosslinked complex. Then, a unique CN with well-designed architecture was generated and facilitated by the fast evolution of CO2 and NH3 gases during the calcining process. The nanostructures present weakly ordered, hollow nanotubes with pores and a tube thickness of less than 10 nm (Fig. 10c). Minor changes in the C/N molecular ratio were observed from 0.71 (CN) to 0.77 (CN with an OA mass ratio of 0.1) after the modification of OA. More importantly, the OA-copolymerized material exhibited considerably improved visible-light absorption even up to 650 nm when the OA mass fraction was 0.1 compared with that of 450 nm for CN. This can probably be attributed to the n → π* electron transitions in the heptazine units instead of the π → π* electron transitions involved in the conjugated aromatic system (Fig. 10d). Furthermore, the addition of OA narrows the bandgap from 2.75 to 2.21 eV with a lower resistance of charge carrier transfer, as shown in Fig. 10e.
To sum up, various kinds of precursors have been used to synthesize CNNTs via different approaches. Generally, the synthesis strategies can be classified into template-based and template-free methods, and the former includes hard-templating and soft-templating protocols. On the other hand, template-free methods comprise post-synthesis treatment, self-assembly, and chemical assembly. These methods offer the advantage of easy operation process, but most of them fail in allowing control over the tubular structure. Nevertheless, template-based approaches can usually yield the desired tubular size and structure under precise control. Except for the influence of the precursors and the synthesis techniques on the morphologies, the preparation parameters play an indispensable role in modulating the morphologies and properties of CNNTs. As a case in point, Jin et al. first treated melamine via a hydrothermal reaction and then obtained the tubular structures via condensation.86 As the heating time increased from 12 to 24 h, the diameter of the nanotubes reduced from ∼108 to 80 nm; accordingly, the surface area was enlarged by nearly 28.1 m2 g−1. Therefore, the sizes of the nanotubes can be controlled by varying the duration of thermal treatment. Other synthesis parameters such as hydrothermal temperature and hydrothermal solvents affect the morphology and properties of the CNNTs, too.106 Overall, the selection of precursors, additives, synthesis conditions, and synthesis methods—to a large extent—determines the morphology and properties of the obtained CNNTs.
4. Applications of CNNT-based nanocomposites
The applications of CNNTs usually involve the exploitation of some unique features of CN such as electronic, mechanical, or optical properties, as well as significantly improved reaction rates, using the 1D structure (size effect, large surface area, or short diffusion path). However, CNNTs suffer from several intrinsic shortcomings such as low electrical conductivity, low visible-light response, and fast charge carrier recombination rate. In practice, in order to prepare highly efficient CNNT-based nanostructures, three important criteria should be satisfied: (i) accelerated charge migration and separation, (ii) improved solar-light harvesting, and (iii) high photochemical stability for prolonged reactions. The design of CNNT-based nanocomposites has become a feasible and appealing strategy to overcome the above issues, thereby improving the activities in many fields.27–29 In this section, we will discuss the current efforts on CNNT-based hybrid materials toward applications in photocatalytic H2 evolution, removal of pollutants, CO2 reduction, and other potential fields for the benefit of all readers.
4.1 Photocatalytic H2 evolution
Hydrogen energy is widely considered to be one of the most promising green fuels. As a better alternative to conventional energy sources, H2 can become a potential clean energy carrier once it can be produced from renewable and sustainable technology. In particular, H2 evolution by employing semiconductor and solar energy has proven to be an optional technique to resolve the global energy and environmental issues.107,108 Compared with overall water splitting, half-reaction-based H2 production is widely studied at the expense of a sacrificial reagent because the necessity to separate H2 from mixed gases is disadvantageous toward high H2 production efficiency. A pioneering work demonstrated the superior activities of CNNTs toward H2 production in contrast to that of bulk CN and CN nanosheets. Upon visible-light illumination, bare CNNTs produced 28.5 μmol h−1 of H2 with the addition of 3 wt% Pt during the photocatalytic process, and the rate was over 4 and 2 times greater than that of bulk CN and CN nanosheet, respectively.53 It is known that visible (400–800 nm) and infrared (>800 nm) light has much higher solar spectrum coverage than that of ultraviolet light (<400 nm) (∼53% and 43% vs. ∼4%, respectively). Therefore, in order to achieve high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, it is critical to rationally design and synthesize CNNT-based catalysts with effective visible- or infrared-light response. The main strategies to enhance the photocatalytic performance include elemental doping, texture tailoring, and heterojunction engineering. Table S1† summarizes various CNNT-based nanocomposites with improved photocatalytic H2 production over the past few years. The following section will critically exemplify multifarious types of CNNT-based nanocomposites in photocatalytic H2 evolution.

4.1.1 Elemental doping for enhanced H2 production. 
Elemental doping plays an essential role in tuning the bandgap structure, enhancing light absorption, generating more active sites, and inhibiting charge recombination. CN is intrinsically feasible to capture cations owing to the interactions between the negatively charged nitrogen atoms and the cations.109 Such an ability facilitates the engineering of metal ions into bare CNNTs. Based on first-principles calculations, tungsten- and titanium-doped CNNTs have shown ferromagnetic properties, depending on the coupling between the p electrons of N or C atoms and the d electrons of metals.110 CNNTs doped with 3 wt% NaCl by a template-free method afforded enhanced photocatalytic H2 performance.111 In another study, Gao et al. coordinated alkali metals into the C–N plane of CN for a nonuniform spatial charge distribution.112 Under visible-light irradiation, the amount of evolved H2 over the alkali-metal-inserted CNNTs reached 346 μmol h−1, which was 34.60 times that of the bare bulk CN (as reported by Wang et al.) in the presence of 10 vol% TEOA as a sacrificial reagent and 3 wt% Pt as a cocatalyst.11 By adding KCl, NaCl, and LiCl into the reaction mixture, the H2 generation rate was further increased to 502 μmol h−1, with a quantum yield of 21.20% at 420 nm. However, the H2 production activity decreased by ∼50% after four cycling tests, mainly resulting from the loss of K, Na, Li, and Cl ions from the nanocomposites.
Similarly, Zhang and co-workers prepared sodium-doped CNNTs (Nax-CNNTs, x = doping mass ratio of Na) using a two-step method.113 The Na0.1-CNNTs sample has a tubular structure in the microscale with a diameter in the range of 1–3 μm and a length of 10–40 μm. It is worthy to mention that the concentration of NaOH precursors could not significantly influence the size of the Na-intercalated CNNTs. The obtained nanocomposite was employed for the generation of H2 in the presence of 3 wt% Pt and 10 vol% TEOA. Na0.1-CNNTs showed an H2 evolution rate of 143 μmol h−1, which was about 11 times higher than that of the bulk CN (Fig. 11a); the sample was stable for 30 h and afforded an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 1.80% at 420 nm (Fig. 11d). Notably, the photocatalytic activity was enhanced with an increase in the Na content from 0 to 0.10 wt%; however, a lower H2 evolution was observed when the Na+ content was further increased to 0.15 wt%. Moreover, the influence of thermal polymerization temperature on the photocatalytic H2 yield was investigated, and the highest activity was achieved with the catalysts calcined at 600 °C (Fig. 11b). These results suggest that a suitable Na+ doping content and annealing temperature are crucial for optimizing the photocatalytic performance. In addition, Fig. 11c shows that Na doping afforded better activities in visible-light-induced H2 production than other alkali metal doping, such as Li and K.

The incorporation of elemental Cu into CNNTs was reported for the first time by Yan and co-workers via a selective cation replacement strategy with the eutectic salts as the template.114 The synthesis of the Cu-CNNT catalyst mainly involves three stages: the formation of the eutectic molten salts flux, the protonation process, and dehydrogenation process. The final prepared Cu-CNNTs have a mesoporous tubular appearance with a length of about 2–5 μm and a diameter of around 300 nm (Fig. 11e). The presence of Cu heteroatoms in Cu-doped CNNTs was confirmed by elemental mapping with well-resolved C, N, and Cu (Fig. 11f). Meanwhile, after the modification of Cu ions in bare CNNTs, the lifetime of the charge carriers was prolonged to 4.79 ns, in contrast to 2.61 ns for the bulk CN (Fig. 11g). Moreover, Cu doping narrowed the bandgap of CNNTs and also ameliorated the transfer, transport, and separation efficiency of the photoexcited electron–hole pairs. It can be further corroborated that Cu-CNNTs presented the highest photocurrent density than the other samples with respect to the transient photocurrent response under visible-light irradiation (Fig. 11h). Co-doped CNNTs prepared from organic–inorganic precursors have also exhibited good photocatalytic H2 production rates.115 Except for monometal doping, CNNTs codoped with Co–Ni116 and Au–Pd117 showed outstanding surface area and enhanced activities.
In addition to metal doping, nonmetal doping has also been employed in the framework of CNNTs. Based on theoretical calculations, C-doped single-walled CNNTs afforded tunable half-metallicity and metal-free magnetism.118,119 From the experimental analysis, carbon self-doped CNNTs exposed abundant defects and demonstrated improved photocatalytic H2 evolution.120 Many researchers have doped elemental P into the CNNT framework.121–123 For instance, Guo et al. fabricated a layered stacking nanoarchitecture of P-doped CNNTs by treating melamine under a phosphorous-acid-aided hydrothermal process with a pH of 1–3.121 The synthesized P-CNNTs exhibited hexagonal tubular morphology with a diameter of around 25 μm. The successful P doping was observed from the 31P NMR spectrum; the XPS spectrum revealed that P most likely substituted C in the triazine rings to form P–N bonds. Furthermore, it was evident that the P-containing CNNTs expanded the visible-light absorption range and the band potentials of P-CNNTs shifted to a higher level, demonstrating that a host–guest interaction was formed between the P dopant and the CNNTs. After doping with P, the nanocomposite showed an H2 generation rate of 67 μmol h−1 with an AQE of 5.68% at 420 nm.
P and S codoping is another type of nonmetal doping incorporated in CNNTs, which can promote an increased visible-light-induced photocatalytic H2 generation rate.124 During the doping process, different morphologies were obtained by adjusting the amount of precursors, diammonium phosphate, and dibenzyl sulfide (Fig. 12a). Fig. 12b shows that at various S and P doping contents, horn-like nanotubes, nanotubes, and tube-in-tube morphologies can be obtained. The S doping in the framework replaces a part of the –NH2 and the N sites and they can function as a bridge to form the hollow nanotubes. However, elemental P occupies some C and N sites to increase the surface energy. The optimal P and S codoped CNNTs (CNSP) presented two orders of magnitude higher H2 production rate (163.27 μmol h−1) than the CN nanosheets (Fig. 12c). Because of the effect of S and P codoping and the 1D tubular structure, the bandgap of CNSP was enlarged by 0.29 eV with downshifted CB and VB edges. The lower CB position favors the reduction reaction of CNSP (Fig. 12d). Additionally, the selective photodeposition experiments confirm that the codoping of P and S resulted in better polarization due to the synergistic effect of the tubular morphology and polarization. Therefore, the electrons migrate to the outer wall of the nanotubes, whereas the holes move to the inner sides, which is beneficial to enhance the photocatalytic performance.

4.1.2 Texture tailoring for improved H2 evolution. 
An appealing strategy to enhance the activities is to tailor the texture of the CNNTs with hierarchical,125 porous,100,104,126 3D assembly,127 and/or defective106,128,129 structures, which can increase their active sites and specific surface area within CN, thereby facilitating the light absorbance, charge transfer, molecular mass transport, and surface reactions. Mo et al. prepared CNNTs with abundant nitrogen defects by initially treating melamine with a hydrothermal reaction to produce supramolecular intermediates followed by thermal calcination.106 The resultant nanomaterial can induce a narrowed bandgap, enlarged surface area, and promoted charge carrier separation efficiency for the photocatalytic H2 production. Based on the XPS analysis, a reduction in the sp3-hybridized C–N(–C)–C bonds in the nitrogen-containing groups and an increased C/N atomic ratio of CNNTs (∼0.49) were observed. These defect-engineered CNNTs with a length–diameter ratio of 30:70 afford an H2 evolution rate of 118.5 μmol h−1, which is about 12.8 times that of bulk CN.
In another work by Liu et al., horn-like hollow mesoporous ultrathin (HHMU) CN tubes were fabricated via a one-pot co-pyrolysis strategy.130 During the processing, melamine reacted with ammonium bromide to generate a horn-like Br-containing intermediate and then HHMU CN tubes were formed after the further co-pyrolysis of NH4Br and melamine with the release of Br and other gases. Therefore, NH4Br played a vital role in the formation of this unique structure. With a molar ratio of ammonium bromide and melamine of 30, the resultant sample (CN-Br-3) exhibited a well-developed HHMU structure (Fig. 13b). Here, CN-Br-3 yielded an H2 production rate of 67.7 μmol h−1, which is approximately 6 times higher than that of bulk CN. This can be attributed to the multiple superiorities of high surface area and carrier density, boosted charge separation, and higher surface charge carrier mobility. The trend in the AQE on account of water splitting closely follows the UV-vis DRS curve, affording an AQE of 14.3% under 420 nm irradiation. Moreover, the sample maintained strong durability and high stability of 30 h in consecutive H2 evolution operations (Fig. 13c).

Recently, a 3D assembled CN structure was obtained by thermal polymerization.127 The nanostructure was investigated via its SEM images (Fig. 13a). The 3D assembled structure was made up of thick 1D tubes with many thinner 1D hollow tubes (inset in Fig. 13a) uniformly grown on their surfaces. The as-formed structure provides a larger surface area and more catalytically active sites. Therefore, the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity over the 3D assembled CNNTs reached 71 μmol h−1, which was about 11.2 times higher than that of bulk CN. Sun and co-workers successfully prepared hierarchical CNNTs with a porous coral-like structure.125Fig. 13d shows the synthesis process. Carbon-defective CN tubes with oxygen doping and a double-layer pipe–pipe CN (PCN) were initially prepared by a hydrothermal treatment; then, the hierarchical PCN with a porous bionic coral-like architecture (PCNC) was synthesized via a self-templating technique. An electron tomography analysis revealed that PCN exhibited a double-layered shell with a rougher inner layer, where some pores (indicated by red arrows) are observed (Fig. 13e(I)). For PCNC, a rod-like framework along the long axis and high porosity (indicated by red arrows) are observed (Fig. 13e(II)). The hierarchical CNNTs exhibit a decreased charge carrier transfer resistance and improved photoinduced electron lifetime as evidenced in the time-resolved PL spectra to prohibit charge recombination, and this characteristic facilitates H2 production from water splitting. Evidently, this novel architecture had a visible-light-induced H2 evolution rate of 105.80 μmol h−1 (estimated apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 32.4% at 420 nm), which was 36-fold that of bulk CN. The authors theoretically and experimentally examined the orbitals of the novel photocatalyst, along with bare CNNTs to elucidate the mechanisms behind the efficiently improved photoactivity. In particular, the light scattering in the hierarchical structure improves the mass transfer and solar-light harvesting. After P doping with defect content, the bandgap of the bulk CN increases from 2.73 to 2.83 eV and the positions of the midgap states are at −0.75 eV and −0.38 eV vs. NHE, both of which are higher than that for H2 generation, suggesting that the midgap states are thermodynamically capable to capture electrons for H2 production.


4.1.3 Heterojunction engineering for boosting H2 generation. 
Metal/CNNT-based heterojunctions. 
Bare CNNTs exhibit low activities for photoredox catalysis due to the lack of active sites and the fast recombination of electron–hole pairs. Therefore, a suitable cocatalyst with reasonable activity is always required to be loaded onto the CNNT surface to enhance the activities. The modification of CNNTs with metal NPs is a fascinating approach to construct metal/CNNT heterojunctions via the coherent interface. Overall, these heterojunctions play three important roles in (i) lowering the overpotential or the activation energy of the reduction reactions on the surface of the nanocomposites, (ii) hindering the electron–hole recombination at the interface due to the formation of the Schottky barrier, and (iii) preventing photocorrosion and enhancing their photochemical stability.131,132 Generally, impregnation–calcination and chemical reduction are the two main methods to load these metals onto semiconductor supports.
At present, Co, Ni, Cu, Ag, Pt, Au, Pd, La, and Rh monometallic NPs have been used as cocatalysts on CNNTs.74,133–138 Pt can be loaded onto CNNTs by a one-step solvothermal approach, where Pt4+ ions reduce to metallic Pt NPs with the assistance of ethanol. The sphere-like Pt NPs with an average diameter of about 5 nm are dispersed onto the surfaces of the CNNTs. With an optimal loading content of 2 wt%, the nanocomposites exhibited better activities than bare CNNTs in photocatalytic H2 production and degradation of aqueous p-chlorophenol (PCP).83 Bimetallic NPs have extraordinary physicochemical properties driven from the synergistic effects between the two metals.139 For instance, bimetallic Co–Pt NPs can be anchored onto CNNTs by a microwave heating approach, and homogeneously distributed Co–Pt NPs could be obtained because of the strong binding sites by N atoms within the sp2-hybridized carbon network. As a consequence, increased heterogeneous charge immigration and transfer can be achieved.140 Peng and co-workers presented an impregnation technique to develop bimetallic Pt–Ni/CNNT hybrid photocatalyst.141 Upon the chemical reduction decoration of Pt–Ni bimetallic alloy on the CNNTs, well-distributed Pt–Ni nanocrystals formed intact interfaces with the CNNTs (Fig. 14a–c), which facilitated efficient charge separation and electron transfer (Fig. 14d). Because of the formed Schottky barrier, when the bimetallic Pt–Ni NPs exhibit an optimal ratio of 1 and their loading mass content is 1 wt%, the catalyst exhibits the maximum production yield of H2 (104.70 μmol h−1), suggesting that noble Pt can be substituted by bimetallic Pt–Ni NPs.

By using the same method, Ag–Cu NPs were also deposited onto the surface of CNNTs to form Ag–Cu/CNNTs hybrid photocatalysts.142 As shown in Fig. 14e–g, the developed Ag–Cu species with diameters of around 10 nm were well dispersed over the internal and external CNNTs. The Ag–Cu/CNNTs catalyst exhibited the lowest intensity of PL signal compared with the other samples (Fig. 14h), indicating the highest charge separation rate due to the synergistic effect induced by Ag and Cu elements in the Ag–Cu NPs. In general, a better understanding of charge carrier dynamics would promote the exploration of novel CNNT-based and bimetallic-NP-decorated nanocatalysts toward the photochemical activities. Moreover, the studies of the role of various sacrificial reagents (TEA, TEOA, and methanol) in photocatalytic H2 generation demonstrated that TEA contributes to improved H2 yield due to the higher oxidation potential than TEOA and methanol during the photocatalytic process over Ag–Cu/CNNTs.
Semiconductor/CNNT-based heterojunctions. 
The selection of an appropriate semiconductor such as metal sulfide, metal oxide, complex compound, etc., is of vital importance in the construction of CNNT-based heterojunctions, not only to extend the light absorption but also to ameliorate the electron–hole transfer and separation.40,143 As mentioned above, because of the polymeric and geometric features, the CNNT structure is fairly flexible, which favors the formation of heterostructures with close interconnections.144 Conventionally, heterojunctions include Type I, Type II, and Type III alignments, and most of the nanocomposites described in this review belong to the Type II heterojunction.
MoS2 has emerged as a promising substitute for noble-metal-based cocatalyst because of its low cost, high electrical conductivity, and enhanced activity. Sun et al. grew 2D layered MoS2 onto CNNTs to construct 2D/1D heterojunctions via a freeze-drying method, and they could achieve high photocatalytic activity in producing H2.145 The 2D sheet structure of MoS2 on tubular CN is shown in Fig. 15a, and the as-developed photocatalyst with 15 wt% MoS2 has a high H2 evolution rate of 224.80 μmol h−1 with AQY of 2.34% at 420 nm, mainly caused by the improved carrier transfer and separation at the heterojunction interface (Fig. 15b). As shown in Fig. 15c, this composite has a unique 2D nanoflake/1D hollow nanotube structure with an increased number of active sites, which can capture more sunlight due to the multiple reflections of the incident light. Upon illumination by sunlight, electron–hole pairs are generated on the CNNTs; then, the electrons rapidly transfer and migrate to MoS2 to react with water for H2 production. Apart from MoS2 modification, CdS NPs with a low bandgap of around 2.4 eV can be incorporated onto CNNTs.146,147 By means of a hydrothermal codeposition method, Type II band alignment could be achieved because of the well-matched energy levels of CdS and CNNTs (Fig. 15d).146 This heterojunction eases the migration and transfer of the photoexcited electrons and holes and extends the visible-light absorption. Further, the nanocomposite alleviates the photocorrosion of CdS NPs from the interior photogenerated holes. As a consequence, the combination of CdS and CNNTs demonstrates enhanced photocatalytic activities in H2 evolution that is 16.3 times higher than that of bare CNNTs.

Except for metal sulfide semiconductors, metal oxides28,148,149 have also been decorated on the surface of CNNTs to form heterojunctions. In the research by Zhu and co-workers, the controllable heterojunction of CoOx (Co3O4 and CoO) NPs were assembled along the nanochannel of CNNTs from a one-pot method but under different annealing atmospheres.28 Under the vacuum condition, CoO/CNNTs were formed; fine CoO NPs of <8 nm were uniformly decorated on the inside and outside of the CNNTs (Fig. 15e), whereas Co3O4 NPs with a particle size of 20–80 nm were aggregated onto the surface of the CNNTs (Fig. 15f). The strategically decorated CoOx NPs can not only noticeably extend the visible-light absorption but also ameliorate the electron-capturing ability to lower the charge recombination rate. The maximum H2 production of 10.51 μmol h−1 could be achieved at an optimum CoO NP loading of 7 wt%. Upon coupling CNNTs with another semiconductor, band bending was created at the interface of the heterojunction owing to the potential difference. In turn, an internal electric field is formed within a space-charge region to spatially separate the photoexcited charges. It is interesting to note that the Co3O4/CNNT and CoO/CNNT nanostructures form a Type I and Type II heterojunction, respectively. In another study, Co3O4-NP-decorated CNNTs exhibited a much lower overpotential and stable current density.150
Constructing an isotype heterojunction of a single semiconductor is an economical and efficient strategy due to its weak differences in the band alignment at the interface, and improved photocatalytic activities from increased charge separation.151 A tubular metal-free CN isotype heterojunction was designed and prepared for the cooperative manipulation of oriented carrier transfer to promote photocatalytic H2 production.25 In this heterojunction, a rough layered CN was located on a flat CNNT by using a combination of self-assembly and thermal condensation methods. Yang et al. grew triazine-based CN NPs along heptazine-based CNNTs to form triazine-/heptazine-based CNNT homojunctions.152Fig. 16a shows that the as-formed robust heterojunction at 550 °C exhibits a high H2 evolution rate of 66.10 μmol h−1, which was about 12 times that of the bulk CN (5.51 μmol h−1). Under visible-light illumination, the photoexcited electrons transfer from the heptazine-based CNNTs to triazine-based CN NPs, whereas the holes immigrate from the CN NPs to CNNTs (Fig. 16b), thereby forming a bridge that facilitates the transfer of charge carriers across the heterojunction interface. Meanwhile, the tubular structure favors oriented electron transfer along the in-plane direction, which increases the efficiency of carrier separation.

Apart from bare semiconductors, modified semiconductors like nonmetal-doped CN or TiO2 with improved bandgap structures have been designed to further advance the physicochemical properties of CNNTs. Coral-like 3D porous P-doped CNNTs with 1D/2D architecture (named as PCNT) were synthesized via a combination of pyrolysis and freeze-drying approach.153 Phytic acid played a vital role in structural adjustment, as well as the photocatalytic performance. When the mass ratio of the phytic acid reached 3 wt%, PCNT yielded the highest H2 production of 101 μmol h−1, nearly 4.7 and 22.4 times those of bare CNNTs and bulk CN, respectively. Meanwhile, the calculated AQE was 4.32% at 420 nm, 3.58% at 450 nm, and 1.28% at 500 nm. After P doping, the intrinsic bandgap increased from 2.52 to 2.58 eV and the potential of CB was more negative at −0.33 V (vs. NHE). As shown in Fig. 16d, upon visible-light excitation (λ > 420 nm), the electron–hole pairs in the interior of the nanocomposite can rapidly separate and transfer to the surface along the interlayer direction. Therefore, the electrons migrate from the CB of the 2D nanosheets to that of the 1D tube, whereas the holes get injected into the VB of the nanosheets, leading to the oriented migration of the charge carriers. The high electron transfer on the pure tube along the longitudinal dimension can further enhance the charge separation efficiency. Moreover, the high specific surface area of the hierarchical structure also accommodates catalytically active centers and massive absorption and therefore facilitates the rapid transfer of the reactants.
In a paper by Li et al., C/X–TiO2 (X = N, F, Cl) were decorated on CNNTs to generate Type II heterojunctions.84 The tubular structures of CNNTs exhibit outer diameters of 40–80 nm and a wall thickness of 10–20 nm, which were formed by the condensation of the surface –OH on the CN nanosheets. The nonmetal-doped nanocomposites have stronger light-absorbance abilities compared with TiO2-CNNTs, which can be attributed to the increased electronic transition efficiency from the new VB to the CB constructed in the nanostructures (Fig. 16e). Because of the similarity in the electronic structures of N atoms in the TEA and –N groups in C/N–TiO2@CNNTs, the TEA molecules and C/N–TiO2@CNNTs have relatively strong affinity; as a result, C/N–TiO2@CNNTs exhibits the highest photocatalytic H2 generation among the several catalysts. On the other hand, the C/X–TiO2@CNNTs catalysts showed different photocatalytic performance in several oxidation reactions such as PCP, rhodamine B (RhB), or methyl orange (MO) pollutant degradation.
Other material-modified CNNT heterostructures. 
The discussions above mainly involve the decoration of CNNTs with metals and semiconductors for favorable light absorbance and charge separation. Other materials such as carbon molecules,27,154–156 metal–organic frameworks,157 and sensitizers158 have also shown potential prospects in photocatalysis. Due to the extraordinary structural, optical, and electronic features, carbonaceous materials with π-conjugated structures have been recognized as effective supports or cocatalysts to decorate with semiconductors to suppress charge recombinations. Several research groups have designed and synthesized heterojunctions by coupling CN with carbonaceous nanomaterials to advance its wide applications in the field of energy and environment. For example, Yang et al. designed a double-walled nanotube structure consisting of CNNT as the inside wall and CNT as the outside.159 Based on first-principles calculations, the photoexcited charge carriers in the nanostructure rapidly and efficiently separate, leaving holes at the oxidative sites in the CNT and electrons at the reductive sites in the CNNT.
In terms of CNNT supports, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) were implanted along the CNNTs by the thermal polymerization of freeze-dried urea and the prepared CQDs, where the processed CQDs could actively promote tube assembly.27 The morphological characterization shows that the thickness of the CNNT is less than 30 nm and several small QDs are dispersed on CNNTs showing microregional heterostructures between CQDs and CNNTs. The longer lifetime of CQD/CNNTs from the time-resolved PL decay spectra suggests an improvement in the photocarrier transport rate, which leads to distinct enhancement in the photocatalytic H2 production. This microregional heterostructure creates a work-function difference between the CQDs and CN during the fabrication process, providing high charge transfer kinetics. Further, the interaction in the two nanomaterials can optimize the electronic structures of the nanocomposite, resulting in decreased charge transfer.27 Consequently, the CQD/CNNTs presented efficient photocatalytic activity under visible-light illumination at a high H2 production rate (176.92 μmol h−1) and a notable AQE of 10.94% at 420 nm because of their high affinity and outstanding charge carrier mobility with the CN support.
At present, modified CNNT materials have fairly limited light absorption at longer wavelengths of solar energy despite a remarkable red-shift in the absorption edge. Sensitization is an important strategy to further expand the light absorption toward the near-infrared (NIR) region. NIR-triggered CNNT-based heterojunction photocatalysts have been designed and prepared by integrating upconversion NPs, namely, NaYF4:Yb, Tm, Gd (NYFG) and NaYF4:Yb, Tm (NYF), separately onto CNNTs, which can convert NIR to visible and UV light so that NIR can be fully utilized in photocatalysis.158 Upon NIR-light illumination, NYFG/CNNTs showed an H2 generation rate that was about 1.4 times higher than that of NYF/CNNTs. In contrast to NYF NPs, doped Gd3+ ions in NYFG give rise to double the light emission intensity and stronger interactions within the NYFG/CNNT heterojunctions. Benefited by the upconversion capability, NYFG functions as a light converter to provide additional light for photoexcitation in CNNTs to create more electron–hole pairs. Consequently, the ingenious energy-gap match between NYFG and CNNTs allows energy migration between the two nanocomponents dominated by a process of fluorescence resonance energy transfer and the surface quenching effect.
In short, as a metal-free, visible-light, responsive, and 1D tubular photocatalyst, a CNNT material is a promising semiconductor among the various photocatalysts available for H2 evolution from water splitting in the presence of sacrificial reagents. The bottom levels of their CB are different depending on the various synthesis methods, but they are negative than the reduction potential of H+/H2. Elemental doping, texture tailoring, and heterojunction engineering strategies have been explored to improve the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency from the points of enhancing the photon absorption, facilitating carrier transfer, and promoting mass transfer of the reactants. Currently, in CNNT-based photocatalytic systems, TEOA, TEA, methanol, lactic acid, methyl alcohol, Na2S, and Na2SO3 hole scavengers have been used; among these reagents, TEOA is the most popular due to its relatively high oxidation potential and low toxicity. However, in many studies, a Pt cocatalyst has been added during the photocatalytic process, which makes the system more expensive. Moreover, using μmol h−1 and/or AQE to compare the various reported H2 production efficiencies results in certain problems because the same photocatalyst can produce different H2 evolution efficiencies when tested in different labs.160 Therefore, it is better not to use the Pt cocatalyst and a reliable protocol should be followed when evaluating the photocatalytic H2 production activities of CNNT-based materials.161,162

4.2 Photocatalytic removal of pollutants
The photocatalytic degradation of hazardous and toxic pollutants has gained increasing research interest because of the low cost, ease of processing, and environmental friendliness. CNNT catalysts have been widely used in this respect due to their unique 1D structure and distinct optical and physicochemical properties. Recent studies on the photocatalytic degradation of various pollutants using CNNT-based materials are summarized in Table S2.† Generally, photodegradation reactions over CNNTs and its modified systems reported in the literature can be classified into two types: liquid-phase degradation of organic pollutants and gas-phase removal of contaminants.
The most widely used organic pollutants in the evaluation of the photocatalytic activities include methylene blue (MB),57,102 RhB,163,164 and MO.165,166 Other pollutants such as PCP,83,84 diethyl phthalate (DEP),82 bisphenol A (BPA),26 deoxynivalenol (DON),167 ethyl rhodamine B (ERB),75 carbamazepine (CBZ),168 oxytetracycline hydrochloride (OTC-HCl),169 and tetracycline hydrochloride (TC)106,170 have been used for the evaluation, too. Further, 12-tungstophosphoric acid (H3PW12O40), a widely used polyoxometalate with a bandgap of around 3.0 eV, is an efficient electron trap in photocatalytic reactions because of its well-defined Keggin structure.171 Li et al. designed H3PW12O40-doped CNNTs using a one-step hydrothermal treatment.82 The outer diameter of the nanotube is about 100 nm and the wall thickness is approximately 10 nm. Irregular pores can be seen on the walls due to the impact damage by the H3PW12O40 clusters. H3PW12O40/CNNTs exhibited efficient charge carrier transfer as a result of the electron-capturing ability of the Keggin units in the steady-state PL spectra. The nanocomposite with H3PW12O40 mass ratio of 30 wt% showed superior visible-light photocatalytic activity with respect to MO and DEP degradation relative to the bulk counterpart owing to the synergistic effect of the Keggin unit and CNNTs and the improved quantum efficiency derived from the unoccupied W 5d states.
In another study by Xie et al., AgCl NPs with an average size of 20 nm were incorporated onto CNNTs for the decomposition of RhB. Efficient visible-light-responsive photocatalytic activities were observed, which could be attributed to the improved separation rate of the charge carriers.164 In general, ˙O2− and h+ species are the two main reactive species in the CNNT-based photocatalytic reaction systems. However, from the electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis and scavenger experiments, Tang et al. found that the h+ species in the OA-modified CNNT nanomaterial demonstrate minimal impact on the degradation process; yet, ˙O2− and ˙OH radicals play a vital role in the photocatalytic reactions, which lead to the enhanced photocatalytic degradation rate of TC.102
It should be emphasized that CNNT-based Z-scheme heterojunctions present improved photocatalytic performance in contrast to bare CNNTs. Recently, Bai and co-workers reported a ternary ZnO/CN/graphene (CNTZG) system for DON photodegradation.167 In this reaction process, trapping experiments under UV and visible light were carried out to explore the main reactive species. Fig. 17d and e show that the degradation rate drastically declined with the addition of hydroxyl radical scavengers (tBuOH) and hole scavengers (KI), whereas it was slightly prohibited by purging N2 and O2, indicating that h+ and ˙OH could be the main reactive species and ˙O2− radicals played a minor role. Further evidence was also provided by ESR, showing that ˙OH radicals are mainly responsible for the degradation reaction and graphene is significant in the photocatalytic mechanism. Fig. 17f shows the schematic of the CNTZG sample, where graphene (RGO) works as a dual electron mediator changing the reaction pathway from the traditional Type-II to the Z-scheme process. Indeed, upon light illumination, the photogenerated holes in the VB of the outer binary CN/RGO material tend to inject into the CB of the inner ZnO/RGO, which then recombine with the electrons inside.

NOx is categorized as one of the main air pollutants owing to its dominance in atmospheric contamination such as acid rain and urban smog.172,173 As a catalyst, CNNTs with carbon vacancies have been prepared by the facile pyrolysis of melamine and urea under an N2 atmosphere. Under visible-light illumination, the photocatalytic activities of the catalysts obtained under various pyrolytic temperatures exhibited a Gaussian distribution trend, and the optimal photocatalytic NO removal rate reaches 47.7% over the sample calcined at 500 °C (denoted as TN 500).173 After five cycling tests, no significant attenuation is observed, suggesting the robust stability of the TN 500 material. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was conducted to precisely investigate the photocatalytic oxidation process over TN 500. Upon irradiation for 2 min, the band at 1064 cm−1 indexed to NO was gradually sluggish (Fig. 17a), implying the consumption of NO during the photocatalytic process. With the irradiation time ranging from 2 to 40 min, the reaction intermediates such as N2O5, NO2−/NO3− species, NO2+, and NO2 are detected (Fig. 17a and b). Based on the combination of the experimental analysis and theoretical DFT calculation, it is deduced that carbon vacancies in CNNTs greatly improve the adsorption of O2 and NO. In addition, the photoexcited electrons are trapped by carbon vacancies and subsequently react with adsorbed O2 to generate ˙O2− and ˙OH active species, which are responsible for NO conversion (Fig. 17f). Consequently, the unique tubular structure and carbon vacancies contribute to the enhanced photocatalytic selectivity in the oxidation of NO to NO3−.
For photocatalytic pollutant treatment, the key activation mechanism for CNNTs and CNNT-based materials originates from the reactive oxygen species and/or hole oxidation. The dominant reactive groups are different depending on the CNNT-based systems. Currently, the generation of these reactive species is inefficient for photocatalytic pollutant degradation. Therefore, it is highly desirable to maximize the production of active species by a reasonable design and the synthesis of CNNT-based nanohybrids, given that the nanocomposites can be prepared with different band edges.
4.3 Photocatalytic CO2 reduction
The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into fuels and valuable chemicals using semiconductor materials has been considered as a promising strategy to satisfy energy demands and minimize the greenhouse effect. Recent studies in this field have demonstrated that CNNTs can be employed as an effective candidate to drive photocatalytic CO2 reduction.174 During the photocatalytic process, CO2 can be converted into various chemicals under a proton-assisted multielectron process, and the reduction potentials can be found in other review articles.10,48 The selectivity and stability of the target product significantly depend on the choice of the active components and nanostructure design. Several CNNT-based photocatalysts, especially metal-free nanostructures, have been developed in CO2 photoreduction.85,130,175–178
Liu and co-workers developed P-doped CNNT photocatalysts using melamine and sodium hypophosphite monohydrate as the starting materials.176 During the copolymerization process, phosphine gas was released and played a vital role in transforming CN nanosheets into nanotubes, leading to an enlarged surface area and an amino-rich surface. The resultant P-CNNTs display multilayered nanotubes in the nanoscale with a diameter of 200 nm and a thickness of 20–50 nm. Based on the XPS analysis, it is evident that the phosphorus atom was interstitially doped into CNNTs in the form of PO43− instead of replacing the N and/or C atoms in CNNTs. Moreover, the P-CNNTs narrowed the bandgap from 2.70 to 2.60 eV, and the band positions slightly shifted to a lower level. The nanomaterial after doping could effectively photoreduce CO2 into CO and CH4 in the presence of water under visible-light irradiation. With P doping, better CO2 adsorption is observed, and the generation of CO and CH4 from CO2 is improved to 3.10 and 13.92 times than that on CN nanosheets, respectively. Besides, the total production ratio of CO/CH4 significantly decreases from 6.02 to 1.30, implying a higher selectivity of CH4 evolution.
Guo et al. applied CNNTs with nitrogen vacancies for the visible-light-induced photoreduction of CO2 to CO via a thermal etching approach.177 As confirmed by N2 sorption isotherms and the CO2 adsorption capacity isotherms, the obtained sample possessed a large specific surface area (207 m2 g−1) and a high CO2 uptake capacity (4.06 wt%), resulting in broadened visible-light absorption and prolonged charge carrier lifetime. Therefore, a better CO yield (43.9 μmol g−1 h−1) was obtained in the as-prepared nanomaterial relative to the unmodified bulk CN. Moreover, a simple supramolecular self-assembly method was adopted by Mo and co-workers for the synthesis of porous nitrogen-rich CNNTs with amino modification in an ammonia atmosphere (TCN(NH3)).178 The self-assembly atmosphere played a critical role in the morphology and the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. As shown in Fig. 18a, the optimal TCN(NH3) exhibited a drastically enhanced CO2-to-CO conversion rate (103.6 μmol g−1 h−1), with 17.0, 1.8, 2.7, and 2.8 times higher than that of bulk CN, TCN(air), TCN(Ar), and TCN(N2), respectively. Meanwhile, the sample also presented high photocatalytic stability without any evident decrease in the product yield by adding fresh TEOA (Fig. 18b). This high activity can be attributed to the enhanced light capture via multiple reflections, thereby facilitating the adsorption of CO2 and desorption of CO. Benefited by the amino groups, the TCN(NH3) calcined at 200 °C has strong CO2 adsorption as confirmed in CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) patterns (Fig. 18d). From the theoretical calculations shown in Fig. 18e and f, TCN(NH3) has higher CO2 adsorption energy than TCN without Lewis basicity and is beneficial for CO release. To verify the formed CO originated from CO2, 13C-labeled isotope tracer experiment from the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was performed; a strong signal corresponding to 13CO (at m/z = 29) was observed, concluding that CO2 molecules are the source of the generated CO (Fig. 18c).

The abovementioned cases demonstrate that CNNTs and CNNT-based nanohybrids exhibit promising prospects in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The currently reported efficiency of solar energy to CO2 conversion is still low and far from industrialization capability. Moreover, the mechanism of product selectivity for CO2 photoreduction is not clearly investigated because of the diversity of products via various reaction ways. CO2 adsorption is a prerequisite step for the photoreduction of CO2. Therefore, it is desirable to construct new CNNT-based materials such as induced defect or dopant levels and porous textures to enhance CO2 adsorption capacity and therefore improve the product selectivity.
4.4 Other potential applications
In addition to the aforementioned photocatalytic applications, CNNT-based nanohybrids also have great potential in the field of electrochemical devices,179–182 sensing,183–186 energy storage,187–189 conventional catalytic reactions,190,191 membrane separation,192,193 and others.194–197 In this section, conventional catalytic reactions and energy storage applications are introduced with some typical examples.

4.4.1 Conventional catalytic reactions. 
Benzylmalononitrile synthesis is drawing attention in various fields as benzylmalononitrile is synthetically a key intermediate for antimalarial preparation. Tahir et al. immobilized Pd NPs on the inner surface of triazine-based CNNTs for the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of benzaldehyde to benzylmalononitrile.134 The as-synthesized catalyst exhibited higher catalytic performance than the activities of Pd/bulk CN, with benzene conversion of 99.9% and 99.2% selectivity to benzylmalononitrile. The high catalytic performance of Pd/triazine-based CNNTs in the reaction was attributed to the large amine groups, particularly –NH2 and –NH species, and high catalytic activities of the decorated Pd NPs. Additionally, the anchor effect by N atoms from triazine-based CNNTs stabilized and prevented the loss of Pd NPs, resulting in the excellent recyclability with eight cycles for the synthesis of benzylmalononitrile.
These advanced nanomaterials also show agglomeration-free peroxidase activities including the catalytic oxidation of the organic substrates such as 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to reduce their toxicity. Kang et al. reported the synthesis of magnetic Fe3O4-NP-loaded CNNTs by a solvothermal method for peroxidase mimetic activity.195 With a microwave heating time of 90, 120, and 150 s, the resulting Fe3O4 species exhibited average diameters of around 2.3 (H-1), 4.9 (H-2), and 7.9 (H-3) nm. Vibrating-sample magnetometer analyses reveal that larger Fe3O4 NPs induce higher magnetization. Additionally, the magnetic properties of the external magnetic field could be visualized, suggesting the high recovery features of this nanocomposite. The H-2 nanocatalysts with the water-soluble property exhibited the highest peroxidase mimetic activities of measuring the oxidation extent for TMB in the presence of H2O2. This group fabricated Co3O4/CNNT hybrid catalysts by the two-step synthesis for TMB peroxidase-like activity in a follow-up study.191


4.4.2 Energy storage. 
Among the diverse strategies for energy storage, the Li-ion battery has attracted enormous interest in portable electronic devices, such as laptops, cell phones, digital cameras, and so on. Pan et al. theoretically predicted that porous CNNTs have higher potential for use in Li-ion batteries with relatively good density and stability as Li atoms can easily access the interior of CNNTs via the pores in the walls.198 Besides, this prediction has been experimentally validated by Xie's group. The pores on the tubular structure are favorable for lithium intercalation; therefore, based on the experimental results, a much higher irreversible and reversible capacity of 816.6 mA h g−1 for the first circle can be observed, which was better than that of the theoretical capacity of graphite.91 Benefitting from the specific tubular morphology in the nanoscale, ion transport under a salinity or pressure gradient through the CNNTs can generate electric potential due to selective ion diffusion. Recently, Xiao et al. developed CNNT-based membrane for use in an ionic photodetector. It was on the base of the asymmetric surface charge induced by the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes. Without an external power supply, this photodetector exhibited a high signal-to-noise ratio, high spectrum selectivity, fast response speed, and high sensitivity and stability.89 Meanwhile, this group also applied CNNTs for photo-rechargeable electric energy storage and photovoltaic system based on ion transport.88,90
In short, the above studies demonstrated the prospects of other applications over various types of CNNT-based nanomaterials. However, research into the use of CNNTs for these fields is still at the initial stage, and extensive investigations of the potential applications over CNNT-based hybrid nanostructures are highly encouraged.

5. Conclusions and perspectives
To date, efforts dedicated to the CNNT-based hybrid nanocomposites have enriched our knowledge on their formation, properties, modifications, and versatile energy- and environment-related applications. In this review, we present the state-of-the-art development of the synthesis of 1D CNNTs with different geometries from various precursors such as melamine, urea, cyanuric chloride, and gases. Among them, single melamine and mixed precursors using the template-free techniques are the most popular in CNNT preparation because of the green and easy operation process and rational control of the CNNTs. Benefited from the large specific surface area, more active sites and mass diffusion, and excellent electronic charge transfer properties along the axial direction and unique optical properties, CNNT-based nanocomposites have been widely used in photocatalytic H2 production, pollutant photodegradation, CO2 photoreduction, energy storage, and other fields. We also review the attempts in CNNT modification including elemental doping, texture tailoring, and heterojunction engineering, and these efforts are mainly to extend solar-light harvesting, hinder charge carrier recombination, and increase surface adsorption of the reactant species. The modification techniques give rise to a series of CNNT-based heterostructures for better activities.
Despite these promising achievements, there are still great opportunities and challenges on the functionalities and performances of CNNTs and CNNT-based materials. Further theoretical studies employing first-principles DFT calculations on the mechanisms of the geometry–property relationship of CNNTs are necessary for achieving a better understanding and utilization of their merits. To realize the controllable preparation of high-performance CNNTs, combined efforts of computational simulations and experimental work are required in the future for a better understanding of the influence of tube geometries and uniformity on the physicochemical properties, mechanical properties, and photocatalytic activities. Meanwhile, modeling the functional groups, doping, and defects on CNNT-based nanocomposites is indispensable to further reveal the key roles of CNNTs and modifications in the various reactions, such as the surface/interfacial processes, molecular orbitals, and charge transfer dynamics. Therefore, future cooperation between theoretical and experimental investigations can provide a logical framework to further advance the current state of our knowledge.
The efficiency of solar-to-valuable chemicals is still relatively low and far from the requirement of practical applications. With the rapid development of materials science and nanotechnology, future research on preparing novel nanocomposites such as metal–organic framework/CNNTs, carbonaceous material/CNNTs, and conducting polymer/CNNT heterostructures, new types of heterojunctions based on the Z scheme or S scheme are highly encouraged to further improve the conversion efficiency. For instance, it will be promising to design CNNT-based structures with high light-harvesting abilities toward the visible-NIR region, low cost, and fast charge migration. Moreover, after the photocatalytic process, it is usually difficult to separate the powder nanomaterials from water. Therefore, it is meaningful to find a specific substrate to immobilize the powders for recovery and then scale it up for the industry.
In view of the good photocatalytic performances of CNNT-based nanohybrids in photocatalysis, work on the platforms of ammonia synthesis from N2 reduction, O2 evolution, and elimination of pollutants in air (e.g., volatile organic compounds, SO2, and H2S) has gained less attention than expected. However, these are the major environmental- and energy-related issues around the world, too; therefore, CNNTs have great potential in these fields and more efforts should be devoted toward these applications of CNNT-based composite photocatalysts. Besides, further investigations of the reaction pathways are needed to elucidate the fundamental enhancements and further optimization of the photoactivity, as well as to promote a comprehensive understanding of the photocatalytic mechanisms. Therefore, in situ observations based on material characterizations and fundamental studies are highly desirable to further advance the development in renewable fuels and environmental remediation.
Looking forward, numerous opportunities and challenges await researchers that will need to be overcome in the field of CNNT-based nanocomposites. We believe that this comprehensive review can provide deeper insights into CNNT-based nanostructures, and it should be of great value toward achieving high efficiency for practical applications, thereby promoting the industrialization of more materials.
