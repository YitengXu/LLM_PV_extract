    , Accepted 28th February 2020First published on 2nd April 2020Abstract4-Aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is one of the earliest patented and most commonly used sunscreen components. There is however a long-lasting controversy on its photo-protective efficacy owing to the lack of information on its protolytic equilibrium and photo-dynamics after absorption of ultraviolet radiation in physiologically relevant aqueous solution. The excitation dynamics in water also remains largely unknown for analogs of PABA such as 4-dimethylaminoacetophenone (DMAAP) and 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (DMABA) which are recognized as prototypes for photo-induced twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT). Herein we report a combined application of femtosecond broadband time-resolved fluorescence and transient absorption coupled with density functional theoretical study for PABA, DMAAP, and DMABA under several solvent conditions with representative properties in terms of the pH, polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity. The results we gained demonstrate that, in a neutral aqueous solution, PABA taking the deprotonated anion form in the ground state undergoes rapid protonation after excitation, producing excited state species in the neutral form that may shift effectively by intersystem crossing (ISC) to the long-lasting triplet state capable of damaging nucleic acids. This provides evidence at the molecular level for the detrimental effect of PABA if used as a sunscreen ingredient. In contrast, our investigation on DMAAP and DMABA unveils an unusual solvent controlled deactivation dynamics rendered by the participation of the carbonyl oxygen associated nOπ* state featuring energy and structure strongly responsive to solvent properties. In particular, these molecules in water exhibit solute–solvent hydrogen bonding at the sites of the carbonyl oxygen and the amino nitrogen which is, respectively, weakened and strengthened after the excitation, leading to state reversal and formation of a nOπ* state with a peculiar non-planar structure. This quenches strongly the excitation, eliminates the TICT, suppresses the ISC and opens up the otherwise inaccessible internal conversion (IC) to account for ∼80% of the entire deactivation. The IC, observed to proceed at a rate of ∼2.5 ps, allows the effective recovery of the ground state, providing substantial protection against ultraviolet irradiation. Moreover, the revelation of highly solvent sensitive fluorescence emission from DMABA and DMAAP implies the potential application of these molecules as the functional element in the design of sensory materials for probing the polarity and hydrogen bonding character of the surrounding environment.
Introduction
4-Aminobenzoic acid (PABA; Scheme 1) is an essential component for the synthesis of folic acid,1,2 which is commonly known as vitamin B9. It is also a frequently used building block for the design of drugs and many biologically active molecules with antibacterial functions.2,3 Aside from these, PABA is one of the earliest patented organic ultraviolet (UV) absorbers in sunscreens, responsible for absorbing the solar UVB radiation (at ∼320–280 nm) thanks to its broad and strong absorption in this range of wavelengths.4,5
 Scheme 1  Structures of the studied and related compounds and the protolytic equilibrium of PABA in water. 
Due to its widespread usage as a sunscreen ingredient, PABA has been subjected to extensive assessment, both in vitro and in vivo, to evaluate its efficacy and photostability.6–8 The in vivo studies produced mixed results showing that, although after UV irradiation it may interact directly or indirectly with DNA, PABA could help alleviate DNA damage on mice skin to a certain extent.7 The results of the in vitro studies show that PABA could sensitize DNA to form a detrimental cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photoproduct in bacterial and mammalian cells.6a It may also induce a photochemical reaction to produce adducts with thymine in DNA and was thereby categorized as a potential photo-carcinogen.6b,7 To resolve the discrepancy in its suitability as a sunscreen agent and the cause of its probable photo-damaging effects, it demands an in-depth understanding of the excitation dynamics and deactivation pathways underlying the photo-excited PABA.
Aside from the abovementioned applications, PABA is also important from a fundamental point of view. With the amino group as the electron donor (D) and the benzoic acid moiety as the electron acceptor (A), PABA belongs to a large family of A–D molecules that may undergo solvent dependent intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) after photoexcitation.9–11 On the other hand, possessing two possible protonation sites (the amino nitrogen and carbonyl oxygen), PABA in aqueous solution takes different protolytic forms depending on the pH conditions.12,13 According to its protolytic dissociation equilibrium (Scheme 1),14 the carboxylate anionic form (A form hereafter) dominates at pH > 4.87; while it assumes mainly the neutral form (N form hereafter) at 4.87 < pH < 2.50 and the nitrogen protonated cationic form (C form hereafter) at pH < 2.50.14 Despite these intrinsic significant properties, there are only a few investigations on the excited states of PABA. These studies involved mainly the spectra from the UV absorbing locally excited (LE) state without the involvement of the ICT.10,11 They also reported observation of a long-lived triplet state in the deoxygenated glassy EPA environment at low temperature.15,16 The precise excited state dynamics of this molecule in general, and those in aqueous solution whose situation is further complicated by the protolytic dissociation in particular, have however remained largely unknown.
Unlike PABA, its derivatives 4-dimethylaminoacetophenone (DMAAP) and 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (DMABA, Scheme 1), possessing a better electron donating DMA group, exhibit excitation induced ICT in polar aprotic solvents as indicated by their dual emission spectra comprising not only the normal fluorescence from the photo-prepared LE state but also an abnormally red-shifted component due to the so-called twisted ICT (TICT) state.17,18 However, different from the prototype A–D molecules such as 4-dimethylaminoacetonitrile (DMABN), MDMABA and EHDMABA (Scheme 1) that have the ICT as the major nonradiative channel to deactivate the LE state, the decay of excitation for the reported case of DMAAP and DMABA resulted from two competing processes: the ICT and intersystem crossing (ISC) to yield the long living triplet state.19 The ISC likely from a low lying nπ* state was reported to be the main deactivation channel in nonpolar solvents. In addition, earlier studies on DMABA suggested likely participation of internal conversion (IC) which could be more important for deactivation in polar than nonpolar solvents.20 Previous steady state and density functional theory (DFT) studies reported different spectra in polar aprotic solvents from those in protic alcohols and suggested involvement of hydrogen bonding between DMABA and the alcoholic solvent molecules.18 However, the interplay between the ICT, ISC and IC and how this is affected by the properties of solvent are unclear. The electronic nature and excited state dynamics of these molecules in physiologically relevant aqueous solution also remain a largely unexplored area.
In recent years, there has been increasing interest in clarifying the “sunscreen controversy” and understanding the main reason for the efficacy and safety of organic UV filters. This has led to growing research effort in applying state-of-the-art ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy to elucidate the excited state dynamics for the photoprotective or photodamaging side effect of some ubiquitous sunscreen constituents.4,21 Many of these studies have shown that the UV blocking capacity of these compounds originated from their excited states possessing effective channels to dissipate the excitation energy in the form of heat. This can be achieved through a range of rapidly occurring deactivation processes including the sub-picosecond to several picosecond excited state hydrogen transfer (ESPT) accompanied by enol–keto tautomerization for methyl salicylate,22 oxybenzone23 and avobenzone,24 and the picosecond trans–cis isomerization for the family of sinapoyl malate25 and cinnamate molecules.26 On the other hand, the harmful side effect is rendered mostly due to the involvement of the long living optically “dark” state, especially the triplet nature state that is known to induce the formation of reactive species, e.g., the singlet oxygen,27 which may eventually damage DNAs.6a,28
One essential aspect in this context is the role of the solvent microenvironment in shaping the excitation dynamics and regulating the photo-protective vs photo-damaging effect of sunscreen molecules. In particular, water as a solvent may cause a dramatic change in the decay paths seen in commonly used organic solvents.26a,29,30 For instance, our recent studies on PABA related UVB filters MDMABA and EHDMABA (Scheme 1) reveal that water molecules, by forming strongly enhanced hydrogen bonding with their TICT state, may cause elimination of the highly efficient ISC to the triplet state as shown in CH3CN, allowing operation of a very rapid IC to enable, at the molecular level, an effective mechanism for photoprotection.29,30
As an extension of our previous work and to help address the abovementioned issues on the excited state dynamics of PABA, DMAAP and DMABA, we report here a combined application of broadband femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence (fs-TRF) and fs-TA spectroscopy in combination with DFT and TDDFT calculations for these molecules in solvents of varied properties. The result we gained provides comprehensive characterization and the first direct probe of specific spectra, dynamics, and structural variations occurred after the excitation for the respective systems. It underscores a decisive role of water through hydrogen bonding interactions in bringing about some hitherto unknown deactivation pathway that is not feasible in other solvents. The finding of this work enriches knowledge on the nonradiative dynamics of A–D molecules in general, and it also supplies concrete evidence for resolving the “sunscreen controversy” on PABA and its derivatives.
Results and discussion
A. Steady state absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy of PABA

Fig. 1 shows steady state absorption and fluorescence spectra recorded from PABA in CH3CN and buffered aqueous solutions with pH 4, pH 7 and pH 11. The spectra of both absorption and fluorescence in CH3CN are from the neutral form of PABA (denoted as the N form hereafter). According to the acid–base equilibrium (Scheme 1), the absorption in the pH 4 aqueous solution is primarily due to the N form of PABA while those in the pH 7 and pH 11 solutions are its anionic form (referred to as the A form hereafter). It can be seen that the absorption spectrum exhibits the lowest energy band with the maximum absorption wavelength (λa) and the associated extinction coefficient (ε) varying depending on the solvent conditions.16,31 The N form absorption in CH3CN and in pH 4 buffer displays a spectrum with λa of ∼286 nm (ε = ∼18300 M−1 cm−1) and ∼283 nm (ε = ∼16200 M−1 cm−1), respectively. The absorption of the A form under the neutral (pH 7) and alkaline (pH 11) conditions is blue-shifted by ∼21 nm (λa = 265 nm) and with a decrease in the extinction coefficient (∼14500 M−1 cm−1) relative to that of the N form spectrum. The above spectral parameters (compiled in Table 1) agree well with those reported in the literature.10,16,32 In view of the sufficiently large extinction coefficient, it is reasonable to assign the lowest energy absorption band under all the conditions examined to the ππ* localized excitation with the various absorption wavelengths and extinction coefficients reflecting the change in the solvent properties and the varied species involved.

From Fig. 1, it can be seen that the fluorescence spectra in all the solvents examined exhibit a single fluorescence band with the maximum fluorescence wavelength (λf) being slightly different from occurring at ∼328 nm in CH3CN to ∼338 nm in the pH 7 and pH 11 buffer and ∼340 nm in the pH 4 solution. The fluorescence observed in CH3CN and the neutral and alkaline solutions is consistent with that reported previously.10,16,31,32 One important feature is that the quantum yield of the fluorescence (Φf) in various solvents differs dramatically with the value of Φf changing from ∼0.31 in CH3CN to ∼0.08 in pH 7 and 11 buffer and decreasing significantly to ∼6.5 × 10−3 in the pH 4 solution (Table 1). The large variation in Φf is indicative of a markedly altered excited state dynamics upon the change in solvent conditions. It is worth noting that the identical absorption and fluorescence spectra shown in the pH 7 and pH 11 solutions reflect the involvement of the same set of species for both absorption and emission transitions under the two solvent conditions.14 The significantly reduced Φf in the solvents from CH3CN to pH 4 buffer implies that after excitation the N form species is strongly quenched under the latter compared to the former conditions.
B. Femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopy of PABA in CH3CN
In order to reveal the excited state dynamics of the N form PABA, we have first conducted fs-TRF and fs-TA measurements for the molecule in CH3CN. The fs-TRF and the fs-TA spectra obtained are respectively depicted in Fig. 2 and 3.
 Fig. 2  Temporal evolution of the fs-TRF spectra of PABA recorded at (a) 0.1–10 ps and (b) 10–6000 ps in CH3CN after the excitation. The inset in (a) shows the normalized fluorescence spectral evolution at an early time of up to 3.5 ps after the excitation; the inset in (b) displays the experimental and fitted (—) decay profiles at 330 nm (○) of the TRF spectra. The arrows indicate the direction of the temporal evolution of the TRF spectra. 
 Fig. 3  Temporal evolution of fs-TA of PABA recorded in CH3CN at (a) 0.1–50 ps (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.25, 4, 15, 50 ps) and (b) 50–3000 ps (50, 150, 350, 600, 1000, 1750, 3000 ps) and in the pH 7 aqueous solution at (c) 0.2–1.75 ps (0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.85, 1.75 ps) and (d) 1.75–2500 ps (1.75, 7, 25, 40, 150, 350, 700, 1250, 2500 ps) after the excitation. The insets in (b) show the spectral evolution at 3000–6000 ps (3000, 4000, 6000 ps) in CH3CN and at (d) 2500–6000 ps (2500, 3500, 6000 ps) in the pH 7 aqueous solution. The arrows show the direction of temporal evolution of the fs-TA spectra. Experimental and fitted (—) decay profile of the fs-TA (e) at 340 (○), 400 (□) and 640 nm (△) of PABA in CH3CN; and (f) at 350 (○), 400 (□), and 640 nm (△) in the pH 7 aqueous solution. 
It can be seen from Fig. 2 that, promptly after the excitation, the TRF spectrum (at 0.1 ps) exhibits a fluorescence band peaking at ∼330 nm, arising from the photo-populated LE state producing the fluorescence seen also in the steady state spectrum (Fig. 1). The initial spectrum displayed an increase in intensity (Fig. 2a) accompanied by the narrowing of the spectral bandwidth in several picoseconds (inset in Fig. 2a) followed by decay and disappearance of the fluorescence 6000 ps after the excitation (Fig. 2b). The initial rise and ensuing decay of the TRF intensity are derived featuring a time constant of ∼3.86 ps and ∼1100 ps, respectively (inset of Fig. 2b, Fig. S1, ESI† and Table 1).
The 3.86 ps time constant is likely a result of the combined action of several processes, including solvent reorganization,33 excited state vibrational relaxation, structural change and energy dissipation to the solvent which are known to occur in the timescale of several picoseconds after the excitation and manifested by the narrowing of the transient spectrum from the excited state. The increase in the TRF intensity is however an interesting observation. This as suggested by the theoretical calculation may originate mainly from the photo-induced structural change causing a sizable increase in the radiative rate constant. Our DFT calculation shows that, in comparison to the ground state (S0), the LE state has a more planar structure in terms of the sum of the N-centred bond angles (348.6° cf. 353.2°) and with a shortened C–N bond length (1.371 Å cf. 1.384 Å) (Fig. S2, ESI†). This leads to an enhanced conjugation between the amino nitrogen and the ring system16,34,35 and, according to our TDDFT calculation, also a greater oscillator strength (f, Table S1, ESI†) for the optical transition from the LE state (f = 0.79) than from S0 (f = 0.55). Therefore, the LE state upon relaxation and departure from the Franck–Condon (FC) region becomes more emissive, contributing to the early time increase in the TRF intensity. With the obtained value of fluorescence quantum yield and the decay time of TRF, we estimate that the LE state after structural relaxation has a radiative rate of ∼2.8 × 108 s−1.
The fs-TA spectra (Fig. 3) acquired for PABA in CH3CN contain information on not only the strongly emitting LE state but also the weakly emissive long living triplet state of PABA in the N form. The early time TA spectra (∼0.1 ps after the excitation, Fig. 3a), arising from the LE state, feature a broad positive excited state absorption (ESA) from ∼400 to 700 nm and a negative signal at ∼330 nm corresponding to the stimulated emission (SE) of the LE state. After this, the spectrum decays leading to a conversion to a different spectrum with the absorption peaking at ∼400 nm. The ∼400 nm spectrum is long living and persists with no decay in intensity 6000 ps after the excitation. The ∼400 nm spectrum closely resembles the triplet state absorption from MDMABA and EHDMABA30,36 (Scheme 1) and is assigned to the triplet state (T1) of the N form PABA. The spectral conversion, producing two isosbestic points (at ∼322 and 422 nm) as shown in Fig. 3b, is thus due to the ISC from the LE to the T1 state.
Global analysis of TA time profiles at representative wavelengths (Fig. 3e) shows that the kinetic changes of the transient signal associated with the SE (at 340 nm) and absorption (at 640 nm) of the LE state and the growth of the 400 nm absorption due to the T1 state can be described reasonably well with the same time constants derived from the dynamics of fs-TRF (Fig. 2b and Fig. S1, ESI†). This corroborates nicely the observation of the isosbestic points during the course of spectral transformation, indicating that the ISC is an important nonradiative channel for the LE state deactivation, occurring at a time constant of ∼1100 ps. On the other hand, the kinetic analysis indicated requirement of at least one additional component with a time constant of ∼1.2 ps and a small fractional contribution of ∼4–8% depending on the wavelength for simulation of these TA time profiles in the early timescale after the excitation (Fig. S3a, ESI†). This is however not surprising, and is attributable to the abovementioned early time dynamic relaxation of the LE state, arising from spectral evolution analogous to the narrowing of the transient spectra in the inset in Fig. 2a.
C. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy of PABA in aqueous solution
Next, we conducted fs-TA measurements for PABA in the pH 7 buffer where the molecule is predominantly (>95%) in the A form (Scheme 1). The pH 7 aqueous condition is more relevant to the physiological environment the molecule could be subjected to after it enters the cell when applied on skin.6a,28Fig. 3e, f and Fig. S3 (ESI†) compare the temporal evolutions of the fs-TA recorded in the pH 7 buffer to those in CH3CN.
From Fig. 3c, it can be seen that the TA spectrum at the initial time (0.2 ps) after the excitation features a strong ESA at ∼316 nm along with a negative band at ∼350 nm due to the SE and a broad absorption across ∼400–700 nm. This spectrum, originated from the photo-prepared LE state of the A form PABA (referred to as A*), was found evolving with a time constant of ∼0.52 ps into a feature with enhanced absorption at wavelengths from ∼400 to 700 nm (Fig. 3c). This feature, represented by the 1.75 ps spectrum in Fig. 3c, is very similar to the TA spectrum of the N form LE state (denoted as N*) as recorded with PABA (at ∼0.5 ps) in the pH 4 buffer when its N form dominated (Fig. S4, S5, ESI,† and Scheme 1). Based on this observation, the 0.52 ps spectral evolution is attributable to a process corresponding to the protonation of the photo-populated A* species to produce the N* state in aqueous solution at pH 7.
Subsequent to this, the TA spectrum (from N*) exhibited transformation into the profile peaking at ∼400 nm (Fig. 3d) characteristic of the T1 state of the N form as revealed by the measurement in CH3CN (Fig. 3b). It can be seen that this spectral change is accompanied by the production of two isosbestic points at ∼322 and ∼422 nm and the ∼400 nm spectrum is long lived, persisting with nearly no decay in intensity 6000 ps after the excitation (inset in Fig. 3d). This corroborates its assignment to the triplet state. Analysis of the TA intensity time profiles representative of the N* state decay at ∼640 nm and growth of the T1 spectrum at ∼400 nm (Fig. 3d) revealed a conversion time constant of ∼660 ps.
It is worth noting that the ∼660 ps lifetime of the N* (LE) state in the pH 7 buffer is substantially shorter than the lifetime of the LE state in CH3CN (∼1100 ps). This shorter lifetime suggests possible involvement of an additional procedure competing with the ISC for the deactivation of the LE (N*) state in the buffer solution. However, a comparison of the counterpart spectra in Fig. 3b and in Fig. 3d shows that the spectrum of T1 in the buffer solution features intensity (ΔO.D. = ∼10 at 400 nm) comparable to that of the T1 absorption in CH3CN. Given that the measurements in the two solutions were conducted under parallel conditions in terms of the absorption at an excitation wavelength, this implies that in the pH 7 aqueous solution the efficiency of ISC for the production of the triplet state is not significantly different from that in CH3CN.
Taking together the above experimental and calculated results, the deactivation mechanism of PABA in CH3CN and in the pH 7 aqueous solution can be established (Scheme 2). In CH3CN, the photo-prepared LE (N*) state, after the ∼3.9 ps relaxation (including structural, vibrational and solvent reorganization), is deactivated with ∼1.1 ns lifetime accompanied by the formation of the T1 state through the ISC.
 Scheme 2  Major deactivation pathways proposed for PABA in (a) CH3CN and (b) pH 7 aqueous solution. 
In the pH 7 buffer, the initial photo-populated LE state of the A* species undergoes rapid protonation in the site of carboxylate oxygen (∼0.5 ps time constant), converting into the neutral form LE state (N*). The N* LE state then decays with ∼660 ps lifetime concurrent also with the production of the T1 state. The very rapid rate of the protonation (A* → N*) is likely a result of the enhanced basicity of the carboxylate oxygen in the LE (A*) state rendered due to partial charge transfer associated with the La nature electronic excitation.16 Moreover, despite the shorter lifetime of the LE (N*) state in the pH 7 buffer (∼660 ps) than that in CH3CN (∼1.1 ns), which implies the possible involvement in the former of extra nonradiative channels, comparison of the fs-TA in Fig. 3 suggests similar efficiencies of the T1 state formation in the two systems.
D. Steady state absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy of DMAAP and DMABA

Fig. 4 and Fig. S6 (ESI†) show steady state absorption and fluorescence spectra from DMAAP and DMABA in cyclohexane (C6H12), acetonitrile (CH3CN) and water (H2O). The absorption and fluorescence spectra of both the samples share similar spectral features in all the three solvents examined. Taking DMAAP as an example, the absorption spectra in all these solvents exhibit the lowest energy band with a large maximum extinction coefficient (ε = ∼2.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1). The maximum absorption wavelength (λa) of the absorption displays a clear red-shift from ∼315 nm in C6H12 to ∼326 nm in CH3CN and then to ∼347 nm in H2O (Table 1). The large extinction coefficients suggest a nature of ππ* transition for the absorption band, agreeing well with the literature and our theoretical calculation (Table 2),17,19 while the substantial red-shifts of λa reflect the importance of the solvents in affecting the electronic absorption.

The fluorescence spectra in the three solvents are markedly different in terms of both the spectral profile (Fig. 4 and Fig. S6, ESI†) and the fluorescence quantum yield (Φf, Table 1). For instance, the fluorescence in C6H12, not reported in the literature to the best of our knowledge, features a single fluorescence band with a λf of ∼334 nm and an extremely low quantum yield of ∼8 × 10−5, while in CH3CN the spectrum exhibits dual emission with Φf = ∼5.5 × 10−3 comprising a “blue” component with a λf of ∼384 nm and a “red” component at ∼538 nm. This is consistent with previous studies18,20 where the “blue” and “red” components were attributed, respectively, to the photo-prepared LE state and a state produced by intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the dimethylamino to benzaldehyde moiety.
It is however surprising that the fluorescence in H2O exhibits only a single emission band with λf at ∼413 nm and fairly low quantum yield (Φf = ∼4.5 × 10−4). This is in contrast to the case of the ester analogues (MDMABA and EHDMABA, Scheme 1) and some other closely related D–A molecules where the dual emission was also observed in protic solvents, including water, though with decreased contribution of the ICT fluorescence due to the charge transfer induced enhanced solute–solvent H-bonding and the increased rate of nonradiative decay from the ICT state.9a,29,30 This significant solvent dependent fluorescence behavior is indicative of a markedly altered excited state dynamics due to the change in solvation conditions in these three different types of solvents.
E. Femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy of DMAAP and DMABA
To reveal the effect of solvents on their excited state dynamics, we have conducted fs-TRF coupled with fs-TA measurements for the two compounds in the three solvents; the results obtained are depicted in Fig. 5, 6 and Fig. S7–S11 (ESI†). It can be seen that the two compounds exhibited nearly identical features of the fs-TRF and TA in the three solvents. The following description uses the data from DMAAP to illustrate the variation in the excited state behavior in the different solvents.

The arrows indicate temporal evolution of the spectra. The inset in (a) shows the temporal evolution of the fs-TRF in CH3CN at 10–6000 ps (10, 30, 200, 500, 1000, 6000 ps) after the excitation.

The arrows indicate the direction of temporal evolution of the TA spectra. Experimental and fitted (—) decay profiles at indicated wavelengths of the TA spectra in (g) C6H12, (h) CH3CN and (i) H2O. 

Femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. 
In C6H12, our fs-TRF measurement showed no recognizable transient fluorescence signal, indicating that the photo-prepared ππ* state, which is strongly emissive as indicated by its large extinction coefficient, is extremely short lived, with a lifetime of less than 0.1 ps, beyond the time resolution of the measurement. This is in line with its very low Φf (∼8 × 10−5; Table 1), which when considering the value of extinction coefficient implies a ππ* state lifetime of <∼0.1 ps. This is indicative of the presence of highly effective nonradiative decay from the ππ* state to species that are optically “dark”, not seen in the fs-TRF.
In contrast, the measurement in CH3CN showed, promptly after the photo-excitation, an intense fluorescence from the LE (ππ*) state (with λf = ∼380 nm, 0.1 ps spectrum, Fig. 5a) that decays rapidly with ∼2.13 ps time constant according to the analysis of its intensity change (Fig. 5b). The decay is concurrent with the growth of the “red” fluorescence (λf = ∼535 nm) from the ICT state. This produces an isosbestic point at ∼530 nm, indicating a direct conversion from the LE to the ICT state (Fig. S7, ESI†). Note that the fluorescence of the ICT state is relatively very weak, in line with its charge transfer character. It can be seen from the inset of Fig. 5a that the ICT fluorescence after formation exhibits decay with the lifetime determined to be ∼690 ps (Fig. 5b and Table 1). With the availability of their lifetimes and taking into account the fluorescence quantum yield determined from the steady state measurement, the radiative rate (kf) of LE and ICT states can be estimated to be ∼5 × 108 and 6 × 106 s−1, respectively, in this solvent from the two molecules (Table 1).
The measurement in H2O resulted in transient fluorescence with a single emission band corresponding to the steady state spectrum after excitation, which exhibits a decay described by mono-exponential dynamics with a time constant of ∼1.12 ps (Fig. 5c and d). Note that the spectra obtained show no fluorescence from the ICT state, implying, under this condition, the lack of the ICT reaction that occurs in CH3CN.


Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. 
It can be seen from the fs-TA (Fig. 6a and b) that, in C6H12, promptly after the excitation, the molecule displayed a spectrum with the ESA at ∼340 nm. This absorption then increased slightly in a very rapid time scale (<∼0.25 ps) accompanied by the subtle decay of the intensity at ∼365 nm (Fig. 6a). Subsequent to this, the ∼340 nm ESA decayed and transformed into a spectrum featuring the ESA at ∼454 nm which is long living, displaying little decay in time afterwards (Fig. 6b and Fig. S8a, S9a, ESI†). This spectral evolution according to the global analysis of the associated TA time profiles (Fig. 6g) proceeds at a rate of ∼4.3 ps. Such a spectral change is concomitant with the observation of an isosbestic point at ∼355 nm, which indicates a precursor–successor relationship between the underlying excited states (Fig. 6b, g and Table 1). The ∼340 nm and ∼454 nm ESA, not shown in the fs-TRF, can be attributed, according to our (TD)DFT calculation (below), to the optically “dark” nOπ* state and the long living weakly emissive T13ππ* state, respectively. With this assignment, the initial ∼0.1 ps and the later ∼4.3 ps spectral transformation results, respectively, due to the internal conversion (IC) from the photo-populated ππ* to the closely lying lowest energy nOπ* as shown in the theoretical computation (below) and the ISC from the nOπ* to the T13ππ* state through highly efficient spin orbital coupling37 known to aromatic carbonyls.29,30,36,37a These processes make the major deactivation channels for the case in C6H12 (Scheme 3).
 Scheme 3  Major deactivation pathways proposed for DMAAP in (a) C6H12, (b) CH3CN and (c) H2O. 
In CH3CN, the fs-TA at time instantly after the excitation displays spectra containing the ESA at ∼350 nm due to the nOπ* state and a broad ESA across ∼450–700 nm along with the negative signal at ∼380 nm corresponding to the absorption and SE from the LE ππ* state (Fig. 6c). The observation of these spectral features indicates that the excited state population upon departing the FC region bifurcates, leading to concurrent involvement of both the LE and nOπ* states for the subsequent deactivation. It can be seen from the figure that the initial TA then evolved into a profile (e.g. 15 ps spectrum) with ESA peaking at ∼461 nm, which resembles the absorption of T1 seen in C6H12 (Fig. 6b) but with additional overlapped absorption at ∼500–520 nm wavelengths. Global analysis of the TA time profiles corresponding to an increase of intensities at ∼455 and 510 nm revealed a time constant of ∼4.9 ps and ∼2.1 ps, respectively (Fig. 6h and Table 1). Note that the ∼4.9 ps time constant coincides with the rate of the nOπ* to 3ππ* ISC while the ∼2.1 ps one, the time constant determined from fs-TRF, coincides with that of the conversion from the LE to the ICT state (Fig. 5a and b). The temporal evolution of TA in Fig. 6c is therefore a consequence of the joint action of the ISC and ICT reactions; the 15 ps spectrum can thus be attributed to the T1 state absorption at ∼461 nm and with the ∼500–520 nm feature due to absorption from the ICT state. The TA spectra in Fig. 6d show decay in the hundreds of picoseconds of the ICT state absorption, concomitant with the modest increase in the T1 absorption. This spectral change, indicating occurrence of a conversion from the ICT state to T1, was found to take place at a rate of ∼690 ps (Fig. S9b, ESI†), equivalent to the decay time of the ICT state derived from the measurement of fs-TRF (Fig. 5b and Table 1).
From Fig. 6e and f, it can be seen that TA in H2O is distinctive from those in both C6H12 and CH3CN. Promptly after the excitation, the TA spectrum (at ∼0.2 ps, Fig. 6e) shows a negative signal at ∼355 nm due to the ground state bleach (GSB) and the ESAs at ∼325 nm and at wavelengths from ∼500 to 700 nm along with the negative signal at ∼410 nm arising from the absorption and the SE of the ππ* LE state. Within the first several picoseconds, the ππ* LE state spectrum evolves into a profile featuring broad absorption ranging from ∼390 to 750 nm accompanied by a decrease in the intensity of the signal at the GSB region (e.g., 3.5 ps spectrum in Fig. 6e). As derived from the global analysis of the correlated TA time profiles (Fig. 6i and Fig. S9c, ESI†), this spectral evolution proceeds with a time constant of ∼1.12 ps (Fig. 6i), coinciding well with the TRF decay of the LE state as observed in Fig. 5c and d (Table 1). The newly formed spectrum decays with a lifetime of ∼2.47 ps, converting into a weak and long living ESA peaking at ∼435 nm concurrent with a massive recovery (by ∼76%) of the GSB at ∼355 nm (Fig. 6f and Table 1). The ∼2.47 ps process, not shown in the counterpart measurement of fs-TRF (Fig. 5c and d), must be mediated by a species of non-emissive character that, according to the result of the (TD)DFT calculation (below), is attributable to the nOπ* state with a peculiar structure. The late time ∼435 nm ESA can be assigned to the T1 state based on its long living nature (Fig. S8c, ESI†) and its resemblance to the T1 absorption observed in C6H12 and CH3CN (Fig. S8a and b, ESI†). The TA data altogether is indicative of nonradiative processes involving the decay of the initial LE ππ* state with 1.12 ps constant into the nOπ* state that is deactivated leading to ∼76% recovery of the S0 state by the IC and with the remaining population converting to the triplet manifold by the ISC (Scheme 3).

F. Density functional theory and time dependent density functional theoretical calculation of DMAAP and DMABA
In order to provide theoretical evidence for the interpretation of the experimental observation, we have conducted DFT and TDDFT calculations on DMABA at the B3LYP level using the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set with the solvent effect described by the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM), as well as considering the specific solvent effect by including H-bonding between solvent molecules with the amino nitrogen and the carbonyl oxygen for the case in water. Fig. 7 displays the optimized structures acquired for the S0 and the lowest energy excited state (S1) in the three solvents. The results on the property and molecular orbitals (MOs) dominating the low lying electronic transitions relevant to the optical absorption, fluorescence emission, and the nonradiative deactivation under varied conditions are shown in Fig. 8 and in Table 2.

 Fig. 8  Diagram of the molecular orbital calculated for the nOπ*, ππ* and ICT states of DMABA. 
From Fig. 7, it can be seen that the structures of S0 in the different solvents are very similar, featuring the nearly planar conformation in C6H12 and CH3CN while with the dimethylamino (DMA) group being subtly out of the ring plane (by ∼27°) in H2O due to the hydrogen bonding between water molecules and the nitrogen atom of the DMA group. It is worth noting that, as a result of the largely planar conformation and thus the conjugation between the ring π electrons and the lone pair electrons of the amino nitrogen, the C–Namino bond, with bond lengths of ∼1.37 Å in C6H12, ∼1.36 Å in CH3CN and ∼1.39 Å in H2O, possesses partial double bond character. On the other hand, in all these solvents, the C–Ccarbonyl and C–Ocarbonyl bonds, featuring bond lengths of ∼1.45 and ∼1.23 Å, respectively, have typically single and double bond character. In spite of this, the structure and electronic properties of the excited states are strongly altered in the three solvents (Table 2 and Fig. 7).
In C6H12, the ππ* transition, which is responsible for the experimentally observed optical transition, was calculated to occur at 315 nm for the absorption and at 328 nm for the fluorescence emission, reproducing very well the data from the steady state spectra (λa = 315 nm and λf = 334 nm) in Fig. 4. These transitions, as shown in Table 2, correspond to the second lowest energy state (S2) for both the absorption transition and the states accessible after the photo-excitation. The S1 in both the situations is due to the nearly optically forbidden nOπ* transition with the lone pair electrons originating from the carbonyl oxygen. This state, as illustrated in Fig. 7, possesses an optimal geometry featuring significantly increased C–Ocarbonyl bond length (by ∼0.09 Å) combined with shortening of the C–Ccarbonyl bond (by ∼0.06 Å) in comparison to the structure in S0. The presence of such an optical dark state at energy lower than the “bright” ππ* state explains the extremely short lifetime of the ππ* state (<∼0.1 ps, Fig. 6a) and the negligibly low fluorescence yield observed in this solvent (∼8 × 10−5). Besides, given the highly effective 1nOπ* to 3ππ* spin–orbit coupling present in most of the aromatic carbonyls,37 the participation of the nOπ* state also provides a rationale to the rapid ISC (∼4.27 ps time constant in DMAAP and 6.70 ps in DMABA) for the formation of the 3ππ* triplet as revealed in the fs-TA (Fig. 6b, Fig. S10b, ESI† and Scheme 3).
In CH3CN and H2O, the high solvent polarity stabilizes the ππ* state while destabilizing the nOπ* transition which is further disfavored by the hydrogen bonding interaction in H2O. As a consequence, with respect to that in C6H12, the energetic order of the two states is reversed with nOπ* being S2 lying at energy higher than ππ* (S1) at the FC region for excitation transition. This is consistent with the red shifts of absorption spectra observed in these solvents compared to that in C6H12 (Fig. 4).
For the case in CH3CN, according to our computation, the lowest energy state at the FC region is the optically allowed LE ππ* state with an oscillator strength (f) of ∼0.64 (Table 2). This is in line with the experimentally observed important participation of the LE state in generating the relatively strong fluorescence associated with a radiative rate of ∼3.7 × 108 s−1 (Table 1) and occurrence of the ICT reaction with the precursor being the LE state (Fig. 5a and Fig. S7, ESI†). More importantly, the optimization calculation identified that the S1 state features the ICT character, arising due to the transition with important contribution of the amino nitrogen lone pair electrons to the benzaldehyde moiety (i.e., nNπ* transition, Fig. 8 and Fig. S12, ESI†). This state was found to have a distinctive structure with the DMA group orientated perpendicular to the phenyl ring accompanied by a substantial lengthening of the C–Namino bond (by ∼0.07 Å) and increased quinoidal distortion of the ring moiety (Fig. 7) in comparison to those in the S0 state. Such a structure is characteristic of the prototype twisted ICT (TICT) state reported for the family of dual fluorescence molecules, including DMABN, DMABA, MDMABA and EHDMABA.9a,18,19,29,30 The large variation in the structure of the TICT state results in a massive degree of Stokes shift, corroborating the deeply red-shifted fluorescence observed in the experimental spectra (Fig. 4 and 5). It is noted that the calculated ICT state emission, despite falling in the range of the experimentally observed emission wavelengths (∼450–700 nm), was computed to occur at a wavelength (613 nm, Table 2) longer than the maximum intensity wavelength of the experimental fluorescence (569 nm, Table 1). This is probably a result owing to the method and the functional we used may overestimate the energy for the state with charge transfer excitation.19a,b The calculated orbitals involved in the transition for this state (Fig. 8 and Fig. S12, ESI†) are, however, very similar to those reported for the TICT state of closely related analogs.9,18,19a,b,29 Note that the electronic transition according to our calculation is devoid of oscillator strength (Table 2). This is, on the other hand, a well-recognized character of the TICT state, arising from its perpendicularly twisted structure and thereby the so-called orbital decoupling between the DMA and the aromatic ring systems.9,19a,b To this end, the experimentally observed fluorescence is rendered mainly due to thermal activation, brought about by the excited state population with the twisting angle departing from 90° to enable weakly allowed emission from the ICT state.9a–d In line with this, in our experiments we have observed a minute radiative rate (∼6 × 106 s−1, Table 1) for the ICT of this molecule. It is relevant at this point that previous studies have reported thermally activated fluorescence with the radiative rate increasing with temperature for the TICT state from a number of molecules including DMABA examined here.9a,18b Besides, our calculation also suggests that the LE ππ* to TICT conversion is largely a barrierless process, which agrees with the rapid rate (∼2.13 ps) of the ICT reaction as observed in the fs-TRF study (Fig. 5a and b).
In water, the result of calculations shows that the S1 state corresponds to the nOπ* transition and with the brightly emissive ππ* state being the energetically less stable S2 state. It is significant that the nOπ* state here (Fig. S12, ESI†) is remarkably different from that observed in C6H12 (Fig. 8); it occurs at a much lower energy (by ∼0.63 eV, Table 2) and displays a conformation with one of the N–Cmethyl bonds of the DMA group being highly distorted out of the ring plane (by ∼60°, Fig. 7). This is clearly caused by the involvement of the hydrogen bonding interaction, particularly at the site of the amino nitrogen. Note that the bond length of the Namino⋯H–O hydrogen bonding decreases by ∼0.2 Å from the S0 (2.11 Å) to the nOπ* (∼1.94 Å) state while that of Ocarbonyl⋯H–O hydrogen bonding elongates by ∼0.5 Å owing to the reduced charge density of the carbonyl oxygen rendered by the nOπ* transition. The enhanced Namino⋯H–O hydrogen bonding may, on the one hand, restrain twisting of the amino group, and eliminate the formation of the TICT state, explaining the lack of the ICT reaction and the single emission observed in the fluorescence measurement. On the other hand, the strengthening of the hydrogen bonding may stabilize strongly the nOπ* state, allowing it to serve as an effective trap to quench rapidly the photo-populated LE ππ* state, providing interpretation to the very brief lifetime (∼1.1 ps) of the ππ* state as revealed in the time-resolved measurement (Fig. 5c and d). Furthermore, the nOπ* state is at substantially low energy relative to S0, which according to the energy gap law37a may facilitate the nonradiative IC from this state to S0. Aside from this, the large structural change, especially those associated with the out-of-plane deformation of the DMA group (Fig. 7), could act as the driving force for the effectiveness of this decay process,21b allowing an efficient channel to compete against the intrinsic ISC for deactivating the nOπ* state. This, as a result, is accountable for the shorter lifetime of the nOπ* state in water (∼2.13 ps) than in C6H12 (∼4.27 ps) and, more importantly, is responsible for the highly efficient (∼76%) ground state recovery that is observed merely in this solvent (Fig. 6f), not for the cases in C6H12 and CH3CN.
Summary and remarks
The obtained results demonstrate distinctive deactivation mechanisms and the decisive role of solvents in governing the nature of electronic excitation, the dynamics and pathways of both the radiative and nonradiative processes for PABA, DMAAP and DMABA (Schemes 2 and 3). In the case of DMAAP and DMABA, the photo-prepared ππ* LE state, in C6H12, is deactivated exclusively through the two step LE (ππ*) → nOπ* → T1 (3ππ*) process with a rate of ∼0.1 and 4.3 ps, respectively. While in CH3CN, aside from the rapid nOπ* → T1 (3ππ*) channel, a fraction of the LE state population undergoes, with ∼2.1 ps time constant, the ICT reaction accompanied by structural changes to form the nNπ* nature TICT state which then decays with ∼690 ps lifetime to give also the T1 (3ππ*) state. On the other hand, these molecules in aqueous solution form a hydrogen-bonded complex with water molecules which after excitation are trapped by the hydrogen-bonded nOπ* state that is deactivated via two competing channels, i.e., the IC to the S0 and the ISC to the T1 (3ππ*) state. This proceeds with a rate of ∼2.5 ps and is dominated by the IC, accounting for ∼80% of the overall depopulation. Although analogous decay channels have been reported in C6H12 and CH3CN, the dynamics and deactivation cascade that we uncovered for these systems in water are unprecedented. Besides, our result on PABA shows that the molecule in aqueous solution (at pH 7) taking the A form performs after the excitation the extremely rapid protonation, yielding the N form LE (ππ*) state that takes a similar pathway to that in CH3CN, leading to ISC and the formation of T1 (3ππ*). This, to the best of our knowledge, provides the first direct observation of the deactivation processes for PABA in water.
In the context of their fundamental importance and the vast number of research studies on the excitation dynamics of D–A molecules, the results we acquired underscore the significance of the explicit nature of the A and D substituent moieties in dictating their solvent dependent nonradiative behaviors in terms of the ICT reaction and its competition with ISC and IC. For instance, the absence of the ICT reaction in PABA is clearly owing to the low electron donating capacity of the amino group in view of the fact that the emission from the ICT state has been observed for p-dimethylaminobenzoic acid that has the same acceptor but a stronger donating group of DMA.9a,10 Also, the ICT reaction rates that we measured for DMAAP (∼2.1 ps) and DMABA (∼1.8 ps) in CH3CN are faster than the rate (∼5 ps) for DMABN38 but slower than those for MDMABA (∼0.8 ps)36 and EHDMABA (∼0.7 ps) in the same solvent.30 Given that they all share the common donating group (DMA), this variation in the ICT rate results mainly from the change in the strength of the accepting moiety which is in the order –CN < –C(CH3)O < –CHO < –COOR (R = alkyl group).9a,15
More importantly, our result on DMAAP and DMABA demonstrates a prominent example for a pivotal role of the nOπ* state associated with the aldehyde (DMABA) and ketone oxygen (DMAAP), respectively, in altering pronouncedly the nonradiative channels in response to solvent polarity and more specifically the hydrogen binding capacity of the solvents. For instance, in the case of water, the presence and the respective strengthening and weakening of the solute–solvent hydrogen bonding at the site of amino nitrogen and carbonyl oxygen lead to state reversal, bringing the nOπ* state from being S2 at energy greater than the light absorbing LE in the FC region to become the lowest energy (S1) excited state after solvation and the structural relaxation of the excited state system (Scheme 3). The state reversal quenches the LE fluorescence and excludes the ICT reaction, and, in the meantime, the nOπ* state by gaining the distinctive nonplanar structure opens up in a very rapid timescale the otherwise inaccessible IC which operates as the leading channel, surpassing the ISC and formation of the long living triplet state as seen for the cases in CH3CN and C6H12 (Scheme 3). This rapid nOπ* mediated IC is reminiscent of the ultrafast nonradiative decay of nucleic bases, e.g., cytosine and its nucleosides and nucleotides where the nπ* state plays a significant role in allowing the IC to eliminate the excitation and contribute to their high degrees of photo-stability.
Note that this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that a highly efficient IC promoted by the nOπ* nature state through the two site hydrogen bonding has been observed for not only DMABA and DMAAP but also the A–D analogues in general. In this regard, our previous studies on DMABN,38 DEABN,39 MDMABA29,36 and EHDMABA30 and the work by others on closely related compounds such as fluorenone,40o-aminoacetophenone41 and their derivatives have also reported a solute–solvent hydrogen bonding induced IC that may proceed at a rate as high as ∼70 ps, dominating the overall deactivation involved. This IC is, however, brought about by a different pathway, occurring from the ICT state, and is facilitated by the enhanced hydrogen bonding between the solvent (water or alcohol) and the acceptor group which is more electron rich due to the ICT reaction. Such a difference, especially between MDMABA36 and EHDMABA30vs. DMABA and DMAAP, underscores that a subtle change in the substituent of the acceptor group, i.e., from the –COOR to –CHO or –C(CH3)O may alter profoundly the nonradiative mechanism.
In spite of the extensive investigation of A–D compounds in solvents of varied properties, those performed in aqueous solution are scarce. This is so because of the high polarity and the exceptionally strong hydrogen bonding capacity of water that when combined may lead to solvation unattainable under other conditions, and consequently unusual decay processes probably in a rapid timescale, difficult for both theoretical and experimental studies. Understanding the excitation dynamics in water is, however, a prerequisite for revealing the explicit role of water molecules in acting as not just spectators but also in participating and even controlling the pathway of solute deactivation. Given that an aqueous environment is close to physiological conditions and water is frequently contained in sunscreen products, knowledge of their excited state behaviors in water is essential also for application in biology relevant areas, including its efficacy as an active ingredient for sunscreen, which is dictated largely by nonradiative dynamics, especially those of IC and ISC.
On the one hand, it is known that the T13ππ* state of aromatic carbonyl (A–C) analogues is capable of sensitizing pyrimidine bases to form CPD photo-lesions that may lead to the onset of skin cancer. The T1 state, by virtue of its long lifetime, under ambient conditions, may also induce by energy transfer the production of singlet oxygen, a highly reactive species in a cellular environment that can cause oxidation stress manifested by, e.g., base damage, DNA strand breaks and destruction of cell components. The CPDs and singlet oxygen formations are precisely those reported responsible for the photo-damaging effect of PABA.6,7 In view of this, our observation of the significant triplet formation from PABA in the neutral aqueous solution provides evidence at the molecular level for its photo-carcinogenic effect. This molecule is thereby not feasible for use in sunscreens.
On the other hand, the rapid IC as we observed for DMABA and DMAAP in water allows the fast recovery of the ground state concurrent with the transformation of the electronic excitation energy into the benign vibrational energy that dissipates afterwards through thermalization into the surrounding solvent environment. The high efficiency of this process provides these molecules with a substantial degree of photo-stability and the capacity to protect against the various harmful effects that may arise from the triplet state given by the competing ISC. Regarding the growing current interest in the excited state dynamics of organic UV absorbers in sunscreens,4,21,42 the highly effective IC from the nOπ* state of aldehyde or ketone containing A–C compounds through strong hydrogen bonding with water makes an important addition to several recently reported photoprotective mechanisms achieved from nearly barrierless ultrafast nonradiative processes such as the trans–cis isomerization,25a,b,26b enol–keto tautomerization,22,23a,24a ESPT,22,25betc.
Furthermore, in view of the fact that DMABA and DMAAP display fluorescence emissions that are remarkably sensitive to solvent properties, derivatives of these compounds after being suitably tailored could be useful in the design of sensory materials to probe the polarity and hydrogen bonding character of the microenvironment.
Materials and methodology
4-Aminobenzoic acid was purchased from Sigma, and 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and 4-dimethylaminoacetophenone were from Aladdin. HPLC grade acetonitrile and cyclohexane were purchased from Duksan. Double deionized water was obtained from MILLIPORE (Milli-Q Synthesis). All the chemicals were used as received without further purification. Steady state UV-Visible absorption and fluorescence were measured using a Hitachi U-3900H spectrophotometer and a Jobin Yvon FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer, respectively. A comparative method was employed in the fluorescence quantum yield experiment using 5-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine in water (Φf = 5.6 × 10−4) or methyl-4-dimethylaminobenzoate in acetonitrile (Φf = 2.6 × 10−2) as the standard compound.36,43
The time-resolved measurements were mainly based on a commercial Ti:sapphire femtosecond regenerative amplifier laser system and a home-built ultrafast broadband TRF and TA spectrometer described in detail elsewhere.30 In brief, the 300 nm excitation pulse was generated using an optical regenerative amplifier with 800 nm fundamental output. The excitation pulse traveled a fixed optical path and focused on the sample. The residual part of the 800 nm fundamental output passed the optical delay line and was introduced as the gating pulse to drive the Kerr-gate device for acquiring a broadband transient fluorescence signal in the TRF or for the generation of the white light continuum (WLC) for the fs-TA experiment. The WLC, covering wavelengths from ∼300–750 nm, was produced by focusing the 800 nm beam onto a vertically shifting calcium fluoride plate for the experiment. On the other hand, benzene solution in a 1 mm path-length quartz cell was used as the Kerr medium for operating the Kerr gate device. Both the transient signals were collected and detected by a thermoelectric cooled or a liquid nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled device detector for the TA and TRF measurements respectively. In all measurements, the polarization angles between the excitation laser and the WLC in the TA or the polarization direction of the Kerr gate first polarizer in the TRF were kept at magic angles. The instrument response function (IRF) for the measurements is wavelength dependent, and it varied from ∼0.1 ps to 0.25 ps for wavelengths ranging from 750 to 300 nm in TA and it changes from ∼0.5 ps to 2 ps in the wavelength range of ∼700 to 300 nm in TRF. Spectral calibration was done to eliminate the wavelength-dependent time shifts caused by the group velocity dispersion in both TA and TRF measurements.
For all the time-resolved measurements, sample solution with a concentration of ∼0.7–3 mM was circulated through an ∼0.5 mm path-length calcium fluoride window-equipped flow cell for ensuring a fresh sample for each laser shot. To eliminate unwanted multi-photon or saturation effects, the energy of the pump laser beam was kept low with a typical laser pulse peak power of ∼2 GW cm−2. The sample solution examined by UV-Visible absorption before and after the time-resolved measurements revealed no degradation during time-resolved experiments. All measurements were performed at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.
For computation, the optimization of the S0 geometry was performed at the DFT level using the B3LYP functional without constraining structural symmetry. The geometry optimizations of the excited states and the absorption and emission spectra were conducted fully unconstrained by using the TDDFT method with the open shell B3LYP functional.18 For both the S0 and the excited states, the optimization calculation was performed in solvents considering both the nonspecific bulk solvent effect and the site-specific effect due to H-bond formation. The former was conducted for PABA in acetonitrile and water and DMABA in cyclohexane and acetonitrile with the solvent effect described by the non-equilibrium version of the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) algorithm.44 The site specific effect was assessed by calculation with the additional inclusion of two water molecules H-bonded to the carbonyl and dimethylamino moieties of DMABA. Apart from this, calculation at the TDDFT level was performed to obtain the vertical electronic transition energies and associated oscillator strengths at optimized structures for PABA. The TDDFT calculation was also performed to acquire molecular orbitals (MOs) involved in the electronic transition for evaluating the electronic nature of the transition for DMABA. All the calculations were done using the 6-311G++(d,p) basis set and employing the Gaussian 16 program suite.45
