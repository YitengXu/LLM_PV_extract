    , Accepted 16th November 2018First published on 23rd November 2018AbstractIt is very important to reveal the influence of different electric field directions on dye sensitizers. Thus, in this study, we investigated the electronic structures and optical properties of six designed aryl amine organic dye models under different electric fields using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). Moreover, the electronic structures and optical properties of these studied dyes with different electric field in tetrahydrofuran (THF) were also calculated. The key parameters of the short-circuit current density (Jsc), including light harvesting efficiency (LHE) and intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT), are discussed in detail. With dye T adsorbed on the anatase(101) surface, the periodic models with the exposed anatase(101) surface were employed to investigate the geometrical and electronic injection process. We expect that the present study will establish the relationship between the electric field and efficiency and provide a better understanding of the operation mechanism of DSSCs in detail.
1 Introduction
Traditional fossil energy is constantly being consumed, and the current energy system has a negative effect on the climate, environment and health.1,2 Thus, changing the current energy structure and developing sustainable clean energy have become the focus worldwide.3,4 Solar power, as a clean and renewable source to effectively convert solar energy into electric energy, is the most prospective method due to its unlimited supply, wide distribution and no transportation cost. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) stand out among the various photovoltaic devices due to their low cost, relatively high energy-conversion efficiency and simple production procedures.5–7 To date, the energy conversion efficiency of DSSC has been improved up to 14% via co-photosensitization with silyl-anchor ADEKA-1 and carboxy anchor organic dyes LEG4,8 thus promoting the further development of this type of photovoltaic device.
The operation principle of DSSCs can be described as follows: the photoabsorption of sensitizers9–12 results in electron injection from the excited dyes to the conduction band of the oxide semiconductor electrode.13 Then, the oxidized dye is reduced back to its neutral state by a redox mediator, which is usually an organic solvent containing a redox system.14,15 Finally, the remaining conducting electrons flow into the external circuit, and the redox mediator can be regenerated at the counter electrode.16 Consequently, an electric field is produced when DSSCs work.17–21 As the most important component in DSSCs, dye sensitizers play a crucial role in the electron injection process from the excited dye into the semiconductor band and the reduction process of the excited dye states by the redox mediator. The photovoltaic performance of dye sensitizers directly determines the overall efficiency of DSSCs. In all types of sensitizers, organic dyes have aroused much attention due to their outstanding advantages, such as high molar extinction coefficient, low cost and facile molecular design.22–24
In fact, the influence of the electric field on dyes during the operation of DSSCs is inevitable since dye sensitizers work under the condition of an electric field. After the dye sensitizer is adsorbed on the semiconductor electrode, the direction of the electric field acting on the dye sensitizer is arbitrary as the surface of the nanoparticle electrode is not perfectly smooth. Thus, the directional effect of the electric field is an important and interesting factor in this field. Moreover, the main direction of the electric field points from the counter electrode to the TiO2 surface in DSSCs.19 Here, some interesting questions arise such as whether the effect of the electric field in different directions on the properties of dyes is the same, and if not, which one will have the greatest impact on dye sensitizers, how does the direction of the electric field affect the photoelectric properties of dye sensitizers, and which dye adsorption configuration can yield the best performance under an electric field?
Thus, to answer these questions, we designed six organic dyes with the donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) structure and constructed a dye–TiO2 system containing two types of TiO2 models under different electric fields. The properties such as electronic structure, absorption spectrum and intra-molecular charge transfer of all the isolated dyes with and without different electric fields were systematically analyzed. In addition, to better understand the working principles of DSSCs, we also analyzed the interaction between the dye sensitizer and TiO2 model during the interfacial charge injection process under different electric fields.
2 Computational details
In this work, all calculations for the isolated dye and dye–TiO2 (Ti12O33H20 model) system were performed using the Gaussian09 suite of programs (Revision D.01) with a tight self-consistent field convergence threshold (10−8 a.u.).25 All ground state geometries of the isolated dye and dye–TiO2 (Ti12O33H20 model) system were carried out employing the B3LYP functional26 with the 6-31G(d)/LanL2DZ basis sets for C, N, O and H/Ti atoms. This level of theory for DFT calculation has been applied widely in many relevant works based on organic dyes.24 Based on these calculations, the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT)27,28 in conjunction with the B3LYP exchange correlation functional and 6-31G(d)/LanL2DZ basis set was used to explore the electronic properties of all the organic sensitizers. The solvent effects of tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent were considered using the polarizable continuum model (PCM).29,30 The Gaussian curves were used to simulate all UV/Vis spectra under full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.10 eV. The electric field with 10 × 10−4 a.u. strength (electric field strength, 1 a.u. = 5.142 × 109 V cm−1) parallel to the ±X, ±Y, and ±Z-axis were applied on the dye and dye–TiO2 system.
Furthermore, the calculation results of intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) were obtained using the B3LYP functional with the 6-31G(d) basis set. The excited-state densities calculated within the linear-response TD-DFT framework account for a vertical approximation. The electron transfer distance and the fraction of electron exchange related to the vertical transitions were computed with Multiwfn 3.0.5.31
To gain insight into the interactions of the dye–TiO2 system with and without an electric field, two models, the crystal model and cluster model, were used in this work. The crystal model was obtained by appropriately cutting from the anatase slab and exposing the majority (101) surface. Hydrogen saturators were used on oxygen atoms, which not only maintained the bond-orientation in the crystal, but also avoided the chaos of charge and multiplicity in the whole system. Finally, considering the computational cost and size, the Ti12O33H20(101) model was adopted as the surface of the TiO2 film in the current work. For the cluster model, a large (TiO2)38 cluster with the majority (101) surface exposed was constructed, which was comprised of two layers of Ti and O atoms. This model was large enough to neglect the molecular interactions between the periodic replicas and has been applied widely in many previous investigations.32,33 For optimization of the dye–TiO2 [(TiO2)38 model] system, the calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio simulation package (VASP 5.3).34,35 The projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials36,37 were employed to describe the electron–ion interactions. The exchange–correlation effects were treated by the Perdew and Wang (PW91) functional38 with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). A vacuum region of 30 Å was used to remove any interactions between slabs. The energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis sets was set as 400 eV. The Brillouin zones were sampled with the Monkhorst–Pack k-points of 1 × 1 × 1 for bulk calculation. A conjugated gradient algorithm with an energy criterion of 1 × 10−5 eV was used for atomic convergence, and the forces were guaranteed to be smaller than 0.02 eV Å−1 in all cases.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Molecular structure under different electric fields
Six organic dyes were designed based on the D–π–A framework in this study. All the organic dyes had the same π-spacer (vinyl group) and acceptor (cyanoacrylic acid) structure, and the only difference was the electron donor. The molecular structures of all the organic dyes and their corresponding names are shown in Fig. 1. Some selected geometrical parameters of these organic dyes under different electric fields are collected in Table S1 (ESI†).
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of all the aryl amine organic dyes (the red part of the donor is connected to the π-bridge). 
Actually, the electric field is produced due to the accumulation of electrons and the difference in the local carrier transport rate in the electrode of the DSSC. In this work, it is worth noting that all the electron donors have a circular plane structure, which is connected to the π-spacer. Therefore, one direction of the electric field is defined as the vector pointing from the donors to the acceptor according to the electronic moving direction, namely, the direction of the electric field is parallel to the X-axis. The circular planes of the electron donors are located on the X–Y plane. Then, the Z-axis is perpendicular to the plane. When the dye sensitizers are adsorbed on the electrode and the surface morphology of the electrode is flat, the dye sensitizers are mainly affected by the electric field in the X-direction, while the electric field in the Y- or Z-direction is easy to form when the surface morphology of the electrode is a nanoparticle.
As collected in Table S1 (ESI†), all the dihedral angles (φ1 and φ2) of the organic dyes without an electric field are approximately 180°. This means that the geometry of each studied organic dye is close to a plane, which is more favorable for the delocalization of electrons. When the electric field acts along the X-axis, the most important effect the change in the bond length (r1 and r2) and bond angle (θ1), which has little effect on the dihedral angle (φ1 and φ2). When the direction of the electric field acts along the Y-axis, it only has an effect on the bond angle (θ1) of the acceptor. Finally, electric fields perpendicular to the planar structure of the organic dye molecules were applied, which obviously changed the dihedral angle (φ1 and φ2), resulting in a great change in the planar structure of the organic dye molecules. As demonstrated above, the applied electric fields indeed impose little effect on the molecular configurations of the studied organic dyes.
3.2 Absorption spectra of isolated organic dyes under different electric fields
It is significant to examine the properties of the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) of all the organic dyes with and without electric field since they play a crucial role in determining the electronic excitations and transition characteristics. The energy of the selected FMOs and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gaps are given in Fig. 2. Furthermore, the important FMO compositions of the all organic dyes in THF solution are collected in Tables S2–S7 (ESI†).
 Fig. 2  Plot of the frontier molecular orbitals of all the dyes with different electric fields. 
There were eight frontier molecular orbitals (four occupied MOs and four unoccupied MOs) for all the organic dyes, as shown in Fig. 2. The distribution of the energy levels and the changing trend of the frontier molecular orbitals can be clearly observed from this figure. Based on the operating principle of a DSSC device, the occupied MOs should be dominated by the electron donating moiety, while the unoccupied MOs should mainly localize on the acceptor groups to create efficient charge separated states when exposed to sunlight. For the organic dyes without an electric field, from a composition point of view, the occupied molecular orbitals of these systems can be mainly labeled as π (D) orbitals in character, some of which are mixed with π (A) and π (π-spacer) character. The unoccupied molecular orbitals distributed over the entire dye molecule, which can be labeled as π* orbitals of the acceptor, are π-spacer and donor in character, but about half of the contribution comes from the cyanoacrylic acid. Hence, the electron of the organic dyes exhibits a distinct push–pull character, which can be transferred from the donor part to the acceptor part upon excitation.
In addition, from the energy level point of view, the energy levels of all the organic sensitizers should be matched with the energy of the conduction band of TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte. As an ideal dye sensitizer, the LUMO level should be higher than that of the conduction band of TiO2 (−4.00 eV vs. in vacuum),39 and the HOMO level should be lower than the redox potential of the electrolyte I−/I3− (−4.60 eV vs. in vacuum).40 This is not only conducive to the injection of electrons from the excited dyes into the conduction band of the TiO2 semiconductor electrode, but can also make the excited dye effectively obtain electrons from the redox electrolyte. It should be noted that the LUMO energy levels of all the organic dyes are higher than −4.0 eV, and their HOMO energy levels are lower than −4.6 eV. This means that these organic dyes are satisfactory in terms of energy level matching, which will favour charge injection from the excited sensitizer to the semiconductor.
When the electric fields were applied on the organic dye along the +X axis, an interesting phenomenon was observed, namely the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps of all of the studied systems were significantly reduced. Such a smaller HOMO–LUMO energy gap means a lower energy can make the dye excited, which can improve the light harvesting efficiency in the DSSC, especially to improve its ability to utilize long wavelength light. Compared to the no-field condition, it was found that the LUMO levels decrease and the HOMO levels increase. In this way, unnecessary energy loss can be reduced under the premise of energy level matching, thus making better utilization of solar light. It should be mentioned that the composition of the FMOs are essentially unchanged, and the same push–pull character can be obtained.
On the contrary, when the electric field was applied along the −X-axis, the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps increased obviously. Although the direction of the electric field had little effect on the orbital composition, the LUMO levels increased and the HOMO levels decreased for all the organic dyes. Hence, these properties are unfavorable for abundant absorption in the long-wavelength region. Different from the case when the electric field is applied to the ±X axis, when the electric field acts on the ±Y and ±Z axis, neither the orbital composition nor the energy level has much influence, which is similar to the case without an electric field.
The ground (Edye) and excited state (Edye*) oxidation potentials for all the dyes under different electric fields were computed and summarized in Table S8 (ESI†). The electronic injection free enthalpy, ΔGinject, and the dye regeneration free enthalpy, ΔGreg, were also obtained using the following equation:41ΔGinject = Edye* − ECB = Edye − E0–0 − ECBΔGreg = EI−/I3− − EdyeThe excited state oxidation potential, Edye*, should be at least 0.5 eV higher than ECB42 to obtain efficient solar energy-to-current conversion, and the ground state oxidation potential, Edye, should be lower than the redox potential of the electrolyte I−/I3− by at least 0.2 eV43 for an efficient dye regeneration process. As shown in Table S8 (ESI), without an electric field, all the dye systems have satisfactory values of ΔGinject and ΔGreg, which show their good electron injection ability and ability to be reduced by the electrolyte in the operation process. In addition, for the dyes with different electric fields, there is a general trend that the ΔGinject values become smaller when the electric field acts on the +X axis direction, and when the electric field is reversed, the opposite result is obtained. Although the value of ΔGinject became smaller, the dyes systems still exhibited an efficient electron injection process and reduced the unnecessary wastage of excited energy. When the electric field acted on the ±Y- and ±Z-axis, it was difficult to obtain a universal trend due to the unobvious changes in ΔGinject and ΔGreg. These changes will not have a great impact on the process of electron injection and dye reduction. Finally, the results of the dye P system were different from that of the other systems when the electric field acted on the X-axis. This is related to the different structures of the dyes and the properties of the electron donor.
To gain insight of the optical properties and electronic transition, the absorption spectra of all the organic dyes with different electric fields were simulated. The fitted Gaussian-type absorption curves based on the calculated absorption data in THF solution are shown in Fig. 3. The absorption results of all the organic dyes under different electric fields associated with their oscillator strengths and main excitation are summarized in Tables S9–S14 (ESI†).
 Fig. 3  Simulated absorption spectra of all the dye systems under different field strengths in THF solution. 
Generally, for the organic dyes without an electric field, there was a strong absorption peak in the visible range, which corresponds to the excitation of HOMO → LUMO. According to the analysis of the FOMs, this excitation can be ascribed to the charge transfer from the donors to the π-spacer and the cyanoacrylic acid group. This result indicates that the absorption properties of the organic dyes with the same D–π–A framework are similar, although their electron donor parts are different in this work. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3, there are also some weaker absorption peaks in the absorption spectra, which are mainly caused by the transition of other occupation orbitals to the LUMO, and the properties of these transitions are similar to that of the HOMO → LUMO transitions.
When the electric field acted on the +X-axis, the absorption spectra of all of the organic dyes exhibited an obvious red shift. This is consistent with the conclusion obtained from the analysis of the FOMs properties. For the absorption peaks, because the composition of the molecular orbitals involved in the transition remains basically unchanged, the properties of the transitions are still from the different donors to the π-spacer and the cyanoacrylic acid group. The main reason for the red shift is that the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps become smaller and the electrons can be excited by sunlight with a lower energy. In contrast, when the direction of the electric field is reversed, the absorption spectra of all the organic dyes are obviously blue shifted. These absorptions are not helpful for light harvesting efficiency, thereby affecting the performance of the DSSC. Finally, the absorption spectra of all the dye systems under the ±Y- and ±Z-axis electric field condition slightly changed. Regardless of the shape of the absorption curve, the position and strength of the absorption peaks are similar to that in the absence of an electric field.
3.3 Intramolecular charge transfer and reorganization energy
Intramolecular charge transfer occurs when light absorption induces an electronic shift from the donor part to the acceptor part. Hence, effective electron–hole separation of the organic dye sensitizer is crucial to obtain a high photocurrent conversion efficiency. Thus, to gain insight into the charge separation state of the dyes under different electric fields, several key parameters were calculated, namely the transferred charge (qct), the charge transferred distance (Dct), H and t, which are listed in Tables S15–S20 (ESI†). Furthermore, because the electron density difference plots gave a clear vision of the electron movement after photo-excitation, the relevant difference density plots of all the organic dyes are collected in Fig. S1–S6 (ESI†).
To illustrate how the different electric field directions affect the charge separation and electron transfer process in all the organic sensitizers, we analyzed the ICT property of the electronic transitions responsible for the absorption spectrum. According to the absorption results, the most important is the first excited state. Thus, we focused on the charge transfer properties of the first excited state. Firstly, the calculated t index value of all the organic dyes under any electric field condition was lower than 1.6 Å, which indicates that a correct description of the transition energy associated with a CT excitation can be obtained.44 Furthermore, the satisfactory result that the parameter H is larger than parameter DCT in all the dye systems was obtained, which can be used to characterize the extent of the orbital overlap between the regions of density depletion and increment and further quantify the through-space character associated with a computed CT excitation. As shown in Fig. S1–S6 (ESI†), the first excited state is efficient transitions for charge injection for all the studied dye systems since they combine desirable the qct and DCT values with a strong increase in electronic density in the cyanoacrylic acid group and decrease in donors. This can lead to quick electron injection by enhancing the electronic coupling between the sensitizer and the semiconductor surface. More importantly, we observed that the electric field has little effect on the intramolecular charge transfer properties of the dye molecules. Specifically, all the organic dye sensitizers still retain good intramolecular charge transfer properties under the condition of an electric field.
In general, favourable and balanced charge injection and transport ability of both electrons and holes are important for dye sensitizers, which are beneficial to obtain excellent performances in DSSC devices. The reorganization energy (λi) is a recommended factor to evaluate the balance properties between electron and hole transport for all organic dye systems. The charge transfer in organic dyes can be described as a process of uncorrelated hoping. The electron-transfer reaction from a charged species to an adjacent neutral unit can be explained by the Marcus theory45,46 and the rate of charge transfer can be approximately calculated as: (1)where, λ is the reorganization energy, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, HD–A is the electronic coupling matrix element between the donor and acceptor, and ΔG the energy difference between the initial (cation) and the final (neutral) states. Apparently, λ, HD–A, and ΔG are important factors to determine the value of ket. Moreover, HD–A is only related to the distance between the donor and the acceptor and has nothing to do with the nature of the medium. When an electric field is applied to organic dye sensitizers, the structures of the dye molecules change slightly; thus, HD–A has little effect on the value of ket. Therefore, λ and ΔG in the exponential item largely dominates the transfer rates. The reorganization energy λ and ΔG can be expressed as follows:47 λi = [E±0 − E±±] + [E0± − E0](2) ΔG = E++ − E0(3)where, E±0 is the energy of the cation or anion calculated with the optimized structure of the neutral molecule, E±± is the energy of the cation or anion calculated with the optimized cation or anion structure, E0± is the energy of the neutral molecule calculated at the cationic or anionic state, and E0 is the energy of the neutral molecule at ground state.
According to eqn (1), a smaller λ value and larger ΔG will generate a fast charge transport process. The calculated λelectron, λhole and ΔG of all the organic dyes with and without an electric field are also listed in Table 1. Overall, the organic dyes under an electric field along the +X-axis direction show smaller reorganization energies of λelectron and λhole as well as larger ΔG values, indicating that the charge transport is faster than that of the others. When the electric field acts on the −X-axis, these organic dye systems exhibit an inferior charge transfer performance due to their larger λelectron and λhole values and smaller ΔG value. In addition, compared with the field-free case, the recombination energy of λelectron and λhole and the ΔG value hardly change for the organic dyes under electric fields along the ±Y- and ±Z-axis directions. Therefore, it is concluded that the electric fields along the ±Y- and ±Z-axis have little effect on the charge-transfer properties of these dye systems.

3.4 The organic dye sensitizers on the TiO2 surface system
Sunlight is absorbed by the dye sensitizer, which is anchored to the electrode surface of semiconducting TiO2 nanocrystals in DSSCs. Then, a charge separation process takes place at the interface through photo-induced electron injection from the excited sensitizer into the conduction band of the TiO2 electrode. The performance of DSSCs strongly depends on their light harvesting ability, the relative energy levels of the sensitizer, and the dynamics of te electron injection processes at the interface between the sensitizer and TiO2 electrode. Hence, it is crucial to understand the interaction between the dye molecules and TiO2 semiconductor electrode in the presence of an electric field for high performance DSSCs.

3.4.1 Absorption spectrum light harvesting efficiency of organic T dye on the Ti12O33H20(101) model. 
As photoelectric conversion devices, obviously the efficiency of DSSCs will be higher if dye sensitizers absorb more visible light and there is better orbital coupling between the sensitizers and TiO2 electrode. The light absorption capacity of the dye–TiO2 system determines the overall efficiency of DSSCs. Hence, it is meaningful to investigate the absorption properties of dye sensitizers by considering proper dye-adsorbed TiO2 model systems. In this work, we constructed a model containing a TiO2 substrate model and T dye sensitizer (see Fig. 4a) to elucidate how the electric field direction affects the absorption spectrum of the dye–TiO2 system.
 Fig. 4  (a) Representative geometry of dye T linked to the TiO2 model after optimization. (b) Simulated absorption spectra of the dye T–TiO2 system under different fields in THF solution. 
To reduce the computational workload, we only selected the organic dye T as the adsorption sensitizer. Moreover, the TiO2 model was vital for rationality and accuracy in our simulation. In general, the anatase nano-TiO2 form is more photo-reactive and photo-catalytic than of the rutile form. Taking the computational cost and size into account, the anatase Ti12O33H20(101) model from the crystal structures was finally adopted as the TiO2 surface in the current work. Moreover, the density of states (DOS) is presented in Fig. S7 (ESI†).
The partial frontier molecular orbital compositions are listed in Table S21 (ESI†) to illustrate the electronic structure of the Ti12O33H20 model. These characteristics are in accordance with the knowledge of the TiO2 semiconductor material. The LUMO energy level of the Ti12O33H20 model (located at −4.336 eV) accords well with the conduction band edge position of −4.3 eV for anatase, indicating that the calculated electronic structure and related results of the Ti12O33H20 model are reliable and accurate for describing the conduction band properties of the semiconductor. Finally, the connection type between the organic dye T and the TiO2(101) model was investigated. The bidentate bridging type is stable,48,49 which is the most important connection type determining the interaction strength and absorption efficiency of these studied systems.
The simulated absorption spectra of the T–TiO2 model system with different electric fields are plotted in Fig. 4b. Furthermore, the orbital compositions of the T–TiO2 systems are summarized in Table S22 (ESI†). For each system only the dominant excitations in the absorption process are listed in Table S23 (ESI†). For the field free system, there is only one absorption peak in the visible range. The excitations of HOMO → L+21 (63%) and HOMO → L+22 (27%) are responsible for the absorption peak at 493 nm. As shown in Table S22 (ESI†), the HOMO is mainly formed by the π orbital of the T dye, whereas L+21 and L+22 are almost delocalized over the d orbital of the Ti atoms. Thus, the absorption peak can be assigned to the charge-transition from the π orbital of the T dye to the d orbital of the Ti atoms. This fact shows satisfactory electronic coupling between the T dye and the TiO2 semiconductor. When absorption occurred, the electrons were stimulated and entered the TiO2 electrode directly, and ultrafast excited-state electron injection was the primary mode of charge transfer from the T dye to the TiO2 electrode.
However, the absorption of the T–TiO2 system changed obviously when the electric field acted on the X-axis together with obvious changes in the molar absorption coefficient and a shift in the absorption range. It is worth noting that there are two absorption peaks for the T–TiO2 system in the visible region in the presence of an electric field on the +X-axis, and the spectrum is obviously red-shifted. The strongest absorption occurs at 511 nm, and the excitation responsible for it originates from the same HOMO but terminates from different virtual orbitals of L+30 (69%) and L+31 (28%). The main transition process is still the charge transfer from the dye T to the TiO2 semiconductor, and thus this transition is favourable for electron injection. In addition, the shoulder peak at 566 nm, which is the excitation of HOMO → L+26, can be assigned from the π orbital of the T dye to the d orbital of the Ti atoms. The molar absorption coefficient of the T–TiO2 system with an electric field along the +X-axis is smaller than that of the field-free system, but the enhancement of the absorption in the long-wavelength range is more beneficial to improving the photo-electric conversion efficiency. However, the absorption of the T–TiO2 system with an electric field along the −X-axis is clearly shifted to shorter wavelengths relative to that of the off-field condition. For the strongest peak at 454 nm, the three excitation transition processes (in Table S23, ESI†) lead to this absorption, which can be assigned as the electron transfer from the contribution of π orbitals of the T dye to the d orbitals of the Ti atoms and to the π* orbitals of the T dye itself. In these electron transition processes, the contribution of the transition of the organic dye is increased, which leads to an indirect and slower injection process. Moreover, the imposed electric fields along the ±Y- and ±Z-axis directions show no obvious effect on the absorption of the T–TiO2 system. According to the calculations, the absorption spectra of the T dye on the TiO2 model with electric fields along the +Y, −Y, +Z, and −Z axes present the strongest absorption peak at 501, 493, 494, and 502 nm, respectively. The properties of the electron transition are similar to the T–TiO2 system without an electric field.
Theoretically, the dye sensitizer absorbs a photon from the sunlight and produces an electric current. Namely, the more photons captured, the more electrons to be excited. To analyse light harvesting efficiency (LHE) of the T–TiO2 system under different electric field conditions, the capability of the T–TiO2 system to capture light was also studied in this work. Herein, a numerically quantitative method was adopted to calculate the sunlight harvesting and utilization of the organic T–TiO2 system. Based on a simple and clear equation, the ηLHE(λ) at s given wavelength, λ, can be calculated as follows:50,51 ηLHE(λ) = 1 − 10−Γσ(λ)(4)where, Γ is the surface loading of sensitizer (mol cm−2) linked onto the TiO2 semiconductor electrode, which is determined by the molecular size of the dye, the adsorption angle, and the assumption of monolayer adsorption. In current work, Γ was set to 1.17 × 10−7 mol cm−2. σ(λ) is the molecular absorption cross-section (cm2 mol−1), which is related to the molar absorption coefficient (ε(λ)) and can be expressed as:52 σ(λ) = 1000 × ε(λ)(5)The ηLHE(λ) curves for the T–TiO2 system under different electric fields are shown in Fig. 5. It is apparent that the T–TiO2 system with an electric field the along +X-axis has wider coverage and higher ηLHE(λ) at 600–750 nm. On the contrary, when the direction of electric field is reversed, the ηLHE(λ) of the T–TiO2 system becomes worse. In addition, when the electric fields were applied along the Y and Z axes, the light absorption capacity of the T–TiO2 system hardly changed.

LHE(λ) curves for the dye T–TiO2 system. 
However, it is insignificant to obtain only ηLHE(λ) since the photon number changes as the wavelength varies. Thus, we should consider another parameter, Jph, which is related to the integral photon flux density (Φ(λ)) in the whole absorption area. Φ(λ) is defined as the number of photons per second per unit area and per unit wavelength, which can be evaluated using the following equation: (6)The total photon number per second per unit area within the whole spectrum area can be calculated using the following equation: (7)In eqn (6) and (7), P(λ) is the spectral power density and E is the energy of the photon at the wavelength of light (λ), which can be obtained from the Planck–Einstein relation: (8)where, h is Planck's constant, 6.626 × 10−34 J s, and c is the speed of light, 3.0 × 108 m s−1. Next, the most important thing is to get an accurate functional expression of the spectral power density P(λ). However, the determination of solar irradiance is so complicated that it cannot be described by a simple mathematical function. With the spectral irradiance of the sun being approximated by the blackbody emission theory at a temperature of about 5778 K,53 the power density at a given wavelength can be rewritten as: (9)where, R is the radius of the sun, 0.695 × 109 m; D is the distance from the sun to the earth, 1.496 × 1011 m; k is the Boltzmann constant 1.38 × 10−23 J K−1; and T is the temperature of the blackbody. Here, T was set to 5778 K. Combining the absorption properties and the light harvesting efficiency of the dye, the exact part of photon flux density (Φ(λ) generated by the dye sensitizer per second per unit area at the given wavelength (λ)) can be rewritten as: (10)Finally, the maximal photon generated current (Jph) can be expressed as: (11)where, q is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10−19 C). The Jph for the T–TiO2 system under different electric fields was obtained and presented in Table 2. It is noted that the Jph (18.76 mA cm−2) generated by the T–TiO2 system under an electric field along the +X-axis is much larger than that of the other cases, which will improve the light harvesting ability of the dye and further produce more electrons to inject into the TiO2 semiconductor. Compared with the field-free condition, it is obvious that the values of Jph for the T–TiO2 system under electric fields along the ±Y and ±Z axes are almost the same. The worst Jph (9.14 mA cm−2), only half the maximum, appeared when an electric field was imposed along the −X axis on the T–TiO2 system.

3.4.2 Geometries structure and electron injection dynamics of organic T dye on the (TiO2)38 model. 
In addition to the above light harvesting ability, simulation of the interfacial electron transfer (IET)54,55 from the dye to the TiO2 semiconductor is of great importance for understanding the organic dye performance under different electric field conditions. Furthermore, the IET rate is affected by electronic coupling between the dye excited states and TiO2 conduction band. Thus, to comprehensively understand the interface interaction, we analysed the geometrical structures, electronic structures, and IET processes at the T–TiO2 interface. Due to the suitable band gap, the (TiO2)38 cluster was used to model the TiO2 surface, which provided a good balance between computational cost and actual situation. In this part, the adsorption configurations of the dye T on the (TiO2)38 cluster was the same as discussed above, and the direction of the electric field applied to the dye was set to 5.142 × 10−2 V Å−1. The optimized geometry of the organic T dye on the (TiO2)38 model is shown in Fig. 6. Some selected bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles are presented in Table S24 (ESI†).
 Fig. 6  Optimized geometry and numbering atoms of organic T dye on the (TiO2)38 model. 
Compared to the off-field condition, the partial bond lengths of the adsorbed group are slightly shortened, and the bond angles of the adsorbed group are slightly changed. The biggest change occurred for the dihedral angle. When the electric field acted on the X-axis, the overall structure of the dye molecule was closer to the plane type. Moreover, the same situation occurred when the electric field acted along the Y-axis, but the effect of the electric field on the structure was more pronounced. The bond angle and dihedral angle of the adsorption group changed, and the plane form of the dye molecule was more obvious. When the electric field acted on the +Z axis, the whole structure of the T–TiO2 system hardly changed. However, the bond angle and dihedral angle of the adsorption group changed greatly when the direction of the electric field was reversed (−Z-axis). Specifically, the influence of an electric field on the structure of the T–TiO2 system cannot be ignored, and the change in structure will affect the interaction between the dye T molecule and (TiO2)38 model.
As the dye molecules eventually inject their electrons into the semiconductor through the anchoring group, we only needed to calculate the change in charge of the O atoms directly adsorbed on the semiconductor. Based on the above stable configurations, the average Bader atomic charges for the cyanoacrylic acid group and a bare molecule are listed in Table 3. When there was no electric field, the stronger interaction between the dye T and the (TiO2)38 model resulted in a noticeable charge transfer from the dye to the (TiO2)38 model, and the total charge of the cyanoacrylic acid group was −0.851 e. In addition, the average charge on the oxygen atoms (∼−1.800 e) connected to the Ti atom was obviously reduced when the molecule was anchored to the surface and the average charge of the Ti atoms in the (TiO2)38 model was 2.615 and 2.630 e when the dye T was adsorbed. Compared with the isolated dye, the electrons of the O atoms in the adsorbed group increased, which means that the dye T will inject electrons through these oxygen atoms. At the same time, compared with the clean TiO2 model, the charge on the adsorbed Ti atom was slightly reduced.

When the electric field acted along the X-axis, the total charges of the cyanoacrylic acid group was −0.886 e and −0.984 e (+X and −X axes respectively), which indicates that the charge on the cyanoacrylic acid group increases under the action of the electric field. This facilitates the charge transfer from the dyes to the (TiO2)38 model. In addition, the electric field in these directions have little effect on the charge of the titanium atom on the (TiO2)38 model. When the electric field acted along the Y-axis, the total charges of the cyanoacrylic acid group decreased, and the effect of the electric field in both ±Y directions was also different. The charge on the cyanoacrylic acid group was −0.861 e and −0.581 e (+Y and −Y axis respectively). This is because the structure of dye T is not symmetrical. Finally, because the overall configuration of the dye T is not planar, the charge on the adsorption group exhibits opposite situations when the electric field acted on the Z-axis. When the electric field acted along the +Z axis, the charge of the adsorption group increased to −0.901 e, but the charge of the adsorption group decreased to −0.738 e along the −Z-axis. Therefore, these results indicate that the electric field in different directions has an obvious effect on the charge distribution of the dye–TiO2 system.
To investigate the electron injection dynamic processes under different electric field conditions, the survival probability for all the T–TiO2 systems are shown in Fig. 7. A gradually delocalized electron was injected into the TiO2 model under different electric fields within the 2000 fs time-scale. The electron injection process can be described as: initially, the charge density is mainly populated in the dye molecule. Then it spreads to the TiO2 model. Finally, the initial population in the sensitizer decays to some extent to reach an equilibrium state. As can be seen from Fig. 7, the survival probability results are clearly affected by the direction of the different electric fields. In the case of dye T without an electric field, the electron was rapidly injected. The survival probability in the dye-sensitized TiO2 decayed to about 20% at ∼500 fs. Then, the electron injection rate slowed down and gradually approached the equilibrium state, which evolved into stable states after ∼750 fs (survival probability is ∼10%). When the electric field acted on the ±X-axis, compared with the case without an electric field, the electron injection rate obviously improved, both at the injection time and in the final stable state of electron injection. Although the electron injection rate slowed in the time range of 210 to 1300 fs, the injection rate of the dye–TiO2 systems with an X-axis electric field was fast in the other time periods. Also, it is worth noting that when the electric field acted along the −X-axis, it takes only 320 fs to reach the state of survival probability of ∼10%. After 2000 fs, the survival probability was ∼5%, which means that the electron injection process is more thorough. Moreover, when the electric field acted on the +Y-axis, the electron injection rate became slower, and when the electric field was on the −Y-axis, the electron injection rate was obviously accelerated. Finally, when the electric field acted on the Z-axis, the electron injection rate became very slow in both directions, which indicates that the electric field acting in these directions significantly hinders the electron injection process.

4 Conclusions
In this work, we presented a systematic theoretical study on the influence of different electric fields on DSSCs for six aryl amine organic dyes. The key properties such as the geometric and electronic structures, optical properties, and intra-molecular charge transfer as well as electron injection processes of these dyes with different electric fields were discussed explicitly. Based on the calculated results, the following conclusions were drawn.
We believe that the primary role of the electric field in a real working solar cell is to change the inner electric potential energy of the solar cell. The electric field can work on the electron transfer of the dye sensitizer, where positive work is done when the electric fields are applied along the +X-axis. It can produce favourable properties of the LHE(λ) and appropriate ΔGinject, which will generate a large short-circuit current density (Jsc). Meanwhile, the application of an electric field along the +X-axis in dyes can increase the number of photoelectrons in the TiO2 conduction band and increase the open-circuit photo-voltage (Voc), which allows the maximum DSSC efficiency to be achieved. The overall efficiency is reduced when the electric field acts on the −X-axis, which is because the electric field does negative work on the electron transfer. When the electric field is applied along the other directions (±Y-, and ±Z-axis), it has little effect on the Jsc and Voc because the electric field does zero work on the electron transfer. However, considering the electron injection process, the result of the electric field acting on the Z-axis is not desirable.
Furthermore, we found that when the direction of electron transfer is the same as that of the electric field, the DSSCs will have the best performance. Thus, in the design of DSSCs with high power conversion efficiency, we suggest that dye molecules be adsorbed vertically on the TiO2 electrode. At the same time, if the dye molecules are adsorbed in a regular D–π–A direction, namely the dye molecules possess a linear structure, the efficiency of the DSSCs will be better.
Finally, the results are helpful to establish the relationship between the electric field and DSSC efficiency to provide useful information for designing new dye sensitizers and/or electrode surface morphologies and deepen the understanding of the operation mechanism of DSSCs in detail.
