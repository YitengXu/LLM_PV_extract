    , Accepted 16th October 2016First published on 17th October 2016AbstractTo reduce the greenhouse effects due to the massive emission of CO2, efficient reduction of carbon footprint and effective utilization of CO2 have been a crucial research field worldwide in the past few decades. Novel catalysts efficiently facilitating the conversion of CO2 into target chemicals are highly desirable. Herein, we developed a new cathode with in situ exsolved Co–Fe alloy nanoparticles embedded in an active (Pr0.4Sr0.6)3(Fe0.85Mo0.15)2O7 (PSFM) double-layered perovskite backbone (Co–Fe–PSFM), which acts as a more stable and efficient catalyst to promote CO2 electrolysis in a high temperature solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) compared to the Pr0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Mo0.1O3−δ (PSCFM) cubic perovskite. This newly developed material shows superb redox reversibility between reduction and re-oxidation cycles. Additionally, a remarkable current density of 1.01 A cm−2 of the SOEC with the Co–Fe–PSFM cathode in conjunction with an impressive polarization area-specific resistance (ASR) as low as 0.455 Ω cm2 of the cathode was achieved at 1.6 V and 850 °C. In particular, a high value of Faraday efficiency (∼93%) was achieved at 0.8 V (vs. OCV) and 850 °C. More importantly, the cell with the new cathode shows no observable degradation and carbon formation at 850 °C over a period of 100 h at a constant applied potential. The improved oxygen vacancies resulted from the exsolving process, and phase change (cubic perovskite to double-layered perovskite), together with the exsolved Co–Fe alloy nanoparticles, contributed to the improved catalytic activity, high Faraday efficiency, good stability, and excellent coking resistance for CO2 electrolysis. In light of the properties above, double-layered PSFM socketed with Co–Fe alloy nanoparticles is an attractive ceramic material for intermediate/high temperature applications, especially for CO2 electrolysis.
1. Introduction
The increasing utilization of fossil fuels has brought about a record-breaking level of atmospheric CO2, which adversely and uncontrollably impacts the global climate. Global warming, which is attributed to the significantly rising level of atmospheric CO2, has become a serious environmental concern.1 To attenuate the greenhouse effects, efficient technologies to significantly reduce CO2 emission and effectively utilize CO2 have been the focus of recent research. Some of the traditional CO2 conversion methods are infeasible for large-scale industrial implementation, mainly because of their high energy consumption and/or low conversion efficiency.2,3 Therefore, a highly selective and energy-efficient CO2 conversion method is a great stride towards effective CO2 capturing and utilization. Recently, solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) have been considered to be advantageous for the efficient electrochemical conversion of CO2 into CO because they utilize renewable energy, such as wind power and solar energy. Conventionally, highly active anode materials employed in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are preferentially considered as the potential cathodes in SOECs.4,5 However, it is not always feasible to use the SOFC anode materials directly for SOECs. For example, the Ni/YSZ composite anode, an active catalyst for H2 oxidation in SOFCs, suffers from the inherent redox instability, because Ni is oxidized to NiO when exposed to an oxidizing flow, which leads to loss of the electrical conductivity.6 Additionally, carbon accumulation lowers the cell performance and even causes delamination of the cathode from the electrolyte.7 Therefore, developing new catalysts for CO2 electrolysis in high temperature SOECs capable of efficient conversion of CO2 to CO is highly desirable.
Cathode materials based on doped lanthanum chromates and lanthanum ferrites have been widely studied for direct CO2 electrolysis, such as La(Sr)Fe(Mn),8,9 La(Sr)Cr(Mn),10–13 La(Sr)Cr(Fe)14 and Ce15 or Ti16 doped La(Sr)Cr(Fe). These cathode materials have been demonstrated to be potential catalysts for CO2 electrolysis because of their good stability in a carbon-abundant environment. However, insufficient catalytic activity and low electrical conductivity consequently lead to poor electrochemical performances. Recently, a double-layered perovskite, PrBaMn2O5+δ, was found to enhance the electrocatalytic activity for CO2 electrolysis. Since it contains a multivalent transition metal cation (Mn), which can provide higher electrical conductivity and maintain a larger content of oxygen vacancy than perovskite-type materials, it contributes faster oxygen ion diffusion.17 On one hand, oxygen vacancies that act as host sites to accommodate the non-polar CO2 could effectively facilitate CO2 chemical adsorption at high temperature.18 On the other hand, the chemically adsorbed CO2 can be activated on oxygen vacancy sites, which favors CO2 electrolysis.
It is well-known that the transition metal cations on the B-site are responsible for the catalytic activity and electron transfer.19 However, the larger A-site cations in the lattice (both cubic perovskite and double-layered perovskite) are energetically favorable to be terminated at the AO surface,20,21 and A-sites effectively block B-sites from coming into contact with CO2 because less B-sites are exposed to the free surface.19 Consequently, this contributes to poor electrochemical performance. To tackle this issue, we proposed to exsolve metal/bimetal nanoparticles in situ on the surface of the host lattice because the exsolved ions from the double-layered perovskite lattice promote the diffusion of reducible ions to the surface, thus facilitating the growth of the metal/bimetal nanoparticles. The in situ exsolved metal/bimetal nanoparticles improve both the electronic conductivity and the catalytic activity. The Co–Fe bi-metallic alloy, acting as an excellent electrochemical catalyst, has been widely studied as an anode material in SOFCs, since both Co and Fe have been considered as effective alloying elements to improve the electrochemical performance in SOFCs.22–24 Co possesses almost the same catalytic activity as Ni and has less possibility towards carbon formation. Another well-studied element Fe also shows excellent coking resistance.25 According to the binary Co–Fe phase diagram,26 a complete solid solution in the form of a Co–Fe alloy is obtainable at the temperature range of 730–985 °C, and upon cooling to below 730 °C an ordering reaction occurs. Such ordering reactions could modify the catalytic activity of the alloy.23 More importantly, electrical conductivity and stability can be largely enhanced in a wide range of oxygen partial pressures by the introduction of Mo at intermediate temperature.27 Besides, Mo-doping can strongly affect the iron oxidation states and the simultaneous formation of oxygen defects in the perovskite which are responsible for the catalytic activity.28
Herein, we developed a (Pr0.4Sr0.6)3(Fe0.85Mo0.15)2O7 (PSFM) double-layered perovskite with in situ exsolved Co–Fe alloy nanoparticles (Co–Fe–PSFM) for CO2 electrolysis by reducing Pr0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Mo0.1O3−δ (PSCFM) in a 5% H2/N2 flow at 850 °C. Both PSCFM and Co–Fe–PSFM were fabricated as the cathodes in an yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte supported SOEC. The catalytic activities and Faraday efficiencies of the PSCFM and Co–Fe–PSFM for CO2 electrolysis at 850 °C were studied. The redox stability and coking resistance of the Co–Fe–PSFM were also evaluated.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Characterizations of synthesized materials
Polycrystalline perovskite powders of PSCFM were prepared using a modified sol–gel method, as described elsewhere.29 The as-prepared PSCFM showed a pure single phase without any impurities, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in Fig. 1A(a). It has a cubic structure [space group: Pmm (221)] with a lattice constant of a = b = c = 3.8762 Å. Comparing the XRD patterns of PSFM after reduction in a H2 flow for 2 h with those of PSCFM (Fig. 1A(b)), it is found that PSFM possesses a tetragonal structure with lattice parameters of a = b = 3.853 Å, c = 20.149 Å, and a space group of I4/mmm (139). The splitting of the diffraction peaks observed in Fig. 1A(b) indicates a different phase structure of PSFM. The two weak peaks, marked with “Δ”, correspond to the crystal faces of (110) and (200) of the Co–Fe alloy, respectively.30 The lattice space between the two parallel planes derived from the local magnification region of the Co–Fe alloy nanoparticles in Fig. 1B is 0.212 nm, as shown in Fig. 1C. It is quite close to the calculated value of 0.202 nm at (1 1 0) planes of the Co–Fe alloy in the space group of [Pmm (221)]. This in turn confirms that Co in conjunction with Fe could be in situ exsolved in the form of an alloy. The differences in structure and lattice parameters of the two materials support the fact that the cubic PSCFM was phase-changed to double-layered PSFM during the exsolving process under a reducing flow.30Fig. 2A and B show the microstructures of the as-obtained porous PSCFM and Co–Fe–PSFM, respectively. Apparently, the PSCFM particles with an average diameter of ∼300 nm are well interconnected (Fig. 2A). This ensures high mechanical strength and fast gas diffusivity. After its exposure to H2 at 900 °C for 2 h, it is clearly seen that the morphology of the material differs from that of the one sintered in air (Fig. 2A), some nanoparticles with an average diameter of ∼50 nm exsolved and socketed on the double-layered PSFM backbone, as shown in Fig. 2B. The morphologies and compositions of Co–Fe–PSFM were also characterized by low-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (with the results shown in Fig. 2C and D). The low-resolution TEM image of Co–Fe–PSFM revealed that the surface of the PSFM backbone was embedded with some nanoparticles (Fig. 2C). A selected nanoparticle was magnified with high resolution, which further confirmed that the in situ exsolved particle was well socketed on the host perovskite (Fig. 2D). This phenomenon was verified by the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings (Fig. 2D and S1†) and EDS spectra (Fig. 2E). The EDS spectrum confirmed the presence of Pr, Sr, Co, Fe and Mo in Co–Fe–PSFM, as shown in Fig. 2E. It can be seen in Fig. 2D and S1† that both Co (magenta) and Fe (red) elements were distributed uniformly in the exsolved nanoparticles. This is consistent with the XRD result, indicating that only Co and Fe nanoparticles can be exsolved in situ from the PSFM backbone under the reducing conditions. In contrast, the signals of elemental distributions of Pr (dark cyan), Sr (green) and Mo (yellow) were infinitesimal and thus negligible. On the basis of the above analysis, we concluded that the Co–Fe exsolving process on the surface of the PSFM backbone and the phase change occurred simultaneously under the reducing flow at elevated temperature.

Besides the crystallographic structure and morphology, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted to analyze the chemical valence states of Co and Fe on the surface as well as oxygen (adsorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen), as shown in Fig. 3A–D. The adventitious carbon (C 1s) at the binding energy (BE) of 284.6 eV is regarded as the reference. The XPS survey spectra shown in Fig. 3A and S2A† confirmed the presence of Pr, Sr, Co, Fe and Mo in both PSCFM and Co–Fe–PSFM powders, respectively. The spectra of Co and Fe were analyzed in Fig. 3B and C. It can be seen that the peaks of Co0 and Fe0 are obviously present, whereas in Fig. S2B and C,† no noticeable peaks for Co0 and Fe0 were identified. Two weak peaks of Co0, located at 777.8 (Co 2p3/2) and 792.5 eV (Co 2p1/2),31 for the Co–Fe–PSFM perovskite unambiguously verified that Co existed after the exsolving reaction. Also, as compared to the Fe 2p spectra in Fig. S2C,† the splitting sub-peaks of Fe 2p spectra are located at 706.2 (Fe 2p3/2)32 and 719.2 eV (Fe 2p1/2)33 in Fig. 3C after reduction, revealing the successful exsolution of Fe. Based on the quantitative analysis by XPS, the atomic ratio of Co0/Fe0 was around 32/68. Our results are consistent with the report that during reduction, metallic Co and Fe were at first formed on the surface of the backbone, followed by formation of the Co–Fe alloy.34 As mentioned before, the oxygen vacancy could effectively improve the ability of CO2 chemical adsorption and activate CO2 on those defective sites.18 The O 1s spectra of both materials are presented in Fig. 3D1 and D2. Two partially superimposed peaks at 528.7 and 531.0 eV were deconvoluted, corresponding to the lattice oxygen and the adsorbed or loosely bonded oxygen (correlated with surface oxygen vacancies), respectively.35 Apparently, the PSFM backbone possessed a higher proportion of adsorbed oxygen species at the surface with respect to lattice oxygen than PSCFM. In addition, a prominent decrease in the lattice oxygen on the Co–Fe–PSFM surface was observed when comparing with that on the PSCFM surface. This was caused by the exsolution of Co and Fe from oxides as pure metals in conjunction with the continuous formation of oxygen vacancies, suggesting that oxygen vacancies can be further generated in the exsolving process. The high surface oxygen vacancies make double-layered PSFM a promising electrochemically active catalyst.

2.2 Evaluation of redox stability
Michael Nolan36 reported that doping of transition metal cations could modify the reactivity of ceramic materials with respect to oxygen vacancy formation and molecular adsorption. The doped cations result in strong structural distortion and lower oxygen vacancy formation energy, while oxygen vacancies generated on the perovskite oxides have been considered to be able to effectively improve the chemical adsorption of CO2. The chemically adsorbed CO2 is strongly activated on the oxygen vacancy-related defective sites, which favors the electrochemical CO2 electrolysis at elevated temperatures.18
To further evaluate the oxygen vacancy formation and to investigate the redox stability of the obtained materials, the PSCFM powders were reduced in a H2 flow at an elevated ramping temperature range from 20 to 1000 °C, cooled down to room temperature and re-oxidized up to 1000 °C in air (10 °C min−1). The weight loss under the reducing conditions in conjunction with the differential thermal analysis is recorded in Fig. 4A. The gradual weight loss of ∼0.30 wt% below 380 °C (step 1) was attributed to the loss of H2O.22,37 The weight experienced a sharp drop between 380 °C and 520 °C (step 2) during the ramping process. This was mostly attributed to the oxygen vacancy formation and/or a decrease in oxygen content during the phase change process under the reducing conditions. The inset is the differential thermal analysis curve, which clearly shows the presence of a sharp exothermic peak on heating at 463.2 °C, confirming the phase change within the temperature range. After that, a continuous decrease of the weight during the ramping process was attributed to the further loss of lattice oxygen because of the reduction of Co- and Fe-containing oxides to the in situ exsolved Co and Fe (step 3). The reversibility of the phase change during the redox cycle is shown in Fig. 4B. Clearly, the weight of Co–Fe–PSFM sharply increased during re-oxidation in air during the ramping process, which was attributed to the re-oxidation of Co–Fe–PSFM to PSCFM. A weight gain and decrease of 6.62 wt% and 6.67 wt% were observed for the re-oxidation and reduction processes, respectively, corresponding to the uptake and loss of oxygen. Moreover, the XRD pattern shows that the powders after re-oxidation retain the same cubic structure (Fig. S3†). The double-layered perovskite Co–Fe–PSFM with high oxygen mobility possesses remarkable variability in terms of oxygen content under redox conditions, indicating that a reversible oxygen switchover in the lattice takes place.17 This symmetry between reduction and re-oxidation cycles suggests excellent redox reversibility.

2.3 Evaluation of electrochemical performance
To evaluate the electrochemical performance, both Co–Fe–PSFM/GDC (cell 1) and PSCFM/GDC (cell 2) composite cathodes were separately fabricated in a YSZ electrolyte supported SOEC. CO2/CO with a ratio of 70/30 continuously flowed through the cathode side at a rate of 30 ml min−1 (the flow rates measured at the outlets of cells 1 and 2 were 29.0 and 26.0 ml min−1, respectively). Fig. 5A shows the polarization curves (I–V) of cells 1 and 2 in the potential range from −0.5 to −1.0 V (vs. OCV) at 850 °C. The I–V curves went smoothly from the SOFC mode (positive X-axis) to the SOEC mode (negative X-axis), suggesting that both cells had good reversibility and besides SOEC, the newly developed material could also be potentially used in the SOFC field. An impressive current density of 0.80 A cm−2 at 1.6 V and 850 °C was observed (cell 2). This is comparable, under the same conditions, with the 0.9 and 0.84 A cm−2 of cubic perovskite Ce-doped La(Sr)Cr(Fe)15 and double-layered PrBaMnO,17 respectively. In contrast, cell 1 with Co–Fe–PSFM shows a 20% increase in the value of current density at 1.6 V and 850 °C. The enhanced current density can be ascribed to the effects of increased adsorbed oxygen on the surface of PSFM and the high catalytic activity of the exsolved Co–Fe alloy. To better understand the factors credited for the remarkable electrochemical performance of cell 1, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to examine the electrochemical activity of the material for CO2 electrolysis at a stable open circuit voltage at 850 °C. The Nyquist plots of the impedance spectra together with the simulated curves of cells 1 and 2 are presented in Fig. 5B. The inset is the equivalent circuit. Clearly, the simulated values are all in consistence with the experimental measurements, proving the suitability of the equivalent circuit simulating both cells. The difference between the real axes intercepts at the high and low frequencies of each impedance loop represents the electrode polarization resistance (Rp = R1 + R2).38 The resistance, after normalizing with the electrode area, is called area-specific resistance (ASR) which is an indicator to assess the catalytic activity for the CO2 electrolysis. A lower ASR value means higher catalytic activity. The simulated values of the parameters of the equivalent circuit for both cells are summarized in Table 1. As expected, the total activation polarization (Rp) value of cell 1 was as low as 0.455 Ω cm2 at 850 °C, about 0.1 Ω cm2 lower as compared to that of cell 2, indicating that Co–Fe–PSFM effectively promoted the electrode kinetics reaction as a result of its high oxygen vacancy concentration, enhanced electrical conductivity and catalytic activity.

To examine the electrolysis performance, potentiostatic tests for both cells 1 and 2 were conducted at different applied potentials (vs. OCV) at 850 °C. The outlet products were analyzed by on-line gas chromatography (GC) in 30 min intervals (a GC run repeated every 10 min for three measurements) at each potential. The average value of every three runs was taken as the CO volume concentration with the 30 min interval for each potential. The volume concentration of CO as a function of applied potential (vs. OCV) for the CO2 electrolysis is recorded in Fig. 5C and S4A† to evaluate the current utilization efficiency (Faraday efficiency, FE). Apparently, the conversion of CO2 to CO of both cells increased with the rising applied potential. At the potential of 0.8 V (vs. OCV) for cells 1 and 2, the corresponding CO volume concentrations reached the values of ∼51.6% and ∼50.3% in the outlet gases at 850 °C, respectively. Upon continuously increasing the applied potential, a slight drop of CO percentage in the outlet gases occurred, resulting from the local starvation of CO2 in the inlet gas and the restrained oxygen evolution at the anode side.4 Normally, this will lead to a large electrode polarization and low current efficiency for the electrolysis of CO2 at high temperature. Additionally, production rates of CO and FEs at different applied potentials for both cells were also calculated, as shown in Fig. 5D and S4B.† The CO production rates of cells 1 and 2 reached 6.33 and 5.36 ml min−1 at the potentials of 0.8 V (vs. OCV), respectively. The decreased production rates after 0.8 V (vs. OCV) are believed to be caused by the local starvation of CO2. To evaluate the current utilization efficiency, FEs were calculated using the current densities and CO production rates and the results are also shown in Fig. 5D and S4B.† The FE of cell 1 increased and reached a peak value of ∼93% at potentials below 0.8 V (vs. OCV). This is considerably higher than the reported values of ∼85% in both Mn-doped La(Sr)Ti18 and La(Sr)Cr(Mn) embedded with exsolved Cu nanoparticles,10 and 89% in La(Sr)Cr(Fe) with exsolved Fe nanoparticles.14 The impressive high conversion of CO2 in conjunction with the high FE of the new material fabricated in this work confirms the excellent catalytic activity of Co–Fe–PSFM for CO2 electrolysis at high temperature.
2.4 Evaluation of long-term stability and coking resistance
To assess the coking resistance of PSFM with the Co–Fe alloy nanoparticles, a constant potential of 0.4 V (vs. OCV) was applied to the cell for the long-term stability test; the cell current densities were recorded as a function of time in a CO2/CO (70:30) flow at 850 °C, as shown in Fig. 6A. The current densities of the cell with Co–Fe–PSFM stabilized at the value of ∼0.4 A cm−2 after the initial transition stage, the corresponding FEs were found to fluctuate slightly at an average value of 87.7% with the testing interval of 10 h between each run. Normally, carbon can be easily generated on a conventional Ni-based cathode when directly operating in such a carbon-abundant atmosphere.39,40 Significantly, no degradation was observed and cell 1 showed a slight increase in the current density instead in the CO2/CO environment at the constant applied potential of 0.4 V (vs. OCV) and 850 °C for the testing period of 100 h, indicating that no coking occurs. The cathode cross-section of the cell after the long-term stability test was examined by high-resolution SEM, as seen in Fig. 6B. The porous cathode attached firmly to the YSZ electrolyte, an indication of the good thermal compatibility between the newly developed cathode and the YSZ electrolyte. Based on the XRD pattern of PSCFM/GDC in Fig. S5A,† the phases in the cathode layer were still GDC and PSCFM. No other obvious peaks related to the cathode were observed, and this in turn indicated that the material was quite stable under the feed-gas conditions. Additionally, the compositional line profile clearly demonstrated that the GDC buffer layer successfully prevented the inter-diffusion of ionic species between the cathode layer and the YSZ electrolyte (Fig. 6B). Also, the EDS mapping verified the uniform distribution of Co–Fe alloy nanoparticles through the entire cathode layer (Fig. S5B†). In addition, the Co–Fe alloy nanoparticles were still uniformly embedded on the surface of the PSFM backbone after the cell testing. They still retained their nanoparticle shape with the size of ∼50 nm as compared to the ones before testing, and no visible carbon deposition was observed on the surface of the backbone (Fig. 6C). This suggests that the Co–Fe nanoparticles were stable under the cell operating conditions. The cathode surfaces of PSCFM/GDC, Co–Fe–PSFM/GDC and Ni/GDC after exposure to CO2/CO were analyzed by ex situ Raman spectroscopy. Representative Raman spectra collected on these cathodes are recorded in Fig. 6D. The D band at ∼1346 cm−1 is associated with the disordered graphite, while the G band at ∼1561 cm−1 corresponds to the highly ordered graphite.41 As seen, no carbon formation was detected on both PSCFM/GDC and Co–Fe–PSFM/GDC cathode surfaces [Fig. 6D(b) and (c)]. However, two typical carbon features in the Raman spectra located at ∼1339.2 and ∼1571.0 cm−1 were observed for the Ni/GDC cathode surface [Fig. 6D(a)]. This confirms that both Co–Fe–PSFM and PSCFM have excellent coking resistance towards the co-presence of CO2/CO. Particularly, Co–Fe–PSFM not only shows high catalytic activity for CO2 electrolysis but also possesses excellent coking resistance, which makes it a potential cathode material suitable for direct CO2 electrolysis at high temperatures.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we developed a new cathode material with in situ exsolved Co–Fe alloy nanoparticles embedded on an active double-layered perovskite backbone, which acts as a stable and efficient catalyst to promote the electrochemical performance of CO2 electrolysis in a SOEC. This material exhibits superb redox reversibility between reduction and re-oxidation cycles. In addition, an enhanced oxygen vacancy content, in comparison with PSCFM, was achieved after both the exsolving process and phase change. Furthermore, PSFM with Co–Fe alloy nanoparticles has rather low polarization ASR (∼0.455 Ω cm2 at 850 °C). A considerably high current density of 1.01 A cm−2 for a SOEC with the Co–Fe–PSFM cathode was achieved at 1.6 V and 850 °C. The cell with the new cathode showed excellent coking resistance and no degradation was observed at 850 °C for 100 h. More importantly, the FE reached a value as high as ∼93% at an applied potential of 0.8 V (vs. OCV) and 850 °C. As compared with PSCFM, the improved oxygen vacancies of PSFM, together with the exsolved Co–Fe alloy nanoparticles, contributed to the excellent catalytic activity, high FE and good stability for CO2 electrolysis. Therefore, this design concept may point to a new direction towards fabrication of cathodes with high performance and stability for high temperature CO2 electrolysis.
