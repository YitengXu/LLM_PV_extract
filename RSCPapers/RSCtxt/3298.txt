    , Accepted 10th January 2015First published on 19th January 2015AbstractEfficient titanium nitride/titanium oxide (TiN/TiO2) composite photoanodes have been proposed for the use not only in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) but also for water splitting. When the TiN precursor films were sintered at 500 °C for 0.5 to 4 h, they were partially converted to crystalline TiO2 containing both rutile and anatase phases. For the DSSCs, higher TiN content in the photoanodes resulted in a more negative flat-band potential and higher conductivity but lower surface area for the dye adsorption; therefore, the increase in VOC and FF but the decrease in JSC value were observed. The best DSSC, with TiN/TiO2 composite photoanode annealed for 1 h, exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 7.27%, while the cell without TiN, i.e., the cell with a standard P25 photoanode, showed an efficiency of 7.02%. For the water splitting, higher TiN content in the photoanodes resulted in better triggering of the H2O electrolysis, but less photo-induced current response at UV light illumination. Considering the water splitting performance measured at AM 1.5G, the TiN/TiO2 composite photoanode annealed for 1 h showed the best photo-induced current density (Jpho) of 0.12 mA cm−2, as compared with that of the standard P25 film. With the TiN/TiO2 composite photoanode annealed for 1 h, both DSSCs and water splitting electrochemical devices achieved their best performance independently.
Introduction
Titanium nitride (TiN) is an important functional material and has several attractive properties. It exhibits high hardness, excellent thermal and electrical conductivity, good chemical stability and biocompatibility, good corrosion resistance, and high absorption in the visible light range.1–4 Titanium nitride-based thin films have been proposed for many applications, including nitrite detection,5 pollution degradation,6,7 heterojunction photovoltaics,8 resonators,9–11 biosensors,12–14 DNA sequencing electrodes,15 fuel cells,16–19 water splitting,20–23 supercapacitors,24–26 superconductors,27–29 lithium batteries,30–32 field effect transistors,33 and dye-sensitized solar cells.6,34–42
Nowadays, the severe energy shortage has led to an urgent requirement for developing sustainable and clean energy resources. Among these, solar energy is considered as a promising renewable power supplement without limitation because it can be converted into electrical, chemical or thermal energy. In this regard, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are the main solar-to-electrical energy conversion devices and have been attracting great attention in recent years. They have been extensively investigated since 1991,43 owing to their outstanding advantages, e.g., low-cost production possibility, good compatibility to the environment, and high conversion efficiency. A DSSC usually consists of three key parts: a dye-adsorbed TiO2 film as the photoanode, an electrolyte with the redox couple of iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−), and a platinum-coated counter electrode (Pt-CE). Among these, TiO2 plays a very important role in providing large surface area for the dye adsorption and in transferring the electrons to the outer circuit. Therefore, crystallinity, conductivity, and porosity of the TiO2 film can affect the performance of the DSSC. The inherent conductivity of a TiO2 film is very low, and results in poor electron transport through the film to the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting substrate. The cell efficiency is, therefore, limited by overwhelming interfacial recombination reactions between the excited electrons and I3− ions. Many researchers have introduced a number of additives with high conductivity, including gold nanoparticles,44,45 silver nanoparticles,46 carbon-based materials,47–49 transition-metal-based materials,50,51 into the TiO2 films to enhance their electrical conductivity and retard the charge recombination reactions. Yoo et al. introduced TiN as a charge collector to cover onto the TiO2 layer in a transparent conducting oxide (TCO)-less photoanode (a special design);52 the TiN successfully retarded the recombination between the injected electrons and I3− ions. Lee et al. incorporated pristine TiN and thermally-treated TiN (tt-TiN) nanoparticles into binder-free TiO2 films to enhance physical-necking between the TiO2 particles.34 Sun et al. applied nitrogen doped titanium dioxide (N-TiO2) and nitrogen–carbon co-doped titanium dioxide (CN-TiO2) photoanodes for DSSCs;6 the DSSCs with N-TiO2 and CN-TiO2 photoanodes exhibited power conversion efficiencies (η) of 2.44% and 3.31%, respectively, which are higher than that of the DSSC with standard P25 photoanode (1.61%).
On the other hand, solar-to-chemical conversion is usually accomplished in terms of hydrogen production via water splitting through a photoelectrochemical reaction. The electrochemical cell for water splitting is similar to a DSSC; it also contains three important parts: a photocatalytic semiconductor film as the photoanode, an electrolyte, and a counter electrode (CE).53 Instead of using the dye in a DSSC, the semiconductor film generates photoelectrons and holes in an electrochemical cell for water splitting. The photoelectrons then trigger the production of H2 (water reduction) at the CE/electrolyte interface; simultaneously the holes trigger water oxidation to produce O2 at the surface of the photoanode. Generally, the performance of a photocatalyst (semiconductor film) could be limited by its energy band gap, crystallinity, conductivity, porosity, and stability. Numerous investigations have been made to develop efficient photocatalysts with a low energy band gap, high conductivity, and large porosity, intending to retard photoelectron–hole recombination.54–57 Maeda et al. applied titanium fluorooxynitride (TiNxOyFz) powder as the photocatalyst for water oxidation in the presence of silver nitrate as the sacrificial electron acceptor;23 the nitrogen content in TiNxOyFz was reported to be responsible for a broad photocatalytic activity in the visible light region. Chen et al. used F-TiO2 and TiN/F-TiO2 nanoparticles as the consuming photocatalysts for water-photo-oxidation.21 The photocatalytic activity of TiN/F-TiO2 was found to be higher than those of TiO2 and F-TiO2, due to two reasons: (1) the red shift in the absorption spectra introduced by the additional TiN nanoparticles; (2) the more efficient separation between the photo-induced electrons and holes provided by the additional Ti3+ reactive center on the TiN surface. Li et al. synthesized the solid yolk–shell and hollow TiN microspheres separately, and applied them as visible light-induced photocatalysts for water splitting.20 They achieved good photo-induced current densities of 0.020, 0.035, and 0.030 mA cm−2 for the solid yolk–shell and hollow TiN photocatalysts, respectively. TiN microspheres provide narrow energy band gap for visible light absorption, high surface area, good stability, and excellent electrical conductivity, which facilitated light harvesting, and thereby enhanced photo-induced current density by suppressing photoelectron–hole recombination.
According to the literature mentioned above, we aim in this study to prepare the effective TiN-based thin films as the photoanode for the two types of clean energy applications, namely, the DSSCs and water splitting separately. A simple doctor blade procedure followed by a post-annealing treatment is successfully introduced. By applying thermal treatment at 500 °C for different periods, TiN films could be partially converted to crystalline TiO2, and the composite films containing both TiN and crystalline TiO2 are applied as the photoanodes for the DSSCs or for water splitting separately. We explore several key parameters, including the conductivity and the flat-band potential of the films, to determine the best performance for both the applications.
Experimental
Materials
Titanium(IV) tetraisoproproxide (TTIP, >98%), ethanol (EtOH, 99.5%), isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99.5%), and 2-methoxyethanol (≥99.5%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Lithium iodide (LiI, synthetic grade) and iodine (I2, synthetic grade) were purchased from Merck. Acetone (99+%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 96%), and tert-butyl alcohol (tBA, 96%) were supplied by Acros. 3-Methoxypropionitrile (MPN, 99%) was received from Fluka. 1,2-Dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII) and 25 μm thick Surlyn® (SX1170-25) were bought from Solaronix (S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland). Potassium sulfate (K2SO4, 99.99%), acetonitrile (ACN, 99.99%), nitric acid (HNO3, ca. 65% solution in water), and dichloromethane (DCM, 99.99%) were procured from J. T. Baker. Titanium nitride nanoparticles (TiN, 99.9%, 50 nm) were acquired from Wako. Commercial titanium dioxide nanoparticles (P25, 99.9%, 20 nm, UR-ITIT001) were obtained from UniRegion Bio-Tech. Indium-doped tin oxide (ITO, 10 Ω sq−1, UR-ITO007-0.7 mm) conducting glasses were provided by Uni-onward Corp., Taiwan. Fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO, TEC-7, 7 Ω sq−1) conducting glasses were supplied by NSG America, Inc., New Jersey, USA.
Fabrication and characterization of TiN films
ITO and FTO conducting glasses were first cleaned with a neutral cleaner, and then sequentially washed with deionized water (DIW), acetone, and isopropanol. A standard TiO2 paste was prepared by adding 15 wt% of commercial P25 nanoparticles and 15 wt% of home-made polymeric dispersant, poly(oxyethylene)-segmented imide (POEM), into DIW/EtOH (at the volume ratio of 7/3). The TiN paste contained 15 wt% of TiN nanoparticles and 15 wt% of POEM in DIW/EtOH (volume ratio = 7/3). The dispersant, POEM, was prepared according to our previous report58,59 using the procedure shown in Scheme S1,† and was used to control the pore diameters in the films and to prevent the films from being cracked during drying. Then, the TiO2 film and TiN-based film were prepared using the P25 paste and TiN paste, respectively. First, the FTO conducting surface was spin-coated with a 100 nm-compact layer using a mixture solution of TTIP/2-methoxyethanol (at the weight ratio of 1/3). The porous TiO2 (P25) film and TiN-based films were coated on the treated FTO glasses, each for a thickness of 12 μm, using a doctor blade technique. The P25 films were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min in air, and the TiN-based films were sintered at 500 °C for 0.5 to 4 h in air. The photoanodes were designated as P25, TiN/TiO2-0.5h, TiN/TiO2-1h, TiN/TiO2-2h, TiN/TiO2-4h separately.
The surface areas of P25 and TiN nanoparticles were quantified by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, ASAP2010, Micromeritics, USA) measurements. The dispersion of the TiN nanoparticles in POEM aqueous solution was examined using an UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (JASCO V-670, USA). To find out the crystalline phases of the P25 and all TiN/TiO2 composite films, an X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) technique was used. A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Nova NanoSEM 230, FEI, Oregon, USA), coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDX, Oxford INCA x-act), was applied for observing the surface morphology of the films. A four-point probe technique was employed to obtain the conductivities of the films; the conductivities were recorded by a Keithley's instrument (Keithley 2400, Keithley Instruments Inc., USA).
Fabrication of DSSCs
After the sintering process, the P25 and all TiN/TiO2 composite films were patterned for an area of 0.16 cm2 and were immersed in a DCM-based 5 × 10−4 M CR147 dye solution at room temperature for 24 h to obtain P25 and TiN/TiO2 composites photoanodes. The new non-commercial CR147 dye, represented in Scheme S2,† is a very efficient organic dye.60,61 A standard platinum (Pt) CE was prepared by direct current sputtering a Pt thin film on an ITO substrate for a thickness of 50 nm. Then, the photoanode was coupled with the platinum counter electrode (Pt-CE) maintaining a fixed gap of 25 μm between the two electrodes using a heated 25 μm-thick Surlyn® film. The electrolyte, containing 0.7 M DMPII, 0.038 M I2, and 0.5 M TBP in MPN/ACN with a volume ratio of 1/1, was injected into the gap between the electrodes by capillarity.
Evaluation of DSSCs performance
The performances of the DSSCs with different photoanodes were evaluated by a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, The Netherlands), under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination, using a class A quality solar simulator (XES-301S, AM1.5G, San-Ei Electric Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). The incident light intensity was calibrated with a standard Si cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of the DSSCs with various photoanodes were obtained by the potentiostat/galvanostat and another class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan), equipped with a monochromator (model 74100, Oriel Instrument, California, USA). The incident radiation flux (φ) was obtained using an optical detector (model 71580, Oriel Instrument, California, USA) and a power meter (model 70310, Oriel Instrument, California, USA). Electrochemical properties of the DSSCs were measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS spectra were obtained by the above-mentioned potentiostat/galvanostat, equipped with an FRA2 module; the explored frequency range was from 10 mHz to 65 kHz, and the corresponding ac amplitude was 10 mV. Under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination, the applied bias for a DSSC was set at its open-circuit voltage. Under dark condition, the applied bias for all the DSSCs was set at −0.80 V. The impedance spectra were analysed using an equivalent circuit model.62 Moreover, the dye loading amounts on the films were measured following several steps as follows: (1) five bottles of CR147 dye solutions with the same dye concentration (5 × 10−4 M) were prepared; (2) the P25 TiO2 film and four different TiN/TiO2 composite films (1 cm2, with a thickness of 12 μm) were immersed in the dye-solutions; (3) the dye-adsorbed films were removed after 24 h; (4) the absorption spectra of the residual dye solutions were measured using an UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Fig. S1a†); (5) pertinent absorption intensities were obtained at 483 nm (the λmax of CR147); (6) the concentrations of the dyes were determined using the calibration curve of standard CR147 solution (Fig. S1b†); the difference between the concentrations of the dyes in the original solution (5 × 10−4 M) and residual solution gives the dye loading amount on a film.
Evaluation of water splitting performance
The performance of the photoanodes for water splitting could be estimated by measuring the photo-induced current densities of their electrochemical cells. The photo-induced current densities were measured by the potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, Netherlands) in a three-electrode electrochemical system. The P25 and TiN/TiO2 composite films (1 cm2) were used as the working electrodes; a Pt foil and a Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The electrolyte was an aqueous solution (pH = 7) containing 0.5 M K2SO4 as the supporting electrolyte. The measurements were carried out under the following conditions: (1) a 35 mW cm−2 ultraviolet light (UV) illumination by an UV light generator (filter: 320–500 nm, OmniCure Series 1000, EXFO Photonic Solutions Inc., Canada), and (2) a 100 mW cm−2 sun light illumination by a class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan). The incident light intensity was calibrated with the same standard Si cell mentioned above. Energy band gaps of the TiO2 and TiN/TiO2 composite films were determined using their absorption and transmittance spectra, which were obtained by the UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer, equipped with an integrating sphere. Flat band potentials of the films were estimated from their Mott–Schottky plots, obtained by the same three-electrode electrochemical system mentioned above. The potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 900B, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, Netherlands), equipped with a frequency response analyser, was used to obtain the Mott–Schottky plots.
Results and discussion
Surface area and dispersibility of TiN and P25 nanoparticles
A specific surface area analyser was used to obtain Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) adsorption/desorption curves of TiN and P25 by nitrogen gas adsorption. In Fig. S2,† it can be clearly seen that the TiN nanoparticles (TiN-NPs, 50 nm) adsorb lower amount of nitrogen than the P25 nanoparticles (P25-NPs, 20 nm). The BET surface area was calculated to be 25.66 m2 g−1 for TiN-NPs and 44.74 m2 g−1 for P25-NPs, i.e., the surface area of TiN-NPs is only 0.57 times that of P25-NPs. On the other hand, the dispersibility of pristine TiN-NPs could be tested by using UV-vis-NIR spectra of two aqueous solutions containing TiN or TiN/POEM separately. Fig. S3† shows the plots of normalized absorption at 730 nm versus time for both solutions. It can be seen that the aqueous solution containing only TiN-NPs shows an absorption decrease of 38% after 6 h, whereas the aqueous solution containing TiN/POEM does not show any absorption decrease after the same period. In the case of TiN/POEM, the absorption remained roughly constant because the TiN-NPs are placed well distributed and intact in it. Without the presence of POEM, TiN-NPs settled down after 6 h, and the absorption decreased owing to the absence of most of TiN-NPs in the path of UV-vis light. It is, thus, clear that the home-made POEM polymer is an effective dispersant for TiN-NPs.
Morphology

Fig. 1 shows plane view FE-SEM images of the films of pre-annealed TiN, TiN/TiO2-0.5h, TiN/TiO2-1h, TiN/TiO2-2h, TiN/TiO2-4h, and P25. In Fig. 1a, the pre-annealed TiN film shows a porous structure but with rather loose connections among the TiN-NPs. The necking of particles in other films appears to be slightly better than that in the pristine TiN film; it is well known that annealing of a TiO2 film below 500 °C improves the necking among the particles of the film. From Fig. 1b–e, all the annealed TiN/TiO2 composite films maintain a three dimensional porous structure without any aggregation and combination of TiN/TiO2-NPs, which perfectly fits with the demands of the photoanodes for DSSCs or for water splitting. Therefore, it can be verified that the home-made POEM polymer dispersant not only provides great dispersion ability to TiN-NPs, but also prevents its aggregation and combination during the post-thermal process. A similar porous structure for the standard P25 film was also observed, as seen in Fig. 1f. Note that the TiN/TiO2 composite films and P25 film all exhibit a thickness of 12 μm. Fig. S4a and S4b† show cross-sectional FE-SEM images of a TiN/TiO2 composite film and of the P25 film, respectively. Moreover, the coverage of TiO2 component on the surface of the TiN/TiO2 composite film was investigated by an elemental mapping technique, using an EDX spectroscope. As shown in Fig. S5,† the red dots represent the signals of oxygen, which refer to the formation of TiO2, while the green dots represent the signals of nitrogen, which refer to the residual TiN. Herein, each element is detected at its K atomic orbital. On all TiN/TiO2 composite films, both oxygen and nitrogen are distributed uniformly. Increase in the annealing period of a composite film increases its content of oxygen and decreases that of nitrogen.

X-ray diffraction patterns
In Fig. 2, the pre-annealed TiN film shows strong peaks at the 2θ values of 33.43°, 37.18°, 38.65°, 43.03°, 62.21°, 74.41°, and 78.44°, which correspond to a pure TiN cubic crystalline, according to JCPDS card no. 02-1221. Upon increasing the annealing period, all the annealed TiN/TiO2 composite films show an obvious decrease in the peaks of crystalline TiN and the increase in the peaks referring to the crystalline TiO2, containing both anatase and rutile crystal phases simultaneously. It is clear that the crystalline TiN transforms into crystalline TiO2 in all the annealed TiN/TiO2 composite films. The TiN-transformed anatase TiO2 can be confirmed by the peaks at the 2θ values of 25.67° and 48.79°, which correspond to the tetragonal crystal planes of (101) and (200), respectively (JCPDS card no. 75-1537). The TiN-transformed rutile TiO2 can be confirmed by the peaks at the 2θ values of 27.87°, 36.43°, 41.72°, and 54.98°, which correspond to the tetragonal crystal planes of (110), (101), (111), and (211), respectively (JCPDS card no. 88-1175). The standard P25 film also exhibits crystalline TiO2 with both anatase and rutile crystal phases. Furthermore, the degree of conversion of an annealed TiN/TiO2 composite film could be estimated by comparing the peak intensity of the TiN primary (200) crystal plane with that of the pre-annealed film. The degrees of conversion were found to be 57.10%, 71.18%, 84.57%, and 86.77% at the annealing periods of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h, respectively. At the annealing period of 4 h, the crystal phase of TiN/TiO2-4h film is nearly the same as that of P25 film. On the other hand, an interesting color change of the TiN/TiO2 composite films with different annealing periods are observed and shown correspondingly in the photographs near the XRD patterns in Fig. 2. The pre-annealed TiN film (annealed for 0 h) shows a uniform dark blue surface without any cracks. With increasing annealing time, the film color changes from dark blue to white; this change is in consistency with the crystalline phase transformation of all TiN/TiO2 composite films. The standard P25 film shows a uniform white surface without any cracks.

Optical spectra
The absorption and transmittance spectra of the films of TiN/TiO2-0.5h, TiN/TiO2-1h, TiN/TiO2-2h, TiN/TiO2-4h, and P25, were measured in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm and the results are shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3a, all TiN/TiO2 composite films and the P25 film show one set of absorption peaks in the wavelength range from 300 to 400 nm, which corresponds to the TiO2 contents (prefer UV absorption) of the films. Another set of absorption waves from 400 to 800 nm and corresponds to the TiN contents (prefer visible absorption) in the films. In brief, the higher TiN content in the films causes higher visible light absorption; this phenomenon may be attributed to the narrower energy band gap20 and the plasmonic effect provided by TiN.63–65 In Fig. 3b, the transmittance of a TiN/TiO2 composite film decreases with increasing content of the TiN, which agrees well with the absorption behavior of the film.

DSSCs performance
Photocurrent density–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs with various photoanodes are shown in Fig. 4a. At 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) illumination, the P25 photoanode adsorbed with CR147 rendered its DSSC a conversion efficiency of 7.02%. As summarized in Table 1, all the DSSCs with TiN/TiO2 composite photoanodes show higher VOC and FF but lower JSC values than those of the DSSC with P25 photoanode. The higher VOC is due to the more negative flat band potential provided by the TiN/TiO2 composite film containing higher TiN content; the higher FF is due to higher conductivity of the TiN/TiO2 composite film containing higher TiN content.

It will be proved in further discussions through Mott–Schottky plots that all TiN/TiO2 composite films have more negative flat-band potentials than that of P25. However, with increasing annealing period, the increasing TiO2 content in the photoanodes contributes to the more preferable surface area for the dye adsorption, thus the JSC values of their DSSCs increases. In the schematic summary in Scheme 1, there are three key factors affecting the efficiency of a DSSC, including the flat band potential, conductivity, and dye loading amount of the TiN/TiO2 composite photoanode. Therefore, the best DSSC with the TiN/TiO2-1h photoanode exhibits a power conversion efficiency (η) of 7.27% with VOC of 784 mV, JSC of 12.68 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.70, and it provides higher cell efficiency than that of the standard cell with P25 photoanode.
 Scheme 1  A schematic summary of the key factors that influence the DSSC performance. 
Under dark condition, the higher onset bias for the dark current of a DSSC implies the better suppression of charge recombination, and thereby the higher VOC for the DSSC. The values of onset bias were obtained from the intersection points of two fitting lines: one is the tangent to the curve starting from the voltage scale; the other is the zero-current line. In Fig. 4b, the onset bias values for the dark currents of the DSSCs with TiN/TiO2-0.5h, TiN/TiO2-1h, TiN/TiO2-2h, TiN/TiO2-4h, and P25 photoanodes can be found at 719, 701, 679, 656, and 656 mV, respectively. With increasing annealing time, the onset bias values decrease, which is in great consistency with the corresponding decreasing VOC values. Similar results can be clearly seen from the plots of logarithmic dark current density versus applied voltage for the DSSCs with different photoanodes, as shown in Fig. S6.† Therefore, the introduction of TiN/TiO2 composite photoanodes is a proper approach for improving the VOC and preventing the electron recombination in a DSSC.

Fig. 4c shows incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of the DSSCs with different photoanodes. The maximum IPCE values of the DSSCs with TiN/TiO2-0.5h, TiN/TiO2-1h, TiN/TiO2-2h, TiN/TiO2-4h, and P25 photoanodes at 480 nm are 75.30%, 78.11%, 79.56%, 79.06%, and 81.60%, respectively. It is well known that the higher the IPCE is, the higher the JSC becomes. The under-lined area of an IPCE curve can be further integrated to calculate the theoretical short-circuit current density, (JSC)IPCE, of the pertinent DSSC. In Table 1, the (JSC)IPCE values have been summarised and show a great consistency with the JSC values obtained from the J–V curves.
Electrochemical impedance spectra of the DSSCs
Electrochemical impedance spectra of the DSSCs with different photoanodes were used to explain the DSSCs performance mentioned above. Under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination, the charge transfer resistance (Rct2) and electron recombination life time (τe) can be used to investigate the charge transfer phenomenon at the photoanode/electrolyte interface; those values can be obtained by fitting the impedance data to an equivalent circuit,62 which is presented as the inset of Fig. 5a. In Fig. 5a, the Rct2 value of a DSSC can be obtained from the diameter of the second semicircle in its Nyquist plot, measured at lower frequencies (10–100 Hz range). In Fig. 5b, the electron life time (τe) of a DSSC can be calculated from its Bode plot by applying the frequency value at the maxima phase (fmax) into eqn (1):62 τe = (2πfmax)−1(1)
 Fig. 5  (a) Nyquist plots and (b) Bode plots of the DSSCs with various photoanodes, measured at 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G). (c) Nyquist plots of the DSSCs with various photoanodes, measured under dark condition at an applied potential of −0.80 V. 

Table 1 gives the values of Rct2 and τe for different DSSCs with different photoanodes. A larger Rct2 value indicates the lesser charge passes through the photoanode/electrolyte interface, and thereby a lower current density for the DSSC. Table 1 shows that the trend of JSC values is consistent with that of Rct2 values. A larger τe value indicates a better retardation for the electron recombination with I−/I3− redox couple, and thereby a higher VOC value for the DSSC. Table 1 also shows the consistent tendency between the VOC values and the τe values.
Under dark conditions, the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) at the photoanode/electrolyte interface can be measured at the applied potential of −0.80 V, which is close to the VOC value obtained in this work. In Fig. 5c, the Rrec value of a DSSC can be estimated from the diameter of the second semicircle in its Nyquist plot, measured at lower frequencies (10–100 Hz range).62 A higher Rrec value indicates a better suppression for the electron recombination with I−/I3− redox couple, and thereby a higher VOC value for the DSSC. It can be seen in Table 1 that the VOC values are consistent with the Rrec values.
Water splitting performance
With regard to the water splitting reaction under light illumination, when the applied voltage is more positive than the flat-band potential of the photoanode (also as the semiconductors), the photoanode produces both electrons and holes (eqn (2)). The holes generated in the valance band (VB) of the photoanode trigger the oxidation of H2O (eqn (3)). At the same time, the electrons produced in the conduction band (CB) of the photoanode trigger the reduction of H2O, evolving H2 simultaneously (eqn (4)).53 The standard potentials (E0) for the oxidation of H2O and reduction of H2O are at 1.23 V and 0.00 V versus normal hydrogen electrode, respectively. (2) (3) 2H2O + 2e− → H2 + 2OH−, E0 = 0.00 V vs. NHE(4)
The current density–voltage characteristics of the water splitting electrochemical cells coupled with various TiN/TiO2 composite films as the photoanodes are measured at AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) using a chopping method and shown in Fig. 6. Accordingly, the specific photo-induced current density (Jpho), which is the difference between the current densities obtained under illumination and dark condition, can be extracted and summarized in Table 1. The highest Jpho (0.12 mA cm−2) is obtained for the cell with TiN/TiO2-1h photoanode, which is even higher than that obtained for the device with P25 (0.05 mA cm−2), as shown in Fig. S7.† For further investigation, we provide the photo-induced current densities of various TiN/TiO2 composite photoanodes measured under ultraviolet (UV) light illumination, (Jpho)UV, as shown in Fig. S8.† It is found that the (Jpho)UV steadily increases (from 0.84 to 3.13 mA cm−2) with increase in the annealing time, due to the increasing TiO2 proportion in the composite films enhances UV light absorption. Because there is 5% light intensity contributed by the UV light region in the solar light spectrum at AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2), the higher (Jpho)UV value of a TiN/TiO2 composite film may cause the higher Jpho value.

On the other hand, the higher TiN proportion in the films brings the more negative flat-band potential for better triggering the H2O redox. This will be proved in further discussions through the Mott–Schottky plots and corresponding energy diagrams. In summary, there are two key factors affecting the Jpho value of the film obtained at AM 1.5G: one is its (Jpho)UV response, and the other is its flat-band potential. Therefore, the TiN/TiO2-1h photoanode shows the best water splitting performance with the highest Jpho of 0.12 mA cm−2.
Energy band diagram
The energy band diagram of a photoanode can be accomplished by calculating its energy band gap (Eg) via UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer, followed by measuring its flat-band potential (Efb) via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. First, the energy band gap (Eg) of the photoanode can be obtained using its absorption coefficient (α) and the incident photon energy (hν) in eqn (5)66 and the α value of a photoanode can be calculated via its absorption and transmittance spectra (Fig. 3a and b) using the Manifacier model as eqn (6).66,67 (αhν) ∝ (hν − Eg)1/2(5) (6)where A is the absorption and T is the transmittance of the film. According to the plot of (αhν)2versus hv, as shown in Fig. 7a, the value of Eg of a photoanode can be determined by extrapolating the tangent line of the plot to (αhν)2 = 0. Table 1 shows that the Eg values of various TiN/TiO2 composite films range from 2.88 to 3.18 eV for different annealing periods. The Eg values of TiN/TiO2-4h and P25 are 3.18 and 3.20 eV, respectively, which agree well with the Eg of pure TiO2.67 It can be observed that the higher TiN content in the films leads to the lower Eg value, because the higher TiN content provides the more visible light absorption, better conductivity, and more efficient photoelectron–hole separation.20,21 For a DSSC, the lower Eg value indicates the better conductivity of the photoanode, and causes the higher FF value of the DSSC. As for water splitting, the lower Eg value indicates the more efficient photoelectron–hole separation, and gives the higher Jpho values of TiN/TiO2 composite films than that of P25 film.

Second, the Efb value of a photoanode can be read from the Mott–Schottky plots of corresponding electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). The Mott–Schottky plots can be obtained by plotting the reciprocal of the root of the capacitance (C−2) versus the applied voltage (E). At a high frequency of 10 kHz, the equivalent circuit of a semiconductor/electrolyte interface can be simplified to a resistance–capacitance (RC) circuit, and the Efb of a photoanode can be determined from the slope and intercept of the fitting line of its Mott–Schottky plot, using the Mott–Schottky equation68 (eqn (7)). (7)where k is Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, C is the capacitance of the space-charge of the film, ε is the dielectric constant of the film, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, A is the surface area of the film (1 cm2), ND is the charge density of the film, q is its electric charge, E is the applied voltage, and Efb is the flat-band potential of the film.
In Fig. 7b, the slopes of Mott–Schottky plots of all photoanodes are positive, which confirms that all photoanodes are n-type semiconductors in this study. As summarized in Table 1, the Efb values of the photoanodes are in the range of −0.33 to 0.51 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). The more the TiN content in a photoanode, the more negative Efb value can be observed. For a DSSC, the more negative Efb value causes larger difference between the Fermi level of the photoanode and the redox potential of I−/I3−, such that the VOC value of the DSSC enlarges. For water splitting, the more negative Efb value provides larger driving force to trigger the H2O redox. It can be further explained by the energy band diagram (Fig. 8) of all photoanodes, which is determined using the corresponding Eg, Efb, conduction band potential (Ec), and valance band potential (Ev) values of the films. Based on the previous report,69 the Ec value of a photoanode can be calculated from its electron concentration and Efb value, and the Ev value is extracted from the Ec and Eg value accordingly. In Fig. 8, the more negative Efb values indicate more negative Ec values of the TiN/TiO2 composite photoanodes. Considering the E0 for H2 production in eqn (3), more negative Ec values of the TiN/TiO2 composite films indicate larger driving forces in favor of water splitting, compared to that of P25 film. This explains the higher Jpho value in favor of TiN/TiO2-1h, compared to that of P25, under visible light irradiation.

Conclusions
Titanium nitride/titanium oxide (TiN/TiO2) composite photoanodes have been explored for the use in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as well as in water splitting. The efficient TiN/TiO2 composite films possess good uniformity and high porous structure using a home-made POEM dispersant in a simple doctor blade procedure followed by a post-annealing treatment. By applying thermal treatment at 500 °C for different periods, TiN cubic crystalline in the TiN precursor films could be partially converted to two tetragonal TiO2 crystalline, anatase and rutile phases, simultaneously. The TiN/TiO2 composite films containing both TiN and TiO2 crystallines are applied as the photoanodes for the DSSCs or for water splitting separately. Composite films with higher content of TiN show higher absorption of visible light. Moreover, we investigate several key characteristics to determine the performance for both applications, i.e., the conductivity, visible light absorption, energy band gap, or flat-band potential of the films. In the case of DSSCs, an increase in the TiN content in the photoanode leads to increase in the values of VOC and FF and a decrease in the value of JSC. The increase in the value of VOC is attributed to a shift in the flat-band potential to a more negative value, the increase in the value of FF is apparently due to the higher conductivity of the film, and the decrease in the JSC value is owing to lesser dye loading caused by lesser content of TiO2 at a shorter period of annealing. Dark current densities behavior, charge recombination resistance (Rrec) values, and electron life time (τe) values are used to verify the VOC values. Dye loading data, IPCE, and charge transfer resistance (Rct) values are used to explain the JSC values of the cells. The best DSSC with TiN/TiO2 composite photoanode annealed for 1 h (TiN/TiO2-1h) exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 7.27%, while the cell without TiN, i.e., the cell with a P25 photoanode, shows an efficiency of 7.02%. In the case of water splitting, we find that the higher TiN content in a photoanode possesses the more negative flat-band potential for better triggering the H2O redox, but the less photo-induced current response at UV light illumination. Therefore, considering the water splitting performance measured at AM 1.5G, the TiN/TiO2-1h composite photoanode shows the best photo-induced current density (Jpho) of 0.12 mA cm−2, compared to that of the P25 film. An energy band diagram reveals a higher driving force for water splitting in favor of TiN/TiO2-1h film, compared to that in favor of P25 film. This explains the higher Jpho value in favor of TiN/TiO2-1h film, compared to that of P25 film, under visible light irradiation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report detailing the achievement of the highest DSSCs and water splitting performance by applying the highly efficient TiN/TiO2 composite photoanodes separately. We, therefore, conclude that both dye-sensitized solar cells and water splitting electrochemical devices would independently achieve their best performance when the TiN/TiO2 composite photoanode is annealed for 1 h.
