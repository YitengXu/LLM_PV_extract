    , Accepted 15th February 2012First published on 9th March 2012AbstractSemiconductor based nanocomposites are quite promising in the areas of photocatalysis and photovoltaics due to their efficient charge separation. Herein, we demonstrated a simple and green one-step method to prepare novel Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs (titanate nanotubes) nanocomposites with low-priced metallic elements. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed that an enwrapped architecture was achieved for Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs nanocomposites. Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles of ca. 90 nm were tightly surrounded by the network of titanate nanotubes, which led to the high dispersity of Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles and the intimate multipoint contacts between Cd0.5Zn0.5S and TNTs. Highly efficient charge separation was finally achieved in the hybrid Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs through the enwrapped structure. Under visible light irradiation Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs displayed improved activities compared to the single Cd0.5Zn0.5S for hydrogen evolution. The effect of sacrificial reagents on the photocatalytic activity of Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs was discussed. The highest apparent quantum yield of 38.1% at 420 nm was achieved. This value is among the highest efficiencies for the noble-metal free photocatalysts ever reported. Meanwhile, Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs showed good stability for hydrogen production, and the content of toxic cadmium was as low as 4.0 wt% of the nanocomposites. These factors are of great significance for their application in the field of solar energy conversion.
1. Introduction
Since Fujishima and Honda first demonstrated direct photoelectrochemical water splitting on a TiO2 electrode in 1972,1 photocatalytic hydrogen production from water has attracted substantial attention as a promising route for the conversion and storage of solar energy.2–4 From the perspective of industrial application, the photocatalysts should have high efficiency, good stability, low price and low toxicity. These factors provide a general guide to developing effective photocatalysts for hydrogen production. CdS photocatalysts, with the visible light response, has been extensively studied for hydrogen evolution from water.5–9 However, the relatively low activity of pure CdS, the problem of photocorrosion and the toxicity of cadmium are the restrictions to its wide application.10 Combining CdS with the wide bandgap semiconductor ZnS to form the solid solution Cd1−xZnxS is demonstrated to be an effective way to improve the activity. By adjusting the value of x, the conduction band position and the bandgap of Cd1−xZnxS can be modified to well satisfy the requirement of the photocatalytic reaction. So the efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production is achieved over Cd1−xZnxS photocatalyst even without cocatalyst loaded.11–14
However, even for the efficient Cd1−xZnxS photocatalysts with appropriate bandgap and conduction band position, the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in semiconductors is still a main issue limiting the further enhancement of photocatalytic efficiency. Coupling semiconductors with different energy levels to form hybrid photocatalysts has been demonstrated to be useful to achieve the effective charge separation for higher activity and improved photostability.15–18 For example, in a CdS/TiO2 composite system, under visible light irradiation photoexcited electrons can transfer from CdS to the conduction band of TiO2, while the holes would remain in the valance band of CdS.19 If Cd1−xZnxS are combined with another suitable semiconductor, this kind of charge separation can be also expected. Meanwhile, it is also hoped that only low amount of toxic cadmium is needed for these hybrid photocatalysts, which will be important from the environmental point of view. Sato's group has reported a series of Cd1−xZnxS coupled with layered compounds nanocomposites, which displayed enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production compared to the component materials.20–22 However, other nanocomposites of Cd1−xZnxS for photocatalytic hydrogen production have been seldom investigated afterwards, probably because the proper coupled semiconductor for Cd1−xZnxS and efficient architecture of the nanocomposites cannot be easily attained. Thus, development of the delicate Cd1−xZnxS based composite photocatalysts with much higher activities and good stability is quite necessary.
In our recent study, CdS/TNTs (titanate nanotubes) nanocomposites with a unique enwrapped structure were developed for efficient hydrogen evolution, and much higher activity was achieved compared to the previous CdS coupled TNTs photocatalysts.23 TNTs were important to the efficient hydrogen evolution due to their distinguishing features (e.g., suitable conduction band position, one-dimension nanostructure and large surface area).24–26 The unique enwrapped architecture was crucial for the enhanced activity, because it led to significant enhancement of charge separation. However, the obtained CdS/TNTs only showed good activity with precious Pt loaded. And the systematic investigations of composite photocatalysts and photocatalytic reaction were not conducted in our previous research. Herein, we applied the simple and green one-step hydrothermal route for the synthesis of Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs hybrid photocatalysts with low price (the annual production and price of different metallic elements were shown in Table S1 of ESI†). The enwrapped architecture was successfully prepared for Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs nanocomposites. The detailed characterization and the electronic interaction between Cd0.5Zn0.5S and TNTs were discussed. The composite photocatalysts showed much higher activity compared to the single Cd0.5Zn0.5S. With the optimization of sacrificial reagents, significantly high efficiency was achieved without any cocatalyst. Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs nanocomposites also showed good photostability, and quite low cadmium was used in the nanocomposites.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis
All chemicals were used as received without any purification. Titanium dioxide (TiO2), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), cadmium acetate (Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O), zinc acetate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O), thioacetamide (C2H5NS), and ethanol (C2H6O) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.
Titanate nanotubes were prepared according to a reported method with some modifications.27 Rutile TiO2 (1 g) was first added into 10 M NaOH solution (50 mL). The suspension was then stirred uniformly and heated for 48 h at 150 °C in a Teflon-lined autoclave. After the autoclave cooled naturally in air, the products were achieved, which were finally washed with deionized water several times and dried in vacuum at 70 °C for 5h.
Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs nanocomposites were synthesized by the one-step hydrothermal method following the procedure below. Rutile TiO2 (1 g) was first added into 10 M NaOH solution (50 mL). The suspension was stirred uniformly, and appropriate amounts of Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O, Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O and thioacetamide were subsequently added with stirring (Cd/Zn molar ratio is 1.0, and Cd/Ti molar ratio is 0.05). The obtained suspension was then heated for 48 h at 150 °C in a Teflon-lined autoclave. After the autoclave cooled naturally in air, the products were achieved, which were washed with ethanol and deionized water several times and dried in vacuum at 70 °C for 5 h. Single Cd0.5Zn0.5S was also hydrothermally synthesized according to the same process for Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs except that no TiO2 was added.
2.2 Characterization
The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of photocatalysts were obtained on a PANalytical X'pert MPD Pro X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu-Kα irradiation. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained at a liquid nitrogen temperature (−196 °C) with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 nitrogen adsorption apparatus. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) approach using adsorption data over a relative pressure was employed to determine the specific surface area. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) approach was used for calculating the average pore size and pore size distribution using desorption data. Elemental analysis was conducted on a Bruker S4 PIONEER X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer, using a Ru target and a 4 kW maximum power. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were captured on a JEOL 2010 microscope using copper mounted lacey carbon grids. A Raman scattering study was performed on a Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR spectrometer using 514.5 nm irradiation from an argon ion laser at 20 mW. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the photocatalysts were measured on a HITACHI U-4100 spectrophotometer. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a Axis Ultra, Kratos (UK) multifunctional spectrometer using monochromatic Al Kα radiation. Binding energies were calibrated relative to the C 1s peak (284.8 eV) from adventitious carbon adsorbed on the surface of the samples.
2.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen production
Photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light irradiation was performed in a side irradiation Pyrex cell with stirring. The efficient irradiation area for the cell was 15.90 cm2. Aqueous solution (190 mL) containing photocatalyst (0.2 g) and Na2SO3/Na2S as sacrificial reagents was added. Nitrogen was purged through the cell before reaction to remove oxygen. The temperature for all reactions was kept at 35 ± 0.2 °C. A 500 W Xe lamp equipped with a cutoff filter (λ ≥ 430 nm) was used as the light source, and the irradiation power after the filter was measured to be 55 mW cm−2. The amount of hydrogen was detected by an on-line TCD gas chromatograph (NaX zeolite column, N2 as carrier gas). The blank experiments showed no appreciable hydrogen evolution in the absence of irradiation or photocatalyst. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) was calculated by the eqn (1). A 420 nm band-pass filter and a fiber optic spectrometer were used in measurement. (1)
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Formation of Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs nanocomposites with the enwrapped structure

Fig. 1 shows the TEM images of the single TNTs and the hybrid Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs. Titanate nanotubes (Fig. 1a) present uniform distribution with an average outer diameter of ∼10 nm and an average inner diameter of ∼4 nm. The walls of the nanotubes display a multilayer structure and both of the tube ends are open, in accordance with the literature.26Fig. 1b reveals that TNTs and Cd0.5Zn0.5S have been successfully synthesized in Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs via the one-step hydrothermal process. Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles of ca. 90 nm are well dispersed and tightly enwrapped by the network of titanate nanotubes in the nanocomposites (Fig. 1c). This architecture of the hybrid Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs successfully avoids the agglomeration of Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles and finally leads to the intimate multipoint contacts between the Cd0.5Zn0.5S primary particle and the surrounding titanate nanotubes (Fig. 1d). It is indicated that during the one-step hydrothermal process Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles nucleated and grew. At the same time, titanate nanotubes could be obtained by transformation of TiO2 nanoparticles, and some titanate nanotubes would be developed along the Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticle. Hence, Cd0.5Zn0.5S and TNTs well accreted in the hydrothermal process and the enwrapped architecture of Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs was achieved.

XRD was used to identify and determine the phase structures of the prepared samples (Fig. 2). The XRD traces of single TNTs are similar to those of alkali or hydrogen titanates, which exhibited an orthorhombic structure.28,29 The diffraction peak of TNTs, observed at around 10.0°, corresponds to the interlayer separation of 0.8 nm in the nano walls.27 The XRD pattern of the reference Cd0.5Zn0.5S is somewhat complicated and further analysis reveals that Cd0.5Zn0.5S exhibits both cubic phase and hexagonal phase. There are no XRD peaks assigned to pure CdS or ZnS.11 The diffraction peaks assigned to TNTs and Cd0.5Zn0.5S can be both observed in the XRD pattern of Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs nanocomposites, indicating the successful synthesis of the crystalline titanate nanotubes and Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles. However, the peaks of Cd0.5Zn0.5S are weak, probably due to its low amount in the nanocomposites (8.7 wt% determined by XRF analysis). The low amount of cadmium (as low as 4.0 wt% of the nanocomposites) is of great meaning for the application of the photocatalysts because of its toxicity.

In order to further investigate the microstructure of crystalline materials, Raman spectra of as-synthesized samples excited at 514.5 nm (2.41 eV) are displayed in Fig. 3. TNTs exhibit typical Raman peaks at 275, 447, 610 and 902 cm−1. The 447 cm−1 peak is assigned to Ti–O–Ti vibrations. The 275 and 610 cm−1 peaks are due to Ti–O–M vibrations (M = Na and H), and the 902 cm−1 peak results from four-coordinate Ti–O involving non-bridging oxygen atoms coordinated by the M ion.30,31 The Raman spectrum of the reference Cd0.5Zn0.5S is similar to that of CdS.6 The Raman peaks at 310 cm−1 and 620 cm−1 are respectively attributed to 1 LO (longitudinal optical) and 2 LO phonon modes of Cd0.5Zn0.5S. However, compared to the peaks of CdS (300 nm and 600 nm), they shift to higher wavenumbers due to the component Zinc. In addition, no peaks of pure ZnS or CdS can be seen in the Raman spectrum of Cd0.5Zn0.5S.32,33 The typical peaks of Cd0.5Zn0.5S and TNTs were found in the Raman spectrum of Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs nanocomposites. Since the excitation laser energy is close to the bandgap of Cd0.5Zn0.5S (2.57 eV, shown in Fig. 6), Strong resonance effect for the Cd0.5Zn0.5S phase occurred, leading to the intense signals of Cd0.5Zn0.5S.34 The Raman peaks of TNTs in Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs will be thus affected and become quite weak. As shown in Fig. 3, only a very weak Raman peak for TNTs at 447 cm−1 appears in the spectrum of Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs.

Fig. 4 shows the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of TNTs and Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs, where the hysteresis loops indicate the presence of mesopores.35,36 The corresponding BJH pore-size distribution is displayed in the inset of Fig. 4. Two peaks for TNTs are discovered. One is at 3.4 nm corresponding to the inner diameter of nanotubes, and the other is at 14.8 nm probably due to the aggregation of nanotubes.25 The pore-size distribution of Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs is similar to that of TNTs, and two typical peaks also appear at around 3.4 nm and 14.8 nm. However, the peak at 3.4 nm is much weaker than that for TNTs, and the pore-size distribution during 2∼3.4 nm is higher than that for TNTs. This phenomenon can imply that the inner diameter of nanotubes in Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs is a little smaller than that in the single TNTs. The BET surface areas of TNTs, Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs and Cd0.5Zn0.5S are respectively 103, 87 and 32 m2 g−1. When the composite photocatalysts are excited by the visible light (as illustrated in Fig. 8), photogenerated electrons of Cd0.5Zn0.5S will transfer to the conduction band of TNTs. So the large surface area of TNTs will provide abundant active sites for the efficient interface reaction.

3.2 Chemical composition, electronic interaction and optical properties
XPS was carried out to determine the surface chemical compositions and electronic state of the as-prepared samples. The XPS survey spectrum of Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs, as presented in Fig. 5 (a), confirms the existence of Cd, Zn, S, Ti, O, Na and C in the composite sample, which indicates the successful synthesis of Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs nanocomposites. The strong Na peak is coming from titanate nanotubes.28 The C peak may originate from absorbed gaseous molecules and contaminations caused by air exposure. The actual content of Cd0.5Zn0.5S in Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs was determined to be 8.7 wt% by XRF analysis, which is a useful tool to confirm the sample compositions. Fig. 5 (b–d) respectively shows the comparisons of the high-resolution XPS spectra of Cd 3d, Zn 2p, and S 2p for Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs and Cd0.5Zn0.5S. The different curves corresponding to Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs and Cd0.5Zn0.5S match well in the three figures, indicating that the valence state of Cd0.5Zn0.5S didn't change by coupling with TNTs. However, slight binding energy shifts of Cd 3d, Zn 2p, and S 2p for Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs can be observed in contrast to the single Cd0.5Zn0.5S. It is considered that these binding energy shifts for Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs derived from the electronic interaction between Cd0.5Zn0.5S and the surrounding TNTs,37 which was caused by the intimate multipoint contacts revealed in TEM images.

UV-vis absorption spectra of Cd0.5Zn0.5S, Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs and TNTs are shown in Fig. 6. The absorption edge of pure TNTs is only located at 370 nm, while Cd0.5Zn0.5S exhibits the sharp absorption edge at around 520 nm. In the absorption spectrum of Cd0.5Zn0.5S, there is no typical absorption edge of ZnS (ca. 350 nm) or CdS (ca. 560 nm). The absorption spectrum of Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs consists of the characteristic spectra of TNTs and Cd0.5Zn0.5S. Further observation reveals that the absorption edge of Cd0.5Zn0.5S in Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs composites is blue-shifted compared to that of the reference Cd0.5Zn0.5S, indicating the larger bandgap of Cd0.5Zn0.5S in Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs. The accurate optical bandgap of Cd0.5Zn0.5S can be estimated from the tangent line in the plot of [F(R∞) hν]2versus photon energy hν, where F(R∞) is the Kubelka–Munk function.38 As shown in the inset of Fig. 6, the bandgaps of Cd0.5Zn0.5S in Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs and the reference Cd0.5Zn0.5S are respectively 2.57 eV and 2.50 eV. The similar blue shifts of CdS absorption edge have been reported for CdS-SiO2,39 CdS/TiO219 and CdS/TNTs23 nanocomposites, where the shifts were attributed to an electronic interaction between the two different components through the formation of chemical bonds. Therefore, it can be inferred that the blue-shift absorption edge of Cd0.5Zn0.5S in Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs should derive from the similar electronic interaction between Cd0.5Zn0.5S and TNTs, which can be identified by the XPS results.

3.3 Comparison of the photocatalytic activities
Photocatalytic performances of as-prepared samples are illustrated in Fig. 7. The photocatalytic activity of the mixture of Cd0.5Zn0.5S and TNTs by mechanical milling (labelled as Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs-m) was also investigated for comparison. The content of Cd0.5Zn0.5S in Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs-m was controlled to be 8.7 wt%, which was the same as that in Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs. As shown in Fig. 7a, Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs nanocomposites displayed the highest photocatalytic activity. The hydrogen production rate over Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs was 230.1 μmol h−1 without loading any cocatalyst. Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs-m displayed lower activity than the reference Cd0.5Zn0.5S, probably due to its low content of Cd0.5Zn0.5S. The photocatalytic hydrogen rate of Cd0.5Zn0.5S seemed to be slightly decreased after 4 h of reaction time, indicating its instability.
 Fig. 7  Photocatalytic hydrogen production over Cd0.5Zn0.5S, Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs and Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNT-m (a). Comparison of the photocatalytic hydrogen rates of all samples corresponding to the unit gram of Cd0.5Zn0.5S (b). Reaction conditions: 0.2 g of catalyst; 190 mL of aqueous solution containing 0.25 M Na2SO3/0.35 M Na2S; 500 W Xe lamp equipped with a cutoff filter (λ ≥ 430 nm). 
In order to eliminate the influence of Cd0.5Zn0.5S amount and further discuss the photocatalytic activities, comparison of the photocatalytic hydrogen rates of all samples corresponding to the unit gram of Cd0.5Zn0.5S was given in Fig. 7b. Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs and Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs-m showed higher activities than Cd0.5Zn0.5S, indicating that TNTs played a significant role on the improved activities of composite photocatalysts. As previously reported, photogenerated electrons in CdS nanoparticles can transfer to the conduction band of TNTs for the hybrid CdS/TNTs, leading to the efficient charge separation.23 This kind of charge separation can be expected for Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs and Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs-m, since the conduction band of Cd0.5Zn0.5S is more negative than that of CdS.11–14 The comparison of different band positions of Cd0.5Zn0.5S, CdS and TNTs was shown in Fig. 1S of ESI†. Meanwhile, the large surface area of TNTs can enhance the adsorption of H2O molecules and offer more active sites for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Hence, the composite photocatalysts showed much higher activities corresponding to the unit gram of Cd0.5Zn0.5S. The hydrogen production rate of Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs was 13.2 mmol h−1 g−1CdZnS, which was about 13 times higher than that of the reference Cd0.5Zn0.5S. Furthermore, Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs displayed much higher activity than Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs-m. As the content of Cd0.5Zn0.5S was the same, the higher hydrogen production can be ascribed to the more efficient charge separation induced by the enwrapped structure in Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs.
As depicted in Fig. 1, an enwrapped architecture for the hybrid Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs is achieved. Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles are tightly surrounded by the network of titanate nanotubes, which successfully prevents the agglomeration of Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles. The intergranular boundaries of Cd0.5Zn0.5S, which can act as the recombination centres of photogenerated charges, are thus eliminated. Therefore, the surface of Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles can be highly utilized for reaction. Since Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs-m is the mechanical mixture of Cd0.5Zn0.5S and TNTs, the agglomeration of Cd0.5Zn0.5S cannot be avoided. When Cd0.5Zn0.5S is excited by the visible light, parts of the photogenerated charges will recombine at the intergranular boundaries, leading to the low efficiency of charge separation in Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs-m.
It was reported that the contacts between the different components should be intimate so as to facilitate the efficient charge transfer in the hybrid photocatalysts.37 Compared to the Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs-m sample by mechanical milling, Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs is prepared via a one-step hydrothermal process. Cd0.5Zn0.5S and TNTs accrete with each other under relatively high temperature and pressure. The intergrowth effects in Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs lead to a strong lattice contacts between Cd0.5Zn0.5S and TNTs,40 which can be confirmed by the TEM observation. Furthermore, the electronic interaction between the two different phases in Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs can be detected by our XPS and UV-vis analysis, which also demonstrate the intimate lattice contacts in Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs.
According to the above discussion, the entire photocatalytic process over the hybrid Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs samples can be illustrated in Fig. 8. Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanocrystals, upon excitation with visible light, generate electrons and holes. The photoexcited electrons are subsequently injected into the surrounding titanate nanotubes through the intimate multipoint contacts, and the photoexcited holes will stay in Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanocrystals. The multipoint contacts provide more paths to transfer the photogenerated electrons, accelerating the efficient charge separation. Finally, the photoexcited holes react with the sacrificial agents, and the received electrons in TNTs reduce the H+ in the water to generate hydrogen efficiently. The enwrapped architecture of Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs results in the high dispersity of Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles and the intimate multipoint contacts between the different phases. The high dispersity of Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles can eliminate the intergranular boundaries, reducing the recombination centres in Cd0.5Zn0.5S. The surface of Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles is thus highly utilized for the reaction. The intimate multipoint contacts between Cd0.5Zn0.5S and TNTs facilitate the efficient transfer of photogenerated electrons. Moreover, the large surface area of TNTs can enhance the adsorption of H2O molecules and offer abundant active sites for the interface reaction. These factors ultimately lead to the more efficient charge separation and much enhanced photocatalytic activity for Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs.

3.4 Effect of the sacrificial reagents on the photocatalytic activity
For a photocatalytic reaction, there are typically three steps. The semiconductors are irradiated by light, and generate electrons and holes; the photoexcited charges are separated and transferred to the surface of semiconductors; photogenerated electrons and holes respectively react with the absorbed hydrogen ion and sacrificial reagents at the semiconductor surface. For our Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs nanocomposites, Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles were applied to absorb visible light, and efficient charge separation was achieved due to the enwrapped structure of nanocomposites. Therefore, the first two steps of the photocatalytic reaction were optimized in our system. Then it is expected that further improvement of the activity can be obtained through the optimization of the final step of surface reaction. It is reported that the photocatalytic activity for water splitting is mainly restricted by the oxidizing half reaction (photogenerated holes oxidizing OH− to produce O2).41 In order to promote the reducing half reaction (photogenerated electrons reducing H+ to produce H2), sacrificial reagents are often added to react with photogenerated holes.4 Na2SO3 and Na2S are used as the sacrificial reagents in our system, which can be produced from the industrial waste gas SO2 and H2S. The detailed reactions between the photogenerated holes and sacrificial reagents can be illustrated by the following equations:42,43 SO2−3 + H2O + 2h+ → SO2−4 + 2H+(2) 2S2− + 2h+ → S2−2(3) S2−2 + SO2−3 → S2O2−3 + S2−(4)
As shown in Fig. 9, the effect of the concentration of sacrificial reagents on the hydrogen production rate was investigated for Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs nanocomposites. With the increased concentration of sacrificial reagents, the hydrogen production rate was gradually improved. Especially, there is an approximate linear relationship between the activity and the concentration of sacrificial reagents in our study. The nanocomposites showed a highest rate of 347.7μmol h−1, with the apparent quantum yield of 38.1% at 420 nm. This value is among the highest efficiencies for the noble-metal free photocatalysts ever reported (Table S2 of ESI†).14,44–48 Further increasing the amount of sacrificial reagents hardly improved the activity, because some bulk Na2S could not be dissolved beyond the concentration of 0.75 M Na2SO3/1.05 M Na2S.49 It is considered that with the increased concentration of sacrificial reagents in the reacting solution, more S2− and SO32− ions could be absorbed at the surfaces of Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles, leading to the acceleration of the oxidizing reaction of sacrificial reagents. Meanwhile, the reducing half reaction was improved due to the electric neutrality of the nanocomposites, resulting in the enhancement of the hydrogen production rate. With the increased sacrificial regents, the solution pH slightly increased (Fig. 2S in ESI†). The hydrogen production was expected to be suppressed in the high alkaline solution due to the decreased concentration of protons. However, the improved activity was achieved with the increased sacrificial reagents, which indicated that the effective concentration of S2− and SO32− ions, not the solution pH, was the determining factor for the hydrogen production.

The abscissa denotes the multiple of used sacrificial reagent concentration compared to 0.25 M Na2SO3/0.35 M Na2S. For example, when the abscissa was 2.0, 0.50 M Na2SO3/0.70 M Na2S were used. Reaction conditions: 0.2 g of catalyst; 190 mL of aqueous solution containing Na2SO3/Na2S; 500 W Xe lamp equipped with a cutoff filter (λ ≥ 430 nm). 
3.5 Stability test

Fig. 10 shows the stability test of Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs samples for hydrogen production. The photocatalytic activities were firstly investigated for continuous 6 days. Each day the samples were irradiated for 12 h and then stored overnight. After every 24 h of reaction time, the photocatalysts were centrifuged and dispersed in the new reaction solution with fresh sacrificial reagents. We found that after the first 12 h of the reaction and the overnight storage, the activity of the sample dropped by about 20% during the second day's reaction. However, when the reaction solution was replaced by a new one, the activity was recovered in the third day. Similar results were also discovered for the next three days' photocatalytic reaction. This decreasing-recovering phenomenon indicated that the Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs photocatalysts were stable during the continuous 6 days' reaction. The decreased activity could be ascribed to the reduced concentration of sacrificial reagents and the probable coverage of active sites by the reaction products during the overnight storage. After 6 days' testing, the samples were stored for 3 days without reaction and then resumed for additional 12 h of reaction time. A similar activity was obtained as for the initial 12 h one, which implied that even after several days' storage Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs photocatalysts could still exhibited substantial activity.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs nanocomposites were prepared by a simple and green one-step method for efficient hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. It was found that the hybrid Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs owned an enwrapped architecture. Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles of ca. 90 nm were tightly surrounded by the network of titanate nanotubes in the composites. This enwrapped structure led to the high dispersity of Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles and the intimate multipoint contacts between Cd0.5Zn0.5S and TNTs, which were crucial for the more efficient charge separation. The large surface area of TNTs can enhance the adsorption of H2O molecules and offer abundant active sites for photocatalytic reactions. Accordingly, Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs displayed much higher activities compared to the single Cd0.5Zn0.5S. Na2SO3 and Na2S were used as the sacrificial reagents in our system, which can be produced from the industrial waste gas SO2 and H2S. With the optimization of sacrificial reagents, the hydrogen evolution rate could reach 347.7 μmol h−1, showing the apparent quantum yield as high as 38.1% at 420 nm. Good stability was also proved for Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs, and the content of toxic cadmium was only 4.0 wt% of the nanocomposites. Meanwhile, the photocatalysts only contain the abundant and low-priced metallic elements. These advantages make Cd0.5Zn0.5S/TNTs nanocomposites attractive for further study and application.
