Via density functional theory computation and experimental validation, we have compared the catalytic activities of different facets within Bi2S3, as counter-electrode (CE) materials for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The (130) facet has the largest surface energy, the best electronic conductivity, and the highest position of conduction band minima, indicating the most effective electron transfer from CEs to I−3 and the highest catalytic activities of Bi2S3 with (130) facets. To testify the computations, we also synthesized flower-like Bi2S3 nanostructures with dominantly exposed (130) and (211) facets, respectively, and investigated their catalytic activities through impedance spectra, I–V curves and conversion efficiency tests. DSSCs with (130) and (211) faceted Bi2S3 CEs exhibited conversion efficiencies of 3.5% and 1.9%, respectively, which further confirmed the superiority of (130) facets within Bi2S3. The findings provide some clues for designing and applying low-cost Pt-free DSSC CE materials from inorganic nanostructures.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) comprise a dye-sensitized nanocrystalline semiconductor electrode (TiO2), an electrolyte with a redox couple (triiodide/iodide), and a counter electrode, in which triiodide is reduced to iodide by the electrons flowing through the external circuit.1 Small cells can reach over 10% efficiency,2 endure more than 1000 hours of accelerated aging at 80 °C in the dark and continuous illumination of 1000 W m−2 visible light at 60 °C with negligible or only minor performance degradation. Due to their low cost, environmentally friendliness, and simple preparation procedure, as well as long-term stability under thermal and light-soaking stress, DSSCs have shown great commercial potential.3 Recently, extensive studies on the individual components of DSSCs have been performed to further reduce production costs and to achieve better cell performance.4–10 The counter electrode (CE) is one of the most important and indispensable components of DSSCs.11 Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass loaded with noble metal platinum is commonly used as the CE, because Pt exhibits high electrocatalytic activity for triiodide reduction. However, in view of the scarce Pt source, inorganic materials showing electrocatalytic activity in reducing triiodide (e.g., CoS and TiN) have also been applied as an alternative catalytic material for the CE.12
Currently, the controlled morphosynthesis in inorganic nanomaterial fabrication has attracted considerable attention for generating new materials with controllable hierarchical structures and then fabricating functional devices.13,14 In particular, nanostructured materials with complex morphologies analogous to biominerals,14 especially curved three-dimensional (3D) microspheres, have shown promises in catalysis,15–17 Li-ion batteries,18 water treatment,19 wettability,20–22etc. Furthermore, crystal-facet-controlled fabrication of semiconductor materials has recently attracted much interest because their photoelectric and photocatalytic properties can be further enhanced or optimized by tailoring the surface atomic structures.23–26 For example, the {001} facets of anatase TiO2 are much more reactive than the thermodynamically stable {101} facets for the production of H2 from water splitting.27 The {110} facets of Ag3PO4 exhibit a higher surface energy than the {100} facets, and Ag3PO4 {110} facets contribute significantly to the enhanced photocatalytic activity.28 The combination of morphosynthesis of 3D microspheres and crystal-facet-controlled fabrication proves a viable way to optimize the electrocatalytic activities of CEs. Although metal oxide,18,19,29–38 sulfide,15–17,39 and metal15–17 3D microspheres with solid or hollow interiors have been prepared, the precise morphology control of 3D microspheres with crystal-facet-control is still a big challenge.
Herein, we report the fabrication of morphological and facet-controlled Bi2S3 microspheres with nanowire assembly, as a promising and efficient method for the further improvement of the catalytic performance of CEs. In the present work, we first investigated the structural and electronic properties of Bi2S3 facets through the periodic density functional theory (DFT) computations by employing a slab model, and then synthesized Bi2S3 with different facets via controlled experimental approaches. We demonstrated that the catalytic activity of Bi2S3 was facet-dependent. The results show that single crystal Bi2S3 with exposed highly reactive facets can be a low-cost substitution for Pt CEs.
2. Computational
Our periodic DFT computations were performed by using a plane wave basis set with the projector augmented plane wave (PAW)40,41 to model the ion–electron interaction as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).42 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the PW91 (ref. 43) functional and a 480 eV cutoff for the planewave basis set were adopted in all the computations. The tolerance for energy convergence was set to be 10−4 eV, while the ionic relaxation is converged when the forces on the atoms are smaller than 10−3 eV Å−1. The Brillouin zone was integrated by using Monkhorst-Pack generated sets of k-points. 5 × 5 × 5 k-point meshes, and 1 × 2 × 1 supercell with 16 Bi and 24 S atoms were benchmarked to be sufficient to reach the convergence for bulk computations. Band structures of bulk Bi2S3 were computed along the special lines connecting the following high-symmetry points: G (0, 0, 0), Z (0, 0, 0.5), T (0, 0.5, 0.5), Y (0, 0.5, 0), G (0, 0, 0), X (0.5, 0, 0), S (0.5, 0.5, 0), R (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and U (0.5, 0, 0.5) in the k-space.
The surface computations were performed by using the slab model, in which a finite number of crystal layers in a three dimensional periodic cell were used to generate two surfaces via the introduction of a vacuum gap perpendicular to the surface. The structure of Bi2S3 belongs to the orthorhombic space group Pnma (no. 62). In this work, the experimental values of lattice parameters were adopted as the starting points. Both the atomic positions and lattice constants were optimized for bulk Bi2S3. For the cleaved slab models, only the atomic positions were allowed to be relaxed. In this study, (040), (221), (130) and (211) surfaces were considered, as depicted in Fig. 1. The vacuum gap must be large enough that interactions between the periodic images perpendicular to the surface are negligible. The slab must also be of sufficient thickness that the structure in the middle of the slab is almost bulk-like. The surface energies computed in this work are converged to 10−4 J m−2 with respect to both the number of layers in the slab and the vacuum thickness, where a 15 Å vacuum gap was used throughout. Slabs with six atomic layers were utilized to simulate the (040) and (130) surface. Seven and ten atomic layer models were used to simulated the (221) and (211) surface, respectively. 2 × 2 × 1 k-point grid was used for the surface relaxation, with the third vector perpendicular to the surface, and the energy cut-off of the converged bulk computations (480 eV). On basis of full relaxed slabs, band structures were computed along the special lines connecting the following high-symmetry points: G (0, 0, 0), X (0.5, 0, 0), S (0.5, 0.5, 0) and Y (0, 0.5, 0) in the k-space.

3. Experimental
3.1 Synthesis
All chemicals were analytical grade and used as received without further purification. The Bi2S3 nanostructures were synthesized through a hydrothermal process. In a typical preparation of Bi2S3-211 (or Bi2S3-130) sample, 0.4 g thiocarbamide (or thiacetamide) and 0.4 g surfactant PVP 40000 were first dissolved in 40 ml distilled water, and then 0.3 g Bi2(NO3)3 was added slowly to the solution. The solution was stirred and sonicated for 10 min, until a white precipitate formed. Afterward, the precipitate was transferred to a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave, and the autoclave was filled with water to 80% of its total volume. The autoclave was then heated at 150 °C for 24 h and was allowed to cool to room temperature. The products in the autoclave were collected and washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol and then dried in the air and stored for further use.
3.2 Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed under an X-ray diffractometer (Model D/MAX2500, Rigaka) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). The morphology of the as-prepared products was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi-530, SEM/EDX JEOL JSM-6700F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2010, operating voltage of 200 kV) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai G2F-20). The elemental composition was detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra DLD).
3.3 Photovoltaic performance tests
Approximately 0.05 g of Bi2S3 powder was mixed with 0.5 ml 2.5% PEG20000 solution and stirred until a fluid mixture formed. A film was then made using the doctor-blade method on FTO conductive glass (LOF, TEC-15, 15 W per square). The film was heated at 450 °C for 1 h under the protection of argon to obtain the Bi2S3 counter electrode. A commercial TiO2 sol (Solaronix, Ti-Nanoxide T/SP) was used to prepare the TiO2 film on FTO also through the doctor-blade method, and the film was soaked in an N-719 dye solution (in ethanol) for 24 h to obtain dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes. DSSCs were assembled by injecting the electrolyte into the aperture between the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and the counter electrode. The liquid electrolyte composed of 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine with acetonitrile as the solvent. Surlyn 1702 was used as the spacer between the two electrodes. The two electrodes were clipped together and solid paraffin was used as the sealant to prevent the electrolyte solution from leaking. The effective cell area was 0.25 cm2. Photocurrent–voltage curves were measured with a Zahner IM6ex electrochemical workstation with a Trusttech CHF-XM-500W source under simulated sun illumination (Global AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2).
4. Results and discussion
4.1 Geometry properties and surface energies
Both the atomic positions and lattice constants of bulk Bi2S3 were optimized, and the result (a = 11.79 Å, b = 4.01 Å, c = 11.17 Å) agreed well with the previous study (a = 11.31 Å, b = 3.98 Å, c = 11.15 Å).44 After full relaxation of the atomic positions, there is a little inward and outward motion of the surface Bi and S atoms within slab models, respectively, as a result of the surface reconstruction. Meanwhile, the surface Bi (S) atoms, which are bonded to two S atoms (one Bi atom) at the unrelaxed slabs, are bonded to three S (two Bi) atoms within the optimized slabs.
As one of the key factors which determine the catalytic activity of Bi2S3 catalysts, the surface energy was firstly investigated. The standard method for calculating the surface energy, Esurf, is based on the general expression (1)where Enslab is the total energy of the slab, Ebulk is the total energy of the bulk per unit cell, n is the number of bulk unit cells contained in the slab, and A is the surface area of each side of the slab. When the number of bulk unit cell n becomes large enough and convergence is approached, Esurf can be calculated as follows: (2)
The evaluated surface energies of (040), (211), (221) and (130) facets were represented in Fig. 2. Obviously, due to the different surface reconstructions and configurations, (130) facet has the highest surface energy and the following sequence is (221) > (211) > (040), which indicates that the (130) facets within Bi2S3 crystals have higher catalytic activity than the other three investigated facets. Considering the surface activity, the (130) facet of Bi2S3 as a CE of DSSCs was highly recommended while the (040) facet was inadvisable.

4.2 Electronic properties
Because the electrical conductivity of CEs, which is affected by the carrier concentration, should highly impact its efficiency of electron transfer (to the I−3 in electrolyte), the electronic conductivity is another critical factor that influences the catalytic activity of CEs in DSSCs. To analyze the electronic properties, we computed the band structure of bulk Bi2S3 and all investigated facets. As shown in Fig. 3a, the bulk Bi2S3 has an indirect band gap (1.43 eV) with the conduction band minimum (CBM) at G point and the valence band maximum (VBM) at a general point along TY. In order to better understand the electronic structure of this material near the gap region, we computed the density of states (DOS) for bulk Bi2S3 and presented it in Fig. 3b. We found that Bi 6p states contribute primarily to the bottom of the conduction band while S 3p orbitals contribute to the top of the valence band. There is some hybridization between Bi 6s and S 3p orbitals at the VBM.
 Fig. 3  (a) is the band structure of bulk Bi2S3 (right) and its corresponding Brillouin zone (left); (b) represents DOS of bulk Bi2S3. The red dashed line represents the Fermi level at 0 eV. 
It is well known that the CBM of intrinsic semiconductor is unoccupied at the temperature of 0 K. Only when the surrounding temperature rose above absolute zero point, electrons would be thermodynamically excited from the valence band to the conduction band of the semiconductor and holes would be left in the valence band. Moreover, the carrier concentration, which predominantly determined the electronic conductivity of semiconductor, is in direct proportion to the temperature as well as inverse proportion to the band gap. At exactly the same temperature, the electronic conductivity of semiconductors increases with decreasing band gap. Accordingly, we compared the band gaps of the facets within Bi2S3 single crystal and demonstrated it in Fig. 4a. The (040) facet has the largest band gap, and the following sequence is (211) > (221) > (130). Considering the size effect, we have evaluated the thickness of the four investigated slabs. The slab models for the (130), (040), (221) and (211) facets have approximate thicknesses of 10.82 Å, 10.27 Å, 11.27 Å and 13.84 Å, respectively. Accordingly, their varied band gaps are not dependent on the size but the different surface configurations. Under the thermodynamic excitation, the carrier concentration of (130) facet is higher than those of other facets and thus the electronic conductivity of (130) is the highest. We also computed the energies of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of I−3 and the CBM of Bi2S3 facets, which are presented in Fig. 4b. We can see from Fig. 4b that the LUMO of I−3 is much lower than the CBM of Bi2S3 facets, which indicates that electrons can transfer from Bi2S3 facets to I−3 with ease.45,46 Significantly, the energy of CBM for (130) facets is above the other facets, resulting in more effective electron transfer.

4.3 Experimental validation
The assembled Bi2S3 flower-like nanostructures with dominantly exposed (130) and (211) facets, denoted as Bi2S3-130 and Bi2S3-211, respectively, were synthesized through a facile hydrothermal route, and the XRD patterns of the products, as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), are in good agreement with the standard data of orthorhombic Bi2S3 (JCPDS no. 17-0320). Compared with the relative strength shown in the standard pattern (Fig. 5(c)), the dominant 130 and 211 diffraction peak suggests that the as-synthesized products have a preferred orientation along the (130) and (211) plane, respectively, which was further demonstrated below by HRTEM.

Fig. 6(a) and (b) represent typical SEM images of the Bi2S3 products, which show that the products are composed of flower-like nanostructures. The HRTEM images are presented in Fig. 6(c)–(f). The fringe spacings of 0.199 nm and 0.230 nm agree well with the spacing of the (002) and (10) lattice planes of orthorhombic Bi2S3, indicating that the exposed (130) and (211) surfaces are perpendicular to (002) and (10) planes, respectively.

To validate the facet-dependent activity of the Bi2S3 CEs, we firstly characterized the impedance properties (Fig. 7(a)) of the investigated Bi2S3 nanostructure. Obviously, compared with Bi2S3-211, Bi2S3-130 has lower impedance, and thus better electrical conductivity, which agrees well with the computational result. The band structures have demonstrated that Bi2S3 with (130) facet has smaller band gap than that with (211) facet, implying better electrical conductivity of the former. A key parameter to evaluate the performance of DSSCs is the “open-circuit voltage” (Voc), since the external maximum power output for the cell is directly related to this value. The Voc is defined as the difference between the quasi-Fermi energy level, EqF, of TiO2 and the potential of the redox couple (I−/I−3). Accordingly, the Voc increases with the upshift of the TiO2 conduction band (CB) or the downshift of the I−/I−3 potential.45,47–50 With Bi2S3-130 and Bi2S3-211 as the counter-electrodes, the I–V curves of DSSCs were also measured and presented in Fig. 7(b). Bi2S3-130 has higher Voc than Bi2S3-211, which may result from the relative position of the TiO2 CB edge, the potential of redox couple and the band edge of Bi2S3-130. Significantly, due to the much higher surface energy, better electrical conductivity and higher position of the CBM, Bi2S3-130 is much more efficient than Bi2S3-211. Therefore, with respect to this flower-like Bi2S3 nanostructure, the (130) surface exposed nanocrystals are highly recommended for DSSC counter electrodes. DSSCs with Bi2S3-130 and Bi2S3-211 CEs annealed at 600 °C demonstrated by the best conversion efficiency of 3.5% and 1.9%, respectively, under AM 1.5 and 1 sun conditions. Although the power conversion efficiency was rather low; however, in this work we aimed to provide some clues for designing low-cost inorganic CE materials. The conversion efficiency can be further improved by adding graphene or carbon nanotubes to the electrodes so as to increase the electrical conductivity and improve the distribution of catalyst particles.

5. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have compared the catalytic activities of the (130), (211), (221) and (040) facets within Bi2S3, through DFT computation and experimental validation. Our computations suggest that the (130) facet within Bi2S3 has much higher surface energy, better electrical conductivity and relatively higher position of the CBM than all the other facets, which indicates the most effective electron transfer from Bi2S3-130 CEs to the I−3. To confirm the computational prediction, we also synthesized flower-like Bi2S3 nanostructures with dominantly exposed (130) and (211) facets and measured the impedance properties, I–V curves and conversion efficiencies. Bi2S3-130 had better electrical conductivity and higher open-circuit voltage than Bi2S3-211, which is in good agreement with our computational results. Significantly, DSSCs with Bi2S3-130 and Bi2S3-211 CEs demonstrated by the conversion efficiency of 3.5% and 1.9%, respectively, which also suggests the superiority of (130) facets within Bi2S3. These findings provide some clues for designing and applying Pt-free CE materials from inorganic nanostructures.
