    , Accepted 18th November 2015First published on 19th November 2015AbstractWe demonstrate the first systematic study of the diameter-dependent photoelectrochemical performance of single silicon nanowires within a broad size range from 200 to 2000 nm. SiNWs with a diameter of 1415 nm exhibit the highest solar energy conversion efficiency, which can be mainly traced to their diameter-dependent light absorption properties.
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) processes to harness solar energy and obtain clean fuels provide an emerging solution for climate, environment and energy issues, a key challenge of which is the design of efficient photoelectrodes.1,2 Silicon nanowires (SiNWs) have been proposed as promising photoelectrode materials due to their feasible large-area fabrication, narrow bandgap for broad light absorption and radial collection geometry for simultaneously optimized light absorption and carrier collection.2–5 Recently, the development of highly efficient SiNW-based photoelectrodes has been focused on the fabrication of heterogeneous structures and the discovery of new catalysts, in an attempt to improve the stability of SiNWs against oxidation, enhance broadband light absorption, and promote the kinetics of surface reactions.6,7 For example, SiNWs/hematite heterogeneous core/shell structures decorated with Au nanoparticles exhibited an excellent solar water splitting efficiency of up to 6%.7 Despite the rapid progress in the development of SiNW-based photoelectrodes, the improvement of PEC performance through structural engineering has rarely been achieved due to the very limited understanding of their structure–property relationship. Notably, it has been widely accepted that the diameter of SiNWs could greatly influence their light absorption ability and charge carrier collection efficiency, which are key factors in determining the PEC energy conversion efficiency.8–12 On the one hand, SiNWs with subwavelength diameters exhibit high absorption efficiencies (of up to 449%) in the near-UV and blue range (e.g. 300–500 nm) due to the resonance effect, but absorb weakly at longer wavelengths (e.g. 500–900 nm) because of their small extinction coefficient.8,9 With increased diameters, their absorption of light in the longer wavelength range can be improved at the expense of lower utilization of light in the UV and blue regions.8,9 On the other hand, SiNWs with small diameters benefit from the short diffusion distance for better radial carrier collection but, meanwhile, suffer from strong surface carrier recombination due to their increased specific surface areas.10–12 In other words, the diameter of SiNWs seems to have different yet contradicting effects on their PEC properties and, intuitively, an optimal diameter might exist to achieve the best PEC performance. Hence, a systematic study of their diameter-dependent PEC performance is not only of fundamental importance to better understand the structure–property relationship of SiNWs but also of technological significance to design highly efficient SiNW-based photoelectrodes through structural engineering.
Unfortunately, limited success has been achieved in the thorough understanding of the diameter effect of SiNWs on their PEC performance. There are only a few prior studies on the diameter-dependent PEC performance of SiNW arrays on the substrates, in which the effect of diameters was inevitably interfered with by the following factors: the existence of substrates, the pattern of the SiNWs assembly, array density and alignment, and the interaction between individual SiNWs.5,12 In addition, the diameters of SiNWs used in recent studies of their diameter-dependent properties usually fell into a very limited range, e.g. from 80 nm to 200 nm.12 To better understand their diameter-dependent properties, it is also necessary to study SiNWs in a broader diameter range. These limitations have hindered the progress in the optimization of the diameter of SiNWs for improving their performance in PEC energy conversion.
Different from SiNW arrays on the substrates, single SiNW-based photoelectrodes would provide an ideal platform for studying the diameter-dependent PEC performance without the interference from factors such as the substrates, the nanowire arrangement, and interactions between nanowires.13 Herein, we demonstrate the fabrication of PEC cells by using single ultra-long SiNWs as photoelectrodes, which enable the direct comparison of the PEC performance between samples with different diameters. The crystalline SiNWs with the doping density of 1.22 × 1019 cm−3, used in this work, have a maximum length of 8 mm and diameters ranging from 200 to 2000 nm (S1, ESI†),14 which not only benefit the ease of device fabrication and data collection but also allow the systematic study of the diameter effect within a broad size range.
Thanks to the ultra-long feature of the SiNWs, a photoelectrode can be conveniently fabricated by using a single SiNW as the active material (Fig. 1a). A HF-treated single SiNW was fixed with silver paste and silicone rubber at its two ends to fabricate the photoelectrode. The PEC performance of single SiNW photoelectrodes was investigated in a two-electrode configuration with the Me2Fc+/0–CH3OH solution as the electrolyte and a Pt slice (1 cm × 1 cm in size) as the counter electrode under simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination (Fig. S7, ESI†). The Me2Fc+/0–CH3OH electrolyte has been considered to be a suitable system for probing the PEC performance of SiNWs because a conformal radial junction could be formed with low effective surface recombination velocity in the semiconductor/liquid interface.15,16 In addition, SiNW photoelectrodes showed stability for obtaining measurements in such a non-aqueous electrolyte.15,16 The Pt counter electrode has a surface area of 2 cm2, which is 10000 times larger than the active surface area of a single SiNW photoelectrode (for example, 3.14 × 10−5 cm2 for a 1000 nm wide, 1 mm long SiNW). As a result, electrochemical reactions could occur much easier on the Pt slice counter electrode than on the SiNW photoelectrode, as proved by the current contrast between two systems when using single SiNW photoelectrode and the Pt slice electrode as working electrodes, respectively (S2, ESI†).

(b) Plot of current density versus voltage from a 425 nm wide SiNW photoelectrode in the dark and under the simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination. (c) Cycling on–off switching of the PEC photocurrent response of a single SiNW photoelectrode at short circuit. 
Therefore, the current–voltage data from the single SiNW PEC system mainly depend on the properties of the single SiNW photoelectrode and this configuration could be an effective setup for investigating the PEC performance of a single SiNW.

Fig. 1b shows the plot of current density vs. voltage (J–V) from one of the best devices made from a single SiNW with a diameter of 425 nm both in the dark and under illumination. It is pointed out that for the purpose of comparison with literatures, the current density in this work has been normalized to the illuminated projected area (i.e. d × l), similar to the calculation in single nanowire solar cells.13 When the light was on, a forward current began to appear at a voltage of −197 mV and a current density of 0.97 mA cm−2 was observed at 0 applied bias voltage, both demonstrating an obvious photoresponse from the single nanowire photoelectrode. Moreover, the single nanowire photoelectrode exhibited stable PEC photocurrent responses in the cycling test for at least 20 min (Fig. 1c), indicating that the photocurrent came from the photoelectrical conversion rather than the photo-corrosion of SiNWs. It is also noted that the short-circuit photocurrent from a single ultra-long SiNW photoelectrode reached more than 80 nA, which is two orders of magnitude higher than those of solar cells made from single ordinarily-long nanowires (e.g. tens of micrometers),13 demonstrating the advantages of our ultra-long SiNW system in terms of higher photocurrent and signal to noise ratio. The above results reveal that an effective and stable PEC photoelectrode has been fabricated by using the single ultra-long SiNW, providing a useful platform with the very low noise from substrates or other backgrounds for investigating the PEC performance of samples with different diameters.
In order to quantitatively compare the PEC performance of photoelectrodes made from SiNWs of different diameters, four standard parameters were studied, including the open circuit voltage (Voc), the short circuit current density (Jsc), the fill factor (ff) and the energy conversion efficiency (η).  
The open circuit voltage (Voc) reflects the maximum free energy generated by the devices and its value in this work is calculated as the difference between the voltage at which no current passes under illumination and 0 voltage. The short circuit current density (Jsc) is calculated by dividing the short circuit current (Isc) with the illuminated projected area, which is related to the diameter (d) and the effective length (l) of the exposed area of the nanowire in the photoelectrode. The fill factor (ff) is defined as the ratio of the maximum output power density (Pmax) to the product of open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current density (Jsc). The energy conversion efficiency (η) of the single SiNW photoelectrode is defined as the ratio of the maximum output power density (Pmax) to the incident light power density (Pin).

Fig. 2a shows the J–V curves under illumination from four representative samples with diameters of 240 nm, 710 nm, 1130 nm and 1415 nm, respectively. While the nanowire sample with the diameter of 1415 nm exhibits a Voc of 249 mV and a Jsc of 2.48 mA cm−2, the other samples were less effective with lower Voc and Jsc values. Remarkably, the energy conversion efficiency of the 1415 nm nanowire sample (9.51 × 10−4) is almost one order of magnitude higher than that of the 710 nm sample (1.31 × 10−4). The observed difference between these four samples implies that the diameter of nanowires could greatly influence their PEC energy conversion efficiency.

(b) The dependence of the PEC energy conversion efficiency on the diameter of SiNWs. Error bars represent the standard deviation. 
To better understand the relationship between the energy conversion efficiency and the nanowire diameter, statistical results from 80 samples are plotted in Fig. 2b. Three different trends can be found in the plot, which demonstrate that the diameter dependence of the energy conversion efficiency varies significantly for different diameter ranges: first, the energy conversion efficiency drops slightly when the diameter increases from 200 nm to 700 nm; second, the efficiency increases notably with the increase of the diameter between 700 nm and 1400 nm; third, the efficiency would not further increase when the diameter is above 1500 nm. These different trends imply that the diameter of SiNWs has a complex influence on their PEC performance and there might be different dominant factors determining their performance in different diameter ranges.
To investigate the origin of the observed complex trends in the diameter-dependent energy conversion efficiency in different nanowire diameter ranges, monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of single SiNW samples were measured (S3, ESI†). Fig. 3 shows the normalized IPCE from three single nanowire samples with diameters of 425 nm, 960 nm and 1460 nm, respectively. The IPCE curve of the 425 nm sample exhibits a peak at 380 nm and then drops as the wavelength increases, which is obviously distinct from planar silicon materials with excellent broad spectral absorption properties. In contrast, the 960 nm nanowire sample has relatively larger IPCE values in the wavelength range between 400 nm and 800 nm than those of the 425 nm sample. The IPCE can be further improved in the long wavelength range (i.e. 500–900 nm) when the diameter of nanowires reaches 1460 nm. This observation suggests that more effective utilization of light in a long wavelength range could be achieved by increasing the diameter of single SiNWs. Considering the IPCE curves reflect the light absorption properties of SiNWs,4,5 the observed difference in the IPCE between SiNWs of different diameters could be interpreted by their size-dependent light absorption properties.8,9 SiNWs with sub-wavelength diameters usually have stronger absorption at short wavelengths, especially in the wavelength range between 300 nm and 500 nm due to the resonant enhancement effect; as the diameter increases, the absorption of light at short wavelengths would become less effective but the absorption of long wavelength light (e.g. 500–900 nm) would be improved.8,9
 Fig. 3  Normalized IPCE from the standard silicon cell and three single nanowire samples with diameters of 425 nm, 960 nm and 1460 nm, respectively. The detailed normalization method is available in S3 (ESI†). 
It is important to note that the IPCE results are consistent with the trends of the diameter-dependent energy conversion efficiency in different diameter ranges (Fig. 2b). First, when the diameter of SiNWs increases from 200 nm to 700 nm, the absorption of short wavelength light decreases due to less resonance enhancement, and, meanwhile, the absorption of long wavelength light remains weak, resulting in the slight drop of the energy conversion efficiency. Second, when the diameter of nanowire increases from 700 nm to 1400 nm, the light absorption in the long wavelength range (500–900 nm) is significantly enhanced, which obviously improves the energy conversion efficiency by considering that over 60% of the solar spectrum (AM 1.5G) with the photon energy above the Si bandgap (1.12 eV) locates in the wavelength range between 500 nm and 900 nm. Third, when the diameter of nanowires further increases from 1500 nm to 2000 nm, the changes of energy conversion efficiency might depend on the trade-off between the enhanced light absorption and the elongated diffusion distance for carrier collections, which brings more charge scattering and recombination.10,12
To further understand the effects of nanowire diameters on their PEC performance, other important parameters including the short circuit current density (Jsc), the open circuit voltage (Voc) and the fill factor were also studied. Fig. 4 depicts the dependence of Jsc and Voc on the diameter of SiNWs, both of which exhibit similar trends to the energy conversion efficiency. These consistent trends further confirm that the diameter-dependent PEC performance of SiNWs mainly originates from their distinct spectrum responses (IPCE) by considering that the photo-generated current is a common determinant for Jsc and Voc.17

Different from other parameters, the correlation between the fill factor and the nanowire diameters exhibits distinct features. As shown in Fig. 5, symbols and the lines with the same color are the experimental data and the corresponding fitting line of photoelectrodes made from different segments of a single nanowire, respectively (detailed experimental methods are available in the ESI†). The fill factor of single nanowire photoelectrode decreases with the increase of nanowire diameters and fitting lines from different samples have similar slopes. The fill factor reflects the output characteristics of cells and is greatly impacted by the series resistance.17 Single nanowires with diameters in the nanometer or micrometer scale and lengths of 1 mm have a large resistance according to Ohm's law. For example, the electrical resistance of a Si nanowire of 1000 nm wide and 1 mm long in this work is about 64000 Ω (S4, ESI†), much larger than those of planar silicon or SiNW arrays (e.g. 50–150 Ω), which is responsible for their lower fill factors (around 20%) than those of planar silicon or SiNW arrays (>50%).16 Moreover, the impact of the series resistance would become more obvious with the increase of the photocurrent, which suggests that the decrease of fill factors with the increase of diameters is also owing to the enhanced solar spectrum responses (IPCEs) of SiNWs with larger diameters.

In summary, we demonstrated the systematic study of the diameter-dependent PEC performance of SiNWs through the integration of single ultra-long nanowires into effective and stable photoelectrodes. Unlike conventional SiNW arrays on the substrates, our single nanowire based system provides an ideal platform for a direct comparison of the diameter-dependent PEC performance in a broad size range. SiNWs with an average diameter of 1415 nm are found to exhibit the highest solar energy conversion efficiency, which can be mainly traced to their diameter-dependent light absorption properties. While our study is based on single nanowire photoelectrodes, it not only provides deep understanding of the structure–property relationship of single SiNW materials but also sheds light on the fabrication of more efficient photoelectrodes through the structural engineering of other Si-based PEC materials, such as SiNW arrays and other porous Si structures.
