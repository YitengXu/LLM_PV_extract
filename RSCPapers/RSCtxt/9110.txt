    , Accepted 18th January 2021First published on 19th January 2021AbstractHydrogen production via water electrolysis is a sustainable and free approach to meet our energy needs, but the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has a high overpotential. In contrast, urea electrolysis can achieve higher energy conversion efficiency and has the prospect of urea-rich wastewater purification. Herein, porous and amorphous CoSx(OH)y core–shell nanoneedles on Ti-mesh (P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti) are successfully synthesized as a bifunctional catalyst for urea electrolysis. These nanoneedles have a high aspect ratio, and are covered by a large amount of ultra-thin small nanosheets. The amorphous and porous properties and the small nanosheets on nanoneedles result in a high specific surface area and abundant active sites. P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti exhibits outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. When the current density reached 10 mA cm−2, the overpotential was only 86 mV in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti provides abundant Co3+ and oxygen vacancies, which are favorable to improve the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activity. P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti requires a potential of 1.3 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the UOR, much smaller than that of RuO2 (1.45 V). When P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti is used as both the cathode and anode in a two-electrode configuration for urea electrolysis a small potential of 1.3 V is required to output a current density of 10 mA cm−2, lower than that of the Pt/C‖RuO2 couple (1.43 V) as well as other recently reported electrocatalysts. Urea electrolysis can be driven by just a small AA-size battery (1.5 V) and solar panel. Meanwhile, the two-electrode configuration also shows superior long-term stability.
Introduction
To meet the growing energy demand of the world's population, many renewable energy sources have been developed to provide clean and sustainable energy, one of which is hydrogen.1–3 Switching from fossil fuels to hydrogen fuel requires efficient energy storage technology. Hydrogen production via water splitting seems to be a reliable method, but there are still some limitations. A considerable overpotential is generally required to produce hydrogen for practical applications due to the delayed anodic OER kinetics. Several more readily oxidizable substances have been observed, such as methanol,4,5 ethanol,6–8 urea,9–11 hydrazine,12–14etc., which can improve the energy conversion efficiency of the electrolyzer due to their favorable oxidization thermodynamics.
Urea electrolysis and photocatalytic H2S splitting have been studied widely because of their similar applications. Photocatalytic H2S splitting can effectively treat the poisonous and pernicious gas H2S and recycle hydrogen (H2) and sulfur (S) resources,15 while urea electrolysis can not only obtain sustainable and clean H2, but can also be used to purify urea-rich wastewater.16 For urea electrolysis, the theoretical electrode potential of the UOR is 0.37 V,2 which is lower than that of the OER (1.23 V vs. RHE). Therefore, compared with water electrolysis, urea electrolysis can achieve higher energy conversion efficiency. However, urea electrolysis showed slow kinetics due to the 6 e− transfer process of the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), complex intermediate transfer and multiple gas desorption steps.17 Thus, electrocatalysts with high activity and high stability are certainly needed for the extensive practical applications of these clean energies. At present, noble metals such as Pt, RuO2, and IrO2 are used as high-efficiency electrochemical catalysts for the HER and UOR,18,19 but these materials cannot be applied on a large-scale due to their high cost and low abundance. Recently, cobalt hydroxides and oxides have been widely used in electrocatalysis due to their impressive high catalytic activity and stability.20–23 However, the innate catalytic properties of crystalline cobalt hydroxides and cobalt oxides are far from those required to meet the conditions for practical applications. Recent developments include a variety of effective strategies to enhance their catalytic abilities, including heterogeneous element doping,24–27 heterojunction assembly,28–32 use of carbon nanostructures,33–35 defect engineering,36–39 amorphization,40–43 structural transformation,35,44,45 electronic structure adjustment and introduction of vacancies.46–50 However, the existing reports do not make the catalyst suitable for practical applications. Peng's group used spin-polarized DFT calculations to study the reaction path of the UOR; they found that the high-valence metal oxidation state not only determines the activity of the UOR, but also affects the reaction mechanism, where lattice oxygen can be activated by the UOR and promote new reaction pathways.17 In addition, amorphous characteristics can lead to the catalyst having more unsaturated atoms, dangling bonds and active sites, which are favorable to improve the UOR activity. Wang et al.51 reported an effective method which can effectively etch amphoteric aluminum and sulfide CoAl-LDH in one step to synthesize porous and amorphous CoSx(OH)y nanosheets and apply them in the oxygen evolution reaction. However, the CoSx(OH)y nanosheet only shows improved OER activity, which greatly limits its wide application as a catalyst, especially in large-scale applications. Bifunctional electrocatalysts, such as CoMoO4,50 CoP,52 and NiFe-LDH/MXene/NF,53 can improve the water splitting efficiency by catalyzing both the HER and OER in the same electrolyte to further simplify the system and reduce the total cost. Therefore, it is urgent for us to synthesize bifunctional electrocatalysts which have significant catalytic activity for both the HER and OER in the same electrolyte solution.
Based on this, we report for the first time a facile method to synthesize porous and amorphous CoSx(OH)y core–shell nanoneedles on Ti-mesh by directly infiltrating electro-negative sulfur into Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0.11H2O (denoted as CCH) at room temperature (Scheme 1). Using Ti-mesh as a substrate can not only improve the conductivity of the integrated electrode, but can also prevent undesirable aggregation of metal nanoparticles.44,54,55 P-CoSx(OH)y/Ti can be used as a bifunctional electrocatalytic electrode to achieve a high current density of 400 mA cm−2 for both the HER and UOR in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M urea at two very low overpotentials. We further constructed a two-electrode configuration using P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti as both the cathode and anode for urea electrolysis. The configuration only requires two cell potentials of 1.3 V and 1.86 V to attain current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and 300 mA cm−2, lower than those of the Pt/C‖RuO2 couple (1.43 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2) as well as other recently reported electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, it also shows superior long-term stability with 93% current retention after 40 h at a cell voltage of 1.29 V. The high stability of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti during electrolysis can be attributed to the protective effect of the ultra-thin small nanosheets covered on the surface of the catalyst. And the urea electrolysis device can be easily driven by just a small AA-size battery (1.5 V) and solar panel.

Results and discussion
When heterogeneous sulfur atoms partially replace CO32− and OH− in the main crystalline CCH, the induced increment of lattice damage and influence on the electron density characteristics of Co atoms are generated owing to the different electronegativity and atom radius. In addition, these highly dispersed S2− could distort the adjacent coordination of Co and O to generate lattice mismatch, resulting in the formation of an overall amorphous structure.56 CCH nanoneedles on Ti-mesh (CCH NN/Ti) are obtained by a simple solvothermal method. The mass loading of P-CoSx(OH)y NN and CCH NN on Ti-mesh was about 3.20 and 2.60 mg cm−2, respectively.
As the precursor of our experiment, the formation mechanism of CCH is listed as follows: (1) Co2+ + F− → CoF+, (2) CO(NH2)2 + 3H2O → 2NH4+ + CO2 + 2OH−, (3) CO2 + 2OH− → CO32− + H2O, (4) CoF+ + 0.5CO32− + OH− + 0.11H2O → Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0.11H2O + F−. It is worth mentioning that the main function of urea used in this synthesis is to provide an alkaline environment and carbonate anions for the reaction.57 Carbonate anions and OH− are gradually inserted into the intermediate layer by replacing F− to bond with Co2+, thereby promoting the growth of CCH.58 Carbonate anions act as a structure-directing agent for nanoneedles generated during the solvothermal process.

Fig. 1a displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of CCH prepared under the condition of 120 °C for different times (6 h, 8 h, and 10 h). Obviously, the diffraction peaks of the as-prepared CCH NN/Ti coincide with the standard data of Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0.11H2O (JCPDS card no. 48-0083) except for some diffraction peaks of Ti-mesh (JCPDS card no. 44-1294), indicating that CCH NN/Ti was successfully synthesized. It is worth noting that a new characteristic peak at 28.8° appeared with the increase of reaction times (under the conditions of 8 h and 10 h), corresponding to the (121) plane of CCH. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image (Fig. 1b) clearly reveals that the synthesized CCH adopts the structural morphology of a smooth nanoneedle array. And there is no significant change in the structural morphology of CCH with time elapsing (Fig. S1†). To prevent Oswald ripening and aggregation that produces large particles, the reaction condition of 8 h was selected.59 The diffraction pattern of CCH NN/Ti prepared at 8 h has nine broad peaks at 28.8°, 30.4°, 33.8°, 36.5°, 39.5°, 47.3°, 59.9°, 62.2° and 65.7°, relating to the (121), (300), (221), (301), (231), (340), (412), (450) and (023) planes of CCH. The detailed structure of the CCH nanoneedles was further studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)/high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM). As shown in the TEM image (Fig. 1d), the diameter of the CCH nanoneedle is about 100 nm. Combined with the high-magnification SEM image (Fig. 1c), it can be concluded that the CCH nanoneedles adopt a high aspect ratio. Some researchers reported them to be needle-like nanowires, which could provide more direct channels for effective electron/ion transport and expose more reaction active sites. 3D spherical nanoarrays were observed in the gaps of Ti-mesh. The nanoneedles of these spherical components share a common center and extend outwards. Fig. 1e shows a HR-TEM lattice image, showing nanograins with sizes of about 5–10 nm. Benefitting from the high resolution of the image, we can clearly see the lattice fringes with a spacing of 2.27 Å, corresponding to the (231) plane of CCH (Fig. 1f).

The precursor CCH NN/Ti was immersed into 3 M Na2S solution for 24 h to obtain P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti. XRD was used to confirm the crystal structure of the prepared catalyst (Fig. 2a). The obtained product was scraped off Ti-mesh to avoid the influence of the substrate; no obvious diffraction peak was detected. In addition, The HR-TEM image in Fig. S2† shows that only a few lattice fringes exist in the core of P-CoSx(OH)y, which have been highly disordered due to the incorporation of sulfur. The disorder arising from the incorporated S2− anions within the CCH structure probably hinders the origin of long-range crystalline order, thus leading to the formation of amorphous P-CoSx(OH)y. No evident lattice fringes and crystal plane space were observed in the HR-TEM and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) images of the edge area of P-CoSx(OH)y (Fig. 2d), certificating the amorphous structure of P-CoSx(OH)y. Compared with the precursor, P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti retained the high aspect ratio and 3D spherical nanoarray structure (Fig. 2e). These properties can provide abundant surface active sites and accelerate the timely release of gas bubbles. A low-magnification TEM image of the complete 3D spherical P-CoSx(OH)y nanoarray is given in Fig. S3.† The high-magnification TEM (Fig. 2b and c) and SEM images (Fig. 2f) clearly show that the surface of the nanoneedles is covered by numerous ultra-thin small nanosheets, forming the core–shell nanostructure. This unique morphology is caused by the strong alkalinity of the Na2S solution. Therefore, the small nanosheets grown on the shell of the nanoneedles have high adaptability to the alkaline environment, which can greatly improve the catalytic stability of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti in alkaline solutions. After sulfur incorporation, the surface of CoSx(OH)y NN became rough and porous, resulting in an increase of the contact area between the catalyst and electrolyte. Elemental mapping verified that Co, O, and S are distributed uniformly in the nanoneedles (Fig. 2g–j).

The surface area and porous structure of the prepared catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption/desorption measurements. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm linear plot of all the samples revealed typical type IV isotherms (Fig. 3a), confirming the existence of mesopores. The surface areas of CCH NN and P-CoSx(OH)y NN are 5.25 m2 g−1 and 33.27 m2 g−1, respectively. P-CoSx(OH)y NN has the higher specific surface area as expected. The relative content of mesopores in P-CoSx(OH)y NN increased significantly compared to that of the precursor (Fig. 3b), which may result in the exposure of more active sites in the catalyst during electrolysis. In addition, the average pore size of P-CoSx(OH)y NN is 9.69 nm, which is smaller than that of CCH NN (33.31 nm), further proving the mesoporous characteristics of these samples.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to unveil the surface chemical composition and valence state of the as-prepared catalysts. XPS survey spectra (Fig. 3c) reveal the main elements in CCH NN/Ti and P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti, which is consistent with the above results. For P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Co 2p (Fig. 3g) displays two main peaks within the deconvoluted regions of Co 2p3/2 at 780.2 and 781.3 eV, accompanied by two peaks of Co 2p1/2 at 795.2 and 797 eV. The peaks at 780.2 and 795.2 eV could be ascribed to Co3+ (the Co 2p1/2–2p3/2 spin–orbit energy level spacing displayed a value about 15 eV);60 the other peaks at 781.3 and 797 eV are characteristic of Co2+. The presence of Co3+ on the catalyst surface can be attributed to the fact that the Co2+ on the catalyst surface is oxidized by O2 that exists in air. The high oxidation state of Co3+ is crucial to enhance the UOR activity of the catalyst.61 Compared to CCH NN/Ti (Fig. 3d), the peaks of Co2+ moved to a higher binding energy after sulfur incorporation, which is caused by the changed electron density around the Co atom and the deformation of the crystal structure. Fig. 3h shows the O 1s spectra of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti. The O 1s spectra are characterized by five peaks including lattice oxygen (529.7 eV, O 0),62,63 S–O (530.3 eV, O 4), oxygen vacancies (530.9 eV, O 5),64–66 metal hydroxide (531.3 eV, O 1),21 and chemisorbed water (532 eV, O 2). Oxygen vacancies can adjust the electronic structure of the catalyst and improve the UOR activity of the catalyst. For CCH NN/Ti (Fig. 3e), the O 1s spectra can be deconvoluted into four main contributions with the corresponding peaks located at 530.6 eV (O 0),67 531.3 eV (O 1), 532 eV (O 2) and 533.0 eV (O 3). O 3 represents the peak of the carbonate anion derived from Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0.11H2O. It is apparent that sulfur incorporation is essential for the generation of oxygen vacancies. For P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of S 2p (Fig. S4†) is deconvoluted into seven characteristic peaks. The peaks at about 161.5 and 162 eV correspond to S2−, and the peaks at 163.2 and 164.3 eV are consistent with S22−,68 indicating that the element S has successfully been bonded with the Co atom. The other three peaks at 166.6 eV, 168.2 eV and 169.2 eV in the S 2p spectrum could be attributed to S–O. For CCH NN/Ti (Fig. 3f) and P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti (Fig. 3i), the binding energies of C 1s peaks at around 284.8, 286.2, and 289.3 eV are in accordance with the expected bonding states of CC, CN, and OC–O.52 Table S1† shows the approximate calculated OC–O peak area percentages for the two samples. For CCH NN/Ti, the OC–O peak area percentage (45.7%) is evidently larger than that of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti (13.2%), indicating that the carbonate anion was successfully replaced by S2− during sulfur incorporation. Therefore, the chemical formula of the prepared samples is denoted as P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti.
The electrocatalytic HER capabilities of CCH NN/Ti and P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti are assessed in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M urea by utilizing a standard three-electrode system. For comparison, synthesized commercial Pt/C on Ti-mesh and bare Ti-mesh are also tested. Fig. 4a shows the HER linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) curves of the as-prepared catalysts. For P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti, the applied overpotentials of 100 mV (η10) and 300 mV (η400) versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) were required to reach the two current densities of 10 and 400 mA cm−2, which are lower than those of CCH NN/Ti (η10 = 201 mV, η400 = 532 mV). The performance of bare Ti-mesh is poor and the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C exhibits expected high HER activity (η10 = 41 mV, η400 = 496 mV). Although commercial Pt/C requires a smaller overpotential to achieve 10 mA cm−2, the current density of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti increased faster at higher overpotentials and surpassed that of the 20 wt% Pt/C on Ti mesh at an overpotential of 208 mV. It means that P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti is an excellent catalyst for industrial urea electrolysis for hydrogen production operating at high current density. Simultaneously, P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti shows excellent electrocatalytic activity compared to the recent reported electrocatalysts for the HER (Table S2†). The LSV curves of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti in different electrolytes are shown in Fig. 4b, P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti shows similar HER activity (η10 = 86 mV) in 1.0 M KOH without urea, indicating that the existence of urea will not greatly affect the HER activity. The catalytic kinetics were further estimated from the Tafel slope (Fig. 4c). The Tafel slope of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti is about 95.5 mV dec−1, much smaller than that of CCH NN/Ti (175.6 mV dec−1). The Tafel slope of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti is similar to that of commercial Pt/C (44.1 mV dec−1), confirming that P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti exhibits good kinetics for the HER. If the Volmer, Heyrovsky or Tafel steps are the rate determination steps, the expected Tafel slope is 120, 40, or 30 mV dec−1, respectively. For P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti, the HER occurs in the Volmer–Heyrovsky process, where the rate determination process is electrochemical desorption. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are used to provide more insight into catalytic kinetics, P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti delivers lower charge-transfer resistance compared with CCH NN/Ti (Fig. 4d), indicating fast electron transfer in the three-electrode system for the HER. The huge improvement of HER activity for P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti is mainly due to the amorphous properties. It is well known that the amorphous nature could promote both Volmer and Heyrovesky processes because of its good interaction with OH−.50 The high specific surface area caused by sulfur incorporation could significantly increase the number of active sites of the catalyst. Moreover, the 3D spherical nanoarray and porous structures could promote gas diffusion and mass transport, which are favorable to enhance the HER activity.

(e) Polarization curves of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti before and after 2000 cycles. (f) Stability test of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti. 
Electrocatalytic stability is a key factor to estimate catalyst performance and whether the catalyst can be used for practical applications. Cycling tests and chronoamperometric response tests are used to evaluate the electrochemical stability of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti (Video S1†). After 2000 cycles of continuous CV scanning, P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti exhibits the same LSV curves as the first cycle (Fig. 4e). Fig. 4f shows the time-dependent current density curve of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti at a constant potential of −0.1 V vs.. RHE. The cathode current density of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti decreased slightly within 40 h in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M urea. When the time reaches 40 h, the cathode current density attains 90.5% of the initial current density. The relevant SEM images show that the morphology of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti remained as nanoneedles after 40 h-electrolysis for the HER (Fig. S5a–c†). Elemental mapping (Fig. S5d–g†) demonstrates that Co, O and S elements still exist in P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti. No obvious signal of Ti was detected in the XPS pattern (Fig. S7e†), indicating that the Ti-mesh acting as the substrate did not form other Ti-based compounds on the catalyst surface during the HER. The XRD image (Fig. S6†) showed that all the diffraction peaks of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti after long-term HER are consistent with the standard data of Ti-mesh, which further proved that the Ti-mesh in P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti did not form other Ti-based compounds. The full XPS spectrum shows that P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti before and after long-term HER have almost the same contents of Co, O, and S elements (Fig. S7a and e†). In addition, it can be seen from the high-resolution XPS spectra that the surface element valence state of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti did not change after long-term HER (Fig. S7b–h†). P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti after the long-term HER stability test still shows the same fast electron transfer compared with the pristine sample (Fig. S8†). All the above results strongly confirm that P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti has excellent HER stability.
The UOR performances of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti, CCH NN/Ti, RuO2 and bare Ti-mesh are also assessed in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. From the polarization curves (Fig. 5a), P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti displays two small potentials of 1.3 V and 1.73 V to reach 10 and 400 mA cm−2, respectively, while commercial RuO2 on Ti-mesh (η10 = 1.45 V) and CCH NN/Ti (η10 = 1.58 V) require larger overpotentials. Bare Ti mesh exhibits poor UOR performance, indicating the excellent catalytic activity of P-CoSx(OH)y NN. The UOR catalytic activity of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti is also one of the best among those reported catalysts in the literature (Table S3†). The LSV curve of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti tested in 1.0 M KOH is shown in Fig. 5b; a high potential of 1.43 V was needed to output 10 mA cm−2 for the OER. P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti delivers a Tafel slope of 104 mV dec−1 (Fig. 5c), which is lower than that of CCH NN/Ti (179 mV dec−1) and close to that of RuO2 on Ti-mesh (77.3 mV dec−1), indicating its superior kinetics for the UOR. EIS data (Fig. 5d) again showed that P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti has a smaller Rct in Nyquist plots compared to CCH NN/Ti, suggesting that P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti has an excellent electron transport pathway for the UOR.

Meanwhile, P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti shows a promising UOR catalytic stability. After 2000 cycles of continuous CV scanning, there was no significant degradation of UOR activity (Fig. 5e). The time-dependent current density curve is shown in Fig. 5f. P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti could also maintain 84.5% of its initial activity even working at a high potential of 1.48 V in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea for 40 h, indicating that P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti has high UOR stability. The SEM images (Fig. S9a–c†) show that most of the P-CoSx(OH)y nanoneedles on Ti-mesh retain their nanoneedle structure after the long stability test, and only a few are transformed into nanosheets. Elemental mapping (Fig. S9d–g†) demonstrates that Co, O and S elements still exist in P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti. No obvious signal of Ti was detected in the XPS pattern (Fig. S7i†), indicating that the Ti-mesh acting as the substrate did not form other Ti-based compounds on the catalyst surface during the UOR. The XRD image (Fig. S10†) showed that all the diffraction peaks of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti after long-term UOR coincide with the standard data of Ti-mesh, which further proved that the Ti-mesh in P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti did not form other Ti-based compounds. The full XPS spectrum showed that the content of S for P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti reduced slightly after the long-term UOR stability test (Fig. S7a and i†). As shown in Fig. 7b and j, the peak corresponding to Co3+ ions showed an increase in the peak area after long-term UOR, suggesting a gradual change of some of the Co2+ ions into Co3+ ions. Therefore, we speculate that the chemical composition of few nanosheets formed during the UOR may be CoOOH. It can be clearly seen in the S 2p XPS spectrum that the peaks of oxidized-S were increased significantly (Fig. S7l†), indicating that most of the S ions are oxidized during the UOR. No significant change in the O 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. S7k†) was detected. In addition, P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti still maintains a good electron transport pathway after the long-term UOR stability test (Fig. S11†), further proving its outstanding UOR stability.

To choose the best urea concentration for our electrolytic cell, LSV experiments were carried out with different concentrations (0.3–0.7 M) of urea in 1.0 M KOH as shown in Fig. 5b. It is apparent that the current density of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti is the highest when the urea concentration is increased to 0.5 M at the same voltage. When the urea concentration increased above 0.5 M, the current density began to decrease, indicating the saturation kinetics of the UOR on P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti. In addition, the partial surface of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti will be covered by excessive urea and reaction products, which will limit the contact between the catalyst and OH− group of the electrolyte. Therefore, the urea concentration of 0.5 M was chosen for the electrochemical test of the UOR.
To verify whether the catalyst has a side reaction during the UOR, gas chromatography (GC) is used to quantify the generated gas at different applied potentials in the three-electrode configuration. It can be seen from Fig. S12† that the N2 ratio produced in the constructed catalytic system is as high as 90.75% at 1.3 V vs. RHE, indicating that the synthesized P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti can carry out efficient urea oxidation at a low voltage of 1.3 V, which is consistent with the above results. In addition, the ratios of N2 produced at different applied potentials (ranging from 1.3 to 2.0 V vs. RHE) are all higher than 80% (in all cases, a small amount of air will remain in the syringe), demonstrating that urea oxidation is more thermodynamically favorable than the OER. With the increase of the applied voltage, the proportion of N2 in the catalytic system decreased slightly. It can be concluded that the OER route (competitive reaction) is increased slightly at high voltages. A little amount of O2 (10–20%) was detected in the system at a large voltage of 2.0 V, indicating the great selectivity of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti for urea oxidation.
To further illustrate the improvement of the catalytic performance of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti, electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was used to assess the electrochemically active surface area in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea (Fig. S13†). The values of Cdl for P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti and CCH NN/Ti were 113.32 and 14.87 mF cm−2, respectively. The result suggested that P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti has a great increasing ECSA after sulfur incorporation. The high increase of Cdl for P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti can be attributed to the amorphous properties and the rough and porous surface caused by sulfur incorporation.
Considering the excellent capabilities of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti for the HER and UOR, we constructed a two-electrode system using P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti as both the cathode and anode in 1 M KOH with 0.5 M urea (Fig. 6c). An electrolyzer of the as-prepared Pt/C‖RuO2 was used for comparison. As shown in Fig. 6a, only a cell voltage of 1.3 V was applied to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−2 for P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti‖P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti, which is much smaller than that of Pt/C‖RuO2 (1.43 V). Moreover, the alkaline urea electrolyzer exhibits a low cell voltage (1.86 V) to achieve a high current density of 300 mA cm−2. It can be clearly seen that the synthesized P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti‖P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti exhibits superior catalytic activity in the electrolyte of 1 M KOH and 0.5 M urea, indicating that the electrode system has significant catalytic activity for hydrogen production through urea electrolysis. According to our knowledge, the catalytic activity of the as prepared two-electrode device can be comparable to that of the best recent two-electrode systems (Table S4†). Compared to the electrolyte 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea, P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti‖P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti requires a higher cell potential of 1.48 V to output a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. 6b), demonstrating that urea electrolysis could indeed achieve higher hydrogen production efficiency. Meanwhile, P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti‖P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti shows promising high stability with a current retention of 93% at a cell voltage of 1.29 V for 40 h-electrolysis (Fig. 6d). Considering that the electrode system powered by commercial batteries and solar panels has the advantages of being portable and sustainable, two urea electrolysis devices driven by a single 1.5 V battery and 6 V solar panel were constructed. Fig. 6e shows the optical image of the overall urea electrolysis system driven by a 1.5 V battery. The related dynamic video is shown in Video S2.† The application of alkaline urea electrolysis powered by solar energy was tested with a self-made two-electrode device integrated with commercial silicon solar panels (Fig. 6f). The anode and cathode (P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti) are connected to the two terminals of the solar panel. The voltage applied from the solar panel to the two-electrode system is monitored using a digital multimeter connected in parallel with the terminal. The voltage of 1.7 V can be easily controlled by adjusting the intensity of solar radiation. When observed carefully, we can clearly see obvious hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide bubbles on the cathode and anode in Video S3.† All the above results illustrate the superior catalytic performance of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti, which can be considered as a promising catalyst for sustainable hydrogen production in industrial applications for urea electrolysis.
To investigate the effects of different Na2S concentrations (1 M, 3 M and 5 M) on the structure, composition and activity of the as-prepared electrodes, electrodes are manufactured under different preparation conditions for comparison. It is worth noting that when the Na2S concentration is 1 M, the XRD pattern (Fig. 7a) of the fabricated catalyst (denoted as 1 M-NN) still shows some characteristic peaks of CCH, indicating that the concentration of Na2S is not enough to destroy the crystal lattice. The SEM images (Fig. S14a–f†) showed the rough nanoneedle morphologies of the synthesized catalysts at different Na2S concentrations. The related LSV curves of the electrodes are shown in Fig. 7b and c; the comparison showed that the P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti electrode synthesized with 3 M Na2S exhibits the highest bifunctional catalytic performance. 1 M-NN possessed the worst catalytic activity, which further demonstrated that the amorphous properties could indeed improve the HER and UOR activity. The effects of different temperatures on the catalyst were also studied. The XRD image (Fig. 7e) shows that most of the diffraction peaks are consistent with the standard data of CoSO4·6H2O (JCPDS card no. 16-0304) except for some diffraction peaks of Ti-mesh when the hydrothermal temperature is above 100 °C. The peak at around 54.5° is related to the (531) plane of Co9S8 (JCPDS card no. 02-1459). With the increase of the hydrothermal temperature, the relative content of Co9S8 in the catalyst gradually decreased, which may be caused by the oxidation of Co9S8 to CoSO4·6H2O. The SEM images (Fig. S14g–j†) show that the fabricated catalysts adopt a smooth nanoneedle morphology when the hydrothermal temperatures are 100 °C and 120 °C. The TEM image of CCH NN/Ti after being treated with 3 M Na2S at 120 °C (Fig. 7d) displays a core–shell nanoneedle morphology. Fig. 7h shows a related HRTEM lattice image; the nano-particles of the shell show a lattice spacing of 1.88 Å, corresponding to the (319) plane of CoSO4·6H2O. Meanwhile, the nanoparticles of the core show a lattice spacing of 1.68 Å, which can be attributed to the (531) plane of Co9S8. The result is consistent with the above XRD analysis. The related LSV curves of the electrodes (synthesized at room temperature, 100 °C, 120 °C and 140 °C) for the HER and UOR are shown in Fig. 7f and g. As expected, P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti synthesized at room temperature showed the highest HER and UOR activities. Therefore, the synthesis conditions of 3 M Na2S and room temperature are the best choice. In addition, it can be clearly seen that the CoSO4·6H2O nanoneedles with high aggregation and crystallinity are transformed into messy CoSO4·6H2O nanoneedles and nanosheets at 140 °C (Fig. S14k and l†). This may be due to the accelerated Oswald ripening caused by high temperature, leading to the rapid dissolution and recrystallization of nanoparticles, thus resulting in the conversion of nanoneedles to nanosheets.
Conclusions
In summary, porous and amorphous CoSx(OH)y core–shell nanoneedles on Ti-mesh were synthesized successfully though a facile two-step method for highly energy-efficient hydrogen production via urea. P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti exhibits superior bifunctional catalytic activities, and only requires two low potentials of 1.3 V and −0.086 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the UOR and HER, respectively. The two-electrode system assembled using P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti as both the cathode and anode only demands a small voltage of 1.3 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2 for overall urea splitting. The excellent catalytic performance of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti can be attributed to the porous and amorphous properties, the ultra-thin small nanosheets, the high conductivity of the electrode and abundant oxygen vacancies. Benefitting from the well-arranged 3D spherical nanoarray and porous structure, gas diffusion and mass transfer during electrolysis can be promoted. The ultra-thin nanosheets covered on the nanoneedles provide the catalyst with a high specific surface area and structural stability. The two-electrode configuration using P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti as both the cathode and anode has excellent electrochemical stability in alkaline urea solution. Urea electrolysis can be driven by just a small AA-size battery (1.5 V) and solar panel. In addition, P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti has a high selectivity for urea oxidation at a large voltage of 2 V. The whole manufacturing procedure of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti is low-cost and easy to scale-up. All the above advantages indicate the huge application potential of P-CoSx(OH)y NN/Ti for large-scale sustainable hydrogen generation via urea electrolysis.
