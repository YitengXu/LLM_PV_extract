    AbstractA novel copolymer based on alternating fluorene and donor–acceptor–donor segments is reported, together with its photovoltaic properties in blends with fullerene derivatives. The balanced electron and hole mobility of the blends leads to a power-conversion efficiency of 2–3% under solar illumination.
Introduction
The synthesis of polymer solar cells with high power-conversion efficiency is currently highly desirable. To reach this goal, the optical absorption, electronic structure and electronic transport properties of the polymer solar cells must be properly combined. The balance of these properties is essential to achieve improved efficiency, and controlling the morphology in the blends of donors and acceptors is one route to balancing the properties of electrical transport, charge generation and charge recombination. In the class of bulk heterojunction materials, where a conjugated polymer is blended with a fullerene derivative, efforts to manipulate the nanostructure by thermal treatments1 or solvent processing2,3 are popular.4 A route to modify the fullerene structure to improve its miscibility with polymers has been attempted in a few systems.5 In our quest to find new polymers suitable for photoinduced charge generation in combination with fullerene acceptors, we have generated a number of new combinations. Here we report a novel polymer, based on the donor–acceptor–donor (DAD) strategy designed to provide polymers that absorb over the solar spectrum.6–9 This polymer has been designed to be chemically compatible with fullerenes. A small fraction of the polymer contains polar side groups, which are intended to improve miscibility with the fullerene acceptor and stabilise the morphology. The devices, based on bulk heterojunctions of this polymer with PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester), show power-conversion efficiencies in the 2–3% range, but microscopy does not provide any evidence for improved miscibility.
Experimental
Synthesis

4,7-Di(thiophene-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (3). 
4,7-Dibrombenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (1) (5 g, 17 mmol) and PdCl2(PPh3)2 (0.24 g, 0.34 mmol) were dissolved in THF (70 mL) by reflux under nitrogen. Tributyl(thiophene-2-yl)stannane (2) (10.8 mL, 34 mmol) was then added dropwise from a dropping funnel over 40 min and the reflux continued overnight. The mixture was cooled, the solvent removed by a rotary evaporator and the residue taken up in petroleum ether. The resulting solid was collected by suction filtration to afford compound 3 (3.7 g, 74%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) δ (ppm): 8.12 (2H, d, J = 3.6), 7.88 (2H, s), 7.47 (2H, d, J = 5.2), 7.23 (2H, m). MALDI (m/z) 299.94 (M+), (calculated = 300.42 g mol−1).

4,7-Di(thiophene-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (3) (0.75 g, 2.5 mmol) and zinc dust (1.96 g, 30 mmol) were added to acetic acid (90 mL) and heated to 80 °C under nitrogen for 35 min. The insoluble solid was then removed by suction filtration and the filtrate was transferred to a new flask to which 1,2-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)ethane-1,2-dione (4) (2.78 g, 5.25 mmol) was added. The mixture was heated at 60 °C for 3 h. The solid formed was collected by suction filtration and dried to give 2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)-5,8-di(thiophene-2-yl)quinoxaline (5) (1 g, 57%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) δ (ppm): 8.16 (2H, s), 7.88 (2H, d, J = 3.6), 7.5 (2H, d, J = 4.8), 7.39 (2H, s) 7.18–7.26 (4H, m), 6.9 (2H, d, J = 3.6), 3.9 (4H, t), 1.75 (4H, m), 1.2–1.8 (20H, m), 0.89 (6H, t). MALDI (m/z) 702.13 (M+), (calculated = 703.01 g mol−1).


5,8-Bis(5-bromothiophene-2-yl)-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline (6). 
2,3-Bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)-5,8-di(thiophene-2-yl)quinoxaline (5) (0.99 g, 1.41 mmol) was dissolved in dry THF (37.5 mL) and to this was added N-bromosuccinimide, NBS (0.503 g, 2.82 mmol). The mixture was stirred under nitrogen in the dark for 1 h and then poured into water and the resulting solid was collected by suction filtration. Compound 6 was obtained in pure form (0.718 g, 59.3%) after chromatographic purification on silica gel using dichloromethane–petroleum ether (2 : 3) as the eluent. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) δ (ppm): 8.09 (2H, s), 7.56 (4H, m), 7.22 (2H, m), 7.12 (4H, m), 7.0 (2H, m). MALDI (m/z) 859.92 (M+), (calculated = 860.80 g mol−1).


2,3-Bis(3-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)phenyl)-5,8-di(thiophene-2-yl)quinoxaline (8). 
Compound 3 (1.25 g, 4.17 mmol) and zinc dust (3.26 g, 50 mmol) were added to acetic acid (116 mL) and heated to 80 °C under nitrogen for 35 min. The insoluble material was removed by filtration, the filtrate was transferred to a new flask, and 1,2-bis(3-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)phenyl)ethane-1,2-dione (7) (1.566 g, 3.3 mmol) was added. The mixture was heated at 60 °C for 3 h, cooled to room temperature and the precipitate was collected by suction filtration to afford compound 8 (2.2 g, 42.5%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) δ (ppm): 8.15 (2H, s), 7.89 (2H, d, J = 3.2), 7.5 (2H, d, J = 4.4), 7.33 (2H, s) 7.18–7.26 (4H, m), 6.9 (2H, d, J = 8), 0.89 (18H, s), 0.165 (12H, s). MALDI (m/z) 706.04 (M+), (Calculated = 707.01 g mol−1).


5,8-Bis(5-bromothiophene-2-yl)-2,3-bis(3-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline (9). 
Compound 8 (2.115 g, 2.995 mmol) was dissolved in dry THF (79 mL) and to this was added NBS (1.067 g, 5.99 mmol) followed by stirring in the dark, under nitrogen, for 1 h. The mixture was then poured into water and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was collected, washed with brine and distilled water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and the solvent removed to afford 9 (2.26 g, 87.5%) as a solid material. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) δ (ppm): 8.06 (2H, s), 7.57 (2H, d, J = 4), 7.2 (4H, m), 7.1 (2H, d, J = 4), 6.9 (2H, m) 1.0 (18H, s), 0.2 (12H, s). MALDI (m/z) 863.80 (M+), (calculated = 864.90 g mol−1).


3,3′-(5,8-Bis(5-bromothiophene-2-yl)quinoxaline-2,3-diyl)diphenol (10). 
Compound 9 (2.1 g, 2.43 mmol) and a 1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride in THF (11 mL, 10.9 mmol) were dissolved in dry THF (40 mL) and stirred overnight at room temperature under nitrogen. The THF was then removed using a rotary evaporator. The solid residue was dissolved in chloroform and a small amount of methanol, and the resulting solution was washed with water and the organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Removal of the solvent gave an orange solid which was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using chloroform–methanol (4.8 : 0.2) as the eluent to afford compound 10 (0.32 g, 20.6%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) δ (ppm): 8.08 (2H, s), 7.57 (2H, d, J = 4), 7.2–7.28 (6H, m), 7.13 (2H, d, J = 4), 6.9 (2H, m). MALDI (m/z) 635.71 (M+), (calculated = 636.38 g mol−1).


APFO (alternating polyfluorene)-25. 
5,8-Bis(5-bromothiophene-2-yl)-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline (6) (0.10 g, 0.12 mmol), 3,3′-(5,8-bis(5-bromothiophene-2-yl)quinoxaline-2,3-diyl)diphenol (10) (0.01 g, 0.01 mmol), 2,2′-(9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl)bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane) (11) (0.09 g, 0.13 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (0.02 g, 0.013 mmol) were placed in a 25 mL round-bottomed flask containing toluene (10 mL) under nitrogen. The mixture was refluxed for 10 min. To the refluxing mixture, tetraethylammonium hydroxide (0.56 mL, 4.01 mmol) was added using a syringe via a septum. The refluxing continued for 4 h and the polymer was end-capped by adding bromobenzene (0.13 mL, 1.07 mol). After 1 h, phenyl boric acid (0.15 g, 1.20 mmol) was introduced. The mixture was then refluxed for a further hour, cooled to room temperature and slowly added to a flask containing methanol (250 mL). The resulting solid was collected by suction filtration and dissolved in chloroform. Ammonia was added and the mixture stirred overnight. The chloroform solution was separated and washed one more time with fresh ammonia and then twice with distilled water, each time by stirring the mixture for 30 min. The chloroform layer was concentrated to a small volume and the polymer was re-precipitated by slow addition to methanol. The solid was collected by suction filtration and the low-molecular-weight oligomers were separated by Soxhlet extraction with ether. The remaining material was extracted with chloroform. The chloroform solution was concentrated to a small volume and the polymer was once again precipitated from methanol and then collected by suction filtration, and dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature overnight to afford APFO-25 (0.125 g) as a brown powder.
Square-wave voltammetry measurements were carried out on a CH-Instruments 650A Electrochemical Workstation. A three-electrode setup consisting of platinum wires as both working and counter electrodes, and a Ag/Ag+ quasi-reference electrode was used. A 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in anhydrous acetonitrile was used as the supporting electrolyte. The polymer and [60]PCBM were deposited onto the working electrode from chloroform solutions, containing a small amount of Bu4NPF6. Nitrogen gas was bubbled through the electrolyte prior to each experiment. During the scans, nitrogen gas was flushed over the electrolyte surface. After each experiment, the system was calibrated by measuring the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox peak. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers and electron acceptors were calculated from the peak values of the third scan by setting the oxidative peak potential of Fc/Fc+vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) to 0.630 V and the NHE vs. the vacuum level to 4.5 V.
Device preparation and characterisation was performed as previously reported.9 In this study, device layer thickness was determined by AFM (Dimension, Veeco).

Results and discussion
The synthetic routes to the DAD segments of APFO-25 are depicted in Schemes 1 and 2.

 Scheme 2  Synthesis of 3,3′-(5,8-bis(5-bromothiophene-2-yl)quinoxaline-2,3-diyl)diphenol (10). 
The synthesis of the first DAD segment (6) started with a Stille coupling reaction between 4,7-dibromo[2.1.3]benzothiadiazole (1) and 2-(tributylstannyl)-thiophene (2) in the presence of a palladium(II) catalyst to give the coupled compound 3 in good yield. Reduction of compound 3 with zinc in acetic acid gave the diamino compound which was directly condensed with 4 to give compound 5 as a yellow–green solid. Compound 5 was then brominated with N-bromosuccinimide to afford 6 as a red solid.
The second DAD segment (10) of APFO-25 was synthesised in a similar fashion to that described above for compound 6. Thus, compound 3 was reduced with zinc and condensed with compound 7 to give compound 8 as a red powder. Bromination of 8 with NBS yielded compound 9 and the silyl protection was removed by treating compound 9 with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) to afford compound 10 as depicted in Scheme 2.
Once the two DAD segments were made, the last step in the course of the synthesis of APFO-25 was the Suzuki coupling reaction between compounds 6 (45%), 10 (5%) and 11 (50%) (Scheme 3).
 Scheme 3  Synthesis of APFO-25. 
The polymer was exhaustively washed with ammonia and distilled water to remove any remaining catalyst. The solid was also purified by Soxhlet extraction with diethyl ether until the ether extract became essentially colourless. The chloroform-soluble portion was then precipitated from methanol, giving APFO-25 as a brown solid.
The molecular weight of the polymer was determined using size-exclusion chromatography to be MN = 17000 and MW = 37000, relative to a polystyrene standard.
Electronic structure and optical properties
The UV–Vis absorption spectrum of the polymer was recorded for a thin polymer film on a glass slide (Fig. 1). We found the optical absorption to start at 630 nm with a first local maximum at 534 nm (2.3 eV) and a second maximum at 390 nm (3.2 eV). The optical band gap is similar to that of APFO-15.10
The electronic structure of the polymer was estimated by square-wave voltammetry, and we found the energies of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals to be 5.8 and 3.3 eV vs. vacuum, respectively. This gives ample driving force (0.75 V) for photoinduced electron transfer to PCBM (LUMO 4.1 eV vs. vacuum) and 0.7 V for photoinduced hole transfer to APFO-25 from the PCBM. The electrochemically-determined bandgap of APFO-25 is 2.5 eV.
We find photoinduced charge transfer in the bulk heterojunction to be very efficient, as shown in the photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiment (Fig. 2). The PL of the polymer is around 700 nm but is reduced by three orders of magnitude on formation of the bulk heterojunction. The weak remnant PL is however not due to polymer or acceptor, but dominated by an emission at 840 nm, which we identify as a charge-transfer transition. Atomic force microscopy studies of the blends show a fine structure for [60]PCBM blends (Fig. 3) and a much more coarse structure in [70]PCBM blends (not shown). When comparing these observed morphologies to those in the parent polymer APFO-1510 we did not observe better miscibility between the fullerene and the polymer phase. We did however observe variations in the nanostructure between different stoichiometries, more pronounced structures being present in the 1 : 4 stoichiometry.

External quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of some of devices under monochromatic light are presented in Fig. 4. We note that EQEs between 20 and 40% are obtained over the spectral range 400–600 nm, varying with stoichiometry and thickness. For each stoichiometry, the best device performance was obtained at a thickness of 80–100 nm. The photovoltage is ∼1 V and decreases with increasing PCBM content in the active layer. The fill factor spans values from the very low 0.3 (at stoichiometry 1 : 1) to the very respectable value of 0.7 (at 1 : 4). These numbers combine to give a power-conversion efficiency under simulated air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) that reaches 2.8% for the optimal stoichiometry (1 : 2) and thickness.

Electrical transport properties
These promising device efficiencies require some analysis, and we have investigated the electrical transport properties of the blends using CELIV (charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage) and FET (field-effect transistor) methods. Combining the assignment of mobilities observed in FETs with the (sometimes) double peak found in CELIV studies, we can assign charge (electron, hole) and mobility. Here we focus on the balance of hole and electron mobilities and find that in the 1 : 4 stoichiometry blends the equilibrium low carrier concentration electron mobility is two times smaller than the hole mobility, and that the absolute mobility is of the order of 10−4 cm2 V s−1. Both mobilities decrease with increasing polymer fraction, and this is consistent with the decreasing FF of the solar cells, with 1 : 4 stoichiometry mobilities being roughly 50% higher than 1 : 2 stoichiometry mobilities. The drop in mobility, however, is less severe than in similar systems that require higher fullerene loading for optimum performance,11 reinforcing the conclusion that charge transport is the main reason for high acceptor-loading requirements in many systems. As far as amorphous systems go, this polymer has relatively high and balanced charge carrier mobilities, but still exhibits electrical losses, as seen from the drop in FF for thicker (≈200 nm) solar cells, even for a 1 : 4 ratio of polymer to fullerene where the highest mobilities were observed. For devices containing a larger polymer fraction, the decrease in FF is more pronounced, and 1 : 2 devices exhibit a drop in FF at a thickness of around 100 nm. When combined, the indications from electrical studies are that the good fill factors observed correlate with the electron/hole mobility balance. There is nothing in the electrical data that indicates any morphological variations, but equilibrium mobility is not very sensitive to morphology in amorphous blends.
The role of morphology in controlling the properties of this material is not clear. While it has been shown that the side chains introduced for enhancing miscibility will also give evidence for interaction with the fullerene in monomer/fullerene blends, as seen in FTIR spectroscopy, this has not been observed in the copolymer structure, presumably because the concentration of the alcohol group is so low that it would evade the sensitivity of the IR spectroscopy study. We therefore have no solid evidence for better dispersion of fullerene; indeed, the PL quenching is comparable to that observed for the parent compound APFO-15.
Both electrical transport and morphology influence the device parameters (Fig. 4). These parameters are collated in Fig. 5, where photocurrent, fill factor and power-conversion efficiency are plotted for different thicknesses and stoichiometries. We note that excess PCBM is necessary for electrical transport, and that fill factors of 0.7 can be reached under optimal conditions. The expected variation of photocurrent with thickness is not very visible in the plots, and presumably this variation is dominated by other processes.

Conclusions
We present a new fluorene-based copolymer APFO-25, incorporating functional groups for enhanced miscibility with fullerenes, and obtain 2–3% power conversion efficiency under AM1.5 illumination. The APFO-25/PCBM blends show balanced charge transport for electrons and holes.
