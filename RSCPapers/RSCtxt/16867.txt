    , Accepted 9th December 2013First published on 9th December 2013AbstractAnatase TiO2 mesocrystals with a Wulff construction of nearly 100% exposed {101} facets were successfully synthesized by a facile, green solvothermal method. Their morphology, and crystal structure are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Accordingly, a possible growth mechanism of anatase TiO2 mesocrystals is elucidated in this work. The as-prepared single anatase TiO2 mesocrystal's mean center diameter is about 500 nm, and the length is about 1 μm. They exhibit high light adsorbance, high reflectance and low transmittance in the visible region due to the unique nearly 100% exposed {101} facets. When utilized as the scattering layer in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), such mesocrystals effectively enhanced light harvesting and led to an increase of the photocurrent of the DSSCs. As a result, by using an anatase TiO2 mesocrystal film as a scattering overlayer of a compact commercial P25 TiO2 nanoparticle film, the double layered DSSCs show a power conversion efficiency of 7.23%, indicating a great improvement compared to the DSSCs based on a P25 film (5.39%) and anatase TiO2 mesocrystal films, respectively. The synergetic effect of P25 and the mesocrystals as well as the latters unique feature of a Wulff construction of nearly 100% exposed (101) facets are probably responsible for the enhanced photoelectrical performance. In particular, we explore the possibility of the low surface area and exposed {101} facets as an efficient light scattering layer of DSSCs. Our work suggests that anatase TiO2 mesocrystals with the Wulff construction is a promising candidate as a superior scattering material for high-performance DSSCs.
1 Introduction
As promising candidates for photovoltaic technologies, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been become appealing due to their low production cost and high efficiencies.1–3 To improve the efficiency of DSSCs, one effective route is to efficiently capture sunlight using dye molecules attached to the photoanode nanocrystalline surface.4 Therefore, it is key to enhance light harvesting or absorbance within the photoanode thin film of DSSCs to obtain high-performance DSSCs. In this regard, considerable efforts have been made to develop new dye molecules to increase the light absorption by broadening their spectral response.5–7 Besides this method, another effective route to improve light harvesting is to introduce large diffusive particles into the nanocrystalline TiO2 matrix or on top of the nanocrystalline layer.8–10
Among the various light scattering structures of DSSCs, a bilayer structure consisting of a nanocrystalline underlayer and a large-particle overlayer is mostly employed as an effective and common configuration of a light scattering structure in DSSCs.11–16 This bilayer thin film obtains enhanced DSSCs performance. Currently, various hierarchical structural semiconductors (generally TiO2), such as single-crystalline TiO2 flower-like films,17 hierarchical TiO2 nanorods,18etc. for light scattering and DSSCs photoelectric conversion efficiency have been extensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally. These structures have some common features, such as being mesoporous, have a high specific surface area and excellent light scattering properties. In particular, mesoporous TiO2 microspheres composed of nanoparticles, due to their high specific surface area and light scattering, have been shown to effectively enhance light harvesting and improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency.19–29 The large specific surface area is very favorable for absorbing a large amount of dye molecules and increasing the diffusion of the electrolyte throughout the photoanode thin film. However, this high surface area exhibits a large quantity of electron traps in the crystal grain boundary due to increased surface defects, which act as recombination centers and thus hinder the electron diffusion and decrease the conversion efficiency of DSSCs.30–33 An important question arises as to whether high-performance DSSCs are obtained when materials with a low specific surface area of the hierarchical structure act as a light scattering structure in DSSCs.
Anatase TiO2 single-crystalline sheets with a high percentage of reactive {001} facets have attracted a great deal of research interest.34–38 Some theoretical and experimental work has demonstrated that the anatase TiO2 {001} facets are highly reactive, but anatase TiO2 crystals dominated by {101} facets are usually thermodynamically stable owing to their lower surface energy than the {001} facets. Currently, anatase microspheres with exposed {001} facets have been employed as a light scattering layer to improve the light harvesting efficiency of DSSCs due to their unique structure.20 However, whether anatase with exposed {101} facets can also act as a light scattering layer is still largely unknown. There is still a lack of experimentally established data for high-performance DSSCs based on this structure.
To address the above two problems, herein, we report a photoanode based on a new type of anatase TiO2 mesocrystals with a Wulff construction of nearly 100% exposed {101} facets, synthesized by using a facile, green solvothermal synthesis route. The mesocrystals exhibited excellent reflectance at wavelengths of 400–800 nm. Such mesocrystals were utilized as the scattering layer in DSSCs, and effectively enhanced the light harvesting, thus achieving a higher photovoltaic conversion efficiency compared to commercial P25. The resultant new structures delivered a light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 7.23% as photoanodes in DSSCs. A typical double layer configuration of P25 and the mesocrystals is shown schematically in Scheme 1.

2 Experimental
2.1 Material synthesis
All the chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. In a typical synthesis, 0.6 ml of titanium trichloride was added into a polytetrafluoroethene (PTFE) liner cup of a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (100 ml) containing 40 ml of formic acid under vigorous stirring at ambient temperature. The reaction solution became clear at first and then turned milky because of the formation of a formic-chelated titanium complex. The autoclave was then sealed and heated to 150 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the white precipitate was collected via centrifugation, and rinsed with deionized water and absolute ethanol several times. Finally, it was dried in a vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h.
2.2 Material characterizations
The morphologies of the samples were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Quanta 400). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker) was used to determine the crystalline phase of the samples. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observations were carried out with a high resolution transmission electron microscope (JEOL, JEM-2010) operating at 200 KV. The infrared spectra were obtained on a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer (Shimadzu IRprestige-21). The optical properties of the TiO2 films were measured using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer (Hitachi U-4100) equipped with an integrating sphere. The pore characteristics and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the powders were analyzed by N2 adsorption at 77 K with a volumetric adsorption analyzer (Quantachrome AS-1-MP). Electron impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the DSSC were characterized by an electrochemical workstation (CHI760C, CH Instruments) with a 5 mV AC signal over the frequency range of 10−2 to 105 Hz under 100 mW cm−2 white illumination. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSC were tested by a solar simulator (Newport-Oriel 91192, 100 mW cm−2) equipped with a digital sourcemeter (Keithley, 2400). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using an IPCE evaluation system for solar cells (Beijing Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd, Solar Cell Scan100).
2.3 Photoanode preparation and DSSC assembly
The as-synthesized samples were immersed in a 0.05 M titanium tetrachloride aqueous solution at 70 °C for 1 h, then rinsed in deionized water and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. For the dye absorption, they were immersed in a 1:1 volume ratio solution of ethanol and acetonitrile containing 5 × 10−4 M ruthenium bipyridyl dye (N719 dye, Solaronix). A Pt precursor and a solution of 5 × 10−3 M hexachloroplatinic acid in isopropanol was deposited onto FTO glass by the spin coating process. Then, the platinized electrodes were obtained by thermal decomposition of hexachloroplatinic acid at 380 °C for 20 min. Cells were fabricated with 30 μm thick surlyn film (Dupont) as a spacer between the photoanodes and counter electrodes. The electrolyte containing 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.03 M I2, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15) was finally introduced into the DSSCs by a vacuum filling method. The active area of the cell is 0.159 cm2.
3 Results and discussion

Fig. 1a–b shows typical FESEM images of the large-scale and uniform as-synthesized products. FESEM images with higher magnification (Fig. 1c) reveal that the as-prepared sample exhibits spindle-like morphology. The particle's mean center diameter is about 500 nm, and the length is about 1 μm. Fig. 1d shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the sample shown in Fig. 1a. All of the reflections match well with the anatase TiO2 standard pattern (JCPDS71-1167), and the sharp peaks are indicative of high crystallinity. The shape is very similar to the Wulff construction of anatase crystals grown in nature (Fig. S1, ESI†). The results show that the as-synthesized sample contains typical anatase mesocrystals with the Wulff construction. Different from the anatase mesocrystals by Qi and co-workers,39 the as-prepared mesocrystals in our work are more densely stacked. To further reveal the mesocrystals structure, detailed TEM and HRTEM measurements were carried out.

Fig. 2 shows the TEM and HRTEM images of the mesocrystals after a long ultrasonic process. A clear single mesocrystal is observed in Fig. 2a. The dimension of the mesocrystal is consistent with that of the sample observed by FESEM in Fig. 1c. To obtain more information about this mesocrystal, the surface structure and end structure are further revealed. To obtain the structure of the building block of the as-prepared mesocrystals, a long ultrasonic process was performed. As shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† some nanowire clusters are observed. In addition, from Fig. 2b, a nanowire-like step is also obviously seen on the surface of the mesocrystals. According to the calculation of the interplanar spacing, the step is (101) and (10−1) facets. Moreover, the step is closely stacked from the inner to outer. In other words, the exposed facet of the mesocrystal is {101}. Since the shape of the mesocrystal is very similar to natural anatase TiO2 with the Wulff construction, the whole mesocrystal should also be orderly organized. To confirm this, we further measured the SAED of a single mesocrystal from three different selected areas (white 1, red 2, yellow 3) in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† The three SAED patterns are completely the same from the diffraction spot in Fig. S3b–d in the ESI,† indicating that the whole mesocrystal is well organized according to the Wulff construction of an anatase single crystal. Practically, the exposed {101} facet is also the more stable according to the lowest energy principles. In previously reported literature, a mesocrystal is often constructed by a nanocrystal oriented attachment mechanism.39,40 From the peeled section, we reasonably inferred that the nanowire clusters are obtained by the ultrasonic process so as to shed them from the mesocrystal surface. This evidence implies that the Wulff shape is built up by a nanowire cluster. It should be noted that the end of the mesocrystal also has exposed {101} facets, and the corresponding SAED pattern shows its high crystallinity (Fig. 2d). A corresponding schematic image is also presented in the inset of Fig. S3a in the ESI.† Recently, Zhao et al.41 reported surface recrystallization of a microsphere composed of nanorods, and therefore, we reasonably inferred that the formation of the mesocrystal with the Wulff construction composed of nanowire clusters should have a similar mechanism. To elucidate a more detailed growth mechanism for the anatase TiO2 mesocrystals, a series of time-dependent syntheses were implemented to gain insight into the formation process.

At 20 min after the mixing of formic acid and TiCl3, it can be observed that white precipitates appear at the bottom of the PTFE liner cup at room temperature. The formed sample was then obtained by centrifugation. For further analysis, the white sample was characterized by XRD and FESEM. The results show that the obtained product has incomplete morphologies (Fig. S4, ESI†) and an unknown amorphous crystal phase (Fig. S5a, ESI†).

Fig. 3a–d shows the morphology of the anatase TiO2 mesocrystals with a reaction time from 3 to 12 h. The sample prepared after a 3 h solvothermal reaction is interconnected nanoparticles. It was observed that the small spherical particles were agglomerated with each other to form large particles (Fig. 3a). After a further 3 h, some spindle-like particles began to appear (Fig. 3b). With the reaction continuing to 9 h, a large amount of the spindle-like product appears (Fig. 3c). Finally, when the time reaches 12 h, a large scale and uniform spindle-like product is observed, which is more uniform and elegant than those in Fig. 3c. These particles are similar to the Wulff shape of anatase crystals.

To understand the role of formic acid in the formation of anatase with the Wulff construction, the structural features of the product at some stages were monitored by XRD and FTIR. The XRD of the reaction product before the solvothermal synthesis shows that the product may be an unknown crystal phase with an amorphous feature (Fig. S4, ESI†). Furthermore, at this stage, as shown in the FTIR spectrum, the disappearance of asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the formic function group centered at 1735, 1366, and 671 cm−1 reveals the coordination between the formic acid and titanium centers, indicating the formation of a titanium-containing complex. The –CO band at 1734.85 cm−1 drifted to a lower frequency at 1564.69 cm−1. The band at 1394 cm−1, which is associated with the –COO symmetric stretch also drifted to a lower frequency at 1365.71 cm−1. The difference of about 170 cm−1 in the two modes (1735 and 1565 cm−1) and the difference of about 28 cm−1 in the other two modes (1394 and 1366 cm−1) indicate that formic acid links to the amorphous product. In addition, below 700 cm−1, some Ti–O networks also appear, which provide direct evidence for the formation of a Ti–formic acid complex intermediate. The signature peak of the Ti–O bond at about 616 cm−1 appears in the spectrum of a mixture of TiCl3 and formic acid. This also indicates a chemical reaction between these two chemicals, since neither of these two individual chemicals have Ti–O bonds. As shown in Fig. 1d and Fig. S5b in the ESI,† XRD structural analysis reveals that the Ti–O bonds are from anatase TiO2. The results show that Ti3+ can bind organic ligands with electron pairs to form molecular complexes, which is similar to previous literature.42 This bonding process can slow the hydrolysis process of TiCl3 and allow the growth of nanocrystals with tunable morphologies. The weight loss with increasing heating temperature is given by the TGA-DTG result (Fig. S8, ESI†), which also shows some functional groups of formic acid being removed with increasing temperature, which agrees with the FTIR observations. With the reaction processes continuing (e.g. 12 h), large-scale and uniform anatase mesocrystals emerge at the expense of the formic acid through an assembly process (Fig. 3d). Compared to the product before annealing, the FTIR shows that in the annealed product, the Ti–O–Ti network is completely formed without the extra specific peak of formic acid. As shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI,† when the reaction process increased to 3 h, the FTIR spectrum shows the main bands at 400–700 cm−1, which are attributed to Ti–O stretching and Ti–O–Ti bridge stretching modes. The signal at about 475 cm−1 is assigned to the Ti–O–Ti moiety of anatase TiO2. It should be noted that the Ti–O–Ti network is in contact with the specific functional group of formic acid. In the FTIR spectrum (Fig. 4), the peak at 3423 cm−1 is assigned to the stretching vibrational mode of adsorbed water and hydroxyls on the surface of TiO2. The peak appearing at 1636 cm−1 is attributed to the bending vibration of the O–H bond in hydroxyls and adsorbed water.43–45 It should be noted that the absorption peak at around 1398 cm−1 suggests the existence of carbonate when the reaction process continued to 12 h. It is worth noting that, after a reaction time of 12 h, the XRD pattern displays only anatase crystal diffraction peaks, whereas the FTIR spectrum of the product before annealing still shows the presence of absorption bands centered at 1398 (O–H deformation) and 1636 cm−1 compared to the pure anatase TiO2. A possible explanation could be that the chelating COOH ligands could be broadly and strongly adsorbed on the anatase TiO2 particles. Based on the morphological changes observed in the time-dependent growth of the anatase TiO2 mesocrystals combined with the structural analysis of the HRTEM, a two-step growth mechanism is proposed, as illustrated in Scheme 2.

The FESEM and TEM images are placed on top of (a)–(c) to demonstrate each illustration, respectively. 
Based on the above analysis, we present a possible growth mechanism of the anatase mesocrystals with the Wulff construction. In the initial stage of the anatase TiO2 mesocrystals, the TiCl3 is linked to the molecular structure of formic acid (Fig. S6, ESI†) and formed a TiCl3 and formic acid complex, as shown in Scheme 2a. When the whole mixture system is stable for ca. 20 min, the compounds began to react with each other to form amorphous TiO2 (Scheme 2b). With the condensation processes continuing, anatase mesocrystals (Scheme 2c) emerge through an assembly process of one-dimensional condensation. The adsorption of the formic acid suppressed the growth on the {101} facets of TiO2, resulting in the formation of a nanowire cluster-like structure with exposed {101} facets (Scheme 2d). Finally, the Wulff construction of anatase TiO2 was produced according to the lowest energy principle. Additionally, the formic acid serves as a capping agent to stabilize the formed anatase mesocrystal nanoparticles and prevent them from agglomerating.
To investigate the light scattering properties of the anatase TiO2 mesocrystals in DSSCs, P25 is printed on the bottom layer and the mesocrystals on the top act as the light scattering layer. The cross-sectional FESEM image of the as-prepared bilayer is shown in Fig. 5. From the bilayer image, the thickness of the P25 thin film is ca. 9 μm, and the thickness of the scattering layer is ca. 5 μm. For comparison, a P25 thin film with the same thickness is also fabricated.
 Fig. 5  (a) The cross-sectional FESEM images, (b) the higher magnification image of the cross-sectional FESEM image and (c) the FESEM image of the top layer of the crystals. 
UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the two bare TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 6, which reflect their different light scattering capacities. Comparatively, the P25 + mesocrystals scattering layer exhibits highly diffuse reflectance in the visible range of 400–500 nm, but a distinctly rapid decline in light scattering was observed in the P25 film in the wavelength range from 500–800 nm. Overall, the light reflectance of the double layer film is much higher than that of the P25 film in the wavelength range from 500–800 nm, pointing at the key role of the hierarchical mesocrystals in the two films in dominating the light scattering behavior. In addition, the light adsorption capacity of the bilayer thin film is higher than that of the P25 thin film (Fig. S9, ESI†), while the transmittance of the bilayer thin film is also lower than the P25 thin film (Fig. S10, ESI†). Hence, such a light scattering overlayer with high light absorption and low transmittance would maximize the use of light in the range of 600–800 nm, and thus would enhance the photon-to-electricity conversion efficiency.

Fig. 7 shows the current density–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs fabricated using three samples: P25 thin film, P25 + mesocrystals scattering layer thin film and mesocrystals thin film. The best performance was achieved for the DSSCs using the double layer thin film. The photovoltaic parameters give a short-circuit current density of 14.35 mA cm2, an open-circuit photovoltage of 0.73 V and a fill factor of 0.69, corresponding to an overall photoelectron conversion efficiency of 7.23% under one sun intensity. The efficiency of the mesocrystals is only 3.37%, which is lower than that of P25 only. This low efficiency may be mainly due to the low specific surface area (8.5 m2 g−1) and low pore volume (0.038 cm3 g−1) (Fig. S11, ESI†), thus leading to the low amount of dye loading. Interestingly, when the mesocrystals act as a scattering layer for P25-based DSSCs, a high conversion efficiency of 7.23% is obtained, which is higher than that of P25 only and the mesocrystals only. The synergetic effect of P25 and the mesocrystals as well as the latters unique feature of the Wulff construction of nearly 100% exposed (101) facets are probably responsible for the enhanced photoelectrical performance. The reason is finally elucidated using IPCE and electrical impedance measurements.

To clarify the reasons why a higher photocurrent for the solar cell based on a bilayer thin film can be obtained, we measured the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the sealed DSSCs based on the bilayer thin film and the P25 thin film electrodes with the adsorbed Ru(II) complex (N719). The results are shown in Fig. 8. The quantum efficiencies for all the DSSCs were maximized at about 520 nm, which was near the absorption maximum of the N719 dye. Furthermore, the IPCE in the whole wavelength region increased with the addition of TiO2 mesocrystals due to light scattering, which is consistent with the trend of the short-circuit current density shown in Fig. 7.

Fig. 9a shows the Bode phase plots of EIS spectra for the two types of DSSCs. Based on the low frequency peak value (fmax), the electron lifetime for recombination (τe) for the two DSSCs is calculated according to the follow equation.46,47τe = ωmin−1 = (2πfmax)−1

The equivalent circuit used to fit the experimental data is shown in the inset. The dots represent the experimental data, and the solid curves represent the fitted curve. 
The fmax and τe values for the two DSSCs are summarized in Table 1. On comparing the DSSCs with P25 (69.75 Hz) and the double layer thin film (37.56 Hz), the DSSC with the double layered film shows the lowest value of fmax (37.56 Hz) and the longest electron lifetime (4.2 ms) for recombination. Fig. 9b shows the electrochemical impedance spectra of P25 only and the double layer thin film based DSSCs, respectively. Their Nyquist plots of the EIS spectra are shown in Fig. 9b. There are two sets of semicircles. Each set starts from the total series resistance, followed by a small semicircle (the span, R1) at high frequency, and then a large semicircle (the span, R2) at low frequency. According to the EIS model reported in the literature,46,47R1 is ascribed to the charge-transfer resistance at the Pt counter electrode–electrolyte interface and R2 is related to the electron transport resistance within the TiO2 layer and across the TiO2–electrolyte interface. The fitted parameters, including R1 and R2, obtained by the ZSimpWin software are listed in Table 2.

As shown in Table 2, the P25 + mesocrystals scattering layer shows a higher Rs (sheet resistance) value than the P25-based DSSC, which can be ascribed to the poor attachment of the P25 + mesocrystals scattering layer to the FTO glass. It should be pointed out that the double layered DSSC shows a lower R2 value among the two DSSCs. The reason is that the double layered photoanode overcomes some shortages of the P25 thin film electrodes. The mesocrystal scattering layer with a nanowire cluster-like structure may accelerate the electron transfer between the TiO2–electrolyte interface. This factor contributes to a small resistance.
Additionally, in the double layered photoanode, the compact mesocrystal scattering layer provides more electron pathways from the mesocrystal scattering layer to P25 and subsequently enhances the electron transfer efficiency. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the double layered DSSC has the lowest R2 value among the two DSSCs. In summary, the lowest resistance for electron transport and the longest electron lifetime for recombination could favor the highest charge collection rate of photogenerated electrons, which enhances the efficiency of the DSSCs based on the double layered film.
4 Conclusions
In summary, highly monodisperse anatase TiO2 mesocrystals with a Wulff shape were successfully synthesized on a large scale via a facile one-step method. A possible growth mechanism for the anatase mesocrystals based on the combined analysis of XRD, HRTEM and FTIR is revealed, and their superior light scattering properties were studied for use in DSSCs. The optoelectronic performance investigation of this light scattering material revealed that the unique anatase TiO2 mesocrystals exhibited an enhanced DSSCs performance compared to that of P25. The double layer solar cell made with P25 as the underlayer and anatase TiO2 mesocrystals as the over-layer showed a higher conversion efficiency of 7.23% and a short circuit current density of 14.35 mA cm−2 compared to P25. A great increase in cell efficiency was achieved by employing the mesocrystals as a result of their strong light scattering properties. The highly improved optoelectronic properties of the DSSCs may be ascribed to the unique hierarchical structure of the anatase mesocrystals. Our work demonstrates that Wulff-like anatase mesocrystals with a low specific surface area and nearly all {101} exposed facets can realize high-performance DSSCs when applied as a light scattering layer.
