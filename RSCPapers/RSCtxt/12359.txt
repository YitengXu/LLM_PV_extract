    , Accepted 13th July 2018First published on 17th July 2018AbstractHerein, we prepared two new zinc porphyrin dyes (JA4 and JA5) containing different anchoring groups and applied them in dye-sensitized solar cells. The hydrazide unit was used as an anchoring group for a DSSC, and the device based on the JA5 containing hydrazide anchor also shows a high PCE of 5.49% with a Jsc of 11.57 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 737 mV. COOH is the most common anchor, but it is prone to dissociate from the TiO2 surface, especially under alkaline conditions. Interestingly, the hydrazide anchor shows better water-stability under various aqueous conditions compared with the COOH anchor, including acidic, neutral and alkaline conditions. In addition, a hydrazide unit is very easy to synthesise, thus, hydrazide can be a promising anchoring group for DSSCs.
Introduction
Since dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were first reported by Grätzel and co-workers in 1991, they have attracted widespread attention as a promising photovoltaic technology due to their low costs and high photoelectric conversion efficiency.1,2 A complete DSSC is composed of mesoporous metal oxides, sensitizers, a redox electrolyte and a counter electrode, and the sensitizers play a crucial role in improving the performance of the device.3 To date, many excellent dyes have been developed, including ruthenium-complexes, zinc porphyrins and metal-free organic dyes.4–10 Recently, the porphyrin dye SM315 showed a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13% with a cobalt-based redox electrolyte.11
Although DSSCs have been researched over 20 years, there are still some technical bottlenecks, including low PCE and poor stability.12,13 In general, efficient sensitizers are often designed with typical donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) frameworks, due to their efficient intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) properties.14–16 Among the frameworks, the anchoring groups determine the binding energy of the dye on the TiO2 surface and the time scale of electron injection.17–20 The attachment of dyes to the TiO2 surface is the basis of DSSCs and some proposed water-splitting solar cells. The stability of the adsorbed dyes under aqueous conditions can significantly affect the performance of DSSCs.21,22 The COOH anchor is the most common anchoring group due to its good electronic coupling on the dye–TiO2 interface and high electron injection efficiency. However, the COOH anchor is especially sensitive to water, even in the presence of trace quantities of water.23–25 The results can make the dyes detach from the TiO2 surface easily in the presence of water, thereby decreasing the performance of DSSCs. In order to overcome this problem, researchers tried to use some new anchoring groups instead of the COOH anchor. Some new anchoring groups have been developed, such as pyridine and hydroxamate. But these new anchors have not produced the desired effect.26–28 In the case of hydroxamate, though it is a water-stable anchoring group, the overall performance of the device may be reduced.29,30 To date, no remarkable PCE of a dye containing a hydroxamate anchor has been reported. The dye containing a pyridine anchor can be adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface by strong coordinate bonding, however, the amount of dye adsorbed is generally very small. Recently, tropolone has been used as an anchoring group,31 and the DSSC based on YD2-o-C8T exhibited a high PCE of 7.7%, moreover, YD2-o-C8T was superior to YD2-o-C8 with respect to device durability. Thus, the development of an efficient and water-stable anchoring group is still a very promising research topic, which can improve the durability of DSSCs.
In this paper, we develop a new water-stable anchoring group. The hydrazide anchor was more stable than the COOH anchor under various aqueous conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a hydrazide unit has been used as an anchoring group in DSSCs. Herein, we synthesized two D–A–π–A porphyrin dyes JA4 and JA5. Spirofluorene as an efficient building-block was introduced onto phenothiazine donors, and we deduced that the steric effect of the building-block can effectively prevent the I3− of the electrolyte from penetrating into the TiO2 surface and reduce the charge recombination. Thus, the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of JA4 is 772 mV, and the Voc of the JA5 based-device is 737 mV. These two dyes had almost the same molecular structures, but various anchoring groups. As shown in Fig. 1, the anchoring groups are the COOH anchor and the hydrazide anchor, respectively. We mainly investigated the optical properties and photovoltaic performance of the two dyes, and measured the water-stability of the two anchors under acidic, neutral and alkaline conditions.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthesis of the dyes JA4 and JA5 is provided in the ESI.† The synthetic routes are depicted in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The synthesis details and characterization data are given in the ESI.†
Spectral properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of JA4 and JA5 in THF are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding data are collected in Table S1 (ESI†). The two porphyrin dyes exhibited typical absorption at Soret and Q bands, the former band due to a characteristic π–π* transition predominantly localized at the porphyrin ring, while the latter band can be attributed to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The introduction of a benzothiadiazole (BTD) unit exhibited a significant impact on the absorption of the two dyes. The spectrum of the dye JA4 exhibited a shoulder at 459 nm with the maximum at 435 nm, and that of the dye JA5 exhibited almost the same trend. At the Q bands, the maximum absorption of JA4 lay at 648 nm, and JA5 (647 nm) exhibited a slight blue shift compared to JA4 due to the relatively weak electron-withdrawing properties of the hydrazide anchor. The very similar absorption spectra suggested that the two dyes may have identical light-harvesting ability. Emission spectra were also measured (Fig. S1, ESI†), and they were consistent with the trend of the absorption spectra of the two dyes. We further investigated the absorption spectra of the two dyes sensitized on a 12 μm thick TiO2 substrate (Fig. S2, ESI†). It is obvious that the absorption spectra of the two dyes on the TiO2 substrate were all broader than the spectra in THF, and this may be caused by dye aggregation. Though dye aggregation may quench the excited state and hamper electron injection, meanwhile dye aggregation can also enhance the light-harvesting ability of the two dyes.32

Electrochemical studies
The oxidation potentials of the dyes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S3, ESI†), and the corresponding data are collected in Table S1 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3, the ground state oxidation potentials (EOX) of JA4 and JA5 were 1.04 V and 1.02 V (versus NHE), respectively. They were all more positive than the redox potential of the I−/I3− couple (0.4 V versus NHE), guaranteeing efficient dye regeneration. The corresponding excited oxidation potentials (EOX*) of JA4 and JA5 were −0.86 V and −0.89 V, respectively. The values were both much more negative than the Fermi level of TiO2 (−0.5 V versus NHE), ensuring an efficient electron injection process from the excited dye into the conduction band of TiO2.

Theoretical calculations
In order to gain further insight into the electronic properties of the two dyes, we performed quantum chemical calculations of the two dyes using density function theory (DFT) at the DFT-B3LYP/LanL2DZ level with the Gaussian 09 suite of programs. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the HOMO orbitals of the two dyes were mainly delocalized between the phenothiazine donors and the porphyrin ring, and the LUMO orbitals were mainly delocalized in the BTD units and the acceptors. Thus, such a well-separated orbital distribution indicated that the electron can easily transfer from the HOMO to the LUMO and induce electron redistribution from the donor to the anchoring groups. These results suggested that the photoinduced charge injection can effectively occur from the LUMO to the conduction band of TiO2, so the hydrazide anchor may efficiently complete the charge injection process.
The anchoring mode analysis
We measured the Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra to gain information on the binding mode. The spectra of the dye powders and the dye adsorbed on the TiO2 films are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). From Fig. S5a (ESI†), we can see that the binding way of dye JA4 containing a COOH anchoring group anchored on the TiO2 film was bidentate mode. For JA5 powder, the v(CO) and bending vibration δ(N–H) bands were found at 1669 cm−1 and 1636 cm−1, respectively. After adsorption on the TiO2 surface, the v(CO) and δ(N–H) bands all disappeared. Noticeably, a new band at 1619 cm−1 was found, which can be assigned to the N atoms coordinated to the Lewis acid sites of the TiO2 surface,26,33 thus, the binding mode was identical to the rhodanine anchor (Fig. S6, ESI†). In order to further understand the differences in the dynamics of photo-induced electron injection between the COOH anchor and the hydrazide anchor, we performed the time-resolved fluorescence experiments of the two dyes in THF and adsorbed onto TiO2.5,11 The fluorescence decay curves of the two dyes are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). In THF, the fluorescence lifetimes of JA4 and JA5 are 4.83 and 4.82 ns, respectively. The emission for both dyes is strongly quenched after adsorption onto TiO2, considering that the data fitting included reconvolution of the emission signal over 1 ns excitation pulse length, so the lifetimes of JA4 and JA5 on TiO2 are about 570 ps and 310 ps, respectively. The results indicate that both the two anchors have high electron injection efficiency, as a result of efficient photoinduced charge injection from the LUMOs of the dyes to the conduction band of TiO2.
Photovoltaic performance
To find out the influence of the two anchoring groups on the DSSCs, we fabricated the devices under the same conditions. The photovoltaic parameters are collected in Table S2 (ESI†), and the J–V curves of the DSSCs are shown in Fig. 4. It is clear that the PCE of JA5 (5.49%) is slightly lower than that of JA4 (7.0%). The short-circuit current density (Jsc) of JA5 (11.57 mA cm−2) is lower than that of JA4 (14.44 mA cm−2). We measured the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the two devices to analyze this problem (Fig. S8, ESI†). The IPCE curve of JA4 exhibited photocurrent generation up to 750 nm, and the values are all higher than those of JA5 in the whole visible wavelength range. This showed that the light-harvesting ability of JA4 was higher than that of JA5, despite JA5 having a slightly higher molar extinction coefficient. We further measured the amounts of dye adsorbed for the two dyes anchored on the TiO2 surface. The amount of JA5 adsorbed (1.35 × 10−7 mol cm−2) is lower than that of JA4 (1.56 × 10−7 mol cm−2), and this may be another reason for the lower Jsc of JA5.

The charge recombination process studies
The open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of the JA4 based-device is 772 mV, whereas the Voc of the JA5 based-device is 737 mV. The charge recombination dynamics can limit the Voc. We measured the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) under dark conditions to study this effect, the applied voltage was −0.7 V and scanned from 105 to 1 Hz. In the Nyquist plots (Fig. 5a), the large semicircle represents the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, and the small semicircle represents the electron transport resistance at the Pt/electrolyte interface. We found that the radius of the large semicircle decreased in the order JA4 > JA5, this suggested that the JA4 based-device had a larger Rrec. This result indicated that the JA4 based-device can efficiently reduce the charge recombination rate. This is in agreement with the Voc of the DSSCs. We can determine the peak frequency (f) in the lower frequency region from the Bode phase plots of the DSSCs (Fig. 5b). The electron lifetime (τ) can be calculated by τ = 1/(2πf).34,35 The f values of JA4 and JA5 are 13.5 and 18.3 Hz, respectively. So the electron lifetime values of JA4 and JA5 are 11.8 and 8.7 ms, respectively. The longer electron lifetime corresponds to a lower dark current. Thus, the Voc of JA4 is higher than that of JA5.

The water-stability studies
The water-stability of the TiO2 films sensitized with JA4 and JA5 was investigated under various aqueous conditions for varying amounts of time, including acidic, neutral and alkaline conditions (see the ESI†).36 The JA4–TiO2 films and the JA5–TiO2 films were soaked in acidic water for 1 h, 2 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h at room temperature (Fig. 6a). The results indicated that JA4 detached from the TiO2 films faster, after 24 h, the amount of JA4 decreased to 25%, whereas the amount of JA5 decreased to 44%. In neutral water (Fig. 6b), the stability of the two dyes became better, especially for JA5, even after 24 h, the amount of JA5 still remained at 79%. In alkaline water (Fig. 6c), the stability of the two dyes exhibited a huge difference. Noticeably, the dye JA4 detached from the TiO2 films very quickly, just after 2 h, the amount of JA4 decreased to 21%. After 6 h, the dye JA4 detached from TiO2 almost completely. In contrast, JA5 showed good stability, even after 24 h, the amount of JA5 still remained at 56%. It is clear that the hydrazide anchor was more stable than the COOH anchor under various aqueous conditions. The possible reasons are the stronger binding mode for the hydrazide anchor, because the O and N on the hydrazide unit can both form strong chelating bonds with Ti cations. In addition, the pKa of hydrazide is higher than that of COOH, thus, hydrazide is a better water-stable anchor versus COOH.

Conclusions
In summary, we developed a new efficient water-stable anchoring group. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a hydrazide unit has been used as an anchoring group in DSSCs. Two new porphyrin dyes containing different anchoring groups were prepared and applied in DSSCs (JA4 and JA5). The PCE of the DSSC based on the JA5 containing hydrazide anchor was 5.49%, which was slightly lower than that of the parent dye JA4 containing the COOH anchor (7.0%). More importantly, we compared the water-stability of the traditional COOH anchor and the hydrazide anchor under various aqueous conditions, including acidic, neutral and alkaline conditions. The results indicated that the hydrazide anchor was much more stable than the COOH anchor under aqueous conditions, especially under alkaline conditions. The hydrazide unit was very easy to synthesise, thus, it can be used as a promising anchoring group to improve the durability of DSSCs.
