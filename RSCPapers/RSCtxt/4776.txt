    , Accepted 19th September 2022First published on 20th September 2022AbstractBoron subphthalocyanine (B-Cl-SubPc) and its derivatives have been widely employed in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices owing to the tailorability of their photophysical and photoelectronic behaviors arising from the diversity of possible halogen modifications of the complex. However, there are few reports on organic photodiode (OPD) devices comprising B-Cl-SubPc and the aforementioned derivatives; in particular, their photoresponsivities have been rarely reported. Herein, we explore the influence of the axial fluorination of SubPc on the photoresponsivity of OPD devices with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) configurations. Novel surface photovoltage (SPV) analysis combined with air photoemission spectroscopy was used to elucidate the specific roles of the rapid decay and intrinsic trap state in accelerating the photoresponsivity of fluorinated SubPc. Moreover, these results indicate that advanced computational techniques, including molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, can be used to obtain deeper insights, for example based on electron hopping rates and energy disordering, into the mechanisms underlying experimental results.
Introduction
Novel three-dimensional (3D) vertically stacked architectures including wavelength-selective organic photodiodes (OPDs) have been developed as promising alternatives to conventional Si-based image sensors, owing to the improved spectral response and sensitivity without loss of photoactive area.1–6 This advanced hybrid approach has various benefits, such as better color constancy with respect to Si-based 3D-stacked components, well-balanced RGB spectra, a low dark current (DC), high photoconversion efficiency, and decreased crosstalk between pixels.7–12 The development of different molecular designs for semiconducting materials and optimization of the device architecture (bulk heterojunction (BHJ)) versus planar heterojunction (PHJ) have been extensively pursued to meet the rapidly growing market requirements for OPD devices.12–16
Among the various organic semiconducting candidate materials, boron subphthalocyanine (B-Cl-SubPc) and its derivatives have been widely employed in organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells owing to the capacity to tailor photophysical and photoelectronic behaviors via selection from the diversity of possible halogen modifications of the complex.17–19 Diverse peripherally substituted SubPc materials as well as fluorinated SubPc dimers have been developed as acceptors and correlate the device performance with the heterojunction energetics.20–24 However, reports on OPD devices comprising B-Cl-SubPc and its derivatives with BHJ configuration have been rarely reported.25,26 Moreover, work on the high-speed photoresponsivity of OPDs via optimal material design is ongoing, though substantial progress has been made in efforts toward the optimization of OPD device structure. Insufficient photoresponsivity inevitably leads to image lag in high-frame-rate movies. Typically, photoresponse characteristics are related to the decay performance of the residual photocurrent in a photoactive layer after the external illumination source is turned off, and the decay time is believed to be significantly affected by the charge carrier mobility of the photoelectric conversion layers.27 Energy disorder of photo-active layers has been regarded as a crucial factor in impacting charge carrier mobility thus influences dark current and photoresponse performance.28–30 Any conformational change in the molecular structure or introducing impurities such as dopants will inevitably generate energy disorder.31–33 Notably, better selectivity of halogenation for SubPC will not only induce tuned energy levels but also give rise to a difference in diopole moment.35 Therefore, constructing a heterogenous system with a low dipole moment resulting in improved energy disorder for blend systems is necessary to realize accelerated photoresponsive performances.
Herein, we used unsubstituted SubPc (B-Cl-SubPc) and an axially fluorinated SubPc derivative (B-F-SubPc) as donor materials and coupled them with a fullerene (C60) and a peripheral 2,3,9,10,16,17-hexachlorinated boron subphthalocyanine (Cl6-SubPc) to fabricate BHJs for OPD devices. The effects of the axial fluorination of SubPc on the dark current and photoresponses, including the time-dependent photocurrent as well as the frequency-dependent responses, were investigated. The decay characteristics related to the photoresponse was observed via novel surface photovoltage (SPV) measurements. SPV measurement is a well-established contactless measurement method based on the Kelvin probe (KP) technique, which uses dual-mode, ultraviolet (UV) and visible light.36–38 With UV illumination, air photoemission spectroscopy (APS) can be used to measure the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level for a semiconductor, and the sub-bandgap trap states can be extracted from the integrated area below the HOMO threshold, revealing the energy disorder trend.27,39 Under visible illumination, an illumination-related contact potential difference (CPD) can be acquired to obtain the SPV characteristics.37,40–43 SPV measurements provide changes in the surface potential as a function of the intensity, wavelength, or pulsing of the incident light, and consequently, these experiments are essential for optimizing solar cell device structures.27,39–41,44,45 Based on APS measurements, the sub-band-gap tail states (trap states) were compared to determine the difference in energy disordering. Transient SPV characteristics were obtained under periodic light illumination at specific wavelengths to determine how the decay performances correlate with the trap states and optoelectronic photoresponses.
In addition to these experimental analyses, a novel computational approach was adopted to gain insights into the mechanism correlating the molecular structure of the modified semiconducting materials with device performances. Molecular dynamics (MD) calculations were performed to determine the morphologies of the BHJs. The energy distributions of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of molecules in the morphologies were calculated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations including the influence of partial charges of the surrounding molecules, and these revealed that lower dipole moments provide smaller energy disorders, leading to fast decay of the accumulated charge carriers. DFT calculations were performed to determine the morphologies of the BHJs, considering the molecular environments formed by the surrounding molecules, and these revealed the improvement mechanism for the recovery of the photogenerated charge carriers. The energy disorder and rate of charge hopping between the acceptor molecules in the B-Cl-SubPc BHJs and B-F-SubPc BHJs were investigated and correlated with the aforementioned SPV results.46–50 Finally, the effect of introducing axial fluorine to B-Cl-SubPc on the dipole moment was also examined, and the influence of this effect on energy disordering was uncovered.49,50
Results and discussion
Absorption spectra of blend films
The two types of donor materials, B-Cl-SubPc and B-F-SubPc, were thermally codeposited with an C60 acceptor at an equal volume ratio (1:1) under high vacuum (<10−7 Torr) to form a BHJ photoactive structure. C60 is a suitable acceptor candidate because of its negligibly low absorbance in the visible light region and high electron mobility in the solid film state. Another SubPc derivative, peripheral Cl6-SubPc, was also utilized as an alternative, non-fullerene acceptor to C60, to explore the reproducibility of different photoelectronic performances. The molecular structures of the donors and acceptors used in the working devices are shown in Fig. 1a, in which absorption profiles for blend films are compared. The molecular optoelectronic parameters are summarized in the ESI† (Table S1). All the blend films have similar absorption wavelength maxima λmax of approximately 580 nm, verifying that these BHJ films are green-light-selective absorbers. However, the BHJ films coupled with Cl6-SubPc exhibit intense absorption, with an absorption coefficient α twice that of the C60-coupled BHJ films. This strong absorption performance may be attributable to the similarity between the absorption characteristics of the Cl6-SubPc acceptor and B-F-SubPc and B-Cl-SubPc donors in the relevant visible range (Fig. S1, ESI†). In contrast, C60 exhibits weaker absorption in the aforementioned visible region but stronger absorption in the UV region. Additionally, neat B-F-SubPc and B-ClSubPc have almost the same absorption profiles, suggesting that axial fluorination does not alter the absorption characteristics.

Optoelectronic performances of the fabricated OPD devices
The fabricated green-light-selective OPD cells comprise an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass bottom substrate, an electron-blocking layer (5 nm), a donor–acceptor BHJ layer, and a top ITO electrode, as shown in Fig. 1b. The structure of the device was confirmed to have a perfect layer by layer configuration via high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images as shown in the upper right corner of Fig. 1(b).51 The magnified view of the active layer for fabricated blends indicates no remarkable microscopic features, suggesting that introducing axial fluorination does not produce morphological differences in active layers no matter what kind of acceptor it is blended with. Additionally, the embedded Fast Fourier transform (FFT) images also exhibited a similar amorphous signature, consistent with the TEM results (Fig. S2, ESI†).
The current density–voltage, J–V, curves of the OPD cells under dark conditions are presented in Fig. 1c, and details of the photoelectronic characteristics are given in Table 1. It is clear that the B-F-SubPc-coupled OPDs exhibit a much lower dark current density (Jd) than the unsubstituted B-Cl-SubPc-coupled OPD cells at each applied inverse bias, regardless of the type of employed acceptors. Generally, Jd is mainly attributed to the electron (or hole) injection from the contact electrode to the tail state of the Gaussian density of state (DOS) of the acceptor LUMO (or donor HOMO).33,49 Noticing that an electron blocking layer (EBL) as shown in Fig. 1b has been employed to suppress the electron injection, hole injection should be considered to cause dark current. First, the hole injection barrier (Φb), normally defined as the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the Fermi level of the corresponding cathode was compared. The HOMO energy levels of the donors shown in the energy diagram (Fig. 1b) were measured by employing ambient photoemission spectroscopy (APS) measurements.37 Notably, the axial fluorination of SubPc does not drastically alter the HOMO levels (Fig. 1d), showing a consistent result with the literature.37 Thus, another factor, energy disorder which also impacts the injection barrier was further compared for B-F-SubPc and B-Cl-SubPc samples. Here, sub-band gap tail states resulting from energy disorder were extracted from the APS measurements, in which the area below the HOMO threshold was integrated. These sub-band gap tail states were also regarded as shallow trap states according to the location of its energy level within the bandgap. As expected, the neat and blended films of B-F-SubPC (Fig. 1e), regardless of the type of acceptor, have smaller trap states, which is mainly indicative of the smaller energy disorder. This reduced trap state is considered to be an effective charge injection barrier, resulting in a reduced Jd.49

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) results as a function of wavelength at a reverse bias of 3 V are shown in Fig. 1f. All the OPD cells exhibit prominent selectivity toward green incident light, indicating that the full-widths at half maximum (FWHMs) of their absorption spectra span a reasonably narrow range, as demonstrated in our previous work.7,9,10,12,16 The FWHMs of the OPD blends including C60 are much narrower than those of the OPD blends including Cl6-SubPc, in good agreement with the absorption coefficient profiles. The right graph of Fig. 1f shows a plot of the maximum EQE, EQEmax, as a function of the applied reverse bias; there is a remarkable increase in efficiency with reverse bias, regardless of the type of acceptor. This enhancement in the EQE can be attributed to an increased electric field-dependent charge carrier mobility, which results in higher charge separation ηcs and charge collection ηcc efficiencies because of the minimization of charge recombination loss.9,49 Furthermore, the OPDs coupled with the C60 acceptor exhibited marginally higher EQE values than those coupled with the non-fullerene Cl6-SubPc acceptor; a similar trend was observed for the B-F-SubPc-based OPDs compared to the B-Cl-SubPc-based OPDs. Typically, the EQE is estimated using eqn (1): EQE = ηa × IQE = ηa × ηcs × ηcc(1)where ηa is the experimentally measured absorption of the BHJs (B-F-SubPc/C60 blend: 72.6%, B-Cl-SubPc/C60 blend: 72.7%, B-F-SubPc/Cl6-SubPc: 83.3%, and B-Cl-SubPc/Cl6-SubPc: 84.5%), and IQE is the internal quantum efficiency calculated as ηcs × ηcc; this quantity is strongly affected by the charge carrier mobility.52 Although the C60-coupled blends and B-F-SubPc blends exhibit lower absorption than the corresponding blends (the Cl6-SubPc-coupled and SubPc blends, respectively), their IQE values are sufficiently high enough to compensate for this, and consequently, these blends have very similar or slightly increased EQEs. Accelerated charge transfer mobility between donor–acceptor pairs is believed to be important for increasing the IQE, and this will be discussed in the next section.
Photoresponsive behaviors of the fabricated OPD devices
The photoresponse time is a crucial parameter for image processing with OPD devices. Fig. 2a shows the time dependence of the remaining charge number (RC) for the fabricated OPD cells after the interruption of illumination. All the devices were exposed to illumination of a fixed wavelength and intensity, following which the incoming light was switched off. The residual photocurrent was plotted as a function of time to determine the temporal decay characteristics for each device. The B-F-SubPc-coupled OPD cells exhibited faster decay than the B-Cl-SubPc-coupled OPD cells, irrespective of the acceptor used. The RC values shown in Table 2 were calculated from the residual photocurrent per unit area within 33 ms after the illumination was switched off; these values are in agreement with the time decay trend. In addition, to reveal the improved RC performance, the effective charge carrier mobility, which was derived from the RC plots based on extraction of the drift time for charge carriers, is shown in eqn (2):53,54 (2)where d is the thickness of the BHJ, Veff is the effective voltage drop, and t0 is the transit time for charge carriers calculated by considering that on average they drift through half of the photoactive layer before being extracted at the electrode; the resultant mobility values are shown in Table 2. The extracted charge carrier mobilities of the B-F-SubPc BHJs are evidently higher than those of the B-Cl-SubPc BHJs; additionally, those of the C60-coupled BHJs are almost two times higher than those of the non-fullerene acceptor-coupled BHJs. These trends for the extracted mobility are in agreement with the observed time decay performances of the RCs. When the illumination is switched off, free RC carriers remain in the device; the higher the extracted charge carrier mobility, the faster the decrease in the RC. This accelerated charge carrier mobility not only results in a rapid decay time, but could also help interpret the high IQE and resulting EQE values.

The photoresponse is plotted as a function of frequency under modulated light illumination in Fig. 2b, and the digital results are depicted in Table 2. When the OPD cells are driven by a reverse bias of 3 V, the −3 dB cutoff frequency of B-F-SubPc cells is much higher than those of the B-Cl-SubPc cells in the C60 and Cl6-SubPc-coupled systems. The same trend was observed in the cells not driven by any reverse bias (Fig. S3, ESI†). The axial fluorination of B-Cl-SuPC leads to an accelerated charge carrier mobility, and as a result, significantly enhanced photoelectronic performances.55 The faster decay time, evident in the RC results, together with the wider cutoff frequency response bandwidth for B-F-SubPc cells will facilitate the development of sequential image-capture devices that function at speeds of greater than 30 fps.
Surface photovoltage analysis of blend films
In addition to the characterization of these experimental devices, we performed contactless SPV measurements and determined the time evolution of the SPV signal to obtain transient optical absorption information, interfacial trap characteristics, and charge carrier lifetimes.30,33,34,37,38 All the samples included an outermost BHJ film (100 nm) along with an electron-blocking layer (EBL, 5 nm) on the surface of a conducting Ag-coated glass substrate. Before the measurement, the samples were loaded onto the measurement stage in a dark Faraday cage for at least 3 h to ensure that the influence of external illumination could be neglected in our subsequent analyses. Three sequential dark (400 s)/light (400 s) illumination cycles were then applied, using a wavelength of 545 nm. The SPV was quantified from the magnitude of the change in the CPD (ΔCPD) between the illuminated and dark conditions, and was detected as a function of time during the periodic dark and light pulses.

Fig. 3 is a plot of the normalized SPV for each semi stack under periodic dark and illuminated conditions. A stable normalized SPV profile is apparent in the dark state, confirming the complete elimination of interference from exposure to external light. As illustrated in the inset of Fig. 3, upon illumination, photocharged carriers are spontaneously generated within the BHJ layer and redistributed due to band bending. Holes drift actively and are transferred through the EBL layer to the bottom Ag substrate; however, electrons ultimately accumulate at the surface of the BHJ layer, and therefore generate a positive ΔCPD.37,40 This photoinduced charge carrier generation and redistribution process is sustained for a sufficient time to attain dynamic equilibrium. The B-F-SubPc blend samples responded more immediately to external illumination compared to the normal B-Cl-SubPc blends, implying that strong charge carrier generation and redistribution occurred. This observation was reproduced for isolated donor/EBL/Ag samples (Fig. S4, ESI†); a neat B-Cl-SubPc film was slower than a neat B-F-SubPc film in achieving the final charge equilibrium under periodic illumination.
 Fig. 3  Comparison of normalized surface photovoltaic spectra of fabricated blend films in half stacks under dark and illuminated conditions. The inset image is a schematic of the predicted charge transfer process. 
When the illumination was turned off, the electrons that accumulated at the surface recombined quickly with holes and returned to their original ground state, causing a time-dependent decay of the ΔCPD signal. The decay in ΔCPD seen in these plots consists of an immediate drop accompanied by a slow decrease, and these are considered to be related to the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and intrinsic charge trapping, respectively.38,39 Interestingly, the B-F-SubPc-based films show a much sharper drop in ΔCPD as well as less residual ΔCPD, irrespective of the type of acceptor used. Additionally, the aforementioned rapid decay performance of the B-F-SubPc-based films is more evident in the C60-coupled film than in the Cl6-SubPc films. Notably, as determined in our APS analysis for the dark current, the B-F-SubPc blend films and neat B-F-SubPc film contain fewer shallow trap states than the B-Cl-SubPc series of films. The shallow-trap density provides efficient charge trapping and reduces the mobility of the charge carriers. In other words, the fewer the shallow-trap states, the higher the mobility of the charge carriers. Thus, B-F-SubPc devices with fewer shallow-trap states have accelerated device mobility, resulting in improved photoresponse decay performances after illumination.
Computational MD and DFT predictions
In addition to the foregoing experimental work, we performed computational predictions, including DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to reveal the mechanism behind the improved charge-trap density for B-F-SubPc. The morphologies of the BHJ layers were generated by MD simulations. The MD simulations were performed with the OPLS force field using the Desmond MD package (Schrodinger, Inc.). Three hundred donor (B-Cl-SubPc or B-F-SubPc) and acceptor (C60 or Cl6-SubPc) molecules were randomly arranged in a simulation cell, and then the systems were annealed for 2 ns at 500 K using an NPT ensemble. After annealing, the systems were cooled gradually, over a period of 5 ns, to 300 K. The donor and acceptor molecules were found to be well mixed in the resulting morphologies, as shown in Fig. 4a.
 Fig. 4  DFT calculation results. (a) Snapshots of BHJ layer morphologies obtained by MD simulations, B-F-SubPc, B-Cl-SubPc, C60, and Cl6-SubPc are colored red, green, gray, and blue, respectively. (b) Distributions of the rates of electron hopping between acceptor molecules knn in B-F-SubPc/C60 (blue), B-Cl-SubPc/C60 (red), B-F-SubPc/Cl6-SubPc (sky), and B-Cl-SubPc/Cl6-SubPc (purple) morphologies. (c) Correlation between experimental SPV decay area and percentage of molecular pairs with a low hopping rate calculated by DFT calculations. Here, a low hopping rate is defined as log(knn) < 6. Distributions of the LUMO energy of C60 molecules in B-F-SubPc + C60 and B-Cl-SubPc + C60 morphologies. (d) Distributions of ΔE for C60 molecules in B-F-SubPc + C60 and B-Cl-SubPc + C60 morphologies. (e) Dipole moments of B-F-SubPc and B-Cl-SubPc molecules, respectively. 
To study the charge carrier transport in the BHJ layers, the rate of charge hopping between the molecules in the morphologies was calculated using Marcus theory as follows: (3)where Jij, λ, and ΔEij denote the transfer integral, reorganization energy, and energetic disorder, respectively. h, kB, and T denote Planck's constant, Boltzmann's constant, and temperature, respectively. The average values of the rate of electron hopping knn between acceptor molecules in the morphologies are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). The charge hopping rates were calculated using the parameters Jij, λ, and ΔEij obtained from DFT calculations for dimers of the acceptor molecules extracted from the morphologies with a cutoff distance of 4 Å for nearest neighbors. The average values of knn for C60 molecules are higher than those of Cl6-SubPc in BHJs containing B-F-SubPc or B-Cl-SubPc donors. This is because of the low reorganization energy and high transfer integral of C60, which is well known to be a superior electron-conductive material.56,57Fig. 4b shows the distributions of knn for each BHJ layer. For the materials containing C60, the knn distribution is significantly more intense than those for the materials containing Cl6-SubPc in the log(knn) range of 13–14, which indicates higher average values of knn and superior charge mobility for the C60 materials. However, charge trapping is an important factor for rapidly decreasing the SPV of organic semiconductors, because it causes a significant delay in charge mobility in the organic layers.46–48 Therefore, we estimated the amount of charge trapping sites from the distributions of the charge hopping rates.
In this study, the percentage of the electron trapping rate corresponding to log(knn) < 6 is considered to be important to charge trapping sites, because molecular pairs with a log(knn) lower than 6 are ∼106 times slower than average, rendering charge transport through these molecular pairs difficult. The proportion of molecular pairs with low hopping rates is shown in Table S2 (ESI†). We plotted the percentage of molecular pairs with log(knn) < 6 as a function of the SPV decay performance by integrating the decay area over a fixed time duration (when the illumination was switched off).
In Fig. 4c, the lower percentage of pairs with low hopping rates in the B-F-SubPc film blended with C60 is shown to correlate with its smaller SPV decay area, suggesting that the pairs with low hopping rates play critical roles in determining the decay trend during recovery from charge accumulation on the BHJ surfaces. The trend exhibited for the SPV decay area and electron hopping rate is also in agreement with the charge carrier mobility results: the F-SubPc blend film with enhanced charge carrier mobility has a lower proportion of pairs with low hopping rates, facilitating a higher charge carrier recovery rate after the illumination is stopped. A similar trend is not seen for the B-F-SubPc and B-Cl-SubPc films blended with Cl6-SubPc. This may be because the Cl6-SubPc acceptor pairs may exhibit slight differences in their characteristics when blended with B-F-SubPc and B-Cl-SubPc, hence we believe that the calculated values do not accurately distinguish the fluorination in this case. The effect of the fluorination of SubPc on the electron hopping performance as well as the charge carrier mobility and SPV decay trend is fairly remarkable in the C60 materials, confirming their superior electron conductivity.
Furthermore, to reveal the mechanism behind the enhancement of the charge mobility via fluorination of SubPc, we evaluated the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy distributions of the acceptor molecules and the energy difference ΔE between pairs of acceptor molecules in the morphologies obtained via the DFT calculations. We focused only on the LUMO energy and ΔE, because other parameters such as the reorganization energy and transfer integral of C60 molecules rarely change in these two types of systems. Fig. 4d shows the LUMO energy and ΔE distributions in the B-F-SubPc/C60 and B-Cl-SubPc/C60 BHJ layers. The LUMO and ΔE distributions of B-F-SubPc/C60 are narrower than those of B-Cl-SubPc/C60, indicating reduced energy disorder, which could be the origin of the smaller percentage of low-hopping-rate pairs. In contrast, the broad LUMO and ΔE distributions of B-Cl-SubPc/C60 are considered to be the reason for the greater number of charge trapping pairs, as has been well explained by Marcus theory. Typically, the energy distribution of C60 changes considerably according to its ratio in the donor–acceptor mixture, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), and with the dipole moment of the donor molecule. The energy distribution of C60 in the BHJ can be broadened by blending it with polar molecules such as SubPc. The simulated energy distributions agree well with the experimental trap state results extracted from the APS plot, in which a narrower distribution of ΔE for F-SubPc corresponds to a lower trap DOS. The effect of the fluorination of SubPc on the energy distribution was interpreted by comparing the dipole moments. As shown in Fig. 4e, the B-F-SubPc molecule has a smaller dipole moment (3.707 D) than the pristine B-Cl-SubPc molecule (4.955 D). Donor molecules with high dipole moments will inevitably induce a diversity of energy states for the C60 molecules in blend films, producing more trap states for charge carriers; this in turn leads to decreased charge carrier mobility and a decelerated photoresponse. The charge mobility in organic semiconductors can be increased by tuning the dipole moments of molecules.

The effects of the axial fluorination of B-Cl-SubPc (B-F-SubPc) on the photoelectronic performances of the OPD devices and their measured SPVs were investigated using experimental and computational methods. The B-F-SubPc-based OPD cells produced much lower dark currents and exhibited faster decay in the transient and frequency-dependent photoresponse measurements, along with accelerated charge carrier mobility. The novel method of SPV analysis with periodic illumination confirmed that the B-F-SubPc blend films underwent more rapid charge recombination and exhibited a reduced density of the remaining accumulated charge carriers. A comparison of the shallow-trap DOS data from APS measurements assisted in determining that fewer shallow-trap states results in reduced dark currents and a rapid decay in the photoresponse. Furthermore, advanced computational predictions of the energy disorder of the BHJ layer were obtained by performing DFT calculations and MD simulations. The theoretical results suggested that the dipole moments of the molecules strongly affected the energy distributions of the organic semiconductors, and that the photoresponses of organic image sensors can be improved by tuning the atomistic environments.
Experimental
Materials
Subphthalocyanine fluoride (B-F-SubPc) was synthesized according to a previously reported method with minor modifications.58 B-Cl-SubPc (5.5 g, 12.8 mmol) was added to a suspension of silver tetrafluoroborate (3.1 g, 16.0 mmol) in toluene (1.8 L) under a stream of N2, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 4 hours at 60 °C. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the volatile materials were removed under reduced pressure. This reaction was synthesized in two batches, after mixing the crude products of the two batches, the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane at reflux temperature by the soxhlet extraction process. After the solution was evaporated under reduced pressure, the crude product was washed with acetone, and then purified using silica–gel column chromatography to afford the desired product (6.5 g as a total amount of 2 batches, Y. 74.4%). The purity was up to 99%. The experimental data are in agreement with previously reported data. Prior to preparing device samples, the product was subjected to temperature gradient sublimation under a high vacuum.
Other reagents were purchased from commercial sources and were purified by thermal gradient sublimation before deposition. B-Cl-SubPc and peripheral Cl6-SubPc were obtained from Lumtec Corporation (TAIWAN). C60 was purchased from commercial suppliers (Frontier Carbon Corp.; purity >99.5%, sublimed grade) and used as received.
Fabrication of OPD devices and thin films
All the organic semiconductor materials were purified via sublimation under high vacuum (<10−6 Torr) prior to use. Thin films were fabricated via thermal evaporation under high vacuum (<10−7 Torr) at a rate of 0.35 Å/s on dried glass that had previously been cleaned with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and acetone in an ultrasonic bath. OPDs with conventional structures were fabricated on ITO-coated glass substrates by sequentially depositing a hole-extraction layer (5 nm), an organic BHJ donor:acceptor layer (100 nm, 1:1 w/w), an electron transport layer (2 nm), and an ITO electrode (10 nm). All the organic film layers were thermally evaporated under high vacuum (<10−7 Torr). The ITO electrodes were evaporated by magnetron sputtering before the devices were encapsulated within glass (98.5% transmittance). The active pixel size, defined by the orthogonal overlap of the two electrodes, was 0.04 cm2. For the SPV measurements, thin films were fabricated within half-stacks, in which the required organic materials were deposited sequentially on Ag-pre-coated glass, which acted as a conductive substrate for grounding.
Instrumentation and device characterization
The EQE was measured using a spectral incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system under monochromatic illumination from an ozone-free Xe lamp combined with an optical filter, and using a chopper frequency of 30 Hz. A calibrated Si-PD was used to measure the incident monochromatic 540 nm light intensity as 176 μW cm−2. The J–V characteristics of the OPDs were measured using a Keithley K4200 parameter analyzer (Keithley Instruments, Solon, OH, USA). The frequency response was evaluated using a measurement setup consisting of an oscilloscope with a bandwidth of 500 MHz (LeCroy Wavejet 352A, LeCroy Corporation, Chestnut Ridge, NY, USA), an AFG-2125 function generator (GW Instek, New Taipei City, Taiwan), and a green laser diode (λmax = 553 nm, power = 1 mW cm−2). RC values were measured as the difference between the current density responses in the dark and light under pulsed illumination. The pulsed illumination was provided by 530 nm light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The light intensity was 5000 lx. A potential bias of 3 V was applied by a Keithley 2400 source-meter, and the photocurrent was converted to voltage using a DLPCA200 current amplifier, from which the voltage output was measured by a Tektronix TDS3012C oscilloscope. RC [(charge number) μm−2 s−1] was calculated from the current density [C cm−2 s−1]. The effective average charge mobility was calculated from the RC plots.
Measurements of KP, APS, and SPV
Dark Fermi levels (the work function) were obtained using an APS04 APS system (KP Technology, UK). All measurements were performed under normal atmospheric conditions with a sensitive dual-mode KP. The KP, featuring a 2 mm-diameter gold tip, was calibrated using a cleaned silver reference. APS measurements were carried out with UV illumination using a monochromatic deuterium lamp source (tunable over 180–340 nm). The raw photoemission yields were corrected for offset and their cube roots of yield were obtained, following which the HOMO values were acquired from the extrapolated intersection of the linear fit and the baseline of the plot of the cube root of the photoemission yield versus energy. For the SPV measurements, illumination was achieved using a quartz halogen lamp (150 W) coupled by fiber optics.
