    AbstractFe2O3/TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysts with different mass ratios of Fe2O3vs. TiO2 were synthesized by impregnation of Fe3+ on the surface of TiO2 microrods and calcination at 300 °C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), photoluminescence spectra and X-ray diffraction (XRD) have been used to characterize the samples. The photocatalytic activities of Fe2O3/TiO2 heterocomposites, pure Fe2O3 and pure TiO2 were evaluated by the photodegrading efficiency of Orange II under visible light (λ > 420 nm). The experiments demonstrated that Orange II in aqueous solution was more efficiently photodegraded using Fe2O3/TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysts than either pure Fe2O3 or TiO2 under visible light irradiation. With an optimal mass ratio of 7:3 in Fe2O3/TiO2 the highest rate of Orange II photodegradation was achieved under the experimental conditions. We have also compared the photoelectric properties of Fe2O3/TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysts with that of pure Fe2O3 by surface photovoltage (SPV) and transient photovoltage (TPV) techniques. Based on the photovoltage responses, we discussed the influence of the hetero-interface between Fe2O3 and TiO2 on transfer characteristics of photogenerated charge carriers. We demonstrated that the formation of heterojunctions between Fe2O3 and TiO2 for Fe2O3/TiO2 composites was pivotal for improving the separation and thus restraining the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, which accounts for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity.
Introduction
Visible-light-driven photodegradation of organic pollutants has attracted much attention because of its potential value on efficient utilization of solar light and environmental purification.1–3 Many investigators are devoting themselves to the exploitation of photocatalysts that are efficient in harvesting of visible light. Among these photocatalysts, iron oxide with low band gap of 2.2 eV could absorb most of visible light and has the advantages of low cost and high chemical stability. It has been considered as a favorable semiconductor with potential applications in photocatalysis, water photoelectrolysis and so on. However, poor conductivity, and difficulty to separate and facility to recombine electron–hole pairs in iron oxide inhibit its promising applications.
In recent years, many approaches against its drawbacks have been made to improve the photoelectric properties of Fe2O3, one of them is to control the morphology and size of hematite. For example, Suanta et al. have synthesized one-dimensional nanostructural α-Fe2O3 nanotube arrays by a simple sonoelectrochemical anodization method and proved that they have tremendous potential to split water to generate hydrogen under solar light illumination owing to their better charge transport properties relative to other Fe2O3 architectures.4 Fan et al. have demonstrated that the size and shapes of single-crystalline α-Fe2O3 nanocrystals, controllable from nanotubes to nanorings, lead to remarkable contributions to their optical response, and the shape and size dependent optical properties have great potential in future nanophotonics applications.5 An alternative method is to dope other atoms to improve the photoelectric response of Fe2O3. For example, the photoresponse could be enhanced by doping silicon into the Fe2O3 thin film due to the substitution of Fe3+ by Si4+ in the hematite lattice, and thus its electric conductivity and the separation of the photogenerated charges are improved.6
In addition to the methods discussed above, many efforts have been focused on polycrystalline heterostructures, which are broadly applied in photocatalysis,7,8 solar cells9 and gas sensors,10etc. Under the influence of the heterojunction between two different materials, the electrons and holes could be separated effectively and directionally. As shown in a recent report,8 Fe2O3/SrTiO3 composite powders with optimum proportions exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than pure SrTiO3, Fe2O3 and TiO2 (P25) under visible light (λ > 440 nm) irradiation for effective interparticle electron transfer. Xu et al. have synthesized ZnO–CdS core–shell quantum dot heterostructures with extremely long exciton lifetimes for the spatial electron–hole separation between the core and shell by the type II band structure offset, which could be beneficial in fluorescence-based sensors, solar cells photovoltaics and so on.11 These photoelectric properties are closely related to the behaviors of photogenerated charges (photogenerated electron or hole transfer at the surface and interface of the materials). We could estimate the photoelectric properties, such as photocatalytic activity and photoelectric response, etc. through the analysis of photogenerated charge transfer behavior.
In this work, we have synthesized Fe2O3/TiO2 composites (with different mass proportions of Fe2O3vs. TiO2) with heterostructure and characterized the photocatalytic activity of the Fe2O3/TiO2 samples under visible light irradiation. Taking advantage of SPV and TPV techniques, the most appropriate and direct methods to characterize the behavior of the photoinduced charges and the optical properties under different wavelengths of irradiation, the photovoltaic properties of pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/TiO2 composites have been investigated comprehensively. We illustrate the relationship between the transfer behavior of photogenerated charges (at the surface of composites and interface among the Fe2O3 and TiO2 particles) and photodegradation activity of an organic dye. It is demonstrated that the formation of a hetero-interface between Fe2O3 and TiO2 enhances the photocatalytic activity and the spectrum-dependent photovoltaic properties have distinct effects on the photoactivity.
Experimental
1 Catalyst preparation

1.1 Synthesis of TiO2 microrods. 
TiO2 microrods were prepared using the method previously reported by Zou et al.12 with minor modification. 3 mL of tetrabutoxytitanium was added to 30 mL ethylene glycol in a round bottom flask. The solution was treated at 180 °C for 2 h under continuous magnetic stirring and a white slurry was formed. Then the solution was cooled to room temperature naturally. The final white solid products were centrifuged and washed with ethanol several times to ensure total removal of the excess ethylene and then dried at room temperature. The as-synthesized white solid products were titanium glycolate. Finally, the titanium glycolate precursor were calcined at 450 °C for 2 h to form TiO2 microrods.


1.2 Synthesis of Fe2O3/TiO2 composites. 
The preparation procedure of the Fe2O3/TiO2 composite was based on ref. 13. 30 mL of 0.3 M (or 0.6, 1.5 M) Fe(NO3)3·9H2O in ethanol was added to 1.5 g of the above TiO2 powders followed by stirring for 30 min at room temperature and then sonicating for 30 min. The ethanol was evaporated at 50 °C. Then the samples were calcined at 300 °C for 10 min. Next the samples were washed by ethanol thoroughly. Finally, the samples were calcined at 300 °C for 6 h. The loading of Fe2O3 in the composites was about 30, 50 and 70 wt% for 0.3, 0.6 and 1.5 M Fe(NO3)3·9H2O. We also prepared Fe2O3 without TiO2 for comparison purposes.

2 Characterization
The morphologies of the composites were obtained by scanning electron microscope (SHIMADZU) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TECNAI G2, FEI company). The structural properties were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) with a Shimadzu X-ray beam from Cu-Kα radiation at room temperature. Photoluminescence spectra of samples were taken on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (RF-5301(PC)S).
A lock-in based SPV measurement system consists of a monochromatic light source, a lock-in amplifier (SR830-DSP) with a light chopper (SR540), a sample cell and a computer. A low chopping frequency of ∼23 Hz is used. Constant light intensity (at each wavelength) was used in the ac SPV measurements, and the monochromic light intensity depended on the xenon lamp spectral energy distribution. The construction of the photovoltaic cell is a sandwich-like structure. In this experiment, we used a piece of blank conductive ITO glass as the counter electrode. The positive electrode of the lock-in input was always connected to the pole on the light incident side of the sandwich-like structure. The potential of the irradiated electrode with respect to the back electrode denotes the sign of the applied dc bias between the electrodes. The phase spectra were taken synchronously with SPV spectra by the computer. A DSI200 UV-enhanced silicon detector was used to calibrate the system to eliminate the possible phase shift that is not correlated to the SPV response, so that any phase retardation is only with respect to the phase of the light modulation and reflects the kinetics of the SPV response.14 All the SPV measurements were operated under ambient conditions and the raw date are not treated further.
Work function measurements were carried out on a scanning Kelvin probe system (KP Technology Ltd., Scotland, UK). The width of the gold reference probe was 1.8 mm, whose work function is 5.1 eV. The contact potential difference (CPD) between the sample and the probe was measured in the dark.
TPV measurements were carried out in a device which was described in our previous paper.15 A sample chamber resembling a parallel-plate capacitor consisted of the FTO substrate, samples, a piece of 10 μm thick mica and a platinum wire gauze electrode. A laser radiation pulse (wavelength of 355/532 nm and pulse width of 5 ns) from a third-harmonic Nd:YAG laser (Polaris II, New Wave Research, Inc.) was used to excite the TPV. The signals were registered by a 500 MHz digital phosphor oscilloscope (TDS 5054, Tektronix) with a preamplier. The formation of a TPV signal was determined by the factors of light absorption, transport of excess carriers, as well as structural and electric characteristics of the semiconducting material. The TPV measurements were performed in air atmosphere and at room temperature.
3 Photocatalysis and analysis
To investigate the visible light photocatalytic activity of the Fe2O3/TiO2 composites, a 500 W Xe lamp (cutoff at λ ≤ 420 nm) was used as a light source. Orange II was chosen as the test molecule. In a typical procedure, 50 mg of the composites were mixed in the 20 mL of 20 mg L−1 Orange II. The test solution was continuously stirred for 1 h in the dark to achieve adsorption equilibrium and 1 mL of the turbid solution was removed from the above solution to measure the absorption at regular intervals after the test solution was irradiated with visible light. The solution spectrum was measured on a 723 PC vis spectrophotometer. The Orange II in solution was analyzed by measuring its maximal absorbance at 485 nm.
Results and discussion
1 Characterization of Fe2O3/TiO2 composites
The morphologies of the pure TiO2 microrods and the Fe2O3/TiO2 composites are shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1a, the TiO2 microrods have a smooth surface and are about 1 μm in width and 5 μm in length, but are not regular. For comparison, the appearance of the Fe2O3/TiO2 composites with mass ratios of 3:7, 5:5 and 7:3 are shown in Fig. 1b, c and d, respectively, which indicate that Fe2O3 nanoparticles are attached to the surface of the TiO2 microrods to form a hetero-interface between the TiO2 microrods and Fe2O3 nanoparticles and the quantity of Fe2O3 coated on the surface of the TiO2 microrods increases gradually with mass ratio of Fe2O3vs. TiO2. From the HRTEM image (Fig. 1e) of the Fe2O3/TiO2 composite, we could clearly observe two different crystal lattices corresponding to anatase-TiO2 (d101 = 0.35 nm) and α-Fe2O3 (d110 = 0.25 nm).

The crystalline compositions of the samples are characterized by XRD patterns. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the pure TiO2, pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/TiO2 composites (with different mass ratios). From the XRD patterns we could conclude that the TiO2 microrods are composed of anatase. All the diffraction peaks of the pure Fe2O3 belong to pure hematite structure of Fe2O3 (α-Fe2O3). For the Fe2O3/TiO2 composites with different mass ratios, all the reflection peaks could be indexed to the hematite phase of Fe2O3 and anatase phase of TiO2, there is no appearance of a third phase. The composition of α-Fe2O3 is further confirmed by elemental analysis carried out from energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) (Fig. 1f). The results all show that Fe and O exist on the surface of TiO2 and form a continuous phase of Fe2O3.

2 Photocatalytic activity studies of Fe2O3/TiO2 composites

Fig. 3 illustrates the total concentrations of Orange II as a function of visible-light irradiation time of all the samples. Curve a represents the rate of dye photodegradation in the absence of any catalyst and a small quantity of dye is photodecomposed within 3 h. All the catalysts, including pure TiO2, pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/TiO2 hetero-photocatalysts with different mass ratios, are effective in dye photolysis. We considered the effect of adsorption on the dye degradation. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the dye adsorption on the photocatalysts in dark. We observed adsorption of dye for all the photocatalysts mainly takes place in the first hour. A small quantity of dye could be desorbed from the photocatalysts upon prolonging of the adsorption time. Since dye adsorption of most catalysts reached saturation after one hour we could ignore the influence of the adsorption on the photocatalytic activity. For the results of the Fig. 3, we have taken out the variation of dye concentration caused by adsorption. The photocatalytic activity of pure Fe2O3 is superior to pure TiO2, which could be attributed to the use of visible light (λ > 420 nm) to irradiate the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4 (curves a and b), Fe2O3 shows more absorption than TiO2 in the visible region and the Fe2O3 could generate more photo-generated charges than TiO2, facilitating the photodegradation of the organic dye. Compared with pure TiO2 and pure Fe2O3, the Fe2O3/TiO2 hetero-photocatalysts with different mass ratios all exhibit better photocatalytic activity than TiO2 or Fe2O3 alone, especially so the Fe2O3/TiO2 composite with mass ratio (Fe2O3vs. TiO2) of 7:3. An increase in mass ratio of Fe2O3vs. TiO2 (up to 7:3) thus leads to improved photocatalytic activity of the composite.

According to the SEM images of the photocatalysts (as shown in Fig. 1), the area of hetero-interface between the Fe2O3 and TiO2 increases with an increase of the quantity of Fe2O3 in the Fe2O3/TiO2 composite up to a mass ratio of 7:3. However, from the effect of photodegradation of Orange II by the Fe2O3/TiO2 composite with mass ratio of 9:1 (Fig. S1a, ESI†), we observe a decrease in photocatalytic activity relative to the composite with mass ratio of 7:3, owing to the fact that a large number of Fe2O3 nanoparticles could not form a hetero-interface with TiO2 due to the small quantity of TiO2 microrods (Fig. S1b, ESI†). It seems the effective formation of heterojunctions affects the photoelectric activity of the composite photocatalysts, which will be discussed in detail below from the aspect of the photoelectric properties.
3 The photoelectric properties of pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/TiO2 composites
The photocatalytic activities are closely related to the photoelectric properties of all the samples. We thus comparatively investigated the transfer properties of photo-induced charge carriers at the surface and interface of the pure Fe2O3, pure TiO2 and Fe2O3/TiO2 heterogeneous composites by using SPV and TPV techniques.

3.1 The surface photovoltage. 
The lock-in-based SPV measurement was first carried out to explore the photovoltaic properties of samples. Fig. 5 illustrate the surface photovoltage spectra and corresponding phase spectra of pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/TiO2 composites with different mass ratios under various biases. Generally, iron oxide (hematite or α-Fe2O3) is a typical n-type semiconductor that has a surface built-in electric field with the direction from the bulk to the surface, so that the photogenerated holes should be swept to the surface at the built-in electric field without an applied bias. However, for the pure α-Fe2O3 that we prepared via an ultrasonic method, the photogenerated electrons transfer to the surface based on the phase spectra. This abnormal photovoltaic polarity could be attributed to the function of surface states. The α-Fe2O3 could contain many surface states due to lattice defects or oxygen-deficiency at the surface of the nanostructures. The effect of the abundant surface states overwhelms that of the surface built-in electric field so that more photogenerated electrons move to the surface induced by the surface states.
 Fig. 5  The SPS spectra and corresponding phase spectra of pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/TiO2 composites with different mass ratios (Fe2O3vs. TiO2) under different biases of 0, 0.5, 1.0, −0.5 and −1.0 V. 
When negative biases are applied, some photogenerated holes move to the surface of the α-Fe2O3 under the action of the negative electric field. The effect of the negative biases is contrary to the surface states and weakens the action of the surface states and so that under negative biases weaker photovoltage responses than that without bias are observed. It could not overcome the effect of the surface states even if the negative bias is increased to −1.0 V and only decreases the intensity of the surface photovoltage response. We could conclude that the pure Fe2O3 has a large number of acceptor surface states which could induce a large number of photogenerated electrons to transfer to the surface. When the positive biases are applied, the effect of positive bias and acceptor surface states together contribute to making the photogenerated electrons move to the surface and which leads to the reversal of the electrical type. Therefore the photogenerated holes transfer to the surface instead of photogenerated electrons, as shown in the phase spectra. It is obvious that the effect of the surface states is very strong for pure Fe2O3.
For the Fe2O3/TiO2 composites, their surface photovoltage spectra show some changes relative to that of the pure Fe2O3, which would be connected with the formation of the hetero-interface between the Fe2O3 nanoparticles and the TiO2 microrods. As shown in Fig. 1, the Fe2O3 are coated on the surface of the TiO2 microrods and thus there is an appearance of an interface between them.
According the work functions of pure Fe2O3 and the pure TiO2 microrods we tested using KP technology, we conclude upon the relative locations of the conductive band, valence band and Fermi level and the transportation of photogenerated charges upon the action of the heterogeneous interfacial electric field. The photogenerated electrons and holes of the Fe2O3 could transfer to TiO2 and Fe2O3, respectively, at the interfacial region when the Fe2O3/TiO2 composite is illuminated with visible light, as illustrated by Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Schematic of the heterojunction formation under thermal equilibrium in the dark (a, b) and the separation and transport of charge carriers under visible light irradiation (c, d) between Fe2O3 and TiO2. 

Fig. 7 shows surface photovoltage spectra and corresponding phase spectra of Fe2O3, TiO2 and Fe2O3/TiO2 composites with different mass ratios without bias. The Fe2O3/TiO2 composites all have an obvious response at ultraviolet region (about 325 nm). Furthermore, the maxima of the SPV responses at the ultraviolet region appear at the same wavelength as for pure TiO2 microrods which may be attributed to hybridization of TiO2. The Fe2O3/TiO2 composite with mass ratio of 7:3 has the strongest intensity of SPV response at the visible region. From the phase spectra (Fig. 7b) we could observe that for lower mass ratio of Fe2O3vs. TiO2, the more phase retardation with respect to 180º becomes comparable with that for pure α-Fe2O3 from 360 to 300 nm. Those phenomena indicate that the trend of photogenerated electrons moving to the outer surface is weakened along with the decrease of Fe2O3 quantity coated on TiO2 microrods in the Fe2O3/TiO2 composite.14 We could explain this behavior from two aspects. First, the photogenerated holes are swept to the Fe2O3 in the Fe2O3/TiO2 composite under the interfacial electric field between Fe2O3 and TiO2 and this partly suppresses the strong effect of the surface states. Second, the quantities of the Fe2O3 nanoparticles coated on the TiO2 microrods are different for Fe2O3/TiO2 composites with various mass ratios. With regard to the Fe2O3/TiO2 composite with mass ratio of 3:7, the TiO2 microrods are only partially covered by Fe2O3 nanoparticles. As a result, exposed regions of TiO2 microrods could be excited by ultraviolet light directly and the photoexcited holes would move to the outer surface of the bare TiO2. This action could further restrain the effect of the surface states.
 Fig. 7  SPS spectra (a) and corresponding phase spectra (b) of pure TiO2, pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/TiO2 composites with different mass ratios. 
We could further verify the above conclusion by detailed observations on surface photovoltage spectra and corresponding phase spectra of Fe2O3/TiO2 composites under various biases. We choose the SPV spectra and corresponding phase spectra of Fe2O3/TiO2 composite with mass ratio of 3:7 as an example. Under zero bias, the contrary effect of the interfacial electric field and abundant surface states together contribute to the SPV response. The photogenerated electrons transfer to the outer surface, based on the phase spectrum, and for this reason that the effect of the surface states is stronger than the interfacial electric field. Under a small negative bias (−0.5 V), though the small negative bias could induce some photogenerated holes to move to the outer surface, which overcomes the affect of the surface states to a certain extent, it could not compensate the strong effect of surface states. When a −1.0 V bias is applied to the upper electrode, the SPV response is reversed in the visible region according to the phase spectra, and photogenerated holes transfer to the surface, which is distinct from that for pure Fe2O3. This phenomenon demonstrates that the electric field at the interface together with larger negative bias (−1.0 V) could overwhelm the effect of surface states. However, in the ultraviolet region, the transport direction of photogenerated electrons is opposite to that of at the visible region under −1.0 V bias. That could be attributed to the excitation of TiO2 under UV radiation with wavelengths under 370 nm. In this region, a part of photogenerated holes in TiO2 and photogenerated electrons in Fe2O3 might recombine at the interfacial region due to the band structures between the Fe2O3 and TiO2 as shown in Fig. 6c, which would weaken the effect of the interfacial electric field.
Under positive biases, the SPV amplitude decreases especially for the visible region compared with pure Fe2O3. When the positive bias is set at 1.0 V, the SPV response is nearly zero in the range of 600–370 nm. The effect of interfacial electric field with UV irradiation is weaker than that with visible illumination due to the recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes. In addition, the bare surface regions of TiO2 uncoated with Fe2O3 are excited directly under ultraviolet radiation, and the transport directions of the photogenerated carriers are opposite for visible and UV regions. Furthermore the effect of larger positive bias (1.0 V) and the surface states are extremely strong, reversing the transport direction of charge carriers, similar to pure Fe2O3. At the same time, the hetero-interfacial electric field for the Fe2O3/TiO2 composite has an opposing effect to the surface states and positive bias, so the weak SPV response is almost quenched in the visible region.
Due to the increase of Fe2O3 coated on the TiO2 microrods for the Fe2O3/TiO2 composites with mass ratio of 5:5 and 7:3 and the low UV light penetrating depth, the areas of bare surface of TiO2 uncovered by Fe2O3 decrease and less UV light could permeate Fe2O3 at the outer layer to reach the TiO2. As a consequence the impeding influence on the transportation of charge carriers under hetero-interfacial field by excitation of TiO2 under UV light irradiation weakens. One evidence for this effect is the quite different SPV spectral patterns for the Fe2O3/TiO2 composites with mass ratios of 5:5 and 7:3 under bias potential. By comparing the typical SPV spectra under −1.0 V bias, with increased mass ratio of Fe2O3 to TiO2, the SPV spectral patterns feature a larger contributing ratio by the visible region while the overall intensity declines steeply. The corresponding phase values of Fe2O3/TiO2 with mass ratio of 5:5 under −1.0 V are all in the range of −90 to 0° at wavelengths of 600–300 nm according to the SPV phase spectra, which means that the photogenerated holes are swept to the outer surface in the entire light-excited region.14 For the Fe2O3/TiO2 with mass ratio of 7:3 under −1.0 V, the corresponding phase values shift to −180° or even into another quadrant without regular monotonicity in the same spectral region, which means that more photogenerated electrons from Fe2O3 transfer to the outer surface, as in the case for the pure Fe2O3 sample.
From the above discussion, it could be deduced that the quantity of Fe2O3 coated on the TiO2 microrods affects the transportation of the photoinduced charge carriers at the interface region significantly. Under the effects of the interfacial electric field, surface states and applied biases, the SPS spectra exhibit different phenomena at various biases for Fe2O3/TiO2 composites with different mass ratios of Fe2O3vs. TiO2.


3.2 The transient photovoltage. 
The transient photovoltage technique was used to investigate the dynamic process of separation and transport of the photoinduced charge carriers at the surface and interface between the two components of the heterostructural composites. Fig. 8 shows the transient photovoltage (TPV) spectra of pure Fe2O3, pure TiO2 and Fe2O3/TiO2 composites with different mass ratios excited with a 532 nm laser. According to the TPV results, the pure TiO2 microrods have no response under visible light (532 nm) irradiation. For pure Fe2O3, a weak positive signal is initially observed at short times and then the TPV response is reversed at longer times. A positive TPV response implies that the potential of the irradiated electrode with respect to the counter electrode is positive, or that the positive charge carriers are accumulating at the top electrode, as based on the previous reports.16,17 α-Fe2O3 has a surface built-in electric field with the orientation of the bulk pointing to the surface and for this reason the photogenerated holes could be swept to the outer surface of the Fe2O3 by the surface built-in electric field. So the formation of a positive signal at the beginning of the TPV response is the effect of positive charge drift under the built-in electric field at the surface region.
 Fig. 8  The transient photovoltage of pure Fe2O3, pure TiO2 and Fe2O3/TiO2 composites with different mass ratios (Fe2O3vs. TiO2). The insert is the transient photovoltage spectrum of pure Fe2O3. The wavelength and power of the laser are 532 nm and 500 μJ. 
According to the conclusion discussed above, pure Fe2O3 has a weak surface built-in electric field and abundant surface states which are mostly acceptors that induce photogenerated electrons to the surface. Moreover, the diffusion length of the minority charge carriers (holes) in hematite is extremely short (about 4 nm).18 As a result, only the photogenerated holes in a shallow layer (<4 nm) of excited Fe2O3 could diffuse into the outer surface and the TPV response becomes negative at longer timescale because diffusion is the main driving force for separation and transport of photo-induced charge carriers. Furthermore, the photogenerated electrons and holes recombine quickly at 10−5 s as a result of the shorter diffusion length and slower diffusion rate of minority carriers in α-Fe2O3.
The TPV spectrum of the Fe2O3/TiO2 composite with mass ratio of 3:7 is similar to that of pure Fe2O3. It has an initially positive response with a stronger intensity than that of Fe2O3 and then the signal is reversed at 2.3 × 10−7 s. The enhanced TPV response relative to pure Fe2O3 at short time is ascribed to the formation of an electric field at the interface between Fe2O3 and TiO2 microrods. The photogenerated holes in the excited Fe2O3 move to the surface of Fe2O3 under the interfacial electric field, and added to the effect of the surface built-in electric field of Fe2O3, the intensity of Fe2O3/TiO2 composite is stronger than that of pure Fe2O3.
The negative response at longer times could be attributed to two reasons. One is the strong effect of surface states of Fe2O3 coated on the TiO2 microrods. On the other hand, as discussed, the TiO2 microrods are not wrapped completely by Fe2O3 and a part of the outer surface of TiO2 microrods is exposed. The photogenerated electrons are pinned to the interfacial region between Fe2O3 and TiO2 according to the schematic of heterostructural energy bands (Fig. 6c). Along with this accumulation of charge carriers, the downwards band bending of Fe2O3 might come back to flat gradually and the photo-induced electrons could then pass across the interface between Fe2O3 and TiO2 and transfer to the TiO2 microrods (as shown in Fig. 6d). Therefore, the free negative charge carriers could move to the bare surface of the TiO2 and a negative photovoltage response is observed at longer timescales. From the SPV spectrum, we could also observe that the recombination rate of Fe2O3/TiO2 composites with heterostructure is slower than that of pure Fe2O3. The effect of the interfacial electric field restraints the recombination of photogenerated carriers and so the photocatalytic activity of Fe2O3/TiO2 is superior to Fe2O3.
The TPV spectra of Fe2O3/TiO2 composites with mass ratios of 5:5 and 7:3 are not the same as that of composite with mass ratio of 3:7. There is only a negative signal within all ranges studied. The quantities of Fe2O3 coated on the TiO2 microrods are increased with mass ratio, especially for the composite with mass ratio of 7:3. In this instance, the laser light (532 nm) might not arrive at the interface between Fe2O3 and TiO2 and just a shallow layer of Fe2O3 at the surface could be excited. At this time, on the one hand the photoexcited electrons move to the surface under the influence of surface states and on the other hand the photogenerated holes excited at the surface region are swept to the interface region due to the effect of the interfacial electric field. Therefore the TPV responses of them are negative at the beginning. Even though the exciting light could reach to the interface region, the photogenerated holes might not overcome a layer of Fe2O3 coated on the TiO2 microrods to transfer to the outer surface owing to the short diffusion length of minority carriers in hematite.
At the same time, we also observe that the composite with mass ratio of 7:3 has stronger amplitude of TPV signal and faster response than the composite with mass ratio of 5:5. The recombination time of 10−5 s for the composite with mass ratio of 5:5 increases to 4.5 × 10−4 s for 7:3. So the heterostructured composite that has larger mass ratio of Fe2O3vs. TiO2 is in favor of separation of photogenerated charge carriers and inhibits the recombination of electron–hole pairs. These characteristics are manifested by the higher photocatalytic activity. The composite with mass ratio of 7:3 with the longest recombination time has the best performance in photocatalytic degradation of Orange II.
In addition, according to the room-temperature PL spectra of the pure Fe2O3, pure TiO2 and Fe2O3/TiO2 heterostructure composites with different mass ratios of 3:7, 5:5 and 7:3 (Fig. S2, ESI†), a wide emission band could be observed for all photocatalysts. Therefore, the TiO2 microrods have a much stronger emission intensity than any other photocatalysts and consequently the photoluminescence of the Fe2O3/TiO2 composites are mainly the contributions of the TiO2. The phenomena illustrate that the photoluminescence of TiO2 microrods is restrained upon formation of heterojunctions with Fe2O3. For the three different Fe2O3/TiO2 composites, the emission intensity decreases along with an increase of the mass ratio (Fe2O3vs. TiO2). Accordingly, much more photogenerated charge carriers are quenched to luminescence when there is less Fe2O3 coated on the TiO2 microrods. These results further demonstrate that the hetero-interface between the Fe2O3 and TiO2 in Fe2O3/TiO2 composite promotes the separation of the photoinduced charge carriers. Among the three composites, the Fe2O3/TiO2 composite with mass ratio of 7:3 has the weakest PL emission intensity and so it exhibits the best photocatalytic activity.

4 The relationship between photocatalytic activity and photoelectric properties
According to the analysis of the characteristics of the photogenerated charge carriers in the pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysts based on the SPS and TPV spectra, the relationship between the photovoltaic responses and the photocatalytic activity is addressed as follows. For pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysts, we observe that the separation and transport of photoexcited charges in Fe2O3/TiO2 composites exhibited some change under the effect of the hetero-interfacial electric field between Fe2O3 and TiO2 compared with pure Fe2O3, especially under the action of applied voltage biases. The photogenerated electrons and holes for the Fe2O3/TiO2 composites were easier to separate than for Fe2O3, which would be in favor of the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity.
For the dynamic model obtained from the TPV measurements of three Fe2O3/TiO2 composites, the different photovoltaic responses enable us to explain the different photodegradation rates. For the Fe2O3/TiO2 composites with different mass ratio of Fe2O3vs. TiO2, the quantity of Fe2O3 coating on the TiO2 varied, which leads to the modulation of interfacial electric field effect as well as its amount, so that the photovoltaic responses alters correspondingly. The more appropriate the mass ratio of the coated Fe2O3vs. TiO2 microrods was, the slower the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes became, and consequently the better the photocatalytic activity obtained.
We have demonstrated that the combinative SPV and TPV technologies are well-suited and direct methods to evaluate the photoelectric activity of the Fe2O3/TiO2 composites and reveal the underlying photo-induced charge transfer mechanism for the rational design of heterogeneous photocatalysts. These technologies have also been applied to other heterogeneous structures.9,19 For example, Zhang et al. utilized SPV and TPV technologies to study the formation of heterojunctions in BiOI/TiO2 composites and probe charge transfer between BiOI and TiO2. Finally, they revealed the heterojunction could promote the transfer of photoelectrons and thus inhibit their recombination with holes, leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity.19 It should be noted that the photocatalytic activity of Fe2O3/TiO2 was measured in liquid phase, while the SPV and TPV were carried out under ambient atmosphere in our case. The surface of the catalysts will have much more adsorbates from aqueous solution than the case under ambient atmosphere. Nevertheless, the characterization in atmosphere avoids the loss of photo-induced charges captured by solvent and solute. As such it is capable of providing abundant and useful information on the photo-induced charge generation and transfer behaviors in the materials, which are the key energy-conversion steps and essential to their subsequent participation in further photocatalytic reaction such as that in the liquid phase. Furthermore, we could also obtain information about the separation of the photogenerated charge carriers at the hetero--interface between the two different materials, which are not observed in the liquid phase for the fast chemical reaction of the photoinduced charges with dye molecules. It is found that the photocatalytic performances indeed have inherent correlation with the photo-induced charge generation and transfer behaviors in the catalysts, as shown in this work.
Conclusions
In summary, Fe2O3/TiO2 heterostructural composites with three mass ratios (Fe2O3vs. TiO2) of Fe2O3 nanoparticle covered TiO2 microrods were prepared. The photocatalytic experimental results revealed that the Fe2O3/TiO2 composites with heterostructure were more active than the corresponding bare Fe2O3 or bare TiO2 in the photodegradation of Orange II under visible light illumination. Furthermore, the higher the mass ratio of Fe2O3vs. TiO2 is (up to 7:3), the better the photocatalytic activity is for the composites. By comparing the photovoltaic property of pure Fe2O3 with that of Fe2O3/TiO2 heterogeneous composites, we observed that the hetero-interface between Fe2O3 and TiO2 imposed an important influence on the behaviors of photogenerated charge carriers.
Moreover, the characteristics of the photogenerated charges were associated with the photocatalytic activity. With respect to pure Fe2O3, the photoexcited electrons and holes of the Fe2O3/TiO2 composites were prone to separate under the effect of the interfacial electric field under visible light irradiation, which resulted in the enhanced photocatalytic activity of Fe2O3/TiO2 heterostructural composites. The quantity of the Fe2O3 coated on the TiO2 microrods influenced the interfacial electric field and thus the transfer behaviors of the photogenerated charges, as revealed by SPS and TPV characterizations. As a result, the photodegrading rates towards Orange II were distinct from each other for the Fe2O3/TiO2 composites with different mass ratios. Therefore, the results presented in this work may provide well suitable and more direct methods to evaluate the photoelectric activities of advanced materials for practical application such as photocatalysis.
