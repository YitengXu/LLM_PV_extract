    , Accepted 9th June 2016First published on 13th June 2016AbstractThe fabrication of p-type doped ZnO nanostructures is key in opening up substantial opportunities for the application of ZnO nanostructures. Owing to their stable p-type property, Na ions are the best candidates for ZnO p-type doping. However, Na-doped ZnO nanostructures had never been prepared until now. For the first time, we successfully synthesized Na-doped ZnO ultrathin hollow spheres using an ion adsorption and templating method. The obtained hollow spheres have ultrathin shells, uniform Na elemental distribution and a controllable concentration of doped Na. The energy position of the Fermi level decreased with continuously increasing Na doping concentration, revealing the p-type conductivity of Na-doped ZnO. We demonstrate that the photocatalytic hydrogen generation efficiency (with methanol) using ZnO ultrathin hollow spheres can be enhanced by more than 50 times after Na-doping and that the quantum efficiency can be as high as 13.5%.
Introduction
ZnO nanostructures are widely used in solar cells,1,2 photoluminescence,3 photocatalysis,4,5etc. To satisfy the demands of different applications, doping such materials with specific elements is an essential method in which to control and manipulate the properties of ZnO nanostructures.6–8 n-type and p-type doping could change the band structures and the transportation properties of the carriers, etc., in ZnO nanostructures.9,10 Thus, the synthesis of n-type and p-type doped ZnO nanostructures is key in opening up substantial opportunities for nano-optic and electronic applications. However, ZnO has an asymmetric doping limit. It can be easily doped as n-type, but remains strongly resistant to p-type doping.11,12 For realizing various applications, it is imperative to have p-type doped ZnO nanostructures. Owing to its excellent doping stability and shallow acceptor energy level,13 Na is theoretically an excellent candidate for p-type incorporation into ZnO. However, only a few n-type elements have thus far been successfully doped into ZnO nanostructures, let alone p-type elements such as Na.14 Many synthetic methods have been developed for preparing ZnO nanostructures heterogeneously doped with other elements.15–17 Among those synthetic techniques, solution based methods are an efficient and economical way to prepare metal-doped ZnO nanostructures.18 In solution based methods, the key to synthesising metal-doped ZnO nanostructures is to control the precipitation rates between the Zn ions and the doped metal in order to gather them together uniformly.19 However, the chemical activities of Zn and Na in solution differ from one another. Importantly, Na ions even remain unprecipitated in solution. Both types of metal ion can not be precipitated simultaneously. This is the main reason for which Na-doped ZnO nanostructures can not be obtained through existing solution based methods. In view of the adsorption model, any soluble metal ion can be adsorbed onto the surface of a template.20–23 The adsorption process is thus available for collecting Na and Zn ions together, which can be used instead of the co-precipitation process one would use for the solution based synthesis of Na-doped ZnO. As shown in Fig. 1, we could use the adsorption method to gather the Zn and Na ions together on the surface of carbon spheres. Furthermore, the –OH and –CO groups on the surface of the carbon spheres do not have any selective adsorption properties, meaning that the different metal ions are distributed evenly on the surface at the atomic scale,22 which provides a foundation for uniform doping.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the preparation of Na doped ZnO hollow spheres. 
Herein, after removing the carbon cores, uniform Na-doped ZnO ultrathin hollow spheres were successfully obtained for the first time, using our ion adsorption and templating method. The Na dopants were found to significantly affect the work function of ZnO and the relative energy position of the Fermi level in the ZnO band gap. This is the first report on the relationship between Na doping concentration and Fermi level position. Moreover, we found that after Na doping the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen generation can be enhanced by more than 50 times compared with pure ZnO hollow spheres.
Experimental
Materials synthesis
The carbon spheres were hydrothermally synthesized using the method reported by Sun et al.24,25 To synthesise the Na-doped ZnO (Na-ZnO) hollow spheres, 50 mg of as-prepared carbon spheres were dispersed in 100 mL of deionized water by ultrasonication before Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and Na(NO3) were added. The as-obtained mixture was stirred for 24 h. A rinsing process involving two cycles of centrifugation/washing/re-dispersion was performed with water. After drying in an oven in air at 80 °C for 6 h, the Na-ZnO hollow spheres were obtained by calcinating the products in air at 400 °C for 12 h. The ratio of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O to Na(NO3) in the solution was regulated in order to gain a series of materials with different concentrations of Na ions doped into the ZnO. The as-prepared catalyst was modified with Pt (∼5 at%) as a cocatalyst for water splitting. Briefly, the Pt was loaded from a moderate amount of H2PtCl6 using the impregnation method, and the resulting material was then reduced in H2 at 400 °C for 4 h. To reduce the number of oxygen vacancies, we annealed all of the samples at 400 °C under an O2 flow (200 mL min−1). After 8 h of oxidation, the samples were cooled to room temperature under an O2 flow.
Materials characterization
ICP-AAS measurements were used to analyze the ratio of Zn to Na in the samples, after digesting the Na-ZnO hollow spheres in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (termed solution A). The Na ions were present in pure HCl solution (termed solution B), and therefore the Na concentration was obtained by subtracting the Na concentration in B from the Na concentration in A. The structural properties of the Na-ZnO hollow spheres were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM). The chemical states of the samples were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the EF − EV value was determined by VBXPS. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded in KBr dispersion in the range 340–2500 cm−1. The work function was measured by UPS and He I (21.22 eV) was utilized as a photon source for the UPS measurement; the cut-off edge in the UPS test was chosen at the position with the highest derivative value. The band gap was calculated by UV-vis diffuse reflectance experiments, which were carried out on an ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer.
Photocatalytic reactions
Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a Pyrex reaction vessel connected to a gas circulation system at room temperature and Ar was used as a carrier gas. The photocatalytic conversion of H+ to H2 in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor (methanol) was examined as the test reaction. H2 evolution reactions were investigated using 100 mL of a 10 vol% methanol and 90 vol% aqueous solution containing 20 mg of the samples. The reaction started without mechanical stirring and the catalyst powder formed sediment on the bottom of the reaction cell. The light source was a 300 W xenon lamp and the photoenergy was 95 mW cm−2. The solution was kept at 4 °C using a water bath system. The evolved gases were analyzed by gas chromatography (TCD).
Quantum efficiency
The quantum efficiency was calculated using the following equation: Φ (%) = (2 × R/I) × 100, where R and I represent the number of evolved H2 molecules and the number of absorbed photons in 1 hour, respectively. Here, Φ is the quantum efficiency. The light source was a 300 W xenon lamp attached with a band pass filter (λ = 350 ± 15 nm). The power of the light irradiation was measured by a thermopile, which was located at the bottom of the reaction cell. The light irradiation energy measured by the thermopile was 0.27 mW cm−2. Therefore, the total light energy absorbed in one hour was 17.5 J. We assumed the average energy of a photon to be 3.54 eV (λ = 350 nm). The number of absorbed photons should be 3.08 × 1019 h−1, which was considered as the I value. For the best Pt/Na-ZnO hollow spheres, the rate of H2 evolution was 3.47 μmol h−1 using the above-mentioned power. Therefore, the total number of evolved H2 molecules in 1 h was 2.08 × 1018 (R). Thus, based on the calculation, the Φ was 13.5%.
Results and discussion
The Na concentrations in our synthesized Na-ZnO nanostructures were gradually varied from 0 to 0.2, 0.7, 2 and 4% (Na/Zn + Na, at%, ICP-AAS measurements). Corresponding XRD patterns revealed that the Na-ZnO nanostructures with different Na doping concentrations are composed of a pure hexagonal wurtzite phase, as opposed to physical mixtures of sodium oxide and ZnO (Fig. 2a). Typical SEM images of 0.7% Na-ZnO nanostructures showed that the samples were grown in a hollow sphere morphology (Fig. 2b) and that the size of the hollow spheres was in the range 150–220 nm. The other Na-ZnO samples (0, 0.2, 2 and 4% Na-ZnO) also grew in this hollow sphere morphology, as shown in Fig. S1.† TEM imaging of an individual hollow sphere (Fig. 2c) indicated that the thickness of the shell was 9 nm; the corresponding specific surface area was 199 m2 g−1 (Fig. S2†). The ultrathin hollow sphere morphology could shorten the carriers’ diffusion distance and increase the number of catalytic surface sites, thus enhancing the photocatalytic performance. HR-TEM imaging of the 0.7% Na-ZnO hollow spheres showed the d-spacing of the lattice fringe to be 0.531 nm (Fig. 2d), which is slightly different to the corresponding data for the (001) plane in pure ZnO.26 We believe that this difference is caused by the difference in size between the Na atom and the Zn atom. The XRD peaks also showed that Na incorporation could widen the lattice spacings of ZnO (Fig. S3†).

Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping could not distinguish the distributions of Na and Zn.9 As a powerful spectroscopic tool, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) could help us to verify or deny the existence of accumulated Na based secondary phases in the Na-ZnO hollow spheres (Fig. 3). The bands corresponding to pure ZnO and pure Na2O are located at 500 cm−1 and 890 cm−1 and 1430 cm−1, respectively.27,28 In the Na-ZnO samples, the main band is located at 500 cm−1 and is attributed to ZnO. Furthermore, no bands corresponding to pure Na2O were found in the Na-ZnO samples, which reveals a lack of precipitated Na2O particles and clusters in our Na-ZnO samples, confirming that the Na ions in ZnO are in a uniformly doped form, rather than precipitated as secondary phases. Additionally, new peaks at 1400–1700 cm−1 appeared in the Na-ZnO spectra. Furthermore, the stretching vibrations are clearly different from those of Na–O in pure sodium oxides. These bands may be attributed to the presence of NaZn–O stretching vibrations. Conclusively, we successfully prepared Na-ZnO ultrathin hollow spheres with tunable Na content.

The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the Na-ZnO hollow spheres with different doping concentrations are presented in Fig. S4.† We found that the adsorption edge shifted to shorter wavelengths with increasing Na content. The adsorption onset blue shifted from 377 nm (3.29 eV) for pure ZnO to 360 nm (3.45 eV) for 4% Na-ZnO. This demonstrates that Na doping had a widening effect on the band gap of ZnO, which is the first time this has ever been reported. Furthermore, for low levels of Na ion doping (lower than 1%), the Na-ZnO band edge shifted only by 0.02 eV. Therefore, a small amount of Na doping might not change the energy levels of the ZnO conduction band minimum and valence band maximum significantly.
Typical XPS spectra of the pure ZnO and 2% Na-ZnO hollow spheres are presented in Fig. 4a. All of the peaks in the spectrum of the pure ZnO nanostructures are ascribed to only Zn, O and C and a clear Na 1s peak can be observed in the spectrum of the 2% Na-ZnO hollow spheres. Fig. 4b displays the high-resolution spectrum for the Na doping element. The binding energy of Na 1s was found to be 1073.5 eV, which is similar to the reported binding energies of Na+ in Na2O.29 This indicates that the valence state of the doped Na is +1. Meanwhile, the binding energy deviated from the corresponding value for the synthesized sodium oxide,29 corresponding with the FT-IR data in Fig. 3.

Reducing the Fermi level was key for p-type doping in ZnO nanostructures. We measured the state density of the valence band in the pure and Na-doped ZnO hollow spheres using valence band XPS (Fig. 4c). The high value of EF − EV (2.9 eV) for the pure ZnO nanostructures demonstrates their n-type nature. Furthermore, the EF − EV value for the Na-ZnO nanostructures varied from 2.9 to 0.6 eV with increasing Na dopant incorporation, revealing that Na incorporation could significantly reduce the relative energy position of the Fermi level in the band gap.
Moreover, the work function test could precisely determine the energy position of the Fermi level. We used the UPS measurement to test the work functions of the Na-ZnO samples. The vacuum level (Evac) should be located 21.22 eV above the cutoff energy (Ecutoff) of the spectrum. According to the function illustrated in Fig. 5, the work function (Φ) of pure ZnO was estimated to be 4.48 eV, which is in good agreement with the literature.30 Based on the above calculation, the Φ was determined to be 4.81, 5.22, 5.99 and 6.19 eV for the 0.2%, 0.7%, 2%, 4% Na-doped ZnO samples, respectively. Thus, valence band XPS and UPS revealed that the Fermi level was reduced with Na incorporation, showing the clear p-type doping effect of Na in the Na-ZnO nanostructures.

Interestingly, we found that Na doping could significantly affect the photocatalytic hydrogen generation performance of ZnO hollow spheres. Fig. 6a shows photocatalytic H2 generation over time for the Na-ZnO samples, with methanol as a sacrificial electron donor. The pure ZnO hollow spheres decorated with Pt (ZnO/Pt) were found to produce 26.7 μmol g−1 of H2 in the first hour. After doping Na into ZnO, we found that the Na-ZnO/Pt hollow spheres showed significantly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen generation under the same conditions. Among them, the 0.7% Na-ZnO/Pt material exhibited the highest performance. The rate of H2 evolution reached 1380 μmol g−1 h−1 in the first hour and the apparent quantum efficiency was 13.5% under 350 nm wavelength irradiation (Fig. 6b). The rate of H2 generation was 51 times higher for Na-ZnO/Pt than for pure ZnO/Pt. We found that the H2 evolution rate increased sharply with increasing Na doping concentration for relatively low doping levels (0.2 and 0.7%) and then decreased upon further increases in the Na doping concentration (2 and 4%). The apparent quantum efficiency also decreased significantly with increasing Na incorporation after 0.7% (Fig. 6b). We believe that this might be owing to the severe recombination of the photo-generated carriers with increasing Na content. The H2 evolution rate for pure ZnO did not change over a continuous 8 hour test. On the other hand, the rate of H2 generation decreased quickly for the Na-ZnO samples. The amount of H2 generated in the 5th hour for the 0, 0.2, 0.7, 2 and 4% Na-ZnO hollow spheres was 80%, 11%, 8%, 9% and 7% percent of that generated in the first hour. In the photocatalysis tests for the Na-ZnO samples, ICP-AAS detected that the Na ions were present in the solution after photocatalytic testing, revealing dissolution of the doped Na+ during the test. We believe this to be the main reason for the low stability of the Na-ZnO samples.

Conclusions
In summary, using the ion adsorption and templating method, we successfully synthesized Na-doped ZnO ultrathin hollow spheres with a 9 nm thick shell and a corresponding specific surface area of 199 m2 g−1. The work function decreased from 4.48 eV to 6.19 eV and the EF − EV value varied from 2.9 to 0.6 eV upon increasing the Na concentration from 0 to 4% in the ZnO ultrathin hollow spheres. This demonstrated that Na has a clear p-type doping effect on ZnO hollow spheres. Moreover, we found that Na doping could increase the photocatalytic hydrogen generation of ZnO hollow spheres. 0.7% Na-ZnO/Pt exhibited the highest rate of photocatalytic H2 generation, 1380 μmol g−1 h−1, which was 51 times higher than that of the pure ZnO/Pt hollow spheres with the same ultrathin hollow sphere morphology. The apparent quantum efficiency was 13.5% under 350 nm wavelength irradiation.
