    , Accepted 11th December 2017First published on 11th December 2017AbstractCerium oxide, solution processed at a low temperature (∼100 °C), was successfully employed as an electron extraction layer on top of a perovskite. The CeOx layer shows good charge selectivity and increases light reflection from an Ag electrode. Besides this, the CeOx layer not only protects the perovskite from water, but also acts as a dense diffusion barrier to prevent the corrosion of the metal electrode.
Recently, perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have undergone rapid development and have attracted enormous attention, with their efficiency increasing from 3.8% to 22.1%.1–5 Perovskites have various advantages, such as a long diffusion length, high carrier mobility, broad absorption and solution processablity.6,7 Efficient printed PVSCs, synthesized on a large scale, have been reported by different groups,8–10 indicating that the commercialization of PVSCs is promising. Material which can be fabricated at a low temperature from solution is essential to the printing process. In a traditional n–i–p structure, mesoporous TiOx, prepared at a high temperature (>500 °C), is widely used as an electron extraction layer (EEL),11 which constrains its application to roll-to-roll production and flexible devices. Meanwhile, it has been shown that hysteresis behavior always occurs in a planar device based on a compact TiOx EEL.12 Tin Oxide (SnOx) has also been utilized as an EEL in devices.4,13 Recently, SnOx prepared by atomic layer deposition exhibited good electron selectivity,14,15 but the high cost of the fabrication process will inhibit its commercial appeal.
In a p–i–n planar structure, high temperature prepared n-type metal oxide is no longer suitable. Besides, inorganic nanoparticles or precursor are always dispersed or dissolved in alcohol solvent, which will damage the perovskite film underneath. Specifically, ZnO was reported as an EEL on top of a perovskite synthesized by spin coating using a nanoparticle dispersion.16 However, other literature sources have proved that the perovskite decomposed through contact with ZnO.17,18 Hence, organic semiconductors are commonly used on top of perovskite as an EEL, such as PCBM,19,20 perylene diimide based polymers,21 fullerene derivatives,22 and polyelectrolyte.23 Among them, PCBM and fullerene derivatives are most popular, with their suitable energy alignment and simple fabrication. It is worth noting that small molecules suffer from aggregation at high annealing temperatures, so when used in a solar cell, this effect leads to a decrease in the stability of the cell interface. Besides this, pin holes are easily formed during spin coating.
Cerium oxide (CeOx) is a n-type semiconductor with a wide bandgap, good transparency, high-temperature stability and low cost.24 It has been utilized in different areas, as a photoelectrode,25 light absorber in organic-dye-free solar cells,26 electrochemical displays,27 and catalysts.28 Recently, CeOx has been employed as an EEL in PSCs with a n–i–p structure,29 in which CeOx is heated in air at 150 °C for 15 min. According to the literature, a nanostructured CeOx/Al back electrode could improve the light trapping ability of solar cells.30 In this case, CeOx should be applied as an EEL on top of the perovskite layer in a p–i–n structure, avoiding thermal annealing in air. Herein, one simple but effective method of employing a CeOx/Ag top electrode in p–i–n structured planar PVSCs to improve their efficiency and stability was demonstrated. Instead of using PCBM, CeOx was spin-coated on perovskite as an EEL by heating in N2 at 100 °C for 10 min. Homogenous CeOx film not only protects the perovskite from water, but also enhances the light trapping ability of the device. The p–i–n structure planar PVSCs with a CeOx EEL show an improved performance with an average efficiency of 16.1% (in a reverse sweep) in comparison to PVSCs based on a PCBM EEL.
The fabrication procedure of the CeOx film is presented in Fig. 1 and the synthetic details are explained in the Experimental section. In our work, a CeOx film was applied as an EEL on top of a perovskite layer, replacing the normal PCBM EEL. In order to investigate the composition of the CeOx, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out (ESI,† Fig. 1S). According to the literature and the equation (ESI,† Fig. 1S),31–35 the concentration of Ce3+ in the Ce 3d spectrum is estimated to be 0.38, so x in the obtained CeOx is 1.81.

A suitable energy level is very critical for the EEL in solar cells, which could facilitate the transport of electrons.36 As shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†), no obvious absorption was observed in the visible light range and the optical band gap was obtained from the UV-vis absorption spectrum.37 Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed to verify the work function of CeOx. According to a reported method,38,39 the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of CeOx is 7.69 eV. As a result, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level was calculated by combining the optical band gap and HOMO energy level, which is shown in Table S1 (ESI†). In this work, PCBM was also used as an EEL for comparison. The architecture of the device is shown in Fig. 2. NiOx was employed as a hole transport layer. Compared to the PCBM EEL, CeOx shows a better energy level alignment with perovskite because it has a lower HOMO energy level, indicating an effective ability to block holes.

The current–voltage characteristics of the PVSC based on CeOx and the PCBM EEL are shown in Fig. 3a and the corresponding parameters are illustrated in Table 1. In this work, the thickness of CeOx was also tested by changing the spin speed. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and Table S2 (ESI†), the best performance was obtained based on CeOx with a spin speed of 3000 rpm. A cross-sectional scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of the optimized p–i–n PVSC stack with CeOx as an EEL is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The thickness of the CeOx layer is about 60 nm. A graphical representation of the device statistics is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Compared to the devices based on a PCBM EEL, the devices based on a CeOx EEL show a better performance with the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) at 17.1%. Improved Jsc and FF values contributed to an enhancement in the PCE, rather than the Voc which basically remained unchanged. In an attempt to study the electron extraction ability of the CeOx EEL, an electron-only device was fabricated and the architecture of the device is shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). TiOx was used on ITO to allow the injection of electrons from the bottom of the device into the perovskite. An electron-only device based on PCBM was also investigated for comparison. Under the same conditions, the electron-only device with CeOx exhibits a higher electron-only current in the dark, implying more efficient electron extraction from the perovskite. Besides, a significant quenching effect was observed in the perovskite/CeOx sample and the photoluminescence intensity of the perovskite/CeOx was much lower than that of pristine perovskite, further proving that CeOx can extract electrons effectively from the perovskite (ESI,† Fig. S7). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the device based on the CeOx EEL (Fig. 3b) exhibits a higher value, which is consistent with the higher Jsc. As discussed above, the CeOx EEL has a better energy alignment with the perovskite, facilitating the charge extraction. Besides, the higher light trapping ability of the perovskite could be another reason for the enhancement of the EQE spectrum, which will be discussed below.

In order to image the surface morphology of the perovskite with the EEL on top, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements have been performed and the AFM images are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The pure perovskite film shows a homogeneous surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 7.23 nm, while the surface becomes smoother with the PCBM EEL or CeOx EEL on top. Compared to the perovskite/PCBM film, the surface of the perovskite/CeOx film is rougher with an inverted corn nanostructure,30 delivering a RMS roughness of 5.45 nm. In this case, the surface area of the perovskite/CeOx film is larger than that of the perovskite/PCBM film. As reported, the larger surface area could increase the contact area with the vacuum deposited Ag electrode and potentially decrease contact resistance,40 explaining the higher FF value of the device based on the CeOx EEL. The reflectance spectra of the devices based on the PCBM EEL or CeOx EEL are shown in Fig. 4a. The device based on the CeOx EEL shows a lower reflectivity than that of the device based on the PCBM EEL, indicating that a higher degree of light trapping exists in the device with the CeOx EEL (Fig. 4b). In order to further investigate the function of the CeOx EEL, the reflectance spectra of the devices (ITO/PCBM/Ag and ITO/CeOx/Ag) were measured. As shown in Fig. 4c, the reflectivity of the device with CeOx is much higher than that of the device with PCBM. In another words, the insertion of CeOx causes an increase in the light reflection from the Ag electrode due to its inverted corn nanostructure.30

Finally, the stabilities of the devices were investigated. All the devices were stored under nitrogen at 25 °C without encapsulation. However, the device performance was measured in air. The PCE of the devices based on PCBM decreased by 80% after 160 hours (Fig. 5). In contrast, the devices based on CeOx are much more stable, retaining more than 90% of the PCE after 200 hours. Generally, water can damage CH3NH3PbI3 and cause decomposition, forming HI, CH3NH2 and PbI2.41 Hence, decomposition was hard to avoid when the devices were exposed to air. But, the results reveal that the devices based on the CeOx EEL are more stable. In terms of the prevention of decomposition, in order to understand the role of CeOx in the process, the aged devices were further studied. The devices based on PCBM and CeOx EELs were exposed to air for 24 hours. As shown in Fig. 6, many pin holes appeared on the Ag film of the aged device based on PCBM, but no obvious morphology changes were observed on the Ag film of the aged device with CeOx as the EEL. According to the literature, organic charge transport layers (such as PCBM) are not dense enough to protect against water and to completely isolate the perovskite and electrode layers from one another.42 So, the perovskite decomposition products go through the PCBM EEL and corrode the Ag top electrode. Dense CeOx not only protects the perovskite from water, but also acts as a diffusion barrier to prevent the corrosion of the metal electrode. The schemes shown in Fig. 6 depict the specific differences between PCBM and CeOx when used as an EEL in devices exposed to air.

In summary, efficient p–i–n structured perovskite solar cells were demonstrated by employing a solution-processed CeOx electron extraction layer. Using a CeOx EEL increased the light reflection from the Ag electrode and facilitated the charge extraction because of a better energy alignment with the perovskite. Compared to an organic PCBM EEL, dense CeOx not only protects the perovskite against water, but also acts as a diffusion barrier to prevent the corrosion of the metal electrode. Solution-processed CeOx is a promising material for p–i–n structured perovskite solar cells or relevant tandem solar cells.
