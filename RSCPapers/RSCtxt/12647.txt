    , Accepted 13th December 2016First published on 13th December 2016AbstractInterfacial engineering is critical for highly efficient charge carrier transport in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we developed a new method, called successive surface engineering, that affords PSCs with enhanced efficiency and dramatically suppressed current–voltage hysteresis. Upon modifying the TiO2 compact layer, which is commonly used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in regular-structure (n–i–p) planar heterojunction (PHJ) PSCs, by successively incorporating [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and an ethanolamine (ETA)-functionalized fullerene (C60-ETA) synthesized facilely via a one-pot nucleophilic addition reaction, the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the CH3NH3PbI3-based PHJ-PSC devices increased from 13.00% to 16.31%; the best PCE attained was 18.49%, which, to our knowledge, represents the highest PCE reported to date for regular-structure PHJ-PSCs devices based on fullerene-modified TiO2 interlayers. In contrast, single surface engineering of the TiO2 layer with a PC61BM or C60-ETA layer alone results in only negligible changes in PCE, revealing the synergistic effect of these two fullerene derivatives: the PC61BM layer can passivate the traps on the TiO2 surface, while the subsequent C60-ETA layer not only improves the wettability of the perovskite film on the ETL but also facilitates electron transport across the interface between the perovskite and the TiO2 ETL. The structural and morphological characterizations show that following dual surface modification of the TiO2 layer with PC61BM and C60-ETA, both the surface coverage and crystallinity of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film are improved. Steady-state photoluminescence decay and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic studies manifest that the dual surface modification substantially improves the charge extraction efficiency and suppresses charge recombination. As a consequence, this dual surface modification leads to an obvious increase of the short-circuit current density (Jsc), which contributes primarily to the PCE enhancement. Additionally, because PC61BM may induce passivation of the traps on the TiO2 surface and in the perovskite layer, remarkably, the hysteresis of the current–voltage response is dramatically suppressed following the dual surface modification.
Introduction
Organolead halide perovskite materials possess excellent photovoltaic properties, such as large optical absorption coefficients, direct band gaps that are tunable in the visible range, high carrier mobilities, small exciton binding energies, and long carrier diffusion lengths.1–4 Due to the pioneering research in the application of organolead halide perovskite as a sensitizer in conventional dye-sensitized solar cells by Miyasaka and coworkers in 2009, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn intense interest; vigorous efforts have been dedicated to fundamental studies of their working mechanisms of these devices as well as their optimization.1–10 To date, the record efficiency of these PSCs has exceeded 22%.11 In addition to their high attainable PCEs, a notable advantage of PSCs is that they can be fabricated by low-cost solution processing techniques, avoiding the use of the highly complex vacuum deposition apparatus that is usually applied in the fabrication of second-generation thin film solar cells.1–10
As one of the most efficient configurations of PSCs, planar heterojunctions (PHJs), developed by Snaith et al. in 2013, enable efficient charge separation and thus are currently popular; in a PHJ, a light-absorbing perovskite material such as CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) is sandwiched by interfacial layers containing electron and hole transport materials, comprising regular (n–i–p) or inverted (p–i–n) structures.12 Because the interfacial layers play important roles in adjusting the energy levels and electrical conductivity, passivating the traps in perovskite and even improving its long-term stability, interface engineering has been revealed to be determinative for efficient charge transport in PHJ-PSCs.13–39 Specifically for regular-structure (n–i–p) PHJ-PSCs, TiO2 has been commonly used as an electron transport layer (ETL); it is deposited on the bottom transparent electrode and the perovskite layer is attached on top of it, showing the advantages of low cost, ease of fabrication and phase stability.25,40 However, TiO2 ETLs have inherent drawbacks. For example, the electrical conductivity of a TiO2 compact layer (∼10−11 S cm−1) is rather low,24 leading to inefficient electron extraction; this results in charge accumulation and imbalance of the charge transport in the device because the hole diffusion length is much longer than that of the electrons in CH3NH3PbI3 film.24,41,42 In addition, when exposed to UV light, TiO2 generates abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface, resulting in high density of the electronic trap states; this, along with the low electron mobility of TiO2, causes undesirable charge accumulation and recombination.25,37–40,43,44 To overcome these shortcomings, various surface modification strategies have been developed; among these, fullerene derivatives, which are strong electron acceptors, have been recently applied for the surface engineering of TiO2 ETLs.21–27,36–38 For example, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), which is the most popular acceptor in polymer solar cells as well as the most commonly used ETL in inverted-structure (p–i–n) perovskite solar cells,12 was applied by Gong et al. in regular-structure CH3NH3PbI3 PHJ-PSC devices as an interfacial layer to modify TiO2, resulting in enhanced PCE (from 7.1% to 13.2%) due to the much higher electrical conductivity of PC61BM (∼10−9 S cm−1)20 relative to TiO2.24 Snaith et al. used self-assembled fullerene monolayers (C60-SAM) to modify TiO2 compact layers, achieving a PCE of 17.3% due to the passivation effects of the trap states formed at the TiO2/perovskite interface.22,26 A triblock fullerene derivative was applied recently as a multifunctional cathode modification layer on TiO2 by Yang et al.; this layer effectively passivated the TiO2 surface, contributing to improvements in both the photovoltaic performance and the device stability.25 Notably, these strategies are mostly based on a sole surface engineering method, i.e., only a single fullerene derivative interlayer with limited functions is deposited onto the TiO2 ETL; also, the wettability of the perovskite film atop the fullerene derivative interlayer becomes a major concern if a hydrophobic fullerene derivative such as PC61BM is used.24,25,27,38
Herein, we report a new method, called successive surface engineering, for modification of the TiO2 ETL. Two different fullerene derivatives with distinct hydrophilicities, including hydrophobic PC61BM and a hydrophilic ethanolamine (ETA)-functionalized fullerene (C60-ETA) synthesized facilely via a one-pot nucleophilic addition reaction, were deposited successively onto a TiO2 compact layer; this led not only to obvious efficiency enhancement but also to dramatically suppressed current–voltage hysteresis for regular-structure CH3NH3PbI3 PHJ-PSC devices. The role of each fullerene layer was elucidated on the basis of comparative structural, morphological and interfacial characterizations, revealing that the PC61BM layer is capable of passivating traps on the TiO2 surface and reducing charge recombination, while the follow-up C60-ETA layer improves the wettability of the PbI2 precursor solution on the surface of the PC61BM layer, contributing to the formation of a uniform perovskite film with improved crystallinity.
Results and discussion
It is well known that the film quality of the perovskite light-absorber layer is essential for high-performance PHJ-PSCs because it determines the charge carrier generation.45–47 In this study, we preferentially adopted a two-step method to fabricate CH3NH3PbI3 film, in which the PbI2 precursor layer was first spin-coated onto a pristine or modified TiO2 ETL, followed by immersion in a CH3NH3I solution in isopropanol.7,9,32,48,49 Surface modification of the TiO2 layer was first carried out by spin-coating a PC61BM solution in chlorobenzene with a fixed concentration of 20 mg mL−1 at 2000 rpm, affording a PC61BM interlayer with a thickness of ca. 50 nm, which is comparable to those reported in the literature prepared under similar conditions.24 In order to realize dual modification of the TiO2 layer, C60-ETA, which was synthesized facilely via a one-pot nucleophilic addition reaction as reported previously and has an estimated molecular formula of C60(NHC2H4OH)8(H)8,50 was dissolved in methanol with a fixed concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 (higher concentrations were also tested but yielded precipitation) and spin-coated onto the TiO2/PC61BM bilayer at 2500 rpm. For this successive surface engineering method, the difference in hydrophilicity between hydrophobic PC61BM and hydrophilic C60-ETA is critical because it allows the utilization of two solvents with different polarities to spin-coat the two fullerene interlayers successively; otherwise, if a similar solvent was used, spin-coating the second fullerene interlayer would cause damage to the first PC61BM layer.
When the two-step method is used to fabricate CH3NH3PbI3 film, the PbI2 precursor layer is typically first prepared by spin-coating PbI2 solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) onto the substrate.7,9,32,48,49 It is intriguing to determine whether spin-coating of the PbI2/DMSO solution would affect the PC61BM or C60-ETA interlayer underneath. We investigated the influence of DMSO washing on the PC61BM or C60-ETA interlayer by UV-vis absorption and XPS spectroscopies; we confirmed that the PC61BM or C60-ETA layer remains, although spin-coating the PbI2/DMSO solution on top resulted in partial washing out (see ESI-Fig. S1 and S2†). This ensures the individual effects of the layers are retained in the PSC device, as discussed below. The surface morphologies of the PbI2 precursor layer and the corresponding CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared on different substrates were first characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and are compared in Fig. 1A and B. Clearly, the PbI2 layer shows distinct morphologies on different substrates. The PbI2 film formed atop the TiO2 or TiO2/C60-ETA substrate is incontinuous, with random cracks (Fig. 1a and b), whereas that on the TiO2/PC61BM substrate is needle-shaped with obvious pinholes (Fig. 1c) resulting from the poor wettability of the PbI2/DMSO solution on the hydrophobic PC61BM surface, as discussed below. However, after dual modification of the TiO2 layer with PC61BM and C60-ETA successively, the PbI2 film becomes more uniform, with nearly no pinholes (Fig. 1d). Interestingly, the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film inherits this great difference in the morphology of the PbI2 precursor layer. While the CH3NH3PbI3 film exhibits relatively low coverage, with a considerable number of pinholes, on the TiO2 or TiO2/C60-ETA substrate (Fig. 1e and f),21,24,27,48,49 even more pinholes are found for the CH3NH3PbI3 film on the TiO2/PC61BM substrate, as reflected by its larger void ratio (Fig. 1g, see also ESI-Fig. S3 and Table S1†). The inferior quality of the CH3NH3PbI3 film prepared on the TiO2 layer modified with PC61BM alone is due to the fact that the hydrophobic nature of PC61BM is unfavorable for spreading the PbI2 precursor film prepared from the polar solvent DMSO, leading to the formation of incontinuous perovskite film. The uniformity is largely improved for the CH3NH3PbI3 film fabricated on the TiO2/PC61BM/C60-ETA substrate (Fig. 1h) in terms of the lower number of pinholes, as evidenced by its smallest void ratio (see ESI-Fig. S3 and Table S1†).

The uniformity and roughness of CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared on different substrates were then characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode (Fig. 1C). Clearly, the CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared on different substrates exhibit similar morphologies comprising many nanoparticles. While incorporation of a single PC61BM or C60-ETA layer leads to little change in the morphology of the CH3NH3PbI3 film (Fig. 1i–k), CH3NH3PbI3 film prepared on the PC61BM/C60-ETA bilayer appears more uniform, with a denser grain arrangement (Fig. 1l). A plausible explanation for the morphology improvement upon incorporation of C60-ETA onto the PC61BM layer is that the C60-ETA molecules first aggregate to form nanoparticles (see ESI-Fig. S4d and h†) which act as nucleation centers for CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystals. According to the theory of nucleation and crystal growth, these randomly distributed C60-ETA nanoparticles enable the heterogeneous nucleation of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, which is more kinetically feasible than the homogeneous nucleation process, leading to a denser, more uniform and continuous CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3, TiO2/C60-ETA/CH3NH3PbI3, TiO2/PC61BM/CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2/PC61BM/C60-ETA/CH3NH3PbI3 films are 9.51, 7.40, 7.57 and 6.93 nm, respectively; this suggests that dual modification of TiO2 with PC61BM and C60-ETA results in the smoothest CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film, whereas modifying TiO2 with PC61BM or C60-ETA alone also improves the roughness of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film.
To determine the reason for the morphological changes arising from different surface modifications, we then examined the wettabilities of the different substrates and the PbI2 layer as the precursor for CH3NH3PbI3 film fabricated by a two-step method. A rational assumption is that good wettability between the PbI2 solution and the substrate will drive the growth of uniform CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film.24Fig. 2 presents images of droplets of PbI2 solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on top of the different substrates. The contact angle of a PbI2 droplet on the FTO/TiO2 substrate is 23°; this increases to 37° upon PC61BM modification. Notably, upon further incorporation of a C60-ETA layer, the contact angle decreases obviously to about 3°, indicating that the wettability of PbI2/DMSO solution on the C60-ETA layer is dramatically improved. These phenomena are understandable considering that PC61BM is hydrophobic, whereas C60-ETA becomes hydrophilic due to the multi-addition of ETA groups; this naturally results in improved wettability with the polar DMSO solvent. As a result, this improved wettability induced by subsequent C60-ETA incorporation affords uniform distribution of PbI2 on the substrate, facilitating the formation of uniform CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film with fewer pinholes. However, the poor wettability of PbI2/DMSO solution on the PC61BM modified surface gives rise to inhomogeneous PbI2 film, forming an incontinuous perovskite layer with large pinholes after the reaction with CH3NH3I. Based on the distinct wettability of the PbI2/DMSO solution on the PC61BM and C60-ETA layers, it is inappropriate to reverse the incorporation order of PC61BM and C60-ETA (i.e., TiO2/C60-ETA/PC61BM); otherwise, the wettability problem of PbI2/DMSO solution on the PC61BM surface would occur. It is thus intriguing to investigate whether these changes in the morphology and wettability of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film would affect the crystallinity of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film. The XRD patterns of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films fabricated on different substrates (FTO/TiO2, FTO/TiO2/C60-ETA, FTO/TiO2/PC61BM, and FTO/TiO2/PC61BM/C60-ETA) are compared in Fig. 3. Regardless of the nature of the substrate, the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films show almost identical diffraction patterns without impurity phases. A set of diffraction peaks at 14.1°, 28.5°, and 31.8°, which are indexed as the (110), (220) and (310) crystal planes of the tetragonal phase of CH3NH3PbI3,48,49,51,52 are observed for all the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films, suggesting their good crystallinities. Although no new diffraction peaks can be observed after PC61BM/C60-ETA dual modification, the intensities of the three intense diffraction peaks of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite increase compared to those observed after pristine TiO2 or TiO2/PC61BM substrate modification (see curves a, c and d), suggesting that the crystallinity of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film is improved following PC61BM/C60-ETA dual modification. This crystallinity enhancement may improve the optical absorption of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film,21 as confirmed experimentally by UV-vis absorption spectroscopic characterizations (see ESI-Fig. S5b†).

The improvements in the morphology, wettability and crystallinity of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film after dual modification of the TiO2 layer with PC61BM and C60-ETA stimulated us to investigate whether these improvements contribute directly to the performance of PSC devices. Based on different ETLs, we fabricated PHJ-PSC devices in a glove box with the structure of FTO/ETL/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au; 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) was used as the hole transport material (HTM) (see Fig. 4a). For the convenience of discussion, the control device based on a pristine TiO2 ETL and those with C60-ETA, PC61BM, PC61BM/C60-ETA interlayers are denoted as devices A, B, C and D, respectively. The energy level alignments of the different layers are shown in Fig. 4b; the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of C60-ETA (−3.72 and −5.60 eV, respectively) were estimated by a cyclic voltammetric study in combination with diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (see ESI-Fig. S6†). The cross-sectional SEM images of devices A and D are shown in Fig. 4c and d. Clearly, the CH3NH3PbI3 layer with a thickness of ca. 250 nm is very compact and dense and is covered uniformly by a compact spiro-OMeTAD HTM layer with a thickness of ca. 200 nm. The thicknesses of the TiO2 and PC61BM layers are both estimated to be ca. 50 nm. It should be noted that the C60-ETA layer is too thin to be seen in the SEM image; thus, its thickness was estimated to be around 6.3 nm using a surface profilometer (see ESI-Fig. S7†).

(c and d) Cross-sectional SEM images of devices A and D. 
The photovoltaic performances of devices A–D based on different ETLs were measured under one-sun illumination, and the current density–voltage (J–V) curves are plotted in Fig. 5a. The measured photovoltaic parameters (open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), PCE, series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh)) are tabulated in Table 1. We fabricated more than 50 independent devices with regard to each type of device, and the statistical results are summarized in ESI-Fig. S8.† The control device based on the pristine TiO2 ETL (device A) shows a Voc of 1.07 V, a Jsc of 18.43 mA cm−2, a FF of 67.31%, and a PCE of 13.00%, which is comparable to the reported values of regular-structure PHJ-PSC devices fabricated under similar conditions.21,45,48,49 Upon modification with only C60-ETA (device B) or PC61BM (device C), the PCE shows negligible changes of 13.00% and 13.33% on average, respectively. Interestingly, after dual modification of TiO2 ETL with PC61BM and C60-ETA successively (device D), the average PCE increases dramatically to 16.31%, calculated from a Voc of 1.05 V, a Jsc of 22.90 mA cm−2, and a FF of 66.46%; the best PCE attained is 18.49%, which is 19.1% greater than that of the control device A. Notably, to our knowledge, our best PCE of 18.49% represents the highest PCE reported so far for regular-structure PHJ-PSCs devices based on fullerene-modified TiO2 interlayers.20–30,36–38

According to a detailed comparison of each photovoltaic parameter, it is found that the PCE enhancement of device D based on a TiO2/PC61BM/C60-ETA ETL relative to that based on a pristine TiO2 ETL predominantly originates from the increase of Jsc (from 18.43 to 22.90 mA cm−2, ∼24.3% enhancement), whereas Voc and FF exhibit negligible decreases (<2.0%). In the cases of devices B and C, with modification of TiO2 by C60-ETA or PC61BM alone, although Jsc obviously increases, the increase ratio is much lower than that in the case of TiO2/PC61BM/C60-ETA ETL, and Voc and FF exhibit larger decreases (see Table 1); thus, the increase of Jsc is compromised, and only a negligible PCE change is obtained relative to that of the control device A. The tendencies of change of each photovoltaic parameter were further confirmed by a statistical study based on 50 independent devices fabricated independently for each type of device with different ETLs (see ESI-Fig. S8† for the box plots of the photovoltaic parameters). We further measured the stabilized power output under working conditions (at the maximum power point) and, consequently, the stabilized PCE (see ESI-Fig. S10†); this confirmed that the PCE can be stabilized at ∼17.0% over the 140 s measurement period for device D.
The increase of Jsc upon dual modification of the TiO2 ETL with PC61BM and C60-ETA was confirmed by external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. Fig. 5b compares the EQE curves of devices A–D based on different ETLs, and the integrated photocurrent density (calculated Jsc) is listed in Table 1. The Jsc is consistent with the value calculated from EQE (see Table 1 and Fig. 5b). All curves exhibit a broad band with EQE > 70% in the region of 400 to 630 nm. Apparently, the overall EQE response of device D, especially in the region of 550 to 780 nm, is larger than that of the control device (device A), leading to an obvious increase of the integrated photocurrent density (see Table 1). This is consistent with the increase of Jsc obtained in the J–V measurements.
To rationalize the charge transfer properties with regard to different surface engineering techniques, we carried out steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements under an excitation wavelength of 460 nm. Fig. 6 compares the PL spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 films fabricated on different substrates, revealing that the PL peak of CH3NH3PbI3 at around 767 nm (curve a), which is assigned to the emission of CH3NH3PbI3,54 is dramatically quenched for the TiO2/PC61BM/CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2/PC61BM/C60-ETA/CH3NH3PbI3 films; this suggests a decrease in the trap density on the TiO2 surface.37,38,43,44 Additionally, we found that the PL peak of CH3NH3PbI3 fabricated on the PC61BM or PC61BM/C60-ETA substrate exhibited a blue-shift from 767 nm to around 761 nm (curves c and d), whereas the peak did not shift for the C60-ETA substrate (curve b). Similar phenomena have been reported in the literature; the blue-shift of the PL peak is attributed to passivation of the trap states of CH3NH3PbI3.39,55,56 Hence, the dramatic PL quenching of CH3NH3PbI3 film upon PC61BM or PC61BM/C60-ETA modification and the blue-shift of the PL peak of CH3NH3PbI3 suggest that PC61BM may induce passivation of traps both on the TiO2 surface and in the perovskite layer.57 Notably, the highest quenching ratio (∼59%) is observed for the TiO2/PC61BM/C60-ETA/CH3NH3PbI3 film (curve d), suggesting that the most efficient electron transfer occurs from the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer to the TiO2 ETL. This is understandable because the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film fabricated on the TiO2/PC61BM/C60-ETA substrate is smoother and more uniform than those fabricated on other substrates, as discussed above, on the basis of SEM and AFM characterizations (see Fig. 1). It has been reported that electron accumulation usually occurs at the PC61BM/perovskite interface due to largely delocalized surface states and orbital coupling.53 Upon subsequent surface modification of TiO2/PC61BM by C60-ETA, the strong electron-accepting ability of C60-ETA with high electron mobility (surpassing ZnO50) may facilitate electron injection from the perovskite layer to PC61BM, leading to an enhanced quenching ratio. Furthermore, the facilitated electron extraction would help to balance the charge transport in the entire device because the diffusion length of the holes is much longer than that of the electrons;24,41,42 hence, electron accumulation is avoided in the interface between the perovskite layer and ETL, resulting in improved device performance. In this sense, the much lower quenching ratio for the TiO2/C60-ETA/CH3NH3PbI3 film than for the PC61BM-incorporated films suggests that the effect of C60-ETA itself in passivating the traps on the TiO2 surface is inferior to that of PC61BM. This is very likely because the C60-ETA layer is too thin to form a continuous film; instead, dispersed nanoparticles are observed in the AFM image (see ESI-Fig. S4d†), and thus the coverage of the C60-ETA layer on TiO2 is low and some areas may be exposed directly to the perovskite layer, limiting electron transfer from the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer to the TiO2 ETL.
 Fig. 6  Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films fabricated on different substrates of FTO/TiO2 (a), FTO/TiO2/C60-ETA (b), FTO/TiO2/PC61BM (c) and FTO/TiO2/PC61BM/C60-ETA (d). 
Due to the facilitated electron extraction across the interface between perovskite and the TiO2 ETL due to the passivation of traps on the TiO2 surface, the hysteresis of the J–V curves can be remarkably reduced (Fig. 5c and d). Similar to phenomena reported in the literature, the control device based on the pristine TiO2 ETL (device A) shows a severe hysteresis of 29.4% between the forward and reverse scans. Upon dual modification of the TiO2 layer by PC61BM and C60-ETA, device D exhibits a significantly reduced hysteresis, with only a 6.8% drop from reverse to forward scan (see ESI-Table S2†). Remarkably, there are almost no differences in Voc and Jsc and a slight drop of ∼4% in FF. This phenomenon is also found for device C, based on modification of the TiO2 layer with PC61BM alone, which shows a comparably small hysteresis (not shown); this suggests that the significant suppression of the hysteresis is primarily due to PC61BM while the contribution of C60-ETA is negligible, as confirmed by the comparable hysteresis of device B to that of device A. It has been recognized that the hysteresis between the reverse and forward scan is mainly due to the enormous traps on TiO2 surface and in perovskite layer as well as ion migration.26,54,58–61 Thus, it is reasonable to identify PC61BM-induced passivation of traps on the TiO2 surface and in the perovskite layer as the major factor responsible for the hysteresis-suppressed current–voltage behavior upon dual modification of the TiO2 layer with PC61BM and C60-ETA.
In order to further unravel the interfacial charge transport properties of devices based on different ETLs, we carried out electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in the dark under a reverse potential of 1.0 V (near the open circuit potential). The Nyquist plots of devices A–D are illustrated in Fig. 7, which also includes the corresponding fitted curves based on a relatively simple equivalent circuit model, shown in the inset.49,62,63 Based on the equivalent circuit model, the data in the Nyquist plot is separated into two R-CPE arcs, consisting of a resistor Rs (series resistance, which is defined as the starting point at the real part of the Nyquist plot) connected with two parallel R-CPE elements. The Rco (contact resistance) is characterized by the high-frequency feature, which is associated with the ETL/perovskite interface. The recombination resistance (Rrec, which is sensitively dependent on the recombination properties) and the non-ideal chemical capacitances (CPE1, CPE2) of the system are determined by the lower frequency element.49,62–64 According to the fitted parameters summarized in ESI-Table S3,† device C, based on PC61BM modification alone, has a much larger recombination resistance (17530 Ω cm2) than control device A, which is based on a single TiO2 ETL (9784 Ω cm2); this indicates that the charge recombination is suppressed. On the other hand, the Rs and Rco values exhibit contrary tendencies: device A has a much larger Rco value (3289 Ω cm2) than devices B and D, which are based on single C60-ETA or dual PC61BM/C60-ETA modifications (2343 and 303 Ω cm2, respectively); this suggests that C60-ETA modification facilitates electron transport at the ETL/perovskite interface. Notably, device D, based on dual modification with PC61BM and C60-ETA, exhibits the smallest Rs, Rco and largest Rrec values. This suggests that this device has the most efficient electron transport along with the largest extent of suppressed charge recombination, both of which contribute to its highest Jsc among the four devices. These results are consistent with the analyses based on the crystallinities and PL properties of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films, as discussed above.

Finally, on the basis of the above analyses, the mechanism responsible for the increase of Jsc and, consequently, the dramatic PCE enhancement upon dual modification of the TiO2 layer with PC61BM and C60-ETA can be proposed. For the devices based on modification of the TiO2 ETL with C60-ETA or PC61BM alone, the corresponding CH3NH3PbI3 film exhibits the same or more and larger pinholes than the control device with pristine TiO2 ETL. This suggests poorer contact at the interface of the TiO2 ETL/CH3NH3PbI3, leading to deteriorated FF. Nevertheless, incorporation of the PC61BM layer may passivate the traps on the TiO2 surface and in the perovskite layer, contributing to the increase of Jsc. Thus, a tradeoff between Jsc and FF occurs, leading to only negligible PCE enhancement. Upon modification of TiO2 with C60-ETA alone, although C60-ETA modification facilitates electron transport at the ETL/perovskite interface and contributes to the increase of Jsc, the very thin C60-ETA layer leads to the formation of dispersed nanoparticles instead of a continuous film; as a result, the increase of Jsc is compromised by the more obvious decrease of FF, and a negligible PCE change is observed as well. However, the dual modification of TiO2 by PC61BM and C60-ETA results in significant differences. First, the hydrophilic nature of C60-ETA confers improved wettability with PbI2/DMSO solution, resulting in dramatic improvements in the roughness and uniformity of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film. Second, the enhanced crystallinity of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film may improve its optical absorption. Third, the strong electron-accepting ability of C60-ETA may facilitate electron injection from the perovskite layer to PC61BM, leading to improvement in the electron extraction across the interface between perovskite and TiO2 ETL and, consequently, to more balanced charge transport. Consequently, this synergistic effect of PC61BM and C60-ETA results in high efficiency of the PSC device. However, because the LUMO level of C60-ETA lies slightly higher than the conduction band of CH3NH3PbI3 (see Fig. 4b), this small energy level mismatch may be unfavorable for electron injection from the perovskite layer to PC61BM in terms of energetic offset; this may compromise the facilitated electron transport due to the strong electron-accepting ability of the ultrathin C60-ETA layer, resulting in a negligible decrease of Voc (<2.0%).
The synergistic effect of PC61BM and C60-ETA on the efficiency enhancement of regular-structure (n–i–p) PHJ-PSCs is further testified by an inverted-structure (p–i–n) PHJ-PSC device with a typical configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x/PC61BM/Ag.12,17,62 According to our preliminary results, upon subsequent modification of the PC61BM ETL with C60-ETA, a PCE enhancement from 9.05% to 11.70% is obtained for a ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x/PC61BM/C60-ETA/Ag device, mainly due to the increase of Jsc (by ∼12.1%). The dramatic decrease of the series resistance (Rs) (from 7.6 to 3.9 Ω cm2) along with the increase of the shunt resistance (Rsh) suggests that the improvement in electron transport is induced by C60-ETA (see ESI-Fig. S11 and Table S4†). Although a mechanistic understanding of the effect of C60-ETA on the efficiency enhancement of the inverted-structure PHJ-PSC device remains to be acquired, this preliminary study confirms the electron transport ability of C60-ETA.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a successive surface engineering method via dual surface modification of the commonly used TiO2 compact layer with PC61BM and C60-ETA, achieving dramatic efficiency enhancement with hysteresis-suppressed current–voltage response. After dual modification of TiO2 with PC61BM and C60-ETA, a maximum PCE of 18.49% is achieved, which is dramatically higher than that of a control device based on pristine TiO2 ETL; this represents the highest PCE reported to date for regular-structure PHJ-PSCs devices based on fullerene-modified TiO2 interlayers. Contrastingly, upon modification with PC61BM or C60-ETA alone, only a negligible change in the average PCE relative to that of the control device was observed. This reveals the advantage of our successive surface engineering method, in which the PC61BM layer can passivate the traps on the TiO2 surface and in the perovskite layer; specifically, the hydrophilic C60-ETA layer not only improves the wettability of the perovskite film on the ETL but also facilitates electron transport across the interface between perovskite and the TiO2 ETL. With proof-of-concept success in the performance enhancement of perovskite solar cells in terms of both the PCE and the hysteresis of the current–voltage response, this study not only provides new insight into interface engineering but also provides a practical approach to the fabrication of high-performance perovskite solar cells.
Experimental
Materials
FTO-coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 13 ± 1.5 Ω sq−1 were purchased from NSG Group, Japan. CH3NH3I was synthesized according to a procedure reported previously.7,48,49 Titanium(IV) isopropoxide, PbI2, lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP), hydriodic acid, methylamine solution, 1-hexanethiol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), chlorobenzene, isopropanol, and acetonitrile were purchased from Alfa Aesar. PC61BM and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) were purchased from Nichem Fine Technology Co., Ltd. and 1 M company, respectively. C60-ETA was synthesized via a facile one-pot nucleophilic addition reaction by heating a mixture of ethanolamine (ETA) and C60 at 80 °C for 1 hour, as reported previously.50 All chemicals were used as received with no further purification.
Device fabrication
For the control CH3NH3PbI3 PHJ-PSC device (device A), our detailed fabrication procedure has been reported previously.48,49 Briefly, the FTO-coated glass substrate was ultrasonicated in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol for 15 min after being etched with zinc powder and after being etched with 2 M HCl (diluted in water); the substrate was subsequently dried at 60 °C. A TiO2 compact layer was spin-coated onto FTO with a mixture solution of 350 μL of titanium isopropoxide, 5 mL of ethanol, and 65 μL of HCl (2 M) at 2000 rpm for 40 s and dried at 100 °C for 20 minutes, followed by annealing at 550 °C for 50 min. For the devices with a PC61BM interlayer, a PC61BM film was deposited onto TiO2 compact layer by spin-coating a PC61BM solution in chlorobenzene (20 mg mL−1) at 2000 rpm for 40 s. For the preparation of the C60-ETA interlayer, a solution of C60-ETA in methanol (0.5 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the underlying layer (TiO2 compact layer or TiO2/PC61BM) at 3000 rpm, 40 s. The CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer was fabricated by a two-step method reported previously.7,9,32,48,49 A PbI2 solution (dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide with a concentration of 460 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on top of the compact TiO2 layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The coated substrate was immersed in a solution of CH3NH3I in isopropanol (10 mg mL−1) for 10 min and then rinsed with isopropanol and dried by spinning at 3000 rpm. The as-prepared substrate was heated at 100 °C for 10 min, then cooled to room temperature. To prepare the spiro-OMeTAD layer, 73.2 mg spiro-OMeTAD was first dissolved in 1 mL chlorobenzene; then, 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 18.8 μL of Li-TFSI solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) were added. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated onto the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s to form a hole transport layer. Finally, the device was transferred into a vacuum chamber (∼10−6 torr), and an Au electrode (ca. 100 nm thick) was thermally deposited through a shadow mask to define the effective active area of the device (0.10 cm2). All device fabrication procedures were carried out in a N2-purged glovebox (<0.1 ppm of O2 and H2O).
Measurements and characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characterizations were conducted using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under simulated AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) with a standard xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A, USA); the solar simulator illumination intensity was calibrated with a monocrystalline silicon reference cell (Oriel P/N 91150 V, with KG-5 visible color filter) calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The measurements were carried out with a mask (well-defined area size of 0.10 cm2) to ensure accurate measurement in ambient surroundings. Around 50 devices were fabricated and measured independently under each experimental condition to confirm the reproducibility of the results and to obtain the statistical histograms of the photovoltaic parameters. The EQE measurements were carried out on an ORIEL Intelligent Quantum Efficiency (IQE) 200TM Measurement system equipped with a tunable light source.
The thickness of the film was obtained by a KLA-Tencor P6 surface profilometer. XPS measurements were conducted on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 instrument with a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source. AFM measurements were performed on a XE-7 scanning probe microscope in non-contact mode (Park systems, Korea). SEM images were obtained with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FEI Quanta 200). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were acquired using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 460 nm. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer at a scan rate of 8° min−1 with Cu-Kα radiation (0.154 nm). Impedance spectroscopic measurements (EIS) were performed using an electrochemical workstation (Autolab 320, Metrohm, Switzerland) with a frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 MHz under 1.0 V in the dark. AC 20 mV perturbation was applied with a frequency from 1 MHz to 1 Hz. The obtained impedance spectra were fitted with Z-View software (v2.8b, Scribner Associates, USA). Contact angles were measured using a CAM instrument (Data-Physics, Germany).

 	Fig. 1  Surface topographic SEM of PbI2 film (A) and CH3NH3PbI3 film (B) and the corresponding AFM height (C) images of CH3NH3PbI3 film on FTO/TiO2 (a, e and i), FTO/TiO2/C60-ETA (b, f and j), FTO/TiO2/PC61BM (c, g and k) and FTO/TiO2/PC61BM/C60-ETA (d, h and l).	 

 	Fig. 2  Contact angles of PbI2/DMSO solution (1 mol L−1) on pristine TiO2 (a), TiO2/PC61BM (b) and TiO2/PC61BM/C60-ETA (c) surfaces.	 

 	Fig. 3  X-ray diffraction patterns of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layers fabricated on FTO/TiO2 (a), FTO/TiO2/C60-ETA (b), FTO/TiO2/PC61BM (c) and FTO/TiO2/PC61BM/C60-ETA (d) substrates. The filled triangles and asterisks mark the characteristic diffraction peaks of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and FTO/TiO2 substrate, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Schematic of the structure of the PHJ-PSC device based on the TiO2/PC61BM/C60-ETA ETL (device D). (b) Energy level diagram for the corresponding materials used in our PHJ-PSC devices. The energy levels of the LUMO and HOMO of C60-ETA were estimated by a cyclic voltammetric study in combination with diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; the work functions of FTO, TiO2, spiro-OMeTAD and Au, the conduction/valence bands of CH3NH3PbI3, and the LUMO/HOMO levels of PC61BM were obtained from ref. 20 and 45. (c and d) Cross-sectional SEM images of devices A and D.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) J–V curves of devices A–D measured under illumination of an AM 1.5 solar simulator (100 mW cm−2) in air. The scanning direction is from open-circuit voltage to short circuit (reverse). (b) EQE spectra of devices A–D measured in air. (c and d) J–V curves of devices A and D, respectively, in different scan directions.
