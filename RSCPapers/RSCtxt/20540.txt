    , Accepted 11th December 2016First published on 12th December 2016AbstractWe report a simple and effective interface engineering method for achieving highly efficient planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing SnO2 electron selective layers (ESLs). Herein, a 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) self-assembled monolayer (SAM) was used to modify the SnO2 ESL/perovskite layer interface. This APTES SAM demonstrates multiple functions: (1) it can increase the surface energy and enhance the affinity of the SnO2 ESL, which induce the formation of high quality perovskite films with a better morphology and enhanced crystallinity. (2) Its terminal functional groups form dipoles on the SnO2 surface, leading to a decreased work function of SnO2 and enlarged built-in potential of SnO2/perovskite heterojunctions. (3) The terminal groups can passivate the trap states at the perovskite surface via hydrogen bonding. (4) The thin insulating layer at the interface can hinder electron back transfer and reduce the recombination process at the interface effectively. With these desirable properties, the best-performing cell employing a APTES SAM modified-SnO2 ESL achieved a PCE over 18% and a steady-state efficiency of 17.54%. Impressively, to the best of our knowledge, the obtained VOC of 1.16 V is the highest value reported for the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) system. Our results suggest that the ESL/perovskite interface engineering with a APTES SAM is a promising method for fabricating efficient and hysteresis-less PSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained significant attention due to their excellent photovoltaic properties, with a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.1% within a very short period of time.1–6 To fabricate efficient PSCs, morphology control of perovskite films, device structure optimization and development of effective fabrication techniques are crucial factors.7–15 In addition, interface engineering in PSCs is also important for improving device performance, and deserves more investigation.6,16–19
It is apparent that four main interfaces exist in PSCs, which are the electron selective layer (ESL)/perovskite absorber layer interface and perovskite absorber layer/hole selective layer (HSL) interface, as well as the front and back contact interfaces, which significantly influence charge extraction, collection and recombination.16 Among them, ESLs and HSLs with energy levels well-matched with those of perovskite absorbers are vital to ensure efficient charge transport from the perovskite layer to charge selective layers. Most high efficiency perovskite solar cells normally adopted a mesoscopic structure, which is not beneficial for device simplicity and process compatibility. In this regard, planar perovskite solar cells (with normal or inverted structures) have attracted much attention because of their simple fabrication process.20,21 However, the performance of these planar devices is very sensitive to the interfaces, especially the ESL/perovskite interface. Therefore, interface engineering is essential for achieving highly efficient planar PSCs.6,22,23 At the cathode side, electron extraction and transport are realized via the electron selective contact of ESLs, such as TiO2, ZnO.23–26 These n-type metal oxides have gained extensive attention due to their good opto-electrical properties. However, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 and thermal instability of ZnO may be harmful for device performance and stability.27,28 Recently, SnO2 has shown great potential as a promising ESL with advantages such as better cell stability, large bandgap, high transparency and high electron mobility.29,30 Although planar PSCs based on a SnO2 ESL have achieved a PCE over 18%, systematic investigations are missing for the related interface issue, such as energy level alignment, interfacial contact, etc.
Interface modification of TiO2 and ZnO ESLs has proven to be a good approach for improving device performance.23,31,32 As fullerene molecules could act as a good electron transporter (collector), they have been reported to modify the TiO2/perovskite and ZnO/perovskite interface. With this interfacial layer, the cell performance was enhanced and the photocurrent hysteresis behavior was significantly reduced.31,32 However, fullerene molecules are easily dissolved by solvents from perovskite solutions and homogeneous fullerene molecule films are not easily obtained.32 A self-assembled monolayer (SAM) is also an effective interfacial layer in organic solar cells (OPVs) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), which can tune the energy level, modulate the surface energy and enhance the affinities of the films or substrates.33–37 It has been reported that self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have many favorable effects on interface modification. For example, a SAM can affect the energy level by imparting a dipole moment at the interface.38 Besides, a SAM is known to passivate inorganic surface states by chemical bonding, and thus tune the surface electronic states. Additionally, a SAM can also influence the growth process of organic semiconductors, leading to different morphologies. Therefore, SAM treatment as a simple and effective interface engineering approach was carried out to optimize the SnO2 ESL/perovskite interface for highly efficient, hysteresis-suppressed planar PSCs.
In this work, a 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) SAM as an interfacial layer was used to modify the SnO2 ESL/perovskite layer interface, which could enhance the interfacial contact and improve the morphology and crystallinity of perovskite films. Additionally, a functionalized APTES SAM can induce the formation of dipoles to tailor the band energy alignment and increase the built-in potential, giving rise to an enhanced driving force for the separation of photogenerated carriers and accelerating charge extraction. Due to the multifunctional nature of a APTES SAM, such alkyl chains can also act as an electrically insulating barrier, retarding electron transfer back from electrodes to the perovskite layer and suppressing recombination processes. In addition, the terminal groups can passivate the trap states at the perovskite surface via hydrogen-bonding interactions (N–H⋯I), reducing charge accumulation and recombination induced by these trap states. To reduce the anomalous hysteresis behavior and stabilize the photovoltaic performance of planar perovskite solar cells, we further optimize and control the grain size of perovskite films. We deposited well crystalline perovskite films with large grain sizes by adding a small amount of Pb(SCN)2 in the precursor. As expected, both grain size enhancement and APTES SAM interface modification can be effective ways to mitigate the hysteresis phenomenon in planar perovskite solar cells. As a result, a high efficiency over 18% with negligible hysteresis for planar PSCs employing a APTES SAM-modified SnO2 ESL has been achieved. We believe that this simple and effective strategy is significant for developing highly efficient planar PSCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Lead iodide (PbI2) and methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) were purchased from TCI. 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-pmethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD, 99.9%), Li bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI), 4-tertbutylpyridine (TBP), (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES), Pb(SCN)2, SnCl2·2H2O and all solvents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
2.2. Device fabrication
The FTO substrates were cleaned sequentially in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and an ethanol ultrasonic bath for 20 min, respectively. SnO2 ESLs were prepared by a low-temperature solution process reported in our previous work.30 In short, 0.1 M precursor solutions of SnCl2·2H2O in ethanol were spin coated on the clean FTO substrates with a spin rate of 2000 rpm for 45 s to obtain dense and uniform SnO2 ESLs. And then, the SnO2 coated FTO substrates were annealed on a hotplate in air at 180 °C for 1 h. For the APTES SAM modified SnO2 ESLs, the as-prepared SnO2 compact films were immersed in a 5 mM solution of APTES in isopropanol for several hours to induce a APTES SAM on the surface of SnO2. After that, the substrates were rinsed in isopropanol and then dried under a flow of N2. The perovskite film was deposited via a solvent engineering method. The perovskite precursor solutions contained PbI2 (1.38 M) and MAI (1.38 M) in a mixed anhydrous solvent of DMF and DMSO (volume ratio: 4:1). The spin-coating procedure was performed as follows: first, the perovskite precursor solutions were spin-coated onto the SnO2 or APTES SAM-modified SnO2 films with a spin rate of 500 rpm for 3 s; second, with a spin rate of 4000 rpm for 30 s. During the earlier 10 s in the second step, 500 μL of ethyl ether was dropped onto the spinning substrates. And then the substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min on a hotplate. After the substrates cooled down to room temperature, the spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution was spin coated onto the perovskite layer with a spin rate of 3000 rpm for 30 s. The spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 17.5 μL of a stock solution of 520 mg mL−1 lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl) imide (Li-TFSI) in acetonitrile and 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in 1 mL chlorobenzene. Finally, 100-nm-thick Au was thermally evaporated as the back electrode.
2.3. Characterization
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were performed using an XPS/UPS system (Thermo Scientific, ESCLAB 250Xi, USA). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained using a VERTEX 70 from Bruker Company (Germany). Absorbance spectra were measured by using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (CARY5000, Varian). The morphology of the ESLs was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM SPM-9500J3, Shimadzu, Japan). The capacitance voltage measurements were carried out by using a CHI660D electrochemical workstation (Shanghai, China). The frequency was 1 kHz at bias potentials between 0 and 1.2 V. The crystallinity of perovskite films was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker AXS, D8 Advance) with Cu Kα radiation under operating conditions of 40 kV and 40 mA. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were taken on a QE-R 3011 system (Enli). The morphology of the devices and the perovskite films was observed by using a high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Nova Nano-SEM 450). TRPL spectra were measured by exciting samples using a supercontinuum fiber laser at a wavelength of 600 nm at a repetition rate of 20 kHz. J–V curves were measured at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1 by using a CHI660D electrochemical workstation (Shanghai, China). The light intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated by using a standard KG3 silicon solar cell provided by Enli.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural characterization of APTES SAM surface-modified SnO2 films
The structure of our regular planar perovskite solar cell using SnO2 ESLs is shown in Fig. 1a. A APTES SAM is employed as an interfacial layer to modify the surface of the SnO2 ESL. As shown in Fig. 1b, the organic silane was chemically bonded to the SnO2 layer surface via hydrogen-bonding between the organic hydrolyzed alkoxy groups and the hydroxyl groups present at the surface of SnO2.33 The terminal functional group plays a significant role in directing the dipole moment, which depends on the electron withdrawing and electron donating nature of the atoms across the molecular structure.35 Here, the attachment groups of the APTES SAM on the SnO2 surfaces with amine (–NH2) induce dipoles pointing away from SnO2 (Fig. 1b). To identify the formation of a APTES SAM on the SnO2 surface, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed to check the chemical bonding state of the SnO2 films before and after APTES SAM modification (Fig. S1†). In addition, the FTIR spectra of SnO2 films with and without APTES SAM modification were measured to specify the formation of the APTES SAM (Fig. S1c†). The absorption bands of –NH2, –CH2 and Si–O–Si indicated that the APTES SAM was successfully introduced onto the surface of SnO2 films.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of a perovskite solar cell based on the SAM modified SnO2 ESL. 
As shown in Fig. 1a and b, compared to the SnO2 film without APTES SAM modification, the APTES SAM-modified SnO2 film showed a pronounced N 1s peak (∼400 eV) and Si 2p peak (102.68 eV), indicating the successful formation of a APTES SAM on SnO2 substrates.
The atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of the SnO2 ESL surface revealed a smoother surface with a root-mean-square (rms) surface roughness of 4.71 nm (8.17 nm for SnO2 without APTES SAM modification) after APTES SAM modification (Fig. S2†). It is believed that the smooth surface can provide the SnO2 ESL better interfacial contact with the perovskite layer, leading to a decreased sheet resistance and an increased fill factor (FF). These results also demonstrate that a APTES SAM was successfully introduced onto the SnO2 surface.
3.2. Effect of APTES SAM modification on optical and electronic properties
It is known that the morphology and crystallization of perovskite films have significant impact on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells. Optimization of the deposition method of perovskite films, focusing on engineering the perovskite film nucleation and growth processes, is found to be an effective method to control the perovskite morphology.39,40 In addition, the surface energy of substrates and affinity between substrates and the perovskite layer have beneficial effects on the perovskite film morphology.41–43 The formation of large perovskite crystals can be realized by anchoring TiO2 and perovskite with COOH− and NH3+.44 Introducing the C3-SAM onto the ZnO surface can improve substrate miscibility with the perovskite, giving rise to an improved morphology of the crystalline perovskite film.22 Here, we find that morphology control of the perovskite film can be achieved via modifying the SnO2 ESL with APTES SAM treatment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to visualize the surfaces of perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 2. For solar cell fabrication, before perovskite film deposition, the substrates were normally treated with ultraviolet-ozone (UVO).45 Therefore, herein, the pristine SnO2 ESLs were treated with UVO before depositing perovskite films. As we can see from the evolution of surface images, substantial morphological improvements can be obtained with the APTES SAM modification in terms of surface uniformity and grain size of the perovskite films. The better wetting properties of both APTES SAM-treated and UVO-treated SnO2 can ensure the formation of pinhole-free perovskite films with good coverage. It is worth noting that the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) films deposited on APTES SAM-modified SnO2 ESLs are smoother and show larger perovskite grain sizes compared to those fabricated on pristine SnO2 substrates with UVO treatment. When the APTES SAM treatment time is 3 h, the MAPbI3 film exhibits a relatively uniform, smooth surface with favorable grain sizes. This interesting phenomenon may be attributed to the enhanced affinity between the perovskite layer and SAM-modified SnO2 ESL induced by hydrogen bonds formed by the amino group (APTES) with the halide anions of the perovskite. Besides, nucleation barrier, an important factor influencing the nucleation and growth processes of perovskite films, also needs to be considered. The surface energy of SnO2 can be adjusted by introducing the APTES SAM. As shown in Fig. S3,† the contact angle on SnO2 without APTES SAM modification was 71°. After APTES SAM modification, the SnO2 surface became more hydrophilic (contact angle was 39°), due to the enhanced affinity induced by the reported hydrogen-bonding.35 The contact angle measurement was also carried out for the UVO-treated FTO/SnO2 substrate and the resulting contact angle is 4.17°. As shown in Fig. 2a–d, a significant increase in perovskite grain size can be seen when the perovskite film is deposited on APTES SAM-treated substrates. The underlying reason may be ascribed to the smaller number of nuclei formed on APTES SAM-treated SnO2 surfaces because of the lowered surface energy.42

The structure of the perovskite film was found to be dependent on the substrates.46 X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were taken to evaluate the effect of APTES SAM modification on the final perovskite crystallinity, as shown in Fig. 3a. All the peaks in the XRD patterns could be indexed to the tetragonal crystal structure of MAPbI3, and the APTES SAM modification did not change the growth direction of the perovskite crystal on the SnO2 films. It is noteworthy that perovskite diffraction peaks became significantly enhanced when the perovskite films were deposited on the APTES SAM treated substrates, indicating the improved crystallinity of perovskite films.47 The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of perovskite films deposited on SnO2 ESLs with and without APTES SAM treatment are shown in Fig. 3b. The absorption of the MAPbI3 film deposited on APTES SAM-modified SnO2 was increased in the range of visible light, which was mainly attributed to the better morphology and crystallinity of perovskite films (the thicknesses of the perovskite films are almost the same).

The APTES SAM, with electron-donating groups, can alone function as an ESL in organic solar cells.33 Here, modifying the SnO2 surface with a APTES SAM can tune its relative electronic properties. We investigated the influence of APTES SAM modification on the work function (WF) of the SnO2 ESL. The WF of the SnO2 ESL before and after APTES SAM modification was determined using a Kelvin probe. Fig. S4† shows the WF of APTES SAM-treated SnO2 surfaces as a function of APTES SAM treatment time, showing an obvious decrease of the WF after APTES SAM treatment. The WF value of untreated SnO2 was determined to be 4.74 eV. After APTES SAM treatment, the WF value of SnO2 decreased to 4.56, 4.54, and 4.53 eV, which corresponds to a treatment time of 1 h, 3 h, and 15 h, respectively. This significant decrease in the WF can be attributed to the formation of favorable interface dipoles, ensuring better energy level matching and efficient electron transport.35,38 Besides affecting the energy levels of the SnO2 ESL, long alkyl chains of the APTES SAM function as an insulating barrier, which can effectively prevent electron back transfer, reduce recombination and facilitate electron collection. As shown in Fig. S4a,†J–V curves of SnO2 films with and without APTES SAM modification in the structure of FTO/SnO2/Au show that the conductivity of SnO2 was slightly decreased after APTES SAM modification, confirming the energy barrier formed by the passivation layer (APTES SAM). The excellent diode quality with a very low leakage current and high rectification ratio is clearly seen in the dark J–V curve (Fig. S4b†). And the reduced recombination is in accordance with the decreased leakage current.
To further understand the effect of APTES SAM treatment on the SnO2 ESL, the junction properties at the SnO2/perovskite interface was investigated by a capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurement.47C–V measurements were applied for both the FTO/SnO2/perovskite/Au and FTO/SnO2 + SAM/perovskite/Au devices and their Mott–Schottky curves are depicted in Fig. 4b. The built-in potential (Vbi) can be estimated from the x-intercept of the linear regime in the Mott–Schottky plot (Fig. 2e). The Vbi of the SnO2 + SAM/perovskite heterojunction is about 0.1 V higher than that of the SnO2 + SAM/perovskite heterojunction. As illustrated in Fig. 4a, compared to the untreated SnO2, the decreased WF value of APTES SAM modified SnO2 results in enlarged Vbi and an extended depleted region. Moreover, this built-in field of the depletion region can not only suppress the back transport of electrons from the SnO2 ESL to the perovskite layer, but also assist in the charge separation, charge transport and collection of photo-generated carriers.47,48 Therefore, the introduction of a SAM between SnO2 and the perovskite directly contributes to the enhanced output voltage of the solar cells.

The corresponding depletion regions and built-in voltages are indicated. (b) Mott–Schottky analysis at 1 kHz of SnO2/perovskite and SnO2 + SAM/perovskite heterojunctions. 
It was demonstrated that charge extraction kinetics at the interface is a key parameter determining the device performance. To get insight into the effect of introducing a APTES SAM on electron transfer and extraction at the SnO2/perovskite interface, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements are presented in Fig. 5. As indicated in Fig. 5a, the PL quenching for the perovskite/SnO2 + SAM sample is most efficient, suggesting an enhanced electron extraction ability. Here we observed a blue shift of the PL peak from 776 nm to 768 nm, demonstrating the surface trap state passivation close to the bottom surface of the perovskite film.49,50 And this passivation effect may originate from hydrogen-bonding interactions (N–H⋯I), which can effectively reduce the surface trap states of the perovskite.51 The TRPL result shown in Fig. 5b confirms faster photo-induced electron transfer from perovskite to SnO2 after APTES SAM modification. This is because of the enhanced driving force of photogenerated carriers induced by the enlarged built-in electric field.

3.3. Effect of APTES SAM modification on device performance

Fig. 6 shows the typical photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of regular planar MAPbI3 solar cells based on SnO2 ESLs with different APTES SAM treatment times under simulated one-sun illumination. For the device based on the untreated-SnO2 ESL, a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 20.84 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.065 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.662, and an overall PCE of 14.69% are obtained. The cell efficiencies increase significantly with the 1 and 3 h APTES SAM treated SnO2 ESLs. The respectable efficiency of a 3 h APTES SAM-treated SnO2 ESL is increased to 17.03%, with a JSC of 21.23 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.16 V, and a FF of 0.692. To the best of our knowledge, the obtained VOC is the highest value reported for the MAPbI3 system to date. The performance enhancement is largely attributed to the increase of the VOC value associated with the enhanced Vbi at the SnO2/perovskite interface and passivation effect of the APTES SAM. Meanwhile, the JSC and FF of the APTES SAM-treated device are enhanced together; this is mainly due to the improved perovskite film quality (morphology and crystallinity) and optimized interfacial contact. However, when the treatment time is increased to 15 h, the corresponding device shows a decreased PCE of 14.15%, with a JSC of 19.45 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.085 V, and a FF of 0.671. As the treatment time increases, the nature of insulativity of the APTES SAM enhances the interfacial transfer resistance, leading to inefficient charge collection and decreased JSC. The details of photovoltaic parameters of all these devices are given in Table 1. Encouragingly, the APTES SAM-treated device also exhibited good stability when stored under ambient conditions with a controlled humidity of about 30% and in the dark. The long-term stability test results are shown in Fig. S6.† After being stored for 1000 h, the device with APTES SAM treatment retained 92% of its initial PCE. And the performance degradation of device is mainly ascribed to the decreased JSC.

To further improve the device performance and reduce the hysteretic behavior of planar PSCs, a Pb(SCN)2 additive is employed with the APTES SAM-modified SnO2 ESL, as we previously reported.52 Herein, MAPbI3 films with significantly increased grain size and improved crystallinity are deposited by spin-coating the perovskite precursor with 3% Pb(SCN)2 additive via a solvent engineering method. Fig. S7† shows the top-view SEM images of perovskite films with 3% Pb(SCN)2 additive in the perovskite precursor, which is deposited on a APTES SAM treated SnO2 ESL. It is important to note that the MAPbI3 film with 3% Pb(SCN)2 additive in the precursor shows an obviously enlarged grain size and decreased grain boundary density. Meanwhile, it is clearly seen that PbI2 is present at the grain boundaries of perovskite crystals, which can passivate the trap states at the perovskite grain boundary as reported previously.52Fig. 7a shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the whole device. By fabricating the planar PSC based on APTES SAM modified SnO2 ESLs with 3% Pb(SCN)2 additive, we have achieved a high PCE of 18.32% (17.74%) when measured under reverse (forward) voltage scan and a steady-state efficiency of 17.54% (Fig. 7b, c and Table 2). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the corresponding device is presented in Fig. 7d, and the calculated integrated current density is in agreement with the JSC obtained from the J–V curves. As expected, both interface modification and perovskite film optimization play important roles in obtaining high stabilized efficiency for planar PSCs. The average device performance parameters such as VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE are summarized in Fig. S8.† We note improvements in all device parameters after introducing the APTES SAM. The devices with APTES SAM modification showed an average efficiency of 17.87%, indicating their better reproducibility. In comparison, without APTES SAM modification, an average efficiency of 14.8% was obtained. The significantly improved device performance and better reproducibility demonstrate that APTES SAM modification is a simple and effective strategy to optimize device performance.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated an effective and facile method to improve the performance of planar PSCs by modifying the SnO2 ESL/MAPbI3 interface with APTES SAM surface treatment. We found that the APTES SAM could induce high quality perovskite film formation with a better morphology and enhanced crystallinity. Besides, the APTES SAM interfacial layer can direct favorable dipole moment via the terminal functional group, lowering the work function of SnO2 and tailoring interfacial energy level alignment at the SnO2/MAPbI3 interface. The reduced work function of SnO2 results in an enlarged built-in potential, which assists the charge separation, charge transport and collection. Moreover, this built-in potential as well as the passivation effect of the APTES SAM can effectively suppress the back transport of electrons from SnO2 to the perovskite and reduce the recombination process. These multiple functions of the APTES SAM for interface modification of planar PSCs significantly improve the device performance from 14.69% to 17.03%. To further mitigate the anomalous hysteresis behavior in regular planar PS Cs, a perovskite film with larger grain sizes and less grain boundaries, prepared by adding 3% Pb(SCN)2 in the perovskite precursor, was used to fabricate hysteresis-less planar PSCs using a APTES SAM-modified SnO2 ESL. As a result, we have achieved a PCE of 18.32% (17.74%) when measured under reverse (forward) voltage scan and a steady-state efficiency of 17.54%. We believe that multifunctional APTES SAM interface modification is a simple and effective method for realizing highly efficient planar PSCs.
