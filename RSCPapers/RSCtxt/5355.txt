    , Accepted 16th July 2018First published on 17th July 2018AbstractNanostructured binary copper chalcogenides (NBCCs) have been the subject of extensive research as promising candidates in energy-related and biological applications due to their advantageous properties, environmental compatibility, and abundance. The remarkable properties of these materials is born out of the variable stoichiometry between the copper and chalcogens, as well as the structural versatility, with zero-dimension to three-dimension structures, which consequently improves their electrical, optical, and catalytic properties. Here, the research history and development process of the binary copper chalcogenides are introduced. Typical synthesis strategies for NBCCs vary according to structure dimensionality and specific energy-related and biological applications dependent on the structure and stoichiometry are summarized. The future development of designed nanostructures and tuned stoichiometry in NBCCs for further high-performance applications are outlined.
1. Introduction
Diminishing fossil fuel reserves and pollution associated with the extraction and burning of fossil fuels both drive global efforts to discover clean and renewable energy sources as soon as possible.1–4 Nanostructured binary copper chalcogenides (NBCCs) have revealed excellent performance in current green energy and biological devices due to their advantageous properties, environmental compatibility, and low toxicity. In this sense, the functional properties of NBCCs can be tuned to optimize their performance for thermoelectric,5–7 photovoltaic,8–10 energy storage,11–13 catalytic,14,15 and biological applications.16–18 The outstanding properties of NBCCs, including high carrier concentrations, low thermal conductivity, plasma properties, and band gaps suitable for solar absorption, are mainly based on their variable stoichiometry and structural versatility.19–22 Most of the scientific reviews related to the copper chalcogenides summarize the types of synthetic methods used to prepare them, with compositions ranging from binary to quaternary.23–26 The resulting structures and stoichiometries are highly dependent on the synthesis strategies used. It may be a new perspective to look into the synthesis of nanostructures from zero-dimensions (0D) to three-dimensions (3D) with tuned stoichiometry and relate them to their energy and biological applications.
Being simple compounds, binary copper chalcogenides are composed of copper and chalcogen atoms. Metal-to-metal bonds dominate in copper-rich binary compounds, while in chalcogen-rich binary compounds, the bonds are largely chalcogen-to-chalcogen.29 It is noteworthy that copper chalcogenides bonds are highly covalent and not ionic, although chalcogenides are treated as divalent anions (S2−, Se2−, or Te2−) in some cases. In a basic lattice cell, the chalcogen atoms constitute the frame of a regular lattice, whereas the copper atoms are disordered, moving like a liquid and taking up sites in the chalcogen lattices randomly.27 This phenomenon leads to variations in stoichiometry, which is represented by the characteristic formula Cu2−xE (where E = S, Se, Te) with possible x values ranging from 0 to 1.28 The various stoichiometries determine the different crystal structures of NBCCs. For example, binary copper sulfide systems exhibit dominant crystal phases: Cu31S16 or Cu1.94–1.97S (monoclinic phase), Cu9S5 or Cu1.8S (cubic phase), Cu7S4 or Cu1.75S (orthorhombic phase), Cu58S32 or Cu1.81S (triclinic phase), and CuS (hexagonal phase); binary copper selenide systems have common crystal phases: Cu2Se and Cu1.8Se (cubic phase), Cu3Se2 (tetragonal phase), CuSe and Cu0.87Se (hexagonal phase), Cu5Se4 and CuSe2 (orthorhombic phase); and binary copper telluride systems show common crystal phases: Cu2Te (hexagonal phase), Cu7Te4, Cu4Te3 and Cu3Te2 (tetragonal phase), CuTe (orthorhombic phase), and CuTe2 (pyrite-type compound). All of these phases in copper–chalcogen systems consist of a rigid chalcogen framework and mobile Cu ions in different valence states.23 Thus, the stoichiometric versatility results in defects in the NBCC crystal lattice and varying valence throughout the bulk of the compounds, which contributes to the functional properties of NBCCs.28 One notable example is copper selenide nanoparticles, which become a surprisingly good p-type semiconductor with an electrical conductivity that can be improved by over 3000 times when partially oxidized into non-stoichiometric Cu1.8Se.30 In addition to the stoichiometric versatility of NBCC compounds (Cu2−xE), considerable research effort goes into tailoring the nanostructure of copper chalcogenides, which allows for further enhancement of its desired remarkable properties. For example, highly uniform CuTe nanostructures, such as nanorods, nanoplates, and nanocubes, show potential advantages for biological applications based on the dimensionality of the nanostructures: CuTe nanoplates exhibit great potential for use as probes in photothermal (PT) therapy due to their applicability for the direct detection of oxygen-substituted targets, whereas CuTe nanocubes can induce a high degree of toxicity by the controlled release of toxic ions into a cellular environment by localized heating.31
In this review, we discuss the research history, synthesis strategies, the use of tailored structures in applications, and the future potential of NBCCs based on their intrinsic stoichiometry and customized crystal structures. Synthetic approaches are introduced according to the different dimensional structures of the materials, such as 0D to 3D. Current hot research topics focus on material performance improvement by specific structuring targeting thermoelectric, photovoltaic, energy storage, catalytic, and biological applications. Finally, general perspectives on the possible future applications of NBCCs are outlined.
2. Research history
2.1. Initial discovery
Copper chalcogenides used as energy-related materials have a long research history. In 1821, T. J. Seebeck first published his interesting observations about “thermomagnetism”. He conducted two sets of experiments. One set of experiments involved connecting together two different metals. When heating one junction of the metals, the needle of a compass close to the circuit moved. The other set of experiments involved observing a magnetic field generated by a single metallic element when submitted to a temperature gradient.32 This discovery was named the Seebeck effect, which showed that a conductor generates a voltage when subjected to a temperature difference. Six years later, A. C. Becquerel found that electricity generated in circuits when sulfur powders were burned on copper wires, while no change was observed when sulfur powders were burned on platinum wires. He and his son claimed a new concept “Thermoelectric (TE) battery” based on Cu2S.33 Later, a patent titled “copper sulfide applied to a thermoelectric battery” was submitted by Hermite and Copper in 1900. They attempted to use Cu2S practically in a thermoelectric generator, however, there were two main problems that needed to be solved. One was how to maintain the stable composition of Cu2S in reheating. The other was how to make contact between the copper sulfide and the metal electrode in the device.34 Thus, Cu2S materials were set aside for several decades, even though they are promising thermoelectric candidates.
2.2. Development
Over three centuries, the research on copper chalcogenides has never stopped. In Fig. 1, scientific literature statistics suggest that the research on these materials was not popular at the beginning of the discovery. However, interest in these materials increased exponentially during the 1960s, which was the turning point for the development of copper chalcogenides. It is worth mentioning that their application in photovoltaics experienced a research peak in the early 1980s. This research peak can be correlated to the new conversion efficiency record of (9.15%) for thin-film polycrystalline CdS/Cu2S cells.35 Unfortunately, this research record did not last long due to some limitations and issues relating to the real application of the material, including the sensitivity of cells to moisture, the lattice mismatch between CdS and Cu2S, and the strong diffusion of copper.36–38 These issues highlighted that the conversion efficiency of Cu2S-based solar cells depends on three limitations of the material microstructures: (i) the carrier electron diffusion length decrease and optical band gap increase when measured in water vapor;36 (ii) the average grain size and the distance are not uniform and vertical junctions form between the CdS and Cu2S layers;37 and (iii) there are distinct mechanisms for copper diffusion from Cu2S to the CdS interface.38 As noted in all application areas, including thermoelectric and photovoltaic applications, the literature focusing on binary copper chalcogenides grew rapidly in the late 20th century and early 21st century. There is, however, a next breakthrough due for the improvement of the functional properties of these materials.

2.3. Rediscovery as promising materials
Things changed from 2011 onwards, when A. P. Alivisatos's group published a report about the observation of localized surface plasmonic absorbance in different sized Cu2−xS quantum dots (QDs) with a variety of stoichiometries, different from the previous concept of absorbance from an indirect band gap.39 These phenomena demonstrated that the most critical and significant properties of copper chalcogenides in photovoltaics are due to their copper deficiency in the lattice structures. One year later, X. Shi and L. D. Chen's group reported another new concept called a “phonon-liquid electron-crystal” (PLEC) with a superstructure, which was initially proposed to explain the enhancement of the TE performance in binary copper chalcogenides, such as Cu2−xE (where E = S, Se, Te).27 This new “liquid-like” structure in copper selenides led to materials with reduced thermal conductivity and increased carrier concentration. After that, the copper chalcogenides were rediscovered as “new” and “promising” energy materials for use in many areas. Numerous literature reports focused on the fact that the properties and performance of NBCCs could be improved through the design of specific nanostructures.31,40,41 This allegedly new strategy may be as promising as they claimed. We believe more breakthroughs in the promising applications of the copper chalcogenides will build on this revival of these structures.
3. Synthesis strategies for low-dimensional copper chalcogenides
Synthesis methods for NBCCs can be catagorized into six main types (colloidal synthesis method,42,43 solvothermal and hydrothermal methods,44 solid synthesis method,7 template-directed synthesis methods,45 nanoscale Kirkendall effect-induced method,46 and cation exchange synthesis47,48), alongside other novel methods. The former three methods are direct synthesis approaches, while the rest of the methods are indirect fabrication syntheses.
The colloidal synthesis method operates under oxygen-free and organic phase conditions, which include heat-up approaches and hot-injection approaches. In the heat-up method, all of the ingredients (copper salt precursors, ligands, and organic solvents) are present in the flask at room temperature and are heated up to the desired reaction temperature (Fig. 2a).49 In the hot-injection approach, the chalcogenide precursor is injected into the hot copper precursor in an organic solvent mixture at high-temperature, or vice versa (Fig. 2b).50

The solvothermal synthesis method depends on an autoclave, which is a specialized sealed reaction vessel. There are three components of the autoclave, an inner Teflon liner, an outer stainless steel shell, and a stainless steel cap (Fig. 2c).51–53 In the reaction, all of the ingredients are sealed into the autoclave and put into an oven. Upon an increase in the inner temperature of the autoclave, a high temperature and pressure build within the vessel, which then creates a suitable environment for the reaction. When only using water into the reaction system, the synthesis is called a hydrothermal method. This method can reach the supercritical temperature (374 °C) and pressure (218 atm) of water.52
The solid synthesis of nanostructures is based on high-energy ball-milling methods,54 and solid–gas reactions,55etc. The ball-milling method is a mechanical process, which enables physical and chemical transformations in powdered materials by purposeful design. The reaction is based on the occurrence of collisions between the milling balls and powder materials inside the reactor.56 The collisions are a consequence of the reactor rotating and moving.57 A fraction of the powder is trapped between the colliding surfaces and subjected to mechanical load during every collision (Fig. 2d).58
Template-directed synthesis methods are used to provide the necessary structural framework for assisting in the preparation of 1D nanomaterials. This method can be divided into soft-template and hard-template methods, in which porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) used to be popular, and has since been replaced by other facile hard templates (Fig. 2e).45,59–61
The nanoscale Kirkendall effect-induced method is based on the Kirkendall effect, which is the motion of a boundary layer between two phases that occurs as a consequence of the difference in the diffusion rates of atoms. Different from template-directed methods, the template is consumed during the reaction process (Fig. 2f).46,62
The cation exchange synthesis method, carrying out in solution (ionic or organic solvents), can be used to form otherwise tricky or inaccessible nanostructured shapes and morphologies via the reaction of as-synthesized nanocrystals with the desired cation solution (Fig. 2g).47,48,63,64 The theoretical mechanism of this method is that the anionic frameworks of the copper chalcogenides are similar. When the size of the nanomaterials is sufficiently large, the desired anions replace the pre-located anions in the reaction solution.64
The most reacted Cu precursors used in experiments are copper acetylacetone (Cu(acac)2), cuprous chloride (CuCl), copper chloride (Cu(Cl)2), and copper acetate (Cu(OAc)2), while the most used chalcogenide precursors are S, Se, and Te powders or thiols (R-SH, such as thiourea, 1-dodecanethiol (DDT)) and phosphine ligands (R3P, such as trioctylphosphine (TOP) and tributylphosphine (TBP)). The vast majority of reactions use either oleylamine (OLA), 1-octadecene (ODE), octadecylamine (ODA), or oleic acid (OA) as the organic solvent (Table 1).65–68

The improvement in the performance for applications to some extent rests upon creating desirable and controlled exciting structures, including tunable sizes and various morphologies. Even in the simplest binary compounds Cu–S, Cu–Se, and Cu–Te, modification of the structures of the same stoichiometric compounds could improve the performance. For example, a designed 3D structure of Cu2S nanowire arrays has been shown to have increased power conversion efficiency in quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) by up to 33.5% compared to that of a Cu2S film, which is due to the high surface area that has more active catalytic sites and easy accessibility for an electrolyte.40 In this sense, the performance of these materials in different applications can be targeted to enhance the specific nanostructures from 0D to 3D structures. The following sections will discuss on the direct and indirect synthetic strategies that have been applied for 0D to 3D NBCCs.
3.1. 0D nanostructuring synthesis
0D nanostructures are confined to three dimensions. Semiconductors with this structure displaying unique quantization effects because of charge carriers confined by a potential barrier to small regions of space, such as quantum dots (QDs), with 3D quantum well-confinement, have been studied, looking at the evolution of their numerous interesting chemical and physical fundamental properties with size, such as their high surface areas and active surface plasmon resonance.69 As a typical example of these structures, the size of QDs is from 2 nm to 10 nm, which roughly contains 10 to 1000 atoms. The size determines their properties, which are in between those of bulk materials and discrete molecules or atoms.70 An application for these materials is where Cu2−xE nanocrystals could be fabricated with a size much smaller than 50 nm for producing localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the near-infrared (NIR). The LSPR of nanoparticles of a small size (<50 nm) appears in optical spectra in the form of strong absorption peaks in the NIR region (650–950 nm). This is the fundamental principle behind many bio-applications. Ultrasmall PEGylated Cu2−xSe nanoparticles (∼3.6 nm) can serve as a multifunctional platform for a multimodal imaging-guided PT therapy nanotheranostic agent.41 In energy applications, QD superlattice structures display lower lattice thermal conductivity rather than an increase in the electrical power factor in thermoelectric devices, which enhances the thermoelectric performance to some extent.25,71

3.1.1. Copper sulfide spherical particles. 
A heat-up approach using Cu(acac)2, OLA, and S powder has been used to produce monodisperse Cu2S spherical particles (of around 5.9 ± 0.7 nm in diameter), when the reaction was kept at 200 °C for 2 h.72 The strategies for tuning the size of the particles are prolonging the reaction time and increasing the amount of organic solvent used. For example, one method used Cu(acac)2, OLA, and DDT to produce spherical particles at 200 °C (Fig. 3a).42 The Cu2S spherical particles grew in size from 7.3 nm (10 min) to 9.4 nm (20 min), 10.6 nm (40 min) and 11.8 nm (60 min) with prolonged reaction time (Fig. 3b and c). The size of the Cu2S QDs also increased from 6.1 to 16 nm (average size) when more DDT was added (from 5 to 15 mL DDT) at the same temperature.73 For different stoichiometric ratios of copper sulfide, Cu1.94S spherical particles have been fabricated by heating just Cu(acac)2 and DDT (30 mL) at 200 °C in the absence of OLA. The particle diameter was also tuned by an increase in the reaction time from 10.4 nm (15 min) to 18.4 nm (60 min).42

Most of the reported heat-up methods require reaction temperatures above 200 °C to form a uniform morphology, however, lower temperatures, below 100 °C, are also suitable for producing high-quality Cu2−xS spherical particles. CuS nanoparticles can also be formed by mixing only CuCl2 and aqueous solutions of sodium citrate and sodium sulfide (Na2S), with stirring at 1000 rpm at 90 °C.74
Thioglycolic acid-stabilized CuS nanoparticles were synthesized at 50 °C by heating a CuCl2 solution and thioacetamide (TGA) solution under alkaline conditions.69 At the same reaction temperature of 50 °C, 4.5 ± 0.5 nm Cu2S spherical particles are produced.75 This method involved the addition of ammonium sulfide ((NH4)2S) to CuCl (in a molar ratio of 1:2) in OLA. The reaction of (NH4)2S and CuCl occurs spontaneously, indicated by a sudden color change of the solution from light blue to black. This novel technique can be generalized for organic phase metal sulfide nanocrystal synthesis. Zhang et al. also found that the diameters of particles could be increased (from 4.6 to 6.4 nm and 7.4 nm) by increasing the reaction temperature from 120 °C to 180 °C and 200 °C, respectively. Simultaneously, the crystallinity was further improved by adjusting the reaction temperature to 180 °C for 40 min. Such a one-pot reaction could be scaled up to produce 30 grams of monodisperse spherical particles, which is of benefit for the use of these materials in applications (Fig. 3d).75
A hot-injection approach has been described for the preparation of monodisperse spherical Cu1.8S QDs, where a mixture of dissolved CuCl2, sodium stearate (CuSt2) and ODE was kept in a three-neck flask at 250 °C under a N2 flow. After a sulfur source (DDT) was injected at high temperature, uniform Cu1.8S nanoparticles were formed. The characterization of the Cu1.8S QDs was confirmed by the observation of quantum-confinement effects.43 Using the same strategy, Cu2S QDs were synthesized using a copper precursor in the presence of a high boiling point coordinating solvent. Cu2S nanoparticles with 12 nm diameter were formed after a sulfur source was injected at a high temperature.68
In addition, size-controlled spherical Cu2−xS particles have been formed by the reaction of CuCl and OLA/OA, followed by injection of sulfur powder in OLA. The tuned sizes of the Cu2−xS particles are from 2.8 to 13.5 nm in diameter, which can be controlled by the injection temperature (115 to 140 °C) and growth time (1.5 to 3 min). Interestingly, the selection of OLA or OA as the solvent affects the crystal phase and stoichiometric ratio. Mono-disperse Cu2−xS nanoparticles can be synthesized by injecting S-OA complexes into a mixed Cu+-OLA/OA solution. Pure OLA solvent produces djurleite structured Cu1.94S and pure OLA solvent produces covellite structure CuS (Fig. 3e). But, the size range of the Cu2−xS nanoparticles remains the same (Fig. 3f). Thus, the addition of OA solvent in the synthesis of Cu2−xS induces the oxidation of the copper to produce CuS. This result reveals that the crystal phase and the stoichiometric ratio can be tuned by choosing different ligands in the reaction.65
Switching the sequence of injection of the materials never influences the formation of Cu–S compounds. A mixture of ammonium diethyldithiocarbamate (NH3-DDTC), DDT, and OA was reacted in a flask at 180 °C, then hot-injected with a copper precursor (Cu(acac)2 dissolved in OA), and heated to 110 °C. The as-prepared Cu2S QDs were in the range of 2.5 nm to 6 nm.39,76 Lim et al. reported the fabrication of faceted CuxS nanocrystals by following the strategy of injecting a degassed solution of copper thiobenzoate (CuTB) into TBPT in a hot solution of DDT.77
Solvothermal and hydrothermal methods have both been used to produce Cu–S compound particles. Although experimental evidence has shown that the solvent plays a key role in controlling the stoichiometry and morphology of the copper sulfide crystals, different organic solvents, such as ethylenediamine (EDA), ethyleneglycol (EG), and ethanol, can influence the morphology of copper sulfide, which has been investigated in the solvothermal approach, and there are very few studies that have reported the production of highly uniform and distributed QDs from these syntheses because of the further unclear mechanism of formation.78
A study of the formation, phase-transition, and growth of Cu2−xS in real time was carried at different synthesis temperatures varying between 260 and 340 °C. Nørby et al. revealed that superlattices grow large and extend to a few micrometers, just by increasing the reaction temperature.44 Besides this, a non-heated water-in-oil microemulsion containing nonionic surfactants, thiourea, triton X-100, nonyl phenyl ether surfactant, and the ionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) has been used to prepare Cu2S nanoparticles. Unfortunately, the size of these Cu2S nanoparticles was not directly shown, however, the presence of a sharp absorption peak in the UV-vis absorption spectrum demonstrated the size-quantized particles.79


3.1.2. Copper selenide spherical particles. 
Unlike for Cu2−xS nanoparticles, it is hard to use the heat-up method to fabricate Cu2−xSe QDs or nanoparticles. This is due to the fact that the synthesis of Cu2−xS spherical particles only needs sulfur-based derivatives to serve as a sulfur source and solvent, whereas the synthesis of Cu2−xSe spherical particles relies on the matching of different selenium sources, such as Se powder, selenourea, selenium(IV) oxide, and imidazoline-2-selenone (Table 1), with a suitable solvent.23 The heat-up methods that have been successful have normally involved the separate preparation of a copper precursor and selenium precursor in advance.80,81 For example, the synthesis of Cu2−xSe nanoparticles required the heating of CuSt2 (dissolved CuCl2 and sodium stearate) and Se-ODE together in a mixture of OA, OLA, and ODE from room temperature to 200 °C. The size of the as-synthesized nanoparticles was tuned with average diameters of 4.5, 5.6, 11.2, and 16.8 nm by controlling the reaction temperature from 120 °C to 200 °C, respectively (Fig. 3g and h).80 In particular, by adjusting the ratio of the CuSt2, OA, OLA, and Se-ODE, six-sided prism, hexagonal, octadecahedron-shaped, and triangular structures were obtained. With a similar approach, high-quality triangular Cu2−xSe nanocrystals with sizes ranging from 2.8 to 12 nm, were formed by a one-pot reaction involving Se-ODE and CuSt2 in OLA solvent.82
The hot-injection method used for the fabrication of CuSe QDs involved the injection of only a single-source precursor (Cu(Se2CNEt2) in TOP) in a reaction flask containing tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) at 250 °C. The average diameter of the resulting CuSe QDs was 16 nm in the hexagonal phase, which was characterized by high-resolution TEM. Particle agglomeration is a disadvantage of this method, after a period of 45 min growth time.83 Riha et al. reported that an improved shape control method was achieved, using a mixture of TOPO and octylphosphonic acid (OPA) as the solvent, followed by the simultaneous injection of TOP-Se and TOP-Cu solutions at 300 °C.30 The reaction was continued for another 13 min at a temperature of 285 °C. Cu2Se QDs with an average size of 10.1 ± 0.8 nm were produced in the hexagonal phase. In this method, the temperature was an important factor in controlling the size distribution. Temperatures of above 290 °C or below 275 °C led to uncontrolled growth and broad size distribution. Similarly, if the precursors (TOP-Se and TOP-Cu) were combined in one syringe prior to injection or if a different injection rate was used, the size of the final products was hardly controlled. It is important that the precursors are kept in different syringes and injected at the same rate in the reaction.30 These Cu2Se QDs samples were further investigated after being stored in air for two weeks. The XRD and XPS analysis indicated a solid-state diffusion from Cu2Se to Cu1.8Se, which suggested that the solid-state diffusion of cationic Cu from the particle core to the surface had occurred. Manna's group reported a temperature-influenced, size-selected, and phosphine-free route to produce Cu2−xSe nanocrystals at 300–310 °C in only 15 min.84,85 Se powder dissolved in ODE as a solvent and OLA as both a reductant and ligand were used, and injected into anhydrous CuCl with OLA and ODE in a flask at 300–310 °C. It was noted that higher temperatures above 315 °C resulted in a bimodal size distribution, specifically producing smaller cuboctahedral shaped Cu2−xSe particles with an average size of 16 nm.85 Using only OLA as the solvent, Cu2−xSe QDs were formed by the injection of Se-OLA into Cu-OLA solution at 210 to 220 °C. In the first five minutes after injection, the particles appeared quite monodisperse. The final results showed that the product QDs were a mixture of CuSe and Cu2Se phases with an estimated ratio of 35.7 to 64.3%. Interestingly, the purity of the purchased OLA solvent can influence the morphology of Cu2−xSe QDs. A higher purity of solvent tends to produce particles instead of a small number of nanodisks.65 Alternatively, selecting selenourea as a selenium source also works in a hot-injection approach. In the reaction, two hot reactant solutions of CuCl and selenourea in OLA were combined at 240 °C for 30 min to form Cu2−xSe QDs with 16 nm diameter (Fig. 3i).86 In the reaction process, the hydrophobic OLA-capped nanocrystals were coated with an amphiphilic polymer composed of a poly(maleic anhydride) backbone with hydrophilic carboxylic acid groups and hydrophobic OLA side chains (Fig. 3j).
A successful hydrothermal method for the fabrication of Cu2−xSe nanoparticles was undertaken by placing CuI and Se powders in a Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave at 90 °C for 4 h. The resulting size of the Cu2−xSe nanoparticles varied from 15 to 20 nm (average 18 nm), while increased temperatures (i.e. 180 °C) were noted to form larger particles of 100 nm in diameter.87
Solid synthesis is a facile strategy to form nanoparticles in bulk or powder materials. For example, Cu and Se powders were mixed in a stoichiometric ratio and milled in a high-energy ball mill for an optimized period of 50 hours. The ball-to-powder weight ratio and rotating speed both influence the size of the products. The nanoparticles formed a structure with a strongly decreased lattice thermal conductivity.54


3.1.3. Copper telluride spherical particles. 
Using the solvothermal method, homogeneous Cu7Te4 particles with an average diameter of 15 nm were fabricated from an aqueous solution of CuCl2 and dissolved Te in ethylenediamine (EDA) solvent that was placed in a Teflon lined autoclave at 160 °C for 10 h.88 In contrast, the hydrothermal method produced larger sized Cu2Te particles of 30 nm. In the synthesis, Cu and Te powders were mixed with deionized water, ethylene glycol (EG), and hydrazine hydrate in a volume ratio of 7:3:1 in a flask. The solution was then refluxed under vigorous stirring at 70 °C for 9 h.89
The cation exchange reaction is a facile and novel strategy for producing highly uniform and dispersed Cu2−xTe nanospheres. Kriegel et al. described the formation of Cu2−xTe via CdTe nanospheres with well-defined morphologies, in which the CdTe nanospheres acted as “sacrificial templates” (Fig. 3k).90
Alternatively, a room-temperature synthesis for metal chalcogenide nanostructures has been reported by Han et al. Cu2Te nanoparticles with a size of 11.7 ± 3.5 nm were immediately formed by adding an aqueous solution of CuCl2 into a NaBH4 reduced selenium precursor solution.91 The sizes of the Cu2Te nanoparticles in this synthesis were strongly dependent on the initial morphologies of the copper source.
In general, 0D structures include QDs and spherical particles, which are several nanometers in size.92 A number of approaches, generally including colloidal synthesis methods, solvothermal and hydrothermal methods, solid synthesis methods, and cation exchange methods, have been used to synthesize 0D NBCCs. Solvothermal/hydrothermal methods tend to result in the preparation of large scale products, but the main disadvantage of these techniques is that it is hard to control the size of the resulting spherical particles. Besides this, using different organic solvents in the solvothermal method, such as ethylenediamine (EDA), EG, and ethanol, can influence the morphology of the formed nanocrystals. Highly uniform and dispersed nanoparticles can be more reliably produced using the heat-up, hot-injection, and cation exchange methods. Among these methods, the particle sizes can be easily tuned in the heat-up method by controlling the reaction temperature and time. The nanoparticles grow from several nanometers to more than ten nanometers upon an increase in the temperature and prolonged reaction time. However, all of these methods result in a low yield and require several steps instead of a one-pot synthesis. The ball-milling method is a high-yield strategy, but the production of impurities and structural imperfections by patterning are the main disadvantages of this approach.

3.2. 1D nanostructuring synthesis
1D nanostructures such as nanowires, nanorods, nanobelts, and nanotubes, whose lateral dimensions fall anywhere in the range of 1 to 100 nm,93 provide good morphologies for testing theoretical predictions on dimensionality effects, especially extremely thin nanowires with large aspect ratios.94 They show great enhancement of electrical, thermal, and mechanical transport properties for use inside quantum wires by an additional quantum confinement effect.25,30 They also display advantages in fabricating electronic, optoelectronic, electrochemical, and electromechanical devices as interconnects and functional units.93,95 1D Cu2−xSe nanowire bundles show good sensitivity, ideal linearity, quick response/recovery and long lifespan when used as photoluminescence-type sensor in a vast humidity range at room temperature.95

3.2.1. Copper sulfide nanowires and nanorods. 
A solvothermal method to form Cu2S nanowires with diameters of 2.5 and 1.7 nm was reported by Liu et al. In a typical procedure, sodium diethyl dithiocarbamate (NaS2CNEt2) was added into a solution of CuCl2 in a DDT and OA mixed solvent. The reaction mixture was sealed in a Teflon bottle and then heated at 160 °C for 12 h.96 Besides this, a simple organic amine-assisted hydrothermal process has been proposed by Zhao's group. Self-assembled Cu1.8S nanowire-like aggregates (with an average diameter of 120 nm and a length of 2 μm) were synthesized comprising Cu1.8S nanoparticles with triethylenediamine (TEDA) as a linking agent.97
A solid–gas reaction was performed on copper foil under H2S gas at room temperature to fabricate Cu2S/CuxO (x = 1, 2) core/shell nanowire arrays in 15 h. Pure Cu2S nanowire arrays with 10–100 nm diameters were obtained after the oxide shell layer was easily removed by 1 M HCl in 20 min.98 After being deposited into an electrolyte, the Cu2S nanowire arrays were used for the preparation of Cu2S/CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2 (Cu2S/CIGS) core/shell nanowire arrays. When thermal annealing these nanowire arrays, the surface of the Cu2S/CIGS core/shell nanowire becomes smooth, and there is no collapse of the nanowires during the process (Fig. 4a).

In addition, single-source molecular precursors have been used because of the potential for side reactions between the Cu and S sources. A solventless thermolytic method was first reported in 2003 by the Korgel group to produce monodisperse Cu2S nanostructures. Later, Chen et al. found that uniform and orientation-arranged Cu2S nanowires, with 2–6 nm diameters and lengths of up to several micrometers, could be synthesized by controlling the stirring speed and reaction time. The formation of nanowires relies on the attainment of a high degree of polymerization of the thiolate precursor through very gentle stirring. Otherwise, a low polymerization of the thiolate precursor dissolved by a high stirring speed results in the synthesis of Cu2S nanorods under identical reaction conditions (Fig. 4b).94 Cu2S nanorods could be easily synthesized using this solventless thermolytic method.99,100 In the work of Korgel's group, a mixture of copper complexed with thiol and carboxylate ligands was evaporated, then the solid residue was heated to 148 °C for 140 min. Cu2S nanorods with 4 nm diameters and 12 nm in length were prepared and scaled up to 10–20 mg.99
Using the hot-injection technique, Kruszynska et al. reported that the length of Cu2−xS nanorods could be tuned between 10 and 100 nm by choosing an appropriate reaction temperature (Fig. 4c).101 Longer nanorods formed in the reaction solution at a lower nucleation temperature, while higher temperatures led to the formation of shorter nanorods. The length of the nanorods can also be changed by the concentration of the copper monomers used. A low concentration of Cu results in short nanorods, while longer rods are obtained with higher Cu concentrations. The above is the first report of the direct formation of size-tunable Cu2−xS nanorods.
The above-mentioned cation exchange approach, using as-synthesized CdS nanorods for ion exchanging with Cu+, was also used to synthesize Cu2S nanorods.102,103 Partial and full exchange of CdS nanorods to Cu2S nanorods can be achieved by adjusting the molar ratio of Cu+ cations relative to Cd2+ in this method.


3.2.2. Copper sulfide nanotubes. 
Most Cu2−xS nanotube structures are based on template-directed synthesis. For example, Cu nanowires have been used as sacrificial templates to form uniform CuS nanotubes of 30–90 nm in inner diameter and 20–50 nm in thickness, retaining the original 1D shape of the Cu nanowires by solvothermal synthesis, where suitable sulfur sources and solvent played crucial roles in the formation of the resulting well-defined CuS nanotubes (Fig. 4d).104 Wu et al. noted that suitable sulfur sources play a key role in the formation of nanotubes because of the detection of ionic sulfur compounds larger than molecular sulfur in the decomposition process, which means that thiourea and thioacetamide rather than sulfur powders are more suitable for this fabrication. In addition, a similar reaction in water media cannot produce such nanotubes.104,105 Similar to the above method, nanotube-like structures (with diameters ranging from 40 to 200 and lengths from 400 nm to 4 μm) were assembled by Cu1.97S nanoparticles.97


3.2.3. Copper selenide nanowires. 
In some cases, nanowires are assembled from small nanocubes. For example, both tetragonal and cubic phase Cu2Se nanowires were formed via a template-directed synthesis by Cu nanowires in a Se precursor solution (Fig. 4e).106 The reaction temperature and ripening time greatly influence the kinetics of the transformation reaction and phase structure control of the Cu2Se nanowires.
In the work of Xu et al., Cu2−xSe nanowire bundles with diameters of 100–300 nm and lengths of up to hundreds of micrometers were synthesized using an aqueous approach (Fig. 4g). This synthesis is novel, and only involves the reaction of Cu(NO3)2, Se powder, NaOH, and distilled H2O in a beaker without using any surfactant or template, then the beaker is placed in a fan-controlled oven at 140 °C for 5 h. With the process of the reaction, initially formed CuSe nanocrystals transform to CuSe nanoplates and dissolve to produce Cu2−xSe nanowire bundles, which grow in one direction (Fig. 4h).95,107


3.2.4. Copper selenide nanotubes. 
In the work of Chen et al., stable Se (or S) powders were used as suitable sources to prepare Cu2−xSe (or Cu2−xS) micro-/nanotubes with a hierarchical architecture by using Cu nanowire templates in a room temperature reaction (Fig. 4i and j).108 The theoretical prediction of these reactions has been demonstrated using the DMol3 module in the Materials Studio software package. In the reacted system, Se (or S) powders can be dissolved in thiolate to first form selenothiolate (or thiosulfide) ions. The surface Cu reacts with selenothiolate (or thiosulfide) to form a thin layer of nanosheets on the Cu nanowires, resulting in a Cu@Cu2−xSe (or Cu2−xS) core–shell structure, in which the internal Cu is still solid. Increasing the reaction time led to the formation of Cu2−xSe (or Cu2−xS) micro-/nanotubes.109 Differently, Zhang et al. proposed that trigonal Se nanotubes can also be used as a template-directing reagent for the fabrication of CuSe nanotubes. Additionally, adjusting the elemental ratio of Cu and Se in the precursors resulted in the formation of different stoichiometric copper selenides (Cu3Se2, Cu2−xSe, and Cu2Se).110


3.2.5. Copper telluride nanowires, nanorods, and nanotubes. 
Te nanowires have been used as a template, reacted with a Cu precursor, to form Cu1.75Te nanowires. The as-synthesized Te nanowires have an average diameter and length of 7 ± 1 nm and ∼5 μm, respectively, while the average diameter of the Cu1.75Te nanowires increased to 10 ± 2 nm after conversion.55
Besides cation exchange reactions with CdS nanocrystals, using as-prepared CdTe nanorods for ion exchange with Cu+ resulted in the synthesis of Cu2Te nanorods of around 5 nm in width and 21 nm in length.90 In addition, direct hot-injection synthesis of CuTe nanorods has also been reported. The procedure is based on the reaction of CuCl with TOP-Te in the presence of lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (LiN(SiMe3)2) and OLA. The presence of the lithium salt in the synthesis has been observed to have beneficial effects on the monodisperse CuTe nanorods, as well as other morphologies such as nanocubes and nanoplates.31
An aqueous growth method was used to prepare Cu2Te nanotubes from Cu2E (E = O, S, Se) nanoparticles at room temperature. The as-prepared Cu2Se nanoparticles and Te precursor were mixed at room temperature and stirred for 30 min under the protection of inert gas, and Cu2Te nanotube structures were obtained. This is a fast, cost-effective, and green strategy that can be used to synthesize 1D NBCCs.111
In summary, the formation of 1D copper sulfide nanowires and nanorods is more focused on colloid methods, including solvothermal, hot-injection, and solventless thermolytic methods. The diameters and lengths of the 1D copper sulfide nanostructures can be easily tuned by changing the reaction temperature, time, and concentration of the thiolate precursors. In contrast, 1D copper selenide and copper telluride nanowires and nanorods are commonly fabricated by cation exchange synthesis and template-directed synthesis methods. Their morphology and size are highly dependent on those of the as-prepared precursors or templates, but are hardly tailored upon further modification. Nanotube structures of these NBCCs are preferentially formed from Cu nanowire templates, which also determined by the template size and require further steps in the reaction process.

3.3. 2D Nanostructuring synthesis
2D periodic patterns in structures have unique physical phenomena that occur when charge and heat transport is confined to a plane.112 They present excellent electronic properties brought about by a quantum-well effect and a high specific surface area, which means that they can be used in energy conversion, energy storage, catalysis and biological applications.113 For example, in thermoelectric research, a few groups have proposed a quantum-well phenomenon, which enhances the Seebeck coefficients of semiconductor materials.25 Besides this, 2D copper sulfide nanosheet composites used as a supercapacitor present a high specific capacitance and good cycling stability.114 2D copper selenide nanoplates, with a wide and tunable absorption band in the visible and near-infrared region, have the potential for assembling nano-photonic devices in the near-infrared.115 Copper telluride nanoplates, compared to nanocubes and nanorods, display a more comprehensive near-infrared optical absorption, which allows them to be uses as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) probes and in PT therapy.31

3.3.1. Copper sulfide nanoplates, nanosheets, and nanodisks. 
When the heat-up approach is used for Cu2−xS nanoplate fabrication, the size and morphology of the Cu2−xS nanoplates remain unaltered with changes to the copper precursor concentration. After the nanoplates are formed, the as-synthesized nanoplates tend to assemble face-to-face into columns.116 A heat-up synthesis of Cu2S nanosheets has been investigated by using a liquid crystal-like molecular template. It noted that short chain precursors produce 2D nanosheets of Cu2S, while longer-chained variants produce Cu2S nanodisks exclusively.117
Ultrathin Cu2−xS nanosheets (2 nm thickness) with well-defined shape and size were synthesized by hot-injection with the modification of adding SnBr4 or SnCl4 to the reaction mixture. The thickness of these ultrathin nanosheets could be adjusted from 100 nm to 3 μm.118 In this reaction, halides (Br− or Cl−) and the copper–thiolate metal–organic frame formed a soft template, which allowed the growth of a 2D nanosheet structure (Fig. 5a). These as-synthesized nanosheets never fold or aggregate when serving as building blocks in self-organized superstructures. Gao et al. also demonstrated that the use of different amounts of SnCl4 in the reaction system could lead to Sn-doped ultrathin Cu31S16 nanosheets of 209 ± 33 nm and nanoplates of 36.0 ± 5.9 nm.119 It turns out that Sn ions can control the shape of products and nanosheet growth in different phases (Fig. 5b). Without foreign ions, ultrathin CuS nanosheets with very high purity were synthesized using hot-injection methods at 95 °C for 18 h. The CuS nanosheets displayed a high aspect ratio with an average plane length (453 ± 6 nm) and thickness (3.2 ± 0.2 nm), corresponding to two unit cells (the lattice constant of a unit cell of CuS is about 1.6 nm) (Fig. 5c and d).120

Some literature reports have described the same self-assembly phenomenon of CuS nanodisks and Cu1.75S nanodisks with two stacked dimensions by hot-injection methods.66,121 Size-controlled Cu2S nanocrystals with nanodisk morphologies were formed in a hot-injection approach, involving the injection of DDT at 160 °C into a hot solution containing cuprous acetate (CuOAc), TOPO, and ODE. The size of the nanodisks could be increased from 13.1 ± 0.9 nm to 16.9 ± 2.3 nm by raising the reaction temperature from 160 to 190 °C, while monodisperse nanodisks start to assemble with a further rise in the temperature, from 200 °C and 220 °C.67 Li et al. observed that the accurate control of the size and morphology of Cu2−xS nanocrystals, from spheres and disks to tetradecahedra and dodecahedra, depends on an oriented attachment and growth mechanism (Fig. 5e). Injecting di-tert-butyl disulfide (TBDS) into a hot solution of CuCl2 initially produces Cu2−xS spherical nanoparticles. Then the spherical nanoparticles evolve into circular nanodisks at an early stage. With a prolonged reaction time, the circular nanodisks became hexagonal Cu1.96S nanodisks. It was noted that higher temperatures and longer reaction times increased the crystallinity and diameter of the nanodisks, while the thickness, crystallographic phase, and composition of the nanodisks were only slightly affected by these factors.122 At room temperature, the formation of CuS nanoplates was involved the multiple injection of ammonium sulfide (AS) into a mixture of CuCl2, OLA, and toluene precursor, where the size (4.3 to 34 nm in diameter) was depended on the manner in which AS was injected into the mixture solution of Cu precursor.123
Hexagonal CuS nanoplates, with a diameter of 26 ± 1.5 nm and a thickness of 8 ± 1.2 nm, were successfully fabricated using an improved solvothermal approach in toluene with hexadecylamine (HDA) as the capping agent. The hexagonal nanoplates were found to self-assemble into pillar-like, raft-like, and stratiform nanostructures (Fig. 5f).124 Non-stoichiometric copper sulfide nanosheets were synthesized via a solvothermal approach using copper ammonium solution and thiourea in sealed autoclaves at a low temperature of 60 °C for 3 h. Through adjusting the redox atmosphere, sheet-like Cu9S8 and needle-like CuS nanocrystals were obtained from the freshly formed Cu9S8 nanocrystals.125 Unique CuS flakes with an average size of 400 nm were formed in the microemulsion under hydrothermal conditions at 130 °C for 15 h. With the pre-addition of DDT to the microemulsion, the morphology of the Cu2S could be tailored to form small hexagonal nanodisks with a diameter of 20 nm and thickness of 6 nm.126
A solventless synthesis was reported for monodisperse Cu2S nanoplates, which can self-assemble into ribbons with a stacked orientation.100 Another self-assembly example is that where close-packed superlattices were constructed from nanocrystal building blocks independently of the synthesis temperature. In some cases, the superlattices were very large and extended up to a few micrometers along one dimension.44 Nørby et al. revealed that self-assembled Cu2S nanodisks exist in three arrangements. Some nanodisks tend to be perpendicular to the substrate, some nanodisks lie flat on the substrate with apparent overlap between neighboring nanodisks, and other nanodisks were tilted with regard to the substrate (Fig. 5g).


3.3.2. Copper selenide nanoplates, nanosheets, and nanodisks. 
Stoichiometric CuSe hexagonal platelets with sizes larger than 100 nm were also fabricated using a hot-injection method by Manna's group.85 A new selenium source, air-stable 1,3-dimethylimidazoline-2-selenone, was introduced in the hot-injection method, in which the obtained Cu2−xSe nanodiscs have an average diameter of 17 ± 1 nm and a thickness of 2.6 ± 0.9 nm, respectively.127 Previous to this work, berzelianite Cu2−xSe nanoplates and nanosheets were reported by Deng et al. The as-prepared 2D Cu2−xSe structures were found to have diameters in the range of 200–300 nm or 1.0–2.5 μm and a thickness range of 25–30 nm or 12–30 nm (Fig. 5h and i).128
Hierarchical self-decorated Cu2−xSe nanosheets with a diameter of ∼3 μm and thickness of ∼50 nm were formed using a solvothermal method. The surface of the nanosheets was covered by uniform nanoparticles with a size of ∼50 nm. The growth mechanism was investigated by conducting time-dependent experiments. Interestingly, the nanosheet structure arose via a shape-evolution process. In the first stage, irregular Cu2O and CuO nanocubes were obtained. Then, they transformed into small Cu2−xSe nanosheets and grew larger when the reaction time was prolonged (Fig. 5j).129 Or simply, with the copper substrate in the reaction system, Cu2−xSe nanosheets have been fabricated using a hydrothermal route.130
Remarkably, cubic Cu2−xSe nanosheets can be transformed from micro-sized CuSe nanosheets without any morphology change through simple heat treatment in the presence of CuI cations (Fig. 5l).131 A possible mechanism was proposed where the structure of klockmannite CuSe with a low occupancy of Cu cations served as an effective template for the further insertion of Cu cations and the formation of antifluorite Cu2−xSe. Alternatively, ultrathin, air stable, and thickness-controlled Cu2−xSe nanosheets have been synthesized via cation exchange from CdSe nanosheets, the mechanism of which is similar to that of the CuxS nanocrystals formed from the CdxS nanocrystals mentioned previously.132


3.3.3. Copper telluride nanodisks. 
Uniform Cu2Te nanodisks were prepared using a similar hot-injection method as that above by adding TOP-Te into a Cu precursor solution, where the reaction time and growth temperature were also used to tune the thickness and diameter of the nanodisks.31,133
The formation of Cu2Te nanosheets has been rarely reported by direct synthesis methods. However, Cu2Te nanosheets have been shown to be easily transformed from Cu2E (E = O, S, Se) nanoparticles in aqueous solution using the same method as the preparation of Cu2Te nanotubes. The formation of Cu2Te nanosheets was revealed through a novel exchange-peeling growth mechanism instead of a simple Kirkendall effect, and the resultant nanosheets could be further rolled up into nanotube structures with the assistance of stirring during the reaction.111
To sum up, colloid synthesis methods (heat-up and hot-injection methods) and solvothermal/hydrothermal methods are common strategies used to form 2D Cu2−xS and Cu2−xSe nanostructures. The morphology of nanoplates and nanodisks prepared using these methods are uniform and dispersed, and can be easily self-assembled in ordered arrangements by adjusting the temperature and reaction time. The thickness of them can also be adjusted by changing the solvents and reaction temperature. However, the size or diameter of the nanoplates and nanodisks is hard to increase to over 500 nm using these methods, for further application needs. Some novel approaches, such as shape-revolution and exchange-peeling growth, are unique to a particular composition or morphology, but do not widely extend to general synthesis.

3.4. 3D Nanostructuring synthesis
3D nanostructures, such as hollow structures and flower-like structures with a large surface area and internal voids offer super performance for use in advanced energy storage and conversion applications.134 Hollow structures with functional shells and inner cavities display low density, large surface area, and other structure related charge transport properties.134 Similarly, flower-like structures with a space between their building blocks show high absorption and a large catalyst surface area. For example, flower-like CuS superstructures have been shown to work as an efficient 980 nm laser-driven photothermal agent for the removal of cancer cells. The as-formed CuS superstructures exhibit higher NIR photothermal conversion efficiency, improved by approximately 50% compared to that of their corresponding building blocks (hexagonal nanoplates).135

3.4.1. Copper sulfide hierarchical and hollow structures. 
CuS hierarchical and hollow structures have previously been fabricated using a simple and surfactant-free solvothermal method. The results show that CuS nanorods and nanoplates self-assemble to form microspheres and then these microspheres aggregate resulting in a hierarchical and hollow morphology upon an increase in the reaction time.136 Using the hydrothermal method, CuS nanospheres with hollow interiors were formed using a trinuclear building block [Cu3(HSser)3(H2O)2] 2H2O as a precursor, while changing the precursor to [Cu(H2Sser)2]·H2O, resulted in the CuS changing to adopt a hierarchical flower-like morphology.137
Flower-like Cu2−xS structure synthesis has also mostly been reported using solvothermal/hydrothermal methods.138 In the solvothermal method, covellite CuS flower-like architectures, formed from congregated nanoplates, with a thickness of 20–100 nm have been synthesized using a solvothermal method. In a typical synthesis, Cu(NO3)2, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), PVP and sulfur powder were pre-dissolved and transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. By using thiourea or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) instead of sulfur powder, hierarchical doughnut-shaped and superstructured spherical-shaped CuS structures were formed using the same process.139 By using the solvothermal approach, hierarchical flower-like CuS hollow nanospheres with a size of 200 nm were prepared with the desired surface morphology by tuning the reaction conditions. The surface of each hierarchical flower-like CuS hollow sphere was covered with many nanoflakes with a thickness of around 10 nm.140 Besides this, using the same solvothermal approach conditions as mentioned, different solvents such as EDA, EG, and ethanol were found to influence the morphology. Using EDA as the solvent, well-defined flower-like Cu2S crystals were formed.78
Using the hydrothermal approach, flower-like CuS superstructures have also been formed using an altered S precursor, sodium sulfide (Na2S). The formation process can be tuned by altering the reaction time, in which short reaction times (12 h) lead to the formation of CuS hexagonal nanoplates, while a longer reaction time of over 48 h results in the formation of CuS superstructures.135 Ball-flower shaped CuS hollow structures have been formed using a hydrothermal method with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) as the surfactant. The concentration ratio of CuCl2 and thiourea or the reaction temperature were found to significantly influence the morphology of the products.141
Under hydrothermal conditions, a self-sacrificial soft-template method, based on the reaction of copper(II) sulfate (CuSO4), carbon disulfide (CS2), triton X-100, and cyclohexane, was used to fabricate CuS hollow spheres with diameters of ∼200 nm and thin shells of ∼30 nm. The key point of the reaction is that the as-generated water–oil (W/O) micelles acted as soft templates for the formation of the hollow CuS spheres. Therefore, the initial size of the micelle templates strongly influenced the final morphology of the hollow CuS spheres. This soft-template method is convenient, controllable, and avoids the introduction of impurities for the formation of hollow structures.142 To some extent, the thickness of the shell in a hollow structure varies when using different reactants. Thick-shell and thin-shell CuS hollow spheres were obtained via a hydrothermal method using CuBr2 and (C4H9)4NBr solutions, respectively (Fig. 6a–d).62 Li et al. reported that highly ordered CuS porous flower-like microspheres and hollow microspheres could also be prepared using the hydrothermal method, in which the Cu and S precursors served as self-sacrificial templates and the ratio of CuCl2 and L-cysteine influenced the morphologies of the products (Fig. 6e).143

Specifically, cage structures, beyond the common hollow structure, exhibited inherent high symmetry and regular shapes.144 Cu2O nanocages are the most common templates for the formation of NBCC cage structures. Using Cu2O nanocages as sacrificial templates and HCl solution to etch and dissolve the inner core, truncated cubic and octahedral Cu2S nanocages have been synthesized with a wall thickness of 10–20 nm (Fig. 6f).59 Similarly, highly symmetrical 18-faceted Cu7S4 nanocrystal polyhedra with a regular hollow nanocage morphology were synthesized from Cu2O templates under heating conditions. It was noted that the initial formation of a thin layer of Cu7S4 on the surface of the Cu2O templates contributed to the formation of the hollow structures. This thin layer acted as an interface and separated the inner copper ions or Cu2O from the outer sulfur ions. Then, further reaction of the copper and sulfur depended on the diffusion through this interface. The outside sulfur shell formed lots of vacancies and combined with the copper ions on the interface, which generated void and induced the conversion to Cu7S4 nanocrystals.145


3.4.2. Copper selenide and copper telluride hollow structures. 
Hollow Cu2−xSe nanocages were converted from Cu2O nanocrystals at room temperature, based only on the Kirkendall effect, by Cao et al.146 A novel hybrid metal–semiconductor nanocage morphology was achieved using a template-free method, in which metal cages formed on the edges of the NBCC seeds. In addition, the inside of the NBCC seeds could be etched by adding neocuproine in chloroform, leaving pure and symmetrical metal cages.144,147
Combining the nanoscale Kirkendall effect-induced method and a colloidal synthesis method proved to be more effective in the controllable formation of hollow structures. For example, Cu2−xTe hollow nanostructures with an average size of about 23 nm were formed using a hot-injection method. The structure evolution is shown in Fig. 6h–l. Firstly, the solid Cu nanoparticles grew and ripened from the nucleus when a Cu(acac)2 solution was kept at 250 °C in DDT. After the injection of a TOP-Te solution, the Cu2−xTe hollow nanostructures formed.148 Similarly, Cu2−xTe nanocrystals in a hollow structure were tailored to a solid structure by adjusting the injection times (Fig. 6g and h). The reaction mechanism was based on the nanoscale Kirkendall effect, where copper nanoparticles were generated first and then the Cu2−xTe hollow structures formed after TOP-Te injection.149
All in all, the formation of hollow structures and flower-like structures depend upon the prepared precursors, building blocks, or templates used in the reaction system, which means that the morphologies of these hierarchical structured NBCCs can be controlled by tuning the size and morphology of the precursors, building blocks, or templates. On the other hand, the morphology of NBCCs is confined to these factors. In solvothermal and hydrothermal systems, the solvent type, concentration, reaction time, and temperature are key factors that affect the formation of precursors and building blocks. In template-directed syntheses, the nanoscale Kirkendall effect and Ostwald ripening effect are the underlying mechanisms behind the transformation reactions from the templates to the final products.

4. Tailored nanostructures in common applications
The electrical, thermal, optical, and catalytic properties of NBCC semiconductors play an important role in energy conversion and storage applications. Nanodot material systems can enhance the thermoelectric performance because of a strong decrease in the lattice thermal conductivity rather than an increase in the electrical power factor. Hierarchical structures with a huge surface area and void space can offer a large number of reaction or catalytic sites in photovoltaic and energy storage applications. The tunable stoichiometric ratios and compositions in NBCCs enable the properties of these semiconductors to be adjusted for applications (Table 2). The following section will introduce several specific examples in thermoelectric, photovoltaic, battery, catalytic, and biological applications to explain designed nanostructures that have great structural advantages for use in the above mentioned energy applications.

4.1. p-type TE materials
TE conversion is the direct conversion of heat into electricity and vice versa.150–155 When heat flows across the device, the temperature difference between the hot side and cold side of the device drives the electrical current to force, and while the current flows across the device, it heats or cools (Fig. 7a). In a working TE device, an electrical circuit is formed from segments of p-type and n-type semiconductor materials connected via an electrical conductor (copper). A TE generator module contains many pairs of segments in an ordered construction. When heat flows into one side of the module, electrons move from the p-type materials to the n-type materials and generate power directly. A heating/cooling module has the same construction as a generator module. When a current enters into the segments, one side of the module absorbs heat and the other side removes heat.21 The efficiency of a TE device, determined by electrons passing from p-type materials to n-type materials, can be improved via optimization of the properties of the TE materials. The dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) expresses the efficiency of TE materials. ZT = S2σT/κ, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is the electrical conductivity, κ is the thermal conductivity, and T is the absolute temperature.156 The higher the ZT value demonstrated the better the TE performance of the semiconductor materials. To achieve a high TE performance, large S and σ values, as well as a low κ value are required simultaneously. However, these three parameters are strongly interdependent, making it a challenge to improve upon existing ZT values.5

To enhance the TE performance, there are two main strategies: designing nanostructures and tuning compositions. Nanostructures, in the form of quantum wells and superlattices, have been predicted as promising structures, with extraordinary TE performance comparing to bulk structures.25 As bulk TE materials, binary copper chalcogenides have been restricted by low ZT values (ZT < 1) for a long time.157,158 E. Hirahara studied their electrical and thermal behavior in 1947.159 He revealed that three polymorphic phases of Cu2S show very different electrical behavior, namely the α phase below 110 °C, the β phase between 110 °C and 470 °C, and the γ phase at higher temperatures.160,161 Miyatani et al. observed that when the current is large enough, precipitation of copper takes place at the cathode, drastically modifying the distribution of the electric field, which was the first report on the observation of copper precipitation in Cu2S when a voltage gradient is applied.162 As an example of non-stoichiometric copper sulfide, polycrystalline Cu1.8S compounds have been fabricated using a combined process of mechanical alloying and spark plasma sintering. A Cu1.8S sample with a second Cu1.96S phase and a lot of micropores was synthesised, with a maximum ZT value of 0.5 at 673 K, which was the highest value for a p-type sulfide TE material at the time.163
In 2012, a new concept “superionic conductors” was proposed to explain the extraordinarily low thermal conductivity and enhanced TE performance of some superstructure materials.164 X. Shi and L. D. Chen's group reported extremely low values of κL below 0.35 W m−1 K−1 and high values of ZT of around 1.7 for Cu2−xS with a slight copper deficiency (Fig. 7b and c).165 Upon an increase in the copper deficiency from Cu2S to Cu1.98S, and to Cu1.97S, the hole concentration was significantly increased from an order of 1018 cm−3 to 1020 cm−3, leading to increased electrical conductivity and reduced thermal conductivity. All of the Cu2−xS samples show three different types of behavior in the temperature range from 300 to 1000 K (Fig. 7c). This behaviour corresponds to the three different crystal structures mentioned above. The stoichiometric Cu2S compound undergoes two phase transitions. One is at around 370 K and the other is at around 700 K. Below 370 K, Cu2S crystallizes in a low chalcocite γ-phase (L-chalcocite), which is a normal solid. Above 370 K, it converts into a superionic conductor phase, which is called a high chalcocite β-phase (H-chalcocite). Above 700 K, β-Cu2S further transforms to an α-phase with a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure.
Similar to copper sulfide, copper selenide adopts simple crystal structures. In the fcc crystal structure of Cu2Se, there are two different sub-lattices inside its crystal structure, in which the sub-lattice frame of selenium atoms provides a pathway for the movement of semiconducting electrons, and the highly disordered copper ions move through the selenium lattice frame with “liquid-like mobility” and high diffusivities, in the order of 10−5 cm2 s−1 (Fig. 7d). This extraordinary and special structure of Cu2Se results in an intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity, which can result in a high ZT value. So, retaining the same the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity, a lower total thermal conductivity can be a good measure of an ideal TE material. The results uncovered “a new strategy and direction for high-efficiency TE materials explores the structures where a crystalline sublattice frames for electronic movement surrounded by liquid-like ions”.166–168 Liu et al. reported a ZT of 1.5 at 1000 K for Cu2−xSe in a β-phase based on this theory. They claimed that this higher ZT value for a bulk material can be attributed to the strong phonon scattering of nanodots in the bulk structure, lowering the lattice thermal conductivity, which is around or less than 0.4–0.6 W m−1 K−1 at a high temperature of 1000 K for Cu2Se. Then, the total thermal conductivity, at around 1 W m−1 K−1, leads to an enhanced TE performance.27 Almost at the same time, a ZT value of 1.6 at 700 °C was achieved for β-phase Cu2Se in a study published by Yu et al. They noted that the initial Cu2Se nanopowders obtained from high-energy ball milling are the α-phase of the tetragonal phase observed at room temperature. There was an observed phase transformation between 25 and 200 °C from the α-phase to the β-phase, which was measured using high-temperature XRD at 200, 400, and 600 °C for samples pressed at 700 °C (Fig. 7e and f). This phase transformation was reversible and the material underwent a change from the β-phase to the α-phase during the cooling process.7 Later, this ZT value of bulk Cu2−xSe was surpassed by Zhao et al. who demonstrated a new ZT value of 1.7–1.8 at 973 K.169 They reported a melt-quenched approach as a cheap and fast fabrication method. Gahtori et al. achieved a high ZT value of 2.1 for nanostructured Cu2Se, also as a result of using a high-energy ball-milling method. The lattice thermal conductivity value for a Cu2Se sample with nanodots at high temperature of 973 K was found to be 0.34 W m−1 K−1, which is around 65% lower compared to its bulk counterpart at the same temperature.54 All of the examples above demonstrate that the nanostructures of bulk TE materials allow for effective phonon scattering, followed by a reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity.170
In the second strategy, tuning the composition, including transition metal doping, building a mosaic, and hybrid compounds in NBCCs can be used to improve the TE performance. Doping can generate vacancies in material structures. At cation positions, vacancies increase the hole concentration of the system, while at anion positions, vacancies play the opposite role. Doping not only affects the transport of charge carriers (electrons and holes) but also serves as point-defect scattering sources for phonons. These impurity atoms create both force differences (strain field fluctuations) and mass contrast (mass fluctuations) between the host atoms and the impurity atoms and are very effective for scattering high-frequency (short wavelength) phonons. For example, the TE performance of Cu2Se has been further improved by doping with foreign elements (e.g. Ag, I, and Al). Brown et al. found that the temperature range resulting in an increase in phonon and electron scattering can be significantly broadened via the doping of Ag in Cu2Se.171 Liu et al. reported that iodine-doped Cu2Se with its temperature-dependent structure transition presents the highest ZT value, in excess of 2.3 near room temperature, as a result of critical scattering, which simultaneously leads to a high Seebeck coefficient and high electrical conductivity.172 The calculated energies of the transformation path demonstrate that there are no energy barriers during the phase transformation (Fig. 7g). When the sample is heated above 400 K, the low-temperature α-phase is completely transformed to a cubic β-phase (Fig. 7h).
For anion position doping, a ZT value of 2.1 has been reported in Cu2S-Cu2Te mixed bulk nanomaterials. This unique microstructure is composed of mosaic blocks with each block being a perfect crystal but tilted or rotated with respect to the others by a fraction of a minute of an arc (Fig. 7i and j).173 Before this report, the ZT of traditionally synthesized Cu2Te was as poor as 0.03 at 634 K, as observed in a study conducted by K. Kurosaki et al.,6 and approximately 0.3 at 900 K in the studies carried out by S. Ballikaya et al.174 Using a direct annealing process, Y. He et al. reported an exceptional ZT value for Cu2Te that had increased from 0.55 for the SPS sample to 1.1 for the direct annealed sample at 1000 K.175 The low TE performance might be because the phases in Cu2Te are more complex, as it undergoes five successive phase transitions before finally converting to a fcc cubic superionic phase.176
Hybrid compounds are composites consisting of two constituents at the nanometer or molecular scale that display new properties or characteristics beyond those of the matrix materials. Cu2Se and multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNTs) hybrid materials have presented a record-high TE figure of merit ZT of 2.4 at 1000 K. The special interaction between the Cu metal and CNTs is the in situ growth of Cu2Se on the surface of the CNTs leading to the fabrication of a series of Cu2Se/CNT hybrid materials, in which there is a high degree of homogeneously dispersed molecular CNTs inside the Cu2Se matrix (Fig. 7k–m).5 More recently, Zhao et al. first discovered that dual control of the phonon- and electron-transport properties can be achieved by embedding nanoparticles of a soft magnetic material in a thermoelectric matrix.177
4.2. Counter electrodes for QDSSCs
QDSSCs are a type of solar cell that use QDs as the absorbing photovoltaic material, and are a promising non-toxic upgrade from dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and a low-cost alternative to existing crystalline silicon solar cells and thin inorganic film solar cells.178,179 A QDSSC consists of four parts: a photoelectrode, QDs, an electrolyte, and a counter electrode (CE) (Fig. 8a). The photoelectrode commonly uses mesoporous oxide films such as TiO2 or ZnO film because they have a wide band gap. The QDs can be semiconductor nanocrystals such as CdS, CdSe, CdTe, CuInS2, Cu2S, PbS, PbSe, InP, InAs, Ag2S, Bi2S3, and Sb2S3 and function as a sensitizer. One outstanding advantage of QDSSCs is that the band gaps of QDs are tunable across a wide range of energy levels by controlling their size with low-cost producing methods.180 The electrolytes contain I/I3− or S2−/Sn2− redox couples. Tian et al. reported the working principle of a QDSSC. First, photons are captured by QDs. Then electron-hole pairs are rapidly separated into electrons and holes at the interface between processes employing S2−/Sn2− as the redox couple. Fig. 8b shows the details of the whole process of a working solar cell: (1) Charge transfer from an excited QD into TiO2. (2) Transport of electrons to the collecting electrode surface. (3) Hole transfer to the redox couple. (4) Regeneration of the redox couple. (5) Recombination of electrons from the QD and the oxidized form of the redox couple. And (6) Interfacial recombination of electrons from TiO2 and the oxidized form of the redox couple.181

Conventional CE materials in QDSSCs are noble metals such as Pt or Au, which are unsuitable electrocatalysts when polysulfide electrolytes are used, mainly because sulfur-containing (S2− or thiol) compounds are absorbed preferentially and strongly at Pt or Au surfaces, leading to a decrease in the surface activity and conductivity of the electrodes.10,182,183 Compared with Pt or Au CEs, copper sulfide based CEs are widely used for enhancing the conversion efficiency of QDSSCs, owing to their low resistance and high electrocatalytic activity towards redox reactions involving polysulfides.9,182 Low cost and abundant CuxS has excellent catalytic activity and good stability, which has been confirmed by examples of a CuS/CoS CE boosting the conversion efficiency of CdS/CdSe QDSSCs to 4.1% in contrast to a Pt CE (3.0%) and a CuS nano-pea film CE revealing a remarkable higher conversion efficiency of 4.01% compared to the cell containing Pt at 1.07%.183,184 Furthermore, the morphology of copper chalcogenide in assembled CEs also influences the conversion efficiency of QDSSCs. Designed hierarchical nanostructured materials for CEs can play a significant role in improving the etching process or resolving issues therein because of the enlarged solid–liquid interface, facilitated charger transport and mass transfer, and enhancement of the light trapping (Fig. 8c).185 Classified by structure, composite arrays, such as core–shell nanowire arrays with tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) nanowire cores and Cu2S nanocrystal shells (ITO@Cu2S) have been found to increase the power conversion efficiency of QDSSCs by 84.5 and 33.5% compared to those with planar Au and Cu2S CEs, respectively because of the improvement in the charge collection and transport in the NW array 3D structure (Fig. 8d–f).40 The use of a composite Cu2S film CE with interconnected nanoflakes on a fluorine-doped tin (FTO) glass substrate ensures high catalytic activity toward the polysulfide redox couple electrolyte in QDSSCs, resulting in a higher conversion efficiency of 5.21% than that of a Pt CE (1.68%) (Fig. 8g and h).186 In addition, CuS/FTO CEs fabricated with different reaction times (1, 2, and 3 h) exhibit changes in the conversion efficiency of QDSSCs. The 2 h-prepared CuS/FTO CE assembled cell displayed the highest conversion efficiency of 4.27% among the three types of CE (Fig. 8i).178 A hollow structured CE, made up of 3D-skeletal Cu7S4 nanocages, exhibited a conversion efficiency of 4.43% under 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) of irradiation in CdS/CdSe QDSSCs, higher than those of QDSSCs made with preformed 18 facet-Cu7S4 and Pt CE (Fig. 8j and k).8 All of these structures provided a higher surface area for more active catalytic sites and easy accessibility for an electrolyte, which then resulted in better performance. The electrocatalytic activity of CuxS is also composition-dependent. The tunable ratios of Cu:S influenced the electrocatalytic activity of the samples, in which the performance of the different CuxS CEs was in the order of CuS > Cu1.12S > Cu1.75S > Cu1.8S. The stability of the Cu-deficient samples is better than that of the Cu-rich counterparts in the catalytic system (Fig. 8l).187
As analogs of copper sulfide, copper selenide compounds have been expected to display similarity in this field. In recent reports, Cu1.8Se and CuxSe were also found to be chemically stable with a polysulfide electrolyte and were found to be even better than Cu2S as a CE material for QDSSCs. The power conversion efficiency is 5% and 3.8% for CdS/CdSe QDSSCs when using a Cu1.8Se and Cu2S CE, respectively (Fig. 8m).188,189 The better performance and lower cost of copper chalcogenides make them alternative CEs to the noble metal Pt and Au analogs used in QDSSCs. Chen et al. demonstrated that Cu2−xE (E = S, Se) micro/nanotubes have been used to fabricate CEs for QDSSCs, showing a higher conversion efficiency (of up to 5.02% and 6.25%, respectively) than ever reported for Au CEs.108 Moreover, these as-prepared Cu2−xSe nanotubes can be easily transformed to pure ternary CuAgSe nanotubes via a cation exchange method in a short time at room temperature. Using these designed architecture nanotubes to fabricate CEs for QDSSCs results in a better electrochemical performance and higher conversion efficiency (η = 5.61%) than for a cell containing an Au CE (η = 3.32%).63 Besides this, Cu2−xSe nanoparticles with a uniform size, when used as a CE showed superior catalytic activity and electrical conductivity, reaching an efficiency of 7.11% for a CdS/CdSe QD co-sensitized solar cell.190
4.3. Electrodes for Li/Na-ion batteries
Beyond the above two types of energy conversion in devices, the lithium-ion battery (LIB) has been applied in a broad range of energy storage devices from electronic equipment (e.g. cell phones and computers) to electric vehicles, due to their high energy density. A LIB cell contains a cathode and an anode soaked in an electrolyte solution with dissociated salts, which enable ion movement between the two electrodes (Fig. 9a).191 When the LIB cell is discharged, Li+ ions are extracted by the anode, pass through the electrolyte and are inserted into the cathode, while at the same time, electrons flow from the anode to the cathode through the external circuit. The process is reversed during charging when an external voltage is applied to the battery. Since Li+ ions shuttle between the two electrodes, the inherent properties of the electrode materials play a crucial role that determines the overall performance of batteries. Nanostructured electrode materials, particularly with a hierarchical structure, can offer improved energy storage capacity and cycling stability.192–199

In the early stage, elements such as Co and Mn were usually used as electrodes in commercialized LIBs, which are expensive for large-scale application. In order to reduce the cost, many materials with high electrical conductivity and a suitable crystal structure for lithium ion migration have been investigated and developed for LIB applications.13,73 NBCCs with high electrical conductivities and theoretical capacities have been discovered to be promising candidates when used as electrode materials for LIBs. The liquid-like Cu ions in the fcc structure of NBCCs, as mentioned previously, can provide high-speed ion mobilities and free vacancies for lithium ions to migrate into/out of the compound. In early research, the superiority of the Li/CuS cathode battery was that it had a specific volumetric energy of 470 W h dm−3 [greater than the value that can be obtained with a HgO/Zn battery (350 W h dm−3)]200 and a high specific capacity of 561 mA h g−1.201 The electrochemical curve of CuS shows two distinct voltage regions at 2.05 eV and 1.68 eV, respectively, which include two reactions. The first reaction involves the formation of LixCuS and the second reaction generates the Cu2S and Cu1.96S phases.202,203 Most recently, copper sulfides with a “copper excess”, when used as anode materials for LIBs, have shown a high rate charge–discharge capability.204 Different stoichiometric CuS compounds, such as Cu2S, Cu7S4, Cu1.96S, Cu1.85S, and CuS, led to the conclusion that a higher Cu content resulted in better cycling and rate performance capabilities, owing to the insertion/extraction of Li+ in the reaction between Cu2S and Li2S. Wang et al. proposed that coral-like CuxS I (x = 1) and CuxS II (x = 2) nanostructured electrodes showed a cycling performance and rate capability after 100 cycles (Fig. 9b and c).204 The cycling performance of CuxS I and CuxS II can be improved by coating samples on copper foil instead of aluminum foil (Fig. 9d). Tuned-structured 1D CuS and Cu2S nanorods have also been shown to exhibit good rate capability and high electrochemical stability, of 472 mA h g−1 and 313 mA h g−1, respectively at a current density of 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles (Fig. 9e and f).205 To deeply research the atomic level morphological transformations of the Cu2S nanostructures during the reaction with Li, an in situ high-resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM) was utilized. A displacement reaction mechanism occurs in Cu2S, in which the Cu metal is extruded from the crystal during the formation of a single Li2S domain. The formed Li2S particles retained the previous morphology of the Cu2S particles from the surface to inside, while the sulfur planes slightly shifted from hcp phase Cu2S to fcc phase Li2S (Fig. 9g and h).12
However, the application of CuxS in LIBs is limited by its irreversible recharging process and poor capacity retention. To avoid this disadvantage, well-designed nanostructures have been utilized due to their high transfer speed of electrons and the stability of the material structures. Numerous CuxS nanostructures, such as nanoparticles,11 nanowires,206,207 nanorods,208 flakes,209 hollow nanospheres,137 porous spheres,210 hierarchical spheres,211,212 stick-like hierarchical structures,213 and tubular dandelion-like structures,214 have been reported in terms of their electrochemical performances. For example, Cu2S nanowire arrays have been fabricated on copper substrates and used as promising cathodes for LIB, with stable lithium ion insertion/extraction reversibility, highly reversible lithium storage capacity, a long life cycle, and excellent cycling stability (Fig. 9i–k).206 Large 3D net structured CuS cathodes, composed of plenty of flakes, have been shown to exhibit a reversible capacity of 447.4 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C and good cycling stability for more than 100 cycles.209 Creating complex copper sulfides with a carbon structure is an efficient method for improving the capacity fading. A carbon matrix can serve as a bridge for electrical connection and a buffer layer for volume expansion during the process of Li insertion/extraction. Cu2S/tubular mesoporous carbon composites have been tested as cathode materials for LIBs and were found to exhibit good cycling stability (over 300 cycles) and high rate capability (225 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 10C) (Fig. 9l and m).215 This work inspired the following research, in which CuS/graphene nanocomposites were fabricated to measure their electrochemical performance or to function as anodes in LIBs. For example, CuS/graphene nanocomposites have been prepared via a simple one-pot in situ synthetic route,216,217 with the CuS/graphene hybrid structure being formed by a uniform dispersion of CuS nanoparticles on graphene nanosheets. The electrochemical performance of this CuS/graphene composite exhibits a relatively high reversible capacity and good cycling stability compared to bare CuS.217 In addition, a LIB with a CuS-RGO double sandwich-like nanostructure anode was shown to have an outstanding performance, with a first discharge capacity of up to 851 mA h g−1 and an average discharge capacity of 710.7 mA h g−1 at the 100th cycle (Fig. 9n–p).218
Copper selenides, CuSe2, CuSe, and Cu2Se thin films, have been successfully fabricated from mixed targets of Cu and Se, and also utilized as cathode materials, with capacities of 201.7 mA h g−1, 258.4 mA h g−1, and 210.2 mA h g−1, respectively. After analyzing the electrochemical reaction mechanisms and discharge products, it was noted that CuSe2 and CuSe compounds in different stoichiometries and crystal structures exhibited similar electrochemical behavior.219 Cu2−xSe-coated CuO NT arrays on a copper substrate displayed a high cycling capacity of 764 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.08 mA cm−2.220 Rod-like Cu2−xSe nanostructures exhibited an outstanding cycling performance, after 1000 cycles, and 160 mA h g−1 could be maintained with a retention of 80.3%.221 However, the capacity of Cu2−xSe/Li batteries remains unsatisfactory. Starting with the analysis of a classic superionic (SI) conductor, Cu2Se, Banerjee et al. reported that Cu2Se could be doped with Li via the process of cation exchange. Li2xCu2-2xSe alloy nanocrystals were formed at intermediate stages of the reaction, which was followed by phase segregation into Li2Se and Cu2Se domains. The Li-doped Cu2−ySe NCs and Li2Se NCs exhibited a possible SI phase at moderately elevated temperatures and warranted further ion conductance tests. These findings may guide the design of nanostructured SI electrolytes for Li+ transport.222
There have been few reports of copper telluride nanostructures used as electrodes in LIBs. Well designed Cu2−xTe materials, including nanotubes, nanosheets, and hollow nanoparticles, have been tested as anodes for LIBs. The assembled Li/LiPF6 cells present an outstanding cycling stability (up to 5000 cycles) and high specific capacity (280 mA h g−1). Among the three nanostructures, the highest capacity and best cycling performance were obtained from Cu2−xTe nanosheets, which had a capacity of 220 mA h g−1 after 120 cycles, compared to a theoretical capacity of 226.86 mA h g−1.223
Recently, sodium has replaced lithium in batteries because it is about ten times cheaper than lithium. From a commercial perspective, low cost sodium-ion batteries are more promising than current lithium ion batteries. However, because of the large ionic radius of sodium, the selected cathode materials need crystal structures with open frameworks and larger interstitial volumes to allow the movement of sodium ions. The basic electrochemical properties of Na/Cu2S rechargeable batteries have been investigated at room temperature and the results showed that they have a first discharge capacity of 294 mA h g−1, which decreases to 220 mA h g−1 after the 20th cycle.224 Stoichiometric Cu2Se has also been applied as a cathode material in sodium ion batteries and exhibited a large reversible capacity, good cycling stability, and low polarization.225
4.4. Oxygen reduction reactions
Oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) are the basic mechanisms in regenerative low-temperature fuel cells and rechargeable metal–air batteries.14,226 Between them, fuel cells can convert chemical potential energy (stored in molecular bonds) into electrical energy. Compared to conventional technologies such as internal combustion engines, they enhance conversion efficiency (from ∼35% to 50%–60%). So they are attractive for a variety of applications ranging from portable technology to automotives to stationary power.22 At the current stage, recyclable gases such as hydrogen gas (H2) and oxygen gas (O2), have been used as fuels in proton exchange membrane (PEM) cells. The products after the reaction in the cell are electricity and heat, and the by-product is non-toxic water. In a PEM fuel cell, the anode, cathode, electrolyte, and catalyst are the four basic components (Fig. 10a). Among these four components, the catalyst is the most essential part of the fuel cell, which is usually made up of a very thin layer of Pt nanoparticles coated on a soft conductive substrate (i.e. carbon paper or cloth), which is rough and porous so that the maximum surface area of the Pt can be exposed to the hydrogen or oxygen.

One strategy for promoting the utilization of fuel cells and decreasing the cost of production is exploring and synthesizing non-Pt electrocatalysts. Mostly transition metal oxides and some chalcogenides have been used in this application due to their good stabilities in alkaline media. Among them, NBCCs show comparable properties and optimized catalytic activity by modifying the compositions of electrodes. For example, non-stoichiometric CuxSy-nanoporous carbon composites for ORR were shown to be a good performance oxygen reduction catalyst in alkaline media and it was demonstrated that this material can outperform Pt in terms of current density and stability. The advantage of small pores with a hydrophobic surface governed by the presence of copper sulfides and sulfur in C–S–C configurations attract oxygen molecules from the electrolyte (Fig. 10b–e).227 Cu-Deficient plasmonic Cu2−xS nanoplates have also been used as electrocatalysts for ORR. When supported on reduced graphene oxide, an increased activity was achieved, compared to Cu2−xS nanoplates alone, owing to the high electrical conductivity between the Cu2−xS and graphene. Non-stoichiometric compounds present a better performance because of the increased ORR activity, depending on the increase in the concentration of free holes (Fig. 10f–h).116 Besides this, there is a bottleneck in the water-splitting process of OER. This is because “the transfer rate of the electrons involved is slow and the activation energy barrier for O–O bond formation is high, requiring over potential in substantial excess of its thermodynamic potential”. Generally, Ir- and Ru-based catalysts are used for this reaction. Alternative Cu complexes have also been tried due to their vacancies within the lattice. In this sense, p-type CuS and Cu2S have been observed to undergo a phase transformation during the reduction process. Through an optimizing of the conditions, Cu2S nanoplates have outperformed CuS nanoplates in applications. The results demonstrated that the addition of glycine promoted the performance to reach activities and durabilities close to those of state-of-the-art commercial Ir/C catalysts (Fig. 10i–k).228
Cu2Se nanostructures are also expected to possess good electrocatalytic activity towards ORR because of the mixture of Cu+ and Cu2+ valences and the good ORR catalytic performance of some Cu-based nanostructures (e.g. Cu3N nanocubes15 and Cu2O nanocrystals229) in alkaline electrolyte. A recent report has demonstrated that the catalytic activity and stability of tetragonal phase Cu2Se NWs are better than those of the cubic phase. Moreover, this catalytic performance of tetragonal phase Cu2Se NWs is comparable to or better than those of commercial Pd/C and some other recently reported non-Pt electrocatalysts. This work also explored how phase structure can influence ORR performance.106
4.5. Photothermal therapy
PT therapy involves the large absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the NIR region (650–950 nm) for the treatment of various medical conditions, including the hyperthermic destruction of tumor cells. Skin, blood, and tissue weakly absorb NIR radiation, so NIR light can penetrate them without causing much damage to normal tissues while treating specific cells.17 From a treatment point of view, a good PT agent should have a strong absorption peak in the NIR region and could convert laser energy to heat efficiently. The selection of PT agents is based on the principle of LSPRs in materials. The strong absorption peak in the NIR region results from collective electron charge oscillations in specific nanoparticles that are excited by light. For bio-safety, these good PT agents should have high biocompatibility, good photostability, and also have easy renal dispersibility.18,230–232 Nanostructures are suitable as PT agents for targeting tumor cells because they have the abovementioned special properties. Commonly used PT agents are Au nanostructures, organic compounds, carbon-based materials and semiconductor nanostructures. Among them, Au compounds with different shapes and sizes have been explored the most.233–237 However, they have limitations for use in therapeutic applications, such as inherent high cost and not being biodegradable.23
Designed NBCCs, with particular optical properties, have been explored for PT therapy in recent years. Their optical features can be tuned by nanocrystal size, shape, and surface, which should be carefully designed for different working NIR absorption peaks. Modification of these factors can influence the functionality of nanostructures. An efficient method to enhance PT efficiency is via the construction of superstructures.238 A smaller size of nanocrystals can achieve a wider range of absorption peaks. As an example, Au nanoparticles have been reduced to 25 nm to obtain an absorption peak of around 800 nm, while smaller 3 nm CuS nanoparticles have been used to achieve an optical absorption peak at 900 nm. The absorption in CuS nanoparticles is due to the d–d transition of Cu2+, which differs from the surface plasmon resonance observed in Au nanoparticles.69 In fact, CuS has a large energy gap and broader absorption peaks, which allows for more selection in the laser light used.237 In addition, in order to reduce the damage induced to the surrounding tissue, the energy dose of the laser light should be decreased. The optical characteristics of CuS nanoparticles allow them working as PT agents in this energy dose decreased condition. This is all possible using smaller CuS nanoparticles, which are capable of larger renal clearance and cost less, in comparison to Au nanoparticles.23 Specifically, CuS nanoparticles, under irradiation from a NIR laser beam at 808 nm, have been shown to induce the PT destruction of human cervical cancer HeLa cells in a laser dose- and nanoparticle concentration-dependent manner, while displaying minimal toxic effects, with a profile similar to that of Au nanoparticles.69 Other than nanoparticles, hydrophilic flower-like CuS superstructures have been shown to exhibit a higher NIR PT conversion efficiency (of approximately 50%) compared with their corresponding building blocks (hexagonal nanoplates) (Fig. 11a). It was found that cancer cells wrapped in chicken skin or in vivo can be efficiently terminated by the PT effects of CuS superstructures under the irradiation of a 980 nm laser with a safe power density over a short period of 5–10 min (Fig. 11b and c).135 Subsequent reports on various superstructures of copper sulfides, such as honeycomb-like mesoporous nanospheres,239 shuttle-like bundles,240 nanoplates,241 hollow nanostructures,242 and superlattices16 have similarly demonstrated the optical advantages of assembled structures. For example, CuS mesostructure assembled honeycomb-like mesoporous nanospheres with a high specific surface area have a high PT conversion efficiency. Under 980 nm laser irradiation, the CuS mesostructures are heated for a short time and then kill cancer cells in vitro (Fig. 11d and e).239 Self-assembled CuS shuttle-like bundles, greatly influence the electronic structures of indirect transitions, exhibiting a molar extinction coefficient of 9.7 × 1016 cm−1 M−1 and a PT transduction efficiency of over 70% at 980 nm.240

Another strategy for improving PT conversion efficiency is to modify the nanocrystal composition, which can be achieved by varying the Cu to S ratio,243 or by exploring other Cu chalcogenide compositions or hybrid compounds.244 With respect to different Cu to S ratio compounds, uniform Cu1.94S hexagonal nanoplates have shown absorption signals over a wide range, from the UV to NIR, which allows for optical phase changes and is applicable to PT.239 In terms of compounds with other stoichiometries, a Cu7S4 hollow structure with a different shell thickness and shape have been shown to exhibit a strong optical absorption at 635 nm.242 Cui et al. compared the PT conversion efficiency of Cu7S4 nanoparticles, rod-like alignments, and nanosuperlattices upon irradiation with an 808 nm laser, and observed that nanoparticles (48.62%) and rod-like alignments (56.32%) showed a lower PT conversion efficiency compared with that of nanosuperlattices (65.7%).16 They also predicted the LSPR features of self-assembled Cu7S4 nanocrystals via electromagnetic simulation at 808 nm using finite difference time domain (FDTD) solutions (Fig. 11f). The 2D contour of the electron field intensity (XOY-plane, z = 0 nm) indicated a very weak LSPR feature around a single Cu7S4 nanocrystal, whereas an obvious enhancement in the electron field around both the rod-like alignments and nanosuperlattices of the Cu7S4 nanocrystals was observed. Among them, the LSPR feature of nanosuperlattices is far stronger than those of dispersed nanoparticles and rod-like alignments, which is highly desirable for a better PT conversion efficiency. In the above examples, the enhancement in the photo-absorption could be tuned if the nanocrystals are aligned with photonic-crystal microstructures, and if the faceted-end planes of well-shaped crystals serve as good laser-cavity mirrors.245 The cavity-mirror effect was also observed in hollow CuInS2 microspheres, which exhibited PT conversion.246 Regarding other Cu chalcogenide compositions, such as Cu2−xSe86 and Cu2−xTe,31 Cu2−xSe nanocrystals excited by NIR light at 800 nm led to significant human colorectal cancer cell death, which demonstrated that Cu2−xSe nanocrystals have a similar PT transduction efficiency to that of CuS. This was first reported by Hessel et al., who demonstrated that nanostructures showed marked photo-induced heating when excited by NIR light and a similar transduction efficiency, compared to that of Au nanorods and nanoshells (Fig. 11g).86 Highly uniform CuTe nanocubes, nanoplates, and nanorods also showed a strong plasmonic peak at 900 nm, which indicated the potential use of these materials as SERS probes and in PT.31
5. Conclusions
Over the past few decades, numerous structure-oriented synthetic methods for NBCCs have been developed and used in energy-related and biological applications. In this review, we briefly presented the historical development of binary copper chalcogenides by dividing it into three important stages. We classified typical synthesic strategies for NBCCs from 0D to 3D in terms of stoichiometry and non-stoichiometry, and related these specific nanostructures to the improved performance in thermoelectric, photovoltaic, energy storage, catalytic, and biological applications. Design of nanostructures and tuning of the stoichiometry are two main strategies for the improvement of the properties of NBCCs. Despite these advanced strategies, the synthetic strategies and common applications of NBCCs are still in the early stages. There are several challenges that need to be overcome in order to drive further development.
From a synthetic viewpoint, precise control and manipulation of NBCCs with various stoichiometries still remains challenging. 0D NBCCs can be easily obtained using colloidal synthesis methods, which are highly structure controlled processes, but it is hard to boost the yield of NBCCs for use in further practical applications. 1D and 3D NBCCs rely more on template-directed synthesis methods, nanoscale Kirkendall effect-induced methods, and cation exchange synthesis methods. These methods require a complicated fabrication process and are costly. In contrast, 2D NBCCs are preferentially grown by solvothermal/hydrothermal methods, which can be scaled up in one step, however, the crystallinity and morphology of NBCCs are hard to manipulate. A combination of the above methods is needed for the synthesis of some specific NBCCs, whereby desired nanostructures and tuned stoichiometry can be achieved.
Besides this, the synthetic methods of NBCCs can also be used to develop fabrication methods for other transition-metal binary to quaternary chalcogenides. In particular, template-directed synthesis and cation exchange synthesis methods hold potential for the further synthesis of uniform nanostructures. Simple copper sulfide nanocrystals could be applied to selectively design and prepare a number of novel transition-metal chalcogenide structures and compounds, which include pure hollow/porous/core–shell architectures and hybrid or partially-exchanged compositions.
For energy-related and biological applications, the contribution of designed NBCCs and tuned stoichiometries toward enhancing performance have not been comprehensively and thoroughly investigated. Specifically, NBCCs have attracted extensive attention as promising TE materials due to their low cost, abundance, and low toxicity. To enhance performance, TE materials require enhanced phonon scattering and diminished thermal conductivity, which can be achieved by designing nanostructures in bulk materials and tuning the compositions of NBCCs to some extent. Even though many studies have evidently demonstrated that NBCCs in bulk materials have already improved TE performance, the second strategy, tuning of the composition, has not yet been thoroughly researched. It is therefore expected that the building of hybrid NBCC compounds will attract more attention in the future.
Overall, the mechanism and phenomenon of the interconnection between the nanostructures and physical properties of NBCCs remain unexplained. Further research is needed on high efficiency and low-cost synthetic strategies to enable these materials to be used further in applications such as energy conversion and biological devices. It is hoped that NBCCs, with their simple composition, low cost, and low toxicity, will be widely applied in more energy-related and biological applications.
