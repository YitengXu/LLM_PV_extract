    , Accepted 22nd February 2017First published on 23rd February 2017AbstractDespite being the most commonly used hole transport layer for p-i-n perovskite solar cells, the conventional PEDOT:PSS layer is far from being optimal for the best photovoltaic performance. Herein, we demonstrate highly conductive thin DMSO-doped PEDOT:PSS layers which significantly enhance the light harvesting, charge extraction, and photocurrent production of organo-lead iodide devices. Both imaging and X-ray analysis reveal that the perovskite thin films grown on DMSO-doped PEDOT:PSS exhibit larger grains with increased crystallinity. Altogether, these improvements result in a 37% boost in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to standard p-i-n photovoltaics with pristine PEDOT:PSS. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DMSO-doped PEDOT:PSS devices possess enhanced PCE durability over time which we attribute primarily to fill factor stability.
1. Introduction
Recently, methylammonium lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention due to their excellent advantages of broad light absorption from the visible to the near-infrared region, easy solution processability, extremely long ambipolar carrier diffusion lengths, and high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).1,2 The highest PCE record of perovskite solar cells has rapidly increased from 3.1% to over 21%3–9 in the past 7 years. However, given that the theoretical efficiency limit for perovskite solar cells is estimated to be 31.4%,10–12 there is still room for improvement if the major hurdles are addressed.
The role of the hole transport layer (HTL) is vital to reducing interfacial recombination and effectively extracting charge carriers from the perovskite active layer to the corresponding electrodes.13–15 At present, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is one of the most popular hole transport materials used to construct p-i-n type PSCs.16,17 However, many reports have found that conventional PEDOT:PSS is flawed in many ways.18–22 Electrically, charge transport within the PEDOT:PSS layer is inefficient because of low conductivity.18 Inefficient hole transport could create an unbalanced carrier transport, resulting in charge accumulation at the interface that in turn reduces the shunt resistance and increases the leakage current.23,24 Surprisingly, until now, the aforementioned problems of conventional PEDOT:PSS in PSC have rarely been addressed.1,25 Nevertheless, ample scientific studies on organic solar cells (OSCs) can shed light on finding a solution to this problem.
Polar organic solvents like dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),26,27N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF),28 ethylene glycol (EG),26 and sorbitol29,30 can be used as an additive to further improve the PEDOT:PSS morphology and increase the conductivity of a PEDOT:PSS film by 2–3 orders of magnitude. Out of these small molecules considered, we selected DMSO for this study because it exhibits distinctive advantages as it has the most superior dipole moment, dielectric constant, and relatively high boiling point.26–28 These properties allow strong dipole–dipole or dipole–charge interactions to form between the PEDOT:PSS and DMSO, and can lead to enhanced charge-carrier mobility.31 In addition, DMSO can alter the morphology and work function of PEDOT:PSS, and thereby reduce the barrier for charge transfer.32 We note that DMSO has previously been reported to enhance the PEDOT:PSS properties for hybrid and polymer solar cell systems.26,27 For example, Hu et al.32 reported a correlation between the OSC device characteristics and the morphology and work function of DMSO treated PEDOT:PSS. Recently, Adam et al.33 utilized DMSO and the Zonyl FS-300 fluoro-surfactant in thick conductive (∼130 nm) PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH1000) to improve the quality of the perovskite layer. Despite these recent studies performed, the strong and evident correlations between the properties of hole transport PEDOT:PSS and PSC characteristics have not been fully established.
Here, we show that DMSO treated PEDOT:PSS with enhanced electrical, optical, and morphological properties can significantly increase the photocurrent and efficiency of p-i-n type PSCs. The DMSO-doped PEDOT:PSS HTL provides an efficient pathway for the hole extraction, transport, and collection from the perovskite active layer to the ITO anode. Furthermore, it also modulates the growth of perovskite crystals to improve the morphology and crystallinity of planar perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) solar cells. Altogether, these improvements result in a PCE of 16.7%, which is a 37% increase from our control device using pristine PEDOT:PSS.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Fabrication of solar cells
Indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates with a resistance of ∼15 Ω per square were cleaned with a detergent and ultrasonicated in acetone and deionized water, followed by ethanol. The cleaned ITO substrates were dried with nitrogen gas and kept for 15 minutes in a Petri dish before UV-ozone treatment to increase the ITO work function. Different volume ratios of DMSO (5, 10, and 15 vol%) were added into the aqueous based PEDOT:PSS directly obtained from Clevios Al 4083. Then, the resultant solutions are magnetically stirred for over 12 h at room temperature and filtered through polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filters (0.45 μm) prior to thin film fabrication. The HTL thin films were spin-coated and thermally annealed at 150 °C for 30 min under an ambient atmosphere. The precursor solution of CH3NH3PbI3 was composed of PbI2 and CH3NH3I with a molar ratio of 1:1 and was stirred in a mixture of DMSO:γ-butyrolactone (GBL) (3:7, v/v) at 60 °C for 12 h. The substrates were transferred into a N2-filled glove box, where 1.4 mol CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution was applied onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates by two consecutive spin-coating steps at 2000 and 4000 rpm for 20 and 60 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step, 400 μL chlorobenzene (CB) is quickly dripped onto the rotating substrate. After drying the substrate at 100 °C for 5 min, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) solution (30 mg mL−1 in CB) was deposited onto the perovskite film. Finally, 8 nm of bathocuproine (BCP, Luminescence Technology Corp.) and 100 nm of Ag were thermally evaporated at ∼10−7 torr to form the contact electrodes.
2.2. Photovoltaic characterization
After fabrication, the devices were illuminated under a standard 100 mW cm−2 simulated light source with AM 1.5G filters (ABET Technologies). The illumination intensity was calibrated with a quartz windowed Newport calibrated Si solar cell. The active area of the device irradiated with the light was 1.8 mm2 by using a photomask, so no extra current outside of the defined area was collected. Current density–voltage (J–V) data were acquired via a Keithley 2400 source meter. The absorption and transmission spectra of dried films were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-3101 PC spectrometer. EQE measurements were performed in a glove box with a silicon cell calibrated QEPVSI system (Newport) under zero bias. Impedance spectroscopy was performed via a BioLogic VMP3 multichannel potentiostat. UPS measurements were carried out on a PHI VersaProbe II to determine the work function of the materials, and a He discharge lamp, emitting ultraviolet energy at 21.22 eV, was used for excitation. All UPS measurements of the onset of photoemission to determine the work function were performed using standard procedures with a −5 V bias applied to the samples. AFM measurements were conducted with a Bruker Dimension Fastscan model in tapping mode with reflective probes resonating at 150 kHz frequency. SEM images were obtained by using a field emission Hitachi SU-70 unit. Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) data were obtained at beamline 1W1A, Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF), using a Si (111) double crystal monochromator and a photon energy of 8 keV with an incident angle of 0.2°, where Q = 4πsinθ/λ, θ is a half of the total scattering angle, and λ is the X-ray wavelength (0.15476 nm).
3. Results and discussion
We show the doping of DMSO into PEDOT:PSS by mixing the as-received PEDOT:PSS with various volume ratios of DMSO (5, 10, and 15 vol%). According to the photovoltaic performance (Fig. S1 and Table S1†), the doping level of the highest PCE is 10 vol% of DMSO. To further investigate the mechanism responsible for the enhanced performance of the PSCs with DMSO treatment to the PEDOT:PSS, the superior doping ratio of 10 vol% is used. A control CH3NH3PbI3-based PSC device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/BCP/Ag is also employed in the studies (Fig. 1a).

Both forward (from −1.3 to 1.3 V) and backward scans (from 1.3 to −1.3 V) were measured at a rate of 22 mV s−1. 
For the convenience of discussion, different films and devices are named and prepared to compare their performances:
Film 1: PEDOT:PSS
Film 2: PEDOT:PSS:DMSO = 9:1, by the volume ratio
Control: ITO/Film 1/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM /BCP/Ag
DMSO-device: ITO/Film 2/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/BCP/Ag
We show the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of solar cells with and without the DMSO treatment while the best and average photovoltaic parameters including Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE (Fig. 1c and Table 1). On average, the control device performs like a typical perovskite solar cell, attaining a PCE of 11.8%. As the HTL is doped with DMSO, we observe a significant increase in the photovoltaic performance up to 15.8%. Our champion DMSO-device operates at a PEC of 16.7%, with a Jsc of 22.76 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.92 V, and a FF of 80%. Compared to the control, we observe an increase in the photocurrent generation which accounts for significant improvement in the Jsc from 16.62 mA cm−2 to 22.76 mA cm−2. As a result the best PCE for our control device is 12.7% which is below the record (21.1%) PCE for record perovskite devices up-to-date.7 To be fair, we note that a direct comparison to perovskite solar cells based on PEDOT:PSS (without optimization) reveals that our control cells show performance comparable to the results reported by the J. Huang group (12.3%)34 as well as many others (12–14%).35–37 It is known that the leakage current is determined by the shunt resistance (Rsh), and the turn on current is influenced by the series resistance (Rs).38,39 The larger Rsh indicates a lower charge carrier recombination in the active layer, meanwhile the smaller Rs signifies a lower resistance of the semiconductor bulk resistance and a better metal/semiconductor interface induced by adding DMSO into PEDOT:PSS.40 In addition, we show that the variations in Rs values for different DMSO doping ratios are in good agreement with the trend reported in the literature for OPV32 and correlate with the PCE results (Table S1†). We observe that the lowest Rs is obtained at the optimum (10%) doping ratio and as the DMSO concentration increases, the Rs value rises from 1.6 to 2.9 Ω cm2 and thus results in a PCE reduction from 16.7% to 14.3%. Furthermore, we demonstrate more efficient PL quenching in Film 2 than in Film 1 (Fig. S3a†). This implies that the charge transfer between the perovskite and DMSO-treated PEDOS:PSS is more efficient, compared to that between the perovskite and the non-treated PEDOT:PSS.

To investigate the main factors responsible for the improved Jsc, we conduct the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements to resolve the contribution of photocurrent collection to the incoming photon energy. Overall, we observe that the EQE spectra illustrate a substantial improvement (consistent with the portion of the Jsc increment) across the entire visible to near infra-red region when the DMSO-HTL was applied (Fig. 2a). We ascribe the enhancement in the 350 to 550 nm range to the stronger absorption of the CH3NH3PbI3 on Film 2 (Fig. 2b). Since the perovskite active layer is identical in terms of the preparation process, e.g. spin-coating conditions, annealing temperature, and thickness, we suggest that the difference in absorption can be attributed to the HTL optical properties. Indeed, the transmission spectra of the HTLs confirm that the DMSO treated Film 2 appears to be more translucent than the conventional PEDOT:PSS (Fig. S3†). The superior transparency granted by Film 2 at the lower bound of visible wavelength contributes to a greater extent of photon harvesting in PSCs.

On the other hand, the EQE enhancement in the 550–800 nm range cannot be solely explained by contribution from absorption. In fact, the average EQE in this segment of the spectra has increased substantially from 65.9% for control to 87.3% of DMSO-device as a result of the DMSO modification (Fig. 2a). To identify other causal factors, we inspect the morphology of the CH3NH3PbI3 films on Film 1 and Film 2 using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). The root-mean square (RMS) surface roughness increases from 1.2 nm (Fig. 3a) to 3.6 nm after adaptation of DMSO in the HTL films (Fig. 3b). The coarse topology of DMSO added PEDOT:PSS has been ascribed to the formation of desirable PEDOT-rich bead-like aggregates, which are more conductive and favor hole transport at the interface (Fig. 3b).26,32,41 Furthermore, the moderately rough interface can be beneficial towards improving the actual contact area between the HTL and the active layer in OSCs.42–44 Therefore, the nanoscale roughening induced by DMSO enables Film 2 to become more efficient for charge injection across the interlayer. More importantly, we reveal that the DMSO in the HTL exerts a strong impact on the morphology of the perovskite layer cast on top. Typically, spin-coated perovskite films are known to exhibit very rough textures that cause problematic pinhole related issues.45–47 We observe that the overall RMS roughness of the DMSO contained CH3NH3PbI3/Film 2 decreases immensely from 11.2 nm (control CH3NH3PbI3/Film 1) to 6.2 nm (Fig. 3c and d). As the CH3NH3PbI3 layer becomes flatter, the conformal ultrathin electron transport layer can be applied effectively to prevent direct contact between the absorber and the metal contact therefore reducing small shorting spots.48,49

We compare the average grain size of CH3NH3PbI3 on Film 1 and Film 2 using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The average CH3NH3PbI3 grain formation on Film 1 and Film 2 (out of 3 random SEM snapshots) is ca. 160 and 190 nm, respectively (Fig. 4c and d). Using Nano Measurer software,50 we assess the maximum grain size of CH3NH3PbI3 on Film 1 and Film 2 to be ca. 370 and 450 nm, respectively. The enlargement of the perovskite domains implies fewer grain boundaries, which correlate with a lower trap density formed in the PSCs51 Thus, the lower number of trap states explains why Film 2 is more efficient in alleviating loss due to recombination, which is prominent in semi-crystalline photovoltaics like PSCs.52 Although the origin of the Voc is still under debate, there are two major contributors that are usually identified for Voc formation: (i) the work function of both sides of the active layer and (ii) the trap density and recombination in the active layer.53–56 For the former, we show the work function of the PEDOT:PSS layers with and without DMSO treatment using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. 1b). The work function values are 4.99 and 4.86 eV for 0 and 10 vol% DMSO treated PEDOT:PSS films, respectively.21,57 However, despite the slight drop in the work function, changes in the Voc are not observed for the perovskite solar cells. We attribute this near constant Voc observation to the reduction in the trap density and recombination in the perovskite layer.54,55,58 As shown in the SEM images, the average domain size of the perovskite layer (Film 2) is larger than that of the control (Film 1). As A. Giuri et al. reported,59 a bigger domain size of the perovskite layer reduces the trap density and recombination event in the layer, leading to an increase in Voc of perovskite solar cells. Therefore, Voc might stay unchanged because reductions in trap density and recombination events could compensate for the Voc loss originating from the reduction in work function.

To establish the correlation between improved morphology and enhanced Jsc, we employ synchrotron-based grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to probe the internal nanostructure of the perovskite films grown on different HTLs.60 The presence of strong scattering rings in both films indicates that the perovskite layers are predominantly polycrystalline (Fig. 5). However, the perovskite film on Film 2 exhibits stronger anisotropic signals at q = 1 Å−1 and 2 Å−1 which correspond to the (110) and (220) crystal orientations of CH3NH3PbI3.49,61 We plot the azimuthally integrated scattering intensity against the out-of-plane scattering vector qz (Fig. 5c) and notice the absence of the PbI2 (001) scattering peak at q = 0.9 Å −1. This indicates a complete conversion of the insulating PbI2 into semiconducting CH3NH3PbI3.62 The greater CH3NH3PbI3 scattering signals of the (110), (220) and (330) diffraction intensities obtained by Film 2 infer that the perovskite granules are packed in higher crystallinity. As presented by Li et al.,60 the morphology and crystallization of perovskite active films are sensitive to the growth kinetics. Seed-mediated growth induced by nanoparticle scaffolds has been widely adopted to control the coating process in order to produce higher crystalline films.33,63,64 For this work, we note that the aggregated PEDOT-rich particles are enriched on the surface of Film 2 (Fig. 3b). We propose that the PEDOT-rich particles can act as growing sites for the crystal nucleus of CH3NH3PbI3 films during annealing. The intense out-of-plane (110) diffraction peaks of the perovskite film on Film 2 are at qz = 1.046 Å−1, corresponding to the d spacing of 6.00 Å, whereas for CH3NH3PbI3 on Film 1, the qz sets at 1.039 Å−1 (d = 6.04 Å). These phenomena of higher crystallinity and closer packing of CH3NH3PbI3 on Film 2 account for more efficient pathways with a lower resistance to facilitate charge carrier transport to the electrodes.65 Moreover, we show that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) varies between the different perovskite films (Table S2†). In general, the perovskite layer grown on Film 2 demonstrates a narrower FWHM than the control, indicating better film crystallinity and larger grain size in accordance with the Debye–Scherrer equation. These results are in agreement with the observations attained from the SEM images, revealing that the Film 2 favors the formation of a larger grain perovskite layer.

Reportedly, DMSO can drastically change the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS, which can also account for the Jsc increase.32 We measure the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of simple cells consisting of ITO/{Film 1, or Film 2, or CH3NH3PbI3, or PCBM}/Au to calculate the conductivity of the active films (Fig. S5a†). The direct current conductivity (σ0) is determined from the slope of the I–V plot.66,67I = σ0Ad−1Vwhere A is the sample area and d is the sample film thickness. The thicknesses of PEDOT:PSS, DMSO-doped PEDOT:PSS, CH3NH3PbI3 and PCBM are ∼47 nm, ∼41 nm, ∼450 nm and ∼60 nm, respectively as measured by using an alpha-step 200 profilometer. We evaluate the σ0 values for Film 1, Film 2, CH3NH3PbI3 and PCBM to be ∼0.0034, ∼0.0036, ∼0.0068, and ∼0.0041 mS cm−1, respectively. Therefore, it can be expected that the generated carriers from the CH3NH3PbI3 layer are more efficiently transported to Film 2 than Film 1.66,67 In addition, impedance spectroscopy has also served as an effective tool to provide insight into the charge transport process.68 We show the impedance Nyquist plots Film 1 and Film 2 (sandwiched between ITO and Ag electrodes) scanned from 1 MHz to 0.5 Hz (Fig. S5b†). The shrinkage of the semi-circle in the Nyquist diagram for Film 2 is a direct implication that the DMSO incorporation has successfully reduced the interlayer impedance or increased its conductivity. Moreover, the smaller semi-circle indicates that the holes are efficiently transported and less energy is lost during the hole transport process in the PSCs incorporated with the DMSO-doped PEDOT:PSS HTL.37 Therefore, the high Jsc and high PCEs are observed for the DMSO-device.
For long-term device applications, the hygroscopic and acidic characteristics of the PEDOT:PSS are regarded as the main culprits for rapid degradation in the solar cells. To find out whether DMSO can mitigate these negative effects, we reveal device stability measurements of our devices for more than a month (Fig. 6). All of the devices were stored in a N2 glove box without encapsulation and device performances were periodically measured under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 illumination. The recorded device performances are averaged over four different cells. We observe that the degradation rate of the PCE for DMSO-device is significantly slower than that for the control. We illustrate that the control deteriorates drastically in terms of Jsc, FF and PCE, slashing the PCE into half after 590 hours (Fig. 6). Comparatively, at the same storage duration of 590 hours, the PCE of DMSO-device still retains ∼83% of the initial value. Moreover, after 1162 hours, DMSO-device's efficiency only drops by 23%, namely from 16.1% to 12.4% (Fig. S6†); however, the control's PCE plummets by 83.5%, operating at only 2.1% (from 12.7%). To this end, we demonstrate that DMSO enhances not only the performance but also the device stabilities. In other words, incorporation of DMSO into the HTL can help stabilize the photovoltaic characteristics of CH3NH3PbI3 films. We attribute the prolonged durability to reduced acidity and moisture captured in the HTL.69 In addition, it is worth mentioning that the efficiency degradation also stems from the deterioration of FF in the control cell (Fig. 6c).4,70,71 Fascinatingly, this problem can be rectified by our approach as the DMSO-device shows remarkable stability of the FF over the entire continual 1162 hours testing period. Our results affirm that Film 2 is more practical than Film 1 for the applications of HTL on ITO substrates.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrate an outstanding enhancement (about 37% boost in device power conversion efficiency) of p-i-n planar PSCs by using a more efficient HTL. The PSCs with a DMSO treated HTL show greater photocurrent generation and longevity. We attribute the improvements to absorption, morphology, crystallinity, conductivity, and suppressed interfacial recombination. This work highlights the potential of DMSO-doped PEDOT:PSS as an efficient HTL in PSCs, which also provides an efficient way to improve the device performance of p-i-n PSCs.
