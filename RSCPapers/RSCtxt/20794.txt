    , Accepted 2nd September 2022First published on 5th September 2022AbstractCdTe, widely used in radiation detectors, optoelectronics and photovoltaics, is a typical II–VI semiconductor with covalent and ionic bonds where various defects are easily induced and their physical properties are well documented. However, development of electronic and photoelectronic devices with deep defect states is still absent. Here, CdTe thin films with diverse defect levels are purposely grown through a van der Waals epitaxy (vdWE) mode by molecular beam epitaxy. A water-assisted method is developed to exfoliate and transfer the vdWE CdTe to fabricate field effect phototransistors. Large-area CdTe thin films of hundreds of microns and with a well-defined crystalline structure can be transferred. The on/off ratio of 39 and mobility of 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 reach optimal values in the achieved CdTe. Besides the improved sensitivity by gate modulation, for the first time, the spectral response region can be extended to 1.65 μm far beyond the cutoff wavelength of 870 nm. In the whole extended region, ultrahigh responsivity and detectivity above 3.84 A W−1 and 3.73 × 1011 Jones, respectively, are yielded, which are comparable or superior to those of Si, Ge, GaP and InGaAs photodetectors. These outstanding electrical and optoelectronic properties illustrate a strong competitiveness with these commercial detectors. A possible mechanism of the spectrum expansion by a gate is detailed and attributed to the photogating dominated response under an external field.
1 Introduction
Cadmium telluride (CdTe) is the ideal material of choice for room temperature (RT) radiation detectors1 and an ideal substrate to epitaxially grow Hg1−xCdxTe (MCT) infrared photodetector materials2 covering the whole infrared band from the near infrared (NIR) to the very long-wavelength infrared (VLWIR) region by tuning x. Besides, CdTe is widely used in optoelectronics and photovoltaics due to its ultrahigh absorption coefficient beyond 105 cm−1 and near-optimum direct energy bandgap of 1.5 eV at RT.3,4 Therefore, an ultrahigh responsivity of 780 A W−1 is realized in a nanoribbon CdTe field effect transistor (FET) photodetector.3 A conversion efficiency of 17% and open-circuit voltage of over 1 V are achieved in CdTe film solar cells.4 Moreover, novel physics phenomena such as the two-dimensional (2D) electron gas and quantum Hall effect are observed at a well-defined interface of PbTe/CdTe and HgTe/CdTe heterostructures,5,6 showing great potential in high-electron-mobility transistors and spintronics. Recently, the van der Waals epitaxy (vdWE) technique of covalence-bonded semiconductors on 2D layered materials has been developed owing to the lack of strict lattice-matching requirements between the epitaxial layer and the substrate, and exfoliation and transfer of the epitaxial layer onto a desired substrate to satisfy the requirements of heterogeneous integration of electronic and optoelectronic devices.7–10 Recently, although CdTe nanowire arrays, nanosheets and thin films have been grown by the vdWE route,8–10 exfoliation and transfer of the vdWE layers, and especially developments of the electronics and optoelectronics devices are not well documented.
Multiple detection mechanisms are developed and different device structures are designed to optimize photodetector performance.11 Photocurrent generation is from electron–hole (e–h) separation or the thermal effect. Photoconductors, phototransistors, photodiodes, photothermal bolometers and thermopiles are the most studied devices. Based on e–h separation, besides the photoconduction effect, the photogating effect is put forward to shed light on a broader spectral detection range, more excellent performance and RT infrared detection of low dimensional materials with remarkable photoresponse for critical applications, which are usually reported in defects/impurity materials or artificial hybrid structures.11–14 The photogating effect means that the photogenerated holes or electrons are trapped in the localized states and act as a local gate, which produces an additional electric field and modulates the electrical conductance of the channel.12 However, these impurities and defects possibly act as trap centers instead of recombination centers greatly prolonging the minority lifetime. Hence, many detectors dominated by photogating prefer to obtain a considerable photoelectric gain at the cost of response speed.11 Recently, the concept of photovoltage FETs has been put forward, availing high gain and high bandwidth simultaneously.15 CdTe is a typical II–VI semiconductor with covalent bonding and strong ionic bonding, which is apt to induce diverse defects including Te/Cd vacancies, interstitial atoms, antisite defects, defect complexes etc.16 Accordingly, complex defect centers such as shallow donor and acceptor levels, donor–acceptor pairs and deep defect states are found in CdTe.16,17 The physics and minority lifetime related to these defects have been well clarified.18,19 The carrier lifetime is closely related to the type of energy band, defects and impurities states.19,20 Shallow levels with direct recombination would lead to a shorter carrier lifetime while the deep ones delay the recombination of excess carriers and thus a longer lifetime is observed in CdTe.18–20 Photodetectors with extrinsic defect states, such as Au or As doped Si, and Ga doped Ge, have been developed to extend the photodetection range.21,22 However, despite deep studies on the physics correlated with the defects of CdTe, electronic and optoelectronic devices with these phenomena especially deep defect states have been seldom developed to date. The deep defect levels at around 0.7–0.8 eV and 1.1–1.3 eV may extend the spectral response region to long-wave near infrared (LWNIR), i.e. the spectral range can be extended to 1.8 μm, which plays a crucial role for application in the optical fiber communication wavelength region from 1.3 μm to 1.65 μm,23–25 imaging applications in the LWNIR region where the natural phenomena known as air glow or night glow with a faint light around 1.25 μm and 1.6 μm are demonstrated,26 applications in deep-tissue molecular imaging based on the second near-infrared region from 1.0 μm to 1.7 μm (ref. 27) and applications in remote sensing of beached marine plastic at bands including ∼1.2 μm and ∼1.7 μm.28
In this work, CdTe thin films with all kinds of defect states are purposely grown via a vdWE mode by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), and a simple water-assisted method is developed to peel off and transfer the vdWE CdTe to fabricate FET photodetectors. The characteristic on/off ratio of 39 and mobility of 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 reach optimal values in the archived CdTe. Besides the improved response sensitivity by gate modulation, the spectral detection region is greatly broadened far beyond the cutoff wavelength and well detailed by the photogating effect. Ultrahigh responsivity and detectivity beyond 3.84 A W−1 and 3.73 × 1011 Jones are realized in the whole extended range, which are comparable or superior to those of Si, Ge, GaP and InGaAs photodetectors.23–26 These excellent electronic and optoelectronic behaviors enrich the function of CdTe and enable strong competitiveness with those commercial detectors in the optical fiber communication wavelength region from 1.3 μm to 1.65 μm (ref. 23–25) and imaging applications in the LWNIR region where the natural phenomena known as air glow or night glow with a faint light around 1.25 μm and 1.6 μm are demonstrated.26
2 Experimental section
2.1 Film growth
The CdTe thin films were grown from all solid sources of MBE (Riber 32P) on mica (001) with an ultrahigh vacuum background pressure of 1 × 10−10 Torr. CdTe (99.999%), Te (99.999%) and Cd (99.999%) were evaporated from Knudsen cells as CdTe, Cd, and Te sources to grow CdTe. The extra Cd and Te effusion cells were used to control the stoichiometry of CdTe. In situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED, STAIB Instruments NEK 300R3-8) with a voltage of 20 kV and current of 1.6 A was applied to monitor the whole growth processes. One can refer to our previous reports on the details of mica substrate treatment and growth processes of MBE growth.10,19
2.2 Structural characterization
The PL spectra were measured with a step-scan Fourier transform infrared spectrometer-based modulated PL technique (Bruker IFS 80V/S). The HRXRD and FWHM were measured using a Bruker D8. The Raman spectrum was collected on a Renishaw inVi Reflex Raman microscope with a 532 nm excitation wavelength. A cross-sectional CdTe/SiO2/Si sample was prepared using a focused ion beam (FEI Helios G4 UX), and HRTEM and SAED were conducted using a JEOL JEM-ARM300 to obtain the interface information and crystalline structure properties.
2.3 Film transfer and device fabrication
A PDMS film was covered on vdWE CdTe thin films, and then PDMS/CdTe/Mica was immersed in deionized water to separate the CdTe film and Mica substrate. After 3 hours, the CdTe sample was removed from water and transferred on a n-type heavily doped Si substrate covered with a 280 nm SiO2 layer. The detailed exfoliation and transfer methods are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The device function areas schematically shown in Fig. 2a were fabricated through mask, electron beam lithography and argon-ion etching, and Cr/Au (20 nm/100 nm) were prepared through metal evaporation deposition and the lift-off method to form the drain and source metal electrode contact, where a device channel with a length of 1.5 μm and width of 100 μm were designed.
2.4 Electrical and photoelectronic characterization
All electrical measurements were performed at ambient atmosphere. The output curves and transfer curves in darkness and under the illumination of a 637 nm laser were measured using a Keysight B1500A. Time-resolved photocurrents with an incident light wavelength of a 637 nm laser were measured using a Keysight B1500A. Response time of the CdTe phototransistors illuminated by 637 nm light was recorded using a high-speed Tektronix MDO3014 oscilloscope. In addition, the output curves and time-resolved photocurrent measurements under the illumination of the representative wavelengths of 300 nm, 520 nm, 830 nm, 940 nm, 1.064 μm, 1.27 μm, 1.45 μm, 1.55 μm and 1.65 μm were performed using a MS200 system using a Keithley 2450 and 6482 respectively. The response time of all these wavelengths was recorded using a MS200 system using a PicoScope 4262 oscilloscope.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 MBE growth and transfer of CdTe thin films on mica
Epitaxial growth with atomic and/or sublattice layers can be realized by the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique.29 Therefore, high-quality single crystalline thin films, quantum wells and superlattices have been grown by MBE.29 More crucially, the stoichiometry and doping content of the epitaxial systems can be precisely controlled.29 Nowadays, we, the MBE team at ECNU, have mastered the MBE technique to grow Te-rich and Cd-rich CdTe thin films,19 where different defect levels are demonstrated. Here, Cd-rich CdTe thin films are grown on mica substrates by MBE with deep defect states located at 0.8 eV and 1.1 eV including the emission peaks of 1.4 eV, 1.55 eV, 1.59 eV and Eg (Fig. 1a). The inset (left) in Fig. 1a shows schematically the details of these levels and transitions. The X-band denotes the free excitons (FX), and the excitons bound to neutral acceptors and donors (D1X and A1X-LO). The origin of all these PL peaks is studied by the evolution with temperature as displayed in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Moreover, nominal stoichiometric and Te-rich CdTe thin films are also grown, and the PL spectra are shown in Fig. S2,† where the emissions of 0.8 eV and 1.1 eV are absent. The detailed growth processes are given in the Experimental section and ref. 19.

Recently, it has been widely reported that vdWE technique exhibits the capability of exfoliation and transfer of vdWE materials due to the weak intermolecular force among atoms at the interface between the epitaxial material and vdW substrate, displaying its great potential in transferable and flexible electronic and optoelectronic devices.7 A simple water-assisted method is developed to peel off and transfer the vdWE CdTe films onto a n+-type silicon substrate covered with SiO2. Exfoliation and transfer are detailed in the Experimental section and the schematic diagrams of the processes are shown in Fig. S3a.† Large-area transferable vdWE CdTe (denoted as T-CdTe) with a hundred microns scale is realized as evidenced in the optical microscope photographs (Fig. S3b to e†). The same XRD peaks of (111) at 23.74° and (333) at 76.21° for the vdWE CdTe and T-CdTe indicates that this proposed method is well qualified for the transfer of CdTe on mica substrates (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the T-CdTe is obviously narrowed (Fig. 1c), which may result from the strain alleviation in spite of the absence of covalence bonding between the CdTe and mica. Moreover, the appearance of the Raman characteristic peaks located at 141.8 cm−1 and 165.9 cm−1, assigned to the E2 vibration of Te (ref. 30) and LO mode of CdTe (ref. 31) both in vdWE CdTe and T-CdTe, further imply the well-defined crystalline structure of the CdTe after transfer, and that the extra vibration modes of 125.6 cm−1 and 521.0 cm−1 are from TeO2 and Si,32,33 respectively (Fig. 1d). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is also conducted to study the details of the crystalline structure and the interface of the transferred CdTe on SiO2/Si substrates. A perfect lattice fringe is demonstrated and the periodic spacing is approximately 0.374 nm (Fig. 1e), closely matching the (111) plane of CdTe (PDF no. 65-0440),10 which further confirms that the high-quality crystallinity is maintained for the vdWE CdTe after transfer. Moreover, the interface between T-CdTe and SiO2 is clear, flat and free of impurities (Fig. S4a and b†). Bragg diffraction spots in the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern prove the presence of a high-quality single crystalline phase after transfer and a zinc blende structure along the [111] direction (Fig. 1e).10
3.2 Electrical properties and optoelectronic performances
The T-CdTe thin film FET photodetectors were fabricated on a SiO2/Si wafer substrate, where the thickness of SiO2 is 285 nm. Vacuum-evaporated Cr/Au (20 nm/100 nm) was used as a metal electrode contact, and device channels with a length of 1.5 μm and width of 100 μm were designed. The device structure diagram and optical microscope graph of the CdTe phototransistor are plotted in Fig. 2a and the inset, respectively. The electrical properties of the detectors are characterized as displayed in Fig. 2b and c. A weak leakage current of IGS (Fig. S5a†) guarantees the carrier control ability using a gate and rules out the effects of IGS on the IDS and photogenerated currents. The output characteristic curves at different gate voltages from −20 V to 20 V indicate that the carrier concentration can be effectively controlled by a gate (Fig. 2b). CdTe exhibits a p-type behavior as determined by the IDS dependence on VGS extracted from Fig. 2b and detailed in Fig. S5b.† Note that IDS tends to be saturated with further increasing VGS (inset in Fig. 2c), and thus the gate voltage of 20 V is chosen for optoelectronic tests. The p-type behavior is also confirmed by transfer curves (Fig. 2c), where the characteristic of the on/off ratio and mobility μ for the FET devices are estimated to be ∼39 and 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. μ is calculated by the formula,10μ = (dIDS/dVGS) × [L/(W·ε0εr/d·VDS)], where L is the channel length, W is the channel width, ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant and εr = 3.9 is the dielectric constant of SiO2, d is the thickness of SiO2 films, and dIDS/dVGS is extracted from the left side of the linear region in Fig. 2c. The linear behavior of the output curves in the low VDS region means a low contact resistance, which ensures the soundness of the extraction of μ from the slope of the linear region of the transfer traces. The on/off ratio is 13 times higher than that of CdTe nanoribbon FETs.3μ is 4 times higher than that of the CdTe nanoribbon FET (ref. 3) and 18 times higher than that of the CdTe microwire FET.34 These results indicate a well-designed device structure of the CdTe FET and excellent crystalline quality of the transferred CdTe.

The inset shows the optical microscope photograph. (b) Output characteristics of the device with VGS from 20 V to −20 V at a step of 10 V. (c) Transfer characteristics of the device at different biases of 1 V, 5 V and 10 V, respectively. The inset shows transfer curves for different ranges of VGS from −20 V to +20 V (blue) and from −25 V to +25 V (red), respectively. (d) Output curves in the dark and at various incident light intensities. (e) Light intensity dependence of the R, D* and EQE (inset). (f) A separated response and reset cycle: τrising is 2.26 ms and τdecay is 1.99 ms, determined from the exponential functions, and the solid lines are the fit data. 

Fig. 2d illustrates the IDS–VDS curves in darkness and at various illumination intensities of a 637 nm laser from 6.17 μW cm−2 to 7.91 mW cm−2. To quantify the detection performances, crucial characteristic parameters of responsivity (R), specific detectivity (D*) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) are extracted and given in Fig. 2e. R is defined to be,10R = Iph/P, where Iph denotes the photocurrent (the difference between the currents with and without light illumination) and P is the incident light power. D* is expressed as,10D* = RS1/2/(2eIdark). Here e is the electron charge, Idark is the dark current and S represents the device effective area, and Idark is assumed to be the main contribution of noise sources. EQE is described as,10 EQE = hcR/λe, which reflects the ratio of the number of photoexcited electron and hole carriers to the number of incident photons. Here R is responsivity, h is the Planck constant, c denotes the speed of light in vacuum, λ denotes the wavelength and e is the electron charge. As a result, peak values of R, D* and EQE are determined to be 191.6 A W−1, 7.6 × 1012 Jones and 3.7 × 104% at a weak light intensity of 0.43 μW cm−2 and a 637 nm laser. These R and D* values are slightly smaller than those of the vdWE CdTe photodetector.10 However, R is larger than the 80.1 A W−1 of the CdTe nanowire photodetector35 and far larger than the 0.4 A W−1 of CdTe nBn detectors.36D* is comparable to the 5 × 1012 Jones of CdTe nanocomposite photodetectors3 while far higher than the 109 Jones of the CdTe nanosheet detectors.9 Additionally, the response and decay behaviors are characterized and well described using a single exponential function (Fig. 2f). The rise time and fall time are calculated to be 2.26 ms and 1.99 ms, respectively. These values are consistent with those of the vdWE CdTe photodetector,10 indicative of the fast photocurrent switching feature and the preserving of the crystalline quality for the CdTe after transfer.
3.3 Gate-modulated optoelectronic detection performances
In order to characterize the response performance modulated by a gate voltage, we test the currents with and without light illumination both in dynamic and static cases. As presented in Fig. 3a, a more sensitive photoresponse is observed at a positive gate voltage due to the suppression of the dark current from the nature of p-type of the CdTe, which is one of the most crucial effective routes to enhance sensitivity as reflected directly by D*. To explore the modulation ability of a gate, IDS–VDS at different light intensities of a 637 nm laser from 3.02 μW cm−2 to 14.9 mW cm−2 are measured at different VGS values from −20 to 20 V (Fig. S6†). Fig. 3b summarizes the D* dependence on light intensity at the selected gate voltages, and D* can be tuned from 1.8 × 1012 Jones at −20 V to 9.0 × 1012 Jones at 20 V with a light intensity of 3.02 μW cm−2. Clearly, the CdTe FET photodetector displays a strong gate-modulation behavior, and the D* value increases by a factor of 5 from −20 V to 20 V (inset in Fig. 3b). Moreover, the gate-modulation ability for the CdTe FET photodetector is also evidenced by the measurement of photo and dark currents at some selected lasers with the wavelengths of 300 nm, 520 nm, 637 nm and 830 nm (Fig. S7†) at the gate voltages of 0 V and 20 V, respectively. Various evolutions of the photo and dark currents with and without gate voltages (Fig. S7†) are further indicative of the gate modulation ability resulting from the suppression of hole concentrations of the p-type CdTe which can lead to the improved D*.

(c) The output characteristics of the device in the dark and under illumination with the representative wavelengths of 637 nm, 830 nm, 1.06 μm and 1.55 μm at VGS = 20 V. (d) The output characteristics with 1.55 μm incident light and light intensity are 3.4 mW cm−2, 60 mW cm−2 and 793 mW cm−2. (e) The ratio of Ilight/Idark with different selected wavelengths at VGS = 0 V and VGS = 20 V at 0.02 mW cm−2. (f) Illumination light wavelength dependence of the normalized R at VGS = 0 V and VGS = 20 V. The inset shows the D* and EQE dependence on the wavelengths at VGS = 20 V. 
More interestingly, besides the improved detection sensitivity by a gate, we note that the detection wavelength is greatly lengthened by an external gate far beyond the 870 nm wavelength of Eg for CdTe of 1.5 eV at RT.7 The spectral detection range extension by a dielectric and nonvolatile ferroelectric field is widely reported in 2D materials and their heterojunctions ascribed to a narrowed energy gap due to the Stark effect.37,38 To detail the photoresponse performances at the whole extended spectra, therefore, some typical wavelengths of 940 nm, 1.06 μm, 1.27 μm, 1.45 μm, 1.55 μm and 1.65 μm are respectively selected, and photo and dark currents are measured with and without a gate. IDS–VDS curves with different light intensities at the gates of 0 V and 20 V for all these selected wavelengths are respectively plotted in Fig. S8,† and 3c as a representative case of the 1.55 μm wavelength. IDS is independent of the illumination intensity when VGS is 0 V, implying that negligible and even no photoresponse is present without a gate in the extended region (Fig. 3c). In contrast, IDS increases obviously with increasing the light intensity as the gate voltage is 20 V (Fig. 3c), indicative of the presence of an unambiguous photocurrent generation with the gate. This is also proved by the output characteristics in darkness and under light illumination with the representative wavelengths of 637 nm, 830 nm, 1.06 μm and 1.55 μm, for clarity, as VGS is 20 V (Fig. 3d). The gate-modulated photoresponse can be clearly evidenced by the Ilight/Idark ratios of all these selected wavelengths at 20 μW cm−2 (Fig. 3e). These data are extracted from the IDS–VDS curves without and with gate voltages (Fig. S8† and 3c). The CdTe FET photodetector shows 1.7–3.4 times improved Ilight/Idark ratios below 830 nm with a gate owing to the suppressed dark currents. More crucially, the Ilight/Idark ratios beyond 830 nm is obviously demonstrated, further evidencing the spectral detection range extension (Fig. 3e). The spectral detection range with and without a gate are also measured to determine the cut-off wavelength (λcut-off). The typical photoresponse spectrum without a gate is from the ultraviolet (UV) to short-wave near infrared (SWNIR) wavelength (Fig. 3f), and λcut-off is 870 nm as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 3f, in good agreement with those of CdTe,10 P3HT:CdTe (ref. 3) and CdTe nBn photodetectors.36 In contrast, the detection spectrum under the gate control of 20 V is significantly broadened, and the response wavelength reaches 1.65 μm of the LWNIR wavelength (Fig. 3f), exhibiting a strong gate-modulation ability and also great potential in the detection of the optical fiber communication wavelength band from 1.3 μm to 1.65 μm,23–25 and LWNIR imaging applications where the natural phenomena known as air glow and night glow with a faint light around 1.25 μm and 1.6 μm are demonstrated.26
To quantify the characteristic parameters of the CdTe phototransistor under gate modulation, the power dependence of R, D* and EQE are calculated from the IDS–VDS curves in darkness and light illumination cases with different intensities at VGS = 20 V and VDS = 10 V, and the data are given in Fig. S9.† The optimal D* and EQE values of all these different wavelengths are summarized in the inset of Fig. 3f. These D* and EQE peak values exceed 3 × 1011 Jones and 300% in the whole extended region from 830 nm to 1.65 μm. For instance, at 1.45 μm wavelength, R, D* and EQE reach 10.2 A W−1, 9.3 × 1011 Jones and 870% with the gate of 20 V, respectively. These characteristic parameters are comparable to 0.84 A W−1R and 1.02 × 1011 Jones D* for the Ge, R (1.03 A W−1) and D* (2.93 × 1012 Jones) for the InGaAs, and D* (109 Jones) of SWIR MCT commercial photodetectors,23,39 novel WSe2/SnSe2 (ref. 40) (R: 80 A W−1, D*: 1.4 × 1010 Jones), graphene/MCT (R: 2.6 A W−1, D*: 1.45 × 1012 Jones) heterostructure detectors,41 and much superior to those of R (0.0518 A W−1) and D* (1.38 × 1010 Jones) of graphene/Ge,24R (0.4 A W−1) and D* (2 × 108 Jones) of the graphene/Si photodetector.25 These data clearly indicate that the CdTe phototransistor by gate modulation exhibits an ultrasensitive detection performance, and thus a strong competitiveness with the above-mentioned commercial and novel devices such as transceivers, modulators and detectors in integrated photonics operated at a wavelength between 1.3 μm and 1.65 μm. Moreover, the temporal photocurrent response at some typical wavelengths of 830 nm, 940 nm, 1064 nm, 1.45 μm and 1.55 μm in the extended spectrum range are conducted to test the stability and reliability, and the data are plotted in Fig. S10.† Clearly, highly stable and reliable photocurrent switching between the low and high conductivity are found at all these wavelengths, confirming a good mechanical behavior of the CdTe phototransistor at a gate voltage of 20 V.
For a detailed performance comparison, Fig. 4a and b reveal the characteristic parameters of R and D* for a photodetector, including the CdTe phototransistor, diverse CdTe3,35,36,42–46 detectors, some typical II–VI semiconductor detectors,47–49 commercial Si, Ge, InGaAs, GaP, PbS and MCT photodetectors,23,50,51 novel 2D/3D heterojunction photodetectors built from these three-dimensional (3D) bulks and 2D materials,24,25,41,52 and 2D materials and their heterojunction detectors.38,40 Obviously, besides an ultrasensitive performance with ultrahigh R and D* as well as a very fast response speed, an extended spectral response region from UV to LWNIR is demonstrated in CdTe phototransistors by gate modulation. The outstanding electrical and optoelectronic properties achieved in the CdTe phototransistor with a gate voltage avail the multifunction of CdTe and also show a strong competitiveness with Si, Ge, GaP, InGaAs and MCT photodetectors, and especially MCT photodetectors due to a Hg unfriendly environment.

3.4 Mechanism of the improved detection performance with a gate
Usually, it is well accepted that the detection sensitivity can be improved for a phototransistor by a gate voltage due to the carrier concentration suppression in the conductive channel, which leads to a drop of the dark current.38 However, the extension of the spectral detection range is mainly involved in some 2D materials while it is absent in 3D bulk semiconductors due to an external dielectric and nonvolatile ferroelectric field. Hence, it is of significance to shed light on what the physics mechanism is. Generally, photocurrent generation in a semiconductor photodetector is the photoconductive effect,15 in which excess free carriers are excited by photon absorption and bring about the reduction of conductivity for the semiconductor. Additionally, photogating is proposed to well account for the improved response.12 When the holes (electrons) are photogenerated, they will be captured by defect states and trapped in the localized states, which can act as a local gate (ΔVGS) and produce effectively an extra electric field inducing more electrons (holes) in the channel and thus modulating the conductivity.13Fig. 5a and b present the power dependence of R and Iph at different illumination wavelengths. Note that the dependence of R and Iph on the power can be divided into four categories according to the illumination wavelength as displayed in Fig. 5a and b, and also indicated by the power dependence of D* (Fig. S9a†) and EQE (Fig. S9b†). Based on the photon energy, the four categories include (1) Ephoton > Eg, (2) Ephoton ∼ Eg, (3) 1.1 eV < Ephoton < Eg, and (4) 0.8 eV < Ephoton < 1.1 eV, which agree well with the PL emissions (Fig. 1a). According to the expression, R ∼ P−β,12 the β value at different illumination wavelengths is calculated and increases from 0.49 ± 0.01 to 0.8 ± 0.05 with increasing the light wavelength as given in Fig. 5a. Moreover, the power dependence of Iph at these selected wavelengths is well described by the relationship,13Iph ∼ Psθ, as indicated by the solid lines in Fig. 5b. The fit θ dependent on the wavelength is summarized in the inset in Fig. 5b. β increasing while θ decreasing with the incident wavelength is a strong indication of the appearance of photogating in the photocurrent generation.13 Crucially, the fit θ can reflect the dominance either the photoconductive effect or the photogating effect, that is θ close to 1 means the dominant photoconductive effect. It is obvious from the inset in Fig. 5b that the evolution of θ with the wavelength gives the evidence of the photogating effect in photocurrent generation in the extended response spectrum.

(b) Power dependence of Iph with incident light wavelengths of 637 nm, 830 nm, 1.06 μm and 1.55 μm. The inset shows the wavelength dependence of the linearity θ. (c) Transfer curves at VDS = 5 V in the dark and at various incident light powers (λ = 637 nm). (d) The rising time dependence on the wavelengths. The inset shows the schematic diagram for different transition processes. CB: conduction band, VB: valence band, HH: heavy hole and LH: light hole. (e) The diagrams for the possible mechanism in expanding the detection wavelength range in consideration of a gate at VGS = 0 V (1), VGS = 20 V (2) in the dark and VGS = 20 V (3) with light illumination. DES denotes the deep energy states. 
The pure photoconductive effect and photogating effect are distinguished by comparing the transfer curves of IDS–VDS at a gate voltage without/with light illumination.12 When the photogating effect is dominant, there is a horizontal shift of the Iph–VGS trace due to the existing local equivalent gate correlated with the localized defect states.13 The occurrence of a photogating effect in the CdTe phototransistor is further confirmed by the Iph–VGS traces (Fig. 5c). The formation of localized defect states is intentional in CdTe material MBE processes as implied by the PL emissions (Fig. 1a). In addition, it is well-accepted that the minority lifetime of excess carriers varies significantly with the level position where they live,18–20 and shallow defect levels with direct recombination would bring out a shorter carrier lifetime while deep impurities and defects delay the recombination of excess carriers and thus lead to a longer lifetime in CdTe.18–20 As a consequence, including the 637 nm wavelength, time-resolved photoresponse behaviors of the representative wavelengths of 830 nm, 940 nm, 1064 nm and 1.55 μm are also observed to evaluate the lifetime τph and the data are plotted in Fig. S11.† The rising times are calculated and given in Fig. 5d, which shows a similar evolution to those of the time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra widely reported in CdTe.18–20 The inset of Fig. 5d presents the transition mechanisms including Auger recombination (I), band-to-band emission (II) and deep energy state (DES, III, including the defect states at 0.8 eV and 1.1 eV) transitions associated with the processes of i and ii as shown in the inset in Fig. 1a. To shed light on the possible mechanism in extending the spectral detection range, the diagrams in consideration of a gate and DES with/without light illumination are illustrated in Fig. 5e. The DESs are filled without a gate voltage deduced from the Nature of the p-type of the vdWE CdTe, and thus no excess carriers can be generated in the extended spectral region [Fig. 5e(1)]. However, when a positive gate is applied, the electrons trapped by the DES potential will be driven away and recombine with holes, which modifies the Fermi level (EF) and creates more empty levels [Fig. 5e(2)]. In this case, these empty levels would provide more quantum states for the photogenerated electrons undertaking the role of a gate, i.e. photogating effect, and hence the photogenerated excess holes enable the photocurrent generation [Fig. 5e(3)], which qualifies the Cd-rich CdTe to detect the LWNIR with the center position of 0.8 eV deep defect levels as presented in Fig. 1a. This mechanism is similar to that of Ga:Ge, As:Si and Au:Si photodetectors,21,22 where the photodetection range can be extended to a VLWIR and a middle-wavelength infrared (MWIR) response by virtue of the shallow and deep doping levels.21,22
4 Conclusions
In summary, CdTe thin films with deep energy defect states at 0.8 eV and 1.1 eV are purposely grown via a vdWE mode by MBE. A simple water-assisted method is proposed to peel off and transfer the vdWE CdTe. FET phototransistors are fabricated with these transferred CdTe, and the characteristic on/off ratio of 39 and mobility of 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 are realized, confirming the high-crystalline quality of the transferred CdTe and well-designed device structure. The sensitivity is greatly improved and the detection range is extended to LWNIR of 1.65 μm far beyond the λcutoff of 870 nm by gate modulation. Moreover, ultrahigh responsivity and detectivity above 3.84 A W−1 and 3.73 ×1011 Jones, respectively, are demonstrated in the whole extended spectral detection range owing to the photogating. These data exhibit a significant prospect in the detection of the optical fiber communication wavelength band from 1.3 μm to 1.65 μm, and imaging applications in the LWNIR region where the air and night glow with a faint light around 1.25 μm and 1.6 μm are demonstrated.
