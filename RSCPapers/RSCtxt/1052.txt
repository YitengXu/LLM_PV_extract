    , Accepted 23rd February 2012First published on 23rd February 2012AbstractHere, we find that doping sp2 selective nitrogen, N sp2, into carbon nanotube (CNT) channels induces a positive shift in the Fermi level of TiO2 photoelectrodes. It is found that this results in the large diffusion coefficient of solar driven electrons for increasing the photocurrent as well as in the low recombination rate for improving open circuit voltage with 0.74 V, which could not be overcome by using pristine CNT channels with 0.66 V.
Introduction
A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) offers many advantages for the solar energy conversion due to many promising perspectives such as low integration cost and simple methodology. For a higher energy conversion efficiency, new dyes capable of absorbing a wide range of light,1–5 electrolytes enabling a fast separation of electrons from electron–hole pairs,6,7 and efficient charge carrier collectors have been developed.8–13 Moreover, introducing highly ordered TiO2 structures and conducting materials11,14–21 such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into mesoporous TiO2 layers has been suggested as a novel strategy to develop an effective electron transport channel for higher photoelectron collection efficiency. In addition, the dye sensitized solar cell with a carbon based electrode is of great potential to be used as a flexible or ITO/glass-free solar cell. Currently, carbon nanotube or graphene structures have been suggested as the candidate for this purpose. The difficulty in using carbon material as an electrode at photoanode is that Voc is decreased as the portion of the carbon material is increased at the photoanode.21 Previously, the incorporation of CNTs into the mesoporous TiO2 layer enhanced the photocurrent of DSSCs, but resulted in a significant drop in the open circuit voltage (Voc)14,17 due to the lower Fermi energy level of CNTs.21 Therefore, developing effective transport channels while preserving the open circuit voltage simultaneously is still a great challenge.
If the states of nanotubes could resonate with states around the conduction band edge of TiO2 nanoparticles while promoting the electron collection, the intrinsically fast electron transport property could provide a fast transport channel to the electron-collecting substrate and contribute significantly to the higher photocurrent compared to the case working through electron hopping when only TiO2 networks are used. This ideal case is for the sp2 nitrogen-doped n-type carbon nanotubes, as demonstrated by our first principles calculation.22
Here, we used the sp2 nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N(sp2)-CNTs) introduced into the mesoporous TiO2 layer for a new route to allow enhanced photocurrent density without loss of the open circuit voltage (Voc) which should be decreased on pristine CNT channels. In addition, lengths of N(sp2)-CNT extended channels are also found to be important for enhancement of the photocurrent.
Experimental
Synthesis of N(sp2)-CNTs
The N(sp2)-CNTs were synthesized by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) on Si substrates using Fe nanoparticles as catalysts and CH4 and H2 or/and N2 as flowing gases. First, the catalyst-containing substrate was transferred to a PECVD chamber and heated to 700 °C at the pressure of 10−1 Torr. Then, nitrogen (N2) was introduced into the chamber with a controlled mass flow rate. Plasma was ignited by microwaves when the pressure of the chamber reached 12 Torr. The nitrogen plasma was kept for 1 min. Next, methane gas was introduced after 1 min and nanotubes started to grow on Fe catalyst sites. To synthesize nitrogen-doped CNTs, we varied the relative N2 gas flow compared to CH4 gas flow (CH4∶N2 = 60 sccm∶60 sccm for N(sp2)-CNTs), while the nanotubes with N(sp2) and N(sp3) were synthesized with 20 sccm of CH4 and 100 sccm of N2. The growth time used to grow the short nanotubes was 30 s while 20 minutes were used to grow long nanotubes. The lengths of short and long nanotubes with the average diameter of 15 nm were determined to be about 2.5 μm and 40 μm, respectively.
In general, N-doped carbon nanotubes showed three peaks corresponding to N(sp2), N(sp3), and molecular N2 sequestered inside bamboo-like cages of N-doped nanotubes (detailed information is given in ESI† in Fig. S1). Meanwhile, our X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrated that sp2 selective N-doped carbon nanotubes could be synthesized, as demonstrated from the unique N 1s spectrum of 401.3 eV corresponding to graphite-like nitrogen23 (Fig. 1a).
 Fig. 1  (a) Nitrogen binding characteristics of N(sp2)-CNTs from XPS show that the nanotube is in the sp2-selective nitrogen atom configuration, (b) open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.9, 0.2, 0.025, and 0.01% (w/w) N(sp2)-CNTs and CNTs with respect to TiO2 in SI, SII, and SIII arrangements. 
Preparation of photoelectrodes
TiO2 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 25 nm (P25; Degusa, Germany) were used to make the colloidal mixture in combination with 50% w/w hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) (Aldrich, USA) after pre-treatment with acetylacetone.24 Next, pristine CNTs and N(sp2)-CNTs were added to the TiO2 colloidal mixtures at either 0.9, 0.2, 0.025, or 0.01% w/w.
Three different extended spatial arrangements of N(sp2)-CNT channels inside the TiO2 mesoporous layer, denoted as SI, SII, and SIII, with ca. 1 μm thickness were prepared. SI was prepared by spin coating N(sp2)-CNT mixed with TiO2 paste two times on FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide) to make N(sp2)-CNT uniformly dispersed in the TiO2 layer. For SII, N(sp2)-CNTs with an average length of 3 μm were electrodeposited on FTO by applying 25 V for 10 min before the same thickness of TiO2 colloidal mixture was spun-coated, where N(sp2)-CNTs are mainly positioned near FTO. SIII was prepared by spin coating pristine TiO2 nanoparticles on FTO and then followed by deposition of N(sp2)-CNT mixed with TiO2 paste on them to avoid the direct contact of N(sp2)-CNT with FTO. Additionally, an extended SI structure composed of 40 μm N(sp2)-CNTs, SI (long), was also prepared. All electrodes were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min in air.
Device fabrication
For dye loading, the electrodes were dipped into 0.3 mM ethanolic solution of cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis-tetrabutylammonium dye (N719) for 18 h. All counter electrodes were prepared by spin coating 5 mM ethanolic solution of chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O) followed by sintering at 380 °C for 20 min. The photoelectrodes and counter electrodes were sandwiched together using Surlyn polymer film as a spacer and a sealing agent at 110 °C for 10 min. Finally, the electrolyte solution of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) was injected into the cell through pre-drilled holes on the back side of the counter electrode and the holes were sealed with scotch tape.
Measurements
The 1.5 AM simulated light was designed using a 200 W xenon lamp (Polaronoix® K201). A photovoltaic power meter (Polaronoix® K101 LAB20) was used to determine the J–V curves. The incident light intensity was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun) by a standard mono-Si solar cell (PVM 396). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained under dark conditions at the frequency range of 105–0.1 Hz with the ac amplitude of 10 mV (IM6ex). The applied bias was set to Voc of each cell.
Theoretical
The three dimensional (3D) Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation25,26 was performed using the SeqQuest program27 to determine the electronic structures of nanotubes with infinite lengths. As a model structure, a (10,0) nanotube composed of 10 basic unit cells and a (6,6) nanotube composed of 8 basic unit cells along the z direction were used, where 7 and 3 carbons were replaced by nitrogen atoms for (10,0) and (6,6) nanotubes respectively (2 wt%, 1.8 wt% of nitrogen). Then, the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional,28 norm-conserving pseudopotentials29,30 on double-ζ-polarization quality Gaussian basis sets for C and N atoms, respectively, were used to determine the geometries and their corresponding electronic structures.
Results and discussion
The variation of Voc at different concentrations of N(sp2)-CNTs and CNTs is shown in Fig. 1b for SI and SIII arrangements (the corresponding cell parameters are summarized in Table S2, ESI†). As the concentration of N(sp2)-CNTs was increased (>0.2 wt%), the Voc decay was negligible and remained similar to the value of the reference system.

Fig. 2 shows current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSSCs with photoelectrodes in three different spatial arrangements of SI, SII, and SIII. The incorporation of N(sp2)-CNTs into TiO2 photoelectrodes resulted in the increase of photocurrents, in addition to their open circuit voltages and cell efficiencies, compared to the cell made of a pure TiO2 layer at the optimized concentration. These results demonstrated that the superior electron collection and transport properties were attributed to additional conduction channels created by N(sp2)-CNTs inside the TiO2 layer. The specific photocurrent characteristics of a DSSC upon incorporation of pristine CNTs16,17 and three different cell structures are shown in ESI.† On the other hand, it was found that J–V characteristics of DSSCs with the incorporation of mixed sp2- and sp3-nitrogen doped-CNTs into TiO2 photoelectrodes resulted in increasing recombination (decreased Voc, less increased Jsc) compared to those of N(sp2)-CNTs (Fig. S1a, ESI†), as expected from first principles calculation.22

To investigate the charge transfer kinetics at the TiO2|N(sp2)-CNTs|electrolyte interfaces, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed under dark conditions. According to the Bode plots for SI, SII, and SIII arrangements (Fig. 3), three peaks are usually observed at three different frequency regions.31–33 The high-frequency peak, ωmax, represents the electron transfer rates at the Pt|electrolyte and substrate|electrolyte interfaces. Any change in the high-frequency peak (ωmax) was attributed to the electron back transfer rate at the interface between the conducting substrate of the photoelectrode and the electrolyte due to the invariance of the Pt|electrolyte interface. Therefore, ωmax could be considered as the apparent rate of the back transfer of electrons from uncovered or N(sp2)-CNTs modified FTO to the electrolyte (kS/E). This was also referred to as the electron leakage at the photoelectrode. The mid-frequency peak, , corresponded to the rate of back reaction of electrons at the interface of TiO2 with the electrolyte (kT/E). The high density of surface states at the interfaces of FTO–TiO2 because of the localization of nanotubes (TiO2|N(sp2)-CNT and FTO|N(sp2)-CNT) (SII) was responsible for the increase of the catalytic effect on the reduction of triiodide (I3−) at both TiO2|electrolyte(kT/E) and substrate|electrolyte(kS/E) in the vicinity of conducting substrates, even though they were less functional as electron traps for the N(sp2)-CNT compared to a pristine CNT (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  EIS Bode plots for DSSCs with N(sp2)-CNTs in SI, SII, and SIII arrangements under dark conditions. Both tables show back reaction rate constants at the interfaces of TiO2|nanotubes (kT/E from mid-frequency peak, ) and FTO|nanotubes (kS/E from high frequency peak, ωmax) for CNT and N(sp2)-CNT. 
This supports the slight decrease in the Voc for SII (Fig. 2). For pristine carbon nanotubes, the back electron transfer rate and the Voc for SII are more severely decreased. Moreover, it was found that kT/E of SI and SIII remained the same as those with the pristine TiO2 nanoparticles. This demonstrates that STC(N), the energy level of which is close to that of ECB,TiO2, was not contributing to enhance the back transfer rate of electrons to the electrolyte. In addition, we found that the long nanotubes increase the electron collection efficiency (Fig. S2 in ESI†). The longer nanotubes (40 μm) in SI exhibited a 12% higher power conversion than the smaller one (3 μm) while Voc was maintained. The electron diffusion coefficient (Dn) is also found to be enhanced (Fig. S2 in ESI†).
The formation of surface states or traps at hetero-junction interfaces of FTO|nanotubes (SFC for pristine CNT and SFC(N) for N(sp2)-CNT) and TiO2|nanotubes (STC for pristine CNT and STC(N) for N(sp2)-CNT) is reported to give the shift in the pseudo Fermi level for the TiO2 photoelectrode.34 Since the pristine CNT had a Fermi energy of −4.64 eV,35 the Fermi energies at hetero-junction interfaces were located at the lower level compared to that of FTO itself and the conduction band edge of TiO2 (ECB,TiO2). This gives the overall negative shift in the pseudo Fermi level for the TiO2 photoelectrode.
However, the Fermi energy of a N(sp2)-CNT36 was similar to the energy level of the conduction band of TiO2 nanoparticles (−4.20 eV), thus being expected not to allow the negative shift in the pseudo Fermi level of the TiO2 photoelectrode. Our first-principles theory calculations on the SeqQuest program showed that the Fermi levels of pristine CNTs were −4.59 and −4.62 eV for (6,6) and (10,0) nanotubes, respectively, while they shifted to −4.18 and −4.14 eV by the sp2 selective doping of carbon nanotubes by 2 wt% nitrogen. Consequently, this provides the important implication that the N(sp2) doping shifts up the Fermi energy level of pristine CNTs. Since it is similar to the conduction band edge of the TiO2 nanoparticles (−4.2 eV) and more positive than the Fermi energy level of FTO (−4.4 eV),37 the energy levels of the surface state at the FTO|N(sp2)-CNT interface, SFC(N), should exist at a higher level than the Fermi level of FTO (Fig. 4). Similarly, STC(N) at TiO2|N(sp2)-CNT was expected to be located around the conduction band edge of TiO2 nanoparticles (ECB,TiO2), as shown in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Schematic diagram and energy level diagram of surface states in SI, SII, and SIII for pristine CNTs and N(sp2)-CNT channels. The quasi Fermi level of TiO2 (EFn) is down shifted for pristine CNTs-incorporated TiO2 photoelectrodes () due to formation of surface states with significant negative energy levels (red lines) at the interfaces of FTO|CNTs (SFC) and TiO2|CNTs (STC) (SFC(N) and STC(N) for N(sp2)-CNTs). The positive shifting of surfaces states by N(sp2)-CNTs results in an insignificant change in quasi Fermi energy of TiO2 photoelectrodes. CB means the conduction band of bare TiO2. 
The Fermi energy difference (Δ) caused by deeply located surface states because of the incorporation of nanotubes is responsible for decreased Voc, defined as the difference between the pseudo Fermi level of the photoelectrode and the energy level of the redox couple. It is defined as EFs = EFn − Δ, where EFs and EFn are the Fermi energy of a surface state and a pristine TiO2 layer, respectively. This is also dependent on thermal energy for electron trapping and is correlated with electron recombination from surface states to oxidized species compared to detrapping from surface states, as expressed by eqn (1).34 Δ = kBTln(1 + ks/ε),(1)where ks is the rate of electron transfer to the oxidized species in solution and ε is the probability of the electron detrapping to the conduction band. In this view, ks/ε depends on the energy level of additional surface states and the lower energy level states facilitating the recombination of trapped electrons with redox couples in the electrolyte. Therefore, deeply located surface states in the mesoporous TiO2 layer would increase the Fermi energy difference (Δ) and be responsible for decreased Voc. This was consistent with the enhanced electron recombination at FTO|CNTs and TiO2|CNTs interfaces (Fig. 4), especially at highly concentrated conditions (Table S1, ESI†). The performance of a DSSC with a high concentration of pristine CNTs in TiO2 photoelectrodes is known to decrease significantly. This is because the blocking or attenuation of light absorption due to the inherent dark nature of CNTs and the facilitation of the electron back transfer by the increased contribution of surface states (SFC and STC) within the photoelectrode were responsible for the significant decrease in Voc when the concentration of pristine CNTs was increased (Fig. 1b).
Meanwhile, in the case of N(sp2)-CNTs, the surface state of SFC(N) would not form trap states at much lower energy levels. In addition, other surface states at the TiO2|N(sp2)-CNT interface, STC(N), the energy level of which is very close to that of ECB,TiO2, would not operate as electron traps, but would increase the electron collection efficiency by providing a fast electron transport channel over the mesoporous TiO2 layer (Fig. 4). It was desirable to maintain the TiO2 layer thin enough to amplify and isolate the effect of surface states on the cell performance when nanotubes were introduced into the photoanode.
Conclusion
Incorporation of the sp2 selective nitrogen atom, N(sp2), into carbon nanotubes has been found to induce a positive shift in the quasi Fermi level of the photoelectrode (EFn) while preserving the intrinsically fast electron transport properties of CNTs. Therefore, we conclude that the tuning of EFn by the extended N(sp2)-doped carbon nanotubes provides effective channels to allow the express photoelectron transport while minimizing the open circuit voltage decay, which was intrinsically incapable of being overcome by using the extended pristine CNTs. This concept provides new insight in carbon electrodes for thin film dye sensitized solar cells preventing the open circuit voltage decay.

Both tables show back reaction rate constants at the interfaces of TiO2|nanotubes (kT/E from mid-frequency peak, ) and FTO|nanotubes (kS/E from high frequency peak, ωmax) for CNT and N(sp2)-CNT.	 

 	Fig. 4  Schematic diagram and energy level diagram of surface states in SI, SII, and SIII for pristine CNTs and N(sp2)-CNT channels. The quasi Fermi level of TiO2 (EFn) is down shifted for pristine CNTs-incorporated TiO2 photoelectrodes () due to formation of surface states with significant negative energy levels (red lines) at the interfaces of FTO|CNTs (SFC) and TiO2|CNTs (STC) (SFC(N) and STC(N) for N(sp2)-CNTs). The positive shifting of surfaces states by N(sp2)-CNTs results in an insignificant change in quasi Fermi energy of TiO2 photoelectrodes. CB means the conduction band of bare TiO2.
