    , Accepted 27th May 2022First published on 28th May 2022AbstractWe propose an advanced design of a plasmon-triggered Z-scheme for efficient overall water splitting (OWS), performed without the addition of sacrificial agents and by utilizing photons with longer wavelengths (close to NIR). As a Z-scheme, we used WO3 flakes coupled with CdS quantum dots, which ensured OWS under illumination with shorter wavelengths. As a plasmonic support, a periodical Au grating, able to support surface plasmon polariton excitation under NIR illumination, was used. The efficiency of the proposed structure was tested using photo-electrochemical and solely light-induced OWS. It was demonstrated that plasmon triggering makes the utilization of low-energy photons possible in OWS. The amount of light-produced hydrogen increased synergistically under double-wavelengths (simultaneous Z-scheme triggering and plasmon excitation) or broad light spectrum illumination. Thus, our work shows an effective way to increase the efficiency of the Z-scheme for OWS with the complete utilization of sunlight energy.
Introduction
Global warming, air pollution, and energy and material crises require the implementation of comprehensive solutions based on renewable energy sources and abundant materials.1–9 Sunlight is considered as the most promising energy source for the production of chemical fuels, which can ensure an energy-neutral and environmentally safe future.10–17 The sunlight-induced overall water splitting (OWS) process, which mimics natural light harvesting without additional energy inputs, is the most promising technology to generate carbon-free hydrogen fuels.18,19 However, the widespread use of sunlight OWS is limited by process efficiency, which depends on three basic events-light harvesting, electron–hole pair separation/migration, and the efficiency of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) on used material surfaces.20–22 In this regard, an ideal material for sunlight OWS should exhibit extended light absorption, enhanced charge separation, and have suitable positions of valence and conductive bands for HER and OER as well as abundant catalytic sites.23–26 Indeed, it is difficult to reach these properties in the framework of single materials, and hence, a combination of several materials has been proposed.27–29
The artificial Z-scheme system, based on II-coupled semiconductors, was introduced to relax the material band gap and charge generation/separation requirements.28–38 In an optimal Z-scheme design, HER and OER should occur at different semiconductors, while the residual electrons and holes with insufficient energy for HER and OER should recombine, making the photo-induced OWS a self-sufficient process.39–41 The implementation of Z-scheme design allows to significantly increase the photo-induced OWS efficiency, which, however, is still insufficient compared to that required for economically feasible applications.42,43 The main limitations of the actual Z-scheme design are related to the utilization of just the short-wavelength part of the sunlight (commonly, with λ < 500 nm) and the requirements for the addition of sacrificial agents.44–46 Therefore, it is highly necessary to find a novel Z-scheme design and material concepts for increase in overall water splitting, avoiding the addition of any sacrificial agents, and the utilization of all parts of the sunlight spectrum.47–50
In this work, we propose the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) triggering of the Z-scheme as a promising way to expand the available wavelength range up to the NIR region51 and perform OWS without the addition of sacrificial agents. We also investigated the synergy in photochemical energy conversion induced by higher energy photons (absorbed by Z-scheme) and lower energy photons (responsible for SPP excitation).
Experimental
Detailed description of materials, sample preparation, and characterization is given in the ESI.†
Sample preparation
WO3 nanoflakes were prepared by the modification of a previously published route.52 CdS quantum dots were synthesized directly on the WO3 flake surface by the subsequent addition of cadmium and sodium sulphide under vigorous stirring. The as-prepared WO3–CdS flakes were purified using several subsequent cycles (3×) of centrifugation, sediment washing, and ultrasound-assisted re-dispersion in deionized water. Finally, WO3–CdS flakes were re-suspended in methanol. A periodic Au grating was prepared from a DVD-R disk (Verbatim) patterned substrate by Au sputtering with the formation of optimal gold thickness for SPP excitation. The deposition of WO3–CdS flakes on the grating surface was performed using the spin-coating procedure under optimal speed and suspension concentration.
Water splitting functionality tests
In photo-electrochemical experiment samples, catalytic activities toward HER and OER were studied by linear sweep voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, and chronoamperometry. All electrochemical measurements were performed under illumination with LEDs (405, 530, 630, 730, 780, 850, and 1050 nm wavelength and power on the surface was adjusted to a constant level of 25 mW cm−2) or in the dark with a portable potentiostat PalmSens 4 (Palm Instruments, Netherlands) in a three-electrode cell. The sample was used as the working electrode, Pt as the counter electrode, and fresh Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. Measurements of HER and OER were carried out in N2-saturated 1 M KOH solutions. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in 1 M KOH solution in the frequency range of 1–100 000 Hz (applied potential was 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl). In impedance measurements, an equivalent electrical circuit comprising solution resistance, contact interface resistance, and constant phase element was used.
In solely light induced OWS experiments, the samples (with a surface area of 3 × 3 cm2) were placed in reaction cells and illuminated with simulated sunlight (Solar Simulator SciSun-300, Class AAA, and intensity on sample surface was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2). The evolved H2 and O2 were determined at 2 h intervals using an online gas chromatography system (GC-7920).
The solar to hydrogen conversion was calculated according the equation:53  where RH2 is the rate of H2 production, ΔG0 is the corresponding Gibbs free energy (237 kJ mol−1), Psolar is the total incident solar power on the sample surface, and S is the sample area.
In control measurements performed with the addition of sacrificial agents, a mixture of 0.35 M Na2S and 0.25 M Na2SO3 solutions was used as a hole scavenger, while 0.1 M AgNO3 solution was used as an electron scavenger.
Results and discussion
The utilization of the plasmon triggering of the semiconductor material photo/electrochemical catalytic activity has been widely reported.54–56 Commonly, the enhancement of catalytic activity occurs due to the plasmon-assisted injection of hot electrons or holes in the semiconductor, enhancement of electron–hole pair generation inside the semiconductor, and the acceleration of charge carrier migration and separation.57,58 Most of these events have been reported for the combination of a single semiconductor with plasmonic structures, but there are just several similar reports for the Z-scheme design combined with plasmon-active noble metal nanostructures.59,60 Even in reported cases, the role of noble metals coupled with Z-scheme design is mainly attributed to charge mediation, without significant attention to the plasmon-induced activation of photoinduced chemical transformation. To fill this gap in the design of a Z-scheme for OWS, we proposed and investigated the coupling of II-type semiconductors with a plasmon active periodical Au grating for light-induced OWS (Fig. 1). Our design is in fact close to the so-called artificial leaf,61,62 which allows water splitting on the surface of the specifically designed substrates. As a Z-scheme material, we used the previously reported combination of 2D WO3 flakes and CdS quantum dots.63,64 The ratio of WO3 to CdS was adjusted according to a previous report52 and its optimality was additionally verified (Fig. S1†). The proposed combination of WO3 and CdS provides sufficient energy for the generation of charge carriers for OWS and has suitable positions of valence and conduction bands for OER and HER half-reactions as well as suitable reaction sites in the structure of both materials (unsaturated coordination bonds of W atoms at the edges of the flakes, responsible for OER and sulphur-related reaction sites in CdS, responsible for HER).65–69 However, the WO3–CdS Z-scheme suffers from imperfect light absorption and also a high degree of charge recombination. To increase the light absorption of the overall structure (especially at longer wavelengths) and to accelerate the charge carriers for their recombination reduction, we coupled the Z-scheme with the plasmon active periodical gold grating. The grating substrate could support the excitation and propagation of SPP waves70 due to efficient light absorption at longer wavelengths and effective plasmon triggering of surrounding materials to a distance of up to tens of nm. In turn, the excitation of SPP on the grating surface results in light focusing with sub-diffraction limit and in turn a related gigantic concentration of the local electric field. As a result, WO3–CdS are triggered by the high value of the plasmon-related electric field, which can induce electron–hole excitation and separation and in this way facilitate charge transfer through the water/Z-scheme interface.

Creation of Z-scheme coupled with a plasmon-active grating
The preparation of an SPP-supported Au grating and coupled WO3–CdS is described in detail in ESI.† Briefly, according to the zeta potential measurements (see Fig. S2†), the surface of WO3 nanoflakes is negatively charged at pH = 7. This makes it possible to attach positively charged cadmium ions followed by the attachment of sulphur anions and the creation of a II-type-coupled WO3–CdS Z-scheme. Thin Au films were deposited on the periodically patterned polymer template using a magnetron sputtering system for the preparation of an SPP active Au grating. The TEM images of initially created WO3 flakes are shown in Fig. S3,† where their lateral size in the 100–150 nm range is well evident. The thickness of flakes was estimated from AFM measurements after the flake deposition on the flat Si surfaces (Fig. 2A). We performed several measurements on randomly selected 20 flakes and the calculated average thickness was 3.8 ± 0.5 nm. WO3–CdS were also subjected to AFM examination and a conservation of averaged thickness as well as the appearance of additional features (i.e. CdS nanostructures) on the flake surface was observed.

The structure and composition of WO3–CdS-coupled semiconductors were further confirmed by XPS, XRD, TEM, Raman, and HRTEM-EDX techniques. TEM measurements indicate the conservation of the overall flake structure after the CdS surface-assisted preparation (Fig. 2Bvs. S3†). Additional HRTEM images (Fig. S4†) allow the estimation of the size distribution of created CdS, which was found to lie within the 4–9 nm range (Fig. S5†). The results of XPS (Fig. S6†) indicate the appearance of characteristic Cd and S peaks after the CdS synthesis on the WO3 flake surface. In addition, the apparent change in the 4d5/2 and 4d3/2 W band ratio reveals the interaction of W and Cd atoms (Fig. S6B†). The XRD signal from CdS in the WO3–CdS-coupled structure was not much pronounced as the high crystallinity of initial WO3 obscured the response from CdS (Fig. S7†). Nevertheless, we observed some additional peaks from CdS located at 33°. Similar results were obtained in the case of Raman spectroscopy (or SERS), where an additional band affiliated with CdS but with lower intensity was also found (Fig. S8†). On the other hand, the results of HRTEM measurements clearly indicate that the CdS nanostructures have a crystalline nature, which is a necessary condition for the “right” positioning of the valence and conductive bands, hence, important for the correct Z-scheme design (Fig. 2C). The HRTEM-EDX mapping indicates that the CdS nanostructures are formed on the part of the WO3 flake surface. In particular, they are found on both the flake edges and basal plane, but partially leaving the WO3 surface non-screened, i.e. chemically available. Such material distribution is favorable for the right Z-scheme functionality as both semiconductor surfaces should be available for HER and OER half-reactions in the OWS process.
The main goal of the Au grating was to support efficient SPP wave excitation and propagation, ensuring the nanostructure ordering and optimal structure parameters. The regularity of the grating was confirmed by AFM measurements (Fig. S9A†). The optimization of grating parameters for the strongest and homogeneous plasmon excitation across the grating surface is described in ESI (Fig. S9B and C† and related discussion). Efficient excitation of SPP on the grating surface is well evident from UV-Vis absorption spectra with a pronounced plasmon absorption band located between wavelengths 600 and 900 nm (Fig. 3A). In turn, the “strength” of SPP manifests itself as a significant increase of the surface-enhanced Raman response of the probe analyte (R6G) deposited on a grating surface (see Fig. S9C†). In the next step, we performed the deposition of WO3–CdS structures on the grating surface. Deposition parameters were chosen to achieve a dense covering of the grating surface by flakes, which in turn ensure the maximal effectivity of plasmon triggering of the Z-scheme. The impact of flake deposition on the optical properties of the grating is demonstrated in Fig. 3A, from which the conservation of the SPP absorption band and increase in absorbance at wavelengths below 500 nm (intrinsic absorption of WO3–CdS flakes) is evident. The deposited flakes appear as additional morphological features on the Au grating surface (Fig. 3Bvs. S9A†). The optimal distribution of flakes (optimization route is described in the ESI Fig. S10 and S11† and related discussion) is presented in Fig. 3. In this case, the overall flake coverage was estimated to be close to formation of a 3–5 flake bundle (SI for detail). Additional Raman (1 × 1 cm2 surface area) and EDX (200 × 200 μm2 surface area) mappings confirm the homogeneous covering of the grating surface by WO3–CdS flakes (Fig. 3C and D). Such sample flake distribution ensure that the grating surface is completely covered by the redox-active material, while the relatively thin flake layer makes possible their efficient triggering by SPP waves (i.e. avoiding the screening of plasmon related electric field at the material-electrolyte surface by neighboring flakes).

Plasmon triggering for Z-scheme efficiency: photo electrochemical case
In the next step, the impact of plasmon and photo-triggering on the Z-scheme catalytic efficiency is investigated. For this purpose, electrochemical measurements, including HER and OER models, as well as impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed in the dark or under illumination with various wavelengths. It should be noted that the results do not prove the material ability for the solely sunlight-induced OWS, but they shed light on the effect of material photo- or plasmon-induced triggering on the catalytic activity. First, we found the wavelength suitable for the material triggering, using UV-Vis spectroscopy (Fig. 3A). As is evident, WO3 absorbs light with wavelengths below 500 nm. Coupling WO3 with CdS nanostructures results in the absorption enhancement and appearance of the characteristic absorption shoulder for the CdS quantum dots near 480 nm. Absorption enhancement at this wavelength is expected as both materials have a similar value for the forbidden gap.71 The pristine grating has a broad SPP absorption band located between 600 and 900 nm, but its absorption below 500 nm is weak. However, the deposition of WO3–CdS on the grating surface results in an apparent light absorption increase at shorter wavelengths. Thus, in comparison with simple WO3–CdS, the absorption of WO3–CdS/Au samples overlaps much better with the sunlight spectrum. Indeed, the part of the sunlight spectrum between 500 and 600 nm remains unused in the light-induced OWS. On the other hand, most of the previously reported materials utilize wavelengths below 500 nm and we believe that even a small improvement in the longer wavelength utilization (in our case) is remarkable.
The results of electrochemical measurements are presented in Fig. 4. As is evident, light illumination has a significant impact on the LSV curves of both OER and HER models (Fig. 4A and B). In particular, the utilization of lower wavelength (405 nm) illumination leads to a decrease in both HER and OER overpotentials (measured at 25 mA cm−2 current density). The decrease is due to the creation of electron–hole pairs and enhancement in the charge carrier density, responsible for both reactions. We also observed a similar phenomenon in the case of pristine WO3 flakes deposited on a non-plasmonic surface (OER half-reaction), but the effect was less pronounced than that in the case of WO3–CdS-coupled semiconductors (Fig. S12†). Illumination of WO3–CdS/Au with wavelengths corresponding to SPP absorption bands (730, 780, and 850 nm) leads to a similar but even more pronounced decrease in the overpotentials of both the half-reactions. This finding confirms the fact that plasmon triggering can efficiently contribute to the electron–hole pair generation and charge migration, facilitating the activity of the surface catalytic centers. On the other hand, illumination with wavelengths that are not absorbed by WO3–CdS or plasmon-active grating (in particular, 530 nm and partially 630 nm, which falls in the SPP tail) does not affect the LSV curves. In the next step, we performed the photo-triggering of the WO3–CdS/Au structure with both wavelengths, corresponding to the absorption bands of WO3–CdS (405 nm) and SPP excitation on the Au grating surface (730 nm). The results presented in Fig. 4A and B show a higher decrease in both HER and OER overpotentials (corresponding values are given in Fig. 4A and B insets). Thus, the inner photoexcitation of redox active charges in the Z-scheme can further be enhanced by external plasmon triggering, which can also be realized under illumination with a broad sunlight spectrum.
 Fig. 4  (A) and (B) HER and OER half-reactions, measured in the LSV mode as a function of sample (Au/WO3–CdS) illumination at various wavelengths, (C) EIS spectra, measured on Au/WO3–CdS in darkness or under illumination at various wavelengths, and (D) and (E) time resolved chronoamperometry measurements, performed at HER and OER potentials, respectively. 
The EIS curves measured as a function of illumination wavelength are presented in Fig. 4C. The apparent decrease in EIS semicircles under illumination with light of wavelengths corresponding to WO3–CdS absorption or SPP excitation is observed. Interestingly, the plasmon triggering has a slightly more pronounced impact, which indicates that the interface charge transfer resistance (i.e. semicircle radius) decreases more significantly under the impact of the plasmon-related electric field. Simultaneous double wavelength illumination results in the pronounced decrease of the charge transfer resistance between the Au/WO3–CdS surface and the surrounding electrolyte. The decrease is probably due to the overall increase of charge carrier concentration and their acceleration by plasmonic evanescent waves or the local plasmon heating phenomenon. Finally, from the EIS curves (the gap between the beginning of EIS curves and zero on the x-axis), the resistivity of the solution was estimated (as well as the effect of illumination). In our case, this value was found in the 29–31 Ohm range and did not depend on the illumination of the sample. Thus, the observed decrease in EIS semicircles is attributed solely to the decrease in the interface charge transfer resistance due to created electrode illumination.
Finally, Fig. 4D and E represent the chronoamperometry measurements, starting at darkness and continuously monitored after switching the LED ON (two “main” wavelengths were chosen). In both water splitting half-reactions, we observed an apparent increase in the HER and OER reaction rates after the light switching. Moreover, mere SPP triggering (730 nm illumination) leads to more pronounced effects in both HER and OER cases. Interestingly, the application of simultaneous double wavelength illumination leads to an even higher current increase (by factors 2.5 and 3.3 for HER and OER respectively). Apparently, in this case a synergetic effect is observed when the electron–hole pairs generated under 405 nm illumination are additionally separated/accelerated by the SPP electric field. Another interesting feature, observed from the chronoamperometry measurements, is the different response time of OER and HER to the start of illumination. In particular, the light triggering of HER half-reaction leads to a gradual and relatively “slow” increase in electric current. Such sample response, within the time scale of tens of seconds, can be explained by apparent contribution of plasmon-heating (Fig. S13†). Conversely, OER half-reaction shows an immediate response on light triggering (especially pronounced in the case of the use of double wavelengths). Such response kinetics may be related to charge carrier generation and their acceleration. Thus, from the results of electrochemical measurements we can conclude that double-wavelengths illumination of Au/WO3–CdS can result in the synergistic triggering of its redox activity.
Solely sunlight induced water splitting
In the next step, we proceed to the examination of solely light-induced hydrogen and oxygen generation in the OWS process. First, we used different LED sources with the aim to estimate the impact of different wavelengths on the amount of produced oxygen and hydrogen for WO3–CdS and WO3–CdS/Au samples (Fig. 5A and S14†). The illumination of the WO3–CdS Z-scheme with a shorter wavelength leads to OWS, independently on the neighboring substrate (Au grating or carbon – Fig S14†). This result was expected as the possibility of water splitting using the WO3–CdS Z-scheme has already been demonstrated previously.72,73 As reported above, the illumination of the WO3–CdS Z-scheme with shorter wavelength leads to OWS, independently on the neighboring substrate (Au grating or carbon – Fig S14†). The produced amounts of hydrogen and oxygen are slightly non-stoichiometric (the “missing” oxygen can be attributed to a partial sulphur oxidation71). The utilization of longer wavelengths does not lead to OWS in the case of WO3–CdS flakes deposited on a non-plasmonic substrate (Fig. S14B†). However, the utilization of the neighboring Au grating and related SPP triggering of WO3–CdS lead to apparent OWS with the production of reasonable amounts of hydrogen and oxygen, which is even higher than those in the previous case of WO3–CdS flake triggering by 405 nm (Fig. 5A). Thus, the utilization of plasmonic supports makes possible the use of low energy NIR photons, which are not sufficient for the common OWS process. We also performed the double wavelength illumination of the WO3–CdS/Au system and observed a significant increase in the produced hydrogen amount, indicating that the photo- and plasmon triggering of the Z-scheme by photons of different wavelengths is very effective (Fig. 5A). Apparently, the simultaneous triggering of the Z-scheme at double wavelengths works in synergy, expanding in this way both the useful wavelength range and overall OWS efficiency.
 Fig. 5  (A) The amounts of hydrogen and oxygen, produced through overall water splitting by solely light illumination on the Au/WO3–CdS surface during 12 h, and (B) the several subsequent cycles of overall water splitting under the simulated sunlight illumination of the Au/WO3–CdS surface. 
Finally, we performed a range of OWS experiments under simulated sunlight (1 sun) with the aim of estimating hydrogen and oxygen evolution on the pristine Au grating, WO3–CdS flakes deposited on dielectric substrates, and WO3–CdS/Au samples (Fig. S14A† and 5B). As expected, the illumination of the Au grating does not lead to OWS (Fig. S14A†). Hydrogen and oxygen evolutions were observed in the case of WO3–CdS flakes on a non-plasmonic substrate, in accordance with previous reports.63,64 Triggering the Z-scheme, consisting of WO3–CdS deposited on the plasmon active grating, by simulated sunlight results in an increase in the produced hydrogen amount by one order of magnitude (Fig. S14A†). We observed some deviations from the stoichiometric amounts of evolved hydrogen and oxygen (Fig. 5B), which can also be attributed to partial sulphur oxidation. On the other hand, the proposed structure was tested for 30 h in 3 subsequent cycles, and only a slight decrease in the hydrogen production due to sulphur oxidation (see the slope of hydrogen concentration in Fig. 5B) was observed, indicating the appropriate stability level of the proposed WO3–CdS system. Additional characterizations performed after stability tests indicate the absence of dissolved WO3–CdS, and also confirms the partial sulphur oxidation (Fig. S15†). The above described results convincingly demonstrate that the utilization of plasmon triggering could efficiently solve actual problems in the field of solely light-induced OWS. In particular, it increases the overall efficiency of hydrogen production and makes the use of longer wavelengths (up to the NIR part of the solar spectrum) possible.
We also compared the efficiency of our system with the actual published ones (Table 1).33,42,74–85 All recent results, presented in Table 1, utilize the Z-scheme design for OWS, but they can conditionally be divided into two main groups – with74–80 or without33,42,81–85 the use of sacrificial agents. As is evident, in the latter case, the proposed plasmon-assisted triggering of Z-scheme efficiency is especially favorable as the utilization of plasmon triggering allows achieving very reasonable hydrogen production and sufficient increase in the STH value in comparison with the most of the previously published schemes.33,42,81–85 On the other hand, commonly reported schemes involving sacrificial agents are able to achieve even higher hydrogen production. In our case, we can also increase the efficiency of water splitting by the addition of sacrificial agents (Fig. S16†). However, this approach has some drawbacks, reducing the attractiveness of the process. In particular, in this case, the sacrificial agents are commonly consumed during water splitting. For this reason, we focused our study on the improvement of artificial-agent free OWS and demonstrated that the plasmon assistance allows the increased use of sunlight spectrum, while the synergy in photo- and plasmon triggering of the Z-scheme sufficiently enhances the process efficiency. The authors believe that the present study moves the sunlight assisted water splitting closer to practical realization.

Conclusion
In this work, we propose the plasmon triggering of Z-scheme-coupled semiconductors for efficient and solely sunlight-induced OWS. Similar to an artificial leaf, a sample design was realized through the coupling of commonly used semiconductors with a plasmon active Au grating. WO3 was prepared in the form of 2D flakes and the synthesis of CdS quantum dots was performed directly on the surface of the flakes. The created material was able to induce water splitting under illumination close to the UV light spectrum, but it was insensitive to longer wavelengths. The plasmonic grating, created by the deposition of a thin gold layer on the periodically patterned surface, was able to support SPP excitation under illumination with light close to the NIR wavelength. The coupling of the plasmon active grating and Z-scheme allows the utilization of plasmon assistance for the efficient triggering of WO3–CdS activity in the solely light-induced water splitting and production of a significant amount of hydrogen (and oxygen) under illumination with the light of longer wavelengths. SPP triggering effectively increases the catalytic activity of the closed WO3–CdS through efficient electron and hole generation and separation, both promoting interface charge transfer from the Z-scheme to water with clear contribution from plasmon heating. As a result, the coupling of WO3–CdS flakes with the plasmonic surface and subsequent double wavelength illumination (or broad light spectrum utilization) increases the overall structure efficiency by one order of magnitude, indicating that direct Z-scheme photoexcitation and its plasmonic triggering work synergistically. Thus, our work demonstrates how the efficient plasmon triggering of Z-scheme materials in OWS may lead to reasonable hydrogen production without the necessity of sacrificial agents and with a broader part utilization of the solar spectrum.
