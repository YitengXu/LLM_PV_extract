    , Accepted 23rd August 2018First published on 24th August 2018AbstractNanomaterials with ABX3-type perovskite structure have attracted considerable and increasing attention due to their unique physical and chemical properties as well as promising applications in various fields. In this work, we have developed a simple electrospinning followed by a calcination process to prepare ABO3-type perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers as efficient oxidase mimics for the detection of L-cysteine. The oxidase-like catalytic activity of the prepared LaMnO3+δ nanofibers is heavily dependent on the calcination temperature which results in different sizes of the LaMnO3+δ crystals and their crystallinity, and the maximum activity is achieved at the calcination temperature of 700 °C. Based on the high oxidase-like catalytic activity of the as-prepared perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers, a simple and accurate colorimetric detection method towards L-cysteine has been developed. The detection limit is as low as 109.8 nM and an excellent selectivity for L-cysteine detection with common substances in human blood as interferents is also achieved. In addition, the LaMnO3+δ nanofibers can be retained as a monolithic membrane after the calcination process, making them an oxidase mimic for on-demand colorimetric sensing. This work reveals the promising prospects for the perovskite LaMnO3+δ materials in biosensing, medical diagnosis, food safety and environmental monitoring.
Introduction
Over the past few years, functional materials with an ABX3-type perovskite structure have attracted extensive attention due to their unique physical and chemical properties, as well as promising applications in a large variety of fields, such as solar cells,1,2 light emitting diodes (LED),3 lasers,4 photocatalysis,5–7 gas or humidity sensors,8,9 electrocatalysis etc.10–12 Recently, perovskite-type oxides (ABO3), e.g. LaNiO3 and LaCoO3, have been reported to serve as peroxidase-like nanozymes, which can be applied in analytical fields.13,14 However, it is necessary to introduce H2O2 into a peroxidase-like catalytic reaction system, resulting in both environmental pollution and poor sensitivity analysis. Therefore, oxidase mimics have drawn more and more attention and are considered as appropriate substitutes for peroxidase mimics due to their free usage of H2O2. Recently, some nanomaterials, including manganese oxides, Fe nanoparticles embedded in an N-rich porous carbon, MnCo2O4 nanotubes, CoOOH nanosheets and sulfate ion-treated CeO2 nanorods, have been demonstrated to possess intrinsic oxidase-like catalytic activity.15–19 However, there are no reports on the fabrication of ABO3-type perovskite nanomaterials serving as oxidase mimics to date. LaMnO3 is a typical ABO3-type perovskite oxide, where B sites are usually occupied by a transition metal serving as the main active component to decide the catalytic activity, while A sites are correspondingly occupied by a rare-earth metal to stabilize the crystal structure by controlling the valence state and decentralized state of the B sites.20 Based on such a ABO3-type perovskite structure under the existence of tunable valence states of element Mn and oxygen vacancies, LaMnO3+δ has been proved to possess some particular catalytic properties, such as catalyzing the oxidation of vinyl chloride, catalyzing the oxidation of CO and electrocatalyzing the oxidation of fructose.20–22 But the discovery of perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanomaterials with oxidase-like catalytic activity is still of great value, considering their further practical applications.
Among various types of perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanomaterials, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructured materials, including nanorods, nanotubes, nanobelts and nanofibers show superior catalytic, electrical, optical, magnetic, thermal and gas sensing properties due to their large surface to volume ratio, low density and excellent charge transfer properties.23,24 Most importantly, the 1D nanostructured materials can be textured or self-assembled into a free-standing membrane, which shows broad applications in the fields of filtration, nanodevice fabrication, catalysis, the environment, energy storage and conversion.25–27 In the past few decades, a large variety of strategies have been developed to fabricate 1D nanostructured materials. Among these approaches, the electrospinning technique is a simple, versatile and low-cost route to prepare textured polymeric and ceramic nanofibers with tunable diameters, compositions and morphologies.28 Considering that few articles have reported on the fabrication of a ceramic nanofibrous membrane with a single component, the synthesis of a flexible perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibrous membrane with oxidase-like catalytic activity should be highlighted.

L-Cysteine is an important amino acid in biological fluids, which plays a crucial role in living systems. It has been found that abnormal levels of L-cysteine are associated with slow growth in children, depigmentation of hair, skin lesions, liver damage, and even cancers.29–31 Therefore, the determination of L-cysteine concentration in physiological samples is of great importance in physical examination and clinical diagnosis.32 So far, a large number of technical methods have been developed to detect L-cysteine, including the electrochemical technique,31 fluorescence spectroscopy,33 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),34 chemiluminescence,35 gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.36 However, these aforementioned approaches exhibit some certain shortcomings, such as high cost, complex and time-consuming procedures, as well as the requirement of sophisticated instruments and skilled personnel. Compared to these techniques, the colorimetric sensing approach offers many promising advantages, including low cost, high sensitivity and selectivity, and easy operation, which circumvents the aforementioned limitations.37,38 Recently, the oxidase-like catalytic reaction system has served as a typical colorimetric chemosensor for the detection of L-cysteine, showing promising prospects in bioscience and biotechnology.19,39
Supported by the above reports, in this study, we have reported the preparation of perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers as oxidase mimics for the sensitive detection of L-cysteine via a simple and effective electrospinning followed by a calcination process. The oxidase-like catalytic activity is heavily dependent on the size and crystallinity of the LaMnO3+δ crystals in the nanofibers. Based on the superior oxidase-like activity of the LaMnO3+δ nanofibers, we have developed a simple colorimetric approach with high sensitivity and terrific selectivity to detect L-cysteine. In addition, the characteristics of a flexible free-standing membrane of the LaMnO3+δ nanofibers make the membrane itself a promising candidate as a monolithic oxidase mimic for on-demand colorimetric sensing, which presents great potential applications in biocatalysis, environmental monitoring and medical diagnosis.
Experimental
Chemicals and materials
Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 1300 000 g mol−1), L-cysteine and dihydroethidium (DHE) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Manganese acetate tetrahydrate (C4H6MnO4·4H2O) was commercially obtained from Tianjin East China Reagent Factory. Lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (La(NO3)3·6H2O) was bought from Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute. 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co., Ltd. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) was bought from Tianjin Tiantai Fine Chemicals Co., Ltd. Anhydrous sodium acetate (NaAc) was obtained from Xilong Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Furthermore, sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), acetic acid and isopropyl alcohol were commercially obtained from Beijing Chemical Works. All of the chemicals mentioned above were of analytical reagent grade and were used without further purification. Deionized water was used throughout the whole experiment.
Preparation of LaMnO3+δ nanofibers via electrospinning followed by a calcination process
In a typical experiment, 0.5413 g of La(NO3)3·6H2O and 0.3064 g of Mn(Ac)2·4H2O were dissolved in a mixed solvent consisting of DMF (4.5 mL) and isopropyl alcohol (4.5 mL), followed by a 4 h vigorous stirring process to ensure that the inorganic salts were dissolved completely. Then 0.5272 g of PVP was added into the mixed solution mentioned above and stirred vigorously for about 18 h to generate a homogeneous viscous solution. After that, this homogeneous viscous solution was used as a precursor for the following electrospinning process. During the electrospinning process, the precursor was pumped into a thin glassy nozzle connected with a high-voltage power supply kept at 18 kV. An aluminum foil collector serving as the other electrode was about 20 cm away from the nozzle. Then the obtained nanofiber membrane was transferred into a Muffle furnace. Subsequently, the nanofiber membranes obtained through the aforementioned processes were calcined at 600 °C, 700 °C, 800 °C and 900 °C for 2 h under an air atmosphere, respectively, resulting in the production of LaMnO3+δ nanofibers.
Investigation of the oxidase-like catalytic activity of the LaMnO3+δ nanofibers
The oxidase-like catalytic activity of the as-synthesized LaMnO3+δ nanofibers was characterized through a typical catalytic reaction model towards the oxidation of TMB. In a typical colorimetric experiment, 20 μL of TMB solution (15 mM in DMSO) serving as an oxidase substrate was added into 3.0 mL acetate buffer solution (pH = 4) in a spectrophotometer cell, followed by the injection of 20 μL of catalyst suspension (3 mg mL−1). After a quick shaking, the obtained uniform solution was examined via monitoring the absorbance at 651 nm after 10 min reaction to detect the oxidation of TMB through UV-vis spectrophotometry.
Steady-state kinetics experiment
In order to measure the steady-state kinetics of the LaMnO3+δ nanofibers as oxidase mimics, 20 μL of TMB dissolved in DMSO with varied concentrations was added into 3.0 mL acetate buffer solution (pH = 4) in a spectrophotometer cell, followed by the injection of 20 μL of catalyst suspension with a constant concentration (3 mg mL−1). After a quick shaking, the initial oxidation reaction velocity of TMB was obtained by monitoring the absorbance at 651 nm for 1 min in the time course of a UV-vis spectrophotometer and calculating the obtained spectrum data. The kinetic parameters, [Km] and [Vmax], were calculated by the Lineweaver–Burk plot which is derived from the Michaelis–Menten equation, shown as 1/ν = Km/Vmax·(1/[S] + 1/Km), where ν is the initial reaction velocity, Km is the Michaelis constant, Vmax is the maximal initial reaction velocity, and [S] is the substrate concentration.
Detection of L-cysteine
A colorimetric method is developed to detect L-cysteine. In a typical procedure, 20 μL of L-cysteine with various concentrations (0–75 mM) was added into a 3.0 mL acetate buffer solution (pH = 4) containing 20 μL of TMB solution (15 mM in DMSO), followed by the injection of 20 μL of catalyst suspension (3 mg mL−1). After rapid shaking, the corresponding absorption variations at 651 nm after 10 min reaction were recorded via the spectrum mode of a UV-vis spectrophotometer.
Oxidase-like on-demand colorimetric sensing
Based on the flexibility of the as-prepared LaMnO3+δ nanofiber membrane, the oxidase-like on-demand colorimetric sensor was prepared and tested. The as-prepared LaMnO3+δ nanofiber membrane calcined at 700 °C was cut with scissors into a 1 cm × 0.8 cm membrane serving as the on-demand colorimetric sensor. After the reaction solution containing 12.0 mL acetate buffer solution (pH = 4) with 80 μL of TMB solution (15 mM in DMSO) was prepared, the membrane sensor was put into or taken out from this reaction solution with a tiny pair of tweezers every 6 min and the total test time was set as 30 min. During the whole period of the test, the reaction solution was examined via monitoring the absorbance at 651 nm every 2 min to detect the oxidation variation of TMB through UV-vis spectrophotometry.
Characterization
The morphology of the as-prepared LaMnO3+δ nanofiber materials was characterized through field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Nova NanoSEM) operated at 15 kV and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-1200 EX) operated at 80 kV. A FEI Tecnai G2 F20 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) was used to obtain typical HRTEM images and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. The crystallographic structure of the as-synthesized perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers was investigated via X-ray diffractometer measurements (PAN-alytical B.V. Empyrean) with Cu-Kα radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) (Thermo Scientific ESCALAB250) were used to evaluate the chemical compositions of the as-synthesized material sample. In order to detect the oxidase-like catalytic property of the as-prepared perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofiber materials, UV-vis spectra tests were performed on a Shimadzu 2501 PC spectrometer.
Results and discussion
The fabrication of LaMnO3+δ nanofibers mainly involves two steps. First, the PVP/La(NO3)3/Mn(Ac)2 nanofiber membrane was prepared through an electrospinning technique. Second, the as-prepared membrane was calcined in an air atmosphere to produce a LaMnO3+δ nanofiber membrane. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows a typical SEM image of PVP/La(NO3)3/Mn(Ac)2 nanofibers, showing a random orientation and smooth surfaces with the diameters ranging from 250 to 680 nm. After calcination, as shown in Fig. 1, the as-synthesized LaMnO3+δ nanofibers shrank to a size ranging from 170 to 370 nm, which can be ascribed to the decomposition of PVP. Furthermore, although the calcination temperatures are high, the LaMnO3+δ nanofibers maintain their original fibrous morphology as well as uniformity and continuity, which can explicate the flexibility of the as-prepared LaMnO3+δ nanofiber membrane. The TEM images of the as-prepared LaMnO3+δ nanofibers calcined at different temperatures are shown in the inset of Fig. 1. It can be easily found that the morphologies of the LaMnO3+δ nanofibers are highly dependent on the calcination temperature. When the calcination temperature increases from 600 to 900 °C, the diameters of the LaMnO3+δ nanofibers decrease correspondingly from 300 nm to around 170 nm. In addition, the surfaces of the LaMnO3+δ nanofibers become rougher slightly corresponding to the increment of calcination temperature, which indicates a gradual increment of LaMnO3+δ crystal size.21

In order to characterize the crystal structure of the as-synthesized perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers, the XRD measurement was analysed. As shown in Fig. 2, all the diffraction peaks of the as-synthesized perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers calcined at 700 °C, 800 °C or 900 °C are conspicuous and consistent with the standard XRD pattern of JCPDS card no. 50-0298 without any impure peaks, demonstrating that the as-synthesized materials are LaMnO3.15 nanofibers with high purity. Several characteristic peaks appear at 23.0°, 32.8°, 40.2°, 47.0°, 52.6°, 58.2°, 68.7° and 77.9°, matching well with the crystal planes (012), (110), (202), (024), (122), (214), (208) and (134) of perovskite LaMnO3.15 nanofibers, respectively. Furthermore, we have evaluated the crystal size of LaMnO3.15 in the nanofibers via the Scherrer equation (Dhkl = kλ × 57.3/βcosθ), giving an average crystal size of approximately 17.8, 19.9, and 22.2 nm at calcination temperatures of 700 °C, 800 °C and 900 °C, respectively. This result demonstrates the increment of the LaMnO3.15 crystal size with the increased calcination temperatures.38

To further clarify the crystal structure of the LaMnO3+δ nanofibers, a HRTEM test was performed. As shown in Fig. 3a, a distinct lattice fringe space of 0.275 nm was observed, corresponding to the (110) facet of perovskite LaMnO3.15 (JCPDS card no. 50-0298). The SAED pattern in Fig. 3b also demonstrates the existence of the (110) and (202) facets of perovskite LaMnO3.15 (JCPDS card no. 50-0298). A typical EDX spectrum of the as-synthesized materials is exhibited in Fig. 3c, in which the signals of La, Mn and O elements can be clearly observed. The presence of La, Mn and O elements provides supplemental evidence for the formation of the as-synthesized perovskite LaMnO3+δ materials. It is necessary to point out that the signals of C, Si and Cu are attributed to the carbon-coated copper grid and the instrument substrate used for the EDX test. Furthermore, the elemental mapping analysis in Fig. 3d–g suggests the uniform distribution of La, Mn and O elements, further proving the formation of the LaMnO3+δ nanofibers.

To further study the chemical composition and the valence states of the as-synthesized perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers, XPS measurements were carried out (Fig. 4a). As shown in Fig. 4b, in regard to the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers obtained at 700 °C, the characteristic signals at 834.7 and 838.3 eV originate from La 3d5/2. In addition, the signals located at 851.4 and 855.3 eV belong to La 3d3/2.40Fig. 4c illustrates the fine XPS spectrum of Mn 2p, and it can be clearly observed that there are two typical peaks emerging at 642.3 and 653.5 eV attributed to Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2, respectively.41 Moreover, it should be noted that the shape of the peak at 642.3 eV is asymmetric because Mn4+ coexists with Mn3+. Therefore, oxygen vacancies are bound to exist in LaMnO3+δ crystals, otherwise the electrically neutral property of the system cannot be maintained.40 Furthermore, a curve fitting method was used to identify four different kinds of species of O component, which is shown in Fig. 4d. The peak with the most intensity at the lowest binding energy at 529.6 eV is attributed to lattice oxygen (Olatt: O2−), while the peak at the highest binding energy at 532.9 eV is ascribed to adsorbed molecular water (H2Oads). Two peaks of surface adsorbed oxygen species (Oads) appear at 530.5 and 531.7 eV, corresponding to adsorbed oxygen (Oads(O−/O22−)) and oxygen-containing groups such as hydroxyl (OH−) and/or carbonate (CO32−) in the form of surface adsorbates (Oads(OH−/CO32−)), respectively.22 It is necessary to emphasize that these adsorbed oxygen species make the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers active in oxidase-like catalytic reactions.

It is well known that manganese compounds, such as MnO2 nanosheets, Mn3O4 nanoparticals and hollow MnCo2O4 nanofibers, have been found to possess oxidase-like catalytic activities.19,42,43 Due to the special redox cycle (Mn4+ + e− ↔ Mn3+) forming and demolishing oxygen vacancies, the as-synthesized perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers are excellent candidates for oxidase mimicking. In this work, a typical catalytic reaction towards the oxidation of TMB is used to evaluate the oxidase-like activity of the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers. Fig. 5a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of different systems. It is revealed that TMB can be oxidized to generate a blue colour and a characteristic absorption peak at 651 nm with the existence of the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofiber catalyst, which is attributed to the formation of a blue charge transfer complex and a radical cation of TMB (TMB+), demonstrating the oxidase-like property of the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers.38,44 It can be clearly seen in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and Fig. 5b that the catalytic activity depends on pH values, and the maximum absorbance at 651 nm is achieved at pH = 4. Therefore, the buffer solution of pH = 4 was chosen to apply to all the subsequent UV-vis spectrum measurements. The influence of the temperature on the oxidase-like activity of perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers has also been evaluated (Fig. S3, ESI†). A temperature-dependent oxidase-like activity of the LaMnO3+δ nanofibers was achieved, and the highest oxidase-like activity is observed at a temperature of around 30 °C. Fig. 5c exhibits the oxidase-like catalytic activity of the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers calcined at different temperatures. Among four typical curves, the one under the calcination temperature at 700 °C possesses the maximum absorbance value at 651 nm, suggesting that the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers calcined at 700 °C possess the best oxidase-like catalytic activity. The oxidase-like activity of the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers is heavily dependent on the size of the LaMnO3+δ crystals and their crystallinity. The high crystallinity and the small size of the LaMnO3+δ crystals are beneficial for the oxidase-like catalytic activity.38 In this study, the low catalytic activity of the LaMnO3+δ nanofibers calcined at 600 °C can be ascribed to their poor crystallinity, which has been proved via the XRD result. Furthermore, with the continued increment of the temperature, the size of the LaMnO3+δ crystals becomes the main influencing factor towards the oxidase-like catalytic activity. Therefore, the oxidase-like catalytic activity of the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers obviously decreases when the calcination temperature is enhanced from 700 to 900 °C, which can be attributed to the increment of the LaMnO3+δ crystal size. This result has also been proved by the XRD patterns. Therefore, the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers calcined at 700 °C show the best oxidase-like catalytic activity. Furthermore, we have evaluated the usage stability of the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofiber oxidase mimics. It is found that the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers still retain more than 94% of their initial catalytic activity within the storage period of 10 days in aqueous solution under ambient conditions, demonstrating their excellent usage stability, which is much better than that of the previously reported natural enzymes (Fig. S4, ESI†).

The catalyst here refers to the as-synthesized perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers calcined at 700 °C. 
Traditionally, it is well known that H2O2 is indispensible in peroxidase-like catalytic reaction systems to generate hydroxyl radicals to catalyse the oxidation of the peroxidase substrates.45,46 However, the oxidase-like catalytic reaction systems comprise just catalysts and oxidase substrates. According to the literature, it is regarded that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are responsible for the oxidase-like catalytic activity.47–49 Considering that sulfite can react with the ROS and inhibit the oxidation of TMB, sodium sulfite was added into the oxidase-like catalytic reaction system as a radical inhibitor to further study the oxidase-like catalytic mechanism of the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers.50 As shown in Fig. 5d, in the absence of sulfite, a typical absorption peak appears at 651 nm and the reaction system displays a blue colour, both of which are attributed to the oxidation of TMB. In contrast, after the addition of sodium sulfite, no absorption peak at 651 nm is observed and the reaction system remains colourless because the oxidation of TMB has been totally inhibited by the sulfite. Based on the XPS results towards the spectra of Mn and O elements, a plausible reaction mechanism on the basis of the redox cycle between Mn4+ and Mn3+ ions of the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers has been demonstrated, which is exhibited in Fig. 6. Firstly, the oxygen from the gas phase that is dissolved in the reaction solution can be activated by oxygen vacancies ([VO]) simultaneously with the oxidation of Mn3+ into Mn4+. In the following, the release of O* (O* denotes ROS) can be achieved via the process formulated as 2Mn4+ + O2− → 2Mn3+[VO] + O*, in which the activation and migration of surface oxygen chemically adsorbed on the catalysts are implemented through oxygen vacancies in the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers.22 Fig. S5 (ESI†) further proves the generation of ROS via using DHE as specific fluorescence probes. An obvious fluorescence emission peak at 610 nm appears after the addition of DHE into the oxidase-like reaction system, confirming the formation of ROS.51,52 Finally, the released ROS reacts with TMB molecules on the surface of the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers to catalyse the oxidation of TMB and produce a blue colour in the oxidase-like catalytic reaction system, which is similar to the case in other reaction systems.19,22
 Fig. 6  Schematic illustration of the mechanism for the oxidase-like catalytic reaction towards the oxidation of TMB. 
To further study the oxidase-like catalytic efficiency of the as-synthesized perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers, a steady-state kinetic experiment was performed. A set of initial reaction rates were obtained under the condition where the concentration of the oxidase mimics was fixed while the concentration of TMB acted as the only variable within a specific range. As shown in Fig. 7, the data were fitted to the Michaelis–Menten equation formulated as 1/ν = Km/Vmax × (1/[S] + 1/Km), in which Km and Vmax among the basic parameters can be obtained via calculation with the Line-weaver-Burk double reciprocal plots. The Michaelis constant, Km, is equivalent to the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of Vmax, representing the affinity of the enzyme towards the substrate. It should be noted that the smaller value of Km corresponds to the stronger affinity between the enzyme (catalyst, the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers) and the substrate (TMB).53–55 Through the calculation mentioned above, it is known that the Km value of the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofiber catalysts towards TMB is 0.037 mM. By comparison, the Km value of the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers is lower than that of many other materials listed in Table 1, and the Vmax value is higher than that of those materials, demonstrating that the as-synthesized perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers possess a higher affinity towards TMB and superior catalytic efficiency.

L-Cysteine, as a semi-essential amino acid in human blood, plays a crucial role in numerous physiological processes, including redox reactions, protein folding, detoxification, metabolism and even some diseases, and this attaches great significance to the sensitive detection of L-cysteine. Although various detection methods have been established over the past decades, the colorimetric sensing approach has attracted more and more interest because the introduction of L-cysteine can be detected not only via instrumental analysis but also by the naked eye.60 In this work, considering that L-cysteine can reduce the oxidation state of TMB to TMB and result in the fading of the blue colour of the oxidase-like catalytic reaction system, a simple and efficient colorimetric assay is developed to detect the concentration of L-cysteine through monitoring the absorbance variance of the reaction system at 651 nm via UV-vis spectrophotometry. As displayed in Fig. 8a and c, when the concentration of L-cysteine increases, the intensity of absorbance at 651 nm reduces along with a clear blue colour fading, demonstrating that L-cysteine can inhibit the generation of the oxidized TMB molecules. Moreover, Fig. 8b shows the dose–response curve of the decreased absorption value (ΔA) after a 10 min reaction against serial concentrations of L-cysteine, based on which the corresponding linear calibration plot ranging from 2 to 20 μM (R2 = 0.9702) is obtained. Then the limit of detection (LOD) is calculated to be about 109.8 nM with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 (S/N = 3). This LOD of the as-synthesized perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers is better than those of some other reported materials used as chemosensors for L-cysteine detection.38,61–63 Furthermore, the determination of L-cysteine in a biological environment using our proposed colorimetric route has been performed. The concentration of L-cysteine in a human serum sample is analysed, the results of which are displayed in Table S1 (ESI†). The recoveries of the sample are shown from 98.2% to 101.3%, demonstrating that the developed approach for the determination of L-cysteine in biological systems is feasible and reliable.

Considering that other amino acids and ions in human blood may cause interference towards the detection of L-cysteine, a selectivity measurement was performed. In this selectivity experiment, the most common amino acids and ions in the human body were selected to test their inhibitory effects compared with that of L-cysteine. As depicted in Fig. 9, it is revealed that the reaction system was colourless and an obvious decline of absorption intensity at 651 nm was observed with L-cysteine as the inhibitor, while the blue colour of other reaction systems and the absorption intensity at 651 nm almost had no change after other interferential substances were added into the reaction systems as inhibitors as well. This result reveals that the as-synthesized perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers possess excellent selectivity for the detection of L-cysteine and this detection will not be interfered with by the other amino acids and ions when it is applied to human blood tests. It is particularly pointed out that the developed colorimetric route will not identify chiral isomers. A similar inhibitory effect towards the oxidation of TMB is also observed in the presence of D-cysteine (Fig. S6, ESI†).

Considering that the as-synthesized perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers possess the characteristics of a flexible free-standing membrane, they can also be used as monolithic oxidase mimics for on-demand colorimetric sensing. Unlike the nanozymes dispersed in the reaction solution, which require magnetic separation or complex centrifugation, the monolithic LaMnO3+δ nanofiber oxidase mimic as a bulk one can be put into and taken out from the reaction system easily just with a tiny pair of tweezers, suggesting its facile recycling ability. Therefore, an on/off switch of the catalytic reaction can be easily achieved by putting the LaMnO3+δ nanofiber membrane in or taking it out of the reaction system. As depicted in Fig. 10, the absorption intensity at 651 nm corresponding to a light blue colour of the reaction system was observed when the monolithic LaMnO3+δ oxidase mimic was put into the reaction system. In contrast, the absorption intensity at 651 nm and the blue colour of the reaction system remained nearly unchanged when the monolithic LaMnO3+δ oxidase mimic was taken out from the reaction system. When the monolithic LaMnO3+δ oxidase mimic was put into the reaction system again, the colour reaction was reinstated, leading to the continuous increment of the absorbance. This result indicates that the monolithic LaMnO3+δ nanofiber oxidase mimic can be used for on-demand colorimetric analysis.

The insets display the photographs of the corresponding reaction solutions and two photographs of the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofiber membrane. 
Conclusions
In summary, a simple and efficient route has been developed to prepare perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers through an electrospinning method followed by a calcination process. Owing to the effective composition, perovskite structure and unique morphology of the LaMnO3+δ nanofibers, the as-prepared materials exhibit superior oxidase-like catalytic activity. The steady-state kinetic experiment demonstrates that the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers possess a high affinity towards TMB as well as a good catalytic efficiency. Due to the excellent catalytic activity of the perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanofibers, a convenient and effective colorimetric method has been established to detect L-cysteine with a low limit of detection and a high selectivity. Furthermore, the perovskite LaMnO3+δ oxidase mimics can not only be dispersed in the reaction solution to catalyse the oxidation of TMB, but also serve as a monolithic one for on-demand colorimetric sensing. This work offers a simple, effective and low-budget route for the production of high-performance nanomaterials as oxidase mimics with promising potential applications in the fields of biosensors, medical diagnosis and environment monitoring.
