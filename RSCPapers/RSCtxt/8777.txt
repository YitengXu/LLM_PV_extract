    , Accepted 30th August 2016First published on 30th August 2016AbstractThe unique atomic-like absorption and emission spectra of rare earth (RE) doped materials have shaped a unique niche of applications, especially those that benefit from a better utilization of the infrared (IR) electromagnetic range. These materials in the bulk form have mostly been utilized in their earliest development for illuminators, lasers and displays. In the past decade, new frontiers, especially in the field of biomedical imaging and theranostics, have emerged as a result of the advancements in chemical methods to synthesize nano-sized RE doped materials. The distinctive characteristics of RE doped nanoparticles (RENPs) to absorb IR photons and emit at any specific desired wavelength spanning from the ultraviolet (UV) to the IR region have unlocked an avenue to a myriad of applications. This review article covers briefly some aspects on the fundamental principles that govern the luminescence characteristics of these RE doped materials, such as the mechanisms for electronic transitions, dopants and host chemistries. Next, we will present an overview on the state-of-the-art methods to synthesize RENPs with controlled size, morphology, core–shell heterostructure and surface chemistry. The underlying relationships of the physical characteristics of RENPs, such as particle size and structure, with the optical emission properties will also be discussed so as to offer some material guidelines for designing brightly IR-emitting RENPs. The applications of RENPs are next broadly grouped according to the material form where they are required for some applications: (1) single particle systems, and (2) monolithic nanostructured optically active polymeric composites.

1. Introduction
Rare earth (RE) doped materials composed of RE ions embedded within an inorganic crystalline host matrix have attracted considerable attention owing to their unique optical properties that are controlled mostly through f–f electronic transitions which mostly do not change with particle size, unlike quantum dots. Their distinctive optical properties featuring large Stokes and anti-Stokes shifts, narrow and multi-peak emission profiles, long lifetime and excellent photostability have enabled RE doped materials to be promising alternatives to conventional organic fluorophores and quantum dots. The theories of electronic properties and transitions of RE ions were mostly established by Judd and Wybourne in 1962–1965.1–3 In the 1980s, detailed calculations and experimental data for the 4f energy levels and crystal field splitting of RE ions in halide crystals were reported by Crosswhite and Carnall.4,5 These calculations allowed the design of various dopant schemes and optical behaviors of RE doped materials based on first principles to predict the likely emission wavelengths and intensities from various RE dopants. Before the 1990s, the studies of the RE-based optical properties were mainly focused on the bulk materials (e.g., laser materials such as Nd:YAG and lamp phosphors such as Y2O3:Eu) due to challenges in the chemistry of synthesizing RE doped nanocrystals. Routine preparation of RE doped nanoparticles (RENPs) was largely achieved around the 2000s unlocking new application avenues. The current leading interest is centered on the rational design and manipulation of excitation and emission profiles of RENPs to achieve better performance (e.g., energy efficiency) in applications.
It is critical to have the ability to precisely tailor the luminescence characteristics of RE doped materials because their application benefits sometimes depend largely on the excitation and emission wavelengths, and their corresponding brightness. The infrared (IR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum has attracted attention due to recent advancements in applications including night-vision imaging, security, telecommunications, biomedical imaging and solar energy conversion. In particular, IR is superior to ultraviolet (UV) and visible light in biomedical imaging due to its low attenuation by tissue components. For instance, RENPs that have both excitation and emission wavelengths falling within the short wavelength infrared (SWIR, 1 to 2.5 μm) range are beneficial for minimally invasive multiplex small animal imaging due to their deeper penetration depths of ∼1 cm.6 In recent years, significant achievements, such as multicolor tuning by single wavelength excitation and luminescence enhancement of RENPs, have been made to control the luminescence properties of RENPs and have been highlighted in many other reviews.7–11 Although IR emission is emitted together with visible emission from RENPs, the correlation between IR and visible emission is not clear and few reports have focused on the IR emission properties of RENPs. Besides tailoring the luminescence characteristics, the ability to control the physical characteristics (e.g., size, morphology and surface) is a critical design aspect of RENPs because most applications have specific requirements to these physical features in the final product, device or application so as to achieve the best performance. For example, having a small particle size provides a series of desirable features including reduced optical scattering and improved biodistribution, which are generally needed for in vivo biomedical applications. In the case of optically-active polymer composite waveguides fabricated with RENPs, it is required that the particle size must be less than 100 nm in order to effectively minimize scattering losses and consequently improve device efficiency. The well-defined RENPs with controlled size and shape are generally prepared in an oil phase where organic surfactants serve as capping agents to control crystal growth, leading to the formation of a hydrophobic surface coating. Subsequent surface modification is therefore often required depending on the application of interest. The surface characteristics of RENPs would dictate the extent of agglomeration as well as the strength of the emission intensities.
RE doped materials have been adopted in a broad range of applications from solid state lasers to biomedical imaging probes. In this review, we will mainly focus on the IR-related applications of RENPs that involve either excitation or emission light falling within the IR range. These IR-based applications of RE doped materials are broadly categorized into two groups based on the physical material form in this review: (1) as single nanoparticles and (2) as monolithic composites comprising RENPs. A promising application of RENPs in the form of nanoparticles is its use as a new class of optical probes for biomedical imaging and theranostics. Mixing RENPs with polymers seeks to combine the advantages of both inorganic materials (such as durability and intense emissions) and polymers (such as light weight and flexibility). The fabrication of optically active polymeric composites composed of brightly emitting RENPs further expands its applications to the fields of flexible optoelectronics, telecommunication devices, photodetectors and photovoltaics. In these applications, it is essential to tailor the luminescence, size and surface characteristics of RENPs to obtain optimum performance as part of a device or an optical probe.
In this review, we will focus on the methods of tailoring the luminescence characteristics, size, morphology and surface characteristics of RENPs to create brightly emitting nanocrystals or composites. The correlation between luminescence, morphology and surface characteristics of RENPs and specific applications will be highlighted. A number of emerging IR-based applications using RE doped materials in the form of single nanoparticles or composites in engineering devices and biomedical applications will be reviewed. The future prospects for the use of these RE doped nanocrystals or composites will also be discussed briefly.
2. Tailoring the luminescence characteristics of RENPs
2.1. Photon pathways of RENPs
RE elements are the lanthanides (from La to Lu) together with Sc and Y. Trivalent RE ions have similar physical and chemical properties owing to their similar electron configurations. The 4fn electronic states of RE ions are separated by spin–orbit coupling and electronic repulsion to produce a myriad of complex energy levels that allow for an immense possibility of intraconfigurational transitions. The luminescence of RE ions stems mostly from the specific electronic transitions between the ladder-like energy levels within the 4f orbitals. These f–f transitions are shielded by 5s and 5p electrons and thus produce well-defined atomic-like emission spectra which are hardly influenced by the physicochemical properties of the host materials. This unique shielding effect imparts a weak electron–phonon coupling, and thus, narrow-band emission resulting from electronic transitions.
Generally, direct excitation of RE ions is a relatively inefficient process due to the forbidden character of the 4f transitions.12 The doping technique that involves the introduction of a low concentration of ions (i.e. dopants) into an inorganic crystalline lattice (i.e. host) to obtain doped materials is widely employed to prepare luminescent materials with intense emission. The RE dopants usually act as localized optically active centers that emit at a specific wavelength when excited. These dopants are further divided into sensitizers and activators in the case of sensitized luminescence, where one dopant ion emits radiation from its high energetic state that results from the energy transfer from another dopant ion. The dopant ion that gives out emission is described as an activator, while the ion that donates energy to the activator is called the sensitizer. The absorption cross-sections of most RE activator ions are relatively low, resulting in low pump efficiency. Thus, a sensitizer ion that exhibits a high absorption cross-section is usually used as an energy donor to the activator ion so as to enhance pump efficiency.
The mechanisms that govern the luminescence emission originating from energy transfer within the 4f orbitals are broadly divided into three categories based on the involved photon energy and the net number of photons: (1) downconversion (DC) also known as quantum cutting, (2) down-shifting (DS) and (3) upconversion (UC) (see Fig. 1). The DC process refers to a process that involves generation of two or more low energy photons by splitting one absorbed high energy photon, resulting in potential intrinsic quantum efficiencies that are >100%. The DS process describes a single photon process in which one incident higher energy photon is converted into one lower energy photon. The UC process is a nonlinear optical phenomenon known as an anti-Stokes emission where successive absorption of two or more incident low energy photons results in emission at a shorter wavelength (i.e. higher photon energy) than the incident wavelength.
 Fig. 1  Overall schematics of typical energy conversion processes for RE doped materials: (a) downconversion (DC), (b) down-shifting (DS), (c) upconversion (UC) via excited state absorption (ESA), energy transfer upconversion (ETU), and cooperative energy transfer (CET) and energy migration-mediated upconversion (EMU), where “A”, “S”, “L” and “M” represent “activator”, “sensitizer”, “ladder” and “migrator”, respectively. 
The earliest report on the photon UC concept was given by N Bloembergen in 1959,13 where he suggested that IR photons could be detected and counted through sequential absorption within the excited energy levels of given RE or transition-metal ions. The role of energy transfers between two RE ions in UC was later suggested by Auzel in 1966 using the Yb3+ ions to sensitize Er3+ and Tm3+.14 The similar Yb3+ sensitized UC phenomenon was also reported by other groups in the late 1960s.15,16 The UC processes of RE doped nanomaterials are basically realized through four major mechanisms: (1) excited-state absorption (ESA), (2) energy transfer upconversion (ETU), (3) cooperative energy transfer (CET) and (4) energy migration-mediated upconversion (EMU) (see Fig. 1). ESA refers to the successive absorption of two or more pump photons by a single ion to excite the ion from the ground state to a high energy state followed by UC emission through the radiative relaxation of the ion from its excitation state back to its ground state. ESA is independent of dopant ion concentration because all the energy transfer processes occur within one single ion. Thus, the ESA mechanism mostly dominates UC luminescence from the dopant–host system at low dopant concentrations.
In contrast to ESA that is dictated by one ion, ETU involves two types of neighboring ions: one ion serves as a sensitizer and the other one is an activator. In this UC process, the incoming pump photon energy is first absorbed by the sensitizer ion, leading to excitation from the ground to a metastable state. Then, the activator ion is excited from the ground state to the lower exciting state through non-radiative energy transfer from the metastable state of the neighboring sensitizer ion while this ion relaxes back to its ground state. A second energy transfer from another excited neighboring sensitizer promotes the activator ion to its higher excited state. Next, the excited activator relaxes from this higher energy state to the ground state in a radiative way, leading to UC luminescence emission. The distance between the sensitizer and the activator strongly affects the probability of non-radiative energy transfer. Hence, ETU is a dopant ion concentration dependent process. The sensitizer ion concentration is usually 10 to 50 times of the activator concentration to ensure efficient energy transfer and thus bright UC emission.
It is notable that both ESA and ETU processes require a real intermediate energy level of the activator ion. Unlike ESA and ETU, the intermediate energy level of the activator is not essential in CET. The CET involves three RE ions including two sensitizer ions and one activator ion. In the CET process, two sensitizer ions are first excited through absorbing pump photons. Subsequently, simultaneous energy transfer from these two excited sensitizers to one neighboring activator takes place followed by UC emission through the relaxation of the activator from its excited energy states back to its ground state. However, the UC efficiency of CET is approximately three orders of magnitude lower than that of ETU due to the need for quasi-virtual pair levels during transitions.
Recently, a new type of UC mechanism known as EMU has been proposed by Liu's group.17 The EMU involves four types of RE ions including sensitizer, ladder or accumulator, migrator, and activator ions which are incorporated in a well-defined core–shell structure. The sensitizer and ladder ions are doped in the core layer while the activator ions are incorporated in the shell layer. The energy transfer between the ladder and the activator is bridged by the arrays of migrator ions through the core–shell interface. In EMU, the sensitizer ion is used to absorb pump photons and subsequently excite a neighboring ladder ion to excited states followed by further energy transfer to the neighboring migrator. Then the energy is transferred to the core–shell interface through random energy hopping within the migrator ion sub-lattice and finally trapped by the activator ions located in the shell layer. The separation of the sensitizer/ladder and the activator is essential in the EMU process for eliminating deleterious cross-relaxation. EMU can be used to achieve UC emission for activators that do not have long-lived intermediate energy levels. In recent decades, UC mechanisms have been extensively studied and reported, whilst the understanding of DS emission has been drawn mostly from earlier studies on laser materials. However, the correlation between UC and DS (e.g. near-infrared (NIR) to SWIR emission) radiative and non-radiative pathways (multi-phonon relaxation) is not clear, especially in RE doped nanomaterials. Most reports have focused only on either the UC or DS pathway independently. Further studies are warranted to establish the correlations between DS and UC emission, especially in the nanosized regime. The size dependent surface quenching and phonon energy effects would lead to alterations in non-radiative pathways and subsequently varying UC and DS emission.
2.2. Dopant chemistry
There are two key aspects to the luminescence characteristics that are tuned according to the requirements of the application: (1) desired excitation and emission wavelengths, and (2) emission efficiency (i.e. intense emission from low power incident excitation source). The excitation and emission wavelengths for RENPs are controlled by the careful selection of suitable RE ions. Based on the existing rich and fertile information available on the multiple energy level transitions from decades of research on RE physics, a broad range of excitation and emission profiles spanning from UV to visible and IR is possible with the right RE selection (see Table 1).18 In addition, multicolor tuning can also be achieved by precisely controlling the dopant concentrations using dual activators of Tm3+ and Er3+ (see Fig. 2a and b).19 The relative intensity ratios from multiple emission peaks can also be tuned to quench any undesired parasitic emission with the deliberate selection of multiple dopant schemes. As an example, Yb–Er codoped systems exhibit characteristic UC visible emission and DS IR emission upon excitation at 975 nm. For IR-based applications such as telecommunication applications, visible emission is not needed, whilst a strong signal in the IR region (telecommunication window is ∼1400 to 1600 nm) is critical. The ability to tune the relative emission intensities allows for a more efficient RENP and consequently more efficient devices. It has been reported that co-doping with Ce3+ leads to the effective quenching of UC visible emission from Er3+ and enhancement in the DS IR emission upon excitation at 975 nm (see Fig. 2c and d).20,21

Besides selecting the correct RE ion, the dopant concentration also affects the emission profiles of RENPs by altering the interionic distance which dictates the strength of energy transfer. For instance, the red to green emission ratio of Er3+ ions increases with increasing concentration of either Yb3+ or Er3+ ions through phonon assisted non-radiative relaxation and cross-relaxation processes within two adjacent Er3+ ions or the back-energy transfer from Er3+ to Yb3+ ions.19,22,23 For these RE doped luminescent materials, there is also an optimum concentration for the emission center, where the further increase in the concentration of RE emitting ions leads to concentration quenching. Concentration quenching is determined mainly by the dipole–dipole interaction between RE ions. The quenching effects vary according to R−6, where R is the interionic distance between emitting ions. Luminescence is completely quenched for ions separated at a distance shorter than R, whereas ions separated by a distance longer than R are not subjected to complete quenching. The typical critical interionic distance where concentration quenching occurs is approximately between 0.5 and 2 nm for a range of different host systems.24
It should be noted that transition metal ions with d–d transitions have also been used as co-sensitizers to enhance the emission efficiency or tune the emission profiles of RENPs. The energy transfer between the transition metal and RE ions enables further control of the population of the excited energy levels of RE ions and consequently enables the emission profile to be adjusted according to the design requirements. For example, with the codoping of Mo3+ or Mn2+ ions in the Yb–Er system at low concentrations (<0.5 mol%), the excitation energy is absorbed by Mo–Yb or the Mn–Yb dimer (i.e. co-sensitizers) and the subsequent energy transfer takes place in a much higher excited energy state than that in the Yb–Er system (see Fig. 2e).25,26 This change in the energy transfer process leads to a decrease in the non-radiative processes that often occur at the lower energy levels of Er3+ and consequently leads to a great enhancement of green UC emission from Er3+.25,26 In contrast, a further increase in the concentration of Mn2+ ions (>5 mol%) would interfere with the transition possibilities between green and red emission of Er3+, leading to a more intense red emission. The change in the intensity of the green and red emission was ascribed to the presence of non-radiative energy transfer from the 4S3/2 level of Er3+ to the excited transition level of Mn2+, followed by back-energy transfer to the 4F9/2 level of Er3+, leading to an enhanced intensity ratio of red-to-green emission (see Fig. 2f).27–30
2.3. Host chemistry
Besides selecting the right dopants and optimizing their concentrations, it is just as important to choose suitable host materials, especially when designing low photon energy IR-emitting materials. The local environment around the RE dopants, such as the site symmetry, crystal field strength, and electron–phonon interaction strength, influences mostly the emission intensity. Generally, the efficiency of a given transition is controlled predominantly by multiphonon relaxation (MPR) rates and concentration quenching mechanisms which are dependent on the selection of the host materials.31,32 MPR is a non-radiative process where the energy difference between the higher and lower energy levels is converted into many lattice phonons.33 The rate of MPR can be roughly expressed as31,34 (1)where α and B are parameters relating to electron–phonon coupling and zero-point phonon emission, respectively, ΔE is the energy gap between the energy level of interest and the next lower one and ℏω is an effective phonon energy of the host material. As more phonons are needed in low phonon energy hosts to bridge the energy gap to allow non-radiative processes, non-radiative losses are less likely and efficient emission (i.e. radiative transitions) is more likely to occur. Hence, a low phonon energy of the host material is favored to minimize non-radiative relaxation and enhance the emission efficiency. This is a critical aspect when designing low photon energy IR-emitting materials, where the gap for the energy transitions is small and the possibility of competing non-radiative relaxation is high.
The common inorganic host materials sorted by their maximum phonon energies are as follows: iodide (160 cm−1) < bromide (175–190 cm−1) < chloride (∼200 cm−1) < chalcogenide (200–300 cm−1) < fluoride (∼350 cm−1) < oxide (∼500 cm−1) < tellurite (600–850 cm−1) < germanate (800–975 cm−1) < silicate (1000–1100 cm−1) < phosphate (1100 cm−1) < borate (1400 cm−1).35–37 Although heavy halides including chloride, bromide and iodide and chalcogenide have a lower phonon energy than fluoride, they are not the most ideal hosts for RENPs due to their hygroscopicity. Oxides are relatively more chemically stable; however, their relatively high phonon energies are detrimental to the emission efficiency, especially in the IR region (i.e. small energy gap). In contrast, fluorides that exhibit a relatively low phonon energy and acceptable chemical stability are usually used as hosts for preparing high emission efficiency RENPs. Besides fluorides, fluorohalides MFX (M = metal ion; X = Cl, Br, I) are other possible efficient host materials because they utilize the low phonon energy of heavy halides while inhibiting their hygroscopicity by introducing F− ions.
To accommodate RE ions in the host matrix to form stable RENPs, a close lattice structure between host and dopant ions is required. Lanthanide compounds, alkaline earth compounds as well as some transition metal compounds are ideal host candidates for RE doping because the positive ions in these compounds have similar ionic sizes to RE ions. It is notable that doping trivalent RE ions into bivalent alkaline earth compounds or tetravalent transition metal compounds would induce the formation of crystal defects in the host lattice such as interstitial ions and vacancies in order to maintain the charge neutrality. These defects in host materials can have a detrimental effect on the emission intensity, even in low phonon energy hosts.
Moreover, the crystal structure also has a significant effect on the luminescence behaviors of RENPs, which is known as a phase-dependent emission property. A less symmetric crystal phase is usually preferred for the high emission efficiency, as more uneven components around the dopant ions in the crystal field of a low symmetry host enhance the electronic coupling between 4f energy levels and subsequently increase the f–f transition probabilities of the dopant ions.37,38 For example, the UC efficiency of hexagonal phase NaYF4 bulk materials doped with Yb,Er is about an order of magnitude higher than that of their cubic phase counterparts,39 and monoclinic ZrO2 nanoparticles exhibit higher UC efficiency than their tetragonal phase counterparts.40 Therefore, the emission efficiency of RENPs can be enhanced by lowering the local symmetry of dopant ions in the crystal field of a given host. An alternative strategy besides changing the host materials is through an intentional doping of non-active cationic ions such as Li+ ions. The non-active ions substitute the cationic ions of the host lattice or occupy the interstitial sites around the RE ions, leading to a lowering of the crystal field symmetry around the RE dopants and the increase of the overall emission efficiency.
2.4. Core–shell heterostructure
RENPs generally exhibit a weaker emission intensity compared to their bulk counterpart.41 This size-dependent emission reduction phenomenon is correlated with the surface states that are features of imperfect crystal lattices and high densities of impurities and ligands. The lower emission intensity for RENPs is one of the bottlenecks limiting their wide implementation in various applications. A routine approach to eliminate the deleterious effects of surface states is to create a core–shell heterostructure with an epitaxial undoped shell covering the optically active RE doped interior core. Using this core–shell structure, all the RE emitting ions are confined within the core and unfavorable energy transfers with surface quenching species are effectively inhibited, leading to enhanced emission efficiency.
The core–shell heterostructure also offers an additional dimension within the nanoparticle design space that enables us to further tune the emission of RENPs.42 The rational design of the RE doped core–shell heterostructures has allowed the discovery of new energy exchange pathways across the core–shell or shell–shell interfaces, leading to the successful control over the excitation and emission spectra of RENPs. Using this platform, different activators are readily separated into different regions (i.e. core or shell) within one single nanoparticle to eliminate deleterious cross-relaxation quenching between two activator ions and therefore optimally combine multiple luminescence behaviors of different RE dopants. The long-range energy migration across the core–shell interface is harnessed to bridge desired energy transfers to enable the design of unique excitation and emission profiles. Table 2 shows a summary of various core–shell architectures and their corresponding optical properties that have been reported. In particular, some of these examples involve the adjustment of the excitation of Er3+ ions to 800 nm rather than at the typical 975 nm. The change in the excitation profile is achieved using a tri-dopant system of Nd–Yb–Er (see Fig. 3).43 Briefly, the two sensitizers Nd3+ and Yb3+ are separated into different regions within the core–shell heterostructure. The 800 nm excitation photons are absorbed by Nd3+ ions located either in the outermost shell or in the core followed by the energy transfer between Nd3+ and Yb3+ ions that are incorporated in the middle shell. The energy is further transferred to the activator Er3+ ion, resulting in the desired emission using an 800 nm excitation source. The ability to tailor the IR excitation wavelength is critical for the utility of RENPs for biomedical imaging. For example, excitation at 800 nm results in lower tissue absorption compared to that of the 975 nm excitation, which consequently enable a deeper penetration depth for biomedical imaging.

3. Synthesis of RENPs with controlled size, morphology and heterostructure
The particle size and morphology of RENPs influence many physical and chemical properties of particulate materials and are valuable indicators of their adaptability for downstream engineering of these particles for various applications. For instance, larger and more spherical particles will typically flow more easily than smaller or high aspect ratio particles. In contrast, smaller size particles with higher surface charge density are typically more stable in suspension. Therefore, the synthesis of nanostructured materials with narrow size distribution for a specific morphology has been a key focus for many researchers.57–59 Although the electronic transitions of RENPs that govern optical absorption and emission are barely altered with size,60–62 it is critical to control the particle size and morphology to meet the requirements of other engineering aspects such as creating miniaturized highly-emissive flexible devices or in its use as biomedical probes in imaging and diagnostic applications.63–67 It should be noted that although the excitation and emission wavelengths do not change much with the particle characteristics, the emission intensities are strongly dependent on the size and surface characteristics as highlighted in the earlier sections.41
In this section, we will focus on the particle synthesis using solution-based chemical methods. The solution-based chemical synthesis method is an approach where soluble and insoluble components are used to prepare solutions or suspensions that are subsequently reacted in a solvent medium that is subjected to temperatures and pressures to crystallize materials directly from solution. Specifically, we will summarize the thermal decomposition and solvo(hydro)thermal methods that are commonly used to synthesize RENPs with controlled physical characteristics and heterostructures by adjusting the role of precursor and solvent chemistries. The comparison of thermal decomposition and the solvo(hydro)thermal method is shown in Table 3. Generally, a higher yield of the product is obtained using the solvothermal method, whilst a narrower size distribution of nanoparticles (typically sub-20 nm) at a lower yield is obtained using the thermal decomposition method.

3.1. Thermal decomposition synthesis method
The thermal decomposition method for preparing inorganic nanocrystals has been proven as a useful method for the synthesis of high-quality RENPs. Briefly, the thermal decomposition method involves: (1) dissolution of organometallic precursors for corresponding fluorides or oxides in high boiling point organic solvents, (2) removal of residual moisture, oxygen and other small molecule impurities in the solution in an inert atmosphere (e.g., N2 and Ar), and (3) rapid decomposition of organometallic precursors at a specific elevated temperature (see Fig. 4), leading to rapid nucleation followed by growth. Generally, the organic precursors are RE-based organic salts (e.g., trifluoroacetates, oleates and stearates), whilst octadecene (ODE), oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OM) are commonly used as high boiling point solvents, where OA and OM serve additionally as the surfactants. Rapid decomposition of organometallic precursors at the specific temperature allows for the burst of crystal nucleation, which essentially decouples nucleation from the growth phase. By decoupling nucleation from growth, highly monodispersed nanocrystals are obtained. Further growth of the crystals is limited since most of the precursors are consumed. However, through the Ostwald ripening phenomenon (e.g., caused by prolonged heating after the initial nucleation event), the small crystals may dissolve and redeposit onto larger crystals, resulting in a larger average particle size and a broader size distribution. The crystal nucleation and growth processes are further adjusted using other processing parameters, such as precursor concentration, solvent composition, heating rate and reaction time (see Section 3.1.1). This approach has been extended as a common route to yield a multitude of high-quality, monodisperse RENPs based on a myriad of hosts including REF 3,68,69 REOF,70–73 REOCl,74 NaREF4,64,75–81 LiREF 4,82–84 KREF 4,82,85 BaREF 5,86,87 and MF2 (M = Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba)88,89 (see Table 4). Amongst these hosts, most of the efforts in the past decade have been centered on refining the synthesis chemistry for the hexagonal-phase NaYF4, which is one of the most brightly emitting RENPs.

3.1.1. Shape and heterostructure engineering via the thermal decomposition method. 
(a) Types and concentration of dopants used. 
The doping of ions (e.g., RE, transition metals, alkali earth metals and halides) alters the solubility resulting in changes in the nucleation and growth of nanocrystals. Therefore, ion doping also provides an alternative approach to modify the crystal phase, size and morphology of nanomaterials, leading to enhancements in the optical emission intensities. There are two general types of doping strategies: (1) homovalent, and (2) heterovalent ion doping. For the homovalent ion doping strategy, the dopant has the same valence as one of the ions present in the original host lattice. The crystal lattice will contract or expand accordingly when smaller or larger sized homovalent ions are introduced to substitute the host ions. In contrast, it would be more difficult to predict whether the crystal lattice expands or contracts using the heterovalent ion doping strategy. The introduction of heterovalent ions within the host is generally more complex considering that vacancies or interstitial ions are created to maintain the crystal charge neutrality. The effects of RE doping on the host crystal have largely been associated with the ionic size, polarizability and solubility of the dopant ions.20,90 For instance, doping with light RE elements with large ionic radii typically forms the hexagonal crystal phase for the NaREF4 host due to their higher polarizability.90 Furthermore, as-synthesized NaYF4 nanoparticles tend to exist in the cubic phase rather than in the hexagonal phase. Generally, the cubic crystal phase of NaYF4 is obtained at low Na:RE (<1.5:1) and reaction temperature (<330 °C). There are two possible reasons for the tendency of forming cubic phase NaYF4: (1) the cubic phase is a thermodynamically more stable phase, and (2) the higher surface tension of small nanoparticles induces the phase transformation from an anisotropic (hexagonal) to isotropic (cubic) crystal structure.91 However, the hexagonal phase is preferred since it has a much higher emission intensity due to a higher density of favorable lattice sites for substitution with RE ions compared to their cubic counterpart. An effective way to obtain hexagonal phase NaYF4 nanoparticles with a small size (i.e. sub-20 nm) is to introduce co-dopants of light RE ions with large ionic radii such as Gd3+. The addition of Gd3+ as a dopant altered the crystal growth rate due to changes in the particle surface charges, leading to a general size reduction of the as-synthesized hexagonal phase NaYF4.90 The substitution of Y3+ by the larger Gd3+ resulted in an increased electron charge density on the crystal surface which substantially slowed the diffusion of negatively charged F− ions to the surface and finally resulted in particle size reduction. Similar findings have been reported on the Ce3+ dopant effect on both the morphological and optical properties of NaYF4 nanoparticles. The morphology and size of NaYF4 nanoparticles exhibited a gradual decrease in the aspect ratio (i.e. from nanorod to nanosphere) with increasing Ce3+ dopant concentration from 0 up to 50 mol% (see Fig. 5).20

The distribution of the longitudinal dimensions of the as-synthesized nanoparticles is shown in the images. Reproduced with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry.20 
(b) Effects of the precursor ratio of Na+:RE3+ and the solvent ratio of OA:OM:ODE. 
In addition to the dopant type and concentration, the precursor ratio (e.g., Na+:RE3+) and the solvent ratio (e.g., OA:OM:ODE) are also important factors that significantly affect the physical characteristics of RENPs. Generally, a low Na+:RE3+ ratio (e.g. <1.5:1) is favored to synthesize cubic phase NaREF4, while the hexagonal phase NaREF4 is generally obtained at a high Na+:RE3+ ratio (e.g. >1.5:1). In addition, the Na+:RE3+ ratio also affects the size of RENPs. For example, NaYF4:Yb,Er nanospheres with a size of 11, 40, and 110 nm were synthesized using an Na+:RE3+ molar ratio of 2:1, 1.6:1, and 1.5:1, respectively at a OA:OM solvent molar ratio of 8:5.41 At high Na+:RE3+ ratios, the nucleation kinetics is accelerated, leading to the formation of a higher number density of nuclei that have a smaller nuclei size. Consequently, one would typically expect smaller RENPs to be formed at high Na+/RE3+ ratios.
Besides the ratio of Na+:RE3+, solvent composition also has an effect on the size and morphology of RENPs. In this case, the solvent molecule (e.g., OA) also serves as a surfactant or a surface capping agent that binds to the particle surface. With a greater amount of the surface capping agent in the reaction mixture, growth of RENPs is inhibited, leading to smaller RENPs. For example, the ratio of oleate anions and OA molecules promotes or inhibits the crystallographic facets of RENPs, which results in precise selective epitaxial core–shell growth by tailoring the shape and composition of RENP nanocrystals, such as dumbbell-shaped nanocrystals, bamboo-shaped nanorods, flower-shape nanocrystals and hourglass shaped nanocrystals.92
By varying the ratio of sodium to RE trifluoroacetates and the reaction duration, the particle shape transformation from spheres to nanorods to hexagonal nanoprisms, and eventually to hexagonal nanoplates has been reported.64 The NaYF4:Yb,Er crystals exhibited a morphological change from a sphere to a rod when the Na+/Y3+ ratio decreased from 2.37 to 2.16 for reaction durations of 21 and 23 min, respectively. For higher Na+/Y3+ ratios, since the nucleation kinetics is accelerated, the particle shape transformation would similarly be expedited. The nuclei would typically adopt the morphology with the lowest specific surface area (sphere) which corresponds to the lowest surface energy. As the reaction proceeds, the preferential binding of the surface capping agent to specific crystal planes alters particle growth, leading to the formation anisotropic particles. A further extension of the reaction duration to 28 min led to the formation of particles shaped as hexagonal prisms (see Fig. 6). Similar observations for the effects of the precursor ratios on Yb3+, Ho3+, and Ce3+ co-doped NaYF4 were reported.64

(c) Effects of shell thickness. 
The growth of an undoped epitaxial shell on the RENPs has been demonstrated to successfully prevent the quenching of RE emitting centers by quenching species such as surface defects and hydroxyl or hydrocarbon impurities. Furthermore, it is only by controlling both shell composition and thickness that novel energy transfer pathways such as the EMU transition as described in the earlier section were made possible, leading to significant enhancements in emission efficiencies.17 Besides enhancing the emission from RENPs, the epitaxial growth of the shell offers additional opportunities for further control of the size and morphology of RENPs. In order to coat an undoped shell on the RENPs, the precursor solution for the desired shell composition is slowly added into the reaction mixture after the growth of the optically active RENP core that contains specific RE emitting centers. The size of the particles would increase correspondingly with the growth of each shell layer, where the shape of the RENPs may change from spherical to hexagonal with increasing size as well.93 Anisotropic growth of the shell where complete shell enclosure was not formed has recently been reported (see Fig. 7).94 In the case of anisotropic shell growth, the epitaxial growth of the shell layer was faster in the lateral directions than in the axial direction. This phenomenon was most evident for thin shell coatings or where there is a large lattice mismatch between the core and the shell component. The strong competition between ligand inhibition and epitaxial shell growth led to the difference in growth rates in the different directions. Typically, a greater lattice mismatch promotes the growth of oblong and elongated shells instead of conformal surface coverage on the RENPs.

3.2. Solvo(hydro)thermal synthesis method
Hydrothermal or solvothermal synthesis is a versatile synthesis technique that involves reacting precursors in aqueous or non-aqueous solvent media, respectively, at elevated temperatures (25 °C or greater) and pressures (1 atm or greater) to crystallize materials over a broad range of particle sizes directly from solution in a single process step. Specialized reaction vessels known as autoclaves are usually required for the solvo(hydro)thermal reactions, in which a high pressure and temperature environment is generated. Generally, highly crystalline phases are prepared at much lower temperatures with higher yields using solvo(hydro)thermal method than the thermal decomposition method for the synthesis of RENPs. Besides selecting suitable precursors, solvents and reaction conditions (e.g., duration, temperature, and pressure), the phase purity, particle size and morphology of RENPS are tailored with the addition of surface-active agents, also known as surfactants. Table 5 shows a summary of various hosts that have been prepared with the addition of various surfactants using the solvo(hydro)thermal method.

3.2.1. Particle shape engineering via the solvo(hydro)thermal method. 
(a) Effects of solution pH. 
A systematic study on the effects of different fluorine precursor sources and solution pH on the particle morphology has shown that hydrothermally-prepared RE doped particles with a myriad of morphologies were obtained for NaLuF4 (see Fig. 8).58 Using NH4F as a F− source, regular hexagonal microprismatic shaped NaLuF4 crystals with an average size of 6.6 × 4.6 μm at pH = 3 were obtained, while regular hexagonal microprisms with a uniform size of 3.5 × 5.5 μm in diameter were obtained at pH = 7. By adjusting the solution pH to 10, hexagonal microdisks with smooth surfaces with remarkable uniformity were prepared. Since the solubility of the precursors used is highly dependent on the solution pH, the onset of homogenous nucleation and subsequent growth mechanisms are modified by varying the pH conditions. Subsequently, particles with different morphologies are obtained as a consequence of the change in crystallization conditions.

(b) Surfactants or surface-capping agents. 
Some of the surfactants that have been reported to control the phase and shape evolution of RENPs are sodium citrate, ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid (EDTA), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), poly(ethylene imine) (PEI), and poly(acrylic acid).95–97,101,104,110–113 For example, NaYF4:Yb,Er particles with aspect ratios ranging from 1 to 5.5 and particle sizes ranging from 200 to 500 nm were synthesized using different surfactants (citric acid, PAA, EDTA and sodium citrate).104 Amongst these samples, PAA-modified particles exhibited the highest aspect ratio and degree of anisotropy, while sodium citrate-modified particles were mostly isotropic. The different particle morphologies were controlled by modifying the binding affinity of surfactants to specific crystal planes which led to the preferential growth of some planes at the expense of others. The molecular weight of the polymeric surfactants also plays a crucial role in the formation of RENPs with different shapes and sizes. High molecular weight PEI was reported to be highly efficient in controlling particle growth, resulting in the crystallization of ∼50 nm spheres that were also stable against aggregation.101
(c) Liquid–solid-solution (LSS) strategy. 
The LSS strategy is another approach for synthesizing a large variety of nanocrystals with different chemical and physical properties.109 The key characteristic of the LSS strategy is that the reaction, phase transfer and particle separation take place at the interface.102,109,116 Briefly, a triphasic system is prepared comprising a solution (e.g., metal salt solution), solid (e.g., sodium lineoleate) and liquid (e.g., mixture of lineolic acid in ethanol). After the phase transfer of metal ions from the solution to the solid phase, the metal ions react at the interface to form either halide or oxide-based particles. Generally, for the preparation of hexagonal phase NaYF4:Yb,Er RENPs, high NaF and low RE content are preferred and the temperature and reaction duration needs to be carefully controlled to obtain the desired particle morphology. For example, the length-to-diameter ratio of NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorods is increased at lower temperatures, while a short duration favors the formation of spherical particles.116 The preferential formation of nanorods demonstrates that surfactants such as OA selectively bind to the NaYF4 nanocrystal surfaces that are parallel to the c-axis of the growing crystallites. Consequently, preferential binding renders the epitaxial growth along the 〈001〉 directions and leads to the formation of nanorods. Employing a similar LSS synthetic system, Liu and co-workers prepared a variety of NaYF4 RENPs where altering RE concentration led to a series of sizes (down to ∼10 nm), crystal structure (cubic or hexagonal), and emission characteristics (green to blue).90 Mn2+ doped NaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles were also synthesized based on a modified LSS solvothermal strategy, where co-doping with Mn2+ was found to result in a hexagonal to cubic shape transformation.30

4. Surface modification and functionalization of RENPs
Highly monodisperse RENPs are mainly synthesized in high-boiling point organic solvents using the thermal decomposition method. For example, OA is often used as a solvent and a surfactant to control the crystal growth by coordinating to the nanoparticle surface and forming a hydrophobic layer of surface ligands. The limited chemical functional groups and poor aqueous solubility of OA prevent its subsequent functionalization for biomedical applications. Surface modification for improving the dispersion quality of RENPs is also crucial for fabricating transparent nanocomposites composed of uniformly dispersed RENPs within a polymer matrix. To obtain highly emissive nanocomposites, the scattering losses arising from the agglomeration of RENPs especially at high solid loading need to be minimized. These RENP incorporated polymer nanocomposites have many potential applications in fabricating flexible devices. It should be noted that the surfactants used for surface modification are expected to affect the optical performance and efficiency by attenuating either the excitation or emission light. The alkyl and hydroxyl groups on surfactants have been reported to deactivate surface RE ions and quench any emission from nanoparticles. Consequently, for RENPs, it is typical to grow an additional undoped shell to limit surface quenching effects. It has also been reported that the emission brightness of RENPs is also influenced by the extent of refractive index mismatch at the particle boundary with its surroundings. By reducing the refractive index mismatch between the particle and its surroundings using a suitable surface coating agent, the reflectance losses at the interface were reduced, leading to brighter emission from RENPs.117
The most widely used approach to functionalize particle surfaces with the desired chemical groups is ligand engineering via ligand exchange or ligand oxidation. For example, hydrophobic ligands have been replaced by a wide variety of hydrophilic organic molecules, such as polyacrylic acid (PAA),118 polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP),119 polyamidoamine (PAMAM),120 and polyethylene glycol diacid (PEG).121 Recently, ligand exchange has also been demonstrated with an amphiphilic molecule of hydrolyzed polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane-graft-polymethyl methacrylate (H-POSS-PMMA).122,123 After the ligand exchange process, the dispersion of H-POSS-PMMA modified RENPs within a commonly used SU8 polymer matrix was significantly improved (see Fig. 9).123

Besides the ligand engineering approach, layer-by-layer assembly and surface polymerization are alternative ways to modify the particle surfaces to form water-soluble RENPs with other amphiphilic polymers, linear polyions and silanes. In addition, a silica shell is sometimes preferred for biomedical applications as it offers improved biocompatibility and bioavailability. Briefly, water-soluble RENPs are coated with a silica shell by using a modified Stöber process, where the hydrophobic surface is coated by a microemulsion technique. Additional chemical functional groups for binding other small molecules can be added using well-established silanization methods.124–126 (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and N-[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ethylenediamine (TPED) are typical short primary amines that are added to create an amine-modified silica shell that is later conjugated to biomolecules.127 Another possibility for surface functionalization is through the chemical modification of surface ligands via conjugation techniques to create the required chemical functional groups. For example, antibodies are usually attached to the surface of RENPs via their amine or carboxylic groups after active ester formation in the presence of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC). These groups are later used to conjugate with targeting moieties such as antibodies, small interfering RNA and folic acid.128
It is also worthwhile mentioning here that the combination of RENPs with other materials have been demonstrated to successfully merge the physical properties of multiple material classes, especially for theranostic purposes.129 For example, by growing a silver shell on RENPs, these nanomaterials can be used for both photothermal therapy and cell tracking via fluorescence imaging techniques.130
5. Applications
In this section, we briefly highlight some of the unique niche applications of RENPs. In particular, IR-based applications that involve either IR excitation or emission are emphasized. We have broadly grouped these IR-based applications based on the application requirement of the form of these RE doped materials. Generally, for many of the in vivo and in vitro biomedical applications, RENPs are used in their particulate form where having a small size is critical. The sensitivity of the probes for biomedical imaging is highly dependent on the emission brightness of these RENPs. For many integrated optical devices, especially for those in a flexible form, optically active nanostructured polymeric composites in a monolithic form that incorporates RENPs are needed. The energy efficiency of these devices would be dependent on the optical efficiency of the RENPs, as well as the RENP loading capacity and dispersion quality in the polymeric composites.
5.1. Applications of RENPs in particle form

5.1.1. Shortwave infrared fluorescent imaging. 
Imaging techniques have been instrumental in the identification and diagnosis of diseased states at the cellular, tissue and anatomical levels. Together with the advancements made in imaging techniques, it is critical for us to create complementary imaging probes or contrast agents to improve the visibility of the image by enhancing sensitivity, and for the identification and quantitation of specific molecular species or diseased lesions. Advances in detection depths and resolutions for optical imaging platforms have been made by successfully using RENPs to exploit the second ‘tissue-transparent window’ SWIR, where light absorption and scattering from tissue constituents (e.g., water, hemoglobin and melanin) are minimized. Compared to existing SWIR-emitting quantum dots which comprise toxic elements such as lead, mercury and arsenic, RENPs are relatively low in toxicity. Naczynski et al. successfully demonstrated real-time, multispectral in vivo SWIR imaging using a library of RENPs with tunable and discrete emission (see Fig. 10).6 This work presented a new generation of versatile IR nanoprobes that facilitate disease monitoring based on a minimally invasive IR imaging technique. Their results also highlighted the importance of the surface characteristics of RENPs for improving the biodistribution of these SWIR reporters. The unmodified RENPs exhibited severe aggregation at the injection site. In contrast, albumin-encapsulated RENPs were easily cleared from the injection site and systemically distributed. These albumin-encapsulated RENPs were later localized at the target tumor sites due to the enhanced permeation and retention effect, where particles with a size of <150 nm are known to be preferentially retained within tumors.

(b) SWIR imaging of unmodified RENPs (RE) and albumin encapsulated RENPs ((RE)ANCs) after intraperitoneal injection into a transgenic orthotopic murine melanoma model (TGS) over 72 h.

Treatment with fReANCs enabled detection of tumors on average 2.25 times smaller than those detected using ReANCs; (n = 6). Reproduced with permission from Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.131 
Improvements in imaging sensitivity to detect much smaller cancerous lesions (i.e. for earlier cancer detection) can be made with further surface functionalization of these nanoprobes with specific targeting moieties.131 Three key design features enable this enhancement in imaging sensitivity: (1) the relative tissue transparency afforded by these SWIR-emitting nanoprobes, (2) deeper tissue illumination potential using SWIR, and (3) high molecular specificity to cancerous lesion markers. Cancer targeting nanoprobes were prepared by passive adsorption on albumin-encapsulated RENPs with AMD3100, which is a hydrophobic small molecule inhibitor of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Compared with the unmodified RENPs without the albumin shell, CXCR4-targeted albumin-encapsulated RENPs were able to preferentially localize to the receptor-positive tumors in mice, allowing for the detection of positive tumors 4 times smaller than receptor-negative tumors (see Fig. 10).131 Most strikingly, these cancer targeted probes enabled imaging of microlesions (∼25 mm3) in the lungs at a depth of ∼1 cm while allowing for simultaneous molecular identification of the tumor population phenotype. The clinical significance of this study is the ability of functionalized nanoprobes to: (1) detect subtissue microlesions of ∼1 cm from the imaging surface, and (2) resolve microlesions as small as 18.9 mm3 when compared to 2.25 times larger lesions detected by albumin-encapsulated RENPs.131


5.1.2. Probes for multi-modal imaging. 
No single imaging modality is perfect and sufficient to obtain all of the necessary information at different spatial (e.g., anatomical, tissue and cellular) scales and resolution to address the questions from various communities. An emerging area to resolve this limitation is multi-modal imaging which integrates multiple imaging modalities to simultaneously capture visual information over many spatial scales. The combination of complementary imaging techniques offers: (1) cooperative synergy of the strengths for individual modality, (2) reduced data processing time with the co-registration of multiple signals instead of obtaining sequential images of independent modality, and (3) reduced exposure risks and inconvenience undertaken by subjects with a one-time contrast agent injection. The common strategy used to create probes to support multi-modal imaging platforms is through the synthesis of hybrid nanoparticles. These hybrid nanoparticles basically combine multiple types of inorganic materials that are traditionally used as probes for each imaging modality.
The unique intrinsic characteristics of RE elements (e.g., paramagnetic behavior and high X-ray absorption) present a unique opportunity for the development of contrast agents that complement multiple imaging modalities. RE elements have already been used in multiple imaging platforms, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), X-ray computed tomography (CT), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Consequently, a multi-modal contrast agent can potentially be designed based on the RE doped material without the need to create the hybrid nanoparticle that comprises of multiple types of inorganic materials, thereby avoiding the complexity of multiple processing steps. For example, a core–shell NaLuF4:Yb,Tm@NaGdF4-(153Sm) nanoparticle with four modal imaging abilities was reported (see Fig. 11).132 In their design, an MRI contrast signal was detected mostly from the Gd3+ located in the outer shell. Lutetium (Lu), a heavy RE element present in the core gave the CT contrast signal.133 Doping with Yb3+ and Tm3+ allowed for fluorescence signals to be detected (i.e. for optical imaging). Radioactive signals from 153Sm3+ enabled SPECT imaging. However, one of the engineering challenges limiting the wide implementation of multi-modal imaging techniques would be the actual integration of these imaging systems (e.g. MRI, CT and SPECT) as one physical platform.

Reproduced with permission from American Chemical Society.132 
The integration of an all optical-based imaging dual-modality platform was proposed for a non-invasive and inexpensive intraoperative system that can be easily adapted for surgical guidance (see Fig. 12).134 The optical-based imaging dual-modality platform integrates two compatible, well established imaging techniques: (1) fluorescence imaging, and (2) photoacoustic (PA) imaging. Fluorescence imaging, which detects the radiative emission from the nanoprobes, offers high temporal resolution. PA imaging that uses an optical pulse to generate an acoustic signal, which is registered by ultrasound devices, offers much higher spatial resolutions. The combination of these two imaging modes seeks to synergize the benefits of both techniques to achieve high temporal and spatial resolution. RENPs are well established as fluorescent probes with their sharp absorption and emission peaks that can be precisely tuned by changing the RE dopant and host chemistries for particles of any size. Just as part of this absorbed light is converted into radiative fluorescent emission, another portion is converted into other non-radiative energy forms that can be detected for PA imaging. Consequently, the lost non-radiative energy that was previously considered as unfavorable for fluorescent probes can now be harnessed to contribute to signal enhancement.

(b) Size-dependent PA signals for core RENPs (black dot and dot line) and core–shell RENPs (red dot and dot line). (c) Corresponding PA images of core–shell RENPs. All measurements were performed using a 50 MHz darkfield confocal PAM system with ∼4 ns laser pulses (975 nm) at a pulse repetition rate of 10 Hz. The concentration of all samples was 0.2 mmol mL−1 (scale bar: 100 μm). Reproduced with permission from American Chemical Society.134 
Typically, fluorescence and PA signals are complementary signal forms which result from radiative and non-radiative relaxations of electrons, respectively. Therefore, it is usually expected that materials exhibiting bright fluorescent emission would have weak PA signals, whilst weak fluorescent emission would be accompanied by strong PA signals. We have found that anisotropic PAA-modified RENPs exhibited both bright fluorescence emission and strong PA signals.104 RENPs also offer an untapped opportunity as PA contrast agents that can be excited with different wavelengths, including the IR where deeper tissue penetration can be reached. RENPs generally exhibit tunable absorption and emission wavelengths spanning the entire visible and IR region as mentioned in our earlier sections. Both the fluorescence emission and the PA signal amplitude can also be increased by controlling the size and manipulating the thickness of inorganic shell coating.134


5.1.3. Probes for luminescence-based thermometry. 
Temperature sensing and imaging in the microscopic region have been reported by remotely monitoring the changes in the temperature-dependent luminescent behavior of RENPs.135 The intercellular temperature was detected by measuring the change in fluorescence intensities of cells that have internalized these RENPs. The high temperature sensitive energy transitions that are commonly used for luminescence thermometry are 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (525 nm) and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (545 nm) of Er3+ ions. The ratio of the intensity of two of these emission bands (R) exhibits a dependence on the surrounding temperature as described by the following: (2)where In is the emission intensity from energy level n, A is a constant, ΔE21 is the energy gap between the excited energy levels of the two emissions, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. It should be noted that the energy gap, ΔE21, is not a constant and varies with temperature.


5.1.4. IR-activated photochemistry. 
For most photosensitive nanocarriers for light triggered drug release, photoreactions are commonly induced by UV or visible light. An alternative approach is to use tissue penetrating NIR light to trigger drug release by exploiting upconverting RENPs that emit in the UV and visible region (see Fig. 13).136 There are generally two requirements for RENP-assisted photochemistry. First, the IR excitation intensity needs to exceed a certain threshold for efficient UC. However, high-intensity IR light can cause overheating and photodamage to exposed areas. Second, a suitable photosensitive compound that absorbs upconverted light is required. To reduce excitation intensity for RENP-assisted photochemistry, ruthenium (Ru) complexes on SiO2 encapsulated RENP (UCNP@mSiO2–Ru) nanoparticles were designed. Photoactive molecular valves of blue-light-cleavable Ru complexes were grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. The required IR intensity was much lower since a three-photon process compared to the typical four-photon process is sufficient to create the required blue photons and to induce photocleavage. Subsequently, IR triggered drug release was successfully demonstrated. Comparing UCNP@mSiO2–Ru with other recently developed systems based on RENPs-assisted photochemistry shows that 0.35 W cm−2 is the lowest intensity reported.

5.2. Optically-active nanostructured polymeric composites
Integrating brightly emitting RENPs into polymeric matrices to obtain nanostructured composites has expanded the applications of RE doped materials. These polymeric composites serve as optically active components in various devices such as waveguides and flexible optoelectronic devices. To obtain highly emissive composites comprised of RENPs within a polymer matrix, the following design criteria are required: (1) bright-emitting RENPs, (2) high solid loadings, and (3) excellent particle dispersion in the polymer matrix. One of the common obstacles for fabricating highly emissive composites is the scattering loss that results from aggregation of RENPs especially under high solid loading. Therefore, it is critical to control the surface characteristics (e.g., hydrophilic, hydrophobic, or amphiphilic), as discussed in the earlier section, so as to achieve excellent particle dispersion.

5.2.1. Optical communication waveguide. 
IR-emitting RE doped materials have extensive applications in active integrated optical devices such as fiber amplifiers and waveguides for telecommunications, remote sensing, and optoelectronics. In particular, Er3+ and Nd3+ are of great interest as they emit in the third (1500 nm) and second (1300 nm) optical communication windows. The conventional ceramics waveguides are fabricated by incorporating RE ions into ceramic or glass materials using costly physical methods such as melt processing, molecular beam epitaxy, ion implantation or laser deposition. The low solubility and non-uniform distribution of RE ions in conventional ceramics and glasses limit the performance of such waveguides. An RENP dispersed polymer waveguide offers an attractive low cost solution compared to the costly conventional ones. The typical gain value reported using an RENP-based polymeric waveguide ranging from 0.1 to 5 dB cm−1 in various particle–polymer systems underscores the promise of these systems for the future integration with flexible integrated optical devices.137–140 For example, optical gain at 1535 nm was measured to be 3.08 dB cm−1 using Yb–Er–Ce RENPs mixed within SU8, a common polymer matrix used in optical devices (pump power 210 mW, input signal power 0.1 mW) (see Fig. 14).140

(c) Experimental setup for measuring the optical gain of the waveguide amplifier; Reproduced with permission from Optical Society of America.140 
Multiple factors including primary particle size, solid loading, particle dispersion uniformity, and refractive index mismatch between the particle and the polymer matrix are required to be finely tuned for fabricating high gain RENP-based polymeric waveguides. Surface modification is usually needed to improve RENP dispersion within polymers. Amphiphilic molecules with a long aliphatic chain like OA, dithiophosphate and H-POSS-PMMA have been used to give the nanoparticles a good solubility in organic solutions and polymer matrices.122,137,138 RENPs have been mixed with various polymer matrices such as PMMA,137 SU8,137,140 KMPR138 and 6F variant perfluorocyclobutyl (PFCB-6F)141,142 to fabricate polymer waveguide amplifiers (see Fig. 14). However, the solid loadings used in these studies were relatively low (∼0.1 vol%), which is a limitation for obtaining high gain and consequently highly efficient devices. It remains a challenge to prepare RENP doped polymer waveguides with high solid loading and low scattering losses. A method to prepare transparent composites with high solid loading (>5 vol%) is by matching the refractive index of the inorganic particle with low cost polymers like PMMA and polystyrene (PS).143 The minimized mismatch in the refractive index of RENPs and the polymer matrix is also beneficial for minimizing Rayleigh scattering, leading to the possibility of obtaining a highly emissive polymer composite with a high solid loading. Consequently, with these brightly emitting composites, the energy efficiency of the integrated optical device could be improved.


5.2.2. Photoconductors. 
The conventional materials used for converting photons to electrical signals are semiconductor materials with a direct- or indirect-band gap, such as silicon, germanium, and III–V materials. Within the full electromagnetic spectrum, NIR light detection exhibits extensive applications in night-vision imaging, biomedical imaging, security, and solar energy conversion.144–146 However, these conventional semiconductors have limited abilities to absorb IR photons due to their relatively large bandgap. Even though III–V semiconductors can be fine-tuned to absorb more NIR light, the cost of III–V materials is high due to the complex and costly physical deposition and epitaxial growth methods. To develop low cost and high performance photoelectric devices, light converters that convert low energy IR photons into high energy photons that can be absorbed by more types of low cost semiconductors are usually desired. Using this strategy, a new photonic flash memory device combining multilevel data storage and tunability has been developed using a composite composed of the polymer semiconductor poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and upconverting RENPs.147 IR light was used to manipulate the stored charges in the flash memory for the multilevel data storage through an active RENP doped P3HT layer. Similarly, a photoconductor device using an optically active nanostructured composite of NaYF4:Yb,Er RENPs and P3HT was fabricated, which exhibited a high conversion efficiency of NIR light to electrical signals (see Fig. 15).148 The high conversion efficiency was ascribed to the high UC efficiency of the light converting RENPs and the high solids loading (10 vol%) of RENPs in the composite film.

5.2.3. Solar cell. 
The efficient and cost-effective conversion of solar energy into electricity through photovoltaic cells remains a challenge task even though the significant development of the photovoltaic industry over the past decades. The main difficulty in improving the efficiency of photovoltaic energy conversion lies in the spectral mismatch between the energy distribution of photons in the incident solar spectrum and the bandgap of a semiconductor material. For example, crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells work most efficiently in the 950–1100 nm spectral region. The solar energy in the lower wavelength range (i.e., <950 nm) is non-efficiently absorbed due to the loss of the inherent thermalization of photon energies exceeding the Si bandgap, while the photon energy with a wavelength larger than 1100 nm is not sufficient for c-Si to absorb, leading to a waste of incident solar energy. These losses can be minimized using optical materials as spectral converters and the three luminescence processes including UC, DC and DS are currently explored for developing efficient photovoltaic devices.35 For example, ideal DC and DS optical materials for c-Si solar cells should convert high-energy (UV-blue) light into emission in the NIR region ∼1000 nm, while the most desirable upconverters for c-Si solar cells are able to absorb light above 1100 nm and convert it into emission around 1000 nm. Therefore, the photovoltaic efficiency of the c-Si solar cell is expected to be enhanced by efficiently utilizing these two parts of solar energy (i.e., <950 nm and <1100 nm). Trivalent RE ions are the prime candidates to achieve efficient spectral conversion because of their rich energy-level structure. Er3+ doped UC materials are the most promising upconverters for c-Si solar cells due to the ground-state absorption of Er3+ in the range of 1480–1580 nm and its four emission bands at 980 nm, 810 nm, 660 nm and 550 nm, which match well with the absorption of c-Si in solar cells. For example, an external quantum efficiency of 2.5% was obtained for the solar cell using NaYF4:Er (20 mol%) phosphors as the upconverters under excitation at 1523 nm using a 5.1 mW laser.149 In addition, a multilayer heterostructure of NaGdF4:Er@NaGdF4:Ho@NaGdF4 nanocrystals which are excited by ultra-broadband NIR photons transparent to c-Si and emit visible-NIR photons above the c-Si bandgap have been recently designed and fabricated.56 The use of a multilayer heterostructure not only extended the NIR wavelength range excitable for UC emission, but also allowed facile modulation of activator concentration while minimizing luminescence quenching induced between the Er3+ and Ho3+ ions by deleterious cross-relaxation. The combination of Er3+ and Yb3+ can also give rise to efficient visible-to-NIR quantum-cutting for c-Si solar cell absorption. For instance, Er3+–Yb3+ doped Cs3Y2Br9 phosphors gave rise to efficient visible-to-NIR quantum-cutting with an internal quantum efficiency of 195%.150

6. Summary and outlook
In this brief review, the photophysical mechanism leading to the distinctive atomic-like luminescence characteristics of RENPs was briefly introduced. This review also provides a summary overview of experimental strategies to tailor the luminescence characteristics, as well as control the physical and surface characteristics of RENPs. We have also highlighted some of the emerging niche IR-based applications of RE-based materials. Many of these applications have benefited from the versatility and tunability of RE-based materials to absorb IR photons and give rise to bright emission over a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, for many of these applications, the optical efficiency of these RENPs has to be improved quite significantly to maximize the full potential benefits. Besides seeking novel dopant schemes or particle heterostructures, it would be just as important to adopt a system-level approach to plan research efforts where the application requirements are considered from the start so as to design the material components (either in the form of particles or composite films) that will combine well with minimal interfacial and coupling losses. By minimizing these losses, improvements in the performance either as imaging probes (improved detection sensitivity) or optical devices (enhanced energy efficiency) are expected. These physical and technical limits of RENP-based materials as optically active components and the inadequacies of the current processes and device engineering must be addressed by interdisciplinary research efforts in processing technologies, microsystem engineering, nanotechnology and optics.
