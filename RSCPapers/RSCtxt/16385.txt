    , Accepted 16th January 2023First published on 17th January 2023AbstractThe field of small molecule electro-activated conversion is becoming a new star in modern catalytic research toward the carbon-neutral future. The advent of single-atom catalysts (SACs) is expected to greatly accelerate the kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), etc., owing to their maximum atomic efficiency, unique quantized energy level structure and strong interaction between well-defined active sites and supports. In this feature article, our group's proposed synthesis methodology applied in electrocatalysis is mainly summarized. Furthermore, we elaborate on how to achieve the stabilization of single metal atoms against migration and agglomeration during the preparation of SACs. Moreover, the electrochemical applications of SACs with a focus on the above heterogeneous reactions are presented. Finally, the prospects for the development and deficiencies of these SACs for electrocatalytic reactions are discussed.
1. Introduction
As thermal energy is being replaced with other types of energy to overcome the activation energy barrier inherent to any chemical transformation, traditional thermal catalysis has been expanded to other types of catalysis such as electrocatalysis,1–12 photocatalysis,13,14 plasma catalysis,15,16 and laser catalysis,17 just to mention a few. This shift, especially to electrocatalysis, is driven by the interest in substituting fossil fuels (which provide heat) with alternative renewable energy sources (like electricity, solar, wind, tidal, etc.). Synthesis of high value-added chemicals through electrocatalysis needs the exploitation of catalysts, which are capable of selective formation of desired products with minimum overpotential and maximum stability. Up to now, significant progress has been made in constructing high-performance electrocatalysts including pure metals, alloys, and metal complexes.18–22 However, the presence of electrocatalysts in bulk or nano-scale forms leads to inefficient atom economies and high costs that greatly limit their commercial application. Therefore, designing electrocatalysts on an atomic scale is the most promising way to make full use of each atom on the supported catalysts.
Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been among the most researched heterogeneous catalysts.23–49 Many theoretical and experimental efforts have been made to employ SACs dispersed on different carriers to achieve high selectivity and maximum metal usage in catalysis.50 The concept of SACs was first proposed by Zhang et al. in 2011.51 They synthesized a highly active and stable Pt1/FeOx catalyst for CO oxidation by the co-precipitation method. The structure of the Pt1/FeOx catalyst was precisely characterized by extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), which showed that the Pt atom was well segregated by O and Fe with a Pt–O coordination number of 1.9 and a Pt–Fe coordination number of 0.9. At that time, SACs attracted great attention in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, and a great deal of research has focused on controlled synthesis, advanced characterization, and applications, especially on electrocatalysis (water splitting, fuel cell, gas molecule electroreduction, organic molecule electrooxidation or electroreduction, etc.). The unique single sites with supports lead to many advantages in electrocatalysis, such as high utilization of metal atoms, high activity, selectivity, and stability.
In this feature article, we underlined our recent advances in synthesis strategies for SACs and addressed how to accomplish the atomic dispersion of metal precursors and stabilize the formed single atoms to prevent migration and aggregation, which are key to achieving SACs. Meanwhile, we concluded that SACs have great potential for application in electrocatalysis,2–4,6,52–58 including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), CO2 electroreduction reactions (CO2RR), and gas/organic molecule electrooxidation or electroreduction, etc., as summarized in Fig. 1. The presentation on the electrochemical applications of SACs mainly focuses on the origin of the superior electrocatalytic properties of SACs by relating them to their unique electronic and structural properties. The final section presents the major achievements in the field, and the challenges toward the full exploitation of SAC features in electrocatalysis.

2. Synthesis
Given the aggregation potential of individual metal atoms, it is imperative to explore effective preparation methods to establish strong interactions between SACs and supports. An extensive range of synthetic strategies have been employed so far to construct SACs for electrocatalysis, including chemical and physical methods. Specifically, chemical methods can be classified into bottom-up and top-down approaches depending on the starting precursor material. In the bottom-up synthetic pathway, strong interactions can be easily established, including co-precipitation, chemisorption, and galvanic replacement methods, which are the most frequently used methods to design SACs on supports. In contrast, top-down approaches can help produce SACs with bulk metals as precursors by the high-temperature pyrolysis-assisted breaking of the metal bonds. As for the other methods for immobilizing single atoms on supports, special equipment is often needed, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), light/electricity-assisted deposition, or ball-mill-assisted atomic deposition. Regardless of the synthetic strategies used to prepare the SACs, achieving atomically dispersed separation and isolation of precursors and preventing the as-formed single atoms from migration and agglomeration are still vital.
2.1 Bottom-up strategy for SAC synthesis
Earlier, the bottom-up strategy for SAC synthesis was the most common and broadly used approach for the synthesis of SACs because of its simplicity, reproducibility, and modularity. A representative impregnation and co-precipitation strategy for SACs consists of several steps: mixing of anionic and cationic solutions; nucleation and growth; agglomeration and precipitation; filtration; calcination or activation. The critical point is the loading of active metal precursors. To achieve atomic dispersion of the active site, ensuring sufficient space between the active metal atoms is the most straightforward and promising approach. However, low loading of active sites generally leads to a scarcity of catalytic centers and thus to poor electrocatalytic performance. In the same way, the selectivity of the support is also the focus for SAC fabrication by impregnation strategies. Promising supports should not only immobilize active sites by strong metal–support interactions, such as adsorption of the active metal on the surface, the introduction of an active metal into the interstices of the lattice, or replacement of the lattice atoms with active atoms, but should also conduct easily, stabilize the active sites, and perform rapid mass and electron transfer.
Based on the above analysis, our group synthesized a series of SACs for electrochemical application based on the bottom-up strategy method. Using metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursors to synthesize SACs is a representative example. As shown in Fig. 2a–d,59 SA-Rh/CN was constructed via a host–guest strategy. A zeolite imidazole framework with molecular-scale cages (ZIF-8) was used to disperse and immobilize Rh(acac)3 because the size of Rh(acac)3 (9.36 Å) is between the large cavity size (11.6 Å diameter) and the small pore size (3.4 Å diameter) of ZIF-8. Therefore, Rh(acac)3 can be trapped inside the molecular cage of ZIF-8. During pyrolysis, the precursor is reduced in situ to form SA-Rh/CN. From scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, we can see that the as-prepared samples have a rhombic dodecahedron morphology. High-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images exhibited no obvious Rh nanoparticles or clusters. Meanwhile, according to the aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM image (AC-HAADF-STEM) result, it was possible to identify isolated Rh single atoms by Z-contrast analysis. Moreover, we also adopted the same synthesis strategy to anchor Ir metal single atoms onto ZIF-8-derived nitrogen-doped carbon (Fig. 2e–h).60 We mixed Ir(acac)3/Zn(NO3)2 methanol solution with 2-methylimidazole methanol solution and encapsulated Ir(acac)3in situ within ZIF-8 during the crystallization of ZIF-8. And then, the obtained Ir(acac)3@ZIF-8 was subjected to pyrolysis at 900 °C to break down Ir(acac)3 and carbonized organic linkages leading to Ir single atoms on nitrogen-doped carbon determined from Fourier-transformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FE-EXAFS) analysis. During pyrolysis, the crystalline porous ZIF-8 structure acts as a molecular gate that isolates the Ir(acac)3 precursor spatially. The uniform dispersion of Ir(acac)3 within ZIF-8 prevents the collision and aggregation of Ir atoms during the ZIF-8 pyrolysis. In addition, the in situ formation of nitrogen-doped carbon supplies rich coordination sites for the stabilization of Ir atoms.

Apart from a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix derived from pyrolysis of ZIF-8, our group also developed other supports to synthesize SACs, and many interesting phenomena were discovered. For example, in the field of photocatalysis, we successfully designed the P–N and Cu–N4 dual active moieties constructed on carbon nitride nanosheets to achieve highly efficient separation of charge carriers for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to yield C2H6.61 Meanwhile, we developed a facile Cu–N4 and C–S–C dual atomic site strategy to simultaneously achieve the highly efficient separation of photo-generated electrons and holes in the p-CN matrix.62 Moreover, by establishing the interaction of Cu species with the –NH2 groups of UiO-66-NH2, we report a photoinduction method to construct isolated Cu SAs anchored on UiO-66-NH2 as a robust photocatalyst for the conversion of CO2 to CH3OH.63 Generally speaking, the bottom-up strategy for SAC synthesis utilizes defects to capture metal precursors, particularly metal ions, and protects against sintering by enhancing the charge transfer mechanism between single atoms and defect sites to stabilize isolated metal atoms. It can help adjust the metal loading content of the SAC by manipulating the density of defects. The existence of defects on the support facilitates the formation of unique atomic structures for improved catalytic performance.
2.2 Top-down strategy for SAC synthesis
Atoms are mobile at elevated temperatures. Depending on the temperature, metal, and atmosphere, the mobile atoms tend to aggregate to form nanoclusters or nanoparticles. This aggregation process (oswald ripening) is thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures and is the main cause of catalyst sintering. Therefore, reverse oswald ripening, the dispersal of nanoparticles into individual atoms, is unfavorable and only occurs when the evaporated atoms are strongly bound to the supports after the nanoparticles have been evaporated into atoms. The above methodology for the preparation of SACs is known as the top-down strategy. The CeO2 support employed to trap mobile metal atoms at elevated temperatures was reported by Jones et al.64 On heating Pt nanoparticles in the air at high temperatures, they observed that mobile Pt atoms from the nanoparticles could survive on CeO2 at high temperatures under oxidizing conditions. The mobile Pt atoms are trapped by the CeO2 support, forming Pt single atoms. Since then, our group has strongly developed top-down methodologies for SAC synthesis, especially in the MOF system. Specifically, we achieved the growth of ZIF-8 nanocrystals on Pd-NPs by combining solution of Pd-NPs and Zn(NO3)2 with a 2-methylimidazole solution, where the ZIF-8 crystals can grow around Pd-NPs to form Pd-NPs@ZIF-8 composites. Then the Pd-NPs@ZIF-8 nanocomposites were thermally treated at 900 °C for 3 h under an inert atmosphere, after which the Pd-NPs disappeared. We decreased the pyrolysis time and observed the intermediate products using HAADF-STEM. During the first 0.5 h of heating, the crystalline Pd-NPs became increasingly large and the size distribution became not uniform. After 1.5 h, the number of nanoparticles decreased significantly and the crystalline Pd nanoparticles converted to the amorphous state. As shown in Fig. 3a, with the prolonged pyrolysis time (3 h), the remaining nanoparticles completely disappeared in the matrix.65 The fundamental reason is that the formation of a single Pd atom in the N4 defect from the decomposition of nanoparticles requires a lower barrier to be overcome compared to sintering at high temperatures (900–1000 °C). Meanwhile, this is the first time that our group has used in situ electron microscopy to directly observe the process of monoatomization of nanoparticles (Pd, Pt, and Au-NPs). Furthermore, we have also established a novel solid-state atom replacement conversion technique for metal catalysts, by which metal atoms are exchanged between single atoms and nanoalloys to form a new set of nanoalloys and single atoms. As illustrated in Fig. 3b, if the Pd nanoparticles were replaced with PtNi nanoalloys, we found that the PtNi nanoalloys of Ni and ZIF-8-derived Zn1 on nitrogen-doped carbon underwent metal interchanges to produce PtZn nanocrystals and Ni single atoms at high temperatures. The elemental migration and chemical bonding evolution during the atomic substitution at high temperatures show the formation of new alloys PtZn as well as Ni SACs in the NC matrix.66 In addition to the construction of SACs in the ZIF-8 system, we also prepared SACs in other MOF materials by the top-down strategy. We prepared single Bi atomic site electrocatalysts in N-doped carbon networks by in situ pyrolysis of Bi-MOFs and dicyandiamide. The decomposition of dicyandiamide not only releases NH3 to boost the atomization of Bi nanoparticles but also gives rise to electrical conductivity to generate N-doped porous carbon to improve the BET surface area and porosity of the catalyst. TEM analysis shows that Bi-MOFs are first converted into Bi nanoparticles (Fig. 3c), and then Bi nanoparticles are converted into single Bi atoms with the help of NH3 produced by the decomposition of dicyandiamide.67 In addition to the abovementioned MOF-derived NC synthesis systems, our group also tried to explore metal oxides to prepare SACs by a top-down strategy. As displayed in Fig. 3d, Ag NPs intensively collided with the pristine MnO2 nanowires and caused surface reconstruction of MnO2 with a temperature rise, gradually decreasing in size until vanishment from the surface of the matrix. Furthermore, by combining the density functional theory (DFT) calculations with TEM and XRD simulation results, it can be inferred that Ag atoms could be trapped by O atoms from the (310) lattice plane of MnO2 to form Ag1/MnO2.68

In short, compared to the bottom-up strategy for SAC synthesis, employing a high temperature strategy supplies the activation energy for atomic dispersion by forming thermodynamically favorable metal-defect bonds. The favorable metal defect bonds and the off-state greatly ensure the overall stability, especially for the substrate. The resulting high-temperature single atoms showed excellent thermal stability as durable catalysts. Our reported top–down method is simple, ultra-fast, and versatile, achieving Pd, Ni, and Bi single atoms on NC, C3N4, and CeO2 substrates, which helps pioneer a routinely challenging route for the fabrication of thermally stable SACs.
2.3 Another ingenious strategy for SAC synthesis
In modern times, many novel physical methods have been proposed to prepare SACs including CVD, atomic layer deposition (ALD), ball-mill-assisted atomic deposition, and so on. In the year 2021, our group reported highly dispersed single V atoms on 1T-WS2 monolayers, which are synthesized through one-step CVD via controlling the introduction of VCl3. Fig. 4a shows the scheme for the growth of V SACs@1T-WS2 monolayers using WO3, S, and VCl3 as the co-precursors. By using VCl3 as the co-precursor, the metallic WS2 monolayers show an ultrahigh 1T concentration of 91%, which is the highest 1T ratio achieved by CVD so far.69 The ALD technique is another emerging preparation method to design and prepare SACs with atomic-level control. In general, the typical ALD technique includes four steps (Fig. 4b). First, the precursor vapor is pulsed into a chamber, where it interacts with the substrate. Next, the unreacted precursors and reaction by-products are cleaned with inert gas and/or evacuated under a high vacuum. The remaining ligands of the first precursor are then typically removed to regenerate the active sites on the surface of the deposited material for the next ALD cycle. Finally, the second precursor vapor and by-product residues are purged with inert gas and/or evacuated under a high vacuum to complete an ALD cycle.70 In 2013, Sun and co-workers for the first time used the ALD technique to synthesize a series of Pt species, including Pt SACs, clusters, and nanoparticles, with various morphologies, sizes, density values, and loadings through simple adjustments of ALD cycles.71 In the background of greening the environment, researchers have recently suggested a ball-mill-assisted atomic deposition method to fabricate SACs. High-energy ball mills can easily enable the preparation of new compounds by breaking the chemical bonds of metal precursors. The broken undercoordinated chemical bonds then tend to reconfigure and interconnect to form new compounds, which are widely used in the synthesis of SACs. These SACs are obtained by ball milling without the use of any synthetic chemicals and solvents, and no waste is generated during the entire process. As reported in the study by Baek and co-workers,72 they have achieved a direct synthesis of SACs from bulk metals, N2 and graphite as precursors by ball-mill-assisted atomic deposition (Fig. 4c and d). No synthetic solvents or chemicals (including water) are involved in the preparation process; thus, no by-products or wastes are formed. In brief, the ball-milling method is a high-efficiency and environmentally friendly approach for synthesizing SACs on the large scale.

3. Electrocatalytic applications
Owing to their maximum atomic efficiency, unique quantized energy level structure, and strong interaction between well-defined active sites and supports, single-atom catalysis has become one of the most active research frontiers in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, especially in electrocatalysis. In this feature article, mainly combined with the single-atom catalysts reported by our group, we present and summarize the electrochemical applications of SACs in key energy conversion reactions, such as HER, OER, ORR, and CO2RR, etc., to illustrate the great promise of SACs in achieving efficient and selective electrochemical processes. Besides, we discuss the relationship between the structure and performance of SACs and the catalytic mechanism.
3.1 Water splitting
As an alternative to traditional fossil energy sources, H2 is considered a promising candidate for a new type of energy storage and conversion. H2 offers many advantages, including the highest gravimetric energy density and zero greenhouse gas emissions. Traditionally, H2 has been produced from steam reforming of CH4 or gasification of coal, resulting in significant greenhouse gas emissions. Compared to other methods, H2 production by water splitting is a sustainable approach. In general, hydrolysis consists of HER at the cathode and OER at the anode. To assess the performance of the HER, both theoretical and experimental results have shown that the adsorption-free energy of H* is a very important performance indicator for evaluating HER electrocatalysts, especially in acidic environments. Pt noble metal has been recognized as the best HER electrocatalyst, while the low retention rate and high cost have limited its large-scale application in industry. The search for a highly efficient electrocatalyst with no contamination in the catalytic HER is a primary consideration for researchers. SACs, which have great potential, have recently been widely used for hydrogen production.73,74 Therefore, we outline our latest achievements of SACs in the field of HER.
We have shown a direct synthesis of single-atom V sites on the high-purity 1T-WS2 monolayers via a one-step CVD strategy by introducing VCl3 as a co-precursor. Specifically, the V SACs@1T-WS2 monolayers show superior HER activity compared to their 2H counterparts, with a low Tafel slope of 61 mV dec−1 and a high turnover frequency of 3.01 s−1 at 100 mV, and an extraordinary long-term catalytic stability in acid solutions (Fig. 5a–c). DFT calculations highlight that the highly activated V-atom sites are primarily responsible for the excellent HER activity of V SACs@1T-WS2 monolayers.69 Furthermore, we herein developed a strategy for establishing electronic metal–support interaction between Rh and TiC to design the SACs with high activity. The SACs of Rh1-TiC were synthesized and displayed ultra-low overpotential (22 mV at 10 mA cm−2), fast kinetic process (a Tafel slope of 25 mV dec−1) and high mass activity (54403.9 mA cm−2 mg−1), which exceeded those of the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C (Fig. 5d–i). In addition, the catalyst also exhibited good stability to the HER at a realistic current density (500 mA cm−2). Under operating conditions (2 kA m−2), Rh1-TiC realized about 20% lower power consumption compared to Pt/C, demonstrating the reliable application of Rh1-TiC in practical HER.75 Both of the above two studies have achieved efficient HER with SACs in acidic environments. We have also designed catalysts with single Mo atoms supported on N-doped carbon having outstanding HER performance with a low overpotential (onset overpotential 13 mV, and overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, 132 mV) and a small Tafel slope (90 mV dec−1) under alkaline conditions. The structure of the catalyst was probed by AC-STEM and XAFS, indicating the formation of Mo single atoms anchored with one nitrogen atom and two carbon atoms (Mo1N1C2). Additionally, DFT calculations of the unique catalytic properties of Mo1N1C2 are key for the perfect HER performance.76

Accounting for the other half of the hydrolysis reaction, the OER is dynamically slow compared to the HER, and therefore it is the determining factor for the overall water splitting. Today, the broadly used commercial OER catalysts are IrO2 and RuO2. Promising alternatives with high performance, low cost, and abundant reserves are also needed for large-scale applications. Recently, the availability of SACs has brought dawn for the preparation of OER catalysts. First, the high utilization of metal centers can greatly reduce the use of precious metals; second, the atomically dispersed active sites can provide the same activity and high selectivity for OER catalysts. We designed a carbon-supported Mn single-atom bifunctional catalyst through an atomic interface strategy. Because of the strong interplay between Mn atoms and the carbon matrix, Mn SACs exhibited outstanding activity in alkaline media, with a low OER overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Additionally, the bond-length-shortened high-valence Mn4+-N2C2 moieties acted as catalytic sites during the OER.77 Furthermore, more acidic OER catalyst designs are under development by our group. And we concluded the several recent significant breakthroughs for the design and synthesis of SACs toward acid OER. Ma and co-workers reported a CoO catalyst incorporated with Ir single atoms, prepared by a mechanochemical approach.78 Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrates that Ir atoms are partially oxidized to active Ir>4+ during the OER; meanwhile, Ir and Co atoms with their bridged electrophilic O ligands act as active sites. Ir single atom–loaded Co3O4 catalysts show a significant OER overpotential of 236 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in acidic media, which is markedly lower than that of the prepared Co3O4 (412 mV) catalyst. Notably, both the normalized mass activity and TOF of Ir-Co3O4 can reach nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of commercial IrO2 at an overpotential of 300 mV, respectively. Also, the stability of Co3O4 can be extended for a much longer period after adding Ir single atoms to its lattice. Wang and co-workers developed a Ni-stabilized, RuO2 catalyst, a promising alternative to Ir, with high activity and durability in acidic OER for PEM water electrolysis.79 Their Ni-RuO2 catalyst showed stable water electrolysis of >1000 h at 200 mA cm−2, suggesting its great potential for practical water-splitting applications.
3.2 Fuel cells
Not only proton exchange membrane fuel cells, but also alkaline membrane exchange membrane fuel cells have attracted rapidly growing attention owing to their high power density, high energy-convention efficiency, fast start-up, and zero carbon footprints. As the ORR at the cathode is extremely sluggish compared to the HOR at the anode, the cathode materials (Pt) contribute more to the overall cost. The high cost and rare abundance of Pt limit their commercial applications on a large scale. Lowering the usage of Pt to the atomic level or employing non-Pt catalysts can greatly solve the above issues fundamentally.80 For example, we have achieved continuous, highly controllable modification of the electronic structure and intrinsic activity of Fe SACs for the first time through p–n junction rectification. Using FePc/GaS as a model, our structural characterization in terms of atomic geometry shows that rectification leads to significant deformation of the FeN4 molecule and destabilization of the Fe–N coordination. This p–n junction catalyst displays more than 2-fold and 12-fold higher ORR activity (Fig. 6a–c) than pristine FePc and commercial Pt/C at 0.85 V relative to RHE, respectively.81 We demonstrated that nonmagnetic Mo6+ atomically dispersed in an oxide lattice directs the intrinsic activity of the catalytically active site by trapping extrinsic electrons in its 3d orbitals. We first selected La2CoMnO6 as a model catalyst and incorporated it with a low dose of nonmagnetic Mo6+ as an electron trap, thus ensuring its original lattice ordering and ferromagnetism. This atomic-level Mo dispersion produced additional high-spin Mn3+(t32ge1g) as a catalytically active site and induced highly conductive Co2+(e2g)–O–Mn3+(e1g) double exchange channels. As a direct consequence, the Mo1/La2CoMnO6 catalyst provides a more than 5-fold increase in ORR activity for RHE at 0.85 V (Fig. 6d–i) compared to the pristine catalyst.82 Besides the two non-carbon-based systems mentioned above, our group has worked more on the dispersion of single atoms in carbon-based carriers, achieving efficient ORR catalysis under alkaline conditions.77,83–89 For acid ORR, most reported SAC catalysts (only single active sites without nanoparticles) exhibited rapid activity decay up to 40–80% under potentiostatic operation conditions with only dozens of hours in PEMFCs.90 More strategies tend to combine Pt-based alloys and single-atom catalysts synergistically to achieve an efficient ORR under acid conditions.91–93 As for ORR, the majority of the electrochemical ORR proceeds through a direct four-electron transfer pathway by reducing O2 to OH– or H2O as final products in a basic or acidic solution. However, the rest of the electrochemical ORR proceeds with two-electron transfer by reducing O2 to H2O2. Due to the huge industrial demand, the synthesis of H2O2via the electrochemical method is promising. We have fabricated a novel catalyst consisting of single In atoms by rational coordination engineering and it was precisely modulated by first coordination with N and S, and second coordination with B in the hollow carbon rods, respectively. The In SACs/NSBC exhibits a high H2O2 selectivity of above 95% in a wide range of pH (Fig. 6j–o). Moreover, the In SACs/NSBC-modified natural air diffusion electrode exhibits an unprecedented production rate of 6.49 H2O2 gcatalyst−1 h−1 in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte and 6.71 mol H2O2 g catalyst−1 h−1 in 0.1 M PBS electrolyte.94 DFT calculations demonstrate that In SACs/NSBCs have optimized electronic structures with higher adsorption energies for key OOH* intermediates, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect between the first-coordinated N and S, and second-coordinated B as well as an individual In atoms, leading to accelerated reaction kinetics and improved catalytic 2e ORR performance.

In a typical proton exchange membrane fuel cell, both anodic hydrogen oxidation reactions and both the cathodic ORR and anodic HOR utilize Pt-based electrocatalysts. The anode only requires a low Pt loading due to its fast reaction kinetics. However, with the renaissance of alkaline membrane exchange membrane fuel cells, the reaction rate of the HOR in an alkaline environment on Pt is much slower than under acid conditions. Thus, the HOR is the limiting reaction requiring more active electrocatalysts that Pt. Pan and co-workers designed a distinctive Ru-based catalyst anchored with atomically dispersed Cr coordinated with hydroxyl clusters for accelerated HOR kinetics. Meanwhile, the isolated Cr1(OH)x clusters, as a co-catalyst, can help maximize the number of interfacial active sites and create abundant active oxygen species for optimizing the H binding energy and promoting hydrogen or CO spillover from Ru to Cr1(OH)x. Consequently, the HOR activity of Ru–Cr1(OH)x was 50 times higher than that of unmodified Ru. Furthermore, the isolated Cr1(OH)x clusters also facilitated the removal of CO molecules and inhibited the aggregation of Ru species during the HOR, thus providing favorable CO tolerance and long-life performance.95
3.3 Gas molecule electrooxidation or electroreduction
Due to the similarity between gas molecules (CO2/CO/N2/C2H2/NO etc.), in this feature article, we use CO2 gas molecules as a representative to summarize their results in electrocatalytic conversion. In general, the conversion of CO2 follows three steps: (1) adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst surface; (2) carrier transfer and electron migration to the CO2 adsorption site; and (3) activation and reduction of CO2, a difficult process due to the kinetic and thermodynamic hindrance of CO2 molecules. Kinetically, a CO2 molecule has a non-polar, linearly symmetric structure in which the electron cloud density of the double oxygen atoms is uniformly distributed, resulting in a stable CO2 molecular structureand a high CO2 activation barrier.96 Thermodynamically, CO2 conversion is an endothermic process that requires energy from the environment and must overcome a competing reaction (HER).96 In particular, the thermodynamic potential for activation of CO2 to CO2*− is around −1.44 V (relative to NHE, pH = 0), which is larger than the ideal value for CO2 reduction. All the obstacles mentioned above can be overcome by tuning the structures and properties of the CO2RR electrocatalysts. Up to now, enormous efforts have been made to prepare high-efficiency CO2RR electrocatalysts, especially SACs.1,5,14,66–68,97–102 We found that the Ni of the PtNi nanoalloy and the Zn of the ZIF-8-derived Zn1 on nitrogen-doped carbon experienced metal interchange to produce PtZn nanocrystals and Ni single atoms at high temperature. Due to the synergistic effect of PtZn nanocrystals and Ni1-CN, the obtained (PtZn)n/Ni1-CN multisite catalysts show lower energy barriers for CO2 protonation and CO desorption in the CO2RR than the reference catalyst, resulting in a greatly enhanced catalytic performance of the CO2RR for CO (Fig. 7a–e).66 Moreover, we also rationally designed a new In single-atom catalyst containing exclusive isolated Inδ+-N4 atomic interface sites for CO2 electroreduction to HCOOH with high efficiency. This catalyst exhibits an extremely large turnover frequency up to 12500 h−1 at −0.95 V vs. RHE, with an FE for HCOOH of 96% and a current density of 8.87 mA cm−2 at a low potential of −0.65 V vs. RHE.101 Besides the common CO and HCOOH products, the SACs we designed also achieved excessive hydrogenation of CO2 to CH4 products. We present a novel tandem catalyst comprising Ir single-atom-doped hybrid Cu3N/Cu2O multisites that operates efficiently in converting CO2 to CH4. The catalyst displays a high faradaic efficiency of 75% for CH4 with a current density of 320 mA cm−2 in a flow cell. Theoretical calculation results reveal that Ir1 facilitates water dissociation into a proton and feeds it to the hybrid Cu3N/Cu2O sites for the *CO protonation pathway toward *CHO (Fig. 7f–i).98 Furthermore, N-heterocyclic carbene-ligated Cu single atom sites embedded in a metal–organic framework have been constructed, which can achieve an outstanding FE of 81% for the CO2 reduction to CH4 at −1.5 V vs RHE with a current density of 420 mA cm−2. Remarkably, the CH4 FE of our catalysts remained above 70% over a wide potential range and an unprecedented turnover frequency of 16.3 s−1 was achieved, showing that the catalysts are the best molecular catalyst for CH4 electrosynthesis to date.99 Apart from CO2 molecules, the electroreduction or electrooxidation of other gas molecules with SACs is still in progress.

3.4 Organic molecule electrooxidation or electroreduction
Direct liquid fuel cells are attracting an increasing interest due to their high energy density, instant charging capability, simple cell structure, and ease of storage and transportation. The major challenge for the commercialization of direct liquid fuel cells is the high loading requirement of Pt group metals as catalysts. In the past decades, the most efficient catalysts for the electrooxidation reaction of small organic molecules were nanoparticles of noble metals, especially Pt and Pd. However, the electrooxidation reaction occurs only on the metal surface, and the inaccessible metal atoms inside these Pt-based nanoparticles are inactive and wasteful. The most suitable nanoparticle size has been reported to be 3–5 nm.103 Fortunately, single atomic dispersed catalysts have recently become a focus for fabricating direct liquid fuel cells due to their well-defined active sites, high selectivity, maximum atom utilization, and anti-poisoning properties. In this feature article, different types of fuels used in direct liquid fuel cells such as CH3OH, C2H5OH, and HCOOH were discussed.80 We reported an atomically dispersed Ir or Rh on an N-doped carbon catalyst via a host–guest fabrication strategy by selecting zeolitic imidazolate frameworks with molecular-scale cages as a template. Interestingly, compared with no obvious HCOOH oxidation reaction activity of Rh or Ir nanoparticle supported carbon, the single atom catalyst shows an excellent mass activity, much higher than that of commercial Pd/C and Pt/C catalysts, respectively, as well as great durability (Fig. 8a–h). In addition, the CO-resistance experiments exhibit that the SACs can inhibit the dehydration of HCOOH, eliminating CO poisoning in direct liquid fuel cells and oxidizing HCOOH toward direct dehydrogenation.59,60 Compared with HCOOH electrooxidation, the CH3OH oxidation reaction and C2H5OH oxidation reaction are more complex and complicated because of their reaction pathway and many intermediate by-products. We used the Pt-based nanocrystals covered with high-indexed facets as supports to anchor the monodispersed Ga sites to construct single-atomic Ga-tailored Pt-based catalysts. The Ga single atoms loaded on Pt3Mn nanocatalysts exhibit an excellent C2H5OH oxidation reaction performance (4.71 mA cm−2) achieving 3.68 and 8.41 times specific activity compared to that of Pt3Mn and commercial Pt/C.104 Tilley and co-workers presented a synthetic approach for achieving single Pt atoms on the surface of metal Ru nanoparticles, which show high acid CH3OH electrocatalytic performance. Specifically, the single-Pt-atom-on-Ru catalyst has a high capacitance-corrected geometric current density of 14.3 mA cm−2 of the working electrode at a potential of only 0.7 V, which is 3.1 times greater than that of the Pt-island-on-Ru catalyst and 4.7 times and 13 times greater than that of the commercial PtRu and Pt catalysts, respectively.105 Based on the above results, the atomic SACs are very suitable for direct liquid fuel cells.

4. Conclusions
In this feature article, we summarized our recent advances in synthesis strategies for SACs and addressed how to accomplish the atomic dispersion of metal precursors and stabilize the formed single atoms to prevent migration and aggregation, which are the key to achieving SACs. And, we elaborated on the ultimate principle of every method, as well as the corresponding merit and demerit in brief. Next, we discussed specific examples to highlight the potential applications of SACs in electrocatalysis. So far, many advanced electrocatalytic systems greatly rely on the utilization of precious metal electrocatalysts. Enhancing the efficiency of metal atom utilization is a promising approach to reduce the consumption of precious metals. Reducing the consumption of precious metals, which is essential for reducing catalyst costs and promoting sustainability, SACs represent the minimum size limit to achieve maximum atomic utilization, which holds great promise for achieving rational use of metal resources and promoting sustainability. Fully exposed active sites, unique electronic structures, and enhanced metal–support interaction endow SACs with enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Meanwhile, the structural simplicity and the homogeneity of SACs allow for precise structural identification of the active sites, which provides a broad opportunity to study electrochemical processes and mechanisms on an atomic scale with a combination of experiments and theory. However, despite the tremendous progress that has been made, further developments in the following areas have been identified as key to advancing the practical implementation of SACs in recent decades: (1) improving the stability of SACs, especially at high metal loading or high reaction temperature, to meet industrial needs; (2) regulation of the coordination environment; (3) accurate identification of active centers; (4) the dynamic evolution of active sites of SACs; and (5) implementation in practical electrochemical devices. With these successes, we are expected to design specific catalysts for target reactions and achieve atomically economical green electrocatalytic processes.
