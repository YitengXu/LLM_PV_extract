    , Accepted 28th March 2023First published on 29th March 2023AbstractIn recent years, the innovative design of small-molecule non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), in particular fused ring electron acceptors (FREAs), has greatly promoted the development of organic solar cells (OSCs), with PCEs higher than 19% to date. However, there is still a certain efficiency gap compared to inorganic and perovskite solar cells, mainly due to the large energy loss (Eloss) in OSCs. Impressively, symmetry breaking of FREAs has recently emerged as an effective molecular design strategy to reduce the Eloss to a remarkably low value of 0.44 eV. Thus, in this perspective, we carefully summarize the recently encouraging progress of asymmetric FREAs and try to show a picture of the relationship between the asymmetric molecular structure, Eloss, and the device performance. Moreover, molecular insights for the future development of high performance asymmetric NFAs are also provided.

1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have developed rapidly in the past decade due to their great advantages of low cost, light weight, flexibility, tunable material structure, and large-area solution printing preparation.1–4 At present, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs has exceeded 19%,5–7 attributed to the continuously innovative molecular design of both donor and acceptor materials, new optimization methods for BHJ film morphology, and new protocols of device engineering.8–12 Nonetheless, the PCE of OSCs still lags far behind those of crystalline silicon13 and perovskite solar cells,14 mainly due to the large energy loss (Eloss).15 So far, even for the state-of-the-art OSCs, the Eloss mostly remains above 0.5 eV.16–18 In sharp contrast, the Eloss of crystalline silicon solar cells is only 0.36 eV,19 while that of perovskite solar cells can even reach 0.30 eV,20 both of which are close to the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit (0.25–0.30 eV).21 Thus, developing effective strategies to reduce the Eloss of OSCs is quite imperative for their further PCE development.
Typically, the Eloss of single-junction OSCs can be described by the equation listed below:  where q and Eg represent the elementary charge and the optical gap of the solar cell, respectively. The qVSQOC is the predicted maximum voltage based on the SQ limit,22,23 and the VredOC is the open-circuit voltage (VOC) assuming only radiative recombination occurs in the cell. The ΔVred,belowgapOC corresponds to the Eloss induced by the radiative recombination below Eg, while ΔVnon-redOC is Eloss originating from the nonradiative recombination (NRR). In short, the Eloss in OSCs can be separated into three parts (Fig. 1a): (1) ΔE1 refers to the radiative recombination energy loss above Eg, which is inevitable for any type of solar cell; (2) ΔE2 is assigned as the radiative recombination energy loss below Eg, which is negligible for inorganic and perovskite solar cells due to their steep absorption edges, but is more pronounced for OSCs, attributed to the large energetic disorder, presence of tail states, as well as the absorption of the charge transfer (CT) state; (3) ΔE3 represents the NRR loss at the BHJ donor/acceptor (D/A) interface, which is given by the equation below:24ΔE3 = −kBTln(EQEEL)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and EQEEL is the external electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiency of OSCs. In an ideal diode, EQEEL = 1 and thus ΔE3 = 0. But in practice, an order of magnitude decrease in EQEEL will increase the voltage loss by 58 mV at room temperature.15

As is well known, the photogenerated hole–electron pairs for organic semiconductors are localized Frenkel-type excitons with a large binding energy, which therefore require sufficient driving force to sustain efficient exciton dissociation.25,26 A large energy offset of over 0.3 eV is required at the D/A interface for fullerene-based BHJ OSCs due to the large energetic disorder of fullerene acceptors and the energetically broadened CT absorption.27–29 As a result, a considerable ΔE2, up to 0.67 eV,30 often exists for fullerene-based OSCs, which is one of the major reasons for their best PCEs being limited to ∼12%.31 Impressively, the innovative design of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), in particular fused ring electron acceptors (FREAs), has enabled a significant decrease of ΔE2, as the exciton dissociation can be realized at a low driving force, benefitting from the easily adjustable energy levels of NFAs and their extended exciton lifetime.32,33 In recent years, the PCE record of OSCs has been continuously broken,11,34 with a certificated value of 19.2% achieved in a ternary OSC.6 Nevertheless, one of major drawbacks of NFAs lies in their anisotropic structure, which always results in less ordered molecular packing and weakened π–π intermolecular interactions.15 What's more, the charge transfer and transport will also have a negative effect, resulting in a large NRR loss associated ΔE3. At present, it has been widely deemed that ΔE3 contributes to most of the Eloss for NFA-based OSCs.
Undoubtedly, the recently encouraging PCE improvement of OSCs should be attributed to the emergence of unique FREAs, in which an electron-rich fused ring core is typically end-capped by two electron-deficient units to form an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure with strong intramolecular charge transfer.32,35,36 As reported, A–D–A type ITIC-like acceptors37 have reached PCEs more than 16%38 with a normal Eloss range of 0.5–0.7 eV,39–50 while for A–DA′D–A-type Y6 acceptors,51 the PCEs have been further pushed beyond 18% with more reduced Eloss, mainly due to their distinctive and compact three-dimensional (3D) network packing structure.18,52–56 These results strongly imply that the molecular structures of NFAs and their molecular packing behaviors in the solid state play critical roles in determining the Eloss and the final device performance. In this regard, new structural optimization strategies for FREAs have been continuously explored to further reduce the Eloss,15,57 among which symmetry breaking has recently been proven as an effective strategy. Compared to the symmetric structure, asymmetric structural design can endow the resulting FREAs with a larger dipolar moment and an enhanced intermolecular binding energy, leading to intensified intermolecular interactions and increased packing order, both of which are desired for suppressing NRR loss.58–60 Moreover, combining different functional groups in constructing asymmetric FREAs provides more possibilities of tuning their structure, aggregation behaviors, as well as photophysical and charge transport properties. Fig. 1b presents a relationship of PCE versus Eloss of A–D–A and A–DA′D–A type FREAs with a symmetric and asymmetric structure, which directly indicates that asymmetric acceptors have more promising potential for reducing Eloss, and the lowest value of 0.44 eV has been achieved. Thus, this perspective focuses on the representative advances of using the symmetry breaking strategy to reduce Eloss of FREAs.
2. Symmetry breaking design strategy for FREAs
As shown in Fig. 1c, the structure of FREAs generally consists of four components including a conjugated core, terminal group, side chain and π-bridge. Modification of each component can have specific impacts on material properties and the photovoltaic performance. In this context, the symmetry breaking design of FREAs has been carried out separately from these four components, including an asymmetric conjugated core design, asymmetric terminal group design, asymmetric side chain design and asymmetric π-bridge design. Here, we will discuss these representative asymmetric design strategies, and the detailed material properties and device performance data of asymmetric FREAs mentioned in this manuscript are summarized in Table 1. In addition, the structures of the paired polymer donors i.e. PBDB-T and PM6 are presented in Fig. 1d.

2.1. Asymmetric conjugated core design
From the name “fused ring”, it can be easily concluded that the conjugated core is one of the most important components in the structure of FREAs. This is because the length, shape, and heteroatomic units of conjugated core effectively affect the major material properties of the resulting FREAs, such as absorption, energy levels, molecular crystallinity, and so on.35 Thus, these properties can be effectively tuned to reduce the Eloss by using an asymmetric core design.
In 2019, Yang's group successfully developed an asymmetric A–D–A type FREA based on the 2-(1-methyl-6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophen-4-ylidene)malononitrile (CPTCN-M) end group, namely, α-BTTIC (Fig. 2a).61 Compared to its symmetrical counterpart (BTTIC, Fig. 2a), the asymmetric α-BTTIC was designed by expanding the thiophene ring at one side to thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) unit, leading to a red-shifted absorption over 20 nm and an elevated lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level by 0.07 eV. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2b, the PBDB-T:α-BTTIC blend film showed better phase separation compared to the PBDB-T:BTTIC blend film, leading to faster exciton dissociation at the former interface. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2c and d, the d-spacing and the coherence length (CL) of the (010) diffraction peaks were calculated as 3.18/21.5 Å and 3.31/18.1 Å for the PBDB-T:α-BTTIC and PBDB-T:BTTIC blends, respectively, suggesting a more compact and stronger π–π stacking for the former blend, which is beneficial for balancing charge transport and reducing bimolecular recombinations. As a result, α-BTTIC-based OSCs with an optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.43 eV achieved a low Eloss of 0.526 eV and a high PCE of 13.60%, both of which are superior to those of BTTIC with an Eoptg of 1.47 eV (Eloss of 0.575 eV and PCE of 12.86%).

Recently, more and more efforts have been devoted to designing new A–DA′D–A type Y-series acceptors with an asymmetric core. Jen et al. have carefully explored the relationship between the conformation of Y-series acceptors and the optoelectronic properties through the asymmetric π-extension design of BP4T-4F, as shown in Fig. 3a.62 Density functional theory calculations showed that asymmetric BP5T-4F exhibited a unique Z-shape conformation in contrast to the traditional C-shape conformation of BP4T-4F and the W-shape conformation of ABP4T-4F. Nanofiber-like interpenetrating networks appeared in all three blend films, offering efficient charge transport channels. However, the root-mean-square (RMS) values of the BP5T-4F (1.41 nm) and ABP4T-4F (1.59 nm) blend films are almost twice as large as that of the BP4T-4F one (0.81 nm), which may cause unfavorable contact between the active layer and the electrode, hindering effective electron collection. This thus leads to a slight decrease in the FF of BP5T-4F and ABP4F-4F-based OSCs as shown in Table 1. Based on the equation Eloss = Eoptg − qVOC, Z-shaped BP5T-4F produced a smaller Eloss (0.450 eV) and a larger VOC (0.888 V) compared to those from C-shaped BP4T-4F (Eloss = 0.490 eV and VOC = 0.839 V), while W-shaped ABP4T-4F even achieved a much lower Eloss (0.440 eV) with a higher VOC (0.922 V). Moreover, from the intersection of EL and absorption spectra (Fig. 4a), the CT bandgaps of blends were accurately calculated as 1.389, 1.418, and 1.454 eV for BP4T-4F, BP5T-4F and ABP4T-4F blends, respectively, corresponding to the Eloss of 0.550, 0.530 and 0.531 eV. More encouragingly, in order to further investigate which part of Eloss was suppressed, photocurrent spectroscopy external quantum efficiency (FTPS-EQE) and EL measurements were conducted, with the results shown in Fig. 4b. The ΔE3 part of three OSCs showed a stepwise decline with the change of conformation (about 0.04 eV), from BP4T-4F (0.288 eV) to BP5T-4F (0.242 eV), and to ABP4T-4F (0.206 eV), suggesting that the NRR loss can be effectively reduced by an asymmetric core design.

Besides changing the conjugation length and/or the shape of the fused-ring core, replacing one of thiophene rings in the core by other heterocycles can also result in efficient asymmetric modification. In particular, the introduction of N-containing pyrrole and Se-containing selenophene units has shown much greater potential in suppressing the Eloss. Recently, Zhu's group has designed and synthesized a new asymmetric FREA called SN (Fig. 3b) by replacing one of the TT units of the Y6 core with 4-methyl-4H-thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole, which showed a higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (−5.51 eV) than that of Y6 (−5.70 eV).63 As a result, a negligible HOMO offset was realized when blended with the PM6 donor, making the Eloss derived from the singlet excited state of SN and its CT state reduced effectively to improve the VOC. Moreover, this symmetry breaking design endowed SN with a much higher dipole moment than Y6 (1.75 vs. 0.86 Debye), inducing tighter π–π stacking of SN in the film state. Therefore, a larger photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was obtained for SN relative to that of Y6, as shown in Fig. 4c, which is conducive to reducing ΔE3. Finally, the SN:PM6 based OCSs achieved a PCE of 14.3% with a low Eloss of 0.53 eV and an extremely low ΔE3 of 0.15 eV. This is the highest PCE among OSCs whose ΔE3 are lower than those of c-Si cells (0.18 eV).
Furthermore, Yang's group synthesized two new asymmetric acceptors, namely BTSe-4F and BTN-4F (Fig. 3c), by using a pyrrole or selenophene ring to replace one TT unit of the Y6 core.64 Compared with selenophene-fused BTSe-4F, pyrrole-fused BTN-4F exhibited a red-shifted absorption band (∼40 nm in the film) and slightly upshifted energy levels due to the enhanced electron-donating ability of pyrrole. When blended with a PM6 donor, both BTN-4F and BTSe-4F based blends were found to exhibit a uniform and smooth surface, with almost the same RMS roughness of 1.18 and 1.24 nm, respectively. However, the resulting BTN-4F-based OCSs showed a much lower Eloss of 0.514 eV than that of the BTSe-4F-based device (0.579 eV). These results therefore strongly confirm the effectiveness of the asymmetric core design in reducing the Eloss, in particular the NRR-related ΔE3, and integrating different types of heterocycles in the core could be an effective symmetry breaking design strategy.
2.2. Asymmetric terminal group design
Frankly, the synthesis of an asymmetric core is relatively tedious and complicated. In sharp contrast, modifying the terminal groups should be a more simple and direct strategy, which can subtly tune energy levels, absorption, and electron transporting properties of acceptors by simply combining two different terminals.65 As shown in Fig. 5a, the terminal groups can be divided into one type that could provide high VOC while another one that could provide high JSC. Currently, combining a terminal group with high JSC potential and a terminal group with high VOC potential has been successfully explored for reducing the Eloss, leading to high PCEs.52 Such structure design can result in two merits: (1) narrowing the energy level offset between the acceptor and donor to minimize the driving force for charge generation, while maintaining sufficient charge separation;66 (2) enhancing the EQEEL of the BHJ blend by improving the luminescence properties of acceptors.67

At present, halogenation of terminal groups is the most extensive and effective strategy to improve the device performance of FREAs, which has multiple effects such as enhancing the intermolecular interactions, changing the molecular polarization, increasing the electrostatic potential, adjusting the energy levels, etc.11,68–70 In addition, it has also been reported that the halogenation of FREAs has a positive effect on reducing the Eloss of OSCs. For example, Chen's group synthesized two asymmetric NFAs of BTP-S1 and BTP-S2 (Fig. 5b) using 4,5,6,7-tetrachloroindane-1,3-dione (I-4Cl) as one of terminal groups and 5,6-difluoro-3-(dicyanomethylene)indanone (IC-2F) and 5,6-dichloro-3-(dicyanomethylene)indanone (IC-2Cl) as another terminal group, respectively.67 Compared with Y6 with symmetrical terminal groups (IC-2F), the absorption of both BTP-S1 and BTP-S2 showed a blue shift of ∼50 nm due to the use of weak acceptor of I-4Cl, while the LUMO energy levels were upshifted by ∼0.09 eV. All three blends showed nanofiber-like morphology by AFM analysis, indicating the formation of the desired interpenetrating networks. In addition, the PM6:BTP-S2 blend exhibited a moderate domain size compared to those of PM6:BTP-S1 and PM6:Y6 blends, which can well balance the bimolecular and monomolecular recombination. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, the PM6:Y6-based OSCs had an EQEEL of 4.4 × 10−3%, a ΔE3 of 0.26 eV, and an Eloss of 0.58 eV; the PM6:BTP-S1-based OSCs possessed an EQEEL of 1.1 × 10−2%, a ΔE3 of 0.24 eV, and an Eloss of 0.56 eV; while the PM6:BTP-S2-based OSCs showed the highest EQEEL of 2.3 × 10−2%, a ΔE3 of 0.22 eV, and an Eloss of 0.53 eV. As a result, the VOCs of resulting OSCs (Fig. 6c) can be significantly improved from 0.842 V for Y6 to 0.934 V for BTP-S1, and to 0.945 V for BTP-S2. These results suggest that the introduction of more halogen atoms into terminal groups can reduce the NRR loss significantly, and chlorine substitution will perform better than its fluorine counterpart. BTP-S2-based OSCs finally achieved a champion PCE of 16.37%, obviously higher than that of BTP-S1-based devices (15.21%) and Y6-based devices (15.79%). Moreover, a much enhanced PCE of 17.43% was further realized based on a ternary BHJ blend of PM6:Y6:BTP-S2. More recently, over 18% PCE has been excitingly achieved by BTP-S2-based ternary OSCs via layer-by-layer solution processing.71

Previous reports have demonstrated that using chlorinated thiophene-fused derivative (CPTCN-Cl) as the terminal group rather than IC-2F can endow the resulting symmetric FREAs such as BTP-2ThCl (Fig. 5c) with higher VOC.72,73 Unfortunately, the resulting BTP-2ThCl-based OSCs showed lower JSC and PCE compared to those from Y6-based devices, attributed to insufficient charge separation.73 To minimize the HOMO level offset when achieving efficient charge separation, in 2020 Yan's group took advantage of asymmetric terminal group design, and developed a new asymmetric FREA named BTP-2F-ThCl (Fig. 5b) using IC-2F and CPTCN-Cl as the terminal groups.66 Encouragingly, with PM6 as the donor, the BTP-2F-ThCl-based device achieved a higher PCE of 17.06% compared to both of BTP-2ThCl and Y6 acceptors, due to the more balanced of VOC and JSC, as shown in Fig. 6d. It is worth mentioning that the Eloss of BTP-2F-ThCl-based OSCs is 0.025 eV lower than that of the BTP-2ThCl-based device (0.530 vs. 0.555 eV), benefiting from the reduced ΔE3 (0.22 eV vs. 0.25 eV). In 2022, Chen's group again used this asymmetric strategy to synthesize another new acceptor (AC9, Fig. 5b) with IC-2Cl and CPTCN-Cl as the terminal groups.52 Compared with its symmetric counterparts (BTP-eC9 and C9-2TC, Fig. 5c), AC9 could promote VOC effectively while guaranteeing high JSC and FF, resulting in a much higher PCE, up to 18.43% (18.10% certified), as presented in Fig. 6e, which is one of the best PCE among binary OSCs. AC9 exhibited a low bandgap but the highest EQEEL (Fig. 6f) due to the asymmetric terminal group design, which can compromise charge generation and recombination and thus endow the resulting OSCs with a low ΔE3 of 0.238 eV and a relatively low Eloss of 0.539 eV while possessing a high JSC of 26.75 mA cm−2.
Furthermore, Chen and Min et al. developed a new kind of terminal group, TPC-Cl, in which the π-conjugation of 3-(dicyanomethylene)indanone (IC) is extended through fusing an additional chlorinated thiophene ring, based on which an asymmetric FREA (BTP-T-3Cl, Fig. 5b) and its symmetric counterpart (BTP-T-2Cl, Fig. 5c) were prepared.74 As shown in Fig. 6g, both acceptors had slightly lower-lying HOMO levels than PM6 compared to IC-2Cl-based symmetric BTP-4Cl-BO (Fig. 5c), resulting in a decreased HOMO offset. Excitingly, the PM6:BTP-T-2Cl device showed a good EQEEL of 0.0606%, which is one order of magnitude higher than that of the PM6:BTP-4Cl-BO device, leading to a much lower ΔE3 of 0.191 eV and thus a small Eloss of 0.49 V. These results suggest that expanding the π-conjugation of the terminal group on FREAs with an electron-rich ring is an effective strategy to reduce NRR in OSCs. However, the PCE of the PM6:BTP-T-2Cl device was only 14.89%, caused by insufficient charge generation. In sharp contrast, asymmetric BTP-T-3Cl can produce the best PCE among three FREAs, up to 17.61%, due to the simultaneous enhancement of VOC and JSC, and the corresponding Eloss is as low as 0.51 eV, as shown in Fig. 6h and i. Moreover, the device PCE of a ternary blend based on PM6:BTP-4Cl-BO:BTP-T-3Cl can be further improved to be 18.21% with a small Eloss of 0.54 eV.
2.3. Asymmetric side chain design
As discussed previously, suitable nanoscale phase separation morphology plays a critical role in charge separation and transport.75,76 Among various strategies, side-chain engineering has been widely recognized as a powerful tool to adjust the phase morphology of the active layer.77 In this manner, the asymmetric side chain design strategy has also been explored to reduce the Eloss by tuning the molecular packing and regulating the film morphology. In 2020, Jen's group synthesized an asymmetric FREA, namely TOBDT (Fig. 7a), based on the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) fused central core substituted with two different alkoxy and thienyl side chains.78 The fabricated PM6:TOBDT-based OSCs achieved a high PCE of 11.3% with a VOC of 0.89 V, and a low Eloss of 0.590 eV for A–D–A type FREAs. Furthermore, when introducing a symmetric acceptor (IDIC) as the third component, the resulting ternary device based on PM6:TOBDT:IDIC (1:0.7:0.3) blend delivered a much enhanced PCE of 14% with a decreased Eloss of 0.572 eV, attributed to the reduction of ΔE3 resulting from larger EQEEL.
 Fig. 7  The chemical structures of FREAs with asymmetric side chains and π-bridges (a) and their counterparts (b). 
As discussed above, one of the major reasons for the high exciton binding energy of OSCs should be ascribed to the relatively lower dielectric constant of organic semiconductors (εr ≈ 3–4) relative to those of inorganic/hybrid semiconductors (Si ≈ 12, GaAs ≈ 12 and perovskite ≈ 18).77 Modification of side chains has been proved as an effective approach to enhance εr of organic solids. In 2021, as shown in Fig. 8a, Lin's group synthesized a high dielectric constant acceptor Y6-4O (Fig. 7a) with a εr of 4.77 ± 0.27 by introducing an asymmetric oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) side chain into one of the pyrrole units of Y6 (εr = 3.30 ± 0.05).79 Moreover, Y6-4O also exhibited a much higher dipolar moment than Y6 (2.60 vs. 0.70 Debye), which can improve the intermolecular interactions to strengthen the J-type aggregation and thus to improve the PL efficiency. As a result, enhanced exciton dissociation and decreased charge recombination were realized for Y6-4O-based OSCs, evidenced by transient absorption results (Fig. 8b), leading to a lower Eloss of 0.57 eV than that of Y6-based control devices (0.59 eV). What's more, due to the improved solubility and film-forming ability in nonhalogenated solvents as a result of this asymmetric side chain design, the resulting PM6:Y6-4O-based OSCs processed using toluene delivered an impressive PCE of 15.2% (Fig. 8c), which is significantly higher than that of control Y6-based devices (7.38%) under the same conditions.

At present, non-fused NFAs have also attracted more and more interest due to their reduced synthetic complexity and more flexibility in the molecular design.80,81 Recently, Bo's group integrated the asymmetric side chain design into developing high performance non-fused NFAs, and a new asymmetric NFA, namely FO-N (Fig. 7a), synthesized by inserting one branched lateral chain and one fluoro-substituent into the core.82 Compared to the control acceptor (DO-2F, Fig. 7b) showing a PCE of 10.62% with a VOC of 0.83 V, the asymmetric FO-N achieved a much higher PCE of 11.38% with an enhanced VOC of 0.92 V, as shown in Table 1, mainly due to the upshifted LUMO level of FO-N and its more favorable nanoscale BHJ film morphology when blended with PBDB-T (Fig. 8d). Nonetheless, the Eloss PBDB-T:FO-N blend was determined to be slightly higher than that of the PBDB-T:DO-2F blend (0.56 vs. 0.54 eV), which could be attributed to its larger CT bandgap (1.42 vs. 1.34 eV). However, the PCE of the ternary device based on PBDB-T:FO-N:DO-2F (1:0.6:0.4) blend was significantly improved to 14.10% with a more decreased Eloss of 0.51 eV, mainly ascribed to the optimized blend morphology with more appropriate phase separation and crystallinity (Fig. 8d) in the ternary BHJ. The preferred BHJ morphology can improve the charge separation to efficiently reduce the ΔE3.
2.4. Asymmetric π-bridge design
At present, the asymmetric π-bridge design has been less explored to reduce the Eloss of OSCs. One recent example is that Bao's group synthesized a new A–D–π–A type asymmetric acceptor ID-C6Ph-ST-4F (Fig. 7a) by inserting an alkythio-substituted thiophene bridge into one side of symmetric ID-C6Ph-4F with phenylhexyl side chains (Fig. 7b).83 Due to this asymmetric π-bridge design, the dipole moment of ID-C6Ph-ST-4F can be significantly improved from 0.46 Debye of ID-C6Ph-4F to 2.44 Debye, and thus ID-C6Ph-ST-4F exhibited enhanced crystallinity and better intermolecular interactions in the film state. As displayed in Fig. 8e, the fabricated PM6:ID-C6Ph-ST-4F blend showed a well-distributed fibrous BHJ film morphology with favorable face-on packing orientation, while the PM6:ID-C6Ph-4F blend exhibited an aggregated BHJ film morphology with lots of crystallites. Therefore, the PM6:ID-C6Ph-ST-4F blend showed a significantly improved PCE, of up to 15.36%, which is much higher than that of the PM6:ID-C6Ph-4F blend (10.75%). Moreover, the OSCs based on ID-C6Ph-ST-4F exhibited a substantially reduced Eloss of only 0.57 eV compared to that of the ID-C6Ph-4F-based device (0.74 eV), attributed to stronger D/A interactions in the former BHJ.
3. Summary and outlook
As presented, symmetry breaking has been proven to be an effective structure design of NFAs for reducing the Eloss of OSCs while maintaining a high JSC, due to their potential of reducing the exciton binding energy and suppressing the NRR loss simultaneously. Thanks to the innovative design of A–DA′D–A-type FREAs, the best PCE of asymmetric acceptors has excitingly exceeded 18% based on the binary BHJ OSCs with a low Eloss of ∼0.54 eV and a high JSC of 26.75 mA cm−2.52 Different design strategies have been successfully explored to modify the structural symmetry of FREAs to date, including the asymmetric conjugated core design, asymmetric terminal group design, asymmetric side chain design and asymmetric π-bridge design. Nevertheless, more efforts should be made to develop novel symmetry breaking strategies to promote the development of asymmetric FREAs and further improve the device performance. Meanwhile, it is necessary to explore new synthetic methods to reduce the material costs of asymmetric FREAs. Potential future directions in this field are proposed as follows.
(1) Learning from the reason behind the amazing performance of Y6-type acceptors, we can conclude that the intermolecular packing mode of acceptor molecules plays a significant role in boosting the device performance, which is highly related to the molecular shape of acceptors. For asymmetric core modification, one attractive advantage is its ability to effectively alter the shape of the acceptor. Based on the current results,62 researchers could focus on the W-shape or Z-shape design to further reduce the Eloss of FREAs through core asymmetry modification. Compared to the heteroatom substitution strategy, changing the conjugation length of the asymmetric core has a more pronounced impact on the molecular shape, which can simultaneously affect the BHJ film morphology, Eloss and device performance. Nonetheless, the relationship between the shape of FREAs, the intermolecular packing mode, and the performance of OSCs is still unclear, which needs more deep studies in the future.
(2) The asymmetric terminal group modification is a simple and efficient way to balance the VOC and JSC. It has been shown that terminal groups with luminescence potential can provide high VOC and low Eloss by increasing the EQEEL.52,65–67,74 Therefore, it is necessary to develop more new types of terminal groups with high luminescence performance in the future. In addition, more general rules of organically matching different terminal groups need to be explored. Currently, in most cases a high JSC terminal group is used to match a high VOC terminal group. We believe exploring the new asymmetric terminal group strategy is a shortcut to further enhance the PCE of OSCs without changing the structure and performance of the main body.
(3) The side chain asymmetry strategy has shown obvious effects in reducing the Eloss, and introducing one polar side chain can significantly increase the εr of acceptors while maintaining high solubility and film processing ability. Moreover, asymmetric π-bridge modification can increase the conjugation length of molecules while increasing the dipolar moment. Integrating these two strategies with core or terminal group symmetry modification could enable synergetic effects, which however has not been explored so far and needs more attention.
(4) As a class of early NFAs,84 rylene imides such as naphthalenediimide (NDI)85 and perylenediimide (PDI)86,87 have been widely studied; however the symmetry-breaking strategy has been rarely applied for the design of these materials, possibly due to the synthetic challenges.88 However, it is worth noting that asymmetric design of PDI-based acceptors has been shown to reduce their aggregation and crystallization tendency by destroying the co-planarity, which can enable favorable film morphology and π–π stacking to boost the PCEs.89,90 As a result, more efforts will be needed to develop suitable symmetry-breaking strategies as well as feasible synthetic methods for imide-based NFAs.
(5) Recently, machine learning has attracted more and more attention from researchers in the field of OSCs.91,92 Since a large number of new FREAs are being reported now, the relationship between their structure and performance is becoming increasingly clear. Thus, based on the existing results of symmetric FREAs, asymmetric structure optimization can be accelerated through machine learning, and diverse asymmetric structures will be explored more efficiently.
(6) Now, one of the limitations for asymmetric FREAs should be their relatively complicated synthesis compared to their symmetric counterparts, which requires more synthetic steps and always suffers from purification problems. To address this, one possible solution is to develop new and efficient synthetic methods. Alternatively, the development of non-fused asymmetric acceptors could be another feasible solution, since non-fused core exhibits low material cost, and has more flexibilities in designing asymmetric structures through combining different functional groups via a step-by-step synthesis.
Overall, the symmetry breaking strategy has been increasingly applied in the molecular design of new NFAs for OSCs, and the device performance of asymmetric NFAs has achieved fast progress in recent years, attributed to its great potential of reducing the Eloss. Note that high performance symmetric acceptors often become much better through subtle asymmetric modification. What's more, another promising role that asymmetric acceptors can play is as the third component of ternary BHJ, which can simultaneously improve the device PCE and stability of OSCs by strengthening the D/A interactions and inducing a favorable BHJ film morphology.
