    , Accepted 12th August 2021First published on 12th August 2021AbstractWorld-wide increased energy consumption and demand has made the need for high-energy storage systems with longer life critical. Hence, extensive research and development on supercapacitors based on efficient and robust electrode materials are being carried out. Many materials based on metal oxides, polymers, carbon-based materials, metal chalcogenides, and their composites have been explored to reach saturation to obtain the milestone capacitance value and hence, energy density. Recently, metal phosphides (MPs) have arisen as a unique class of potential candidates for high performance supercapacitors owing to their inherent semi-metallic nature and high electrical conductivity. Aid of fascinating properties, MPs has driven to reach demarcation outlined by champion metal oxides based electrodes for supercapacitor applications. We systematically reviewed the phosphides family including the phosphides of nickel, cobalt, iron, and copper to give a clear understanding in terms of their versatile applications in supercapacitors. Aside from mono-metal phosphides, an extensive analysis of the literature about multi-metal phosphides with combined benefits from two or more metal species has been explored. To further exploit their interesting properties, MPs have been integrated with other functionally active materials to form binary composites or even ternary composites. The present review article concentrates on modern research findings in the synthetic routes of nanostructured MPs in correlation with the structures, morphologies, and their electrochemical energy storage performances. Subsequently, the importance of strong synergistic effects existing in MP-based nanocomposites is highlighted along with some representative works on the fabrication of symmetric/asymmetric supercapacitor devices. Finally, the current challenges and future opportunities in real energy technology device applications of MPs are proposed.Akanksha AgarwalAkanksha Agarwal is currently a PhD student in the Department of Physics, Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT), Nagpur (India) under DST-Inspire scheme, Government of India.

1. Introduction
The present time in the global market certainly calls for advanced energy technologies that can provide more green and sustainable solutions to prevent the adverse effects imposed by the scarcity of fossil fuels and their resources. In this direction, to suppress the fossil fuel infrastructure, the utilization of clean and alternative sources of energy such as biomass, wind, solar, and tidal turns is a coherent way for creating a feasible energy future. Nevertheless, due to intermittency of these renewable energy sources, efficient electrical energy storage systems are necessary to deliver stable, consistent electricity for commercial and household end-use purpose.1–3 In addition, in light of the development of hybrid electric vehicles and modern portable electronic devices, energy storage systems are critical in terms of their performance, efficiency, and reliability, which can be tuned by adopting appropriate storage technologies.4 To date, a wide array of technological approaches is being deployed by energy storage systems including electrochemical, thermal, mechanical, and hydrothermal.5,6 Among these, especially in modern usage, electrochemical energy storage systems such as batteries,7–9 supercapacitors,10–13 and fuel cells14,15 are the most promising candidates for enabling energy sustainability, pollution check/management, and greenhouse gas mitigation. In response to existing and emerging energy requirements, these systems continue to evolve, adapt, and innovate in terms of cost, life, time, and performance. On the one hand, rechargeable batteries/fuel cells involving redox reactions inside the bulk of electrode material present remarkable energy density because of high charge storage capacities but suffer through low power density due to phase changes while dielectric capacitors rely on quick charge separation and recombination, offering limited energy density but good power performance output.16,17 Contrarily, supercapacitors store charge either through surface adsorption or reversible redox reactions at an electrode/electrolyte interface accompanying any phase transformation, and thus, play a key link between batteries/fuel cells and conventional capacitors.18,19 To give a brief comparative overview of widespread electrochemical devices used for energy storage with respect to performance characteristics, the Ragone plot is provided in Fig. 1. The advantages of supercapacitors over conventional energy storage systems include ultra-high power capability, long cycle life, fast charge–discharge characteristics, robust thermal operating domain, and safe operation, altogether making them a novel class of energy storage systems that hold enormous potential to meet the high-power demands of modern society. Due to these remarkable merits, their widespread applications have been explored in many portable electronic devices and hybrid electric automobiles.20,21

The performance efficiency of any supercapacitor system is popularly assessed with regard to specific capacitance, energy density, and power density along with cycle life, self-discharging current, and retention capacity.22 The specific capacitance (Cs,elec) of an electrode is determined from cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) analysis, as per eqn (1) and (2), respectively. (1) (2)where, ‘melec’ represents the mass of active material, ‘V1’ and ‘V2’ are the potential limits of voltage scan, ‘ν’ is the scan rate, the integration ‘’ in eqn (1) indicates the area enclosed under the CV curve over an operational voltage window, the terms ‘I’, the integral ‘’, ‘td’, and ‘tc’ indicate steady discharge current applied for GCD measurement, area under the discharge curve, and discharging and charging time, respectively. The specific capacitance is usually expressed in units of F g−1 as gravimetric capacitance. However, in the cases where surface and volumetric charge storage considerations are important, other units such as areal (F cm−2) and volumetric (F cm−3) capacitances are preferred.23
The specific capacitance (Cs,cell) value for a two-electrode supercapacitor cell assembly from GCD analysis is given by (3)here, M = sum of masses of active material on both the electrodes, i.e., M = manode + mcathode (for symmetric device, manode = mcathode).24
Subsequently, energy density, power density, and coulombic efficiency (retention capacity) are calculated with the help of the following equations. (4) (5) (6)
Thus, high performance supercapacitors can be mainly attributed to the lower value of equivalent series resistance (ESR), widened operating voltage, and high capacitance value, which are determined by the characteristics of the electrode material employed and electrolyte ions' interaction.25–27 Enormous efforts have been made to develop supercapacitors capable of storing a considerable amount of energy with extremely low power loss.28,29 Henceforth, new superior electrode materials that are abundant, non-toxic, as well as possess high conductivity, large specific surface area, high porosity, and relatively low cost need to be investigated. Based on their charge storage fundamentals, electrode materials can be broadly classified into two types, namely, capacitor-like and battery-type. Generally, electric double layer capacitors (EDLC) and pseudocapacitors are recognized as capacitor-like materials. The former category includes high specific surface area and conductive materials, such as carbon-based materials where energy is stored through non-faradaic charge accumulation, while the latter stores energy through fast faradaic redox reactions localized near the electrode surface such as transition metal oxides and conductive polymers.30,31 Typically, activated carbon (AC), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and graphene are considered as potent EDLC materials by virtue of the high electrical conductivity, extensive surface area, and substantial stability but suffer from low energy density as a result of the electrostatic surface charging mechanism.32–35 Carbon materials store charge in an electric double layer rather than undergoing faradaic reactions deep inside the bulk, which is the primary reason behind the relatively low energy density of carbonaceous materials as compared to other types of supercapacitor electrodes.36–38 Also, there are several other key factors that dictate the performance efficiency of carbon materials for supercapacitor electrodes such as pore size distribution, pore shape and structure, and surface functionalities. It is worth mentioning that a high specific surface area not always implies high specific capacitance due to the fact that not all micropores in the electrode structure are indispensably accessible to the electrolyte. Surface area inaccessibility due to the mismatch of the pore size with the ion size impedes the capacitance value of carbon materials, resulting in limited energy density values.27 In addition, the contact resistance between the particles in the carbon framework creates long ion diffusion pathways, leading to increased internal series resistance, consequently lowering the energy density of carbon-based electrodes.39 On the other hand, conducting polymers such as polypyrrrole (PPy), polyaniline (PANI), polythiophene, and their derivatives are extensively studied as pseudocapacitive materials and are highly beneficial to attain high energy density due to the conjugated structure of the polymers.40 It is noteworthy that the swelling and shrinkage of conducting polymers during the charge discharge process results in mechanical degradation and poor cyclability.41 Owing to the high theoretical capacitance values, metal oxides/hydroxides are another important descendants of pseudocapacitive materials are metal oxides/hydroxides.42–45 It is interesting to mention that besides the surface redox reactions, some transition metal oxides such as MoO3, V2O5, and Nb2O5 exhibit intercalation pseudocapacitance owing to their tunable layer structure for ion intercalation/deintercalation with no change in their phases.46 The oxides/hydroxides of metal exhibit low electrical conductivity and poor mechanical integrity because of the degradation of the structure under high current charging or discharging.47,48 This compels the research community to invest additional efforts in order to develop more reliable alternative electrode materials for enhanced performance of the supercapacitors. In contrast to capacitor-like materials, battery-type materials possess high charge storing abilities as they involve diffusion-limited faradaic redox processes accompanying phase transformations during the charging/discharging processes. Ni, Co, Cu-based oxides/hydroxides, sulfides, selenides, and phosphides are typical examples of battery-type materials.49–51 Although sulfides/selenides exhibit good electrochemical activity, they often suffer from dissolution in alkaline electrolyte media, resulting in poor chemical stability.52–54 Different types of charge storage mechanisms, classic electrode materials, and their CV profiles are outlined in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Schematic illustration of the charge storage mechanism of different types of supercapacitors, typical electrode materials, and corresponding CV profiles. 
Using the power law dependence of peak current on the voltage scan rate as per the equation i = aνb(7)where, ‘a’ and ‘b’ are adjustable parameters, the type of the electrode material in terms of the capacitor and battery can be simply identified. Specifically, the b value of 1 corresponds to the purely capacitive system, while b is 0.5 for typical battery-type materials. Also, the b value lying between 0.5 and 1 represents the cumulation of both capacitive and diffusion limited kinetics involving phase change during charge/discharge.55 The relative contribution of capacitive (k1ν) and battery-type behavior can be quantified by probing the current (i) with scan rate (ν) for a specific potential, as given below.56 i(V) = k1ν + k2ν1/2(8) (9)
In consideration to metal phosphides (MPs), the charge storage fundamentals are believed to be dominantly originating from the reversible faradaic reactions occurring with phase transformations due to electrochemical oxidation during charge/discharge.57,58 Thus, as derived from their battery-type behavior, the most general reaction mechanism of MPs in an alkaline medium could possibly be expressed using following equations. MxPy + xOH− → MxPyOHx + xe−(10) MxPyOHx + xOH− → MxPyOx + xH2O + xe−(11)
The former expression is related to the oxidation of MPs, whereas the latter can be ascribed to the transformation process occurring on reaction with OH− ions.59 The adsorption energy of OH− ions can be used to determine the kinetics of redox reactions, which in turn will influence the ion transport capability between the active material and the electrolyte.60
Carbon materials are capable of delivering energy at a faster rate with good cyclic stability than those of pseudo-based materials; nevertheless, several MPs possess much better electrical conductivity with regard to rapid charge-transfer kinetics, effortless electron transfer, and inherently superior activity, which are advantageous in electrochemical supercapacitors.61,62 Similar to carbon-based materials, MPs provide flexibility in terms of the tuning of nano- and meso-structures for better access for the electrolyte ions, which is desirable for competitive electrodes where both adequate intra-as well as inter-particle conductivities are needed.63,64 Apart from this, they are also mechanically hard and strong, which may definitely make them effective and low-cost electrode materials for supercapacitor devices practically in the field of energy storage.65,66 In addition, they are electrochemically more stable in comparison to conducting polymers, thus also almost nullifying the limitation of material degradation and poor cyclic stability.67–69 A schematic illustrating the unique properties and applications of MPs is shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Schematic of the unique properties and emerging electrochemical applications of MP-based materials. 
Phosphorus is a multivalent non-metallic element of the pnictogen family in the periodic table, which is one of the most useful donor atoms in coordination chemistry.70 Elemental phosphorus has several allotropes namely; white phosphorus and red phosphorus that exhibit strikingly diverse properties.71,72 As phosphorus is highly reactive, it can create a series of phosphorus compounds including phosphates and phosphides, which have been recently studied for energy storage applications.73–75 The combination of metals and elemental phosphorus gives a series of MPs exhibiting better metalloid properties from those of metal carbide and nitride counterparts due to the less electronegativity of phosphorus with reduced bond ionicity.76 Moreover, the unique feature of coexisting direct metal–metal and P–P bonding networks in MPs show high flexibility in the cation/anion ratio (variable valence states and coordination numbers), which offers open framework with large channels and cavities for efficient electron/ion transport.77 Carbon and nitrogen possess atomic radii of 0.71 and 0.65 Å, whereas phosphorus shows a comparatively larger value (1.09 Å), leading to variable stoichiometric states and hence, the various compositions, which is responsible for enhanced storage capability and various crystal structures of MPs.78,79 Also, MPs exhibit outstanding excellent physicochemical characteristics and demonstrate better chemical stability with good corrosion resistance. Since the electrons in P-rich compounds are mainly confined in the vicinity of P atoms, this results in the reduction of their electrical and ionic characteristic; thus, they are not ideal for energy storage.80 Thereupon, phosphides rich in metals (for e.g., M3P, M2P, and MP) can facilitate more electrical conduction due to their metallic character. Moreover, in metal-rich phosphides, crystalline structures are based on P atom-centered triangular prism type geometry, where metal atoms are positioned at the corners as well as near the centers of the vertical phases of the prism, which is particularly identified as a 9-fold tetrakaidecahedral structure. Fig. 4 portrays distinct crystal structures of several MPs obtained due to different arrangements of these building blocks. These unique crystalline geometries are believed to offer promisingly full outburst to the edge positions and active corners on the crystallite surfaces.81

To date, countless articles have qualitatively presented extensive studies on metal oxides, polymers, carbon-based materials, and metal chalcogenides as well as their composites toward supercapacitor applications; nonetheless, to reach the saturation so as to obtain the milestone capacitance value and hence, the energy density.36,43,82 Recently, considerable attention is being paid to MPs, which have been found to be emerging candidates for robust and efficient electrode materials due to their inherent semi-metallic nature and high electrical conductivity.66,76,83,84 Benefitting from these scientific merits and theoretically predicted fulfilment, an extensive work has been reported to advance and perceive them in-depth. For instance, Wang et al. in 2015 overviewed nanostructured MP-based electrode materials in correlation with their electrochemical performance for Li/Na ion batteries along with corresponding charge storage characteristics.83 In the year 2017, Li et al. summed up the studies on transition metal phosphates and phosphides as the electrode materials for supercapacitors.84 Dinh and his group in 2019 discussed the synthetic methods for carbides, nitrides, and phosphides of transition metals and their applications in energy storage and conversion technologies.76 Very recently, a discussion on MPs anode with a wide array of nanostructures in different dimensions for rechargeable batteries has been presented.66 Though ample research studies have showcased the prominence of MPs, no such direct report that comprehensively covers the fabrication processing techniques of MPs as well as electrochemical properties modulation in terms of their composition, structure, and electrode preparation parameters (mass loading, substrate choice, internal electric resistance, etc.) for supercapacitor applications has been published yet. In this regard, the present review exclusively emphasizes on the typical recent leading and frontier studies in the state-of-the-art of MPs' design for supercapacitors with a prime discussion on the impact of their nanoarchitecture, composition, and structural defects over their resultant electrochemical properties, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 5. Initially, a brief description of the basis characteristics of the MPs in terms of the charge storage mechanism and the crystal structures are presented, followed by an overview of different techniques and phosphorus precursors used for synthesis, including chemical methods with and without templates or binder additions. Subsequently, a comprehensive insight into the supercapacitor applications of various MP-based electrodes with the attention focused on the modulation of their inherent electrochemical properties upon chemical doping, structural development, composition tuning, or composite fabrication. In addition, some representative works on the assembly of symmetric/asymmetric devices are also highlighted. At the end, the current concerns and future research opportunities with respect to the commercial applications of MP electrodes for energy storage technologies are proposed.

2. Metal phosphides
Low-cost and abundant MPs are known as n-type semiconductors, possessing metalloid characteristics with intrinsic superior electrical conductivity, which is favorable for the rapid kinetics of electron transport.85,86 Hence, several MPs are considered as one of the competitive substitutes for conventional metal oxide/hydroxide-based electrodes.59,87Table 1 provides the list of MP-based electrodes that have been explored for supercapacitor applications, comprising their corresponding preparation techniques and morphologies along with the electrochemical parameters.

2.1. Synthetic methodologies
Diverse processing techniques for MPs emerging from different type of phosphorus sources have been explored. For simplicity and better understanding, we broadly classified the source of phosphorus into two categories, namely, organic and inorganic, in which each category is further divided into subcategories as per the methods employed. Generally, the methods that adopt inorganic sources such as elemental phosphorus, hypophosphite, phosphate, or alternative phosphorus sources (Na3P) are hydrothermal, solvothermal, ball milling, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). On the other hand, the process of thermal decomposition prefers organic phosphines such as trioctylphophine (TOP), its oxide (TOPO), aryl- and alkyl-phosphines, and triphenylphosphine as the phosphorus precursors to synthesize MPs. The above-mentioned methods and their relative advantages/disadvantages have been presented. Fig. 6 describes different inorganic and organic phosphorus sources used for the synthesis of MPs.
 Fig. 6  Overview of the various types of ‘P’ sources for the synthesis of MPs nanostructures. 

2.1.1. Organic phosphines. 
Numerous studies have adopted the thermal decomposition/pyrolysis of organic phosphines such as TOP, TOPO, tris(trimethylsilyl)-phosphine (TMSP), and (TPP) for the phosphidation of transition metal complexes such as metal acetylacetonates or carbonyls in organic solvents having high boiling point (for e.g., octyl ether, 1-octadecene, olelylamine (OAm), and squalene) under Ar or N2 protective environment at the temperature of 300 °C or above to synthesize MPs.88–91 This is considered to be the most generalized way of preparing phosphides of Ni,92–96 Co,97–99 Fe,100etc., along with their composites. For instance, single crystalline nanoplates of Ni12P5 was developed with (Ni(acac)2) as nickel source and TOP as the phosphorus source.95 Similarly, Ni2P nanoplates were grown directly on nickel foam (NF) using NF as the only nickel source.96 Through the proper optimization of the reaction parameters such as temperature, reaction duration, and precursor-to-solvent ratio, the desired product with controlled compositions, morphologies, and sizes is achievable. For example, both the flower-like and rod-like morphologies of Co2P were obtained with controlled Co(acac)3 decomposition in the presence of TPP and OAm.99 Apart from the mentioned organic P sources, phytic acid can also be used as an effective P source. In this regard, FeP-anchored nanoporous carbon (FeP/C) were prepared by the pyrolysis of iron nitrate–phytic acid mixed solution.101 However, the high temperature of decomposition, toxicity of organic phosphines, and the usage of organic solvents results in the reaction becoming flammable and corrosive, hindering their future uses.


2.1.2. Inorganic and elemental P sources. 
As discussed above, the drawbacks associated with organic phosphine routes urge researchers to employ inorganic phosphorus sources with the aid of simple and facile synthetic routes for MPs. These alternate approaches of inorganic precursors have been extensively adopted in several methods, as discussed below.
2.1.2.1. Phosphate reduction. 
Earlier, the most common method employed for the preparation of tungsten phosphides and molybdenum phosphides was by reducing metal orthophosphate via CH4 or H2 only at temperatures more than 650 °C.102 This method results in the formation of the bulk phase instead of the nanostructure, limiting its applicability in energy storage; thus, it is not preferred.
2.1.2.2. Hydrothermal/solvothermal. 
Apart from phosphate reduction, hydrothermal/solvothermal methods have emerged as an effective strategy to prepare different types of MPs. In these processes, elemental phosphorus sources such as red, white, or yellow phosphorus are treated with metal salts (acetate, chlorides, sulfate, nitrate, etc.) in a mixture of solvents, e.g., water and ethanol, whereas the obtained mixture is heated in an autoclave at relatively low temperatures (<200 °C). For example, the facile synthesis of Ni2P was performed using red P as phosphorus source and nickel chloride as the metal precursor through the one-pot hydrothermal method. The addition of glucose in the above reaction mixture of red P and NiCl2 under the same condition resulted in the formation of the Ni2P/C composite.103 In the case of the solvothermal process, the solvent used was N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).104 Moreover, to obtain controlled or tuned nanostructures/mesostructures, surfactants were added into the solution. Taking Co2P as an example, when the surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was added to the reaction solution of CoCl2 and yellow phosphorus, Co2P nanoshuttles were formed.105 Several reports are available on the use of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as 2D black phosphorus (BP) to synthesize MPs. For example, novel heterostructured Ni2P@BP nanosheets were engineered through the hydrothermal method using NiCl2 and BP, where the sonication-assisted exfoliated BP nanosheets were used as the P precursor.106
2.1.2.3. High energy ball milling. 
Ball milling as a facile and low-cost method was successfully adopted to develop MPs, in which a mixture of metal sources and NaH2PO2 or elemental P sources was subjected to high-energy collision. For example, Sn4P3 was obtained by the simple mechano-chemical reaction of Sn and red P under Ar atmosphere.107 AgP2 was synthesized from the reaction of Ag and red P powders for 3 h under an inert atmosphere. Using the same strategy, a novel nanocomposite of AgP2/C was developed from the ball-milling of synthesized AgP2 and carbon black powders.108 Similarly, V4P7 was prepared by alloying V and P powder using high energy mechanical milling.109 Some of the reports used ball milling method with subsequent post-annealing treatment under an inert atmosphere as the desired reaction could not be accomplished. For instance, the Co–P precursor was prepared by the mechanical alloying of Co and red P powder under Ar atmosphere for 8 h, followed by thermal annealing to obtain the pure phase of CoP.110
2.1.2.4. Pseudo-CVD method. 
PH3 is also another inorganic precursor that can be used for the preparation of MPs but due to its extreme toxic nature, hypophosphites are generally preferred for substitution. Sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2) can generate PH3 on-scene at a temperature of about 250 °C, as given below. 2NaH2PO2 → Na2HPO4 + PH3.(12)
The generated PH3 upstream on the reaction with the downstream precursors of transition metals (for e.g., oxides/hydroxides, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and even with metal sometimes) at 300–350 °C under the protective flow of the gas results in MPs and the entire process is known to be pseudo-chemical vapor deposition or pseudo-CVD. The very first merit of this process is that the pristine morphology of the precursors in the downstream remains almost unchanged after phosphorization. Secondly, it involves no surfactant and is relevant for the extensive domain of the metal precursors as compared to the organic phosphine path. For example, the FeP nanotube arrays on carbon cloth (CC) were prepared using a three-step process. Firstly, ZnO nanorod arrays were grown by the hydrothermal method and then sacrificed to form the Fe(OH)3 nanorods, which were converted to FeP by phosphidation.111 In addition, a novel T-Nb2O5@Ni2P core–shell porous heterostructure was constructed, when T-Nb2O5@Ni(OH)2 grown on NF and NaH2PO2 were placed separately and upstream of N2 flow in a furnace.112 In the same report, Ni2P nanoflakes were also synthesized just by replacing the precursor with Ni(OH)2 for comparison purposes. Unique hierarchical Ni2P nanoparticles self-inlaid carbon nanosheet framework (CNF) hybrids were successfully prepared through a low-temperature phosphorization process from the Ni–CNFs precursor.113 The phosphorization of the metal precursors by the on-site generated PH3 also provides an easy and facile approach to synthesize multi-metal phosphides due to the adaptability of the metal precursors. For example, Ni0.6Co1.4P nanocages were engineered through the solid-state phosphorization of the Ni0.6Co1.4(OH)2 nanocages with NaH2PO2 at 300 °C for 2 h.114
2.1.2.5. Electrochemical deposition. 
Besides the methods mentioned above, electrochemical deposition has been implemented as a direct-growth strategy to synthesize MPs. A precursor solution of the metal cation of interest or its complex undergoes electrolysis to deposit a uniform and adherent coating of the desired MPs onto the surface of the conducting substrate. For example, hierarchical radial NixP nanospheres were decorated onto NF in a three-electrode system with NF as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and Pt foil as the counter electrode. The electrolyte used consisted of NaH2PO2 as the phosphorus source and Ni ions.115 Similarly, the porous film of CoP was electrodeposited onto three-dimensional (3D) CC, where CC was used as a current collector.116
Also, numerous works on the synthesis of MPs using the solid-state reaction have been reported. This method involves the solid-state reaction, i.e., metal precursor and the phosphorus source at much higher temperatures through the mechanism of controlled diffusion, and hence, longer reaction time is required. For instance, bimetallic phosphides (NiCoP) were prepared by the one-step solid-state reaction of the mixture of NaH2PO2, Ni, and Co precursor under Ar atmosphere.117

2.2. Metal phosphide-based supercapacitors
Highly abundant and environment-friendly MPs possess high theoretical energy storage capacity owing to their extraordinary electrical conductivity combined with superior redox activity. With an impressive pseudo-capacitive behavior, various MPs have been progressively explored toward electrochemical capacitors. A schematic representation of the strategies employed for enhancing the capacitance of MP-based electrodes from structure modulation to composite structure construction is shown in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  Summary of the strategies employed for enhancing the capacitance of MP-based electrodes from structure modulation to composite structure construction. 

2.2.1. Nickel phosphides. 
Among the reported MPs, Ni-based phosphides and their composites are considered among the leading electrode materials in the energy storage field because of their extraordinary redox properties together with superior electrical conductivity. In comparison to their oxide counterparts, where both Ni and O atoms are solely connected through covalent bonding with no free electrons due to the higher electronegativity of O, phosphides contain P atom, which is less electronegative than the O atom, both the metallic and covalent bonds come into existence in the phosphides to provide free electrons for better ionic transport in the charge-transfer reaction.118 For example, the slopes of the current–voltage (I–V) curves for Ni2P and Ni7P3 are larger than that of NiO. In case of the Ni12P5 phase, the slope is larger than that for graphite, indicating that their electrical conductivity is even higher than that of graphite (Fig. 8).119 In nickel phosphide-based electrodes, charge storage is assigned to the Ni3+/Ni2+ redox couple in the alkaline domain, which can be described using the following chemical kinetics.120 Ni2+ + 2OH− → Ni(OH)2(13) Ni(OH)2 + OH− → NiOOH + H2O + e−(14)With the possession of significant faradaic pseudo-capacitance, various stoichiometric forms of MPs have been designed by changing the compositions of Ni and P, including Ni12P5, Ni7P3, and Ni2P. Since the overall supercapacitance performances of the electrode such as specific capacity, rate capability, and cyclic stability strongly depend on its morphology, numerous efforts have been directed to create more active sites by tailoring the morphologies. For instance, Zhichao et al.95 synthesized 6 nm thick nanoplates of Ni12P5 of the size ranging from 5 to 50 nm with a single crystal structure via a simple, template-free wet chemical method. Possessing high electrical conductivity and a large specific surface area (36.6 m2 g−1) that are attributed to the better access of electrochemical active sites through the 2D nanostructures, the ultrathin Ni12P5 nanoplates exhibited superior surface pseudo-capacitive effects along with the EDLC properties. The specific capacity could reach upto 697C g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density and secured 83% retention after 5000 continuous cycles of charging/discharging. Kim and his team successfully demonstrated the formation of highly crystalline, single phase, pure Ni2P nanoparticles using the low-temperature solvothermal approach and revealed improved storage capacity (354C g−1 at 1 A g−1) and high retention capability (80%) at higher current densities with robust cyclic stability.121 This is possibly accredited to the profound valence states of Ni2P with improved electrode kinetics in KOH medium. Consequently, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device employing Ni2P and Fe3O4 as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, allowed an enlarged potential window of 1.6 V, which demonstrated improved energy density (31 W h kg−1) and power density (6400 W kg−1). Here, the Fe3O4 and Ni2P electrodes involved in the device contrarily contributed to reversible faradaic reactions during the charge/discharge of the device, affirming that the combination of the two redox electrodes in a device can deliver improved performance with a balanced power density and energy density ratio compared to conventional asymmetric systems. It is critical to note that for practical applications, a better-performance electrode with higher mass loading of the active material is needed, which is generally achieved by mixing it with polymer binders to ensure good compatibility between the active material and the current collector.25 However, these binders serve as dead weights and did not contribute to the charge transfer reactions. Therefore, considerable efforts have been adopted for self-supported, binder-free, and free-standing MP-based electrodes. For instance, Zhao's group employed a novel approach to construct high-quality Ni2P nanoplates directly on commercial NF as the only nickel source (Fig. 9(a)), and compared with the binder, added Ni2P electrodes on NF as the current collector.96 X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of NF, Ni2P nanoparticles, and the resultant Ni2P/NF composite were displayed, depicting the phase purity of the product (Fig. 9(b)). Moreover, during the phosphidation process, the porous mesostructure of NF was well = retained with a thin Ni2P coating thickness of about 800 nm (Fig. 9(c and d)). The hybrid electrode Ni2P/NF exhibited much better specific capacity of 1032C g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1, which is almost two times greater than that of the Ni2P electrodes synthesized with binder addition (585C g−1 at 2 A g−1) (Fig. 9(e)). Compared to the Ni2P electrode synthesized with the addition of the binder, the in situ grown Ni2P/NF electrode via the direct coupling of Ni2P nanoplates with the current collector in the binder-free strategy offers more active sites, effectively leading to improved electrochemical activity. Notably, even after 10000 charge/discharge cycles, the electrode retained 88% of its original capacitance value (Fig. 9(f)). Besides the cyclic stability, the Ni2P/NF hybrid electrode showed outstanding structural stability and preserved the hexagonal structure even after 10000 cycles of charging/discharging.

2.2.2. Cobalt phosphides. 
As other important phosphides exhibiting alluring properties, cobalt phosphides have gathered significant attention, which is ascribed to the metallic cobalt whose intrinsic higher conductivity than that of nickel promotes elevated electronic transport rates, overshadowing the nickel-based phosphides.122 However, cobalt phosphides show relatively lower specific capacitance but offer ultrahigh cyclic stability, thus making them deserving supercapacitor electrodes. Similar to other counterparts, cobalt phosphides demonstrate typical pseudo-capacitive characteristics, which mainly arise from the redox reactions of Co2+/Co3+.123 It is well known that the boost in the specific capacitance of the electrode material can be achieved by tuning its morphology to create large interfacial area and more reaction sites. Keeping this in mind, several attempts have explored the variety of nanostructured cobalt phosphides and their traditional morphology-dependent electrochemical properties. Jin et al. embraced three-step methods, i.e., hydrothermal-oxidation-phosphidation, to grow one-dimensional (1D) mesoporous CoP nanowires for enhanced supercapacitor performance.124a Initially, the wire-like structures of Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0.11H2O as the precursor were prepared via the hydrothermal method, which underwent calcination at 600 °C for 3 h to obtain highly pure and well-crystallized Co3O4 nanowires with increased robustness. Finally, the low-temperature phosphidation of the as-prepared Co3O4 nanowires with NaH2PO2 as the P source was carried out to obtain the CoP product under N2 atmosphere, where the designed morphology was well-retained with further improved surface state of the nanowires (Fig. 10(a)). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements certified the characteristic mesoporosity of CoP nanowires with 0.53 cm3 g−1 as the total pore volume, resulting in an enhanced specific capacitance of 558 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is nearly twice of that of Co3O4 nanowires, together with better cyclic stability, arising from the 1D structure with abundant mesopores, in addition to the high conductivity (Fig. 10(b–d)). 1D nano-architectures endow advantages to energy storage devices due to their 1D electron pathways and excellent length-to-diameter ratio. Their 1D featured structure is able to bestow electron transport pathways along the axial direction, which can improve the conductivity. On a similar note, uniform 1D Co2P nanoshuttles (20 μm long with a diameter in the range of 30 nm to 300 nm) was reported by Liang et al. through the hydrothermal route, which achieved 246 F g−1 specific capacitance at 1 A g−1 current density with a robust cycle life.105 The exposed rich active surface area of the nanostructured electrode and its utilization efficiency can be improved with an increase in its dimensions. The rational design and synthesis of novel 3D structures manifests good perspectives for enhanced electrochemical performance. A novel 3D hierarchical pompon-like CoP hollow microspheres assembled from crosslinked nanoneedles was developed via the hydrothermal method with subsequent phosphidation.124b Such a unique morphology enabled to achieve 24.6 m2 g−1 specific surface area and 449.4 F g−1 specific capacitance at 1 A g−1. The self-assembled 3D hierarchical hollow network offers a highly porous architecture with a high specific surface area but also reduces the charge-transfer resistances resulting from electrolyte penetration and ion diffusion. Subsequently, an ASC with a maximum working voltage of 1.5 V was assembled employing the as-synthesized CoP and AC as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, delivering 22.2 W h kg−1 energy density at 374.9 W kg−1 power density. It has always been desirable to develop reliable electrode materials possessing nanostructural design, tunable pore size, and high surface area with ambient active sites for efficient ion diffusion/transportation. In this regard, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as porous crystalline materials with unprecedented chemical and structural tunability have been considered to be promising precursors for preparing MPs with hollow structures. For instance, the MOF-derived CoP microcubes with hollow structures (560 F g−1) via low-temperature phosphorization at 350 °C exhibited better supercapacitor performance, when compared with the solid ones (427.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), owing to the large surface area and the unique hollow structure (Fig. 11). The hollow structure can assist in enhancing the electrochemical performance by soothing the interfacial interaction between the active electrode and the electrolyte ions as well as ensure good cycling stability by supplying an extensive space for the deformation in the volume. An ASC device (hollow CoP microbes (CoP-350 °C) as the positive electrode and N-doped graphene as the negative electrode) was shown to have a high energy density of 21.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 373 W kg−1 and prolonged cycle life (retained 81.2% after 6000 cycles).125 With the aim of further improving the electrical conductivity of MOF-derived phosphides, Elayappan et al.126 implemented the binder-free approach, i.e., direct growth of MOF nanostructures on the substrate without adding any binders or additives. Polyhedral Co-MOF as the precursor was first anchored onto CC via the simple precipitation method and then subjected to pyrolysis, which resulted in Co metal nanoparticles embedded in the nitrogen-containing nanoporous carbon (CoNC/CC), where the separate polyhedral was still well-identified. Finally, using a lower amount of NaH2PO2 as the phosphorus source, the Co metal particles were partly transformed into CoP to yield CoP− and Co metal-embedded into nanoporous carbon (CoP-CoNC/CC) by phosphidation. As compared to Co-MOF/CC and CoNC/CC electrodes, the CoP-CoNC/CC electrode demonstrated a maximum specific capacitance of 975 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2, which was attributed to the synergetic effect between CoP, CoNC nanoporous carbon, and the 2D structure of CC. Moreover, an ASC device (CoP-CoNC/CC//AC) was fabricated with CoP-CoNC/CC and AC as the positive and negative electrode, respectively, which delivered a high energy density of 39.2 W h kg−1 at 1960 W kg−1 power density. Zhu et al.127 proposed an effective way for the self-assembled growth of the hierarchical 3D manganese doped cobalt phosphide nanowire-decorated nanosheet cluster arrays on NF (Mn-CoP/NF) by taking different atomic ratios of Mn:Co in the solutions as the binder-free electrode from hydrothermally synthesized Mn–Co-hydroxide nanoarrays and NaH2PO2via the phosphidation process. Doping by foreign elements alters the electronic structure of the original material and introduces defects, which in turn increases the electronic conductivity and number of electrochemically active sites. Among Mn0.05–CoP, Mn0.2–CoP/NF, and CoP/NF, Mn–CoP gave rise to the highest areal specific capacitance of 8.66 F cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2, together with a moderate rate capability (81.2% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles). Moreover, an ASC device comprising Mn–CoP/NF as the positive electrode and AC as the negative electrode was constructed, resulting in an areal capacitance (2.05 F cm−2) higher than that of the ASC device with undoped CoP as the anode. Also, at a power density of 193 W kg−1, the maximum energy density of 35.21 W h kg−1 was achieved for the Mn–CoP/NF//AC device. Note that the lattice defects can significantly influence the capacitive performance of the active material; therefore, the doping content should be finely tuned through both theoretical and experimental investigations.128,129

2.2.3. Iron phosphides. 
Apart from Ni and Co-based phosphides, iron phosphide has gained growing interest recently as alternative non-toxic, natural, earth abundant, low-cost, and environment-friendly electrode materials toward energy storage and conversion.130,131 However, a few reports have emerged on iron phosphide-based electrodes, which is attributed to their relatively low cyclic stability. The poor cycling strength may potentially be obtained from the long-term faradaic reactions of iron-based phosphides, which prompts significant physicochemical change/stress on the electrode material; thus, they are unable to preserve the electrochemical active state fully for a prolonged time. Liang et al.111 synthesized FeP nanorod arrays directly onto CC as the binder-free electrode via the facile hydrothermal route, followed by the phosphidation process. The as-prepared FeP nanotube arrays formed on CC through the sacrificial template demonstrated a typical supercapacitance characteristic with a high areal capacitance of 300.1 mF cm−2 and a specific capacitance of 149.11 F g−1 (at 1 mA cm−2), which is impressively higher than that of the iron-based oxides but depicted drastically unsatisfactory stability of merely 41% after 5000 cycles. Notably, the FeP nanotube arrays displayed outstanding electrochemical properties by virtue of their unique tubular structure, which imparts a favorable ion pathway, reduced the inner inactive material, and thus improved the utilization rate of the active material effectively. The complete solid-state ASC device based on the FeP nanotube arrays and electrodeposited MnO2 was developed using PVA/LiCl as the gel electrolyte, which presented a high volumetric energy density of 2.02 mW h cm−3 at 9.02 mW h cm−3 power density along with good mechanical flexibility. When the electrochemical properties of the as-prepared device were examined under different bending conditions such as normal, bent, and twisted, the shapes of the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were almost found to be identical, affirming the superior flexibility and durability of the device. The concept of rationally designed nanosized structures, especially with mesoporous and hollow features, is devised to develop iron phosphide electrodes with promising cycle life for long-time practical usage. Downsized materials can offer large surface area for better electrode–electrolyte interaction and reduced ion penetration pathways, enabling fast charge-transfer reactions at high rates. For instance, Zardkhoshoui et al.132 performed the phosphidation of electrodeposited FeOOH on NF to develop the FeP/NF electrode with the morphology of interlocked nanoparticles, resulting in an irregular bullet-like structure. Such an electrode depicted nearly quasi-rectangular shaped CV curves in the potential window of −1 to 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl due to Fe3+/Fe2+ charge transfer reaction in 3 M KOH with the capacitance retention of 71.70% (∼200 F g−1) after 5000 cycles. Zardkhoshoui et al. in their other work133 demonstrated the importance of structural engineering through the formation of nanoporous yolk–shell structured hollow microspheres of FeP (YS-FePHS) using the solvothermal method with subsequent phosphorization. The field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image revealed that small nanoparticles were embedded in each microsphere, affirming the porous texture. It depicted a high surface area of 50.3 m2 g−1 and narrower pore size distribution with interconnected channels, enabling numerous active sites and thus facilitating the easy penetration of electrolyte ions. Such a material showed excellent specific capacity of 117.52 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a wide potential range of −1 to 0 V and about 56% of the initial value of capacitance could be sustained even when the current density was increased 25-folds (Fig. 12(a and b)). Evidently, satisfactory robustness of the as-prepared electrode was demonstrated with barely 10.1% reduction in the capacitance value at 5000 charge–discharge cycles owing to the yolk-double shelled hollow structure with improved porosities, which reduced the electron transport/ion diffusion lengths (Fig. 12(c)). More importantly, the ASC device assembled with FeP (anode), ZnGa2S4 (cathode), and KOH (electrolyte) displayed an almost symmetrically shaped GCD profile at miscellaneous current densities at a potential of 1.6 V, indicating that good coulombic efficiency with a specific capacity of 90.97 mA h g−1 (at 1 A g−1) was achieved (Fig. 12(d and e)). Even after 5000 cycles at 9 A g−1, no obvious decrease in the specific capacity was reported, implying satisfactory durability. The maximum energy density of 72.78 W h kg−1 was measured for the device at a power density of 800 W kg−1. Moreover, LEDs with three different colors, i.e., red, green, and blue, were also illuminated to assert the practical application of the device (Fig. 12(f)). Therefore, to boost the electrochemical performance, especially the robustness of the iron phosphide electrodes, structural engineering can be an effective way. The morphologies that exhibit hollow structures with porous features provide not only a high active surface area but also reduced length for charge and mass transport.

2.2.4. Copper phosphides. 
Copper phosphides, another member of the phosphides family, have been recently introduced for electrochemical applications of different kinds such as in energy storage as anode materials for Li and Na ion batteries, and conversion sector,134 in the field of electrocatalysis as an active catalytic material for hydrogen or oxygen evolution reactions,135 and as non-enzymatic sensors for H2O2 detection.136 For instance, Hou et al.137 have directly grown semi-metallic Cu3P nano arrays on the 3D copper substrate as a highly effective electrocatalyst for water oxidation. For the first time, the electronic structure of hexagonal Cu3P was studied using density functional theory (DFT). Their results revealed the semi-metallic character of Cu3P, facilitating efficient electron transfer from the conductive substrate to the surface-bound active centers of Cu3P. Also, copper phosphide exhibits high volumetric along with comparable gravimetric capacity compared to that of graphite due to its unique metallic/semiconducting character.138 Considering other key factors such as chemical stability, cost effectiveness, and environment benignity, it would be a new platform for the researchers to try this compound in the supercapacitor field as a potential electrode material. Notably, only the Cu3P phase remains stable in air among all the Cu–P materials; therefore, few reports on copper phosphide as the supercapacitor electrode are available to date. Jin et al.139 prepared Cu3P nanocrystals by the direct low temperature phosphorization of commercial copper powder with NaH2PO2. The as-synthesized electrode gave rise to a high specific capacitance of 331.8 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in a wide potential range from 0 to 0.7 V in 2 M KOH, which was attributed to the reversible faradaic reactions Cu+/Cu2+ (eqn (15)–(18)). Even when the current density was increased by a factor of 100, an impressive specific capacitance of 169.2 F g−1 was achieved, illustrating the outstanding rate capability. In addition, superior cyclic stability was obtained, which is evident from its 100% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles. Metal-rich Cu3P showed better capacitive performance because of the inherent metalloid characteristics and super electrical conductivity, which is generated by continuous electron delocalization in the sublattice of metal Cu in Cu3P. In a similar direction, Kumar et al.138 reported the synthesis of hexagonal Cu3P platelets using red phosphorus and copper foil (CF) via the phosphorization method. Also, the effect of temperature on the morphology of Cu3P was investigated (Fig. 13(a–c)). It was found that both the higher temperatures and lower temperatures of phosphorization are not suitable for the high-performance material as the hexagonal morphology is lost in the former case, while in the latter case, the hexagonal platelets did not nucleate. Hence, the one which is phosphorized at 450 °C gave rise to the best growth of stacked platelets of hexagonal morphology, which, in turn, significantly enhanced the pseudo-capacitive properties of Cu3P (Fig. 13(d)). The electrochemical performances were studied using CV and GCD in a 1 M Na2SO4 in a voltage window of 1 V from −0.5 to 0.5 V. The appearance of strong redox peaks in the CV curves of the electrode was ascribed to the transition between metallic Cu(0) and Cu(I) species at an applied potential of approximately 0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 13(e)). With an increase in the potential to a positive value, the oxidation of Cu3P to Cu(II) species and hydrous oxide of copper was observed at 0.05 V and 0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively, as described in the following equations. (15) Cu(I)3P + xNa++xe− ↔ Nax{Cu(0)xCu(I)3−x}P(16) Cu(I)3P + H2O ↔ Cu(II)yOyCu(I)3−yP + 2yH+ + 2ye−(17) CuO + H2O ↔ Cu(OH)2(18)

A high specific capacitance of 224 F g−1 at 1.28 A g−1 was obtained together with better rate capability and cycle life of 75%@3000. Controlling the nanostructures and chemical composition is an important method of designing smart electrodes for the enhancement of the electrochemical performance in a supercapacitor system. Furthermore, Chen's group140 has successfully fabricated binder-free Cu3P nanostructure with a unique tube-like morphology on CF via the two-step process of electro-oxidation and phosphidation. Initially, straight and dense nanotube (10 μm in length and about 150 nm in diameter) structures of Cu(OH)2 on the CF surface was developed via electro-oxidation in alkaline solution at 10 °C, which was followed by the phosphorization process, where the designed morphology of the Cu3P/CF electrode remained intact with a slight deformation of the surfaces of the nanotubes to the curled shape. Owing to the rapidly reversible charge–discharge characteristics, the electrode showed an excellent performance of 300.9 F g−1 specific capacitance at 2.5 mA cm−2. To explore its practical application, an ASC was assembled using Cu3P as the negative electrode and CNT/CC as the positive electrode with the CNT-to-Cu3P mass ratio of 0.81. The device delivered a high energy density of 44.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of 17045.7 W kg−1 with 81.9% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles, showing its promising candidature in energy storage application.


2.2.5. Multi-metal phosphides. 
The introduction of a heteroatom is considered to be an effective approach to substantially enhance the electrochemical performance of monometallic systems.141 In multi-metal compounds, the co-existence of different metal ions involving multiple oxidation states could significantly increase the number of redox sites and greatly improve the electrical conductivity and stability, subsequently resulting in markedly ameliorated pseudocapacitive properties and strong synergistic effects.
2.2.5.1. Ni–Co phosphides. 
Among the reported MPs, Ni and Co-based phosphides have attained specific attention and widely explored as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors. However, the studies on Ni-based phosphides have shown that they exhibit high specific capacity but with poor cycling performance. This is possibly because of their inferior structural stability in the long-term charge–discharge process. Upon continuous cycling at high rates, the performance of both the phosphorus-rich and metal-rich nickel phosphides degrades rapidly in the reversible capacity due to their massive volume changes associated with phase transformations during electrochemical measurements.142,143 On the contrary, Co–P possesses the advantages of good rate performance and excellent stability but limited specific capacitance values. Since Co-based compounds, being wide band semiconducting materials, have intrinsically poor electrical conductivity compared to Ni-based materials, it causes sluggish electron transport kinetics.90,144,145 As a result, a significant decrease in the utilization efficiency of the electrode material and lowered specific capacitance was obtained. Thus, Ni-based phosphides display high specific capacitance but suffer from poor rate capability and cycling stability while Co-based phosphides can maintain excellent capacitance rate performance but exhibit relatively low specific capacitance. To address this problem, several reports have emerged on the construction of cobalt nickel bimetallic phosphides nanomaterials with well-defined morphologies such as sheets, wires, rods, particles, and tubes by the incorporation of Co into Ni-based phosphides as high-performance electrode materials in the recent years. For instance, Zhang's group146 successfully synthesized porous nanosheets of bimetallic Ni–Co phosphides with different Ni/Co molar ratios via hydrothermal routes with subsequent phosphorization at various temperatures. Among these, the NiCoP ratio of 1:1 calcined at 300 °C (S–NiCoP-300) showed an ultra-high specific capacitance of 1206 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is much superior to the corresponding single metallic NiP-300 (436 F g−1) and CoP-300 (404 F g−1). Further, the mass loading of S–NiCoP-300 was varied from 0.32 to 13.5 mg cm−2 to study the effect, and the high capacitance value of 2687 F g−1 in the case of low mass loading was observed but very little loading is not real for practical application, while at a large mass loading, it still exhibited a specific capacitance of 1095 F g−1. This may be attributed to the holey sheet-like structure together with the synergistic effect of Ni and Co ions in bimetallic phosphides. Consequently, an ASC device composed of S–NiCoP as the positive electrode and AC as the negative electrode delivered a high energy density of 43.54 W h kg−1 at 150 W kg−1 with robust stability. Further, the device was used to illuminate an LED light and run a motor fan after charging for a shorter time, demonstrating its real-life potential applicability. In the work reported by Zhang et al., no clear comparison between NiP, CoP, and NiCoP on the basis of their cyclic performance was provided. However, there is another research group59 that clearly presented the comparative electrochemical performances of monometallic Ni and Co phosphides with that of bimetallic Ni–Co phosphides with regard to the specific capacity, rate performance, and cycle life. The authors executed three-electrode studies on plasma-converted Ni2P, CoP, and NiCoP sample in 1 M aqueous KOH solution. High specific capacity of 166 mA h g−1 was obtained for Ni2P at a current density of 1 A g−1, though the rate capability (50% at 10 A g−1) and cyclic performance is poor. Only 10% of the initial capacity was retained after 1000 cycles. In comparison, CoP exhibits a relatively low specific capacity of 108 mA h g−1; however, 82% of this value is maintained at 10 A g−1, suggesting good rate performance. CoP also displays superior cyclic stability to Ni2P with a value of 89% after 5000 cycles. Further, bimetallic NiCoP imitates the high capacity of Ni2P and robust cyclability of CoP. Notably, NiCoP shows a specific capacity of 194 mA h g−1 and a capacity retention of 87%, which is superior to the values obtained for single metallic counterparts under the same current density. In addition, prominent stability was achieved for NiCoP upon long-term cycling test. 81% of the initial capacity was sustained after 5000 cycles, which was far better than 10% retention of Ni2P for 1000 cycles and as good as that for CoP. Such comprehensive performance of bimetallic NiCoP can be ascribed to the synergetic effects between Ni and Co, where the former actively participates in redox reactions, while the later stimulates electrochemical activity and shows structural integrity during the durability test. Note that the relatively lower oxidation potential value of Co metal cations than that of Ni results in Co hydroxide formation, which serves as a surface protective layer, preventing Ni from being oxidized and/or to undergo any subsequent phase conversions, thus showing improved stability of bimetallic NiCoP as compared to Ni2P, which is slightly lower than that of pristine CoP.
The engineering of 3D hollow nanostructures has aroused widespread interest in energy storage owing to their strong structural versatility, which can facilitate the ease of electron transport during the redox reactions. Both 3D hollow spheres and microflowers of NiCoP were investigated as supercapacitor electrode materials by Das et al.147 and Jin's group.148 They revealed that mesoporous microflowers of NiCoP exhibited better electrochemical performance, including higher specific capacitance, outstanding rate capability, and stability. Zhang et al.149 demonstrated sacrificial non-spherical metal-formate framework (MFF) template approach to prepare composition-tuned hollow nickel cobalt phosphides microcubes (NixCo1−xP), as depicted schematically in Fig. 14(a). Interestingly, the molar ratio of Ni/Co upto 2 gave rise to the highest specific capacity of 629C g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 compared to Ni–Co–P-0.5 (570C g−1), Ni–Co–P-1 (483C g−1), NiPx (345C g−1), and CoP (only 130C g−1). Moreover, an ASC device based on NiCoP-2//AC was assembled, which showed exceptionally high energy density of 43.2 W h kg−1 with an operation voltage of 1.6 V. The device also illustrated valuable rate performance as well as long cycle life. To further improve the pseudo-capacitive properties of the CoP-based electrode, CC-supported NiCo2Py nanoneedle arrays were fabricated by the incorporation of Ni into CoP by Mu and his team.150 Compared to mono-metal Co-based phosphide nanoneedle arrays, the bimetallic NiCo2Py illustrated impressive pseudo-capacitive properties. Further, an all-solid state symmetric supercapacitor was constructed using two NiCo2Py/CC as the active electrodes and solid PVA/H3PO4 gel electrolyte as the separator, which displayed a specific capacitance of 236.2 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and could retain 87.13% of the initial capacitance after 15000 cycles.

To date, several promising approaches have been put forward to further ameliorate the performance of bimetallic NiCoP in terms of the durability and to matched it with monometallic CoP or even better. It includes (i) designing novel nanostructures through the optimization of the synthetic process, (ii) binder-free approach for the direct growth of active materials on the substrates, (iii) adjusting the composition of constituent metals (Ni, Co), (iv) hetero-atom doping for tuned electronic structures, and (v) fabricating composites with other functionally active materials. Regardless of all the great progresses made so far in bimetallic NiCoP and their supercapacitor applications, there is still a scope for further improvements in their performance to meet the massive energy needs of real-life applications. The present challenges and the future research directions regarding NiCoP materials are summarized below.
(i) Maximum reports are on the synthesis of NiCoP materials through the phosphorization of hydroxides/oxides precursors in an inert atmosphere at the temperatures of 300 °C or above, which requires highly sophisticated apparatus and longer reaction times, while the release of PH3 causes the synthesis to be flammable and corrosive. Thus, innovative methodologies based on low temperature synthesis through simple solution chemistry need to be developed. These approaches could overcome the limitation of high cost, toxicity, and provide tunable structures.
(ii) The choice of the substrate or current collector critically affects the overall performance of the developed active material. Metal foils, metal foams, and carbon cloth are the most commonly employed substrates for NiCoP. Metallic substrates have high electrical conductivity but suffer corrosion or oxidation during synthesis. On the contrary, the CC is less electrically conductive as compared to the metallic ones. The use of novel current collectors (e.g., 3D graphene foam and melamine formaldehyde resin foam) having large surface area, good mechanical stability, and excellent conductivity can manifest significant potential for the ameliorated performance of NiCoP.151,152
(iii) The development of composites based on NiCoP with the rational combination of multiple constituents is an operative strategy to retrieve the electrochemical performance. Numerous reports have been presented on NiCoP nanocomposites, even though spatial confinement and non-aggregated growth of the active NiCoP material are still important considerations. In this context, the anchoring of NiCoP over the 2D layered structure of metal carbides (Mxenes) can provide a new perspective of study on NiCoP-based electrodes.153
(iv) Mostly, an alkaline aqueous solution (KOH) is used as an electrolyte media for electron transport reactions in the supercapacitor studies of NiCoP; however, it may sometimes result in the oxygen evolution reaction, which is undesirable. New industrial grade electrolytes that are low cost and broaden the operating voltage window (for e.g., organic electrolytes, ionic liquids, and all-solid-state electrolyte) are believed to achieve higher energy density of NiCoP electrodes.
2.2.5.2. Other bimetallic phosphides. 
Considering that copper compounds possess ultra-fast electron conductivity and Co-based compounds display great redox activity, Moosavifard et al.154 adopted a facile template-free method to develop multi-shelled nanoporous hollow microspheres of mixed copper cobalt phosphide as an electrode in asymmetrically configured electrochemical capacitors with superior pseudo-capacitive characteristics. Very recently,155 novel hexagonal column arrays of C-doped multi-metallic Co–Mn–Fe phosphides (C-doped CMFP) porous nanoflakes grown directly on NF were fabricated using hexamine and ammonium fluoride, both together leading to the directional growth of grains. In addition to C-doped CMFP, Co–Mn–Fe phosphides (CMFP) and Co–Mn phosphides (CMP) were also prepared under the same conditions for comparison. Among all the electrodes prepared, the C-doped CMFP showed significant specific capacitance of 4.36 F cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2 with no loss in the capacitance even after 5000 cycles. This was originated from its large and porous nanoflakes, the outstanding electrical conductivity, and the carbon doping, which all together enhanced its overall electrochemical properties. The formed ASC device presented the highest energy density of 53.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 39.7 W kg−1 within a stable operational voltage range of 0 to 1.6 V. Despite the gains achieved to date in the optimization of secondary metal ion doping into mono-metal phosphides, their poor rate capability and cycling stability are still critical challenges that need to be overcome. Promoted by this, Lei et al.156 reported recent research studies about bimetallic phosphosulfide Zn–Ni–P–S (ZNPS) nanosheets through the introduction of Zn cations and S anions into Ni–P metal phosphides using a simple two-step hydrothermal procedure, followed by subsequent phosphorization and sulphurization. To gain insight into the effect of the composition on the redox properties, the CV curves of ZNPS in addition to (Zn–Ni–P) ZNP and (Zn–Ni–S) ZNS electrodes were studied (Fig. 14(b)). Obviously, the binder-free ZNPS electrode demonstrated maximum specific capacitance due to the involved different mixed valence states and strong coupling in multi-metal materials. The fabrication and electrochemical performance of the ZNPS//AC asymmetric supercapacitor device is shown in Fig. 14(c). An energy density of 29.01 W h kg−1 at 275.54 W kg−1 power density was measured for the assembled ASC ZNPS//AC device.

2.3. Metal phosphide nanocomposite-based electrode materials
As discussed in previous sections, MPs as n-type semiconductors have triggered an enormous interest in the research community for use as electroactive materials for supercapacitors and displayed fascinating electrochemical characteristics based on the structural parameters obtained. Even so, there is still much room left for further improvement in their performance due to their relatively low activity and unsatisfactory cycling stability. This drives the research interest for the development of phosphide-based composites by the incorporation of one or more type of active materials into phosphide compounds, which will add richer redox reaction sites so that the charge storage mechanism can be enhanced both physically and chemically.157 At present, numerous works have been reported on MP-based hybrids as potential electrodes for supercapacitors, as tabulated, including their corresponding morphologies and capacitance performance. Both binary and ternary metal phosphide composites with two and three active materials are discussed in brief in the following sections. The binary MP composite electrodes thus reported are mostly of MP@carbon or MP@oxides/hydroxide forms but the use of metals, metal sulfides/phosphates, and conducting polymers besides the aforementioned electrodes is also gaining significant importance. Therefore, for an in-depth understanding, these composites have been categorized based on the type of active material combined with the MPs as below.

2.3.1. Metal phosphides-carbonaceous material composites. 
The integration of large specific surface area, low weight carbon-derived materials (e.g., graphene, CNT, carbon nanofibers (CNFs), and graphene oxide (GO)) with MPs to fabricate nanocomposites is considered to be one of the most commonly employed strategy for not only offering abundant active sites and faradaic redox reactions but also evidently minimizes volumetric deformation during the charging/discharging cycles, thereby solving the issue of the structural instability of MPs. In particular, the carbon skeleton can substantially assist the volume variations (expansion and contraction) of electrode materials in fast chemical redox reaction process, and also avoid the agglomeration of active nanoparticles, which would be beneficial for long-term energy storage performance.158
CNFs have shown promise for the development of hybrids owing to their 1D nanostructure, which facilitates the ultrafast ion and electron transport during the intercalation/deintercalation process, leading to reduced inner diffusion resistance. In this direction, the novel Ni2P-CNFs composite of Ni2P nanoparticles uniformly inlaid into the CNFs have been proposed by Peng's group.113 Initially, the Ni-CNFs precursor was synthesized through facile nickel nitrate-assisted polymer (gelatin) pyrolysis at different temperatures from 600 to 800 °C, followed by low temperature phosphorization. The electrochemical properties revealed the specific capacities of 145 mA h g−1 and 99 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.5 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, respectively, for Ni2P-CNFs-700. The superb capacitive performance is attributed due to the following reasons: firstly, unique highly interconnected porous CNFs network provide fast electrically-conductive channels. Secondly, the aggregation of Ni2P nanoparticles is avoided, which enhances the utilization efficiency of the active sites, leading to excellent rate capability. Further, Gopalkrishnan et al.159 successfully reported a free-standing NiCo9P-CNFs hybrid type electrode prepared by the thermal decomposition of NiCo9P hollow nanospheres, which were then incorporated into CNFs through a facile electrospinning route (Fig. 15). The freestanding nanocomposite achieved an improved specific capacitance (200 F g−1 at 0.8 A g−1) compared to Ni1Co9P and also showed remarkable cyclic stability (88.5%@5000). This infers that the building of a free-standing electrode through the incorporation of nano-sized active materials into the conductive carbon framework is an operative approach to boost the energy storage performance.

Graphene is a 2D single atom thick sheet of carbon atoms arranged in a honey-comb like lattice. Graphene sheets possess extraordinary electronic, mechanical, thermal, optical, and optoelectronic properties such as ultrahigh carrier mobility (250000 cm2 V−1 s−1), high thermal conductivity (5000 W m−1 K), and excellent mechanical stiffness (1 T Pa), which make them a much better choice than 1D structured carbon materials for energy storage applications.160 For instance, the hierarchical composite of ternary NiSP nanoparticles in situ decorated on graphene nanosheets (G/NiSP) was designed via hydrothermal, sulfurization, and subsequent phosphorization by Jiang et al.161 The resulting composite gave rise to the highest specific capacity of 1406C g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density, which was ascribed to the strong synergistic enhancement effects between sulfur and phosphorus atoms and the interconnected graphene network.
Moreover, as a robust yet flexible membrane, graphene offers substantially enormous possibilities for the functionalization or modification of its carbon scaffold, forming its derivatives or chemically-modified graphene materials such as graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO).162 Basically, GO is the oxide analogy of graphene with abundant oxygen containing functional groups, resulting in improved electrochemical performance. In a recent work, the synthesis of nickel cobalt phosphide nanowires on 2D GO nanosheets (GO@NiCoP) was performed via the hydrothermal method with subsequent phosphorization. The presence of highly conductive 2D GO nanosheets not only limited the agglomeration of NiCoP nanowires but also provided rich surface functional groups to coordinate with the metal cations of NiCoP, thereby elevating the structural stability. As a result, a high specific capacitance of 1125 F g−1 (155 mA h g−1) at 2 A g−1 and a long cycle life of 104.88% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles was achieved. Furthermore, the fabricated GO@NiCoP//AC ASC device delivered a maximum energy density of 27.71 W h kg−1 at 788 W kg−1. To find its potentiality in practical applications, after charging for 20 s through a solar light source, the set of 25 colorized LED lights can be lit and sustained for 60 s.163
Besides, GO sheets go through the severe problem of restacking because of π–π interactions, the strong van der Waals attraction, and the adsorption of oxidation products during the preparation of the composite electrode, which poorly affects the electrochemical performance and severely reduces the practical surface area.164 To overcome this, the amount of functionalized groups on GO was reduced by chemical, thermal, and electrochemical methods to produce chemically-modified GO, called as rGO, in which the sheets are apart from each other.165 Thus, highly conductive rGO nanosheets have been expected to establish efficient electron transport channels among MPs, leading to a remarkable increase in the overall electrochemical performance. For example, Lv et al.166 studied xrGO/Ni2P via the in situ phosphorization of GO/Ni-MOF with different addition amounts of GO (0.5, 1, 2, 5 mg). The specific capacitance was increased to 788.2 F g−1 at 2 A g−1, when the added amount of graphene was controlled at 2 mg for the hybrid-type electrode (2rGo/Ni2P), together with improved cyclic stability. As the GO amount was further increased to 5 mg, a reduction in the capacitance was observed. The high concentration of rGO might cover some of the exposed redox sites and inhibit the adequate contact of Ni2P to the electrolyte. The fabricated ASC device 2rGO/Ni2P//AC can be cycled reversibly at a cell voltage of 1.5 V. The device also displayed 35.9 W h kg−1 energy density and 7710 W kg−1 power density. FeP-rGO directly on NF was also reported with good electrochemical properties, as expected.132 Hence, fine tuning the composition of the phosphide-based electrode materials through the rational inclusion of carbon can represent an attractive device for creating more efficient electrodes for storage purpose. Highly porous oxygen doped NiCo-phosphides (O–NiCoP) particles immobilized in the rGO network (O–NiCoP@rGO) with controlled degree of phosphorization were studied both experimentally and theoretically.167 The strong synergistic effect from the porous structure of NiCo bimetallic phosphides, lattice defects due to O doping, and the highly conductive rGO network is able to provide favorable electronic structures with zero band gaps, which was also confirmed by DFT calculations. As a consequence, a specific capacitance of 1663.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 was measured, with 89.3% retention of the initial capacitance value even at 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1. The corresponding O–NiCoP@rGO//AC ASC device illustrated a superior energy density of 21 W h kg−1 at a power density of 775 W kg−1, and still retained 12.3 W h kg−1 at 4430 W kg−1. Apart from this, heteroatom-doped graphene-based derivatives are also emerging as an ideal choice to composite with MPs owing to their regulated electronic properties, demonstrating further enhanced supercapacitive properties. For example, hierarchical bimetallic Ni–Co phosphides hollow microspheres with controlled Co/Ni ratios were encapsulated in the P-doped rGO (PrGO) network via a hydrothermal process and subsequent phosphorization reaction using the Ni–Co-based glycerate microspheres as a self-sacrificing template (Fig. 16(a)). The as-prepared PrGO/NiCoP revealed superior electrochemistry performances due to their unique morphologically evolved characteristics from the core–shell, yolk–shell, to hollow and the composition in addition to the PrGo network. An ASC device was also assembled with AC and PrGO/NiCoP, which showed a large energy density of 49.7 W h kg−1 at 0.366 kW kg−1 (Fig. 16(b and c)).168 Despite all the efforts made so far, the self-agglomeration of graphene sheets in addition to low porosity are still challenging obstacles in the way of production of high-quality graphene-based supercapacitors.

Hence, 3D architectures of graphene with micro-(<2 nm) and meso-(2–50 nm) porous structures have been recently developed to tackle the aforementioned issues of 2D graphene-based materials.169 These 3D graphene (3DG)-based materials, when coupled with other active materials, significantly accelerate the mass transport rate, leading to improved comprehensive performances in the composites.170 Kumar et al.138 fabricated a heterostructure Cu3P with interwoven 3DG on the graphite substrate (Cu3P@3DG), which displayed a specific capacitance of 1095.85 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and cycle reversibility (95%@3000) in a broad voltage ranging from −0.5 to 0.5 V. Further, they developed the all-solid state Cu3P@3DG//AC ASC device using PVA/KOH gel electrolyte and achieved the energy density of 8.23 W h kg−1 at a power density of 274.7 W kg−1. To further enhance the capacitive performance of 3DG hybrids, a great achievement in the employment of chemical doping has been made by Chen's group.171 Novel porous N-doped graphene thin microsheets (PNGTMSs) within a 3D honeycomb-like network nanostructure with well-dispersed non-spherical Ni2P nanoflowers (Ni2P-PNGTMSs) were engineered and acquired a specific capacitance of 1100 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 with a residual capacitance of 600 F g−1 at a current density of 20 A g−1. These findings were attributed to the combined effect of PNGTMSs, good dispersion of active Ni2P NFs, and rich exposed Ni2P-PNGTMSs interfaces. It was worth noting that PNGTMSs with the advantages of both 2D and 3D graphene played a significant role in making the hybrid electrode ion-accessible while the good dispersion of Ni2P nanoflowers provides electron transfer and electrolyte diffusion channels (Fig. 17(a)). Moreover, the asymmetric solid-state Ni2P-PNGTMSs//PNGTMSs coin-type cell delivered a high energy density of 39.8 W h kg−1 (at 450.6 W kg−1) within an extended voltage limit of 1.8 V (Fig. 17(b–d)).

In addition, a series of various other MPs-carbon nanocomposite-based supercapacitors with superior performances have also been developed. FeP and NiCoP-based carbon nanohybrids were designed as electrode materials, revealing enhanced improvement in the electrochemical properties. Moreover, growing smart integrated unique core–shell heterostructures with MPs as the core with a coating of carbon layer for the electrode materials proved to have many competitive advantages including abundant electrochemical active sites, short ion/electron transport pathways, and even a strong synergistic effect arising from the multi-components. As a result, Ni1.4C0.6P@C (core@shell microspheres),172 CoP/C (carbon-coated CoP hollow spheres),173 and NiCoP@C (sea-urchin like NiCoP nanoarrays coated with carbon layer)174 hybrid electrodes were reported by researchers that favoring enhanced cycle stability together with drastically improved conductivity. The core–shell structure offered good stability due to the fact that the shell could serve as a shield for the inner material and ensure structural integrity without wrecking and rupturing under the electrochemical scrutiny. Template-free 3D carbon frameworks with Ni2P via a nickel nitrate-assisted polymer (gelatin) in situ ‘gel-blowing’ pyrolysis and subsequent low temperature phosphorization have been reported by Peng and co-workers in 2019.73 They depicted Ni2P nanoparticles anchored on 3D honeycomb-like porous carbon (Ni2P-HCPC). The 3D carbon networks possess good electronic conductivity, high-pitched surface area, and opulent porosity, which altogether provided 3D ion diffusion channels and more redox active sites. This Ni2P-HCPC composite showed faradaic capacitance behavior with a specific capacity of 116 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. An aqueous ASC device based on the as-made composite and bare HCPC achieved a large voltage window of 1.7 V with an energy density of 32 W h kg−1 at 907 W kg−1 and a long lifespan. Encouragingly, Sudhakaran et al.175 devised dielectric discharge plasma deposition strategy to embed nanocarbon over hydrothermally prepared 3D porous Ni2P nanoarrays on NF. This interconnected binder-free Ni2P–C/NF hybrid electrode exhibited a specific capacity of 491.9 mA h kg−1 and was also employed for constructing the ASC device. Moreover, the doping of carbon materials with trace elements such as nitrogen and phosphorus can modify the electronic and crystalline properties of the carbons and are thus expected to further enhance the electrical conductivity, surface polarity, and electron-donor properties.176–178 For instance, MOF-derived cobalt phosphide and cobalt particles embedded into nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon (CoP–CoNC/CC) polyhedra were successfully grown on CC using a simple precipitation method, followed by pyrolysis-phosphatization.126 CoP–CoNC/CC binder-free supercapacitor electrode exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 975 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2 compared to Co-MOF/CC and CoNC/CC. These findings are due to the fact that heteroatom nitrogen in a porous carbon structure offered additional active sites, improving the faradaic capacity of the electrode. The assembled ASC device also revealed superior energy density and good rate performance. Niu et al.179 developed porous P-doped carbon-supported NiCoP nanoparticles (NiCoP@P–C) by introducing the P element into the carbon network as phosphorus possesses higher electron-donor capacity than nitrogen, which is beneficial for improved electrochemical performance. Comprised of AC and NiCoP@P–C-500 as the negative and positive electrodes, the ASC device delivered 57.5 W h kg−1 energy density at 522 W kg−1 power density. As another example, nickel cobalt phosphides nanosheets supported by P-doped C spheres (P-CSs@Ni–Co–P NSs) also demonstrated satisfactory supercapacitive characteristics.180 Wang and co-workers181 reported an ionic liquid-assisted synthetic strategy for hierarchical structured 1D MoP encapsulated in N,P-codoped carbon layer (MoP/NPC). They believed that the presence of both nitrogen and phosphorus together in carbon would integrate the merit of good electrical conductivity along with stable capacitive property. The as-prepared MoP/NPC showed specific capacitance of 544 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1.
Henceforth, numerous works have been reported, suggesting carbon derivatives to be a promising class for composite formation with MPs owing to their high surface area, excellent conductivity, and tailorable structure.


2.3.2. Metal phosphides–metal oxides/hydroxides composites. 
An increasing interest has been found in the development of composite consisting of metal oxides/hydroxides and MPs as the hybrid electrodes for electrochemical capacitors with the anticipation that it would combine the merits and mitigate the drawbacks of both the components. In such hybrid electrodes, metal oxides/hydroxides serve as the main sources that store the charge and the energy owing to their rich electroactivities, and are thus proficient to store more charge at low scan rate or current density.182–184 Furthermore, the high conductivity of MPs has given an enormous boost to the rate capability and power density at a large charge/discharge current.
Wang et al.112 reported a novel core–shell porous T-Nb2O5@Ni2P heterostructure electrode material, where ultra-thin 2D Ni2P nanoflakes were grown on the surface of T-Nb2O5 nanowires using a solvothermal route and post-phosphorization treatment. The T-Nb2O5@Ni2P electrode demonstrated excellent electrochemical properties including a much superior specific capacity of 105 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 compared to bare Ni2P in 2 M KOH, which is credited to the well-controlled surface modification of T-Nb2O5 through interface architecture engineering. Moreover, the as-fabricated T-Nb2O5@Ni2P//AC ASC device achieved a high energy density of 30.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 453 W kg−1 and an extended voltage window of 1.7 V. In addition, Xing et al.185 designed and constructed a 3D hierarchical binder-free CeO2@CoP hybrid-type electrode composed of CoP nanoflowers decorated by CeO2 nanoparticles on the NF via the two-step hydrothermal-phosphorization procedure. The theoretical calculations revealed that with the addition of CeO2, the work function of CoP was greatly improved, leading to the formation of the Schottky barrier at the interface of the CeO2@CoP nanocomposites, thus creating positive-charged holes in CoP due to easy electron migration from CoP to CeO2, which would eventually promote more OH− adsorption, finally enhancing the electrochemical kinetics of the electrode (Fig. 18(a–c)). Furthermore, an ASC device assembled based on the CeO2@CoP/NF composite as the positive electrode and AC as the negative electrode delivered a high energy density of 55.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 955.9 W kg−1 and impressive cycling stability (89%) after 5000 cycles.

Zong and coworkers successfully fabricated NiCo2O4/NiCoP nanoflake-nanowire arrays heterostructure-based electrochemical supercapacitors by controllable phosphorization treatment of NixCo1−x(OH)2 grown on NF. By treating the Ni–Co precursor with 500 mg of NaH2PO2, an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 2288.8 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 was obtained for the composite electrode (NiCo2O4/NiCoP-500).186 This may be due to the abundant lattice defects produced and the formation of the homogeneous heterointerface, which provided rapid electrolyte diffusion by supplying more active sites. Toward practical application, an ASC device based on it and AC was also assembled, which exhibited an energy density of 35.5 W h kg−1 at 750.4 W kg−1. Besides, Jia et al. fabricated a novel 3D hierarchical NiCo2O4/Ni2P heterostructure by electrodepositing 1D Ni2P nanoneedles over the surface of hydrothermally prepared 2D NiCo2O4 nanosheets for different scanning cycles. With 30 scanning cycles, the NiCo2O4/Ni2P-30 (NNP-30) electrode exhibited the highest specific capacity of 2900 F g−1 at a current density of 0.008 A cm−2.187 From the impedance spectra of the NiCo2O4/Ni2P composite electrode and pure NiCo2O4, it is evident that after coating, the Ni2P composite shows smaller diameter of the semicircle compared to that of bare NiCo2O4, suggesting the presence of highly conductive Ni2P nanoneedles, which increased the charge transfer resistance of the NiCo2O4 nanosheets (Fig. 18(d)). In addition, the fabricated NiCo2O4/Ni2P-30//AC ASC device displayed a maximum energy density of 40.7 W h kg−1 at 800 W kg−1 along with a robust cycle life. Similar studies on CoP/Ni2P2O7 and Ni–Co–P/POx by Xu et al.188 and Chen et al.189 illustrated better electrochemical activity, commendable cyclic stability, and comparable rate capability owing to the expected enhancement effect of metal oxides and phosphides. The significant observation for the heterostructures designed from the phosphides and oxides of metal is (i) additional electrons delocalized on the metal surface improving the conductivity, (ii) the lattice defects produce excessive active locations that are favorable for capacitive performance, and (iii) electrolytes efficiently accessed into both the inner and outer active sites of the electrode material.
For hybrid-type electrodes with MPs, hydroxides or layered double hydroxides (LDHs) of transition metals have been interestingly investigated owing to their high capabilities of storing charge through surface redox reactions.190 Importantly, the pivotal aspects for accomplishing highly efficient MPs electrodes are favored by the merits of special layered architecture, large surface area, and tailorable elemental composition of LDHs, which is expected to deliver plentiful active sites as well as quicken the electron/ion transfer. In addition, the internal robustness of the LDHs can acclimate the variations in the volume during charge/discharge, hence strengthening the cycle life of the parent matrix. The traditional 3D core/shell heterostructures of both NiCoP/Co(OH)2 (ref. 191) and NiCoP/NiCo-LDH192 were reported with the highly conductive core of NiCoP wrapped with ultrathin Co(OH)2 nanoplates in the former case and NiCo-LDH nanosheets in the latter. Compared to NiCoP/Co(OH)2, multi-component NiCoP/NiCo-LDH nanocomposite depicted better comprehensive electrochemical performance, which is attributed to the existence of the brucite-like layers with cations and interlayers with anions of NiCo-LDH together with strong synergetic effects between bimetallic ions. Furthermore, corresponding ASC devices NiCoP/Co(OH)2//AC and CC/NiCoP@NiCo-LDH//AC showed competent energy density of 37 W h kg−1 at a power density of 750 W kg−1 and 57 W h kg−1 at a power density of 850 W kg−1, respectively.


2.3.3. Other metal phosphide-based composites. 
Composites containing metals, conductive polymers, and transition metal sulfides with pronounced redox activities are also considered to be potential candidates for hybrid supercapacitor devices. Recently, Li et al.193 conducted a reaction temperature-regulated study of hydrothermally prepared Ni–P. The Ni–P nanowires (NWs) obtained at 160 °C was then calcined at 500 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere to form 3D Ni–P@Ni nanotubes porous network. The results indicated that the Ni–P@Ni hybrid electrode with considerably increased BET surface area (49.5 m2 g−1) and specific capacity (771.8C g−1@1 A g−1) compared to its precursor Ni–P NWs suggested that the generation of pure Ni in Ni–P@Ni after calcination eased the electrical contact between the electroactive material and the current collector for facile ion diffusion. Strikingly, the assembled Ni–P@Ni//AC ASC device showed a maximum energy density of 58.7 W h kg−1 at a power density of 945 W kg−1. Another novel approach for designing superior supercapacitive nanocomposites composed of CC-supported FeP nanorod arrays coated with highly conductive conducting polymer PEDOT (CC/FeP/PEDOT) has revealed promising outcomes with the maximum areal capacitance of 790.59 mF cm−2 (217 F g−1) at 1 mA cm−2, which is almost two times higher than that of pure FeP (438.9 mF cm−2 (149.11 F g−1)). Moreover, it also demonstrated an outstanding stability, where it could retain 82.12% of its initial capacitance after 5000 cycles, compared to 24.19% for the bare FeP. With excellent conductivity and mechanical stability, PEDOT polymers exhibited improved electrochemical performance and mechanical properties of the hybrid types. The aqueous MnO2//FeP/PEDOT ASC device achieved outstanding electrochemical properties through capacitance and energy density.100 Recently, Naderi and group194 reported a novel fiber-shaped micro-supercapacitor, which delivers new functionalities compared to conventional energy storage devices, employing NiCuP and NiVS as composite materials, where NiVS nanosheets were hierarchically grown on NiCuP porous film coated Cu wire via the two-step process-hydrothermal method, followed by the sulfidation process (c-NiVS/NiCuP/CW). The authors also conducted the capacitive studies of the electrochemically deposited NiVS nanoparticles on NiCuP/Cu wire substrate (e-NiVS/NiCuP/CW) for comparison (schematic shown in Fig. 19(a)). It was shown that NiVS nanosheets deposited on the 3D porous film provide a large electrode surface area and excellent specific capacitance of 13.4 F cm−2 (1.7 F cm−1 and 1342.28 F cm−3) at a current density of 4 mA cm−2, compared with the NiVS nanoparticles. With the merits of richer redox reactions and narrow band gap, metal sulfides can also be employed to develop composites with MPs. To assimilate its practical applicability, a fiber-shaped solid-state c-NiVS/NiCuP/CW//rGO/CF ASC device with high energy delivery, good mechanical flexibility, and large operational voltage was achieved (Fig. 19(b)). This advanced research has brought an important breakthrough in next generation flexible and portable fiber-based energy storage microdevices. Another research group has reported CC-coated NiFeP/NiCo2S4 nanosheet arrays for ASCs, which also showed very promising performance.195 Similarly, the novel design of the composite electrode was realized by growing NiCoP@NiCoP core–shell leaf-like arrays directly on CC. In such a composite, the maximum specific capacity of 1125C g−1 (312 mA h g−1) is obtained through the combined contributions from highly conductive NiCoP, 3D porous core–shell structure, and conductive substrate.196

2.3.4. Ternary composites. 
Indeed, binary composite materials possess good electrochemical performance; however, low electron conductivity is still limited to support ultrafast electron transport, which is desired for commercial supercapacitor applications.197 Therefore, a great deal of focus has been raised on designing and constructing ternary MP-based hybrid materials through the combination of three different type of materials in a single electrode. Xu et al.198 successfully synthesized N-doped-carbon incorporated Ni2P/Ni (Ni2P/Ni/C) ternary nanocomposite from Ni-MOF precursors. This novel structure couples the merits of high porosity, conductive network, and good charge transfer ability offered by carbon, Ni2P, and Ni. As a result, the maximum specific capacitance of 257.2C g−1 at 1 A g−1 was achieved for Ni2P/Ni/C-100 with 100 mg of NaH2PO2. The higher content of the metal can provide unhindered transportation of electrons for charge transfer reactions, while the carbon contributes the electrochemical double layer capacitance, altogether increasing the total capacity of the prepared composite. An energy density of 25.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 750 W kg−1 was obtained from the assembled ASC device using Ni2P/Ni/C-100 and porous carbon as the positive and negative electrode, respectively. A similar study on the Ni2P/Ni/C composites was reported by Hou et al.,137 displaying a specific capacitance of 1449 F g−1 in 2 M KOH for 150 mg of NaH2PO2 (NP-150). Also, when assembled with AC as the negative electrode, a very high energy density of 32.02 W h kg−1 (@700 W kg−1) and long cycle life (about 99% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles) were achieved. Wang et al.199 adopted a high temperature phosphorization approach to develop core–shell Ni–NixPy@C nanocomposites immobilized on P-doped sponge-like porous carbon (Ni–NixPy@C/P-HPC-900), which demonstrated an ultrahigh specific capacity up to 1275 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with good cyclic stability (92.5%@5000). This may be attributed to the integrated merits of fast electron transport kinetics offered from the interconnected P-doped network, high theoretical capacities of Ni and Ni–P entities, and superb conductivity of carbon. Xu and coworkers200 successfully fabricated a binder-free Ni2P/Ni/TiC nanocomposite film on Ti substrate, which enabled exhibiting excellent results of the specific capacitance as high as 160.0 mF cm−2 at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, and an energy density of 42.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1550 W kg−1. Such outstanding findings were ascribed to the involvement of redox reactions of pseudo-active Ni12P5/Ni entities over the TiC surface along with outstanding conductivities of Ni12P5, Ni, and TiC, thus eventually accelerating the electron/ion transport. Dang et al.201 investigated the properties of homologous 3D NiCoP/CoP hetero-nanosheets network anchored on N-doped CNTs (N-CNTs@NiCoP/CoP) with different Co/Ni ratios, and found that the N-CNTs@NiCoP/CoP (Ni:Co = 1:2) showed the highest specific capacity of 152 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 and retained 61% of the capacity when the current density was increased to 30 A g−1, revealing good storage capacity. There are several factors that govern the output performance of the hybrid electrode including the relative amount of the active metals and the carbon content.
A comparative evaluation on nano NiO/NF, rGO/NiO/NF, and Ni2P/rGO/NiO/NF composites was conducted by Shih et al.202 for high performance supercapacitor electrodes via the two-step electrochemical deposition of GO and Ni2P on the NF. The study revealed that there is an increasing order of areal specific capacity measured from the CVs at 10 mV s−1 in 2 M KOH (electrochemical deposition time of 10 min): NiO/NF-10 (0.394C cm−2) < rGO/NiO/NF-10 (1.52C cm−2) < Ni2P/rGO/NiO/NF-10 (3.68C cm−2), demonstrating that the ternary composites could be more superior than the binary composites if the optimal conditions were maintained. Moreover, the corresponding Ni2P/rGO/NiO/NF-10 electrode-based all-solid-state ASC device successfully lightened up an LED light to reveal its feasibility in practical applications. Similarly, Zong and coworkers (2019)203 adopted a novel approach of constructing ternary nanocomposites of core–shell NiCoP@C@Ni(OH)2 nanoarrays with NiCoP nanowire-nanoflakes as the core and amorphous carbon and Ni(OH)2 nanosheets as the shell. Benefitting from the contribution of different components, the high specific capacitance of 2300.8 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, good rate performance, and better cycle life were achieved. An ASC device with NiCoP@C@Ni(OH)2 binder-free battery-type electrode was also fabricated.
A report is available on novel NiSe/Ni3S2/Ni12P5 composite composed of NF self-supported NiSe/Ni3S2 heterostructure nanofiber arrays with Ni12P5 nanoparticles to gain a large mass loading of 8.5 mg cm−2, an ultrahigh areal capacity of 2.04 mA h cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2 (272 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1), and robust cycle life.204 The corresponding transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images are displayed in Fig. 20(a and b). The authors claimed that the redistribution of electron densities within the heterostructure along with the introduction of conductive and productive MP, Ni12P5 nanoparticles on the surface of the NiSe/Ni3S2/NF-1:1 nanofibers account for improved electrochemical performance for the composite with an areal capacity that is 1.9, 5.7, and 17 times higher than those of NiSe/Ni3S2/NF-1:1 (1.08 mA h cm−2), NiSe/NF (0.36 mA h cm−2), and Ni3S2/NF electrodes (0.12 mA h cm−2), as manifested from Fig. 20(c). Further, the variation in the storage capacities as a function of mass loading was studied (Fig. 20(d)). The improvement of the areal capacity may be ascribed to the self-supported vertically grown nanofibers, which could facilitate the electron movement from the electrode surface to the current collector even at a higher mass loading. In addition, an ASC assembled by the NiSe/Ni3S2/Ni12P5/NF-1:1 electrode against AC also displayed outstanding storage performance in terms of the energy density (9.23 mW h cm−3 at a power density of 84.8 W cm−3).

The application of MPs as an efficient electrode material for supercapacitor devices is a leading field. Several rational systems with metals, metal oxides/hydroxides/sulfides/selenides, conducting polymers, and carbon allotropes have been discussed to enhance the performance of the MPs with conducting substrates and different nanostructured design. Significantly, the pivotal attributes for achieving high performance supercapacitor electrodes are the exceptional conductivity and surface area, which come from carbon compounds. Therefore, in hybrid devices, only carbonaceous materials' enrichment can aid large contact area and rapid electron transport for ion diffusion.

3. Remarks
MPs materials have emerged as promising materials along with their hybrids/nanocomposites as robust and efficient electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. In comparison to the conventional carbon-based, metal oxides/hydroxides, or conducting polymer-based electrode materials, which have been rather well established so far, MPs demonstrate much improved performance in several fundamental directions. Being n-type semiconductors, MPs are known to possess metalloid characteristics with excellent electric conductivity and open-framework networks, enabling efficient and ultrafast electron/ion transport. Moreover, the wide diversity of MPs in terms of crystal structures, compositions, and stoichiometries enables the flexibility of tailoring various technical variables, along with the chemical stability. Benefitting from these scientific merits and well-matched theoretically prediction, an extensive work has been reported to advance and perceive them in-depth. In this article, typical recent leading and frontier studies of these MPs, in correlation with their exploitation in the supercapacitor field, have been reviewed. We have explored the investigated supercapacitive performances of MP-based electrode materials and discussed the impact of the morphology, surface area, and the resultant structure over their electrochemical performance.
Interestingly, many investigations performed in-depth studies on the novel nanostructured materials via fabrication processing techniques, their properties optimization, and supercapacitive performance enhancement. Several advanced synthetic methods such as solvothermal, solid-state reaction, and CVD, using different P sources, have led to the preparation of a wide array of MPs covering cobalt phosphides, nickel phosphides, iron phosphides, copper phosphides, and the optimization of the properties of these materials through the fine-tuning of the involved synthetic parameters has provided an insight into their electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the capacitive performances of the electrode are strongly dependent not only on the specific surface area but also on other structural features such as the pore structure, pore distribution, and surface functionalities, which are tailored by the processing controls. Another consideration is the internal electric resistance that needs to be lowered for improved overall device/cell performance. As a result, growing MPs nanostructures over the large surface area, highly porous, and conductive current collectors for their direct use as binder-free electrodes for supercapacitors have been attracting significant interest.
To enlarge the commercial applications of supercapacitors in the field of energy conversion and storage, the enhancement in energy density and large operational voltage is urgently demanded. Consequently, this leads to further study, research, and development of the composites, where MPs are incorporated with other purposely designed functional components, which can not only enhance the electrical conductivity and offer large electroactive surface but also prevent volumetric deformation during cycling. A further fascinating development is the MP-based ternary composites to fully utilize the benefits and nullify the drawbacks of each respective component of the composite as the two components alone cannot satisfactorily accomplish the needs of a high-performance supercapacitor. Many types of active materials to be integrated with MPs, including carbonaceous materials, metal sulfides/oxides/hydroxides, and conducting polymers, have been appraised. In order to explore the complete aptitude of MP-based hybrids, a thorough understanding of the mechanism of synergies involved in context of interface chemistry and physics is required to be further studied.
4. Conclusion and future perspectives
It is concluded that for developing highly efficient MP-based hybrid electrode materials, the structural features such as specific surface area and feasible redox active-centers are the key parameters to achieve maximum energy/power densities. There is a need to come up with structural modifications using more novel and innovative manufacturing processes in order to create the designed MPs with the desired electrochemical properties. Appreciating these synthetic methods that have been outlined in this review, there will still be room available for further development as the performance measured is lower than the theoretical value for several MPs. With the view of improving the stability and flexibility of the active materials, the fabrication of the MPs–polymer composites can be further investigated as a few reports are available. More research is expected to improve the energy storage capacity of the ASC devices through the proper selection and optimization of the electrolyte, besides the choice of positive and negative electrodes. The electrolytes operated high voltage, having high ionic conductivity and thermal stability, should be employed, which can offer large supercapacitors working voltage window. The high rate of self-discharge is also another consideration that needs to be examined in order to effectively use the ASC device at the commercial level. Moreover, the cost and facile production of MPs should be realized to allow their large-scale device fabrication and applications.
