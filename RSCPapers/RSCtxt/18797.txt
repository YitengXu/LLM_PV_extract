    , Accepted 21st January 2014First published on 21st January 2014AbstractOleic acid-capped NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ upconversion nanocrystals (UCNCs) with different sizes and crystalline phases were prepared, and their temperature-dependent upconversion luminescence (UCL) and dynamics were studied. It is interesting to observe that the temperature-dependent behavior of UCL for the β-phase (25 nm, 45 nm and bulk) and α-phase (<10 nm) UCNCs is quite different. The UCL intensity of Er3+ ions of the β-phase NaYF4 demonstrates a maximum around 100 K, while the intensity of the α-phase quenches monotonously with elevated temperature (10–400 K). The intensity ratio of 2H11/2–4I15/2 to 4S3/2–4I15/2, RHS, increases solely with temperature for β-phase NaYF4, while for the α-phase sample, it demonstrates a complex and indeterminate variation as a function of temperature. In the β-phase samples, rising processes were observed in the dynamics of Er3+ ions, while in the α-phase sample, no rising process was observed and the decay processes of Er3+ ions were bi-exponential. The rationale for these different temperature-dependent UCL properties was explained carefully.
1. Introduction
Upconversion (UC) phosphors, which can convert a low frequency excitation photon into a high frequency emission photon through two-photon or multi-photon processes, have attracted great interest in recent decades owing to their unique photoluminescent features and a large number of application potentials, such as background lighting sources, solid-state lasers, infrared detection, solar cell conversion, etc.1–6 In particular, some rare earth (RE) doped fluoride UCNCs are attracting extensive current interest because of their relatively high UC efficiency and significant application potential in the field of in vivo imaging, infrared (IR) photo-dynamic therapy, bio-labels and bio-sensors.7–9 Among various fluoride UC phosphors, the microsized polycrystalline powder of β-phase NaYF4:Yb, Er is considered as one of the most efficient under the excitation of a 980 nm laser diode, however, its UC efficiency is only 3%, and that of the corresponding nanosized phosphors (∼10 nm) is only one of tenth of the microsized form.10,11 Therefore, it is important to further improve the efficiency of the fluoride UC phosphors and to search for novel efficient UC phosphors.
It is known that the UCL strongly depends on dopant concentrations, excitation power, crystallite phases and particle sizes, and thermal conditions.12–15 Actually, there are two types of crystallite phases in NaYF4 at ambient pressure and temperature: the cubic phase (α-phase) and the hexagonal phase (β-phase). It was reported that the UC intensity of the green emission of β-NaYF4:Yb, Er is 10 times stronger than that of α-NaYF4:Yb, Er and the overall (green plus red) emission of the former is 4.4 times higher than that of the latter.16–18 Generally, with the decrease of particle size, the UC strength was suppressed due to the improved surface adsorption of large phonon bonds, such as water and the unexpected crystallinity of smaller nanoparticles (NPs), and, the ratio of the green to the red was also considerably modulated.19,20 Despite a number of studies related to NaYF4:Yb, Er UCNCs having been performed, some significant problems have not been completely understood. For instance, essentially, how the change of crystalline phase as well as particle size influences the UCL of the phosphors, including radiative transition, nonradiative relaxation and ET processes.
The studies on temperature-dependent UCL and dynamics of NaYF4:Yb, Er UCNCs with different particle sizes and crystalline phases are significant for understanding these questions. Temperature has two effects on the UCL of nanomaterials. On the one hand, it can generate heat radiation and stimulated luminescence, on the other hand, it promotes the nonradiative transitions and quenching.20–22 The study of their variable temperature spectra will help to further understand UC mechanisms and the use of the materials for potential thermal sensing and biosensor applications.21,23 It was reported24 that the luminescent intensities of Er3+ and Yb3+ codoped Y2O3 nanocrystals decreased with the increasing temperature from 10 K to 300 K. This effect was explained by the enhancement of nonradiative multiphonon relaxation rates, which reduces the radiative transition probability at high temperatures. Van der Ziel et al.25 found that the intensities of YF3 increased and then decreased with the temperature raising up to room temperature. The depopulation of the higher sublevels of the 4I11/2 at lower temperatures and multiphonon deexcitation at higher temperatures were proposed as dominant factors that govern the temperature-dependent behavior. Shan et al.26 reported UCL of NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ UCNCs at various temperatures from 300 K to 450 K and observed a similar phenomenon. So far, there is no complete work related to temperature-dependent UCL and dynamics of NaYF4:Yb, Er with different sizes and crystalline phases.
In the present work, we prepared oleic acid (OA)-capped NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ NCs with different sizes and phases and investigated their temperature-dependent UCL and dynamics systematically. Some interesting temperature-dependent UCL properties were observed, which depended on both the crystalline phase and particle size of NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ UCNCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
All of the chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. NaOH, NH4F, methanol, and cyclohexane were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Octadecene was purchased from Sigma (America). OA (>90%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar. Rare earth (RE) chlorides (LnCl3, Ln:Y, Yb, Er) (>99.99%) were purchased from Baotou Ruike Functional Materials Co. Ltd.
2.2. Synthesis of NaYF4:Yb, Er UCNCs
The OA-capped NaYF4:18% Yb, 2% Er NCs were synthesized following a procedure reported previously.27 Firstly, YCl3 (0.2416 g), YbCl3 (0.0697 g) and ErCl3 (0.0077 g) were mixed with 6 ml OA and 15 ml octadecene (ODE) and heated to 160 °C to form a homogeneous solution, and then cooled down to room temperature. Then, 10 ml methanol solution containing NaOH (0.1 g) and NH4F (0.148 g) was slowly added into the solution with magnetic stirring, then the solution was stirred continuously for 30 min. Subsequently, the solution was heated to 120 °C to form a pellucid solution and removal of residual water and oxygen, then heated to 280, 300, or 320 °C and maintained for 1 h under nitrogen atmosphere to prepare NCs with different sizes. After the solution was cooled down naturally, NCs were precipitated from the solution with ethanol and washed with cyclohexane for three times. The bulk material was obtained by annealing the 320 °C sample at 600 °C for 3 hours.
2.3. Characterization
The size and morphology of as-prepared UCNCs were recorded on a Hitachi H-8100IV transmission electron microscope (TEM) under an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The as-prepared samples were dispersed in cyclohexane and dripped onto a copper grid for the TEM tests. The crystalline structure and purity of the as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray power diffraction (XRD) with a Rigaku D/max 2550 X-ray diffractometer, using a monochromatized Cu target radiation source (λ = 1.54 Å). The UCL spectra were measured by an Andor Shamrock SR-750 fluorescence spectrometer. A CCD detector combined with a monochromator was used for signal collection from 300 nm to 850 nm. A continuous 980 nm diode laser was used to pump the samples for the measurement of steady-state emission spectra. In the measurement of UC dynamics, a tunable Nd:YAG laser pumped OPO laser was used as the excitation source, with a pulse duration of 10 ns, repetition frequency of 10 Hz and line width of 4–7 cm−1 and was fixed at 980 nm. All measurements were tested under vacuum, and the temperature was changed from 10 K to 400 K.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and morphology of the NaYF4:Yb, Er UCNCs
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of as-prepared NaYF4 prepared at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 1(a–c), with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image in Fig. 1(d). A histogram of the particle size distribution was obtained by direct observation on TEM bright field images, as shown in Fig. 1(e–g). It can be seen that when the reaction temperature was at 280 °C, small NaYF4 UPNCs were formed and they showed a rather wide size distribution. The mean particle size was determined to be 6.5 ± 6.1 nm. From the high-resolution patterns, a fringe with lattice distance of 0.3 nm was observed, corresponding to the (111) face of cubic NaYF4, implying the formation of a crystalline phase. However, it is also clear that some regions contained an amorphous phase. As the temperature increased further, the average sizes of NaYF4 UCNCs increased and became homogeneous, which were 25 ± 1.5 nm when prepared at 300 °C and 45 ± 1.9 nm at 320 °C. For the annealed bulk sample (see Fig. 1d), the shape of particles is irregular due to the accumulation of small NPs, and the size of the particles ranges from several hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers. Fig. 1h shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared NaYF4 UCNCs fabricated at different temperatures in comparison to the standard cards of α-NaYF4 and β-NaYF4. It can be distinguished that the samples prepared at 280 °C demonstrate the cubic phase (JCPDS: 077-2042). As the reaction temperature increases to 300 °C, NaYF4 has transformed into β-phase. At higher temperature, the pure hexagonal phase also appears (JCPDS standard card no. 28-1192).

3.2 Power-dependence of NaYF4:Yb, Er UCNCs
The normalized UCL spectra of NaYF4:Yb, Er UCNCs with different sizes under the excitation of a 980 nm laser diode are shown in Fig. 2a. In all the emission spectra of NaYF4:Yb, Er UCNCs, the blue 2H9/2–4I15/2, green 4S3/2, 2H11/2–4I15/2 and red 4F9/2–4I15/2 transitions can be clearly identified. The green emissions of 4S3/2, 2H11/2–4I15/2 are dominant for all the samples. It can be seen that the intensity ratio of the red to green slightly increases with the decreasing particle size. It should be noted that the overall emission intensity of the samples increases considerably with the increasing particle size, as reported by the previous literature. Previously, we systematically studied the size-dependent UCL behavior of NaLuF4:Yb, Er with different phases, α-phase and β-phase, and observed that they demonstrated opposite results in that for the β-phase NaYF4, the intensity ratio of red to green slightly increases with the decreasing particle size, while on the contrary, in the α-phase sample, the intensity ratio of red to green decreases remarkably with the decreasing particle size. The difference of size-dependent UCL between α-phase and β-phase samples was attributed to the contribution of cross-relaxation processes.30 In the α-phase samples, the cross-relaxation process happened easily due to the random distribution of rare earth ions, while in the β-phase samples, the cross-relaxation process hardly occurred due to the strict distribution of rare earth ions.30

(b) The schematic of the luminescence processes of NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ under the excitation of 980 nm light. The solid lines present radiative transitions and the dashed lines are nonradiative ones. 

Fig. 2b shows the schematic of the UC excitation pathways and the emission processes for the NaYF4:Er3+, Yb3+ under 980 nm excitation.19 Firstly, Er3+ ions on 4I15/2 are excited to 4I11/2 by the ground state absorption (GSA) and/or energy transfer (ET) of Yb3+–Er3+. Then the same laser pumps the excited-state electrons from the 4I11/2 to the 2H11/2 levels via excited-state absorption (ESA) or the second-step ET of Yb3+–Er3+, the electrons relax to 4S3/2, 2H11/2, generating green 4S3/2, 2H11/2–4I15/2 transitions. The populating pathway of the red 4F9/2 level is as follows: after populating the 4I11/2 level, the electrons further relax to 4I13/2, then are excited into 4F9/2, generating 4F9/2–4I15/2 transitions. Besides, the nonradiative relaxation from the green 4S3/2, 2H11/2 level to 4F9/2 is another pathway for the population of the red level. The populating of the blue level is a three-photon process: some of the electrons on the red 4F9/2 are further excited into 2H9/2 through the third-step ET of Yb3+ to Er3+, and generating blue 2H9/2–4I15/2 transitions. Generally speaking, as the particle size decreases, due to the increase of the ratio of surface to volume, a number of surface defects with available large vibrational modes such as CO32− and OH− are involved. Large vibrational modes results in the increase of nonradiative relaxation channels, 4I11/2–4I13/2 and 4S3/2, 2H11/2–4F9/2, leading to the relative increase of the red transitions. It should be also noted that as the doping concentration is high enough, cross-relaxation of 4F7/2 + 4I11/2 − 4F9/2 + 4F9/2 also occurs significantly, leading to the relative increase of the red emissions.
To further reveal the UC mechanism, the blue (2H9/2–4I15/2), green (2H11/2/4S3/2–4I15/2) and red (4F9/2–4I15/2) emissions were measured as a function of excitation power, as shown in Fig. 3. Following the UC mechanism, the visible emission intensity is proportional to a certain power (n) of the infrared excitation intensity. For the blue emission, the values of n were determined to be 1.43, 2.19, 1.29 and 1.12. For the green emission, the values of n were determined to be 1.38, 1.62, 1.34, and 1.92. For the red emission the values of n were determined to be 1.40, 1.97, 1.49 and 1.04. As is well known, for any upconversion mechanism, the value of n presents the number of IR photons absorbed per visible photon emitted. For the two-photon processes (red and green emissions), n should equal or be close to 2 and for the three-photon processes (blue emission), n should be close to 3. However, in our experiment, the values of n were much smaller than the photon number for the transitions. This was mainly attributed to the competition between linear decay and UC processes for the depletion of the intermediate excited states, which was theoretically described by Pollnau et al.22 It can be deduced that when the particle size decreased from bulk to 25 nm, the value of n increased gradually, which was attributed to the suppression of the saturation effect. As the particle size decreased, the linear decay process would increase due to the increase of nonradiative relaxation processes. Oppositely, when the particle size decreased from 25 nm to several nanometers, the value of n decreased, which could be attributed to greatly improved local thermal effect. For the 6 nm UCNCs, nonradiative transition process will increase significantly due to its worse crystallinity and improved surface adsorption. The local thermal effect will induce the temperature of the sample at the irradiated site to increase with the excitation power. Slight thermal quenching will cause the value of n to decrease, while strong thermal quenching will even lead to the decrease of UCL intensity with the excitation power.28

3.3 Temperature-dependent UCL spectra of NaYF4:Yb, Er NCs
The temperature-dependent UCL of NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ NCs with different sizes were compared under 980 nm excitation, as shown in Fig. 4. It is interesting to observe that for the 6 nm α-phase sample, the intensity of UCL decreases solely with the increase of temperature for all the red, green and blue transitions, which can be attributed to significant thermal quenching of UCL due to its worse crystallinity and surface adsorption of water. For the other β-phase UCNCs (25 nm, 45 nm and bulk), the UCL intensity of Er3+ ions first increases with elevated temperature, and it demonstrates an optimum at a certain temperature, and then decreases with further increase of temperature, for all the transitions. For the bulk sample the optimum appears around 100 K, and for the 25 nm and 45 nm samples, the optimum appears around 150 K. Suyver et al.29 pointed out that there is an energy gap between the two lowest crystal-field components 2F5/2|0> and 2F5/2|1> of the Yb3+ ions and the ET from 2F5/2|1> to the lowest energy crystal-field component 4I11/2 state of the Er3+ ions is very efficient. On one hand, with the increase of temperature, the relative population on 2F5/2|1> of the Yb3+ ions will increase, leading to the increase of the excitation of Yb3+, as a consequence, the ET from Yb3+ to Er3+ will be more efficient, and the UCL intensity increases with the increase of temperature. On the other hand, the nonradiative relaxation processes will increase with the increase of temperature, leading to the quenching of UCL. These two competing processes lead the appearance of an optimum of UCL intensity at a certain temperature.

Blue light (a), green light (b) and red light (c). 

Fig. 5(a) shows the temperature-dependent UCL spectra of the 6 nm α-phase. For the 6 nm sample, the UCL of 2H11/2, 4S3/2–4I15/2 and 4F9/2 at 10 K has broader bands and the Stark splitting of the emission lines for different transitions is not obvious. This suggests that the local environments surrounding the Er3+ luminescent centers are very disordered and the inhomogeneous broadening of the emission lines is quite great. In the other words, the luminescent centers of Er3+ for the poorer-crystalline NaYF4 contribute dominantly to the UCL at low temperature (10–50 K). Above 100 K, the broader emission bands nearly disappear and the emission lines with distinct Stark splitting can be clearly identified. The above result indicates that the luminescent centers surrounding the disordered local environments have completely quenched above 100 K due to possible ET from the centers to the defect states. It should be noted that previously we studied the frequency-selective excitation spectra of Eu3+ ions in some oxide compounds NCs such as Y2O3 and YVO4 and identified different symmetry sites, inner sites and surface sites and observed that the emissions of the centers locating on the surface sites became broader, and the luminescent lifetime of the centers became shorter.30,31 From Fig. 5(a) it can be also seen that the overall intensity ratio of the red emission to the green emission (Rr/g), and the intensity ratio (RHS) of 2H11/2–4I15/2 to 4S3/2–4I15/2 also varies significantly with temperature. For instance, it is surprising to observe that RHS as well as Rr/g first decreases with the elevated temperature ranging between 10–100 K, and it then increases with the elevated temperature in the range of 150–300 K.

For comparison, the temperature-dependent UCL spectra of the 45 nm β-phase NaYF4 sample are shown as Fig. 5(b). It can be seen that the 45 nm and the 6 nm samples demonstrate different temperature-dependent UCL behavior. The obvious differences can be concluded as: (1) the Stark splitting of the emission lines for Er3+ ions can be distinguished at any temperature. (2) RHS increases solely with the elevated temperature. When the temperature is below 100 K, the transition of 2H11/2–4I15/2 cannot be identified due to low electron population of 2H11/2. It should be highlighted that for the other samples, (25 nm, bulk), the temperature-dependent behavior of the UCL is similar to that of the 45 nm sample. In order to better understand the temperature-dependent behavior in different samples, RHS and Rr/g as a function of temperature in different samples are shown as Fig. 5(c) and (d), respectively. As is well known, the intensity ratio RHS of 2H11/2–4I15/2 to 4S3/2–4I15/2 is sensitive to temperature, and is a critical parameter to mark the temperature change in UCL processes. In Fig. 5(c), RHS for the β-phase (25, 45 nm and bulk) NaYF4 UCNCs increases solely with elevated temperature. The population distribution on 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 should be dominated by Boltzmann's thermal distribution and elevated temperature leads to rapid population of 4S3/2–2H11/2. The population ratio of 2H11/2–4I15/2 to 4S3/2–4I15/2 can be written as, RHS = αe−ΔE/KT(1)where α is a constant, ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels (2H11/2 and 4S3/2), K is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The experimental data of the β-phase samples can be fitted by eqn (1) very well. The 6 nm α-phase NaYF4 sample differs from the others, in which the RHS decreases with the increasing temperature and reaches a maximum around 100 K. Until now, this behavior has not been completely understood. Previously, Liu and co-workers studied the temperature-dependence of photoluminescence of Er3+ ions in Y2O3 nanotubes and also observed an indeterminate phenomenon. They observed that even at low temperature (∼10 K), the population of 2H11/2 could not be neglected and the photoluminescence of 2H11/2–4I15/2 could be observed, unlike the microsized powders and they attributed it to the contribution of special electron–photon coupling modes for one-dimensional NPs.32 In the present case, we suggest that the indeterminate temperature-dependence of RHS for the 6 nm sample is related to its imperfect crystallinity. In the disordered system of the local environment, the nonradiative transition rate of 2H11/2–4S3/2 might be very large and might be comparable to the radiative transition rate of 2H11/2–4I15/2 and even the thermal activation rate of 4S3/2–2H11/2. In this case, RHS can not be simply described by eqn (1), but should be described by a modified model.35 It should be also pointed out that the indeterminate relationship between RHS and temperature might be also related to the local thermal effect induced by the laser irradiation.
The intensity ratios Rr/g as a function of temperature were also obtained, as shown in Fig. 5(d). It can be observed that for the bulk sample, Rr/g increases solely with the elevated temperature, which can be attributed to the increase of nonradiative relaxation rates of 4S3/2–4F9/2, 4I11/2–4I13/2. For the other samples, the variation tendency is similar above 100 K, however, the variation degree is not as large as the bulk sample, and the variation below 100 K is more complex.
3.4 Temperature-dependent UCL dynamics
In order to deeply understand the UCL behavior in NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ UCNCs with different sizes and phases, the temperature-dependent dynamical processes of the excited states (4F13/2, 4S3/2, 4F9/2) for Er3+ ions were measured and compared under the excitation of a 980 nm pulsed laser. Fig. 6 shows the typical dynamical processes of 6 nm (α-phase) and 45 nm (β-phase) NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ at different temperatures. It can be seen that in the 6 nm α-phase sample no rising process was observed for all the 2H9/2–4I15/2, 4S3/2–4I15/2 and 4F9/2–4I15/2 transitions (see Fig. 6(a–c)). An immediate decay of the emission intensity after the excitation pulse (without a rise) points toward ground state absorption followed by excited state absorption (GSA/ESA).33
 Fig. 6  The UCL decay time of the transitions at 416, 544 and 656 nm of Er3+ ions in 6 nm α-NaYF4 (a), (b) and (c); 45 nm β-NaYF4 (d), (e) and (f) samples with different temperature. 
This result suggests that as the particle size is small enough, the ET from Yb3+ to Er3+ is insufficient. There are several possible factors leading to this point. First of all, as the particle size decreases to several nanometers, the ET efficiency will be suppressed due to the boundary effect of nanoparticles.34 Second, in the α-phase UCNCs prepared at relatively low temperature, a number of defect states should be involved, which can be judged from imperfect crystallinity of the sample. Furthermore, a number of large phonon bonds such as OH− groups would be involved unavoidably on the surface of the nanoparticles.32 These two facts will result in the improvement of nonradiative ET processes from Yb3+ ions to defect states and/or OH− groups, which compete with the ET processes from Yb3+ to Er3+. From Fig. 6(a–c) it can be also seen that for the 2H9/2–4I15/2 and 4S3/2–4I15/2 transitions, the decays of the emission intensities are all bi-exponential, which depend strongly on temperature and can be written as,36 I(t) = I1exp(−t/τ1) + I2exp(−t/τ2),(2)where τ1 and τ2 represent the shorter and longer lifetime constants, respectively, and I1 and I2 are the original contribution for the shorter and longer decay times, respectively. The shorter time constants are in the range of several tens of microseconds, while the longer time constants and in the range of several hundreds of microseconds. From the temperature-dependent dynamics it can be seen that for the 2H9/2–4I15/2 transition, the contribution of the shorter decay process decreases quickly with the increasing temperature, and when the temperature is above 30 K, the shorter decay process nearly disappears. For the 4S3/2–4I15/2 transition, the relative contribution of the shorter decay process slowly decreases with the elevated temperature. It is suggested that the appearance of bi-exponential decay processes comes from the emissions of Er3+ ions at different local environments, the shorter process corresponds to the emissions of Er3+ ions with disordered local environment or on the surface of nanoparticles, while the longer process corresponds to the emissions of Er3+ ions at relatively neat crystalline local environment. It should be noted that in some of our previous works, we studied the site symmetry of some oxide compounds, such as Y2O3:Eu3+ and YVO4:Eu3+ nanowires and nanoparticles by laser-selective excitation and observed that as the particle size decreases to several nanometers, the emissions of Eu3+ ions originating from surface sites occur, which are with relatively broad lines and short lifetimes.37,38
The UCL of Er3+ ions with different local environments demonstrate different temperature-dependent behavior. The emissions of Er3+ ions with disordered local environments demonstrate quick temperature quenching, while Er3+ ions with neat crystalline local environments yield slow temperature quenching. This is well in accordance with the temperature dependence of emission spectra.
The temporal evolution of β-phase NaYF4:Yb3+, E3+ (45 nm) as a function of time can be fitted to a Vial's type equation, for all the 2H9/2–4I15/2, 4S3/2–4I15/2 and 4F9/2–4I15/2 transitions: I(t) = I1exp(−t/τD) − I2exp(−t/τR)(3)where τD and τR represent the decay and the rise of the emission, respectively. τD is essentially the UCL lifetime, which is influenced by the lifetime of the emitting level and the lifetime of the levels feeding the excited states through the energy transfer process. The rise time τR is determined by the lifetime of the emitting state and the ET rate from Yb3+ to Er3+.37,39 From the best fitting functions it can be seen that the rising time constant first increases with the increase of temperature when the temperature varies from 10 K to 30 K, and it then decreases with the further increase of temperature. It should be noted that for the 25 nm and bulk samples, their luminescent dynamics are similar to those of the 45 nm samples, and their temperature-dependent dynamics are shown as Fig. S1 and S2,† respectively.
In order to better understand the temperature-dependent luminescent dynamics, the rising and decay time constants as a function of temperature for different samples are shown as Fig. 7. It can be seen that the rising time constants for the 25 nm, 45 nm and the bulk samples demonstrate similar variation tendency. Generally, in the 25 nm, 45 nm and the bulk samples, for all the transitions the rising time constants first rapidly increase with the increase of temperature from 10 K to 30 K, and then gradually decrease with the increase of temperature above 30 K due to the increase of nonradiative relaxation rates for different emission levels (see Fig. 7(a), (c), (e)). From Fig. 7(b), (d) and (f), it can be seen that for most cases, the decay time constants decrease with the increase of temperature. As is well known, the decay time constant is the reverse of the sum of the radiative and nonradiative transition rates of the cross-relaxation processes. The radiative decay rate for an emission level rarely changes with temperature, while the nonradiative decay rate varies significantly with temperature, thus the luminescent lifetime τ for any level can be roughly expressed as, (4)where W represents the radiative transition rate for the emission levels, W(0) represents the nonradiative transition rate from the emission level to the nearest down level at 0 K, ħω is the phonon energy for multi-phonon relaxation process and ΔE is the energy gap between the emission level and the nearest down level. The majority of experimental data can be well fitted by eqn (4). By fitting, W and W(0) for different emission levels 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 were obtained, and the optimum fitting values were listed in Table 1. It can be seen that W increases with the decrease of nanocrystalline particle size. There are two factors affecting the radiative transition rate of RE ions doped NCs, effective refractive index effect and lattice distortion effect.40 The radiative rate for the electric-dipole transition increases with the increase of refractive index of the phosphor. Meltzer et al.41 reported that the radiative transition rate of Y2O3:Eu NCs is dependent of not only the refractive index itself, but also the surrounding medium, which can be expressed as, neff = xn + (1 − n)nmed, where x is the filling factor showing what fraction of space is occupied by the nanocrystals and nmed is the refractive index of medium. Based on this function, the radiative transition rate for RE ions should decrease in comparison to the corresponding bulk material owing to the effective refractive index effect.41 However, in some NCs, the imperfect crystallinity could induce the degeneration of lattice symmetry, and thus the radiative transition rate increases with the decrease of particle size.42 In Table 1, it can be also observed that W(0) increases with the decrease of particle size for the 4S3/2–4I15/2 transition, however, for the 4F9/2–4I15/2 transition, W(0) surprisingly increases with the decrease of particle size, which has not been clearly understood yet.

4. Conclusions
In this work, we studied the temperature dependence of UCL and dynamics of NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ UCNCs with different particle sizes and crystalline phases and observed some interesting phenomena. First of all, we observed that for the 6 nm α-phase NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ UCNCs, the overall UCL intensity decreased solely with the increasing temperature, while for the β-phase NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ UCNCs ranging of several tens to thousands of nanometers, the UCL intensity as a function of temperature demonstrated an optimum around 100 K. Second, for the β-phase NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ UCNCs the intensity ratio of 2H11/2–4I15/2 to 4S3/2–4I15/2 (RHS) increased solely with temperature and could be well fitted by the Boltzmann's distribution function, while for the α-phase NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ UCNCs RHS demonstrated a complex and obscure temperature dependence. Third for the β-phase NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ UCNCs, the UC dynamics demonstrated a rising process for all the visible UC transitions due to the sufficient ET from Yb3+ to Er3+, while for the α-phase NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ UCNCs, the rising process completely disappeared due to insufficient ET, and the decay processes were bi-exponential due to surface effects. Their physical origins were carefully discussed.
