    , Accepted 12th June 2019First published on 18th June 2019AbstractRecently there have been extensive efforts to develop novel two-dimensional (2D) layered structures, owing to their fascinating thickness-dependent optical/electrical properties. Herein, we synthesized thin GeP nanosheets that had a band gap (Eg) of 2.3 eV, which is a dramatic increase from the value in the bulk (0.9 eV) upon exfoliation. This Eg value is close to that of the GeP monolayer predicted by first-principles calculations (HSE06 functional). The calculations also indicate a strong dependence of Eg on the number of layers (2.306, 1.660, 1.470, and 1.397 eV for mono-, bi-, tri-, and tetralayers, respectively), and that the band edge positions are suitable for water splitting reactions. Field-effect transistor devices were fabricated using the p-type GeP nanosheets of various thicknesses, and the devices demonstrated a significant decrease in the hole mobility but an increased on–off ratio as the layer number decreased. The larger on–off ratio (104) for the thinner ones is promising for use in novel 2D (photo)electronic nanodevices. Further, liquid-exfoliated GeP nanosheets (thickness = 1–2 nm) deposited on Si nanowire arrays can function as a promising photoanode for solar-driven water-splitting photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells. Based on the calculated band offset with respect to the Fermi levels for the two half-reactions in the water splitting reaction, the performance of the PEC cell can be explained by the formation of an effective p-GeP/n-Si heterojunction.
1. Introduction
Since the discovery of two-dimensional (2D) carbon materials (graphene), extensive efforts have been devoted to searching for other novel 2D nanostructures in which the atomic layers are stacked by van der Waals forces. The reduction of a material's dimension from bulk (3D) to 2D results in remarkable changes in its optical and electrical properties such as an increased band gap and carrier mobilities due to the quantum confinement effect. Graphene has an extremely high carrier mobility (∼105 cm2 V−1 s−1) and ballistic transport, and it is semi-metallic without an intrinsic bandgap.1–3 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDs, e.g., MoS2 and MoSe2) nanosheets have recently attracted much attention owing to their sizeable bandgap energy (Eg).4–9 The monolayer TMD possesses an Eg much larger than that of the 3D bulk (1.9 vs. 1.1 eV) and exhibits photoluminescence following a unique quantum-confined indirect-to-direct bandgap transition.10,11 Group V mono-elemental phosphorene (black phosphorus) is another promising 2D material.9,12–17 Its Eg value increases from 0.35 to 1.7 eV as the number of layers is reduced to one, thereby providing great opportunities for designing high-performance electronic devices.
Binary IV–V compounds such as Si–P, Si–As, Ge–P, and Ge–As systems have emerged as another class of potential 2D materials.18–35 A number of theoretical studies have predicted that their monolayers have bandgaps wide enough (2–3 eV) to efficiently collect visible-light photons, and the bandgap positions are appropriate for visible-light-driven water splitting.21–31 We have previously reported that GeAs nanosheets with a few layers exhibit Eg = 2.1 eV, which is consistent with the value from first-principles calculation using the HSE06 functional.31 These GeAs nanosheets can catalyze water oxidation under solar irradiation. On the other hand, recent pioneering studies focused on the unique anisotropic optical and electrical properties of GeP and GaAs nanosheets.32–35 However, no experiments have been reported to determine the band gap of GeP nanosheets, although calculations predicted the band gap of monolayers to be 1.68–2.44 eV.22–25,28,29,34
Herein, we synthesized 2D GeP nanosheets using a mechanical exfoliation method. Liquid-phase exfoliation using tip sonication produced a few layers, and the optical bandgap increased to about 2.3 eV. First-principles calculations using the HSE06 functional were performed to predict a significant increase of Eg with a decreasing layer number (from four to one). The value of Eg = 2.306 eV for the monolayer agrees well with the experimental bandgap. For practical applications, we fabricated field-effect transistors to show the trends of lower carrier mobility and higher on–off ratios as the layer number decreases. Finally, Si-GeP core–shell nanowire (NW) arrays were fabricated to demonstrate that decorating Si NWs with liquid-exfoliated GeP nanosheets could enhance the performance of solar-driven water-splitting photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of GeP nanosheets
Bulk GeP crystals were synthesized by a melt-growth method, using a solid-state reaction of Ge and P powders inside an evacuated quartz tube reactor. The starting materials, Ge and P powders (99.999% and 99.9%, respectively), were purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as received. Mixed powders with 1:1 molar ratio (1 g of 0.7 g Ge and 0.3 g P) were placed inside an evacuated quartz ampoule (1 cm outer diameter, 2–3 cm length, 2 mm wall thickness), which was sealed and heated slowly to 1100 °C over 24 h followed by annealing for 48 h. After annealing, the sample ampoule was cooled down slowly to room temperature for 24 h.
For the liquid exfoliation, 20 mg GeP crystals were added to 10 mL N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous, 99.5%). In order to obtain the exfoliated samples for structure analysis, the GeP/NMP was sonicated for 2 h using an ultrasonic bath sonicator (Hwashin 605, 40 kHz, 350 W). The GeP/NMP solution was further placed in a high-density probe-type ultrasonicator (Sonics VCX-130; 20 kHz, a maximum power output of 130 W) operating at an amplitude of 20%, and sonicated for 2 h. The temperature of the reaction vessel (50 mL) was kept at 20 °C by immersing in a water jacket connected to a circulator with a temperature controller. The sonication tip was pulsed for 10 s on and 2 s off to avoid excessive heating. After exfoliation, the solution was centrifuged at 15k for 20 min. The supernatant was collected using a pipette. The exfoliated GeP was collected on an anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane (pore size = 20 nm). The GeP/NMP solutions were dropped onto the Si substrate (1 cm × 1 cm) with a 300 nm SiO2 surface layer, and subsequent characterization was carried out after drying the sample in a vacuum dryer. Characterization of the products is described in the ESI.†
2.2 Computational methods
Our calculations are performed based on density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).36,37 Electron–ion interactions were described by the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method,38 which is essentially a frozen-core all-electron calculation. The lattice constants and atoms of GeP nanosheets were optimized using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional combined with the D3 correction method of Grimme (PBE-D3).39 For structure optimization, atoms were relaxed in the direction of the Hellmann–Feynman force using the conjugate gradient method with an energy cut-off of 400 eV, until a stringent convergence criterion (0.01 eV Å−1) was satisfied.
We defined the X and Y axes to be parallel to the longer (a) and shorter (b) dimensions of the rectangular primitive cell, respectively. Two, three, and four layers of GeP were built from monolayers stacked along the c axis, as in bulk GeP. For each system, we maintained a sufficiently large vacuum space of 15 Å along the c direction to ensure that there was no appreciable interaction between two adjacent supercells. The k-point sampling was performed using a 4 × 20 × 1 grid, which guarantees the accuracy of total energy to be less than 1 meV. Since the PBE functional significantly underestimates the Eg values, all band structure calculations were done using the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional,40 from which the absolute positions of band edge states were extracted. The intrinsic carrier concentrations per volume in the GeP monolayer and bulk GeP were calculated from the relationship,  where D(E) and fFD(E) are electronic densities of states obtained from the HSE06 calculation and the Fermi–Dirac occupation, respectively. They can be converted into concentrations per area (pi(2)) by multiplying by the appropriate c constant.
3. Results and discussion
In the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns shown in Fig. S1,† the peaks match with those of the monoclinic phase GeP (a = 15.140 Å, b = 3.638 Å, c = 9.190 Å, and β = 101.1°) reported by Wadsten.18 The Raman spectra confirmed the anisotropic Raman modes that are consistent with those reported by Li et al. (Fig. S2†).34Fig. 1a shows the ball-and-stick model of the calculated crystal structure of GeP. The primitive cell is marked by a tilted box: every Ge atom is coordinated to three P atoms and another Ge atom, while every P atom is coordinated to three Ge atoms. Each layer is terminated by P atoms, and the layers are stacked by van der Waals forces. The basal and lateral planes are at the [20] and [010] zone axes, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shows the lamellar structures of the GeP crystals (Fig. 1b), while the inset photograph is of a 1 cm GeP crystal chunk. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image reveals that the cleaved GeP nanosheets always have a rectangular shape, indicating the existence of a preferred cleavage plane (Fig. 1c). For the area marked as (i), lattice-resolved TEM and fast Fourier transform (FFT) images of the basal planes (at the zone axis of [20]) confirm the single-crystalline nature of GeP nanosheets. The [102] direction, which is perpendicular to the [010], is the preferential cleavage axis, probably because there are fewer atoms along this axis. The d spacing between the neighboring (204) planes along the cleavage axis ([102]) is 2.1 Å, which is consistent with the reference value of d204 = 2.117 Å. Along the edge (marked as area (ii) and zone axis: [010]), the d spacing between the (20) interlayer planes is identified as d20 = 6.4 Å, the same as the reference value (6.367 Å). High-angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and the energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (EDX) mapping of Ge L shell and P K shell peaks confirm the homogeneous distribution of Ge and P elements throughout the nanosheets (Fig. 1d). The EDX spectrum shows an atomic ratio of Ge:P = 1:1.

The photographs (circular insets) in Fig. 2a show the bulk powders and liquid-phase exfoliated (in NMP) nanosheets of GeP deposited as films on AAO membranes. The color changed from dark gray to yellow upon exfoliation. The Eg of bulk GeP was measured to be 0.9 eV (1400 nm) using the UV-visible-near infrared diffuse reflectance spectrum (in absorption mode) scanned over a range of 380–1550 nm (0.8–3.2 eV). The absorption spectrum of GeP nanosheets shows a large blueshift with an onset wavelength of 550 nm, corresponding to Eg = 2.3 eV. The SEM image shows the successful exfoliation into nanostructures (Fig. S3†). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was also used to determine the size and thickness of the GeP nanosheets (Fig. 2b). The AFM image of samples deposited on the SiOx substrates shows that a majority (80%) of the nanosheets are thinner than 2 nm (corresponding to 1–3 layers) and their size is below 100 nm.

To validate the dramatic change of the Eg in GeP with the number of layers, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on a combined method that has been known as the most reliable way to predict the Eg of 2D semiconductors.24,27,31 Namely, the band structure was calculated using the HSE06 functional with the PBE-D3 lattice parameters, since the electronic structure is very sensitive to the lattice parameters. From now on, we will use 1L, 2L, 3L, and 4L to denote the monolayer, bilayer, trilayer, and tetralayer systems, respectively. It should be emphasized that there has been no reported systematic comparison for the electronic structure of GeP nanosheets with different numbers of layers (NL) using this approach.

Fig. 3a–d show the band structures of the GeP 1L–4L, obtained using the HSE06 functional calculations. For the 4L GeP, we calculate the HSE06 band structure in the limited k-path of [Γ,Y] (see the PBE calculations in Fig. S4†). Table 1 summarizes the results of Eg = 2.306, 1.660, 1.470, and 1.397 eV for NL = 1–4, respectively, showing a significant decrease as NL increases. All the systems exhibit indirect electronic transitions from the valence band maximum (VBM) at the S′ and Y′ points, which are slightly off from the Γ point along the paths Γ–Y and Γ–S. However, the gap is quasi-direct for the monolayer, because its difference from the direct gap of the monolayer is comparable to the thermal energy (0.026 eV) at room temperature. Remarkably, the bandgap of the monolayer is in good agreement with our experimental value of liquid-exfoliated GeP nanosheets (2.3 eV). Our calculated bandgap is also similar to those previously reported using the same functionals.22–24,28–30 With an increasing number of layers, Eg is expected to decrease to approach the experimental value for bulk GeP (0.9 eV), which is consistent with our band gap of 0.94 eV in the HSE06 band structure as shown in Fig. S4.†

Fig. 3e displays the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) positions for NL = 1–4 relative to the vacuum level. As NL decreases, the VBM is lowered while the CBM is destabilized. The Fermi levels for the two half-reactions in water splitting at pH = 13 are marked in the graph: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at −3.67 eV and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at −4.90 eV. The VBMs of all layers are located appreciably below the Fermi level of the OER. Even for the 4L system it is still 0.29 eV lower. Meanwhile, their CBM values lie below the Fermi level of the HER. Therefore, the GeP nanosheets could be optimized for photochemical water splitting, if they can be used as a p-type photoanode to form a heterojunction with an appropriate n-type material in such a way that their CBM are shifted upward to above the Fermi level of the HER.
Next, the thickness-dependent electrical properties of GeP nanosheets were examined by fabricating a bottom-gate field-effect transistor (FET) on the SiO2/Si substrate and measuring the FET characteristics. Fig. 4a shows the source–drain current (ISD) as a function of gate voltage (VG) obtained from the FET device under ambient conditions. The dimension of the electrodes and the calculation are shown in Fig. S5 and Table S1.†VSD was set at 0.05–1 V in the linear region that follows the ohmic contact behaviors. Due to the anisotropic electrical properties, all electrodes were fabricated using the long axis of GeP nanosheets as shown in Fig. S6 and Table S2.†ISD increases as VG becomes more negative for all thicknesses, indicating that the GeP nanosheets are p-type semiconductors.
 Fig. 4  (a) Source–drain current (ISD) vs. gate voltage (VG) curves (measured at 300 K) for the FET devices fabricated using the GeP nanosheets (thickness: 5.7, 7.8, 10.6, and 31.2 nm). (b) Carrier mobility and on–off ratios as a function of the thickness of GeP nanosheets. 
From the linear region of the ISDvs. VG curve, the channel mobility of the 2D device, μ, was estimated to be 0.030, 0.033, 0.13, and 4.24 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the thicknesses of 5.7, 7.8, 10.6, and 31 nm, respectively, and the on–off ratio was 104, 20, 10, and 1. The gate effect of the FET devices was also analyzed for other thicknesses (see Table S1†). Fig. 4b shows the carrier mobility and on–off ratio as a function of the thickness. The mobility increases dramatically with increasing thickness. The on–off ratio reaches 104 for the thinnest nanosheets but decreases significantly to 1 with increasing thickness. This result is consistent with the study of Li et al., who obtained μ = 0.35 and 5.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 3.1 nm thickness and in the bulk, respectively, and the on–off ratio decreased from 104 to 1.34
The thickness-dependent mobility may arise from the charge-impurity scattering.41 As the nanosheets become thinner, the carriers spend more time near the ionized impurity (probably p-type doped Ge vacancies) and thus the scattering probability of ions is increased, resulting in a lower carrier mobility. Furthermore, the lower mobility of the thinner nanosheets reduced the off-current, which can be supported by the increased resistivity (0.13 Ω cm for 31.2 nm vs. 3262 Ω cm for 5.7 nm) and the reduced carrier concentration (3.55 × 1013 cm−2 for 31.2 nm vs. 3.62 × 1010 cm−2 for 5.7 nm). On the other hand, the free carriers can only be gated in the bottom layers due to charge screening, thus the thinner nanosheets have higher modulation capability to increase the on–off ratio.42 The results for the temperature-dependent gate effect are shown in Fig. S7.† The carrier mobility decreases with decreasing temperature, following the charge-impurity scattering model. The resistivity as a function of temperature shows that the electrical conductivity follows a 2D variable-range-hopping mechanism (Fig. S8†).43
Next, we test the GeP as photoanode material in a water-splitting PEC cell. n-type Si nanowire (NW) arrays were synthesized using n-type Si wafers via an etching process, and the liquid-phase exfoliated GeP nanosheets were deposited onto the Si NWs. Fig. 5a shows a typical SEM image of vertically aligned Si-GeP NW arrays on a large area (1 cm2) of the Si substrate. The length of the Si NWs is 6 μm. The HRTEM image shows that the GeP nanosheets are deposited homogeneously on the surface of Si NWs, forming a core–shell structure (Fig. 5b). The thickness of the deposited GeP nanosheets was found to be 1–2 nm. Fig. 5c shows the HAADF STEM image, the EDX elemental mapping (Ge L-shell, P K-shell, and Si K-shell), and the corresponding EDX spectra. The Ge and P atoms exist in a 1:1 ratio in the nanosheets (in the shell part) and Si only exists in the NWs (in the core part).

(d) Current density vs. potential (vs. RHE) for the Si-GeP photoanodes measured in a 0.1 M Na2SO4/0.25 M NaOH (pH 13) electrolyte under AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) conditions. The scan rate is 20 mV s−1. (e) Band diagram of the GeP (2L)-Si p–n junction (in the absolute energy scale with respect to the vacuum level in eV) at a bias voltage of 0.35 V, after coming into contact with the pH 13 electrolyte under light irradiation. The Fermi levels of the OER and HER are shown on the left and right side, respectively. The band edge positions at the flat band potential (i.e., onset potential) are marked with black dots. The quasi-Fermi levels of minority carriers are denoted as  and . 

Fig. 5d shows the plot of the current density (J in mA cm−2) vs. the applied potential (V) for the water-splitting PEC cell using either bare Si NW or Si-GeP NW photoanodes under simulated solar irradiation (AM1.5G at 100 mW cm−2 using a Xe lamp). The potentials reported here are referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The potential was anodically scanned from 0 to 2 V at a rate of 20 mV s−1. The current responded quickly during the light on/off cycles (with a time interval of 2 s). The photocurrent of the bare Si NWs exhibited a significant decrease (with large spikes) during the first scan, probably due to the fast oxidation. The photocurrent density was about 0.8 mA cm−2 at the water oxidation potential (E0 = 1.23 V, marked by a vertical line). The onset potential was estimated to be about 0.35 V. A smooth photocurrent curve was generated by connecting the “on” signals.
Compared to the bare Si NWs, deposition of the GeP nanosheets enhanced the photocurrent to 2.3 mA cm−2 at E0. The onset potential is about 0.25 V, which is negatively shifted by about 0.1 V from that of the bare Si NWs (0.35 V). The evolution of hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) was simultaneously measured for 1 h in a closed PEC cell by in-line gas chromatography (see Fig. S9†). The stoichiometric ratio of H2:O2 was close to 2, and the faradaic efficiency was about 75%. This result confirms that the photocurrents are generated by water splitting. Solar energy conversion efficiency (η) as a function of the applied potential was calculated using the current–potential curves as shown in Fig. S10a and Table S3.† The maximum η value was 0.65% (at 0.72 V), so the solar-to-H2 conversion efficiency was 0.49%. The incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency measurements show that the GeP nanosheets enhance the photoresponse (Fig. S10b†). The morphology and electronic structures of Si-GeP photoanodes after 1 h of water-splitting reaction were analysed (Fig. S11†). We compared our results with recent studies on Si photoanodes by other research groups (Table S4†).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were carried out to evaluate the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) in the dark and under light irradiation (Fig. S12 and Table S5†). The Si-GeP NWs have a smaller Rct value than the Si NWs, indicating that charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface occurs more efficiently when there is a GeP shell. The Mott–Schottky plots confirmed the p-type semiconducting behavior of GeP nanosheets in the electrolyte, as shown in Fig. S13.† The flat band potential of Si-GeP NWs is negatively shifted from that of Si NWs in the dark, which is consistent with the onset potential shift in the PEC cells.
Here, we propose that a p–n junction is formed between the p-type GeP nanosheets and the n-type Si NWs. Fig. 5e shows a band diagram for the p–n junction of the GeP 2L (Eg = 1.66 eV)-Si (in the absolute energy scale with respect to the vacuum level) under irradiation at pH 13. The bias voltage is 0.35 V, which is 0.1 V higher than the onset potential. Therefore, there is an upward band bending of 0.1 V for n-Si in contact with the electrolyte. As the first step, the Fermi levels of GeP and Si NWs before and after their contact in the dark were calculated (see details in Fig. S14†). The intrinsic 2D hole concentration of the 1L was calculated to be 2.28 × 10−5 cm−2 using the electronic densities of states and the Fermi–Dirac occupation and the value is much lower than that estimated from the experiment (109). The GeP nanosheets were thus heavily doped with holes, probably due to the Ge vacancies. As a result, the Fermi level (EFp) of GeP is located 0.83 eV below its intrinsic level (EFi), which is almost the same as the VBM level. The Fermi level of n-Si is increased by 0.30 eV above the intrinsic level, so that EFn lies 0.29 eV below the CBM level. Since there are fewer carriers in GeP than in Si, the Fermi level of the p–n junction will be pinned at EFn(n-Si). The space charge region (SCR) is only formed at the interface between GeP and Si, while the inside of Si remains intact as n-type. The potential drop in the n region would be larger than that in the p region.
The HER is initiated by photoelectrons generated in GeP, since its quasi-Fermi level  of the minority electron under irradiation fully satisfies the condition of  > EF(HER). Likewise, the OER will be initiated by photoholes generated in the SCR of n-Si, since the quasi-Fermi levels of the minority hole in the SCR of n-Si satisfy the condition of  < EF(OER). The photoelectrons and photoholes generated in the SCR will drift in opposite directions, due to the built-in electric field (1.34 eV, see the calculation in Fig. S14†). More specifically, the photoelectrons generated in the SCR of p-GeP will drift toward the cathode for the HER, while the photoholes generated in the SCR of n-Si will drift toward the electrolyte for the OER. The upward band bending would prevent a portion of the photoelectrons from flowing into the electrolyte so that the HER is enhanced. Nevertheless, self-oxidation is inevitable during the water splitting reaction, which decreases the photocurrent at potentials higher than 1.5 V.
4. Conclusions
We synthesized 2D GeP nanosheets by exfoliating GeP crystals that were grown using a melt-growth method. The nanosheets consisted of a monoclinic phase with the layers stacked along the [20] direction. The cleavage direction is consistently [102] to produce parallel long edges in the nanosheets. Upon exfoliation using tip sonication in NMP, Eg increased from 0.9 (bulk) to 2.3 eV, as identified using the UV-visible absorption spectra. First-principles calculations using HSE06 functionals showed that Eg = 2.306, 1.660, 1.470, and 1.397 eV for the 1L, 2L, 3L, and 4L, respectively. The experimental band gap is consistent with that of monolayers. The electrical properties of GeP nanosheets showed a strong dependence on the thickness: the mobility is 0.030 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 5.7 nm and 4.24 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 31.2 nm, with the respective on/off ratios of 104 and 1. This thickness dependence is ascribed to the charge-impurity scattering effects. A photoanode was fabricated by depositing the liquid-exfoliated GeP nanosheets onto n-Si NW arrays. The resultant Si-GeP core–shell structures enhance the performance of water-splitting PEC cells under AM1.5 irradiation. Based on the band offset (estimated from the band structure calculated using HSE06 and charge neutrality conditions), the I–V curve of the PEC cell can be explained by the effective formation of a p-GeP/n-Si heterojunction in the SCR at the interface, which induces an upward band bending for n-Si at its interface with the electrolyte. The present work can stimulate further research on new 2D semiconducting materials with a wide band gap for use in photoelectronic devices.
