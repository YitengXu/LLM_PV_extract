    , Accepted 13th May 2015First published on 13th May 2015AbstractTwo new alkoxylphenyl substituted thieno[2,3-f]benzofuran (TBFP)-based polymers (PTBFP–BT and PTBFP–BO) were designed and synthesized. Their structures were verified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the molecular weights were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and the thermal properties were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The two polymers showed similar UV-Vis absorption spectra with a broad and strong absorption band from 300–750 nm in solid state. The resulting copolymers exhibited relatively deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels (−5.47 and −5.61 eV) for PTBFP–BT and PTBFP–BO, respectively. The device fabricated with PTBFP–BT:PC71BM (1:2) showed better balanced hole and electron mobility of 2.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, than those of PTBFP–BO based devices. The polymer solar cells (PSCs), based on the single layer device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTBFP–BT:PC71BM (1:2, w/w)/ZrAcac/Al with 3 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as additive, showed a relatively high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6% under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, with a high fill factor (FF) of 0.69.
Introduction
Over the past several decades, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs), prepared using conjugated polymers as donor and fullerene derivatives (e.g., [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyricacid methyl ester (PC71BM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyricacid methyl ester (PC61BM)) as acceptor have been extensively investigated due to their attractive advantages for fabricating light-weight, low-cost, large-area and flexible devices through roll-to-roll solution processes.1–4 The innovation of material design and the optimization of device have led to tremendous improvements in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), which have rapidly increased from below 1% in the 1990s to >10% for single junction cells and >11% for tandem cells.5–9 Although the present results are fairly satisfactory, it is still necessary to search for ideal conjugated polymers combining high PCE with convenient processability and to delve into the relationship between structure and properties.10–14
Benzodichalcogenophene (BDC) derivatives have lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and stronger absorption than alkoxy-substituting units, which are beneficial for obtaining high open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current (Jsc), two-dimensional (2D) structures, in particular 2D-conjugated benzodifuran (BDF) and benzodithiophene (BDT). They have been widely used in BHJ PSCs and deeply studied by many groups.15–19 In recent years, Hou and coworkers have designed a series of BDT-based polymers to investigate photovoltaic effects of the various 2D-conjugated structures.6,20–24 Our group has also synthesized several 2D-conjugated BDT and BDF-based polymers and some of them have shown desirable performance.25–27 On the contrary, the non-symmetric structure of BDC derivatives, thieno[2,3-f]benzofuran (TBF), as a structural hybrid of BDF and BDT has not been widely used and explored in PSCs.28 Our group has recently reported a 2D-conjugated TBF-based polymer named PTBFTDTBT, which has reached an acceptable PCE of 6.4% without any device modifications or post-treatment.29 In addition to material engineering, PSCs' performance is also critically dependent on the morphology and the interfaces. In order to gain insight into the relationship between the active layer morphology and the device performance, a broad range of techniques have been applied to probe the formation and evolution of morphology of blend films.30–32 Solvent treatment, additive and thermal annealing have been recognized as effective methods and have played important roles in obtaining desirable morphology to gain superior performance and promote development of BHJ PSCs.33–36 In addition, the reformation of interface layers (e.g., cathode buffer layer (CBL), hole transporting layer (HTL) and electron transporting layer (ETL)) is also required to realize commercial applications of PSCs.37–43
Taking into account all the reasons discussed above, to investigate the more in-depth TBF unit and the different mixing behaviors, we designed and synthesized two new 2D-conjugated TBF-based polymers, named PTBFP–BT and PTBFP–BO, obtained from alkoxyphenyl-substituted TBF unit and 4,7-di(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-dioctyloxybenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) and 4,7-di(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-dioctyloxybenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole (BO).25–27,44,45 The two low band-gap polymers possessed good solubility in common organic solvents and both of them showed broad absorption in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 700 nm in CHCl3 solution. The blend of PTBFP–BT and PC71BM showed better balanced hole and electron mobility of 2.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, than those of the blend of PTBFP–BO and PC71BM, which is consistent with the higher fill factor (FF) and Jsc. The PSCs based on PTBFP–BT delivered a satisfying PCE of 6% with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca or ZrAcac/Al.
Experimental section
Materials
Furan-3-carboxylic acid, thiophene-3-carboxaldehyde, n-BuLi, Pd(PPh3)4, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and Sn(CH3)3Cl were obtained from J&K and Alfa Asia Chemical Co., and they were used as received. Toluene was dried over Na/benzophenone and freshly distilled prior to use. All other reagents and solvents were purchased commercially as ACS-grade quality and used without further purification. Thieno[2,3-f]benzofuran-4,8-dione (2), 4,7-di(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-dioctyloxybenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (M2) and 4,7-di(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-dioctyloxybenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole (M3) were prepared according to the literature procedures.28,46
Measurements and instrumentation

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using Bruker DMX-400 and DMX-500 spectrometers in CDCl3 at 293 K, respectively. Chemical shifts were reported in units of parts per million, with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard (δ 0.00 ppm). The number-average (Mn) and weight-average (Mw) of the polymer were measured by the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) method using a Waters 150C, wherein polystyrene was used as a standard using THF as an eluent. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a PE TGA-7 at a heating rate of 20 K min−1 in a nitrogen atmosphere. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Hitachi U-2450 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. For solid state measurements, polymer solution in chloroform was cast on quartz plates. The cyclic voltammetric (CV) experiments were conducted using a Zahner IM6e electrochemical workstation, to investigate the redox behavior of polymers and determine their HOMO and lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. CV was carried out under an argon atmosphere at room temperature in an anhydrous and argon-saturated solution of 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. A platinum disk covered by the polymer film, Pt wire and a Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to investigate the crystallinity of the spin-coated polymer/PC71BM blend films prepared on silicon substrates. XRD measurements of the thin films were carried out with a 2 kW Rigaku X-ray diffraction system. The morphologies of the polymer/PC71BM blend films were obtained using a Veeco Dimension V atomic force microscopic (AFM) in the tapping mode.
Fabrication and characterization of the polymer solar cells
The PSCs were fabricated in the configuration of the traditional sandwich structure with an indium tin oxide (ITO) glass positive electrode and a metal negative electrode. Patterned ITO glass with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq−1 was purchased from CSG Holding Co. Ltd (China). The ITO glass was cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol and then treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Ultraviolet Ozone Cleaner, Jelight Company, USA) for 20 min. PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)) (Baytron P 4083, Germany) was filtered through a 0.45 mm filter and spin coated at 3000 rpm for 40 s on the ITO electrode. Subsequently, the PEDOT:PSS film was baked at 150 °C for 20 min in air to give a thin film with a thickness of ∼30 nm. A blend of the polymer and PC71BM was dissolved in ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) and spin-cast at 2000 rpm for 90 s onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The thickness of the photoactive layer was in the range of 70–100 nm, measured using an Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer. The zirconium acetylacetonate (ZrAcac) cathode buffer layer was prepared by directly spin-coating the ZrAcac ethanol solution on the photoactive layer, without any additional thermal annealing or post-treatment.47 Finally, the metal cathode (Al or Ca/Al) was thermally evaporated under a shadow mask with a base pressure of ca. 10−5 Pa. The photoactive area of the device is 5 mm2. Device characterization was carried out under AM 1.5G irradiation with the intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel 67005, 500 W), calibrated by a standard silicon cell. J–V curves were recorded with a Keithley 236 digital source meter.
Synthesis of the monomer and polymers
The synthesis routes of the monomer and polymers are shown in Scheme 1. The detailed synthesis procedures are as follows.

N,N-Diethylfuran-3-carboxamide 1. 
Furan-3-carboxylic acid (25.1 g, 0.224 mol) and thionyl chloride (SOCl2) (65.3 mL, 0.9 mol) were put into a dry three-necked round bottomed flask. The mixture was stirred at 70 °C for 4 h. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, the redundant thionyl chloride was removed under vacuum to give the reaction intermediate, furan-3-carbonyl chloride, as brown oil, which was used for the next step without further purification. The intermediate was added dropwise into a solution of diethylamine (92.6 mL) and dichloromethane (100 mL) in a three-necked round-bottomed flask at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was warmed up to room temperature and stirred for 1 h. Then the reaction mixture was poured into 100 mL of ice water and the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate. After the solvents were evaporated under vacuum, the crude product was subjected to silica column chromatography using petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (1/2, v/v) as eluent to give compound 1 as light yellow oil (33.68 g, yield: 90%).

After the solution was cooled to −78 °C, n-BuLi (21.87 mL, 52.5 mmol) was added dropwise within 5 min. The reaction mixture was stirred for 15 min, and then a solution of freshly distilled thiophene-3-carboxaldehyde (5.88 g, 52.5 mmol) in THF (75 mL) was added dropwise within 15 min.

Under argon, 1-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzene (7.87 g, 27.6 mmol) was added dropwise to magnesium turnings (0.797 g, 33.2 mmol) in anhydrous THF (35 mL) with a catalytic amount of I2 (∼10 mg). The solution was refluxed for 5 h until the magnesium was consumed. The reflux was continued for one more hour, and then the solution was cooled to room temperature. The solution was added slowly to thieno[2,3-f]benzofuran-4,8-dione (1.224 g, 6 mmol) in 10 mL THF. After the mixture was refluxed at 50 °C for an hour, a solution of SnCl2·2H2O (8.68 g) in 10% aqueous HCl (12.1 mL) was then added dropwise into the abovementioned reaction mixture. The solution was stirred for another 1 h at 50 °C. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, the mixture was poured into water and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic extraction was washed successively with water and sodium bicarbonate solution twice. The combined organic phase was dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to afford the crude product. The crude product was subjected to silica column chromatography using pure hexane as eluent to give a white solid (1.05 g, yield: 30%).

A solution of compound 3 (0.773 g, 1.33 mmol) in dry THF (40 mL) was deoxygenated with nitrogen for 30 min, and then n-BuLi (1.94 mL, 2.4 mol L−1) was added dropwise at −78 °C. After the solution was allowed to warm up to 50 °C for 1 h, 1.0 M trimethyltin chloride solution in THF (5.32 mL, 1 mol L−1) was added at room temperature. The reaction proceeded overnight. Then, the mixture was poured into water and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase was evaporated and the residue was recrystallized from 20 mL acetone to afford the pale yellow solid (0.93 g, yield: 77%).

Synthesis of PTBFP–BT
A solution of M1 (0.136 g, 0.15 mmol), M2 (0.107 g, 0.15 mmol) in dry toluene (12 mL) was put into a two-necked flask. The solution was flushed with Ar for 20 min and Pd(PPh3)4 (15 mg) was added into the flask. The solution was flushed with Ar again for 20 min. The oil bath was carefully heated to 110 °C and the reactant was stirred for 24 h at this temperature under an argon atmosphere. After the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, the mixture was poured into methanol (150 mL) slowly, allowing the crude polymer to precipitate. After filtration, the crude product was subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane and chloroform in sequence. The chloroform fraction was evaporated to dryness and further dried in a vacuum for 1 day to get the final product as a blue black solid (157 mg, yield: 89%).
Synthesis of PTBFP–BO
PTBFP–BO was obtained by a similar procedure with the synthesis of PTBFP–BT starting from M1 (0.136 g, 0.15 mmol) and M3 (0.103 g, 0.15 mmol). Finally, the blue black solid was obtained (70 mg, yield: 41%).
Results and discussion
Polymerization results
On the basis of the D–A concept, two low band-gap polymers, PTBFP–BT and PTBFP–BO, were synthesized from the medium electron-donating 2D TBF unit with strong electron-accepting BT and BO units, using a typical stille coupling polymerization reaction. The two polymers were purified by continuous extractions with methanol, hexanes and chloroform, and the chloroform fraction was recovered. Polymers were characterized by NMR, as shown in ESI.† GPC results (using polystyrene as the standard and THF as the eluent) have shown that Mn of PTBFP–BT and PTBFP–BO are 45 kDa and 13 kDa, with polydispersity indices (PDI) of 1.67 and 1.95, respectively. The GPC data of the copolymers are shown in Table 1.

Thermal stability
Thermal stabilities of the polymers were investigated by TGA in an inert atmosphere. Fig. 1 displays the TGA thermogram of PTBFP–BT and PTBFP–BO. The thermal data of the copolymers are also summarized in Table 1. The TGA results reveal that the two polymers possess desirable and similar thermal stabilities. The onset points of the 5% weight loss (Td) of the two polymers are both ca. 310 °C, which are similar to alkoxyphenyl-substituted BDT-based polymer PBDTPODTBT and PBDTPODTBO.25

Optical properties
The absorption spectra for PTBFP–BT and PTBFP–BO in CHCl3 solution and thin film are shown in Fig. 2 at room temperature, and the corresponding optical parameters are collected in Table 2 for comparison. The two polymers exhibit similar profiles both in solution and solid state. In solution, the two polymers show two evident broad absorption bands with high energy absorption from 300 nm to 500 nm and low energy absorption from 500 nm to 700 nm. Compared to their absorption in solution, the maximum absorption peaks of the two polymer films show evident redshifts of 93 nm and 89 nm for PTBFP–BT and PTBFP–BO, respectively, indicating that the polymer chains have stronger intermolecular interactions in the film state than in solution. This is because the polymer chains adopt a planar geometry and pack closely in the solid state. The edges of the absorption band for PTBFP–BT and PTBFP–BO in solid state are 754 nm and 738 nm, respectively. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) estimated from the UV-Vis absorption onsets in solid state are determined to be 1.65 eV for PTBFP–BT and 1.68 eV for PTBFP–BO.

Electrochemical properties
CV measurements were carried out to determine HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers. As shown in Fig. 3, the oxidation onset potentials of PTBFP–BT and PTBFP–BO are 1.07 V and 1.21 V, respectively. The reduction onset potentials of PTBFP–BT and PTBFP–BO are −0.85 V and −0.75 V, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers could be calculated according to the following equations: HOMO = −e(Eoxon + 4.4) (eV) and LUMO = −e(Eredon + 4.4) (eV), where the unit of Eoxon and Eredon is in V vs. Ag/AgCl. The HOMO and LUMO levels of PTBFP–BT and PTBFP–BO are −5.47 eV/−3.55 eV and −5.61 eV/−3.65 eV, respectively. From the CV curves, the energy levels of the copolymers could be tuned by altering the electron withdrawing units. Due to the deeper HOMO of BO unit caused by the higher electronegativity of oxygen atom compared to sulfur atom of BT unit (O, 3.5; S, 2.5), PTBFP–BO has the deeper HOMO level, which could ensure good air stability and a high Voc in the PSCs. According to Bittner and co-workers, the band offset determined by the LUMO of polymer and the LUMO of PCBM must be greater than the exciton binding energy.48 The energy offsets between the two polymers and PC71BM were large enough to offer a driving force for charge separation and transfer.49–51 The electrochemical band gaps, estimated from the difference between the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, were 1.92 eV and 1.96 eV for PTBFP–BT and PTBFP–BO, respectively. The electrochemical band gaps were slightly larger (∼0.3 eV) than the optical band gaps. This discrepancy might be induced by the presence of an energy barrier at the interface between the polymer film and the electrode surface.

Charge transport
In addition to the absorption and energy levels, the charge transport abilities of conjugated polymers also have a great effect on the resulting performance, especially on Jsc and FF of BHJ solar cells.52 In order to quantify charge mobility, hole-only device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM (1:2)/Au) and electron-only device (Al/polymer:PC71BM (1:2)/Al) were prepared using optimized BHJ films and their J–V characteristics were analyzed by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The hole and electron mobilities are calculated by Poole–Frenkel Law.45 The SCLC is described by (1) The results are plotted as (Jd3/V2) vs. (V/d)0.5, as shown in Fig. 4. Here, J stands for current density, d is the thickness of the device, V = Vappl − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied potential and Vbi is the built-in potential. According to eqn (1), the PTBFP–BO:PC71BM-based device presented hole and electron mobility of 4.55 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The device fabricated with PTBFP–BT:PC71BM showed better balanced hole and electron mobility of 2.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was consistent with the higher FF and Jsc of PTBFP–BT based devices (Table 3). The electron mobility of polymers:PC71BM was quite comparable, which may be due to the fact that the electron mobility is mainly determined by the n-type PC71BM in these BHJ films. The discrepancy of hole mobility of the two polymers (about two orders of magnitude) is mainly due to the different mixing behavior of PCBM in BT and BO based polymers and different structures of two polymers.44 Moreover, the higher hole mobility of PTBFP–BT tended to obtain higher Jsc and FF.

Photovoltaic properties
The general bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:PC71BM/Ca or ZrAcac/Al to investigate the photovoltaic properties of the two different polymers. Fig. 5a shows the typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 and the corresponding device performance including Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE is also summarized in Table 3. As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), an optimal donor/acceptor weight ratio was obtained as 1:2 for both PTBFP–BT and PTBFP–BO based devices. The device for PTBFP–BT, without any treatment, shows a moderate PCE of 5.58% with a Voc of 0.75 V, a Jsc of 12.44 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.60. The higher FF of the devices based on PTBFP–BT is consistent with the better balanced hole and electron mobility. Although the molecular weights of the two polymers were different (Table 1), the absorption coefficients of polymer:PC71BM (1:2) blends were similar (Fig. S10, ESI†). Therefore, the higher Jsc is mainly due to the higher hole mobility from the PTBFP–BT/PC71BM blend.44 As shown in Fig. 5a, after the doping of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) with 3% volume fraction, the PTBFP–BT based device possesses a preferable PCE of 6% with a Voc of 0.71 V, a Jsc of 12.57 mA cm−2 and a high FF up to 0.67. When replacing the Ca layer with ZrAcac as the cathode buffer layer, a promising FF of 0.69 is obtained but with the same PCE, which is due to the slight reduction of Voc. The higher Voc of PTBFP–BO based devices is mainly due to the relatively deeper HOMO level of PTBFP–BO. Despite the higher Voc, PTBFP–BO shows moderate PCEs ranging from 3.5–4.5% under different conditions from lower Jsc and FF.
 Fig. 5  (a) Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and (b) external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PTBFP–BT and PTBFP–BO based solar cells. 
EQE curves of devices based on the two polymers are shown in Fig. 5b. The BHJ solar cells exhibit a spectral response from 300 nm to 700 nm with a broad and flat peak around 60–70% at approximately 370–620 nm and 40–50% at approximately 350–650 nm for PTBFP–BT and PTBFP–BO, respectively. The different EQE photoresponses of the two polymers could be ascribed to the different situations of phase separation, charge transport and absorption characteristics. The integral current density values deduced from the EQE curves and the standard solar spectrum (AM 1.5G) agree well with those obtained from the J–V measurement.
Morphology

Fig. 6 shows the surface morphologies and phase images obtained by the AFM method. From the height images, the surface of the polymer:PC71BM (1:2) layer is relatively smooth, with a RMS of about 0.89 nm and 0.63 nm in an area of (3 μm × 3 μm) for PTBFP–BT and PTBFP–BO, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6a and e. As an effective additive, DIO has previously been used to help optimize the polymer/PCBM blend morphology.53 As shown in Fig. 6c and g, the use of DIO resulted in some changes in surface topography. Films cast from solutions of polymer and PC71BM containing 3% (v/v) DIO became a little smoother for both polymers compared to the film without DIO.

Root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values are given to describe the smoothness of the morphology. 
From the phase images in Fig. 6f, the aggregation size of the PTBFP–BO:PC71BM blend without DIO is too big to get efficient EQE. For BHJ PSCs, it is well known that the phase separation must be sufficiently large to create pathways for charge carrier transport, yet small enough to form a large interfacial area for efficient exciton dissociation and charge separation.24 As shown in Fig. 6d, the blend of PTBFP–BT:PC71BM with DIO as additive show better phase separation with moderate aggregation size, which is consistent with higher EQE. The results show that the polymer with BO as the acceptor unit will induce relatively strong aggregations in the blend, whereas the polymer with BT as the acceptor unit shows better compatibility with PC71BM, indicating the different mixing behaviors of PTBFP–BT:PC71BM and PTBFP–BO:PC71BM.
Conclusion
In summary, two new polymers PTBFP–BT and PTBFP–BO with alkoxyphenyl-substituted TBF as the donor unit have been designed and synthesized by Stille coupling polymerization reaction and used as the donor in PSCs. Both polymers showed a wide absorption band from 300 nm to around 750 nm in the visible light region in solid state, with a low optical band gap of 1.65 eV and 1.68 eV, respectively. The electrochemical band gap is 1.92 eV for PTBFP–BT and 1.96 eV for PTBFP–BO. Moreover, compared to the blend of PTBFP–BO and PC71BM, the blend of PTBFP–BT and PC71BM showed better balanced hole and electron mobility of 2.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, by SCLC method. Higher hole mobility and better morphology led to higher Jsc and FF. The PSCs based on PTBFP–BT:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) exhibited a promising PCE of 6% with a Voc of 0.71 V, a Jsc of 12.57 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 0.69. These results indicate that 2D-conjugated TBF unit may be a promising building block for high-efficiency polymer solar cells.
