    , Accepted 11th April 2014First published on 11th April 2014AbstractWe report on a novel core–shell TiO2/CdSe nanofiber photoanode for photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation. The core–shell nanofiber films, with a hierarchical network structure, are prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide coated substrates via electrospinning pyrolysis and chemical bath deposition. The hierarchical network structure shows significantly improved photoelectrochemical properties due, we believe, to possessing more active sites for the oxidation reaction and a larger TiO2/CdSe interface area for photogenerated charges’ separation. The synthesis details are discussed to provide a generic route for preparing other similar photoanodes with hierarchical network structures.
Introduction
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen generation process is considered to be one of the most promising techniques to meet the world’s energy shortage needs.1 Numerous research works demonstrate that the structure of the photoanode has an important influence on the energy conversion efficiency.2 Therefore, semiconductors with various nanostructures such as nanoparticles, nanoplates, nanorods, and nanotubes have been designed as the photoanodes to promote energy conversion efficiency for hydrogen generation.3–9 Among them, one-dimensional structures are attracting more and more attention due to their superior charge transport properties, few grain boundaries, and the quick ion diffusion at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface.8,10
As one of these one-dimensional structures, ceramic nanofibers play a vital role in various applications such as dye-sensitized solar cells,11 fuel cells,12 photodetectors,13 and in hydrogen storage.14 For PEC hydrogen generation, ceramic nanofibers can be used as an ideal framework and charge transport channel for the catalyst in the photoanode because of features and properties such as their one-dimensional morphology, high surface area, and hierarchical structure.15,16 Nanofibers, however, have seldom been investigated for PEC applications due to the limited preparation technology.
Finding a generic route for preparing nanofiber-based photoanode structures is very significant for further promoting photoconversion efficiency in PEC applications. Li et al. first reported a procedure based on electrospinning for generating ceramic nanofibers.17 Uniform TiO2 nanofibers with a network structure were successfully fabricated in their work. Subsequently, Chuangchote et al. tested the photocatalyst properties of TiO2 nanofibers, which were prepared based on electrospinning as well.18 After being calcined at 450 °C, the TiO2 nanofibers showed higher activity than reference commercial TiO2 nanoparticles. It is generally known that the PEC hydrogen generation system has a similar principle with particulate photocatalyst suspension systems.2 Thus, utilizing electrospinning to prepare a TiO2 photoanode with a network structure may achieve considerable PEC performance.
Except for the structure, it is also vital to select the appropriate material. Although many semiconductors show PEC activity, preparing a photoanode with single material could hardly solve the issues of a high charge carrier recombination rate and poor absorption of visible light.19 Using narrow band gap semiconductors such as CdS,20–22 CdSe,23–26 and CdTe27 to sensitize the wide band gap semiconductor has proved to be an effective approach to extend optical absorption ability and hence enhance the PEC performance. Among those narrow band gap semiconductors, CdSe could absorb most of the visible light, and the energy bands of it match TiO2 very well.23–26,28–30
In this study, TiO2/CdSe core–shell nanofiber films with a hierarchical network structure are prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide coated substrates via electrospinning pyrolysis and chemical bath deposition (CBD). As one of the most extensively studied materials in PEC applications,9,31 TiO2 was select as the framework and charge transport channel for the photoanode. CdSe, as a narrow band gap energy semiconductor, was used to extend the light absorption range. The stepwise band-edge structure within the interface between TiO2 and CdSe can promote the electron–cavity separation efficiency.23–25,32 PEC measurements indicated that the illustrative photoanodes show pretty good photoconversion efficiency.
Experimental
Fabrication of TiO2/CdSe nanofiber films
TiO2/CdSe nanofiber films were prepared by electrospinning pyrolysis and a CBD approach which are shown in Fig. 1. The TiO2 nanofiber film was first deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates via electrospinning pyrolysis. Before deposition, the substrates were ultrasonically pre-cleaned in acetone, de-ionized water, and ethanol for 30 minutes respectively, and then dried with a stream of nitrogen. The spray solution was prepared by dissolving 0.15 g PVP (K90, Mw ≈ 1300000), 1.25 mmol tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT), and 0.125 mmol acetylacetone in 5 ml ethanol. After being magnetically stirred for 6 hours, the as-prepared spray solution was pumped to the tip of a stainless steel needle (27 Gauge) by a syringe pump. The distance between the substrate and the tip of the needle was adjusted to 5 cm. The temperature of the electric heating plate was slowly raised to 350 °C. During electrospinning pyrolysis, the flow rate was maintained at 0.5 ml per hour. The high direct current (DC) voltage was set at 5 kV, and the nozzle maintained reciprocating scanning. Subsequently, the as-prepared PVP/TBOT nanofiber film was calcined at 500 °C for 3 hours to improve the sample crystallinity and remove organic residues in a muffle furnace.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the fabrication strategy for TiO2/CdSe nanofiber films. 
CdSe particles were deposited on the surfaces of TiO2 nanofibers by a CBD approach. Firstly, 0.02 mol of selenium powder was added into 100 mL of Na2SO3 aqueous solution (0.5 mol L−1). Then this solution was maintained at 70 °C for 5 hours under a nitrogen purge gas to achieve the fresh Na2SeSO3 solution. The Na2SeSO3 solution was used as the Se source for depositing CdSe particles during CBD. The CdSe precursor solution was prepared by dissolving KOH (0.505 g), nitrilotriacetic acid (0.57 g), Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.617 g), and Na2SeSO3 solution (10 mL) in 100 ml of de-ionized water. The prepared TiO2 nanofiber films were put into the above CdSe precursor solution and kept at a constant temperature of 70 °C for several hours. After the reaction, composite films were washed by de-ionized water and then dried with a stream of nitrogen for further tests.
Characterization
A JEOL JSM-7800F scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to characterize the morphology and structure of the films. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the phase and crystal structure of the films was performed using an X'pert PRO diffractometer (PANalytical, using Cu Kα irradiation (λ = 15.4184 nm)). Reflectance and transmittance spectra of the films were obtained using a double-beam UV4100 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer equipment.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
PEC measurements were carried out in a three-electrode system. The films were used as the work electrode and installed onto a self-made electrode holder with a surface area of 0.785 cm2. A platinum foil was used as the counter electrode. A saturated calomel electrode Ag/AgCl (silver and silver chloride) was used as the reference electrode. An aqueous solution of 0.5 M Na2SO3 was used as the electrolyte. Photocurrent densities were measured by a CHI 760D scanning potentiostat (CH Instruments). The scanning rate was 10 mV s−1, and the scanning direction was from low to high potential. A 500 W xenon lamp coupled with an AM1.5 filter was used as the light source. The light intensity was set at 100 mW cm−2. The potential, against an Ag/AgCl reference, was converted to the RHE (reversible hydrogen potential) potential using the formula VRHE = VAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + 0.1976 V, where VRHE is a potential versus a reversible hydrogen potential, VAg/AgCl is the potential versus Ag/AgCl electrode, and pH is the pH value of the electrolyte.33,34
Apart from the devices used in the photocurrent densities measurements, a Newport monochromator 74126 and a quartz convex lens was used during the IPCE measurement. The absolute intensity of the incident light was measured using a radiometer/photometer Model IL1400BL from International Light. Moreover, the PEC stability was measured in a sealed PEC cell with the surface area of 3.14 cm2. The current–time curve and H2 evolution plot can be obtained at the same time. The light source was as same as that used for the the photocurrent densities measurements. The hydrogen evolved was detected using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) gas chromatograph, TDX-01 column, and Ar carrier gas.
Results and discussion
To obtain pure a TiO2 nanofiber, the PVP/TBOT nanofiber must be thoroughly decomposed after or during electrospinning. When a dispersive TiO2 nanofiber was needed only, the PVP/TBOT nanofiber was sprayed onto a substrate at normal temperature and then thoroughly decomposed after further calcination.17,18 If the PVP/TBOT nanofiber was sprayed onto an FTO substrate at normal temperature, the TiO2 nanofiber would fall off from the FTO because of the excessive shrinkage caused by decomposition. Thus, the use of a heated substrate was studied for fabricating the TiO2 nanofiber film. Fortunately, the proper substrate temperature of 350 °C was found from a series of contrast experiments. The PVP/TBOT nanofiber would be partially decomposed after ejection from the needle and before reaching the FTO substrate due to the high temperature of the FTO substrates. The partial decomposition significantly reduced the shrink rate during further calcination. A crystalline TiO2 nanofiber film was obtained after being calcined in air at 500 °C for 3 hours.

Fig. 2 presents the XRD pattern of the TiO2 nanofiber film after calcination. Except for the characteristic diffraction peaks of the FTO (standard card JCPDS 77-0448), some new peaks were found at 25.3°, 37.9°, and 48.0°. All new peaks were indexed to standard card JCPDS 84-1286, which corresponds to anatase-type TiO2. This result indicated that TiO2 nanofibers prepared in the present study have an anatase crystal structure and no any other secondary TiO2 phase exits.

The morphology of the TiO2 nanofiber film was measured using SEM (as shown in Fig. 3A). TiO2 nanofibers lay on the FTO substrate and had a hierarchical network structure. The diameters of the nanofibers were between 20 nm and 200 nm. The thickness of the film was about 2.2 μm. As observed from the high magnification images, the nanofibers present a poriferous surface which can enlarge the specific surface area greatly. The crossing points (as shown in the white circle and insets of Fig. 3A) of the nanofibers developed together to form tight junctions. These tight junctions and nanofibers can form the transmission routes for charge carriers in the PEC reaction. The TEM image, shown in Fig. 3B, indicates that the TiO2 nanofibers were made by scores of nanoparticles around a few tens of nanometers in diameter. These unique properties such as network structure, poriferous surface (large specific surface area), and tight junctions of the crossing points mean this TiO2 nanofiber film can be used as an ideal frame substrate to couple with other narrow band gap catalysts.

CdSe was selected as the visible light absorber to extend the light absorption range and promote the efficiency of the electron-cavity separation. The size and the loading amount which seriously affect the light absorption and charge carrier transfer can be controlled by the deposition time.30 Therefore, different deposition times were studied here to find the top-performing TiO2/CdSe nanofiber film and reveal the PEC properties of the photoanode with a hierarchical network structure. The deposition time was set at 1, 2, 3, and 5 hours respectively. The films with different CBD were described as 1 h, 2 h, 3 h and 5 h.

Fig. 4A introduces XRD patterns of TiO2/CdSe nanofiber films with different deposition times. The block peaks at 2 theta of 42.1° and 49.7° can be indexed to the (220), (311) crystal planes of cubic CdSe in standard card JCPDS 19-0191. However, the peaks of cubic CdSe (111) and anatase TiO2 (101) surfaces overlapped at around 25.3°. It can be observed in Fig. 4B that this coupling peak broadens and shifts slightly to a higher angle as the deposition time increased. This indicates the transformation of peaks from anatase (101) to cubic (111) surfaces. From these analysis results of the XRD, it can be identified that CdSe was deposited on the films successfully. The ever-increasing intensities of cubic CdSe peaks reveal the amount of CdSe increased as the deposition time increased.

In general, it is straightforward and useful to characterize the optical properties of a film by calculating its absorbance as 1 − transmittance − reflectance after measuring its spectral reflectance and transmittance.35,36 The absorbance spectra of the films are displayed in Fig. 5A. Relative to TiO2, the absorption regions of the composite samples obviously extended into the visible light region. The absorbance of the composite films increased as the deposition time increased. After deposition for 5 hours, the composite film could absorb light within the absorption edge sufficiently (more than 90 percent on average). This indicated that there is no need for a longer time of deposition. Moreover, it is evident from Fig. 5A that the absorption edges of the composite films changed with the deposition time which indicated a band gap energy change of CdSe.30 The optical band gap can be extracted from transmittance and reflectance spectra by using the Tauc plot method in the equation30,37,38 αhv ∝ C(hv − Eg)n(1)where α is the absorption coefficient, C is the photon energy dependent constant, hv is the photon energy, and Eg is the band gap energy. Exponent n takes the values 1/2 for direct optical transitions and 2 for indirect optical transitions. In addition, the absorption coefficient α can be expressed by the equation39 αd = ln(T/(1 − R)2)(2)where d, T and R represent the thickness, transmittance, and reflectance of the films respectively. Exponent n takes value 1/2 because numerous works and theoretical calculations suggest that cubic CdSe is a direct optical transition material.40Fig. 5B shows the (αhv)2versus photon energy plot. However, all of the band gaps achieved here were larger than that of bulk CdSe, which is 1.7 eV on account of the quantum confinement effect.29 Furthermore, the optical band gaps of CdSe gradually decrease from 2.04 eV to 1.87 eV as the deposition time increased, except for a nuance between 2 hours and 3 hours deposition time. This diminution of band gaps suggests the size of CdSe might increase as the deposition time increased.29,30

Fig. 6 shows the SEM images of the composite nanofiber films. After 1 hour of deposition time, TiO2 nanofibers were studded with CdSe nanoparticles uniformly, and the diameters of the CdSe nanoparticles were in the range of dozens of nanometers (according to the 1 h image in Fig. 6). As evident from the 2 h image in Fig. 6 the TiO2 nanofibers were completely enwrapped uniformly by CdSe nanoparticles. Besides, the inset TEM image in Fig. 6 verified that CdSe nanoparticles connected closely and tightly to the TiO2 nanofiber, and the core–shell nanofiber structure was obtained. However, when the deposition time was increased to more than 3 hours, CdSe nanoparticles grew to big disordered microspheres (displayed in 3 h and 5 h of Fig. 6). Meanwhile, the gaps between the nanofibers were notably diminished by the CdSe particles.

The cross-sectional views of the composite films are displayed in Fig. 7. When the deposition time was 1 or 2 hours, the CdSe nanoparticles were uniformly deposited in the vertical direction on the FTO plane (displayed in the 1 h and 2 h images of Fig. 7). This uniform deposition also demonstrates that the nanofibers in the inner layer can directly react with an aqueous solution like the outer layer. From this, we can infer that not only the outer layer of the nanofibers network but also the inner layer can be involved directly in the PEC reaction. However, the long time of deposition would result in a non-uniform growth of CdSe in the vertical direction (as indicated in the 3 h and 5 h images of Fig. 7). A possible explanation is that the diminished gaps between the nanofibers in the outer layer (displayed in Fig. 6) held back the reactants permeating through the nanofiber layers. Thus, we can also infer that for the films with a long deposition time, the reaction between the electrolyte and the catalyst in the inner layer would be limited by a lack of a timely replenishment of the electrolyte in the PEC reaction.

By comparing the above analyses of structure, optical absorption abilities, and morphology, it can be conjectured that although a long deposition time promoted light absorption, it also extended the transmission distance of charge carriers and hindered the reaction between the electrolyte and catalysis in the inner layer. There must be an appropriate deposition time to achieve the best PEC performance. Fig. 8 compares the PEC performance of TiO2 and TiO2/CdSe nanofiber films. All the composite films exhibited obvious enhancement of photocurrent densities compared to the TiO2 nanofiber film and reached saturation at a potential above 0.566 V versus RHE. When the deposition time was 2 hours, the highest saturated photocurrent density value was achieved at 4.22 mA cm−2 with the applied potential of 0.566 V versus RHE. The highest saturated photocurrent density is almost 16 times more than that of the TiO2 nanofiber film. Moreover, the photocurrent densities of films deposited for more than 2 hours (3 hours and 5 hours) show a serious decrease. This result provides evidence of the above surmise, and the optimum deposition time is 2 hours.

In order to describe the mechanism of electrode reaction better, the sketch of the nanostructure and charge-transfer processes for the TiO2/CdSe nanofiber film is displayed in Fig. 9. The hierarchical network structure makes the TiO2 nanofiber can absorb more CdSe nanoparticles than structures based on a nanoparticle, nanorod, or nanotube. The poriferous surface of the TiO2 nanofiber (as shown in Fig. 3) obviously extended the area of the interface between anatase TiO2 and cubic CdSe. A stepwise band-edge structure was built within such an interface and could promote the electron–cavity separation efficiency.23–25,32 The electrons excited by light transfer travelled through the nanofibers and the crossing points in a roundabout way to reach FTO. When the deposition time was 2 hours, the procedure of CBD deposition revealed that all surfaces of the core–shell nanofiber can be involved directly in the PEC reaction and provide plenty of active sites for the oxidation reaction. When increasing the deposition time to over 2 hours, although the light absorption increased (as shown in Fig. 5), the long charge transmission distance and small gaps between nanofibers (as shown in Fig. 6) were the greater impacts that attenuated the photocurrent density.

The photocurrent density performance of all the films was also tested under monochromatic light and visible light illumination for further research on the PEC response to the light at various wavelengths. Comparing with the photocurrent under white light, the IPCE can better characterize the PEC performance because it has no connection with the light source in the measurement.41 IPCEλ is the IPCE corresponding to the wavelength of the incident light is λ and can be calculated by the following equation42 IPCEλ = (hc/e)(Iph,λ/λPλ)(3)where h is the Plank's constant, c is the speed of light in vacuum, e is the elementary charge, Iph,λ represents the photocurrent density, and Pλ is the power intensity of the incident monochromatic light. The IPCE plot is presented in Fig. 10A. Measurements were conducted in an aqueous 0.5 M Na2SO3 solution at an applied potential of 0.766 V versus RHE. After deposition for 1 and 2 hours, the increased IPCE in UV range demonstrates the enhanced separation and transportation of photoexcited charge carriers. This enhancement was attributed to the stepwise band-edge structure in the interface between anatase TiO2 and cubic CdSe. However, the IPCE diminished after deposition for 3 and 5 hours due to the long charge transmission distance and small gaps between the nanofibers. It is generally known that the solar energy in the visible light range is much larger than that in UV range. Visible light must be the major contributor to photocurrent density for the composite films. The enhancement of IPCE in the visible light range was huge. The composite film with a deposition time of 2 hours exhibits the best IPCE performance and the average IPCE in the visible part was around 30% while the TiO2 film displayed almost no response to visible light.
 Fig. 10  (A) IPCE, and (B) visible light illuminated current–potential curves for TiO2 and TiO2/CdSe nanofiber films. 

Fig. 10B shows current–potential curves under visible light illumination. A long-wave (λ > 430 nm) pass filter was used to shield UV light. The highest photocurrent density was 3.16 mA cm−2 with an applied potential of 0.566 V versus RHE. Compared with the photocurrent density under white light, it can be seen that the electric energy coming from visible light region contributed almost three quarters of the energy coming from all regions, while the photocurrent density measured for the bare TiO2 film was negligible. These results are highly consistent with the IPCE analysis.
The photoconversion efficiency (εeff), which corresponds to solar energy to chemical energy conversion efficiency in the presence of an external applied potential Eapp, was also computed in this work and can be expressed as43–45 % εeff = [jp(E0rev − |Eapp|) × 100/(I0)](4)where jp is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), E0rev is the standard state-reversible potential of 1.23 V for the water-splitting reaction, I0 is the power density intensity of the incident light (mW cm−2), and |Eapp| is the absolute value of the applied potential Eapp which can be obtained as43–45 Eapp = Emeas − Eaoc(5)where Emeas is the electrode potential (versus RHE) at which jp was measured, and Eaoc is the electrode potential at open circuit condition under the same light illumination and in the same electrolyte solution at which jp was measured. Fig. 11 displays the photoconversion efficiency of all the films. The composite film with CdSe deposited for 2 hours gives the highest photoconversion efficiency value of 2.8% with an applied potential of 0.366 V versus RHE.

Some previous works have reported the fabrication of TiO2/CdSe photoanodes used in similar applications. Kongkanand et al. used different-sized CdSe quantum dots to couple with TiO2 nanoparticle or nanotube films.24 The maximum IPCE was 35% for particulate TiO2 and 45% for tubular TiO2 morphology. The CdSe/TiO2 nanotube film obtained the maximum power-conversion efficiency of nearly 1%. Afterwards, Bang and co-workers sensitized a rutile TiO2 nanorod array with CdSe and utilized this as a photoanode for solar cells.25 The maximum IPCE of the CdSe/TiO2 nanorod electrodes was nearly 25%. Moreover, Liang et al. in situ electrodeposited CdSe clusters on TiO2 nanotubes.26 The maximum photocurrent density was nearly 2 mA cm−2 with an applied potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl under visible light illumination (λ > 430 nm) in 1 M NaOH solution containing 1 M Na2S and 1 M S. Compared with nanoparticle,23,28 nanotube,24,26 and nanorod25 based photoanodes, the nanofiber based one in this work exhibits a better PEC performance.
Photocorrosion is regarded as the main reason for the poor stability of photoanodes, especially the metal sulfides and selenides.9 Although photocorrosion cannot be avoided, good results can still be achieved by weakening the photocorrosion. In this study, the sacrificial electrolyte (Na2SO3) was used to prevent photocorrosion of the core–shell TiO2/CdSe nanofiber structure. The PEC stability measurements were carried out in a sealed PEC cell. The current–time curve and H2 evolution plot can be obtained at the same time. The applied potential was set at 0.766 V vs. RHE. As illustrated in Fig. 12, the highest photocurrent density was achieved after half an hour of irradiation. The photocurrent density decreased about 5.2% per hour after 1 hour of irradiation. Besides the insert plot in Fig. 12 indicates that TiO2/CdSe nanofiber film shows the ability for PEC H2 production (61.78 μmol h−1).
 Fig. 12  Current–time curve at a 0.766 V vs. RHE for the TiO2/CdSe nanofiber film with 2 hours of deposition time. Inset shows the H2 evolution plot. 
In this PEC reaction system, electrons unite with H+ to obtain H2 from water, and holes unite with SO32− to obtain SO42−. Photocorrosion takes place only when the ions in solution are insufficient to cope with all the photogenerated holes.46 If there is no SO32− to capture holes, OH− was inadequate to cope with all the photogenerated holes on CdSe/electrolyte interface. Thus Se2− in the photoanode will probably react with the holes. For demonstrating this statement, additional PEC stability measurements were conducted in electrolytes of Na2SO4 (0.5 M), and H2SO4 (0.1 M). Fig. 13 shows current–time curves for the TiO2/CdSe nanofiber film with a chopped light source. Low photocurrent densities and poor stability were displayed in Na2SO4 and H2SO4 electrolytes compared with in Na2SO3. The low initial photocurrent densities may be attributed to the high valance band of CdSe which makes it harder for the holes to cope with OH− than SO42−. The incessant reaction between holes and Se2− seriously damaged the PEC stability of the photoanode. Using sacrificial electrolyte (Na2SO3), thereby, is a reasonable way to achieve better economic results.

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully fabricated one-dimensional TiO2/CdSe core–shell nanofiber films on fluorine-doped tin oxide coated substrates via electrospinning pyrolysis and chemical bath deposition. The film was based on a hierarchical network structure which was built by electrospinning pyrolysis. The poriferous surface of TiO2 nanofiber and hierarchical network structure enabled the composite film to absorb more CdSe nanoparticles and have larger TiO2/CdSe interface area than other structure-based films such as those based on nanoparticles, nanotubes, and nanorods. The procedure of CBD deposition revealed that all surfaces of the core–shell nanofiber can be involved directly in the PEC reaction and provide plenty of active sites for the oxidation reaction. Series PEC tests demonstrated the hierarchical network structure has the potential to improve PEC hydrogen generation efficiencies. PEC measurements of illustrative films show the highest photoconversion efficiency is 2.8% with a saturated photocurrent density of 4.22 mA cm−2 at an applied potential of 0.566 V versus RHE. The highest IPCE was around 30% corresponding to the highest photocurrent densities of 3.16 mA cm−2 under visible light illumination. The PEC stability measurements show that the TiO2/CdSe nanofiber film has the ability for PEC H2 production (61.78 μmol h−1). Although TiO2 was selected in the present work, electrospinning pyrolysis is a versatile route to prepare oxides like ZnO, Fe2O3, WO3, and SnO2. This work described here could be extended to provide a generic route for preparing other similar photoanodes with a hierarchical network structure for PEC applications.
