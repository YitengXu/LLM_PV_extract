    , Accepted 8th May 2013First published on 8th May 2013AbstractIt is not an exaggeration to say that successful development of any renewable energy source (e.g., windmills and solar cells), hybrid and electric vehicles, and smart grids depends significantly upon the availability of a suitable energy storage system. Electrochemical capacitors (ECs, also known as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors) are one of the electrochemical energy storage systems that can store and release energy at a pulse power. Commercial ECs based on activated carbon electrodes have a fairly low energy density, which is mainly due to the ill-defined physical and chemical properties of the activated carbon. Hence, the past decade has witnessed a rapid growth in the R&D of new carbon and carbon-based materials for ECs. Ideally, a carbon electrode should possess a high specific surface area (SSA) accessible to electrolyte ions, three-dimensional pores of appropriate sizes, good electrical conductivity, excellent stability against harsh environments (e.g., a wide range of temperatures, various electrolytes, and stress), flexibility, easy processability, compatibility with other materials (e.g., a current collector), and of course low cost. Integrating these features (and sometimes beyond) in one solid is one of the research frontiers. This feature article provides a brief review of advanced porous carbon materials with some or all of the above features that have been developed over the past few years.
1 Introduction
After General Electric patented a low voltage electrolytic capacitor in 1957,1 the Standard Oil of Ohio (SOHIO) Company filed a patent describing a device that stores energy by the electric double layer (EDL) mechanism in 1966.2 Later, NEC took over SOHIO and the development of electrochemical capacitors (ECs) progressed rapidly. In the 1980s, companies like Panasonic, ELNA, and PRI all commercialized ECs for memory backup and military uses.3,4 Today, there are a number of manufacturers producing ECs, such as AVX, Cap-XX, Maxwell, Honeywell, and NESSCAP to name just a few, and ECs are invading into many industries beyond their traditional applications.
An EC cell consists of two electrodes saturated with an electrolyte and separated by a dielectric porous membrane that allows migration of electrolyte ions while keeping the two electrodes electrically apart. According to the mechanism of how energy is stored, there are two types of ECs – one is electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and the other one is pseudo-capacitors. EDLCs store energy by forming an EDL of ions on the surface of both electrodes. When a potential is applied, the positive electrode (cathode) attracts negative ions while the negative electrode (anode) attracts positive ions, thus forming one capacitor in each electrode. Electrodes with high specific surface area (SSA) such as activated carbons (ACs) are suitable for EDLCs. In general, EDLCs can be operated at very high charge and discharge rates with a lifetime of over a million cycles.5 However, the energy stored in the EDLC is lower than that of batteries. For example, the energy density of an AC EDLC is less than 10 W h kg−1, lower than that of lead acid batteries (in the range of 20–35 W h kg−1) and lithium-ion batteries (in the range of 120–170 W h kg−1).6 As a result, recent research focus has been to increase the energy density of EDLCs.7 Pseudo-capacitors store energy due to fast and reversible redox reactions occurring on the surface of a pseudo-capacitive material, such as metal oxides and conducting polymers. The pseudo-capacitor has higher energy density than the EDLC, but poor cyclability.
In terms of electrode configuration, ECs can be fabricated as symmetric and asymmetric (or hybrid) cells as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. Fig. 1(a) schematically represents the configuration of a conventional EC cell with AC as both electrodes. The capacitance is mainly based on the EDL mechanism with a good cycling stability, a high power density, but a low specific capacitance and a low energy density. To enhance the capacitance of each electrode, a pseudo-capacitive material (e.g., conducting polymers) is very often added to the AC electrode as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). Such a symmetrically configured cell has both EDL capacitance and pseudo-capacitance. Fig. 1(c–e) show the illustration of asymmetric configurations, i.e. combinations of different types of electrodes, including battery-type electrodes. These asymmetric configurations feature a high energy density, a high power density and an increased operating voltage. Naoi et al.8 described an asymmetric EC with lithium titanate-carbon nanofiber (CNF) as the negative electrode and AC as the positive electrode. This hybrid capacitor exhibited an energy density as high as 40 W h L−1 and a high power density of 7.5 kW L−1. Although an improved performance can be achieved with asymmetric ECs, special considerations of capacity matching must be given for smart EC configurations.9–11

Another example of smart EC configuration was demonstrated by Chmiola et al.12 In this work, ECs were integrated on a chip to meet the demand for flexible design of devices. As schematically illustrated in Fig. 2, TiC was sputtered on the SiO2 surface of a silicon chip. After chlorination treatment, the top layer of the TiC was transformed into a carbide-derived carbon (CDC). A Au current collector was then introduced using the sputtering technique with any pre-designed pattern. After etching, a monolithic micro-supercapacitor electrode was obtained.

In addition to AC, carbon aerogels (CAs), CDCs, CNFs, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), expanded graphite (EG), graphene, chemically modified graphene (CMG), and template carbons (TCs) have been investigated for use as electrode materials for ECs. Recent research efforts have been, on one hand, focusing on increasing the SSA of carbon-based electrodes, and on the other hand, looking for an appropriate pore structure to match with an electrolyte for improving the performance of EDLCs. In addition, various functional groups,13–16 foreign atoms,17 metal oxides18,19 and electronically conducting polymers,20–22 have been investigated to increase the specific pseudo-capacitance.
This feature article attempts to summarize recent developments on new carbon-based electrode materials. With a brief analysis of the capacitance–property relationship, recently developed advanced porous carbon electrodes with desirable properties for improving the performance of ECs are discussed.
2 Capacitance–property relationship
Recent studies towards enhancing the energy density of ECs have revealed some controversial results about the charge storage mechanism and transport phenomena at the electrode–electrolyte interface, particularly in nanoporous carbon electrode materials. As highly porous electrode materials usually consist of nanopores and channels, the charge storage mechanism becomes complex and can differ greatly from what the traditional EDL model based on a planar surface predicts. Ion transport in nanoporous carbons can be influenced by a number of factors, such as the pore size, pore length, pore geometry, surface curvature, surface chemistry, and electrical conductivity of the carbon.
2.1 Pore size
It is traditionally believed that pores with diameters smaller than the size of hydrated electrolyte ions do not participate in the formation of EDL. However, Chmiola et al.23 observed an anomalous increase in capacitance on a CDC electrode with pore diameters less than the size of solvated ions of tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4) in aprotic solvent acetonitrile (ACN). Largeot et al.24 recently used a solvent-free ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoro-methylsulfonyl)imide ([emim][Tf2N]) to study the effect of CDC pore size on the charge storage in small micropores with diameters similar to the size of the electrolyte ions. It was found that the maximum charge storage was achieved when the pore diameter is close to the ion size. Pores with diameters either smaller or larger than that of the electrolyte ions led to a significant drop in capacitance. These new findings, for both solvated salts and solvent-free liquid electrolytes, have not yet been fully understood because in such small micropores, there would be insufficient space to form an EDL. On the other hand, these new experimental discoveries have opened up opportunities for further increasing the capacitance of carbon electrodes. An impressive work in theoretical study towards the understanding of the charge storage mechanism was done by Huang et al.25 who proposed a heuristic model by taking the pore curvature into account. An electric double-cylinder capacitor (EDCC) model was proposed for pores in the mesoscale, and an electric wire-in-cylinder capacitor (EWCC) model was proposed for pores in the nanoscale. The two heuristic models fitted well with experimental data. Feng and Cummings26 used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the adsorption behavior of the solvent-free IL [emim][Tf2N] in slit-shaped pores. Both the anion and cation had similar sizes. It was assumed that approximately the same slit width was required for both electrodes. The maximum capacitances were found to be at slit widths (center-to-center distance between opposing walls) of 0.7 and 1.4 nm, respectively. The first maximum at 0.7 nm (about the same size of the electrolyte ions) agreed well with experimental results,24 while the second peak at 1.4 nm was a new feature. When the slit width was under 1 nm, both cations and anions were found to accumulate primarily at the central plane of the slits due to the confinement effect. As the slit width became narrower and narrower up to 0.7 nm, the capacitance became larger and larger because the distance between the ion and the pore wall became shorter and shorter. However, further reducing the slit width resulted in an increase of energy barriers for ions to enter into the slit. Thus, the capacitance diminished due to inaccessibility of the pore surface to the ion. When the slit width was larger than 1 nm, the ion distribution at an open surface decayed in the form of a wave. By analogy with the wave interference, the capacitance of two opposing surfaces was a result of ion distributions in between. More ions packed into the slit by constructive interference, while destructive interference reduced the capacitance by lessening the ions inside the slit. This wave-interference assumption explained the second capacitance peak at 1.4 nm and also predicted an oscillatory behavior of capacitance change as a function of slit width. The capacitance will eventually damp into the capacitance of EDLs near the open surface when the slit width is above 4.5 nm.
2.2 Pore geometry
The pore geometry of a carbon electrode also plays an important role in the capacitance performance. As electrolyte ions accumulate in the vicinity of the electrode surface upon charging, the ions must travel through pore channels to gain access to the whole surface. Thus, the pore geometry has a significant impact on the transport of the ions. It is however rather unlikely to establish a relationship between capacitance and pore geometry through an experimental approach since no two pores are exactly identical in an electrode. de Levie27 proposed a mathematical model for describing an ideal one-dimensional cylindrical pore and treated it as an RC transmission line. A decade later, Keiser and co-workers28 adopted the de Levie model to calculate the impedance of non-cylindrical pores. Nyquist plots corresponding to different pore shapes were reported. Lately, Robinson29 used the de Levie method to treat an EC electrode as an array of cylindrical pores. Each electrode array was determined by the number of cylindrical pores, the radius of the pores, and the pattern of the pore array. Then a pair of electrodes were stacked, rolled, and pleated to form the EC. Calculated values of energy and power densities from this model were in good agreement with experimental data. With the assistance of the above computational work, carbon electrodes with well-defined pores have been designed to increase the electrode capacitance, but with incremental improvements only.30,31
One should bear in mind that the de Levie model is not only geometrically, but also electrochemically simplified. It neglects ion diffusion and non-uniform distribution of the ion concentration in an electrolyte solution.32–36 Very recently, Wang and Pilon37 proposed a general set of boundary conditions to model a porous carbon electrode consisting of two types of pores with different pore sizes following the Poisson–Boltzmann model. The new boundary conditions were valid to simulate the Stern layer coupled with a diffuse layer for planar, cylindrical and spherical pores. It was found that the model can be used to predict the electrocapacitive behavior of electrodes with more than one pore systems. Numerical calculation results using this model were in good agreement with the experimental data.
Black and Andreas38 experimentally studied the charge redistribution in pores with different geometries at the open circuit potential (OCP). Five model electrodes with different pore sizes and shapes but with essentially the same surface area were used in the experiment. Each model pore was built up by fitting and splitting into seven cylindrical discs as shown in Fig. 3. The results showed that the pore mouth had a more dominant effect than the pore length on charge accumulation. Pores with a larger mouth had a higher charge transfer rate during charging, implying that cone-shaped pores are favorable for charge transportation. As the charge transfer resistance got stronger when ions went deeper and deeper into the pore, longer pores required more time to be fully charged to the same charge density per surface area than shorter pores. This directly results in a lower potential of the longer pores after charge redistribution, thus lowering the energy density. The results suggest that for high-power applications, shorter pores with a large pore mouth are desirable. For pores with a bottleneck geometry, results from this work showed that only the surface between the pore mouth and the bottleneck was available for adsorbing charges. Therefore, electrode materials with bottleneck pores are not ideal for ECs. Computational work using advanced calculation methods such as molecular simulations is needed to simulate the dependence of capacitance on the pore geometry.39
 Fig. 3  Charge distribution profiles in pores of different sizes and geometries.38 All the model pores have the same surface area. The initial plateau in the potential vs. time profiles indicates the size of pore mouth with smaller pore mouth having a wider plateau. The final potential plateau indicates the amount of charge stored on the pore surface. 
2.3 Electrical conductivity
The electrical conductivity of an electronic device is vital. During charging, electrons accumulate on one conductor (current collector plus one electrode), and depart from the other. The electrode–electrolyte interface within the porous electrode is balanced by the counter-ions from the electrolyte to store charges. It is crucial to control the electrical conductivity of the carbon electrodes in order to achieve the optimum specific capacitance and energy density of an EC. Seredych et al.40 reported that the addition of about 5 wt% graphene into a nanoporous sodium-salt-polymer-derived carbon resulted in an order of magnitude improvement in the electrical conductivity. Consequently, the utilization of the active pore space increased proportionally because the small pores (<0.7 nm) that were not previously being electrically connected now opened up. Tsay et al.41 studied the percentage of the conducting carbon, i.e. Super C45 and Super P Li, in the matrix of carbon black BP2000, and observed that the optimum capacitance and energy density were obtained when the conducting carbon content was in the range of 10–15 wt%. A further increase of conducting carbon content led to a decrease in electrocapacitive performance caused by reduced SSA of the electrode. Besides adding conducting materials to improve the electric conductivity, the current research trend focuses on synthesizing free standing and binder-free porous carbon with excellent intrinsic electric conductivity.42
2.4 Surface wettability
The wettability of an electrode is another important factor that should be considered while designing porous carbon materials. The carbon surface should be engineered to have appropriate wetting abilities towards a given electrolyte so as to facilitate the adsorption and transportation of the electrolyte ions. Kim et al.43 studied the surface properties of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as EC electrodes. Results showed that the presence of surface carboxyl groups led to an over three times larger capacitance due to the enhanced affinity of the electrode surface towards the electrolyte (1 M H2SO4). In contrast, modification of the MWCNTs with long chain alkyls resulted in a significant decrease in capacitance due to the blockage of protons in the electrolyte. A recent work of Jia and Zou44 demonstrated that the introduction of sulfonated groups on the graphene surface greatly enhanced the hydrophilicity of the graphene sheets. The sulfonated graphene nanosheets (GNSs) showed a better dispersion in water and an increased SSA probably due to the fact that negatively charged sulfonate groups created strong repulsive forces between the GNSs to prevent the sheets from agglomeration. The sulfonated GNSs were tested as the electrodes for capacitive desalination. The salt removal efficiency was increased over 100%. However, the effect of wettability is generally recognized by the indirect measurement of the conductivity and capacitance. Recently, Nishihara et al.45 established a method to determine the pore-filling ratio of a carbon electrode by using propylene carbonate as the electrolyte solvent. The method provides a facile way to screen the wettability of the electrodes with little error (less than 5%).
It should be pointed out that while surface functional groups can increase the hydrophilicity of carbon, the presence of such groups can have a negative impact on the electric conductivity because the functional groups can inhibit electron transport. A careful design is needed to balance the wettability and the electric conductivity.
3 Advanced porous carbon electrodes for electrochemical capacitors
3.1 Graphene-based electrodes
The use of graphene and CMG as an EC electrode has witnessed a strong momentum in the past decade. Graphene has a theoretical SSA of 2630 m2 g−1.46 Assuming graphite has an average area-normalized capacitance of 15 μF cm−2,47,48 the calculated gravimetric capacitance of a single layer graphene can be as high as 395 F g−1. However, the specific capacitance values for most graphene and CMG samples reported in the literature are in the range of 100–300 F g−1.49–55 The smaller-than-expected specific capacitance value is due to the agglomeration and restacking of the graphene sheets, lowering the effective SSA. To circumvent the restacking problem, a great deal of research effort has been spent on building three-dimensional (3D) porous structures using graphene sheets. Putting a spacer such as CNTs, metal oxides, and conducting polymers between graphene sheets is another effective approach to minimizing the agglomeration. These species act as ‘molecular wedges’ between graphene sheets to alleviate the restacking problem. Template assembly methods56–60 and CVD methods61–65 have been employed to prepare porous graphene structures. Recently, Cai et al.66 reported the growth of vertically oriented graphene using the radio frequency plasma-enhanced CVD method on a nickel substrate. The graphene films exhibited a vertical and open geometry. Due to its high electrical conductivity and fast ion transportation, the resulting EC provides an ultrafast dynamic response, with a specific capacitance of 74 μF cm−2 at the frequency of 1 kHz. Yadav et al.42 reported a one-step, template-free and catalyst-free method for preparing single-layer graphene assembled porous carbon (SGAPC) by a polymer pyrolysis route. The maleic acid units and poly(styrene sulfonate) units in poly(4-styrene-sulfonic acid-co-maleic acid) sodium salt (PSSCMA) allow the formation of both graphene single sheet and intra-sheet connections (see Fig. 4). This SGAPC with a SSA of 1720 m2 g−1 was tested as an EC electrode. A specific capacitance of ca. 154 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 was obtained in 1 M H2SO4. The good performance is owing to the good conductivity (23 S m−1) of the graphene framework and a large hexagonal porous structure. The material showed no sign of capacitance decay after 1000 charge–discharge cycles.

Spacing of graphene sheets with CNTs has been demonstrated by several research groups.67–69 Zhang et al.69 showed that CNTs can be structured as pillars between graphene layers via a Ni-catalyzed CVD approach as shown in Fig. 5. This electrode material exhibited a specific capacitance of 1235 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is attributed to the unique sandwich structure of graphene and CNTs. Here, the CNTs have three contributions: (1) a structure buffer for the large volume expansion of Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles during the charge–discharge process; (2) a spacer for graphene sheets for maintaining a high SSA; and (3) a good electric conductor. The electrode retained 80% of its original capacity after 500 cycles at a very high discharge current density (10 A g−1).

3.2 Advanced activated carbon electrodes
Both physical and chemical activation methods are commonly used to prepare ACs. The physical activation refers to the use of gasifying agents such as carbon dioxide, air or steam at high temperatures (usually in the range of 700–1200 °C) to create porosity in carbonaceous materials. The chemical activation is generally carried out at relatively low temperatures (in the range of 600–900 °C) with the aid of a chemical activating agent, such as KOH, ZnCl2, H3PO4, or chlorine gas. This activation method is more commonly used because of low energy consumption, high yield, well-developed pores, and low cost. Among the various chemical activating agents, KOH is the most wildly used one since it can allow one to control microporosity with a very high experimental SSA of more than 3000 m2 g−1 (this SSA is much higher than that of single layer graphene that is presumably due to the BET method, which strictly speaking, is not applicable to analyze microporous solids).70
Traditional methods of producing ACs do not offer sufficient control over porosity,23 leading to a porous carbon with a broad pore size distribution.71 Since both the pore size and distribution of a porous carbon electrode have a great impact on the capacitive behavior, the ability of controlling the pore size and distribution of the carbon will allow one to improve the performance of the carbon-based supercapacitors.
Although the mechanism of the KOH activation is an old subject of study, a complete understanding of the whole activation process is still poor. The chemical and physical properties of the resultant ACs are strongly influenced by experimental parameters, such as carbon/KOH mass ratio, temperature, time and carbonaceous precursor. Several reaction schemes have been proposed and summarized in a recent review.72 During the activation process, microcrystallites interact with each other to form different pore sizes.73 It is also reported that the microcrystallites of hard carbons (non-graphitizable) are difficult to change, even under high temperatures whereas soft carbons (graphitizable) are inclined to graphitization with elevated temperatures. Therefore, by proper selection of the carbon precursor and controlling over the activation parameters, advanced ACs can be produced with well-defined pore size and distribution.70,73–77 Zhai et al. prepared a series of ACs with pitch as the precursor (a typical soft carbon). By changing the activation temperature, the intersection of the microcrystallites is changed and the pore size varied between 1.7 and 2.1 nm. An AC sample with an SSA of 2258 m2 g−1 thus prepared possessed a specific capacitance of 145 F g−1 in an organic solvent (1 M of Et4NBF4 in propylene carbonate). Because of the appropriate pore size and relatively narrow pore size distribution, the AC had an energy density of 31 W h kg−1 at a power density of 12 kW kg−1.
Using KOH activation of microwave exfoliated graphite oxide (a-MEGO),70 Ruoff and co-workers prepared a porous carbon with an exceptionally high BET surface area (3100 m2 g−1), a high electrical conductivity (500 S m−1), and low oxygen and hydrogen contents. This sp2-bonded carbon has a continuous 3D network of highly curved, atom thick walls that formed pores of primarily 0.6–5 nm widths. A symmetric EC cell constructed with this porous carbon as both electrodes displayed a specific capacitance of 166 F g−1 in 1-butyl-2-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIMBF4)/acetonitrile electrolyte at a constant current of 5.7 A g−1. The a-MEGO is stable in BMIM BF4 electrolyte. About 97% of its initial capacitance was retained after 10000 charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 2.5 A g−1. In comparison, a relatively low volumetric capacitance (60 F cm−3 for a-MEGO) is usually associated with ACs having a large total pore volume due to the low density (∼0.3 g cm−3 of the as-made a-MEGO electrode).
Improvement in the volumetric capacitance was demonstrated by Murali et al. by simply compressing the a-MEGO-based material.78 A volumetric capacitance of up to 110 F cm−3 at 1 A g−1 and 3.5 V measured in a two-electrode cell in an organic electrolyte was achieved. Nitrogen adsorption showed that the mesopores of the a-MEGO (∼4 nm) collapsed to form micropores (1–2 nm) due to the compression, and it was the newly formed micropores that contributed to the enhanced energy storage in the compressed electrode. However, this change in pore structure led to an increase in the effective series resistance, thus lowering the power density of the compressed sample.
A robust 3D interconnected carbon network with a good electrical conductivity and an appropriate pore size will favor both electron and ion transport. The ability to reduce or completely eliminate the contact resistance between the primary grains of an electrode material and between the active material and the current collector is very important for high-power applications. Zhang et al. demonstrated a novel method to prepare highly conductive, free-standing and flexible porous carbon thin films by KOH activation of reduced graphene oxide papers as illustrated in Fig. 6.74 The flexible thin films have a very high specific surface area of 2400 m2 g−1 and a high in-plane electrical conductivity of 5880 S m−1. The enhanced surface area of the material is attributed to its unusual atomic structure – the internal surface (namely the walls of the nanopores) is highly curved likely because the hexagonal ‘honeycomb’ structure has some heptagons and octagons, which might create a 'negative curvature'.70 Elemental analysis revealed a very low H content of less than 0.5 wt% and a high C/O atomic ratio of 14, higher than that of ‘chemically converted’ graphene sheets.79 A symmetric two-electrode EC with the carbon films as both electrodes showed an excellent high-frequency response (the RC time constant was ∼3 ms at 120 Hz), and a high power density of about 500 kW kg−1. Efficient EDL formation within the porous thin films was observed as the area-normalized capacitance decreased slightly (from 14 to 11 μF cm−2) when the scan rate was increased from 50 to 400 mV s−1. The highly interconnected 3D structure and short diffusion pathways are believed to favor fast charge transport. The kinetic features of ion diffusion in the porous thin films were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. An extremely low equivalent series resistance (ESR) of about 0.1 Ohm was obtained, even smaller than that reported for a thin carbon nanotube sheet electrode.80 The new carbon films also exhibited an excellent performance with a specific capacitance as high as 120 F g−1 and an energy density of 26 W h kg−1 at the power density of 500 kW kg−1. The cycling performance of the carbon thin films showed negligible capacitance degradation (∼95% capacitance retention) after 2000 cycles, indicating a very stable electrode material.

3.3 Carbide-derived carbons (CDCs)
CDCs, a family of nanoporous carbon, are produced by removal of M from MC (e.g., TiC and SiC) compounds using the chlorination method at temperatures ranging from 600 to 1000 °C. Gogotsi and Yoshimura81 were the first to demonstrate the preparation of CDCs from MC using the hydrothermal corrosion method at high pressure. Later on, the same research group demonstrated the use of a halogen gas to extract M from MC at atmospheric pressure.82 This method is more favorable because volatile halides instead of an oxide are formed. CDCs with uniform nanopores and high surface areas can be obtained by chlorination of SiC at atmospheric pressure and elevated temperatures. Thermodynamic simulations also indicated that the carbon formation is the most favorable reaction at high temperatures (above 900 °C). Recently, CDCs have been extensively studied because of their tunable porosity with sub-angstrom accuracy and narrow pore size distribution.83
Due to the rigid carbide lattice and layer-by-layer extraction process, pore collapse and necking are minimized during the high temperature treatment. The formation of micropores can be well controlled on an atomic level. The pore size of the CDCs is very uniform because of the highly uniform distribution of carbon in the MC precursor. Several research groups have investigated CDCs. SSA up to 2700 m2 g−1 has been obtained. Controllable pore size and distribution are achievable.84 Gogotsi and coworkers demonstrated the precise control over the micropore size in CDCs by controlling the temperature.23,24,83 CDCs with pores tunable as accurate as 0.05 nm and pore sizes in the range of ∼0.5 to ∼3 nm are attractive candidates as a standard material for studying the relationship between pore size and capacitance. Using titanium carbide as the carbon precursor, CDCs with average pore sizes ranging from 0.6 to 2.25 nm were prepared and used as EC electrodes in an organic electrolyte. An anomalous increase in capacitance was observed in the CDCs having average pore sizes less than 1 nm (Fig. 7). This observation has posed a great challenge on the long-held axiom that pores smaller than the size of solvated electrolyte ions are inaccessible to the ions, thus not contributing to charge storage.23 Partial desolvation of ions in the pores that are less than the size of solvated ions was proposed to explain the accessibility of the sub-nanopores (pores of width < 1 nm).85
 Fig. 7  Change of the normalized capacitance as a function of the average pore size of CDC electrodes.23 
Although the sub-nanopores lead to a high capacitance, the charge and discharge rates are significantly lowered in the small pores of CDCs. One solution to solving the poor power performance of the CDC-based ECs is to shorten the ion transport pathways by decreasing the particle size. Portet et al. demonstrated a moderate improvement in the rate performance of CDC-based ECs by using nano-sized CDC particles.86 While the study proved that small particles indeed facilitate the migration of electrolyte ions inside the porous electrodes, the overall improvement of power density was very limited due to the tortuous and highly curved pore channels, together with the lack of appropriate mesopores.
Ordered hierarchical micro and mesoporous CDCs (OM-CDC) with straight pore channels were prepared by Yushin's group.84,87 The structure and porosity of the OM-CDC are shown in Fig. 8. While the micropores resulted in outstanding adsorption capacity, the ordered mesoporous channels in the CDC served as ion-highways and allow for very fast ion transportation into the bulk of the CDC particles. The resultant CDC showed 85% capacitance retention at current densities up to ∼20 A g−1 (150 F g−1 at the current density of 17 A g−1) in 1 M TEABF4/AN electrolyte.

In spite of the promising energy storage capability of CDC-based electrodes, control over the pore size and hierarchy using a facile method still remains a challenge, yet it is important for developing new-generation ECs.
3.4 Ordered porous carbons
Highly ordered porous carbons with an interconnected pore system and a narrow pore size distribution at the nanoscale are crucial in developing high-energy and high-power density ECs. The template method is a powerful technique to realize such materials with desired properties to meet the specific requirements of various applications.88,89 Though the high production cost and the multi-step preparation of the ordered templated porous carbons make it difficult for practical application, they offer an effective way to produce model materials for insight understanding of the energy storage mechanism, so as to lead to the new era of material design for next generation ECs.
Ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) was first reported by Ryoo's group using mesoporous silica as a hard template.90–94 OMC electrodes showed only moderate performance despite the well-controlled mesopore size. Increasing the SSA;95 designing hierarchical porous structures with the presence of mesopores, micropores, and macropores;96,97 designing short and straight 3D pore channels;45 optimizing the pore size to best match with electrolyte ions24,85 and decorating OMCs with pseudo-active materials98,99 have since then been demonstrated.
KOH activation of an OMC dramatically increased SSA from 520 to 1940 m2 g−1. The activated OMC exhibited an improved gravimetric capacitance of 188 F g−1 in an aqueous electrolyte, higher than the OMC before KOH activation (71 F g−1).95 Hollow spheres prepared using colloidal silica as a template with a SSA of 658 m2 g−1 exhibited a specific capacitance of 266 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in KOH solution.96 About 73% of the specific capacitance was retained when the current density was increased to 20 A, indicating a very good rate capability of the hierarchical structure. Mesoporous carbon nanospheres (MCNs) with a uniform diameter of about 65 nm (see Fig. 9) and primary mesopores of about 2.7 nm diameter prepared using mesoporous silica nanospheres as the template and ferrocene as the carbon precursor exhibited an SSA as high as 2396 m2 g−1 and the total pore volume of 2.9 cm3 g−1.100 A symmetric EC cell based on the MCNs as electrodes exhibited a specific capacitance of 180 F g−1 in an organic electrolyte (TEABF4 in AN), and delivered an energy density as high as 62.8 W h kg−1 at a power density of 162 W kg−1. The energy density retained was 78% after 700 cycles at a current density of 3 A g−1.

Zeolite-templated carbons possess a very uniform and ordered pore structure without the presence of other pores, such as ultramicropores, mesopores or macropores.45 Yushin and co-workers102 demonstrated that a zeolite-templated microporous carbon exhibited a high specific capacitance of 146 F g−1 in an organic electrolyte. The capacitance was found to increase linearly with the SSA of the carbon. Nishihara and co-workers45 observed that three-dimensionally connected and regularly arranged micropores were very effective in reducing the ion transfer resistance. A carbon electrode with a pore diameter of 1.2 nm did not display an obvious increase in ion transfer resistance when the charge current density was increased from 0.05 to 2 A g−1 in an organic electrolyte. The authors concluded that the pore diameter, regularity of the pore arrangement, and 3D penetration of the ordered pores are the keys.
Xia et al.101 demonstrated the preparation of 3D ordered meso- and microporous carbon sphere arrays (MMCSAs) using the colloidal template method in combination with chlorination of the mesoporous TiC/C composite as schematically illustrated in Fig. 10. With the mesopore size at ∼8.5 nm, micropore sizes of 0.69 and 1.51 nm and an interconnected window size of about 60 nm, the MMCSA exhibited a good rate capability and stability in an organic electrolyte with a cell voltage of 3 V.

3.5 Modification of porous carbons
The combination of EDL capacitance with pseudo-capacitance in one electrode can enable significant improvement in the energy density of porous carbon-based electrodes. The good electrical conductivity and well-defined pores of the carbon facilitate ion and electron transport. On the other hand, the pseudo-capacitance coming from a pseudo-capacitive material, such as metal oxides or conducting polymers, enhances the energy storage capability.

3.5.1 Modification by atomic doping and functionalization. 
It is important to point out the difference between the electronic modification of a low dimensional carbon electrode (such as single and few layer graphene) via change of its density of states (DOS) by light foreign atom doping and chemical functionalization of the carbon surface by decoration with various kinds of functionalities.17 The energy storage of the former one is based on the EDL mechanism, where the introduction of foreign atoms is to increase the charge carrier density so as to increase the DOS of the low dimensional electrode material. This will in turn improve the interfacial capacitance of the graphene electrode and the overall capacitance is enhanced without losing the stability of the electrode. A recent study by Zhang et al. has shown the effect of insertion of foreign atoms into the carbon network on the specific capacitance by using lightly nitrogen-doped a-MEGO as the electrode material.17 The area-normalized capacitances were observed to increase from 6 μF cm−2 to 11 and 22 μF cm−2 at atomic doping nitrogen levels of 1% and 2.3%, respectively. They also showed that the interfacial capacitance is very sensitive to various impurities and the charge carrier concentration. Fig. 11 shows the experimental setup and the dependence of quantum capacitance on the dopant concentration as a function of graphene potential.17

(C) Dependence of quantum capacitance (CQ) on the N dopant concentration as a function of Vch. (D) Correlation between bulk capacitance obtained from N-aMEGO based electrodes and quantum capacitance from NGs as a function of N concentration.17 
The improvement in capacitance by chemical functionalization originates from the fast redox reactions between the surface functional groups and protons in the electrolyte. Nitrogen- and oxygen-containing groups are the most common functional groups on the carbon surface. Nitrogen-containing groups can be introduced by post-modification with ammoxidation or urea. Using a nitrogen-containing carbon precursor to prepare AC is another approach to inducing nitrogen-containing groups. Oxygen-containing groups can be introduced during carbonization by using an oxygen-rich carbon precursor, or by post-treatment using plasma, molecular oxygen, and oxidative chemicals (e.g., HNO3). The preparation of ordered microporous carbons with a large amount of N- and O-containing functional groups (6 wt% N and 7.7 wt% O) was demonstrated.13–16 A microporous carbon electrode with a SSA of 1680 m2 g−1 displayed a large gravimetric capacitance of 340 F g−1 in aqueous electrolyte with a moderate cycle stability.13 About 75% of its initial capacitance was retained after 10000 cycles at a voltage window of 1.2 V in 1 M H2SO4. N-doped graphene nanosheets (NGS) with nitrogen level as high as 10.1 at% were prepared by hydrothermal treatment of graphene oxide and urea.16 N-doping and reduction of graphene oxide were achieved simultaneously under the hydrothermal conditions. The NGS with a SSA of 593 m2 g−1 exhibited a capacitance of 326 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 using a symmetric cell design. The results also showed that pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N species are mainly responsible for improving the pseudocapacitance while quaternary-N species play a role in enhancing the electric conductivity of the material. Beguin and co-workers15 studied the electrochemical performance of porous carbons with oxygen contents in the range of 10–15 at% prepared by pyrolysis of seaweeds. It was found that the nature of the oxygenated functionalities and the pH of the electrolyte all influenced the capacitance and stable potential window. The surface oxygen species influenced the over-potentials of di-hydrogen evolution and carbon oxidation. A very high stable potential window of 2.4 V was observed for the porous carbon in Na2SO4 electrolyte. Symmetric capacitors based on porous carbons indeed exhibited an excellent stability with negligible capacitance loss after 10000 cycles for the potential window up to 1.6 V in Na2SO4 electrolyte.


3.5.2 Modification with conducting polymers. 
Another popular pseudo-capacitive material is the conducting polymer. However, the swelling and shrinkage of the polymer backbone during the charge–discharge processes severely affect the cyclability. By using porous carbon as a substrate or support, the stability of the conducting polymer can be improved. In the meantime, the overall capacitance can be enhanced because of both EDL contribution from the porous carbon substrate and the pseudo-capacitance from the conducting polymer.21,22,98,103,104
Conducting polymers such as polyaniline (PANi), polypyrrole (PPy) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) are the most studied pseudo-capacitive materials. Coating a thin layer of PANi on ordered mesoporous104 and macroporous carbons98 doubled the capacitance. Placing the conducting polymer in between GO layers was demonstrated on the basis of the electrostatic interactions between negatively charged GO sheets and positively charged surfactant micelles.21 Zhang and Zhao22 directly coated conducting polymers PEDOT, PANi, and PPy on the surface of RGO sheets using an in situ polymerization method. The RGO-PANi was reported to have a specific capacitance of 361 F g−1 at 0.3 A g−1, while RGO-PPy and RGO-PEDOT exhibited specific capacitances of 248 and 108 F g−1, respectively. CMG/PANi nanofiber composites were reported to display a high specific capacitance (480 F g−1) and a good cycling stability.105 A GO/PPy composite exhibited a very good electrocapacitive performance with a high specific capacitance over 500 F g−1. A good rate capability and cyclability were realized as well. CMG/conducting-polymer composite electrodes have a number of advantages, including (1) exfoliated GO sheets provide a large accessible surface for the attachment of a conducting polymer on both sides to form a 3D layered structure; (2) the 3D layered structure can enhance the mechanical strength of the composite and stabilize the polymer during the charge–discharge cycle; (3) the presence of the conducting polymer between GO layers effectively reduces the dynamic resistance of the transport of electrolyte ions; (4) the readily accessible conducting polymer contributes pseudo-capacitance to the overall device performance. Fig. 12 shows the electrocapacitive performances of CMG/conducting-polymer composite electrodes reported in the literature. It should be noted that the capacitance data reported in Fig. 12 were collected using a three-electrode cell, which can overestimate the cell performance significantly. It is recommended to use a two-electrode cell to test electrode materials following the industrial test standards and procedures.106,107

3.5.3 Modification with metal oxides. 
Metal oxides can provide a high pseudo-capacitance with a relatively better electrochemical stability than conducting polymers. But they suffer from poor electrical conductivity and small potential windows. The conductivity can be improved by the coupling of the oxide with carbon materials and the potential window can be improved by configuring asymmetric cells.118,119 Jiang et al.18 reviewed the recent progress in the development of mesoporous carbons incorporated with metal oxide nanomaterials and their performance as EC electrodes. The general requirements for porous carbon/metal oxide composites for EC applications are:120 (1) the composite should be electronically conductive; (2) the metal can exist in two or more stable oxidation states that coexist over a continuous range with no phase changes involving irreversible modification of the composite structure; (3) protons can freely intercalate into and out of the oxide lattice during redox reaction, allowing facial conversion of O2− ↔ OH−. The commonly investigated oxides are manganese oxides, ruthenium oxides, cobalt oxides, nickel oxides, ion oxides and vanadium oxides.
Manganese oxides received great attention because of their high theoretical pseudo-capacitance value, low cost and environmental compatibilities.121 ACs, OMCs,99,122 CNTs,123–125 carbon nanofoams,126 hierarchical porous carbons127 and CMG118,128–130 have all been used to improve the electrical conductivity of manganese oxides, which is in the range of 10−5 to 10−6 S cm−1. Cheng et al.130 prepared the graphene/MnO2 nanowire composite by solution-phase assembly of graphene sheets and MnO2 nanowires. An asymmetric supercapacitor based on the composite material as the positive electrode and graphene as the negative electrode were assembled in an aqueous Na2SO4 solution. The EC can be cycled reversibly within a high voltage window of 2 V and a specific capacitance of 124 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Further enhancement of the energy density was achieved by incorporation of nanosized manganese oxide particles (2–3 nm) into a 3D highly porous activated graphene scaffold via a self-controlled redox process.118 With the use of a high specific area activated graphene as the negative electrode and the activated graphene/MnO2 as the positive electrode, a specific capacitance of 175 F g−1 was obtained with a cell voltage of 2 V, which translated to an energy density of 24.3 W h kg−1 for a power density of 24.5 kW kg−1 in a neutral aqueous electrolyte. The hybrid EC also showed a good cycle life with a capacitance retention of 80.4% after 5000 charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1. In addition, the ESR values obtained from the frequency response analysis (ESR was measured every 1000 cycles) revealed a small drop (from 1.4 to 0.8 ohms) in the first 2000 cycles with only subtle changes in the remaining cycles. It should be pointed out that there is a compromise among energy density, power density and cyclability for the composite materials consisting of porous carbon and pseudo-active species (Fig. 13).

4 Summary and perspectives
The past ten years or so have witnessed significant breakthroughs in advanced carbon materials, such as graphene and CMG. The availability of these novel carbons has offered great opportunities in developing innovative electrodes for new-generation ECs. In spite of the great advancements in carbon materials science, a fundamental understanding from atomic and molecular perspectives of the charge storage mechanism is still lacking and challenging. New physical insights into the phenomena occurring at an electrode–electrolyte interface, electrochemical behavior of electrolyte ions in confined nanopores, and the nature of electrode–electrolyte interactions will greatly accelerate the development of ECs.
Due to the large electrochemical windows, safe operation and flexible combinations of ions, ILs are promising electrolytes for the development of new-generation ECs. A deep understanding of the structure at the electrode–electrolyte interface, surface wettability of an electrode towards ILs, and transport properties of ILs in porous carbons will boost the development of mass-energy-storage capacitors for renewable energy sources and electric vehicles.
Recent experimental and simulation studies have shown that porous carbon electrodes with subnanometer pores exhibit an anomalous increase in normalized capacitance, triggering great interest in using subnanometer pores for improving the energy density of ECs. It must be kept in mind that while these subnanometer pores are efficient in storing charges, the presence of appropriate ion diffusion channels in the porous carbon is crucial for high power performance. Hence, future advanced porous carbon electrodes should be designed to meet the requirements for both high energy and high power applications.
The quantum capacitance due to low density of states existing in a 2D carbon150 may represent a future direction.
