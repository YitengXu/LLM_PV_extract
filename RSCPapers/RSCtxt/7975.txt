    , Accepted 29th June 2018First published on 3rd July 2018AbstractThe development of the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique is of high interest for the integration of a semiconducting layer onto high aspect ratio nanoscale structures. We show the deposition of an Sb2S3 shell by SILAR on top of ZnO/TiO2 core–shell nanowire heterostructures, using antimony chloride and sodium sulfide as cationic and anionic precursors, respectively. The conformal anatase-TiO2 shell deposited by atomic layer deposition acts as a protective layer to chemically stabilize these heterostructures with a type II band alignment in the cationic precursor solution. The resulting Sb2S3 shell is composed of uniformly distributed Sb2S3 clusters crystallized at a relatively low temperature of 250 °C from the bottom to the top of ZnO nanowires. It is, further, of high purity, where only a very minor senarmontite-Sb2O3 phase is detected by Raman spectroscopy, and exhibits a relevant band gap energy of 1.74 eV derived from a Tauc plot in the framework of the double pass analysis. These findings reveal the high potential of the SILAR technique to form ZnO core–shell nanowire heterostructures with high uniformity at moderate temperature as well as its advantages over the most widely used chemical bath deposition technique.
Introduction
Antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) has attracted much attention over the past decade as a promising p-type semiconductor, owing to its relative abundance, low toxicity, and cost-effectiveness.1–3 It crystallizes into the orthorhombic stibnite structure belonging to the Pbnm space group4 and further exhibits a band gap energy of 1.73 eV along with a high absorption coefficient of 7.5 × 104 cm−1 at 550 nm.1,5–7 All of these characteristics are suitable for a wide variety of electronic, storage, and optoelectronic devices,8–10 including solid state sensitized solar cells.11–13 Choi et al. showed the fabrication of Sb2S3-sensitized solar cells with a photo-conversion efficiency of 7.5%, by using mesoporous TiO2 as an electron transporting material.14 Alternatively, ZnO is a promising n-type semiconductor to replace mesoporous TiO2, owing to its abundance, nontoxicity, and ease of growth as nanostructures with different shapes,15 as well as its lower resistivity and higher electron mobility.16 The performances of related sensitized solar cells could be further improved by using ZnO in the form of nanowire (NW) arrays in order to benefit from light trapping phenomena and efficient charge carrier management.17,18 However, the combination of Sb2S3 and ZnO thin films or ZnO NW arrays in the framework of extremely thin absorber (ETA) solar cells has not been much reported owing to technological compatibility.19–22 C. P. Liu et al. showed the use of ZnO flat and nanostructured thin films in Sb2S3-sensitized solar cells with a photo-conversion efficiency of 2.4 and 2.9%, respectively.19,20 Nevertheless, the use of vacuum evaporation for depositing Sb2S3 is a strong limitation to further developing its integration as a conformal, uniform shell on top of ZnO NW arrays with a length of a few micrometers. Han et al. developed the formation of ZnO/ZnS/Sb2S3 core–shell NW heterostructures by using thioacetamide immersion and metal cation exchange processes for depositing Sb2S3, but the resulting ETA solar cells with a photo-conversion efficiency of 1.32% were degraded by high surface recombinations at different uncontrolled interfaces.21 More recently, the development of ZnO/TiO2/Sb2S3 core–shell NW heterostructures was achieved by using chemical spray pyrolysis for depositing Sb2S3, leading to the fabrication of ETA solar cells with a photo-conversion efficiency of 2.3%.22 In the present context, one of the major issues is to develop the most appealing growth technique for depositing Sb2S3 that is further compatible with the stability of ZnO NW arrays.
The growth of Sb2S3 thin films is typically achieved by spray pyrolysis,23 atomic layer deposition (ALD),24 aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition,25 electrodeposition,26 thermal evaporation,27 or, to a larger extent, chemical bath deposition (CBD), as a low-cost, low-temperature, and easily implemented growth technique.28 The widely used CBD consists in mixing antimony trichloride (SbCl3) dissolved in acetone with sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) dissolved in deionized water at a relatively low temperature in the range of 3 to 10 °C. Post-deposition annealing is required to crystallize the stibnite Sb2S3 phase and this generally proceeds at 300 °C for 30 min under a nitrogen atmosphere.29 The present annealing method however generally results in the formation of isolated pyramid-shaped clusters originating from the massive diffusive transport of Sb and S atoms, which are highly detrimental for their integration into ETA solar cells made of ZnO NW arrays.30,31 More importantly, the senarmontite cubic Sb2O3 phase is generally formed during the CBD process and represents a parasitic residual phase that strongly limits the performances of related devices. The topmost surface layer containing the parasitic Sb2O3 phase can for instance be removed by thioacetamide treatment, but it is expected that the phase still occurs in the bulk.14 Following these considerations, the growth of a crystallized and homogeneous Sb2S3 shell with a small thickness on ZnO NW arrays would be a great challenge using CBD,32,33 especially due to the high reaction rate which does not favor perfect control of its morphology and structural uniformity.
The successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique appears to be an alternative promising low-cost and low-temperature process34,35 to be explored for depositing Sb2S3 on top of ZnO NWs or nanostructures.36–41 Cations and anions, previously dissolved in dedicated solvents, from two different chemical precursors are successively adsorbed and react, respectively, on the substrate surface to form a conformal layer of the expected material.34 This technique can easily be upscaled and is compatible with industrial applications. It further strongly limits the homogeneous nucleation into the solution, reducing the loss of matter and increasing the yield especially as compared to CBD.35 Owing to the layer-by-layer growth mode, the film thickness can be readily tuned by adjusting simple parameters. Basically, the morphology and structural properties of the deposited material depend on the immersion times in the chemical precursor solutions and in the rinsing baths, the concentration of the chemical precursors, the cycle number and the post-deposition annealing conditions.34 The deposit quality also depends on the nature of the substrate used, as has already been shown by CBD.42,43 This technique has been initially developed for the deposition of oxide-based and sulfur-based binary compounds such as CdO, ZnO, and Cu2O (ref. 44 and 45), as well as ZnS and CdS,46 and has more recently been used for the integration of an Sb2S3 film into TiO2 NW arrays39 as well as of CdTe or CdS shells into ZnO NW arrays47 for the fabrication of ETA solar cells.
In this article, we report the development of ZnO/TiO2/Sb2S3 core–shell NW heterostructures using the SILAR technique for depositing Sb2S3 and their characterization by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) in in-plane and out-of-plane configurations, Raman scattering, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The findings reveal the relevance of using the SILAR technique on high aspect ratio nanoscale structures.
Experimental
30 nm-thick ZnO seed layers were grown by a sol–gel process using dip coating on top of a (0001) Si wafer cleaned by ultrasonic bath in acetone and isopropanol.48 The solution of chemical precursors was achieved by mixing 375 mM of zinc acetate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) and 375 mM of monoethanolamine (MEA) in pure ethanol and stirring the mixture on a hot plate kept at 60 °C for a couple of hours and then at room temperature for 24 h. The samples were slowly dipped and gently pulled out under a controlled atmosphere with a humidity lower than 15% at a withdrawal speed of 3.3 mm s−1. They were further annealed on a hot plate kept at 300 °C for 10 min and then at 500 °C for 1 h. The growth of ZnO NW arrays was performed by CBD using an aqueous solution containing 30 mM of zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) and 30 mM of hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA).49 The samples were placed horizontally face down in a sealed beaker in a regular oven kept at 90 °C for 3 h. The deposition of the anatase-TiO2 shell covering the ZnO NW arrays was performed by ALD using an F200 Fiji reactor (Cambridge Nanotech) maintained at 200 °C. Tetrakis dimethylamino titanium (TDMAT) and H2O were alternately injected via sequential pulses of 0.1 s, each pulse being followed by a purge of 10 s. TDMAT was heated at 75 °C beforehand. The chamber pressure was set to 11 mTorr and increased up to 200 mTorr, when each pulse was injected. The number of cycles was set to 150. The samples were post-annealed in air in an oven kept at 300 °C for 3 h for crystallizing the amorphous TiO2 layer into the anatase-TiO2 phase. The deposition of the stibnite-Sb2S3 shell onto ZnO/TiO2 core–shell NW heterostructures was achieved by the SILAR technique at room temperature. The samples were successively immersed in four PTFE beakers that were placed on a motorized rotary holder automatically monitored with the help of Perfect Motion software. The four solutions contained 7 mM SbCl3 dissolved in pure ethanol, pure ethanol (i.e., first rinsing), 7 mM Na2S dissolved in deionized water, and pure ethanol (i.e., second rinsing). The dipping and rinsing times were fixed to 60 and 20 s, respectively. The same procedure was achieved for 90 cycles with a refreshing of the ethanol rinsing baths every 10 cycles to avoid potential contamination. To complete the crystallization of the stibnite-Sb2S3 phase, post-deposition annealing at 250 °C was done in a tubular oven under a nitrogen atmosphere with the time varying in the range of 30 min to 1 h.
FESEM images were collected with a ZEISS Ultra 55 FEG-SEM operating at an accelerating voltage of 4 kV. TEM specimens were prepared by scratching the surface of the ZnO/TiO2/Sb2S3 core–shell NW heterostructures using a diamond tip and put on a copper grid. TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were recorded with a JEOL 2010 LaB6 microscope operating at 200 kV with a 0.19 nm point-to-point resolution. XRD patterns in in-plane and out-of-plane configurations were collected with a RIGAKU SmartLab diffractometer equipped with a 9 kW rotating anode operating at 200 mA and 45 kV. Both the in-plane and out-of-plane configurations used Cu radiation, where λ was the average of Kα(Cu) and equalled 1.544 Å. XRD measurements following the standard out-of-plane configuration were performed in the range of 10 to 60° on the 2-theta scale with a step of 0.008° and 0.1 s per step. XRD measurements in the in-plane configuration were run on a 5 circle goniometer which was specifically designed for in-plane acquisitions. The X-ray beam was about 5 mm parallel to the sample surface and 2 mm perpendicular to the sample surface. As the acquisition proceeded, the samples were kept horizontal and stuck with an ethanol droplet on a double tilt stage. The omega incidence was 0.15°. 2 Theta–chi/phi XRD measurements were performed in the range of 10 to 60° with a step of 0.04° and a speed of 1.0° min−1. The 00-036-1451, 00-021-1272, 00-042-1393, and 00-005-0534 files of the International Center for Diffraction Data (ICDD) were used for the wurtzite-ZnO, anatase-TiO2, stibnite-Sb2S3, and senarmontite-Sb2O3 phases, respectively. Raman scattering was performed with a Jobin Yvon/Horiba Labram spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled CCD detector. The 632.8 nm excitation line of a He–Ne laser was used and the power at the sample surface was lower than 114 μW. The light was focused to a spot size smaller than 1 μm2 using a 50 times long working distance objective. Raman spectra were calibrated using a silicon reference sample at room temperature with a theoretical position of 520.7 cm−1. The optical parameters including the total transmittance (TS) were measured in the wavelength range of 310 to 1250 nm with a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. The absorption A was determined as follows: A = 100% − TS.
Results and discussion
The description of the different steps comprising the SILAR process of the Sb2S3 shell is presented in the schematic in Fig. 1. One single cycle is composed of four successive, separated steps, involving (1) the adsorption of Sb3+ cations and the further creation of the Helmholtz double electrical layer by dipping the substrate in the cationic precursor solution, (2) the first rinsing in pure ethanol for removing the non-adsorbed Sb3+ species as well as the residual Cl− ions, (3) the reaction of S2− anions with adsorbed Sb3+ cations to form solid amorphous Sb2S3 by dipping the substrate in the anionic precursor solution, and (4) the second rinsing in pure ethanol for removing the non-adsorbed S2− species as well as the residual Na+ ions. These steps are summarized by the following simplified chemical reactions:34 Sb3+ cation adsorption: Sb3+ + 3Cl−(1) S2− anion reaction: 2Sb3+ + (3S2− + 6Na+) → Sb2S3(s) + 6Na+(2)

The Sb2S3 SILAR deposition is thus conducted by the following chemical reaction:36 2Sb3+ + 3S2− → Sb2S3(s)(3)
A significant number of cycles (i.e., 90 here) are required to achieve the growth of a solid amorphous Sb2S3 shell with a thickness of the order of several tens of nanometers. The main difficulty of the deposition of the Sb2S3 shell by SILAR on top of ZnO NW arrays originates from i) the fact that ZnO is no longer stable and dissociates in the low pH cationic precursor solution in step (1) and ii) the post-deposition annealing in step (5) to crystallize the stibnite-Sb2S3 phase generally inducing a massive diffusive transport of Sb and S atoms forming pyramid-shaped clusters that are incompatible with ETA solar cells.
The structural morphology and properties of the ZnO/TiO2 core–shell NW heterostructures covered with the Sb2S3 shell as-deposited and annealed at 250 °C for 30, 40, and 60 min are presented in Fig. 2–5. The stability of ZnO NW arrays is improved by depositing a protective TiO2 shell by ALD. The present 8 nm-thick shell, as determined by TEM imaging, is highly conformal and covers the ZnO NWs from the very bottom to the top as well as the ZnO seed layer between the ZnO NWs to favor their stable immersion in the cationic precursor solution, as shown in Fig. 2 and 3. The anatase-TiO2 phase is crystallized by post-deposition annealing at 300 °C for 3 h and results in the occurrence of the Raman line at 144 cm−1 assigned to its low-frequency Eg phonon mode,50 as presented in Fig. 4. No ZnO Raman line occurs owing to the low laser power used and to the related low penetration depth. The (101), (103), (004), (105), and (211) diffraction peaks of the anatase-TiO2 phase revealing the diffracting plane parallel to the surface occur at 25.3, 37, 37.9, 54, and 55.3°, respectively, in the out-of-plane configuration (see Fig. 5a). Correlatively, the (002) diffraction peak of the ZnO NWs with the wurtzite phase is predominant as they grow along the c-axis. In contrast, the (101), (105), and (211) diffraction peaks of the anatase-TiO2 phase revealing the diffracting plane perpendicular to the surface occur at 25.3, 54, and 55.3 °, respectively, in the in-plane configuration (see Fig. 5b). Correlatively, the (100) diffraction peak of the ZnO NWs dominates since they exhibit m-plane vertical sidewalls. Given that the anatase-TiO2 shell is mainly located on these vertical sidewalls, the XRD spectrum in the in-plane configuration yields an insight into its growth texture. Following a quantitative texture analysis in the framework of the Harris method,51,52 it is found that the TiO2 shell is textured with the (101) and (200) planes parallel to the growth surface.

The as-deposited Sb2S3 shell grown by SILAR on the TiO2 shell is mainly composed of clusters homogeneously distributed on top and on the sidewalls of ZnO NWs, as shown in the FESEM images in Fig. 2a and e. The formation of Sb2S3 clusters or agglomerates instead of a homogeneous, continuous thin layer on top of TiO2 surfaces is relatively typical of the SILAR technique.36–41 It is expected that preferential nucleation zones occur on the anatase-TiO2 shell, especially at specific grain boundaries, at some places where the crystalline quality is higher, or at the free surface of some grains with preferential orientations. Correlatively, no sign of the presence of diffraction peaks corresponding to the as-deposited Sb2S3 shell occurs in the in-plane and out-of-plane configurations. Only a weak Raman band at about 300 cm−1 and close to the Si Raman line at 303 cm−1 may be indicative of the formation of the amorphous Sb2S3 shell.53
Very interestingly, the post-deposition annealing at 250 °C results in a noticeable smoothing of the Sb2S3 shell while avoiding the formation of pyramid-shaped clusters on top of the ZnO/TiO2 NW heterostructures, as revealed in Fig. 2b–d and f–h as well as in the TEM images in Fig. 3. A large number of diffraction peaks in the range of 10 to 60° show the crystallization of the stibnite-Sb2S3 phase in the form of a polycrystalline shell in both in-plane and out-of-plane configurations in Fig. 5. No epitaxy occurs at the interface between the TiO2 and Sb2S3 shell. In the out-of-plane configuration and in contrast to the in-plane configuration, a broad band in the range of 14 to 20° may all the same indicate the presence of a very minor amorphous Sb2S3 phase. Generally, the intensity of the diffraction peaks of the Sb2S3 shell is more pronounced, as the annealing time is increased from 30 to 40 and 60 min in both configurations. The occurrence of the (110) diffraction peak at the longest annealing time is noted in the out-of-plane configuration. Similarly to the previous considerations, the XRD spectra in the in-plane configuration reveal the growth texture of the Sb2S3 shell. Following the Harris method,51,52 it is shown that the Sb2S3 shell is preferentially oriented with the (200) plane parallel to the growth surface when the annealing time is increased to 40 and 60 min. The present growth texture may be due to surface energy minimization with the (200) plane exhibiting a surface energy lower than the other (hkl) plane.54,55 Correlatively, a large number of Raman lines are shown in Fig. 4. A low laser power of 114 μW was used to hamper the processes of photo-induced crystallization and degradation under the laser beam.56 The Raman lines at 62 (B3g), 73 (Ag), 101 (Ag), 157 (B2g), 190 (Ag), 238 (B3g), 283 (Ag), and 314 cm−1 (Ag) correspond to the stibnite-Sb2S3 phase4,57 and their intensity strongly increased as the annealing time is increased from 30 to 40 and 60 min, which is in agreement with the XRD measurements. Also, the drastic decrease in the intensity of the Si Raman line at 521 cm−1 (ref. 58) clearly reveals that the crystallization of the Sb2S3 shell is strongly enhanced as the annealing time is increased. Importantly, no diffraction peaks corresponding to the parasitic senarmontite-Sb2O3 phase occur in the in-plane and out-of-plane configurations in Fig. 5. This is in contrast to the standard CBD and chemical spray pyrolysis techniques, where the senarmontite Sb2O3 phase has been typically reported by XRD measurements.22 However, the two Raman lines at 88 and 116 cm−1 are most likely assigned to the B2 and E phonon modes of the senarmontuite-Sb2O3 phase,59 but their intensity is low indicating that the present phase is very minor. It should be noted here that the present experimental data indicate that the SILAR technique may have some properties that improve the purity of the Sb2S3 phase, especially as compared to the CBD technique. The formation of the senarmontite-Sb2O3 phase requires the presence of oxygen, either from vacant oxygen atoms in the TiO2 shell or, more presumably, from the precursor solution. While Na2S2O3 is largely used in the CBD technique, the use of oxygen-free Na2S by the SILAR technique may be favorable to avoid the formation of the parasitic Sb2O3 phase.
Eventually, the crystallization results in a color change from light yellow with the amorphous Sb2S3 phase to dark grey with the stibnite-Sb2S3 phase. The absorption measurements of the ZnO/TiO2/Sb2S3 core–shell NW heterostructures are presented in Fig. 6a. The absorption is deduced from total transmittance measurements, the total reflectance being neglected as a first approximation since its contribution is smaller than 5% owing to the anti-reflective properties and light trapping phenomena in the ZnO NW arrays.17,18 In order to determine the band gap energy of the Sb2S3 shell, both single and double pass analyses were used as the fitting procedure for obtaining the absorption coefficient.60,61 In the single pass analysis in which the incident light propagates through the entire heterostructures while multiple reflections at the interface between the shell and substrate (i.e., TiO2 shell) as well as interferences are neglected, the absorption coefficient αSPA is given by the following expression:61 (4)where d is the thickness of the Sb2S3 shell that is equal to 20 nm as a first approximation and TS is the total transmittance.

In the double pass analysis, the incident light propagates through the entire heterostructures while the first reflection at the interface between the Sb2S3 shell and substrate (i.e., TiO2 shell) is taken into account. The absorption coefficient αDPA is given by:61 (5)where Tsub is the total transmittance of the substrate considered here as the ZnO/TiO2 core–shell NW heterostructures on the ZnO seed layer/ITO/glass.
Based on a Tauc plot61 considering that Sb2S3 is a direct band gap semiconductor, as presented in Fig. 6b, the band gap energy of the amorphous and stibnite phases is deduced as 2.16 and 1.74 eV in the double pass analysis, which is in very good agreement with the reported values in the literature.6 In contrast, the band gap energy inferred from the single pass analysis is smaller and less reliable, showing the need for the more systematic use of the double pass analysis in investigating the standard geometry of ZnO NW core–shell heterostructures.
The present findings report the formation of ZnO/TiO2/Sb2S3 core–shell NW heterostructures using chemical deposition techniques at moderate temperature and in particular the SILAR technique for the deposition of the Sb2S3 shell. Only the protective TiO2 shell is deposited by the low vacuum ALD technique, which may alternatively be replaced by spatial ALD62 or chemical spray pyrolysis63 to retain the low-cost and low-temperature approach required for industrial purposes. The present ZnO/TiO2/Sb2S3 core–shell NW heterostructures using the SILAR technique are expected to have high potential in the field of ETA solar cells.
Conclusions
In summary, we show the deposition of a Sb2S3 shell on top of ZnO/TiO2 core–shell NW heterostructures by using the SILAR technique, employing SbCl3 and Na2S as cationic and anionic precursors, respectively. The conformal anatase-TiO2 shell deposited by ALD acts as a protective layer to chemically stabilize these heterostructures in the cationic precursor solution. The Sb2S3 shell is composed of uniformly distributed clusters from the bottom to the top of these heterostructures and crystallizes into the stibnite phase following post-deposition annealing at a relatively low temperature of 250 °C. From XRD and Raman scattering measurements, we reveal that the Sb2S3 shell is of high purity with only a very minor senarmontite-Sb2O3 phase occurring, as indicated by the Raman lines at 88 and 115 cm−1 with a very low intensity. From absorption measurements, it further exhibits a relevant band gap energy of 1.74 eV derived from a Tauc plot in the framework of the double pass analysis. These findings report the advantages of the SILAR technique when the deposition is carried out over high aspect ratio nanoscale structures, which is interesting for nanoscale engineering devices.
