    , Accepted 25th August 2021First published on 25th August 2021AbstractThe realization of high-efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) relies largely on donor polymers. However, high-performance donor polymers are limited to a handful of building blocks, which usually suffer from lengthy synthesis and high production cost. Moreover, most donor polymers exhibited strong batch-to-batch variation. Herein, we report a new building block, 3-cyanothiophene (CT), which features a very simple asymmetric structure and facile synthesis. The donor polymer (PBCT-2F) based on the CT unit realized a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.1%. More importantly, PBCT-2F exhibited excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility. The six polymer batches with molecular weights ranging from 18 to 74 kDa produced very similar PCEs: 15.9–17.1% and 12.7–13.2% when the polymer was blended with Y6 and IT-4F, respectively. These results suggest the great potential of PBCT-2F for industrial synthesis and large-scale manufacturing of OSC modules. This work also demonstrates the bright future of CT units for constructing high-performance donor polymers.

Broader context
Low production cost and sufficient batch-to-batch reproducibility are essential prerequisites for scale-up synthesis of donor polymers and industrial manufacturing of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, it is challenging to develop donor polymers with high device-performance, good batch-to-batch reproducibility, and synthetic simplicity simultaneously. In this contribution we report an effective strategy to obtain high-performance donor polymers with facile synthesis and excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility by constructing an irregular conjugated backbone based on a new building block (3-cyanothiophene) with a simple asymmetric structure. A new donor polymer with a power conversion efficiency of 17.1% was demonstrated, which is among the most efficient donor polymers reported to date. Moreover, the polymer exhibited excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility in a wide molecular weight range, suggesting its great potential for scale-up synthesis and industrial manufacturing of OSC modules.

Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on a bulk-heterojunction blend of electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) are promising renewable power sources due to their advantages including low cost, light weight, and the potential for roll-to-roll fabrication on flexible substrates.1–6 Tremendous progress in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs has been achieved in the past few years, which was mainly driven by the development of non-fullerene acceptors.7–11 Donor polymers with matched energy levels, complementary light absorption, and appropriate miscibility with non-fullerene acceptors are also crucial for high-efficiency OSCs.9,12–16 Nevertheless, high-performance donor polymers are still limited due to the lack of ideal building blocks for polymer design.13,14,17 To date, the electron-rich and electron-deficient units used to construct high-performance donor polymers are predominately fluorinated benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene (BDT-2F) and benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c']dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD),12,14,18 respectively. Only a handful of donor polymers based on other building blocks can afford over 17% PCEs in OSCs (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1, ESI†).9,14,19 Besides, these building blocks and resulting polymers require lengthy synthesis and tedious purification processes, thus resulting in high production costs (Fig. S1, ESI†).20,21

Another long-standing challenge for OSCs is that the device performance severely suffers from the batch-to-batch variation of donor polymers, which is mainly caused by the inevitable fluctuations of molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI).22–30 This drawback greatly limits the up-scalability of polymer synthesis and the fabrication of large-area OSC modules reproducibly.31 For example, the two most widely used donor polymers, PM6 and PM7, can afford high-efficiency OSCs only in a very narrow Mn range (50–70 kDa).26,30,32,33 Conjugated polymers for OSCs are usually synthesized via cross-coupling polymerization such as the Suzuki and Stille reaction, which is a step-growth polymerization mechanism. Different from controlled/living chain-growth polymerization, the uncontrollable characteristic of step-growth polymerization has remained unsolved for nearly one century.34 Therefore, the precise control of molecular weight and PDI of photovoltaic conjugated polymers is almost impossible. In this context, the polymers that work well in a large Mn range is important. So far, there are very limited reports on minimizing batch-to-batch variations via device engineering including two-step sequential deposition28 and the use of special solid additives.35 However, there is no explicit strategy to guide how to reduce batch-to-batch variation of donor polymers. As for the polymer design, a feasible strategy to solve this problem is constructing irregular conjugated backbones, such as generating random copolymers (Fig. 1b). Recently, Wu et al.32 and Liang et al.33 reported several random ternary and quaternary copolymers which claimed to have small batch-to-batch variations. However, the molecular weights of various batches of these polymers were still in a narrow range. Besides, the synthesis of random ternary and quaternary copolymers needs additional monomers with respect to binary polymers, thus leading to much higher production costs. Moreover, the film morphology, and optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of random copolymers are very sensitive to the feeding ratio of the comonomers.36–40 It was also reported that conjugated polymers based on asymmetric monomers exhibited batch-to-batch insensitivity as the same subunits can be arranged in different configurations.41 The random structure caused weaker aggregation and the aggregation was less sensitive to temperature changes in solutions than regioregular polymers, which might be the reason for batch-to-batch insensitivity.42 Moreover, the asymmetric structure can not only improve the polymer solubility but also retain moderate crystallinity to ensure efficient charge transport.43,44
Our group previously reported a structurally simple building block, 3,4-dicyanothiophene (DCT) (Fig. S1, ESI†), to construct high-performance donor polymers.45–47 We have revealed that the cyano-groups are able to not only down-shift the energy levels of frontier molecular orbitals, but also to improve polymer crystallinity and interchain interaction. However, the two electron-withdrawing cyano-groups in the DCT unit caused over-aggregation of the polymers and too deep-lying frontier orbital energy levels.45,46 Herein, we report a new building block, 3-cyanothiophene (CT) (Fig. 1b), by removing one cyano-group from the DCT unit, which is also structurally simple. The synthesis of a CT-based monomer is much easier than the reported monomers based on other building blocks (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1, ESI†). Meanwhile, the negative effects associated with DCT can be overcome. Furthermore, the resulting polymers are structurally random due to the asymmetric nature of the CT unit (Fig. 1b), which will not only improve polymer solubility but also reduce batch-to-batch variations. A binary copolymer PBCT-2F (Fig. 1c) based on the CT unit was synthesized for use as an electron donor in OSCs. The polymer PBCT-2F exhibited excellent solution processability and afforded a remarkably high PCE of 17.1% when blended with the leading electron acceptor Y6. More importantly, PBCT-2F showed excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility in a wide molecular weight range. The six batches of PBCT-2F in the molecular weight range between 18 and 74 kDa produced very similar PCEs, which were 15.9–17.1% and 12.7–13.2% for two representative electron acceptors, Y6 and IT-4F, respectively. The prominent photovoltaic property and superior batch-to-batch reproducibility make PBCT-2F a promising candidate for up-scale synthesis, which is an essential prerequisite for large-scale manufacturing of OSC modules. This work also demonstrates the prospect of CT units in constructing high-performance donor polymers for OSCs.
Results and discussion
The synthetic route of PBCT-2F is shown in Fig. 1c, and detailed procedures are given in the ESI.† The CT-based dibrominated monomer (compound 4) was synthesized starting from the commercially available 3-cyanothiophene (compound 1) via only three reactions with a high yield in each step. The polymer PBCT-2F was synthesized via Stille-coupling polymerization between compound 4 and the bis(trimethyltin) BDT monomer (BDT-2F) with a high yield. Generally, the molecular weights could be controlled by changing a synthesis condition such as the catalyst, polymerization time, temperature, concentration, and stoichiometric ratio of the monomers.23,48 In this work, we obtained six polymer batches with Mn of 18, 26, 40, 57, 64, and 74 kDa by using different catalysts and tuning the polymerization time. Benefiting from the random structure of the polymer, all the polymer batches exhibited excellent solubility in common solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene. Different from the common random copolymers that were synthesized from at least three monomers, the random structure of PBCT-2F is caused by the asymmetric nature of the CT unit. Therefore, PBCT-2F is much more readily accessible than common random copolymers. Combined with the simple structure and high yield in the preparation of the CT-based monomer, PBCT-2F is a promising candidate for industrial synthesis toward large-scale manufacturing of OSC modules.
To investigate the conformational structure and molecular arrangement in the solid state, the single crystal of a CT-based terthiophene monomer (compound 4) for X-ray analysis was grown by slow diffusion of ethanol into a solution of chloroform. The crystal structure is shown Fig. 2a, and the crystal data and structure refinement parameters are presented in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†).§ There are three independent conformational molecules for compound 4. Similar to the DCT-based terthiophene monomer in our previous report,45 the thiophene units for all the conformational molecules of compound 4 are reversely arranged along the molecular axis. The dihedral angles between the thiophene rings on both sides are asymmetrical for all three conformational molecules (Fig. 2a). For two of them, one side tends to be coplanar, and the other side is slightly twisted; for the third, both sides are twisted but with even smaller torsion angles. In a unit cell, the packing mode of compound 4 is different from those of DCT-based and cyano-free terthiophene monomers.45 Three adjacent molecules form an ipsilateral π–π stacking pattern with a small slippage in a group for compound 4, and the adjacent groups form reversely alternating stacking (Fig. 2a).

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to further investigate the influence of cyano-group substitution on the molecular geometry and frontier molecular orbital of the resulting polymer by Gaussian at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), there are small torsion angles between all the adjacent thiophene rings in the main chain of PBCT-2F, which explained the weak aggregation ability and good solubility of PBCT-2F. The dihedral angle of the two thiophene rings close to the cyano-group is smaller than that of the two thiophene rings far away from the cyano-group (Fig. S2, ESI†), suggesting the existence of non-covalent interactions between the cyano-group on the central thiophene ring and the sulfur atom on the adjacent thiophene ring.45,49 Meanwhile, the thiophene rings are reversely arranged along the main chain of PBCT-2F. Based on the results of monomer single crystal structure and DFT calculations, we propose that PBCT-2F will form a pseudolinear backbone conformation (Fig. S3, ESI†), which will endow the polymer with ordered packing in the solid state and a higher light absorption coefficient.50 The wave function of HOMO was delocalized on the polymer backbone, whereas the wave function of LUMO was more localized on the CT unit, and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.28 and −2.98 eV, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†).
Thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S4, ESI†) suggested that PBCT-2F is thermally stable with a high decomposition temperature of 455 °C at 5% weight loss. In the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram, the polymer did not show a clear endothermic peak upon heating and exothermic peak upon cooling (Fig. S5, ESI†), which is similar to the benchmark donor polymer PM6 and suggests low polymer crystallinity. The UV–vis absorption spectra of PBCT-2F in chlorobenzene solution and as a thin film are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†) and Fig. 2b, respectively. The relevant numerical data are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). PBCT-2F exhibits an absorption band in the range of 300–640 nm in chlorobenzene solution, which is blue-shifted approximately 50 nm relative to the benchmark polymer PM6. Notably, the absorption shoulder peak of PBCT-2F in solution is much weaker than that of PM6, indicating the weaker aggregation degree of the former. To further compare the aggregation behaviors of the two polymers, the temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in solutions were recorded (Fig. S7, ESI†). Upon raising the solution temperature, the de-aggregation of PBCT-2F is more obvious than that of PM6 along with the disappearance of the A0–0 shoulder peak, indicating that the aggregation of PBCT-2F is more sensitive to temperature. Going from the solution to the solid state, the A0–0 shoulder peak of PBCT-2F was slightly enhanced (Fig. 2b), indicating the formation of more ordered interchain packing. The absorption onset of PBCT-2F in the film locates at 647 nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap (Eg) of 1.92 eV. The electrochemical property of PBCT-2F and PM6 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S8, ESI†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were then calculated (Fig. 2c). PBCT-2F exhibited a slightly deeper-lying HOMO level (−5.58 eV) than PM6 (−5.54 eV), which is helpful to obtain a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc). Meanwhile, there are sufficient HOMO–HOMO and LUMO–LUMO offsets between PBCT-2F and Y6 (Fig. 2d), which will guarantee efficient hole and electron transfer in OSCs.
The photovoltaic property of PBCT-2F was evaluated by blending it with Y6 in OSCs with a device architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PBCT-2F:Y6/PNDIT-F3N/Ag in which PNDIT-F3N is an n-type conjugated polyelectrolyte.51 Device optimization was conducted in terms of PBCT-2F:Y6 weight ratio, solvent, solvent additive, and thermal annealing based on the polymer batch with Mn of 64 kDa. The OSCs based on PM6 were also fabricated for comparison. The devices were tested under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimal devices are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. The device parameters are listed in Table 1, and the data acquired under various fabrication conditions are summarized in Tables S4–S7 (ESI†). The optimal OSC based on PBCT-2F afforded a prominent PCE of 17.1% along with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 27.2 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.743. This PCE is considerably higher the PCE achieved by the reference polymer PM6 (16.0%). The higher PCE of PBCT-2F benefited mainly from the higher Voc (0.85 versus 0.81 V), which is consistent with the deeper-lying HOMO energy level of PBCT-2F. The FF of the OSC made from PBCT-2F is also slightly higher (0.743 versus 0.729). The short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the OSCs based on PBCT-2F and PM6 are close, which was confirmed by the EQE spectra (Fig. 3b) where over 80% EQE in the range of 500–800 nm has been realized by both devices.
The charge transfer of the OSCs was studied by photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments (Fig. 3c). The PL quenching efficiencies of the donor polymers in the polymer:Y6 blends are 97% and 95% for PBCT-2F and PM6, respectively. The exciton dissociation probabilities P(E,T) of the OSCs based on PBCT-2F and PM6 are 97.3% and 98.0%, respectively (Fig. S9, ESI†). The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) were measured in single-carrier devices by fitting the acquired data to a space charge limited current (SCLC) model. The μh and μe for the two polymer:Y6 blends are in the same order of magnitude but are both slightly higher for the PBCT-2F:Y6 blend (Fig. 3d). Moreover, similar relationships of Jsc and Voc as a function of light intensity (Plight) were also observed for the OSCs based on PBCT-2F and PM6 (Fig. S10, ESI†). These results showed that the exciton dissociation efficiency, charge transport and recombination behaviors are all similar in the OSCs of PBCT-2F and PM6, which explained the similar Jsc and FF.

The film microstructures of the two polymers and the polymer:Y6 blends were compared using grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS).52 The two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns and the one-dimensional line-cut profiles are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The detailed parameters are collected in Table S8 (ESI†). The pure PBCT-2F film exhibited a strong (010) diffraction peak in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and (100) diffraction peak in the in-plane (IP) direction, suggesting the polymer adopts a predominant face-on orientation relative to the substrate, which is favorable for charge transport in OSCs.53–55 The (010) diffraction peak and the (100) diffraction of the pure PBCT-2F film located at 1.665 and 0.291 Å−1, corresponding to a π–π stacking distance of 3.744 Å and a lamellar distance of 21.581 Å, respectively. These results are very similar to those of the pure PM6 film. Interestingly, the PBCT-2F film exhibited higher crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) than the PM6 film for both (010) and (100) diffractions (Table S8, ESI†). Similar (010) π–π stacking distances and (100) lamellar distances were also recorded for the two polymer:Y6 blends. The PBCT-2F:Y6 blend still exhibited slightly larger (010) and (100) CCLs than the PM6:Y6 blend. These results suggest that PBCT-2F can form short-range ordered packing in the solid state even though the polymer is structurally random and shows low crystallinity as suggested by DSC measurements (Fig. S5, ESI†), which can facilitate charge transport and suppress bimolecular recombination.55

The surface and bulk morphology of the active layer were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in the AFM height image (Fig. 4c), both blends displayed a smooth surface with similar root-mean-square (RMS) roughness (1.02 nm for PBCT-2F:Y6 versus 1.03 nm for PM6:Y6). The phase separation scale of the PBCT-2F:Y6 blend is smaller than that of the PM6:Y6 blend, but the difference is small (Fig. 4d). Moreover, bicontinuous interpenetrating network structures with the formation of well-defined fibrils were observed in both blends (Fig. 4e). Such fibrillary network structures ensured efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport, and further explained the similarly high Jsc and FF of the two kinds of OSCs.
The six batches of PBCT-2F with Mn of 18, 26, 40, 57, 64, and 74 kDa were then blended with Y6 to evaluate the batch-to-batch reproducibility of the polymer. The J–V characteristics and EQEs of the OSCs are shown in Fig. 5a and b, and the detailed device parameters are summarized in Table 2. Remarkably, all the polymer batches afforded high PCEs (15.9–17.1%) with almost identical Voc (0.85–0.86 V), close Jsc (26.0–27.2 mA cm−2) and FF (0.713–0.743). In Fig. 5c we plotted the PCEs as a function of Mn of PBCT-2F together with several representative donor polymers (PM6,56 PM7,57 PBDB-T4Cl5S,29 and PBD-Cl/D18-Cl58,59) and three recently reported random copolymers (PM1,32 SZ3,33 and SZ533) which were claimed to have small batch-to-batch variations. The chemical structures of these polymers are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are gathered in Tables S9–S16 (ESI†). These reported polymers can afford high PCEs only when the molecular weight exceeds the threshold (PM6, PBD-Cl and PBDB-T4Cl5S) or is within a narrow range (PM7, PM1, SZ3, and SZ5, D18-Cl). In sharp contrast, PBCT-2F offered similarly high PCEs (15.9–17.1%) in a very large Mn range (18.0–74.0 kDa). To further confirm the batch-to-batch insensitivity of PBCT-2F, we also compared the device performance of the OSCs with IT-4F as the electron acceptor. Encouragingly, the six batches of PBCT-2F also offered very similar photovoltaic properties (Fig. 5c and Fig. S12, ESI†) with almost identical PCEs of 12.7–13.2%, Voc of 0.88–0.89 V, Jsc of 19.8–20.4 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.713–0.744 (Table S17, ESI†). These results unambiguously confirmed that PBCT-2F is indeed able to achieve high-performance OSCs reproducibly. Such eximious batch-to-batch reproducibility was rarely reported and is highly desired for industrial synthesis of photovoltaic conjugated polymers toward large-scale manufacturing of OSC modules.
The charge transport ability of a polymer with different molecular weights was investigated to understand the highly reproducible device performance of the OSCs based on PBCT-2F. In hole-only devices, the neat films of PBCT-2F with different Mn exhibited μh in a very narrow range of 5 × 10−3–6 × 10−3 cm−2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S13a, ESI†). Comparably high μh and μe were also observed in the PBCT-2F:Y6 blended films (Fig. S13b, ESI†), which explained the similar Jsc and FF of the OSCs with different batches of PBCT-2F. The polymer packing and blend morphology were further investigated to understand the similar device performance of the OSCs with different batches of PBCT-2F. The 2D-GIWAXS pattern and 1D-GIWAXS line-cut profiles of the pure polymers and polymer:Y6 blends are shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†), respectively. All six batches of PBCT-2F exhibited (010) diffraction in the OOP direction and (100) diffraction in the IP direction, suggesting the orientation of the polymer does not change with the molecular weight. Moreover, both the OOP (010) diffraction and IP (100) diffraction peaked at almost identical q values, which thereby resulted in a very similar π–π stacking distance (3.74–3.76 Å) and lamellar distance (23.0–23.5 Å). Meanwhile, the crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) of the different polymer batches are very similar for both π–π stacking (21–25 Å) and lamellar stacking (38–41 Å). In the PBCT-2F:Y6 blends, the peaks of both OOP (010) diffraction and IP (100) diffraction shifted to a slightly larger q value. However, both the π–π stacking distance (3.61–3.63 Å) and lamellar distance (22.6–23.0 Å) are very similar for all the PBCT-2F:Y6 blends. The TEM images of the various PBCT-2F:Y6 blends are shown in Fig. 6a. All the blends exhibited fibrillary interpenetrating network structures with similar phase separation scale and fibril width. Clearly, the similar polymer microstructure and BHJ morphology are the reasons for the excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility of the OSCs based on PCBT-2F with different molecular weights.

This unique characteristic makes PBCT-2F significantly different from the reported high-performance donor polymers.26,29,30,58 It was widely reported that the molecular weight of donor polymers can not only influence the polymer packing and orientation structure, but also affect the phase separation behaviors of the BHJ blends. Generally, the morphology of the BHJ blends is governed by both the mixing thermodynamics of the two components and the film-forming dynamics. The Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) was thus used to evaluate the thermodynamic miscibility between different batches of PBCT-2F and Y6 via contact angle measurements.60 For the reported high-performance donor polymers, the neat films of the polymers with different molecular weights usually exhibit different surface energy.30,58 As a result, the χ values between the donor polymer and non-fullerene acceptor usually increase with the increment of polymer molecular weight, thus leading to decreased miscibility and enhanced phase separation in the BHJ blends.26,29,30,58 But for PBCT-2F, the different batches exhibited almost identical surface energy (Fig. S15 and Table S20, ESI†). Therefore, the χ values for the various PBCT-2F:Y6 blends are almost constant (Fig. 6b and Table S20, ESI†), which agree well with the similar BHJ morphology.
The BHJ morphology can also be influenced by the solubility and aggregation degree of the polymers in the processing solvent. Too soluble polymer will cause unfavorable liquid–liquid phase separation during solution processing and lead to the formation of excessively large domain size and low domain purity, whereas an appropriate aggregation degree is needed to form proper fibrillary network structures.61,62 Generally, the polymer solubility will be decreased and the aggregation degree will be enhanced with the increase of molecular weight. For PBCT-2F, however, all six batches exhibited excellent solubility in chloroform. We compared the UV-vis absorption spectra of PBCT-2F (Fig. S16, ESI†) and an analogue of PM6 (PBDT-T4Cl5S)29 (Fig. S17, ESI†) with varied molecular weights. The aggregation degree of the polymers with different molecular weight can be evaluated by comparing the ratios between the 0–0 and 0–1 absorption peaks (Fig. 6c).63,64 PBCT-2F with different molecular weights showed almost constant 0–0/0–1 ratios in both solution and solid states, confirming that the length of the polymer chain did not affect the aggregation of the polymer. But for PBDB-T4Cl5S, the 0–0/0–1 ratios rise apparently with the increase of polymer molecular weight, indicating that the polymer has a higher aggregation degree with larger molecular weight.29 Moreover, the degree of de-aggregation with the increase of solution temperature is almost identical for PBCT-2F with different molecular weight (Fig. S18, ESI†). This behavior is greatly different from the reported polymers such as PBDB-T4Cl5S29 and PBD-Cl58 (Fig. S19, ESI†). Such close polymer solubility and aggregation degree are also the reasons for the similar BHJ morphology of the donor:acceptor blends based on PBCT-2F with different molecular weights.42,62 This feature may stem from the random structure of PBCT-2F due to the asymmetric nature of the CT unit.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we reported the development of a structurally simple unit, 3-cyanothiophene, to construct donor polymers for high-performance OSCs. Benefitting from the asymmetric nature of 3-cyanothiophene and suitable electron-withdrawing ability of the cyano-group, the resulting polymer PBCT-2F exhibited excellent solution processability, suitable aggregation degree, high charge transport ability, complementary light absorption, and ideal energy levels for matching the leading non-fullerene acceptor Y6. A prominent PCE of 17.1% was offered by the polymer, which belongs to the top level of OSCs. Moreover, PBCT-2F showed excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility in a wide molecular weight range (18–74 kDa), which has been rarely achieved by photovoltaic conjugated polymers. The prominent photovoltaic property and the superior batch-to-batch reproducibility render PBCT-2F a practical, useful polymer for OSCs. The success of PBCT-2F also provides a feasible avenue for the design of donor polymers with commercial application potential. Moreover, this work demonstrates the great potential of CT unit in OSCs. The control of regioregularity would be an effective strategy to develop more efficient donor polymers based on this unit.

Broader context
Low production cost and sufficient batch-to-batch reproducibility are essential prerequisites for scale-up synthesis of donor polymers and industrial manufacturing of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, it is challenging to develop donor polymers with high device-performance, good batch-to-batch reproducibility, and synthetic simplicity simultaneously. In this contribution we report an effective strategy to obtain high-performance donor polymers with facile synthesis and excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility by constructing an irregular conjugated backbone based on a new building block (3-cyanothiophene) with a simple asymmetric structure. A new donor polymer with a power conversion efficiency of 17.1% was demonstrated, which is among the most efficient donor polymers reported to date. Moreover, the polymer exhibited excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility in a wide molecular weight range, suggesting its great potential for scale-up synthesis and industrial manufacturing of OSC modules.

§ Crystal data for compound 4 (M = 655.59 g mol−1): triclinic, space group P (no. 2), a = 13.9722(7) Å, b = 17.5232(8) Å, c = 19.1562(9) Å, α = 94.993(4)°, β = 108.440(4)°, γ = 91.696(4)°, V = 4424.4(4) Å3, Z = 6, T = 149.98(10) K, μ(Cu Kα) = 5.603 mm−1, Dcalc = 1.476 g cm−3, 43246 reflections measured (4.888° ≤ 2Θ ≤ 134.156°), 15307 unique (Rint = 0.0891, RSigma = 0.1061) which were used in all calculations. The final R1 was 0.0857 (I > 2σ(I)) and wR2 was 0.2572 (all data). The high residual electron density (of which the largest one of 4.68 e Å−3) was due to the anomalous scattering of heavy halogen atoms, and cannot be removed by structural refinement. But the structural analysis is still acceptable for the molecular skeleton and stacking framework.
