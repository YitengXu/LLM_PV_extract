    , Accepted 18th January 2018First published on 19th January 2018AbstractFullerene derivatives are known for their excellent electron transport properties, which can effectively serve as electron transport layers (ETLs) deposited from solution at low temperatures in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, it remains unclear how functional groups attached to the fullerene derivatives influence device performances. Herein, the performance of an ETL based on [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid 2-ethylhexyl ester (PC61BEH) was investigated. It was demonstrated that the branched alkyl chain of the fullerene derivative can highly influence the solubility, film morphology, passivation ability, ETL-perovskite contact, and electron extraction ability of the fullerene derivative. Overall device performance and stability are dependent on these characteristics. The results suggest that further design and improvement of fullerene-based PSCs performance may be possible through optimization of the addend structure and functionality.
1. Introduction
Perovskites (typically CH3NH3PbI3) have become the preferred photovoltaic materials due to their exceptional properties such as high light absorption coefficients,1,2 long carrier diffusion lengths and high charge carrier mobilities.3–6 PSCs, have attracted much attention due to the rapid improvement of photoelectric conversion efficiencies and device-structure design.7–10 Inverted planar structured PSCs employing fullerene derivatives as the electron transport material (ETM) have become very popular due to their simple device architectures, low-temperature preparation processes,11,12 negligible hysteric behavior and feasible application on flexible substrates.13–15
PC61BM is the most widely used electron extraction and transport material, as well as solution processing material.8,16,17 It was first employed and verified as an efficient ETM for PSCs by Jeng and co-authors in 2013, achieving an efficiency of 3.8%.18 The efficiencies of the devices with PC61BM as the ETM were soon improved by changing the perovskite fabrication procedure, resulting in improved coverage, grain size, and a significantly increased device efficiency of 18%.19,20 Recently, Huang and co-workers demonstrated that LUMO energy dispersion in the fullerene ETL can also significantly influence the PSCs’ performance. Employing a simple annealing process for a fullerene-based ETL, a remarkable efficiency, as high as 19.4%, for inverted planar PSCs was obtained.21 At the same time, double-fullerene layers as the electron extraction and hole blocking layers in PSCs have also been studied by other groups.13,22,23 Jen et al. demonstrated that a double fullerene layer, such as PC61BM/C60 and PC61BM/bis-C60, are efficient ETLs that can enhance the electron-transporting ability and the overall device-performance.13,24–26 Other fullerene derivatives were also studied in PSCs, such as PC71BM, DMEC60 and DMEC70, among others.27–36
It is important to realize that fullerene layers in PSCs can not only serve as the ETM to extract electrons from the perovskite layer, they can also efficiently passivate the charge traps at the surfaces and grain boundaries of the perovskite layer, thus effectively eliminating electron–hole recombination events and enhancing the performance of the PSCs.17 However, the explicit influence of the functional groups of fullerene derivatives on the PSCs’ performance is still unclear and in need of investigation. Understanding these effects could lead to more effective fullerene derivative design and to better PSC devices.
Here we studied the effect of a branched alkyl chain of a PC61BM-like fullerene derivative, PC61BEH, in inverted planar PSCs using charge extraction analysis, PSCs device performance, and device stability tests to understand the effects of the functional group. Due to the high solubility of PC61BEH in chlorobenzene (146 mg mL−1 compared to PC61BM 46 mg mL−1, as determined by UV-vis), highly homogenous films, enhanced passivation, improved electron extraction ability and efficiencies as high as 16.26% were obtained from devices using PC61BEH as the ETM. This performance was better than that of PC61BM-based PSCs (15.19% PCE). Additionally, the resulting dense and hydrophobic films of PC61BEH-based devices resulted in improved device stabilities when compared with those of PC61BM based devices. These results clearly indicate that there is significant room for improvement of device performance via further design and modifications of the functional groups of fullerene derivatives.
2. Experimental and methods
Materials
PC61BM, 99%, was bought from Nano-C. PC61BEH was synthesized following the methodology developed by Hummelen et al.37 for the preparation of PC61BM. The chemical structure of PC61BEH is shown in Fig. 1a. After the compound was synthesized, it was purified by silica gel column chromatography. The final product was characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†) and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The solubilities of PC61BM and PC61BEH in chlorobenzene were obtained using a Varian Cary 5000 UV Spectrometer, constructing calibration curves at a wavelength of 434 nm, using the Lambert–Beer law (see Fig. S3, ESI†).

Device fabrication
Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was prepared following a previously reported procedure.38 PSC devices with a configuration of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM (or PC61BEH)/Al were fabricated on FTO-coated glass substrates with a resistivity of 10 Ω cm−2. The patterned FTO glass substrates were washed sequentially with detergent, deionized water, and ethanol, each step for 15 min, then, dried with nitrogen gas and finally treated in a UV–ozone oven for 20 min. After passing through a 0.45 μm PVDF filter, the PEDOT:PSS solution (Baytron P VP AI 4083) was spin-coated onto the treated FTO substrates at 5000 rpm for 30 s, and heated at 150 °C for 15 min in air. Then a solution of 1 M PbI2 in DMF was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 30 s on top of the PEDOT:PSS coated substrates, and dried on a hot plate at 70 °C for 10 min. The FTO/PEDOT:PSS/PbI2 substrates were then transferred to a vacuum oven to be converted to CH3NH3PbI3 by means of a vapor-assisted gas–solid crystallization process following previously reported methods.39,40 After the CH3NH3PbI3 films were formed they were cooled to room temperature and 2 wt% PC61BM (or PC61BEH) dissolved in chlorobenzene was spin-coated onto the CH3NH3PbI3 layer at 1200 rpm for 30 s. To complete the devices, aluminum electrodes (100 nm) were deposited by thermal evaporation under a pressure of 2 × 10−6 Torr through a shadow mask. The active area of the devices was controlled by the mask with a 7 mm2 aperture in the middle.
Device characterization
Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were measured with a Keithley 2420 source unit under a Photo Emission Tech SS100 Solar Simulator, and the light intensity was calibrated with a standard Si solar cell. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) were measured using a Bentham (from Bentham Instruments Ltd) measurement system. The light intensity was calibrated using a single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell as the reference. The J–V and EQE measurements were carried out in air. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected from a field emission scanning electron microscope (HITACHI S-4800), where the electron beam was accelerated in the range of 500 V to 20 kV. The contact angles of water droplets were determined using a Ramé-Hart model 250 goniometer using pure deionized water at room temperature at a constant volume of 5 μL. A total of ten static measurements were analyzed and averaged for each film. The steady photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using an F7000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (HITACHI), excited with a Xe lamp at 600 nm. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained on an Edinburgh instruments FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer. Atomic force microscopic (AFM) measurements of the surface morphologies of the perovskite and perovskite/fullerenes were obtained on a ND-MDT NTEGRA instrument using the tapping mode. The system was suspended on a MINUS® K stiffness vibration isolator, AFM tips from TED PELLA (Silicon Electritap 300 coated with Cr/Pt) were used in semi-contact (tapping) mode resonating at 251 kHz. Samples were scanned horizontally at 1 Hz side to side. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements were conducted in the frequency range from 4 MHz to 100 mHz for both PC61BM and PC61BEH based devices at a bias of 600 mV under dark condition.
3. Results and discussion
PC61BEH (Fig. 1a) was prepared following a previously reported procedure.37 PC61BEH has a branched alkyl chain, a 2-ethylhexyl ester group that can significantly improve the solubility of the compound,41 which ensures efficient surface perovskite coverage and higher passivation of the perovskite grain boundaries.
The energy levels of the fullerene derivatives are crucial to assess their electron extraction and hole blocking properties in PSCs. The estimated HOMO/LUMO energy values from UV-vis (Fig. S4, ESI†) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) reveal that the PC61BEH has well matched values with those of the perovskite layer. The estimated LUMO energy levels of PC61BEH and PC61BM were obtained using cyclic voltammetry (CV).42 As shown in Fig. 1b, PC61BEH exhibits three well-defined reversible reduction waves. The half-wave potentials of the fullerene derivatives are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The LUMO energy levels of the compounds were calculated from their onset reduction potentials (Eonred) using the formula LUMO energy level = −e(Eonred + 4.80) (eV).42Table 1 shows the LUMO energy levels of PC61BEH −3.89 eV. By comparing the LUMO energy values of PC61BM and PC61BEH, the results indicate that PC61BEH can serve as an efficient ETM in PSCs.17

Very similar HOMO energy values were obtained when combining the value of their maximum absorption onsets (Fig. S4, ESI†) with the LUMO energy levels. The HOMO energy levels of PC61BEH and PC61BM were estimated at −5.61 and −5.63 eV, respectively, very similar values.
To understand the influence of the 2-ethylhexyl ester group on the intrinsic properties of PC61BEH based ETM, the electron mobility was measured by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method and the Mott–Gurney law.43 Electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/Cs2CO3/fullerene derivative/Ca/Al were fabricated, and the mobilities of PC61BM and PC61BEH were determined to be 4.62 × 10−4 and 4.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, see Fig. 1c. The comparable mobility to that of PC61BM suggests that PC61BEH can work as a suitable ETM in PSCs.26
To study the ability of PC61BEH to work as an efficient ETM, inverted planar PSCs with a configuration: FTO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/fullerene/Al were fabricated. The energy-level alignment of all materials employed in the device is shown in Fig. 2a. The perovskite layer was prepared on the PEDOT:PSS coated substrate following a previously reported procedure.39 SEM images of the perovskite layers are shown in Fig. 2b and c. The top-view image (Fig. 2b) clearly shows that the perovskite layer was homogeneous and exhibits large crystalline grains without apparent pinholes. Perovskite films with larger, compact and homogeneous grains were obtained, which can effectively reduce the grain boundary and be adequate for device fabrication. From the cross-section image (Fig. 2c), the hole transporting, electron transporting and perovskite layers can be clearly distinguished. Therefore, device performance differences can be attributed to the different fullerene derivative layers, since PSCs based on PC61BM and PC61BEH were fabricated under the same conditions.

As displayed in Fig. 3a, the J–V curves of PSCs were measured under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The corresponding key parameters (VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE) of the devices are summarized in Table 2. Compared to PC61BM, PC61BEH based devices exhibit improved performances, mainly due to the higher JSC and higher FF values. Thus, the functional group on the fullerene derivative is important for the performance of the device.

Statistical histograms of the efficiencies of 20 individual devices based on PC61BM and PC61BEH as the ETMs are shown in Fig. 3c and Fig. S5 (ESI†). The average efficiencies for PC61BM and PC61BEH based devices are 14.55 ± 0.56% and 16.02 ± 0.25%, respectively.
EQE spectra of the fullerene derivative based PSCs are shown in Fig. 3b. The EQE curves for the two fullerene derivatives based devices are similar, but the EQE values of PC61BEH based devices are higher than those of PC61BM based devices, which indicates that more efficient incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies are obtained from PC61BEH based devices. PC61BEH based PSCs yielded a JSC values of 22.05 mA cm−2, higher than that of PC61BM, 21.47 mA cm−2. The calculated JSC from the EQE curves are very consistent with the values obtained from the J–V curves.
To confirm device efficiencies, the maximal steady-state power and photocurrent outputs were studied. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), PC61BM and PC61BEH based cells yielded 18.6 mA cm−2 and 19.8 mA cm−2 at 0.80 V and 0.81 V, corresponding to PCEs of 14.9% and 16.0%, respectively. The results are very similar to the values obtained from the J–V curves. The hysteresis effects of the devices were also measured. The devices based on PC61BEH as ETM displayed relatively consistent J–V curves regardless of the scan direction, indicating a better passivation effect in PC61BEH based PSCs (Fig. S7, ESI†). The results indicate that the fullerene derivatives with different functional group and solubility could affect the contact between fullerene and perovskite layer, thus affect charge traps at the fullerene/perovskite interface.
Additionally, device stabilities were conducted under a 45–50% humidity in air at room temperature without encapsulation. As displayed in Fig. 3d, PC61BEH based devices exhibit better stabilities. This can be the result of their hydrophobicity and film morphology, resulting from the branched functional group. The results also show that the functional group significantly affects the solubility compared to that of PC61BM and solution processing, thus affecting film morphology. AFM images were obtained to explore the surface morphologies of the perovskite, perovskite/PC61BM and perovskite/PC61BEH layers. As shown in Fig. 4a–d, the perovskite film exhibits a crystalline structure with a calculated root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of around 54 nm. The perovskite/PC61BM film shows a morphology with a reduced RMS roughness of around 19.3 nm, whereas an even smoother surface morphology with a smaller RMS roughness of around 13.7 nm was observed for the perovskite/PC61BEH film. The surface morphology of the PC61BEH based films is more homogenous than that of PC61BM films, likely due to better molecular packing in the PC61BEH based films. Fig. 4e and f show the water droplets on the PC61BM and PC61BEH layers and contact angle values of 81° and 97° were obtained, respectively, which must result from the more hydrophobic branched carbon chain of PC61BEH.

To further probe the influence of the functional group on the performance of PSCs, steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL and TRPL) experiments were conducted. As displayed in Fig. 5a, the steady-state PL spectra of the perovskite, perovskite/PC61BM and perovskite/PC61BEH thin films were obtained on glass substrates. A significant PL quenching effect was observed after the perovskite layer was coated with PC61BM or PC61BEH. It is clear that the perovskite layer coated with PC61BEH exhibits a more efficient PL quenching when compared to that coated with PC61BM, thus PC6BEH inhibits electron–hole recombination more efficiently.44 The TRPL spectra was obtained by monitoring the emission peak of the different fullerene derivative coated perovskite layers as a function of time. As displayed in Fig. 5b, the PC61BEH coated perovskite layer exhibits the shortest PL decay time (10.2 ns). PC61BM coated perovskite layers showed a decay time of 13.4 ns. The shorter PL decay time of the PC61BEH coated perovskite layer suggests that carriers are transferred much faster to the PC61BEH layer than to the PC61BM layer. The PL decay times are consistent with the PL quenching results, which suggests that PC61BEH has a greater ability to suppress electron–hole recombination and to significantly improve the performance of the device.44 We hypothesize that PC61BEH is better able to permeate deeper into the inter-grain boundaries due to its higher solubility and can thus better passivate these defects more efficiently. Fig. 5c is an schematic representation of the device architecture where the perovskite grain boundaries are passivated by PC61BEH.13 Xu et al. reported that charge trap passivation results from the formation of PC61BM-halide radicals.45 However, it remains unclear how fullerenes passivate charge traps on perovskite surfaces, or what is the role of the fullerene's addend.

Finally, the charge transfer processes at the perovskite/fullerene interface were studied by EIS measurements. Results obtained for Perovskite/PC61BM and perovskite/PC61BEH were fit to a relatively simple equivalent circuit (Fig. 6) consisting of a contact resistance (Rct) between the fullerene/perovskite or perovskite/PEDOT:PSS interface and the recombination resistance (Rrec). As shown in the Nyquist plots in Fig. 6 and Table S2 (ESI†), PC61BEH based devices display a lower Rct and larger Rrec values than those devices based on PC61BM. Since the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface is identical in both cases,46 the results demonstrate that electron extraction is more efficient at the perovskite/PC61BEH interface than that for perovskite/PC61BM. It is also clear that PC61BEH can inhibit charge recombination more efficiently than PC61BM at the perovskite/fullerene interface. The decreased charge recombination efficiency at the perovskite/PC61BEH interface indicates that PC61BEH passivates the charge traps more efficient than PC61BM. This result is consistent with the higher PL quenching observed for perovskite/PC61BEH devices.

4. Conclusions
In this work, PC61BEH with a branched alkyl chain was synthesized and used as an efficient ETM in PSCs. The effect of the fullerene addend on the PSCs performance was systematically explored by AFM film morphology, SCLC, PL, TRPL, EIS and device performance studies. The improved efficiency and stability of PC61BEH based devices can be attributed to the presence of the branched group that enhances solubility, improves film morphology, and increases both passivation and electron extraction ability compared to PC61BM based devices. Given that the only difference between these two compounds is their solubility, we speculate that the higher solubility enhances the penetration of the compound into the intergrain spaces in the perovskite film, thus passivating the charge traps and facilitating the charge mobilities. These results indicate that further optimization of the functional group of fullerene derivatives could result in improved device performances.
