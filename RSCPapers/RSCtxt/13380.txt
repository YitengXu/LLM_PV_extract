    , Accepted 5th October 2016First published on 5th October 2016AbstractAs the most prevalently used fullerene-based electron acceptor in organic–inorganic solar cells, [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) was isolated into three typical isomers of α-, β1- and β2-PC71BM with comparable molecular orbital energy levels for exemplifying a formulation engineering based on blending the three isomers to improve photovoltaic performance. The power conversion efficiency (PCE), photocurrent hysteresis and stability of planar heterojunction perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) solar cells have been optimized by formulation engineering with mixed PC71BM (α:β1:β2 = 17:1:2), the specific mixture which represents the best electron acceptor superior to either each of the purified isomers or any other ternary isomers of PC71BM. Microscopic analyses support that molecular aggregation of the isomeric PC71BM was critical to influence the surface morphology and, in turn, the PCE in the range of 0.38–17.56% of the perovskite solar cells involved. This finding about isomer-dependent photovoltaic performance launches a heretofore unknown strategy of formulation engineering for making efficient electron acceptors by mixing various fullerene derivatives having isomeric structures or beyond.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic solar cells such as perovskite solar cells represent one of the most promising energy renewables in the future.1–7 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–inorganic solar cells has been improved rapidly in recent years,1,8–15 but their stability is poor partly subject to improvement by the electron acceptors involved.15–23 Although a number of non-fullerene electron acceptors have recently been reported,24–29 the fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) is still an important electron acceptor widely used simply because it is a important molecule with lower reorganization energy and appropriate molecular orbital energy compatible with almost all the currently available electron donors applicable in efficient organic/polymer solar cells30–38 and perovskite solar cells.15–22 However, the commercially available PC71BM is a “random” mixture of PC71BM isomers32 that are synthesized by traditional chemical methods in which the reactions unavoidably take place at different reactive sites39 of C70 to typically produce isomers of α-, β1- and β2-PC71BM in an “unsteady” proportion (Fig. 1). Due to extreme difficulties in isolation of PC71BM isomers with nearly identical structures, the efforts to separate both of β isomers are fruitless to date.

Here we show a practical method called formulation engineering for optimizing the “unsteady” PC71BM as the best fullerene-based electron acceptor. Taking a planar heterojunction perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) solar cell as an example, PCE can be tailored in the wide range of 0.38–17.56% depending on the ternary composition of isomeric PC71BM. Of interest is that only the purified isomer, no matter which of α-, β1- or β2-PC71BM, has resulted in a poorer film of the electron acceptor layer with discontinuous microcrystalline and, in turn, poor photovoltaic performance of the corresponding devices. A mixture of the three isomers of PC71BM at a ratio of 17:1:2 (α:β1:β2) stands out with higher PCE and less photocurrent hysteresis. Isomeric fullerene derivatives such as α-, β1- or β2-PC71BM, having comparable molecular orbital energy levels, e.g., LUMO energy, bandgaps and UV-vis absorption, are thus established as the ideal starting materials for formulation engineering to optimize fullerene-based electron acceptors. Such formulation engineering is highly expected to extend as a routine approach for improving the photovoltaic performance of next generation organic–inorganic solar cells with fullerene-based electron acceptors by utilizing numerous currently available fullerene derivatives, especially isomeric fullerene derivatives.
With isomeric structures and similar electronic properties, isomers of individual fullerene derivatives have been thought to show comparable or slightly different photovoltaic performances, as observed for previously reported several isomers of fullerene bisadducts (e.g., indene- and dihydronaphthyl-C60 bisadducts and bis-PC71BM) as well as for very recently reported C70 monoadducts (e.g., α-PC71BM)40 on mixing with donor materials in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells.37,38,40–45 However, the amount of isolated isomers of fullerene bisadducts is less than 10% of possible isomers for each of the indene- and dihydronaphthyl-C60 bisadducts as well as for bis-PC71BM. Moreover, both β1- and β2-PC71BM fail to be separated.40 As all the previously reported isomers were structurally incomplete and unavoidably influenced by the extra donor materials involved in organic solar cells, the isomeric effects of fullerene-based electron acceptors were apparently underrated and subsequently led to a somewhat contradiction in isomer-dependent photovoltaic performance (some of the studies40,42,43 concluded that purified isomers showed superior performance to pristine mixtures, whereas others45 draw a different conclusion). Such a contradiction may imply that the effects of isomeric fullerenes on photovoltaic performance are complex due to mixing with donor-acceptors. The pioneers paid no attention to changing of photovoltaic performance with the ternary proportion of isomeric fullerene derivatives, different from our present contribution focusing on formulation engineering for optimizing the current most efficient electron acceptor.
2. Results and discussion
The PC71BM isomer mixture was synthesized by a traditional organic method according to previous literature.32 Three typical isomers, α-PC71BM, β1-PC71BM, and β2-PC71BM, were produced in a yield depending on reaction conditions. Among them α-PC71BM was formed if [3 + 2] cycloaddition occurs at the α bond of C70,39 while the other two stereoisomers (β1-PC71BM and β2-PC71BM) were yielded if [3 + 2] cycloaddition occurs at the β bond of C70 (Fig. 1b). Detailed procedures of purifying α-PC71BM (99.9%), β1-PC71BM (99.9%) and β2-PC71BM (99.9%) by recycling high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are reported elsewhere.46 The 1H NMR spectra, 13C NMR spectra, mass spectra and UV-vis spectra of α-, β1- and β2-PC71BM are displayed in ESI Fig. S1–S10,† establishing the isomeric structures and comparable bandgaps as well as the high purities of the isolated PC71BM isomers.
The electrochemical properties of PC71BM isomers were measured by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S11, Table S1, ESI†). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the PC71BM isomers were estimated from their reduction onset potentials (Eonred).47 The LUMO energy levels of α-, β1- and β2-PC71BM isomers were estimated to be −3.87, −3.87 and −3.88 eV, respectively. As shown, the LUMO energy levels of PC71BM isomers match well with the conduction band of CH3NH3PbI3,48 implying that they are viable electron acceptors for perovskite solar cells. It is reasonable to speculate that the almost identical levels of LUMO energy as well as bandgaps are appropriate for the starting materials useful in the formulation engineering, and isomeric fullerene derivatives with comparable molecular orbital energy levels should thereby be the ideal starting materials for formulation engineering to optimize fullerene-based electron acceptors. Consequently the strategy of formulation engineering is expected to be extended to numerous fullerene derivatives such as other isolatable isomers.40–45
Perovskite solar cells employing CH3NH3PbI3 as the light absorber, PC71BM isomer(s) as the electron acceptor/conductor, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) as the hole conductor were fabricated with an inverted planar device configuration (FTO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PC71BM/Al, as shown in Fig. 1). The CH3NH3PbI3 film was prepared by following the vapor-assisted solution procedure with some modification.49 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern is shown in Fig. S12,† where PbI2 diffraction peaks are missing in the CH3NH3PbI3 film implying complete transformation of PbI2 into CH3NH3PbI3. As shown in Fig. S13a,† large grain size and pinhole-free CH3NH3PbI3 films were formed. As the electron acceptors, PC71BM isomers with different ratios mentioned below were deposited onto the CH3NH3PbI3 layer by spin-coating with an optimized thickness of ∼80 nm. Finally, the Al electrode was thermally evaporated. The cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the optimal devices are shown in Fig. S13b.† The SEM images show that the thickness of the perovskite layer, the PC71BM layer, and the electrode Al is about 270, 80, and 100 nm, respectively.
Three purified isomers of PC71BM (α-, β1-, and β2-PC71BM) in the designed proportion (vide infra) were introduced as the electron acceptors in the perovskite solar cells. The device with the pure α-PC71BM isomer exhibited a short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of 19.70 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.87 V, a fill factor (FF) of 54.72%, and a PCE of 9.37% (note that all the data discussed in this contribution are the best results among repeated experiments unless otherwise stated), whereas each of the purified β1-PC71BM- and β2-PC71BM-involving devices (β1-PC71BM-device and β2-PC71BM-device) showed rather low PCEs (0.38% and 3.70%) with extremely low Jsc and FF. The three isomers were mixed together in a 1:1:1 ratio to result in a PCE of 7.83% (Voc = 0.77 V, Jsc = 18.69 mA cm−2, and FF = 54.75%). Among the α-, β1- and β2-PC71BM, by mixing any two isomers together at a ratio of 1:1, different PCEs (4.76% for α:β1, 4.19% for β1:β2, and 9.79% for α:β2) were obtained. These results implied that the photovoltaic performance could be tuned by the mixture composition of PC71BM isomers. Encouraged by this guideline, more formulations (shown in Fig. 2a and ESI Table S2†) starting from the three isomeric PC71BM were made to fabricate planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. As shown in Fig. 2b and c, the α-β1-β2 triangle “phase diagrams” of both best-performing and average-performing PCEs for the perovskite solar cells with the electron acceptors of PC71BM isomers at different formulations were plotted in trigonometric coordinates. The data of Voc, Jsc, FF, and the highest PCE are summarized in ESI Table S2.† Overall, the PCEs on the right side of the “phase diagram” are higher than those on the left side, and the PCE values over 10% are concentrated around the position with the formulation of α:β1:β2 = 7:1:1, close to the top of the triangle on the “phase diagram”. The highest PCE of 17.56% (Voc = 0.952 V, Jsc = 23.37 mA cm−2, and FF = 78.96%) is located at the 17:1:2 position of the diagram, making α:β1:β2 = 17:1:2 the best electron acceptor.

With isomeric structures and similar electronic properties, individual isomers of fullerene derivatives have long been thought to show comparable photovoltaic performance to each other. Our experiment reveals a stark difference of power conversion efficiency (PCE = 0.38, 3.7, or 9.37%) for the perovskite solar cells with each of the purified α-, β1- or β2-PC71BM isomer as the electron acceptor, which is obviously against the traditional logic and reflects the validity of formulation engineering based on the mixture of isomeric fullerene derivatives having comparable electronic properties.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the perovskite solar cells at the typical PC71BM isomer formulations (α:β1:β2 = 1:0:0, 0:1:0, 0:0:1, 1:1:1, and 17:1:2), under simulated AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2 solar irradiation, are displayed in Fig. 2d. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are displayed in Fig. 2e. The integrated Jsc value from the EQE curve is consistent with the measured Jsc value from the J–V curves within 3% difference. The stabilities of each of the pure isomers or the optimal α:β1:β2 = 17:1:2 PC71BM-involving device were also tested and the results are shown in Fig. S14.† The PCEs of the α-PC71BM device, β1-PC71BM device and β2-PC71BM device decayed over 90% within 50 h in a glovebox, while the α:β1:β2 = 17:1:2 device only lost about 10% of the PCE after 50 h. These results clearly demonstrate that the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells can be tuned by formulation engineering of PC71BM isomers. The present photovoltaic performance is slightly poorer than those recently reported,13–15 but it can be further improved if the technology for preparing state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells is updated.
To study the hysteresis effects of devices using PC71BM isomers as electron acceptors at the best formulation (α:β1:β2 = 17:1:2), the J–V characteristics of devices at different scan directions and diverse delay times were also evaluated (Fig. S15 and S16, ESI†). Less hysteresis effects were observed in the devices with PC71BM isomers at the best formulation, which is in good agreement with previous literature about less hysteresis shown for fullerene-involving perovskite solar cells.19–21,50 As shown in Fig. 2f, the satisfactory PCE reproducibility of the solar cells at the optimal formulation was also measured by using 30 different cells. With an average of 16.44%, the PCE fluctuated within a limited range.
To explore the reason why the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells is so sensitive to the ratios of three PC71BM isomers, the surface morphology of the PC71BM isomer layer was studied by using a polarized optical microscope. As shown in Fig. 3, the α:β1:β2 = 17:1:2 film was very smooth where no obvious aggregations can be observed. The β1-PC71BM-only film, β2-PC71BM-only film, α:β1:β2 = 1:4:1 film, α:β1:β2 = 1:1:4 film, α:β1:β2 = 2:5:5 film, and the β1:β2 = 1:1 film suffered from serious aggregations of fullerene derivatives. As a result, the large fullerene aggregations lead to the poor morphology of the electron transport layer, which could decrease the contact interface between the electrode and electron acceptor layer, resulting in low Jsc, FF and PCE. Overall, the decreasing order of the PCEs is well consistent with the trend of the PC71BM isomer layer roughness, implying that the surface morphology of the self-assembled electron acceptor layer of PC71BM isomers plays an essential role in the photovoltaic performance of fullerene-involving perovskite solar cells.

To gain a deeper insight into the relationship between the molecular aggregations and the isomeric structures, SEM was used to study the α-PC71BM-only film, β1-PC71BM-only film, and β2-PC71BM-only film, as well as the α:β1:β2 = 17:1:2 film. As shown in Fig. 4, the three isomers displayed different nature of self-aggregation. The β1-PC71BM-only film exhibited solid self-aggregation into micro-balls (Fig. 4d–f) and the β2-PC71BM-only film showed a clear crystalline-like structure with self-aggregation into alignment of thin slices (Fig. 4g–i), whereas the α-PC71BM-only film presented an amorphous-like state with loose self-aggregation (Fig. 4a–c) (note that the α-PC71BM is intrinsically chiral and enantioseparation51 for an insight into self-aggregation of the chiral PC71BM molecule is still underway). Obviously the aggregated solids of α-, β1- or β2-PC71BM isomers are susceptible to the influence of isomeric formulation, for example, with the optimal ratio of α:β1:β2 = 17:1:2 as displayed in Fig. 4j–l. In accordance with the SEM images, starkly different films between purified and mixed isomeric PC71BM were confirmed by atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements (Fig. S17, ESI†).

To investigate the electron transfer between the perovskite light absorber and the PC71BM isomers, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed for the samples with α-PC71BM, β1-PC71BM and β2-PC71BM, or the mixture of the three isomers (α:β1:β2 = 17:1:2) deposited on the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 layer. As shown in Fig. 5a, the steady-state PL intensity of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 is obviously quenched in the PC71BM isomer deposition, clearly indicating effective electron transfer from perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 to the nanomolecular isomers. The quenching efficiency of the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 film with the isomeric mixture (α:β1:β2 = 17:1:2) is significantly higher than any of α-PC71BM, β1-PC71BM or β2-PC71BM, though quantitative data of the transformation degree are hard to obtain because the PL of the perovskite light absorber is susceptible to the measurement conditions.

To further scrutinize the factors responsible for photovoltaic performance, the electron mobility of α-PC71BM, β1-PC71BM, β2-PC71BM, and the mixture of the three isomers (α:β1:β2 = 17:1:2) was evaluated by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method52 (Fig. 5b). The electron mobilities of β1-PC71BM (1.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and β2-PC71BM (1.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) are close to each other, whereas the electron mobility of α-PC71BM (2.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), similar to that of the mixture of the three isomers (α:β1:β2 = 17:1:2) (2.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), is slightly higher than those of β1-PC71BM and β2-PC71BM. Such a slight difference in the electron mobility is not necessarily responsible for the strikingly different photovoltaic performances (0.38–17.56%) in the perovskite solar cells based on α-, β1-, β2- and α:β1:β2-PC71BM.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we propose a concept about formulation engineering for optimizing excellent electron acceptors to fabricate reproducible perovskite solar cells with high performance and less hysteresis. Based on successful isolation of three main isomers of PC71BM (i.e., α-, β1- and β2-PC71BM with similar electronic properties), different ternary compositions of PC71BM isomers were blended as the electron acceptors to fabricate perovskite solar cells. A meaningful “phase diagram” of PCEs vs. formulation of PC71BM isomers was plotted in trigonometric coordinates, and the higher PCE with good reproducibility was achieved by using the isomeric PC71BM mixture around α:β1:β2 = 17:1:2 as the electron acceptor. Supported by optical and electronic microscopies as well as PL measurements, it is demonstrated that the molecular aggregation and electron transfer involved in the electron acceptor layer are dependent on the composition of PC71BM isomers. The present work, concerning a practical strategy of formulation engineering, is expected to attract both scientific and technologic attention for optimizing the best electron acceptor in efficient and reproducible organic–inorganic solar cells.

4.3. Device fabrication and characterization
Inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells with a configuration of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PC71BM isomers/Al were fabricated. A patterned FTO glass substrate was cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. The dried FTO glass was treated in a UV ozone chamber for 10 min prior to spin-coating a thin (∼30 nm) PEDOT:PSS layer at 2000 rpm for 35 s. The substrate was baked at 150 °C for 20 min in air and then moved into a glovebox filled with N2 gas for fabricating the photoactive layer. A solution of 450 mg mL−1 PbI2 in DMF was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer at 5000 rpm for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing at 70 °C for 20 min. The dry PbI2 substrate was moved into a vacuum oven and heated at 150 °C for 3 h with CH3NH3I powder spread around. A dark brown mirror-like perovskite layer was formed during this process. PC71BM isomers of different ratios were dissolved in chlorobenzene (30 mg mL−1). After stirring at 45 °C for 1 h, the solution of PC71BM isomers was deposited onto the FTO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite substrates by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a cathode of ∼100 nm Al was thermally evaporated through a shadow mask at a base pressure of ∼2 × 10−4 Pa.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by using a Merlin lock-in amplifier coupled with a CS260 monochromator and a 300 W xenon lamp (note that in rare cases the EQE measurement is susceptible to the quality of FTO glass). Jsc values obtained by integrating the product of the EQE with the AM 1.5G solar spectrum agreed with the measured value within 3%. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell. The reference cell with dimensions of 2 × 2 cm was calibrated by the Newport Corporation. The J–V curves were measured using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel, 91195A) with a scan speed of 120 mV s−1 and a dwell time of 0.5 s, and a source meter (Keithley 2420) under the illumination of AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2. The dimensions of the tested solar cells defined by the intersection of the FTO anode and Al cathode were 0.16 cm2, but all the measurements were conducted by using a mask with an aperture of 0.06 cm2 to define the active area of the device. All the devices were characterized in air (humidity ranging from 40% to 50% and temperature ∼20 °C). The measurement of electron mobility was conducted in the dark by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method on a computer-controlled Keithley 2420 sourcemeter for the electron-only devices. Electron-only devices with the structure FTO/titanium (diisopropoxide) bis(2,4-pentanedionate) (TIPD)/fullerene/TIPD/Al were fabricated by spin-coating the fullerene layer on FTO/TIPD substrates followed by deposition of TIPD/Al on the cathode electrode.54 The thickness of the fullerene layer is around 80 nm. The conventional XRD measurements were conducted using Rigaku Ultima IV XRD equipment. The SEM image was obtained from a field emission scanning electron microscope (HITACHI S-4800). The AFM images of PC71BM isomer films were obtained from a Seiko SPA-400 AFM with a Seiko SPI-3800N Abetz probe station at room temperature in tapping mode. The optical microscope images were taken on a polarized optical microscope OLYMPUS BX51. Steady-state PL spectra were recorded on an F7000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (HITACHI), excited with a Xe lamp at 516 nm, for FTO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3 substrates without an Al electrode under a nitrogen atmosphere.
