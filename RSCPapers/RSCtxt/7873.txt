    , Accepted 23rd August 2022First published on 26th August 2022AbstractAs a post-graphene two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterial with unique properties, the potential of black phosphorus (BP) has been extended to various applications. However, pristine BP nanosheets are still facing huge challenges when applied in real devices, especially the concerns about ambient instability. It is necessary to treat BP with further modification in order to overcome the limitations. On the other hand, these 2D materials inherently take the structural advantage to become building blocks of composites. Consequently, plenty of BP-based composites have been designed. Amongst, combining BP with metal-based materials is a rather effective and efficient functionalization strategy. Due to the strong affinity between BP and metal ions/adatoms, there are intense interactions and synergistic effects within the BP–metal-based nanocomposites (BP–Ms). With careful design and control, the BP–Ms could present much better performances in applications that transcend both 2D BP and metal constituents. This review is aimed to give a general summary of the advancements of BP–Ms in different applications, with discussions about the challenges and prospects of this novel composite material.
1. Introduction
As the most stable allotrope of phosphorus, black phosphorus (BP) has achieved an unparalleled renaissance in research and application since its participation in two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials.1 Similar to other van der Waals (vdW) substances, e.g., graphite, BP could be exfoliated into few-layer or even monolayer elemental nanosheets (phosphorene), presenting distinguished properties compared to the bulk form.2 The BP nanosheets demonstrate various exceptional capabilities, such as tunable band gaps (correlated to the layer numbers), high carrier mobility (μ = 300–1000 cm2 V−1 S−1), strong in-plane anisotropy, photothermal conversion ability, biocompatibility, and biodegradability.3 These unique properties of BP make it a highly promising 2D material, which could replace or surpass graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in many fields.4 The potential applications of BP in catalysis, energy storage, electronics, biomedicine, and sensors have been extensively studied.5–13
Despite the thriving of BP in various research areas, an unavoidable issue is the instability of BP nanosheets.14,15 Under ambient conditions (water vapor, oxygen, and light), the BP nanosheets irreversibly degrade into phosphate compounds.16 This fast degradation is a significant limitation for BP in many circumstances; thus, protection strategies are required, such as encapsulation, chemical passivation, or functionalization.17–20 Because the functionalization of BP is also suitable for property modifications, the correlated studies have flourished in the last few years. To date, BP has been functionalized with metal-based materials, carbon materials, organic molecules, or polymers.21 Among these hybrid materials, the most charming combinations are the BP–metal-based composites (BP–Ms). The metal component of the composites can be metals, metal oxides, or other metallic compounds. These metal components are utterly dissimilar to BP, leading to a metal-nonmetal contact, and thus the cooperation offers the advantages of creating improved or novel functionalities that are missing in the single material. Different from graphene, phosphorene has a wrinkled surface constructed by zigzag P atoms. The metal atoms/ions are bound to interact with phosphorene deeper and more pluralistic than the flattened graphene. Also, the lone pair electrons on the BP surface (Lewis base) could attract metal ions (Lewis acid) based on the Lewis acid–base theory.22,23 The metal ions thus could immobilize the lone pair electrons from reacting with oxygen molecules and influence the electronic structure of BP. Eventually, the functionalized BP–Ms could maintain relatively high stability and simultaneously provide tailor-made properties, which are more suitable for various applications.24
In general, the interactions and synergistic effects within BP–Ms are diverse and complex, rendering tremendous changes in physical and chemical properties, such as electrical and thermal conductivities, light absorbance capability, magnetism, and absorptive selectivity.25–29 All these improvements demonstrate win–win cooperation between BP and the metal components. As an attractive novel kind of material, the number of theoretical studies and practical applications of BP–Ms has increased sharply in recent years. Several reviews have discussed BP and BP comprised composites for different applications, and a recent review summarized the BP–carbon composites.24,30,31 However, there is no review article systematically summarizing BP–Ms and their applications. Here, we will focus on the interactions between BP and metal materials to discuss the properties, classifications, synthesis methods, and applications of BP–Ms based on recent achievements. We hope this brief review specific to BP–Ms could provide a more comprehensive understanding of this kind of hybrid materials and ignite more novel ideas to design and utilize BP–Ms for various research and applications.
2. Structure and properties of BP
The bulk BP was accidently found in 1914 and did not attract much attention until the 2D phosphorene was reported in 2014.33 Since then, the atomic structure of BP has been thoroughly studied by theoretical and experimental approaches.34,35 Here, a short and brief introduction of the BP structure and properties will be given. As shown in Fig. 1a, the orthorhombic BP shows a layered crystal structure and these stacked layers are connected by relatively weak vdW interactions, with the calculated interlayer distance to be ∼5.3 Å. Unlike graphene with a flattened planar structure, the monolayer of BP presents a puckered honeycomb structure, see Fig. 1b. Each phosphorus atom covalently bonds with three adjacent phosphorus atoms through sp3 hybridization, with two different bond angles (96.3° and 102.1°) and bond lengths (2.224 Å and 2.244 Å), forming an anisotropic in-plane structure. This anisotropy in structure not only differentiates BP from most of other 2D materials, but also results in the unique anisotropy relating to its electrical, optical, mechanical, and thermal properties.

As shown in Fig. 1c, BP is a direct band gap semiconductor. The value of the band gap increases when the number of layers decreases due to the quantum confinement effects.36 When it comes to electronic applications, it is necessary to tune the band gap of the materials so as to increase carrier mobility or enhance emission efficiency. For BP, various tuning strategies could be applied, such as layer number modulation, strain engineering, external electric field, defect introduction, and functionalization.37–41 Besides the sizable band gap, another unique electronic property of BP is the high carrier mobility, and these two properties are often mutually exclusive in other 2D materials. For example, the MoS2 nanosheet has a finite band gap but low mobility, and the graphene has high electron mobility but no band gap.
Apart from the distinctive geometric and electronic properties, another noteworthy characteristic of BP is the lone pair electrons.35 The valence shell electronic configuration of phosphorus in BP is 3s23p3, which means there are five electrons available for bonding in each phosphorus atom. Thus, apart from the three electrons involved in the sp3 hybridization, each P atom in BP has unshared pair of electrons. The active lone pair electrons are the main factors for the instability of BP nanosheets, yet they also play a significant role in the subsequent applications of BP. Particularly, the lone pair electrons facilitate the functionalization of BP with metal materials, which will be further discussed in the following section.
3. Different types of BP–Ms and interactions
Though the BP–Ms are still in a developing stage, with a countable number of practical examples, when it comes to classification, it is still controversial to find a specific sorting scheme for these materials. The classification regime is significant for understanding the inner characteristics of BP–Ms. First, we sorted the BP–Ms according to the metals, as shown in Table 1. From the table, it is hard to see if there is any priority for certain metals in the BP–Ms, which is consistent with the great affinity of BP towards most metals. However, the interactions of BP and metal within different BP–Ms are varied. In order to provide a more systematic introduction to BP–Ms, here, we will conduct the discussion based on the functionalization types, namely, physical functionalization, surface covalent hybridization, and substitutional doping. Notably, in some circumstances, there could simultaneously exist multiple functionalization types. The interactions between BP and the metal components are different, corresponding to the three functionalization types, showing an escalating trend. Thereinto, the covalent hybridization is most common in practical instances, resulting in a bunch of interactions that are fundamental for property modulations and subsequent applications of BP–Ms.

3.1 Physical functionalization
The physical functionalization type of BP–Ms refers to the combination of BP and metal components through mere adsorption without any chemical bonds, which could also be named non-covalent functionalization. As a 2D nanostructure, BP nanosheets have a large surface to volume ratio, leading to high surface energy. The high surface energy can serve as the driving force to overcome the entropy penalty by the assembly process of composites.108 Low-dimensional nanostructures tend to adhere spontaneously to the surface of BP nanosheets. However, this van der Waal force induced adhesion has limitations on the size and number of attachments, and usually, only metal atoms/ions, nanodots, and small nanoparticles are suitable in this situation. In order to realize stronger adsorption, extra treatment steps are required, for example, electrostatic modification. As the saying goes, without destruction, there is no construction. Though the physical functionalization maintains the structure and properties of BP to the maximum extent, it also results in a relatively weak interaction between the metals and BP, and it is hard to bring any new characteristics or synergistic effects. In many biomedical applications, physical functionalization would be preferred to synthesize BP–Ms. BP and the metal part each act individually, building a multi-functional nanodevice.
3.2 Surface covalent hybridization
Actually, due to the strong affinity between metal ions and BP, covalent hybridization is more often to happen. According to the Lewis' theory of acids and bases, there is an inherently strong affinity between metal ions (Lewis acid) and lone pair electrons in BP (Lewis base). The binding (adsorption) energies of various metal adatoms on BP are typically more than twice larger than those on graphene, which could be calculated by theoretical simulations. Atomically, there are four kinds of adsorption sites on the surface of BP, as illustrated in Fig. 2a, and most metal atoms prefer the H site.35 The adsorption energies of different metal atoms on the H site are shown in Fig. 2b. The difference in the bonding ability of metals to BP can be related to their electronic structure. Ag and Au have d-bands that are fully filled and do not cross the Fermi level, leading to weak adsorption energy. These metals tend to physically functionalize with BP, as discussed in the prior section. On the other hand, Pd, Pt, Ti, and Ni could actively react with BP according to the value of the adsorption energies. Particularly, after chemical bonding with BP, the sp-bands of Pd, Pt, and Ni become partially filled at the cost of the d-band occupancy. The strong affinity gives rise to covalent bonds between the metal and phosphorus atoms, which could be quantified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), or Raman characterizations. An experimental example was that in the composite of titanium sulfonic ligand and BP (TiL4@BP), the Ti–P bonds were formed in which the lone pair electrons on the BP surface interact with the 3d empty orbital of Ti.52 The electrochemical interactions in the BP/metal interfaces have several influences on the properties of the BP–Ms formed by covalent hybridization:
 Fig. 2  (a) Typical adatom adsorption sites on phosphorene. (b) Adsorption energy of alkali metals (from Li to K, black circles), noble metals (from Ag to Pt, red squares), 3d transition metals (from Ti to Ni, blue diamonds) and non-metallic (Si, Ge, green triangles) adatoms on phosphorene.

(1) The electronic structure modulation. The electron migration in covalent bonding leads to the change of the band gap of BP and the Fermi level of metals. BP nanosheets with different layer numbers have different band gaps, from 2 eV (monolayer) to 0.3 eV (bulk). The influence of metal bonding could further control the band gap of BP for preparing more suitable BP-based materials used in photovoltaic and electronic devices. On the other hand, the Fermi level change of metals could lead to the work function change, eventually affecting the redox ability of the composites. These electronic structure alterations also have some overall impacts, such as increased carrier mobility and elevated electric conductivity.
(2) The adsorption ability changes. The covalent bonds between metals and BP subsequently affect the coordination environment of each component, resulting in the adsorption ability change of the whole composite to different molecules. This is similar to the interaction between metals and P atoms in phosphides, which is considered to be an ensemble effect.109 As a matter of fact, the ensemble effect is significant for designing composite catalysts.
(3) The stability enhancement. According to previous research, the oxygen molecule is a potent electron scavenger that activates the lone pair electrons of BP to the 2π* antibonding orbitals of the oxygen molecule.110 This process eventually results in the oxidation and degradation of BP. While in BP–Ms, since the lone pair electrons participate in covalent bonding, the stability of BP could be greatly enhanced.
In addition, there are some specific interactions in the covalent hybridization type of BP–Ms, corresponding to the applications. Discussing and analysing these interactions could provide reasonable mechanical explanations for performance improvements of BP–Ms.
3.3 Substitutional doping
In substitutional doping, the metal atoms would be incorporated into the crystal lattice of BP to replace the P atoms. While the physical functionalization and the covalent hybridization are associated with interfaces, doping is more of an “internal digestion”. The doping of metals generally causes structural mismatch, generating defect sites in BP. Therefore, the metal-doped BP nanosheets are significantly more reactive than the pristine state. Till now, most of the metal-doped BP were studied by theoretical simulations, with single atom doping in monolayer phosphorene.111 These theoretical findings could give guidelines for future practical designs, cutting down unnecessary trials. For instance, the strong electron–phonon coupling at the doping level of 1/8 of BP monolayer with lithium atoms could eventually lead to a superconducting phase.112 The substitutional doping of Fe, Co, and Ni resulted in similar property changes, except that the co-doped phosphorene showed no magnetic state while the Fe and Ni doping induced magnetic moments to phosphorene.113,114 The Pt doping had low formation energy (consistent with the high adsorption energy), and the Pt-doped BP adsorbed the NO and CO molecules slightly stronger than the pristine phosphorene.115
A brief comparison of the above mentioned three types of BP–Ms is conducted in Table 2, with their advantages, potential problems, and related applications.

4. Synthesis methods for BP–Ms
The vulnerability of BP nanosheets to water, oxygen, and temperature provides great limitations on the conditions for the synthesis of BP–Ms. Until now, there are mainly a few types of synthesis methods for this kind of hybrid materials.
4.1 Wet physical methods
First is the convenient wet solution assembly method at room temperature. The essential step of this method is mixing and stirring (or ultrasonic mixing) the pre-prepared metal building blocks with BP nanosheets for hours in organic solvents like N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), tetrahydrofuran (THF), or absolute ethanol.52,65,74 Then, the mixture would self-assemble into composites. Usually, the metal building blocks would be small metal nanoparticles, which are easier to attach to the BP surface, as demonstrated in Fig. 3a for Co3O4@BP. In order to strengthen the adhesion of larger metal building blocks on BP nanosheets, the electrostatic treatments would be included, and the solvent might need to be altered to an aqueous solution with a certain pH value. For example, Yin et al. have assembled BP and Ti3C2.53 By modification of the cationic polymer poly (diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDDA) on BP, the surface of BP nanosheets transformed to being electronegative and attracted Ti3C2, forming the PDDA-BP/Ti3C2 composites (see Fig. 3b).

4.2 Wet chemical methods
A similar synthesis method compared to the wet assembly is the wet chemical reduction method, in which the reductants (e.g., NaBH4) are required. The raw materials are BP nanosheets and metal salts. The advantage of wet chemical reduction is that the metallic materials could be in situ generated on the surface of BP, decreasing the influence of the contact barrier and forming a more intimate interface. In the example of Au/BP made by Jung et al., BP itself could act as the reductant.116 The BP nanosheets were suspended in acetonitrile and then mixed with tetrachloroauric acid (HAuCl4) at 50 °C for 1 h. After that, the gold nanoparticles autogenously grew on the surface of BP nanosheets, as shown in Fig. 3c. Similarly, Pt precursor could also be reduced by BP, owing to the difference in the reduction potential between those noble metal precursors and the BP work function.
4.3 Hydrothermal/solvothermal methods
The two wet solution methods are generally performed under a low temperature or even room temperature since the BP nanosheets could be highly active with heat. A commonly applied nanostructure synthesis method is the hydrothermal reaction carried under relatively high temperature and pressure. However, in order to preserve BP nanosheets, instead of the hydrothermal reaction, the solvothermal reaction is preferred in the synthesis of BP–Ms. The solvent used in the reaction requires to be totally dehydrated and deoxygenated. The advantage of this method is that the obtained BP–Ms would have a more uniform component distribution. Also, the metal salts could react with BP to form phosphides during the solvothermal reaction, which are very useful in catalysis or energy storage applications. As shown in Fig. 3d, the Ni2P@BP hybrid nanostructures were prepared by Yan et al. via a solvothermal reaction of NiCl2 precursors and BP nanosheets at 160 °C for 3 h with anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent.78 Another available synthesis method is the ball-milling process. Usually, the raw materials in this method would be bulk BP rather than exfoliated BP nanosheets or even red phosphorus in some cases. However, the obtained composites hardly present thin and large nanosheet morphology. Fig. 3e presents the TEM picture of the anatase titanium dioxide (ATN)-BP hybrids made from ball-milling by Fan et al., showing an aggregated morphology.54 The raw materials of the ATN-BP in ball-milling were TiO2 nanosheets obtained from solvothermal reaction and BP obtained from mechanical milling of red phosphorus.
4.4 Deposition methods
In addition, the methods discussed above are all suitable for dispersive BP nanosheets, and the different deposition methods are more favourable for the mechanically exfoliated BP applied in electronic devices. To date, there are sputtering, spin-coating, thermal evaporation, and chemical vapor deposition methods. These deposition methods usually require specific experimental conditions or instruments and are able to program the region and thickness of the metal layer. A typical example is shown in Fig. 3f, presenting a BP flake covered with a 30 nm-thick Cu layer and a 30 nm-thick Au layer.117 The Cu and Au were deposited onto the BP flakes by a thermal evaporator.
5. Applications of BP–Ms
The application range of BP–Ms nearly overlaps with that of BP, in which the BP–Ms are always great substitutes for BP. In this review, we mainly discussed four kinds of applications with many examples. There are also several unconventional yet interesting uses of BP–Ms, such as smoke suppression and toxicity reduction, lubrication, etc.60,95
5.1 Catalysis
The 2D materials usually are good candidates as heterogenous catalysts because the catalysis reactions are all surface related processes.13 The large surface-to-volume ratio of 2D nanostructured materials can provide more active centres and adsorb more reactant molecules. However, the application of pure BP as catalysts is greatly limited due to its inherent drawbacks of instability under ambient conditions (oxygen, water, and light) and high temperature condition. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of pure BP is usually far from satisfactory. Therefore, most of the recent research works have used BP–Ms to replace BP in various heterogenous catalysis applications. Here, two main catalyst genres of the BP–Ms would be introduced, namely, photocatalysts and electrocatalysts.

5.1.1 Photocatalysis. 
Solar-driven photocatalysis is widely used in various areas, such as the degradation of toxic organic chemicals in water or air, solar cell, and water splitting. The photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst mainly depends on the optical adsorption range, charge separation efficiency, and charge migration ability. To increase the efficiency of photocatalysts, it is necessary to reasonably modify the compositions or structures of the catalyst materials.118,119 Most traditional photocatalysts can only be activated under ultraviolet (UV) or visible light due to a wide band gap. Significant efforts have been devoted to extend the light adsorption of photocatalysts to near-infrared (NIR) range. Despite the endeavours, rational design and fabrication of photocatalysts with light adsorption in the full range of solar spectra still constitute a long-standing challenge.
According to previous reports, the BP nanosheets showed much better photocatalytic performance in H2 evolution than the bulk BP (nearly 18 times higher), reaching 512 μmol h−1 g−1 under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of BP was even higher than that reported for 2D graphitic carbon nitride catalysts.120 In addition, the BP nanosheets with a tunable band gap could theoretically be an intriguing material for increasing the lower energy photon (NIR) adsorption.121 However, the NIR responsibility of pristine BP is still limited. In order to enhance the light absorption ability from UV to NIR light, the introduction of plasmonic metal structures would be a good choice. Based on this strategy, the Majima group synthesized a BP–Au/La2Ti2O7 (BP–Au/LTO) hybrid material for H2 production under visible and NIR light irradiation.102 The possible mechanism for BP–Au/LTO to catalyse H2 production under visible and NIR light is shown in Fig. 4a. Firstly, in the visible light region (Fig. 4a, left), the gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) generally exhibit strong surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption, leading to the SPR excitation of electrons in Au NPs. Moreover, owing to the low work function of Au, the electrons generated from photo-excited BP could transfer to the surface of Au NP. These electrons would then overcome the interfacial Schottky barrier between Au and LTO to transfer to the conduction band (CB) of LTO, facilitating the H+ reduction process. While under NIR light irradiation (Fig. 4a, right), the electronic state in the interfacial surface of BP and Au could be excited to prepare electron–hole pairs. Eventually, the ternary BP–Au/LTO showed significant enhancement of H2 production compared to BP, LTO, and Au/LTO, with optimum H2 generation rates of about 0.74 and 0.30 mmol h−1 g−1 at wavelengths longer than 420 nm and 780 nm, respectively (see Fig. 4b).

While the Au NPs presented non-covalent interactions with BP to increase the photocatalytic performance, the covalent interactions of metal and BP could also boost H2 production. For instance, Yuan et al. designed a Co2P/BP photocatalyst by chemical reduction method, in which the Co2P was bonded to the BP nanosheets by Co–P bonds.72 The photocatalytic H2 production rate of the composite was about 39.7 times higher than that of bare BP nanosheets (Fig. 4c) and higher than several previous BP-based composites. The time-resolved fluorescence spectra of Co2P/BP and bare BP demonstrated that the fluorescence lifetime of Co2P/BP (1.89 ns) was much shorter than that of bare BP (14.73 ns). Therefore, the Co–P bonds in Co2P/BP were supposed to act as an interfacial atomic-level charge-flow highway to accelerate the electron transfer from BP to Co2P. According to the ab initio density functional (DFT) calculations, the Co–P bonds at the interfaces could significantly reduce the potential energy barrier. Fig. 4d demonstrated the electronic structure changes associated with the Co2P/BP heterojunction without (upper panel) and with (middle panel) chemical bonding from isolated layers. The electrostatic potential (ΔV) of Co2P/BP heterojunction with Co–P bonds was 14.01 eV, less than that of no Co–P bonds (22.10 eV). It is worth noting that this BP/metal covalent interaction is a generally auspicious outcome in photocatalyst design, which could accelerate the photogenerated electron migration in different types of photocatalysis reactions. Yu group synthesized Pt/BP as the photocatalyst for styrene hydrogenation also by in situ chemical reduction, with a Pt–P bond in the structure.98 The electron migration time of Pt/BP under light irradiation was 0.11 ps, according to a femtosecond pump-probe microscopic optical system. The in situ XPS (Fig. 4e) and DFT calculation results (Fig. 4f) also confirmed the efficient accumulation of photogenerated electrons on the Pt nanoparticles. Therefore, the Pt/BP photocatalyst presented a threefold increase in TOF compared to other Pt materials in styrene hydrogenation (Fig. 4g).


5.1.2 Electrocatalysis. 
The electrochemical water splitting reaction is a promising approach to generate hydrogen. There are two half reactions in water electrolysis, namely, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Both half reactions are sluggish and require efficient electrocatalysts on the electrodes to decrease the overpotentials. Pure BP has been applied as the electrocatalyst for OER since 2016.122 The catalytic performance of BP was comparable to other non-metal catalysts, yet still far poorer than those metal catalysts. In order to increase the electrocatalytic activity, several later works decorated metal or metal oxide nanostructures on the surface of BP. There were Co(OH)2/BP, Co3O4/BP, and Co/BP for OER,63,65,66 Pt/BP and PtRu/BP for HER.88,100 These BP–M electrocatalysts shared a similar synergistic effect that the electronic structure of BP/metal interfaces was modulated to a more favourable state due to the electron migration behaviour between BP and metal ions. A typical example is the Pt/BP electrocatalyst synthesized by Yu et al.100 The optimum Pt/BP exhibited a current density of 82.89 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH at an overpotential of 70 mV, see Fig. 5a (BPed-Pt/GR stands for BP activated Pt that was supported by graphite). As the XPS high-resolution spectra shown in Fig. 5b, with the existence of BP, the d-band center of the Pt downshifted towards the Fermi level, consequently leading to optimal adsorption of intermediates. According to the Sabatier principle, the neither too strong nor too weak absorption ability to the intermediates could greatly enhance the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst. The Gibbs free energy ΔGH* is a major descriptor for HER activity, and the optimum ΔGH* should be zero. The DFT calculation result revealed that at a certain Pt/BP ratio (18.75%∼25% in this work), the Gibbs free energy ΔGH* was much closer towards zero than pure Pt, as presented in Fig. 5c.

The above-mentioned BP–M electrocatalysts were all single functional, boosting only OER or HER. The bifunctional water splitting electrocatalysts could simplify the electrolytic system and cut costs in devices, attracting more and more attention. Yu group first prepared a BP/Co2P composite applied as bifunctional water splitting electrocatalysts.123 The Co2P nanocrystals were selectively grown on the BP edges as observed from the TEM picture in Fig. 5d, showing enhanced catalytic activity and increasing the stability of BP. The charge carrier concentration and electrical conductivity of BP nanosheets were improved by Co2P. The symmetrical electrolysis cell using BP/Co2P on both anode and cathode required 1.92 V to obtain 10 mA cm−2 current density, as shown in Fig. 5e. Our group recently also designed a CoFeO@BP bifunctional electrocatalyst, which fully utilized the interactions between amorphous metal oxides with BP.61 The amorphous CoFe oxides were in a metastable state. During the HER process, the strong affinity of BP towards metal ions facilitates the formation of CoFe phosphides, which became the real active sites for efficient HER. This process could be observed by in situ TEM characterizations, as presented in Fig. 5f. The phosphides enabled the HER catalytic activity of CoFeO@BP to be much higher than that of the CoFeO@graphene sample. While during the OER, the amorphous CoFe oxides catalyse the oxidization of water through a vacant-induced lattice oxygen participation mechanism (LOM), resulting in a fast OER process. The supporting effect of BP nanosheets prevent the amorphous oxides from collapsing due to the active LOM process. By applying CoFeO@BP as both the anode and cathode catalyst, a water electrolysis cell was fabricated, which required a cell voltage of only 1.58 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH (Fig. 5g).
Apart from the water electrolysis catalysts, BP–Ms have also been used in other electrocatalysis as efficient catalysts.92,97,107 For instance, Fan et al. fabricated an ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) catalyst comprised of Pd nanoparticles, anatase titanium dioxide (ATN), and BP nanosheets.54 This novel catalyst showed enhanced catalytic activity with a mass peak current density of 5023.8 mA mgPd−1, which was 6.87 times greater than that of the commercial Pd/C (Fig. 5h). The mass activity of Pd/ATN-BP was also superior to other 2D catalysts like Pd–Pt–Ag nanosheets, Pd@CoP nanosheets, and B,N-doped graphene nanoribbons. The ATN-BP supports were prepared by ball-milling. Within ATN-BP, BP is interconnected with ATN by cataclastic P–O–Ti bonds, facilitating the penetration of electrolytes into the interlayer space. Fig. 5i illustrates the CO-stripping voltammograms of Pd/ATN-BP catalysts with different feed mass percentages of Pd, indicating that the ATN/BP promoted the stripping of Coad on the Pd surfaces. A reasonable explanation for this promotion was that the ATN-BP had an excellent adsorption capacity of water molecules, resulting in the increase of OH-species on the surface. Since the removal of COad required the reactant pair OHad, the increased concentration of OH-species could promote the oxidation of CO to CO2.

5.2 Electronic devices
The electronic devices include field effect transistors (FETs), thermoelectric devices, and optoelectronic devices. BP is a prospective candidate in next-generation electronics. The superior properties of BP nanosheets are suitable for preparing high-speed and power-efficient nano electronics.2,124 One of the major devices in electronics is the FET, which is a three-terminal device that applies an electric field to control the current flow. An efficient FET requires properties like a high on/off ratio, elevated carrier (hole) mobility, and great conductivity. BP nanosheets, fortunately, meet all the criteria for the channel material of FETs, and the schematic diagram of a typical back-gate BP is presented in Fig. 6a.2 However, in an ambient environment, BP FETs have a short lifetime due to the degradation of BP nanosheets. The quick oxidation of BP causes serious deterioration of the appliance performance. Therefore, the BP FETs require surface encapsulation (e.g. Al2O3) to protect BP, incurring additional costs.125 Yu et al. used metal ions to modify the surface of BP nanosheets, and consequently, the stability and transistor performance of the nanosheets were both enhanced tremendously.93 They have tested different kinds of metal ions, and eventually chose Ag+. According to the XPS results and DFT calculations, the free Ag+ absorbed spontaneously on the BP surface by cation–π interaction to stabilize the lone-pair electrons on the P atoms, see Fig. 6b. The Ag+ modified BP FET showed hole mobility of 1666 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was more than twice higher than that of bare BP. The on/off ratio was even 44 times higher than that of bare BP. The Ag+ was absorbed on the surface of BP, in another case of BP–Cu composite, the Cu adatoms were doped onto the few-layer BP nanosheets.80 The introduction of Cu could transfer BP from p-type conduction to n-type conduction without any mobility loss. An inverter applying BP and BP–Cu respectively for p- and n-channels was designed, exhibiting a gain of 46, with a single contacting metal (as shown in Fig. 6c). Fig. 6d was the optical image of the device, and the black boxes outlined the Cu doped area on the BP nanosheet. Notably, the applied BP and BP–Cu actually were the same piece of exfoliated BP crystal, with no need for the local electrostatic gating to define the p-type and n-type channels.

In addition to FET applications, the low thermal conductivity, high electrical conductivity, and elevated Seebeck coefficient endow BP nanosheets to be an ideal nanomaterial as thermoelectric generators.126 However, most research works about pristine BP in thermoelectric applications are still in the theoretical stage, mainly due to the poor stability of BP nanosheets in practical devices. According to Cho et al., the decoration of BP with Au NPs could help increase the electrical conductivity in conjunction and improve the ambient stability of the whole composite in thermoelectric generators.103Fig. 6e demonstrated the time-varying resistances of pristine BP and Au–BP under an ambient atmosphere. The resistance of pristine BP increased by over 240 times due to the fast degradation, while the Au–BP showed barely any change in resistance after the same treatment. Consequently, the power factor of optimum Au-decorated BP was enhanced 2740 times compared to pure BP, reaching 68.5 μV m−1 K−2 (see Fig. 6f). Finally, a vertical thermoelectric generator comprising Au-decorated BP as a p-type source was stably fabricated, demonstrating higher power output than that comprising pristine BP.
When it comes to optoelectronics, the light absorption ability is one of the key factors that have a huge effect on the device performance. Namely, the upper limit of the performance is determined by the light absorption capability of the materials. The absorbance of BP decreases as the wavelength increases, leading to a modest NIR responsivity.127 Therefore, exploring an efficient strategy to improve the light absorption (especially NIR region) of BP is of significant importance for better utilization of 2D BP in optoelectronic devices. Wang et al. found an abnormal NIR absorption in Ag–BP composites comprised of BP nanosheets and Ag nanoclusters (AgNCs).28 As shown in Fig. 6g, the optical appearance of Ag–BP was obviously different from the pristine BP. The spectrum of Ag–BP could be fitted in two peaks, i.e., peak I and peak II, see Fig. 6h. Peak I is located at ≈477 nm, originating from the LSPR of AgNCs, which also existed in the pure Ag sample. Peak II is located at ≈746 nm and is supposed to originate from the Ag/P interfacial coupling. In order to delve into a deep understanding of this phenomenon and the interactions between AgNC and BP, DFT and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculation methods were employed. As demonstrated in Fig. 6i, the incorporation of Ag on the BP surface introduced two nearly flat states in the bandgap of the pristine BP. These two gap states were revealed in the finite cluster calculations as HOMO and HOMO-1. In the subsequent simulated absorption spectra shown in Fig. 6j, the broad absorption in the range of 1100–700 nm was brought by the transitions from HOMO and HOMO-1 to the low-lying LUMOs. The examples for the two sharp peaks are presented in the inset of Fig. 6j. Eventually, a FET made from the Ag–BP composite showed an enhanced NIR responsivity (35 times at 808 nm), thus achieving a high-performance NIR photodetector.
5.3 Biomedical applications
Till now, plenty of research works about BP as a fundamental material in biomedical devices have already emerged.7,128 The instability of BP became no longer a detrimental shortcoming in biomedical applications because the elemental P is a vital bone constituent and benign to the human body. Among various biomedical applications, the BP–Ms are mainly utilized in cancer therapeutics and bioimaging.129–131 Due to biocompatibility concerns, only a few kinds of metals or metal compounds are suitable for designing BP–M for biomedical applications.
Photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) are both highly efficient anticancer approaches in cancer therapeutics.130 Although PTT and PDT are completely different in therapy mechanisms, they both are driven by light irradiation. A higher therapy effect by combination of these two phototherapy methods under single light irradiation can be expected. The advantage of BP in PTT and PDT applications is the same as that in photocatalysis, viz., the NIR light responsibility. The NIR light has a good penetration ability towards biological tissues; thus, the NIR irradiation is capable of overcoming a certain thickness of tissue barrier.132 Therefore, BP nanosheets are supposed to be an efficient photosensitizer. In order to endow the BP-based bioagent with multiple functions, Lin et al. developed a novel nanocomposite assembly of iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) and Au NPs on BP (BPs@Au@Fe3O4), as shown in Fig. 7a.58 The composite showed a broad light absorption band and a photodegradable character. It could effectively inhibit tumours by PTT and PDT under NIR laser irradiation, see Fig. 7b. The Au NPs promoted the PTT and PDT process due to the plasmonic photothermal effect. The magnetic Fe3O4 is also a useful building block for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the magnetism property of the composite is demonstrated in Fig. 7c. The photodynamic effect of BP nanosheets, the photothermal effect of Au NPs, as well as the tumour targeting and MRI-guiding ability of Fe3O4, contributed to a multifunctional nanoplatform with remarkable therapeutic effects and improved selectivity compared to traditional remedies. Other similar works were MnO2–BP,55 lanthanide (Ln) sulfonate–BP,22 and genipin [GP]–polyglutamic acid [PGA]–Fe3O4@BP nanodots.133

Compared to other 2D materials, the biocompatibility and biodegradability make BP perfect support for metal nanoparticles for medical usage. Wang group decorated Ag NPs onto BP nanosheets to prepare a nanocomposite for bacteria sterilization.94 The Ag NPs inherently had a great affinity toward bacteria and could be active antibacterial agents. However, the employment of pure Ag NPs is also perilous to the human body for the toxicity of excessive Ag+, which is intractable to control. As the substrate, BP nanosheets could guarantee a sustained and moderate release of Ag species, minimizing the cytotoxicity of the composites. The BP–AgNP was also a good photocatalyst to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for solar disinfection, and the correlating scheme is illustrated in Fig. 7d. The density of states (DOSs) of pure BP and BP–AgNP were calculated, as shown in Fig. 7e. The incorporation of Ag NPs generated more occupying states, which were close to the Fermi level, demonstrating that Ag NPs not only modulated the band gap of the composites to accelerate the electron–hole pair separation, but also provided a preferred site for facilitating the adsorption and activation of O2. The perfect antibacterial performance of BP–AgNP without and with light is shown in Fig. 7f and g, respectively, quantifying the amount of Escherichia coli around the wound tissues after treatment with BP–AgNP. Compared with the previously reported 2D g-C3N4 loaded Ag NPs (AgNPs/g-C3N4), the Ag amount of BP–AgNP was much lower to achieve the same antibacterial effect.
5.4 Sensors
The potential of BP as a gas sensor has been explained in previous articles, namely, paramagnetic molecules like NO or NO2 could strongly bind with BP, and the current along with BP increases with the adsorption of these gases.134–137 Most of the BP-based gas sensors are made up of FETs, which again require increasing the stability of BP nanosheets. Our group recently coated metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) onto the surface of BP, obtaining a super stable composite BP@MIL-53 for NO2 sensing, as illustrated in Fig. 8a.105 The BP nanosheets were first decorated with Al3+, and then a dense and uniform coating of MOF-53 was realized by the further solvothermal reaction. The MOF coating could protect BP both in ambient and harsh situations due to the integrated Al3+ functionalization on BP. When the working temperature was 70 °C, the BP@MIL-53 sensor was able to present great response repeatability and recyclability to NO2. Furthermore, the response time of BP@MIL-53 (66 s) was faster than the reported reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (3600 s), and single-layer MoS2 (660 s), demonstrating the great sensing activity of BP@MIL-53.

(b) Gas response of Pt/BP and pristine BP toward various H2 concentrations. (c) Tunable gas response behaviour of Au/BP achieved by controlling Au incorporation concentrations.

The selectivity of BP towards NO and NO2 could be changed by metal incorporation, extending the detection range of vapor molecules. For example, the Jung group synthesized Au/BP and Pt/BP by autogenous reduction.116 The Pt/BP was able to detect low concentrations of H2 gas (approximately 1% concentration), and the sensitivity was comparable to the commercial metal oxide semiconductors (Fig. 8b). The mechanism of this selective H2 gas sensing was based on the good affinity of Pt with H2. When H2 gas was injected, the H2 molecules absorbed onto the Pt surface and dissociated into H atoms, which significantly decreased the work function of Pt. Subsequently, the electrons transferred from Pt to BP, resulting in increased channel resistance. On the other hand, the Au/BP still showed selectivity towards NO2, but the response toward NO2 varied from negative to positive compared with pristine BP (Fig. 8c).
6. Conclusion and outlook
The pristine BP possesses many favourable characteristics compared to graphene, TMDCs, or other existing 2D materials, while the instability problem greatly restrains BP from truly becoming a dominant 2D nanomaterial. Therefore, incorporating metal-based materials with BP to build BP–Ms is a highly promising strategy to exploit the potential of BP and overcome its limitations. The advancements of nanoscience and nanotechnology on previous 2D material composites have paved the way for correlating research about BP–Ms.138 With the assistance of theoretical simulations, modern characterization methods, and systematic mechanism analysis, the development of BP–Ms has grown fast in a few years.
A good hybrid material is ought to show characteristics that are a whole greater than the sum of the parts. For BP–Ms, the structural differences from the separated materials (BP and the metals) raise property differences. A major advantage is the enhanced stability compared to pure BP, which is mainly caused by the interactions of metal ions with lone-pair electrons on BP and the physical covering influence. In addition to the stability, the BP–Ms also present higher chemical activity for redox reactions, more suitable electron transferring ability in various devices, and other strengthened capabilities resulting from the metal-induced electronic structure modification. As illustrated in Fig. 9, the relationship between BP and metal-based materials in BP–Ms is like the dancing partner: they both possess several talents, and the interactions between them are the key points for the performances.
 Fig. 9  The significant role of the interactions between black phosphorous and metals. 
The great advantages significantly expand the scope of BP–Ms applications, including catalysis, electronic devices, biomedicine, and sensors. However, opportunities and challenges coexist. The major challenge is the synthesis of BP–Ms. The limitations in synthesis methods originate from the vulnerable nature of BP. To preserve the 2D morphology and the basic properties of BP, the synthesis of BP–Ms has to be performed under gentle and oxygen/water isolated conditions. As a result, the types of metals (or metal compounds) are restrained, and the quality or morphology of these functionalized parts is hard to control and optimize. For example, it is very tough to decorate and immobilize separated metal atoms on the surface of BP nanosheets to produce single-atom catalysts with great catalytic activity.64,139 In addition, despite plenty of metals or metallic materials being great conductors, the present BP–Ms usually have a limited improvement in electric conductivity compared to the BP–carbon composites because the existing synthesis methods could only maintain a relatively low metal loading ratio and crystalline degree.140 The poor electric conductivity greatly restrained this kind of composites in energy storage applications because the electrode materials applied in energy storage devices (i.e., chargeable batteries) must have minimum resistance to cut the energy loss.9–11 Therefore, it is still of significant importance to create novel synthesis strategies for BP–Ms with more favourable morphology and quality.
Apart from the synthesis methods, the characterization is another focus point about the BP–Ms in future studies. To date, most of BP–Ms are heterojunctions rather than matrix or continuous phases containing unique interfaces. Thus, the pivotal interfaces become the true active sites. Many simulation studies have analysed and predicted the interactions between different metals and BP, such as the changes in structural, mechanical, electrical, and magnetic properties. However, in most practical applications, the interactions and interfaces in BP–Ms have been neglected. The qualitative and quantitative explorations of the interactions between BP and metals contribute to the mechanism analysis, in turn providing guidance for more efficient materials. To realize the exploration, apart from the traditional XPS, Raman characterizations, XAS, Cs-corrected TEM, and several in situ characterization methods could be applied. Also, it is necessary to take reasonable controlling experiments to verify the exact functions of the interactions. Eventually, by strengthening the favourable interactions on the interfaces and increasing the proportion of the interfaces, the properties of BP–Ms could be intensively improved.
In conclusion, the unique atomic and electronic structure of BP rendered the popularity of BP correlated studies and applications. The cooperation of metal-based materials with BP could make up for the shortage of BP and greatly extend the potential of BP in various applications. The interactions between metals and BP are fundamental factors for this kind of composite, which have been studied by both computational simulations and modern characterization methods. Compared to other types of BP-based composites (e.g., BP–carbon, BP–polymer), the acid–base Lewis type interactions in BP–M could contribute to more profound property changes due to the electron transition behaviour. On the other hand, these interactions with metals barely exist in other 2D materials, making BP–M an intriguing heterogenous nanostructure. Therefore, designing and developing BP–Ms offer a scalable route for tailoring the properties of the constituent materials, especially the BP nanosheets. Although the correlated research studies and utilizations of BP–Ms are still confined to academic institutes and laboratories for the challenges in synthesis and yield, we believe that they will contribute to practical applications in the near future with the thriving achievements of BP and its composites.
