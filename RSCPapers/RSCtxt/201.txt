    , Accepted 8th April 2015First published on 8th April 2015AbstractSeveral nanostructuring methods have been demonstrated to produce a variety of nanostructured materials, and these methods are well recognized as effective paradigms for improving the performance of thermoelectric materials. Among the variety of nanostructured materials, bulk nanostructured materials have been shown to be the most promising because they not only have high ZT, but they can also be fabricated in large quantities, unlike many other nanostructured materials, making them desirable for large scale industrial application. In this study, the nanostructuring paradigm is extended for the first time to the bulk Mg3Sb2 and Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 Zintl phase compounds, which despite the advantages of price and abundance, so far have been disregarded for thermoelectric research due to low ZT relative to the available state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials. The nanostructuring of bulk Mg3Sb2 and Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2, employing high energy ball milling followed by spark plasma sintering yields a ZT of ∼0.4 and ∼0.94 at 773 K, which are 54% and 56% higher values, respectively, than their respective bulk counterparts. The enhancement in the ZT of these materials is primarily due to the significant reduction in thermal conductivity caused by phonon scattering at numerous grain boundaries of nanostructured materials. The observed decrease in the thermal conductivity of these bulk nanostructured materials is quantified using a simple model that combines the macroscopic effective medium approach (EMA) with the concepts of Kapitza resistance. The microstructural investigation of these nanostructured materials was carried out employing high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).
1. Introduction
Globally, the consumption of energy is outpacing the production, and the direct and indirect environmental impact has resulted in an urgent need for the development of effective energy conversion technologies. Out of the several energy conversion technologies, the thermoelectric energy conversion of heat into electricity and vice versa, using the so called thermoelectric materials, is receiving tremendous interest and attention.1–3 Despite their high reliability, simplicity and of course unique technical merits, thermoelectric materials have found only a few niche applications mainly due to their low conversion efficiency.4 A much wider application of these materials requires the designing of high performance thermoelectric materials. Thermoelectric material design primarily focusses on optimizing its figure of merit, defined as ZT = S2σT/κ, where S represents the Seebeck coefficient, σ is the electrical conductivity, κ (=κe + κl) is the thermal conductivity, which includes contributions from the charge carriers (κe) and from the lattice (κl), and T is the absolute temperature.5 Therefore, to attain the maximum thermoelectric performance, the power factor (=S2σ) needs to be increased with simultaneous decrease in thermal conductivity (κ). However, the carrier density considerations inhibit any increase in S, often leading to a decrease in σ. Furthermore, σ and κ are also coupled through the Wiedemann–Franz law, and thus an increase in σ simultaneously leads to increase in κ as well.5
The current strategies to improve the ZT are focused on circumventing the interdependencies of these three competing parameters by the simultaneous optimization of the power factor and reduction in the thermal conductivity through several strategies such as doping,6–9 solid solution alloying,10–14 several ideally engineered materials,15–17 materials developed based on the phonon glass and electron crystal (PGEC) concept,18–20 and nanostructuring/nanocomposites.21–25 Among all these strategies, the nanostructuring approach has made a marked contribution in achieving a high ZT of thermoelectric materials. This approach suggests that the ZT enhancement can be realized due to the nanoscale size of grains or nanostructured morphologies of the materials.26–28 The small grain sizes of these nanostructured materials lead to a drastic increase in the density of grain boundaries, and the high concentration of grain boundaries is expected to lower the lattice thermal conductivity of the materials. Nanostructuring introduces numerous interfaces, in which the phonons can be more effectively and preferentially scattered over a large mean free path range compared to the electrons; thus, it can effectively reduce the lattice thermal conductivity while preserving carrier mobility and electronic conduction. Moreover, the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level can also be enhanced in nanostructured materials via quantum confinement, leading to an increase in the Seebeck coefficient. Despite the high density of grains in nanostructured materials, the scattering of electrons in the nanostructured samples does not take place effectively because of the much shorter mean free path of the electrons, and thus the electrical conductivity together with a high Seebeck coefficient is maintained, which is in contrast to the usual observation. Nanostructuring can therefore provide an efficient way to decouple all three competing parameters: Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, up to a certain extent.26–28 Biswas et al.29 established an endotaxial nanostructuring approach derived by a precipitation and growth mechanism for even better optimization of electronic properties along with the significant reduction in thermal conductivity, resulting in high ZT.
Based on these unique features of nanostructured materials, a variety of nanostructures in different dimensions, such as superlattices,30 quantum dots,31 and nanowires,32,33 have also been designed with an appreciable improvement in their thermoelectric response. However, the high ZT in such artificially tailored nanostructured materials is not of much practical use in large-scale commercial applications because their nano-fabrication processes are rather tedious and expensive. However, a nanostructured material fabricated using a bulk process, rather than nanofabrication techniques, has the advantage of being able to be produced in large quantities and in a form that is compatible with commercially available devices.24–28,34–36
In the present study, the premise of the nanostructuring approach has been extended for the first time to a potential p-type bulk Zintl phase compound of Mg3Sb2 (ref. 11–13, 37–41) and also to its derivative Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2, which has been studied previously by our group.11 Mg3Sb2-based materials are an important class of thermoelectric materials belonging to the Zintl phase family. These materials exhibit phonon glass and electron crystal (PGEC) behaviour, rendering low thermal conductivity similar to that of glass and electrical conductivity like metal, which is a requisite feature of a material for potential thermoelectricity. Thus, looking at the potentiality of Mg3Sb2-based thermoelectric materials and using the premises of nanostructuring approach, high energy ball milling (HEBM) of bulk single phase Mg3Sb2 and Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 materials for different periods of milling e.g. 10, 20 and 30 h, has been performed to examine the nanostructuring effect on thermoelectric properties. The consolidation of these mechanically alloyed nanopowders was carried out employing a spark plasma assisted (SPS) reaction sintering to synthesize the bulk nanostructured materials in the form of dense pellets. The consolidation and sintering by SPS is a well known technique used to retard the grain growth. In the SPS process, high energy current pulses are passed through a graphite die, which contains the ball milled nano-powder under pressure, which momentarily generates a plasma between the grains, resulting in highly localized temperatures.42,43 The rapid heating rates combined with pressure produce samples with approximate theoretical density. Unlike the hot-pressing technique, the extremely short sintering time cycle in SPS prohibits mass transport, followed by grain growth, and thus retains the nanostructure features that were achieved during the ball-milling.42,43 Furthermore, the homogeneity of the sintered sample is an added advantage of SPS. Interestingly, bulk nanostructured materials were obtained after SPS, which have been examined by HRTEM investigation. An enhanced ZT of ∼0.4 at 773 K was observed for bulk nanostructured Mg3Sb2, which is ∼54% larger than its bulk counterpart (i.e. ZT = ∼0.26 at 773 K). Similarly, an enhanced ZT of ∼0.94 at 773 K was observed in the bulk nanostructured Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 sample, which is comparable to the other state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials. This enhancement in ZT is ∼56% higher than its bulk counterpart (i.e. ZT = ∼0.6 at 773 K). The reduction in the thermal conductivity of these materials resulted from the effective phonon scattering at numerous grain boundaries and is a primary cause for high ZT. The effect of grain boundary scattering on the thermal conductivity is investigated in the framework of a simple model describing the macroscopic effective medium approach with the concept of the Kapitza resistance proposed by Nan et al.44–47
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis
Stoichiometric amounts of high purity magnesium (Mg; 99.99%, Alfa Aesar), antimony (Sb; 99.99%, Alfa Aesar), and bismuth (Bi; 99.99%, Alfa Aesar) for synthesizing Mg3Sb2−xBix (with x = 0, 0.2) were blended by mechanical milling, and subsequently ground in an agate mortar. The blended powders were then subjected to spark plasma sintering (SPS) at a temperature of 1073 K and a pressure of 50 MPa for a holding time of 10 minutes, yielding pellets of 12.7 mm diameter and 2.5 mm thickness. The SPS was performed under high vacuum conditions, which eliminate adsorptive gas and impurities that exist on the surface of the powder particles, thus preventing oxidation and resulting in very clean samples. The SPS of powdered materials involves simultaneous melting and consolidation, which together result in single phase materials. These single phase materials were crushed into powders and subsequently subjected to a high energy mechanical ball milling (HEBM, Fritsch, Pulverisette-4) for periods of 10, 20 and 30 hours to achieve nanostructured materials of polycrystalline Zintl phase. The ball-to-powder weight ratio was optimized at 25:1 and the whole process of milling was carried out in argon atmosphere with a speed of 400 rpm. To prevent re-welding and promote the fracturing of powder particles, 2 wt% of stearic acid was added as a process control agent. The processing of the ball milled alloy powders was carried out in a glove box (Mbraun, MB20) to avoid oxidation and other atmospheric contamination. The mechanically milled nanopowders were then consolidated again using SPS at 873 K and a pressure of 50 MPa for a holding time of 3 minutes to maintain their nanostructured features. The SPS resulted in nanostructured Zintl phase compounds having 12.7 mm diameter and 2.0 mm thickness. The volume densities of all the samples were measured using an Archimedes' kit. The density of the plasma sintered samples was observed to be 99% of the theoretical density.
2.2 Structural characterization
The gross structural characterization of bulk Mg3Sb2−xBix (x = 0 & 0.2) with their bulk nanostructured counterparts was carried out by a powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Mini Flex II) using a graphite monochromator and CuKα radiation with wavelength λ ≈ 1.5406 Å, along with CuKα2 filter and rotating anode equipped with a powder 2θ diffractometer ranging from 20 to 80 degrees. The microstructure and compositional analysis were investigated by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; model: SUPRA40 VP, operating at 30 kV) equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, Technai G2T30; W-Twin) operating at 300 kV. The TEM specimens were prepared in three steps and are described elsewhere.11–13
2.3 Thermal and electronic transport properties
The polished SPSed pellets of Mg3Sb2−xBix (with x = 0 & 0.2) samples were used directly for thermal diffusivity measurements parallel to the pressing direction using a laser flash system (Lineseis, LFA 1000) on disk-shaped thin specimens with an approximate thickness of 1.5 mm and a diameter of 12.7 mm. The disc specimens used for thermal diffusivity were sprayed with a layer of graphite to minimize errors due to emissivity. Specific heat was determined by a DSC instrument (822e Mettler Toledo). The thermal conductivity of all the samples was calculated using the relation, κ = d × Cp × ρ, where κ is the thermal conductivity, d is the thermal diffusivity, ρ is the geometrical pellet density and Cp is the specific heat capacity. The polished bars of about 3 × 1.5 × 10 mm3 were cut from the consolidated disks and used to measure the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient in a direction perpendicular to the pressing direction by employing a commercial equipment (ULVAC, ZEM3) over the temperature range of 300 K to 773 K.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 X-ray diffraction analysis
The phase purity of all the samples was verified prior to performing any transport property measurements. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern obtained on the SPSed samples of Mg3Sb2−xBix (with x = 0 & 0.2) are shown in Fig. 1. All the reflections can be indexed to β-Mg3Sb2 (JCPDS-00-003-0375) and no secondary phase was observed (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the XRD of both bulk nanostructured samples show the presence of peak broadening, which indicates that the materials are nanostructured. The average crystallite size calculated using the Williamson–Hall method48 is ∼12 nm and 10 nm for nanostructured Mg3Sb2 and Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2, respectively, after 30 h of ball-milling. The cell constants of both bulk and nanostructured samples were estimated by the POLSQ FORTRAN program,49 and are presented in ESI Table ST1.† The XRD pattern of the bulk Mg3Sb2−xBix (x = 0 & 0.2) and nanostructured samples obtained by different periods of ball milling are shown in the ESI Fig. S1.†

3.2 Scanning electron microscopy
For further confirming the phase and homogeneities at the microscopic level, field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was carried out for bulk Mg3Sb2−xBix (x = 0 & 0.2) and their nanostructured counterparts. The homogeneities of all the samples were assessed by averaging the compositions at 4 different regions of each sample by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EADX). The average value of composition is shown in Fig. 2, marked as EDAX compositions, indicating a homogeneous phase. The morphological evidence, as presented in Fig. 2(a–d), for bulk Mg3Sb2, bulk Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 and their bulk nanostructured counterparts, respectively, present almost similar contrasts of grains. The grain sizes of the nanostructured samples are observed to be smaller than their bulk counterparts. The FE-SEM EDAX mapping was recorded for all the samples, showing a distribution of the elemental phases in proper proportions to their stoichiometric compositions (Fig. 2). The SEM-EDAX spectrum of bulk Mg3Sb2−xBix (x = 0 & 0.2) with their nanostructured counterparts were also recorded from regions marked by rectangles, and their compositions were computed and are presented as EDAX weight histograms (Fig. 2c and d).

3.3 Transmission electron microscopy investigation

Fig. 3 presents the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the nanostructured Mg3Sb2 and Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 alloys. The microstructure features at lattice resolution were determined using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). In general, the HRTEM of these bulk nanostructured alloys reveals the nanoscale features and shows uniform microstructures with nanoscale crystallites, including some microstructural defects (Fig. 3b and e), which could be due to long hours of ball-milling.23,24,43 The bright field electron micrograph obtained from the specimen of the bulk nanostructured Mg3Sb2 exhibits a polycrystalline structure throughout the volume of the material (Fig. 3a). The micrograph shows grains with different sizes ranging from 4 nm to 40 nm. The number of crystallites and their size distribution is shown in the inset of Fig. 3a. Several lattice resolution images were recorded to understand the presence of different orientations of the crystallographic planes and their interface boundaries. Fig. 3b presents the HRTEM image obtained from a sample showing several grains orientated along the different planes of Mg3Sb2 and several joint interface boundaries. The micrograph (Fig. 3b) clearly reveals that the individual grains are truly crystalline with stacking of different planes and with random orientation with respect to each other. Several planes 110 (0.229 nm), 213 (0.127 nm) and 100 (0.398 nm) of Mg3Sb2 hexagonal crystal structure, are clearly seen. The elemental composition of the Mg3Sb2 sample estimated from energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis (EDAX) in conjunction with TEM (Fig. 3c) reveals that the composition is very close to the nominal composition of Mg3Sb2 alloy. A bright field electron micrograph (Fig. 3d) corresponding to the specimen of bulk nanostructured Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 shows a polycrystalline structure similar to Mg3Sb2 with relatively smaller grain sizes ranging from 3 nm to 30 nm. The crystallites size distribution is shown in the inset of Fig. 3d. The lattice scale images reveal the randomly distributed grains oriented in different planes 204 (0.134 nm), 102 (0.27 nm), 103 (0.206 nm) of Mg3Sb2 hexagonal crystal structure (Fig. 3e). Interestingly, the lattices associated with the grains of bulk nanostructured Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 are observed to be a little distorted together with some misfit-type of dislocations at the interfaces, as marked by arrows in Fig. 3e. The distortions in the lattices at the microscopic level may be due to local strain, resulting from the substitution of a heavy metal, namely, Bi, at Sb sites in the structure of Mg3Sb2. The estimation of elemental composition of the Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 sample from energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis (EDAX) in conjunction with TEM (Fig. 3f) reveals that the composition is very close to the nominal composition of Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 alloy.

3.4 Electronic transport properties

Fig. 4 shows the temperature dependence of the electronic transport properties of bulk Mg3Sb2−xBix (x = 0 & 0.2) and their nanostructured counterparts. The temperature dependent behavior σ(T) of all the samples, presented in Fig. 4a, reveals semiconducting behavior because it increases monotonically with increasing temperature. Interestingly, the σ(T) of the nanostructured materials is noted to be lower than that of their normal bulk counterparts, not only at room temperature but over the entire temperature range. Fig. 4b presents the temperature dependence behavior of the Seebeck coefficients of all the samples. The Seebeck coefficients of the nanostructured samples are also observed to be higher than those of their normal bulk counterparts over the entire temperature range, as shown in Fig. 4b. However, with the increase of temperature beyond 673 K, the Seeback coefficient decreases slightly for all the samples. This decrease in Seeback coefficient at high temperatures beyond 673 K is attributed to thermally excited minority charge carriers (electrons) similar to the case of several semiconducting materials.16,50,51 The temperature dependent behavior of the power factor of bulk Mg3Sb2−xBix (x = 0 & 0.2) and their nanostructured counterparts is plotted in Fig. 4c. The power factor of nanostructured samples is slightly decreased as compared to their bulk counterparts due to a decrease in the electrical conductivity over the entire temperature range. The decrease in the power factors of nanostructured Mg3Sb2 and Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 was noted to be a reduction of about 1.5% and 8.5%, respectively, in comparison to that of their bulk counterparts.

We also determined the Hall coefficients of all the samples at 300 K. These data yielded a carrier concentration of 1.1 × 1020 cm−3 and 2.9 × 1020 cm−3 for bulk Mg3Sb2 and Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2, respectively, while a carrier concentration of 7.8 × 1019 cm−3 and 9.2 × 1019 cm−3 for nanostructured Mg3Sb2 and Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2, respectively, was noted. Evidently, both the nanostructured materials exhibited lower carrier concentration as compared to their respective bulk counterparts.
The observed increase in the Seeback coefficient and decrease in the electrical conductivity of both the nanostructured samples at room temperature compared to those of their respective bulk counterparts are consistent with their lower carrier densities, as revealed by Hall measurements. The reduction in the carrier density of the nanostructured materials may be due to either the trapping of carriers at the interface barrier generated between the nano domain boundaries,23,24 or the defects which may be negatively charged and thus may trap the holes of the system, thereby decreasing the carrier densities of the system.52,53 Unfortunately, increasing values of the S(T) and σ(T) with rising temperature (Fig. 4a and b) for the nanostructured materials are rather unusual and need a detail high temperature Hall effect over the entire temperature range to understand the exact mechanism of electronic transport in these nanostructured materials.
3.5 Thermal transport properties
In addition to electronic transport, a thermal conductivity measurement is also equally important for quantifying the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT). Fig. 5 shows the temperature dependence of total thermal conductivity κ(T) of bulk Mg3Sb2−xBix (x = 0 & 0.2) and their nanostructured counterparts. The temperature dependency of κ decreases with temperature, displaying a T−1 type behavior, which commonly occurs in bulk crystalline solids. The κ(T) of bulk Mg3Sb2−xBix (x = 0 & 0.2) and their nanostructured counterparts (Fig. 5a) decreases gradually with rising temperature. The decrease of κ in nanostructured samples compared with their bulk counterparts is mainly due to the increased scattering of phonons by the high density of grain boundaries in the sintered bulk nanostructured samples. It is worth mentioning that the high density of grain boundaries due to small crystallites developed from employing high energy ball milling is maintained in the bulk nanostructured samples obtained by spark plasma assisted reaction sintering (SPS) technique for consolidation.24,43 To get a quantitative view of the effect of ball milling followed by SPS on phonon transport, the lattice thermal conductivity (κl) was estimated by subtracting the electronic contribution (κe) from the total thermal conductivity (κ). The electronic thermal conductivity (κe) can be estimated using the Wiedemann–Franz law (i.e. κe = LσT, where L is the Lorenz number, σ is the electrical conductivity and T is the temperature in K), and it is presented in Fig. 5b. Here, we use the temperature dependent Lorenz number54 and the bipolar contribution was taken into account by assuming κlattice = ∼T−1.55Fig. 5c represents the temperature dependent lattice thermal conductivity. Within expectation, the lattice thermal conductivity (Fig. 5c) of both the nanostructured materials was decreased. For instance, we obtained kl ≈ 1.38 W m−1 K−1 and ∼0.94 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature for the bulk Mg3Sb2 and nanostructured Mg3Sb2, respectively, while lattice thermal conductivities of ∼1.18 W m−1 K−1 and ∼0.90 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature were observed for bulk Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 and nanostructured Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 samples, respectively. The lattice thermal conductivities (κl) of nanostructured Mg3Sb2 and Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 samples at room temperature were observed to be about ∼31% and ∼24% lower than those of their respective bulk counterparts. The decrease in the lattice thermal conductivity is mainly attributed to a stronger boundary scattering in the nanostructured samples. There is no significant difference in total and lattice thermal conductivity (Fig. 5a and c). It appears that the lattice thermal conductivity is a large portion of the total thermal conductivity because the electronic thermal conductivity is negligible due to a very low value of electrical conductivity.

The most widely used model to understand the effect of grain size on the κ in polycrystalline materials involves the relaxation time approach of the phonon boundary scattering mechanism described in the Callaway model.56 However, the decrease in thermal conductivity due to grain size effects in polycrystalline materials can also be understood by a simple model proposed by Nan and Birringer et al.44,45 This simple model stands on the concept of Kapitza resistance, which expresses the thermal boundary resistance present either at the interfaces of two materials or grains of the same material with the macroscopic effective medium approach (EMA).57,58 The model describes the observed grain-size dependent κ of polycrystalline materials and, most importantly, offers a simple and practical method to determine the Kapitza resistance, thus describing the grain-size effect on a quantitative basis. Although the shape and orientation of the crystallites may be fitted into the model, we considered the simplest case of a polycrystalline material, assuming spherical grains with diameter d. Using this approximation, the thermal conductivity κ is given by (1)where κ0 is the bulk thermal conductivity of the grains and Rk is the Kapitza resistance of the grain boundaries. Eqn (1) is used to determine both κ0 and Rk by fitting the experimental data of κ−1 against d−1 at each temperature, assuming a linear approximation for all the nanostructured samples. Fig. 6a and b present the experimental data and fitted lines in the range of 373–773 K for Mg3Sb2 and Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2, respectively. The fitted values of κ0 and Rk are taken from Table 1 and plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 7. From these values, κ0 and Rk at 323 K (RT) were also extrapolated and are shown in Table 1, where the value of Rk at 323 K is taken to be the same as that at 373 and 423 K because the decrease in Rk with decreasing temperature has already reached its limit in this range, as shown in Fig. 7. This is in agreement with previous studies of other semiconductor systems,45,59–61 where Rk was found to be almost independent of temperature over a wide range around room temperature. For example, both n- and p-Si0.8Ge0.2 alloys were reported to have approximately the same value of Rk = 5.0 × 10−8 m2 kW−1 in studies where the effect of the grain size on the transport properties is discussed.62 Nan and Birriger44,45 have also introduced the concept of Kapitza length, Lk = Rkκ0, as an important characteristic length to quantify the grain-size dependence of κ for a given material. The values of Lk for the Mg3Sb2−xBix (x = 0 & 0.2) alloys have therefore been calculated and are given in Table 1. According to eqn (1), k decreases to k0/2 when d = 2Lk, and d = 0.5; Lk is required to further reduce κ at 20% of κ0. At room temperature, Lk equals to 55 and 43 nm for Mg3Sb2 and Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 samples, respectively, which is smaller compared to the typical values of Lk in the range of 250–800 nm for Si–Ge alloys.45,62 One may easily anticipate that κ of these samples is very low, which may cause a significant increase in the thermoelectric figure-of-merit (ZT).

3.6 Thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT)
The temperature dependence of ZT for bulk Mg3Sb2−xBix (x = 0 & 0.2) and their nanostructured counterparts were calculated and are displayed in Fig. 8. The ZT of all the samples were observed to increase with increasing temperature. The maximum ZT ≈ 0.94 at 773 K for bulk nanostructured Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 was optimized, which is significantly enhanced by >55% when compared with its bulk counterpart (ZT = ∼0.6 for Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2) and >250% enhancement in ZT was estimated when compared with parent bulk Mg3Sb2 alloy (ZT ≈ 0.26 for Mg3Sb2). The enhancement in ZT is primarily due to drastic reduction in thermal conductivity with simultaneous increase in the Seebeck coefficient.

3.7 Thermoelectric compatibility factor
The thermoelectric compatibility factor (S) is also an important parameter that plays a vital role in the formation of thermoelectric devices. This new physical parameter was suggested by Synder et al.63 in 2003. The value of the thermoelectric compatibility factor of any material is described in its applicability as a segmented couple with other materials for the fabrication of a thermoelectric device in power generation. The thermoelectric compatibility factor (S) is a function of temperature and it depends on the Seebeck coefficient (α), given as (2)where α is the Seebeck coefficient in volts and T is temperature in Kelvin.
Now the evaluation of S in thermoelectric materials is needed in order to find out the possibility of the counterpart of the TE device, and it is also required to achieve the maximum thermoelectric efficiency. It is well known that the two different materials may be used in the segmented thermoelectric generator, if their thermoelectric compatibility factors are same or less than a factor of 2.64–66
The compatibility factors of bulk and nanostructured samples of Mg3Sb2−xBix (with x = 0 and 0.2) are computed and presented in Fig. 9. Interestingly, the compatibility factors of both the nanostructured samples are large enough at high temperature when compared to that of their respective bulk counterparts. The compatibility factor of the nanostructured Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 alloy was maximized to ∼+1.5 V−1 at 773 K. We also compared the compatibility factors of the present study with the compatibility factors of the several state-of-the-art p-type thermoelectric materials with high ZT, and the same is displayed in Fig. 9b. Interestingly, the compatibility factor of bulk nanostructured Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 alloy of the present study is observed to be comparable to that of the other state-of-the-art p-type thermoelectric materials with high ZT, as shown in Fig. 9b.67 Therefore, the bulk nanostructured Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 is a suitable p-type material for segmentation with a broad range of other state-of-the art TE materials (within about a factor of 2) to gain the highest efficiency benefit for the thermoelectric devices used in power generation. Thus, owing to the dual advantages of reasonably high ZT and the high value of the compatibility factor of the present bulk nanostructured Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 materials, they evolve as potentially good materials for the replacement of the segmentation with the other state-of-the-art p-type thermoelectric materials for use in thermoelectric device fabrication.

4. Conclusions and future prospects
Nanostructuring of Mg3Sb2−xBix (x = 0 & 0.2) employing high energy mechanical milling followed by spark plasma sintering (SPS) results in a significant increase in overall thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) in comparison with that of their respective normal bulk counterparts. A peak ZT ≈ 0.94 at 773 K for bulk nanostructured Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 alloy was optimized, which is about 55% higher when compared with its bulk counterpart (ZT = ∼0.6 for Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2) and >250% higher in comparison to the parent bulk Mg3Sb2 alloy (ZT ≈ 0.26 for Mg3Sb2). The enhancement in ZT is primarily due to a drastic reduction in thermal conductivity. The analysis of thermal conductivity data in the light of the macroscopic model proposed by Nan et al. reveals that the effect of grain boundary scattering on κ relates to the largest part of its cause and is genuine. In addition, this model also suggests that a further significant reduction of κ would occur if these bulk nanostructured samples could be prepared with sizes comparable to or even much smaller than the estimated Kapitza length of 54 nm at 323 K in the present investigation. It may be inferred here that the effect of nanostructuring on the reduction of thermal conductivity would be even more significant in those nanostructured materials that exhibit larger Kapitza resistances than these materials. Combined with the reasonably high ZT and high value of the compatibility factor of the present bulk nanostructured Mg3Sb1.8Bi0.2 materials, with their cheap, abundant, and non-toxic constituent elements (i.e. Mg, Sb, and Bi), they evolve as potentially good materials for utilization in the segmentation with the other state-of-the-art p-type thermoelectric materials when deployed to the process of thermoelectric device fabrication. We strongly believe that the present nanostructuring approach can be extended to other Zintl phase compounds for improving the thermoelectric properties, which has been seldom seen for this particular family of compounds.
