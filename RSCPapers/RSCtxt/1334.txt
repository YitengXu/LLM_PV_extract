    , Accepted 1st March 2021First published on 1st March 2021AbstractIn this paper, the electronic structure and transport properties of a ductile thermoelectric material α-Ag2S are examined using first-principles calculations combined with the Boltzmann transport equation within a constant relaxation-time approximation. The use of the exchange–correlation functional SCAN + rVV10 successfully describes the geometric and electronic structure of α-Ag2S with a direct bandgap value of 0.99 eV, which is consistent with the previous experimental observations. Based on the calculations of the formation energy of typical intrinsic defects, it is found that intrinsic defect formation greatly affects the conductivity of the system where silver vacancy and interstitial silver act as p-type and n-type defects, respectively. Large Seebeck coefficients at room-temperature, of around −760 μV K−1 for n-type and 1400 μV K−1 for p-type, are realized. It is also suggested that the doping of fully filled d-block elements such as Cu and Au not only maintained the Seebeck coefficients at high values but also improved electrical conductivity by more than 1.4 times, leading to the improvement of the power factor by up to 40% compared to the non-doped sample at low carrier concentration.
I. Introduction
Over the past decades, thermoelectric (TE) devices have always attracted attention as a green solution capable of converting waste heat into electrical energy.1–3 However, the bottleneck is that the energy conversion efficiency of TE devices remains relatively low. In general, this issue can be ameliorated by enhancing the dimensionless figure of merit (ZT), which is defined as follows: (1)where S is the Seebeck coefficient; σ is the electrical conductivity; and κe and κl are electronic and lattice thermal conductivities, respectively. In recent years, many efforts in the amendment of ZT are reported with impressive results.4–8 Obviously, we need high values of the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity while minimizing the value of thermal conductivity as much as possible for an enhancement of the ZT value. However, these coefficients are practically interdependent, making simultaneous improvement difficult. Nevertheless, optimizing the power factor (PF = S2σ) via doping and band engineering is still considered to be an effective approach for this problem. For example, Wang et al.9 used transition metals (TM) for doping in PbSe and got satisfactory results with ZT, which were optimized up to 1.2 at 873 K. Similarly, Shuai et al.10 observed a reasonable enhancement of the ZT value up to 1.6 by co-doping Bi and Ti in the GeTe compound.
Metal chalcogenides M2X (M = Cu, Ag, Au; X = S, Se, Te) belong to the I–VI semiconductor group and are well known for their interesting properties in the fields of supercapacitors, superconductors, photovoltaic solar cells, and flexible thermoelectrics. Among them, the compound silver sulfide (Ag2S) has wide-ranging applications. There are three polymorphisms in Ag2S depending on different temperature ranges: namely α-Ag2S (or acanthite; stable below 452 K), β-Ag2S (or argentite; stable above 453 K), and γ-Ag2S (stable above 860 K).11 Its low-temperature phase was found to have more potential and unique properties for TE applications above all else. Recently, for example, Shi et al.12 discovered the extraordinary ductility of the inorganic semiconductor α-Ag2S. Accordingly, at room temperature, α-Ag2S shows mechanical plasticity with a high plastic deformation capacity similar to that of metals as well as transport properties of semiconductors. This interesting property of α-Ag2S has almost not been observed previously for inorganic semiconductors. This discovery suggests that α-Ag2S can be used in flexible TE devices, which are a compromise between flexible electronics, efficient energy conversion, and mechanical plasticity. Although α-Ag2S shows special ductile properties, its TE performance is relatively low among the same semiconductor group Ag2(S, Se, Te). Therefore, it is necessary to improve the TE performance while keeping its good ductility. In the latest study, Liang et al.13 achieved a successful improvement of TE performance of Ag2S while maintaining its mechanical flexibility. Specifically, by doping the chalcogenide family's elements (Se and Te), the carrier concentration was significantly improved (from ∼1014 to ∼1019 cm−3). Also, the electronic mobility was increased, along with the electrical conductivity improved by more than five orders of magnitude compared to that in the pure sample. As a result, ZT values of up to 0.44 at 300 K and 0.66 at 450 K were achieved. It should be emphasized that for applications with different purposes, TE materials are generally divided into three main classes based on the temperature range, <400 K, 600–900 K, and >900 K.6 With its observed potential, Ag2S is expected to be a promising candidate for a low-temperature range TE material together with Bi2Te3 or PbTe.3 Furthermore, previous theoretical study14 has shown that Ag2S had ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity with a large anisotropy reflecting the crystal structure of the material. Therefore, for enhancing the ZT value, it is helpful to enhance the power factor and to have an insight into the influence of defects on the electronic structure of this kind of material.
So far, previous first-principles studies on α-Ag2S have mainly been conducted based on PBE exchange–correlation functional even though a large difference in the optimized geometrical structure compared to experimental structures15,16 has been recognized. This causes a significant difference in the calculated electronic structure as well as the contribution of impurities to the system. Additionally, studies of the formation of intrinsic defects and TE properties in α-Ag2S have been done in several groups,17–19 but an effect of TM doping on the TE properties is almost unreported.
Hence, in this paper, the electronic structure and transport properties of the monoclinic α-Ag2S phase in both non-doped and doped systems are investigated using band structure calculations and Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). A systematic investigation allows us to find the most suitable exchange–correlation functional for this particular system with empirical collation. As a result, the exchange–correlation functional SCAN + rVV10 is chosen and used in this work. It is found that Ag vacancies are acceptor defects in this material, whereas interstitial Ag atoms play a role as donor defects. A large Seebeck coefficient at room temperature of about −758 μV K−1 is predicted. Finally, the spin-dependent Seebeck coefficients and the effect of TM doping on transport properties of the system are discussed.
II. Computational methods
For density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we use the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method20 implemented in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.21 To reproduce the highly consistent crystal structure with experimental data, we systematically examine various commonly used exchange–correlation functionals, such as the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) proposed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE),22 the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA,23 and the hybrid functional proposed by Heyd, Scuseria and Ernzerhof (HSE06).24 Besides, van der Waals (vdW) forces25 are also included in a series of calculations to consider the contribution of non-local electron correlation using the optB86b-vdW functional26 or by adding the vdW corrections in the above functionals: PBE-MBD@rsSCS,27 PBE-dDsC,28 SCAN + rVV10,29 and HSE06-D3.30
In this work, the 4d10 and 5s1 orbitals of Ag as well as the 3s2 and 3p4 orbitals of S are treated as the valence states. All optimization calculations were converged until the residual atomic force became less than 10−2 eV Å−1. A cut-off energy of 400 eV and a width of 0.05 eV of Gaussian smearing is used for all calculations. The k-point mesh was 9 × 9 × 9 Monkhorst–Pack grids for unit-cell calculations of most functionals, while 8 × 4 × 4 mesh is used for the hybrid functionals. The optimized structures using a variety of functionals are discussed in the next section. For formation energy calculations, supercells with different sizes representing different impurity concentrations are used as 2 × 1 × 1 (24 atoms), 2 × 2 × 1 (48 atoms), and 2 × 2 × 2 (96 atoms) with corresponding Monkhorst–Pack k-meshes of 3 × 5 × 5, 3 × 3 × 5, and 5 × 5 × 5. All atoms in the supercells are relaxed, keeping the dimensions of cells fixed. For band structure calculations, the spin–orbit coupling effect is not considered in this framework.
The electronic transport properties are obtained using BOLTZWANN code31 integrated into the WANNIER90 package,32 which solves the semiclassical BTE in the constant relaxation-time approximation. The expressions for the tensors of σ and S as functions of chemical potential (μ) and absolute temperature (T) are the following: (2) (3)where f(E,μ,T) is the Fermi–Dirac distribution function and  is the transport distribution function, which is defined as (4)where En,k is the energy for band n at wave vector k and νi,j is the component of group velocity at (n, k), and τnk is the lifetime of electron–phonon scattering. Here, we employed a dense k-mesh of 50 × 50 × 50 to interpolate the band structure using maximally localized Wannier functions.33,34 The transport distribution function was sampled within a bin width of 0.05 meV. In the constant relaxation-time approximation framework, the value of τnk = τ = 10 fs was used and gave reasonable results to those derived from experimental observation.35 All TE property calculations were conducted on the supercell 2 × 1 × 1.
III. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structure optimization of α-Ag2S
The experimental lattice parameters of α-Ag2S indicate a monoclinic structure which belong to the space group P21/c with cell parameters of a = 4.231 Å, b = 6.930 Å, c = 9.526 Å; α = γ = 90° and β = 125.48°.36 As shown in Table 1, our performance using the PBE functional produces lattice parameters consistent with previous theoretical values.14,15,18,37 However, it should be noted that calculations using the PBE functional show a slight deviation in the lattice structure, especially for the lattice constant b which is overestimated by up to 1 Å compared to the experimental value. This can lead to the variation in the electronic structure even though its bandgap value obtained was quite close to that of the experimental data. The HSE06 hybrid functional in this case also faces a similar problem, in which not only the lattice constants are incorrectly reproduced but also the bandgap energy is overestimated significantly, as shown in Fig. 1.

 Fig. 1  Bandgap energies of α-Ag2S calculated using different exchange–correlation functionals. Almost functionals show a direct bandgap except in the case of GGA-PBE. The experimental result is referenced for comparison as a red dashed line.12 
The key to this problem may come from the particular structure of α-Ag2S where silver and sulfur atoms are arranged in layered chains with zig-zag shape (see Fig. 2a), suggesting that the contribution of the vdW force may significantly affect the stability of the structure. Obviously, the value of lattice constant b decreases dramatically when the vdW force is included (see Table 1). Unsurprisingly, the results indicate that functionals like optB86-vdW, PBE-dDsC, and PBE-MBD@rsSCS, which usually underestimate bandgap energy in semiconductors38 give a good description of the lattice parameters but fail to estimate the bandgap of the system. The hybrid functional HSE06 combined with the dispersion force parametrized in the form of damping function-D3 has a good effect of predicting the length of b due to the addition of the long-range interaction of the vdW force. The issue of overestimating the bandgap energy using the hybrid functions was also reported for TM oxides,39 but it was solved by controlling the mixing parameter α and screening parameter ω for the separation range of the Coulomb potential.40 We also examined the α and ω dependence of bandgap energy for this case. The results can be found in Supplementary material I (ESI†). However, even when the bandgap problem is solved, this method is computationally demanding and is not practical for calculations involving a large number of atoms in systems such as α-Ag2S (12 atoms per unit cell).

It is known that the SCAN functional improves atomization energies even more than GGA and retains intermediate-range interactions from LDA that have been nearly eliminated in GGA.29 Recently, some studies in the literature have used SCAN functional as a new approach compared to common DFT methods, where both successes and deficiencies have been reported when it is applied to different material systems.41–46 In the case of the Ag2S system, lattice constant overestimation can be caused by errors from unfavorable interatomic density overlap, making lattice constants larger than the experimental values.23,47 This is a common error of the PBE functional, especially in describing vdW bonded systems. Therefore, we expect that the SCAN functional can solve these issues by introducing the orbital kinetic energy density into the functional, which has the ability to appropriately treat different chemical bonds. As can be seen from Table 1, lattice constant b under the description of SCAN method has dropped significantly when collated with GGA, but both this value and bandgap are still overestimated. Among the functionals considered here, the combination of SCAN with the non-local correlation functional rVV10 for long-range vdW interactions (or SCAN + rVV10) yields a better-than-expected result: a = 4.18 Å, b = 6.96 Å, c = 9.52 Å, and β = 124.53° with a bandgap energy of 0.99 eV. In terms of the electronic structure, Fig. 3 illustrates the partial density of states (pDOS) calculated from the GGA, SCAN, SCAN + rVV10, and optB86-vdW functionals at the same k-meshes for comparison. In general, the SCAN functional gives a description of both Ag d-states and S p-states that is quite similar to the GGA functional, and only the density of Ag d-orbitals is denser near the top of VB than the one in the GGA. At the same time, the CB region tends to push upwards, expanding the bandgap energy larger than the GGA functional. Under the influence of vdW interaction, both SCAN + rVV10 and optB86-vdW functionals tend to pull the CB region to near VB maximum than the SCAN functional. However, the large downward shift of the CB region in the case of optB86-vdW makes the bandgap energy shrink (only 0.71 eV) much more than the SCAN + rVV10 or GGA functional. This is also a drawback of vdW functional in bandgap prediction. Lastly, in the case of SCAN + rVV10, the d-states at the top of VB are slightly pulled towards the negative energy region (below the Fermi level) with lower density than the SCAN description, resulting in a reasonable bandgap energy of 0.99 eV. Therefore, for our purpose, it is clear that the SCAN + rVV10 functional gives a good description in solving the geometric and bandgap issues for the Ag2S system. Hereinafter, the functional SCAN + rVV10 is used for our DFT calculations.

3.2 Electronic structure and intrinsic defect formation in α-Ag2S
As shown in Fig. 4, the calculated band structure of α-Ag2S using the SCAN + rVV10 functional shows that both valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are located at the Γ point of the first Brillouin zone (BZ) with a bandgap of 0.99 eV. This result is consistent with the previous experimental observation of monoclinic α-Ag2S: a direct bandgap semiconductor of 1.1 eV.12 The VBs ranging from −6 eV to 0 eV relative to the Fermi level are formed mainly by 4d-Ag and 3p-S orbitals. Meanwhile, the hybridization of both S and Ag states forms the CB. It should be noted that the band structure from different vdW functionals also produced similar results with SCAN + rVV10 except bandgap energy (the bandgap using other vdW functionals was underestimated). PBE functional in our preliminary work (see Supplementary material II, ESI†) and other theoretical studies show CBM point displaced from the center of BZ, resulting in an indirect bandgap with a value of 0.95 eV.

Fermi level (red dashed line) is referenced at the top of the valence band. 
Intrinsic defects play an essential role in the properties of semiconductors. We consider the common intrinsic defects such as vacancies, interstitials, and anti-site defects. In the Ag2S compound, while the S atoms are arranged on an immutable sublattice, the Ag atoms have a moving sublattice.48 The number of Ag atoms occupied at the tetrahedral-site (AgI) and octahedral-site (AgII) is also slightly smaller than the number of equivalent positions in the lattice. Moreover, the energy barrier between these positions is small enough for them to diffuse easily.49 The mobility of Ag becomes more pronounced as the temperature increases. Accordingly, the caterpillar mechanism50 or cooperative ionic transport was observed when diffusion of one Ag atom led to the diffusion of the others, allowing them to occupy new lattice positions and leave unoccupied positions alternately. This can make the formation of Ag vacancy easier than that of S vacancy. The crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP)51 also indicates an anti-bonding state Ag–S below the Fermi level (see Fig. 4c). In general, anti-bonding states appearing at the Fermi level result in an instability of the structure. Therefore, these systems have a tendency toward a magnetic or structural phase transition to eliminate the anti-bonding contributions.52 This anti-bonding characteristic also can be found in the chalcopyrite family (e.g. AgSbTe2, CuInSe2, CuFeS2), CuGaO2, and CuAlO2 with many interesting physical properties.53–58 In such systems, the acceptor defects such as Ag/Cu vacancies are often predominant, and the instability of the system can be ameliorated by electron removal to get higher ionicity. When an acceptor is introduced (in this work it is an Ag vacancy), some electrons are removed from VB, which leads to low formation energy of the acceptors. Because acceptor defects become dominant, the anti-bonding nature can be eliminated. This results in an increase in the stability of the systems. Therefore, the appearance of anti-bonding interactions Ag–S under the Fermi level can be a clue to predict the possibility of vacancy formation in this kind of system. Besides, the bonding AgI–S is more positive (more anti-bonding features) than the AgII–S below the Fermi level. This may be related to the favored position of the vacancy at the tetrahedral and octahedral sites.
The formation energy of defect systems Ef(q) in charge state q as a function of Fermi level is defined as follows:59 (5)where Etotdefect(q) is the total energy of supercell with a defect in charge state q; Etotbulk is the total energy of bulk system; n is the number of host atom removed from the system (n < 0) or the number of impurity atoms doped into the system (n > 0); and μi is the chemical potential of element i. Here, EVBM is referenced by the VBM of the defect-free system. ΔEFermi is the Fermi energy relative to the VBM. The chemical potential of the system is defined by thermodynamic equilibrium conditions as 2μAg + μS = μα-Ag2S(bulk)(6) μAg ≤ μbulkAg + ΔμAg(7) μAg ≤ μbulkAg + ΔμAg(8)where μα-Ag2S(bulk) is the chemical potential of α-Ag2S system (= −72.10 eV), and μAg and μS are the chemical potential of Ag and S calculated from fcc Ag bulk and S8 molecule, respectively. Note that we mainly consider two synthesized conditions, namely Ag-rich conditions with μAg = μbulkAg = −31.16 eV and S-rich conditions with μS = μbulkS = −9.53 eV. Besides, chemical potentials of the other elements are computed for the formation energy of doping cases, as shown in Table 2. A correction term ΔV can also be considered to control the accuracy of eqn (5). In the present calculations, we simply used core potential correction for this term.

The calculated DOS of α-Ag2S with vacancies AgI, AgII, or S at a concentration of 1.04% are shown in Fig. 5a–c. By introducing Ag vacancies, the Fermi level moves from the VBM into the valence band, namely Ag vacancy behaves as an acceptor defect. On the other hand, the S vacancy does not act as an n-type defect. The Fermi level is still located at the VBM, and sharp peaks appear around the CBM. Observing the optimized atomic configuration around the S vacancy site (see Supplementary material III, ESI†), Ag atoms around the S vacancy tend to gather into a cluster. Their shortest bond length is even shorter than in fcc Ag bulk. These stable bonds can be the reason for the non-shifting of the Fermi level in the S vacancy. Also, formation energies in Fig. 6 indicate that Ag vacancies are formed more easily under S-rich conditions than Ag-rich conditions, while S vacancies tend to dominate under Ag-rich conditions.

 Fig. 6  The formation energy of α-Ag2S in the presence of intrinsic defects as a function of Fermi level under the (a) Ag-rich and (b) S-rich conditions. The horizontal axis represents bandgap energy, where the zero value of Fermi level corresponds to the VBM. 
Under Ag-rich conditions, the formation energies of Ag vacancies in the two charged states 0 and −1, namely VAgI0, VAgII0, VAgI−1, and VAgII−1 are 0.79, 0.86, 0.62, and 0.67 eV at ΔEFermi = 0 (VBM), respectively. Under S-rich conditions, these values are 0.67, 0.74, 0.50, and 0.55 eV, respectively. This means that the vacancy tends to be charged in the state q = −1 (receiving an electron) rather than being maintained in an electrically neutral state at ΔEFermi = 0. The vacancy formation energy at the tetrahedral-site is also smaller than that at the octahedral-site. However, this difference is not so significant, only about 0.07 eV. This result corresponds to the higher anti-bonding state of AgI–S compared to AgII–S as observed before (see Fig. 4c), even though this difference is small. This means that both tetrahedral and octahedral sites can be viewed as a potential vacancy formation site, but tetrahedral sites are more favored vacancy formation sites than octahedral ones based on the calculated formation energy and COHP argument.
The charge transition state is taken into account in the S vacancy case with q = 0, +1, +2. The corresponding energy values of V0S, VS+1, and VS+2 are, respectively, 0.87, 1.08, and 1.32 eV under Ag-rich conditions, while at S-rich conditions these are 1.1, 1.32, and 1.55 eV. Unlike the Ag vacancy, it is clear that the S vacancy tends to remain electrically neutral rather than in the charged state. Evidently, the formation energies of states +1 and +2 are higher than the neutral state. Additionally, the energy transfer point of 0/+1 and +1/+2 is also out of the bandgap limit, indicating the difficulty of formation of these charged states for S vacancy. Clearly, the calculated formation energy shows that S vacancy is not energetically favored compared to Ag vacancy. Therefore, we have estimated the vacancy concentration of the energy-favored vacancies using the following equation:59 c = NsitesNconfigexp(−Ef/kBT)(9)Here, Nsites is the number of sites per unit volume in the lattice where the defect can be incorporated, and Nconfig is the equivalent configuration number which the defect can take (Nconfig = 1 in the case of vacancy, anti-site atom, or substitutional atom). Ef is the formation energy of defect, kB is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature. The results are listed in Table 3. Accordingly, the concentrations of VAgI−1, VAgII−1, and V0S for Ag-rich conditions at room-temperature are 1.52 × 1012, 2.21 × 1011, and 3.96 × 107 cm−3, respectively. These values for the S-rich case are 1.58 × 1014, 2.28 × 1013, and 4.49 × 103 cm−3, respectively. It is found that Ag vacancy formation is more dominant compared to the formation of S vacancy, and its concentration is also higher under S-rich conditions. In contrast, S vacancy concentration is higher under Ag-rich conditions. These calculated results are consistent with the earlier predictions49,50 about the predominance of the Ag vacancy caused by their mobility.

In contrast to the vacancies, interstitial Ag acts as a donor as shown in Fig. 5d. Specifically, interstitial S and Ag atoms were doped independently into the system but only the interstitial Ag case exhibited n-type defects with energies of 1.56 eV, much lower than the energy of S atom of 2.15 eV under Ag-rich conditions. Meanwhile, the anti-site defect has a formation energy of 1.02 eV and is easier to form than both interstitial cases. Nonetheless, considering the ionic state of the interstitial Ag+ case, the formation energy of this defect showed the lowest values among the others in both synthesized conditions, only about 0.14 eV under the Ag-rich conditions or 0.26 eV under the S-rich conditions. It turns out that Ag+ is much easier to form in the system than the neutral state, which fits well with the charged vacancy formation tendency. This is in good agreement with the previous experimental works,60,61 which claims that Frenkel type (complexes of vacancy and interstitial atoms) is the main defect in the non-stoichiometric Ag2+δS compound. Accordingly, it can be described by the Kröger–Vink notation as follows: (10)where [Agi] is the interstitial Ag atom;  is the ion state of the interstitial Ag atom; [VAg] is Ag vacancy; and  is the charged state of Ag vacancy. Here, the interstitial Ag atom is completely decomposed into Ag ⇄ Ag+ + e− as the thermodynamic neutralizing factor, which provides free electron or annihilation with charged vacancy.48 Therefore, one can see that both interstitial Ag and Ag vacancy are the most favored defects, and they act as n-type and p-type defects, respectively.
3.3 Effect of transition metals doping on the transport properties of α-Ag2S
The transport properties of α-Ag2S have been investigated based on Boltzmann transport theory. Due to the monoclinic crystal structure, we find a large directional anisotropy in the transport properties. The directional anisotropy of the Seebeck coefficient becomes clearer at temperatures from 300 to 450 K, while at low temperatures, this distinction is negligible (see Supplementary material IV, ESI†). In Fig. 7, the calculated carrier concentration dependence of the Seebeck coefficients and electrical conductivity in both n-type and p-type are shown. At the same concentration, the Seebeck coefficient for p-type shows a higher value, which is almost double the value obtained from n-type doping. In particular, at a concentration of 1018 cm−3, the Seebeck coefficient is about 630 μV K−1 for the p-type and about −380 μV K−1 for the n-type. However, the high Seebeck coefficient is not enough for the improvement of the TE efficiency. Observing the electrical conductivity value, one can see that this parameter increases very rapidly when the carrier concentration becomes about 1017 to 1018 cm−3, and it reaches about 700 S m−1 for n-type. In fact, the carrier concentrations reported in the α-Ag2S samples are relatively low, about 1013–1014 cm−3.12,13 This results in a poor TE performance of the α-Ag2S. Therefore, it is important to improve the electrical conductivity while maintaining the Seebeck coefficient at a high value. In this work, TM doping is used for the purpose of improving the electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient simultaneously. Nonetheless, doping random transition metals does not always help in improving the TE performance. For example, to obtain an improvement of the Seebeck coefficient, it is expected that not only the appearance of sharp peaks at the end of either VB or CB, but also a large bandgap energy is required. Because of the unfilled d-block characteristic, elements such as Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Cr, and Ni are expected to form sharp peaks at VB or CB as observed before in SiGe alloys.62 Meanwhile, the d-electrons of noble metals (Cu, Ag, and Au) tend to make a major contribution to within a few eV below the Fermi level in the VB. Therefore, the bandgap energy of the host material can be maintained. For that purpose, here we consider two groups of TMs: the first group consists of magnetic elements characterized by an incomplete inner d-shell such as Ti, V, Fe, and Mn, and the second group includes non-magnetic elements, Cu and Au, where d-states are fully filled.
 Fig. 7  Calculated Seebeck coefficients (red color) and electrical conductivity (navy color) of α-Ag2S in the case of n-type and p-type dopings at different carrier concentrations at T = 300 K. 
First, we take into account the possibility of substitutional impurity atoms based on the formation energy at different concentrations, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 8. It is worth noting here that impurity atoms replace the host Ag atom in the tetrahedral-site as it is preferred energetically over the octahedral-site. In general, impurities are easier to form at low concentrations, but in the Mn-doped case impurities become easier to form when the doping concentration in the system increases. Besides, Cu is also believed to be easier to form with formation energy around 0.03 eV at 1.04% concentration. Meanwhile, Fe has the highest formation energy of about 0.98 eV, revealing the difficulty of forming. In summary, the doping of elements such as Mn, Ti, Cu, and Au is believed to be easier than other elements, this will be more clear when considering the electronic structure of the doping system. However, it should be admitted that the real substitution process of foreign atoms at Ag positions is more complicated than just simply replacing atom by atom due to the difference of favored states between Ag atom and TM atom. Hence, in the present work, the Ag-rich synthesized conditions are used for doping processes to reduce as much as possible the formation of extra Ag vacancy. The formation of defect complex systems as a combination between two vacancies and substitutional atom will be investigated in future work with meticulous attention.

According to the present calculated results, Ti-, V-, Fe-, Mn-doped systems become magnetic while Cu- and Au-doped systems become non-magnetic. In the case of Ti-doped system shown in Fig. 9a, there is some difference between the spin-up and spin-down states of DOS. In the spin-up state, the impurity energy level appears at the bottom of the conduction band. This is formed mainly from the contribution of the 3d orbital of Ti, leading to a significant contraction of the bandgap energy. Above the Fermi level (a few eV), the hybridization of states between Ti and S forms markedly in the CB, while it contributes very little to the VB. At the same time, no appearance of impurity peak but the shift of the Fermi level into the CB leads to the system almost becomes a metal proposing that the Seebeck value decreases drastically as shown in Fig. 10a.

 Fig. 10  The spin-dependent Seebeck coefficients as functions of temperature in the case of magnetic elements doping in different crystal directions. The left-hand subfigures show spin-up states and right-hand subfigures show spin-down states. 
Similarly, the impurity peak also forms in a spin-up state in the case of the V-doped system (see Fig. 9b). The appearance of d-states as the shallow level at the bottom of CB leads to bandgap reduction. For the Fe-doped system, d-orbitals due to the iron donation are observed in the spin-down state instead of spin-up like Ti and V cases. Furthermore, the impurity peak in the V and Fe cases is not connected to either the top of VB or the bottom of CB. These peaks appear in the bandgap with the main contribution from the impurity showing an unstable state. This can be the reason why their formation energy becomes higher than others, as mentioned above. Meanwhile, the Fermi level at the spin-up state of Fe is located at the bottom of CB, suggesting the significant difference in Seebeck coefficients of two spin-states of Fe case (see Fig. 9c). In the case of the Mn-doped system, the Fermi level is entirely shifted into the CB in both spin-states, without the appearance of shallow donor levels as shown in Fig. 9d. Instead, there is a hybridization of states in the spin-down state of CB and also the spin-up state of VB at the same energy levels of Mn and Ag. Therefore, the Seebeck coefficient obtained is almost as small as metals (see Fig. 10d). The contribution of states in both VB and CB of Mn may lead to the easier formation of Mn impurities in the system than other elements in terms of energy as observed before. Note that we also checked the other magnetic elements, such as Co, Cr, and Ni, for doping processes. However, a similar trend was observed in the presence of impurity peaks in the middle of the bandgap, leading to a significant decrease in the bandgap energy that makes the system metallic. Therefore, only calculated results for some representative magnetic dopants are given here.
The Seebeck coefficients of magnetic metal doping systems are significantly reduced compared to the non-doped system due to the formation of impurity states that make the systems almost metallic. The average values of Seebeck coefficients at 300 K in Ti-doped, V-doped, and Mn-doped systems shown in Fig. 10 are very low: 18, 25, 30 μV K−1 for the spin-up states and 33, 55, 2 μV K−1 for the spin-down states, respectively. In the Fe-doped case, our results confirmed a large difference in the Seebeck coefficients between the spin-up and spin-down states with values of 150 μV K−1 and 12 μV K−1, respectively. Besides, it can be seen that there is a difference in values depending on different crystal directions. The anisotropic effect becomes more pronounced in the presence of impurity peaks as can be seen in the Seebeck coefficients of spin-up state in the Ti- and V-doped systems or those of the spin-down state in the Fe-doped system, showing the maximum values in the z-axis. The same effect was observed previously in the lattice thermal conductivity of α-Ag2S, which was caused by the anisotropic structure of the monoclinic phase.14 Therefore, it is clear that the high reduction in the bandgap energy in the case of doping magnetic elements is not favorable for improving the TE performance.
The calculated electronic structure of non-magnetic metal-doped systems such as Cu and Au shows the homogeneity of states between spin-up and spin-down (see Fig. 9e and f). Instead of generating impurity peaks, the 3d states of Cu and 5d states of Au mainly contribute to the VB in the systems. The Fermi level is located in the middle of the bandgap and we find slight decreases of the bandgap energy to 0.92 for Cu-doped and 0.87 eV for Au-doped systems. Clearly, retaining a large bandgap can maintain a large Seebeck coefficient. It should be noted that the anisotropic nature of the Seebeck coefficients in Cu- and Au-doping were also observed with a deviation of about 10 μV K−1 in different directions. Since in a real experiment, a sample is generally polycrystalline, the average value of Seebeck coefficient in different crystal directions (11) (Supplementary material V, ESI†) is taken for a fair comparison with the experimental results: (11)
In the absence of doping, the calculated Seebeck value of α-Ag2S shows −758 μV K−1 at 300 K, which agrees well with the observed experimental results from −802 μV K−1 to −920 μV K−1 at n = 1014 cm−3,12,35 as shown in Fig. 11a. In the case of doped systems, Cu- and Au-doping yields the Seebeck coefficient of −768 μV K−1 and −766 μV K−1, respectively, at 300 K. Also, the results are shown in Fig. 11b suggests a significant improvement in the electrical conductivity. Specifically, the conductivity coefficients in both doped systems are improved by about 1.4 times from 91.39 S m−1 to 123.75 S m−1 for the Cu-doped system and 120.83 S m−1 for the Au-doped system at 450 K. This improvement reaches a maximum of 158.76 and 166.35 S m−1 for Cu-doped and Au-doped systems, respectively, in the z-direction. Finally, the power factor, which is the product of the square of Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity, is shown in Fig. 11c. Our theoretical calculations suggest that Cu- and Au-doped systems achieve higher electrical conductivities and lead to a significant improvement of the power factor up to 0.46 μV cm−1 K−2 compared with 0.33 μV cm−1 K−2 in the non-doped system at 450 K. This means that the power factor of α-Ag2S is enhanced by about 40% by doping Cu or Au at low carrier concentration. For higher carrier concentration, we also estimated the change of power factor in the doped system by increasing the carrier concentration to 1016 and 1018 cm−3. Accordingly, Seebeck coefficients gradually decrease as the carrier concentration increases. At n = 1016 cm−3, these values yield −598, −616, −614 μV K−1 at 300 K for undoped, Cu-doped, and Au-doped systems, respectively. At n = 1018 cm−3, Seebeck coefficients keep decreasing to values of −380, −409, and −401 μV K−1 for undoped, Cu-doped, and Au-doped systems, respectively. On the contrary, the electrical conductivity is proportional to the carrier concentration and increases very rapidly with the increase of temperature. The estimated maximum values at 450 K for the Cu-doped and Au-doped system reach 344.20 and 340.35 S m−1 at n = 1016 cm−3, while these are 1673.14 and 1735.29 S m−1 at n = 1018 cm−3. Obviously, these values are significantly improved when compared with the undoped system, which is 289.26 S m−1 at n = 1016 cm−3 and 1544.99 S m−1 at n = 1018 cm−3, respectively. As a result, the maximum values of power factor at 450 K in the Cu-doped and Au-doped systems are boosted to 22% and 21% at n = 1016 cm−3. By increasing the concentration to n = 1018 cm−3, these values are improved about 17% and 17.5% compared to the undoped system. For the doping strategy, the maximum power factor achieved by TM doping can be enhanced up to 40% at low carrier concentrations. At higher carrier concentrations, this value gradually decreases. Therefore, depending on the purpose one can control the carrier concentrations in the system to achieve the desired highest thermoelectric performance.

IV. Conclusions
In this paper, the defect formation and transport properties of α-Ag2S were investigated using the first-principles electronic structure calculations and the Boltzmann theory within constant relaxation-time approximation. By examining various functionals, we found the exchange–correlation functional SCAN + rVV10 gave a good description of the geometric structure and physical properties of α-Ag2S. Therefore, this functional was chosen in the present band structure calculations. From the analysis of intrinsic defect formation, it was found that the predominance of Ag vacancy acts as a p-type defect while interstitial Ag atom induces n-type conductivity. The charged defect transfer was also discussed, and it was made clear that the predominant intrinsic defect is VAgI−1 with a concentration of about 1.58 × 1014 cm−3 under the S-rich synthesized conditions. This is contrary to the charge-neutral tendency of S vacancy. The transport properties of the non-doped α-Ag2S system show a large Seebeck coefficient of −758 μV K−1 (n = 1014 cm−3 for n-type) at room temperature, which is consistent with the experimental results. To enhance the power factor in the α-Ag2S system, some TM dopings were considered. The magnetic TM-doped systems (TM = Ti, V, Fe, and Mn) show a significant reduction in the bandgap energy due to the major contribution of d orbitals around the Fermi level. On the other hand, Cu- and Au-doped systems maintain bandgap energies of 0.92 and 0.87 eV, respectively. These maintained bandgap energies in Cu- and Au-doped systems keep the high Seebeck coefficients of the non-doped α-Ag2S, while increasing the electrical conductivity. These high Seebeck coefficients and enhanced electrical conductivities result in a significant improvement of the power factor about 40% compared to the undoped system at 450 K in the case of low carrier concentration (e.g. n = 1014 cm−3). In the case of higher carrier concentrations, the power factor slightly improved, reaching the maximum values of 23% and 17.5% at n = 1016 and n = 1018 cm−3, respectively. In conclusion, the low formation energies and the ability to improve the power factor suggest that Cu and Au are potential dopants for improving the TE efficiency of α-Ag2S.

 	Fig. 1  Bandgap energies of α-Ag2S calculated using different exchange–correlation functionals. Almost functionals show a direct bandgap except in the case of GGA-PBE. The experimental result is referenced for comparison as a red dashed line.12	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Geometrical structure of low-temperature phase α-Ag2S with a monoclinic shape where silver ordered in both tetrahedral-site (AgI) and octahedral-site (AgII) (yellow atom: S, silver atom: Ag); (b) supercell 2 × 2 × 2 with some kinds of intrinsic defects such as vacancies (VAgI, VAgII, VS: black atom), interstitial atoms (IS, IAg: red atom), substitutional atoms (TMs: green atom), and anti-site atoms (cyan and magenta atom).	 

 	Fig. 3  pDOS at the same k-meshes of GGA, SCAN, SCAN + rVV10, and optB86-vdW functionals. Fermi level (red dashed line) is referenced at top of VB. Bandgap energy (light pink area) is also marked for comparison.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Band structure in high symmetry k-paths of the first-Brillouin zone; (b) total- and partial-DOS of α-Ag2S using functional SCAN + rVV10; (c) COHP of Ag–S bonding, the negative region (black arrow towards the left-hand side) illustrates bonding nature while positive region (black arrow towards the right-hand side) represents anti-bonding nature. Fermi level (red dashed line) is referenced at the top of the valence band.
