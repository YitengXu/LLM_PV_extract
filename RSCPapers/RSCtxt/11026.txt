    , Accepted 17th July 2013First published on 17th July 2013AbstractFour novel metal-free organic sensitizers based on 5,7-dihexyl-6,12-diphenyl-5,7-dihydroindolo[2,3-b]carbazole (DDC) donors have been synthesized. Their optical/electrochemical properties, dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSCs) performances and photo-stability upon successive irradiation for 30 min have been investigated. The optical data indicates that all these dyes showed a high molar extinction coefficient (5.6–6.3 × 104 M−1 cm−1). Under standard global AM 1.5 solar light condition, the DDC4 sensitized cell gave a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 14.81 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.688 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.69, corresponding to an overall efficiency (η) of 7.03%. The benzothiadiazole units and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) in the π spacer were found to increase the photo-stability of the corresponding dyes and these dyes based on this donor are promising candidates for the further application in DSSCs.
Introduction
With the depletion of fossil energy, the energy problems need to be confronted more and more and solved day by day.1 Among several promising candidates, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on Ru-complex dyes have been reported with light-to-electricity efficiency (η) as high as 11.5%.2 However, Ru-complex dyes are not suitable for cost-effective and environmentally friendly photovoltaic systems since they contain the noble metal ruthenium which may limit their widespread application in DSSCs.3 Compared with metal complexes, organic dyes have the advantages of environmental friendliness, higher structural flexibility, lower cost, easier preparation and purification, etc.4 Most organic dyes are composed of a donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) dipolar structure due to its effective photo-induced intramolecular charge transfer characteristic.5
The molar extinction coefficient of sensitizers in the visible light region (ε) is an important factor that influences the DSSCs efficiency. Generally, a high ε means a good light harvesting ability, thus it will contribute to a large short-circuit current density (Jsc).5e The photo-stability of dyes is also an important factor and it will pose a great influence on the long-term stability of DSSCs.6 As to be promisingly applied in the future DSSCs, a donor should help the corresponding dyes to produce a high ε in order to harvest as many photoelectrons as possible. Besides, the donor should be able to stabilize the oxidized dyes upon light irradiation in order to reinforce the photo-stability of dyes.6 In addition, the synthesis and purification of the donor should be easy. However, as far as we know, donors based on the above factors in DSSCs were seldom designed. Considering this point, here, we report a new donor 5,7-dihexyl-6,12-diphenyl-5,7-dihydroindolo[2,3-b]carbazole (DDC) with an easier preparation and purification process. The considerations are as follows: (1) carbazole is an excellent donor which has very strong electron donating ability.7 The new donor DDC contains two fused carbazole units and can be expected to have stronger donating ability; (2) the two fused carbazole units consist of a large π-plane, which could desirably delocalize the generated cation as well as reinforce the photo-stability of the corresponding dyes.8 The effective conjugation of these two fused carbazole units could be expected to contribute to a high molar extinction coefficient; (3) the two alkyl chains attached on the two nitrogen atoms will efficiently improve the solubility in common organic solvents; (4) with the coefficient of both the free rotation of the two phenyl rings connected to the indolo[3,2-b]carbazole core and the nonlinear structure of this donor, a controlled aggregation on TiO2 could be anticipated; (5) the synthesis and purification of this new donor by our methodology (in the synthesis part) is very easy. As to the π-spacer, benzothiadiazole can stabilize the charge-separated excited-state,9 therefore, high photo-stability of dyes could be accessible.10 In addition, as an electron-withdrawing group in the π-spacer part, benzothiadiazole could result in a striking red-shift of the absorption spectrum of the corresponding dyes.9 Thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) is an excellent π-spacer, it has been reported that the TT compound offers better π-conjugation and smaller geometric relaxation energy upon oxidation.11 However, as far as we know, the photo-stability of dyes containing the TT moiety as a π-spacer has not been reported, therefore the investigation on the photo-stability of TT containing dyes seems interesting. Based on the above considerations, four new dyes based on DDC donors (Scheme 1), containing benzothiadiazole (or thiophene) and TT (or thiophene) as π-spacer, 2-cyanoacetic acid as acceptor, were designed and synthesized. In order to investigate whether the two fused carbazole units from the donor are good for the DSSCs performance and the stability of dyes upon light irradiation, CBZ with an N-alkyl carbazole unit donor, was also synthesized as the reference dye.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic route to the four dyes DDC1–DDC4 containing the DDC moiety and reference dye CBZ with the carbazole moiety were depicted in Scheme 2. The intermediate 1 was obtained from the condensation reaction of 1H-indole and benzaldehyde under the catalysis of iodine in CH3CN, which employed the procedure previously reported by Mohit L. Deb.12a However, the products obtained were identified as not the reported product DDCX, but the product (compound 1 in Scheme 2) exhibiting a different configuration where the two nitrogen atoms connected with the central six-membered ring are ex situ to each other. Moreover, the central six-membered ring was not aromatized. The real structure was identified as 1 which was directly characterized by NMR and indirectly by DDC which was further characterized by X-ray crystallography (Fig. 1). The DDC were synthesized by the alkylation of 1, followed by the oxidation reaction by DDQ. The synthesis of DDC was very simple with high yields and the purification did not necessarily employ column chromatography, suggesting that its synthesis could be carried out in mass production. The bromination of DDC gave the key intermediate DDC–Br. The intermediates B1, B2 were synthesized according to our previous work.9bB3 and B4 were obtained by repeated bromination and Suzuki Coupling reaction and the starting material 3 was synthesized by four step reactions according to a previous report.12b The final products were obtained via Suzuki coupling of DDC–Br with B1–B4, followed by the condensation with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of a catalytic amount of piperidine in THF. The procedure to synthesize reference dye CBZ from easily obtained intermediate 8 was very similar to that of DDC1. The purification of intermediates was performed by flash column chromatography and subsequent HPLC. All the intermediates and target dyes were characterized by standard spectroscopic methods including 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRMS. Clearly, except the intermediates 1 and 2 which are not very stable in solution, all the intermediates are fairly stable.

Optical properties
UV/Vis absorption spectra of the five dyes in a diluted solution of THF (1 × 10−5 M) are shown in Fig. 2(a) and their absorption data are listed in Table 1. In the visible light region, the dyes DDC1–DDC4 all exhibit three absorption bands: the major and broad absorption band is located at 440–650 nm with the maximum absorptions at 453, 522, 464, 522 nm, respectively, which is ascribed to the charge transfer (CT) transition between the donor and the acceptor,13 the high intensity of this band is well-correlated with the large value of oscillator strength (Table 1); the other two narrower absorption bands which are not completely separated off are located at 350–440 nm and the maximum absorptions are almost located at the same positions around 402 and 421 nm, respectively, which may be resulted from the localized aromatic π–π* transitions.13 The intensity of π–π* transitions is higher than that of the charge-transfer transitions. The reference dye CBZ displays only one absorption band at 350–650 nm with the maximum absorption at 461 nm which is slightly red-shifted compared to the CT band of DDC1. For the dyes DDC1–DDC4, the corresponding maximum molar extinction coefficients for the CT band are quite high, they are 6.31 × 104, 5.63 × 104, 5.97 × 104 and 5.95 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively, which exhibit a striking enhancement compared to that for the dye CBZ (3.61 × 104 M−1 cm−1). The maximum molar extinction coefficients for the two absorption bands of DDC1–DDC4 at 350–440 nm are also very high, reaching up to around 5 × 104 and 7 × 104 M−1 cm−1.

The high molar extinction coefficients for DDC1–DDC4 indicated that these dyes have good light harvesting ability. A correspondingly thinner nanocrystalline film was allowed so as to avoid the decrease in the film's mechanical strength. This also benefits the electrolyte diffusion in the film and reduces the recombination possibility of the light induced charges during transportation.14 As to the CT bands for these dyes, three points were noteworthy: (1) the introduction of the TT unit instead of the thiophene unit did not surely result in obvious red shifted absorption bands, such as in DDC4 compared to DDC2; (2) as expected, the benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole unit results in obvious red shifted bands, the reason for which were discussed in a previous report;10 (3) the dyes possessing electron withdrawing groups, i.e., DDC4 and DDC2 displayed slightly lower values of molar extinction coefficients of the CT band compared to the others, i.e., DDC1 and DDC3, a similar situation was reported before.10
The absorption spectra of DDC1–DDC4 and CBZ on thin transparent films (8 μm thick) after 12 h adsorption in THF solution are shown in Fig. 2(b) and the absorption data are listed in Table 1. It could be seen that in the 350–440 nm region, the absorption peaks for DDC1–DDC4 and CBZ on the TiO2 films are located at almost the same positions as that from the solution spectra. However, in the 440–700 nm region, the absorption peaks for DDC2–DDC4 and CBZ on the TiO2 films are located at 517, 458, 514 and 436 nm, correspondingly blue-shifted by 5, 6, 8 and 25 nm, respectively, from the solution, while the absorption peak for DDC1 is red-shifted by 14 nm. Such blue and red shifts have been reported in many other organic dyes on TiO2 electrodes.15
Electrochemical properties
Fig. S2† depicts the typical cyclic voltammogram of DDC1–DDC4 and CBZ, measured with five sensitizers attached to a 8 μm nanocrystalline TiO2 film deposited on conducting FTO glass in CH3CN containing 0.1 M TBAPF6 as the supporting electrolyte with a 0.1 V s−1 scan rate and the results are listed in Table 1. Each new donor containing dyes (DDC1–DDC4) displayed two major semi-reversible waves: the lower voltage one is ascribed to the oxidation of the donor, while the higher one could be ascribed to the oxidation of the oligothiophene and benzothiadiazole moieties (π spacer).16 The carbazole donor based dye (CBZ) presented only a wave which is derived from the oxidation of the carbazole moiety (donor). The HOMO level energies decreased slightly in the order of CBZ (1.45) > DDC2 (0.91) > DDC3 (0.86) > DDC4 (0.85) ≈ DDC1 (0.85) (the values are ones vs. NHE), thus the HOMO levels of these dyes were sufficiently lower than that of the electrolyte pair I−/I3− (ca. 0.40 V), which ensured a smooth electron flow from the electrolyte to the dyes. It is noteworthy that the HOMO levels of the new donor based dyes DDC1–DDC4 were much higher than that of CBZ based on the carbazole donor, suggesting that the donating ability of the new donor was much stronger than that of the carbazole donor. The LUMO levels were estimated by the values of Eox and the E0–0 band gaps, which were estimated at the intersection of absorption and emission spectra. A trend appeared as CBZ (−0.69) > DDC2 (−1.00) > DDC4 (−1.09) > DDC1 (−1.16) ≈ DDC3 (−1.16). All these levels were considerably higher than the conductive band level of TiO2 (ca. −0.5 V), indicating that the excited-state electrons injection of all five dyes are guaranteed to be efficient.
Computational analysis
To gain deep insight into the electronic distribution of the frontier and other close-lying orbitals as well as the geometrical configuration of these dyes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out. In the calculations, the long alkyl chains in these compounds were replaced by ethyl groups to save computational time while preserving their steric effect. The hybrid B3LYP functional17 and the Ahlrichs split valence SVP basis set18 was employed to optimize molecular geometries of the dyes and to compute their frontier molecular orbitals, using the ORCA program package.19 Subsequent time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations were performed to gain information of the lowest singlet excited states of the sensitizer dyes, using the Coulomb-attenuated CAM-B3LYP20 functional and the SVP basis set implemented in Gaussian 09 program package.
The charge distribution in the frontier molecular orbitals is depicted in Fig. S1.† As shown in the graphs, in the above four sensitizers, the HOMO level is localized mostly at the indolo[3,2-b]carbazole moiety (D), while the LUMO is localized mostly at oligothiophene units (π) and the anchoring cyanoacrylic acid (A) group. The electron distributions of both D and A are heavily coupled with the orbitals in the central bridge (π) and the desirable shift of electron density from D to A once upon photo excitation is obvious, suggesting that the electron transfer from the donor part to the acceptor units would be efficient once upon photoexcitation. The calculated oscillator strength (f) is shown in Table 1. The f values for the lowest energy transitions, the CT transitions, are all very high, ranging from 1.20 to 2.04. The results are roughly consistent with the absorptivity measured in solutions except for DDC2.
The geometrical configuration of these dyes is shown in Fig. 3. In the ground state, all these dyes are not totally planar. The dihedron angles between the indolo[3,2-b]carbazole moiety and the two phenyl rings connected to the central core of the donor were near to 90°, suggesting that these two phenyl rings may help to suppress dye aggregation when dyes are loaded on TiO2 films. For DDC1–DDC4, those possessing withdrawing group-benzothiadiazole units are obviously twisted more between the donor part and benzothiadiazole units compared to the others, i.e. such as DDC2 and DDC1, this phenomenon was reported by some previous articles.21

DSSCs performance
To investigate the light harvesting ability of DDC1–DDC4 and CBZ, DSSCs based on dye-sensitized TiO2 (12 μm) films and the electrolyte in the experimental section were fabricated and the performances were measured. Fig. 4(a) shows the action spectra of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for DSSCs with these dyes when CH3CN (AV)–DMF (v/v 3:1) was used as the solvent for dye loading. The IPCE exceeds 60% in the range 360–570 nm for DDC1, 390–430 and 510–540 nm for DDC2, 350–610 nm for DDC4 and 395–510 nm for CBZ, with the highest value of 74.8% at 470 nm for DDC1, 61.6% at 420 nm for DDC2, 77.2% at 430 nm for DDC4 and 66.0% at 440 nm for CBZ, respectively. However, the highest value of IPCE for DDC3 was only 58.9% at 410 nm. Among these five dyes, it could be easily seen that the IPCE for DDC3 displayed the poorest performance with low IPCE values and narrow IPCE spectra, while the IPCE for DDC4 exhibited the best performance with high IPCE values at a broad spectral region, indicating that a DDC4 sensitized TiO2 electrode would generate a higher conversion yield compared to the other four dyes. Except for DDC3, the IPCE performances of the dyes based on the new donor were all better than that of CBZ based on the carbazole donor. One explanation is that the molar extinction coefficients of the dyes based on the new donor were much higher than that of CBZ based on the carbazole donor. Generally, a high molar extinction coefficient means a good light harvesting ability, suggests that it would be helpful to convert light to electricity more efficiently,22 thus the high molar extinction coefficients would facilitate the new donor based dyes to display good IPCE performance.
 Fig. 4  The performances of DSSCs sensitized by DDC1–DDC4 and CBZ: (a) IPCE spectra for DSSCs based on DDC1–DDC4 and CBZ with dye baths in CH3CN (AV)–DMF (v/v 3:1) or CHCl3–EtOH (v/v 1:3); (b) I–V curves for DSSCs based on DDC1–DDC4 and CBZ with dye baths in AV–DMF (v/v 3:1) or CHCl3–EtOH (v/v 1:3) upon AM 1.5 solar light irradiation and I–V curves for DSSCs based on DDC1–DDC4 and CBZ with dye baths in AV–DMF (v/v 3:1) under dark condition. 
Note: (1) the order of the IPCE spectrum of the new four dyes based cells DDC4 > DDC1 > DDC2 > DDC3 was consistent with the order of the dye loading amount in practical devices (Table 1S†); (2) compared to the absorption spectra of sensitized films, the IPCE spectra were broadened significantly. This phenomenon could be ascribed to the scattering effect of the large particles in the film and the reflective effect of the Pt counter electrode. Moreover, the electrolyte could also pose influence on the IPCE values. Fig. 4(b) presents the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) plots of DSSCs based on these dyes, along with that of CBZ for comparison. The detailed parameters, i.e., short circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) measured under AM 1.5 solar light (100 mW cm−2) are summarized in Table 2. When the mixed solvents AV–DMF (v/v 3:1) were used as the solvents for dye baths, the DSSCs based on DDC1–DDC4 and CBZ exhibited inferior conversion efficiency of 6.09%, 5.55%, 4.11%, 6.40% and 4.90%. The larger Jsc of the DDC1 sensitized solar cell as compared with that of the solar cell based on CBZ demonstrates the beneficial influence of the high molar extinction coefficients of DDC1 in solution. The superior performance of the DDC1 sensitized solar cell presented an advantage of the new donor. The lower Jsc of the DDC2 sensitized solar cell as compared with that of DDC1 could be ascribed to the much lower IPCE values although DDC2 had a broad IPCE spectra. The DDC3 sensitized DSSCs performed very poorly with low Jsc and Voc. The low Jsc may be resulted from the low electron injection yield from LUMO levels into the TiO2 conduction band. The low Voc implied that there was severe charge recombination between the electrolytes and the electrons injected into TiO2. Among these five dyes, the DDC4 based DSSCs gave the best performance, with Jsc of 13.96 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.674 V, and a FF of 0.68, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 6.40%. The large Jsc could be attributed to the high IPCE values and the broad IPCE spectra. However, Voc of the DDC4 sensitized solar cell was not high and one possible reason is because of the existence of benzothiadiazole, which was reported many times previously.23 The low Voc of DDC2 was also consistent with this observation. Based on that the DDC1 and DDC4 sensitized solar cells displayed better performance among the five dyes, DSSCs based on the two dyes with dye loading in CHCl3–EtOH (v/v 1:3) were fabricated and the performances were measured. The reason why the mixed solvents CHCl3–EtOH (v/v 1:3) were chosen as the dye bath solvents was based on the consideration that many dyes based DSSCs fabricated with dye baths in these mixed solvents performed much better compared with other solvents.9b

As shown in Table 2, the photovoltaic performance for both DSSCs based on DDC1 and DDC4 was better when CHCl3–EtOH (v/v 1:3) were used as the solvents for dye loading compared with using AV–DMF (v/v 3:1) as the solvents for dye loading. The reason why the two dyes performed well in CHCl3–EtOH (v/v 1:3) was very complicated including that the diversified interactions among the dyes, solvents, electrolytes and semiconductor surface could alter the optical and chemical properties of dyes and semiconductor. Also, the solvent effect could pose an influence on the adsorbed amount of dyes on TiO2 films.24 It should be noted that DDC4 based DSSCs fabricated with dye baths of CHCl3–EtOH (v/v 1:3) exhibited a very good performance with η enhanced up to 7.03% with Jsc of 14.81 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.69 V and the FF of 0.69. The good performance of the DDC4 sensitized solar cell suggests that DDC4 is a promising candidate for application in DSSCs.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
To further clarify the dyes effect on the Voc in the DSSCs sensitized by these dyes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the DSSCs made with these sensitizers was performed. The Nyquist plots of the DSSCs based on the seven dyes under a forward bias of −0.70 V in the dark with a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz are shown in Fig. 5(a). The Bode phase was also shown in Fig. 5(b). Two semicircles were observed in the Nyquist plots. The smaller semicircle at high frequency is assigned to the redox charge-transfer response at the Pt/electrolyte interface. The large one at the intermediate frequency represents the electron-transfer impedance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. It is related to the charge recombination rate, generally, a smaller Rrec indicates a faster charge recombination and therefore a larger dark current (shown in Fig. 4(b)). The radius of the biggest semicircle Rrec values decreased in the order of DDC1 > DDC2 > CBZ > DDC3 ≈ DDC4. The result appears to be roughly consistent with the increase of Voc in the DSSCs based on DDC1–DDC4 and CBZ. In Bode phase plots, the peak position of the middle frequency is related to the electron lifetime and a shift to low frequency corresponds to a longer electron life-time. Thus, according to the Fig. 5(b), the order of the corresponding electron lifetimes DDC1 > DDC2 ≈ CBZ > DDC4 > DDC3 further approximately supports the order of the Voc of DSSCs based on these dyes.

Stability of the sensitizers
The stability of dyes is an essentially important factor considering the practical application in DSSCs, because the stability of dyes will greatly influence the lifetime of the corresponding DSSCs. To evaluate the photo-stability of these dyes, the methodology by Katoh and coworkers was employed.6 Sensitizers adsorbed on 8 μm TiO2 films without redox electrolyte were successively irradiated upon AM 1.5 solar light for 30 min. Fig. 6 shows the absorption curves of dyes DDC1–DDC4 and CBZ upon light irradiation of AM 1.5 solar light (30 min). Obviously, sensitizers based on the new donor are stable enough without any distinct absorption peak shift and the variations of absorbance in the CT bands before and after irradiation are very small. Nevertheless, the maximum absorbance variations in CT bands for benzothiadiazole-incorporated DDC2 and DDC4 before and after irradiation is smaller than that for oligothiophene-containing DDC1 and DDC3, suggesting that the benzothiadiazole-containing DDC2 and DDC4 are more stable than DDC1 and DDC3. This phenomenon is consistent with a similar situation reported before.10 What's more, from the comparison of DDC1 and DDC3, it could be observed that the introduction of TT instead of thiophene could increase the photo-stability of the corresponding dyes. The comparison of DDC2 and DDC4 showed the same phenomenon. Finally, incorporating the benzothiadiazole unit and TT unit as π-spacer, both of which are helpful to stabilize the oxidized dyes upon light irradiation, DDC4 displayed the best photo-stability with very small absorption variations in the CT band. It is noteworthy that the percentage of the maximum absorbance variations in CT bands for CBZ based on the carbazole donor is much larger than that for the new donor based DDC1 which has a similar structure (9.0% for CBZ, 4.1% for DDC1), indicating that the new donors are much more capable of stabilizing oxidized states of dyes than the carbazole donor. The good photo-stability of dyes DDC2–DDC4 further supports this viewpoint.
 Fig. 6  Absorption curves of dyes DDC1–DDC4 and CBZ on 8 μm TiO2 films upon light irradiation of AM 1.5 solar light (30 min) at ambient temperature; ΔAmax: the maximum absorbance variations in CT bands before and after irradiation (30 min); A: the maximum absorbance in CT bands before irradiation; ΔAmax/A: the percentage of the maximum absorbance variations in CT bands upon light irradiation (30 min). 
To investigate the temperature effects on the physics of the dyes, absorption curves of dyes on TiO2 films which were kept for 30 min at different temperatures (25 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C and 60 °C) were measured. As shown in Fig. 4S,† dyes on TiO2 films at these four temperatures were fairly thermo-stable with the percentage of the maximum absorbance variations in CT bands of no more than 1.5% before and after heating.
Conclusions
In summary, four dyes (DDC1–DDC4) based on the new donors with two fused carbazole units, containing benzothiadiazole (or thiophene) and TT (or thiophene) as π-spacer, 2-cyanoacetic acid as acceptor, were successfully synthesized and demonstrated as efficient sensitizers for DSSCs. The results showed that the synthesis and purification of this new donor with two fused carbazole units were simple. The large and effective conjugation of the new donor contributed to a high molar extinction coefficient of the corresponding dyes which is in favour of the dyes harvesting more photoelectrons. The comparison between DDC1 and CBZ, from the Jsc or from the Voc, both suggested that the donor has some advantages over the carbazole donor for the corresponding DSSCs. Derived from the broad absorption spectrum and efficient electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2, DDC4 with the large Jsc, exhibited the best performance among these dyes with an overall efficiency of 7.03% (Jsc of 14.81 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.69 V and FF of 0.69). As to the photo-stability of these dyes, the new donor facilitated the corresponding dyes to stabilize the oxidized state once upon the light irradiation. As for the π-spacer, the introduction of the benzothiadiazole unit was once again proved to increase the photo-stability of the corresponding dyes in this system. Most importantly, the influence of the introduction of the TT unit in the π-spacer on the photo-stability of the corresponding dyes has firstly been examined and in this system, the introduction of TT could strikingly reinforce the photo-stability of the corresponding dyes.
Experimental section
Materials and reagents
Optically transparent FTO conducting glass (F-doped SnO, transmission >90% in the visible, sheet resistance 15 Ω per square, Geao Science and Educational Co. Ltd. of China) was washed with detergent, redistilled water, ethanol, chloroform and acetone successively under supersonication for 30 min each before use. Titania pastes of Ti-Nanoxide T/SP and Ti-Nanoxide 300 were obtained from Geao Science and Educational Co. Ltd. of China. Reagent grade LiI, I2 (purity > 99.999%), TiCl4, acetonitrile (AV), 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), chloroform, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), ethanol (C2H5OH), 2.4 M BuLi solution in hexane and the reaction catalyst Pd(PPh3)4 were used as received without further purification from commercial sources. Acetonitrile with HPLC purity was purchased from SK Chemicals. THF was pre-dried over sodium and distilled under argon atmosphere from sodium benzophenone ketyl immediately prior to use. All other chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Instruments and characterization
The new compounds were characterized by 1H NMR (400 MHz), 13C NMR (100 MHz) and mass spectrometry. NMR spectra were obtained on a Brucker AM 400 spectrometer and mass spectra were recorded on an ESI mass spectrometer. Elemental analyses were measured by German elementar vario EL III. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the dyes solutions and dye-loaded films were measured with a Varian Cary 500 spectrophotometer. The cyclic voltammograms of dyes were obtained from a Versastat II electrochemical workstation (Princeton applied research). The conventional three electrode configuration was employed with a dye-loaded film as the working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and a regular calomel reference electrode in saturated KCl solution. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M TBAPF6 in AV. The scan rate was 100 mV s−1. The potential of the reference electrode was calibrated by ferrocene and all the potential data in this paper are relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of all the DSSCs were carried out under dark using a Zahner IM6e Impedance Analyzer (ZAHNER-Elektrik GmbH & CoKG, Kronach, Germany). The spectra were scanned in a frequency range of 0.1 × 105 Hz with an applied potential set at the open circuit of the corresponding DSSCs. The alternate current amplitude was set at 10 mV.
Measurements
Photovoltaic measurements were performed with a AM 1.5 solar simulator A 300 W xenon lamp (Model no. 91160, Oriel) as the light source. The work curves of the cell were obtained under the following conditions: (1) the power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by a reference Si solar cell; (2) cell active area was tested with a mask of 0.25 cm−2 used to cover around the cell active area. The photocurrent action spectra were obtained through an IPCE test system with a model SR830 DSP Lock. A 7IL/PX150 xenon lamp was used as the light source and the IPCE spectra were recorded on a 7ISW301 spectrometer.
Fabrication of DSSCs
To a well-cleaned FTO conducting glass, thin TiO2 films (12 μm) consisting of a transparent layer (Ti-Nanoxide T/SP) and a 4 μm scattering layer (Ti-Nanoxide 300) were coated using a screen printing technique,18 followed by calcinated at 500 °C under an air flow in a muffle for 30 min. After cooling down to the ambient temperature, the obtained films were immersed in 0.05 M aqueous TiCl4 solution for 30 min at 75 °C, then washed with redistilled water and anhydrous ethanol consecutively, followed by annealing at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling down, the obtained films were immersed into the dye solution (0.1 M in the required solvents) for 12 h. After dye loading on the films, the working electrodes were rinsed with chloroform and anhydrous ethanol respectively. The Pt-counter electrodes were made by depositing ∼100 nm thick Pt on the conductive surface and two holes (0.8 mm diameter) were drilled by a drill-press. The working and Pt-counter electrodes were assemble into a sandwich type solar cell and sealed with a hot-melt gasket of 25 μm thickness. The electrolyte was injected into the cell from the holes and the fabrication of the solar cells was finally finished by sealing the holes using a UV-melt gum. The electrolytes was composed of 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-TBP) in acetonitrile (AV) as a liquid electrolyte.
