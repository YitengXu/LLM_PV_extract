    , Accepted 18th November 2019First published on 21st November 2019AbstractThe serious threat of global warming has made it necessary to seek alternative sources of energy. In fact, the search for cheap and clean energy is the subject of several research investigations nowadays. Conjugated materials are essential ingredients for modern optoelectronics. Thus the development of new π-conjugated materials has gained significant attention. In particular, pyrazine-based materials are receiving a considerable amount of interest owing to their favorable charge transfer properties and their physical properties. This review mainly focuses on recent research progress in pyrazine derivatives, summarizes the brief synthetic routes and highlights their application in various fields, such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes and field effect-transistors and provides motivation towards their further exploration. The eventual low-cost and potential large-scale production of these optoelectronic devices will represent a great accomplishment of materials science.
1. Introduction
Organic molecules with a π-conjugated system represent attractive targets for application in advanced functional materials. The use of organic compounds as active materials in electronic and optoelectronic devices opens the door to a large number of efficient and potentially low-cost methods for fabricating useful structures. The technological promises of these materials include their low cost, easy fabrication, tunable material properties, light weight and compatibility with flexible substrates and low temperature high-throughput manufacturing processes. Over the last decade, the performance of optoelectronic devices has rapidly advanced in terms of efficiency and lifetime, especially those of organic solar cells (OSCs),1–4 organic field effect transistors (OFETs),5–7 organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs),8–10 sensors,11–14 nonlinear optics15 and many others. A key to the design of high performance optical and electronic organic devices is the understanding of the electronic structures of materials.16,17 Subtle changes in the structures of organic materials can alter their bulk properties. Thus their structure–property relationships can be used to understand the properties of existing devices.
Among many types of chromophores developed, push–pull chomophores,18–21 which consist of alternating electron-rich and electron-deficient units, have been extensively studied because their intrinsic optical and electronic properties can be readily tuned in a desired way by controlling the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor to acceptor units.22 The electron-donating moieties are normally composed of thiophene, acridine, phenoxazine, phenazine, and aryl amines such as diphenylamine, triphenylamine and carbazole, due to their excellent photoconductivity, while electron-accepting moieties often consist of benzonitrile, pyridine, benzoic acid, trifluoromethyl benzene, triazole, triazine, etc. Among many heterocyclic compounds, the pyrazine ring is predominantly employed as a π-linker in dipolar chromophores.23–26 Indeed, this heterocycle is a versatile fragment that is capable of acting as a powerful electron-withdrawing group and is extensively used as part of push–pull systems. The introduction of pyrazine into π-extended systems is a way of modifying and enhancing the useful properties where electron transport is necessary. Pyrazine with its highly electron deficient aromatic character is a good candidate for being incorporated as the electron withdrawing part in push–pull scaffolds favoring the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). As the backbone, the pyrazine core can induce luminescent properties. The capability of protonation, hydrogen bond formation and chelation of the nitrogen atom of pyrazine is of significant importance, and as pyrazine-based chromophores are highly sensitive to acid and base, such derivatives could be used in sensors. Therefore pyrazine is an important building block to construct symmetric and asymmetric dipolar systems. This review is dedicated to pyrazine-fused small molecules such as quinoxaline, dibenzophenazine, dithienophenazine, pyridopyrazine, thienopyrazine, dithienoquinoxaline and large π-conjugated pyrazine derivatives which are included in our discussion; it does not cover polymers. The present review focuses on the progress and development of pyrazine based building blocks in different domains like solar cell, OLED, and OFET materials.
2. Synthesis of pyrazine derivatives
Pyrazine derivatives suitable for optoelectronic applications can be designed by integrating donors, acceptors or both. The pyrazine core can act as both an acceptor and a spacer. Two general strategies are described in the literature for the synthesis of pyrazine derivatives: (1) construction of pyrazine rings by condensation reaction of α-diketones with diamines27 but this is suitable for the preparation of unsymmetrical substituted pyrazines (Fig. 1); and (2) functionalization of the pyrazine ring by nucleophilic substitution and cross-coupling reactions.28–31 Large varieties of halogeno, amino and methyl derivatives are commercially available which can be used as building blocks to construct π-conjugated materials. Cross-coupling reactions involving halogenated pyrazine substituents constitute an excellent synthetic pathway for the construction of π-conjugated structures. The electron deficient character of the pyrazine ring makes the oxidative addition of palladium to a carbon–chloride (C–Cl) bond easier without the use of expensive ligands.32 Therefore, a wide range of coupling reactions like Sonogashira,33 Suzuki,34 Negishi,35 and Heck reactions36 have been carried out with halogenated pyrazine or quinoxaline building blocks.

3. Applications
3.1 Active materials for dye sensitized solar cells
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have emerged as important sources of renewable energy and have the potential to replace inorganic silicon solar cells. Therefore, DSSCs should be competitive because of their low cost of production, simple device fabrication, and flexibility in molecular design and the wide availability of organic dyes. Prototype DSSCs have a donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) structure; the donor, acceptor and conjugate spacer can all be tuned to maximize the ICT. Fig. 2 shows a generalized donor–π bridge–acceptor structure. With tunable absorption properties and energy levels, pyrazines can be employed as metal-free organic sensitizers in DSSCs as acceptors or π-linkers. The improvements and challenges that arise in dye-sensitized solar cells have been reviewed by many authors.37–39 Many efforts have been made towards changing the different parts of organic dyes to optimize the performance of DSSCs. To date, hundreds of organic dyes including indoline dyes,40–42 triarylamine dyes,43 coumarin dyes,44–46 carbazole dyes,47–50 perylene dyes,51 and natural dyes52 have been adopted to act as sensitizers for DSSCs and have demonstrated impressive efficiencies. In this review, we define pyrazine and pyrazine-fused rigid aromatic rings that are capable of forming a quinoidal structure.

3.1.1 Pyrazine and quinoxaline dyes. 
Pyrazine-based metal free organic sensitizers were synthesized and used for dye-sensitized solar cells, due to their convenient modulation of ICT. Taking advantage of their strong light-absorption and high stability, Ooyama and co-workers reported D–A based fluorescent dyes 1 and 2 with pyrazine as an anchoring group (Fig. 3).53 There is a formation of a pyrazinium ion between the pyrazyl group of the dyes and a TiO2 surface. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPEC) of 2 is higher than that of 1; the broad and intense spectral features of 2 lead to its high IPEC and JSC values. Park et al. reported quinoxaline-based organic sensitizers using vertical (3) and horizontal (4) conjugation between electron-donating triphenylamine and electron-acceptor quinoxaline.54 The different configurations of 3 and 4 significantly affect their electronic and photovoltaic properties. The internal IPCE is higher in the latter, due to the lower chance of recombination due to the bulkier structure of 3 compared to 4. Thus organic dye 4 (5.56%) showed higher efficiency than 3 (3.30%). The efficiencies of the dyes can be improved by controlling their molecular structure by connecting the donor to the acceptor in a horizontal direction.

Li and co-workers introduced metal-free sensitizers containing 11,12-bis(hexyloxy)dibenzo[a,c]phenazine (BPz)55 between the triphenylamine donor and the 2-cyanoacrylic acid acceptor to construct organic sensitizers 5–7. These dyes belong to D–π–A′–π–A sensitizers with BPz as the auxiliary acceptor.56BPz causes an anti-aggregation effect that suppresses charge recombination. As shown in Fig. 4, the absorption spectra of the sensitizers become broadened with an extended absorption onset above 720 nm, which favors light harvesting in solar cells. The behavior of the sensitizers with co-adsorbent chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was investigated. The amount of sensitizer adsorbed on the TiO2 surface was reduced by the co-adsorbent. Therefore, high-performance DSSCs can be achieved without co-adsorbent. Among these sensitizers, 7 showed the best overall conversion efficiency of 7.18% (JSC = 14.40 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.74 V, FF = 0.67) under standard AM 1.5G conditions. Solar cells based on 5 and 6 show lower efficiencies of 5.23% and 6.41% (Fig. 4d). All sensitizers have similar chemical structures, but different photovoltaic performances. The results show that auxiliary acceptors and bulky fused aromatic rings improve the performance of DSSCs.

Zhou et al. constructed a near-infrared organic dye, 10, with a strong electron-withdrawing group, dithieno[2,3-a:3′,2′-c]phenazine,57 by fusing thiophene rings on the quinoxaline unit in sensitizer 9, in order to expand the absorption band of the dye. The repulsive force between the two thiophene rings linked at the 2,3-position of the pyrazine ring weakened the effective conjugation and ICT in 9 as shown in Fig. 5a. As the molecular twist is minimized in 10, the absorption spectrum of 10 covers the whole visible region and extends to the NIR region and exhibits two distinct absorption bands. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves measured at 100 mW cm−2 is shown in Fig. 5c and photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table 1. Sensitizer 10 exhibited relatively poor DSSC performance, due to its low photogenerated current induced by weak driving force for electron injection. After optimizing the molar ratio between 10 and 8, the co-sensitized cocktail-type quasi-solid-state DSSCs showed a higher efficiency of 8.04% with good long term stability after continuous light soaking for 1000 h, as compared to that sensitized with either 10 (5.28%) or 8 (7.03%). The results are attributed to the complementary absorption profiles of the two sensitizers, which also suppress the intramolecular interactions among the dye molecules. Zhou and co-workers58 also reported fluorinated sensitizers 12 and 13 containing a 6,7-difluoroquinoxaline unit and compared them with sensitizer 11 to study the effect of the introduction of fluorine on the photovoltaic properties. The electron withdrawing ability is strengthened upon incorporation of fluorine into the quinoxaline unit, the introduction of fluorine narrows the band gap energy. Compared to sensitizers 11 (6.0%) and 12 (6.8%), sensitizer 13 displays the highest power conversion efficiency (8.2%), which illustrated good stability after continuous sunlight soaking for 1000 h, due to the enhanced push–pull interactions.

To investigate the relationship between the chemical structure of the auxiliary acceptor and photovoltaic properties, Zhou and co-workers reported a series of organic dyes 14–17 with different numbers of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) bridge and acceptor units for quasi-solid-state DSSCs (Fig. 6).59 As shown in Fig. 7 the quasi-solid-state DSSC based on 14 displayed a JSC of 13.97 mA cm−2. Upon incorporation of an additional EDOT unit, sensitizer 16 provided a JSC of 17.59 mA cm−2. Both sensitizers 16 and 17 with a D–π–A′–π–A configuration exhibited broader absorption spectra, which enhance their light harvesting capability. Compared to cyanoacrylic acid, rhodanine-3-acetic acid strengthens ICT interactions and bathochromically shifts absorption maxima, but the methylene group in the latter interrupts the LUMO levels on the anchoring group. Consequently, sensitizer 16 displayed the highest power conversion efficiency of 8.2%, which exhibits good long term stability.

Pei and co-workers developed novel D–A–π–A featured quinoxaline dye 19 in conjugation with 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) and an indoline unit as an electron donor for enhancement in photovoltaic efficiency.60 Compared to reference dye 18 (9.2%), dye 19 showed a slightly lower efficiency of 9.03%; this arises from the decrease of VOC, which offsets the gain in JSC. Theoretical analysis shows that the molecular sizes of 19 and cosensitizer S2 match very well (Fig. 8a). Also the IPCE value based on cosensitization was slightly higher than that based on only 19 as shown in Fig. 8c. Thus the cocktail of dye 19 with a coadsorbent exhibited an efficiency of 10.41% under AM 1.5G illumination (JSC = 19.8 mA cm−2, VOC = 731 mV, FF = 0.72). The sensitizers effectively suppress charge recombination and enhance the light harvesting ability in the lower wavelength region. The improved efficiency is attributed to the well-matched molecular structure and the loading amount of both dyes. So to improve the light-harvesting capability of quinoxaline dyes and to examine the donor influence on the performance of dyes 20–22, theoretical analysis was conducted by Li and co-workers.61 Compared to the parent dye 18, N-annulated perylene bearing dye 22 shows better performance despite possessing a smaller dipole moment not only prevents unfavorable self-aggregation but also inhibits back recombination.

Recently, Lin et al. developed a series of D–A′–π–A type sensitizers 23–26 incorporating thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (TP) and benzo[3,4-b]pyrazine (BP) as auxiliary groups with two bis(alkoxy)phenyl substituents for DSSC application in order to achieve panchromatic absorption in the visible region (Fig. 9a).62 The dyes with the BP core (25: 7.88%; 26: 8.22%) have higher efficiencies than TP-based dyes (23: 3.92%; 24: 5.08%) as observed from the current density curves and IPCE plots in Fig. 9. The lower VOC value can be attributed to less efficient dark current suppression and lower JSC values due to less efficient electron injection. Also the electron recombination lifetime extracted from Bode phase plots provides additional evidence. The larger Rrec values of the BP than TP dyes may be due to their more compact packing. Dye 26 has IPCE values above 80% in the range of 400–620 nm and exhibits the best efficiency of 8.21% under 1 sun illumination (JSC = 17.12 mA cm−2, VOC = 719 mV, FF = 0.67) due to its higher dye loading and with CDCA co-adsorbent achieved an efficiency of 9.03% due to the lower degree of dye aggregation.

To overcome the narrow absorption spectrum and to harvest sunlight over a broad spectral range, Zhou and co-workers developed quinoxaline-based sensitizers 27–30 and compared them with the thienopyrazine unit (55).63 The alkyl substituents are removed from the spacer part in 27 and from the donor part in 28 and 29. This results in a more conjugated system, which enhances light harvesting efficiency and photogenerated current due to their bathochromically shifted absorption spectra. The device based on sensitizer 29 with liquid electrolyte exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency of 8.27% (JSC = 16.16 mA cm−2, VOC = 682 mV, FF = 0.75) and efficiency of 7.14% for quasi-solid-state DSSCs, after continuous light soaking for 1000 h. Thus molecular engineering plays a crucial role in designing efficient organic dyes.
The excited-state oxidation potential E(s+s*) can be conveniently tuned by increasing the conjugation of the nitrogen atom containing heterocycles for use in liquid electrolyte DSSC devices.64 Delcamp and co-workers reported a series of sensitizers that included quinoxaline 31 and pyrazine 32. Pyrazine acceptors provide a dipole for photon-induced charge separation and a better driving force for injection than cyanoacrylate. The DSSC device based on 32 shows a higher efficiency of 6.55% (JSC = 11.5 mA cm−2, VOC = 743 mV, and FF = 0.76) without any co-adsorbent, as compared to that of 31 (5.20%), due to its poor dye loading caused by the steric hindrance in the latter.


3.1.2 Dithienophenazine dyes. 
The structure–property relationships of quadrupolar D2A sensitizers were explored by Reynolds and co-workers. They developed a series of sensitizers 33–36 based on dibenzophenazine (DBP) or dithienophenazine (DTP) to investigate the influence of the nature of the acceptor (Fig. 10). Regioisomers are prepared depending on their connecting position to the core.65 This induces noticeable changes in their optoelectronic properties. The DBP series have a VOC of ∼80 mV greater than the DTP series. This increase in VOC can be attributed to the shift of the TiO2 conduction band. DSSCs based on these D2A sensitizers showed efficiencies in the range 0.58–0.75% without use of additives or scattering TiO2 layers. Both the isomers displayed different optoelectronic properties. Branched dyes showed higher overlapping of the orbital density and smaller injection barriers. Thus fine-tuning of sensitizers is vital for understanding their fundamental properties (Table 2).

Reynolds and co-workers also reported sensitizers 37–42 containing dithienophenazine as the spacer and thiophene as the electron donor for DSSC application to improve the efficiencies of dithienophenazine dyes.66 Dithieno[2,3-a:3′,2′-c]phenazine and dithieno[3,2-a:2′3′-c]phenazine isomers were employed as acceptor units coupled with thiophene to construct dyes. The authors demonstrated that the isomerism of the dyes affects their physical properties, as linear isomers present a more rigid structure than the branched isomers. The optical absorptions were red shifted by adding thiophene units. The results show that the lengthening of the internal donor chain from two to six increases the efficiency.


3.1.3 Pyridopyrazine dyes. 
Over the past decade, pyridopyrazine derivatives have become a popular segment for developing metal-free sensitizers for DSSCs. Li et al. explored push–pull type sensitizers using pyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine as a new π-linker. Two new sensitizers 43 and 44 with different cores of bulky donors, indoline and triphenylamine, were synthesized for comparative study (Fig. 11).67 Both sensitizers have similar values in the dihedral angles (Fig. 12a). Therefore, replacement of indoline with triphenylamine does not influence the planarity of the whole molecule. Thus absorption spectra of the two sensitizers are almost similar. As shown in Fig. 12 the broader wavelength range of IPCE and higher IPCE values suggest that 43 should have higher JSC than 44 (Table 3). Therefore, dye 43 displays a higher efficiency of 8.57% (JSC = 16.08 mA cm−2, VOC = 802 mV, and FF = 0.66) under standard AM 1.5G sunlight, as compared with 44 (7.74%) due to the inhibition of charge recombination and dye aggregation by the N-phenylindoline core, which acts as an insulating blocking group. Also the longer electron lifetime of 43 contributes to higher VOC and the HOMO level of 43 is less positive than that of 44 due to the stronger electron donating ability of indoline. Thus indoline-based dyes exhibit better performance than their triphenylamine-based analogues.

Grätzel and co-workers scrutinized dyes with different linkers and reported a series of pyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine based sensitizers 45–49 containing different donors and π-spacers and employed them in DSSCs.68 The device based on 49 exhibited the highest efficiency of 7.12% (JSC = 13.56 mA cm−2, VOC = 691 mV, and FF = 0.76) with liquid electrolyte and 6.20% with ionic-liquid electrolyte. The results show that the methoxyphenyl substitution can improve the cells’ JSC and VOC; also the introduction of octyloxydiphenylamine improved the efficiency of sensitizer 49. The octyloxy group significantly extends the π-conjugation of the donor, which reduces the band gap in the dyes. This helps in increasing the electron lifetime and charge recombination resistance.
Hua and co-workers constructed organic sensitizer 50 with powerful electron-donating indeno[1,2-b]thiophene functionalized with triphenylamine as the strong donor and 2,3-diphenylpyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine as the auxiliary acceptor to gain NIR absorption for application in DSSCs.69 The device based on sensitizer 50 achieved efficiencies of 7.23% (JSC = 16.73 mA cm−2, VOC = 667 mV, and FF = 0.65) with cobalt electrolytes and 6.29% (JSC = 14.19 mA cm−2, VOC = 647 mV, and FF = 0.69) with iodine electrolytes under standard AM 1.5G sunlight. Its higher VOC is attributed to its longer lifetime and suppressed charge recombination. The higher efficiency with cobalt electrolytes may be due to o,p-dialkoxyphenyl in the donor. In continuation of this, Hua and co-workers reported two novel organic blue-colored photosensitizers 51 and 52 based on 2,3-diphenylpyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine (PP) and 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline (QT) as auxiliary acceptors in conjugation with cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) as a π-linker for solid state DSSCs.70 Sensitizer 52 containing QT as an electron withdrawing group exhibits a remarkably higher molar extinction coefficient of 6.30 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and broad absorption spectrum (600 nm) compared to 51 as shown in Fig. 13a. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves of the solar cells based on the sensitizers are shown in Fig. 13. The device based on 52 displayed a higher efficiency of 7.81% (JSC = 12.91 mA cm−2, VOC = 810 mV, and FF = 0.73) compared to 51 (4.71%) under one sun light. This opens up co-sensitization strategies in combination with traditional yellow-red colored organic dyes and encourages developing blue colored dyes with high molar extinction coefficients.

Hua et al. also reported conjugated D–A–π–A sensitizers 53 and 54 containing indoline unit as a donor and 4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silol[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTS) as a π-linker and modified pyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine as an auxiliary acceptor for solid state DSSCs.71 Replacing CPDT with DTS effectively reduces dye aggregation and prevents charge recombination due to the presence of two out-of-plane 2-ethylhexyl groups. The dye deprotonation and aggregation on TiO2 films result in broadening of the absorption spectra as displayed in Fig. 14. The photocurrent density–voltage curves and IPCE spectra show that dye 53 exhibits better photovoltaic performance with power conversion efficiencies up to 10.0% (JSC = 19.54 mA cm−2, VOC = 738 mV, and FF = 0.69) compared to 54 (η = 8.43%, JSC = 18.89 mA cm−2, VOC = 694 mV, and FF = 0.64) in a standard liquid electrolyte.

3.1.4 Thienopyrazine and dithienoquinoxaline dyes. 
In order to expand the absorption band of the dyes, Zhou and co-workers constructed three NIR sensitizers 55–57 based on thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (TPz) for efficient quasi-solid state DSSCs.72 Compared with dye 55, acenaphtho[1,2-b]thieno[3,4-e]pyrazine dyes 56 and 57 exhibit a bathochromic shift of the absorption spectra and cover the whole visible range extending into the NIR region up to 900 nm (Fig. 15). Such a broad absorption is beneficial to the improvement of photocurrent density and efficiency. However, 56 and 57 exhibit low VOC values, which partially counteract the positive effect of the NIR IPCE response, resulting in moderate efficiencies of 5.3 and 4.93%, respectively (Table 4). Nevertheless, the cell of 56 exhibited good long-term stability with constant power conversion efficiency under one sun soaking for 1000 h, which makes it a promising candidate for practical application. In continuation of this, Zhou and co-workers reported four types of organic sensitizers with D–A–π–A (58 and 59) and D–π–A–π–A (60 and 61) with cyanoacrylic acid and carboxylic acid as anchoring groups.73 Incorporation of an additional phenyl ring into 60 and 61 results in hypochromic shift of their absorption spectra. This ensures sufficient driving force for charge injection and dye regeneration. Thus the efficiency of the quasi-solid-state DSSC based on 60 (7.2%) increased by 95% in comparison with dye 55.

To study the structure–property relationship, Delcamp and co-workers reported a series of tunable thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine bridged dual donor, dual acceptor (DD–π–AA) sensitizers 62–68 demonstrating absorption into the NIR region for DSSCs.74,75 Triphenylamine based dyes exhibited suitable energy levels for making DSC devices. Sensitizer 64 and 66 based devices displayed moderate efficiencies of 5.0 and 5.1%, respectively. Dye 66 exhibited better efficiency in a single dye device as the photovoltage increased due to reduced recombination loss. Dye 64 exhibited the highest efficiency of 7.5% (JSC = 17.6 mA cm−2, VOC = 612 mV, and FF = 0.67) with the introduction of a cosensitizer as this lowers the TiO2 conduction band for efficient electron injection and reduces dye aggregation.
In a different approach, Lin and co-workers developed a new series of dipolar sensitizers 69–73 containing arylamine as a donor, dithieno[3,2-f:2′,3′-h]quinoxaline (DTQ) as an internal acceptor, and 2-cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor.76 The electron-deficient DTQ unit is advantageous for the red-shift of the absorption spectrum (Fig. 16). DSSCs based on these dyes showed power conversion efficiencies in the range from 6.11 to 7.59%. Moreover, when dye 72 was co-adsorbed with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), the cell efficiency reached an efficiency of 8.41% (JSC = 15.48 mA cm−2, VOC = 754 mV, and FF = 0.72), which is higher than that of an N719-based standard cell under AM 1.5G irradiation.
 Fig. 16  Dithienoquinoxaline based dyes 69–81. 
Cao and co-workers constructed novel sensitizers 74–78 featuring dipentyldithieno[3,2-f:2′,3′-h]quinoxaline (DPQ) unit as a π-spacer and applied them in DSSCs.77 The inserted electron-rich unit 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene or electron-withdrawing group benzothiadiazole (BTD) exhibits broad photospectral response. Also, the different electron donors significantly affect the performance of the DSSCs. Dye 78 with indoline as a donor and BTD as an additional π-bridge yields the highest conversion efficiency of 7.12% (JSC = 17.61 mA cm−2, VOC = 685 mV, and FF = 0.59) under standard global AM 1.5G solar light illumination. The incorporation of BTD results in better electron transition properties, narrows the HOMO–LUMO energy gap, and suppresses electron recombination.
To study the impact of the auxiliary acceptor on the photovoltaic performance and to improve the performance of DPQ-based dyes, Cao et al. reported three novel dyes 79–81 in which the auxiliary acceptor BDT was changed to quinoxaline or pyridopyrazine.78 Sensitizer 80 with 2,3-dipentylquinoxaline exhibited the highest efficiency of 7.98% (JSC = 16.87 mA cm−2, VOC = 710 mV, and FF = 0.67) under standard global AM 1.5G solar light illumination. Meanwhile, dye 81 showed the weakest performance due to the electron trap of pyridopyrazine, which restrains the electron transfer process. The results show that incorporating an auxiliary acceptor with a moderately electron deficient unit adjusts molecular orbital energy levels, improving the photovoltaic performance.


3.1.5 Other organic dyes. 
Recently, we reported dihydrodipyrrolopyrazine based sensitizers 82–85 end-capped with different donor (thiophene) and acceptor (pyridine, –COOH, –CN) units.79 Pyrrolopyrazine was found to be useful as the motif for the sensitizers because its coplanarity benefits π-conjugation. DSSCs based on these dyes showed efficiencies in the range of 0.05% to 1.44% without the use of additives (Fig. 17). Yang et al. developed two novel organic sensitizers 86 and 87 containing pyrazino-[2,3-f][1,10]phenanthroline (PPL) as an electron-withdrawing anchoring group.80 Dyes 86 and 87 were efficiently adsorbed on the TiO2 surface through the anchoring group. The solar cell based on dye 87 showed the highest power conversion efficiency of 4.04% (JSC = 8.08 mA cm−2, VOC = 694 mV, and FF = 0.72) under standard global AM 1.5G conditions, indicating that PPL is a promising building block with dual functions, acceptor and anchor, for carboxylic acid free organic dyes (Table 5).

Hiroshi Imahori and co-workers constructed novel quinoxaline-fused porphyrin-based photosensitizers 88–90 for DSSCs and examined the effect of the π-elongation and the fused position of quinoxaline on their photovoltaic properties.81 The devices based on the three molecules have power conversion efficiencies of 5.1% (88), 0.8% (89) and 6.3% (90), respectively. The 89-based cell exhibited low efficiency, due to its short fluorescence lifetime and charge recombination. The weak electronic coupling between the LUMO and the conduction band in dye 88 resulted in low incident photon-to-current efficiency. Later Gust et al. reported sensitizer 91 based on pyrazine rings linked to porphyrin chromophores on a metal oxide surface.82 The DSSC sensitized with dye 91 shows 3.5 times higher efficiency (2.0%) than a similar sensitizer with a single porphyrin model compound, due to the reduced charge recombination between TiO2 and the sensitizer.

3.2 Emitting materials for OLEDs
Since their discovery in 1987, OLEDs have rapidly become one of the hottest research topics in the light emission field, due to their promising applications in new-generation flat-panel displays and energy-saving solid lighting sources. Full color displays require all three primary colors: red, green, and blue (RGB). To improve the efficiency of OLEDs, it is of great importance to improve their external quantum efficiency and to decrease their operating voltage. Improving the design of functional materials, especially electron transport materials, plays a vital role in reaching these targets. Most of the OLEDs focus on developing organic materials and engineering the device structure to achieve high-performance OLEDs. Several reviews dedicated to blue, green, red and near-infrared (NIR) OLEDs have been published.10,83–85 Emitters still suffer from inferior electroluminescence performances in terms of efficiency, lifespan, color quality, and charge injection/transport. Numerous pyrazine-based emitting materials have been developed for efficient OLEDs, and they are described in different categories and discussed in this section.
Spin statistics suggest that phosphorescent OLEDs and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) could achieve an internal quantum efficiency of 100% compared to fluorescent OLEDs, which can achieve up to 25% (Fig. 18). By harvesting singlet and triplet excitons through intersystem crossing, 100% internal quantum efficiency can be achieved. Fig. 19 shows a typical device configuration of OLEDs. Upon applying a voltage, the electrons are injected from the cathode and transported in the electron transporting layer (ETL), and at the same time, the holes are injected from the transparent anode and transported in the hole-transporting layer (HTL). The electrons and holes finally recombine in the emitting layer (EMI) to form excitons, and the radiative decay of excitons produces electroluminescence. The emitting materials in the EML play a key role in affecting the emitting color, brightness, EL efficiency and lifetime of OLEDs.

3.2.1 Deep-blue fluorescent emitters. 
Efficient blue emitting materials are essential for the commercialization of white OLEDs and smart display devices. Pyrazine-based materials have attracted tremendous interest in producing efficient deep-blue OLEDs (Fig. 20). Park et al. designed and synthesized an indenopyrazine-based fluorophore with deep-blue emission.86 By using a suitable device structure, OLEDs were fabricated based on 92–95 as non-doped emissive layers, and were found to exhibit high luminance efficiencies of 2.01–4.3 cd A−1 at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Fluorophore 94 was found to exhibit a high external quantum efficiency of 4.6% and an excellent color purity of (0.150, 0.078) as well as good thermal properties that improve the lifetimes of OLED devices (Table 6). In continuation of this, Park and co-workers also reported fluorophore 96 based on indenopyrazine with deep-blue emission, and compared it with 94.87 Fluorophore 94 effectively prevents intermolecular interactions, resulting in blue-shifted emission. The EL spectrum of 94 was more blue-shifted than that of 96 and the external quantum efficiency of 94 (2.68%) was higher than that of 96 (1.61%).

Xu et al. designed and synthesized non-doped stable blue-light emitting material 97 with strong electron-accepting groups that facilitate the injection and transport of electrons.88 6,7-Dimethyl-2,3-di-(4-(2,3,4,5-tetraphenylphenyl)phenyl)quinoxaline (MPQ) was also synthesized to operate as an exciplex-eliminating OLED layer. The OLED device fabricated with chromophore 97 as an emission layer and MPQ as an exciplex-eliminating layer using air-stable Al cathodes exhibited a maximum luminance of 6230 cd m−2 and a maximum current efficiency of 5.2 cd A−1 with an operating voltage of 11.6 V.
To probe the interaction between donors and acceptors, Fung et al. designed and synthesized a novel deep-blue fluorescent emitter, 98, based on twisting carbazole-benzofuro[2,3-b]pyrazine.89 The doped device based on 98 exhibited an excellent performance with an EQE of 4.34% corresponding to color coordinates of (0.15, 0.05). Also the triplet energy had a value of 2.7 eV, which makes it a preferred choice for white OLEDs. The color of hybrid-white OLEDs could be tunable from warm white to cool white by optimizing the device. The EQE and power efficiency of the hybrid warm-white OLED are as high as 20.1% and 63.5 lm W−1 with CIE coordinates of (0.34, 0.33).
In continuation of this, Fung and co-workers also reported a benzofuro[2,3-b]pyrazine (BFPz) based emitter (99) with triphenylamine as a donor.90 The absorption spectrum displays two pronounced absorption peaks corresponding to n–π* and ICT transitions (Fig. 21). The OLED device fabricated with a non-doped emitting material showed a lower driving voltage of 3.4 V and a maximum current efficiency of 8.0 cd A−1 with an external quantum efficiency of 3.68%. In order to further improve the device performance, the device structure was optimized with an ITO/HAT-CN/TAPC/DPEPO:99/TmpyPB/Liq/Al configuration, in which DPEPO serves as a host material. As shown in Fig. 21c all the doped devices exhibited better performance than the non-doped OLED. When the doping concentration of 99 was 30%, the D–A based OLED exhibits maximum efficiencies of 11.5 cd A−1, 10.3 lm W−1 and 4.42% with CIE coordinates of (0.19, 0.44).

3.2.2 Blue to orange emitters. 
Zhu and co-workers synthesized a new series of organic-light-emitting materials 100–103 that varied from blue to green owing to the different strengths of the donors and acceptors (Fig. 22).91 For compounds 102 and 103, the LUMO levels are decreased because of the incorporation of electron-accepting groups, so the devices based on these two compounds display better electron transportation/injection properties. The non-doped device based on fluorophore 100 showed a maximum EQE of 1.79% due to the relatively good hole/electron recombination for the appropriate acceptor and the donor accepting ability. The results demonstrate that the chromophores can be tuned by changing the electron-donor and electron-acceptor, and hole/electron recombination can also be adjusted to optimize the device performance.
 Fig. 22  Pyrazine-based blue to orange emitters 100–111. 
Thomas et al. synthesized dipolar compounds 104–109 featuring a quinoxaline acceptor and various triarylamine donors with tunable emission for OLED application.92 The emission colors of these materials were tuned from bluish green to orange by changing the nature of the amine and quinoxaline units. The device based on compound 104 exhibited good performance with an EQEmax of 1.8%, a PEmax of 2.61 lm W−1, and a brightness of 5399 cd m−2 at 6.5 V. Incorporation of the quinoxaline unit in the HTL leads to the confinement of the excitons. Thus it is possible to make three-in-one molecules possessing HT, emitter and ET characteristics.
In an approach to create full-color fluorescent materials, Zhang and co-workers designed and synthesized phenazine-based derivative 110 for OLED application,93 which can emit blue light in toluene solution (450 nm), green light in the powder/film state (502/562 nm), and red light with addition of TFA (610 nm) as displayed in Fig. 23. The absorption spectrum of 110 was not significantly influenced by changing the solvent from toluene to chloroform, but the protonation at the pyrazine unit caused a dramatic red-shift. The OLED [ITO/ZnO/110/CBP/MoO3/Al] device with chromophore 110 emits a strong green light at a peak of 536 nm with a maximum luminance of about 8600 cd m−2 and EQEmax of 0.33% at 2.8 V. The oxygen atoms in 110 can absorb photons that generate oxygen vacancies upon excitation, and this is useful for PL emission.

In order to get longer-wavelength emission, Nishihara et al. recently prepared disilane-bridged D–A–D based organic dye 111 by introducing strongly electron-donating diphenylamino groups into the thienopyrazine core containing a Si–Si moiety.94 Because of the intramolecular charge-transfer transition, dye 111 exhibited green fluorescence with a λem of 524 nm. The undoped OLED device [ITO/α-NPD/111/LiF/Al] exhibited saturated green electroluminescence with a maximum EQE of 0.65% at 1 × 10−3 A cm−2, which is sufficiently bright for practical application.
To illustrate the molecular structure–property relationship, Wang et al. synthesized a series of TADF emitters 112–117 using 2,3-dicyanopyrazino phenanthrene (DCPP) as the electron acceptor, and carbazole, diphenylamine or 9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine (DMAC) as the electron donor (Fig. 24).95 These TADF molecules show yellow (560 nm) to deep-red (650 nm) emission due to their enhanced electron-donating groups and elongated conjugation lengths. The oxidation reactions of these emitters were irreversible, due to the electrochemical oxidative coupling reaction of carbazole units (Fig. 25). OLED devices were fabricated with 10 wt% emitter:host doped films to study the impact of TADF molecules. The OLED devices based on these emitters exhibited high efficiencies of 47.6 cd A−1 (14.8%) for 112, 34.5 cd A−1 (14.8%) for 117, 12.8 cd A−1 (10.1%) for 114, and 13.2 cd A−1 (15.1%) for 116, respectively. The devices based on carbazole and diphenylamine based emitters suffered from severe efficiency roll-offs due to their large ΔEST and longer delayed fluorescence. Thus, the molecules should be carefully designed for fabricating low efficiency roll-off OLEDs.

Minakata and co-workers reported novel U-shaped D–A–D π-conjugated multi-functional molecules 118 comprising dibenzo[a,j]phenazine as an acceptor and phenothiazines as donors for OLED application.96 The compound also exhibits distinct multi-color-changing mechanochromic luminescence. OLED devices [ITO/NPB/118/CBP/TPBi/LiF/Al] fabricated based on dye 118 exhibited orange emission at 613 nm with a maximum efficiency of 19.6 cd A−1 and EQEmax up to 16.8%, which significantly surpasses the theoretical maximum (∼5%) of conventional fluorescent materials.
Thomas et al. designed and synthesized a new class of star-shaped thieno-[3,4-b]pyrazine based electroluminescent materials 119 and 120 as dual functional layers.97 A double-layer OLED device fabricated with these compounds as the emitting layer and hole-transporting layer displays red emission with CIE color coordinates (0.65, 0.33) and (0.59, 0.33), respectively. In comparison to dye 119 (0.5%), the device based on dye 120 exhibited slightly higher performance, with an EQE of 0.82% and a brightness of 556 cd A−1. Although the device exhibited relatively lower luminance efficiencies, but it displayed pure red emission.
Li and co-workers reported two novel red fluorescent thieno-[3,4-b]pyrazine derivatives 121 and 122 containing tetraphenylethylene as a peripheral group which enables the compounds to form a three-dimensional geometry.98 Vacuum-deposited non-doped OLEDs using these fluorophores as emitting layers exhibit pure saturated red fluorescence with CIE color coordinates of (0.65, 0.32) and (0.66, 0.30), respectively. The device based on the 121 luminophore exhibited a low turn-on voltage (4.5 V) and a maximum luminance efficiency of 0.66 cd A−1. This report provides a practical strategy to develop highly efficient but planar chromophores for application in non-doped OLEDs.


3.2.3 Red to near IR (NIR) emitters. 
Liu and co-workers synthesized novel red-emitting thieno-[3,4-b]pyrazine cored dendrimers with oligo-carbazole dendrons 123–125 for solution-processable OLEDs (Fig. 26).99 As shown in Fig. 27a two extra bands are detected in these emitters in the range of 430–370 nm because of the presence of carbazole units. Also the observed multiple oxidation waves are due to the introduction of the carbazole dendrons (Fig. 27). OLED devices fabricated by a spin coating technique using these dendritic materials as non-doped emitting layers exhibit pure and saturated red florescence with CIE color coordinates of (0.67, 0.31) for 123, (0.66, 0.33) for 124, and (0.66, 0.34) for 125. The introduction of a polyphenyl spacer between the core and the first generation carbazole dendrons decreases the ICT efficiency in dye 125. Hence the device based on dye 125 exhibits much better device performance than those based on 123 and 124. A brightness of 925 cd m−2 and a luminous efficiency of 0.53 cd A−1 are obtained for dye 125 (Table 7).

Liu et al. also reported thieno-[3.4-b]pyrazine cored dendrimers containing polyphenyl dendrons 126 and 127.100 The bulky dendrons enable these molecules to be solution-processable. Both dendritic material based OLEDs exhibited saturated red EL with peaks at 646 and 642 nm and CIE coordinates of (0.65, 0.33) and (0.65, 0.34) for 126 and 127, respectively. The OLEDs had an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/EML/BCP/Alq3/LiF/Al configuration. The OLED devices based on 126 and 127 have tum-on voltages of 6 and 4.5 V, respectively. N-Phenyl-naphthalene amine groups at the periphery of 127 contribute to the hole transporting process and increase the current density and luminance of the OLEDs. The device based on 127 reached a maximum brightness of 1020 cd m−2 and luminance efficiency of 0.56 cd A−1.
Takeda et al. synthesized three novel bipolar compounds 128–130 as green-to-red/NIR thermally activated delayed fluorescence organic light emitters based on dibenzo[a,j]phenazine (Fig. 28).101 The device based on 130 exhibited a maximum EQE of 16%, a high luminance of 1000 cd m−2 (12.4 lm W−1, 30.5 cd A−1). For the devices based on 128 and 129, the efficiencies were about half, which could be explained by two factors, higher ΔEST compared to emitter 130 and long-lived delayed fluorescence emission in these materials, leading to potentially high charge quenching of the excited states. A series of new D–A–D type NIR fluorescent chromophores 131–133 were synthesized by Wang et al. based on [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline as an electron acceptor and triphenylamine as an electron donor.102 The doped OLEDs with Alq3 as a host emit NIR light from 748 to 870 nm. In particular, the device containing compound 131 as a dopant emitter (2 wt%) exhibits an exclusive NIR EL at 752 nm with an EQE of 1.12% over a wide range of current densities.
 Fig. 28  Pyrazine based red to NIR emitters 128–136. 
Recently, Liao and co-workers designed and synthesized the wedge-shaped novel NIR OLED emitter 134 with thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties.103 The non-doped device exhibited NIR emission with a peak wavelength of 777 nm and a high EQE of 2.19%. Remarkably, when 10% of 134 is doped into a 1,3,5-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole-2-yl)benzene host, an extremely high EQE of 10.19% with an emission peak of 693 nm is achieved.
Qiao and co-workers developed highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence via J-aggregates with strong ICT.104 Two organic D–A molecules 135 and 136 with strong and planar acceptors are designed and synthesized with wide tuning from the yellow to NIR region. J-Aggregates mix Frenkel excitons and CT excitons, which contributes to a fast radiative decay rate and a slow nonradiative decay, but significantly decreases the band gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states to induce high-efficiency TADF in the NIR region. The devices based on chromophores 135 and 136 exhibited maximum EQEs of 15.8% and 14.1% with EL peaks at 630 and 657 nm, respectively.

3.3 Active channel materials for OFETs
Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) are of great interest because of their applications in plastic electronics such as electronic papers and flexible displays.105 The development of good n-type materials is crucial for the fabrication of p–n junctions, bipolar transistors106 and integrated circuits.107 However, to date, n-type semiconductors with high mobility have relatively rarely been reported and significantly lagged behind p-type semiconductors, due to the low stability of n-type semiconductors in air. Therefore, the search for n-type semiconductors with high performance and environmental stability is currently a challenge. An effective approach to n-type semiconductors is to convert p-type materials to n-type ones by introducing strong electron-withdrawing groups (–CN, –Cl, –F, –CF3, –CO, –NO2).108–112 Furthermore, n-type semiconductors containing a pyrazine ring are developed, because an electron withdrawing group decreases the LUMO levels of materials for electron injection.113
The operation principle of OFETs relies on the application of an electric field that causes the formation of a conducting channel in the dielectric/semiconductor interface. Fig. 29 shows the three main configurations employed in OFETs. Generally, higher FET performance is observed with a top contact configuration than a bottom contact configuration because of better contacts between the electrodes and the semiconductor in the former.
 Fig. 29  Three common OFET configurations employed: bottom gate, bottom contact (BG–BC); bottom gate, top contact (BG–TC); and top gate, bottom contact (TG–BC). 
With the aim of designing high-performance n-type organic semiconductors, Yamashita et al. synthesized heterocyclic co-oligomers 137 and 138 containing a pyrazine ring by the Stille coupling reaction of 2-bromo-5-iodopyrazine (Fig. 30).114 Bithienyl derivative 137 showed p-type FET characteristics with a hole mobility of 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1. On the other hand, trifluoromethylphenyl derivative 138 showed n-type FET characteristics with an electron mobility of 0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1. The introduction of the electron-accepting unit is an effective way to increase electron mobility and decrease the threshold voltage. The field-effect characteristics of all the compounds are summarized in Table 8.

Yamashita et al. also reported high-performance n- and p-type FETs based on tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives (139–142).115 The FET devices fabricated with tetrahalogeno derivatives 139 and 140 displayed n-type behavior with mobilities of 0.10 and 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively. Dihalogeno derivatives still demonstrated typical p-type characteristics with mobilities of 0.20 and 0.64 cm2 V−1 s−1 for derivatives 141 and 142, respectively. The results show that the introduction of halogen groups determined the FET polarity by controlling the HOMO and LUMO levels of the molecules.
A series of halogen and alkyl substituted diindenopyrazinediones (143–149) and bis(dicyanomethylene) derivatives 150 and 151 have been synthesized by Yamashita and co-workers.116,117 Among all the compounds, a bottom contact FET device fabricated with 151 exhibited the highest electron mobility of 5.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Halogen groups were effective in enhancing the electron-accepting abilities of the compounds and improved the FET performance, and alkyl groups were effective in enhancing the solubility.
In order to study the influence of cyano (CN) substitution on the energy levels of dipyrrolo pyrazinedione molecules, density functional theory calculations were carried out by Li et al. Then they synthesized n-type semiconductors 152 and 153 containing cyano-disubstituted dipyrrolo pyrazinedione (CNPzDP),118 which are potentially useful for solution-processed OFETs. Devices fabricated with these PzDP molecules showed unipolar n-type behavior with electron mobilities up to 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on–off ratio of 106 under ambient conditions.
Zhan and coworkers synthesized three new fused-ring pyrazine derivatives 154–156 functionalized with trifluoromethylphenyl groups for n-type OFETs.119 The pyrazine core plays a significant role in tuning the electrochemical properties of these compounds and also lowers the LUMO level and leads to a more ordered thin film morphology with large grain size which helps in improving mobilities. The compounds exhibit different morphologies with a large piece-like crystalline phase at RT and a smooth layer by layer structure at 100 °C as observed in AFM images (Fig. 31). The OFET devices based on 154 and 155 compounds exhibit electron mobilities of 1.2 × 10−2 and 1.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively, under nitrogen, and their performance is sensitive to the pyrazine core. The higher mobility of 154 is attributed to its larger fused-ring structure and higher electron affinity. However the 156 based device did not show OFET characteristics because of its deficient π-conjugated system.

Tao and co-workers utilized single crystals of 5,7,12,14-tetrachloro-6,13-diazapentacene (TCDAP, 157) to fabricate n-channel OFETs (Fig. 32).120 The introduction of a nitrogen atom in an oligoacene molecule results in higher electron affinity, a less negative reduction potential and ambient stability. They also provide cofacial packing due to possible CH⋯N interactions. A single crystal of compound 157 was grown by a vapor phase transfer method to afford 1.0–2.5 cm long needles. A top contact, top-gate FET was prepared by placing the crystal on a glass substrate (Fig. 33). The single-crystal field-effect transistor based on 157 with parylene as a gate insulator showed a high electron mobility of up to 3.39 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of 1.08 × 104 under ambient conditions.

Maio et al. synthesized two electron-transporting materials, 5,7,12,14-tetraaza-6,13-pentacenequinone (158) and 6,11-diaza-5,12-tetracenequinone (159), having unusual quadruple weak hydrogen bonds via condensation and oxidation reactions.121 For thin-film transistors based on 158, fabricated with gold source/drain electrodes, the electron mobility reached 0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1 in a vacuum, which decreased to 2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 under ambient conditions. On the other hand, thin film transistors of 159 showed much lower electron mobility, due to the low crystallinity of the films, as molecular order and solid-state structure play vital roles in OFETs.122
In order to study the relationship between the nitrogen position and molecular properties, Liang et al. introduced nitrogen into TIPS-pentacene to form transistors 160–163.123,124 The semiconductor properties of all the materials were tested in vacuum-deposited thin films. It was found that 160 functioned as a p-type semiconductor (1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1), and 161 and 162 functioned as ambipolar semiconductors, while 163 functioned as an n-type semiconductor with a field effect mobility of 3.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 under ambient conditions. In order to fabricate high-performance OFETs of TIPS-pentacene from solution, Wang and co-workers developed single crystals of 163 from solution using poor solvents as shown in Fig. 34.125 With gluing silver films as source and drain electrodes, the crystals exhibited high performance and reveal the intrinsic properties of organic semiconductors due to the ordered arrangement of molecules, free of grain boundaries and minimal defects. The crystals exhibited a field effect mobility of up to 1.77 cm2 V−1 s−1.

Miao and coworkers reported an n-type organic semiconductor based on 6,13-bis((triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl)-5,7,12,14-tetraazapentacene (164).126 Solution processed n-channel OTFTs of 164 exhibited field effect mobilities as high as 11 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature and a band-like temperature dependence of electron mobility. Wang et al.127 reported a large π-conjugated N-heteroquinone (9-ring). Bottom-contact FETs fabricated with single crystals of 165 were tested with Ag source and drain contacts. The highest electron mobility of 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained under ambient conditions. The devices showed no obvious degradation after storage for one month under ambient conditions. Typically 165 is not sufficiently electron-withdrawing to enable electron transport on its own, but when it is combined with other electron-withdrawing groups (CN, F), low lying LUMO levels can be achieved and electron transport enabled.
Jenekhe and co-workers synthesized tetraazabenzodifluoranthene diimide (BFI) derivatives (166–168).128 OFETs with a bottom-gate geometry were fabricated by solution deposition of thin films to investigate their field-effect mobility. All the BFIs were found to display n-type characteristics in the OFETs. The 166 thin films had the highest carrier mobility of 0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1. The electron mobilities of 167 and 168 were 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.021 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Although 168 had the highest electron affinity, it had the lowest mobility, due to its poor solid state packing.
Diazatetracene diimide based compounds 169–171 with high electron affinity were prepared for n-channel organic field effect transistors.129 The LUMO levels of these molecules were found to be closely related to their material stability. Bottom-gate top-contact OFETs of compounds 169 and 170 were used for solution processable n-channel device (Fig. 35) and exhibited average electron mobilities of 0.002 and 0.005 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The threshold voltage was around 10 V for thin films. Compound 171 with an ultra-high electron affinity of 4.66 eV was isolated but it was very sensitive to water and silica gel. This study has shed light on how to control the LUMO energy levels to balance the device stability and material stability to improve the device performance.

Recently, Min et al. proposed a novel strategy to design n-type acenes through the introduction of boron–nitrogen coordination bonds (B ← N)130 which exhibit low lying LUMO energy levels and high electron affinities. The film of 172 was destroyed by the solvent during spin coating. However, solution-processed OFETs with a top-gate bottom-contact configuration fabricated with 173 showed unipolar n-type characteristics with an electron mobility of 0.21 cm2 V−1 s−1and an on/off current ratio of 105–106; the devices also exhibited good stability in air.
4. Summary and outlook
This review summarizes recent work on the application of pyrazine-based materials in solar cells, light emitting diodes and field effect transistors. The introduction of heteroatoms in place of sp3-bridged carbon atoms showed impressive efficiencies, due to the planar structure of the pyrazine core. Various structural modifications of a pyrazine fused fragment consisting of both an electron-rich group and an electron-deficient group were studied. Apart from simple D–π–A systems, sensitizers with additional acceptor groups (D–A–π–A) and dyes with an extended conjugation (D–π–A–π–A) were studied, which proved to be promising candidates because of their broadened absorption spectra. This opens the door to the development of high-performance optoelectronic materials using new synthetic methods and new π-conjugated building blocks.
Pyrazine derivatives were also found to be very effective as emissive fluorophores which help in enhancing the overall quantum efficiency of blue to NIR OLED devices. Pyrazine-based fluorophores have some advantages, such as rigid skeletons and high thermal stability, leading to promising application in high-performance OLEDs. Devices fabricated with new pyrazine-based TADF emitters have achieved high EQEs of up to 16.8%, which significantly exceeds the theoretical maximum of conventional fluorescent emitters. Therefore organic fluorophores with a pyrazine core are promising materials for all types of OLED. For OFET application, electronic and molecular structures and molecular packing play important roles. Pyrazine based semiconductors help in extending the family to n-type semiconductors and exhibited electron mobilities as high as 11 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature. The successful strides made towards pyrazine-based optoelectronic devices will prove to be of enormous environmental and sustainable value to our society.
