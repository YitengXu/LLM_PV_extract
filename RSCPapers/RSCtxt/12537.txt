The present review focuses on recent work on robust earth-abundant heterogeneous catalysts based on pristine MOFs for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and overall water splitting. These catalysts have been extensively studied as alternatives for noble metal-based ones, demonstrating “hydrogen economy” development prospects. In addition, novel strategies to enhance the conductivity, chemical stability and efficiency of MOF-based electrocatalysts are discussed. The best electrocatalysts even surpass the achievements of the platinum group of metals and MOF-derived catalysts in catalytic performance. The electrolytic cells with MOF-modified electrodes demonstrated excellent catalytic activity and can deliver a high current density at a voltage lower than that using the precious metal-based Pt/C cathodes and IrO2 anodes. In this review article, current approaches to design such MOF and MOF-modified electrode materials are summarized and analyzed.Yulia H. BudnikovaYulia H.

1. Introduction
Clean, sustainable and affordable energy is one of the major necessities of modern society.1–8 It should be recognized that we are currently witnessing the emergence of a new reality in global energy. Much attention is being paid to the conversion of traditional production technologies in heat and electricity to a new hydrogen economy. An utilization of molecular hydrogen is one of the possible ways for ensuring a rational, environmentally safe and sustainable development of the modern industry. The Stone Age ended not because people ran out of stones. The situation with oil and gas is the same now. The world is entering an era of renewable sources. Decarbonization of fuel and technology is an urgent need for mankind. Hydrogen is an ideal energy material of the future, and the decomposition of water using solar/electric energy is one of the ways to obtain it.9–16 It is noteworthy that hydrogen has the highest gravimetric energy density among all known substances, i.e. a lower heating value (LHV) of ∼120 kJ g−1.13 This is a pure source of energy, since only water is produced during its combustion (ideally). Hydrogen-based fuel cells, the so-called H2/O2 fuel cell technologies, produce only water and heat as by-products.17–21 Fuel cells are considered very promising in the global energy market in developed countries.
Catalysts, both electrochemical and photochemical, are crucial for various renewable energy supply schemes. Molecular catalysts driving fuel synthesis offer enormous potential for fine-tuning product rate and selectivity.22–25 However, such molecular catalysts when in the homogeneous phase usually do not survive long enough to be of practical use, being unstable, especially in an acidic medium, and are characterized by a relatively high overvoltage5 even if they are made of relatively inexpensive earth-abundant metals.26 To date, very active molecular catalysts have been developed, however, they usually cannot find industrial application.
Great successes in solving this problem were achieved through the incorporation of promising molecular catalysts into materials.27–29 This approach provides several advantages: greater stability, both chemical and electrochemical, in time is achieved; catalyst recyclability increases and, of course, there is the possibility of practical usage in real devices – electrodes for electrolyzers, fuel cells, etc. The matrix can be used to adjust the selectivity and activity of the catalyst, including overvoltage reduction, and the catalytic centers can be constantly supplied with electrons through contact with the electrode.
Сoordination polymers, primarily porous coordination ones or metal organic frameworks (MOFs), have proved to be one such versatile platform for the embedding of molecular catalyst units. MOFs themselves have the advantage of molecular compounds via the usage of well-defined multidentate molecular linkers and metal clusters (secondary building units) as the components for the bulk framework,30,31 yielding in porous materials an exceptionally high internal surface area. Developing such catalysts by a fine adjustment of the main structure, with these catalysts being separate blocks based on one or several metals and connected with various linkers, anionic fragments, or ligands, allows us to define the factors of overall activity and durability of these catalysts, as well as increase their functional characteristics.
Despite the potential usage of MOFs as components in fuel-forming electrocatalytic devices, the vast majority of MOFs are insulating materials. The development of MOFs, which provide the flow of electrons, has attracted attention over the past decade with the use of two main strategies: namely, the design of conductive or semiconductive MOFs by carefully overlapping the molecular orbitals of molecular components,32,33 and the engineering of MOFs from redox-active components that allow the charge of electrons/holes to jump.34–36
The development of redox-active MOFs, in particular, ones with a low energy band gap, is a primary goal. These materials provide unique insights into charge transfer in coordination with space at a fundamental level. At an applied level, their properties may be based on the next generation of technologically advanced devices. A synergetic effect between the framework electronic and porous properties has provided new applications for these MOFs in a wide range of fields, including catalysis.37–39 It is necessary to note the clear trend towards MOFs based on outer coordination sphere effects, such as proton transfer relays and hydrogen bonding. This leads to the supposition that catalytic sites in MOFs could attain the tunability and complexity of enzyme active sites.40
The principles of biomimetics in the design of new catalysts are very appropriate, especially for reactions that are catalyzed by enzymes in nature. A search for new and effective catalysts based on non-precious and widely spread metals (Ni, Co, Fe, and others) often gives a reason to take into account the regularities and functional characteristics of natural catalysts – enzymes and hydrogenases (in the hydrogen evolution reaction, HER, and overall water splitting).41 In these systems, a transfer of electrons is carried out through the Fe4S4 cluster system, when proton/hydrogen is delivered to the final active center through the channels. This provides the reagents an accurate supply and the product is outputted from the catalytically active metal center. Being the most effective catalysts for proton and electron conversion into hydrogen (including the reverse reaction of hydrogen oxidation), natural hydrogenases have inspired chemists to develop simpler synthetic catalysts (their structural and functional models with common ground metals). It is very difficult to replicate the active center's macroenvironment, the molecular channels, but this is hardly necessary, since the goal is to design simpler structures with similar and even higher catalytic characteristics (TOF), and lower hydrogen overvoltage. The design of MOF pores for enabling quick access for the electrolyte and substrate to active catalyst sites will be crucial for achieving high current densities.42
The enzyme's ability to preorganize protons and electrons around active sites is a field of particular interest. To date, a wide range of new MOFs and their derivatives based on widespread metals have been synthesized and applied to electrocatalytic reactions connected with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), water splitting, and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which are key processes in the synthesis of hydrogen fuel and functioning of fuel cells.
Several interesting reviews in this blooming field have appeared in recent years.43–52 However, unlike molecular catalysts,41,53,54 the oxidation of hydrogen catalyzed by MOFs has not yet been achieved. Currently, substantial progress is being made in the development of MOF-based electrocatalysts, and new findings are continuously being reported.43–52 In this regard, a timely summary of encouraging works in this field is of great significance for guiding the development of improved MOF-based electrocatalysts for the HER and overall water splitting. At this point, herein, a comprehensive review focusing on the design strategies towards intact MOF based HER and overall water splitting electrocatalysts is provided, and techniques like carbon matrix modification, morphology tuning and electrode engineering are discussed. Moreover, this review also introduces the fundamentals of electrocatalytic H2 and O2 evolution to establish the dependence of the activity on the structure and method for modifying the electrode surface and highlight the urgent challenges with respect to the future development of MOF structures for electrocatalytic HER or overall water splitting. The catalytic properties of these new electrocatalysts, which are based on pristine or intact MOFs and published primarily in the last 3 years, are analyzed and summarized in this review.
2. Parameters used to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity
Ten high-priority electrochemical fundamental parameters, namely overpotential η at a defined current density, iR-corrected overpotential at a defined current density, Tafel slope (TS), exchange current density (j0), mass activity, specific activity, faradaic efficiency (FE), turnover frequency (TOF), electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and measurement of double layer capacitance (Cdl) for different electrocatalytic materials are frequently employed in both the OER and HER.
Given the flurry of work in this field, there is a certain difficulty in comparing these parameters obtained by different authors in different conditions, because these are not always specified in detail. Some authors justifiably criticize the precision and the correctness in the evaluation of activity parameters in some cases for electrocatalytic water splitting.55,56 The limitations and inappropriateness of η@10 mA cmgeo−2 (geo – geometric) and the Tafel slope (derived from iR-corrected LSV) in assessing a given electrocatalyst for electrochemical water splitting have been discussed and given in detail.55,56 Both η@10 mA cmgeo−2 and Tafel slopes are highly dependent on the mass of the catalyst, and they will vary with the varying loading.
As a consequence, it is concluded that neither η@10 mA cmgeo−2 nor Tafel slopes can reflect the intrinsic activity of a catalyst, and this can lead to false interpretations. To overcome this problem, the use of η@10 mA cmECSA−2 (ECSA – electrochemical surface area), ECSA-normalized current density, and TOF, which have been proved to reflect the intrinsic activity of the studied catalyst regardless of the loaded amount of catalyst, has been proposed and recommended.55,56 However, by analyzing the latest achievements in the development of electrocatalysts, we will focus on the reported electrochemical parameters, not paying attention to possible inaccuracies and trusting the authors.
Electrochemical splitting of water involves two main half-reactions, the cathodic HER (the hydrogen evolution reaction) and the anodic OER (the oxygen evolution reaction),13,14,37,57 as described by the equations in Fig. 1. As one of the two half-reactions in water splitting, the HER consists of two stages. The first step is the absorption of the hydrogen atom formed during the discharge of H2O or H3O+ at the active site (Volmer reaction).49,58 The second step is the formation and evolution of dihydrogen. It is important to note that there are two ways to complete this step,49,58 One of them is the Heyrovsky reaction, in which hydrogen is formed as a result of electrochemical desorption, and the other is known as the Tafel reaction, in which hydrogen is formed after chemical desorption (Fig. 1). Based on the above reaction pathways, the mechanism of the HER can be attributed to one of two types, that is, Volmer–Heyrovsky and Volmer–Tafel. These two mechanisms can be active in both acidic and alkaline solutions, and they depend on the electrolyte content and nature of the catalyst.58,59 Discussions about the mechanisms of these electrode reactions under various conditions continue.60–62

It is known, that the HER is fast when compared to the OER, but the HER is slower under alkaline conditions than under acidic conditions, and numerous studies were recently dedicated to reveal the physical origin of such an effect.62 Thus, since the introduction of a new “bifunctional” mechanism in which non-covalent interactions play a critical role in the HER kinetics, novel studies focusing on the effect of non-covalent interactions, adsorbed species, etc. on model electrodes were carried out. These studies and the emergence of high-resolution operando spectroscopy or laser-based techniques combined with theoretical/computational studies made possible an in-depth understanding of the water structure at the electrode–electrolyte interface, and demonstrated the influence of the double-layer structure on surface adsorption properties.62
The Tafel slope for the HER is widely used to identify the dominant reaction mechanism and reaction kinetics within a specific potential window, which can be calculated using the simplified Tafel formula (η = b·logj + a, in which η, j, a and b represent overvoltage, current density, the adjusted constant and the Tafel slope, respectively).63 As a rule, when the Volmer, Geyrovsky and Tafel mechanisms prevail in the HER process, the corresponding values of b are approximately 116, 38, and 29 mV dec−1 (Fig. 1). Besides, lower b values are associated with faster reaction kinetics. In addition to the Tafel slope, the exchange current density (j0) can also be calculated using the simplified Tafel formula, when η is 0. j0 is considered an important indicator for evaluating catalytic efficiency, and this is related to the state of the electrode surface and the area of the catalytic surface. A large value of j0 means faster electron transfer and a favorable catalytic surface area.63
The Tafel slope cannot be used for predicting the mechanism of the OER as readily as for the HER due to the relatively large number of intermediate steps involved in the anodic half-cell reaction of water electrolysis.55 A variety of mechanisms have been proposed for the OER in both acidic and alkaline conditions with various metal oxide/hydroxide electrocatalysts. Among these, the oxide path and electrochemical oxide path are the most widely recognized. In an acidic medium, four different paths for the OER have been proposed to date, including the most widely accepted oxide and electrochemical oxide paths in addition to the Krasil'shchikov path and Wade and Hackerman's path. The elementary steps involved in all four pathways are proposed,55 but it is obvious that for coordination polymers, especially for pristine MOFs, these paths are not suitable, since the formation of oxides is an irreversible destruction of the catalyst.
The major difference in the first elementary steps of the OER in acidic and in alkali conditions is the adsorption of water and hydroxide ions on the surface active site. The most important and common step to be emphasized here is that the active site undergoes a cycle of oxidation and reduction reactions during the OER in both acidic and alkaline conditions with all proposed mechanisms to evolve O2 molecules and regenerate the surface sites for the next cycle. This means that only metals with variable and stable oxidation states can act as efficient electrocatalysts for the OER.
The catalytic activity depends on a few significant characteristics of the catalyst in addition to a favorable electronic configuration and variable oxidation states. One important requirement is the appropriate bond strength of the intermediates formed in the elementary steps.55,64,65 However, it has recently been proposed that the Tafel slope can be used to predict the number of electron transfers that occurred, from which the rate determining step of the OER can be proposed (ref. 55 and refs therein). However, this correlation in the HER would be relatively less significant, since it is already possible to determine the mechanism by which the HER occurs based on the Tafel slope values for a given electrocatalyst. Like the HER, the kinetics of the OER depends on the abundance of surface-active centers that direct the OER mechanism to a particular catalytic interface.
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key process in fuel cells and metal–air batteries. Catalytic activity trends in the oxygen reduction reaction have been described in recent reviews.43,66 The overall efficiencies of these devices are severely limited by the sluggish ORR. Depending on the catalyst, both the two- and four-electron oxygen reduction pathways are possible. The two-electron, partial reduction pathway results in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as the product and involves OOH* as a reaction intermediate, while the full reduction of oxygen to water involves four reduction steps. Usually, as a consequence of the higher reaction kinetics and efficiency, the 4-electron pathway is preferred.43,66 Although incredible successes have been achieved, the development of MOF-based electrocatalysts for the ORR is in its infancy, and there are still many challenges for further research on more efficient MOF-based electrocatalysts towards the ORR, some of which have been considered in recent reviews43,50,66 and, therefore, will not be discussed in detail here.
No doubt, any activity parameter that is proposed for an electrocatalyst must be related to one or more of the following essential criteria: activity, stability and selectivity.
3. Electrocatalysts based on pristine MOFs for the hydrogen evolution reaction
The principal advantages of metal–organic frameworks are their designable structure with a clear chemistry, large channels, and a high surface area. MOF-based materials can be defined as pristine MOFs, MOF composites, and MOF-derived materials. However, according to recent studies, most pristine MOFs are often rarely utilized as electrocatalysts, including for HER catalysis, due to the low conductivity and relative instability in acidic or alkaline media. In this regard, in recent years, various strategies have been developed to improve the catalytic performance of MOF-based composites for electrochemical reactions without the need for post-treatment. Advanced MOF-based electrocatalysts usually include highly conductive and electrochemically active pristine MOFs, MOFs in combination with conductive substrates, and MOFs hybridized with active materials. However, some of the best achievements are associated with a successful design of the catalyst framework itself.
Pristine MOF is applied to the electrode in different ways: a working electrode is coated with the ink of the as-prepared catalysts, the Nafion solution fixes the catalyst, and the MOF is mixed with graphite (this is a traditional carbon paste electrode) or acetylene black; during the synthesis, the MOF precipitates directly on the electrode itself or graphene (graphene oxide) surfaces, etc. Being a part of such a modified electrode, an electrically conductive component is necessary in all cases. Since the structure of the MOF remains unchanged and determines the catalytic properties, all of these approaches will be considered in the present review.
In 2020, Yu Chen and colleagues suggested a new conjugated ligand with an extra active metallic center boosting the structural advantages of conductive MOFs, called hexaiminohexaazatrinaphthalene (HAHATN).67 It was employed as a conjugated ligand to construct bimetallic sited conductive 2D MOFs (M23(M13·HAHATN)2) (M = Ni, Co, Cu) with an extra M–N2 moiety (Fig. 2). Both theoretical and experimental results indicate that the bidentate-based metal site (M–N2) possesses higher activity than that of the M–N4 linkage for the HER. Ni3(Ni3·HAHAT)2 nanosheets, the bimetallic sited conductive MOFs with optimal chemical compositions in this work, exhibit outstanding HER performances in alkaline solution, such as a low overpotential η10 of 115 mV at 10 mA cm−2, small Tafel slope (TS) of 45.6 mV dec−1, and excellent electrocatalytic stability. The η10 values of the HER on Ni3(Cu3·HAHATN)2, Ni3(Co3·HAHATN)2, and Ni3(Ni3·HAHATN)2 are 207, 162, and 115 mV, respectively (Table 1, line 1). Obviously, the gradually enhanced HER activity indicates the active discrepancy of the metal ionic species, Cu–N2 < Co–N2 < Ni–N2, which is another strong evidence for an M1−N2-based active center in M23(M13·HAHATN)2. TEM images show these M23(M13·HAHATN)2 possess wrinkled thin-layered morphologies with a thickness of 1–2 nm. Compared to similar reports on MOF- or MOF-derived electrocatalysts,15,35,40–50,57–59 the electroactivity of Ni3(Ni3·HAHATN)2 exhibits obvious superiority in this field (Table 1). TEM and SEM characterization show that the electrocatalytic process cannot break the 2D structure of the Ni3(Ni3·HAHATN)2 nanosheets.67 The results reveal that the rigid conjugated coordinated structure makes Ni3(Ni3·HAHATN)2 possess good durability during the HER process. This high durability was confirmed by voltammetric and chrono-amperometric measurements. After 1000 cycles, the η10 only displays a tiny deformation, relative to that of the initial scan. After a 10 h test at 10 mA cm−2, the HER current reveals a negligible attenuation, which maintains 83.4% of the initial activity. Thus, employing the HATN (hexaazatriphenylene) analog as a conjugated organic ligand is an effective strategy for correcting the deficiencies of traditional conductive MOFs in the field of electrocatalysis, which has extraordinary significance for the design and synthesis of next-generation conductive MOF-based electrocatalysts.67

Novel 3D Ni and Co redox-active metal–organic frameworks based on ferrocenyl diphosphinate and 4,4′-bipyridine ligands are efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction.68 Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis suggests the orthorhombic space group Pnna for these MOFs (Fig. 3). Results have just been published to the effect that NibpyfcdHp possesses excellent chemical stability and durability during the HER process in acid media. It surpasses the previously described polymers in terms of stability and long-term durability at a comparatively low TS of 60 mV dec−1 and an overvoltage of 350 mV (Table 1, line 2). The stability of the catalysts has also been confirmed based on the powder X-ray diffraction and IR spectroscopy data. After 1 week of exposure in 0.5 M H2SO4, no changes were observed in the powder pattern (and in the IR spectra) for NibpyfcdHp, which indicates the extreme stability of Ni-MOF under the selected conditions. CobpyfcdHp was less stable. According to the cyclic voltammetry (CV) results, NibpyfcdHp in acidic media (both organic and aqueous) does not change after 10000 cycles. In the CVs of CobpyfcdHp, a slight decrease in the peak current is observed after 2000 scans (Table 1, line 3). The data on the significant stability of the nickel MOF are also confirmed by the invariance of the chronopotentiometric i-t curve of the GC/Ni-MOF/Nafion electrode with a constant current density of 7 mA cm−2 during the 30 hours of electrolysis in 0.5 M H2SO4. An IR spectra analysis of CobpyfcdHp allows for the conclusion that under acidic conditions a 4,4′-bipyridine ligand is lost from the MOF, but the polymeric structure is preserved.68

3D MOFs’ MbpyfcdHp68 are a logical continuation of related structures based on the ferrocenyl diphosphinate linker, 1D MfcdHp.69 The introduction of an additional protonation-capable 4,4′-bpy linker significantly changes the catalytic properties in the HER in organic and aqueous acidic media compared with 1D polymers based on ferrocene-containing diphosphinate (Table 1, lines 4,5).69 For CobpyfcdHp, there is a significant decrease in overvoltage by ∼440 mV in comparison with the CofcdHp polymer in an organic medium and by 50 mV in an aqueous acidic medium.69 The TS changes from 120 to 65 mV dec−1 when moving from a 1D CofcdHp to a 3D CobpyfcdHp structure (Fig. 4), suggesting that the Volmer reaction mechanism changes to the Volmer–Heyrovsky process. Thus, a 4,4′-bpy linker reduces overvoltage and gives more favorable HER kinetics (a lower TS).

The reaction mechanism of the catalytic cycle based on NiI/NiIII reversible transformation was proposed (scheme in Fig. 5).

Although a reasonable choice of a metal ion and an organic linker provides redox activity within the MOF, the redox reaction often changes the coordination environment of metal ions, which leads to the destruction of the framework. One way to overcome these problems is to construct a framework of ligands that are stable in the redox reaction. In this context, ferrocene-based coordination polymers are excellent candidates because they contain a stable ferrocene fragment and two carboxylate, phosphinate or other coordination sites. Bimetallic 3D MOFs’ MbpyfcdHp68 containing a structural unit of ferrocenylphosphonate (redox activity and electrical conductivity) and another metal with an N-containing organic ligand such as 4,4′-bipyridine proved to be very successful catalysts corresponding to the above structural principles. Moreover, the advantage of the phosphonate anionic ligand over the acetate ligand70 is the increased chemical stability and durability of the catalyst, especially when used in strongly acidic conditions. Thus, these new Ni and Co redox-active MOFs based on ferrocenyl diphosphinate and 4,4′-bipyridine linkers demonstrate excellent catalytic properties in the HER and are quite stable catalysts, especially the nickel one, placing it among the most active non-noble metal-based electrocatalytic coordination network materials with long-term durability. Related Zn and Со redox-active coordination polymers based on the ferrocene-containing diphosphinate ligand MfcdHp are also efficient as electrocatalysts for the reduction of protons to hydrogen.69 Complexes Zn(fcdHp) and CofcdHp are isomorphic, crystallizing in the chiral space groups P4122 and P4322, respectively. Using N,N-dimethylformamidium ([DMF(H)+]) as the acid in an acetonitrile solution, Co polymer displays a turnover frequency of 300 s−1, which is among the fastest rates reported for any CP electrocatalyst in CH3CN. This high catalytic rate comes at the cost of an 820–840 mV η10 at the catalytic potential. These electrocatalysts exhibited an η10 of 340 or 450 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, onset potential of 220 or 300 mV, and TS of 110 or 120 mV dec−1, correspondingly for the Zn and Co derivatives, and considerable long-term stability for the HER (Table 1, line 4,5).69 It should be noted that the method of modifying the electrode with an electrocatalytic component, MOF, does not affect the activity of the latter in these cases.69,70 Both the application of catalytic ink with Nafion fixation and the use of a paste electrode gave the same results. Nafion fixation only improves durability, and prevents the destruction of the composite by hydrogen bubbles.
The construction of novel MOFs and the study of the correlation between the electrocatalytic properties and their structural features attract a lot of interest. Jun Zhao reported a 3D 8-fold interpenetrating 66-dia topological Co-MOF based on the 3-(pyrid-4′-yl)-5-(4′′-carbonylphenyl)-1,2,4-triazolyl (H2Pycz) ligand, Co2(Hpycz)4·H2O (Fig. 6).71 The obtained Co-MOF exhibits a good HER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4: it shows a low onset potential of 101 mV, a TS of 121 mV dec−1, an exchange current density of 1.62 × 10−4 A cm−2 and long term stability of at least 72 h (Table 1, line 6).

Ott and colleagues72 report a new MOF, UU-100(Co) (UU = Uppsala University) (Fig. 7), that exclusively consists of cobaloximes, which are widely studied in hydrogen evolution, and which act as metallo-linkers between hexanuclear zirconium clusters. The structure of this MOF, UU-100(Co), was determined by microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED), or more precisely, by the continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) method. When grown on conducting substrates and under an applied reductive potential, the tetranucleating cobaloxime linkers with carboxylate anchors, [Co(dcpgH)(dcpgH2)]Cl2 (Fig. 7), promote electron transport through the film and function as a molecular HER catalyst. The obtained turnover numbers are orders of magnitude higher than those of any other comparable cobaloxime system, and the molecular integrity of the cobaloxime catalysts is maintained for at least 18 h with a constant current density of 1.7 mA cm−2 of electrolysis in NaClO4 (0.1 M)/acetate (0.2 M) buffer at pH 4.72 Post-electrolysis studies show that the molecular integrity of the cobaloxime linkers remains intact.

Being one of the few hydrogen evolving electrocatalytic MOFs based on a redox-active metallo-linker, this work explores little-known terrain for a wide variety of catalyst and charge transport routes.72 UU-100(Co) was grown on glassy carbon (GC) electrodes to study its HER activity. The UU-100(Co)|GC electrodes were prepared under solvothermal conditions on GC that had been functionalized with carboxylic acids by electrochemical diazonium grafting. The PXRD and SEM of the UU-100(Co)|GC electrodes were identical to those of the bulk material, confirming its successful formation.
The catalytic performance of the UU-100(Co)|GC electrodes showed the evolution of a catalytic wave with an early onset potential of ∼−0.15 V vs. RHE (Table 1, line 7). The Tafel analysis of the LSV data gave a TS of 250 mV dec−1 and an exchange current density of ∼10−4.2 A cm−2. The controlled potential electrolysis of the UU-100(Co)|GC electrodes in NaClO4 (0.1 M)/acetate (0.2 M) buffer at pH 4 and at an applied potential of −0.45 V vs. RHE consumes 29C cm−2 charge over 5 h at a stable current density of ∼1.7 mA cm−2 with a faradaic yield of 84%. This corresponds to a turnover number (TONCo) of 8250 based on the amount of electroactive cobalt in the film, with an average formal turnover frequency (TOFCo) of 1650 h−1. The MOF films show high durability as demonstrated by their sustained activity over the course of 18 h of electrolysis at pH 4.72
The cobaloxime linkers are coordination compounds, and as the crystallinity and morphology of UU-100(Co) are preserved during electrolysis, the linkers must have remained intact. The performance of UU-100(Co)|GC is vastly superior to that of the most efficient electrocatalytic materials with analogous molecular cobaloxime catalysts. The molecular cobaloxime linker itself displayed a TON of 10 under homogeneous conditions and 2 h of electrolysis in mildly acidic aqueous solution. These TONs are substantially lower than the TONCo observed for UU-100(Co) (more than 20000) which highlights the stabilization of the cobaloxime core provided by the rigid 3D architecture of the framework. In comparison with the only other electrocatalytic MOF for hydrogen evolution, (Hf12-CoDBP/CNT), UU-100(Co) displays a slower rate but operates under milder conditions (pH 4 versus pH 0) and without any Nafion binder to maintain stable current densities.72
This result illustrates that structurally fragile molecular catalysts can be stabilized by MOF incorporation so that they can be used as electrocatalysts for a long time. The obtained TONs are orders of magnitude higher than those of any other related system that utilizes similar cobaloxime catalysts. The other benefits of UU-100(Co) are the following: the high porosity and large internal channels in MOFs allow easy catalyst access, and the spatial proximity of the redox-active metallo-linkers promotes high electron hopping rates.72
Through the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) method, a 2D Ni-based supramolecular polymer single-layer sheet (H3[NiIII3(tht)2]) (tht = 1,2,5,6,9,10-triphenylenehexathiol) with a thickness of 0.7–0.9 nm was synthesized by Feng et al.73 This 2DMOF nanosheet shows remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the HER, with a TS of 80.5 mV dec−1 and an onset potential of 110 mV (Table 1, line 8, Fig. 8), which are superior to those of reported carbon nanotube (CNT)-supported molecular catalysts and heteroatom-doped graphene catalysts. The TS suggests that initial proton adsorption, that is, a Volmer reaction, is the rate determining step of the HER. The high degree of complexation between Ni and thiol groups plays a key role in the robust coupling of the THT monomers. The THTNi 2DSP sheets composed of nickel bis(dithiolene) can function as HER catalysts over a wide pH range.

Feng's team developed this successfully and immobilized the molecular MSxNy (M = Co and Ni, x/y are 2/2, 0/4, and 4/0, respectively) complexes into two-dimensional metal–organic frameworks (2D MOFs) based on metal dithiolene–diamine coordination (THTA-M) with three forms, including the single-layer nanosheets by “bottom-up” interfacial synthesis, MOF powders (MOF-p) and MOF/graphene (MOF/G) composites by the hydrothermal method.74 Three possible molecular centers—CoS2N2, CoS4, and CoN4—coexist in the hexagonal networks of 2D MOFs prepared by the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) method to achieve the single-layer nanosheets (Fig. 9).

The electrocatalytic performance of the 2D MOF sheets for the HER was evaluated in 0.5 M H2SO4.74 For the THAT-Co H2 evolution that occurred with an η10 of 92 mV, the operating potential at 10 mA cm−2 was determined to be 283 mV, and the TS was 71 mV decade−1 (Table 1, line 9), suggesting that the desorption of H radicals to form H2 is the rate-determining step in the HER process. Stability, however, was not very high, relative to the other examples, and after 300 cycles a current drop was observed.74 In order to enhance the HER performance, the composites of 2D MOFs and graphene were prepared.
Although the immobilization of molecular catalysts onto carbon supports can increase electrical conductivity, enhance catalytic activity, and improve structural stability, the results for G/THTA-Co were almost the same as without graphene, and even slightly better, with only increased stability ((Table 1, line 10).
For the single-layer THTA-Ni 2D MOFs containing molecular NiS2N2 complexes, the electrochemical characteristics are slightly worse than the catalytic performance of THTA-Co 2D MOFs (Table 1, line 11). The electrocatalytic HER performance of the 2D MOF-based catalysts with different metal complexes follows by the order of MS2N2 > MN4 > MS4. It was proposed that the protonation preferentially occurs on the metal atoms and the concomitant heterolytic elimination of H2 is favored on the M-N units in the MS2N2 active centers.
2D MOFs possessing active sites similar to transition-metal dichalcogenides were also found to be highly efficient HER catalysts.75 Clough et al. reported high HER performances of 2D MOFs H3[CoIII3(bht)2], bht = benzenehexathiolate (C6S6Na6) (MOS-1) and H3[CoIII3(tht)2], tht = triphenylene-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexathiolate (MOS-2) (Fig. 10).75 MOS-2 is isostructural with MOS-1 but possesses larger pores. These MOFs are honeycomb-like 2D sheets constructed from 2-connected metal ions with square planar coordination geometry and 3-connected organic ligands with tris-chelating coordination geometry. Thin films of the MOFs with thicknesses of 360 nm were coated on the GC electrode. In H2SO4 solution, the MOS-1 and MOS-2 electrodes gave a η10 of 340 mV and 530 mV, respectively (Table 1, line 12 and 13). CPE modified by MOS-1 was performed at −0.72 V for 2 h in 0.1 M NaClO4 citrate/phosphate buffer (pH = 2.6), and the FE was 97%. After a 10 h CPE at −0.47 V, the current density decreased about 75%, which was attributed to the peeling-off effect of the H2 bubbles. Thus, the successful integration of the cobalt dithiolene catalysts into MOS to give very active electrocatalytic cathode materials for hydrogen generation from fully aqueous solutions was demonstrated.75 This generated material displayed high catalyst loadings and stability under acidic conditions although it was inferior to many of the above catalysts (Table 1).

Xianhui Bu's group reported two new polymorphic Co-MOFs (CTGU-5 and -6) from Co(ClO4)2·6H2O, naphthalene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid(L), 1,4-bis(imidazol)butane(bib) in PEG-400 or aqueous media.77 These C-MOFs can be selectively crystallized into a pure 2D or 3D net using an anionic or neutral surfactant, respectively (Fig. 11 and Table 1, line 14).77 Experimental and computational studies find that 2D CTGU-5 which has coordinate water and more open access to the Co site has a higher electrocatalytic activity than CTGU-6 which has lattice water. The addition of acetylene black (AB) leads to a composite material, AB&CTGU-5 (1:4), with very efficient HER catalytic properties. It exhibits superior HER properties including a very positive onset potential of 18 mV, low TS of 45 mV dec−1, higher exchange current density of 8.6 × 10−4 A cm−2, and long-term stability (Table 1, line 15).

The long-term stability of AB&CTGU-5 (1:4) shows very limited deterioration of cathodic currents for 96 h. The strong performance could be due to a unique scaffolding structure of the 2D CTGU-5 layers and acetylene black, leading to the outstanding catalytic activity of AB&CTGU-5. When acetylene black (AB) was replaced by graphene, the onset potentials also decreased (Table 1, line 16), compared with the pure CoII MOFs. With graphene (6 wt%) in CTGU-5, the composite catalyst exhibits an optimal HER activity, with a low onset potential of 23 mV and a TS of 88 mV dec−1. These results demonstrate that the HER activity of the authors’ MOFs-based composites benefits from the synergistic effect between Co-MOFs materials and conducting cocatalysts. Remarkably, the exchange current density of AB&CTGU-5 (1:4) (8.6 × 10–4 A cm−2) is noticeably larger than that of the commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst (1.7 × 10−4 A cm−2).77
3D isostructural MOFs, [M(ddbp)0.5(4,4′-bipy)0.5(H2O)2](M = Co/Ni, H4ddbp = 1,3-di(3′,5′-dicarboxylphenyl)benzene, 4,4′-bipy = 4,4-bipyridine) with four-fold polyrotaxane-like networks show satisfactory activity in the HER.78 Co-MOF has better HER performance with a smaller η10 of 357 mV at 10 mA cm−2, lower TS of 107 mV dec−1 and good durability for 96 h (Table 1, line 17).
Hf12-CoDBP, consisting of Co-metalated 5,15-di(p-benzoato)-porphyrin (CoDBP) bridging ligands, is a Hf12-porphyrin metal-organic framework that appears as a HER electrocatalyst79 (Fig. 12). Covalent tethering of Hf12-CoDBP to multi-walled carbon nanotubes significantly improved electrical conductivity, leading to a drastically enhanced HER turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) for the Hf12-CoDBP/CNT hybrid. The Hf12-CoDBP/CNT assembly afforded a turnover number of 32000 in 30 minutes with a turnover frequency of 17.7 s−1, placing it among the most functional Co-based electrocatalysts (Table 1, line 18).79 Hf12-CoDBP/CNT greatly outperformed Hf12-CoDBP and Hf12-CoDBP/non-carboxylated CNT in the electrocatalytic HER in aqueous media. Dropcasted Hf12-CoDBP/CNT exhibited a remarkable electrocatalytic HER activity in a pH = 1 HClO4 solution, with an η10 of 650 mV. This corresponds to a TS of 178 mV dec−1, which is consistent with a rate limiting step involving the adsorption of a proton to the catalytic site within the Volmer portion of the HER. The importance of the CNT tethering was further supported by the increased current densities, TONs, and FEs for the Hf12-CoDBP/CNT samples with higher CNT loadings. Nevertheless, the faradaic efficiency is low, about 30%. However, long term stability of the Hf12-CoDBP/CNT system remained an issue as stirring and hydrogen bubble formation tended to shear the catalyst off the electrode surface.79

2D MOF crystals of Cu6(C8H4O4)6(H2O)6·H3[P(W3O10)4] with large lateral size were directly grown on the surface of graphene or glassy carbon through the optimized graphene-templated epitaxial growth.80 This strongly coupled 2D MOF/graphene material possesses topological superiorities and exhibits a notably enhanced electrocatalytic performance (Table 1, line 19, Fig. 13) compared with MOFs prepared by liquid exfoliation and 2D MOFs physically coupled with an additional conductive network.80 The 2D MOF loaded electrode displays an η10 of 0.66 V but the pure bulk MOF is HER inert. Departing from ∼750 mV dec−1 for the bulk in the TS, the 2D nanosheets show only ∼100 mV dec−1, indicating a more favorable catalytic kinetics of the nanosheets.80

Three 2D polyhalogenated isostructural Co-MOFs [Co(X4-pta)(bpy)(H2O)2]n (X4-H2pta = tetrahalogenphthalic acid, X = F, Cl and Br, and bpy = 4,4′-bipyridine) are found with different activities in the HER (Fig. 14).81 Pure Co–Cl4-MOF is distinctly superior to that of pure Co–Br4-MOF and Co–F4-MOF. The addition of acetylene black (AB) can improve the conductivity of pure Co–X4-MOFs, resulting in an enhancement of HER performance for the composites in an acidic medium. Among them, AB&Co–Cl4-MOF(3:4) exhibits the best HER performance owing to its smaller η10 of 283 mV, lower TS of 86 mV dec−1 and a long-term durability with a period of 24 h (Table 1, line 20). The results demonstrate that introducing halogen elements into the MOFs is an efficient strategy for enhanced electrocatalytic HER.81

Polyoxometalate (POM) fragments serve as nodes directly connected with organic ligands that result in three-dimensional 3D open-frameworks, [TBA]3[ε-PMoV8MoVI4O36(OH)4Zn4][BTB]4/3·18H2O (NENU-500, H3BTB = benzene tribenzoate, TBA+ = tetrabutylammonium ion) and [TBA]3[ε-PMoV8MoVI4O37(OH)3Zn4][BPT] (NENU-501, H3BPT = [1,1′-biphenyl]-3,4′,5-tricarboxylic acid).82
These MOFs exhibit good air-stability and tolerance to acid and base media and are employed as electrocatalysts toward the HER owing to the combination of the redox activity of the POM unit and the porosity of the MOF structure (Fig. 15). In 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, NENU-500 displayed a HER electrocatalytic performance with an η10 of 237 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a TS of 96 mV dec−1 (Table 1, line 21). Besides, NENU-501 displayed an η10 of 392 mV and a TS of 137 mV dec−1 in the HER. The electrocatalytic activities of NENU-500 and NENU-501 were both maintained during 2000 cycles. The relatively poor electrocatalytic activity of NENU-501 is attributed to its almost pore-free structure, which may lead to the difficulty of removing the cationic ligands (TBA+) from the relatively small pores. The HER activities of ε(trim)4/3, NENU-5 and HKUST-1 were also studied for comparison. It is interesting to note that the 3D structure with large channels and a high surface area of NENU-500 favors such activity in acidic electrolytes.82

It is often noted that the intrinsic electrical conductivity of most MOFs is poor and the big challenge is to improve it by more successfully applying to the electrode and using additional conductive components. Copper- and H3BTC (1,3,5-trimesic acid) based metal–organic frameworks (HKUST-1) have been electrodeposited onto carbon paper directly.83
These electrochemically prepared (EP) HKUST-1@carbon paper hybrids exhibited significantly improved electrocatalytic performances for the HER, including a positively shifted onset potential, lower η10 and smaller TS, compared to the conventional hydrothermally (HT) prepared HKUST-1. Although these improvements cannot be called fundamental, and the catalytic performance leaves much to be desired with overvoltages of 590 and 660 mV, and TSs of 183.6 and 222.4 mV dec−1, respectively. These characteristics are too large to compete with other MOF-based catalysts (Table 1, line 22).83 Charge transfer resistance (Rct) for HKUST-1 ED (98.4 Ω) is smaller than that for HKUST-1 HT (126.3 Ω). Besides, HKUST-1 ED also gives a smaller Rct (30.9 Ω versus to 66.2 Ω), which means that the electrodeposited MOFs are in better contact with the cathode.83
An electrocatalyst based on conductive material-acetylene black (AB) and a typical 3D Cu-BTC have been prepared by two different strategies (hydrothermal and mechanical grinding strategies).84 A comparison of the results of two different experimental methods shows that the hydrothermal method is more effective than the grinding strategy. The as-prepared composites exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity for the HER with a small η10 of 208 mV and a smaller TS of 80 mV dec−1 (Table 1, line 23, noticeably less than those for a similar Cu-BTC catalyst from ref. 83). More importantly, the long-term stability (18 h) strongly suggests that those kinds of MOF composites could be efficient HER electrocatalysts.
Recently, Jiang's group demonstrated that the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excitation of Au nanorods (NRs) dramatically improves the electrocatalytic activity of CoFe-MOF nanosheets (CoFe-MOFNs) in hydrogen evolution.85 The 2D CoFe-MOFNs have been synthesized from a mixed CoII, FeIII and benzenedicarboxylic acid (BDC) through a simple ultrasonic method. The Au/CoFe-MOFN composite exhibits a much higher HER activity than the pure CoFe-MOFNs and AuNRs with an onset potential of −0.228 V. More than a 4-fold increase of current density at −0.236 V for the Au/CoFe-MOFN composite under light irradiation versus under the dark is seen (Fig. 16). Mechanistic studies reveal that the HER enhancement can be largely attributed to the injection of hot electrons from AuNRs to CoFe-MOFNs, raising the Fermi level of CoFe-MOFNs, facilitating the reduction of H2O and affording decreased activation energy for the HER. This study highlights the superiority of plasmonic excitation upon improving the electrocatalytic efficiency of MOFs and provides a new way for the design of highly efficient water-splitting systems under light irradiation. When irradiated with an 808 nm laser (the maximum LSPR absorption of AuNRs), the HER activity of the Au/CoFe-MOFNs is considerably enhanced, yielding a much lower onset potential (ca. −0.135 V) and a much higher current increase rate than that in the dark. It can be seen that the Au/CoFe-MOFNs show a TS of 115 mV dec−1 in the dark. But after an 808 nm laser irradiation, the TS of the Au/CoFe-MOFNs decreases to 94 mV dec−1, the overpotential at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 decreases from 228 to 135 mV (Table 1, line 24) and the current density realizes an approximately 4-fold (at −0.236 V) enhancement.85 To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report on the integration of the plasmonic effect into MOFs for enhanced HER.

A special kind of MOFs is metal–organic nanotubes (MONTs) with well-defined cylindrical nanostructures and having the same advantages of MOFs, such as an open nanoporous structure, large specific surface area, and crystallinity. These structural features make MONTs promising non-noble-metal-based catalysts toward the HER, but there are few successful examples.86–88 It is difficult to purposefully construct MONTs, as doing so requires an accurate control of the growing direction of the coordination bonds, and also, these structures are thermodynamically less stable and kinetically more difficult when it comes to obtaining the extended 2D or 3D lattices. Zhang et al.86 synthesized the polyoxometalate (POM)-encapsulated metal−organic nanotube (MONT) framework crystalline materials with copper-mixed ligands, HUST-200 and HUST-201 (Fig. 17). Copper ions connected by a multidentate ligand as 5-(2-pyrazinyl)tetrazole (pzta), generating squares or hexagons that can be linked (via their vertex) by a second organic rigid ligand as 4,4′-bipyridine (bpy) form porous nanotubular frameworks.

The encapsulation not only provides a shield to increase the chemical stability, but also does not affect its catalytic activity, and, therefore, the crystalline materials are very active for the HER (H+ can diffuse easily through the pores of the MONTs). Thus, HUST-200 displays a low η10 of 131 mV.86
Both HUST-200- and HUST-201-doped carbon black composite electrodes show high activity toward the HER, especially HUST-200, that is, HUST-200 had an η10 of 131 mV (Table 1, line 25). Cu/ptza/bpy has the poorest HER performance because it is difficult to obtain 3D coordination networks without POMs as the templates. As is well known, POMs could be used as outstanding electrocatalysts, because they possess multistep electron and proton transfer and/or storage abilities.39,82,89 Nevertheless, their heterogeneous electrocatalytic activity is limited because of their high solubility and low surface area. Using POMs as a template and inserting them into the cavities of MOFs to form POMOFs may induce a huge enhancement of electrocatalytic actions because MOFs possess a large specific surface area, an ordered porous structure, tunable space structures, and crystallinity, and, very importantly, the resulting POMOFs are insoluble. Thus, the encapsulation of POMs into a 3D framework shows a synergistic growth of activity and overcomes the disadvantages of the POMs alone. HUST-200 and HUST-201 exhibit TSs of 51 and 79 mV dec−1, respectively. This HER process can be assigned to the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism. The TSs of HUST-200 and HUST-201 are lower than those of some excellent above mentioned reported (POM-)MOF-based HER catalysts, NENU-500 and NENU-50182 (Table 1, line 21), HKUST-1 (ref. 83) (Table 1, line 22), or ε(trim)4/3.82 The encapsulation provides a shield to increase the chemical stability (up to very acidic pH media).86 The catalytic activity of HUST-200 is one of the highest compared to those of the other MOF and POMOF electrocatalysts (Table 1).
To summarize, in the last few years, significant progress has been made in the direction of improving the electrocatalytic performance of MOFs in the HER, by engineering the ligands and coordination modes to boost electrolyte tolerance, constructing 3D or 2D nanoarchitectures, or combining with conductive components to increase conductivity, further optimizing the composition, morphology and structure to expose highly active catalytic sites. From the authors’ point of view, the best catalysts are shown in Fig. 19. It is noteworthy that although nickel pristine MOF-based electrocatalysts are less common than their cobalt counterparts and the latter holds the top position quantitatively, among the four leaders in terms of characteristics, two are nickel-based, one is cobalt- and one is copper-based MOF (Table 1 and Fig. 18). In addition to kinetic and thermodynamic advantages, nickel-based MOFs are also characterized by high stability and durability.

4. Bifunctional MOF-based electrocatalysts for water splitting
Electrocatalytic water electrolysis or water splitting, the reverse process of fuel cell reactions, consists of the catalysis of H2 evolution at the cathode and O2 evolution at the anode. Theoretically, the energy supply under standard conditions is 237 kJ mol−1 (1.23 V), but in practice, the required energy is much higher due to the slow kinetics associated with multiple electron transfers with bond rearrangements. As already mentioned, traditionally Pt was by far the best element for the HER, but RuO2 and IrO2 were the best electrocatalysts for the OER. At present, available electrocatalysts usually show high OER performance, but worse HER performance in an alkaline solution, while showing superior HER activity, but low OER activity in acidic media. The high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts, which simultaneously catalyze the HER and OER in the same media, can significantly simplify the manufacturing procedures of electrolyzers and equipment necessary to facilitate industrial applications and significantly reduce production costs. Thus, the development and preparation of bifunctional electrocatalysts with excellent activity and at the same time a favorable cost for the overall water splitting is very important, but remains a huge challenge. Earth-abundant metal based catalysts are actively searched for, particularly those based on, or derived from, MOFs. Recently published reviews37,45,47,90–92 on the topic of overall water splitting refer to the publications associated with MOF-derivatives (templates after MOF pyrolysis and so on), presented by the vast scientific majority. Among the bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting based on pristine MOFs cited in this section, some are good catalysts for only one of these two reactions, whereas some others are good catalysts for both reactions.
There are few examples of electrocatalysts based on pristine MOF or MOF-carbon composites showing good performance as a bi- or more rarely tri-functional catalyst in three important electrocatalysis reactions, namely, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).
Cu-MOF created by Loh’ group via linking copper nitrate, 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid and triethylene-diamine produces the 3D framework.87 Based on this Cu-MOF, the GO-incorporated composite (Fig. 19) displayed good performance as a trifunctional catalyst for the HER, ORR and OER in 0.5 M H2SO4.87 One of the challenges in the area of electrocatalysis is to find an effective catalyst that will reduce, as well as generate, oxygen at moderate temperatures. The onset potential for the HER was 202 mV for Cu-MOF and decreased from 123 to 87 mV as the GO amount increased from 2 to 8 wt%. For the OER, the TS was 65 mV dec−1 for (GO 8 wt%) Cu-MOF and 89 for Cu-MOF (Table 2, line 1). The enhanced electrocatalytic properties and stability in the acid of the GO-MOF composite are due to the porous scaffold structure, improved charge transport and synergistic interactions between the GO and the MOF.

The ORR electron number is close to 4, between −0.1 and −0.4 V for (GO 8 wt%) Cu-MOF, but about between 2 and 4 for Cu-MOF over the same potential range. Oxygen reduction occurs through different mechanisms in low and high current density regions. In the low current density region, the TS for (GO 8 wt%) Cu-MOF is 69 mV dec−1 (Temkin-type adsorption,) while in the high current density region, the slope is 132 mV dec−1 (Langmuir adsorption).87 In polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell testing, the GO-incorporated Cu-MOF composite delivers a power density that is 76% that of the commercial Pt catalyst.87
Overall water-splitting electrocatalysts based on 2D CoNi bimetallic organic frameworks (CoNi-MOFs) with the 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate organic linker directly grown as a nanoplate array on a copper foil under hydrothermal conditions were proposed.93 Such CoNi-MOFs (Co:Ni = 1:1) demonstrate highly active OER catalysis, as manifested by a small overpotential of 265 mV and TS of 56 mV dec−1 in alkaline media. This MOF catalyzes the HER with a compatible overpotential of 120 mV and excellent stability.
The overall water splitting using these 2D CoNi-MOF-based catalysts shows a 99% faradaic efficiency at 1.64 V, suggesting a promising pathway forward for the commercial realization of complete water-splitting systems.93
A strategy for the in situ growth of ultrathin nanosheet arrays of 2D MOFs on various supports was developed.94 The integrated MOF electrodes demonstrate excellent performances towards the OER, HER and overall water splitting. The material was prepared via a one-step chemical bath deposition method by adding the organic ligand (2,6-naphthalene-dicarboxylic acid dipotassium) into an aqueous solution of metal salt (nickel acetate and iron nitrate) in the presence of the substrate. The crystal structure of the MOF consists of alternating organic hydrocarbon (2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic group) and inorganic metal–oxygen-layers (MO6 units; M = Ni, Fe or Cu) with the 2D sheet-array morphology (Fig. 20).
 Fig. 20  Synthesis of the MOF nanosheet array.93 
Thus, the fabricated nickel-iron-based MOF array demonstrates superior electrocatalytic performance towards the oxygen evolution reaction with a small overpotential of 240 mV and TS of 34 mV dec−1, and the turnover frequency of the electrode is 3.8 s−1 at an overpotential of 400 mV (Table 2, line 3).
Interestingly, the best characteristics, in some ways are even superior to those of noble catalysts, were obtained precisely with the ultrathin nanosheet array NiFe-MOF, and not with calcined NiFe-MOF (650 °C for 6 h in N2). The faradaic efficiency was 95%, both indicating that the OER follows a four-electron pathway to generate oxygen molecules. Remarkably, the NiFe-MOF electrode showed excellent stability as confirmed by a prolonged chronoamperometric i–t test (20 h) and cyclic voltammetry (1000 cycles).94 The electrolytic cell demonstrated excellent catalytic activity and can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a voltage only of 1.55 V, which is 70 mV lower than that using the precious metal-based Pt/C cathodes and IrO2 anodes. The TS of NiFe-MOF (256 mV dec−1) is also lower than the Pt/C cathode and IrO2 anode system (267 mV dec−1). To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this NiFe-MOF is one of the best bifunctional electrocatalysts reported for full water splitting. The significantly enhanced performance of the NiFe-MOF catalyst is attributable to its optimal structural characteristics for electrocatalysis including highly exposed molecular metal active sites owing to ultrathin MOF sheets, and improved electrical conductivity through 2D nanostructuration, with a hierarchical porosity. In contrast to the NiFe metal oxides/hydroxides with limited exposed metal active sites, the MOF has inherent molecular metal centres, as potential active sites for electrocatalysis. The direct use of the MOF as an electrocatalyst can provide enormous molecular metal sites as catalytic centres and these sites can also be highly exposed to electrolyte ions for use in catalytic reactions. Highly hydrophilic MOF nanosheets facilitate the adsorption of water onto the electrode surface and promote the kinetics of water dissociation.94
Highly efficient and stable bifunctional bimetallic metal MOF based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting at high current densities were developed through an appropriate modulation of the composition of two metals.95 This MOF, FeNi(BDC)(DMF,F) was in situ grown into conductive, macroporous nickel foam to realize unique hierarchical synergistic effects, such as heterogeneous, intermolecular, and intramolecular ones (Fig. 21). This bifunctional catalyst was able to achieve current densities of 10 and 400 mA cm−2 at ultralow cell voltages of 1.58 and 1.90 V (Table 2, line 4), respectively, outperforming the pairing of the benchmark electrodes, Pt–C//IrO2.95 The stability of the electrodes was also excellent, with only a minor chronoamperometric decay after a continuous operation at 400 mA cm−2 for 30 h. The MOF/NF electrode of Fe:Ni of 5:1 shows the highest TOF value, lowest overpotentials, TS, and charge transfer resistance. This success may be attributed to the MOF/substrate synergistic effects between FeNi(BDC)(DMF,F) and the conductive macroporous nickel foam, the inter-molecular synergistic effects between the two constituent MOF phases, and the intra-molecular synergistic effects between the FeO6 and NiO6 clusters of the Fe-rich FeNi(BDC)(DMF,F).95

A mixed-metal Co/Cu-MOF based on 4,4′-di(ethoxy)biphenyl-3,3′,5,5′-tetra-(phenyl-4-carboxylic acid linker has been prepared and has demonstrated enhanced electrocatalytic performances compared to that of monometallic MOF.96 Pristine Co/Cu-MOF shows significantly improved performances for the HER with an overpotential of 391 mV (10 mA cm−2 current density), low TS of 94 mV dec−1 and long-term operation stability (14 h) (Table 2, line 5). More importantly, the direct utilization of this MOF for accelerating the OER also presents a fascinating performance in terms of overpotential at a 10 mA cm−2 current and durability.
To circumvent the shortcomings of poor electrical conductivity and low accessibility of active metal centers blocked by organic ligands in MOFs, ultrathinning bulk MOFs into 2D layered nanosheets has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy.94,97 Recently, the Renbing Wu group showed that in comparison with traditional bulk MOFs, 2D MOF nanosheets not only ensure easy mass transport of molecules or ions and activate electron transfer, but also have a larger specific surface area and higher percentage of surface coordinatively unsaturated and more exposure of active sites, thus leading to an improved electrocatalytic performance (Fig. 22).97

Ultrathin Ni-ZIF/Ni-B nanosheets with abundant crystalline–amorphous phase boundaries via a controlled room-temperature boronization of Ni-ZIF (nickel zeolite imidazolate framework) nanorods have been developed. The optimized Ni-ZIF/Ni–B nanosheets supported on nickel foam required a small overpotential of 234 and 67 mV to drive the OER and HER processes at 10 mA cm−2, respectively (Table 2, line 6).
The Ni-ZIF/Ni–B nanosheets supported on nickel foam obtained by a 4 h boronization of Ni-ZIF exhibited an exceptional electrocatalytic performance toward the overall water splitting with an ultralow cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm−2, thus representing a new level for MOF-based electrocatalysts.97
Several recent advances in the field of exclusively oxygen evolution catalysts should be noted. A series of stable MOFs (CTGU-10a1−d1) based on trinuclear metal carboxylate clusters and a hexadentate carboxylate ligand with a (6,6)-connected nia network have been synthesized.98 A strategy to synthesize hierarchical bimetallic MOF nanostructures (CTGU-10a2−d2) was shown. Among these catalysts, CTGU-10c2 is the best material for the OER, with an η10 of 240 mV and a TS of 58 mV dec−1, and is one of the few known high-performing pure-phase MOF-OER electrocatalysts. Notably, bimetallic CTGU-10b2 and c2 show an improved OER activity over their monometallic counterparts. DFT and experiments show that the remarkable OER performance of CTGU-10c2 is due to the presence of unsaturated metal sites, a hierarchical nanobelt architecture, and the Ni–Co coupling effect.98
A new alkaline-stable 3D Ni-MOF, containing a 1D rod-packing chain structure fused with a tetranuclear nickel cluster [Ni4(μ3-OH)2], was used as a target material to explore its OER properties.99 The electrocatalytic activities of pure Ni-MOF and hybrid materials made from Ni-MOF with different AB loaded electrodes, such as glassy carbon, fluorine-doped tin oxide, and nickel foam (NF), have been evaluated. The enhanced OER performance might be attributed to the synergistic interactions of two catalytic active species between in situ formed β-Ni(OH)2 and a tetranuclear Ni4(μ3-OH)2 cluster in Ni-MOF. The optimized AB&Ni-MOF(1:1)/NF electrode attains a high-efficiency catalytic OER performance with a smaller Tafel slope of 65 mV dec−1, an overpotential of 263 mV, and catalytic durability within the limited time (12 h). These findings will shed new light on the fabrication of MOF-derived catalysts.99
Metal–organic framework-derived nanocomposites and other MOF derivatives for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction or overall water splitting have been analyzed in detail and summarized in recent reviews37,45,47,50,76,90–92 and therefore will not be considered here.
5. Conclusions
Electrochemical overall water splitting and hydrogen evolution reactions are actively investigated as a prospective strategy to produce hydrogen. Considering emerging catalysts, MOF-based structures have attracted much attention and are being widely studied. In this review, electrocatalysts based on pristine or intact MOFs from the past few years have been summarized. For MOFs, real progress has been achieved in the direction of improving their electrocatalytic performance by engineering the ligands and coordination modes for increasing electrolyte tolerance and constructing 2D nanosheets or combining MOFs with conductive materials, thus optimizing the composition, morphology and structure to expose highly active catalytic sites.
It is interesting to compare the results of the catalytic activity studies of MOF-derivatives (after pyrolysis, calcination, carbonization and phosphidation, and so on) and pristine MOF published in recent years. Thus, a summary of the bifunctional non-noble MOF-derived catalysts for electrocatalytic overall water splitting47,90,92 shows that they are characterized by the following values: Tafel slope (TS) for the HER 38–173 mV dec−1, for the OER 44–97 mV dec−1; overpotential η10 for the HER 98–370 mV, for the OER 190–476 mV; Vcell 1.49–2.0 V, stability test 5–50 h or 1000–5000 cycles. However, the bifunctional pristine MOF catalysts show the following values: Tafel slope (TS) for the HER 84–256 mV dec−1, for the OER 34–94 mV dec−1; overpotential η10 for the HER 67–391 and for the OER 227–1540 mV; Vcell 1.54–1.64 V, stability test 4–30 h (Table 2).
Obviously, the best representatives of pristine MOFs are not only inferior to those of MOF-derivatives, but they are superior in some cases, for example, they have lower TS values for the OER and a lower HER overvoltage of water splitting. Moreover, VCell and the stability test can be called comparable. The electrolytic cells with the MOF-modified electrodes demonstrated excellent catalytic activity and could deliver a high current density (10 mA cm−2 and higher) at a voltage lower than that using the precious metal-based Pt/C cathodes and IrO2 anodes.
While the published summary data on the catalytic performance of non-noble MOF-derived nanoparticles in the HER taken from recent reviews90,92 is analyzed, the following results are obtained: Tafel slope (TS) 31.3–138 mV dec−1; overpotential η10 41–350 mV; stability test 1.4–30 h or 1000–10000 cycles. However, catalysts based on intact MOFs show the following values: Tafel slope (TS) 45–250 mV dec−1; overpotential η10 44–660 mV; stability test 4–96 h or up to 10000 cycles (Table 1). As a result, these characteristics are comparable for all indicators.
Nevertheless, the transformation of crystalline organometallic frameworks into metal-compound/carbon hybrid nanocomposites by pyrolysis is considered a successful method for developing more superior electrocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting or the HER. However, MOF pyrolysis or high-temperature annealing usually involves a complex high-temperature treatment that can destroy the unique structures and intrinsic active sites, and the coordinated environment inside the MOF and, as a result, does not fully utilize their properties during electrolysis. Therefore, a MOF-derived catalyst is not necessarily better than that of a pristine MOF.
Due to their unique characteristics such as high specific surface area, high porosity, tunable pore structures, and elemental compositions, MOFs have attracted tremendous interest in various fields, especially in the field of electrocatalysis. Improved conductivity for adequate electron transfer is ensured by the addition of acetylene black, graphene/graphene oxide materials and/or CNTs. Exfoliation or ultra-thinning of bulk MOFs into 2D layered metal−organic nanosheet electrocatalysts is also an efficient method.
For pristine MOFs, metal centers or heteroatoms of ligands are considered as the active sites for catalytic reactions. The activity of catalytic particles can be increased by introducing organic redox-active ligands with additional basic centers (N, S, etc.) (for example, porphyrin and bipyridine ligands) or by functionalizing ligands by electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents. The stability of MOFs is determined by various factors, and the discovered fact of the increased stability of phosphonate structures in comparison with their carboxylate counterparts, for example, has not yet been fully exploited. Bimetallic MOFs containing a redox-active ferrocenyl phosphonate structural unit and another metal with a nitrogen-containing organic ligand (additional basic centers may introduce structural flexibility into the whole framework and facilitate the proton transfers) seem especially attractive for research in this regard. It is obvious that further mechanistic studies and DFT calculations are still necessary for realizing optimized catalyst design.
Although significant breakthroughs have been made, there is still a long way to go for developing MOF-based electrocatalysts before they can be scaled up to commercial applications for hydrogen production.
The number of MOFs is large, but only a few of them have been used for the preparation of electrocatalysts towards water electrolysis and the HER. However, the large-scale application of MOF-based catalysts is limited by low productivity in most cases, thereby requiring more efficient methods for the mass production of MOF–modified electrodes.
Covalently functionalizing MOFs with conductive polymers (poly(vinylpyrrolidone, etc.) could have very high potential in this regard. This method has been explored for better blending of MOF solids with mixed-matrix membranes.100 It is clear that modifying the structures and surfaces of MOFs is a powerful approach for an accurate adjustment of electrocatalytic properties. A large number of potential applications are beginning to be implemented, as innovative protocols for monitoring the durability of surface and catalytic systems have been developed.
