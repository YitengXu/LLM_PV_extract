    , Accepted 12th March 2019First published on 13th March 2019AbstractSb2Se3 is a promising non-toxic, Earth-abundant, stable thin-film solar cell absorber material. However, the low built-in potential caused by the low intrinsic doping density (∼1013 cm−3) and the low carrier collection efficiency due to the low carrier mobility (∼1.5 cm2 V−1 s−1) hinder further efficiency improvement of Sb2Se3 solar cells. Therefore, an effective hole-transport layer (HTL) is necessary to further boost the built-in potential and assist carrier collection. Herein we attempt to improve the efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells by using CuSCN as an HTL. CuSCN as an HTL suppresses the back surface recombination, and enhances the built-in potential and carrier collection efficiency. Meanwhile, materials and physical properties characterization reveals that CuSCN provides Cu ions which induce grain boundary inversion, and therefore separate photo-generated carriers more efficiently. Consequently, we obtained a device efficiency of 7.50%.
1. Introduction
Traditional Cu(In, Ga)(S, Se)2 (CIGS) and CdTe thin-film solar cells have achieved a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.9% and 22.1%, respectively.1 However, the scarcity of In and Ga and the toxicity of Cd limit their application on a massive scale. As a result, the pursuit of Earth-abundant, inexpensive and non-toxic solar cells has emerged, exploring absorber materials such as Cu2ZnSnS4,2 SnS,3 GeSe,4 CuSbS2,5 CuSbSe2,6 Sb2Se3,7 Sb2S3,8etc. Among them, Sb2Se3 has been developing rapidly9–11 due to its excellent material (simple binary composition and low toxicity of Sb and Se) and optoelectronic properties (a bandgap of 1.1 eV and a high absorption coefficient of 105 cm−1).12,13 Sensitized Sb2Se3 solar cells with the absorber layer fabricated by electrodeposition and spin-coating methods delivered a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.1%14 and 3.21%,15 respectively. In a planar configuration, different methods16–18 and different buffer layers19–21 have been employed to construct Sb2Se3 solar cells. Sb2Se3 solar cells with a sprayed ZnO buffer layer demonstrated a certified PCE of 5.93% and outstanding stability.22 Then, Sb2Se3 deposited by the vapor transfer deposition (VTD) method obtained a certified efficiency of 7.6% based on a superstrate structure23 and demonstrated super-flexible properties.24 Moreover, substrate configuration Sb2Se3 solar cells were fabricated on the Mo substrate using the Close-Spaced Sublimation (CSS) method and obtained a PCE of 9.2% through fabricating core–shell structured Sb2Se3 nano-rod arrays.25 Such rapid development demonstrates the huge potential of Sb2Se3 solar cells.
However, the low doping density (∼1013 cm−3, even lower than CdTe, 1014 cm−3) of the Sb2Se3 layer has been reported to be the main reason for the low built-in potential.13 Because of the peculiar one-dimensional Sb2Se3 crystal structure, neither extrinsic nor intrinsic doping has been successful in increasing free carrier concentration. To circumvent this problem, an n–i–p device architecture is constructed using the Sb2Se3 film as the i-layer. A PbS colloidal quantum dot (CQD) and organic materials have been successfully applied in n–i–p Sb2Se3 solar cells as the hole-transporting layer (HTL) and achieved a PCE of 6.5%26 and 6.84%,27 respectively. However, the toxicity of Pb and instability of organic materials are still the issues to be solved. Recently, CuCl2 treatment was reported to cause grain boundary (GB) inversion and lead to increased carrier collection efficiency boosting the PCE of Sb2Se3 solar cells to 7.04%.28 Encouraged by these results, we thus selected CuSCN as the HTL in the hope that it could combine the inversion of GBs and benefits of the HTL to further enhance the performance. Notably, CuSCN, being a stable and low-cost HTL widely employed in dye-sensitized29,30 and perovskite solar cells,31 has not been explored in Sb2Se3 solar cells.
In this paper, we employ CuSCN as the HTL to improve the performance of Sb2Se3 solar cells. The CuSCN deposited on ITO/CdS/Sb2Se3 films acts as a source of Cu ion diffusion into Sb2Se3 films and causes GB inversion, which separates the photo-generated electrons and holes spatially and suppresses the recombination at GBs. Meanwhile, the Cu vacancy (VCu) forming in CuSCN films after Cu diffusion increases the doping density of CuSCN, which strengthens the electric field in the back surface and promotes the selective and efficient collection of photo-generated holes. Finally, an efficiency of 7.50% was obtained with enhanced short-circuit current density (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC). We believe that this method is generally applicable to other solar cells based on low-dimensional materials such as Sb2S3, GeSe, CuSbS2, and CuSbSe2.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Sb2Se3 solar cell fabrication
All solar cells were deposited on ITO transparent conductive glass supplied by Kaivo, which had been cleaned using detergent, acetone, isopropanol, ethanol and deionized water in sequence. The sheet resistance and transmittance of the ITO substrates are 6.5–7 ohm sq−1 and 75–80%, respectively. 60–70 nm thick CdS buffer layer was deposited by chemical bath deposition on ITO according to the previous report.23 Then the CdS layer was treated with H2O2 (30 wt%) and CdCl2 methanol solution (0.2 M) via a spin-coating process following an annealing process at 400 °C for 5 min in air. The Sb2Se3 layer was deposited by a standard VTD process using a single temperature zone tube furnace (MTI, Hefei, China) via evaporating Sb2Se3 powder (99.999% purity, Jiangxi Ketai). The ITO/CdS substrates were supported by graphite and placed at the edge of VTD. The Sb2Se3 source was heated to 540 °C at a ramp rate of 20 °C min−1 and kept for 2 min to deposit 1000 nm thick Sb2Se3 film. Please note that the chamber pressure was stabilized at 3 Pa during the whole deposition process. For the HTL, CuSCN (99% purity, Aladdin) was dissolved in dipropyl sulfide solution (99% purity, Aladdin) with different concentrations (3 mg mL−1, 6 mg mL−1, 12 mg mL−1 and 24 mg mL−1) and stirred for 2 hours at 80 °C in a glovebox to obtain a clear and transparent solution. Then 30 μL of the CuSCN precursor was dropped onto the Sb2Se3 films spinning at 3000 rpm to deposit a thin and uniform film, and the substrate was allowed to spin for 30 seconds. Subsequent thermal treatment was carried out by placing the samples on a hot plate at 85 °C for 10 min. Au electrodes (0.09 cm2) were deposited using an electron beam and resistance evaporation thin film deposition system (Beijing Technol Science, Co., Ltd.) under a vacuum pressure of 5 × 10−3 Pa.
2.2 Characterization and measurement

2.2.1 Materials characterization. 
The morphology and cross-sectional images of the Sb2Se3 film were studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Nova NanoSEM450, without Pt coating). Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) measurements (AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W) were carried out in an ultrahigh vacuum photoemission spectroscopy system with He I excitation to evaluate the Fermi level of CuSCN. The optical transmittance of CuSCN was recorded using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Instruments, Lambda 950 using an integrating sphere). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out by applying Al Kα excitation (AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W) to generate the X-ray. X-ray diffraction characterization (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation (Philips, X pert pro-MRD) was performed on the CuSCN film to verify the phase and orientation. A LabRAM in Via Raman system (Horiba Jobin-Yvon, LabRAM HR800) was applied for CuSCN powder and films, and unpolarized light was generated through a 325 nm Ar laser. A Quanta 400 FEG FEI microscope equipped with a Smart EBIC (Gatan, Inc.) was used to record SEM and EBIC images. The gold back contact and ITO front contact were connected to the preamplifier using a micromanipulator to obtain voltage–current signals. The electron-beam voltage and working distance were 20 kV and 10.5 mm, respectively. Electron probe microscope analysis (EPMA-8050) was performed to observe the element distribution, especially the Cu in Sb2Se3 films. Atomic Force Microscopy characterization (AFM, SPM9700) was carried out to check the roughness of Sb2Se3 with and without CuSCN as the HTL. The Hall measurement (Ecopia HMS5500, with gold electrodes) of CuSCN was carried out at a temperature of 300 K.


2.2.2 Device characterization. 
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured under simulated AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination from a 450 W xenon light source (Oriel, Model 9119, Newport) with a source meter (Keithley 2400) in air at room temperature. The light intensity was calibrated with a standard Si solar cell (Oriel, Model 91150V, Newport). The delay time, step voltage, and sweep rate were set at 10 ms, 6 mV, and 60 mV s−1, respectively. For external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement, we used a light source generated by a 300 W xenon lamp of Newport (Oriel, 69911) and then split into a specific wavelength using a Newport oriel cornerstone TM 130 1/8 monochromator (Oriel, model 74004). Capacitance–voltage (C–V) was measured with the bias voltage varying from −1.0 V to 0.3 V at room temperature under dark conditions. Moreover, the measurement frequency was 10 kHz and the AC modulation voltage was 30 mV.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Fundamental properties of CuSCN
First, bare thin films of CuSCN were synthesized and their optoelectronic properties were evaluated. The purchased CuSCN powder was dissolved in dipropyl sulfide solution by stirring at 80 °C for 2 hours until a light yellow clear solution was obtained. Then, the precursor was spin-coated on the ITO substrate to get CuSCN films for X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. As shown in Fig. 1a, the diffraction patterns of the CuSCN film fit well with the PDF card (β-CuSCN 00-029-0581, Fig. 1a, bottom) and demonstrate a strong (003) peak. The absence of other XRD peaks indicates that film growth proceeded explicitly perpendicular to the substrate. A strong polarity in Cu–C–N–S chains (Fig. S1†) along the c-axis could be the origin of such preferential growth. This orientation of CuSCN is desirable as the carriers can transport along these chains easily and hence reduce the series resistance of solar cells.

The insets showed the magnified spectra and linear fitting in the range 0.0–2.5 eV. (d) Band diagram of the ITO/CdS/Sb2Se3/CuSCN device. 
Raman spectroscopy was performed to get structural information of CuSCN thin films. CuSCN powder was also characterized as a reference first. As shown in Fig. 1b, the most intensive band in the reference sample was located at 2172 cm−1, which belongs to the characteristic vibration of the CN bond.32 Sharp bands located at 745 cm−1 and 430 cm−1 corresponded to C–S and SCN group vibrations, respectively, which are in accordance with the expected molecular formula S–CN.32 Broad bands observed at 202 and 243 cm−1 are assigned to Cu–N and Cu–S vibrations, confirming that CuSCN powder is a pure phase with the molecular structure of Cu–S–CN.32 The CuSCN film for Raman measurements was obtained via a spin-coating approach on the ITO substrate, and the results are shown in the top of Fig. 1b. The blank ITO substrate was measured to eliminate the influence of the substrate. The peaks at 2172 cm−1 and 243 cm−1 can be detected, but the peaks at 745 cm−1 and 430 cm−1 are buried in the broad background because of their low intensity. Combining all of these results, a CuSCN thin film was obtained by a simple one-step spin-coating method.
To further ascertain the chemical state of the elements in CuSCN films, high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded and are presented in Fig. S2(a–d).† The spectrum of Cu 2p has been fitted with the doublet of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, located at 932.8 eV and 952.7 eV, respectively, which corresponded to the Cu(I) chemical state.33 Core levels of S2p, N1s and C1s corresponded to the chemical states of S2−, N3−, and C4+, and accordingly confirmed the successful fabrication of impurity-free CuSCN thin films.
Optical and electrical properties of CuSCN were further measured. The fresh CuSCN film prepared on ITO was used for ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement to estimate its Fermi level, and the results are shown in Fig. 1c. The Fermi level of the CuSCN film can be calculated by subtracting the cutoff value from an excitation source of 21.2 eV, and the difference between the Fermi level and the valence band maximum (VBM) can be obtained by fitting the tail region of UPS spectra (inset in Fig. 1c). Furthermore, ultraviolet–visible transmission spectra (UV–vis) of CuSCN on soda-lime glass were characterized in the wavelength from 300 to 800 nm to estimate the optical bandgap. As shown in Fig. S3,† the CuSCN is highly transparent in the visible and near-infrared regions and the estimated band gap is 3.55 eV (inset of Fig. S3†). By combining the UPS results and bandgap, we obtain that the Fermi level, VBM, and conduction band minimum (CBM) of CuSCN are 4.80 eV, 5.36 eV, and 1.81 eV, respectively, which are consistent with the reported bandgap (>3.5 eV), VBM (∼5.4 eV) and CBM (1.5–1.8 eV) of CuSCN.30,32 Then the proposed band diagram of ITO/CdS/Sb2Se3/CuSCN is presented in Fig. 1d. Based on this diagram, CuSCN has a large CBM offset and an aligned Fermi level with an absorber, and thus could effectively create a back surface field for electrons and smoothly collect holes and, therefore, is a suitable HTL to form n–i–p structured Sb2Se3 solar cells.
The electrical properties of CuSCN like carrier concentration and mobility are the important parameters that influence the PCE of n–i–p solar cells. The doping density and mobility of CuSCN were reported to be 1018 to 1019 cm−3 and 0.01–0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.34 The CuSCN was spin-coated on a glass substrate for Hall measurement (Ecopia HMS5500, with gold electrodes) at a temperature of 300 K. And the results are summarized in Table S1.† The positive sign of carrier concentration revealed p-type conductivity and a high doping density of ∼1018 cm−3. This, combined with the reasonably high mobility of ∼0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1, revealed that CuSCN is a promising HTL material.
3.2 Device performance
Combining the optical and electrical properties of CuSCN, we see that it is a proper choice for the HTL in Sb2Se3 solar cells. We thus built an n–i–p device which is schematically presented in Fig. 2a. To study the influence of CuSCN thickness on Sb2Se3 solar cell performance, different concentrations of CuSCN in the precursor (3 mg mL−1, 6 mg mL−1, 12 mg mL−1, and 24 mg mL−1) were used to manipulate film thickness, which was calibrated using a step profilometer. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices with different thickness of CuSCN are shown in Fig. 2b. All devices with CuSCN as the HTL presented the improvement in JSC as compared with the control device. We have measured 50 devices and the average performance is summarized in Table 1. Solar cells with 6 mg mL−1 CuSCN showed the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.20%, maintaining VOC, FF and improved JSC. However, when thicker CuSCN was used, the increased series resistance and reduced shunt resistance negatively affected overall device performance.

For simplicity, C-1 and H-1 are defined to represent the device without and with an HTL, respectively. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of C-1 and H-1 were measured to explore the origin of performance improvement (Fig. 2c). Different from our previous PbS quantum dot HTL,26 the wide bandgap CuSCN can't contribute to light absorption; therefore, the obvious EQE improvement in the 650 to 1050 nm range is attributed to the enlarged depletion region width (xd). The depletion region width was estimated by carrying out capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements (Fig. 2d) under dark conditions with a Keithley 4200-SCS. The unchanged capacitance at a reverse bias from −0.6 to −0.1 V indicates that the device was fully depleted.
The built-in voltage, Vbi, was calculated according to the following equation:35 (1)where A is the junction area, NA and ε are the carrier concentration and relative dielectric constant of Sb2Se3 films. The calculated Vbi for H-1 was 0.474 V, which was higher than that for the C-1 device (0.441 V). The 0.033 V enhancement of Vbi explains the origin of marginal VOC improvement in H-1 devices. Assuming an abrupt n+p junction in our CdS/Sb2Se3 device, the calculated xd was 413 nm and 366 nm for H-1and C-1, respectively. The wider xd found in the H-1 device promoted carrier transport through drift, which corresponded in EQE enhancement and finally a JSC increase.
The dark J–V curves (Fig. 2e) were recorded to estimate the recombination dynamics of the C-1 and H-1 devices. The leakage current of H-1 reduced about 3-fold as compared to C-1 devices at a reverse bias of −0.5 V. Simultaneously, the rectification factor of H-1 devices was enhanced from 1506 to 13404 (between −0.5 V and 0.5 V) and the diode quality factor reduced from 1.67 to 1.39. This indicates a higher diode quality of H-1 resulting in a better FF. Meanwhile, we measured the surface roughness of C-1 and H-1 samples using an atomic force microscope (AFM) (Fig. 3a and d). The average roughness of C-1 and H-1 was 82.4 and 71.6 nm, respectively, showing that after CuSCN coating the surface roughness was reduced. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the coverage of CuSCN. As the surface images shown in Fig. 3b and e, a thin CuSCN layer conformally covered the Sb2Se3 grains. Also, the cross-sectional images (Fig. 3c and f) present that CuSCN fills into the concaves between grains, explaining the reduced surface roughness observed in AFM measurements.

To further improve the performance of the devices, subsequent thermal treatment was applied to the device for two reasons. One is to promote the diffusion of Cu from the CuSCN HTL into Sb2Se3 to induce inversion of the grain boundaries, in analogy with our previous CuCl2 treatment.28 The other is that when Cu diffuses into Sb2Se3, more Cu vacancies are expected to form within the CuSCN, thus increasing hole concentration of the HTL as VCu is the source of p-type doping in CuSCN.34 As expected, we obtained a device with a champion PCE of 7.50% after thermal treatment at 85 °C for 10 min. The J–V curves of the device before and after thermal treatment are shown in Fig. 2f, and solar cell parameters are summarized in Table S2.† After thermal treatment, device performance improved mainly because of increased VOC (423 mV versus 412 mV) and JSC (30.8 mA cm−2versus 30.1 mA cm−2).
To confirm our previous hypothesis of the thermal treatment, samples were characterized by TEM and elemental maps were recorded to track diffusion effects. As shown in Fig. 4a–c, the Sb2Se3 layer and CuSCN layer are clearly distinguished by combining the images of High-angle Annular Dark Field (HAADF) and elemental mapping. Moreover, we noticed that a Cu Kα signal (Fig. 4c) was observed in the Sb2Se3 layer, which indicated Cu inter-diffusion. An Electron Probe Micro Analyzer (EPMA) was also employed to estimate the Cu diffusion (shown in Fig. S4†). It is apparent that Se and Sb are concentrated in the Sb2Se3 layer, while the Cu ions distribute not only in the back surface but also in the Sb2Se3 layer. The Cu ion diffusion into Sb2Se3 thin films has been reported to reverse GBs, resulting in enhanced carrier collection through separating photo-generated carriers and suppressing recombination.28 Additionally, XPS was measured before and after annealing treatment to determine the element content in the CuSCN film (Table S3†). The decrease in the Cu 2p peak intensity after annealing suggests that Cu content was reduced in CuSCN as a consequence of Cu out-diffusion.

Further, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) characterization of devices with CuSCN as the HTL were carried out to obtain the information on carrier collection (Fig. 4d, e). Different contrast in the EBIC image indicates different collection efficiencies and the bright area mean regions of high collection efficiency for minority carriers. The SEM and EBIC intensity profiling across a 2 μm line scan (dashed red line marked in Fig. 4d and e) is shown in Fig. 4f, and the black and red arrows mark the GBs of Sb2Se3 in the SEM and EBIC images, respectively. Notably, the GBs always exhibit a higher EBIC intensity than grain interiors (GIs), which means that an efficient current-collecting path was present at GBs. The EBIC results of the devices without CuSCN as the HTL revealed no carrier collection difference between GBs and GIs (Fig. S5†), in accordance with our previous report.7 For the devices without the HTL, the photo-generated holes near CdS and electrons near the Au electrode have to travel a long distance before being collected and thus could recombine during traveling (shown in Fig. 5a). However, when we introduce CuSCN as the HTL, after thermal treatment, Cu ions diffuse into Sb2Se3 films and potentially invert the grain boundaries. The inverse grain boundaries provide extra collection pathways leading to the increased JSC. Additionally, the formation of VCu is promoted in CuSCN films and resulted in increased hole concentration. This creates a strong back surface field, which deflects electrons from the back surface into the bulk resulting in reduced recombination (Fig. 5b). The enhanced p-type doping density in the CuSCN layer and the suppressed non-radiative recombination loss, together account for the observed VOC improvement after thermal annealing.

Last, the stability of our device is evaluated. As shown in Fig. S6,† our devices demonstrated negligible performance degradation when stored in the ambient atmosphere for 121 days without any further protection. Such storage stability is ascribed to the inorganic and stable nature of the CuSCN HTL and the Sb2Se3 absorber.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we used CuSCN as the HTL to construct n–i–p Sb2Se3 solar cells and achieved a power conversion efficiency of 7.50%. The diffusion of Cu in Sb2Se3 is skillfully utilized, which not only inverts the grain boundary but also increases p-type doping in CuSCN, accelerating carrier separation and collection. This innovative method is highly compatible with low-temperature fabrication processes, and could be applied in other solar cells, providing that Cu has a beneficial effect on device performance.
