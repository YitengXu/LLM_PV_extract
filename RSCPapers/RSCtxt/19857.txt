    , Accepted 3rd January 2016First published on 6th January 2016AbstractIn this work we report on the effect of alkali doping via Na and/or K introduction into flexible and light-weight Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) solar cells obtained using a sequential process based on the sputtering of metallic stacks and further reactive annealing. Different thicknesses of Cr diffusion barriers and 50 μm thick ferritic steel substrates were used. We compare different doping methods: Na-doped Mo targets (MoNa), SLG underneath the flexible substrates, NaF and KF pre-absorber synthesis evaporation (PAS) and post-deposition evaporation (PDT). Additionally, we report on the importance of the Cr barrier and back contact modification to improve solar cell performance. A remarkable enhancement in the absorber grain size and surface morphology occurred especially when using Na via MoNa and PAS. Nevertheless, preliminary experiments led to better results for MoNa doping due to a higher Na content confirmed by TOF-SIMS. K doping via PAS also showed promising results. An increase in the efficiency of solar cells from 2.2% to 4.3% was possible when using a MoNa layer sandwiched between regular Mo layers. The improvement is mainly related to a higher VOC and FF. After performing a detailed Cr and back contact optimization, a record value of 6.1% for flexible CZTSe solar cells was recently obtained using MoNa and a new surface Ge doping.
Introduction
One of the main advantages of thin-film (TF) photovoltaic (PV) devices is the reduction of manufacturing costs due to their high power conversion efficiency, low material usage and low deposition cost on large areas, compared with the Si based previous PV generation. Currently, CuIn1–xGaxSe2 (CIGS) based solar cells hold the world record efficiency value among all TF technologies, 21.7%,1 but the majority of module production is based on glass substrates and its market share is still very low, at 10%.2 The fact of using light-weight and flexible substrates could further reduce the manufacturing costs due to their compatibility with high throughput roll-to-roll industrial processes and monolithic integration of solar cells on modules. Furthermore, the range of applications can be considerably broadened: building integration PV, portable electronic devices, space applications, etc. Despite the remarkable progress of CIGS, Cu2ZnSn(S1–xSex)4 (CZTSSe) absorbers are often seen as its future replacement in order to deal with In and Ga scarcity issues that could limit future PV deployment capacity at the TW level.3 After a steady performance improvement during the last 10 years CZTSSe recently reached the value of 12.6%.4 Therefore, the application of flexible and light-weight substrates combined with CZTSSe materials could ease the future penetration of TF technology in the competitive PV market.
Nowadays, promising efficiencies obtained by using flexible polyimide (PI) substrates equaling that of multicrystalline silicon based cells, 20.4%,5 encourage even more the research in this field. In the case of CZTSSe, only a small number of flexible devices are reported in the literature. CZTS cells via solution based methods were produced on PI (0.49%),6 Al foils (1.94%)7 and Mo foils (2.41%).8 Regarding vacuum based methods, sputtering deposition was used to produce CZTS solar cells on flexible glass substrates (3.09%)9 and stainless steel (SS) substrates (4.2%).10 CZTSe was also produced via sequential sputtering of metallic elements on stainless steel (SS) foils (3.5%).11
It can be concluded that their efficiency values are still far from those of glass relying devices, and among the reasons is certainly the lack of alkali dopants typical for flexible substrates. Na and more recently K are considered key dopants to obtain highly efficient devices for both CIGS and CZTSSe technologies.5,12–14 Na naturally out-diffuses from the SLG substrates to the absorber upon heating during the absorber synthesis.15 Nevertheless, it is much more convenient to effectively control its diffusion and final amount in the absorber via extrinsic supply from a Na precursor.16 Therefore, this is the suitable methodology when dealing with alkali-free flexible substrates. Usually NaF is used as the source of Na, and can be evaporated on the back contact prior to the absorber synthesis, during the absorber synthesis or incorporated via a post-deposition step.17 So far the highest efficiency values in the CIGS field have been obtained using a post-deposition treatment (PDT) with Na and/or K.1,5 Additionally, Na can be supplied from Na-doped molybdenum targets, Mo:Na, which is highly convenient for the industry since it will be already integrated in the back contact deposition step, increasing production throughput and reducing costs.18–23 In the case of K, the evaporation of KF and the use of enamelled substrates are the sources reported in the literature for CIGS.1,5,12,24,25 It should be noted that K is also naturally present in SLG although its content can be considered as negligible when compared to the amount of Na present in the same.26 The study of other alkali dopants such as Li, Cs and K was also reported for CIGS in the literature,16,27 but until very recently, mainly for Li in the CZTSSe field,28 with no better results in device performance when compared to Na doping. In any case, the combined effect of Na and K via PDT has been revealed as the key for the latest efficiency value advances in the CIGS field.5,12 In the case of CZTSSe, so far little work has been done, but NaF evaporation before absorber growth and Na incorporation as the precursor in the solution to synthesize CZTSSe via wet methods seem to be the dominant strategies.13,14,29
For CIGS, the effects of Na are commonly related to an increase in p-type conductivity (by reducing the donor density ND) via higher net hole concentration,27,30,31 enhanced grain growth and polycrystalline (112) texturing16,32 and reduced inter-diffusion of In and Ga17 with a direct impact on band gap grading. Nevertheless, contradictory reports in terms of grain growth and preferential orientation can also be found in the literature, making alkali doping a subject still open to debate.26 With regard to the effect of Na on solar cell electrical properties, an increase in VOC and FF is systematically reported.33–35
There are several models proposed to explain the beneficial effects of Na on CIGS absorbers, but among them a passivation of grain boundaries (GB) reducing donor defects is frequently referred to.36–38
Regarding the influence of Na on CZTSSe only a few publications are available. The reported effects are analogous to the ones observed for CIGS. A similar grain growth enhancement and (112) texturing have been observed.39–43 An increase in the device efficiency value, mainly coupled to a higher VOC and FF was also reported.14,40,44–46 This performance improvement was linked to an increase in hole density and mobility, a shallower acceptor level and reduction of certain deep trap centers.14,46,47 Moreover, a reduction in JSC has been coupled to a decrease in the Space Charge Region (SCR) and a slight decrease in minority carrier lifetime was noticed as well.14 For a non-vacuum process, based on knife coating of a Na containing nanocrystal (NC) ink, an increase in minority carrier lifetime was observed when comparing the Na containing CZTSSe absorber to a non-Na containing one.48 Finally, a positive effect for minority carrier transport has been proved for CZTSSe absorbers at the GBs, due to a higher positive potential attracting electrons and repelling holes.49 This effect could be related to an observed correlation between the Na content and passivation of non-radiative recombination centers at the GBs.50,51
In this work, we produce flexible CZTSe solar cells via a sequential synthesis process (sputtering + reactive annealing), using 50 μm thick ferritic SS substrates. Additionally, a Cr diffusion barrier is used to prevent Fe diffusion from the substrates. It should be noted that Fe is one of the most detrimental impurities that can diffuse into CIGS absorbers from steel substrates, since even very low quantities (1–7 ppm) can severely degrade solar cell performance.52,53 Herein we compare different methods to introduce Na and K into the CZTSe absorbers: Na-doped Mo targets (MoNa); a SLG piece underneath the flexible substrates during the annealing; NaF, KF pre-absorber synthesis evaporation; and post deposition evaporation (PDT), by analyzing changes in the absorber microstructure, alkali and impurities depth compositional profiles, and optoelectronic parameters of absorbers and solar cells. SEM, Raman, XRD, XRF, TOF-SIMS, EQE, J–V and C–V analyses are used for characterization. Finally, the relevance of the Cr barrier and back contact modification are also deeply investigated. As a result, a record efficiency of 6.1% for the flexible CZTSe device using MoNa and a new Ge doping was obtained.
Experimental
Substrate preparation
Ferritic SS foils (50 μm in thickness) were used as substrates. The substrates were mechanically polished to obtain a smooth surface (average roughness lower than 50 nm), and then carefully cleaned with a basic soap and rinsed with deionized water. Immediately after, they were subjected to an ultrasonic bath cleaning process with the following solvent sequence: acetone, isopropanol and deionized water. The time of the ultrasonic treatment for each solvent was 10 min at a temperature of 55 °C. Finally, the SS foils were dried with a nitrogen flux. Prior to the chemical barrier and back contact deposition, an additional surface treatment using radiofrequency (RF) plasma (100 W, 2 × 10−2 mbar Ar pressure, room temperature, 5 min) was used.
As a substrate, a multilayer configuration was chosen, mainly: a chemical barrier, a back electrical contact and an intermediate layer. The chemical barrier was a Cr layer with varying thicknesses (200 nm was used by our group in a previous study, see ref. 11) calibrated onto a glass substrate by X-ray fluorescence (XRF Fisherscope XVD) and deposited by direct current magnetron sputtering (DC-Sp) (200 W, 4.5 × 10−3 mbar of Ar, room temperature). Regarding the electrical back contact several Mo configurations were used and compared, based on Mo and MoNa (Na 5 at% and Na 10 at%) layers sputtered under different conditions. Finally, 10 nm thick ZnO was used as the intermediate layer. The details of the deposition of the ZnO intermediate layer were published elsewhere.54
In order to understand better the substrate configuration, two visual schemes are presented in Fig. 1A and B. Additionally, the different doping methods used in this work are also summarized in Fig. 1C. In Fig. 1A and B two different experimental parts can be distinguished: Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. Experiment 1 aims to establish a preliminary comparison between different doping methods in terms of CZTSe solar cell efficiency values and morphological, structural and alkali and metallic impurities in-depth compositional absorber features. In this experiment, a reference substrate configuration for the different doping methods to be studied (Fig. 1C(C2, C3 and C4)) with the exception of the MoNa case (Fig. 1C(C1)) consists of a 200 nm Cr barrier combined with 800 nm of MoA (Mo1) as the back contact. The MoNa layer will be deposited from a 5 at% MoNa target (MoNa5) and will have a special Mo “sandwiched” configuration to be optimized as it will be explained further on. In the case of Experiment 2, the goal is to investigate the effect of varying the Cr barrier and the Mo back contact on the performance of non-alkali doped flexible CZTSe solar cells, with the aim of improving the efficiency value of the cells considered as the reference. Furthermore, different MoNa layers sputtered from a 10 at% MoNa target (MoNa10) will be investigated using as well different Cr barriers and back contact layouts.

Additionally, the MoNa layer case relies on 5 at% MoNa target (MoNa5); (B) Experiment 2: influence of different Cr barriers (thickness and deposition conditions) and Mo back contacts: a monolayer (Mo1), a bi-layer (Mo2) and a tri-layer (Mo3) on non-alkali doped flexible CZTSe solar cell performance. Additionally, MoNa layers from 10 at% MoNa targets (MoNa10) were investigated using different Cr layers and back contact layout configurations. (C) Visual scheme of different alkali doping strategies used in this work: (C1) Na-doped Mo targets (MoNa), (C2) SLG piece underneath the flexible substrates, (C3) NaF, KF pre-absorber synthesis (PAS) evaporation and (C4) NaF, KF post deposition evaporation (PDT). 
As it was already mentioned, working with MoNa layers requires a special back contact configuration. The main reason is because Na is present in the MoNa layers as sodium molybdate Na2MoO4, and it is expected to diffuse through the grain boundaries of the MoNa layer, where more oxygen is present, towards the CZTSe absorber.19 Depending on the sputtering deposition conditions, mainly pressure, its diffusion can be enhanced. Higher pressures lead to more porous Mo or MoNa layers with more oxygen intergrain content that as mentioned before eases Na diffusion.19,22,55–57 In order to avoid easy and uncontrolled Na diffusion towards the surface of the layer upon exposure to the atmosphere, a Mo cap layer must be used. This layer not only can control Na diffusion, but also sheet resistance, since the MoNa layers have higher electrical resistance than their plain Mo counterparts (between 3 and 10 times depending on the Na content).19,55 This is related to a higher O content in the form of Na2MoO4. Taking this factor into account, the deposition conditions of the Mo cap layer on top of the MoNa layer can modify the Na diffusion depending as well on the sputtering conditions. Blösch et al. reported a detailed study on CIGS absorbers where low kinetic energy for the sputtering process of MoNa layers (3 kW cm−2, 0.6 Pa) and medium kinetic energy for the Mo layer (4 kW cm−2, 0.3 Pa) led to a level of Na in the absorbers analogue to the one obtained for SLG references. Furthermore, the efficiency value of the devices based on this configuration was the highest, using 250 nm of MoNa (10 at%) and a 500 nm of Mo cap layer.19 For this work similar sputtering conditions and layouts for the Mo/MoNa back contact designs were used as it can be seen for the Mo/MoNa configuration of Experiment 1 in Fig. 1A and Table 1. Table 1 includes a summary of layer thicknesses, thermal expansion coefficients (CTE) and average roughnesses (Ra), along with the main sputtering parameters to produce the different layers of all the multilayered substrate configurations.

It is important to take into account that our process line does not allow for an in-line deposition of the substrate configurations together with the Cu/Sn/Cu/Zn metallic stack, i.e. after producing the different substrates they are preserved in desiccators, with the aim of minimizing O2 and water exposure before the deposition of the metallic stack precursor. Usually a gap of 15–30 days was necessary before depositing the metallic stack and finishing absorbers and solar cells. In consequence, we observed that a layer of MoB as thick as 500 nm was usually necessary to avoid Na diffusion to the surface of the substrates. When reducing its thickness to 50, 250 or even 300 nm, the Na presence on the surface was already evident some hours later. Moreover, the MoNa layer thickness was also limiting in terms of avoiding the undesired Na diffusion before the precursor stack was completed. This was especially relevant when using Na concentrations of 10 at% (MoNa10), a maximum of 200 nm of MoNa was the thickness limit allowed (see the Mo/MoNa design of Experiment 2 in Fig. 1B). Nevertheless, when using MoNa5 (5 at% Na) up to 400 nm was possible. In summary, as it was prior mentioned, a MoNa “sandwiched” configuration was necessary to avoid poorer electrical performance and undesired Na diffusion towards the surface of the back contact configurations.
The substrate size was 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 in area in all cases.
It has to be noted that our previous work on flexible SS substrates was based on austenitic SS (AISI 304) with an average roughness (Ra) of about 20 nm. An efficiency value of 3.5% with no alkali addition and using a 200 nm thick Cr diffusion barrier along with 800 nm of Mo monolayer as the back contact (similar to the one used in Experiment 1 as it is shown in Fig. 1A) was obtained.11 In this work, despite the fact that the ferritic SS substrates (AISI 430) are slightly rougher than the austenitic SS substrates (Ra of about 40–50 nm obtained by AFM; see ESI Fig. S1†), the ferritic ones have a better CTE match with the different layers involved in the substrate configuration (see Table 1). Note that the CTE for austenitic SS substrates is about 17 × 10−6 K−1.58
Absorber preparation
To synthesize CZTSe absorbers, we employed a two stage process consisting of deposition of metallic stacks followed by a reactive annealing treatment. The sequence of metallic stack precursors is as follows: Cu/Sn/Cu/Zn; all the metallic layers were deposited by DC-Sp [see ref. 54 for detailed description of the deposition process]. The thicknesses were selected in order to have the following final composition, further confirmed by XRF using calibration samples grown onto glass: [Cu]/([Zn]+[Sn]) = 0.74–0.77 and [Zn]/[Sn] = 1.20–1.26. The annealing process was carried out in a three-zone tubular furnace, using a graphite box (69 cm3 in volume). A two-step thermal process consisting of a first treatment at 400 °C for 30 min (heating ramp 20 °C min−1, dynamic Ar flow of 1.5 mbar) and a subsequent second treatment at 550 °C for 15 min (heating ramp 20 °C min−1, total Ar pressure of 1 bar) was carried out. For the reactive atmosphere, 100 mg of Se (Alfa Aesar 99.999% purity) and 5 mg of Sn (Alfa Aesar 99.999% purity) were used. Finally, natural cooling down to room temperature was imposed.
To introduce alkali in our absorbers, NaF and/or KF were thermally evaporated (Univex 250 from Oerlikon) from the pure alkali fluorides (99.99% Sigma Aldrich) either before or after the absorber synthesis (see Fig. 1C(C3 and C4)).
Device preparation
The as-annealed absorber layers were submitted to an oxidizing chemical etching in acidic KMnO4 solution (40 s) followed by a passivating (NH4)2S (2 min) etching step (see ref. 59 and 60 for detailed description of the etching processes) to remove both ZnSe and SnxSey secondary phases. Additionally, a 2 min etching in 2% KCN aqueous solution was also performed. Immediately after, and with the aim to complete the solar cells, a CdS layer was deposited by chemical bath deposition (60 nm in thickness),61 i-ZnO (50 nm) and Sn2O3:In 350 nm, 50 Ω □ both by pulsed DC-Sp (CT100 Alliance Concepts). 3 × 3 mm2 cells were scribed using a micro-diamond scriber (MR200 OEG).
Materials characterization
The substrate roughness was characterized using a FEI NovaTM NanoSEM 230 microscope and an atomic force microscope AFM in tapping and contact modes (Park Systems XE-100). Structural features of absorbers were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. XRD was performed using a PANalytical X'Pert PRO MPD Alpha1 powder diffractometer in Bragg–Brentano θ/2θ geometry, 2θ from 4° to 145° with a step size of 0.017° and measuring time of 200 s per step, using Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) selected by using a Johansson type Ge (111) primary monochromator and an X'Celerator detector. Raman microprobe measurements were performed with a LabRam HR800-UV Horiba-Jobin Yvon spectrometer coupled with an Olympus metallographic microscope. Backscattering measurements were made with 532.5 nm excitation wavelengths by focusing the laser spot onto the surface of the layers. In order to avoid effects in the spectra related to potential microscopic inhomogeneities, the spot was rastered over an area of 30 × 30 μm2. The illumination power on the samples was kept below 0.4 mW to avoid the presence of thermal effects in the spectra. The morphology of the absorbers was also characterized by scanning electron microscopy. A Zeiss Auriga series field emission scanning electron microscope was used at 5 kV. In addition, elemental depth compositional profiles of full CZTSe solar cells were determined by time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS). A TOF-SIMS IV instrument from ION-TOF was used. An O2+ ion gun operating at 2 keV, current of 421 nA and raster size of 350 × 350 μm2 was used for sputtering. An area of 200 × 200 μm2 was analyzed using a 25 keV pulsed Bi3+ primary analysis ion gun.
Device characterization

J–V dark and illuminated curves (AM1.5G illumination with 1000 W m−2 intensity at room temperature) were obtained using a pre-calibrated Sun 3000 Class AAA solar simulator from Abet Technologies. The spectral response was measured in a pre-calibrated Bentham PVE300 system, allowing us to obtain the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the cells. Capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were performed in the dark at room temperature with a frequency of 100 kHz and a modulation voltage of 50 mV using an impedance analyzer from Novocontrol Technologies. From C–V measurements, charge carrier concentration profiles were calculated assuming a relative dielectric permittivity of ε = 8.5 for CZTSe.62,63
Results and discussion
Two different experiments (Experiment 1 and Experiment 2) were performed (see Fig. 1A and B). In Experiment 1 a first optimization of the different doping methods (see Fig. 1C) based on solar cell efficiency values and using a specific substrate configuration: 200 nm Cr + Mo monolayer for all the doping methods but the MoNa one, was carried out. In the case of the MoNa case, MoNa5 layers were used using different configurations as reported in Fig. 1A.
Regarding Experiment 2, an optimization of the reference solar cell case (non-doped) based on different Cr layers and back contact layouts was performed. Additionally, MoNa10 layers were used using different back contacts and barrier designs as it can be seen in Fig. 1B.
By using the knowledge gained throughout both experiments significant improvements in solar cell efficiency values were possible.
Experiment 1
An empirical approach was performed in order to tackle the optimum thickness of the MoNa5 (300–600 nm), coupled to different sputtering conditions, and NaF and/or KF layers (0, 10, 15 and 20 nm) by direct correlation with the performance of the solar cells based on the different absorbers. The results are shown in Table S1–S3 in the ESI.†
Morphological and structural characterization was performed in CZTSe absorbers and solar cells with the highest efficiency value obtained in this first experimental part by SEM, Raman spectroscopy and XRD.
Top and cross-sectional SEM images of the best absorbers and solar cells are shown in Fig. 2. The morphology of the absorber from the reference cell (non-doped), Fig. 2a, is completely analogous to the absorber doped with the SLG piece underneath the steel substrate (not shown here). Sharp and micron-sized large grains are formed even when no intentional Na is supplied to the absorber. The presence of 2D defects such as twin boundaries is significant. When Na is supplied, either from a MoNa target, Fig. 2b or from the PAS method, Fig. 2d, the morphology of the absorbers is completely changed. The grains are round in shape and the surface roughness is reduced. When supplying K from a PAS method (Fig. 2c) the grains are smaller (≤1 μm) than in the previous cases and sharper than for the MoNa case. Nevertheless, the surface morphology looks less rough and with less 2D defects than the reference case. In the case of the PDT (performed at 400 °C and 1 bar) no significant changes from the reference case can be distinguished in agreement with the literature.17,64 Additional SEM images to illustrate changes in grain morphology when using MoNa, NaF-PAS and KF-PAS can be found in the ESI (see Fig. S2–S4†).

TOF-SIMS was carried out in samples correlated with Fig. 2a–d. Depth compositional profiles of relevant elements are shown in Fig. 3. It is interesting to observe that despite using a Cr barrier a certain amount of Fe impurities and even larger amounts of Cr diffuse through the back CZTSe/Mo interface, especially in the case of the reference cell (Fig. 3a), KF-PAS (Fig. 3b) and NaF-PAS (Fig. 3d). The sample doped with MoNa barely present any Cr or Fe into the absorber, correlating with a higher efficiency value as it will be shown later. The fact of using a different back contact layout that in the case of the other doping methods (see Fig. 1A, the Mo/MoNa configuration of Experiment 1), might be the reason for a better Fe and Cr diffusion control. The influence of Mo back contact thickness and sputtering deposition conditions on Fe diffusion has been reported for CIGS.52,53,65 We discard possible misinterpretations of the elemental profiles due to the substrate roughness, because all the substrates were produced in the same batch with almost identical characteristics. Regarding the Na and K levels, the highest values were obtained via MoNa and KF-PAS compared with the NaF-PAS method, as it can be seen in Fig. 3. Both Na and K tend to accumulate at the back contact region as expected, and their levels are reduced when diffusing into the absorbers. Nevertheless, the level of K in the absorber is much more homogeneous than the Na level, especially if we compare Fig. 3b with Fig. 3a and d. This could be in agreement with the fact that the KF-PAS doped sample clearly has the smallest grain size as it can be seen in Fig. 2c. In consequence, if K tends to accumulate in the grain boundaries (GBs) as it was already reported for CIGS, a higher density of them could host more quantity of this alkali element.66 In the case of MoNa doping, Fig. 3c, the Na has a U-graded profile, increasing again its level at the CdS/CZTSe interface, even diffusing into the TCO layer. Since this sample has the highest solar cell efficiency value among samples analyzed in Experiment 1, as it will be shown later, this U-profile might be related to a better cell performance. Nevertheless, the possibility of an enhanced number of Na counts at the CdS/CZTSe interface due to matrix effects cannot be discarded.

In view of the TOF-SIMS results, XRD structural characterization was performed with the aim of detecting secondary phases related to the impurity diffusion towards the absorber that was previously observed. XRD patterns of the same set of samples analyzed by SEM and TOF-SIMS were collected. The results are included in Fig. 4. Additionally, XRD results of the bare SS430 substrate and combined with a monolayer (Mo1) back contact configuration and a Mo/Mona one (see Fig. 1, Experiment 1) are included in Fig. S5 of the ESI.†
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of substrate configurations from Experiment 1 (Mo1 and Mo/MoNa) and non-doped, KF-PAS, NaF-PAS and MoNa doped CZTSe absorbers grown on them. 
Before analyzing the singularities in terms of crystalline features and secondary phases presence of the alkali doped and non-doped CZTSe absorbers, it is important to highlight the differences between the two substrate configurations that are used in Experiment 1. The XRD pattern of Mo1 configuration (light blue) is clearly textured in the (111) direction when compared to the Mo/MoNa configuration (navy blue), which is more oriented in the typical (110) direction.
Another interesting feature to be commented is the reduction of MoSe2 formation (JCPDS-04-008-0187), especially for the case relying on the Mo/MoNa substrate configuration. The upper and relatively porous MoB layer (compared with MoA) of this substrate configuration is an effective barrier against selenization. A higher residual oxygen incorporation in the Mo, due to more intergrain space, during the sputtering process could be the reason, since a higher oxygen content in the Mo has been linked with MoS(e)2 reduction.51,67 Interestingly, the highest MoSe2 formation was produced for the KF-PAS doping, followed by the reference cell case (non-doped) and the NaF-PAS one respectively. In the literature, both an increase and a decrease of MoSe2 formation have been linked to either the absence of Na or its presence, and thereby still being an object for discussion.33,68,69
All the characteristic peaks of CZTSe have been identified in all the absorbers (JCPDS-04-010-6295). No significant texture changes can be distinguished after the introduction of the alkali dopants, in contrast with the literature.39,41 To assess the crystalline quality, the values of FWHM have been obtained from the main 112 peak of the different CZTSe absorbers. Additionally, the tetragonal a and c lattice parameters of the CZTSe phase have been determined using the interplanar d spacing of the 400 and 008 reflections, in the 2θ angular range from 65.2° to 66.2°. Both the FWHM and the a and c cell parameters (with the calculated cell volume from them), are included in Table S4 of the ESI.†
The lowest value of FWHM belongs to the SLG doping case (XRD not shown due to high similarities to the reference cell) and the highest to the MoNa case. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the range which FWHM values cover is relatively narrow, and all absorbers are well crystallized as it can be seen in Fig. 2. Additional structural characterization by Raman spectroscopy, including FWHM and Raman shift of the main A mode, can be found in Fig. S6 of the ESI.†
The values of lattice parameters are in good agreement with experimental values reported in the literature.70,71 The unit cell volume for either the reference cell case or the samples doped with Na (MoNa and NaF-PAS) and SLG is larger than the one based on K. In any case, no clear trend regarding Na incorporation into the unit cell volume can be drawn, in contrast with theoretical predictions which foresaw an increase.72
Regarding the presence of secondary phases, the XRD pattern of the sample considered as the reference (non-doped) clearly shows the presence of additional peaks marked with black and grey arrows in Fig. 4, when compared to the other analyzed absorbers. The black peaks have been indexed to powder diffraction data from the card JCPDS-04-004-0394, belonging to a cubic phase of CuCrSnSe4. This compound is a normal spinel, space group Fd3m, and has been synthesized as a single crystal and polycrystalline powder.73,74 The grey arrow could indicate the presence of a CuCrO2 phase (JCPDS-04-001-7400). The presence of these spurious phases, mainly CuCrSnSe4, clearly agrees with the TOF-SIMS results from Fig. 3a, since there is a large presence of Cr at the back CZTSe region due to in-diffusion from the Cr barrier layer during the absorber sintering. It has to be noted that the XRD pattern of the CZTSe absorber based on SLG doping also clearly shows the CuCrSnSe4 phase (results not shown, due to a similar XRD pattern to that of the reference cell). In order to visualize better the contribution of this secondary phase to the XRD pattern of the reference cell, a zoom-in on the angular region from 20° to 50° (in which this spinel phase has the most intense diffraction peaks) comparing the ref cell, the NaF-PAS based one (with similar or higher Cr in diffusion) and the MoNa based case (with the absence of CuCrSnSe4) is included in Fig. S7 of the ESI.† Nevertheless, a question that is reasonable to make is why this CuCrSnSe4 phase with multiple intense enough reflections in Fig. 4 for the reference cell is only hardly observed for the KF-PAS and NaF-PAS doped samples (see Fig. S7†) if they show a similar or even larger Cr in-diffusion at the back region (see Fig. 3b and d)? It seems that the alkali doping is preventing the formation of this Cr based secondary phase. In the case of Na doping, it has been reported using density functional theory that Nai, i.e. Na going to interstitial positions, is the most energetically favored Na related defect formation.72 Nevertheless, due to fairly similar ionic radii of Na+, Cu+ and Zn2+, cationic substitutions such as NaCu and NaZn have relatively low energy formation, and thereby their occurrence could be as well perfectly possible.75 In the sample doped by the NaF-PAS method the level of Na is very high, especially at the back region. In consequence, it could be possible that Na occupied preferentially cationic positions that Cr could have migrated to if the alkali was not present in large amounts, as in the case of the non-doped reference cell. It should be noted that Cu+ and Zn2+ have identical ionic radii, and Cr3+ has only a slightly larger value, i.e. making possible the occupancy of both sites.76 In the case of K, since the ionic radius is larger it makes energetically much more demanding both interstitial occupancy and cationic substitutions.75 Nevertheless, other reports based on ab initio calculations establish the substitutional energy of KCu as relatively low making this defect formation more possible.77 At the same time, it should be noted that the level of Na at the back Mo/CZTSe interface is larger for the KF-PAS doped sample than for the reference cell. A synergy between both alkali elements would be in agreement with the literature, since ion exchange between K and Na has been reported.5,78 As a result, some Na incorporation from for instance the graphite box used during the annealing could be taking place.
To the best of our knowledge this is the first time this CuCrSnSe4 phase is reported along with the kesterite phase. Additionally, the significant reduction with almost suppression of the formation of this phase when large amounts of alkali are present could be experimental evidence of Na and/or K going to cationic lattice sites in the kesterite structure, a topic that so far is in the domain of speculation arising from theoretical calculations.
The impact of the different doping methods on the CZTSe solar cell performance can be understood by J–V illuminated curves in Fig. 5a. Additionally, a summary with the main optoelectronic parameters is added in Table 2, and Fig. S8 of the ESI† shows the average efficiency values and standard deviation. The doping clearly improves the efficiency value of the reference cell, 2.2% in absolute, by increasing mainly VOC and FF, except for the NaF-PAS case. The reason could be a lower effective Na level in the absorber as it can be seen in Fig. 3d, combined with a high degree of impurity diffusion, Cr and Fe. A maximum efficiency value of 4.3% for the MoNa case and 3.4% for KF-PAS was obtained. The optimum substrate configuration for the Mo/MoNa case is as follows: 200 nm Cr + 150 nm MoA + 300 nm MoNa (0.6 Pa) + 500 nm MoB (see the Mo/MoNa design of Experiment 1 in Fig. 1A).

It is important to note that despite not observing any relevant change in the CZTSe microstructure when using SLG as the doping source, the efficiency value of the related solar cell increased. Furthermore, the TOF-SIMS of this sample was not included in Fig. 3 since a very similar Na and K elemental depth profile as for the reference cell was obtained. PDT cases also led to better efficiencies than the reference case but below the 3% level achieved by the SLG method.
The impact of the doping in the cells current collection was analyzed using EQE (Fig. 5b). The differences below 500 nm can be linked to variations in the TCO process, but between 500 and 710 nm a remarkable increase in the EQE can be seen for all the doped samples but especially for the MoNa and KF-PAS based ones. Those samples have actually the highest alkali content towards the absorber surface. It is likely that the doping has modified the junction properties since this spectral region matches this part of the solar cell. For carriers collected deeper in the absorber, from 700 to 1150 nm, the EQE increases for the KF-PAS and MoNa cells when compared with the reference cell. This is linked to a lower diffusion of Cr and Fe impurities into the absorber and to a higher alkali content in the CZTSe bulk and back region. Accordingly, the NaF-PAS sample has a lower EQE value since the Cr diffusion is the highest among the samples analyzed in Fig. 3 and the Fe diffusion is also significant. It can be concluded that even if Na can diffuse into the absorber, if the presence of impurities is important the efficiency value will inevitably drop. This is in agreement with the literature, since studies about the effect of Fe and Cr impurities on CIGS performance when present in the absorber have been reported. In general Fe was found to be much more detrimental than Cr, but both impurities can induce deep defects in CIGS absorbers, close to mid-gap, acting as recombination centers for photogenerated carriers and thereby reducing device performance.53,79
The observed higher EQE at long wavelengths, correlating with a better collection of electrons generated deep in the absorber, can be linked to a higher passivation of undesired defects due to the alkali diffusion into the CZTSe bulk. A reduction of non-radiative recombination centers at the bulk has been frequently connected with the Na effect.46,50,51
It is evident that impurity diffusion when using metallic substrates is a paramount issue to improve device performance. Therefore, with the aim of enhancing the efficiency value of the reference case (the non-doped sample) Experiment 2 was performed.
Experiment 2
The influence of Cr thickness and deposition conditions along with a variation in the Mo back contact configuration on solar cell performance was investigated within Experiment 2 (see Fig. 1B).
Table S5 of the ESI.† shows the results from the study based on the Cr diffusion barrier, where two different thickness and sputtering deposition conditions were studied. A 500 nm Cr barrier sputtered under the conditions reported in Table 1 led to better results when using 800 nm of MoA as the back contact compared with a thinner 200 nm Cr barrier.
Changes in the Mo back contact were also investigated, and the results are summarized in Table S6 of the ESI.† It can be concluded that just changing the Mo back contact can have an important impact on solar cell parameters as it can act as a diffusion barrier for Fe and Cr impurities.52,53

J–V illuminated curves summarizing the most relevant results obtained from Tables S5 and S6 from the ESI.† are shown in Fig. 6a. The results showed that a 500 nm Cr barrier combined with a Mo tri-layer configuration led to the highest CZTSe solar cell efficiency value of 4.1% (see Table S6 from the ESI.† for a summary of main optoelectronic parameters). The corresponding EQE plots are shown in Fig. 6b. It is possible to correlate a reduction in photocurrent (JSC) with Fe and Cr impurity diffusion when using a thin Cr barrier and/or non-optimal Mo back contact, in agreement with the literature.52,53 It has to be noted that since a 500 nm Cr barrier allowed for the best result, a 1 μm thick Cr barrier with a Mo tri-layer was also tested in CZTSe solar cells but the results were clearly worst. Table S6† from the ESI shows the optoelectronic parameters of the best CZTSe cell using a 1 μm thick Cr barrier.

A further refinement of the deposition parameters of the doping case that led to the best results in Experiment 1 (MoNa) was also investigated in Experiment 2 using the findings about the Cr barrier and back contact ideal configurations (see Fig. 1B). An empirical approach similar to the one performed in Experiment 1 for the MoNa5 case was also performed with MoNa10 layers in Experiment 2. The results are summarized in Table S7 and S8 of the ESI.† An efficiency value of 4.4% very similar to the one obtained for MoNa5 in Experiment 1 was obtained for MoNa10 layers prepared in Experiment 2. Moreover, an efficiency value increase from 3.3% to 4.4% when going from MoNa10 layers sputtered from 0.2 Pa to 0.6 Pa is consistent with the observations reported by Blösch et al. for CIGS solar cells.19 An increase in the sodium diffusion due to a more porous MoNa layer is responsible for the efficiency value increase. Higher sputtering pressure values led to lower cell performance as it can be seen in Table S8 of the ESI.†
The optimum configuration for the Mo/MoNa case is as follows: 500 nm Cr + 250 nm MoA + 100 nm MoNa (0.6 Pa) + 500 nm MoB + 30 nm MoA (see the Mo/MoNa design of Experiment 2 in Fig. 1B).
Due to the improvement with respect to the reference case (non-doped sample) in terms of the CZTSe solar cell efficiency value, recent experiments led to a new record for a flexible CZTSe device combining the new substrate configuration (500 nm Cr + Mo tri-layer) and the new MoNa10 configuration with KF-PAS and an innovative recently reported Ge doping, respectively.80 5.6% and 6.1% efficient flexible CZTSe solar cells were obtained using KF-PAS and MoNa/Ge doping methods, as it can be seen in Fig. 7avia J–V illuminated curves and a summary with the main optoelectronic parameters. Additionally, the net carrier doping profiles as determined by C–V measurements are plotted in Fig. 7b. A higher hole concentration Na (from the minima of the doping profiles) and narrower space charge region W are obtained when doping with K via the KF-PAS method when compared with the non-doped reference cell case. This could be in agreement with previous findings for K doping in CIGS.5,25,78,81 The increase in VOC (ΔVOC) based on the higher net doping concentration for the case of KF-PAS with respect to the reference case has been estimated (see eqn (S1) of the ESI.†). The value is only 9.4 mV, compared with the experimental VOC increase of ΔVOC = 58 mV (see Fig. 7a). Therefore, it can be easily concluded that K doping in addition to the increase in the hole concentration must have other beneficial properties related to electronic transport. A similar passivation of donor and deep defects at the Grain Boundaries (GBs), significantly reducing non-radiative recombination, as already observed for Na doping could also take place.14,50 Furthermore, a reduction of interface recombination at the CdS/CIGS interface due to a K induced Cu depleted surface creating an electronically inverted absorber surface (n-type) has been reported as a plausible cause for a significant VOC and FF increase.5,78,82 This might be possible in the CZTSe case as well.
 Fig. 7  (a) J–V illuminated curves of flexible CZTSe solar cells based on a 500 nm Cr barrier and Mo tri-layer (Mo3) back contact as the substrate configuration using different doping methods: non-doped, KF-PAS and MoNa + Ge. (b) Charge carrier concentration profiles (Na) in dependence of the depletion width (W) derived from C–V measurements (100 kHz, 300 K, dark) of CZTSe solar cells with no alkali doping (the reference cell), KF-PAS and MoNa + Ge doping. 
Interestingly, the hole concentration for the MoNa + Ge case is lower than that for the reference case, even when a Na alkali metal, well known for increasing the majority carrier concentration in CZTSSe,14,41,48 is introduced into the absorber. A possible explanation might be related to the presence of Ge, since a special synergy between Na and this group IV metal could be in the origin of the improved characteristics of devices doped with both elements.80 Further work on the interaction between alkaline elements and Ge is foreseen. In any case, since the highest efficiency value and larger VOC (360 mV) were obtained for this sample, even though the hole concentration was lower than that for the reference case, it seems evident as explained before that Na assisted defect passivation, probably at the GBs, is paramount for the VOC, FF and efficiency value increase.
In summary, after a preliminary experimental comparison of different alkali doping methods, we conclude that MoNa doping was the most effective way to effectively dope our flexible CZTSe absorbers due to a deeper and more homogeneous doping when compared to PAS methods. Nevertheless, the KF-PAS method showed promising results. Additionally, a processing optimization for the reference case (non-doped) based on the Cr barrier and back contact modification led to an important improvement from 2.2% to 4.1% efficient CZTSe solar cells. As a result, combining this new substrate configuration and an optimum Mo/MoNa back contact design using the KF-PAS method and an innovative surface Ge doping, respectively, record 5.6% and 6.1% efficient flexible CZTSe solar cells were obtained.
Conclusions
We have compared different methodologies used to induce the beneficial diffusion of Na and K alkaline elements into CZTSe absorbers and solar cells deposited on flexible and light weight steel substrates. Relevant changes in the surface morphology of the absorbers and in the grain size can be observed, especially in the case of Na diffusing from MoNa and NaF PAS methods. Larger and round-shaped grains up to the absorber thickness are formed using both the methods. Nevertheless, the higher alkali content in the absorbers was measured by TOF-SIMS when comparing MoNa doping using the PAS method.
TOF-SIMS also revealed that a 200 nm Cr diffusion barrier with a Mo monolayer configuration was not sufficient to prevent Fe diffusion from the steel substrate and also significant Cr in-diffusion towards the absorber. In contrast, when using the same barrier thickness, but a more complex back contact configuration such as the one of Mo/MoNa, Cr and Fe impurities were effectively reduced. As a result of the impurity diffusion towards the absorber, a rare CuCrSnSe4 cubic spinel phase, never reported before along with CZTSe, was detected by XRD, especially for the non-doped CZTSe absorbers. Interestingly, when doping using KF and NaF-PAS methods this phase was almost suppressed, pointing out to a possible inhibition of Cr occupancy in Cu and Zn CZTSe cationic sites due to Na and K prevalent occupation of the same lattice sites.
The best solar cells clearly correlated with the highest alkali content in the absorber and/or a lower diffusion of Cr and Fe impurities into the same. An increase from 2.2% to 4.3% efficient CZTSe solar cells was obtained when depositing a 300 nm MoNa layer (Na 5 at%), sandwiched between different Mo layers. In addition, K doping also showed promising results.
After performing an extensive Cr barrier and back contact optimization, a 500 nm Cr barrier combined with a Mo tri-layer back contact allowed us to increase the reference cell efficiency value from 2.2% to 4.1%. By using this new substrate configuration and an optimized layout for Mo/MoNa architectures, record 5.6% and 6.1% flexible CZTSe cells were obtained when using KF-PAS and MoNa combined with a new Ge doping, respectively. An increase in the net carrier concentration when doping with K was also confirmed.
Based on the experimental results, we believe that there is still a large room for improvement by further tuning of the diffusion barrier, doping level, back contact and absorber annealing conditions.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (A) Experiment 1: impact of different alkali doping methods (but the MoNa case) on flexible CZTSe solar cell performance using as reference substrates: a 200 nm Cr barrier and a Mo monolayer (Mo1) back contact. Additionally, the MoNa layer case relies on 5 at% MoNa target (MoNa5); (B) Experiment 2: influence of different Cr barriers (thickness and deposition conditions) and Mo back contacts: a monolayer (Mo1), a bi-layer (Mo2) and a tri-layer (Mo3) on non-alkali doped flexible CZTSe solar cell performance. Additionally, MoNa layers from 10 at% MoNa targets (MoNa10) were investigated using different Cr layers and back contact layout configurations. (C) Visual scheme of different alkali doping strategies used in this work: (C1) Na-doped Mo targets (MoNa), (C2) SLG piece underneath the flexible substrates, (C3) NaF, KF pre-absorber synthesis (PAS) evaporation and (C4) NaF, KF post deposition evaporation (PDT).
