    , Accepted 24th January 2019First published on 25th January 2019AbstractTwo regio-asymmetric polymers PR2F and PR1F with three repeat units A–D–A, π–D–A, and π–D–π along the polymer backbone were obtained by polymerizing different fluorinated benzothiadiazole–thiophene units, FBT-T and 2FBT-T units (A–π), with a benzodithiophene unit (D), respectively. Here, the new regio-asymmetric polymers were different from traditional polymers featuring a D–A or D–π–A–π backbone. Both the regio-asymmetric polymers showed a low lying HOMO energy level in relation to that of the PC61BM acceptor and then a high open-circuit voltage of ∼1 V was observed in both PR2F and PR1F devices. Bulk-heterojunction devices based on PR2F with difluorinated BT exhibited an appreciable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.73% due to the relatively high and balanced charge carrier mobilities, while the mono-fluorinated BT polymer PR1F-based devices showed a lower PCE of 2.92%. These results indicate that the regio-asymmetric conjugated polymers are a promising class of materials for polymer solar cell applications, and it is significant to further understand the influence of the polymer structure on the optoelectronic properties.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been extensively investigated in recent years due to their unique advantages such as light weight, low-cost, large-area fabrication, solution processability and mechanical flexibility.1–5 Over the past decade, great efforts have been devoted towards maximizing the performance of PSCs, and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs exceeding 14% have been demonstrated in single-junction cells,6 which heralds the bright future of the practical application of PSCs.7–10 The active layer materials are of vital importance because they determine not only the maximum attainable current density (JSC), but also the highest open-circuit voltage (VOC) and the fill factor (FF) of PSCs.11,12 It was well-studied that the deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level for high VOC and sufficient offset of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level between a polymer donor and a fullerene acceptor are important to achieve high performance PSCs.13 The molecular structures of the polymers enable control of the optoelectronic properties,14–16 such as optical gaps and orbital energy levels, and relevant bulk properties (charge carrier mobility and film morphology), which combine to control the photovoltaic device performance.17,18
For achieving these desired properties, a common design strategy for polymer donors that incorporate molecular electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) units in an alternating manner to create the traditional architecture (D–A or D–π–A–π) was proposed.19–21 Recently, many results showed that the introduction of an asymmetric monomer into regioregular polymers could typically results in a greater degree of crystallinity and thus higher device performance.15,22,23 For example, Zhou and co-workers reported that the random polymer 2TRA exhibited a substantially higher PCE (8.8%) than the regioregular polymer 2TRR (5.1%), where both polymers 2TRA and 2TRR contained the same type and proportion of subunits but with different connectivity.24 Yang's group have designed and synthesized a new type of polymer P1T with a repeat unit D–π–A or D–π by breaking the traditional D–A or D–π–A–π configuration. And the asymmetric polymer P1T device exhibited the optimal PCE with an active layer thickness of over 200 nm.23 Therefore, the construction of a novel asymmetric polymer would expand its potential use in high-efficiency photovoltaic applications. Moreover, the substitution of fluorine (F) atoms on the conjugated backbones has recently shown remarkable results in PSCs, arising from their ability of efficient charge transport and proper formation of a nanoscale morphology with fullerene derivatives because of the electronegative effect of the F atom and intra/intermolecular interactions between the F atom and other atoms.25–29 These may give rise to a deep HOMO for a high VOC of the PSCs and an ordered crystalline structure for a high hole mobility and further improve the photovoltaic performance of the devices.
Hence, we designed two regio-asymmetric polymers PR2F and PR1F by introducing classical benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene (BDT) and fluorinated benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (2FBT or FBT) as D and A units, respectively. The new A segments were obtained by coupling one aromatic thiophene (T) unit as the “π-spacer” to the 2FBT and FBT units to construct the FBT-T and 2FBT-T moieties (A–π), respectively, which obviously differ from the traditional A and π–A–π units in typical conjugated polymers.23 The molecular structures of the repeat units and relevant polymers PR2F and PR1F are shown in Fig. 1 and Scheme 1, which highlights the three repeat units A–D–A, π–D–A, and π–D–π along the polymer backbone in our molecular design. Therefore, the two regio-asymmetric polymers differ from conventional polymers featuring a D–A or D–π–A–π backbone. Both polymers show a low lying HOMO energy level in relation to that of the PC61BM acceptor and then exhibit a high VOC of ∼1 V in both PR2F and PR1F devices. The PR2F:PC61BM devices exhibited an appreciable PCE of 4.73%, while the PR1F/PC61BM blend devices exhibited a lower PCE of 2.92%. It can be seen that the regio-asymmetric polymers are a novel idea to design active layer donor materials for realizing high performance solar cells, and it is significant to further understand the influence of the polymer structure on the optoelectronic properties.

2. Experimental details
2.1. General

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Advance III (400 MHz and 100 MHz, respectively) spectrometer in CDCl3 and under ambient conditions. HR-MS experiments were performed using a Waters SYNAPT MS. Elemental analysis (EA) was performed on a FLASH EA 1112 elemental analyzer. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Shimadzu UV-2006 ultraviolet–visible spectroscope. CV measurements were performed on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation under an argon atmosphere in a solution of nBu4NPF6 (0.1 M) in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at ambient temperature with a three-electrode cell consisting of a Pt working electrode, a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) and a Pt wire counter electrode. Polymer thin films were formed by drop-casting a chloroform solution (analytical reagent, 1 mg mL−1) onto the working electrode, and then drying in air. The platinum reference electrode was calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple as an external standard, whose oxidation potential is set at −4.8 eV with respect to the zero vacuum level, HOMO = −(Eonox − E1/2, Fc) + (−4.8) eV and LUMO = −(Eonred − E1/2, Fc) + (−4.8) eV. The molecular weights and distributions of PR2F and PR1F were measured by the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) method on a Waters 1515 with polystyrenes as the reference standard and THF as an eluent at 40 °C. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on a STA-409 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the polymers were recorded using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS980. The surface roughness and morphology of the thin films were characterized by using a tapping-mode atomic force microscope (AFM, Agilent 5400).
2.2. Synthesis and characterization
All chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification, except that toluene was dried over Na/benzophenone ketyl and freshly distilled prior to use. All air and water sensitive reactions were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. Monomers M1, M2, M3 and M4 were synthesized according to the literature methods.24PR2F and PR1F were synthesized by Stille polymerization. The synthesis details are described below.

Then the mixture was stirred at 110 °C for 60 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling down to room temperature, the reaction mixture was precipitated in methanol and filtered through a Soxhlet thimble.

2.3. Fabrication and characterization of solar cells
ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by sonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol and dried under a nitrogen stream, and 40 nm thick PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto ITO, and then the substrate was baked at 120 °C for 15 min in air. The photoactive layer was subsequently prepared by spin coating a solution of the copolymer and PC61BM (1:1.5, w/w) in CB on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode. The concentration of the blend solution was 20 mg mL−1. The photoactive layer was then methanol vapour annealed at 30 °C for 15 s. Finally, a layer of 1 nm LiF and 100 nm Al was vacuum evaporated onto the photoactive layer through a shadow mask in a vacuum of ca. 10−4 Pa. The effective area of the device was 0.04 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices in the dark and under illumination were measured using a programmable Keithley 2400 measurement source. The cells were illuminated using an AM 1.5 G solar simulator (ABET Technologies Sun 3000 Solar Simulator) with reference to a standard Si cell calibrated at NREL at an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. External quantum efficiency (EQE) as a function of wavelength was recorded using a ZOLIX CSC1011, where the light source was an Ushio UXL-553 xenon short arc lamp. The thicknesses of the active layers were measured by using a KLA Tencor D-120 profilometer. The hole and electron mobilities were measured by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with the device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/polymer:PC61BM/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) and ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC61BM/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm), respectively. The SCLC is defined as: J = 9ε0εrμeV2/8d3, where J is the current density, εr is the dielectric constant of the polymers, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, μe is the mobility, d is the thickness of the active layer, and V is the internal potential in the device. The internal potential can be written as V = Vappl − Vbi − Va, where Vappl is the applied voltage to the device, Vbi is the built-in potential determined using the electrode work function difference, and Va is the voltage drop due to contact resistance and series resistance across the electrodes. The mobility was calculated from the slope of J1/2–V plots.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and characterization of the polymers
The detailed synthesis procedure for the four A–π monomers (M1, M2, M3 and M4) and the relevant polymers (PR2F and PR1F) is shown in Scheme 1 and described in the Experimental section. The key monomers M1 and M2 were prepared using Stille polymerization with dibrominated FBT/2FBT and mono-stannylated T in a ratio of 1:1 in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst in 68% yield. Bromination of M1 or M2 with NBS gave the dibrominated FBT-T/2FBT-T monomer (M3 or M4) in a high yield of 93%. The final polymers PR2F and PR1F were also synthesized via Stille polymerization between the distannylated BDT monomer and the dibrominated FBT-T/2FBT-T monomer (M3 or M4) in a good yield (80%). It should be noted that each BDT end could chemically couple with a T or FBT/2FBT end in the FBT-T/2FBT-T segments, so the same subunits (T and FBT-T/2FBT-T) can be arranged in different configurations along the polymer backbone (Fig. 1). The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and the polydispersity index (PDI) of the regio-asymmetric polymers PR2F and PR1F were analyzed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with THF as the eluent. The Mn values of PR2F and PR1F are 24.9 kDa and 61.9 kDa, respectively, corresponding to PDI values of 3.31 and 1.91. The lower molecular weight and the larger PDI value of PR2F might be due to its limited solubility.
A theoretical calculation based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the Gaussian 09 with B3LYP functional and 6-31G basis sets was carried out to analyze different configurations along the polymer backbone and the electron density distribution at the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the two polymers. Due to the characteristics of its regio-asymmetry, the skeleton has no fixed repeating unit compared with a traditional regular structure and a random structure. In this work, we only calculated three repeat units A–D–A, π–D–A, and π–D–π along the polymer backbone of P1 and P2. The three distinct repeat units in the backbone of each polymer under ideal conditions with the alkyl chains substituted by methyl groups were selected for ease of calculation. As illustrated in Fig. 2, both the optimized structures of the repeating building blocks of PR2F and PR1F showed excellent co-planarity with a dihedral angle of less than 10° between the BDT, T and fluorinated BT (FBT or 2FBT) units because of the intra/intermolecular interactions between the F atom and other atoms.25,27 Such a good co-planarity and electron distribution in the frontier molecular orbitals of the PR1F and PR2F backbones would contribute to the efficiency of the charge transport along the extended π-conjugation path. The HOMO electron density of the distinct repeat units in PR2F and PR1F is delocalized over the whole polymer backbone basically, while the LUMO electron density is primarily concentrated on the fluorinated BT groups. There is hardly any electron density distribution on the alkylthio-T conjugated side chains of the repeating building blocks of PR2F and PR1F. The simulated HOMO levels of PR2F and PR1F are −5.05 and −4.95 eV, and the simulated LUMO levels of PR2F and PR1F are −3.09 and −3.04 eV, respectively.

3.2. Optical, electrochemical and thermal properties

Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectra of PR2F and PR1F in chloroform solution and thin solid films. From solution to film, the two polymers demonstrated strong and broad absorption spectra in the wavelength region from 300 nm to 750 nm and became broader and red-shifted due to the aggregation of the polymer chains in the solid state.30 The well-defined absorption peaks both in solution and thin films with a vibronic shoulder in the longer wavelength range imply the existence of ordered aggregation and strong π–π stacking induced by the F atoms. Corresponding to the intramolecular charge transfer interaction between the D and A units, the two absorption peaks of the film at the long wavelength implicate a high degree of molecular order within the film.31 The optical band gaps (Eoptg) of PR2F and PR1F were calculated from the absorption edge of the thin films to be 1.75 and 1.73 eV, respectively.
 Fig. 3  Normalized absorption spectra of the copolymers in chloroform solution (a) and in thin films (b). 
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to estimate the electronic energy levels of the two conjugated polymers, and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated from the onset oxidation (Eonox) and reduction (Eonred) potentials by assuming the energy level of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) to be −4.8 eV below the vacuum level. The LUMO and HOMO levels of PR2F and PR1F are −3.89/−5.34 eV and −3.87/−5.29 eV, respectively, which agree with the results of the DFT calculations, as shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1. When the number of F atoms per repeating segment was increased from 1 to 2, the enhanced effective density of the fluorinated BT units in the polymer backbone led to lower HOMO and LUMO levels.32 Consequently, a high VOC of the PSC device is expected. The electrochemical bandgap values (ECVg) estimated by ECVg = LUMO–HOMO (eV) were very similar, and are 1.45 and 1.43 eV for PR2F and PR1F, respectively. Their respective energy level diagram is outlined in Fig. 4b. The HOMO energy levels of PR2F and PR1F are generally lower than that of ITO; meanwhile, the LUMO energy levels of PR2F and PR1F are slightly higher than that of PC61BM and the LUMO energy offsets are about 0.4 eV. Such an energy alignment not only allows charge collection from the anode but also provides a sufficient driving force for transferring the excited electrons to the PC61BM acceptor materials.

The thermal properties of the polymers were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1. It is noteworthy that the decomposition temperature (Td) estimated from the onset point of the 5% weight loss of polymer PR2F (339 °C) was higher than that of PR1F (323 °C). The thermal stabilities of PR2F and PR1F are good enough for their application in PSCs.

3.3. Photovoltaic properties
A conventional PSC architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al was fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the two polymers PR2F and PR1F as donor materials. It was prepared by spin-coating the blend solution of polymer:PC61BM (1:1.5, w/w) in chlorobenzene with 2% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the additive. Typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are presented in Fig. 6 and the key device parameters of the PSCs with and without solution vapour annealing (SVA) are summarized in Table 2. Compared with the PR1F:PC61BM device without SVA, which delivered a low efficiency of 2.58%, the PR2F:PC61BM device showed a remarkable increase in the PCE to 3.26% with a VOC of 0.97 V, a JSC of 7.08 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.48. In addition, after SVA with methanol, the overall performance of the devices from both polymer donor materials was enhanced as a result of the enhancement of JSC. It is shown that the PSCs based on PR1F showed a PCE of 2.92%, with a VOC of 0.93 V, a JSC of 7.97 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.39, while the PR2F-based device substantially showed an improvement in the efficiency to 4.73%, with a VOC of 0.98 V, JSC of 10.01 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.48. The VOC, however, is seen to be higher than that of conventional single-junction PSCs made from PCBM,33,34 approaching 1 V for both PR2F and PR1F devices, which can be attributed to the low lying HOMO energy level induced by the substitution of F onto the polymer backbone.32

To corroborate the measured JSC results, the EQE of the PSCs based on polymer:PC61BM (1:1.5, w/w) with and without SVA was measured under monochromatic light, as shown in Fig. 6b. All devices without SVA exhibited a response range from 300 to 700 nm, with a maximum EQE value of 0.43 at 600 nm. Moreover, SVA enabled a significant improvement in the EQE in the wavelength range of 300–700 nm. The device with PR2F showed substantially higher photoresponse than that with PR1F, which contributed a lot to the high JSC and stronger film absorption. The JSC of PR2F:PC61BM and PR1F:PC61BM with SVA estimated by the integration of the EQE spectrum agrees with the values obtained from the J–V measurements (Table 2).
3.4. Charge transport properties
High charge carrier mobility and balanced charge-carrier transport are very important for high performance photovoltaic materials in PSCs.35,36 To compare their hole and electron transport properties, we first investigated vertical transport in blend films using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model and the hole-only and electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC61BM/MoO3/Al and ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC61BM/LiF/Al were fabricated,20 respectively. As shown in Fig. 7, the hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) were estimated to be 1.46 × 10−3 and 2.09 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PR2F:PC61BM blend, and 4.05 × 10−5 and 7.74 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PR1F:PC61BM blend. The relatively high and balanced charge carrier mobilities of the PR2F-based device indicate that the generated electrons and holes are transferred efficiently in the active blend layer, thus giving rise to a higher JSC and FF than those of the PR1F-based device.37,38

We also measured the fraction of absorbed photons in blend thin films based on PR2F and PR1F (Fig. 8a). It can be observed that the PR2F:PC61BM blend film showed the stronger absorption intensity from 300 to 660 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were analyzed to study the charge transfer behavior within the blend films. The emission spectra of the pure polymers and the polymer:PC61BM blend films are obtained and shown in Fig. 8b. The pure PR2F and PR1F films exhibited a strong PL response compared with the polymer blend with PC61BM ranging from 650 to 850 nm with the main peaks at 710 and 725 nm, respectively. Upon blending with PC61BM, the PL emission peaks of the polymers were obviously quenched, suggesting that efficient photo induced charge transfer occurs in the film, which was a prerequisite for achieving high photovoltaic performance.

3.5. Morphology study
The surface morphology of the photoactive layers was studied by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 9 shows the height and phase images of the as-cast and SVA PR2F:PC61BM and PR1F:PC61BM blend films. Both the PR2F:PC61BM and PR1F:PC61BM blend films exhibit a well-developed interconnected network with a nanoscale fibril structure. The AFM images in Fig. 9 demonstrate that the SVA produced PR2F:PC61BM and PR1F:PC61BM films with rather smooth surfaces, accompanied by a reduction in the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness from 7.08 to 3.59 nm for PR2F:PC61BM and from 8.34 to 5.65 nm for PR1F:PC61BM. It is believed that such a morphological change can facilitate charge separation and collection.37

4. Conclusions
In this work, based on two asymmetric fluorinated BT-T units constructing D–A polymers, we reported two regio-asymmetric polymer donor materials PR2F and PR1F with three repeat units A–D–A, π–D–A, and π–D–π along the polymer backbone and evaluated the photovoltaic performance in fullerene solar cells. The results showed that both the regio-asymmetric polymers had a low lying HOMO energy level and then exhibited a high VOC of ∼1 V in both PR2F and PR1F devices. The relatively higher and balanced charge carrier mobilities of the PR2F-based device gave rise to a higher JSC and FF than those of the PR1F-based device. The PR2F:PC61BM based devices exhibited the best efficiency with a superior PCE of 4.73%, a VOC of 0.98 V, and an improved JSC of 10.01 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.48. These results indicate that the regio-asymmetric conjugated polymers are a promising class of materials for PSC applications, and it is significant to further understand the influence of the polymer structure on the optoelectronic properties.
