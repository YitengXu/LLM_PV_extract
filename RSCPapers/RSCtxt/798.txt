    , Accepted 21st September 2012First published on 24th September 2012AbstractTo explore the synergistic effects of polyoxometalate and noble metal nanoparticles on the photovoltaic performance of titanium dioxide (TiO2), multilayer film photoanodes consisting of TiO2 nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles (Au) and Dawson-type polyoxometalate K6P2W18O62 (abbr. as P2W18) have been prepared by the layer-by-layer self-assembly method, and poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) was used as a film forming auxiliary material. These film electrodes were characterized by UV-vis spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and photoelectrochemical measurements. Transient photocurrent and current–voltage curve measurements demonstrate that the photocurrent response and power conversion efficiency increase in the sequence: the TiO2 film < the P2W18/TiO2 film < the TiO2/P2W18/Au film. These results provide valuable information for photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical applications.
1. Introduction
In recent years, with the growing requirements in global renewable energy, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been widely studied as alternatives for the generation of electricity from sunlight due to their efficiency and cost effectiveness. So far, the best conversion efficiency which has been reported by Grätzel's group is about 12.3%.1–4 As a core component in DSSCs, titania (TiO2) is a widely employed wide-band-gap semiconductor material that, because of its intriguing physical and chemical properties as well as its abundance, low cost, and relative nontoxicity, has received considerable attention. Generally, TiO2 could well absorb ultraviolet radiation to produce photoexcited charge carriers, but both high electron–hole recombination rate and low photogenerated charge transfer rate limit the light-to-electricity conversion efficiency.5,6 Besides other secondary parts, the power conversion efficiency enhancement of TiO2 photoanode should be a vital factor for realizing commercial production of DSSCs. To solve these problems, various strategies have been attempted, including morphological control, metal modification, combination with other materials, etc.7,8
Polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of metal–oxygen nanoclusters with remarkable structural diversity and variety of chemical composition, have shown unique physicochemical properties and various applications.9,10 POM anions are good electron acceptors and have the ability to promote electron transfer rate of the semiconductor conduction band (CB) by trapping photogenerated electrons. Incorporation of POMs into semiconductors could retard effectively the fast electron–hole recombination. Especially, Dawson-type POMs are well investigated for their strong oxidation power. Their general formulas are expressed as [X2M18O62]6− (X = P, Si, Ge…; M = W, Mo), where X is generally called a heteroatom, and the anionic structure is shown in Fig. 1.11

In the past decade, noble metals have been the subject of active research due to their special optical and electronic properties.12–14 Modification of electrodes with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) has attracted increasing attention for promoting electric conductivity.15,16 Au@TiO2 core–shell hollow spheres were reported by Wang and Tang's group and used as the photoanodes of DSSCs to increase cell efficiency.17 Tarr and coworkers demonstrated that Au–TiO2 nanowires exhibited enhancement in electron transport rate compared to untreated TiO2 nanotubes.18
Recently, our group reported that the incorporation of POMs into phthalocyanine electrodes can effectively enhance its photovoltaic performance.19 We also fabricated CdS/POMs nanocomposite films which showed great photoelectrochemical performance.20 These above-mentioned results inspired us to combine AuNPs with POMs to create a synergistic effect on the photovoltaic performance of TiO2 photoanodes, considering both the high electron mobility from AuNPs and the high electron–hole separation efficiency from POMs.
In this work, we incorporated Dawson-type polyoxometalate (K6P2W18O62, denoted as P2W18) and Au nanoparticles into TiO2 nanocomposite films by using the layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly method, and investigated the photoelectrochemical performance of the films. This work demonstrates for the first time that both photocurrent response and power conversion efficiency increase in the sequence: the TiO2 film < the TiO2/Au film < the P2W18/TiO2 film < the TiO2/P2W18/Au film. Such a result is in accordance with our expectation and is also understandable as illustrated in Fig. 2. In addition, the research on photoelectrochemical oxidation of methanol in this work also supports the above conclusion. This work provides a new strategy to further enhance the photovoltaic performance of TiO2 in solar cell applications.

2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
P2W18 was prepared according to a literature method and identified by UV-vis adsorption spectra and cyclic voltammetry.21 The preparation and characterization were described briefly in the ESI (Fig. S1 and S2†). TiO2 colloidal nanoparticles were synthesized by hydrolysis of tetraisopropyl titanate according to the reported procedure.22,23 The crystal structure was anatase, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Fig. S3 in ESI†). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shows that the mean size of the particles was ca. 8 nm (Fig. S4 in ESI†).
To prepare PEI-capped AuNPs, an aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (25 ml, 1 mM) was mixed with 1% (w/w) PEI (polyethylenimine branched, Mw = 25 kDa) and then stirred vigorously at room temperature for 24 h.24 The nanoparticles were separated by high speed centrifugation, washed twice with water and finally redispersed in water. As shown in Fig. 3A, the absorption band of the resulting AuNPs appeared at about 520 nm in the UV-vis spectrum, which confirmed the formation of AuNPs under the assistance of PEI. The hydrodynamic diameter of PEI-capped AuNPs in pure water was measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS), and showed an average diameter of ≈28.85 nm with relatively narrow distribution (polydispersity index (PDI) = 0.337, Fig. 3B). TEM image (Fig. 3C) showed the morphologies of PEI-capped AuNPs, and the diameter of the nanoparticles observed by TEM was in good agreement with the DLS measurement. As expected, the AuNPs were positively charged and the zeta potential was 15.2 mV (Fig. 3D), which suggested that PEI was successfully introduced onto the surface of the AuNPs.

3-Aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APS) and PSS (Mw = 70000) were purchased from Aldrich and used without further treatment. Other reagent were of AR grade. The water used in all experiments was deionized to a resistivity of 18 MΩ cm.
2.2. Preparation of the composite film
The fabrication of the multilayer film electrode was schematically illustrated in Fig. 4 and was carried out according to the following steps. Quartz substrates, silicon wafers (Si〈100〉, polished on one side), and indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass were cleaned according to a literature procedure.25 APS-modified substrates were immersed into HCl (pH = 2.0) for 20 min to get an amino cation surface, followed by washing with deionized water and drying in nitrogen.

To obtain (P2W18/TiO2)2 thin films, the substrate-supported precursor films were alternately dipped into the P2W18 (1 × 10−3 M in pH = 1.5 HNO3) solution and the TiO2 colloidal dispersion for 10 min and 1 min, respectively, then rinsed with deionized water after each dipping. For the (P2W18/TiO2/P2W18/Au)2 films, the precursor films were dipped into solution in the order of P2W18, TiO2, P2W18 and AuNPs solution for 10, 1, 10 and 4 min, respectively. Finally, the samples were heated at 80 °C for 6 h to establish electrical contact among the nanoparticles. For comparison, (PSS/TiO2)2 films and (PSS/TiO2/PSS/Au)2 thin films were prepared in a similar way.
2.3. Thin film characterization
UV-vis absorption spectra of the quartz-supported films were recorded on a 756CRT UV-visible spectrophotometer after each layer deposition. AFM measurements were performed in air with a SPI3800N Probe Station. XPS were measured on silicon wafers using an ESCALAB MK II Surface Analysis System (including X-ray photoelectron spectrometer) with aluminium Kα (1486.6 eV) as X-ray source. A concentric hemispherical analyser (CHA) was used with 50 eV pass energy, and the XPS analysis depth was 3–5nm.
2.4. Photoelectrochemical measurements
All photoelectrochemical experiments were performed on a CHI660C Electrochemical Workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Corp., China) at room temperature. Linear sweep voltammetry was used to obtain current–voltage (I–V) curves. A three-electrode system was employed in a quartz cell with an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) electrode as the reference electrode, a platinum foil as the counter electrode, and the composite film-assembled ITO glass as the working electrode. All photocurrent transient experiments were carried out at a constant bias of 0 V. A 300 W xenon lamp was used as a light source, and the average intensity for UV radiation that reaching the composite films was measured to be ca. 1.12 × 103 μW cm−2. The illumination area of working electrode was set constant at 1.8 × 1.0 cm2. All photoelectrochemical measurements were done in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte which was exposed to air.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. UV-vis spectra characterization of the multilayer films
UV-vis spectroscopy was used to monitor the LbL adsorption process. In an acid solution, the Coulomb force adsorbed negatively charged P2W18, positively charged TiO2 and AuNPs with each other. Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the (P2W18/TiO2/P2W18/Au)2 multilayers assembled on a precursor-coated quartz substrate (on both sides). Both P2W18 and TiO2 possess absorption bands in the UV region, the characteristic bands of P2W18 at 201 and 295 nm increased linearly with the number of layers, and the inset of Fig. 5 shows the plots of the absorbance values at 201 nm. The absorption band of AuNPs was not seen at 520 nm for the low adsorption quantity. A similar behavior was observed for PSS/TiO2 multilayer films.

(Inset) relationship of absorbance at 201 nm after P2W18 deposition vs. the number of layers. 
3.2. X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS)
XPS spectra were used to identify the chemical composition and the binding energy of the (P2W18/TiO2/P2W18/Au)2 film on silicon substrates. Fig. 6 shows the signal peaks of P, W, Ti, and Au in the film which confirmed the presence of these elements. The peaks of W 4f and P 2p were detected at 35.4, 37.4 and 132.7 eV, which also gave an approximate ratio of phosphorous to tungsten in 1:9 for P2W18. The Ti 2p peak was observed at 458.7 and 464.6 eV, corresponding to Ti4+ of TiO2. There is a Au 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 doublet with the binding energies of 83.3 and 87.1 eV, respectively. These values suggest unambiguously that gold is present in the LbL film in the metallic form.26 These results indicate that P2W18, TiO2, and Au nanoparticles are indeed incorporated into the composite film.

3.3. Morphology of the film
AFM can provide detailed information about the surface morphology and homogeneity of the deposited film. Fig. 7 shows AFM images of the (PSS/TiO2)2 film (A), the (P2W18/TiO2)2 film (B), and the (P2W18/TiO2/P2W18/Au)2 film (C). All samples show typical spherical or granular patterns similar to other classes of TiO2-deposited LbL films.27 Such a morphologic feature is due to the aggregation behavior of TiO2 colloidal nanoparticles.28Fig. 7A shows that TiO2 nanoparticles have a size of ca. 53.6 nm, the mean interface roughness is 5.47 nm. Fig. 7B shows nanoparticles coagulated into larger scale agglomerates which are approximately 83.9 nm, and the interface roughness is 5.51 nm. Correspondingly, we can get the size and mean interface roughness of nanoparticles in Fig. 7C which are 52.0 nm and 4.68 nm respectively. In addition, a vertical grain structure of the multilayer surface can be observed from three-dimensional AFM images which show that the distribution of aggregated clusters is almost uniform.

3.4. Photocurrent transient measurement
To investigate the photoelectrochemical performance of the LbL films, photocurrent transient experiments have been carried out at a constant bias of 0 V under Xe lamp irradiation in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Fig. 8 shows the photocurrent changes of the (PSS/TiO2)2 film (a), the (P2W18/TiO2)2 film (b), the (P2W18/TiO2/P2W18/Au)2 film (c), and the (PSS/TiO2/PSS/Au)2 film (d) when the irradiation is switched on and off. All the samples represent fast anodic photocurrent responses. We observed a intense increase in the photocurrent of the (P2W18/TiO2/P2W18/Au)2 film as compared to that of the (P2W18/TiO2)2 film, the (PSS/TiO2/PSS/Au)2 film and the (PSS/TiO2)2 film. In the case that the surface coverage of TiO2 in these three films are close, it can be considered that P2W18 improved the inherent photoelectrochemical response of TiO2 as an efficient electron scavenger, while the gold nanoparticles help to augment photocurrent for the excellent electric conductivity. These results demonstrate that photocurrent generation significantly depends on the components of the LbL films.
 Fig. 8  Photocurrent responses of (a) the (PSS/TiO2)2 film, (b) the (P2W18/TiO2)2 film, (c) the (P2W18/TiO2/P2W18/Au)2 film, and (d) the (PSS/TiO2/PSS/Au)2 film in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. 

Fig. 9 displays the anodic photocurrent responses for (P2W18/TiO2/P2W18/Au)n (n = 1–3) films with different numbers of layers, the photocurrent increases gradually with the number of layers. This increase can be attributed to more TiO2 nanoparticles absorbing the UV light and injecting electrons, and simultaneously, Au nanoparticles can help to expedite the electron transfer. However, the photocurrent of the (P2W18/TiO2)3 film is somewhat lower than that of (P2W18/TiO2)2 film (Fig. S5†), which results from the slower electron transfer rates from the film to the ITO electrode as the number of layers increases.29 In addition, the particles adsorbed in the outer part of the ITO also hinder the light penetration. When the film thickness is bigger than the light penetration depth, the film far from the light source can absorb few incident photons.30 The relationship between layer-number and photocurrent of the (PSS/TiO2)2 films and the (PSS/TiO2/PSS/Au)2 thin films (ESI, Fig. S6 and S7†) could thus be explained in the same way. These results indicated that the photoelectrical properties of the LbL films are dependent on film thickness.

3.5. Current–voltage (I–V) curves
To further investigate the photoelectron-conversion efficiency of the LbL films, the I–V curves (Fig. 10) for the (PSS/TiO2)2 film (a), the (P2W18/TiO2)2 film (b), the (P2W18/TiO2/P2W18/Au)2 film (c), and the (PSS/TiO2/PSS/Au)2 film (d) have been measured upon illumination. The (PSS/TiO2)2 film shows a power conversion efficiency (η) of 0.0042% with short-circuit current (Jsc) = 0.35 μA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) = 0.32 V, and fill factor (ff) = 0.42. The (PSS/TiO2/PSS/Au)2 film has a power conversion efficiency of η = 0.0079% with Jsc = 0.99 μA cm−2, Voc = 0.33 V, and ff = 0.28. For the (P2W18/TiO2)2 film, the I–V curve exhibits a Jsc of 1.16 μA cm−2 with an Voc of 0.25 V, an ff of 0.33, and a power conversion efficiency of η = 0.0088%. In contrast, the (P2W18/TiO2/P2W18/Au)2 film has the highest power conversion efficiency of 0.014% with Jsc = 1.53 μA cm−2, Voc = 0.27 V, and ff = 0.38. The fill factor (ff) and power conversion efficiency (η%) were calculated using the short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage.31 ff = (JmaxVmax)/(JscVoc)(1) η = Pout/Pin = ff(JscVoc)/Pin(2)
 Fig. 10  Current–voltage curves of (a) the (PSS/TiO2)2 film, (b) the (P2W18/TiO2)2 film, (c) the (P2W18/TiO2/P2W18/Au)2 film, and (d) the (PSS/TiO2/PSS/Au)2 under Xe lamp irradiation. 
Obviously, the (P2W18/TiO2/P2W18/Au)2 film displays a much higher power conversion efficiency than the others, which is consistent with the results of the photocurrent transient measurements. The (P2W18/TiO2)2 film exhibits a higher photocurrent response and η than the (PSS/TiO2)2 film, indicating that P2W18 should play the role of an efficient electron shuttle between the TiO2 CB and the ITO electrode. The redox potential of P2W18 and the CB level of TiO2 are +0.34 and −0.5 V versus NHE, respectively (Fig. 2),32 thus suggesting that electron transfer from the TiO2 CB to P2W18 is a favorable exothermic process. Furthermore, the photoexcited electron on the POM could also be transferred to AuNPs depending on energy level matching. By means of the electron acceptor characteristic, POMs could effectively block the fast electron–hole recombination on the surface of TiO2. For the (P2W18/TiO2)2 film, P2W18 is thus crucial in improving the photoelectrochemical performance by retarding the fast electron–hole recombination. However, when the LbL film is fabricated with PSS and TiO2, the photocurrent response and η only depend on the inherent properties of TiO2.
Actually, AuNPs in the (P2W18/TiO2/P2W18/Au)2 film act as an electron conductor junction for promoting the interfacial electron transfer into the outside of electrode. Through the deposition of AuNPs onto the semiconductor surface, a Schottky barrier can be created at the metal–semiconductor junction to limit the phenomenon of electron–hole recombination.33,34 Upon photoexcitation of a metal–semiconductor system, the difference in the Fermi levels of metal and metal oxide could conduct the continuous electron transfer.35 Depending on energy level matching, the electrons transferred from TiO2 to POMs will transfer sequentially from POMs to the AuNPs. In addition, the AuNPs play the role to promote the electron transfer on the electrode; the photoelectrochemical performance of the composite film should in principle be enhanced on the basis of the composition of metal nanoparticles.
The photoelectric conversion mechanism of the composite films could be explained by the following processes: first, the band-gap excitation from the valence band to the CB of TiO2 under illumination, second, electron transfer from the CB of TiO2 to P2W18, and then to AuNPs. The electron transfer to AuNPs can expedite the transmission rate. In other words, the photogenerated electrons of TiO2 can be extracted and transferred to P2W18 and Au nanoparticles, which effectively retards the fast charge pair recombination. Therefore, films which combine POMs and noble metals should be a new strategy to enhance the photovoltaic response.
4. Conclusions
POM/TiO2/POM/Au composite films were successfully fabricated by the LbL self assembly method. The P2W18/TiO2 film shows a higher photocurrent and η than the PSS/TiO2 film due to the retarding of fast charge pair recombination by POMs. The P2W18/TiO2/P2W18/Au film demonstrated the highest photocurrent and power conversion efficiency than the others, because the AuNPs could promote the electron transfer rate. Simultaneously, the P2W18/TiO2/P2W18/Au film also exhibited significant photoelectrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation (Fig. S8 in ESI†), which is in agreement with the synergistic effects of P2W18 and AuNPs. Although the overall efficiency is not remarkable, this work demonstrates the synergistic effect for the first time that the rational combination of POMs with metal nanoparticles could enhance the photovoltaic performance of TiO2, which is potentially useful in many applications including photocatalysis, solar photovoltaic cells, and water splitting devices.
