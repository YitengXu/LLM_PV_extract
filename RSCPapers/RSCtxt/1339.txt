    , Accepted 9th May 2023First published on 10th May 2023AbstractBis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) that could work as dopants to modify the hole transport layer (HTL) have been widely used for constructing high-efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, these dopants usually suffer from the drawback of environmental sensitivity, significantly degrading photovoltaic performance. Here, to solve this issue, we used tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF) p-type dopant to prepare a high-quality HTL of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N,-di-p-methylphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-TTB). The doping process between BCF and Spiro-TTB through electron transfer was studied on the basis of Lewis acid and Brønsted acid doping. Interestingly, the water molecule promoted Spiro-TTB protonation for high-efficiency doping, then Brønsted-acid-doped Spiro-TTB yielded a high hole mobility (1.22 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1). The corresponding PSC achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.86% based on a 1.65 eV bandgap perovskite, while a four-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell yielded a superior PCE of 27.82%. The modified devices also presented much higher long-term stability under various conditions, maintaining 92% of their original PCEs after storage for over 1500 h in 25 ± 5% RH ambient air, and 93% of their original PCE after 350 h at 85 °C under an N2 atmosphere without encapsulation. Therefore, these results demonstrated that Brønsted acid doping is a promising and low-cost approach to construct efficient doped HTLs for high-performance PSCs.
1. Introduction
Recently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been considered as promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaic (PV) solar cells. Regular PSCs with a perovskite absorber in combination with an electron-transporting layer (ETL) and a hole-transporting layer (HTL) have produced a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.7%.1–5 Among numerous HTL materials, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) and its derivatives, due to high conductivity with dopants and energy level matching, are still recognized as the most efficient materials for constructing high-efficiency PSCs. Commonly-used dopants include bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI), tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine)cobalt(III) (FK102), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP)6,7 However, Li-TFSI is hygroscopic, which is likely to induce the crystallization of HTL under heating, easily diffusing into the adjacent functional layers, and thus degrading device performance.8,9 Because of its low boiling point, t-BP easily volatilizes to leave many pinholes in the HTL, decreasing a device's ambient stability.10–13 Thus, this becomes a major obstacle to the commercialization of large-scale PSCs, despite an efficiency that has been very close to the record PCE of industrial silicon solar cells.
As an effective strategy to promote the performance of the HTL, dopants could modify the HTL materials to improve their properties with higher doping concentration and mobility.11,16 Many dopants, including F4TCNQ, CuSCN, and CuI2, are used to improve HTL properties; however, they show weak doping efficiency.14,15 Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF) as a Lewis acid can employ strong π-electron acceptors to be a prominent p-type dopant of an HTL, due to its high Lewis acidity, thermal stability, and toleration of water and oxygen.17,18 The hole mobility of BCF-doped poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) increases to 5.72 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, one order of magnitude higher than that of BCF-free PTAA. As a result, a PSC with BCF-doped PTAA realizes a high PCE of 19%, much higher than that of a normal Li-TFSI/t-BP-doped PTAA device.19,20 In addition, the BCF-doped Spiro-OMeTAD device achieves an efficiency of 20.13%, which is the highest efficiency among BCF dopants.21 Moreover, BCF-doping could also increase the hole density/mobility and conductivity of poly[(2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)phenylene)-alt-(5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c]-[1,2,5]thiadiazole)] (PPDT2FBT), poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and other p-type organic semiconductors (OSCs).22–24 In the doping process, an electron is partially transferred from the π-electron system of an OSC to the BCF molecule, forming a molecular complex when an OSC shares its lone-pair electrons with the B atom of BCF.18 According to the integer charge-transfer model, if there is full electron transfer, a positive OSC cation and a negative BCF anion are formed.22 Furthermore, BCF can act as a stronger Brønsted acid to easily form BCF(OH2) Lewis complexes with H2O.25 Brønsted acid doping is proposed: BCF(OH2) first protonates a polymer chain, and this protonated chain accepts an electron from a second chain, which will undergo subsequent reactions.26 Another complication is that BCF can react with decamethylferrocene and ferrocene as reductants under ambient O2 to form the (BCF-O2–BCF)− peroxide.27 These possible reactions complicate the determination of the precise doping mechanism, resulting in different qualities of OSCs. It is very important to satisfy HTL requirements (energy level, hole conductivity, stability, etc.) for application in PSCs.
In this work, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N,-di-p-methylphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-TTB) was used as the HTL to prepare semi-transparent (ST) PSCs and tandem solar cells. First, the electron transfer process between Spiro-TTB and BCF molecules was studied to understand the doping mechanism of Lewis acid and Brønsted acid. In particular, Spiro-TTB was protonated by BCF–H2O complex to cause a subsequent electron transfer in the process of Brønsted acid doping. Second, we comparatively evaluated the film properties of Lewis-acid- and Brønsted-acid-doped Spiro-TTB (labelled Spiro-TTB:LA and Spiro-TTB:BA, respectively). The Spiro-TTB film doped with Brønsted acid had a higher doping concentration, higher electrical conductivity, and a well-matched interface energy level between the HTL and perovskite. The Spiro-TTB:BA-based PSCs achieved a particularly high PCE of 20.86% with a 1.65 eV bandgap perovskite, which is one of highest PCEs reported for wide-bandgap (>1.63 eV) PSCs without TFSI-Li. Furthermore, its four-terminal (4T) perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell achieved 27.82% PCE. Furthermore, the Spiro-TTB:BA-based devices presented excellent stability under various operating and storage conditions, due to their hydrophobicity and thermostability.
2. Results and discussion
The BCF doping process in Spiro-TTB is first systematically investigated. The chlorobenzene solution of BCF is colourless and transparent, and then becomes pink after adding some water, indicating the formation of a BCF–water complex (Fig. 1a and S1a†). The 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of BCF in Fig. 1c presents three typical peaks at −131, −149, and −161 ppm, corresponding to the ortho-, para-, and meta-fluorine resonances of pentafluorobenzene groups, respectively.28,29 Compared to the BCF solution, the featured peaks of the BCF–water complex are shifted significantly, located at −135, −153, and −162 ppm corresponding to the ortho-, para-, and meta-fluorine resonances. This can be attributed to various deprotonated BCF–water complexes in dynamic equilibrium (BCF–μOH–BCF− ⇌ BCF + BCF–OH−, BCF–OH–H2O–BCF− ⇌ BCF–H2O + BCF–OH−) and BCF·nH2O (n = 1, 2, or 3).29,30 The possible doping mechanism of Spiro-TTB is described in Fig. 1b. Lewis acid doping occurs in the light yellow Spiro-TTB which turns brown (Fig. S1b†). The boron atom of BCF hybridizes with the leading orbital of the nitrogen atom in Spiro-TTB to form the Lewis acid–base adduct (Spiro-TTB:LA). The Spiro-TTB molecule shares its lone electron pair with the boron atom of BCF that usually is inadequate charge-transfer, verified by the featured 19F peaks of BCF/Spiro-TTB only showing a change in density (Fig. S2†).31 However, the addition of BCF and water into the Spiro-TTB solution make it dark brown, induced by Brønsted acid doping. One Brønsted acid protonates a nitrogen atom of Spiro-TTB, subsequently transferring electrons from the neutral segments to the protonated segments of Spiro-TTB with positive charge. Interestingly, the F atoms split into multiple resonance peaks, indicating that this situation restricts the rotation of BCF molecules to directly bind to the nitrogen atoms of Spiro-TTB (Fig. S2†). Furthermore, electron spin resonance (ESR) is used to prove that the Brønsted acid doping is more effective in producing more unpaired electrons in Spiro-TTB:BA (Fig. S3†).

(d) FTIR transmittance spectra of undoped Spiro-TTB, Spiro-TTB:BA and Spiro-TTB:LA films. 
To gain further insight into the doping reactions of BCF and Spiro-TTB, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to determine the changes in the chemical bonds of the films. After BCF doping, there are typical peaks of stretching frequencies of B–C and F–C bonds in the 900–1000 cm−1 and 1100–1200 cm−1 regions, respectively (Fig. 1d). The stretching frequencies in the 1200–1400 cm−1 and 1400–1600 cm−1 regions can be individually attributed to the C–O and C–N bonds, and aromatic CC bonds of Spiro-TTB molecules. Interestingly, the peak intensity of CC bonds at 1509 cm−1 is obviously reduced, and the electron cloud of the aromatic ring is redistributed to affect the stretching of the vibration band after the doping reaction.32 Additionally, Brønsted-acid-doped Spiro-TTB has the lowest absorption intensity at 1509 cm−1, indicating that electron transfer is more efficient in the doping process. It is worth noting that the vibration band of 1562 cm−1 is related to the stretching frequency of B–OH, confirming the presence of BCF(OH2) and BCF–OH− anions. Analysis of the FTIR spectra indicates that Spiro-TTB:LA and Spiro-TTB:BA have different doping species, agreeing well with the results of the NMR analysis. Furthermore, these three types of Spiro-TTB film have similar optical properties, and the films with only BCF present very small peaks at 450 nm (Fig. S4†).
After the doping reaction, the electrical properties of Spiro-TTB films will be changed, which is very important for charge-carrier transport in the HTL and at the interface of HTL/perovskite. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to analyse the density of states (DOS) of Spiro-TTB doped with Lewis acid and Brønsted acid in Fig. 2a. The secondary electron cutoff (Ecutoff) and onset energy (Ei) are deduced from the UPS spectra, so that the work function (WF) of films with Spiro-TTB:LA and Spiro-TTB:BA are determined to be 4.59 and 4.87 eV, respectively. In addition, the measurement results of contact potential difference (CPD) between the conductive tip and the sample using a Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM) are used to analyse the WF change in Fig. 2b. The average CPD values of Spiro-TTB:LA and Spiro-TTB:BA samples are 0.64 and 0.39 V, respectively. The lower CPD value with a darker KPFM image of Spiro-TTB:BA lead to a higher WF, in correspondence with the results of UPS. The higher WF of Spiro-TTB:BA has a deeper Fermi level, due to the higher doping concentration from the Brønsted acid. The CPD distributions of the samples are very narrow, indicating that the doping reactions are relatively uniform in both Spiro-TTB films in Fig. 2c. Furthermore, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of Spiro-TTB can be calculated from the equation: HOMO = −(hν − Ecutoff + Ei), where hv is the photon energy. The calculated HOMOs of Spiro-TTB:LA and Spiro-TTB:BA are −5.22 and −5.29 eV, respectively. As a function of the photonic bandgap of Spiro-TTB films, the energy level diagrams of the devices are presented in Fig. 1d. With the presence of water in the doping reaction, Spiro-TTB:BA presents a more moderate energy level gradient to promote hole extraction between perovskite and HTL.

(d) Energy level diagrams of PSCs extracted from UPS spectra. (e) c-AFM images and (f) the corresponding current distributions of Spiro-TTB:BA and Spiro-TTB:LA films. 
With different doping concentrations, Spiro-TTB films will display different electrical conductivities. The variation in electrical conductivity was measured by conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) in Fig. 2e. The average electric current of Spiro-TTB:BA is 16.40 pA, almost 3 times as large as that of Spiro-TTB:LA (5.88 pA). Because the hole concentration will obviously increase with BCF-doping, especially for Brønsted acid doping, the conductivities of BCF-doped Spiro-TTB films are enhanced significantly. Additionally, the hole mobility of Spiro-TTB:BA is 1.22 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, twice that of Spiro-TTB:LA, and nearly 30 times that of pristine Spiro-TTB (Table S1†). However, the statistical current distribution of Spiro-TTB:BA is wider than that of Spiro-TTB:LA in Fig. 2f, probably owing to the different doping efficiencies from the water being dispersed nonuniformly in the chlorobenzene solution. In particular, there also are some regions of higher conductivity in Spiro-TTB:BA, larger than 40 pA. The current–voltage (I–V) curves of the Spiro-TTB films were further measured in the structure of Ag/HTL/ITO, in which the Spiro-TTB:BA film of the same thickness has the smallest resistance in Fig. S5,† in accordance with the results of c-AFM. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were used to analyse the charge-carrier transport and recombination characteristics of BCF-doped Spiro-TTB films coated on a perovskite layer in Fig. S6 and S7,† respectively. These HTLs can effectively extract the holes from the light absorption layer, whereas the Spiro-TTB:BA film displays much quicker hole extraction. Meanwhile, there is a long carrier lifetime in the Spiro-TTB:BA/perovskite, due to better field-effect passivation from the more suitable energy level compared to that of Spiro-TTB:LA.33 Therefore, the Spiro-TTB:BA HTL shows higher hole collection efficiency in the device.
The influence of the doping reaction in Spiro-TTB film on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs was systematically studied, based on the regular device structure (Fig. S8†). When the Lewis-acid-doped Spiro-TTB consisted of 3 mg of BCF and 36 mg of Spiro-TTB, the Spiro-TTB:LA based PSC showed the highest PCE (Fig. S9†). The most-efficient Spiro-TTB:BA-based device was produced when Spiro-TTB was doped with BCF–water complexes of Brønsted acid, including 0.2 μL mL−1 water and BCF 3 mg mL−1 (Fig. S10†). The water is first reacted with BCF to become a Brønsted acid which has optimized doping efficiency for HTL without a competing reaction (Fig. S11 and Table S3†). After exploring the optimal contents of dopants, the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of Spiro-TTB:LA- and Spiro-TTB:BA-based PSCs with a 1.65 eV bandgap perovskite (1.4 M FA0.82Cs0.13MA0.05Pb(I0.80Br0.20)3) are presented in Fig. 3a. (The statistical distributions of the parameters are plotted in Fig. S12.†) The Spiro-TTB:LA-based device achieves a champion PCE of 18.72% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.09 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 21.59 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 79.55%. With higher p-doping efficiency, the Spiro-TTB:BA-based device presents a significantly enhanced VOC (1.15 V) and FF (82.33%), leading to a higher PCE of 20.86%, which is one of highest efficiencies among those reported for wide-bandgap (>1.63 eV) PSCs based on non-lithium-salt-doped HTL (Table S2†).

(c) VOC as a function of light intensity, (d) Nyquist plots, (e) Mott–Schottky plots, and (f) TPV curves of the samples based on Spiro-TTB:BA and Spiro-TTB:LA, respectively. 
To further analyse the relationship between photovoltaic performance and hole transport/recombination in HTLs, the electrical properties of PSCs were investigated in detail. The space charge limiting current (SCLC) was measured at different bias voltages with the hole-only structure of ITO/MeO-2PACz/perovskite/Spiro-TTB/Au in Fig. 3b, which was used to quantify trap density (ntrap) in PSCs. The J–V traces are divided into three regions: the ohmic region (n = 1), the trap-filled limit region (TFL, n ≥ 3), and the Child region (n = 2). The trap-filled limit voltages (VTFL) of perovskite layers covered with Spiro-TTB:LA and Spiro-TTB:BA are 0.41 and 0.46 V, respectively. The ntrap values can be deduced from VTFL with the equation: (1)where q is the elementary charge, L is the thickness of the perovskite film, and ε0 and ε are the vacuum permittivity and the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite. Thus, the value of ntrap is slightly reduced from 3.66 × 1017 cm−3 to 3.26 × 1017 cm−3, indicating that the protonated Spiro-TTB can passivate the trap defects of the perovskite surface to a certain extent. The light intensity dependence of VOC was also used to analyse the trap-assisted recombination process from the deep-level trap states in Fig. 3c. The curve slopes are 1.75 and 1.51 for the Spiro-TTB:LA- and Spiro-TTB:BA-based PSCs, which represent the photo-generated charge carriers to be recombined by trap states. Thus, with Brønsted acid doping, the Spiro-TTB film has fewer trap states compared to Lewis acid doping.
Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measured at a bias of 0.9 V under simulated AM1.5G illumination in Fig. 3d, was used to further understand the interfacial charge transfer and recombination processes in the PSCs. The Nyquist plots with one semi-circle reflect the resistance of charge recombination (Rrec) at the interfaces of the device, and the inset is an equivalent circuit model. A lower value means that carriers are much more easily recombined. The fitted Rrec values are 133.2 Ω and 159.5 Ω for the Spiro-TTB:LA- and Spiro-TTB:BA-based PSCs, respectively, indicating that Spiro-TTB:BA can effectively restrain the recombination of charge carriers compared with Spiro-TTB:LA at the interface of HTL/perovskite. Fitting the Mott–Schottky curves shows that the Spiro-TTB:BA-based PSC has an improved built-in potential (Vbi) of 0.98 V, higher than the 0.93 V of the Spiro-TTB:LA-based PSC in Fig. 3e. A higher Vbi provides a larger driving force for the separation of photo-generated charge carriers, which more effectively restrains electron–hole recombination in the depletion region. Transient photovoltage (TPV) under open-circuit conditions was also used to characterize the carrier recombination process in the PSCs in Fig. 3f. The carrier recombination lifetime of the Spiro-TTB:BA-based device is higher than that of the Spiro-TTB:LA-based device. A longer carrier recombination lifetime contributes to more efficient charge transfer for charge carrier collection. The above electrical characterizations suggest that the Spiro-TTB:BA HTL not only offers better hole collection from the perovskite but also more effectively inhibits the recombination losses at the interface of HTL/perovskite.
To study the influence of dopants on the stability of the device, the performance of devices with different HTLs was explored under various operating conditions in Fig. 4. Here, we used the normal Spiro-OMeTAD HTL with Li-TFSI, FK102, and t-BP dopants as the reference. Many pinholes appear in the Spiro-OMeTAD layer coated on the perovskite, due to the easy volatilization of t-BP. After exposure to air, there are additional PbI2 precipitates from the decomposition of perovskite in Fig. 4a. The moisture can easily diffuse into the perovskite layer through the pinholes, but, more seriously, Li-TFSI absorbs the water molecules to aggravate the decomposition of perovskite. Interestingly, the Spiro-TTB:BA layer is conformally coated on the perovskite and is free from pinholes in Fig. 4b. (The original SEM images are shown in Fig. S14.†) Moreover, the Spiro-TTB:BA layer can prevent the moisture from etching the perovskite layer, due to its hydrophobicity, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4g. (The contact angle of Spiro-TTB:BA is 91.54°, much larger than the 9° of the Spiro-OMeTAD layer.) The Spiro-TTB:LA layer also has conformal coverage on the perovskite and thus has a higher ability to block water diffusing into the perovskite layer, as shown in Fig. S15.† Fig. S16† presents the visual change in perovskite with different HTLs after storage in air. From the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of Fig. 4c and d, the δ phase of yellow perovskite obviously appears in the Spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite after exposing it to air for 48 h. The perovskite layers with Spiro-TTB:LA and Spiro-TTB:BA retain the crystalline structure of the α phase, even after 672 h, as shown in Fig. S17.† There are only very few crystals of δ phase in the Spiro-TTB:LA/perovskite film; furthermore, the Spiro-TTB:BA sample still maintains the pure α phase. Thus, the Spiro-TTB:BA-based PSCs will display higher moisture stability. The unencapsulated device with Spiro-TTB:BA retains 92% of its original PCE after storing for over 1500 h in 25 ± 5% RH ambient air, much better than that of the control device (72% of the original PCE). Under other humidities the unencapsulated Spiro-TTB:BA PSC keeps 97% of its original PCE after storing for over 6648 h in an N2 atmosphere, 83% of its original PCE after 720 h in ambient air of 65–90% RH and room temperature, as shown in Fig. S18.†

(g) Long-term air stability of unencapsulated solar cells at room temperature and relative humidity of about 25 ± 5%. 
Furthermore, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) measurements were taken for the encapsulated cells under AM1.5G illumination in ambient air at 35 ± 5 °C. The Spiro-TTB:BA-based device maintains 90% of its initial PCE after a 650 h MPPT test in Fig. 4e. The thermal analyses of thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S19†) and differential scanning calorimetry (Fig. S20†) could prove that Spiro-TTB:BA and Spiro-TTB:LA have higher thermal stability than Spiro-OMeTAD. The unencapsulated Spiro-TTB:BA PSC can maintain 93% of its original PCE after 350 h at 85 °C under an N2 atmosphere, significantly higher than that of the Spiro-OMeTAD PSC in Fig. 4f. Therefore, the Spiro-TTB:BA PSC presents relatively higher stability in operation and storage under different application conditions.
Since wide-bandgap PSCs are promising top cells for tandem solar cells, we fabricated an ST Spiro-TTB:BA device to construct a four-terminal (4T) perovskite/silicon tandem device with a tunnel oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) solar cell. As in previous work, the structure of ST-PSC is composed of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/HTL/MoOx/ITO, as shown in Fig. S21.†34 This ST-PSC yields a high PCE of 19.35% with a VOC of 1.14 V, a JSC of 21.29 mA cm−2, and an FF of 79.43% in Fig. 5a, which is the record efficiency for an n–i–p device based on a wide-bandgap (>1.63 eV) perovskite (Table S5†). Meanwhile, an ST-PSC (except for the top metallic frame) was prepared as a filter with an area of 2.5 × 2.5 cm2, which was further stacked on the bottom cell using an aperture mask with dimensions of 2 × 2 cm2 for 4T measurements. The J–V curves of the silicon bottom cell and the filtered silicon solar cell below the ST-PSC are presented in Fig. 5b, and the detailed parameters are summarized in Table 1. The initial PCE of the silicon solar cell is 24.40%, decreasing to 8.47% after using the ST-PSC filter. The reduction in the JSC of the filtered silicon solar cell from 42.94 to 16.42 mA cm−2 leads to the reduced PCE, following the corresponding EQE spectra (Fig. 5c). Additionally, the reduced VOC in the bottom silicon cell is caused by a reduction in photo-induced carrier concentration. Accordingly, the champion 4T perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell represents a calculated PCE of 27.82%, and the reported efficiencies of the n–i–p 4T perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell (>25%) are summarised in Table S6.†

3. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully confirmed a BCF–water complex (Brønsted acid) as a p-type dopant to significantly enhance the doping concentration of HTL, which had a high hole mobility and a suitable energy level for efficient hole extraction. We gained a deep insight into the electron transfer between BCF and Spiro-TTB molecules, which plays a key role in doping efficiency. In comparison with pristine and Li-TFSI-doped films, the Spiro-TTB:BA HTL not only facilitated band alignment and hole collection, but also protected the perovskite from environmental etching. These attractive properties enabled a champion PCE of 19.35% for ST PSC and 27.82% for a 4T tandem solar cell based on a wide-bandgap perovskite, with better reproducibility and stability. This work provides an effective strategy for replacing Li-TFSI dopants to improve the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs, which is helpful for the development of high-efficiency and stable PSCs.
