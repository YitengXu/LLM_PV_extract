    , Accepted 6th November 2013First published on 7th November 2013AbstractA new electron acceptor poly(indacenodiselenophene-difluorobenzothiadiazole) was used to fabricate bilayer all-polymer solar cells with a high power conversion efficiency (2.5%). By using the layer-evolved bilayer structure with interfacial modification, it alleviates unbalanced charge carrier mobility and reduces bimolecular recombination within the BHJ device.
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on semiconducting polymers that can form interpenetrating networks with fullerene derivatives are the most promising ones among various device architectures to reach power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 9%.1 However, the development of PSCs has been hampered due to the lack of suitable electron-accepting and -transporting polymers, therefore only a limited number of fullerene derivatives2 with high isotropic electron mobility are used. One alternative to fullerene-based PSCs is all-polymer solar cells,3 which have potential advantages such as better light absorption due to the contribution from the acceptor polymer and higher open-circuit voltages. Among numerous n-type organic semiconductors4 that have been studied so far for non-fullerene OPVs, cyano-poly(phenylenevinylene), polyfluorene(benzo-thiadiazole), and perylenediimides have been the most promising. Nevertheless, the efficiencies of all-polymer solar cells have lagged behind those of polymer/fullerene based solar cells with the highest efficiency reaching only around 4%.5
A number of factors contribute to the low efficiency of all-polymer based devices, such as low charge carrier mobilities, strong geminate recombination, and undesirable morphologies of blends.6 Therefore, it is crucial to explore both new materials and methods that can lead to an optimal morphology and improved performance. The standard fabrication process of a BHJ polymer solar cell involves spin-casting the active layer from a solution of mixed conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives. Recently, “bilayer” solar cells have been fabricated using a process that involves the inter-diffusion of PCBM from the top layer into the bottom polymer layer via solvent effects or thermal annealing.7 These reports have demonstrated that for polymer/fullerene bilayer systems, the sequential deposition process yields a nanoscale morphology that is indistinguishable from the standard phase separated BHJ material and has a comparable or higher efficiency than conventional BHJ devices (Table 1).

In this work, we chose poly(indacenodiselenophene-difluorobenzothiadiazole) (PIDSe-DFBT) as the electron transporting material due to its high electron mobility in addition to its good device performance (6.8% when blending with PC71BM) as a donor material.8 The molecular structure of PIDSe-DFBT is shown in Fig. 1A. From the results obtained from organic field effect transistors (OFETs), n-type behaviour with an electron mobility of up to 0.057 cm2 V−1 s−1 has been observed, which is comparable to that of PC60BM (0.067 cm2 V−1 s−1) under the same conditions (Fig. S1†). Herein we show that the same conjugated polymer can operate either as an electron-acceptor or an electron-donor provided that its energy levels have the correct offsets with respect to its counterpart in the blend. This demonstrates that ambipolar conjugated polymers with high electron-mobility can be used as n-type materials in OPV devices.

(D) J–V curves of BHJ and bilayer devices with different electron-transporting layers. 
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of PIDSe-DFBT and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) are shown in Fig. 1B. The broad absorption minimum of PIDSe-DFBT is compensated for by the P3HT absorption. Thus, a nearly complete coverage of the solar spectrum from visible to near infrared (NIR) is possible in their blend. The trends in measured HOMO/LUMO energy levels of PIDSe-DFBT and P3HT materials are graphically illustrated in Fig. 2A, along with the reported HOMO/LUMO energy levels of P3HT. On the basis of the criterion of HOMO/LUMO energy levels and their offsets, ΔELUMO ∼ 0.5 eV suggests that efficient electron transfer from P3HT to PIDSe-DFBT should be feasible.9

To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the new n-type polymer, we compared two representative fabrication processes based on PIDSe-DFBT using conventional BHJ and bilayer inverted structures as presented in Fig. 1C. Details of process optimization in the device performance are described in Fig. S2.† In Fig. 1D, the photocurrent versus voltage (J–V) curves show that this BHJ device has a relatively low device efficiency of 0.99% with the following parameters: Voc = 1.13 V, Jsc = 1.34 mA cm−2, and FF = 65.70%. AFM images (Fig. S3†) show the BHJ layer with a rough surface (rms = 13.5 nm) and an inhomogeneous mixing. However, the photoluminescence (PL) quenching efficiency (∼92%) of P3HT is inconsistent with the large phase-separated morphology in the BHJ films. Such a disagreement has been reported for blends of conjugated polymers,10 suggesting that large phase-separated domains are not pure but involve a minor counterpart material. The minor counterpart isolated in the large domains just serves as a quenching site for excitons and leads to increasing recombination losses and decreasing photocurrent generation.
One alternative to avoid the poor miscibility problem in the blended film is to adopt a bilayer structure to reduce bimolecular recombination.11 Dichloromethane was chosen as an orthogonal solvent to allow the fabrication of devices without affecting the morphology of the PIDSe-DFBT film underneath, which was confirmed from the absorption spectra of the bilayer films of P3HT/PIDSe-DFBT. The performance of the bilayer devices shows an increasing Jsc value of 3.18 mA cm−2. The reduced Φq for the bilayer films is consistent with the decreased interface between the donor and the acceptor, compared to the BHJ films. Additionally, the Voc value of the bilayer inverted device decreases significantly to 0.48 V in the bilayer device using ZnO as the electron selective layer. The Voc of a BHJ solar cell is primarily determined by the difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor, as well as the work function difference between the anode and the cathode.12 For the conventional solar cell, the Ca/Al cathode provides efficient electron collection without significant losses. However, for the inverted solar cell, the mismatched energy level between the conduction band of the ZnO layer and the LUMO energy of PIDSe-DFBT creates contact resistance and causes a drop in Voc from 1.13 to 0.48 eV, which strongly limits the overall performance of the bilayer devices.
Among the various methods reported so far to improve the interface and modify the energy of the conduction band of the ZnO layer in inverted devices, the application of an organic-based interlayer as an electrode buffer has been proven to be very effective.13 Here, three representative interfacial materials were selected to improve the performance of bilayer devices, namely, self-assembled monolayer derived from C60-substituted benzoic acid (C60-COOH),14 poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN-Br),15 and 80% ethoxylatedpolyethylenimine (PEIE).16 For the ZnO layer, the ammonium and amino group in PFN-Br and PEIE both can create a dipole moment at the interface and tune the work function, respectively; while the C60-COOH can only enhance charge selectivity and reduces the charge recombination losses due to the similar LUMO level with ZnO. When a thin buffer layer of C60-COOH, PFN-Br or PEIE is cast on top of the ZnO thin film to modify the interface between the ZnO electron extraction layer and PIDSe-DFBT, all inverted devices show a slightly enhanced Jsc due to the reduce recombination at the interface. However, only the device modified with a PEIE layer shows a significantly enhanced Voc (1.13 eV), similar to that obtained in the BHJ devices, which yield an improved PCE of 2.09%.
The change in Voc can be attributed to the modified work function of the cathode after the deposition of the buffer layer. Actually, the work function of ZnO (4.5 eV) can be reduced to 3.8 eV after depositing a thin layer of PEIE.16 The neutral amine groups in PEIE create interfacial dipoles that cause a vacuum level shift of ∼0.7 eV of ZnO. To further investigate the dramatic variation in Voc when different buffer layers are used, capacitance–voltage characteristics (C–V) in Fig. 2B were obtained and the devices were analyzed based on the Mott–Schottky (MS) equation.17 The depletion zone formed at the interface can be modulated by applying a low (<1.5 V) forward bias voltage. The linear region under low forward bias is related to the formation of Schottky contact and can be fitted to a plot of C−2versus bias voltage. Extrapolation of the linear fit line to the intercept on the bias axis directly yields the built-in voltage (VBI) for the device.18 For the pristine ZnO device, a VBI of 0.60 ± 0.02 V was obtained, and the C60-COOH modified ZnO device showed a similar VBI of 0.64 ± 0.02 V. The PFN-Br/ZnO and PEIE/ZnO devices exhibit increased values of VBI to 0.96 ± 0.02 V and 1.19 ± 0.02, respectively, which match well with the trend of increased Voc. The Voc enhancement can also be observed in the inverted BHJ device using the PEIE/ZnO layer (Fig. S4†).
The light intensity dependence of the J–V characteristics (as shown in Fig. 3) in optimized inverted structure devices (PEIE/ZnO) based on BHJ films and bilayer films was investigated to probe the dominant recombination mechanism affecting device performance.19 The dependence of Jsc on the light intensity in both the BHJ and bilayer inverted devices has a similar slope (0.95). However, for the Voc dependence, the BHJ system device shows a slope of 1.05 kT q−1, which suggests that the dominant recombination mechanism is bimolecular Langevin recombination.20 In contrast, the bilayer-based solar cell shows a significantly steeper slope of 1.28 kT q−1, implying the presence of an additional trap-assisted recombination pathway.21 This apparent discrepancy can be resolved by considering the fact that recombinations of free and trapped carriers are competing processes. As a consequence, the observation of an additional trap-assisted recombination mechanism can be caused by a reduced bimolecular recombination rate.22 We further measured the carrier mobility using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model as shown in Fig. S5.† In the BHJ system, the J–V characteristics of electron-only and hole-only devices show a hole mobility (μh) of 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility (μe) of 5.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is a factor of 20 lower than the hole mobility. The unbalanced charge transport can promote Langevin recombination in this system, as it increases the electron density due to unbalanced charge transport. For the bilayer devices, the balanced mobility of holes (μh = 9.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and electrons (μe = 8.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) can be achieved by tuning the thickness of the PIDSe-DFBT layer. On the other hand, the reduced recombination rate may also be related to the improved interface morphology by changing from the bulk heterojunction to the planar interface (as the morphology shown in Fig. 4A) which enhances the Jsc. However, the effect of bilayer morphology and resulting defects remains yet to be identified.

Although we can achieve reasonable performance by using CH2Cl2 as an orthogonal solvent in the inverted bilayer devices, the poor solubility of P3HT in CH2Cl2 limits the reproducibility of device fabrication. If we mix CH2Cl2 with chlorobenzene (CB) or 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB), which can dissolve P3HT quite easily, these co-solvents can not only improve the solubility but also help form layer-evolved bilayer (LE-bilayer) devices. The images from AFM (Fig. 4) show a rougher surface morphology after spin-coating P3HT with co-solvents. The layer-evolved process is expected to cause inter-diffusion of P3HT into the bottom PIDSe-DFBT layer via swelling.7 As shown in Fig. 5A, the LE-bilayer devices using 10% CB in CH2Cl2 exhibit an improved device efficiency of 2.45% with a slight increase in both Jsc and FF.

The extent of the increase is dependent on the CB ratio in the co-solvent. Fig. 5B shows a gradual increase in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of three different fabrication processes: BHJ, bilayer, and LE-bilayer. Additionally, for the co-solvent with a high concentration of CB (20%), a decrease in Jsc was observed due to poor solvent resistance of the under-layer. The dissolution of the PIDSe-DFBT was apparent after spin-coating P3HT with CH2Cl2:CB (4:1) on top of it due to its decreased absorption intensity (Fig. S6†). Thus, if the solvent resistance of the n-type polymer can be optimized, the increased P3HT penetration may further improve device performance.
In summary, efficient all-polymer bilayer OPV devices have been demonstrated based on the use of PIDSe-DFBT for electron transport and P3HT for hole transport. High device efficiencies could be achieved by systematic optimization of each component of the all-polymer solar cells. Using the bilayer structure with a planar interface can partially alleviate the problem of poor miscibility between the two polymers to increase Jsc and reduce bimolecular recombination. Through careful engineering of the interfaces, including surface modification of ZnO with PEIE to minimize the energy barrier, and control of P3HT diffusion into PIDSe-DFBT through co-solvents (CH2Cl2/CB), a high PCE of 2.5% is obtained, which is higher than that of the BHJ device. These results show that the sequential processing of bilayer structures provides the feasibility to control the morphology for fabricating more efficient all-polymer solar cells.
