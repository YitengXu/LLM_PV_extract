    , Accepted 27th November 2017First published on 28th November 2017AbstractA novel sunlight-water-energy nexus technology is presented that combines the photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) desalination of saline water and desalination-driven wastewater remediation coupled with the production of molecular hydrogen (H2) from water. To accomplish this, morphologically tailored TiO2 nanorod (TNR) and hydrogen-treated TNR (H-TNR) array photoanodes are placed in an anode cell and Pt foils are located in a cathode cell, while a middle cell containing saline water (0.17 M NaCl) faces these cells through anion and cation exchange membranes, respectively. Upon irradiation by simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), the photogeneration of charge carriers initiates the transport of chloride and sodium in the middle cell to the anode and cathode cells, respectively, leading to the desalination of saline water. The chloride in the anode cell is converted to reactive chlorine species (RCS), which effectively decompose urea to N2 as a primary product (>80%), while the sodium in the cathode cell accelerates the H2 production from water with a Faradaic efficiency of ∼80%. The PEC performance of the H-TNR photoanodes is superior to that of the TNR in the anodic and cathodic processes because of the reduced charge transfer resistance and sub-nanosecond charge transfer kinetics (∼0.19 ns), leading to a specific energy consumption of 4.4 kW h m−3 for 50% desalination, with an energy recovery of ∼0.8 kW h m−3. The hybrid system is found to operate for a period of ∼60 h with natural seawater, and virtually all the photoanodes are shown to be capable of driving the hybrid process. Although tested as a proof-of-concept, the present technology opens up a novel field involving a sunlight-water-energy nexus, promising high efficiency desalination and the desalination-driven remediation of water with simultaneous H2 production.

Broader context
Water and energy are the most essential elements for a sustainable human society. They are strongly interdependent because energy production requires a significant amount of water, while the production, processing, distribution, and end-use of water requires large energy inputs. Several water-energy nexus technologies have emerged, including PV-electrolysis and microbial desalination. Herein, we propose, for the first time, a hybrid process that is driven by sunlight and boosted by electrodialysis. A sunlit inorganic photoanode initiates the desalination of saline water in the middle cell. As the chloride in the middle cell moves to the anode cell, the wastewater (WW) treatment is boosted by reactive chlorine species (RCS) generated via the reaction with photogenerated holes. An increase in the electrical conductivity in the anode cell further enhances the photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) WW treatment. Upon a potential bias, molecular hydrogen (H2) is produced in the cathode cell, and the H2 production is enhanced as the desalination proceeds because of sodium enrichment (i.e., conductivity increase). The produced H2 can alleviate the electrical energy input via fuel cells. The uniqueness and advantages of this hybrid process include its broad range of operating conditions (virtually the entire pH range) and the wide variety of inorganic and organic substrates that can be treated (i.e., aquatic pollutants), while desalination boosts the overall operation and chloride catalyzes the anodic reaction, which in turn facilitates the desalination. Although tested as a proof-of-concept, the present technology opens up a novel field involving a sunlight-water-energy nexus, promising high efficiency desalination and the desalination-boosted remediation of water with simultaneous H2 production.

1. Introduction
Water and energy are the most essential elements for a sustainable human society. They are strongly interdependent because energy production requires a significant amount of water, while the production, processing, distribution, and end-use of water requires large energy inputs.1–3 For example, ∼3% of the electrical energy production in the U.S. is used for wastewater (WW) treatment, while approximately 40% of freshwater withdrawals are used for cooling thermoelectric power plants (∼37 and ∼53 m3 s−1 for 1 GW h coal-fired and nuclear power plants, respectively).3–5 The state-of-the art seawater reverse osmosis desalination process requires 3–4 kW m−3, while emitting 1.4–1.8 kg m−3 of CO2.2 On the other hand, WW contains a large amount of energy in diverse forms, including kinetic, potential, thermal, and internal chemical energy.6,7 Particularly, the last accounts for 6.3–7.6 kJ L−1, which is three times the electrical energy required for its treatment.7
Several water-energy nexus technologies have emerged,8–15 among which microbial desalination is the most representative.16 In principle, this involves the treatment of WW via microbial activity in an anode cell, while desalinating saline water (in the middle cell) and producing electricity. The process is similar to electrodialysis in terms of the system configuration (i.e., a three-cell stack) and desalination mechanism, whereas the microbial desalination is exo-electrogenic and the electrodialysis requires the input of electrical energy. Unfortunately, the microbial desalination process is rather limited in application because of the environmentally sensitive microbial activity. For example, WW must be neutral in pH (5–7) during the entire process to maintain the microbial activity. However, even under highly buffered conditions (e.g., the use of a 100 mM phosphate buffer), a pH decrease below 5 is inevitable as a result of the production of organic acids.16 In addition, the WW substrate is limited, and expensive acetate is often used to boost the microbial activity. Much worse, the enriched chloride in the anode cell adversely affects the bacterial community, as well as the microbial activity.
Herein, we propose, for the first time, a hybrid process that is driven by sunlight and electrodialysis (Scheme 1). A sunlit inorganic photoanode initiates the desalination of saline water in the middle cell. As the chloride in the middle cell moves to the anode cell, the WW treatment is initiated by reactive chlorine species (RCS) generated via the reaction with photogenerated holes. An increase in the electrical conductivity in the anode cell further enhances the photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) WW treatment. Upon a potential bias, molecular hydrogen (H2) is produced in the cathode cell, and the H2 production is enhanced as the desalination proceeds because of sodium enrichment (i.e., conductivity increase). The produced H2 can alleviate the electrical energy input via fuel cells. The uniqueness and advantages of this hybrid process include its broad range of operating conditions (virtually the entire pH range) and the wide variety of inorganic and organic substrates that can be treated (i.e., aquatic pollutants), while desalination drives the overall operation and chloride catalyzes the anodic reaction, which in turn facilitates the desalination. It should be noted that the key in this loop is to efficiently harness sunlight and effectively produce RCS in the WW treatment.17

With this in mind, high efficiency TiO2 nanorod arrays were synthesized via a hydrothermal process followed by a thermal hydrogen treatment to increase the oxygen vacancies. While one-dimensional rod configurations induce a radial directional transfer of minority charge carriers,18–20 the oxygen vacancies created via the hydrogen treatment enhance the overall charge transfer as a result of the improved conductivity.21 Urea was employed as a model WW substrate.17 It is enormously discharged at a gravimetric rate of 240 Mt per day (for comparison, fossil fuel production being 0.5 Mt per day) causing algal bloom, whereas it has a high gravimetric hydrogen content (∼6.71 wt%).22 For practical utilization, natural seawater was tested as a saline water for a period of 60 h. In addition, WO3 was tested as a photoanode for the RSC-mediated decomposition of urea.
2. Experimental
2.1. Fabrication of photoanodes
TiO2 nanorod (TNR) arrays were fabricated on fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO, Pilkington, ∼500 nm thick FTO layer) glass substrates via a hydrothermal reaction. The FTO substrates were cleaned with ultra-sonication for 15 min in aqueous methanol (50 vol%). After drying in an N2 stream, they were placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave containing hydrochloric acid (20 mL, Junsei, 35%), titanium butoxide (0.6 mL, Aldrich, 97%), and deionized water (20 mL, >18 MΩ cm). The autoclave was subjected to heat treatment at 150 °C for 4 h, after which it was cooled to room temperature. The as-synthesized samples were rinsed with a copious amount of deionized water and dried at 60 °C overnight, followed by annealing at 450 °C for 30 min. To synthesize the hydrogen-treated TNR (H-TNR) arrays, the as-obtained TNR samples were placed in a tube furnace at 350 °C for 2 h, through which H2 gas (H2:Ar = 5:95) flowed at 1 bar. WO3 electrodes were synthesized on the FTO via a spin-coating process. Tungsten powder (1 g, Aldrich) was dissolved in aqueous H2O2 (4 mL, 30 wt% in H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) to obtain peroxytungstic acid, to which 2-propanol (Sigma-Aldrich) and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400, Sigma-Aldrich) were sequentially added. Then, the precursor solution was spread on the FTO substrates, followed by annealing at 550 °C for 10 min. After repeating for 14 cycles, the samples were annealed at 550 °C for 1 h.
2.2. Photoelectrocatalytic activity tests
The as-synthesized TNR and H-TNR electrodes (working electrodes), the saturated calomel electrode (SCE, reference electrode), and a Pt foil (counter electrode) were immersed in aqueous sodium sulfate (20 mM, Duksan, 99%) or sodium chloride (20 mM, Daejung, 99%) at pH ∼6 in a single (undivided) cell. Linear sweep voltammograms were obtained from −1 to +1.5 V vs. SCE at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 using a potentiostat (Ivium) in the dark and under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) (ABET Tech). The PEC activities of the as-synthesized TNR and H-TNR samples were examined for the decompositions of N,N-dimethyl-4-nitrosoaniline (RNO, Aldrich),23 phenol (Aldrich),24 and formate (HCOONa, Aldrich),25 as well as the oxygen evolution from water oxidation,26 while applying +0.5 V vs. SCE to the titania samples in the dark or under simulated sunlight. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the TNR and H-TNR electrodes were estimated using the following equation (eqn (1)). IPCE (%) = 1239.8 (V nm) × Iph × 100%/Plight × λ(1)where Iph, Plight, and λ refer to the photocurrent density (mA cm−2) at +0.5 V vs. SCE, photon flux (mW cm−2), and wavelength (nm), respectively.
To examine the sunlight-driven anodic and simultaneous cathodic reactions, an air-tight, two-compartment cell with a proton-exchange membrane (Nafion 117, Chemours) was designed. The TNR and H-TNR electrodes were immersed in the anode cell containing an aqueous solution of urea (CH4N2O, 2 mM, Junsei), and the SCE and Pt foil were placed in the cathode cell to avoid any possible interference from chloride leaching out of the reference electrode with the anodic reaction. The anolyte and catholyte were the same (20 mM Na2SO4 or 20 mM NaCl). A constant potential (+0.5 V vs. SCE) was applied to the TNR and H-TNR electrodes in the dark or under simulated sunlight, while measuring the decomposition of urea, production of intermediates (nitrate and ammonia) in the anode cell, and molecular hydrogen (H2) evolved from water in the cathode cell. N2 was purged through the catholyte for 1 h prior to the PEC reaction.
Finally, an air-tight, three-compartment-stack was designed to combine the electrochemical redox reactions and desalination process. The stack was comprised of an anode cell with photoanodes (i.e., TNR, H-TNR, or WO3) and an aqueous urea solution (2 mM or 10 mM, 15 mL); a middle cell with aqueous NaCl (0.17 M, 10 mL) or natural seawater (10 mL) derived from the East Sea, Korea (latitude: 36.13°, longitude: 129.40°);27 and a cathode cell with a Pt foil and aqueous solution of K2SO4 (2 mM, 15 mL). An anion exchange membrane (AEM, AMI-7001S, Membrane International) and a cation exchange membrane (CEM, CMI-7000S, Membrane International) were placed between the anode and middle cells and between the middle and cathode cells, respectively (Scheme 1). The photocurrent (Iph), cathode potential (Ec), and overall stack voltage (Estack) were recorded while applying a potential bias of +0.5 V vs. SCE to the photoanodes under simulated sunlight. Simultaneously, the chloride and sodium in the three cells were quantified. In addition, the concentrations of urea, NO3−, and NH4+ in the anode cell, and the H2 produced in the cathode cell were estimated.
The urea concentration was determined by the difference between the NH4+ produced from the reaction with urease (Worthington, 55.1 unit mg−1, for dry weight; where 1 unit refers to the decomposition rate of urea to NH4+ at 1 μmol min−1) and the NH4+ present before the reaction with the urease using the following equation:17 (NH2)2CO + H2O + 2H+ + urease → CO2 + 2NH4+(2)The anions (Cl−, NO2−, and NO3−) and cations (Na+ and NH4+) were analyzed using ion chromatographs (IC, Thermo Scientific, DIONEX ICS-1100) equipped with a conductivity detector, IonPac AS-11HC (4 × 250 mm) column for anions, and IonPac CS-12A (4 × 250 mm) column for cations. The total and free chlorine concentrations were estimated using the N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) reagent (Hach method 10101 and 10102).28 The H2 in the cathode cell headspace was quantified using a gas chromatograph (GC, Younglin, ACME 6100GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and Porapac Q column.26 The Faradaic efficiency of the H2 production was estimated using the following equation (eqn (3)). Faradaic efficiency = H2 (mol) × 2F × (100%)/(I × t)(3)where I, t, and F are the current (A), time (s), and Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1), respectively. The ion transport efficiency was estimated using the following equation (eqn (4)). Ion transport efficiency = amount of monovalent ion (mol) for t/(I × t)(4)The specific energy consumption (SEC) for 50% desalination was estimated using the following equation (eqn (5)).29 SEC (kW h m−3) = Estack (V) × Iph (A) × time (h)/saline water volume (m3)(5)
2.3. Surface characterization
The top and cross-sectional morphologies of the as-synthesized TNR and H-TNR samples were examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi SU8200). X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical EMPUREAN) with Cu-Kα radiation (40 kV and 50 mA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher scientific) with Al-Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) were employed to examine the crystallite structures of the samples and binding states of the component elements, respectively. A UV-vis spectrometer (Shimadzu, UV-2450) was used to obtain the absorbance of the samples. The time-resolved photoluminescence lifetime decays were measured using an inverted-type scanning confocal microscope (Microtime-200, Picoquant, Germany) with a 40× objective. The measurements were performed by employing a single-mode pulsed diode laser (379 nm with a pulse width ∼200 ps and ∼30 μW of laser power) as the excitation source. A dichroic mirror (Z375RDC, AHF), a long-wave pass filter (HQ405lp, AHF), and an avalanche photodiode detector (PDM series m MPD) were used to collect emissions from the samples. The measurements were performed at the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Daegu Center, South Korea. A time-correlated single-photon counting technique was used to obtain fluorescence decay curves with a time resolution of 8 ps. The exponential modeling of the obtained fluorescence decays was performed by iterative least squares deconvolution fitting using the SymPhoTime software (version 5.3). The details of the measurements and data analyses are found elsewhere.18,20
3. Results and discussion
3.1. PEC behavior of hydrogen-treated titania NR arrays
The TiO2 samples synthesized via the hydrothermal process for 4 h followed by hydrogen treatment at 350 °C for 2 h (denoted as H-TNR) exhibited a configuration of ∼1 μm tall and ∼120 nm wide nanorod arrays vertically aligned on the FTO substrate (Fig. 1a and b). The overall morphology of H-TNR was nearly the same as that of non-hydrogen-treated TiO2 nanorods (TNR) (Fig. S1, ESI†), indicating that the post-hydrogen treatment is mild and causes insignificant damage to the nanorod frameworks. The XRD spectra of the TNR and H-TNR samples showed identical rutile structures with predominant 101 planes at 2θ = 36.08° (ICDD #01-077-0441) (Fig. 1c). A longer hydrothermal treatment intensified the XRD peaks (Fig. S2, ESI†). The hydrogen treatment changed the color of TNR from white to yellowish gray, and the absorption onset slightly shifted from 407 nm to 415 nm (Fig. 1d). This optical change was trivial, although previous studies reported a significant color change to dark blue and/or black upon a harsh reductive treatment.30–32 Accordingly, the XPS Ti2p band shift was not found in the H-TNR although the surface oxygen was more hydrogenated (Fig. S3, ESI†), suggesting that the Ti(IV) was only partially reduced to Ti(III) via the hydrogen treatment.26,33

The inset shows 2D lifetime images (left: TNR, right: H-TNR). See Fig. S5 (ESI†) for more information. 
Despite these insignificant changes, the H-TNR exhibited a photoelectrochemical performance that was superior to that of the TNR under AM 1.5G light (100 mW cm−2). As shown in Fig. 1e, the linear sweep voltammograms of the TNR and H-TNR showed similar values for the photocurrent onset potential (Eon = ca. −0.1 V vs. SCE) in sodium sulfate electrolyte, whereas the photocurrent density (Iph) of the H-TNR was significantly larger than that of the TNR by a factor of ∼2 (Fig. S4, ESI†). The IPCE profiles further revealed that the H-TNR was far more effective at converting high-energy photons (i.e., λ < 390 nm) (Fig. 1e inset). The fact that there was no significant difference between the IPCE onset wavelengths (∼420 nm) of the TNR and H-TNR samples confirms that the visible light made no contribution to the photocurrent.
The time-resolved photoluminescence emission decay spectra for the TNR and H-TNR were compared, particularly for emission λ values greater than 500 nm (excitation λ = 379 nm) (Fig. 1f). Obviously, the H-TNR sample exhibited a faster decay, and the emission was homogeneous over the sample (Fig. 1f inset). The decay curves were fitted with two exponential components, and the intensity-weighted average lifetimes (τ) were estimated using a curve fitting method reported elsewhere.20 The τ value of the H-TNR was estimated to be ∼0.19 ns, which was ∼2.7 times-shorter than that of the TNR (τ value of ∼0.51 ns). In contrast, the blue emission (i.e., near-bandgap emission) decay kinetics of the two samples were similar, with values of ∼0.22 ns (Fig. S5, ESI†). This indicates that the H-TNR possesses faster charge transfer pathways, particularly via the surface traps (e.g., oxygen vacancies) created by the hydrogen treatment. The Mott–Schottky plots further revealed that the hydrogen treatment increased the donor density (ND) of the TNR by a factor of two (Fig. S6a, ESI†). This can be attributed to the partial reduction of Ti(IV) accompanying an increase in the oxygen vacancies,26,34 which are usually found with TiO2 doped with penta-valence metals (e.g., Nb5+).35 Therefore, the partially reduced states of TiO2 (i.e., the existence of Ti(4−x)+ and/or oxygen vacancies) should increase the electrical conductivity, while producing altered charge transfer pathways.36 The impedance (Nyquist plots) confirms that the charge transfer resistances at the NR/solution interface and inside the NR are significantly reduced by hydrogen treatment (Fig. S6b, ESI†).
With this knowledge in mind, the PEC performances of the TNR and H-TNR electrodes was compared for various chemical redox reactions in single compartment (undivided) cells. The detailed experimental results were discussed in the ESI.† As summarized in Table 1, the H-TNR electrodes exhibited superior PEC activity for O2 production via multi-electron transfer water oxidation (eqn (R1) in ESI†). This enhanced PEC performance of the H-TNR should be attributed to larger photocurrents (Iph). However, the enhancement factor (i.e., the PEC activity of the H-TNR with respect to TNR ∼1.2) was smaller than the Iph ratio of H-TNR/TNR (∼1.9). The reduced Faradaic efficiency of the H-TNR (∼63% for H-TNR and ∼80% for TNR, Fig. S7a, ESI†) confirmed the low PEC activity for O2 production, suggesting the existence of other electron transfer oxidation pathways. As the first candidate among them, the hydroxyl radical (OH˙) mediated oxidation was examined using well-known OH˙ quenchers (RNO and phenol, see eqn (R2), ESI†). However, the enhancement factor (1.2–1.3) was comparable to that for O2 production (Fig. S7b and S8, ESI†). Alternatively, we investigated direct electron (i.e., valence band hole) transfer oxidation using formate as a probe substrate to examine the pathway eqn (R3) (ESI†).25 The enhancement factor for the formate decomposition was enhanced to ∼1.56 (Fig. S7b, ESI†), which was closer to the Iph ratio. This indicates that the H-TNR is particularly active for direct electron transfer oxidation processes.

3.2. RCS-mediated oxidation of urea and simultaneous H2 production
The oxidation of chloride (an inorganic hole scavenger) was further tested because it proceeds predominantly with the direct electron transfer.23,24,37 With 20 mM chloride, the total amount of reactive chlorine species (RCS, including Cl2˙− and HOCl/OCl−) produced using the H-TNR (see eqn (R4)–(R6), ESI†) was ∼1.8 fold-larger than that using the TNR (Table 1). No Cl2 gas bubble was observed because of relatively low concentrations of chloride and RSC.38 The amounts of RCS reached a plateau (Fig. S9, ESI†), which can be attributed to the back reactions that usually occur in the undivided cell.39–41 To avoid the back reactions, the as-synthesized TNR and H-TNR arrays were coupled to Pt foils, and these were separated via a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) (Fig. 2a). The PEC performances of these pairs in the degradation of urea in two different electrolytes (sulfate vs. chloride) were compared because urea and chloride are two major components in human urine-contaminated water.17,28 With a TNR photoanode at +0.5 V vs. SCE, a stable Iph of 1–1.2 mA cm−2 was generated over 12 h in both electrolytes (Fig. 2a). Despite a more positive Eon in the sulfate (see Fig. 1e), the Iph value in the sulfate was slightly larger than that in chloride as a result of a higher conductivity (1.79 and 2.88 mS cm−1 for 20 mM NaCl and Na2SO4, respectively),42 which is in agreement with the literature.17,23,24,37,43 However, the decomposition of urea in the sulfate (predominantly via. hydroxyl radicals) was limited (kapp ∼ 0.04 h−1), whereas it was significantly enhanced by a factor of ∼6 in the chloride as a result of the RCS-mediated decomposition of urea (eqn (R7), ESI†, Fig. 2b, and Table 1). It is of note that the bimolecular reaction rate constant of urea with hydroxyl radical is only 7.9 × 105 L mol−1 s−1, which is four orders of magnitude smaller compared to other organic compounds (e.g., 6.6 × 109 L mol−1 s−1 for phenol).44 Nitrate (NO3−) was found to be a primary degradation product of urea for the TNR in both the electrolytes, with similar production rates (∼54 μM h−1) (Fig. 2c). On the other hand, there was only a trace concentration of ammonia (NH4+), which reached a plateau in 4 h (Fig. 2d). The larger production of ammonia in the chloride electrolyte suggests the existence of chloroamines as intermediates in the decomposition pathway (see Fig. S13, ESI†).28

For legend, see (c) and (d). 
The H-TNR was further compared with the TNR in the sulfate and chloride electrolytes, with the following primary feature. First, a larger and more stable Iph was generated over 12 h. Second, the kapp values for the urea decomposition (4.72 × 10−1 h−1) were ∼2 and ∼11 times higher than those with the TNR in the chloride and sulfate electrolytes, respectively (Table 1). The amount of nitrate doubled, while the ammonia concentration increased significantly. Third, the H2 production rate (13 μmol h−1) was the highest because of the enhanced Iph (Fig. 2e). These results clearly suggest that the H-TNR is superior to the TNR not only in generating a photocurrent but also in oxidizing chloride to RCS, enhancing the urea decomposition kinetics and H2 production. Finally, when the urea concentration was increased 5-fold (i.e., 10 mM), the H-TNR exhibited a similar PEC performance in terms of the Iph, urea decomposition kinetics (kapp ∼ 3.33 × 10−1 h−1), and H2 production (Fig. S10, ESI†). This similarity was attributed to the unique feature of the RCS-mediated reaction, which does not need any direct interaction of urea and H-TNR.
3.3. PEC desalination, desalination-driven PEC decomposition of urea, and simultaneous H2 production
To utilize the RCS-mediated oxidation using the H-TNR, we designed a three-cell stack (Scheme 1). Upon the irradiation of the H-TNR held at +0.5 V vs. SCE, there was a trace Iph in the initial phase and it linearly increased for ∼6 h, finally reaching a plateau of 2–2.5 mA (Fig. 3a). The TNR sample exhibited a similar profile, but with a smaller Iph. The operational stack voltage (Estack) between the H-TNR photoanode and Pt cathode couple gradually increased and reached a plateau of ∼2.5 V after 2 h. These Iph and Estack behaviors were significantly different from those observed in the two-cell configuration (Fig. 2a). The difference could be attributed to low initial anolyte and catholyte concentrations in the three-cell stack (each 2 mM).
 Fig. 3  Photoelectrocatalytic urea (C0 = 2 mM, 15 mL) decomposition using TNR and H-TNR in anode cell, desalination in middle cell (NaCl 170 mM, 10 mL) equipped with anion and cation exchange membranes (dashed lines), and simultaneous H2 production in cathode cell containing K2SO4 (C0 = 2 mM, 15 mL). Iph refers to photocurrent density produced from TNR and H-TNR held at +0.5 V vs. SCE under AM 1.5 light (100 mW cm−2), and Estack indicates the overall three-cell stack voltage across the anode, middle, and cathode cells. (a) Changes in Iph and Estack. (b) Changes in the amounts of ions in the anode, middle, and cathode cells. (c) Time-profiled changes in urea concentration and TOC (upper panel), and concomitant production of ammonia and nitrate (lower panel). (d) H2 production in the cathode cell and Faradaic efficiency for the produced H2. 
With such low electrolyte concentrations, the transfers of the photogenerated holes and electrons at the H-TNR/anolyte and Pt/catholyte interfaces, respectively, should be limited. The build-up of the charge carriers in the H-TNR and Pt can induce the transport of chloride and sodium from the middle cell to the anode and cathode cells, respectively (Fig. 3b). Increases in the ion concentrations of both electrolytes increase the electrical conductivity, facilitating the separation and transfer of the photogenerated charge carriers (i.e., increasing Iph) and, as a result, accelerating the ion transport from the middle cell (vice versa). However, once the ion concentrations in the anolyte and catholyte reach a certain level (e.g., 0.3 mmol, corresponding to ∼20 mM for the chloride in the anolyte at 6 h), the electrical conductivity of the electrolyte is high enough that the overall process becomes limited by the PEC performance of the H-TNR and hence Iph reaches a plateau (2–2.5 mA). As shown in Fig. 3b, the amount of chloride in the anolyte increased rather slowly in the initial phase (∼4 h) and linearly later on, confirming the non-linear ion transport kinetics. The amount of sodium in the catholyte followed the same trend, indicating the equimolar ion transport. In addition, the amounts of ions in the middle cell slowly decreased in the initial phase and linearly afterward, which showed a tendency similar to those in the electrolytes. Furthermore, the Δions value (difference in the number of ions over a certain period of time) in the middle cell was similar to the Δions values in the electrolytes. The ion transport efficiency (Δions/flowed charges) was estimated to be ∼100% for the chloride and sodium (Fig. S11, ESI†).
Once transported to the anolyte, chloride is quickly oxidized to RCS by the photogenerated holes, accompanying a decrease in pH (Fig. S12 and eqn (R6), ESI†) while initiating the oxidation of urea (eqn (R4)–(R7), ESI†). The simultaneous PEC water oxidation (Fig. S7a and eqn (R1), ESI†) should accelerate the pH decrease. As shown in Fig. 3c, a trace amount of urea (∼0.1 mM) was decomposed in the initial phase (∼2 h) due to the small amount of chloride in the anolyte (<0.04 mmol, i.e., ∼3 mM as shown Fig. 3b), whereas most of the produced RCSs (0.3 mM) were used for the urea decomposition (Fig. S13, ESI†). Urea can be directly oxidized by the photogenerated holes; however, such a direct oxidation pathway was found to be limited (Δurea ∼ 10% for 2 h in 20 mM sulfate solution as shown in Fig. 2b). With an increase in the amount of chloride in the anolyte, the urea decomposition with chlorination was accelerated, reached a peak at 4 h, and was completed in 8 h (compare Fig. 3c and Fig. S13, ESI† for the H-TNR). Nitrate and ammonia were produced as the decomposition products of urea in the liquid phase (Fig. 3c), whereas the nitrogen deficiency gradually increased and reached more than 80% in 8 h because of the N2 production (Fig. S13b, ESI†). It is noteworthy that the time-profiled productions of nitrate and ammonia were slightly different from those in the two-cell configuration (Fig. 2c and d), presumably because of the time-transient chloride concentration and pH in the three-cell stack (Fig. S12, ESI†). However, it is evident that there was usually a peak in the production of ammonia, whereas the nitrate production continued over time, indicating that chloroamine intermediates (NHxCl3−x, where x = 0, 1, 2, 3) were decomposed to nitrate and N2 at a later stage. The gradual decomposition of chloroamines led to increases in the free chlorine concentration (Fig. S13a, ESI†). The H2 production via the proton reduction (2H+ + 2e− → H2O) in the cathode cell followed a trend similar to the urea decomposition of the anode cell. It was insignificant in the initial phase for 2 h and increased linearly over time (Fig. 3d). This behavior could be understood in terms of the cathode potential (Ec), which was transient during the first 2 h and then stabilized (Fig. S14, ESI†). Nevertheless, the slowed H2 production in the later stage was attributed to the accumulation in the headspace and highly alkaline condition (Fig. S12, ESI†). The catalytic activity of Pt cathode remained unchanged for 12 h (Fig. S15, ESI†), which excludes the possibility of the Pt activity loss. The Faradaic efficiency of the H2 production was estimated to be ∼80% (Fig. 3d). It is of note that the overall pH difference between anolyte and catholyte was ∼10, which was significantly greater than that found in the two-compartment cell with PEM (Fig. S12, ESI†). This indicates that the protons produced in the anolyte via the chloride oxidation (e.g., eqn (R6), ESI†) could not be transported to the catholyte across AEM and CEM in the three-cell stack. As a result, a voltage loss of approximately 0.59 V (= 0.5916 V/ΔpH × ΔpH 10) arose, leading to the time-dependent photocurrent and H2 production, and decreasing the overall energy efficiency of the three-cell stack.
With a 5-fold larger urea concentration (10 mM), similar time-dependent changes in Iph and Estack for the TNR and H-TNR were obtained (Fig. S16, ESI†). The primary difference compared to the case with the low urea concentration (2 mM, Fig. 3) was the gradual decrease in Iph after the peak (∼12 h), which finally reached its minimum level after ∼36 h (particularly for the H-TNR). Similar to this profile, the amount of ions in the middle cell decreased linearly over time and reached a minimum level in ∼36 h. The time-profiled changes in the amount of ions in the anolyte and catholyte were the same as the ion transports in the middle cell. This behavior indicates that virtually all the ions in the middle cell can be transported to the neighboring cells. Meanwhile, the decomposition of urea was completed in 12 h. Ammonia was concomitantly produced over 12 h and further decomposed to nitrate, confirming that it was the intermediate. Even after the complete vanishing of urea and peak in the production of ammonia, the continuous production of nitrate indicates that nitrate is one of the final products. Instead of a potentiostat, a DC power supply (2 V) was employed and a similar system performance was obtained (Fig. 3vs. Fig. S17, ESI†). Based on the DC-powered results, the specific energy consumption (SEC) of the present three-cell stack for 50% desalination was estimated to be ∼4.4 kW h m−3 (Table 1). This SEC value is comparable to that of electrodialysis (1–15 kW h m−3) and much greater than that of the state-of-the art reverse osmosis (∼2.8 kW h m−3),29 indicating that the present system operates efficiently, even during a proof-of-concept test. The total desalination rate can be significantly increased using multiple desalination-chamber stacks, as demonstrated in the two desalination-chamber stack, which has a desalination rate that is 1.4-times faster than that of the single desalination chamber.45 The obtained SEC value can be further reduced by feeding the evolved H2 back into the stack as electrical energy via a fuel cell. In addition, the energy input required for the remediation of urea using conventional treatment processes could be saved. If these saved energies are combined with the SEC value, the overall operational energy input for the desalination would be ∼3.6 kW h m−3.
We applied this system to seawater desalination while utilizing desalted chloride for the remediation of urea (10 mM) using the H-TNR (Fig. 4a). The cathode cell was open to atmosphere to avoid an H2 pressure buildup. While Estack (∼2.2 V) was nearly constant over 60 h, Iph stabilized at ∼1.5 mA after a peak at ∼3.5 mA. Urea was completely decomposed in ∼10 h and the nitrate production continued over a period of 60 h. This demonstrates that the as-fabricated PEC system successfully operates with seawater. Instead of TiO2 (TNR and H-TNR), WO3 with a smaller bandgap (2.6–2.8 eV) was employed as a photoanode (Fig. 4b). With brackish water (0.17 M NaCl) in the middle cell, a similar PEC behavior (i.e., a nearly constant Estack of ∼2.3 V and increasing Iph) was observed. Equimolar chloride and sodium ions were transported to the anode and cathode cells, respectively, while urea was decomposed, and nitrate and ammonia were produced. The slower kinetics of the urea decomposition and smaller amount of nitrate were attributed to the lower PEC performance of WO3 compared to the TNR and H-TNR. This indicates that the RCS-mediated decomposition of urea with simultaneous desalination can be performed with nearly all photoanodes, and the overall performance is determined by the photoanode employed.

4. Conclusions
This proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrated the operation of a system for photoelectrochemical desalination, and desalination-driven water treatment coupled with hydrogen production from water. Morphology-tailored, thermochemically treated TiO2 nanorod arrays were found to be active for the oxidation of chloride to reactive chlorine species. To couple the photoinduced process and conventional electrochemical desalination process, a three-cell stack was fabricated. The stack initiated the hybrid process with photogenerated charge carriers, followed by ion transportation from the middle cell to the neighboring cells. As the desalination proceeded, the generation of reactive chlorine species by the photogenerated holes drove the oxidation of urea in the anode cell, while H2 was produced in the cathode cell. The kinetically facile generation of reactive chlorine species against the O2 evolution from water led to the effective remediation of aquatic pollutants, and further widened the applicability of diverse photoanodes, including WO3. The specific energy consumption for desalination of the present system was ∼4.4 kW h m−3, which was shown to be further reduced upon including the H2 energy and the savings in the energy required for the anodic treatment. The further modification of the cathodes can expand the applicability of the present system, particularly for other chemical conversions.

Broader context
Water and energy are the most essential elements for a sustainable human society. They are strongly interdependent because energy production requires a significant amount of water, while the production, processing, distribution, and end-use of water requires large energy inputs. Several water-energy nexus technologies have emerged, including PV-electrolysis and microbial desalination. Herein, we propose, for the first time, a hybrid process that is driven by sunlight and boosted by electrodialysis. A sunlit inorganic photoanode initiates the desalination of saline water in the middle cell. As the chloride in the middle cell moves to the anode cell, the wastewater (WW) treatment is boosted by reactive chlorine species (RCS) generated via the reaction with photogenerated holes. An increase in the electrical conductivity in the anode cell further enhances the photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) WW treatment. Upon a potential bias, molecular hydrogen (H2) is produced in the cathode cell, and the H2 production is enhanced as the desalination proceeds because of sodium enrichment (i.e., conductivity increase). The produced H2 can alleviate the electrical energy input via fuel cells. The uniqueness and advantages of this hybrid process include its broad range of operating conditions (virtually the entire pH range) and the wide variety of inorganic and organic substrates that can be treated (i.e., aquatic pollutants), while desalination boosts the overall operation and chloride catalyzes the anodic reaction, which in turn facilitates the desalination. Although tested as a proof-of-concept, the present technology opens up a novel field involving a sunlight-water-energy nexus, promising high efficiency desalination and the desalination-boosted remediation of water with simultaneous H2 production.
