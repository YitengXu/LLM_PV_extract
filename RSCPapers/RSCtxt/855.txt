    , Accepted 5th October 2015First published on 26th October 2015AbstractFor the first time we report a simple synthetic strategy to prepare copper sulfide counter electrodes on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates using the inexpensive chemical bath deposition method in the presence of hydrochloric acid (HCl) at different deposition times. CuS nanoplatelet structures were uniformly grown on the FTO substrate with a good dispersion and optimized conditions. The growth process of the CuS nanoplatelets can be controlled by changing the deposition time in the presence of HCl. HCl acts as a complexing agent as well as improving S2− concentration against S atoms in this one-step preparation. The photovoltaic performance was significantly improved in terms of the power conversion efficiency (PCE), short-circuit density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and the fill factor (FF). The optimized deposition time of CuS 60 min resulted in a higher PCE of 4.06%, Jsc of 12.92 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.60 V, and a FF of 0.52 compared to CuS 50 min, CuS 70 min, and a Pt CE. The superior performance of the 60 min sample is due to the greater electrocatalytic activity and low charge transfer resistance at the interface of the CE and the polysulfide electrolyte. The concentration of Cu/S also had an important role in the formation of the CuS nanoplatelet structures. The optical bandgaps for the CuS with different morphologies were measured to be in the range of 1.98–2.28 eV. This improved photovoltaic performance is mainly attributed to the greater number of active reaction sites created by the CuS layer on the FTO substrate, which results large specific surface, superior electrical conductivity, low charge transfer resistance, and faster electron transport in the presence of HCl. Cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Tafel-polarization measurements were used to investigate the electrocatalytic activity of the CuS and Pt CEs. This synthetic procedure not only provides high electrocatalytic activity for QDSSCs but could also be a cost-effective way to fabricate flexible electrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells or supercapacitor applications.
1. Introduction
High efficiency solar energy conversion could address the issues of global warming and help to meet the urgent demand for clean energy. In the past few years, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have been the most promising liquid-junction photovoltaic devices and have recently attracted great attention from both academia and industry. The photoelectrochemical mechanism of QDSSCs is similar to the concept for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) consisting of a photoanode based on a QD-loaded mesoporous metal oxide film (mainly TiO2), an electrolyte, and a counter electrode (CE).
QDSSCs have attracted much attention for the development of next-generation solar cells due to their acceptable power conversion efficiency, synthetic procedure, high theoretical thermodynamic efficiency (44%), and low production cost.1,2 The advantages of QDSSCs include a larger extinction coefficient, hot-carrier transfer, multiple exciton generation, and tunable optical absorption of the quantum dots (QDs).3–6 QDSSCs are based on the photosensitization of wide-band-gap semiconductor photoanodes (TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, etc.) with QDs such as CdS,7 CdSe,8 and PbS.7,9 The use of such semiconductor materials is an attractive option for absorbing visible light and maximizing charge separation and transfer at the various interfaces. These improvements are important for improving the energy conversion efficiency in solution-processed photovoltaics.10
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of QDSSCs has seen significant improvements with the advances in QDSSC research in the past decade.11–16 To date, PCEs of up to ∼8%17 have been achieved. However, QDSSCs still show limited efficiency because of the poor electrical catalytic activity between the electrolyte and the CE compared to competing systems, such as DSSCs18 and thin-film-based solar cells,19 including perovskite solar cells.20,21 To improve the performance of QDSSCs, the optimization and design of the CE and the electrolyte play crucial roles. The charge recombination at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface and the poor charge transfer rate between the CE and the redox couple need to be minimized.
The CE is responsible for the catalysis and reduction of the oxidized species and for transmitting the electrons from the external circuit to the electrolyte.22 The choice of CE greatly depends on the catalytically active material used for the electrolyte redox couple in solution-processed solar cells. The Pt electrode widely used in DSSCs has high conductivity, stability, and electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of iodide/triiodide.23,24 But in the case of QDSSCs, it is not compatible with the sulfide/polysulfide-based electrolyte because of the strong chemisorption of the sulfur species on the platinum surface. This results in a poisoning effect, poor conductivity, electrocatalytic activity, fill factor, and photovoltaic performance.25,26 To replace the expensive Pt, researchers have made great efforts to develop new materials. To date, the optimal electrolyte for QDSSCs has been the polysulfide electrolyte (S2−/Sn2−), which can greatly stabilize metal chalcogenides and provide good performance.25
To increase the efficiency of QDSSCs and for optimization of the CE-electrolyte interface and fill factor, various metal chalcogenide materials have been investigated as alternatives to Pt CEs. Examples include Cu2S,15,27 PbS,28 NiS,29 Cu2ZnSnS4,30 TiC,31 conducting polymers,32 and carbon-based materials (nanotubes, graphene, carbon black, and mesoporous carbon).33–35 These metal chalcogenide sulfides show high stability, low resistance, and high electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of a polysulfide electrolyte.27,36 Among these materials Cu2S has been commonly used in recent years because of its high electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of the polysulfide electrolyte in QDSSCs.37 Copper sulfide with five different stoichiometries exists in a wide variety of compositions, ranging from covellite (CuS), anilite (Cu1.75S), djurleite (Cu1.95S), chalcocite (Cu2S), and digenite (Cu1.8S), that are known to be stable at room temperature.38 Furthermore, copper sulfide has potential applications for catalysis,39 tissue imaging,40 drug delivery,41 Li-ion batteries,42 biosensors,43 and memory cells.44 Depending on their stoichiometries copper sulfides have different morphologies, such as nanoplates,45 nanorods46 nanowires,47,48 nanoparticles,49 ball-flower,50 hollow cages,51 and hollow spheres.52 In addition, it offers further advantages such as energy saving, simplicity and low cost. Therefore, it has the potential of being used in large scale commercial productions.53
The common strategy to fabricate CuS CEs is by exposing the Cu metal to a polysulfide-electrolyte solution to form a CuS interfacial layer on the substrate.27,28,36 After an acid treatment, the black CuS film is easy to peel off from the Cu substrate, resulting in poisoning of the photoanode and detachment from the substrates.54 Such CEs suffer from continual corrosion in the polysulfide electrolyte, ultimately leading to mechanical instability and leakage of the electrolyte solution.55 This is a serious drawback that can make Cu2S CEs unstable.36
To overcome this problem several deposition methods have been applied to deposit metal sulfides on FTO or ITO glass such as successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR),56 electro deposition,57 proximal (or direct) adsorption58 or epitaxial growth,59 chemical bath deposition (CBD)60 and chemical linking of colloidal QDs.61 However, these methods have some drawbacks regarding the uniformity of the CEs and the charge transfer.54 To determine the efficiency of QDSSCs, the degree of adhesion of the active materials on the FTO substrate as the CE is very important.62 If the material does not stick to the FTO substrate it could be released into the electrolyte and the stability of the CE may decrease. Compared to those methods, the CBD method has gained popularity due to its simplicity and more importantly the intimate contact between donors and acceptors, in which QDs are formed directly on the substrate by the ionic species from the precursor solutions. However, despite these advances new CE materials are required to further enhance the PCE of QDSSCs with high stability, high electrocatalytic activity, and consistent performance in sulfide/polysulfide electrolyte.
In the present study we explored a simple cost-effective CBD method to fabricate CuS nanoplatelet structure thin films on a FTO substrate using hydrochloric acid (HCl) with different deposition times. The method does not require any post-treatments such as annealing or coating with other materials. The main advantages of this method are the shorter duration deposition times, lower temperature, and simpler reagent than that of previous reports.55,63,64 The obtained product has good crystallinity, uniform morphology, and high purity. An energy conversion efficiency of 4.06% was achieved using simple inexpensive materials and a cost-effective process. This is the best efficiency achieved using CuS CEs incorporated with HCl for QDSSCs thus far.55,63,64 A CuS film was synthesized through CBD by an in situ reaction based on a nanoplatelet structure, which allowed for effective control of the surface morphology and improved the electrocatalytic activity for the polysulfide electrolyte. The present one-step strategy proves to be a convenient, efficient and environmentally friendly way to produce copper sulfide nanoplatelets.
The transport pathways of the electrons and the photoelectrical conversion configuration of a TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS based QDSSCs with a nanoplatelet structure of CuS CE is described in Fig. 1. The configuration consists of the anatase TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS QD sensitizer, polysulfide electrolyte and FTO/CuS CE.

2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
The following chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich: copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O, 98.0%), thioacetamide C2H5NS, 99.0%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%), cadmium acetate (Cd (CH3COO·2H2O), sodium sulfide (Na2S·9H2O), sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), selenium (Se) (100 mesh 99.5%), zinc acetate (CH3CO2)2Zn, 99%), potassium chloride (KCl), and TiO2 paste (Ti-nanoxide HT/SP). All chemicals were used directly without further purification.
2.2. Preparation of CuS and Pt CEs
CBD was used to prepare the copper sulfide CEs with various deposition times, which were deposited on FTO substrates with a sheet resistance of 7 Ω cm−2. Prior to CBD, the FTO glass was sequentially cleaned with acetone, ethanol, and DI water under sonication for 10 min each and dried with N2 gas. Briefly, for the deposition of the CuS thin films, CuSO4·5H2O was used as a copper precursor, C2H5NS was used as a sulfur source, and HCl was used as a reagent in the deposition. Copper sulfate reacts with the concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) very strongly and the HCl plays the role of strong inorganic acid and acts as a reagent in the oxidation–reduction reaction. In 50 ml of deionized water (DI), 0.1 M CuSO4·5H2O was dissolved under magnetic stirring. Then, 0.9 M C2H5NS was added to the blue solution and vigorously stirred for about 30 min to obtain a transparent solution. Afterward, the two transparent solutions were mixed together with slow stirring. 0.8 ml of HCl was added to the above solution drop by drop under vigorous stirring for about 1 h. The digital images of the CuS precursor preparation with HCl and without HCl are shown in Fig. S1(ESI†). From the digital images we clearly observed the color of the solution gradually changes from a pale yellow color to completely white color without HCl and with HCl.
The well-cleaned FTO substrates were dipped horizontally in the growth solution and placed in a hot air oven. The deposition times were 50 min, 60 min, 70 min, and 80 min with a constant temperature of 65 °C. The CuS thin films are denoted by their deposition times as CuS 50 min, CuS 60 min, CuS 70 min, and CuS 80 min. After the deposition, the CuS-coated thin films were moved outside and cooled to room temperature. After cooling, the CuS-coated FTO substrates were taken out and rinsed with DI water, ethanol, and dried with an air stream. When the deposition time was 80 min, the CuS-coated substrates peeled off from the film, so further experiments and preparations of CuS CEs used deposition times of 50 min, 60 min, and 70 min.
The bare CuS CE was prepared without HCl concentration by using the optimized best condition of CuS 60 min at 65 °C and is labeled as bare CuS CE. For comparison, we prepared commercial Pt paste, applied it to well-cleaned FTO substrates using the doctor blade method, and heat treated it at 450 °C in air for 10 minutes.
2.3. Synthesis of working electrode (TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS)
Well-cleaned FTO substrates were used to fabricate the QD-sensitized photoanodes. SILAR was used to assemble the QDs on TiO2 film. Briefly, TiO2 paste composed of Ti-nanoxide HT/SP (Solaronix) was coated by the doctor blade method to form an active area of 0.25 cm2 and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. For CdS QD deposition, the TiO2 film was dipped into an aqueous solution of 0.1 M cadmium acetate dehydrate (Cd(CH3COO)2) for 5 min to allow Cd2+ ions to attach to the TiO2-coated electrode. The film was rinsed with DI water and ethanol for 1 min to remove the excess Cd2+ ions and dried under N2 gas (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  Typical scheme of the CdS/CdSe/ZnS by SILAR on the surface of TiO2. 
Subsequently, the films were dipped for another 5 min into a solution of 0.2 M sodium sulfide (Na2S) for the S2− ions to adsorb on the TiO2 and to form CdS QDs. They were then rinsed with DI water and ethanol and then dried with N2 gas. This two-step dipping procedure defines one cycle. The process was repeated for 5 cycles at room temperature to achieve good adhesion on the substrate. The as-prepared electrodes are represented as TiO2/CdS5 photoanodes.
For CdSe QD deposition, Se was used for SILAR. A refluxing technique was used to prepare the Se with an aqueous solution containing 0.2 M of Se and 0.4 M of Na2SO3 at 120 °C for 4 h. The TiO2/CdS5 electrodes were dipped into a solution of 0.1 M Cd (CH3COO)2 and 0.2 M Se for 5 min at 50 °C, washed with DI water and ethanol for 1 min, and dried with N2 gas. This sequential coating was repeated for 8 cycles. To achieve better performance, the TiO2/CdS5/CdSe8 photoanodes were passivated with ZnS and finally immersed twice into an aqueous solution of 0.1 M Zn (CH3COO)2·2H2O and 0.1 M Na2S for 1 min each, and this process was repeated for 2 cycles while alternately washing with DI water and ethanol and then drying with N2 gas. The use of wide-band-gap semiconductors (typically ZnS) as passivation layers on the QD sensitizers can efficiently suppress the current leakage from the QDs due to the electrolyte and prevent charge recombination in QDSSCs.65 Moreover, the ZnS passivation layer can further increase the efficiency of the QDSSCs.
2.4. Fabrication of symmetric cells for EIS and Tafel analysis
The QD-adsorbed TiO2 electrodes and CEs (CuS and Pt) were assembled using a hot melting sheet (SX 1170-60, Solaronix) at 100 °C, and the internal space was filled with a redox liquid electrolyte containing 1 M Na2S with 2 M S and 0.2 M KCl in methanol and DI water at a ratio of 7:3. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel measurements were carried out using a BioLogic potentiostat/galvanostat/EIS analyzer (SP-150, France) with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 for the symmetrical dummy cells of the CuS and Pt CEs under dark conditions.
2.5. Characterization techniques
The crystal structure and wide-angle X-ray scattering of the synthesized CuS thin films were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). A D8 ADVANCE was used with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.54060) at 40 kV and 40 mA in the range 20°–80°. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out with a Quantum 2000 scanning ESCA Microprobe spectrometer using focused monochromatized Al Kα radiation of (1486 eV) and with an electron take off angle of 90°. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and transmission electron microscopy images were obtained on a JEM2011 model with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The constituents and morphology changes of CuS films and the elemental compositions of the CEs were examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, SU-70, Hitachi) operated at 10.0 kV with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) operated at 15 kV. Cyclic voltammetry (scan rate of 40 mV s−1) was performed in aqueous solution containing sodium sulfide (0.1 M), sulfur (0.1 M), and KCl (0.01 M) as the support electrolyte. The surface roughness of the CuS FTO substrate was characterized by atomic force microscopy with a scan rate of 0.8 Hz in contact mode (JPK Nano Wizard II AFM, JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany).
The diffuse reflection of absorption spectra of the CuS thin films were measured using an Optizen 3220 UV spectrophotometer. The photocurrent density–voltage characteristics of the QDSSCs were measured under one-sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) using an ABET technologies (USA) solar simulator with an irradiance constancy of ±3%. For better understanding the J–V performance and electrocatalytic activity of the CuS CEs, we have conducted cyclic voltammetry analysis with fresh electrolyte using 0.1 M KCl, 0.1 M Na2S, and 0.1 M S, in the presence of HCl and without HCl, respectively. To analyze the electron behaviors in the QDSSCs, electron impedance spectroscopy measurements were recorded using an impedance analyzer in the frequency range of 100 mHz to 500 kHz.
3. Results and discussion
To clarify the crystalline structure of the CuS CEs, the thin films were examined by XRD analysis, as shown in Fig. 3. The diffraction peaks of 2θ values of 38.8°, 44.3°, 78.5°, and 80.9° can be assigned to the corresponding [105], [008], [209], and [214] crystal planes of CuS, which can be indexed as a hexagonal structure. The reported values matched well with JCPDS card no. 01-079-2321.66 Based on the (JCPDS 01-079-2321) card, it can be found that the intensities of the [105], [008] peaks are superior and the peaks of [209], [214] are reduced. After increasing the deposition time from 50 min to 70 min, new peaks corresponding to the diffraction peaks appeared at 38.8°, 43.1° 2θ, designating that the surface of the sample is mainly composed of CuS. Moreover peak [105] is absent for 50 and 70 min due to a phase change during the growth of the samples over 50 min as is clearly evidenced from the SEM images. When the deposition time was increased from 70 min to 80 min, the film was peeled off. The selective growth of CuS nanoplatelet structures on the FTO marks the disappearance of the high-indexed facet peaks. The pure phase and sharp peaks in the XRD pattern implied the compound CuS have good crystallinity through the CBD. Therefore the deposition time and the molar ratio of Cu/S in the precursor solution play an important role in the film formation on the FTO substrate. The previous studies reasonably suggest that the crystal structure of CuS nanoplatelets was mostly based on a hexagonal phase.
 Fig. 3  X-ray diffraction spectrum of CuS thin films deposited on FTO substrates. 
FE-SEM was used to evaluate the surface morphology and purity of CuS CEs on FTO obtained with different deposition times. Fig. 4 shows top-view SEM images of the CuS deposited on the FTO substrate for bare CuS, CuS 50 min, CuS 60 min, and CuS 70 min at a constant temperature of 65 °C. In studying the growth process of CuS from a group of nanoplatelets with tube like structure to a densely packed nanoplatelet structure, different morphologies were obtained for each deposition time. Interestingly, when the deposition time was less than 50 min, there was no coating on the FTO substrate. The color of solution turned more white with increasing the deposition time in the presence of HCl. When the deposition time was over 50 min, the color of solution becomes dark, which means the formation of copper sulfide. The SEM images in Fig. 4(a and a1) show the surface morphology of the bare CuS CE without HCl, indicating a bunch of nanopletelet surface structures are formed. At the deposition time of 50 min, a group of intertwined nanoplatelet structures and a film thickness of 800 nm were observed in the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 5(a)). By extending the deposition time from 50 min to 60 min, more platelets were distributed on the surface and the film structure changes from a group of intertwined nanoplatelet structures to broad nanoplatelets and the gap between the platelets is also reduced. This clearly resembles nanoplatelet structures. The film thickness was also increased from 800 nm to 985 nm, as shown in (Fig. 5(b)). After 50 min, the film had improved morphology, which may increase its electrocatalytic activity to efficiently transfer electrons in QDSSCs.

When the deposition time was increased from 60 to 70 min, a similar morphology with increased densely packed nanoplatelet structures was observed. The film thickness was 1.12 μm (Fig. 5(c)). The sizes of the nanoplatelet structures increased with increased deposition time from 50 min to 70 min. When further extending the deposition time from 70 min to 80 min, the CuS begins to peel off from the FTO substrate and we didn't observe any morphology or efficiency changes when compared to CuS 50 min, CuS 60 min and CuS 70 min. The change of morphology from a group of nanoplatelets with a tube like structure to a densely packed nanoplatelet structure is affected by the Kirkendall effect67,68 and it is unusual in structures with progressive structural changes in morphology. As seen in the cross-section view of the SEM images of Fig. 5(a–c) reveled that all films became thicker gradually as the CBD reaction processed and the film thick as 1.12 μm after 70 min deposition time. This statement indicates that the thickness of CuS films can be controlled by changing deposition times. The cross-sectional view of the SEM images of CuS 60 min shows a vertical structure from the bottom to the top, which offers rapid electron transfer from the FTO interface to the reaction sites. Compared to the 50 min and 70 min samples, the CuS 60 min CE had good adhesion to the FTO substrate. The film grows like a densely packed nanoplatelet structure without any pores. Fig. 5(d) shows the growth mechanism of the CuS nanoplatelet structures at various deposition times. Varying the deposition times can greatly affect the surface morphology from a group of nanoplatelets with a tube like structure to a densely packed nanoplatelet structure. From the SEM images, it can be concluded that the variation of deposition time influences the size and the shape of the CuS nanoplatelets.
EDX analysis was used to find the atomic weight ratio of the CuS CE on the FTO substrate obtained with deposition times of 50 min, 60 min, and 70 min. The bare CuS CE was obtained at 60 min deposition time. Fig. 6 shows the atomic percentage of copper and sulfur precursor sources, respectively. The atomic percentage of copper and sulfur was improved with the addition of HCl in the preparation of CuS. Here thioacetamide (TAA) played a dual role, being able to complex effectively with the copper ions as well as being the source of the sulfur in the presence of HCl. In this synthesis process, TAA hydrolyzes in the aqueous solution and releases sulfur ions slowly at different deposition times. The HCl acts as a complexing agent as well as improving the S2− concentration against S atoms. Copper sulfate reacts with the concentrated HCl very strongly and HCl is a strong inorganic acid so acts as a reagent in the oxidation–reduction reaction. The concentration and molar ratio of the Cu and S sources in the precursor solution play an important role in the film formation on the FTO substrate. The presence of more copper ions favored reaction with more sulfur ions, and the resulting SEM images are shown in Fig. 4b and c. The distribution maps of both copper and sulfur in the CuS show that they are uniformly distributed on the FTO substrate (within the HCl). The EDX results confirmed the formation of CuS on the FTO substrate in the presence of HCl without any other impurities. The reaction involves homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous particle growth and both copper and sulfur ions are formed in water. TAA was hydrolyzed by water to generate CH3CONH2 and H2S. Finally, H2S reacted with the copper ions to form crystalline copper sulfide.

The reaction follows the following mechanism. CuSO4 → Cu2+ + SO42−(1)
Thioacetamide reacts with H2O and dissociates to give H2S. CH3 − CS − NH2 + H2O → CH3 − CO − NH2 + H2S(2) H2S + H2O → SH− + H3O+(3) SH− + H2O → S2− + H3O+(4) Cu2+ + S2− → CuS(5)
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis was used to map the surface roughness and phase homogeneities of the CuS CEs at different deposition times. Fig. 7 shows the two-dimensional (2D) and corresponding three-dimensional (3D) AFM images of the thin film surfaces of CuS 50 min, 60 min, and 70 min. The AFM images show the formation of a rough surface with uniformly distributed nanoporous granular morphology. The root mean square roughness (Rrms) was 22.96, 36.32, and 25.55 nm for the CuS 50 min, 60 min, and 70 min samples, respectively. Upon increasing the deposition time, the nanoplatelets are aggregated to reduce the surface energy. Which means the nucleation and aggregation of nanoplatelets are normally slower in a non-aqueous solution. Increasing the deposition time from 50 min to 70 min, the Cu and S content were gradually increased, and the surface morphology showed many nanoplatelet structures or aggregates of platelets covering the surface.
 Fig. 7  2D (a, b, c) and 3D (a1, b1, c1) AFM images of CuS 50 min, CuS 60 min, and CuS 70 min CEs, respectively. 
Among all the CuS films, the CuS 60 min sample shows the largest Rrms value, which implies that it has the largest electrocatalytic surface area for the polysulfide electrolyte reduction. High apparent roughness on a CE enhances the electrocatalytic activity for a polysulfide electrolyte system.69,70 The surface roughness results also imply that the charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface would be lower in the CuS 60 min. This indicates that when increasing the deposition time, the surface roughness of CuS 60 min offers more electrocatalytic active sites for the reaction of the S2−/Sn2− redox couple in the electrolyte. The AFM results suggest that the performance of the CuS 60 min sample will greatly affect the conversion efficiency of the QDSSCs and the surface roughness of the thin film.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to compare the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface and clarify the electrochemical characteristics in catalyzing Sn2− reduction. We used symmetrical cells assembled with two identical electrodes (CE/electrolyte/CE). EIS is a valuable technique for describing electronic and charge transport characteristics, and Rct is a key factor for determining the FF of QDSSCs and DSSCs at the CE/electrolyte interface.26,62Fig. 8 presents the Nyquist plots for the symmetrical cells, which had an active area of 0.7 cm−2. Rct can be estimated from the impedance component of the high frequency semicircles. The equivalent circuit shows the series resistance (Rs) at high frequency intercept on the real axis, the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) with the constant phase angle element (CPE) at the CE/electrolyte interface in the middle frequency region, and the Nernst diffusion impedance (Zw) of the electrolyte in the low frequency region. The equivalent circuit in the inset of Fig. 8 was used to fit the Nyquist plots using Z-View software, and the fitting parameters are summarized in Table 1.

The deposition time of 60 min shows the best Rct (28.71), which indicates high charge transfer kinetics. This reduces the internal resistance of the CE film and ensures full utilization of the CuS nanoplatelets, which is consistent with the increased Jsc in Table 2.

ct values at the interface also impact upon the PCE. Due to inferior electron transfer kinetics for Sn2− reduction and corrosion of the Pt surface by S species, the Pt CE shows a higher Rct value than the CuS CEs. The low Rs values of CuS 50 min, CuS 60 min, CuS 70 min, and the Pt CE are 9.68, 7.65, 8.16, and 9.06 Ω respectively.64 The low value of CuS 60 min indicates superior electrical conductivity. In addition, the CuS 60 min provides a lower Zw value (11.76) than the other CEs. This is due to the exceptional nanoplatelet layer and the efficient diffusion of the polysulfide electrolyte, as shown in the SEM image in Fig. 4.
The increased FF may be attributed to the decreased Zw and Rs.51 The CPE (μF) values of the CuS 50 min, 60 min, 70 min, and Pt CEs were 21.16, 35.78, 27.40, and 5.62 μF, respectively. This reveals that the CuS CEs have higher CPE values than the Pt CE. Because of the low recombination and high surface area, we achieved a high Cμ value, which is also crucial for high electrocatalytic activity.15 The deposition times strongly influence the charge transfer resistance between the CE and the electrolyte. All these factors together contribute to the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the CuS CEs and improve the QDSSC performance. To understand more about the electrocatalytic activity the CuS thin films were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (ESI, Fig. S2†).
To better understand the electrocatalytic activity of the CEs, they were investigated by Tafel polarization measurements using symmetric dummy cells under dark conditions. Fig. 9 shows the Tafel polarization curves. When the voltage is zero, the exchange current density (J0) can be determined from the extrapolated intercepts of the anodic and cathodic branches of the Tafel curves. J0 can also be evaluated for the charge-transfer resistance according to the following equation: J0 = RT/nFRct(6)
 Fig. 9  Tafel polarization plot for CuS and Pt counter electrodes using symmetrical cells. 
Here R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature in K, n is the number of electrons involved in the electrolyte reduction, and F is the Faraday constant. Rct is inversely proportional to J0. Lower Rct and high J0 could provide higher electrocatalytic activity to the CEs. J0 values are consistent with the order of the Jsc values in Table 1. The limiting current density (Jlim) can be derived from the plot at high potential and is directly proportional to the diffusion coefficient (D) of the S2−/Sn2− redox couple. These two parameters are measures of the electrochemical catalytic activity. J0 depends on the Rct value obtained from the EIS analysis.
In the Tafel plot, the CuS CEs exhibit higher slopes than the Pt CE. As seen in the figure, CuS 60 min shows higher J0 and Jlim values, indicating higher diffusion velocity in the reduction of the electrolyte.76 Both J0 and Jlim gradually increased with the Cu/S atomic ratios, leading to better electrocatalytic activity and the highest efficiency of 4.06%. This is in good agreement with the EDX analysis (Fig. 6).
Higher J0 and Jlim values mean an ability to reduce the polysulfide electrolyte, higher diffusion coefficient, and lower Zw. Because of the high Jlim, the CuS CEs have good catalytic activity compared to Pt in the electrolyte reduction. Based on this result, it is much easier for CuS to catalyze the electrolyte reduction, and the electroactive materials with a higher exchange current density require low activation energy. In the Tafel plot, CuS 60 min shows a greater slope. Decreased charge transfer resistance in the EIS data was confirmed for the CuS nanoplatelet CEs, which have the highest catalytic activity for QDSSCs.
The optical band gap energy and characteristics of a semiconductor play a crucial role in the utilization of the materials in photovoltaic based solar cells. To further characterize the electrodes and the optical properties of the CuS CEs, we obtained UV-Vis absorption spectra of the QD-loaded CuS CEs in the presence of HCl and without HCl at different deposition times. Fig. 10 presents the absorption spectra of CuS without HCl and CuS CEs with HCl obtained in the wavelength range of 300 to 800 nm. In comparison to CuS without HCl, the absorption of the CuS CEs with HCl exhibits improvement at different levels in the range of visible light. Particularly, the HCl based CuS with 60 min deposition time presents a most significant increase in absorbance. Clearly, the increase of the absorbance could enhance the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) of QDSSCs. Obviously the addition of HCl could effectively increase the adsorption of light for the QD-loaded CuS nanoplatelet structure. The optical absorption was found to increase with the increase in the deposition times of CuS CEs from 50 min to 70 min. When increasing the deposition time from 50 min to 60 and 70 min, higher absorption intensities were observed, and the wavelength also increased to the range of 594–626 nm. CuS 60 min had broader absorption bands that were red-shifted compared to CuS 50 min. We estimated the band gap energies (Eg) to be 2.28, 2.08, and 1.98 eV, respectively, which are approximately the same as bulk CuS. Moreover, the longer wavelengths were attributed to free-carrier intraband absorption66,75 and molar extinction coefficients. They also indicate the uniform platelet size and morphology with fairly good crystallinity.

Fig. 11 presents the current-density–voltage (J–V) characteristics obtained under A.M 1.5 sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2) for QDSSCs with the different CuS CEs in the presence of HCl and without HCl, respectively. Table 2 shows the cell parameters (Jsc, FF, Voc, and PCE) extracted from the J–V curves. When increasing the deposition times of the CuS from 50 min to 70 min, gradual changes occurred in the photocurrent of the CuS CEs, which means the CuS 60 min deposition time affects the absorption of visible light and induces a high current density.

The Pt CE (η = 1.59%) shows very low performance because sulfides (S2−, Sx2−) adsorb onto the Pt surface and poison it, which affects the electrocatalytic activity and reduces the surface morphology71 and FF of the QDSSC.26 For optimization of efficient CuS CEs we prepared them without using hydrochloric acid (reagent), unfortunately there was no visible coating on the FTO substrate. With the presence of hydrochloric acid in the preparation of CuS CEs, we observed semitransparency with long term stability in the polysulfide electrolyte. The open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and efficiency (η) values of CuS 60 min are 0.602 V, 12.92 mA cm−2, 0.52, and 4.06%, respectively. The deposition time of CuS 60 min significantly improved the Jsc, Voc, and the FF, thereby increasing the efficiency of CuS compared to that of Pt as a CE for QDSSCs.
For the deposition times of 50 min, and 70 min, the PCEs are 3.81%, and 3.77%, respectively. When increasing the deposition times, we observed slight changes in Voc, Jsc, and FF of 0.598–0.584 V, 12.81–12.21 mA cm−2, and 0.49–0.52. The low performance of CuS 50 and 70 min are mainly attributed to the higher series resistance (Rs) and electrocatalytic activity of the cell in comparison with that of CuS 60 min. The Jsc mainly depends upon light harvesting efficiency, charge collection efficiency and electron and hole injection efficiency.72 This occurred because of the much better conductivity of the FTO substrate, which was proven by the EIS and Tafel polarization analysis.
The improved performance of CuS 60 min increased the charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface, and reduced the internal resistance, recombination rates, and concentration of gradients in the electrolyte,73,74 resulting in improved FF, Jsc, and η. The photovoltaic performance of the CuS CEs improves up to 60 min of deposition and greatly decreases thereafter. The photovoltaic performance of the QDSSCs with CuS 60 min deposition time is much better than that of the other CEs when using a polysulfide electrolyte. This demonstrates that CuS 60 min is the best alternative to the Pt CE. The J–V results suggest that CuS 60 min has excellent electrocatalytic activity for the polysulfide electrolyte and it is suitable as an efficient CE in QDSSCs. For better understanding of the J–V performance of CuS CEs and the enhanced redox reaction at the CE/electrolyte interface, we have conducted cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis with fresh electrolyte using 0.1 M KCl, 0.1 M Na2S, and 0.1 M S, in the presence of HCl and without HCl, respectively (ESI, Fig. S2†).
To identify the electron transport behavior and the electrocatalytic activity of QDSSCs based on the different CEs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 was used. Fig. 12 shows the EIS spectra of QDSSCs based CuS CEs. The corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 3. A 10 mV AC signal was applied with a frequency range of 100 mHz to 500 kHz with a bias of Voc (under light conditions). Z-view software was used to analyze the impedance spectra from the EIS analysis with an equivalent circuit consisting of two parallel RC circuits along with the Warburg impedance (Zw). As shown in Fig. 12(b) series resistance (Rs) was added to the circuit to identify the sheet resistance of the FTO represented by the nonzero intercept on the real axis on the impedance plot. RCE is represented by the single semi-circle along the real axis (high frequency region) at the CE/polysulfide electrolyte interface. RCT represents the charge transfer resistance at the photoanode/electrolyte interface and is parallel to the chemical capacitance, which represents the large number of photo-excited charge carriers in the conduction band of the photoanode resulting from very poor recombination. The diffusion impedance (Zw) obtained from the end of the small semi-circle indicates the diffusion resistance of the electrolyte.

The RCE values of CuS 50 min, 60 min, 70 min, and the Pt CE were 12.92, 2.25, 15.7, and 21.48, respectively. CuS 60 min has the lowest RCE value, which indicates higher electrocatalytic activity than the other CEs. The RCE value of the Pt CE is much higher than that of the other films because of the greater internal energy loss at the CE/electrolyte interface leading to the lower FF.76 The RCE values for CuS 50 min and 70 min are far higher than that of CuS 60 min, showing that RCE strongly depends on the deposition time.
The high Cμ value (604.7 μF) of the CuS 60 min sample is shown to be superior to that of other CEs. The greater Cμ value suggests a higher surface area of the electrode, which leads to better electrocatalytic activity.77–79 The lowest Zw value (7.03) indicates more electrolyte diffusion, resulting in an increased FF (0.52). CuS 60 min exhibited the smallest charge transfer resistance and highest chemical capacitance, which indicates faster charge transport at the interface of the photoanode, electrolyte, and the QDs.
In accordance with the EIS model, we can also estimate the electron lifetime (τn) in the CuS CEs for QDSSCs. The corresponding Bode phase plots for the CuS 50 min, 60 min, 70 min, and Pt CEs are shown in Fig. 12(c). The electron lifetimes can be obtained from the peak angular frequency value (fmax) using the following equation: τn = 1/(2πfmax)(7)
The τn values of the CuS 50 min, 60 min, 70 min, and Pt CEs are 0.10, 11.4, 0.07, and 0.03 ms, respectively. Moreover, the lower τn value of CuS 60 min suggests that the electrons have a longer lifetime and are effectively transferred, resulting in higher Jsc and energy conversion efficiency for the QDSSCs. The QDSSC with the Pt CE exhibits very low electron lifetime due to the higher Zw value and more recombination for the polysulfide electrolyte, which results in an extreme loss of FF and affects the performance of QDSSCs.70 When increasing the deposition times, increased Jsc and Cμ could decrease Rct and Zw and result in good electron transport behavior and electrocatalytic activity of the counter electrode.
The open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) was used to investigate the charge transport and recombination properties of the CuS CEs as shown in Fig. 13. The OCDV measurements were carried out by monitoring the transient Voc during relaxation from illumination to an illuminated quasi-equilibrium state and to the dark equilibrium. When the visible light illumination is removed from a QDSSC in an open circuit, no electrons are transported through an external circuit. Due to recombination, the photoinduced electrons all recombine with the electron acceptors in the polysulfide electrolyte. Therefore, Voc would follow an exponential decay during the recombination process.
 Fig. 13  Open-circuit voltage-decay measurements after switching off the illumination of the QDSSCs. 
Based on the CuS amounts, light scattering ability, electron transport, and recombination, CuS 60 min shows the highest PCE of 4.06% with a Jsc of 12.92 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.60 mV, and a FF of 0.52 under simulated AM 1.5 G one-sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). Increasing the deposition time from 60 min to 70 min leads to higher recombination kinetics, which means a shorter electron lifetime for the QDSSCs. The CuS 70 min has the fastest voltage decay rate, indicating the largest recombination rate. These results are in agreement with the SEM, EIS, and AFM studies. It is clear that the QDSSC based on CuS 60 min has the slowest Voc decay rate (Fig. 14).

4. Conclusion
We demonstrated a new synthetic and cost-effective approach to prepare CuS CEs on a FTO substrate by a simple and inexpensive CBD method with HCl using different deposition times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of fabricating horizontally aligned CuS CEs with HCl-improved nanoplatelet morphology on a FTO substrate for QDSSCs. Both Jsc and Voc were improved, and the CuS films became progressively richer. In QDSSCs, the CuS 60 min showed higher short-current density (12.92 mA cm−2), open-circuit voltage (0.60 V), and fill factor (0.52), yielding a superior PCE of 4.06% under one-sun illumination.
The CuS 60 min also showed low charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface, which results in excellent electrocatalytic activity and higher energy conversion efficiency compared to the other CEs. This is due to the improved photocatalytic properties and enhanced light harvesting at high wavelength. The growth process of the CuS nanoplatelets can be controlled by changing the deposition times in the presence of HCl. It was established that deposition times had an important role in the formation of CuS nanoplatelet structures. The experimental procedure is also quite simple and may pave the way for further QDSSC development.
