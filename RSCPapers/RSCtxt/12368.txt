    , Accepted 12th June 2019First published on 13th June 2019AbstractThe development of a wide bandgap polymer for the preparation of high-performance fullerene-free polymer solar cells (PSCs) has been a hot topic. PBDT-PhI is a typical wide band gap polymer, which has been initially reported in our previous study (Polym. Chem., 2013, 4, 2174) and recently applied in fullerene-free PSCs, affording the efficiency of 8.31% (Macromolecules, 2017, 50, 8928). In this study, by judiciously selecting acceptors and systematic device optimizations, we promoted the efficiencies of PBDT-PhI-based fullerene-free PSCs beyond 10% for the first time. We first selected a series of commercial acceptors, e.g., IT-4F, ITIC, ITCT, and IEICO-4F, to match PBDT-PhI. Good complementary absorption was observed between PBDT-PhI and the four acceptors. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) tests revealed suitable energy level alignments between PBDT-PhI and the acceptors, except for IEICO-4F; primary device preparation was carried out using chloroform (CF) as the spin-coating solvent and 1,8-diiodoocane (DIO) as the additive, and the efficiencies of 8.18%, 7.99%, 8.86%, and 3.90% for IT-4F, ITIC, ITCT, and IEICO-4F, respectively, were obtained. Based on PBDT-PhI/ITCT, further device optimizations were conducted using high-boiling point chlorobenzene (CB) and CB/CF mixed solvents to spin-coat the active layers, and the enhanced efficiencies of 9.17% and 10.17%, respectively, were obtained. The best performance of the PBDT-PhI/ITCT-based devices prepared using the CB/CF mix solvent was ascribed to the highest charge dissociation rates and the weakest recombination losses.
1. Introduction
Fullerene derivatives, e.g., PC61BM and PC71BM, have occupied the mainstream position of acceptor materials for organic solar cells (OSCs) for a long time.1–6 However, intrinsic drawbacks, such as weak absorption in the visible region, limited tunability of energy levels, and tough purification processes, drove the fast development of non-fullerene acceptor materials e.g., various conjugated small molecules and polymers with strong and wide absorption bands, tailorable frontier orbital energy levels, and favorable aggregation properties.7–10 Among these, particular successes were achieved for fused ring acceptors, featured with ladder-type cores and electron-withdrawing end groups, for example, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-n-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3d:2′,3′d′]-s-indaceno[1,2b:5,6b′]dithiophene (ITIC), which was initially invented by Zhan et al.11 After this, significant efforts have been devoted towards the structural tailoring of backbones, side chains, and end groups on these fused ring acceptors, leading to a large number of derivatives, opening an effective pathway towards the achievement of high-performance fullerene-free solar cells.12–23 Typically, fused ring acceptors have strong absorption bands at longer wavelengths of the visible region (600–800 nm), suitable energy levels, and good self-assembly properties. Considering the bulk-heterojunction features of OSC devices, i.e., blends of electron-donor and electron-acceptor materials as active layers, a matchable electron donor is a prerequisite for high-efficiency fullerene-free OSCs. Moreover, the development of donor materials, especially polymer donors due to their good processability and film-forming properties, is critical and has an equal importance as that of non-fullerene acceptor materials for the realization of high-performance fullerene-free polymer solar cells (PSCs).
To fully cover the solar radiation spectrum and sufficiently harvest the photons in the visible region (300–800 nm), donor polymers with a complementary absorption (300–600 nm) to the coverage of fused ring acceptors (600–800 nm) are particularly required. In this regard, wide band gap (WBG) polymers with absorption edges around or before 600 nm, corresponding to the band gaps of ca. 2.0 eV, are desirable.24 Moreover, proper energy level alignments, for example, at least 0.3 eV of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) offset and necessary highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) offset, between the donor and acceptor are of vital importance to exciton dissociation.2,25–29 In addition, high and balanced hole/electron mobilities and favorable donor/acceptor (D/A) blend morphologies play an essential role in charge extraction and collection.30–32 The charge transport and film morphology are related to not only molecular structures but also device technics, especially the spin-coating conditions including solvents, additives, and annealing.3,33–37 In conjunction with device optimizations, a series of excellent WBG polymers, e.g., PBDB-T and its derivatives, PTB7-Th, J52, and PDBT-EF-T, with band gaps in the range of 1.8–2.0 eV were developed to match these fused ring acceptors, accomplishing the state-of-the-art power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of >13% for single-junction solar cells.21,32,38–44
In 2013, we reported a WBG polymer, named PBDT-PhI, (Scheme 1) based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and phthalimide (PhI) units with the optical band gap of ca. 2.0 eV, a strong absorption band at 300–600 nm, and a noticeable hole mobility of 1.44 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 tested by organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) devices.45 When PC71BM was used as the acceptor material, PBDT-PhI exhibited the PCE of 3.7%. No further photovoltaic applications regarding PBDT-PhI were reported until 2017 when Guo et al. applied it in fullerene-free PSCs.46 By incorporating the non-fullerene acceptor IDIC, a strikingly improved PCE of 8.31% was afforded. However, there is still a significant scope for PCE improvement of PBDT-PhI as compared to the case of these high-efficiency WBG polymers, which commonly display efficiencies beyond 10%;42,47–52 the fast development of a tool-box for the non-fullerene acceptors has motivated us to work towards the further promotion of the PCE for fullerene-free PSCs based on PBDT-PhI. This study focuses on the realization of high-performance fullerene-free PSCs enabled with PBDT-PhI based on two considerations: (a) the rich tool-box of ITIC derivatives demonstrate that acceptors should be screened in terms of energy level alignments and a complementary absorption to achieve an optimal acceptor for PBDT-PhI; (b) systematic device optimizations, including those of D/A ratios, additive contents, and spin-coating solvents, are useful for the further enhancement of the efficiencies via control of film morphology and charge mobilities. Especially, the spin-coating solvents with different boiling points can critically control the micro-morphology of the blend films and have been extensively studied.3,30,36,53–55 Accordingly, in this study, we first selected a series of excellent acceptors, e.g., IT-4F, ITIC, ITCT, and IEICO-4F (Scheme 1),38,56–59 all of which were commercially available, to match PBDT-PhI. The suitability of the acceptors was evaluated in terms of energy level alignments and complementary absorption. Among these acceptors, ITCT provided the best PCE of 8.86% due to its suitable energy level alignments. Then, the champion device based on PBDT-PhI:ITCT was further optimized by selecting proper spin-coating solvents, for example, chloroform, chlorobenzene, and mixed solvents, and the high efficiency of 10.17% was obtained. This is the first study on the promotion of the efficiencies of PBDT-PhI-based fullerene-free PSCs beyond 10%.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Energy levels and optical absorption
Considering the D/A match point, suitable energy levels alignments are a prerequisite for device operation. For PBDT-PhI and acceptors, i.e., IT-4F, ITIC, ITCT, and IEICO-4F, although frontier orbital energy levels have been tested and revealed in different studies using various methods, the errors that originated from different equipment and estimation methods have encouraged us to re-test them under unified conditions. Both ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S3, ESI†) were conducted to estimate the energy levels. For the UPS tests, the HOMO levels were calculated from EHOMO = Ecutoff − Eonset − hν, where the Ecutoff and Eonset were obtained from the UPS spectra, and hν was 21.22 eV. LUMOs were calculated by Eoptg + EHOMO. The results are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†) and shown in Fig. 1a. As observed from the UPS/Eoptg results, PBDT-PhI displayed the deep-lying HOMO of −5.40 eV and high-lying LUMO of −3.34 eV, which were beneficial to exciton separation and helpful for finding high open circuit voltage (Voc), respectively. For the acceptors, all the LUMOs were deeper than the LUMO of PBDT-PhI by at least 0.8 eV; this indicated a strong driving force for electron transfer from PBDT-PhI to the acceptors. In parallel, the HOMOs of IT-4F, ITIC, and ITCT were significantly deeper than the HOMO of PBDT-PhI by at least 0.31 eV, offering sufficient driving force for hole transfer from the acceptors to the donor. IEICO-4F shows a HOMO (−5.53 eV) close to the HOMO (−5.40 eV) of PBDT-PhI, which may be unfavorable for hole transfer. For IT-4F and IEICO-4F, the deep LUMOs of −4.22 and −4.23 eV were observed, respectively, due to the strong electron-drawing nature of the fluorinated end-groups, which were unfavorable for obtaining high Voc values. The UPS tests indicated that the acceptors possessed suitably aligned energy levels that matched those of PBDT-PhI, except for IEICO-4F having an extremely high-lying HOMO. The CV tests were calibrated by ferrocene (Fc), and the HOMOs and LUMOs were estimated from the equation EHOMO/LUMO = −[4.8 − E(Fc/Fc+) + E(ox/rex)] eV. In general, the LUMOs determined by CV showed a similar trend to the results calculated by UPS/Eoptg, whereas the HOMOs determined by UPS and those determined by the CV results were different. For example, based on the UPS results, the HOMOs for ITIC (−5.71 eV) and ITCT (−5.77 eV) were close to each other, which would be further confirmed by the theoretical simulations (vide post). On the other hand, the CV results revealed obviously different HOMOs for ITIC (−5.44 eV) and ITCT (−5.67 eV). This may be ascribed to the effects of solvents, electrodes and other uncertain factors in the CV tests. Indeed, contrary to the CV results, the UPS/Eoptg results supported the OPV data better. This has been discussed in the photovoltaic section. Accordingly, in this study, the UPS/Eoptg results were trusted more while evaluating the energy levels.

Note: in the energy level diagram, solid lines and the former numbers represent the results estimated from UPS and optical band gaps (Eoptg), whereas the dotted lines and the numbers in brackets illustrate the results deduced from the CV. 
The film absorption spectra of pristine PBDT-PhI, acceptors, and blends in the films were investigated. All the four D/A blends provided fabulous complementary absorption profiles with PBDT-PhI/IT-4F (Fig. 1b), PBDT-PhI/ITIC (Fig. 1c), and PBDT-PhI/ITCT (Fig. 1d) covering 300–800 nm and PBDT-PhI/IEICO-4F (Fig. 1e) covering 300–1000 nm. Pristine PBDT-PhI showed the maximum absorption strength, i.e., absorbance per 100 nm, of 0.63. IT-4F, ITIC, ITCT, and IEICO-4F exhibited the maximum absorbance of 1.36, 1.69, 1.06, and 1.55, respectively. However, after these acceptors were blended with PBDT-PhI, the maximum absorbance sharply decreased to 0.63, 0.80, and 0.82 for IT-4F, ITIC, and IEICO-4F, respectively. Exclusively, ITCT displayed a strong absorbance of 1.00 in the blend film, close to the value of pristine ITCT (1.06); this indicated that upon incorporation into PBDT-PhI, the packing order of ITCT was not disrupted.
Theoretical simulations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level to predict the energy levels and electronic nature of PBDT-PhI and the four acceptors. For PBDT-PhI, one repeating unit, namely BDT-PhI, was selected to represent the polymer for simulations. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the HOMO and LUMO of BDT-PhI split obviously with the HOMO located on the BDT unit and the LUMO mainly distributed on the PhI unit; for IT-4F, ITIC, and ITCT, the LUMO was scattered over the entire conjugated backbone, whereas the HOMO was absent on the end-capped thiophene or phenyl units due to their similar HOMO energy levels, as demonstrated in the results of the UPS tests. The theoretical band gap of PBDT-PhI (2.79 eV) was close to the electrochemical band gap (2.81 eV), whereas for the acceptors, the theoretical values were slightly larger than the electrochemical values. The electrostatic potential surface (EPS) maps are shown in Fig. 2c. The PBDT-PhI backbone shows an obvious electronegativity corresponding to its electron-rich nature, whereas the acceptor backbones evidently exhibit electropositive features, indicating their strong electron-deficient property, which can offer strong driving force for electron transfer from PBDT-PhI to the acceptors.

2.2 Photovoltaic performance
Photovoltaic devices based on PBDT-PhI and these acceptors were prepared with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al. Chloroform (CF) was selected as the spin-coating solvent, and the high-boiling point additives 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and chloronaphthalene (CN) were applied to assist the film-forming processes. For IT-4F, both DIO and CN were applied individually, and the optimized contents were screened (Table S2, ESI†). The optimal devices with the addition of DIO and CN afforded the best PCE of 8.18% and 7.94%, respectively. For the ITIC-based devices, the champion PCE was 7.99% when 0.5% (v/v) of DIO was added (Table S3, ESI†). For IEICO-4F, the inferior PCE of 3.90% was obtained although DIO was applied to the spin-coating processes (Table S4, ESI†). Interestingly, for ITCT, the high efficiency of 8.86% was accomplished when the active layer was spin-coated with CF/DIO (1% v/v) (Table S5, ESI†). Accordingly, the results for the champion devices obtained using the acceptors IT-4F, ITIC, ITCT, and IEICO-4F, CF and high-boiling point solvents are summarized in Table 1, and the J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3. It is obvious that IT-4F and IEICO-4F provide inferior Voc due to their low-lying LUMO energy levels of −4.22 and −4.23 eV, respectively. IEICO-4F also generally showed poor Jsc, FF, and PCE, partially owing to its unfavorable energy level alignments to PBDT-PhI. Fortunately, IT-4F, ITIC, and ITCT exhibited the high efficiencies of 8.18%, 7.99%, and 8.86%, respectively, suggesting great potential to break the efficiency of 10%. The voltage loss (Vloss) determined by Eg/q − Voc was estimated to discuss the device performance. Although a variety of methods have been revealed to calculate the Eg value,60 making it hard to compare the Vloss among different material systems, herein, we selected a feasible and commonly used method, i.e., calculation of the optical band gaps of the D/A blend films to determine the Eg values (Fig. S4, ESI†). As summarized in Table 1, a high Vloss (0.67 eV) for the IT-4F-based devices corresponding to the low Voc of 0.86 V resulted in a relatively high Jsc (15.98 mA cm−2). In contrast, a high Voc (0.99 V) for the ITIC-based devices leading to the low Vloss of 0.62 eV afforded the relatively low Jsc of 13.17 mA cm−2. The ITCT-based devices exhibited a favorable compromise between Voc and Jsc, thus obtaining highest efficiency. For the IEICO-4F-based devices, although Vloss was small, the low Jsc of 9.25 mA cm−2 was observed. From a structural point of view, fine-tuning of the chemical structure of PBDT-PhI was required to reduce Vloss without sacrificing Jsc.61

To further promote the photovoltaic performance of the IT-4F, ITIC, and ITCT-based devices, more solvents with different boiling points were utilized to spin-coat the active layers. For IT-4F, the high-boiling point solvents chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) were applied to spin-coat the active layers. However, inferior performances were observed for these devices as compared to the performances of the CF-processed devices (Table S6, ESI†). For ITIC, CB was employed with different contents of DIO (Table S7, ESI†). However, the performances were generally worse than that of the CF spin-coated devices. Encouragingly, when CB/DIO (1% v/v) was applied, the devices based on PBDT-PhI/ITCT displayed the further improved efficiency of 9.17% (Table S8, ESI†) as compared to the efficiency of the CF/DIO (1% v/v)-processed devices (8.86%). Inspired by this effective strategy, mixed solvents of CB/CF were also attempted, and the optimal solvent ratio of CB:CF was screened to be 2:1 (Table S9, ESI†). Based on this solvent ratio, we further optimized the DIO contents. As shown in Table S10 (ESI†), when the mixed solvents of CB/CF (2:1 v/v) and DIO (1% v/v) were used to spin-coat the active layers of PBDT-PhI/ITCT, the device afforded the high efficiency of 10.17%, with the Voc of 0.92 V, the Jsc of 16.67 mA cm−2, and the FF of 66.30%. The photovoltaic parameters of the PBDT-PhI/ITCT-based devices deduced from the three solvent systems CF, CB, and the CB/CF mixture with 1% (v/v) DIO additives are shown in Table 2, and the corresponding J–V curves are displayed in Fig. 4a. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the three corresponding devices showed broad (300–800 nm) and strong responses (Fig. 4b). Herein, we promoted the efficiencies of PBDT-PhI-based fullerene-free devices beyond 10% for the first time, sufficiently opening up the photovoltaic potential of PBDT-PhI.

2.3 Charge generation, dissociation, transport, and recombination loss
From Table 2, it is obvious that the spin-coating solvents can finely tune the photovoltaic parameters of the PBDT-PhI/ITCT-based devices. The CB/CF mix solvent provided similar FF values but apparently improved the Jsc values as compared to that of the devices prepared from the pristine CF and CB solvents. As the Jsc and FF are critically determined by the exciton generation, dissociation, transport, recombination, and collection, a series of device characterizations have been conducted to gain an insight into these physical processes. At first, the hole and electron mobilities of the devices prepared with different solvents were tested by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S5, ESI†). The active layers were processed under exactly the same conditions as those used for devices that presented the best photovoltaic performances. The test details are described in the experimental section. As summarized in Table 3, the three devices prepared from CF, CB, and CB/CF provided similar hole/electron mobilities on the magnitude of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The same magnitude and balanced hole/electron mobilities determined the similar FF values for the three devices. The photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of the effective voltage (Veff) was tested to study charge dissociation and collection in the three devices. The Jph is defined as JL–JD, where JL and JD are the current densities measured under illumination and dark conditions, respectively. The Veff is defined as V0–Vapp, where Vapp is the applied voltage and V0 is the compensation voltage, which is defined as the voltage when Jph = 0 mA cm−2.62,63 As shown in Fig. 5a, the Jph was saturated at Veff > 1.5 V due to the minimized charge recombination at the high internal electric field. The charge dissociation probability (Pdiss) in the devices can be estimated from the ratio of the photocurrent density (Jph) and the saturated photocurrent density (Jsat) (Jph/Jsat). The Pdiss values for the devices prepared with CF, CB, and CB/CF were estimated to be 94%, 90%, and 96%, respectively, under the short-circuit condition. The highest Pdiss value for the device prepared with the CB/CF mix solvent indicated its more efficient charge dissociation and collection than that of the devices spin-coated from pristine CF and CB.

The dependence of the photocurrent at the short-circuit (Jsc) and the photovoltage at the open-circuit (Voc) on the light intensity (I) was tested to study monomolecular/bimolecular recombination losses. At the short-circuit, most of the generated holes and electrons were swept out of the devices before recombination. Generally, the Jsc and I followed the equation Jsc ∝ Iα. When the α value was close to 1, monomolecular recombination dominated in the devices, and the bimolecular recombination could be ignored.64,65Fig. 5b shows the Jsc–I curves of the devices prepared with different solvents. The α values for the devices prepared with CF, CB, and CB/CF were calculated to be 0.979, 0.950, and 0.993, respectively. The devices prepared with the CB/CF mix solvent revealed an α value closest to unity, indicating its weakest bimolecular recombination under the short-circuit condition. At the open-circuit, all the generated charges recombined in the devices, and the Voc and I followed the equation Voc ∝ nkT/qlnI, where k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, Kelvin temperature, and elementary charge, respectively. When the n value was close to 1, the bimolecular recombination dominated in the devices, whereas when n deviated from unity, the monomolecular recombination losses dominated.64–66 The n values for the devices prepared with CF, CB, and CB/CF were estimated to be 1.42, 1.36, and 1.27, respectively (Fig. 5c). The devices prepared with CB/CF displayed an n value closest to unity, indicating its weakest monomolecular recombination under the open-circuit condition. In general, the weakest recombination losses for the devices spin-coated with CB/CF endowed it with largest Jsc and PCE values.
2.4 Micro-morphology and molecular packing properties
The micro-morphologies of the PBDT-PhI/ITCT active layers spin-coated with different solvents were studied by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 6, from CF, CB, to CB/CF, the phase sizes of the active layers decreased from 50–80 nm, 30–50 nm, to 10–30 nm, respectively. The AFM height images (Fig. S6, ESI†) showed the surface roughness of 3.37, 1.90, and 1.74 nm for the active layers spin-coated with CF, CB, and CB/CF, respectively, indicating a gradually increased D/A miscibility. The smallest phase sizes and best D/A miscibility for the devices prepared with CB/CF were consistent with the highest charge dissociation probability and the weakest re-combination losses, leading to highest Jsc and PCE values.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted to study the molecular packing properties of the active layers. Fig. 7 shows the XRD patterns, and Table S11 (ESI†) summarizes the d-spacings of the interchain packing (100) and π–π interaction (010) deduced from 2dsinθ = λ; herein, λ = 1.5418 Å. The pristine PBDT-PhI showed the interchain packing distance of 20.27 Å and the π–π distance of 3.62 Å. The pure ITCT film displayed the weak 100 and 010 diffraction signals at 2θ = 4.36° and 24.58° corresponding to the d-spacings of 18.00 Å and 3.41 Å. The PBDT-PhI/ITCT blend film spin-coated from CF exhibited the obvious 100 and 010 peaks at 2θ = 4.85° and 25.07° corresponding to the d-spacings of 18.22 Å and 3.55 Å. When the spin-coating solvent was changed to CB, the smaller π–π packing distance of 3.39 Å was observed, which could presumably be ascribed to the compact ITCT packing, consistent with the improved electron mobility. For the blend film spin-coated with the CB/CF mix solvent, strong 100 and 010 diffractions were noticed, corresponding to the lamellar distance of 20.00 Å and 3.40 Å. This indicated an ordered 3D stacking, in good agreement with the highest hole/electron mobilities and the enhanced efficiency of 10.17%.

3. Conclusions
Herein, a wide band gap donor polymer, namely PBDT-PhI, was synthesized according to our previous study and applied to fullerene-free PSCs by selecting a series of commercially available acceptor materials e.g., IT-4F, ITIC, ITCT, and IEICO-4F. The UV-Vis absorption spectra indicated that PBDT-PhI showed a complementary absorption profile to all four acceptors. The UPS tests revealed that PBDT-PhI displayed suitable energy levels with the acceptors, except for IEICO-4F. Fullerene-free PSCs based on PBDT-PhI and the four acceptors were prepared using chloroform (CF) with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the additive. Via optimizing the DIO ratios, the champion devices with PBDT-PhI as the donor material and IT-4F, ITIC, ITCT, and IEICO-4F as the acceptor materials exhibited the efficiencies of 8.18%, 7.99%, 8.86%, and 3.90%, respectively. Further optimization of the PBDT-PhI/ITCT-based devices was conducted using the high-boiling solvent chlorobenzene (CB) and CB/CF mixture solvents. By adding 1% (v/v) DIO as the additive, the devices prepared using CB and CB/CF afforded the efficiencies of 9.17% and 10.17%, respectively. The devices spin-coated from the CB/CF mix solvent with DIO as the additive exhibited best efficiency due to their highest exciton dissociation rates and weakest recombination losses. This is the first study on the promotion of the efficiency of PBDT-PhI-based fullerene-free PSCs beyond 10%.
