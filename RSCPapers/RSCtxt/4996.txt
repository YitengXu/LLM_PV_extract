    , Accepted 15th March 2017First published on 17th March 2017AbstractWith demands placed on batteries constantly increasing, new positive electrode materials with higher energy density, satisfactory power density, and long-term cycling capabilities, composed of highly abundant elements with low-cost, are desired. One such low-cost cathodic material is iron(III) fluoride – FeF3. Its theoretical capacity for single-electron reduction, accompanied by the insertion of Li+ ions, is 237 mA h g−1. Herein we present a new synthesis for nanocrystalline FeF3 using inexpensive iron trifluoroacetate as a molecular single-source precursor. We also report an adaptation of this simple chemistry to several transition metal difluorides (M = Fe, Co, and Mn). With FeF3, a high capacity of 220 mA h g−1 was attained at a moderate current density of 100 mA g−1 (∼0.5 C). In addition to high capacity, we see the evidence for high rate-capability. Capacities of up to 155 mA h g−1 were observed with 1-minute (10 A g−1) charge–discharge ramps, and at least 88% of this capacity was retained after 100 cycles. When tested as a sodium cathode, FeF3 exhibits capacities of up to 160 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 200 mA h g−1.
Introduction
The efficient storage of electrical energy in a reversible electrochemical reaction – e.g. in a battery – is of paramount importance for a sustainable future of our civilization.1,2 The increasing variety of applications for batteries demands, on one hand, much better performance and, on the other hand, both reduction in cost and an increase in the use of naturally abundant elements. Improvements in performance can be realized either in terms of energy density, power density, safety or long-term cycling stability, with the relative weight of each of these criteria determined by the specific application (i.e. for portable electronics, electric mobility, etc.). Reduction in cost and an increase in the usage of naturally abundant chemical components become critical factors for the large-scale deployment of batteries as stationary storage devices for electricity generated by renewable resources such as solar or wind. All of these considerations have led to a new wave of research into the basic components of batteries – electrode materials and electrolytes – as well as to the exploration of new electrochemical systems such as Na-ion batteries. The latter are one example of a post-Li-ion technology that fits the needs of both performance and cost/abundance. Sodium has an almost unlimited abundance in the earth's crust and, with only minor losses, yields an ultimate anodic potential of ca. 0.3 V.2–4
Consequently, low-cost iron-based electrode materials would be highly desirable for any kind of battery. Iron trifluoride, FeF3, has a theoretical charge storage capacity of 237 mA h g−1 for the one-electron reaction which forms FeF2 and LiF (or NaFeF3). Considering its corresponding electrode potential of 3.25 V vs. Li, such electrodes would offer an energy density of up to 770 W h kg−1. This, by comparison, is greater than that of the only iron-based electrode material currently in commercial use: LiFePO4 (170 mA h g−1, 3.4 V, giving an energy density of 578 W h kg−1).5 Similar theoretical energy densities are also found in other commercial Li-ion cathodes: LiCoO2 (546 W h kg−1), LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (NMC, 610 W h kg−1), and LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA, 680 W h kg−1). Even greater charge-storage capacities of up to 712 mA h g−1 might be within reach through a three-electron conversion reaction in which Fe and LiF are formed upon discharge. Other less ionic Fe compounds, such as nitrides, oxides or sulfides, exhibit lower average discharge voltages (<2 V vs. Li) and therefore are not well-suited as cathodes.6,7 However, an apparent disadvantage of FeF3, as compared to conventional commercial LiCoO2, NMC, NCA, and LiFePO4 cathode materials, is that there is no Li (or Na) in the FeF3 before discharging. Hence it can be combined neither with graphite as a Li-anode nor with non-lithiated materials such as hard-carbon (typical Na anodes) to form conventional “rocking chair” systems.
This problem might, however, be fully resolved through the use of emerging anode materials such as pre-lithiated Si8 or stabilized, dendrite-free metallic Li (Na) anodes.9 One hurdle facing the use of FeF3 lies in its more ionic nature, which causes a larger band gap and makes this material an electronic insulator. Bulk FeF3 is therefore a poorly performing cathode material with reported capacities limited to 80 mA h g−1.10 One strategy to mitigate this challenge involved embedding FeF3 into highly conductive materials to facilitate efficient electronic transport to the active material. This was successfully shown with carbon black, graphite, graphene, and graphene oxide additives11–18 and with inorganic (MoS2, Fe3O4, and V2O5)19–22 and conductive polymeric coatings.23,24 Another reported strategy is substitutional electronic doping with titanium.25 In addition, most of these publications point to another key enabler – the reduction of particle size. This reduces the electron diffusion path length and increases the surface area, thereby lowering the polarization and allowing for faster charge transfer. Initially, a low-cost and effective top-down method — high-energy ball milling of the bulk material — was a commonly reported nanostructuring method for FeF3.17,18,26 More recently, bottom-up chemical approaches such as sol–gel methods,11,27 solvothermal methods,28 ionic co-precipitation in ionic liquids,29 mechanochemical solid-state reactions,30 electrochemical in situ preparation,14 and thermal dehydration of FeF3·(H2O)3 (ref. 31 and 32) have appeared along with the ability to readily synthesize well-defined nanostructures, such as nanowires.33 Many of these reports have also shown the potential of FeF3 to act as a cathode material in Li-ion batteries. Some reports also contain studies on Na-ion insertion,14,34 and these generally point to substantial differences between Na- and Li-electrochemical behavior, namely, lower Na-ion capacities and lower power densities. Besides pure FeF3, promising Li-ion electrochemical results were obtained with a related material, FeF3·(H2O)0.33.35,36 This shows good reversibility but has a slightly lower theoretical capacity due to the additional weight of water. Besides electrochemical applications, such well-defined FeF3 may also find other uses as a catalyst for hydrogen storage,37 in organic chemistry,38–40 or in lubricating oils.41 In our assessment of the available literature, we have found that a scalable, facile and low-cost chemical synthesis of chemically and phase-pure nanoscopic FeF3 still remains a formidable challenge.
In this work, we present a novel synthetic route towards FeF3, FeF2 and several other metal fluorides (MnF2 and CoF2) by the decomposition of single-source molecular precursors (metal trifluoroacetates), yielding powders with small grain sizes of about 10 nm. For this, several new metal trifluoroacetate compounds were synthesized and their structures were determined with single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In addition to the chemical and structural analysis of these metal fluorides, we also present their electrochemical characterization in which Li-ion charge storage capacities which are close to theoretical values, good rate capabilities, satisfactory coulombic efficiencies and a capacity retention of 88% after 100 cycles are observed. With regard to Na-ion storage, a high specific capacity of 150 mA h g−1 was obtained.
Experimental
Synthesis

Synthesis of “Fe(TFA)3” and “Co(TFA)2”. 
FeCl3 (8 g, 0.05 mol) was combined with trifluoroacetic acid (67 mL, 0.88 mol, TFA) and trifluoroacetic acid anhydride (40 mL, 0.28 mol) in a 250 mL two-neck flask equipped with a double-mantled 30 cm long Dimroth cooler. The reaction mixture was refluxed at 86 °C for 48 hours under nitrogen flow. A white suspension was obtained. After cooling to room temperature (RT), the unreacted acid was removed by vacuum-distillation yielding the final product – a white powder (16.87 g, Fig. 1a). “Fe(TFA)3” was immediately transferred into an Ar-filled glovebox (O2, H2O < 0.1 ppm) for further use. For this, the reaction flask was evacuated and closed before disconnecting from the Schlenk line. Due to this compound's high hygroscopicity, even short exposure of “Fe(TFA)3” to air leads to the appearance of a red color, which is found to be unsuitable as a precursor to FeF3. We were, however, unable to grow large single crystals of this novel precursor for structural determination, as it tends to be poorly crystalline/nanocrystalline as observed from powder XRD (Fig. 1b). Similarly, we were able to obtain poly-crystalline “Co(TFA)2” (see the experimental details of the synthesis and powder XRD pattern in Fig. S1†).

Synthesis of Fe(CF3COO)2(CF3COOH)2 and Mn2(CF3COO)4(CF3COOH)4. 
The synthesis of Fe(CF3COO)2(CF3COOH)2 and Mn2(CF3COO)4(CF3COOH)4 is presented in the ESI.† The single crystals of these compounds, used later as FeF2 and MnF2 precursors, were grown after their synthesis directly from the solution in TFA. For this, the temperature of the solution was reduced to 60 °C for the Mn-compound and to 40 °C for the Fe-compound and maintained for 24 hours in order to grow crystals. To obtain single crystals of Co(CF3COO)2(H2O)4, the Co-compound was precipitated from the crude solution by adding toluene, isolated by filtration, dried, and then dissolved in toluene containing 2 vol% ethanol; all experiments were conducted in air. Out of this solution, crystals grew within 1 week in air.


Synthesis of FeF3. 
In a glovebox, the as-synthesized “Fe(TFA)3” precursor (∼1 g) was added to a quartz crucible and placed into a silica quartz tube that is fused on one side and open on the other. The open end was then sealed with a valve and transferred into a tube furnace. The valve was used to release the gaseous decomposition products; the outlet was separated from the air with an oil bubbler. First, the tube was held at 100 °C for 2 hours, and then heated at a rate of 50 °C h−1 to 275 °C, at which point the temperature was maintained for another 24 hours, yielding 215 mg of light grey FeF3.


Synthesis of FeF2, MnF2 and CoF2. 
Following the experimental procedure outlined above for FeF3, FeF2 was also obtained by thermal decomposition of Fe(CF3COO)2(CF3COOH)2 (285 °C, 24 h), MnF2 from Mn2(μ-CF3COO)4(CF3COOH)4 (350 °C, 3 h), and CoF2 from “Co(TFA)2” or Co(CF3COO)2(H2O)4 (295 °C, 20 h).

Electrochemical measurements
The cathodes consisted of FeF3, combined with conductive additives of carbon black (CB) and graphene oxide (GO). These three components were initially dry-mixed in a planetary ball mill (Fritsch, Pulverisette 7) in a ZrO2 beaker with ZrO2 balls for 2 h at 300 rpm. Subsequently, polyvinylidene fluorine (pVdF) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were added as a binder and as a solvent, respectively, to the combined mixture followed by an additional ball milling step for 2 h at 500 rpm to form a slurry. The weight fractions of all solid components were adjusted to 50% FeF3, 25% CB, 15% GO and 10% pVdF. The mass of the added NMP was 9-fold higher than the total mass of solid components. This slurry was then applied by brushing it onto carbon-coated aluminium foil. The painted current collectors were pre-dried in air at RT for 6 h and then dried under vacuum at 80 °C for at least 24 h. The final loading of FeF3 was ca. 0.5 mg cm−2. GO was prepared using the Brodie method42 and freeze-dried with liquid nitrogen under vacuum prior to use in batteries.
In an Ar-filled glovebox, this cathode was incorporated into an air-tight coin-type half-cell. Elemental Li or Na foil was used as a counter electrode and simultaneously acted as the reference electrode. The ion-conducting electrolyte used for the lithium half-cell was 1 M LiPF6 in a mixture of dimethyl carbonate (DMC):ethylene carbonate (EC) (1:1) with 3 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). For sodium half-cells, 1 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC) with 10 wt% FEC was used. Glass microfiber (Whatman) was installed as a separator. The same procedure was used with the transition metal difluorides, FeF2, CoF2 and MnF2, as active cathode materials. With FeF3 as a cathode material, all electrochemical measurements were performed in a voltage range between 2.0 V and 4.2 V. To electrochemically reduce GO, two cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) were performed on every cell with a scanning speed of 0.1 mV s−1. The subsequent galvanostatic cycling tests were performed with current rates between 0.1 A g−1 and 20 A g−1 based on the weight of FeF3. The measurements were done on a multi-channel potentiostat/galvanostat from Bio-Logic (MPG2).
Linear-sweep voltammetric measurements, used here to determine the oxidation state of Fe in “Fe(TFA)3”, were performed with a solution of 80 mg “Fe(TFA)3” in 10 mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) using 0.1 M LiPF6 as an electrolyte with an Autolab PGSTAT128N (Metrohm) potentiostat. A three-electrode set-up was used with a Pt disc as the working electrode and with glassy carbon as the counter electrode. The potential was measured with respect to a Ag/AgCl reference electrode (0.1 M NBu4Cl in acetonitrile) which has an offset of 0.45 V versus a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on a multi-channel potentiostat/galvanostat (VMP3, from Bio-Logic). The EIS spectra were recorded in the frequency range between 100 kHz and 100 mHz (84 points) with a perturbation amplitude of 5 mV. To fit the collected spectra, the EC-Lab software was used for the analysis of collected spectra. Half-cells were prepared and pre-cycled identically to the galvanostatic measurements.
Material characterisation

Powder and single crystal XRD. 
Powder diffraction patterns were obtained on a Stoe STADI P powder X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα1 radiation, λ = 1.540598 Å, germanium monochromator). Hygroscopic precursor powders were measured using a capillary (0.7 mm, Hilgenberg). The transition metal fluoride powders were measured on a transmission sample holder. For single-crystal measurements, a suitable crystal was selected and tip-mounted on a Bruker SMART platform with an Apex I-detector diffractometer at 100 K. Using Olex2,43 the structure was solved with either the ShelXD44 structure solution program using Dual Space or with the Superflip45–47 structure solution program using charge flipping and refined with the ShelXL48 refinement package using least squares minimization. The single crystals of the Mn- and Fe-precursors were measured at 100 K and 150 K, respectively. Crystallographic details and crystal structures are summarized in Fig. S2–S5 and Tables S1–S28.† Additionally, a complete list of all unit cell parameters is shown in Table S29.† CCDC entries – 1508835 for Mn2(CF3COO)4(CF3COOH)4, 1508836 for Co(CF3COO)2(H2O)4, 1508837 for Fe(CF3COO)2(CF3COOH)2, and 1508838 for Fe3O(CF3COO)7(CF3COOH) contain the supplementary, detailed crystallographic data for this paper.†


HRTEM and SEM. 
Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were taken with a CM30 (Philips) microscope, operated at 300 kV. High-resolution TEM images were obtained with a JEOL JEM-2200FS microscope operating at 200 kV. Samples for TEM analysis were prepared on carbon-coated Cu grids (Ted-Pella). The scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements were performed on a nanoSEM 230 (FEI).


TGS-MS. 
Thermogravimetric analysis/mass spectrometry was performed on a NETZSCH, STA 409 C/CD under vacuum with a heating rate of 1 K min−1 up to 500 °C.


Elemental analysis. 
The fluorine weight content was measured with an ion selective electrode after sample digestion with potassium within a closed nickel vessel. The iron content was measured with atomic absorption spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer 1100B) after digestion with sulfuric- and nitric acids.

Results and discussion
General considerations
The synthesis of several metal fluorides by the thermal decomposition of metal trifluoroacetates [M(TFA)n; for Cr(III), Fe(II/III), Co(II), Mn(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II)] as single-source precursors at 200–300 °C was briefly mentioned in 1968 by M. J. Baillie et al.49 In that work, however, no structural identification was provided for any of these metal–TFA compounds. Red color was indicated for the iron compound, different from our work presented herein (white product) and suggestive of the occurrence of partial hydrolysis.50 We have chosen to revisit this chemistry, which presents a highly attractive approach for obtaining transition metal fluorides due to its simplicity and potential to generate nanoscopic powders.
We were further inspired by more recent studies on the preparation of rare-earth metal fluorides (e.g., GdF3 and β-NaYF4)51–53 and transition metal fluorides (NaMF3, M = Mn, Co, Ni and Mg),54 and by our own synthesis of BiF3 from Bi(TFA)3.55
Synthesis of FeF3
For trivalent iron, we find that the major challenge is to prevent its conversion to iron-oxo-species. This can be avoided, for example, by the exclusion of moisture during the precursor synthesis and in its subsequent handling. Scheme 1a outlines a solventless synthesis of FeF3 using iron trifluoroacetate as a single-source precursor and TFA as both a solvent and a reagent. Trifluoroacetic anhydride was added during the synthesis to avoid the formation and accumulation of water and to scavenge any traces of it from TFA. The synthesis of the iron(III) trifluoroacetate precursor proceeds via the direct reaction between TFA and FeCl3 with the concomitant evolution of gaseous HCl. The reaction yields a white powder (Fig. 1a) that is highly hygroscopic. Even brief exposure of this white powder to air or moist solvents leads to a color change from white to red-brown indicating the presence of iron-oxo species, such as Fe3O(CF3COO)7(CF3COOH) which are discussed below. Although the as-obtained precursor appears crystalline in powder XRD patterns (Fig. 1b), we were unable to grow single crystals of suitable size for structural determination. It is poorly soluble in both TFA and its anhydride. Attempts to dissolve and recrystallize this precursor in several other solvents (ethanol, acetone, and tetrahydrofuran) were also unsuccessful and led to decomposition. While dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) dissolves this compound without decomposition, recrystallization fails because of the formation of an oily residue, probably caused by the strong solvation of iron ions by DMSO. Linear-sweep voltammetry measurements on such DMSO solutions confirm the sole presence of Fe3+ (Fig. S6†). The white color of the “Fe(TFA)3” is also strong evidence for Fe3+ in an octahedral environment. The d–d electron transitions in high-spin 3d5 compounds are spin forbidden and therefore make the compound colorless. Additionally, elemental analysis provides a weight composition (Fe – 13.78% and F – 42.11%) that is close to the ratio expected for iron(III) trifluoroacetate. The measured hydrogen content indicates a surplus of 0.28%. This hydrogen could arise from the incorporation of molecular TFA. Since both the trivalent state and stoichiometry of this compound are confirmed, but the crystal structure remains unknown, here and in the following we label this compound as “Fe(TFA)3”.
 Scheme 1  (a) Synthetic scheme presenting the reaction conditions and reactants for obtaining FeF3 and FeF2, as well as CoF2 and MnF2. (b) The ReO3-like structure of FeF3 has multiple pathways for Li-ion insertion as indicated by orange arrows. (c) The rutile structure of FeF2, and other transition metal difluorides, is easily accessible for Li-ion insertion via the channels along the [001] direction. 
The thermal decomposition of the TFA anion presumably proceeds via decarboxylation, formation of the trifluoromethyl anion (CF3−) and its subsequent dissociation into a fluoride ion (F−) and difluoromethylene (CF2).56 F− is then combined with a metal ion to form the corresponding metal fluoride. Hence, with three TFA anions per Fe3+ it is possible to obtain FeF3 upon decomposition. When TFA anhydride is not used in the synthesis, a large quantity of a dark red side product is obtained, whose crystal structure could be determined as Fe3O(CF3COO)7(CF3COOH), as illustrated in Fig. S2† (and detailed in Tables S1–S7†). This compound crystallizes in a monoclinic system with the space group P21/c (no. 14). The core of this structure is a trimer centered by an oxygen atom bound to every Fe(III) ion. Bridging trifluoroacetate anions and one TFA molecule ensures the 6-fold coordination of each iron atom. This M3O-motif has been already reported once for Fe3O(CF3COO)6,57 as well as for Mn,58 Co59 and Cr,60 all having mixed-valency within the M3O-unit. Such or similar iron-oxo complexes along with other products from the partial hydrolysis of “Fe(TFA)3” produce large amounts of FeF2 upon thermal decomposition if reacted with trace amounts of moisture. Assuming the decomposition path shown above, FeF2 is obtained because the iron-oxo and other related complexes no longer contain a sufficient number of trifluoroacetate groups to yield three fluoride ions per iron atom.
We also followed the step-wise heat-induced conversion of “Fe(TFA)3” to FeF3 by TGA-MS analysis (Fig. S7†). The release of charged species [F, CO2, CO, COF and CFx (x = 1–3)] is observed in each decomposition step. The mass losses are 5.72% at 200 °C, 15.44% at 250 °C and 14.42% at 270 °C. Fluorine is also released at 350 °C, possibly from decomposing fluorocarbon compounds.
The obtained light grey powder of FeF3 contains no more than 2% of FeF2 as an impurity. A powder XRD pattern can be indexed with a hexagonal unit cell of a ReO3-type structure (Scheme 1b).61,62 The width of the reflections is suggestive of the small grain size. The SEM images show thin, leaf-like particles (flakes). TEM provides that each “leaf” is composed of crystallites of around 5–20 nm, consistent with the Scherrer analysis of the powder XRD pattern (12 nm). This small size is obtained for decompositions at 275 °C, while higher reaction temperatures yield larger crystals of 40–50 nm. The crystalline parts are randomly oriented and surrounded by thinner amorphous parts (Fig. 1d and e). Such a structure offers an ample amount of grain boundaries and edges for faster ionic and electronic insertion and diffusion. In addition, structural disorder and defects might be helpful as well. Additionally, the low-magnification SEM and TEM images of FeF3 can be seen in Fig. S8.†
Synthesis of MF2
The crystal structures of the precursor compounds Fe(CF3COO)2(CF3COOH)2, Mn2(CF3COO)4(CF3COOH)4 and Co(CF3COO)2(H2O)4 were determined by single-crystal XRD (Fig. 2a–c). Fe(CF3COO)2(CF3COOH)2 crystallizes in a monoclinic system with the space group C2/c (no. 15) and contains a bis-trifluoroacetate bridged Fe(II) dimer, again with an overall 6-fold coordination of iron ions (Fig. S3 and Tables S8–S15†). A similar molecular arrangement is found for Mn2(CF3COO)4(CF3COOH)4 but it crystallizes in a triclinic crystal structure with the space group P (no. 2) (Fig. S4 and Tables S16–S22†). For Co(CF3COO)2(H2O)4, the hydrated form of the Co precursor also crystallizes in a triclinic system with the space group P (no. 2). The structure contains a 6-fold coordinated Co(II) ion, with the trifluoroacetates trans to one another (Fig. S5 and Tables S23–S28†). The powder XRD patterns of these compounds agree with the calculations from the single-crystal data (Fig. 2d–f). The slight shift of the peak position is due to the temperature difference between the single crystal (100 K) and the powder measurements (RT). Some additional peaks within the powder pattern arise from hydrolysis products. All precursors are highly hygroscopic, but both the hydrated as well as the non-hydrated difluoride precursors yield phase-pure MF2 upon decomposition (Fig. 2). The obtained difluorides have particle sizes between 20–300 nm and they all crystallize in the rutile structure type (Scheme 1c, Fig. S9a–S11a†). CoF2 and FeF2 form rod-shaped crystallites. The observed nanoparticles may have grown in the molten precursor in a way that is similar to the formation of nanoparticles in a colloidal synthesis.

Li-ion storage in FeF3 cathodes
Because of the highly insulating nature of FeF3, an operational cathode could be constructed only through the use of nanocrystalline powders (synthesized in this work), efficiently blended with highly conductive carbon additives [carbon black and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)]. The layered nature of rGO is highly beneficial for optimizing electronic transport within the composite. Efficient mixing of these three components was achieved by ball-milling, wherein (unreduced) GO was used. The use of unreduced GO is better suited to dispersing this dry mixed blend into NMP for the formation of a slurry. Thus, the dry FeF3/GO/CB mixture was then combined with the pVdF polymer as a binder and NMP as a solvent, and subjected to one more step of ball-milling, followed by casting and drying. Importantly, FeF3 remained non-reduced throughout the course of these manipulations as evidenced by the XRD patterns of the obtained films (Fig. S12†).
For obtaining fully operational cathodes, unreduced GO must be converted into rGO. Normally, this can be accomplished by heat treatment, but this also leads to the undesired partial reduction of FeF3 to FeF2. We have thus adapted the electrochemical in situ reduction of GO as an alternative procedure, which is known and used in other fields.63 During the reductive sweep in CV, the reduction of GO is observed at around 2.3 V vs. Li+/Li (Fig. 3a). Subsequent CV cycles in Fig. 3a correspond to the one-electron cycling of FeF3. Even though the mechanism of Li+ intercalation into FeF3 was examined experimentally and theoretically,18,64–67 the details remain contradictory. Clearly, for a one-electron process, it is not a mere intercalation to form LiFeF3 as this compound has yet to be observed experimentally and attempts to synthesize it have been reported as unsuccessful.68–70 There is ample evidence that the initial ReO3-type structure transforms into a tri-rutile-like structure with a composition close to Li0.5FeF3. Further reduction either forms inclusions of Fe and LiF or, more likely, results in the formation of FeF2 and LiF (for an overall one-electron process).18,64–66 In accordance with CV measurements, two distinct reversible reactions are observed suggesting two prevailing intermediate states (Li0.25FeF3 at ca. 3.3 V and Li0.5FeF3 at ca. 3 V), based on studies by Doe et al.,64 Yamakawa et al.65 and Li et al.66 With regard to the 3-electron reduction of FeF3 to Fe and LiF, it is known that this process is reversible only at low currents and only for a limited number of cycles.17 This behavior was also observed for our nanocrystalline FeF3 when cycled to below 2 V (Fig. S13†).

Galvanostatic cycling vs. lithium was limited to one-electron reactions within the voltage window of 2–4.2 V. A constant current-constant voltage (CCCV) protocol, with constant voltage steps at 2 and 4.2 V, was applied to maximize the efficiency of charge insertion and extraction. The cells were tested at different current rates from the smallest at 0.1 A g−1 (CCCV until 50% of current) to the highest at 20 A g−1 (CCCV until 10% of current) over 100 cycles (Fig. 3b). Between the second and 100th cycle, 92% capacity retention was observed at a current density of 15 A g−1 with a high coulombic efficiency of at least 99.8%. The ability to be charged with higher power density compared to the bulk can be attributed to the leaf-like and nanocrystalline structure of our FeF3. Somewhat surprisingly, better retention of capacity upon cycling at higher rates suggests the existence of an important rate-dependent reaction that impacts the overall reversibility of Li-insertion and extraction. EIS measurements as a function of cycling time, performed on two half-cells cycled at 0.1 A g−1 and 1 A g−1, provide a possible insight (see ESI for results in Fig. S14 and S15, Table S30† and additional discussions). The most plausible explanation lies in the carrier-density-dependent thickness of the solid–electrolyte interface layer (denoted as the surface film, sf) on the cathode. The modelling of the EIS spectra suggests strong reduction in the resistance at the surface layer (Rsf) at high current densities, without overall deterioration of charge transport in other parts of the cell. Charge-transfer resistance (Rct) is moderately growing in both cells. The surface layer is formed right after the assembly of the battery and during the first discharge. Lowering of Rsf in cathodic materials at higher currents is usually attributed to its decreasing thickness.71–74 We assume that the higher thickness of the surface layer on a high-surface-area nanostructured electrode eventually leads to exclusion of some electrode regions from the reversible reaction. Besides the influence of the current density, the etching of FeF3 by the in situ formed HF in LiPF6-based electrolytes may play a central role in the long-term capacity retention.18,75 A voltage–capacity plot at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 (Fig. 3c) shows a pronounced voltage plateau starting at around 3.5 V and ending at 3 V, providing an average voltage of 3.1 V. At faster cycling rates (Fig. S16†), the average voltage drops slightly due to the less pronounced plateau at around 3.3 V and the increased CCCV capacity at 2 V. The highest capacity of approximately 220 mA h g−1 was obtained with a current of 0.1 A g−1. A rather high rate capability is illustrated in Fig. 3d.
Na-ion batteries with the FeF3 cathode
The nanocrystalline FeF3 was also tested in sodium half-cells, exhibiting high rate-capability and capacities of up to 150–160 mA h g−1 (Fig. 4). Contrary to Li-ion cells, no pronounced peaks were observed in the CV (not shown) except for the reduction of GO at 2.3 V. Additionally, the voltage–capacity plot (Fig. 4a) does not show any distinct plateaus, which are normally observed in amorphous materials.76 The mechanism behind the electrochemical intercalation of Na into FeF3 still remains poorly covered in the literature. We assume a similar mechanism to that for the related compound FeF3·0.33H2O.14 The high rate capability can be demonstrated with step wise measurements at different charge rates (Fig. 4b). The galvanostatic measurements were performed between 1.6 V and 4.0 V, with the average working voltage amounting to 2.8 V. The initial capacity was measured to be 160 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 0.2 A g−1 (Fig. 4c) — comparable to those of state-of-the-art Na-ion cathodes.4,77 The best cycling retention obtained after 100 cycles was determined to be 90% at a rather high rate of 5 A g−1.

Electrochemical performance of metal difluorides
For these compounds, a conversion reaction takes place: MF2 + 2Li(Na)+ + 2e− = M0 + 2LiF(NaF), where M = Fe, Co or Mn.78 This is evidenced by numerous studies using in situ79 and ex situ80–83 methods. Only a half of the formed LiF takes part in the reversible reaction in the case of CoF2 and MnF2. FeF2 is generally fully reversible, but it still shows fast capacity fading. Ab initio calculations indicate a bandgap of 3.14 eV for FeF2,84 lower than that for MnF2 (3.62 eV)85 and CoF2 (4.44 eV),86 suggesting higher electronic conductivity as a contributing factor to better electrochemical behavior. Electrochemical measurements indicated that the difluorides exhibit higher capacities when obtained from non-hydrated precursors (Fig. S9–S11†). The electrochemical performance of FeF2, CoF2 and MnF2 was measured in a voltage window between 1.5–4.2 V vs. Li+/Li and 1.2–4.0 V vs. Na+/Na with a current density of 100 mA g−1 at RT. For FeF2 (Fig. S9†), an initial capacity of 470 mA h g−1 was obtained although this quickly faded in subsequent cycles. In the CV, it is visible that the conversion reaction does not reach completion at 1.5 V. In Na-ion cells, FeF2 demonstrated improved cycling retention, but with a much lower initial capacity of 120 mA h g−1. In the case of MnF2 (Fig. S10†), both Li- and Na-cells showed rather low capacities of about 100 mA h g−1. On the contrary, Li-ion cells with CoF2 (Fig. S11†) exhibited an initial capacity of 280 mA h g−1, with 25% capacity retention after 50 cycles. For the analogous Na-ion cells prepared with CoF2, a charge storage capacity of only 100 mA h g−1 could be obtained. Finally, these results clearly indicate an important message that these conversion reactions with Na-ions are possible for the metal fluorides investigated.
Conclusions
In this report, a simple synthetic route to FeF3 and several transition metal difluorides (FeF2, CoF2, MnF2) is presented. The corresponding precursors, metal trifluoroacetates, can be conveniently synthesized from their respective metal chlorides and trifluoroacetic acid. Iron(III) trifluoroacetate, to the best of our knowledge, is for the first time, here, reported in detail. We have also determined the crystal structures of four new compounds, each being an efficient precursor towards its respective metal fluoride.
Since no organic solvents, other than TFA, are involved in either the synthesis, decomposition or isolation of the products, and because unreacted, distilled-out TFA can be re-used, the overall cost of the produced FeF3 is very low. We estimate the price of FeF3 to be 34.5$ kg−1 using prices (from Sinochem Qingdao Co.) for technical purity reagents (1$ kg−1 for FeCl3 and 8.1$ kg−1 for TFA). TFA anhydride is not taken into account as it might not be required in an industrial setting where moisture removal/dryness can be accomplished by other means. The electrochemical storage of Li- and Na-ions in these metal fluorides has also been assessed. With FeF3, high capacities of up to 220 mA h g−1 and good reversibility were attained at a moderate current density of 100 mA g−1 (∼0.5 C).
As a sodium cathode, FeF3 exhibits capacities at a current rate of 200 mA h g−1. High rate-capabilities, which may in practice translate into high power densities, were observed in both Li- and Na-ion cells. In particular, the cells remained fully reversible at high current densities of up to 20 A g−1. Future work shall focus on extending this simple synthetic methodology to more complex metal fluorides, such as those of the generic formula AMF3 (A = Na and Li; M = Fe, Co, Ni, and Mn). From the perspective of alkali-metal batteries, these compounds would have the advantage of being lithiated/sodiated from the beginning, thus granting compatibility with both Li- and Na-free anode materials such as graphite.
