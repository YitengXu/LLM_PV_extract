Monolithic CdCO3 micron sized crystals synthesized in the first step were decomposed by calcination to evolve CO2 to form porous CdO crystals, having a similar outer shape but with a tailored internal nanostructure. Controlled Se2− ion exchange with CdO crystals yielded CdO–CdSe architectures with tunable composition and optoelectronic properties. Pearson's acid–base concept is used as a guiding principle for controlling the morphology and composition of the formed architectures. The photoelectrochemical properties of the system comprising CdO–CdSe architectures were investigated at various stages of ion exchange intervals. CdO–CdSe architectures on indium tin oxide (ITO) is a promising photoelectrode with excellent photovoltaic properties exhibiting a short-circuit current density of 7.36 mA cm−2 under 1 Sun illumination.1 IntroductionIon exchange in ionic semiconductors represents a straightforward, effective and convenient way to synthesize metal oxides and chalcogenide semiconductors with desired morphologies, sizes and electronic properties.1 In a conventional synthesis of nanomaterials, experimental factors always entangle, making it difficult to control the above-mentioned factors. Ion exchange in bulk semiconductors can require high activation energy, as diffusion of ions in and out of the bulk of the semiconductor is not easy. Thus, only surface reaction is possible and transformation may not be complete. In the case of porous nanomaterials, due to a very high surface to volume ratio, the exchange reactions can take place with much less activation energy and complete exchange is possible.2 Methods such as imprinting, templating and moulding are able to form nanostructures with desired morphologies, but they are of limited use because the available number of geometries and sizes is less.3 The solution-based ion exchange reaction can be used to fabricate such materials, which provide a facile, cost-effective method to prepare high-quality functional nanomaterials. Furthermore, an ion exchange reaction can circumvent the difficulties of high-temperature doping and deposition of nanomaterials, which can provide better reproducibility and much lower fabrication costs.Various workers have reported the fabrication of metal oxide and/or chalcogenide nanostructures by ion exchange.4 For example, Alivisatos et al. showed that complete and reversible ion exchange of CdX (X = S, Se, Te) to Ag2X is possible.2 Konenkamp et al. showed that a variety of metal sulfides can be obtained from ZnO nanorods by anion and cation exchange reactions.5 Ogale et al. reported shape preserving transformation of ZnO structures to TiO2.6 While there is plenty of work carried out on the synthesis of nanostructures by ion exchange, reports on using these materials in electronic devices are rare. Some of the classic examples of the use of ion exchange reactions to construct high performance electronic devices include partial conversion of CdS to Cu2S to form heterojunction solar cells and the fabrication of arrays of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xSe nanocables for photoelectrochemical cells.7,8Herein we report, for the first time, on the fabrication of CdO–CdSe nanoporous architectures by ion exchange from CdO, directly on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates by a facile low temperature solution chemistry approach. The first step involves the fabrication of nanoporous CdO crystals by thermal decomposition of monolithic CdCO3 crystals, formed by a solution growth technique. The second step involves controlled formation of a CdSe shell around CdO nanoporous domains by anion exchange with Se2− ion solution. These architectures exhibited excellent photoelectrochemical properties. The properties of these structures can be tuned simply by controlling the ion exchange time.2 Experimental2.1 Synthesis of CdCO3 and CdOAll the chemicals used in this experiment were of analytical grade and were obtained from Sigma Aldrich, Korea. In a typical synthesis of CdCO3 crystals, 0.3M Cd(NO3)2 and 0.6 M urea solution were prepared in triply distilled water. 25 mL of each solution was mixed together in a 50 mL capacity falcon tube. The two ITO substrates were kept inside with conducting sides facing the wall of the tubes. The tubes were then suspended in a water bath maintained at 80 °C for 6 hours. After completion of the reaction the tubes were taken out and the films covered with shiny white crystals with sharp edges were washed with distilled water and dried with a stream of argon. To prepare CdO nanoporous crystals, the obtained CdCO3 crystal films were calcined at 400 °C for 30 min in a muffle furnace in ambient air. The temperature for calcination was determined from thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). After calcination, a dark brown colored film of CdO was obtained.2.2 Synthesis of CdO–CdSe nanoporous architecturesCdO–CdSe architectures were then prepared by Se2− ion exchange reaction. The film with CdO nanoporous crystals was suspended in 0.1 M sodium selenosulfate solution, which was prepared as described elsewhere,18 in water at 60 °C for desired time durations, where O2− from CdO gets replaced with Se2− to form a CdSe shell of desired thickness over a CdO layer. After completion of the ion exchange reaction, the films were washed with deionised water, dried in an oven at 90 °C for 30 min and stored in the dark for further characterizations.2.3 CharacterizationsThe crystal structure and the phase of the architectures were determined using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/MAX 2500 V, Cu Kα, λ = 0.15418 nm). The morphology of the crystals was determined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4200). UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a spectrophotometer (CARY 100 conc-EL04073168) with another identical reference ITO substrate. Thermo-gravimetric analysis of CdCO3 crystals was carried out with a TGA (Bruker TG-DTA 2000SA) in a nitrogen atmosphere at a rate of 10 °C min−1. Moreover, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and the pore volume were measured by the nitrogen gas adsorption–desorption method at 77 K using a Belsorp II, BET, Japan Inc.In order to measure the solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency, CdO–CdSe architectures on ITO were incorporated into thin layer sandwich-type cells with Pt-coated FTO as the counter electrode (obtained by sputtering), using a spacer film (50 μm thick polyester film) and an electrolyte 0.1M polysulfide. Cell performance was measured by irradiation with 100 mW cm−2 white light (1 Sun) with Air Mass (AM) 0 and 1.5 filters as a solar simulator in the presence of a water filter (450 W xenon lamp, Oriel Instruments). Current was measured by using a Keithley 2400 source meter. Impedance spectra were measured with an IVIUM Compactstat impedance analyser under open circuit conditions. The frequency range was 0.1 to 106 Hz with a sinusoidal amplitude of 50 mV. Impedance parameters were obtained by fitting the obtained curves using Z-view software.3 Results and discussionCadmium carbonate (CdCO3) monolithic crystals can be synthesized in high yield, at low temperature, using urea as the source of CO32− ions.9 The reactions leading to the formation of the crystals can be given as below. NH2CONH2 + H2O → 2NH3 + CO2(1) NH3 + H2O → NH4+ + OH−(2) CO2 + 2OH− → CO32− + H2O(3) Cd2+ + CO32− → CdCO3(4) NH4+ + NO3− → NH4(NO3)(5)Firstly, at high temperature, urea hydrolyses to give ammonia and carbon dioxide (1). In the basic medium, carbon dioxide forms carbonate ions according to eqn (3). Carbonate ions then react with cadmium ions present in the solution to form CdCO3 crystals as given in eqn (4). Fig. 1a and b show the SEM images of the CdCO3 crystals on the ITO surface, formed by the reaction of 0.3 M cadmium nitrate and 0.6 M urea. As is evident from the image, flat surfaced, sharp-edged crystals are formed. The SEM image of the single CdCO3 crystal (Fig. 1b) shows that a well defined, high quality, micron-sized crystal is formed. The formation of CdCO3 was confirmed by XRD analysis (Fig. 2). The XRD pattern matches well with JCPDS card no. 08-0456, corresponding to mineral Otavite. The important factors controlling the morphology of the formed product are; slow release of CO32− ions in the solution by decomposition of urea and coordinating ability of NO3− ions with Cd2+ ions, which controls the local concentration of the latter in the solution, available for reaction. To verify this hypothesis, we synthesized cadmium carbonate crystals using other cadmium ion precursors such as cadmium acetate and cadmium sulfate. Fig. S2(a–d)† show the SEM images of cadmium carbonate crystals synthesized using different precursors. The coordinating ability of different ligands to Cd2+ can be explained on the basis of Pearson's acid–base concept. Cd2+ is a weak acid, whereas the basicity order of ligands used in this experiment is CH3COO− > NO3− > SO4−. Thus, it is clear that Cd2+ will bind more preferentially to SO4− ions and thus it will offer less local concentration of Cd2+ ions available for the reaction. Cuboid crystals are formed only when cadmium nitrate is used as the Cd2+ ion source. Thus the shape of the architectures can be controlled, merely by changing the precursors, thereby obviating the need for any surfactants or complexing agents for shape control. However, Pearson's concept cannot predict the morphology of the formed product and only comparison can be made on the basis of local concentration of Cd2+ ions. Another important factor affecting the morphology of the products is the solubility product (Ksp) of the precursors, which again can control the local concentration of the Cd2+ ions available for reaction. X-ray diffraction patterns of the crystals formed with different precursors are shown in Fig. S3.† All the diffraction patterns are almost the same and match with JCPDS card no. 08-0456 of the CdCO3 cubic structure. In the next step, porous CdO architectures were obtained by thermal decomposition of CdCO3 crystals. The decomposition temperature was determined from TGA (Fig. S1†). The TGA shows that the weight essentially remained constant until 310 °C, after which it dropped rapidly. The loss in weight was around 25.60%, which correlates well with the theoretical value of 25.53%, calculated from the following equation. CdCO3 → CdO + CO2↑(6) Fig. 1  (a) Low magnification SEM image of the CdCO3 crystals, (b) SEM image of the single CdCO3 crystal, (c) SEM image of the CdO crystal obtained after thermal decomposition of CdCO3 crystals, and (d) SEM image of the single CdO crystal.  Fig. 2  X-ray diffraction patterns of CdCO3 and CdO crystals. Thus, it can be concluded that CdO crystals are formed by the evolution of CO2 from the lattice of CdCO3. Due to evolution of CO2, porous CdO crystals were formed, as is evident from the SEM images shown in Fig. 1c and d, with a similar outer shape but with a tailored internal nanostructure and with well defined porosity throughout the bulk of the crystals. The formation of CdO was confirmed from the XRD pattern (Fig. 2), which matches well with JCPDS card no. 73-2245, corresponding to the cubic phase of CdO. Different shapes of CdO crystals can be obtained by decomposing different shaped CdCO3 crystals (Fig. S2b and d†). The XRD patterns of CdO crystals with different shapes are shown in Fig. S3b.† The patterns are similar and correspond to the cubic structure of CdO. We have characterized CdO architectures with BET surface area analysis and the results are provided in the ESI.† In the pore size distribution curve (Fig. S8†), we found that the pore size distribution is uneven, and the pore sizes are mainly distributed around the sizes of 3, 12 and 22 nm. These types of well defined, porous, interconnected architectures can be beneficial for various applications including photoelectrochemical cells, supercapacitors, gas sensors, catalyst support in fuel cells and so on where high porosity coupled with interconnectivity and conductivity is prerequisite.Bonding between atoms of inorganic compounds containing two or more different elements is considered as partially ionic and partially covalent. The bonding in inorganic compound semiconductors is considered to be more ionic in nature.10 This character permits exchange of the constituent elements in ionic form with another one in ionic form. We then prepared CdO–CdSe architectures by controlled ion exchange of O2− from CdO with a Se2− ion. According to Pearson's acid–base concept, soft acids tend to bind to soft bases and hard acids prefer to bind to hard bases. In the present case, Cd2+ is a soft acid, O2− is a hard base and Se2− is a soft base. Thus it is clear that Cd2+ will tend to bind more preferentially to Se2− and thus CdO–CdSe transformation will be thermodynamically favourable. Also the solubility product of CdSe (Ksp = 1 × 10−33) is much less than that of CdO (Ksp = 5.4 × 10−5), which could favour the formation of stable CdSe.11 This was the case with our CdO architectures; when we put the CdO architecture in a selenosulfate solution, Se2− ions exchanged slowly with O2− ions forming CdSe. The rate of this transformation was found to be dependent on the concentration of Se2− ions and solution temperature. The chemical reaction for transformation can be given as: CdO + Se2− → CdO–CdSe + O2−(7)To study the ion exchange reactions, we have grown CdO crystals on ITO with low population by using low concentration of the precursors. Fig. 3 shows the scanning electron microscopic images of single crystals of CdO to CdSe transformation at different ion exchange time intervals. As is clear from the images, while exchanging the Se2− ion, the outer shape of the architectures almost remained similar, while, the pores seem to be closing. Also the edges of the architectures become smoother. Formation of CdSe can be monitored from XRD data (Fig. 4). As the ion exchange proceeds, the peaks corresponding to CdO start to vanish and new peaks corresponding to the cubic phase of CdSe (JCPDS data no. 08-0459) start appearing. A rough estimation of the rate of ion exchange reaction can be made from the graph (Fig. S4†), where we have plotted the intensity of the CdSe 〈111〉 peak against the ion exchange time. Initially the rate of formation of CdSe was very fast, as the large surface area of architectures was available for the ion exchange reaction. As the exchange time was increased, due to closing of the pores, the diffusion of the Se2− ions might have been hampered, resulting in slowing down the reaction. After 12 hours of reaction, most of the CdO was converted to CdSe, leaving behind some traces of CdO, probably at the centre of the crystals. The closing of the pores might have happened due to detachment of some of the formed CdSe from the surface of architectures. The ion exchange reaction can also be monitored using UV-vis absorption spectra, due to the difference in the absorption spectra of CdO and CdSe. The bulk band-gap of CdO is ∼2.1 eV, while that of CdSe is ∼1.7 eV.12Fig. 5a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the CdO–CdSe system recorded at different ion exchange time intervals. As the ion exchange time increases, the absorption band (λ = 730 nm) corresponding to CdSe starts to appear and the absorption becomes stronger as the ion exchange time goes on increasing, indicating the increase in the amount of CdSe in the CdO–CdSe system. We further tried to quantitatively detect the amount of Cd, O and Se in the system with EDX analysis (Fig. S5†), however, the EDX spectra only showed the presence of Cd and Se in the samples with an ion exchange time of 30 min and longer. This may be due to full surface coverage of architectures by CdSe. There is a slight excess of Se in the architectures, which may be due to the formation of a thin layer of elemental selenium on the crystal surface, as the selenosulfate solution used for ion exchange slowly decomposes to form elemental selenium. We also tried to exchange Se2− ion with original CdCO3 architectures. Fig. S6† shows the SEM images of the architectures after 1 h of ion exchange reaction. As can be seen from the images, the original structure gets completely disturbed after exchange reaction forming CdSe particles. This can be explained from the fact that CO3− is a much bigger sized anion compared to Se2− and thus replacing it might have caused the structure to collapse. We further investigated the photoelectrochemical properties of the ITO–CdO–CdSe system in a polysulfide electrolyte using Pt as the counter electrode. The thickness of the CdO–CdSe architecture films used for photoelectrochemical measurements was around 4.2 μm (Fig. S7†). The current–voltage characteristics of the devices are shown in Fig. 5b. The parameters obtained from the curves are summarized in Table 1. It is clear from the figure that CdO–CdSe architectures are photoactive and generate appreciable photocurrent upon illumination. The mechanism of charge generation and transfer can be given as:CdSe + hν → CdSe (h + e)CdSe (h + e) + CdO → CdO (e) + CdSe (h) Fig. 3  (a–e) SEM images of CdO–CdSe crystals with different ion exchange times and (f–j) high magnification SEM images of the surface of the corresponding crystals.

The maximum photovoltaic performance was obtained in the system where the ion exchange time was 30 min. This indicates that optimum amounts of CdO and CdSe are needed for obtaining the maximum photoconversion yield. Further increasing the ion exchange time improves the light harvesting, as is evident from UV-vis spectra, due to the increased CdSe amount, but in contrast, photovoltaic parameters decrease. There may be three reasons for this: (1) as CdO is highly conductive with a high bulk electron mobility of 531 cm2 V−1 S−1, it can rapidly carry the photogenerated electrons towards ITO with much less chance of recombination; but when CdSe is present in excess amount, the connection between neighbouring CdO particles (electrically accessible conduits) is lost and this may cause excessive recombination. (2) As the pores of architectures start to get close as the ion exchange time proceeds, the electrolyte may not enter throughout the bulk of the crystal and thus it cannot regenerate the oxidized CdSe, which results in recombination within the CdSe layer. (3) There is an interplay between light absorption (relative amounts of CdO and CdSe) and porosity of the architectures (diffusion of the electrolyte). As the light absorption increases (due to increased amount of CdSe), there is a decrease in porosity of the architectures. Thus, the sample with high light absorption (12 h) has less porosity and shows a low photoconversion yield. These two factors may have been balanced in a 30 min ion-exchanged system, which shows the maximum photocurrent density (Jsc), open circuit potential (Voc) and solar to electric power conversion efficiency (η). These assumptions are further supported by the impedance spectroscopy measurements (Fig. 6). Fig. 6  (a) Electrochemical impedance spectra of the ITO–CdO–CdSe–polysulfide–Pt system measured under 1 Sun illumination under open circuit conditions. The frequency range was 0.1 to 106 Hz with a sinusoidal amplitude of 50 mV. (b) Zoomed in view of the high frequency part of the spectra in (a). Impedance spectra of photoelectrochemical cells exhibit two semicircles; one in the high frequency region corresponding to the charge transfer resistance between the electrolyte and the counter electrode and the other in the low frequency region corresponding to the charge transfer resistance of the photoanode–electrolyte system. The performance of the photoanode is mainly related to the size of this second semicircle, as the parameters affecting the first semicircle are almost constant during the measurement of each of the samples.12,13 In the present case, as is evident from Fig. 6, the size of the second semicircle (Rct value) is strongly dependent on the ion exchange time. For pristine CdO, the Rct value is very high (15290 Ω). This is expected, since CdO does not absorb much light to generate appreciable photocurrent and photovoltage. A similar kind of result was obtained in our previous study involving the ZnO–CdSe system.13 As the ion exchange time increases, the amount of CdSe increases and thereby the amount of photogenerated electrons increases. This results in appreciable photocurrent and photovoltage generation, which further results in reduction of Rct. As the ion exchange time further increased, the value of Rct decreased considerably (866 Ω for the 20 min ion-exchanged sample). The lowest value of Rct is obtained for the sample with an ion exchange time of 30 min (393 Ω), which is also the sample with the highest photovoltaic performance. Further increasing the ion exchange time increased the value of Rct, which indicates that the excess generated CdSe creates a barrier in the charge transport. We have further measured the stability of the photocurrent of the CdO–CdSe system, the details of which are given in the ESI (Fig. S10†).It is worthwhile to compare our system with the other charge transfer systems having CdSe as the absorber.14 Kamat et al. used ex situ synthesized CdSe quantum dots to sensitize fullerenes and carbon nanocups. The former system exhibited a Jsc of ∼0.2 mA cm−2 and the latter exhibited a Jsc of 0.4 mA cm−2.15 Photoelectrochemical cells constructed with CdSe nanotubes obtained by ion-exchange with Cd(OH)2 exhibited a Jsc of 3.52 mA cm−2 and a η of 0.57%.16 A photoelectrode comprising TiO2 nanotubes with CdSe quantum dots exhibited a Jsc of 6.2 mA cm−2 and a power conversion efficiency of 1.8%.17 Our recent results with the ZnO–CdSe photoanode exhibited a Jsc of 14.5 mA cm−2 and a η of 3.38%. The above data indicate that photoanodes utilizing TiO2 and ZnO as a charge transporting medium tend to exhibit a higher photoconversion yield as compared to other systems. However, the system reported here is relatively new, employing CdO as the charge transport medium and in situ generated CdSe as the absorber. The performance of our cells is mainly limited by a poor fill factor. Studying the factors limiting photovoltaic parameters in the CdO–CdSe system is the future direction of our studies. With the controlled ion exchange of CdO architectures, CdO–CdSe architectures with continuous band gap can be formed, which can be useful to construct rainbow solar cells. The ion exchange concept is further extended to synthesize porous ZnO architectures from CdO architectures (see Fig. S12†).4 ConclusionsWe demonstrated the ion exchange fabrication of CdO–CdSe architectures by an anion exchange method, from porous CdO architectures. The photoelectrochemical properties of these architectures were tuned simply by changing the ion exchange time. The architectures exhibited excellent photovoltaic properties. Pearson's acid–base concept can be used as a guiding principle for ion exchange reactions in semiconductors. The concept of anion and cation exchange reactions from pre-synthesized nanostructures has the ability to expand the scope and diversify inorganic semiconductor nanomaterial synthesis. Ion exchanged products can have significantly different but useful properties such as various shapes and controlled band-gaps, which are not easy to control with conventional synthesis methods. This simple solution based process is cost-effective and can be used for mass-production of semiconductor materials with desired morphology for use in various optoelectronic devices.AcknowledgementsThis study was financially supported by the “Development of Basic Technologies for High Powered Lithium Ion Capacitors” of the KIST institutional program (Contract no. 2E23964) and by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MEST) (no. 2009-0092807).Notes and referencesG.
