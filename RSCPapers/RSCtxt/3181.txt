    , Accepted 15th January 2019First published on 16th January 2019AbstractDielectric polymer capacitors, especially those capable of operating efficiently at relatively low operating voltages, are urgently needed to meet the growing demands for miniaturization and reliability in advanced electronics and electrical power systems in automobiles and aerospace. However, high-performance energy storage properties are normally obtained in dielectric capacitors under the application of high electric fields. Herein, a series of all-polymer sandwich-structured films comprised of acrylic rubber dielectric elastomers (DE) dispersed in ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) as the outer layer and poly(methyl methacrylate) as the middle layer have been fabricated. The maximum electrical displacement, energy density, and discharge efficiency of the sandwiched films have been improved significantly by optimizing the DE content. Notably, a high energy density of 11.8 J cm−3 along with a very high efficiency of 89% has been achieved in the sandwiched film with 30 wt% DE at an applied field of 300 MV m−1, which is the best overall property set ever achieved in the representative polymer dielectrics. Excellent power density and great stability of energy storage performance over the bending cycles have been demonstrated in the layered films. All these features offer new opportunities for designing a new class of hierarchically structured dielectric polymers with excellent energy storage capability that can be achieved at relatively low electric fields.
1. Introduction
High efficiency technologies for energy storage and conversion are in great demand in order to utilize the electricity generated from renewable sources, e.g. solar and wind energy.1,2 Compared to the currently available electrochemical devices such as Li-ion batteries and double-layer supercapacitors, dielectric polymer capacitors possess unique features including the highest power density, the best charge–discharge rate capability and a long lifespan for a variety of applications in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), high frequency inverters, and power grids.3,4 Nevertheless, the energy densities of the dielectric capacitors are at least one order of magnitude lower than those of their electrochemical counterparts (i.e. >20 J cm−3).5–9 For example, the energy density of biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) films, which are the best commercial polymer dielectrics used in power inverters of HEV, is merely about 2 J cm−3 even at an ultrahigh electric field of 640 MV m−1.10,11 Note that substantial energy densities of dielectric materials are obtained at high applied electric fields, i.e. ≥450–600 MV m−1, which is close to the breakdown strength of the polymers. However, the required high voltages unfortunately bring new challenges to the miniaturization and reliability of advanced electronics and electrical power systems.12–17
The energy density (Ue) of dielectric materials can be illustrated as , where E is the applied electric field and D is the electric displacement. Polymers possess an intrinsically small D due to the small dipole moments of the chemical bonds, hence limiting their Ue.23–26 Exceptionally, the ferroelectric polymers represented by poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its co- and ter-polymers have the polar C–F groups with strong dipole moments in their molecular chains and a relatively higher dielectric constant (K) of 10–12 and a larger D of 9–10 μC cm−2 than other nonpolar polymers, which could offer one order of magnitude increase in Ue (e.g. ∼10 J cm−3).27 However, compared with the benchmark BOPP with a high charge–discharge efficiency (η) of ∼98% at 300 MV m−1,11,28,29 ferroelectric polymers have much lower η values (i.e. <70%) at applied electric fields >300 MV m−1 which severely inhibit their potential application in dielectric capacitors.30–32 Besides Ue, η is another critical parameter for capacitor performance. A low value of η denotes the presence of large energy loss, indicating the generation of huge amounts of waste heat during continuous operations that could reduce the reliability and lifetime of dielectric capacitors.21,22
To achieve much improvement in the K and D of polymers, one popular approach is to add a high loading of conductor filler (i.e. >15 vol%) or inorganic ceramic nanofillers (i.e. >50 vol%) with high K ranging from hundreds to thousands.12–20,40 However, this method inevitably increases the conductive loss and deteriorates η even at low electric fields due to the filler agglomeration at high loadings, and consequently, hinders further enhancement in the dischargeable Ue.33 The method of surface-modification of fillers has been developed to mitigate the issue of chemical compatibility between the fillers and polymer matrix. However, there is still room for improvement in the dischargeable Ue and η.34 Although it has been shown that D and Ue have been effectively improved by aligning the active ceramic nanowires along the parallel electric field direction, the complex fabrication procedure becomes challenging for practical applications.35,36
More recently, the use of topologically structured layer-by-layer composites is emerging as a promising route to provide concurrent enhancements in the dischargeable Ue and η.37 In our previous study, all-polymer films with a sandwich architecture were developed by introducing a low-K poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) layer into the ferroelectric copolymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) P(VDF–HFP), which shows a much improved dischargeable Ue and η than the respective single-layer polymer blend films at high electric fields (i.e. 440 MV m−1).55 The highest charge–discharged efficiency η of 92% has been achieved in the trilayered film with 70 vol% PMMA at low electric fields (i.e. 300 MV m−1). However, there is room for improvement in the electric displacement (Dmax − Dr = 6.2 μC cm−2) and the discharged energy density (9.1 J cm−3) of the trilayered film with 70 vol% PMMA. Besides ferroelectric polymers, dielectric elastomers (DE) are a class of field responsive electroactive polymers, which undergo shape changes in response to electrical stimulation.38 Yu et al. reported that acrylic rubber DE can increase the D of the nanocomposites due to the large elastic deformation with increasing the electric field.39 In line with this idea, we report herein the development of the sandwich-structured all-polymer films to greatly improve the energy storage performance at low electric fields. Organic DE blended in the ferroelectric P(VDF–HFP) matrix are used as the outer layers to provide high maximum displacement, while PMMA functions as the central layer to offer low remnant displacement. The thickness of each layer in the sandwich-structured films can be tuned during preparation and the volume ratio of the central to outer layers is thus selected to be approximately 70:30 to maintain the high energy storage efficiency demonstrated previously, while the incorporation of DE with varied contents of 5–50 wt% are included into the ferroelectric polymer as the outer layer in order to achieve much improvement in the electric displacement and the discharged energy density simultaneously. Notably, an ultrahigh η of 89% and a high Ue of 11.8 J cm−3 at 300 MV m−1 have been simultaneously obtained in the optimized trilayered film with 30 wt% DE, which surpasses those of the representative dielectric polymer films. Furthermore, the film exhibits a superior power density of 0.47 MW cm−3 and a discharging rate of ∼9.2 μs, exceeding those of BOPP (i.e. 0.04 MW cm−3 and 14 μs). The layered films have also shown great stability of the energy storage performance as demonstrated in the consecutive bending tests over 20000 cycles.
2. Experimental
2.1. Fabrication of the trilayered all-polymer films
Compared to PVDF, P(VDF–HFP) shows lower dielectric loss and higher breakdown strength and is utilized as the polymer matrix of the trilayered structures. The trilayered structured films were fabricated by a layer-by-layer solution casting method. 1 g of P(VDF–HFP) (with 10 wt% HFP, number-average molecular weight of 530000, Arkema, France) powder and 2 g of polyacrylate dielectric elastomers (AR71, Zeon Co., Japan) were dissolved in 10 mL N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Letai Co., China) and stirred at a rate of 400 rpm overnight to form a homogeneous solution. 2 g of PMMA powder were also dissolved in DMF by stirring for 12 h at 30 °C. Subsequently, the solution of P(VDF–HFP)/DE was cast onto a clean glass plate (20 × 20 cm) using laboratory casting equipment (MSK-AFA-L800, Hefei Kejing Materials Technology Co., Ltd.) at a casting rate of 25 mm s−1 and dried in a vacuum at 80 °C for 1 h to form the outer layer. The PMMA solution was then cast on the outer layer at a casting rate of 25 mm s−1 and dried in a vacuum at 80 °C for 1 h as the central layer film. After that, the P(VDF–HFP)/DE solution was cast onto the PMMA layer as the outer layer. The trilayered structured films were dried at 60 °C for 10 h in a vacuum to completely remove the solvent residue. Finally, the films were further heated under vacuum at 200 °C for 5 min and then immediately quenched in ice water. The quenched films were dried at 60 °C overnight and then peeled off the glass substrates. The thickness of each layer in the trilayered structured films can be tuned by simply controlling the solution concentration and scraper height. The cross-sectional images of the layered films were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta 250FEG, FEI, Ltd.).
2.2. Characterization
For the electrical measurements, gold electrodes of a typical thickness of 100 nm and diameter of 2 mm were sputtered on both sides of the polymer films using an auto fine coater (JFC-1600, JEOL, Ltd. Japan). The DC electric resistivities of the films were collected using a high-voltage test system (PolyK Technologies, State College, PA, USA). The electric displacement–electric field (D–E) loops of the samples were measured using a ferroelectric polarization tester (Radiant Technologies, Inc. USA) with a limited current of 0.19 mA at room temperature and 10 Hz. The fast discharge test was performed using a PK-CPR1502 test system (PolyK Technologies, USA). A Trek 10/10B high voltage amplifier was used to charge the capacitor sample soaked in silicone dielectric fluid and the typical charging time was ∼1 s. Then the charged capacitor was discharged to a high voltage noninductive resistor through a high-speed metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor switch. The resistance of the load resistor (RL) was selected as 100 kΩ to match the capacitance of the sample and achieve a certain discharge RC time constant. A computer aided homemade bending test system was used for mechanical bending tests.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Preparation and morphology characterization
As schematically shown in Fig. 1a, the P(VDF–HFP)/DE blend films with different volume fractions of the PMMA central layer were prepared layer-by-layer through the facile solution casting method. The tri-layered films are freestanding and mechanically flexible, as seen in Fig. 1b. The sandwiched film configuration has been further evidenced by the high magnification cross-sectional images (Fig. 1c–e). The absence of noticeable pores and voids in the tight multiple interfaces is attributed to the chemical compatibility between the amorphous PMMA and semi-crystalline P(VDF–HFP) layers.39 The thicknesses of the component layers were further examined in the high magnification cross-sectional SEM images. The total thickness of all the samples is fixed at about 20 ± 2 μm, which is readily controlled by the height of the scraper. The volume ratio of the central to outer layers was approximately 70:30. The mass fraction of DE in the outer layers was varied from 10%, 30% to 50%.

3.2. Capacitive energy-storage capability
The typical electric displacement–electric field (D–E) loops of the ternary tri-layered architecture films are measured with a 10 Hz unipolar triangle signal as a function of the applied field (Fig. 2 and S1†). As corroborated in Fig. 3a, the maximum displacement Dmax is substantially enhanced with the increase of the DE content under an electric field of 300 MV m−1. On the other hand, the remnant displacement Drem of the ternary tri-layered architecture films is nearly invariant and remains at a favorably low level of <0.4 μC cm−2 at different electric fields (Fig. S2a†), except for the DE content of 50 wt%. This trend has been further demonstrated by DC electric resistivity measured at 50 MV m−1 (Fig. S2b†). It is found that all tri-layered polymer films have excellent insulating properties and possess a favorably high level of electric resistivity of about 8.13 × 1012 Ω m. The highest displacement value (Dmax − Drem) of 8 μC cm−2 has been achieved in the optimized DE mass fraction (i.e. 30%) at 300 MV m−1 (Fig. 3b and S2c†). When the fraction of DE further increases to 50 wt%, the displacement value of Dmax − Drem is decreased to 7.18 μC cm−2. It is known that a high enhanced displacement value of Dmax − Drem is critical in order to obtain a high energy density at a low electric field (i.e. 300 MV m−1).

The characteristic breakdown strength is another key factor to assess the energy storage capability of the ternary tri-layered architecture films. The breakdown strength results of ternary tri-layered architecture films are analyzed using the Weibull statistics as follows:37 P(E) = 1 − exp(−(E/Eb)β)(1)where P(E) is the cumulative probability of electric failure, E is the experimental breakdown strength, Eb is the characteristic breakdown strength at a cumulative failure probability of 63.2%, and β is the Weibull modulus associated with the linear regressive fit of the distribution. In the Weibull distribution, the values of the β parameter of all ternary tri-layered architecture films are higher than 16, indicating the uniform data distribution and a high degree of reliability. As can be seen in Fig. S2d,†Eb decreases with the increase of the fraction of DE, i.e., from ≈414 MV m−1 of 5 wt% film to ≈327 MV m−1 of 50 wt% film, owing to low Eb (≈31 MV m−1) of the acrylic rubber DE.43Eb of 30 wt% film is 386 MV m−1, confirming that the optimized fraction of DE is beneficial to maintain high Eb of the ternary tri-layered architecture films.
The energy storage performances of the ternary tri-layered architecture films are determined from the D–E loops via a modified Sawyer–Tower circuit as a function of the applied fields (Fig. 2). As plotted in Fig. S3,† significantly enhanced U has been observed, which is ascribed to the dramatical improvement of Dmax with increasing the DE content. For instance, U increases from 9.8 J cm−3 of 5 wt% DE to 14 J cm−3 of 50 wt% DE. The most striking feature shown in Fig. 3c and S4a† is that the ternary tri-layered architecture film with a DE content of 30 wt% exhibits the highest dischargeable Ue of 11.8 J cm−3. Concurrently, a high η of 89% is also delivered in the 30 wt% tri-layered film at 300 MV m−1, while the dischargeable Ue of 9.39 J cm−3 and η of 67% decrease when the fraction of DE further increases to 50 wt%, as shown in Fig. S4b.† Since η is decided by the ratio of dischargeable Uevs. U, the improvement in η of the sandwich-structured polymer film is a consequence of the reduction in energy loss (Ul = U − dischargeable Ue). For ferroelectric materials, the energy loss includes conductive loss and ferroelectric loss; whereas conductive loss is decided by the electrical conductivity and the ferroelectric loss arises from polarization hysteresis.41
To investigate in depth the impact of energy loss mechanisms on energy storage capability, the conductive loss is inferred from the D–E loops with the assumption that the measured displacement at zero field (DE=0) comes mainly from the leakage current. The relationship between the effective conductivity σeff and DE=0 can be derived by the following equations: (2)where T is the period of the applied electric field, T = 1/f = 1/10 = 0.1 in the current case. Emax is the applied electric field. The conductive loss can be determined from the calculated effective conductivity σeff, and the ferroelectric loss is subtracted from the total energy loss to give the conduction loss. In this investigation, the ferroelectric films contain an insignificant content of the polar phase.42Fig. 3d summarizes the conductive loss of the ternary tri-layered architecture films under varied electric fields. Clearly, the value of the conductive loss is more than twice than that of the ferroelectric loss (Fig. S5†), indicating that conductive loss plays a dominant role in the total dielectric loss of the ternary tri-layered architecture films. Obviously, the ternary tri-layered architecture films show a relatively low conductive loss of <1 J cm−3 until the DE content reaches 30 wt%, which yields a high discharged efficiency of 89% at 300 MV m−1. However, the ternary tri-layered film with 50 wt% DE shows a higher conductive loss of 3.2 J cm−3 and ferroelectric loss of 1.39 J cm−3, thus deteriorating its discharged efficiency to 67% and dischargeable energy density to 9.39 J cm−3. These results confirm that the optimized fraction of DE (30 wt%) is beneficial to maintain a high discharged efficiency and energy density of the ternary tri-layered films.
3.3. The influence of film configuration on energy-storage capability
In addition to the studies of the variation of the DE content, we investigate the influence of film configuration including the single-layered blends on the energy storage capabilities. The single-layered blend film with 30 wt% DE content was prepared by the solution casting method for comparison (Fig. S6†). Fig. 4a shows slimmer unipolar D–E loops of the ternary tri-layered film with respect to that of P(VDF–HFP). As shown in Fig. 4b, a greater Dmax − Drem of 8 μC cm−2 was achieved in the tri-layered configuration film at 300 MV m−1 when compared with the single layer films. As expected, improved discharged Ue has been achieved in the ternary tri-layered films than those of the single-layered blends and the constitute polymers, as plotted in Fig. 4c. For instance, at 300 MV m−1, the ternary tri-layered film exhibits the highest discharged Ue of 11.8 J cm−3 in comparison to 10 J cm−3 of the single-layer blends, 8.3 J cm−3 of P(VDF–HFP) and 5.9 J cm−3 of PMMA. The most striking feature presented in Fig. 4d is that the ternary tri-layered film simultaneously presents a high η of ≈89% even at an electric field of 300 MV m−1. By contrast, an unsatisfactory η of ≈65% is delivered in P(VDF–HFP), indicating that a much lower energy loss (i.e. 1 − η) can be attained in the tri-layered film than that of the pure ferroelectric polymer. Therefore, the designed multilayered structure has been identified to be one of the optimized structures that are beneficial to energy storage performances.

Fig. 5 compares the energy storage performance of the representative dielectric polymer thin films and polymer composites at 300 MV m−1. Apparently, it has been a challenge to simultaneously achieve high energy storage density and high efficiency in current dielectric materials. For example, for the materials with η ≥ 80%, the highest dischargeable Ue is around 8 J cm−3. While BOPP delivers the best η of ∼96%, its dischargeable Ue is only around 2 J cm−3.11 Notably, the ternary tri-layered film possesses one of the best overall energy storage performances with a dischargeable Ue of 11.8 J cm−3 and a η of 89%. Comparatively, P(VDF–HFP) and the ferroelectric poly(vinylidenefluoride-ter-trifluoroethylene-ter-chlorotrifluoroethylene) P(VDF–TrFE–CTFE) terpolymer have a discharged Ue of 8.3 J cm−3 and 7 J cm−3 at 300 MV m−1 with a η of 65% and 60%, respectively.43 Although the cross-linked P(VDF–CTFE) and the single-layered nanocomposite films display a high η of 88% and 80% at 300 MV m−1, the corresponding discharged Ue are merely 8 J cm−3 and 5 J cm−3, respectively.16,41 Compared to BOPP, an enormous enhancement of 88.3% on discharged Ue has been achieved in the trilayered film with a comparable η. As further evidenced in Table 1, which summarizes the energy storage properties and fabrication methods of recently reported polymer-based dielectric materials at low applied electric fields, the performance of the trilayered film is among the best that has been obtained so far at low electric fields.35,46–54

3.4. Fast-discharge capability and mechanical stability
Pulsed power applications require dielectric capacitors with a fast discharge rate and a high power density.44 A high-speed capacitor discharge circuit was designed to measure the discharge rate at an identical RC (resistor–capacitor) time constant, in which the samples are charged at 200 MV m−1 followed by discharging across a 100 kΩ resistor. The discharge time, τ0.9, is defined as the time to discharge 90% of the stored energy into the load. Interestingly, it was found that the discharge rate of the tri-layered film is faster than that of BOPP, i.e. 9.2 vs. 14 μs, as shown in Fig. 6a. The released energy density measured from the discharge experiments of the tri-layered film is more than 8 times larger than that of BOPP, i.e. 4.29 vs. 0.54 J cm−3 at 200 MV m−1, which is consistent with the measured results of D–E loops (Fig. S4a†). The power density calculated from the discharge curve is shown in Fig. 6b and demonstrates that the tri-layer structured film has a superior power density of 0.47 MW cm−3, which is more than ten times that of BOPP (i.e. 0.04 MW cm−3).

Additionally, the mechanical flexibility and robustness against bending deformations of dielectric materials are important properties for wound film capacitor cells (Fig. S7†).45 The tri-layered film with a thickness of 25 μm has been bent and unbent repeatedly at a bending curvature of 4 mm radius over 20000 cycles, and each cycle is programmed to be accomplished in 5 seconds, as shown in Fig. 7a and b and S8.† It is found from Fig. 7c and S9† that the bent sample retains the same discharged Ue and η as those of the original film at varied electric fields. As verified in the cross-sectional microscopic image (Fig. 7d), damaged interfaces were not found after rigorous bending. The excellent stability makes the designed materials more promising for practical capacitor applications.41

4. Conclusions
In summary, a series of ternary-trilayered architecture films were successfully prepared by a facile fully solution-casting technique. A high energy density of 11.8 J cm−3 along with an ultra-high efficiency of 89% at an applied field of 300 MV m−1 is obtained in the trilayered film with the optimized DE content, which represents the best overall energy storage performance achieved so far at relatively low electric fields from the currently available dielectric polymers and polymer composites. The enhanced Ue and η has been attributed to the synergistic effect of DE and PMMA as well as the layered architecture of the films. Dmax is improved via tailoring the loadings of the DE outer layers, while Drem is efficiently suppressed by the middle PMMA layer. Consequently, a large value of Dmax − Drem results in the outstanding energy storage performance at relatively low electric fields. Moreover, a superior power density of 0.47 MW cm−3 and a faster discharge speed of 9.2 μs are achieved in the trilayered film, which also outperform the benchmark BOPP. The layered films exhibit outstanding mechanical and energy storage performance stability in the consecutive bending tests. This work provides a promising paradigm for the design of flexible dielectric materials operating efficiently at relatively low electric fields.
