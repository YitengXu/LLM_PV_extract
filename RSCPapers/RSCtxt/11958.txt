    , Accepted 10th July 2019First published on 10th July 2019AbstractDonor–acceptor intermolecular interactions and/or arrangements are key factors determining the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, two ITIC-based isomeric acceptors (o-F-ITIC and m-F-ITIC) with fluorine atoms at ortho and meta positions within the side chains were developed. The developed acceptors showed different interactions and/or arrangements with the donor counterpart (PBDB-T), which caused a significant variation in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs. The PCE of the PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC device was 11.11% versus 8.90% of the PBDB-T:m-F-ITIC device. A detailed theoretical analysis of the intermolecular complexes formed between F-ITICs and PBDB-T allows a determination of how the two isomeric acceptors interact differently with PBDB-T. Relative to PBDB-T:m-F-ITIC with a preferential DCI–BDD complex, PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC showed a closer donor–acceptor interaction, with a tightly packed parallel-like DCI–BDT complex, resulting in larger interfacial areas. These behavioral characteristics explain in detail the experimental results obtained from the comparison of the two blend systems relating to electrical and morphological properties. Moreover, transient absorption spectroscopy of PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC revealed superior hole/electron transfer and separation processes, providing further evidence of the presence of beneficial intermolecular complexes. This study facilitates the understanding of the role of constitutional isomerism both in intermolecular interactions and in promoting the development of high-performance OSCs.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) comprising a blend active layer of a p-type electron donor and an n-type electron acceptor offer the prospect of low-cost, light-weight, and environmentally benign solar energy production.1–3 Mainly benefiting from the development of highly efficient donor materials, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of BHJ OSCs based on fullerene derivative acceptors have exceeded 10%.4–9 However, further improvements in fullerene-based OSCs are limited owing to the intrinsic shortcomings of the fullerene acceptors, such as synthetic difficulty in tuning their optical/electronic properties and their poor light absorbing capability. Therefore, non-fullerene small molecules have emerged as very promising electron acceptors in OSCs to overcome the above-mentioned issues, and PCEs beyond those of fullerene-based OSCs have been achieved in OSCs based on fused-ring-type non-fullerene acceptors.10–15 Among them, the most successful and representative acceptor is ITIC which contains an indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDT) core and 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (DCI) terminal groups.10,16–21 Therefore, considerable efforts have been devoted to modifying the structure of ITIC to adjust the absorption spectra and energy levels to further improve PCEs, for example, by changing the side chain type,22 bulkiness,23–26 and length;27 extending the conjugation length of the core and terminal groups;28–32 functionalizing the terminal groups (e.g., methylation, fluorination, and chlorination);13–15,32–34 and utilizing thienyl-fused DCI terminal analogs.35–39
It is well documented that the favorable donor–acceptor intermolecular interactions and/or arrangements present in the blend active layer of OSCs can play a major role in exciton dissociation, charge separation, and charge recombination processes.40–45 In line with this consideration, herein, we assume that subtle changes in the positioning of a single atom in ITIC (popularly called the constitutional isomerism effect) can strongly affect the intermolecular interactions and/or arrangements in OSCs, which are one of the crucial factors that govern their efficient operation. Although considerable research efforts have been devoted to modifying ITIC series including the modification of core units, terminal units, heteroatoms, and the bridges between the core and terminal units within ITIC-related backbones,46–48 the constitutional isomerism effect within the side chains remains unexplored.
In this study, to establish the structure–property relationship induced by constitutional isomerism, we synthesized two new ITIC-based isomeric acceptors (o-F-ITIC and m-F-ITIC) with fluorine atoms at ortho and meta positions in the side chains and did a comparative investigation on their photovoltaic properties. The o-F-ITIC OSC exhibits a PCE as high as 11.11%, significantly higher than that of the m-F-ITIC OSC (PCE = 8.90%), when employing poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (named PBDB-T) as a donor counterpart of the active layer. A detailed simulation analysis demonstrates that different donor–acceptor intermolecular complexes are formed between the F-ITIC acceptors and PBDB-T donor, which not only supports our hypothesis but also provides a possible explanation for the significant difference between the OSCs based on the two isomers. Moreover, experimental studies (e.g., electrical and morphological properties as well as exciton generation and charge transfer behaviors) through a broad range of techniques further elucidate the varied intermolecular complexes, as observed from the theoretical study. The results obtained from a combination of theoretical and experimental studies here advance the understanding of the role of constitutional isomerism in intermolecular interactions, thereby facilitating a molecular design of non-fullerene acceptors.
Results and discussion
Material design, characterization, and photovoltaic properties
The chemical structures and synthetic routes of o-F-ITIC and m-F-ITIC are illustrated in Scheme 1. First, 1-bromo-2-fluoro-4-hexylbenzene (1a) and 4-bromo-2-fluoro-1-hexylbenzene (1b) were used as the key isomeric side chains prepared through a copper-catalyzed alkyl–alkyl cross-coupling reaction with the commercially available chemicals (1-bromo-4-(bromomethyl)-2-fluorobenzene and 4-bromo-1-(bromomethyl)-2-fluorobenzene), respectively.49 A double nucleophilic addition between each of the freshly lithiated isomeric side chains and the ester groups of diethyl-2,5-bis(thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2-yl)terephthalate (2) was performed, which was followed by an acid-mediated Friedel–Crafts-type ring closing reaction, leading to seven-ring fused cores based on IDT (o-F-IT and m-F-IT). Finally, the target F-ITIC acceptor isomers with DCI as the terminal group (o-F-ITIC and m-F-ITIC) were synthesized by the well-documented means of subsequent Vilsmeier–Haack and Knoevenagel condensation reactions. Their chemical structures and qualities were analyzed through 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and mass spectroscopy (see the Experimental section).
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes of o-F-ITIC and m-F-ITIC. 
The optical properties of F-ITIC isomers were measured in chloroform solution and in a thin-film state; the relevant data are provided in Fig. 1a and Table 1. Both o-F-ITIC and m-F-ITIC show strong absorption bands from 550 nm to 730 nm in chloroform solution as well as redshifts of 20–30 nm in the film as a result of their solid-state packing. It is very interesting to note that, relative to m-F-ITIC, o-F-ITIC displays a more red-shifted absorption spectrum in both the solution and the film and a slightly lower optical bandgap (Eoptg) [1.58 eV (o-F-ITIC) versus 1.62 eV (m-F-ITIC)], which indicates its stronger chain aggregation properties. Note that in both solution and film states, o-F-ITIC showed larger extinction coefficients than the corresponding m-F-ITIC (Fig. S1†).

As shown in Fig. 1b, the cyclic voltammetry (CV)-derived highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies show little variation for o-F-ITIC (−5.66/−3.94 eV) and m-F-ITIC (−5.69/−3.96 eV). Additionally, their ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy-derived HOMOs deviate by only a small margin from the CV data (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). Collectively, the optical and electrochemical data demonstrate that different positioning of the fluorine atoms within the side chains can change the absorption profile by manipulating the molecular self-organization with minimal impact on the redox properties.
A well-known wide-bandgap polymer PBDB-T was selected as a counter donor to fabricate BHJ OSCs because it has well-complementary absorption associated with appropriate energy levels that can pair with the F-ITIC acceptors synthesized in this study. The device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al, where PDINO was used as the cathode interlayer material (Fig. 2a). The optimization involved varying the donor/acceptor ratio, the amount of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive, and thermal annealing temperature (see Tables S1–S6 in the ESI†). We found that, for the both blends (PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC and PBDB-T:m-F-ITIC), the optimal device performances were obtained by employing chlorobenzene with a donor:acceptor weight ratio of 1.3:1 and 0.5 vol% DIO additive, followed by thermal annealing at 60 °C for 10 min. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 2b, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The PBDB-T:m-F-ITIC device showed a short-circuit current (JSC) of 15.80 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.883 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 63.79%, yielding a PCE of 8.90%. For the PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC device, all photovoltaic parameters (JSC = 18.07 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.918 V, and FF = 66.97%) were improved, which resulted in a remarkably higher PCE of 11.11%. Note that the PBDB-T:ITIC-based device (F-free ITIC reference acceptor) yielded a PCE of 9.69% under the same device conditions, implying that rather than its density, the positioning of the fluorine atom plays a role in determining the device performance(see Fig. S3 and Table S7†).

As shown in Fig. 2c, in addition to good agreement between the JSC values obtained from the J–V measurement and those calculated by integrating the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, the PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC-based device showed higher EQE values in the most photo-response range from 300 to 800 nm compared to the PBDB-T:m-F-ITIC-based device. It is also noted that relative to both m-F-ITIC- and ITIC-based ones, the o-F-ITIC-based device has a stronger photo-response in the range from 600 nm to 800 nm, which is attributed to the higher extinction coefficients of o-F-ITIC (Fig. S1†). A little change in the intrinsic properties (e.g., in bandgaps and energy levels), as revealed by the comparison of isomers o-F-ITIC and m-F-ITIC, could be responsible, to some degree, for the observed difference in the photovoltaic performance; however, it is still insufficient to explain this. Therefore, we propose that the different fluorine positioning in the side chains of the F-ITIC acceptors induces different intermolecular interaction with the donor counterpart, resulting in the surprisingly large discrepancy between the devices based on o-F-ITIC and m-F-ITIC.
Computational study
The origin of difference in VOC values is not yet clear at the current stage. Therefore, we carried out additional density functional theory (DFT) calculations (GGA/PBE).50 For both F-ITICs, in addition to similar electron density distributions, the calculated energy levels show the same trend as observed in the CV and UPS data. The somewhat higher-lying HOMO level of o-F-ITIC is partially correlated with the higher VOC in the o-F-ITIC-based device (Fig. S4†). To understand the overall picture of the donor–acceptor intermolecular interactions and/or arrangements, we carried out an in-depth simulation study. First, by using all-atom molecular dynamics (AAMD), we predicted the stacked structures of the intermolecular complex formed between the F-ITIC acceptors and PBDB-T donor (Fig. 3a and b), showing a closer interaction between PBDB-T and o-F-ITIC with each other by ∼0.11 nm relative to the PBDB-T and m-F-ITIC case (Fig. S5†). Here, the trimer repeating units as a model of PBDB-T polymer was set up for the AAMD study. In addition, the intermolecular interaction behaviors were further traced by the radial distribution function (RDF), where each main backbone of PBDB-T and F-ITICs was arbitrarily divided into two constituting components [i.e., electron-rich donor–electron-deficient acceptor moieties, such as benzodithiophene (BDT)–dithienylbenzodithiophenedione (BDD) and IDT–DCI building units] (see Fig. 3c). For the PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC-based stacking state, the BDT, rather than BDD, unit of PBDB-T closely interacted with the DCI units of o-F-ITIC, whereas more interaction between the BDD of PBDB-T and DCI units of m-F-ITIC was observed in the m-F-ITIC-based device (Fig. 3d and e). Such different arrangements were furthermore shown by the binding configurations of the favorable DCI–BDT and DCI–BDD complexes formed from each of the o-F-ITIC- and m-F-ITIC-stacked structures, respectively (Fig. 3f and g). Note also that we observed face-to-face alignment between DCI of o-F-ITIC and BDT molecular planes (plane angle = ∼97°) compared to the DCI of m-F-ITIC and BDD cases (plane angle = ∼70°).

Stacking states between (f) the BDT unit of PBDB-T and the DCI unit of o-F-ITIC and (g) the BDD unit of PBDB-T and the DCI unit of m-F-ITIC. 
The probability distribution of dihedral angles of the fused IDT core of the F-ITICs shows that the IDT core of o-F-ITIC has a wider range for the dihedral angles than that of m-F-ITIC (Fig. 4a). This observation can be reasonably explained by the relatively high repulsive force between neighboring ortho-fluorine atoms on the side chains of o-F-ITIC, which are at a closer distance than meta-fluorine ones in the o-F-ITIC case (Fig. S6†). Therefore, the IDT core backbone of o-F-ITIC favors a slightly curved structure, thereby providing a unique parallel-like DCI–BDT packing, as observed in the stacked structure. In contrast, the relatively unbent IDT core of m-F-ITIC did not encourage a parallel-like DCI–BDD stacking structure with PBDB-T. These behavioral characteristics helped to understand why a higher population of the DCI–BDT stacked complex was observed in the configuration of PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC versus DCI–BDD of PBDB-T:m-F-ITIC (see the yellow-colored molecules in Fig. 3a and b). Furthermore, such varied configurations influence the electron density distributions of the HOMO and LUMO for the optimized stacked structures. For PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC, the LUMO is mainly localized on PBDB-T, whereas the HOMO is concentrated on o-F-ITIC. On the other hand, PBDB-T:m-F-ITIC has both LUMO and HOMO more distributed on PBDB-T units (Fig. 4b and c). Superficially, relative to PBDB-T:m-F-ITIC, the PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC system is expected to be favorable for charge transfer.

To gain more insights into the macroscopic morphology induced by the PBDB-T:F-ITIC complexes, we investigated, through coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) using the Martini force field, where the PBDB-T chains containing six repeating units were used for CGMD models.51 The CG models and their structural properties (e.g., various angle distributions in the backbones of each molecule) are described in detail (Fig. S7 and S8†). The number densities of both stacked structures, which represent the number of CG beads projected on the x–y plane per unit area, are shown in Fig. 5a and b, which indicate that PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC has larger interfacial areas with a higher density compared to PBDB-T:m-F-ITIC. Additionally, the average surface areas are estimated to be 178.1 nm2 and 163.5 nm2 for PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC and PBDB-T:m-F-ITIC, respectively (Fig. 5c), wherein the PBDB-T backbone is less folded in PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC, which is evidenced by a comparison of the end-to-end distance of PBDB-T in the stacked structures (Fig. 5d).

(e) RDF of DCI of F-ITICs and BDT of PBDB-T in thin films. 
Additionally, as shown in Fig. 5e, the CGMD-derived RDF result provides further confirmation of a stronger DCI–BDT interaction in PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC found through the AAMD analysis. Collectively, the thorough theoretical studies demonstrate that changing the position of the fluorine atom within the side chains of the acceptors significantly influences the intermolecular stacking arrangement when admixed with the counterpart donor polymer, giving rise to a significant difference in the BHJ device performances, as the most likely factor in differentiating charge carrier dynamics (e.g., exciton dissociation, charge transport, and charge recombination).
Charge generation, dissociation, and transport properties
To better understand this significant difference between the devices based on the two isomers o-F-ITIC and m-F-ITIC, the carrier hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of all blends were first estimated by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. 6a).52–54 Despite the observation of similar μh values for both the blends (∼5.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), the μe value (4.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) of the o-F-ITIC blend film is almost an order of magnitude higher than that of the m-F-ITIC-based one (3.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Consequently, the μh/μe ratios are more balanced for the o-F-ITIC blend film (1.32) compared to the m-F-ITIC film (13.8). These features should be very beneficial for not only promoting charge carrier transport to the electrodes but also reducing the build-up of space charges. Note that we also measured the μes of neat F-ITIC films, revealing o-F-ITIC (μe = 4.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) versus m-F-ITIC (μe = 9.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Fig. S9†).

(d) JPhversus Veff characteristics of the optimized devices with PBDB-T:F-ITICs. 
The charge recombination mechanism in the devices was evaluated by analyzing their J–V characteristics as a function of light intensity (P) (Fig. 6b). In general, the JSC and P values follow the power-law functional relationship JSC ∝ Pα, where α represents the exponential factor related to bimolecular recombination.55,56 The α values of o-F-ITIC- and m-F-ITIC-based devices are 0.96 and 0.94, respectively, suggesting that the bimolecular recombination is somewhat more suppressed in the o-F-ITIC-based device. This correlates well with the charge carrier transport properties discussed earlier. Additionally, the VOC dependence on P could be expressed by the natural logarithmic formula of VOC ∝ n(κT/q)lnP, where κ, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature, and elementary charge, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6c, the fitted n for the o-F-ITIC- and m-F-ITIC-based OSCs is 1.54 and 1.75, respectively, indicating that geminate or Shockley–Read–Hall recombination occurs to a somewhat reduced extent in the o-F-ITIC-based device.55,56
Furthermore, photogenerated current density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves were plotted to evaluate the exciton dissociation and charge collection in the two devices (Fig. 6d). Jph (Jph = JL − JD) is obtained by subtracting the current density in the dark (JD) from the current density under light (JL); Veff is defined as V0 − Va, where V0 and Va can be obtained during testing JL and JD.57,58Jph reaches the saturation value (Jsat) at Veff > 1.0 V for all devices, at which point all photogenerated excitons dissociate into free charge carriers and collect at the electrodes. A higher Jsat value for the o-F-ITIC-based device is observed, indicating an enhancement in charge generation. The charge recombination probability (Jph/Jsat) can be extracted from Jph − Veff under short-circuit conditions. Under short-circuit conditions, the Jph/Jsat values in the o-F-ITIC-based and the m-F-ITIC-based systems are 98% and 94%, respectively, implying that the o-F-ITIC-based device reduces geminate recombination loss.57,58 Furthermore, under maximum power output conditions, the o-F-ITIC-based device (89%) also shows a higher Jph/Jsat than the m-F-ITIC-based device (68%). These results confirm that better exciton dissociations and charge carrier extractions occur in the o-F-ITIC-based device relative to the m-F-ITIC-based device. Overall, the superior charge generation, dissociation, and transport properties of the o-F-ITIC-based OSC are in accordance with the enhanced JSC and FF values. Considering that such electrical discrepancy between the devices based on isomers o-F-ITIC and m-F-ITIC should have a strong correlation with the different BHJ blend morphologies, as evidenced by the aforementioned simulation studies, detailed investigations on the morphological characteristics of the two blends are conducted and discussed in the following section.
Morphological characterization
First, the surface and bulk morphologies of the blend films were examined by using atomic force spectroscopy (AFM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements. The AFM images, as shown in Fig. S10a and b,† reveal that the o-F-ITIC-based blend has a slightly smoother surface with a smaller root-mean square (RMS) of 1.79 nm (versus 2.03 nm for the m-F-ITIC-based blend). This could be the result of the different intermolecular interactions and aggregations of the two acceptor isomers with the PBDB-T counterpart donor. From the STEM images, shown in Fig. S11a and b,† it can be seen that the o-F-ITIC-based blend shows a finely distributed fibril-like structure, indicating that o-F-ITIC was well spread in the PBDB-T polymer matrix. In contrast, some m-F-ITIC aggregates appear as dark spots in the TEM image of the m-F-ITIC-based blend. The obvious difference in the blend morphologies is further elucidated by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) (Fig. S12a and b in the ESI†), wherein, relative to m-F-ITIC, the greenish dots derived from fluoride atoms of the o-F-ITIC acceptor are well dispersed throughout. The finely intermixed morphology between PBDB-T and o-F-ITIC components can induce large donor–acceptor interfacial areas, as confirmed by the CGMD results discussed earlier, thereby facilitating favorable photocurrent generation and transport and leading to an improved performance of the o-F-ITIC-based OSC.
Molecular ordering and interchain organization of PBDB-T and F-ITICs for neat and blend films were further investigated by using grazing-incidence wide-angle (GIWAXS) analysis.59 The corresponding scattering parameters are displayed in Table S8.† As shown in Fig. 7a and b, both neat F-ITIC acceptor films exhibit in-plane (IP) lamellar (100) scattering and a strong out-of-plane (OOP) π–π stacking (010) peak, implying a preferential face-on crystalline orientation. It is interesting to note that the calculated π–π stacking distance of the o-F-ITIC film (3.6 Å) is smaller than that of m-F-ITIC (4.1 Å), partially explaining the observed higher μes of o-F-ITICs relative to m-ITIC in both neat and blend cases. Moreover, a closer look reveals a more-resolved anisotropic IP lamellar peak in the o-F-ITIC film, which is most likely related to the different self-organization behavior as a function of the fluorine position on the side chains. Note also that the crystallite coherence length (CCL010) calculated by using the Scherrer equation60 is 2.14 nm for the o-F-ITIC film and 1.03 nm for the m-F-ITIC film, which signifies a higher crystalline feature of o-F-ITIC. One can conclude that o-F-ITIC has quite more ordered molecular packing with the higher crystalline feature, which is favorable for electron transport. On the other hand, the azimuthal (100) peak and the OOP π–π stacking (010) peak were observed in the neat PBDB-T film, as shown in Fig. S13† and reported in our previous work.61
 Fig. 7  2D GIWAXS images with films composed of (a) o-F-ITIC, (b) m-F-ITIC, (c) a blend of PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC, and (d) a blend of PBDB-T:m-F-ITIC, respectively. 
Both the blend films produced an OOP (010) π–π stacking peak centered at 1.6–1.7 Å−1 with an arc-like lamellar (100) peak at 0.29 Å−1. Looking cursorily at the images in Fig. 7c and d, it is rather difficult to determine the difference between GIWAXS patterns for both the blends because of the overlaps of the peaks induced by two PBDB-T and F-ITICs. However, on a closer examination of the GIWAXS parameters, it can be found that the PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC blend shows a slightly larger CCL010 together with a smaller π-stacking distance compared to that of PBDB-T:m-F-ITIC. This trend provides evidence for enhanced phase purity between PBDB-T and o-F-ITIC induced by the well-intermixed blend morphology, which is consistent with the aforementioned morphological and theoretical results.
Photophysics
The exciton generation and charge transfer of photo-induced carriers were further investigated by transient absorption (TA) measurements. The TA spectra of the neat films were first collected by employing two distinct pump wavelengths of 500 nm and 710 nm for the PBDB-T donor and F-ITIC acceptors, respectively, which allowed the temporal evolution of the TA signals to be extracted for the individual component (see Fig. S14†). Next, the pump-induced differential change in the probe transmission, ΔT/T = (Tpump-on − Tpump-off)/Tpump-off, was measured. At each selected excitation, the PBDB-T donor and F-ITIC acceptors gave broad photo-induced absorptions centered at ∼640 nm and ∼730 nm, respectively (Fig. 8a). With excitation at 710 nm, no bleaching signal was found in neat PBDB-T, which was only excited at 500 nm; however, both the neat F-ITIC acceptors gave bleaching signals at ∼650 nm and ∼730 nm (Fig. S14 and S15†). For both the blends excited at 710 nm, in addition to the signals of F-ITIC acceptors, bleaching signals below 640 nm derived from PBDB-T were observed (Fig. 8b). In both blends, we observed an increase in the bleaching signals of PBDB-T (<640 nm), accompanied by the decay of the signals of F-ITICs. It is apparent from the shorter time scale TA data in the blend films with respect to the corresponding neat F-ITIC acceptors (Fig. S16a and b†), which is indicative of faster hole transfer in the blends. The early-stage decay kinetics of excitons are also characterized by an exponential fit, as shown in Fig. 8c. A shorter decay lifetime parameter (2.9 ps) is observed for the o-F-ITIC-based blend (versus 4.2 ps for the m-F-ITIC-based blend), thereby suggesting its more efficient hole transfer process.
 Fig. 8  (a) TA spectra from the neat PBDB-T and F-ITICs collected at an excitation pump wavelength of 500 nm and 710 nm, respectively. (b) TA signal and (c) TA dynamics curves probed at 586 nm recorded from the films of PBDB-T:F-ITIC blends excited at a pump wavelength of 710 nm. 
Revisiting the TA data shown in Fig. 8a, it can be seen that the neat PBDB-T and F-ITICs clearly featured very broad excited state absorption (ESA) peaks centered at ∼960 nm and ∼1200 nm, respectively. Therefore, we measured the TA spectra of both the blends (PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC and PBDB-T:m-F-ITIC) with the donor excited at 500 nm to further investigate the charge transfer between the donor and acceptor components. In both the blends, as shown in Fig. 9a, only the ESA signal at ∼960 nm, mainly assigned to F-ITICs, appeared without the signal at ∼1170 nm seen in the neat film of PBDB-T (Fig. S14a†), thereby suggesting proper electron transfer from photo-excited PBDB-T to the F-ITIC acceptors. Note that PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC shows a higher intensity ESA signal than PBDB-T:m-F-ITIC, which is consistent with the trend of the bleaching signals induced by the blends excited at 710 nm. Moreover, both the blends exhibited a shorter bi-exponential fitting decay lifetime of the ESA signals at around 1200 nm (0.36–0.41 ps) than the neat PBDB-T donor film (1.52 ps) (Fig. 9b), which is again similar to the above TA data with the excitation at 710 nm. However, a very small difference between the lifetimes of the two blends makes it difficult for us to conclude that the higher PCE of PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC stems from this process just from our fitting results of the electron transfer rate. Therefore, we further analyzed the polaron lifetimes of both blend films from the polaron ESA band probed at 930 nm by using nanosecond-resolved TA measurements (Fig. 9c). Here, compared to the m-F-ITIC-based one (10.95 ns and 214.68 ns), the o-F-ITIC-based blend clearly exhibited longer polaron lifetimes (20.88 ns and 257.23 ns), which implied an increased polaron generation in this device through the reduced recombination mechanism, which may explain the reason why the EQE curve of PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC exceeds that of PBDB-T:m-F-ITIC at around 500 nm.

Conclusion
In summary, this study provides the synthesis and characterization of two new ITIC-based isomeric acceptors (o-F-ITIC and m-F-ITIC) with fluorine atoms at ortho and meta positions within the side chains, with the aim to study the fluorine-positioning effect on the intermolecular interaction with the donor counterpart (PBDB-T) strongly associated with BHJ OSC performances. We observe a significant difference between the OSCs based on the two isomers, which makes the different donor–acceptor intermolecular interactions and/or arrangements evident. In particular, the PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC device (PCE = 11.11%) outperforms the PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC device (PCE = 8.90%), with all its photovoltaic parameters higher than those of PBDB-T:m-F-ITIC. From detailed simulation studies, we found that the PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC system has a closer donor–acceptor interaction with a tightly stacked parallel-like DCI–BDT complex, leading to larger interfacial areas with a higher density, compared to PBDB-T:m-F-ITIC possessing a favorable DCI–BDD complex. These results correlate quite well with the observation of enhanced electrical characteristics (e.g., charge transport, generation, and recombination loss) in PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC, attributed to the well-intermixed blend morphology. Moreover, it appears from TA spectra that PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC has more efficient hole/electron transfer and separation processes relative to PBDB-T:m-F-ITIC. The theoretical and experimental results presented here demonstrate that even changing only the position of a single atom (popularly called constitutional isomerism) in the side chains can significantly affect the donor–acceptor interaction properties in blends. This finding can open new pathways to evaluate the structure–property–performance relationships.

Materials and characterization
All starting materials were purchased from Aldrich and Acros and used without further purification. All solvents are of ACS grade unless otherwise noted. Diethyl-2,5-bis(thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2-yl)terephthalate (2),62 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (DCI),63 and poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) were prepared according to reported procedures.641H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a VNMRS 400 MHz spectrophotometer using CDCl3 as solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Cary 5000 (Varian USA) spectrophotometer. For UV-vis spectra of F-ITICs, their solutions (2.00 mg mL−1 in chloroform) were used and the films were prepared by deposition from the 20 mg mL−1 concentrated chlorobenzene solution via the spin-casting method at 1000 rpm. The optical bandgaps were estimated from the absorption onset of the as-cast thin films. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on a Solartron electrochemical station (METEK, Versa STAT3) with a three-electrode cell in a 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) solution in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature under argon. A Ag/Ag+ electrode, a platinum wire, and a platinum electrode were used as the reference electrode, counter electrode, and working electrode, respectively. The Ag/Ag+ reference electrode was calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple as an external standard, whose oxidation potential is set at 4.8 eV with respect to a zero vacuum level. The HOMO energy levels were obtained from the equation HOMO (eV) = −(Eonset(ox) − Eonset(ferrocene) + 4.8). The LUMO levels of the polymers were obtained from the equation LUMO (eV) = −(Eonset(red) − Eonset(ferrocene) + 4.8). The UPS measurement was carried out using an AXIS-NOVA (Kratos, Inc.) with a base pressure of 4.2 × 10−9 Torr. AFM was performed using a Bruker Dimension Icon Atomic Force Microscope with an RTESP-150 probe in the standard tapping mode. GIWAXS was conducted at the PLS-II 6D UNIST-PAL beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory in Korea. The X-rays coming from the in-vacuum undulator were monochromated (λ = 1.10994 Å) using a double crystal monochromator and focused both horizontally and vertically (450 (H) × 60 (V) μm2 in FWHM (full width at half maximum) @sample position) using K–B type mirrors. The GIWAXS sample stage was equipped with a 7-axis motorized stage for the fine alignment of the sample, and the incidence angle of the X-ray beam was set to be 0.13° for the neat and blend films. The GIWAXS patterns were recorded with a 2D CCD detector (Rayonix SX165) and the X-ray irradiation time was 6–9 s, dependent on the saturation level of the detector. Diffraction angles were calibrated using a sucrose standard (monoclinic, P21, a = 10.8631 Å, b = 8.7044 Å, c = 7.7624 Å, and β = 102.938°) and the sample-to-detector distance was ≈231 mm. STEM and EDAX measurements were performed on a JEOL USA JEM-2100F Transmission Electron Microscope, with samples prepared under the same conditions as the optimized active layer in the device on PEDOT:PSS. The transient absorption (TA) measurement was performed using a regenerative amplifier (Libra, Coherent, 1 kHz, 90 fs) with a tunable wavelength and analyzed using a highspeed charge-coupled device (S11071-1104, Hamamatsu) with a monochromator (Acton 2358, Princeton Instrument) at 1 kHz enabled by a custom-built board from Entwicklungsbuero Stresing. The angle between the polarizations of the pump and probe beam was set at the magic angle.

Device fabrication and characterization
Patterned ITO glass substrates (15 Ω−1) were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, distilled water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, and then dried in an oven overnight at 70 °C. The cleaned ITOs were treated with oxygen plasma for 5 min and then a thin PEDOT:PSS (Bayer Baytron 4083) layer was deposited over the ITO surface at 4000 rpm. After being sequentially annealed at 130 °C for 10 min, the substrates were transferred to a nitrogen filled glove box. The mixed solutions of PBDB-T:F-ITICs (1:1, 1.3:1, 1.5:1 and 2:1 w/w) with a donor concentration of 10 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene containing 0–2% (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane were spin-coated on the top of the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO glass, followed by a thermal annealing treatment at 60–180 °C for 10 min, and then methanol solution of PDINO (1.0 mg mL−1) was deposited onto the active layer with a spin rate of 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 100 nm aluminum was thermally evaporated under vacuum (<5.0 × 10−5 Pa). The active area of each sample was 13.0 mm2. The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source under illumination of an AM 1.5G solar simulator with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were conducted using a Model QEX7 from PV measurements Inc. (Boulder, Colorado) in ambient air. The thickness of the active layers was measured using a stylus profilometer (P6, KLA Tencor). The hole and electron mobilities were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Device structures are ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au for hole-only devices and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al for electron-only devices, respectively. The SCLC mobilities were calculated using the Mott–Gurney equation:  where εr is the relative dielectric constant of the organic semiconductor, ε0 is the permittivity of empty space, μ is the mobility of zero-field, L is the thickness of the active layer, and V = Vapplied − Vbuilt-in − Vseries-resistance (the Vbi values are 0.2 V and 0 V for the hole-only and the electron-only devices, respectively), where Vapplied is the voltage applied, and Vbuilt-in is the built-in voltage from the relative work function difference between the two electrodes. Vseries-resistance is the voltage caused by the series and contact resistance potential drop (Vseries-resistance = J × Rseries-resistance). For convenience, the voltage drops caused by this resistance (Rseries-resistance) was ignored.
Simulation details

Density functional theory (DFT). 
DFT calculation using the DMol3 program was performed to obtain optimal molecular structures of PBDB-T (e.g., trimer), o-F-ITIC, and m-F-ITIC.65,66 For the frontier orbital (i.e., HOMO and LUMO) calculations, the aliphatic side chains were substituted with methyl groups since the reduction of the molecular model did not affect the HOMO/LUMO energy levels.67 Initial molecular structures for geometry optimization of PBDB-T:o-F-ITIC and PBDB-T:m-F-ITIC were from MD trajectory. We used the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional,50 which showed similar band gap results for PBDB-T and F-ITICs calculated by using the B3LYP functional.5 Semi-empirical dispersion-correction by using Tkatchenko and Scheffler's scheme and spin-polarized calculations with the DNP 4.4 basis set were included.68 The convergence criteria for the geometry optimization were 1.0 × 10−5 Ha energy, 0.002 Ha Å−1 force, and 0.005 Å displacement, respectively.


All-atom molecular dynamics (AAMD). 
All-atom molecular dynamics (AAMD) was performed with the COMPASS II force field to study the stacking states of PBDB-T and F-ITICs.69 Following the experimental conditions, 4 PBDB-T (trimer) and 250 chlorobenzene molecules were packed in boxes of 4.5 × 4.5 × 4.5 nm3 and 4 o-F-ITIC and m-F-ITIC were included, respectively. NPT (i.e., isothermal–isobaric) simulations were performed for 2 ns at 318 K and chlorobenzene molecules were removed to assume the evaporated state. Sequential NPT simulations were performed for 3 ns at 333 K and for 3 ns at 298 K. The time step was 1 fs and the Berendsen barostat and thermostat were applied to control the pressure and temperature. Radial distribution function and angle distribution analysis were done with the trajectory of final 2 ns. The trimer of PBDB-T was used, which was able to form stacking sites with F-ITICs, and we confirmed that interaction sites with F-ITICs were the same as those of PBDB-T with eight repeating units.70


Coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD). 
Coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) was performed with the Martini force field to investigate the morphology of thin films of PBDB-T and F-ITICs.51 Coarse-grained bead mappings of PBDB-T and F-ITICs were obtained to construct an atomic model with a similar structure (Fig. S7†). The monomer of PBDB-T was composed of 24 beads and the number of monomers was 6 for the thin film system. o-F-ITIC and m-F-ITIC were composed of 38 constituent CG beads, respectively. CG models of o-F-ITIC and m-F-ITIC were the same, except the angle potential model (Fig. S8†). For chlorobenzene, 3 CG beads were used in a triangular shape. To keep the planar structure of molecules, elastic bond and angle potential were applied by harmonic potential with a force constant of 10000 kJ mol−1.71 Angle and dihedral angle distributions were obtained from NVT simulation for 5 ns in boxes of 40 × 40 × 40 nm3, which were composed of one molecule of PBDB-T, o-F-ITIC and m-F-ITIC, respectively, and compared with those of the all-atom model. Probability distributions of angles and dihedral angles were analyzed with the trajectory of final 2 ns. Simulation systems for investigating the morphology of thin films were composed of 72216, and 10280 molecules of PBDB-T, F-ITICs and chlorobenzene in boxes of 30 × 30 × 5 nm3. NPT simulations were performed for 100 ns at 318 K. The final configurations were replicated twice along x- and y-axes and the chlorobenzene molecules were removed. NPT simulations were performed for 500 ns at 333 K and annealing treatment was performed for 15 ns from 333 K to 298 K, sequentially, with 288 PBDB-T and 864 F-ITIC molecules. The interval of annealing temperature and simulation time were 10 K and 500 ps, respectively. Finally, NPT simulation was performed for 485 ns at 298 K. The end-to-end distance of PBDB-T was calculated between the BDT CG beads at the end of the polymer. The time step was 10 fs and the Parrinello–Rahman barostat and a velocity rescaling thermostat were used. The cut-off radius of van der Waals interaction was 1.2 nm and the GROMACS 5.0.6 package was used for CGMD simulations.72
