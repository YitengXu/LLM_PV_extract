    , Accepted 17th November 2011First published on 22nd December 2011AbstractFilms of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) [P3HT] were monitored for degradation by means of in situ fluorescence quenching measurements. The films were found to be stable under UV or VIS energy illumination in vacuo and stable to the air when kept in the dark. Under illumination in air however, degradation products were formed immediately as seen by the fluorescence quenching. The quantum yield for defect product formation was calculated to be around 3 × 10−6 per incident photon of above band-gap energy, a relatively rapid reaction that could create over 1016 defects per cm3 in optically thin films of P3HT in less than a second under sunlight, or in only a matter of minutes under room lighting. The degradation pathway is thought to involve attack of ground state molecular oxygen on the P3HT excited state. The reaction itself is self-inhibiting, as the P3HT excited state is thought to be effectively quenched by the increasing formation of defects, leading to slower and slower defect formation until the film enters a ‘quasi-stable’ state where no further degradation by this mechanism will occur. The upper limit to the number of defects to be found in films of P3HT formed by this mechanism is estimated to be around 2 × 1017 cm−3.
Introduction
Organic semiconductors, and in particular conjugated polymer semiconductors, are promising materials for use in future electronic components such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), field effect transistors (OFETs) and solar cells (OSCs). Polymer semiconductor electronics are potentially cheaper, lighter and more flexible than their silicon counterparts and while in the past performance has been poor, new materials and recent advances in understanding have improved performance sufficiently such that performance is now satisfactory for many applications. There remains however a challenge to be overcome in the lifetime and stability of organic semiconductors and whether devices made from these materials will have sufficient lifetime for them to achieve commercial success.
Studies on the degradation behaviour of polymer electronic devices are therefore timely and a topic of intense study. Already several possible degradation problems for conjugated polymer devices have been identified in the literature. These mechanisms can be roughly divided into either intrinsic problems, those that occur inherently in the working device, such as charge accumulation,1–5 and extrinsic problems, such as attack on the device by components in the air.6–14 Extrinsically, the porosity of organic materials to various atmospheric gases, in particular oxygen and water vapour from the air, means air is a major cause of device instability. The nature of the changes to device performance differs by device type; for instance water vapour is thought to adsorb onto the dielectric gate in FETs1,15 causing trapped charges and an increase in off-state current, while in organic solar cells, water vapour is thought to attack the metal cathode16,17 as well as swell the hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS layer.18 In FETs and OSCs, ground state oxygen (O2) has been reported to dope the material1,15,19–23 causing not only increases in conductivity, but also detrimental increases in trapped charges. Oxygen in the air is also thought to oxidise the electrodes,16 and critically for all types of devices, is thought to degrade the active polymer semiconductor material itself.24–39 To date, only a handful of studies have focussed on the degradation of the active polymer material alone, when not part of a device. Clearly, studies of polymer degradation alone are one-step dislocated away from device stability issues, where other factors such as changes to electrodes may dominate, but nevertheless an understanding of how the active material degrades will help isolate device degradation as either changes to the polymer active material or due to other factors, and hence such studies are valuable to researchers.
Of the polymer degradation studies available, studies have primarily focused on the prevalent polyphenylvinylene (PPV)24–29 and polythiophene (PT)26,29–35,37–40 family of polymers. A degradation pathway for conjugated polymers that is well supported by studies is oxidationvia radical formation.24,35,36,38,41Polymers stripped of a bonding pair electron (one of the two electrons in a covalent bond) by unstable free radicals, then themselves become radicals and react with an oxygen source from the air to give oxygenated side chains (esters), incorporation of oxygen into the polymer backbone, and in the case of polythiophene, forms of oxidised sulfur.41,42 Reaction with ozone (O3) is also considered to efficiently degrade conjugated polymers,42–44 however it is still unclear whether its concentration in air is sufficient for ozone to be considered a relevant source of degradation. Similarly, a few reports have highlighted the role of singlet oxygen, an unstable high-energy form of ground state oxygen and a well known oxidising agent of organic compounds,40,45,46 in the degradation of polymers. More recent results however suggest some conjugated polymers, such as polythiophene, may be unreactive to singlet oxygen.30,47 For instance, films of P3HT have been found to be resistant to excess chemically generated singlet oxygen,30 while the photo-oxidation rate of a PPV polymer in solution was found to be reduced by triplet excited state quenchers rather than the presence of singlet oxygen quenchers.47 The inference of these results is that singlet oxygen may not be that potent an oxidising agent for each and every conjugated polymer. In the latter case with a PPV polymer, an alternative oxidation pathway to singlet oxygen attack involving attack on the PPV polymer excited state by ground state oxygen was suggested to be occurring instead.
In this report we discuss the degradation of one of the most widely used conjugated polymer semiconductors, regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) [P3HT] as monitored by fluorescence quenching (for the structure see the inset in Fig. 1). As conjugated polymer emission is known to be easily quenched at defect sites, the loss of fluorescence can be a precise yet simple tool for monitoring degradation in conjugated polymers. In contrast to previous studies, that have demonstrated changes to P3HT only after several hours under intense illumination, we show significant degradation to P3HT occurs in only a matter of minutes under room lighting. We will demonstrate the conditions that lead to this degradation, and suggest that, contrary to prevailing theories of singlet oxygen or free radical attack, the crucial initial damage to P3HT proceeds via attack of the conjugated polymer excited state by ground state oxygen in the air. Finally we speculate what effect this degradation mechanism will have on device performance.
 Fig. 1  Emission yield from a film of P3HT following a period of light irradiation at 266 nm under vacuum, 532 nm under vacuum, and then a period of exposure to air in the dark. Note the immediate small dip in emissive yield upon changing from vacuum to air is likely due to changes in refractive index of the medium and hence a small change in the emission pathway. 
Experimental

        P3HT is from Aldrich (sample code: 445703) and has the stated properties Mw 87 kDa, PDI < 2, regioregularity of 98.5%. The absorption spectrum of the P3HT films used was taken with a Shimadzu UV-3100PC Spectrometer. The P3HT thin films were fabricated by spin-coating from chlorobenzene solutions and the film thickness was controlled by varying the concentration of P3HT solutions. Typical film thickness was around 60 nm, as judged by the absorbance spectra. The films were fabricated in air but in a darkened room and immediately after spin-coating enclosed in a nitrogen gas purged quartz sample chamber. Despite the above efforts to prevent any degradation during the fabrication and set-up process, due to the rapid degradation in air, some minor degradation may have occurred. The fluorescence intensity and the fluorescence spectra were measured by a Hitachi 850 Fluorescence Spectrometer, with the excitation wavelength set at 532 nm and probe wavelength at 640 nm (which was the fluorimeter peak response to P3HT emission) or as otherwise indicated in the text. Slit widths were 5 nm and 10 nm for the excitation and emission slits respectively and long pass filters (570 or 610 nm) were used in front of the emission slit to cut scatter of the excitation light reaching the detector. The degradation and emission intensity monitoring were performed in situ with the excitation light also acting as the light source for degradation. In Fig. 2 white light excitation was used and this was achieved by passing the full spectrum of the lamp through the monochromator (set to 0) and using 650 nm short pass and 410 nm long pass filters to attenuate the light source so that only visible region light would irradiate the sample. In this specific case emission was collected at 700 nm to avoid scatter of the excitation beam entering the emission slit. A rotary pump was used to provide vacuum with an optimal pressure of 10−1 Pa and a valve used to open the sample chamber to air.
 Fig. 2  Emission yield from a film of P3HT under different conditions (i) under illumination with 532 nm light in air (19 μW cm−2); (ii) a ‘recovery’ period of 3 hours under dark and vacuum; (iii) under illumination in a vacuum; and (iv) back under illumination in air. Note the changes to the scaling of the x-axis. Defect density was calculated with eqn (3). 
The emissive lifetime was measured by a Horiba Fluorocube single-photon counting system using a 408 nm NanoLED (rise time < 200 ps; 1 MHz). For the lifetime measurements the films underwent controlled degradation in air under a uniform intensity light beam at 532 nm of 100 mW cm−2. The sample was placed under nitrogen in the quartz sample chamber before carrying out the lifetime measurement. Picosecond time-resolved emission was measured using a C334 Hamamatsu streak camera (manufacturer states a 50 ps rise time) with 532 nm pump pulses provided by a Hurricane femtosecond laser, using the 800 nm fundamental light passed through an OPA to generate visible region light. Excitation light at 532 nm was purified by an optical prism and bandpass filter, with additional ‘cold’ filters to remove any IR light in the beam. Scattered pump light from the sample was blocked from reaching the streak camera by using a 560 nm high-pass filter.
Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) measurements were done in transmission mode on a Bruker Optics Vertex 80V machine with a vacuum sample chamber using a drop cast 8 micron thick film of P3HT on a CaF2 substrate. Results in ATR (attenuated total reflection) mode using a Perkin Elmer One with a thinner 100 nm thick film of P3HT showed similar results. AM1.5G 1 Sun illumination was provided by an Asahi Spectrum Max 301 Compact Xenon Light Source, calibrated with a purpose built power meter but with an additional 420 nm long-pass cut off filter added to cut any UV photons. The film thickness was measured with a Dektak 8 Advanced Development Profiler.
All tests were done in the summer with humidities and temperatures around 70% RH and 28 °C, except for the transmission mode FTIR which was done in the winter with humidities and temperatures around 40% RH and 17 °C.
Results
The fluorescence emission intensity from a film of P3HT was tested in a single continuous run, with the sample conditions varied and the rate of loss in emission intensity measured accordingly (divided into Fig. 1 and 2). To establish some baseline to the experiment, the sample stability to light exposure under vacuum was tested. Polythiophenes and P3HT have been reported to be light-stable in inert atmospheres34,48 however for conjugated systems there are potential degradation mechanisms, such as free radical crosspolymerisation or double-bond double-bond crosslinking, which can be initiated by photon absorption, especially with photons of energy in the UV range.49 With the P3HT film in the quartz sample chamber, the air was removed using a rotary pump and the film exposed to light illumination in the UV (266 nm) and visible (532 nm) region. After 20 minutes of illumination with UV light, the emission yield from P3HT had not changed (see Fig. 1) and the same was true for over 30 minutes of light irradiation at 532 nm. P3HT therefore appears to be stable to illumination to both UV and visible region light, with no suggestion of any degradation having occurred. Note that the shape of the emission spectra from P3HT was the same at both wavelengths. The increase in emission yield when changing from 266 nm to 532 nm is due to the larger absorption coefficient of the film at 532 nm compared to 266 nm and due to more intense light from the lamp in the visible region.
We next tested the stability of P3HT to air but in the dark (light off, Fig.1). The sample was exposed to air and the emission yield checked every 10 minutes for any change (measurement took 4 seconds). Even after 40 minutes of exposure to air however, the emission yield from the film was unchanged. The diffusion of air into a film of P3HT is not thought to be a mediating factor,50–52 but to check, a thinner film of P3HT (around 10 nm thick), where air would be expected to penetrate into the bulk of the film much more quickly, was also tested and this gave similar results. The stability of the PL emission suggests that despite absorption of air into the film, in the dark P3HT does not react with any component of the air. Previously it has been proposed that P3HT could be forming a ground-state charge-transfer complex with O2 molecules.53,54 That no emission quenching is observed when the film was exposed to O2 from the air would seem to be contrary to this suggestion as charge transfer states would be expected to lead to quenching of P3HT fluorescence. An alternative explanation to the reported interaction between P3HT and O2 in charge mobility data may be an interaction between O2 and positive polarons as has been reported elsewhere.1,54
Under exposure to 532 nm light in air (Fig. 2), we immediately began to see a decrease in the emission yield from the film. Over the course of around 40 minutes the emission yield dropped 18%. A loss in fluorescence yield is in keeping with previous reports of P3HT instability to light in air. To test if the loss was reversible, the film was then placed back under vacuum and darkness for three hours.54 After 3 hours however, no recovery of the film emission was observed suggesting that the degradation of P3HT was permanent and irreversible. The quenching centres are, therefore, unlikely to be absorbed gas molecules (further evidence against O2 charge transfer states), and are more likely to be atoms or molecules which are now chemically bound to P3HT. Since the emission intensity from the film did not drop further over the 3 hours in the darkness or over a subsequent 20 min period illuminated under vacuum, the defect quenching sites themselves appear to be stable, and they do not initiate any further film degradation by themselves. When the film was again exposed to illumination in air the emission yield again began to decrease, but at this point the rate in emission loss was not as quick as when the film was pristine, suggesting that the degradation has been accumulative and supports that none of the previous degradation was reversed by the three hours under vacuum.
To further study the degradation, the rate of emission loss as a function of incident light intensity was explored (Fig. 3). To increase the photon density striking the sample ‘white’ light from the fluorimeter excitation lamp between 410 and 650 nm was used using a set of long and short pass filters. The intensity of illumination is roughly equivalent to that present at 1 sun in this wavelength range. To decrease the photon density striking the sample, the film was only exposed to the stray light available from the laboratory room lights. Note that inside the fluorimeter the sample was partially shielded from the room lights but this latter experiment was interesting as a measure of how rapidly P3HT would degrade under room lighting conditions. Both these are compared to another run using only 532 nm excitation, equivalent to the data in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 3  Normalised rate of emission loss from a P3HT film depending on the intensity of the light source. Emission yield was probed at 532 nm except for the ‘white-light’ case, where the white light itself (light between 410 and 650 nm) was used as the excitation and degradation source. In the ‘white-light’ case the probe wavelength was moved to 700 nm. In the ‘roomlight’ case, room-light intensity varied greatly by orientation in the room however light fluence at the sample position is estimated to be less than 10 μW cm−2. Dashed lines represent a fit of the fluorescence quenching curves to eqn (3) using only the initial 3 or 4 data points. Values for the rate of defect formation, B (cm−3 s−1), are also given. 
Under the more intense ‘white’ light, the P3HT emission signal dropped much more rapidly than under monochromated 532 nm light, with an 80% reduction seen within only two minutes. Meanwhile under the weaker, laboratory room-light illumination, the rate of emission loss was much reduced compared to monochromated 532 nm light, taking four times as long to achieve a 20% drop in emission yield. The intensity of the illumination is therefore limiting the rate of defect formation and is a crucial part of the reaction mechanism.
To see if the fluorescence quenching correlated to a decrease in P3HT excited state lifetime, time-correlated single photon counting studies (TCSPC) as a function of degradation were carried out on a film of P3HT (Fig. 4). The film was degraded for a fixed period in air under a monochromated lamp of 532 nm illumination (100 μW cm−2) before returning to an inert atmosphere for the emissive lifetime measurement. Doing this, the lifetime of the P3HT emission changed from a maximum of 800 ps for the pristine film to 675 ps after 10 minutes, to 570 ps after 30 minutes to around 500 ps after 50 minutes of degradation. As a final step, the film was exposed to the laser source of the single photon counter (∼3.4 mW cm−2: exc. 410 nm) while in air, causing the lifetime to immediately decrease beyond the resolution of the TCPSC system (∼300 ps). A much quicker resolution (∼50 ps) streak camera coupled to a laser has shown analogous results, with a decreasing lifetime upon exposure to air and laser light (exc. 532 nm). Interestingly however, we found that the fluorescent lifetime of P3HT would not decrease indefinitely, instead once the fluorescent lifetime of P3HT had decreased to around 350 ps, it would become stable (see Fig. S1†).
 Fig. 4  Emissive lifetime of a film of P3HT in the pristine condition and after degradation with 532 nm light (100 μW cm−2) for up to 50 min. The inset shows tabulated data for best fits of the decays to a single exponential against degradation time. 
That the fluorescence quenching corresponds to a decrease in emissive lifetime is expected, however that the lifetime of P3HT, even under laser illumination as intense as ∼30 mW cm−2 for several hours in air, becomes apparently ‘stable’ is unusual. On a practical note, the stability of ‘degraded’ P3HT may explain reports in the literature quoting a lifetime of around 400 ps55–57 for P3HT when measured in air but reports of a longer lifetime for P3HT films under inert atmospheres.58
Discussion
Overall we find that P3HT is stable to both air and illumination individually but degradation occurs when exposed simultaneously to light and air. We can model the decrease to the steady-state emission from the film as an increase in quenching by defects using a simple differential model:59 (1)where AIEx represents the formation of singlet states by light absorption, kf and kQ represent the rates of fluorescence decay in the absence of any defect sites and the rate of quenching by defects, [s1] and [Q] are the concentration of singlets and quenching defects respectively. Note that this model will assume uniform illumination of the film throughout its thickness, which as a first approximation is true. Since It and I0, the intensity of fluorescence, were measured in the steady state and Q is thought to be proportional to time (t), eqn (1) becomes: (2)where α is a geometrical factor for fluorescence collection. The rate constant of singlet quenching, kQ, is a term representing the diffusion and reaction of singlets with defect sites and hence can be broken down into parts, where kQ = 4πDR; where D is the diffusion constant of singlets in P3HT and R is the reaction distance. Finally [Q], the concentration of defects, can be broken into two parts, B, the rate of defect formation per volume unit time, and t, time. Although the equation assumes B is constant as a function of time, whether B would be constant depends on the mechanism of defect formation. (3)
Fitting eqn (3) onto the initial quenching data in Fig. 2 we can calculate B by taking D60 as 1 × 10−2 cm2 s−1, R to be 1 nm and from this report we take τf to be 800 ps. The best fit to the initial few data points in Fig. 2 gives a B value, and namely a rate of formation of defect sites, of 1.0 × 1015 cm−3 per min (see ESI, Fig. S1†). The relevance of such a rate is immediately obvious; under the conditions roughly 1 × 1015 defects per cm3 are formed per minute. The current conditions are, however, very specific to the experiment (19 μW: 532 nm) so it serves to generalise this result further. As it is clear that light exposure is necessary to initiate the defect formation, B can be converted to a quantum yield of defect formation per incident photon. Given the total number of photons radiant upon the sample per minute was approximately 3.1 × 1015photons cm−2 min−1 (equivalent to 5.2 × 1020 formed singlet states per cm3 per minute assuming one singlet per photon) the calculated quantum yield for defect formation per incident photon becomes roughly 2 × 10−6 (ca. 1.9 × 10−6). So, for a pristine or near pristine film, only 2 defects are formed for every one million incident photons. As a process, defect product formation is therefore relatively inefficient, however, to put this in context, standard laboratory room lighting has around 1015 visible region photons per cm2 per second above the P3HT bandgap, while sunlight (1 Sun AM 1.5G) has roughly 6 × 1016 above band gap photons per cm2 per second. Despite a quantum efficiency of only 2 × 10−6, the high number of available photons mean natural sunlight would generate 2 × 1016 defects cm−3 in a thin film of P3HT in only a second; while even for typical laboratory lighting conditions, the formation of a similar number of defects would only take a matter of minutes. The formation of defect quenching sites is therefore relatively rapid when considering the usual handling of P3HT in the laboratory.
In calculating experimental error margins, a repeat run at 532 nm (data in Fig. 3) gave a slightly higher quantum yield of 5 × 10−6 defects per incident photon, so the final value of the quantum yield for defect formation per incident photon is (3.5 ± 1.5) × 10−6. The reason for the experimental error is unclear as both runs were meant to be identical. Our largest experimental error is thought to be the spot size of the light source on the film, with an estimated error margin of ±25%. Additional unaccounted for factors, such as the condition of the air (humidity, temperature), may therefore be the cause of all or any additional error. Note that this is an experimental error only and does not include error margins for values used in the calculations of the fitting, such as R or D.
While the quantum yield gives a useful indication for the rate of degradation in pristine P3HT films, there is an additional complication to the P3HT degradation, in that the rate of defect formation appears to be time-dependent. When eqn (3) is used to fit the datasets in Fig. 3 and similar data in Fig. 2, the theory provides a poor fit to the experimental results. In Fig. 3 for instance, the first few initial data points are used to give the fitting (dashed lines) however the films experience much less quenching than theory predicts as time goes by and this is the case regardless of the light intensities incident. Potential experimental reasons for the poor fit to theory such as light-scatter, that might provide an artificial background, or poor air permeation into the P3HT films that might mean only the surface of the films were being degraded, were discounted experimentally. Instead, the most likely cause for the poor fit is that B is not constant with time and is instead time-dependent, or more meaningfully, that it decreases as degradation progresses and quenching sites accumulate (see Fig. S2† for a calculation of the evolution of B with time for the data in Fig. 2).
The reason for the slow-down in degradation is not due to bleaching of the film absorption. In all cases, the film absorption was unchanged by the degradation and so we cannot suppose that fewer photons are being absorbed by the films (see Fig. S3†). Likewise, the supply of reactants in the air in the chamber cannot be rate-limiting as even under weak illumination the self-inhibiting process remains evident (i.e., if there is enough air to support faster emission loss at higher light intensities then there must be excess air available at the lowest light intensity—see Fig. 3). If neither of the reactants, namely photon absorption and air, is causing the rate of defect formation (B) to decrease, then it is likely that the mechanism itself is self-limiting.
The most commonly reported degradation mechanisms, such as ozone or free-radical attack, do not fit this mechanistical picture, as the creation of ozone or free radical formed defects do not depend on the condition of the polymer film (they will depend on external parameters such as the intensity of UV light or the temperature, or condition of the air, all of which remain constant throughout the experiment). Instead other mechanisms, involving the excited state of P3HT, are the most likely degradation routes. A previously reported mechanism for the degradation of PPV polymers, involving attack of the polymer excited state by ground state oxygen, can explain the observed behaviour.47 In this mechanism, the excited state is a central reactant but as the degradation leads to quenching of the excited state lifetime the degradation process inhibits itself.
A proposed scheme of the reaction mechanism is shown in Fig. 5 and is similar to that in ref. 47. Here the P3HT excited state (P3HT*) reacts with a molecule of oxygen (O2) forming a charge-transfer state. The intermediate charge-transfer state then transforms directly into an oxygenated product of P3HT (a defect site) or deactivates returning the P3HT and oxygen to the ground state. As more and more defects appear, the lifetime of the P3HT excited state decreases, leaving fewer excited states available to form charge transfer states. This could explain why the rate of defect formation slows with time and eventually appears to halt altogether (see ESI†).
 Fig. 5  Proposed degradation pathway for P3HT involving attack of the polymer excited state by ground state oxygen from the air. The excited P3HT state (P3HT*) and oxygen collide creating a high energy intermediate charge transfer state (P3HT-O2)* that can then go onward to form an oxygenated degradation product (P3HTO2). As mentioned in ref. 30 singlet oxygen is also photogenerated by P3HT and so this is also considered to be a possible decay pathway of the charge transfer state as is decay back to the ground state P3HT and oxygen. Note that ref. 30 also finds that P3HT is stable with respect to singlet oxygen, and as such no reaction between singlet oxygen and P3HT to give an oxygenated product is expected, as marked in the cycle. 
A precise approximation for the number of defect states in the films of P3HT can be calculated from the time resolved fluorescence results. If indeed, the degradation has finished and the film reached a ‘stable’ state in the streak camera experiment, the observed lifetime could provide an estimate for the number of defects present in the film. Returning to eqn (1), the quenching of fluorescence at defect states (−kq[Q]) should be the dominant term and hence should control the observed fluorescence lifetime (τobs). 1/τobs = kobs ≃ kq[Q](4)As before, kq, the rate of diffusion, is estimated by 4πDR and τobs ≈ 350 ps, giving a value for Q of 2 × 1017 defects cm−3. Hence, at the ‘end’ of the degradation process, the number of defect states in films of P3HT is ∼2 × 1017 defects cm−3. If the film will degrade no further, as the time resolved results suggest, then this should act as an upper limit to the number of defects formed in the film.
The formation of singlet oxygen is potentially another degradation pathway for P3HT that involves originally the P3HT excited state. Manceau et al. (ref. 30) have shown that illuminated P3HT, like many organic chromophores, is indeed a generator of singlet oxygen. In the same publication however, Manceau et al. demonstrated that singlet oxygen is very unreactive with polythiophene, as has been suggested elsewhere,40 hence singlet oxygen is not thought to go on to react to form an oxygenated defect state with P3HT, as marked out in the scheme. The most likely route for oxygenated defect formation therefore is by direct conversion from the charge transfer intermediate state.
Characterisation of the degradation products would give some further insight into the pathway of attack. We hoped to be able to characterise the degradation products by FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), a commonly used optical method for functional group analysis. However, despite attempts to maximise any potential signal (i.e., optically thick films and 1 sun irradiance for several tens of minutes), the density of defect products proved to be too low to be detected (see Fig. S4† for FTIR data). Although FTIR did not allow characterisation of any defect state(s), this at least does confirm that the number of defect states in the P3HT film should be below the detection limit. Assuming practical limits in detection of the FTIR of 0.2%, an extinction co-efficient on the order of 1000 M−1 cm−1 for the defect and an effective film optical thickness of 1 micron, this corresponds to an approximate detection limit of roughly 5 × 1018 species cm−3. We estimate therefore that the number of defects in P3HT films is less than 5 × 1018 species cm−3 in accord with an upper limit of ∼2 × 1017 defects cm−3 set by the streak camera results.
While other studies have previously observed fluorescence quenching in P3HT,34,38 this is the first study to quantify such a degradation. Our results show that significant degradation can occur in a matter of seconds even under relatively weak illumination in air, and hence, devices or measurements made with films of P3HT will be very sensitive to fabrication conditions. Other degradation studies to date have primarily focussed on studying P3HT degradation over much longer times (hours) and under much stronger light intensity conditions, mostly because they have been monitoring P3HT degradation by changes to ground-state absorption or by FTIR that requires much longer and intense illumination conditions before any changes can be observed.29,35,39 These ‘harsh’ conditions may have given an impression that P3HT is robust to light exposure in air under milder conditions whereas in fact our results clearly show the opposite.
These longer timescale studies also support a different degradation mechanism to the excited state mechanism we propose here, a mechanism involving free-radical attack.24,35,36,38,41 We find the evidence for a free-radical mechanism to be compelling, but this in no way contradicts our assessment of an excited-state led degradation mechanism being responsible for the degradation observed in this study. We suggest that the two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive but instead are happening simultaneously, with the dominant mechanism observed depending on experimental conditions. More so, the presence of other degradation mechanisms for P3HT is important, if, as the data above suggest, the excited state mechanism inhibits itself until it stops altogether, then another mechanism would be necessary to continue degradation of P3HT to completion as observed in the literature.
Implication for electronic devices
Finally, we address briefly what effect the above excited-state degradation may have on the behaviour of P3HT devices. To consider initially the manufacture and storage, P3HT has proven to be light and air sensitive and hence should be fabricated with care to exclude one of these factors during manufacture. To avoid degradation during storage, P3HT should be stored in a darkened container. Furthermore, to avoid any potential thermo-oxidation,24,61,62P3HT should be stored preferably also under inert atmosphere. Note that during purification of P3HT by fractionation into different solvents, due to the inclusion of the polarising oxygen atom, the oxidised products of P3HT are more likely to appear in the ethyl-ether or methanol fraction, and so this fraction is likely to be less pure than other fractions.
Field-effect-transistors (FETs) are typically operated in the dark and therefore the active material should be stable to the above mechanism of degradation in air, at least if kept completely in the dark. Even if light exposure in air cannot be avoided for FET devices, as the formation of degradation sites in P3HT is self-limiting, there should be only limited trap-state formation. As explained above, the estimated maximum number of defect sites (traps) formed from air and light exposure by the above mechanism in P3HT will be around 2 × 1017 cm−3 (inferred from time-resolved emission results). As 1017 cm−3 traps are less than the number of charges present at the dielectric interface when the device is under accumulation (typically 1018 cm−3) there should be no large difference to the ‘on’ performance of the device. On/off current ratios however, would be expected to become worse with degradation, with the presence of persistent carriers in trap sites causing an increase in conductivity in the ‘off’ state. On the other hand, charge mobility measurements involving injection of charges into P3HT may be limited by space-charge limited current (SCLC) to around 1016 injected carriers per cm3. This is within the proposed defect limit, and so mobility measurements will be significantly affected by the degree of film degradation (trap formation). Interestingly, deeper consideration reveals that FET response to light exposure in air may also be a factor of film optical depth. As the working part of the FET is the immediate few nm's of material next to the dielectric, with a thick film of material, light would effectively be screened from reaching the bottom part of the film. Hence while the top layer would become oxidised, the critical active few nanometres at the bottom would be dark and protected from degradation and the device performance unchanged.
For light-emitting-diodes (LEDs) regioregular P3HT is not commonly used because of its low fluorescence quantum yield,57 however polythiophene derivatives63 and thiophene rings are common parts in polymer emitters for OLEDs. Therefore knowledge of polythiophene degradation may also hold true for these chemically similar polymers. Although OLEDs do not absorb light they do act as generators of excited states, and this would make them susceptible to the above mechanism of degradation. Operation in the presence of air would quickly lead to irreversible oxygenation and eventual formation of quenching sites for future emission, a problem compounded by the oxygenation targeting specifically the emitters. For OLED's air-blocking layers would then appear necessary and in practice this is the case.6
By design solar cells are exposed to light and hence would at first glance appear to be susceptible to the above mechanism of degradation. However, the ultrafast quenching of the P3HT singlet state by PCBM means that the singlet excited state will have only a very short effective lifetime (less than a few ps) and therefore PCBM will out-compete molecular oxygen to quench the singlet state. Surprisingly therefore, a blend film of P3HT and PCBM could be stable to illumination in air, at least to the above mechanism of degradation.64–68 This is in accord with reports that polymer:fullerene blend films are more stable than films of the polymer alone. This is encouraging with respect to commercialisation of organic solar cells, as fabrication completely under inert atmospheres may not be necessary. One concern however, is the effect of air on the PCBM component, and this still needs to be considered.48
Conclusions
In conclusion, we find that films of regioregular P3HT are stable to air and stable to UV or VIS illumination individually, but that degradation occurs immediately upon exposure to illumination in air. The quantum yield of defect product formation per incident photon (532 nm) in air was calculated to be 3.5 × 10−6 (±1.5 × 10−6) for a pristine film of P3HT. The degradation mechanism is thought to proceed by attack of ground state molecular oxygen (O2) on the polymer excited state. An ever decreasing rate of defect formation and eventual stability of the P3HT fluorescence lifetime to testing in air suggests the reaction is self-inhibiting after a certain amount of degradation, presumably due to defect quenching of the excited state lifetime. At this point the film becomes ‘quasi-stable’ and will no longer degrade following the above mechanism when illuminated in air. As a result, a tentative maximum possible number of defects that can be formed in films of P3HTvia this mechanism is estimated at 2 × 1017 defects per cm3. While the number of defects is limited, 2 × 1017 defects cm−3 is sufficient to have an impact on the operation of FET, OLED and OSC devices.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Emission yield from a film of P3HT following a period of light irradiation at 266 nm under vacuum, 532 nm under vacuum, and then a period of exposure to air in the dark. Note the immediate small dip in emissive yield upon changing from vacuum to air is likely due to changes in refractive index of the medium and hence a small change in the emission pathway.	 

 	Fig. 2  Emission yield from a film of P3HT under different conditions (i) under illumination with 532 nm light in air (19 μW cm−2); (ii) a ‘recovery’ period of 3 hours under dark and vacuum; (iii) under illumination in a vacuum; and (iv) back under illumination in air. Note the changes to the scaling of the x-axis. Defect density was calculated with eqn (3).	 

 	Fig. 3  Normalised rate of emission loss from a P3HT film depending on the intensity of the light source. Emission yield was probed at 532 nm except for the ‘white-light’ case, where the white light itself (light between 410 and 650 nm) was used as the excitation and degradation source. In the ‘white-light’ case the probe wavelength was moved to 700 nm. In the ‘roomlight’ case, room-light intensity varied greatly by orientation in the room however light fluence at the sample position is estimated to be less than 10 μW cm−2. Dashed lines represent a fit of the fluorescence quenching curves to eqn (3) using only the initial 3 or 4 data points. Values for the rate of defect formation, B (cm−3 s−1), are also given.	 

 	Fig. 4  Emissive lifetime of a film of P3HT in the pristine condition and after degradation with 532 nm light (100 μW cm−2) for up to 50 min. The inset shows tabulated data for best fits of the decays to a single exponential against degradation time.

 	Fig. 5  Proposed degradation pathway for P3HT involving attack of the polymer excited state by ground state oxygen from the air. The excited P3HT state (P3HT*) and oxygen collide creating a high energy intermediate charge transfer state (P3HT-O2)* that can then go onward to form an oxygenated degradation product (P3HTO2). As mentioned in ref. 30 singlet oxygen is also photogenerated by P3HT and so this is also considered to be a possible decay pathway of the charge transfer state as is decay back to the ground state P3HT and oxygen. Note that ref. 30 also finds that P3HT is stable with respect to singlet oxygen, and as such no reaction between singlet oxygen and P3HT to give an oxygenated product is expected, as marked in the cycle.
