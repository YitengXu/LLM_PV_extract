    , Accepted 15th December 2016First published on 20th December 2016AbstractTo date, all the lead halide based full-inorganic or organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have been synthesized from organic solvent, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), by a solution method. Herein, water has been utilized as a ‘green’ solvent to develop an efficient synthetic route to grow various kinds of lead halide perovskite nanowires (NWs). By controlling the proportion of the hybrid cations, Csx(CH3NH3)1−xPbI3 perovskite NWs were successfully synthesized. Every Csx(CH3NH3)1−xPbI3 perovskite NW demonstrated single crystal characteristics with uniform stoichiometric element distribution. Because of the controllable cation composition, the NW bandgaps could be finely tuned from 1.5 to 1.7 eV. Transient photoluminescence spectra showed superior NW quality when compared with those of the conventional DMF-based NWs. Based on the abovementioned high quality single Cs0.5(CH3NH3)0.5PbI3 perovskite NW, a reliable single-NW photodetector was fabricated to investigate the optoelectronic application. It demonstrated a responsivity of 23 A/W, exceeding most of the reported values in the perovskite nanowire photoconductive detectors, and the shot-noise normalized detectivity was 2.5 × 1011 Jones comparable to the parameters of the commercial silicon-based nanowires. The green and robust synthesis method, finely tunable NW bandgaps, and superior optoelectronic properties are expected to open a new door for the development of perovskite optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Organo-lead halide perovskite (OHP, CH3NH3PbX3) has been widely applied in optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells,1–3 light-emitting devices (LEDs),4 field-effect transistors (FETs),5 photodetectors (PDs),6–8 and lasers,9 due to its remarkable photoelectric properties. For optoelectronic applications, the absorption band edge and peak position play key roles in the device performance.3–9 Hybrid perovskites have attracted significant interest due to their tunable bandgaps and superior energy conversion properties. The bandgap tuning is generally implemented by changing the composition by halogen anion10–14 or cation15–17 exchange. Recently, Li et al. utilized FA0.81MA0.15PbI2.51Br0.45 as an organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite, which not only realized the tunable bandgaps but also improved the device performance compared to that of their counterparts alone.18
Nowadays, the synthesis methods of perovskite NWs are ascribed to solvent evaporation assisted self-assembly methods19–24 and most reports utilized organic polar solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), in a solution method. The low-cost and large-scale perovskite optoelectronic devices, especially for solar cells, would consume large amounts of organic solvent, which is not only harmful to the operators but is also non-environmentally friendly. Once the organic solvent is replaced by water, it is of great benefit for the future of perovskite development. Inspired by the abovementioned considerations, we investigated the utilization of water as a solvent to synthesize the perovskite materials.
Different perovskite morphologies and structures, including nanoparticles,25 NW,19–21 nanosheets26 and quantum dots,11 have been realized by various synthesis routes. The perovskite NWs hold well-defined crystal structure and a novel one-dimensional enclosing surface,27,28 which offers fewer grain boundaries, lower defect concentration, and longer photocarrier lifetime.29,30 Recently, most groups have fabricated single cation perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) NWs by solvent evaporation assisted self-assembly methods.27,28,30 In contrast, hybrid cation perovskite NWs with fine tuning bandgaps were expected to match better to the light emission or absorption spectra. Furthermore, the reported perovskite photodetectors (PDs) based on NWs and microwires (MWs) were all based on groups of them (hundreds of NWs) rather than a single NW, which may lead to the deviation from the NW's original properties. In this regard, single NW-based photodetectors were systematically investigated to understand their intrinsic physical properties, especially their photocarrier behavior, which is the basis of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.
Here, we developed an aqueous solution method for Csx(CH3NH3)1−xPbI3 perovskite NWs. By tuning the hybrid cation ratio, Csx(CH3NH3)1−xPbI3 perovskite NWs with finely tunable bandgaps were realised. Single NW photodetectors with a single crystalline nature demonstrated high detection performance. The ‘green’ solvent utilization, tunable NW bandgaps and high performance optoelectronic devices in the present work are expected to introduce new elements into perovskite research.
2. Results and discussion
It was well known that the polar solvent water could dissolve perovskite materials. Thus, it is a possibility to apply it in perovskite synthesis in order to avoid consuming organic solvent. The aqueous solution method for perovskite NWs mainly contained two parts, as shown in Fig. 1a–f. One part was the preparation of PbI2 flakes in saturated aqueous solution (Fig. 1a–c). Excessive PbI2 powder was dissolved in water at 75 °C as the starting precursor solution (Fig. 1b). Once the solution was cooled to room temperature (∼25 °C) the flashing PbI2 flakes could separate out from the oversaturated solution (Fig. 1c). The other part was the growth of perovskite NWs as shown in Fig. 1d–f. The obtained supernatant was added with cation sources (Fig. 1d). By simply shaking for few seconds, the transparent solution became light grey (Fig. 1e). Then the newly grown porous grey materials were immediately filtrated and baked to remove residual water (Fig. 1f). The detailed process was described in the experiment section.

(b) The precursor was heated to 75 °C for 30 min to get PbI2 saturated aqueous solution. (c) Transfer supernatant (about 10 mL) to another bottle and cool to room temperature (∼25 °C). PbI2 flake separated out from the solution. (d) Add CsI, CH3NH3I or a mixture of them into the PbI2 aqueous solution. (e) The perovskite NWs settled after violent shaking for 1 minute. (f) Suction filtration and baking process to obtain perovskite NWs. 
PbI2 flakes were obtained by recrystallization process (Fig. S1a and 1c, ESI†). The synthesized PbI2 flakes could easily react with CsI or CH3NH3I due to ultra-high surface area and high solubility of cation sources, and then be converted into perovskite molecules in solution. These molecules freely reacted with each other to grow into perovskite NWs or NW-like intermediate materials by oriented self-assembly method in aqueous solution. Excess CsI and MAI were added into the solution to enable the complete reaction with PbI2 flakes. For NW growth, the yellow CsPbI3 NWs could directly grow in aqueous solution, while the CH3NH3PbI3 NWs first existed in the form of precursor NWs (Fig. S1a†). After suction filtration and drying, the white precursor NWs would convert into black CH3NH3PbI3 NWs. The amount of perovskite NWs obtained by this method depended on the mass of PbI2 separated out from aqueous solution. The temperature dependent solubility of PbI2 in aqueous solution was shown in Fig. S1b.† We could get ∼9.7 mg PbI2 flakes in 1 mL water when the temperature decreased from 75 °C to 25 °C. Therefore, one milliliter PbI2 saturated solution could contain 13.1 mg CH3NH3PbI3 or 14.7 mg CsPbI3 NWs. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of these perovskite NWs were shown in Fig. S1d† and all peak positions were coincident with standard ones of CsPbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite.15
And in our previous report,19,34 the growth direction of CH3NH3PbI3 NWs is [001]; the XRD pattern in Fig. S1d† further confirmed their [001] preferential growth direction.19,20 From the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the Cs0.5(CH3NH3)0.5PbI3 nanowire (inset of Fig. S3h†), the interplanar spacing verified the [001] growth direction, and the SAED pattern of CsPbI3 proves that the growth direction is [001] also.
In addition to the single cation perovskite NWs, hybrid cation perovskite materials have obtained the highest state-of-the-art conversion efficiency in solar cells and light emitting diodes, ascribed to their superior optoelectronic properties.1–4,18 In this regard, three kinds of perovskite NWs (CsPbI3, CH3NH3PbI3, Cs0.5(CH3NH3)0.5PbI3) were conveniently implemented by addition of the corresponding cation sources. The optical microscope pictures of perovskite NWs in water were shown in Fig. 2a–c. It was obvious that all the perovskite molecules grew into NWs in aqueous solution. The products in Fig. 2a–c looked like floccules consisting of numerous thin and short NWs. However, the pure CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite NWs in Fig. 2b tended to grow larger diameter NWs of hundreds of microns in length due to the larger molecular volume31,32 and stronger orientation growth. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of three perovskites dispersed on SiO2 substrate were shown in Fig. 2d–f. All obtained NWs were clean and smooth from the present aqueous synthetic route. The diameters of CsPbI3, CH3NH3PbI3 and hybrid perovskite NWs were about 300 nm, 1200 nm, 300 nm extracted from their corresponding insets in the single NW SEM images. The above pure NW growth highly depended on PbI2 flakes. We could only get short nanorods or non-uniform particles (Fig. S1f†) by utilizing PbI2 powder as a precursor. It was noted that the present aqueous solution method grew the NWs in aqueous solution rather than the reported solvent evaporation-driven method26 and it was expected that such natural growth could yield high quality perovskite NWs.

(d–f) Perovskite SEM morphologies from CsPbI3 (d), CH3NH3PbI3 (e), and Cs0.5(CH3NH3)0.5PbI3 (f) perovskite NWs after drying. The insets are high resolution SEM images for the corresponding single NWs. 
Further characterizations were carried out to probe the composition and quality of single perovskite NW, as shown in Fig. 3. Although the NWs held different cations, they inherited the same crystal structure of a regular octahedron unit cell which was schematically described in Fig. 3a. For hybrid Csx(CH3NH3)1−xPbI3 perovskite NW, it could be conveniently implemented by adding a mixture of cation sources with the required molar ratio. Single NW of one typical cation ratio (1:1, Cs0.5(CH3NH3)0.5PbI3) was scanned by atomic force microscope (AFM) as shown in Fig. 3b and c. This revealed the cylinder-like morphology and smooth surface along the whole length with a diameter of 300 nm. In addition to the NW morphologies, the composition of hybrid perovskite NW was another matter of concern. Fig. 3d schematically showed the growth process when equimolar amounts of CsI and CH3NH3I were added into PbI2 aqueous solution. CsI and CH3NH3I molecules first reacted with PbI2 nanoflakes (Part I) and generate their own molecules, respectively (Part II). Then the two kinds of perovskite molecules would freely self-assemble along their preferential orientations to grow into NWs (Part III). These obtained Cs0.5(CH3NH3)0.5PbI3 NWs showed pure features without any secondary phases, such as CsPbI3, CH3NH3PbI3, and so on. The single phase product was characterized by its photoluminescence (PL) spectrum in Fig. 3f. The corresponding four tested regions marked as A–D was shown in Fig. 3e. Region A and B probed in one NW had the identical peak position at 729 nm, and the others from different NWs had little difference in the peak center shift (within 5 nm).

In order to explore the compositions of a single NW, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) were utilized to characterize the obtained NWs. The Cs0.5(CH3NH3)0.5PbI3 NW showed a clear and round surface (from Fig. 3g). The ordered diffraction spots from the selected area (inset) could infer the single crystal nature of the synthesized NWs. Moreover, except for the element Cu from the copper screen and C from the carbon membranes, all the characteristic elements, such as Cs, N, Pb and I, were obtained in Fig. S2f.† Similarly, the compositions of pure CsPbI3 NW and CH3NH3PbI3 NW measured by TEM and EDS were shown in Fig. S2a–d,† and the ratios of related elements coincided with stoichiometric quantities listed in Table 1. However, the element ratio of pure CH3NH3PbI3 NW was lacking in nitrogen. That may be ascribed to the strong electron beam illumination in the TEM, which would decompose CH3NH3PbI3 in a short time. As shown in Fig. S3,† three kinds of NWs were irradiated by the electron beam with the energy of 200 keV for 3 min. The all-inorganic CsPbI3 NWs had little change but the CH3NH3PbI3 NWs seriously decomposed. Compared with organo-lead triiodide perovskite material (CH3NH3PbI3), the hybrid perovskite materials by cation exchange could greatly improve the electron beam illumination stability. The present aqueous-grown CH3NH3PbI3 NWs were also compared with conventional DMF-based NWs. Fig. 3h showed the transient photoluminescence decay of perovskite NWs from the above two methods. The aqueous method demonstrated photocarrier lifetime one order greater than conventional DMF-based method, which confirmed the superior NW quality of the newly developed aqueous method.

It was interesting that the bandgaps of hybrid perovskite NWs could be easily tuned from CH3NH3PbI3 (1.5 eV) to CsPbI3 (1.72 eV). It was expected that the bandgaps of Csx(CH3NH3)1−xPbI3 NWs would consecutively change with corresponding composition. The x value depended markedly on the molar ratio of CsI and CH3NH3I added in solution. The fine tuning of the absorption of hybrid perovskite NWs with different proportions was shown in Fig. 4a. The UV-Vis absorption spectra showed a blue shift as the x value increased. According to the Tauc formula (αhν)2 = c(hν − Eg), the relationship between (αhν)2 and (hν) was shown in Fig. 4b. The bandgaps obtained from linear fitting agreed well with corresponding cation perovskite. When CsI and CH3NH3I were equimolar, the perovskite NW bandgap was about 1.6 eV. Similarly, the PL spectrum peak positions of Csx(CH3NH3)1−xPbI3 perovskite NWs were accurately controlled by the added ingredients. As shown in Fig. 4c and d, normalized PL spectra were plotted for five demonstrations. With the increase of element Cs content, the PL peak positions were linearly dependent on x values (Fig. 4d). Csx(CH3NH3)1−xPbI3 NWs with finely tunable bandgaps and emission wavelengths would play important roles in lasers, solar cells, photodetectors, and so on.3–5

(d) The PL peak positions were linearly tuned by x values for Csx(CH3NH3)1−xPbI3 perovskite NWs. 
The high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and carrier transport mobility of perovskite NWs promise great potential applications in photodetectors (PDs). The previous work utilized groups of NWs to detect light source rather than a single NW, which maybe suffered from reported NW quality, and the high resistance led to thermal degradation.33 The present freely-grown NWs and inorganic cation incorporation was expected to realise single NW-based PDs. Single NW PDs attracted more attention due to the special superiorities such as small size, high performance and low cost.34 To test the photoelectric properties of hybrid perovskite materials, the single NW PDs were fabricated with Cs0.5(CH3NH3)0.5PbI3 perovskite NWs. The schematic diagram of single NW device structure was drawn in Fig. 5a. Once the device was irradiated by a light source, the photo-generated carriers were rapidly separated and collected by electrodes under the applied electric field. As shown in Fig. 5b, the active channel length of the device was 10 μm and the diameter was about 300 nm. Fig. 5c showed I–V curves under different intensities of light illumination from 0 to 4.5 mW. The light power at milliwatt levels could be detected and distinguished clearly. From the I–t curves in Fig. 5d, the sequential PD response to the switching off of the light was stable and abrupt. The extracted photocurrent and dark current were ∼1.2 nA and ∼0.3 nA, respectively. The relationship between photocurrent and light power density was shown in Fig. 5e. It exerted a linear relationship under weak power densities (less than 2 mW cm−2) and tended to saturation under stronger illumination. From these tests, the single hybrid perovskite NW PD could realize a superior detecting performance for visible light. In addition, responsivity (R) and normalized detectivity (D*) are two key parameters to compare the performances of different devices. Responsivity was calculated by R = (Ip − Id)/PA; and shot-noise derived normalized detectivity can be calculated by , where Ip is photocurrent, Id is dark current, P denotes light power density and A is the device area, q represents elementary charge. According to the above formulae, responsivity and normalized detectivity presented similar evolution trends with bias voltage as shown in Fig. 5f. The maximum responsivity could reach up to 23 A/W under the bias voltage of 5 V, which was the state-of-the-art top level of reported perovskite photoconductive detectors20–22,36 (Table S1†). By increasing the voltage bias, the normalized detectivity increased and gradually saturated to a stable value of 2.5 × 1011 Jones. EQE is expressed by the relationship: EQE = hcR/eλ35, where h is Planck's constant, c is the velocity of light, R is responsivity, e is the electronic charge and λ is the exciting wavelength. The EQE of Cs0.5(CH3NH3)0.5PbI3 single-NW photodetector was calculated to be 5.4 × 103% at 530 nm.

3. Conclusion
An efficient synthetic route to grow full-inorganic and hybrid cation perovskite single crystal NWs was successfully implemented by a new aqueous solution method. By controlling the proportion of CsI and CH3NH3I, Csx(CH3NH3)1−xPbI3 perovskite NWs successfully grew in water. The obtained Csx(CH3NH3)1−xPbI3 perovskite NW was single crystal in nature and their compositions was consistent with their corresponding stoichiometric quantities. Transient photoluminescence demonstrated the extension of photocarrier lifetime by one order when obtained from the present aqueous method. By changing the cation ratios, the bandgaps could be finely tuned from 1.5 to 1.72 eV. Furthermore, a stable and reliable PD based on single Cs0.5(CH3NH3)0.5PbI3 perovskite NW was fabricated with responsivity of 23 A/W and stable normalized detectivity of 2.5 × 1011 Jones. The present green and robust tuning method combining with high performances of hybrid Csx(CH3NH3)1−xPbI3 perovskite photodetectors are expected to support a powerful platform for the development of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.
4. Experimental section
Material preparation
All the materials, such as CsI, PbI2, methylamine alcohol solution and hydroiodic acid, were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd and used without further purification. Methylamine iodide (CH3NH3I) was synthesized according to a previous study.1,2
Perovskite NW growth
Excessive PbI2 powder was added into 20 mL water. Then it was heated to 75 °C in aqueous bath for 30 min to get PbI2 saturated aqueous solution. After that, the supernatant (about 10 mL) was transferred to another beaker and cooled to room temperature and the PbI2 flakes were separated out. For NW growth, CsI and CH3NH3I with set molar ratio were added into the above PbI2 flake solution and it was violently shaken for a few times. After a short growth time (within 1 minute), the corresponding perovskite NWs would deposit at the bottom. Finally, we used suction filtration for 5 min to remove the water quickly and baked the NWs for 30 min at 90 °C. Numerous NWs were synthesized and stored for ready use.
Material characterization
The optical and structural characterizations were performed on UV-Vis absorption (Cary, Lambda 950) and X-ray diffraction spectra (XRD, XRD-7000S/L). The prepared perovskite NW morphologies and crystal structure were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Nova NanoSEM 450) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G20). The NW surface morphologies and emission properties were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM, SPM9700) and photoluminescence (PL, LabRAM HR800).
Device fabrication and measurements
The Cs0.5(CH3NH3)0.5PbI3 perovskite NWs were homogeneously dispersed in aqueous solution and uniformly deposited on SiO2 substrate by drop-coating method. Assisted with shadow mask, ordered Au electrodes were fabricated on NWs by thermal evaporation. The active channel containing a single NW was 10 μm in length and 300 nm in diameter. Photodetector performance was measured by Agilent B1500A semiconductor characterization system assisted with a probe station. The irradiation was generated from monochromatic light-emitting diodes (530 nm) controlled by a functional generator (Agilent 33210A). Light intensity was calibrated by a silicon optical power meter (Newport 818-UV).
