    , Accepted 15th November 2018First published on 19th November 2018AbstractUltrathin layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets are a promising candidate as the electrode material for energy storage due to the ultrafast mass diffusion and greater specific surface area. As a kind of emerging electrode material, metal nitride plays a vital role in improving the poor conductivity of most supercapacitors. Herein, we design a novel three-dimensional (3D) embedded hierarchical core–shell nanostructure by combining ultrathin CoFe-LDH nanosheets (∼2.5 nm) with porous Cu3N nanowire arrays (NWAs), in which the ultrathin CoFe-LDH nanosheets are grown from the interior of Cu3N nanowire cores supported on Cu foam (denoted as Cu3N@CoFe-LDH). The prepared Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWA electrode exhibits a high areal capacitance of 3078 mF cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2, excellent rate capacity (85.8% capacity retention at 20 mA cm−2) and superior cycling stability (93.9% retention after 10000 cycles), making it significantly superior to the related CuO@CoFe-LDH NWA electrodes. Additionally, the constructed asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) devices deliver an ultrahigh energy density of 2.474 mWh cm−3 and a robust cycling stability (92.6% retention after 10000 cycles). The outstanding electrochemical performance can be credited to the significant enhancement of the specific surface area, charge transport, and mechanical stability by the ultrathin LDH shell, the highly conductive Cu3N core, and the distinctive embedded core–shell nanostructure.
1. Introduction
In light of the sharp increase in the consumption of fossil fuels globally and the growing environmental pollution problem, there is an urgent demand for clean, efficient, and renewable energy resources. Certainly, sustainable electrochemical energy storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors (also called electrochemical capacitors), have become the critical components for full utilization of the green and renewable but intermittent conventional energy sources such as solar, wind and tide.1–4 Among various electrochemical energy storage devices, supercapacitors have shown extraordinary prospects for application in hybrid electric vehicles, portable electronic devices and communication in recent years by the inherent virtue of high power density, rapid charge–discharge, and long cycle life.5–7 Based on the type of charge-storage mechanism, supercapacitors are further classified into electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors. Compared with electric double-layer capacitors, pseudocapacitors show enhanced energy density by introducing a continuous and reversible redox (faradaic) reaction on the electrode surface.8,9 Additionally, pseudocapacitors generally combine non-faradaic electrostatic charge storage (electric double-layer) with redox reactions to get larger capacitance.10–13 As a kind of emerging pseudocapacitive electrode material, transition metal nitrides or carbides that are superior to metal oxides in terms of electrical conductivity (4000–55500 S cm−1) have successfully drawn plenty of attention from researchers in recent years.10,11,14 So far, there have been a lot of efforts devoted to investigating pseudocapacitive transition metal nitrides, including TiN,15,16 VN,17 and Fe2N.18,19
Cu based materials have drawn particular attention as promising pseudocapacitive electrode materials due to their unique physicochemical properties, low cost, abundance, easy preparation, and environmental friendliness.20–22 Especially, CuO and Cu2O with nanostructure arrays such as nanowires,23,24 nanorods25,26 and nanosheets27,28 have fast mass transfer and high structural stability as electrode materials. Unfortunately, their poor electrical conductivity and inferior rate capability limit their widespread commercial application.10,29 On the other hand, the limited specific surface area of nanostructure arrays further influences their electrochemical performance. Therefore, an appropriate design to improve the electrical conductivity of Cu-based materials and enhance the specific surface area with more active sites will be vital for pseudocapacitive materials. Cu3N is a cubic semiconductor material with an anti-ReO3 crystalline structure that is attracting increasing interest for application in multiple areas.14,30 Due to possessing the merits of superior electrical conductivity and structural stability compared with Cu-based oxides, Cu3N is expected to be the most promising pseudocapacitive electrode material. However, few reports on Cu3N-based materials as pseudocapacitive electrode materials are available. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which are composed of positively charged brucite-like host layers and charge compensating interlayer anions, have been used as promising candidates in electrochemical energy storage/conversion owing to their tunable chemical composition, cost effectiveness and environmentally friendly properties.31–34 Among them, Co–Fe LDH as an electrode material has been drawing more and more attention, because the co-existence of Co and Fe ions in the host layers can provide abundant redox reactions due to their combined contributions during the electrochemical processes.35 The CoFe-LDH with the nanosheet structure shows remarkably higher energy density through multiple faradaic (redox) reactions owing to the high specific surface area and ultrathin thickness.36–38
Rational design of the electrode architecture is a powerful method to promote the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. Typically, 3D hierarchical core–shell nanostructures grown on conductive substrates are of great interest due to their large surface area, efficient electron transfer, and intimate access to the electrolyte.39 Li et al. reported hierarchical CuO@CoFe-LDH core–shell NWAs supported on Cu wire as a self-standing electrode for pseudocapacitors.24 Compared with a CuO metal oxide core, Cu3N NWs are much more conductive and have a stable structure. Thus, we propose a novel 3D hierarchical composite nanostructure of Cu3N@CoFe-LDH core–shell NWAs, in which the inner porous Cu3N cores not only serve as highly conductive layers to provide reliable electron transport but also contribute partial capacitance as an electrode material, and ultrathin CoFe-LDH nanosheets (NSs) are used as a shell framework embedded in the Cu3N NWA interior to enhance the specific surface area and the stability of the whole structure. The synthesis process of Cu3N@CoFe-LDH core–shell NWAs supported on a Cu foam substrate is illustrated in Scheme 1. We can see that these 3D embedded Cu3N@CoFe-LDH core–shell NWAs possess better mechanical integrity since the Cu3N NWs are directly grown on the Cu foam, and the CoFe-LDH shell is firmly embedded in the interior of the Cu3N NWA core, ensuring good electronic transport. Additionally, the ultrathin CoFe-LDH NSs were vertically interlaced and distributed on the Cu3N NWAs, leaving lots of active sites and accelerating the diffusion of the electrolyte. Clearly, the 3D embedded core–shell nanostructures can provide large surface area with increased exposure of active sites, efficient electron transport from the inner Cu3N core to the surrounding CoFe-LDH shell, and stable mechanical architecture of the whole 3D core–shell system. Consequently, the as-obtained Cu3N@CoFe-LDH core–shell NWA electrode displays outstanding electrochemical performance with high areal capacitance (3078 mF cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2), superior rate capability and longer cycling lifespans. Finally, a flexible asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated and it exhibited admirable areal energy density and cycling stability.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of the Cu(OH)2 and Cu3N NWAs
The Cu3N NWAs were synthesized by two simple steps. Firstly, precursor Cu(OH)2 NWAs were prepared by a typical alkaline corrosion method.40 Then, a piece of high-purity Cu foam (1 × 1 cm2) was pretreated with 2 M HCl solution, acetone, and absolute ethanol (each for 20 min) by ultrasonication, respectively, to ensure a clean surface. An alkaline oxidative etchant solution (AOES) was prepared by dissolving 1.826 g (NH4)2S2O8 in 44 mL deionized water (0.182 M) and mixing with 16 mL freshly prepared NaOH solution (10 M). Then the Cu foam was immersed into the above solution mixture. After 10 min, a light blue film, precursor Cu(OH)2 NWAs, appeared on the Cu foam surface; it was taken out from the solution, thoroughly rinsed with deionized water and dried in air. Subsequently, Cu3N NWAs on Cu foam were formed by annealing Cu(OH)2 NWAs at 350 °C for 2 h in a flow of NH3. For comparison, CuO NWAs on Cu foam were also fabricated by annealing Cu(OH)2 NWAs at 180 °C for 2 h in air. The mass loading of Cu3N NWAs on Cu foam was calculated to be about 1.04 mg per square centimetre by weighing the sample before and after HCl solution corrosion.
2.2 Synthesis of the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH core–shell NWAs
The Cu3N@CoFe-LDH core–shell NWAs were fabricated by a facile electrodeposition method. In a three-electrode configuration, the Cu foam supported Cu3N NWAs were used as the working electrode, Pt foil was used as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode. A 50 mL solution mixture of FeSO4·7H2O (0.05 M) and Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.05 M) was used as the electrolyte for electrodeposition of the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH core–shell structure. The potentiostatic deposition was carried out at a potential of −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl at room temperature (25 °C), and the deposition time was in the range of 0–200 s. Subsequently, the Cu supported Cu3N@CoFe-LDH core–shell NWAs were taken out and rinsed with distilled water. The mass loading of the Co–Fe LDH was determined by weighing the sample before and after coating.
2.3 Preparation of the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWAs//AC asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device
A dip-coating method was used to synthesize the AC electrode. Typically, active carbon, acetylene black, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were mixed with ethanol in a mass ratio of 8:1:1 to produce a slurry. Acetylene black and PVDF were used as a conductive agent and binder, respectively. The resulting mixture was then painted onto the surface of a nickel foam substrate. Lastly, the manufactured electrodes were dried at 60 °C for 8 h in a vacuum drying oven. The mass-loading of the electrode material was controlled by repeating the above deposition process for several cycles. The Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWAs//AC ASC device (1 × 1 × 0.1 cm3) was fabricated by assembly of a thin PE filter (thickness: 150 μm, Japan) membrane between the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWA positive electrode and the AC negative electrode face-to-face, followed by combination with 2 M KOH as the electrolyte and encapsulation with Kapton plastic film.
2.4 Materials characterization
The crystal structure information of these samples was obtained by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, PANalytical X′ PertPRO) and Raman spectrometry (LabRAM HR JY-Evolution, 532 nm). The morphological characterization was done by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOLJSM-6700F) with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV, combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) for elemental identification. The analysis of elements and valence states was done by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, EscaLab 250Xi). The microstructural characterization was done by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and images were recorded with Philips Tecnai 20 and JEOL JEM-2010 high-resolution transmission electron microscopes.
2.5 Electrochemical performance measurements
For the single electrode test, the electrochemical performance was evaluated on a CorrTest Electrochemical workstation (CHI660E) in a three-electrode system using a 2 M KOH solution as an electrolyte at room temperature. The Cu foam supported Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWAs (Cu3N mass: ∼1.04 mg, CoFe-LDH mass: ∼1.76 mg) served as the working electrode, and Pt foam and an Ag/AgCl electrode served as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The distance between the working electrode and the counter electrode was 2 cm. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) measurements were carried out. Finally, the electrochemical properties of the self-assembled ASC device were investigated employing a two-electrode system.
The areal capacitance (Ca) was calculated according to the discharge curve using the following equation: (1)where I (A) represents the discharge current; Δt (s) represents the discharge time; S (cm2) is the effective electrode area; and ΔV (V) corresponds to the potential window.
The energy density and power density of the flexible ASC device were calculated based on the following equations: (2) (3) (4)where CU is the volumetric capacitance of the ASC device; I (A) refers to the discharge current; Δt (s) stands for the discharge time; and ΔV (V) corresponds to the potential. U (cm3) is the total volume of the ASC device.
3. Results and discussion

Scheme 1 illustrates the synthesis strategy for Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWAs, and shows a facile three-step procedure. Firstly, the Cu(OH)2 NWAs were in situ fabricated on the Cu foam substrate by the typical wet chemical method with an alkaline oxidative etchant solution (AOES) at room temperature. Afterwards, the obtained Cu(OH)2 NWAs transform into Cu3N NWAs through an nitridation process under an NH3 flow. Subsequently, the CoFe-LDH NSs were grown uniformly on the Cu3N nanowire (NW) skeleton by an electrodeposition method, forming the embedded hierarchical Cu3N@CoFe-LDH core–shell nanostructure supported on the Cu foam substrate.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were then employed to investigate the morphological and structural evolution. As shown in Fig. 1a, the SEM images of the as-prepared Cu(OH)2 NWAs reveal vertical and high density nanowire arrays in situ growing on the surface of Cu foam, with a uniform diameter in the range of 150–200 nm and a length distribution of 9–10 μm (Fig. S1a†). Significantly, the morphology of vertical nanowires almost doesn't change when the Cu(OH)2 NWAs transformed into Cu3N NWAs (Fig. 1b) by a nitridation procedure. It should be noticed that the formed Cu3N NWs are composed of nanoparticles, which results in porous Cu3N NWs as shown in Fig. 1c. Finally, after coating with CoFe-LDH NSs by an electrodeposition route with an optimized scheme, the Cu3N NWAs evolved into the target product, Cu3N@CoFe-LDH core–shell NWAs with a vertical and intercrossing ultrathin CoFe-LDH NS shell (∼120 nm in lateral size and ∼2.5 nm in thickness) shown in Fig. 1d and e. The electrodeposition process of the LDH shell was further studied by controlling the reaction time. It is found that the electrodeposition time (0–200 s) of the LDH shell imposes a significant influence on the shell thickness and morphology (Fig. S2a–d†): with increasing electrodeposition time, the LDH shells become much thicker and denser so that the sample surface is full of cracks when the electrodeposition time is 200 s. Thus, we selected an electrodeposition time of 100 s as the experimental condition for the following samples. TEM measurement was then performed to further confirm the Cu3N@LDH core–shell nanostructure. According to Fig. 1f and g, the core–shell structure with the Cu3N NW core consisting of nanoparticles and an ultrathin LDH NS shell was identified clearly. The diameter of the Cu3N NW core is ∼100 nm and CoFe-LDH NSs have a lateral size of ∼150 nm. Meanwhile, the thickness of ultrathin CoFe-LDH NSs is determined to be only 2.5 nm or even less than 2.5 nm in terms of the crimped part of LDH NSs as shown in the enlarged image (Fig. 1h). Since the thickness of a single layer LDH is about 0.8 nm,41 the CoFe-LDH NSs consist of around 3 layers or less in our samples. It is worth noting that the ultrathin CoFe-LDH NSs grew from the interior of the Cu3N NW core, which profits from the porous Cu3N NW composed of nanoparticles. This special growth mechanism stabilized the core–shell structure and enhanced the electron transfer from the shell to the core, thus improving the electrochemical performance. As shown by the lattice fringes (Fig. 1g inset), the d-spacing from high resolution TEM (HRTEM) is ∼0.25 nm, corresponding to the (012) plane of CoFe-LDH. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image reveals a characteristic polycrystalline structure (Fig. 1i), which can be indexed to the (110), (101), and (100) planes belonging to trigonal hydroxide structures, and an oriented growth along the [001] direction.42,43 Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) provides the distribution of elements (Fig. S3†), from which the elemental contents of Cu, Co, Fe and N of Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWs are found to be 62%, 5.5%, 4.87% and 27.61%, respectively. The atomic ratio of Fe to Co is very close to 1:1, and the Cu:N atomic ratio is close to 3:1, corresponding to molecular Cu3N.

XRD (powder X-ray diffraction) was utilized to identify the components of the samples. As shown in Fig. 2a, the Cu foam shows three strong diffraction peaks at 43.3°, 50.4° and 74.1°, which can be indexed to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of cubic metallic copper (JCPDS No. 04-0836), respectively. The Cu(OH)2 NWAs display several diffraction peaks at 16.6°, 23.7°, 34°, 35.8°, 38.1°, 39.7°, and 53.3°, corresponding to the (020), (021), (002), (111), (022), (130), and (150) planes of orthorhombic Cu(OH)2 (JCPDS No. 13-0420), respectively. For the Cu3N NWAs, the main diffraction peaks at 23.3°, 33.2°, 40.9°, and 47.6° can be assigned to the (100), (110), (111), and (200) planes of Cu3N with a cubic structure (JCPDS No. 47-1088), respectively. No signal from possible impurities is detected, indicating the successful transformation from Cu(OH)2 to Cu3N after the simple nitridation reaction. After coating with the CoFe-LDH shells, the XRD spectrum of Cu3N@LDH exhibits a superimposition of Cu3N and LDH. The three diffraction peaks at 11.7°, 23.5° and 34.8° match well with the (003), (006) and (012) planes of the typical CoFe-LDH material (JCPDS 50-0235), indicating high crystallinity. Meanwhile, the XRD spectrum of CuO NWAs is shown in Fig. S4a† for the contrast experiment. The Raman spectra of the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH and Cu3N NWAs are shown in Fig. 2b as additional evidence of the formation of the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH nanostructure. The two peaks at 277 and 616 cm−1 correspond to the nanowire Cu3N backbone.44 The peaks at 456 and 523 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching of the OH–O bond between carbonate ions and water molecules in the interlayer region of CoFe-LDH.36 In order to further investigate the chemical states of the element on the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH surface, XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) measurements were also employed. As shown in Fig. 2c, the full XPS spectrum of the resulting material shows strong signals of Cu, Co, Fe, O and N elements. High resolution XPS was used to further analyze the Co 2p, Fe 2p and Cu 2p core level spectra in Fig. 2d and e, and S5.† The Co 2p orbital linearly split into Co 2p3/2 at a binding energy of 780.6 eV and Co 2p1/2 at a binding energy of 796.7 eV, peaks accompanied by two satellite bands at 785.5 and 802.1 eV (Fig. 2d), indicative of a high-spin Co2+ state in the CoFe-LDH NSs.38 The peaks of Fe 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 are located at 724.9 eV and 711.0 eV (Fig. 2e), respectively, indicating that the predominant Fe species within the LDH is Fe2+.24 The Cu 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 spectra fit perfectly with a line centered at binding energies of 952.5 eV and 932.8 eV (Fig. S4b†), respectively, proving the copper in Cu3N NWAs is positive monovalent copper (Cu1+).45,46

The electrochemical characterization of the samples was performed using a three-electrode system with a Pt foam counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode in 2.0 M KOH alkaline electrolyte at room temperature. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were carried out in the potential range of 0 to 0.5 V. Fig. 3a shows the comparison of classical transition metal oxide material CuO NWAs,25 precursor Cu3N NWAs10 and resulting material Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWAs at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Remarkably, Cu3N NWAs display redox peaks at 0.36 V and 0.25 V, similar to those of CuO NWAs, but exhibit a CV curve with larger integral area (indicating enhanced capacitance), which is attributed to the same quasi-reversible redox transition between Cu2+ and Cu+ and superior conductivity of Cu3N NWAs.47,48 Consequently, as a result of inheriting the merits of the Cu3N material, Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWAs have a CV curve with the largest integral area, indicating high capacitance. Notably, the total capacitance of Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWAs is dominantly contributed by the CoFe-LDH NS shell. Typical CV curves of Cu3N@CoFe-LDH are shown in Fig. 3b at different scan rates from 5 to 50 mV s−1. Although there are no very obvious redox peaks, the shape is still quite different from the ideal rectangular shape associated with electric double-layer capacitance, indicating pseudocapacitive behavior.10,49

(e) Current density dependence of the areal capacitance, (f) Nyquist plots of EIS and (g) cycling performance of the pristine CuO, Cu3N and Cu3N@CoFe-LDH. 
As a significant gauge, galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) measurement was then employed in the potential range of 0–0.45 V to characterize the capacitance performance of the samples. Fig. 3c shows the GCD curves of CuO NWAs, Cu3N NWAs, and Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWAs at the same current density (1 mA cm−2), respectively. The charge–discharge characteristics of all these samples exhibit a typical pseudo-capacitive behavior, consistent with the results of CV. The corresponding areal capacitances are calculated to be 3078, 934, and 596 mF cm−2 for the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWAs, Cu3N NWAs, and CuO NWAs, respectively, demonstrating the high areal capacitance of the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWA sample. The enhanced areal capacitance attained (for Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWAs) is much higher than those of similar supercapacitor electrodes in other previous reports (Table S1†). Fig. 3d exhibits the GCD curves of Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWAs at different current densities (1–20 mA cm−2). At a current density of 1 mA cm−2, the calculated corresponding areal capacitance is 3078 mF cm−2 and a high areal capacitance of 2641 mF cm−2 (85.8%) is still retained at a high current density of 20 mA cm−2. Corresponding to the CV result, GCD also confirms the superior areal capacitance of Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWAs. In addition, the electrodeposition time of the LDH shell also has an evident impact on the supercapacitive performance of the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH samples. The areal capacitance of Cu3N@CoFe-LDH increases with prolonging the deposition time of LDH and reaches a maximum of 3078 mF cm−2 at a deposition time of 100 s. However, as the deposition time continues to increase, the capacitance begins to decrease (Fig. S5†), which can be explained by the fact that the caking of the LDH shell leads to a reduced exposure of active sites and hinders the charge transfer.
Rate capability is a key factor for evaluating the power applications of supercapacitors, and is the areal capacitance calculated as a function of the discharge current density. Fig. 3e shows the rate capability curves of the three samples derived from the GCD curves at various charge–discharge current densities. Obviously, over the whole current density range, the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH displays a much higher areal capacitance than Cu3N and CuO at a high current density of 20 mA cm−2 (Fig. S6†); the areal capacitance of the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH sample remains at 85.8%, which has rarely been reported before. In the case of the other two samples, however, only 73.8% and 61.2% of areal capacitance are retained for Cu3N and CuO, respectively. The superior rate capability for Cu3N@CoFe-LDH is mainly a result of the enhanced conductivity contributed by Cu3N NWs as the core and the ultrathin CoFe-LDH NS shell improved the mass transfer efficiency of the electrode–electrolyte interface. The enhanced electrochemical performance of Cu3N@CoFe-LDH is also confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Fig. 3f exhibits the Nyquist plots of the EIS spectra for Cu3N@CoFe-LDH, Cu3N, and CuO electrodes that were obtained at the open circuit potential in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz, which consist of a partial semicircle at high frequency and an inclined line in the low-frequency region.50 In the equivalent circuit, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) reflects the results of the faradaic reactions of the electrode–electrolyte interface, related to the diameter of the semicircle. The Warburg impedance (Zw) related to the ion diffusion of the electrolyte is presented by the sloped curve.51 The Cu3N@CoFe-LDH has a smaller Rct value of 0.58 Ω than Cu3N (0.81 Ω) and CuO (1.4 Ω) electrodes, indicating a faster electron transport. Meanwhile, the straight line of the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH is more vertical, revealing a more rapid ion diffusion rate in the electrolyte than that of Cu3N and CuO electrodes, which agree well with the superior rate capability.
As another important feature for supercapacitors, the cycling stability of the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWA electrode was investigated by continuous charge–discharge measurements carried out at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 over 10000 cycles (potential window: 0–0.45 V). The areal capacitance of the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH electrode still remains at 93.9% after 10000 cycles (Fig. 3g), demonstrating superior capacitance retention compared to Cu3N and CuO electrodes, which exhibit only 87.1% and 71.7% capacitance retention, respectively, after 5000 cycles. In the last 20 cycles, the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH electrode displays very stable charge–discharge curves (Fig. S7†), confirming the long-term electrochemical stability of the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH electrode. It is believed that in the embedded core–shell nanostructure, the ultrathin CoFe-LDH NS shell arising from the interior of the Cu3N NW significantly improved the mechanical stability of the nanocomposites, which effectively reduced the shedding of CoFe-LDH NSs from the Cu3N NW and volume change of the Cu3N NW during the charge–discharge process. Corresponding to the above, the SEM image and XRD pattern of the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH electrode after 10000 cycles is shown in Fig. S8,† from which it is found that the hierarchical core–shell nanostructure almost did not change and the crystalline structure was well preserved.
In order to elucidate the possible origins of such extraordinary performance, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the as-prepared Cu3N@CoFe-LDH and Cu3N NWA sample was also estimated by the double-layer capacitance (Cdl).52 The CdI of the two samples shown in Fig. S10† was calculated by the non-faradaic reaction CV region (Fig. S11†), in which the CdI of Cu3N@CoFe-LDH is 927.5 mF cm−2 and 3.3 times higher than that of the Cu3N sample (281.1 mF cm−2). This higher ECSA of Cu3N@CoFe-LDH demonstrates the larger specific surface area and more exposure of the active sites achieved after the CoFe-LDH coating, benefitting the intimate contact with the electrolyte and the occurrence of more faradaic reaction, thus improving the electrochemical performance.
Based on the above discussion, the outstanding electrochemical performance of the Cu3N@LDH core–shell NWAs could be attributed to the following factors: (1) the ultrathin CoFe-LDH NSs contribute to increasing the specific surface area of the whole electrode, which is beneficial for exposing more redox reaction active area, and greatly reducing the mass transfer distance between the electrolyte and the substrate.24 Meanwhile, diffusion of reactive ions from the electrolyte into the inner part of CoFe-LDH is favorable, ensuring that the faradaic redox reaction is adequate. (2) The porous Cu3N NWs rooted into the Cu foam firmly grasp the shell CoFe-LDH NSs like a tree trunk, not only ensuring good electrical contact and mechanical stability, but also partly contributing to the total capacitance.10 (3) The unique 3D embedded core–shell nanostructure can effectively reduce the shedding of CoFe-LDH NSs from the Cu3N NW and volume change of the Cu3N NW during the charge–discharge process, improving the cycling stability. Also, it facilitates efficient electron transfer from the current collector Cu foam to the outer shell of CoFe-LDH NSs.
Asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) possess great potential for practical applications due to their high energy density and power density. For further demonstrating the potential application of the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWA electrode material, a flexible asymmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated by using Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWAs (supported on a Cu foam substrate) as the positive electrode, Ni foam supported active carbon (AC) as the negative electrode and 2 M KOH as the electrolyte, whose configuration is schematically shown in Fig. 4a. The AC negative electrode presents typical performance of carbon-based materials, exhibiting 165 F g−1 specific capacitance as shown in Fig. S9.† Based on the capacitance values of the Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWA electrode, the mass of AC on the negative electrode was set to 8.4 mg cm−2 to get the positive and negative charges to match (Q+ = Q−). Fig. 4b shows the CV curves of the Cu3N@LDH NWAs//AC asymmetric supercapacitor device at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 within different potential windows. Obviously, the assembled ASC device exhibited quasi-rectangular shaped CV curves in the potential window of 0–1.5 V and the faradaic reaction occurs more sufficiently with the increase of operating potential from 1.3 V to 1.5 V. As the potential window was extended up to 1.6 V, an undesirable oxygen evolution reaction induced peak was clearly observed. This indicated that the maximum working potential window this ASC device can deliver is 0–1.5 V, which was therefore chosen as the optimal voltage window for further investigation. Fig. 4c displays the CV curves of the ASC device at scan rates of 5–50 mV s−1 between 0 and 1.5 V. In contrast to the obvious redox peaks observed in the Cu3N@LDH NWA single electrode, these CV curves exhibit a quasi-rectangular shape, suggesting a pseudo-constant charge–discharge rate process over the entire voltammetry cycle. Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curve measurements were then performed to evaluate the capacitance of the ASC device. The GCD curves at various current densities (2–20 mA cm−2) and corresponding cell capacitances are shown in Fig. 4d and e, respectively, from which the ASC device delivers a high areal capacitance of 1190 mF cm−2 at a current density of 2 mA cm−2 and 1030 mF cm−2 at a current density of 20 mA cm−2, corresponding to a high retention of 86.6%. The linear symmetric charge–discharge profiles indicate a good rate capability with a rapid I–V response. According to GCD curves, the energy and power density were calculated based on eqn (3) and (4); the Ragone diagram is plotted in Fig. 4f, and it further evaluates the energy efficiency of this ASC device. Our ASC device exhibits an ultrahigh energy density of 2.474 mW h cm−3 at a low power density of 15 mW cm−3. Even at a high power density of 150 mW cm−3, the energy density still remains at 2.035 mW h cm−3, making it superior to previously reported ASC devices such as CuO@LDH//AC (1.857 mW h cm−3),24N-Fe2O3//MnO2 (0.41 mW h cm−3),53 VOx//VN (0.61 mW h cm−3),48 and Ni/GF/H–CoMoO4//Ni/GF/H–Fe2O3 (1.13 mW h cm−3),54 among others.55–57 As shown in Fig. 4g, the cycling performance of the Cu3N@LDH NWAs//AC asymmetric supercapacitor was also evaluated by the GCD measurement method at a high current density of 40 mA cm−2. After 10000 cycles, the capacitance retention can still reach 92.6%, indicating its excellent stability. To further demonstrate its potential for practical application in energy storage and conversion, we assembled two fully charged series-connected ASC devices to light a white light-emitting-diode (Fig. 4g inset), demonstrating its suitability as a flexible energy storage device for practical applications.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a novel embedded hierarchical core–shell nanostructure with an ultrathin CoFe-LDH NS (∼2.5 nm) shell and a highly conductive Cu3N NW core has been successfully prepared via a facile in situ alkaline corrosion route and electrodeposition coating process. The Cu3N@CoFe-LDH NWA electrode exhibits a high areal capacitance of 3078 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2, excellent cycling stability (92.6% retention after 10000 cycles) and ultrahigh rate capability with 85.8% capacity retention at 20 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the self-assembled Cu3N@CoFe-LDH//AC asymmetric supercapacitor displays a high energy density of 2.474 mW h cm−3 at a power density of 15 mW cm−3. The excellent electrochemical properties can be ascribed to the ultrathin CoFe-LDH NS shell, the highly conductive Cu3N NW core and the embedded core–shell nanostructure, which provided many more reaction active sites, accelerated the transport rate of electrons, and strengthened the stabilization of the whole hierarchical core–shell nanostructure. Based on these results, it is expected that this work on an ultrathin CoFe-LDH, embedded core–shell nanostructure and porous Cu3N NWA core will provide some inspiration to break the research bottleneck of energy storage devices.
