    , Accepted 3rd September 2019First published on 4th September 2019AbstractThe popularity of colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar cells has increased owing to their tunable bandgap, multiple exciton generation, and low-cost solution processes. ZnO nanoparticle (NP) layers are generally employed as electron transport layers in CQD solar cells to efficiently extract the electrons. However, trap sites and the unfavorable band structure of the as-synthesized ZnO NPs have hindered their potential performance. Herein, we introduce a facile method of ZnO NP annealing in the colloidal state. Electrical, structural, and optical analyses demonstrated that the colloidal-annealing of ZnO NPs effectively passivated the defects and simultaneously shifted their band diagram; therefore, colloidal-annealing is a more favorable method as compared to conventional film-annealing. These CQD solar cells based on colloidal-annealed ZnO NPs exhibited efficient charge extraction, reduced recombination and achieved an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.29%, whereas the CQD solar cells based on ZnO NPs without annealing had a PCE of 8.05%. Moreover, the CQD solar cells using colloidal-annealed ZnO NPs exhibited an improved air stability with 98% retention after 120 days, as compared to that of CQD solar cells using non-annealed ZnO NPs with 84% retention.
Introduction
Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising materials for optoelectronics, such as photodetectors,1,2 light-emitting diodes,3,4 phototransistors,5,6 and solar cells.7,8 CQDs are particularly promising in solar cell applications owing to the following features: (i) CQDs show size-dependent optical bandgaps, which can absorb a broad range of light from ultraviolet (UV) or visible to the near-infrared region;9 (ii) CQD solar cells theoretically present a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 45% in single-junction devices owing to multiple-exciton generation;10 (iii) the solution processability of CQDs allows the large-scale and low-cost fabrication of solar cells and provides compatibility with flexible substrates.11 Recently, although the PCE of CQD solar cells have greatly improved, they are still far below the theoretical maximum value. To overcome and increase CQD photovoltaic performance, a lot of research has been conducted to improve the charge diffusion by passivating the surface defects of CQDs,12–14 improve charge extraction via device architecture engineering,15 and increase the amount of light absorption by introducing plasmonic or photonic structures.16,17
The device configuration for the high efficiency CQD solar cells is designed with a transparent electrode/electron transporting layer (ETL)/CQD layer/hole transporting layer (HTL)/top electrode.15 This structure contains a heterojunction between the n-type ETL and CQD layer, which forms a depletion region to efficiently separate and transport charge carriers. Because the heterojunction is designed based on the ETL, it is important to choose ETLs featuring excellent optical, electrical, and physical properties for efficient charge carrier extraction. In general, wide bandgap n-type metal oxide semiconductors, such as ZnO and TiO2, are used as ETLs in CQD solar cells.18 In particular, ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) are widely employed as ETLs, showing the best performance in CQD solar cells because of their high electron mobility, optical transparency, ease of fabrication, and appropriate work function.15,19 However, the as-synthesized ZnO NPs present several drawbacks, such as surface defects, which determine the sub-band energy levels.20,21 These sub-band energy levels act as electron trap states and induce charge recombination, thus leading to the poor device performance of the CQD solar cells. Moreover, the conduction band level of ZnO NPs is not comparable with that of the CQD layer, leading to an unfavourable energy band alignment in the device.22,23 This misalignment increases the interfacial charge recombination between CQDs and ETLs caused by inefficient charge extraction.
In order to address these issues and improve the performances of solar cells, various efforts have been made. Foreign atoms, such as K and Cl, have been incorporated into the as-synthesized ZnO NPs to passivate the surface trap sites, leading to a decrease in the probability of recombination.24,25 Organic and inorganic passivating agents employed as interlayers have been developed to passivate the defect states on ZnO NP-based films.22,26,27 Improved synthesis methods of ZnO NPs have been suggested to widen the depletion region by upshifting the Fermi level, which improved the charge drift in the PbS active layer of CQD solar cells.28 A simple method of conventional film-annealing was also demonstrated to passivate trap-sites under an oxygen-rich environment at a high temperature of 300 °C.29 However, film-annealing at high temperatures induce the sintering phenomenon within NP-based thin films, preventing them from showing NP properties and also changing the film morphology, causing different interactions with CQD layers. Moreover, those conditions for film annealing are not matched with the advantages of flexible devices and affordable prices. Although the aforementioned treatments could improve the charge extraction properties or reduce the surface defects of ZnO NPs, the ZnO NP layers need to be further improved to achieve both goals without side effects.
In this study, we introduced a simple method to efficiently passivate trap sites and simultaneously control the conduction band level of ZnO NPs for PbS CQD solar cells (Fig. 1). We proposed a strategy of colloidal-annealing, which can anneal the ZnO NPs and effectively modify their properties under mild conditions. We investigated the shifts in energy and doping levels, stoichiometry, and crystallinity of ZnO NPs without annealing, with film-annealing, and with colloidal-annealing, using electrical, optical, and structural analysis methods. We correlated the properties of colloidal-annealed ZnO NPs with the photovoltaic performance of ZnO/PbS heterojunction solar cells. The favorable energy level of ZnO NPs with colloidal-annealing boosted the built-in potential (Vbi) and increased the open circuit voltage (VOC), charge extraction efficiency of CQD solar cells compared with solar cells based on ZnO NPs without annealing or with film-annealing. Capacitance–voltage measurements and light intensity-dependent efficiency analysis indicated that colloidal-annealing effectively reduced the trap-based charge recombination. These improved the CQD solar cell properties by colloidal-annealing that led to a higher PCE of up to 9.29% and long-term air stability of up to 120 days. This facile method for effectively passivating defects and improving the electrical properties of ZnO NPs could provide a promising strategy for optoelectronics to improve the performance and achieve low-cost processes.

Experimental
Materials
Lead(II) oxide (PbO) (99.99%) and ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) were purchased from Alfa Aesar Co. Zinc acetate dihydrate, potassium hydroxide (KOH), oleic acid (OA) (90%), 1-octadecene (ODE) (90%), bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide (TMS2) (98%), lead(II) bromide (PbBr2), lead(II) iodide (PbI2), n-octane (99%), dimethylformamide (DMF), 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT), butylamine, and acetonitrile were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. All reagents were utilized without further purification.
Synthesis of ZnO NPs and PbS QDs
All compounds were synthesized using the formal Schlenk line technique. ZnO NPs were synthesized using the method outlined in a previous report, with a slight modification.30 Zinc acetate dihydrate (2.95 g) was dissolved in methanol (125 mL) and the solution was added to a 250 mL three-necked flask. The flask was heated to 65 °C, and KOH solution (1.48 g in 65 mL methanol) was slowly added to the flask. The mixture was maintained at 65 °C for 2 h 45 min under stirring and was then naturally cooled to room temperature. The obtained ZnO NPs were washed three times with methanol, followed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 3 min. Subsequently, the ZnO NPs were collected in chloroform (50 mg mL−1).
PbS QDs were synthesized using the method described in a previous report with a slight modification.31 A solution of 2.4 g OA, 0.92 g PbO, and 20 mL ODE was degassed in a 100 mL three-necked flask for 30 min under vacuum. Next, the solution was heated for 2 h to 120 °C until it became transparent. Then, the solution was cooled to 110 °C and was maintained under a nitrogen atmosphere. The sulfur precursor (420 μL TMS2 in 8 mL ODE) was prepared in a 10 mL syringe and was then rapidly injected into the flask. After the injection, the solution was allowed to cool to room temperature via ice-cooling. The as-synthesized and the QDs were moved to a glove box and were washed three times with acetone and ethanol. Lastly, the QDs were dispersed in octane (50 mg mL−1). A previously reported solution exchange method was used, with slight modification, to cap the QDs with PbI2.13 Lead halides (0.231 g PbI2 and 0.037 g PbBr2) and 0.061 g NH4Ac were dissolved in 5 mL DMF. Subsequently, 5 mL of the as-synthesized QDs (10 mg mL−1) were vigorously mixed with the prepared DMF solution via vortexing. The ligand-exchanged solution was washed with octane twice and centrifuged using toluene. The precipitated QDs were dried under vacuum and dispersed in butylamine (200 mg mL−1).
Fabrication of CQD solar cells
An Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass was cleaned with acetone, isopropanol, and deionized water for 5 min via sonication, and then treated with UV-ozone for 30 min to form hydroxyl groups.32 ZnO NP layers were obtained using three annealing conditions. For the ZnO NP thin films without annealing and with film-annealing, the as-synthesized ZnO NP solutions were spin-coated at the speed of 2500 rpm for 30 s. Then, the films with film-annealing were heated to 80 °C on a hotplate for 15 min. For the colloidal-annealed ZnO NPs, 2 mL of the as-synthesized ZnO NP solution was sealed in a 5 mL vial and annealed at 80 °C for 15 min. To prevent the evaporation of the solvent above the boiling point, we tightly sealed the vial, which increased the internal pressure in the system. Then, the solutions were deposited onto ITO substrates under the same spin coating conditions. The solution ligand-exchanged PbS QDs were spin-coated onto the ZnO thin films at the speed of 2500 rpm for 30 s. Subsequently, the PbS-EDT layer was formed using the solid exchange method. The as-synthesized OA-capped PbS QD (50 mg mL−1) were deposited at the speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s. Then, 0.02 vol% EDT acetonitrile-based solution was dropped to cover the OA-capped PbS QDs films for 30 s, and the films were subsequently washed with the mother solution three times to eliminate residues. These steps were performed twice to form the PbS-EDT layers of the desired thickness. For the anode, an 80 nm thick Au layer was thermally deposited on the PbS-EDT layers. The device area was 4 mm2.
Characterization
A probe station (MST-4000A, MSTECH) and an LCR meter (model 4100, Wayne Kerr) were used to measure the capacitance of the CQD solar cells. Current density–voltage characteristics were obtained using a source meter (Keithley 2400, Tektronix). A solar simulator (94011A, Oriel) was used as the light source (100 mW cm−2 illumination, AM 1.5G). UV–Vis (Cary5000, Agilent Technologies) spectroscopy was performed to characterize the optical properties of the ZnO NP thin films obtained using the three annealing treatments. In addition, an X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/MAX-2500 V, Rigaku) instrument, and a field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM, G2F30ST, Tecnai, Korea Basic Science Institute) device were used to analyze the structure of the ZnO NPs. The local atomic structures of the ZnO NPs were evaluated using X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data of the Zn K-edges of the samples were obtained using the 10C beamline at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL, Korea). The storage ring was operated at an energy of 3 GeV. A scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4300, Hitachi High Technologies America, Inc.) was used to obtain the cross-sectional images of the solar cells. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and UV photo-emission spectroscopy (UPS) (AXIS NOVA, Kratos, Korea Basic Science Institute) instruments were used to obtain the spectra of the ZnO NP thin films measured on Si substrates, and Au deposited on glass substrate, respectively. Photoelectron spectroscopy experiments were conducted using a monochromatized Al Kα (1486.6 eV) source and HeI (21.2 eV) excitation source for XPS and UPS, respectively, under a pressure of 5 × 10−8 Torr and for the energy resolution of 0.1 eV. The secondary cut-off in the UPS spectra was used to determine the work functions (WFs) of materials, according to the following equation: WF = 21.22 eV – secondary cut-off. The difference between the Fermi energy level and the valence band maximum was obtained from the curve fitting of the low binding energy region.
Results and discussion
We synthesized ZnO NPs using the method with minor modifications to the previously reported procedure.30 Briefly, 125 mL of methanol-based zinc acetate solution was added to a three-necked flask and heated up to 65 °C under vigorous stirring. Next, 65 mL of methanol-based potassium hydroxide solution was slowly added to the flask, and the temperature was maintained at 65 °C for 2 h 45 min. The ZnO NPs were separated by centrifugation, washed three times with methanol, and dispersed in chloroform. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis indicated that ZnO NPs with an average size of 5 nm were obtained (Fig. S1†) Using this ZnO NP solution, we prepared three different ETL layers: simple spin-coated a ZnO NP film (hereafter denoted as films without annealing); spin-coated the ZnO NP film that was subsequently annealed at 80 °C for 15 min in film states (denoted as film with film-annealing); and the spin-coated film obtained from solution-annealed ZnO NPs (denoted as film with colloidal-annealing). For films with colloidal-annealing, 2 mL ZnO NP solution was annealed in a 5 mL vial for 15 min at 80 °C in air, prior to spin coating.
The structural properties of ZnO NP thin films without and with annealing were investigated using XRD analysis (Fig. 2a). All three films showed diffraction peaks corresponding to the wurtzite crystal structure (JCPDS #36-1451). We also observed negligible changes in the positions, intensities, and full-width half maximums of each peak, indicating that both film-annealing and colloidal-annealing do not induce changes in the crystal phase, preferred orientation of the film, nor induce grain growth. Further structural analysis, using XANES and EXAFS, was conducted to understand the detailed effects of the colloidal-annealing of ZnO NPs (Fig. 2b and Fig. S2†). Fig. 2b presents the Zn K-edge XANES spectra, which confirmed the structural changes that occurred as a result of the annealing process. The position of the main peak at approximately 9670 eV did not change after annealing, which indicated that the +2 oxidation state of Zn ions in the sample did not change during the annealing process. However, a significant difference in the peak intensity was detected by the polarization effect in the crystalline structure. This intensity change indicated that the concentration of oxygen vacancies in ZnO NPs was reduced during the annealing process. EXAFS results reveal the local structure of ZnO (Fig. S2†). The peaks at approximately 1.5 Å and 3.0 Å in the EXAFS results represent the Zn–O and Zn–Zn bonds, respectively, in the hexagonal ZnO structure. Since both peaks occurred at the same positions after colloidal-annealing, the distance between the atoms did not change even after the annealing process.33

To investigate the surface state and change in the density of oxygen vacancies after colloidal-annealing, XPS surface analysis was conducted, as shown in Fig. 2c. The Zn–O bond data obtained from all samples were deconvoluted into three peaks, where the peak at ∼530.2 eV corresponds to the oxygen atoms in the ZnO crystal, the peak at ∼531.4 eV represents oxygen vacancy defects, and the peak at ∼532.3 V indicates absorbed oxygen.34 The atomic percentages (at%) of oxygen in the lattices, oxygen vacancy defects, and absorbed oxygen were estimated by integrating the intensity of each peak (Table S1†). The percentage of oxygen vacancies in the ZnO NP samples decreased from 20.6 at% for the sample without annealing to 13.0 at% for the film-annealed sample and 12.0 at% for the colloidal-annealed sample. This implied that the oxygen vacancies of ZnO NPs had been passivated through the annealing process. Particularly, the colloidal-annealing was more effective at reducing the oxygen vacancies than film-annealing.
The reduction in the defect density of ZnO NPs was expected to modify the optical properties. Photoluminescence (PL) characterization was performed in these samples, as shown in Fig. 2d. All PL data were normalized to the band edge emission at ∼365 nm, and the broad signal around the peak at ∼550 nm corresponds to defect emissions that predominantly arise from the surface defects in ZnO NPs.30 In agreement with the XPS analysis, the films with colloidal-annealing exhibited the lowest defect emission, followed by films with film-annealing and films without annealing.
In addition to the PL, we also performed photoconductivity measurements. Devices were fabricated by depositing a ZnO NP film on interdigitated Au electrodes; illumination was provided by a 254 nm light source. Consistent with the previous structural and property measurements, films with colloidal-annealing produced the highest magnitude of photocurrent since defect reduction improves the carrier mobility and lifetime for efficient photocharge collection (Fig. S3†).
For ZnO NP films prepared through the traditional film-annealing process, it has been found that O2 present in air dissociates and becomes incorporated on the NP surface, thereby reducing the density of surface oxygen vacancies.31 Moreover, for our films prepared via colloidal-annealing, hydroxyl groups present in the solution acted to remedy the oxygen vacancies through the following reaction route:22,35  
Compared to film-annealing, colloidal-annealing is expected to be more effective at removing oxygen vacancies, since the surfaces of well dispersed and isolated NPs in solution are more accessible than the ones in tightly packed film.33 This, in fact, has high resemblance to the improved optical and optoelectronic properties reported for CQD films prepared from solution-phase ligand exchange CQDs as compared to that of the CQD films obtained from solid-state ligand exchange.13,36
The energy level of the ETL is an important factor for controlling the charge injection and transport in metal–semiconductor junctions and heterojunctions, which determine the efficiency of solar cells.37,38 Indeed, the absolute positions of the energy levels in nanomaterials are known to shift readily while engineering the surface states, which govern the overall properties of the nanomaterials, because of the high surface-to-volume ratios.39,40 We conducted UPS and UV–Vis analyses to examine the energy states of the ZnO NP thin films. The Fermi levels were obtained from the cut-off region of the UPS. The Fermi-levels of the ZnO NP thin films without, with film-annealing, and with colloidal-annealing were determined to be 4.43, 4.44 and 4.44 eV, respectively (Fig. 3a).
 Fig. 3  (a) Cut-off and (b) onset regions of the UPS spectra for each ZnO NP thin film deposited on the Au substrate. (c) Tauc plot and (d) overall band diagram of ZnO NP thin films subjected to different annealing treatments. 
The differences between the Fermi energy levels and valence band edges were calculated from the onset region (Fig. 3b). The position of the valence band of the ZnO NP films without, with film-annealing, and with colloidal-annealing were calculated to be 7.53, 7.62, and 7.70 eV, respectively. The entire UPS spectra of the samples are presented in Fig. S4.† The Tauc plots were obtained from the UV–Vis absorbance spectra, and the energy band gaps of all ZnO NP films were 3.48 eV. This value did not change after annealing, as illustrated in Fig. 3c.
The total energy band schemes for ZnO NP thin films without, with film, and with colloidal-annealing were obtained using combined analyses, and the results are depicted in Fig. 3d. After annealing, the Fermi level shifted upward as compared with the valence band maximum, regardless of the annealing treatment phase. This indicates the increase in n-type doping, which resulted from the released electrons by filling the trap states, and could lead to an increase in the width of the depletion region of the heterojunction between ETL and the light-absorbing layer.25,41 In addition, we observed that the conduction bands shifted downward after annealing. Owing to the strong electronegativity of oxygen that fills vacancies during the annealing process, the ZnO NPs possess higher dipoles, leading to band shifts, similarly observed in CQDs with ligand dipoles.39,40 This band shift observed for the ZnO NP thin films was in good agreement with the previously reported results.25,42,43 As expected, the film with the largest reduction in oxygen vacancies achieved though colloidal-annealing had the deepest conduction band, which is expected to be beneficial for high solar cell efficiency as the heterojunction band alignment conforms more toward ideal configuration (Fig. S5†).
We fabricated PbS CQD photovoltaic devices to investigate whether the improved ZnO NP properties can be translated into enhancing the solar cell efficiency. The fabricated CQD solar cell featured the ITO/ZnO(ETL)/PbS-PbI2(light absorption layer)/PbS-EDT(HTL)/Au structure, as depicted in Fig. 4a. The PbS-PbI2 layer was prepared using the solution ligand exchange method to minimize the surface defects during ligand exchange.13 First, ZnO NP thin films without, with film-annealing, and with colloidal-annealing were deposited onto glass with patterned ITO substrates. Solution-exchanged PbS QDs thin films (light absorption layer) and EDT-treated PbS QDs thin films (HTL) were sequentially deposited on the ZnO NP layer using spin coating. Finally, the Au anode was thermally deposited at a reduced pressure. The PbS CQDs used throughout the fabrication process were 3 nm in size, which is known to be the optimal size for proper solar light absorption and charge transport in CQD solar cells (Fig. S6†).44 The cross-sectional SEM image of the CQD solar cells demonstrated that the ITO/ZnO/PbS-PbI2/PbS-EDT/Au device had been fabricated successfully (Fig. 4b).

Fig. 4c presents the J–V characteristics of solar cells using ZnO NP films prepared without annealing, with film-annealing, and with colloidal-annealing. The figures of merit and the statistical analysis of the CQD solar cell are presented in Table 1 and Fig. S7,† respectively. The colloidal-annealed temperature of ZnO NPs was also optimized under a fixed annealing time, as shown in Fig. S8 and Table S2.† The PCE value of the solar cells using ZnO NP thin films without annealing was 8.05% (a JSC of 21.85 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.606, and a fill factor (FF) of 60.8%), while that of the solar cells employing ZnO NP thin films with film-annealing increased to 8.76% (a JSC of 22.46 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.617, and a FF of 63.1%). The PCE of the solar cells based on ZnO NP films with colloidal-annealing showed 9.28%, the highest of all analyzed solar cells (a JSC of 23.08 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.635, and a FF of 63.3%). The large reduction in the oxygen vacancy defects, which can otherwise rapidly annihilate photogenerated carriers through recombination, stronger n-type doping of ETL, which induces a larger built-in voltage and larger depletion width in the active layer as well as the optimal energy alignment that maximizes charge separation and collection, contribute to the increase in the JSc, Voc and FF.

The characterization of the reverse saturation current in dark current can provide a measure of recombination in the solar cell (Fig. S9†). The magnitude of the reverse saturation current was the lowest in the devices, employing ZnO NP film with colloidal-annealing, whereas the film without annealing showed the highest value; this is consistent with the observed Voc trend.45
The values of capacitance versus voltage for CQD solar cells were also measured, and the corresponding Mott–Schottky plots obtained are shown in the inset of Fig. 5a. The Vbi values obtained from the onset of capacitance were estimated to be 0.667, 0.708, and 0.764 V, for solar cell devices employing ZnO NP film without annealing, with film annealing, and with colloidal-annealing, respectively. From Vbi, the maximum achievable open-circuit voltage (VOC, max) was deduced purely from the quasi-Fermi energy level splitting under illumination.46 The real devices, however, are not ideal and often have (1) defects that induce carrier recombination, (2) non-ideal band alignment (band offset), and (3) band tail states (Urbach states). Thus, due to these non-idealities, the experimentally derived VOC is less than the theoretically calculated Vbi (= VOC, max). The higher Vbi values of the CQD solar cells result from the stronger n-type doping in the annealed ZnO NP thin films, which induced a larger Fermi level separation between the ETL and PbS active layer. The depletion region widths of all CQD solar cells were also investigated. Fig. 5a illustrates the calculated depletion regions, according to the applied voltage24,25 (see details in the ESI†). At the maximum power point (MPP), the width of the depletion region of the CQD solar cell using ZnO NP thin films with colloidal-annealing was 125 nm, while those of the solar cells using ZnO NP thin films without and with film-annealing were 111 nm and 116 nm, respectively. Both the increase in Vbi and the enlargement of the depletion width support our observation of the highest Voc and Jsc enhancement in the device made from ZnO NP film with colloidal-annealing.48

(d) Long-term stability testing of CQD solar cells fabricated using ZnO NP thin films subjected to different annealing treatments. 
Light intensity-dependent photovoltaic performance analysis was further performed to study the recombination kinetics. The current density JSC shown in Fig. 5c can be fitted to the following expression:JSC ∝ Iαwhere I is the light intensity and α is the exponential factor. As the recombination under short circuit conditions decreased, the value of the exponential factor, α, approached 1. Higher α values were obtained for the CQD solar cell made using ZnO NP thin films with colloidal-annealing (0.914 ± 0.04) as compared with those of the cells using ZnO NP thin films without annealing (0.882 ± 0.04) and with film-annealing (0.895 ± 0.04). These results indicate reduced recombination between the ZnO NP and PbS QD layers under short circuit conditions (Fig. 5b). This was attributed to the increased internal electric field owing to the band down-shift for the annealed ZnO NP thin films.
The slopes of the light intensity vs. VOC plots (Fig. 5c) are multiples of kT/q, where k, T, and q represent the Boltzmann constant, Kelvin temperature, and elementary electric charge, respectively.47,48 The probability of charge recombination by trap-sites decreased as the slope decreased. The slope was the lowest for the CQD solar cells using ZnO NP thin films with colloidal-annealing (1.26kT/q) as compared with the cells using ZnO NP thin films without annealing (1.33kT/q) and with film annealing (1.46kT/q). This indicated that the recombination from the trap sites under open-circuit conditions was decreased and successfully demonstrated that the trap sites were filled during the annealing process.49
We also investigated the long-term stability of the CQD solar cells in ambient air in relationship with the annealing treatment of the ZnO NP thin films (Fig. 5d). The PCE of all solar cells increased as compared with the corresponding initial PCE values after the first 30 days owing to oxidation, which p-doped the EDT layer and improved the charge extraction between the PbS-PbI2 and EDT layers.50 After reaching the highest PCE, we observed a decrease in the PCE value in the following sample order: ZnO NPs without annealing > with film-annealing > with colloidal-annealing. Particularly, the CQD solar cell using ZnO NP thin films without annealing exhibited 84% of the PCE retention after 120 days, while the devices using ZnO NP thin films with film-annealing and colloidal-annealing exhibited 94% and 98% retention, respectively. In our experiments, the CQD solar cell using ZnO NP thin films without annealing showed a relatively lower efficiency and air-stability as compared to previous reports.15 We believe that these originated from various factors such as different precursors, washing steps, and synthetic surroundings, etc.14 Also, the only variation in the air-stability experiments was with the ZnO NP layer; all the other layers remained identical, suggesting that the degradation of the ETL and interfacial traps between ZnO NP and PbS CQD layers over time is a significant contributor to the device stability loss.51,52
Conclusions
In conclusion, we developed a simple colloidal-annealing method to passivate the oxygen vacancies of ZnO NP. Colloidal-annealing passivated the oxygen vacancy in ZnO NPs using hydroxyl compounds, and tuned the conduction band in a favorable way for charge extraction. Using these advantages, the CQD solar cell with colloidal-annealed ZnO NP thin films as ETLs achieved the highest PCE of 9.29%, whereas the solar cells with pristine ZnO NP thin films achieved a PCE of only 8.05%. Moreover, the solar cells based on ZnO NP thin films with colloidal-annealing show an improved long-term stability in air owing to the reduced interfacial defects between ZnO NPs and PbS QDs. Considering the wide usage of ZnO NPs, the simple annealing method in this study could be widely utilized for optoelectronics and photovoltaics in the future.
