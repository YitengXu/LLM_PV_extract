    First published on 14th November 2011AbstractPyridine-based ligands, such as 2,2′-bipyridine and 1,10-phenanthroline, have gained much interest in the fields of supramolecular chemistry as well as materials science. The appealing optoelectronic properties of their complexes with heavy d6 transition metal ions, such as Ru(II), Os(II), Re(I) and Ir(III), primarily based on the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) nature featuring access to charge-separated states, have provided the starting point for many studies in the field of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), artificial photosynthesis and photogenerated electron as well as energy transfer processes. This critical review provides a comprehensive survey over central advances in the field of soluble metal-containing macromolecules in the last few decades. The synthesis and properties of functionalized 2,2′-bipyridyine- and 1,10-phenanthroline-based d6 metal complexes, in particular, their introduction into different prevailing polymeric structures are highlighted. In the most part of the review metal complexes which have been attached as pendant groups on the polymer side chain are covered. Selected applications of the herein discussed metal-containing macromolecules are addressed, particularly, with respect to photogenerated electron/energy transfer processes. In order to enable a deeper understanding of the properties of the ligands and metal complexes, the fundamentals of selected photophysical processes will be discussed (223 references).

Introduction
In the last few decades, polymers containing phosphorescent heavy d6 transition metal ion complexes have attracted much attention, since the utility of these metal complexes, in particular of Ru(II), Ir(III), Os(II) and Re(I) ions, led to important applications in materials science. By embedding metal complexes into a polymeric structure, the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the resulting material can be tuned by the nature of the metal complexes, while the properties attributed to the polymer, e.g. processability and film forming ability, can be maintained at the same time. Metal-containing polymers are the topic of different areas of scientific research: supramolecular chemistry,1–7 fundamental electron and energy transfer investigations,8–14 metal ion sensors15–18 as well as electronic devices.19–24 Wong and co-workers have also extensively studied the photovoltaic and optical power limiting applications of metallopolymers containing transition metal elements.25–35 The d6 configured metal ions [i.e. Ru(II), Ir(III), Os(II) and Re(I)] were and are the transition metal ions of choice, because of their exceptional spectroscopic properties featuring photostability and a broad absorption in the visible region. A unique coherence of chemical stability, redox properties, luminescence, excited-state lifetime and excited-state reactivity was the trigger for the synthesis of hundreds of derivatives. The relatively long-lived excited states of the late d6 metal complexes, which are of metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) character, established comprehensive photophysical and photochemical studies leading to a nowadays well-understood field of chemistry.24,36–42 Due to the rapid development in the field of polymers that contain metal complexes,5,11,19,43–49 only selected examples will be discussed in this contribution. Scheme 1 depicts metal complex subunits which were frequently incorporated into macromolecular structures and display the main focus of this review.

In general, a metal complex can be incorporated into a polymer as part of the main chain or as a pendant group. It is also possible to prepare materials in which the metal complex is present in both the side and main chains (e.g. in dendrimers). Based on a categorization by W. K. Chan, there are three different types of metal-containing polymers (Fig. 1).50 The metal ions/complexes are attached to the polymer backbone at the side chain or as an end group by electrostatic interaction, metal–ligand coordination or covalent bonds (Type Ia-c, Fig. 1). In Type II, the metal complexes are part of the polymer main chain (coordination or covalent connection); in the case of Type III, the metal ions are embedded in the polymer matrix by physical interaction.

From the synthesis point of view, two primary procedures were applied to prepare the metal-containing polymers in the course of the article (Scheme 2): (i) the transition metal complex was attached to a polymer backbone after the polymerization process (grafting), and (ii) the metal complex served as a monomer itself and was incorporated into the polymer by (co)polymerzation. In general, there are two possibilities to graft a transition metal complex onto a polymer (Scheme 2): suitable combinations of matching functionalities connected to the polymer and complex, respectively, are applied (a) or the polymer bears appropriate ligand units that can be reacted with a proper precursor complex (b). Further polymerization techniques are described in detail elsewhere.22
 Scheme 2  Schematic representation of the primarily used polymerization techniques. 
The first section recalls some basic concepts on photophysics and photochemistry in d6 metal complexes, since these optical properties are retained in the metal containing polymers and, thus, this knowledge is required to understand the scope of the materials reviewed. Subsequently, selected pyridine-based d6 metal complexes encircling Ru(II), Os(II), Re(I) and Ir(III) ions, which were incorporated into polymeric structures, are discussed that have developed or emerged during the last two decades. The different materials are highlighted with respect to design principles, synthetic strategies, structure–property relationships, and applications in their respective subject area. Since there is a broad range of recent review articles and monographs dealing with 2,2′:2,6′-terpyridine-based materials,5,51–59 this field of research will not be part of this review.
Theoretical aspects of relevant photophysical and photochemical processes
Excited states in d6 transition metal ion complexes
The photophysical behavior of d6 transition metal ions coordinated to one or more N-heterocyclic organic ligands has been intensively investigated.36–38,60–62 The used N-heterocycles cover a broad range of structures and the excited states of the derived complexes strongly differ in energy for both singlet and triplet states. Without considering symmetry, the complexes of second and third row d6 transition metal ions, in particular Ru(II), Os(II), Re(I) and Ir(III), have low spin ground states (S = 0), when ligands which establish a strong ligand field are considered (e.g. 2,2′-bipyridine, carbon monoxide, etc.). Polypyridine ligands are usually colorless molecules possessing σ-donor orbitals localized on the nitrogen atoms and π-donor and π*-acceptor orbitals delocalized to some extent on the aromatic rings. Following a single-configuration one-electron description of the excited state, the promotion of an electron from a π(M) metal orbital to the π*(L) ligand orbitals gives rise to MLCT excited states, whereas promotion of an electron from π(M) to σ*(M) orbitals gives rise to metal-centered (MC) excited states (Δ = ligand field splitting). Ligand-centered (LC) excited states can be obtained by promoting an electron from π(L) to π*(L) (Fig. 2).36,37
 Fig. 2  Simplified molecular orbital diagram for d6 metal complexes in octahedral symmetry showing the three types of electronic transitions without metal–ligand π-bonding interaction.8 
The MC state energy can be controlled by varying either the ligands or the central metal ion (both affecting Δ). The strength of the ligand field increases in the order:
C1 < pyridine ≪ 2,2′-bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline < CN < CO.
For a central metal ion, Δ increases when going down a column of the periodic table. Charge transfer state energies are mainly affected by the ease of oxidation/reduction of the ligands and the metal ion, respectively. For MLCT transitions, more easily reducible ligands and more easily oxidizable metal ions lower the MLCT states. The π–π* state energies are basically dictated by the ligand itself. The energies and intensities of the LC transitions can be tuned by changing either the substituents on the ligand, the heteroatoms in the aromatic ring or the extent of π-conjugation. The degree of spin–orbit coupling is most effectively increased by using higher atomic number metals.8
The thermally equilibrated excited states of these complexes, observed on longer time scales (>ns), are usually assigned to be either MLCT (d–π*) in the case of Ru(bpy)32+ and Os(bpy)32+ or intraligand (IL, π–π*) states of Ir(bpy)33+ with varying degrees of triplet character.63 By contrast, numerous Re(I) complexes having N-heterocyclic ligands with relatively low energy 3IL states exhibit both types of excited states and usually their mixing can be observed in the form of metal-to-ligand–ligand charge transfer (MLLCT) states. These complexes are often luminescent in solution and, in most cases, the observed emission arises entirely from the lowest triplet energy state. Strong spin–orbit coupling induced by the heavy atoms leads to efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) from the singlet excited state to the triplet state. Mixing singlet and triplet states via spin–orbit coupling eliminates the spin-forbidden nature of the T1 → S0 radiative transition yielding relatively high phosphorescence quantum yields. Some relevant parameters are summarized in Table 1 for different d6 metal complexes.36,64

Despite the apparent similarities of these d6 complexes, the excited-state properties have significant differences with respect to their lowest MC, MLCT, and LC triplet states. While keeping the ligands the same, Δ increases while going from Fe(II) over Ru(II) to Os(II). Thus, the MC state energies rise from Fe(II) over Ru(II) to Os(II). The MLCT state energies are in the order Os < Fe < Ru, which reflects the ease of the metal oxidation. Since the MLCT state of Ru(II) complexes is commonly well above the ground state, inefficient radiationless deactivation with a consequential luminescence is usually observed for such complexes. In contrast, Os(II) complexes reveal much shorter emission lifetimes than the Ru(II) analogs (compare Table 1), since the energy of their MLCT state is lower and, consequently, quenching to the ground state is more efficient, as expected by the energy gap law (Fig. 3, left).64
 Fig. 3  Left: lowest triplet state energy ordering for different d6 metal complexes showing the relative positions of the LC, MC and MLCT states. Right: general state diagram illustrating the loss of excitation energy via radiationless decay through the MC state.64 
Photochemistry and deactivation via MC states may be an issue considering photostability, if the MC states are thermally accessible from the excited MLCT state. For example, Ru(bpy)32+ is partially deactivated via an upper MC state. Due to the higher Δ value, the gap to the MC state is larger and the deactivation is less efficient than for the pyridine complex. Furthermore, if the deactivating MC state is thermally activated, there is a significant increase in the deactivation rate as the temperature is raised. Hence, Ru(bpy)32+ shows a strong change in the luminescence lifetime over temperature, which limits its use at elevated temperatures regarding luminescence applications.8,9 A widely accepted model is shown schematically in Fig. 3 (right).
The temperature dependence of the lifetime is given by (1)where kr and knr are the radiative and nonradiative decay constants, respectively, ΔE is the energy gap between the MC state and emitting state (3MLCT), and k′ is the Arrhenius preexponential factor for the thermal activation of the MC state. This model assumes that the deactivation from the MC state is much faster than the return to the MLCT state (k2 ≫ k−1), and, therefore, no thermal equilibrium can be established between the states (e.g. for Ru(bpy)32+ at room temperature). Hence, the correlation of 1/τ with temperature represents a reasonable starting model for calculating the energy gap between the MLCT and MC states over a limited temperature range (∼50 K).8,64
Photophysical and photochemical processes
Any photophysical or photochemical process is initiated by the absorption of a photon by a molecule (Scheme 3). The excited state of the molecule (M*) is higher in energy than the ground state (M). As shown in Scheme 3, the unstable species M* may pass one of the available types of deactivation channels: (i) vanishing of the original molecule (photochemical reaction), (ii) emission of light (luminescence), (iii) losing the excess energy (radiationless deactivation), and (iv) some kind of interaction with another species present in the environment (quenching process).8
 Scheme 3  Representation of possible deactivation channels of excited states (M: molecule, Q: quencher).8 
Each of the intramolecular decay steps is characterized by its own rate constant and each excited state is characterized by its lifetime (τ) and is defined by (2)where k is the first order rate constant for a generic unimolecular process that causes the disappearance of the excited state. An important quantity for transition metal complexes is the quantum yield of emission from the lowest spin-forbidden excited state (phosphorescence quantum yield ϕP) which is ϕP = ηISCkpτP(3)where ηISC is the efficiency of the population of the emitting excited state with (4)and τP is the lifetime of the emitting state: (5)
If the lifetime of the excited state is sufficiently long, there is a high probability that the excited molecule comes across another quencher molecule Q (Scheme 4). In this case, a specific interaction can occur, where kinetic investigations have shown that only those excited states that live longer than ca. 10−9 s have a chance to be involved in an interaction with other molecules. For transition metal complexes, only the lowest spin-forbidden excited state (3MLCT) meets this requirement.67,68 However, there is also the chance that the excited molecule M cannot interact with the quencher due to its diffusion out of the encounter complex cage (Scheme 4, −kdiff). The cage escape yield, e.g. for energy transfer (ϕce), is defined by (6)which describes the extent of the escape of the excited molecule by diffusion and can be determined by transient absorption spectroscopy.69–71
 Scheme 4  Representation of various bimolecular processes in the presence of a quencher.8 
The two most important processes are energy transfer9,10,68 and electron transfer,9,10,67,71 where the latter denotes either the oxidation or the reduction of the excited state.A* + B → A + B* energy transferA* + B → A+ + B− oxidative electron transferA* + B → A− + B+ reductive electron transfer
Electron and energy transfer processes are important, since they can be utilized to quench an excited state, for instance, avoiding intramolecular deactivation. Secondly, these processes are able to sensitize other species, for example, inducing chemical changes or luminescence from species that do not absorb light.
The kinetic aspects of energy and electron transfer processes are discussed in detail elsewhere.39,67,71 However, one important aspect is worth to mention: a molecule in its electronically excited state is a species with rather different properties compared with the ground-state molecule. The ability of an excited state to participate in energy transfer processes is related to its zero–zero spectroscopic energy (E0–0). For the electron transfer the relevant thermodynamic parameters are the oxidation and reduction potentials of the *A/A+ and *A/A− couples (eqn (7) and (8)). Because of its higher energy content, an excited state is both a stronger reductant and a stronger oxidant than the corresponding ground state. The redox potentials for the excited state couples can be calculated in a first approximation from the potentials of the ground state couples and the zero–zero excitation energy E0–0: E(A+/A*) = E(A+/A) − E0–0(7) E(A*/A−) = E(A/A−) + E0–0(8)

Scheme 5 summarizes some important molecular quantities that describe the relationship between ground and excited state parameters.

Transition d6 polypyridine metal complexes have strongly contributed to the development of electron transfer processes. When light is used, as a reactant, and one considers the following situations,A + hν → A*A* + B → A+ + B−there are two thermodynamic pathways for electron transfer reactions (Scheme 6). Firstly, an exergonic reaction, which is slow for kinetic reasons (due to the high activation energy), is considered (Scheme 6, left side): upon light excitation the reductant A is converted into the much stronger reductant A*, thus the reaction between A* and B is much more exergonic than between A and B. The reaction of the excited state is generally much faster than the ground state reaction, since the activation energy usually decreases with increasing exergonicity.
 Scheme 6  Representation of the two possible energetic situations for electron transfer reactions involving an excited state reactant.8 
Here, light is simply used to overcome a kinetic barrier and acts as a catalyst. The second is an endergonic dark reaction (Scheme 6, right side): the charge separation reaction (A + B → A+ + B−) cannot take place for thermodynamic reasons. However, the latter reaction becomes thermodynamically allowed if A is excited to A* and the portion of light energy implied to the reaction is converted into chemical energy of the products. The converted energy is discharged when A+ and B− undergo an electron back-transfer reaction leading to A + B.8
Sensitization by light
Many d6 metal polypyridine compounds are also involved as mediators in photochemical processes.10,68 There are reactions that do not occur because the reactants are not able to absorb light and/or the excited state, responsible for the specific photochemical reaction, has too short of a lifetime. As discussed in the previous section, a chemical reaction A + B → A+ + B− cannot occur because of its endergonic nature. By excitation with light the process would be thermodynamically allowed (Scheme 6). Nevertheless, if neither A nor B is able to absorb the exciting light, still the reaction cannot take place. This is the case if the reaction is sensitized by a species which has specific electrospectroscopic properties; such compounds are called light absorption sensitizers (LASs) and perform as shown in Fig. 4. The LAS has to absorb the light resulting in an excited state and this excited state must be able to oxidize (or reduce) one of the reactants. Finally, if the reduced (or oxidized) LAS is able to reduce (or oxidize) the second reactant the redox process cycle is closed by regenerating the LAS. For an ideal LAS some requirements can be proposed: a reversible redox behavior, suitable ground and excited state potentials, stability towards thermal and photochemical decomposition, as high as possible absorption in a suitable spectral region, a small energy gap between the appropriate excited states, high quantum yield of the reactive excited state, a proper lifetime of the reactive excited state and a high energy content of the reactive excited state.8
 Fig. 4  General photosensitized electron transfer processes by light absorption.8 
Concerning the redox behavior of d6 metal pyridine-based complexes there are fundamental dissimilarities, for instance, when comparing Ru(II) and Ir(III). Cyclic voltammetric studies of Ru(II) polypyridine complexes have shown that they undergo a reversible oxidation associated with the metal-centered Ru(II)/Ru(III) couple as well as a reversible ligand-centered py/py− (py = polypyridine ligand) reduction to form Ru(I). The existence of an oxidizable Ru(II) center and a reducible ligand, in general, establishes a relatively long-lived (10−6 to 10−7 s) low energy MLCT-associated excited state.8,72 When it comes to charged Ir(III) polypyridine complexes cyclic voltammetric studies indicated that oxidation of Ir(III) to Ir(IV) is often irreversible, which was attributed to the preference of oxidation at the ligand rather than at the metal center. As expected from charge considerations, reduction of Ir(III) occurs at a much less negative potential than it does in the corresponding Ru(II) complexes (this process is a reversible one related to reduction at the ligand). In contrast to Ru(II), the oxidation and reduction potentials of Ir(III) complexes suggest a relatively high energy MLCT excited state. As a consequence, Ir(III) is a far stronger oxidizing agent than Ru(II), but a weaker reducing agent.73
Furthermore, LASs can drive some interesting and useful processes:9,11,15,16,74,75 for example, hydrogen evolution has been observed for a number of polypyridine complex sensitized systems.9,67,74,76,77 As the result discussed in the previous paragraph, Ru(bpy)32+ was widely applied as a prototype of a light absorption sensitizer due to the unique photoredox behavior of the Ru(II) metal ion. The splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen by visible light2H2O + hν → 2H2 + O2is endergonic in the dark by 1.23 eV for each of the four electrons involved. This four-electron process requires the following redox potentials:2H2O → 4H+ + 4e− + O2 E0 = +0.82 eV2H+ + 2e− → H2 E0 = −0.41 eV
In principle, Ru(bpy)32+ can act as a LAS and the energetics of the relevant step is as follows (pH = 7):782*Ru(bpy)32+ + 2H+ → 2Ru(bpy)33+ + H2 ΔG = −0.44 eV
In practice, the first step is too slow to compete with the excited state deactivation. A reducing agent (Red) is added, as electron donor, to trap the Ru(bpy)33+ produced in the quenching reaction and suppresses back-electron transfer processes. Additionally, methyl viologen (1,1′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium, MV2+), as an electron mediator, was found to be necessary to transport electrons to the multielectron redox catalyst (e.g. colloidal platinum), which combines two protons and electrons to afford molecular hydrogen (Fig. 5).8*Ru(bpy)32+ + MV2+ → Ru(bpy)33+ + MV+Ru(bpy)33+ + Red → Ru(bpy)32+ + Red+2MV+ + 2H2O + cat. → 2MV2+ + H2 + 2OH−
The best characterized systems are those where the reducing agents are triethylamine (TEA), triethanolamine (TEOA) or ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), respectively.11,74,76,77,79 Hydrogen evolution rates in the Ru(bpy)32+/EDTA system were used, as the standard, for comparing the efficiencies of different catalysts, including colloidal Pt [stabilized with poly(vinyl alcohol)] and suspensions of PtO2 (Table 2). In general, the colloidal metals and the metal oxide suspensions were the most efficient systems. The investigation of the effect of the particle size and catalyst concentration in the colloidal Pt system showed that the rate of hydrogen evolution increases six-fold upon decreasing the radius of the colloidal particles from 50 to 10 nm. For particles of 10 nm radius, the hydrogen generation rate also increased six-fold upon increasing the Pt concentration from 8 mgL−1 to 120 mgL−1.76

In a very recent assay, it was demonstrated that upon arranging the platinum catalyst and the Ru(bpy)32+ sensitizer closely into a gel network, the electronic transmitting reaction to generate hydrogen proceeded more efficiently than in the solution-based systems.82 The system with an immobilized platinum catalyst and the copolymerized sensitizer [Ru(bpy)32+] as well as the mediator (MV) revealed two orders of magnitude higher H2 gas generation rates than the solution systems.
Macromolecules containing pyridine-based Ru(II)/Os(II) complexes
In the early 1980s, chemists faced a time where chemical systems were screened in order to provide the basis for new families of devices, such as solar energy storage systems and light-emitting arrays. One extensively studied example was artificial photosynthesis where solar energy is utilized for the formation of high energy chemicals. A number of molecular features, within a single structure, had to be combined when aiming for applications of those materials including light absorption, direct electron transfer by the utilization of free energy gradients, and the delivery of the photochemically produced oxidative and reductive equivalents to catalytic sites. For this purpose, a number of approaches were explored at the molecular level for creating molecular assemblies for artificial photosynthesis.11,77,83–89
Meyer et al. used polystyrene (PS) as polymer backbone because the molecular structure of the styrene repeating units ensured relatively high inertness toward electron or energy transfer processes. There are no low-lying excited states and oxidation or reduction only occurred either at high oxidative or low reductive potentials. In initial experiments, the copolymerization of styrene and (chloromethyl)styrene (as a mixture of meta, para isomers) via free radical polymerization (FRP) gave atactic polymer samples of varying molar masses and polydispersity index values (PDI) depending on the reaction conditions.90,91 In subsequent investigations only polymers containing the para-isomer were utilized yielding chloro-functionalized copolymers by FRP (Mn ≈ 7000 g mol−1, PDI: 1.6–2.5).92 For the functionalization of these polymers, a new linkage chemistry was developed: nucleophilic chloride displacement by hydroxymethyl-substituted polypyridyl complexes [M(bpy)2(bpyCH2OH)]2+ (M = Ru or Os; bpyCH2OH = 4-methyl-4′-hydroxymethyl-2,2′-bipyridine) in the presence of CsOH, as base, in DMSO gave the metal-containing copolymers Ru-I (Scheme 7, see structural details in Table 3).90,92 By using an excess of the metal complex, quantitative substitution at the available chloromethylated sites on the polymer was achieved yielding macromolecules with a high degree-of-metal-loading (Scheme 7, Ru-Ia, Ru-Ib).

The mixed Ru(II)–Os(II) polymer Ru-Ic was investigated by means of different photophysical techniques with respect to intra-strand electron and energy transfer—stemmed by the issue of concentrating redox equivalents to a particular spot—where the desired photon-driven transformation is supposed to occur. The Os(II) units acted as a trap, whereas energy transfer via *Ru(II) → Os(II) was favored by ΔG = −0.36 eV. Transient emission measurements in MeCN showed that rapid energy transfer (k > 2 × 108 s−1) occurred only at Ru(II) sites adjacent to Os(II) complexes.92 In later experiments, it was shown by laser flash photolysis at high irradiances that multiphoton excitation in the presence of high concentrations of phenothiazine (PTZ), as reductive quencher, led to individual polymeric strands that were reduced by up to seven electrons:93[co-PS–CH2OCH2–(RuII)30]60+ + 7hν + 7PTZ → [co-PS–CH2OCH2–(RuII)23(RuI)7]53+7PTZ˙+
A problem occurred concerning the storage of multiple redox equivalents, which is illustrated in Fig. 6 for a polymer with a high loading of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ units: upon excitation and electron transfer quenching, oxidative equivalents, such as Ru(III), were observed on the polymeric strands. The second excitation occurred at a Ru(II) site adjacent to Ru(III) and electron transfer from *Ru(II) to Ru(III) was favored by a free energy change of −2.1 eV and led thereby to unproductive self-quenching of the excited state.96,97

The utilization of ether-linked polymers for the study of photochemical electron and energy transfer was limited due to the failure of facile intra-strand energy transfer. Consequently, amide-based linkage chemistry was used by the same group by applying the well-developed coupling chemistry between amines and carboxylic acids. The acid-derivatized complexes [M(bpy)2(bpyCO2H)]2+ (M = Ru or Os; bpyCO2H = 4-methyl-(2,2′-bipyridine)-4′-carboxylic acid) were added in different stoichiometric amounts to polystyrene-based polymers by amide coupling in DMF/CH2Cl2 solvent mixtures providing metallopolymers Ru-II (Scheme 7, see details in Table 3).94,98 Spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements showed that the properties of the polymer-bound complexes were similar to those of the isolated monomers, and evidence for multi-photon effects in fully loaded polymers was found. There was also a striking difference between the ether- and amide-linked polymers in their abilities to enable intra-strand energy transfer: the amide-linked polymers Ru-II revealed two orders of magnitude higher energy migration rates which was attributed to the differences in orientation of the excited-state dipoles.98–100 A comprehensive insight in the excited-state dynamics of Ru-IId was gained by time-correlated single photon counting with picoseconds time resolution in MeCN at room temperature. In these experiments, the *Ru(II) emission decay at λmax = 640 nm as well as the growth and decay, respectively, of *Os(II) emission at λmax = 780 nm was monitored. Average rate constants for nearest neighbor *Ru(II) → Os(II) quenching (k = 2 × 108 s−1) and for *Ru(II) → Ru(II) migration (k = 5 × 107 s−1) were obtained, which explained the efficient *Ru(II) quenching.95
In order to achieve better control over the polymerization, amide-linked polymers were synthesized by living anionic polymerization later on (Scheme 8).101–104 Trimethylsilyl-protected (aminoethyl)styrene was polymerized using sec-BuLi as initiator and yielded polymers with PDI values between 1.08–1.18 characteristic for a “living” polymerization procedure.104 Subsequently, the amino-functionalized polymer was linked to carboxy-functionalized metal complexes, such as [RuII(R-bpy)2(bpyCO2H)]2+ and/or [OsII(bpy)2(bpyCO2H)]2+. Time-resolved emission decay dynamics were analyzed in rigid media [using poly(methyl methacrylate) as matrix] and a direct evidence for Ru(II)* → Ru(II) migration and Ru(II)* → Os(II) energy transfer was obtained by time-correlated single photon counting, as discussed for Ru-IId.99,103,105

Intra-strand energy migration and transfer were shown by Meyer et al. to occur in a trifold functionalized polymer containing Ru(II) and Os(II) complexes as well as 9-hydroxymethyl-anthracene (Scheme 9).10,91,100 The functionalized 1∶1 copolymer Ru-III of styrene and p-(chloromethyl)-styrene that contained: (i) a polypyridyl complex of Ru(II), which upon excitation resulted in a high-energy MLCT excited state, (ii) a polypyridyl complex of Os(II), which had a lower energy MLCT excited state, and (iii) an anthryl derivative, which had a triplet state of intermediate energy. The metal subunits and the 9-anthracenemethanol were sequentially attached by nucleophilic substitution of the randomly located chloride atoms. It was demonstrated that upon excitation of the Ru(II) chromophores, rapid long-range energy transfer (k > 1 × 108 s−1) occurred at the Os(II) centers via a cascade mechanism in which the internal anthryl groups acted as energy relays (Fig. 7). Laser flash photolysis and emission quantum yield measurements showed nearly complete quenching of *Ru(II) by *Os(II), whereby the energy transfer appeared on the timescale of the laser pulse (∼5 ns). In contrast, partly loaded polymers missing the anthracene residue gave no indication for such *Ru(II) → Os(II) energy transfer following excitation at Ru(II).100

The former investigations demonstrated the feasibility of substituted polystyrene as a framework for constructing multifunctional architectures. However, the use of pre-formed polymers suffered from the disadvantage that no control over the relative regional constitution of functional groups along the polymer could be achieved. Consequently, Meyer et al. explored solid phase peptide synthesis and constructed oligopeptides in a stepwise fashion as a tool to control the local array of additional functional groups.106–109
The aim of this approach was to prepare chromophore-electron transfer assemblies with control of both the constitution of added subunits and the 3D-structure of the resulting assembly. For synthesizing the oligoproline helical structural motif, depicted in Scheme 10, the preparation of appropriate amino acids containing the Ru(II) chromophore as well as electron transfer donors and acceptors was required. For this purpose, the L-enantiomer of azidoproline was reduced to the amine (Scheme 10). Subsequently, the amine group was tert-butoxycarbonyl-protected (Boc) and the proline derivative was coupled with [Ru(bpy)2(bpy-COOH)]2+ or with the carboxylic acid derivatives of PTZ, as donor, and the electron transfer acceptor anthraquinone (ANQ). Subsequent solid-state peptide synthesis yielded the 13-residue oligoproline displayed in Scheme 10, which adopted a prolin-II-type helical structure in water as confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) measurements of the amide region.108,109 Quenching of the MLCT excited state of the Ru(II) centers was dominated by PTZ → Ru(II)* reductive electron transfer and occurred within 10–20 ns time scale with solvent-dependent efficiencies (>0.9). It was further shown that the reductive quenching was followed by [RuIIL2L−] → ANQ electron transfer yielding a redox-separated state: the efficiency of its formation was solvent dependent and varied from 33% (1,2-dichloroethane) to 86% (acetonitrile).109

Molecular assemblies, which are capable of harvesting light and convert the absorbed photon energy, were reported by the Fréchet group. However, the demanding multi-step synthesis of dendritic systems, which contain light-collecting dyes at the periphery and channel light to a different dye with extremely high energy-transfer efficiencies, limited their use for realistic applications.110,111 In order to circumvent the troublesome synthesis of such dendrimers, Fréchet et al. established analogous polymers in which the donor–acceptor ratios were optimized by mimicking the dendrimer models (Schemes 11 and 12). Polymers containing coumarin and Ru(dmbpy)32+ (dmbpy = 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine) chromophores were synthesized using a grafting-onto (Scheme 11) as well as a copolymerization approach (Scheme 12) utilizing FRP. It was found that the solubility of polymers derived from Ru(II)-containing monomers was higher than those obtained by grafting of the Ru(II) complexes. The resulting bichromophoric macromolecules exhibited enhanced absorption and luminescence properties compared to single Ru(II) complexes due to an efficient (>95%) energy transfer between the coumarin donor dyes and the ruthenium subunits.112,113 Moreover, a system in which two different donor dyes were present together with a Ru(II) complex (Scheme 12) was synthesized and found to also offer efficient energy transfer to the Ru(II) units.113

Various light-harvesting antennas based on acrylate monomers are depicted in Scheme 13. Schubert et al. utilized FRP to synthesize a methacrylate-based bipyridine pre-polymer. Subsequent grafting of Ru(II) polypyridyl (2,2′-bipyridine or 1,10-phenanthroline) precursor complexes onto the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) copolymer allowed the formation of graft copolymers (Scheme 13, PMMA–Ru), which revealed the optical properties of the corresponding single Ru(II) complex. It was demonstrated that the PMMA backbone did not interfere with the photophysical properties, but enabled the processing of the material.114 In a second approach, a (methyl methacrylate)-functionalized Ru(II) complex was used as comonomer in the free radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA).115 By using different molar monomer-to-initiator ratios the metal content was varied from 1.3 to 22%. The luminescence properties of the Ru(II) subunit were not influenced indicating that self-quenching of the complexes was prevented. The graft-copolymers were processed into thin films, either by spin-coating or inkjet-printing, whereby no aggregation of the metal centers was observed even not for the polymers with higher ruthenium content.116
 Scheme 13  Schematic representation of Ru(II) complexes attached to a polyacrylate backbone (the counter ions are omitted for clarity). 
Miyashita et al. grafted Ru(bpy)32+ on a pre-copolymerized system consisting of N-tert-pentylacrylamide and N-dodecylacrylamide, respectively, as well as an acrylate-functionalized bipyridine (Scheme 13, PNAA–Ru).117 These copolymers formed stable condensed monolayers at the air/water interface. The monolayers were consecutively transformed onto solid supports, yielding Y-type polymer Langmuir–Blodgett118 (LB) films. The UV/vis absorption spectra of the LB films indicated that the Ru(bpy)32+ chromophores were incorporated into the polymer monolayer with a concentration of 3.9 × 10−11 mol cm−2. The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the monolayers deposited on an electrode showed a well-defined symmetrical surface wave revealing reversible redox peaks of Ru(bpy)32+ at different scan rates.119 By depositing the LB films on an ITO electrode in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor (e.g. thiosalicylic acid), a large anodic photocurrent was observed with a rapid response to the light intensity. The conversion efficiencies of photons absorbed by the Ru(II) chromophores varied from 0.8% (dodecyl moiety) to 1.1% (tert-pentyl moiety). In further studies, N-isopropylacrylamide and an acrylate-functionalized 2,2′-bipyridine were copolymerized by FRP and, subsequently, cis-Ru(bpy)2Cl2 was grafted onto the poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) copolymer, which is known to be a thermoresponsive polymer with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 31 °C (Fig. 8). The electron transfer quenching of the PNIPAM–Ru polymer by MV2+ was investigated as a function of temperature. The electron transfer quenching rate constant (kq) in the globular state (i.e. at a temperature above the LCST) was 5 times higher than that in the coil state (i.e. at a temperature below the LCST).117

A crucial issue concerning systems fabricated on flat substrates is the low optical density of chromophores in ultrathin films, since the thinness of active layers results in a limited number of effective photon-interacting chromophores per unit area. One approach toward obtaining a high optical density is the deposition of materials on a porous substrate with a large surface area, which greatly increased the load of chromophores.120 Another approach is the layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition technique developed by Decher, which is a proper method for the deposition of ultrathin films on flat as well as on porous substrates.121 Thin polymer films of P(CM–Ru) (Mn ≈ 1 × 105 g mol−1) bearing Ru(bpy)32+ moieties (Scheme 13) were fabricated by the LBL technique at various concentrations and the light-collecting capability of the ruthenium-containing layer was demonstrated.122 The absorption and the emission spectra were similar to those of individual Ru(bpy)32+ centers and showed the match of the electronic states in the incorporated polymer. The phosphorescence of the Ru(II) moiety was quenched by ferrocene via energy migration between the Ru(II) moieties. The efficiency of the quenching strongly depended on the concentration of the Ru(II) moiety and exhibited its maximum for the polymer with 18 mol% of Ru(II). The diffusion coefficient for the energy migration increased by two orders of magnitude by increasing the ruthenium content from 4 mol% to 18 mol%.
Moreover, functionalized polypyridyl Ru(II) complexes were also grafted onto carbazole-based copolymers synthesized by FRP (e.g.Scheme 13, PCMA–Ru).123 The resulting polymers were characterized in detail and the maintenance of the optical properties of the metal complex was demonstrated.123–125 Recently, Kim et al. have applied carbazole-based polymers with Ru(II) chromophores as photosensitizers in photoconducting devices.126
Another approach to control the construction of functional polymers was the utilization of the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) due to its living nature and considerable functional group tolerance.127–132 Sleiman et al. presented the direct and efficient synthesis of homopolymers and block copolymers bearing Ru(bpy)32+ and Ru(phen)32+ complexes, as pendant groups, via ROMP using a third generation Grubbs' catalyst.133–135 The polymers Ru-IV and Ru-V (Scheme 14) were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, where the degree-of-polymerization (DP) of Ru-IV was calculated as 21. However, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis could not be performed on the polymers, presumably due to strong interactions with the stationary phase. UV/vis absorbance and luminescence studies as well as CV measurements showed that the properties of the Ru(II) monomer were retained in both the homopolymers and the block copolymers. Using the controlled ROMP, the Ru(II)-containing block copolymers Ru-V, consisting of a Ru(II)–bipyridine-based block and a hydrophobic block, were varied with regard to their composition (i.e. block length, block ratio and polymer length) and, subsequently, systematically studied with respect to their self-assembly in different acetonitrile/toluene mixtures.134 Depending on the composition of the solvent various morphologies of the micellar aggregates were observed, whereby polymer Ru-Vf disclosed the largest assortment including tubular structures (20 and 35% toluene, Fig. 9a and b), large spherical bilayers (40% toluene, Fig. 9c) and uniformly sized vesicles (70% toluene, Fig. 9d).

In a very recent publication, Sleiman et al. introduced a new class of block copolymers using ROMP for biological detection applications with signal amplification.136 For this purpose, three classes of ROMP monomers were synthesized: (i) luminescent metal-containing monomers, bearing Ru(II) and Ir(III) bipyridine units, (ii) biologically compatible macromonomers, containing oligoethylene glycol units, and (iii) biorecognizable monomer units, such as biotin (specific binding to avidin137 proteins). ROMP was used to copolymerize these monomers into amphiphilic di- and triblock copolymers (Fig. 10). Since the metal-containing polymers interacted with the stationary phase of the SEC, the metal-free monomers were first employed to synthesize homopolymers in order to demonstrate the controlled nature of the polymerization procedure, whereby PDI values below 1.1 were achieved. The Ru(II)-equipped di- and triblock polymers Ru-VI were examined in detail and formed spherical micelles upon self-assembly in aqueous media. Preliminary photophysical data were recorded for the latter ones and are summarized in Table 4 indicating that the Ru(bpy)32+ units primarily acted as individual chromophores. Currently, the authors are optimizing these systems towards their potential applications as luminescent markers for biological molecules as well as drug delivery systems. Besides the examples evaluated in this section, there are a large number of studies dealing with polypyridyl Ru(II) complexes, as part of the polymer main-chain. These contributions have been reviewed lately by several authors4,5,50,52,58,59,138–142 and will, therefore, not be discussed any further here.

Macromolecules containing pyridine-based Os(II) complexes in the side-chain
In 1990 Heller et al. reported the usage of hydrophilic poly(4-vinylpyridine)s (PVPs), as macroligands, in order to complex Os(II) ions generating stable redox polymers.16,143 These redox polymers were investigated towards their ability of biosensing, in particular, for the mediation of the electrooxidation of glucose. Electron mediators that are commonly employed in amperometric glucose sensors include ferrocenes, quinones, and ruthenium complexes.144–146
Commercial PVP (Mn = 50000 g mol−1) was partially complexed with the Os(II) precursor cis-Os(bpy)2Cl2 and, subsequently, the metal-free pyridine units were quaternized with bromoethylamine resulting in a high hydrophilicity. The same group also copolymerized N-methylvinylpyridinium chloride and Os(bpy)2(4-vinylpyridine)Cl as well as with 1/20 of the vinylpyridine/pyridinium replaced by 4-aminostyrene.143,144,147 It was demonstrated that these Os(II) redox polymers were able to mediate the oxidation of glucose by an electron transfer between polyanionic enzymes (e.g. glucose oxidase) and the polycationic redox polymers by forming a cross-linked redox hydrogel (Fig. 11). However, the complex decomposed with time and the electron transfer rate became evanescently small at high ionic strengths.144,145
 Fig. 11  Electrooxidation of glucose via a high molar mass polycationic redox polymer. (a) Electrostatic interaction of a polycationic redox polymer with a polyanionic enzyme brings the redox centers at a close range for the electron transfer. Electrons are transferred to the electrode via the polymer. (b) Charge transmission and coiling of the redox polymer lead to dissociation of the electrostatic complex, stop the electron transfer, and, thereby, electrooxidize glucose. (c) After covalent bonding of the redox polymer to the enzyme the complex does not dissociate and retains the electrooxidation of glucose.144 
Inner coordination sphere halides, i.e. chlorides, are not easily exchangeable in Os(III) complexes, since they are electrostatically strongly bound. However, they can be exchanged by N-heterocycles like pyridine (py), imidazole (im) or a primary amine if the complex is reduced to Os(II). Accordingly, if an electrode is covered by an adsorbed redox polymer and the Os(III) complex is electroreduced to Os(II), the chlorine ligands of the osmium complex are exchanged by the respective N-heterocycles of the backbone of the adsorbed strands, coordinatively linking the two strands. Thereby, the enzyme-wiring redox polymer avoids a possible phase separation. The polyanionic enzyme (glucose oxidase) forms an electrostatic adduct with the electro-deposited redox polymer and can be electro-deposited as well. Subsequently, the electro-deposited films catalyze the electrooxidation of glucose.16,145
In order to optimize the electrooxidation, new generations of redox polymers have been developed and investigated: crucial parameters, including the tuning of the redox potential of the osmium complex, the substrate diffusion barrier, the electron transfer properties and the optimization of the current density could be improved by employing the redox polymers depicted in Scheme 15.148–151 2,2′-bis(1-Methyl-1H-imidazole) (bim) and 2,2′-bipyridine, respectively, were used as ancillary ligands for the osmium complexes.
 Scheme 15  Schematic representation of Os(II) complexes incorporated in redox polymers (the counter ions are omitted for clarity). 
Schuhmann et al. were also interested in amperometric biosensors utilizing glucose oxidase, as a biological recognition system, whereby the enzyme-integrated prosthetic group (FADH2) was reoxidized by means of an Os(II) complex containing a redox polymer mediator. Though, the related enzyme electrodes have shown distinct sensor properties, the formation of the cross-linked redox hydrogels revealed an unsolved problem regarding reproducibility (due to inhomogeneous thickness of the polymer layer). Consequently, the group of Schuhmann used a modified poly(pyrrole), which was covalently attached to the osmium complexes. In contrast to the cross-linking approach, electrochemically-induced polymerization occurred on the active surface of the working electrode. In addition, the thickness of the polymer film could be controlled via the charge transferred during the polymerization process.152
The reaction sequence yielding a mediator-modified pyrrole derivative is shown in Scheme 16. cis-Os(bpy)2Cl2 can be synthesized by a two-step reaction from K2OsCl6 and 2,2′-bipyridine. The final pyrrole functionalization of the osmium complex was carried out by a ligand exchange reaction with (pyridin-4-yl-methyl)-(6-pyrrol-1-yl-hexyl)amine. The aliphatic spacer chain provided the desired flexibility.
 Scheme 16  Schematic representation of the synthesis of the heteroleptic osmium complex monomer. 
The electrochemically-induced copolymerization of pyrrole152,153 and the pyrrole-functionalized Os(II) complex in the presence of glucose oxidase occurred via intermediate radical cations and was, hence, highly dependent on the presence of molecular oxygen or nucleophilic groups, which could capture the formed radicals. For solubility reasons the counter ion of the osmium complex was changed from hexafluorophosphate to chloride prior to the polymerization process (Scheme 17). Copolymerization of the two monomers could be proven by CV measurements showing nearly symmetric oxidation and reduction waves of the polymer-integrated osmium centers, which indicated surface attached redox species.152,154,155
 Scheme 17  Radical electropolymerization of a pyrrole-functionalized osmium complex (reproduced from ref. 152 with authorization by the American Chemical Society). 
Warren et al. carried out the electrochemical characterization of films obtained by copolymerization of [Os(bpy)2XCl] [Os-PMP, X = 3-(pyrrol-1-ylmethyl)pyridine] with 3-methyl thiophene or 1,2-diaminobenzene.156 The complex was copolymerized with 3-methylthiophene utilizing CV yielding a stable redox active film. Afterwards, a copolymer based on [Os(bpy)2PMP(Cl)]PF6 and 1,2-diaminobenzene was synthesized electrochemically using the so-called membrane templating method.157,158 The obtained films, formed by the latter method, revealed tubular aggregates of the copolymer on the surface and could improve the stability of the system compared to those in the absence of the tubular structures.
Schuhmann et al. could also demonstrate the suitability of Os(bpy)2Cl2-modified poly(vinyl)imidazole (PVI) redox polymers (Fig. 12b) as both immobilization matrix and electron mediator for isolated photosystem-2 (PS2) complexes leading to enhanced water oxidation.159 PVI was synthesized by FRP using 2,2′-azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN), as initiator, and the resulting polymer was subsequently treated with cis-Os(bpy)2Cl2. Similarly, systems based on PVP and PVI were studied as described elsewhere.17,160–162

The polymer immobilized the PS2 firmly on the electrode surface, while its hydrogel-type character still allowed small molecules to diffuse almost freely through the immobilization matrix. Electrons from the PS2-driven water splitting were accepted by the redox centers of the polymer and transferred to the electrode surface. Amino functions on the polymer and on the lysine residues of the protein complex were cross-linked by means of a bifunctional molecule, such as poly(ethylene glycol)diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE), yielding a polymer network. The potential of the redox polymer was determined by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV, Fig. 12a).
The peak at 190 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl, 3 M aq. KCl) was attributed to the Os(II)/Os(III) redox couple. The absence of other peaks indicated that the coordination sphere was uniform for all Os(II) complexes attached to the polymer backbone. Gold electrodes modified with the cross-linked redox polymer and PS2 showed a ten times higher photocurrent (current density ≈ 45 μA cm−2) than the comparable redox polymer systems immobilizing PS2.163,164
A recent publication by Schuhmann et al. comprised a library of over 50 Os(II) complex-containing polymers suited for electrodeposition, which were tested with respect to their electron transfer ability in combination with enzymes, such as glucose oxidase and cellobiose dehydrogenase.165 The redox potential of the resulting poly(acrylate)-based polymers, which were synthesized by FRP, could be tuned over a wide range by grafting different osmium complexes, such as cis-Os(bpy)2Cl2 and cis-Os(bim)2Cl2 (Fig. 13, Table 5). Furthermore, the latter complexes featured an easy exchange of the chlorine ligand by oxygen under mild conditions (at 70 to 90 °C in aqueous solution), when incorporated in acrylic acid-based polymers resulting in a low redox potential. Currently, a few examples of these polymers are investigated towards the design of biofuel cell cathodes.166

Macromolecules containing pyridine-based Re(I) complexes
Rhenium(I)-containing polymers have widely been studied, triggered by their interesting properties: these types of materials combine the advantage of the tunability of the redox and photophysical properties of the Re(I) complex with the processability of an organic polymer, which is predominantly important for low-cost device manufacturing in the field of optoelectronics. The accessible excited states, which are metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT), ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT) and/or intraligand (IL) excited states, are generally involved in the observed luminescence at room temperature.38,50,62,138,141
Rhenium(I) complexes attached on the side-chain
Wolcan et al. have applied ligand substitution reactions on commercial PVP using Re(I) tricarbonyl complexes. The photophysical properties of the resulting Re(I) polymer and the corresponding [(py)Re(CO)3(bpy)]+ monomer were investigated in detail, where solvent, temperature and laser power effects on the distinct photophysical behavior were observed for both the monomer and the polymer (Scheme 18). It has been demonstrated that the incorporation of roughly 200 Re(CO)3bpy chromophores into the PVP had only little impact relative to the single monomers MLCT excited state, if these complexes were irradiated with low photonic fluxes (i.e. steady state irradiations with nhν ≤ 2 mJ pulse−1).167 The temperature dependence of the emission lifetimes (Scheme 18, bottom) in a polar solvent mixture (MeCN/water) showed a bi-exponential behavior for the polymer at temperatures below 15 °C; above this temperature its behavior was mono-exponential. Wolcan et al. claimed that thermal activation might be responsible for a transition between a coil and a rigid-rod structure, whereby the coil structure dominated in highly polar (or in highly non-polar) solvents, at temperatures below 15 °C, and the rigid-rod structure in solvents like MeCN above 15 °C.

Bottom: temperature dependence of the emission liftetimes for the monomer and the polymer in MeCN and MeCN/H2O (1∶4 mixture).

The polymer Re-I was later on investigated with respect to micelle formation and reductive redox quenching.168 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 14) and DLS experiments demonstrated that the latter polymer aggregated to form mainly spherical micelles, whose dimensions were in the range of 90 to 430 nm. Subsequent to the treatment with Cu(II) ions, the formed polymer Re-I–CuCl2 assembled into micelles that were distorted from the spherical shape, and whose dimensions were smaller than those of the micelles formed by the parent polymer (Fig. 15). Additionally, Re-I revealed reductive quenching by triethanolamine (TEOA) following a typical Stern–Volmer kinetics (Fig. 16). From the Stern–Volmer constant (KSV = 77 M−1) and the luminescence lifetime in acetonitrile, a bimolecular quenching constant of kq = 3.8 × 108 M−1 s−1 was calculated.

Similar PVP-based polymers were studied, where the Re(I) subunit bears 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) as an ancillary ligand. [Re(CO)3(phen)]+ was attached to commercial PVP600 by ligand substitution reactions of the Re(I) complexes.169,170 The polymer and the metal complex [(py)Re(CO)3phen]CF3SO3, as model substrate, were characterized by UV/vis spectroscopy exhibiting similar features. The extinction coefficient of the polymer corresponded to approximately 200 chromophores ([Re(CO)3phen]+) per polymer chain in comparison to the extinction coefficient of the monomer. Detailed photochemical investigations by flash photolysis and pulse radiolysis showed that the MLCT excited states in the polymer underwent a more efficient annihilation than in the monomer. Redox quenching experiments with the polymer by MV2+ and TEOA indicated the presence of intra-strand electron transfer processes.170 The rate constant of the latter process was dependent on the solvent used, displaying a six-time higher rate in methanol compared to that in acetonitrile.
Chan et al. were interested in Re(I)-containing block copolymers derived from polystyrene-block-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-PVP). The pyridine moieties of a PS-b-PVP diblock copolymer were used to coordinate [Re(CO)3(bpy)]+ yielding the Re(I)-functionalized block copolymers Re-II.171 The polymers were synthesized according to Scheme 19 and selected characterization parameters are summarized in Table 6. It was assumed that the metal-containing blocks were ionic in nature and that their properties were different from the hydrophobic PS block. The PS blocks aggregated in polar as well as non-polar solvents and formed micelles of different sizes and shapes, depending on the block size and the solvent system (Table 6, Fig. 16). In a mixture of toluene and CH2Cl2 the macromolecules possessed higher flexibility and experienced reduced charge repulsion. Steric effects between different Re(I) moieties became more important and, consequently, the micelles formed from polymer Re-IIb revealed a rod-like structure, which was almost 200 nm in length. By contrast, the micelles formed by polymer Re-IIa appeared to be spherical in shape (Fig. 16, right).

There are only a few examples, where Re(I) complexes of the general type [Re(CO)3L]+ (L = 1,10-phenanthroline, 2,2′-bipyridine, iminopyridines) were bound to methacrylate-based polymers. The preparation of the corresponding Re(I)-containing polymers was performed both by FRP and controlled copolymerization methods (in the latter case using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP)). In the former case, the light-emitting Re(I) complex was attached to a pre-synthesized polymer by complexation reaction between a reactive [Re(phen)(CO)3(acetone)]+ precursor and the pyridine units of the polymer side-chains.172 All polymers reported by Bignozzi et al. (Scheme 20) were characterized by conventional experimental techniques including NMR spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). UV/vis and emission spectroscopies were applied to investigate the optical properties of the polymers in solid-state films and in solution. The structure of the synthesized polymers was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and allowed the estimation of the monomer sequences in the copolymer chains. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) for the polymers were determined by DSC. The Tg is related to the permeability of the polymeric matrix towards diffusion of gases; the relatively low Tg of the rubber-like polymers depicted in Scheme 20 and time-resolved emission quenching experiments implied an application of these polymeric materials as oxygen sensors.11,173,174

In the group of Chan, Re(I)-iminopyridine and 2,2′-bipyridine complexes were successfully polymerized by ATRP. The copolymerization of MMA with different Re(I) complex/MMA ratios was demonstrated as well as the synthesis of an ABA triblock copolymer with PMMA, as macroinitiator.175 The neutral Re(I) complex in the homopolymers and copolymers was further converted into an ionic form by replacing the chloride ligand by an imidazole ligand, thereby significantly enhancing the solubility of the resulting ionic polymers. The photosensitizing properties of the polymer films were investigated by the measurement of the photocurrent response under an externally applied electric field: the photoconductivity values of the polymers containing the Re(I) iminopyridine complexes were in the range of 10−12–10−13 Ω−1 cm−1, which were comparable to the values reported for other conjugated polymers equipped with ruthenium(I) complexes as photosensitizers.176
Rhenium(I) complexes in the main-chain
π-Conjugated polymers and oligomers are of interest due to their unique optical and electronic properties, which enable their use, as an active medium, in optical, electronic, optoelectronic and chemical sensing devices. Studies of organic π-conjugated materials have established the relationship between molecular structure and the properties of the materials.177–182 Rhenium(I) diimine complexes have been incorporated into polymeric structures based on polystyrene,183 poly(methyl methacrylate),183 poly(p-phenylenevinylene)20,23,184 and polyurethane.185
However, only a few articles deal with the structure–property relationships of conjugated Re(I)-containing polymers.23,186,187 Schanze et al. selected, as targets, a series of oligo(arylene ethynylene)s (OAEs) that contained a central 2,2′-bipyridine metal chelating unit. A broad examination of the optical properties was carried out on a series of well-defined π-conjugated oligomers comprising a [Re(CO)3L]+ (L = Cl, MeCN) complex as chelating unit (Scheme 21).186–188 The bipyridine-containing oligomers were synthesized by a stepwise sequence utilizing the Pd0-catalyzed cross-coupling of a terminal acetylene and an aryl iodide (Sonogashira coupling) as the key step. The metalation with Re(I) complexes was conducted afterwards. The final compounds revealed a complex arrangement of excited states and, therefore, it was not possible to clearly interpret the influence of the π-conjugated electronic system on the MLCT excited states of the Re(I)-containing oligomers. The unmetalated oligomers 1–4 strongly absorbed throughout the near-UV into the visible region and showed remarkably similar fluorescence energies around 450 nm. The metal-containing oligomers were surprisingly dominated by π–π* transitions and their luminescence was largely quenched as revealed by transient absorption and time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy.189 Poly(arylene ethynylene)s (PPEs) functionalized with [Re(CO)3Cl]+ were synthesized by the same group utilizing Sonogashira cross-coupling, and displayed remarkable photophysical features as well (Scheme 22, Table 7).141,186,190 The excitation of Re-VII–Re-X into the π–π* absorption band revealed a strong emission (435 nm) and a bathochromically-shifted shoulder due to vibronic coupling. Because of the small Stokes-shift the emission was assigned to be fluorescence from the π–π* exciton state. The fluorescence lifetimes and quantum yields for Re-VII–Re-X decreased as the Re(I) content increased. This parallel decrease indicated that the 1π–π* exciton was quenched by the [(bpy)ReI(CO)3C1] subunits in the polymers.186

Moreover, the [Re(CO)3Cl]+ subunit was attached to 2,2′-bipyridine-based aminoalkyl-polyfluorenes yielding copolymers Re-fluI-IV with different contents of the Re(I) complex (Scheme 23). The polymer backbone was synthesized via a Suzuki cross-coupling polymerization procedure. The unmetalated aminoalkyl-polyfluorenes had good solubility in organic solvents in contrast to the Re(I)-containing copolymers, which became insoluble in most organic solvents. The optoelectronic and electroluminescent properties of these copolymers were investigated and were found to show similar performances in polymer light-emitting devices (PLEDs). Furthermore, the Re(I)-containing copolymers were used, as an electron transport layer, in a PLED leading to a general performance improvement.191Fig. 17 shows the current density–voltage characteristic and the light output from different device structures (i.e. ITO/PEDOT/PPV/Ba/Al, ITO/PEDOT/PPV/Re-fluIII (7 nm)/Ba/Al and ITO/PEDOT/PPV/Re-fluIII (10 nm)/Ba/Al; with PPV as emissive layer). By introducing a thin layer of the Re(I)-containing polymer Re-fluIII between the emissive layer and the cathode, the device performance was significantly improved. The device performance with a 7 nm-thick layer of Re-fluIII was better than with a layer thickness of 10 nm. At the same current density, the devices with the additional Re(I) layer revealed higher brightness output and luminance efficiency than the device with a pure Ba/Al cathode.

Macromolecules containing pyridine-based Ir(III) complexes
The heavy atom effect has been used in phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes for developing materials predominantly applied in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The main motivation for the synthesis of phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes was the access to more efficient OLEDs compared to fluorescent materials, because they can gather both the singlet and the triplet excitons formed during excitation. Most studies on Ir(III) complexes have focused on small molecules, which generally require high temperature/vacuum deposition techniques during the device fabrication procedure.61,192,193
So far, the incorporation of Ir(III) ions into a polymeric backbone has been investigated to a minor extent compared to the isoelectronic Ru(II) species, which was mainly owed to synthetic problems in the past. Polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) are very attractive compared to OLEDs, since such devices can be manufactured using low cost and efficient solution processing techniques, such as spin-coating or ink-jet printing.19,22,116,194–196
Polymers bearing Ir(III) complexes attached to the polymer backbone, as pendant groups, fall into two categories: the complex is connected to a conjugated polymer [e.g. polyfluorene, poly(fluorene-carbazole)], or to a polymer with a saturated, i.e. non-conjugated, backbone [e.g. poly(methacrylate), polystyrene, poly(styrene-carbazole)]. In this review, only non-conjugated polymers will be highlighted. Iridium(III) complexes attached to polyfluorenes as pendant groups,22,138,140,197–202 or as an integral part of a conjugated main-chain22,138,201–208 have been comprehensively reviewed recently.
In general, Ir(III) complexes can be divided into two classes: neutral and cationic complexes (Fig. 18). Neutral Ir(III) complexes contain three anionic ligands, which have been mostly reported in the past [thereby, mono-cyclometalating ligands (C⁁N) are the most common representatives in this respect]. In the last few years, cationic Ir(III) complexes, containing two anionic ligands and one neutral ligand (Fig. 18), have moved to the focus of interest, because they are able to offer emissive centers and ionic conductivity in the same molecule.
 Fig. 18  General structure of frequently used neutral and ionic Ir(III) complexes.194 
Schubert et al. synthesized Ir(III)-containing polymers based on polystyrene and poly(methacrylate) backbones with different mono-cyclometalating C∧N ligands. A defined copolymer (Scheme 24) bearing an acetylacetonate-type (acac) ligand was synthesized by utilizing the controlled reversible addition–fragmentation transfer (RAFT) radical polymerization technique: a dimeric hydroxy-bridged Ir(III) precursor was used to coordinate the Ir(III) chromophore to the copolymer afterwards.209 The successful coordination was confirmed by NMR, UV/vis absorption, and emission spectroscopy as well as SEC and enabled the preparation of Ir(III)-containing polymers as potential emitters for PLEDs. Furthermore, a methacrylate-functionalized phosphorescent Ir(III)-complex was copolymerized with MMA using FRP yielding polymer Ir-IIa (Scheme 24).210 Aiming for host–guest systems the complex was further copolymerized with a methacrylate-functionalized carbazole derivative by ATRP providing copolymer Ir-IIb. The optical properties of the monomers and the copolymers were investigated by absorption and emission spectroscopy in solution. The emission of the carbazole-copolymer Ir-IIb was found to be iridium-based and indicated an intra-chain energy transfer. Cationic Ir(III)-complexes were further grafted onto terpyridine-functionalized polystyrene using 2-phenylpyridine, as cyclometalating ligand [polymers Ir-III (Scheme 24)].211 Their structure and purity were investigated in detail by 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy as well as SEC. The aldehyde functionality on the cyclometalating ligand created a significant change in the emission color in solution shifting to yellow-greenish, whereas the polymer without the aldehyde functionality displayed an orange emission color. The materials were inkjet-printed on glass substrates and the film forming properties were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) with respect to the morphology. In addition, thin films of various thicknesses of the Ir(III) copolymer Ir-IIIa were effectively inkjet-printed; the absorption as well as emission intensities of the copolymers declined with decreasing film thickness in a linear fashion.116 Similar systems have been studied elsewhere212–216 revealing the successful incorporation of phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes into a polystyrene backbone and were characterized afterwards with regard to their optical properties.

Poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVC) and its derivatives are commonly used as non-conjugated host materials, since they display a good hole-transport ability and high energy singlet excited states as well as favorable film-forming properties and durability at high temperatures.194
Tokito et al. reported polymers BPP, GPP, RPP (Scheme 25) combining PVC, as hosts, and neutral Ir(III) complexes, as guests.217,218 The concentration of the Ir(III) complex in the final polymer could be controlled during the copolymerization and was varied within a range of 0.1–2.0 mol%. The molar mass was determined by SEC (Mn ≈ 16000 g mol−1, PDI: not reported). These polymers were soluble in common organic solvents and were processed from solution into films by spin-coating. The corresponding PLEDs exhibited red, green, or blue emission depending on the electronic nature of the cyclometalating ligand on the Ir(III) complexes. By employing a hole-blocking layer between the emissive layer and the cathode of the PLEDs (i.e. enhancing the recombination efficiency for the injected holes and electrons), external quantum efficiencies of 6.9% for RPP, 11% for GPP, and 6.6% for BPP were achieved.217
 Scheme 25  Schematic representation of iridium polymers based on poly(vinylcarbazole), as host material. 
Efficient blue electrophosphorescence was obtained from Ir(III) bis-[(4,6-difluorophenyl)pyridinato-N,C2′]picolinate (Irpic) that was attached to the carbazole-based polymer poly-(9-dodecyl-3-vinylcarbazole) as host (Scheme 25).219 The molar masses of the copolymers containing Irpic pendants (CPn) could be varied from 18000 to 33700 g mol−1 by utilizing FRP. The molar content of the Irpic-containing monomer units was varied between 0.8 to 10.6% (CP1: 0.8%, CP2: 2.9%, CP3: 5.3%, CP4: 10.6%). Phase segregation in the CPn copolymers was significantly suppressed and the photoluminescence spectra of the carbazole-based polymer hosts overlapped with the absorption band of the Irpic guest. Furthermore the triplet energy level of the polymer host (−2.6 eV) was higher than that of the Irpic (−3.1 eV) ensuring efficient energy transfer and resulted in highly efficient blue phosphorescence. The device of the VPP copolymer (Scheme 25) showed an external quantum efficiency of 4.4%.220
In general, the efficiency of an emitting device with a single emitting layer depends on the balance of holes and electrons. Doping with oxadiazoles, as electron transporter (ET) molecules, and triphenylamines, working as hole transporters (HT), had beneficial effects on the performance of solution-processed PLED devices.221 Incorporation of both HT and ET functionalities into copolymers featured a significant advantage over the ET-doping strategy preventing possible phase separation and crystallization of small molecular ET.
The synthesis of copolymers containing acrylic and styrenic oxadiazoles (ET), triphenylamines (HT) and functionalized β-diketone monomers by nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization (NMP) was described by Fréchet et al.222,223 Utilization of a second-generation nitroxide initiator allowed the polymerization into homo-polymers as well as random and block co- and terpolymers with predictable molar masses and relatively low PDI values (Scheme 26, Ir-IV).222 The polymers bearing HT and ET moieties were either directly used, as a matrix, for doping with luminescent molecules or were coordinated with phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes. The terpolymer Ir-IVc displayed the highest external quantum efficiency in a PLED device so far (∼10%). Moreover, the group of Fréchet designed two heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes bearing a pendant styrene substituent, which enabled a radical polymerization (Scheme 26, Ir-V).223
 Scheme 26  Schematic representation of iridium-containing nitroxide initiated terpolymers Ir-IV and Ir-V (HT = hole transport, ET = electron transport). 
The polymerizable ancillary ligands, p-tolylpyrazole styrene and p-tolylpyridine styrene, were chosen for their high triplet energies and, thus, the phosphorescent emission color was determined by the cyclometalating ligands. As a result, the phosphorescent emission color was located in the green/blue and orange/red region of the visible spectrum, respectively. The target block copolymers Ir-V could be varied within a range of 30000 to 150000 g mol−1, but the lengths of the two blocks were kept equal in order to study the morphology at different sizes. Diblock copolymers were obtained by NMP by preparing the first and the second block via a random copolymerization, consecutively. The film morphology of three white-emitting Ir-V copolymers was explored by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 19). Fig. 19a indicated a homogeneous film and no phase separation of the polymer with Mn = 30000 g mol−1. In contrast, the higher molar mass polymers (Fig. 19b and c) showed clear nanometre-sized features (lamellar morphology), which explained the suppressed energy transfer in these materials.223

Conclusions
In this review a summary of metal-containing polymers is provided focusing on the heavy d6 transition metal ions Ru(II), Os(II), Re(I) as well as Ir(III), where the polymers mainly bear the metal subunit as a pendant group. Research on these polymers is mainly concentrated on photophysical, electrochemical and material processing issues. The key polymerization techniques for the polymer synthesis are free radical polymerization (uncontrolled manner), ring-opening metathesis polymerization (controlled manner) and reversible addition–fragmentation transfer radical polymerization (controlled manner) by incorporating the metal complexes into the polymeric backbone via copolymerization and grafting techniques, respectively. The first part was dedicated to fundamentals of photophysical and photochemical processes with the intent to widen the reader's comprehension.
The incorporated Ru(II) complexes exclusively contained 4-functionalized 2,2′-bipyridines possessing additional amide-, methacrylate-, vinyl or hydroxyl-moieties, which allowed the preparation of macromolecules with Ru(II) complexes being attached to the polymer side chains. The hydroxy- and amide functionalized Ru(II) complexes were grafted onto polystyrene, whereas the amide functionalization was further exploited in ring-opening metathesis polymerization as well as a tool for Merrifield solid-phase peptide synthesis as a supplementary polymerization method. The ring-opening metathesis polymerization and the solid-phase peptide synthesis provided access to Ru(II)-containing polymers with control of the local array of added functional groups.
Osmium(II) complexes were introduced into the polymeric side chain to create redox active polymers which were capable of functioning, as a mediator, in biosensing applications (e.g. supporting electrooxidation of glucose). The Os(II) complexes enclosed 2,2′-bipyridine and bis(1H-imidazole) as chelating ligands and were grafted onto poly(4-vinylpyridine) and poly(vinylimidazole), respectively. The resulting redox polymers were applied in biosensing applications, e.g. electrooxidation of glucose. Furthermore, a library of Os(II)-containing polymers based on poly(acrylate) was established in order to evolve the optimal conditions in electron transfer reactions with a selected enzyme.
Rhenium(I) complexes were installed, as pendant groups, in the polymer side chain as well as fixed in the polymer main chain. Grafting of the [Re(CO)3bpy]+ entity to poly(4-vinylpyridine) and poly(styrene)–poly(4-vinylpyridine) block polymers led to macromolecules forming micellar aggregates in selective solvents. Furthermore, 2,2′-bipyridine as a part of the main chain of polyarylene ethynylenes and polyfluorenes, served as a coordinating element for [Re(CO)3Cl]+ chromophores. The obtained Re(I)-containing macromolecules were applied, as emissive layers, in light-emitting devices leading to a performance enhancement.
Functionalized phenylpyridine and/or bipyridine-based bidentate ligands were used to coordinate Ir(III) ions. The corresponding neutral and cationic iridium(III) complexes, respectively, were covalently introduced, as pendant groups, on the polymeric side chain and were found to have beneficial processing features in thin film light-emitting devices. In particular, further incorporation of hole and electron transporter functionalities into the iridium copolymers showed a supplementary advantage compared to the doping strategy preventing possible phase separation and crystallization.

 	Fig. 11  Electrooxidation of glucose via a high molar mass polycationic redox polymer. (a) Electrostatic interaction of a polycationic redox polymer with a polyanionic enzyme brings the redox centers at a close range for the electron transfer. Electrons are transferred to the electrode via the polymer. (b) Charge transmission and coiling of the redox polymer lead to dissociation of the electrostatic complex, stop the electron transfer, and, thereby, electrooxidize glucose. (c) After covalent bonding of the redox polymer to the enzyme the complex does not dissociate and retains the electrooxidation of glucose.144
