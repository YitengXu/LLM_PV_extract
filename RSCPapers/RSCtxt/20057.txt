    , Accepted 5th May 2022First published on 5th May 2022AbstractThe short-wavelength infrared region of the solar spectrum remains largely untapped. The development of small band gap (0.7–1.1 eV) photovoltaic devices that will complement existing photovoltaic devices can potentially add 6% power conversion efficiency points. Bismuth-alloyed antimony selenide [(BixSb1−x)2Se3] is a potentially suitable light absorber with a tunable band gap in the relevant range. This paper reports a procedure for depositing Bi-alloyed Sb2Se3 thin films through close-spaced sublimation (CSS). Continuous thin films with various Bi concentrations and alloying up to 30 at% of Bi into Sb2Se3 [Bi/(Bi + Sb) = 0.30] were prepared. The composition, structure, and optical properties of the (BixSb1−x)2Se3 thin films were characterized. A decrease in the optical band gap from 1.17 eV to 0.99 eV has been observed by Bi-alloying (x = 0.30). A three-times decrease in grain size from ∼270 nm (for x = 0.0) to ∼100 nm (for x > 0.11) has been observed. The (BixSb1−x)2Se3 thin films were tested in an FTO/ZnO/CdS/(BixSb1−x)2Se3/Au solar cell structure to find their applicability in photovoltaic devices.
1. Introduction
The theoretical power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction solar cells is limited to 33.7%, as described by the Shockley–Queisser limit.1 In comparison, by minimizing above band gap thermalization and below band gap transmission losses, a multi-junction solar cell enables higher PCEs. According to a detailed balance analysis, in a two-junction solar cell, two light absorbers with large (1.64 eV) and small (0.94 eV) band gaps can potentially transform ∼42% of the incoming solar power to electricity.2 In a triple-junction solar cell, PCE > 50% can be reached with light absorbers with band gaps of 1.83, 1.16, and 0.71 eV.
In recent years, in parallel to the surge in halide perovskite solar cells’ efficiency, a significant research effort has been directed at coupling low-cost photovoltaic (PV) technologies with large (1.6–1.8 eV) and medium (∼1.1 eV) optical absorption thresholds.3–5 However, research on devices for the short-wavelength IR region (0.7–0.95 eV) is still lagging, partly due to the limited availability of low-cost and non-toxic absorber materials. For example, Ge (Eg = 0.66 eV),6 and III–V semiconductors, such as GaSb (0.72 eV)7,8 and GaInAs,9 are current small band gap semiconductors used in triple-junction solar cells. But the deposition of III–V semiconductors through metal–organic chemical vapor deposition or molecular beam epitaxy is still too expensive for large-scale applications.10 PbS (Eg = 0.4 eV)11 and PbSe (Eg = 0.28 eV)12 are low-cost alternatives with a tunable band gap13,14 and have seen a rapid enhancement in PCE in recent years leaping from 4 × 10−5% in 200515 to 14% in 202016 (the latter for an absorber with a band gap of ∼1.13 eV). Yet, lead toxicity in these devices can potentially limit their use.
A potentially suitable material that can overcome some of the current limitations is bismuth (Bi)-alloyed antimony selenide [(BixSb1−x)2Se3]. Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) is an earth-abundant and low-toxicity emerging PV absorber material. Sb2Se3 has a high absorption coefficient (α > 105 cm−1),17 decent charge carrier mobilities (15 and 42 cm−1 V−1 s−118 for electrons and holes, respectively), and an energy band gap of ∼1.18 eV.19,20 Upon Bi-alloying, the band gap of Sb2Se3 is expected to decrease,21 and if a mixture rule is assumed, a band gap of ∼0.7 eV is expected at Bi19Sb21Se60.22 Moreover, Sb2Se3 is potentially more defect-tolerant than conventional semiconductors due to its main group chemistry and unique crystal structure.23,24 The structure of the Sb2Se3 crystal [Fig. 1(a)] consists of quasi-1-dimensional (Q1D) (Sb4Se6)n ribbons. Within the (Sb4Se6)n ribbons [i.e., along the c-axis direction in Fig. 1(a)], the atoms are covalently bonded. In the a- and b-directions, these ribbons are held together through van der Waals interactions. Electron density is confined to the ribbons, presumably making the grain boundaries in these materials electrically benign.25 In addition, the hybridization of non-bonding orbitals at the top of the valence band also makes Sb2Se3 a potentially defect-tolerant semiconductor.

(b) Two-dimensional (2D) unit cell of Sb2Se3. The crystal structures are visualized using VESTA (visualization for electronic and structural analysis) software.26 
Sb2Se3 thin films can be deposited through a variety of solution and physical processes such as hydrothermal,27,28 electrodeposition,29,30 amine–thiol-based mixtures,31,32 close-space sublimation (CSS),33,34 thermal evaporation,35,36 and vapor-transport.37–39 Yet, there are limited reports of successful deposition of Bi-alloyed Sb2Se3 thin films for PV applications.
Recently, Liu et al.21 reported the narrowing of the Sb2Se3 band gap from 1.17 eV for Sb2Se3 to 0.88 eV for BiSbSe3 [Bi(Bi + Sb) = 0.50] upon Bi-incorporation. A charge carrier density and mobility of 1.4 × 1016 cm−3 and 23.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, have been reported. Weiss et al.40 reported solar cells based on (Sb,Bi)2Se3 thin films deposited on molybdenum (Mo)-coated glass substrates. Sb, Bi and Se were evaporated in a vacuum and subsequently annealed in a tube furnace at 350 °C for 1 h. The maximum reported Bi-content without forming a secondary rhombohedral phase was Bi/(Bi + Sb) = 0.6. A decrease in the band gap from 1.149 eV for (Sb2Se3) to 0.860 eV for [Bi/(Bi + Sb) = 0.6] was observed. The reported solar cells, with a SLG/Mo/(Bi0.431Sb0.569)2Se3/CdS/i-ZnO/AZO structure, achieved a 0.7% PCE with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 132.5 mV and short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 18.4 mA cm−2.
CSS is a simple and relatively inexpensive method because it involves a relatively low operating vacuum and high growth rate. In light of recent reports of high PCE Sb2Se3 solar cells fabricated through CSS,41 it is worth considering CSS as a potential route for depositing Bi-alloyed Sb2Se3 thin films. Synthesis of various alloys with the CSS technique, such as Cd1−xZnxTe,42,43 CuGaTe2,44 Cd1−xZnxS,45 and CdSexTe1−x46 has been reported. In analogy with the above reports, and since Bi2Se3 and Sb2Se3 both have relatively high vapor pressures,47,48 we posited that (BixSb1−x)2Se3 thin film can be deposited through CSS by a direct mixture of Bi2Se3 and Sb2Se3 powders.
In the present work, we report the fabrication of (BixSb1−x)2Se3 thin film using CSS. Continuous films with various amounts of Bi were fabricated without any secondary phases. The fabricated (BixSb1−x)2Se3 films were optically and structurally characterized, and their applicability in thin film solar cell devices was tested.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3, 99.995%), antimony selenide (Sb2Se3, 99.999%), thiourea [CS(NH2), 99%], and cadmium sulphate (CdSO4, 99+ %) were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, 25%) was obtained from Bio-Lab, Israel. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass of 8–10 Ω sq−1 sheet resistance was purchased from XOP Glasses. All chemicals were used as received without any further purification.
2.2 Characterization techniques
The composition, surface morphology, and cross-section imaging of the films were done using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI nova nano SEM450) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detector (EDS, Oxford, AZtec).
For X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, a PANalytical X′Pert powder diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA) was used.
Raman scattering measurements were performed in a backscattering configuration on a system (Horiba Jobin Yvon, LabRAM HR evolution) equipped with a 785 nm wavelength laser and a 600 grooves per mm grating, which enabled a spectral resolution of ±0.8 cm−1. The spectrometer was calibrated using the standard silicon peak at 520.5 cm−1.
Room temperature diffused reflectance spectroscopy measurements were performed on a Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies). Barium sulfate (BaSO4) was used as the 100% reflectance standard.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells were recorded under simulated AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination generated by a ScienceTech AAA solar simulator and measured with an Ossila source-meter unit. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a standard silicon reference cell certified by the Newport Corporation. The solar cell devices were covered with an aperture area of 0.0256 cm2 during J–V measurements. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a ScienceTech PTS-2-QE system.
2.3 (BixSb1−x)2Se3 deposition via close-spaced sublimation
2 × 1.5 cm2 fluorine-doped tin oxide (SnO2:F, FTO)-coated soda-lime glass (SLG) substrates were cleaned with ultrasonication with an Alconox® soap solution, deionized water (18.2 Ω cm), acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 30 min each, respectively, and dried under nitrogen (N2) gas.
(BixSb1−x)2Se3 thin films were deposited using an Annealsys-Micro rapid thermal process system. Mixtures of Bi2Se3 and Sb2Se3 powders were gently ground with an Agar mortar and pestle for 1–2 min to homogenize the powders. The mixed powders were placed in a graphite boat susceptor [see schematic description in Fig. 2(a)]. A ceramic spacer and the target substrate were placed on top of the graphite boat. The distance between the Bi2Se3–Sb2Se3 powder mixture and the target substrate was 1 cm. The time-temperature profile used for the (BixSb1−x)2Se3 thin film deposition is shown in Fig. 2(b). The Bi2Se3–Sb2Se3 powder was heated to 575 °C with a ramp rate of 5 °C s−1. After holding at 575 °C for 3 to 4 minutes, the lamp power was switched off, and the system was allowed to cool naturally. During the deposition process, the chamber pressure and substrate temperature were ∼2 × 10−2 mbar and 500–465 °C, respectively.

2.4 Atomic layer deposition of ZnO
Cleaned FTO substrates were loaded into the atomic layer deposition (ALD) chamber. A 20 nm thick ZnO layer was deposited using ALD. Ar gas at a flow rate of 10 sccm was used as a carrier gas for dimethylzinc (DMZ) and deionized water. The base pressure of the deposition chamber was ∼200 mTorr, and the sample holder temperature was set to 120 °C. A single ALD cycle was executed through the following four steps: (1) 21 ms pulse of DMZ with 2.5 s of closing the expo valve was used. (2) 21 s of purge Ar gas was employed, followed by (3) 80 ms pulse of DI water with 2.5 s of closing the expo valve. (4) Ar purge for 80 s. Three hundred such cycles were used to get 20 nm thick ZnO.
2.5 Chemical bath deposition of CdS
Before CdS deposition, the ZnO deposited FTO substrate was dipped in 0.1 M Na2S solution for 3 min, followed by rinsing with DI water and dried under N2.49 Following Na2S treatment, the substrate was immersed in a bath solution containing 0.02 M CdSO4 (2 mL), 25% NH4OH (1.5 mL), 1 M CS(NH2)2 (3.4 mL) and deionized (DI) water (13.1 mL) for 5 min. The bath temperature was maintained at 60 °C. After the deposition, the CdS-coated substrate was immediately rinsed with deionized water and dried under a nitrogen flow.
2.6 Gold deposition
For gold deposition, samples with a suitable shadow mask were loaded in a thermal evaporator (Moorfield's nanoPVD). During the gold evaporation, the base pressure was 1 × 10−6 mbar. 80 nm of gold was deposited with a deposition rate of 0.5–2 Å s−1.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Microstructure and composition of the thin films
The nominal concentration at the source (xtarget) and the measured [xexp = Bi/(Bi + Sb)] metal ratios are plotted in Fig. 3 and summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). From here onwards, (BixSb1−x)2Se3 thin films will be quoted by the observed Bi-content in the film, xexp. From Fig. 3, it can be seen that the incorporated Bi concentration is ∼10 times lower than the amount present in the source Bi2Se3/Sb2Se3 powder mixture. This is expected since, at the evaporation temperature (575 °C), the vapor pressure of Bi2Se3 (0.02 mbar) is lower than the vapor pressure of Sb2Se3 (0.3 mbar).47,48 Nonetheless, Bi/(Bi + Sb) values of up to 0.3 were measured in the deposited films.
 Fig. 3  Plots of the targeted (xtarget) and experimentally achieved Bi-content [xexp = Bi/(Bi + Sb)]. The right axis is the experimentally estimated Se/(Bi + Sb) composition ratio. 
In addition, up to xtarget = 0.3, the Se/(Bi + Sb) ratio was slightly above 1.5 [the Se/(Bi + Sb) stoichiometric ratio], and then decreased to less than 1.5. When xtarget = 1 was used (only Bi2Se3), the Se/(Bi + Sb) was ∼1.66 ± 0.09. We suggest that the observed Se deficiency at higher xtarget is due to the vapor/solid reaction stoichiometry of the two components in the Bi2Se3/Sb2Se3 powder mixture (i.e., at the evaporation source): (1) (2) (3) (4)
According to reactions (1) and (2), and the corresponding temperature-vapor pressure relations of each component [eqn (3) and (4)], a Sb2Se3-rich source will have a higher partial pressure of Se2 than a Bi2Se3-rich source for the same temperature.
The XRD patterns of the CSS-deposited thin films (Fig. 4) confirm the formation of phase pure orthorhombic Sb2Se3 (xexp = xtarget = 0; JCPDS no. 015-0861) or rhombohedral Bi2Se3 (xexp = xtarget = 1; JCPDS no. 033-0214; plotted for reference). The intensity peaks for xexp = 0 at 28.20, 31.16, and 32.22 degrees correspond to (211), (221), and (301) planes of the (hkl) family, and the intensity peaks at 14.96, 16.80, and 27.35 degrees correspond to (020), (120) and (230) planes of (hk0) family. The calculated texture coefficient (TC; ESI,† S2) reveals a TC > 1 for the (211) and (301) planes and a TC < 1 for the (hk0) family of planes, which suggests that the deposited films (xexp = 0) had a preferred orientation of (hk1) planes.

The peaks at 26.58, 33.77, 37.77, and 51.76 degrees correspond to tin oxide (JCPDS no. 077-0452), which comes from the underneath FTO substrate. (b), (c) and (d) are the XRD for the diffraction angles between 13.5 and 18.50, 27 and 29, and 30 and 30.5 degrees, respectively. The peaks corresponding to the planes (020), (120), and (230) show no shift, while the peaks corresponding to the (211), (221), and (301) planes show a shift toward lower diffraction angles with increased Bi-content. (e) A plot of the FWHM of the X-ray diffraction peak from the (221) plane at 31.13 degree and the corresponding interplanar spacing (d) for different Bi contents in the (BixSb1−x)2Se3 films. (f) A plot between strain and Bi-content in the film. The detailed procedure is described in ESI,† S3. 
Upon Bi-incorporation, the orthorhombic phase was maintained. However, while the diffraction peaks corresponding to (211), (221), and (301) belonging to the (hk1) family show a shift towards a lower diffraction angle, the diffraction peaks corresponding to (020), (120), and (230) belonging to the (hk0) family showed no apparent shift [Fig. 4(b)–(d)].
The shift in the intensity peaks means that the inter-planer spacing has increased upon Bi-incorporation. Fig. 4(e) shows a plot of estimated inter-planer spacing (d) and full-width at half maximum (FWHM) for the (221) plane estimated from the XRD peaks for various Bi-contents. The increase in d-spacing upon increasing Bi-content is understandable as the Bi–ions (0.90 Å) are larger than the Sb–ions (0.76 Å).50 Therefore, the substitution of Sb by Bi should cause an increase in the lattice d spacing (and correspondingly the XRD peaks shift), as we observed. The selective shift of the peaks belonging to the (hk1) family indicates that the Bi–ions are incorporated preferentially in specific sites.

Fig. 4(f) shows the plot of estimated strain in the film for various amounts of Bi. The strain values are calculated using the Williamson–Hall method51 (the procedure adopted is described in ESI,† S3). Surprisingly, it was observed that the strain in the films decreased upon Bi-incorporation even though the d-spacing had increased. Moreover, films xexp = 0.07, 0.20, and 0.30 have strain values negative or close to zero, which means that in these films, the broadening of the XRD peaks is not dominated by the strain, rather by the small crystallite domains in the films.52

Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectra of the (BixSb1−x)2Se3 thin films probed using a 785 nm laser for excitation. The peaks in the Sb2Se3 spectrum at 80, 116, 152, and 190 cm−1 are attributed to the Ag7, Ag5, B2g1, and Ag2 phonon modes.53,54 In the Bi2Se3 spectrum (see Fig. S4, ESI†), the three peaks at 72, 130, and 175 cm−1 correspond to the A1g1, E2g2, and A1g2 symmetry and matches well with the reported values.55,56
 Fig. 5  Compositional dependence of the Raman spectra for BixSb2−xSe3 films for gradually increasing amounts of Bi-alloying denoted by the Bi/(Bi + Sb) ratio (xexp). 
We observed that the peak intensity at 190 cm−1 (corresponding to Sb–Se–Sb vibrations57,58) decreased upon increasing the Bi-content. In comparison, a shoulder appeared at ∼176 cm−1, which upon further increasing the Bi-content, shifted to smaller wavenumbers and its intensity increased (Fig. 5). At the same time, the intensity of the peak at 152 cm−1 (corresponding to Sb–Sb vibrations59,60) decreased, and a small peak at ∼125 cm−1 emerged. This result is understandable because, for an AB compound, the zone-center optical phonon frequency can be expressed as ,61 where αA–B and μA–B are the bond-stretching force constant and reduced mass (), respectively. The bond-stretching force constant depends upon the bond length (α = α0·d−β). Here, α0 and β are constants, and d is the bond length.60 Therefore, if the bond length increases, the bond-stretching force constant decreases, which will cause a decrease in the phonon frequency. Therefore, since the Bi–Se bond is longer than the Sb–Se bond,62,63 and the mass of the Bi–ions is larger than that of Sb, the optical phonon frequency is expected to shift to lower wavenumbers, as we observed. Based on the XRD and Raman spectroscopy results, we conclude that (BixSb1−x)2Se3 alloys were successfully formed through CSS.

Fig. 6 shows the SEM micrographs from top and cross-sectional views of CSS-deposited (BixSb1−x)2Se3 thin films with various amounts of Bi. The Sb2Se3 film (xexp = 0) had an average grain size of 270 ± 21 nm, which decreased to 106 ± 11 nm for xexp = 0.11 (a brief description of the method adopted for the estimation of crystallite size is given in ESI,† S3). A possible explanation for the reduction in grain size could be that Bi2Se3 has a higher melting point temperature (700 °C) than that of Sb2Se3 (605 °C).64 Therefore, it can be expected that the grain growth in Bi2Se3 will take place at a higher temperature than in Sb2Se3. As a result, at a given temperature, increasing the Bi-amount in Sb2Se3 leads to an apparent decrease in the grain size.
 Fig. 6  Top and cross-sectional FESEM micrographs of the (BixSb1−x)2Se3 thin films with various Bi contents. Insets are higher magnification of the thin films. False colors were added in the cross-sectional micrographs to aid in the visualization of the different layers: the light blue colored layer is (BixSb1−x)2Se3, and the light green colored layer is FTO. 
We also observed that films with a higher Bi-content were thinner. For example, the film thickness decreased from ∼730 nm for xexp = 0 to ∼110 nm for xexp = 0.11, respectively (Fig. 6), for the same deposition process duration. The decrease in the film thickness with increasing Bi-content could be explained by the difference in vapor pressure of the materials. At a given temperature, the Bi2Se3 vapor pressure is lower (0.02 mbar at 575 °C) than the Sb2Se3 vapor pressure (0.3 mbar at 575 °C). Therefore, relatively less Bi2Se3 evaporates at a given temperature than Sb2Se3, causing the observed reduction in film thickness with an increasing amount of Bi.
A comparison between the estimated crystallite size from SEM micrographs and grain size from XRD is shown in Fig. 7. The crystallite size is smaller than the grain size, which indicates that a typical grain in (BixSb1−x)2Se3 thin films consists of smaller crystallites. Nevertheless, the trend is similar for both grain and crystallite size, which decreases in size with an increasing amount of the Bi. It could also be noticed from the plots in Fig. 7 that the average grain size of the xexp = 0.13, 0.22, and 1.00 films is larger than that of the xexp = 0.11 film. The larger grain size for xexp > 0.11 is because these films are grown for four minutes (to get a sufficient film thickness), while the rest were grown for three minutes. Since, during the growth, films with xexp > 0.11 are held at a higher temperature (500–465 °C) and for a longer duration than films deposited at xexp < 0.11, this presumably leads to an increase in the grain size.

3.2 Optical characterization
The band gaps of the various films were determined from the diffused reflectance spectra using the Kubelka–Munk (KM) function (ESI† S5). The extracted band gaps from the KM plots for n = 2 and n = 1/2 with respect to Bi-content are plotted in Fig. 8 (a). Here, n = 2 and 1/2 corresponds to indirect and direct transition. A decrease in band gap (for both n = 2 and n = 1/2) was observed upon increasing Bi-content. The band gap decreased from 1.17 eV for xexp = 0.0 to 0.99 eV for xexp = 0.30. The trendline of the observed band gaps drawn in Fig. 8 is in line with the band gap values reported by other groups21,40 for the composition ratio of x = 0.5.
 Fig. 8  (a) Plots of band gap variation for different amounts of Bi-incorporation. The band gap values are extracted from the KM plots (ESI† S6) for n = 2 and n = 1/2. The band gap values from ref. 24 and 39 are also shown in the plot. (b) The two-dimensional crystal structures of Bi-incorporated Sb2Se3. The Sb1 atoms have been replaced with Bi atoms. (c) Orbital energies of Sb, Bi, and Se are taken from ref. 65. 
Several groups66–68 have calculated the band structures of Sb2Se3 and reported that the density of state at the top of the valence band is due to Se-4p and Sb-5p states, with the main contribution stemming from Se-4p states. Similarly, the bottom of the conduction band has a dominant contribution from Sb-5p states with a smaller contribution from Se-4p states. Upon replacement of Sb–ions with Bi–ions [Fig. 8(b)], the additional Bi-6p states, which have a smaller εp [Fig. 8(c)] are expected to add states at the top of the valence band. Therefore, on Bi-alloying, the valence band edge will shift upwards, leading to a decrease in the optical band gap, as we observed.
3.4 Solar cell device characterization
To demonstrate the utility of the CSS-deposited (BixSb1−x)2Se3 films, the various films were incorporated into an FTO/ZnO/CdS/(BixSb1−x)2Se3/Au PV device structure. A schematic of the solar cell along with its performance parameters is shown in Fig. 9 and summarized in Table S6 (ESI†). A trend of increase in Jsc and a decrease in Voc is seen with an increased Bi-incorporation. This is expected due to the observed reduction in the optical band gap. The onset of the normalized external-quantum efficiency (EQE) of the Bi-incorporated cells [Fig. 9(c)] shows a shift towards a longer wavelength with increasing Bi-content, further confirming the narrowing of the band gap.

(c) Normalized EQE curves of the solar cells with different Bi-contents show the shift in the EQE edge due to the reduction in the band gap. (d)–(g) are the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill-factor (FF), and power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cell for different amounts of Bi-alloying in Sb2Se3. Thin films with higher contents of Bi (i.e., xexp > 0.06) did not show photovoltaic effects. The detailed performance parameters are given in ESI† S6. 
The photovoltaic device results show that further optimization of all solar cell component properties is needed. Nonetheless, high short circuit current densities can be obtained even with a non-optimized device.
4. Conclusions
Bi-alloying into Sb2Se3 has been successfully achieved using a close-spaced sublimation technique. Bi-incorporation into Sb2Se3 has been found to strongly influence the film grain size. A reduction in the optical band gap to ∼0.99 eV has been successfully achieved. The applicability of the prepared (BixSb1−x)2Se3 thin films in solar cell architecture has been demonstrated. The currently developed CSS technique has the potential to tune the optical band gap of the Sb2Se3 (via Bi-incorporation) to achieve a smaller band gap for infrared region applications.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Sb2Se3 crystal structure showing Sb4Se6 ribbon within the ribbon Sb and Se are covalently bonded and have weak van der Waals interactions with the adjacent ribbon. (b) Two-dimensional (2D) unit cell of Sb2Se3. The crystal structures are visualized using VESTA (visualization for electronic and structural analysis) software.26	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Schematic of a close spaced sublimation system used for the synthesis of (BixSb1−x)2Se3 thin films. (b) A typical time-temperature heating profile used for the synthesis of (BixSb1−x)2Se3 thin films.	 

 	Fig. 3  Plots of the targeted (xtarget) and experimentally achieved Bi-content [xexp = Bi/(Bi + Sb)]. The right axis is the experimentally estimated Se/(Bi + Sb) composition ratio.

 	Fig. 4  (a) XRD patterns of the (BixSb1−x)2Se3 thin film deposited using the CSS method. The standard XRD patterns of Sb2Se3 (JCPDS no. 015-0861) and Bi2Se3 (033-0214) are also shown as references. The peaks at 26.58, 33.77, 37.77, and 51.76 degrees correspond to tin oxide (JCPDS no. 077-0452), which comes from the underneath FTO substrate. (b), (c) and (d) are the XRD for the diffraction angles between 13.5 and 18.50, 27 and 29, and 30 and 30.5 degrees, respectively. The peaks corresponding to the planes (020), (120), and (230) show no shift, while the peaks corresponding to the (211), (221), and (301) planes show a shift toward lower diffraction angles with increased Bi-content. (e) A plot of the FWHM of the X-ray diffraction peak from the (221) plane at 31.13 degree and the corresponding interplanar spacing (d) for different Bi contents in the (BixSb1−x)2Se3 films. (f) A plot between strain and Bi-content in the film. The detailed procedure is described in ESI,† S3.	 

 	Fig. 5  Compositional dependence of the Raman spectra for BixSb2−xSe3 films for gradually increasing amounts of Bi-alloying denoted by the Bi/(Bi + Sb) ratio (xexp).	 

 	Fig. 6  Top and cross-sectional FESEM micrographs of the (BixSb1−x)2Se3 thin films with various Bi contents. Insets are higher magnification of the thin films. False colors were added in the cross-sectional micrographs to aid in the visualization of the different layers: the light blue colored layer is (BixSb1−x)2Se3, and the light green colored layer is FTO.	 

 	Fig. 7  Plots of grain size and crystallite size estimated from the SEM micrographs and XRD patterns, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) Plots of band gap variation for different amounts of Bi-incorporation. The band gap values are extracted from the KM plots (ESI† S6) for n = 2 and n = 1/2. The band gap values from ref. 24 and 39 are also shown in the plot. (b) The two-dimensional crystal structures of Bi-incorporated Sb2Se3. The Sb1 atoms have been replaced with Bi atoms. (c) Orbital energies of Sb, Bi, and Se are taken from ref. 65.	 

 	Fig. 9  (a) Schematic of the (BixSb1−x)2Se3 solar cell device configuration. (b) J–V curves of the best solar cell device. (c) Normalized EQE curves of the solar cells with different Bi-contents show the shift in the EQE edge due to the reduction in the band gap. (d)–(g) are the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill-factor (FF), and power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cell for different amounts of Bi-alloying in Sb2Se3. Thin films with higher contents of Bi (i.e., xexp > 0.06) did not show photovoltaic effects. The detailed performance parameters are given in ESI† S6.
