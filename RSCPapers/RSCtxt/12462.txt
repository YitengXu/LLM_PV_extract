Broader context
Clean energy conversion is crucial to sustain the rapid development of human society and mitigate the greenhouse effect and environmental pollution from fossil fuels. Practical utilization of clean energies requires energy conversions involving different processes such as photovoltaics (PV, from solar energy to electrical energy), electrocatalysis (EC, from electrical energy to chemical energy), and photocatalysis (PC, from solar energy to chemical energy). A key issue to realize a high-efficiency conversion process is to find stable, low-cost and environment-friendly functional materials. Due to their extreme structural and compositional flexibilities, oxide perovskites and their derivatives are attractive candidates for the diverse applications aforementioned. This paper reviews the structural and compositional flexibility of oxide perovskites and their derivatives and the progress of their applications in clean energy conversion. It attempts to describe how the properties of oxide perovskites and their derivatives are tuned for specific applications.

1. Introduction
The rapidly growing global demand for energy and extensive concerns about the greenhouse effect and environmental pollution from fossil energy production have stimulated intensive research interest in the generation of sustainable and clean energies and new electrochemical energy storage systems.1–13 Converting solar energy to electricity or chemical fuels represents the forefront of renewable energy research. Whereas photovoltaics (PV) uses semiconductors to absorb sunlight and directly convert solar energy into electricity, eletrocatalysis (EC) uses electrons to reduce water or CO2 to generate valuable clean and storable H2 or CO, alcohols and hydrocarbon fuels. Photocatalysis (PC) including photoelectrochemical (PEC) catalysis and non-PEC photocatalysis14,15 further employs semiconductors to absorb sunlight to create charge pairs for realizing water splitting and CO2 reduction. Fuel cells and metal–air batteries use EC to reduce earth-abundant oxygen at the cathode and evolve oxygen at the anode for generating electricity.8,16
Before large-scale applications can be realized, several key challenges must be overcome, including high-cost, poor stability and sluggish performance of catalysts as well as weak absorption of photoabsorbers. For instance, the lack of low-cost electrocatalysts consisting of earth-abundant elements with superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability compared to the current noble metal catalysts, IrO2 and RuO2, hinders the practical application of water splitting on a large scale.17 The commercialization of metal–air batteries is hindered by the high-cost, high overpotential and low rate-capacity of platinum catalysts, as well as the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode.8 As for CO2 reduction, the electrochemical production of C2 or C3 (such as ethylene, ethanol and n-propanol) fuels is still not able to compete with chemical synthesis processes.18 To date, few n-type photoanodes have demonstrated long-term and efficient oxygen production for PEC water oxidation. Most non-oxide n-type semiconductors are chemically unstable in aqueous solutions and form thick oxide layers that block the OER. The more promising materials for producing stable and oxidation-resistant photoanodes are metal oxides. Unfortunately, none of the current existing metal oxides have demonstrated high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies under visible light irradiation, although many of them are stable in aqueous solutions and are resistant to oxidation. This underperformance is due largely to the fact that most metal oxides have too large bandgaps to effectively absorb the main portion of the sunlight spectrum, i.e., visible light.19–21 While EC and PC involve functional materials for the OER, ORR, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), PV usually does not involve chemical reactions.
Recently, extensive efforts have been made to address the aforementioned issues through developing new functional materials. Since the energy conversion processes in different technologies are different, the functional materials used in these technologies require rather different material properties. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that a class of materials, namely, oxide perovskites and their derivatives,17,19–24 can be used in all these technologies, reflecting their versatile properties. Additionally, oxide perovskites exhibit several other attractive properties25,26 including superconductivity, ferroelectricity, magnetoresistance and ionic conductivity, owing to their structural and compositional flexibility. Recently, halide perovskites have attracted global interest in PV applications27–30 due to their superior photovoltaic properties such as extremely high optical absorption coefficient, super long carrier diffusion length and low-temperature solution processability. However, the practical use of halide perovskites in these technologies is rather challenging due to their instabilities to moisture, temperature, and the environment. In contrast, oxide perovskites and their derivatives have exhibited broader applications in EC, PC, and PV owing to their superior stability. Here, we provide a review on the structural and compositional flexibility of oxide perovskites and their derivatives and the status of their applications in EC (i.e. OER, ORR, HER and CO2RR), PC and PV. The challenges and future prospects will also be discussed.
2. Structural and compositional flexibility of oxide perovskites
2.1 Structural flexibility

2.1.1 Single perovskites. 
Perovskites with a general formula ABX3, in which A and B are large electropositive cations and X is an anion, have the structure shown at the center of Fig. 1. The ideal oxide perovskite ABO3 has a cubic structure with a high symmetry of Pmm, comprising a highly flexible framework built up from chains of corner-sharing [BO6] octahedra and A cations occupying the resulting holes with cuboctahedra symmetry. A cubic phase is usually observed at high temperatures above 1000 K for oxide perovskites.32 When the temperature goes down, cubic perovskites undergo octahedral rotations along their symmetry axes ([100], [010], [001]) and change to lower-symmetry phases.33,34 To have a complete picture of perovskite tilt, Glazer developed a method to describe the octahedral tilting in perovskites in the 1970s35i.e., combining the rotations along the three orthogonal symmetry axes of the octahedra. At that time, twenty-three kinds of crystal structures for tilt perovskites were identified, while further group theory analysis led to only fifteen unique tilt patterns36 as shown in Table 2. A comprehensive literature survey37 showed that 90% single oxide perovskites adopt only four kinds of Glazer tilt, corresponding to four common phases as shown in Table 3.
 Fig. 1  The structural flexibility of oxide perovskites. From single cubic perovskite (center) to double cubic perovskite with the B-site ordering of rock-salt, random and layered structures (see Table 1 for detailed information). Through [BO6] octahedral tilt, cubic phases can transform to different tilted phases with three dominating ones shown on the bottom left. Under large distortion of [BO6] octahedra, the three-dimensional (3D) connection of octahedra can be broken, leading to 2D and 1D perovskite derivatives.

2.1.2 Double perovskites. 
Double perovskites describe the perovskites with the A or B site occupied by two different types of cations, giving the formulas of A′A′′B2O6 (double A-site) or A2B′B′′O6 (double B-site). Since A-site cations usually act as an electron donor to the [BO6] framework and the physical properties of ABO3 perovskites are highly dependent on B-site cations, double perovskites usually indicate double B-site perovskites. Hereafter, ‘perovskite/double perovskite’ indicates ‘oxide perovskite/oxide double perovskite’ unless specifically stated otherwise.
The crystal structure of a double perovskite A2B′B′′O6 is determined by the arrangement of B′ and B′′ cations in the B sublattice. Due to the charge (size) difference between B′ and B′′ cations, the Madelung (strain) energy of double perovskites A2B′B′′O6 can be reduced by the particular ordering on the B-site. There are mainly three kinds of B-cation sublattice31 including random, rock salt and layered structures as shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1. The types of arrangements are generally determined by the charge difference (ΔQ) between B′ and B′′. Based on the existing double perovskites, the random order dominates when ΔQ = 1, but the rock-salt order dominates when ΔQ > 2. This could be explained by larger Madelung energy for random order for a larger ΔQ. Since ΔQ >= 2 in most of the double perovskites, the rock-salt order accounts for the majority of double perovskites.
In rock-salt order, the crystal symmetries of double perovskites are reduced compared to their corresponding single perovskites due to the difference of B ions. For example, the Pmm symmetry of single perovskite is reduced to Fmm symmetry in double perovskites, as shown in Table 3. A literature survey33 showed that, the same four kinds of Glazer tilt seen in single perovskite also dominate in double perovskites. The corresponding crystal symmetries of dominating single and double perovskite phases are shown in Table 3 with their crystal structures shown in Fig. 1.


2.1.3 Perovskite derivatives – one- and two-dimensional structures. 
Although the octahedral tilting can break the centrosymmetry, which is critical for ferroelectricity, its effects on the energy conversion process are still unclear. Recent calculations of electronic structures19 on five common tilted phases of eighteen oxide double perovskites showed that the bandgaps resulting from different tilts can vary by up to 0.2 eV, which is slightly larger than those found in organic–inorganic halide perovskites, for example, CH3NH3PbI3.38
When the distortion is large enough, some of the B–O bonds and therefore the three-dimensional (3D) [B–O] framework can break, resulting in one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) perovskite derivatives, which can be considered as low-dimensional perovskites as classified by the spatial arrangements of the octahedral units with their crystal structures depicted in Fig. 1. In 1D perovskites, the [BO6] octahedra can be corner-sharing, edge-sharing, or face-sharing to form a 1D nanowire with a linear or zigzag configuration.39 2D perovskites typically consist of stacked layers with mainly edge-sharing octahedra.40 These low dimensional perovskite derivatives have much higher surface to bulk ratios than their 3D counterparts, and therefore, are more suitable for applications in catalysis.

2.2 Compositional flexibility

2.2.1 Stoichiometric single perovskites. 
Although perovskite was originally named for CaTiO3, it was found that many different cations with diverse oxidation states and steric sizes can have similar crystal structures. Fig. 2 highlights all the elements in the periodic table that have appeared on A or B sites in oxide perovskites available in experimental data. There are 32/54 kinds of elements that have been found at the A/B site with diverse oxidation states ranging from 1+ to 7+ and a wide range of ionic radii of 0.76 Å (Li1+)–1.52 Å (K1+) for A and 0.45 Å (Be2+)–1.52 Å (K1+) for B, exhibiting large flexibility of compositions that can form the crystal structure of perovskites.
 Fig. 2  Compositional flexibility of single and double oxide perovskites. A- and B-site cations are marked according to the existing single and double oxide perovskites. The bottom figure shows the ideal amount (green bar) and experimentally synthesized amount (pink bar) of oxide perovskites categorized by difference combinations of cation oxidation states. The considered oxidation states ranging from 1+ to 8+ are listed in Table 4. 
In principle, the single perovskite ABO3 can be divided into five groups, A1+B5+O3, A2+B4+O3, A3+B3+O3, A4+B2+O3 and A5+B1+O3, according to different combinations of oxidation states of A and B cations. All cations with possible oxidation state ranging from 1+ to 8+ are listed in Table 4. In theory, there are 2346 kinds of ABO3 and at least 265 of them have been experimentally synthesized. Their respective numbers in each group are shown in Fig. 2. There are still a large number of single perovskites that have not been experimentally synthesised.

2.2.2 Stoichiometric double perovskites. 
An important feature of double perovskites A2B′B′′O6 is that the structure has extremely large tolerance to different elemental combinations of (B′, B′′). To maintain the charge balance, A2B′B′′O6 must satisfy the following equation: 2·QA + QB′ + QB′′ = 12(1)Based on Fig. 2 and Table 4, there are about 105 double perovskite candidates. A survey of the literature on double perovskites shows that there are more than 103 double perovskites that have been experimentally synthesized since the 1950s.32,33,41 Such a large number of double perovskites, with many of them not having been extensively studied yet as shown in Fig. 2, provides a treasure trove of materials for a wide range of applications.


2.2.3 Perovskite derivatives. 
The compositional flexibility of 3D perovskites can also be carried to 2D and 1D derivatives. Different cations may occupy the B site (octahedral center) to engineer 1D and 2D perovskites. For example, some of the Ni ions in layered double hydroxides (LDHs), Ni(OH)2, can be substituted by Fe ions yielding (Ni–Fe LDH) 2D perovskites17,75,76 with the same 2D structure as Ni(OH)2.


2.2.4 Beyond chemical stoichiometry. 
The compositional flexibility of perovskites is also reflected by the ease of alloying on both A and B sites. Table 5 lists some of the perovskite alloys reported in the recent literature for applications in EC, PC and PV. It has been observed that the alloy site can be on either the A or B site or both. For normal alloys in semiconductors, the mixing elements are usually isovalent, such as CuInxGa1−xSe2 and Cu2ZnSnS4−xSex. In contrast, the mixing elements in perovskites can be nonisovalent, for example, (La1.8Ca0.2)(Mg0.9Ti1.1)O6, where Ca2+ and La3+ are on the A site and Mg2+ and Ti4+ are on the B′ site. The ease of cation mixing in perovskites offers great opportunities for tuning the physical and chemical properties for desirable device applications. For example, the occupation of the ionic d orbital on the B-site can be tuned by mixing transition metal ions with different valence charges, which can be used to improve the EC for chemical reactions as to be discussed in Section 3.1.

The structural and compositional flexibility also include that the structural framework of perovskites, i.e. the corner-sharing [BO6] octahedra, can be maintained in the presence of a large number of ionic vacancies, including A, B and O vacancies. In the extreme case, the A site can be completely unoccupied, leading to the structure of ReO3 and WO3. In these structures, the empty A sites have large voids that can easily accept additional ions to form A-site-deficient perovskites AWO3,77 such as LixWO3 (x = 0–0.50), and NaxWO3 (x = 0–0.11 and 0.41–0.95). Such kinds of A-site-deficient perovskites have also been found in titanates, niobates and tantalates, such as La2/3TiO3, Ln1/3NbO3 and Ln1/3NbO3. The wide cation deficiency range of AxWO3 offers potential for them to act as anode materials in Li-ion or Na-ion batteries.78 Apart from A-site deficiency, perovskite structures can also accommodate a high density of oxygen vacancies, as shown in Table 5. In an extreme case, one O ion could be lost in one formula unit of double perovskites to form ordered-O-vacancy perovskites such as Cs2FeAlO5, also called brownmillerites.79 The high oxygen deficiency and high mobility of oxygen vacancy in perovskites such as Sr2Mg1−xMnxMoO6−δ makes them suitable as anode materials in solid-oxide fuel cells,16 which require fast oxygen diffusion for chemical reaction. In fact, many functional perovskites contain oxygen vacancies, such as ferroelectric perovskites [KNbO3]1−x[BaNi1/2Nb1/2O3−δ]x for photovoltaics22 (Section 3.3) and Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ for EC in OER42 (Section 3.1.1), although the effects of oxygen vacancies are not fully understood.

3. Applications in EC, PC, and PV
The flexibilities of perovskite structures and compositions have enabled versatile applications of this class of materials in energy production and storage devices. In this section, we summarize recent results of their applications in EC, PC and PV. The key material properties required for these applications will be discussed. The structure–property–application relationship of perovskites provides guidance for future material design to overcome current challenges.
3.1 Electrocatalysis
Catalysis is crucial for the production of most industrially important chemicals. In a fundamental aspect, catalysis is the increase in the chemical reaction rate with the existence of the catalyst.80 Electrocatalysis is a catalysis process aided by electricity, which can also be considered as converting electrical energy to chemical energy. Fig. 3 shows the types of applications of oxide perovskites and derivatives in chemical and electrochemical reactions. The results of the state-of-the-art perovskite electrocatalysts are summarized in Table 6.

3.1.1 Single perovskites. 
The studies on the single perovskites as oxygen electrocatalysts were firstly reported during the early 1970s.107 Meadwcroft examined the EC activity of several single oxide perovskites.107 Among them, LaCoO3 showed promising performance in a base and Sr or Ni doping was found to improve the conductivity to 102 Ω cm−1. The early study of trivalent Ni-containing perovskites LaNiO2.84 for the ORR suggested the feasibility of σ* bond formation between the eg orbital of the transition metal ion and molecular orbital of adsorbate, which is important for EC activity. In addition, the conductivity of oxide perovskite is strongly correlated with the oxygen vacancies, which further affects the catalytic activities.108 Several other 3d-transition metal-containing perovskites (e.g., LaVO3, LaMnO3, SrFeO3, etc.)84,109 have been studied for OER/ORR in a base. For instance, the ORR activities of LnMnO3 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, Yb, or Y) were studied in 8.0 M KOH with similar surface areas.110 It was found that the activities decreased with the decrease in the ionic radius of the A-site cation (La > Pr > Nd > Sm > Gd > Y > Dy > Yb). Both the tolerance factor and symmetry increase with the increase of A-site cation radius. Therefore, La3+, with the largest ionic radius in the series, tends to form the highly symmetric cubic or rhombohedral phases, while Pr3+ and Nd3+, with smaller ionic radius, tend to form the orthorhombic or tetragonal phases. The crystal structures are strongly correlated with the electrocatalytic activities, due to the distortion of the [BO6] octahedra, and therefore also indirectly influence the ORR/OER activity.110
Sunarso et al.111 investigated the ORR activities of LaMO3 (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) in 0.1 M KOH. The results indicated a descending order (Co > Mn > Ni > Fe > Cr) in diffusion-limited ORR current density. Zhu et al.112 studied the EC activities of LaMO3 (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) perovskite nanoparticles for both ORR and OER. LaMnO3 was found to have the best bifunctional activities for both OER and ORR, followed by LaCoO3 and LaFeO3, whereas LaCoO3 exhibited better stability than LaMnO3. Hardin et al.83 examined LaMO3 (M = Ni, Co, and Mn) with pure perovskite phases. The results indicate that LaCoO3 has the lowest overpotential of 1.64 VRHE at 10 mA cm−2 (OER), and 0.64 VRHE at −3 mA cm−2 (ORR) in 0.1 M KOH. In addition, their work also suggested strong performance dependence on the formation energies of oxygen vacancies.
To further understand the mechanism, a number of descriptors have been proposed to guide new material design. For instance, Man et al.113 calculated the adsorption energies of HOO* vs. HO* to analyze the reaction free energy diagrams of OER electrocatalysts. The scaling relation led to an approximately constant difference between the binding energies of HOO* and HO*, which in turn defined the lowest possible theoretical overpotential for the OER on a wide variety of oxides. Based on that, they introduced a single descriptor (ΔGO* − ΔGHO*) to evaluate the EC activity. When thermodynamic overpotentials are plotted with this descriptor, a volcano plot was obtained. The oxide on the very top of the volcano shows better performance than its beneath counterparts (Fig. 4), and two different slopes indicate two different rate-determining steps. Oxides on the left-hand branch mean too strong binding with adsorbates, while oxides on the right-hand branch indicate too weak binding. This behavior is typically referred as to the Sabatier principle. Although the Sabatier principle can well explain the activity trend of oxide perovskites, it is difficult to predict novel catalysts with enhanced activity. In addition, the proposed mechanism using this descriptor is based on four-electron reaction paths, and the actual reaction path may differ.

The low coverage regime was considered and the calculated values were used to show the activity of each oxide. The volcano curve was established by using the scaling relation between  and .

3.1.2 Double perovskites. 
In order to tune the effective eg orbital, Co, Fe and V were introduced into LaNiO3 to partially substitute Ni in the early 1970s, leading to double perovskite electrocatalysts.108 Here, the notation of double perovskite is extended to compositions with the atomic ratios of A′/A′′ and B′/B′′ beyond 1:1. These double perovskites may also be called perovskite alloys. The results indicated that the overlap integral of the eg and O 2p orbital was the descriptor of EC activity. A larger overlap integral corresponds to a higher EC activity. Other 3d-transition metal-containing double perovskites were reported for oxygen electrocatalysis by partially replacing B-site cations. For instance, a systematic examinations of 14 perovskites for OER revealed a descending order: La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 > La0.76Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3 > La0.83Ca0.15Mn0.6Co0.4O3 > La0.6Sr0.4FeO3 > La0.74Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3 > La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Cu0.1Fe0.7O3 > La0.75Sr0.2Mn0.9Co0.1O3 > La0.97Mn0.4Co0.3Cu0.3O3, while Pr0.65Sr0.3MnO3, La0.78Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3, La0.7Sr0.25Mn0.5Cr0.5O3, La0.78Sr0.2FeO3, La0.58Sr0.4FeO3, and La0.65Sr0.3MnO3 showed negligible catalytic activity toward the OER.114 The results suggest that the OER performance is sensitive to cations and minor variations in stoichiometry. Sunarso et al.111 investigated the ORR activities of double perovskite LaNi0.5M0.5O3 (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) in alkaline solution. It was found that Mn-doping demonstrated the best performance based on ORR-limited current densities.111 Later, Yuasa et al.115 confirmed the observations by investigating the ORR activities of La0.4Ca0.6Mn1−yFeyO3 by tuning the Fe content. Their results indicated that a higher Mn content rather than a higher Fe content leads to higher activities on both ORR-limited current densities and onset potentials. Precious metals are also investigated as substitution cations (e.g., La0.6Ca0.4Co0.8Ru0.2O3) for improving the activities for an oxygen electrocatalyst.
Different from B-site cations, A-site cations usually do not contribute to the electronic structure near the Fermi level. However, they may affect the valence state of B-site ions, electronic conductivities, crystal structures, electrochemically active area, and oxygen vacancies. In the late 1970s, Obayashi et al.116 studied the LnMM′O3 (Ln: lanthanoid, M: alkaline earth, M’: transition metal) perovskite oxides as oxygen electrocatalysts, and they found that Sr substitution showed the best result and La1−xSrxCoO3 and La1−xSrxNiO3 showed the highest activities among all of the studied perovskites. The results were also confirmed by Tiwari et al.117 La1−xSrxCoO3 showed two Tafel slopes: 57 to 64 mV dec−1 at low and 100 to 130 mV mV dec−1 at high overpotentials. They also found that Sr substitution dramatically enhanced the electrochemically active area. Another study on the of A-site cations Ca by lanthanide (La, Nd, Sm, Gd, Y and Ho) in CaMnO3−δ showed that La3+ substitution resulted in enhancements in both electronic conductivity and porosity.118 The enhanced conductivity may be related to the absence of 4f electrons of La3+ and the oxygen vacancies.
Perovskites with both A- and B-site cations substitutions (A1−xA′xB1−yB′yO3−δ) were also intensively studied. For instance, Azizi et al.119 investigated Sr1.5La0.5FeMoO6 for bifunctional OER and ORR. The results showed superior activities resulting from enhanced electrical conductivity. Among all of these perovskites, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF) has received special attention.120 BSCF possessed high intrinsic OER activity (oxide surface area normalized current density), which was measured to be at least 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the state-of-the-art catalyst (IrO2 nanoparticles, ∼6 nm) in alkaline solution at the same potential.42 Early studies suggested that the high activities can be attributed to high electronic and ionic conductivity, high concentration of oxygen vacancies and high oxygen exchange kinetics.121–123 In 2011, Suntivich et al. demonstrated a volcano-like trend for OER activity versus eg orbital filling.42 This study systematically evaluated more than 10 perovskites, where double perovskites BSCF with an eg filling close to 1, occupied the peak (Fig. 5). As discussed above, the eg orbital at the perovskite surface will interact with the absorbates in the electrolytes through σ bonding.81 Thus, the eg occupancy will strongly affect the bonding length/energy and thus the OER performance. Since the eg orbital is antibonding, a high eg occupation corresponds to a weak bonding, and a low occupation corresponds to a strong bonding. Therefore, an eg occupancy of approximately 1 produces the highest activity according to the Sabtier principle, as observed in BSCF.

In 2013, Grimaud et al.49 synthesized a new group of double perovskites, Ln0.5Ba0.5CoO3−δ (Ln = Pr, Sm, Gd, Ho and Ln). Their intrinsic OER activities, normalized to surface area, are comparable to BSCF, which is 1 order of magnitude higher than that of LaCoO3. In comparison to BSCF, which readily amorphizes during the oxygen evolution reaction, Ln0.5Ba0.5CoO3−δ showed no significant changes during cycling, indicating the high stability. The high activity and stability of these double perovskites were explained by having the O p-band centre neither too close nor too far from the Fermi level, which was computed from ab initio studies.49 This mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 6. Similar observations have been found for the ORR. A stronger covalence of the B–O bond should increase the driving force and thereby facilitate the O2−/OH− exchange on the surface B ions, which can be considered as the rate-limiting step of the ORR.

In the 1980s, oxide perovskites were examined as catalysts for the synthesis of chemical fuels from CO.124 Broussard et al.125 found that LaMnO3 can catalyze the reduction of CO by hydrogen to hydrocarbons with 100% selectivity, and double perovskite LaMn0.5Cu0.5O3 leads to high selectivity to methanol. Cu0 and Cun+ are believed to be the key factor for production of alcohols, while pristine Cu0 only yields hydrocarbons. Similar findings were also obtained for LaRhO3, where methane was formed over Rh metal and oxygenates (up to 80% by weight) were produced over LaRhO3.126 Later, Schwartz et al. studied the electrochemical CO2 reduction to alcohols on La1.8Sr0.2CuO4, and found a Faradaic efficiency up to 40% at a current density of 180 mA cm−2.127


3.1.3 Non-stoichiometric perovskites and derivatives. 
It was proposed that the electronegativity, which tended to increase in late 3d elements with high oxidation states, was responsible for increasing the metal–oxygen covalency.72 In this regard, a perovskite containing high-spin Fe4+ ions, CaCu3Fe4O12 has been synthesized, which showed high activity, comparable to or exceeding those of the state-of-the-art catalysts such as BSCF and RuO2. In addition, the substitution of the “A” site with transition metals may form a covalent bonding network, which prevents the leaching of an alkaline earth metal. As a result, a higher stability was achieved associated with greatly reduced thickness of amorphous layers on the surface of catalysts.72
Kim et al. synthesized an oxygen-deficient perovskite electrocatalyst, Ca2Mn2O5, using a reductive annealing method for OER in alkaline media. The catalyst showed an onset potential of 1.50 VRHE, and reached an OER mass activity of 30.1 A g−1 at 1.70 VRHE. The results suggest that the oxygen vacancies and high spin electron configuration on Mn are likely contributing to the enhanced performance.58 Jung et al. reported Sr2+ or Ca2+ doped La2NiO4 as bifunctional catalysts for OER and ORR.128 Sr-Doping showed the highest OER and ORR activities. The increased Sr substitution likely drove the Ni oxidation state to be closer to 3+, corresponding to an eg-filling of approximately 1.
“A” site cation extraction or partial substitution is proven to be an effective method for enhancing the metal–oxygen covalence to achieve higher OER activities. This is because partial substitution on the A-site by low-valence metal ions generates additional oxygen vacancies and shifts a large proportion of the B-site transition-metal ions to unstable oxidation states (B3+/B4+ redox couple).129,130 This may result in enhanced oxygen mobility and kinetics, and thereby increased EC activities. For instance, our previous report on the O3-type metaloxides, NaNi0.9Fe0.1O2, demonstrated that the extraction of Na can lead to improvements in OER activity, which correlated with the enhancement of the valence states of Ni.17 Similarly, Seitz et al.131 reported that the Sr leaching from surface layers of thin films of perovskite SrIrO3 generated highly active surface layers with IrO3 or anatase IrO2 motifs. As a result, the IrOx/SrIrO3 catalyst outperformed IrOx and ruthenium oxide (RuOx) systems. It achieved 10 mA cm−2 at 270 mV overpotential for 30 h of continuous testing in an acidic electrolyte.
Recently, layered Ni0.9Fe0.1OOH was found to be an active catalyst in a study of the in situ structure transformation from Ni0.9Fe0.1Ox, which is directly parallel with the increasing catalytic activity.132 The layered structure allows the intercalation of water and anions, leading to high bulk redox activity.133 Studies on ZnCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) further confirmed that catalysts with such a layered structure had higher activities than Co-based catalysts with other structures.134 Gong et al.75 reported that incorporation of Fe into the nickel hydroxide induced the formation of NiFe-LDH. The crystalline NiFe-LDH phase in a nanoplate form is found to be highly active for OER in alkaline solutions. Driven by halide perovskite solar cells, the NiFe-LDH catalyst was able to reach a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 12.3% for splitting water,135 owing to its excellent OER and HER activities (as indicated in Fig. 7). Although a 2D structure provides a much higher active surface for a catalysis reaction, the weak interactions between layers hinder charge collection and transportation. Synthesizing ultrathin NiFe-LDH nanoplates on mildly oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been used to improve the charge transportations.75 A NiFe-LDH/CNT complex exhibited higher EC activity and stability for the OER than commercial precious metal Ir catalysts. Long et al.76 used graphene to further enhance the electron transport, resulting in superior electrocatalytic properties of the FeNi–GO hybrids for the OER with overpotentials as low as 0.21 V, which was further reduced to 0.195 V after the reduction treatment (FeNi–rGO).

Increasing the oxidation states of Ni is a viable approach to further improve the OER activity of FeNi-LDH. Unfortunately, increasing the oxidation states of layered FeNi-LDH is very hard due to the formation of metaphases.42,75,76 Weng et al.17 synthesized NaNiyFe1−yO2 with Na intercalated in layered NiyFe1−yO2 and then reduce the Na content by chemical extraction of Na, forming Na1−xNiyFe1−yO2, which is a layered double oxide consisting of [MO6] (M = Ni, Fe) octahedral layers with some residual Na atoms lying between the octahedral layers. Like NiFe-LDH, the layered Na1−xNiyFe1−yO2 double oxide structure provides more active sites than the O3 phase. The use and extraction of Na forces Ni and Fe to high chemical states. As a result, the new Na1−xNiyFe1−yO2 electrocatalysts exhibited remarkable OER activity and excellent stability. The same strategy can be applied to synthesize efficient Na1−xCo1−yFeyO2 OER catalysts. The superior catalytic properties can be ascribed to the layered structure as well as the enhanced covalence of Ni and Fe.

3.2 Photocatalysis
In PC devices, electrocatalysts are deposited onto solar absorber materials and the whole device is immersed into electrolyte. The electrodes usually play both roles of sunlight absorber and electrocatalyst. Therefore, the materials for photoelectrodes should satisfy stringent conditions in terms of stability under operating conditions, light absorption in the visible range, adequate alignment of band edges with the relevant redox potentials and overall efficiency.1,5,7,136–153 In a non-PEC PC device, both the oxidation and reduction reactions take place on the same photoelectrode. The reaction production rates are used to characterize the efficiency of the device. In a PEC PC device, an oxidation reaction occurs on the anode, whereas the reduction reaction occurs on the cathode. The photocurrent is more often used than production rates to characterize the device efficiency. Oxide perovskites have been intensively studied for photocatalytic water splitting (both non-PEC and PEC) for hydrogen production (partially listed in Table 7). Recently, oxide perovskite-based photocatalytic CO2 reduction has emerged as an important direction for solar-to-fuel conversions.

3.2.1 Single perovskites. 
As a typical perovskite, SrTiO3 (STO) has been studied for photocatalyzing overall water splitting and CO2 reduction. STO has a large band gap of 3.2 eV, and its bulk form can split water into stoichiometric mixtures of H2 and O2. A hydrogen production rate of 28 μmol H2 g−1 h−1 was reported when NiO was used as the cocatalyst.157 It was also found that decreasing the particle size reduced the hydrogen production rate. For instance, STO with a particle size of 30 ± 5 nm (6.5 ± 1 nm) delivered hydrogen with a rate of 19.4 μmol H2 g−1 h−1 (3.0 μmol H2 g−1 h−1). The reasons for this decrease were attributed to the increase of the water oxidation overpotential and reduced light absorption due to the quantum size effect for the smaller particles.153 Shoji et al.154 reported photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CO on the surface of STO with amorphous CuxO as the cocatalyst, under UV irradiation. The CO evolution rate was estimated to be 0.65 μmol h−1 cm−2, with a CO selectivity of ∼83%. The loading of CuxO was found to improve the CO selectivity by 20%. Bi et al.155 studied the photocatalytic CO2 reduction on a TiO2/STO heterojunction, and they found CH4 and CO as the gaseous products. Pt and Pd loading remarkably enhanced the photo-conversion efficiency of CO2 to CH4, achieving the highest production rate of 20.83 ppm h−1 cm−2 with Pd as the co-catalyst. Yoshida et al.156 reported Ag coated CaTiO3 for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, with a CO production rate up to 2.25 μmol h−1 g−1 (CO selectivity up to 44%).
Beside STO, many other single perovskites have been tested for PC applications. Bulk NaTaO3 with a bandgap of ∼4.0 eV showed the ability to deliver a H2 production rate up to 36750 μmol−1 g−1 h−1, in the presence of methanol in the electrolyte.146 Another study showed that it can produce 19800 μmol−1 g−1 h−1 of H2 with NiO (0.02 wt%) as the catalyst.147 Nakanishi et al.157 found that Sr doped NaTaO3 showed the highest CO production rate of 176 μmol h−1 (mass loading 0.25 to 0.5 g) with 2 wt% Ag as the cocatalyst (CO selectivity of 86%) under UV irradiation. Ca doping showed an inferior CO production rate of 148 μmol h−1, but with a higher CO selectivity up to 91%. Bulk LiTaO3, AgTaO3, and KTaO3 have bandgaps of 4.7, 3.4 and 3.6 eV, respectively. Kato et al. reported the corresponding H2 production rates under UV illuminations of 430, 138 (with 0.3 wt% NiO as a catalyst) and 29 μmol−1 g−1 h−1, for these perovskites respectively.148,149 The niobates have a smaller bandgap compared to their tantalate counterparts. For instance, KNbO3, NaNbO3, AgNbO3, and Sr1−xNbO3 have bandgaps of 3.12, 3.8, 2.9 and 1.9 eV, respectively.150–152 Hydrothermal synthesized KNbO3 nanowires produced 5170 μmol−1 g−1 h−1 of H2, under UV illumination with 25% methanol addition and 0.25 wt% Pt as a catalyst.157 AgNbO3 was able to produce 5.9 μmol−1 g−1 h−1 of H2 under visible light irradiation (>420 nm) under the same conditions for KNbO3.151 Sr1−xNbO3 delivered 44.8 μmol−1 g−1 h−1 of H2 in the presence of oxalic acid and 5 mM AgNO3 under visible light irradiation (>420 nm).150 Titanates, such as SrTiO3, CaTiO3, and PbTiO3, usually have bandgaps between 2.8 and 3.3 eV,153,158–164 while ferrites such as BiFeO3, LaFeO3, SrFeO3, and CaFeO3, usually have a bandgap between 1.8 and 2.7 eV.165,166 Hydrothermally synthesized BiFeO3 nanowires with a bandgap of 2.35 eV were reported to produce H2 at a rate of 400 μmol−1 g−1 h−1, in the presence of 4 mM FeCl3 and under visible light illumination (>380 nm).165 Sol–gel synthesized LaFeO3 showed a superior hydrogen production rate of 8600 μmol−1 g−1 h−1 in the presence of 10% methanol without catalyst loading under visible light illumination (>420 nm).166
However, a single oxide perovskite usually has bandgaps (>3.0 eV) too large for optimal photocatalytic applications. Elemental doping or alloying has been used to narrow their bandgaps. A number of dopants such as Cr, Mn, Ti, Ru, Rh, Ir, Er, and Zn have been used to reduce the bandgap of STO from 3.2 eV to as low as 1.9 eV (Ru-doping).158–162 However, no significant improvements in photocatalytic performance were found, in particular for Mn-, Cu-doping.159,162 Wang et al. and Li et al. showed that Ta and Bi doping can reduce the bandgap to 1.70 and 2.64 eV, respectively, but their observed catalytic activities are inferior to that of NaTaO3.172,173 Apart from cation doping, anion doping has also been used to reduce the band gap. N is the most common anion dopant for oxides. In some cases, the doping concentration can be high enough to form oxynitrides denoted as AB(O,N)3.174–185,189,190 Because the energy level of the N 2p orbital is higher than that of an O 2p orbital, the bandgap of oxides can be reduced with N doping. For instance, BaTaO2N and SrNbO2N can harvest a much wider range of visible light up to ca. 660 and 680 nm, respectively, which leads to theoretical solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiencies of over 15%.189 A particulate BaTaO2N photoanode prepared using a particle transfer method generated a photocurrent of 4.2 mA cm−2 at 1.2 VRHE.190 For N-doped titanates, LaTiO2N (LTON) is an n-type semiconductor with a bandgap of 2.1 eV (∼600 nm absorption edge). IrO2 loaded LTON was reported to achieve a quantum efficiency of ∼5%, while CoOx coated porous LTNO was able to reach a quantum efficiency of 27.1% at 440 nm, and it produced O2 at a rate of 3680 μmol−1 g−1 h−1 in the presence of 50 mM AgNO3.174 Further Ca doping of LTNO to form CaLaTiO2.25N0.75 reduced the bandgap to 2.0 eV, but decreased the O2 production rate to 500 μmol−1 g−1 h−1, loaded with 2.0 wt% IrO2 in the presence of 10 mM AgNO3.175 Perovskite LaMgxTa1−xO1+3xN2−3x (x > 1/3) was reported to directly split water with visible light absorption up to 600 nm. Its quantum efficiency of overall water splitting reached ca. 0.03% at 440 ± 30 nm.183 S-doping is also a widely used strategy for reducing the bandgap of oxides. For instance, perovskite oxysulfides, La2Ta2ZrS2O8, La2Ta2TiS2O8, and La2Nb2TiS2O8, are direct-bandgap semiconductors with absorption-edge wavelengths up to 540, 700 and 700 nm, respectively.188 The d orbitals of Zr, and Ti contribute to the CBM, while the S 3p orbitals contribute to the VBM. A La2Ta2ZrS2O8 photoanode coated with CoPi electrocatalysts reached a photocurrent density of 300 μA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE in a pH 13 electrolyte.188
Although the bandgap of single perovskite oxides can be reduced by oxynitrides and oxysulfides, the cation valence states can be difficult to maintain. For example, Nb/Ta cations in BaNbO2N/BaTaO2N tend to be reduced during nitridation of metal oxides, resulting in low photocurrent density. Therefore, some of the penta-valent Ta5+ in BaTaO2N was replaced by tetra or hexahydric-valent cations (Ti4+, Zr4+, Mo6+, and W6+) to control the donor density and the fabricated porous photoanodes achieved improved PEC performance under visible light.191


3.2.2 Double perovskites by chemical mutation. 
Though doping or alloying can effectively narrow the bandgap of semiconductors, the incorporation of extrinsic dopants may introduce a high density of defects that are harmful to device performance. In contrast, chemical mutation is known as one promising approach that can produce the derivatives with smaller bandgaps and without introducing detrimental defects.192,193 For example, the narrow bandgap (1.53 eV) semiconductor CuInS2 can be deduced from ZnS with a bandgap of 3.78 eV through chemical mutation of Zn2+ → Cu1+ + In3+. The strong coupling between Cu 3d10 and S 2p6 pushes up the VBM of CuInS2 in an energy position and therefore narrows its bandgap. This strong p–d coupling additionally endows CuInS2 with better defect tolerance. This method has been employed to design new oxide perovskites with narrow bandgaps and high defect tolerance desirable for PC applications.
With the mutation of Ti(IV) → M(III) + M(V), the prototype single perovskite CaTiO3 can evolve into 18 double perovskites, A2M(III)M(V)O6 (see Fig. 8), where M(III) = group VA elements (Sb3+, Bi3+) with lone-pair s orbitals (i.e. occupied s orbitals), M(V) = group VB elements (V5+, Nb5+, Ta5+), and A = group IIA elements (Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+).19 In these perovskites, the hybridization of the antibonding interaction between group VA elements (Sb3+, Bi3+) lone-pair s orbital and the O 2p orbital can push up the valence bands to high-energy positions, therefore facilitating the p-type doping with defect tolerance and improving the valence band mismatch for water splitting.21,23 However, all these stoichiometric double perovskites still exhibit very large bandgaps (∼3 eV or above).19,21 It was recently reported that the bandgap can be further reduced if the compositions of these double perovskite oxides are M(III)-rich. In this case, the additional M(III) atoms occupy the M(V) sites and become M5+, which introduces a new conduction band at a lower energy position, effectively reducing the bandgap. As an example, when additional Bi atoms are incorporated into Ba2BiNbO6 (BBNO), it leads to a general composition of Ba2Bi(Bix, Nb1−x)O6 (0 ≤ x < 1). The Bi atoms occupying Nb sites have Bi5+ oxidation states. The low energy-lying unoccupied Bi5+ 6s orbital introduces a new conduction band edge (indicated by the arrow on Fig. 9) below the conduction band edge of pure BBNO, resulting in a much reduced bandgap, varying from ∼1.4 eV at x = 1 to ∼1.9 eV at x = 0.07.21,23 Recently, Ge et al. showed that Bi-rich Ba2Bi(Bix, Nb1−x)O6 photoelectrodes with x = 0.4–0.07 can produce cathodic photocurrents up to 0.2 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE with positive onsets at ∼1.5 VRHE enabling unbiased water reduction.23 Additionally, hybrid PEC cells with three electrodes that are optically stacked but electrically parallel to each other delivered anodic photocurrent densities up to 6.02 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE.20

3.3 Photovoltaics
Oxide perovskites and related materials have also been used as absorbers for PV applications. Two types of solar cells have been explored. The first type uses the ferroelectric properties seen in ferroelectric oxide perovskites BaTiO3.197,198 In this type of solar cell, the photo-excited carriers are separated by the polarization-induced internal electric field,199 rather than the electric field developed at the p–n junctions in conventional solar cells. Such solar cells can generate open-circuit voltage (Voc) exceeding the bandgap of the absorber material.200–202 Dharmadhikari et al. reported the thin-film ferroelectric PV device based on BaTiO3 in 1982,203 followed by reports on LiNbO3-, (Pb,La)TiO3-, Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT)- and (Pb,La)(Zr,Ti)O3-based solar cells (Fig. 10). However, these PV devices showed low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), due to the very low short-circuit current density (Jsc) typically in the range of nA–μA cm−2.24 The low Jsc cannot be fully explained by the large bandgaps of the absorbers. For example, multiferroic BiFeO3 (BFO) has a relatively small bandgap of ∼2.7 eV that just straddles into the visible light region.204 BFO-based all-oxide PV devices can exhibit enhanced Jsc's within the range of 1–1.5 mA cm−2 when illuminated by a 150 W xenon lamp with a 2.85 sun light intensity.205 However, under standard AM 1.5 G illumination, the BFO PV devices only produced very small Jsc's roughly on the order of μA cm−2.24
 Fig. 10  A timeline plot for the reported PV device efficiencies of thin-film single layer ferroelectric oxides. BTO (BaTiO3), Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT), PLZT ((Pb,La)(Zr,Ti)O3), KNNO (KxNa1−xNbO3) and BiT (layered ferroelectrics Bi4Ti3O12, Bi5FeTi3O15, or Bix(Na,K)1−xTi3O15) are wide bandgap ferroelectric oxide semiconductors with an optical bandgap in the near ultraviolet range, i.e., 3–4 eV. BFCO (Bi2FeCrO6), BMO (BixMn1−xO3), and PZTNi (PZT + NiOx) are ferroelectric oxides with an optical bandgap in the range of 1–2 eV suitable for harvesting solar light with higher theoretical efficiencies. BFO (BiFeO3) (and doped BFO, BFO:D) has an optical bandgap somewhere in between ranging from 2.2–2.7 eV. Three materials with efficiencies above 1% are PZT (Pb(Zr,Ti)O3) thin-film (∼1.25%), Bi–Mn–O (mixed BiMnO3 and BiMn2O5) thin-film (∼4.20%) and BFCO (Bi2FeCrO6) based p-i-n heterojunction photovoltaic devices (∼2%). Reprinted with permission from ref. 24 with addition of Bi–Mn–O system,194 Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 system195 and a BFCO based p-i-n heterojunction PV device.196 Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 
Another type of solar cell using oxide perovskites and related materials as absorbers involves other effects in addition to ferroelectric properties. Recently, a ∼4.2% efficiency PV cell has been achieved under one sun illumination, using a mixed absorber consisting of a small bandgap ferroelectric BiMnO3 (1.2 eV) and non-ferroelectric BiMn2O5 semiconductor (1.23 eV).194 This oxide perovskite-based solar cell showed a much higher Jsc of ∼7.03 mA cm−2. Double perovskite Bi2FeCrO6 (BFCO), which can be considered as a solid solution of BiFeO3 and BiCrO3, demonstrated tunable bandgaps from 2.1 eV to 1.4 eV by varying the Fe/Cr cation ordering. The low-bandgap BFCO absorber led to greatly increased Jsc of 11.7 mA cm−2 in a single layer solar cell. The multilayer heterostructure-based solar cells exhibited even higher PCEs (up to 8.1%) under standard AM 1.5G illumination.70 Oxide perovskites containing 3d transition metals (TMs) typically have large carrier effective masses due to the nondispersive band edges derived from the localized 3d orbitals (Table 8), which lead to low carrier mobilities and high carrier recombination, limiting the PCEs. As shown above, the non-3d TM-containing oxide double perovskites, A2M(III)M(V)O6, can exhibit both lower bandgaps and smaller carrier effective masses, and can be attractive absorbers for PV applications.

4. Conclusions and perspectives
We have reviewed the structural and compositional flexibility, and chemical and thermal stabilities of oxide perovskites and their derivatives, and their versatile applications in EC, PC, and PV. Though significant progress has been made, more is anticipated since there are still a large number of oxide perovskites and derivatives that are theoretically predicted to exist, but have not been explored experimentally.
For EC applications, the current research is mainly driven by the activity descriptors. Identification of a more appropriate descriptor may facilitate new material design. Descriptors that establish reliable relationships between the constituent elements and the desired properties and also provide clear guidance for the experimental synthesis are highly desirable. Such descriptors will help screen the large number of oxide perovskites and derivatives with better properties for EC applications.
For PC and PV applications, the absorber materials require strong sunlight absorption, small carrier effective masses and high defect tolerance. The recently proposed non-3d TM-containing oxide double perovskites, A2M(III)M(V)O6, can potentially meet these requirements. As seen in Fig. 8, many of the predicted A2M(III)M(V)O6, have not been experimentally reported. These newly theoretically designed oxides may lead to PC and PV devices with much enhanced performance.
Because of the extreme structural and compositional flexibility, there are unlimited numbers of oxide perovskites and related materials that may exhibit versatile electrical and optoelectronic properties. Identify appropriate applications in EC, PC, and PV of all these oxides can be extremely challenging. High-throughput calculations and machine learning can unravel the hidden relationship between structure, composition, and physical properties of materials.207–211 We anticipate that machine learning may help expedite the discovery of promising candidates of oxide perovskites and related materials for efficient EC, PC, and PV devices.

Broader context
Clean energy conversion is crucial to sustain the rapid development of human society and mitigate the greenhouse effect and environmental pollution from fossil fuels. Practical utilization of clean energies requires energy conversions involving different processes such as photovoltaics (PV, from solar energy to electrical energy), electrocatalysis (EC, from electrical energy to chemical energy), and photocatalysis (PC, from solar energy to chemical energy). A key issue to realize a high-efficiency conversion process is to find stable, low-cost and environment-friendly functional materials. Due to their extreme structural and compositional flexibilities, oxide perovskites and their derivatives are attractive candidates for the diverse applications aforementioned. This paper reviews the structural and compositional flexibility of oxide perovskites and their derivatives and the progress of their applications in clean energy conversion. It attempts to describe how the properties of oxide perovskites and their derivatives are tuned for specific applications.


 	Fig. 1  The structural flexibility of oxide perovskites. From single cubic perovskite (center) to double cubic perovskite with the B-site ordering of rock-salt, random and layered structures (see Table 1 for detailed information). Through [BO6] octahedral tilt, cubic phases can transform to different tilted phases with three dominating ones shown on the bottom left. Under large distortion of [BO6] octahedra, the three-dimensional (3D) connection of octahedra can be broken, leading to 2D and 1D perovskite derivatives.

 	Fig. 10  A timeline plot for the reported PV device efficiencies of thin-film single layer ferroelectric oxides. BTO (BaTiO3), Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT), PLZT ((Pb,La)(Zr,Ti)O3), KNNO (KxNa1−xNbO3) and BiT (layered ferroelectrics Bi4Ti3O12, Bi5FeTi3O15, or Bix(Na,K)1−xTi3O15) are wide bandgap ferroelectric oxide semiconductors with an optical bandgap in the near ultraviolet range, i.e., 3–4 eV. BFCO (Bi2FeCrO6), BMO (BixMn1−xO3), and PZTNi (PZT + NiOx) are ferroelectric oxides with an optical bandgap in the range of 1–2 eV suitable for harvesting solar light with higher theoretical efficiencies. BFO (BiFeO3) (and doped BFO, BFO:D) has an optical bandgap somewhere in between ranging from 2.2–2.7 eV. Three materials with efficiencies above 1% are PZT (Pb(Zr,Ti)O3) thin-film (∼1.25%), Bi–Mn–O (mixed BiMnO3 and BiMn2O5) thin-film (∼4.20%) and BFCO (Bi2FeCrO6) based p-i-n heterojunction photovoltaic devices (∼2%).
