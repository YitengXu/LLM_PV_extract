    , Accepted 6th July 2013First published on 11th July 2013AbstractUsing density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT in different levels, we have systematically studied new porphyrin-based dyes with A–π–D structures focusing on optical absorption, light harvest efficiency, ground state oxidation potential, excited state oxidation potential, and natural transition orbitals. Compared with existing dyes, we find that these new dyes have wide absorption regions (400–1000 nm) with high molar extinction coefficients, and display good energy level alignment for efficient injection of electrons and fast regeneration of the oxidized dyes.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have received tremendous attention since the first demonstration by Grätzel in 1991.1 DSSCs have many advantages1–5 over silicon based photovoltaic devices, such as easy fabrication and low cost. To improve the performance, researchers have made great effort to explore various DSSCs. Among them, Ru-containing dye is such an example. Nazeeruddin and co-workers synthesized ruthenium(II) complex dye (N719) which shows an efficiency of more than 10% for the first time.6 Furthermore, Ru-containing dyes display broad absorption spectra, suitable alignments in energy levels, and good stability.4,7–10 However, Ru is not environmentally-friendly. Currently, more attention has been paid to organic dyes. The most well-known example is YD2 reported by Bessho et al., which is a porphyrin-based dye with a donor (D) and an acceptor (A) attached; the power conversion efficiency is about 11%.11 Moreover, porphyrin-based dyes exhibit other merits such as photochemical and electrochemical stabilities, strong absorbing ability in the visible region, and easy control.4,11–15 Based on YD2, Yella and co-workers synthesized a dye (YD-o-C8) with an efficiency of 12.3%.16 The underlying reasons for the high efficiency can be attributed to the following factors: (1) the A–π–D structure can enable easy transfer of excited electrons to the semiconductor (TiO2), can flexibly adjust the HOMO and LUMO levels, and can exhibit higher molar extinction coefficients.4,17,18 (2) Porphyrin is used as the π linker with outstanding photovoltaic properties.
However, both YD2 and YD-o-C8 suffer from a similar problem: the molar extinction coefficients are low in the region of 500 to 600 nm.16 Many groups have put effort into trying to overcome this weak point18–24 but have failed to do so completely. Here we study four new dyes by changing the donor and acceptor as shown in Fig. 1. We have found that they have high molar extinction coefficients in a broad absorption region of 400 to 1000 nm. Furthermore, for better understanding of these new dyes, we also study some other properties such as energy level alignment, electron localization, electron transition, light harvest efficiency, ground state oxidation potential, and excited state oxidation potential. We have found that the four new dyes studied have better performances compared with the existing YD2 and YD-o-C8 dyes.

Computational method and model
Calculations are carried out using Gaussian 09 (G09) with the basis set of 6-311G(d). The Becke's three-parameter and Lee–Yang–Parr's gradient-corrected correlation hybrid functional (B3LYP) is used due to the reasonable accuracy with affordable computational cost.25,26 It has been found that, for dyes, B3LYP can give acceptable results when compared with experimental values.27–34 Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange–correlation (PBE0),35 CAM-B3LYP36 and LC-ωPBE37 for long range exchange–correlation are also employed in our calculations for comparison.
Since dyes work in solvents, the solvent effect should be considered for accurate simulations. Here we performed calculations for dyes in tetrahydrofuran (THF) using the C-PCM model.38 And for optical absorption, time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) as implemented in Gaussian 09 is used in the calculations.
The differences between the studied new dyes and the existing YD2 and YD-o-C8 lie in the different acceptor chromophores (A) and the donor chromophores (D) as shown in Fig. 1. We chose benzothiadiazole (BTD) or a benzothiadiazole fragment as the A due to their strong electron-withdrawing abilities and the small energy gap favored for long wavelength absorption,40,41 and chose 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(4-dimethylamino-styryl)-4H-pyran (DCM) or triphenylamine (TPA) as the D because of their good electron-donation ability39 and the huge spatial hindrance to prevent aggregation.42,43 To further improve the electron-donation ability of D, we replaced the two alkyl groups connected to the N atom in DCM with benzene rings so that TPA and DCM can work together as the D. In this way, we get YD-D, YD-DB and YD-TDB dyes by changing D and A as shown in Fig. 1.
Results and discussions
1. Geometries of ground states
The first step in the calculations is to get the correct ground geometries of the dyes. By comparing the calculated HOMO and LUMO with experimental values, we can test the method. We start with YD2 and YD-o-C8. Table 1 shows the comparisons of the calculated HOMO and LUMO with experimental values. Generally for long molecules CAM-B3LYP and LC-ωPBE functionals are better than B3LYP and PBE0, however, this is not always the case, as we found here that the calculated HOMOs and LUMOs using B3LYP and PBE0 are closer to the experimental results than those of CAM-B3LYP and LC-ωPBE. This is because LC functionals suffer from a practical problem, namely the choice of the range-separation parameter (μ), which was found to be system and property dependent.44 So the ground geometries of the dyes are calculated using B3LYP and PBE0. We can see that, except for YD-D, the other three new dyes have higher HOMOs and lower LUMOs as compared with those of YD2 and YD-o-C8, because the D and A in the new dyes have better abilities for donating and withdrawing electrons respectively.

2. Molecular orbitals
Once the ground geometries are determined, we can further investigate the frontier molecular orbitals as shown in Fig. 2. We know that an A–π–D structure can induce a push–pull effect on electrons, which can help electrons transferring from the dye to the semiconductor. The molecular orbitals of the new YD dyes illustrate this effect very well. When the new dyes are in the ground states the electrons are mainly localized around the donor region, while in the excited states the electrons are mainly localized in the π linker and the acceptor region, which show that the ground electrons are pushed by the D and pulled by the A, thus the dyes are able to transfer electrons from the D to the A when excited by light. Since dyes are connected to the semiconductor via the A, so the excited electrons in the A would be effectively injected into the semiconductor. This process is favorable for improving the efficiency.
 Fig. 2  Molecular orbitals of the new YD dyes. 
From Fig. 2 we can see that the electrons are mainly localized around the D in the HOMO and HOMO − 1, while the electron density around the A is much less, showing a good electron-donating effect in DCM and TPA. Comparing LUMO and LUMO + 1 of YD-D with the other 3 dyes we find that more excited electrons are localized around A in YD-DB, YD-TDB and YD-o-TDB. In particular, there are many fewer electrons around the A in the LUMO + 1 for YD-D. This is because the BTD has a stronger electron-withdrawing ability than benzene. We can further compare the energy levels of the D and the A to better explain the difference in donating and withdrawing electrons. Since the HOMO energy provides an estimation of the ionization potential and the LUMO energy gives the approximated electron affinity,45 so a low LUMO energy level means a strong electron-withdrawing ability, and a high HOMO energy level implies a strong electron-donating tendency. Table 2 shows the HOMOs and LUMOs of the π-linker in YD2, and the donor and acceptor fragments in other dyes.

From Table 2 we see that the π-linker has a reasonable HOMO and LUMO as compared with those of D and A. The LUMO of the A in YD-DB is −3.17 eV which is lower than that of the A in YD2 (−2.10 eV). This explains why BTD is excellent for accepting electrons. Meanwhile, the D in YD-D or YD-TDB has a higher HOMO than that of D in YD2. According to Ajayaghosh's work17 the HOMO and LUMO of dyes with A–π–D structures are dominated by the HOMO of D and the LUMO of A, respectively. Thus our studied new YD dyes have a higher HOMO and lower LUMO.
Generally electron excitations are accompanied by electron recombinations, while the A–π–D structure provides a natural barrier to reduce the recombination. Taking YD2 as an example, the LUMO of the D and A is −0.37 eV and −2.10 eV, respectively. If the excited electrons go back to D from A, they need energy of at least 1.73 eV. Similarly the energy barrier for YD-D, YD-DB and YD-TD is 0.46 eV, 1.53 eV and 1.28 eV, respectively. Among them YD-D has the smallest energy barrier, because the A in YD-D is a benzene ring and the A in YD-DB or YD-TDB is a benzothiadiazole, which has a greater tendency to get electrons. From the above discussion we can conclude that the A with a strong electron-withdrawing ability enhances the injection of electrons and reduces electron recombination.
3. UV-Vis spectra
In applications, the ideal absorption spectra of dyes should cover the visible spectral region (400–800 nm) and even extend to the near-infrared (NIR) region (∼1000 nm). However, YD2 and YD-o-C8 don't have good absorption spectra in the region of 500–600 nm. Before calculating the absorption spectra of the 4 new dyes, we studied YD2 and YD-o-C8 first to make sure that the used exchange–correlation was good for the spectra calculations. Here we chose the ground structure calculated with B3LYP. Our results are listed in Table 3.

From Table 3 we can see that B3LYP and PBE0 give better results. There is only about 10 nm difference between the B3LYP results and the experimental values, and the results of PBE0 are also acceptable with a difference of about 20 nm. The CAM-B3LYP and LC-ωPBE calculations don't give accurate absorption data, so the spectra of the new YD dyes are calculated using B3LYP, as shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Absorption spectra of YD dyes. 
From Fig. 3 we can see that all of the studied new dyes have excellent absorption spectra, and they can absorb light from the visible region to the near infrared region with high molar extinction coefficients. For example, in the range of 400–1000 nm the molar extinction coefficients of YD-DB and YD-TDB are over 40000 M−1 cm−1. Compared with YD2 and YD-o-C8 we find that the new YD dyes have wider absorption regions and higher molar extinction coefficients. Using the Beer–Lambert law we can get the absorbance (A0) and the light harvesting efficiency (LHE):    where ε is the molar extinction coefficient, c is the molar concentration, l is the distance of light travelled, and I0 and It stand for the intensity of the incident light and the transmitted light, respectively. According to the work by Aswani et al.16 the LHE will be close to 100% when the molar extinction coefficient is over 30000 M−1 cm−1. Therefore, we can deduce the following conclusion: when the new YD dyes have the same molar concentration as YD2 and YD-o-C8, the LHE of the new dyes will be 100%.
From the spectra we find that each YD dye has two humps in the long and short wavelength regions respectively. To better understand the reason we calculated the oscillator strengths (f) as shown in Table 4. The extinction coefficients are obtained using the following expression based on the calculated excitation energies (ωI) and oscillator strengths (fI).26  where ε is the molar extinction coefficient in M−1 cm−1, the energies ω, ωI and the Gaussian full-bandwidth at half-height Δ are in cm−1, and fI is the corresponding oscillator strength. From this expression we can see that the relationship between ε and f is complicated. From Table 4 and Fig. 3 we find that YD2 and YD-o-C8 have high oscillator strengths in the short wavelength region and lower ones in the long wavelength region, which results in an obvious hump in the spectrum of YD2 or YD-o-C8. However, YD-D, YD-DB, YD-TDB and YD-o-TDB have high oscillator strengths in both the short and long wavelength regions, thus forming two humps in their absorption spectra. We can also see that YD2 has a smaller hump in the short wavelength region but with a higher molar extinction coefficient compared with YD-o-C8.

4. Energy level alignment
The energy level alignment plays a crucial role in effective charge transfer from a dye to a semiconductor, as well as in the reduction of the excited dye. Jiao and co-workers46 recently synthesized some new metal-free dyes with amazing wide absorption spectra and very high molar extinction coefficients. However, the LUMO energy levels are very close to the conduction band (CB) edge of TiO2, which leads to an insufficient driving force for electron injection.46 The highly efficient electron injection and fast regeneration of oxidized dyes need a good energy level alignment, which requires that the LUMOs of the dyes are higher than the CB of TiO2 while the HOMOs of the dyes are lower than the redox couple, both by at least 0.2 eV.47–49 From the optimized ground geometries, we can get the HOMOs and LUMOs of the dyes as listed in Table 1. The calculated HOMOs agree with the experimental values very well, but the LUMOs have about 0.4 eV difference from the experimental values. To get an accurate energy level of the new YD dyes, we calculated the ground state oxidation potential (GSOP) and the excited state oxidation potential (ESOP).49
GSOP can be obtained from the free energy difference between the neutral and the oxidized ground state species.50 For big molecules like YD dyes, such calculations are too costly. According to the Koopman's Theorem (KT), the GSOP can be approximated by the value of the HOMO energy of the neutral species.49–51 This approximation neglects the orbital and structural relaxation of the oxidized species. It has been found that50 the level alignment for the interacting nanoparticle–sensitizer system is very similar, within about 0.1 eV, to that for the separated TiO2 and dye. So we use the HOMOs' energies calculated with PBE0 as the GSOPs of the new YD dyes.
Similarly, the accurate ESOP of a dye is the free energy difference between the neutral and the oxidized states in the excited state of their respective equilibrium geometries.50 Such calculations are also quite expensive. Fortunately there is an approximate way to get the ESOP. Suppose that the dyes transfer electrons into the semiconductor immediately once excited by light, then the ESOP can be expressed as HOMO − Eλmax,52 where Eλmax is the energy of maximal absorption (λmax) for the longest wavelength, which can be found in the absorption spectrum. The calculated GSOPs and ESOPs are listed in Table 5.

We can see that for YD2 and YD-o-C8 the GSOPs and ESOPs agree with the experimental values very well with only about 0.1 eV difference for the PBE0 levels. Therefore the values calculated using PBE0 will be used for the discussions of energy level alignment. In applications TiO2 is used as a semiconductor with a CB of −4.0 eV26 while the I−/I3− redox couple is employed as an electrolyte with a redox potential of −4.8 eV,26 so YD-TDB and YD-o-TDB meet the requirement of the energy level alignment quite well for the effective charge transfer and fast excited dye reduction.
5. Natural transition orbitals
Molecular orbitals give us a picture of electron distribution, and show the potential for electron injection and the barrier for recombination, while natural transition orbitals (NTO)53 will give a more insightful picture of excited electron transitions in a dye molecule when excited by photons with different energies. As we know, an excited state is formed when electrons jump from occupied orbitals to unoccupied orbitals. It is difficult to do analyses when many ground and excited molecular orbitals are involved. However, the NTO method can help us solve this problem and can provide a qualitative description of an electronic excitation.52 We carried out NTO analysis for the new YD dyes to get the excited electron transitions, as shown in Fig. 4, where only excited states (ES) with an oscillation strength (f) larger than 0.1 are given. The blue (grey) area is for the ground electrons and the red (dark) area for the excited electrons. So from the ground state to the excited state, electrons move from the area in blue (grey) to the area in red (dark), showing the push–pull effect.
 Fig. 4  NTO analysis. Excited electrons transfer from the blue (grey) area to the red (dark) area. The three numbers in each group stand for the serial number of the ES, the oscillation strength, and excited wavelength, respectively. 
For the 8th and 9th excited states of YD-D, the NTOs show that the excited electrons transfer from the D to the entire molecule, which means that some excited electrons travel back to the D, so these two excited states would have a problem in effective charge transition, while YD-DB behaves better when only the 9th ES has the excited electrons localized in the D. We can see that the BTD with strong electron-withdrawing ability improves the situation. Compared with the 1st ES of YD-D and YD-DB, it is obvious that the π-linker of YD-D has more excited electrons, and in YD-DB the excited electrons are mainly localized around the A, which suggests clearly that BTD is more effective at accepting electrons than the benzene ring. The YD-TDB performs best in regards to electron transitions from the D to the A, since all of the ground electrons around the D are excited by light and then transfer to the A through the π-linker. Although both YD-TDB and YD-o-TDB have good electron transfer properties, the excited states with the oscillation strength larger than 0.1 are fewer in YD-o-TDB, which may affect the light absorption.
Conclusions
In summary, we have studied four new porphyrin-based dyes with A–π–D structures, and found that these new dyes can absorb light in the visible to the near-infrared (NIR) region (400–1000 nm) with high molar extinction coefficients. Moreover, the LHE of YD-TDB can reach up to 100% in the region of 400–1000 nm. Molecular orbital analysis suggests that the new YD dyes have good electron localization for fast electron injection and low electron recombination. Based on the calculated GSOPs and ESOPs, we find that YD-TDB and YD-o-TDB meet the required energy level alignment very well for highly efficient electron injection and fast regeneration of oxidized dyes. Furthermore, the NTO analysis depicts an insightful picture of the excited electron transition, and suggests that the electrons transfer from the D to the A when excited by light, demonstrating the push–pull effect for electrons in A–π–D structures. We hope that the present study will provide some new clues for the design and characterization of novel porphyrin dyes with improved performance for DSSCs technology.
