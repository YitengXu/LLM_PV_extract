    , Accepted 1st February 2019First published on 5th February 2019AbstractSand is one of the most abundant resources on the earth. Desert sand and the low-cost polymer polystyrene are used as raw materials to prepare sand/carbon composites for lithium storage using a low-cost and facile method. The electrochemical performance of sand is significantly improved by introducing PS-derived carbon frames. The sand/carbon composite shows a high reversible capacity of 555 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and superior cycling stability over 200 cycles. For the sand/carbon composites, the sand particles are linked with neighboring ones via carbon frames, increasing the electronic and ionic conductivity and alleviating the volume expansion/contraction during cycling. The unique microstructure is the main reason for the superior electrochemical performance of the sand/carbon composites. This work has developed a facile method to prepare anode materials for lithium ion batteries from natural sand and low-cost polymers.
1. Introduction
The shortage of fossil fuels and ever-increasing environmental pollution have highlighted the need for green and abundant energy resources, such as solar energy, tidal energy, biomass energy and so on.1 These energy resources have obvious regionality and/or intermittency, limiting their direct applications on a large scale. The key to resolving these problems lies in developing advanced energy storage technologies. The lithium ion battery (LIB), as an energy storage device widely applied in consumer electronics, is considered as one of the candidates with the most potential for advanced energy storage because of its relatively high energy density.2 LIBs have already been used to store energy for electric vehicles in our daily life. However, the electric vehicles powered by lithium ion batteries suffer from inadequate endurance mileage and too long charging times, arising from the inadequate specific capacity and poor rate capability of the electrode materials. Nowadays, the most commonly used anode material is commercial graphite, with a reversible capacity of less than 372 mA h g−1,3 and this cannot satisfy the ever-increasing requirement for LIBs with higher power density and energy density. In consequence, it is necessary to develop anode materials with higher specific capacity, better rate performance and low cost.
One potential direction for future research is to explore alternative anode materials to graphite. Besides carbonaceous materials, various anode materials, such as metal oxides,4 tin-based materials,5–7 Mo-based materials8 and silicon-based materials,9 have been investigated for electrochemical lithium storage. Among them, silicon is considered as a candidate for anode materials on account of its highest specific capacity (∼4200 mA h g−1).10 However, the drastic volume expansion during extraction and insertion of Li+ leads to the accompanying pulverization of anodes and rapid decline of capacity.11 Si mainly exists in the form of SiO2 on the earth. SiO2 had not been considered as an anode material on account of its low electrochemical activity towards lithium ions until Gao et al.12 reported that SiO2 nanoparticles could deliver a reversible capacity of 400 mA h g−1. According to Guo's research,13 the electrochemical reactions of SiO2 with lithium may be concluded as shown below: SiO2 + 4Li+ + 4e → 2Li2O + Si(1) 2SiO2 + 4Li+ + 4e → Li4SiO4 + Si(2)Guo et al. demonstrated that SiO2 was converted to Si and lithium oxide or/and lithium orthosilicate in the initial lithiation process. The newly produced lithium silicate and lithium oxide can alleviate the large volume expansion/contraction of silicon in the following lithiation and delithiation. As a result, SiO2 shows better cycling stability than silicon.14 However, the large volume change of SiO2 need to be further accommodated. Many novel structures such as nanonetworks,15,16 core–shell nanostructures17 and hollow spheres18 were designed and prepared to alleviate the volume expansion/contraction in the repeated lithiation/delithiation of SiO2. The fabrication process of nanostructured SiO2 is always complicated, high-cost and environmentally unfriendly.
SiO2 is the major constituent of sand, which is very cheap and naturally abundant on the earth. Sands are regarded as one of the most promising materials for lithium storage in terms of their low cost, good environmental compatibility, and high gravitational and volumetric capacity. In our previous work,19 the electrochemical lithium storage performance of sands from the Kubuji desert was reported for the first time. The sands milled for 72 h (∼1 micron) showed a stable reversible capacity of ∼400 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of 95% after 400 cycles due to the useful buffer of homogeneous impurities (metal silicates) and residue SiO2 in the sands. As the milling time increased to 108 h, the submicron sands delivered a highest capacity of 492 mA h g−1 because of the increased utilization of electrochemically active SiO2. However, the capacity retention was as low as 65% after 200 cycles. Moreover, the electronic contact between particles weakened with the decreasing particle sizes of the sands at the same time. In this work, a carbon frame is designed and introduced into the 108 h-milled sands to further accommodate the volume changes and improve the electronic and ionic contact between the sand particles. The sand/carbon composite, prepared using a facile and low-cost carbonization method, exhibits significantly improved cycling performance and rate capability. In addition, the facile and low-cost method may be easy to scale up for the industrial production of the sand/carbon composite.
2. Experimental and characterization
Synthesis of sand/carbon composites
Sand/carbon composites were synthesized by ball milling of sand combined with a straightforward pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS). The milling procedure can be found in our previous work.19 About 0.4 g of sand milled for 108 h was weighed and dispersed into 4 ml of a dimethylformamide (DMF) solution of hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) with a concentration of 0.25 wt%. PS was then dissolved into the above DMF solution by magnetic stirring. For the prepared sand/PS mixtures, the mass ratio of sand to PS was selected to be 1:1, 1:2 and 1:6, respectively. The uniform mixture was calcinated at 400 °C for 4 h under an Ar atmosphere because PS can be completely pyrolyzed at this temperature (Fig. S1, ESI†). After cooling down to ambient temperature, the as-prepared sand/carbon composites were washed with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried at 80 °C for 12 h.
Material characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on an X’Pert Pro diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). A Thermo Nicolet 6700 infrared spectrophotometer was used to measure Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. The morphology and microstructure of the composites were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4700) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F30).
Electrochemical measurements
CR 2032 coin-type cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box. For fabricating the working electrodes, 75 wt% sand/carbon composites and 15 wt% acetylene black were first mixed with 10 wt% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) in water at 80 °C. Magnetic stirring was applied in the mixing process to form a slurry. The slurry was then coated onto a copper foil followed by drying at 80 °C for 12 h under vacuum. Lithium foil and Celgard 2300 film were used as the counter/reference electrode and the separator, respectively. A 1 M LiPF6 solution of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1 by volume) was used as the electrolyte. The galvanostatic charge–discharge experiments were performed in a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V vs. Li/Li+ on a Neware battery test system (Shenzhen Neware Battery, China). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0.0–3.0 V vs. Li/Li+ on a CHI650B electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai, China).
3. Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of the sand/carbon composites and post-milled sand are shown in Fig. 1a. First of all, the characteristic XRD peaks of SiO2 at 20.7°, 26.4° and 50.1° can be observed for all the sand/carbon composites. The intensity of these XRD peaks is stronger than that of post-milled sand because the sand/carbon composites were synthesized at the temperature of 400 °C for 4 h. This result suggests that sand is still in the form of SiO2 after the calcination process. The broad and weak peak around 15–30° is related to the mixed peaks of low-crystalline SiO2 and carbon produced by the carbonization of PS.20 FTIR and Raman measurements (Fig. 1b and d–f) were carried out to further study the low-crystalline SiO2 and carbon. As shown in Fig. 1b, the broad FTIR absorption bands of the sand/carbon composites almost overlap those of the post-milled sand, suggesting that Si and O are still in the form of SiO2 after calcination at 400 °C for 4 h.21 Raman analysis was further carried out to examine the carbon produced during calcination. Two scattering peaks can be observed in the Raman spectra of the sand/carbon composites (Fig. 1d–f). One scattering peak centered at approximately 1350 cm−1 can be ascribed to the typical D peak of carbon, representing the degree of amorphization. The other scattering peak centered at approximately 1590 cm−1 is the G peak of carbon, representing the degree of graphitization.22 The Raman result demonstrates that PS was transformed into carbon in the calcination process. Moreover, the area ratio of the D peak to the G peak was calculated to be 1.003, 1.050 and 1.246 for the samples 2–4, respectively, indicating a low graphitization degree of carbon in the sand/carbon composites,23,24 in accordance with the XRD result.

For the sand/carbon composites, carbon can react with oxygen to produce gases but the sand including SiO2 and metal silicates is chemically inactive towards oxygen. Thus, the carbon content of each sand/carbon composite can be determined by calculating the mass loss of the sand/carbon composites heated under an oxygen atmosphere. Fig. 1c shows the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of the sand/carbon composites heated at a rate of 5 °C min−1 under an oxygen atmosphere. A remarkable weight loss is seen in the temperature range of 300–450 °C, corresponding to the oxidation reaction of carbon in the sand/carbon composites with oxygen.25 Based on the weight loss of carbon during heating, the carbon contents of the sand/carbon composites are 2 wt%, 5.5 wt% and 12 wt% for samples 2, 3 and 4, respectively.
The morphology of the post-milled sand and sand/carbon composites was first observed by using SEM. The irregular shape and uneven particle size distribution, resulting from the ball milling treatment in the synthesis process, can be seen in all the post-milled sand and sand/carbon composites. For the 108 h post-milled sand, as shown in Fig. 2a, the diameter of most of the sand particles lies in the submicron range of 100–400 nm, although the ball milling treatment results in a small amount of sand particles with a diameter larger than 1000 nm. Almost every particle is in loose contact with others. In contrast to the sand/carbon composites, the average particle sizes and the particle-to-particle contact are found to be associated with the carbon content in the sand/carbon composites. It is obvious that the particle size becomes larger and the particles link together after introducing carbon into the sand. As the carbon content is gradually increased to 12 wt%, all the sand particles link with each other (Fig. 2d), which may be attributed to the wrapping of carbon. TEM observation and elemental mapping of the sand/carbon composites were carried out to examine the wrapping of carbon on the sand particles. The sand/carbon composite with 5.5 wt% carbon was selected as the example for microstructural characterization of the sand/carbon composites. Fig. 3a presents the HRTEM image of the sand/carbon composite with 5.5 wt% carbon. No obvious lattice fringe can be seen in the HRTEM image (Fig. 3a), suggesting the low crystallinity of sand and carbon in the sand/carbon composite. This phenomenon is consistent with the result of XRD, as shown in Fig. 1a. As a result, it is difficult to distinguish the carbon and sand in the sand/carbon composite. The sand/carbon composite was further heated at 1100 °C for 4 h under an argon atmosphere because amorphous SiO2, the major constituent of sand, can be easily converted into the crystalline form at high temperatures. Fig. 3b shows the HRTEM image of the sand/carbon composite heated at 1100 °C for 4 h. The crystalline SiO2 can be distinguished from amorphous carbon as it is easy to find lattice fringes of SiO2 in the sand/carbon composite heated at 1100 °C. The XRD result of the composite, in the insert in Fig. 3b, indicates that sand is still in the form of SiO2 after being heated at 1100 °C for 4 h. The distribution of elements of the sand/carbon composite can be observed in the TEM elemental mapping images. As shown in Fig. 3c, Si and O show a uniform distribution in the sand/carbon composites but the distribution of carbon is not uniform. Based on the HRTEM observation and elemental mapping, it can be concluded that the sand particles are wrapped by carbon and the carbon frame acts as a bridge to connect neighboring sand particles. These results confirm that sand particles are embedded into the pyrolytic carbon frame rather than mechanically mixed with sand. Consequently, the average particle sizes of the sand/carbon composites are dependent on the carbon content in the sand/carbon composites (Fig. 2).

Fig. 4 exhibits the discharge and charge voltage profiles of post-milled sand and the sand/carbon composites at a current density of 100 mA h g−1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V. Both post-milled sand and the sand/carbon composites exhibit a voltage plateau at around 0.35 V during the initial discharge, corresponding to the irreversible electrochemical conversion from SiO2 to Li4SiO4, Li2O and Si in the initial lithiation process.26,27 Besides, there is an inconspicuous voltage plateau at 0.75–1.25 V, which can be ascribed to the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the electrodes. The initial discharge capacities are 885, 1035, 1075 and 975 mA h g−1, respectively, for the post-milled sand and sand/carbon composites with 2, 5.5, and 12 wt% carbon. The introduced carbon is considered as the active lithium storage material in the calculation of the lithium storage capacities of the sand/carbon composites. In other words, the capacities in this work are calculated based on the sand/carbon composites. As a result, the lithium storage capacities of the sand/carbon composites are found to increase first and then decrease with the increasing carbon content. The corresponding initial charge capacities are 422, 475, 583, and 488 mA h g−1, respectively. The irreversible lithium storage reaction of SiO2 and the formation of SEI layers during the initial discharge jointly lead to the low initial coulombic efficiency (less than 60%). Prelithiation is a good solution to the low initial coulombic efficiency of sand/carbon composites.28 Furthermore, the initial coulombic efficiency decreases with the increasing carbon content, which can be ascribed to more lithium consumption due to the formation of the SEI layers.29,30 These irreversible reactions can be deduced from the discharge–charge profiles shown in Fig. 4a and b. During the second discharge, a voltage plateau at about 0.5 V, different from that in the first cycle, can be observed in the post-milled sand and sand/carbon composites, which can be ascribed to the lithiation of Si. This result confirms the irreversible lithium storage reaction of SiO2 in the initial lithiation process for the post-milled sand and sand/carbon composites. These irreversible lithium storage reactions of SiO2 and the formation of SEI layers on the electrodes can be further confirmed by the CV tests. Fig. 5a–d show CV curves of post-milled sand and sand/carbon composites in the potential range of 0.01–3 V at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1. All the four samples display similar CV curves in the first three cycles. The first-cycle lithium storage behavior is different from that of the 2nd and 3rd cycles, implying the irreversible lithium storage reaction between SiO2 and Li. It is worth noting that a broad cathodic peak centered at ∼0.2 V appears for all samples in the 2nd and 3rd cycles. This cathodic peak can be indexed to the formation of amorphous phase LixSi.31 According to the above CV and discharge/charge behaviors of the post-milled sand and sand/carbon composites, it can be concluded that silicon or LixSi produced during the first cycle is in the electrochemically active phase but Li4SiO4 and Li2O developed in the initial lithiation represent electrochemically inactive phases in the following cycling.

The effect of calcination temperature on the cycling performance of the sand/carbon composites with 12 wt% carbon was investigated (Fig. S2, ESI†). It is obvious that the composite calcinated at 400 °C shows the highest reversible capacities. Thus, 400 °C was selected as the final calcination temperature to further study the electrochemical performance of the sand/carbon composites. As shown in Fig. 6, the prolonged cycling performance of post-milled sand and the sand/carbon composites was tested at a current density of 100 mA g−1. Compared with the post-milled sand, the sand/carbon composites show higher reversible lithium storage capacities and better cycling stability. The reversible capacities of all the samples increase with the cycling number at the first cycling stage because of their large particles. The particles cracked after the first few cycles, and more and more SiO2 was exposed, which can react with lithium during discharge. This activation in the first few cycles resulted due to the large particles of the sand/carbon composites. The maximum reversible capacities of samples 1–4 are 441 mA h g−1 at the 3rd cycle, 554 mA h g−1 at the 9th cycle, 591 mA h g−1 at the 2nd cycle, and 555 mA h g−1 at 10th cycle, respectively. Among them, the sand/carbon composite with 5.5 wt% carbon shows the highest reversible capacity of 591 mA h g−1. However, its cycling stability is not the best, in which the capacity retention is 79% relative to its maximum reversible capacity after 50 cycles. The cycling stability of sand increases with the carbon content in the sand/carbon composites (Fig. 6). The sand/carbon composite with 12 wt% carbon shows the best cycling stability. The capacity retention is as high as 91.5% after 50 cycles and 88% after 200 cycles.

Fig. 7 reveals the rate performance of sand and the sand/carbon composites at a current density from 100 to 2000 mA g−1. It can be obviously observed that the rate capability of sand is improved by introducing the carbon into post-milled sand. Moreover, the rate capability of the sand/carbon composites is found to be improved with increasing carbon content in the sand/carbon composites. During cycling at different current densities, the sand/carbon composite with 12 wt% carbon shows stable reversible capacities of 555, 458, 323, and 216 mA h g−1 at the current density of 100, 200, 500 and 1000 mA g−1, respectively. When the current density returns to 100 mA g−1, the reversible capacity of the sand/carbon composite with 12 wt% carbon recovers to 560 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. The capacity retention of the sand/carbon composites with 12 wt% carbon is 83% at 200 mA g−1, 58% at 500 mA g−1 and 39% at 1000 mA g−1 whereas those of the post-milled sand are only 77% at 200 mA g−1, 45% at 500 mA g−1 and 27% at 1000 mA g−1. This result suggests that the sand/carbon composites exhibit improved rate capability due to increased electronic and ionic conductivity.

The electrochemical performance of sand was demonstrated to be remarkably improved by introducing PS-derived carbon. The post-milled sand is wrapped by the PS-derived carbon frame (Fig. 3). For each sand particle, carbon is wrapped onto the surface of the sand particles, increasing the electronic conductivity of the sand particles and changing the SEI layers formed on the surface of the sand particles. These are the main reasons for the increased lithium storage capacities and initial coulombic efficiency of the sand/carbon composites, as shown in Fig. 6. Moreover, the sand/carbon particles are linked with neighboring ones via the carbon frames, improving both electronic and ionic conductivity between sand particles. Therefore, the sand/carbon composites exhibit better rate capability than the post-milled sand (Fig. 7). This wrapping structure of the sand/carbon composites is retained for up to 200 cycles (Fig. S3, ESI†), which can effectively buffer the volume expansion/contraction of SiO2 during lithiation/delithiation. Thus, this microstructure is beneficial for the stability of whole electrodes during repeated lithium insertion and extraction (Fig. 6). As the carbon content increases to 12 wt%, almost all the sand particles are linked with neighboring particles (Fig. 2d), resulting in the optimum rate capability and cycling stability for the sand/carbon composites.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed a simple method to synthesize sand/carbon composites derived from desert sand and PS. The microstructure, morphology and lithium storage performance of the sand/carbon composites were investigated by XRD, FTIR, Raman, TG, SEM, TEM and electrochemical lithium storage measurements. The post-milled sand particles were embedded into the PS-derived carbon frame. The electrochemical lithium storage performance was dependent on the carbon content in the sand/carbon composites. As the carbon content increased to 12 wt%, the sand particles were almost fully embedded into the carbon frame, exhibiting high reversible capacities of 555 mA h g−1 and stable cycling performance over 200 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance of the sand/carbon composites can be attributed to the alleviated volume expansion/contraction of the carbon frames and enhanced electronic and ionic conductivity between sand particles.
