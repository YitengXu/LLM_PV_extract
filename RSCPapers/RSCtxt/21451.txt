    , Accepted 7th August 2018First published on 7th August 2018AbstractBiopolymers are particularly suitable for drug applications due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low immunogenicity. There has been growing interest in using biopolymers to achieve the controlled release of therapeutics. However, the solubility and processability of biopolymers remain challenging due to their structural heterogeneity and dense networks of inter- and intramolecular interactions. Fortunately, ionic liquids (ILs), regarded as green solvents, have been increasingly appreciated for their unparalleled power for biopolymer processing. By the dissolution of biopolymers in ILs, various materials including sponges, films, microparticles (MPs), nanoparticles (NPs), and aerogels can be generated as potential drug delivery carriers. Besides, ILs can be used as reaction media and/or catalysts for biopolymer chemical reactions, which show enhanced reaction efficiencies. In addition, because of their unique physicochemical (e.g., polarity, hydrophobicity, amphipathicity and miscibility) and biological properties (e.g., antibacterial activity), ILs can assist or participate in the formation of drug delivery carriers. To cover all these aspects of the research, this review provides an overview of the recent progress in using ILs for the engineering of next-generation drug/gene delivery carrier materials. The tunable properties of ILs as affected by their structures are highlighted. Also, the key principles, challenges and prospects of this area are presented.Jin ChenJin Chen is now pursuing a PhD degree at the School of Food Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology.

1 Introduction
During the past few decades, considerable progress has been made in therapeutics and pharmaceutics for treating various diseases. Stimulus-responsive and target-specific delivery systems are the two most outstanding examples, which take advantage of the physiological and pathological bases of humans for delivering bioactive compounds to the site of interest with maximized therapeutic potential and minimized toxicity.1 However, it is worth noting that the toxicity of drug delivery systems (DDSs) could not only be attributed to the unwanted drug release, but also the low biocompatibility and degradability of the drug carrier materials. Materials for drug applications need to minimize the possibilities of hypersensitivity reactions and afford excellent tissue compatibility.2 Thus, owing to the unique properties of biopolymers such as versatility, biocompatibility, and bioabsorbability, numerous efforts have been undertaken to prepare drug/gene delivery systems from biopolymers. Moreover, biopolymers, either intrinsically or via modification, can exhibit antibacterial activity and suitable mechanical and adhesive properties,3,4 making them ideal for biomedical applications.
Although biopolymers serve as abundant, diverse, and renewable sources, their low solubility in conventional solvents makes it rather challenging to prepare materials from biopolymers or undertake chemical derivatization of biopolymers. This is especially the case for polysaccharides, which have a sophisticated native structure combining amorphous and crystalline regions with strong hydrogen bonds between the molecular chains. Only certain polysaccharides can be dissolved and/or modified in selected polar solvents (e.g., water, pyridine, formamide, dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)).5–8 For example, due to the supramolecular structure,9 starch exhibits low solubility in almost any solvent except DMSO.10 However, these polar solvents except water are either flammable, toxic or corrosive, or have difficulty in solvent recovery,11 which may cause safety issues to humans and the environment. Furthermore, to fully dissolve biopolymers, multi-step pretreatment is often needed, followed by prolonged mechanical stirring, which will cause intensive energy consumption. With consideration of these limitations, it is highly desirable to find potential green solvents for biopolymers. Recently, ILs have shown great potential to address the issues mentioned above. ILs are a group of salts formed from bulky, unsymmetrical ions with a delocalized charge, which makes them liquids at relatively low temperatures (<100 °C). In particular, those ILs that have a melting point below room temperature are called room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs).12 Since most ILs are nonvolatile, recyclable, nonexplosive, and thermally robust, they can be used as more environmentally friendly solvents compared to conventional organic liquids.13 The most common examples of ILs include salts of organic cations, such as imidazolium, pyridinium, ammonium, or phosphonium,13 and the derivatives of these salts with different lengths of side alkyl chains and structural functionalities. On the other hand, examples of anions vary from organic ions such as lactate (Lac)14 and formate15 to inorganic ions such as hexafluorophosphate (PF6), tetrafluoroborate (BF4), and then to chloride (Cl) and bromide (Br) in several low-melting salts.13
Interestingly, the variety of possible combinations of anions and cations can, in principle, generate a wide range of excellent and recyclable media with extensive tuneable properties.16 These solvents present unusual solubility and miscibility properties, attractive electric conductivity with a wide electrochemical stability window, interesting polarity nucleophilicity for catalysis, and remarkable tribological properties.17 These features endow them with a diversified range of applications including the processing of biopolymers. The application of ILs allows the comprehensive utilization of biopolymers by combining two major green chemistry principles: using environmentally preferable solvents (ILs) and biorenewable feedstock (biopolymers). Motivated by the excellent solubility of biopolymers in ILs, the application of ILs offers opportunities for not only the in situ functionalization of biopolymer materials,18–21 but also the creation of novel hybrid materials, such as ionogels.22–24 For instance, guar gum has been exploited as a biosource to generate highly conductive and elastic ionogels with ILs.25,26 The combined presence of guar gum and poly(ionic liquid) (P(IL)) conferred excellent dimensional stability on the ionogels with no IL exudation combined with high thermal properties (up to 310 °C).25 Confinement of ILs in gel matrices makes them suitable for a large range of applications. These could include soft matter electronic devices such as quasi-solid dye-sensitized solar cells,27 actuators,28 sensors29 or electrochromic displays,30 as well as biomedical applications such as electrical-sensitive matrices31 and DNA ionogels.32 Nonetheless, the green aspect of ILs was often over-exaggerated and its effects on exposure to the environment and in the human body have not been well understood.33–35 Despite their extremely low vapour pressure that prevents the evaporation of ILs to the atmosphere, ILs will inevitably end up in aqueous and soil environments. Thus, it is vital to consider the impact of ILs with regard to their ecotoxicity and biodegradability, since it may damage the greenness of biopolymers, especially considering safe drug/gene delivery applications.
ILs have been increasingly demonstrated to be able to dissolve various biopolymers,36–40 and to serve as green reaction media for catalysis processes41 and the derivatization of biopolymers42–46 for the promotion of 2D- and 3D-based biopolymer matrices in pharmaceutical applications (Fig. 1). Moreover, some new applications such as pharmaceutical ILs are emerging.47 Being very effective at dissolving many types of biologically active compounds (e.g., proteins, nucleosides, and amino acids)32,48 and at working as drug/gene delivery carriers,49 ILs are considered highly useful for the pharmaceutical industry. In recent years, there have been several reviews documenting the advances in using ILs for pharmaceuticals,47 and the application of ILs for biodegradable composite materials,50 or chitin and chitosan materials for biomedical applications.51 To the best of our knowledge, the application of ILs in the development of biopolymer-based DDSs has not been systematically reviewed. Trends are continuing through the rapid development of new technologies involving the use of ILs for the processing of biopolymers and for the fabrication of IL-based drug formulations and biopolymer-based DDSs. In this review, the role of ILs in the fabrication of carrier materials is particularly focused. The cations and anions constituting the ILs considered in this review are listed in Tables 1 and 2. We will discuss the strategies and principles to create carrier materials that are effective at drug delivery and drug formulations, and illustrate how these principles are underpinning the development of biopolymer-based DDSs.

2 ILs and their significance in biopolymer materials
Studies of biopolymer materials with the use of ILs have demonstrated huge opportunities for clean processes for biopolymers and for the creation of new functional IL-biopolymer complexes thanks to the favourably tailor-made chemical, physical and biological properties of ILs (Fig. 2). Thus, in this section, considering the core solvent properties of ILs, we will discuss the structural factors of biopolymers and ILs, the physicochemical properties of ILs, and the dissolution process of biopolymers in ILs that could be applicable to biomedical applications especially drug/gene delivery.
 Fig. 2  Physicochemical and biological considerations of ionic liquids (ILs) for the processing of biopolymers in drug application. 
2.1 Biopolymers
Nowadays, a variety of naturally occurring polymers derived from renewable resources are available for material applications to decrease our dependence on fossil fuels and increase the biodegradability and biocompatibility of materials.52 These biopolymers are produced from living organisms and can be classified into three main groups, namely polysaccharides, proteins, and nucleic acids. Biopolymers can perform a diverse set of functions in their native settings. For example, proteins can function as structural materials as the quintessential part of motility, stabilization, elasticity, scaffolding, and the protection of cells, tissues, and organisms.53 Thus, increased understanding of biopolymer structures and how they function in biology is the key step for the success of biopolymer materials.53,54
When applied in materials science, structural proteins are mostly studied for use in biomedical applications due to their easy processing and impressive mechanical strength,55,56 for example silk.57 The interest in silk as a biomedical material is due to its enhanced environmental stability, significant crystallinity, impressive combination of strength and toughness, high elasticity, and resistance to failure in compression.57 More typical examples of these proteins include collagen and gelatin. Collagen is a long and fibrous structural protein and multiple collagen fibrils can form into collagen fibres, which are the major component of the extracellular matrix and support most tissue and cell structures because of their great tensile strength.58 Being partially hydrolyzed under mild conditions, the three collagen strands separate into globular, random coils and produce gelatin. In contrast with collagen, gelatin has relatively lower antigenicity and may promote cell adhesion, differentiation, and proliferation, which is particularly attractive in the application of multifunctional vehicles for cell and growth factor delivery in regeneration research.59
Polysaccharides are long carbohydrate molecules composed of repeated monosaccharide units joined together by glycosidic bonds. Cellulose, chitin, starch, and chitosan are the most common examples of polysaccharides. They are naturally derived from various sources and have complex crystalline and amorphous structures caused by strong intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds within the polysaccharides. For example, starch can be extracted from plant roots, stalks, and crop seeds (e.g., rice, corn, wheat, tapioca, and potato).60 Starch is made up of two polymers of anhydrous glucose units, namely the unbranched amylose (with α-(1–4) linkage), and the highly branched amylopectin (with α-(1–4)- and α-(1–6)-linkages). The ratio between these two starch macromolecules and the way they are organized within the granule give rise to several ordered size scales: intact granules (1–100 μm), growth rings of alternating crystalline and amorphous regions (100–500 nm), and alternating crystalline and amorphous lamellae (9–11 nm).61 When linked by β-(1–4)-D-glucose units, cellulose consists of linear chains and is the most abundant polysaccharide on Earth.62 These chains are hydrogen-bonded in both parallel and antiparallel manners, which impart more rigidity to the structure and the subsequent packaging of bound-chains into microfibrils (highly structured crystalline regions). Thus, cellulose has high chemical and mechanical stability. The molecular structural difference usually affects the kind of arrangement of molecular chains and contributes to the supramolecular structures of different biopolymers. As the second most abundant polysaccharide, chitin shares structural similarity to cellulose (both having β-(1–4)-glycosidic linkages). Nevertheless, because of an additional acetamide group in its structural unit,63,64 chitin forms more complex inter- and intramolecular hydrogen-bond networks. After partial or complete deacetylation of chitin,65,66 chitosan is produced, which has –NH2 functionality on the C-2 of the D-glucosamine repeat unit.67 As a result, chitosan possesses many important properties including low toxicity, high adsorption capacity, film-forming ability, and bacteriostatic action.65,66,68 Still, chitosan presents a highly ordered structure (the presence of amorphous and crystalline regions because of strong hydrogen bonding). This highly ordered structure of biopolymers makes it challenging to find suitable solvents for its dissolution and derivatization.69 As an attempt, the research into the use of ILs for biopolymer dissolution is thriving quickly.
2.2 ILs and their related properties for biopolymer materials
ILs are ionic compounds with immeasurable combinations of anions and cations and the resulting far-ranging properties (Fig. 2). More importantly, influences such as the strength of charges between the cation and the anion, and the polarity and the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the molecules, all contribute to the manifestation of the structure and the nature of substituent groups. To optimize the application of ILs in carrier materials, it is essential to understand the physicochemical properties of ILs. Here, the key parameters of ILs that affect the formation of carrier materials are described, especially those related to the solvation capabilities of ILs for biopolymers, which is a prerequisite for the fabrication of carrier materials.
The polarity and viscosity of ILs are the prime parameters for the solvation capability. Generally, ILs are classified as highly polar solvents on account of their ionic nature.16,70 It was observed that ILs have polarity close to those of short- to medium-chain alcohols or formamide.71 The polarity of ILs depends mainly on the anion. The nature of the anion determines the polarity and thus the resulting hydrogen-bond basicity of ILs,72,73 which favours the dissolution of biopolymers. While a high viscosity exerts an opposite effect, ILs with a low viscosity are more efficient at dissolving biopolymers.74,75 The viscosity of ILs is higher than that of water and is similar to that of oils, and decreases with increasing temperature.76,77 Moreover, like polarity, the viscosity depends primarily on the anion type. Moreover, the viscosity of ILs is highly sensitive to cosolvents. For example, the presence of water in ILs can decrease viscosity sharply.78 The presence of cosolvents seems to decrease the aggregation of ions in the liquid, resulting in a reduced viscosity.
Due to their high polarity, ILs are usually miscible with polar solvents such as ketones, lower alcohols and dichloromethane, but are immiscible with nonpolar organic solvents including ethers and alkanes.79 Based on their water miscibility, ILs can be classified into hydrophilic (water miscible) and hydrophobic (forming a biphasic system with water) ones. Considering the hydrophilic nature and the hydrogen bonding ability of biopolymers, the hydrophilicity of ILs promotes the dissolution process. The hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of ILs can be adjusted by the introduction of structural functionality on the cationic or anionic part. For example, armed with long chain alkyl chains in their cation, ILs show amphipathicity and behave like surfactants in aqueous solutions.80 Moreover, owing to their strong and directional polarizability and excellent water solubility, surfactant ILs were observed to self-assemble into highly structured forms, which could be useful for the preparation of a variety of nanomaterials.81 Particularly, this self-assembly behaviour can be adjusted just by changing the ion type and the alkyl chain length of ILs.82
2.3 Dissolution of biopolymers in ILs
Owing to the capability of forming a broad range of intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonds, dipolar, dispersive and ionic interactions,83,84 ILs have been shown to be excellent solvents for a vast range of biopolymer compounds, such as proteins (e.g., silks,85 collagen,86 and gelatin,87 and zein88), DNA,32,89 and polysaccharides (e.g., cellulose,62 chitosan,90 chitin,91 heparin,38 starch,92 and guar gum93). To date, most of the earlier studies have focused on the dissolution of polysaccharides in ILs (Table 3). Remarkably, it has also been reported that ILs can be employed for the selective dissolution and extraction of desired components from raw biomass without the need for purification,94 for example, wood,95 cellulose-rich pulp,21 and crab and shrimp shells.95–100 Take chitin as an example, most of the current industrial extraction of chitin involves multiple processes with the use of harsh acids and caustic soda at elevated temperatures,66 which are waste- and energy-intensive. Besides, degradation of the chitin structure often occurs during the process, leading to a reduced molecular mass (M) and degree of acetylation (DA), thus changing the properties of the biopolymer.101 When 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][Ac]) was used, 94% of the available chitin in shrimp shells can be extracted in a single step and recovered with high weight-average molecular mass (Mw) and purity.96 Moreover, this less chemical- and energy-intensive process can retain the acetylation of chitin, indicating that chitin is not deacetylated into chitosan during the dissolution process.98 During the dissolution, ILs can hold higher concentrations of biopolymers compared to other solvents, which enhances the process efficiency.102,103 For example, chitosan with a high M can be dissolved by 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([BMIM][Ac]) to achieve up to 50 wt% concentration by completely disrupting the hydrogen bonds in the structure of chitosan, suggesting excellent dissolution.104 Nonetheless, since excessively high concentrations of biopolymers are not suitable for the handleability and processability,105 in this part, only the dissolution of biopolymers used for the process of potential biomedical application (including the drug/gene delivery system) is discussed.

All ILs reported in the literature for the dissolution of biopolymers are hydrophilic and polar ILs, especially those with 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium cations (mostly used) (Table 3). Only a few other ILs such as choline hexanoate ([Ch][Hex]) and choline citrate ([Ch][Cit])123 have been explored to promote the development of ILs with the outstanding ability to dissolve biopolymers and raw biomass. For instance, inexpensive ILs such as 2-hydroxyethylammonium acetate ([NH3(CH2)2OH][Ac]) and hydroxylammonium acetate ([NH3OH][Ac]) can be used to pulp shrimp shells with high chitin yields and purity at up to ten times the biomass loading, although these ILs could potentially result in lower Mw chitin.97 In addition to the green aspects, ILs can dissolve these biopolymers under relatively mild operating conditions and at normal atmospheric pressure.36–38 Yet, to completely dissolve a biopolymer, an IL must diffuse into the molecular structure to disentangle molecular chains and to disrupt the amorphous and the ordered regions.3 Thus, the dissolution of biopolymers usually occurs at moderately higher temperatures (80 °C–130 °C) (Table 3). Besides, for imidazolium ILs, which are solid or a sticky paste at room temperature,17 high temperatures are often needed to make them become liquid. Nevertheless, the total energy required for the processing of biopolymers should be low according to green chemistry principles. Thus, for more efficient energy production from biomass, heating should be avoided as much as possible to reduce the energy costs. To overcome this drawback, microwave irradiation39 or sonication40 has been applied to assist the dissolution process, which can reduce the dissolution time and energy consumption compared with those required when only thermal heating is used. However, these techniques may cause polymer decomposition or incomplete dissolution due to the excessive, localized overheating.124 These drawbacks should be taken into consideration for practical applications.
Compared with the cation, the disruption of hydrogen bonding is believed to be highly dependent on the interactions between the anion and the functional groups (e.g., –NH2 and –OH) of biopolymers.125 Thus, ILs with coordinating anions72,73 can effectively dissolve biopolymers (Table 3). Among halide ions, the chloride ion has been demonstrated to be a strong hydrogen bond acceptor and one of the most effective anions in dissolving biopolymers.126 For example, cellulose was soluble in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([BMIM][Br]) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate ([BMIM][SCN]) but presented less than half a degree of solubility in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM][Cl]).102 However, the M of biopolymers was often significantly reduced during such processing, which is related to the acidic hydrolysis of, for example, the glycosidic bonds of polysaccharide.127–129 Instead, ILs with acetate anion were found to be much less aggressive for degrading biopolymers.130 Owing to its lower viscosity, higher polarity, and stronger basicity for hydrogen bonds than chloride anion,131 acetate ILs can surpass chloride-based ILs with a higher dissolved biopolymer concentration91 or a lower dissolving temperature for the same amount of polysaccharides.131 For example, high M chitosan with a Brookfield viscosity of 200000 cps only swelled in [BMIM][Cl], and no complete dissolution was observed at 100 °C even after 4 days.104 In contrast, [BMIM][Ac] was capable of completely dissolving chitosan. Moreover, acetate ILs are distinctly better than the chlorinated ILs in dissolving various chitin materials with different origins.91,132 Results showed that [EMIM][Ac] can dissolve significantly larger amounts of the shrimp shell samples (46.0 wt%) than 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([EMIM][Cl]) (9.7 wt%) or [BMIM][Cl] (10.0 wt%).96 Furthermore, with the assistance of microwave treatment, a 73.5 wt% shrimp shell sample (at least 94 wt% of the available chitin) can be dissolved in [EMIM][Ac] with a total irradiation time of 2 min.96 Despite the predominant role of the anion, the chemical structure of cations does affect the biopolymer dissolution. Compared to [EMIM][Cl], [BMIM][Cl] gives better dissolution for all the chitinous samples96 and cellulose materials.133 Although the effect of cation ions is not yet entirely understood, the alkyl chain length75,102 or the functional groups of side chain134,135 in the cation may exert their influence on the solubility of biopolymers. Still, additional experimental and theoretical studies are needed to fully elucidate the effect of the nature of specific anions and cations on the solvation ability.
Various biopolymers present different dissolution behaviours in the same IL. For example, cellulose was readily soluble in [EMIM][Ac] (with a polymer content up to 12 wt%) whilst chitin can only be dissolved up to 4 wt% under the same process conditions.136 Besides, the difference in dissolution can also be reflected by the dissolution time. When adding cellulose or chitosan to [BMIM][Ac], the dissolution time to achieve a 6 wt% concentration of chitosan was 3–4 days at 85–95 °C while the time for the same weight percentage for cellulose was 12 h.104 All these differences in dissolution arise from the different biopolymer structures, for example, the crystallinity and polymorphic form. Compared with the amorphous regions, the dissolution of the ordered structure is much more difficult in ILs. [BMIM][Cl] was found to only dissolve the noncrystal domains of a native chitin, leaving compact crystal domains unaltered.91 Moreover, the solubility of chitin shows less difference between the crystal forms (i.e., α- or β-crystal), but strongly depends on its M.91 Chitin with lower M can be readily dissolved in 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([AMIM][Cl]) with increased solubility, whereas those with higher M cannot be dissolved at 110 °C and form liquid crystals at room temperature.137 This indicates the importance of molecular features, especially M, for the dissolution of biopolymers. Another example lies in the dissolution of wood pulping. Low M of biopolymers leads to high solubility. Different dissolved concentrations were found in [EMIM][Cl] linked to the various degrees of polymerization (DP) of lignocellulosic polymers, that is, 11.5 wt% for microcrystalline cellulose (DP = 270), 8.7 wt% for pulp sheet 1 (DP = 487), 4.3 wt% for pulp sheet 2 (DP = 1056) and 3.8 wt% for peach pulp (DP = 687).21 Moreover, the functional groups of biopolymer molecules also affect the dissolution behaviour. Results showed that chitins with DAs of 38.1%, 23.8% and 18.1% were soluble in [AMIM][Cl] at maxima of 3, 5, and 8 wt% concentrations, respectively. However, chitins with DAs of >50% could only be dissolved in [AMIM][Cl] below 1 wt%, suggesting that the existence of acetamide groups could hinder the dissolution of chitin.138
Because of the high tendency for water absorption of ILs, water is often found in ILs as the impurity or the cosolvent. Yet, water is found to strongly influence the solubility of biopolymers, especially for carbohydrates. Results have shown that water can significantly modify the solvation ability of ILs by linking the glycosidic units causing aggregation and decreasing the accessibility of ILs to carbohydrates.139 This effect may vary for different polysaccharides. For example, water was capable of acting as a good cosolvent, alongside [EMIM][Ac], to further improve the dissolution of starch, whereas the opposite was observed for cellulose.127,140 Thus, it could be difficult to predict the behavior of a biopolymer in a given IL due to the significant structural variations of ILs and biopolymers.141
3 Application of ionic liquids for the preparation of biopolymer materials for drug/gene delivery
Motivated by the remarkable benefits of using ILs in the dissolution of biopolymers, ILs have been exploited to prepare matrices, scaffolds, and composite materials (Table 3), or to functionalize biopolymers for desirable attractive physicochemical, mechanical and biological properties useful for drug/gene delivery (Fig. 3). Besides, ILs can be used as a component polymer interacting with biopolymers to form nanocomposites for drug/gene delivery systems or directly involved in the biopharmaceutical formulations. In this section, the role and application of ILs in carrier materials for potential drug/gene delivery systems and active pharmaceutical formulations will be discussed.

3.1 Regeneration and processability of biopolymers in ILs
The biopolymer dissolution in ILs offers huge potential for the formation of biopolymer-based materials. Allegedly, those dissolved materials can be easily regenerated without derivatization, thus producing sustainable materials that can overcome the complexities pertaining to the processing techniques encountered in the case of organic polymer gels.30 For instance, based on the excellent miscibility of ILs in organic solvents, the addition of various antisolvents, such as water,115,142 acetone,45 methanol,143 and ethanol,144 allows the regeneration of biomatrices. Due to the strong interactions of ILs with biopolymer molecules, a homogeneous sol of the biopolymer often exists in ILs. Then, by the addition of, for example, water to the biopolymer/IL solution, ionogels with physically or chemically crosslinked networks can be formed. These ionogels can absorb large amounts of water without being dissolved,145 and act as the original template to promote the biopolymer matrix formation by the following reconstitution. For example, chitin could be dissolved in 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([AMIM][Br]) at concentrations up to 5% w/w and form ion gels at higher concentrations (7% w/w). Then, this chitin ionogel was regenerated using methanol to produce a chitin nanofibre dispersion, which was used to construct a film with a highly entangled nanofibre morphology by filtration.146 By reducing the number of chemicals needed for this process to as low as two (IL and antisolvent), the potential loss of chemicals can be reduced. During these processes, ILs can be recycled upon removal of the antisolvents through evaporation,42,147 conforming to the green processing of biopolymers. The efficient recycling and reuse of ILs are indeed critical to overcome the high prices of the ILs as well as to realize the environmental benefits of ILs. In previous studies, no appreciable changes in the physical properties of the recovered ILs were observed and the recovered ILs could be reused at least four times without loss of their purity.42,114 If there was no derivatization, which is commonly the case, minor waste and no byproducts would be produced in this process. However, it has also been reported that when bases such as imidazole or 1-methylimidazole are present (e.g., as unreacted starting materials), 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium cations can react at the C2 position with cellulose at its reducing end, forming a carbon–carbon bond.148 Luckily, this unwanted side reaction can be suppressed by the absence of bases and reaction or contact times of less than 2 h.
For pharmaceutical purposes, promising delivery carriers have been reported involving films, fibres, aerogels and composites obtained from various biopolymer/IL (Table 4). Often, an adequate processing technique is needed to form a proper matrix for a drug/gene delivery system, such as the application of wet–wet electrospinning followed by an aqueous coagulation bath to prepare heparin-immobilized cellulose–Fe3O4 nanofibre composites from [EMIM][Ac].149 Notably, the application of ILs together with supercritical fluid drying (SCF) without the collapsing of the gel structure has demonstrated the possibility of developing chitin-, locust bean gum-, and cellulose-based aerogels (Table 4). In order to prepare an aerogel, an ionogel was firstly prepared by the interaction of a biopolymer with an IL. The ionogel was then treated with an alcohol to obtain an alcogel, followed by SCF to remove the alcohol (Fig. 4A). Compared with traditional drying methods (freeze- or vacuum-drying), the application of SCF prevented the shrinkage of the matrix, resulting in a porous interconnected structure (Fig. 4B and C), low densities (e.g., 0.15 to 0.41 g cm−3150) and high surface areas (e.g., 154 to 434 m2 g−162). These features make them ultralight and highly porous DDSs with a topical drug release behaviour.105,150 Additionally, SCF allows high drug saturation (e.g., about 50% w/w) and drying of the gel in a one-pot process.62 For example, the incorporation of drugs (dexamethasone) into chitin-based microsphere scaffolds could be achieved by drying the matrices for supercritical-assisted agglomeration. Results showed that, using the controlled DDSs prepared in this way, dexamethasone could be sustainably released for a time period of up to 21 days.163 Furthermore, related to the recycling of ILs, SCF technology can surpass traditional methods owing to its low cost, nontoxic nature, recoverability and ease of separation from the products.164 Admittedly, the recovery of ILs often involves the use of conventional organic solvents, which may affect the “green” aspects in their usage due to the cross-contamination. Water as a solvent would seem safe, environmentally benign, and inexpensive. Yet, the greenness of recovering the ILs from water for reuse must also be considered and this is currently energy intensive.114 To date, the IL extractions, in particular, are energy-consuming, particularly for the direct vacuum distillation protocol.42 Thus, SCFs may solve these problems by combining the green solvent (IL) with a clean technology (SCF).165 Nonetheless, the application of SCF for the recovery of ILs from biopolymer materials has scarcely been reported, which should be focused on in future studies.

Because of the extensive solvation ability of ILs, the resulting biopolymer/IL solutions can be used for the fabrication of composite materials, which are engineered materials based on two or more constituents (e.g., matrix and/or reinforcement166). For example, chitin nanofibres (20–30 nm) regenerated at the optimized concentration of 10% (wt/wt) in several acidic ILs have been used to enhance elasticity and retard the drug release of Ca-alginate beads.167 In particular, the composite retains distinct characteristics of every constituent within the finished structure,168 thereby exhibiting combined properties of its individual components. This is a promising approach to the use of natural biopolymers (Fig. 5), which can overcome the difficulty of chemically synthesizing such composites in a solution medium. For example, cellulose and chitosan were added to keratin/IL solution to obtain [cellulose/chitosan + keratin] composites with the aim of overcoming the relatively poor mechanical properties of keratin.117 Besides, due to the comparatively ordered structure (lower content of α-helices and higher content of β-sheets) of keratin retained in the composite,142 keratin can retard the drug release compared with cellulose and chitosan (random form).117 Consequently, increasing the portion of keratin in the composite led to a substantial decrease in the release kinetics (a 41% decrease in the release rate by an increase in the concentration of keratin from 10% to 30%).117 Moreover, chitosan was believed to possess not only strong mechanical properties but also additional properties including its ability to stop bleeding (haemostasis), heal wounds, and kill bacteria.114,169 Thus, the [cellulose/chitosan + keratin] composite had the combined properties of its components, namely, superior mechanical strength (cellulose), haemostasis and bactericide (chitosan), and controlled drug release (keratin).

With the advances in stimulus-responsive biopolymer-based DDSs, the demand for developing such biopolymer composites in ILs has gained worldwide attention recently. In the case of regenerated biopolymer matrices by ILs without chemical modification, the incorporation of functional components into biopolymer matrices has been proved to be powerful in endowing stimulus-responsive properties. Due to the comparatively high viscosity of ILs,76,77 a huge advantage of this method is the nanometre size and uniform distribution of the functional component in the biopolymer matrix.40 ILs are known to be effective at the dissolution of biopolymers and the suspension of functional particulates in the same IL medium.170 For example, superparamagnetic NPs (Fe3O4) (5 nm in diameter, 30 emu g−1 magnetization) were impregnated into cellulose nanofibres in [EMIM][Ac] to enable the manipulation of both dry and wet nanofibre membranes with an external magnetic field.149 Results showed that Fe3O4 NPs were distributed throughout the interior of the fibres with only a small portion of Fe3O4 NPs lying on the fibre surface. Besides, these cellulose nanofibre composites were further functionalized by heparin (an anticoagulant171), physically or covalently immobilized on the fibre surface to reduce the thrombogenicity of blood-contacting devices.149
The unique combination of the physicochemical properties of ILs with biopolymers can provide opportunities for not only in situ processability but also functionalization of materials (ionogels). One of the typical applications was bringing electrical conductivity to biopolymer materials because of the wide electrochemical window of ILs. For example, electrically sensitive chitosan films have been developed by doping with two ammonium-based ILs (choline chloride ([Ch][Cl]) and choline dihydrogen phosphate ([Ch][DHP])) for multi-responsiveness.31 These IL-based chitosan films can overcome the low electrical sensitivity and conductivity and the intrinsic “soft-material” characteristics of chitosan-based electrically responsive carrier materials.172 Compared with [Ch][Cl], the enhanced electrical conductivity with the use of [Ch][DHP] was shown (at the same loaded amount, 75%).31 The reason for this phenomenon may relate to the solid–solid phase transition characteristic of the former.173,174 Moreover, when compared with chitosan films, 75% [Ch][DHP]-loaded chitosan composites showed a clear decrease in the water swelling capacity at pH 4 (∼80%) while a small increase was observed at pH 7 (∼7%) and at pH 10 (∼10%).31 This can be explained by the “shielding” effect of [DHP] in the protonated amino groups in the acidic medium, which consequently decreased the electrostatic repulsions that would favour the swelling capacity. In contrast, at pH 7 or pH 10, the presence of [DHP] can increase the charge density inside the polymer and the osmotic charge gradient, thus increasing the swelling ability. Based on that, an ionic drug (sodium phosphate dexamethasone (DXA)) was encapsulated in 75%[Ch][DHP]-loaded chitosan composites, which showed a pH-sensitive drug release behavior (∼62% of the total loaded DXA at acidic pH compared to the DXA release values at pH 7 (∼95%) and at pH 10 (∼90%)).31 Besides, the amount of DXA released from films doped with [Ch][DHP] was always lower than that from the films without IL, indicating a dual effect of ILs on the conductivities/impedances of the films.
Apart from delivering drugs with high efficiency, biopolymer-IL composites have benefited drug detoxification, which aims at the inhibition of the side effects (e.g., toxicity and anti-inflammatory response) of drugs in their clinical applications. Heparin/cellulose/charcoal composites (2% cellulose solution of [BMIM][Cl] and 1% heparin in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium benzoate [EMIM][Ba]) have been prepared to enhance the biocompatibility and blood compatibility of activated charcoal beads,175 and furthermore to inhibit the thromboresistance caused by uncoated activated charcoal.176,177 This coating (heparin/cellulose) decreased the active pore size of the activated charcoal, thus diminishing its rate of protein adsorption (a 9% decrease in the amount of bovine serum albumin (BSA) for the coated composite and a 27% decrease for uncoated charcoal composites), without decreasing the effective removal of free-diluted and protein-bound small drug molecules.175 These composites are useful for rapid and safe removal of small, hydrophobic protein-bound drug molecules from the digestive system or from the blood of overdose patients in an extracorporeal circuit.
3.2 Chemical modifications of biopolymers in ILs
The existence of diverse functional groups allows a wide range of chemical modifications of biopolymers, leading to tailor-made matrices with different shapes, sizes and specific functionalities.4 Nevertheless, most chemical reactions performed in conventional organic solvents have limitations such as complexity and heterogeneity of the synthesis process, limited efficiency, long reaction time, serious corrosion, and environmental pollution.178,179 These issues would restrict the widespread application and large-scale production of biopolymer materials. Remarkably, these features have stimulated the use of ILs to promote homogeneous reactions and improve the reaction efficiencies (Table 4), thus creating more options to induce novel functional groups and opening up the possibility to control the total degree of substitution (DS).18 For example, ILs were exploited as reaction media in which tailor-made guar gum derivatives were synthesized through a direct and homogeneous esterification route with a variety of acid chlorides.180 Results showed that the DSs (0.12–2.70) of guar gum could be easily varied by adjusting the experimental conditions (e.g., reaction time),180 which could overcome the problem of low and uncontrolled substitution reactions of guar gum.19 These advantages of ILs as reaction media are much prominent in the chemical modification of cellulose. Due to the extremely poor solubility of cellulose in most aqueous and organic solvents and the difficulty of cellulose processing, most cellulose-based materials can only be prepared from soluble cellulose derivatives such as ethyl cellulose,181 hydroxypropyl cellulose,182 and hydroxyethyl cellulose.183 However, these soluble derivatives could increase the risk of toxicity and the costs of the products. On the other hand, the application of ILs as reaction medium allows homogeneous reactions with unmodified cellulose,44,46,184 such as the generation of biopolymer macroinitiators by esterification for further grafted biopolymer derivatives.185 Cellulose chloroacetate with the highest DS of 1.87, as a macroinitiator, can be easily synthesized by direct acylation of cellulose with chloroacetyl chloride without any catalysts under mild conditions in [BMIM][Cl].186 This will provide an effective solution to the problem of soluble cellulose derivatives. However, it should be noted that when ILs are used as reaction media to esterify cellulose, [EMIM][Ac] is not suitable since this IL can lead to unexpected side reactions. Specifically, unexpected pure cellulose acetate samples (DS: 0.55–1.86) were found in the case of a homogeneous conversion of cellulose in [EMIM][Ac] with 2-furoyl chloride, p-toluenesulfonyl chloride, and triphenylmethyl chloride.187
The high reaction efficiency achieved using ILs as media is attributed to their capability to disrupt the biopolymer structure through weakening the inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds between biopolymer chains. These interactions led to the separation of functional groups of different biopolymer chains, resulting in a homogeneous solution and facilitating the interactions between the biopolymer and external catalysts or reactants in the IL.42 In particular, in the case of grafting reactions of chitosan using ILs,46,181 both the functional groups of chitosan (–OH and –NH2) were found to participate in the reactions, which increased the grafted content and grafting efficiency. For example, a high grafting content (630%) of polycaprolactone (PCL) to chitosan was achieved by ROP in [EMIM][Ac] using stannous octoate as the catalyst,45 suggesting that imidazolium-based ILs are excellent chemical media. During chemical processes such as ring-opening polymerization (ROP),44,45,188 reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT)185 and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP),46,186 imidazolium-based ILs have been proved to be excellent media with huge advantages. For example, ILs can reduce the extent of side-reactions in ATRP, and thus obtain grafted biopolymer chains with well-controlled M and polydispersity in a mild reaction medium.186 By applying ATRP reactions, chitin-g-polystyrene from a chitin macroinitiator (DS > 1.66) was synthesized in [AMIM][Br] at 60 °C for 10 h with controlled number-average molecular mass (Mn) by adjusting the feed ratios of styrene to the initiating site of the chitin macroinitiator.18 These grafted copolymers could aggregate and self-assemble into a sphere-like polymeric structure,18,186 which is highly likely to be applied in DDSs. Moreover, studies suggested that the use of ILs as media could enhance the nucleophilicity of amines of chitosan and increase the stability of the reagent-activated complexes, thus accelerating nucleophilic substitution reactions. It would shorten the reaction time and benefit the grafting control, such as chitosan-graft-polyethylenimine (CS-g-PEI) synthesized with a high grafting degree (GD) (maximum: 8.1%) in [BMIM][Ac].189 It turned out that the grafting reaction rate was greatly accelerated by 6–30 times and the reaction time was largely shortened from 5 days or 24 h to 4 h.189 The buffering capacity of chitosan was improved by PEI grafts and increased with the GD. These CS-g-PEI/DNA complexes were stable in blood serum with suitable particle sizes (250–270 nm) and proper surface charge (higher than 40 mV).189 Moreover, for gene transfection performance, the CS-g-PEI copolymer with a medium GD of 4.3% showed low cytotoxicity and conferred the best gene transfection with a transfection efficiency 44 times that of chitosan and 38 times that of PEI-1.8 (1.8 kDa of PEI), indicating excellent potential as an efficient and safe nonviral gene vector.189
Because of the diversity and complexity of reactions, in some cases, ILs can be designed to endow the chemical processes with inherent task-specific properties. For example, instead of the protection and deprotection of amino groups before and after the synthesis of the chitosan copolymer in [BMIM][Ac] to obtain amino-reserved chitosan-g-PCL,188 ILs can restrain the reaction of the amino groups of chitosan, rendering the alkylation selectively to occur on hydroxyl groups of chitosan in [BMIM][Cl] without the protection of amino groups.190 Thus, this O-alkylated chitosan can be potentially used as a gene delivery carrier. For this, it was hypothesized that the nitrogen atoms of imidazolium-based ILs can be in the electron deficient environment, hampering the nucleophilic reaction of amino groups. Moreover, in the same chemical process, ILs can serve as a catalyst in addition to serving as dissolution and reaction media. For example, ammonium-based ILs, especially choline-based ones, have been exploited as a catalytic medium without the necessity of basic or acid catalysts. The hydrophobic silanization reaction of cellulose nanocrystals was achieved in choline lactate ([Ch][Lac]) without the addition of an external catalyst,191 which is a must as it can accelerate the hydrolysis of alkoxy groups to yield silanol groups to further react with –OH groups present on cellulose nanocrystal surfaces.192
Among all modifications, grafting hydrophobic polymers onto biopolymers to acquire amphipathic properties is regarded as the most effective method to extend the applications of functional carrier materials (e.g., nanomicelles) (Table 4). Cellulose-graft-poly(L-lactide) (CEL-g-PLA) was designed and synthesized in [BMIM][Cl],147 which could self-assemble into micelles in water with the hydrophobic PLA segments as the cores and the hydrophilic cellulose segments as the outer shells (Fig. 6). These drug-loaded micelles showed sustained drug release, which indicates their potential applicability as DDSs.147 In addition, chemical modifications can not only control the physical and delivery properties of biopolymer derivatives (e.g., solubility, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, and drug releasing ability), but also provide new functions by grafting functional polymers. For the development of stimulus-responsive DDSs in ILs, the incorporation of stimulus-sensitive polymer units into the biopolymer is an easy method to combine biopolymers with responsiveness. In turn, the addition of a biopolymer could enhance the biodegradability and biocompatibility of its copolymers. Such grafted copolymers have been developed by grafting poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) onto cellulose to prepare thermosensitive biopolymers in [AMIM][Cl]46 or by grafting poly[2-(diethylamino)-ethyl methacrylate] (PDEAEMA) onto cellulose (CEL-g-PDEAEMA) to prepare pH-sensitive biopolymers by homogeneous ATRP in [AMIM][Cl].184 The as-prepared copolymers were found to have a similar responsiveness to the stimulus-sensitive polymer units with minor modulation. For example, in the case of CEL-g-PDEAEMA, the hydrophilic PDEAEMA side chains resided mainly in the corona of the micelles, whereas the hydrophobic backbone of cellulose was mainly in the core of the micelles.184 At pH values below 6.9, the diameters of the micelles were small (Fig. 7A–C). This reduction was due to the hydrophilic tertiary amine groups of the PDEAEMA structure. Under acidic conditions (pH 5.0), the N,N′-dimethylaminoethyl groups were protonated.181 Then, at higher pH, the deprotonation of the tertiary amine groups led to a contraction of the PDEAEMA brushes, reducing the diameter of the micelles to the minimum value at pH 6.9 (Fig. 7C). However, at pH 7.4, the CEL-g-PDEAEMA side chains collapsed in the shell of micelles, leading to micelle rupture (Fig. 7D). All these results imply its potential application as a pH-sensitive biomedical material.

Stimulated by the advances in drug–polymer conjugates in DDSs, such as the high drug loading contents and the minimum side effects of drugs,1 drug–biopolymer conjugates are also exploited in ILs. Chitosan–Lilial conjugates have been prepared by combining hydrophobic payloads (Lilial as a prototype) efficiently with chitosan via Schiff base bond formation in [BMIM][Cl].153 The Schiff base bond (stable at neutral pH, but progressively hydrolyzed to break apart when the pH drops below 6)193 endowed the pH-dependent dissolution–coagulation transition of chitosan.194 This feature of the chitosan–Lilial conjugate would especially benefit cellular DDS design since the endosomal or lysosomal uptake is a gradually acidified compartmentalization process (pH = ∼6.5–4).195 Further functional modification was carried out by grafting thermoresponsive PNIPAM to the chitosan–drug conjugate (Fig. 8D). The graft copolymer was observed to self-assemble in water at neutral pH into core–shell nanocarriers with a size distribution of ∼142 ± 60 nm (Fig. 8A). At 37 °C, zero release of Lilial was observed at neutral pH, while at pH 4.5 (the conditions mimicking endosomal or lysosomal uptake), the nanocarriers formed reversed micelles (∼8 ± 3 nm) (Fig. 8B) and 70% of the drug was liberated within 30 h through the hydrolytic cleavage of the Schiff base conjugation. Based on the smart drug release profile (Fig. 8C), this strategy was deemed viable for intravenous administration of hydrophobic drugs carried by chitosan-based vehicles.

3.3 IL-assisted formation of biopolymer matrices
Modern material technology offers an intelligent approach for pharmaceutics by encapsulating drugs to carrier particles such as MPs, NPs, and liposomes, which can modulate the delivery characteristics of drugs and provide controlled release or target specificity.196 With high surface-to-volume ratios, micro-/nanoparticles can significantly increase their cellular contact, thus increasing the bioavailability of drugs. A well-designed nanoparticulate system is able to preferentially accumulate drugs at the site of interest, such as tumor1 or M cells of Peyer's patches,197 and avoid nonspecific distribution. However, its delivery performance is strongly dependent on the characteristics of the produced particles. Technical issues, such as the oversized particles, the heterogenetic distribution of particles,198 and the lack of balance between hydrophilic/hydrophobic modification of the particle surface,199 hinder the development of these biopolymer-based carriers. For example, for intravascular administration, the large size and broad size distribution of the obtained NPs may induce the clearance by reticuloendothelial system (RES) organs,1 resulting in a short blood half-life and low efficiency of drug delivery. Therefore, there is a strong incentive to develop new methods for the synthesis of micro-/nanoparticles. Recently, the versatile features of ILs drew attention to address such challenges of biopolymer-based carriers. ILs can be used in the preparation of advanced biopolymer-based DDSs for better particle properties, especially via suspension polymerization reactions.200
With the extensive choice of polarity and miscibility, ILs can be a good alternative as the polar phase (hydrophilic ILs) or nonpolar phase (hydrophobic ILs) in the microemulsion process.201,202 These IL-microemulsions have been tested successfully to prepare biopolymer-based NPs (Table 4), which can overcome the size issue of NPs prepared by the traditional water (W)/oil (O) microemulsion-crosslinking technique.203 In these microemulsions, ILs played an indispensable role in the formation of NPs, since such stable microemulsions were not obtainable with common organic solvents.204 Results showed that starch NPs can be prepared with epichlorohydrin as the crosslinker through an IL/O (1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([OMIM][Ac]) as the polar phase (Fig. 9A)) or a W/IL (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIM][PF6]) as the oil phase154) microemulsion-crosslinking reaction. The obtained starch NPs were spherical with a small mean diameter (e.g., 91.4 nm154 and 96.9 nm205) and a narrow size distribution. The drug release tests showed an initial burst release followed by a sustained release of 79.95% of the model drug within 10 hours.154 However, due to the strong van der Waals forces and electrostatic attractions between particles,206 most of these starch NPs showed aggregation or cluster formation (Fig. 9B), which could limit their application in drug delivery. In order to decrease this aggregation, octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) starch was used as the raw material because of its hydrophobicity (Fig. 9C). 1-(3-Hydroxypropyl)-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C3OHMIM][Ac]) was tailor-made to serve as the polar phase, combining the surfactant (polyethylene glycol octylphenol ether), the cosurfactant (1-butanol), and the oil phase (cyclohexane), to prepare a nonaqueous IL-microemulsion.156 The mean diameter of the acquired particles was 86.69 nm and no clusters of starch NPs was observed.

Due to the unique interfaces of microdroplets in ILs, simple and rational methods for preparing biopolymer-encapsulated protein microcapsules have been developed. When using microemulsions to prepare protein microcapsules, the O/W type has always been adopted;207,208 however, the inner oil droplets are not suitable to dissolve water-soluble guest biopolymers. This issue can be addressed by taking advantage of ILs. Besides, the microcapsules formed in the IL phase can be easily extracted to the aqueous phase after consecutive crosslinking and surface modification reactions; thus, the whole process can be carried out in one pot.209 It was found that the capsule-forming (host) proteins such as BSA and β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) could rapidly form microcapsules at the W/ILs interface under mild conditions, while the guest biopolymers (e.g., enzymes) remain quantitatively encapsulated in the inner aqueous pool (Fig. 10). As a result, BSA microcapsules with diameters of 7–15 μm were observed, whereas red-blood-cell-like flattened microcapsules (diameter, 2–7 μm) were observed for β-Lg. This difference was related to the number of charged residues on protein surfaces, that is, the proportion of lysine residues contained in these two proteins.209 Besides, enzymes confined in the inner water phase of aqueous protein microcapsules showed innate activity, suggesting the success of this novel method to prepare protein microcapsules with an effective protection of bioactive substances.

In recent years, surfactant ILs have emerged as substitutes for traditional surfactants to stabilize IL-microemulsions, particularly for surface-active ionic liquids (SAILs) with long-chain alkyl groups in their cations.81 For example, 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([C16MIM][Br]) was found to act as the surfactant in the microemulsions to prepare starch NPs.155,157 SAILs, especially imidazolium-based SAILs, possess superior surface activity over the conventional analogous surfactants in aqueous and nonaqueous media. This is because of the existence of imidazolium head groups, which display significantly superior properties such as a stronger tendency toward self-aggregation and stronger attraction to aromatic rings through π–π interactions.210–212 Altogether, ILs can play versatile roles in the emulsion process. As an example, starch NPs can be prepared in a dual-ILs-based microemulsion system with [C16MIM][Br] and [OMIM][Ac] simultaneously used as the surfactant and the polar phase, respectively.157 Compared with the previously obtained starch NPs in the IL-microemulsions,154,205 these starch NPs had smaller particle sizes with a mean diameter of 80.5 nm, which may be due to the nonpolar part of the ILs, acting as a surfactant helping to stabilize the suspended phase. Besides, ILs may induce electrostatic charges on the surfaces of polymer particles to keep them from coalescence.200
3.4 Physical interactions of biopolymers with ILs
Because of its tremendous sources from animals, plants, and microorganisms, biopolymers with particular structural features (such as carboxyl groups of alginic acid116 and amino groups of chitosan36) exhibit huge potential for the development of supramolecular polymers for drug/gene delivery purposes. These biopolymers can self-assemble into supramolecular complexes by blending with the counterpart molecules with sophisticated structures and functions. This could lead to, for example, pH-responsive drug delivery carriers based on chitosan polyelectrolyte complexes.213 Another typical example is cyclodextrins (CDs). They have a structure with a hollow truncated cone, the interior of which forms a relatively hydrophobic cavity.214 Thus, CDs have been extensively studied in supramolecular chemistry as host molecules. CDs are capable of containing guest molecules ranging from small organic/inorganic compounds to polymers through hydrophobic interactions to form supramolecular complexes.215–217 Such interactions can provide a delicate balance that is expected to yield interesting soft matter phases. On the other hand, results showed that ILs can also self-assemble into highly structural nanomaterials.81 Therefore, for the application of pharmaceutical formulations, the use of biopolymer-IL combinations for colloidal supramolecular complexes can be of high interest.
It is well known that traditional surfactants are capable of interacting with biopolymers to form various self-assembled nanostructures.218,219 Motivated by this strategy to enrich biopolymer materials, surfactant ILs can be exploited in conjugation with biopolymers to maximize their use in colloidal formulations and to understand the fundamental nature of interactions existing in such systems. For example, inclusion complexes can be formed with the supramolecular assembly of β-CD as the host and SAIL as the guest,220,221 such as vesicles prepared in a concentrated aqueous solution of 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([C12MIM][Br]) and β-CD.221 Usually, surfactant ILs can outperform traditional surfactants in the formation of nanomaterials.159 Besides, IL-type imidazolium Gemini surfactants can also be used to prepare supramolecular matrices with biopolymers. These imidazolium Gemini surfactants are usually made up of two hydrophobic chains and two hydrophilic imidazolium head groups covalently linked through a spacer group,210 such as [C14-4-C14IM][Br2].222 Driven by the hydrogen bonds between β-CDs, between β-CD and the imidazolium head group of [C14-4-C14IM]2+, and between β-CD and the solvent, and the hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic chains of [C14-4-C14IM][Br2], two-component hydrogels were formed (Fig. 11). Interestingly, due to the temperature-sensitive formation of hydrogen bonds between β-CD and [C14-4-C14IM][Br2], the properties of these hydrogels were responsive to external temperature and can be controlled by changing the host/guest ratio.222 By increasing the temperature, the hydrogels changed into solutions and this process was reversible and reproducible, which made these hydrogels potential injectable DDSs.210,222 Yet, compared with traditional surfactants, surfactant ILs have received less attention in their interactions with biopolymers.

Intermolecular noncovalent interactions have been found to be the driving force for the formation of biopolymer-IL supramolecular complexes (Table 4). In a system of biopolymer–IL combination, these interactions often coexist and have a synergistic effect on the formation of colloidal IL-contained biopolymer materials. For instance, cooperative interactions of SAILs (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium octylsulfate ([BMIM][C8OSO3]), and 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([OMIM][Cl])) with chitosan resulted in a facile preparation of uniformly distributed chitosan NPs with excellent sphericity.158 Specifically, at a low concentration, chitosan-IL aggregates were formed via ion dipole, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions. Nonetheless, above the critical micelle concentration (CMC), chitosan–IL aggregates grew further and formed chitosan-directed micelles due to electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. In this process, IL aggregates acted as a structure-directing template (Fig. 12). Moreover, in the case of the chitosan–[OMIM][Cl] system, the interaction behaviour was almost similar to that of classical nonionic polymer/anionic surfactant systems where the hydrophobic and ion-dipole forces played a major role rather than electrostatic interactions.223,224 Nevertheless, strong electrostatic interactions existed between the [C8OSO3] anion and positively charged chitosan chains, which made chitosan chain contraction significantly higher in the chitosan–[BMIM][C8OSO3] system.158 This indicates the ease and flexibility of supramolecular particle preparation with controlled properties by changing the ion type and the alkyl chain length of ILs in biopolymer science.

As a replacement for biological viral vectors, nonviral gene carriers have been extensively applied in the field of gene therapy. So far, DNA gels, which promise to serve as gene vectors, have attracted much attention. In aqueous dispersion solutions, DNA can interact with polymers to form DNA/polymer complexes by self-assembly, which are rich in soft matter phases and give rise to a wide range of morphologies.225,226 Inspired by these DNA gels, the interactions of ILs with nucleic acids have generated considerable interest in the recent past,227,228 which can be taken advantage of to form DNA gels to enlarge its application as gene delivery vehicles. Ionogels can occur automatically from the addition of ILs into DNA solutions, such as DNA ionogels from the IL solution ([EMIM][Cl]), which only costed 260 s of gelation time for 5% IL concentration. This is an easy and simple method with the use of ILs for the preparation of gene vectors. Results showed that the whole process was driven mostly by electrostatic interactions from the positively charged imidazolium head groups of IL molecules and the negatively charged phosphate groups of DNA.32 Moreover, the radius of DNA gels usually increased due to the incorporation of IL molecules onto the surface of DNA.32,229 Yet, gene delivery is a complicated process, for which there are several systematic and cellular barriers to overcome, such as the slow diffusion of hydrophilic DNA across the hydrophobic lipid bilayer membrane, and the slight electrostatic repulsion due to anionic DNA and the anionic head groups of the bilayer membrane.230 Thus, to improve the gene transformation efficiency, comparatively hydrophobic ILs was preferred to be crafted with DNA to efficiently transfer DNA across the bilayer membrane and prevent enzymatic damage. For example, hydrophobic IL ([BMIM][PF6]) was chosen to form self-assembled nanostructures (69.5 nm) with plasmid DNA of various ratios.229 It was found that the cationic groups ([BMIM]+) not only were bound parallel to the surface but also were arranged on the surface of DNA (Fig. 13B), therefore changing the B-form conformation of DNA.231 These nanostructures can enhance the rate of uptake of DNA molecules into the cell and protect DNA from physicochemical and biological destruction (Fig. 13A). In particular, DNA-IL nanostructures were found to enhance the efficiency of transformation by 3- to 4-fold as compared to that of pure plasmid DNA.229 Moreover, SAILs can be applied to enhance the interactions between ILs and DNA to improve the transfection efficiency. In this case, the aggregation of SAIL on DNA chains was usually initiated not only by electrostatic attractions but also by hydrophobic interactions (Table 4). Furthermore, because of the steric hindrance of the long side chains of SAIL cations, the hydrophobic interactions were the main driving force to bind with DNA, enhance DNA condensation, and promote the transfection process of IL-DNA complexes.160 This can be verified using imidazolium-based ILs with different alkyl side chain lengths (ethyl, butyl, and hexyl).232 As expected, the increase in the length of hydrophobic alkyl chains in the cationic group was found to enhance the binding capacity with DNA, with the preference for long alkyl side chains (ethyl < butyl < hexyl).232 Thus, the self-assembly process of SAILs with DNA was rather a result of their hydrophobicity. Interestingly, unlike small-molecule ILs,32,229 surfactant ILs can reduce the charge repulsion by binding to DNA backbones, leading to the compaction of DNA and smaller sizes of DNA–SAIL complexes compared with native DNA.119,160 This compaction of DNA helped to cross cell membranes,160,233 thus improving the efficacy of gene therapy.

Surfactant IL-DNA complexes can particularly favour transdermal drug delivery, since the surfactant ILs may act as a penetration enhancer to improve skin-permeating ability, which is the main limit of the efficiency of transdermal DDSs.49 For instance, therapeutic RNA robed with IL moieties (benzyl dimethyl octyl ammonium (BDOA)) was exploited as a simple, scalable prodrug platform to treat skin disease.234 Skin transport of this therapeutic RNA was significantly enhanced by robing with BDOA, with a higher applied dose delivered into the viable epidermis (9.85 ± 2.64%) compared to only 2.06 ± 0.15% for naked RNA. Besides, compared to naked siRNA, cell internalization was enhanced by robing with IL moieties. All the results verified its excellent transport to the deep viable skin layers (epidermis and dermis), its ability to improve cell internalization, and its superior biocompatibility.234 In addition, if a new functional group is introduced into a surfactant IL, new structures and properties of the surfactant IL-DNA complexes may be produced. Efforts have been made to developing the multifunctional surfactant IL-DNA complexes. For example, photodynamic therapy and gene transportation were achieved simultaneously by introducing the photoactive isoquinolinium ring into the ILs to synthesize the photoactive IL surfactants (lauryl isoquinolinium bromide, [C12iQuin][Br]).160 At a low concentration, the photoactive isoquinolinium ring of [C12iQuin][Br], which was an AT-specific minor groove binder, would be arranged to face the plane of the minor groove of DNA, and the hydrophobic tails of [C12iQuin][Br] would be arranged parallel to the minor groove (Fig. 14). As a result, DNA molecules were strongly compacted at a low [C12iQuin][Br] concentration. Subsequently, they underwent a complete coil-to-globule structure transition upon further addition of [C12iQuin][Br].160 This unique binding mode of [C12iQuin][Br] on DNA caused the formation of new photoactive structures of complexes, which would promote novel applications in photodynamic therapy or gene transportation.

3.5 Biopolymeric ILs
Due to its unique biological properties (Fig. 2), ILs themselves can be potential for DDSs in the form of IL-based drug formulations (e.g., active pharmaceutical ingredient ILs) or anticancer and antimicrobial agents.47 Given the wide variety of ions available, it is not difficult to prepare ILs to acquire specific functions. However, there are rare data available about these functional ILs. Thus, much attention is needed to prepare biopolymeric ILs, which can be considered as a promising candidate in the pharmaceutical industry. Moreover, the combination of biologically relevant compounds can improve the biocompatibility of the systems. Imidazolium or pyridinium-based ILs demonstrate significantly higher antimicrobial and antitumor activities than other ILs,235,236 and can be exploited as antimicrobial and antitumor substances in the pharmaceutical industry. As a result, early efforts have been dedicated to developing these antimicrobial and anticancer biopolymeric ILs. For example, a series of biopolymeric chitosan Schiff bases bearing salicylidene IL (IL-Sal) brushes and its metal complexes (Fig. 15) were developed as pharmacological candidates. The azomethine linkage (CN) in these Schiff base composites showed stupendous biocidal efficacy (including antibacterial, antifungal, and antitumor activities),237 which could contribute to its antimicrobial and anticancer properties.238 The designed biopolymeric chitosan Schiff bases exhibited antitumor activities against the human colon carcinoma (HCT-116) cell line and further metallization could enhance its antitumor activities significantly.238 Moreover, these biopolymeric ILs and their metal complexes had moderate to excellent broad-spectrum antibacterial efficacy in comparison with the parent chitosan and standard antibiotics, with an ability to inhibit the growth of Aspergillus flavus < Candida albicans < Escherichia coli < Staphylococcus aureus.238

4 Toxicity and degradability of ILs for green carrier materials
The evaluation of the cytotoxicity and degradability of a biomaterial is the initial step when considering their practical and clinical applications. Normally, biopolymer-based DDSs could guarantee high biocompatibility and biodegradation.239,240 Thus, concerning the exploitation of ILs as highly promising solvents and/or materials for pharmaceutical applications, it is critical to assess the impact of ILs in terms of their cytotoxicity, biodegradability, bioaccumulation and environmental fate.
As for the impact of ILs on living organisms and the environment, toxicity studies have been carried out by performing a series of tests on enzyme activity (e.g., acetylcholinesterase241,242), bacteria and fungi (e.g., Escherichia coli243), algae (e.g., Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata244), cell viability (e.g., HeLa cells,245 CaCo-2 cells246), vascular plant (e.g., wheat Triticum aestivum247 and duckweed Lemna minor248), invertebrates (e.g., Daphnia magna244), and vertebrates (e.g., Zebrafish,243 rats and mice249). In general, depending on the model system for acute toxicity testing, ILs showed moderate to high toxicity, in some cases, equal to or even two to four orders of magnitude higher than those of conventional organic solvents, such as benzene, methanol, DMF or propan-2-ol.33,34,250 It has been found that the toxicity of ILs was mainly determined by the molecular structure (mostly due to the species and structural features of cations),251 and special care should be taken in the design of ILs. When it comes to certain species of cations, the imidazolium cation showed the highest toxicity, whereas the ammonium cation demonstrated the lowest toxicity.251 Besides, the hydrophobicity, which corresponds to the increasing alkyl chain length of the IL cation, was found to induce rising toxicity.252,253 The toxicity mechanism of ILs is not yet fully understood, but it has been proposed that the mode of toxic action takes place through membrane disruption. Specifically, the long alkyl chains increase the possibility of their interactions with cell membrane phospholipid bilayers and hydrophobic domains of membrane proteins, leading to disruption of membrane physiological functions and, consequently, to cell death.254 Thus, increasing the hydrophilicity and polarity by introducing functional groups (e.g., ether, hydroxyl or nitrile functions) into the IL cations can decrease its toxicity.255 So far, the toxicity mechanism of the anionic part has been less understood, although the toxicity of anions, such as PF6 and BF4, has been proposed to be the reason. Due to their hydrolysis and formation of fluorides, they may act as potential inhibitors of Na+, K+ ATPase, which could be involved in the maintenance of static electric potential stations and transport and the regulation of cell volume.256
Nevertheless, as far as the biodegradability of ILs is concerned, it is notable that the goal of biodegradability inherently conflicts with the design of biocompatible ILs. For example, although IL cations with a short alkyl chain showed low toxicity, these ILs have been proven to resist biodegradation.257 In fact, the biodegradability of ILs is highly dependent on the side chains. Good biodegradability was observed in ILs with longer alkyl side chains (>C6) at the cationic core, whereas the same head cationic groups with shorter side chains were only poorly biodegradable.258 On the other hand, unlike biocompatibility, the nature of the anions was proven to play a significant role in the biodegradability of ILs; that is, the longer the linear-chain anions, the higher was the biodegradability.47 High biodegradability activity was also observed for ILs with the pyridinium head group and the introduction of polar functional groups (e.g., ether, hydroxyl or nitrile functions).35,259 Furthermore, different anions based on acetate, sulphate, and phosphate groups could also be readily biodegradable and considered nontoxic.
Despite the increasing understanding of the biological properties of ILs, the toxicity of ILs and their biodegradation routes in the human body have not been fully understood. Yet, regarding the clinical applications for the treatment of various diseases, it is critical to understand and guarantee the biocompatibility of biopolymer materials prepared by ILs. Thus, in most cases of biopolymer-based carrier materials where ILs were not involved in the matrices but only acted as solvents and reaction media, ILs were removed from the resulting matrices to eliminate their potential toxicity.42,142,143,147 The IL removal process can be achieved using solvent dilution and wash,62,175,260 or Soxhlet extraction.43,45,112,153 For example, Soxhlet extraction or the combination of Soxhlet extraction and SCF has been applied to eliminate [BMIM][Ac] from chitosan–silk48 and chitin gels.100 The efficient removal of ILs could be detected by the colour change of the matrix from yellowish to transparent when coloured ILs were used,100,163 or by the progressive decrease in the conductivity during the extraction process.100 Yet, the methods commonly used for the removal of ILs are energy-intensive and time-consuming,48,112 and the disposal of ILs after removal from biopolymer matrices has not been discussed. Only a few studies considered IL recycling and reuse,42,117 even though these aspects are vital for the economic, environmental and toxicity considerations about ILs. Therefore, it is important to develop techniques for the removal and recycling of ILs for the green chemistry of biopolymer materials. After IL removal, the biocompatibility of the prepared matrices and copolymers was confirmed, which showed no or negligible in vitro cytotoxicity.48,103,107,112,166,188,261,262 For instance, no apparent inhibition effect of 3T3 fibroblasts was observed when the concentration of the cellulose-g-PLA copolymer was below 700 mg L−1.147 ILs did not cause any deleterious effect on cell viability, which in turn suggests efficient IL removal from the chitin structures.100,263 Nonetheless, for those matrices in which ILs participate through physical interactions or chemical synthesis, ILs remained in the biopolymer materials. While some biopolymeric ILs have already been studied for the development of antimicrobials and pharmaceuticals, the biocompatibility of a much wider range of biopolymer–IL composites should be assured, especially with those SAILs with long alkyl side chains and fluoride ILs. No toxicity to E. coli DH5α cells was found for a self-assembled functional nanostructure of DNA with [BMIM][PF6].229 Moreover, when robed with BDOA, negligible cytotoxicity of RNA was observed (up to 300 nM compared with cells incubated with the medium alone).234 Yet, up to now, the toxicity data of all biopolymer-based carrier materials processed in ILs were rare and came only from in vitro tests, especially those with ILs as a component. There remains a scope for further investigation of the overall toxicity of these IL-biopolymer composites and materials.
To increase the number of environmentally friendly IL candidates, there has been an effort to develop biodegradable and biocompatible ILs, in particular for biomedical applications. To obtain “fully green” ILs, the starting materials must be at least nontoxic, whilst for a perfect solution, they should even be renewable to overcome the petroleum and toxic feedstock of traditional IL raw materials.264 Biorenewable natural compounds are ideal materials from the viewpoints of both environmental and economic concern, since these ILs can be synthesized via a simple neutralization reaction to reduce the energy input, with water as the only byproduct.265 ILs can be prepared from sugars, amino acids, and biomolecules that exist in Nature.266,267 These novel compounds have unique physicochemical properties quite close to those of common ILs, which make them applicable in various industrial processes. Among them, amino acid-based and choline-based ILs are considered to be the most promising and safe ILs to be used in the development of pharmaceutical and medical applications.31 Despite the high potential of these biocompatible ILs, there are only a few studies on their application in biopolymer materials.123,191 For example, [Ch][Cl] and [Ch][DHP] were used to prepare electrical and pH-sensitive chitosan-based materials for improved drug delivery.31 Furthermore, a new generation of liquid salts based on mixtures of a nontoxic quaternary ammonium salt (e.g., choline chloride) and an uncharged hydrogen-bond donor (e.g., amines, amides, alcohols and carboxylic acids),268,269 which are called deep eutectic solvents (DESs), have recently gained attention. The interaction of the hydrogen-bond donor with the salt reduces the anion–cation electrostatic force, and thus, the freezing point of the mixture decreases.270 The syntheses of these compounds proceed simply by mixing two safe components, which are capable of forming a eutectic mixture, without the use of additional solvents and the formation of byproducts. This could result in easily biodegradable products with lower associated costs.271 This new generation of liquid salts, DESs, have been used as solvents for the production of biopolymer matrices for DDSs such as choline chloride–thiourea.167 Chitin nanofibres of diameter 20–30 nm could be obtained using the DESs (choline chloride/thiourea = 1:2) with a yield of 84% (w/w). After the addition of these chitin nanofibres, calcium alginate bionanocomposite gel beads were able to release about 70% of the drug after 24 h at pH 7.4, showing the slow release ability of these composites.167 Moreover, DESs can be formed by bioactive compounds or pharmaceutical ingredients. A controlled DDS was developed by impregnating a starch/PCL polymeric blend with a menthol:ibuprofen therapeutic DES after SCF sintering.272 Drug release studies showed that the cumulative mass of drug released was higher with a high content (20 wt%) of the therapeutic DES incorporated. This demonstrates the feasibility to couple green technologies for the development of enhanced biomaterials for pharmaceutical applications.272 Yet, the application of natural ILs and DESs in biopolymer materials is still a new field of research that has not been extensively explored. More effort is highly necessary to make full use of multifunctional ILs for pharmaceutics applications.
5 Conclusion and future prospects
The application of ILs in biopolymer-based carrier materials for pharmaceutics has undergone a veritable explosion of interest in recent years. ILs are claimed to be effective at constructing biopolymer-based DDSs. There are three main roles of ILs in the construction of biopolymer materials for drug/gene delivery applications. Firstly, ILs have been demonstrated to be highly capable as excellent solvents and/or catalytic media for the dissolution, processability, and functionalization of biopolymers to generate a variety of matrices based on green chemistry and engineering. In addition, ILs can participate in the microemulsions as the polar/nonpolar phase and/or surfactants to prepare uniform and small-sized biopolymer NPs. Furthermore, because of the unique physicochemical and biological properties of ILs, biopolymer-based DDSs and drug formulations can be achieved with ILs as material components by means of physical interactions of ILs with biopolymers or chemical synthesis of ILs with active biocompounds. Overall, the application of green process principles, herein represented by the use of ILs, in the creation of high-value-added biopolymer materials has promoted a wide, sustainable use of biopolymers, which promises new application possibilities in drug/gene delivery.
Despite the promising results achieved for biopolymer-based DDSs,273,274 research on biopolymer-based carrier materials prepared with ILs for pharmaceutical applications has just been started. This field is still in its infancy and improvement of the currently developed systems is urgently needed. For example, despite the huge advances in carrier materials in DDSs,1 there are limited data on IL-assisted biopolymer-based carriers with stimulus-responsiveness, not to mention target-specificity, to protect the drug/gene from destruction and to control the drug release at the specific body parts or targeted cells. Secondly, compared with ILs as the dissolution and reaction media, the function of ILs to assist or participate in the formation of matrices needs to be further exploited. Thirdly, while ILs have been found to be effective in dissolving drug molecules that are sparingly soluble in water and most pharmaceutically accepted organic solvents,275,276 this huge advantage of ILs has not been exploited for the preparation of biopolymer materials. Future effort should be dedicated to preparing biopolymer-based DDSs in ILs while overcoming the difficulties in delivery of poorly soluble drugs with the assistance of ILs.277 Moreover, no research has been reported regarding the in vivo biocompatibility and biodegradation of biopolymer-based carrier materials prepared in ILs, which, however, is a prerequisite for the pharmaceutics and clinical applications of these next-generation materials.
Last but not least, the completely green aspects related to the utilization of ILs in biopolymer materials need to be highly concerned and developed as follows. Firstly, new raw materials and methods for the synthesis as well as the recycling and reuse of ILs are highly needed for the environmentally friendly and cost-effective production of biopolymer materials. Secondly, the physics and chemistry involved in the processing of biopolymers should be understood at the mechanistic level so that the processes can be improved with higher versatility. Specifically, mild dissolution temperature, reduced dissolution time, higher solubility, and the ability to treat a wider range of raw biopolymers are desired. Thirdly, while only limited data have been concerned about the total removal of ILs from biopolymer materials, more emphasis should be put on the residual ILs based on the present removal methods, and their potential influence on the properties (especially biocompatibility) of biopolymers. The application of ILs will only be achieved if the advantages of ILs outweigh their drawbacks, most prominently the prices of ILs relative to the value of the material processed by these ILs.
