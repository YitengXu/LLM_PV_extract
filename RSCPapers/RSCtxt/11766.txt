In this case, as a kind of well-defined inorganic nanocluster composed of early transition metals and oxygen atoms, polyoxometalates (POMs) are appropriate precursors to generate such emerging early transition metal based electrode materials. Benefiting from the inherent diversiform structures of POMs, the abundant metals and oxygen atoms in these inorganic clusters can not only supply metals, but can also provide the possibility for constructing porous architectures by releasing oxygen atoms during the pyrolysis process. Furthermore, there are advantageous synergistic effects when POMs are composited with other matrix precursors (such as polymers or carbon materials). On the other hand, the inherent heteroatoms of POMs can conveniently offer various kinds of heteroatom-doping (such as doping with P, Si, Ge, Se, or Sb) for the final electrode materials, which can further improve the electrochemical performances by their lone pair electrons or empty orbitals. Recently, such POM-derived electrode materials have attracted widespread attention primarily because of the convenient synthesis. This kind of effort provides the possibility to significantly alleviate the common problems of metal-based electrode materials, such as fast capacity decay, volume change, or phase transformation. In this review, the latest relevant research studies focusing on POM derivatives for rechargeable batteries are systematically summarized, including their syntheses, structures, electrochemical performances, and charge-storage mechanisms. Remarks on the challenges and future prospects of such POM-derived materials are also discussed and proposed, providing an emerging vision for the rational design and construction of novel electrode materials towards rechargeable batteries.Bo HuangBo Huang was born in 1995 in Wuhan, China.

1. Introduction
Much effort has been devoted to help solving the energy crisis during these decades, but the challenges we face are still difficult tasks.1–3 The modernization and development of the world economy greatly benefit from the extensive investment of fossil energy. However, oil, natural gas, and coal resources will rapidly approach limits of depletion at the present level of utilization.4 Although there are numerous explorations for energy devices from renewable and clean resources (such as wind, tide, and solar), intermittency and regional differences of these resources always restrict their widespread application.5–8 In recent years, electronic devices have become increasingly popular and the demand for these devices has accelerated because of their positive contributions to our daily life.9 However, flaws like low capacity bring immediate obstacles to the in-depth development and application of these electronic products. Therefore, a lot of effort has been made to develop novel electrode materials with high capacity.10–14 Among these electrode materials, early transition metal Mo-, W-, or V-based composites (such as metal oxides (MOs),15–25 metal sulphides (MSs),26–32 metal carbides (MCs),33–37 metal phosphides (MPs),38–40 and metal nitrides (MNs)41–43) are promising candidates for electrode materials because of their rich structural diversity, desirable thermal stability, and multi-electron reactions in rechargeable batteries.44–51 A number of strategies have been adopted to prepare the above materials, in which simple metal salts are commonly employed as the metal precursors. Interestingly, recent research studies indicate that polyoxometalates (POMs) can also be exploited as precursors to synthesize Mo-, W-, or V-based electrode materials, and such POM-derived hybrid materials have been reported like a storm surge recently on account of their surprising performances in rechargeable batteries.52–54
POMs are kinds of special inorganic clusters with various topological structures, which usually consist of early transition metals coordinated with oxygen atoms through co-angle, co-edge, or co-planar mode.55–58 The general formula of POM anions is [XxMyOz]n–, where M is the transition metal (such as MoVI, WVI, VV,VI, NbV, or TaV) and X is the heteroatom (such as P, Si, Ge, Se, or Sb).59–62 According to their compositions, POMs can be divided into two categories: heteropolyoxometalates and isopolyoxometalates. Heteropolyoxometalates are composed of metal oxyacid ions and heteroatoms, such as [PMo12O40]3– (PMo12) or [SiW12O40]4– (SiW12), having been widely explored since 1826.63,64 On the other hand, isopolyoxometalates are composed of the same kind of metal oxyacid ion, such as [W6O19]2– or [V10O28]6–, possessing high negative charge and symmetry.65,66 Relying on the diverse connections, POMs have derived a series of classical configurations (such as Anderson-type,67 Lindqvist-type,68 Keggin-type,69 Dawson-type,70 Silverton-type,71 and Waugh-type72) and numerous fascinating cluster architectures (such as annular, spherical, and wheel-shaped structures).73–80 The synthetic procedures of POMs are always simple (even having only one step for some POMs) and the raw materials are commercially cheap. The main strategy is to adjust the aqueous solution of metal-oxide salts to acidic, while lacunary POMs (such as lacunary Keggin- or Dawson-type POMs) can be prepared by adding additional alkaline solution.81–83 Regulating the cations of POMs also seems to be an assisting method for their synthesis, because the counter cations influentially impact the solubility and stability of POMs. The original cations usually come from the oxyacid salts (such as Na+, K+, and NH4+), but additional alkylammonium (e.g. tetramethylammonium and tetrabutylammonium) salts are commonly chosen to improve stability and for further use in organic solvents.84
Apart from their diverse structures and convenient preparation, POMs have been explored with interest for about 200 years on account of their excellent redox reversibility, strong Brønsted acidity, diverse charge characterizations, and extensive applications in photochemistry, magnetism, catalysis, gas absorption, biochemistry, and energy storage.85–94 Furthermore, POMs can be functionalized by organic components,95,96 which is an important clue to design advanced POM-based materials, achieving synergetic effects between POMs and organic groups.97 For example, organic ligands can be covalently attached to POMs so that diverse POM-based organic–inorganic hybrid materials can be easily obtained.98–100 These hybrid materials have been employed as amphiphilic catalysts, photocatalysts, and inorganic amino acids.101–103 POMs can also be introduced into many kinds of polymers (such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) or porous organic polymers (POPs)) for greater functionalization and applications.104–106 Among these POM-based polymers, POMs are used as the guest molecules or linkers to build MOFs or POPs by immersion or coordinate linkages, and the obtained composites can exhibit enhanced properties in the fields of catalysis, proton conduction and solid-state electrolytes by means of the ordered dispersion of POM molecules in the architectures.107–110 Additionally, by virtue of the reversible redox properties, POMs are widely incorporated into conductive supports (such as conducting polymers including polypyrrole and polyaniline, and carbon nanomaterials including nanotubes and graphene) through π–π interaction, electrostatic interaction, or covalent functionalization, and the resulting composites exhibit superior electrochemical performances in energy storage.111–116
More importantly, POMs can serve as promising precursors to prepare metal-based composites for a variety of applications, mainly due to their convenient synthesis, low cost, and highly redox-active metal elements.117–123 For example, highly dispersed WN nanoparticles originating from Keggin-type SiW12 are excellent catalysts for methanol electro-oxidation.117 Nb2O5 and Ta2O5 thin films prepared from Lindqvist-type POMs offer a new approach for construction of novel inorganic materials on the molecular scale.118 Khan et al. developed a TiO2/WO3 heterostructure with good photocatalytic properties from an (NH4)10H2W12O42 (W12O42) precursor.119 Wang and co-workers prepared a counter electrode of a dye-sensitized solar cell by using dicyandiamide and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (Mo7O24) precursors.121 A fully substituted polyorganoimido-POM designed by Wei and co-workers exhibits excellent electrochemical performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) after a carbonization process.123 Interestingly, our group has developed a scalable and general method to produce in-plane porous reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through carbothermal reaction of POM precursors and rGO sheets, and the pore size of rGO can be controlled by adjusting the amount of POMs.124 In our research, POMs served as the nano-scale etchers. Firstly, the POM precursor is converted to metal oxide nanoparticles through thermal decomposition. In the following process, the metal oxide nanoparticles deposited on rGO sheets react with their carbon neighbours to generate carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide at high temperature. After that a number of pores or defects are formed on rGO sheets, and thus porous rGO with nano-scaled in-plane pores are obtained. As mentioned above, many instances have fully confirmed that POMs are highly valuable precursors for the preparation of functional materials.
Recently, applications of POM-derived Mo-, W-, or V-based materials towards energy storage have emerged and bloomed, showing an escalating trend because the electrode materials originating from POM precursors have a positive effect in alleviating the serious issues of transition metal-based electrode materials in terms of volume change and low lifetime.125–133 Currently, three strategies are usually used to synthesize these POM derivatives, mainly including the hydrothermal/solvothermal method, annealing method, and electrodeposition.134–136 The above-mentioned methods generally involve four categories: (1) only the POM itself as a precursor; (2) self-assembled precursors of POMs with various organic molecules (such as glucose, urea, L-cysteine, melamine, dopamine, thiourea, phytic acid, thioacetamide, and ethylenediamine); (3) polymers (such as conductive polymers, MOFs, and POPs) with entrapped POMs as co-precursors; (4) carbon nanomaterials (such as nanotubes and graphene) with immersed POMs as co-precursors.
According to the type of precursor, different methods are applied to prepare POM-derived electrode materials. For example, under hydrothermal conditions, Mo7O24 can be directly converted to MoO3 nanobelts by electrophilic addition of H+ and a subsequent dehydration reaction.137 Similarly, in the hydrothermal process, MSs can be easily synthesized through the reaction of POMs and S2− generated by the decomposition of thiourea or L-cysteine. When the annealing method is applied to dispose POM precursors, the self-pyrolysis of POMs occurs at high temperature and MOs are obtained at the same time. In this high temperature process, organic molecules or polymers of the co-precursors are gradually decomposed into carbon materials with diversified heteroatom-doping (e.g., N, S, and P) in an inert atmosphere, and further provide the conductive supports for metal-based materials. Meanwhile, POM-derived MOs might react with breakdown products of organic molecules or polymers to form MSs, MCs, MPs, MNs, etc. Additionally, the use of extrinsic reagents can also help POM precursors transform into metal-based composites during the annealing process. As an example, when sulfur or NaH2PO2 is placed in the upstream region of a tube furnace and keeps a certain distance with POM precursors, MSs or MPs can be obtained via the sulfuration or phosphorization of the metals by the generated sublimed sulfur or PH3. MSs and MNs can also be prepared by annealing POM precursors in a H2S and an NH3 atmosphere, respectively.
Taking advantage of co-precursors, the ion-insertion kinetics and cycling stability of the final obtained electrode materials could be effectively improved.138–140 This is most possibly due to the appropriate structures of the final electrode materials. For example, the porous structures generated from the reaction of POM-derived MO particles and their carbon neighbours can contribute to alleviating the volume and structure changes during Li+ insertion and de-insertion. Moreover, the co-precursors of POMs and MOFs or POPs are anticipated to restrict the aggregation of active particles and yield high-performance materials with a porous structure and high specific surface area.141 In addition, the synergistic effects are highly desirable to facilitate ion diffusion and charge transfer of electrode materials, when POMs are integrated with graphene or nanotubes.142
As referred to above, there are apparent advantages for POMs to prepare metal-based electrode materials.
(1) POMs can supply abundant transition metals (such as V, Mo, W, Nb, and Ta).
(2) POMs are beneficial for constructing porous architectures by releasing oxygen atoms in the clusters during the pyrolysis process, providing open channels for ions and electrons.
(3) The inherent heteroatoms (such as P, Si, Ge, Se, and Sb) of POMs can be doped into the electrode materials conveniently and further improve the electrochemical performances.
(4) The variability of metal valence in POM clusters is favorable for improving the redox properties of the electrode materials.
(5) Advantageous synergistic effects can be achieved through combining POMs with other matrices (such as MOFs, POPs, and carbon nanomaterials).
(6) POM precursors can be controllably modulated on an atomic/molecular scale, conducive to revealing the relationship between the structure and function.
Therefore, numerous researchers have devoted their effort to design electrode materials through employing various POM precursors, especially for rechargeable batteries, including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs), lithium–O2 batteries (LOBs), magnesium-ion batteries (MIBs), metal–air batteries (MABs), redox flow batteries (RFBs), and thermal batteries (Scheme 1). These enlightening studies have provided a series of new insights and deserve to be summarized and discussed, but there is currently no special review or summary on POM-derived materials for rechargeable batteries. This might be because the basic concept and categories of POMs are usually neglected, and these compounds used to be chosen as precursors mainly owing to their commercial availability and low cost as well as abundant metal source. In fact, the ambiguous employment of such precursors is not beneficial for the rational design of advanced electrode materials and the further exploration of their structure–function relationship. Hence, in this review, we systematically analyzed and outlined the relevant research studies focusing on the application of POM derivatives in rechargeable batteries for the first time, including their diverse syntheses, structures, and electrochemical performances. Remarks on the challenges and future prospects of such POM-derived materials are also discussed and proposed. This review aims to provide an outlook for researchers to explore POM-based functional materials towards rechargeable batteries, and pave new ways for further development of POM derivatives.

2. POM derivatives for lithium-ion batteries
Mo-, W-, and V-based MOs, MSs, MCs, MPs, MNs, etc. are promising electrode materials for LIBs because of their high theoretical capacity. When used as anode materials, these metal composites are reduced to the metallic state and Li+ ions insert into their architectures during the discharge process, and then the metals are reoxidized during the charging process, which can be simplified as reaction (1).143–145 MaXb + cLi+ + ce− → LicXb + aM (a, b, c > 0; X = O, S, C, P, and N)(1)
In this conversion reaction, the metal of MaXb is replaced by lithium and disperses in LicXb, which is much safer for batteries because it prevents the formation of lithium dendrites. However, such conversion mechanism also faces the problems of unexpected volume expansion, phase transformation and irreversible conversion, and the associated consequences of pulverization of electrode materials and rapid capacity fading.146–149 Similarly, the cathode materials of LIBs also face the problem of capacity fading owing to the phase change. Fortunately, recent studies reveal that the nanostructured Mo-, W-, and V-based materials originating from POM precursors show special benefits for suppressing capacity fading. On the one hand, POM clusters are rich in metal and oxygen resources, giving promising platforms to synthesize metal nanocomposites conveniently. On the other hand, the obtained electrode materials from POM precursors can produce porous architectures,150 not only alleviating the aggregation and volume expansion of pulverized nanocrystals efficiently, but also providing faster electronic routes for charge transfer. POMs can also be used to construct composites with other matrices (such as organic molecules, polymers or carbon nanomaterials) at the nanoscale level. This is an effective route to alleviate the common problems of metal-based electrode materials during cycling.151,152 Additionally, nanomaterials can provide a large specific surface area and ensure convenient contact between the electrode and electrolyte, efficiently shortening the transfer and diffusion paths of electrons and ions.153,154 After pyrolysis treatment, POM-derived metal composites can be controllably designed and synthesized as MOs, MSs, MCs, MPs, MNs, or their hybrid materials. These derivatives exhibit enhanced electrochemical performances in LIBs due to the inherent advantages of POM precursors. A summary of the electrochemical performances of POM derivatives as anode materials for LIBs is listed in Table 1.

2.1 MO anode materials
MOs are competitive anode materials for LIBs due to their high theoretical capacity and electronic properties.137,155–160,163,221 Heterogeneous charge transfer at the interfaces and the metal–oxygen bond cleavage are involved in the conversion reaction of MO-based electrode materials. Recent research studies show that MO-based electrode materials with nanostructures can alleviate the kinetic barriers of the conversion reaction, because the heterogeneous electron transfer as well as the Li+ diffusion can be enhanced, and the metal–oxygen bond strength of nanoscale MOs is much weaker than that in bulk MOs.222,223 POMs can be presented as the precursors to prepare such MOs, primarily because of their highly redox-active metals and abundant oxygen atoms, which can generate defects in the derived materials and further improve their electrochemical performances. Among POM-derived MOs, molybdenum oxides and their composites with other materials are frequently used as anode materials because of their improved performances in LIBs.224–226 Thus, by using pyrolysis or hydrothermal–solvothermal treatment of molybdenum-containing POM precursors, various molybdenum-based oxides and their composites with different morphologies (such as nanospheres, nanocubes, or nanowires) are explored as anode materials for LIBs.159,160,165,170
According to the strength of the metal–oxygen bond, the lithium-storage mechanism of molybdenum-based oxides can be generally attributed to two types: insertion reaction and conversion reaction. However, what's actually happening in Li+ cycling reactions is still controversial, and lithium-storage mechanisms may vary depending on the specific cases. To date, four lithium-storage mechanisms have been reported for MoO2-based electrode materials, including one-electron insertion (reaction (2)),227 coupled insertion–conversion reaction (reaction (3)),228 four-electron conversion (reaction (4)),229 and structural defect-induced Li+ storage (reaction (5)).230 In fact, the actual lithium cycling mechanisms are probably based on several of the above-mentioned mechanisms. MoO2 + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixMoO2, 0 < x < 1(2) MoO2 ↔ Li0.98MoO2 ↔ Mo + Li2O(3) MoO2 + 4Li+ + 4e− ↔ Mo + 2LixO(4) MoO2 + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixMoO2, 0 < x < 4(5)
As a typical isopolyoxometalate, Mo7O24 is widely used as the Mo source, because it is a commercially available product and possesses high water solubility, beneficial for subsequent processing (Fig. 1 shows the anion structure of Mo7O24). Moreover, nanometer-size and hierarchical structures are imported into MoO2-based electrode materials to achieve a large active interface and high stability. For example, the core–shell MoO2 with a shell thickness of 80–100 nm derived from Mo7O24 displays a preferable electrochemical performance compared to that of bulk MoO2 in LIBs.226 Xu et al. prepared another core–shell nanostructure of MoO2@MoS2, which was constructed from layered MoS2 nanosheets arranged on MoO2 particles.161 As an anode material for LIBs, such 3D MoO2@MoS2 architecture can alleviate the volume expansion of the electrode material during charge and discharge processes by virtue of the empty space between the nanosheet layers. Recently, a simple method was developed to construct hierarchical Mo-based polydopamine (PDA) hollow spheres.162 Owing to the hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups in the hybrid materials, different sphere architectures were self-assembled by adjusting the solvents and the ratio of reagents (Mo7O24/PDA). Later, a hollow MoO2/C structure was formed after heat-treatment of the Mo-based PDA precursor. As an anode material for LIBs, the hollow MoO2/C shows a long cycling performance and an improved rate capability. Additionally, using the Mo7O24–PDA precursor, Fang and co-workers prepared hierarchical carbon microflowers decorated with MoO2 nanoparticles. This microflower material possesses a large Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area (335 m2 g−1) and retains a capacity of 576.0 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 1000 mA g−1 in LIBs.163 By utilizing SiO2 nanospheres as the template, Sun et al. controllably synthesized a series of superstructures (such as nanospheres, nanocubes, nanorods, or hollow spheres) in the size range from 10 to 500 nm by heating and etching the Mo7O24–PDA precursor.164 The use of the template may contribute to the preparation of hollow materials with different micromorphologies and high BET specific surface area, which are helpful for the insertion and de-insertion of Li+.

POM-based MOFs (POMOFs) have drawn great research interest on account of their porous architectures, high specific surface area, and diverse compositions.231–233 The above-mentioned characteristics have led to the widespread use of POMOFs for preparing MOs. In recent years, Lan and co-workers have designed and synthesized a series of POMOFs and explored their applications in energy storage and conversion.234–238 Chen and co-workers used a POMOF (NENU-5) as the precursor to prepare a porous MoO2@C composite.165 In such preparation, MoO2 nanoparticles were homogeneously embedded in a porous carbon matrix through direct calcination (Fig. 2). During the thermal treatment process, Cu2+ in NENU-5 was reduced to Cu0 and the carbon skeleton was formed by carbonizing organic ligands. The final product, MoO2@C, was obtained by removal of metallic Cu0 through chemical etching using Fe3+. It is noted that MoO2@C well maintains the octahedral morphology of the precursor, and the surface of the octahedron becomes rough due to the release of gaseous molecules. When used as an anode material for LIBs, the generated MoO2@C delivers a reversible capacity of 1442 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 100 mA g−1 and 443.8 mA h g−1 after 850 cycles at 1000 mA g−1, respectively. Moreover, MoO2@C also exhibits excellent rate capability with a rate capacity of 543 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1. Such outstanding cycling and rate performances can be attributed to the unique nanostructure with a large BET specific surface area, high porosity, and numerous active sites. In view of this, the co-precursors of POMs and MOFs are ideal for preparing metal oxide/carbon composites owing to their intriguing structures and compositions.

Polymetallic oxides are an important group of MOs. As compared with unary metal oxides, binary or ternary metal oxides can bring about new structures and properties by combining the performance advantages of different metals. In addition, various candidate materials can be explored as electrode materials by changing the metal compositions and synthetic conditions. A composite of Zn2Mo3O8 and porous carbon was prepared by a molten salt strategy and ion exchange.166 The additional Zn can not only form the oxysalt but can also provide a soft template to create a porous carbon matrix. When used as an anode material for LIBs, the Zn2Mo3O8–C electrode delivers a high rate capacity of 753 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1 and exhibits long cycling stability. In 2017, Niu et al. synthesized a polymetallic Cu-based POMOF with PMo12 and PW12 guests.141 After pyrolysis of such precursor at 600 °C under a N2 flow, Mo0.8W0.2O2–Cu@P-doped carbon octahedra were obtained. As an anode material for LIBs, the Mo0.8W0.2O2–Cu@P-doped carbon octahedra deliver a long cycle life of 2000 cycles with a capacity loss of 0.043% per cycle. The remarkable cycling stability can be attributed to the synergistic effect of multicomponent active dopants. Additionally, Yoon et al. reported a microwave–hydrothermal strategy to prepare W0.4Mo0.6O3 and WOx–MoO2 nanorods by employing Na2WO4·2H2O as the W source and Mo7O24 as the Mo source.239 The advantage of the synergistic multi-doping effect is distinct, but how the second or third additional metal influences the electrochemical properties and what the key factor of the synergistic effect are two important questions that need to be answered in future research studies.
It is well known that nanocrystallization of an electrode material is a feasible way to improve the electrochemical performance, but the intensive side reactions, aggregation, and volume variation of active materials, and the consequent pulverization of the electrode usually lead to severe capacity fading and poor cycling stability. Some former studies have shown that the hybridization of MOs with a carbon-based matrix can effectively prevent the aggregation of MO particles and relieve the volume expansion–contraction of active materials, particularly upon hybridizing with conductive carbon substrates.162,164,165 However, conductive carbon substrates have been combined with MOs to increase the electronic conductivity and relieve the volume variation of active materials.133,168,169 As a classical 2D carbon material, graphene has been widely used as a conductive carbon substrate to anchor MO particles and then to stabilize the whole structure of the electrode material. Simultaneously, the incorporation of MO particles is also conducive to inhibiting the stacking of graphene sheets, which further contributes to electrochemical performance enhancement. A graphene-oxide-supported MoO2 composite was prepared by using Mo7O24 and graphene oxide (GO) sheets as the precursor, and MoO2/GO with layered or 3D honeycomb-like architectures could be controllably obtained via altering the content of GO.170 By altering the amount of GO in the Mo7O24/GO precursor, MoO2/GO with a layered or a 3D honeycomb-like architecture was controllably prepared. The inner structures of these hybrid materials have a strong influence on the Li storage performance and the MoO2/GO honeycomb composite delivers a discharge capacity of 1127.0 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1 in LIBs. Combining the advantages of carbon materials and POMOFs, Lin and co-workers reported a porous MoO2–Cu/C/graphene nanohybrid originating from a POMOF/GO precursor.171 When treated as an anode of LIBs, the MoO2–Cu/C/graphene material exhibits a discharge capacity of 1114.8 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles and a rate capacity of 702.2 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1. The synergistic effect between the POM-derived active materials and the conducting graphene support enables the electrode materials to achieve the desired electrochemical performances. For example, the reported MoO2/graphene, Mn2Mo3O8/graphene, and Fe2Mo3O8/reduced graphene oxide (Fe2Mo3O8/rGO) nanosheets all exhibit highly reversible capacity and excellent cycling ability in LIBs.172–174
Different kinds of POMs may have different effects on the electrochemical performances when they are used as precursors. Zhu and co-workers selected two kinds of POMs (PMo12 and Mo7O24) to synthesize free-standing carbon fibers with imbedded MoO2/Mo2C particles by the electrospinning technique and carbonization process.178 The products can be directly applied as electrodes without any current collector or binder. According to the electrochemical characterization, the electrode material originating from the PMo12 precursor displays a more excellent electrochemical performance as compared with the sample originating from the Mo7O24 precursor. When applied as an anode for LIBs, the PMo12-derived electrode material delivers a capacity of 1098.2 mA h g−1 after 70 cycles at 100 mA g−1, while the Mo7O24-derived electrode material delivers a capacity of 735.3 mA h g−1. Cyclic voltammetry tests also show that the former possesses a higher reversibility of Li+ insertion and de-insertion than the latter sample. Moreover, when two kinds of POMs are simultaneously employed as precursors, metal-doped MOs can be designed and synthesized conveniently. For example, highly ordered mesoporous W-doped MoO2 and Mo-doped WO2 electrode materials were obtained by simultaneously using PMo12 and PW12 as precursors, respectively.179,180 For W-doped MoO2, tungsten-doping can facilitate the reaction of MoO2 with Li+, and avoid the long “activation process” of MoO2 during Li+ insertion–extraction cycles. This is probably because the LixMoO2/W nanocomposite is formed upon continuous lithiation of the active material (Fig. 3). The generated metallic tungsten offers a conductive network for the whole electrode material. Moreover, metallic tungsten can also promote the decomposition of LiMoO2 to Mo and Li2O. As a result, the electrode kinetics and Li storage performance are enhanced effectively. These studies provide an important direction towards new anode materials regarding the choice of POM precursors.

2.2 MS anode materials
MSs, especially layered transition metal dichalcogenides, have intriguing architectures owing to the van der Waals interaction between S–M–S layers, similar to the structure of graphite.240–248 Such architectures possess semiconducting properties with a large band gap and interlayer spacing, which is conducive to Li+ intercalation–extraction.183–189 The above unique feature provides the possibility for MSs to achieve superior electrochemical performance in LIBs. As an example, when used as an anode material for LIBs, MoS2 generally involves a four-electron transfer mechanism for the full conversion reaction (reaction (6)), and the theoretical specific capacity of MoS2 is 669 mA h g−1.249,250 MoS2 + 4Li+ + 4e− ↔ 2Li2S + Mo(6)
Recent reports indicate that the structures of MSs have an important impact on their electrochemical performances, and hierarchical nanostructures are beneficial for high-performance electrode materials because of the increased contact area between the electrolytes and electrode materials.251–254 As a consequence, a variety of MS nanostructures and MS nanocomposites with different morphologies are explored as anode materials for LIBs. In this case, POMs, especially Mo7O24, are usually selected as suitable precursors to prepare such hierarchical MSs owing to their abundant metal atoms and high solubility. Therefore, POM-derived MS microspheres, nanosheets, flowers or bubbles, and their composites with various matrices (such as graphene, CNTs, conductive polymers, and MXenes) are conveniently prepared via different kinds of methods (such as the hydrothermal method, vapor phase sulfurization, and electrochemical synthesis).136,194,202
MoS2 prepared via the hydrothermal method usually appears as flower-like spheres or layered nanosheets. Huang and co-workers developed a facile process to hydrothermally synthesize MoS2 by employing thiourea and Mo7O24 as starting materials.140 Interestingly, the morphologies of MoS2 can be adjusted via addition of NaOH from porous flowers (1 mol L−1 NaOH) to dense spheres (3 mol L−1 NaOH), providing a subtle clue for rational design of MoS2. This work also confirms that the flower-like MoS2 electrode material delivers a more excellent electrochemical performance than MoS2 spheres owing to the porous feature of the former sample. When such MoS2 microspheres grew on graphene nanosheets (GNSs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), an ultralong cyclability (728 mA h g−1 at 5000 mA g−1 after 1000 cycles) was obtained for MoS2–GNSs–CNTs.195 The incorporation of the graphene backbone and CNTs yields a highly conductive 3D network for MoS2, and CNTs can effectively prevent the stacking of GNSs, providing a large contact area for the electrode material and electrolyte, which is beneficial for fast Li+ and electron transportation. When graphene was used as the carbon substrate, MoS2 nanosheets could grow perpendicularly on the graphene surface.201 This can efficiently prevent the agglomeration of MoS2 nanosheets and the stacking of graphene sheets. In addition, such metal dichalcogenides with expanded interlayer spacing can be achieved by vertically edging MoS2 nanosheets on the graphene surface using Mo7O24 and GO as precursors under solvothermal conditions, and a large interlayer distance (9.8 Å) is helpful for the electrolyte and Li+ diffusion (Fig. 4).202 Moreover, the special structure of MoS2 nanosheets vertically anchored at the graphene surface enables a high structural stability and high-efficiency electron transfer by virtue of the strong bond strength between MoS2 nanosheets and graphene. As a consequence, taking advantage of multiple synergistic effects of high conductivity, stability, and a large interlayer distance, this composite exhibits an excellent rate performance with a rate capacity of 666 mA h g−1 at 3500 mA g−1 when used as an anode material for LIBs.

Under hydrothermal conditions, conductive polymers have also been explored as a matrix for the MS system to improve the conductivity of the whole hybrid system. The hybrid material of polyaniline (PANI) and MoS2 shows an enhanced electrochemical performance, mainly benefiting from the high conductivity and short diffusion paths of Li+.255 Hierarchical MoS2/PANI nanowires were prepared by in situ polymerization and a subsequent hydrothermal process with anilinium trimolybdate as the precursor (Mo3O10(C6H5NH3)2·2H2O, ATM). The large voids in this hierarchical architecture effectively alleviate the volume change of the active material during the charge/discharge process and greatly improve the cycling performance. The composition of this hybrid material can be conveniently adjusted by changing the dosage of Mo7O24 during polymerization, and the material with an optimal composition (the ratio of Mo7O24 to ATM is 0.43) retains a reversible capacity of 952.6 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 100 mA g−1 in LIBs.
As a new family of 2D materials, MXenes are promising matrix materials for energy storage applications because of their metallic conductivity, high density, and rich surface chemistry. In this case, a hierarchical MoS2/Ti3C2–MXene@C nanocomposite was prepared through a convenient nanoplating approach, providing a new electrochemical material for LIBs.196 The nanocomposite exhibits a BET specific surface area of 116 m2 g−1, and delivers a remarkable cycling stability and a pretty slow capacity loss (about 0.0016% per cycle) during an ultra-long cycle life of 3000 cycles at a very high rate of 20000 mA g−1. The outstanding performance can be attributed to the substantial structural merits for suppression of structural degradation. Similarly, a sandwich-like 3D conductive architecture via growing MoS2 nanosheets on a Ti3C2 matrix was reported by Guo and co-workers.197 Such composite exhibits a maximum capacity of 656.0 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 in LIBs, which is two times as high as the theoretical capacity of Ti3C2.
Multilayered MoS2 crystals can be prepared through a chelation-assisted sol–gel method (Fig. 5).198 Mo7O24 provides the molybdenum source and thioacetamide provides the sulfur source. Firstly, the terminal O atoms of Mo7O24 were substituted by S2− ions generated from thioacetamide. In the following process, diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid was added as the chelating agent to promote the formation of monolithic gel. In this case, a stable electron structure was formed with the cleavage of some Mo–S bonds and the chelation between the chelating agent and Mo atoms. Finally, a complicated network structure was gradually generated, and then the complex gel was obtained. After calcination at 1000 °C, the formed MoS2 layers stacked together to construct MoS2 flakes, and the flakes further aggregated to form crystalline MoS2 nanoparticles. However, the cycling performance of this material in LIBs is unsatisfactory, and the specific capacity rapidly falls below 300 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1. Recently, this research group modified the synthetic scheme to prepare a porous MoS2/C nanocomposite by a template-assisted sol–gel process.199 Mo7O24 and tetramethyloxysilane were selected as the Mo precursor and gelation accelerator. As compared to their previous work, the obtained porous MoS2/C nanocomposite shows an increased specific capacity and improved cycling performance.

High-temperature pyrolysis in an inert gas atmosphere has also been widely reported for preparing MS-based materials. In 2017, Li and co-workers prepared a N and P co-doped MoS2@C composite using typical Keggin-type PMo12 and N,S-containing ligands (dithiooxamide or L-cysteine) as precursors through simultaneous self-sulfuration and self-carbonization processes.203 After carbonization, MoS2 bubbles were conformally encapsulated by thin carbon layers and extended to a broader N and P co-doped carbon network substrate seamlessly. Kang and co-workers reported a new method to synthesize WS2–C composite microspheres by pyrolyzing the solution spray of (NH4)6H2W12O40 (denoted as W12O40 and the anion structure is shown in Fig. 1).200 However, the BET specific surface area of the composite is as low as 4 m2 g−1 and the size distribution of the derived nanoparticles is not uniform. As a consequence, the capacity retention was only 78% after the first cycle.
2.3 MC anode materials
MCs possess integrated advantages of transition metals and ionic crystals, and thus MCs are proved to be one kind of promising anode candidate for LIBs because of their high electronic conductivity.256 MCs can be structurally divided into three categories, MC, M2C, and M3C, respectively. MC generally crystallizes in the cubic strucure, while complex atomic arrangements of orthorhombic and hexagonal structures are usually observed in M2C and M3C. To obtain MCs, high-temperature carbonization is the most commonly employed method. In general, metal-based particles are inclined to agglomerate to large particles during a high-temperature treatment process. To control the size and morphology of the final products, the metal and carbon reactants need to be specially designed. As previously discussed, POMs are beneficial for constructing porous architectures when used as precursors, especially through the carbonization of POM and carbon matrix precursors.
For example, Zhu and co-workers reported mesoporous Mo2C/N-doped carbon heteronanowires through the calcination of ATM.206 Molybdate ions were entirely transferred to Mo2C when the carbonization temperature rose to 775 °C, and Mo2C particles were uniformly embedded in the N-doped carbon matrix. This composite with a continuous 1D structure shows a reversible capacity of 732.9 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1 after 700 cycles when used as an anode material for LIBs.
As compared with 1D and 2D structures, 3D composites have a large electrical contact area and possess a big advantage in ion delivery. As reported, MoC nanoparticles were anchored in a 3D N-doped porous carbon matrix via pyrolysis of Mo7O24, micyanodiamide, and PDA precursors.208 After a two-step annealing treatment process, MoC nanoparticles of 2–3 nm diameter were filled into the porous carbon matrix and dispersed in the pores, exhibiting a large BET surface area of 496 m2 g−1. When the as-prepared composite was used as an anode for LIBs, it exhibited excellent reversible capacities of 813.0 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 1000 mA g−1 and 1246.0 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 100 mA g−1, respectively, profiting from the increased conductivity and improved electrolyte penetration. Such electrode material also delivers a high rate capacity of 509.0 mA h g−1 at 5000 mA g−1, and a capacity of 965.0 mA h g−1 can be retained when the current density is brought back to 100 mA g−1. Moreover, multicomponent MoO2–Mo2C–C microspheres can be synthesized via pyrolyzing Mo7O24 and PDA in an inert atmosphere.211 In the high-temperature annealing process, PDA transformed to carbon and Mo7O24 decomposed into MoO2, and then MoO2 reacted with carbon to form Mo2C. When used as an anode material for LIBs, this multicomponent composite shows outstanding cycling stability and rate capability, delivering a reversible capacity of 1188 mA h g−1 after 250 cycles at 100 mA g−1.
The template method is a good strategy to prepare 3D porous materials. NaCl is a user-friendly template, because it is abundant, cheap, and water-soluble. More importantly, NaCl can be easily eliminated with water. Cao and co-workers provided a new vision to construct hierarchical 3D porous Mo2C (3DHP-Mo2C) by a scalable NaCl template method using Mo7O24 and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as precursors (Fig. 6).210 The resultant macro–meso–microporous structure material exhibits a large BET specific surface area (217 m2 g−1). The well-defined porous structure can offer more accessible active sites and improve the electron transfer and ion diffusion, which contribute to reducing the relevant transfer resistance. As a result, when used as an anode material for LIBs, 3DHP-Mo2C exhibits high discharge capacities of 927.4 and 654.3 mA h g−1 at 100 and 300 mA g−1 after 100 cycles, respectively. Most importantly, a reversible capacity of 481.4 mA h g−1 and a coulombic efficiency of more than 98.0% can be retained after 600 cycles at 1000 mA g−1, implying long-term cycling stability. In addition, the macroporous structure of 3DHP-Mo2C is well-retained after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1, demonstrating the good structural stability of 3DHP-Mo2C. The superior Li storage performance of 3DHP-Mo2C can be attributed to the 3D open structure and special macro–meso–microporous architecture, which provide more active sites and channels for ion and electron transport. The hierarchically 3D porous architecture is also beneficial for alleviating the volume change and maintaining the structural integrity of the electrode material.

2.4 Other anode materials
POM-derived metals, metal phosphides, metal selenides, etc. have also been reported as electrode materials for LIBs. For example, Mo was used as an inactive matrix to enhance the initial coulombic efficiency of Sn. A Sn/Mo powder mixture was obtained by chemical precipitation and solid state reduction of Mo7O24 and Sn(OH)4 in a H2 atmosphere.257 Such method is conducive to obtaining Sn particles with smaller size and maintaining the uniform distribution of Sn in the Mo matrix. After addition of Mo, the effect of volume change is greatly decreased and the structural integrity can be further retained. Thus, when utilized as an anode material for LIBs, the Sn/Mo mixture exhibits a better electrochemical performance than Sn, but the cycle life still needs to be enhanced.
MPs have shown attractive electrochemical properties in LIBs due to their high capacity. However, the practical application of MPs is mainly hindered by volume expansion and irreversible conversion reaction.256 To address these challenges, combining MPs with carbon materials is explored, since this can enhance electronic conductivity and alleviate volume variation, and thus improve Li storage performance.258 Cao and co-workers reported the first 3D porous MoP@C by carbonizing Mo7O24 and (NH4)2HPO4. When the obtained MoP@C was applied as an anode material for LIBs, it delivered a reversible capacity of 1028 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles.213
Transition metal selenides have also been considered as a kind of alternative anode material for LIBs because of their much larger interlamellar space.214,216,217,259 Jin et al. reported a CNTs@C@MoSe2@Se hybrid material with an amorphous structure prepared by a simple solvothermal treatment. This hybrid material can effectively prohibit the aggregation and buffer the volume variation of the active material during cycling in LIBs.218 A novel N-doped carbon@MoSe2 core–branch nanostructure was constructed by Wang and co-workers. Such material exhibits a stable capacity of 906.0 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1 when used as an anode material for LIBs.219 Hollow MoSe2 spheres encapsulated by carbon were synthesized by using a SiO2 template.138 When this hollow material was applied as an anode for LIBs, it showed a reversible capacity of 744.0 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 after 300 cycles and a remarkable rate capacity of 370.0 mA h g−1 even at 10000 mA g−1. Zhang and co-workers developed an effective approach to prepare a 2D layered mesoporous composite of MoS2(1−x)Se2x and graphene. The obtained mesoporous composite can retain a capacity of 830.0 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles at 100 mA g−1.220 It should be mentioned that the existence of Se in this system enlarges the interplanar spacing of the 002 plane and alleviates the volume change during cycling by providing more transport channels for both electrons and ions, leading to improved electrochemical performance.
2.5 POM-derived cathode materials
The cathode materials of LIBs are usually lithium-based metal salts, and their structures have a high requirement to facilitate electron and lithium ion transfer. This goal can be conveniently achieved by employing POMs as metal precursors.260–270 These derivatives can generally be divided into three categories:271–279
(1) Mo6+ or V5+ from POM precursors is incorporated into olivine structure or layered oxide cathode materials (such as LiFePO4 or xLi2MnO3·(1–x)LiMO2 (M = Ni, Co, or Mn)) to partially substitute transition metal (such as Fe, Ni, Co or Mn) sites, and thus the obtained Mo/V-doped cathode materials allow long-term cycling performance and better rate performance.261,262,265–267,270,276 On the one hand, this is probably because Mo/V with high charge valence possesses stronger hybridization with oxygen ions than Ni/Mn (related to oxygen gas evolution) and thus increases the structural stabilization. On the other hand, doping alien cations may reduce the polarization of layered oxide cathode materials by decreasing cell resistance and enhancing conductivity, which is helpful for improving the rate capability. For example, a lithium vanadate material (LixMg(1−x)V(2−x)MoxO6) prepared by Shenouda et al. delivers a high capacity of 265 mA h g−1.271 Park et al. reported a cathode material, Li[Li0.167Ni0.233Co0.100Mn0.467Mo0.033]O2, and conducted surface modifications with Al2O3 and AlPO4 to alleviate the critical problems associated with battery stability and safety.274 The structure of cathode materials is critical to the analysis and understanding of their electrochemical properties and reaction mechanism. The detailed structure of layered molybdenum–zirconium oxide was determined by Ueda and co-workers through high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM).278 As shown in Fig. 7, the layer distance is 7.84 Å in the b–c plane, and the arrangement of metal ions adopts two types of sites in the molecular layer, containing two Mo sites and one central Zr site. When this layered oxide was used as a cathode material for LIBs, with reduction and oxidation of Mo and Zr ions, Li+ could reversibly migrate between molecular layers without destroying the layered structure, and thus a stable cycling performance was obtained.

(2) The second category is coating the surface of cathode materials with POM derivatives as the third phase. After modification, the electrochemical kinetics is greatly improved owing to the decreased surface resistance and polarization of cathode materials, and therefore the electrochemical performance is significantly enhanced.273,275,279 For example, a slightly improved electrochemical performance is achieved by modifying the traditional cathode material LiFePO4/C with POM-derived WO2, probably because the surface resistance decreases and the electronic conductivity increases.279
(3) Owing to the varied oxidation states and multi-electron transfer properties of Mo/V, molybdenum/vanadium oxides, molybdenum polysulfides, molybdenum doped vanadium oxides, lithium molybdenum/vanadium oxides, molybdenum-based phosphates, etc. from POM precursors have served as cathode materials directly for LIBs.260,271,277 Liu and co-workers prepared α-MoO3 nanowire bundles from a POM-based inorganic–organic precursor, and the morphology of α-MoO3 can be controlled by prolonging the carbonization time.268 As a cathode for LIBs, such electrode material exhibited a discharge capacity of 195 mA h g−1 and retained 37% capacity after 600 cycles at 100 mA g−1. The poor cycling stability may be caused by the lower discharge potential plateau (<2.4 V), which enlarges the interlayer spacing of the oxide structure by excessive lithium insertion, further resulting in an irreversible structural change and kinetics barrier for Li+ extraction.
3. POM-derived materials for sodium-ion batteries
The working mechanism of SIBs is similar to that of LIBs, involving the uptake and release of the electrolyte ion (Na+) between positive and negative electrodes.280,281 As compared with LIBs, SIBs have the following advantages: (1) sodium has abundant reserves and is cheap, which could reduce the cost by half as compared with LIBs; (2) at an equal concentration of electrolyte, the ionic conductivity of SIB electrolyte is about 20% higher than that of LIB electrolyte, so SIBs are allowed to work under low-concentration electrolyte; (3) since there are no overdischarged characteristics, SIBs can be discharged to zero volts and the energy density is usually greater than 100 W h kg−1. However, the sluggish electrochemical kinetics makes the electrochemical performance of SIBs worse than that of LIBs, caused by the large radius of Na+. Therefore, great effort has been made to explore appropriate electrode materials to accommodate the insertion and extraction of Na+. Because of the similarity of the working mechanism, materials with good Li storage performance can be applied as electrode materials for SIBs, such as intercalation-type (graphitic carbon, hard carbon, etc.), alloy-type (Sn, SnO2, etc.), and conversion-type (Fe2O3, CuO, etc.) anode materials. Among these most used anode materials, the reversible capacity of carbon materials is low. In contrast, metal-based anode materials have displayed high specific capacity during the initial charging and discharging process, but the rapid capacity fading caused by sluggish kinetics and volume expansion–contraction needs to be overcome urgently. As a typical layered material, transition-metal dichalcogenides possess a similar structure to graphite, but the interlayer space (0.69 nm) of transition-metal dichalcogenides is larger than that of graphite. The relatively large interlayer space and negatively charged S2− ions are conducive to intercalating Na+.282,283 Thus, a large class of transition-metal dichalcogenides is intensively explored as the anode materials for SIBs. Therefore, POM-derived transition-metal dichalcogenides (e.g., MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and their composites with various matrices) are also investigated as anode materials for SIBs, and these anode materials have shown the advantages of high specific capacity and good cycling stability.284–290 The electrochemical reaction of transition-metal dichalcogenides with Na+ generally contains two processes, intercalation and conversion. Taking MoS2 as an example, theoretically, the reaction of Na+ and MoS2 can be described as follows (reaction (7) and (8)).44 MoS2 + xNa+ + xe− → NaxMoS2 (above 0.4 V, x < 2)(7) NaxMoS2 + (4 − x) Na+ + (4 − x) e− → 2Na2S + Mo (below 0.4 V)(8)
At this point, Na+ exists in the interlayer spaces of MoS2 upon intercalation, and therefore a few-layer structure may be beneficial for the adsorption of Na+. In addition, the Na storage performances of POM-derived MoO2, Mo2C, and MoP are evaluated as well,291–295 and the detailed developments will be discussed in this section.
A 2D@2D composite of MS2 (M = Mo or W) and N-doped carbon layers with a lamellar architecture was prepared by a one-step hybridization strategy using Mo7O24 or W12O40 as the precursor.291 The arrayed MS2 with an ordered structure could accommodate internal resistance and improve the diffusion kinetics of the active components. In addition, the open space of the composite effectively alleviates the structural strain upon Na+ insertion/extraction. The intimate chemical coupling of active units and carbon layers contributes enormously to the electrochemical reaction, so both hybrid materials exhibit excellent cycling performance in SIBs. When evaluated as an anode material for SIBs, MoS2/C delivers a reversible capacity of 184 mA h g−1 and WS2/C delivers a capacity of 180 mA h g−1 after 1200 cycles at 1000 mA g−1, respectively. Chen and co-workers found that the interlayers of WS2 nanowires were gradually exfoliated and expanded during long-term cycling.284 Such process can provide more open channels for the intercalation of Na+ and facilitate ion diffusion and electron transfer. The expanded interlayer of the obtained products is greatly favorable for improving the sodium storage capability.
Wang and co-workers firstly reported an amorphous MoS2/MoO3/N-doped carbon composite for SIBs.204 Mo3O10(C2H10N2) nanowires were first synthesized by reacting Mo7O24 with ethylenediamine, and then the as-synthesized nanowires were partially sulfurized at 300 °C to obtain a MoS2/MoO3/N-doped carbon composite (Fig. 8). Interestingly, the morphology of the MoS2/MoO3/N-doped carbon composite is not influenced by the sulfuration, and the wire-like morphology is well-inherited. As an anode material of SIBs, the MoS2/MoO3/N-doped carbon composite retains a specific capacity of 538.7 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 300 mA g−1. Using the same precursor, Qian and co-workers designed hollow MoS2@C nanotubes via a facile hydrothermal sulfuration of Mo3O10(C2H10N2) nanowires.205 The sulfuration process can be interpreted as the anion-exchange reaction of S2− and O2− anions.296 O2− anions from Mo3O10(C2H10N2) diffuse outward to react with hydrogen cations to generate H2O, and S2− anions from L-cysteine react with Mo3O10(C2H10N2) to form MoS3, which is rapidly reduced to MoS2 on the surface of the Mo3O10(C2H10N2) nanowires. According to the Kirkendall effect, a hollow structure was gradually formed with the continuous consumption of internal Mo3O10(C2H10N2). As expected, the obtained hollow MoS2@C nanotubes exhibit enhanced electrochemical performance in SIBs. When applied as an anode material for SIBs, MoS2@C nanotubes retain a capacity of 512 mA h g−1 (initial capacity of 640 mA h g−1) after 200 cycles at 250 mA g−1. This composite also shows an excellent rate capacity, delivering a specific capacity of 370 mA h g−1 even at 2500 mA g−1.

The advantages of combining conductive carbonaceous materials with metal-based active materials are obvious both in improving the electronic conductivity and stabilizing the electrode structure during cycling processes. For example, Wei and co-workers utilized Mo3O10(C2H10N2) as a precursor to prepare a hierarchical MoS2@rGO hybrid material by perpendicularly anchoring MoS2 nanosheets on both sides of rGO.282 The flexibility, superior electronic conductivity, and large surface area of rGO are well-inherited in the obtained hybrid material. Therefore, the electrode material shows a BET specific surface area of 88 m2 g−1 and delivers a reversible capacity of 420.0 mA h g−1 after 160 cycles at 100 mA g−1.
MCs are also explored as electrode materials for SIBs. Ji and co-workers encapsulated Mo2C nanoparticles into a porous N-doped carbon matrix, and further evaluated the electrochemical performance of the obtained hybrid material.292 The electrochemical result clearly indicates that downsizing electrode materials to the nanoscale is effective at achieving improved electrochemical performance in contrast to their bulk counterparts. Nanomaterials possess shorter diffusion pathways for ion and electron transfer, and active composites on the nanoscale are able to alleviate the strain and accommodate the volume expansion during cycling. As expected, the as-prepared electrode material consisting of Mo2C nanoparticles and a N-doped carbon matrix exhibits improved cycling stability with a reversible capacity of 98.2 mA h g−1 after 2500 cycles at 1600 mA g−1. In addition, Zhu and co-workers extended their previous work175,206 to the application in SIBs using the same ATM precursor.293 The obtained hierarchical Mo2C/N-doped carbon nanowires are composed of Mo2C nanocrystals uniformly dispersed in a N-doped carbon matrix. When used as an anode of SIBs, the electrode material maintains a reversible capacity of 166 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 200 mA g−1, while commercial Mo2C microparticles only deliver a capacity of 60 mA h g−1. Qiu et al. prepared hollow MoCxNy microspheres after calcination of a supramolecular framework precursor, which was assembled from a PMo12 guest and the coordinating melamine and Cu2+ (Fig. 9).294 SEM studies distinctly indicate the hollow hierarchical microsphere morphology of MoCxNy. This kind of hollow structure provides a larger contact area for the electrode and electrolyte, allowing increased kinetics for ion and electron transport. The carbon nitride matrix further helps strengthen the conductivity of the whole hybrid material. On the other hand, the coordination geometry can hinder the aggregation of nanoparticles and guarantee their dispersal uniformity during the carbonization process, also proving profitable for alleviating the volume change during cycling processes. In this case, when applied as an anode material for SIBs, the as-prepared MoCxNy microspheres (obtained at 500 °C) exhibit a remarkable specific capacity of 410 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 160 mA g−1 and a rate capacity of 190 mA h g−1 at 830 mA g−1.

(d) Cycling performances at 160 mA g−1 and (e) rate performances of the hollow MoCxNy microspheres at different treatment temperatures (PM-500, -600, and -700 represent the precursor annealed at 500, 600, and 700 °C, respectively).

The superiority of MoSe2 is apparent when it is used as an anode material for LIBs and this has been discussed in the LIB section.138,219,220 Recently, Yue and co-workers utilized an electrospinning fiber technique to construct MoSe2@C nanofibers with embedded GNSs for SIBs.285 Nyquist plots indicate that the kinetics of the electrochemical reaction is greatly boosted by GNSs. Thus, such electrode material exhibits a reversible capacity of 366.9 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 200 mA g−1. It should be mentioned that the as-prepared nanofibers maintain their original morphology after long-term cycling. In addition, Fan and co-workers reported a 2D MoSe2/N–C nanosphere hybrid material using Mo7O24 and dopamine as precursors.286 When tested as an anode of SIBs, this electrode material exhibits outstanding cycling stability and delivers a capacity of 501.1 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 500 mA g−1. Meaningfully, this synthetic method can be easily extended to other functional metal composites. Shi et al. reported Mo(Se0.85S0.15)2/C nanotubes, which were derived from the mixed precursor of Mo7O24, S and Se powders.287 When evaluated as an anode material for SIBs, Mo(Se0.85S0.15)2/C maintains a discharge capacity of 421 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 200 mA g−1, close to the theoretical capacity of bulk MoSe2 (422 mA h g−1).
To compare the electrochemical performances of different derivatives, Guo and co-workers developed a universal strategy to construct composites of carbon nanosheets and MoX (X = C, O, P, or S) nanocrystals for SIBs.295 Mo7O24 and dopamine were selected as starting materials to obtain Mo–PDA inorganic–organic precursors by polymerization. Subsequently, the Mo–PDA precursors were treated by phosphorization, sulfuration, or carbonization to obtain the hierarchically hollow nanosphere composites of highly dispersed MoP, ultrathin MoS2, ultrasmall Mo2C, or MoO2 nanocrystals with carbon nanosheets, respectively. Mo7O24 as a precursor effectively hinders the aggregation of MoX nanocrystals. Such synthetic approach also provides close coupling interaction between the nanocrystals and carbon nanosheets. Benefiting from the strong interaction of such two components, the composites with hierarchical nanostructures show superior electrochemical performances. Especially, when the composite of MoS2 nanocrystals and carbon nanosheets was tested as an anode of SIBs, such MoS2/C electrode material shows a specific capacity of 410.0 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 4000 mA g−1. More importantly, the performance of the obtained MoS2-based electrode is one of the best in SIBs and the synthetic strategy can be extended to prepare other metal composites.
4. POM derivatives for other batteries
4.1 Lithium–sulfur batteries
As compared to conventional LIBs, LSBs exhibit much higher energy density and are becoming one of the most promising candidates for energy storage devices.297,298 Additionally, the advantages of sulfur such as low cost and low toxicity further facilitate the development of LSBs. The cathode materials of LSBs are elemental sulfur or sulfur-based composites (such as sulfur/carbon or sulfur/metal composites), while the anode material is lithium foil in general. Hence, the electrochemical reaction of LSBs theoretically involves anode and cathode reactions (9) and (10). 2Li ↔ 2Li+ + 2e−(9) S8 + 16Li+ + 16e− ↔ 8Li2S(10)
Such process gives a high theoretical specific capacity of 1672 mA h g−1.299 In an ideal discharge process, lithium metal loses an electron and is oxidized to Li+, and then the electron and Li+ move to the cathode through the external circuit and electrolyte to react with S8, respectively.300 S8 with a circular structure is subsequently reduced and conducts ring cleavage reaction, which results in the generation of various intermediate polysulfides with different chain lengths (Li2Sx, 2 < x ≤ 8) and a final product of Li2S with continuous discharge. The charging process is just the opposite.
The reaction mechanism of LSBs seems simple, but the actual process is a solid–liquid–solid transformation process, which involves the dissolution of long-chain lithium polysulfides and the precipitation of short-chain sulfides, and the resulting problems of fast capacity fading, high self-discharge rate, and low utilization of the active material.301,302 Much effort has been devoted to solving the above issues, showing that polar transition metal composites combined with conductive carbon are promising. Among these transition metal composites, POM-derived metal composites have drawn much attention due to their structural stability.303–305
According to the strong interaction between lithium polysulfides and metal or heteroatom dopants, Ng and co-workers used W12O42 or Mo7O24 as a precursor to synthesize WN or Mo2N material.303 When WN and Mo2N were used as the sulfur hosts, the composite cathodes exhibited capacities of 697.0 and 569.0 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 167.5 mA g−1 with 8 mg cm−2 loading, respectively. Li and co-workers prepared the WxC host by using a POMOF as a precursor.304 After infiltrating sulfur, the derived electrode material displays a higher (>97%) coulombic efficiency for over 1000 cycles. MoO2 was also applied to alleviate poor redox kinetics and the shuttle effect. Sun and co-workers developed a sulfur host (MoO2/rGO) of hollow MoO2 spheres anchored on N-doped rGO.142 As shown in Fig. 10, MoO2 spheres (about 500 nm) are evenly distributed on rGO sheets and the interior space of the hollow MoO2 sphere is fully occupied after sulfur immersion. Such hollow host with a conductive network can enable a high sulfur loading and afford both physical and chemical confinement for lithium polysulfides. When used as a cathode material for LSBs, the MoO2/rGO–S composite displays a long-term cycling performance with a capacity of 664 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 1675 mA g−1. The excellent performance can be attributed to the benefits of the hollow structure and uniform rGO coating, which offer both chemical adsorption and physical confinement for polysulfides and a conductive network for the active material. Furthermore, the interaction of the C–O–Mo bond between rGO and MoO2 provides a stable pathway for electron transfer. Owing to the above advantages, the electrochemical kinetics is efficiently enhanced.

(e) Illustration of charge transfer in the MoO2/rGO–S composite host. Reproduced from ref. 142 with permission from The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Although the above POM derivatives exhibit a positive effect on suppressing the dissolution of lithium polysulfides, as with other transition metal composites, the derivatives still need to combine with carbon materials to increase conductivity. In the further design, POM derivatives for LSBs should possess large pore volume to load high content of sulfur, good conductivity to increase the utilization of sulfur, and strong adsorbability to anchor lithium polysulfides. Additionally, the low usage of additional conductive carbon and binder is also important for the design of electrode materials.
4.2 Lithium–O2 batteries
LOBs have aroused concern because of their high theoretical energy density, which is much higher than that of LIBs.306 The ideal reaction process of LOBs can be described as reaction (11). 2Li + O2 ↔ Li2O2(11)
Thus, the reaction mechanism of LOBs is based on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the cathode during the discharging and charging process.307 However, the low activity and stability of the cathode greatly hinder the development of LOBs. In recent years, POM derived metal composites have shown excellent electrocatalytic properties in the HER, OER, and ORR.308–310 Hence, these electrocatalysts may also be promising cathode materials for LOBs.
Cui and co-workers designed and synthesized a mesoporous bimetallic nitride, Co3Mo3N, derived from Mo7O24 and cobalt nitrate. The as-prepared Co3Mo3N exhibits excellent cycling performance and a lower anodic overpotential when employed as a cathode for LOBs.311 Such material also possesses intriguing bifunctional electrocatalytic capability for both the ORR and OER. Considering the necessity for a high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalyst, an optimal porous structure is also significant for developing high-performance LOBs. For example, Fong and co-workers presented an electrode material that consisted of N-doped carbon foam decorated with MoO2/Mo2C heterostructured nanocrystals.312 The hierarchically porous 3D carbon foam can not only ensure improved cyclability and rate performance in LOBs, but can also enhance the electrocatalytic activity in both the OER and ORR with a promising round-trip efficiency of 89.1% at a current density of 100 mA g−1. A comparative study was further conducted using the Mo7O24 precursor and a simple metal-salt ((NH4)2MoO4) precursor, and the obtained result fully demonstrated the benefits of the POM cluster precursor in terms of electrochemical performance. Liu and co-workers reported a binder-free cathode material (Mo2C@CC) composed of Mo2C nanoparticles grown on carbon cloth (Fig. 11).313
 Fig. 11  (a) Synthetic scheme of the binder-free Mo2C nanoparticles grown on carbon cloth and the discharge/charge mechanism of such electrode in LOBs. (b) Cycling performances of carbon cloth (CC), Mo2C, and Mo2C@CC at 500 mA g−1 with a cut-off capacity of 500 mA h g−1. (c) Corresponding overpotentials of the Mo2C@CC electrode (vs. Li/Li+). Reproduced from ref. 313 with permission from The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Firstly, carbon cloth was immersed in a solution of Mo7O24, citric acid and polyvinyl pyrrolidone. Then, the infiltrated carbon cloth was dried at 130 °C. During the drying process, Mo7O24 was converted to MoO3 that coated the surface of carbon cloth. During the following annealing process, MoO3 reacted with the carbon fibers of carbon cloth and formed pores and Mo2C nanoparticles by releasing carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide. The in situ generated Mo2C was then incorporated into these pores. The unique porous structure of such hybrid material dramatically enhances the cycling stability, rate capability, and specific capacity by avoiding the exfoliation and aggregation of the electrode material during extensive charge/discharge cycles. The large pores also allow fast O2 diffusion and Li+ transport and accommodate more insoluble discharge products. Hence, when applied as an electrode material for LOBs, Mo2C@CC exhibits a stable cycling performance for 700 h at 500 mA g−1 with a cut-off capacity of 500 mA h g−1. At this cut-off capacity, the overpotential is increased by 7.0% after 120 charge/discharge cycles.
As discussed above, efficient bifunctional catalysts for the ORR and OER may be highly desirable electrode materials for LOBs. However, the practical operation mechanism of LOBs is more complicated, involving multiple reaction pathways and various additional chemical reactions. A fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism and cathode structure is of utmost importance for the development of high-performance LOB electrodes. According to the available literature, bifunctional catalysts with 3D porous structures, high BET specific surface area, more catalytically active sites, and heteroatom-doping are conducive to the mass and charge transfer, the formation and decomposition of Li2O2, and the surface diffusion of intermediates. Thus, it is also essential for POM derivatives to reasonably arrange these characters together and thereby achieve practical cyclability for LOBs.
4.3 Magnesium-ion batteries
MIBs are drawing attention owing to their prospective benefits including operational safety, high theoretical capacity, and abundant raw materials.314 The conversion mechanism of MIBs is similar to those of LIBs and SIBs.315 But differently, magnesium is inclined to form a dense MgO film on the electrode surface, hindering the ion and electron transfer. In addition, Mg2+ possesses two charges, so it is hard for Mg2+ to transfer to the cathode and the diffusion of such ions is also difficult owing to the ion polarization. Thus, the choice of cathode materials is significant for the development of MIBs.316
In recent years, POM precursors have been explored to facilitate the diffusion of Mg2+. In 2016, Jacobson and co-workers reported a microporous Mo- and V-based molecular sieve MgxMoyVOz cathode for MIBs using Mo7O24 and VOSO4·nH2O as precursors.317 Such architecture provides large open channels for the fast diffusion of small ions. Especially, all of the metal ions with mixed-valences (including V4+, V5+, Mo5+, and Mo6+) actively participated in the electrochemical reaction processes during the insertion of Mg2+, and then these metal ions were reduced when Mg2+ were intercalated into the tunnels. The discharge/charge profiles show that Mo2.48VO9.93 can insert 3.49 Mg2+ per formula unit. Moreover, a V2MoO8 cathode was prepared by Yang and co-workers through electrospinning PVP, Mo7O24, and NH4VO3 precursors.318 The obtained product is well-crystallized with a cuboid architecture (4.20 Å interlayer distance, 4–6 μm length and 300–500 nm thickness) and exhibits an initial discharge capacity of about 200 mA h g−1 with 33% coulombic efficiency. Interestingly, adding extra LiCl into the electrolyte can significantly enhance the specific capacity, cycling stability, and rate performance, and increase the voltage plateau to about 1.5 V. The reasons may be as follows: (1) Li+ insertion stabilizes the phase structure of the binary metallic oxide; (2) both Li+ and Mg2+ participate in the intercalation/deintercalation reactions; (3) Li+ significantly increases the conductivity of the electrolyte and reduces the interfacial reaction resistance. Although the above studies have enhanced the electrochemical performance of MIBs, there are still some challenges that need to be overcome, such as the serious capacity loss during the first two cycles.
4.4 Metal–air batteries
MABs are special kinds of rechargeable batteries with the advantages of safety, resource-abundance, and high theoretical energy density. Magnesium, aluminum, zinc, mercury, or iron is usually used as the anode and oxygen from the air is used as the cathode.319 Although MABs possess stable electrochemical properties and low equilibrium potential, there are still challenges for further exploration, especially the fading of ORR performance owing to the loss of active sites of electrocatalysts.320 As mentioned previously, POM-derived materials are effective electrocatalysts for multiple electrocatalytic reactions; thus, POMs can be employed as precursors to prepare electrode materials for MABs.
Goodenough and co-workers have made significant contributions to the development of rechargeable batteries during these years.321,322 Recently, his group reported a robust IrMn/Fe3Mo3C catalyst by using Mo7O24 as the Mo source, and the derived electrode material exhibits excellent performance in Zn–air batteries.323 As compared with conventional Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts, IrMn/Fe3Mo3C shows improved cycling stability and delivers a voltaic efficiency of 58.4% at the 50th cycle and 56.1% at the 100th cycle, respectively. Such electrode material can also manifest long-term cycling stability with high efficiency over 200 h. Madhuri and co-workers developed a new reaction mechanism through an “adjourn-reaction” scheme by synthesizing a series of air cathodes with various topological architectures (such as marigold-like flowers, thin rod agglomerated flowers, rhombic dodecahedra, or nanorods) using W12O42 and (NH4)2MoO4 as precursors.324 The flower-like derivative exhibits stable cycling performance for 130 discharge/charge cycles over 2.5 h and can extend its long-term stability for 7 days. Amiinu et al. prepared a MOF-derived N-doped carbon framework encapsulated with vertically aligned MoS2 nanosheets by using ZIF-8 as a host and Mo7O24 as a guest.325 This hybrid material exhibits a high BET specific surface area of 520 m2 g−1 and shows an excellent voltaic efficiency of 63% at 5 mA cm−2, as well as superior cycling stability even at 25 mA cm−2 after 48 h. These studies are expected to inspire the design and fabrication of promising electrode materials for wider applications in MABs.
However, CO2 in the air is inclined to react with the alkaline electrolyte and produce carbonates on the surface of the electrode, which may destroy the structures of the electrode materials and decrease the lifetime of batteries.320 POM derivatives also face such challenges and these questions should be addressed in future explorations.
4.5 Redox flow batteries
Based on the electrochemical reactions of redox couples in flowing liquids, RFBs possess the merits of fast response, flexible design, and low cost.326 The main distinctions between RFBs and other rechargeable batteries are the reaction location and active materials. The active materials of RFBs are the flowing electrolytes, and electrolytes are pumped into the stack for redox reactions to occur and to achieve energy conversion. The best advantage of RFBs is that all electrochemical reactions are carried out in the liquid phase, so there is no collapse, agglomeration, or structural change on the electrodes, ensuring the safety and capacity of RFBs.327
POMs have been explored as active materials for redox flow batteries by Lu's group328,329 and Anderson's group.330,331 In addition, Zhang and co-workers developed a super-activated carbon supported tungsten trioxide hybrid material originating from the (NH4)6W7O24·6H2O (W7O24) precursor.332 The redox couples of such electrode material exhibit kinetic reversibility and excellent electrocatalytic activity, largely because the charge transfer resistances are significantly reduced in both negative and positive reactions. The result of electrochemical testing displays no energy efficiency attenuation for 50 cycles at 30 mA cm−2, and the energy efficiency, voltage efficiency, and coulombic efficiency of such vanadium RFB at 50 mA cm−2 are 80.5, 85.2, and 94.5%, respectively.
Currently, the most common RFB is the vanadium redox flow battery, which has been industrially produced and commercially promoted due to the excellent redox properties of vanadium.333 In such batteries, liquid vanadium based oxides or salts are used as the anode and cathode electrolytes. Vanadium-based POMs have various structures and compositions, and might be suitable precursors for preparing active materials for such vanadium redox flow batteries in the future.
4.6 Thermal batteries
Thermal batteries, which use molten salts as electrolyte, exhibit advantages in terms of both high power density and energy density.334 The electrolytes of thermal batteries are usually solid-state materials, so such batteries are widely used in the military. As discussed in the previous sections, POM-derived MoS2 materials show potential applications in most kinds of rechargeable batteries. Zheng et al. investigated the formation mechanism of POM-derived MoS2 microspheres and their discharge mechanism in thermal batteries.335 Significantly, when the metal source was changed from POM (Mo7O24) to a simple metal salt (Na2MoO4·2H2O), the morphology and porosity of the derived architectures displayed an evident distinction, and so did the electrochemical performances. The electrode material from the POM precursor exhibits a specific capacity of 281.25 mA h g−1 at a cut-off voltage of 1 V over 4000 s discharge, showing a much improved performance. This work also provides evidence that POM-derived materials exhibit superior advantages than simple metal salt precursors.
5. Conclusions and outlook
In virtue of the structural diversity of POMs, it is quite beneficial to prepare electrode materials by taking POMs as precursors because POMs can supply multiple metals and construct porous architectures by releasing abundant oxygen atoms during the pyrolysis process. The inherent heteroatoms and external combinations (with MOFs, POPs, graphene, or CNTs) can further improve the electrochemical performances of the obtained materials. This review systematically surveyed recent progress including classical synthetic schemes, electrochemical performances, and the structure–function relationships of the emerging electrode materials originating from POM precursors, especially towards the applications for LIBs, SIBs, LSBs, LOBs, MIBs, MABs, RFBs, and thermal batteries. Benefiting from the inherent advantages of the structural characteristics of POM clusters, these reports have exhibited significantly improved electrochemical performances in both cycling stability and rate capacity. However, there are still challenges and issues in establishing a universal synthetic strategy and defining relationships between the structure and properties, which need to be deeply investigated in future studies (Fig. 12).
 Fig. 12  Summarized illustration and outlook of development strategies of POM derivatives for rechargeable batteries. 
(1) Although POMs have been widely used as precursors to prepare promising electrode materials towards rechargeable batteries, the conversion mechanism of POM precursors to the resulting materials is still ambiguous, resulting in poor controllability in terms of structure, composition, and morphology. This creates an uncertainty with regard to the electrochemical properties induced by the structures. Therefore, understanding the conversion mechanism of POMs and exploring the structure–function relationship are greatly needed to rationally design POM precursors for high electrochemical performance.
(2) The porous structures and high BET specific surface area play important roles in the resulting electrochemical properties. However, the electrode materials originating from POM precursors always exhibit lower BET specific surface area due to the heavier metal atoms. Though porous architectures can be obtained by releasing oxygen atoms in the POM clusters during the pyrolysis process, the contribution is very limited in helping to improve the electrochemical performance. In order to obtain the desired performance, a larger BET specific surface area and porous structure are needed for the final electrode materials, which are helpful in shortening the diffusion paths of both electron and ion transfers, as well as ensuring sufficient contact between the electrode and electrolyte. Thus, convenient and universal synthetic approaches are necessary for the desirable POM-derived electrode materials with high BET specific surface area and other porosity properties. For example, the successful application of templates (such as NaCl, SiO2, etc.) in the preparation of precursors is a major contributor to achieving high porosity.207,210 In future research, the particularly urgent need is to find a convenient and universal method to obtain POM-derived electrode materials with high porosity.
(3) In terms of the synthesis, the typical and commercial POMs, such as Mo7O24, PMo12, or PW12, are most commonly used as the precursors at present. In fact, POMs have plentiful structure types with diverse redox characteristics and topological structures. All these POMs can be used as the precursors to construct electrode materials that may display different performances. For example, Anderson-type POMs have various central heteroatoms (including Ni, Co, Fe, Cr, etc.), and have been investigated as precursors to construct different heteroatom-doped MCs.336 Lindqvist-type POMs, [VnM(6–n)O19](2+n)− (M = WVI or MoVI; n = 0, 1, 2), have also been explored for energy storage, and the mixed metal atoms and valences efficiently enhanced the redox properties.337 Nb- or V-based POMs with strong redox properties and mixed-valence or fully reduced-valence (such as V3IVV3VO19 or V6IVO19)338–340 have been recently explored as excellent candidate electrode materials for LIBs,341–346 SIBs,347 and Zn-ion batteries.348 These latest reports enlighten researchers to explore more alternative POM precursors, especially to excavate those that exhibit superiority in terms of structure and composition.
(4) POMs can be engineered with various matrices (such as GO, CNTs, MOFs, or POPs) to prepare functional POM composite precursors. This is a promising route to obtain superior combined properties as compared with each individual component. But to date, it is still ambiguous how the optimal performance of electrode materials can be obtained through the design of precursor systems. So, particular effort should be devoted to designing composite systems to replace random mixtures. It is well known that POMs are typical electron acceptors in the charge transfer system, which can be combined with electron-donating matrices to achieve composite precursors with specially constructed architectures. In addition, the functionalization of POMs with organic ligands by covalent bonds can yield “organic” POM precursors on the molecular/atomic scale, and conveniently provide abundant carbon sources and heteroatoms (such as N, P, or S), which are favorable for developing multifunctional materials. The study of POM composite precursors for preparing novel materials is still in its infancy, so more explorations are expected to be undertaken in future investigations.
Nevertheless, although many challenges and issues still need to be explored and resolved in depth, the rapid development of POM precursors for rechargeable batteries in recent years has opened up a new avenue for the fabrication of electrode materials, and has brought about a bright future for developing POM derivatives for application in energy storage. With the sustained progress of these POM-derived materials, more extensive applications are expected to be achieved in the electrochemical energy storage field.
