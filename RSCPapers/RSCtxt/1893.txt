    , Accepted 6th November 2019First published on 6th November 2019AbstractPerovskite/silicon tandem technology has emerged as a promising strategy for low-cost and efficient solar energy utilization. However, the performance reduction of silicon bottom cells under low intensity illumination still prevents the tandem systems from yielding ultimate electric power. In this paper, we employed a V-shaped tandem configuration as well as a low parasitic absorption tungsten doped indium oxide (IWO) transparent electric anode, which exhibits only ∼0.6% parasitic absorption for near infrared wavelengths, to achieve a 100% enhancement of incident light intensity for the silicon sub-cell and boost the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the silicon sub-cell to a value of 0.719 V. As a result, by using a 21.13% efficiency silicon solar cell, the tandem system achieves a cumulative efficiency of 25.57% (9.43% from the silicon cell). In addition, the V-shaped tandem system can maintain over 73% output power as the incident angle varies within ±25°.
Introduction
The energy conversion efficiency of a photovoltaic (PV) module plays a significant role in determining the electrical energy yield within a limited irradiated area, which is closely related to the system costs. Thanks to the continuous efforts of the world in the past few decades, the single-junction crystalline silicon solar cell, the dominant PV technology, has approached its theoretical efficiency limit of 29.4%.1 Multi-junction PV technology is one of the effective ways to further improve the efficiency of solar cells and surpass the Shockley–Queisser limit of single-junction cells. Recently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a competitive photovoltaic technology with the efficiency rapidly increasing from 3.8% to 25.2% during the last decade.2–6 Compared with acting as a competitor of silicon PV technology, the PSC is more suitable as a tandem partner due to its tunable bandgap in a desirable range for collaboration with a silicon bottom-cell.7,8 To date, perovskite/silicon tandem devices have achieved 21.8% efficiency with the active area being as large as 16 cm2.9–12 With careful electrical and optical design, it is theoretically feasible for perovskite–silicon tandem devices to achieve an efficiency of over 38%.13
A tandem device can be constructed by monolithic integration (2-terminal) or mechanical coupling (4-terminal). Recently, efficiencies exceeding 25% and 26% for 2-terminal10,14,15 and 4-terminal16,17 perovskite–silicon tandem devices have been reported, respectively. In spite of the additional power electronics, 4-terminal tandem devices are superior in achieving higher efficiency by allowing two sub-cells to be fabricated independently under optimal processing conditions and operating separately at their maximum power points.18,19 Free from the constraints of photocurrent matching, 4-terminal tandem devices can maintain high efficiency with a wide range bandgap of top cells20 and exhibit greater tolerability for spectral variations under real meteorological conditions.21,22
A typical architecture of a 4-terminal tandem device is formed by mechanically stacking a perovskite top cell and a silicon bottom cell in parallel. This requires a semi-transparent PSC with both front and rear transparent electrodes, which will have higher processing requirements.23,24 As an alternative method, spectrum splitting systems allow two sub-cells to operate in their appropriate bands without additional transparent contacts. A measured efficiency of 28% has been demonstrated by coupling PSCs and silicon solar cells with a beam splitter;25 however, introducing a complicated dichroic mirror into a tandem system could potentially increase system costs. Recently, monofacial reflective tandem systems have been proposed,26,27 in which opaque PSCs can simultaneously absorb high-energy photons and reflect unexploited photons to silicon solar cells. Reutilization of reflected visible light from the front surface of PSCs is feasible with this architecture, which can be a key cause of energy loss in other tandem systems.
To date, although a variety of perovskite–silicon tandem architectures have been proposed for achieving higher efficiency, the performance reduction of the silicon bottom cell under low intensity illumination still prevents the tandem systems from yielding ultimate electric power. The PVMirror tandem system, demonstrated recently,28 might provide a solution by concentrating the filtered light on a narrow-bandgap PV cell with a curved arrangement of wide-bandgap PV cells, acting as a trough concentrator. However, poor collection of low-energy diffuse photons and higher requirements of device cleanliness make it a weak competitor with the non-concentration tandem device under outdoor conditions. Recently, a type of heterojunction (HIT) silicon solar cell has been developed as an efficient bifacial PV technology due to its excellent defect passivation, high charge-carrier lifetime and intrinsic bifacial nature, allowing high efficiency energy yield under either front or rear illumination.29 This prompted an attractive V-shaped tandem architecture (as shown in Fig. 1), demonstrated as the bifacial-reflective-tandem-system (BRTS) in this paper, to be developed for practical applications, which consists of one bifacial narrow-bandgap solar cell and two opaque reflective wide-bandgap solar cells for one unit in a system. This is a beneficial combination of the monofacial-reflective-tandem architecture and the PVMirror system, which allows improved illumination intensity on silicon sub-cells by plane-to-plane light concentration without inherent defects, such as strict requirements in optical alignment and insufficient collection of diffuse light, in plane-to-line or plane-to-spot light concentrating systems.

In this paper, we demonstrate a 4-terminal BRTS with 25.57% cumulative efficiency by combining a 21.13% bifacial HIT silicon solar cell with 16.74% PSCs. When using tungsten doped indium oxide (IWO) as the transparent electrode instead of tin doped indium oxide (ITO), the PSCs exhibit an ultra-high average reflectance of >88% for near-infrared light due to low parasitic absorption. Bifacial illumination on the silicon cell successfully increases the open-circuit voltage and the fill factor of the filtered silicon sub-cell, leading to an efficiency enhancement of over 0.4%. We provide an alternative method for the coupling of PSCs and HIT silicon solar cells in a separated configuration. It is different from the textured monolithic tandem devices in that the reduction of optical loss is realized by reutilization of the reflected light from the PSCs to the Si cell. In addition, this work adopts a focus-free concentrating method through a V-shaped configuration for promoting energy yield from bifacial HIT silicon cells, which helps to achieve a comparative efficiency to that of non-concentrating tandem devices with a lower demand for PSC efficiency as well as half of the amount for the silicon cell. Furthermore, this may be a promising approach for the rapid application of perovskite–silicon tandem systems with modularization design.
Results and discussion
A bifacial HIT silicon solar cell for the BRTS
In this paper, a bifacial HIT silicon solar cell is used for the tandem system. The bifacial HIT silicon solar cell is constructed based on Ag grid electrode/transparent conductive oxide (TCO)/n-doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (α-Si:H)/intrinsic α-Si:H/pyramid textured n-type crystalline silicon substrate/intrinsic α-Si:H/p-doped α-Si:H/TCO/Ag grid electrode (as shown in Fig. 2). Excellent defect passivation by intrinsic α-Si:H and high carrier lifetime in the absorber allow lossless transport of minority charge carriers to their collecting contacts regardless of the positions. Thereby, this architecture makes it possible to utilize incident light with high efficiency from either the front or the rear side.
 Fig. 2  Schematic diagram and the FESEM images of the bifacial HIT silicon solar cell. The bifacial transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) and Ag grid electrodes allow dual-side illumination. 
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the front and rear side are shown in Fig. 3a. The fabricated cell achieves efficiencies of 21.13% and 19.76% under front side and rear side illumination, respectively. The values of VOC, FF and JSC of the front side are 0.726 V, 0.804 and 36.19 mA cm−2, respectively. The corresponding parameters of the rear side are 0.726 V, 0.797 and 34.16 mA cm−2, respectively. Thus, the difference in JSC between the front and rear side is the dominant factor that leads to the efficiency difference; however, this is accompanied by an increase in the device performance with little adverse effects on the tandem system.

(b) Transmittance, reflectance and absorptance curves for the bifacial HIT silicon solar cell. (c) EQE spectra of the bifacial HIT silicon solar cell; the integrated current from the EQE of the front side is 38.4 mA cm−2 and that from the EQE of the rear side is 37.0 mA cm−2. 
Since the photoconductivity of p-doped α-Si:H is lower than that of n-doped α-Si:H,30 the thickness of the p-doped α-Si:H layer is correspondingly increased during the preparation process to ensure carrier extraction capability. This leads to the enhancement and red shift of the reflection peak of the rear side (as shown in Fig. 3b), and therefore, the absorption of wavelengths of 350–500 nm at the rear of the HIT cell is decreased. EQE data for the front and rear side are obtained to further demonstrate the influence of different α-Si:H on JSC in detail (as shown in Fig. 3c). The integrated current density from the EQE of the front side amounts to 38.4 mA cm−2 and that from the EQE of the rear side is 37.0 mA cm−2. The current differences between the EQE and J–V curves are probably caused by the shadow area of the probes during J–V testing of the HIT silicon solar cells. In Fig. 3c, it is observed that the difference in EQE between the front and rear side extended to a wavelength of 700 nm, which is larger than the difference in optical absorptions. This shows that the increase in p-doped α-Si:H thickness not only causes a loss in the optical absorption of the cell, but also causes the absorption attenuation in the c-Si substrate. In fact, as a semiconductor material, α-Si:H in HIT cells can cause parasitic absorption of incident light for short wavelengths, although some of the photo-generated carriers can be injected into the c-Si absorber layer.31 Due to the increase in the thickness of the p-doped α-Si:H layer, the parasitic absorption of this layer for short wavelengths will be greater than that of the n-doped α-Si:H layer, resulting in attenuation of the internal quantum efficiency (IQE).32
In general, the differences in optical and IQE for short wavelengths due to the difference in the p-doped α-Si:H and n-doped α-Si:H thickness result in a difference in the short-circuit current density between the front and rear side of the HIT cell under 1 sun irradiation. The difference in efficiency of the front and rear side of HIT cells is a compromise for improving the electrical performance. Nevertheless, in tandem wide-bandgap PSCs, this difference can be effectively eliminated, making the bifacial HIT solar cell a remarkable choice for the BRTS.
The AM1.5G spectral irradiance data33 are plotted in Fig. 4a as a function of wavelength between 300 nm and 1100 nm, describing the distribution of incident power. Dominated by the solar blackbody radiation spectrum, the majority of the incident energy is distributed in the visible light region. By assuming that each single photon with energy greater than the bandgap can generate an electron and a hole in a solar cell, we obtain the theoretical maximum photo-generated current as a function of wavelength (black solid line in Fig. 4a), which shows a more even distribution of the visible and the near infrared wavelengths. The practical photo-generated current of the bifacial HIT silicon solar cell for the front and rear sides are plotted in Fig. 4a as the red and blue solid lines, respectively. As a silicon cell is coupled with a PSC in a monofacial manner, which is currently the mainstream configuration of tandem devices, a mass of high energy photons will be absorbed by the PSC causing a dramatically drop in the quantity of light-generated carriers in the silicon cell, represented by the shaded area in Fig. 4a. This will lead to a drop in VOC, resulting in the performance reduction of silicon sub-cells in such tandem devices. The BRTS enables the silicon solar cell to receive incident power from both the front and rear side, which makes it possible to generate a comparable number of carriers to that in the standalone cell under filtered illumination by employing a top-cell with an appropriate bandgap. Fig. 4b plots the light-generated current for a unit area of the HIT silicon cell as a function of the top-cell's bandgap, demonstrating the quantity variance of carriers between the monofacial and bifacial tandem configurations. It is obvious that as the bandgap of the top-cell varies from 1.4 eV to 2.1 eV, an increasing number of photons will be allocated to the silicon sub-cell, resulting in the monotonous increase of photo-generated carriers. Compared to the monofacial case, the bifacial tandem configuration doubles the quantity of light-generated carriers in the silicon sub-cell and achieves an equivalent number of carriers to that in the standalone cell with a top-cell bandgap of around 1.7 eV. At this point, the open-circuit voltage of the silicon sub-cell is recovered to a value equal to that of the standalone condition. This means that the BRTS is capable of effectively compensating for the performance reduction of silicon cells due to filtered illumination and even has the potential to further improve the performance. Fig. 4d shows the PCE improvement of the silicon sub-cell in the bifacial tandem configuration compared to that of the monofacial case, which monotonously increases as the bandgap of the top-cell increases.

(b) Light-generated current for a unit area of the HIT silicon cell as a function of the top-cell's bandgap. (c) Open-circuit voltage of the HIT silicon cell as a function of the top-cell's bandgap. (d) Efficiency improvement of the bifacial HIT silicon cell as a function of the top-cell's bandgap. 
The theoretical efficiency of the BRTS by combining such a bifacial HIT silicon cell with PSCs with an efficiency equal to the ratio of the detailed balance limit is calculated (see Fig. S1†). The system can achieve a maximum efficiency of around 39.6% by using a PSC with an efficiency equal to the detailed balance limit, whose bandgap is 1.65 eV. Therefore, in this study, we employ a PSC with a bandgap of ∼1.65 eV as a tandem partner of the HIT silicon cell in the BRTS.
Perovskite solar cell for the tandem system
The PSC structure is shown in Fig. 5 with a SEM cross-sectional image, consisting of the glass substrate, IWO transparent contact, SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL), Cs0.05MA0.15FA0.85Pb(I0.75Br0.25)3 perovskite layer, and spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer (HTL), and Au as the reflective back contact. Planar SnO2 with excellent electron extraction34 is introduced as the ETL for the planar fabrication process of the following layers to obtain a planar PSC. At the same time, in order to maximize the energy allocation to the silicon cell, we use IWO with lower parasitic absorption for infrared light as the front transparent contact instead of ITO to improve the reflectivity of the PSC for infrared light.35 Compared to the ITO, the high valence difference between W6+ and In3+ in IWO provides abundant extra vacancies for carriers to realize low resistivity at a low carrier density, resulting in low absorption of photons. The solar-weighted absorptance of the prepared IWO glass is only ∼0.6% for wavelengths from 750 nm to 1100 nm, while that of the commercial-ITO glass is ∼12.4% (see Fig. S2†). As a result, the oblique solar-weighted reflectance at 45° of the PSC fabricated on IWO glass can reach over 88%, while that of the PSC fabricated on a commercial-ITO glass is lower than 65% (see Fig. S3†).

The J–V characteristics for normal incidence of the PSC with the champion efficiency are presented in Fig. 6a, corresponding to an efficiency of 16.74% and are summarized in Table 1. Under normal incidence, the steady-state output efficiency of the PSC is 16.6% (see Fig. 6b), and the integrated current density is 18.7 mA cm−2, obtained from the EQE curve (see Fig. 6c), which shows a 1.66 eV bandgap of the PSC. When the PSC is used in the BRTS, the installation angle is chosen to be 45°, which can ensure equal height of sub-cells and enable normal incidence of the filtered light for the silicon sub-cell, minimizing the requirement of solar cell area while maintaining tandem efficiency.27,36 Hence, the performance of the perovskite is measured under 45° illumination coupled with the front and rear side of the HIT solar cell (as shown in Fig. 6c and d), respectively. The values of VOC under these conditions are, respectively, reduced from 1.188 V to 1.146 V and 1.162 V due to the lower light intensity and the slight misalignment between the mask and the PSC. The integrated current density is slightly reduced from 18.7 mA cm−2 to 18.6 mA cm−2 due to the blue shift of the EQE curve (as shown in Fig. 6e). Although with slight degradation, the PSC maintains 16.05% and 16.22% efficiency under 45° illumination in the reflective tandem system coupled with the front and rear side of the HIT solar cell, respectively.

An efficient perovskite–silicon hybrid system
The spectral characteristics of the PSC are the dominant factors of reflective tandem efficiency that determine the coupling quality of the two sub-cells. We measure the wavelength-dependent reflectance curve of the PSC under 45° incident light, presented in Fig. 7a. The spectral characteristics measured at different incident angles can be found in Fig. S5.† The solar-weighted reflectance for wavelengths of 300–750 nm and 750–1100 nm is calculated, respectively, to evaluate the average reflected energy under AM1.5G illumination. The IWO-based PSC exhibits an average reflectance of 88.5% for wavelengths from 750 nm to 1100 nm. In addition, 16.0% of the energy at short wavelengths, which cannot be absorbed by the PSC, is reflected to the silicon solar cell for reutilization. We measure the performance of the silicon cell under the illumination of reflected light. The results are shown in Fig. 7b and summarized in Table 2. We note that under the illumination of perovskite reflected light, unlike the standalone condition, the JSC difference of the front and rear side of the bifacial silicon cell is narrowed, so that the difference in efficiency is greatly reduced. However, under the single-sided illumination of the reflective filter, the VOC of the silicon cell drops to 0.699 V due to the low illumination intensity, which is unavoidable in the non-concentrating tandem system. When the bifacial silicon cell is exposed to reflected light on both sides, the VOC is immediately increased to 0.719 V, which is close to the VOC of the standalone measurement. Correspondingly, the FF of the silicon cell is slightly improved due to the higher photo-generated carrier concentration,37,38 resulting in a 9.43% efficiency of the sub-cell of the BRTS. The EQE is measured with the perovskite reflective filter for the front and rear sides of the silicon cell, as plotted in Fig. 7c. The EQE curves provide the answer to the reduction in the JSC difference between the front and rear sides of the silicon cell in the system. As mentioned above, the JSC difference between the front and rear sides of the HIT silicon cell is mainly due to the difference in the absorptance and IQE in the short-wavelength band caused by the thickness difference of the α-Si:H layers. In the tandem system, most of this part of the incident light is absorbed by the PSC, while the infrared light is mainly used by the HIT solar cell. As a result, the JSC difference is eliminated, and the disadvantage of high parasitic absorption of the HIT cell in the short-wavelength band is simultaneously avoided. Under the condition in which the HIT solar cell is coupled with mirrors instead of PSCs in a V-shaped configuration, in contrast, the promotion of VOC and FF from dual side illumination unexpectedly leads to no efficiency improvement compared with that from front side illumination, which is caused by the lower current density that is dragged down by the rear side. The measurement results can be found in Fig. S6 and Table S1.†

Fig. 8a shows the J–V results for the champion sub-cells in the BRTS, where the curve in black represents the results for the front side of the Si cell with standalone measurement, the curve in green represents the results of the Si cell with bifacial reflective illumination, and the curve in red/blue represents the forward scan results of the PSC coupled with the front/rear side of the HIT solar cell. The EQE curve is shown in Fig. 8b. The PSC converted visible light into a JSC of 18.6 mA cm−2, while the bifacial silicon cell received the reflected infrared light with the front and rear sides resulting in a JSC of 18.0 mA cm−2 and 17.6 mA cm−2, respectively. As a result, the JSC difference is eliminated, and the disadvantage of the high parasitic absorption of the HIT cell in the short-wavelength band is simultaneously avoided. Meanwhile, with the reutilization of visible light, the EQE of the system is enhanced to over 95% at around 550 nm. As summarized in Table 3, the BRTS achieves a cumulative efficiency of 25.57% by combining a silicon sub-cell with 9.43% efficiency and PSCs with 16.14% average efficiency in the BRTS.

Angular dependence analysis of the BRTS
To further evaluate the potential of the BRTS to operate under outdoor conditions, where incident light can irradiate it from different angles due to varying positions of the sun and the scattering effect caused by the atmospheric particles, the angular dependent properties of the BRTS need to be investigated. Fig. 9a and b demonstrate the geometric optical path irradiating the BRTS with incident angles less and greater than 45°, respectively. With oblique incident light, the BRTS no longer operates under the design conditions, and therefore, energy loss is inevitable. Some of the incident light will be reflected by the PSCs into the atmosphere without being utilized by the silicon sub-cell, and some will directly be received by the silicon sub-cell. Moreover, as the incident angle increases above 45°, one of the PSCs will be shaded. In order to evaluate the angular dependent properties, the VOC values of the PSC and HIT solar cell are measured under different light intensities (Fig. 9a). The deviation of the slope from kT/q (k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature and q is the elementary charge) represents the non-ideal diode factor of the solar cell (described in eqn (4)), which indicates the recombination rate. The PSC shows a slope of 1.46kT/q under forward scanning (FS) and a slope of 1.61kT/q under reverse scanning (RS). The HIT solar cell shows a slope of 1.54kT/q under front side illumination and a similar slope of 1.52kT/q under rear side illumination. The low slopes indicate low recombination in both cells, which can also be embodied in the high VOC of the devices under 1 sun illumination.

(d) The angular dependent solar weighted reflectance (SWR) and absorptance (SWA) of the PSC and HIT solar cell, respectively. (e) The normalized efficiency of the PSC, the HIT silicon solar cell, and the system with different incident angles. 
Additionally, the angular dependent optical properties of the PSC and the HIT solar cell are measured (see Fig. S5†), and the solar weighted reflectance (SWR) and absorptance (SWA) of the PSC and HIT solar cell are given in Fig. 9d, respectively. The SWA of the front side and the rear side of the HIT solar cell shows a similar trend for both the short wavelength and long wavelength bands and decreases slowly as the incident angle increases from 8° to 80°. As the incident angle increases, the SWR of the PSC decreases for the short wavelength band and increases for the long wavelength band roughly. The small peaks that appear at around 55° are probably caused by the sudden rise of reflectance near the Brewster angle. The normalized e of the BRTS and the sub-cells is calculated with incident angle variation from −80° to 80° (as shown in Fig. 9e). It is found that the normalized efficiency of the Si sub-cell shows a similar trend of the cosine law due to its angular independent SWA for varying incident angles. Meanwhile, as the incident angle θ varies from 0 to 80°, the incident angle to PSC1 varies from −45° to 35°, where the SWR of PSC1 nearly remains unchanged. Thus, the output power of PSC1 is determined from the projected area, exhibiting an almost similar curve to cosine θ. In contrast, as the incident angle θ varies from 0 to −80°, the incident angle to PSC1 varies from −45° to over −90° (no illumination), and the normalized efficiency decreases linearly to zero at −45°. PSC2 shows symmetric results with PSC1, as they are installed symmetrically. As a result, the normalized efficiency of the system shows a trend between the linear and cosine law due to the combined effects of the sub-cells. Nevertheless, the normalized efficiency of the system can be maintained above 0.73 as the incident angle changes within ±25°, which includes the noonday sun elevation angle range within a year.
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate a V-shaped 4-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem configuration to enhance energy yield by eliminating the performance reduction of the silicon sub-cell under filtered illumination through a plane-to-plane reflecting strategy. The introducing of the IWO transparent electrode with 0.6% parasitic absorption of near infrared light results in an excellent average reflectance over 88% between 750 and 1100 nm for the PSCs. With highly consistent performance from the front and rear sides of the bifacial HIT silicon cell in tandem configuration, the efficiency of the silicon sub-cell is enhanced from 9.00% to 9.43%. As a result, by combining a PSC with a standalone efficiency of just 16.74% and a bifacial HIT silicon cell with a standalone efficiency of 21.13%, we obtain a 4-terminal tandem device with 25.57% efficiency, which is 21% higher than the efficiency of the silicon cell. In addition, the V-shaped tandem system can maintain over 73% output power as the incident angle varies within ±25°. This study shows the potential of the V-shaped tandem configuration for impressive energy yields as well as its feasibility for practical applications.
Methods
Definition of equations
The efficiencies of tandem systems corresponding to the cutoff wavelength λC (corresponding to the bandgap of the top-cell) are calculated using:15 (1)where I(λ) is the spectral irradiance of AM1.5G, ηS–Q(λC) is the detailed-balance efficiency (S–Q limit) for λC, and C is a coefficient lower than 1. In eqn (1), f1 and f2 represent ratios of the photo-generated current of filtered silicon cells to that of unfiltered silicon cells, defined as: (2)where φ(λ) is the spectral reflectance of the PSCs and EQESi(λ) is the external quantum efficiency of the silicon cells. In eqn (1), ηSi(λ) is the spectral efficiency of silicon cells expressed as: (3)where VOC and FF are the open-circuit voltage and fill factor of the silicon solar cells, respectively. JSC(λ) is the short-circuit current density per unit wavelength defined as: (4)where q is the elementary charge, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light and EQE(λ) is the external quantum efficiency of the cells. For the varying illumination intensity, the VOC in eqn (3) should be considered to be:39 (5)where V0 and J0 are the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current density of the cell under normal incidence, respectively, and where m is the non-ideal diode factor, k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the cell temperature. The solar-weighted reflectance and absorptance are defined as: (6)where R(λ) and A(λ) are the wavelength-dependent reflectance and absorptance, respectively.
Materials
Cesium iodide (CsI) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Lead iodide (PbI2) and lead bromide (PbBr2) were purchased from TCI. Formamidinium iodide (FAI) and methylammonium bromide (MABr) were purchased from Lumtec Technology Corp., Taiwan. Spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Potassium chloride (KCl) was purchased from Aladdin.
Preparation of substrates
The IWO glass or ITO glass substrates were cleaned with detergent water, deionized water and ethyl alcohol for 20 min, respectively. After drying using a gas flow, the substrates were treated with ozone-ultraviolet for 15 min before use. The SnO2 films were achieved by the chemical bath deposition method on the IWO glass and ITO glass, followed by annealing at 180 °C for 1 h. After this, a KCl passivation layer was spin-coated on the SnO2 layer at 4000 rpm for 20 s with a 2.5 mg mL−1 KCl solution, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 20 min.
Preparation of the mixed perovskite precursor
The Cs0.05MA0.15FA0.85Pb(I0.75Br0.25)3 perovskite precursor was prepared by dissolving 1.4 M as-purchased compounds (0.07 CsI, 0.21 MABr, 0.42 PbBr2, 1.12 FAI and 0.98 PbI2) in a mixed solvent of DMF/DMSO (4:1 v/v).
Preparation of the spiro-OMeTAD solution
The spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by first dissolving 73 mg spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL chlorobenzene with the addition of 18 μL of 520 mg mL−1 Li-TFSI and 29 μL of 300 mg mL−1 FK209 in ACN and 30 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP).
Device fabrication of the perovskite solar cell
The perovskite precursor was spin-coated on the SnO2/KCl substrate at 6000 rpm for 30 s with an acceleration speed of 1000 rpm. And then 100 μL of ethyl acetate was dropped on the substrate in the 25th second as the anti-solvent. After this, the substrate was annealed at 120 °C for 40 min on a hotplate. After cooling down, the spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 30 s with an acceleration speed of 3000 rpm. Finally, a 60 nm thick gold film was deposited by thermal evaporation on the spiro-OMeTAD layer as the metal electrode. Large area reflective perovskite mirrors were fabricated by the same procedure as that for the small devices with a higher solution dosage.
Characterization
The cross-sectional structure of the PSC was obtained by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800). The spectral characteristics of the PSC and silicon cell were obtained using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Agilent Cary-5000). The J–V curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM1.5 G illumination with a solar simulator (Oriel 94023A, 300 W). An intensity of 1000 W m−2 was calibrated using a standard silicon reference solar cell (Oriel, VLSI Standards). The active area of the small PSC devices was defined using a mask of 0.1444 cm2 at either normal incidence or 45° oblique incidence. The active area of the bifacial HIT solar cell in the reflective tandem system was defined using masks with 3.24 cm2 apertures for each side illumination.
