    , Accepted 1st October 2015First published on 2nd October 2015AbstractAfter a self-organized TiO2 nanotube film on a Ti substrate was fabricated through anodic oxidation, SnO2 nanoparticles were deposited on the film by a facile ultrasonic assisted deposition method. The photoelectrochemical performances of the prepared SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite films were evaluated by measuring their incident photon to current conversion efficiencies, transient photocurrents, and photopotentials.

1. Introduction
Among the various semiconductors, nanostructured titanium dioxide (TiO2) has drawn considerable attention in the academic field due to its special properties, such as low cost, low toxicity, easy fabrication, high physical and chemical stability, and good photosensitivity.1–3 As a result, it has been widely used in many fields, such as dye-sensitized solar cells,4,5 photodegradation of organic compounds,6 photocatalytic water splitting,7 gas sensors,8,9 photocathodic protection,10,11 and biomedical devices.12 However, TiO2 with an intrinsic band gap can only be excited by UV light, which accounts for 4–5% of the solar spectrum.13,14 The developed methods for extending the photoresponse of TiO2 to the visible region include: sensitizing TiO2 with narrow band gap semiconductors, such as CdS,15,16 CdSe,17 Bi2S3,18 and CdTe,19 and doping TiO2 with metals20,21 or nonmetals.22,23 Moreover, photogenerated carriers of TiO2 are prone to recombination. One of the effective approaches to improve the charge separation efficiency of TiO2 is coupling the TiO2 film with another semiconductor with suitable conduction and valence band potentials.24–26 Since the conduction band edge of SnO2 is lower than that of TiO2, the conduction band of SnO2 can act as an “electron pool” to save the photogenerated electrons when they are coupled with each other. That is, the photogenerated electrons are transferred from the conduction band of TiO2 to that of SnO2, simultaneously, the photogenerated holes move in the opposite direction and are accumulated in the valence band of the TiO2.27 Therefore, coupling TiO2 with SnO2 has attracted much attention.28–33 For example, Shi and co-workers have synthesized ultrafine SnO2–TiO2 coupled semiconductor particles by homogeneous precipitation.28 The coupled particles showed better photoactivity than the pure TiO2 particles. Tai prepared a SnO2–TiO2 coupled film electrode by a sol–gel method,29 and found that the maximum incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the film reached about 30.5% at 520 nm wavelength in the coupled solar cell. Akurati et al.30 developed a one-step flame method and successfully synthesized SnO2–TiO2 composite nanoparticles with improved photocatalytic activity. However, the above coupled semiconductor particles were randomly distributed over the substrate surfaces. Compared with TiO2 nanoparticles, the self-organized TiO2 nanotube arrays formed on the Ti substrates could provide shortcuts for electron transfer along the nanotube walls because of their highly ordered structures.31 Therefore, preparation of SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite films is of great importance. Recently, Du and co-workers32 prepared a SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite film as a three-dimensional electrode by a solvothermal method for lithium ion microbatteries, and found that the deposited SnO2 nanoparticles on the TiO2 nanotube film could greatly enhance the capacity of the microbatteries. Chai and co-workers33 reported that the novel sieve-like SnO2–TiO2 nanotube film fabricated by a block copolymer soft template method exhibited a high photoelectric conversion efficiency, which was 3.1 times higher than that of the TiO2 nanotube film under 365 nm light irradiation.
A sonochemistry method is an attractive and robust technique for synthesizing novel materials with superior properties. For example, Ma et al.34 have prepared N-doped carbon dots by a one-pot ultrasonic reaction between glucose and ammonium hydroxide, and found that they exhibited strong luminescence in the visible-to-near infrared range and clear upconversion photoluminescence properties. Additionally, Xu et al.35 have synthesized ultrathin CdS nanosheets by an ultrasonic-induced aqueous exfoliation method. The nanosheets exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity and good stability under visible light illumination. The ultrasonic method has also been found to be a useful technique for preparing composite films. For example, Fe doped, Ag loaded, or CdS incorporated TiO2 nanotube composite films have been previously reported by our group.36–38
In the present work, an ultrasonic-assisted impregnation-calcination method was used to prepare SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite films. With this method, the amount of SnO2 on the TiO2 nanotube film could be easily controlled by adjusting the ultrasonic deposition time. The photoelectrochemical performances of the SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite films were examined. Besides, the application of the composite films as photoanodes for the photocathodic protection of 403 stainless steel (403SS) was investigated.
2. Experimental
Preparation of SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite films
Commercial Ti foils (99.7% purity) with dimensions of 15 mm × 10 mm × 0.1 mm were used as specimens for preparing SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite films. Before experiments, the foils were ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water successively, and then dried at room temperature.
The vertically oriented TiO2 nanotube films were prepared by direct anodic oxidation of the cleaned Ti foils at 20 V for 30 min in a two-electrode electrolytic cell containing an aqueous glycerol solution with 0.5 wt% NH4F and 40 vol% water. The Ti foil and a platinum sheet served as the working electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. After the anodization, the samples were rinsed with deionized water to remove the adsorbed ions, and then were thermally treated at 450 °C for 2 h in a normal air atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1.
SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite films were prepared by an ultrasonic-assisted deposition method. The pre-prepared TiO2 nanotube films were immersed in a 10 mM SnCl2 ethanol solution and irradiated by using an ultrasonic generator (KQ2200DB, Kunshan Ultrasonic Instrument Co., Ltd.) at a frequency of 40 kHz for different times. After that, the films were rinsed with ethanol, annealed at 500 °C for 2 h in a normal air atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1, and then naturally cooled down to room temperature.
Characterization
The morphologies of the prepared TiO2 nanotube film and SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite films were observed by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi FE-SEM S4800) operating at 15 kV. The crystallographic structures of the films were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Panalytical X'pert PRO) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at a scan rate of 10° min−1 ranging from 20° to 80°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI Quantum 2000) was employed to characterize the surface chemical compositions of the films. The XPS spectra were normalized with respect to the C 1s line of adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV. The photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed by using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-7000) by using 350 nm excitation wavelength. The Raman spectroscopy measurements were carried out in air on a LabRamIRaman system (Dilor, France) with an excitation wavelength of 632.8 nm.
The Mott–Schottky measurements were performed in a three-electrode cell with a 0.5 M KOH solution under dark conditions. The prepared TiO2 nanotube film or SnO2–TiO2 composite film was used as the working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a platinum wire served as the reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. The data were collected at a frequency of 1 kHz. The capacitance of the semiconductor film is described by the following Mott–Schottky equation:39 (1)wherein e is the fundamental charge constant, ε is the dielectric constant of TiO2, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, ND is the donor density, E is the applied potential, EFB is the flat-band potential, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and kT/e is a temperature-dependent correction term.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The transient photocurrent measurements were carried out in a single three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell with the TiO2 nanotube film or SnO2–TiO2 composite film as the working electrode, an SCE as the reference electrode, and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. A 0.5 M KOH aqueous solution served as the electrolyte in the cell. The measurement system was assembled with a potentiostat/galvanostat (model 263A, Princeton Applied Research, USA) and an LHX 150 W Xe lamp as the source of illumination.
The IPCE of the prepared films at different wavelengths was determined from the short circuit photocurrents monitored at different excitation wavelengths by using the following expression:40 IPCE (%) = 1240 Isc/λIinc × 100%(2)where Isc (A cm−2) is the photocurrent density at a specific wavelength, Iinc is the incident light power (W cm−2), and λ (nm) is the excitation wavelength. The experimental setup for the IPCE measurements was similar to that for the transient photocurrent measurements. The measurement system was further equipped with a model 5210 lock-in amplifier (Signal Recovery, USA) with a chopper (model ND-4, f = 34 Hz, China), and the 150 W xenon lamp was connected to a SBP 300 monochromator.
To investigate the application of the prepared SnO2–TiO2 nanotube film in photoelectrochemical anticorrosion, the photocathodic protection effect of the film on 403SS was evaluated by measuring the potential variations of the 403SS coupled with different film photoanodes under intermittent illumination. The measurements were conducted by using a home-assembled measurement system including a photoelectrochemical cell with a 0.5 M KOH solution and a corrosion cell with a 0.5 M NaCl solution. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. The system is assembled by using a computer-controlled model 263A potentiostat/galvanostat (Princeton Applied Research, USA) and a LHX 150 W Xe lamp as the white light source, etc., which is similar to those described in our previous study.41 403SS was used as the metal to be protected for evaluating the photocathodic protection effects of the prepared films. Before the test, 403SS plate specimens with dimensions of 10 mm × 10 mm × 1 mm were mechanically sanded with SiC paper from 600 to 1500 grit, then polished with 1.0 μm Al2O3 powder, and eventually ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, ethanol and deionized water in sequence. A salt bridge (1.0 M KCl in agar contained in a flexible glass tube) was used to connect the photoelectrochemical cell and the corrosion cell. A Cu wire was used to couple the film photoanode with the 403SS. The 403SS plate, an SCE and a platinum sheet served as the working electrode (WE), the reference electrode (RE) and the counter electrode (CE) in the corrosion cell, respectively. To further evaluate the photocathodic protection effect of the prepared films, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed at the corrosion potentials of 403SS by applying an AC voltage of 10 mV over the frequency range of 10−2 to 105 Hz. Autolab EIS fitting software was used to analyze the obtained EIS results.

3. Results and discussion
Characterization of films
SEM images of a typical TiO2 nanotube film and SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite films prepared for different ultrasonic deposition times are shown in Fig. 2. It is clear that a highly ordered one-dimensional TiO2 nanotube array film was obtained; the average inner tube diameter was about 100 nm (Fig. 2a). After the deposition of SnO2 nanoparticles on the nanotube films (as shown in Fig. 2b–d), the ordered nanotube arrays remained perfect, but the TiO2 nanotube surfaces became slightly rough. Also, the wall thickness of the nanotubes and the number of SnO2 nanoparticles increased with the ultrasonic deposition time. The cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 2e) of the SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite film obtained by 20 min ultrasonic deposition showed that the nanotubes were perpendicular to the Ti substrate, and that SnO2 nanoparticles could be deposited onto the TiO2 nanotubes. The energy diffraction spectrum (EDS) of the composite film prepared by 20 min ultrasonic deposition showed the presence of Sn besides the bulk Ti and O (Fig. 2f), implying that SnO2 nanoparticles were successfully deposited onto the TiO2 nanotube film.

The XPS measurements were carried out to further confirm the EDS result and determine the surface chemical composition of the SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite film prepared by 20 min ultrasonic deposition. The high resolution XPS spectra of O 1s, Ti 2p, and Sn 3d are shown in Fig. 3a–c, respectively. Two peaks located at 531.1 eV and 529.6 eV were attributed to O 1s (Fig. 3a). The prominent peak centered at about 529.6 eV was assigned to the lattice oxygen for the chemical bonding of the O atom with the metals (Sn and Ti), whereas the binding energy of 531.1 eV was ascribed to the surface hydroxyl oxygen (O–H).42–44 The binding energies of 458.4 eV and 464.4 eV in the XPS spectra of Ti 2p corresponded to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 of Ti4+, respectively (Fig. 3b).45–47 As presented in Fig. 3c, the two peaks located at 494.7 eV and 486.3 eV in the XPS spectra of Sn 3d corresponded to Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2, respectively, which indicated the existence of SnO2 in the composite film.48–50 Based on these results, it can be concluded that SnO2 had been successfully deposited onto the surface of the TiO2 nanotube film by using the facile ultrasonic deposition technique.

The XRD patterns of the pure TiO2 nanotube film and the SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite film prepared by 40 min ultrasonic deposition are shown in Fig. 4a. All the diffraction peaks from the pure TiO2 film were assigned to the Ti substrate and the anatase phase of TiO2 (JCPDS: no. 89-2762), and no other crystalline phases of TiO2 were detected. After the deposition of SnO2 nanoparticles onto the TiO2 nanotube film, the dominant phase of TiO2 was still anatase, and no noticeable phase transformation of TiO2 was observed for the SnO2–TiO2 composite film. Phase transformation of TiO2 did not occur in other composite films for the shorter deposition times either (not presented here). A characteristic peak originated from SnO2 centered at 37.8° corresponded to the (200) plane of the tetragonal rutile structure of SnO2 (JCPDS: no. 046-1088), which was weak relative to the TiO2 nanotube film due to the limited amount of SnO2. This result indicated that the deposition of SnO2 nanoparticles did not obviously affect the phase transformation of TiO2 by 500 °C calcination, which could be further verified by the Raman spectra of the prepared films as shown in Fig. 4b. The Raman response of the SnO2–TiO2 composite film was identical to that of the pure TiO2 nanotube film; all the Raman peaks were ascribed to anatase TiO2, and no other phases of TiO2 could be observed.51

The PL measurement technique is a powerful tool to disclose the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, immigration and transfer, and to understand the fate of electron–hole pairs in semiconductors.52 For nanostructured anatase TiO2 materials, the PL spectra are related to self-trapping excitation, oxygen vacancies and surface states.53,54 The lower the PL intensity, the higher the charge carrier separation efficiency.55Fig. 5 presents the PL spectra of the TiO2 nanotube film and the SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite films prepared for different ultrasonic deposition times. The peaks at about 456 nm, 468 nm, 484 nm, and 593 nm for the TiO2 nanotube film were similar to those reported in previous reports, and could be attributed to the oxygen vacancy states of TiO2.54,56 Obviously, the PL peak shapes of the SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite films were similar to those of the pure TiO2 nanotube film, which could be interpreted as follows. On the one hand, no new luminescence centers were induced after incorporating SnO2 into the TiO2 nanotube film. On the other hand, the characteristic peaks of the TiO2 film were so prominent that they covered the peaks originated from the SnO2 particles. If the ultrasonic deposition time was longer (1 h), the luminescence peaks resulting from SnO2 could be clearly observed during our experiments (not presented here). The photoluminescence intensity of the TiO2 film and the composite films prepared for different deposition times followed this progression: TiO2 > SnO2–TiO2 (40 min) > SnO2–TiO2 (10 min) > SnO2–TiO2 (20 min). The reduction of the PL intensity of the composite films relative to the pure TiO2 nanotube film indicated that the recombination of charge carriers was greatly suppressed by loading SnO2 on the TiO2 nanotube film. The lowest PL intensity of the SnO2–TiO2 film by 20 min deposition implied that this film could exhibit the highest charge separation efficiency. Therefore, this composite film was expected to have the highest photoelectrochemical activity, and 20 min was the optimum deposition time under our experimental conditions.

Fig. 6 presents the Mott–Schottky plots of the TiO2 nanotube film and the SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite film obtained by 20 min ultrasonic deposition. The positive slopes of the linear parts indicated the n-type semiconductor nature of the film samples. For the SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite film, TiO2 was present predominantly in the film, so the relationship between C−2 and the applied potential was applicable for both the pure TiO2 nanotube film and the SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite film.

Obviously, the slope of the Mott–Schottky plot of the SnO2–TiO2 film decreased in comparison with the TiO2 film. As expected, the SnO2–TiO2 film exhibited a higher donor density. The quantitative donor density (ND) values calculated from the Mott–Schottky equation were 1.29 × 1019 cm−3 and 5.28 × 1019 cm−3 for the TiO2 film and the SnO2–TiO2 film, respectively. Namely, the donor density of the SnO2–TiO2 film was higher than that of the TiO2 film, suggesting that the SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite film might show a better photoelectrochemical performance, which will be further discussed in the following section. The main electron donor in a TiO2 film generally results from the oxygen vacancy.57 The deposition of SnO2 nanoparticles onto the TiO2 film was beneficial to increase the oxygen vacancies in the TiO2 film.48,57 Besides, a negative shift of EFB of the SnO2–TiO2 film could also be found from its Mott–Schottky plot compared with that of the TiO2 film. This finding was in agreement with previous reports in the literature.58 The negative shift of EFB meant a shift away from the redox potential; thereby a higher charge separation efficiency of the SnO2–TiO2 film might be obtained.
Photoelectrochemical properties
IPCE, also known as external quantum efficiency (EQE), is a useful parameter to evaluate the photoelectric conversion efficiency, which is the ratio of electrons collected per incident photon as a function of excitation wavelength. So IPCE measurements were made to study the photoresponse of the TiO2 film and the SnO2–TiO2 films prepared for different ultrasonic deposition times. Fig. 7 displays the IPCE spectra of the different films. It can be seen that a dramatic increase of the IPCE value was obtained for the composite films compared with the pure TiO2 film in the same wavelength region. The maximum value as high as 89.98% at 335 nm was achieved for the SnO2–TiO2 composite film prepared by 20 min ultrasonic deposition (Fig. 7c). The IPCE of the composite film prepared by 10 min ultrasonic deposition (Fig. 7b) was a little higher than that by 40 min deposition (Fig. 7d). The charge separation and transfer process for the composite films could be depicted as follows. Under white light illumination, both TiO2 and SnO2 were excited and an energy gradient could be built within the two semiconductors due to the energy difference between them. Eventually, the photogenerated charge carriers could be transferred in certain directions. That is to say, the photogenerated electrons in the TiO2 conduction band were transferred to the SnO2 conduction band, meanwhile, the generated holes were transferred from the SnO2 valence band to the TiO2 valence band and preferentially scavenged by OH− in the electrolyte, not the other way around. Besides, the formation of the mixed-cation composition (SnxTi1−xO2) at the interface and the associated modulation of electronic properties might facilitate the exciton generation and separation.59 So an enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiency was obtained for the composite films. When compared with the composite film prepared by 20 min ultrasonic deposition, the IPCE value by 10 min ultrasonic deposition was relatively low due to the less amount of SnO2 deposited on the TiO2 nanotube film surface. In contrast, the increased coverage of SnO2 particles on the TiO2 nanotube film surface for 40 min ultrasonic deposition made the IPCE of the composite film lower due to the decreased photoresponse of the TiO2 film. This might be rationalized as the overly high amount of SnO2 upshifting the TiO2 band gap (SnO2 as an n-type semiconductor with a band gap of 3.8 eV) and creating more interfaces, which subsequently could reduce the light absorption efficiency and impede the photogenerated charge separation.58
 Fig. 7  IPCE spectra of (a) the TiO2 nanotube film and the SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite films prepared by ultrasonic deposition for different times: (b) 10, (c) 20, and (d) 40 min. 
The time-dependent photocurrent measurements were carried out by using several on/off cycles of white light illumination to evaluate the sensitivity of the prepared films to light, which is a key factor for the practical photoelectrochemical anticorrosion application. From Fig. 8, it can be observed that the photocurrent densities of the SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite films were obviously higher than that of the pure TiO2 film, indicating that the SnO2 nanoparticles could enhance the photoresponse of the TiO2 films. The highest photocurrent density of about 75.4 μA cm−2 was obtained for the SnO2–TiO2 composite film prepared by 20 min ultrasonic deposition, showing the best photoelectrochemical response among these films. However, the composite film prepared by 40 min ultrasonic deposition showed the lowest photocurrent density value. These results suggested that the ultrasonic deposition time had a great impact on the photoelectrochemical activity of the composite film, which is in good agreement with the results of the IPCE measurements. As it can be seen, the transient photocurrent density of the composite film showed a decreasing trend when the deposition time was 40 min, so further extension of the deposition time was not performed. It is worth noting that no anodic or cathodic photocurrent peaks were observed, indicating that the photogenerated electrons of the composite films were predominantly transported to the Ti substrate rather than to the film/solution interface.

Photocathodic protection by semiconductor films for metals is a promising and environmentally friendly cathodic protection method,60–63 which is of great significance for corrosion control of metals. The basic principle of the photocathodic protection is that electrons can be generated in the semiconductor film under light illumination and transferred to the metal coupled with the film, and the potential of the metal moves to a more negative value than its corrosion potential, and thus the metal corrosion is controlled.61
In this work, we investigated the photocathodic protection effect of the prepared SnO2–TiO2 nanotube film on 403SS to evaluate its application in photoelectrochemical anticorrosion. Fig. 9 shows the time evolution of the potential of 403SS in a 0.5 M NaCl solution coupled to the different films. Obviously, the potential values of the 403SS coupled to the TiO2 film or the SnO2–TiO2 composite film prepared by 20 min ultrasonic deposition immediately shifted negatively to a lower potential (namely the photopotential) under white light illumination. This was due to the fact that photogenerated electrons were transferred from the film photoanodes to 403SS and caused the cathodic polarization of the steel. Therefore, the potential of 403SS decreased and was significantly lower than its corrosion potential (about 60 mV vs. SCE), which meant that 403SS was cathodically protected effectively. The photopotentials of the 403SS coupled to the TiO2 nanotube film and the SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite film under light illumination were stabilized at −361 mV vs. SCE and −430 mV vs. SCE, respectively, indicating that more photogenerated electrons were transferred from the SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite film to 403SS due to its higher charge separation efficiency. When the light was cut off, the potentials of 403SS quickly increased to about −180 mV vs. SCE and −396 mV vs. SCE due to its coupling to the TiO2 nanotube film and SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite film, respectively. When the light was turned on again after the break, the potential of the coupled 403SS again decreased to the same photopotential value as before. It is noteworthy that the photopotential was stable during the light illumination. When the light was turned off again, the potential of the 403SS coupled to the composite film was lower than that to the pure TiO2 film, and this lower potential could remain over 17 h after the illumination was stopped. Based on the above analyses, it can be concluded that the composite film could provide a better photocathodic protection effect for 403SS than that provided by the pure TiO2 film.

The EIS measurements were also carried out to evaluate the photocathodic protection effects of the TiO2 and SnO2–TiO2 nanotube films on 403SS. Fig. 10 presents the Nyquist plots of the 403SS uncoupled and coupled to the TiO2 nanotube film and the SnO2–TiO2 composite film. From each Nyquist plot, only one impedance arc was observed, which could be analyzed by using the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 11. Where Rs and Rct represent the solution resistance and the charge transfer resistance, respectively. A constant phase element (CPE) is used to describe the capacitance due to the non-ideal capacitance nature of the electrode/solution interface, which is defined as follows:64 Z(CPE) = [Y0(jω)n]−1(3)where Y0 is a parameter with dimensions of Ω−1 cm−2 sn, ω is the angular frequency in rad s−1, and n represents the deviated degree of the capacitance of the solid electrode double-layer from the ideal condition. For n = 0, the CPE stands for a pure resistor, for n = 1, the CPE stands for a pure capacitor. According to the fitting results, the Rct value of the uncoupled 403SS was as high as 1240 kΩ cm2, whereas the Rct values were 12.0 kΩ cm2 and 4.06 kΩ cm2 for the 403SS coupled to the pure TiO2 nanotube film and the SnO2–TiO2 composite film under white light illumination, respectively. Apparently, both of the coupled 403SS were featured by the significantly lower Rct values. The remarkably decreased Rct values suggested that a large number of photogenerated electrons migrated from the film photoanodes to the 403SS surface and speeded up the electrochemical reaction (oxygen reduction) at the 403SS/solution interface. The smaller Rct value of the 403SS coupled to the SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite film than that to the pure TiO2 nanotube film implied that more photogenerated electrons were transferred to the 403SS surface under light illumination. The above results demonstrated that the SnO2–TiO2 nanotube film could provide a more effective cathodic protection effect for steel than that provided by the TiO2 nanotube film due to the more efficient charge separation and transfer process. Furthermore, in our future work, the application of the SnO2–TiO2 nanotube film prepared by the facile ultrasonic deposition in other fields will be investigated.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a highly ordered SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite film has been successfully fabricated by an anodic oxidation method combined with a facile ultrasonic-assisted deposition technique. The deposition of SnO2 nanoparticles onto the TiO2 nanotube film greatly enhanced the photoelectrochemical properties of the TiO2 nanotube film as revealed by the transient photocurrent measurements and IPCE results. The SnO2–TiO2 nanotube composite film prepared by 20 min ultrasonic deposition exhibited the highest photoconversion efficiency. The photocathodic protection application showed that the SnO2–TiO2 nanotube film as a photoanode could provide a more effective protection effect for 403SS than that provided by the pure TiO2 film, which is of great importance for corrosion protection of metals.
