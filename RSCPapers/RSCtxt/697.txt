    , Accepted 26th March 2012First published on 27th March 2012AbstractA Cu2S–CuInS2–ZnSe quantum dot (QD)-sensitized solar cell with cascaded energy gap structures has been fabricated. Under simulated illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2), the best device is obtained with a Cu2S–CuInS2–ZnSe QD-sensitized solar cell, yielding a power conversion efficiency of 2.52%.
Since the first report of a dye-sensitized solar cell developed by O'Regan and Gratzel in 1991,1 this solar-cell configuration has gained much attention as a low-cost alternative to conventional thin-film solar cells. The development of a new sensitizer has played a decisive role in enhancing overall efficiency and device stability. In searching for the next-generation sensitizer, quantum dots (QDs) have recently been extensively studied as a promising candidate to replace molecular dyes in conventional dye-sensitized solar cells because of their unique advantages. For example, the energy band gap of QDs can be tailored by changing their size, which allows their absorption spectra to be tuned to match the spectral distribution of sunlight. QDs have higher extinction coefficients and larger intrinsic dipole moments. Moreover, QDs have the ability to utilize their electrons to generate multiple electron–hole pairs per photon owing to the impact ionization effect.
Much of the research related to QD sensitizers have been performed on narrow-band-gap semiconductor QDs, such as CdS, CdSe, CdTe, PbS, SbS3, and InAs.2–7 However, despite their appealing photovoltaic performance, the intrinsic toxicity of cadmium, lead, antimony, and arsenic makes the future applicability of these QDs doubtful because of concerns about potential health and environmental risks with respect to large-scale commercial applications. Additionally, the absorption edges of current QD-sensitized solar cells (which are often based on CdS and CdSe) do not make full use of infrared solar light. Recently, I–III–VI ternary semiconductor nanocrystals such as CuInS2 have emerged as possible alternatives for the formation of QDs. These materials are of particular interest because they are direct band gap semiconductors with high extinction coefficients (∼105 cm−1) in the visible-to-near-infrared region and contain no highly toxic elements. Although a number of successful approaches to prepare CuInS28–12 QD-sensitized solar cells have been reported, the heavy-metal ion cadmium10–12 is still required for improving the power conversion efficiency or light-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency. Therefore, the search for developing a relatively high-performance but cadmium-free CuInS2 QD-sensitized solar cell has become increasingly important and urgent for environmental issues.
Here, we describe QD-sensitized solar cells consisting of a CuInS2 sensitizer with a buffer layer (Cu2S) and a passivation layer (ZnSe), fabricated by using the successive ionic-layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process. A schematic diagram of the Cu2S–CuInS2–ZnSe QD-sensitized solar cell with cascaded energy gap structures that benefit from the separation of excited electrons and holes across the interfacial region is presented in Fig. 1. TiO2 films were prepared by screen printing of a TiO2 slurry on FTO glass. As a buffer layer, Cu2S with a bulk band gap of 1.2 eV13 was deposited on the TiO2 film before the deposition of CuInS2 to improve the unmatched band alignments between TiO2 and CuInS2 and to reduce the density of electron trap states at the TiO2 surface. By using the SILAR process, a thin layer of CuInS2 QDs was uniformly coated on the surface of the Cu2S to act as a light absorber. Subsequently, the CuInS2 surface was passivated with a wider band gap semiconductor (ZnSe, 2.7 eV)14 to prevent the leakage of current from QDs to the electrolyte. Additionally, as the lattice constants of ZnSe and CuInS2 are closely matched, the interface created between the two will have minimal lattice mismatch (∼2%) between the merging lattices, thus helping to relieve the interfacial strain and consequently reducing the amount of interfacial defects.15,16 Under illumination, a CuInS2 QD absorbs a photon and an electron is excited from a valence band to a conduction band. This is followed by electron injection to the TiO2 conduction band, after which the photogenerated holes in CuInS2 QDs will be scavenged by sulfide/polysulfide (S2−/Sx2−) electrolytes.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of a Cu2S–CuInS2–ZnSe QD-sensitized solar cell with relative positions of band gap edges. 
Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the absorption spectra of the transparent TiO2 films coated repeatedly by the precursor solutions of CuInS2. With each SILAR cycle, the absorption edge shifted to a longer wavelength and the absorption amplitude gradually increased as the number of deposition cycles increased, indicating an increased adsorption amount of CuInS2. The photovoltaic performance was measured under the illumination of a solar simulator at one sun (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the CuInS2 QD-sensitized solar cell with various SILAR cycles are tabulated in Table S1 (ESI†). Initially, excited electron injection from the CuInS2 QDs into the TiO2 electrode was enhanced upon increasing the number of SILAR cycles, leading to higher JSC while retaining nearly the same VOC (Fig. S2, ESI†). As the thickness of CuInS2 increases from two to seven SILAR cycles, the internal resistance and FF would be expected to increase and decrease, respectively. The JSC increased by about 270% from two to six SILAR cycles of CuInS2, thus yielding about a 200% increase in overall efficiency (Table S1, ESI†). In a control experiment, the photovoltaic efficiency decreased dramatically in the absence of the Cu2S buffer layer, from 0.90% for the Cu2S–CuInS2(6) configuration to 0.52% for the CuInS2(6) sample (denoted as CuInS2(n) after n cycles of CuInS2 deposition). This indicates that the Cu2S buffer layer plays an important role in improving photovoltaic efficiency. These results may be attributed to the significant improvement in the unmatched band alignments between TiO2 and CuInS2, which suppresses the back flow of electrons if a buffer layer is deposited prior to CuInS2 deposition.10,17–19 Similar performance enhancement of a photovoltaic device has been reported previously for chalcopyrite solar cells, in which a buffer layer such as In2Se320 or CdS10 is typically required between the I–III–VI group and TiO2 regions to control the interfacial properties. Conversion enhancement can be achieved by blocking the electron back flow and by lowering the interfacial recombination.
Among wide-gap semiconductors, zinc chalcogenide is a direct wide band gap compound semiconductor with a bulk band gap of 1.21–3.7 eV. ZnSe was chosen as the passivation layer in CuInS2 QD-sensitized solar cells because the bulk band gap difference between ZnSe (about 2.7 eV)14 and CuInS2 (about 1.5 eV) is small. Another possible advantage of CuInS2 surface passivation with a ZnSe, as opposed to a ZnS passivation layer, lies in the photogenerated holes in CuInS2 QDs being effectively scavenged by sulfide/polysulfide (S2−/Sx2−) electrolytes, which can also tackle issues related to anodic photocorrosion.21,22 Chakrapani et al.22 have indicated that CdSe1−xSx will be generated on the top of CdSe servers as an overcoated layer in the presence of sulfide/polysulfide (S2−/Sx2−) electrolytes. Similarly, the substitution reaction at the interface between ZnSe and sulfide/polysulfide (S2−/Sx2−) electrolytes also forms a ZnSe1−xSx interface, offering a medium band gap and thus providing cascade band structures advantageous in the separation of excited electrons and holes across the interfacial region. As shown in Fig. 2, the values of JSC, VOC, and FF for the photoelectrodes with the ZnSe passivation layer increase. Both the JSC (10.96 mA cm−2) and VOC (604.9 mV) values of the Cu2S–CuInS2(6)–ZnSe(3)-based cell are significantly higher than those (6.57 mA cm−2 and 529.9 mV) of Cu2S–CuInS2(6), which results in the power conversion efficiency of the former (0.90%) being ∼3 times higher than the latter (2.52%). A sample after n cycles of CuInS2 QDs and m cycles of ZnSe deposition was denoted as Cu2S–CuInS2(n)–ZnSe(m). As the number of ZnSe passivation layers increases, JSC, VOC, and FF increase and show maximum values with three ZnSe passivation layers (Fig. S3, ESI†). The enhancement of JSC and η in the Cu2S–CuInS2(6)–ZnSe(3) cell implies that this configuration has superior ability compared to Cu2S–CuInS2(6) in inhibiting the charge recombination at the electrode–electrolyte interface. The higher value of VOC in the Cu2S–CuInS2(6)–ZnSe(3) configuration was due to the greater band gap (2.7 eV) of ZnSe QDs relative to that of CuInS2 QDs. The FF of Cu2S–CuInS2(6)–ZnSe(3) is larger than that of Cu2S–CuInS2(6), indicating a good ability to improve hole transfer from CuInS2 to the ZnSe passivation layer because of the cascade band structures. XPS was further performed to examine the chemical state of the Cu2S–CuInS2–ZnSe configuration (Fig. S4, ESI†). The results show that the chemical states of the sample are Cu+, In3+, S2+, Zn2+, and Se2+ for the Cu2S–CuInS2–ZnSe QDs-sensitized solar cell.

ZnS, another candidate wide band gap semiconductor, is one of the most widely used surface passivation layer for CdSe or CdS QDs to enhance the performance of QD-sensitized solar cells.23,24 However, CuInS2 has a smaller band gap of 1.5 eV, which is lower than the 1.7 eV of CdSe21 or 2.6 eV of CdS.25 Both conduction and valence band edges of CuInS2 are located within the energy gap of ZnS (3.7 eV),14 whose higher conduction edge compared to CuInS2 QDs prevents the leakage of current from the QDs to the electrolyte. However, the wider offsets of the valence band between ZnS and CuInS2 also create a barrier for the hole scavenging form in CuInS2 QDs. To confirm this, we performed a control experiment in the presence of the ZnS passivation layer (Table 1 and Table S2 (ESI†)), which revealed that the ZnS-absorbed electrode exhibited a value of η that first increased and then decreased after reaching a maximum value of 1.33% when ZnS was deposited twice (Fig. S3, ESI†).

The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices for the Cu2S–CuInS2(6) cover nearly the entire visible and near-infrared spectral range from 400 to 1000 nm (Fig. 3). At longer wavelengths, a distinctive excitonic feature indicating the contribution of small-sized CuInS2 QDs can be resolved clearly. The broad IPCE curves exhibit a maximum of 50%, 39%, and 32% at 500–520 nm for Cu2S–CuInS2(6), Cu2S–CuInS2(6)–ZnS(2), and Cu2S–CuInS2(6)–ZnSe(3), respectively. This result indicates that the ZnSe passivation layer is more efficient than CuInS2, either in the presence or absence of a ZnS passivation layer in improving charge separation and charge collection at the interface between the TiO2 films and the CuInS2 sensitizers. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the Nyquist curves of the electrochemical impedance spectra results containing two semicircles in the middle-frequency region (10–100 Hz) and low-frequency region (0.1–1 Hz), respectively. The semicircle in the high-frequency region (>1 kHz) corresponding to the Nernst diffusion is absent due to the relatively fast diffusion of the electrolyte in the TiO2 film. This indicates a lower resistance of electron transfer at the TiO2–QDs–electrolyte because of the ZnSe passivation layer, reflecting acceleration of the electron transfer process in the film photoanode. This result further confirms that the introduction of a ZnSe passivation layer onto the surface of Cu2S–CuInS2(6) favors electron transfer from CuInS2 QDs to TiO2.

In summary, we developed a “greener” QD-sensitized solar cell based on the Cu2S–CuInS2–ZnSe configuration, with the advantages of efficient photovoltaic performance, less hazardous precursors, and environmental friendliness. The band edges of the Cu2S–CuInS2–ZnSe in the QD-sensitized solar cell generate a stepwise cascade, which promotes the separation of excited electrons and holes across the interfacial region. The best device, obtained with the Cu2S–CuInS2(6)–ZnSe(3) configuration, showed JSC, VOC, FF, and η values that reached 10.96 mA cm−2, 604.9 mV, 40.6%, and 2.52%, respectively. The device shows a five-fold enhancement of efficiency compared to a CuInS2 QD-sensitized solar cell.
