    , Accepted 2nd September 2022First published on 6th September 2022AbstractSolar-driven desalination by using porous evaporators has been deemed to be a sustainable pathway to obtain freshwater. Despite the emerging anti-scaling evaporators, the durable evaporation in hypersaline water remains a formidable challenge because of the unpreventable salt accumulation in the porous structures. To enhance the descaling capacity of evaporators, a self-descaling Janus evaporator (SJE) featuring a “moving interface” is developed for durable and efficient desalination of hypersaline water. This evaporator consists of an Fe3O4-embedded poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) nanofibrous layer and a hydrophilic polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibrous layer constrcuted by sequential electrospinning. Integrating the photothermal conversion of Fe3O4 and the thermal responsiveness of PNIPAM, the SJE exhibits a reversible solar-induced wettability transition from asymmetric wettability (under sunlight) to hydrophilic wettability (at night). Under sunlight, the top surface and the evaporation interface (i.e. air–water interface) are separated to prevent salt accumulation on the evaporator, benefiting efficient solar steam generation. At night, the air–water interface moves to the upper surface, showing the self-descaling ability. With this design, the SJE exhibits a high-efficiency water evaporation rate of 1.76 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun and demonstrates long-term stability (over 5 days) when treating 20 wt% NaCl solution. Overall, this work provides an exciting material solution with photothermal responsive design for the practical application of Janus evaporators in brine desalination.
1. Introduction
The ever-growing population and rapid industrialization increase the demand for fresh water, and climate change further exacerbates water stress worldwide.1,2 Desalination techniques such as reverse osmosis and flash distillation have been developed to alleviate the water shortage over the past few decades. Considering the huge energy consumption in desalination facilities, desalination technologies utilizing solar energy for sustainable freshwater production have been widely investigated, including solar reverse osmosis, solar-driven electrochemical desalination and solar-thermal interface desalination.3 Solar reverse osmosis combines solar photovoltaic cells to supply energy for reverse osmosis, which requires high-cost photovoltaic cells and storage equipment.4 In the solar-driven electrochemical desalination process, a photovoltaic electrode converts solar energy into electrical energy and drives the electrochemical system to remove salts from the feed solution through physical adsorption or a chemical reaction.5–10 By contrast, solar-driven desalination enabled by photothermal materials has recently been attracting increasing interest due to the direct and high-efficiency conversion of solar energy.11–13 During solar-driven evaporation, the problem of scaling remains the major challenge to the service life of evaporators.14–18 The salt accumulation on the surface or/and in the channels of evaporators not only cuts off the water supply for evaporation, but also reduces the light absorption by covering the photothermal surface. Several anti-scaling designs have been proposed to address this issue over the past few years.19–26 For example, some research groups reduced the local salt concentration by applying large and low-tortuous channels to enhance the mass transfer. However, heat also transfers with the saline solution, compromising the evaporation performance of evaporators.19–21 Moreover, some researchers used polyelectrolyte hydrogels to supply water, and the salts were kept at a low concentration based on size screening and the Donnan effect. Unfortunately, the charged hydrogels not only block the ions but also impede the water transport, resulting in an insufficient evaporation efficiency of nearly 80%.22–24
Recently, Janus evaporators (JEs) with asymmetric wettability have been also proposed to prevent the salt scaling on the surfaces.25–28 In general, JEs are composed of a hydrophobic top layer and a hydrophilic bottom layer. Compared with the conventional hydrophilic evaporators, the evaporation interface of JEs moves from the top surface to the interface between the hydrophilic layer and the hydrophobic layer, preventing salt accumulation on the top surface. On the other hand, the heat transfer distance is greatly shortened in contrast to the hydrophobic evaporator with the same thickness, ensuring a high evaporation rate.29–32 However, JEs can only prevent the salt accumulation on the top surface rather than eradicating the scaling problem of solar-driven desalination. The brine at the air–water interface is gradually concentrated during evaporation, resulting in the inevitable crystallization of salts at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface inside JEs.19 It is difficult to remove these salts by rinsing due to the mass transfer resistance from the porous structures. As a result, the accumulated salts may block the water transport channels or even puncture through the hydrophobic layer and precipitate onto the top surface over time, compromising the long-term performance of the evaporators (Scheme 1a).32
 Scheme 1  Schematics of a (a) traditional JE and (b) SJE for solar-driven desalination. The SJE consists of a PNIPAM/Fe3O4 nanofibrous layer and a hydrophilic PAN nanofibrous layer. Such an evaporator shows Janus wettability under sunlight, because PNIPAM is a well-known thermally sensitive polymer which shows a lower critical solution temperature (LCST). This structure separates the air–water interface from the top surface to prevent salt accumulation, benefiting the efficient solar steam generation. At night, the SJE becomes hydrophilic. Therefore, the air–water interface moves to the top surface, and the whole evaporator is washed with water, showing self-descaling ability. 
To address this issue, a self-descaling Janus evaporator (SJE) with a “moving air–water interface” is proposed in the current work for durable solar desalination. The SJE is constructed from a thermo-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) nanofibrous layer embedded with Fe3O4 nanoparticles and a hydrophilic polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibrous layer via sequential electrospinning. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles serve as the photothermal agent in the upper layer, and the PNIPAM nanofibers perform a reverse hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic transition at the lower critical solution temperature (LCST).33–35 In the daytime, the SJE shows asymmetric wettability similar to the conventional JEs with an evaporation/scaling interface in the evaporators, preventing the salt accumulation on the top surface. At night, the SJE becomes completely hydrophilic, enabling rinsing over the whole evaporator (Scheme 1b). It can be assembled with a water-absorbing layer and thermo-insulating foam into a practical device showing an outstanding water evaporation rate of 1.76 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun irradiation. Moreover, the SJE displays good durability for the 20 wt% NaCl feed. No salt accumulation is left on the top surface of the SJE after continuously operating for 5 days with an evaporation rate drop of less than 4%. In addition, it can be easily scaled up from lab-scale fabrication to large-scale manufacture. Consequently, this work on designing an evaporator with photothermal responsive wettability offers an exhilarating opportunity to pursue durable and efficient solar-thermal desalination of brine in practical application.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Fabrication and solar-induced wettability transition of the SJE
As shown in Fig. 1a and b, a large-area SJE (15 cm × 20 cm) can be easily constructed by sequentially electrospinning a hydrophilic layer and a switchable photothermal layer (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The photothermal layer was fabricated by electrospinning PNIPAM/Fe3O4 nanofibers followed by thermo-crosslinking (Fig. S2 in the ESI†).36 After heat treatment, the appearance of the OC–N–C(C) peak confirms the formation of cross-linked PNIPAM, and 3.6% of the repeating units of PNIPAM participated in the cross-linking reaction (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The cross-linked PNIPAM nanofibers show enhanced mechanical strength and cannot be dissolved in water (Fig. S4 in the ESI†). Fe3O4 nanoparticles serve as the photothermal agent in this research. Considering the light absorbance, photothermal conversion and fiber morphology, the PNIPAM/Fe3O4 nanofibers with 15 wt% Fe3O4 content were selected to fabricate the evaporator (Fig. S5 and S6 in the ESI†). Subsequently, PAN nanofibers were directly electrospun onto the cured PNIPAM/Fe3O4 nanofiber layer to form the SJE. The nanofibers are randomly oriented with distinguished morphologies on each surface (Fig. S7 in the ESI†). The PNIPAM/Fe3O4 nanofibers have a rough fiber surface, while the surface of PAN nanofibers is relatively smooth (Fig. S8 in the ESI†). The micro-structured roughness of PNIPAM/Fe3O4 nanofibers can enhance the multi-scattering of the incident light, which is beneficial to improve the light absorption of the SJE. On the other hand, the average diameter is 1.2 ± 0.3 μm for PNIPAM/Fe3O4 nanofibers, while 0.6 ± 0.1 μm for PAN ones. Moreover, the detected porosity of the prepared SJE is 85.21%, which is beneficial for water transport, salt diffusion and vapor escape in the membrane.

Fe3O4 nanoparticles are widely used as a photothermal agent, and PNIPAM is an outstanding thermally responsive polymer. Fig. 1c demonstrates that the PNIPAM/Fe3O4 layer exhibits a broad and high absorption from ultraviolet to near-infrared regions, covering the whole spectrum of sunlight. For convenience, we denote SJEs with a PNIPAM/Fe3O4 layer of X μm and a PAN layer of Y μm as SJE-X/Y. The light absorption increases with the thickness of the PNIPAM/Fe3O4 layer (Fig. S9 and in the ESI†). Nearly 94.8% absorption is achieved when the thickness of PNIPAM/Fe3O4 layer reaches 265 ± 17 μm, and the surface temperature is increased to 76.7 ± 1.8 °C under one-sun irradiation (Fig. 1d and S11 in the ESI†). During the temperature increase, the SJE surface experiences a hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic transition. As shown in Fig. 1e, the temperature of the PNIPAM/Fe3O4 surface is 75.1 °C under 1 sun irradiation, and the corresponding water contact angle (WCA) is nearly 114°. When the temperature drops to room temperature (∼27.2 °C) after turning off the light source, the water droplet spreads rapidly on the SJE surface with a WCA of below 10°. The wettability transition occurs at a narrow temperature interval (30 °C to 40 °C), which is consistent with the LCST of PNIPAM reported in the literature (∼32 °C) (Fig. S12 in the ESI†).37–40 Under sunlight, Fe3O4 nanoparticles absorb solar irradiation and heat PNIPAM to a temperature above the LCST, resulting in the transition of PNIPAM from the hydrophilic state to the hydrophobic state (Fig. S13 in the ESI†). The natural sunlight intensity will be affected by the weather in the real world. Therefore, we monitored the temperature elevation under different light intensities to simulate real conditions (Fig. S14 in the ESI†). The surface temperature of the PNIPAM/Fe3O4 layer can reach 57.5 ± 1.6 °C under 500 W m−2 (0.5 sun), which is still above the LCST. Therefore, the PNIPAM/Fe3O4 surface of the SJE can still show reversible wettability even under weak light irradiation. Moreover, the PNIPAM/Fe3O4 layer shows reversible wettability and stable WCAs during 100 light-on/light–off cycles (Fig. 1f and Table S1 in the ESI†). Benefiting from the stable cross-linking structure, the morphology of nanofibers shows nearly no changes after the cycles (Fig. S15 in the ESI†). By contrast, the PAN nanofiber layer remains hydrophilic across the whole temperature range (Fig. S16 in the ESI†). As a result, our SJE shows asymmetric wettability under the sunlight, while becoming completely hydrophilic in the dark.
2.2. Solar evaporation performance under sunlight and self-descaling properties at night
Under the sunlight, the as-prepared SJE shows a superior evaporation rate with asymmetric wettability. We investigated the influences of the thickness and the hydrophobic/hydrophilic ratio of fibrous layers on water evaporation performance (Fig. 2a and b). The experiments were conducted on a thermally insulated device floated on the water surface under 1 sun irradiation (Fig. 2c and S17 in the ESI†).

(f) Pure water evaporation rate and corresponding efficiency as a function of the PAN layer thickness in SJE under 1 sun irradiation. (g) Schematic diagram of influence of different thicknesses of the PAN layer on the water supply and the heat dissipation of the SJE. 
For JEs, the top hydrophobic layer is unwetted for vapor transport. The light absorption as well as the vapor transport resistance increases with the thickness of the PNIPAM/Fe3O4 layer (Fig. 2a). As a result, the evaporation rate increases with the thickness of the PNIPAM/Fe3O4 layer at the initial stage and achieves the maximum value of 1.76 ± 0.04 kg m−2 h−1 with a corresponding evaporation efficiency of 92.4 ± 2.1% at 265 ± 17 μm in our experiment. These results are attributed to the significantly increased light absorption as well as the photothermal effect with the increased thickness of the PNIPAM/Fe3O4 layer (Fig. S10 in the ESI†). Further increasing the thickness of the PNIPAM/Fe3O4 layer leads to a decrease of the evaporation rate because the light absorption cannot be further promoted, but the vapor transport resistance increases (Fig. 2e, S18 and S19 in the ESI†). These results demonstrate that the optimal thickness is 265 ± 17 μm for the PNIPAM/Fe3O4 layer in our SJE.
On the other hand, the bottom hydrophilic layer plays a critical role in water supply that also affects the evaporation performance. If the PAN layer is too thin, the water supply is insufficient at the evaporation interface, compromising the evaporation rate. If the PAN layer is too thick, the increased heat loss reduces the overall evaporation efficiency because of the heat conduction from the surface to the bulk water reserved in the PAN layer (Fig. 2b and Fig. S9 in the ESI†). As a result, the evaporation rate gradually increases from 1.21 ± 0.02 kg m−2 h−1 to 1.76 ± 0.04 kg m−2 h−1 with the increase of the PAN layer thickness (Fig. 2f, S18 and S19 in the ESI†). When the thickness of the PAN layer is further increased to 58 ± 6 μm, the evaporation rate begins to decrease due to the enhanced heat dissipation (Fig. 2b and g). Therefore, the optimal PAN layer thickness is 58 ± 6 μm. Combining with the above results, we selected SJE-265/58 with excellent evaporation performance for further investigations.
During the solar-driven evaporation, the salt scaling remains the major challenge for its practical application. It is very interesting that the as-prepared SJE with solar-induced switchable wettability is able to spontaneously clean off the salt scale using the rest time at night. As shown in Fig. 3a, the CuSO4 powder on the top surface of the SJE is white under light but turns to blue CuSO4·5H2O in the dark. This is because the evaporator becomes completely hydrophilic, and the air–water interface moves to the top surface without solar irradiation (Fig. 3b). Subsequently, the salts completely dissolve within 60 min. These self-descaling properties can be attributed to continuous freshwater flow pumped by the PAN hydrophilic layer, which facilitates the diffusion of salt to bulk water. To further evaluate the self-descaling ability of the SJE, 1.5 g NaCl salt was placed on a circular evaporator with a diameter of 4 cm, and the salts completely dissolved within only 3 h (Fig. S20 in the ESI†). The study reveals that SJEs possess a moveable air–water interface, showing excellent self-descaling ability at night.

2.3. Durable desalination performance of the SJE in brine
Durable and rapid solar evaporation is challenging for brine because the evaporators are prone to scaling with high salinity. The switchable wettability enables our SJE to evaporate the brine efficiently in daytime while it has to be rinsed at night. Herein, we compared the cycled evaporation performance in 20 wt% NaCl solution of the fibrous evaporators with different wettability forms (i.e., hydrophobic evaporators, hydrophilic evaporators, traditional JEs and our SJE). The salt accumulation and dissolution were monitored as presented in Fig. 4a–d.
 Fig. 4  Durable evaporation performance of the SJE. (a and d) Photographs and schematic diagram showing salt accumulation and descaling properties of hydrophobic evaporators, hydrophilic evaporators, traditional JEs and our SJE. (e) Evaporation rate–time curves of hydrophobic evaporators, hydrophilic evaporators, traditional JEs and SJE in 20 wt% NaCl solution with simulated day–night cycles. During the daytime, the power intensity of artificial sunlight is 1000 W m−2. 
For the hydrophobic one, salt crystals cannot be observed on the top surface because the evaporation interface is located at the bottom surface of the evaporator (Fig. 4a). However, since the photothermal surface is totally separated from the evaporation interface, the poor heat transfer and high vapor transport resistance lead to a relatively low evaporation rate of ∼0.80 kg m−2 h−1 (Fig. 4e), while for the hydrophilic counterpart, salts gradually precipitate on the top surface and eventually cover the whole evaporator during the daytime evaporation (Fig. 4b). The covered salt scaling will diminish the light absorption and thereby reduce the evaporation rate. Therefore, the evaporation rates sharply drop from 1.40 kg m−2 h−1 to 1.06 kg m−2 h−1, decreasing by 24.2% after 9 h operation (Fig. 4e).
The traditional JEs exhibit a competitive evaporation rate (1.33 kg m−2 h−1) and prevent the salt scaling on the top surface. Unfortunately, after several evaporation cycles, some salts appear on the evaporator surface because the salt grains in the channels invade the top surface due to the inevitable saturation of the ion concentration during long-term desalination (Fig. 4c). Moreover, these salt crystals cannot completely re-dissolve in water at night because the hydrophobic layer isolates the salts from the water. After five days, the evaporator is ultimately covered with the salt scaling, and the corresponding evaporation rate decreases by nearly 14.2% (Fig. 4e).
The SJE performs solar-induced wettability transition and reversible movement of the air–water interface. During the daytime, the evaporator shows a high evaporation rate and excellent salt resistance similar to the traditional JEs (Fig. 4d). At night, the SJE becomes completely hydrophilic so that the air–water interface is elevated to the top surface for sufficient rinsing of the accumulated salts in the channels or on the evaporator surface. As a result, the evaporation rate experiences a negligible decrease from 1.35 kg m−2 h−1 to 1.32 kg m−2 h−1 after five days, maintaining above 96% of the initial value (Fig. 4e). All these results indicate that our SJE is promising in durable desalination, in particular for the brine with high salinity.
We systematically evaluated the desalination performance of the optimized SJE. The saline feeds with different NaCl concentrations (3.5, 10.0, 15.0 and 25.0 wt%) were evaporated, and the corresponding evaporation rates decline with increasing NaCl concentration from 1.71 ± 0.08 kg m−2 h−1 (3.5 wt%) to 1.44 ± 0.09 kg m−2 h−1 (25.0 wt%) (Fig. 5a). These results can be explained as the higher salt concentration reduces the saturated vapor pressure of water at the air–water interface, which inhibits the generation of water vapor and leads to a lower evaporation rate.41 The conductivities of the collected condensed water are all below 15 μS cm−1 and decrease by 99.99% compared with the original brine solutions (Table S2 in the ESI†). Moreover, increasing the solar intensity leads to the increase of the evaporation rate to 2.52 ± 0.30 kg m-2 h−1 under 1.5 suns and further to 3.34 ± 0.32 kg m−2 h−1 under 2.0 suns. The solar vapor efficiency also increases to 93.8 ± 1.17% (1.5 suns) and 96.1 ± 1.3% (2.0 suns) (Fig. S21 in the ESI†). Fig. 5b summarizes the evaporation performance of solar evaporators reported in recent reports. The SJE shows a competitive evaporation rate of NaCl solutions with various salt concentrations (Table S3 in the ESI†).

(d) Concentrations of major ions in the artificial seawater and collected condensed water. 
We further desalinated artificial seawater using the large-area SJE under natural sunlight to prove the feasibility for seawater desalination (Fig. 5c). Such a device can produce condensed water with a rate of 4.47 kg m−2 over a whole day (8:00–18:00) (Fig. S22 in the ESI†). The concentrations of major ions (La+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and K+) in the condensed water are all below 1.0 ppm, meeting the purity requirement of the World Health Organization (WHO) for potable water (Fig. 5d).
3. Conclusions
In summary, we have prepared a self-descaling evaporator with a moving air–water interface for durable photothermal desalination. The prepared SJE consists of a crosslinked PNIPAM/Fe3O4 nanofibrous layer and a hydrophilic PAN nanofibrous layer. The PNIPAM/Fe3O4 layer combines the photothermal effect of Fe3O4 and the thermal sensitivity of PNIPAM, showing solar-induced switchable wettability from hydrophobic under sunlight to hydrophilic under lightless conditions. Under sunlight, the evaporator shows Janus wettability, and the air–water interface is detached from the light-absorbing interface. Such an evaporator possesses an efficient evaporation rate of 1.76 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun irradiation and prevents salt scaling on the top surface. Under lightless conditions, the evaporator becomes hydrophilic, and the air–water interface moves to the top surface. The whole evaporator is rinsed with water, showing self-descaling properties. This SJE can maintain 96% of the initial evaporation rate even after continuously operating in 20 wt% NaCl solution for 5 days, showing great stability in long-term service. Moreover, it can be easily scaled up via sequential electrospinning, bridging the gap between lab-scale fabrication and large-scale manufacture. Conceivably, the newly developed SJE integrates efficient evaporation and self-descaling ability, which may offer possibilities for durable and efficient solar-thermal desalination of brine in practical application.

PVDF powder (Mn = 500000 Da, FR904) was supplied by Shanghai 3F New Materials Co., Ltd (China), and PNIPAM (Mn = 300000 Da) was bought from Shanghai Rhawn Chemical Technology Co., Ltd (China). Tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris base), iron(II,III) oxide (Fe3O4 powder, 50–100 nm), and dopamine hydrochloride (98%) were commercially produced by Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Trimethoxy[3-(oxiranylmethoxy)propyl]-silane hydrolyzed (POSS), carbon black (CB, xc∼72R), and PAN powder (Mn = 250000 Da) were acquired from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd (China). 2-Ethyl-4-methylimidazole (EMI), methyl orange, direct red 80 and methylene blue were obtained from Aladdin Chemical Co., Ltd (China). N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%), tetrahydrofuran (THF), methanol and copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O) were commercial products of Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China). Deionized water was home-made using an ELGA LabWater system (France).
4.2. Preparation of polymer solutions
Before electrospinning experiments, several polymer solutions were prepared. PNIPAM/Fe3O4 solution was composed of PVDF (1.2 g), PNIPAM (0.3 g), POSS (cross-linking agent, 45.0 mg), EMI (catalyst, 0.9 mg), Fe3O4 powder (1.5 g), DMF (7.1 mL) and THF (3.1 mL); PAN solution was prepared by dissolving PAN (1.0 g) in DMF (9.5 mL); PVDF solution consisted of PVDF powder (1.0 g) and DMF (6.0 mL); PVDF/Fe3O4 solution was prepared by adding Fe3O4 powder into the as-prepared PVDF solution. The above-mentioned solutions were stirred at 75 °C overnight.
4.3. Fabrication of the SJE and other evaporators
The SJE was fabricated in an enclosed room with a room temperature of 25 °C, and the relative humidity was set at 50%. First, the PNIPAM/Fe3O4 solution was electrospun on a flat collector to fabricate the PNIPAM/Fe3O4 nanofiber layer (applied voltage: 7.5 kV; feeding rate: 1.0 mL h−1). Then, the PNIPAM/Fe3O4 nanofibers were cross-linked by heating in a vacuum at 160 °C for 4 h. During the heat treatment, the reactions between H–N (from the NIPAM unit) and the epoxide group (from POSS) were catalyzed by a strong base (EMI), forming the cross-linked network of PNIPAM (Fig. S2†). Finally, the PAN solution was electrospun on the cured PNIPAM/Fe3O4 nanofiber layer to form the SJE (applied voltage: 12.5 kV; feeding rate: 0.5 mL h−1). The thicknesses of the PNIPAM/Fe3O4 nanofiber layer and PAN nanofiber layer were controlled by changing the corresponding electrospinning time.
Traditional JEs were fabricated similarly. First, the prepared PVDF/Fe3O4 solution was electrospun on a flat collector to fabricate the PVDF/Fe3O4 nanofiber layer (applied voltage: 7.5 kV; feeding rate: 1.0 mL h−1). Then, the PAN solution was electrospun on the PVDF/Fe3O4 nanofiber layer to fabricate traditional JEs (applied voltage: 12.5 kV; feeding rate: 0.5 mL h−1).
Hydrophilic evaporators were prepared by modifying the traditional JEs with PDA. The modification process was triggered by CuSO4 and H2O2, and the preparation procedure of the deposition solution can be found in the previous work.42 The as-prepared JEs were prewetted with ethanol and then dipped into the deposition solutions for 60 min at ambient temperature. After deposition, the modified membrane was taken out and then rinsed with pure water overnight.
Hydrophobic evaporators were fabricated via electrospinning and a spraying process. First, PVDF solution was electrospun on a flat collector to fabricate the PVDF nanofiber layer (applied voltage: 8.5 kV; feeding rate: 1.0 mL h−1). A CB/methanol (0.1 mg mL−1) mixed solution was then uniformly sprayed onto the upper surface of the prepared membrane to form hydrophobic evaporators. All of the prepared evaporators were dried overnight in a vacuum at 60 °C before further characterization.
4.4. Evaluation of solar-driven switchable wettability of the SJE
The PNIPAM/Fe3O4 surface was exposed to a simulated sunlight system (1000 W m−2, xenon lamp, Changzhou Hongming Instrument Technology Co., Ltd, China) equipped with an AM 1.5G filter. A drop of water (3.0 μL) was released on the PNIPAM/Fe3O4 surface, and then the irradiation source was turned off. Meanwhile, the dynamic water contact angle and surface temperature were recorded by using an Optical Surface Analyzer-100 system (Ningbo NB Scientific Instruments Co., Ltd, China) and an IR imaging device (FLIR ONE PRO, FLIR Systems Inc., USA), respectively.
4.5. Measurement of solar-driven evaporation performance
The indoor evaporation devices were composed of a glass beaker and circular polystyrene foam with a diameter of 4.5 cm. The foams were covered with absorbent paper. A circular evaporator with a diameter of 4 cm was placed on the absorbent paper and exposed to a simulated 1 sun irradiation (xenon lamp, Changzhou Hongming Instrument Technology Co., Ltd, China equipped with an AM 1.5G filter). The indoor evaporation experiments were performed in an enclosed room with a room temperature of 25 ± 2 °C and a relative humidity of 45 ± 10%. The mass change during experiments was recorded using a FA2004N electronic balance (JingHai, China), and evaporator temperature was measured with an IR imaging device (FLIR ONE PRO, FLIR Systems Inc., USA). In evaporation experiments, the rate of mass change increases slightly with time and reaches a steady state after 40 min. The evaporation rate at the steady state is denoted as ERevaporator, which was calculated as follows: (1)where Δm denotes the constant mass change data, ERfoam is the evaporation rate of foam under 1 sun, Δt is the evaporation time, Sfoam and Sevaporator are the surface area of the foam and evaporator, respectively.
The evaporation efficiency (η) of the evaporators was calculated by using eqn (2): (2)where q is the input sunlight intensity, ERevaporator in dark is the dark evaporation rate of evaporators and h is the evaporation enthalpy of liquid water (≈2260 kJ kg−1).
The outdoor evaporations were carried out on the lawn of Yuquan Campus, Zhejiang University. Artificial seawater was used as the feed solution, and condensed water was collected. The concentrations of major ions in the condensed water were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Varian 730-ES, USA). For the desalination of NaCl brine, the salt rejection was calculated by using eqn (3): (3)where Ccondensed is the conductivity of the condensed water, and Cfeed is the conductivity of the brine solution. The conductivities of the brine solutions and the condensed water were determined with an FE30 conductivity meter (Mettler Toledo, China). To evaluate the reusability of evaporators, the evaporations were performed in the 20 wt% NaCl solution for five days, and the evaporation rate–time curve of the evaporators was measured. In the simulated daytime, the evaporator equipped with the thermally insulated foam was placed in 20% NaCl solution under 1-sun irradiation for 9 h. At the simulated night, the composite device was taken out and then floated on the pure water for 3 h without light irradiation. Moreover, the photographs of the evaporators during the experiment processes were recorded with a camera.
4.6. Other characterization studies
The surface morphologies of electrospun nanofibers were recorded by FE-SEM (S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) and TEM (HT-7700, Hitachi, Japan). Then, the fiber diameter distribution of the nanofibrous layer was obtained by software analysis (Image J). The chemical compositions of the electrospun nanofibers were evaluated by XPS. The porosity of the prepared membranes was measured with a mercury porosimeter (AutoPore IV 9510, USA). The tensile elongation curves of nanofibrous evaporators were measured using a microcomputer controlled electronic universal testing machine (RTW10, Shenzhen Reger Instrument Co. Ltd, China) with a crosshead speed of 1 mm min−1. The full-wave band transmission (T) and reflection spectra (R) were measured by using a spectrophotometer (UH4150, HITACHI, Japan), and the light absorptions (A) of the photothermal surface of evaporators were calculated using eqn (4): A = (1 − R − T) × 100%(4)
The dynamic contact angles at different temperatures were measured by using an Optical Surface Analyzer-100 system (Ningbo NB Scientific Instruments Co., Ltd, China) combined with a hot stage accessory.

 	Scheme 1  Schematics of a (a) traditional JE and (b) SJE for solar-driven desalination. The SJE consists of a PNIPAM/Fe3O4 nanofibrous layer and a hydrophilic PAN nanofibrous layer. Such an evaporator shows Janus wettability under sunlight, because PNIPAM is a well-known thermally sensitive polymer which shows a lower critical solution temperature (LCST). This structure separates the air–water interface from the top surface to prevent salt accumulation, benefiting the efficient solar steam generation. At night, the SJE becomes hydrophilic. Therefore, the air–water interface moves to the top surface, and the whole evaporator is washed with water, showing self-descaling ability.
