    , Accepted 29th August 2015First published on 2nd September 2015AbstractConverting solar energy into hydrogen via photoelectrochemical water splitting has attracted significant attention during the past decades. Herein, we design a novel core/shell TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode in combination with a CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskite solar cell for unassisted solar water splitting. Compared to pristine TiO2 NRs, the resulting TiO2@BiVO4 film exhibits a 3.25-fold enhanced photocurrent density (∼1.3 mA cm−2) under irradiation (xenon lamp coupled with an AM 1.5 G filter, 100 mW cm−2). This significant enhancement is attributed to the excellent light absorption properties of BiVO4 and a fast electron transfer process in the single crystalline TiO2 NRs. Especially, the type-II band alignment between the BiVO4 and rutile TiO2 NRs provides a large driving force for electron injection from the BiVO4 to the TiO2. The perovskite solar cell-TiO2@BiVO4 photoelectrochemical tandem device exhibits an overall solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 1.24%, comparable to other TiO2-based PV/PEC systems.
Introduction
Solar energy, the abundant renewable source of energy, can be converted into storable and friendly environmental energy in the form of hydrogen through photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting.1,2 The conventional PEC water splitting with a single photo-electrode configuration occurs in the form of a half reaction. However, the efficient unbiased solar water splitting remains elusive due to the rigorous thermodynamic requirements (1.23 V at standard temperature and pressure) and the associated over-potential to drive water oxidation and reduction.3,4 Unassisted solar water splitting can be achieved with a tandem PEC system consisting of a photovoltaic/photoelectrode (PV/PEC) device or photoanode/photocathode design.5 In such a system, the photoelectrodes or PV cells with different absorption abilities can address a broad part of the solar spectrum and deliver a high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency for water splitting. For example, Turner et al. first reported a high STH efficiency of 12.4% using a monolithic PV/PEC device for overall solar water splitting consisting of a p-GaInP2 photocathode and GaAs solar cells, but suffered from high cost and low stability.6 Sivula et al. fabricated a BiVO4/Cu2O photoanode/photo-cathode tandem system and obtained ca. 0.5% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency.7 Lately, Brillet and co-workers have demonstrated a single dye sensitized solar cell (DSC)-Fe2O3 tandem cell with a STH efficiency of 1.17%.8 Li et al. reported a STH of 2.5% using a self-biased PV/PEC coupled system, consisting of a FeOOH/Mo:BiVO4 photoanode and Si solar cell-based photocathode connected in series under parallel illumination.9 Krol et al. improved the STH up to 4.9% by combining a CoPi/W-BiVO4 photoanode with Si solar cells in a tandem configuration.10 Due to the low photovoltages generated by the reported photovoltaic devices (e.g., Si, DSCs, CIGS), such systems typically consist of a triple junction design which increase the complexity due to optoelectrical trade-offs and are also not cost effective. Recently, perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have shown an unprecedented increase in solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiency, the highest being 20.1%.11,12 PVSCs with high output voltage make it possible to realize highly efficient unassisted water splitting. Several groups, such as Kamat13 and Mathews,14 have reported the integrated photoelectrochemical devices using PVSCs assembling with BiVO4 and Fe2O3 as photoelectrodes. In previous work, we have demonstrated a water splitting system by combining PVSC with a N/Si codoped TiO2 NRs photo-electrode.15 Though the STH efficiency was low, it shows the promising potential application of PVSC in the solar-to-hydrogen conversion process. The overall STH efficiency of such devices is limited by the performance of the photoelectrodes in terms of the photocurrent density and the onset potential of the PEC system.16,17 It is widely accepted that some important factors dominate the PEC performance, including (i) light absorption, (ii) charge separation and transport, and (iii) the interfacial charge transfer.18,19 In order to enhance the STH efficiency, it is highly desirable to improve the PEC capabilities via manipulating the aforementioned important factors.
The TiO2 has been extensively investigated as a photoanode for PEC water splitting owing to its proper band-edge position, superior photochemical stability, low-cost, wide availability and non-toxicity.20 However, the TiO2 suffers from a low visible light activity (ca., a bandgap of 3.0 eV for the rutile TiO2),21 fast charge carrier recombination (in the range from ms to ns)22 and slow interfacial charge transfer rate (within second timescale).23 To date, numerous methods have been tried to improve the performance of TiO2, such as doping,24,25 morphology tuning to shorten the diffusion distance of minority carriers,26,27 and coupling with smaller bandgap semiconductors to enhance the light absorbance.28,29 Especially, a heterojunction photo-electrode containing two or more different semiconductors offers promising advantages in a PEC system, which can not only improve light absorption ability due to the narrow bandgap semiconductors, but also enhance the charge separation efficiency because of their appropriate bandgap positions.30,31
Recently, BiVO4, acting as the primary light-absorber with a wide light absorption range (a bandgap of ca. 2.4 eV),32 has been reported to form heterojunctions with other semiconductors aiming to improve their PEC performance, such as WO3,33 Al doped ZnO,34 and Fe2O3.35 The TiO2/BiVO4 nanocomposite film has also been reported for PEC water oxidation, showing a photocurrent density of only 0.2 mA cm−2 under visible light at 1.23 V (vs. RHE) in a 1 M NaOH electrolyte.36 This could be attributed to the unusual spatial transfer of visible-excited high-energy electrons from the BiVO4 to the TiO2. Kimura et al. presented a different mechanism to elaborate the enhancement a TiO2/BiVO4 composite electrode.37 A higher photocurrent density of 0.44 mA cm−2 (1.67 V vs. RHE) was reported, which was attributed to the improved charge transfer from BiVO4 to TiO2 and the unique ultrafine morphology compared to the bare materials. Later on, Li et al. further improved the TiO2/BiVO4 heterojunction photocatalytic performance by controlling the contact facet between the two materials.38 They ascribed the higher photocurrent density at the BiVO4-110-TiO2 heterojunction to the high charge carrier separation capacity and the facilitated electron transfer from the {110} facet of BiVO4 to TiO2 due to a smaller interfacial energy barrier. It is noted that all these electrodes are made of the TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs), which are not beneficial to electron collection compared to one dimensional nanomaterials.39 In addition, most of the reported TiO2 NPs for PEC water splitting are polycrystalline, which limits electron diffusion and accelerates electron–hole recombination due to trap states at grain boundaries among the particles.40
This work communicates a novel core/shell TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode for PEC water splitting. A STH efficiency of 1.24% was achieved in combination with a perovskite solar cell (Scheme 1). This STH efficiency is the highest reported value compared to those of other TiO2-based PV/PEC devices. The PEC properties of the TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode can be improved which benefit from the excellent light absorption properties of BiVO4 and a fast electron transfer process in the single crystalline TiO2 NRs. Especially, the type-II band alignment between the BiVO4 and TiO2 provides a large driving force for electron injection from the BiVO4 to the TiO2. More importantly, the conduction band of the rutile TiO2 is lower than that of anatase TiO2,41 which theoretically allows faster electron transfer from BiVO4 to rutile TiO2 than to anatase TiO2.

Experimental section
Synthesis of the TiO2-based photoanodes
The TiO2 NRs photoanode was hydrothermally synthesized directly onto a FTO substrate according to our previous reports.42 In a typical experiment, 15 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37 wt%) was diluted by 15 mL of deionized (DI) water. 500 μL of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, >99%) was then added to the diluted HCl solution. After 30 min of continuous stirring, the precursor solution was transferred into a 50 mL sealed Teflon reactor. The clean FTO substrate was placed horizontally at the bottom of the reactor with the conductive side facing down. The sealed autoclave was heated at 150 °C for 12 h in an oven and cooled naturally to room temperature. The sample was then washed with de-ionized (DI) water and dried by a high purity nitrogen stream. Finally, single-crystal rutile TiO2 NRs were obtained after annealing in air at 450 °C for 2 h. The BiVO4 nanoparticles were deposited onto the TiO2 NRs with a facile spray pyrolysis method. A solution containing 20 mM bismuth and 20 mM vanadium prepared by dissolving bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Aladdin, 99%) and vanadyl acetylacetonate (Aladdin, 99%) in 2-methoxyethanol (Alfa Aesar, 99%) was sprayed directly onto the TiO2 NRs at a temperature of 450 °C. The film was subsequently annealed in air at 450 °C for another 2 h. For comparison, the pure BiVO4 film was also synthesized on a FTO substrate under the same conditions. All reagents were analytical grade and solutions were prepared with DI water.
Fabrication of a perovskite solar cell (PVSC)
The FTO glass was first etched to form two separated electrodes before being cleaned ultrasonically with ethanol. Then, the patterned substrates were coated by a compact TiO2 layer by aerosol spray pyrolysis, and a 20 nm nanoporous TiO2 layer was deposited by screen-printing. After being sintered at 500 °C for 30 min, the perovskite absorber layer was deposited using the two-step sequential deposition method.43 The mesoporous TiO2 films were infiltrated with PbI2 by spin-coating a PbI2 solution in DMF (500 mg mL−1) that was kept at 70 °C. After drying, the films were dipped in a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (10 mg mL−1) for 20 s and rinsed with 2-propanol. A 1 μm Al2O3 space layer was printed on the top of the nanoporous TiO2 layer using Al2O3 slurry, which acted as an insulating layer to prevent electrons from reaching the back contact. Then it was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. A carbon black/graphite counter electrode with the thickness of about 8 μm was coated on the top of the Al2O3 layer by printing carbon black/graphite composite slurry (1:4) and sintering at 400 °C for 30 min. Finally, the perovskite solar cells were obtained. All experiments were carried out at room temperature.
Assembling the PV/PEC device
As shown in Scheme 1, the overall solar water splitting system was composed of a TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode, a PVSC and twisted platinum wire.
Characterizations
The morphology of the samples was determined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Nova NanoSEM 450, Netherlands). The microstructure of the TiO2@BiVO4 film was further investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Tecnai G2 F30, The Netherlands). The crystalline structure of all samples was identified through X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert PRO, PANalytical B.V. Co., The Netherlands) using Cu Kα source radiation.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The PEC activity was performed using a traditional three-electrode configuration using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI 630D, Shanghai Chenhua, China) with 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH = 7.0) or 0.1 M PBS (pH = 7.0) with 0.1 M Na2SO3 solution as the supporting electrolyte. The photoanode (area = 1 cm2), a Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE) and twisted platinum wire acted as the working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively. The measured potential (vs. SCE) is converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale via the Nernst equation: ERHE = ESCE + 0.059pH + E°SCE(1)where ERHE is the converted potential (vs. RHE), ESCE is the experimental potential measured against the reference electrode, and E°SCE = 0.2415 V at 25 °C. The electrolyte was purged with high-purity N2 for 30 min to remove dissolved oxygen and prevent signals from oxygen reduction. A 300 W xenon lamp (Newport, model 69911, USA) coupled with an AM 1.5 G filter, calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 with a silicon diode, was used as the light source. Linear sweep voltammetry was performed at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 under simulated solar irradiation (xenon lamp with an AM 1.5 G filter, 100 mW cm−2) with alternating 2 s light on–off cycles. The monochromatic incident photon to current efficiency was calculated from chronoamperometry measurements at 1.23 V vs. RHE using a motorized monochromator (Newport, model 70356, USA). Gas chromatography (Trustworthy Instrument, GC-2020N, China) was used to verify the composition of evolution bubbles both on the photoanode and the counter electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed under similar conditions as described above. The impedance versus frequency spectrum was performed at open circuit potential over the frequency range between 100 kHz and 0.01 Hz, with an AC voltage magnitude of 10 mV amplitude.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the SEM and TEM images of the TiO2 NRs and TiO2@BiVO4 films. The individual TiO2 nanorods are vertically aligned on the surface of FTO substrates with an average diameter of 100 nm (Fig. 1a). Fig. S1b† presents their cross-section field-emission scanning electron microscope images. The nanorod arrays are uniform and well-separated with an average length of 3 μm. After deposition of BiVO4, the length of TiO2@BiVO4 samples was nearly unchanged as shown in Fig. S1c.† A set of sharp spots in the SEM (Fig. S1b†) and TEM images (Fig. S1d†) indicate that the synthesized TiO2 NRs are single crystalline.44 The pure BiVO4 film exhibits a mesoporous structure with an average grain size of ca. 250 nm (Fig. S1a†). After spray deposition, the TiO2 NRs are fully covered with BiVO4 nanoparticles (Fig. 1b and S1c†). The microstructure of the composite film is further characterized with high-resolution TEM. Fig. 1c exhibits the lattice fringe spacings of 0.248 nm and 0.237 nm, which match well with the (101) plane of the rutile TiO2 and (202) plane of the monoclinic BiVO4, respectively (the inset of Fig. 1c). Fig. 1d shows the HAADF-STEM image of the TiO2@BiVO4 film, from which we can see that the BiVO4 nanoparticles with a thickness of about 30–70 nm partially cover the TiO2 nanorods. The elemental mapping image (Fig. 1e) indicates that the BiVO4 adheres very well to the TiO2 NRs, which is consistent with the results of Fig. 1c. The TEM-EDX (Fig. 1f) clearly shows that the Bi and V elements are not observed within the position of 70–100 nm. This result coupled with the observed lattice fringe spacing indicates that no Bi or V doped TiO2 is present in the TiO2@BiVO4 film. In order to further demonstrate that the TiO2 NRs are covered by BiVO4 nanoparticles, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was performed. Fig. S2a† shows an XPS survey spectrum of the TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode, including the signals from the Ti, O, Bi, and V elements. A high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ti 2p is shown in Fig. S2b.† The two symmetric peaks of Ti 2p located at 458.6 and 464.4 eV are ascribed to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 for the TiO2 sample, respectively, which indicate a formal valence of four (Ti4+).15 The two XPS peaks at 164.5 and 159.2 eV could be clearly observed as shown in Fig. S2c,† which are attributed to the signals from Bi 4f5/2 and Bi 4d7/2 of Bi3+ in BiVO4.45 Fig. S2d† shows the V 2p and O 1s XPS spectra of TiO2@BiVO4. The V 2p peaks of 517 eV and 524.3 eV are attributed to the V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 of V5+ in BiVO4, respectively.46 The O 1s peak of 530.0 eV is attributed to the lattice oxygen of BiVO4 (Bi–O bond) and the peak at 532.2 eV corresponds to the O–H bonds on the surface, respectively.47 These results are consistent with the XRD and Raman spectra as shown in Fig. S3 and S4a.†

Fig. 2a shows the representative chopped-light current density versus potential (J–V) curves for various photoanodes. Significantly, the TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode exhibits the highest photocurrent density among all samples. The photocurrent density reaches 1.3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is 3.25 and 4-fold larger than those of the TiO2 NRs and BiVO4 NPs at 1.23 V vs. RHE, respectively. As shown in Table S1,† the photocurrent density for the TiO2@BiVO4 heterojunction obtained in our study is much larger than those in previous reports.37 More importantly, the photocurrent density of the TiO2@BiVO4 electrode is obviously higher than those of the BiVO4 NPs and TiO2 NRs even at the low potential from 0.18 to 0.4 V vs. RHE. This result demonstrates that the charge separation is significantly improved for the TiO2@BiVO4 electrode. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis demonstrates that the evolution gas is composed of H2 and O2. Fig. S5† presents the amount of evolved O2 and H2 gas as a function of operation time. The amount of evolved O2 gas is similar to the half of the amount of H2 gas, which is close to the theoretical amount calculated by integration of the photocurrent passing through the external circuit (i.e., a faradaic efficiency close to unity). It should be noted that no other by-products except H2 and O2 have been detected by gas chromatography, which implies that no other reaction occurs during the process.
 Fig. 2  The PEC performance of the TiO2 NRs, BiVO4 NPs and TiO2@BiVO4 photoanodes in 0.1 M PBS electrolytes (pH = 7.0). (a) J–V curves collected at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 under alternating 2 s light on–off cycles (100 mW cm−2) and (b) IPCE plots measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE. 
IPCE measurements were carried out under irradiation at 1.23 V vs. RHE to evaluate possible synergistic effects between TiO2 and BiVO4. The IPCE values are calculated using the following equation. (2)where Jp is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), P(λ) is the incident-light power density for each wavelength (mW cm−2), and λ is the incident-light wavelength (nm), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2b, photons in the 400–550 nm wavelength range are primarily absorbed by the BiVO4 nanoparticles, since they are at the out layer and have a stronger light absorption than TiO2 NRs as shown in Fig. S4b.† Nevertheless, the IPCE value of the TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode in the 350–400 nm range is four times higher than that of the bare BiVO4 NPs. This indicates that the TiO2 NRs improve the charge collection efficiency. As shown in Fig. S6,† the ultraviolet light absorption of the TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode is enhanced due to the presence of TiO2 NRs, and the wide-spectrum absorption in the visible light region is similar to that of the BiVO4 NPs. The APCE value of the TiO2@BiVO4 is higher than that of the BiVO4 NPs within the 450–550 nm range, which indicates that the electrons can efficiently transfer from the BiVO4 to the TiO2 due to the suitable band position of the two materials, and thus retards the recombination of the photo-generated carriers. This is consistent with the results of the M–S plot (Fig. S7†) and UPS measurements (Fig. 5) as discussed below. The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) obtained by using a two-electrode system (working electrode and a Pt counter electrode) is also shown in Fig. S8.† The TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode exhibits a better efficiency than the TiO2 NRs and BiVO4 NPs. Therefore, the IPCE result suggests that the nanostructured TiO2@BiVO4 heterojunction can make full use of the advantages of each component, which includes the excellent light absorption of BiVO4 and the fast electron transfer properties of the single crystalline TiO2 NRs.
The PEC properties of the tandem cell were determined, which was composed of a TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode (PA) and a CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskite solar cell (PVSC). As shown in Fig. 3a, the incident light is selectively absorbed by a TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode, and the remaining lower energy visible-near IR light is harvested by the PVSC device. The operating photocurrent density of such a tandem cell can be predicted from the intersection of the individual J–V curves as shown in Fig. 3b (∼1.14 mA cm−2). When combining with the PEC cell, the PVSC device could provide the necessary potential to drive the water-splitting reaction as indicated in Fig. 3c. The quantity of evolved H2 gas (measured with GC) and faradaic efficiency are shown in Fig. 3d. The photocurrent matched closely with the anticipated value (∼1 mA cm−2), indicating that electrons derived from the PVSC device can indeed induce proton reduction at the Pt surface. The amount of H2 is close to the theoretical amount calculated by integration of the photocurrent over time for hydrogen evolution (two-electron process). The overall STH efficiency of the TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode+PVSC system was calculated to be 1.24%, which was 6 times higher than that of the TiO2 NRs photoanode+PVSC device. The average faradaic efficiency values were evaluated to be 98.6% and 86% for the TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode+PVSC (Fig. 3d) and TiO2 NRs photoanode+PVSC devices (Fig. S9†), respectively. The higher efficiency could be attributed to the higher photocurrent density, lower onset-potential for the TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode, and the appropriate light-absorption alignments between the TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode and the perovskite solar cell.

The IPCE plot of the PSC device was measured through a TiO2@BiVO4 filter, and the IPCE plot for TiO2@BiVO4 PA was recorded at 1.01 V in a two-electrode system (Pt as the counter electrode). (b) Superimposed J–V curves of the individual TiO2@BiVO4 PA and PSC device. The J–V curve of the TiO2@BiVO4 PA was measured in a two electrode system with a Pt counter electrode. The predicted operating point of the tandem device is at the intersection of the two curves. (c) I–T curves for the TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode+PVSC device, demonstrating the ability to drive neutral water splitting without external bias. (d) The faradaic efficiency and quantity of detected hydrogen derived from the TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode+PVSC device under irradiation. Red lines correspond to the integration of the net photocurrent divided by 2. Red circles correspond to the H2 gas measured by gas chromatography during the experiment. 
To gain deeper understanding of the excellent PEC performance of the TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode, the individual light harvesting efficiency (LHE, LHE = 1–10−A), separation (ηsep) and transfer (ηtransfer) efficiencies were determined, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4a, the LHE of the TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode closely resembles that of BiVO4 with an onset at 515 nm (∼2.4 eV). Since the bare TiO2 NRs (∼3.0 eV) hardly absorb any light at the wavelength within 400 and 500 nm, the efficient visible-light absorption occurs in the BiVO4 nanoparticles despite a very thin layer (30–70 nm), which is far below the light absorption depth of about 250 nm at a wavelength of 450 nm.19 Furthermore, some photons having a wavelength shorter than 410 nm will also be absorbed by the TiO2 NRs if transmitted by the small BiVO4 nanoparticles. The BiVO4 nanoparticles, as the outer layer material, absorb most of the light in the entire 300–515 nm wavelength range. However, the light absorption enhancement is much smaller than the 4-fold enhancement in IPCE measurements between TiO2@BiVO4 and BiVO4, indicating that the enhanced light absorption is not the main cause of the difference for these photoanodes.

(b) The AM 1.5 G photon flux incident at each wavelength is used to estimate the photocurrent densities of TiO2 NRs, BiVO4 NPs and TiO2@BiVO4 heterojunction films. (c) J–V curves of all electrodes under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination with 0.1 M Na2SO3 added to the 0.1 M PBS electrolyte as a hole scavenger. (d) Charge separation efficiency (ηsep) of the photoanodes. 
The charge separation efficiency (ηsep) can be determined by adding a fast hole scavenger to the electrolyte.48 As shown in Fig. 3b, the typical J–V curves of photoanodes were obtained after 0.1 M sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) was added to the 0.1 M PBS (pH = 7.0) electrolyte as a hole scavenger. When Na2SO3 was added to the electrolyte, a photocurrent density of 1.51 mA cm−2 was generated at 1.23 V vs. RHE for the TiO2@BiVO4 electrode. Since the rate of charge transfer to the electrolyte by oxidation of Na2SO3 at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface is very fast, it can be assumed that the surface recombination of charges is eliminated and ηtransfer (Na2SO3) ≈ 100%.49 While the H2O oxidation photocurrent density is given by JH2O = Jabs × ηsep × ηtransfer, the oxidation photocurrent density of the Na2SO3 is given by JNa2SO3 = Jabs × ηsep. Here, Jabs is the photon absorption rate expressed as photocurrent density, which can be calculated by assuming an absorbed photon to current efficiency (APCE) of 100% (Fig. 4b). In order to calculate Jmax (maximum photocurrent density assuming 100% IPCE) of the BiVO4 with a bandgap energy of 2.4 eV, a reference solar spectral irradiance at AM 1.5 G (radiation energy (W m−2 nm−1) vs. wavelength (nm)) from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory was first converted to the solar energy spectrum in terms of number of photons (s−1 m−2 nm−1) vs. wavelength (nm).32 Then, the number of photons above the bandgap energy of BiVO4 shown in this study was calculated using a trapezoidal integration (in 5 nm increments) of the spectrum and converted to the current density (mA cm−2). In order to calculate Jabs (the photocurrent density assuming 100% APCE, APCE = IPCE/LHE, and LHE = 1–10−A), the LHE at each wavelength was multiplied during each step of the trapezoidal integration.32 Using these conditions, the Jabs of BiVO4, TiO2 NRs and TiO2/BiVO4 films was obtained as shown in Fig. 4b, respectively. Assuming that the addition of Na2SO3 does not change the light absorption, pH or flat band potential of the electrodes, the saturated photocurrent density for H2O and Na2SO3 oxidation should be the same for each photoanode, indicating that no current doubling occurs in the presence of Na2SO3. Similarly, Jabs and ηsep are the same for JH2O and JNa2SO3. Therefore, ηsep can be calculated using JNa2SO3/Jabs, and the result is shown in Fig. 3c. The augmented IPCE primarily comes from the efficient charge separation (ηsep) in the TiO2@BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode. Because the average diameter (ca. 250 nm) of the material is larger than the hole diffusion length in BiVO4 (ca. 100 nm),50 a strong bulk recombination would induce a low charge separation for the BiVO4 NPs (ηsep < 30%, Fig. 4d). As discussed above, photo-induced carriers are generated mostly by the light absorption in the BiVO4 nanoparticles and to a smaller extent by light absorption in the TiO2 NRs for the TiO2@BiVO4 hetero-junction photoanode. Considering the charges generated in the thick BiVO4 layer (30–70 nm, Fig. 1d), therefore holes can readily reach the semiconductor/electrolyte interface because they only need to travel a short distance which is less than the reported hole diffusion length in BiVO4 (ca. 100 nm).51 Holes generated in the BiVO4 also have a low probability of reaching and recombining at defect states at the FTO/TiO2 interface due to a lower valence band position of the rutile TiO2 than that of BiVO4. Thus, in the TiO2@BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode, the generated electrons in the BiVO4 nanoparticles could travel along the TiO2 NRs, and then reach the FTO substrate. This can largely decrease the bulk recombination probability of charge carriers. A similar ‘host–guest’ approach has been demonstrated for Fe2O3 with WO3 as the host.52 In addition, apart from the small thickness of the BiVO4 layer, the electric field due to the staggered type-II TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode also significantly improves the separation as evidenced by the ηsep values. As seen in Fig. 4d, the TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode electrode has higher charge separation efficiency (∼65%) than that of BiVO4 NPs (∼26.4%). This result agrees well with the EIS measurement (Fig. S10†), where the TiO2@BiVO4 photo-anode exhibits the smallest charge transfer resistance among the three samples. The EIS result demonstrates an effective separation of photo-generated carriers and faster interfacial charge transfer occurring in the TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode.
In order to further determine the charge transfer direction of the photo-generated electrons between the BiVO4 and TiO2, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectra were recorded. As shown in Fig. 5, the valence band energy (Ev) of TiO2 NRs and BiVO4 NPs can be determined by subtracting the width of the He I UPS spectra from the excitation energy (21.22 eV).53 The valence band energies (Ev) were 7.22 eV and 6.4 eV for TiO2 NRs and BiVO4 NPs, respectively. The conduction band energies (Ec) were thus estimated at 4.22 eV and 4.0 eV from Ev–Eg for TiO2 NRs and BiVO4 NPs, respectively. The Ev and Ec values of TiO2 NRs and BiVO4 NPs in electron volts are converted to electrochemical energy potentials in volts according to the reference standard for which 0 V versus RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) equals −4.44 eV versus evac (vacuum level). Therefore, the Ec values of TiO2 NRs and BiVO4 NPs are −0.18 V (vs. RHE) and −0.4 V (vs. RHE), respectively. Obviously, the difference of the Ecb values for the BiVO4 and TiO2 is 0.22 V vs. RHE. This result is consistent with the flat-band potential (Efb) from the Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. S7†). Obviously, the difference of the Efb values (0.23 V vs. RHE) for the BiVO4 and TiO2 is larger than that in a previous report (0.13 V vs. RHE),37 which provides a larger driving force for electron transfer from BiVO4 to TiO2. Therefore, the charge separation in a TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode is more efficient than that in the individuals.37 These results provide strong evidence for efficient rectifying charge transfer and separation between the BiVO4 and the TiO2.

Conclusions
In summary, the critical advancement in this work is that a novel core/shell TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode can simultaneously improve the light absorption and charge separation, and thus improve the STH efficiency of an integrated perovskite solar cell with a PEC system. The TiO2@BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode can reach a high photocurrent density of 1.3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, coupling with a low onset potential (0.18 V vs. RHE) under standard testing conditions. Such significant PEC performance originates from the enhanced light absorption and efficient charge separation with a high efficiency of 65% at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The potential difference in the conduction band between the BiVO4 and rutile TiO2 provides a large driving force for electron transfer from the BiVO4 to TiO2. Importantly, this work provides an economical and facile strategy to prepare the nanostructure used in PEC cells, which is also applicable to fabricate other heterostructures used in photovoltaic devices. An overall STH efficiency of 1.24% can be achieved by assembling an efficient perovskite solar cell with the TiO2@BiVO4 photoanode.
