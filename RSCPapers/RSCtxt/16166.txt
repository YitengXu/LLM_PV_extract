    , Accepted 26th August 2020First published on 27th August 2020AbstractThe low conductivity, shuttling phenomenon, and sluggish transformation of intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) constitute primary obstacles for the practical application of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. Ultrathin double-shell nanotubes of titanium oxide with oxygen-vacancy@nitrogen-doped carbon (denoted as OV-TiO2−x@NC) as the sulfur host were designed. As demonstrated by experimental and computational results, an ultrathin TiO2−x shell featuring a small aspect ratio can not only provide rapid charge transfer but also shorten the diffusion pathway of lithium ions. Furthermore, the special double-shell nanostructure with the large surface area can accommodate high number of sulfur species, provide effective channels for the electrolyte penetration, supply adequate buffer space for alleviating the volume expansion of sulfur upon repeated cycling, and provide both physical and chemical adsorption to efficiently capture LiPSs. The OV-TiO2−x inner shell with a small aspect ratio is compactly packed and tightly adhered to the carbon layer, which can effectively anchor LiPSs with strong chemical affinity and prevent their diffusion from the inner to the outside layer. More importantly, the introduction of oxygen-vacancies can enhance the conductivity of electrode, restrict the loss of LiPSs into the electrolyte, strengthen electrocatalytic activity, and accelerate LiPSs conversion. Endowed with these properties, the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode enables excellent electrochemical performance, including long cycle stability of 531 mA h g−1 for 3000 cycles at 5C with decay rate of only 0.0123%, excellent rate capability of 675 mA h g−1 at 8C and high areal capacity of 8.01 mA h cm−2 with sulfur mass loading of 9.5 mg cm−2 under low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S = 5). This work provides perspective on altering the electronic states of OV–metal oxides toward high energy density Li–S batteries and promotes the progress of catalysis or energy storage systems.
1. Introduction
With the remarkable growing demands for energy storage appliances, such as portable electronic devices, electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), state-of-the-art lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have nearly reached their energy density limits; thus, it is challenging to meet the ever growing requirements for energy storage devices.1–4 Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries have received significant attention due to their advantage of natural abundance, non-toxic nature, environmental friendliness, ultra-high theoretical capacity (1675 mA h g−1) and energy density (2567 W h kg−1). It is not surprising that they have become one of the most promising candidates for the new generation of rechargeable energy storage systems.5–13 Nevertheless, the commercialization of Li–S batteries suffers from series of bottlenecks. First, the low conductivity of sulfur (S8, 5 × 10−30 S cm−1) and the insulating nature of lithium sulfides (discharge products, Li2S2/Li2S) cause sluggish kinetics and inferior sulfur utilization.14 Secondly, a huge volume variation (∼80%) occurs upon the lithiation process, leading to the pulverization of active materials and poor cycle performance.15 Thirdly, the lithium polysulfide (Li2Sx, 4 ≤ x ≤ 8) that dissolves into the organic-based electrolyte may lead to the undesirable “shuttle effect”, and further trigger parasitic reactions on the lithium anode, rapid capacity decay, and large electrochemical resistance.16,17
Tremendous attempts have been implemented to tackle above-mentioned problems, such as optimizing host materials for the sulfur cathode, developing functional binders and electrolytes, or using functional separators.18,19 Carbon-based nanomaterials, include micro–mesoporous carbon,20 graphene,21 carbon nanofibers/nanotubes,15 and hollow carbon nanostructures5,22 have been widely utilized as host materials towards improving the electronic conductivity and reducing the polarization resistance of the sulfur-based cathode. Indeed, carbon materials possess large specific area, which provide more sulfur loading and electrical contact sites. However, due to the inferior physical confinement between non-polar carbon materials and polar LiPSs, carbon-based materials are unable to effectively reduce the shuttle effect, which results in serious capacity decay.23
Recently, a great number of polar inorganic substances (metal oxides such as MnO2,24 TiO2,25 and V2O3,26 or metal sulfides such as ZnS,27 VS4,28 and MoS2 (ref. 29)) have been functionalized as electrocatalysts. The strong chemical interaction with LiPSs can effectively anchor LiPSs and efficiently speed up the kinetics conversions of soluble long-chain LiPSs into insoluble short-chain Li2S2/Li2S. Among various polar materials, TiO2 has been extensively investigated as an additive or substrate in Li–S batteries. For instance, Cui et al. synthesized core–shell sulfur–TiO2 nanocomposites to minimize LiPSs dissolution.25 However, such polar host materials always possess poor electrical conductivities, resulting in dissatisfactory rate capabilities and slow electron transport. Fortunately, introducing defects into nanomaterials plays a vital role in catalytic energy storage and conversion systems. The presence of defects can significantly alter the electronic structures as well as the ion energetics and electron transportation in the metal oxide.30 Moreover, defects can dramatically shrink the band gap of TiO2via alteration of the valence band (VB). Thus, the energy barrier of interfacial charge transfer can be decreased, which facilitates charge transfer from matrices to adsorbates.31 Last but not least, localized electronic vacancies should be regarded as active cores of the adsorbed molecules, hence the reintegration of charge obstacles can be efficiently restrained.32 It is reasonable to anticipate that introduction of defects can dramatically enhance the conductivity of the host material as well as supply many suspended unsaturated bonds at the surface of TiO2, leading to a strong catalytic ability and chemically interactive affinity to sulfur species.30 For example, Mai et al. reported an OV-TiO2 modified separator with significant improvement of cycle performance towards Li–S batteries.33 Ding et al. designed TiO2−x nanosheets supported by CNT frameworks to improve the electrical conductivity of sulfur cathodes and strengthen the interaction between anatase TiO2−x with sulfur.34 Nonetheless, such randomly dispersed oxygen-vacancies in TiO2−x on porous carbon nanostructures lacks efficient physical confinements to prevent LiPSs from diffusing away from the host materials. Furthermore, due to the irregular morphologies (e.g. nanoparticles and nanosheets) of polar materials, the uniform distribution of sulfur on the hosts cannot be guaranteed, and volume expansions upon cycling processes are unavoidable.35 More importantly, challenges such as the limited sulfur mass loading, the loss of LiPSs into electrolytes, and low sulfur utilization rate must still be addressed.
Herein, ultrathin double-shell nanotubes of titanium oxide with oxygen-vacancy@nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (denoted as OV-TiO2−x@NC) towards high performance Li–S batteries were introduced. The correlation between the structure and the electrochemical enhancements were comprehensively and convincingly investigated. The double-shell heterostructure featuring a highly conductive N-doped carbon outer shell and an ultrathin defect-rich TiO2−x inner layer endowed the following advantages: (1) it provides both physical and strong chemical affinity towards LiPSs to restrict shuttle effects. (2) The ultrathin inner shell of TiO2−x with oxygen vacancies, which is compactly packed and tightly adhered to the outer carbon shell, significantly improves the electronic conductivity of the cathode, shortens charge transfer pathways and accelerates the redox kinetics of LiPSs. (3) The robust carbon framework can not only afford high void space to accommodate the volume change of sulfur, but also guarantee high sulfur loading. Accordingly, Li–S batteries employing OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrodes deliver a long cycle life, outstanding rate performance, and high areal capacity. As an example, this work shows the promise of defect engineering for enhancing adsorption and catalysis and for advancing the development of superior Li–S batteries.
2. Results and discussion
The fabrication process of the one-dimensional (1D) tubular OV-TiO2−x@NC host is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1, and its detailed synthesized procedures can be indexed in the Experimental section in the ESI.† First, high aspect ratio MnO2 nanowires (NWs) were synthesized by the traditional hydrothermal method and subsequently served as a hard template.24 Next, the TiO2 layer was uniformly grown on the surface of MnO2 NWs via a sol–gel method to yield core–shell MnO2@amorphous TiO2 (MnO2@a-TiO2) NWs.5 After the thermal treatment under an air atmosphere at 500 °C, the as-obtained MnO2@TiO2 NWs were further coated with an ultrathin shell of polydopamine (PDA) to acquire coaxial MnO2@TiO2@PDA NWs. Then, the composites were annealed in an Ar/H2 mixed atmosphere at 700 °C and then treated in an H2C2O4 acid solution to etch off the MnO2 cores. The outer PDA layers were transformed into the nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer at 700 °C. At the same time, oxygen vacancies were introduced under a reducing atmosphere of hydrogen, and the resultant hierarchical porous OV-TiO2−x@NC nanotubes were obtained. Finally, sulfur infiltrated into the OV-TiO2−x@NC host by the melt-diffusion method to obtain the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S nanotubes.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagrams of the synthetic process of the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S. 
The microstructures of the as-synthesized nanocomposites were recorded by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As depicted in the SEM and TEM images (Fig. S1, ESI†), MnO2 NWs show a typical 1D wire-like nanostructure with an average size of ≈100 nm. Thereafter, 1D MnO2@TiO2 products (SEM images, Fig. S2a and b†) are obtained after growing an ultrathin TiO2 shell (thickness ≈ 6–10 nm, TEM images, Fig. S2c and d†) onto the surface of the MnO2 NWs. It should be noted that the ultrathin characteristics can not only provide rapid charge transfer but also shorten the diffusion pathway for lithium ions. As a control sample, MnO2 NWs were directly coated with a thin PDA shell to acquire the coaxial MnO2@PDA NWs. FE-SEM images (Fig. S3a and b†) show that MnO2@PDA NWs maintain the 1D wire-like architecture. Furthermore, TEM images show that the thickness of the PDA shell is about 10 nm (Fig. S3c and d†). After annealing under a H2 reducing atmosphere, the obtained OV-TiO2−x@NC (Fig. 2a and b) shows no obvious alteration in morphology when compared with those of TiO2@NC (Fig. S4†) and NC nanotubes (Fig. S5†). The unique 1D hollow morphology of the resultant OV-TiO2−x@NC (Fig. 2c and d) was entirely retained without obvious damage after etching the MnO2 core. More importantly, the unique double-shell nanostructure featuring an outer layer of N-doped carbon and an inner layer of compactly packed TiO2−x shell was easily distinguished and verified by the HRTEM image (Fig. 2e). The corresponding rapid Fourier transform (FFT) mode (Fig. 2e and its inset) shows mixed phases of anatase (A) and rutile (R) with different crystalline states of OV-TiO2−x. The PDA layer was then transformed into an amorphous carbon shell by annealing, which yielded a great number of porous nanohybrid structures. These nanohybrids provide more facile binding sites and facilitate the effective transportation of lithium ions.

(m) EDX spectrum, (n) bright-field STEM image and (o–s) the elemental mapping images of carbon, titanium, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur in the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S. 
Notably, the comparatively disordered lattices are recognized from the inverse FFT (IFFT) image (Fig. 2f, pink rectangle area) because of the emergence of the low valence titanium onto the Ti–O shell, while the inner TiO2 maintains a relatively crystalline lattice. The hybrid nanostructures can be anticipated to enhance the electrophilicity of LiPSs, provide trapping sites for charge carriers and speeding up interfacial charge transfer between Ti and adsorbed LiPSs.18 The prominent difference between the crystalline (Fig. 2g, green dotted framework, ≈0.324 nm) and disordered (Fig. 2h, pink dotted framework, ≈0.326 nm with slightly expanded interplanar spacing) regions can be observed in the representative lattice fringed spacing (110) crystal planes. Additionally, the intensity of the line files (Fig. 2h) also exhibits differences from the left edge region to the right and central positions. The structural distortion may derive from the oxygen loss of the intrinsic defective-rich TiO2 lattice and compressive stress at the TiO2−x@NC interfaces.18 The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2i) displays the poly-crystalline characteristics in the sample. The diffraction rings from inside to outside index to the R(110), R(101), A(101), R(111), and R(211) crystal faces of titanium oxide, respectively. After sulfur infiltrated into the OV-TiO2−x@NC host, the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S also maintains its original 1D nanostructure (SEM images, Fig. 2j and k). The TEM image (Fig. 2l) shows that the inner space of OV-TiO2−x@NC nanohybrids are much darker after sulfur loading, indicating that active material sulfur particles have been successfully accommodated and immobilized within the nanostructured host.22 The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) signals (Fig. 2m) at 2.30 keV also implies the existence of sulfur among the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S. The typical STEM image (Fig. 2n) and its corresponding elemental mappings (Fig. 2o–s) imply the homogeneous dispersion of carbon (C), titanium (Ti), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S), respectively.
The crystalline structures and phase transitions of the composites were revealed via the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. As depicted in Fig. S6a,† the original MnO2 NWs exhibit typical sharp diffraction peaks, which is correlated to the beta crystalline phase (JCPDS no. 24-0735). After the formation of the TiO2 layer and calcination process, the XRD pattern of MnO2@TiO2 NWs (Fig. S6b†) shows typical diffraction peaks of β-MnO2 and anatase TiO2 phases, indicating that MnO2@TiO2 with a crystalline TiO2 shell was synthesized. As exhibited in Fig. S6c,† the XRD pattern of the as-synthesized NC nanotubes only exhibits the feature of amorphous carbon. As delivered in Fig. 3a, both XRD patterns of the TiO2@NC and OV-TiO2−x@NC exhibit the mixed phase of anatase (JCPDS no. 21-1272) and rutile (JCPDS no. 21-1276) in titanium oxide.36 Obviously, the rutile phase is more dominant than that of the anatase phase with increasing annealing temperature. Considering the rutile phase possesses much higher electronic conductivity than the anatase phase, its dominance is improves the electrochemical performance.37 A broad diffraction peak can also be detected at 22.4°, which is indexed to the (002) plane of amorphous carbon. Interestingly, the magnified XRD pattern (Fig. 3b) of the OV-TiO2−x@NC manifests a considerably blue-shifted peak when compared with that of TiO2@NC. The phenomenon may be ascribed to the atomic rearrangement and reconstruction of TiO2, which may partially change the O–Ti–O bond distance during the defect introduction process.18 The existence of orthorhombic sulfur (JCPDS no. 08-0247) indicates that sulfur species successfully infiltrated into OV-TiO2−x@NC/S (Fig. S6d†). The Raman spectrum of TiO2@NC (Fig. 3c) exhibits characteristic vibrational peaks at around 232 (Eg), 444 (Eg) and 611 cm−1 (A1g) corresponding to the vibrational peak of the rutile Ti–O bonds.6 The peak at about 144 cm−1 is correlated to the anatase phase of TiO2. This result confirms the co-existence of rutile and anatase TiO2 phases, which is in good agreement with the XRD patterns. It should be noted that the red-shifted wavenumber of the Eg peak (157 cm−1, inset plot) in the OV-TiO2−x@NC may be associated with the shortening of the correlation length due to the phonon confinement effect of localized oxygen-defects.34 Additionally, both Raman spectra of TiO2@NC and OV-TiO2−x@NC samples exhibit two distinguished peaks at about 1350 and 1590 cm−1 (Fig. 3d), which are assigned to the vibrations of the D band (disordered carbon) and G band (sp2 ordered graphitic carbon), respectively. Also, the peak intensity ratio (ID/IG) of OV-TiO2−x@NC (0.93) is lower than that of TiO2@NC (1.10), implying a higher degree of graphitization in OV-TiO2−x@NC, which can improve the electrical conductivity.18

The bond characteristics and surface chemical states were further measured using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS full-scan spectra (Fig. S7†) show that both TiO2@NC/S and OV-TiO2−x@NC/S contain C, Ti, O, N and S. The high-resolution N 1s spectrum (Fig. S8,† 4.6 wt% nitrogen content) can be divided into three peaks, which are assigned to pyridinic N (398.7 eV), pyrrolic N (400.4 eV) and graphitic N (401.9 eV), respectively.7 The high-resolution C 1s spectrum of TiO2−x@NC/S (Fig. S9†) is fitted into three bonds of C–C or CC (284.7 eV), C–N (285.4 eV) and C–O (286.6 eV), respectively, which is analogous to the TiO2@NC spectrum. Two remarkable peaks emerging at 458.9 and 464.5 eV in the TiO2@NC/S can be indexed to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 of Ti4+ (Fig. 3e), respectively, which is in agreement with the normal saturated state of Ti4+ in TiO2.7 In contrast, two distinguished adjacent spin–orbit peaks at 458.3 and 463.9 eV are related to the presence of Ti3+ in the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S (Fig. 3e), and a slight red-shift of 0.5 eV in the binding energy verifies the different chemical states of Ti cations in the hydrogenated phase. The positively charged Ti3+ nuclei will increase the electron cloud density and decrease the valence state of Ti from TiO2@NC to OV-TiO2−x@NC, therefore creating a weaker binding effect.30 As depicted in Fig. 3f, the deconvoluted peaks of the O 1s spectrum of OV-TiO2−x@NC/S show three components, which can be assigned to lattice oxygen in TiO2−x (Ti–O, 530.7 eV), oxygen functional groups on the materials (C–O, 531.4 eV), and defective oxygen (vacancies/defects) or adsorbed surface –OH (OOH) species on TiO2−x (532.6 eV, oxygen vacancies content of 17.8%), respectively. For comparison, no obvious characteristic peak can be observed in TiO2@NC/S, demonstrating the lack of surface defects.
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) characterization was performed to examine the surface defects of the samples. As shown in Fig. 3g, TiO2@NC shows almost no signal of oxygen vacancies, whereas OV-TiO2−x@NC shows a pronounced response peak at a g-value of about 2.001, corresponding to the formation of defects during the reduction process.34,38 The integrated electron band structure of OV-TiO2−x@NC was further examined via UV/vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS, Fig. 3h). For all samples, the absorption peak significantly increases at wavelengths below 400 nm, which is related to its intrinsic band gap absorption from the core of crystalline rutile TiO2.39 Soon after, the absorption peak of OV-TiO2−x@NC shows obvious enhancement at wavelengths larger than 400 nm in the visible region and extends to the near-infrared (NIR) region, which is apparently superior to that of TiO2@NC. The improved wide spectrum absorption of OV-TiO2−x@NC can be ascribed to its high electron concentration, which is related to the existence of Ti3+ by introducing disordered oxygen-defects on the surface layers of TiO2−x. Extended light adsorption leads to wider solar spectra adsorption in the rutile phase, thus triggering the secondary narrow band gap.30,40,41 The XPS valence band (VB) spectrum of TiO2@NC (Fig. 3i) presents the energy density of states (DOS) feature of TiO2. The VB maximum (VBM) band margin emerges at around 2.05 eV under the Fermi energy (FE), which is consistent with previous reports.32 As for the defective OV-TiO2−x@NC, the initial absorption emerges at 1.95 eV and the corresponding VBM correlated with the band tail further shifts towards the vacuum level of FE at approximately ≈0.90 eV. The distinct downshift can be attributed to the improved interfacial charge transfer of OV-TiO2−x@NC. According to the UV-vis DRS plot and the transformed Kubelka–Munk equation (Fig. S10†),34 the corresponding optical energy band gap of TiO2@NC and OV-TiO2−x@NC are calculated to be 3.03 and 2.09 eV, respectively. The detailed energy band diagram illustration of TiO2@NC and OV-TiO2−x@NC are exhibited in Fig. 3j. The removal of oxygen atoms near the OV site is anticipated to result in the rearrangement of the surplus electrons in the shortest adjacent atoms. It is helpful to constitute the superficial donor state and offset the deficiency of the original energy band structure. Significantly, electrons below the Fermi level can directly transfer to the defect level, which can effectively enhance the electron transfer of OV-TiO2−x@NC. Benefiting from the above-mentioned contributions, the as-synthesized OV-TiO2−x@NC host exhibits a significantly higher electronic conductivity (1.23 × 103 S m−1) than that of TiO2@NC (2.08 × 102 S m−1), as delivered in Fig. S11.† This result is closely consistent with the fact that surface defects are the most important factor for improving the conductivity of metal oxides.37 It should be noted that the introduction of OV-TiO2−x (conductivity = 2.08 × 102 S m−1) does not dramatically decrease the overall conductivity of the OV-TiO2−x@NC (1.23 × 103 S m−1) when compared with that of the pure NC host (1.51 × 103 S m−1).
The porous structure was measured by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. S12†). Both TiO2@NC and OV-TiO2−x@NC host materials exhibit a typical IV adsorption isotherm with an evident hysteresis loop at a relative pressure (P/P0) from 0.5 to 1.0. The OV-TiO2−x@NC sample exhibits a specific surface area and pore volume of 290.2 m2 g−1 and 0.704 m3 g−1, respectively, which are slightly higher than those of TiO2@NC (217.8 m2 g−1 and 0.625 m3 g−1). The slightly higher specific area of OV-TiO2−x@NC is related to the release of more volume channels by hydrogen reduction.42 Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to determine the carbon content of the host materials under an air atmosphere (Fig. S13†). The carbon contents in the TiO2@NC and OV-TiO2−x@NC are 70.1 and 66.2%, respectively. The sulfur content in the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S was estimated to be as high as 78.3% (Fig. 3k). It is noteworthy that the slightly increased sulfur evaporation temperature can be detected in OV-TiO2−x@NC/S when compared with those of NC/S and TiO2@NC/S. This increase should be ascribed to the superior confinement of existing polar OV-TiO2−x towards sulfur.
To estimate the electrochemical performance of different as-synthesized electrodes, CR-2032 type coin cells were assembled under the same sulfur loading of 1.6 mg cm−2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were initially carried out in the voltage range of 1.7–2.8 V (vs. Li/Li+) with a sweep rate of 0.1 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 4a, there are two sharp cathodic peaks at 2.30 (Peak I) and 2.05 V (Peak II) for the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode, which is related to the conversion of sulfur (S8) into the soluble long-chain LiPSs (Li2Sx, 4 ≤ x ≤ 8) and the subsequent conversion to the insoluble short-chain Li2S2/Li2S, respectively.42 Additionally, two adjacent anodic peaks at 2.36 V (Peak IV) and 2.38 V (Peak III) correspond to the multistep transformation from Li2S2/Li2S to Li2Sx and eventually to S8.43 It is worth noting that only one anodic peak was observed for the NC/S and TiO2@NC/S cathodes. For the pure NC/S non-polar cathode, this is due to the slow redox kinetics of LiPSs, serious polarity and shuttle behaviors during the anodic process. While for the TiO2@NC/S cathode, it can be attributed to the low conductivities of TiO2 in the cathode that hinder the transfer of Li+ and reduce the electrochemical reversibility of the oxidation kinetics towards Li2S. In other words, TiO2 is less effective as a polysulfide electrocatalyst than OV-TiO2−x.44,45 Impressively, as depicted in Fig. 4b, S14 and S15,† the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode shows the highest reduction voltage and lowest oxidation voltage among the three different electrodes, indicating the enhanced catalytic activity decreases the polarization and accelerates the conversion of polysulfides.

The dosage of electrolyte is an essential factor for obtaining high energy density Li–S batteries; coin cells with different electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios for the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrodes were further evaluated (Fig. S16†). The optimized E/S ratio is precisely fixed at 15 μL mg−1 in this work based on the analysis. The galvanostatic charge–discharge plots of three electrodes under 0.2C (1C = 1675 mA h g−1) (Fig. 4c) exhibits two discharge plateaus, related to the reduction process (S8 → Li2Sx) and the subsequent conversion (Li2Sx → Li2S2/Li2S), respectively, which is in agreement with the CV curves based on the multi-step sulfur reaction mechanism.46,47 The capacities of the two discharge voltage platforms are labeled as ΔH1 and ΔH2, respectively, which represent the electrocatalytic ability of LiPSs during the conversion reaction. The ratio of ΔH2 to ΔH1 (denoted as ΔH2/ΔH1) is depicted in Fig. S17.† More importantly, the OV-TiO2−x@C/S electrode exhibits a lower polarization potential (ΔE1 = 164 mV) than that of TiO2@NC/S (ΔE2 = 186 mV) and NC/S (ΔE3 = 228 mV). The cycle stability of the electrodes under 0.2C is depicted in Fig. 4d, and the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode shows a remarkable first discharge capacity of 1372 mA h g−1, which is obviously higher than those of its counterparts, TiO2@NC/S (1166 mA h g−1) and C/S (1049 mA h g−1). It indicates a significant improvement in sulfur utilization. Remarkably, the OV-TiO2−x@C/S electrode remains 1194 mA h g−1 with a high capacity reservation of 87.0% for 300 cycles. For comparison, TiO2@NC/S and NC/S electrodes can only reach 828 and 414 mA h g−1, respectively, and the capacity retentions are lower by 69.3% and 39.5% due to the unsatisfactory adsorption of LiPSs and low utilization of sulfur species. Besides, the coulombic efficiency of TiO2@NC/S and NC/S electrodes fluctuates dramatically during the cycles, whereas the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode is rather stable and stays close to 100% during the cycles. The charge/discharge voltage profiles of the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode overlap well (Fig. 4e) when compared with TiO2@NC/S and NC/S electrodes (Fig. S18†), suggesting the high reversibility of the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S cathode. The pristine OV-TiO2−x@NC host material (without filling with sulfur) is further used as a control sample and tested to evaluate sulfur utilization in the first cycle and capacity contribution towards OV-TiO2−x@NC/S (Fig. S19†). The status of the separators and electrodes of Li–S batteries after cycling were also examined, as displayed in Fig. S20 and S21.† It further confirms that polar defect-rich titanium oxide will improve the electrochemistry of the sulfur electrode. Additionally, the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode also exhibits a superior discharge capacity of 953 mA h g−1 for 1000 cycles under 0.5C (Fig. S22†).
Given that the employment of efficient electrocatalysts can speed up the conversion of LiPSs and elevate lithium ion diffusion,39 CV curves under various scan rates of 0.1–0.5 mV s−1 (Fig. 4f and S23†) were recorded to study the different reaction kinetics behavior of the electrodes. The data from the kinetics experiment of the lithium ion diffusion rates were calculated by the peak current (i, mA) and scan rate (ν, mV s−1) according to the power law.48 The detailed information about the lithium ion diffusion process is indexed in Fig. S24.† The results demonstrate that the incorporation of OV-TiO2−x can efficiently accelerate the catalytic reaction kinetics of LiPSs. More importantly, the i values of all the cathodic and anodic peaks (A, B, and C) have a positive linear relationship with the square root of sweep rates (ν0.5), and the slope values of i/ν0.5 are matched and listed in Fig. 4g and S24d.† According to the Randles–Sevcik formula, the lithium-ion diffusion rate (DLi+) can be calculated from the slope of curves (i/ν0.5) (Table S1, ESI†). Apparently, the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode exhibits the sharpest slope and highest lithium ion diffusivity over the entire redox reaction when compared with TiO2@NC/S and NC/S electrodes. This higher value is beneficial for suppressing the shuttle effect, boosting the catalytic activity towards LiPSs conversion, facilitating Li+ transfer, and enhancing utilization of the sulfur species.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was executed to further examine the internal resistance of electrodes. As for the fresh electrodes (Fig. 4h), it shows a depressed semicircle and a linear feature in the high-to-middle and low-frequency area, which corresponds to the charge transfer resistance and diffusion of lithium ions into the electrode, respectively. In comparison with the fresh electrodes, the Nyquist plots of batteries after 100 cycles at 0.2C (Fig. 4i) display two poorly-resolved depressed semicircles. The second semicircles in addition to the original ones are due to the generation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer towards insoluble Li2S2/Li2S.49 It is worth noting that after cycling, obviously decreased semicircle diameters of Re at low frequency and the charge transfer impedance Rct are observed. The decrease of Re is associated with the gradual infiltration of electrolyte into the sulfur cathode. The decrease of Rct is correlated to the re-dispersion of sulfur and the activation of more electrochemical sites in the nanohybrids, which not only contribute to shortened pathways and better coverage between the sulfur and host materials, but also improve the interfacial properties of the liquid–solid conversion kinetics towards LiPSs.50 The Nyquist plot with minimum semicircles in the high-frequency regions reveals that the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode possesses the smallest charge transfer resistance, which is possibly due to the higher electronic conductivity of the OV-TiO2−x and stronger affinity towards LiPSs in OV-TiO2−x@NC. The kinetic differences between NC/S, TiO2@NC/S, and OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrodes are calculated by imitated AC impedance spectra according to the well-fitted Randles equivalent circuit diagram (Fig. S25†). The fitting results (Tables S2 and S3†) further verify that the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode delivers the lowest Re, Rs, and Rct values. Apparently, the NC/S and TiO2@NC/S electrodes show much higher Rs than the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode, demonstrating that a thicker layer of Li2S/Li2S2 is formed on the cathode surfaces during the cycling process. Additionally, the lithium-ion diffusion of the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode is demonstrated to be the fastest according to the calculation mode of the lithium-ion diffusion coefficient (Fig. S26†).
The prolonged cycle performance of the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode is further evaluated. As depicted in Fig. 5a, high capacities of 792 and 684 mA h g−1 can be obtained from the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode for 2000 cycles at 1 and 2C, respectively. Excitingly, the reversible capacity of the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode can also attain up to 531 mA h g−1 (63% capacity retention) after 3000 cycles under the high rate of 5C (Fig. 5b), which corresponds to the capacity fade of merely 0.0123% per cycle. At 5C, the cathode experienced the activation for the initial several cycles. The possible reason for this activation process that is seen only under a high rate can be ascribed to the weak electrochemical contacts between the electrolyte and internal sulfur particles during the initial few cycles in the typical “core–shell” nanostructure, which lead to partial reaction of sulfur with Li+, particularly at an ultra-high current rate (5C = 13.4 mA cm−2). More sulfur in the internal space gets wetted by the electrolyte as the cycling process goes on, generating more reactive sites for LiPSs, and the reversible capacity gradually increases and reaches the maximum value after a certain number of cycles.51,52 Meanwhile, high and stable CE close to 99% can be acquired, delivering brilliant durable cycle stability. The rate capabilities of the NC/S, TiO2@NC/S and OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrodes from 0.2C to 8C are exhibited in Fig. 5c. Obviously, the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode shows outstanding rate capability with the highest capacities of 1365, 1229, 1123, 1003 and 848 mA h g−1 under 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5C rates, respectively. Although at an ultra-high rate of 8C, the capacity is as high as 675 mA h g−1. After the current recovered to 0.2C, a high discharge capacity of 1274 mA h g−1 is regained with an indistinguishable capacity loss, demonstrating the high reversibility of the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode. In contrast, the TiO2@NC/S electrode exhibits an inferior capacity of 1145 mA h g−1 at 0.2C, and the capacity reduces dramatically to 536 and 406 mA h g−1 at 5C and 8C rates, respectively. As for the NC/S electrode, it undergoes the most capacity fading at the same stepwise rate. The related charge–discharge plots under various C-rates are exhibited in Fig. 5d and S27.† Excitingly, two representative voltage platforms at 8C rates are visible except for a slight voltage drop in the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode, indicating that the battery undergoes mild polarization. The superior rate performance of the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode can be explained by the strong electrocatalytic activity of defects, which provide a stronger chemical affinity and promote the conversion of LiPSs. Furthermore, the ultrathin feature can supply fast transfer pathways for electrons and ions.

(h) Comparison of the formation and reversible charge–discharge mechanism of the NC/S, TiO2@NC/S and OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrodes, respectively. 
The formation of the overpotential in the Li–S batteries mainly originated from the sluggish reaction of the nucleation and growth process of insoluble Li2S on the reactive interfaces.53–55 To further examine the catalytic effect, Li2S precipitation experiments were conducted on different host materials (details are indexed to the Experimental section of the ESI†). Fig. 5e–g verifies that the OV-TiO2−x@NC electrode displays faster and earlier responsivities toward Li2S nucleation than TiO2@NC and NC. The whole procedure for the reduction of Li2S8/Li2S6 and precipitation of Li2S have been mathematically modeled and distinguished by various colors. Based on Faraday's law, the OV-TiO2−x@NC electrode exhibits the largest capacity of Li2S deposition (142.3 mA h g−1), shortest nucleation and growth times when compared with those of NC (63.6 mA h g−1) and TiO2@NC (112.5 mA h g−1). The conclusions demonstrate that OV-TiO2−x@NC can dramatically decrease the overpotential of the original Li2S nucleation and substantially accelerate the subsequent Li2S deposition. In general, these outcomes reveal the advanced electrocatalytic ability of the OV-TiO2−x@NC host in decreasing the polarization and accelerating LiPSs conversion at the liquid–solid boundary. As shown in Fig. 5h, the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode shows high superiority for Li–S batteries. The cooperative effect of carbon and OV-TiO2−x components can restrict the shuttle effect of intermediate LiPSs through strong chemical adsorption, efficient conversion from S8 to Li2Sx, and controllable deposition sites of Li2S2/Li2S. All the above-mentioned factors endow the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode with high reversible capacity, rapid kinetics and durable lifespan. Contrarily, the TiO2@NC/S electrode with a weak catalytic ability and low conductivity may suffer from the increased charge-transfer resistance, inferior sulfur utilization and poor cycle performance. The NC/S electrode without polar components suffers from a serious shuttle effect and agglomeration of dead Li2S/Li2S2.
To further study the intrinsic catalytic capability of TiO2−x towards the LiPSs redox reaction and eliminate the influence of the lithium anode, symmetric batteries in the voltage ranging from −1.0 to +1.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) were tested (Fig. 6a). Comparatively, the EIS spectrum of the OV-TiO2−x@NC (Fig. 6b) symmetric cell delivers the smallest internal charge transfer resistance, demonstrating the fast charge transfer and rapid LiPSs redox reaction. The CV curves of various symmetric batteries under a sweep rate of 3 mV s−1 are also exhibited in Fig. 6c–e. As control experiments, the CV curves of the TiO2@NC battery (Fig. 6c) show a larger voltage hysteresis, much wider redox peaks and broader separations at −0.35/0.35 and −0.57/0.57 V, demonstrating its inferior catalytic capability. However, CV curves of the pure NC symmetric cell (Fig. 6d) experience more serious polarization with just one pair of prolonged wide redox peaks at −0.58/0.58 V, confirming the limit and sluggish LiPSs conversion without the electrocatalyst. Two distinguished pairs of redox peaks can be detected at −0.18/0.18 and −0.45/0.45 V for OV-TiO2−x@NC (Fig. 6e). These peaks emerge with sharpness and a narrow separation, revealing the enhanced highly reversible and rapid multi-step polysulfide conversion reactions.53 The above results also strongly suggest the minimum overpotential and quickest reaction kinetics of the LiPSs transformation towards OV-TiO2−x@NC. Additionally, OV-TiO2−x@NC further delivers the maximum peak area in the CV plots, demonstrating its strongest catalytic activity and the efficient utilization of sulfur. Such catalytic activity is responsible for the stable cycling performance and advanced electrochemical reversibility, as verified by the overlapping CV curves of the first five scans (Fig. 6f and S28†). Detailed reactions of these peaks in the working and counter electrodes are also summarized in Fig. S27.† At high sweep rate ranging over 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mV s−1, the redox peaks are also conserved with a tiny shift, confirming the highly efficient LiPSs conversion reaction in the OV-TiO2−x@NC symmetric cell (Fig. 6g).

(h) Tafel plots as well as the exchanges current densities of Li2S6 symmetric cells on different host materials. (i) LSV curves of the sulfide oxidation reaction for various hosts at 10 mV s−1. 
To further investigate the catalytic ability of the electrodes towards the LiPSs conversion reaction, the Tafel slope and exchange electrical current density were measured.52 As shown in Fig. 6h, rapid reaction kinetics can also be detected from the Tafel plots, and using the following formula, η = a + blgI(1)η and I represent the overpotential and current density, respectively. The Tafel slopes of the electrodes can be obtained from the linear portions of the plots, and the electrical current density can be fitted from the dashed straight lines. We assume single-redox behaviors even though more than one LiPS may be present due to disproportionation reactions. Based on the Tafel extrapolation method, the linear plots of the cathodic and anodic branches prolonging to the point where the overpotential is zero (the point at which the x-axis is 0) can be deemed as exchange current densities.56–58 Therefore, the calculated exchange electrical current densities of NC, TiO2@NC and OV-TiO2−x@NC are 7.98 × 10−4, 3.44 × 10−3 and 1.24 × 10−2 mA cm−2, respectively. Obviously, the OV-TiO2−x@NC electrode shows the highest anodic and cathodic branches. The superior exchange electrical current density of OV-TiO2−x@NC verifies the enhancement of LiPSs conversion. Hence, we conclude that TiO2−x as a catalyst in the OV-TiO2−x@NC host can accelerate the kinetics of the transformation process.
The electrocatalytic capability of OV-TiO2−x@NC toward Li2S oxidation is further evaluated via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests with the three-electrode battery, containing 0.1 M Li2S/methanol solution as the electrolyte, Ag/AgCl and platinum as the reference and counter electrode, respectively.59 As depicted in Fig. 6i, sulfide oxidation of the glassy carbon (control sample) results in delayed reaction kinetics with the smallest current responses and a comparatively large overpotential. The as-synthesized hosts show varying levels of kinetic enhancement and possess sensitive current responses. The OV-TiO2−x@NC host exhibits the lowest open potential at around −0.55 V when compared with TiO2@NC (−0.48 V) and NC (−0.40 V), the largest oxidation current and the highest current response, manifesting an effective oxidation process from solid Li2S to soluble LiPSs. It also exhibits significant catalytic activity for sulfur species, which ensures rapid and highly efficient sulfur conversions.
To further confirm that OV-TiO2−x has a strong immobilization ability towards LiPSs, optical observations were made by immersing equal amounts (5 mg) of NC, TiO2@NC and OV-TiO2−x@NC hosts into a 3 mM Li2S6 solution in the DOL and DME (1:1, in volume ratio). The digital images (Fig. 7a) were recorded after keeping the static state for 12 h. A visual difference is apparent among the four glass bottles. The blank Li2S6 solution is an intense golden yellow color, and the solution with the OV-TiO2−x@NC host is completely transparent after adsorption, demonstrating the superior adsorption ability towards Li2S6. This characteristic was further testified by dilution of the Li2S6 supernatant followed by examination with UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 7b). The solution with OV-TiO2−x@NC delivers the lowest absorbance peaks with a significantly weaker peak at around 260 cm−1 (referred to the Li2S6 species), which visually indicates the least amount of LiPSs residue in the supernatant and the greatest entrapment ability towards Li2S6.7

XPS measurements of the TiO2@NC and OV-TiO2−x@NC hosts after adsorbing Li2S6 were carried out to explore the fundamental chemical interactions between LiPSs and host materials, labeled as TiO2@NC–Li2S6 and OV-TiO2−x@NC–Li2S6. As shown in the high-resolution S 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 7c), the pristine Li2S6 shows two peaks (161.6 and 163.3 eV), which can be assigned to terminal (ST1−) and bridging (S0B) sulfur, respectively.60 After interacting with Li2S6, the peaks shift towards the high binding energy (0.2 eV) of the TiO2@NC–Li2S6, suggesting an increased electronic cloud density at the metallic center due to the chemical adsorption of TiO2@NC.61 At the same time, two new peaks emerge in the high binding energy region of the OV-TiO2−x@NC–Li2S6, which can be assigned to the sulfur–oxygen bonding in thiosulfate (167.5 eV) and sulfate (169.4 eV), respectively.62 Conspicuously, the OV-TiO2−x@NC–Li2S6 shows a more significant upshift of peaks towards higher binding energies (0.3 eV) compared to that of TiO2@NC–Li2S6, indicating the effective confinement of sulfur species due to the stronger chemical interaction with Li2S6. Analogously, the Li 1s spectra are further explored. As shown in Fig. 7d, the original Li2S6 delivers a representative peak at 55.3 eV, which is correlated to the Li–S bond.13 An additional peak emerges at 55.8 eV, corresponding to Li–O bond in the TiO2@NC–Li2S6. Furthermore, the peak of the OV-TiO2−x@NC–Li2S6 shifts to 55.6 eV at a lower binding energy, demonstrating the generation of a “lithium-bond”-like configuration that links the adsorbents with LiPSs and improves the adsorption ability. When compared with the OV-TiO2−x@NC host before adsorption (Fig. 7e), the Ti 2p spectra of OV-TiO2−x@NC–Li2S6 delivers a relatively small shift (0.3 eV) to lower binding energies, which is in accordance with the S 2p spectrum data. The existence of defects can partially adsorb LiPSs, thus enhancing electron density at the metal center. In contrast, no apparent change in the Ti 2p spectra of TiO2@NC–Li2S6 (Fig. S29†) is observed due to its weak chemical affinity. It is noteworthy that a new peak emerges at 454.9 eV in the Ti 2p spectrum for OV-TiO2−x@NC–Li2S6, which is related to the existence of a Ti–S bond and is beneficial for anchoring and immobilizing LiPSs.63 The formation of Ti–S bonds between non-saturable Ti-based metal cation centers (Lewis acid) and the terminal sulfur (ST) in the Sx2− (LiPSs) based on Lewis acid–base interactions is depicted in Fig. S30.† The O 1s and N 1s high-resolution XPS spectrum of the OV-TiO2−x@NC before and after adsorbing Li2S6 are also provided in Fig. S31,† demonstrating its strong chemical affinity towards LiPSs.
Density function theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to explore the chemical interactions between hosts and LiPSs. The optimized structures of C, TiO2 and TiO2−x from the top and side view are shown in Fig. S32.† Obviously, the geometrically molecular configurations of the original TiO2 (110) surface are different from TiO2−x when defect-rich sites were introduced. Furthermore, the interactions between TiO2−x (TiO2 or C) and LiPSs containing different sulfur chemical states (Li2S, Li2S2, Li2S4, Li2S6, and Li2S8) are presented in Fig. S33.† The optimized configurations of TiO2 (110)–Li2S6 and TiO2−x (110)–Li2S6 are also depicted in Fig. 7f, and the value of interaction energies between LiPSs, TiO2 and TiO2−x are in agreement with the previous reports.64,65 The results that demonstrate Li and S atoms in Li2S6 tend to incorporate with Ti and O atoms on the TiO2−x (110) surface, which is in agreement with the results of the above-mentioned XPS analysis. Moreover, the bond distances in the Ti–S (2.52 vs. 2.73 Å) and Li–O (1.93 vs. 1.95 Å) of the TiO2−x(110)–Li2S6 species are obviously shorter than that of TiO2(110)–Li2S6, which confirms the higher chemical affinity of OV-TiO2−x towards LiPSs. Consequently, the corresponding binding energies between TiO2−x and Li2S, Li2S2, Li2S4, Li2S6, and Li2S8 (Fig. 7g) are significantly higher than that of TiO2 and C. Similarly, the Ti–S and Li–O bond lengths in TiO2−x show the shortest distances (Fig. 7h) in all of the LiPSs-adsorbent couples, which further confirms the strong adsorption capability of the narrow band gap defect towards polysulfides. As proved by the energy density of states (DOS) (Fig. 7i), TiO2 and TiO2−x exhibit an unambiguous forbidden gap of spin-up and spin-down channels and possess the representative semiconductor characteristics. Furthermore, the DOS pattern of TiO2−x reveals a significantly rearranged state of valance electrons. More importantly, the oxygen atoms near the defect-rich site reduce the deficiency of the initial energy band structure, leading electrons under the Fermi level to jump into the defect level. Apparently, the energy band gap (Eg) of TiO2−x dramatically decreased from 1.454 eV to 1.170 eV due to the introduction of defects, demonstrating that OV can efficiently improve the electronic conductivity of TiO2. Therefore, the OV-TiO2−x creates an electron current carrier and reduces the obstacle for electrons transferring to the conductive band, which enhances the electrical conductivity and bonding strength.
To pursue high energy density Li–S batteries, OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrodes under elevated sulfur areal loading were further evaluated. As depicted in Fig. S34,† the galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles of the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode under various sulfur loadings of 3.3, 5.6 and 7.8 mg cm−2 at 0.2C show high areal capacities of 3.81, 5.62 and 6.65 mA h cm−2 (corresponding to the capacities of 1154, 1004 and 853 mA h g−1), respectively. Notably, the two distinct plateaus are still clearly visible under a sulfur loading of 7.8 mg cm−2, further demonstrating that well-designed OV-TiO2−x@NC/S possesses a small polarization and rapid LiPSs conversion kinetics. The cycling stability of OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrodes with different sulfur loading was tested and exhibited in Fig. 8a, where the high areal capacities of 3.41, 4.89, and 5.54 mA cm−2 (corresponding to the capacities of 1034, 873, and 710 mA h g−1, respectively) can be acquired, and high capacity retentions of 89.6%, 87.0%, and 83.2% after 200 cycles are also achieved. Besides, the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode also delivers excellent rate capabilities from 0.2 to 1C (Fig. 8b). Although at an ultra-high sulfur loading of 7.8 mg cm−2, the reversible capacities of 493 and 381 mA h g−1 at 0.8C and 1.0C, respectively, can be achieved. With increasing sulfur mass loading, the specific capacity and rate performance of the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode decreases slightly, which may originate from the saturation of interfacial contacts between the electrolytes and sulfur species, and the increased internal transfer resistances from the thickness of active materials.66 The OV-TiO2−x@C/S electrodes under a high areal loading mass of 9.5 mg cm−2 with a low E/S (=5 μL mg−1) ratio also exhibits typical voltage profiles with two plateaus (Fig. S35†). The electrode shows a high areal capacity of 9.78 mA h cm−2 after activating for several cycles at 0.05C under a mass loading of 9.5 mg cm−2, and the capacity slightly decreases to 8.01 mA h cm−2 for 100 cycles (Fig. 8c). The value is obviously higher than the current commercial LIBs (4 mA h cm−2). It is promising that the obtained high areal capacities of the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode are highly competitive with the reported sulfur electrodes (Fig. 8d and Tables S4–S6†). The cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. S36a†) of the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode shows a thickness of about 130 μm with a sulfur loading of 9.5 mg cm−2. The optical image (Fig. S36b†) and SEM images (Fig. S36c and d†) of the Li anode show relatively flat surfaces, and the corresponding EDS spectrum shows a very low amount of sulfur. The high areal capacity, stable cycle performance and high utilization rate of sulfur should be attributed to the synergistic effects between the ultrathin but compactly packed OV-TiO2−x inner shell and the N-doped carbon outer layer, in which the amphipathic interaction of OV-TiO2−x@NC can restrict LiPSs in the cathode with high efficiency and restrain the shuttle behavior.51 A schematic diagram of the affinity and catalytic transformation of LiPSs in the Li–S cell model based on the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode is exhibited (Fig. 8e). In detail, the hollow nano-architectures are beneficial for decreasing the volume expansion of sulfur species. The existence of OV-TiO2−x nanosites as strong trapping absorbers facilitates catalytic LiPSs conversion between long-chain LiPSs and short-chain Li2S/Li2S2 under rapid redox reaction kinetics, which can not only suppress the shuttle behavior but also improve the rate performance.

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, we successfully fabricated ultrathin “double-shell” defect-rich TiO2−x@nitrogen-doped carbon nanostructures as highly efficient sulfur hosts. The as-designed hollow N-doped carbon shell serves as a shortcut bridge that not only establishes good conductive pathways for electron transportation and ion transfer but also provides abundant cushion space to alleviate the volume changes of sulfur upon cycling. Furthermore, the ultrathin and compactly packed OV-TiO2−x inner layer can effectively furnish active interfaces for LiPSs conversion and also act as a strong immobilizer to prevent LiPSs loss from the electrolyte. Hence, it endows the as-synthesized OV-TiO2−x@NC with enhanced electrical conductivity, versatile catalytic activity, efficiently suppressed LiPS shuttling and accelerated LiPS redox kinetics. Benefiting from the porous carbon framework and ultrathin defect-rich structures, the OV-TiO2−x@NC/S electrode delivers a high reversible capacity of 1194 mA h g−1 for 300 cycles at 0.2C, a long cycle stability of 531 mA h g−1 for 3000 cycles under 5C (capacity decay of merely 0.0123%), a superior rate capability of 675 mA h g−1 at 8C and a high areal capacity of 8.01 mA h cm−2 under a sulfur loading mass of 9.5 mg cm−2 with minimal E/S ratio (5 μL mg−1). This work offers a novel viewpoint of defect engineering in catalysis towards high energy density Li–S batteries.
