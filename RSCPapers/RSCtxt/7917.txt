    , Accepted 1st February 2011First published on 14th March 2011AbstractTwo new heteroleptic ruthenium(II) photosensitizers that contains 2,2′;6,2′′-terpyridine with extended π-conjugation with donor groups, a 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine anchoring ligand and a thiocyanate ligand have been designed, synthesized and fully characterized by CHN, mass spectrometry, UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopies and cyclic voltammetry. The new sensitizers have either 3,5-di-tert-butyl phenyl (m-BL-5) or triphenylamine (m-BL-6) groups, where the molar extinction coefficient of both the sensitizers is higher than the analogous ruthenium dyes. Both the sensitizers were tested in dye-sensitized solar cells using two different redox electrolytes.
Introduction
Owing to their versatility and cost-effective manufacturing, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have long been considered as a feasible alternative to conventional solid-state p-n photovoltaic devices.1Dye-sensitized solar cells have reached the best efficiencies, approaching those exhibited by conventional systems such as amorphous silicon modules.2 In DSSC the dye sensitizer absorbs light to transfer an electron at the interface with the wide-gap TiO2 semiconductor and the resulting positive charge to the redox mediator with efficiencies reaching a maximum of 11.2% (AM 1.5).3 In order to enhance these efficiencies, several sensitizers based on ruthenium polypyridyl complexes, tetrapyrrolic compounds and organic molecules have been synthesized and tested in DSSC.4 The widely used charge-transfer sensitizers in such cells are bis(tetrabutylammonium)-cis-di(thiocyanato)-N,N′-bis(4-carboxylato-4′-carboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (the N719 dye) and trithiocyanato-4,4′4′′-tricaboxy-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine ruthenium(II) (the black dye), which have produced solar-energy-to-electricity conversion efficiencies (η) of >11% under AM 1.5 irradiation and display stable operation for millions of turnovers.5 The high efficiencies are due to suitable ground- and excited-state energy levels with respect to the nanocrystalline TiO2 conduction-band energy, molar absorption coefficient (ε), forcing the use of thicker TiO2 and the HOMO level of the redox couple iodine–triiodide. However, these dyes suffer from relatively thin layers, which reduces the open-circuit potential compared to thinner films.
Progress in the optimization of sensitizers has been made through increasing the molar absorption coefficient and expanding the light absorption capability.6 With regard to the former, DSSC could be made thinner and thus more efficient because of reduced transport losses in the nanoporous environment.7 With regard to the latter, dyes are designed to harvest solar energy across the entire visible and NIR regions of the spectrum with the aim of improving the short-circuit current JSC.8
Taking into account the above requirements, we have designed and synthesized two new heteroleptic ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes i.e., m-BL-5 and m-BL-6 sensitizers which have electron releasing groups on extended π-conjugation of a terpyridine ligand to increase the molar extinction coefficient,9 a bipyridine ligand with anchoring carboxyl groups to attach onto the TiO2 surface and a thiocyanate ligand to tune the redox properties of the ruthenium centre. Both the sensitizers have been completely characterized by elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, 1H NMR, UV-vis and emission spectroscopies and cyclic voltammetry. The photovoltaic performance of these sensitizers was studied by using two different redox electrolytes.

Characterization methods
The UV-Visible spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu model 1700 spectrophotometer. The steady state fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Spex model Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorometer for solutions having optical density at the wavelength of excitation (λ) ≈ 0.2. 1H NMR spectra were obtained at 300 MHz using a Brucker 300 Avance NMR spectrometer running X-WIN NMR software. The chemical shifts are relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS). The Fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectra of all the samples were measured using a Thermo Nicolet Nexus 670 spectrometer. Cyclic- and differential pulse voltammetric measurements were performed on a PC-controlled CH instruments model CHI 620 C electrochemical analyzer. Cyclic voltammetric experiments were performed on 1 mM dye solution in acetonitrile at scan rate of 100 mV s−1 using 0.1 M tetrabutyl ammoniumperchlorate (TBAP) as the supporting electrolyte. The working electrode was glassy carbon, the standard calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode and platinum wire was an auxillary electrode. After a cyclic voltammogram (CV) had been recorded, ferrocene was added, and a second voltammogram was measured.

Dye
          cell preparation
The detailed TiO2 photoelectrode (area: ca. 0.740 cm2) preparation was described in our earlier studies.12 Briefly, nanocrystalline TiO2 films of 8–8.5 μm thickness were deposited onto transparent conducting glass (Nippon Sheet Glass, which had been coated with a fluorine-doped stannic oxide layer, sheet resistance of 8–10 Ω cm−2) over which ∼4.5 μm thickness of 400 nm anatase TiO2 particles (CCIC, HPW-400) as scattering layer by screen-printing. These films were gradually sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. The heated electrodes were impregnated with a 0.04 M titanium tetrachloride solution in water saturated desiccator for 30 min at 70 °C and then washed with distilled water and rinsed with ethanol. The electrodes were heated again at 500 °C for 30 min and then allowed to cool to 50 °C before dipping them into the dye solution (3 × 10−4 M in ethanol). The electrodes were dipped into the dye solution for >18 h at 22 °C. The dye sensitized TiO2 electrodes were assembled with Pt counter electrodes by heating with a hot–melt Surlyn film (Surlyn 1702, 25 μm thickness, Du-Pont) as a spacer in between the electrodes. A liquid electrolyte was filled through the predrilled hole present on the counter electrode and then the hole was sealed with a Surlyn disk and a thin glass to avoid leakage of the electrolyte. The liquid electrolytes having the composition 1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), 30 mM I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GNCS) in the mixed solvent of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (v/v, 85:15) (here after labelled as Z959), and 1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), 30 mM I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GNCS), and 50 mM LiI in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (v/v, 85:15) (here after labelled as Z960).
The photovoltaic performance of these devices was characterized under a 450 W xenon light source (Osram XBO 450, USA), which is equivalent to an AM 1.5 solar simulator and was calibrated by using a Tempax 113 solar filter (Schott). In order to reduce scattered light from the edge of the glass electrodes of the dyed TiO2 layer, a light shading black mask was used onto the DSSCs. For photovoltaic measurements of the DSSCs, the irradiation source was a 450 W xenon light source (Osram XBO 450, Germany) with a filter (Schott 113), whose power was regulated to the AM 1.5 G solar standard by using a reference Si photodiode equipped with a colour matched filter (KG-3, Schott) in order to reduce the mismatch in the region of 350–750 nm between the simulated light and AM 1.5 G to less than 4%. The measurement of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was plotted as a function of excitation wavelength by using the incident light from a 300 W xenon lamp (ILC Technology, USA), which was focused through a Gemini-180 double monochromator (Jobin Yvon Ltd.). The measurement settling time between applying a voltage and measuring a current for the I–V characterization of DSSCs was fixed to 40 ms.
Results and discussion
The details of the synthetic strategy adopted for the synthesis of the m-BL-5 and m-BL-6 complexes are shown in Schemes 1 and 2. The Tpy-phosphonate was synthesized as per the reaction procedures reported for bipyridine precursors in the literature.13 The CC double bond was introduced at the 4,4′,4′′ positions of the terpyridine ligands, starting from their corresponding Tpy- phosphonate and condensed with either 3,5-di-tert-butyl benzaldehyde (m-BL-5 ligand) or N,N′-diphenyl amino benzaldehyde (m-BL-6 ligand) using a Wittig–Horner reaction.14 Both the m-BL-5 and m-BL-6 ligands were characterized by 1H NMR, Mass spectrometry and CHN analysis (see Supplementary information for Mass spectrometry and CHN data†). The synthesis of the Ru(II) complexes of m-BL-5 and m-BL-6 was performed following standard procedures; refluxing RuCl3·2H2O with the corresponding terpyridine ligand in a mixture of C2H5OH–CHCl3 to give the chloro complex. The chloro complex, 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine and aq. ammonium thiocyanate were refluxed in DMF to give the final m-BL-5 and m-BL-6 complexes after Sephadex column purification. Both the complexes were completely characterized by CHN analysis, Mass spectrometry, UV-vis, and fluorescence spectroscopies as well as cyclic voltammetry.

Photophysical characteristics

Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of m-BL-5 in ethanol and the corresponding data are presented in Table 1. The absorption bands between 400–550 nm can be ascribed to the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer transitions in the singlet manifold (1MLCT). The absorption maximum of m-BL-5 is centered at 523 nm whilst there is a shoulder band at 527nm. The molar extinction coefficient of the 523nm band is 10080 M−1 cm−1, whereas m-BL-6 absorption maxima is centered at 441 nm (ε = 25418 M−1 cm−1). The absorption maxima of m-BL-5 shows a bathochromic shift of 8 nm, when compared to that of the standard sensitizer N719. Intraligand π–π* transitions of the terpyridine ligand are located at 320 nm. In both the ruthenium(II) complexes, the absorption of 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine is located at 280 nm. Similar absorption properties were observed in other ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes in which bipyridine is an ancillary ligand and anchoring group(s) either carboxylic or phosphonate were present on the terpyridine ligand.15Fig. 1 also depicts the absorption spectra of m-BL-5 adsorbed onto 6 μm thick TiO2 film. The absorption features of both the complexes in solution as well as when anchored onto TiO2 are identical except for a slight red shift in the absorption maxima due to interaction of anchoring groups with the surface.11b A similar absorption spectrum was also observed in the case of m-BL-6 (see Supporting information†). The emission spectra of both m-BL-5 and m-BL-6 were measured in ethanol solvent and the m-BL-5emission spectrum is shown in Fig. 1. Excitation of a lower energy MLCT transition of the m-BL-5 and m-BL-6 sensitizers in ethanol produces an emission centered at 715 and 740 nm, respectively. Based on absorption and emission, the E0-0 energy of m-BL-5 and m-BL-6 is 1.65 and 1.75 eV, respectively.16 However, the emission of both the m-BL-5 and m-BL-6 sensitizers was quenched when adsorbed onto the TiO2 film as a consequence of electron injection from the excited state of Ru(II) into the conduction band of TiO2.

Electrochemistry

Table 1 presents the electrochemical properties of the two sensitizers m-BL-5 and m-BL-6, which were measured by cyclic and differential pulse voltammetric techniques in DMF solvent with 0.1 M tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate. Both m-BL-5 and m-BL-6 undergo one-electron irreversible oxidation at 0.95 and 0.90 V vs.SCE, respectively. The oxidation process can be assigned to the Ru(II)–Ru(III) couple, coupled with donor 3,5-di-tert-butyl phenyl (m-BL-5) or triphenylamine groups. Both the sensitizers show two quasireversible reduction peaks around −1.4 V, which we assign to the reduction of 2,2′-bipyridine dicarboxylic acid. The excited state oxidation potentials (Eox*) of the dyes (m-BL-5: −0.70 V vs.SCE; m-BL-6: −0.85 V vs.SCE) are much more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 at approximately −0.5 V vs.SCE.16
Computational study
To gain insight into the electronic structure of the m-BL-5 and m-BL-6dyes we performed DFT geometry optimizations and time-dependent DFT excited state calculations at the B3LYP/3-21G* level in the gas phase, by means of a C-PCM solvation model implemented in the Gaussian03 package.17 The results are compared in Fig. 2 with the corresponding data for the black dye and for a model TiO2 nanoparticle. As seen from Fig. 2, the first two HOMOs have essentially ruthenium t2g character with sizable contribution coming from the NCS ligand orbitals for both m-BL-5 and m-BL-6. HOMO-2 along with a contribution from ruthenium and the NCS ligand, also has a fairly large probability amplitude on the tri-phenylamine moiety for m-BL-6. On the other hand, in the N719 dye the first three HOMOs have ruthenium t2g character with sizable contribution coming from the NCS ligands.18 For m-BL-5 and m-BL-6 the LUMO and LUMO+2 are found to be π* orbitals localized on the 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine ligands with different localization, in which m-BL-5 show a favorable alignment with the TiO2 conduction band edge, which is consistent with the high photocurrents measured experimentally.

Thermal stability
We have examined the thermal stability of the new ruthenium(II) polypyridyl sensitizers and compared their thermal stability with that of the standard sensitizer using thermogravimetric analysis. Fig. 3 shows the thermal behaviour of m-BL-5. From the Figure it is clear that the sensitizer m-BL-5 is stable up to 200 °C. The initial weight loss between 200 to 250 °C is attributed to the removal of the carboxyl group. In contrast, the standard sensitizer N719 is stable up to 100 °C only.19 A similar thermal stability was also obtained in m-BL-6 and the black dye (see Supporting information†).

Photovoltaic measurements
Both sensitizers, m-BL-5 and m-BL-6, were anchored onto a double layer nanocystalline TiO2 film and their photovoltaic properties were measured using two electrolytes, Z959 and Z960. Table 2 illustrates the photovoltaic performance characteristics of m-BL-5, m-BL-6 at different light intensities. Fig. 4a shows the IPCE spectra of m-BL-5 and m-BL-6. We have observed maximum IPCE value of 66% at 550 nm in both the m-BL-5 and m-BL-6 sensitizers. The photocurrent action spectrum resembles the absorption spectra except for a slight red shift by ca. 15 nm. The photoresponse of thin films displays a broad spectral response covering the entire visible spectrum up to 800 nm. From the overlap integral of this curve one measures a short-circuit photocurrent density of 10.40 and 10.60 ± 0.20 mA cm−2 using the m-BL-5 and m-BL-6 sensitizers. Fig. 4b shows current–voltage characteristics of the cells with the two sensitizers. Under standard global Air Mass (AM) 1.5 solar conditions, the m-BL-5 sensitizer based cell gave a short-circuit photocurrent density (iSC) of 10.40 ± 0.20 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 684 ± 30 mV and a fill factor (ff) of 0.77 ± 0.03, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency η, derived from the equation: η = iSCVOC ff/light intensity of 5.40%. Under the same conditions, the m-BL-6 sensitized solar cell showed an iSC of 10.00 ± 0.20 mA cm−2, a VOC of 632 ± 30 mV, an ff of 0.78 ± 0.03, and an η value of 4.90% (see Table 2 and Fig. 4(b)). The high concentration of LiI in Z960 decreases the VOC by 20–30 mV due to a positive shift of band edge but increases the driving force for electron injection20 leading to a >30% increase in the photocurrent density. In consequence, Z960 involving LiI yielded a higher performance for both sensitizers.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized two new heteroleptic ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes with a bipyridine and terpyridine ligands in the same complex. The presence of electron releasing groups with extended π-conjugation of a terpyridine ligand increases the molar absorption coefficient. Both the new sensitizers m-BL-5 and m-BL-6 where tested in DSSC devices using volatile and non-volatile liquid redox electrolytes. The m-BL-5 sensitizer exhibited superior performance compared to the m-BL-6 sensitizer.
