Herein, we report a facile all-electrochemical approach to fabricate well-aligned ZnO–CdSe core–shell nanorod arrays with excellent uniformity on transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. The shell thickness of the core–shell nanorods can be tuned precisely by adjusting the charge density passing through the working electrode during the deposition of CdSe quantum dots (QDs). The optimized ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays showed excellent PEC performance with a significant saturated photocurrent density of 14.9 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V (vs. RHE) under AM 1.5 illumination, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest value ever reported for similar nanostructures, owing to the favourable band alignment and good distribution of CdSe QDs on ZnO nanorods. Our results demonstrate that the electrochemically deposited ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays can be utilized as efficient photoanodes in PEC water splitting cells.1. IntroductionSevere environmental issues along with the forthcoming energy crisis have revived scientists' enthusiasm for developing clean and sustainable energy resources. As a promising renewable energy technology, photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen generation has attracted extensive attention since the pioneering work by Fujishima and Honda.1–4 More recently, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures (e.g., nanorods, nanowires and nanotubes) of wide bandgap semiconductors, such as ZnO and TiO2, have been successfully developed and applied in various emerging PEC applications.5–14 Compared to their bulk counterparts, these single-crystalline nanostructures can orthogonalize the directions of light absorption and minority carrier transport and provide direct electrical pathways, which enhance the utilization of minority carriers and improve the overall performance of photoelectrochemical devices. However, the power conversion efficiency of pure ZnO and TiO2 nanostructures is limited by their poor absorption of visible-light, due to their relatively large bandgap (>3.2 eV). Quantum dot (QD) sensitization is an effective way to extend the photo-response of ZnO or TiO2 to visible light. Many narrow bandgap semiconductor QDs, such as CdS, CdSe and CdTe, have been used to sensitize ZnO and TiO2 nanofilms.15–27 These modifications have significantly improved the overall energy conversion efficiency in photovoltaic and PEC devices, owing to the favorable visible-light response and tunable band structures of QDs. In general, the QD sensitization can be accomplished by adopting two different strategies. The first strategy involves direct growth of QDs on the surface of metal oxide electrodes, through chemical bath deposition,28,29 successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction25,30,31 or electrochemical deposition.15 Alternatively, pre-synthesized colloidal QDs can be attached to the metal oxide matrix with direct adsorption or linker-assisted adsorption. Among these methods, electrochemical deposition is most preferable, as it is simple, efficient, scalable and cost effective for producing semiconductor QDs with controllable density and excellent uniformity.In the present study, we demonstrate a facile and efficient method for the fabrication of ZnO–CdSe QD core–shell nanorod arrays through an all-electrochemical approach, in which both ZnO nanorods and CdSe QDs were electrochemically deposited onto the ITO electrode. The CdSe QDs form a type II band alignment with ZnO,32 resulting in efficient injection of photo-generated electrons from CdSe to ZnO. The structural and optical properties of the as-fabricated electrodes were characterized using various techniques including scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and UV-vis spectroscopy. The optimized ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays can generate a significant photocurrent density of 14.9 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V (vs. RHE) in 0.2 M Na2S, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest value ever reported for similar nanostructures. These ZnO–CdSe photoanodes exhibited excellent stability and apparently enhanced incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE). All these results showed their application potential for efficient PEC water splitting to produce hydrogen.2. Experimental section2.1. MaterialsAll chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used directly without further purification. Deionized water (resistivity over 18 MΩ cm) from a Millipore Q water purification system was used in all experiments.2.2. Electrochemical deposition of ZnO nanorodsPrior to the deposition of ZnO nanorods, the ITO coated glass substrates (Shenzhen JMT Glass Co., Ltd, 12 Ω □−1) were cleaned with detergent under sonication for 90 min, followed by washing with deionized water. Then, ZnO nanorods were deposited onto the pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates using an electrochemical approach. The deposition of ZnO nanorods was carried out in a 50 ml three-chambered electrochemical cell. 40 ml of aqueous solution containing 5 mM Zn(NO3)2 and 50 mM NaNO3 (pH = 9) was used as the electrolyte, and the temperature was kept at 85 °C in a hot water bath. Pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass, platinum (Pt) foil and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively.The ZnO nanorod arrays were deposited onto ITO-coated glass substrates using a multi-potential step technique. A ZnO seed-layer was first deposited on ITO with a potential of −1.3 V vs. SCE for 10 seconds. Thereafter, a constant potential of −1.0 V vs. SCE was applied for 2000 seconds. After the deposition, the as-prepared films were rinsed with DI water, dried with compressed N2 flow and then annealed at 350 °C in air.2.3. Electrochemical deposition of CdSe quantum dotsThe CdSe quantum dots were electrochemically deposited onto ZnO nanorod arrays from a solution of 10 mM CdCl2 and 5 mM elemental Se in 30 ml of DMF inside a 50 ml two-neck round-bottom flask. The electrodeposition was conducted at 125 °C using a two-electrode set-up, with ITO–ZnO or bare ITO as the working electrode and a Pt plate as the counter electrode. During deposition, a constant current density of −0.55 mA cm−2 was applied to the ITO–ZnO working electrode. The deposition time was varied from 50 seconds to 400 seconds to optimize the coverage of CdSe QDs on ZnO nanorod arrays.2.4. Material characterizationThe crystal structure, morphology and chemical composition of the core–shell nanorod arrays were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker AXS D8 Advance), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 30) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, JEOL JED-2300 Analysis Station), respectively. The light absorption properties were measured using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 UV-vis-NIR spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere.2.5. Photoelectrochemical measurementsThe photoelectrochemical tests were performed using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760D). A three-electrode set-up, with a platinum plate (1 cm × 2 cm) and a SCE (in 3 M KCl) as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively, was used to study the illuminated open circuit potential and photocurrent–voltage (J–V) behaviours of the samples. Meanwhile, the zero-bias photocurrent and stability tests were carried out using a two-electrode set-up, in which the working electrode (ZnO, CdSe and ZnO–CdSe) and the counter electrode (Pt) were short-circuited. 0.2 M Na2S (pH = 13) was preferentially used as the electrolyte in photoelectrochemical measurements, while 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6.9) was also used for scavenger-free tests. Prior to each measurement, the electrolyte was deaerated by purging it with nitrogen continuously for 30 minutes. A 300 W xenon lamp (Newport) coupled to an AM 1.5G filter was used as the standard light source throughout the tests. The illumination intensity on the surface of electrodes was ∼100 mW cm−2, calibrated using a standard silicon photodiode. All potentials in photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves were converted to the RHE scale.2.6. IPCE measurementsThe incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured under zero-bias (two-electrode, short-circuit) condition. The monochromatic light was supplied by a xenon lamp illuminating through a monochromator (Newport). A chopper was placed in front of the monochromator, and the signal was collected using a lock-in radiometry (Merlin) after amplification by the current preamplifier.3. Results and discussion3.1. Material characterizationIn our present work, all photoelectrodes (ZnO nanorod arrays, CdSe thin film and ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays) were prepared through an electrochemical deposition technique. The fabrication of ZnO–CdSe core–shell nanorod arrays is shown schematically in Fig. 1. Fig. 1  Fabrication of the ZnO–CdSe core–shell nanorod arrays through a solution based all-electrochemical approach, and their application as photoanodes in photoelectrochemical water splitting cells. Fig. 2a and b show typical field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of the ZnO nanorod arrays prepared using electrochemical deposition. From these FESEM images, it is observed that the entire surface of the ITO substrate is evenly covered with ZnO nanorods. The ZnO nanorods exhibit a regular hexagonal cross-section with flat top surfaces. The average diameter and length of the ZnO nanorods are ∼150 nm and ∼1 μm, respectively. Using the ZnO nanorod arrays as the working electrode, CdSe QD shells with controllable thicknesses can be further deposited galvanostatically onto the ZnO nanorods to form a core–shell nanostructure. The CdSe nanocrystals were precipitated on the surface of ZnO nanorods through the following redox reaction:33 Cd2+ + Se + 2e− → CdSe(1) Fig. 2  (a) Top and (b) cross-sectional view FESEM images of oriented ZnO nanorod arrays. (c) Top and (d) cross-sectional view FESEM images of ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays. (e) XRD patterns of the ITO substrate, ZnO nanorod arrays and ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays. (f) UV-visible absorption spectra of ZnO nanorod arrays, CdSe thin film and ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays. Fig. 2c shows the morphologies of the ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays prepared after 250 seconds of CdSe deposition, with a total charge transport of about 0.138 C cm−2. It can be observed that the surface of ZnO nanorods is fully covered with a dense and uniform outer shell, which is made up of numerous CdSe QDs with diameters around 10 ± 5 nm. The CdSe shell thickness is about 40 nm, which can be further tuned by adjusting the electrochemical deposition time. The cross-sectional FESEM image (Fig. 1d) shows that the CdSe QDs are uniformly distributed along the entire length of the ZnO nanorods. The core–shell configuration is further revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement, shown in Fig. S1,† in which the compact cable-like nanostructure along with the tight interface formed between ZnO and CdSe can be clearly seen. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. S2†) affirms the atomic ratio between Cd and Se atoms close to unity, which is consistent with the theoretical stoichiometric ratio of CdSe.Fig. 2e shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the bare ITO substrate, ZnO nanorod arrays and ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays. From the XRD spectrum of ZnO nanorod arrays, 6 diffraction peaks, namely (100), (002), (101), (102), (110) and (103) of wurtzite ZnO (JCPDS no. 79-2205), can be clearly identified. The predominant (002) peak indicates that the ZnO nanorods grow along the [001] direction with their growth axis nearly perpendicular to the ITO surface. After the deposition of CdSe QDs, major diffraction peaks of ZnO are still identifiable, suggesting that the electrochemical deposition does not affect the crystalline structure of ZnO. In addition, three new diffraction peaks centered at 24, 25.3 and 27.5°, which can be indexed to the (100), (002) and (101) planes of wurtzite CdSe (JCPDS no. 77-2307), are observed in the XRD spectrum of ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays. As shown in Fig. S4,† high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis was also performed to examine the crystal quality of ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays. The HRTEM image reveals the interplanar spacing of 0.26 nm and 0.35 nm, corresponding to the (002) crystal plane of wurtzite ZnO and the (002) crystal plane of wurtzite CdSe, respectively.Fig. 2f shows the optical absorption spectra of ZnO nanorod arrays, CdSe thin film and ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays. A steep absorption edge at 390 nm was observed in ZnO nanorod arrays, which is consistent with the wide bandgap of ZnO (3.2 eV). After coating a thin layer of CdSe QD shells, the absorption edge of the core–shell ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays was drastically extended to about 600 nm.3.2. Photoelectrochemical testsThe photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a three-electrode cell, with the electrodeposited film (ZnO, CdSe and ZnO–CdSe) on ITO as the working electrode, a Pt plate as the counter electrode, and a SCE electrode (in 3 M KCl) as the reference. The photoresponses were recorded in 0.2 M Na2S aqueous solution under AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination. To obtain the optimum deposition conditions of CdSe QDs, ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays with varied deposition time were prepared. Fig. S4a† shows the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of ZnO–CdSe samples prepared with different CdSe deposition times ranging from 50 seconds to 400 seconds, corresponding to 0.028–0.22 C cm−2 of total charge passing through the working electrode during the deposition. The observed photocurrent density first increases with increasing CdSe deposition time, reaching a maximum value, and then decreases as shown in Fig. S4b.† Initially, the amount of CdSe QDs deposited on the surface of ZnO nanorods increases with time, leading to better visible-light absorption and thus more efficient exciton generation. However, if the deposition time is too long, an excessive amount of CdSe QDs deposited may cause the aggregation of CdSe QDs (Fig. S5†), which increases the recombination loss of photo-generated excitons (excitons have to diffuse longer to reach the CdSe–ZnO interface for charge separation). As a result, the optimized CdSe QD deposition time would be around 225–275 seconds (0.12–0.15 C cm−2). Further experiments were carried out using the ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays prepared with a CdSe deposition time of 250 seconds (0.138 C cm−2).Photovoltage responses of ZnO nanorod arrays, CdSe thin film and ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays towards on–off cycles under AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination are shown in Fig. 3a. The illuminated open-circuit potentials are 0.41, 0.32 and 0.15 V for ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays, CdSe thin film and ZnO nanorod arrays, respectively. The ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays and CdSe thin film exhibited steady and highly repeatable photovoltage responses during on–off cycles of irradiation. Fig. 3b shows the photocurrent profiles of these photoanodes recorded under zero-bias (two-electrode, short circuit) condition. In each on–off cycle, a transient spike induced by the diffusion of charge carriers was observed. Thereafter, steady photocurrent was recorded, due to the formation of a diffusion layer at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte.34 ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays can produce a steady photocurrent density of about 1.22 mA cm−2, which is 4.9 and 61 times higher than that of the CdSe thin film (0.25 mA cm−2) and ZnO nanorod arrays (0.02 mA cm−2), respectively. Fig. 3  (a) Illuminated open-circuit-potential and (b) zero-biased photocurrent responses of ZnO nanorod arrays, CdSe thin film and ZnO/CdSe nanorod arrays towards on-off cycles of AM 1.5 illumination. Photocurrent-photovoltage (J–V) curves of different photoanodes obtained (c) in the dark, and (d) under illumination conditions. (e) Stability test of ZnO/CdSe nanorod arrays conducted under chopped AM1.5 illumination in zero-bias condition. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the three photoanodes obtained in the dark and under illumination are shown in Fig. 3c and d, respectively. In each measurement, the voltage was linearly swept from −0.4 V to 1.0 V (vs. RHE) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. In the dark, the J–V curves of all samples exhibited typical rectifying behaviour, with weak current responses less than 0.19 mA cm−2. Under simulated solar illumination, the ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays can generate a large photocurrent of 14.9 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V (vs. RHE), which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest value ever reported for similar nanostructured materials (Table S1†) and is 3.8 times and 86.9 times higher than the values of the CdSe thin film and ZnO nanorod arrays. These results affirm the efficient visible light absorption and interfacial charge transfer between CdSe QDs and ZnO nanorods. It is noteworthy that large amounts of H2 bubbles were observed on the surface of the Pt counter electrode during the PEC tests of ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays (ESI-Video 1†).To further investigate the application potential of ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays in practical solar water splitting applications, we also performed PEC tests in a scavenger-free electrolyte (0.5 M Na2SO4, pH = 6.9) as shown in Fig. S7.† The result shows that the ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays can produce a photocurrent of ∼2.75 mA cm−2 without using any sacrificial agents. A noticeable amount of H2 bubbles can be observed on the Pt counter electrode during the test.3.3. Stability testThe stability of ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays was examined with chopped simulated solar illumination, under zero-bias condition in 0.2 M Na2S. As shown in Fig. 3e, the ZnO–CdSe nanorod array photoanode can well retain ∼95.1% of its initial response after 65 on–off chopped lighting cycles, with a total test duration of 2600 seconds. H2 bubbles were generated on the surface of the Pt counter electrode upon illumination throughout the entire test, and there is no significant change in the colour of ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays after the stability test. To further verify the stability of ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays, we also conducted stability tests using continuous light illumination with the same sample. We found that ∼86.2% of its initial photocurrent density can be retained after 3600 s (Fig. S8†).3.4. Incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE)Incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed under zero-bias condition to probe the origin of photocurrent generation as a function of incident light wavelength. As shown in Fig. 4, the IPCE spectra of the three samples are consistent with their corresponding UV-vis spectra and J–V curves. The ZnO nanorod arrays show negligible IPCE below the ZnO band gap energy of ∼390 nm (bandgap of bulk ZnO is 3.2 eV), closely following their small photocurrent shown in Fig. 3b. In comparison with pristine ZnO nanorods, the ZnO–CdSe nanorods showed a pronounced response in the visible light region, with a maximum IPCE value of 34.9% obtained at ∼475 nm. The incorporation of the CdSe QD shell apparently enhanced the visible light absorption of the nanoarrays, thus leading to a significant increment in IPCE. Fig. 4  Dependence of the incident photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) on the incident wavelength of different electrodes; the inset shows the scheme of charge transfer on ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays under illumination. The inset in Fig. 4 illustrates the energy diagram of ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays. As shown in the diagram, both the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence-band maximum (VBM) of CdSe are higher than those of ZnO, forming a typical type II band alignment (staggered gap). With this advantageous configuration, the photogenerated electrons can be efficiently transferred from the CdSe QDs to ZnO nanorods, and then transported to the substrate along the direct path provided by single-crystal ZnO nanorods. In addition, the excellent uniformity of CdSe QDs on ZnO nanorods further enhanced the photoconversion efficiency.35 The good distribution of CdSe QDs has been achieved by utilizing the electrochemical deposition approach, which allows the homogeneous deposition of CdSe to take place across the entire area on ZnO nanorods.4. ConclusionIn summary, ZnO–CdSe core–shell nanorod arrays with excellent uniformity have been successfully fabricated through a facile and efficient all-electrochemical approach. The favorable band alignment and good CdSe QD distribution contribute to the effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and transportation of the electrons to the electrode surface, thus leading to a significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical performance and remarkable stability of the core–shell nanorod arrays. This work shows the application potential of ZnO–CdSe nanorod arrays as photoanodes for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting applications. In addition, we also demonstrated that the all-electrochemical deposition method utilized in this work could be a safe, efficient and cost-effective strategy for fabricating similar nanomaterials on a large scale.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported partially by the fund provided by the Singapore-Berkeley Research Initiative for Sustainable Energy (SinBeRise) and partially by the Energy Research Institute@NTU.Notes and referencesA.
